https://openalex.org/W1519521580,"Genes and mechanisms involved in common complex diseases, such as the autoimmune disorders that affect approximately 5% of the population, remain obscure. Here we identify polymorphisms of the cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 gene (CTLA4)--which encodes a vital negative regulatory molecule of the immune system--as candidates for primary determinants of risk of the common autoimmune disorders Graves' disease, autoimmune hypothyroidism and type 1 diabetes. In humans, disease susceptibility was mapped to a non-coding 6.1 kb 3' region of CTLA4, the common allelic variation of which was correlated with lower messenger RNA levels of the soluble alternative splice form of CTLA4. In the mouse model of type 1 diabetes, susceptibility was also associated with variation in CTLA-4 gene splicing with reduced production of a splice form encoding a molecule lacking the CD80/CD86 ligand-binding domain. Genetic mapping of variants conferring a small disease risk can identify pathways in complex disorders, as exemplified by our discovery of inherited, quantitative alterations of CTLA4 contributing to autoimmune tissue destruction."

https://openalex.org/W2102951681,"The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21Cip1 has important roles in the control of cell proliferation, differentiation, senescence, and apoptosis. It has been observed that p21 is a highly unstable protein, but the mechanisms of its degradation remained unknown. We show here that p21 is a good substrate for an SCF (Skp1-Cullin1-F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase complex, which contains the F-box protein Skp2 (S phase kinase-associated protein 2) and the accessory protein Cks1 (cyclin kinase subunit 1). A similar ubiquitin ligase complex has been previously shown to be involved in the degradation of a related cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p27Kip1. The levels of Skp2 oscillate in the cell cycle, reaching a maximum in S phase. The ubiquitylation of p21 in vitro required the supplementation of all components of the SCF complex as well as of Cks1 and Cdk2-cyclin E. The protein kinase Cdk2-cyclin E acts both by the phosphorylation of p21 on Ser-130 and by the formation of a complex with p21, which is required for its presentation to the ubiquitin ligase. As opposed to the case of p27, the phosphorylation of p21 stimulates its ubiquitylation but is not absolutely required for this process. Levels of p21 are higher in Skp2-/- mouse embryo fibroblasts than in wild-type fibroblasts in the S phase, and the rates of the degradation of p21 are slower in cells that lack Skp2. It is suggested that SCFSkp2 participates in the degradation of p21 in the S phase."

In vitro, fibrillization of recombinant tau can be induced by treatment with various agents, including phosphotransferases, polyanionic compounds, and fatty acids. Here we characterize the structural features required for the fatty acid class of tau fibrillization inducer using recombinant full-length tau protein, arachidonic acid, and a series of straight chain anionic, cationic, and nonionic detergents. Induction of measurable tau fibrillization required an alkyl chain length of at least 12 carbons and a negative charge consisting of carboxylate, sulfonate, or sulfate moieties. All detergents and fatty acids were micellar at active concentrations, due to a profound, taudependent depression of their critical micelle concentrations. Anionic surfaces larger than detergent micelles, such as those supplied by phosphatidylserine vesicles, also induced tau fibrillization with resultant filaments originating from their surface. These data suggest that anionic surfaces presented as micelles or vesicles can serve to nucleate tau fibrillization, that this mechanism underlies the activity of fatty acid inducers, and that anionic membranes may serve this function in vivo.

Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized in part by a constellation of intracellular neurofibrillary lesions termed neurofibrillary tangles, neuritic plaques, and neuropil threads (1Trojanowski J.Q. Shin R.W. Schmidt M.L. Lee V.M. Neurobiol. Aging. 1995; 16: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Each manifestation of neurofibrillary pathology is comprised of tau protein polymerized into filaments. Because neurofibrillary lesions appear with a stereotypic spatial distribution (2Feany M.B.

Neurol. 2002; 177: 475-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), they are useful markers of degeneration in Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. There is much interest, therefore, in identifying cellular components that initiate tau filament formation in disease. Fibrillization of recombinant, full-length tau protein in vitro does not occur spontaneously at physiological concentrations (6King M.E. Ahuja V. Binder L.I. Kuret J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14851-14859Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). However, tau protein can be induced to fibrillize by changes in its primary structure (7von Bergen M. Barghorn S.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 344-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar); or by addition of fatty acids (14Wilson D.M. Binder L.I. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 150: 2181-2195PubMed Google Scholar). Of these, fatty acids are especially efficacious in promoting the fibrillization of full-length tau protein at near physiological pH, temperature, reducing environment, ionic strength, and tau protein concentration (14Wilson D.M. Binder L.I. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 150: 2181-2195PubMed Google Scholar, 15Khatoon S. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 750-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the mechanism by which fatty acids induce tau fibrillization is unkown. Fatty acids resemble detergents in having hydrophobic alkyl chains and charged (anionic) head groups. Above their critical micelle concentrations (CMCs) 1The abbreviations used are: CMC, critical micelle concentration; AA, arachidonic acid. in aqueous solution, fatty acids form micelles in which their hydrophobic moieties are sequestered, and their charged head groups are exposed to solvent. We (6King M.E. Ahuja V. Binder L.I. Kuret J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14851-14859Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and others (16Barghorn S. Mandelkow E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14885-14896Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) have argued that the behavior of fatty acids such as arachidonic acid in assays of tau aggregation was consistent with it acting in micellar form. Yet fatty acids induce tau fibrillization at concentrations well below their measured CMC values (14Wilson D.M. Binder L.I. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 150: 2181-2195PubMed Google Scholar). As free monomers, fatty acids have been shown to reversibly bind proteins through specific high-affinity motifs (17Schroeder F. Jolly C.A. Cho T.H. Frolov A. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1998; 92: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Although such motifs have been suggested to exist in α-synuclein (18Sharon R. Goldberg M.S. Bar-Josef I. Betensky R.A. Shen J. Selkoe D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9110-9115Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), a protein that forms amyloid filaments in Parkinson's disease (19Spillantini M.G.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2552-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar), they have not been found in human tau protein. Here we examine the importance of alkyl chain length, chemical nature of the charged head group, and CMC for induction of tau polymerization using arachidonic acid, a series of ionic and nonionic synthetic detergents, and the anionic lipid phosphatidylserine. The results show that fatty acids induce tau fibrillization in micellar form without stoichiometric incorporation into filaments. The micelles must be negatively charged to promote fibrillization of full-length tau protein and, in the case of alkyl sulfate detergents, must contain at least 38 mol % negatively charged species. Because anionic lipids also induce tau fibrillization, it is proposed that intracellular membranes represent a class of physiologically relevant, intracellular tau polymerization inducers. Materials—Recombinant, His-tagged tau protein (htau40) was purified as described previously (22Carmel G. Mager E.M. Binder L.I. Kuret J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32789-32795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Arachidonic acid (AA) and [14C]AA (55 Ci/mol) were obtained from Cayman Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI) and American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO), respectively, and stored at –80 °C under argon. Palmitoleic and stearic acids were from Sigma. Alkyl sulfate detergents (12–20 carbons) were obtained from Mallinckrodt (Paris, KY), Acros Organics (Morris Plains, NJ), Lancaster Synthesis (Pelham, NH), and Research Plus (Bayonne, NJ) as sodium salts. Alkyl sulfonate detergents (6–18 carbons) were obtained as sodium salts from Research Plus. Nonionic and cationic detergents (bromide salts) were purchased from Sigma (C10E8, C12E23, C14E8, and C21H46BrN), and Fluka (Milwaukee, WI; C8E4, C10E6, C19H42BrN, and C15H34BrN). Porcine brain l-α-phosphatidylserine (containing mostly 18:0 and 18:1 fatty acid chains) was from Avanti Polar-Lipids (Alabaster, AL). All detergent stock solutions were prepared in water, Me2SO, or 1:1 water:isopropanol and stored at –20 °C. N-Phenyl-1-naphthylamine was from Sigma. Tau Polymerization Assays—Under standard conditions, htau40 (4–8 μm) was incubated with AA or other polymerization inducers (1–500 μm) in Assembly Buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, and 5 mm dithiothreitol) at either room temperature or 37 °C for 3–6 h. Samples were processed for electron microscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, or ultracentrifugation as described below. Electron Microscopy—Aliquots of tau polymerization reactions were taken, treated with 2% glutaraldehyde (final concentration), mounted on formvar/carbon-coated 300 mesh grids, and negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate as described previously (6King M.E. Ahuja V. Binder L.I. Kuret J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14851-14859Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Images were viewed in a Phillips CM 12 transmission electron microscope operated at 65 kV. Random images were captured on film at ×8,000 to ×22,000 magnification, digitized at 600 dots-per-inch resolution, and imported into Optimas 6.5.1 for quantification of filament lengths and numbers (6King M.E. Ahuja V. Binder L.I. Kuret J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14851-14859Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Individual filaments were defined as any object greater than 50 nm in its long axis and were counted manually. Ultracentrifugation—Tau polymerization reactions were centrifuged (400,000 × g, 30 min) in an Optima TLX ultracentrifuge (TLA 100.2 rotor). The resultant pellets were washed three times with Assembly Buffer and then dissolved in 5% C12H25SO4Na containing 0.01 m NaOH. The amount of protein in the supernatant and pellet fractions was determined by the Coomassie Blue binding method (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217547) Google Scholar) using purified, recombinant htau40 as standard. Arachidonic Acid Binding Stoichiometry—Tau protein (8 μm) was subjected to polymerization as described above, except that AA was 14C-radiolabeled at a final specific activity of 25 Ci/mol. Reaction products were subjected to ultracentrifugation, and aliquots of the resultant supernatants and resuspended pellets were assayed for protein and [14C]AA by scintillation spectroscopy. CMC Measurements—Detergents or lipids suspended in Assembly Buffer at varying concentrations (1 μm to 10 mm) were incubated for 1 h (at 37 °C or room temperature) in the presence of 10 μm N-phenyl-1-naphthylamine, after which fluorescence intensity was read directly in a PTI fluorimeter (λex = 346 nm, λem = 420 nm, 1 nm bandwidth, 800 V, gain 12.5, and slit 16) jacketed at 37 °C. When present, htau40 was maintained at 4 μm. CMCs were estimated from abscissa intercepts after least squares linear regression as described previously (24Brito R.M. Vaz W.L. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 152: 250-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) and expressed as CMC ± S.E. of the estimate. Only data points within 5-fold of the CMC were used to calculate CMC. CMC values for alkyl sulfate detergents in water at 40 °C were calculated as described previously (25Huibers P.D.T. Lobanov V.S. Katritzky A.R. Shah D.O. Karelson M. J. Colloid Interface Sci. 1997; 187: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Liposome and Mixed Micelle Preparations—Phosphatidylserine was dissolved in chloroform at 1 mm, dried under a stream of argon (10 min), and dried by vacuum desiccation (45 min). Dried samples were hydrated at 1 mm concentration in Assembly Buffer by bath sonication in a Parafilm sealed glass test tube for 3 h. Liposomes were prepared fresh for each experiment, and their presence was confirmed by electron microscopy. Mixed detergent micelles were prepared by mixing varying ratios of C14E8 and C20H41SO4Na at 2 mm total concentration followed by 30 min of sonication. Fibrillization reactions were performed as described above with 100 μm total final detergent concentration. Nomenclature—Polyoxyethylene detergents of formula CH3(CH2)y-O(CH2CH2) x-H are referred to as C(y+1)Ex, where y and x are the number of methylene and oxyethylene groups, respectively. Sodium alkyl sulfate and alkyl tetramethyl ammonium bromide detergents are referred to by their chemical formulas. Anionic but not Nonionic or Cationic Detergents Can Induce Tau Protein Assembly—The importance of alkyl chain length, head group charge, and CMC for induction of recombinant htau40 polymerization was examined for a selection of ionic and nonionic synthetic detergents. htau40 was used because of ease and yield of preparation and because the presence of the tag does not significantly change the rate or extent of AA-induced tau fibrillization (26King M.E. Gamblin T.C. Kuret J. Binder L.I. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1749-1757Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Nonionic detergents tested included the polyoxyethylenes Triton X-100 (data not shown), Tween 20, C8E4, C10E6, C10E8, C12E23, and C14E6. These had CMC values ranging from 10 to 600 μm when measured under standard tau assembly conditions in the presence or absence of htau40 (Table I). None of the nonionic detergents were capable of inducing tau fibrillization (using the transmission electron microscopy assay) when tested at concentrations up to 500 μm. In addition, tau protein had no observable effect on detergent micellization (Table I). These results suggest that uncharged surface active hydrophobic agents were insufficient to promote tau fibrillization when present in either dispersed or micellar form.Table IDetergent CMC values measured at 37 °CDetergentCMC-htau40+htau40aMeasured in the presence of 4 μM htau40.μMμMPolyoxyethelene nonionic detergentsC8E4586 ± 48NDbND, not determined.C10E6609 ± 33NDC10E8627 ± 120NDC12E2349.5 ± 18.652.2 ± 12.8Tween2024.7 ± 2.326.0 ± 3.1C14E811.3 ± 3.48.9 ± 1.8Quaternary ammonium cationic detergentsC15H34BrN7,600 ± 100NDC19H42BrN88.1 ± 3.438.9 ± 7.1C21H46BrN18.6 ± 4.519.5 ± 0.9Fatty acidsPalmitoleic acid996 ± 2687.3 ± 3.6Stearic acid393 ± 250.0 ± 17.1AA236 ± 128.1 ± 0.5a Measured in the presence of 4 μM htau40.b ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab Extending the analysis to cationic detergents C15H34BrN, C19H42BrN, and C21H46BrN revealed that they too were inactive as fibrillization inducers when assayed above or below their CMC, although the presence of tau protein modestly depressed the CMC for C19H42BrN (Table I). These data suggest that, like nonionic detergents, positively charged ionic detergents are incapable of inducing tau fibrillization in either dispersed or micellar form. In contrast to these results, AA, which shares chemical properties with anionic detergents, was a powerful inducer of tau fibrillization at 75 μm concentration (Fig. 1). To determine whether other negatively charged chemical groups could substitute for the carboxylic acid moiety found in AA, the analysis was extended to include synthetic alkyl sulfate and alkyl sulfonate detergents containing 12–20 saturated straight chain carbon atoms. Very few filaments of long length (≥500 nm; 1–4 filaments/grid) were observed in the electron microscope when using the 12- or the 14-carbon sulfate or sulfonate series detergents as inducers. In contrast, alkyl sulfate and sulfonate detergents containing 16, 18, and 20 carbons induced significant polymerization. C18H37SO4Na and C20H41SO4Na were the most active inducers among this series; therefore, they were used in the studies described below. They produced abundant straight filaments from recombinant htau40 that were morphologically similar to those induced by AA (Fig. 1). Moreover, the alkyl sulfate detergents were broadly similar to AA in potency, yielding biphasic dose-response curves with maximal filament mass yielded at concentrations between 50 and 150 μm (Fig. 2). Nonetheless, alkyl sulfate inducers differed quantitatively from AA in that they appeared to be weaker nucleating agents, producing a smaller number of filaments that achieved longer length (Fig. 1). This was apparent in filament length distributions, which remained exponential but skewed toward longer lengths when induced by alkyl sulfates (Fig. 3). For example, AA produced >10-fold more filaments than C20H41SO4Na that were on average >5-fold shorter in length. Overall, despite inducing far fewer filaments, the total mass of filaments formed from C20H41SO4Na was typically ≈75% of the mass induced by AA. These data suggest that AA and the alkyl sulfate detergents induce tau fibrillization by similar mechanisms and that the minimum structural features responsible for measurable inducer activity are an alkyl chain of at least 16 carbons in length and a negatively charged head group comprised of at least carboxylate, sulfate, or sulfonate moieties.Fig. 2Alkyl sulfates resemble AA in potency. Htau40 (4 μm) was incubated (3 h at 37 °C) in the presence of varying concentrations of AA (▪), C18H37SO4Na (•), or C20H41SO4Na (○) and then examined by transmission electron microscopy at ×22,000 magnification. Filaments from two negatives were measured, summed, and plotted as total filament length ± range.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 3Length distributions of AA and alkyl sulfate-induced tau filaments. Htau40 (4 μm) was incubated (3 h at 37 °C) in the presence of 75 μm AA (▪), C18H37SO4Na (•), and C20H41SO4Na (○) and then examined by transmission electron microscopy at ×8,000 magnification. The lengths of all filaments ≥ 50 nm in length were then measured from digitized images and plotted. Each data point represents the percentage of all analyzed filaments (totaling 1,580, 2,067, and 591 for AA, C18H37SO4Na, and C20H41SO4Na, respectively) that segregated into consecutive length intervals (100 nm bins), whereas each line represents the best fit of the data points to an exponential distribution. Although exponential distributions were observed for all inducers at 75 μm, C18H37SO4Na and C20H41SO4Na induced fewer filaments that grew to longer lengths as compared with AA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) AA-induced Tau Fibrillization Requires Micelle Formation— CMC values for AA and alkyl sulfate detergents were measured to determine whether micelles were important for tau fibrillization activity. Consistent with earlier observations (14Wilson D.M. Binder L.I. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 150: 2181-2195PubMed Google Scholar), the CMC for AA in Assembly Buffer alone was measured as 236 ± 12 μm, which was well above the concentration required for tau fibrillization. When CMC was measured in Assembly Buffer complete with htau40 at 4 μm, however, the CMC decreased to 8.1 ± 0.5 μm. Tau-mediated CMC depression was observed with other fatty acids as well (palmitoleic and stearic acids; Table I), indicating that the effect was not unique to AA and extended to both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. These data show that fatty acids aggregate to form micelles at a much lower concentration in the presence of htau40 than in its absence. CMC depression was apparent even at substoichiometric molar ratios of htau40 to fatty acid. These observations were extended to a series of alkyl sulfate detergents, which follow a log-linear relationship between CMC and alkyl chain length when analyzed in water (Fig. 4; Ref. 25Huibers P.D.T. Lobanov V.S. Katritzky A.R. Shah D.O. Karelson M. J. Colloid Interface Sci. 1997; 187: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The slope of this relationship is proportional to the free energy contribution of transferring methylene groups from solvent to micelles (25Huibers P.D.T. Lobanov V.S. Katritzky A.R. Shah D.O. Karelson M. J. Colloid Interface Sci. 1997; 187: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). When measured in the presence of Assembly Buffer (without tau), the relationship between log CMC and alkyl chain length remained linear but was depressed toward lower CMCs (Fig. 4) because of the presence of neutral electrolyte (100 mm NaCl) in the buffer (27Corrin M.L. Harkins W.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1947; 67: 683-688Crossref Scopus (390) Google Scholar). When measured in Assembly Buffer complete with htau40, however, CMC values were depressed still further, so that they were fully 2 orders of magnitude below the values observed in water alone (Fig. 4). Plots of log CMC versus alkyl chain length remained linear under these conditions, with slopes that were statistically indistinguishable (95% confidence interval) from those obtained in Assembly Buffer alone (Fig. 4), suggesting that the detergent aggregates formed in the presence of tau protein resembled authentic micelles with respect to their free energies of formation. These data show that tau protein exerted a profound effect on the micellization of anionic detergents and that anionic micelles were present under all assembly conditions that yielded tau filaments. The observation that tau fibrillization was initially proportional to increasing detergent or fatty acid concentration above their true CMCs (Fig. 2), where micelle but not monomer concentration was increasing (28Gunnarsson G. Jonsson B. Wennerstrom H. J. Phys. Chem. 1980; 84: 3114-3121Crossref Scopus (367) Google Scholar), suggests that tau fibrillization is proportional to the concentration of anionic detergent or fatty acid micelles. Minimum Requirements for Micelle-mediated Tau Fibrillization—To quantify the importance of negative charge for tau fibrillization, htau40 was incubated with mixed micelles prepared from nonionic detergent C14E8 and varying mol % concentrations of ionic inducer C20H41SO4Na. C14E8 was chosen as carrier because it was incapable of inducing tau fibrillization on its own and because, under assembly conditions, its had a low micromolar CMC, regardless of whether htau40 was present (Table I). Total detergent concentration was held constant at 100 μm to ensure the presence of micelles under all assay conditions, and resultant total filament mass was estimated by assaying tau protein in pellet and supernatant fractions after ultracentrifugation. Tau aggregation was not detectable below 20 mol % C20H41SO4Na but was observed at 40 mol % and increased above that concentration to 100 mol % C20H41SO4Na (Fig. 5). At that point, 39% of total tau protomer was rendered insoluble. Assuming a linear relationship between C20H41SO4Na content and tau filament formation and extrapolating to the ordinate intercept, tau fibrillization was supported under standard conditions when 100 μm mixed micelles contained 38.0 ± 6.4 mol % C20H41SO4Na. Phosphatidylserine Liposomes Induce Tau Polymerization—To determine whether anionic lipids could substitute for anionic detergents as inducers of tau fibrillization, htau40 was incubated (3 h at 37 °C) with 10–400 μm phosphatidylserine vesicles under standard conditions and subjected to electron microscopy assay. Unlike anionic micelles, phosphatidylserine vesicles were readily observable in electron microscopy assays because of their large size (typically >50 nm in diameter compared with <10 nm in diameter for detergents). Moreover, their CMCs in aqueous solution have been estimated in the nanomolar range (29King M.D. Marsh D. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1224-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), so that they were almost completely vesicular before incubation with tau protein. Examination of reaction products by electron microscopy showed the presence of vesicles and very long filaments at most phosphatidylserine concentrations tested. Closer inspection revealed that at least 15% of all filaments were associated with phospholipid vesicles through their ends, which appeared to extend from the vesicle surface (Fig. 6). Other vesicles were observed alone or associated with filaments along their length (Fig. 6). These data showed that anionic vesicle-forming lipids were capable of inducing tau filament formation and suggested that the mechanism involved facilitation of tau aggregation at the vesicle surface. AA-mediated Tau Fibrillization Follows a Ligand-facilitated Mechanism—To test this hypothesis, htau40 was subjected to fibrillization conditions for 3.5 h in the presence and absence of [14C]AA (75 μm), and the amount of labeled AA comigrating with filamentous tau was determined after centrifugation. Under these conditions, ∼50% of AA-treated htau40 comigrated with the pellet (filamentous) fraction, whereas most AA (>97%) remained in the soluble fraction (Table II). The pellet fraction contained 0.19 ± 0.05 mol AA/mol tau, confirming that AA remained at least partially associated with tau filaments but was not incorporated with 1:1 molar stoichiometry with respect to tau protomer. These data suggest that AA acted in micellar form to facilitate tau aggregation but did not directly mediate filament extension with concomitant incorporation into growing filaments.Table IIAssociation of [14C]AA with tau filaments after centrifugationSampleProteinaDetermined by Coomassie Blue binding assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data are reported as average ± S.D. of three independent experiments measured in duplicate.ProteinTauAAbDetermined using [14C] AA as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data are reported as average ± S.D. of two independent experiments measured in duplicate.Stoichiometryμg%nmolnmolmol AA/mol tauTotal218 ± 24100 ± 114.54 ± 0.48Pellet106 ± 649 ± 32.21 ± 0.240.41 ± 0.110.19 ± 0.05Supernatant115 ± 1253 ± 62.40 ± 0.2622.26 ± 0.349.28 ± 1.10a Determined by Coomassie Blue binding assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data are reported as average ± S.D. of three independent experiments measured in duplicate.b Determined using [14C] AA as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data are reported as average ± S.D. of two independent experiments measured in duplicate. Open table in a new tab Here we examined the mechanism of fatty acid-mediated tau fibrillization and showed that it stems from two structural features: (a) an alkyl chain of at least 12 carbons in length, and (b) a negatively charged head group. Although requirement of an alkyl chain has been reported previously (14Wilson D.M. Binder L.I. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 150: 2181-2195PubMed Google Scholar), its role has been confounding because all fatty acids examined to date have been active well below their CMCs, suggesting that alkyl chains were involved in binding tau protein rather than micellization. Published CMC values were determined in the absence of tau protein, however, and the surprising finding here is that the presence of even micromolar concentrations of tau protein greatly depressed the CMC for AA and other anionic detergents. Protein-mediated depression of alkyl sulfate CMC has been observed previously with micromolar concentrations of peptides derived from uteroglobin (30Tessari M. Foffani M.T. Mammi S. Peggion E.

Simultaneously, evidence is provided that increased oxidative stress might play a crucial role in the rapid progression of the Swedish FAD. Here we investigated the effect of the Swedish double mutation (K670M/N671L) in the β-amyloid precursor protein on oxidative stress-induced cell death mechanisms in PC12 cells. Western blot analysis and cleavage studies of caspase substrates revealed an elevated activity of the executor caspase 3 after treatment with hydrogen peroxide in cells containing the Swedish APP mutation. This elevated activity is the result of the enhanced activation of both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis pathways, including activation of caspase 2 and caspase 8. Furthermore, we observed an enhanced activation of JNK pathway and an attenuation of apoptosis by SP600125, a JNK inhibitor, through protection of mitochondrial dysfunction and reduction of caspase 9 activity. Our findings provide evidence that the massive neurodegeneration in early age of FAD patients could be a result of an increased vulnerability of neurons through activation of different apoptotic pathways as a consequence of elevated levels of oxidative stress.

Increased oxidative stress levels have been found in the temporal inferior cortex from Swedish FAD patients (28Bogdanovic N. Zilmer M. Zilmer K. Rehema A. Karelson E. Dement. Geriatr. Cogn.

Aβ is believed to play a major role in promoting neuronal degeneration and death by rendering neurons vulnerable to age-related increases in levels of oxidative stress and impairments in cellular energy metabolism (32Mattson M.P.

New evidence indicates that reactive oxygen species-induced cellular events implicate the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (36Suzaki Y. Yoshizumi M. Kagami S. Koyama A.H. Taketani Y.

Oxidative stress may cause the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK; also known as stress-activated protein kinase) in degenerating neurons in AD (38Zhu X. Raina A.K. Rottkamp C.A. Aliev G. Perry G. Boux H. Smith M.A. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 435-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). An involvement of JNK pathway by the induction of Fas ligand in Aβ-induced neuronal apoptosis was described by Morishima et al. (39Morishima Y. Gotoh Y. Zieg J. Barrett T. Takano H. Flavell R. Davis R.J. Shirasaki Y. Greenberg M.E. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7551-7560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of JNK and p38 associated with amyloid deposition was observed in mice transgenic for the human APPsw mutation (40Savage M.J. Lin Y.G. Ciallella J.R. Flood D.G. Scott R.W. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 3376-3385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The inhibition of the JNK pathway was proposed as a potential therapeutic target in AD (41Troy C.M. Rabacchi S.A. Xu Z. Maroney A.C. Connors T.J. Shelanski M.L. Greene L.A. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 157-164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Caspases can be divided into initiator caspases and effector caspases based on the presence of a large prodomain at their amino-terminal region. Initiator caspases containing a long prodomain, like caspase 2, caspase 8, caspase 9, and caspase 10 generally act in early stages of a proteolytic cascade, whereas effector caspases, like caspase 3, caspase 6, and caspase 7 act downstream and are involved in the cleavage of specific cellular proteins (for a review, see Refs. 42Earnshaw W.C. Martins L.M. Kaufmann S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 383-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (2451) Google Scholar and 43Yuan J. Yankner B.A. Nature. 2000; 407: 802-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1603) Google Scholar). Among the identified caspases, caspase 3 is of particular interest, since it appears to be very important in the progression of AD (12Eckert A. Steiner B. Marques C. Leutz S. Romig H. Haass C.

Here we report on the effects of FAD-related APP mutation, using stably transfected PC12 (rat pheochromocytoma) cells expressing the Swedish mutant APP, wild-type APP, or empty vector. We examined the effect of hydrogen peroxide on the activation of different caspases and the JNK pathway to elucidate the relationship between mutant APP expression, increased Aβ production, and neuronal cell death. Furthermore, we investigated the protective effects of caspase inhibitors as well as JNK inhibitor in preventing oxidative stress-mediated cell death. Materials—Phospho-JNK (Thr183/Tyr185) and phospho-c-Jun (Ser63) antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, and cytochrome c antibody was from BD Biosciences. Rat-specific caspase 3 and caspase 9 antibodies were also purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Caspase 2 antibody was purchased from Alexis. Caspase 8 antibody was from Biocat. The caspase substrates were purchased from Calbiochem (Ac-DEVD-para-nitroaniline (pNA), Ac-VEID-pNA, Ac-VDVAD-pNA, and Ac-IETD-pNA for caspase 3, caspase 6, caspase 2, and caspase 8, respectively). JNK inhibitor II (SP600125; anthrax(1,9-cd)pyrazol-6(2H)-one) was from Calbiochem. Cell Culture and Transfection—The generation and characterization of PC12 cell lines expressing human APPwt-, mutant APP (APPsw)-, and vector-transfected control clones have been described previously (12Eckert A. Steiner B. Marques C. Leutz S. Romig H. Haass C. Muller W.E. J. Neurosci. Res. 2001; 64: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In brief, PC12 cells were transfected with DNA constructs harboring human mutant (APPsw; K670M/N671L) or wild-type APP (APPwt) gene, inserted downstream of a cytomegalovirus promotor, using the FUGENE technique (Roche Applied Science). The transfected cell lines APPwt PC12, APPsw PC12, and vector-transfected PC12 were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 5% heat-inactivated horse serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 400 μg/ml G418 at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2. The stably transfected clones (APPwt M5, N10, and U7 and APPsw Q8 and Q9) were selected for the present study based on their similar expression of APP695 and the 5-fold increased secretion of Aβ-(1–40) in the APPsw clones (Fig. 1). To rule out potential influences on the APP expression levels, APPsw and APPwt clones were routinely screened in parallel to the experiments presented in this work. No alterations in the expression of APP were found. Detection of Aβ—For the detection of secreted Aβ-(1–40), we used a specific sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay employing monoclonal antibodies as described previously (50Steiner H. Capell A. Pesold B. Citron M. Kloetzel P.M. Selkoe D.J. Romig H. Mendla K. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32322-32331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Oxidative Stress-induced Cell Death—Cell death was induced with hydrogen peroxide (freshly prepared solution; 250 μm; Sigma). In respective experiments, caspase inhibitors were added 3 h before exposure to H2O2 (250 μm, 24 h) at a final concentration of 10 μm: caspase 3 inhibitor (AC-DEVD-CMK), caspase 6 inhibitor (VEID-CHO), caspase 8 inhibitor (IETD-CHO), and caspase 9 inhibitor (LEHD-CHO). Only cell-permeable caspase inhibitors were used. Measurement of Caspase Activity—PC12 cells were plated the day before at a density of 5 × 106 cells/culture dish (10 cm diameter). After treatment with H2O2, the cells were harvested, and after a centrifugation step, the culture medium was aspirated. The cell-containing pellet was washed with PBS and lysed in 100 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1% CHAPS, pH 7.4). Lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was used for caspase assay. The approximate protein amount of the probes was confirmed by a Lowry protein test. Caspase activity was measured by cleavage of colorimetric substrates (Ac-DEVD-pNA, Ac-VEID-pNA, Ac-VDVAD-pNA, Ac-IETD-pNA, and Ac-LEHD-pNA for caspase 3, caspase 6, caspase 2, caspase 8, and caspase 9, respectively). The production of pNA was monitored over 30 min in a photometer (λ = 405 nm). The caspase activity is expressed as change in absorption units. One unit was defined as the amount of enzyme required to cleave 1 pmol of NA per min of incubation per 5 × 106 cells. Quantification of Apoptosis by Flow Cytometry—Apoptosis was determined by propidium iodide (PI) staining and fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis as described previously (12Eckert A. Steiner B. Marques C. Leutz S. Romig H. Haass C. Muller W.E. J. Neurosci. Res. 2001; 64: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Briefly, H2O2-treated PC12 cells were lysed in buffer (0.1% sodium citrate and 0.1% Triton X-100) containing 50 μg/ml propidium iodide. Samples were analyzed by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur) using Cell Quest software (Becton Dickinson). Cells with a lower DNA content showing less propidium iodide staining than G1 have been defined as apoptotic cells (sub- G1 peak). Phospho-JNK Pathway Western Blot Analysis—PC12 cells were plated at a density of 5 × 106 cells/culture dish (10 cm diameter) and treated with H2O2. Cells were harvested and lysed in SDS sample buffer: Tris-HCl (62.5 mm, pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% bromphenol blue. After sonicating and boiling, proteins were separated by electrophoresis on a 16% polyacrylamide gel. The separated proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (ImmobilonTM-P; Millipore). These membranes were stained with Ponceau S red (reversible stain) to visualize the proteins. Nonspecific sites on the membranes were blocked with 5% fat-free milk in Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST). The phosphorylated JNK was visualized with the appropriate primary phosphoantibody, phospho-stress-activated protein kinase/JNK (Thr183/Tyr185), which detects stress-activated protein kinase/JNK only dually phosphorylated at Thr183/Tyr185. The phosphorylated c-Jun was detected by a phospho-c-Jun (Ser63) antibody. After thorough washing with TBST, membranes were covered with ECL™ detection reagents and quickly exposed to an autoradiography film. Membranes were routinely stripped for actin control. Caspase Immunoblot Analysis—PC12 cells were plated at a density of 5 × 106 cells/culture dish (10 cm diameter) and treated with H2O2. After the indicated periods of time, the medium was aspirated, and cells were processed for Western blotting with rat-specific cleaved caspase 3, caspase 8, and caspase 9 antibodies. Blots were scanned (Umax Astra 4000 U), and the band intensity was determined after background subtraction using densitometric analysis. Determination of Cytochrome c Release—The amount of cytochrome c released from the mitochondrial intermembrane space into the cytosol was determined by digitonin permeabilization (51Gottlieb R.A. Granville D.J. Methods. 2002; 26: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 × 106 cells were exposed to oxidative stress for different periods of time. After washing with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, cells were resuspended in permeabilization buffer containing 75 mm NaCl, 1 mm NaH2PO4, 8 mm Na2PO4, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, additional protease inhibitors, and 0.05% digitonin. Following a centrifugation step at 800 × g at 4 °C for 10 min, the supernatant was separated from the pellet consisting of mitochondria and cellular debris. The supernatant containing cytoplasmic proteins was purified by centrifugation at 13,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. Equal amounts of protein (10 μg) were loaded on an 18% acrylamide gel and separated by SDS-PAGE. After immunoblotting with a monoclonal cytochrome c antibody, polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were stripped and reprobed either for COX4 or actin, ensuring equal protein loading and the absence of mitochondrial contamination. Determination of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential—PC12 cells were plated the day before at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well in a 24-well plate. The cells were pretreated for 1 h with the JNK inhibitor SP600125, and H2O2 was added for 6 h. The membrane potential of the inner mitochondrial membrane was measured using the dye rhodamine 123. The dye was added to the cell culture medium at a concentration of 0.4 μm for 15 min. The cells were washed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution, and the fluorescence was determined with a fluorescence reader (Victor Multilabel counter; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Transmembrane distribution of the dye depends on the mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm). Statistical Analysis—Data are given as mean ± S.E. For statistical comparison, paired t test, Student's t test, or one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post hoc test or two-way ANOVA were used. p values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Generation and Characterization of PC12 Cell Lines Overexpressing APPwt and APPsw—To investigate the effects of APP overexpression in oxidative stress-induced apoptosis, we used several clones of PC12 cells stably transfected with APP cDNAs. Similar expression of human APP in the investigated cell lines was confirmed by Western blotting. As expected, the human-specific antibody does not recognize any APP species in vector-transfected PC12 cells (Fig. 1A), whereas equal expression levels of human APP were detected in clones of APPwt cells and in clones of cells containing the Swedish mutation. Culture supernatants of the APP-transfected cells were also analyzed for Aβ-(1–40) production revealing 4–5-fold elevated Aβ-(1–40) levels in clones of APPsw cells compared with clones of APPwt cells (Fig. 1B). APPsw Mutation Leads to an Enhanced Vulnerability to Oxidative Stress-induced Apoptosis—We induced apoptosis in transfected PC12 cells using the oxidative stressor hydrogen peroxide. Nuclear DNA fragmentation was quantitatively detected by propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry. Very importantly, clones bearing the APPsw mutation are sensitized to an exposure to oxidative stress for 24 h in a concentration-dependent manner with a maximum increase of apoptotic cells at a concentration of 500 μm H2O2 (12Eckert A. Steiner B. Marques C. Leutz S. Romig H. Haass C. Muller W.E. J. Neurosci. Res. 2001; 64: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Treatment with H2O2 led to a significantly enhanced maximum increase of apoptotic cells in APPsw-bearing PC12 cells (51.4 ± 5.3%) compared with APPwt-bearing cells (28.4 ± 4.7%) and vector control cells (21.3% ± 4.3%). Different clones with the same transfectant behave similarly in their sensitivity to H2O2-induced cell death (Fig. 1C). Oxidative Stress Induces Activation of Caspase 2 in PC12 Cells—Oxidative stress in the human brain has been implicated as one major cause of neuronal cell loss in AD patients. However, the exact mechanism still remains unknown. Aβ appears to bind redox-active metals like zinc, copper, or iron with high affinity, resulting in production of hydrogen peroxide and autoxidation of the metallopeptide complex (52Rottkamp C.A. Raina A.K. Zhu X. Gaier E. Bush A.I. Atwood C.S. Chevion M. Perry G. Smith M.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 53Tabner B.J. Turnbull S. El Agnaf O.M. Allsop D. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 1076-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The signaling cascades activated following the oxidative stress have not been widely studied. Therefore, we studied the implication of caspase 2 by measuring the activity and by Western blotting. Cleavage of the photometric substrate Ac-VDVAD-p-nitroanilide by cytosolic protein extracts indicates the presence of caspase 2 protease activity in the cultures after exposure to hydrogen peroxide. The activity was already induced early in APPsw cells within 2 h of induction (Fig. 2A). Caspase 2 activity was continuously elevated over time compared with APPwt and vector-transfected cells. Maximum caspase 2 activity was measured after 2 h, with a 4-fold higher activity in APPsw cells than in APPwt and vector PC12 cells, respectively (Fig. 2B). The mechanism of activation of caspases occurs by a sequential cleavage of the zymogen to release the large and the small cleavage products. In accordance with our findings from the determination of activity, Western blotting confirmed cleavage of caspase 2 within 2 h of hydrogen peroxide induction (Fig. 2C). Again, the activation of caspase 2 was noticeably higher in APPsw cells compared with vector-transfected controls. Involvement of Caspase 8 —Apoptosis associated with the Fas/tumor necrosis factor receptor family of death receptors requires caspase 8 activity and adaptor proteins such as FADD. The involvement of caspase 8 in processing of APP during apoptosis by caspase 8 has been reported recently (46Pellegrini L. Passer B.J. Tabaton M. Ganjei J.K. D'Adamio L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21011-21016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The blocking of neuronal death by caspase 8 inhibitor IETD-fmk in Aβ-induced cell death was also demonstrated (54Ivins K.J. Thornton P.L. Rohn T.T. Cotman C.W. Neurobiol. Dis. 1999; 6: 440-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Hence, we examined the activation of caspase 8 in our transfected cell lines overexpressing intracellular high levels of Aβ in order to ascertain the involvement of this initiator caspase in oxidative stress. We utilized Ac-IETD-pNA to measure caspase 8 activity in lysates of treated cells. In parallel to the early activation of caspase 2, caspase 8 activity increased about 3-fold after 2 h of stress induction in PC12 cells expressing the Swedish double mutation and was significantly enhanced in a time-dependent manner compared with vector transfected controls (Fig. 3, A and B). Activation of caspase 8 involves a two-step proteolysis: the cleavage of the procaspase 8 to g"
https://openalex.org/W2087956834,"The ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8 is essential for activity of SCF-like ubiquitin ligase complexes. Here we identify and characterize NEDP1, a human NEDD8-specific protease. NEDP1 is highly conserved throughout evolution and equivalent proteins are present in yeast, plants, insects, and mammals. Bacterially expressed NEDP1 is capable of processing NEDD8 in vitro to expose the diglycine motif required for conjugation and can deconjugate NEDD8 from modified substrates. NEDP1 appears to be specific for NEDD8 as neither ubiquitin nor SUMO bearing COOH-terminal extensions are utilized as substrates. Inhibition studies and mutagenesis indicate that NEDP1 is a cysteine protease with sequence similarities to SUMO-specific proteases and the class of viral proteases typified by the adenovirus protease. In vivo NEDP1 deconjugates NEDD8 from a wide variety of substrates including the cullin component of SCF-like complexes. Thus NEDP1 is likely to play an important role in ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis by controlling the activity of SCF complexes."
https://openalex.org/W2170279469,"This study evaluates the feasibility of producing a composite engineered tracheal equivalent composed of cylindrical cartilaginous structures with lumens lined with nasal epithelial cells. Chondrocytes and epithelial cells isolated from sheep nasal septum were cultured in Ham's F12 media. After 2 wk, chondrocyte suspensions were seeded onto a matrix of polyglycolic acid. Cell-polymer constructs were wrapped around silicon tubes and cultured in vitro for 1 wk, followed by implanting into subcutaneous pockets on the backs of nude mice. After 6 wk, epithelial cells were suspended in a hydrogel and injected into the embedded cartilaginous cylinders following removal of the silicon tube. Implants were harvested 4 wk later and analyzed. The morphology of implants resembles that of native sheep trachea. H&E staining shows the presence of mature cartilage and formation of a pseudo-stratified columnar epithelium, with a distinct interface between tissue-engineered cartilage and epithelium. Safranin-O staining shows that tissue-engineered cartilage is organized into lobules with round, angular lacunae, each containing a single chondrocyte. Proteoglycan and hydroxyproline contents are similar to native cartilage. This study demonstrates the feasibility of recreating the cartilage and epithelial portion of the trachea using tissue harvested in a single procedure. This has the potential to facilitate an autologous repair of segmental tracheal defects."
https://openalex.org/W1980106300,"Transthyretin Leu55Pro is one of the most aggressive mutations in familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy, an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by extracellular deposition of fibrillar amyloid protein. This variant has the ability to form fibrils in vitro under physiological conditions (PBS, pH 7.4). We studied by transmission electron microscopy the effect of the drug 4'-iodo-4'-deoxydoxorubicin (I-DOX) on the in vitro assembly of TTR Leu55Pro fibrils by following fibril growth over a 15 day period. Our results showed that I-DOX at a concentration of 10-5 M/100 microg fibrils does not inhibit fibril formation in up to 10 days since fibrils identical to the ones present in the untreated sample were observed. However, after 15 days of treatment, only round particles, resembling soluble native TTR, were observed. We also tested the ability of tetracyclines and nitrophenols to interfere with amyloid fibril formation for 17 days; the group of compounds tested showed fibril disruption activity to different extents: doxycycline and 2,4-dinitrophenol resulted in complete disaggregation of fibrils. The species generated upon I-DOX and tetracyclines treatments were nontoxic, as revealed by the lack of significant caspase-3 activation on a Schwannoma cell line, making them potential therapeutic drugs in TTR-related and other amyloidosis."
https://openalex.org/W1974841034,"Plasma membrane-associated sialidase is a key enzyme for ganglioside hydrolysis, thereby playing crucial roles in regulation of cell surface functions. Here we demonstrate that mice overexpressing the human ortholog (NEU3) develop diabetic phenotype by 18–22 weeks associated with hyperinsulinemia, islet hyperplasia, and increased β-cell mass. As compared with the wild type, insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of the insulin receptor (IR) and insulin receptor substrate I was significantly reduced, and activities of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and glycogen synthase were low in transgenic muscle. IR phosphorylation was already attenuated in the younger mice before manifestation of hyperglycemia. Transient transfection of NEU3 into 3T3-L1 adipocytes and L6 myocytes caused a significant decrease in IR signaling. In response to insulin, NEU3 was found to undergo tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequent association with the Grb2 protein, thus being activated and causing negative regulation of insulin signaling. In fact, accumulation of GM1 and GM2, the possible sialidase products in transgenic tissues, caused inhibition of IR phosphorylation in vitro, and blocking of association with Grb2 resulted in reversion of impaired insulin signaling in L6 cells. The data indicate that NEU3 indeed participates in the control of insulin signaling, probably via modulation of gangliosides and interaction with Grb2, and that the mice can serve as a valuable model for human insulin-resistant diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2003989385,"Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has potential for the treatment of human neurodegenerative diseases. However, the general lack of success of neurotrophic factors in clinical trials has led to the suggestion that low molecular weight neurotrophic drugs may be better agents for therapeutic use. Here we describe small, dimeric peptides designed to mimic a pair of solvent-exposed loops important for the binding and activation of the BDNF receptor, trkB. The monomer components that make up the dimers were based on a monocyclic monomeric peptide mimic of a single loop of BDNF (loop 2) that we had previously shown to be an inhibitor of BDNF-mediated neuronal survival (O'Leary, P. D., and Hughes, R. A. (1998) J. Neurochem. 70, 1712–1721). Bicyclic dimeric peptides behaved as partial agonists with respect to BDNF, promoting the survival of embryonic chick sensory neurons in culture. We reasoned that the potency and/or efficacy of these compounds might be improved by reducing the conformational flexibility about their dimerizing linker. Thus, we designed a highly conformationally constrained tricyclic dimeric peptide and synthesized it using an efficient, quasi-one-pot approach. Although still a partial BDNF-like agonist, the tricyclic dimer was particularly potent in promoting neuronal survival in vitro (EC50 11 pm). The peptides described here, which are greatly reduced in size compared with the parent protein, could serve as useful lead compounds for the development of true neurotrophic drugs and indicate that the structure-based design approach could be used to obtain potent mimetics of other growth factors that dimerize their receptors.

Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1999; 9: 616-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In addition to its critical role in helping shape the vertebrate nervous system during development, BDNF is of particular therapeutic interest because of its neurotrophic actions on neuronal populations involved in several neurodegenerative diseases (2Froestl W. Pharm. Acta Helv. 2000; 74: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), including: sensory neurons, implicated in peripheral sensory neuropathies (3Lindsay R.M. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1996; 351: 365-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar); motor neurons, which degenerate in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (4Askansas V. Adv. Neurol. 1995; 68: 241-244PubMed Google Scholar); dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra, lost in Parkinson's disease; and cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain, involved in Alzheimer's disease (5Siegel G.J. Chauhan N.B. Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 2000; 33: 199-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). BDNF, like the other neurotrophins, produces its effects on neurons through two transmembrane receptors. Binding of a neurotrophin to a specific member of the trk family of receptor tyrosine kinases (NGF binds to trkA, BDNF and NT-4/5 bind to trkB, and NT-3 preferentially binds to trkC) results in the step-wise homodimerization of the receptor, leading to receptor autophosphorylation and the initiation of multiple signal transduction pathways, including those leading to neuronal survival (6Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 381-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (1644) Google Scholar). In contrast, the glycoprotein p75 acts as a common low-affinity receptor (K D ≈ 10–9m) for all the neurotrophins (7Chao M.V. J. Neurobiol. 1994; 25: 1373-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Unlike the trk family, p75 signals apoptosis via a unique intracellular death domain, Chopper (8Coulson E.J. Reid K. Baca M. Shipham K.A. Hulett S.M. Kilpatrick T.J. Bartlett P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30537-30545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), although its precise biological function remains controversial. The high affinity binding sites for BDNF and the other neurotrophins on neurons (K D ≈ 10–11m) probably consist of a combination of the appropriate trk member and p75. The overall response to a neurotrophin therefore depends on the balance of signaling through a trk family member and p75, with the opportunity for modulation and cross-talk at multiple levels of the signaling process. The neurotrophins are homodimers consisting of two monomers, each of ∼120 residues. X-ray crystal structures of NGF (9McDonald N.Q. Lapatto R. Murray-Rust J. Gunning J. Wlodawer A. Blundell T.L. Nature. 1991; 354: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar), NT-3 (10Butte M.J. Hwang P.K. Mobley W.C. Fletterick R.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16846-16852Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), NT-4/5, and a BDNF/NT-4/5 heterodimer (11Robinson R.C. Radziejewski C. Spraggon G. Greenwald J. Kostura M.R. Burtnick L.D. Stuart D.I. Choe S. Jones E.Y. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2589-2597Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) reveal a common fold for the neurotrophins. Each monomer consists of seven β-strands (contributing to three longitudinal antiparallel β-sheets) connected by three solvent-exposed hairpin loops (loops 1, 2, and 4) and a longer loop (loop 3) and contains three disulfide bridges between six fully conserved cysteine residues arranged in a cystine-knot motif, characteristic of this growth factor superfamily. However, in contrast to most of the other members of the superfamily, the neurotrophin monomers are arranged in the dimer in a parallel fashion, and are held together solely by non-covalent (largely hydrophobic) interactions. A number of studies implicate the solvent-exposed loops of BDNF and the other neurotrophins in mediating their biological effects. Site-directed mutagenesis analyses have revealed that the ability to bind and activate trkB can be conferred to NGF by replacing residues in loop 2 with the corresponding residues from BDNF (12Ibáñez C.F. Ilag L.L. Murray-Rust J. Persson H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2281-2293Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of NGF in complex with one of the Ig domains of trkA shows direct contact between residues in the receptor and loop 1 of NGF (13Wiesmann C. Ultsch M.H. Bass S.H. de Vos A.M. Nature. 1999; 401: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), although the authors of this article have since conceded that additional regions of the neurotrophins may well interact with other trk domains (14Wiesmann C. de Vos A.M. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 748-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In support of the functional role for loop 2, we have reported that conformationally constrained peptides (of which the monocyclic monomeric peptide 1 (Table I) was identified as the most effective) designed to mimic a single loop 2 of BDNF are inhibitors of BDNF-mediated survival of sensory neurons in culture, probably by acting as competitive trkB antagonists (15O'Leary P.D. Hughes R.A. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 1712-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).Table IStructures, mass spectral data, and summary of in vitro neuronal survival effect of compounds described in this study Despite promising preclinical data, clinical trials with recombinant BDNF in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis have proven unsuccessful (16BDNF Study Group: Phase III Neurology. 1999; 52: 1427-1433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This failure is likely to have been caused, at least in part, by the unfavorable pharmacokinetics of BDNF; for example, the plasma half-life of recombinant BDNF in rats is less than 1 min (17Poduslo J.F. Curran G.L. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 36: 280-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). These and similar data from other neurotrophic factors have led to the view that low molecular weight drugs, with more appropriate pharmacokinetic properties than the parent proteins, might prove a more fruitful means of harnessing neurotrophic action for therapeutic use (18Skaper S.D. Walsh F.S. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1998; 12: 179-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). As a step toward the development of such neurotrophic drugs, we describe here a structure-based approach for the discovery of potent mimetics of BDNF. Given our previous data with monocyclic monomeric BDNF inhibitors (15O'Leary P.D. Hughes R.A. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 1712-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), we reasoned that appropriately designed dimeric loop 2 mimetics should be able to bring about trkB homodimerization and thus mimic the actions of BDNF through this receptor. Using this approach, three classes of peptides were designed and synthesized: bicyclic dimeric peptides linked by a disulfide bridge internal to the sequence of monomeric monocyclic peptide 1; a bicyclic dimer linked by an amide bond external to the peptide 1 sequence; and a highly constrained tricyclic dimeric peptide containing both disulfide and amide dimerizing linkages. The latter compound exhibited extremely high potency, comparable with BDNF, in promoting the survival of chick sensory neurons in culture. The results suggest that this compound is worthy of further preclinical development and that our structure-based approach may be of general utility in developing potent mimetics of other growth factors and cytokines that dimerize their receptors. Molecular Modeling—Bicyclic dimeric peptides were designed using Sybyl molecular modeling software (version 6.4; Tripos, St. Louis, MO) running on an O2 work station (SGI, Mountain View, CA). The loop 2 region from a model of the BDNF dimer (prepared by homology modeling (15O'Leary P.D. Hughes R.A. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 1712-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar)), corresponding to two copies of the sequence Glu40-Lys41-Val42-Pro43-Val44-Ser45-Lys46-Gly47-Gln48-Leu49-Lys50-Gln51 was inspected visually to identify positions where the loops were near one another. Distances between pairs of α-carbon atoms were then used to guide the selection of dimerizing linkages between the loops, which were incorporated as appropriate. A cyclizing disulfide bond was introduced into each of the newly linked loops at Lys41 and Lys50 as described previously (15O'Leary P.D. Hughes R.A. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 1712-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The residues beyond the terminal residues were deleted, either the zwitterions formed or the termini blocked, and the energy of each compound minimized. The resulting low energy conformation of each bicyclic dimeric peptide was superimposed onto the native BDNF loop 2 region and the degree of fit was quantified as the root mean square (r.m.s.) deviation of the distances between common α-carbon atoms. Assembly, Cleavage, and Cyclization of Monomeric Precursors—Linear peptide precursors were synthesized manually (0.1 mmol scale) from fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl-protected amino acids using standard solid-phase synthesis methods, with the following points of note: peptides for the synthesis of bicyclic disulfide-linked dimers 2–4 were assembled on chlorotrityl resin, preloaded with Cys. Cys residues involved in cyclization were trityl protected; the Cys residue needed for the dimerizing linkage was acetamidomethyl (Acm)-protected. Peptides required for the preparation of the bicyclic amide-linked dimer 5 and tricyclic dimer 6 were synthesized on Rink amide 4-methylbenzhydrylamine resin, which upon cleavage yields the peptide amide. The C-terminal Glu and Lys residues were incorporated as trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)-labile O-t-butyl- and t-butyloxycarbonyl-protected derivatives. To improve reaction efficiency, the resins were combined after coupling of Glu(O-t-butyl) and Lys(t-butyloxycarbonyl) residues, and subsequent assembly, cleavage, and purification steps were carried out on the mixture. Ser and the additional Lys residue were incorporated as the TFA-stable benzyloxycarbonyl (Z) and benzyl (Bzl) derivatives. For the tricyclic dimer 6, the Cys residue required for the third cycle was incorporated as the Acm derivative. The N termini of peptides 5 and 6 were acetylated before cleavage. To reduce the likelihood of racemization, the N-terminal Cys residue was coupled to all peptides as the preformed symmetrical anhydride (19Atherton E. Sheppard R.C. Ward P. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I. 1985; : 2065-2073Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). All peptides were cleaved from the resin with TFA/ethanedithiol/H2O (18:1:1). The crude partially protected linear peptides were oxidized to the corresponding partially protected monocyclic monomers by oxidizing the peptide (1 mg/ml) in a solution of dimethyl sulfoxide (10%) in 0.1 m aqueous NH4HCO3, pH 8 (20Tam J.P. Wu C.R. Liu W. Zhang J.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 6657-66622Crossref Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Synthesis of Bicyclic Disulfide-linked Dimers—Bicyclic disulfide-linked dimers 2–4 were prepared using a modification of the method of Kamber et al. (21Kamber B. Hartmann A. Eisler K. Riniker B. Rink H. Sieber P. Rittel W. Helv. Chim. Acta. 1980; 63: 899-915Crossref Scopus (249) Google Scholar) by dissolving the appropriate Acm-protected monocyclic monomeric peptide (8 μmol) in aqueous acetic acid (40 μl, 50%) containing HCl (10 μl, 1 m), adding I2 (400 μl, 50 mm in 50% acetic acid) and stirring the mixture at room temperature under N2. Upon completion (typically 6 h), the reaction mixture was quenched with ascorbic acid (10 μl, 1 m), and the desired bicyclic disulfide-linked dimer was purified by HPLC. Synthesis of Partially Protected Bicyclic Amide-linked Dimer—The Bzl/Z-protected bicyclic amide-linked dimer was prepared by dissolving the two Bzl/Z-protected monocyclic monomers (6 μmol each) in dimethylformamide (500 μl) before the addition of O-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (6.6 μmol) and diisopropylethylamine (9.9 μmol) and stirring. Upon completion (∼6 h), the reaction was diluted 20-fold with 10% acetonitrile, and the desired Bzl/Z-protected bicyclic amide-linked dimer was purified by HPLC. Synthesis of Partially Protected Tricyclic Dimer—The Z-protected tricyclic dimer was prepared using a combination of the dimerization methods described for disulfide- and amide-linked dimers above. Firstly, the two Acm/Z-protected monocyclic monomers (6 μmol each) were coupled in the presence of O-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate/diisopropylethylamine. The resultant Acm/Z-protected bicyclic dimer (2.8 μmol) was converted to the Z-protected tricyclic dimer by treatment with I2. HF Cleavage—Remaining Bzl and Z protecting groups were removed from partially protected bicyclic amide-linked dimer and partially protected tricyclic dimer by treating the crude peptides with HF in the presence of m-cresol (10:1) using standard methods. Purification and Characterization of Peptides—General reaction progress was monitored and peptides purified as appropriate by HPLC using UV detection (220 nm) on analytical (150 × 2.1 mm) or semi-preparative (250 × 10 mm) C18 columns. All final peptides were eluted as single peaks after purification. Identity of all peptide intermediates and final products was confirmed by mass spectrometry, using a Micromass platform II triple quadrupole mass spectrometer with an electrospray source (carried out at the Victorian College of Pharmacy, Monash University, Australia). All peptides (intermediates and final products) gave molecular ions with a mass-to-charge ratio within 0.1% of calculated values. Sensory Neuron Cultures—Peptides were assayed in primary cultures of dorsal root ganglion sensory neurons prepared from 8-day-old embryonic chicks as described previously (15O'Leary P.D. Hughes R.A. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 1712-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Peptides (1 × 10–11 to 10–4m) were added to cells in triplicate wells 1 h after plating either alone (concentration-response studies) or with mouse recombinant BDNF (4 × 10–11m; competition studies). Positive control wells contained BDNF only; negative control wells contained neither BDNF nor peptide. Initial viable neuron numbers were determined by counting phase-bright cell bodies in 40 microscope fields (0.25 × 0.25 mm, at 200× magnification) in four randomly chosen wells. After 48 h of incubation, surviving neurons (phase-bright cells with neurites) were counted. Data Analysis—Cell counts for individual experiments were normalized by setting neuronal survival in the BDNF-only positive controls (typically 35–40% of the initial number of viable neurons plated) to 100%, and survival in negative controls (typically 4–6%) to 0%. Neuronal survival was expressed as the mean ± S.E. from four or five different preparations. pEC50 and pIC50 values were estimated from logistical sigmoidal curves fit to concentration-response data. Neuronal survival in the presence of peptides was compared with negative controls (concentration-response studies) or positive controls (competition studies) by analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni's multiple comparisons test. Design of Bicyclic Dimeric Peptides—Examination of the loop 2 region of a model of the three-dimensional structure of the BDNF homodimer (Fig. 1A) revealed two sites in relatively close proximity: site 1 (Pro43-Pro43, Val44-Val44, Ser45-Ser45), located within sequence of the monocyclic monomeric peptide 1, and site 2 (Gln51-Gln51, Tyr52-Tyr52, Phe53-Phe53), located beyond the sequence of peptide 1 (Fig. 1B). The distance between α-carbon atoms of Val44-Val44 and Ser45-Ser45 fell within the maximal preferred distance of Cys-to-Cys constraint (6.6 Å as determined by conformational analyses). Incorporation of a Cys-to-Cys dimerizing linkage at these two positions yielded the bicyclic dimers 3 and 4 (Table I), which displayed relatively low r.m.s. deviation values (1.5 and 1.4 Å) when superimposed onto the native loop 2 conformation. The distance between the α-carbon atoms of the Pro43-Pro43 (11.3 Å) suggested that longer constraints might be more suitable at this position. However, incorporation of Glu-to-Lys or bridged Cys-to-Cys constraints (e.g. Cys-to-(CH2)5-to-Cys) yielded peptides that mapped poorly onto the native BDNF conformation (r.m.s. deviations of 3.1 and 2.3 Å), whereas the shorter Cys-to-Cys constraint (peptide 2; r.m.s. 1.2 Å) was in fact well tolerated, presumably because of favorable local conformation preferences. In site 2, only Gln51-Gln51, situated adjacent to the C-terminal of the monocyclic monomer 1, was investigated as a location for a dimerizing linkage, because the other sites (Tyr52-Tyr52 and Phe53-Phe53) were expected to give rise to peptides with inappropriate flexibility. Of the constraints examined in this position, the shorter Glu-to-Lys linkage (peptide 5; r.m.s. 1.7 Å) was better suited to this position than longer constraints (e.g. Cys-(CH2)7-Cys, r.m.s. 3.1 Å). Synthesis of Bicyclic Dimeric Peptides—The bicyclic dimers 2–5 were prepared using appropriate orthogonal side-chain protection strategies, to allow the selective formation of cyclizing (i.e. disulfide) and dimerizing (i.e. disulfide or amide) constraints. The disulfide-linked dimers 2–4 were synthesized using TFA-labile trityl protection for Cys required for the formation intramolecular disulfide bonds and TFA-stable Acmprotection for Cys involved in the dimerizing disulfide bridges. The success of the iodine-mediated removal of Acm and subsequent oxidation to the dimer was found to be dependent on the nature of the iodine scavenger used; best results were obtained after quenching with ascorbic acid solution. Use of other scavengers (e.g. sodium thiosulfate) resulted in multiple reaction products. The amide-linked dimer 5 was synthesized using a combination of tertiarybutyl-(i.e. TFA labile) and benzyl-(i.e. TFA stable) derived protection. After cyclization of the N- and C-terminally protected monomers, dimerization was effected with the amide bond forming reagent O-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate. Other condensation agents and conditions gave rise to multiple and/or incorrect products. The final step in the synthesis of 5 was the removal of the remaining benzyl-derived protecting groups on Ser and Lys by treatment with HF. Mass spectral data relating to the bicyclic dimers 2–5 can be found in Table I. Effects of Bicyclic Dimeric Peptides on Sensory Neuron Survival in Vitro—The effects of the bicyclic dimers 2–5 on neuronal survival were assessed in primary cultures of embryonic chick dorsal root ganglion sensory neurons, an assay used routinely in the literature to characterize the survival effects of BDNF and the other neurotrophins. When added alone to primary cultures of embryonic chick sensory neurons, the bicyclic disulfide-linked dimeric peptides 2 and 4, and the bicyclic amide-linked dimeric peptide 5 produced significant and concentration-dependent increases in neuronal survival (Fig. 2A). Although peptides 2, 4, and 5 gave a similar maximal survival effect (around 30% of the maximal survival effect of BDNF), peptide 5 was clearly the most potent of the bicyclic dimers (pEC50 of 10.0 ± 0.15), being more than 100-fold more potent than either 2 or 4. For peptides 2, 4, and 5, the survival effect dropped after reaching a maximum, giving their concentration-response curves a distinct bell-shape. In contrast to the survival promoting effects of 2, 4, and 5, neither the bicyclic disulfide-linked dimer 3 (Fig. 2A) nor the monocyclic monomeric precursors to the bicyclic dimers (data not shown) significantly promoted neuronal survival compared with negative controls over the concentration range tested. To assess the possible partial agonist behavior of the bicyclic dimeric peptides, the bicyclic disulfide-linked dimeric peptide 4 was added to chick sensory neuron cultures in competition with BDNF. Similar to its loop 2-based monocyclic monomeric counterpart 1 (15O'Leary P.D. Hughes R.A. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 1712-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), dimeric bicyclic peptide 4 caused significant and concentration-dependent inhibition of BDNF-mediated neuronal survival (Fig. 2B; maximal inhibition of 49% ± 7 at 1 × 10–7m; pIC50 of 9.43 ± 0.25). Together, these data suggest that bicyclic disulfide-linked dimer 4 acts as a partial agonist on the majority of neurons that respond to BDNF, rather than being a full agonist on a subset (30–35%) of BDNF responsive neurons. Design of Tricyclic Dimeric Peptides—We reasoned that the relatively low potency and partial agonist activity of the bicyclic dimers 2–5 may be caused, at least in part, by conformational flexibility about the dimerizing linkages, meaning that the two monomeric units within the peptides are likely to be capable of 360° rotation relative to one another (Fig. 3). The bicyclic dimers would probably behave as trkB agonists only when they existed in a conformation able to cause the in-plane dimerization of trkB (i.e. in a roughly parallel conformation). When the relative orientation of the two monomeric units is not favorable to receptor homodimerization (e.g. when the units are antiparallel), the bicyclic dimers would probably behave as antagonists, leading to a reduction in maximum, decrease in slope and rightward shift of the concentration-response curve, as previously shown for monocyclic monomeric peptides acting as competitive trkB antagonists (15O'Leary P.D. Hughes R.A. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 1712-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To explore this hypothesis and to attempt to obtain a BDNF mimetic with greater potency and efficacy, we designed tricyclic dimeric peptides (effectively, hybrids of the disulfide-linked and amide-linked dimers) in which two monocyclic, monomeric loop 2 units were linked by both an amide and a disulfide linkage (Fig. 3). Molecular dynamics simulations of these peptides showed that they possessed greatly reduced conformational freedom compared with their bicyclic counterparts, resulting in significantly greater similarity to the native loop 2 region of BDNF (data not shown). One of these tricyclic peptides, 6, was chosen for synthesis. Synthesis of Tricyclic Dimeric Peptide—The challenging synthesis of the tricyclic dimeric peptide 6 was approached using a combination of the strategies used to synthesize the bicyclic disulfide- and amide-linked dimers, allowing complete control to be exercised over the formation of the multiple cyclizing and dimerizing linkages (Fig. 4). Using this approach, the two linear precursors to peptide 6 were assembled (Fig. 4a), cleaved from the resin and partially deprotected (Fig. 4b) and cyclized (Fig. 4c), and the cyclic monomers dimerized (Fig. 4d) as described for the bicyclic amide-linked dimer 5. The third cycle was then introduced by treating the bicyclic peptide with iodine (Fig. 4e), bringing about the step-wise removal of the Acmprotected Cys residues and the subsequent oxidation of the free thiols to the disulfide, as described for bicyclic disulfide-linked dimers 2–4. Treatment of the partially protected tricyclic dimer with HF (Fig. 4f) yielded the crude desired tricylic dimeric peptide 6, which was readily purifiable by HPLC. To maximize the efficiency of this synthetic approach, we carried out steps a to d (Fig. 4) on the mixture of the two peptide building blocks. To do this, the two portions of resin, one preloaded with fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl-Glu(O-t-butyl), the other with fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl-Lys(t-butyloxycarbonyl), were combined, and the subsequent peptide elongation reactions carried out on the resin mixture. The linear protected peptides were cleaved, cyclized, and dimerized as a mixture, halving the number both of the reactions and chromatographic purifications. The remaining steps (Fig. 4, e and f) proceeded as described above yielding a product identical to that obtained after synthesis of discrete compounds. Using this optimized, quasi-one-pot approach, it is possible to prepare purified tricyclic dimeric peptide 6 from scratch in under a week. Effects of Tricyclic Dimer on Sensory Neuron Survival— When added alone to primary cultures of embryonic chick sensory neurons, the tricyclic dimeric peptide 6 produced significant and concentration-dependent increases in neuronal survival (Fig. 2A; maximum survival 35% at 1 × 10–8m). The tricyclic dimer 6 was particularly potent, with pEC50 of 10.96 ± 0.32 (corresponding to an EC50 of 11 pm), making it ∼10-fold more potent than the bicyclic amide-linked dimer 5, and 1000-fold more potent than the bicyclic disulfide-linked dimer 4. However, like the bicyclic dimers, tricyclic dimer 6 also displayed a bell-shaped concentration-response curve, although the curve width was ∼2-fold greater than either 4 or 5. In competition with BDNF, the tricyclic dimer 6 caused significant and concentration-dependent inhibition of BDNF-mediated neuronal survival (Fig. 2B; maximal inhibition 47% ± 6 at 1 × 10–6m; pIC50 10.13 ± 0.08). These values were not statistically different from those of either the bicyclic dimeric peptide 4 or the monocyclic monomeric peptide 1 (analysis of variance, Bonferroni's multiple comparison test). This article describes the design of low molecular weight, conformationally constrained dimeric peptide mimetics of the neurotrophic factor BDNF. The peptides were based on the monocyclic monomeric peptide 1 (a mimetic of a single solvent-exposed loop 2 of BDNF), a compound we had previously shown to behave as a competitive trkB antagonist (15O'Leary P.D. Hughes R.A. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 1712-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Using the three-dimensional structure of the BDNF dim"
https://openalex.org/W1989939905,"We used both a gene knockout approach and pharmacologic modulation to study the implication of the JNK pathway in regulating fibroblast motility, capacity to contract mechanically unloaded collagen gels, and type I collagen gene expression in vitro. These parameters, which are important for tissue repair, are positively regulated by transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, a cytokine viewed as playing a master role during wound healing. We demonstrate that basal JNK activity is critical for fibroblast motility because (a) mouse embryo jnk–/– fibroblasts exhibit significantly lower ability to close mechanically induced cell layer wounds than their wild-type (wt) counterparts, and (b) wound closure by human dermal fibroblasts is dramatically impaired by the specific JNK inhibitor SP600125. junAA fibroblasts, in which amino acids Ser63 and Ser73 of c-Jun are replaced by two Ala residues so that c-Jun cannot be phosphorylated by JNK, also exhibited impaired motility, suggesting that c-Jun phosphorylation by JNK is critical for fibroblast migration. In sharp contrast to their lesser motility on plastic, jnk–/– and junAA fibroblasts contracted free-floating, mechanically unloaded, collagen lattices markedly faster than wt fibroblasts. Furthermore, basal mRNA steady-state levels for types I and III collagen genes were similar in jnk–/– and wt fibroblasts. Likewise, overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant form of MKK4 in dermal fibroblasts did not affect collagen expression. We also demonstrate that basal JNK activity does not affect either TGF-β-induced collagen gene expression or lattice contraction, whereas on the other hand, the blockage of motility initiated by JNK inhibition cannot be overcome by TGF-β. Together these results demonstrate discrete, yet significant and highly specific, regulation of fibroblast functions important for wound healing by basal JNK activity.

Together these results demonstrate discrete, yet significant and highly specific, regulation of fibroblast functions important for wound healing by basal JNK activity. Efficient cutaneous wound repair implies carefully orchestrated molecular events allowing fibroblasts to migrate to the wound site(s), contract the wound, and synthesize extracellular matrix to restore skin integrity. Cellular signals underlying such events are not fully understood, but it is well accepted that transforming growth factor (TGF) 1The abbreviations used are: TGF, transforming growth factor; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; wt, wild-type; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; MKK, MAP kinase kinase; D/N, dominant-negative. 1The abbreviations used are: TGF, transforming growth factor; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; wt, wild-type; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; MKK, MAP kinase kinase; D/N, dominant-negative.-β, by means of its pleiotropic activities, plays a central role in orchestrating the various phases of wound healing (1Roberts A.B.

Dermatol. 2002; 118: 211-215Google Scholar). Extracellular stimuli elicit specific intracellular signals via activation of a family of so-called mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, consisting of extracellular signal-regulated kinases, p38 MAP kinases, and the JNKs (4Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Science's STKE. 1999; (http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/oc_sigtrans;1999/1/pe1)Google Scholar, 5Schramek H. News Physiol. Sci. 2002; 17: 62-67Google Scholar, 6Ichijo H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6087-6093Google Scholar). These MAP kinases phosphorylate transcription factors within the cell nucleus, thereby activating a number of cellular functions, including proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, and regulation of gene expression. It has been reported that the extracellular signal-regulated kinases and p38 MAP kinases are activated in fibroblasts during collagen matrix contraction under isometric tension (7Lee D.J. Rosenfeldt H. Grinnell F. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 257: 190-197Google Scholar) and that they cooperate in contraction-stimulated activation of the immediate early gene c-fos, although they are not required for lattice contraction per se (8Rosenfeldt H. Lee D.J. Grinnell F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2659-2667Google Scholar). In mechanically unloaded collagen lattices, on the other hand, extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling is disrupted, a mechanism that may be responsible for the entry of fibroblast into a quiescent state after several days under these conditions (9Rosenfeldt H. Grinnell F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3088-3092Google Scholar). The JNK group of MAP kinases, also known as stress-activated kinases, are activated upon exposure of cells to cytokines, growth factors, and environmental stresses such as UV irradiation or heat shock (10Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Google Scholar). Three distinct genes, jnk1, jnk2, and jnk3, have been identified to encode JNKs. The former two genes are ubiquitously expressed, whereas jnk3 is selectively expressed in the heart, testis, and brain. Dual Thr and Tyr phosphorylation of JNK by the MAP kinase kinases (MKKs), MKK4 and MKK7, results in JNK activation and nuclear translocation. In the nucleus, JNKs phosphorylate transcription factors such as c-Jun (11Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Google Scholar), a process that leads to maximal transcriptional activity of the latter (12Yang D. Tournier C. Wysk M. Lu H.T. Xu J. Davis R.J. Flavell R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3004-3009Google Scholar). Thus far, little is known about the role of JNK in the context of fibroblast ability to remodel collagen matrices, except that it was shown recently that JNK regulates the phenotypic modulation of lung fibroblasts into myofibroblasts induced by TGF-β (13Hashimoto S. Gon Y. Takeshita I. Matsumoto K. Maruoka S. Horie T. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2001; 163: 152-157Google Scholar), interleukin 4, and interleukin 13 (14Hashimoto S. Gon Y. Takeshita I. Maruoka S. Horie T. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2001; 107: 1001-1008Google Scholar). Recent data from our laboratory have indicated that basal JNK activity in fibroblasts maintains a limited yet significant pool of phosphorylated c-Jun protein (15Verrecchia F. Tacheau C. Wagner E.F. Mauviel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1585-1593Google Scholar). In this report, using pharmacologic and genetic approaches aimed at interfering with basal JNK activity, we demonstrate a critical role for the latter in allowing fibroblast motility, whereas it inhibits the ability of fibroblasts to contract free-floating collagen matrices and does not modify the expression of fibrillar collagen genes or their modulation by TGF-β. Details are provided herein. Cell Cultures—Human dermal fibroblasts were established by explanting neonatal foreskins. Immortalized fibroblast cell lines derived from wild-type (wt) and jnk1–/–-jnk2–/– (referred to henceforth as jnk–/–) mouse embryos (16Sabapathy K. Jochum W. Hochedlinger K. Chang L. Karin M. Wagner E.F. Mech. Dev. 1999; 89: 115-124Google Scholar), in which targeted disruption of jnk1 and jnk2 has been performed simultaneously, and junAA immortalized fibroblasts derived from mouse embryos carrying a mutant c-jun allele in which the JNK phospho-acceptor serines 63 and 73 are mutated to alanines (17Behrens A. Sibilia M. Wagner E.F. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 326-329Google Scholar) were a kind gift from Dr. Erwin F. Wagner (Institute for Molecular Pathology, Vienna, Austria). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin G, and 0.25 μg/ml Fungizone™). Human recombinant TGF-β1, purchased from R&D Systems Inc. (Minneapolis, MN), referred to as TGF-β throughout the text, was used at a concentration of 10 ng/ml. SP600125, a specific JNK inhibitor (18Han Z. Boyle D.L. Chang L. Bennett B. Karin M. Yang L. Manning A.M. Firestein G.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 73-81Google Scholar, 19Bennett B.L. Sasaki D.T.

A. 2001; 98: 13681-13686Google Scholar), was purchased from Calbiochem-Novabiochem. Collagen Matrix Contraction—Fibroblasts were harvested from monolayer culture with 0.25% trypsin and 1 mm EDTA, and then trypsin was neutralized with 10% fetal calf serum-containing medium. Collagen lattices in 60-mm dishes were prepared with 7 ml of a mixture containing 106 fibroblasts and 1 mg/ml native type I collagen (Biocoat™; BD Biosciences) in medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. When needed, TGF-β was added to the mixture before polymerization of the collagen matrix. Polymerization of collagen matrices required ∼60 min at 37 °C. To initiate lattice contraction, freshly polymerized matrices were released from the underlying culture dish with a few gentle taps on the dish. Wound Closure and Transwell™ Motility Assays—For wound closure assays, confluent cell monolayers were wounded by manually scraping the cells with a pipette tip. After wounding, wound size was verified to ensure that all wounds were the same width (see corresponding figures). The cell culture medium was then replaced with fresh medium, and wound closure was monitored by microscopy at various times. Transwell™ migration assays were performed utilizing 8-μm pore, 6.5-mm polycarbonate Transwell™ filters (Falcon, Franklin Lakes, NJ). In some experiments, a type I collagen solution (10 μg in 100 μl) was allowed to polymerize in the upper well for 1 h at 37 °C. Single cell suspensions were seeded onto the upper surface of the filters in medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (without or with prior collagen coating) and allowed to migrate through the membrane. After a 16-h incubation period, cells on the upper surface of the filter were wiped off with a cotton swab, and the cells that had migrated to the underside of the filter were fixed, stained with DiffQuick™ (Dade Behring, Düdingen, Switzerland), and counted by bright-field microscopy at ×200 in six random fields. Northern Blotting—Total RNA was obtained using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden Germany) and analyzed by Northern hybridization (20 μg/lane) with 32P-labeled cDNA probes for COL1A1 (20Chu M.L. de Wet W. Bernard M. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2315-2320Google Scholar), COL1A2 (21Chu M.L. Myers J.C. Bernard M.P. Ding J.F. Ramirez F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 5925-5934Google Scholar), COL3A1 (22Chu M.L. Weil D. de Wet W. Bernard M. Sippola M. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4357-4363Google Scholar), and GAPDH (23Fort P. Marty L. Piechaczyk M. el Sabrouty S. Dani C. Jeanteur P. Blanchard J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 1431-1442Google Scholar). Hybridization signal was revealed with a PhosphorImager (Storm 840; Amersham Biosciences). Western Blotting—Whole cell extracts were prepared in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% SDS, and 1 mm sodium vanadate; treated with Benzon nuclease (Sigma) for 5 min at room temperature; and denatured by heating at 95 °C for 3 min. Protein concentration in each lysate was assayed with a one-step colorimetric method (Bio-Rad protein reagent; Bio-Rad), and 25 μg of protein was resolved by SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to Hybond ECL nitrocellulose filters (Amersham Biosciences). Filters were placed in blocking solution (1× Tris-buffered saline and 5% nonfat milk) for 1 h and immunoblotted with either goat anti-type I collagen (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL), rabbit anti-phospho-c-Jun (Upstate Biotechnologies, Lake Placid, NY), anti-JNK1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), or anti-phospho-JNK1 (Cell Signaling Technology Inc., Beverly, MA) at a 1:1000 dilution in 1× Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20, and 5% nonfat milk for 1 h. A mouse anti-β-actin (Sigma) antibody at a 1:10,000 dilution in 5% nonfat milk was used as a control. For detection of phosphorylated proteins, nonfat milk was replaced by bovine serum albumin. After incubation, filters were washed and incubated with appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h. Filters were then washed, developed according to chemiluminescence protocols (ECL; Amersham Biosciences), and revealed with a PhosphorImager (Storm 840; Amersham Biosciences). Transient Cell Transfections and Electroporation—To determine basal JNK activity, we used a reporter system derived from the mammalian one-hybrid system, consisting of a reporter plasmid, Gal4-lux, and a trans-activator plasmid encoding a chimeric trans-activator protein (Gal4BD-c-Jun) consisting of the DNA binding domain of Gal4 (Gal4BD) and the transactivation domain of c-Jun that requires phosphorylation by JNK to fully transactivate Gal4-lux (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Transfections were performed using the calcium phosphate/DNA co-precipitation procedure with a commercial assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI). pRSV-β-galactosidase was co-transfected in every experiment to monitor transfection efficiencies. Luciferase activity was determined with a commercial kit (Promega). For high transfection efficiency of a dominant-negative (D/N) MKK4 expression vector (a kind gift from Dr. A. Atfi; INSERM U482, Paris, France) (24Atfi A. Djelloul S. Chastre E. Davis R. Gespach C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1429-1432Google Scholar), human dermal fibroblasts were electroporated with a Nucleofector™ (Amaxa GmbH, Koeln, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Transfection efficiency was estimated to be around 80% (data not shown) by fluorescence-activated cell-sorting analysis of a co-transfected green fluorescent protein expression vector. We first determined the JNK status under the experimental conditions used in the present study. To this end, we first measured the respective levels of phospho-c-Jun, phospho-JNK1, and JNK1 in jnk–/– and wt mouse fibroblasts, the latter of which were treated or not treated with SP600125. Results presented in Fig. 1A confirm the absence of JNK1 expression and the lack of phosphorylation of c-Jun in jnk–/– cells. They also demonstrate that SP600125 at a concentration of 20 μm strongly reduces the basal phosphorylation levels of JNK and c-Jun in wt fibroblasts. These results were further confirmed in the mammalian one-hybrid system described under “Materials and Methods,” measuring the transcriptional status of Gal4BD-c-Jun under the various conditions described above (Fig. 1B). We confirm the Western blot data because (a) luciferase activity is dramatically lower in jnk–/– fibroblasts as compared with their wt counterparts, reflective of an absence of JNK activity in the former cell type, and (b) SP600125 potently inhibits Gal4-lux activity in wt fibroblasts, consistent with its role as a JNK inhibitor (18Han Z. Boyle D.L. Chang L. Bennett B. Karin M. Yang L. Manning A.M. Firestein G.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 73-81Google Scholar, 19Bennett B.L. Sasaki D.T. Murray B.W. O'Leary E.C. Sakata S.T. Xu W. Leisten J.C. Motiwala A. Pierce S. Satoh Y. Bhagwat S.S. Manning A.M. Anderson D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13681-13686Google Scholar) acting on detectable basal kinase activity. These results are in agreement with our recent description that overexpression of a dominant-negative form of MKK4, the kinase directly upstream of JNK, reduces phosphoc-Jun-dependent transcription in unstimulated human dermal fibroblasts (15Verrecchia F. Tacheau C. Wagner E.F. Mauviel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1585-1593Google Scholar). Once the JNK status was clearly defined in our experiments, we examined the role of its basal activity on fibroblast motility. Initially, we compared the motility of wt, jnk–/–, and junAA immortalized mouse embryo fibroblasts in a wound closure assay. As shown in Fig. 2, wt fibroblasts migrated into the wound area and completely closed the wound within 14 h (top left panels). On the other hand, in jnk–/– fibroblast cultures, the wounds remained open (Fig. 2, middle left panels). Variations in cell proliferation did not account for the differences between wt and jnk–/– fibroblasts because wt fibroblasts closed the wound equally rapidly in the absence or presence of mitomycin C (4 μg/ml), a compound that blocks cell division (data not shown). Because c-Jun is a key substrate for JNK, junAA fibroblasts, in which c-Jun Ser63 and Ser73 have been mutated into alanines so that c-Jun can no longer be phosphorylated by JNK, were used to determine whether c-Jun phosphorylation by JNK was important for the effect of basal JNK activity on fibroblast motility. As shown in Fig. 2 (bottom panels), junAA fibroblasts were identified as poorly motile in the same wound closure assay described above, undistinguishable from jnk–/– fibroblasts (Fig. 2, middle panels). These data indicate that the basal state of c-Jun phosphorylation by JNK is critical for cell migration. Next, because TGF-β is a known activator of fibroblast motility (25Postlethwaite A.E. Keski-Oja J. Moses H.L. Kang A.H. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 165: 251-256Google Scholar), we tried to determine whether TGF-β would be able to accelerate fibroblast migration in the absence of basal JNK activity. When either jnk–/– or junAA fibroblasts were treated with TGF-β (Fig. 2, right panels), no significant difference in migration within the wound could be observed as compared with untreated cultures, indicating that TGF-β cannot overcome the impairment in motility induced by the loss of basal JNK activity or by the absence of basal levels of phospho-c-Jun. The striking difference in cell motility between wt and jnk–/– immortalized fibroblasts raised the question of whether such a phenomenon may be specific for either the knockout or the immortalized phenotype. This led us to determine whether pharmacologic inhibition of JNK activity in either wt immortalized fibroblasts or human dermal fibroblasts would impair their motility in the same wound closure assay. For this purpose, we used SP600125, a specific JNK inhibitor (18Han Z. Boyle D.L. Chang L. Bennett B. Karin M. Yang L. Manning A.M. Firestein G.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 73-81Google Scholar, 19Bennett B.L. Sasaki D.T. Murray B.W. O'Leary E.C. Sakata S.T. Xu W. Leisten J.C. Motiwala A. Pierce S. Satoh Y. Bhagwat S.S. Manning A.M. Anderson D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13681-13686Google Scholar), at a concentration of 20 μm, which is sufficient to inhibit basal JNK activity, as measured by either Western blotting for phospho-JNK or in a modified mammalian two-hybrid system specific for phospho-c-Jun-driven transactivation (see Fig. 1). Under these conditions, wt fibroblasts treated with SP600125 were unable to close a mechanically generated wound in a confluent cell layer (Fig. 3A, bottom panels), whereas cells treated with the solvent alone did (top panels). Moreover, consistent with the results obtained using jnk–/– fibroblasts, TGF-β was unable to reverse the inhibitory effect of SP600125 in wt fibroblasts. Similar results were obtained with normal human skin fibroblasts (Fig. 3B): Me2SO-treated dermal fibroblasts rapidly migrated into the wound, and the latter was completely closed within 20 h (top panels). On the other hand, SP600125-treated cultures were blocked in their ability to close the wound, even when treated with TGF-β (bottom panels). Together, these experiments identify basal JNK activity as a critical component of the cell machinery allowing fibroblast migration. Interestingly, these results prolong our recent identification of a role for basal JNK activity in maintaining a pool of transcriptionally active, phosphorylated c-Jun protein in fibroblasts, leading to detectable phospho-c-Jun-dependent gene transactivation under unstimulated conditions (15Verrecchia F. Tacheau C. Wagner E.F. Mauviel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1585-1593Google Scholar). We next attempted to determine whether the JNK pathway is involved during collagen gel contraction by fibroblasts, a phenomenon that involves both extracellular matrix remodeling and cell motility (reviewed in Ref. 26Grinnell F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 401-404Google Scholar). To this end, we compared the behavior of wt, jnk–/–, and junAA fibroblasts placed in free-floating, mechanically unloaded, collagen gels. The kinetics of collagen gel contraction was then recorded over a 7-day period. As shown in Fig. 4, jnk–/– and junAA fibroblasts were significantly more potent that their wt counterparts in contracting collagen gels. Maximal lattice contraction by jnk–/– and junAA fibroblasts was submaximal 2 days after plating, leading to a ∼70% reduction of the original lattice size, whereas gel contraction by wt fibroblasts never exceeded 30%, even over a 15-day period (data not shown). No significant changes in cell proliferation within the collagen gels were detected with either cell type over the time course of the experiments, as measured by counting cells after bacterial collagenase digestion of the lattices (data not shown). When added immediately after mixing the cell suspension in the collagen solution, TGF-β significantly accelerated gel contraction by wt, jnk–/–, and junAA fibroblasts. A representative experiment is shown in Fig. 4A. Under such experimental conditions, lattice contraction reached the same extent with either wt fibroblasts or jnk–/– and junAA fibroblasts, although the maximum was attained slightly later in the case of wt fibroblasts (Fig. 4B). Together, these results demonstrate that basal JNK activity reduces the capacity of fibroblasts to contract collagen gels but does not alter the potentiation of this phenomenon by TGF-β. It is noteworthy that we recently identified JunB, another JNK target, as a potential substitute for c-Jun to mediate antagonistic effects of TNF-α against TGF-β-dependent gene transcription in junAA fibroblasts (15Verrecchia F. Tacheau C. Wagner E.F. Mauviel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1585-1593Google Scholar). Specifically, we determined that TNF-α efficiently blocks TGF-β signaling in junAA fibroblasts, whereas it does not do so in jnk–/– fibroblasts. A dominant-negative mutant form of MKK4 that prevents JNK activation efficiently blocked the effect of TNF-α against TGF-β in junAA cells, indicating that this inhibitory mechanism is dependent on JNK function and utilizes a substrate other than c-Jun. By means of antisense approaches, we determined that JunB substitutes for JunAA to mediate the inhibitory activity of TNF-α against Smad signaling in a JNK-dependent manner. Contrasting with the latter results, in the present investigation, which was carried out in the absence of cytokine stimulation (i.e. when only basal JNK activity may be involved), junAA and jnk–/– fibroblasts both exhibit impaired motility (Fig. 2) and increased contractile activity (Fig. 4), as compared with their wt counterparts. Such identical behavior suggests that no other JNK substrate is able to replace the JunAA mutant in the context of either cell motility or capacity of fibroblasts to contract collagen gels. One plausible explanation would be that basal JunB expression (i.e. not induced by cytokines) in fibroblasts is very low and is not sufficient to drive detectable JNK-dependent transcriptional effects, whereas c-Jun is expressed at levels sufficient to transmit basal JNK activity. Another possibility may derive from the fact that JunB is a weaker transcriptional activator than c-Jun (27Chiu R. Angel P. Karin M. Cell. 1989; 59: 979-986Google Scholar, 28Schutte J. Viallet J. Nau M. Segal S. Fedorko J. Minna J. Cell. 1989; 59: 987-997Google Scholar, 29Mauviel A. Chen Y. Dong W. Evans C.H. Uitto J. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 822-831Google Scholar). In the context of TNF-α-induced JunB neosynthesis, the latter relays, at least in part, some of the JNK signals when c-Jun expression or activation by JNK is blocked (15Verrecchia F. Tacheau C. Wagner E.F. Mauviel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1585-1593Google Scholar). Mechanistically, the small G protein Rac has been implicated in both cell motility and floating matrix contraction (30Grinnell F. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 362-365Google Scholar). Furthermore, a parallel decrease in both fibroblast motility and fibroblast capacity to contract free-floating gels has been correlated to the aging process (31Reed M.J. Ferara N.S. Vernon R.B. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2001; 122: 1203-1220Google Scholar). Specifically, poorly contractile fibroblasts derived from older tissue donors display lower motility than fibroblasts from younger donors, the latter of which also exhibit a better capacity to contract free-floating collagen gels. It appears that the link between collagen gel contraction and cell motility is largely circumstantial, and no definitive mechanistic proof has been established thus far to link these two phenomena. Because the results presented above go against such scheme, we tried to establish another assay capable of addressing the issue of whether cell contact to collagen may modify fibroblast motility. For this purpose, we utilized another motility assay based on the Transwell™ system, which is able to measure the cell migratory potential through nylon membrane pores in the absence or presence of a collagen coating (see “Materials and Methods”). As shown in Fig. 5, jnk–/– fibroblasts exhibited a much lower capacity to migrate through the Transwell™ membrane than their wt counterparts, and this capacity was not influenced, either positively or negatively, by the collagen coating. These data, in full compliance with those obtained using the in vitro wound closure assay presented in Figs. 2 and 3, allow us to conclude that basal JNK activity is an important parameter allowing fibroblast motility. We next examined whether basal JNK activity may influence basal fibrillar collagen gene expression and its up-regulation by TGF-β. As a first attempt to address this hypothesis, confluent wt and jnk–/– fibroblast cultures were incubated for 24 h in the absence or presence of TGF-β, after which expression of type I and type III collagen genes was determined by Northern analysis of total RNA. As shown in Fig. 6A, remarkably similar basal steady-state mRNA levels for COL1A1, COL1A2, and COL3A1 were detected in wt and jnk–/– fibroblasts. A 24-h incubation with TGF-β resulted in marked up-regulation of the expression of each of these genes, which was identical in its magnitude in both cell types. Type I collagen production, estimated by Western blotting (Fig. 6B), showed identical basal levels in both wt and jnk–/– fibroblasts, as well as similar induction in response to TGF-β. Secondly, human dermal fibroblasts were transfected with either empty or D/N MKK4 expression vectors by means of a Nucleofector™ (see “Materials and Methods”), after which collagen gene expression was measured by Northern hybridization. Results presented in Fig. 6C demonstrate that D/N MKK4 expression does not modify either basal (lane 3 versus lane 1)or TGF-β-induced (lane 4 versus lane 2) collagen mRNA steady-state levels. Together with the results obtained using jnk–/– fibroblasts, these data demonstrate that basal JNK activity in fibroblasts is not a determinant for either basal fibrillar collagen gene expression or the extent of its activation by TGF-β, contrasting sharply with the critical role played by JNK activation in the ability of inflammatory cytokines to antagonize the up-regulation of fibrillar collagen genes by TGF-β (15Verrecchia F. Tacheau C. Wagner E.F. Mauviel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1585-1593Google Scholar). Conclusions—Cell migration has been considered a key event responsible for collagen gel contraction by fibroblasts under mechanically unloaded conditions. The results presented in this report suggest that a correlation between the two phenomena is only coincidental because cellular signaling driven by basal JNK activity differentially modulates these two cellular functions. Specifically, we provide definitive evidence for a critical role for basal JNK activity in allowing fibroblasts to migrate, whereas, at the same time, it severely alters their capacity to contract collagen gels and does not affect fibrillar collagen gene expression. Our data identify the basal activity of the JNK pathway as highly selective in controlling several fibroblast functions essential for tissue repair, namely, cell migration, matrix contraction, and collagen biosynthesis. In vivo relevance to wound healing requires further investigations. We thank Drs. A. Atfi, F. Bernerd (L'Oréal Recherche, Clichy, France), and Erwin F. Wagner for reagents and advice."

Using the β1-adrenergic receptor carboxyl terminus as bait, we identified the novel β1-adrenergic receptor-binding partner GIPC in a yeast two-hybrid screen of a human heart cDNA library. Here we demonstrate that the PDZ domain-containing protein, GIPC, co-immunoprecipitates with the β1-adrenergic receptor in COS-7 cells. Essential for this interaction is the Ser residue of the β1-adrenergic receptor carboxyl-terminal ESKV motif. Our data also demonstrate that β1-adrenergic receptor stimulation activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase, ERK1/2. β1-adrenergic receptor-mediated ERK1/2 activation was inhibited by pertussis toxin, implicating Gi, and was substantially decreased by the expression of GIPC. Expression of GIPC had no observable effect on β1-adrenergic receptor sequestration or receptor-mediated cAMP accumulation. This GIPC effect was specific for the β1-adrenergic receptor and was dependent on an intact PDZ binding motif. These data suggest that GIPC can regulate β1-adrenergic receptor-stimulated, Gi-mediated, ERK activation while having no effect on receptor internalization or Gs-mediated cAMP signaling. β1-adrenergic receptors, expressed at high levels in the human heart, have a carboxyl-terminal ESKV motif that can directly interact with PDZ domain-containing proteins.

Pharmacol. Ther. 1993; 60: 405-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). There are three subtypes of βAR, β1AR, β2AR, and β3AR. Both the β1AR and β2AR subtypes are expressed in the heart and appear to regulate cardiac function through similar intracellular signaling pathways (2Brodde O.E. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 203-242PubMed Google Scholar). These receptors are members of the seven transmembrane spanning receptor superfamily and are thought to signal largely through heterotrimeric G proteins; primarily Gs. Activation of Gs stimulates adenylate cyclase increasing intracellular cAMP. Increased cAMP activates cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), which is believed to mediate many of the cellular responses associated with βAR activation (3Pierce K.L. Premont R.T. Lefkowitz R.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 639-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (2125) Google Scholar, 4Lefkowitz R.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E133-E136Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Despite similarities in signaling, there are several striking physiological differences between the β1AR and β2AR subtypes (5Steinberg S.F. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 1101-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 6Xiao R.P. Cheng H. Zhou Y.Y. Kuschel M. Lakatta E.G. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 1092-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). For example, β1AR and β2AR subtypes play opposing roles in regulating cardiac myocyte apoptosis: stimulation of the β1AR increases apoptosis, whereas stimulation of the β2AR inhibits apoptosis (7Communal C. Singh K. Sawyer D.B. Colucci W.S. Circulation. 1999; 100: 2210-2212Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 8Zhu W.Z. Zheng M. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Kobilka B.K. Xiao R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1607-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). β1AR-induced apoptosis is implicated in the transition from cardiac hypertrophy to heart failure (9Kang P.M. Izumo S. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 1107-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 10Xiao R.P. Sci. STKE. 2001; (http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;2001/104/re15)PubMed Google Scholar). The differential regulation of cardiac cell survival by these βAR subtypes has been partially explained by the ability of the β2AR to couple to the pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive G protein, Gi (11Chesley A. Lundberg M.S. Asai T. Xiao R.P. Ohtani S. Lakatta E.G. Crow M.T. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 1172-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). β2ARs in human and mouse cardiomyocytes have been shown to activate both Gs and Gi, whereas β1AR stimulation has, thus far, only been shown to activate Gs (12Xiao R.P. Avdonin P. Zhou Y.Y. Cheng H. Akhter S.A. Eschenhagen T. Lefkowitz R.J. Koch W.J. Lakatta E.G. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Activation of the β2AR, stimulates a Gi-mediated PI3K-Akt-dependent cell-survival signaling pathway and prevents cardiomyocytes from undergoing Gs-mediated apoptosis (11Chesley A. Lundberg M.S. Asai T. Xiao R.P. Ohtani S. Lakatta E.G. Crow M.T. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 1172-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest that Gs to Gi switching by the β2AR is the consequence of PKA-mediated receptor phosphorylation (13Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1997; 390: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar, 14Zamah A.M. Delahunty M. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31249-31256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). β2AR/Gi coupling has also been implicated in receptor-meditated ERK activation (13Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1997; 390: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar, 15Luttrell L.M. van Biesen T. Hawes B.E. Koch W.J. Krueger K.M. Touhara K. Lefkowitz R.J. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1997; 31: 263-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). β2AR-stimulated ERK1/2 activation has been reported in cultured HEK-293 and COS-7 cells, and in isolated cardiac myocytes (16Crespo P. Cachero T.G. Xu N. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25259-25265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 17Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Ahn S. Della Rocca G.J. Ferguson S.S. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 685-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). This β2AR-stimulated ERK1/2 activation is mediated by βγ subunits of PTX-sensitive G proteins (Gi) through a pathway involving the non-receptor tyrosine kinase c-Src, small G protein Ras and Raf-1 kinase (15Luttrell L.M. van Biesen T.

Pharmacol. 2002; 80: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The mechanism(s) of β1AR-stimulated ERK activation is somewhat more controversial. A number of groups have reported that the β1AR is unable to stimulate ERK activation, a conclusion based on the perceived inability of the β1AR to couple to Gi (19Lavoie C. Mercier J.F. Salahpour A. Umapathy D. Breit A. Villeneuve L.R. Zhu W.Z. Xiao R.P. Lakatta E.G. Bouvier M. Hebert T.E. J. Biol.

However, recent data from cardiac myocytes suggest that the β1AR can activate ERK and p38 in a Gi-dependent manner; even though the β1AR is less potent in stimulating ERK activation than the β2AR (11Chesley A. Lundberg M.S. Asai T. Xiao R.P. Ohtani S. Lakatta E.G. Crow M.T. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 1172-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 21Communal C. Colucci W.S. Singh K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19395-19400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The mechanisms behind the observed differential activation of ERK are still unknown. Recent data suggest that βARs may transduce signals that are both dependent and independent of heterotrimeric G proteins (22Brzostowski J.A. Kimmel A.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 291-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 23Hall R.A. Premont R.T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 927-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Well known receptor-interacting proteins, such as β-arrestins and G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs), which were thought previously only to regulate receptor desensitization, have been implicated in signaling pathways that may be G protein-independent (24Miller W.E. Lefkowitz R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 25Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J.

Another G protein-independent mechanism underlying βAR-mediated cell signaling has recently been demonstrated. Both β1ARs and β2ARs have carboxyl-terminal PDZ binding motifs reported to bind to PDZ domain-containing proteins (27Hall R.A. Premont R.T. Chow C.W. Blitzer J.T. Pitcher J.A. Claing A. Stoffel R.H.

The β2AR has been shown to interact with Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factors (NHERF) in an agonist-dependent manner via this PDZ binding domain (27Hall R.A. Premont R.T. Chow C.W. Blitzer J.T.

Association with PSD-95 regulates agonist stimulated β1AR internalization and may also provide a molecular mechanism by which β1ARs are localized to the synapse, regulating synaptic plasticity (28Hu L.A.

Interactions between the β1AR and PDZ domain-containing proteins can be regulated by GRK5 (30Hu L.A. Chen W. Premont R.T. Cong M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

Furthermore, studies in cardiac myocytes have recently demonstrated that the PDZ binding motif of the β1AR modulates receptor trafficking and signaling (31Xiang Y. Devic E. Kobilka B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33783-33790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In order to identify proteins that interact with the PDZ binding domain of the β1AR, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen on a human heart cDNA library, using the β1AR carboxyl-terminal tail as bait. From this screen we identified GIPC (GAIP-interacting protein, carboxyl (C) terminus), a PDZ-containing protein, as a novel binding partner of the β1AR. Here we characterize this interaction and its functional consequences. Plasmids and Antibodies—Mammalian expression plasmids pcDNA3/FLAG-β1AR, pcDNA3/FLAG-β1AR (S475A), and pcDNA3/FLAG-β2AR have been described previously (28Hu L.A. Tang Y. Miller W.E. Cong M. Lau A.G.

Polyclonal anti-phospho-ERK1/2 antibody was from Cell Signaling Technology. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies were from Amersham Biosciences. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—Plasmid pAS2–1/β1AR-CT was used as bait to screen a human heart cDNA library (in pACT2) (Clontech). Bait plasmid and library cDNAs were co-transformed into the yeast strain PJ69–4A using a standard yeast transformation protocol. Yeast were plated on selective medium (S.D.-Leu/Trp/His, +10 mm 3AT) and allowed to grow for 4–6 days at 30 °C. Positive colonies were then restreaked on selective medium (S.D.-Leu/Trp/Ade or S.D.-Leu/Trp/His) plates. Plasmid DNA was rescued from positive colonies that grew on both -His and -Ade plates and subject to further sequence analysis. To further confirm positive interactions, isolated library cDNAs were co-transformed back into yeast together with a bait plasmid, either pAS2–1/β1AR-CT, empty vector pAS2–1, or other test plasmids as indicated in the text. Yeast was then subjected to growth tests on selective plates. Cell Culture and Transfection—All tissue culture media and related reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin in a 37 °C incubator under 5% CO2. Cells in 100-mm dishes were transfected with LipofectAMINE (at 4:1 ratio with DNA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. HEK-293 cells were maintained under the same conditions as COS-7 cells except minimal essential medium (MEM) was used. HEK-293 cells were transfected with FuGENE 6 (at 2.5:1 ratio with DNA) according to the manufacturer's protocol (Roche Applied Science). After transfection, cells were grown 36–48 h before agonist stimulation. Cellular Immunoprecipitations and Immunoblotting—Transfected COS-7 cells in 100-mm plates were incubated in serum-free medium for 60 min before agonist stimulation. The cells were then incubated in the presence or absence of 10 μm isoproterenol (ISO) for 10 min at 37 °C. The cells were rinsed with cold Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) and replaced with 1 ml of cross-linking buffer (DPBS containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 2.5 mm of the cell permeable cross-linking reagent dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) (DSP, Pierce)). For the stimulated cells, 10 μm ISO was present in the cross-linking buffer. The cells were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with continuous slow rocking. The cross-linking reaction was terminated by quickly removing the cross-linking buffer and replacing it with 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors). The cells were lysed by incubation on ice for 30 min and then clarified by centrifugation at 21,000 × g for 12 min at 4 °C. The clarified supernatants were then used in cellular coimmunoprecipitation experiments. 50 μl of each supernatant was diluted into an equal amount of 3× SDS-PAGE sample buffer to serve as whole cell extract controls. 1 ml of clarified cell extract was then incubated with 25 μl of anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel slurry at 4 °C with gentle rotation for 4 h to overnight. Beads were washed four to five times with ice-cold lysis buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted with 50 μl of 3× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Equivalent amounts of sample in 3× sample buffer were resolved on precast 4–20% polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen) and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by semi-dry blotting. Nitrocellulose membranes were blocked with 5% fat-free milk in TBST (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) and incubated with the appropriate primary antibody at room temperature for 1 h. After washing with TBST, membranes were incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or rabbit IgG secondary antibody (1:2000). Protein bands were visualized via SuperSignal Chemiluminescence Substrate (Pierce). Quantitation of band density was performed with Bio-Rad Fluor-S MultiImager. ERK Phosphorylation—Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were split into 6-well dishes and then incubated in serum-free media (DMEM for COS-7 and MEM for HEK-293, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) overnight before agonist stimulation. Agonist stimulation was performed at 37 °C in serum-free media for the times indicated in the figure legends. The medium was removed, and cells were then solubilized in 3× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The whole cell lysates were sonicated and resolved by SDS-PAGE. ERK phosphorylation was detected by Western blot using anti-phospho-ERK1/2 antibody as described above. The total ERK2 in the cell lysates was detected using anti-ERK2 polyclonal antibody. Protein bands were visualized via SuperSignal Chemiluminescence substrate and quantitated with Bio-Rad Fluor-S MultiImager. Receptor Internalization and Cyclic AMP Accumulation Assays—For receptor internalization assays, HEK-293 cells in 100-mm dishes were transiently transfected with pcDNA3/FLAG-β1AR in the presence and absence of Myc-GIPC. One day after transfection, cells were split into poly-d-lysine-coated 6-well plates (Biocoat) and grown overnight at 37 °C. Cells were serum-starved for 1 h before stimulation with 10 μm ISO for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were placed on ice and cell surface FLAG-tagged receptors were detected with anti-FLAG M2 antibody followed by FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG as described previously (35Freedman N.J. Liggett S.B. Drachman D.E. Pei G. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17953-17961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Receptor internalization was defined as the percentage of cell surface receptors lost after agonist stimulation, measured by cell flow cytometry. For cyclic AMP accumulation assays, HEK-293 cells in 100-mm dishes were transiently transfected with pcDNA3/FLAG-β1AR in the presence and absence of transfected Myc-GIPC. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were split into 12-well collagen-coated plates and then labeled with modified essential medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and 2 μCi/ml [3H]adenine for 4 h to overnight. Cells were serum-starved for 30 min and then stimulated with β1AR selective agonist dobutamine or 10 μm forskolin for 10 min. Cyclic AMP accumulation was quantitated by chromatography and expressed as a percentage of 3H incorporated into cyclic AMP as described previously (35Freedman N.J. Liggett S.B. Drachman D.E. Pei G. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17953-17961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). GIPC Binds Specifically to the β1AR Carboxyl-terminal Tail—In our search for potential β1AR binding partners, we used the β1AR carboxyl-terminal tail (β1AR-CT) as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen of a human heart cDNA library. From a total of 4 million independent colonies screened, 24 positive clones were obtained. Four of the positive clones yielded identical sequence encoding a portion of the gene for human GIPC (hGIPC), with an N-terminal truncation at residue 74. We also isolated rat GIPC from a yeast two-hybrid screen of rat brain. The isolated rat sequence (rGIPC) encoded full-length GIPC plus a portion of the 5′-untranslated region (Fig. 1). The specificity of the interaction between GIPC and the β1AR-CT was confirmed by further yeast two-hybrid analysis. GIPC clones were transformed back into yeast strain PJ69-4A together with baits (either β1AR-CT or β2AR-CT). Transformed yeast containing both bait and GIPC were then subjected to growth tests on selective medium. As shown in Fig. 1, only yeast hosting both GIPC and the β1AR-CT were able to grow on both -His and -Ade plates. The interaction between the β1AR and GIPC is specific, since the β2AR-CT did not support yeast growth under the same conditions when co-transformed with GIPC. The β1-Adrenergic Receptor Interacts with GIPC Through Its Carboxyl-terminal PDZ Binding Motif—In order to determine whether the full-length β1AR could associate with GIPC in the cell, COS-7 cells were co-transfected with FLAG-β1AR and Myc-GIPC. Immunoprecipitation of the β1AR followed by Western blotting for Myc-GIPC revealed robust co-immunoprecipitation of a GIPC/β1AR complex (Fig. 2). Treatment of the cells with the β-adrenergic receptor agonist ISO had no significant effect on the GIPC/β1AR association (data not shown). Consistent with the yeast two-hybrid results, GIPC did not co-immunoprecipitate with the full-length FLAG-β2AR when the two proteins were co-expressed in COS-7 cells. To examine the structural determinants of the GIPC/β1AR interaction, we used several β1AR mutants, in which three out of the last five residues were replaced with Ala individually (28Hu L.A. Tang Y. Miller W.E. Cong M. Lau A.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Hall R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38659-38666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Similar to that observed with the β1AR/PSD-95 interaction, when the Ser residue at the -2 position of the β1AR was mutated to either Ala (S475A) or Asp (S475D), the association of GIPC with the β1AR could no longer be detected. When GIPC was co-expressed with the β1AR mutant S473A, co-immunoprecipitation of GIPC was reduced only slightly relative to the wild-type β1AR. However, the β1AR mutant V477A, which is unable to bind with PSD-95, showed a very strong interaction with GIPC. These studies demonstrate by both yeast two-hybrid screening and cellular co-immunoprecipitation experiments that the GIPC specifically interacts with the β1AR through the PDZ domain. Unlike the association of the β1AR with PSD-95, the Val in the last position (Val-477) of the receptor is not required for the interaction with GIPC. GIPC Has No Effect on Receptor-stimulated Cyclic AMP Accumulation—Next we examined the effect of GIPC on β1AR-mediated whole cell cAMP accumulation. HEK-293 cells were transiently transfected with wild-type β1AR, and either Myc-tagged GIPC or vector alone. Dose-response curves of cAMP accumulation induced by the selective β1AR agonist dobutamine are shown in Fig. 3. Similar to previous results with PSD-95, GIPC expression had no effect on β1AR-mediated whole cell cAMP accumulation, changing neither the maximal level of cAMP accumulation nor the EC50. Because PDZ domain-containing proteins have previously been shown to regulate receptor internalization (28Hu L.A. Tang Y. Miller W.E. Cong M. Lau A.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Hall R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38659-38666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 29Xu J. Paquet M. Lau A.G. Wood J.D. Ross C.A. Hall R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41310-41317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), we also examined the effect of GIPC on β1AR internalization in HEK-293 cells. GIPC expression had no effect on agonist stimulated β1AR internalization (data not shown). β1 AR-stimulated ERK Activation—In order to examine β1AR-mediated ERK activation, we used a plasmid encoding an ERK2-GFP fusion protein. This allowed for GFP-ERK2 to be easily separated from endogenous ERK1/2 by SDS-PAGE. In COS-7 cells transiently transfected with pcDNA3/FLAG-β1AR and GFP-ERK2, ISO stimulation induced robust ERK phosphorylation/activation compared with non-stimulated cells (Fig. 4A). In control cells transfected with GFP-ERK2 alone, ISO-stimulated ERK phosphorylation was not detected using phospho-ERK antibody. Similar to previous studies of the β2AR, β1AR-stimulated ERK activation was a relatively fast process, peaking at around 5 min. At maximum, ISO-stimulated ERK activation was 6–8 fold greater than that of non-stimulated control cells (Fig. 4B). After peaking at 5 min, β1AR-stimulated ERK activation steadily decreased to ∼50% of maximum at 15 min. β1AR-stimulated ERK activation was observed over a range of agonist concentrations. The dose response curve for ISO-stimulated ERK activation is shown in Fig. 4C. Next we examined the effect of different agonists on β1AR-mediated ERK activation in COS-7 cells. The β1AR has a high affinity for both norepinephrine and epinephrine (2Brodde O.E. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 203-242PubMed Google Scholar). As predicted, norepinephrine (NE) stimulation dramatically increased ERK activation (Fig. 4D). The β1AR specific agonist dobutamine (Dobu) also stimulated ERK activation, but was much less active than either NE or ISO. As a control, PMA, the direct activator of PKC, demonstrated robust ERK activation, whereas the direct activator of adenylate cyclase, forskolin (Forsk), showed no demonstrable ERK activation. As expected, ISO-stimulated ERK activation was completely blocked by the β-adrenergic receptor antagonists propranolol (PRO) and alprenolol (ALP) (Fig. 4E). Treatment of cells with 10 μm PTX overnight decreased β1AR-mediated ERK activation considerably. To further demonstrate that PTX inhibited the activation of ERK by inhibiting the αi subunit of the G protein, we overexpressed a G protein αi1 subunit (C351S), which cannot be ADP-ribosylated and is therefore unaffected by PTX treatment. As shown in Fig. 4F, overexpression of Gi (C351S), while having little effect on the overall ISO-stimulated ERK activity, leads to a marked increase in ISO-stimulated ERK activation observed in the presence of PTX. The residual effect of PTX is presumably due to inhibition of endogenous Gi. These data further support the idea that the β1AR activates ERK through a Gi-mediated pathway, similar to that reported for the β2AR (13Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1997; 390: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). In contrast to findings with the β2AR (13Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1997; 390: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar), the PKA inhibitor H89 had no significant effect on β1AR-mediated ERK activation. GIPC Regulates β1AR-mediated ERK Activation—GIPC is a PDZ domain-containing protein that interacts with a Gi-specific RGS protein called GAIP (Gα-interacting protein) (34De Vries L. Lou X. Zhao G. Zheng B. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12340-12345Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar); therefore, GIPC could be involved in the regulation of Gi-mediated signaling. Here we tested the effect of GIPC on β1AR-stimulated ERK activation, which may be mediated by the PTX-sensitive G protein, Gi. As shown in Fig. 5A, expression of GIPC substantially decreased ISO-stimulated β1AR-mediated ERK activation. ISO-stimulated ERK activation in the presence of GIPC was decreased by 45% compared with control cells lacking GIPC (Fig. 5, A and D). Under similar conditions, expression of GIPC had little effect on β2AR-mediated ERK activation (Fig. 5B). The inhibitory effect of GIPC appeared to be specific for the β1AR. GIPC had no significant effect on the ability of the β1AR mutant (S475A), which is unable to interact with GIPC, to activate ERK (Fig. 5C). These data suggest that the ability of GIPC to regulate β1AR-mediated ERK activation is dependent on its ability to interact directly with the β1AR via its PDZ domain. β1ARs are of primary importance in regulating heart rate and contractility. Through a yeast two-hybrid screen of a human heart cDNA library, we identified GIPC as a novel binding partner for the β1AR. GIPC is a PDZ domain-containing protein that was originally identified and named as a protein that interacts with GAIP, an RGS (regulator of G protein signaling) protein (34De Vries L. Lou X. Zhao G. Zheng B. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12340-12345Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In addition to GAIP, GIPC has also been reported to interact with several membrane proteins through its PDZ domain; these include the Glut-1 transporter, transmembrane Semaphorin-F (M-SemF) (36Wang L.H.

Jalinot P. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Here we report a specific interaction between the β1AR and GIPC. Despite the fact that both the β1AR and β2AR contain similar PDZ binding motifs, GIPC interacts only with the β1AR, as demonstrated by both yeast two-hybrid screening and co-immunoprecipitation experiments. The GIPC PDZ domain facilitates the interaction with the β1AR. Mutation of Ser-475 to either Ala (S475A) or Asp (S475D) completely eliminated the interaction. However, unlike that reported for PSD-95, changing the last residue Val-477 of the β1AR to Ala had no effect on the β1AR/GIPC association. TAX, a protein containing a similar carboxyl-terminal ETEA-COOH motif has also been shown to interact with GIPC (43Rousset R. Fabre S. Desbois C. Bantignies F. Jalinot P. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). GIPC expression has no significant effect on β1AR-induced cAMP accumulation. Therefore, similar to PSD-95, the association of GIPC with the β1AR had no effect on β1AR coupling to Gs. In contrast to PSD-95, which inhibits receptor internalization in HEK-293 cells (31Xiang Y. Devic E. Kobilka B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33783-33790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), GIPC had little to no effect on agonist-stimulated receptor internalization. Recently, many GPCRs have been reported to activate MAP kinase cascades regulating cell growth and/or proliferation (18Luttrell L.M. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 2002; 80: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In COS-7 cells, it has been clearly demonstrated that stimulation of the β2AR activates the MAP kinase ERK through a Gi-mediated pathway (13Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1997; 390: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar, 44Schmitt J.M. Stork P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25342-25350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In cardiac myocytes, β2AR stimulation has been shown to activate the MAP kinases ERK, JNK, and p38 (21Communal C. Colucci W.S. Singh K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19395-19400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 45Zheng M. Zhang S.J. Zhu W.Z. Ziman B. Kobilka B.K. Xiao R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40635-40640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). However, β1AR-mediated ERK activation or coupling to Gi is still quite controversial. Here, we demonstrate β1AR stimulated, PTX-sensitive, ERK activation; strongly suggesting that the β1AR, like the β2AR, can signal through both Gs and Gi. GIPC, similar to many PDZ domain-containing proteins, has been shown to play an important role in organizing signaling cascades (46Lou X. Yano H. Lee F. Chao M.V. Farquhar M.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 615-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), anchoring proteins in specific subcellular compartments (40Awan A. Lucic M.R. Shaw D.M. Sheppard F. Westwater C. Lyons S.A. Stern P.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 1030-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and regulating cell signaling (39Blobe G.C. Liu X. Fang S.J. How T. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39608-39617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). GIPC regulates the expression of the TGF-β receptor at the cell surface and enhances the cellular response to TGF-β (39Blobe G.C. Liu X. Fang S.J. How T. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39608-39617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). GIPC has also been linked to G protein signaling by its ability to interact with the RGS protein GAIP (46Lou X. Yano H. Lee F. Chao M.V. Farquhar M.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 615-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Overexpression of GIPC in PC12 cells decreases NGF induced MAP kinase (ERK1/2) activation (38Booth R.A. Cummings C. Tiberi M. Liu X.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6719-6725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a GIPC-like protein Kermit, which interacts with the Frizzed receptor, has been reported to regulate frizzed 3 signaling in neural crest development (47Tan C. Deardorff M.A. Saint-Jeannet J.P. Yang J. Arzoumanian A. Klein P.S. Development. 2001; 128: 3665-3674PubMed Google Scholar). Here we provided further evidence that GIPC regulates G protein signaling by directly interacting with the β1AR in a PDZ-dependent manner. Expression of GIPC decreased the ability of the β1AR to stimulate ERK activation, but had no effect on β1AR-mediated cAMP accumulation. This regulatory effect of GIPC on ERK activation is specific for the β1AR and depends on a PDZ-mediated interaction, since expression of GIPC has no effect on the ERK activation stimulated by either the β2AR or the β1AR mutant (S475A). These data suggest that the GIPC/β1AR association affects receptor Gi- but not Gs-mediated signaling. In mouse cardiac myocytes, stimulation of the β1AR leads to a PKA-dependent increase in the rate of contraction (48Devic E. Xiang Y. Gould D. Kobilka B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 577-583PubMed Google Scholar). β2AR stimulation shows a biphasic effect on the rate of cardiac myocyte contraction, with an initial PKA-dependent increase followed by a PTX-sensitive decrease, mediated by Gi (48Devic E. Xiang Y. Gould D. Kobilka B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 577-583PubMed Google Scholar). Disruption of the PDZ binding motif in the β1AR changed the signaling profile of the β1AR in cardiac myocytes to more resemble that of the β2AR (31Xiang Y. Devic E. Kobilka B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33783-33790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the β1AR is capable of coupling to Gi, but that association with PDZ-containing proteins such as PSD-95 could prevent this interaction from occurring. GIPC interacts with the β1AR through its PDZ domain and thereby specifically inhibits β1AR-stimulated Gi-mediated signaling. Thus, the GIPC effect on β1AR-mediated ERK activation might explain the differential effects of β1AR and β2AR stimulation on the rate of cardiac myocyte contraction. The effect of GIPC on β1AR/Gi-mediated signaling could also explain the differential effects of β1AR and β2AR stimulation on cardiac myocyte apoptosis. β1AR stimulation leads to cardiac myocyte apoptosis, whereas stimulation of the β2AR concurrently activates pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic signals, the net effect being increased cell survival (8Zhu W.Z. Zheng M. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Kobilka B.K. Xiao R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1607-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Differential coupling to Gs and Gi has been used to explain this differential effect of β1AR versus β2AR stimulation (10Xiao R.P. Sci. STKE. 2001; (http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;2001/104/re15)PubMed Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that the β1AR can couple to both Gs and Gi, similar to a number of other GPCRs including the histamine, serotonin, and glucagon receptors (20Kilts J.D. Gerhardt M.A. Richardson M.D. Sreeram G. Mackensen G.B. Grocott H.P. White W.D. Davis R.D. Newman M.F. Reves J.G. Schwinn D.A. Kwatra M.M. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 705-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The continued study of receptor-interacting proteins, such as PDZ-containing proteins, will further our understanding of differential signaling by receptors. We thank Dr. Farquhar for providing GIPC clones, Millie McAdams and Judy Phelps for DNA sequencing, and Julia Turnbough and Donna Addison for assistance with the preparation of this manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2004499204,"Nramp2 (natural resistance-associated macrophage protein 2, also called DMT1 and Slc11a2) is a proton-dependent cation transporter, which plays a central role in iron homeostasis. To study the subcellular distribution and dynamics of the transporter, we generated a construct encoding the long splice variant of Nramp2 (isoform II) tagged with the hemagglutinin epitope on a predicted extracellular loop. Cells stably transfected with this construct revealed the presence of Nramp2 in both the plasma membrane and in an endomembrane compartment. By labeling the exofacial epitope with a pH-sensitive fluorescent indicator, we were able to establish that this variant of Nramp2 resides in a vesicular compartment with an acidic lumen (pH 6.2) and that acidification was maintained by vacuolar-type ATPases. Dual labeling experiments identified this compartment as sorting and recycling endosomes. Kinetic studies by surface labeling with 125I-labeled antibodies established that the fraction of endomembrane Nramp2 was approximately equal to that on the cell surface. The two components are in dynamic equilibrium: surface transporters are internalized continuously via a clathrin and dynamin-dependent process, whereas endosomal Nramp2 is recycled to the plasmalemma by a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent exocytic process. Depletion of cholesterol had no discernible effect on Nramp2 internalization, suggesting that rafts or caveolae are not essential. Because the pH at the cell surface and in endosomes differs by ≥1 unit, the rates of transport of Nramp2 at the surface and in endomembrane compartments will differ drastically. Their subcellular colocalization and parallel trafficking suggest that Nramp2 and transferrin receptors are functionally coupled to effect pH-dependent iron uptake across the endosomal membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2168252439,"Neurofibromin, the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) gene product, contains a central domain homologous to a family of proteins known as Ras-GTPase-activating proteins (Ras-GAPs), which function as negative regulators of Ras. The loss of neurofibromin function has been thought to be implicated in the abnormal regulation of Ras in NF1-related pathogenesis. In this study, we found a novel role of neurofibromin in neuronal differentiation in conjunction with the regulation of Ras activity via its GAP-related domain (GRD) in neuronal cells. In PC12 cells, time-dependent increases in the GAP activity of cellular neurofibromin (NF1-GAP) were detected after NGF stimulation, which were correlated with the down-regulation of Ras activity during neurite elongation. Interestingly, the NF1-GAP increase was due to the induction of alternative splicing of NF1-GRD type I triggered by the NGF-induced Ras activation. Dominant-negative (DN) forms of NF1-GRD type I significantly inhibited the neurite extension of PC12 cells via regulation of the Ras state. NF1-GRD-DN also reduced axonal and dendritic branching/extension of rat embryonic hippocampal neurons. These results demonstrate that the mutual regulation of Ras and NF1-GAP is essential for normal neuronal differentiation and that abnormal regulation in neuronal cells may be implicated in NF1-related learning and memory disturbance. Neurofibromin, the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) gene product, contains a central domain homologous to a family of proteins known as Ras-GTPase-activating proteins (Ras-GAPs), which function as negative regulators of Ras. The loss of neurofibromin function has been thought to be implicated in the abnormal regulation of Ras in NF1-related pathogenesis. In this study, we found a novel role of neurofibromin in neuronal differentiation in conjunction with the regulation of Ras activity via its GAP-related domain (GRD) in neuronal cells. In PC12 cells, time-dependent increases in the GAP activity of cellular neurofibromin (NF1-GAP) were detected after NGF stimulation, which were correlated with the down-regulation of Ras activity during neurite elongation. Interestingly, the NF1-GAP increase was due to the induction of alternative splicing of NF1-GRD type I triggered by the NGF-induced Ras activation. Dominant-negative (DN) forms of NF1-GRD type I significantly inhibited the neurite extension of PC12 cells via regulation of the Ras state. NF1-GRD-DN also reduced axonal and dendritic branching/extension of rat embryonic hippocampal neurons. These results demonstrate that the mutual regulation of Ras and NF1-GAP is essential for normal neuronal differentiation and that abnormal regulation in neuronal cells may be implicated in NF1-related learning and memory disturbance.

The NF1 hallmark is the development of benign tumors of the peripheral nervous system and the increased risk of developing malignancies. The NF1 phenotype is highly variable; it affects several organ systems, including bones, skin, irises, and central nervous system manifested as gliomas and learning disabilities. The NF1 gene lies on chromosome 17q11.2 and encodes neurofibromin, a large 2818-amino acid protein (2Cawthon R.M. Weiss R. Xu G.F. Viskochil D. Culver M. Stevens J. Robertson M. Dunn D. Gesteland R. O'Connell P. White R. Cell. 1990; 62: 193-201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). Since the majority of NF1 gene mutations frequently found in NF1 patients prevent intact neurofibromin expression, functional disruption of neurofibromin is potentially relevant to the expression of some or all of the multiple abnormalities that occur in NF1 patients (3Viskochil D. Buchberg A.M. Xu G. Cawthon R.M. Stevens J. Wolff R.K. Culver M. Carey J.C. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. White R. O'Connell P. Cell. 1990; 62: 187-192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar).A region centered around the 360 amino acids encoded by the NF1 gene shows significant homology to the known catalytic domains of mammalian Ras GTPase-activating protein (p120GAP) and is also similar to yeast IRA1/2 proteins, which interact with Ras and mediate hydrolysis of Ras-bound GTP to GDP, resulting in Ras protein inactivation. The GAP-related domain of the NF1 gene product (NF1-GRD) also stimulates Ras GTPase and consequently inactivates Ras protein (4Ballester R. Marchuk D. Boguski M. Saulino A. Letcher R. Wigler M.

Cell. 1990; 63: 835-841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar).Two different isoforms, type I and type II, which are formed by alternative splicing, have been identified in the NF1-GRD region. Type II contains an additional 63-bp insertion (exon 23a) that encodes 21 amino acids in the center of NF1-GRD type I (6Nishi T. Lee P.S. Oka K. Levin V.A. Tanase S. Morino Y. Saya H. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1555-1559PubMed Google Scholar). The specific expression patterns of the two isoforms have been studied in several organs and cells (7Bernards A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1242: 43-59PubMed Google Scholar, 8Metheny L.J. Skuse G.R. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 228: 44-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and provide a basis for implicating differential expression of NF1 type I and type II transcripts in the regulation of neuronal differentiation and development.Recent studies using Nf1 gene targeting animals reported that Drosophila homozygotes with Nf1 null mutation showed significantly decreased olfactory learning performance (9Guo H.F. Tong J. Hannan F. Luo L. Zhong Y. Nature. 2000; 403: 895-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), Nf1 heterozygous mice displayed spatial learning disability (10Silva A.J. Frankland P.W.

Stern J. Ohno M. Kucherlapati R. Jacks T. Silva A.J. Nature. 2002; 415: 526-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar), and mice lacking alternatively spliced Nf1 exon 23a exhibited specific learning impairment (12Costa R.M. Yang T. Huynh D.P. Pulst S.M. Viskochil D.H. Silva A.J. Brannan C.I. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 399-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Furthermore, abnormal Ras activity in Nf1 knockout mice disrupted learning and memory, indicating that functional modulation of Ras by neurofibromin is essential for learning and memory (11Costa R.M. Federov N.B. Kogan J.H. Murphy G.G. Stern J. Ohno M. Kucherlapati R. Jacks T. Silva A.J. Nature. 2002; 415: 526-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). These observations prompted us to postulate that neurofibromin plays a key role in the Ras signal-dependent pathway as a GAP in neuronal cells and that functional regulation of neurofibromin, such as alternative splicing, could be involved in the neuronal development that may be implicated in the learning disability of NF1 patients.Here, we analyzed alterations in cellular neurofibromin GAP activity (NF1-GAP) using a newly developed NF1-GAP assay system during the neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells. PC12 cells are well known to respond to NGF, followed by activation of a Ras-dependent signal pathway, leading to differentiation into a sympathetic neuron-like phenotype (13Vaudry D. Stork P.J. Lazarovici P. Eiden L.E. Science. 2002; 296: 1648-1649Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar, 14Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4822) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that the mutual regulation of Ras and NF1-GAP is implicated in neuronal differentiation. For further confirmation, rat embryonic hippocampal neurons and PC12 cells were analyzed for morphological alterations after overexpression of NF1-GRD type I dominant negative mutants. Finally, we discuss the cellular function of neurofibromin in the normal development of neuronal cells in conjunction with the Ras-related signal modulation via NF1-GAP and implications for the NF1-related neuronal pathogenesis such as learning disability and memory disturbance.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPreparation of Recombinant Proteins—Glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins of human GRD type I (residues 1175–1552), GRD type II (21 amino acids inserted between residues 1345 and 1346 of GRD type I), Ha-Ras, and p120GAP were produced in Escherichia coli under the isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction system, and affinity-purified as described (15Tokuo H. Yunoue S. Feng L. Kimoto M. Tsuji H. Ono T. Saya H. Araki N. FEBS Lett. 2001; 494: 48-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).Construction of Plasmids—pGEX-2TH plasmids harboring NF1-GRD type I and GRD type II cDNAs, which produce GST-GRD type I and GST-GRD type II fusion proteins, respectively, were constructed as described (16Izawa I. Tamaki N. Saya H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). pGEX-2TH-Ha-Ras and pGEX-2T p120GAP were prepared as described (17Kikuchi A. Sasaki T. Araki S. Hata Y. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9133-9136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Li S. Nakamura S. Hattori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19328-19332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). pEGFPc1-GRD type I and type II vectors were constructed by insertion of a HindIII fragment from pGEX-2TH-GRD type I or type II, respectively, into a HindIII site in the pEGFPc-1 multicloning sites and cloned. To construct expression plasmids for FLAG-tagged NF1-GRD type I and type II, NF1-GRD type I and type II DNA fragments were prepared by double digestion of the BglII and XbaI sites of the pEGFPc1-GRD type I and type II plasmids. Each fragment was ligated into the BamHI and XbaI sites of pcDNA3-FLAG, which contained the FLAG epitope DNA sequence in the BamHI-EcoRI sites of pcDNA3 followed by EcoRI-BamHI linker DNA (AATTCGCGGCCGCCCGGG). To construct pcDNA3-Myc-cRaf-1CAAX, a Myc-tagged cRaf-1CAAX fragment was prepared from the pmt-SM-Myc-cRaf-1CAAX plasmid (19Okazaki M. Kishida S. Hinoi T. Hasegawa T. Tamada M. Kataoka T. Kikuchi A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) by double digestion of the NotI and EcoRI sites. The fragment was blunt-ended on the EcoRI site and inserted into the NotI and blunt-ended XbaI sites of pcDNA3 vector. The entire sequences of the plasmids were confirmed using a BigDye Terminator DNA sequence kit (Applied Biosystems) and an ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems).Site-directed Mutagenesis of NF1-GRD Type I—Mutants of pcDNA3-FLAG-GRD type I (R1276K (FLAG-R1276K)) and pcDNA3-FLAG-GRD type I (R1276A/R1391K (FLAG-R1276A/R1391K)) were prepared as described (20Picard V. Ersdal-Badju E. Lu A. Bock S.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2587-2591Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Briefly, pcDNA3-FLAG-GRD type I cDNA was used as a template for PCR amplification with Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene). For the R1276K and R1276A mutations, the primers used were upstream and downstream of the mutation site in R1276 (R1276A-sense, 5′-ACTCTCTTCGCCGGCAACAGCTTGGCCAGTAAAATA-3′; R1276A-antisense, 5′-GCTGTTGCCGGCGAAGAGAGTCTGCATGGAGTCTGC-3′; R1276K-sense, 5′-CAGACTCTCTTCAAAGGCAACAGCTTGGCCAGTAAAATA-3′; R1276K-antisense, 5′-CAAGCTGTTGCCTTTGAAGAGAGTCTGCATGGAGTCTGC-3′). For R1276A/R1391K double mutations, pcDNA3-FLAG R1276A was used as a template, and the primers used were as follows: R1391K-sense, 5′-GCCATGTTCCTCAAATTTATCAATCCTGCCATTGTCTCACCg-3′; R1391K-antisense, 5′-AGGATTGATAAATTTGAGGAACATGGCACTTCCTACTGCACC-3′. The sequences of the mutant plasmids were confirmed by sequencing as described above.Cell Culture, Stimulation, Transfection, and Preparation of Cell Lysates—PC12 cells were cultured under 5% CO2 at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% horse serum and 5% fetal bovine serum. COS7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium nutrient mixture F-12 Ham (Sigma) with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transfection into cells was performed with LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) or Fugene 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. PC12 cells expressing RasN17 (M-M17–26 cells; RIKEN, Saitama, Japan) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 5% horse serum, and 400 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). PC12 cells were stimulated with 50 ng/ml 2.5 S NGF (WAKO) or EGF (WAKO) for up to 48 h. For preparation of cellular lysates, cells were solubilized with NF1 lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, 1 μg/ml each aprotinin, pepstatin A, and leupeptin) and passed through a 25-gauge syringe 15 times. Lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the protein concentrations of the supernatants were determined using the BCA protein assay (Pierce).GAP Activity Assay—To prepare the [γ-32P]GTP-bound form of Ras (Ras-[γ32P]GTP), 40 μl of GST-Ha-Ras (5 μm) was preincubated with 6 μl of [γ-32P]GTP diluted with 5 μm GTP (0.2 mCi/ml) for 2.5 min at 37 °C in 42 μl of Ras loading buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2.5 mg bovine serum albumin). After the incubation, 8 μlof0.5 m MgCl2 and 240 μl of ice-cold Ras loading buffer B (Ras loading buffer A without EDTA) were added. The indicated amounts of GST fusion proteins or cell lysates in 40 μl of GAP assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mg of bovine serum albumin, 5% glycerol, 0.5 mm GTP) in the presence or absence of 3 μg of anti-NF1-GAP IgG were incubated with 10 μl of Ras-[γ-32P]GTP for 10 min at 30 °C. After a second incubation, the reactions were quenched by keeping the sample on ice and adding 0.8 ml of ice-cold stop buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2). The sample was passed through a nitrocellulose filter (0.45 μm; Schleicher & Schuell), and the filter was washed three times with 0.8 ml of ice-cold stop buffer. After drying the filter, the radioactivity was counted. Total GAP activities were obtained from the differences between the total Ras-[γ-32P]GTP radioactivity and the sample radioactivity hydrolyzed after the GAP reaction. Specific NF1-GAP activity was obtained from the difference between the sample radioactivities after the reaction with and without anti-NF1-GAP IgG, and the activity of other GAPs was obtained by subtraction of NF1-GAP activity from the total GAP activity.Ras Activity Assay—The Ras activity assay was performed using the Ras-binding domain of Raf-1 bound to agarose in a Ras activation assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology) according to the manufacturer's instructions and as described (21de Rooij J. Bos J.L. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 623-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar).RT-PCR Analysis of NF1-GRD—For NF1-GRD amplification by RT-PCR, primers 5′-CAGAGTTCCCCTCGCAGCTTCG-3′ (NF1rGRD-sense) and 5′-CTCCGTGCCAAGTCGGAGTTGC-3′ (NF1rGRD-antisense) were used. First-strand cDNA, which served as the PCR template, was synthesized from 2 μg of total RNA purified using an RNeasy minikit (Qiagen) from PC12 cells or M-M17–26 cells. Reverse transcription was performed using oligo(dT) primer and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), and the PCR conditions were as described (8Metheny L.J. Skuse G.R. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 228: 44-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). After PCR, each sample was separated in a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel and stained with ethidium bromide. To quantify the relative expression levels of NF1 type I and type II transcripts, the bands were scanned and analyzed with MacBas2000 (Fuji Film).Antibodies—An anti-NF1-GAP antibody was generated in female Japanese white rabbits immunized against GST-NF1-GRD (amino acids 1175–1552) and affinity-purified on a formylcellulofine column (Seikagaku Co.) covalently coupled with GST-p120GAP protein, followed by a protein G-Sepharose column. A monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (M5) was purchased from Sigma, and anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK and anti-p44/42 MAPK antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology.Neuronal Culture, Transfection, and Immunocytochemistry—Rat hippocampal cell cultures were prepared as described (22Fukunaga K. Soderling T.R. Miyamoto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22527-22533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Neurons separated from rat embryonic day 18–19 hippocampus were plated at high density on coverslips coated with polyethyleneimine (IWAKI). FLAG-R1276A/R1391K was transfected into the neurons with LipofectAMINE 2000 at 12 h after plating. As a control for the morphological analysis, FLAG and GFP vectors were co-transfected and expressed. For morphological studies, neurons were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, aldehyde was quenched in 50 mm ammonium chloride for 5 min, and cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. To identify transfected neurons, cells were immunostained with the monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody M5 (Sigma), followed by a fluorescent dye-conjugated secondary antibody, and analyzed using confocal microscopy (Fluoview, FV500; Olympus). To define the axons and dendrites of neurons, simultaneous immunostaining was performed with a rabbit polyclonal anti-tau antibody (Sigma) and anti-mitogen-activated protein antibody (Sigma), respectively, and the morphological criteria of axons (thin, uniform caliber, nontapering processes) or dendrites (thick, tapering with distant processes) were used. Morphological analysis was performed using the measuring software (Mac SCOPE, Mitani Co.).RESULTSMeasurement of the Specific Ras GAP Activity of Neurofibromin—To analyze the specific GAP function of neurofibromin in neuronal cells, we first established a method for measuring NF1-GAP activity using the anti-NF1-GAP IgG (NF1-GAP Ab), prepared from a rabbit antiserum against GST-NF1-GRD type I depleted of fractions reactive to p120GAP. Immunoblotting using NF1-GAP Ab indicated no cross-reactivity with any cellular proteins other than neurofibromin (Fig. 1F), suggesting its specificity for NF1-GAP. The dose-dependent GAP activities of both GST-NF1-GRD and p120GAP (Fig. 1, A and B) detected by the original filtration assay (23Hattori S. Maekawa M. Nakamura S. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 481-485PubMed Google Scholar) were completely blocked by NF1-GAP Ab, whereas GST-p120GAP was not inhibited (Fig. 1, C and D). We also analyzed the specific effects of NF1-GAP Ab on cellular lysates of Nf1–/– mouse embryo fibroblasts, which had GST-NF1-GRD, p120GAP, or GST proteins added. The GAP activity of GST-NF1-GRD in the Nf1–/– mouse embryo fibroblast extracts was completely inhibited by NF1-GAP Ab to the basal level, but that of p120GAP was not inhibited (Fig. 1E). These results indicate that NF1-GAP Ab specifically inhibits the GAP activity of neurofibromin in cellular extracts, but not p120GAP, and is therefore useful for measurement of cellular specific NF1-GAP. The percentages for the hydrolyzed Ras-[γ-32P]GTP with the reaction of GST-NF1-GRD or the cellular lysates without NF1-GAP Ab were subtracted by those with NF1-GAP Ab and plotted as the specific NF1-GAP activity (Fig. 2, A and B).Fig. 2GAP activities of NF1-GRD type I and type II. A, Ras-[γ-32P]GTP was incubated at 30°C for 10 min with the indicated amounts of GST-NF1-GRD type I (closed circle) or GST-NF1-GRD type II (open circle), and their GAP activities were analyzed. Data are plotted as the GTP hydrolyzed relative to the total GTP bound to Ras in the control without GAP addition. B, GAP activities of cellular lysates (25 μg) from COS7 cells expressing pcDNA3-FLAG vector alone (closed triangle), FLAG-NF1-GRD type I (closed circle), or FLAG-NF1-GRD type II (open circle). The indicated amounts of cell lysates were incubated with NF1-GAP Ab or preimmune IgG for 2 h on ice and analyzed for GAP activity. C, the FLAG protein expression levels in 25 μg of whole cell lysates were detected by immunoblotting using NF1-GAP Ab.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)GAP Activities of NF1 Type I and Type II in Mammalian Cells—The GAP activities of the two alternatively spliced NF1 isoforms, type I and type II, have previously been studied, and it was reported that NF1-GRD type II resulted in a 50% reduction of the GAP activity compared with that of NF1-GRD type I (24Nur E.K.M.S. Varga M. Maruta H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22331-22337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, when we analyzed the GST-NF1-GRD type I and type II GAP activities using our system, GRD type I GAP activity was more than 10-fold higher than that of GRD type II at their lower protein concentrations (ng level of protein) (Fig. 2A). This difference between NF1-GRD type I and type II was reproduced in the cellular GAP analysis of FLAG-tagged NF1-GRD type I (FLAG-NF1-GRD type I) and FLAG-NF1-GRD-type II overexpressed in COS7 cells (Fig. 2B). The expression levels of each FLAG-GRD in 25 μg of cell lysate were almost equal in intensity (Fig. 2C). The activity of GRD type I expressed in COS7 cells in 5 μg of cell lysate was more than 10-fold higher than that of GRD type II. These results suggest that the alternative splicing of NF1 type I and type II regulates cellular NF1-GAP activity and may control the Ras-related signals, such as those for cellular proliferation and differentiation.Relationship of Neurite Outgrowth, Ras Activity, and Endogenous NF1-GAP Activity in PC12 Cells—To study the GAP function of neurofibromin in neuronal cell differentiation, we examined NF1-GAP in PC12 cells after stimulation by several different growth factors. After NGF stimulation, neurite outgrowth occurred in PC12 cells within 24 h, followed by significant neurite extension (Fig. 3B). Neurite outgrowth bearing PC12 cells that carried processes longer than the cell body diameter represented up to 50% of the total cells after 48 h of NGF stimulation (Fig. 3A). In contrast, PC12 cells treated with EGF showed little morphological change, scored less than 2% of neurite outgrowth-bearing cells, and were similar to nontreated cells (Fig. 3, A and B). In the same experiment, the specific NF1-GAP activities of PC12 cells were shown to increase significantly during 12–48 h after NGF stimulation (Fig. 3C). After 48 h, the NF1-GAP activity in NGF-stimulated cells reached 2.5-fold that before stimulation, whereas that of nonstimulated or EGF-stimulated cells only increased 1.25-fold. The activity of other GAPs obtained after subtraction of the specific NF1-GAP activity from the total GAP activity showed a small increase after NGF stimulation but stayed at a lower level compared with the NF1-GAP activity (50% increase in other GAPs versus 180% increase in NF1-GAP compared with each GAP in the nonstimulated state). The effect of EGF stimulation on the activity of other GAPs was also insignificant and as low as the effect on NF1-GAP (Fig. 3D). Cellular NF1-GAP activity also increased in a dose-dependent manner with NGF stimulation (data not shown), indicating that NF1-GAP activity is responsive to NGF stimulation.Fig. 3Time-dependent effects of NGF and EGF stimulation on NF1-GAP and neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells. PC12 cells were plated on collagen type I-coated dishes and cultured with NGF or EGF or without a growth factor for the indicated periods and examined. A, PC12 cells that carried processes longer than the cell body diameter were scored as neurite outgrowth-bearing cells cultured with NGF (closed circle) or EGF (open circle). Data represent means ± S.D. in 200 cells from two experiments. B, time-dependent effects of NGF and EGF on neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells. Cell morphology was analyzed at the indicated times after the incubation. C, time-dependent increases in NF1-GAP activity in PC12 cells during NGF or EGF stimulation. PC12 cells were lysed with 100 μl of NF1 lysis buffer and incubated with 3 μg of NF1-GAP Ab or preimmune IgG for 3 h on ice, and the GAP activities were analyzed. GAP activities in NGF-treated (closed circles), EGF-treated (open circles), and untreated control (closed triangles) cells were plotted, with the converted amounts for GST-NF1-GRD type I being equivalent to their activity in 25 μg of total cellular proteins. Data represent means ± S.D. from four experiments performed in duplicate. D, NF1-GAP (NF1) or other GAPs (other) activity in PC12 cells after treatment with NGF or EGF or without a growth factor (GF(–)) for 48 h. The activity of other GAPs was calculated as follows: (total GAP activity) – (NF1-GAP activity). Each GAP activity is expressed as the -fold increase over that at 0 h. Data represent means ± S.D. from four experiments performed in duplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Cellular Ras activity was analyzed using an affinity technique with Raf-1RBD (Ras-binding domain)-agarose. After NGF stimulation, Ras activity quickly reached the maximum level within 5 min and was down-regulated during 15–60 min (Fig. 4, A and B), as reported previously (25Kao S. Jaiswal R.K. Kolch W. Landreth G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18169-18177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, upon further stimulation with NGF, Ras activity gradually increased up to more than 10-fold the original level, reached a plateau at around 24 h, and was then down-regulated over 24–72-h stimulation (Fig. 4, A and C). EGF stimulation increased Ras activity quickly and down-regulated it during an early phase in the same manner as NGF stimulation. However, later than 60 min after EGF stimulation, Ras activity regulated at the basal level did not change over 72-h stimulation (Fig. 4, A–C). The Ras activity regulation in PC12 cells in the later phase of NGF stimulation was well correlated with the time-dependent increase in cellular NF1-GAP activity as well as with the increase in neurite-bearing PC12 cells (Fig. 3, A and C). Thus, these results prompted us to speculate that the increase in endogenous NF1-GAP activity in PC12 cells may regulate cellular Ras activity and control neuronal outgrowth of PC12 cells during longer NGF stimulation.Fig. 4Time-dependent effects of NGF and EGF stimulation on Ras activities in PC12 cells. A, Ras activities in PC12 cells at the early (0–180 min) and later (12–72 h) phases of NGF (upper panel) or EGF (lower panel) treatment. After culture with NGF or EGF for the indicated periods, Ras activities were analyzed.

Interestingly, the transcriptional levels of both the type I and type II isoforms increased after NGF exposure in a time-dependent fashion, but the rate of increase of type I mRNA was significantly higher than that of type II (Figs. 5A and 6, A and B). Before exposure to NGF, the type I/type II transcript ratio was 22%, but after NGF stimulation, it gradually increased in a time-dependent manner, and after 48 h, the ratio was up to 110% (Figs. 5B and 6C). In contrast, EGF stimulation did not increase the type I/type II ratio, even after 48-h stimulation (Fig. 5, A and B), suggesting that the specific splicing of NF1 type I/type II mRNA could be induced by cellular signals via NGF stimulation in particular. The pattern of the time-dependent increase for type I/type II transcription was very similar t"

To further understand this process, we analyzed the alteration of transcript profiles along the time course of CD40 ligand-induced maturation of human myeloid DCs by Affymetrix GeneChip microarrays covering >6800 genes. Besides rediscovery of genes already described as associated with DC maturation proving reliability of the methods used, we identified clusterin as novel maturation marker. Looking across the time course, we observed synchronized kinetics of distinct functional groups of molecules whose temporal coregulation underscores known cellular events during dendritic cell maturation. For example, an early-peaking wave of inflammatory chemokines was followed by a sustained increase of constitutive chemokines and accompanied by slow but continuous induction of survival proteins. After an immediate but transient induction of cytokine-responsive transcripts, there was an increased expression of a group of genes involved in not only the regulation of cytokine effects, but also of transcription in general. Our results demonstrate that microarray studies along time courses combined with real-time PCR not only discover new marker molecules with functional implications, but also dissect the molecular kinetics of biological processes identifying complex pathways of regulation."

Like other known herpesviruses, HHV-6 encodes multiple glycoproteins, several of which have been implicated in the entry process. In this report, we present evidence that glycoprotein H (gH) is the viral component responsible for binding to CD46. Antibodies to CD46 co-immunoprecipitated an ∼110-kDa protein band specifically associated with HHV-6-infected cells. This protein was identified as gH by selective depletion with an anti-gH monoclonal antibody, as well as by immunoblot analysis with a rabbit hyperimmune serum directed against a gH synthetic peptide. In reciprocal experiments, a monoclonal antibody against HHV-6 gH was found to co-immunoprecipitate CD46. Studies using monoclonal antibodies directed against specific CD46 domains, as well as engineered constructs lacking defined CD46 regions, demonstrated a close correspondence between the CD46 domains involved in the interaction with gH and those previously shown to be critical for HHV-6 fusion (i.e. short consensus repeats 2 and 3).

J. Med. Microbiol. 2003; 52: 5-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Two major HHV-6 variants, A and B, have been defined that form two segregated clusters with unique genetic, biologic, and immunologic characteristics. Primary infection with HHV-6 B occurs almost universally in early childhood and has been etiologically linked to exanthema subitum. In adult life, HHV-6 infection and/or reactivation have been associated with a wide range of diseases, including multiple sclerosis, but most of these associations have yet to be substantiated by rigorous epidemiological studies. In immunocompromised people, including those infected with human immunodeficiency virus, HHV-6 B has been implicated as an opportunistic agent that may cause life-threatening respiratory tract and central nervous system infections, as well as bone marrow or organ graft failure. Moreover, HHV-6 may act as a cofactor to accelerate progression of human immunodeficiency virus disease. The best studied members of the herpesvirus family enter cells by direct fusion with the plasma membrane in a process involving binding of viral glycoproteins to specific protein receptors on the target cell (reviewed in Ref. 2Spear P.G. Eisenberg R.J. Cohen G.H. Virology. 2000; 275: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Fusion is also facilitated by virus interactions with cell surface glycosaminoglycans. Recently, we identified CD46 (membrane cofactor protein) as a cellular receptor mediating fusion and entry for both HHV-6 variants (3Santoro F. Kennedy P.E. Locatelli G. Malnati M.S. Berger E.A. Lusso P. Cell. 1999; 99: 817-827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). This glycoprotein also serves as a cellular receptor mediating critical events in the infectious process of other human pathogens, including binding/fusion/entry of measles virus, pilus binding of different pathogenic Neisseriae, and adhesion of group A Streptococci (reviewed in Ref. 4Hourcade D. Liszewski M.K. Krych-Goldberg M. Atkinson J.P. Immunopharmacology. 2000; 49: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). CD46 is a member of the regulators of complement activation (RCA) protein family. It is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein of 45–67 kDa, expressed on most or all human nucleated cell types. The N-terminal region consists of four partially homologous short consensus repeats (SCRs) linked in tandem; the SCRs are followed by a serine-threonine-proline (STP)-rich domain, a short region of unknown function, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail. Four distinct CD46 isoforms are variably expressed on different cell types; these contain the same SCRs but differ in the STP and cytoplasmic domains as a result of alternative RNA splicing. Recently the CD46 determinants required for HHV-6 fusion have been analyzed; our results indicated that the critical determinants reside within SCRs 2 and 3, but not SCRs 1 or 4 (5Greenstone H.L. Santoro F. Lusso P. Berger E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39112-39118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), whereas another study suggested involvement of SCRs 2–4 (6Mori Y. Seya T. Huang H.L. Akkapaiboon P. Dhepakson P. Yamanishi K. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 6750-6761Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). By contrast, the critical CD46 domains are SCRs 1 and 2 for measles virus, SCR3 and the STP regions for Neisseria gonorrhoeae, SCRs 3 and 4 for group A Streptococcus (4Hourcade D. Liszewski M.K. Krych-Goldberg M. Atkinson J.P. Immunopharmacology. 2000; 49: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). HHV-6 encodes multiple surface glycoproteins, including gB, gH, gL, and gM (1Dockrell D.H. J. Med. Microbiol. 2003; 52: 5-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), for which relatively conserved homologs have been identified in all known mammalian herpesviruses. Of these, gH and gL appear to play prominent roles in the membrane fusion events that initiate HHV-6 infectivity, based on inhibitory activities of specific antibodies (7Foà-Tomasi L. Boscaro A.

As in other herpesviruses, these glycoproteins form a heterodimeric complex, with gL being required for correct folding, intracellular maturation, and surface expression of gH (9Liu D.X. Gompels U.A.

Moreover, gB (the most highly conserved glycoprotein among herpesviruses) and another glycoprotein, gp82-gp105, (thus far found only in HHV-6 and the related β-herpesvirus, HHV-7) appear to be critical for the fusion/entry process, as specific antibodies against these proteins block both virus infectivity and syncytia formation (17Takeda K. Okuno T. Isegawa Y. Yamanishi K. Virology. 1996; 222: 176-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 18Pfeiffer B. Thomson B. Chandran B. J.

Recently the gp82-gp105 glycoprotein has been shown to be associated with gH-gL complexes in infected cells and virions, and the designation gQ was proposed (20Mori Y. Akkapaiboon P. Yang X.W. Yamanishi K. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 2452-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). At present, the precise roles of individual HHV-6 glycoproteins and their possible interplay in the infection process remain poorly understood. In the present study, we sought to identify the HHV-6 glycoprotein(s) that directly interacts with the cellular receptor CD46. Using complementary co-immunoprecipitation approaches, we identified the gH glycoprotein as the CD46-binding component of HHV-6. Mapping studies demonstrated that the CD46 determinants critical for gH binding reside in SCR2 and SCR3, consistent with our previous study (5Greenstone H.L. Santoro F. Lusso P. Berger E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39112-39118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) indicating the importance of the same CD46 domains for HHV-6 fusion. Cells and Culture Conditions—Primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were derived from Leukopak preparations obtained from healthy adult donors by gradient centrifugation (Bio-Whittaker, Walkersville, MD). NIH 3T3 (mouse embryo fibroblasts), RK13 (rabbit kidney cells), and HSB-2 (human immature T-lymphoid cells) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. NIH 3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and 10 μg/ml gentamicin). RK13 cells were maintained in EMEM-10 (Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and 10 μg/ml gentamicin). HSB-2 cells and PBMC were maintained in suspension in RPMI-10 (RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and 10 μg/ml gentamicin). Cultures were maintained in a humidified tissue culture incubator at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Virus and Infection Procedure—HHV-6 variant A (strain GS) was first propagated in adult human PBMC followed by co-culturing with HSB-2 cells as described (5Greenstone H.L. Santoro F. Lusso P. Berger E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39112-39118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Briefly, 20 × 106 PBMC were cultured for 3 days at 2 × 106 cells/ml in RPMI-10 plus 5 μg/ml of phytohemagglutinin (Sigma). Activated cells were centrifuged at 300 × g for 10 min, resuspended in 2 ml of RPMI-10, and infected by incubation for 2 h at 37 °C with cell-free virus stock at an approximate multiplicity of infection of 0.5. The cells were subsequently diluted to 1 × 106 cells/ml and cultured in RPMI-10 for 6–8 days until cytopathic effects were observed. HSB-2 cells were infected with HHV-6 GS by co-cultivation with infected PBMC at a ratio of 5:1. For vaccinia virus infection, NIH 3T3 or RK13 cells were detached by trypsinization, resuspended at 1 × 107 cells per ml in EMEM with 2.5% fetal bovine serum (EMEM-2.5), and infected with wild-type vaccinia virus Western Reserve (WR) or with recombinant vaccinia virus vCB-48 encoding the BC2 isoform of human CD46 (21Nussbaum O. Broder C.C. Moss B. Stern L.B.L. Rozenblatt S. Berger E.A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3341-3349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) at a multiplicity of infection of 10. After a 2-h incubation at 37 °C, the cells were diluted to 5 × 105 cells/ml in EMEM-2.5 and incubated overnight at 31 °C to allow CD46 expression. Plasmids and Transfection Procedure—Transfection protocols were performed in EMEM-2.5. Briefly, monolayers of RK13 were singly transfected with plasmids encoding either wild type CD46 (21Nussbaum O. Broder C.C. Moss B. Stern L.B.L. Rozenblatt S. Berger E.A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3341-3349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or one of the following variants (5Greenstone H.L. Santoro F. Lusso P.

Virol. 2000; 81: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) (generously provided by Denis Gerlier, CNRS, Lyon, France) in which the SCR3 or SCR4 domains of CD46 were replaced with SCR3 and SCR4 domains of decay accelerating factor (DAF), respectively. All the recombinant CD46 sequences were cloned into pSC59, which contains a strong synthetic vaccinia promoter (24Chakrabarti S. Sisler J.R. Moss B. Biotechniques. 1997; 23: 1094-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). As a parallel negative control, cells were transfected with the pSC59 empty vector. The transfection procedure was carried out with DOTAP transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). After4hat37 °C the transfected cells were detached by trypsinization, infected with vaccinia WR, and incubated overnight at 31 °C as described above. Immunological Reagents—Immunoprecipitation reactions were performed with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). The following mAbs against human CD46 were used (at 25 μg/ml): J4.48 (25Pesando J.M. Stucki M. Hoffman P. Hum. Immunol. 1987; 19: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and E4.3 (26Purcell D.F.J. Deacon N.J. Mckenzie I.F.C. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1989; 67: 279-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) to SCR1, purchased from Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, respectively; mAbs M177 to CD46 SCR2 and M160 to CD46 SCR3 (27Seya T. Hara T. Matsumoto M. Akedo H. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 238-245PubMed Google Scholar), kindly provided by Tsukasa Seya, Osaka Medical Center, Osaka, Japan; and mAb GB24, which recognizes SCR4 (Ref. 28Cho S.W. Oglesby T.J. Hsi B.L. Adams E.M. Atkinson J.P. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1991; 83: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar and unpublished data). The following mAbs against HHV-6 glycoproteins were employed: anti-HHV-6 gp116/64/54 against gB (used at 25 μg/ml), purchased from ABI, Columbia, MD, and mAbs 7A2 against gH (ascites fluid, used at 1:2000 dilution) and 2D6 against gp82-gp105 (tissue culture supernatant, used at 1:4 dilution) (29Balachandran N. Amelse R.E. Zhou W.W. Chang C.K. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 2835-2840Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (kindly donated by Dr. Bala Chandran, University of Kansas). The negative control mAb HA.11 to influenza hemagglutinin (30Field J. Nikawa J. Broek D. Macdonald B. Rodgers L. Wilson I.A. Lerner R.A. Wigler M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2159-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar) (used at 25 μg/ml) was purchased from Covance (Princeton, NJ). For immunoblot analysis, rabbit polyclonal primary antibodies were employed. For CD46 detection, antibody H-294 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. For gH detection, a hyperimmune rabbit antiserum was raised against a short peptide spanning the amino terminus of HHV-6A gH from amino acid 79 to amino acid 93 (sequence: ESLTNYEKRVTRFYE). The N-acetylated synthetic peptide linked to keyhole limpet hemacyanin was used for rabbit immunization (Sigma Genosys, The Woodlands, TX). As the secondary antibody, donkey anti-rabbit immunoglobulin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) was employed. Co-immunoprecipitation Experiments—Co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed either with metabolically labeled cells coupled with autoradiographic detection or with unlabeled cells using immunoblot analysis. In the labeling protocol, HHV-6-infected HSB-2 cells at 3 days postinfection were washed twice with methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and resuspended at 5 × 105 cells/ml with methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum and 40 μCi/ml of [35S]methionine; uninfected HSB-2 cells were labeled in parallel as a negative control. After a 20-h culture at 37 °C, the cells were washed and suspended in methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Mixtures were prepared containing 1 × 106-labeled HSB-2 cells and 1 × 106 unlabeled cells (NIH 3T3 or RK13) expressing vaccinia-encoded CD46 (wild type or variants) in a total volume of 200 μl and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The cells were washed in cold PBS and solubilized in 200 μl of lysis buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, and 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100. Cell lysates were incubated on ice for 20 min, and cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 24,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The lysates were precleared by adding 50 μl of goat anti-mouse IgG agarose (Sigma) and incubating overnight at 4 °C with rotation. Co-immunoprecipitation from the precleared lysates was performed by adding the indicated anti-CD46 mAb (at 25 μg/ml), incubating for 2 h at 4 °C, adding 50 μl of goat anti-mouse IgG agarose, and incubating for4hat4 °C with rotation. The agarose beads were washed four times with 1 ml of lysis buffer; SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol was added, and the samples were heated for 5 min at 95 °C. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 4–20% gradient gels (Invitrogen) and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Protran, Schleicher & Schuell, Keene, NH); immunoprecipitated proteins were detected by autoradiography. Where indicated, direct immunoprecipitation from the metabolically labeled lysate was performed by using a mAb against the designated HHV-6 glycoprotein and processing the samples as described above. For studies involving immunodepletion of specific metabolically labeled HHV-6 glycoproteins, the supernatants recovered from the first immunoprecipitations with the anti-glycoprotein mAbs were subjected to a second identical immunoprecipitation reaction. Only minimal amounts of the glycoproteins were precipitated by the second reaction (data not shown), thus verifying the efficacy of the immunodepletion. The supernatants recovered after immunodepletion were incubated with goat anti-mouse agarose to remove any remaining antibodies and then subjected to co-immunoprecipitation with an anti-CD46 mAb as described above. For the experiments involving detection of unlabeled proteins by immunoblotting, preparation of cell lysates, co-immunoprecipitation reactions, and SDS-PAGE were performed as described above. The resolved proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, which were then blocked by a 1-h incubation with PBS/0.1% Tween-20 containing 10% milk. The membranes were then washed and incubated with the designated polyclonal antiserum (see above) in PBS/0.1% Tween-20 containing 5% milk. Rabbit antiserum against the gH peptide was used at a 1:700 dilution; rabbit antiserum to CD46 (H-294) was used at a 1:1000 dilution. After a 1-h incubation, the membranes were washed three times with PBS/0.1% Tween-20 and incubated for 1 h with donkey anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase in PBS/0.1% Tween-20 (dilution 1:5000). After three washes the membranes were subjected to enhanced chemiluminescence detection using the Supersignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Co-immunoprecipitation of Human CD46 with HHV-6-associated Proteins—To identify the HHV-6 protein(s) interacting with CD46, co-immunoprecipitation studies were performed to test the ability of the cellular receptor to form a stable complex with proteins expressed in HHV-6-infected cells. Mouse fibroblasts (NIH 3T3) were infected with a recombinant vaccinia virus encoding full-length human CD46 (BC2 isoform). These cells were mixed with [35S]methionine-labeled human immature T-lymphoid cells (HSB-2) productively infected with HHV-6, strain GS (variant A). Flow cytometry verified surface expression of HHV-6 glycoproteins (gH, gp82–105, and gB). The cell mixture was lysed and subjected to immunoprecipitation with an anti-human CD46 mAb (J4–48); this mAb is specific for the SCR1 domain, which is dispensable for HHV-6 fusion (5Greenstone H.L. Santoro F. Lusso P. Berger E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39112-39118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 6Mori Y. Seya T. Huang H.L. Akkapaiboon P. Dhepakson P. Yamanishi K. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 6750-6761Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates were resolved by reducing SDS-PAGE as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 1A, a major radiolabeled band of ∼110 kDa was co-precipitated with anti-CD46 (lane 2); this band was absent from a control reaction using uninfected HSB-2 cells (lane 1), as well as from another control using CD46-negative NIH 3T3 cells (lanes 3 and 4). The latter result demonstrates that it was the recombinant CD46 from the NIH 3T3 cells rather than the endogenous CD46 from the infected HSB-2 cells that mediated the co-immunoprecipitation. Several minor bands were also observed under all conditions and thus were interpreted as background. Further specificity is illustrated in Fig. 1B, which demonstrates that the ∼110-kDa band was not co-immunoprecipitated by an isotype control mAb HA.11 directed against influenza virus hemagglutinin. Taken together, these results demonstrate that human CD46 interacts with a protein specific for HHV-6-infected cells. The electrophoretic mobility of this protein is consistent with that reported for glycoprotein H (gH) (100–110 kDa, Refs. 9Liu D.X. Gompels U.A. Foà-Tomasi L. Campadelli-Fiume G.

Depletion of the CD46-interacting ∼110-kDa Protein with an Anti-gH mAb—To assess whether the ∼110-kDa band was gH, we tested whether depletion of the supernatant with an anti-gH mAb would result in loss of this band upon subsequent co-immunoprecipitation with anti-CD46. We also examined the effects of depleting two other HHV-6 glycoproteins, gp82-gp105 and gB; all three glycoproteins are known to play critical roles in viral infectivity, as shown by the neutralizing activities of specific antibodies to gH (7Foà-Tomasi L.

J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4611-4620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We first analyzed the products of direct immunoprecipitation from the lysate of a mixture of HHV-6-infected HSB-2 cells and CD46-expressing NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 2A). As expected, the anti-gH mAb (7A2) precipitated a major band of ∼110 kDa, which was not observed with the other mAbs. The anti-gp82-gp105 mAb (2D6) precipitated a major protein band of ∼80 kDa as well as several minor bands of various sizes, consistent with previous analyses of gp82-gp105 (18Pfeiffer B. Thomson B. Chandran B. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3490-3500Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Balachandran N. Amelse R.E. Zhou W.W. Chang C.K. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 2835-2840Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The anti-gB mAb (anti-HHV-6 gp 116/64/54) precipitated three major proteins of ∼120, 64, and 54 kDa, consistent with previous analyses of gB (17Takeda K. Okuno T. Isegawa Y. Yamanishi K. Virology. 1996; 222: 176-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 29Balachandran N. Amelse R.E. Zhou W.W. Chang C.K. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 2835-2840Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We then analyzed the lysates that had been depleted of specific HHV-6 glycoproteins for co-immunoprecipitation with anti-CD46. With the gH-depleted lysate, the ∼110-kDa band was no longer observed, in contrast with the results for the non-depleted supernatants shown above (Fig. 1). However, in both the gp82-gp105-depleted and the gB-depleted lysates, the ∼110-kDa band was still observed. These results indicate that all of the detected radiolabeled protein specifically co-immunoprecipitated with anti-CD46 was specifically recognized by the anti-gH mAb. Confirmation of gH Binding to CD46 by Reciprocal Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—As an additional approach to test for a possible interaction between gH and CD46, we examined the ability of mAbs against one protein to co-immunoprecipitate the other from mixtures of unlabeled HHV-6-infected and CD46-expressing cells; immunoblotting with specific polyclonal antisera was used to detect the co-immunoprecipitated proteins. In Fig. 3A, the J4.48 anti-CD46 mAb was used for the initial immunoprecipitation, and a rabbit antiserum prepared against a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 79–93 of gH from HHV-6 strain U1102 (variant A) was used for detection of gH (the specific reactivity of this antiserum for gH was verified by immunoblotting; data not shown). A single prominent ∼110-kDa band was observed. This band was absent from a negative control immunoprecipitate from a mixture lacking CD46-expressing cells, thereby verifying that the gH co-immunoprecipitation was mediated by the recombinant CD46 from the 3T3 cells rather than the endogenous CD46 from the HSB-2 cells. This experiment verifies that gH is co-immunoprecipitated with anti-CD46. A reciprocal experiment was performed to test whether mAbs against different HHV-6 glycoproteins could co-immunoprecipitate CD46 from a lysate of HHV-6-infected HSB-2 cells mixed with recombinant CD46-expressing NIH 3T3 cells. Fig. 3B shows that two broad CD46 bands of ∼67 and 50 kDa were co-immunoprecipitated by the anti-gH mAb, similar to the profile of bands directly immunoprecipitated by an anti-CD46 mAb. These bands were absent in a control experiment with NIH 3T3 cells lacking recombinant CD46 (data not shown), again demonstrating that they represented the recombinant CD46 rather than endogenous CD46 on the HSB-2 cells. The sizes of the two CD46 bands are consistent with the previously described processing of the high mannose-containing precursor (lower band) to the mature product (upper band) (31Liszewski M.K. Tedja I. Atkinson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10776-10779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These two bands were previously observed for vaccinia-encoded CD46 (21Nussbaum O. Broder C.C. Moss B. Stern L.B.L. Rozenblatt S. Berger E.A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3341-3349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and presumably reflect incomplete processing under conditions of vaccinia-mediated overexpression. Importantly, Fig. 3B also shows that the co-immunoprecipitation of CD46 was specific for gH, because it was not observed with the anti-gB mAb or the anti-gp82-gp105 mAb. Correlation between the CD46 Domains Involved in gH Binding and HHV-6 Fusion—In our previous report (5Greenstone H.L. Santoro F. Lusso P. Berger E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39112-39118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) on the CD46 regions required for HHV-6-mediated cell fusion, a critical role was observed for the two central SCR domains, SCR2 and SCR3. To test for a possible relationship between these two regions of CD46 and the co-immunoprecipitation of gH, two types of experiments were performed. Fig. 4A shows gH co-immunoprecipitation studies performed using mAbs directed against each of the four SCR domains of CD46. Marked differences were observed (Fig. 4A, upper panel): co-immunoprecipitation occurred with the mAbs directed against SCR1 or SCR4 but not with those directed against SCR2 or SCR3. This distinction was noted despite the ability of all the mAbs to directly immunoprecipitate CD46 (Fig. 4A, lower panel). As a complementary approach, we tested gH co-immunoprecipitation by variant CD46 constructs differing in their SCR domain compositions. RK13 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding either wild-type CD46, CD46 delet"

Here we show that internal deletion of 20 amino acids corresponding to the highly conserved CIRB region results in the loss of diacylglycerol and agonist-mediated channel activation in HEK293 cells. By using confocal microscopy to examine the cellular localization of Topaz fluorescent protein fusion constructs, we demonstrate that this loss in activity is caused by faulty targeting of CIRB-deleted mutants to intracellular compartments. Wild type TRPC3 and mutants lacking a C-terminal predicted coiled coil region downstream of CIRB were targeted to the plasma membrane correctly in HEK293 cells and exhibited TRPC3-mediated calcium entry in response to agonist activation. Mutation of conserved YQ and MKR motifs to alanine within the CIRB region in TRPC3-Topaz, which would be expected to interfere with IP3 receptor and/or calmodulin binding, had no effect on channel function or targeting. Additionally, TRPC3 targets to the plasma membrane of DT40 cells lacking all three IP3 receptors and forms functional ion channels. These findings indicate that the previously identified CIRB region of TRPC3 is involved in its targeting to the plasma membrane by a mechanism that does not involve interaction with IP3 receptors.

These findings indicate that the previously identified CIRB region of TRPC3 is involved in its targeting to the plasma membrane by a mechanism that does not involve interaction with IP3 receptors. Calcium entry in nonexcitable cells is most commonly triggered by the activation of a receptor stimulating phospholipase C to cleave phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate into diacylglycerol (DAG), 1The abbreviations used are: DAG, diacylglycerol; TRPC, canonical transient receptor potential; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; OAG, 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol; CIRB, calmodulin/IP3 receptor-binding; CaM, calmodulin; EYFP, enhanced yellow fluorescent protein.1The abbreviations used are: DAG, diacylglycerol; TRPC, canonical transient receptor potential; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; OAG, 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol; CIRB, calmodulin/IP3 receptor-binding; CaM, calmodulin; EYFP, enhanced yellow fluorescent protein. which stimulates protein kinase C, and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), which binds to the IP3 receptor to release calcium from intracellular stores (1Berridge M.J. Irvine R.F. Nature. 1989; 341: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (3288) Google Scholar). TRPC3, a member of the transient receptor potential family of ion channels, has been shown to be activated by agonist activation of plasma membrane G-protein-coupled receptors, by synthetic diacylglycerols, and by store depletion in some cell types (2Birnbaumer L. Zhu X. Jiang M. Boulay G. Peyton M. Vannier B. Brown D. Platano D. Sadeghi H. Stefani E. Birnbaumer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A conformational coupling model physically linking TRPC3 with the IP3 receptor has been suggested, and a region in the cytosolic C terminus of TRPC3 has been shown to co-immunoprecipitate with regions of the IP3 receptor (5Kiselyov K. Xu X. Mozhayeva G. Kuo T. Pessah I. Mignery G. Zhu X. Birnbaumer L. Muallem S. Nature. 1998; 396: 478-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 6Kiselyov K. Mignery G.A. Zhu M.X. Muallem S. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 423-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). An overlapping region of TRPC3 binds to calmodulin (CaM), which is hypothesized to be tethered to the channel and to be displaced competitively by the activated IP3 receptor; the region that commonly binds both IP3 receptor and calmodulin has been termed the calmodulin/IP3 receptor-binding (CIRB) region (7Zhang Z. Tang J. Tikunova S. Johnson J.D. Chen Z. Qin N. Dietrich A. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Zhu M.X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3168-3173Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). However, binding of CaM to the isolated CaM-binding region of TRPC3 is dependent on the calcium concentration, which is inconsistent with a model of CaM being tethered to the channel independently of the calcium concentration. Calmodulin binding to a CIRB homologous region in all members of the TRPC family (TRPC1–7) has been demonstrated (8Tang J. Lin Y. Zhang Z. Tikunova S. Birnbaumer L. Zhu M.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21303-21310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). A second CaM-binding region has been identified in other TRPs. For TRPC4, CaM binds in a region unique to the splice variant TRPC4α, which is not present in the splice variant TRPC4β (8Tang J. Lin Y. Zhang Z. Tikunova S. Birnbaumer L. Zhu M.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21303-21310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 9Trost C. Bergs C. Himmerkus N. Flockerzi V. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 663-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This region has also been shown to interact with the C terminus of IP3 receptors in a yeast two-hybrid screen and glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays (10Mery L. Magnino F. Schmidt K. Krause K.-H. FEBS Lett. 2001; 487: 377-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Binding to both CaM-binding domains of TRPC4 occurs only above 10 μm Ca2+ with an apparent K d of 100–200 nm CaM (9Trost C. Bergs C. Himmerkus N. Flockerzi V. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 663-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). For TRPC1 a second CaM-binding domain has also been reported that overlaps with a predicted coiled coil region common to the C terminus of all TRPCs (11Singh B.B. Liu X. Tang J. Zhu M.X. Ambudkar I.S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 739-750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). This second CaM-binding region has been shown to be involved in calcium-dependent inactivation of TRPC1 (11Singh B.B. Liu X. Tang J. Zhu M.X. Ambudkar I.S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 739-750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Our goal was to identify functional roles of the CIRB and other domains of TRPC3 using N- and C-terminal truncation mutants of TRPC3. Plasmid Construction—TRPC3 (provided by Lutz Birnbaumer, NIEHS, National Institutes of Health), hemagglutinin-tagged at the C terminus via an AscI site in pcDNA3, was used as a template for the construction of truncation mutants (TRPC3NΔ1–TRPC3NΔ3 and TRPC3CΔ4–TRPC3CΔ8). For N-terminal truncation mutants (TRPC3NΔ1–TRPC3NΔ3), the sequence preceding the desired start site was changed to a BamHI site followed by an ATG using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit. To remove the 5′ sequence including the original ATG, cDNAs were digested with BamHI, which has a recognition sequence in the multicloning box of pcDNA3 5′ of the insert and at the newly introduced site, and religated. For C-terminal truncation mutants (TRPC3ΔC4–TRPC3ΔC8), an NheI site was introduced into the sequence (GCTAGC) with the TAG stop codon positioned at the designated end of the coding region. For TRPC3-Topaz fusion constructs (T3T), a TRPC3 construct fused to the brighter YFP version Topaz at the C terminus via an AscI restriction site was used as a template (12Tsien R.Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 509-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (4839) Google Scholar). For N-terminal truncation mutants (T3T-NΔ0 and T3T-NΔ1), the same strategy as described for untagged mutants was used. For C-terminal deletions (T3T-CΔ7 and T3T-CΔ8), the AscI recognition site 3′ of the stop codon was mutated keeping the AscI site fusing TrpC3 to Topaz intact. An AscI site was introduced into the sequence at the desired site of truncation of TrpC3. The mutants were digested with AscI and religated to yield truncated TrpC3-Topaz fusions. For the internal deletion mutant T3T-CΔ78 oligonucleotides 5′-cagcattctcaatcagggatccatgtatcagcagataatgaaaag and 5′-cttttcattatctgctgatacatggatccctgattgagaatgctg were used in the mutagenesis reaction with Trp3-Topaz as template. Cell Culture and Transfection—For the production of pools of cells stably expressing wild type and mutant TRPC3, HEK293 cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE2000® at ∼80% confluency according to the manufacturer's instructions. The day after transfection the cells were split into selection medium containing 0.5 mg/ml G418 and grown for 4 weeks in the continued presence of selection medium. In parallel, control cells transfected only with the fluorescent marker pdsRedmito were selected for G418 resistance as above, and pdsRedmito expression was confirmed by their red fluorescence (excitation, 558 nm; emission, 610 nm). The chicken B lymphocyte cell line DT40 and the mutant variant in which the genes for all three IP3 receptor types were disrupted were obtained from the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research (RIKEN; Cell Bank code RCB1464 and RCB1467). The cells were cultured essentially as described by Sugawara et al. (13Sugawara H. Kurosaki M. Takata M. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3078-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). DT40 were transiently transfected by electroporation (14Vazquez G. Lièvremont J.-P. Bird G.St.J. Putney Jr., J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11777-11782Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) with the indicated amounts of the human isoform of TRPC3 or deletion variants or its vector (pcDNA3), along with EYFP-C1 vector (Clontech) as a marker for transfection. The cells were co-transfected with the human M5 muscarinic receptor (50 μg/ml, in pcDNA3). The cells were assayed 17–25 h post-transfection. The fluorescence measurements were performed under the conditions indicated with single enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP)-positive cells, selected by their yellow/green fluorescence (excitation, 485 nm; emission, 520 nm). Under the conditions of measurement, EYFP expression did not contribute significant fluorescence. Flow Cytometry—Pools of G418-resistant cells expressing wild type or mutant T3T were subjected to flow cytometric analysis to enrich for cells with high expression levels of fluorescent protein fusions. The cells were treated with trypsin and analyzed on a FACSVantageSE flow cytometer equipped with Cell Quest software (Becton-Dickinson, San Jose, CA). Fluorescence was assayed using an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and an emission wavelength of 530 nm. Calcium Measurement—Intracellular calcium concentration was measured with a real time fluorescence plate reader system (FLIPR-384; Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA); the cells were plated in poly-d-lysine-coated, black-walled 96-well plates at ∼30–40% confluency and incubated overnight at 37 °C to allow attachment of the cells. The cells were loaded for 90 min at 37 °C with 4 μm Fluo4-AM and washed twice with nominally calcium free buffer (20 mm HEPES, 120 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 0.8 mm MgCl2, 11.1 mm glucose, pH 7.4). GdCl3, methacholine, and CaCl2 at final concentrations of 1 μm, 100 μm, and 1.8 mm, respectively, were added at the time points indicated in the figure. For measurement of 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (OAG) activation, the cells were loaded with Fluo4-AM as described above and washed twice with calcium containing buffer (20 mm HEPES, 120 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 0.8 mm MgCl2, 11.1 mm glucose, pH 7.4, 1.8 mm Ca2+). OAG (final concentration, 100 μm) in calcium-containing buffer was added at the indicated times. The fluorescent dye was excited with an argon laser at 488 nm, and the resultant emitted light (540 nm) was detected by a cooled CCD camera. When representative traces are shown, they are averages of multiple wells within an experiment, and each experiment was repeated at least three times with similar results. For fluorescence measurements of DT40 cells, the fluorescence intensity of multiple Fura-2-loaded EYFP-positive cells or EYFP-negative control cells was monitored with a CCD camera-based imaging system (Universal Imaging) mounted on a Zeiss Axiovert 35 inverted microscope equipped with a Zeiss 40× (1.3 NA) fluor objective. A Sutter Instruments filter changer enabled alternative excitation at 340 and 380 nm, whereas the emission fluorescence was monitored at 510 nm with a Paultek Imaging camera (model PC-20) equipped with a GenII-Sys intensifier (Dage-MTI, Inc.). The images of multiple cells collected at each excitation wavelength were processed using the MetaFluor software (Universal Imaging Corp., West Chester, PA) to provide ratios of Fura-2 fluorescence from excitation at 340 nm to that from excitation at 380 nm (F 340/F 380). Confocal Microscopy—The fluorescence images were acquired with a Zeiss LSM510 confocal laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY) with an argon laser and excitation at 488 nm through a 100× (oil immersion) objective lens (optical slice thickness, 0.5 μm). The level of expression of TRPC3-Topaz and thus the brightness of the images in DT40 cells were considerably less than in HEK293 cells. Therefore, all of the images have been subjected to a software-driven equalization procedure, scaling gray scale pixel values between the same minimum (black) and maximum (white) values. This allows for maximal contrast and maximal spatial information, which is required in the current study, but precludes quantitative comparisons between different images. The initial goal of the present studies was to define domains of TRPC3 that are required for channel activation by truncating the cytosolic N and C termini of TRPC3. We generated a series of deletion mutants (mutants NΔ1–3 and CΔ4–8; Fig. 1), all of which retained the six predicted transmembrane domains (TM1–TM6) and a putative pore region between TM5 and TM6. In NΔ1 four predicted ankyrin repeats were deleted (amino acids 1–199), whereas in NΔ2 an adjacent predicted coiled coil region was additionally deleted (amino acids 1–330). Mutant NΔ3 lacked virtually all of the cytosolic N terminus (amino acids 1–367). The cytoplasmic C terminus includes the Trp signature motif (EWKFAR), a highly conserved proline-rich motif (TLPXPF) and a region that was shown in pull-down assays to be CIRB. This CIRB site is followed by a second predicted coiled coil region. For C-terminal truncations amino acids 690, 730, 759, 775, or 790–844 were deleted, resulting in a TRPC3 lacking one or more of these domains (CΔ4–8; Fig. 1). All of the mutants were stably expressed in HEK293 cells and tested in FLIPR (see “Materials and Methods”) for agonist-dependent Ca2+ entry in the presence of 1 μm Gd3+, which blocks the endogenous, store-operated channels (15Broad L.M. Cannon T.R. Taylor C.W. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 517: 121-134Crossref Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 16Trebak M. Bird G.St.J. McKay R.R. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21617-21623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In contrast to control cells expressing only the fluorescent marker pdsRedmito, wild type TRPC3-expressing cells showed significant Gd3+-insensitive Ca2+ entry (Fig. 2). All N-terminal mutants (NΔ1–3) lacked Ca2+ entry in response to 100 μm methacholine, suggesting a crucial role for ankyrin repeats in the proper folding, targeting, or anchoring of TRPC3 (Fig. 2). Of the C-terminal truncation mutants CΔ8, which includes the CIRB site, retained agonist dependent Ca2+ entry, whereas CΔ7, which excludes this region, was inactive (Fig. 3).Fig. 2Agonist-induced Ca2+ entry in TRPC3 N-terminal truncation mutants. HEK cells stably expressing pDsRedmito (control), TRPC3, or N-terminal truncation mutants NΔ1, NΔ2, or NΔ3 were seeded in 96-well plates and loaded with Fluo4-AM to measure [Ca2+]i signals. Ca2+ release in response to 100 μm methacholine in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ and Ca2+ entry upon restoration of 1.8 mm extracellular Ca2+ was assessed in the presence of 1 μm Gd3+, which blocks endogenous channels. The change in fluorescence (cps, counts/s) is plotted as a function of time. Shown is a representative experiment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 3Agonist-induced Ca2+ entry in TRPC3 C-terminal truncation mutants.

The light emitted by the fluorescent dye (cps) is recorded as a measure for [Ca2+]i. Ca2+ release in response to 100 μm methacholine in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ and Ca2+ entry upon restoration of 1.8 mm extracellular Ca2+ were assessed in the presence of 1 μm Gd3+, which blocks endogenous channels. Shown is a representative experiment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To examine expression and targeting of the truncated proteins, we constructed a subset of mutants in a TRPC3-Topaz fusion construct (T3T-NΔ1, T3T-CΔ7, and T3T-CΔ8; Fig. 4, top panel). We also constructed two additional deletion mutants. A N-terminal splice variant of TRPC6 had previously been shown to selectively lose OAG but not agonist-stimulated Ca2+ entry (Ref. 17Zhang L. Saffen D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13331-13339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar and see “Discussion”). Thus, we constructed a N-terminal deletion of the first 27 amino acids upstream of the first ankyrin repeat (T3T-NΔ0). We also constructed a C-terminal deletion lacking most of the CIRB region but retaining the downstream coiled coil sequence (amino acids 775–789, T3TCΔ78); a similar TRPC3 construct lacking the CIRB region had previously been demonstrated to have increased current activity following exposure to a TRPC3-interacting IP3 receptor peptide (7Zhang Z. Tang J. Tikunova S. Johnson J.D. Chen Z. Qin N. Dietrich A. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Zhu M.X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3168-3173Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). We selected pools of cells stably expressing T3T or T3T mutants with G418 and enriched for cells with high expression levels using flow cytometry of G418-resistant cell populations (18McKay R.R. Szmeczek-Seay C.L. Lièvremont J.-P. Bird G.St.J. Zitt C. Jüngling E. Lückhoff A. Putney Jr., J.W. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 735-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The cells were tested for Gd3+-insensitive Ca2+ entry in response to agonist stimulation and Ca2+ entry in response to OAG using a FLIPR. As shown in Fig. 5, Ca2+ entry of the truncated Topaz fusion constructs corresponded to Ca2+ entry seen with their corresponding untagged counterparts. T3T-expressing control cells exhibited Gd3+-insensitive Ca2+ entry in response to methacholine activation, as did T3T-CΔ8, whereas deletion constructs missing the N-terminal ankyrin repeats (T3T-NΔ1) or the coiled coil and CIRB region (T3TCΔ7) showed no Ca2+ entry. The conservative N-terminal deletion mutant, T3T-NΔ0, showed normal or partially reduced entry, whereas the CIRB deletion, T3T-CΔ78, was inactive. The latter deletion is similar in length to the active T3T-CΔ8, indicating that it is the specific sequence of amino acids in the CΔ78 (CIRB) region that is important for activity. All of the mutants that showed Gd3+-insensitive Ca2+ entry in response to methacholine could also be activated by OAG (Fig. 6).Fig. 5Agonist-induced Ca2+ entry in Topaz-tagged TRPC3 truncation mutants. HEK cells stably expressing pcDNA3, T3T, or T3T truncation mutants were assayed in a FLIPR as described under “Materials and Methods” to determine Ca2+ release and entry in response to treatment with 100 μm methacholine. The protocol is as described in the legend to Fig. 3. The measurements were performed in the presence of 1 μm Gd3+ to block endogenous channels.

Shown is a representative experiment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether mutants that showed no Ca2+ entry were properly targeted to the plasma membrane, we examined the cellular localization of the respective Topaz fusion proteins by confocal microscopy (Fig. 7). As previously reported for a GFP fusion of TRPC3 (18McKay R.R. Szmeczek-Seay C.L. Lièvremont J.-P. Bird G.St.J. Zitt C. Jüngling E. Lückhoff A. Putney Jr., J.W. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 735-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), wild type T3T was mostly localized in punctate regions in the plasma membrane. There was additional staining in intracellular compartments, possibly in the region of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus, which may represent newly synthesized protein (Fig. 7). A similar pattern was observed for the conservative and physiologically active deletion mutants, T3T-NΔ0 and T3T-CΔ8, although the labeling appears more uniform and less punctate. The physiologically inactive N-terminal truncation mutant T3T-NΔ1 and C-terminal truncation mutants T3T-CΔ7 and T3T-CΔ78 appeared to be predominantly located in intracellular compartments with no detectable labeling of the plasma membrane (Fig. 7). Because the CIRB region appeared to be crucial for plasma membrane targeting of T3T, we also mutated conserved amino acids within the overlapping IP3 receptor/CaM-binding domain to see whether mutations within this region (T3T-YQ/AA and T3T-MKR/AAA; Fig. 4, bottom panel) could also cause loss of plasma membrane targeting as well as agonist and OAG-induced Ca2+ entry seen with deletion of the entire region (Fig. 4, bottom panel). Mutation to alanine of the corresponding residues in L-type Ca2+ channels was shown to reduce both CaM binding and Ca2+-dependent inactivation (19Zuhlke R.D. Pitt G.S. Tsien R.W. Reuter H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21121-21129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). All of the T3T mutants were expressed in HEK293 cells, and G418-resistant cells with high expression levels were selected using flow cytometry. However, these mutations within the CIRB region (T3T-YQ/AA and T3T-MKR/AAA) did not reduce Gd3+-insensitive Ca2+ entry in response to methacholine or OAG as compared with wild type T3T (Fig. 8, A and B). Consistent with this phenotype T3T-YQ/AA was detectable throughout the plasma membrane with some protein in cytosolic compartments, possibly ER/Golgi (Fig. 8C). The findings to this point demonstrate that deletions of the CIRB region block function of TRPC3 by preventing proper trafficking of the protein to the plasma membrane. Because this region has been shown to interact with IP3 receptors (20Boulay G. Brown D.M. Qin N. Jiang M. Dietrich A. Zhu M.X. Chen Z. Birnbaumer M. Mikoshiba K. Birnbaumer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14955-14960Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar), we considered the possibility that this interaction with IP3 receptors is involved in proper targeting of TRPC3. To examine the possible role of IP3 receptors in targeting of TRPC3, we made use of a DT40 chicken B-lymphocyte cell line lacking all three types of IP3 receptors (DT40-KO). To be able to compare phenotypes of T3T and deletion mutants between HEK cells and DT40-KO cells, we first set out to optimize transfection levels of T3T in wild type DT40 cells, which are by experience harder to transfect than HEK cells, aiming to reach similar expression levels as in HEK cells. We accomplished this by two different strategies: first by increasing the amount of plasmid used for transfection from 10 to 100 μg/ml cells as described recently by Vazquez et al. (21Vazquez G. Wedel B.J. Trebak M. Bird St., G.J. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. April 9, 2003; (10.1074/jbc.M302162200)Google Scholar) and second by lowering the incubation temperature after transfection to 30 °C. For DT40 cells grown at 37 °C, no TRPC3-Topaz fluorescence was detectable when applying the settings used for HEK cells in Figs. 7 and 8C (optical slice thickness, 0.5 μm); rather, fluorescent images could be obtained only when the optical slice thickness was maximized, such that the resulting images were not confocal (data not shown). Confocal images of T3T expressing DT40 cells grown at 30 °C, however, could be obtained using the same settings used for HEK cells (Fig. 9A) and show a punctate pattern in the plasma membrane as seen before in HEK cells. Previous functional studies on TRPC3 expressing cells have suggested that IP3 receptors are not required for agonist induced Ca2+ entry in this cell line (21Vazquez G. Wedel B.J. Trebak M. Bird St., G.J. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. April 9, 2003; (10.1074/jbc.M302162200)Google Scholar, 22Venkatachalam K. Ma H.-T. Ford D.L. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33980-33985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Consistent with the functional data, IP3 receptors also do not appear to be required for plasma membrane targeting of T3T because we observe plasma membrane expression of the Topaz-labeled protein in both wild type and DT40-KO cells (Fig. 9A). As for HEK293 cells, deletion of the CIRB region (CΔ7) resulted in the loss of the distinct punctate pattern of plasma membrane localization (Fig. 9A). For functional studies DT40-KO cells were transfected with cDNAs encoding the M5 muscarinic receptor under the control of the chicken β-actin promoter, EYFP as a transfection marker, and the respective T3T construct (Fig. 9B). DT4-KO cells are known to respond to phospholipase C-coupled receptors with generation of IP3, but they do not generate phospholipase C-linked cytosolic Ca2+ signals (13Sugawara H. Kurosaki M. Takata M. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3078-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). The addition of carbachol to DT40-KO cells expressing T3T and M5 receptors presumably causes formation of IP3 and DAG but no release of Ca2+ from stores because of the lack all three types of IP3 receptors. Despite this lack of IP3 receptors, T3T is able to function in a receptor-operated mode as revealed by significant entry of Ba2+ (Fig. 9B). When T3T-CΔ7 and T3T-CΔ8 were expressed in DT40-KO cells, we obtained the same phenotypes as in HEK293 cells; whereas the predicted C-terminal coiled coil region could be deleted in T3T without loss of agonist induced entry, additional deletion of the CIRB region results in loss of function, a function that is independent of the presence of IP3 receptors. Because the CIRB region of TRPC3 has been shown to bind to both the IP3 receptor and CaM, we next set out to test the role of CaM in targeting of TRPC3. We therefore overexpressed T3T in DT40-KO cells together with wild type CaM or a dominant negative CaM mutant (CaMEF1–4mut), in which all four EF hand motifs are mutated (7Zhang Z. Tang J. Tikunova S. Johnson J.D. Chen Z. Qin N. Dietrich A. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Zhu M.X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3168-3173Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). We observed no difference in plasma membrane targeting of T3T in CaM versus CaMEF1–4mut expressing cells (not shown). Thus, in aggregate, our data demonstrate that CIRB (or elements contained therein) is necessary for pr"

Modulation of syntaxin binding properties by protein kinases could be critical to control of neurotransmitter release. Using yeast two-hybrid selection with syntaxin-1A as bait, we have isolated a cDNA encoding the C-terminal domain of death-associated protein (DAP) kinase, a calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine protein kinase. Expression of DAP kinase in adult rat brain is restricted to particular neuronal subpopulations, including the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. Biochemical studies demonstrate that DAP kinase binds to and phosphorylates syntaxin-1 at serine 188. This phosphorylation event occurs both in vitro and in vivo in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Syntaxin-1A phosphorylation by DAP kinase or its S188D mutant, which mimics a state of complete phosphorylation, significantly decreases syntaxin binding to Munc18-1, a syntaxin-binding protein that regulates SNARE complex formation and is required for synaptic vesicle docking. Our results suggest that syntaxin is a DAP kinase substrate and provide a novel signal transduction pathway by which syntaxin function could be regulated in response to intracellular [Ca2+] and synaptic activity.

Neurotransmitter release from presynaptic nerve terminals requires calcium-triggered exocytosis of synaptic vesicles, a process that involves a series of protein-mediated docking and fusion events between the membranes of synaptic vesicles and the presynaptic terminal (1Jahn R.

In neurons, the final stages of vesicle priming and membrane fusion are strictly Ca2+-dependent (12Martin T.F.J. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 271-276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Presynaptic exocytosis is characterized by a fast response with a very short delay between excitation and secretion (13Zucker R.S. Neuron. 1996; 17: 1049-1055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) and by limited release with only a small percentage of morphologically docked vesicles completing fusion upon Ca2+ influx (14Allen C. Stevens C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10380-10383Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). These properties suggest that the molecular basis of SNARE protein-protein interactions that mediate the final steps of synaptic vesicle docking/fusion are tightly and finely regulated.Second messenger regulation of protein interactions within the exocytotic apparatus, for example, by protein phosphorylation or dephosphorylation, may be one mechanism by which cellular events could affect SNARE protein function and mediate synaptic plasticity (8Südhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1759) Google Scholar). Although the time course between action potential arrival at the nerve terminal and the resultant vesicle fusion is too short for protein phosphorylation to exact a direct and acute effect during a single round of vesicle exocytosis, protein kinases, and phosphatases may have significant effects on subsequent neurotransmitter release events in an activity or Ca2+-dependent manner. Activation of protein kinases in presynaptic terminals, particularly CaMKII, PKA, and PKC, has been shown to correlate with transmitter release (15Malenka R.C. Madison D.V. Nicoll R.A.

Trends Neurosci. 1999; 22: 459-464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). For example, in vivo phosphorylation of synapsin, which is dependent on intracellular [Ca2+], has been shown to affect synaptic vesicle availability at release sites and control the kinetics of vesicle pool turnover (44Greengard P. Valtorta F. Czernik A.J. Benfenati F. Science. 1993; 259: 780-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar, 45Hosaka M. Hammer R.E. Südhof T.C.

It is reasonable to speculate that the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation state of synaptic proteins that mediate vesicle exocytosis is critical to the regulation of the biochemical pathways leading from vesicle docking to neurotransmitter release. Thus, identifying protein kinases and phosphatases that modulate the assembly/disassembly of the fusion machinery, particularly kinases and phosphatases functionally regulated by synaptic activity or intracellular [Ca2+], could offer valuable insights to the molecular mechanisms underlying synaptic transmission and plasticity.In the current study, we have used the C-terminal half of syntaxin-1A as a bait to screen a human brain cDNA library via the yeast two-hybrid selection technique. We have isolated one cDNA encoding the C-terminal domain of DAP kinase (47Deiss L.P. Feinsein E. Berissi H. Cohen O. Kimchi A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar), a calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine protein kinase (48Cohen O. Feinsein E. Kimchi A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 998-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). DAP kinase was first reported as a potential mediator of γ-interferon-induced cell death (47Deiss L.P. Feinsein E. Berissi H. Cohen O. Kimchi A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). However, the native substrates of DAP kinase and the molecular pathways underlying DAP kinase-mediated signal transduction remain unclear. Examination of the tissue distribution of DAP kinase mRNA demonstrated that it is predominantly expressed in brain and lung. DAP kinase mRNA is widely distributed in the embryonic brain and gradually declines in postnatum expression. Interestingly, the adult expression of DAP kinase is restricted to particular neuronal subpopulations that are important in memory and learning, such as the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, suggesting that DAP kinase-mediated signal transduction pathway may be implicated in neuronal functions related to synaptic transmission or plasticity (49Sakagami H. Kondo H. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 52: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 50Yamamoto M. Takahashi H. Nakamura T. Hioki T. Nagayama S. Ooashi N. Sun X. Ishii T. Kudo Y. Nakajima-Iijima S. Kimchi A. Uchino S. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 58: 674-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Our current yeast two-hybrid cloning results and biochemical studies demonstrate that DAP kinase binds to and phosphorylates neuronal syntaxin-1A. This phosphorylation event occurs both in vitro and in vivo in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Phosphorylation of syntaxin-1A at Ser-188, or its mutation to S188D, which mimics a state of complete phosphorylation, significantly decreases syntaxin binding to Munc 18-1, a syntaxin regulatory protein that controls SNARE complex formation and vesicle docking (51Dulubova I.

Our results suggest that syntaxin is a Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation target of DAP kinase and that syntaxin phosphorylation at Ser-188 could be a mechanism for regulation of syntaxin binding properties in response to elevated intracellular [Ca2+] and synaptic activity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESIsolation of DAP Kinase—The yeast two-hybrid system was used to isolate proteins that interact with syntaxin-1A. The C-terminal half (CT, 181–288) of rat syntaxin-1A cDNA was inserted in-frame into a pGBT9 bait vector containing the GAL4 DNA binding domain (Clontech). Yeast two-hybrid screens of a human brain cDNA library in vector pACT1 (Clontech) containing the GAL4 activation domain were performed and evaluated according to the protocols described for the MATCH-MAKER yeast two-hybrid system (Clontech). Positive clones were selected on plates lacking leucine, tryptophan, and histidine with 50 mm 3-aminotriazole and confirmed by filter assay for β-galactosidase activity.Fusion Protein Construction, Preparation, and Purification—HA-DAP kinase cDNA was kindly provided by A. Kimchi (47Deiss L.P. Feinsein E. Berissi H. Cohen O. Kimchi A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar), and purified DAP kinase catalytic domain (KD, amino acids 1–285) by Dr. Martin Watterson (54Velentza A.V. Schumacher A.M. Weiss C. Egli M. Watterson D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38956-38965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). DAP kinase (KD-CaM) was produced by subcloning the region of the DAP kinase cDNA that encodes amino acids 1–320, corresponding to the catalytic domain and calmodulin binding regulatory domain, into the pASK-IBA3 (Sigma) expression vector at the BsaI sites. DAP kinase K42A and syntaxin S188A/S188D mutants were generated using the QuikChange™ XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Full-length syntaxin-1A (FL), syntaxin-1AΔTM(1–264, lacking the transmembrane domain), syntaxin-1A N-terminal-half (NT) (2–190), syntaxin-1A C-terminal-half (CT) (181–264), SNAP-25, VAMP-2, Munc18-1, and DAP kinase C-terminal (CT)(1157–1431) were subcloned into GST fusion protein vector pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences) or His6-tagged fusion protein vector (pET28, Novagen). Fusion proteins were prepared as crude bacterial lysates by mild sonication in phosphate-buffered saline (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, plus protease inhibitors of 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin) with 1% Triton X-100. His-tagged fusion proteins were purified by binding to Ni2+-charged nitrilotriacetic acid agarose columns (Qiagen) and eluted with 500 mm imidazole in phosphate-buffered saline. GST fusion proteins were purified by binding to glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) in TBS buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, plus protease inhibitors), and eluted by 15 mm reduced glutathione (in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) or cleaved from the GST tag by incubation with biotinylated thrombin (Novagen) at a final concentration of 0.1 units/μl at room temperature for 4 h. Biotinylated thrombin was removed from the resulting cleavage reactions using streptavidin-agarose beads (Novagen). The eluates were dialyzed in a 10,000-molecular weight cutoff dialysis cassette (Pierce) against TBS and concentrated using Centriprep-10 filtration units (Amicon).In Vitro Binding—Approximately 1 μg of GST fusion proteins were bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) in TBS buffer, incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with constant agitation, and washed with TBS to remove unbound proteins. Glutathione-Sepharose beads coupled with similar amounts of GST fusion proteins were added to the full-length HA-tagged DAP kinase lysates from transfected HEK293T cells or His-DAP-kinase-CT lysates from bacteria and incubated with gentle mixing for 3 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with TBS buffer, and bound proteins were eluted in 30 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and electrophoresed on 10–20% SDS-Tricine gradient gel. Bound HA-DAP-kinase or His-DAP-kinase-CT was detected by anti-DAP kinase antibody (Sigma) or monoclonal anti-HisT7-tag antibody (Novagen), respectively, and GST fusion proteins were detected by anti-GST antibody (Amersham Biosciences). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and ECL (Amersham Biosciences) were used to visualize the bands.Transfection of HEK293T Cells—HEK293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 0.5% l-glutamine. Syntaxin-1A cDNA was inserted into the HindIII site of the pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen). HEK293T cells cultured in 100-mm dishes were transfected with 5–10 μg of cDNA using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen), according to the instruction manual. After 48 h, the cells were harvested and solubilized in TBS buffer with 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was used for in vitro binding and immunoprecipitation studies.Synaptosome Preparation—Rat brain synaptosomes were prepared by differential and discontinuous Percoll gradient centrifugation and solubilized as described (55Sheng Z.-H. Rettig J. Cook T. Catterall W.A. Nature. 1996; 379: 451-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Synaptosome fractions were isolated as described (56Dunkley P.R. Heath J.W. Harrison S.M. Jarvie P.E. Glenfield P.J. Rostas J.A.P. Brain Res. 1998; 441: 59-71Crossref Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Briefly, after Percoll-sucrose gradient centrifugation, the synaptosomes were washed once in medium M (0.32 m sucrose, 1 mm K2HPO4, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5), resuspended and homogenized in medium L (1 mm K2HPO4, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0), and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. The resulting suspension was layered over 5 ml of 1 m sucrose in medium L and centrifuged for 30 min at 96,300 × g in an SW27 rotor. The supernatant was mixed to homogeneity and centrifuged again for 14 h at 25,000 × g. The supernatant was collected as synaptosol, and the pellets were homogenized in medium L and applied to a gradient of 7 ml of 1.2, 1.0, 0.8, 0.6, and 0.4 m sucrose in medium L and centrifuged for 90 min at 68,000 × g in an SW27 rotor. Bands at each interface were collected and washed once with medium L in a Ti50 rotor (45 min at 106,500 × g). The synaptosol was dialyzed against medium L and centrifuged at 140,000 × g in a Ti50 rotor for 1 h to separate any remaining synaptic vesicles from soluble proteins. All pellets were then resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). The concentrations of total proteins in each fraction were determined by BCA protein assay (Pierce) against a bovine serum albumin standard.Immunocytochemistry of Cultured Hippocampal Cells—Rat hippocampal neuron cultures were prepared at a density of 100,000 cells/ml on polyornithine-and fibronectin-coated glass chamber slides (Lab-Tek) from hippocampi dissected from E18 rat embryos as described (57Higgins D. Banker G. Banker G. Goslin K. Primary Dissociated Cell Cultures. In Culturing Nerve Cells. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1998: 37-78Google Scholar). Cultures were plated on a glial bed in Neurobasal (Invitrogen) supplemented with 1× B27 and 100× l-glutamine, with half-feed changes every 3–4 days. Neurons were prepared for immunofluorescent confocal microscopy on DIV11 following fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde, solubilization in 0.1% Triton X-100, and blocking in 1% bovine serum albumin. Antibodies against syntaxin-1 (from M. Takahashi) and DAP kinase (from R.-H. Chen, Ref. 58Jang C-W. Chen C.-H. Chen C.-C. Chen J.-Y. Su Y.-H. Chen R.-H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) were detected using tagged fluorescent anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies (Jackson).Coimmunoprecipitation—Solubilized proteins (100–300 μg) from transfected HEK293T cell lysates or brain homogenates were incubated with either 3 μg of anti-syntaxin-1 (10H5) monoclonal antibody or 3 μg of non-immune mouse IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) as control in 0.5 ml of TBS with 0.1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors, and incubated on a microtube rotator at 4 °C for 3 h. Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B resin (2.5 mg) (Amersham Biosciences) was added to each sample, and the incubation continued for an additional 1 h, followed by three washes with TBS/0.1% Triton X-100. Subsequent interaction assays of immunoprecipitated and immobilized protein complexes are described in the section on in vitro binding assays above. For multiple detection with different antibodies, blots were first stripped between applications of each antibody in a solution of 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 20 mm dithiothreitol, and 1% SDS for 20 min at 50 °C with agitation and then washed with TBS/0.1% Tween-20 for 30 min.Phosphorylation Reactions—Lysates of transfected HEK293T cells with pcDNA-HA-DAP-kinase were immunoprecipitated with 1 μg of anti-HA polyclonal antibodies (Clontech) in 0.5 ml of TBS/0.1% Triton X-100 with protease inhibitors. After 3 h of incubation at 4 °C, protein A-Sepharose CL-4B resin (2.5 mg) was added and incubated for 1 h. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with TBS/0.1% Triton X-100 and once with the kinase assay buffer (50 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 8 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). Isolated and immobilized DAP kinase full-length or purified DAP kinase catalytic domain (KD) or KD-CaM domain were then incubated for 30 min at 30 °Cin25–50 μlof reaction buffer containing 5–15 μCi [γ-32P]ATP (1.6–5 pmol) (Amersham Biosciences), 100 μm ATP, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 50 pmol of purified syntaxin-1A. The reactions were terminated by adding SDS-PAGE sample buffer and then heated at 95 °C for 5 min. Aliquots of phosphorylated products were analyzed by 10–20% Tricine SDS-PAGE, stained with Coomassie Blue, and then dried and exposed to x-ray film for autoradiography. For the Ca2+-buffering system, 10 mm EGTA or 10 mm nitrolotriacetic acid was used to produce free Ca2+ buffer (59Augustine G.J. Neher E. J. Physiol. 1992; 450: 247-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar) as calculated using the max chelator software (version 6.63). For back-phosphorylation studies, HEK293T cells co-transfected with syntaxin-1A and HA-DAP-kinase wild type or K42A mutant were stimulated with 10 μm ionomycin at room temperature for 30 min and then solubilized with 1% Triton X-100. Lysates (2 mg of total protein) were incubated with an anti-stx1 antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were then back-phosphorylated in vitro with anti-HA-immobilized full-length DAP kinase isolated from transfected HEK293 cell lysates. Back-phosphorylation was performed in small volumes (100 μl) with constant agitation throughout the incubation time.RESULTSIsolation of DAP Kinase and Its Association with Syntaxin-1A—To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying neurotransmitter release and its modulation, we have used the C-terminal-half (181–288) of syntaxin-1A as a bait to screen a human brain cDNA library via the yeast two-hybrid selection technique. Screening of ∼2 × 106 colonies led to the isolation of six classes of cDNAs encoding α-SNAP (10 clones), β-SNAP (13 clones), SNAP-25 (3 clones), syntaphilin (2 clones), syntaxin-1A (5 clones), SNAP-29 (2 clones), and one cDNA encoding the C-terminal domain (1386–1431) of DAP kinase (Fig. 1A) (47Deiss L.P. Feinsein E. Berissi H. Cohen O. Kimchi A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Because the yeast two-hybrid system may identify low affinity interactions that may not normally occur either in vitro or in vivo, we conducted four lines of experiments to confirm the selective and direct interaction between DAP kinase and syntaxin-1A. First, we performed in vitro binding assays with recombinant proteins. While HA-tagged full-length DAP kinase selectively bound to GST-syntaxin-1A in a Ca2+/calmodulin-independent manner, no binding was detectable to GST-VAMP2 or GST alone (Fig. 1B). Next, while DAP-kinase-CT (1157–1431, Fig. 1A) bound to both GST-syntaxin-1A full-length and GST-syntaxin-1A-CT-(181–288), no binding was found to GST-syntaxin-1A-NT-(2–190), GST-VAMP2 or GST alone (Fig. 1C), consistent with a specific association of DAP kinase with syntaxin-1A via a direct interaction of their C-terminal domains. Furthermore, we sought to confirm the DAP kinase-syntaxin-1A interaction in a mammalian expression system. A cDNA encoding His-tagged full-length DAP kinase was co-transfected into HEK293T cells with the cDNA encoding syntaxin-1A. The association of endogenous DAP kinase with syntaxin-1A was then confirmed by immunoprecipitation with anti-syntaxin-1 antibody (Fig. 1, D and E). DAP kinase was coimmunoprecipitated with syntaxin-1A from rat brain homogenate by anti-syntaxin-1 antibody but not by non-immune mouse IgG (Fig. 1F). Finally, we performed a Coomassie-based estimation of the stoichiometry of the syntaxin-DAPK-CT interaction using purified recombinant proteins. Our studies show that, under our experimental conditions, the interaction of His-tagged syntaxin-1A with GST-DAPK-CT occurs at relative concentrations approaching a 1:1 molar ratio, as determined by semi-quantification using purified recombinant proteins as standards (Fig. 1G). The results from our yeast two-hybrid selection, in vitro binding assays, and immunoprecipitation studies indicate that DAP kinase directly interacts with syntaxin-1A.Distribution and Subcellular Localization of DAP Kinase— DAP kinase mRNA has been found to be present in brain tissue, and particularly in the hippocampus of adult rats (49Sakagami H. Kondo H. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 52: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 50Yamamoto M. Takahashi H. Nakamura T. Hioki T. Nagayama S. Ooashi N. Sun X. Ishii T. Kudo Y. Nakajima-Iijima S. Kimchi A. Uchino S. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 58: 674-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To determine the expression of DAP kinase protein in brain, we performed immunoblot using a monoclonal anti-DAP kinase antibody on various homogenates of anatomically and functionally distinct areas of adult rat brain including cortex, hippocampus, olfactory bulb, mesencephalon, midbrain, cerebellum, and spinal cord. Only cortex, hippocampus, and olfactory bulb showed prominent expression of DAP kinase in the adult rat brain (Fig. 2A). To examine the subcellular distribution of DAP kinase in neurons, we prepared a subcellular fractionation assay from crude synaptosomal preparations. By sucrose density gradient centrifugation, rat cerebral"

Osteopontin (OPN)/αvβ3 generated Rho signaling pathway is required for the surface expression of CD44. In this work we show the Rho effector, Rho kinase (ROK-α), to be a potent activator of CD44 surface expression. ROK-α activation was associated with autophosphorylation, leading to its translocation to the plasma membrane, as well as its association with CD44. ROK-α promoted CD44 surface expression through phosphorylation of CD44 and ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM) proteins and CD44·ERM·actin complex formation. Osteoclasts from OPN–/– mice exhibited an ∼55–60% decrease in basal level ROK-α phosphorylation as compared with wild type osteoclasts. Furthermore, RhoVal-14 transduction was only partially effective in stimulating ROK-α/CD44 phosphorylation, as well as CD44 surface expression, in these osteoclasts. Studies on the inhibition of Rho by C3 transferase or ROK-α by the specific inhibitor, Y-27632, showed a decrease in the phosphorylation mediated by ROK-α and CD44 surface expression. Neutralizing antibodies to αv, β3, or CD44 inhibited the migration and bone resorption of wild type osteoclasts. However, only anti-αv or -β3 antibodies blocked OPN-induced phosphorylation of ROK-α, CD44, and the ERM proteins. Our results strongly suggest a role for ROK-α in αvβ3-mediated Rho signaling, which is required for the phosphorylation events and CD44 surface expression. The functional deficiencies in the Rho effector(s) because of the lack of OPN were associated with decreased CD44 surface expression and hypomotility in the OPN–/– osteoclasts. Finally, we find that cooperativity exists between αvβ3 and CD44 for osteoclast motility and bone resorption. Osteoclasts from osteopontin-efficient mice exhibit decreased CD44 surface expression.

Chemistry and Biology of Mineralized Tissues. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1992Google Scholar). Although osteopontin serves many functions in bone cells besides regulating mineralization of the matrix, regulation of osteoclast motility and resorption is perhaps its most important. Osteopontin is a ligand for several cell surface adhesion receptors, such as αvβ3, αvβ1, αvβ5, α4β1, α8β1, and α9β1 (reviewed in Refs. 4Denhardt D.T. Noda M. J. Cell.

The hyaluronic acid receptor, CD44, is also a receptor for OPN (6Weber G.F. Ashkar S. Glimcher M.J. Cantor H. Science. 1996; 271: 509-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). CD44 has been implicated in chemotaxis mediated by OPN (6Weber G.F. Ashkar S. Glimcher M.J. Cantor H. Science. 1996; 271: 509-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar, 7Isacke C.M. Yarwood H. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 34: 718-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), as well as in bone resorption (8Udagawa N. Findlay D.M. Martin T.J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11: S112Google Scholar). CD44 expression was reported in osteoclasts of human and rat bone sections (9Hughes D.E. Salter D.M. Dedhar S. Simpson R. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1993; 8: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 10Nakamura H. Ozawa H. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11: 1715-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 11Jamal H.H. Aubin J.E. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 223: 467-477Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Weber et al. (6Weber G.F. Ashkar S. Glimcher M.J. Cantor H. Science. 1996; 271: 509-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar), have shown that the binding of soluble OPN to fibroblasts transfected with CD44 cDNA is blocked by anti-CD44 antibody. Moreover, anti-CD44 or anti-OPN antibodies inhibited the migration of CD44-transfected fibroblasts toward OPN in Boyden chambers (7Isacke C.M. Yarwood H. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 34: 718-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), suggesting CD44-OPN interaction and a role in chemotactic function. Expression of OPN and CD44 was increased in migrating fetal fibroblasts (12Zohar R. Lee W. Arora P. Cheifetz S. McCulloch C. Sodek J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 170: 88-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and the colocalization of CD44 and OPN was prominent at the leading edge of migrating osteoclasts. Osteoclasts are multinucleated highly differentiated motile cells responsible for bone resorption. As osteoclasts crawl over bone surfaces, they require rapid attachment and release from the extracellular matrix. Adhesion structures called podosomes present in highly motile cells are also found in osteoclasts. Osteoclasts are unique, because they use the speed of podosome assembly and disassembly to generate high rates of motility (13Baron R. Rev. Rhum. Engl. Ed. 1996; 63: 633-638PubMed Google Scholar, 14Kanehisa J. Heersche J.N.M. Bone. 1988; 9: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Bone resorption involves active motility of osteoclasts on bone surfaces to be resorbed. Osteoclasts undergo alternative cycles of motility and bone resorption. The attachment of osteoclasts to the bone surface involves interaction of osteoclast integrins with extracellular matrix proteins within the bone matrix. OPN was expressed in murine wild type osteoclasts, localized to the basolateral, clear zone, and ruffled border membranes, and deposited in the resorption pits during bone resorption (15Chellaiah M. Kizer N. Biswas R.S. Alvarez U. Strauss-Schoenberger J. Rifas L. Rittling S. Denhardt D. Hruska K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 173-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Addition of OPN to osteoclast cultures mimicking secretion from the basolateral surface stimulated cell shape changes and cytoskeletal rearrangement observed when cell motility is induced (16Chellaiah M. Soga N. Swanson S. McAllister S. Alvarez U. Wang D. Dowdy S.F. Hruska K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11993-12002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 17Chellaiah M. Hruska K. Calcif. Tissue Int. 2003; 72: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). To further characterize the functional deficiency in osteoclasts caused by the death of OPN, we used mice null for OPN. Osteoclasts from OPN–/– mice are hypomotile and partially disabled in bone resorption because of an inability of osteoclasts to form deep resorption pits. Treatment of OPN–/– osteoclasts with exogenous OPN partially rescued the phenotype by stimulating motility and increasing the expression of CD44 on the basolateral plasma membrane surface. Both antibodies to CD44 and β3 blocked the stimulatory actions of OPN on motility and bone resorption. These results demonstrated that the surface expression of CD44 was a key function of OPN and hence results in the hypomotility of OPN-deficient osteoclasts (15Chellaiah M. Kizer N. Biswas R.S. Alvarez U. Strauss-Schoenberger J. Rifas L. Rittling S. Denhardt D. Hruska K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 173-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). We have shown that Rho activation is a critical step in the stimulation of motility by exogenous OPN (16Chellaiah M. Soga N. Swanson S. McAllister S. Alvarez U. Wang D. Dowdy S.F. Hruska K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11993-12002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). OPN/αvβ3 generated outside-in the Rho signaling pathway is required for the surface expression of CD44 and motility of osteoclasts (15Chellaiah M. Kizer N. Biswas R.S. Alvarez U. Strauss-Schoenberger J. Rifas L. Rittling S. Denhardt D. Hruska K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 173-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). One downstream effect of Rho signaling pathway is targeting of the CD44·ERM complex to the osteoclast plasma membrane. OPN-deficient osteoclasts fail to efficiently move CD44 to the surface of the plasma membrane, and exogenous addition of OPN or Rho is sufficient to partially rescue the phenotype. Rescue of the phenotype by exogenous OPN is blocked by antibodies to the β3 integrin (15Chellaiah M. Kizer N. Biswas R.S. Alvarez U. Strauss-Schoenberger J. Rifas L. Rittling S. Denhardt D. Hruska K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 173-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Here, we analyze the mechanism by which OPN-stimulated Rho activation mediates movement of CD44 to the plasma membrane. The Rho downstream effector, Rho kinase, has been implicated in cell migration (18Itoh K. Yoshioka. K. Akedo H. Uehata M. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar, 19Bourguignon L.Y. Zhu H. Shao L. Zhu D. Chen Y.W. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1999; 43: 269-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Both the Rho A GTPase and Rho kinase (ROK-α) are physically associated with CD44 and its associated cytoskeletal proteins (19Bourguignon L.Y. Zhu H. Shao L. Zhu D. Chen Y.W. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1999; 43: 269-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The CD44 cytoplasmic tail interacts with cytoskeletal-related components including actin, ankyrin, and the ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM) family (20Hirao M. Sato N. Kondo T. Yonemura S. Monden M. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 37-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). ROK plays a pivotal role in CD44 phosphorylation and its interaction with ankyrin and the ERM complex (21Matsui T. Maeda M. Doi Y. Yonemura S. Amano M. Kaibuchi K. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 647-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). ERM·actin complexes appear to be essential prerequisites for Rho-induced cytoskeletal changes and cell migration (22Watanabe N. Kato T. Fujita A. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 136-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). The ERM family and Rho are localized at specialized plasma membrane areas, including membrane ruffling area and cell-cell contact sites in Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial cells (23Takaishi K. Sasaki T. Kameyama T. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 39-48PubMed Google Scholar). The translocation of ERM proteins to the plasma membrane is thought to be regulated by Rho signaling (20Hirao M. Sato N. Kondo T. Yonemura S. Monden M. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 37-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 23Takaishi K. Sasaki T. Kameyama T. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. Takai Y.

ERM proteins cross-link actin filaments with plasma membrane. The carboxyl terminus of these proteins is associated with actin, and the amino terminus binds plasma membrane using a binding partner, CD44 (25Tsukita S. Tanpakushitsu Kakusan Koso. 1996; 41: 1899-1905PubMed Google Scholar, 26Yonemura S. Hirao M. Doi Y. Takahashi N. Kondo T. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 885-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). Rho A (complexed with CD44V3, 8–10) regulates the phosphorylation of CD44, as well as the proteins associated with CD44 through ROK activation (19Bourguignon L.Y. Zhu H. Shao L. Zhu D. Chen Y.W. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1999; 43: 269-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Because the transduction of constitutively active RhoVal-14 into osteoclasts increased the cell surface expression of CD44, as well as osteoclast motility (15Chellaiah M. Kizer N. Biswas R.S.

Cell. 2003; 14: 173-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), and Rho effector, ROK, has a predominant role in the phosphorylation of CD44/ERM proteins during actin filament and plasma membrane interaction (28Arpin M. Algrain M. Louvard D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 136-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 29Nakamura F. Amieva M.R. Hirota C. Mizuno Y. Furthmayr H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Cell Tissue Res. 1995; 280: 225-233PubMed Google Scholar), we hypothesized that phosphorylations of CD44 and ERM proteins require the activation of Rho effector(s). We report here that OPN stimulated Rho-dependent activation and phosphorylation of Rho kinase (ROK-α or ROCK II), its association with CD44, and CD44 surface expression in osteoclasts generated from WT mice. In osteoclasts generated from OPN–/– mice, CD44 surface expression was decreased, even though there were no changes in actin levels, podosome organization, or morphology. This was because of diminished levels of ROK-α associated with CD44. RhoVal-14 transduction and OPN treatment increased ROK-α phosphorylation and CD44 surface expression in OPN–/– osteoclasts but not to levels of full stimulation as in wild type osteoclasts. Furthermore, ROK-α activation, dependent on OPN stimulation of αvβ3 signaling, was required for CD44 surface expression. Materials—Monoclonal antibody to ROK-α was obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Goat polyclonal ROK-α (or ROCK II; catalog number sc-1852), ROK-β (or ROCK I; catalog number sc-6055), integrin αv (sc-6616), and β3 (sc-6627) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Anti-CD44 antibody developed by Dr. Jayne Lesley was used (31Lesley J. Trowbridge I.S. Immunogenetics. 1982; 15: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Anti-CD44 antibodies to the standard (monoclonal and polyclonal) were also purchased from BioSource International, Inc. (Camarillo, CA). Rabbit anti-αv (AB1930), -β3 (AB1932), -phosphoserine, and -phosphothreonine antibodies were purchased from Chemicon International, Inc. (Temecula, CA). OPN antibody was developed from the purified His6-tagged OPN protein in Aves Laboratories, Inc. (Tigard, OR). CY2- or CY3-conjugated anti-mouse, rabbit, or goat antibodies were purchased from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Inc. (Westgrove, PA). ROK inhibitor, Y-27632, was purchased from Calbiochem-Novabiochem. The protein assay reagent kit, reagents for polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and molecular weight standards were purchased from Bio-Rad. Protein A-Sepharose, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated mouse, goat, or rabbit IgG, and other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Histone H1 was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY) and Sigma. [γ-32P]ATP and rainbow molecular weight markers for proteins were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Osteopontin-deficient Mice—The OPN-deficient mouse colony originally established at Rutgers University by homologous recombination in ES cells (32Rittling S.R. Matsumoto H.N. McKee M.D. Nanci A. An X.R. Novick K.E. Kowalski A.J. Noda M. Denhardt D.T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 1101-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) was re-derived at Washington University by caesarian section. The analyses described were performed using wild type and null animals on a 129 × C57BL/6 hybrid background. Purification of Osteopontin Protein—Mouse OPN cDNA was cloned into the BamHI/XbaI site of pQE 30 vector (Qiagen, Inc. Valencia, CA). OPN was expressed as a His6-tagged protein. OPN was purified from the bacterial lysate using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography following the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen, Inc. Valencia, CA). Preparation of Mouse Osteoclast Precursors—Mouse osteoclasts were generated in vitro using mouse bone marrow cells as described previously (33Chellaiah M.A. Biswas R.S. Yuen D. Alvarez U.M. Hruska K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47434-47444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Mouse osteoclasts were generated in vitro using the mouse bone marrow cells. Cells isolated from five mice were cultured into 100-mm dishes with 20 ml of α-MEM medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (α-10). After culture for 24 h, non-adhered cells were layered on histopaque-1077 (Sigma) and centrifuged at 300 × g for 15 min at room temperature. The cell layer between the histopaque and the media was removed and washed with α–10 media at 2000 rpm for 7 min at room temperature. Cells were resuspended in α-10 media and cultured with the appropriate concentrations of macrophage colony-stimulating factor-1 (10 ng/ml) and OPGL (55–75 ng/ml). After 3 days in culture, media were replaced with fresh cytokines. The multinucleated osteoclasts were seen from day 4. About 90–95% TRAP-positive osteoclasts were observed from day 5 onwards. To remove the osteoclasts for in vitro bone resorption or motility studies, cells were washed with PBS and kept in a cell stripper solution (Cellgro by Media Tech, Inc., Hemdon, VA) for 15–30 min. Cell stripper is a non-enzymatic cell dissociation solution designed to gently dislodge adherent cells in tissue culture. After incubation with the cell stripper solution, osteoclasts were removed from the plates by gentle scraping. Some of the removed cells were re-plated and stained either with trypan blue or for TRAP. Cells excluded trypan blue, and they were 99% TRAP-positive. These TRAP-positive cells were used for migration and bone resorption assays as described below. Protein Transduction into Mouse Osteoclasts—HA-TAT expression vector containing cDNAs for RhoGTPases (Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 constitutively active or dominant negative form) were cloned into a bacterial expression vector to produce TAT fusion proteins. Herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) protein (42 kDa) was used as a nonspecific protein control. The purification of the protein was done as described previously (16Chellaiah M. Soga N.

After osteoclasts were kept in serum-free α-MEM for 2 h, TAT proteins were added to cells to a final concentration of 100 nm in serum-free media. Dose- and time-dependent uptake of proteins were determined. Maximum uptake was observed between 20 and 45 min. We chose a 30-min time period for the incubation with TAT proteins. GST-C3 exoenzyme (16Chellaiah M. Soga N. Swanson S. McAllister S. Alvarez U. Wang D. Dowdy S.F. Hruska K.A. J. Biol.

J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 647-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar), respectively prior to OPN treatment or RhoVal-14 transduction. Rho transduction was done as described (16Chellaiah M.

Lysate Preparation and Western Analysis—Osteoclasts were kept in serum-free medium for 2 h and treated with OPN to a final concentration of 25 μg per ml for 15 min at 37 °C as described previously (37Chellaiah M. Hruska K.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 743-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Some cultures were treated with one of the following antibodies: anti-αv, anti-β3 (25–30 μg/ml for antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. or 50–65 μg/ml for antibodies from Chemicon), anti-CD44 antibody (20–30 μg/ml for anti-CD44 antibody developed by Dr. Jayne Lesley (31Lesley J. Trowbridge I.S. Immunogenetics. 1982; 15: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) or 50 μg/ml monoclonal CD44 antibody (AR4401) purchased from BioSource International Inc. (Camarillo, CA)); 50 μg/ml OPN antibody developed in the laboratory from the His6-tagged protein was used. Following treatments with OPN or TAT proteins, as described above, osteoclasts were washed three times with ice-cold PBS, and cells were lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 1% deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1% aprotinin, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) (23Takaishi K. Sasaki T. Kameyama T. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 39-48PubMed Google Scholar). Protein contents were measured using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent kit. Equal amounts of lysate proteins were used for immunoprecipitation. Western analysis and kinase assays were performed as described (37Chellaiah M. Hruska K.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 743-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In Vitro ROK Assay—Equal amounts of lysate proteins were subjected to immunoprecipitation with either CD44 or ROK antibodies. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with the lysis buffer (23Takaishi K. Sasaki T. Kameyama T. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 39-48PubMed Google Scholar) and two times with the kinase assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCL, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.06% CHAPS). The kinase assay was performed in 50 μl of kinase assay buffer containing 5 μm ATP, 5–10 ng of histone H1, and [γ-32P]ATP (5 μCi/assay). Assay was carried out with or without exogenous substrate, histone H1. After incubation for 30 min at 30 °C, the reaction mixture was boiled in SDS containing sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE (10%). The radiolabeled bands were visualized by autoradiography (36Coleman M.L. Sahai E.A. Yeo M. Bosch M. Dewar A. Olson M.F. Nat.

Bone Resorption Assay—Whale dentine slices (1.5 cm2 in size and 0.75 mm in thickness) were cut from previously prepared rectangular sticks on a low speed saw and were stored in 70% ethanol until required. Prior to being used in a resorption assay, the slices were sonicated for 3–5 min in distilled water and washed for 2 h in two changes of fresh distilled water. The slices were re-sterilized in fresh 70% ethanol and placed into wells of a 48-well tissue culture plate. Following three washes with α-MEM serum-free medium, the slices were placed overnight in a 37 °C incubator in the same medium. Osteoclasts were gently scraped as described above, and the osteoclast suspension (2 × 104 cells) was added to each well. After 2 h of adherence, the culture medium was replaced with α-MEM containing either mouse OPN (10 μg/ml) or Tat proteins as described above. Some wells were treated with GST-C3 exoenzyme (16Chellaiah M. Soga N. Swanson S. McAllister S. Alvarez U. Wang D. Dowdy S.F. Hruska K.A. J. Biol.

After 24 h, the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing the respective proteins, antibodies, or inhibitors at concentrations as described above. Following incubation for 48 h, cells were scrapped from the slices, and the slices were washed seven to ten times with water. Pits were stained with acid hematoxylin (Sigma) for 6 min, washed well with water, and counted. The pits were imaged under a ×40 objective in a Zeiss inverted phase contrast microscope fitted with a CCD camera. The images were processed by the Adobe Photoshop software program (Adobe Systems, Inc., Mountain View, CA) (16Chellaiah M. Soga N. Swanson S. McAllister S. Alvarez U. Wang D. Dowdy S.F. Hruska K.A.

Then the culture medium was replaced with α-MEM (serum-free) medium containing either mouse OPN (10 μg/ml) or Tat proteins as described above. Osteoclasts were washed with PBS and incubated with a monoclonal antibody to CD44 (1:100 dilution) for 2 h. Cells were then rinsed two to three times with cold PBS, fixed with paraformaldehyde, and treated with ethanol for permeabilization of osteoclasts. After rinsing twice with cold PBS, cells were incubated with an anti-goat ROK-α antibody (1:100) for 2 h. Cells were then rinsed a few times with PBS and counter-stained with CY3-conjugated anti-mouse or CY2-conjugated anti-goat secondary antibodies to anti-mouse CD44 or anti-goat ROK-α antibodies for 2 h. The cells were then rinsed three to four times with PBS and mounted on a slide in a mounting solution (Vector laboratories, Inc., Burlingham, CA) (16Chellaiah M. Soga N. Swanson S. McAllister S.

The cells were viewed on a Bio-Rad (radiance 2100) confocal laser-scanning microscope (Bio-Rad) using a ×60 oil immersion lens. Confocal images were processed by the Adobe Photoshop software program (Adobe Systems, Inc., Mountain View, CA). Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting (FACS) Analysis—After 4 days in culture, osteoclasts were gently scraped as described above, and cells were resuspended in α-10 medium containing appropriate concentrations of macrophage colony-stimulating factor-1 (10 ng/ml) and OPGL (55–75 ng/ml). The osteoclast suspension (2 × 105 to 1 × 106cells) was added to 35-mm tissue culture dishes and incubated at 37 °C overnight. After 24 h, the cells were kept in serum-free medium for 2 h.

https://openalex.org/W2001510832,"Few details are known of the mechanisms through which multiple upstream open reading frames (uORFs) interact to regulate translation in higher eukaryotes. The predominant transcript of oncogene mdm2 in normal human cells (L-mdm2) contains two upstream open reading frames in its 5′ leader. Elimination of these two uORFs raises the translational efficiency of the transcript by over 10-fold in HeLa cells. The 5′-most uORF (uORF1) alone suppresses downstream translational activity by over 5-fold, whereas uORF2 contributes <2-fold to the inhibition by the intact leader. The different activities of the two uORFs do not depend on the nucleotide sequence surrounding the uORFs in the 5′ leader, the order of the two uORFs in the 5′ leader, or the occurrence of secondary structure or rare codons within the uORFs. Specific features of the amino acid sequence encoded by uORF1 contribute to its stronger suppressive activity, suggesting that it belongs to the class of “sequence-specific” uORFs. The weaker inhibitory activity inherent in uORF2 is potentiated by a sub-optimal nucleotide context surrounding its initiator AUG. The occurrence of two uORFs with differing activities in both the human gene and the mouse orthologue suggests that this pair of elements may play a fundamental role in regulating expression of the mdm2 gene.

The occurrence of two uORFs with differing activities in both the human gene and the mouse orthologue suggests that this pair of elements may play a fundamental role in regulating expression of the mdm2 gene. Open reading frames in the 5′ leaders of messenger RNAs, which are termed upstream open reading frames (uORFs), 1The abbreviations used are: uORF, upstream open reading frame; hORF, human ORF; mORF, mouse ORF; hGH, human growth hormone; S-mdm2, short form of mdm2 RNA; L-mdm2, long form of mdm2 RNA; AdoMetDC, S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase; IRES, internal ribosome entry. are emerging as important mediators of transcript-specific translational control (1Geballe A.P. Sachs M.S. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 595-614Google Scholar, 2Morris D.R. Geballe A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8635-8642Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). uORFs can occur singly and multiply, depending on the particular transcript, and there are regulatory implications associated with both of these situations. In order for a single uORF to regulate ribosome access to downstream coding sequences, it seems that two conditions must be met. 1) Translation of the uORF must block reinitiation that could lead to translation further downstream on the mRNA; and 2) there must be a regulated mechanism for attenuating or bypassing the block. “Sequence-dependent uORFs” block movement of ribosomes on the 5′ leader as a result of specific interactions of uORF-encoded nascent peptides with targets that are thought to be components of the translation machinery (2Morris D.R. Geballe A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8635-8642Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Ribosomes have been found arrested on sequence-dependent uORFs either during the elongation phase of translation or at termination, depending on the sequence of the particular peptide and, therefore, the identity of its target. Another situation leading to inhibition is where a uORF is out of frame with and overlapping the initiator AUG of the major open reading frame. One way of regulating both overlapping uORFs (3Harding H.P. Novoa I. Zhang Y.H. Zeng H.Q. Wek R. Schapira M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1099-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2415) Google Scholar) and sequence-specific uORFs is through modulated recognition of the initiation codon of the uORF, which leads to “leaky scanning.” Another mechanism of regulation is mediated through elimination of inhibitory uORFs in alternative forms of transcripts (4Waterhouse P. Khokha R. Denhardt D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5585-5589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Brown C.Y. Mize G.J. Pineda M. George D.L. Morris D.R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5631-5637Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Specific regulation of sequence-dependent uORFs occurs when interaction of the nascent peptide with its target is modulated (2Morris D.R. Geballe A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8635-8642Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). In addition to single uORFs, multiple uORFs are found in mammalian genes, particularly those encoding oncoproteins, growth factors, and growth factor receptors (2Morris D.R. Geballe A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8635-8642Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 6Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4168) Google Scholar, 7Geballe A.P. Morris D.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 159-164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). A fungal model for regulation through multiple uORFs is the yeast GCN4 gene, the translation of which is controlled through interactions of four uORFs (8Hinnebusch A.G. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 199-244Google Scholar). There is no similarly detailed model for regulation through multiple uORFs in higher eukaryotes. One of the human oncogene mdm2 transcripts contains two uORFs, and these two elements cooperate to inhibit translation of the oncoprotein product (5Brown C.Y. Mize G.J. Pineda M. George D.L. Morris D.R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5631-5637Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Inhibition by the two uORFs seems to be of biological significance, because a class of tumors arises from overexpression of a shortened mdm2 mRNA with both uORFs eliminated (5Brown C.Y. Mize G.J. Pineda M. George D.L. Morris D.R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5631-5637Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 9Landers J.E. Cassel S.L. George D.L.

Lefrere I. Ronsin M. Feunteun J. Tursz T. Wiels J. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1603-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). This “short form” of the mdm2 mRNA (S-mdm2) is generally present at low levels in normal cells, and its 5′ leader contains no obvious regulatory elements. mRNAs containing the S-mdm2 leader are very efficiently loaded with ribosomes (5Brown C.Y. Mize G.J. Pineda M. George D.L. Morris D.R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5631-5637Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The “long form” transcript (L-mdm2 mRNA) is constitutively expressed and has a relatively long 5′ leader of 297 nucleotides. mRNAs containing the L-mdm2 5′ leader are >10 times less efficiently translated than S-mdm2 mRNAs in the cell types tested. This inhibitory activity of the L-mdm2 leader is due to the presence of the two uORFs, which seem to cooperate in inhibiting translation (5Brown C.Y. Mize G.J. Pineda M. George D.L. Morris D.R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5631-5637Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The structures of the human and mouse L-mdm2 5′ leaders are diagramed in Fig. 1. Both uORFs in human mdm2 are 15 codons in length (including the termination codons) and share four codons in common (excluding the initiator methionine). Both uORFs are required for maximal inhibition of translation by the L-mdm2 leader, but uORF1 seems to contribute more to inhibition than uORF2 (5Brown C.Y. Mize G.J. Pineda M. George D.L. Morris D.R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5631-5637Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Two uORFs are also found in the mouse L-mdm2 leader (Fig. 1), suggesting that this conserved arrangement could have functional significance. The hORF2 and mORF2 sequences (hORF2 and mORF2 refer to the human and mouse versions, respectively) have diverged widely between the two species, whereas hORF1 and mORF1 are conserved in both overall length and coding at four of thirteen positions. Three of the four amino acids conserved in the peptide products of mORF1 and hORF1 are also conserved in hORF2 (alanine 5, proline 11, and arginine 12). Glycine is present in position 9 of uORF1 from both species, but not in the uORF2 of either species. The goal of the studies reported in this paper was to define those aspects of the structure of the L-mdm2 5′ leader that contribute to the distinct properties of mdm2 uORF1 and uORF2. Reporter Constructs—Chimeric expression constructs between the 5′ leader of the mdm2 gene and human growth hormone (hGH) as a reporter gene were detailed previously (5Brown C.Y. Mize G.J. Pineda M. George D.L. Morris D.R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5631-5637Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Building on our previously described construct, pGH-E1, by means of “back-to-back” PCR (12Hemsley A. Arnheim N. Toney M.D. Cortopassi G. Galas D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6545-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar), uORFs 1 and 2 were deleted from the 5′ leader and replaced with restriction sites MluI and StyI, respectively. The primer sets used (restriction sites in boldface) were, for the MluI site, 5′-GACACACAGGGCCACACAGGC-3′ and 5′-ACGCGTCCTGCTGCTTTCGCAGCCAGG-3′ and, for the StyI site, 5′-CTCCGGGCCAGGGCACTGGGC-3′ and 5′-CCAAGGCTGGGGAGTCTTGAGGGACCC-3′. The resulting construct enabled the insertion of specifically designed, double-stranded oligonucleotides in place of the wild-type uORFs. For example, wild-type uORF1 was inserted into the MluI site, and uORF2 was inserted into the StyI site, restoring the wild-type 5′ mdm2 leader sequence, with the exception of the restriction sites, through use of the following oligonucleotides (restriction sites in boldface, initiation site underlined, sense strand shown): uORF1, 5′-CGCGTGGAAAGATGGAGCAAGAAGCCGAGCCCGAGGGGCGGCCGCGACCCCTCTGACCGAGATA-3′ and uORF2, 5′-CAAGGAGTGGAATGATCCCCGAGGCCCAGGGCGTCGTGCTTCCGCGCGCCCCGTGAAGGAAAC-3′. Chimeric expression constructs between S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (AdoMetDC) and hGH were described previously (13Mize G.J. Ruan H.J. Low J.J. Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32500-32505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Using the unique BglII and HindIII sites flanking the uORF, double-stranded oligonucleotides encoding the desired uORF were inserted into the 5′ leader by standard cloning procedures. All constructs were sequenced prior to transfection to verify orientation and sequence of the uORF. Cell Culture—HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (50 μg/ml). The general procedures for generation of stable transfectants and sample collection for hGH expression analysis were described previously (13Mize G.J. Ruan H.J. Low J.J. Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32500-32505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), with a few modifications as follows. For expression analysis, 7.5 × 105 cells were plated in replicates (10-cm2 plates) in the absence of G-418 selection. On the following day, culture medium was changed using conditioned medium (13Mize G.J. Ruan H.J. Low J.J. Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32500-32505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and samples of the medium were removed immediately (T0) and after incubation for 4 h (T4). At T4, the cells were lysed using TriReagent (Molecular Research Center Inc.) for extraction of RNA. Measurements of growth hormone accumulation (T4 – T0) and ribonuclease protection assays for hGH mRNA level were performed as outlined below. Human Growth Hormone Assay—The level of hGH protein in the culture medium was analyzed with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit provided by Roche Applied Science. Duplicate aliquots were measured after dilution to within the linear range of the assay. Ribonuclease Protection Assay—The template for synthesizing the hGH riboprobe was derived by PCR amplification of a hGH cDNA kindly provided by R. Braun. Primers used were 5′-GTGGACAGCTCACCTAGCTG-3′ (upper strand) and 5′-CGCCGTACACCAGGCTGTTG-3′ (lower strand). The resulting PCR product was cloned into Bluescript SKII+ plasmid and sequenced for verification. After template linearization, the riboprobe was synthesized using T7 RNA polymerase (Stratagene). As an internal control, actin riboprobe was produced from the pTRI-β-actin-human plasmid (Ambion) and annealed to RNA simultaneously with the hGH riboprobe. Digestion with RNase A was carried out as described (14Ruan H.J. Brown C.Y. Morris D.R. Richter J.D. Analysis of mRNA Formation and Function. Academic Press, New York1997: 305-321Google Scholar). A 6% urea-polyacrylamide gel was used for electrophoresis, and phosphorimage analysis was used for quantitation. For each sample, the assay was carried out in triplicate, and the hGH mRNA levels were normalized to the levels of actin mRNA. Influence of Organization of the L-mdm2 5′ Leader on Translational Repression—Site-directed mutagenesis of the L-mdm2 5′ leader demonstrated previously that both hORF1 and hORF2 were necessary to achieve maximum suppression of translation of an associated reporter gene (5Brown C.Y. Mize G.J. Pineda M. George D.L. Morris D.R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5631-5637Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). To facilitate further analysis, unique restriction sites were engineered into the 5′ leader in positions flanking the uORFs (see “Experimental Procedures”), which allowed defined oligonucleotides to be cloned into the constructs in place of the wild-type uORFs. hGH was used as the reporter gene (15Hill J.R. Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21886-21893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in these constructs, and the data are presented as translational efficiency, which is defined as rate of hGH production normalized to hGH mRNA (13Mize G.J. Ruan H.J. Low J.J. Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32500-32505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In each experiment, the results were compared with a control construct in which the initiator AUG codons of both human uORFs had been altered to AAG (Fig. 2, construct X-X). As shown in Fig. 2, the L-mdm2 leader with both human uORFs intact (Fig. 2, construct 1-2) reduced the translational efficiency of the construct to 7% of the control. The activities of the constructs with just hORF1 (Fig. 2, construct 1-X) or just hORF2 (Fig. 2, construct X-2) were 19 and 66% of the control, respectively. These activities compared well with the corresponding constructs generated by site-directed mutagenesis; in three independent experiments, constructs from mutagenesis, which corresponded to 1-2, 1-X, and X-2, displayed translational efficiencies relative to the corresponding control-lacking uORFs of 8 + 2, 24 + 3, and 65 + 15%, respectively (data not shown). Therefore, introduction of restriction sites flanking the uORFs did not alter their regulatory properties. The above results demonstrate that construct 1-X, which contains only hORF1, has about one-third the activity of the construct with only hORF2 (X-2). To test whether this large difference in inhibitory activity was due to position within the 5′ leader, the locations of the two human uORFs were reversed, yielding constructs 2-1, X-1, and 2-X, as seen in Fig. 2). The general conclusion remained the same, i.e. hORF1 is much more strongly inhibitory than hORF2 irrespective of position in the leader and, therefore, the surrounding sequence (Fig. 2, compare X-1 with X-2 and 1-X with 2-X). When compared in the same position in the 5′ leader, hORF1 is >4-fold more inhibitory than hORF2. Substitution of sequence from the human β-actin 5′ leader between the two human uORFs in the L-mdm2 leader had no significant effect on its inhibitory activity (data not shown), reinforcing the conclusion that the surrounding sequence does not influence the inhibitory activities of the two human uORFs. There is a small contribution of position within the leader; proximity to the 5′ cap seems to decrease the inhibitory activity of both uORFs (Fig. 2, compare X-1 with 1-X and X-2 with 2-X). This may arise from the known decrease in recognition of an initiator AUG with increased proximity to the cap (16Kozak M. Gene Expr. 1991; 1: 111-115PubMed Google Scholar). As discussed in the Introduction, the mouse L-mdm2 mRNA also contains two uORFs. The human and mouse uORF1 sequences have some characteristics in common, whereas the two uORF2s are quite divergent between the two species (Fig. 1). When the two mouse uORFs were inserted into the human L-mdm2 leader (Fig. 2, construct M-M), suppression of downstream translation was quite similar to that observed with the human uORFs. The results of swapping the mouse and human uORFs to create hybrid constructs (Fig. 2, constructs H-M and M-H) suggested that the mORF1 is somewhat less inhibitory than hORF1, whereas human and mouse uORF2s have similar activities. Origins of the Enhanced Suppressive Properties of uORF1 Relative to uORF2—To examine the functional properties of mdm2 hORF1 in isolation, it was cloned into the AdoMetDC 5′ leader in place of the endogenous uORF. The regulatory properties of the AdoMetDC leader and its uORF have been well characterized (13Mize G.J. Ruan H.J. Low J.J. Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32500-32505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 17Law G.L. Raney A. Heusner C. Morris D.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 29576-29582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The activities of the mdm2 uORFs were compared in all cases with an AdoMetDC uORF sequence in which the initiator AUG codon had been inactivated by alteration to a GUG (Fig. 3, construct [ADC]). Also for comparison, we include a construct in which the regulatory activities of the AdoMetDC uORF had been abolished through changing a critical aspartic acid codon to arginine (Fig. 3, construct ADC[D/R]), thus illustrating, for comparison, the activity of a uORF with no unusual suppressive properties placed in the AdoMetDC 5′ leader (13Mize G.J. Ruan H.J. Low J.J. Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32500-32505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). There was 60% residual translation present in the ADC[D/R] construct, which probably resulted from translation of the uORF, followed by reinitiation at the downstream reporter gene (2Morris D.R. Geballe A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8635-8642Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). The human mdm2 uORF1, when introduced into the AdoMetDC 5′leader (Fig. 3, construct hORF1), inhibited downstream translation by 82% (18% residual activity), whereas the mouse uORF1 (Fig. 3, construct mORF1) was somewhat less inhibitory, consistent with the conclusion drawn from the human-mouse hybrid constructs (Fig. 2). Translational suppression by human uORF2 (Fig. 3, construct hORF2) was over three times less than suppression by hORF1. The activities of the uORFs assayed individually in this context were very similar to those found in the context of the native 5′ leader (Fig. 2), reinforcing the conclusion that the surrounding sequence does not contribute to the suppressive activities of these uORFs. The inhibitory activity of human uORF2 is very similar to the AdoMetDC uORF that was mutated to abolish its unique regulatory properties (compare constructs hORF2 and ADC[D/R] in Fig. 3). Conversely, it seems that the human and mouse uORF1s must have special properties that produce the observed potent inhibition of downstream translation. It seems that uORF1 must be translated in order to display these properties, because mutation of the human initiator AUG yielded a construct that is indistinguishable in activity from the uORF2 and AdoMetDC uORF constructs with mutant initiation codons (Fig. 3, compare the activities of constructs [ADC], [hORF1], and [hORF2]). Therefore, even though energy minimization analysis predicts a secondary structure for human uORF1 with a free energy of –15.8 Kcal (not shown), it appears that this putative structure does not contribute to the inhibitory activity of the uORF. Also consistent with this conclusion, simultaneous introduction of 11 synonymous alterations in the codons of hORF1, abolishing the putative secondary structure (ΔG = –0.7 kcal) and retaining identical protein coding capacity, had no effect on the inhibitory activity of this uORF (data not shown). There are two relatively rare codons within hORF1, i.e. those encoding proline 11 (CCG) and arginine 12 (CGA), which have frequencies in humans of 0.7% and 0.63%, respectively. To test whether these two codons were contributing to the suppressive activity of the uORF, they were changed to CCA and AGA, which encode the same amino acids and have frequencies of 1.67% and 1.15%, respectively. In three independent experiments (data not shown), this construct showed no significant difference in expression compared with the hORF1 construct, which contains the wild-type human uORF1. Therefore, the potent suppressive activity of hORF1 cannot be due to the presence of these two relatively rare codons. One difference between human uORF1 and uORF2 is the context surrounding the initiation codon. Whereas uORF1 in both human and mouse has a strong context (21Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3589) Google Scholar) with guanine at position 4, human uORF2 has adenine at that position. Substituting the dipeptide Ile2-Pro3 of hORF2 with Glu2-Gln3 (Fig. 4, construct ORF2[IP/EQ]), the same sequence as in hORF1, significantly strengthens inhibition of downstream translation (Fig. 4). Two other substitutions, alanine and valine at position 2 of hORF2, also strengthen the suppressive activity of the uORF by about the same amount (Fig. 4, constructs ORF2[I/A] and ORF2[I/V]). The only thing that these three codon substitutions have in common is strengthening the initiation context by introducing a guanine at position 4. Although hORF2 with the strong initiation context is still less suppressive than hORF1 (Fig. 4), these results strongly suggest that at least one factor reducing the suppressive activity of uORF2 is non-optimal initiation context. It should be noted that the hORF2 constructs with the optimal initiation contexts are more suppressive that the “generic” uORF, ADC[D/R] (compare Fig. 4 with Fig. 3), suggesting that this uORF2 may have some unique inhibitory properties of its own. Independent of the context surrounding the initiation codon, there is still an inherent 2-fold difference in inhibitory activity between hORF1 and hORF2 (Fig. 4). To locate the region responsible for this difference in activity, the human uORFs were divided into three regions (A, B, and C). Constructs were assembled in which these regions were swapped between the uORFs, and the resulting chimeras were tested in the AdoMetDC leader (Fig. 5). Thus, constructs A1B1C1 and A2B2C2 are wild-type hORF1 and hORF2, respectively, and these show the expected activities (compare Fig. 5 with Fig. 3). The effect of initiation context is important in interpreting these data; for example, the differences between A1B2C2, A2B1C1, and the corresponding wild-type constructs (hORF2 and hORF1, respectively) can be accounted for entirely by differences in initiation context (contrast the activities in Fig. 5 with those in Fig. 4). Therefore, constructs with the same regions A must be compared in order to identify other differences between the two uORFs. In this way, region B was identified as a dominant determinant of the differences in hORF1 and hORF2 activities. Comparison of constructs A1B2C1 with A1B1C1, and A2B1C2 with A2B2C2, clearly demonstrates that region B from hORF1 has greater suppressive activity (Fig. 5). The same conclusion can be reached with respect to region B by comparing A1B2C2 with A1B1C2, and A2B1C1 with A2B2C1. A similar analysis of region C leads to the conclusion that this part of hORF1 is slightly more inhibitory than the corresponding region from hORF2 (compare constructs A1B1C2 with A1B1C1, A2B2C1 with A2B2C2, A1B2C2, with A1B2C1, and A2B1C2 with A2B1C1). Although the difference in activity between the regions C is smaller than that found between the regions B and, in some cases, is barely significant, it is found consistently among the four comparisons. Therefore, the stronger translational suppression activity of hORF1 relative to hORF2 seems to be the cumulative result of several structural features. The first is the stronger initiation context present in hORF1. The second is the amino acid sequence of the peptide product of hORF1, primarily in region B, which contributes strongly to its enhanced activity. Thirdly, there seems to be a minor contribution of the amino acid sequence of region C. Thus, mdm2 hORF1 seems to be a member of the class of sequence-dependent uORFs, the activities of which are mediated by the encoded peptides (2Morris D.R. Geballe A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8635-8642Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Influence of Single-Codon Changes on uORF1 Activity—The results of swapping large regions of the two human mdm2 uORFs suggested that the exceptional inhibitory activity of uORF1 results, in part, from the amino acid sequence of the peptide product. To test this hypothesis, we introduced selected single-codon changes into hORF1 and examined the activities of the altered uORFs using the reporter gene construct containing the AdoMetDC 5′ leader, as above. The activity of construct A1B2C1 (Figs. 5 and 6) suggested that the central region of the peptide product was likely to play a role in the inhibitory properties of hORF1. Within this region, glycine 9 is conserved between the human and mouse uORF1s, but valine occurs in this position in human uORF2 (Fig. 1). Converting the conserved glycine to valine resulted in considerable reduction of the inhibitory activity of human uORF1 (Fig. 6, construct 1XG/V). Curiously, the moderating influence of the valine 9 substitution on inhibition by hORF1 was abolished by introduction of a second valine at position 5 (Fig. 6, construct 1XAG/VV). These relative activities of constructs 1XG/V and 1XAG/VV were confirmed with three independently transfected cell lines, and the average values are those presented in Fig. 6. The glutamate 4 and alanine 5 positions are conserved between human uORF1 and uORF2, as is alanine 5 in mouse uORF1 (Fig. 1). A double substitution of valine at positions 4 and 5 significantly reduced the inhibitory activity of human uORF1 (Fig. 6, construct 1XEA/VV), suggesting a role for this region of the peptide in inhibition. This was not identified in the experiment of Fig. 5 because of the conservation in this region between human uORFs 1 and 2. The activities of constructs A2B2C1 and A1B1C2 (Fig. 5) suggested that the carboxyl-terminal region of the hORF1-encoded peptide could play a role in the inhibition. Conversion of proline 11 and arginine 12 both to alanine (Fig. 6, construct 1XPR/AA) had no significant effect on inhibition by hORF1. This result suggests that these two highly conserved residues (Fig. 1) do not play a detectable role in the inhibitory activity of the peptide. Shortening the peptide by deleting the carboxyl terminal leucine had no appreciable influence on the activity of hORF1, nor did extending the peptide by one alanine residue (Fig. 6, constructs 1X-L and 1X+A, respectively). Oncogene mdm2 is highly regulated, probably because of the important role that the MDM2 protein plays in controlling p53 and other proteins involved in cell growth (22Daujat S. Neel H. Piette J. Trends Genet. 2001; 17: 459-464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 23Michael D. Oren M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 24Momand J. Wu H.H. Dasgupta G. Gene. 2000; 242: 15-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). The ramifications of deregulation of mdm2 expression are profound; oncogenesis as a result of overexpression, and lethality in the case of underexpression. Besides transcriptional control of mdm2 expression (25Juven-Gershon T. Oren M. Mol. Med. 1999; 5: 71-83Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), translation provides a second target for regulation of this key gene. At least one class of tumors results from deregulation of translation of mdm2 (5Brown C.Y. Mize G.J. Pineda M. George D.L. Morris D.R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5631-5637Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 9Landers J.E. Cassel S.L. George D.L. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3562-3568PubMed Google Scholar, 10Landers J.E. Haines D.S. Strauss J.F. George D.L. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2745-2750PubMed Google Scholar, 11Capoulade C. Bressacdepaillerets B. Lefrere I. Ronsin M. Feunteun J. Tursz T. Wiels J. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1603-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), which underscores the physiological importance of regulation at this second level. Two uORFs occur in the long form of mdm2 mRNA in both human and mouse, the two species for which we have information. Together, these uORFs have a major impact on translation of this form of the mRNA in HeLa cells (5Brown C.Y. Mize G.J. Pineda M. George D.L. Morris D.R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5631-5637Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar); however, uORFs 1 and 2 contribute quite differently to the net influence on translation. Several features of the 3′-most uORF, uORF2, cause it to have the weakest effect on translation in both species. Both human and mouse uORF2s have weak contexts for translation initiation, with adenine at position 4 in human and cytosine at the same position in mouse. In addition, as shown in this paper, features of the coding sequence of human uORF2 diminish its influence on downstream translation relative to uORF1. Also, the location of uORF2 in mouse, just 11 nucleotides downstream of uORF1 (26Fakharzadeh S.S. Trusko S.P. George D.L. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1565-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar), would contribute to diminished recognition by a reinitiation mechanism (2Morris D.R. Geballe A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8635-8642Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar), in contrast to human, where the distance between the two uORFs is 88 nucleotides (9Landers J.E. Cassel S.L. George D.L. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3562-3568PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, several features of the uORF2s of both mouse and human combine to weaken their influence on downstream translation. In contrast to uORF2, the structure of uORF1 in both species seems to be optimized for recognition and inhibition of downstream translation. The initiation context in both human and mouse is quite favorable, with guanine in position 4 and a purine located at –3. Additionally, the coding sequence of uORF1 contributes significantly to its inhibitory influence. This effect of the coding sequence is not due to secondary structure or the occurrence of rare codons. Instead, the strong influence of uORF1 on translation of downstream cistrons seems to be mediated by the structure of the encoded peptide. The central portion of the encoded peptide and, in particular, the glycine residue at position 9, seems especially important in the inhibitory activity of the uORF1 peptide. Human mdm2 uORF1 seems to fall into the category of sequence-dependent uORFs (2Morris D.R. Geballe A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8635-8642Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar) in that missense alterations within the coding region perturb the inhibitory activity, while synonymous changes in the codons have no effect. However, the behavior of mdm2 uORF1 seems more complex than that of other sequence-dependent uORFs that have been studied. With two of the best characterized uORFs, those from the mammalian AdoMetDC gene and the cytomegalovirus UL4 gene, their activities can be totally abolished by single-codon alterations (13Mize G.J. Ruan H.J. Low J.J. Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32500-32505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 27Degnin C.R. Schleiss M.R. Cao J.H. Geballe A.P. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 5514-5521Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which are thought to destroy direct interactions between the uORF-encoded peptides and their targets. In contrast, the only alteration in hORF1 that has been observed to completely eliminate its unique inhibitory activity is the replacement of the central block of four amino acids in generating the construct A1B2C1. Complexity in either the structure of the hORF1 peptide or its contact with its target is also suggested by the apparent functional interaction between residues 5 and 9. These residues are conserved as alanine and glycine, respectively, in human and mouse. Changing residue 9 to valine, as found at this position in human uORF2, reduced the inhibitory activity of hORF1, but the effect of this change was moderated by simultaneously introducing an alteration at position 5. The known sequence-dependent uORFs seem to act by inhibiting movement of ribosomes along the mRNA, trapping them on the 5′ leader. This probably occurs as a result of the interaction between the nascent peptides and their targets (2Morris D.R. Geballe A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8635-8642Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). With the UL4 and AdoMetDC mRNAs, the ribosomes seem to arrest at the termination step after completing translation of the uORF (18Raney A. Law G.L. Mize G.J. Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5988-5994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 28Cao J.H. Geballe A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7109-7114Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Therefore, with these two uORFs, the structural relationship between the critical residues in the interior of the peptide and the carboxyl terminus (termination codon) is vital in lining up the peptide with its target to achieve optimal inhibition; the addition or removal of even a single codon abolishes activity (discussed in Ref. 2Morris D.R. Geballe A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8635-8642Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). In contrast, another sequence-dependent uORF, that from the Neurospora arg-2 gene, arrests ribosomes at the elongation step (29Wang Z. Fang P. Sachs M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7528-7536Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 30Wang Z. Gaba A. Sachs M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37565-37574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and seems to be far less demanding in the position of the inhibitory peptide sequence relative to the termination codon. In this regard, human mdm2 uORF1 seems to be similar to arg-2 in that adding or removing a codon from the 3′ end of the uORF had no discernable effect on its inhibitory activity. It is noteworthy that the organization of the 5′ leaders of the human and mouse mdm2 mRNAs both feature two uORFs with similar properties. In both instances, uORF1 is quite inhibitory to downstream translation and, in fact, shows sequence similarities between the two species, whereas uORF2 shows no unusual inhibitory properties and is evolutionarily diverse. There are examples in both yeast (8Hinnebusch A.G. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 199-244Google Scholar) and mammals (3Harding H.P. Novoa I. Zhang Y.H. Zeng H.Q. Wek R. Schapira M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1099-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2415) Google Scholar) of cooperation between multiple uORFs that result in regulation of translation initiation. It is tempting to suggest that the evolutionary conservation of these two functionally similar uORFs may have resulted from use of this arrangement for translational control of the long form of the mdm2 mRNA under some set of physiological conditions yet to be defined. Although the two human mdm2 uORFs do not require specific surrounding nucleotide sequences to exhibit their individual inhibitory properties, additional translational control elements may exist in the L-mdm2 5′ leader. Recently, a binding site for La antigen has been identified in the intercistronic region that lies to the 3′ side of mouse uORF2 (31Trotta R. Vignudelli T. Candini O. Intine R.V. Pecorari L. Guerzoni C. Santilli G. Byrom M.W. Goldoni S. Ford L.P. Caligiuri M.A. Maraia R.J. Perrotti D. Calabretta B. Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 145-160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). This binding site is evolutionarily conserved between mouse and human and is necessary for activation of mdm2 mRNA translation by the BCR/ABL oncoproteins. If, as suggested by the authors (31Trotta R. Vignudelli T. Candini O. Intine R.V. Pecorari L. Guerzoni C. Santilli G. Byrom M.W. Goldoni S. Ford L.P. Caligiuri M.A. Maraia R.J. Perrotti D.

The presence of an IRES at the 3′ end of the L-mdm2 leader could provide a regulated mechanism for bypassing the inhibitory influence of the two uORFs. A regulated IRES might also account for the enhancement of translation initiation at an internal AUG of the L-mdm2 transcript, which generates a protein with altered biological properties (35Mendrysa S.M.

https://openalex.org/W1970495851,"Anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) disease is a rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (GN) resulting from autoimmunity against the Goodpasture antigen alpha3(IV)NC1. In addition to the well-characterized antibody contribution, a T helper 1 (Th1) response has been suspected as the culprit for glomerular injury. We induced anti-GBM disease in DBA/1, C57BL/6, AKR, and NOD mice with recombinant human alpha3(IV)NC1 to investigate the involvement of humoral and cellular autoimmunity. DBA/1 mice had crescentic GN 11 wk postimmunization with alpha3(IV)NC1. C57BL/6 and AKR mice developed a chronic disease course resulting in comparable kidney injury to DBA/1 mice within 6 months. NOD revealed only minor glomerular changes. The rapid course and the severity of the disease in DBA/1 mice can be explained by our immunological findings in their sera and splenocytes: 1) high antibody titers specific for the putative clinically relevant epitope of alpha3(IV)NC1 with Th1-type isotypes, and 2) a strong proliferative response and high amounts of the inflammatory cytokine IFN-gamma, secreted by splenocytes stimulated in vitro with alpha3(IV)NC1, with only low amounts of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Our in vivo and in vitro results provide direct evidence that the balance between Th1 and Th2 responses associates with the outcome of anti-GBM disease in mice."

The amino-terminal extracellular domain of the glucagon and GLP-1 receptors (140–150 amino acids) determines specificity for the carboxyl terminus of glucagon and GLP-1, respectively. In addition, the glucagon receptor core domain (7TM helices and connecting loops) strongly determines specificity for the glucagon amino terminus. Only 4 of 15 residues are divergent in the glucagon and GLP-1 amino termini; Ser2, Gln3, Tyr10, and Lys12 in glucagon and the corresponding Ala8, Glu9, Val16, and Ser18 in GLP-1. In this study, individual substitution of these four residues of glucagon with the corresponding residues of GLP-1 decreased the affinity and potency at the glucagon receptor relative to glucagon. Substitution of distinct segments of the glucagon receptor core domain with the corresponding segments of the GLP-1 receptor rescued the affinity and potency of specific glucagon analogs. Site-directed mutagenesis identified the Asp385 → Glu glucagon receptor mutant that specifically rescued Ala2-glucagon. The results show that three distinct epitopes of the glucagon receptor core domain determine specificity for the N terminus of glucagon.

Activation of GLP-1 receptors (GLP-1R) on pancreatic β-cells by GLP-1 stimulates glucose-induced insulin secretion. Given their biological functions in glucose homeostasis, both receptors are promising targets for the treatment of type II diabetes. GluR and GLP-1R belong to family B of the 7TM GPCRs, which includes the receptors for peptide hormones of the glucagon/PACAP superfamily: glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2), glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP), vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), growth hormone-releasing hormone, and secretin and other peptide hormones such as calcitonin, corticotrophin-releasing factor, and parathyroid hormone (PTH). The fingerprint of family B 7TM GPCRs is six conserved cysteines that form three disulfide bonds in the N-terminal extracellular domain (Nt-domain) (3Grauschopf U. Lilie H. Honold K. Wozny M.

The present knowledge about the structure and arrangement of the 7TM helices is based primarily on multiple sequence alignment analyses, although a functional coupling of conserved polar residues of the PTH receptor (PTH1R) suggests the existence of a cooperative helix-helix interface between TM2 and TM7 (6Frimurer T.M.

Structure-activity analyses of peptides of the glucagon/PACAP superfamily suggest that their entire length is required for optimal biological activity and that the C terminus is primarily involved in receptor binding, whereas the N terminus contains the residues involved in receptor activation (8Robberecht P.

The N-terminally modified glucagon analog desHis1Glu9-glucagon is a potent GluR antagonist, which emphasizes the importance of His1 and Asp9 of glucagon in activation of GluR (9Unson C.G. Macdonald D. Ray K. Durrah T.L. Merrifield R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2763-2766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The N termini of GLP-1 and exendin-4 are highly conserved, and the N terminus of exendin-4 is essential for activation of GLP-1R (10Thorens B. Porret A. Buhler L. Deng S.P. Morel P. Widmann C. Diabetes. 1993; 42: 1678-1682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, His7, Gly10, Phe12, Thr13, and Asp15 of the GLP-1 N terminus are important for optimal binding and activation of GLP-1R, and they are all conserved in exendin-4 (11Adelhorst K.

NMR structures of GLP-1, glucagon, and PACAP-(1–38) in lipophilic solvents or dodecylphosphocholine micelles agree that the central and C-terminal parts are α-helical, often with a central distortion of the helix geometry, whereas the N terminus is a flexible random coil (12Chang X.Q.

Interestingly, the N terminus of receptor-bound PACAP-(1–21) forms a specific β-coil structure, and the PACAP N terminus is important for receptor activation (8Robberecht P. Gourlet P. De Neef P.

The N termini of glucagon and PACAP are highly conserved, and thus the glucagon N terminus may form a PACAP-like structure upon binding to GluR. The isolated Nt-domain of family B 7TM GPCRs is sufficient for low affinity ligand binding, and it is a critical determinant of ligand selectivity (3Grauschopf U. Lilie H. Honold K. Wozny M.

The Nt-domain of GLP-1R binds exendin-4-(9–39) with high affinity, and therefore either the C-terminal extension of exendin-4 (the Trp cage) or divergent residues in exendin-4 and GLP-1 increase the affinity of exendin-4 at the Nt-domain of the GLP-1R relative to GLP-1 (16López de Maturana K.

Additional interactions with the extracellular loops (ECL) and the extracellular end of the 7TM helices may explain the high affinity ligand binding of intact receptors and provide additional determinants of ligand selectivity (17Holtmann M.H.

Peptides. 2001; 22: 1363-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The molecular information about receptor-ligand complexes of family B 7TM GPCRs is limited. A two-site binding model has been proposed for the ligand interaction with PTH1R, in which the PTH C terminus interacts with the PTH1R Nt-domain and the PTH N terminus interacts with the PTH1R core domain (21Chorev M. Receptors Channels. 2002; 8: 219-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Peptides of the glucagon/PACAP superfamily may follow a similar binding mechanism (14Inooka H. Ohtaki T. Kitahara O.

The conserved Asp198 in the boundary between TM2 and ECL1 of GLP-1R is important to maintain the binding site for the GLP-1 N terminus (23López de Maturana K. Donnelly D. FEBS Lett. 2002; 530: 244-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Specifically, Asp3 in the N terminus of VIP and secretin interacts with positively charged residues in the extracellular end of TM2 of VPAC1 (VIP receptor) and the secretin receptor, respectively (24Di Paolo E.

The corresponding Gln3 in the N terminus of glucagon most likely interacts with the extracellular end of TM2 of GluR (26Perret J. Craenenbroeck M.V. Langer I. Vertongen P. Gregoire F. Robberecht P. Waelbroeck M. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In addition, p-benzoyl-l-phenylalanine in position 22 or 26 of the secretin C terminus cross-links to specific residues in the Nt-domain of the secretin receptor (27Dong M. Asmann Y.W. Zang M. Pinon D.I. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26032-26039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Family B 7TM GPCRs selectively bind their natural ligands with high affinity, although they may bind homologous ligands with low affinity. GLP-1R binds GLP-1 with high affinity and glucagon with low affinity, and glucagon is a low potency full agonist of GLP-1R (22Runge S. Wulff B.S. Madsen K. Brauner-Osborne H. Knudsen L.B. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2003; 138: 787-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The GLP-1R Nt-domain defines almost completely the glucagon/GLP-1 selectivity profile of GLP-1R by selective recognition of the GLP-1 C terminus, and the GLP-1R core domain is not important for glucagon/GLP-1 selectivity (22Runge S. Wulff B.S. Madsen K. Brauner-Osborne H. Knudsen L.B. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2003; 138: 787-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In contrast, GluR has a very strong glucagon/GLP-1 selectivity profile and does not cross-react with GLP-1. The GluR Nt-domain selectively recognizes the glucagon C terminus, and the GluR core domain strongly determines specificity for the glucagon N terminus. These results encouraged a search for the selectivity determinants in the GluR core domain. Single-substituted glucagon analogs addressing four divergent residues in the glucagon and GLP-1 N termini were analyzed for their ability to bind and activate GluR. Loss-of-function mutations in glucagon were rescued by gain-of-function mutations in GluR. The results show that three distinct epitopes of the GluR core domain determine specificity for the N terminus of glucagon. Receptor Constructs—The cDNAs encoding the human GLP-1R and the human GluR were originally obtained from Dr. B. Thorens and Zymogenetics Inc., respectively, and subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO® (Invitrogen) (10Thorens B. Porret A. Buhler L. Deng S.P. Morel P. Widmann C.

Chimeric glucagon/GLP-1 receptors were generated by overlap extension PCR, as previously described (22Runge S. Wulff B.S. Madsen K. Brauner-Osborne H. Knudsen L.B. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2003; 138: 787-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Chimera A was composed of amino acid residues 1–144 of GluR and residues 148–463 of GLP-1R (22Runge S. Wulff B.S. Madsen K. Brauner-Osborne H. Knudsen L.B. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2003; 138: 787-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Chimeric receptor TM2 (ChTM2) was composed of residues 1–187 and 199–477 of GluR and residues 190–200 of GLP-1R. ChECL2 was composed of amino acid residues 1–273 and 321–474 of GluR and residues 276–322 of GLP-1R. ChECL3 was composed of amino acid residues 1–359 and 386–477 of GluR and amino acid residues 362–387 of GLP-1R. Site-directed mutagenesis of GluR was done using QuikChange™ (Stratagene). Plasmid DNA was generated and sequenced as previously described (22Runge S. Wulff B.S. Madsen K. Brauner-Osborne H. Knudsen L.B. Br. J.

The radioligand 125I-Glucagon (2.2 Ci/μmol) was prepared by the chloramine-T method, and 125I-GLP-1 (2.2 Ci/μmol) was prepared by the lactoperoxidase method (29Thorell J.I. Johansson B.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 251: 363-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar). Both radioligands were purified by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography. Cell Culture and Transient Receptor Expression—HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle' medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and penicillin/streptomycin (90 units/ml and 90 μg/ml, respectively). Cells were seeded in T75 flasks, transfected with 9 μg of DNA using the FuGene™ transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), harvested 24 h after transfection, and used for plasma membrane preparations or applied directly to functional experiments. Functional Assay—HEK293 cells transiently expressing the desired wild type or chimeric receptor were harvested and resuspended in assay buffer (Flashplate®; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) to a cell density of 1.8 × 106 cells/ml. Peptides were diluted in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.02% Tween 20. Cells (50 μl) and peptides (50 μl) were mixed in 96-well Flashplates® (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), gently agitated for 5 min, and incubated for 25 min at room temperature. The resulting intracellular level of cAMP was measured according to the supplier's manual, and data were analyzed by nonlinear regression analysis using Prism®, (GraphPad Software, Inc.). Binding Assay—Binding experiments were performed as previously described (22Runge S. Wulff B.S. Madsen K. Brauner-Osborne H. Knudsen L.B. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2003; 138: 787-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Briefly, a freshly thawed plasma membrane preparation of HEK293 cells transiently expressing the desired wild type or chimeric receptor was incubated for 2 h at 30 °C in the presence of peptide and tracer. Bound and unbound peptide/radioligand were separated, and filters were washed twice in cold incubation buffer and left to dry. Finally, the amount of bound radioligand was determined using a Packard γ-counter, and data were analyzed by nonlinear regression analysis using Prism®, (GraphPad Software, Inc.). The Glucagon and GLP-1 Receptors—In GLP-1, Ala8, Glu9, Val16 and Ser18 were substituted with the corresponding residues of glucagon. The GLP-1 analogs were analyzed for their ability to bind and activate GLP-1R. In competition binding, GLP-1 displaced 125I-GLP-1 from GLP-1R with an IC50 value of 1.1 nm, and the IC50 values of the GLP-1 analogs were similar to that of GLP-1 (Table I). Whole cells transiently expressing the human GLP-1R gave a functional response with half-maximal stimulation (EC50) of the adenylate cyclase at 12 pm GLP-1, and the GLP-1 analogs were full agonists and equipotent with GLP-1 (Table I). In glucagon, Ser2, Gln3, Tyr10, and Lys12 were substituted with the corresponding residues of GLP-1 (Fig. 1). The glucagon analogs were analyzed for their ability to bind and activate GluR. In competition binding, glucagon displaced 125I-glucagon from GluR with an IC50 value of 2.1 nm, and the glucagon analogs displaced 125I-glucagon with significantly higher IC50 values (Fig. 1A and Table I). Whole cells transiently expressing the human GluR, responded functionally with half-maximal stimulation at 11 pm of glucagon, and the potencies of the glucagon analogs were significantly lower (Fig. 1B and Table I). The results showed that the individual substitutions of Ala8, Glu9, Val16, and Ser18 in the GLP-1 N terminus with the corresponding glucagon residues had only subtle effects on affinity or potency at GLP-1R relative to GLP-1. Conversely, the individual substitutions of Ser2, Gln3, Tyr10, and Ser12 in the glucagon N terminus with the corresponding GLP-1 residues decreased the affinity and potency at GluR relative to glucagon.Table IBinding and functional experiments with GLP-1R, GluR, and chimera AGLP-1 receptorGlucagon receptorChimera AIC50 valuesEC50 valuesIC50 valuesEC50 valuesIC50 valuesEC50 valuesnMpMnMpMnMpMGLP-11.1 ± 0.5412 ± 4.2Glucagon2.1 ± 1.011 ± 4.31.2 ± 0.6017 ± 9.9Ser8-GLP-14.7 ± 0.9216 ± 1.9Ala2-glucagon30 ± 9.2160 ± 150.26 ± 0.1217 ± 2.8Gln9-GLP-12.7 ± 0.9712 ± 2.1Glu3-glucagon640 ± 180>10000.35 ± 0.1912 ± 3.5Tyr16-GLP-12.5 ± 0.527.9 ± 3.0Val10-glucagon41 ± 7.691 ± 162.3 ± 0.3524 ± 5.0Lys18-GLP-11.1 ± 0.278.0 ± 0.25Ser12-glucagon150 ± 14310 ± 1402.0 ± 0.3022 ± 5.3 Open table in a new tab Chimera A—The chimeric receptor, chimera A, consists of the GluR Nt-domain and the GLP-1R core domain (Fig. 1) (22Runge S. Wulff B.S. Madsen K. Brauner-Osborne H. Knudsen L.B. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2003; 138: 787-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The single-substituted glucagon analogs were analyzed for their ability to bind and activate chimera A. In competition binding, glucagon displaced 125I-glucagon from chimera A with an IC50 value of 1.2 nm (Fig. 1C and Table I). The IC50 values of Ala2-glucagon and Glu3-glucagon were lower than that of glucagon, whereas the IC50 values of Val10-glucagon and Ser12-glucagon were similar to that of glucagon (Fig. 1C and Table I). In functional experiments with chimera A, all of the glucagon analogs were equipotent with glucagon (Fig. 1D and Table I). The results obtained with GluR and chimera A showed that substitution of the GluR core domain with the GLP-1R core domain increased the affinity and potency of Ala2-glucagon, Glu3-glucagon, Val10-glucagon, and Ser12-glucagon relative to glucagon. Dissection of the Glucagon Receptor Core Domain—Small segments of the GluR core domain were substituted with the corresponding segments of GLP-1R. Ala2-glucagon, Glu3-glucagon, and Ser12-glucagon were analyzed for their ability to bind and activate three chimeric receptors: ChTM2, ChECL2, and ChECL3 (Fig. 1). In ChTM2, the extracellular end of TM2 of GluR was substituted with the corresponding segment of GLP-1R. In competition binding, glucagon displaced 125I-glucagon from ChTM2 with an IC50 value of 1.4 nm (Fig. 1E and Table II). The IC50 value of Glu3-glucagon was lower than that of glucagon, whereas the IC50 values of Ala2-glucagon and Ser12-glucagon were higher than that of glucagon. On whole cells transiently expressing ChTM2, Glu3-glucagon was equipotent with glucagon, whereas Ala2-glucagon and Ser12-glucagon were less potent than glucagon (Fig. 1F and Table II). The results obtained with GluR and ChTM2 showed that substitution of the extracellular end of TM2 of GluR with the corresponding segment of GLP-1R increased the affinity and potency of Glu3-glucagon relative to glucagon, Ala2-glucagon, and Ser12-glucagon. In addition, the affinity but not the potency of Ala2-glucagon had increased relative to glucagon and Ser12-glucagon.Table IIBinding and functional experiments with chimeric receptors and GluR point mutantsGlucagon receptor mutantsIC50 valuesEC50 valuesGlucagonAla2-glucagonGlu3-glucagonSer12-glucagonGlucagonAla2-glucagonGlu3-glucagonSer12-glucagonnMpMChTM21.4 ± 0.405.6 ± 0.770.25 ± 0.00665 ± 9.17.3 ± 1.681 ± 3811 ± 2.375 ± 15ChECL23.1 ± 0.8127 ± 14980 ± 4603.9 ± 1.516 ± 5.7150 ± 38>100020 ± 6.5ChECL31.9 ± 0.810.64 ± 0.27380 ± 11038 ± 156.9 ± 1.37.3 ± 0.54590 ± 17030 ± 34Val360 → Thr1.9 ± 0.3969 ± 42NDND11 ± 5.6240 ± 52NDNDVal364 → Ile1.4 ± 0.5422 ± 1.2NDND21 ± 12530 ± 240NDNDThr369 → Met1.4 ± 0.2624 ± 11NDND8.2 ± 2.069 ± 39NDNDGln374 → Arg1.1 ± 0.1036 ± 18NDND12 ± 1.9230 ± 110NDNDSer379 → Phe2.1 ± 0.9135 ± 13770 ± 81130 ± 2219 ± 9.4210 ± 56>1000570 ± 270Ala380 → dle1.4 ± 0.3038 ± 16NDND8.6 ± 2.3250 ± 75NDNDPhe384 → Thr1.3 ± 1.214 ± 13NDND90 ± 27600 ± 230NDNDAsp385 → Glu2.3 ± 1.00.85 ± 0.29680 ± 95140 ± 2897 ± 3123 ± 3.7>1000>1000 Open table in a new tab In ChECL2, the second extracellular loop and the extracellular ends of TM4 and TM5 were substituted with the corresponding segments of GLP-1R. In competition binding, glucagon displaced 125I-glucagon from ChECL2 with an IC50 value of 3.1 nm (Fig. 1G and Table II). The IC50 value of Ser12-glucagon was similar to that of glucagon, whereas the IC50 values of Ala2-glucagon and Glu3-glucagon were higher than that of glucagon. On whole cells transiently expressing ChECL2, Ser12-glucagon was equipotent with glucagon, whereas Ala2-glucagon and Glu3-glucagon were less potent than glucagon (Fig. 1H and Table II). The results showed that substitution of the second extracellular loop and the extracellular ends of TM4 and TM5 with the corresponding segments of GLP-1R specifically increased the affinity and potency of Ser12-glucagon relative to glucagon, Ala2-glucagon, and Glu3-glucagon. In ChECL3, the third extracellular loop and the extracellular ends of TM6 and TM7 were substituted with the corresponding segments of GLP-1R. In competition binding, glucagon displaced 125I-glucagon from ChECL3 with an IC50 value of 1.9 nm (Fig. 1I and Table II). The IC50 value of Ala2-glucagon was lower than that of glucagon, whereas the IC50 values of Glu3-glucagon and Ser12-glucagon were higher than that of glucagon. On whole cells transiently expressing ChECL3, Ala2-glucagon was equipotent with glucagon, whereas Glu3-glucagon and Ser12-glucagon were less potent than glucagon (Fig. 1J and Table II). The results showed that substitution of the third extracellular loop and the extracellular ends of TM6 and TM7 with the corresponding segments of GLP-1R specifically increased the affinity of Ala2-glucagon relative to glucagon, Glu3-glucagon, and Ser12-glucagon. In functional experiments, the potency of Ala2-glucagon and to a lesser extent Ser12-glucagon had increased relative to glucagon and Glu3-glucagon. We were unable to generate a chimeric receptor that specifically increased the affinity and potency of Val10-glucagon; therefore, Val10-glucagon was not analyzed further. Point Mutations in the Glucagon Receptor—The region defined by the GLP-1R segment of ChECL3 was investigated by site-directed mutagenesis of the corresponding segment of GluR. The divergent residues in this region were substituted individually to the corresponding residues of GLP-1R. Initially, the GluR point mutants were analyzed in binding and functional experiments with glucagon and Ala2-glucagon. In competition binding with the Asp385-Glu mutant, the affinity of Ala2-glucagon was slightly higher than that of glucagon (Fig. 2C and Table II). In functional experiments with whole cells transiently expressing the Asp385-Glu mutant, the potency of Ala2-glucagon was slightly higher than that of glucagon (Fig. 2D and Table II). With the other GluR point mutants, the affinity and potency of Ala2-glucagon were lower than the affinity and potency of glucagon, in a manner similar to GluR (Table II). This is illustrated by the Ser379 → Phe mutant (Fig. 2, A and B). Subsequently, the Asp385 → Glu and Ser379 → Phe mutants were analyzed in binding and functional experiments with Glu3-glucagon and Ser12-glucagon. At both mutants, the affinity and potency of Glu3-glucagon and Ser12-glucagon were significantly lower than the affinity and potency of glucagon. The results showed that the point mutation Asp385 → Glu in the extracellular end of TM7 specifically increased the affinity and potency of Ala2-glucagon relative to glucagon, Glu3-glucagon, and Ser12-glucagon. The glucagon analogs bound and activated GluR with lower affinity and potency than glucagon. Substitution of the entire GluR core domain with the GLP-1R core domain rescued the affinity and potency of all of the glucagon analogs relative to glucagon. In addition, the corresponding GLP-1 analogs bound and activated GLP-1R with the same affinity and potency as GLP-1. Apparently, the GluR core domain selectively recognized Ser2, Gln3, Tyr10, and Ser12 of the glucagon N terminus and discriminated the corresponding residues of the GLP-1 N terminus. In contrast, the GLP-1R core domain (GLP-1R and chimera A) potently accommodated both the GLP-1 and glucagon N termini, although the substituted residues in the GLP-1 and glucagon analogs may interact differently with the GLP-1R core domain than the corresponding residues of native GLP-1 and glucagon. Dissection of the GluR core domain identified three distinct epitopes of the GLP-1R core domain that rescued the affinity and potency of specific glucagon analogs. The extracellular end of TM2 (ChTM2) rescued Glu3-glucagon, ECL2 and the proximal segments of TM4 and TM5 (ChECL2) rescued Ser12-glucagon, and ECL3 and the proximal segments of TM6 and TM7 (ChECL3) rescued Ala2-glucagon. ChTM2, ChECL2, and ChECL3 did not compromise glucagon binding or potency, which confirmed the structural integrity of the chimeric receptors. Two nonexclusive explanations may account for these results: 1) the GLP-1R segments of ChTM2, ChECL2, and ChECL3 interact directly with Glu3, Ser12, and Ala2, respectively, and/or 2) the GLP-1R segments of ChTM2, ChECL2, and ChECL3 are required to maintain a local binding site conformation that accommodates the interaction with Glu3, Ser12, and Ala2, respectively. Nevertheless, it is difficult to explain the results without considering the proximity of the GLP-1R segments in ChTM2, ChECL2, and ChECL3 with Glu3, Ser12, and Ala2 of the glucagon analogs, respectively. In addition, the corresponding segments of GluR define the strong glucagon/GLP-1 selectivity profile of the GluR core domain by selective recognition of the glucagon N terminus. Most family B 7TM GPCRs have two positively charged residues in TM2, whereas GluR has only one and a neutral hydrophobic residue in place of the other (Lys187 and Ile194 in human GluR). Furthermore, the glucagon/PACAP superfamily peptides have either Asp or Glu in position 3 except glucagon, which has a Gln. The K187R/I194K GluR mutant rescued both affinity and potency of Asp3-glucagon relative to glucagon (26Perret J. Craenenbroeck M.V. Langer I. Vertongen P. Gregoire F. Robberecht P. Waelbroeck M. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The additional positive charge of the K187R/I194K GluR mutant and the chimeric receptor ChTM2 probably accommodates the extra negative charge of Asp3-glucagon and Glu3-glucagon, respectively. In fact, Glu3-glucagon bound ChTM2 with higher affinity than glucagon but was equipotent with glucagon in functional experiments with ChTM2. The small discrepancy in affinity versus potency suggests that Glu3 of Glu3-glucagon provides a binding determinant for interaction with ChTM2 that is not equally favorable for activation of ChTM2. However, the discrepancy is small compared with the total rescue of Glu3-glucagon by ChTM2. The corresponding Asp3 of secretin and VIP interact with the conserved Arg and Lys in TM2 of the secretin and VPAC1 receptor, respectively, and the interaction with Arg in the center of TM2 is important for receptor activation (24Di Paolo E. De Neef P. Moguilevsky N. Petry H. Bollen A. Waelbroeck M. Robberecht P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 25Solano R.M. Langer I. Perret J. Vertongen P.

Site-directed mutagenesis of a highly conserved His in the cytoplasmic end of TM2 leads to constitutive activity of several family B 7TM GPCRs (30Hjorth S.A. Orskov C. Schwartz T.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 78-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 31Schipani E. Jensen G.S. Pincus J. Nissenson R.A. Gardella T.J. Juppner H. Mol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 4990-4996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Collectively, it appears that TM2 is important for agonist binding and activation of family B 7TM GPCRs. Ile194 in TM2 of GluR may serve as a selectivity determinant that prevents access of homologous peptides to the activation site of GluR. The combined analyses of GluR mutants and single-substituted glucagon analogs demonstrated the functional significance of the correlated substitution of residues in glucagon (Gln3) and GluR (Ile194). Glucagon is highly conserved during evolution, and specifically position 3 is occupied by Gln in vertebrates except bony fish, where position 3 is occupied by either Gln, Asp, or Glu. In bony fish, glucagon and GLP-1 have overlapping biological activities, and GLP-1 acquired the incretin function after the divergence of bony fish and mammals (33Plisetskaya E.M. Mommsen T.P. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1996; 168: 187-257Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Specificity of receptor-ligand pairs most likely evolved to ensure distinct physiological functions, and therefore the change of selection pressure on position 3 of glucagon may reflect the divergence of the biological activities of glucagon and GLP-1. Eight divergent residues in the region defined by the GLP-1R segment of ChECL3 was investigated by site-directed mutagenesis of GluR. Only the substitution of Asp385 with the corresponding Glu of GLP-1R rescued the affinity and potency of Ala2-glucagon without disturbing the pharmacological profile of the other glucagon analogs relative to glucagon. It is difficult to explain the rescue of affinity of Ala2-glucagon by a direct interaction with Glu385 in the Asp385 → Glu GluR mutants. It seems more likely that the Asp385 → Glu mutation stabilized a local binding site conformation that preferably interacted with Ala2-glucagon. Nevertheless the results strongly suggest proximity between Ala2 of Ala2-glucagon and the extracellular end of TM7 of the GluR mutant Asp385 → Glu. The dissection of the GluR core domain provides three constraints that orient the glucagon N terminus with respect to the structural elements of the GluR core domain. Given the structural integrity of the GluR mutants in this study, we suggest a binding model in which Ser2 of glucagon is close to Asp385 of TM7, Gln3 of glucagon is close to Ile194 on TM2, and Lys12 is close to ECL2 and/or proximal segments of TM4 and/or TM5 (Fig. 3). The proximity of Ser2 with TM7 and Gln3 with TM2 is consistent with the potential helix-helix interface between TM2 and TM7 of PTH1R. Accordingly, the high level of amino acid identity of the predicted 7TM helices of family B 7TM GPCRs probably reflects an arrangement into a conserved helical bundle structure in which TM2 is close to TM7. Proximity of TM2 and TM7 is consistent with a rhodopsin-like arrangement of the 7TM helices, although the orientation may be either clockwise or counterclockwise (34Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le T.I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5054) Google Scholar). The position of ECL2 relative to the extracellular end of TM3 is probably constrained by a conserved disulfide bond of many family A and B 7TM GPCRs, and ECL2 is involved in peptide-agonist binding of family A 7TM GPCRs (34Palczewski K.

The NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (also known as respiratory complex I) is the first segment of the energy-conserving electron transfer chains of mitochondria and many respiratory and photosynthetic bacteria. This complex catalyzes electron transfer from NADH to ubiquinone and concomitantly translocates protons across the membrane to generate a membrane potential and proton gradient for ATP synthesis (1Anraku Y. Gennis R.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 262-266Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 2Walker J.E. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1992; 25: 253-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). Whereas the mitochondrial enzyme contains up to 46 different subunits (3Carroll J. Fearnley I.M. Shannon R.J. Hirst J. Walker J.E. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2003; 2: 117-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), the bacterial enzyme is made up of 13–14 subunits (4Friedrich T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 134-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) and thus can be considered as the minimal core complex I. The Escherichia coli NADH-Q oxidoreductase has been purified to homogeneity by liquid chromatography in the presence of detergent alkyl polyglucosides (5Leif H. Sled V.D. Ohnishi T. Weiss H. Friedrich T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 538-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) or dodecyl maltoside (6Spehr V. Schlitt A. Scheide D. Guénebaut V. Friedrich T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16216-16267Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The purified complex has a molecular mass of approximately 550 kDa and contains 13 subunits encoded by the nuo genes (7Weidner U. Geier S. Ptock A. Friedrich T. Leif H. Weiss H. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 109-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). This bacterial complex can adopt either a conserved L-shaped or horseshoe-shaped quaternary structure made of a peripheral arm and a membrane arm (8Böttcher B. Scheide D. Hesterberg M. Nagel-Steger L. Friedrich T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17970-17977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The horseshoe-shaped structure is believed to be the active form. Six subunits, NuoB, NuoCD, NuoE, NuoF, NuoG, and NuoI, constitute the peripheral arm (5Leif H. Sled V.D. Ohnishi T. Weiss H. Friedrich T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 538-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The remaining seven subunits, NuoA, NuoH, NuoJ, NuoL, NuoM, and NuoN, are hydrophobic proteins, which comprise the membrane arm. The peripheral arm can be subdivided into an NADH dehydrogenase domain composed of subunits NuoE, NuoF, and NuoG, which catalyzes the oxidation of NADH, and a connecting domain composed of subunits NuoB, NuoCD, and NuoI. The dehydrogenase domain contains the FMN-binding site and the EPR-detectable FeS clusters, N1a, N1b, N3, and N4 (5Leif H. Sled V.D. Ohnishi T. Weiss H. Friedrich T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 538-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), whereas the connecting domain contains the EPR-detectable FeS cluster N2 (5Leif H. Sled V.D. Ohnishi T. Weiss H. Friedrich T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 538-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) and the UV-visible-detectable clusters N6a and N6b (9Rasmussen T. Scheide D. Brors B. Kintscher L. Weiss H. Friedrich T. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6124-6131Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The subunits of the membrane arm contain no known cofactors, such as flavin or iron-sulfur clusters, and are thought to be involved in quinone binding and proton translocation (10Friedrich T. Weiss H. Baltscheffsky H. Origin and Evolution of Biological Energy Conversion. VCH Publishers, New York1996: 205-220Google Scholar, 11Friedrich T. Weiss H. J. Theor. Biol. 1997; 187: 529-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The mechanism of electron transfer and its coupling to proton translocation in NADH-Q oxidoreductase is poorly understood. Ubiquinone is the final electron acceptor in NADH-Q oxidoreductase and may take part in electron recycling and/or proton transport processes. Knowledge of ubiquinone binding is essential for mechanistic studies of this complex. However, the number of binding sites for ubiquinone in NADH-Q oxidoreductase is an unsolved question subject to intense controversy (12Vinogradov A. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 367-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 13Degli Esposti M. Ghelli A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1187: 116-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 14Brandt U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1318: 79-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Up to three sites have been proposed (14Brandt U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1318: 79-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Most suggestions derived from studies involving labeled inhibitor analogues. The Q-binding site has long been thought to be in the membrane domain of the enzyme due to its lipophilic nature. The ND1 in mitochondria (NuoH in E. coli) was identified as a quinone- and rotenone-binding protein by photoaffinity labeling using rotenone analogs (15Earley F.G.P. Ragan C.I. Biochem. J. 1984; 224: 525-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 16Earley F.G.P. Patel S.D. Ragan C.I. Attardi G. FEBS Lett. 1987; 219: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) and by mutational studies of human mitochondrial DNA (17Degli Esposti M. Carelli V. Ghelli A. Ratta M. Crimi M. Sangiorgi S.

Acta. 1998; 1407: 114-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The results of rotenone binding were used to indicate that ubiquinone binds to the same site. Recently, the inhibitor/quinone-binding site was postulated to be located at the interface between the peripheral and membrane domains of complex I and to involve subunits NuoH and NuoD (20Dupuis A. Prieur I. Lunardi J. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2001; 33: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 21Darrouzet E. Issartel J.P. Lunardi J. Dupuis A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 34-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This suggestion stemmed from identification of a missense mutation in the hydrophilic subunit NuoD of Rhodobacter capsulatus that conferred resistance of complex I activity to inhibition by piericidin and rotenone and from the assumption that complex I contains only one ubiquinone-binding site. Pyridaben is another potent inhibitor of complex I. Using a pyridaben photoaffinity ligand, the hydrophilic subunit PSST (NuoB in E. coli) was specifically labeled (22Schuler F. Yano T. DiBernardo S. Yagi T. Yankovskaya V. Singer T. Casida J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4149-4153Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). It should be noted that rotenone, piericidin A, and pyridaben inhibition of electron transfer from cluster N2 to Q is noncompetitive with Q. Therefore, the binding sites for these inhibitors may not be the same as that for ubiquinone. One way to unambiguously identify the Q-binding site(s) in complex I is to use azido-Q 1The abbreviations used are: azido-Q, 3-azido-2-methyl-5-methoxy-6-decyl-1,4-benzoquinone; Q1, 2,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-6-isoprenoyl-1,4-benzoquinone; Q0C10Br, 2,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-6-(10-bromodecyl)-1,4-benzoquinone; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; [3H]azido-Q, 3-azido-2-methyl-5-methoxy[3H]-6-decyl-1,4-benzoquinone; MES, 2-morpholinoethanesulfonic acid. derivatives that possess electron acceptor activity for complex I or competitively inhibit complex I activity with Q. The availability in our laboratory of a photoactivatable azido-Q derivative, 3-azido-2-methyl-5-methoxy[3H]-6-decyl-1,4-benzoquinone, which has partial electron acceptor activity for complex I, encouraged us to study the Q/protein interaction and to identify the Q-binding site in E. coli complex I. Herein, we report conditions for photoaffinity labeling of complex I with azido-Q derivatives and a detailed isolation procedure for the Q-binding peptide.

The ubiquinone derivatives, 2,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-6-isoprenoyl-1,4-benzoquinone (Q1), 2,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-6-(10-bromodecyl)-1,4-benzoquinone (Q0C10Br), azido-Q, 3-azido-2-methyl-5-methoxy[3H]-6-decyl-1,4-benzoquinone ([3H]azido-Q), and 5-azido-2,3-dimethoxy-6-decyl-1,4-benzoquinone, were synthesized by methods reported previously (23Yu L. Yang F.D. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 963-973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Enzyme Preparations and Assays—E. coli complex I was prepared and assayed essentially as reported previously (6Spehr V. Schlitt A. Scheide D. Guénebaut V. Friedrich T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16216-16267Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Complex I, azido-Q-treated or untreated, was mixed with asolectin at a ratio of 1:20 (by weight) and incubated at 4 °C for 15 min before assaying for activity. The reaction mixture (1 ml) contained 50 mm Tris-Cl buffer, pH 7.5, 5 mm NaN3, 0.15% dodecyl maltoside, 100 μm NADH, and 60 μm Q1. The reaction was started by addition of an appropriate amount of azido-Q-treated or untreated complex I. The oxidation of NADH was followed by measuring the absorption decrease at 340 nm, using a millimolar extinction coefficient of ϵ340 nm = 6.22 mm–1 cm–1. Identification of Endogenous Quinone in E. coli Complex I—Quinones were extracted from purified E. coli complex I with hexane as reported previously (24Redfearn E.R. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 381-384Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The concentration of quinone was determined by the method of Redfearn (24Redfearn E.R. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 381-384Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar). A millimolar extinction coefficient of 12.25 mm–1cm–1 was used as the difference in absorption of the oxidized and reduced forms of Q at 275 nm. Quinone identity was determined by matching the retention time of quinone obtained from complex I with those of reference quinones, Q2, Q6, Q8, and Q10, in a HPLC system using a Nova-Pak® reverse phase column (C18; 3.9 × 150 mm) from Waters, eluting with a linear gradient of methanol from 90% to 100% (v/v) in 20 ml at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. Photoaffinity Labeling of E. coli Complex I with [3H]Azido-Q—The dodecyl maltoside present in purified complex I was replaced with sodium cholate by repeated dilution-concentration using centriprep-30 as described previously (25Bader M.W. Xie T. Yu C.A. Bardwell J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26082-26088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Complex I, as prepared (specific activity, 0.301 μmol of NADH oxidized/min/mg of protein), was in 50 mm NaCl, 0.15% dodecyl maltoside, 50 mm MES/NaOH, pH 6.0. This complex was diluted with 1% sodium cholate to a protein concentration of 1 mg/ml in 50 mm K+/Na+ phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, and concentrated to 10 mg/ml by centrifugation for 30 min at 3,000 rpm, using a JS-42 rotor in a Beckman centrifuge J6-HC. The concentrated complex I was diluted again with the same buffer containing 1% sodium cholate and concentrated again to 10 mg/ml. This process was repeated eight times. The complex (specific activity, 0.267 μmol of NADH oxidized/min/mg of protein) was then adjusted to a protein concentration of 4 mg/ml in the same buffer containing 1% sodium cholate. 300 μl of this solution was mixed with 5 μl of [3H]azido-Q (9.0 mm in 95% ethanol) and incubated at 0 °C for 30 min in the dark. The specific radioactivity of [3H]azido-Q used was 9.7 × 103 cpm/nmol in 95% ethanol and 3.6 × 103 cpm/nmol in the 50 mm K+/Na+ phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1.0% sodium cholate in the presence of E. coli complex I. This mixture was transferred to a 2-mm light path quartz cuvette that was sealed with paraffin film and mounted on an illuminating apparatus. This assembly was immersed in ice water in a container with a quartz window and illuminated with long-wavelength UV light (Spectroline EN-14, 365-nm wavelength, 23 watts) for 10 min at a distance of 4 cm from the light source. NADH-Q oxidoreductase activity was assayed after reconstitution with asolectin, before and after the illumination. To determine the amount of [3H]azido-Q incorporated into complex I, illuminated samples were spotted on Whatman filter paper and developed with a mixture of chloroform and methanol (2:1, v/v) to remove non-protein-bound [3H]azido-Q. After the paper was air-dried, the origin spot was cut into small pieces and subjected to liquid scintillation counting. Determination of the Distribution of 3H Radioactivity among the Subunits of E. coli Complex I—The illuminated, [3H]azido-Q-treated sample was digested with 1% SDS and 1% β-mercaptoethanol at 37 °C for 2 h before being subjected to SDS-PAGE. The SDS-polyacrylamide gel was prepared according to Schägger and von Jagow (26Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar), except that bisacrylamide was substituted for the cleavable cross-linker, N,N′-diallytartardiamide. Electrophoresis was run at 30 V for 2 h and then at 80 V for another 6 h. After electrophoresis, the gel was stained and de-stained (26Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar). Gels were sliced according to the stained protein bands. The portion containing no protein was also sliced to the same size as that of the protein bands. Gel slices were completely dissolved by incubation in 0.3 ml of 3% periodic acid at room temperature for 1 h. 5 ml of Insta-Gel counting fluid was added, and radioactivity was determined. Isolation of [3H]Azido-Q-labeled NuoM—Part of the digest (see above) was subjected to preparative SDS-PAGE. A small portion (10%) of the SDS-digested protein solution was treated with fluorescamine (100-fold molar excess) for 10 min at 37 °C and placed in the reference wells, located on both edges and the middle of the gel. The SDS-PAGE gel and electrophoresis conditions were as described in the preceding section. The protein bands were visualized by the UV fluorescence in the reference lanes. The SDS-PAGE pattern of the fluorescamine-treated sample was identical to that of the untreated sample, as established by Coomassie Blue staining. The NuoM protein band was excised from the SDS-PAGE gel. The protein was eluted from the combined gel slices with an electro-eluter from Bio-Rad. Protease K Digestion of [3H]Azido-Q-labeled NuoM—Purified [3H]azido-Q labeled NuoM obtained by electro-elution was subjected to a repeated dilution and concentration process using centriprep-30 with a dilution buffer of 30 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, to remove SDS. The final protein concentration was about 1 mg/ml, with the SDS concentration around 0.5%. Protein was then digested with protease K at 37 °Cfor6h using a protease K:NuoM ratio of 1:50 (w/w). Isolation of Ubiquinone-binding Peptides—Aliquots (100 μl) of the protease K-digested NuoM were separated by HPLC on a Supelcosil LC-308 column (C8; 5-μm particles; 300 Å pores; inner diameter, 4.6 mm; length, 25 cm) using a gradient formed from 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and 90% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid with a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. 0.8-ml fractions were collected. For each fraction, the absorbance (from 200 to 400 nm) was recorded with a Waters 996 Diode Array Detector, and radioactivity was measured. Peaks with high specific radioactivity were collected, dried, and subjected to peptide sequence analysis. Amino Acid Sequence Determination—Amino acid sequence analyses were done at the Molecular Biology Resource Facility, Saint Francis Hospital of Tulsa Medical Research Institute, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, under the supervision of Dr. Ken Jackson. Effect of Cofactors on the Labeling—Aliquots of 0.94 nmol of NADH-Q oxidoreductase from E. coli in 50 mm K+/Na+ phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1.0% sodium cholate were incubated with [3H]azido-Q (18.7 nmol) for 30 min at 0 °C in the dark, and then NADH, NAD, or ATP (400 mm, final concentration) plus 1 mm sodium pyruvate were added for activation, and the incubation was continued for 30 min. Residual NADH was oxidized by l-lactate dehydrogenase (type II, from rabbit muscles) to NAD shortly before photoirradiation because it would quench the UV light responsible for photoactivation of [3H]azido-Q. Then, the mixtures were illuminated under UV light for 10 min at 0 °C as described above. Preparation of NADH-Q Oxidoreductase—NADH-Q oxidoreductase, prepared according to the procedure described previously (6Spehr V. Schlitt A. Scheide D. Guénebaut V. Friedrich T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16216-16267Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar), contains 0.5 mol of bound coenzyme Q-8 (ubiquinone-40)/mol of protein. When this preparation is titrated with exogenous Q0C10Br, no Q binding is observed, suggesting that the vacant Q-binding site(s) are masked by the detergent dodecyl maltoside or phospholipids and that the binding affinity of Q0C10Br is weaker than that of endogenous Q, phospholipid, and detergent used. Because the binding affinity of azido-Q derivatives to the Q-binding sites of several Q-binding proteins was reported to be weaker than that of 2,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-6-decyl-1,4-benzoquinone or Q0C10Br (23Yu L.

Chem. 2002; 277: 1649-1652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), study of the Q/protein interaction in NADH-Q oxidoreductase, using azido-Q derivatives, requires prior removal of endogenous Q from the complex and an unmasking of the Q-binding sites. When NADH-Q oxidoreductase is subjected to a repeated dilution-centrifugation/concentration process as described under “Experimental Procedures,” endogenous Q8 is partially removed (from 0.5 mol/mol of protein down to 0.2 mol/mol of protein), and the Q-binding site is unmasked. It is evident that unmasking occurs during detergent exchange from the binding of 0.7 mol of exogenous Q0C10Br to 1 mol of NADH-Q oxidoreductase. The binding of exogenous Q0C10Br was determined by titration according to the reported method (25Bader M.W. Xie T. Yu C.A. Bardwell J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26082-26088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The SDS-PAGE pattern of the cholate containing NADH-Q oxidoreductase is similar to that of dodecyl maltoside containing enzyme, except that a protein band with apparent molecular mass of 75 kDa becomes more apparent (see Fig. 1). This protein band was identified by partial NH2-terminal amino acid sequence analysis as a proteolytic digestion product of subunit NuoG. Because sodium cholate-replaced NADH-Q oxidoreductase has its Q-binding site unmasked, it is therefore suitable for use in photoaffinity labeling studies. When the purified and cholate-containing NADH-Q oxidoreductase is incubated with a 20-fold molar excess of azido-Q or 5-azido-2,3-dimethoxy-6-decyl-1,4-benzoquinone for 30 min at 0 °C in the dark and then illuminated with long-wavelength UV light for 10 min, only the azido-Q-treated sample shows inactivation, indicating that azido-Q is suitable for studying the Q/protein interaction in this complex. This azido-Q derivative was used previously to identify the Q-binding sites in succinate-Q oxidoreductases (27Lee G.Y. He D.Y. Yu L. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6193-6198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 28Yang X. Yu L. He D.Y. Yu C.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1985; 260: 963-973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) from several sources. Azido-Q Concentration-dependent Inactivation of NADH-Q Oxidoreductase— Fig. 2 shows that when NADH-Q oxidoreductase is incubated with various concentrations of azido-Q and illuminated, activity decreases as the concentration of azido-Q is increased. Maximum inactivation of 40% is obtained when 20 mol of azido-Q per mol of NADH-Q oxidoreductase is used. Inactivation is not due to the inhibition of NADH-Q oxidoreductase by photolyzed products of azido-Q because when azido-Q is photolyzed in the absence of NADH-Q oxidoreductase and then mixed with the enzyme, no inhibition is observed. Inactivation is also not due to protein damage by UV radiation because when the enzyme alone is illuminated, no activity loss is observed. Because the activity of the azido-Q-treated NADH-Q oxidoreductase, after illumination, is assayed in the presence of excess Q1 (60 μm), the extent of inactivation should be proportional to the fraction of the Q-binding sites covalently linked to azido-Q. Correlation between Azido-Q Incorporation and Inactivation of NADH-Q Oxidoreductase—To further confirm that the inactivation observed results from covalent linkage of azido-Q to protein in the complex, azido-Q uptake and the extent of inactivation were determined for different periods of illumination. As shown in Fig. 3, when the complex is treated with a 20-fold molar excess of azido-Q and illuminated for different time periods, activity decreases as illumination time increases; maximum inactivation (40%) is reached at 10 min. Moreover, the amount of azido-Q incorporated into protein parallels the extent of inactivation, until the maximum is reached, suggesting that inactivation results from binding of azido-Q to the Q-binding site. Although illumination for longer than 10 min causes no further decrease in activity, azido-Q uptake continues, but at a slower rate, indicating that this incorporation is due to nonspecific binding of azido-Q to protein. It should be mentioned that a control sample containing the same amount of ethanol, illuminated under identical conditions, shows little (<5%) activity loss over the time periods studied. Identification of Q-binding Subunit in NADH-Q Oxidoreductase by Photoaffinity Labeling with [3H]Azido-Q Derivatives— Because the uptake of azido-Q derivative by NADH-Q oxidoreductase upon illumination is correlated to the enzymatic inactivation, it is reasonable to assume that the azido-Q derivative is bound specifically to the Q-binding site(s). Thus, the distribution of the covalently bound azido-Q among subunits of NADH-Q oxidoreductase after SDS-PAGE indicates the specific Q-binding protein in this enzyme complex. Fig. 4 shows the 3H radioactivity distribution among subunits of NADH-Q oxidoreductase. The advantage of using the acrylamide/N,N′-diallytartardiamide gel system, rather than the commonly used acrylamide/bisacrylamide system, is that the gel slices can be completely dissolved in 3% periodic acid, and this solution can be used directly for radioactivity determination. The acrylamide/N,N′-diallytartardiamide gel system has been used to identify Q-binding proteins in a bacterial reaction center (31Marinetti T.D. Okamura M.Y. Feher G. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 3126-3133Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and in mitochondrial ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase (23Yu L. Yang F.D. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 963-973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The electrophoretic pattern of illuminated, azido-Q-treated NADH-Q oxidoreductase obtained with the acrylamide/N,N′-diallytartardiamide gel system is similar to that obtained from the acrylamide/bisacrylamide gel system; 11 major protein bands are observed in each (by Coomassie Blue staining). Radioactivity is found in protein band 5, suggesting that this subunit provides the Q-binding site. No radioactivity is found in slices from a gel loaded with illuminated buffer containing [3H]azido-Q and 1% sodium cholate. Because the amount of radioactivity in protein band 5 was directly proportional to the extent of inactivation of the oxidoreductase, participation of this protein in Q binding is established. This radioactive protein band in SDS-PAGE of the illuminated [3H]azido-Q-treated NADH-Q oxidoreductase is identified as NuoM, based on the identification of two NuoM peptides in the protease K digest of the labeled protein. Peptide peaks with retention times of 29.9 and 45.8 min obtained from HPLC separation of protease K-digested labeled protein have the partial NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of NH2-SAAGLFI- and NH2-LPDAH- corresponding to residues 351–357 and 244–248 of NuoM subunit, respectively. The identification of NuoM as the ubiquinone-binding subunit of NADH-Q oxidoreductase is consistent with the report (32Hofhaus G. Attardi G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3043-3048Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) that human complex I lacking the mtDNA-encoded subunit ND4, due to a frameshift mutation in the gene, has no NADH:Q1 oxidoreductase activity but has normal NADH: Fe(CN)6 oxidoreductase activity. ND4 of human complex I is the counterpart of NuoM of E. coli enzyme (33Yagi T. Matsuno-Yagi A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2266-2274Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Isolation and Characterization of Ubiquinone-binding Peptides of NuoM—In order to identify the Q-binding domain in NuoM through isolation and sequencing of an azido-Q-linked peptide, it is absolutely necessary that the isolated azido-Q-labeled NuoM be free from contamination with unbound azido-Q and completely susceptible to proteolytic enzyme digestion. [3H]Azido-Q-labeled NuoM was isolated from illuminated, [3H]azido-Q-treated NADH-Q oxidoreductase by a procedure involving preparative SDS-PAGE, electrophoretic elution, and repeated dilution/concentration with centriprep-30. The SDS-PAGE step removes non-protein-bound azido-Q adducts. The SDS conce"

This conclusion is based primarily on in vitro kinetic experiments using relatively low concentrations of profilin (1–5 μm). However, the cell contains actin regulatory proteins with multiple profilin binding sites that potentially can attract millimolar concentrations of profilin to areas requiring rapid actin filament turnover. We have studied the effects of higher concentrations of profilin (10–100 μm) on actin monomer kinetics at the barbed end. Prior work indicated that profilin might augment actin filament depolymerization in this range of profilin concentration. At barbed-end saturating concentrations (final concentration, ∼40 μm), profilin accelerated the off-rate of actin monomers by a factor of four to six. Comparable concentrations of latrunculin had no detectable effect on the depolymerization rate, indicating that profilin-mediated acceleration was independent of monomer sequestration. Furthermore, we have found that high concentrations of profilin can successfully compete with CapG for the barbed end and uncap actin filaments, and a simple equilibrium model of competitive binding could explain these effects. In contrast, neither gelsolin nor CapZ could be dissociated from actin filaments under the same conditions. These differences in the ability of profilin to dissociate capping proteins may explain earlier in vivo data showing selective depolymerization of actin filaments after microinjection of profilin. The finding that profilin can uncap actin filaments was not previously appreciated, and this newly discovered function may have important implications for filament elongation as well as depolymerization.

The finding that profilin can uncap actin filaments was not previously appreciated, and this newly discovered function may have important implications for filament elongation as well as depolymerization. Profilin is a multifunctional actin regulatory protein that binds actin monomers with a 1:1 stoichiometry. Profilin-actin complexes fail to form nuclei and, in the absence of preformed actin filaments, will not assemble into actin filaments. However, profilin-actin complexes can readily add to free barbed ends of actin filaments at rates similar to free actin monomers (1Pollard T.D. Cooper J.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 6631-6641Google Scholar). Therefore, profilin is widely regarded as a protein that promotes actin filament assembly (1Pollard T.D. Cooper J.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 6631-6641Google Scholar, 2Pring M. Weber A. Bubb M.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1827-1836Google Scholar, 3Pantaloni D. Carlier M.F.

Cell. 2003; 14: 118-128Google Scholar). The in vivo effects of profilin on the actin filament cytoskeleton, however, have proved enigmatic and are not readily explained by the known functions of profilin. Genetic experiments in which both profilin isoforms in Dictyostelium discoideum were deleted result in an increase in F-actin of ∼70% (8Haugwitz M. Noegel A.A. Karakesisoglou J. Schleicher M. Cell. 1994; 79: 303-314Google Scholar). Microinjection of profilin in Swiss 3T3 cells causes extensive depletion of filamentous actin, but cortical F-actin is selectively preserved (9Hajkova L. Bjorkegren Sjogren C. Korenbaum E. Nordberg P. Karlsson R. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 234: 66-77Google Scholar). Similarly, microinjection of profilin into normal rat kidney cells induces actin filament disassembly, selectively sparing actin in the cortex and contractile ring. Although monomer sequestration by profilin could be responsible for depletion of F-actin, the pattern of loss of actin was in contrast to the nonspecific depletion of filaments observed when other monomer sequestering agents, DNase I and vitamin D binding protein, were employed (10Cao L.G. Babcock G.G. Rubenstein P.A. Wang Y.L. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1023-1029Google Scholar), implying that monomer sequestration was not entirely responsible for these in vivo observations. Others have shown similar differential effects on actin filament populations, with reduced density of parallel actin bundles in Chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing profilin (11Finkel T. Theriot J.A. Dise K.R. Tomaselli G.F. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1510-1514Google Scholar). Another unique characteristic of profilin is its ability to bind to poly-l-proline. A number of actin regulatory proteins contain profilin binding sequences of the type XPPPPP (where X = G, A, P, or S) (12Purich D.L. Southwick F.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 231: 686-691Google Scholar). For example, vasoactive stimulatory phosphoprotein (VASP) 1The abbreviations used are: VASP, vasoactive stimulatory phospho-protein; N-WASP, neuronal Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein; pyrenyllabeled actin, actin labeled on Cys-374 with N-(1-pyrene)iodoacetamide. contains 16–20 profilin binding sites, and N-WASP contains 12 profilin binding sites. These proteins localize to regions of high actin filament turnover and are capable of attracting concentrations of total profilin in the millimolar range (13Kang F. Laine R.O. Bubb M.R. Southwick F.S. Purich D.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8384-8392Google Scholar). Although the relationship between free and total profilin in vivo has not been determined, there are data that suggest that the cellular content of polymerization competent profilin-actin complex is limited (14Babcock G. Rubenstein P.A. Cell. Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1993; 24: 179-188Google Scholar, 15Sanders M.C. Wang Y.L. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 359-365Google Scholar), raising the possibility that high concentrations of actin-free profilin are attainable locally. Previous in vitro studies examining the effects of profilin on actin filament kinetics have used profilin concentrations in the range of 0.5–5 μm. Cognizant of the ability of cells to locally generate much higher concentrations of profilin, we have examined the effects of profilin concentrations an order of magnitude higher (10–100 μm, final concentrations) than previously studied. Using an experimental design that simplifies kinetic analysis, we have found that profilin accelerates the off-rate of the barbed end in a concentration-dependent fashion. We have further discovered that high concentrations of profilin can competitively dissociate the barbed-end capping protein, CapG. These findings add two hitherto-unappreciated functions for profilin that may help to account for the multiple and complex in vivo changes in actin filament concentration and morphology attributed to raising and lowering cell profilin content. Materials—Rabbit skeletal muscle Ca2+-actin was prepared from frozen muscle (Pel-Freez; Rogers AR) in buffer G (5.0 mm Tris-HCl, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and 0.01% sodium azide, pH 7.8). Actin labeled on Cys-374 with N-(1-pyrene)iodoacetamide (i.e. pyrenyl-labeled actin) was prepared with 0.7 to 0.95 mol of labeling compound/mol of protein using the method of Kouyama and Mihashi (16Kouyama T. Mihashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 114: 33-38Google Scholar). Latrunculin A was purchased from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Human profilin, gelsolin, and CapG were produced as recombinant proteins as described previously (13Kang F. Laine R.O. Bubb M.R. Southwick F.S. Purich D.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8384-8392Google Scholar, 17Dabiri G.A. Young C.L. Rosenbloom J. Southwick F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16545-16552Google Scholar). CapZ was purified from rabbit skeletal muscle to greater than 80% purity as assessed by SDS-PAGE using the method of Casella et al. (18Casella J.F. Barron-Casella E.A. Torres M.A. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1995; 30: 164-170Google Scholar); because its concentration is imprecisely known, the stated concentrations are approximate, but all the data displayed here come from a single preparation, so relative concentrations are precise. Depolymerization Assays—In samples that did not employ a calcium-sensitive capping protein (CapG or gelsolin), a 10 μm stock of actin (10% pyrenyl-labeled) was converted to Mg2+-actin by the addition of 125 μm EGTA and 50 μm MgCl2. After 10 min, MgCl2 and KCl were added to final concentrations of 2.0 and 40 mm, and the actin was given 60 min to polymerize to make an F-actin stock solution. The procedure was identical for samples containing calcium-sensitive capping proteins, except that the actin was not converted to Mg2+-actin before polymerization. Depolymerization rates were measured after 33- to 100-fold dilution of the F-actin stock solution into identical buffer containing the stated amounts of capping proteins with or without latrunculin A. The initial fraction of G-actin in these samples was ∼1% (19Yarmola E.G. Parikh S. Bubb M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45555-45563Google Scholar). In some experiments, capping proteins were added at the time of preparation of the F-actin stock; the results of these assays were compared with the addition of capping protein at the time of dilution. In both types of experiment, the stated concentration of capping protein is the final concentration after dilution. Polymeric actin concentration was determined as a function of time after dilution by the measurement of pyrene fluorescence in 300-μl samples in a spectrofluorometer with excitation at 365.6 nm and emission at 386.6 nm. The initial rate of depolymerization was estimated by a linear fit to data corresponding to the first 15% decrease in pyrene fluorescence intensity. This method is justified on an experimental basis by excellent reproducibility and a theoretical basis because a linear rate of depolymerization is expected providing that the filaments are long enough that the filament number does not change during the initial time interval used for the calculation. Steady-state Fluorescence Measurements—A 15 μm stock of actin (4% pyrenyl-labeled) was polymerized by addition of MgCl2 and KCl to final concentrations of 2.0 and 40 mm, respectively; the actin was given 20 to 60 min to polymerize. F-actin was then diluted to 10 μm in profilin and gelsolin or CapG. The samples were incubated for 20 to 24 h at 22 °C, and steady-state readings were obtained in a spectrofluorometer with excitation at 365.6 and emission at 386.6 nm. Global Fitting of Depolymerization Data—The fitting procedure is an approximation based on several assumptions. Equations similar to those previously used to describe the interaction of profilin with both G- and F-actin (2Pring M. Weber A. Bubb M.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1827-1836Google Scholar) can be written for any other barbed-end capping protein, A+F(n−1)↔F;Kcc=k−lk+(Eq. 1) C+A↔CA;Kd(Eq. 2) CA+F(n−1)↔FC;Kelong=ke−/ke+(Eq. 3) C+F↔FC;Kcap=kc−/kc+(eq. 4) where A is the actin monomer concentration, F is the concentration of filaments of n actin subunits (or n – 1 actin subunits when specifically indicated), C is the concentration of capping protein, and the constants are the respective equilibrium dissociation constants for which the energy square, (Kcc)(Kcap) = (Kd) (Kelong) may or may not be satisfied, depending on how the steady-state condition compares thermodynamically with equilibrium. There is disagreement in the literature as to whether the energy square is satisfied for profilin, although the thermodynamic difference between the two possible pathways for addition of a subunit to F-actin is small in all reports (1Pollard T.D. Cooper J.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 6631-6641Google Scholar, 3Pantaloni D. Carlier M.F. Cell. 1993; 75: 1007-1014Google Scholar, 4Kang F. Purich D.L. Southwick F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36963-36972Google Scholar, 6Kinosian H.J. Selden L.A. Gershman L.C. Estes J.E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6734-6743Google Scholar). Qualitative interpretations of the depolymerization data in terms of a competitive binding model would be unchanged in the absence of a balanced energy square; however, the quantitative analysis would then be indeterminate, because any discrepancy in the results could be attributed to a deviation from thermodynamic equilibrium rather than a failure of the model. Also, the assumption of barbed-end capping by profilin is controversial in certain buffer conditions (20Gutsche-Perelroizen I. Lepault J. Ott A. Carlier M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6234-6243Google Scholar). When both profilin and another capping protein are present, Equations 2, 3, 4 are written for each protein with rate and equilibrium constants that are unique for each protein (for example, KPcap and kPe– for profilin, and KCcap and kCe– for the other capping protein). Typically, the rate constant for dissociation of capping protein from F-actin, kCe– (Equation 3), is slow, but this is not the case for profilin (6Kinosian H.J. Selden L.A. Gershman L.C. Estes J.E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6734-6743Google Scholar). To balance the energy square, a small value for kCe– must be accompanied by relatively weak binding to actin monomer or a corresponding small value for kCe+. Thus, monomer binding by a capping protein may or may not be negligible. Other assumptions can be related to these equations. We assume that the dissociation rate from the filament pointed end, kp–, is negligible, where the sum of the barbed-(kb–) and pointed-end (kp–) dissociation rates is equal to k– as defined in Equation 1. Under the conditions of our experiments, sequestration of monomeric actin by CapG is assumed insignificant. The concentrations of CapG used in our capping experiments were in the nanomolar range, orders of magnitude below the equilibrium dissociation constant of CapG for actin monomers (KCd ≅ 1 μm). The concentration of free profilin is assumed to be much greater than the concentration of actin filaments. In addition, the binding of profilin and CapG is assumed to be in rapid equilibrium with the barbed end with respective dissociation constants of KPcap and KCcap as in Equation 4. Finally, based on previous results (2Pring M. Weber A. Bubb M.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1827-1836Google Scholar, 4Kang F. Purich D.L. Southwick F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36963-36972Google Scholar, 6Kinosian H.J. Selden L.A. Gershman L.C. Estes J.E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6734-6743Google Scholar), the elongation rate for addition of profilin-actin complex, kPe+, is assumed to be approximately equal to k+. The dissociation rate for profilin-actin complex is kPe–. Then, competitive binding between profilin and CapG for the barbed end results in a quadratic equation for the concentration of free barbed ends, [F] as a function of the initial concentrations of profilin (P0) and CapG (C0), and the total concentration of filaments, [F0]: [F] = [(((P0 + KPcap) × KCcap + (C0 – [F0]) × KPcap)2 + 4 × (P0 + KPcap) × KPcap × KCcap × [F0])1/2 – ((P0 + KPcap) × KCcap + KPcap × (C0 – [F0]))]/2 × (P0 + KPcap). This result is substituted into the rate equation, d[A]/dt=k−[F]+kPe−([F0]−[F])=([F](1+P0/Kd))×k−(eq. 5) and the initial rate of depolymerization is fit for all values of C0 and P0. Fitting parameters include the dissociation rate of actin from the barbed end in the presence or absence of profilin, the concentration of filaments, and the dissociation constants for profilin and CapG from the barbed end. Note that although Equation 5 includes KPd for profilin and actin, given the stated assumptions including that of a balanced energy square, this is equivalent to fitting for kPe–. Profilin Accelerates the Rate of F-actin Depolymerization—In agreement with the theoretical considerations of Pring et al. (2Pring M. Weber A. Bubb M.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1827-1836Google Scholar), and the experimental observations of Kinosian et al. (6Kinosian H.J. Selden L.A. Gershman L.C. Estes J.E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6734-6743Google Scholar) for non-muscle actin, profilin accelerates actin filament depolymerization (Fig. 1). Lower concentrations of profilin resulted in lower magnitudes of acceleration, and a dose-dependent acceleration in depolymerization by profilin was observed (see Fig. 3). The concentration of actin monomer at the initial time point in the depolymerization data is very low; therefore, any monomer sequestering function of profilin should be negligible. In addition, we show that the observations of Kinosian et al. (6Kinosian H.J. Selden L.A. Gershman L.C. Estes J.E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6734-6743Google Scholar) cannot be explained by monomer sequestration by comparing the effects of profilin with that of another monomer sequestering agent, latrunculin A. At high concentrations, latrunculin A alone had minimal effect on the time course of depolymerization. Also, monomer sequestration by latrunculin A did not alter the acceleration of depolymerization by profilin. From Fig. 1, the dissociation rate constant ke– ≅ 6 × k– when the capping protein in Equation 3 is profilin. That is, depolymerization is accelerated by a factor of about 6 when barbed-end saturating concentrations of profilin are present.Fig. 3Dose response of profilin on the initial depolymerization rate for filaments capped by CapG. Dependence of the initial depolymerization rate of 0.1 μm 10% pyrenyl-labeled Mg2+ F-actin on profilin concentration in presence (closed circles) or absence (open triangles) of 8 nm CapG. Inset, the same experiment was repeated in presence of 15 μm latrunculin A, and the results are depicted with identical symbols.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Profilin binds less tightly to pyrenyl-labeled actin monomers than to unlabeled monomers (21Lal A.A. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10132-10138Google Scholar), creating a potential complicating factor in the interpretation of depolymerization data that are based on the direct measurement of the off-rate of pyrenyl-labeled subunits from F-actin. However, unlike a polymerization assay done in the presence of profilin, the effect of pyrenyl-labeling of actin on the depolymerization assay is easily predicted. Assuming that the Kd values for pyrenyl and unlabeled actins are different, but that pyrenyl-actin randomly copolymerizes with unlabeled actin (22Cooper J.A. Walker S.B. Pollard T.D. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1983; 4: 253-262Google Scholar), then pyrenyl actin subunits can only dissociate when unlabeled subunits are also dissociating. In the worse case scenario, pyrenyl-actin subunits at the barbed end might not bind profilin and would therefore dissociate at the normal, uncapped rate (k– from Equation 1). In that case, 9 of every 10 subunits from a 10% pyrenyl-labeled filament would be dissociating at the rate of unlabeled subunits, and the difference between observed dissociation rates in the presence and absence of profilin would still be 90% of what it would be if profilin bound identically to pyrenyl-labeled and unlabeled subunits. Thus, the effect of pyrenyl-labeling should be small. An increase to 50% pyrenyl-labeled actin in the depolymerization assay yielded results similar to those displayed in Fig. 1, suggesting that the magnitude of any artifact introduced by a difference in affinity is small (data not shown). Additionally, consistent with the pyrene fluorescence data, experiments using light scattering (with detection at 350 nm at a right angle to the incident light) also showed acceleration of depolymerization by profilin (data not shown). Profilin Prevents CapG from Blocking the Depolymerization of F-actin, and the Data Are Qualitatively Compatible with a Competitive Binding Model—CapG prevents actin depolymerization as reported (23Young C.L. Feierstein A. Southwick F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13997-14002Google Scholar), but addition of sufficient profilin can reverse this effect (Fig. 2). Addition of latrunculin A shows that this result is not related to monomer sequestration. At 40 μm profilin, depolymerization data with or without CapG are superimposable. The observation that the depolymerization rates with or without CapG converge at saturating concentrations of profilin (Fig. 3) is consistent with competitive binding between CapG and profilin for the barbed end of actin filaments. Alternatively, these data are also consistent with the hypothesis that profilin and CapG form a heterocomplex at the barbed end that has the same dissociation rate constant as profilin alone bound at the same end. As depicted in Figs. 2 and 3, the dissociation rate constant ke– ≅ 4 × k–. We attribute the differences between this result and that of Fig. 1 to limitations in the experimental method such that collection of data does not begin precisely at the time of dilution; rather, it begins after the sample is mixed and placed in the fluorometer. The uncertainty in this value is acknowledged in our stated conclusions. Profilin Has No Effect on the Depolymerization of Filaments Capped in Advance by CapZ or Gelsolin but Has Similar Time-dependent Effects on the Capping Activity of These Proteins—In contrast to the results with CapG, profilin has no effect on the depolymerization of filaments capped by gelsolin, even at substantially higher concentrations of profilin (Fig. 4A), even though CapG and gelsolin are members of the same family of proteins that presumably cap filaments by similar mechanisms (24Southwick F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 45-48Google Scholar). The depolymerization rate for the control curve in Fig. 4A is relatively constant, a result that does not coincide with theoretical predictions of filament length that imply that all filament lengths should be equally represented at steady-state in the presence of gelsolin (25Ermentrout G.B. Edelstein-Keshet L. Bull. Math. Biol. 1998; 60: 477-503Google Scholar). Rather, these data are most simply interpreted as uniform depolymerization of filaments of similar length, and there are data in the literature that support this interpretation for low ratios of actin to gelsolin (e.g. 64:1) (26Janmey P.A. Peetermans J. Zaner K.S. Stossel T.P. Tanaka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8357-8362Google Scholar). In this case, competition by profilin would be expected to result in an increase in the rate of depolymerization as a function of time. This is not observed even at highest final concentration of profilin (98 μm). From these data, it is not possible to conclusively determine whether fundamentally different mechanisms explain the experimental differences between CapG and gelsolin. The off-rate of gelsolin is slow; half-time for release is reportedly in the range of 7 × 103 sec (27Selve N. Wegner A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 155: 397-401Google Scholar), although our own data suggest that it is somewhat faster. Because profilin has no chance to compete with pre-existing capped ends until the capping protein releases from the filament, competition under these circumstances becomes experimentally undetectable except with prolonged observation. Although the duration of the observations in Fig. 4A would probably permit detection of competition based on the reported value of t½ for gelsolin, the observed results may be explained by (1Pollard T.D. Cooper J.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 6631-6641Google Scholar) a longer-than-expected t½, (2Pring M. Weber A. Bubb M.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1827-1836Google Scholar) an equilibrium dissociation constant of profilin for the barbed end sufficiently high that the amount of profilin does not achieve saturation, or (3Pantaloni D. Carlier M.F. Cell. 1993; 75: 1007-1014Google Scholar) non-competitive or independent binding. In contrast, the dissociation rate constant for CapG can be estimated, as in Ref. 28Young C.L. Southwick F.S. Weber A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2232-2240Google Scholar, from an estimate of the association rate and the equilibrium association constant. From data not shown, equilibration for the association reaction occurs in less than 15 s in 4 nm CapG, corresponding to an upper limit on t½ for dissociation of CapG of 160 s. This upper limit is within an order of magnitude of the value for t½, necessary if competitive binding is a plausible explanation for the convergence of data for the time course of depolymerization of filaments with or without CapG under conditions of saturation by profilin. If CapZ, a ubiquitous heterodimeric, barbed-end capping protein, was allowed to reach a steady-state interaction with actin filaments before depolymerization, then, similar to the results with gelsolin, profilin was unable to augment the depolymerization rate (Fig. 4B). The dissociation rate of CapZ from barbed ends is reportedly 4 × 10–4 s–1 (29DiNubile M.J. Cassimeris L. Joyce M. Zigmond S.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1659-1671Google Scholar, 30Schafer D.A. Jennings P.B. Cooper J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 169-179Google Scholar) or half-time of ∼2 × 103 s; therefore, as for gelsolin, the data shown in Fig. 4B should be sufficient to detect competitive binding by profilin. In other samples, depolymerization rates of filaments capped by CapZ plus and minus profilin were collected for up to 3 × 103 s and these data did not reveal evidence that saturating amounts of profilin cause the rate of depolymerization to increase as a function of time. The results of depolymerization assays were dependent on when filaments were capped by gelsolin or by CapZ (Fig. 4, B and C). In contrast to the results when capping protein was allowed to pre-equilibrate with F-actin, if the capping protein was mixed with F-actin at the time of initiation of depolymerization, then profilin did alter the depolymerization rate. In this case, a short time interval with rapid depolymerization was followed by a return to the same slow rate observed in the absence of profilin. For both gelsolin and CapZ, higher ratios of capping protein to actin lessen the duration and rate of rapid depolymerization. The simplest explanation for these results is that profilin depolymerizes actin during the initial period before CapZ is bound, but after this initial period, profilin cannot affect depolymerization kinetics. Results in Fig. 4C show that gelsolin and CapZ have similar effects when added to F-actin at the same time as profilin. Difference curves for the depolymerization rates obtained in the presence and absence of profilin are superimposable for gelsolin and CapZ. The actual depolymerization curves for gelsolin and CapZ differ only because the gelsolin curves have steeper slope after ∼100 s because of the combined severing and capping activity of gelsolin, resulting in more pointed ends from which subunits can dissociate (27Selve N. Wegner A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 155: 397-401Google Scholar). Steady-state Data and a Global Fit to the Depolymerization Data Are Consistent with Competitive Binding of Profilin and CapG for the Barbed Ends of Filaments—The steady-state data are representative of three independent assays completed with three different actin preparations (Fig. 5). In all cases, the data for 0 μm profilin are indistinguishable for CapG or Gelsolin; in all cases, however, there is significantly more F-actin in the CapG-containing samples at high concentrations of profilin relative to those samples with gelsolin. Qualitatively, the data are consistent with competitive binding in that increasing profilin concentration reverses the capping effect of CapG, thereby lowering the critical concentration and increasing the amount of F actin. Quantitatively the data are more difficult to assess because the lower critical concentration probably originates both from the loss of capping by CapG and by direct effects of profilin on the critical concentration of uncapped barbed ends (3Pantaloni D. Carlier M.F. Cell. 1993; 75: 1007-1014Google Scholar). Neither the dose response of the critical concentration to profilin nor the dependence of these effects on the fraction of uncapped ends have been previously determined. Increasing concentrations of profilin reverse capping by CapG and increasing CapG concentrations reverse acceleration of depolymerization by profilin (Fig. 6). Saturating levels of CapG are easily achieved that show convergence of the data in the presence or absence of profilin, consistent with competitive binding. Because of the relatively lower affinity of profilin, convergence at saturation with profilin is more difficult to prove, but the data are also qualitatively consistent with the interpretation of competitive binding. From a quantitative perspective, all data for depolymerization, either at fixed profilin or at fixed CapG concentrations, can be fit relatively well simultaneously using a single set of binding parameters (Fig. 6). The robust fit over a wide range of experimental variables is based on several assumptions that are outlined in the methods section. Parameters used to fit these data included the dissociation rate of actin from the barbed end in the presence (1.72 s–1) or absence (0.32 s–1) of profilin (ke– ≅ 5.4 × k–). These values are generally in good agreement with previous reports (2Pring M. Weber A. Bubb M.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1827-1836Google Scholar, 4Kang F. Purich D.L. Southwick F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36963-36972Google Scholar, 6Kinosian H.J. Selden L.A. Gershman L.C. Estes J.E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6734-6743Google Scholar) although the relative acceleration of depolymerization rate by profilin was predicted to be greater than 500-fold for Acanthamoeba castellanii actin (2Pring M. Weber A. Bubb M.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1827-1836Google Scholar). The concentration of filaments, [F], was 0.83 nm; to our knowledge, this represents the first attempt to calculate [F] by this method. The dissociation constants for profilin (KPcap) and CapG (KCcap) from the barbed end were 2.2 μm and 0.033 nm, respectively. Different preparations of CapG were used to obtain the data in Figs. 3 and 6, with an 8-fold higher affinity noted for the CapG used in Fig. 6. We do not have an explanation for the variation between preparations, but note that the fit to the data accommodates relatively large variations in KCcap and that all data were consistent with the interpretation of competitive binding. Depolymerization of Actin by Profilin—Concentrations of profilin within the cytoplasm of mammalian cells have been estimated to range from 10 μm in less motile cells such as endothelial cells (31Moldovan N.I. Milliken E.E. Irani K. Chen J. Sohn R.H. Finkel T. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 24-30Google Scholar) to 60 μm in highly motile cells such as polymorphonuclear leukocytes (32Southwick F.S. Young C.L. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1965-1973Google Scholar). Furthermore, studies of actin-based motility of Listeria monocytogenes (33Cossart P. Bierne H. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2001; 13: 96-103Google Scholar, 34Portnoy D.A. Auerbuch V. Glomski I.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 409-414Google Scholar) as well as Shigella flexneri (35Sansonetti P.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: G319-G323Google Scholar, 36Suzuki T. Sasakawa C. Infect Immun. 2001; 69: 5959-5966Google Scholar) have emphasized the potential importance of actin-regulatory proteins that can attract VASP and N-WASP to regions of rapid actin filament turnover. Because of the multiple profilin binding sites on VASP and N-WASP, these protein complexes can attract concentrations of profilin that approach the millimolar range (13Kang F. Laine R.O. Bubb M.R. Southwick F.S. Purich D.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8384-8392Google Scholar). To understand how profilin functions in the living cells in vitro actin kinetics need to be performed at profilin concentrations likely to be found in the cell. Experiments with such high concentrations of profilin, however, are challenging, because profilin sequesters significant concentrations of monomeric actin under these conditions. Initial attempts at assembly and disassembly experiments using spectrin-4.1 nucleated filaments to limit monomer exchange to free, barbed filament ends resulted in rapid destabilization of the spectrin-4.1 nuclei at these high profilin concentrations (10–40 μm). Our results show that the actin subunit off-rate in the presence of saturating concentrations of profilin is 4 to 6 times that observed in the absence of profilin. This corresponds to the measured ratio of dissociation rate constants for profilin-actin to that for actin alone. This result was first predicted by Pring et al., but could not be confirmed using A. castellani actin (2Pring M. Weber A. Bubb M.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1827-1836Google Scholar). We speculated then that it could not be confirmed because the terminal nucleotides on the barbed end of F-actin were different during depolymerization and elongation. However, Teuber and Wegner later suggested that the terminal nucleotide exchanges at a rate of 20 s–1 (37Teubner A. Wegner A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7532-7538Google Scholar), significantly higher than the subunit dissociation rate in either the presence or absence of profilin, and the barbed-end terminal subunit would therefore be expected to be ATP under both elongation and depolymerization conditions. In retrospect, the explanation for the failure to detect enhanced depolymerization was either that the profilin concentration was not sufficiently high or that the observation is not valid for A. castellani proteins. The first experimental data confirming that profilin can increase depolymerization rates was provided by Kinosian et al. (6Kinosian H.J. Selden L.A. Gershman L.C. Estes J.E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6734-6743Google Scholar) for non-muscle actin. Under conditions in which free profilin is assumed to cap the barbed end of filaments, the dissociation rate of profilin-actin from the barbed end has been indirectly calculated at 5.5 to 550 times the dissociation rate of actin from uncapped filaments (2Pring M. Weber A. Bubb M.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1827-1836Google Scholar, 4Kang F. Purich D.L. Southwick F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36963-36972Google Scholar, 6Kinosian H.J. Selden L.A. Gershman L.C. Estes J.E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6734-6743Google Scholar). It is very likely that the in vivo function of profilin is complex, and profilin may have activities that augment barbed-end filament dynamics during both filament assembly and disassembly. The observation that a reduction in profilin suppresses the phenotype of capping protein mutants in Drosophila melanogaster (7Hopmann R. Miller K.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 118-128Google Scholar) can be interpreted as promotion of actin polymerization by profilin. However, in a more general sense, if profilin promotes filament dynamics at free barbed filament ends, then the absence of profilin may simply dampen the effects of the loss of regulated capping activity, thereby lessening the severity of the phenotype. Filament Uncapping by Profilin—When filaments are capped by CapG, profilin enhances depolymerization by both uncapping and augmenting the actin subunit off-rate. Depolymerization data for filaments capped by CapG are consistent with competition between profilin and CapG for the filament ends. As expected with competitive binding, the data converge for samples with and without CapG at saturation by profilin. Like other postulated mechanisms, this novel method of uncapping actin filaments lowers the concentration of free actin at steady state (Fig. 5). Steric effects could explain competitive binding at the barbed end. The binding surfaces for gelsolin segment 1, and presumably segment 1 of CapG, which possesses high homology to this region of gelsolin, differ from profilin; however, both profilin and gelsolin segment 1 cannot occupy these binding sites simultaneously without some overlap of the ligands (38McLaughlin P.J. Gooch J.T. Mannherz H.G. Weeds A.G. Nature. 1993; 364: 685-692Google Scholar, 39Schutt C.E. Myslik J.C. Rozycki M.D. Goonesekere N.C. Lindberg U. Nature. 1993; 365: 810-816Google Scholar). The steric effect of intact gelsolin or CapG can only be greater relative to that of segment 1. Alternatively, profilin has notable allosteric effects on actin structure that could affect binding by gelsolin and CapG (19Yarmola E.G. Parikh S. Bubb M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45555-45563Google Scholar). More complicated alternatives to competitive binding could be postulated. However, the simple formation of a ternary complex of profilin, CapG and actin at the barbed end is unlikely. Such a ternary complex would be expected to exhibit similar behavior when profilin adds to CapG-actin filaments and when CapG adds to profilin-actin filaments, but this is not the case, as demonstrated in Fig. 6 by the different end-points at saturating concentrations of profilin or of CapG. Whereas the data presented here are consistent with a simple model of competitive binding, CapG may interact with more than one site on an actin filament during capping (24Southwick F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 45-48Google Scholar), so that the range of possible interactions with actin monomer and filaments are much greater than delineated in this model. The model is very likely to be an imprecise description of the actual mechanism. Similar uncapping was not observed for CapZ or gelsolin. This difference is likely to be the consequence of the slow off rates of both these capping proteins. This differential effect of profilin on capping protein function may help to explain the variation in sensitivity of different actin filament populations to raising and lowering the profilin concentration in vivo (9Hajkova L. Bjorkegren Sjogren C. Korenbaum E. Nordberg P. Karlsson R. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 234: 66-77Google Scholar, 10Cao L.G. Babcock G.G. Rubenstein P.A. Wang Y.L. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1023-1029Google Scholar, 11Finkel T. Theriot J.A. Dise K.R. Tomaselli G.F. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1510-1514Google Scholar). The relevance of results showing rapid depolymerization of actin by profilin when filaments are diluted into gelsolin or CapZ is speculative. At concentrations of filaments and free capping protein-β2 (a homologue of CapZ) reported in neutrophil lysates (29DiNubile M.J. Cassimeris L. Joyce M. Zigmond S.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1659-1671Google Scholar), the half-time for capping of a filament is less than a second, and no more than 6 subunits can be expected to dissociate before capping in the presence of saturating profilin. On the other hand, if CapZ and/or gelsolin equilibrates with filaments in live cells, then the free concentration of capping proteins may be 3 orders of magnitude less than observed in the neutrophil lysates, and capping of free ends would be slow enough to permit significant filament depolymerization by free profilin. Partial depolymerization of actin may be sufficient to cause extensive disruption of filament networks (40Janmey P.A. Hvidt S. Peetermans J. Lamb J. Ferry J.D. Stossel T.P. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8218-8227Google Scholar) and, in concert with actin filament-severing proteins, may enhance actin gel solation (41Janmey P.A. Hvidt S. Kas J. Lerche D. Maggs A. Sackmann E. Schliwa M. Stossel T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32503-32513Google Scholar), and high local concentrations of free profilin could facilitate disassembly of specific actin filament populations. The resulting filament fragments could be capped before complete depolymerization and transported to other sites of filament assembly. Much evidence supports the concept that filament assembly uses annealing reactions between such filament fragments (42Kinosian H.J. Selden L.A. Estes J.E. Gershman L.C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12353-12357Google Scholar, 43Cao L.G. Wang Y.L. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1905-1911Google Scholar). Finally, it should be kept in mind that after specific stimuli, profilin in the living cell could combine with other actin regulatory proteins to uncap not only CapG, but also gelsolin and CapZ. For example, proteins that are polyvalent for profilin, such as VASP, may sufficiently increase the local concentration of profilin to facilitate uncapping. This is a particularly interesting hypothesis, given the “anticapping” function recently assigned to Ena/VASP proteins (44Bear J.E. Svitkina T.M. Krause M. Schafer D.A. Loureiro J.J. Strasser G.A. Maly I.V. Chaga O.Y. Cooper J.A. Borisy G.G. Gertler F.B. Cell. 2002; 109: 509-521Google Scholar). Under the appropriate conditions, uncapping by profilin not only could affect actin disassembly but could also serve to dramatically increase actin filament elongation and allow the generation of directional actin-based propulsive forces."
https://openalex.org/W1963514363,"Mullerian inhibiting substance type II receptor (MISRII) is a member of the transforming growth factor-beta superfamily. Mutations in mullerian inhibiting substance (MIS) or MISRII cause male sexual abnormalities, persistent mullerian duct syndrome, and pseudohermaphroditism. The spatial and temporal regulation of MIS and MISRII is important for its biological action. Male Wnt7a mutant mice do not undergo regression of mullerian ducts. Here we showed that the canonical Wnt signaling pathway regulated MISRII. The promoter MISRII was activated by beta-catenin expression, and this activation was dependent on TCF4-binding sites. The nuclear receptor superfamily member steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1) synergistically activated the MISRII promoter with beta-catenin. APC, a negative regulator of Wnt signaling, decreased SF1-mediated activation of the MISRII promoter in the colon carcinoma cell line SW480. We also showed a direct physical interaction between beta-catenin and SF1 by co-immunoprecipitation. Thus, our findings suggest that MISRII is a developmental target of Wnt7a signaling for mullerian duct regression during sexual differentiation."

The present study reports further characterization of MGAT2, a newly identified intestinal MGAT (Cao, J., Lockwood, J., Burn, P., and Shi, Y. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 13860–13866) for its substrate specificity, requirement for lipid cofactors, optimum pH and Mg2+, and other intrinsic properties. MGAT2 enzyme expressed in COS-7 cells displayed a broad range of substrate specificity toward fatty acyl-CoA derivatives and monoacylglycerols, among which the highest activities were observed with oleoyl-CoA and rac-1-monolauroylglycerol, respectively. MGAT2 appeared to acylate monoacylglycerols containing unsaturated fatty acyls in preference to saturated ones. Lipid cofactors that play roles in signal transduction were shown to modulate MGAT2 activities. In contrast to oleic acid and sphingosine that exhibited inhibitory effects, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidic acid stimulated MGAT2 activities. Using recombinant murine MGAT2 expressed in Escherichia coli, we demonstrated conclusively that MGAT2 also possessed an intrinsic acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) activity, which could provide an alternative pathway for triacylglycerol synthesis in the absence of DGAT. In contrast to the inhibitory effect on MGAT2 activities, nonionic and zwitterionic detergents led to a striking activation of DGAT activity of the human DGAT1 expressed in mammalian cells, which further distinguished the behaviors of the two enzymes.

The dietary fat (mainly triacylglycerols) is digested into fatty acids and sn-2-monacylglycerols and absorbed into enterocytes where fatty acids and sn-2-monoacylglycerols are utilized to sequentially re-synthesize diacylglycerols and triacylglycerols by MGAT and acyl-CoA: diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT), allowing for the lipid to be transported into the circulation system by chylomicron. Therefore, MGAT plays a critical role in intestinal dietary fat absorption. MGAT may also play a role in signaling since its enzymatic product diacylglycerol is an activator of protein kinase C as well as an intermediate in the synthesis of phospholipids (3Ron D.

MGAT may also play an important role in systemic regulation of glycerolipid biosynthesis since its sn-2-monoacylglycerol is a competitive inhibitor of glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (11Polheim D.

Because of its association with the microsomal membranes and its alleged involvement in an enzyme complex, MGAT has been difficult to purify to homogeneity (26Lehner R. Kuksis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13630-13636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Several partial purifications of MGAT from rat intestinal membranes and neonatal liver have been reported previously (17Manganaro F. Kuksis A. Can. J. Biochem.

However, properties on a pure MGAT have never been extensively studied because of the lack of a cloned gene encoding the enzyme.The recent cloning and identification of an intestinal MGAT enzyme, MGAT2 (28Cao J. Lockwood J. Burn P. Shi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13860-13866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), allows us to evaluate the intrinsic characteristics of the enzyme. The mouse MGAT2 is most abundantly expressed in the small intestine (28Cao J. Lockwood J. Burn P. Shi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13860-13866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) where the highest MGAT activity was detected. MGAT2 can catalyze the acylation of each of sn-1-monoacylglycerol, sn-2-monoacylglycerol, and sn-3-monoacylglycerol (28Cao J. Lockwood J. Burn P. Shi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13860-13866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). MGAT2-transfected cells also displayed DGAT activity. However, many biochemical characteristics such as acyl donor and acceptor preference and specificity, pH and magnesium optimum, potential activators and inhibitors, and other intrinsic properties await further investigation. By expression of MGAT2 in mammalian cells as well as in bacterial cells, this study examined these properties of the enzyme, mMGAT2.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Rac-1-octanoylglycerol,rac-1-lauroylglycerol,rac-1-palmitoylglycerol, rac-1-stearoylglycerol, rac-1-oleoylglycerol, rac-1-linoleoylglycerol, rac-1-linolenoylglycerol, 1-O-palmityl-rac-glycerol, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylserine, lysophosphatidic acid, Triton X-100, SDS, CHAPS, rac-glycerol 3-phosphate, sn-glycerol 2-phosphate, 1-O-hexadecyl-rac-glycerol, and fatty acyl-CoAs (malonyl-CoA, n-octanoyl-CoA, lauroyl-CoA, palmitoyl-CoA, stearoyl-CoA, oleoyl-CoA, arachidoyl-CoA, linoleoyl-CoA, and arachidonoyl-CoA) were purchased from Sigma. All of the other monoacylglycerols (sn-2-oleoylglycerol), diacylglycerols (rac-1,2-dioctanoylglycerol, sn-1,3-dioctanoylglycerol, rac-1,2-dilauroylglycerol, sn-1,3-dilauroylglycerol, rac-1,2-dipalmitoylglycerol, sn-1,3-dipalmitoylglycerol, rac-1,2-distearoylglycerol, sn-1,3-distearoylglycerol sn-1,2-dioleoylglycerol, rac-1,2-dioleoylglycerol, sn-1,3-dioleoylglycerol, sn-1,3-dilinoleoylglycerol, and sn-1,3-linolenoylglycerol) and triacylglycerols (1,2,3-triocatanoylglycerol, 1,2,3-trilauroylglycerol, 1,2,3-tripalmitoylglycerol, 1,2,3-trioleoylglycerol, 1,2,3-tristearoylglycerol, 1,2,3-trilinoleoylglycerol, 1,2,3-trilinolenoylglycerol, and 1,2,3-triarachinoylglycerol) used as substrates or standards were obtained from Doosan Serdary Research Laboratories (Toronto, Ontario, Canada). [14C]Oleoyl-CoA (50 mCi/mmol) and sn-2-[3H]monooleoylglycerol (60 Ci/mmol) were from American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc. (St. Louis, MO).Expression of MGAT2 and DGAT1 in Mammalian Cells—A mammalian expression plasmid coding full-length mouse MGAT2 was engineered as described previously (28Cao J. Lockwood J. Burn P. Shi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13860-13866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Similarly, the human DGAT1 coding sequence was amplified from human small intestine cDNA (BD Biosciences and Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) and cloned into NotI and EcoRV sites of the pcDNA3.1/Hygro(–) mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen). COS-7 cells were maintained under the conditions recommended by American Tissue Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and transiently transfected with vectors with or without mouse MGAT2 or human DGAT1 cDNA as described previously (28Cao J. Lockwood J. Burn P. Shi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13860-13866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were harvested in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, pelleted by centrifugation, homogenized, and assayed immediately or frozen in liquid N2 for later use.In Vitro Assays for MGAT and DGAT Activity—Cell pellets were homogenized in 20 mm NaCl with three short 10-s pulses from a Brinkmann Polytron. The resultant homogenates were used to assess the activity of MGAT and DGAT in transfected mammalian cells. The protein concentration in homogenates was determined by a BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce) according to manufacturer's instructions. MGAT and DGAT activity was determined at room temperature in a final volume of 100 or 200 μl as previously described (28Cao J. Lockwood J. Burn P. Shi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13860-13866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). MGAT activity was determined by measuring the incorporation of [14C]oleoyl moiety into diacylglycerol with [14C]oleoyl-CoA (acyl donor) and various monoacylglycerols (acyl acceptors) or by measuring the incorporation of acyl moiety into diacylglycerol with various acyl-CoAs and sn-2-[3H]monooleoylglycerol. The incorporation of [14C]oleoyl moiety into trioleoylglycerol with [14C]oleoyl-CoA and sn-1,2-dioleoylglycerol was measured to obtain DGAT activity. The acyl acceptors were introduced into the reaction mixture by liposomes prepared with phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylserine (molar ratio ≈1:5). Unless indicated otherwise, the reaction mixture contained 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin free fatty acids (Sigma), 200 mm sucrose, 20 μm of various cold acyl-CoAs or [14C]oleoyl-CoA (50 mCi/mmol), 2 μm sn-2-[3H]monooleoylglycerol (60 Ci/mmol) or 200 μm of various cold acyl acceptors, and 50–100 μg of cell homogenate protein or 0.5 μg of partially purified protein from Escherichia coli. The indicated concentration of specific phospholipids, detergents, or other inhibitors and activators was delivered into reactions together with substrates. After a 10–20-min incubation at room temperature, lipids were extracted with chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v). After centrifugation to remove debris, aliquots of the organic phase-containing lipids were dried under a speed vacuum and separated by the Linear-K Preadsorbent TLC plate (Waterman Inc., Clifton, NJ) with hexane:ethyl ether:acetic acid (80: 20:1, v/v/v). The separation was always performed under the conditions where sn-1,2-(2,3)-diacylglycerol and sn-1,3-diacylglycerols were clearly resolved. Individual lipid moieties were identified by standards with exposure to I2 vapor. The TLC plates were exposed to a PhosphorScreen to assess the formation of 14C- or 3H-labeled lipid products. Phosphor-imaging signals were visualized using a Storm 860 (Amersham Biosciences) and quantitated using ImageQuant software.Expression and Purification of mMGAT2 from Escherichia coli— mMGAT2 cDNA was subcloned into an E. coli expression vector for bacterial expression and purification of mouse MGAT2 enzyme. E. coli cell line DH5α was transformed with either empty vector (mock-transformed) or vector containing mMGAT2. Two liters of cultures in LB medium were incubated at 37 °C until A 600 reached 0.7. Expression of recombinant mMGAT2 was then induced by adding 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 16 h at 18 °C. Cells were homogenized by sonication in an extraction buffer containing 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and protease inhibitors. The clarified extract was loaded onto a heparin column (Amersham Biosciences) followed by washing the column sequentially with 40 ml of Tris buffer A (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mm mercaptoethanol, and protease inhibitors) and 50 ml of Tris buffer A containing 2 m NaCl. Bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 150 mm to 1.5 m NaCl. The protein was identified with 12.5% SDS-PAGE gel by Coomassie Blue staining and Western blot analysis.RESULTSSubstrate Specificity of mMGAT2 toward Fatty Acyl-CoA Derivatives and Monoacylglycerols—First, the preference of mMGAT2 toward fatty acyl-CoA derivatives was determined in assays using sn-2-[3H]monooleoylglycerol as acyl acceptor. The experiments were conducted under the conditions where 2 μm sn-2-[3H]monooleoylglycerol was incubated with 20 μm of various fatty acyl-CoA derivatives for 20 min. As shown in Fig. 1, A and B (quantitative analysis of signals in panel A), MGAT2 displayed a broad substrate pattern toward various fatty acyl-CoA derivatives including n-octanoyl-CoA (C8:0), lauroyl-CoA (C12:0), palmitoyl-CoA (C16:0), stearoyl-CoA (C18:0), arachidoyl-CoA (C20:0), oleoyl-CoA (18:1), linoleoyl-CoA (18:2), and arachidonoyl-CoA (20:4). MGAT activity displayed a preference of long chain acyl-CoA derivatives in the range of C8:0–C18:0 but began to decline when arachidoyl-CoA (C20:0) was used as acyl donor. The greatest activity was observed with palmitoyl-CoA (C16:0), stearoyl-CoA (C18:0), and oleoyl-CoA (C18:1). MGAT2 showed dichotomy activities toward unsaturated fatty acids, exhibiting a decreased activity with linoleoyl-CoA (C18:2) compared with C18:0 and C18:1 but a significant enhanced activity with arachidonoyl-CoA (C20:4) compared with C20:0 (Fig. 1, A and B). In accordance with increased MGAT activity, a significant portion of diacylglycerols was converted to triacylglycerols, which are presumably catalyzed by DGAT activity of MGAT2 or the endogenous DGAT activity of COS-7 cells (Fig. 1, A and B). The observed difference in the ratio of triacylglycerol/diacylglycerol between panels A and C of Fig. 1 is probably because of the different ratio of acyl-CoAs and monoacylglycerols in the reaction. More triacylglycerol was formed under the conditions with a high ratio of acyl-CoA, which may be facilitated by excess of acyl-CoA.Second, the substrate specificity of mMGAT2 toward monoacylglycerols containing various fatty acyl chains was determined in assays using [14C]oleoyl-CoA. Because the specific activities of MGAT2 toward either rac-1-monoacylglycerols or sn-2-monoacylglycerols are similar (28Cao J. Lockwood J. Burn P. Shi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13860-13866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), the rac-1-monoacylglycerols were used in the assay. The experiments were performed under the conditions where 50 μm of each monoacylglycerol was incubated with 20 μm [14C]oleoyl-CoA for 20 min. The experiment compared the MGAT activities toward monoacylglycerols containing saturated fatty acids (rac-1-octanoylglycerol (C8:0), rac-1-lauroylglycerol (C12:0), rac-1-palmitoylglycerol (C16:0), and rac-1-stearoylglycerol (C18:0)), unsaturated fatty acids (rac-1-oleoylglycerol (C18:1), rac-1-linoleoylglycerol (C18:2), and rac-1-linolenoylglycerol (C18:3)), and an ether analogue (rac-1-O-palmitylglycerol). In contrast to the preference to acyl-CoAs with longer carbon chain, MGAT2 catalyzed more efficiently the acylation of rac-1-monoacylglycerols containing shorter fatty acyl chains as shown in Fig. 1C and quantitative analysis in Fig. 1D. A much weaker activity was observed with rac-1-monostearoylglycerol, inconsistent with previous observations (28Cao J. Lockwood J. Burn P. Shi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13860-13866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 29Bierbach H. Digestion. 1983; 28: 138-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 30Yen C.L. Farese Jr., R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18532-18537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Furthermore, MGAT2 displayed striking preference toward monoacylglycerols containing unsaturated fatty acids in an order of C18:3>C18:2>C18:1>C18:0. A glycerol ether derivative, rac-1-O-palmitylglycerol can be also utilized as substrates for MGAT2 (Fig. 1C, arrow) although less efficiently than its acyl analogue, rac-1-palmitoylglycerol. In contrast, glycerol 3-phosphate and glycerol 2-phosphate are not substrates for MGAT2 (data not shown). The utilization of any of the acyl substrates in the assays did not exceed 20% of the original amount.pH and Mg2+ Profiles of MGAT2—The pH profile of the MGAT2 was determined using 100 mm Tris buffers between pH 6.0 and 9.0 with an interval of 0.5. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B (quantitative analysis), the optimal activity of MGAT2 was found at pH 7.0 with a broad profile between pH 7 and 9 with more 1,3-diacylglycerol formed at higher pH values. The effect of MgCl2 on the activity of MGAT was also examined in this study because it was reported that the addition of magnesium into the reaction affected MGAT and DGAT activities from various tissues or isolated microsomes (13Jamdar S.C.

The presence of lower concentrations of MgCl2 (<30 mm) showed no significant effects on MGAT2 activity, whereas higher concentrations (>100 mm) of magnesium produced marked inhibition of the reaction (Fig. 2, C and D).Fig. 2Effects of pH values (A and B) and Mg2 + concentrations (C and D) on MGAT activity of MGAT2 expressed in mammalian cells.

Digestion. 1983; 28: 138-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) have been extensively investigated because the presence of detergents is usually necessary to solubilize the enzymes from membranes. However, these experiments were conducted using tissues that may contain several isoforms of each enzyme, making the results difficult to interpret. In this study, we examined the effects of nonionic (Triton X-100), ionic (SDS), or zwitterionic (CHAPS) detergents on MGAT and DGAT activity from MGAT2- and DGAT1-transfected mammalian cells. At a low concentration, none of the detergents posed any measurable effect on DGAT activities. However, Triton X-100, SDS, and CHAPS exhibited severe inhibitory effects on MGAT activity of MGAT2 when the concentration of detergents reached 1.0, 0.1, and 1.0%, respectively (Fig. 3, A and B). The observed DGAT activity from MGAT2-transfected cell homogenate was more liable and sensitive to inactivation by detergents as determined by the formation of triacylglycerol, which started diminishing in the presence of 0.01% Triton X-100, 0.01% SDS, and 0.1% CHAPS, respectively (Fig. 3, A and B). At 0.1% detergent concentration, SDS abolished both MGAT2 and DGAT1 activities and Triton X-100 only diminished the innate DGAT activity of MGAT2 as shown in Fig. 3, A and C, with quantitative analysis shown in Fig. 3, B and D. Surprisingly, at 1.0% concentration, both Triton X-100 and CHAPS significantly enhanced the DGAT activity from DGAT1-transfected cell homogenate. Thus, both Triton X-100 and CHAPS can be used at relatively high concentration (1.0%) to distinguish the MGAT2 activity from that of DGAT1.Fig. 3Effect of detergents on MGAT activity of mouse MGAT2 (A and B) and DGAT activity of human DGAT1 (C and D). The reaction was conducted by incubating 200 μm sn-2-monooleoylglycerol (for MGAT activity of mouse MGAT2) or sn-1,2-dioleoylglycerol (for DGAT activity of human DGAT1) and 25 μm [14C]oleoyl-CoA for 20 min at room temperature with 50 μg of cell homogenate from mouse MGAT2-transfected COS-7 cells in the absence or presence of indicated concentrations of various detergents followed by lipids extraction and TLC assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Radioactivity of diacylglycerols (DAG) or triacylglycerols (TAG) in A and C were quantitated in B and D, respectively.

The addition of phospholipids greatly increased DGAT activity in the lipid body fraction of an oleaginous fungus (32Kamisaka Y. Nakahara T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 520-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In contrast, phosphatidylcholine was shown to inhibit triacylglycerol synthetase activity derived from intestinal mucosa (26Lehner R. Kuksis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13630-13636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Such a discrepancy may be attributed to the presence of different isoforms of MGAT in these studies as reported in small intestine and neonatal liver (20Coleman R.A. Haynes E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 224-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In order to clarify the issue with the MGAT2 enzyme, we characterize the properties of the intestinal MGAT2 using a variety of known inhibitors and activators of MGAT including phospholipids, oleic acid, and sphingosine. Acyl acceptor, sn-2-monooleoylglycerol, in ethanol was delivered into reaction mixture together with the indicated amounts of activators or inhibitors. The amount of ethanol used in the assay was <1%, which did not affect the enzyme activity. phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidic acid activated MGAT activity in a dose-dependent manner as shown in Fig. 4A. The three phospholipids showed similar potency of activation. Lysophosphatidic acid displayed a biphasic effect. Whereas lysophosphatidic acid activated the enzyme activity at relatively lower concentrations, a high concentration of lysophosphatidic acid exhibited a marked inhibitory effect (Fig. 4A). In contrast, oleic acid and sphingosine were potent inhibitors for MGAT2 activity (Fig. 4B).Fig. 4Effect of phospholipids and lysophospholipids (A) and neutral lipids (B) on MGAT activity of mouse MGAT2 expressed in mammalian cells. MGAT activity was measured by incubating 200 μm sn-2-monooleoylglycerol and 25 μm [14C]oleoyl-CoA in the absence or presence of indicated concentrations of lipids, which were delivered to the reaction together with sn-2-monooleoylglycerol.

https://openalex.org/W2105231561,"Most mammals use changing annual day-length cycles to regulate pineal melatonin secretion and thereby drive many physiological rhythms including reproduction, metabolism, immune function, and pelage. Prolonged exposure to short winter day lengths results in refractoriness, a spontaneous reversion to long-day physiological status. Despite its critical role in the timing of seasonal rhythms, refractoriness remains poorly understood. The aim of this study was therefore to describe cellular and molecular mechanisms driving the seasonal secretion of a key hormone, prolactin, in refractory Syrian hamsters. We used recently developed single cell hybridization and reporter assays to show that this process is initiated by timed reactivation of endocrine signaling from the pars tuberalis (PT) region of the pituitary gland, a well-defined melatonin target site, causing renewed activation of prolactin gene expression. This timed signaling is independent of per1 clock gene expression in the suprachiasmatic nuclei and PT and of melatonin secretion, which continue to track day length. Within the PT, there is also a continued short day-like profile of ICER expression, suggesting that the change in hormone secretion is independent of cAMP signaling. Our data thus identify the PT as a key anatomical structure involved in endogenous seasonal timing mechanisms, which breaks from prevailing day length-induced gene expression."

As a model to understand how targeted acetylation may effect transcription, we determined the x-ray crystal structure of the chromatin protein Alba from Archaeoglobus fulgidus, a substrate for the Sir2 protein that deacetylates it at lysine 11 to promote DNA binding by Alba. The structure reveals a dimer of dimers in which the dimer-dimer interface is stabilized by several conserved hydrophobic residues as well as the lysine 11 target of Sir2. We show that, in solution, the mutation of these hydrophobic residues or lysine 11 disrupts dimer-dimer formation and decreases DNA-binding affinity. We propose that the in vivo deacetylation of lysine 11 of archaeal Alba by Sir2 promotes protein oligomerization for optimal DNA binding.

Implications for the mechanism by which histone acetylation modulates gene expression are discussed. The histone protein building blocks that package DNA into chromatin play key roles in gene regulation. An octameric core of histone proteins containing two copies each of histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, together with ∼146 base pairs of DNA wrapped around these proteins, make up a nucleosome particle (1Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6987) Google Scholar). These nucleosome particles form the higher order chromatin structure that is the scaffold from which gene regulation must occur. The histone proteins themselves each contain a globular, highly helical core region that forms the interior of the nucleosome particle and a highly conserved and considerably more flexible N-terminal tail region. The histone tails play a very dynamic role in gene regulation by serving as sites of targeted and extensive post-translation modification, including acetylation, phosphorylation, and methylation (2Grant P.A. Genome Biol. 2001; 2 (Reviews 0003.1-0003.6)Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Marmorstein R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 422-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). These histone modifications also appear to be binding sites for other protein domains (3Marmorstein R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 422-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). It appears that a specific histone modification or constellation of modifications leads to distinct transcriptional events (4Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6678) Google Scholar, 5Turner B.M. Cell. 2002; 111: 285-291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar, 6Shreiber S.L. Bernstein B.E. Cell. 2002; 111: 771-778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), although the mechanism by which this occurs is still poorly understood. Histone H3 methylation at lysine 9 forms one example of how a histone modification can lead to a downstream transcriptional regulatory event. The methylation is carried out, at least in part, by the Su(var)3-9 protein, and the methylated lysine specifically recruits heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) though its chromodomain to silence transcription from heterochromatic DNA (7Nakayama J. Rice J.C. Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Grewal S.I. Science. 2001; 292: 110-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar, 8Bannister A.J. Zegerman P. Partridge J.F. Miska E.A. Thomas J.O. Allshire R.C.

Nature. 2001; 401: 116-120Crossref Scopus (2193) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which other histone modifications, including histone acetylation, modulate transcription is less well understood. Surprisingly, many proteins initially identified as histone acetyltransferases (HATs), such as p300/CBP and PCAF, have also been shown to acetylate non-histone transcription factors, including many transcriptional activators, to promote gene activation (10Sterner D.E. Berger S.L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 435-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (1412) Google Scholar). In addition, histone deacetylases (HDACs) of the Sir2 family have been shown to deacetylate non-histone transcription factors such as the p53 tumor suppressor protein (11Luo J. Nikolaev A.Y. Imai S. Chen D. Su F. Shiloh A. Guarente L. Gu W. Cell. 2001; 107: 137-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1899) Google Scholar, 12Vaziri H. Dessain S.K. Ng Eaton E. Imai S.I. Frye R.A. Pandita T.K. Guarente L. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2001; 107: 149-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2313) Google Scholar). Moreover, a Sir2 homologue from the archaea Sulfolobus solfataricus has been reported to deacetylate a chromatin, non-sequence-specific DNA-binding protein called Alba (formally known as Sso10b) to promote Alba/DNA association and transcriptional repression (13Bell S.D. Botting C.H. Wardleworth B.N. Jackson S.P. White M.F. Science. 2002; 296: 148-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). These additional acetylation and deacetylation substrates provide convenient models for understanding the mechanism of acetylation-dependent modulation of protein activity. For several reasons, the archaeal Alba protein provides a particularly interesting model for understanding how the acetylation status of eukaryotic histones may affect its biological activity. Like the eukaryotic histones, Alba binds DNA nonspecifically, is acetylated in its N-terminal terminus to affect its DNA binding and transcriptional regulatory properties, and also forms higher order structures to bind DNA (14Lurz R. Grote M. Dijk J. Reinhardt R. Dobrinski B. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 3715-3721Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Wardleworth B.N. Russell R.J. Bell S.D. Taylor G.L. White M.F. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4654-4662Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 16White M.F. Bell S.D. Trends Genet. 2002; 18: 621-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Alba homologues are also found in eukaryotes (16White M.F. Bell S.D. Trends Genet. 2002; 18: 621-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), although their greater sequence divergence than that of the archaeal proteins suggests that they may have evolved a new function in eukaryotes. To understand the mechanistic basis for how the acetylation status of Alba may affect its DNA binding properties, we have determined the high resolution crystal structure of Alba from the archaea Archaeoglobus fulgidus (Af-Alba), 1The abbreviations used are: Af-Alba, Alba from Archaeoglobus fulgidus; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; EGS, reagent ethylene glycol bis[succinimidylsuccinate]; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. and have carried out a series of functional studies for correlation with our structural findings. We find that Af-Alba forms a dimeric structure that is similar to the dimeric Alba from the archaea S. solfataricus (15Wardleworth B.N. Russell R.J. Bell S.D. Taylor G.L. White M.F. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4654-4662Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). More interestingly, both crystal forms of Af-Alba characterized in this study show homologous dimer-dimer contacts that involve several conserved hydrophobic residues as well as the lysine 11 substrate for acetylation. Correlating with the importance of this dimer-dimer interface for DNA binding by Af-Alba and acetyl-lysine regulation, cross-linking studies reveal the presence of tetrameric forms of Af-Alba, and mutations of lysine 11 or other hydrophobic residues at the dimer-dimer interface reduce tetramer formation and DNA binding activity by Af-Alba. The implications of these studies for understanding how the acetylation status of eukaryotic histones may affect its biological function are discussed. Protein Expression and Purification—The full-length Alba gene from A. fulgidus (Af-Alba) was PCR amplified from A. fulgidus genomic DNA and cloned into the pGEX4T-1 vector to express the N-terminal glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein. The plasmid was transformed into the Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) strain, grown at 37 °C to an absorbance of 0.5–0.7 at 590 nm, and induced at 30 °C for 3–4 h by adding 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG). For protein purification, a cell pellet from a 3-liter growth culture was suspended and sonicated in a solution containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm PMSF (buffer A). The supernatant was mixed with about 3 ml of glutathione resin for 2 h at 4 °C, packed into a column, and washed with >40-column volume buffer A without PMSF. GST-Alba-bound glutathione resin was removed from the column and treated with thrombin protease at 4 °C for >20 h. The intact Af-Alba protein containing three additional N-terminal residues remaining from the thrombin protease cleavage was released from GST in a buffer containing 20 mm Na-citrate, pH 6.0, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm PMSF (buffer B). The supernatant was recovered by centrifugation, concentrated to about 2 ml using Millipore (Amicon) filtration units, and heat treated at 75–80 °C for 10–20 min to precipitate contaminating proteins. The supernatant was then recovered by centrifugation and chromatographed on a Superdex-75 gel filtration column run with buffer B without PMSF. Peak fractions containing Af-Alba protein eluted in a position close to the 158-kDa globular protein standard, suggesting an oligomeric state and/or elongated shape for the 10-kDa Af-Alba protein. Af-Alba was judged to be >95% pure by SDS-PAGE and concentrated to 20–30 mg/ml for storage at -70 °C. Selenomethionine-derivatized Af-Alba protein was overexpressed from pGEX4T-1/GST-Alba-transformed bacterial strain B834 (DE3) (Novagen) and grown in MOPS-based minimal medium as described elsewhere (17Rojas J.R. Trievel R.C. Zhou J. Mo Y. Li X. Berger S.L. Allis D. Marmorstein R. Nature. 1999; 401: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Substitution mutations in Af-Alba were generated from the pGEX4T-1 plasmid overexpressing GST-Alba with sitedirected mutagenesis (QuikChange, Stratagene) (18Papworth C. Braman J. Wright D.A. Strategies. 1996; 9: 3-4Crossref Google Scholar), and the respective mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Selenomethionine-derivatized and mutant Af-Alba proteins were purified and stored essentially as described for the unmodified protein. Crystallization and Structure Determination—Crystals of native Af-Alba and selenomethionine-derivatized Af-Alba were grown at room temperature using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. Crystals were obtained in two different forms in the space groups P43212 with two molecules per asymmetric unit cell and I212121 with one molecule per asymmetric unit cell. The P43212 crystal form was obtained by mixing 10 mg/ml protein, 1:1 μl, with a reservoir solution containing 15% isopropanol, 50 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 6.0, 100 mm KCl, and 25 mm MgCl2 and equilibrating over 0.5 ml of reservoir solution. The I212121 crystal form was obtained by mixing 6 mg/ml protein, 1:1 μl, with a reservoir solution containing 30% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 400, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, and 200 mm sodium citrate. Both crystal forms grew to a typical size of 100 × 100 × 30 μm over 6 days. The P43212 and I212121 crystal forms were transferred to a reservoir solution supplemented with 15% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (MPD) and 40% polyethylene glycol 400 cryoprotecting reagent, respectively, prior to flash freezing and storage in solid propane prior to data collection. Native data from both crystal forms and a three-wavelength (peak, inflection, and remote) multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) data set from selenomethionine-derivatized P43212 crystals were collected on beamline BM19B at the Advanced Photon Source using an ADSC Quantum-4 CCD detector at 100 K. All data was processed with the HKL-2000 suite (HKL Research Inc.). Data collection statistics are presented in Table I. Four selenium sites were identified in the P43212 crystal form using CNS (19Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S.

Those sites were further refined by CNS and SOLVE. The map was improved by solvent flattening with the program RESOLVE (20Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Refinement was carried out using simulated annealing (22Brunger A.T. Krukowski A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Proteins. 1994; 19: 277-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) refinement protocols in CNS with iterative manual adjustments of the model using the program O with reference to 2F o - F c and F o - F c electron density maps. At 2.65 Å resolution, a bulk solvent correction (24Jiang J.S. Brunger A.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 100-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) was applied to the data, individual atomic B-factors were adjusted, and solvent molecules were modeled into the electron density map. The final model was checked for errors with composite-simulated annealing omit maps (25Brunger A.T. Kuriyan J. Karplus M. Science. 1987; 235: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (2126) Google Scholar). The I212121 crystal form was determined by molecular replacement using the program CNS, with the refined P43212 crystal form as a search model, and refined to a resolution of 2.0 Å essentially as described for the P43212 crystal form. Both structures were refined with excellent residuals and stereochemistry (Table I). The P43212 crystal form was refined to 2.65 Å resolution with an R working and R free of 23.7% and 28.5%, respectively, and the I212121 form was refined to 2.0 Å resolution with an R working and R free of 22.6% and 25.6%, respectively (Table I).Table IData Collection, phasing, and refinement statisticsDataSeMet MAD space groupsNative space groupsP43212P43212P43212P43212I212121Cell parametersa (Å)86.5886.5933.84b (Å)86.5886.5956.03c (Å)81.3381.5690.27Wavelength (Å)0.97930.97950.96860.97950.9795Resolution (Å)30-2.830-2.830-2.820-2.6520-2.0Unique reflection14532145561456491566056Completeness (%)aValues in parentheses are from the highest resolution shell100 (100)100 (100)100 (100)96.6 (97.7)99.9 (100.0)Multiplicity11.311.311.06.88.6I/σ(I) aValues in parentheses are from the highest resolution shell32.6 (11.7)34.4 (13.2)27.8 (8.3)21.8 (6.0)35.6 (13.2)R merge (%)bR merge = Σ|I-〈I〉|/Σ〈I〉8.6 (25.7)8.4 (23.3)10.4 (33.4)8.4 (28.5)5.8 (17.9)Phasing (SOLVE)FOM0.43Z-score20.43Refinement statisticsResolution (Å)20-2.6520-2.0R free (%)cR working = Σ||Fo|-|Fc||/Σ|Fo|0.2850.256R working (%)dR free = ΣT||Fo|-|Fc||/ΣT|Fo| (where T is a test data set of 10% of the total reflections randomly chosen and set aside prior to refinement)0.2370.226Number of atomsProtein6711342Water85164B-factors (Å2)Protein48.227.4Water46.252.9R.m.s.d.Bond length (Å)0.0080.012Bond angle (°)1.31.7a Values in parentheses are from the highest resolution shellb R merge = Σ|I-〈I〉|/Σ〈I〉c R working = Σ||Fo|-|Fc||/Σ|Fo|d R free = ΣT||Fo|-|Fc||/ΣT|Fo| (where T is a test data set of 10% of the total reflections randomly chosen and set aside prior to refinement) Open table in a new tab Cross-linking and Gel Retardation Assays—The reagent ethylene glycol bis[succinimidylsuccinate] (EGS; Pierce) was used for native and mutant Af-Alba cross-linking studies. Different concentrations of EGS were mixed with 20 μg of protein in 10 μl of a solution containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, and 150 mm NaCl and reacted at room temperature for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 0.35 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and an equal volume of SDS-loading dye and analyzed on a 4–20% gradient SDS-PAGE gel. For gel retardation assays with the native and mutant Af-Alba proteins, 250 ng of pRSET plasmid DNA was mixed with different concentrations of protein in a solution containing 20 mm MES, pH 6.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and equilibrated at room temperature for 15 min. The samples were run on 0.7% agarose gels and stained with ethidium bromide for DNA visualization. Overall Structure of A. fulgidus Alba—The Af-Alba protein monomer adopts an elongated shape with dimensions of roughly 23 × 26 × 50 Å with a topology of β1-α1-β2-α2-β3-β4 with each successive secondary structural element running in opposite directions roughly parallel to the long dimension of the molecule (Fig 1a). The β3 and β4 strands are particularly long, extending almost the entire length of the molecule. Both the P43212 and I212121 crystal forms reveal a 2-fold symmetric Af-Alba dimer burying about 1500 Å2 of solvent-excluded surface in which the molecules interact side-by side along the long dimension of the monomer and with the 2-fold axis aligned perpendicular to the long dimension of dimer (Fig. 1b). Residues from the α2 helix and β3 and β4 strands mediate all of the dimer contacts (Fig 2a). Not surprisingly, the dimers in both crystal forms reported here are essentially superimposable, with an r.m.s.d. of 1.3 Å for Cα atoms, and they are also very similar to two different crystal forms of a previously reported Alba dimer from the archaea S. solfataricus (15Wardleworth B.N. Russell R.J. Bell S.D. Taylor G.L. White M.F. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4654-4662Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) with an r.m.s.d. of 3.8 and 3.7 Å for the two crystal forms, respectively. Notably, nearly all of the residues involved in dimer interactions are conserved within the Alba proteins, including the Alba homologues from eukaryotic organisms (Fig. 3), suggesting that this dimer is a conserved feature of these proteins.Fig. 2Oligomerization contacts in Af-Alba. a, the interface of the Alba dimer showing side chains that participate in dimer contacts. b, the dimer-dimer Alba interface is shown highlighting the side chain residues that stabilize the interface with a color-coded van der Waals surface representation.

Interestingly, the high mobility group protein IHF uses a similarly extended β-hairpin to bind DNA (26Rice P.A. Yang S.-W. Mizuuchi K. Nash H.A. Cell. 1996; 87: 1295-1306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar), suggesting that this region of Alba may be used for DNA binding. Higher Order Oligomerization of Af-Alba—Interestingly, both crystal forms of Af-Alba show very similar dimer-dimer contacts in the crystal lattice with an r.m.s.d. of 4.3 Å. for the Cα atoms between both tetramers (Fig. 2, b and d). Like the dimerization interaction, the dimer-dimer interactions are 2-fold symmetric and, in this case, the interface is formed primarily by antiparallel interactions between hydrophobic residues in the α1 helices of one subunit of each of the dimers but also involves the C-terminal tip of the α2 helix. In the P43212 crystal form, the dimer-dimer interface is formed by van der Waals interactions between Met14 and Met55′ (where the prime designates a residue from the opposing subunit), Leu18 and Leu18′-Leu21′, Phe54 and Phe54′, and an H-bond between Asn25 and Asn15′ with a overall solvent-excluded surface of 4,620 Å2 (Fig. 2c). The dimer-dimer interface of the I212121 crystal form is somewhat more intimate, with a solvent-excluded surface of 4,665 Å2. This dimer-dimer interface shows van der Waals interactions between Leu18, Leu18′-Leu21′, and the aliphatic region of Asn25′ and between Phe54 and Phe54′. In addition, this interface shows a direct hydrogen bond between Lys11 (in a loop just N-terminal to the α1 helix) and Glu26′ (Fig. 2b). Strikingly similar dimer interfaces are observed in two different crystal lattices of the Alba structures from S. solfataricus (15Wardleworth B.N. Russell R.J. Bell S.D. Taylor G.L. White M.F. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4654-4662Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), although the dimer-dimer interfaces in these structures are more similar to the P43212 crystal form of Af-Alba (Fig. 2c). Also significantly, most of the residues mediating dimer-dimer contacts in Af-Alba are conserved among the archaeal proteins (Fig. 3). In particular, Phe54, Met14, and Lys11 are strictly conserved, and positions 18 and 21 are invariably hydrophobic. Taken together, these structural features suggested that the dimer-dimer interactions observed in the crystals may be physiologically relevant. Noticeably, the conservation of archaeal residues at the dimer-dimer interface did not extend to the eukaryotic Alba homologues (Fig. 3), suggesting that the eukaryotic proteins may not form similar dimer-dimer contacts. Solution Oligomerization and DNA Binding Properties of Native and Mutant Af-Alba Proteins—To test directly the physiological relevance of the observed dimer-dimer contacts in the crystals, we carried out mutagenesis of residues that were implicated in playing an important role at this interface. We chose to mutate Leu18 and Phe54 because they participated in dimer-dimer contacts in both crystal forms; we also chose to mutate Lys11 because it is the site of deacetylation by the Sir2 protein, and we entertained the possibility that deacetylation of this residue may play a modulatory role in dimer-dimer formation. For residues 18 and 54, we chose mutations that would be predicted to be disruptive to the dimer-dimer interface; therefore, we prepared leucine to arginine (L18R) and phenylalanine to arginine (F54R) substitutions at residues 18 and 54, respectively. For lysine 11, we chose both conservative (arginine, K11R) and non-conservative substitutions for mutagenesis (glutamine, K11Q; and methionine, K11M). Modeling studies suggested that each of these mutations would disrupt the Lys11-Glu26′ hydrogen bond revealed to stabilize the hydrogen bond in the I212121 crystal form. As a control, we also prepared an asparagine to alanine substitution at residue 10 (N10A). Residue 10 was located at the border of the dimerdimer interface; however, it did not appear to play a direct role in dimer formation in either of the two crystal forms of Af-Alba reported here. We therefore expected that the N10A substitution would behave similarly to the native protein in its ability to form dimer-dimer contacts. We prepared proteins containing substitution mutations by site-directed mutagenesis and purified each of the mutants to homogeneity for analysis in vitro. To determine the oligomerization states that Af-Alba and each of the mutants formed in solution, we subjected each of the proteins to cross-linking with increasing concentrations of the cross-linking reagent EGS. As can be seen from Fig. 4a, the native and N10A control proteins form both dimers and tetramers, and, at higher EGS concentrations, the relative proportions of dimer and tetramer are comparable. Each of the Af-Alba mutants at the dimer-dimer interface also show cross-linked dimers and tetramers; but in contrast to the native protein and the N10A mutant, the amount of cross-linked tetramer is significantly reduced relative to the amount of respective dimer for each of the mutants. In addition, the hydrophobic substitution mutants L18R and F18R also form high order oligomers. Together, the cross-linking data demonstrates that the Af-Alba mutants at the dimer-dimer interface form less stable tetramers than the native protein, consistent with the physiological relevance of the Af-Alba tetramer observed in the crystal lattice. A prediction from the cross-linking studies is that dimerdimer Af-Alba contacts play a positive regulatory role in DNA binding by Af-Alba, and, therefore, one would expect that the mutations at the dimer-dimer interface would decrease DNA binding. To test this directly, we assayed the ability of Af-Alba and the mutants to band-shift plasmid DNA in agarose gels. We and others have shown that Alba does not have appreciable affinity for oligonucleotides (Ref. 15Wardleworth B.N. Russell R.J. Bell S.D. Taylor G.L. White M.F. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4654-4662Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar and data not shown). Fig 4b shows that 250 ng of plasmid DNA is visibly shifted at Af-Alba concentrations above 62 ng. At higher concentrations of Af-Alba the plasmid DNA becomes more retarded until it apparently saturates the plasmid DNA at about 250 ng of Alba protein. In contrast, each of the proteins with mutations at the dimer-dimer interface visibly shifts the plasmid DNA at reproducibly higher protein concentrations of roughly 6–8-fold. The N10A mutation, located outside of the dimer-dimer interface and still showing robust tetramer cross-linking activity (Fig. 4a), binds DNA only slightly less well (∼2-fold) than the native protein, suggesting that asparagine 10 of Af-Alba may be involved in direct DNA contact. Taken together with the structural and cross-linking results, these DNA binding studies imply that dimer-dimer formation in Af-Alba plays a stimulatory role on DNA binding by Alba. Moreover, the structural and solution data supports the proposal that lysine 11 of Alba, the target of deacetylation by the Sir2 protein, plays an important role in modulating this activity. We presume that the slight variability of specific dimer-dimer interactions in the various structures (Fig. 2) and the relatively low solvent-excluded surface at the dimer-dimer interface relative to the monomermonomer interface may further facilitate acetylation-dependent regulation of Alba oligomerization for DNA binding. Model for DNA Binding by Alba and Its Regulation by Acetylation—The structural and functional data described above strongly implies that Af-Alba binds DNA as a dimer of dimers. The high conservation of residues at the dimer-dimer interface among other archaeal Alba proteins also implies that all members of the entire family of archaeal Alba proteins share the same feature (Fig. 3). Notably, many of these residues are not conserved within the eukaryotic Alba proteins, suggesting that they do not form similar oligomers for DNA binding (Fig. 3). As noted previously (15Wardleworth B.N. Russell R.J. Bell S.D. Taylor G.L. White M.F. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4654-4662Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), a DALI search using the Alba monomer reveals structural similarity to two other known nucleic acid-binding proteins, translation initiation factor 1 (r.m.s.d. = 2.2 Å) and DNase I (r.m.s.d. = 2.7 Å). The structure of the DNase I in complex with an 8-base pair DNA duplex suggests where Alba may bind DNA. A superposition of the protein from the DNase I/DNA complex with one subunit of the Af-Alba dimer places the DNA on the surface of the protein formed by the β1-α1 and β2-α3 loops as well as the tip of the β3-β4 hairpin (Fig. 5a). This superposition also places the Af-Alba subunit on the minor groove side of the DNA. Consistent with this general mode of DNA binding, this surface of the Alba protein contains the most electropositive charged surface (Fig. 5b), which would nicely complement the electronegative minor groove of the DNA, and the β1-α1 and β2-α3 loops contain two of the most highly conserved sequence patches within the archaeal Alba proteins (Fig. 3). Also consistent with DNA binding in this mode, only a relatively minor reorientation of the DNA helical axis of the model would allow each subunit of the Alba dimer to make symmetric interactions with a B-form DNA duplex (Fig. 5). Taken together, we propose that the Alba dimer binds along the minor groove side of DNA, in contrast to a previous model that places it across the ends of the dimer along the minor groove with the center of the molecule across the DNA major groove (15Wardleworth B.N. Russell R.J. Bell S.D. Taylor G.L. White M.F. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4654-4662Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). How may the Af-Alba tetramer bind DNA? Upon extending our model for DNA binding by the Af-Alba dimer to DNA binding by the Af-Alba tetramer, we find that a sharp DNA bend of about 60° is required to allow each Af-Alba dimer of the tetramer to bind DNA in the same way for each dimer (Fig. 5). This proposal is consistent with the structure of the high mobility group protein IHF bound to DNA, which also binds essentially B-form DNA as a dimer along the minor groove and uses extended antiparallel β-hairpin arms, similar to the extended β3-β4 hairpin arms of the Af-Alba dimer, to sharply bend DNA just outside of the arm regions (26Rice P.A. Yang S.-W. Mizuuchi K. Nash H.A. Cell. 1996; 87: 1295-1306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). The proposal that Alba may bend DNA is also consistent with its presumed biological role in facilitating DNA packaging in Archaea (15Wardleworth B.N. Russell R.J. Bell S.D. Taylor G.L. White M.F. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4654-4662Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) by inducing negative DNA super coiling (27Xue H. Guo R. Wen Y. Liu D. Huang L. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3929-3933Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) without significant DNA compaction (14Lurz R. Grote M. Dijk J. Reinhardt R. Dobrinski B. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 3715-3721Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, this modeling exercise with DNA also places lysine 11, at the edge of the dimer-dimer interface, in position to also interact with DNA directly. This is consistent with the slightly greater mutational sensitivity to DNA binding of Lys11 mutations over the Leu18 and Phe54 mutations (Fig. 4c). Lysine 11 may therefore play a duel role in facilitating dimer-dimer contacts as well as direct protein-DNA contacts to enhance Af-Alba affinity for DNA. The importance of lysine 11 in Af-Alba function is consistent with the important regulatory role of the deacetylation of this residue by the Sir2 protein. It is possible that Af-Alba forms even higher order structures on DNA, as suggested by recent studies showing that S. solfataricus Alba saturates plasmid DNA with a stoichiometry of about 10 bp per protein dimer (15Wardleworth B.N. Russell R.J. Bell S.D. Taylor G.L. White M.F. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4654-4662Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), a stoichiometry that would be higher than that predicted from our model for DNA binding. Without further structural information, it is unclear how this may occur, but it could involve the incorporation of Alba dimers to bridge contacts between two Alba tetramers bound to DNA. Like the archaeal Alba protein, eukaryotic histone proteins are also acetylated to modulate gene expression. In the case of the histone proteins, hyperacetylation is generally correlated with gene activation, whereas hypoacetylation is correlated with repression. The mechanism by which the acetylation status of histones regulates gene expression is still unclear; however, several models have been proposed. In one model, acetylation of lysine residues neutralizes the lysine charge of the lysine residues, thereby loosing the interaction of the histone tails with DNA and thus increasing DNA access for the binding of transcription factors to promote transcriptional activation. A second model argues that the unacetylated histone tails interact with neighboring nucleosomes in chromatin and that acetylation relieves these interactions to destabilize repressive higher order chromatin. A third model argues that histone acetylation is one histone modification among many that establish a “histone code” to mark histone binding sites for other transcriptional regulatory proteins to elicit modification-dependant transcriptional activities (4Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6678) Google Scholar, 5Turner B.M. Cell. 2002; 111: 285-291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar, 6Shreiber S.L. Bernstein B.E. Cell. 2002; 111: 771-778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). There have been several studies that support each of these models, and it is likely that they are not mutually exclusive. The studies we present here suggest that acetylation-induced regulation of archaeal Alba proteins involve the modulation of a higher order Alba structure. This would be consistent with a model in which histone tail acetylation would disrupt higher order chromatin structure. Confirmation of this model would certainly require further direct studies involving histone proteins. Nonetheless, the structural and functional studies presented here suggest that the acetylation status of archaeal Alba effects its oligomerization status, and it is possible that the evolution to eukaryotic systems and histone proteins may have maintained this mechanism of transcriptional regulation.

https://openalex.org/W2043103968,"Surfactant-associated protein D (SP-D) is a collectin that is present in lung surfactant and mucosal surfaces. Although SP-D regulates diverse functions, only a few proteins are known to bind to this collectin. Here we describe the co-purification of decorin, a novel SP-D-binding protein, from amniotic fluid. The human decorin that co-purified with SP-D is a 130–150-kDa proteoglycan, which has a 46-kDa protein core and ∼90-kDa dermatan sulfate chain. Both native and recombinant decorin can bind to SP-D that is already bound to maltose-agarose matrix, and these SP-D-decorin complexes are dissociated at high salt (0.5–1.0 m NaCl) conditions, releasing the decorin. We further show that SP-D and decorin interact with each other (k d = 4 nm) by two mechanisms. First, the direct binding and competition experiments show that the carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) of SP-D binds in a calcium dependent-manner to the sulfated N-acetyl galactosamine moiety of the glycosaminoglycan chain. Second, complement component C1q, a complement protein that is known to interact with decorin core protein via its collagen-like region, partially blocks the interaction between decorin and native SP-D. This protein, however, does not block the interaction between decorin and SP-D(n/CRD), a recombinant fragment that lacks the N-terminal and collagen-like regions. Furthermore, the core protein, obtained by chondroitin ABC lyase treatment of decorin, binds SP-D, but not SP-D(n/CRD). These findings suggest that decorin core protein binds the collagen-like region of the SP-D. Concentrations of decorin and SP-D are negatively correlated to each other, in amniotic fluid, implying a functional relevance for SP-D-decorin interaction, in vivo. Collectively, our results show that carbohydrate recognition domains of SP-D interact with the dermatan sulfate moiety of decorin via lectin activity and that the core protein of decorin binds the collagen-like region of SP-D in vitro, and these interactions may be operative in vivo.

The decorin peptide (38 kDa) is predicted to fold as a C-shaped corkscrew-like molecule where amphipathic α-helices and β-sheet forms convex and concave surfaces, respectively (37Weber I.T.

The core protein has three potential Asn-linked carbohydrate attachment sites, which are predicted to be distributed along one side of the molecule, and a Ser-linked sulfated glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chain near the N terminus (39Seidler D.G.

Therefore, decorin may regulate some of the phenotypes observed in SP-D gene deficiency.In this report, we describe the co-purification of decorin and SP-D from human amniotic fluid. For the first time, we show that SP-D interacts with decorin and that this interaction involves two different types of binding. The globular domain of SP-D binds carbohydrate moieties of decorin, whereas the decorin core protein binds the collagen-like region of SP-D. We also identified that the sulfation of GalNAc is critical for the high affinity interaction between SP-D and this carbohydrate moiety. SP-D and decorin concentrations are inversely related in amniotic fluid samples, and this association may be related to inflammation and/or airway remodeling in vivo.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicals—All of the enzymes and buffer salts were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise stated. Recombinant human decorin expressed in Sf9 insect cells, using the baculovirus system, was purchased and stored at –20 °C in phosphate-buffered saline with bovine serum albumin (R&D Systems, Abingdon, UK). Affinity-purified anti-recombinant decorin monoclonal antibody or polyclonal antibody raised in goat was also purchased from R&D Systems. Dermatan sulfate and high molecular weight heparin were a gift from Dr. Barbara Mulloy (National Institute of Biological Standards and Control, South Mimms, Potters Bar, UK). Chondroitin 4-sulfate and chondroitin 6-sulfate were purchased from Calbiochem.Purification of SP-A, SP-D, and C1q—We purified SP-A from the surfactant pellet that was obtained from therapeutic lung washings of individuals with alveolar proteinosis, by butanol extraction, mannose-agarose affinity, and gel filtration chromatographies, as described previously (29Palaniyar N. Zhang L. Kuzmenko A. Ikegami M. Wan S. Wu H. Korfhagen T.R. Whitsett J.A. McCormack F.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26971-26979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). SP-D was purified from supernatants of lung washings by maltose-agarose affinity, selective manganese elution, and gel filtration chromatography as described previously (13Strong P. Kishore U. Morgan C. Lopez Bernal A. Singh M. Reid K.B. J. Immunol. Methods. 1998; 220: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We purified C1q from human plasma samples (HD Supplies) with minor modifications to the previously published procedure (52Reid K.B. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 16-25Google Scholar). In this procedure, we used DEAE-Sepharose and SP-Sepharose and Superose 6 instead of DEAE-Sephadex A-50, CM-cellulose 32, and Bio-gel A-5 M columns, respectively. Recombinant human SP-D that contain only the neck/CRD was expressed in Pichia pastoris and purified by SP-Sepharose ion exchange, maltose-agarose affinity, and Superose 6 gel filtration chromatographies as described previously (17Hakansson K. Lim N.K. Hoppe H.J. Reid K.B. Struct. Fold Des. 1999; 7: 255-264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (122) Google Scholar).Estimation of the Molecular Mass of Native SP-D—Native SP-D purified from alveolar proteinosis lung washings eluted in the void volume of the Superose 6 gel filtration column as described previously (13Strong P. Kishore U. Morgan C. Lopez Bernal A. Singh M. Reid K.B. J. Immunol. Methods. 1998; 220: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). To estimate the molecular mass of the protein used in this study, we examined the oligomeric state of the negatively stained SP-D by transmission electron microscopy (data not shown). The SP-D appeared as “fuzzy balls,” and on average, consisted of 10.5 ± 4.3 (mean ± S.D., n = 40) trimeric subunits/molecule. Therefore, we considered that the molecular mass of the native SP-D was 1355 kDa (43 × 3 × 10.5). For comparison purposes, calculations were also made with the dodecameric molecular mass of SP-D (516 kDa).Purification of Decorin and SP-D from Amniotic Fluid—Amniotic fluid samples obtained from natural or cesarean births were stored at –70 °C. This study was approved by the Central Oxfordshire Research Ethics Committee, and patients gave informed consent. For a typical purification, 1–2 liters of amniotic fluid was thawed to room temperature, 5 mm EDTA was added, and the fluid was gently stirred for 30 min and then centrifuged at 10000 × g for 90 min at 4 °C. Maltose-agarose (20 ml) matrix and 20 mm CaCl2 were added to the clarified supernatant. The pH was adjusted to 7.4, and the suspension was gently stirred for 1–2 h at 23 °C or 18 h at 4 °C. The SP-D-maltose-agarose and SP-D-binding protein complexes were collected by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 10 min or filtered through a sintered glass filter and packed into a 10 × 1.6-cm column. The complexes were washed extensively with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.02% (w/v) NaN3 buffer. The proteins that interacted with the complexes or matrices were eluted with 1 m NaCl in the wash buffer. The eluate was saved for decorin purification. SP-D was eluted from the column using 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mm MnCl2 and was further purified by gel filtration chromatography in Superose 6 (30 × 1.6 cm; Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (13Strong P. Kishore U. Morgan C. Lopez Bernal A. Singh M. Reid K.B. J. Immunol. Methods. 1998; 220: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The eluate obtained from 1 m NaCl wash was adjusted to 10 mm EDTA and concentrated using a 10-kDa molecular mass cut-off Amicon membrane filter under pressure and gentle stirring or an ultrafree centrifugation filter (Millipore, Watford, UK). The buffer of the concentrated sample was changed to 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA (TSE) and applied to a Superose 6 (30 × 1.6-cm) gel filtration column. Fractions (0.5–1.0 ml) were collected and stored at 4 °C until further analysis.Radioiodination of SP-D and Its Binding to Decorin—A volume of 500 μl of native SP-D (50 μg/ml) in 5 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA buffer was placed in an Iodogen bead (400 ng) precoated Eppendorf tube. An aliquot of 5 μl of Na125I (0.5 mCi; Amersham Biosciences) was added into the tube, mixed, and incubated for 10 min on ice. The reaction mixture was applied to a Sephadex G25 PD-10 desalting column (Amersham Biosciences) that was pre-equilibrated with 1% (w/v) BSA followed by 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA buffer. Protein eluted between 3- and 5-ml volume was pooled and stored at 4 °C. The specific activity of this SP-D preparation was 6.1 × 104 cpm/μg of protein.In SP-D binding experiments, recombinant decorin (0.0–5.0 μg/well) was immobilized in the wells of 98-well plates (NUNC-Maxi-Sorp) in 0.1 m sodium bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.6) at 4 °C for 18 h. The washed wells were blocked with 1–5% (w/v) BSA and incubated with a fixed amount of 125I-SP-D (0.1 μg/ml) in 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.1% (w/v) BSA, 0.02% (v/v) Tween 20 buffer for 3–4 h at 37 °C. The wells were washed with the binding buffer, and the bound 125I-SP-D was recovered after incubating the wells with 100 mm NaOH, 5 mm EDTA, 1% (w/v) SDS buffer for at least 30 min at 23 °C. Radioactivity of 50-μl aliquots were determined by a mini-γ-counter (Mini-Assay 6-20; Mini-Instruments, Essex, UK), and the decorin-specific binding of SP-D was determined by subtracting the counts detected in the BSA-coated blank wells from the decorin-containing wells. To determine the affinity between the SP-D and decorin, 0.5 μg of recombinant decorin was immobilized in each well of a 98-well plate, blocked with BSA. 125I-SP-D (0.0–1.0 μg/ml) diluted in binding buffer was allowed to bind decorin present in these wells. Decorin-specific binding of SP-D was determined as described above.Deglycosylation of Decorin—Native decorin (100 μg) purified from amniotic fluid was digested with 1 unit of chondroitin ABC lyase in 40 mm Tris-HCl, 40 mm sodium acetate, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.36 mm pepstatin buffer (pH 8.0) for 18 h at 37 °C. Decorin from the reactions was repurified on a Superose 6 (30 × 1.6 cm) gel filtration column in TSE buffer.Biotinylation of Carbohydrate Ligands—Yeast mannan (1 mg/ml) was reacted with either 0.5, 1.5, or 4.5 mm NaIO4 in 100 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5) for 30 min on ice, and the reaction was stopped with 15 mm glycerol. The mixture was dialyzed in 100 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5) for 18 h at 4 °C and reacted with 5 mm biotin-LC-hydrazide (Pierce) for 2 h at 23 °C in the same buffer. The mixture was dialyzed for 18 h at 4 °C to remove nonreacted biotin and stored at the same temperature. The GAGs were biotinylated using a modification of the method previously described (53Mahoney D.J. Blundell C.D. Day A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22764-22771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). A volume of 20 μl of 250 mm biotin-LC-hydrazide in Me2SO was added to 1 ml of 6 mg/ml solutions of dermatan sulfate, chondroitin 4-sulfate, or chondroitin 6-sulfate in 100 mm MES (pH 5.5) buffer. Subsequently, 13 μl of 12.5, 25, or 50 mg/ml 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylamino propyl)carbodiimide in 100 mm MES (pH 5.5) was added, and the mixture was rotated at room temperature for 18 h. Samples were then dialyzed extensively against distilled water and stored at 4 °C.Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)—Two types of ELISA were used in this study. In the first type, recombinant or native decorin that was purified from amniotic fluid was immobilized on 98-well plates (NUNC-Maxi-Sorp) in 0.1 m sodium carbonate (pH 9.6) buffer for 18 h at 4 °C. Washed wells were blocked with 2–5% (w/v) BSA and incubated with SP-D in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% (v/v) Tween 20, 2 mm CaCl2, or 1 mm EDTA. After washing the unbound proteins, biotinylated anti-human SP-D(n/CRD) antibody (10 μg/ml) was incubated for 1–2 h. The SP-D-antibody complexes were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin and H2O2-tetramethyl-benzidine-based chromogenic substance according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad). The absorbance (405 or 450 nm) of individual wells was measured by a Spectrophotometer (Multiscan Ascent, Labsystems; Fisher). In the second type of ELISA, native SP-A, SP-D, and C1q or recombinant fragment of human SP-D(n/CRD) was immobilized on plates. To detect the decorin bound to these proteins, we used a polyclonal or monoclonal anti-recombinant human decorin antibody and anti-goat or anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody system or biotinylated anti-decorin primary antibody and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin system (see “Results” and the legends to Figs. 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and 9, 10, 11 for further details on ELISA).Fig. 2SP-D interacts with recombinant human decorin.

CaM can exist in three major structural states: an apo state with no Ca2+ bound, a two Ca2+ state with its C-terminal domain Ca2+-loaded, and a four Ca2+ state in which the lower Ca2+ affinity N-terminal domain is also ligated. Here, the interaction of EF with the three Ca2+ states of CaM has been examined by NMR spectroscopy and changes in the Ca2+ affinity of CaM in the presence of EF have been determined by flow dialysis. Backbone chemical shift perturbations of CaM show that EF interacts weakly with the N-terminal domain of apoCaM. The C-terminal CaM domain only engages in the interaction upon Ca2+ ligation, rendering the overall interaction much tighter. In the presence of EF, the C-terminal domain binds Ca2+ with higher affinity, but loses binding cooperativity, whereas the N-terminal domain exhibits strongly reduced Ca2+ affinity. As judged by chemical shift differences, the N-terminal CaM domain remains bound to EF upon subsequent Ca2+ ligation. This Ca2+ dependence of the EF-CaM interaction differs from that observed for most other CaM targets, which normally interact only with the Ca2+-bound CaM domains and become active following the transition to the four Ca2+ state.

These conformational rearrangements lead to the exposure of a number of hydrophobic residues and render apo- and Ca2+-loaded CaM structurally quite distinct (5Ikura M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 14-17Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar, 6Nelson M.R. Chazin W.J. Biometals. 1998; 11: 297-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Most of the target enzymes of CaM utilize those exposed hydrophobic residues as interaction sites (7Crivici A. Ikura M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1995; 24: 85-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). The CaM-Ca2+ dissociation constants extend over the range of 10–6 to 10–5m under physiological salt concentrations (8Haiech J. Klee C.B. Demaille J.G. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 3890-3894Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 9Linse S. Helmersson A. Forsen S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8050-8054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In resting cells, which contain about 0.05–0.1 μm free Ca2+ (10Tsien R.Y. Pozzan T. Rink T.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1984; 9: 263-266Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 11Tsien R.Y. Pozzan T. Rink T.J. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 94: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar), the apo state of CaM dominates. The release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores, or the gated Ca2+ influx from outside the cells, increases the concentration of free Ca2+ up to 1–2 μm (10Tsien R.Y. Pozzan T. Rink T.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1984; 9: 263-266Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 11Tsien R.Y. Pozzan T. Rink T.J. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 94: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar) and, consequently, increases the proportion of the Ca2+-loaded states of CaM. Most physiological targets regulated by CaM interact only with the Ca2+-bound domains and require the transition of CaM to the four Ca2+ state for activation (12Hoeflich K.P. Ikura M. Cell. 2002; 108: 739-742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). The selective binding and concomitant stabilization of the open domain states of CaM generally results in an increase of the Ca2+ affinity of CaM upon complex formation with its targets (13Huang, C. Y., Chau, V., Chock, P. B., Wang, J. H., and Sharma, R. K. (1981) 78, 871–874Google Scholar). Previous biochemical and structural studies of the EF-CaM interaction have provided insight into the activation of EF by CaM. Both the N- and C-terminal domains of CaM are essential for EF activity; however, only the Ca2+ binding ability of the C-terminal CaM domain is required for EF activity (14Drum C.L. Yan S.Z. Sarac R. Mabuchi Y. Beckingham K. Bohm A. Grabarek Z. Tang W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36334-36340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the 2Ca2+·CaM·EF complex shows that EF interacts with the closed N-terminal domain and the open C-terminal CaM domain in an extended conformation, with no direct contacts between the two domains (15Drum C.L. Yan S.Z. Bard J. Shen Y.Q. Lu D. Soelalman S. Grabarek Z. Bohm A. Tang W.J. Nature. 2002; 415: 396-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Activation of EF arises from the stabilization of a 12-residue-long catalytic loop, which is disordered in the CaM-free state. The present study examines the interaction of EF with the three major Ca2+ states of CaM by NMR spectroscopy, with the aim to investigate whether and how the apo- and 4Ca2+-loaded forms of CaM interact with EF. Changes in Ca2+ affinities of CaM in the presence of EF are also assessed, using flow dialysis. We find that EF interacts weakly but specifically with the N-terminal domain of apoCaM, whereas the C-terminal CaM domain only engages in the interaction upon Ca2+ ligation. Interaction with EF strongly affects the Ca2+ affinity of CaM, with large increases for the C-terminal Ca2+ sites, and a strong decrease for sites in the N-terminal domain. Remarkably, NMR data indicate that CaM retains specific binding affinity for EF at all levels of Ca2+ ligation. Protein Production and NMR Sample Preparation—Xenopus CaM, enriched with 13C,15N or 2H,13C,15N, was produced as described previously (16Ikura M. Marion D. Kay L.E. Shih H. Krinks M. Klee C.B. Bax A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1990; 40: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The expression and purification of anthrax EF (residues 291–800) followed previously published protocols (14Drum C.L. Yan S.Z. Sarac R. Mabuchi Y. Beckingham K. Bohm A. Grabarek Z. Tang W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36334-36340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To strip the divalent cations away from EF, it was washed with a 50 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl solution by three ultrafiltration-dilution cycles (1:10 dilution) and subsequently exchanged into a 50 mm NaCl solution, pH 7.0, by repeated ultrafiltration-dilution. CaM was treated analogously, but as CaM has a stronger affinity for Ca2+, EDTA at pH 9.5 and 1:20 dilutions were used. Nevertheless, the final sample solution in the NMR tube typically contained 100 ± 10 μm Ca2+, as measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Besides an EF-CaM sample with 0.3 mm CaM (ϵ280 = 3005 m–1 cm–1) and 0.5 mm EF (Bradford assay), a CaM-only sample containing 0.2 mm of protein was also prepared to serve as a reference. Ca2+ was titrated into the sample solutions from a stock solution of 20 mm CaCl2, 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.0. With a relatively low CaM concentration of 0.3 mm, the initial Ca2+ presence of 0.1 mm was found to have quite pronounced effects on the spectra. To acquire data below an effective Ca2+ concentration of 0.1 mm, the sample preparation was repeated, but this time EDTA was retained at 7.5 and 50 mm, and after additional buffer exchange, EDTA at 100 mm (without NaCl) was also used. An upper limit for the concentration of free Ca2+ in the presence of EDTA was estimated from the Ca2+ affinity of EDTA at pH 7.0 (17Martell A.E. Smith R.M. Critical Stability Constants. Plenum Press, New York1977Google Scholar). For spectral assignment purposes, a third sample was also prepared, containing 0.5 mm CaM and 0.6 mm EF, in 5 mm CaCl2, 50mm NaCl, pH 7.0. NMR Spectroscopy—Experiments were carried out on Bruker DRX800 and DRX600 spectrometers equipped with a room temperature probe and a cryogenic triple resonance probe, respectively. Data were processed with the NMRPipe package (18Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11638) Google Scholar) and analyzed with NMR-View (19Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2686) Google Scholar). For each Ca2+ titration point, 1H-15N TROSY-HSQC spectra (20Pervushin K.V. Wider G. Wuthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1998; 12: 345-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) were recorded at 800 MHz and 25 °C with acquisition times of 41 ms in the 1H dimension and 51.2 ms in the 15N dimension. Backbone HN, Cα, C′, and N chemical shifts for the Ca2+-saturated state (4Ca2+·CaM·EF) were obtained from TROSY-HNCO and TROSY-HNCA experiments (21Salzmann M. Pervushin K. Wider G. Senn H. Wuthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13585-13590Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar), recorded at 600 MHz and 29 °C. For residues with characteristic HN, Cα, C′, and N chemical shifts, assignments were inferred by comparison with reported shifts in the apo- and Ca2+-loaded CaM states. For a subset of these, sequential 13Cαi-13Cαi–1 connectivities were available to confirm these assignments. Flow Dialysis—Experiments were performed analogously to earlier descriptions (8Haiech J. Klee C.B. Demaille J.G. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 3890-3894Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 22Stemmer P.M. Klee C.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6859-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). In brief, the dialysis cell, comprising an upper and lower compartment built from Teflon, was thermostated at 25 °C. The upper chamber contained 6 μCi of 45CaCl2 and 32 nmol of either CaM alone or of each CaM and EF in 2 ml 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.3, 100 mm KCl solution. CaM and EF were decalcified as described above; however, ensuing buffer exchange was performed by two gel filtration steps. Buffer exchange was complete as judged from the absence of 1H EDTA NMR signals (data not shown). The Ca2+ concentrations of the buffer and sample solutions were determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy and calculated on the basis of the specific activity of 45Ca2+. The lower dialysis cell chamber was perfused at a flow rate of 180 ml/h. Interval times between sample collections were 2.4–2.8 min. Six to seven fractions were collected after each addition of Ca2+ ligand, and 1 ml of each fraction was counted in 10 ml of Aquasol. Data were corrected for ligand depletion (11% of radioactivity added at the start of the experiment) and corrected for the low affinity Ca2+ binding to EF (23Shen Y. Lee Y.S. Soelaiman S. Bergson P. Lu D. Chen A. Beckingham K. Grabarek Z. Mrksich M. Tang W.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6721-6732Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), which was determined independently. Macroscopic Ca2+-CaM·EF dissociation constants, K, were determined by fitting the data to the Adair-Klotz equation (24Edsall J.T. Wyman J. Biophysical Chemistry. 1. Academic Press, New York1958: 591-662Crossref Google Scholar) assuming four Ca2+-binding sites, N=x/K1+2x2/K1K2+3x3/K1K2K3+4x4/K1K2K3K41+x/K1+x2/K1K2+x3/K1K2K3+x4/K1K2K3K4(Eq. 1) where N denotes the moles of bound Ca2+ per mole of CaM, x refers to the concentration of free Ca2+, determined experimentally, and K 1, K 2, K 3, and K 4 are the fitted macroscopic dissociation constants. In the course of a Ca2+ titration of CaM in the absence of EF, first the C-terminal and then the N-terminal CaM domain undergo well characterized structural and dynamic changes (5Ikura M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 14-17Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar, 6Nelson M.R. Chazin W.J. Biometals. 1998; 11: 297-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). For example, NMR resonances whose chemical shift differ between the Ca2+-free and bound states experience extensive broadening as a result of Ca2+ off-rates in the fast to intermediate exchange limit (25Malmendal A. Evenas J. Forsen S. Akke M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 883-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 26Evenas J. Malmendal A. Thulin E. Carlstrom G. Forsen S.

Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 3124-3128Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). When performing a Ca2+ titration of CaM in the presence of EF, spectral changes resulting from the Ca2+ dependence of the CaM-EF interaction superimpose on the effect of Ca2+ binding to CaM. This leads to relatively complex NMR spectra, but also gives some insights into the Ca2+ binding properties of CaM when bound to EF, in addition to the interaction of CaM with EF itself. By isotopically labeling only CaM, but not EF, the H-N backbone resonances of CaM, which are sensitive probes of the structural and dynamic environment of their associated residue, can be selectively examined. By NMR standards the CaM·EF complex of 76 kDa is quite large, but transverse relaxation optimized (TROSY) NMR experiments (28Riek R. Pervushin K. Wuthrich K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 462-468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) made the study of this complex feasible. The Interaction of Edema Factor with Apocalmodulin—In the presence of excess EF, the appearance of the H-N TROSY correlation spectrum of apoCaM is very similar to that of CaM in the absence of EF (Fig. 1). Only a small subset of resonances shift slightly in position and broaden severely, whereas the majority of resonances retain the same chemical shifts, while their 15N line width increases by about 60%. If complex formation between apoCaM and EF would be complete, an increase in the 15N line width by about a factor of five would be expected due to the slower tumbling of the 76-kDa complex compared with free CaM (16 kDa). The observed 60% increase in line width therefore indicates that only about 15% of CaM molecules are bound to EF, corresponding to a dissociation constant, K D, of about 2 mm between apoCaM and EF. A comparison of the broadening of individual resonances, expressed most conveniently as ratios between the signal intensity of free CaM, I 0, and CaM in the presence of EF, I, shows that all strongly broadened resonances belong exclusively to the N-terminal CaM domain (Fig. 2A). In the millimolar affinity range of the interaction between apoCaM and EF, the selective broadening of a subset of resonances is generally caused by exchange kinetics between free and EF-bound CaM that is fast on the NMR chemical shift timescale (>104 s–1). This broadening is then proportional to the square of the chemical shift difference (expressed in frequency units) between the free and bound state. A low signal intensity ratio between the H-N correlations in the presence and absence of EF, I/I 0, therefore correlates with the magnitude of the EF-induced structural perturbation experienced by the HN and 15N nuclei of a particular CaM residue. The obtained intensity ratios, color-coded on the crystal structure of 2Ca2+·CaM·EF, show good agreement with the N-terminal domain-EF contacts, observed in this structure (Fig. 2, B and C). This indicates that apoCaM binds EF through its N-terminal domain in a manner that parallels the interaction observed in the crystal structure of 2Ca2+·CaM·EF, whereas the closed C-terminal domain does not make specific contacts with EF. Ca2 + Affinities of Calmodulin in the Presence of Edema Factor—To separate the effects of Ca2+ binding from those of the CaM-EF interaction, we resorted to flow dialysis experiments, which yield a direct measure for the effect of EF on the Ca2+ affinity of CaM. The Ca2+ titration curve (Fig. 3) reveals an approximately 20-fold increase in affinity for the binding of the first Ca2+ ion in the presence of EF (Table I), but binding of the second Ca2+, which occurs with an ∼2-fold increased affinity, is no longer cooperative (Hill coefficient of ∼1). A likely explanation for this finding is seen in the crystal structure of the 2Ca2+·CaM·EF complex; the distance from Ca2+ at calcium binding site 3 to the carboxyl group of Asp93 of CaM in the EF-CaM complex is 3.1 Å, which is 0.9 Å longer than in free CaM, and is clearly quite unfavorable. This therefore assigns the highest Ca2+ affinity of CaM in the presence of EF to site 4, comprising residues Asn129–Glu140. Interestingly, the Ca2+ affinities of the N-terminal domain binding sites are significantly reduced compared with free CaM (Fig. 3 and Table I), consistent with the observation that no calcium ions were observed in the N-terminal domain of CaM in the structure of EF-CaM complex (15Drum C.L. Yan S.Z. Bard J. Shen Y.Q. Lu D. Soelalman S. Grabarek Z. Bohm A. Tang W.J. Nature. 2002; 415: 396-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar).Table 1Apparent macroscopic dissociation constants, K, for the four Ca2+ binding sites in free CaM and the CaM-EF complexK1K2K3K4μ mμ mμ mμ mCaM·EF0.31.110667CaM5.62.76.548 Open table in a new tab Calmodulin-Edema Factor Interactions in the Two Ca2 + CaM State—Large changes in the NMR spectrum of CaM in the presence of EF are observed upon addition of Ca2+. These changes are illustrated by the behavior of four resonances, comprising two C-terminal domain residues (Thr117 and Lys148) and two N-terminal domain residues (Asp20 and Ala57). For these residues spectral assignment could be maintained throughout the entire Ca2+ titration. In the current section, the effects of going from CaM·EF to 2Ca2+·CaM·EF are discussed, i.e. up to the point where Ca2+ loading of the C-terminal domain of CaM calcium-binding sites is nearly complete, while the calcium binding sites of the CaM N-terminal domain are predominately in the apo state. Ala57 of the N-terminal domain makes no direct contact with EF (Fig. 2A), but its H-N resonance becomes increasingly broadened upon Ca2+ binding by the C-terminal domain (Fig. 4B). In the titration of the C-terminal CaM domain, the chemical shift of Ala57 remains essentially unaltered, i.e. δ(apoCaM·EF) = δ(2Ca2+·CaM·EF), indicating that its resonance broadening is caused by increasingly slower averaged tumbling rates that result from an increase in EF-CaM complex formation. The resonance of Asp20, which is in direct contact with EF and which was severely broadened in the apoCaM state, reappears with higher intensity (Fig. 4A). The exchange broadening of Asp20 has vanished, reflecting a change in CaM-EF exchange kinetics from fast for apoCaM to slow for 2Ca2+·CaM. This indicates a much reduced off-rate (<100 s–1) for 2Ca2+·CaM binding to EF compared with apoCaM. Slow exchange kinetics are also evidenced by the simultaneous presence of both the EF-bound and EF-free resonance of the C-terminal residue, Lys148, during the titration of the C-terminal CaM domain (Fig. 4D). Lys148 is one of the few C-terminal domain residues whose H-N chemical shifts are not affected by Ca2+ binding and therefore monitors exclusively the CaM-EF interaction. In contrast, the vast majority of C-terminal residues, such as Thr117, experience a Ca2+-dependent exchange process that broadens them beyond detection at intermediate Ca2+ levels (Fig. 4C). Only after Ca2+ complex formation progresses toward completion, the resonances reappear at positions that differ from free 2Ca2+·CaM by an additional chemical shift, ΔδEF, resulting from the new EF-bound environment. For the N-terminal domain residues of CaM that interact with EF (Fig. 2A), the apoCaM·EF peak positions are displaced toward the 2Ca2+·CaM·EF resonances by about 10–15% relative to free CaM (data not shown). This agrees well with the estimated 15% fraction of apoCaM·EF complex formation obtained above from the line width increase. Calmodulin-Edema Factor Interactions in the Saturated, Four Ca2 + CaM State—When continuing the Ca2+ titration, Ca2+-induced exchange broadening of the N-terminal domain residues is observed, e.g. Asp20 and Ala57 (Fig. 4, A and B). For the C-terminal domain residues, a slight increase in signal intensities is observed (e.g. Thr117 and Lys148; Fig. 4, C and D), resulting from the completion of Ca2+ saturation of the C-terminal domain binding site 3. Analogous to what was observed above for the N-terminal domain residues upon Ca2+ binding of the C-terminal domain, the chemical shift of the C-terminal domain residues remain essentially unchanged upon Ca2+ ligation of the N-terminal domain, i.e. δ(2Ca2+·CaM·EF) = δ(4Ca2+·CaM·EF) (data not shown; cf. also Fig. 4, C and D). In contrast, the N-terminal domain residues undergo substantial chemical shift changes, ΔδCa2+, in addition to the changes, ΔδEF, seen upon binding of apoCaM to EF. Moreover, comparison of the 4Ca2+·CaM·EF chemical shifts with those of 4Ca2+·CaM indicates that the ΔδEF shift change is not reversed by Ca2+ binding (Fig. 5). Thus, the N-terminal CaM domain remains able to bind Ca2+ and does not dissociate from EF upon Ca2+ binding. As the N-terminal CaM domain initially binds to EF in the closed conformation, the question arises whether Ca2+ binding leads to the “opening” of this domain. In the open state, CaM helices I and II are oriented nearly perpendicular to one another, but opening of the I/II interhelical angle is hindered by the interactions both helices make with EF (Fig. 2, B and C). Helices III and IV do not directly contact EF, but they make hydrophobic contacts with I and II. Unlike for the C-terminal CaM domain, where EF selectively binds the open domain state, resulting in increased Ca2+ affinity, the considerably decreased Ca2+ affinity of the N-terminal domain suggests that EF favors binding the closed N-terminal domain state. The marked differences in H-N chemical shifts between 4Ca2+·CaM·EF and 4Ca2+·CaM for N-terminal domain residues that are not in direct contact with EF (e.g. Ala57, Gly59, and Thr62; Fig. 5) indicate that the structure for the N-terminal Ca2+-ligated domain differs from the open conformation in 4Ca2+·CaM. However, whether an intermediate degree of opening takes place cannot be assessed by the data at hand. In principle, a chemical shift comparison between 4Ca2+·CaM·EF and 4Ca2+·CaM could highlight all sites affected by either EF or the difference in structure, analogous to Fig. 2. Unfortunately, the high molecular weight of the complex (76 kDa) in combination with weak aggregation above about 0.3 mm CaM, as indicated by 15N relaxation data, did not permit the assignment of a sufficiently large number of resonances in the 4Ca2+·CaM·EF state to make such an analysis. In this respect, it is also interesting to note that despite an excess of Ca2+ during crystal growth, only the 2Ca2+·CaM·EF state is observed, with relatively high crystallographic B-factors for the N-terminal domain (15Drum C.L. Yan S.Z. Bard J. Shen Y.Q. Lu D. Soelalman S. Grabarek Z. Bohm A. Tang W.J. Nature. 2002; 415: 396-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). These high temperature factors are indicative of some structural heterogeneity, possibly arising from the presence of a small amount of 4Ca2+·CaM·EF. By comparing CaM 1H-15N NMR resonance intensities in the presence and absence of EF, our data indicate that EF binds the N-terminal domain of apoCaM in a manner that parallels the interaction observed in the crystal structure of 2Ca2+·CaM·EF, i.e. when the Ca2+-bound C-terminal domain is also interacting with EF. The closed C-terminal CaM domain does not participate significantly in the apoCaM·EF interaction, which is estimated to take place with a K D of about 2 mm. With the calcium-free C-terminal CaM domain not binding to EF, we speculate it may sterically interfere with optimal N-terminal CaM domain interaction with EF. Only little catalytic activity of EF at 50 nm or lower Ca2+ concentrations has been reported (23Shen Y. Lee Y.S. Soelaiman S. Bergson P. Lu D. Chen A. Beckingham K. Grabarek Z. Mrksich M. Tang W.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6721-6732Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This agrees well with the picture that EF activation is induced by conformational changes arising mainly from interactions between EF and the C-terminal domain of CaM (15Drum C.L. Yan S.Z. Bard J. Shen Y.Q. Lu D. Soelalman S. Grabarek Z. Bohm A. Tang W.J. Nature. 2002; 415: 396-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), and our observation that the C-terminal domain does not interact with EF in the closed, apo form. Upon titrating Ca2+ into the CaM and EF containing sample, the C-terminal domain engages in the interaction with EF without affecting the N-terminal domain-EF interactions. A detailed picture of this state is provided by the recently reported crystal structure (15Drum C.L. Yan S.Z. Bard J. Shen Y.Q. Lu D. Soelalman S. Grabarek Z. Bohm A. Tang W.J. Nature. 2002; 415: 396-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). EF binding to the open C-terminal domain also leads to the stabilization of this structural state as evidenced by approximately 20- and 2-fold increased Ca2+ affinities for the first and second Ca2+-binding sites, respectively, compared with free CaM. Ca2+ binding to the N-terminal CaM domain proceeds with considerably reduced affinities compared with free CaM, suggesting that EF opposes opening of this domain, which is perhaps not surprising given its well defined contacts with the closed domain. The extent of any N-terminal CaM domain opening upon Ca2+ ligation in the complex poses an interesting question, which could not be answered with the data at hand. However, differences in chemical shifts between the free and EF-bound states indicate that the N-terminal domain maintains contact with EF. Clearly, N-terminal domain Ca2+ ligation is negligible at physiological Ca2+ levels and is not needed for enzymatic activity. This agrees with the findings that mutational inactivation of the N-terminal Ca2+-binding site of CaM has no effect on EF activity (14Drum C.L. Yan S.Z. Sarac R. Mabuchi Y. Beckingham K. Bohm A. Grabarek Z. Tang W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36334-36340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and that the CaM mutant N41C,K75C, locked in the closed conformation by the Cys41-Cys75 disulfide bond, exhibits the same Ca2+ dependence of EF activation as does wild-type CaM (23Shen Y. Lee Y.S. Soelaiman S. Bergson P. Lu D. Chen A. Beckingham K. Grabarek Z. Mrksich M. Tang W.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6721-6732Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Taking together our NMR analysis and the crystal structures of EF alone and in complex with CaM, we propose the model for the EF-CaM interaction depicted in Fig. 6. In this model, EF exists in two structural states: a closed state, termed EFc, represented by the structure of EF alone, and an open state, termed EF°, represented by the structure of EF in the 2Ca2+·CaM·EF complex. In the EFc state, the catalytic core (CA and CB) and helical domains (Fig. 6), which together constitute the adenylyl cyclase domain, form an extensive contact surface of about 3600 Å2. Binding of the C-terminal CaM domain disrupts this contact surface, in contrast to the binding of the N-terminal CaM domain, which takes place at a largely solvent-exposed site of the helical domain. N-terminal domain interactions with EF are therefore an efficient point of initial contact between the two proteins. The binding of N-terminal CaM to the EF helical domain places the C-terminal CaM against the interface of CA and CB. Conceivably, the restricted flexibility of the linker between the N- and C-terminal domains of apoCaM will then facilitate crossing of the energy barrier associated with the dissociation between the catalytic core and helical domains. The extensive interaction surface of about 6000 Å2 between the C-terminal CaM domain and both catalytic core and helical domains will then make up the enthalpic loss from the contact between catalytic core and helical domains. Such a model is consistent with the recent observation that a mixture of the isolated N- and C-terminal CaM domains cannot reconstitute the EF catalytic activity observed for CaM (23Shen Y. Lee Y.S. Soelaiman S. Bergson P. Lu D. Chen A. Beckingham K. Grabarek Z. Mrksich M. Tang W.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6721-6732Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In the presence of EF, our study reveals significantly enhanced Ca2+ affinities of the two C-terminal Ca2+-binding sites of calmodulin, accompanied by a loss in their cooperativity. The N-terminal CaM domain experiences a large reduction of Ca2+ affinities, but gains in cooperativity. However, as Ca2+ binding to the N-terminal domain is not relevant for EF activation, unlike for most other cellular targets of CaM (12Hoeflich K.P. Ikura M. Cell. 2002; 108: 739-742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar), EF appears to be significantly activated before maximum activation is reached for most endogenous cellular CaM targets. Even at free Ca2+ concentrations found in resting cells of 0.05–0.1 μm, in vitro experiments have shown that EF is already significantly activated, but, as observed in vivo as well as in vitro, elevated Ca2+ levels are required for full activation, although eventually a decrease in EF activity is observed (23Shen Y. Lee Y.S. Soelaiman S. Bergson P. Lu D. Chen A. Beckingham K. Grabarek Z. Mrksich M. Tang W.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6721-6732Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 29Kumar P. Ahuja N. Bhatnagar R.

This behavior differs significantly from the related adenylyl cyclase toxin CyaA from Bordetella pertussis, which appears to bind CaM in a Ca2+-independent manner and is highly active even at resting cellular Ca2+ concentrations (23Shen Y.

https://openalex.org/W2055578580,"To establish a system for efficient direct in vivo gene targeting into rat joint, we have evaluated a strategy of gene transfer by means of the delivery of external electric pulses (EP) to the knee after intra-articular injection of a reporter gene (GFP). Rats were killed at various times after the electro gene-therapy to analyze GFP gene expression by immunohistochemistry. GFP staining was detected in the superficial, middle, and deep zones of the patellar cartilage at days 2 and 9, and thereafter only in the deep zone (months 1 and 2). The average percentage of GFP-positive cells was estimated at 30% both one and 2 months after the gene transfer. Moreover, no pathologic change caused by the EP was detected in the cartilage. The level and stability of the long-term GFP expression found in this study demonstrate the feasibility of a treatment of joint disorders (inflammatory or degenerative, focal or diffuse) using electric gene transfer."
https://openalex.org/W2163003023,"Thiomandelic acid is a simple, broad spectrum, and reasonably potent inhibitor of metallo-β-lactamases, enzymes that mediate resistance to β-lactam antibiotics. We report studies by NMR and perturbed angular correlation (PAC) spectroscopy of the mode of binding of the R and S enantiomers of thiomandelic acid, focusing on their interaction with the two metal ions in cadmium-substituted Bacillus cereus metallo-β-lactamase. The 113Cd resonances are specifically assigned to the metals in the two individual sites on the protein by using 113Cd-edited 1H NMR spectra. Each enantiomer of thiomandelate produces large downfield shifts of both 113Cd resonances and changes in the PAC spectra, which indicate that they bind such that the thiol of the inhibitor bridges between the two metals. For R-thiomandelate, this is unambiguously confirmed by the observation of scalar coupling between Hα of the inhibitor and both cadmium ions. The NMR and PAC spectra reveal that the two chiral forms of the inhibitor differ in the details of their coordination geometry. The complex with R-thiomandelate, but not that with the S-enantiomer, shows evidence in the PAC spectra of a dynamic process in the nanosecond time regime, the possible nature of which is discussed. The thiomandelate complex of the mononuclear enzyme can be detected only at low metal to enzyme stoichiometry; the relative populations of mononuclear and binuclear enzyme as a function of cadmium concentration provide clear evidence for positive cooperativity in metal ion binding in the presence of the inhibitor, in contrast to the negative cooperativity observed in the free enzyme.

Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 385-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The β-lactamases that contain a nucleophilic serine side chain as a key component of their active site (classes A, C, and D) have been extensively studied due to their established clinical importance. The class B β-lactamases or metallo-β-lactamases (MBLs) 1The abbreviations used are: MBL, metallo-β-lactamase; BBL, class B β-lactamase; MES, 4-morpholinoethanesulfonic acid; NQI, nuclear quadrupole interaction; AOM, angular overlap model. are metalloproteins that require one or two zinc ion(s) for their activity (2Wang Z.

The first of these enzymes to be discovered was produced by an innocuous strain of Bacillus cereus (3Kuwabara S. Abraham E.P. Biochem. J. 1967; 103: 27C-30CCrossref PubMed Google Scholar), but in the last 20 years, MBL-mediated resistance has appeared in several pathogenic strains and is being rapidly spread by horizontal transfer, involving both plasmid- and integron-borne genetic elements (4Laraki N.

The zinc ligands are not fully conserved between the different subclasses of MBL. In the subclass B1 enzymes, such as the B. cereus enzyme BcII, which is the subject of the present work, the zinc in site 1 is coordinated by the imidazole rings of three histidine residues (86, 88, and 149 in the B. cereus enzyme or 116, 118, and 196 using the class B β-lactamase (BBL) numbering (17Galleni M.

In site 2, the metal is coordinated by a histidine (210, BBL263), an aspartic acid (90, BBL120), a cysteine (168, BBL221), and one or two solvent molecules.

In a structure of BcII containing two zinc ions determined at pH 7.5, a similar bridging solvent molecule is seen (15Paul-Soto R. Zeppezauer M. Adolph H.W. Galleni M. Frere J.-M. Carfi A. Dideberg O.

The coordination of the metal ions is thus quite variable, perhaps contributing to some of the observed differences in substrate profiles and zinc affinities among MBLs (18Orellano E.G.

The bridging hydroxide ion or water molecule has been proposed to be the nucleophile responsible for β-lactam hydrolysis, but the precise role of the two metals in catalysis remains unclear; mechanisms have been proposed in which only site I plays a direct role in catalysis (21Bounaga S. Laws A.P. Galleni M. Page M.I. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 703-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) or in which the two zinc ions are both involved as a binuclear center (2Wang Z. Fast W.

Nandwani, and G. C. K. Roberts, unpublished data. Inhibitors of the class A serine β-lactamases, such as clavulanic acid, have been very widely used to protect penicillins from β-lactamase-mediated hydrolysis. However, since MBLs are resistant to all clinically used serine β-lactamase inactivators, the search for a clinically useful inhibitor of MBLs remains an important objective. We have recently reported (23Mollard C. Moali C. Papamicael C. Damblon C. Vessilier S. Amicosante G. Schofield C.J. Galleni M. Frere J.M. Roberts G.C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45015-45023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) that thiomandelic acid (α-mercaptophenylacetic acid) is a broad spectrum and reasonably potent inhibitor of MBLs. Structure-activity relationships show that the thiol is essential for activity, and it was postulated that the inhibitor thiol binds to the zinc ions. We now report direct studies of the interaction of thiomandelate with the active site metals in cadmium-substituted B. cereus MBL. In the majority of MBLs, zinc can be exchanged with cadmium to yield catalytically active enzymes (15Paul-Soto R. Zeppezauer M. Adolph H.W. Galleni M. Frere J.-M. Carfi A. Dideberg O. Wouter J. Hemmingsen L. Bauer R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16500-16506Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and in the case of CcrA the structure of the cadmium-substituted enzyme has been shown to be essentially identical to that of the zinc enzyme (13Concha N.O. Rasmussen B.A. Bush K. Herzberg O. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 2671-2676Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Isotopes of cadmium provide very convenient probes for NMR and PAC spectroscopy, allowing direct studies of the coordination and dynamics of the metal ion. We have reported the use of a combination of NMR and PAC spectroscopy to study cadmium binding to B. cereus MBL, revealing rapid intramolecular exchange of the metal between the two sites in the monocadmium enzyme and negative cooperativity in metal binding (24Hemmingsen L.

We have now used a similar combination of 1H, 15N, and 113Cd NMR and 111mCd PAC spectroscopy to study the interaction of the R and S forms of thiomandelate with the metal ions in cadmium-substituted B. cereus MBL. Materials— 15N-Labeled protein was expressed from plasmid pET/BCII in E. coli BL21(DE3). Cells were grown at 30 °C in M9 minimal medium with 4 g of glucose and 1 g of 15NH4Cl as the only nitrogen source. Expression was induced by adding 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-thiogalactoside when the culture had an absorbance at 600 nm of 1.25. After 16 h, the cells were harvested by centrifugation and broken by sonication, and the β-lactamase was purified as described elsewhere (6Carfi A. Pares S. Duee E. Galleni M. Duez C. Frere J.M.

R- and S-thiomandelic acid were synthesized as described earlier (23Mollard C. Moali C. Papamicael C. Damblon C. Vessilier S. Amicosante G. Schofield C.J. Galleni M. Frere J.M. Roberts G.C.K. J.

NMR Spectroscopy—For the NMR studies, the cadmium enzyme was prepared at room temperature, by adding gradually a small volume (1–10 μl) of 0.1 m113CdCl2 (95.83% enriched) to the β-lactamase apoenzyme (0.8–1.8 mm) in 10 mm MES-Na, 100 mm NaCl, pH 6.4, 5% 2H2O to give [cadmium]/[enzyme] ratios of 1.0–2.0. Samples of the inhibitor complexes were prepared by the addition of microliter volumes of stock inhibitor solution (50 mm in 0.5 m MES buffer, 100 mm NaCl, pH 6.4) to the enzyme solution. The final sample volume was 450 μl, and the temperature during acquisition was 298 K. The same enzyme preparation and similar sample preparation procedures were used in PAC spectroscopy (see below). All NMR experiments were performed on Bruker Avance DRX/DMX instruments. 1H spectra were obtained at 600 MHz by using a waterflip-back pulse combined with Watergate (26Piotto M. Sudiek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3527) Google Scholar, 27Kuboniwa H. Grzesiek S. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 871-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Backbone NH resonances were observed by 1H,15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) with States-TPPI and Watergate. Observation of imidazole 15N(C)H resonances was by 1H,15N HMQC (heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence) with a refocusing delay of 16.7 ms (1/2J N(C)H), as described previously (25Damblon C. Prosperi C. Lian L.Y. Barsukov I. Paul-Soto R. Galleni M. Frère J.M. Roberts G.C.K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 11575-11576Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The same pulse sequence was used for 1H,113Cd HMQC with 10, 16.7, or 33.3 ms (1/2J Cd-H) as refocusing delay. Selective decoupling experiments were performed using G3 Gaussian cascade shaped pulses within an MLEV sequence (28McCoy M.A. Mueller L. J. Magn. Reson. A. 1992; 101: 122-130Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). All 113Cd experiments were performed at 133 MHz. The external reference was Cd(ClO4)2. For the direct detection of 113Cd, 100,000 free induction decays were recorded, acquiring 4096 complex points in 51 ms, with a 30° observe pulse (4 μs), a spectral width of 80,000 Hz (600 ppm), and a relaxation delay of 0.5 s. A 200-Hz exponential multiplication was used prior to Fourier transformation, followed by base-line correction. PAC Spectroscopy—The necessary amounts of the nuclear probe 111mCd (49-min half-life) were produced by a 24-MeV α particle bombardment of 98.9% enriched metallic 108Pd (Oak Ridge National Laboratory). The radiochemical separation of the target and the purification of 111mCd have been described previously (29Hemmingsen L. Bauer R. Bjerrum M.L. Zeppezauer M. Adolph H.W. Formicka G. Cedergren-Zeppezauer E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 546-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The resulting carrier-free solution (50 μl) was split in two with volume ratios of 1:4, allowing two consecutive PAC counting sessions with equal statistics to be performed from one 111mCd production batch. The tracer solution for each experiment was subsequently adjusted to the desired cadmium concentration by the addition of small volumes of CdCl2 solution in metal-depleted MES buffer. The added amounts of cadmium (0.25–190 nmol) were large compared with both the 111mCd content and other contaminating metals in the solution, even at the lowest concentrations used ([Cd]/[enzyme] = 0.01). Control experiments indicated that any zinc contamination was <0.005 molar equivalent. The apoenzyme was added, giving a final enzyme concentration of 0.5 mm in the PAC samples. The pH was adjusted to pH 7.0 (room temperature) by the addition of small amounts of 1–5 m HCl or NaOH. The final sample conditions were 50 mm HEPES, 130 mm NaCl, with volumes ranging from 50 to 200 μl. After a 10-min waiting period at room temperature, to ensure equilibrium for metal binding to the enzyme, pure crystalline sucrose (ACS reagent from Sigma) was added to give a 55% (w/w) solution in order to slow the rotational diffusion of the enzyme. The PAC sample preparation (tracer and metal addition, incubation, pH adjustment, and sucrose addition) was done immediately before each measurement, allowing a direct transfer of the sample to the temperature-controlled environment of the PAC sample holder. Unless otherwise noted, PAC experiments were performed at 1 °C. The differential time PAC spectrometer (30Bauer R. Danielsen E. Hemmingsen L. Sorensen M.V. Ulstrup J. Friis E.P. Auld D.S. Bjerrum M.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11514-11524Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) uses six 2″ BaF2 scintillation detectors located in a face-centered cube around the sample to absorb the 151 + 245-keV γ-cascade of the 111mCd decay. The FWHM time resolution of the instrument is 1.0 ns, the single detector count rate is ∼60 kcps, and the total data acquisition lasts 100–200 min, giving 50–100 million recorded coincidences. PAC Data Analysis—The perturbation function, G 2(t), of the angular correlation pattern is derived from the measurements as described previously (29Hemmingsen L. Bauer R. Bjerrum M.L. Zeppezauer M. Adolph H.W. Formicka G. Cedergren-Zeppezauer E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 546-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 30Bauer R. Danielsen E. Hemmingsen L. Sorensen M.V. Ulstrup J.

This function depends on the local electric quadrupole interaction at the site of the cadmium nucleus and contains the structural information about the co-ordination geometry that can be deduced from a PAC experiment. In the case of identical, static, and randomly oriented molecules, the perturbation function denoted G 2(t) can be expressed as follows, G2(t)=a0+a1cos(ω1t)+a2cos(ω2t)+a3cos(ω3t)(Eq. 1) where ω1, ω2, and ω3 represent the three difference frequencies proportional to the energy difference between the three sublevels of the spin 5/2 intermediate state of the cadmium nucleus (32Bauer R. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1985; 18: 1-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Note that ω1 + ω2 = ω3. The perturbation function was Fourier transformed as described in Bauer et al. (30Bauer R. Danielsen E. Hemmingsen L. Sorensen M.V. Ulstrup J. Friis E.P. Auld D.S. Bjerrum M.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11514-11524Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The Fourier transform of G 2(t) exhibits three frequencies for each type of environment in the enzyme, giving rise to a nuclear quadrupole interaction (NQI). Each NQI can theoretically be described by the parameters ω0 and η. The relation between the two parameters ω0 and η and the frequencies and amplitudes in the expression for G 2(t) can be found in Bauer (32Bauer R. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1985; 18: 1-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Thus, ω0 and η, which are related to the coordination geometry of the cadmium ion, can be determined from the time dependence of G 2(t). In the liquid state, the NQI in itself is time-dependent because of the Brownian motion of the protein, giving an exponential damping of the observed correlation pattern with a time constant equal to the rotational diffusion time τR. Additional time-dependent variation in the local NQIs can be induced by, for example, an exchange process between two coordination geometries. A distribution of coordination geometries is allowed for by introducing a Gaussian frequency spread δ = Δω0/ω0. The perturbation function A 2 G 2(t), where A 2 is the amplitude, was analyzed by a conventional nonlinear least-squares fitting routine, giving the frequency ω0, the asymmetry η, the relative Gaussian frequency distribution δ, and the rotational diffusion time τR for each of the observed NQIs. In all cases where more than a single NQI is observed, the perturbation function is assumed to be the sum of the individual perturbation functions weighted by a population factor (30Bauer R. Danielsen E. Hemmingsen L. Sorensen M.V. Ulstrup J. Friis E.P. Auld D.S. Bjerrum M.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11514-11524Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). However, the fitting procedure will not always succeed in giving all five parameters for each of several NQIs in a given spectrum. Additional constraints are added to assist the fitting in these cases. In the case of experiments with S-thiomandelate, it was possible (judged by acceptable values for the reduced χ2 function) to fit the spectra obtained at different [cadmium]/ [enzyme] ratios simultaneously. This global fit gave four distinct NQIs, each having individual ω0 and η values, but with identical values of τR and δ. Each S-thiomandelate measurement is assumed to contain these four NQIs with different amplitudes (possibly zero). The spectrum obtained at [cadmium]/[enzyme] = 1.9 must necessarily arise primarily from the binuclear enzyme, since no free cadmium is observed, with both sites almost equally populated, and it was thus fitted under the constraint of equal amplitude, and the amplitudes of the mononuclear NQIs were fixed to zero. The goodness of the fit was judged by the overall χ2 value. The fitting procedure was more complicated in the case of the spectra obtained in the presence of R-thiomandelate, where distinct dynamical features in the 1 °C spectrum prohibit an overall fit of all stoichiometries. The spectra of R-thiomandelate-inhibited samples at –20 °C and +30 °C were fitted assuming four NQIs, two of which are found and fitted at 30 °C and three at –20 °C. The temperature difference introduces differences in τR, and this parameter was not constrained in the fitting process. We assumed the same value of δ as found in the S-thiomandelate experiments in these fits. Molecular Modeling—The starting point for the modeling was the crystal structure of the B. cereus enzyme containing two zinc atoms (8Carfi A. Duée E. Galleni M. Frère J.M. Dideberg O. Acta Crystallogr. 1998; D54: 313-323Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank accession number 1bvt) with hydrogens added using the AMBER package (33Cornell W.D. Cieplak P. Bayly C.I. Gould I.R.

The ligands R- and S-thiomandelate were built using AMBER, and the geometry optimization and charges determination were conducted using Divcon. Docking was carried with AutoDock (36Morris G.M.

A large population size of 200 was used to ensure that conformational space was exhaustively searched; the maximum number of energy evaluations was set to 0.5 million (in tests, using 1 or 3 million did not improve the results), the number of trials was 200, the number of generations was 0.04 million, and all other parameters were set according to the defaults in the AutoDock manual (36Morris G.M.

https://openalex.org/W2025810301,"Tubulin modifies G-protein signaling and heterotrimeric G-proteins regulate microtubule assembly. Here we report an interplay among G-protein-coupled receptor and receptor tyrosine kinase (such as nerve growth factor-NGF) signaling systems in PC12 pheochromocytoma cells that resulted in a translocation of Galpha(s), Galpha(i1), and Galpha(o) from cell bodies to cellular processes where they appear to localize with tubulin-containing structures. This relocation appeared to depend on the integrity of microtubules, as it was blocked and reversed by nocodazole. Latrunculin, which promotes actin filament depolymerization, had no effect. Both deconvolution microscopy and immunoprecipitation showed a significant increase of Galpha association with microtubules that was coincident with the extension of ""neurites."" There were distinctions among the Galpha subtypes, with Galpha(s) showing the most profound NGF-induced colocalization with tubulin. Translocation of Galpha was blocked by agents that inhibit the MAP kinases required for neuronal differentiation, suggesting that G-protein relocation is triggered by the intracellular signals for differentiation. Consistent with this, Galpha in Neuro-2A cells, which spontaneously differentiate, showed a similar translocation coincident with differentiation. Thus, diverse signals that promote neuronal differentiation and changes in cell morphology may use specific G-proteins to evoke cytoskeletal rearrangement."

Studies of bcl-3-deficient mice demonstrated a critical role for bcl-3 in the development of a normal immune response and the formation of germinal centers in secondary lymphoid organs. However, the molecular mechanism that underlies B cell leukemogenesis and the knockout mouse phenotype remains unclear. Here we have identified and characterized BCL-3-binding protein (B3BP) as a protein interacting specifically with the bcl-3 gene product (BCL-3) by a yeast two-hybrid screen. We found that B3BP associates with not only BCL-3 but also p300/CBP histone acetyltransferases. The N-terminal region of B3BP that contains the ATP-binding site is important for the interaction with BCL-3 and p300/CBP. Homology searches indicate that the ATP-binding region of B3BP, which contains a typical Walker-type ATP-binding P-loop, most resembles that of 2′,3′-cyclic nucleotide 3′-phosphodiesterase of mammals and polynucleotide kinase of T4 bacteriophage. In fact B3BP shows intrinsic ATP binding and hydrolyzing activity. Furthermore, we demonstrated that B3BP is a 5′-polynucleotide kinase. We also found a small MutS-related domain, which is thought to be involved in the DNA repair or recombination reaction, in the C-terminal region of B3BP, and it shows nicking endonuclease activity. These observations might help to gain new insights into the function of BCL-3 and p300/CBP, especially the coupling of transcription with repair or recombination.

Therefore, its involvement in the pathogenesis of chronic B cell lymphocytic leukemia has been strongly suggested (1Ohno H. Takimoto G. McKeithan T.W. Cell. 1990; 60: 991-997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). It was also reported that bcl-3 gene expression is induced by many cell growth- or survival-promoting factors in lymphocytic cell lines (2Rebollo A. Dumoutier L. Renauld J.C. Zaballos A. Ayllon V.

Subsequent studies showing a correlation of bcl-3 induction with mouse skin carcinogenesis (5Budunova I.V. Perez P. Vaden V.R. Spiegelman V.S. Slaga T.J. Jorcano J.L.

In fact, ectopic expression of bcl-3 blocked interleukin-4 deprivation-induced apoptosis of a T cell line in vitro and also increased the survival rate of activated T cells in vivo (2Rebollo A.

Transgenic mice in which bcl-3 is expressed under the control of an Ig heavy chain enhancer showed an expansion of the B cell population (10Ong S.T. Hackbarth M.L. Degenstein L.C. Baunoch D.A. Anastasi J. McKeithan T.W. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2333-2343Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, there is no experimental evidence of a role for bcl-3 in cell transformation. Extensive biochemical study has revealed some of the molecular functions of bcl-3. First, amino acid sequence alignment showed that BCL-3 contains seven repeats of an ankyrin-like unit and belongs to the IκB family of proteins, which modulate the DNA binding activity and subcellular localization of the transcription factor NF-κB (11Nolan G.P. Baltimore D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1992; 2: 211-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Subsequently, it was demonstrated that BCL-3 physically associates with the p50 and p50B homodimers of NFKB1 and NFKB2, respectively, and confers transcriptional activation to the otherwise inert complex; hence it functions as a transcriptional co-activator (12Fujita T. Nolan G.P. Liou H.C. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1354-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 13Bours V. Franzoso G. Azarenko V. Park S. Kanno T. Brown K. Siebenlist U. Cell. 1993; 72: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that BCL-3 induces the nuclear translocation of the p50 homodimer generated via reorganization from cytoplasmic p50/p105 (14Watanabe N. Iwamura T. Shinoda T. Fujita T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3609-3620Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). This BCL-3-induced p50 homodimer formation has been observed in vivo; that is, ectopic expression of BCL-3 in thymocytes induced the formation of the p50 homodimer (15Caamano J.H. Perez P. Lira S.A. Bravo R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1342-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and stimulation of cultured T cells with interleukin-9 leads to the induction of BCL-3 expression, which is followed by p50 homodimer generation (3Richard M. Louahed J. Demoulin J.B. Renauld J.C. Blood. 1999; 93: 4318-4327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, p50 homodimer has been implicated in cell survival or the inhibition of apoptosis (3Richard M. Louahed J. Demoulin J.B. Renauld J.C.

Recently, it has also been demonstrated that a putative BCL-3 ortholog of Caenorhabditis elegans interacts with MRT-2 cell cycle checkpoint protein and indeed is involved in the DNA damage response by protein-protein interaction screening combined with a large scale phenotypic analysis (20Boulton S.J. Gartner A. Reboul J. Vaglio P. Dyson N. Hill D.E. Vidal M. Science. 2002; 295: 127-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Above all, knockout mouse studies gave rise to important information on the biological role of BCL-3 (21Schwarz E.M. Krimpenfort P. Berns A. Verma I.M.

The BCL-3-deficient mouse was susceptible to certain kinds of pathogens. Antigen-specific antibody production was severely impaired because germinal center formation in secondary lymphoid organs was markedly inhibited. Such a phenotype was at least to some extent similar to that of NFKB1 and NFKB2 knockout mice (23Paxian S. Merkle H. Riemann M. Wilda M. Adler G. Hameister H. Liptay S. Pfeffer K. Schmid R.M.

Immunol. 1999; 163: 6581-6588PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting physiological significance of the interaction of BCL-3 with these proteins. During the development of germinal centers, B cell-specific genetic recombination of the Ig gene, class switch recombination, and somatic hypermutation proceed to produce a large amount of Ig that has a much higher affinity for the antigen. One hypothesis is that BCL-3 directly regulates class switch recombination and somatic hypermutation because these genetic alterations have a close correlation with the transcriptional activation of the Ig gene itself and the intronic switch region (27Honjo T. Kinoshita K. Muramatsu M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 165-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 28Martin A. Scharff M.D. Nat. Rev.

It was shown that B3BP also interacts with histone acetyltransferase p300/CBP and that the ATP-binding site of B3BP is important for the association with BCL-3 or p300/CBP. Biochemical analysis revealed that B3BP has polynucleotide kinase activity to transfer a phosphate group to the 5′ end of DNA and RNA substrates.

Sci. 1999; 24: 298-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that B3BP plays a role connecting transcriptional activation and genetic recombination of the Ig gene. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—A fragment of mouse BCL-3 cDNA encoding amino acids 16–440 cloned into the LexA DNA-binding domain vector pBTM116 and a human spleen cDNA library cloned into the GAL4 activation domain vector pGAD10 (Clontech) were sequentially used to transform L40 yeast cells according to the protocol described on the Yeast Transformation Home Page ( www.umanitoba.ca/faculties/medicine/units/biochem/gietz/Trafo.html ). Transformants were plated on selection medium (lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine) containing 10 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole. After incubation for 7 days at 25 °C, the clones that allowed growth were identified and confirmed to express β-galactosidase. The plasmids were recovered according to Matchmaker protocols (Clontech) and retransformed into yeast cells containing either pBTM116-BCL-3 or pBTM116 empty vector. cDNA inserts from plasmids that allowed the yeast cells containing pBTM116-BCL-3 to grow on selection medium were identified and further characterized by DNA sequencing. cDNA Cloning and Plasmid Construction—To obtain a full-length B3BP cDNA, a human T cell cDNA library carried in λZAP Express (Stratagene) was screened under stringent conditions using the cDNA of a ∼4.7-kb insert isolated in the two-hybrid screen as a probe. The cDNA inserts from positive phage clones were excised in vivo to generate subclones in the pBK-CMV phagemid and confirmed by sequencing. The ORF containing full-length B3BP cDNA was assembled on a mammalian expression vector, pEF-BOS (32Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1489) Google Scholar). To express GST fusion proteins in Escherichia coli JM109, DNA fragments encoding amino acids 2–631, 1171–1770, 394–630, and 1688–1770 of B3BP were cloned into pGEX-4T (Amersham Biosciences) to construct pGEX-B3BP(N), pGEX-B3BP(C), pGEX-B3BP(M), and pGEX-B3BP(Smr), respectively. A cDNA encoding full-length mouse BCL-3 was cloned into pGEX-4T to express GST-BCL-3 fusion protein. cDNA fragments encoding B3BP, BCL-3, BCL-3 derivatives, and NFKB1 were subcloned into pCS2+ (33Rupp R.A. Snider L. Weintraub H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1311-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar) to transcribe and translate in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (TnT SP6 Quick System; Promega). HA-tagged expression vectors were constructed by inserting the DNA fragment encoding MGYPYDVPDYASLGG for pEF-HA-B3BP and pEF-HA-BCL-3 in the N-terminal end of B3BP and BCL-3, respectively. HA-tagged p300 and FLAG-tagged CBP constructs were described previously (34Suhara W. Yoneyama M. Kitabayashi I. Fujita T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22304-22313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). FLAG-tagged constructs were obtained by inserting the DNA fragment encoding GPGDYKDDDKGDYKDDDK for pEF-B3BP-FLAG and pEF-BCL-3-FLAG in the C-terminal end of B3BP and BCL-3, respectively. To construct expression vectors encoding B3BP derivatives, B3BP(K/A) and B3BP(K/R), site-directed mutagenesis of the Lys453 residue within the ATP-binding site of B3BP was conducted using QuikChange™ (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The authenticity of the substitutions and the absence of any undesired mutations were confirmed by sequence analysis. Antibodies—The monoclonal antibodies against the HA epitope (12CA5; Roche Applied Science), FLAG epitope (M2; Sigma-Aldrich), and p300/CBP (mixed monoclonal antibodies; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) were obtained commercially. The monoclonal antibody against NFKB1 was described previously (35Yoneyama M. Suhara W. Fukuhara Y. Fukuda M. Nishida E. Fujita T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). Recombinant Proteins and in Vitro Binding Assay—All of the pGEX-based bacterial expression vectors were transformed into E. coli strain JM109, and GST fusion proteins were expressed and purified using glutathione-Sepharose resin according to the manufacturer's directions (Amersham Biosciences). For the in vitro biochemical analysis, GST, GST-B3BP(M), and GST-B3BP(Smr) were eluted from the column with buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 20 mm glutathione) and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline. Subsequently, GST-B3BP(Smr) was treated with thrombin protease, and the Smr domain was further purified by ion-exchange chromatography on a Mono S column (Amersham Biosciences). For the GST-based interaction assay, GST fusion proteins attached to glutathione matrix beads were incubated with rabbit reticulocyte lysate containing 35S-radiolabeled protein in Nonidet P-40 binding buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and 10% (v/v) glycerol) for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were subsequently washed five times with Nonidet P-40 binding buffer, and the bound proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography or Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) staining. Reticulocyte lysate used in Fig. 5B was ATP-depleted by passing through the Sephadex G-50 (Amersham Biosciences) column. Cell Culture, DNA Transfection, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blotting—293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and transfected by the calcium phosphate method. 48 h after transfection, 293T cells (∼2 × 106 cells/6-cm dish) were harvested, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and suspended in 400 μl of the extraction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 100 μg of leupeptin/ml, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 10 mm benzamidine). Subsequently, the suspensions were allowed to stand on ice for 30 min and clarified by centrifugation (356,000 × g, 10 min), and the resulting supernatant was subjected to immunoblot analysis and immunoprecipitation. For the FLAG-based interaction assay, typically 100 μl of cell lysate prepared as described above was incubated with 10 μl of anti-FLAG M2-agarose (Sigma-Aldrich) in the extraction buffer for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed five times with the extraction buffer, resuspended in 1× Laemmli's sample buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon; Millipore Corp.) and incubated with anti-HA (12CA5) and anti-FLAG (M2) monoclonal antibodies. Subsequently they were visualized with appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase and an ECL+plus Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Assay for ATP Binding and Hydrolyzing Activity—B3BP-FLAG and its derivatives were expressed in 293T cells and purified using anti-FLAG M2-agarose resin as described above. For the ATP binding assay, proteins attached to the beads were suspended in buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20) and subjected to UV irradiation in the presence of α-32P-labeled 8-azidoadenosine-5′-triphosphate (8-azido-ATP). After the washing out of the uncross-linked 8-azido-ATP, the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography or CBB staining. For the ATP hydrolyzing assay, the proteins were cross-linked with γ-32P-labeled 8-azido-ATP and incubated in the presence or absence of 10 μg of yeast transfer RNA/ml for 60 min at 30 °C in the buffer described above. After a wash, the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, visualized by autoradiography, and quantified using a Bio Image Analyzer BAS-2500 (FUJIFILM). The amount of protein subjected to the assay was confirmed by CBB staining. Assay for Polynucleotide Kinase Activity—Recombinant proteins, GST and GST-B3BP(M), or FLAG-tagged B3BP and its derivatives expressed in 293T cells and absorbed onto anti-FLAG resin were incubated in buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, and 5 mm MgCl2) at 37 °C for 1 h in the presence of γ-32P-labeled ATP with the following substrates: single-stranded DNA, 3′OH-GGAATTCAGAATGTTTTAGCCCTCCATGGGCTGCATGTGG-5′OH; double-stranded DNA, 40 bp annealed with 3′OH-GGAATTCAGAATGTTTTAGCCCTCCATGGGCTGCATGTGG-5′OH and 3′OH-GCTTCATCCACATGCAGCCCAGCGAGGTCTAAAACATTCTG-5′OH, yeast transfer RNA (Roche Applied Science). The samples were separated on a denaturing 10% polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography. The proteins subjected to the assay were run on a NuPAGE 4–12% Bis-Tris gel with SDS-containing MES buffer (Invitrogen) and visualized by CBB staining. Assay for Nicking Endonuclease Activity—Recombinant proteins were incubated in buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 μg of bovine serum albumin/ml) at 37 °C for 2 h with a supercoiled circular DNA (pEF-BOS) as a substrate. The samples were separated on 1% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. The proteins subjected to the assay were run on a NuPAGE 4–12% Bis-Tris gel with SDS-containing MES buffer (Invitrogen) and visualized by CBB staining. Identification of B3BP as a Protein Interacting with BCL-3— We sought to identify proteins other than NFKB1 and NFKB2 that interact specifically with BCL-3. We set up a yeast two-hybrid system with full-length BCL-3 as bait and screened a GAL4 activation domain-tagged cDNA library derived from the human spleen. Although full-length BCL-3 activates transcription substantially in yeast when tethered to DNA via the LexA DNA-binding domain, a competitive inhibitor of His3p, 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole, completely abrogated its intrinsic activity, and screening worked properly under these conditions. From a screen of ∼6 × 106 colonies, 38 clones grew on the selective medium and showed β-galactosidase activity. One clone had a 4.7-kb insert, and a protein of corresponding molecular mass (∼200 kDa) was detected by anti-GAL4 activation domain antibody in the yeast lysate (data not shown). Subsequent sequence analysis revealed that it contains a large in-frame ORF, and a data base search indicated that a portion of its cDNA has been registered as KIAA1413 with unknown function. We obtained full-length cDNA by screening a human T cell cDNA library using the 4.7-kb insert as a probe. The largest clone was isolated and sequenced. It contained a 6626-bp cDNA insert and extended 132 bp 5′ of a Kozak consensus sequence for the predicted start of translation. The predicted polypeptide specified by the ORF comprised 1770 amino acids, which was calculated to be ∼200 kDa. Recently, a 374-amino acid fragment near the C-terminal region of this predicted polypeptide was identified by yeast two-hybrid screening and reported as N4BP2 (Nedd4 ubiquitin ligase-binding partner 2) (36Murillas R. Simms K.S. Hatakeyama S. Weissman A.M. Kuehn M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2897-2907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and its full-length protein was referred to as flN4BP2. It was demonstrated that the corresponding region specifically associates with Nedd4 in vitro and in vivo and was ubiquitinated by Nedd4 in vitro. There has been no biochemical characterization of flN4BP2 so far; therefore we refer to it as BCL-3-binding protein in this paper. Salient features of B3BP include a consensus nucleotide-binding site, the Walker A motif, at residues 447–454, GLPGSGKS. Homology searches using the BLAST algorithm indicate that the nucleotide binding motif and its neighboring sequence most resemble those of 2′,3′-cyclic nucleotide 3′-phosphodiesterase (CNP) of mammals and polynucleotide kinase (PNK) of bacteriophage T4 (PNK domain; Fig. 1, A and B), both of which possess 5′-polynucleotide kinase activity. The other motif shown by the analysis is the Smr domain found in the C-terminal region of B3BP (Fig. 1, A and C). The Smr domain has been described as a highly conserved sequence in the C-terminal region of the bacterial MutS2 family and phylogenetically speculated to be involved in DNA mismatch repair and meiotic chromosome crossing-over (30Malik H.S. Henikoff S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 414-418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 31Moreira D. Philippe H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 298-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We also isolated a mouse homolog of B3BP cDNA that encodes a protein ∼70% identical to the human protein (data not shown). Notably, the N- and C-terminal regions of 300 amino acids containing the PNK and Smr domains, respectively, are more than 88% identical, suggesting functional conservation of these domains. Furthermore, in a survey of the Drosophila melanogaster genome data base, we found a putative ORF, LD21293, that encodes a polypeptide containing both the PNK and Smr domains at its N and C termini, respectively. However, the region between these domains exhibits no significant similarity. There is no ORF that encodes a single polypeptide containing these domains in the C. elegans or Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome, although stand-alone ORFs that encode the Smr domain are found in many lineages of eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomes (30Malik H.S. Henikoff S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 414-418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 31Moreira D. Philippe H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 298-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). B3BP Interacts with BCL-3 in Vitro—The interaction between B3BP and BCL-3 was confirmed in vitro. GST fusion proteins containing the N-terminal (amino acids 2–631; GST-B3BP(N)) or C-terminal (amino acids 1171–1770; GST-B3BP(C)) regions of B3BP were expressed in E. coli and affinity-purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads. These proteins were then incubated with 35S-labeled BCL-3 translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysate. After extensive washing, the bound proteins were separated on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 2A, BCL-3 bound to the N-terminal portion but not the C-terminal portion of B3BP (lanes 5 and 6). In a converse experiment, GST-BCL-3 fusion protein bound to full-length B3BP (lane 7). The coprecipitation of BCL-3 and GST-BCL-3 is due to homophilic interaction (37Wulczyn F.G. Naumann M. Scheidereit C. Nature. 1992; 358: 597-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 38Michel F. Soler-Lopez M. Petosa C. Cramer P. Siebenlist U. Muller C.W. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6180-6190Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We used luciferase, which is unrelated to BCL-3 or B3BP, as a negative control and found that it bound neither to GST nor to GST fusion proteins. It has been shown that the ankyrin repeat domain of BCL-3 is important for the interaction of the homodimer of the NFKB1 p50 subunit (38Michel F. Soler-Lopez M. Petosa C. Cramer P. Siebenlist U. Muller C.W. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6180-6190Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Therefore, we next examined the involvement of the ankyrin repeat domain in the association with B3BP (Fig. 2B). Wild type BCL-3 and the C-terminal deletion mutant, BCL-3(ΔC), which lacks the C-terminal portion (amino acids 353–437) but retains the entire ankyrin repeat domain, specifically associated with GST-B3BP(N) (lanes 5–8). However, another mutant BCL-3(Δank), which lacks a part of the ankyrin repeat (amino acids 260–339) did not bind to GST-B3BP(N) (lanes 9 and 10), indicating the importance of the ankyrin repeat domain. BCL-3(Δank) failed to interact with the NFKB1 p50 subunit as well (data not shown). Although the ankyrin repeat domains of BCL-3 and NFKB1 and NFKB2 are homologous, no significant association was detected between NFKB1 and GST-B3BP(N) (lanes 11 and 12).

We have previously observed an alteration in the stoichiometry of NF subunit steady state mRNA levels in ALS spinal motor neurons using in situ hybridization and proposed that this led to aggregate formation. We have now examined the levels of NF mRNA in whole tissue homogenates of spinal cord using the RNase protection assay and real time reverse transcriptase-PCR and observed significant elevations of NF mRNA level in ALS. Compared with age-matched control, we observed a greater stability of heterogeneously expressed NFL mRNA in the presence of ALS spinal cord homogenates. Heat denaturing or protease K digestion of the control homogenates increased the stability of the NFL mRNA to levels observed in ALS homogenate. Increased NFL mRNA stability was also induced by increasing the percentage of ALS homogenate in an admixture of control and ALS homogenates. These observations suggest the presence of trans-acting NFL mRNA-destabilizing elements in control but not in ALS spinal cord homogenates. This was confirmed in gel retardation assays. We also observed that the destabilizing elements interact with the 3′-untranslated region of NFL mRNA. These findings suggest that the trans-acting NFL-destabilizing elements are selectively suppressed in ALS homogenates, resulting in an increased stability and level of NFL mRNA.

With death ensuing from respiratory failure within 5 years of symptom onset for the majority of patients, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) 1The abbreviations used are: ALS, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; NF, neurofilament; NFL, low molecular weight neurofilament; NFM, middle molecular weight neurofilament; NFH, high molecular weight neurofilament; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; NFL-1000, the last 1000 bp of NFL cDNA; RT, reverse transcriptase; nt, nucleotides; UTR, untranslated region. is among the most devastating of the adult onset neurodegenerative disorders. ALS (also known as Lou Gehrig's disease), characterized by degeneration of motor neurons in the spinal cord, brainstem, and cortex, manifests as a relentlessly progressive loss of strength and function of virtually all skeletal muscles. Of concern, the prevalence is increasing at a rate greater than can be accounted for by increases in longevity of the population (1Lilienfeld D.E. Ehland J. Landrigan P.J. Marsh G. Perl D.P.

Equally unfortunately, there are no therapies available that will significantly truncate the disease progression. Intraneuronal aggregates of neurofilament (NF) in degenerating motor neurons are a key neuropathological hallmark of ALS (3Carpenter S.

Although the exact origin of the NF aggregates remains to be determined, transgenic mouse models in which the overexpression of any of the low molecular weight NF (NFL), middle molecular weight NF (NFM) or high molecular weight NF (NFH) proteins is induced provokes a motor neuronopathy characterized by the presence of abnormal NF accumulations resembling those found in ALS (10Cote F.

Cell. 1993; 73: 23-33Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Remarkably, the motor neuronopathy in transgenic mice overexpressing human NFH subunits was rescued by the co-expression of a human NFL transgene at levels that restored a correct stoichiometry of NFL to NFH subunits (14Meier J. Couillard-Després S. Julien J.-P. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1999; 58: 1099-1110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously observed significant suppressions in NFL mRNA steady state levels in cervical spinal motor neurons in ALS with in situ hybridization (15Wong N.K. He B.P. Strong M.J. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2000; 59: 972-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) Further, we observed a failure of either α-internexin or peripherin mRNA levels to increase to compensate for this suppression of NFL mRNA levels, suggesting an absolute alteration of the stoichiometry of NF expression in ALS. These findings extended the observations of Bergeron et al. (16Bergeron C. Beric-Maskarel K. Muntasser S. Weyer L. Somerville M.J. Percy M.E. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1994; 53: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) of reduced NFL mRNA levels in inclusion-bearing spinal motor neurons in ALS. Using single cell PCR, Menzies et al. (17Menzies F.M. Grierson A.J. Cookson M.R. Heath P.R. Tomkins J. Figlewicz D.A. Ince P.G. Shaw P.J. J. Neurochem. 2002; 82: 1118-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) have confirmed the observation of spinal motor neuron selective alterations in NF expression. Within brainstem nuclei, Hartmann and Sun observed a suppression of NFM mRNA, although only gross visualization of grain density was undertaken, and the remaining intermediate filaments were not assessed (18Hartmann H.A. Sun D.Y. Mol. Chem. Neuropathol. 1992; 17: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations have suggested a significant alteration in NF expression in ALS. Given the selective vulnerability of motor neurons to the degenerative process of ALS and the observations that NF protein expression will be critical to maintaining the structure of these large motor neurons, it has been proposed that such alterations in NF homeostasis could be of direct relevance to the pathogenesis of ALS (19Williamson T.L. Bruijn L.I. Zhu Q. Anderson K.L. Anderson S.D. Julien J.P. Cleveland D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9631-9636Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In this study, we have examined the regulation of NF mRNA stability in ALS and specifically observed that trans-acting NFL mRNA-destabilizing elements normally expressed in control spinal cord are absent in ALS spinal cord homogenates. Tissues—Archival spinal cord tissues of sporadic ALS and age-matched control cases were selected. All ALS cases were clinically and neuropathologically definite ALS (20World Federation of Neurology Research Group on Neuromuscular DiseaseJ. Neurol. Sci. 1994; 124: 96-107PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA Isolation, Reverse Transcription—Total RNA was isolated using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), followed by DNase digestion to eliminate genomic DNA contamination. RNA integrity was assessed with an AGILENT 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany) using a RNA Nano LabChip (Agilent Technologies). RNAs were quantified with spectrophotometer A 260 readings. Synthesis of cDNA was performed using 1 μg of total RNA in a 20-μl system, 25 °C for 10 min, followed by 30 min at 48 °C, and then 5 min at 95 °C. Probes for RNase Protection Assays—[33P]UTP-labeled antisense cRNA probes for human NFL (100 nt; 48 nt from exon 3 and 52 nt from exon 4), NFM (150 nt; 42 nt from exon 2 and 108 nt from exon 3), and NFH (200 nt; 101 nt from exon 3 and 99 nt from exon 4) were synthesized by in vitro transcription from RT-PCR amplicons, with T7 promotor incorporated within reverse primer. Primers for the transcription templates are listed in Table I.

Open table in a new tab RNase Protection Assay—10 μg of total RNA was combined with 4 × 104 cpm of gel-purified NF probe and 2 × 104 cpm of GAPDH probe. The samples were incubated at 42 °C overnight and then subjected to RNase digestion for 45 min at 37 °C using RNase A/T1 mix (RPAII kit; Ambion). Protected fragments were separated on 5% acrylamide, 6 m urea gels. Primers for SYBR Green Real Time Quantitative RT-PCR—Primer sequences were designed using Primer Express Software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and are presented in Table I. SYBR Green Real Time Quantitative RT-PCR—Quantitative PCR was performed on an ABI 7900 PCR Instrument (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in a 20-μl volume, using 2× Universal SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Absolute quantitation assay was adopted. For absolute standard curves, gene fragments that contained fragments to be amplified in real time RT-PCR were ligated into pcDNA3.1(+) vectors and quantified with the A 260 spectrophotometer readings. GAPDH and neomycin-resistant gene from heterogeneous expression vector were used as endogenous references for tissue samples and in vitro incubation samples, respectively, to ensure the same amount of tissue and the same amount of RNA input in the in vitro incubation assays. Each sample was tested in triplicate, and samples obtained from at least three independent experiments were used to calculate the means and S.D. Protein Homogenates Preparation—Protein was extracted from 500 mg of snap-frozen lumbar ventral spinal cord of ALS patients and normal controls. Tissues were homogenized in 2 ml of buffer (25 mm Tris, 0.1 m sucrose, 0.5 mm EDTA plus protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)) using a Brinkman Polytron PT3000 homogenizer and centrifuged twice (5000 × g, 10 min). The supernatant was collected and stored at –80 °C until use. Generation of NFL-1000 mRNA and NFL-CDS mRNA—Because the full-length NFL mRNA is too long for cloning and heterogeneous expression, the last 1000 bp of NFL cDNA (NFL-1000), which contains the putative stability regulatory elements (21Cañete-Soler R. Schwartz M.L. Hua Y. Schlaepfer W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12655-12661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), was RT-PCR-amplified from an ALS patient RNA isolate and cloned into BamHI/NotI sites of pcDNA3.1(+) vector as the representative for the full-length NFL for in vitro stability regulation study. We also engineered NFL cDNA devoid of the 3′-UTR (NFL-CDS) to study the function of 3′-UTR in the stability of NFL mRNA. NSC34 cells (22Cashman N.R. Durham H.D. Blusztajn J.K. Oda K. Tabira T. Shaw I.T. Dahrouge S. Antel J.P. Dev. Dyn. 1992; 194: 209-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar) were chosen because of their high transfection efficiency using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) and were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose, with pyruvate, with l-glutamine) containing 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin solution (23Cookson M.R. Ince P.G. Shaw P.J. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 501-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Transfection was carried out using LipofectAMINE. Cells were maintained for 24 h, and then RNA was extracted using RNeasy minicolumns (Qiagen). On-column DNase digestion was performed to ensure the absence of DNA contamination from the plasmid DNA. Determination of trans-Acting NFL mRNA-destabilizing Elements— The RNA preparation from transfected NSC34 cells containing heterogeneously expressed NFL mRNA was mixed with protein homogenates of 10 mg of lumbar ventral spinal cord from ALS or normal control and incubated at 37 °C for intervals of 0, 60, 120, and 200 min. At each time interval, an aliquot was removed. RNA were then isolated from each aliquot for real time RT-PCR to determine whether the stability of NFL mRNA was modulated by a protein contained within the homogenates derived from control or ALS patients. The same procedure will be repeated with the homogenates that were either boiled for 3 min or treated with protease K (Invitrogen; at concentrations of 0, 25, 50, or 100 μg/ml, at 37 °C for 5 min, and the digest stopped with 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma)). To determine whether a direct interaction occurred between the NFL mRNA and components of the spinal cord homogenates, a gel retardation assay was performed. Protein homogenates (2 μg) were preincubated with 0.125 mg of heparin/ml (Sigma), in binding buffer containing 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 25 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 3.8% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 0.02 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm GTP, and 1.5 mm ATP at 30 °C for 10 min. 33P-Labeled probes (10,000 cpm) were added and incubated at 30 °C for 10 min. Samples were then loaded on a 4% polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresed at 100 V in 1× TBE buffer. The gel was dried and exposed to phosphor image screen for overnight. Determination of the Importance of 3′-UTR to the Stability Regulation of NFL mRNA—Heterogeneously expressed NFL-1000 or NFL-CDS mRNA was mixed with homogenates derived from control or ALS patients, incubated in vitro for 2 h, followed by RNA re-extraction and real time RT-PCR. The stability difference of NFL-CDS in control and ALS homogenates was compared with that of NFL-1000 mRNA. Statistical Methods—All experiments were performed in triplicate, and the significance among different groups was determined by using a grouped Student's t test (Microsoft Excel). Steady State mRNA Level of NFs in ALS Lumbar Ventral Spinal Cord Were Higher than Those in Normal Controls— RNA was extracted from the ventral lumbar spinal cord of ALS patients (n = 6) and normal controls (n = 6) with the removal of genomic DNA contamination with DNase I treatment. RNA integrity was assessed, and only those samples without extensive smearing and having 28 S/18 S rRNA ratios of at least 1:1 were subjected to further analysis. Four ALS and three control samples met these criteria. Using the RNase protection assay (Fig. 1A), all three NF subunits mRNA levels were elevated in ALS relative to normal controls. This observation was confirmed using quantitative real time RT-PCR measurements (Fig. 1B). A 2-fold increase of steady state NFL and NFH mRNA levels and a 1.5-fold increase in NFM mRNA level were observed (p < 0.05). Elevated levels of mRNA may result from either an enhanced rate of gene transcription or from the stabilization of the mRNA. In order to assess mRNA stability, we utilized an in vitro incubation assay in which heterogeneously expressed NFL mRNA was incubated with protein homogenates of either ALS or control lumbar ventral spinal cord. Because cis-acting NFL mRNA-destabilizing elements have been identified for murine NFL (21Cañete-Soler R. Schwartz M.L. Hua Y. Schlaepfer W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12655-12661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 24Cañete-Soler R. Schwartz M.L. Hua Y. Schlaepfer W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12651-12654Google Scholar), we focused on NFL mRNA stability regulation in the following studies. In order to get efficient heterogeneous expression, the NFL-1000 was used as the applicable representative for the full length of NFL mRNA and heterogeneously expressed from pcDNA3.1(+) vectors in transfected NSC34 cells. Total RNAs were extracted from cells after 24 h of transfection. Protein homogenates were prepared from the identical weight of ventral lumbar spinal cord of ALS patients and normal controls. 1 μl of RNA containing NFL-1000 was mixed with 50 μl of tissue homogenates of 10 mg of ALS or control tissue and incubated at 37 °C for intervals of time to 200 min. At each interval (0, 60, 120, 200 min), residual RNAs were re-extracted from the incubated mixture, and NFL-1000 mRNA levels were measured by real time RT-PCR. By using the T7 promotor sequence on the pcDNA3.1(+) vector as one of the real time PCR primers, the endogenous NFL mRNA from the spinal cord or NSC-34 cells was not recognized, thus allowing a true measure of the variation in NFL-1000 mRNA level due to alterations in its stability. NFL-1000 mRNA was found to be more stable in ALS protein homogenates than in control homogenates (Fig. 2). In order to study the determinants underlying the differential stability of NFL-1000 mRNA in ALS and control homogenates, protein homogenates were boiled for 3 min before incubation with NFL-1000 mRNA at 37 °C for 2 h. The stability of the NFL-1000 mRNA was significantly increased in control tissue homogenates, with a modest increase observed in boiled ALS tissue homogenates, such that the stability of the NFL-1000 mRNA was comparable between the two boiled homogenates. There was no significant difference in NFL-1000 mRNA stability when exposed to boiled homogenates of either ALS or control tissue (p > 0.05) (Fig. 3A). Homogenates were also incubated with 0, 25, 50, 100 μg/ml protease K before incubation with RNA. Again, the stability of the NFL-1000 mRNA incubated with control spinal cord protein homogenates significantly increased in a dose-dependent fashion, whereas no change was noted following protease K digest of the ALS homogenates. At the higher concentration of protease K, the stability of NFL-1000 was identical when incubated with either ALS or control homogenates (p > 0.05) (Fig. 3B). The results strongly suggested the presence of protein factor(s) that destabilize NFL-1000 mRNA in control protein homogenates, which were absent from the ALS tissues. The stability differentiation of NFL-1000 mRNA in ALS versus control homogenates was further investigated using blended homogenates in which the ratio of control- to ALS-derived spinal cord homogenate was varied between 100% control- and 100% ALS-derived homogenate. Heterogeneously expressed NFL-1000 mRNA was incubated with admixed spinal cord homogenate, and after 2 h, the amount of remaining NFL mRNA was determined using real time RT-PCR. With increasing amounts of ALS-derived homogenate, an increasing stability of NFL mRNA was observed (Fig. 4). This confirmed the presence of a trans-acting NFL mRNA-destabilizing factor unique to control spinal cord homogenates and not evident in ALS spinal cord. Because regulatory factors may affect mRNA stability in vivo via various mechanisms, including direct binding to cis-acting stability determinants on the mRNA, we undertook gel retardation assays to determine whether the trans-acting elements observed in control spinal cord homogenates might function in this manner. We showed that the control-derived homogenate contained proteins that bound directly to NFL mRNA and that these elements were absent in ALS-derived homogenates (Fig. 5). We observed NFL mRNA binding protein factors in control homogenates that were absent in ALS-derived homogenates. Combined with the preceding results, these observations confirm the presence of trans-acting NFL mRNA-destabilizing factors in control spinal cord that bind to the NFL mRNA and facilitate the degradation of the mRNA. Effect of 3′-UTR Deletion on the Stability of NFL-1000 mRNA in ALS and Control Homogenates—The 3′-UTR is important for the stability regulation of mRNA species. For mouse NFL, several stability determinants have been located within this region (21Cañete-Soler R. Schwartz M.L. Hua Y. Schlaepfer W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12655-12661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 24Cañete-Soler R. Schwartz M.L. Hua Y. Schlaepfer W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12651-12654Google Scholar). By deleting the full length of 3′-UTR from NFL-1000 (NFL-CDS), the differential mRNA stability in ALS and control homogenates was abolished from the different level of enhancement in the mRNA stability (Fig. 6), revealing that the 3′-UTR harbors cis-acting instability element(s) for the differential NFL stability between ALS and control spinal cord homogenates. In this paper, we report elevated steady state mRNA levels for all three NF subunits in ALS lumbar ventral spinal cord using RNase protection assay and quantitative real time RT-PCR. Our observations also demonstrate the presence of trans-acting NFL mRNA-destabilizing elements that interact with the 3′-UTR of NFL mRNA and that are either not expressed in ALS spinal cord or nonfunctional. The observations of the gel retardation assay would favor the former possibility. Our results suggest that the elevated steady state NFL mRNA levels observed in ALS spinal cord resulted from an enhanced stability of NFL mRNA in ALS spinal cord and that this is due to the absence of trans-acting NFL mRNA-destabilizing elements. It has been previously shown that NF steady state mRNA levels are independent of NF gene transcription and that NF mRNA stabilization is the main factor regulating the steady state levels of NFs mRNA in postnatal rat brain (25Moskowitz P.F. Oblinger M.M. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1995; 30: 211-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The expression of regulatory factors for NF expression is developmentally regulated (26Schwartz M.L. Shneidman P.S. Bruce J. Schlaepfer W.W. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 27: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These factors, including p190RhoGEF (27Cañete-Soler R. Wu J. Zhai J Shamim M. Schlaepfer W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32046-32050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), bind to stability determinants on NFL mRNA (24Cañete-Soler R. Schwartz M.L. Hua Y. Schlaepfer W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12651-12654Google Scholar) in ribonucleoprotein complexes (21Cañete-Soler R. Schwartz M.L. Hua Y. Schlaepfer W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12655-12661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). A similar complex may also regulate the stability of NFH mRNA (28Cat́nete-Soler R. Schlaepfer W.W. Brain Res. 2000; 867: 265-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and neuron-specific small BC1 RNA (29Ge W. Wu J. Zhai J. Nie Z. Lin H. Schlaepfer W.W. Cañete-Soler R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42701-42705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Potentially, the stability regulation of NFL mRNA is thus linked to other cellular events in neurons. The recent observation that NFL mRNA steady state levels are suppressed in NSC34 cells that were stably transfected with mutant human copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1 G93A) (17Menzies F.M. Grierson A.J. Cookson M.R. Heath P.R. Tomkins J. Figlewicz D.A. Ince P.G. Shaw P.J. J. Neurochem. 2002; 82: 1118-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) is potentially one such example. Our current results appear to contradict our previous report, in which, when evaluated by in situ hybridization, NFL mRNA levels were found to be selectively reduced in degenerative motor neurons in ALS (15Wong N.K. He B.P. Strong M.J. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2000; 59: 972-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The difference may not be as contradictory as it seems, if it is taken into consideration that the in situ hybridization assay focused in motor neurons, whereas RNase protection assay and real time PCR checked the expression level of NFs in spinal cord homogenates, which is the mixture of overall neuronal population. The contradiction may actually imply the existence of specific NF expression regulation within motor neurons relative to the rest neuronal population in ALS. NF expression is naturally heterogeneous among neuronal subtypes throughout the nervous system (30Vickers J.C. Costa M. Neurosci. 1992; 49: 73-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 31Kure R. Brown I.R. Neurochem. Res. 1995; 20: 833-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 32Chan S.O. Peng D. Chiu F.C.

Neuroanat. 2002; 24: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar); thus, it is not without precedent to see different NFs expression patterns and regulation mechanisms for motor neurons relative to the overall neuronal population. It has now been established that NF overexpression can have protective effects against motor neuron death in a variety of murine models of motor neurons degeneration (34Julien J.P. Couillard-Despres S. Meier J. Brain Pathol. 1998; 8: 759-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 35Couillard-Despres S. Zhu Q. Wong P.C. Price D.L. Cleveland D.W. Julien J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad.

We have also recently reported that, in vitro, a failure to express NFL places motor neurons at a greater risk for oxidatively mediated cell death (37Strong, M., Sopper, M., and He, B. P. (2003) Amyotroph. Lateral Scler. Other Motor Neuron Disord., in pressGoogle Scholar). We are proposing that, under normal physiological stress, trans-acting NFL instability element expression would be suppressed, resulting in elevated levels of NFL protein. In non-motor neuron populations in the ALS spinal cord, this would appear to be the case. However, within the motor neuron pool, this fails to occur, resulting in a selective vulnerability to the disease process. Experiments are currently in progress to address this issue. NSC34 cells were a generous gift of Dr. Neil Cashman (University of Toronto)."

NO is a molecule with diverse physiological effects, including neurotransmission, hemodynamic regulation, and cytotoxicity. There are three isoforms of NOS, neuronal (nNOS), endothelial (eNOS), and macrophage (iNOS), which are differentially expressed, modified, and regulated (for review, see Ref. 1Masters B.S.S. Ignarro L.J. Nitric Oxide, Biology, and Pathobiology. Academic Press, Inc., New York2000: 91-104Google Scholar, 2Roman L.J. Martásek P. Masters B.S.S. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 1179-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 3Michel T. Feron O. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2146-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). They are arranged in a domain structure, with an N-terminal oxygenase domain, containing the heme active site, the arginine binding site, and the tetrahydrobiopterin cofactor site, and a C-terminal reductase domain, containing FAD and FMN cofactors and the NADPH binding site, connected by a calmodulin (CaM) binding sequence. The transfer of electrons is from NADPH to FAD to FMN to the heme, reminiscent of the cytochrome P450 system. The binding of CaM, however, is required for the NOSs to transfer electrons from the reductase domain to the heme where catalysis occurs. Despite the fact that all three NOS isoforms share 50–60% overall sequence similarity, each of the NOS isoforms is intrinsically different from the other with regard to rates of NO synthesis, cytochrome c reduction, electron transfer, and heme-nitrosyl complex formation. Thus, structural differences existing among the various isoforms must account for this variability. The structures of the heme domains of all three NOS isoforms have been solved and exhibit apparently minor differences, except in their initial N-terminal sequences (4Crane B.R. Arvai A.S. Ghosh D.K.

Chimeric enzymes in which the heme domain of one isoform is connected to the flavin domain of another (7Nishida C.R. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5566-5571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) indicated that the identity of the flavin domain rather than that of the heme domain determined the rates of NO synthesis and cytochrome c reduction. The crystal structures of the entire reductase domains have not yet been reported, but several regulatory elements in this domain have been identified and characterized (for review, see Ref. 2Roman L.J. Martásek P. Masters B.S.S. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 1179-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In addition to the CaM binding sequence, an autoregulatory insert was identified in the FMN binding region of the constitutively expressed isoforms, nNOS and eNOS, but not in the inducible isoform, iNOS (8Salerno J.C. Harris D.E. Irizarry K. Patel B. Morales A.J. Smith S.M.E. Martásek P. Roman L.J. Masters B.S.S. Jones C.L. Weissman B.A. Lane P. Liu Q. Gross S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29769-29777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). This autoregulatory insert obstructs transfer of electrons into the heme domain in the absence of CaM. In the presence of CaM, this impediment is at least partially relieved, and electron flux to the heme can occur. If the autoregulatory insert is completely removed, the rate of electron flow increases, indicating that this element intrinsically regulates electron flow to the heme, even in the presence of CaM (9Daff S.

An extension of between 21–42 amino acids, beyond the residues homologous to the terminus of CYPOR, impedes electron flow through the flavin domain in the absence of CaM (12Roman L.J.

The crystal structure of the FAD and NADPH binding regions suggests that this tail region bisects the flavin domain between the FMN and FAD and emerges on the other side of the molecule (14Zhang J.

In the presence of CaM, this blockade is partially removed, presumably by repositioning of the tail, facilitating flux between the flavins (12Roman L.J. Miller R.T. de la Garza M.A. Kim J.-J.

Although the amino acid sequence of the nNOS reductase domain is 58% similar to that of CYPOR (22Bredt D.S. Hwang P.M. Glatt C.E. Lowenstein C. Reed R.R. Snyder S.H. Nature. 1991; 351: 714-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (2165) Google Scholar), CYPOR completely lacks the two aforementioned regulatory elements. The crystal structure of CYPOR, unlike that of the NOS reductase domains, has been solved (23Wang M. Roberts. D.L. Paschke R. Shea T.M. Masters B.S. Kim J.-J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Given the similarity in sequence, the presumed similarity in structure, and the contrast in strict regulatory elements present in the NOS reductase domains but absent in CYPOR, chimeric enzymes were created in which the FMN and/or FAD binding subdomains of CYPOR are incorporated into nNOS. These chimeric molecules were used to investigate the interplay between these elements and other domain sequences and their effects on electron flow by measuring their capacities to catalyze both flavoprotein-mediated electron transport and heme-mediated NO production.

The correct construct was then used to cotransform E. coli BL21 cells along with groELS plasmid. nNOS, CYPOR, and chimeric proteins were expressed and purified as previously described (24Roman L.J.

A. 1995; 92: 8428-8432Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) except that cultures were grown in 500 ml of medium in Fernbach flasks, all of the column equilibration and wash buffers contained 100 mm NaCl, and the protein was eluted with buffer containing 500 mm NaCl and 15 mm 2′,3′-AMP. The reductase proteins (CYPOR, CFMN/nNOSFAD,NADPH, and CFMN/nNOSFAD,NADPH(tr1)) were fully oxidized by ferricyanide titration before gel filtration chromatography. Calmodulin was prepared by the method of Zhang and Vogel (25Zhang M. Vogel H.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1163-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Based on the gel filtration chromatography step, all of the heme domain-containing chimeras were primarily dimeric, including NCC, which contains no nNOS-derived reductase domain modules, indicating that all the determinants necessary for dimerization are contained within the heme domain of nNOS. CO difference spectra were performed as described (24Roman L.J. Sheta E.A. Martásek P. Gross S.R. Liu Q. Masters B.S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8428-8432Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The molar protein concentrations for heme-containing chimeras were determined based on heme content via reduced CO difference spectra, where ϵ = 100 mm–1cm–1 for ΔA445–470. The molar protein concentrations for non-heme-containing chimeras were determined based on flavin content via absolute absorbance, where ϵ = 21 mm–1cm–1 (10.5 mm–1cm–1/flavin) at 454 nm. All spectral analyses were performed using a Shimadzu model 2401PC UV-visible dual-beam spectrophotometer. Stopped-flow reactions were performed aerobically under turnover conditions at 23 °C, as described in Miller et al. (26Miller R.T. Martasek P. Omura T. Masters B.S.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 265: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and Roman et al. (12Roman L.J. Miller R.T. de la Garza M.A. Kim J.-J. Masters B.S.S. J. Biol.

Reactions contained 3 μm enzyme and 100 μm NADPH in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 100 mm NaCl. Where indicated, 10 μm CaM was also added. Flavin reduction was monitored at 485 nm. Nitric oxide formation (hemoglobin capture assay) and cytochrome c reduction were measured at 23 °C as described (27Sheta E. McMillan K. Masters B.S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15147-15153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Martásek P. Miller R.T. Roman L.J. Shea T.M. Masters B.S.S. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 301: 70-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), with the exception that both assays were performed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 100 mm NaCl. Rates of NO synthesis and cytochrome c reduction were determined using extinction coefficients of 60 mm–1cm–1 at 401 nm and 21 mm–1cm–1 at 550 nm, respectively. Ferricyanide reduction was performed in the same manner as cytochrome c reduction, except that the ferricyanide concentration was varied, and the extinction coefficient was 1.02 mm–1 cm–1 at 420 nm. The reoxidation of reduced flavins was monitored at 485 nm for all enzymes in the presence of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 20 μm NADPH, and 2 μm enzyme at 23°. Expression and Spectral Characterization of Chimeric Enzymes—All of the chimeric enzymes expressed very well in E. coli, with yields comparable with those of wild-type nNOS and CYPOR (i.e. 100–150 nmol/liter cells), and all were of the correct mass as visualized by SDS-PAGE. All of the chimeric enzymes looked spectrally healthy. All chimeric holoenzymes contained both heme and flavins, as determined by absolute spectra, and were isolated in a mixed low spin/high spin form that shifted completely to low spin with the addition of 1 mm imidazole and completely to high spin upon the addition of 100 μm arginine (Fig. 2A). The absorbance peak shifted an additional 4 nm lower upon the addition of H4B (not shown), suggesting that the binding site for this cofactor is intact. All formed the characteristic peak at ∼445 nm in the reduced, CO-bound form, indicating proper insertion of the heme moiety in the chimeras. Spectral measurement of the binding constant for arginine (K s) yielded values comparable with that of wild-type NOS (717 nm; Ref. 24Roman L.J. Sheta E.A. Martásek P. Gross S.R. Liu Q. Masters B.S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8428-8432Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Shown in Fig. 2B are the substrate difference spectra for titration of nNOSox/CFMN,FAD,NADPH by arginine, which yielded K s = ∼300 nm. The similarity of these values to the wild type suggests that the binding site for arginine is unimpaired in the chimeras. All of these characteristics are similar in both the wild-type and chimeric proteins, suggesting an intact and potentially functional heme domain. All of the non-heme domain-containing flavoprotein constructs were isolated as greenish in color, indicating the formation of an air-stable flavin semiquinone, which was confirmed spectrophotometrically (not shown), as is typically seen with CYPOR. This semiquinone form persisted until oxidized by the addition of ferricyanide. None of the chimeras were as stable as nNOS or CYPOR, as judged by loss of activity over a period of a week on ice, but all were stable (less than 10% drop in activity) for at least 2 days. Therefore, all activity measurements were performed on freshly prepared enzyme within 2 days of isolation. Cytochrome c Reduction—To determine the functionality of the reductase domains, cytochrome c reduction was assayed. Reduction of cytochrome c involves passage of electrons from NADPH to FAD to FMN to cytochrome c and, thus, requires an intact reductase domain. Fig. 3 shows that all of the chimeric holoenzymes were able to reduce cytochrome c. Wild-type nNOS, nNOS (tr1), and CYPOR are shown for comparison. As reported previously, the rates of reduction by nNOS and nNOS (tr1) in the presence of CaM are very similar to that of CYPOR, ∼3000–4500 min–1. The K m values for cytochrome c were determined for all of the enzymes shown, and all are between 3–6 μm (not shown), so any differences observed among the chimeras are not due to altered interaction with cytochrome c. The profile for NNC resembles that of nNOS (tr1) in that in the absence of CaM, cytochrome c reduction is very high, 2–2.5-fold higher than either CYPOR or nNOS in the presence of CaM. In the presence of CaM, cytochrome c activity decreases by 75%, to a level half that of CYPOR. NNC retains the autoregulatory insert in the FMN subdomain but has lost the regulatory tail region. NCN and NCN (tr1) reduce c"

A 23-kb region of DNA from Arthrobacter ilicis Rü61a was cloned into the cosmid pVK100. Although Escherichia coli clones containing the recombinant cosmid did not transform quinaldine, cosmids harboring the 23-kb region, or a 10.8-kb stretch of this region, conferred to Pseudomonas putida KT2440 the ability to cometabolically convert quinaldine to anthranilate. The 10.8-kb fragment thus contains the genes coding for quinaldine 4-oxidase (Qox), 1H-4-oxoquinaldine 3-monooxygenase, 1H-3-hydroxy-4-oxoquinaldine 2,4-dioxygenase, and N-acetylanthranilate amidase. The qoxLMS genes coding for the molybdopterin cytosine dinucleotide-(MCD-), FeSI-, FeSII-, and FAD-containing Qox were inserted into the expression vector pJB653, generating pKP1. Qox is the first MCD-containing enzyme to be synthesized in a catalytically fully competent form by a heterologous host, P. putida KT2440 pKP1; the catalytic properties and the UV-visible and EPR spectra of Qox purified from P. putida KT2440 pKP1 were essentially like those of wild-type Qox. This provides a starting point for the construction of protein variants of Qox by site-directed mutagenesis. Downstream of the qoxLMS genes, a putative gene whose deduced amino acid sequence showed 37% similarity to the cofactor-inserting chaperone XdhC was located. Additional open reading frames identified on the 23-kb segment may encode further enzymes (a glutamyl tRNA synthetase, an esterase, two short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases, an ATPase belonging to the AAA family, a 2-hydroxyhepta-2,4-diene-1,7-dioate isomerase/5-oxopent-3-ene-1,2,5-tricarboxylate decarboxylase-like protein, and an enzyme of the mandelate racemase group) and hypothetical proteins involved in transcriptional regulation, and metabolite transport.

The genetic diversity and flexibility of prokaryotes has led to the evolution of an impressive variety of metabolic pathways to transform or degrade natural as well as numerous xenobiotic compounds. The genes coding for enzymes involved in degradative pathways are often organized as operons and supraoperonic clusters comprising “pathway modules” (1van der Meer J.R. de Vos W.M. Harayama S.

The catalytic relevance of these residues can be assessed by constructing protein variants carrying amino acid replacements and their biochemical, spectroscopic, and structural characterization. Replacement of a distinct amino acid residue in a protein can be performed by site-directed mutagenesis. However, a prerequisite for such a mutagenesis approach is the availability of a suitable system for the genetic manipulation and for the regulated, functional expression of the genes coding for the enzyme to be investigated.

Synthesis of catalytically fully competent Qor was only achieved when using a ΔqorMSL mutant of the donor strain P. putida 86 as recipient for the expression plasmid (29Frerichs-Deeken U.

Ior protein showing minor activity was synthesized from the respective expression plasmid when using the Qor-producing strain P. putida 86 as a host, suggesting that accessory gene(s) encoding product(s) essential for the synthesis or assembly of the enzyme is(are) part of the quinoline regulon in P. putida 86 (30Israel I.

The amino acid sequences deduced from the qox genes are compared with those of other molybdenum hydroxylases. Due to the broad substrate specificity of Qox, which in addition to different N-heteroaromatic compounds oxidizes aromatic aldehydes (8Stephan I. Tshisuaka B. Fetzner S. Lingens F. Eur. J.

Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and E. coli XL1-Blue MRF′ (Stratagene), used for cloning procedures with pUC18, were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth (32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) at 37 °C. If appropriate, E. coli and P. putida KT2440 cultures contained the following antibiotics: ampicillin (60 and 500 μg/ml for E. coli DH5α and P. putida KT2440 pKP1, respectively), tetracycline (15 μg/ml), and kanamycin (50 μg/ml). To investigate functional expression of the qox genes in the cosmid clone E. coli HB101 pVK55B/5, it was grown at 37 °C on mineral salts medium containing (per liter) 0.2 g of MgSO4 × 7H2O, 4 g of (NH4)2SO4, 5.25 g of K2HPO4, 2.25 g of KH2PO4, 2.7 mg of FeCl3 × 6H2O, and 8 g of glucose as carbon source. The medium was supplemented with 15 μg/ml of each proline and leucine, and 2 ml/liter vitamin solution (33Röger P. Erben A. Lingens F. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1990; 371: 511-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar); 0.1 ml/liter quinaldine was added when the culture reached an optical density (600 nm) of about 0.8. P. putida KT2440 pKP1 was grown in the mineral salt medium described by Tshisuaka et al. (15Tshisuaka B. Kappl R. Hüttermann J. Lingens F. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12928-12934Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) with 8 mm benzoate as carbon and energy source and as XylS effector, and with 1 g/liter (NH4)2SO4. As an additional XylS effector, 2 mm 2-methylbenzoate was added at an optical density (600 nm) of 0.8–1.2. To generate biomass for protein purification, cells were grown in two glass fermenters (4-liters each) to which benzoate was added repeatedly. At an optical density (600 nm) of about 3, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. For the preparation of electrocompetent cells, E. coli DH5α, E. coli XL1-Blue MRF′, and P. putida KT2440 were cultured in TB medium (32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T.

Quinaldine conversion was monitored spectrophotometrically in the culture supernatant. Spectra were compared with those of authentic references diluted in the same medium. Qox activity was measured in the cell free extracts, obtained after cell disruption by sonification, and centrifugation at 48,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C.DNA Techniques—Genomic DNA of A. ilicis Rü61a was isolated according to Hopwood et al. (35Hopwood D.A. Bibb M.J. Chater K.F. Kieser T. Bruton C.J. Kieser H.M. Lydiate C.P. Ward J.M. Schrempf H. Genetic Manipulation of Streptomyces, a Laboratory Manual. The John Innes Foundation, Norwich, UK1985Google Scholar). Plasmid and cosmid DNA was isolated with the Qiagen Plasmid Mini- and Midi kits, respectively (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Gel extraction of DNA fragments for cloning was done with the Nucleo Spin® extraction kit of Macherey-Nagel (Düren, Germany); however, DNA fragments larger than 10 kb were size-fractionated in 0.5% low melting agarose gels and extracted by agarase treatment. DNA restriction, dephosphorylation, and ligation and agarose gel electrophoresis were carried out using standard procedures (32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Electrocompetent cells were generated according to Dower et al. (36Dower W.J. Miller J.F. Ragsdale C.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 6127-6145Crossref PubMed Scopus (2152) Google Scholar) and Iwasaki et al. (37Iwasaki K. Uchiyama H. Yagi O. Kurabayashi T. Ishizuku K. Takamura Y. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1994; 58: 851-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).Construction of Genomic Libraries—To generate an enriched gene library for A. ilicis Rü61a, genomic DNA, restricted with SmaI, was separated in agarose gels and vacuum-blotted to nylon membranes (parablot NY plus from Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany). Fragments in the size of 4–5 kb showing positive hybridization signals with the probe “b-DIG” (see below) were extracted from an agarose gel and ligated to the SmaI-digested, dephosphorylated vector pUC18 (38Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1982; 19: 259-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (3770) Google Scholar). E. coli XL1-Blue MRF′ transformants were screened by colony blotting and identified by Southern hybridization of SmaI-restricted plasmids, using the probe b-DIG.For construction of a cosmid library, genomic DNA of A. ilicis Rü61a was partially restricted with HindIII. DNA fragments ranging in size from 15 to 25 kb were extracted from a 0.5% low melting agarose gel and ligated to the HindIII-digested, dephosphorylated cosmid vector pVK100 (39Knauf V.C. Nester E W. Plasmid. 1982; 8: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The cosmids were packaged in vitro into lambda phage particles using a commercial extract (DNA Packaging kit from Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany). The preparation was used to infect E. coli HB101, which was selected for tetracycline resistance (Tcr) and kanamycin sensitivity (Kms). The clone library was screened by colony blotting and hybridization with a probe described below as “1.1 DpnI.”DNA Probes and Hybridization—The oligonucleotide probe b-DIG, which was 5′-end-labeled with a digoxigenin derivative, was a degenerated 29-mer: 5′-TTY ATG CAY CCN TTY CAR TTY ATH ACN CC-3′ (following the IUPAC ambiguity code), deduced from the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the medium-sized subunit of Qox (FMH-PFQFITP) (7de Beyer A. Lingens F. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 374: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Prehybridization for 2 h and hybridization overnight with b-DIG was carried out at 54.5 °C. The membranes were stringently washed for 2 × 15 min in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature, 2 × 15 min in 0.5× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 54.5 °C, and 2 × 15 min in 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 54.5 °C. Screening an enriched gene library of A. ilicis Rü61a established in the vector pUC18 with b-DIG revealed a clone containing an insert of 4580 bp (pUC55/4.5). Isolation of a 1052-bp DpnI fragment from this insert led to the specific probe 1.1 DpnI, which was used to screen the cosmid clone library. 1.1 DpnI hybridizes with the 5′-terminal half of qoxL (Fig. 1). After prehybridization for 2 h and hybridization overnight with the probe 1.1 DpnI at 68 °C, the membranes were washed twice for 15 min in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature and twice for 15 min in 0.5× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 68 °C. Random primed labeling of the probe 1.1 DpnI using the DIG-High Prime DNA labeling kit (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany), Southern and colony blotting, hybridization, and colorimetric detection with nitroblue tetrazolium salt and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate were performed following the DIG System User's Guide for Filter Hybridization (40Roche molecular biochemicals The DIG System User′s Guide for Filter Hybridization. Boehringer Mannheim GmbH, Mannheim, Germany1995Google Scholar).Subcloning Procedures—Restriction of the recombinant cosmid pVK55B/5 with HindIII produced two fragments of 12,203 and 10,812 bp, respectively, beside the 23-kb vector. These two fragments were separately inserted into the HindIII cleavage site of pUC18, generating pUC55/12 and pUC55/11. The 10.8-kb fragment was also inserted into the cosmid vector pVK100 (forming pVK55/11) to propagate it in P. putida KT2440. When pUC55/11 was restricted with SmaI, three fragments were generated, the internal 4.58-kb fragment showing the positive signal with probe b-DIG, and two fragments of 2,978 and 3,254 bp, respectively (Fig. 1). The 4.58-kb fragment was cloned into the SmaI site of pUC18 (forming pUC55/4.5). The 2.97-kb fragment and the 3.25-kb fragment were removed from pUC55/11 by SmaI-HindIII and SmaI digestion, respectively. Both fragments were separately cloned into the multiple cloning site of pUC18, yielding pUC55/3 and pUC55/3.2. All pUC derivatives were transferred to E. coli DH5α by electroporation.Expression Cloning of qoxLMS Genes—Using the cosmid pVK55B/5 as template, the qoxLMS genes were amplified with Pfu polymerase. The forward primer was chosen to contain the assumed Shine-Dalgarno sequence (in italics) preceding the qox genes, and an EcoRI recognition site (underlined): 5′-ACGCGAATTC GTGACGAAGTTAAGGAGACC-3′; the nucleotides set in boldface are complementary to nucleotides 17,492–17,511 of EMBL accession number AJ537472. The reverse primer was completely complementary to nucleotides 21,401–21,375 of EMBL accession number AJ537472: 5′-TTTGGAATGCGCAGTGAGGAGATTTGC-3′. After EcoRI restriction the PCR product was ligated into the EcoRI- and SmaI-restricted plasmid pJB653 (41Blatny J.M. Brautaset T. Winther-Larsen H.C. Haugan K. Valla S. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 370-379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), generating pKP1. The recipient P. putida KT2440 was transformed by electroporation (36Dower W.J. Miller J.F. Ragsdale C.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 6127-6145Crossref PubMed Scopus (2152) Google Scholar).DNA Sequencing and Comparative Sequence Analysis—The genes and open reading frames shown in Fig. 1 were deduced from computer-assisted analysis of sequences obtained from single strand sequencing of the inserts of pUC55/12, pUC55/3, pUC55/4.5, and pUC55/3.2; sequences of the qox genes were verified by sequencing both strands. Sequencing was carried out according to the method of Sanger et al. (42Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

https://openalex.org/W2100845424,"Scavenger receptor class B, type I (SR-BI) shows a variety of effects on cellular cholesterol metabolism, including increased selective uptake of high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesteryl ester, stimulation of free cholesterol (FC) efflux from cells to HDL and phospholipid vesicles, and changes in the distribution of plasma membrane FC as evidenced by increased susceptibility to exogenous cholesterol oxidase. Previous studies showed that these multiple effects require the extracellular domain of SR-BI, but not the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. To test whether 1) the extracellular domain of SR-BI mediates multiple activities by virtue of discrete functional subdomains, or 2) the multiple activities are, in fact, secondary to and driven by changes in cholesterol flux, the extracellular domain of SR-BI was subjected to insertional mutagenesis by strategically placing an epitope tag into nine sites. These experiments identified four classes of mutants with disruptions at different levels of function. Class 4 mutants showed a clear separation of function between HDL binding, HDL cholesteryl ester uptake, and HDL-dependent FC efflux on one hand and FC efflux to small unilamellar vesicles and an increased cholesterol oxidase-sensitive pool of membrane FC on the other. Selective disruption of the latter two functions provides evidence for multiple functional subdomains in the extracellular receptor domain. Furthermore, these findings uncover a difference in the SR-BI-mediated efflux pathways for FC transfer to HDL acceptors versus phospholipid vesicles. The loss of the cholesterol oxidase-sensitive FC pool and FC efflux to small unilamellar vesicle acceptors in Class 4 mutants suggests that these activities may be mechanistically related.

Taken together, these studies are consistent with SR-BI playing a major role in HDL cholesterol metabolism in vivo. SR-BI mediates its effects on HDL CE metabolism by facilitating the transport of lipids to cells in a process termed selective uptake (3Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M.

Contrary to the classic low density lipoprotein receptor endocytic pathway, in which the entire lipoprotein is internalized in clathrin-coated pits and degraded (24Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L.

Furthermore, low density lipoprotein CE delivered by the low density lipoprotein receptor is hydrolyzed in the lysosomal pathway by an acidic CE hydrolase (24Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Science. 1986; 232: 34-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (4383) Google Scholar, 25Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Anderson R.G. Russell D.W. Schneider W.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1985; 1: 1-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar), whereas HDL CE delivered by SR-BI is hydrolyzed extralysosomally (26Sparrow C.P. Pittman R.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1043: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) by a neutral CE hydrolase (27DeLamatre J.G. Carter R.M. Hornick C.A. J. Cell.

Acta. 1994; 1215: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In fact, SR-BI has been shown to deliver HDL CE into a metabolically active membrane pool, where it is efficiently hydrolyzed by cell type-specific neutral CE hydrolases (29Connelly M.A. Kellner-Weiber G. Rothblat G.H. Williams D.L. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 331-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In addition to the uptake and metabolism of HDL CE, SR-BI stimulates the bidirectional flux of free cholesterol (FC) between cultured cells and lipoproteins (30Ji Y. Jian B. Wang N.

SR-BI also increases cellular cholesterol mass and alters cholesterol distribution in plasma membrane domains as judged by the enhanced sensitivity of membrane cholesterol to extracellular cholesterol oxidase (31de la Llera-Moya M.

Rothblat G.H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Moreover, the delivery of HDL FC by SR-BI results in efficient delivery of FC for esterification (36Kellner-Weibel G. de la Llera-Moya M. Connelly M.A. Stoudt G. Christian A.E. Haynes M.P. Williams D.L. Rothblat G.H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 37Connelly M.A. de la Llera-Moya M. Monzo P. Yancey P. Drazul D. Stoudt G. Fournier N. Klein S.M. Rothblat G.H. Williams D.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5249-5259Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Together, these data support the idea that, similar to HDL CE, SR-BI delivers HDL FC into a metabolically active membrane pool. Whether this membrane pool reflects the localization of SR-BI in a physically distinct membrane domain or its interaction with other membrane proteins is not known. Previous studies have shown that several key lipid transport functions of SR-BI, including the ability to alter membrane cholesterol domains, are dependent on its extracellular region (37Connelly M.A. de la Llera-Moya M. Monzo P. Yancey P. Drazul D. Stoudt G. Fournier N. Klein S.M. Rothblat G.H. Williams D.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5249-5259Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 38Gu X. Trigatti B. Xu S.

J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 41-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). However, to date, it is unclear whether 1) the extracellular domain of SR-BI mediates multiple distinct activities by virtue of discrete functional domains or 2) the distinct functions of SR-BI are, in fact, secondary to, and driven by, changes in cellular cholesterol content and distribution. To address this question, we mutagenized the extracellular domain of murine SR-BI by strategically placing an epitope tag from the adenovirus E4/5 protein into nine sites in the SR-BI extracellular domain (designated A-II through A-X in Fig. 1 and “Experimental Procedures”). We expressed the mutant receptors in COS-7 cells, checked for cell-surface expression of the mutant receptors, and assessed the ability of these epitope-tagged mutants to mediate multiple aspects of cellular lipid metabolism. These experiments identified four classes of SR-BI mutants that revealed that 1) all SR-BI activities do not derive from the ability of SR-BI to load cholesterol into the plasma membrane, and 2) there is a separation of function between SR-BI-mediated HDL CE uptake and HDL FC efflux on one hand and FC efflux to small unilamellar vesicle (SUV) acceptors and an increased cholesterol oxidase-sensitive pool of membrane FC on the other. These data provide clear evidence for a difference in the pathways for SR-BI-mediated FC efflux to HDL and to phospholipid vesicles. Materials—The following antibodies were used: anti-M45 epitope hybridoma medium (a generous gift from Dr. Patrick Hearing, State University of New York, Stony Brook; 1:100 for immunofluorescence, 1:250 for flow cytometry, and 1:500 for immunoblotting) (40Obert S.

Plasmids and Sequencing—PCR amplifications were performed using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences DNA Thermal Cycler 9700. Oligonucleotides were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies. The “seamless cloning” technique from Stratagene was modified and employed to clone monoclonal antibody epitopes into the extracellular domain of murine SR-BI. For construction of A-II, primers 5′-AGCCAGCTCTTCACTACCTCCTTTTGAGACAGAGACGATCCTGTGGGGCTATGACGATC-3′ and 5′-AGCTAGCTCTTCATAGGCGATCCCTACTCCGATCCTCACCAACTGTGCGGTTC-3′ were employed to amplify the entire pSG5(mSR-BI) plasmid. The resulting PCR product was digested with SapI (New England Biolabs Inc.) and recircularized. This resulted in the insertion of a 14-amino acid M45 monoclonal antibody epitope (DRSRDRLPPFETET) (40Obert S. O'Connor R.J. Schmid S. Hearing P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1333-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) into SR-BI, C-terminal to amino acid 179. For construction of A-III, primers 5′-AGCCAGCTCTTCACTACCTCCTTTTGAGACAGAGACGAAGCTGACCTACAACGAATC-3′ and 5′-AGCTAGCTCTTCATAGGCGATCCCTACTCCGATCCATGGACCTGCATGCCTC-3′ were employed to insert the M45 epitope C-terminal to amino acid 283. For construction of A-IV, primers 5′-AGCCAGCTCTTCACTACCTCCTTTTGAGACAGAGACGCAGCTGAGCCTCTACATCAAATCTGTC-3′ and 5′-AGCTAGCTCTTCATAGGCGATCCCTACTCCGATCCATCTTCACAGAACAGTTCATGGGG-3′ were employed to insert the M45 epitope C-terminal to amino acid 388. For construction of A-V, primers 5′-AGCCAGCTCTTCACTACCTCCTTTTGAGACAGAGACGCTCTCCCACCCCCACTTTTAC-3′ and 5′-AGCTAGCTCTTCATAGGCGATCCCTACTCCGATCAAACAGAGGCGCACCAAAC-3′ were employed to insert the M45 epitope C-terminal to amino acid 341. For construction of A-VI, primers 5′-AGCCAGCTCTTCACTACCTCCTTTTGAGACAGAGACGAAGCCCCTGAGCACGTTCTAC-3′ and 5′-AGCCAGCTCTTCATAGCCTGTCCCTACTCCGATCGCCACCCATTGCTCCGCTCTG-3′ were employed to insert the M45 epitope C-terminal to amino acid 424. For construction of A-VII, primers 5′-AGCCAGCTCTTCACTACCTCCTTTTGAGACAGAGACGTCAAGGGTGTTTGAAGGCATTC-3′ and 5′-AGCCAGCTCTTCATAGGCGATCCCTACTCCGATCTTCGTTGTAGGTCAGCTTCATGG-3′ were employed to insert the M45 epitope C-terminal to amino acid 289. For construction of A-VIII, primers 5′-AGCCAGCTCTTCACTACCTCCTTTTGAGACAGAGACGACGTACCTCCCAGACATGCTTC-3′ and 5′-AGCGAGCTCTTCATAGGCTATCCCTACTCCGATCATTGAGAAAATGCACGAAGGG-3′ were employed to insert the M45 epitope C-terminal to amino acid 192. For construction of A-IX, primers 5′-AGCCAGCTCTTCACTACCTCCTTTTGAGACAGAGACGAACGGGCAGAAGCCAGTAGTC-3′ and 5′-AGCCAGCTCTTCATAGTCTATCCCTACTCCGATCGAGGACCTCGTTTGGGTTGAC-3′ were employed to insert the M45 epitope C-terminal to amino acid 79. For construction of A-X, primers 5′-AGCCAGCTCTTCACTACCTCCTTTTGAGACAGAGACGAGCAGCCTGTCCTTCGGG-3′ and 5′-AGCCAGCTCTTCATAGGCGATCCCTACTCCGATCCGGGTCTATGCGGACATTC-3′ were employed to insert the M45 epitope C-terminal to amino acid 48. For construction of H-VI, primers 5′-AGCTAGCTCTTCACATCATCACACGTTCTACACGCAGCTGGTG-3′ and 5′-AGCTAGCTCTTCTATGATGGTGATGCATTGCTCCGCTCTGTTCG-3′ were employed to replace amino acids 423–428 of SR-BI with six histidines. This created an anti-histidine monoclonal antibody epitope (HHHHHH). All plasmids were prepared using endotoxin-free QIAGEN maxi-prep kits and sequenced throughout the SR-BI coding region to confirm the correct epitope insertion and to ensure that no point mutations had been generated during the amplification process. DNA sequencing was performed by the automated sequencing facility at the State University of New York (Stony Brook). Reactions were prepared using a dye termination cycle sequencing kit and analyzed on an Applied Biosystems Model 373 DNA Sequencer with an Excel upgrade as recommended by the manufacturer (PE Applied Biosystems). Transient Transfection of COS-7 Cells—COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen), 10% calf serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Inc.), 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate and transfected as described previously (39Connelly M.A. Klein S.M.

The following day, two 10-cm dishes of transfected cells were trypsinized and resuspended in a total volume of 12 ml with fresh medium, and 0.5 or 1 ml was dispensed to each 22-mm (12-well plate) or 35-mm (6-well plate) well, respectively (one 10-cm dish is equivalent to one 12-well or one 6-well plate). The cells were assayed 48 h post-transfection unless otherwise indicated. Immunoblot Analysis—Transiently transfected cells expressing SR-BI (in 35-mm wells) were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Invitrogen), pH 7.4, and lysed with 300 μl of Nonidet P-40 cell lysis buffer (41Temel R.E.

Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al. (43Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblots with antibodies directed to SR-BI confirmed mutant and wild-type receptor expression. Equal amounts of total cell proteins were separated on precast 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad), blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad), and detected using antibody directed against the C-terminal domain of SR-BI or the respective monoclonal antibody epitope, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody, and SuperSignal West Pico reagent (Pierce). Blots were quantified using a Bio-Rad Model GS-700 imaging densitometer and MultiAnalyst software. Cell-surface Receptor Expression Levels by Flow Cytometry—Transiently transfected COS-7 cells (in 35-mm wells) were washed with 2 ml of cold PBS. Cells were removed from plates by the addition of 1 ml of PBS and 0.5 mm EDTA and incubation for 5–7 min at room temperature. Cells were placed in a microcentrifuge tube, centrifuged at 200 × g for 2–3 min, and resuspended in 100 μl of PBS and 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA). Anti-SR-BI primary antibody 356 at a concentration of 0.48 mg/ml IgG or anti-M45 hybridoma medium at a 1:250 dilution was added to the cells and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The cells were centrifuged at 200 × g for 2–3 min, and the supernatant was aspirated. Cells were washed twice with 0.5 ml of PBS and 1% BSA before incubation with secondary antibody (3 μl of fluorescein- or phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody) in 300 μl of PBS and 1% BSA for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed three times with 0.5 ml of PBS and 1% BSA and fixed in 0.5 ml of 1% formaldehyde in PBS and 1% BSA for 15 min at 4 °C with gently shaking. Following incubation with fixative, the cells were centrifuged at 200 × g for 2–3 min and resuspended in 0.5 ml of PBS and 1% BSA. Fluorescence intensities were measured using a BD Biosciences FACS-Advantage cell sorter or a FACScan flow cytometer. Immunofluorescence—Transiently transfected COS-7 cells were replated 24 h post-transfection onto a 12-well plate containing glass microscope slide coverslips. After 24 h, the medium was removed, and the cells were washed at room temperature with PBS. The cells were fixed for1hin4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in 77 mm PIPES, pH 7.5 (44Berrios M. Conlon K.A. Colflesh D.E. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 307: 55-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar); washed with PBS; and blocked for 1 h with 3% BSA and 10 mm glycine in PBS. Antibody against the extracellular domain of SR-BI was diluted in 3% BSA and applied to cells for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed as described above and incubated with Alexa 488-conjugated secondary antibodies for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were then washed with PBS and mounted using ProLong antifade mounting medium (Molecular Probes, Inc.). Cells were examined using a Leica DMIRE2 confocal microscope, and images were collected using Leica confocal software. Preparation of 125I-Dilactitol Tyramine (DLT)- and [3H]Cholesteryl Oleyl Ether (COE)-labeled HDL and 125I-HDL—Human HDL3 (1.125 g/ml < ρ < 1.210 g/ml), herein referred to as HDL, was isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation (45Havel R.J. Eder H.A. Bragdon J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1955; 34: 1345-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar). The HDL was labeled with [3H]COE (Amersham Biosciences) using recombinant CE transfer protein (Cardiovascular Targets, Inc.) as described (46Francone O.L. Haghpassand M. Bennett J.A. Royer L. McNeish J. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 813-822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications. HDL and CE transfer protein were incubated with [3H]COE (dried down on the glass vial) for 5 h at 37 °C. Labeled particles were reisolated by gel exclusion chromatography on a 25-ml Superose 6 column (Amersham Biosciences). The HDL was then labeled with 125I-DLT as described previously (39Connelly M.A. Klein S.M. Azhar S. Abumrad N.A. Williams D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 41-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Particles were dialyzed against four changes of 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and 1 mm EDTA and stored at 4 °C under argon. The average specific activity of the 125I-DLT- and [3H]COE-labeled HDL was 650 dpm/ng of protein for 125I and 37 dpm/ng of protein for 3H. For some experiments, HDL was labeled using the iodine monochloride method (47Goldstein J. Basu S.K. Brown M. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar), and the average specific activity of the 125I-HDL was ∼500 dpm/ng of protein. HDL Cell Association, Selective COE Uptake, and Apolipoprotein Degradation—Transiently transfected COS-7 cells (in 35-mm wells) were washed once with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 0.5% BSA. 125I-DLT- and [3H]COE-labeled HDL particles were added at a concentration of 10 μg/ml protein (unless otherwise indicated) in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 0.5% BSA. After incubation for 1.5 h at 37 °C, the medium was removed, and the cells were washed three times with PBS and 0.1% BSA, pH 7.4, and one time with PBS, pH 7.4. The cells were lysed with 1.1 ml of 0.1 n NaOH, and the lysate was processed to determine trichloroacetic acidsoluble and -insoluble 125I radioactivity and organic solvent-extractable 3H radioactivity. The values for cell-associated HDL apolipoprotein, total cell-associated HDL COE, and the selective uptake of HDL COE were obtained as described previously (39Connelly M.A. Klein S.M. Azhar S. Abumrad N.A. Williams D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 41-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Cholesterol Efflux Assay—Transiently transfected COS-7 cells were replated onto 11-mm wells in growth medium. Cells were labeled for 24 h with 5 μCi/ml [3H]cholesterol (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% calf serum immediately after reseeding. Cells were washed, and [3H]cholesterol efflux was measured at 2 h in triplicate using different concentrations of HDL acceptor or palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine-containing SUV as described previously (31de la Llera-Moya M.

The release of radioactive cholesterol was measured by scintillation counting of filtered aliquots of acceptor-containing medium and expressed as the fraction of the total 2-propanol-soluble label in the cells plus the label that was released into the medium. Fractional efflux values were corrected for the small amount of radioactivity released in the absence of acceptor. To normalize the data for FC efflux to the amount of cell-surface receptor expressed in the transient transfections, modified HDL cell association assays were performed in parallel with the FC efflux studies. COS-7 cells (in 22-mm wells) were washed once with serum-free minimal essential medium/HEPES and 1% BSA, and monochloride-labeled 125I-HDL was added at 10 or 25 μg of protein/ml of minimal essential medium/HEPES.

They are composed of 24 subunits forming a spherical protein shell encompassing a central iron storage cavity. The iron storage mechanism involves the initial binding and subsequent O2-dependent oxidation of two Fe2+ ions located at sites A and B within the highly conserved dinuclear “ferroxidase center” in individual subunits. Unlike animal ferritins and the heme-containing bacterioferritins, the Escherichia coli ferritin possesses an additional iron-binding site (site C) located on the inner surface of the protein shell close to the ferroxidase center. We report the structures of five E. coli ferritin variants and their Fe3+ and Zn2+ (a redox-stable alternative for Fe2+) derivatives. Single carboxyl ligand replacements in sites A, B, and C gave unique effects on metal binding, which explain the observed changes in Fe2+ oxidation rates. Binding of Fe2+ at both A and B sites is clearly essential for rapid Fe2+ oxidation, and the linking of FeB2+ to FeC2+ enables the oxidation of three Fe2+ ions. The transient binding of Fe2+ at one of three newly observed Zn2+ sites may allow the oxidation of four Fe2+ by one dioxygen molecule.

Living organisms take advantage of the catalytic and redox properties of metals to drive a wide range of vital biological processes. This exploitation of metals is mainly enabled by incorporating them into proteins in various forms. An important class of metal proteins are those that contain dinuclear metal (or dimetal) centers at their active sites (1Andrews S.C. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1998; 40: 281-351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Nordlund P. Dalton H. Eklund H. FEBS Lett. 1992; 307: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 3Barynin V.V. Whittaker M.M.

Schneider G. Shanklin J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4081-4092Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). A common feature of this functionally diverse family is that each dimetal center is embedded in a bundle of four or more helices in a way that enables the binding of dioxygen and/or hydrogen peroxide. With the exception of the dioxygen carrier hemerythrin, in which the metal ligands are found in the motifs HXXXE and HXXXXD, known dimetal centers have either one or two ligand sets within the motif EXXH. Each EXXH motif is located in a separate helix with the Glu residue acting as a bridging ligand between iron atoms, often together with either a second Glu (within a second EXXH motif) or one or more H2O, OH-, or O2- bridging molecules. This organization enables the metals to form a close pair (3–4 Å apart) (3Barynin V.V. Whittaker M.M. Antonyuk S.V. Lamzin V.S. Harrison P.M. Artymiuk P.J. Whittaker J.W.

Variation within this general construction and in the surrounding protein has given rise to molecules with a variety of functions. Most of the known examples of this class of protein have two iron atoms at their dimetal center. Examples include the R2 protein of ribonucleotide reductase (5Logan D.T. Su X-D. Aberg A.

Kurtz D.M. Nordlund P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 539-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Examples of dimanganese proteins include the dimanganese catalase of some lactobacilli and thermophilic bacteria (3Barynin V.V. Whittaker M.M. Antonyuk S.V. Lamzin V.S. Harrison P.M. Artymiuk P.J.

Binding at the di-iron centers of MMO or R2 leads to oxygen activation and results in either the insertion of an oxygen atom into methane (MMO) (6Rosenzweig A.C. Nordlund P. Takahara P.M. Frederick C.A. Lippard S.J. Chem. Biol. 1995; 2: 409-418Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (429) Google Scholar) or the production of a stable catalytically involved tyrosyl radical (R2) (5Logan D.T.

In contrast, hemerythrin binds dioxygen reversibly, whereas the binding of H2O2 to dimanganese catalase results in its catalytic disproportionation to H2O and O2 (3Barynin V.V. Whittaker M.M.

The ferritins are a special class of di-iron proteins that have roles both in iron housekeeping and in iron detoxification (1Andrews S.C. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1998; 40: 281-351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Harrison P.M. Arosio P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 161-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (2258) Google Scholar). Iron is an essential element for almost all organisms. Its ability to form complexes such as heme and the iron-sulfur clusters as well as the di-iron enzymes mentioned above endows cells with a variety of functions. On the other hand, free iron is toxic, due, principally, to its part in generating highly reactive oxy-radicals that can damage cell constituents. To provide a “safe haven,” ferritins store iron as a relatively inert mineral (ferrihydrite-phosphate or hydrous ferric phosphate) “core,” which can be utilized as a source of iron for biosynthesis (1Andrews S.C. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1998; 40: 281-351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Harrison P.M. Arosio P. Biochim. Biophys.

Ferritins are widespread in nature, being found in eubacteria and archaebacteria as well as in eukaryotes (1Andrews S.C. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1998; 40: 281-351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Their molecules are assemblies of 24 structurally equivalent protein chains or subunits related in 432 symmetry and forming a nearly spherical shell (Fig. 1A) with an 80-Å diameter iron storage cavity (7Harrison P.M.

The protein subunits are folded as four helix bundles about 27 Å long with a fifth shorter helix lying at about 60° to the bundle (Fig. 1B). The di-iron centers are situated in the middle of the ferritin subunits (Fig. 1B) and are often known as “ferroxidase centers” because of their ability to confer ferroxidase activity (however, some types of ferritin subunit lack the ability to form di-iron centers) (17Lawson D.M. Artymiuk P.J. Yewdall S.J. Smith J.M.A. Livingstone J.C. Treffry A. Luzzago A. Levi S. Arosio P. Cesareni G. Thomas C.D. Shaw W.V. Harrison P.M. Nature. 1991; 349: 541-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Although ferritins characterized by this overall design are found throughout the living kingdom, the sequence identity between members from diverse species may be as low as 12%, and functional variations have arisen from such differences (1Andrews S.C. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1998; 40: 281-351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Harrison P.M. Hempstead P.D. Artymiuk P.J. Andrews S.C. Metal Ions Biol. Syst. 1998; 35: 435-477PubMed Google Scholar). It is striking that bacteria possess more than one type of ferritin (1Andrews S.C. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1998; 40: 281-351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Many bacteria contain “bacterioferritins,” which differ from classical ferritins in that, in addition to the 24 di-iron centers, they also have up to 12 heme groups per molecule (located on the dyad axes between subunit pairs) (18Frolow F. Kalb A.J. Yariv J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 7: 453-460Crossref Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The function of the heme groups is uncertain, but they may modulate the reductive release of iron from the “core” (19Moore G.R. Kadir F.H.A. Al Massad F. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1992; 47: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli has both a bacterioferritin (EcBfr) and a ferritin (EcFtnA). Both are fully functional iron storage proteins with 24 di-iron centers. E. coli also encodes an uncharacterized ferritin-like protein (EcFtnB) with good sequence identity (33%) to EcFtnA (1Andrews S.C. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1998; 40: 281-351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Harrison P.M. Hempstead P.D. Artymiuk P.J. Andrews S.C. Metal Ions Biol. Syst. 1998; 35: 435-477PubMed Google Scholar). However, its dinuclear center ligands are poorly conserved, suggesting that it probably does not function as a normal ferritin. Several ferritins have been shown to contain more than one type of ferritin chain. In humans, for example, two types of chain, known as H and L, are found to coassemble in proportions that vary with the tissue of origin and body-iron status (10Harrison P.M. Arosio P. Biochim.

Moreover, the iron centers in the animal H ferritins (e.g. from horse and human) are relatively labile and, upon oxidation, the di-iron tends to move into the iron storage cavity, where it becomes “invisible” to X-rays because the mineral-iron core is complexed in a form that is not specifically orientated to the protein structure (11Chasteen N.D.

The corresponding high resolution structures reveal the ligand geometry of the di-iron centers and of a novel, nearby “third” site (Fig. 1C) (13Stillman T.J. Hempstead P.D. Artymiuk P.J. Andrews S.C.

Smith J.M.A. Livingstone J.C. Treffry A. Luzzago A. Levi S. Arosio P. Cesareni G. Thomas C.D. Shaw W.V. Harrison P.M. Nature. 1991; 349: 541-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar) have been determined at medium and high resolution, respectively. In the present study, the structures of five variant EcFtnA molecules and their Fe(III) and Zn(II) derivatives are analyzed. Each variant bears a single substitution (Ala for Glu) in one of the metal ligands. The results provide new insights into the functional behavior of the metal sites in EcFtnA and their relationships to those in other ferritins. Fig. 2 displays schematic representations of the metal centers of EcFtnA, EcBfr, and HuHF. It can be seen that the metal centers of the two E. coli ferritins differ in several respects. First, the di-iron atoms in EcFtnA are bridged by a single carboxylate (Glu50), whereas EcBfr has two bridging carboxylates (Glu51 and Glu127). Second, Glu130, which is a ligand of FeB in EcFtnA, is replaced in EcBfr by His130. Third and most dramatically, EcFtnA has an additional iron site, FeC, not present in EcBfr. Fig. 2 also shows that the di-iron center in HuHF differs from those in both EcFtnA and EcBfr. Like EcFtnA, it has a single bridging carboxyl (Glu62) with a Gln (Gln141) at a position equivalent to that of Gln127 in EcFtnA and the bridging Glu127 of EcBfr. Another difference is the site B ligand, Glu61, which occupies a sequence position differing from those of the Glu130 ligand of EcFtnA or His130 of EcBfr. Note that Glu61 is equivalent in sequence position to one of the site C ligands in EcFtnA (Glu49), but HuHF has no metal in this position because of changes in the carboxylate ligands (Glu129 and Glu130 to Lys143 and Ala144, respectively). Differences in behavior of these three types of ferritin iron center have been described and must reflect the observed variation in structure. The most studied of the mammalian ferritins are horse spleen ferritin, which is a heteropolymer co-assembled from both H and L chains in various proportions, and the single recombinant H or L homopolymers from human, horse, or mouse which have been expressed and assembled separately. When a pair of Fe2+ atoms at the dinuclear centers of HuHF or horse spleen ferritin binds a dioxygen molecule, the two Fe2+ atoms are oxidized to two Fe3+ with the production of H2O2 and the formation of μ-oxo-bridged diferric centers (22Bauminger E.R.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10832-10838Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the diferric centers are quite labile. The ferric atoms can migrate into the storage cavity of the same or even another molecule, where they form ferrihydrite by hydrolytic polymerization (11Chasteen N.D. Harrison P.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 126: 182-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar, 22Bauminger E.R. Harrison P.M. Hechel D. Nowik I. Treffry A. Biochim. Biophys.

When this happens, two processes are possible; the original dinuclear centers can be reutilized, or iron can be oxidized directly on the growing core surface by a 4Fe2+/O2 reaction (11Chasteen N.D.

The function of the L subunit seems to be to provide a site that favors the four-electron reduction of dioxygen. This site consists of clusters of Glu residues located on the L-subunit inner surface and acts as a nucleation center for the formation of mineral, thus stimulating its deposition within the inner cavity (7Harrison P.M.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 432: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In the case of EcBfr, this stoichiometry seems to result from a combination of two processes: the reduction of O2 to H2O2 in an initial di-Fe(II) oxidation, followed by the rapid consumption of the H2O2 thus produced in another di-Fe(II) oxidation, with both reactions giving Fe(III)-O-Fe(III) dimers as their products (29Bou-Abdallah F.

Interestingly, the ferric dimers produced by EcBfr are much less mobile (more stable) than those formed in HuHF. The behavior of EcFtnA differs from that of EcBfr or HuHF. Both kinetic and Mössbauer spectroscopic measurements indicate that Fe(II) atoms at the unique C site are oxidized along with those at the A and B sites, which, as in both EcBfr and HuHF, are linked by μ-oxo-bridges (30Treffry A.

Acta. 2000; 297: 171-180Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). New evidence is presented here for additional metal (Zn2+) sites, which might enable the concerted oxidation of four Fe(II) by one O2 molecule. The structural data also indicate that the presence of Fe3+ at site C stabilizes Fe3+ at the A and B sites such that the tendency of Fe3+ at these sites to migrate into the cavity is decreased. Thus, inactivation of site C converts EcFtnA into a more HuHF-like ferritin. Protein Samples—Site-directed mutagenesis by the pALTER system (Promega, Southampton, UK) and the overproduction and purification of variant EcFtnA derivatives were as described previously (34Treffry A. Zhao Z. Quail M.A. Guest J.R. Harrison P.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 432-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Protein samples were dialyzed against EDTA to remove endogeneous iron. Protein concentrations were determined with the Bio-Rad reagent. Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystals of all five EcFtnA variants were grown at 20 °C by microdialysis against 20 mm piperazine-HCl buffer (pH 5.2) containing 1 mm EDTA and 0.1–0.6 m NaCl. Crystals grew after 1 week, and x-ray analysis showed that they all belonged to the space group I4 with cell parameters a = b = 130.0 ± 0.7 Å, c = 173.0 ± 0.7 Å (for individual cell dimensions, see Tables I and II) and with six subunits in the asymmetric unit. For the metal soaking experiments, crystals were transferred into identical solutions to those in which they had grown except that EDTA was omitted and either ammonium ferrous sulfate or zinc chloride was added to a concentration of 10 mm. Metal soaks were carried out for 3 h before crystal mounting and data collection.Table ICrystallographic data processing Shown are cell dimensions, resolution (Res), number of unique reflections (Refl), internal agreement, completeness (Comp), multiplicity (Mult), and intensity of the 18 data sets analyzed.

https://openalex.org/W2067580449,"In recent years, it has become increasingly evident that angiotensins synthesized in the brain contribute to regulating body fluid homeostasis. Although angiotensinogen, the unique angiotensin precursor, is produced in the brain, the factors that regulate its gene expression remain unknown. We recently found that TTF-1, a homeodomain-containing transcription factor essential for the development of the fetal diencephalon, is postnatally expressed in discrete areas of the hypothalamus. We now report that the subfornical organ, an important site of angiotensinogen synthesis, is an extra-hypothalamic site of TTF-1 expression. Double in situ hybridization histochemistry demonstrated the presence of TTF-1 mRNA in angiotensinogen-producing cells of the rat subfornical organ. RNase protection assays showed that TTF-1 and angiotensinogen mRNA levels are simultaneously increased in the subfornical organ by water deprivation. The angiotensinogen promoter contains seven presumptive TTF-1 binding motifs, four of which are recognized by the TTF-1 homeodomain. In the C6 glioma cell line, TTF-1 transactivates the angiotensinogen promoter in a dose-dependent manner. This transactivation is abolished by deletion of the TTF-1 binding motif at –125. Intracranial administration of an antisense TTF-1 oligodeoxynucleotide decreased angiotensinogen mRNA in the subfornical organ and dramatically reduced the animal's water intake while increasing urine excretion. Moreover, plasma arginine vasopressin content was decreased by the same treatment. These results demonstrate a novel role for TTF-1 in the regulation of body fluid homeostasis, exerted via the transactivational control of angiotensinogen synthesis in the subfornical organ.

The control of body fluid volume and blood pressure is a critical homeostatic process required for normalcy of the internal environment and for the preservation of life. Many studies have demonstrated that the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) 1The abbreviations used are: RAS, renin-angiotensin system; ANG, angiotensin; AoGen, angiotensinogen; AS, antisense; AVP, arginine vasopressin; C/EBP, CCAAT-box/enhancer-binding protein; CVO, circumventricular organ; ODN, oligodeoxynucleotide; PVA, anterior thalamic paraventricular nucleus; SCR, scrambled; SFO, subfornical organ; TTF-1HD, TTF-1 homeodomain; GFAP, glial fibrillary acidic protein; RPA, RNase protection assay; SON, supraoptic nucleus; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay.1The abbreviations used are: RAS, renin-angiotensin system; ANG, angiotensin; AoGen, angiotensinogen; AS, antisense; AVP, arginine vasopressin; C/EBP, CCAAT-box/enhancer-binding protein; CVO, circumventricular organ; ODN, oligodeoxynucleotide; PVA, anterior thalamic paraventricular nucleus; SCR, scrambled; SFO, subfornical organ; TTF-1HD, TTF-1 homeodomain; GFAP, glial fibrillary acidic protein; RPA, RNase protection assay; SON, supraoptic nucleus; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay. plays an important role in the regulation of fluid volume balance, blood pressure, and other related biological responses through the generation of angiotensin II (ANG II) (1Fitzsimons J.T. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 583-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). The existence of a brain RAS in addition to the peripheral RAS has also been established (2Lippoldt A. Paul M. Fuxe K. Ganten D. Clin. Exp. Hypertens. 1995; 17: 251-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 3Unger T. Badoer E. Ganten D. Lang R.E. Retting R. Circulation. 1988; 77: I40-I54PubMed Google Scholar). All components of the peripheral RAS have been found in the brain, most notably in the subfornical organ (SFO). The SFO is a circumventricular organ (CVO) of the lamina terminalis located at the top of the dorsal third ventricle (4Paxinos G. Watson C. The Rat Brain. Academic Press, Inc., New York1998Google Scholar). It is composed of fenestrated capillary loops in addition to glial cells, but in contrast to other CVOs such as the median eminence of the hypothalamus, it also contains neuronal cell bodies (1Fitzsimons J.T. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 583-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar, 5Barth S.W. Gerstberger R. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 64: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The SFO of rats contains high concentrations of angiotensinogen (AoGen) (6Lippoldt A. Bunnenmann B. Iwai N. Mezger R. Inagami T. Fuxe K. Ganten D. Neurosci. Lett. 1993; 150: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), the angiotensin precursor; renin-like activity (that converts AoGen to ANG I) (7Naruse M. Naruse K. McKenzie J.C. Schelling P. Inagami T. Brain Res. 1985; 333: 147-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar); angiotensin-converting enzyme (which converts ANG I to ANG II) (8Pickel V.M. Cham J. Ganten D. J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 2457-2469Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); the peptide ANG II (9Lind R.W. Swanson L.W. Ganten D. Brain Res. 1984; 321: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar); and AT1-type ANG II receptors (3Unger T. Badoer E. Ganten D. Lang R.E. Retting R. Circulation. 1988; 77: I40-I54PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the SFO is not only a target for circulating ANG II, which exerts a potent dipsogenic effect, but also represents a local site of ANG II production, believed to be important in the regulation of body fluid homeostasis (1Fitzsimons J.T. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 583-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar).Given the importance of AoGen in the pathogenesis of ANG II-dependent hypertension (10Jeunemaitre X. Soubrier F. Kotelevtsev Y.V. Lifton R.P. Williams C.S. Charru A. Hunt S.C. Hopkins P.N. Williams R.R. Lalouel J.M. Cell. 1992; 71: 169-180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1709) Google Scholar), it is critically important to acquire a more complete understanding of the mechanisms regulating central AoGen gene expression. The genomic structure of the AoGen gene, including its 5′-flanking region, has been characterized (11Clouston W.M. Evans B.A. Haralambidis J. Richards R.I.

Chem. 1986; 261: 319-323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and recently AoGen-activating elements in the proximal promoter region of the AoGen gene were found to be essential for the regulation of AoGen gene expression in the liver (14Tamura K. Umemura S. Ishii M. Tanimoto K. Murakami K. Fukamizu A. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1370-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and for the AoGen-dependent control of blood pressure by both the liver (15Morishita R. Higaki J. Tomita N. Aoki M. Moriguchi A. Tamura K. Murakami K. Kaneda Y. Ogihara T. Hypertension. 1996; 27: 502-507Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and brain (16Nishii T. Moriguchi A. Morishita R. Yamada K. Nakamura S. Tomita N. Kaneda Y.

Nevertheless, the identity of the binding protein(s) recognized by these AoGen-activating elements remains unknown.Here we report that the homeodomain-containing transcription factor, TTF-1, regulates AoGen gene transcription in the SFO. TTF-1 was first found in the thyroid gland (17Civitareale D. Lonigro R. Sinclair A.J. Di Lauro R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2537-2542Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 18Guazzi S. Price M. De Felice M. Damante G. Mattei M.G. Di Lauro R.

Development. 1991; 113: 1093-1104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we and others reported that TTF-1 remains expressed in discrete regions of the postnatal rat brain (20Lee B.J. Cho G.J.

Kawaguchi A. Inoue K. Sakai T. Dev. Brain Res. 2001; 130: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In the hypothalamus, TTF-1 is present in sets of neurons containing luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone, enkephalin, and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (20Lee B.J. Cho G.J.

Cho G.J. Norgren Jr., R.B. Junier M.P. Hill D.F. Tapia V. Costa M.E. Ojeda S.R. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 107-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). We also showed that TTF-1 binds to specific recognition motifs present in each one of these promoters to regulate transcriptional activity (20Lee B.J. Cho G.J. Norgren Jr., R.B. Junier M.P. Hill D.F.

Because the SFO is a prominent site of AoGen synthesis, we sought to determine whether there is a functional, hierarchical relationship between TTF-1 and AoGen. The results of this study demonstrate that both mRNAs are indeed expressed by the same cells of the SFO, that TTF-1 regulates AoGen transcription via binding to a specific binding motif in the 5′-flanking region of the AoGen gene, and that inhibition of TTF-1 synthesis by antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) administration decreases AoGen synthesis and leads to a decrease in water intake and an increase in urine excretion.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAnimals and Experimental Design—This study was conducted in accordance with the University of Ulsan Regulations for the care and use of experimental animals. Two-month-old male Sprague-Dawley rats (body weight 250–300 g; Daehan Animal Breeding Company, Chungwon, Korea) were used. Upon arrival, they were housed in a room with a conditioned photoperiod (12 h of light/12 h of darkness, lights on from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.) and temperature (23–25 °C) and allowed ad libitum access to tap water and pelleted rat chow. For water deprivation experiments, drinking water was withdrawn for 48 h starting at 10:00 a.m. with food available ad libitum. The animals were sacrificed by decapitation, and their brains were quickly removed for RNA extraction. To dissect the SFO, brains were placed in a brain matrix and sliced midsagittally. The SFO tissue was bilaterally cut with microdissecting scissors according to Paxinos and Watson's atlas (4Paxinos G. Watson C. The Rat Brain. Academic Press, Inc., New York1998Google Scholar) and stored at –80 °C until use. Trunk blood was collected into heparinized tubes for the measurement of plasma osmolality.Double in Situ Hybridization—To localize TTF-1 and AoGen mRNAs in the SFO, the brains of four rats were fixed by transcardiac perfusion of 4% parformaldehyde-borate buffer, pH 9.5, as recommended (23Simmons D.M. Arriza J.L. Swanson L.W. J. Histotechnol. 1989; 12: 169-181Crossref Google Scholar). After an overnight postfixation in the same fixative containing 10% sucrose, the brains were blocked and frozen at –85 °C until use. Thirty-μm sections were then prepared with a freezing sliding microtome and processed for hybridization as reported (24Berg-von der Emde K. Dees W.L. Hiney J.K. Hill D.F. Dissen G.A. Costa M.E. Moholt-Siebert M. Ojeda S.R. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 4223-4237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The hybridization procedure was that recommended by Simmons et al. (23Simmons D.M. Arriza J.L. Swanson L.W. J. Histotechnol. 1989; 12: 169-181Crossref Google Scholar), as described earlier by us (24Berg-von der Emde K. Dees W.L. Hiney J.K. Hill D.F. Dissen G.A. Costa M.E. Moholt-Siebert M. Ojeda S.R. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 4223-4237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), using a [35S]UTP-labeled TTF-1 cRNA probe (20Lee B.J. Cho G.J. Norgren Jr., R.B. Junier M.P. Hill D.F. Tapia V. Costa M.E. Ojeda S.R. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 107-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and a digoxygenin-UTP-labeled AoGen cRNA. The latter was transcribed from a 205-bp AoGen cDNA template generated by PCR amplification (see below for additional details). Following an overnight hybridization at 45 °C, the slides were washed and processed for digoxygenin detection as described (24Berg-von der Emde K. Dees W.L. Hiney J.K. Hill D.F. Dissen G.A. Costa M.E. Moholt-Siebert M. Ojeda S.R. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 4223-4237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After dehydration, the slides were dipped in Ilford K5 emulsion (without defatting) instead of the NTB-2 emulsion used for isotopic hybridization and were exposed to the emulsion for 3 weeks at 4 °C. At this time, the slides were developed, quickly dehydrated, dried, and coverslipped for microscopic examination.Combined Immunohistochemistry-in Situ Hybridization—To determine if TTF-1 is expressed in neurons or glial cells of the SFO, these cell types were identified by immunohistochemistry, and the presence of TTF-1 mRNA was assessed using the [35S]UTP-labeled TTF-1 mRNA described above. Neurons were identified using a monoclonal antibody against NeuN, a neuron-specific nuclear protein (25Mullen R.J. Buck C.R. Smith A.M. Development. 1992; 116: 201-211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This antibody stains the nuclei of most neurons of the central and peripheral nervous system, with the exception of some subsets, such as cerebellar Purkinje cells, olfactory bulb mitral cells, and retinal photoreceptor cells (25Mullen R.J. Buck C.R. Smith A.M. Development. 1992; 116: 201-211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The antibody was purchased from Chemicon (Temecula, CA) and used at a 1:200 dilution. Astroglial cells were visualized with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) obtained from Dako (Carpinteria, CA) and used at a 1:500 dilution. The brains were fixed and sectioned as outlined above and then subjected to immunohistochemistry using a procedure described elsewhere (26Rage F. Lee B.J. Ma Y.J. Ojeda S.R. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 9145-9156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Jung H. Shannon E.M. Fritschy J-M. Ojeda S.R. Brain Res. 1997; 780: 218-229Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar). A modification to the method was the addition of a ribonuclease inhibitor to the immunoreactions. The ribonuclease inhibitor SUPERaseIn (Ambion, Austin, TX) was added (at 100 units/ml) to the solutions containing both the primary and secondary antibodies. Prior detection of ribonuclease activity in the different solutions used for immunohistochemistry using a fluorometric RNase detection assay (RNaseAlert™ Lab Test kit, Ambion) demonstrated that only these two solutions had detectable ribonuclease levels. Upon completion of the immunohistochemical reaction, the sections were mounted on glass slides and were dried overnight in a vacuum oven. The next day they were hybridized with the TTF-1 cRNA. Control sections were incubated with a sense TTF-1 probe transcribed from the same plasmid but linearized on its 3′-end to transcribe the coding strand of TTF-1. Following posthybridization washes, the sections were exposed to NTB-2 emulsion for 3 weeks. At this time, the reaction was developed, and the sections were counterstained with 1% methyl green before microscopic examination.RNA Extraction and RNase Protection Assay (RPA)—RPA was used to quantitate changes in TTF-1 and AoGen mRNA abundance in the SFO and arginine vasopressin (AVP) mRNA in the supraoptic nucleus (SON). Total RNA was isolated as reported (28Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62983) Google Scholar) and subjected to RPA using the procedure previously described by Ma et al. (29Ma Y.J. Dissen G.A. Rage F. Ojeda S.R. Methods. 1996; 10: 273-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) with some modifications (30Kim M.S. Ha C.M. Lee B.J. Brain Res. Protoc. 2001; 7: 277-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The preparation of antisense RNA probes for TTF-1, AoGen, AVP, and cyclophilin followed a procedure described in detail elsewhere (20Lee B.J. Cho G.J. Norgren Jr., R.B. Junier M.P. Hill D.F. Tapia V.

RNA samples (5 μg/tube) or different amounts of in vitro synthesized TTF-1 and AoGen sense RNA (0.06–1 pg/tube) were hybridized with 500,000 cpm of 32P-labeled TTF-1, AoGen, and AVP cRNA probes, respectively, for 18–20 h at 45 °C. The tissue RNA samples were simultaneously hybridized to a cyclophilin cRNA probe (5000 cpm/tube) to correct for procedural losses. At the completion of hybridization, the samples were treated with ribonucleases A and T1 to digest unhybridized RNA species. The protected cRNA fragments were separated on a polyacrylamide-urea gel (5% acrylamide, 7 m urea), and the hybridization signals were detected by exposure of dried gels to X-Omat x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.). The intensity of the signals obtained was quantified as reported (29Ma Y.J. Dissen G.A. Rage F. Ojeda S.R. Methods. 1996; 10: 273-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 30Kim M.S. Ha C.M.

Protoc. 2001; 7: 277-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar).PCR Cloning of an AoGen cDNA Fragment and 5′-Flanking Region of the AoGen Gene—A cDNA fragment of AoGen was cloned by reverse transcription-PCR from rat liver RNA. The specific primer sets (sense primer, 5′-CCT GAA GGC CAC CAT CTT CT-3′; antisense primer, 5′-CAG GGT CTT CTC ATC CAC G-3′) were designed to generate a 205-bp AoGen cDNA fragment corresponding to nucleotides 74–278 in rat AoGen mRNA (NCBI GenBank™ data base, accession number L00091). A rat AVP cDNA fragment was also cloned by reverse transcription-PCR from the rat hypothalamic RNA. The specific primer sets (sense primer, 5′-GCA AGG CTT CTG GCC AGA CT-3′; antisense primer, 5′-CGC CAT GAT GCT CAA CAC TA-3′) were designed to generate a 283-bp AVP cDNA fragment corresponding to nucleotides 26–308 in rat AVP mRNA (NCBI GenBank™ data base, accession number M25646).The proximal promoter of the rat AoGen gene (–689 to +49 bp) to be employed for promoter analysis was also cloned by PCR from rat liver DNA using the sequence information deposited in the NCBI GenBank™ data base (accession number M12113). The sense primer was 5′-GGA TCC ACC CGT CTC ATT CTC-3′, and the antisense primer was 5′-CAA GAG GGC TCT GCT TAC CTT-3′. The resulting DNA fragment was inserted into the luciferase reporter plasmid (pGL-3 basic; Promega, Madison, WI), and its sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Mutant AoGen promoter constructs carrying deletions of the TTF-1 binding motifs were generated using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions; the intended mutations were confirmed by sequencing.Cell Culture and Assays for Luciferase Activity—AoGen promoter analysis was performed in C6 glioma cells, because they endogenously express AoGen (see Supplementary Fig. 1). C6 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Twenty-four h after seeding the cells in six-well plates, they were transiently transfected with the AoGen promoter-luciferase reporter construct (AoGen-P) using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) along with different concentrations (100–500 ng/well) of the expression vector, pcDNA 3.1-zeo (Invitrogen), containing the TTF-1 coding region (TTF-1-pcDNA) (20Lee B.J.

Transfection efficiency was normalized by co-transfecting the β-galactosidase reporter plasmid (pCMV-β-gal; Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) at 20 ng/ml. The transfected cells were harvested 48 h after transfection for luciferase and β-galactosidase assays as reported (20Lee B.J. Cho G.J. Norgren Jr., R.B. Junier M.P. Hill D.F. Tapia V. Costa M.E.

Double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides, labeled with 32P at the 5′ terminus, were used as probes for the EMSA. Sequences of the oligodeoxynucleotides used are shown in Table I. Oligodeoxynucleotides C and Cβ were used as a positive and negative control, respectively (34Pellizzari L. Tell G. Damante G. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 253-262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). EMSA was performed as previously described (22Kim M.S. Hur M.K. Son Y.J. Park J.I. Chun S.Y. D'Elia A.V. Damante G. Cho S. Kim K. Lee B.J. J. Biol.

Electrophoretically separated signals corresponding to the protein-bound and free DNA were quantitated with Multi-analyst software. Binding of TTF-1HD to oligodeoxynucleotides representing different regions of the AoGen promoter was expressed as a percentage of TTF-1HD binding to oligodeoxynucleotide C, which contains the core TTF-1 binding domain and flanking region of the thyroglobulin gene promoter (17Civitareale D.

Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2209) Google Scholar), utilizing the mixture of protease inhibitors recommended by Kuhn et al. (36Kuhn R. Monuki E.S. Lemke G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4642-4650Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The binding assay was performed as previously described (20Lee B.J. Cho G.J. Norgren Jr., R.B. Junier M.P. Hill D.F. Tapia V. Costa M.E. Ojeda S.R. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 107-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), using 15 μg of protein and 20,000 cpm of probe. To further confirm the presence of immunoreactive TTF-1 in the nuclear extracts, the proteins were incubated with 1 μl of undiluted TTF-1 antiserum (NeoMarkers, Fremont, CA) or preimmune serum for 30 min at room temperature before initiating the binding reactions.Intracerebral Administration of Antisense (AS) TTF-1 ODN and Assessment of Water Intake and Urine Output—To determine whether TTF-1 controls AoGen synthesis in vivo and hence has a physiological role in the regulation of water intake and urine excretion, a phosphorothioate AS TTF-1 ODN (GenoTech Corp., Daejeon, Korea) was delivered in the vicinity of the SFO. The AS TTF-1 ODN used to disrupt TTF-1 synthesis (5′-GAC TCA TCG ACA TGA TTC GGC GTC-3′) was directed against the sequence surrounding the first ATG codon of TTF-1 mRNA as previously reported (22Kim M.S. Hur M.K. Son Y.J. Park J.I. Chun S.Y. D'Elia A.V. Damante G. Cho S. Kim K. Lee B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36863-36871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). As a control, a scrambled (SCR) sequence of identical base composition was used (5′-AGT CCT ACT CGG TAC GTA TGC AGC-3′). For the intracerebral injection, the ODNs were diluted to a final concentration of 100 ng/μl artificial cerebrospinal fluid (22Kim M.S. Hur M.K. Son Y.J. Park J.I. Chun S.Y. D'Elia A.V. Damante G.

Under pentobarbital (7.5 mg/kg body weight) and ketamine hydrochloride (25 mg/kg body weight) anesthesia, a polyethylene cannula (outer diameter, 1.05 mm; inner diameter, 0.35 mm) was stereotaxically implanted into the brain with its opening protruding onto the top of the SFO (coordinates: AP = 1.3 mm caudal to the bregma; V = 4.3 mm from the dura mater; L = 0.0 mm from the midsagittal line) as recommended (37Camargo L.A. Saad W.A. Camargo G.P. Brain Res. 2000; 881: 176-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). After a week of recovery, the ODNs (2 nmol in 4 μl of artificial cerebrospinal fluid) were injected with a Hamilton syringe, and water intake, urine excretion, and body weight were measured. One day following a single ODN administration, total RNA or nuclear proteins were extracted from the SFO to determine AoGen mRNA and TTF-1 protein content. To determine the effect of AS TTF-1 ODN on renin-induced water intake, renin (1 milliunit/2 μl) was injected 4 h after AS ODN injection through the same cannula, and water intake was determined for 1 h, beginning 1 h after the renin injection.Western Blot Analysis of TTF-1 Protein—Nuclear protein extracts were prepared according to the method of Andrews and Faller (35Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2209) Google Scholar), and Western blots using TTF-1 antiserum were performed as reported (22Kim M.S. Hur M.K. Son Y.J. Park J.I.

https://openalex.org/W1978226123,"Yeast nucleus-localized thiol peroxidase (nTPx) was characterized as a functional peroxidase. There are two cysteine residues in nTPx. Replacement of Cys-106 or Cys-111 with serine resulted in a complete loss of thioredoxin-linked peroxidase activity. However, when their activities were measured in terms of the ability to inhibit oxidation of glutamine synthetase, C111S showed the same antioxidant activity as the wild type protein. SDS-PAGE gel analysis revealed that only C111S existed as the dimer form. In addition to the identification of Cys-106 as the primary catalytic site, these data suggest the formation of the intradisulfide bond as a part of the catalytic cycle between nTPx and thioredoxin. nTPx preferentially reduced alkyl-hydroperoxides rather than H2O2. Furthermore, a nTPx mutant strain showed higher sensitivity toward alkyl-hydroperoxide than hydrogen peroxide. Also, reduction of the viability of nTPx mutant strain against various oxidants supports an in vivo antioxidant role for nTPx. nTPx transcriptional activity was not significantly detectable in log phase yeast, but the activity was exponentially increased after the diauxic shift. The transcriptional activity was highly induced even in the log phase yeast grown in nonfermentable carbon source. Deletion of Tor1p, Ras1p, and Ras2p resulted in considerable induction when compared with their parent strains, demonstrating the activation of the transcription of nTPx gene at the diauxic shift. Transcription of nTPx gene was induced in response to oxidative stress. Viability of a stationary phase nTPx mutant was considerably reduced compared with the isogenic strain.

Aerobically growing cells are continuously challenged by reactive oxygen species. Reactive oxygen species are potent oxidants capable of damaging all cellular components, including DNA, protein, and membrane lipid. To protect against the toxicity of reactive oxygen species, aerobic organisms are equipped with an array of defense mechanisms (1Halliwell B. Gutterridge J.M.C.

In mammalian tissue, at least six types of TPx isoenzymes have been identified. Recently, in addition to two types of TPx isoenzymes (TSA I, YML028W (2Kim K. Kim I.H. Lee K.Y. Rhee S.G. Stadtman E.R.

Cha M.K. Jeong W. Kim I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5723-5732Google Scholar). Evidence from our recent work indicates that different TPx isoenzymes are localized in distinct cellular organelles, where they are likely to serve diverse functions in yeast cells (22Park S.K. Cha M.K. Jeong W. Kim I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5723-5732Google Scholar). Three novel isoforms showed a thiol peroxidase activity supported by thioredoxin and appeared to be distinctively localized in the cytoplasm, mitochondria, and nucleus. Each isoform was named after its subcellular localization such as cytoplasmic TPx I (cTPx I or TSA I), cTPx II (YDR453C), cTPx III (TSA II/alkyl hydroperoxide reductase 1), mitochondrial TPx (YBL064C), and nuclear TPx (YIL010W) (22Park S.K. Cha M.K. Jeong W. Kim I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5723-5732Google Scholar). Although among the yeast TPx isoforms, the putative nuclear isoform of yeast TPx (nTPx) is a newly reported antioxidant protein localized in the nucleus, there is no evidence supporting in vivo function of nTPx as an antioxidant. In this report, nTPx, a putative yeast member of TSA/AhpC family, was characterized as a functional thiol peroxidase acting as alkyl-hydroperoxide reductase in nucleus during post-diauxic growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Strains and Media—S. cerevisiae strains used in this study were grown in rich medium (YPD; 1% yeast extract, 2% Bactopepton, 2% glucose and YPGE; instead of glucose, 3% glycerol plus 1% ethanol) or in synthetic minimal medium supplemented with the appropriate nutrients. The tor1 mutant strain NH349-3d (MATα, leu2-3,112, ura3-52, rme1, trp1, his4, GAL+, HMLa, tor1::LEU2-4) and its parent stain JK9-3da (MATα leu2-3,112, ura3-52, rme1, trp1, his4, GAL+, HMLa) were kindly provided by Dr. Michael N. Hall (University of Basel, Biozentrum, Switzerland).

Michael Jazwinski (Louisiana State University, New Orleans, LA).

The msn2/4 double mutant strain YM24 (MATα, ade2, can1, leu2, ura3, msn2–3::HIS3, msn4-1::TRP1) and its wild type strain W303-1A were kindly provided by Dr. Michael Jacquet (Universite Paris-Sud, Paris, France). The wild type strain JD7-7C (MATα, ura3-52, leu2, trpA, K+) used in promoter study is our laboratory stock. The null mutant of nTPx was a laboratory stock used in previous work (22Park S.K. Cha M.K. Jeong W. Kim I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5723-5732Google Scholar). Cloning and Mutagenesis of nTPx—The nTPx gene was amplified from yeast genomic DNA by PCR with two pairs of primers covering whole coding sequence. The forward primer has an NdeI site, and the reverse primer has a BamHI site for cloning. The following primers were used for the PCR of the nTPx gene, and enzyme sites are underlined: 5′-CGATCCATATG GGT GAA GCA CTA CGT AG (forward) and 5′-CGCGGATCC TTA TTC TTC TTT AAA CTT TTC AGC G (reverse). The resulting PCR products were cloned into Escherichia coli expression vector pT7-7. For substitution of two cysteine residues of nTPx, PCR-based strategy was employed to introduce nucleotide substitution at defined location (23Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Peese L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 15: 51-59Google Scholar). For replacement of putative functional cysteines of nTPx with serine, the respective cysteine codon was changed to a serine codon. Three mutant proteins (C106S, C111S, and C106S/C111S), in which Cys-106 and Cys-111 were individually replace with serine, were generated by the standard PCR-mediated site-directed mutagenesis with complementary primers containing a 1-base pair mismatch that converts the codon for cysteine to the codon for serine. The mutated PCR products were ligated into pT7-7 digested with NdeI and BamHI. Expression and Purification of Recombinant TPx Proteins—Transformed cells were cultured at 37 °C overnight in LB medium supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and then transferred to fresh medium to the ratio of 1:200. When the optical density of the culture at 600 nm reached 0.4, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to final concentration of 0.5 mm. After induction for 3 h, the cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at –70 °C until use. The frozen cells were suspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 mm EDTA and disrupted. The supernatants after centrifugation at 18,000 rpm using a SS-34 rotor were loaded to a DEAE cellulose column that had been previously equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). The proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl from 0 to 500 mm. The fractions corresponding to the peak of nTPx were pooled and precipitated with 80% ammonium sulfate. The dissolved sample was applied to Sephacryl-100 column that had been previously equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 200 mm NaCl. The purified sample was stored at –70 °C. Chemical Modification of nTPx with N-Ethylmaleimide —The TPx was preincubated in the absence or presence of 1 mm DTT at 30 °C for 30 min, and then chemical modification was carried out in a 100-μl reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2.0 mg/ml nTPx, and 10 mmN-ethylmaleimide at 30 °C for 2 h as previously described. To remove unreacted reagents, the reaction mixture was extensively dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) at 4 °C. Determination of Thiol-dependent Antioxidant Activity—The antioxidant activity was determined by measuring the activity to protect the inactivation of E. coli glutamine synthetase (GS) by a thiol metal-catalyzed oxidation system (DTT/Fe3+/O2) (thiol metal-catalyzed oxidation system) as described previously (4Chae H.J. Kim I.H. Kim K. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16815-16821Google Scholar). The 30-μl reaction mixture containing 100 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.0), 1.0 μg of GS, 3 μm FeCl3, various concentrations of nTPx, and 10 mm DTT was incubated at 37 °C, and then 0.5 ml of γ-glutamyltransferase assay mixture was added. After incubation at 37 °C for 10 min, the remaining activity of GS was determined by measuring the absorbance at 540 nm. Determination of Thioredoxin-linked Peroxidase Activity of nTPx— Peroxidase reaction was performed in a 350-μl of a reaction mixture containing 50 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.0), 0.8 μm thioredoxin, 0.3 μm thioredoxin reductase, 0.26 mm NADPH, varying concentrations of nTPx, and 300 μm of peroxide at room temperature. The peroxidase activity of TPx linked to NADPH oxidation was traced. Construction of nTPx Promoter-β-Galactosidase (lacZ) Fusion—The nTPx promoter-lacZ fusion plasmid was constructed using a PCR-amplified DNA fragment. A putative promoter sequence of nTPx was identified by the analysis with the SGD program (Stanford University). The promoter sequence (positions –345 to –1) was amplified using genomic DNA from a yeast strain (JD7-7C) and a pair of primers (5′-CGGGGTACCTTGTCACTTATTAATGATAAATTATAA and 5′-CGCGGATTCTCTATTAAGGAACTTTAATATTACC). These primers introduce KpnI (forward) and BamHI (reverse) sites (underlined) for in-frame directional cloning into plasmid digested with KpnI and BamHI. To make a β-galactosidase-fused promoter sequences, the lacZ gene was amplified with primers (5′-CGCGGATCCATGACCATGATTACGGATTCACT and 5′-GGTGAAGCTTATATTATTTTTGACACCAGACC), digested with BamHI and HindIII, and cloned into YEGα-HIR525 digested with same enzymes to produce pYLac. The PCR products of nTPx promoter was digested with a KpnI and BamHI and cloned into pYLac digested with KpnI and BamHI to give pYcTPxIIP-lacZ fusion vector. DNA sequencing confirmed that no mutation had been introduced in the promoter during PCR amplification. Long Term Stationary Phase Culture—To test the viability of stationary phase yeast cells, after 72 h of culture in YPD medium, the cells were washed three times and resuspended in sterile distilled water, and incubation at 25 °C with shaking was continued. The cell viability was measured by plating serial dilutions of the yeast cultures on to YPD plates. The colonies formed were counted after 2 days of incubation at 30 °C. The experiments were repeated twice with 10 independent samples. Other Methods—Yeast cells were harvested and disrupted by vortexing with glass beads, and the β-galatosidase activity was assayed using o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactoside essentially as described previously (22Park S.K. Cha M.K. Jeong W. Kim I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5723-5732Google Scholar). The β-galatosidase activity is expressed as unit (increase in A412 nm resulted from o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactoside hydrolyzed by β-galatosidase/10 min/mg of protein). Patch assays were done as described below. Aliquots (10 μl) containing ∼103 or the indicated cell number of an overnight culture were spotted on YPD plates containing oxidants at the indicated concentration. The plates were monitored after 2–5 days of incubation at 30 °C. The protein concentration was determined using a Bradford protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Yeast transformation, DNA, protein extraction from yeast, and other methods not mentioned were carried out according to a supplier manual or the standard protocol described (24Adams A. Gottschling D.E. Kaiser C.A. Stearms T. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis was performed using rabbit polyclonal antibodies against nTPx. Transfer of proteins from 12% SDS-PAGE gels to nitrocellulose and processing of nitrocellulose blots were carried out according to a standard protocol. Northern blot analysis of nTPx mRNA was carried out according to a standard protocol. Yeast total RNA (20 μg) was fractionated in a 1.5% formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred to a nylon membrane, and the resultant blot was hybridized with 32P-labeled nTPx structural gene. Nuclear TPx as a Trx-linked Alkyl-hydroperoxide Thiol Peroxidase—Nuclear TPx contains two cysteine residues (Cys-106 and Cys-111) (22Park S.K. Cha M.K. Jeong W. Kim I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5723-5732Google Scholar). To gain the information about the catalytic cycle of nTPx, each cysteine residue was replaced with serine. The resulting recombinant (C106S, C111S, and C106S/C111S) and wild type proteins were homogeneously purified from the corresponding recombinants (Fig. 1). We determined the antioxidant activity of each recombinant protein in terms of its ability to protect against the inactivation of GS by thiol metal-catalyzed oxidation system (Fig. 2A). In addition to the double-mutated nTPx, the C106S protein also did not show any antioxidant activity. In the presence of the Trx system (Trx, Trx reductase, and NADPH), the peroxidase activities of mutant proteins were also determined indirectly by monitoring the decrease of absorbance at 340 nm (Fig. 2B). In this assay system, in addition to C106S, C111S also did not significantly exert Trx-linked peroxidase activity. The activity analysis of three mutant proteins (C106S, C111S, and C106S/C111S) in two assay systems suggests that the Cys-106 is a primary catalytic site for the antioxidant reaction and that Cys-111 acts as a part of the catalytic cycle between nTPx and Trx via the formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond.Fig. 2Enzymatic analysis of nTPx proteins.A, the antioxidant activity to prevent the inactivation of GS by metal-catalyzed oxidation system. The activity was measured in terms of the ability to protect against the inactivation of GS by the metal-catalyzed oxidation system comprised Fe+3, O2, and DTT. W represents the antioxidant activity of the wild type protein; C1S represents the antioxidant activity of the C106S mutant protein; C2S represents the antioxidant activity of the C111S mutant protein; C12S represents the antioxidant activity of the C106S/C111S double point-mutated protein. B, thioredoxin-linked thiol peroxidase activity of nTPx proteins. C, the substrate specificity of the thioredoxin-linked thiol peroxidase activity of nTPx as a function of protein concentrations. The peroxidase activity was measured in terms of the consumption of NADPH as a function of TPx concentration in the presence of thioredoxin, thioredoxin reductase, NADPH, and 1 mm of peroxides. •, peroxidase activity of TPx toward cumene-hydroperoxide; ○, t-butyl-hydroperoxide; ▪, H2O2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Members of the TSA/AhpC family can be divided into two subgroups, such as one-cysteine and two-cysteine groups according to the number of conserved cysteines within the protein (3Kim I.H. Kim K. Rhee S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6018-6022Google Scholar). The two Cys-containing protein exists as a homodimer via an intermolecular disulfide bond. Previously, we suggested that except for nTPx, all of the yeast TPx isoforms exist as the dimer (22Park S.K. Cha M.K. Jeong W. Kim I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5723-5732Google Scholar). Nuclear TPx was detected at the molecular mass corresponding to that of monomer regardless of the presence or absence of DTT (22Park S.K. Cha M.K. Jeong W. Kim I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5723-5732Google Scholar). Analysis of nTPx mutant proteins on a nonreducing and reducing SDS-PAGE gel showed that in contrast to other mutant and wild type proteins, most of the C111S proteins exist in the dimer form (Fig. 1). The existence of C111S in the dimer form can be taken as an evidence supporting the intramolecular disulfide linkage between two cysteines of nTPx. To confirm the intramolecular disulfide bond, we reacted nTPx with an excessive amount of a thiol-specific modification reagent, N-ethylmaleimide, in the absence or presence of DTT. The treatment of nTPx with N-ethylmaleimide only in the presence of DTT resulted in a considerable loss of antioxidant activity (data not shown), which also indicates that the SH group of the functional Cys-106 forms the disulfide bond with the SH group of Cys-111 during the catalytic cycle of the reduction reaction. Previously, mammalian Prx V (a mammalian TPx) and yeast cTPx III were shown to form an intermediate with an intramolecular disulfide (22Park S.K. Cha M.K. Jeong W. Kim I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5723-5732Google Scholar, 25Rhee S.G. Kang S.W. Chang T.S. Jeong W. Kim K. IUBMB Life. 2001; 52: 35-41Google Scholar). These results, therefore, indicate that nTPx is an atypical two-Cys subgroup member, which forms an intramolecular disulfide as an intermediate (25Rhee S.G. Kang S.W. Chang T.S. Jeong W. Kim K. IUBMB Life. 2001; 52: 35-41Google Scholar). To investigate the substrate specificity of nTPx, we measured the Trx-linked thiol peroxidase activity toward H2O2, t-butyl hydroperoxide, and cumene-hydroperoxide. Fig. 2C showed that among the peroxides as the substrate, cumenehydroperoxide was most rapidly reduced, but H2O2 was not significantly reduced (cumene-hydroperoxide > t-butyl-hydroperoxide » H2O2). The preference of nTPx to alkyl-hydroperoxide as a substrate suggests the in vivo function of nTPx as an alkyl-hydroperoxide reductase. In addition, it is noteworthy that in contrast to other yeast TPx isoforms (22Park S.K. Cha M.K. Jeong W. Kim I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5723-5732Google Scholar), nTPx more easily reduced bulky hydroperoxide such as cumene-hydroperoxide containing benzyl group as the alkyl moiety. The preference for bulky substrate suggests that nTPx may be designed to remove the hydroperoxide linked to bulky groups such as the base groups of DNA. Collectively, these data demonstrate that nTPx is a functional thiol peroxidase exerting alkyl-hydroperoxide reductase activity. Physiology of nTPx Null Mutant Strain—To investigate the in vivo antioxidant function of nTPx, we imposed various oxidants on nTPx null mutant (nTPxΔ) growing aerobically on LB medium containing varying concentrations of 4-NQO. The growth of nTPxΔ was considerably retarded by 4-NQO, a DNA oxidation agent, when compared with the isogenic strain (Fig. 3). To test the viability of nTPx mutant toward oxidative stress, we exposed various oxidants to the mutant. As expected, nTPxΔ was much more sensitive to paraquat, diamide, and 4-NQO than the isogenic strain (Fig. 4). In addition, the sensitivity of nTPxΔ to various peroxides was examined. As shown in Fig. 5, nTPxΔ showed higher sensitivity toward alkyl-hydroperoxide such as t-butyl-hydroperoxide and cumene-hydroperoxide than the wild strain but did not toward H2O2, indicating the in vivo function of nTPx as an alkyl-hydroperoxide reductase. The alkyl-hydroperoxide-specific sensitivity of nTPxΔ can be explained in terms of its alkyl hydroperoxideselective kinetic properties shown in Fig. 2C. Furthermore, the reduction of the viability of nTPxΔ against various oxidants supports an in vivo antioxidant role for nTPx.Fig. 4The sensitivity of nTPx null mutant toward various oxidants. The wild type (W) and null mutants (M) were compared for their ability to grow on YPD plate containing no chemicals as a control (Control), 0.75 mm paraquat (PQ), 1 mm diamide (DA), or 1.0 μm NQO. For each strain, 10 μl of overnight culture diluted to 20, 5, or 1 × 103 cells (from spot 1 to spot 5) were spotted on plates. Growth was monitored after 2–4 days.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 5The sensitivity of the nTPx null mutant toward various peroxides. The wild type (W) and null mutants (M) were compared for their ability to grow on YPD plates containing increasing concentrations of peroxides (H2O2, HOOH; t-butyl-hydroperoxide, tBOOH; cumenehydroperoxide, COOH) (H2O2, 1, 2, and 3 mm; t-butyl-hydroperoxide, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 mm; cumene-hydroperoxide, 0.05. 0.1, and 0.15 mm, from left to right). For each strain, 10 μl of overnight culture diluted to 20, 5, or 1 × 103 cells (from spot 1 to spot 5) were spotted on plates. Growth was monitored after 2–4 days.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Transcription of nTPx Gene Is Turned On at the Diauxic Shift—When the cells are cultured in a liquid-rich medium in which the major carbon source is a fermentable carbohydrate (e.g. YPD), they exhibited two distinct growth phases, followed by a stationary phase in which cells cease to divide. During the first phase, cells meet their energy requirements primarily by fermentation. The second growth phase is initiated when cells exhaust most of the fermentable carbon source, undergo major physiological change, and begin to grow at a much slower rate. The shift between these two phases is called the diauxic shift (a switch from fermentative to oxidative metabolism) (26Boucherie H. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 161: 385-392Google Scholar). Several genes such as HSP26 are transcriptionally induced during the diauxic shift, in which dramatic changes in gene expression occur (27Werner-Washburne M. Broun E. Johnston G.C. Singer R.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 383-401Google Scholar). Therefore, it is necessary to monitor the transcriptional activity of nTPx during growth. To follow a growth-dependent transcription of nTPx gene, we monitored the transcriptional activity of nTPx as function of the growth. Comparison of growth curve before the diauxic shift with their corresponding transcriptional activity (Fig. 6A) indicates that the transcriptional activity of nTPx is not activated in the log phase cells. Therefore, this result suggests the possibility that nTPx gene could be transcriptionally induced during the diauxic shift. To test the possibility, we measured the possible transcriptional activation of nTPx gene upon changing the carbon source from fermentable carbohydrate (i.e. glucose) to nonfermentable carbohydrate (glycerol plus ethanol). As shown in Fig. 6B, the transcriptional activity in the yeast growing on a nonfermentable carbon was about four times higher than that of the yeast on a fermentable carbon when the activities were measured at the mid-log phase growth. Furthermore, the transcriptional activities of Tor1Δ were much higher when compared with those of the isogenic strain (Fig. 6B). Rapamycin forms a complex with FKBP12 that inhibits components of signal transduction pathways, named TOR (target of rapamycin) pathway. The target of the complex was first identified in yeast as the Tor1p and Tor2p (28Heitman J. Movva N.R. Hall M.N. Science. 1991; 253: 905-909Google Scholar). The loss of TOR function at the diauxic shift induces several other physiological changes characteristic of starved cells entering the stationary phase. Inhibition of the TOR signaling pathway by a lack of fermentable carbon induces a set of proteins necessary for the stationary phase yeasts (29Barbet N.C. Shneider U. Helliwell S.B. Stensfield I. Tuite M.F. Hall M.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 25-42Google"
https://openalex.org/W1978585202,"The transcription factor Foxo1 controls the expression of genes involved in fundamental cellular processes. In keeping with its important physiological roles, Foxo1 activity is negatively regulated in response to growth factors and cytokines that activate a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt pathway. PKB/Akt-mediated phosphorylation of Foxo1 has been shown to result in the inhibition of target gene transcription and to trigger the export of Foxo1 from the nucleus, which is generally believed to explain the subsequent decrease of transcription. In the present study, using a chimeric protein in which a C-terminal fragment of Foxo1 (amino acids 208–652) containing the transactivation domain is fused to the yeast Gal4 DNA binding domain, we present evidence showing that insulin can directly regulate transactivation by Foxo1 in H4IIE rat hepatoma cells. Insulin inhibition of Foxo1-(208–652)-stimulated transactivation is mediated by PI 3-kinase but in contrast to full-length Foxo1, does not require either of the two PKB/Akt phosphorylation sites (Ser253 and Ser316) present in the protein fragment. Using mutational and deletion studies, we identify two potential phosphorylation sites, Ser319 and Ser499, as well as a 15-amino acid region located between residues 350 and 364 that are critical for insulin inhibition of transactivation by Foxo1-(208–652). We conclude that the transcriptional activity of Foxo1 is regulated at different levels by insulin: transactivation, as well as DNA binding and nuclear exclusion. These different regulatory mechanisms allow the precise control of transcription of Foxo1 target genes by insulin.

J. 2000; 349: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Members of the FOXO subfamily share several structural features. In addition to the highly conserved central DNA binding forkhead domain (Fox Box), they contain a C-terminal transactivation domain and three consensus phosphorylation sites for the serine/threonine protein kinase B/Akt (34Paradis S. Ruvkun G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2488-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). For example, in Foxo1 used in the present study, these sites are located at Thr24, Ser253, and Ser316 (35Nakae J. Park B.C. Accili D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15982-15985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). In vivo, the activity of these transcription factors is tightly regulated by phosphorylation of their PKB/Akt sites in response to insulin, insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), and other growth factors that activate a PI 3-kinase/phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK-1) pathway leading to PKB/Akt activation. PKB/Akt-mediated phosphorylation of the forkhead proteins was shown to result in inhibition of target gene transcription. Phosphorylation of the PKB/Akt sites also caused the redistribution of the FOXO proteins from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (12Takaishi H. Konishi H. Matsuzaki H. Ono Y. Shirai Y. Saito N. Kitamura T.

A. 1999; 96: 7421-7426Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar). The resulting decrease in nuclear FOXO proteins has been proposed as a possible mechanism for the inhibition of FOXO-stimulated transcription (13Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5380) Google Scholar). The present study was initiated to understand the mechanism of insulin inhibition of transactivation of the IGFBP-1 promoter by Foxo1 and, in particular, to identify the sites in the forkhead protein that are mediating the insulin effect. We have used a fusion protein in which the yeast Gal4 DNA binding domain (1–147) was coupled to a C-terminal fragment of Foxo1 (Foxo1-(208–652)) that includes the transactivation domain and corresponds to the FOXO1 fragment (amino acids 211–655) originally identified in an alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (5Galili N. Davis R.J. Fredericks W.J. Mukhopadhyay S. Rauscher Jr., F. Emanuel B.S. Rovera G. Barr F.G. Nat. Genet. 1993; 5: 230-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). The Foxo1-(208–652) fusion protein was shown to stimulate transcription in an insulin-inhibitable manner (38Tomizawa M. Kumar A. Perrot V. Nakae J. Accili D. Rechler M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7289-7295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that in rat hepatoma cells, insulin inhibition of Foxo1-(208–652)-stimulated promoter activity occurs at the transactivation level rather than by affecting subcellular localization. We show that insulin inhibition is mediated through a PI 3-kinase pathway, but that the two consensus PKB/Akt phosphorylation sites present in the protein are not required. Using mutational and deletion studies, we identify two additional potential phosphorylation sites, Ser319 and Ser499, as well as a 15-amino acid region located between residues 350 and 364 that are critical for insulin inhibition of transactivation by Foxo1-(208–652). Thus, the inhibition of Foxo1 by insulin is complex and involves multiple sites. The direct regulation of the transactivation activity of Foxo1-(208–652) by insulin provides an additional mechanism by which insulin promotes Foxo1 inhibition, thereby regulating the expression of genes controlled by this transcription factor. Materials—Restriction enzymes were purchased from Invitrogen. Taq polymerase was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences-Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). Human recombinant insulin (Humulin U-100 regular) was obtained from Eli Lilly & Co. (Indianapolis, IN). LY294002, PD98059, and SB203580 were purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Cell Lines—H4IIE rat hepatoma cells (39Ooi G.T. Brown D.R. Suh D.S. Tseng L.Y. Rechler M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16664-16672Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were grown as monolayer cultures in low glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT) and antibiotics (50 units/ml of penicillin and 50 μg/ml of streptomycin). Plasmid Constructs—The rat IGFBP-1 promoter-luciferase reporter plasmid (p925GL3) and the expression vector pCMV5/c-Myc-Foxo1, which contains the entire 652 amino acid coding region of Foxo1 were previously described (35Nakae J.

Roberts (NCI, National Institutes of Health), was used as a reporter in Gal4 promoter assays (40Sadowski I. Ptashne M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 7539Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). C-terminal fragments of Foxo1 to be tested were expressed as Gal4 fusion proteins by subcloning the corresponding sequences in a pM2 expression vector (generously provided by Dr. I. Sadowski (University of British Columbia)) encoding the DNA binding domain of the yeast transcription factor Gal4 (40Sadowski I. Ptashne M.

C-terminal fragments of Foxo1, corresponding to amino acids 208–652, 256–652, 317–652, 332–652, 350–652, 365–652, 412–652, 461–652, 476–652, and 501–652 were obtained by PCR using the sense primers, 5′-ATACGTAGATATCAATTCAATTCGCCACAATCTG-3′; 5′-ATACGTAGATATCAACAACAGTAAATTTGCTAAGAGC-3′; 5′-ATACGTAGATATCAATGCTAGTACCATCAGTGGG-3′; 5′-ATACGTAGATATCCAGGATGACCTGGGAGAT-3′; 5′-ATACGTAGATATCGCCAAGATGGCGTCTACG-3′; 5′-ATACGTAGATATCCCAGAAAACATGGAGAAC-3′; 5′-ATACGTAGATATCCCAAACTACTCAAAGTAC-3′; 5′-ATACGTAGATATCGAGTTGTTGACTTCTGAC-3′; 5′-ATACGTAGATATCCCGGTTGATCCCGGAGTG-3′; 5′-ATACGTAGATATCATGCCAGCGTATGGCAGC-3′, respectively, and the antisense primer, 5′-GCTCTAGATTAGCCTGACACCCAGCTGTG-3′. The PCR fragments were digested with BamHI and XbaI and sequentially ligated into the BamHI and XbaI restriction sites of pM2 to generate pM2-Foxo1-(208–652), pM2-Foxo1-(256–652), pM2-Foxo1-(317–652), pM2-Foxo1-(332–652), pM2-Foxo1-(350–652), pM2-Foxo1-(365–652), pM2-Foxo1-(412–652), pM2-Foxo1-(461–652), pM2-Foxo1-(476–652), and pM2-Foxo1-(501–652). Overlap extension PCR was used to generate pM2-Foxo1-(208–652Δ379–460). The fragments corresponding to amino acids 208–378 and 461–652 contained a BamHI restriction site at the 5′-end and an XbaI site at the 3′-end, respectively. Following amplification of each individual fragment, a second PCR was carried out to generate a single fragment containing the deletion. This fragment was then subcloned into the BamHI-XbaI site of pM2. pM2-Foxo1-(208–652Δ350–364) was generated according to the same procedure. In addition, Foxo1-(208–652) and Gal4DBD-Foxo1-(208–652) were ligated into the EcoRI and XbaI sites of a pCEF expression vector containing a GFP epitope tag. Expression vectors encoding wild-type p85α (SRα-p85) and a deletion mutant of p85α (SRα-Δp85) that lacks a binding site for the p110 catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinase, were described previously (42Hara K.

The expression vector encoding FLAG-p300 was a generous gift from Dr. M. Kawabata (Cancer Institute of Japanese Foundation for Cancer and Research, Tokyo, Japan). The sequence of all constructs was confirmed by automated DNA sequencing using a rhodamine fluorescent terminator sequencing kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Site-directed Mutagenesis—Mutations were introduced using a PCR-based method (QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit; Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions. The two consensus PKB/Akt phosphorylation sites (Ser253 and Ser316) in pM2-Foxo1-(208–652) and pM2-Foxo1-(208–652Δ379–460) were mutated to alanine. Ser319/Thr320, Ser322/Ser326/Thr330, Ser354/Thr355/Ser358/Ser360/Ser363, Thr464/Ser465/Ser467/Ser475, and Ser499 were substituted with alanine in pM2-Foxo1-(208–652Δ379–460) and pM2-Foxo1-(208–652/Ser253Ala/Ser316AlaΔ379–460). Ser319 and Ser499, alone or together, were also mutated to alanine in pM2-Foxo1-(208–652) and pCEF-GFP-Foxo1-(208–652). Mutated oligonucleotides used for DNA amplification are available on request. The introduction of mutations was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Transient Transfection—H4IIE cells were transfected as described in previous publications (38Tomizawa M. Kumar A. Perrot V. Nakae J.

Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1227-1237PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were seeded in 60-mm tissue culture dishes at a density of 3 × 106 cells/dish 24 h prior to transfection and were 70–80% confluent at the time of transfection. Transient transfection was carried out with a total of 3–10 μg of DNA using diethylaminoethyl (DEAE)-dextran (Amersham Biosciences). Plasmid DNA (100 μl) was mixed with 100 μl of DEAE dextran stock solution (2 mg/ml in 0.15 m NaCl) previously diluted with an equal volume of Tris-buffered saline (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.7 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.6 mm Na2HPO4) and incubated at room temperature. After 15 min, the mixture was added to each dish, and, 15 min later, 3 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% serum was added, and the incubation continued overnight. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the medium was replaced with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin with or without recombinant human insulin (0.25 μg/ml), and the incubation was continued for 20 h before harvest. In some experiments, transfected cells were preincubated for 30 min with LY294002 (50 μm), a selective inhibitor of PI 3-kinase (45Cheatham B. Vlahos C.J. Cheatham L. Wang L. Blenis J. Kahn C.R. Mol.

Transfection efficiency was monitored by cotransfecting pRSV-β-galactosidase (40 ng) kindly provided by Dr. P. Yen (NIDDK, National Institutes of Health). In each experiment, the total amount of DNA was adjusted by adding empty expression vectors. Luciferase and β-Galactosidase Assays—Cell lysates for luciferase and β-galactosidase assays were prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions (Tropix, PE Applied Biosystems, Bedford, MA) using a Lumat LB 9507 luminometer (EG&G Berthold, Germany). Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured in the same tube using the Dual Light chemiluminescent reporter gene assay kit, allowing 1 h at room temperature for luciferin fluorescence to decay before measuring β-galactosidase activity. Assays were performed in duplicate. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—H4IIE cells were transfected with GFP-tagged Foxo1 208–652 and Foxo1 208–652/Ser253Ala/Ser316Ala using the LipofectAMINE™ Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 48 h, cells were switched to serum-free medium overnight before incubation with recombinant human insulin (0.25 μg/ml) for the indicated times. Lysis was performed using 0.5 ml of lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 0.8 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. Lysates clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, were either directly separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane, and/or first immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antibody (Covance). Western blots were detected using anti-FKHR phospho-Ser253 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) and visualized by chemiluminescence (Pierce). The expression level of Foxo1 constructs was examined by immunoblotting analysis using anti-FKHR antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Nuclei from HEK-293T human embryonic kidney cells transfected with GFP-tagged Foxo1-(208–652) or Foxo1-(208–652/Ser319Ala/Ser499Ala) and FLAG-tagged p300 were prepared using the nuclei EZ prep isolation buffer (Sigma). After immunoprecipitation with anti-GFP antibody, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and probed with anti-FLAG antibody to detect p300 (Covance). Immunofluorescence—H4IIE cells were transiently transfected with the LipofectAMINE™ Plus reagent (Invitrogen) using c-Myc-tagged full-length Foxo1, GFP-tagged Foxo1-(208–652), Gal4DBD/Foxo1-(208–652) or the corresponding empty vector. After 48 h, cells were serum-starved overnight, before incubation with recombinant human insulin (1 μg/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C. Then, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde and mounted with mounting medium from Molecular Probes. Cells transfected with c-Myc-tagged full-length Foxo1, were serum-starved overnight, treated with or without insulin, and fixed as described above, before permeabilization with Triton X-100 and detection with anti-c-Myc antibody (clone 9E10) (Covance) followed by incubation with goat anti-mouse FITC-labeled secondary antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories Inc., West Grove, PA). Cells were visualized using a fluorescence microscope. Insulin Inhibition of Foxo1-(208–652)-stimulated Transactivation Does Not Result from Nuclear Exclusion—The nuclear export of the FOXO proteins was proposed as a mechanism to explain the decrease of transcription of their selected target genes in response to growth factors (13Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5380) Google Scholar). We previously reported that insulin potently inhibits transactivation by a C-terminal fragment of Foxo1, residues 208–652 (38Tomizawa M. Kumar A. Perrot V. Nakae J. Accili D. Rechler M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7289-7295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Here, we examined whether insulin regulates the subcellular localization of Foxo1-(208–652) in H4IIE cells in the same way that it affects the distribution of full-length Foxo1 (residues 1–652). As shown in Fig. 1, in contrast to full-length Foxo1, which was mainly localized to the nucleus in the absence of insulin, GFP-Foxo1-(208–652) was predominantly cytoplasmic in all cells. When insulin was added, we observed, as reported by others (36Nakae J. Barr V. Accili D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 989-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 37Biggs III, W.H. Meisenhelder J. Hunter T. Cavenee W.K. Arden K.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7421-7426Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar), a dramatic redistribution of full-length Foxo1 to the cytoplasm with almost no nuclear staining remaining, whereas the subcellular localization of GFP-Foxo1-(208–652) showed little if any change. Similar results were obtained with GFP-Gal4DBD/Foxo1-(208–652). Thus, unlike full-length Foxo1, changes in the subcellular localization of Foxo1-(208–652) in response to insulin cannot account for the inhibition of transcription observed (38Tomizawa M. Kumar A. Perrot V. Nakae J. Accili D. Rechler M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7289-7295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that inhibition of the C-terminal Foxo1 fragment by insulin occurs at the transactivation level. Insulin Inhibition of Foxo1-(208–652)-stimulated Transactivation Does Not Require the Two Consensus PKB/Akt Phosphorylation Sites—Several studies reported that insulin inhibition of transcription stimulated by full-length Foxo1 requires the phosphorylation of three consensus sites (Thr24, Ser253, and Ser316) by PKB/Akt (11Tang E.D.

Under in vivo conditions, FBPase-Δ60Pho8p was targeted to the vacuole via Vid vesicles, and it exhibited Pep4p- and Vid24p-dependent alkaline phosphatase activation. Vid vesicle-vacuole targeting was reconstituted using Vid vesicles that contained FBPase-Δ60Pho8p. These vesicles were incubated with vacuoles in the presence of cytosol and an ATP-regenerating system. Under in vitro conditions, alkaline phosphatase was also activated in a Pep4p- and Vid24p-dependent manner. The GTPase Ypt7p was identified as an essential component in Vid vesicle-vacuole trafficking. Likewise, a number of v-SNAREs (Ykt6p, Nyv1p, Vti1p) and homotypic fusion vacuole protein sorting complex family members (Vps39p and Vps41p) were required for the proper function of Vid vesicles. In contrast, the t-SNARE Vam3p was a necessary vacuolar component. Vid vesicle-vacuole trafficking exhibits characteristics similar to heterotypic membrane fusion events. The key gluconeogenic enzyme fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) is targeted to Vid vesicles when glucose-starved cells are replenished with glucose.

Lysosomal protein degradation is induced when cultured cells are starved of nutrients or serum. This process recycles amino acids and allows for the synthesis of proteins that are crucial for cell survival during starvation. Several mechanisms are responsible for increased lysosomal degradation during starvation (1Dice J.F. Trends Biochem.

The macroautophagy pathway utilizes autophagosomes to deliver cytosolic proteins and organelles to lysosomes for degradation. The chaperone-mediated autophagy pathway targets cytosolic proteins containing a KFERQ motif for degradation.

Aminopeptidase I is targeted to the vacuole by Cvt vesicles during growth of cells in rich medium. However, when cells are starved of nitrogen, aminopeptidase I is targeted to the vacuole by an autophagosome-mediated process. The Cvt pathway also shares components with the pexophagy pathway that degrades peroxisomes in response to glucose (27Tuttle D.L. Dunn Jr., W.A. J.

The key gluconeogenic enzyme fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) is degraded rapidly when glucose-starved S. cerevisiae are replenished with fresh glucose (31Chiang H.-L. Schekman R. Nature. 1991; 350: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 32Chiang H.-L. Schekman R. Hamamoto S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 3381-3387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). After a glucose shift, FBPase is first targeted into Vid vesicles, and these vesicles then traffic to the vacuole. Vid vesicles appear to be distinct from other types of vesicle (34Huang P.-H. Chiang H.-L. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 803-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Although the origin of Vid vesicles has not been established, their formation requires the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubc1p (36Shieh H.-L. Chen Y. Brown C.R. Chiang H.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10396-10406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The import of FBPase into Vid vesicles has been reconstituted utilizing both a semi-intact cellular assay (35Shieh H.-L. Chiang H.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3381-3387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and an isolated Vid vesicle assay (37Brown C.R. McCann J.A. Chiang H.-L. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 65-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Via these approaches, we have identified several proteins that participate in this first trafficking step. These include the molecular chaperone Ssa2p (37Brown C.R. McCann J.A. Chiang H.-L. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 65-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), cyclophilin A (38Brown C.R. Cui D. Hung G. Chiang H.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48017-48026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and Vid22p (39Brown C.R. McCann J.A. Hung G. Elco C. Chiang H.-L. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 655-666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms for the trafficking of Vid vesicle to the vacuole are less well characterized. Although FBPase delivery to the vacuole has been reconstituted in a semi-intact cellular assay, this assay has not allowed us to identify specific molecules involved in the trafficking of Vid vesicles to the vacuole. To address this issue, we have developed an assay to quantitate the Vid vesicle to vacuole trafficking process. FBPase was fused with a form of alkaline phosphatase that lacks the N-terminal 60 amino acids. Under in vivo conditions, the resultant fusion protein was delivered to the vacuole after a glucose shift, and alkaline phosphatase was activated in a Pep4p- and Vid24p-dependent manner. An in vitro Vid vesicle-vacuole assay was developed which reproduces the activation of alkaline phosphatase, and this activation was also dependent on Pep4p and Vid24p. Using this assay, we have identified the small GTPase Ypt7p as being required for Vid vesicle trafficking. Likewise, members of the SNARE and homotypic fusion vacuole protein sorting (HOPS) families of proteins are necessary components in this step of the FBPase trafficking pathway. Yeast Strains, Plasmids, and Antibodies—S. cerevisiae strains used in this study are listed in Table I. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against FBPase, Vid24p, and CPY were raised by Berkeley Antibody Company (Berkeley, CA) using purified proteins. A pho8::TRP1 knockout plasmid and rabbit alkaline phosphatase polyclonal serum were obtained from Dr. D. Klionsky (University of Michigan). A rabbit polyclonal Ypt7p antiserum and the deletion strains Δvam3, Δvam7, Δvps39, Δvps41, and Δypt7 were obtained from Dr. S. Emr (University of California San Diego). Anti-Vti1p antibody and the Δnyv1 deletion strain were obtained from Dr. T. Stevens (University of Oregon). A rabbit polyclonal Ykt6p antiserum was obtained from Dr. W.

The FBP1 gene was PCR amplified with a forward primer GGTACCATGGGTCCAACTCTAGTAAATGGA and a reverse primer GCGGCCGCCTGTGACTTGCCAATATG. These PCR products were cloned into a pYES2.1 TOPO TA plasmid (Invitrogen), and the orientation of the inserts was confirmed by PCRs. The PHO8 gene was linearized with NotI and XbaI and ligated into NotI and XbaI sites of the FBP1 plasmid. The fusion construct was either transformed into Δfbp1Δpho8 strains or subcloned into an integration vector and integrated into the FBP1 locus. The expression of FBPase-Δ60Pho8p was examined by Western blotting with anti-FBPase antibodies. Similar results were obtained whether the fusion construct was integrated or expressed on a plasmid. The fbp1 deletion construct was produced as described previously (36Shieh H.-L. Chen Y. Brown C.R. Chiang H.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10396-10406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The deletion of fbp1 and pho8 was confirmed by Western blotting with anti-FBPase antibodies and anti-alkaline phosphatase antibodies. To examine the degradation of FBPase-Δ60Pho8p, strains were grown in medium containing low glucose. Cells were shifted to glucose-containing medium for the indicated times, and the levels of FBPase-Δ60Pho8p were determined. To examine the cellular distribution of FBPase-Δ60Pho8p, cell lysates were subjected to differential centrifugation techniques as described previously (37Brown C.R. McCann J.A. Chiang H.-L. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 65-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Briefly, yeast strains (25 ml) were grown in low glucose medium and then shifted to medium containing 2% glucose for 0 and 60 min at 30 °C. Total lysates were subjected to differential centrifugation conditions of 1,000 × g for 10 min, 13,000 × g for 20 min, and 200,000 × g for 2 h. The 200,000 × g pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of SDS sample buffer, whereas the final 200,000 × g supernatant (S200) was precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid, washed three times in ice-cold acetone, and solubilized in 100 μl of SDS sample buffer. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the distribution of FBPase-Δ60Pho8p was determined by Western blotting with anti-FBPase antibodies. Preparation of Vid Vesicles, Vacuoles, and Cytosol—Cells (25 ml) were grown to stationary phase and shifted to glucose for 30 min. Vid vesicles and cytosolic materials were obtained using differential centrifugation techniques described above. The final 200,000 × g pellets (Vid vesicles) and supernatant (cytosol) were aliquoted and frozen at –70 °C until further use. As an additional purification step, the 200,000 × g vesicle-containing material was fractionated further on a 20–50% sucrose density gradient. The location of vesicles within this gradient was verified by electron microscopy. Samples (5 μl) were adsorbed to a Formar-coated grid for 2–3 min. Excess material was blotted away, and the samples were negatively stained with 2% phosphotungstic acid, pH 7.0. The grids were examined using a Phillips TEM400 transmission electron microscope, and micrographs were recorded at a magnification of 46,000. Fractions containing fusion competent vesicles (fractions 3–5) were collected and used in the in vitro assays. Vacuoles were isolated from Δfbp1Δpho8 strains using a protocol described previously (40Vida T. Gerhardt B. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 85-98Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were subjected to glucose starvation and a 30-min glucose shift. Spheroplasts were washed and resuspended in freezing buffer (1.2 m sorbitol, 5 mm HEPES, pH 6.8, 50 mm KOAc, and 5 mm MgOAc) and then stored at –70 °C. Cells were thawed, washed once in freezing buffer, and then broken via passage through a Millipore 3.0-μm filter. Samples were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 20 min and then 13,000 × g for 20 min. The resultant 13,000 × g pellet was resuspended in 75 μl of freezing buffer, and this enriched vacuole material was used for the in vitro assay. For homotypic vacuole fusion experiments, vacuoles were also isolated as described previously (41Haas A. Methods Cell Sci. 1995; 17: 283-294Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by Bio-Rad Dc protein assays. In Vitro Vid Vesicle-Vacuole Assay—In a typical experiment, the reaction mixture (100 μl) contained 20 μg of vesicle material, 20 μg of vacuolar material, 30 μg of cytosolic proteins, and an ATP-regenerating system (0.5 mm ATP, 0.2 mg/ml creatine phosphokinase, and 40 mm creatine phosphate). The reaction mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 60 min, and the reaction was terminated by a 20-min 13,000 × g centrifugation step at 4 °C. The 13,000 × g pellet was resuspended in 500 μl of alkaline phosphatase assay buffer (250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 10 mm MgSO4, and 10 mm ZnSO4) and then examined for alkaline phosphatase activity using 55 mm α-naphthyl phosphate as a substrate. Samples were incubated at 30 °C for 20 min, and the reaction was quenched by the addition of 500 μl of 2 m glycine, pH 11. Alkaline phosphatase activity was measured using a fluorometer (Fluoro IV, Gilford) with an excitation at 345 nm and an emission at 472 nm. Homotypic vacuole fusion experiments were conducted as described previously (41Haas A. Methods Cell Sci. 1995; 17: 283-294Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar). For antibody blocking experiments, various amounts (5–10 μl) of polyclonal antibodies were added to the individual vesicle and vacuole components, and these were then incubated for 30 min at 25 °C. To remove unbound antibody, the Vid vesicles were reisolated using the sucrose gradient protocol described above, whereas vacuoles were reisolated by a 20-min 13,000 × g centrifugation procedure. The antibodytreated components were then mixed with other treated or untreated components and tested in the in vitro assay. Statistical Analysis—Statistical significance was determined using one-way analysis of variance followed by a Student-Newman-Keuls test. Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. * indicates mean values that are significantly different from controls at p < 0.05.

Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 435-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). These assays take advantage of two key characteristics of alkaline phosphatase. First, alkaline phosphatase is translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum and then transported to the Golgi where it is sorted to the vacuole (43Klionsky D.J. Herman P.K. Emr S.D. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 266-292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44Jones E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7963-7966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Darsow T. Katzmann D.J. Cowles C.R. Emr S.D. Mol.

Once inside the vacuole, the C-terminal pro sequence of the protein is cleaved by Pep4p, and alkaline phosphatase is activated. Second, endoplasmic reticulum translocation of alkaline phosphatase is dependent upon the N-terminal 60 amino acids of the protein, and if these amino acids are removed, the resulting Δ60Pho8p remains in the cytosol in an inactive state. FBPase was fused with Δ60Pho8p and expressed in a strain in which the endogenous PHO8 gene was deleted. The 100-kDa fusion protein was recognized by both FBPase- and alkaline phosphatase-specific antibodies, but it was not present in untransformed cells (data not shown). In wild type cells, FBPase is degraded rapidly in the vacuole in a Pep4p- and Vid24p-dependent manner after the addition of glucose. Therefore, we first tested whether FBPase-Δ60Pho8p was directed to the vacuole and degraded in a similar manner. FBPase-Δ60Pho8p was induced by glucose starvation, and cells were then shifted to glucose-containing medium for various periods of time. As is shown in Fig. 1A, the addition of glucose to wild type cells resulted in a significant reduction in the levels of FBPase-Δ60Pho8p over time. In contrast, FBPase-Δ60Pho8p remained at high levels in a Δpep4 strain after a glucose shift. The levels of FBPase-Δ60Pho8p also remained high in the Δvid24 strain, a strain that blocks the trafficking of Vid vesicles to the vacuole (53Chiang M.-C. Chiang H.-L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1347-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Therefore, these results suggest that FBPase-Δ60Pho8p is degraded in a manner similar to the wild type FBPase protein. Our FBPase trafficking model predicts that FBPase-Δ60Pho8p should reside within Vid vesicles prior to its transport to the vacuole. To verify this localization, cells were glucose starved and then subjected to a glucose shift for 0 or 30 min. The distribution of the FBPase-Pho8Δ60p fusion protein in the high speed supernatant (enriched for cytosol) and high speed pellet (enriched for Vid vesicles) was then determined via differential centrifugation and Western blot analysis (Fig. 1B). FBPase-Δ60Pho8p was observed in the high speed supernatant fraction when cells were glucose starved. However, after a 30-min glucose shift, FBPase-Δ60Pho8p was found in the Vid vesicle pellet fraction (Fig. 1B), suggesting that it was transported into Vid vesicles. To examine whether FBPase-Δ60Pho8p is imported into a membrane bound organelle, lysates were treated with 0.8 mg/ml proteinase K for 15 min in the presence or absence of 2% Triton X-100. Proteinase K was inactivated via the addition of 1 ml of 15% w/v trichloroacetic acid, and trichloroacetic acid precipitants were examined for the presence of FBPase-Δ60Pho8p. FBPase-Δ60Pho8p was sensitive to proteinase K digestion when total cell lysates were obtained from cells that were glucose-starved (Fig. 1C). However, FBPase-Δ60Pho8p was resistant to proteinase K digestion when cells were shifted to glucose for 30 min. FBPase-Δ60Pho8p was imported into the lumen of a membrane-bound organelle because FBPase-Δ60Pho8p was degraded by proteinase K when cell lysates were treated with Triton X-100. If the FBPase-Δ60Pho8p fusion protein behaves in a manner similar to FBPase, it should remain in the cytosol during periods of glucose starvation and not exhibit alkaline phosphatase activity. However, after the addition of fresh glucose, FBPase-Δ60Pho8p should be targeted to the vacuole, and alkaline phosphatase should be activated by Pep4p. Wild type, Δpep4, and Δvid24 strains were transformed to express FBPase-Δ60Pho8p. These strains were shifted to glucose, and the activation of alkaline phosphatase was measured (Fig. 1D). When wild type cells were maintained in low glucose medium, alkaline phosphatase was not activated. However, when these cells were shifted to glucose-containing medium for 3 h, alkaline phosphatase activity increased. Therefore, FBPase was able to direct Δ60Pho8p to the vacuole where it was enzymatically activated. In contrast, alkaline phosphatase activity was low when either the Δpep4 or Δvid24 strain was shifted to glucose for 3 h. These results further confirm that FBPase-Δ60Pho8p is targeted to the vacuole by the Vid vesicle-mediated pathway. Autophagic processes often result in the nonselective transport of cytosolic proteins to the vacuole for degradation (23Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). To determine whether FBPase-Δ60Pho8p could be targeted to vacuoles via the autophagy pathway, we subjected cells to a period of nitrogen starvation and then examined for the activation of alkaline phosphatase. A wild type strain expressing Δ60Pho8p was used as a control because Δ60Pho8p is targeted to the vacuole via the autophagy pathway after nitrogen starvation (13Mizushima N. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3888-3896Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 15Shintani T. Mizushima N. Ogawa Y. Matsuura A. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5234-5241Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). As expected, low levels of alkaline phosphatase activity were observed when the Δ60Pho8p strain was grown under normal conditions. However, a high level of alkaline phosphatase activity was observed when these same cells were subjected to nitrogen starvation (Fig. 1E). In contrast, when FBPase was fused with Δ60Pho8p, alkaline phosphatase activity was low either before or after nitrogen starvation. Therefore, it appears that the FBPase-Δ60Pho8p fusion protein is targeted to the vacuole via the Vid-dependent pathway, but not via the autophagy pathway.

https://openalex.org/W2090379208,"COX-2 is overexpressed in cancer cells and has become a major target for cancer preventive drugs. NSAIDs, retinoids, antioxidants, and PPAR agonists, reported to be chemopreventive, suppress COX-2 synthesis. NSAIDs also have been shown to be chemopreventive independent of COX-2 activity. Common to all of these compounds is their ability to release arachidonic acid (AA) from rat liver cells in culture. Most of these compounds inhibit induced PGI2 production. Vitamin D3 and tamoxifen, however, not only stimulate the release of AA from cells: they amplify rather than inhibits induced COX activity. In view of the many activities attributable to AA, I propose that its release and accumulation could initiate molecular reactions that lead to apoptosis and eventually to suppression of cancer. Some drugs shown to release AA from cells and affect PGI2 production-e.g., thiazolidinediones and statins are widely used for conditions unrelated to cancer. In vivo studies could reveal whether they can also function as cancer preventive agents."

Understanding the conformation of an enzyme in solution is an essential aspect of the comprehensive characterization of the overall structure and function of that enzyme. Taq DNA polymerase is a single polypeptide chain consisting of three structure/function domains: a polymerase domain, a 3′ exonuclease domain (inactive in Taq), and a 5′ nuclease domain (1Chien A.

Gene (Amst.). 1992; 112: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) (by analogy to the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli). The spatial positioning of the 5′ nuclease domain of Taq DNA polymerase has been the subject of debate, and crystal structures of the full-length protein have been reported with the 5′ nuclease domain in two different positions relative to the Klentaq domain (5Kim Y Eom S.H. Wang J. Lee D.S. Suh S.W. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 612-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 7Eom S.H. Wang J. Steitz T.A.

Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1971-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The two structures are shown in Fig. 1. In one structure, the 5′ nuclease domain extends directly out into solution, whereas in the other, this domain is folded up against the Klentaq domain.The two reported conformations for Taq polymerase have potentially different functional consequences. In the elongated conformation of the polymerase, the polymerization and 5′ nuclease active sites are separated by ∼70 Å (5Kim Y Eom S.H. Wang J. Lee D.S. Suh S.W. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 612-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 8Urs U.K. Murali R. Krishna Murthy H.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1971-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In order for a single polymerase molecule to simultaneously catalyze nucleotide incorporation and 5′ nuclease activities in close proximity on the same piece of DNA, the polymerase would need to adopt a more compact conformation that would bring the two active sites into relative proximity (8Urs U.K. Murali R. Krishna Murthy H.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1971-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Although the compact conformation observed in the Urs et al. crystal structure is not ideally oriented for such simultaneous catalysis, the two active sites are in closer proximity than in the extended structure (8Urs U.K. Murali R. Krishna Murthy H.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1971-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The larger separation between active sites in the elongated conformation of the polymerase does not preclude binding of the same DNA to the two active sites; however, it would involve more distant spacing along the DNA between the two active sites. It is also certainly possible that under certain conditions, the polymerase can switch between elongated and compact conformations.Analytical ultracentrifugation and small angle x-ray scattering provide different but complementary information on the size and shape of macromolecules in solution. The structural information provided by these techniques is quite “low resolution,” but for large proteins, where NMR methods are only in their infancy, these techniques often provide some of the only solution structural information about a protein. In this study, we have characterized basic hydrodynamic properties (s 20,w and partial specific volume) and x-ray scattering properties (radius of gyration) of full-length Taq and E. coli Pol 1 1The abbreviations used are: Pol 1, E. coli Type 1 DNA polymerase; SAXS, small angle x-ray scattering; PDB, Protein Data Bank; SSRL, Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Research Laboratory; R S, Stokes radius; R g, radius of gyration.1The abbreviations used are: Pol 1, E. coli Type 1 DNA polymerase; SAXS, small angle x-ray scattering; PDB, Protein Data Bank; SSRL, Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Research Laboratory; R S, Stokes radius; R g, radius of gyration. DNA polymerases and their Klentaq and Klenow subfragments. We have also performed structure-based calculations of these same parameters using software developed by Garcia de la Torre et al. (for hydrodynamic parameters) (9Garcia De La Torre J Huertas M.L Carrasco B. Biophys J. 2000; 78: 719-730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar) and by Svergun et al. (for x-ray scattering parameters) (10Svergun D.I. Barberato C. Koch M.H.J. J. Appl. Crystalogr. 1995; 28: 768-773Crossref Scopus (2718) Google Scholar). In addition to presenting the basic hydrodynamic and x-ray scattering properties of these proteins, we show that the data indicate that in the absence of DNA, both full-length Taq and full-length Pol 1 are in an elongated conformation in solution with their 5′ nuclease domains sticking out into solution. Additionally, when bound to a matched primer template piece of DNA or to ddATP, Taq polymerase remains in an elongated conformation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Polymerases were expressed and purified as described previously (11Minkley Jr., E.G.

Chem. 2003; 278: 5694-5701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). No surfactants were used during purification, experiments, or storage of the polymerases. Taq and Klentaq polymerases were stored at 4 °C before use. Pol 1 and Klenow polymerases were stored frozen at –20 °C (13Joyce C.M. Derbyshire V. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 3-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The DNA used for small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements of the Taq + DNA complex was a matched 13-/20-mer primer template pair with the sequence: 5′-TCGCAGCCGTCCA-3′ paired with 3′-AGCGTCGGCAGGTTCCCAAA-5′ as used previously for Taq polymerase DNA binding studies (12Datta K. LiCata V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5694-5701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).Sedimentation Coefficient Measurements—Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed in a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical Ultracentrifuge. Sedimentation coefficients were measured at 20 °C in KD buffer (10 mm Tris, 125 mm KCl, and 5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.9). The reference and sample sectors of Epon charcoal-filled double-sector cells were loaded with 425 μl of buffer and 400 μl of protein solution, respectively. All velocity runs were performed at 38,000 rpm in an An-60 Ti rotor for 3.5 h. The absorbance was monitored at 280 nm. Twenty absorbance scans with a 0.004-cm step size were recorded at 10-min intervals. Svedberg constants were determined from fits of the data to single ideal species using the program Svedberg (14Philo J. Schuster T.M. Laue T.M. Modern Analytical Ultracentrifugation. Birkhauser, Boston1994: 156-170Crossref Google Scholar, 15Philo J. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 435-444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). All data were well fit by a single ideal species model across a range of concentrations. Taq concentrations examined ranged from 0.25 to 1.0 mg/ml. Klentaq concentrations examined ranged from 0.3 to 1.23 mg/ml. Klenow concentrations examined ranged from 0.36 to 1.25 mg/ml. Pol 1 was examined at 0.2 mg/ml only. All s values reported herein have been converted to s 20,w values using measured solvent densities and viscosities.Sedimentation Equilibrium Experiments and Partial Specific Volume Determination—The partial specific volumes of the polymerases were measured using the method of Edelstein and Schachman (16Edelstein S.J. Schachman H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 306-311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed either in H2O/KD buffer or in 96% D2O/KD buffer. Experiments were performed in the Beckman Optima XL-A using the same rotor and cells used in the sedimentation velocity runs. The double sector cells were loaded with 125 μl of buffer and 110 μl of protein solution in matching buffer. Equilibrium runs were performed at 9500 rpm for Pol 1 and Taq and 11,000 rpm for Klenow and Klentaq. All runs were carried out at 20 °C for ∼24 h or until equilibrium was reached. The absorbance was monitored at 280 nm, and the initial absorbance of each protein solution was between 0.1 and 0.6. Equilibrium data were analyzed using the Origin Equilibrium analysis package provided with the instrument. The partial specific volume of each polymerase in KD buffer at 20 °C was also calculated from the amino acid sequence using the computer program SEDNTERP (freeware, archived at www.bbri.org/rasmb/rasmb.html).Density and Viscosity Measurements—Buffer density was measured at 20 °C using an Anton-Paar DMA 58 digital densitometer. A calibrated Cannon-Manning semimicro kinematic viscometer was used to measure the buffer viscosity. The measured efflux time was converted to viscosity using the equation, viscosity = t*V*ρ, where t = efflux time, V = viscometer constant (in mm2s2) at temperature T (as supplied by the manufacturer), and ρ = buffer density.Small Angle X-ray Scattering—SAXS experiments were conducted on synchrotron beamlines 1-4 and 4-2 at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Research Laboratory (SSRL). Preliminary data were also collected on beamline D11A-SAXS at the Laboratorio Nacional de Luz Sincrotron (LNLS) in Campinas, Brazil. All data shown in the manuscript are from the SSRL beamlines. Data from SSRL beamline 4-2 were collected at a wavelength of 1.385 Å and sample to detector distances of 1.28 and 2.0 m. Data from SSRL beamline 1-4 were collected at a wavelength of 1.488 Å and a sample to detector distance of 0.38 m (which is optimal for this beamline). The beam flux was 2 × 1010 photons/s. The sample cell was aluminum and consisted of a 200-μl flat sided, round sample chamber. The path length through the sample was 1.4 mm and was bounded on both sides by circular Kapton windows. SAXS measurements were conducted for all four polymerases in KD buffer. Scattering was monitored in 15-min exposure times for each polymerase. Repeated measurements of the same sample yielded the same results, indicating that no significant radiation damage occurred during the experiments. Polymerase concentrations ranged from 0.9 to 5.3 mg/ml, and at least three different concentrations were examined for each protein. Determined R g values did not show any protein concentration dependence within error. The scattering data were collected and normalized for dark counts and scattering intensity, and the buffer background scattering was subtracted using the resident analysis programs at each beamline.SAXS experiments were conducted at very low protein concentrations for this technique. This was due to precipitation of the polymerases at higher concentrations. For example, full-length Taq polymerase will sometimes begin to precipitate at concentrations above 1.5 mg/ml. Lower protein concentrations lead to higher noise levels in the data and generally preclude detailed shape analysis of the data at higher q values. SAXS data were analyzed in three major ways: 1) The data were analyzed using Guinier plots (17Guinier A. Ann. Phys. 1939; 12: 161-167Crossref Google Scholar) where R g values were determined from the linear portions of the plots. 2) The data were analyzed using the program GNOM, where an indirect Fourier transform of the experimental scattering curve is implemented to derive the P(r) distance distribution function. The R g is then calculated from the P(r) function (18Semenyuk A.V. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Cryst. 1991; 24: 537-540Crossref Scopus (566) Google Scholar). Program default values were used for all input parameters except for D max, which is altered to obtain the best fit (18Semenyuk A.V. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Cryst. 1991; 24: 537-540Crossref Scopus (566) Google Scholar). 3) The data were analyzed using the program CRYSOL, which fits the measured scattering curve with a simulated scattering curve generated using a known x-ray crystal structure (10Svergun D.I. Barberato C. Koch M.H.J. J. Appl. Crystalogr. 1995; 28: 768-773Crossref Scopus (2718) Google Scholar). Some, but not all, of the scattering curves exhibited a sharp increased slope at very low q values (q < 0.02 Å–1), which was removed before analysis. This behavior was only present in some of the beamline configurations used and seemed to be best explained as a beam stop problem (for example, none of the data shown in Figs. 5, 6, 7 exhibited this behavior). This behavior could not be attributed to aggregation since 1) it was sometimes absent; 2) it was generally identical from protein to protein, including control proteins such as aspartate transcarbamylase (data not shown); and 3) it was not correlated with the protein concentration. Furthermore, the equilibrium centrifugation experiments also conducted in this study showed no appreciable aggregation of the protein.Fig. 5Guinier plots (17Guinier A. Ann.

Open circles show the data for full-length Taq, open triangles show data for Klentaq, diamonds show data for Klenow, and open squares show data for E. coli Pol 1. Pol 1 shows considerable curvature in the Guinier plot and so was not analyzed for an R g value. The fitted lines used to determine the R g values for Taq, Klentaq, and Klenow reported in Table II are shown. Protein concentrations are 5.1 mg/ml for Taq, 3.8 mg/ml for Klentaq, 6.3 mg/ml for E. coli Pol 1, and 5.3 mg/ml for Klenow. The data for Klentaq and Klenow are in the original ln (intensity) units.

For HYDROPRO, the PDB file, molecular weight, solution density and viscosity, protein partial specific volume, temperature, atomic element radius (AER), and σ values are the HYDROPRO input parameters (9Garcia De La Torre J Huertas M.L Carrasco B. Biophys J. 2000; 78: 719-730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). Hydration of the protein is one of the components contributing to the AER parameter in HYDROPRO. Atomic coordinates for all heteroatoms were deleted from each PDB coordinate file. To ensure that calculated differences between the two conformations of Taq polymerase were not due to different numbers of atoms missing in the two different structures, files were also generated that contained equal numbers of atoms: atomic coordinates missing from 1TAQ were deleted from 1CMW and vice versa. These deletions did not significantly alter the calculated values. Hydrodynamic and other solution properties were computed for each structure file using an AER value of 3 to construct the primary hydrodynamic particle and six σ values in a range selected to vary the number of beads in the model from ∼200 to ∼2000. These values are in the parameter ranges suggested by Garcia de la Torre et al. (9Garcia De La Torre J Huertas M.L Carrasco B.

Program default values were used for all parameters except the scattering q maximum, which was set to coincide with the q maximum of the experimental data sets. The program calculates the theoretical scattering curve from crystal structure coordinates and then alters the volume and hydration contrast parameters to obtain the best fit to the experimental scattering curve. Several crystal structures for Klenow polymerase exist in various functional states. Conformational variations among the different states for Klenow are not significant enough to be easily detectable by SAXS, and CRYSOL calculations with different Klenow structures yield equivalent results (data not shown). Rigid body rotations of the position of the 5′ nuclease domain of Taq relative to the Klentaq domain were performed using the program Insight II (Accelrys, Inc.).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONSedimentation Coefficients—Sedimentation coefficients were measured for all four polymerases: Taq, Klentaq, E. coli Pol 1, and Klenow. Measurements were made at 20 °C and were corrected to s 20,w values using measured solvent densities and viscosities. Fig. 2 shows representative sedimentation velocity data for Taq polymerase. Values of s 20,w were also calculated from crystal structures using the program HYDROPRO from the laboratory of Garcia de la Torre (9Garcia De La Torre J Huertas M.L Carrasco B.

This program uses shell modeling algorithms to predict hydrodynamic properties directly from a PDB file.

The more compact form of the protein would sediment faster than the more elongated form, and its calculated s 20,w is thus larger than that of the elongated form. Fig. 3A graphically illustrates the relationships between the measured and calculated data. The measured and calculated s 20,w values agree well for Klentaq and Klenow polymerases and for the elongated form of full-length Taq. The measured s 20,w value for full-length Taq deviates from the s 20,w calculated for the elongated crystal structure by 1.6% and deviates from the s 20,w calculated for the compact crystal structure by 5.1%. This is a small difference, but it is well outside experimental error, and its significance can be illustrated by noting that the classic T to R conformational transition for aspartate transcarbamylase (ATCase) is associated with a 3.6% change in its measured s 20,w value (21Kirschner M.W. Schachman H.K. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 1900-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The deviations between the measured and calculated s 20,w values for Klentaq and Klenow are 1.7 and 1.1%, respectively. It is also notable that the measured s 20,w value for full-length E. coli Pol 1 is also smaller than the calculated s 20,w for the compact conformation of Taq. Since E. coli Pol 1 is ∼9 kDa larger than Taq, this further supports the interpretation that Taq is in the elongated conformation. Further, it argues that E. coli Pol 1 is also not in a compact conformation.Fig. 3Plots of sedimentation coefficients (s 20,w values) versus molecular weight for each of the four polymerases. A shows s 20,w values plotted directly against protein molecular sizes. Open circles show the experimental values for each of the polymerases.

https://openalex.org/W1992535006,"The small GTPase Ran/Gsp1p plays an essential role in nuclear trafficking of macromolecules, as Ran/Gsp1p regulates many transport processes across the nuclear pore complex (NPC). To determine the role of nucleoporins in the generation of the nucleocytoplasmic Gsp1p concentration gradient, mutations in various nucleoporin genes were analyzed in the yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae.</i> We show that the nucleoporins Nup133p, Rat2p/Nup120p, Nup85p, Nic96p, and the enzyme acetyl-CoA carboxylase (<i>MTR7</i>) control the distribution and cellular concentration of Gsp1p. At the restrictive temperature the reporter protein GFP-Gsp1p, which is too large to diffuse across the nuclear envelope, fails to concentrate in nuclei of <i>nup133</i>Δ<i>, rat2-1, nup85</i>Δ<i>, nic96</i>Δ<i>C,</i> and <i>mtr7-1</i> cells, demonstrating that GFP-Gsp1p nuclear import is deficient. In addition, the concentration of Gsp1p is severely reduced in mutants <i>nup133</i>Δ and <i>mtr7-1</i> under these conditions. We have now identified the molecular mechanisms that contribute to the dissipation of the Gsp1p concentration gradient in these mutants. Loss of the Gsp1p gradient in <i>nup133</i>Δ and <i>rat2-1</i> can be explained by reduced binding of the Gsp1p nuclear carrier Ntf2p to NPCs. Likewise, <i>nup85</i>Δ cells that mislocalize GFP-Gsp1p at the permissive as well as non-permissive temperature have a diminished association of Ntf2p-GFP with nuclear envelopes under both conditions. Moreover, under restrictive conditions Prp20p, the guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Gsp1p, mislocalizes to the cytoplasm in <i>nup85</i>Δ<i>, nic96</i>Δ<i>C</i>, and <i>mtr7-1</i> cells, thereby contributing to a collapse of the Gsp1p gradient. Taken together, components of the NPC subcomplex containing Rat2p/Nup120p, Nup133p, and Nup85p, in addition to proteins Nic96p and Mtr7p, are shown to be crucial for the formation of a nucleocytoplasmic Gsp1p gradient."
https://openalex.org/W2015646332,"A consensus sequence present in the 5′- or 3′-untranslated regions of several Crithidia fasciculata messenger RNAs encoding proteins involved in DNA metabolism has been shown to be necessary for the periodic accumulation of these mRNAs during the cell cycle. A protein complex termed cycling sequence-binding protein (CSBP) has two subunits, CSBPA and CSBPB, and binds the consensus sequence with high specificity. The binding activity of CSBP was shown to vary during the cell cycle in parallel with the levels of putative target mRNAs. Although disruption of the CSBPA gene resulted in loss of both CSBPA and CSBPB, the putative target message levels still continued to vary during the cell cycle. The presence of an additional and distinct binding activity was revealed in these CSBPA null mutant cells. This activity, termed CSBP II, was also expressed in wild-type Crithidia cells. CSBP II has higher binding specificity for the cycling sequence element than the earlier described CSBP complex. Three polypeptides associated with purified CSBP II show specific binding to the cycling sequence.

Trypanosomes contain a novel mitochondrial DNA network termed kinetoplast DNA consisting of thousands of minicircle DNA molecules and a small number of maxicircle DNA molecules interlocked to form a huge catenated structure (1Simpson L. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1987; 41: 363-382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Kinetoplast DNA replication occurs through a unique process in which the minicircles are released from the network for replication, and the newly replicated minicircles still containing nicks and gaps are reattached to the network periphery (for recent reviews see Refs. 2Berberof M. Vanhamme L. Tebabi P. Pays A. Jefferies D. Welburn S. Pays E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2925-2934Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar and 3Bates E.J. Knuepfer E. Smith D.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1211-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, the maxicircles replicate while remaining attached to the network. Unlike in higher eukaryotes where mitochondrial DNA replication occurs throughout the cell cycle, kinetoplast DNA replication in trypanosomes occurs in apparent synchrony with nuclear DNA replication (4Cosgrove W.B. Skeen M.J. J. Protozool. 1970; 17: 172-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Studies have been undertaken to understand the possible role that cell cycle-dependent coordinated expression of DNA replication genes may play in coordinating nuclear and kinetoplast DNA replication. Regulation of gene expression in trypanosomatids is predominantly post-transcriptional (reviewed in Ref. 5Vanhamme L. Pays E. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 223-240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Polycistronic messages are generated through constitutive transcription of protein-coding genes by RNA polymerase II, which then undergo 5′-trans-splicing and 3′-polyadenylation to produce the mature mRNA. Multiple points of regulation controlling expression of specific transcripts have been investigated. Cis-acting factors that affect mRNA stability have been identified within the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) 1The abbreviations used are: UTR, untranslated region; RPA, replication protein A; DHFR-TS, dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase; TOP, topoisomerase; CSBP, cycling sequence-binding protein; DTT, dithiothreitol; BSA, bovine serum albumin. of specific transcripts. AU-rich cis-regulatory elements present in the 3′-UTR have been shown to regulate the stability of transcripts of procyclic acidic repetitive proteins (EP and GPEET) or procyclins (6Wilson K.

Homologs of the poly(A)-binding protein 1 have been cloned from T. brucei (14Hotchkiss T.L. Nerantzakis G.E. Dills S.C. Shang L. Read L.K. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 98: 117-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and Leishmania major (3Bates E.J. Knuepfer E. Smith D.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1211-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In higher eukaryotes, the poly(A)-binding protein 1 binding to the poly(A) tail of matured transcripts has been shown to enhance message stability. Crithidia fasciculata, a member of the family trypanosomatidae that includes many human pathogens like T. brucei causing sleeping sickness and the Leishmania parasites causing a range of disease forms including the fatal visceral leishmaniasis, is infective to insect cells. Most biochemical studies of kinetoplast DNA replication have been carried out in Crithidia as it can be easily grown in large scale cultures that can also be synchronized by hydroxyurea treatment. In synchronized cultures, the transcript levels of the genes encoding the large and middle subunits of the nuclear protein RPA (RPA1 and RPA2, a homolog of the human replication protein A), dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase (DHFR-TS), the kinetoplast-specific topoisomerase II (TOP2), and the histone-like kinetoplast-associated protein 3 have been shown to cycle in parallel, reaching maximum levels during the late G1 and S phases and then declining rapidly during the G2 and M phases (15Pasion S.G. Brown G.W. Brown L.M. Ray D.S. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3515-3520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transcripts of these genes were found to possess one or more copies of a consensus octameric sequence (C/A)AUAGAA(G/A) with a highly conserved hexameric core in either their 5′- or 3′-UTR (16Pasion S.G. Hines J.C. Ou X. Mahmood R. Ray D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6724-6735Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 17Brown L.M. Ray D.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3281-3289Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The sequence has been proposed to have a destabilizing role as mutations in the octamer sequence lead to accumulation of the messages to the highest level (16Pasion S.G. Hines J.C. Ou X. Mahmood R. Ray D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6724-6735Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Introduction of six copies of the octamer sequence (6× octamer RNA) in the 5′-UTR of a gene that does not cycle under normal conditions resulted in cycling of the message (18Mahmood R. Hines J.C. Ray D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6174-6182Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In our effort to understand the mechanism of this message cycling, we identified and purified a high molecular mass complex, the cycling sequence-binding protein (CSBP) that binds to the cycling sequence with high sequence specificity (18Mahmood R. Hines J.C. Ray D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6174-6182Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Mahmood R. Ray D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23729-23734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 20Mahmood R. Mittra B. Hines J.C. Ray D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4453-4459Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The binding of CSBP to the TOP2 5′-UTR RNA and to the 6× octamer RNA probe varied during the cell cycle in parallel with the levels of the putative target mRNAs (18Mahmood R. Hines J.C. Ray D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6174-6182Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The putative target mRNAs are found to be most stable at times when the cycling sequence binding activity is high, and the message levels decline sharply in parallel with the decrease in binding activity. Based on these observations, we had proposed that the binding of the CSBP protein complex to the octamer sequence might confer a cell cycle-dependent stabilization of transcripts containing these sequence elements. To study its functional role, the gene encoding CSBPA, one of the two subunits of the CSBP complex (20Mahmood R. Mittra B. Hines J.C. Ray D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4453-4459Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), has been disrupted by gene replacement. Although the knock-out of the gene resulted in a loss of both CSBPA and CSBPB proteins, the putative target message levels were found to still cycle in the CSBPA null mutant cells. This mutant cell line has allowed us to detect the presence of an alternate cycling sequence binding activity. This activity termed CSBP II is also a high molecular mass complex comparable to the earlier described CSBP complex. CSBP II also shows high sequence specificity in binding to RNA probes. We report here the identification, purification, and biochemical characterization of this CSBP II protein complex. Knock-out of CSBPA Gene by Gene Replacement—The CSBPA gene was targeted by homologous recombination. Targeting constructs were created to replace both alleles of the gene. Homologous sequences that were used in the targeting constructs were PCR-amplified from the plasmid pJH3748 (20Mahmood R. Mittra B. Hines J.C. Ray D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4453-4459Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) with TaqDNA polymerase (Invitrogen) following conditions given by the supplier. The targeting sequences flanking the CSBPA gene were amplified with the primer pairs G17 (5′-GATATCTGCGCCGCGTGGGAA-3′) and F104 (5′ CTCGGGATCCACACCTCGAGTGTGTGTCAGCTTGTCGG-3′) and F65 (5′-CTCGGGATCCCATGCGAGGCGGGAAGGAGAGC-3′) and F66 (5′-GATATCCGCAGCCTCCGTCGCCGCT-3′), respectively. The amplified products were cloned separately in plasmid pCRII-TOPO using a TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen), yielding the plasmids pMS38.1 and pMS38.2, respectively. The hygromycin phosphotransferase expression cassette was released from the plasmid pX63HYG (21Cruz A. Coburn C.M. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7170-7174Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) as a SalI-BglII fragment and ligated under cohesive-end ligation conditions with EcoRV-XhoI and BamHI-EcoRV fragments from pMS38.1 and pMS38.2, respectively. The linear ligation product was gel-purified and cloned at the EcoRV site of pGEM5 to give pMS38.6. Digestion of this plasmid construct yielded the EcoRV fragment b (Fig.1A) used for electroporation of Crithidia as described previously (15Pasion S.G. Brown G.W. Brown L.M. Ray D.S. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3515-3520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For targeting the second allele of CSBPA, the 5′-flanking sequence of the CSBPA gene was PCR-amplified using the primers G17 and F104, whereas the 3′-flanking sequence was amplified using the primer pair F105 (5′-CTCGGGATCCGCTTCGCTTCACGCTTCA-3′) and G18 (5′-GATATCTCTCCTCTCTCTCTG-3′). The amplified 5′-flanking sequence was digested with XhoI, and the 3′-flanking sequence was digested with BamHI and gel-purified. The purified products were ligated with a XhoI-BamHI neomycin phosphotransferase expression cassette derived from pX.2KO (15Pasion S.G. Brown G.W. Brown L.M. Ray D.S. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3515-3520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The linear ligation product was then cloned using a TOPO TA cloning kit to give pMS38.7. Digestion of pMS38.7 with EcoRV produced construct c (Fig. 1A), which was used for disruption of the remaining allele of CSBPA. Plasmid DNA (10 μg) containing the targeting constructs was digested with appropriate restriction enzymes to release the targeting fragments. The digested DNA was electroporated in C. fasciculata cells as described previously (15Pasion S.G. Brown G.W. Brown L.M. Ray D.S. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3515-3520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Electroporated cells were selected for drug resistance on agar plates containing brain heart infusion medium (Invitrogen) plus hemin (20 μg/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) in the presence of the appropriate drug. Genomic DNA was isolated from putative mutant strains and analyzed by Southern blot analysis to confirm each gene replacement. CSBPA Expression Construct—To make the CSBPA expression construct, a 4.9-kb HindIII fragment of C. fasciculata genomic DNA containing CSBPA coding sequence and 1.6-kb 5′- and 2.0-kb 3′-flanking sequences was cloned at the HindIII site of the blasticidin resistance plasmid pGL437B (22Brooks D.R. McCulloch R. Coombs G.H. Mottram J.C. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2000; 186: 287-291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to give pMS38.10. A 235-bp fragment containing the N terminus of the CSBPB gene was deleted from the construct by PCR mutagenesis to yield the CSBPA expression plasmid pMS38.20. This plasmid was electroporated into C. fasciculata CSBPA null mutant cells as described previously (15Pasion S.G. Brown G.W. Brown L.M. Ray D.S. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3515-3520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and plated on brain heart infusion medium (Invitrogen) plus hemin (20 μg/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) in the presence of blasticidin S HCl (Invitrogen) at 100 μg/ml. Northern Blot Analysis—RNA was prepared from 2 × 107 Crithidia cells using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen). RNA samples (10 μg) were loaded onto 1.2% formaldehyde-agarose gels and electrophoresed for 17 h at 22 V with continuous circulation of buffer. The RNA was then transferred to Hybond-XL membrane (Amersham Biosciences), UV-cross-linked, and subsequently probed with different radioactive probes. Western Blotting—C. fasciculata cell lysate from 3 × 106 cells was fractionated by 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted as described previously (15Pasion S.G. Brown G.W. Brown L.M. Ray D.S. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3515-3520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Blots were probed with polyclonal anti-CSBPA and anti-CSBPB sera at 1:5000 dilution. Preparation of RNA Probes—Radioactive 32P-labeled RNA probes were prepared by in vitro transcription reactions from the T7 polymerase promoter as described previously (18Mahmood R. Hines J.C. Ray D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6174-6182Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using the Maxiscript kit (Ambion). Plasmids pRM16 and pRM23 (18Mahmood R. Hines J.C. Ray D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6174-6182Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) linearized with NotI were used as templates for preparation of the 6× wild-type (CAUAGAAG) and mutant (CAUAGcAG) octamer probes. TOP2 wild-type or mutant probes were prepared as described previously (19Mahmood R. Ray D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23729-23734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The two octamer sequences present in the TOP2 5′-UTR were mutated singly or both from CATAGAAG to TGCGAGGA. Plasmids containing the wild-type –291 to –209 fragment of the TOP2 5′-UTR or its mutant forms were linearized with HindIII and used as templates for PCR reactions to introduce a T7 promoter upstream of the sequence to be transcribed. The PCR product was then used as template for synthesizing 32P-labeled RNA using the Ambion Maxiscript Kit. The RNA probes were gel-purified, heated at 65 °C for 15 min, and then allowed to cool to room temperature before being used in assays. Gel Retardation Assays—Cycling sequence binding activity was monitored by performing binding assays (19Mahmood R. Ray D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23729-23734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) using RNA probes in reactions containing 10 mg/ml heparin and RNase inhibitor (10 units/reaction). Formation of RNA-protein complex was observed by relative shift in mobility of the radiolabeled probe when electrophoresed in a polyacrylamide gel. Following incubation of the binding reactions at 28 °C for 30 min, the samples were analyzed by electrophoresis in a 6% (60:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide) polyacrylamide gel (3 h at 4 °C, 150 V, in 0.5× Tris borate EDTA), which had been pre-electrophoresed for 45 min under the same running conditions. The gels were then dried and exposed to x-ray films at –70 °C with intensifying screens. To quantitate the extent of RNA-protein complex formation, dried gels were exposed to a PhosphorImager screen and radioactive bands were quantitated with a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). UV-cross-linking—Binding reactions were performed as described previously with DE52 purified cell extracts or RNA affinity column-purified CSBP II activity using 32P-labeled 6× wild-type or mutant probes. Following incubation at 28 °C for 30 min, the reactions were chilled in ice for 5 min and then transferred onto a parafilm strip, which was again placed on ice. The binding reactions were then irradiated with UV light (Stratalinker, Stratagene) for 1 min at a distance of 9 cm from the light source. The reactions were transferred to fresh tubes to which RNase A and RNase T1 were added and further incubated at 37 °C for another 30 min. The samples were then combined with one-third volume of 4× Laemmli buffer (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207478) Google Scholar) and heated at 100 °C for 3 min before being loaded onto a 0.5-mm thick, 15-cm long 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Electrophoresis was carried out in TGS buffer (27 mm Tris, 187 mm glycine, 0.1% SDS) under a constant current of 20 mAmp for 3 h at room temperature. The gel was then dried and analyzed by phosphorimaging. Preparation of Crithidia Cell Extracts—Wild type or CSBPA null mutant C. fasciculata cells were grown in brain heart infusion medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with hemin (20 μg/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) at 28 °C with shaking. Cells were harvested at a concentration of 5–7 × 107 cells/ml from 4 liters of culture. Cell extracts were prepared from the cells essentially as described previously (19Mahmood R. Ray D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23729-23734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The harvested cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and then with buffer A (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The cells were resuspended in 25 ml of buffer B (buffer A containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40), incubated on ice for 10 min, and then centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 15 min in a Sorvall SS34 rotor. The cell pellet was further resuspended in buffer C (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), passed through a 20-G needle five times, and further incubated on ice for 15 min before being centrifuged (SS34 rotor, 12,000 rpm, 15 min, 4 °C). An equal volume of buffer D (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 20% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) was then added to the supernatant. The pellet extraction step with buffers C and D was repeated twice. The total extracts were pooled together and used for assays or were stored at –70 °C until further use. Purification of CSBP II Activity and SDS-PAGE Analysis—All of the steps in the purification of CSBP II activity were performed at 4 °C or below. For further purification of the CSBP II activity, the cell extracts were first subjected to 0–40% (of saturation at 0 °C) ammonium sulfate precipitation. The precipitated protein was dissolved in buffer E (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT) and centrifuged in a Beckman Ti45 rotor for 30 min at 40,000 rpm at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and dialyzed against buffer E lacking glycerol for 1 h at 4 °C. Following dialysis, glycerol was added to the dialysate to 20% final concentration and the dialysate was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 15 min in a Sorvall SS34 rotor. The cleared supernatant was loaded onto a 25-ml DE52 column pre-equilibrated with buffer E containing 50 mm KCl. The column was first washed with 5 column volumes of equilibration buffer, and the CSBP II activity was eluted with buffer E containing 125 mm KCl. The active DE52 fractions were pooled and further concentrated with a 0–40% ammonium sulfate cut. The precipitated proteins were dissolved in buffer F (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT) and divided into three aliquots. Each aliquot was filtered though 0.22 μm SpinX filters (Costar) and subsequently loaded onto a UNO Q6 anion exchange column (Bio-Rad) pre-equilibrated with buffer F. The column was washed with 5 column volumes of equilibration buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted with a gradient of 0–0.35 m KCl in buffer F. The UNO Q-purified active fractions were diluted with an equal volume of buffer F and then purified further on a 6× octamer RNA affinity column. The column was prepared as described earlier (14Hotchkiss T.L. Nerantzakis G.E. Dills S.C. Shang L. Read L.K. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 98: 117-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) by attaching a RNA with six copies of the wild-type octamer cycling sequence (6× CAUAGAAG) followed by a (A)25 tail onto a oligo(dT) matrix. The column was successively eluted with buffer F containing 0.05, 0.15, 0.3, 0.6, and 1 m KCl. The CSBP II activity eluted with buffer containing 1 m salt. The purified CSBP II protein fraction was analyzed by electrophoresis in a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% SDS, and the protein bands were visualized by Sypro Ruby staining (Molecular Probes). Glycerol Gradient and Gel Filtration Analyses—UNO Q-purified CSBP II activity was diluted by adding an equal volume of buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, and 1 mm DTT to reduce the glycerol and salt concentrations. BSA was added to the diluted protein for stabilization followed by concentration on a Centricon-10 column. The final buffer contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm DTT. Fifty microliters of this concentrated sample were analyzed by 10–30% glycerol gradient sedimentation as described previously (20Mahmood R. Mittra B. Hines J.C. Ray D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4453-4459Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Another 50-μl aliquot of CSBP II was subjected to gel-sieving chromatography on a Superose 12 column (Amersham Biosciences) as detailed earlier (20Mahmood R. Mittra B. Hines J.C. Ray D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4453-4459Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). CSBPA Gene Knock-out Results in the Loss of Both CSBPA and CSBPB Protein Expression—The CSBPA gene was disrupted by targeted gene replacement through homologous recombination. Constructs b and c (Fig 1A) were used to sequentially replace the two alleles of the CSBPA gene (construct a), thereby generating clones heterozygous for CSBPA gene (A+/–) and CSBPA null mutants (A–/–), respectively. Southern blots of the wild-type, CSBP(A +/–), and CSBP(A –/–) cells confirmed replacement of both alleles of the gene by drug cassettes (data not shown). Western blot analyses were performed with cell lysates from wild-type and mutant cells to confirm the absence of CSBPA protein in the mutant cells (Fig. 1B). The blot was probed with rabbit anti-CSBPA and anti-CSBPB antisera. Levels of both CSBPA and CSBPB were decreased in the heterozygote as compared with the level detected in wild-type cells. CSBPA was totally absent in extracts from CSBPA null mutant cells, but surprisingly, the CSBPB protein was also observed to be absent, even upon prolonged exposure of the blot. Thus, the knock-out of the CSBPA gene eventually depleted the cells of both CSBPA and CSBPB proteins. Northern blots of total RNA from CSBPA null mutant cells (Fig. 2A) show that the CSBPB mRNA level in the mutant cells is similar to that of wild-type cells. Also, episomal expression of CSBPA protein in the CSBPA mutant cells restored wild-type levels of both CSBPA and CSBPB proteins (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that the loss of expression of CSBPA affects CSBPB expression at a post-transcriptional level, possibly at the level of protein stability or synthesis. Although the mechanism of the apparent co-regulation of these proteins is unknown, the mutant cell line has allowed us to search for and identify a second protein complex that specifically binds the octamer consensus sequence. Target Message Levels Continue to Cycle in the Absence of CSBPA and CSBPB Proteins—We further investigated the role of CSBPA and CSBPB proteins in cycling of the putative target messages using CSBPA null mutant cells depleted of both CSBPA and CSBPB proteins. Northern blot analyses were performed with total RNA isolated at 30-min intervals from hydroxyurea-synchronized cells. The relative levels of TOP2, RPA1, and DHFR-TS mRNAs, which have been shown previously to cycle during the cell cycle, were determined (Fig. 3). The levels of these messages were found to still cycle even in the absence of CSBPA and CSBPB. The message levels were lowest between 90 and 150 min, the period in which the percentage of dividing cells is highest. The message levels then increased during the 180–240-min time period corresponding to the highest levels of DNA synthesis (15Pasion S.G. Brown G.W. Brown L.M. Ray D.S. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3515-3520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The level of CaBP message detected as the loading control was constant throughout the cell cycle. These data indicate that the cycling sequence-binding proteins CSBPA and CSBPB are not essential for cycling of the RPA1, TOP2, and DHFR-TS mRNA levels. Presence of a Cycling Sequence Binding Activity in CSBPA Null Mutant Cells—Evidence of cycling of putative target messages in the CSBPA null mutant cells necessitated further search for any alternate cycling sequence binding activity other than CSBP. Gel-shifts assays were performed with whole-cell extracts of CSBPA null mutant cells using a –291 to –209 5′-UTR transcript of the TOP2 gene as probe (Fig. 4). This 83-nucleotide RNA includes two octamer cycling sequences, and binding to this RNA probe by CSBP was shown previously to depend on these cycling elements (19Mahmood R. Ray D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23729-23734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The RNA probe (lane 1) containing two wild-type octameric sequences (represented by open squares) is efficiently bound by factor(s) in the CSBPA mutant cell extract (lane 2). However, when RNA probes with mutations in either one or both of the octamer sequences (represented by solid squares) were used in assays, binding was reduced (lanes 4 and 6) or completely abolished (lane 8). Mutation of the 3′-octamer (lanes 5 and 6) had a greater effect on binding than a mutation in the 5′-octamer (lanes 3 and 4). A similar observation was made previously with wild-type Crithidia nuclear extracts (19Mahmood R. Ray D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23729-23734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). No binding was observed when both the octamer sequences were mutated (lanes 7 and 8). A small shift of each of the radioactive probes relative to the bulk of the free probe is seen even in the absence of extract and is somewhat greater in the presence of extract. The nature of these species has not been investigated further. These results indicate the presence of additional cycling sequence binding protein(s) in CSBPA mutant cells other than CSBPA or CSBPB. Cycling Sequence Binding Activity in CSBPA Null Mutant Cells Is Sequence-specific—To determine the specificity of binding of the cycling sequence binding protein(s) in CSBPA null mutant cells, hereafter referred to as CSBP II, radiolabeled RNA containing six copies of the wild-type octamer sequence (separated by 2-nucleotide spacers) or its mutant"

Several coat proteins have been described that are involved in the formation of carrier vesicles at different points in the secretory and endocytic trafficking pathways (1Schekman R. Orci L.

J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 97: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Essential to vesicle trafficking is the initiating step of cargo recognition by heterotetrameric adaptor protein (AP) complexes in association with regulatory molecules, followed by the recruitment of clathrin to the membrane for budding and vesicle formation (5Brodsky F.M.

Biol. 1999; 15: 705-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Each heterotetramer of the TGN- and PM-associated AP complexes, AP-1 and AP-2 respectively, consist of two large adaptins (γ and α are found together with β1 and β2, respectively, ∼100 kDa), one medium-sized adaptin (μ1or μ2, ∼50 kDa) and one small adaptin (σ1or σ2, ∼20 kDa) (2Boehm M.

The corresponding subunits of each AP complex are homologous to one another (25–84% amino acid identity), which suggest functional similarity, and each adaptin has been shown to fulfill a different function. Their predominant role is as follows: the β subunits are important for clathrin binding (8Ahle S. Ungewickell E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20089-20093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Shih W. Gallusser A. Kirchhausen T. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 619-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar); μ-adaptins recognize and bind cargo for selection into CCVs via distinct sorting signals found in the cytoplasmic domains of certain transmembrane proteins: tyrosine-based motifs YXXϕ (where ϕ is a bulky hydrophobic residue) or NPXY and di-leucine/acidic residues (12Bonifacino J.S. Dell'Angelica E.C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). To date there is no function assigned to the σ subunits. Recently, two structurally related AP complexes, AP-3 and AP-4 have been identified (2Boehm M. Bonifacino J.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2907-2920Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 3Robinson M.S. Bonifacino J S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 444-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Previously, the functional roles of the AP complexes were based on biochemical and morphological experiments; however, more recent investigations have used targeted disruptions or naturally occurring mutants for the study of the physiological roles of these adaptor proteins (13Boehm M. Bonifacino J.S. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 286: 175-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In contrast to Saccharomyces cerevisiae where AP-1 and AP-2 are not essential for cell viability, it has been demonstrated that AP-1, although not required for cell viability in culture, is essential for the development of Caenorhabditis elegans and mice, and AP-2 is necessary for C. elegans embryonal development (14Huang K.M.

Cell. 2000; 10: 309-316Google Scholar).Leishmania are kinetoplastid protozoan parasites that are responsible for several important human diseases, ranging from mild skin ulcers to fatal visceral disease. These organisms lead a digenetic life style, where several forms of extracellular, flagellated, motile promastigotes colonize the digestive tract of vector sandflies. Upon transmission to the mammalian host during bloodfeeding by the insect, the promastigotes transform to non-flagellated, intracellular amastigotes, which reside in the phagolysosomes of macrophages (18Alexander J. Russell D.G. Adv. Parasitol. 1992; 31: 175-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Extensive studies have shown that the cell surface of both life cycle stages of these pathogens are coated with high levels of varying GPI-anchored glycoprotein, glycoconjugates, and glycolipids, which, depending on the Leishmania species studied, are vital for survival and virulence in the harsh environments that are encountered by the parasite (19Turco S.J.

A microtubular corset lines the plasma membrane maintaining the morphology of the cell and appears to prohibit membrane fusion. All endocytosis and exocytosis occurs at an anterior specialized invagination of the cell surface membrane at the point of the emerging flagellum, termed the flagellar pocket (22Webster P. Russell D.G. Parasitol. Today. 1993; 9: 201-206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 23Overath P. Stierhof Y.-D. Wiese M. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 27-33Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Organelles involved in the secretory/endocytic pathways are located between the flagellar pocket and the nucleus (24Weise F. Stierhof Y.-D. Kuehn C. Wiese M. Overath P. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4587-4603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These morphological features make Leishmania and related organisms, such as Trypansoma brucei, interesting models for protein trafficking studies. For both Leishmania and T. brucei, several transmembrane proteins have been identified that have the potential to be used in protein trafficking studies (23Overath P. Stierhof Y.-D. Wiese M. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 27-33Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In particular, a membrane-bound acid phosphatase of L. mexicana contains within its cytoplasmic domain both tyrosine-based and diisoleucine sorting signals (25Wiese M. Berger O. Stierhof Y.D. Wolfram M. Fuchs M. Overath P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 82: 153-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and in T. brucei, p67, a lysosomal membrane glycoprotein contains within its carboxyl terminus two di-leucine motifs (26Kelley R.J. Alexander D.L. Cowan C. Balber A.E. Bangs J.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 98: 17-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Both of these proteins localize to endosomal/lysosomal compartments of each respective organism, but little is known about their intracellular trafficking. The presence of these putative sorting motifs suggests that the molecular machinery for adaptin-mediated sorting maybe conserved in these highly divergent group of unicellular eukaryotes. With the recent advent of the genome sequencing projects for both L. major and T. brucei, several sequences encoding potential components of the secretory/endocytic pathways have been identified. Homologues for several Rab proteins and clathrin of T. brucei are now being used as markers for the identification of subcellular compartments involved in protein trafficking (27McConville M.J.

Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Large- and small-scale parasite genomic DNA were purified according to protocols previously described (31Coulson R.M.R. Smith D.F. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1990; 40: 63-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 32Medina-Acosta E. Cross G.A.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 59: 327-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA and DNA fragments from agarose gels were isolated using commercial kits according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). Polymerase chain reactions (PCR) were performed using the Expand™ high fidelity PCR system (Roche Applied Science). All PCR products were subcloned into the TA cloning vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method using an ALFexpress automated sequencer (Amersham Biosciences). DNA probes were generated using a PCR-DIG labeling kit (Roche Applied Science). On nucleic acid blots the labeled DNA was detected using anti-DIG-Fab fragments coupled to alkaline phosphatase (Roche Applied Science) and CDP-Star™ as the chemiluminescent substrate according to the manufacturer's instructions.Cloning of the L. mexicana Lmxσ1-adaptin Gene and Generation of Deletion and Addback Constructs—The Block Maker program (www.blocks.fhcrc.org) was used to align ungapped, highly conserved regions of the σ1 subunit amino acid sequence from the organisms (SWISS-PROT accession codes given in parentheses): Homo sapiens (P56377), Mus musculus (Q00382), S. cerevisiae (P35181), and Arabidopsis thaliana (AAB96887). Peptide sequences from the resulting conserved blocks were used to design a series of degenerate primers: 5′-CA(A/G)GG(A/G/C/T)AA(A/G)ITICG(A/G/C/T)CT(A/G/C/T)I(A/C)IAA(A/G)TGGTA, CA(A/G)GG(A/G/C/T)AA(A/G)ITICG(A/G/C/T)TT(A/G)I(A/C)IAA(A/G)TGGTA, CA(A/G)GG(A/G/C/T)AA(A/G)ITIAG(A/G)CT(A/G/C/T)I(A/C)IAA(A/G)TGGTA, CA(A/G)GG(A/G/C/T)AA(A/G)ITIAG(A/G)TT(A/G)I(A/C)IAA(A/G)TGGTA, and 3′-AA(A/G/T)AT(A/G/T)AT(A/G)TC(A/G/C/T)AG(C/T)TC(A/G)CA(A/G/C/T)AC. PCR was performed using this mixture of oligonucleotides with L. mexicana genomic DNA, and the derived 284-bp fragment was subcloned into the TA cloning vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced. This DIG-labeled PCR product was used to screen a λ-DashII L. mexicana genomic DNA library (25Wiese M. Berger O. Stierhof Y.D. Wolfram M. Fuchs M. Overath P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 82: 153-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and a ∼3.3-kb NotI fragment from positive clones was subcloned into pBSK+ (Stratgene) and sequenced on both strands. Using data base searches the ORF corresponding to Lmxσ1-adaptin was identified by homology to other known σ-adaptins. The sequence data for the Lmxσ1-adaptin-containing genomic DNA fragment has been submitted to the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank™ data base under accession code AF514805. For the derivation of double targeting gene replacement cassettes, PCR was carried out for amplification of the 5′-upstream region of Lmxσ1- adaptin using the primers GTCGAGCGGCCGCGCGGCCTCGCCG and CCATGCCATGGCGCCCACACGCGCGTGCAG (where a NcoI restriction site was introduced at the translation initiation codon of Lmxσ1-adaptin ORF), and for the 3′-downstream region ATACGCCCTAGGGGGTGTAGGTTGCCCGTC (where an AvrII site was inserted at the stop codon of the Lmxσ1-adaptin ORF) and ACGCGTCGACGCGGCCGCGCCTCGTCTGCA. The NotI/NcoI-digested Lmxσ1- adaptin 5′-upstream, the AvrII/NotI-digested Lmxσ1- adaptin 3′-downstream PCR DNA fragments and a NcoI/AvrII DNA fragment encoding the hygromycin phosphotransferase ORF (HYG) (33Cruz A. Coburn C.M. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7170-7174Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) were consecutively ligated into pBSK+. A NcoI/AvrII DNA fragment containing the phleomycin gene (PHLEO) was used for the second Lmxσ1- adaptin gene replacement construct. For chromosomal integration, linear DNA fragments for transfection of L. mexicana promastigotes containing the HYG- and PHLEO- Lmxσ1- adaptin gene replacement cassettes were excised by NotI digestion. For episomal and chromosomal protein expression in the gene deletion mutant background, vectors containing the ORF were constructed. The Lmxσ1-adaptin ORF obtained by PCR (see “Antibodies” below), was excised from the TA cloning vector by BamHI digestion and subcloned into the pX63PAC episomal vector (34Freedman D.J. Beverley S.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 62: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). For protein expression under the control of the rRNA promoter, PCR was performed with the following primers: ATCGATATGATTCAGTTCCTG and TCTAGATCATACACCCTTGATGGC and a Lmxσ1- adaptin gene containing DNA fragment, to introduce ClaI and XbaI restriction enzymes sites for subcloning of the ORF into the pSSU-int plasmid (35Miβlitz A. Mottram J.C. Overath P. Aebischer T. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 107: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The integration cassette was excised by digestion with PacI and PmeI for transfection of L. mexicana promastigotes.Cloning of the L. mexicana Lmxμ1-adaptin Gene and Generation of Deletion and Addback Constructs—A potential partial μ1-adaptin L. major sequence was found using the keyword search of the Leishmania Proteome data base (www.ebi.ac.uk/parasite/LGN/Proteome/proteome.html), deposited in the GenBank™ data base under the accession code AQ846242. Based on this sequence, the following primers were designed and used in PCR with L. mexicana genomic DNA: TACACCTTCGTGCGCGAGAA and ATCGAGCAGGTCGACATGCT. After subcloning into the TA cloning vector (Invitrogen) and sequencing of the derived 410-bp PCR product, this DIG-labeled DNA fragment was used to screen a λ-DashII L. mexicana genomic DNA library (25Wiese M. Berger O. Stierhof Y.D. Wolfram M. Fuchs M. Overath P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 82: 153-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and a ∼6-kb EcoRI fragment from positive clones was subcloned into pBSK+ (Stratgene) and sequenced on both strands. Using data base searches the ORF corresponding to Lmxμ1-adaptin was identified by homology to other known μ1-adaptins. The sequence data for the Lmxμ1- adaptin-containing genomic DNA fragment has been submitted to the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank™ data base under accession code AF514806. For the construction of double targeting gene replacement cassettes, PCR was carried out for amplification of the 5′-upstream region of Lmxμ1- adaptin using the primers GCGGCCGCTGGATGTGTGTGCAT and CCATGGCACCTGCGGACGTAC (where a NotI restriction site was introduced at the 5′-end of this fragment, and a NcoI site was introduced at the translation initiation codon of Lmxμ1-adaptin ORF). For the 3′-downstream region the primers pairs CCTAGGGACGGAATGATGGGC and GCGGCCGCACGCACTGCAGCTGC (where at the 5′-end of this DNA fragment an AvrII site was inserted at the stop codon of the Lmxμ1-adaptin ORF and a NotI site at the 3′end) were used. The NotI/NcoI digested Lmxμ1- adaptin 5′-upstream, the AvrII/NotI-digested Lmxμ1- adaptin 3′-downstream PCR DNA fragments and a NcoI/AvrII DNA fragment encoding the hygromycin phosphotransferase ORF (HYG) (33Cruz A. Coburn C.M. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7170-7174Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) were consecutively ligated into pBSK+. A NcoI/AvrII DNA fragment containing the phleomycin gene (PHLEO) was used for the second Lmxμ1- adaptin gene replacement construct. For chromosomal integration, linear DNA fragments for transfection of L. mexicana promastigotes containing the HYG- and PHLEO- Lmxμ1- adaptin gene replacement cassettes were excised by NotI digestion. For episomal and chromosomal protein expression in the gene deletion mutant background, vectors containing the ORF were constructed. The amplified Lmxμ1-adaptin ORF (see “Antibodies” section below) was excised from the TA cloning vector by BamHI/HindIII digestion and the ends filled in with Klenow enzyme (Roche Applied Science) to yield a blunt-ended fragment, followed by ligation into BamHI-digested/ends-filled-in pX63PAC episomal vector (34Freedman D.J. Beverley S.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 62: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). For protein expression under the control of the rRNA promoter this blunt-ended Lmxμ1-adaptin ORF-containing DNA fragment was subcloned into ClaI/XbaI-digested/ends-filled-in pSSU-int plasmid (35Miβlitz A. Mottram J.C. Overath P. Aebischer T. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 107: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The integration cassette was excised by digestion with PacI and PmeI for transfection of L. mexicana promastigotes.Antibodies—For high level expression and purification of L. mexicana σ1- and μ1-adaptin recombinant proteins the pQE-8 vector (Qiagen) was used. In order to subclone the full-length ORFs into the BamHI/HindIII sites of this plasmid, PCR was carried out to introduce these restriction sites using the primer pairs: CGCGGATCCATGATTCAGTTCCTGCTG and AAGCTTTCATACACCCTTGATGGCGTT for Lmxσ1- adaptin and GGATCCATGGCGTCGGTGCTGTA and AAGCTTTCAGTCCGTTCGTAT for Lmxμ1- adaptin. To avoid sequencing the entire Lmxμ1- adaptin amplified ORF, an internal AatII/BspEI of this PCR product was replaced by the same DNA fragment excised from the genomic subclone. The sequences of these constructs were verified and used for transformation of competent E. coli M15 cells. Cell culture, induction of recombinant protein expression, and batch purification of solubilized inclusion bodies (8 m urea) by Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose chromatography were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). Rabbits were immunized with 200 μg of each purified recombinant protein or with 300 μg of a 15-residue peptide corresponding to the carboxyl terminus of Lmxσ1-adaptin (coupled to KLH (Calbiochem) via an inserted amino-terminal cysteine residue as described previously, Ref. 30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), emulsified with 50% (v/v) complete Freund's adjuvant for primary immunizations and with 50% (v/v) incomplete Freund's adjuvant for all subsequent boosts. Polyclonal antisera were collected 14 days after each booster immunization. Anti-Lmxσ1-adaptin peptide antibodies were affinity-purified using as the ligand the peptide immobilized to SulfoLink™ coupling gel (Pierce) according to the supplier's instructions. In order to remove unspecific antibodies, antisera raised against the L. mexicana σ1- and μ1-adaptin full-length ORFs were absorbed using the respective L. mexicana-null mutant cell lines. Late logarithmic phase promastigotes were harvested, followed by a fixation step (rotating for 1 h at room temperature in PBS containing 0.05% glutaraldehyde and 2% formaldehyde), centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 1 h, permeabilized (rotating for 1 h at room temperature in PBS containing 1% skimmed milk powder, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% saponin) and centrifuged as before. The pellets were resuspended in the permeabilization buffer, and an aliquot of this was added to antiserum, rotated for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C, followed by centrifugation. This latter step was repeated several times using a fresh portion of permeabilized cells added to the resulting supernatant. The final supernatant was ultracentrifuged at 140,000 × g for 30 min.Analytic Procedures—To obtain protein for Western blot analysis, L. mexicana parasites were washed twice in PBS, followed by extraction of lipids by addition of CHCl3-CH3OH-H2O at a ratio of 1:2:0.8. Cells were immediately vortexed, incubated at room temperature for 30 min then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm in a benchtop microcentrifuge at room temperature. Solvents were removed from pellets by evaporation at 30 °C. The protein was then resuspended at the equivalent of 5 × 108 cells/ml in 50 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0 containing 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm phenylmethysulfonyl fluoride, 20 μm leupeptin, 5 mm o-phenanthroline, and 100 units/ml benzonuclease (Merck). After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min to digest nucleic acids, one-fifth volume of 5× sample buffer (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) was added. Discontinuous SDS-PAGE on 4% stacking gels over 7.5–20% resolving gradient gels, electrotransfer of proteins onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore) and incubations of the membranes with primary and secondary antibodies were performed as described previously (36Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies- A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Horseradish peroxidase-labeled antibodies were detected using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences) and stripping of blots for re-probing were both carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions.Infections of Mice and Peritoneal Macrophages—For mouse infection studies, groups of four Balb/c mice were used for each cell line. These experiments were performed in duplicate. The left hind footpad was injected with 107 stationary phase promastigotes resuspended in 30 μl of PBS. Using a caliper slide, the course of infections was followed by measuring footpad lesion size relative to the uninfected right hind footpad at 7–14-day intervals. For macrophage infection experiments, peritoneal cells were isolated from Balb/c mice by peritoneal lavage and seeded onto coverslips (13-mm diameter) at 2.5 × 105 to 106 cells per coverslip in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), which contained 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. After overnight incubation at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in air, non-adherent cells were removed by three washes of the coverslips with pre-warmed complete DMEM. Approximately 50% of the cells, which had adhered to the coverslips, judged as peritoneal macrophages by their morphology, were infected with stationary phase promastigotes, which had been washed and resuspended in complete DMEM, at a parasite to macrophage ratio of 2:1. Two coverslips were used per cell line. Following incubation overnight at 33 °C with 5% CO2 in air, residual-free promastigotes were removed by three washes using pre-warmed complete DMEM. Incubation at 33 °C with 5% CO2 in air was continued and coverslips removed at the required time points, washed with pre-warmed PBS, and fixed and stained with DAPI (see below). The number of parasitized macrophages and the number of L. mexicana amastigotes per host cell were counted by inspection with a fluorescence microscope.Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Coverslips containing parasitised peritoneal macrophages were washed three times with pre-warmed PBS, fixed by submerging in PBS containing 2% formaldehyde and 0.05% glutaraldehyde for 30 min, washed twice with room temperature PBS, incubated at room temperature for 30 min with DAPI (10 μg/ml) in blocking solution of PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin and 0.05 m NH4Cl, followed by three washes with room temperature PBS. The coverslips were mounted using Mowiol/Dabco and inspected by fluorescence microscopy. As duplicate infections were performed for each cell line, 300 macrophages were counted per coverslip, grouped according to parasite burden and the average taken.RESULTSCloning of the L. mexicana σ1- and μ1-adaptin Genes—For the cloning of the L. mexicana σ1-adaptin gene, σ1-adaptin protein sequences from other organisms were used to find conserved blocks. A series of degenerate oligonucleotides were designed based on the peptide sequences QGK(V/F)RL(T/Q/K)KWY and VCELDIIF and used in PCR with L. mexicana genomic DNA as the template. Sequencing of the amplified DNA identified a partial ORF with high homology to σ-adaptins. This PCR product was DIG-labeled and used to screen a λ-DashII L. mexicana genomic DNA library. Sequencing of a Lmxσ-adaptin gene-containing subcloned DNA fragment showed the presence of an ORF of 495 base pairs (bp, Fig. 2C) encoding a protein of a predicted molecular mass of ∼19.2 kDa (Figs. 1A and 3A) and a calculated isoelectric point of 7.9. Data base searches with the Lmxσ-adaptin ORF displayed significant homology of this sequence with other AP complex σ-adaptins from various organisms. Phylogenetic analysis of these sequences showed that the Lmxσ-adaptin ORF is grouped within the σ1 family of adaptins. The complied sequences of this group"

This complex, conserved from yeast to human, contains a heterodimer of structural maintenance of chromosome (SMC) family proteins and three additional non-SMC subunits. We have investigated the expression of the non-SMC condensin component XCAP-D2 in Xenopus laevis oocytes. When studied during meiotic maturation, XCAP-D2 starts to accumulate at the time of germinal vesicle breakdown and reaches its maximal amount in metaphase II oocytes. This accumulation is specifically blocked by injection of antisense oligonucleotides. XCAP-D2 antisense-injected oocytes progress normally through meiosis until metaphase II. At this stage, however, chromosomes exhibit architecture defaults, and resolution of sister chromatids is impaired. Surprisingly, in mitotic extracts made from XCAP-D2 knocked-down oocytes, sperm chromatin normally condenses into compacted chromosomes, whereas the amounts of both free and chromosome-bound XCAP-D2 are markedly reduced. This apparent discrepancy is discussed in light of current knowledge on chromosome dynamics.

This apparent discrepancy is discussed in light of current knowledge on chromosome dynamics. During mitosis, replicated genomes must be equally distributed between daughter cells. This implies proper segregation of sister chromatids, a process that in turn requires the chromatin to be condensed into compact mitotic chromosomes. The condensation and segregation of chromosomes require several activities, and among them is that of 13 S condensin, a pentameric complex that supports DNA-dependent ATPase activity and is able to introduce positive supercoils into DNA in the presence of ATP (1Hirano T. Kobayashi R. Hirano M. Cell. 1997; 89: 511-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 2Kimura K. Hirano T. Cell. 1997; 90: 625-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). The condensin subunits are conserved in a wide variety of species from yeast to mammals. In Xenopus laevis, they are given the name of XCAP-C, XCAP-E, XCAP-D2, XCAP-G, and XCAP-H. XCAP-C and XCAP-E belong to the structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) 1The abbreviations used are: SMC, structural maintenance of chromosome; topo, topoisomerase; AKAP95, 95-kDa A kinase-anchoring protein; DAPI, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; CPE, cytoplasmic polyadenylation element.1The abbreviations used are: SMC, structural maintenance of chromosome; topo, topoisomerase; AKAP95, 95-kDa A kinase-anchoring protein; DAPI, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; CPE, cytoplasmic polyadenylation element. family whose homologues are Smc4p and Smc2p in budding yeast (3Hirano T. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 399-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Numerous biochemical studies of the condensin components have been made in Xenopus egg extracts. In addition to the complete 13 S condensin complex, two subcomplexes have been described that contain some but not all subunits: an 8 S subcomplex composed of the two SMC subunits and a much less abundant 11 S subcomplex composed of the three non-SMC subunits (4Kimura K. Hirano T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11972-11977Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The non-SMC subunits were shown to be specifically phosphorylated in mitotic extracts, and this phosphorylation is necessary to stimulate supercoiling activity (5Kimura K. Hirano M. Kobayashi R. Hirano T. Science. 1998; 282: 487-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The functional contributions of the different condensin subcomplexes have been investigated by adding each of them back to immunodepleted extracts. These studies have led to the conclusion that condensation activity requires the entire 13 S condensin to be formed by joining both 8 and 11 S subcomplexes (2Kimura K. Hirano T. Cell. 1997; 90: 625-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 4Kimura K. Hirano T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11972-11977Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The regulatory 11 S subcomplex is required for targeting condensin to chromosomes in mitotic extracts. This subcomplex is also involved in modulating condensin activity. Whereas the SMC subunits share ATP-binding motifs, 8 S condensin has only poor ATPase activity. Its joining to 11 S condensin leads to the stimulation of both the DNA-dependent ATPase and supercoiling activities (4Kimura K. Hirano T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11972-11977Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). For these reasons, 8 and 11 S condensins are considered as core and regulatory subcomplexes, respectively. Genetic studies in yeast have unambiguously established that all condensin subunits are required for a correct segregation of sister chromatids (6Saka Y. Sutani T. Yamashita Y. Saitoh S. Takeuchi M. Nakaseko Y. Yanagida M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4938-4952Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 7Sutani T. Yuasa T. Tomonaga T. Dohmae N. Takio K. Yanagida M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2271-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 8Lavoie B.D. Hogan E. Koshland D. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 805-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In budding yeast it has been shown that loading of condensin onto chromatin requires the presence of each non-SMC subunit (8Lavoie B.D. Hogan E. Koshland D. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 805-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). However, the individual roles of these subunits have not been fully documented. For instance, the Barren protein (the Drosophila homologue of XCAP-H) was shown to interact with topoisomerase II (topo II) (9Bhat M.A. Philp A.V. Glover D.M. Bellen H.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 1103-1114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), but its possible role in topological separation of sister chromatids was not directly confirmed (10Lavoie B.D. Tuffo K.M. Oh S. Koshland D. Holm C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1293-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Recent studies carried out with mammalian cells suggest a role of XCAP-H in targeting the condensin complex onto chromatin through its interaction with the 95-kDa A kinase-anchoring protein (AKAP95) (11Eide T. Carlson C. Tasken K.A. Hirano T. Tasken K. Collas P. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 426-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The role of XCAP-D2 is even more elusive. Early studies used immunoblocking experiments to address the role of XCAP-D2 in Xenopus mitotic extracts. However, the observed effects of anti-XCAP-D2 antibodies on chromosome condensation probably reflected an inhibition of the whole condensin function (12Cubizolles F. Legagneux V. Le Guellec R. Chartrain I. Uzbekov R. Ford C. Le Guellec K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1437-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In human cells, a green fluorescent protein-tagged form of CNAP1 (the homologue of XCAP-D2) was reported to be addressed to the nucleus and loaded onto mitotic chromatin independently of other condensin components (13Ball Jr., A.R. Schmiesing J.A. Zhou C. Gregson H.C. Okada Y. Doi T. Yokomori K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5769-5781Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Domains involved in chromatin binding were shown to interact with H1 and H3 histones (13Ball Jr., A.R. Schmiesing J.A. Zhou C. Gregson H.C. Okada Y. Doi T. Yokomori K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5769-5781Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, the eventual role of XCAP-D2 in localizing and/or regulating the whole condensin complex has not yet been elucidated. Here we have studied the expression of XCAP-D2 during oocyte maturation in X. laevis as compared with the SMC subunits of the condensin complex. We show that XCAP-D2 strongly accumulates during oocyte maturation, whereas the levels of XCAP-E, XCAP-C, and XCAP-H remain approximately constant. We have taken advantage of this expression profile to design antisense oligonucleotides that are able to block XCAP-D2 accumulation when injected into oocytes before maturation. By using this approach, we show that meiotic maturation proceeds normally in XCAP-D2 knocked-down oocytes. However, the shape of meiotic chromosomes is altered, and sister chromatids fail to separate in these oocytes. In contrast, chromosome assembly is not markedly affected in mitotic extracts made from XCAP-D2 knocked-down oocytes. Antibodies—Antisera against XCAP-D2 and XCAP-E were obtained from rabbits immunized by injecting polypeptides corresponding to the C-terminal regions of these proteins (amino acids 1347–1360 and 1190–1203, respectively). Antibodies against XCAP-C (14Hirano T. Mitchison T.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 449-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar), monoclonal antibodies against pEg2 (15Roghi C. Giet R. Uzbekov R. Morin N. Chartrain I. Le Guellec R. Couturier A. Doree M. Philippe M. Prigent C. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 557-572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and anti-topoisomerase II antibodies (16de La Barre A.E. Gerson V. Gout S. Creaven M. Allis C.D. Dimitrov S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 379-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) were provided by Drs T. Hirano, C. Prigent, and S. Dimitrov, respectively. Anti-XCAP-H antibodies against the full-length recombinant protein expressed in Escherichia coli were provided by Drs K. Maeshima and U. K. Laemmli. Anti-β-tubulin monoclonal antibodies (Sigma) were used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein Extraction from Oocytes—Batches of 10 oocytes were homogenized in 100 μl of STE buffer (100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm potassium EDTA, pH 7.8) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, and 10 μg/ml chymostatin). Samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were extracted with 1 v/v of 1,1,2-trichlorofluoroethane and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitation—Aliquots of oocyte extracts (50 μl) were diluted 10-fold in XB-E2 (100 mm KCl, 50 mm sucrose, 10 mm Hepes, 5 mm potassium EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.7). After centrifugation at 13,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min, the supernatants were used for immunoprecipitations. Crude sera (1 μl/100 μl of diluted extract) were added to the clarified extracts and incubated at 4 °C for 3 h. Immunoprecipitates were then recovered by adding protein A-Sepharose beads (1:25, v/v) (Amersham Biosciences) and incubating for 1 h at room temperature with constant agitation. After centrifugation, beads were washed three times with 1 ml of XB-E2 containing 1% Nonidet P-40. Beads were resuspended in 50 μl of Laemmli sample buffer and heat-denatured by incubation at 90 °C for 10 min. 5 μl of each sample were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. Western Blot Analysis—Electrophoresis in SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electrotransfer onto nitrocellulose membranes were performed following standard procedures. Membranes were blocked in TBST (25 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20 (Sigma)) containing 5% skimmed milk for2hat4 °C. Membranes were incubated at 4 °Cfor1h with crude sera diluted 1,000-fold in TBST containing 2.5% skimmed milk. Immunocomplexes were revealed with alkaline phosphatase-coupled anti-rabbit antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Inc.) using a chemifluorescence assay (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Signals were quantified using ImageQuant (Amersham Biosciences). Preparation of Stage VI Oocytes and in Vitro Maturation—Ovarian follicles were first incubated in OR2 (82.5 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 5 mm Hepes, 1 mm Na2HPO4, 1 mm MgCl2, pH = 7.8) containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 400 μg/ml dispase II (Roche Applied Science) for 3 h at 20 °C. After rinsing several times in OR2, they were incubated at 20 °C in OR2 containing 5,000 units/15 ml collagenase I (Sigma) until oocytes were isolated. Finally they were rinsed and maintained in OR2 containing 1 mm CaCl2. In vitro maturations were obtained by incubating oocytes in OR2 containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 3 μm progesterone (Sigma) at 22 °C. Oligonucleotides and Oocyte Injection—The antisense oligonucleotides AS1 (5′-GTCTCCGCGCCAAAATGTCA-3′), AS2 (5′-CAGCCGCAGCAAGCCAAAC-3′), AS3 (5′-AACACCCGCTGTATCTCAATAAC-3′), and AS4 (5′-GGTGGAGCCTCACAGACGC-3′) were based on the 5′-untranslated region of XCAP-D2 mRNA (GenBank™ accession number AF067969). As controls, corresponding sense oligonucleotides were used. Oocytes were injected with either 30 nl of a mixture of each oligonucleotide (25 μm final concentration for each) or of a single oligonucleotide (100 μm final concentration). Mitotic Extracts from in Vitro Matured Oocytes—After maturation, oocytes were washed twice with XB-E2 and finally washed with XB-E2 containing 100 μg/ml cytochalasin B. Oocytes were packed at 200 × g at 16 °C for 1 min, and excess buffer was removed. Then oocytes were centrifuged at 12,000 × g at 16 °C for 15 min. The cytoplasmic component was taken and supplemented with cytochalasin B (100 μg/ml), Energy Mix 50× (50 mm ATP, 50 mm MgCl2, 375 mm phosphocreatine, 5 mm potassium EGTA) (1×) and the mixture of protease inhibitors described above. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g at 16 °C for 15 min, the cytoplasmic phase was used for experiments after addition of recombinant undegradable Cyclin B (provided by M. A. Felix (17Glotzer M. Murray A.W. Kirschner M.W. Nature. 1991; 349: 132-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1890) Google Scholar)) and represented the mitotic extract (18Murray A.W. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 36: 581-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). Sucrose Gradient Analysis—20 μl of protein extract were diluted 10-fold in XB-E2, overlaid on 4 ml of a 5–20% sucrose density gradient made in XB-E2, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 15 h in a SW50 rotor (Beckman). Fractions were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. In Vitro Chromosome Assembly and Analysis—Sperm nuclei were prepared as described previously (19Hutchison C.J. Cox R. Drepaul R.S. Gomperts M. Ford C.C. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2003-2010Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and stored in Sunap (0.25 mm sucrose, 75 mm NaCl, 0.15 mm spermine, 0.5 mm spermidine). 1–3 μl of sperm nuclei suspension (5000/μl) were added to 30 μl of mitotic extracts and incubated at 22 °C. Cytological analyses were performed as described previously (20Hutchison C.J. Cox R. Ford C.C. Development. 1988; 103: 553-566PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, 2-μl aliquots were mixed with 6 μl of fixative medium containing 3.3% formaldehyde and 10 μg/ml DAPI, mounted between glass slide and coverslip, sealed, and observed under fluorescence microscope. For biochemical analysis, 15-μl aliquots were diluted 10-fold in XB-E2, overlaid on 300 μl of a 30% sucrose cushion, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min in a JS13.1 rotor (Beckman). The supernatant was taken and mixed with 2× Laemmli sample buffer, the cushion was discarded, and the pellet was recovered in 50 μl of 1× Laemmli sample buffer. The different fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. XCAP-D2 Accumulates during Oocyte Maturation—We investigated the expression of XCAP-D2, XCAP-C, XCAP-E, and XCAP-H during oocyte maturation. Full grown oocytes were matured by incubation in progesterone at 22 °C. The maturation process was followed by monitoring the appearance of a characteristic white spot at the animal pole. This morphological change is known to mark the germinal vesicle breakdown, an early event in meiotic maturation. Fig. 1B shows that 100% of the oocytes underwent germinal vesicle breakdown between 2 and 8 h of incubation in progesterone. Protein samples were taken at 2-h intervals and analyzed by Western blotting with polyclonal antibodies specific for these proteins (Fig. 1A). Levels of XCAP-C and XCAP-E remained constant all along the maturation process. In contrast, XCAP-D2 was barely detectable until 4 h of incubation, and then it strongly accumulated. Quantification of XCAP-D2 signals showed that the accumulation of XCAP-D2 continued between 8 and 12 h, a period of time where 100% of the oocytes had undergone germinal vesicle breakdown (Fig. 1B, GVBD). Several independent experiments showed that the accumulation of XCAP-D2 stopped after about 15 h when the level of this protein became comparable to that observed in unfertilized eggs. Cytological observation of oocytes stained with DAPI showed that, after 12 h of incubation in progesterone, all of them had ejected the first polar body (data not shown). The XCAP-D2 level remained constant when oocytes were incubated for 12 h in the absence of progesterone (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 1 and 8). The expression of XCAP-D2 was further compared with that of XCAP-H, another non-SMC subunit of condensin (Fig. 1C). The amount of XCAP-H was found to increase much less strongly than that of XCAP-D2 (less than 2-fold and more than 10-fold, respectively). These data indicate that the expression levels of condensin subunits are differentially regulated during oocyte maturation. Newly Synthesized XCAP-D2 Is Recruited into the Condensin Complex—Xenopus eggs were shown to contain both the 8 and 13 S condensin complexes (1Hirano T. Kobayashi R. Hirano M. Cell. 1997; 89: 511-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). The 8 S core subcomplex is a heterodimer composed of XCAP-C and XCAP-E, whereas the 13 S holocomplex contains three additional subunits, XCAP-D2, XCAP-G, and XCAP-H. Accordingly the presence of XCAP-D2 in immunoprecipitates obtained with anti-XCAP-E antibodies can be taken as evidence of the 13 S complex. The assembly of 13 S condensin was therefore investigated during oocyte maturation by immunoprecipitation. Samples taken at different times after progesterone addition were immunoprecipitated with anti-XCAP-E antibodies and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-XCAP-C, anti-XCAP-E, and anti-XCAP-D2 antibodies. As shown in Fig. 2A, basal levels of XCAP-D2 present in non-mature oocytes were already associated with a complex that contained XCAP-C and XCAP-E (lanes 1 and 8). During the time course of maturation (lanes 2–7), the newly synthesized XCAP-D2 was recruited into this complex (compare Figs. 1A and 2A). That the recruitment of XCAP-D2 proceeded as long as it accumulated suggested that, even in fully matured oocytes, XCAP-D2 was not in excess with respect to XCAP-C and XCAP-E. To confirm this and to investigate the stoichiometry of these complexes, extracts made from mature and immature oocytes were analyzed by sucrose gradient centrifugation (Fig. 2, B and C). In immature oocytes (upper panels), XCAP-D2 was recovered in fractions 14 and 15 corresponding to sedimentation coefficients close to 13 S. Since these fractions also contained both XCAP-E and XCAP-H, they probably correspond to 13 S condensin. A major part of XCAP-E and XCAP-H was recovered in fractions 10–12 whose sedimentation coefficient was lower than 11.3 S. Although these proteins partially cofractionated, maximal amounts of XCAP-E were found in fractions 10–11, whereas XCAP-H peaked in fraction 12. Accordingly fractions 10–11 would contain 8 S condensin, whereas fraction 12 could correspond to another complex containing XCAP-H but devoid of XCAP-D2. In mature oocytes (Fig. 2, B and C, lower panels), the main part of XCAP-E and about 75% of XCAP-H was shifted to fractions higher than 11.3 S (fractions 14–17). According to their sedimentation coefficients, these fractions, which also contain newly synthesized XCAP-D2, probably correspond to the 13 S condensin complex. Taken together, these data indicate that the accumulated XCAP-D2 was entirely recruited into the 13 S condensin complex, confirming that this protein is not in excess with respect to the other condensin subunits in mature oocytes. Antisense Oligonucleotides Block XCAP-D2 Synthesis and 13 S Condensin Accumulation in Mature Oocytes—We reasoned that antisense oligonucleotides should inhibit XCAP-D2 expression by translationally inactivating its mRNA. Four adjacent sense/antisense oligonucleotide couples were derived from the 5′-untranslated region of XCAP-D2 mRNA (Fig. 3A). An equimolar mixture of the four sense or antisense oligonucleotides was injected into immature oocytes, and the expression of XCAP-D2 was analyzed by Western blot after progesterone treatment (Fig. 3B). The expression of pEg2, an unrelated protein that also accumulates during oocyte maturation (21Andresson T. Ruderman J.V. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5627-5637Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), was analyzed to check the specificity of oligonucleotides. In oocytes injected with sense oligonucleotides (lanes 3 and 4), neither the expression of XCAP-D2 nor that of pEg2 was affected as compared with their expression in non-injected oocytes (lanes 1 and 2). On the contrary, antisense oligonucleotides strongly inhibited the accumulation of XCAP-D2, whereas that of pEg2 remained unaffected (lanes 5 and 6). To limit eventual side effects, each of these oligonucleotides was individually microinjected into oocytes, and their effects on the expression of XCAP-D2 and pEg2 were analyzed after progesterone treatment (Fig. 3C). Antisense oligonucleotides AS1, AS3, and AS4 were found to efficiently inhibit XCAP-D2 synthesis, whereas the corresponding sense oligonucleotides had no effect. Oligonucleotide AS2 was found to be inefficient, whereas surprisingly the corresponding sense oligonucleotide (S2) partially affected XCAP-D2 accumulation. The synthesis of pEg2 was also diminished in oocytes that had been injected with S2 indicating that the effect of this oligonucleotide on XCAP-D2 synthesis was not specific. Among the antisense oligonucleotides that did affect the expression of XCAP-D2, AS3 had the least effect on the expression of pEg2. The specificity of the S3/AS3 oligonucleotide couple was analyzed in more detail in Fig. 3, D and E. The expression of XCAP-D2 was not affected by S3 oligonucleotide as compared with non-injected oocytes (compare lanes 2 and 3). When oocytes were injected with AS3 oligonucleotides, XCAP-D2 levels remained close to those observed in immature oocytes (compare lanes 1 and 4). Considering the total amount of XCAP-D2, this corresponded to a depletion of more than 95%. In contrast, neither S3 nor AS3 diminished levels of pEg2 that accumulate in mature oocytes. From these observations, the S3/AS3 couple was retained for further experiments. Since newly synthesized XCAP-D2 was found to be entirely recruited into the condensin complex, we compared the sedimentation behavior of condensin subunits in oocytes injected with either S3 or AS3 oligonucleotides and matured. For this purpose, protein extracts of both series were analyzed by sucrose density gradients (Fig. 3F). In sense-injected oocytes (upper panel), XCAP-E was distributed between the 8 S (fractions 10–11) and 13 S (fractions 15–17) complexes. This is consistent with previous reports showing that 8 and 13 S condensin complexes coexist in unfertilized eggs (1Hirano T. Kobayashi R. Hirano M. Cell. 1997; 89: 511-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). As in Fig. 2, XCAP-H was recovered in fractions corresponding to both the 13 S condensin (fractions 15–17) and complexes of lower densities. In antisense-injected oocytes (lower panel), the majority of both XCAP-E and XCAP-H were recovered in fractions whose sedimentation coefficients were lower than 13 S. This indicates that accumulation of 13 S condensin is prevented in XCAP-D2 knocked-down oocytes. Effect of XCAP-D2 Knock-down on Meiotic Chromosomes—To investigate the role of XCAP-D2 in the dynamics of meiotic chromosomes, oocytes were injected with sense or antisense oligonucleotides, matured, fixed in DAPI-containing methanol, and directly observed through the depigmented maturation spot. In these conditions both the first polar body and metaphase chromosomes were observable (Fig. 4A). Although not always present in the same optical field as metaphase chromosomes, the first polar body was observed in all the oocytes of both series, indicating that they had correctly passed the first meiotic division. Moreover chromosomes were correctly aligned on the metaphase plate in sense- as well as in antisense-injected oocytes. Although their overall compactness was not markedly affected, chromosomes of antisense-injected oocytes appeared thicker and rounder than those of sense-injected oocytes. The occurrence of this altered, ovoid shape was scored in both series (Fig. 4B), and it was confirmed that there were significantly more ovoid shaped chromosomes in antisense- than in sense-injected oocytes. A low number of ovoid chromosomes is also detected in the control oocytes. Since similar pictures were observed in non-injected oocytes (data not shown), this most probably reflects naturally occurring variations in either the shape or orientation of meiotic chromosomes. In mitotic cells, the cohesin complex dissociates from the chromosome arms by a proteolysis-independent pathway before the onset of anaphase (22Losada A. Hirano M. Hirano T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1986-1997Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar, 23Waizenegger I.C. Hauf S. Meinke A. Peters J.M. Cell. 2000; 103: 399-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). This potentially allows the separation of sister chromatids to be observed by simply extending the incubation in progesterone. In preliminary experiments, we showed that when full grown oocytes were observed 20 h after progesterone addition sister chromatids spontaneously separated from each other at several locations along the chromosome arms (data not shown). This spontaneous separation of sister chromatids was subsequently analyzed in oocytes that had been injected with sense or antisense oligonucleotides and then incubated with progesterone for 20 h (Fig. 4C). In sense-injected oocytes, a local separation of sister chromatids was visible on several chromosomes as either forks or bubbles (panel a, see arrowheads). On the contrary, such events were not observed in antisense-injected oocytes (panel b), suggesting that the separation of sister chromatids is impaired in the absence of newly synthesized XCAP-D2. Assembly of Chromosomes in Mitotic Extracts Made from XCAP-D2 Knocked-down Oocytes—When incubated in mitotic extracts prepared from unfertilized eggs, sperm chromatin undergoes local condensation and finally resolves into highly condensed individual chromosomes (18Murray A.W. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 36: 581-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar, 24Hirano T. Mitchison T.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 601-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). To investigate the potential role of newly synthesized XCAP-D2 in this process, mitotic extracts were prepared from mature oocytes injected with sense or antisense oligonucleotides. As expected from the data in Fig. 3D, the amount of XCAP-D2 was reduced by more than 95% in extracts made from knocked-down oocytes as compared with control extracts (Fig. 5A). Aliquots of the same extracts were incubated for 2 h with sperm chromatin and observed by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 5B). Surprisingly no obvious difference was detected between extracts made from control or antisense-injected oocytes (Fig. 5B, compare panels a and b with panels c and d). In both extracts, the chromatin efficiently condensed, forming fibrous masses of compacting DNA. Chromatin fibers were found to be slightly thicker in extracts made from antisense-injected oocytes (compare panels a and c). However, the assembly of fully compact, individualized chromosomes occurred with the same efficiency in both extracts (compare panels b and d). Interestingly, in some experiments, the individualization of chromosomes was even more efficient in extracts made from antisense-injected oocytes. These observations indicate that chromosome assembly is not impaired in extracts made from XCAP-D2 knocked-down oocytes. Chromosome-associated Proteins in Extracts Made from XCAP-D2 Knocked-down Oocytes—A possible interpretation of the above observations is that XCAP-D2 is not required for chromosome assembly in mitotic extracts. However, due to residual XCAP-D2, it cannot be ruled out that even in extracts made from antisense-injected oocytes the amount of XCAP-D2 loaded onto chromosomes remains unchanged. To test this hypothesis, mitotic extracts were made from injected oocytes and incubated with sperm chromatin. After 2 h of incubation, free and chromatin-bound proteins were separated by centrifugation through a 30% sucrose cushion (Fig. 6). Preliminary experiments showed that, in the absence of oocyte extracts, purified sperm chromatin contai"
