https://openalex.org/W2099631417,"Stroke is a leading cause of disability, but no pharmacological therapy is currently available for promoting recovery. The brain region adjacent to stroke damage-the peri-infarct zone-is critical for rehabilitation, as it shows heightened neuroplasticity, allowing sensorimotor functions to re-map from damaged areas. Thus, understanding the neuronal properties constraining this plasticity is important for the development of new treatments. Here we show that after a stroke in mice, tonic neuronal inhibition is increased in the peri-infarct zone. This increased tonic inhibition is mediated by extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors and is caused by an impairment in GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid) transporter (GAT-3/GAT-4) function. To counteract the heightened inhibition, we administered in vivo a benzodiazepine inverse agonist specific for α5-subunit-containing extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors at a delay after stroke. This treatment produced an early and sustained recovery of motor function. Genetically lowering the number of α5- or δ-subunit-containing GABA(A) receptors responsible for tonic inhibition also proved beneficial for recovery after stroke, consistent with the therapeutic potential of diminishing extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptor function. Together, our results identify new pharmacological targets and provide the rationale for a novel strategy to promote recovery after stroke and possibly other brain injuries."

They are evolutionarily related to the Drosophila HP1 (dHP1) and Pc (dPc) proteins that are key components of chromatin-associated complexes capable of recognizing repressive marks such as trimethylated Lys-9 and Lys-27, respectively, on histone H3. However, the binding specificity and function of the human homologs, Cbx1–8, remain unclear. To this end we employed structural, biophysical, and mutagenic approaches to characterize the molecular determinants of sequence contextual methyllysine binding to human Cbx1–8 proteins. Although all three human HP1 homologs (Cbx1, -3, -5) replicate the structural and binding features of their dHP counterparts, the five Pc homologs (Cbx2, -4, -6, -7, -8) bind with lower affinity to H3K9me3 or H3K27me3 peptides and are unable to distinguish between these two marks. Additionally, peptide permutation arrays revealed a greater sequence tolerance within the Pc family and suggest alternative nonhistone sequences as potential binding targets for this class of chromodomains. Our structures explain the divergence of peptide binding selectivity in the Pc subfamily and highlight previously unrecognized features of the chromodomain that influence binding and specificity.

Drosophila heterochromatin protein 1 Drosophila polycomb protein polycomb repressive complex 1 chromobox proteins SET domain bifurcated-1. In mammals the dPc and dHP1 homologs have expanded to five (Cbx2, -4, -6, -7, -8) and three (Cbx1, -3, -5) proteins, respectively. Each human/mouse Cbx contains one chromodomain with ∼55–65% sequence identity to dHP1 or dPc (8Whitcomb S.J. Basu A. Allis C.D. Bernstein E. Trends Genet. 2007; 23: 494-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). A characteristic feature of the chromodomain is the positioning of the mono-, di-, and trimethylammonium moiety within a pocket lined with aromatic residues, often supplemented by one or more acidic side chains (9Taverna S.D. Li H. Ruthenburg A.J. Allis C.D. Patel D.J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 1025-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar). Despite the similarity in overall structure, the peptide binding grooves of the dHP1 and dPc chromodomains show distinct features. Each protein reveals clear discrimination for its cognate site via recognition of different residues upstream of each ARKS motif in H3 that are complementary to differences in the binding grooves of the chromodomains (1Fischle W. Wang Y. Jacobs S.A. Kim Y. Allis C.D. Khorasanizadeh S. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1870-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). Although the exact cellular role of each Cbx protein has not been defined, many of the Cbx proteins play important roles in human development and disease. Cbx1, -3, and -5 are important for formation of, and gene repression in heterochromatin. Cbx2, -4, -6, -7, and -8 are components of Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1), a key regulator of developmental genes. Mutation of Cbx2 was shown to affect human sexual development (10Biason-Lauber A. Konrad D. Meyer M. DeBeaufort C. Schoenle E.J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2009; 84: 658-663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Finally, Cbx7 has been implicated in the development of leukemia (11Scott C.L. Gil J. Hernando E.

The chromodomains of Cbx proteins are thought to, at least in part, localize the proteins and their respective complexes to appropriately marked sites of the epigenome via recognition of histone H3 trimethylated at either Lys-9 or Lys-27. A number of studies have been conducted to decipher the specificity within the Cbx family of proteins. Bernstein et al. (15Bernstein E. Duncan E.M. Masui O. Gil J. Heard E. Allis C.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 2560-2569Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar) have investigated five mouse dPc homologs (Cbx2, -4, -6, -7, -8) and showed that despite a high degree of conservation, the chromodomains display significant differences in histone peptide binding preferences. Not all dPc homologs bind preferentially to H3K27me3 as might be expected based on dPc specificity (15Bernstein E. Duncan E.M. Masui O. Gil J. Heard E. Allis C.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 2560-2569Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Cbx2 and Cbx7 recognized both H3K9me3 and H3K27me3, whereas Cbx4 preferred H3K9me3. Recently, Vincenz and Kerppola (16Vincenz C. Kerppola T.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 16572-16577Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) studied the Pc family of Cbx proteins in ES cells and fibroblasts and observed that the ability of various Cbx proteins to bind chromatin was mediated by non-conserved regions of the protein. Using bimolecular fluorescence complementation experiments, they demonstrated that neither the chromodomains nor H3K27me3 was required for targeting of Cbx proteins to chromatin in vivo. More recently, Yap et al. (17Yap K.L. Li S. Muñoz-Cabello A.M. Raguz S. Zeng L. Mujtaba S. Gil J. Walsh M.J. Zhou M.M. Mol. Cell. 2010; 38: 662-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar) showed that Cbx7 employs overlapping yet distinct regions within its chromodomain for binding H3K27me3 and RNA. Collectively, these studies show that related chromodomain binding motifs have differences in binding characteristics and highlight the need to carefully analyze the differences between mammalian and fly chromodomain-containing proteins as well as differences within mammalian chromodomain subfamilies. In the present study we sought to understand in detail the biochemical and structural basis for histone mark recognition and discrimination among the human Cbx chromodomain protein family. We measured the binding affinities of all human Cbx chromodomains for H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 and determined the three-dimensional structures (by NMR or x-ray crystallography) of several chromodomains in complex with the modified histone peptides to elucidate the structural determinants for the specificity. The human HP1 homologs Cbx1, -3, and -5 preferentially recognize H3K9me3 in a manner similar to their dHP1 counterpart with dissociation constants in the low micromolar range. On the other hand, chromodomains from the human Pc homologs all have lower affinities for H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 peptides, do not distinguish well between these two marks, and are less sensitive to mutations within the peptide sequence. Our structural data show that the primary origin of the difference between human HP1 and Pc chromodomains lies in their respective electrostatic surfaces. Cbx1, -3, and -5 all have a large electronegative peptide binding surface that complements the basic histone peptides, whereas Cbx2, -4, -6, -7, and -8 have a much more hydrophobic surface. Further peptide array and binding studies suggest that at least some of the human Pc chromodomains bind nonhistone sequences in a methylation-dependent manner. These data suggest that Pc-class Cbx proteins may use their chromodomains to couple PRC1 complexes with novel binding partners or chromatin sites in the mammalian genome. Chromodomains of Cbx1-(20–73), Cbx2-(9–66), Cbx3-(29–81), Cbx4-(8–65), Cbx5-(18–75), Cbx6-(8–65), Cbx7-(8–62), and Cbx8-(8–61) were overexpressed as N-terminal His6-tagged proteins at 15 °C using Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) Codon plus RIL (Stratagene) as a host organism. For purification, cells were lysed by passing through Microfluidizer (Microfluidics Corp.) at 18,000 p.s.i. The purification procedure comprises of two chromatographic steps, an affinity chromatography on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid chelating column (Qiagen) and a gel filtration Superdex 75 column (26/60, GE Healthcare). The His6 tag was cleaved with tobacco etch virus protease (except for Cbx6, which has a thrombin cutting site) after the affinity column step while dialyzing against 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl, and 1 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine. Protein for NMR samples was prepared as follows. The bacteria were grown in M9-defined medium supplemented with [15N]ammonium chloride (0.8 g/liter) and d-[13C6]glucose (0.4 g/liter) for 13C,15N-labeled samples at room temperature. These highly expressed proteins were purified by Talon (BD Biosciences) affinity chromatography under native conditions and eluted with buffer containing 500 mm Imidazole. The proteins were treated with tobacco etch virus protease and further purified by size exclusion chromatography using a HiLoad 26/60 Superdex-75 column (GE Healthcare). The proteins were monomeric in solution as determined by size exclusion chromatography. The final NMR samples were prepared in buffer containing 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.5 mm PMSF for Cbx3 complexes and 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, 1 mm benzamidine, and 0.5 mm PMSF for Cbx7 complexes. Protein-peptide complexes were prepared for NMR by titrating aliquots of unlabeled peptide into the labeled chromodomains of Cbx3 and Cbx7 in molar ratios 1:1, 1:3 (for Cbx3/K9me3), and 1:5 (for Cbx7/K27me3 and Cbx7/K9me3) until no further changes in chemical shifts were detected in the 1H,15N heteronuclear single quantum correlation spectrum. H3K9Me3 (ARTKQTARK(me3)STGGKA), H3K9Me3T6A (ARTKQAARK(me3)STGGKA), H3K27Me3 (QLATKAARK(me3)SAPATG), and H3K27Me3A24T (QLATKTARK(me3)SAPATG) were synthesized, N-terminal-labeled with fluorescein, and purified by Tufts University Core Services (Boston, MA). Binding assays were performed in a 10-μl volume at a constant labeled peptide concentration of 40 nm, and Cbx protein concentrations at saturation ranging from 800 to 1300 μm in buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm PMSF, and 0.01% Tween 20. Fluorescence polarization assays were performed in 384-well plates using a Synergy 2 microplate reader (BioTek). The excitation wavelength of 485 nm and the emission wavelength of 528 nm were used. The data were corrected for background of the free labeled peptides. To determine Kd values, the data were fit to a hyperbolic function using Sigma Plot software (Systat Software, Inc., CA). The Kd values represent averages ± S.E. for at least three independent experiments. Peptides were synthesized directly on a modified cellulose membrane with a polyethylglycol linker using the peptide synthesizer MultiPep (Intavis). The degenerate screening peptide library consisted of 520 membrane-immobilized peptides corresponding to control peptides and 13-residue-long stretches of histone H3 sequences corresponding to residues 3–15 and 21–33. The lysine at positions 9 and 27 was always trimethylated, whereas flanking residues were systematically mutated to each of the 20 l-amino acids. The binding assay was performed as described previously (18Nady N. Min J. Kareta M.S. Chédin F. Arrowsmith C.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2008; 33: 305-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Briefly, the membrane was extensively blocked with skim milk, incubated overnight with 5 μm His6-tagged protein of interest, washed with PBS/Tween, and visualized via Western blot analysis with an anti-His antibody (Abcam). All complex structures have been determined using the ABACUS approach (19Lemak A. Steren C.A. Arrowsmith C.H. Llinás M. J. Biomol. NMR. 2008; 41: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) from NMR data collected at high resolution from nonlinearly sampled spectra and processed using multidimensional decomposition (20Gutmanas A.

NMR spectra were recorded at 25 °C on Varian INOVA 500-MHz spectrometer equipped with triple resonance cold probe and Bruker Avance 600 and 800-MHz spectrometers equipped with cryoprobes. The sequence-specific assignment of 13C, 1H, and 15N resonances were assigned using the ABACUS protocol (19Lemak A. Steren C.A. Arrowsmith C.H. Llinás M. J. Biomol. NMR. 2008; 41: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) from peak lists derived from manually peak picked spectra. The restraints for backbone φ and ψ torsion angles were derived from chemical shifts of backbone atoms using TALOS (22Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol.

Mumenthaler C. Wüthrich K. J. Mol.

The resonances of free and bound histone peptides were assigned from two-dimensional total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY) and NOESY experiments. Intermolecular NOEs were assigned from a three-dimensional 13C,15N-filtered, -edited NOESY spectrum (39Zwahlen C. Pascale L. Vincent S.J.F. Greenblatt J. Konrat R. Kay L.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 6711-6721Crossref Scopus (537) Google Scholar) of 13C,15N-labeled protein bound to unlabeled peptide. A subset of unambiguous NOEs between peptide and protein were initially assigned manually and were sufficient to dock each peptide to the respective protein in CYANA calculations. Next, additional intermolecular NOEs were assigned based on knowledge of the residues expected to be in close proximity between protein and peptide (supplemental Figs. S6 and S7). The final 20 lowest-energy structures were refined within CNS (24Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J.

After refinement, 99.4 and 0.6% residues in Cbx3/K9me3, 95.7 and 4.3% residues in Cbx7/K9me3, and 94.4 and 5.6% residues in Cbx7/K27me3 were in favorable and allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. All NOE distance and angular restraints are deposited with the atomic coordinates in the PDB. Figures were prepared using MOLMOL (26Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol.

Crystals of the Cbx chromodomains were grown at 18 °C using the sitting-drop method by mixing equal volumes of the mother liquor with protein solutions. Crystallization conditions for individual structures are shown in supplemental Table S2. All diffraction data were collected at 100 K and reduced with the HKL2000 suite of programs. The crystal structures of these Cbx chromodomains and their complexes with histone peptides were solved by molecular replacement using MOLREP. COOT (28Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

To elucidate the binding specificity for the chromodomains of human Cbx proteins, we measured the affinity of the recombinant chromodomains for both trimethylated Lys-9 and Lys-27 marks on histone H3 peptides using fluorescence polarization. Modified and mutant peptide sequences were assayed with each chromodomain (Table 1). Similar to dHP1, the human HP1 homologs (Cbx1, -3, -5) showed significant preference for H3K9me3 peptides (31Vermeulen M. Eberl H.C. Matarese F. Marks H. Denissov S. Butter F. Lee K.K. Olsen J.V. Hyman A.A. Stunnenberg H.G. Mann M.

In contrast, most human Pc homologs (Cbx2, -4, -6, -7, -8) had a wide range of affinities toward both marks without a distinct selectivity for one, similar to their mouse homologs (15Bernstein E.

Cbx4 and Cbx7 bound to both methylated marks but behaved more like a HP1 protein with modest binding to H3K9me3 and 2–3-fold weaker binding to H3K27me3. In fact, Cbx2 was the only Pc-like chromodomain with a clear preference for the K27me3 mark; however, the affinity was rather low. Furthermore, Cbx2, -4, and -7 were insensitive to mutation of the third residue upstream of methyllysine (Thr-6 or Ala-24). Finally, neither Cbx6 nor Cbx8 bound to K9me3 or K27me3 very weakly, with Kd values >500 μm.TABLE 1Peptide binding specificity of human Cbx proteinsProteinKdpeptideH3K9me3H3K9me3T6AH3K27me3H3K27me3A24TμmCBX15 ± 245 ± 20N/BN/BCBX2>500N/B185 ± 20330 ± 50CBX315 ± 8N/BN/BN/BCBX470 ± 780 ± 8205 ± 20250 ± 50CBX530 ± 5N/BN/BN/BCBX6>500N/B>500>500CBX755 ± 5140 ± 15110 ± 17210 ± 50CBX8>500N/B>500>500 Open table in a new tab Because the human Cbx binding specificity does not correspond closely to the prototypical Drosophila specificities of HP1 and Pc proteins (2Jacobs S.A.

Min J. Kareta M.S. Chédin F. Arrowsmith C.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2008; 33: 305-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Peptide arrays were synthesized for two sets of peptides from histone H3 covering residues 3–15 and 21–33 with trimethylated lysine (Kme3) at positions Lys-9 or -27, respectively. These two sequences were systematically mutated to each of the 20 amino acids (Fig. 1, vertical series) at each position of the peptide (Fig. 1, horizontal series). Binding was then assessed for representative HP1-like (Cbx3) and Pc-like (Cbx7 and Cbx8) chromodomains. As expected, Cbx3 chromodomain bound to H3K9me3 but not to H3K27me3-related peptides, whereas Cbx7 showed binding to both with an absolute dependence on trimethylation of Lys-9 or Lys-27 for both chromodomains (Fig. 1, A and B). Cbx8 showed binding to H3K27me3-related peptides only (Fig. 1C). Variations of the ARKS motif shared by both sequences were not tolerated for either protein except for mutations of the arginine residue to hydrophobic residues. This suggests that the hydrophobic side chain of arginine within ARKS contributes to the binding energy as opposed to its guanidino group, which points away from the interaction surface. Consistent with its similarity to dHP1 and the data in Table 1, Cbx3 binding was disrupted by most mutations of Gln-5 and Thr-6 residues upstream of the ARKS motif of H3 (5Jacobs S.A. Khorasanizadeh S. Science. 2002; 295: 2080-2083Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). On the other hand, many but not all mutations of Gln-5 and Thr-6 were tolerated by Cbx7, again demonstrating less sensitivity to residues in this region of the peptide. These screens confirmed that the binding event is driven primarily by the ARKS motif with little or no contribution from the C-terminal residues for either protein. To better understand how human Cbx chromodomains recognize their substrates, we determined the structures of Cbx2, -3, -5, -6, -7, and -8 with a combination of solution NMR and x-ray crystallography including (where possible) complexes with H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 peptides. Analysis of the structures confirmed that they have a common overall fold and bind trimethyllysine-containing peptides in a manner similar to their Drosophila homologs. In all Cbx structures, the trimethylammonium moiety is positioned within an aromatic cage consisting of three aromatic residues supplemented by one or two acidic residues and the remaining peptide binds with a surface-groove recognition mode (9Taverna S.D. Li H. Ruthenburg A.J. Allis C.D. Patel D.J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 1025-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar). Two key elements of the peptide binding groove that are conserved among all Cbx proteins are 1) the extended β-strand conformation of the peptide forming a continuous β-sheet with the protein, and 2) a conserved binding pocket for the Ala residue at the −2 position in the peptide substrate relative to the trimethyllysine. For all Cbx histone peptide complexes, this Ala (histone residues Ala-7 or Ala-25) is buried in a small hydrophobic pocket, the size of which is sufficient to accommodate an alanine side chain but nothing larger. This explains the absolute requirement for Ala at the −2 position of the peptide as seen for the Drosophila proteins. As previously reported for dHP1(5,7) and shown above for the human homologs, Thr-6 of the H3 peptide is an important determinant of the binding and selectivity of the HP1 class of chromodomains. T6V is the only mutation at peptide residue Lys-3 that is capable of interacting with Cbx3 (Fig. 1A). Comparison of the complex structures of Cbx3 and Cbx5 suggests an important role of two conserved negatively charged residues or “polar fingers.” The fingers are formed by a pair of residues Glu-29/19 (top) and Asp-68/58 (bottom) of Cbx3 and Cbx5 chromodomains, respectively, whose β and γ methylene groups are sandwiched by the side chains of Thr-6 and Arg-8 of the peptide (Figs. 2C and 3). Importantly, only valine, which is similar in size to threonine but has a methyl instead of hydroxyl group, would allow the acidic polar fingers to adopt a similar conformation. This is noteworthy because the position of the “top” finger (i.e. Glu-29/19) is important for the conformation of the subsequent residue (Phe-30/20), which contributes to the formation of the methylysine binding aromatic cage. Mutation of the polar clasp residues of Cbx3 to the corresponding residues found in the human Pc homologs (Glu-29 to Val and Asp-68 to Leu) dramatically reduced binding of Cbx3 to both H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 peptides (supplemental Table S4). Thus, a key feature of the HP1 class-peptide interactions is not a specific interaction with Thr-6 per se but, rather, the favorable polar clasp that only Thr (or Val) in this position allows.FIGURE 3Selectivity of human HP1 homologs is driven by polar fingers. Surface representations are shown of the polar fingers for Cbx3 (left) and Cbx5 chromodomains (right) in complex with H3K9me3 peptide. Thr-6 and Arg-8 residues of the peptide are shown in the binding cleft. The β and γ methylene groups of conserved polar fingers are sandwiched by side chains of Thr-6 and Arg-8. The right panel is rotated by 90° with respect to the left panel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In addition, Gln-5 also seems to contribute to the binding specificity albeit to a lesser extent than Thr-6 (Fig. 1A). This residue makes main-chain interactions with Val-32 of Cbx3 and interacts with the N terminus of the chromodomain α-helix. At this position only medium sized polar residues such as Asn, Cys, Gln, and His are tolerated. Overall, our binding data indicate that Cbx1, -3, and -5 bind with greater affinity to H3K9me3 than the Pc orthologs bind to either peptides. We attribute the stronger binding affinity of human HP1 homo"

Runguphan et al. remedy that omission by introducing the biosynthetic machinery responsible for chlorination in soil bacteria into the genome of the periwinkle, Catharanthus roseus. The prokaryotic halogenases function within the plant cells to generate chlorinated tryptophan, which is then utilized by the monoterpene indole alkaloid metabolic pathways to yield chlorinated alkaloids. Halogen atoms have been observed in several different classes of natural product, but very few halogenated natural products have been isolated from terrestrial plants. These authors show that biosynthetic machinery responsible for chlorination events in bacteria could be introduced into the medicinal plant Catharanthus roseus. Prokaryotic halogenases function within the plant cells to generate chlorinated tryptophan, which is then used by the monoterpene indole alkaloid metabolic pathways to yield chlorinated alkaloids. Halogenation, which was once considered a rare occurrence in nature, has now been observed in many natural product biosynthetic pathways1. However, only a small fraction of halogenated compounds have been isolated from terrestrial plants2. Given the impact that halogenation can have on the biological activity of natural products1, we reasoned that the introduction of halides into medicinal plant metabolism would provide the opportunity to rationally bioengineer a broad variety of novel plant products with altered, and perhaps improved, pharmacological properties. Here we report that chlorination biosynthetic machinery from soil bacteria can be successfully introduced into the medicinal plant Catharanthus roseus (Madagascar periwinkle). These prokaryotic halogenases function within the context of the plant cell to generate chlorinated tryptophan, which is then shuttled into monoterpene indole alkaloid metabolism to yield chlorinated alkaloids. A new functional group—a halide—is thereby introduced into the complex metabolism of C. roseus, and is incorporated in a predictable and regioselective manner onto the plant alkaloid products. Medicinal plants, despite their genetic and developmental complexity, therefore seem to be a viable platform for synthetic biology efforts."

We aimed at identifying expression patterns of inflammatory and immune response genes specifically associated with obesity and NASH in the liver of morbidly obese patients. Methodology/Principal Findings Expression of 222 genes was evaluated by quantitative RT-PCR in the liver of morbidly obese patients with histologically normal liver (n = 6), or with severe steatosis without (n = 6) or with NASH (n = 6), and in lean controls (n = 5). Hepatic expression of 58 out of 222 inflammatory and immune response genes was upregulated in NASH patients. The most notable changes occurred in genes encoding chemokines and chemokine receptors involved in leukocyte recruitment, CD and cytokines involved in the T cell activation towards a Th1 phenotype, and immune semaphorins. This regulation seems to be specific for the liver since visceral adipose tissue expression and serum levels of MCP1, IP10, TNFα and IL6 were not modified. Importantly, 47 other genes were already upregulated in histologically normal liver (e.g. CRP, Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathway). Interestingly, serum palmitate, known to activate the TLR pathway, was increased with steatosis. Conclusion/Significance The liver of obese patients without histological abnormalities already displayed a low-grade inflammation and could be more responsive to activators of the TLR pathway. NASH was then characterized by a specific gene signature. These findings help to identify new potential actors of the pathogenesis of NAFLD."

https://openalex.org/W2150990505,"Vitamin D deficiency is implicated in autoimmune disease. We therefore evaluated the effects of 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25-D(3)), the active form of vitamin D, on the development of T helper 1 (Th1), Th17, and Th9 cells, which are implicated in the pathogenesis of different types of autoimmunity. 1,25-D(3) compromised the development of Th17 and Th9 cells, including IL-22-expressing cells while simultaneously increasing the frequency of IL-10-competent cells. Relative to Th17 and Th9 cells, the effects of 1,25-D(3) on Th1 cells were modest, reflecting the significantly reduced levels of the receptor for vitamin D in this lineage. The use of cells deficient in IL-10 or antibodies that block IL-10 signaling abolished the inhibitory effect of 1,25-D(3) on Th9 cells but had no effect on inhibition of Th17 cell frequencies. Thus, the induction of IL-10 in cultures of Th9 cells is an important mechanism by which 1,25-D(3) compromises Th9 development but does not explain inhibition of Th17 cells. A survey of select representatives of the Th17 transcriptome revealed that the levels of mRNA that encode RORγt, IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-23R, and IL-22, were reduced by 1,25-D(3), whereas IL-21 and aryl hydrocarbon receptor mRNA remained unchanged. These data suggest that vitamin D deficiency may promote autoimmunity by favoring the inordinate production of Th17 and Th9 cells at the expense of regulatory IL-10-producing T cells."

Here, we report that the expression of microRNA-210 (miR-210) is down-regulated in human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and derived cell lines. Marked decreases in the level of miR-210 were observed especially in poorly differentiated carcinomas. We found that miR-210 inhibits cancer cell survival and proliferation by inducing cell death and cell cycle arrest in G(1)/G(0) and G(2)/M. Finally, we identified fibroblast growth factor receptor-like 1 (FGFRL1) as a target of miR-210 in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and demonstrated that FGFRL1 accelerates cancer cell proliferation by preventing cell cycle arrest in G(1)/G(0). Taken together, our findings show an important role for miR-210 as a tumor-suppressive microRNA with effects on cancer cell proliferation."

We found these results surprising, and performed this study to determine whether 30% CR does induce an increase in mitochondria in heart, brain, liver, adipose tissue, and/or skeletal muscle. To this end, we measured the levels of a range of mitochondrial proteins, and mRNAs. With the exception of long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase protein level, which was increased ~60% in adipose tissue, none of the mitochondrial proteins or mRNAs that we measured were increased in rats subjected to 30% CR for 14 wk. There was also no increase in citrate synthase activity. Because it is not possible to have an increase in mitochondria without any increase in key mitochondrial proteins, we conclude that 30% CR does not induce an increase in mitochondria in heart, brain, liver, adipose tissue, or skeletal muscle in laboratory rodents.—Hancock, C.

The hybrid gene transcript, dupα7, has been identified in brain, immune cells, and the HL-60 cell line, although its translation and function are still unknown. In this study, dupα7 cDNA has been cloned and expressed in GH4C1 cells and Xenopus oocytes to study the pattern and functional role of the expressed protein. Our results reveal that dupα7 transcript was natively translated in HL-60 cells and heterologously expressed in GH4C1 cells and oocytes. Injection of dupα7 mRNA into oocytes failed to generate functional receptors, but when co-injected with α7 mRNA at α7/dupα7 ratios of 5:1, 2:1, 1:1, 1:5, and 1:10, it reduced the nicotine-elicited α7 current generated in control oocytes (α7 alone) by 26, 53, 75, 93, and 94%, respectively. This effect is mainly due to a reduction in the number of functional α7 receptors reaching the oocyte membrane, as deduced from α-bungarotoxin binding and fluorescent confocal assays. Two additional findings open the possibility that the dominant negative effect of dupα7 on α7 receptor activity observed in vitro could be extrapolated to in vivo situations.

The α7 nicotinic subunit encoded by gene CHRNA7 is located on the long arm of chromosome 15 (15q13-q14). A hybrid gene (CHRFAM7A) resulting from a fusion of a partial duplication of CHRNA7 with FAM7A gene was identified at 1.6 Mb from CHRNA7 toward the centromeric region (15Gault J. Robinson M.

In contrast, the hybrid has replaced exons 1–4 of the original CHRNA7 with the exons D, C, B, and A of FAM7A, inserted in an Alu sequence of intron 4 of CHRNA7, 700 bp upstream from exon 5. Moreover, CHRFAM7A is polymorphic with a few rare individuals who completely lack a copy of the gene. Most people (>95%) have one or two CHRFAM7A copies, and in some cases, there is a 2-bp deletion in exon 6 (16Riley B. Williamson M. Collier D. Wilkie H. Makoff A.

To obtain the whole coding sequence, the 3′-region fragment was digested with BsmBI (underlined in primers A7S4 and A7AS3) and SacI and ligated to the vector containing the 5′-region, digested with the same enzymes. The complete cDNA was transferred directly from dupα7·pMOS-Blue to pcDNA3 (digested with XbaI and BamHI). For oocyte injection experiments, dupα7 was amplified from dupα7·pMOS-Blue with DupSpeI(S) 5′-ACTAGTGCCACCATGCAAAAATATTGCATCTACC-3′ and DupNotI(AS) 5′-GCGGCCGCCGTGGTTACGCAAAGTCTTTGG-3′ (with the recognition sequences for SpeI and NotI underlined, respectively) and cloned into pSP64T digested with the same enzymes. Techniques for RNA isolation from cells and tissues and in vitro transcription mRNA synthesis have been described elsewhere (31Solís-Garrido L.M. Pintado A.J. Andrés-Mateos E. Figueroa M. Matute C.

Plasmids dupα7·pSP64T, α7·pSP64T, and RIC3·pGEMH19 were linearized with BamHI, Xba, and NheI, respectively, and then transcribed in vitro with SP6 (dupα7, α7) or T7 (RIC3) polymerases using the mMACHINE kit from Ambion (Austin, TX). Messenger RNA was dissolved in RNase-free water (1 μg/μl), and aliquots were stored at −80 °C until used. GH4C1 cells were electroporated with plasmids dupα7·pcDNA3, α7·pcDNA3, or pcDNA3. They were then plated on 12-mm glass coverslips for 48 h before processing. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100, and stained overnight with the monoclonal anti-α7 subunit antibody (Mab306, Sigma, 1:3000) in PBS with 5% normal goat serum at 4 °C, followed by incubation with AlexaFluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (1:400) for 2 h at room temperature. All images were captured with a Leica TCS SP2 spectral confocal laser scanning microscope as reported previously (31Solís-Garrido L.M. Pintado A.J. Andrés-Mateos E. Figueroa M. Matute C. Montiel C.

Fluorescence intensity, expressed as arbitrary units, was measured in a narrow region of interest (ROI) located between the plasma membrane and the cell nucleus. In other cases, fluorescence intensity was measured along the x axis of the entire cell body. Techniques for mRNA injection and immunodetection of foreign proteins expressed in intact injected oocytes have been described elsewhere (31Solís-Garrido L.M. Pintado A.J. Andrés-Mateos E.

Five days after injection, protein expression was analyzed using the same antibodies and dilutions as for GH4C1 cells. Oocytes were mounted in glycerol/buffer (70:30) under a glass coverslip on a glass dual-well slide. The slide was fastened upside down on the stage of the Leica confocal microscope and visualized with a ×20 lens. The fluorescent signal was determined as arbitrary units in an ROI located on the surface of the animal pole of the oocyte. Native expression levels of functional α7 nAChRs in MØ were analyzed using fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled α-bungarotoxin (FITC-αBgtx) and confocal microscopy. Cells were incubated with FITC-αBgtx (3μg·ml−1; Sigma) as described previously (34Wang H. Yu M. Ochani M. Amella C.A. Tanovic M. Susarla S. Li J.H. Wang H. Yang H. Ulloa L. Al-Abed Y. Czura C.J.

Cells from the same culture incubated with nicotine (500 μm) or αBgtx (1 μm), before and during the addition of FITC-αBgtx, were used as a negative control. After several rinses, MØ were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, washed, and mounted on coverslips. Heterologous expression of functional α7 nAChRs in mRNA-injected oocytes was analyzed 5 days after injection by incubation with FITC-αBgtx (3 μg·ml−1) in Barth's solution, as has been described for MØ. Oocytes were rinsed, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, mounted in glycerol/buffer (70:30), and visualized by confocal microscopy.

The agonist concentration eliciting half-maximal current (EC50) and the Hill coefficient values were estimated through nonlinear regression analysis using the four-parameter logistic equation of the GraphPad Prism software. Total surface expression of αBgtx-binding sites on the surface of mRNA-injected oocytes was assayed with 125I-α Bgtx (Amersham Biosciences), as described elsewhere (36García-Guzmán M. Sala F. Sala S. Campos-Caro A. Criado M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15198-15203Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 days after injection, oocytes placed on 24-well plates were preincubated for 15 min with Ringer's solution containing fetal calf serum (6%). Then they were incubated for 2 h at 18 °C in a final volume of 300 μl of the above solution containing increasing concentrations (1–10 nm) of 125I-α Bgtx. After incubation, labeled medium was removed and oocytes washed several times with Ringer's solution before counting total bound radioactivity in a Beckman Coulter γ counter. Nonspecific binding was determined in noninjected oocytes incubated under the same conditions; this value was subtracted from total binding to yield specific binding. Poly(A)+ RNAs (4 μg/lane) isolated from human CTX and from HL-60 cells were separated by 1% formaldehyde/agarose gel electrophoresis, transferred onto a nylon blotting membrane (Schleicher & Schuell), and hybridized at 68 °C overnight with the 32P-labeled probe (781 bp) obtained by digestion of dupα7·pMOS-Blue with SpeI and SmaI. The resulting fragment starts in the ATG of exon B and extends to the 51st nucleotide of exon 10; thus, it recognizes the dupα7 and α7 transcripts. Polysome-bound mRNA from HL-60 cells was obtained as described by del Prete et al. (37del Prete M.J. Vernal R. Dolznig H. Müllner E.W. Garcia-Sanz J.A. RNA. 2007; 13: 414-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), except that cells were pretreated with 0.1 mg·ml−1 cycloheximide for 10 min at 37 °C. In the conditions used, ribonucleoprotein particles, isolated ribosomal subunits, and monosomes remain in fractions 1–10 (from the top) whereas polysomes are recovered in fractions 11–20. After this, monosomic and polysome fractions were regrouped into two pools, and 1 aliquot (10 μl, diluted to 100 ng·μl−1) from each pool was used for Q-PCR mRNA quantification. We added 10 ng of in vitro transcribed luciferase mRNA (from pGL3-control plasmid) to each aliquot as an endogenous marker for quantification. The level of gene expression in human CTX and human MØ was also assessed by Q-PCR for reverse-transcribed mRNA or total RNA, respectively. A combination of TaqMan and SYBR Green-based assays for amplicon detection on the ABI Prism 7900 device was used. The following primers were used: for dupα7, forward 5′-CAATTGCTAATCCAGCATTTGT-3′ (position 603–624 of sequence in NM_139320) and reverse 5′-CCCAGAAGAATTCACCAACACG-3′ (position 704–683 in NM_139320); for α7, Hs_CHRNA7_2_SG, QuantiTech Primer Assay, QT01681211 (Qiagen); for TBP (encoding for the TATA-binding protein), forward 5′-CGGTTTGCTGCGGTAATCA-3′ and reverse 5′-TGTTGGTGGGTGAGCAC-AAG-3′; for luciferase, forward 5′-TGGAAGACGCCAAAAACATAAAG-3′ and reverse 5′-AGCAATTGTTCCAGGAACCAGGGC-3′. For dupα7 and α7 mRNA quantification in MØ, TaqMan Hs00415199_m1 and Hs01063372_m1 (Applied Biosystems) were used, respectively. Analysis of the melting curves demonstrated that each pair of primers amplified a single product. Q-PCR for each mRNA was performed in triplicate, and all results were normalized to the expression of 18 S rRNA (Ambion primers). Relative gene expression values were calculated by the comparative ΔCt method using the Sequence Detection System 1.2 software (Applied Biosystems). Unless otherwise indicated, all products were purchased from Sigma. AlexaFluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR), and DMEM and RPMI media were from Invitrogen. The human recombinant IL-1β was purchased from PeproTech (London, UK), and PNU120596 was from Tocris Bioscience (Bristol, UK). The cloned full-length dupα7 cDNA codes for a 1236-nucleotide sequence similar to the one previously deposited in NCBI and that corresponds to the dupα7 isoform 1 (accession number NM_139320) with minimal variations. Our sequence contains two neutral transitions, C/T and A/G at positions 654 and 986, respectively, but it retains the two TG nucleotides at positions 497–498 on exon 6. Using the ConPred II software for transmembrane topology prediction, one can observe that the resulting 412-amino acid polypeptide preserves many of the distinctive features of the nAChR subunits, with the N and C termini outside the membrane and the four transmembrane domains (M1–M4) as well as the long intracellular loop between M3 and M4 (Fig. 2A). However, as has been reported previously (15Gault J. Robinson M. Berger R. Drebing C. Logel J. Hopkins J. Moore T. Jacobs S. Meriwether J. Choi M.J. Kim E.J. Walton K. Buiting K. Davis A. Breese C. Freedman R. Leonard S. Genomics. 1998; 52: 173-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), dupα7 protein does lose a substantial part of the long N-terminal domain of α7 and thus lacks the recognition sites for ACh and α Bgtx. Expression of foreign proteins was analyzed in GH4C1 cells transfected with plasmids dupα7·pcDNA3 or α7·pcDNA3 and in oocytes injected with dupα7 and α7 mRNAs. The GH4C1 cell line was selected for two reason. 1) It does not express dupα7 or α7, making visualization of foreign protein expression feasible. 2) It expresses the RIC-3 chaperone (38Sweileh W. Wenberg K. Xu J. Forsayeth J. Hardy S. Loring R.H. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 75: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) making it an excellent model to express functional α7 nAChRs. The confocal images obtained in transfected GH4C1 cells stained with Mab306 show a high expression level of both proteins, in contrast to low fluorescence detected in the negative control cells transfected with pcDNA3 (Fig. 1, A and C). The analysis of the protein expression along the x axis of the cell reveals two expression peaks located in the cell periphery; the α7 peak seems to be located more externally than the dupα7 peak (Fig. 1B). Noninjected oocytes (control) have low basal fluorescence, which increases markedly at or near the cell surface of the animal hemisphere in dupα7 or α7 mRNA-injected oocytes incubated with the above antibody (Fig. 2B). Nevertheless, the fluorescence signal corresponding to dupα7 is significantly lower (33 ± 7%, n = 7; p ≤ 0.05) than that found in α7 mRNA-injected oocytes. As has been reported previously, no intracellular fluorescence was observed in mRNA-injected oocytes under any experimental condition (39Balduzzi R. Cupello A. Diaspro A. Ramoino P. Robello M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1539: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). This may be due to the following: 1) the inability of the laser to penetrate far into a large 1-mm cell; 2) the quenching of the fluorescent signal by the oocyte yolk/pigment; or 3) the possibility that intracellular antibody distribution may be too diffuse to be detected. Once the heterologous expression of the dupα7 protein in GH4C1 cells and oocytes was confirmed, we proceeded to study its possible functional role in the latter cell type. The study began with the electrophysiological recording of ACh-elicited currents (IACh) in oocytes injected with α7 mRNA (2.5 ng/oocyte). In all experiments RIC3 mRNA (2.5 ng) was co-injected with α7 mRNA because this treatment almost doubles the amplitude and reproducibility of the recorded currents. Repeated pulses of ACh (100 μm, 1 s) or nicotine (30 μm, 1 s) at 1-min intervals, applied to oocytes injected with increasing concentrations of dupα7 mRNA (from 0.5 to 25 ng/oocyte), failed to produce any response (not shown). In contrast, co-injection of dupα7 with α7 mRNA (2.5 ng) resulted in a concentration-dependent reduction of α7 current induced by nicotine (INic) (Fig. 3, A and B). The co-injection of 0.5 ng/oocyte of dupα7 mRNA (α7/dupα7 ratio of 5:1) was sufficient to reduce significantly (26 ± 8%, n = 6; p ≤ 0.01) the amplitude of INic, and this blockade exceeded 90% when the α7/dupα7 ratio was 1:5 or 1:10. The next experiments were designed to analyze the nature of the dominant negative effect of dupα7 on the α7 current. One possibility is that dupα7 is integrated into the pentameric structure of the expressed receptor, changing its pharmacological properties. Another possibility is that dupα7 interferes with the proper assembly of α7 subunits that form mature homopentameric α7 nAChR, which is essential for receptor trafficking from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the cell membrane. The following experiments sought to explore both possibilities. Fig. 3 (C and D) shows the concentration-response curves to ACh in oocytes injected with 2.5 ng of α7 mRNA and the corresponding amount of dupα7 mRNA according to the indicated α7/dupα7 ratio. Each oocyte was stimulated with successive pulses of increasing concentrations of agonist and, at the end of experiment, w"
https://openalex.org/W2052351570,"Channels and transporters of the ClC family cause the transmembrane movement of inorganic anions in service of a variety of biological tasks, from the unusual-the generation of the kilowatt pulses with which electric fish stun their prey-to the quotidian-the acidification of endosomes, vacuoles and lysosomes. The homodimeric architecture of ClC proteins, initially inferred from single-molecule studies of an elasmobranch Cl(-) channel and later confirmed by crystal structures of bacterial Cl(-)/H(+) antiporters, is apparently universal. Moreover, the basic machinery that enables ion movement through these proteins-the aqueous pores for anion diffusion in the channels and the ion-coupling chambers that coordinate Cl(-) and H(+) antiport in the transporters-are contained wholly within each subunit of the homodimer. The near-normal function of a bacterial ClC transporter straitjacketed by covalent crosslinks across the dimer interface and the behaviour of a concatemeric human homologue argue that the transport cycle resides within each subunit and does not require rigid-body rearrangements between subunits. However, this evidence is only inferential, and because examples are known in which quaternary rearrangements of extramembrane ClC domains that contribute to dimerization modulate transport activity, we cannot declare as definitive a 'parallel-pathways' picture in which the homodimer consists of two single-subunit transporters operating independently. A strong prediction of such a view is that it should in principle be possible to obtain a monomeric ClC. Here we exploit the known structure of a ClC Cl(-)/H(+) exchanger, ClC-ec1 from Escherichia coli, to design mutants that destabilize the dimer interface while preserving both the structure and the transport function of individual subunits. The results demonstrate that the ClC subunit alone is the basic functional unit for transport and that cross-subunit interaction is not required for Cl(-)/H(+) exchange in ClC transporters."
https://openalex.org/W2073392285,"Many widespread and persistent organic pollutants, e.g., 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), causing it to translocate to the cell nucleus, where it transactivates target genes. AhR's ability to target the blood-brain barrier is essentially unexplored. We show here that exposing isolated rat brain capillaries to 0.05-0.5 nM TCDD roughly doubled transport activity and protein expression of P-glycoprotein, an ATP-driven drug efflux pump and a critical determinant of drug entry into the CNS. These effects were abolished by actinomycin D or cycloheximide or by the AhR antagonists resveratrol and α-naphthoflavone. Brain capillaries from TCDD-dosed rats (1-5 μg/kg, i.p.) exhibited increased transport activity and protein expression of 3 xenobiotic efflux pumps, P-glycoprotein, multidrug resistance-associated protein 2, and breast cancer resistance polypeptide, as well as expression of Cyp1a1 and Cyp1b1, both AhR target genes. Consistent with increased P-glycoprotein expression in capillaries from TCDD-dosed rats, in situ brain perfusion indicated significantly reduced brain accumulation of verapamil, a P-glycoprotein substrate. These findings suggest a new paradigm for the field of environmental toxicology: toxicants acting through AhR to target xenobiotic efflux transporters at the blood-brain barrier and thus reduce brain accumulation of CNS-acting therapeutic drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2021827170,"Chromatin-modifying complexes such as the NuRD complex are recruited to particular genomic sites by gene-specific nuclear factors. Overall, however, little is known about the molecular basis for these interactions. Here, we present the 1.9 Å resolution crystal structure of the NuRD subunit RbAp48 bound to the 15 N-terminal amino acids of the GATA-1 cofactor FOG-1. The FOG-1 peptide contacts a negatively charged binding pocket on top of the RbAp48 β-propeller that is distinct from the binding surface used by RpAp48 to contact histone H4. We further show that RbAp48 interacts with the NuRD subunit MTA-1 via a surface that is distinct from its FOG-binding pocket, providing a first glimpse into the way in which NuRD assembly facilitates interactions with cofactors. Our RbAp48·FOG-1 structure provides insight into the molecular determinants of FOG-1-dependent association with the NuRD complex and into the links between transcription regulation and nucleosome remodeling."

Insulin signaling modulates Gsk-3 activity via the activity of upstream effectors; insulin or insulin-like growth factor binds to the insulin receptor, resulting in the activation of PI3K, which in turn phosphorylates and activates Akt (also called protein kinase B; PKB) (14.Cantley L.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1655-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (4542) Google Scholar). Akt subsequently phosphorylates several substrates, including Gsk-3 isoforms, on N-terminal serine residues (Gsk-3α Ser-21/Gsk-3β Ser-9), resulting in the inhibition of Gsk-3 activity (15.Cross D.A.

Gsk-3 activity also represents a key regulatory step in the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. In the absence of ligand, a subset of cytoplasmic Gsk-3 is found in a protein complex that facilitates Gsk-3-mediated phosphorylation of β-catenin, targeting the protein for ubiquitination and degradation via the 26 S proteasome and keeping the Wnt pathway repressed (16.MacDonald B.T. Tamai K. He X. Dev. Cell. 2009; 17: 9-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3989) Google Scholar). Upon ligand binding to the Wnt co-receptors, Gsk-3 redistributes to the cell surface (17.Zeng X. Tamai K. Doble B. Li S. Huang H. Habas R. Okamura H. Woodgett J. He X. Nature. 2005; 438: 873-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar), rendering the β-catenin destruction complex non-functional, causing the accumulation and subsequent nuclear translocation of β-catenin protein, which leads to the transcription of Wnt target genes. Although activated insulin and Wnt signaling both inhibit Gsk-3 activity, the mechanism of inhibition is distinct for each pathway; Wnt signaling does not affect insulin signaling, and insulin signaling does not activate Wnt target genes (18.Ding V.W.

Here, we present evidence of a novel role for Gsk-3 isoforms in the regulation of DNA methylation at imprinted loci in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). The de novo DNA methyltransferase, Dnmt3a2, is down-regulated in Gsk-3 double knock-out (DKO) ESCs, resulting in reduced DNA methylation and altered expression of imprinted genes. Inhibition of Gsk-3 activity with lithium mimics the effects of reducing DNA methylation in both wild-type ESCs and wild-type neural stem cells. Furthermore, inactivation of Gsk-3 via components of the insulin signaling pathway results in reduced DNA methylation at imprinted loci. Finally, microarray data reveal that N-myc mRNA is down-regulated in Gsk-3 DKO ESCs. We provide data that demonstrate that a highly conserved N-Myc binding site in the Dnmt3a2 promoter is required for normal expression, and we demonstrate that siRNA knockdown of N-Myc results in a decrease in Dnmt3a2 expression. Therefore, we have identified a novel function for Gsk-3 isoforms as key regulators of the epigenome, and our results add a new perspective on the consequences of altering Gsk-3 activity. Feeder-free wild-type, Gsk-3α−/−, Gsk-3β−/−, and Gsk-3 DKO ESCs (3.Doble B.W. Patel S. Wood G.A. Kockeritz L.K. Woodgett J.R. Dev. Cell. 2007; 12: 957-971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) were grown on gelatin-coated plates in high glucose DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (HyClone), 1× non-essential amino acids, 1× sodium pyruvate, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1× penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen), 55 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1000 units/ml ESGRO (Millipore). Media was replenished every other day. Neural stem cells were isolated from 12.5 days postcoitum embryos using NeuroCult neural stem cells (NSC) proliferation media (StemCell Technologies) following the manufacturer's protocol. Integrity of total RNA was evaluated using capillary electrophoresis (Bioanalyzer 2100, Agilent) and quantified using a Nanodrop 1000 (Nanodrop, Wilmington, DE). Following confirmation of RNA quality, Ovation™ biotin RNA amplification and labeling system (NuGen Technologies, Inc., San Carlos, CA) was used to prepare amplified, biotin-labeled cDNA from total RNA following manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, first strand cDNA was synthesized from 25 ng of total RNA using a unique first strand DNA/RNA chimeric primer and reverse transcriptase. Following double strand cDNA generation, amplification of cDNA was achieved by utilizing an isothermal DNA amplification process that involves repeated SPIA™ DNA/RNA primer binding, DNA duplication, strand displacement, and RNA cleavage. The amplified SPIA™ cDNA was purified and subjected to a two-step fragmentation and labeling process. The fragmented/biotinylated cDNA content was measured in a ND-1000 spectrophotometer, and the quality was analyzed on an RNA 6000 Nano LabChip (Agilent) using an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100. For each array, 2.2 μg of cDNA was hybridized onto the GeneChips® mouse genome 430 2.0 array (Affymetrix Inc.), which contains ∼39,000 transcripts. The sequences from which these probe sets were derived were selected from GenBank™, dbEST, and RefSeq. The sequence clusters were created from the UniGene data base (Build 107, June 2002) and then refined by analysis and comparison with the publicly available draft assembly of the mouse genome from the Whitehead Institute for Genome Research (Mouse Genome Sequencing Consortium (MGSC), April 2002). Hybridization was allowed to continue for 16 h at 45 °C followed by washing and staining of microarrays in a Fluidics Station 450 (Affymetrix Inc.). GeneChip arrays were scanned in a GeneChip Scanner 3000 (Affymetrix Inc.), and CEL files were generated from DAT files using the GeneChip® operating software (GCOS) software (Affymetrix Inc.). The probe set signals were generated using the RMA algorithm in ArrayAssist 3.4 (Stratagene) and were used to determine differential gene expression by pairwise comparisons. The genes that were altered by 2-fold either way and had a false discovery rate of <10% were sorted and used for further interpretation of the microarray data. Microarray data have been deposited in GEO (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo) under accession number GSE20015. Mouse Dnmt3a2 cDNA was subcloned into a modified pCAGEN plasmid (from Connie Cepko, Addgene plasmid 11160) with a preceding puromycin resistance gene and internal ribosomal entry site. The plasmid containing a constitutively active myristoylated mouse p110 subunit of PI3K (p110*) ((5.Takahashi K. Mitsui K. Yamanaka S. Nature. 2003; 423: 541-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar); from Shinya Yamanaka, Addgene plasmid 15689) expressed a hygromycin resistance cassette. ES cells were transfected with either the Dnmt3a2 or the p110* expression constructs with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in serum-free Opti-MEM (Invitrogen). Cells were allowed to recover in non-selective ES cell media for 24 h, after which puromycin-resistant (Dnmt3a2) or hygromycin-resistant (p110*) cells were grown in ES cell media containing 1 μg/ml puromycin or 200 μg/ml hygromycin, respectively. Puromycin/hygromycin-resistant colonies were isolated after 14 days of selection and expanded in selective media. The Dnmt3a2 promoter was cloned by PCR amplification from bacterial artificial chromosome clone 330c18 RPCI-24 library using primers described in supplemental Table S1. Amplification products were TOPO TA-cloned into pCR8GW (Invitrogen) and then transferred by LR reaction to Gateway-modified pGL3-Basic, pGLF (from Glenn Maston, University of Massachusetts). Mutagenesis of the N-Myc binding site was accomplished by using the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) (supplemental Table S1). Plasmids containing the Dnmt3a2 promoter constructs driving firefly luciferase were co-transfected into ESCs with pRL SV40 with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in serum-free Opti-MEM (Invitrogen). Cells were replated in a 24-well plate 24 h after transfection and then lysed 48 h after transfection, at which time firefly and Renilla Luciferase assays were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Biotium) in a Veritas microplate luminometer (Turner Biosystems). Three replicates were performed for each transfection. Protein expression was assayed by Western blotting. Cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (137 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40) containing protease inhibitor mixture (1:100 Sigma) and sonicated for 10 30-s pulses at 4 °C in a Bioruptor (Diagenode) on the highest setting. Lysates were electrophoresed (8–20 mg/lane) through 7.5% Tris/Tricine gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Whatman BA85) at 100 V for 1 h. Blots were blocked for 1 h with 5% milk/TBST (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.1% Tween) and incubated in primary antibody diluted in 5% milk or 5% BSA (N-Myc and c-Myc antibodies)/TBST for 16–18 h at 4 °C. Antibodies were used under the following conditions. Anti-tubulin mouse mAb clone B-5-1-2 (Sigma) was diluted 1:10,000; anti-Dnmt3a mouse mAb clone 64B1446 (IMGENEX) was diluted 1:250; and anti-GSK-3α/β mouse mAb clone 1H8 (Calbiochem), anti-phospho-GSK-3α/β (Cell Signaling antibody 9331), anti-N-Myc (Cell Signaling antibody 9405), anti-c-Myc D84C12 XP (Cell Signaling antibody 5605), anti-PI3kinase p110α subunit C73F8 (Cell Signaling antibody 4249), anti-Akt1 2H10 (Cell Signaling antibody 2967), and anti-phospho-Akt Ser-473 193H12 (Cell Signaling antibody 4058) were all used at a 1:1000 dilution. Blots were incubated in anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG HRP secondary antibody (GE Healthcare) diluted 1:5000 in 5% milk in TBST for 45 min. Proteins were visualized using ECL detection reagent (GE Healthcare). Blots were stripped in a buffer consisting of 2% SDS, 62.5 mm Tris HCl, pH 6.7, and 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol at 50 °C for 30 min followed by repeated rinsing with TBST prior to reprobing with antibody. High molecular weight genomic DNA was isolated after ESCs were washed in PBS and resuspended in lysis buffer (100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 25 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.5% SDS) and lysed 16–18 h at 55 °C. An equal volume of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol was added and gently rotated at ambient temperature for 2–3 h. DNA was precipitated with 2 volumes of ethanol and 0.1 volumes of sodium acetate, washed in 70% ethanol, and resuspended in sterile water. High molecular weight genomic DNA was digested with methylation-sensitive HpaII or methylation-insensitive MspI isoschizomers (New England Biolabs). Digested DNA was separated on 0.6% agarose in 0.5× Tris-acetate-EDTA and transferred to charged nylon membrane (Osmonics Inc.). The blot was hybridized with a [α-32P]dCTP random primed labeled (Prime-It II, Stratagene) intracisternal A particle (IAP) probe (20.Dong K.B. Maksakova I.A. Mohn F. Leung D. Appanah R. Lee S.

Appl. Theor. Electrophor. 1990; 1: 181-187PubMed Google Scholar) at 65 °C for 16 h, washed twice with 2× SSC + 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 30 min, and imaged with a Typhoon 9400 PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare). Cells were resuspended in TRIzol (Invitrogen), and RNA was isolated following the manufacturer's protocol and then further purified with the RNeasy RNA cleanup procedure (Qiagen). Complementary DNA was synthesized with the High Capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems) following the manufacturer's protocol. Quantitative RT-PCR was done on an Applied Biosystems 7500 using TaqMan® master mix and one of the following TaqMan assays (Applied Biosystems): Dnmt3a2 (Mm00463987_m1), Igf2 (Mm00439564_m1), H19 (Mm01156721_g1), Igf2r (Mm01313554_m1), Airn (Mm03943369_s1), Snrpn (Mm02391920_g1), N-Myc (Mm00476449_m1), or c-Myc (Mm00487803_m1). Three biological replicates and three technical replicates were used for each target analyzed. All threshold cycle (Ct) values were normalized to a mouse GAPDH endogenous control (Applied Biosystems), and relative quantitation was calculated from the median Ct value. High molecular weight genomic DNA was fragmented by rapid freezing on dry ice and thawing at 42 °C for five repetitions. 500 ng of fragmented DNA was bisulfite-converted with the methyl code bisulfite conversion kit (Invitrogen) per the manufacturer's instructions. Igf2/H19 differentially methylated domain (DMD) and Igf2r differentially methylated region 2 (DMR2) were amplified from bisulfite-converted DNA with Platinum Taq (Invitrogen) using primers shown in supplemental Table S1 (22.Yamasaki Y. Kayashima T. Soejima H. Kinoshita A. Yoshiura K. Matsumoto N. Ohta T. Urano T. Masuzaki H. Ishimaru T. Mukai T. Niikawa N. Kishino T. Hum. Mol.

PCR products were then TOPO TA-cloned into pCR8GW (Invitrogen). Plasmid clones were sequenced with M13 reverse primer (supplemental Table S1) using Big Dye version 3.1 chemistry with the following conditions: 96 °C for 10 s, then 25 cycles of 96 °C for 10 s, 50 °C for 5 s, and 60 °C for 4 min, and reaction products were resolved on an Applied Biosystems 3130XL genetic analyzer. 125 pmol of Nmyc siRNA (Thermo SMARTpool L-058793-01-0005) or GFP siRNA (Dharmacon D-1300-20) was combined with 0.25 ml of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen). In parallel, 7.5 μl of Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) was combined with 0.25 ml of Opti-MEM per transfection by gentle mixing. siRNA/Opti-MEM and RNAiMAX/Opti-MEM were then combined for a total volume of ∼0.5 ml and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. This mixture was then used to resuspend a pellet of 1 million wild-type ESCs. The cell suspension was then plated into 2 ml of ESC media in an individual well of a gelatin-coated 6-well plate. Media was replaced with fresh ESC media the next day. At 72 h, cells were harvested, and protein and RNA were isolated as described above. In an effort to better understand the downstream targets of Gsk-3, we performed microarray-based global gene expression analysis comparing wild-type (WT) mouse ESCs with those in which Gsk-3α, Gsk-3β, or both isoforms have been genetically deleted (Gsk-3α−/−; Gsk-3β−/− DKO) (3.Doble B.W. Patel S. Wood G.A. Kockeritz L.K. Woodgett J.R. Dev. Cell. 2007; 12: 957-971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Inspection of our array data revealed a 6.2-fold down-regulation of the de novo DNA methyltransferase Dnmt3a in Gsk-3 DKO ESCs but no effect in Gsk-3α−/− or Gsk-3β−/− ESCs (increased 1.1-fold in each). In addition to full-length Dnmt3a, there is a distinct smaller isoform, Dnmt3a2, which is transcribed from an alternative promoter within the Dnmt3a locus. Dnmt3a2 lacks the amino-terminal 219 amino acids found in Dnmt3a, but the remainder of the protein, including the domain containing methyltransferase activity, is identical between the isoforms (23.Okano M. Xie S. Li E. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 219-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (1250) Google Scholar). Importantly for this study, Dnmt3a2 is the isoform that is predominantly expressed in ESCs (24.Chen T. Ueda Y. Xie S. Li E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38746-38754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The microarray probes are unable to differentiate between Dnmt3a isoforms, and the microarray expression data represent a composite of the expression of both Dnmt3a and Dnmt3a2. Therefore, we evaluated the protein expression of each individual isoform as the individual isoforms can be resolved by immunoblotting. We found that Dnmt3a2 protein expression is substantially reduced in Gsk-3 DKO cells, whereas Dnmt3a protein levels were essentially unchanged (Fig. 1A). Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) revealed that mRNA expression of Dnmt3a2 is reduced 2.7-fold in Gsk-3 DKO ESCs when compared with WT ESCs (Fig. 1B). Dnmt3a/Dnmt3a2 activity is required for the establishment of DNA methylation at imprinted loci in germ cells (25.Kaneda M. Okano M. Hata K. Sado T. Tsujimoto N. Li E. Sasaki H. Nature. 2004; 429: 900-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). Mouse ESCs null for both Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b lose DNA methylation at imprinted loci after extended passaging, demonstrating a role for the de novo methyltransferases in the maintenance of DNA methylation at imprinted loci. Notably, re-expression of Dnmt3a2 alone in Dnmt3a−/−; Dnmt3b−/− ESCs is sufficient to fully restore DNA methylation at paternally imprinted loci, whereas re-expression of Dnmt3a or Dnmt3b1 is only able to minimally rescue DNA methylation at these loci (26.Chen T. Ueda Y. Dodge J.E. Wang Z. Li E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5594-5605Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Based on these published observations, we hypothesized that reduction of Dnmt3a2 expression in ESCs would result in the loss of DNA methylation and disruption of gene expression at imprinted loci. The imprinted locus containing the genes insulin-like growth factor II (Igf2) and H19 has been well characterized. The reciprocal expression of Igf2 and H19 is regulated by a shared imprinting control region designated the DMD (27.DeChiara T.M. Robertson E.J. Efstratiadis A. Cell. 1991; 64: 849-859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1424) Google Scholar, 28.Bartolomei M.S. Webber A.L. Brunkow M.E. Tilghman S.M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1663-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 29.Tremblay K.D. Duran K.L. Bartolomei M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4322-4329Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). In this imprinting control region, the paternal allele is methylated, resulting in expression of Igf2 and silencing of H19, whereas conversely, the maternal allele is unmethylated, promoting H19 expression while silencing Igf2 (30.Ideraabdullah F.Y. Vigneau S. Bartolomei M.S. Mutat. Res. 2008; 647: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Indeed, the imprinted genes H19 and Igf2 display altered expression in Gsk-3 DKO ESCs when compared with WT ESCs. Igf2 and H19 expression in Gsk-3 DKO cells was assayed by qPCR, and H19 expression is increased 1.4-fold, whereas Igf2 expression is decreased 100-fold (Fig. 1C). This pattern of gene expression is consistent with a scenario for the loss of DNA methylation at the Igf2/H19 DMD (29.Tremblay K.D. Duran K.L. Bartolomei M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4322-4329Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 31.Jinno Y. Sengoku K. Nakao M. Tamate K. Miyamoto T. Matsuzaka T. Sutcliffe J.S. Anan T. Takuma N. Nishiwaki K. Ikeda Y.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3693-3702Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). We directly measured DNA methylation of the Igf2/H19 DMD by bisulfite sequencing and found a 47% reduction of DNA methylation in Gsk-3 DKO ESCs when compared with WT ESCs (Fig. 1D). These results strongly support the hypothesis that the alterations in Igf2 and H19 expression are due to a loss of DNA methylation at the Igf2/H19 DMD. Expression of Air, another imprinted gene that encodes for a long non-coding RNA (34.Lyle R. Watanabe D. te Vruchte D. Lerchner W. Smrzka O.W. Wutz A. Schageman J. Hahner L. Davies C. Barlow D.P. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 19-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), is increased in Gsk-3 DKO ESCs. Air mRNA expression in Gsk-3 DKO ESCs was assayed by qPCR and is increased by 3.8-fold (Fig. 2A). We then determined whether the change in expression of Air is due to a loss of DNA methylation. We performed bisulfite sequencing on DMR2 of Igf2r, from which Air is transcribed and known to be methylated on the maternal allele (22.Yamasaki Y. Kayashima T. Soejima H. Kinoshita A. Yoshiura K. Matsumoto N. Ohta T. Urano T. Masuzaki H. Ishimaru T. Mukai T. Niikawa N. Kishino T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 2511-2520Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 35.Stöger R. Kubicka P. Liu C.G. Kafri T. Razin A. Cedar H. Barlow D.P. Cell. 1993; 73: 61-71Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). DNA methylation at DMR2 is reduced by 67% in Gsk-3 DKO ESCs (Fig. 2B). These data suggest that the increase in Air expression is likely due to DNA hypomethylation within the Igf2r DMR2 and demonstrate that the loss of Gsk-3 activity on DNA methylation extends beyond the Igf2/H19 DMD, supporting a possible broader role for Gsk-3 in the regulation of imprinted genes in the mouse. We next determined whether the DNA hypomethylation we observed at imprinted loci is due to a defect in global DNA methylation. Because Dnmt1 is the primary enzyme responsible for maintaining genome-wide DNA methylation (36.Li E. Bestor T.H. Jaenisch R. Cell. 1992; 69: 915-926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3159) Google Scholar), we examined whether the loss of Gsk-3 activity affects Dnmt1 function. Repetitive DNA sequences, such as IAP repeats, are highly methylated in WT mouse ESCs (37.Howlett S.K. Reik W. Development. 1991; 113: 119-127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and largely unmethylated in Dnmt1−/− and Dnmt1 hypomorph ESCs (38.Okano M. Bell D.W. Haber D.A. Li E. Cell. 1999; 99: 247-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4348) Google Scholar). IAP repeat methylation, although reduced, is largely retained in ESCs deficient in de novo DNA methyltransferase activity (Dnmt3a−/−; Dnmt3b−/−) (38.Okano M. Bell D.W. Haber D.A. Li E. Cell. 1999; 99: 247-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4348) Google Scholar, 39.Lei H. Oh S.P. Okano M. Jüttermann R. Goss K.A. Jaenisch R. Li E. Development. 1996; 122: 3195-3205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, analyzing DNA methylation of IAP repeats provides an assay for Dnmt1 activity. Southern blotting using methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes revealed that Gsk-3 DKO ESCs do not exhibit a significant difference in DNA methylation of IAP repeats when compared with wild-type ESCs (Fig. 2C), suggesting that there is not a general defect in DNA maintenance methylation in Gsk-3 DKO cells. These data strengthen our hypothesis that the loss of DNA methylation observed at imprinted loci in Gsk-3 DKO ESCs is likely the result of specific down-regulation of Dnmt3a2 expression. To evaluate whether exogenous expression of Dnmt3a2 could rescue the loss of DNA methylation at imprinted loci in Gsk-3 DKO ESCs, we isolated puromycin-resistant Gsk-3 DKO ESCs stably expressing Dnmt3a2 under the control of the chicken β-actin (CAG) promoter and evaluated DNA methylation at the Igf2/H19 DMD by bisulfite sequencing. A puromycin-resistant clone in which Dnmt3a2 is stably overexpressed in DKO ESCs (Dnmt3a2) was selected for bisulfite sequencing analysis, and a puromycin-resistant clone that does not overexpress Dnmt3a2 (Vector) served as a negative control (Fig. 3A). Bisulfite sequencing of the Igf2/H19 DMD revealed that DNA methylation is restored to levels previously observed in WT ESCs in the overexpressing clone (92.7%; Fig. 3B). Rescue of the Igf2/H19 DMD methylation defect by stably expressing Dnmt3a2 in Gsk-3 DKO ESCs strongly supports our hypothesis that reduced Dnmt3a2 expression in Gsk-3 DKO ESCs is the cause of decreased DNA methylation at imprinted loci. Based on the data obtained from Gsk-3 DKO ESCs, we hypothesized that the Gsk-3 inhibitor lithium (40.Klein P.S. Melton D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

https://openalex.org/W2068279398,"Background Since late 2003, the highly pathogenic influenza A H5N1 had initiated several outbreak waves that swept across the Eurasia and Africa continents. Getting prepared for reassortment or mutation of H5N1 viruses has become a global priority. Although the spreading mechanism of H5N1 has been studied from different perspectives, its main transmission agents and spread route problems remain unsolved. Methodology/Principal Findings Based on a compilation of the time and location of global H5N1 outbreaks from November 2003 to December 2006, we report an interdisciplinary effort that combines the geospatial informatics approach with a bioinformatics approach to form an improved understanding on the transmission mechanisms of H5N1 virus. Through a spherical coordinate based analysis, which is not conventionally done in geographical analyses, we reveal obvious spatial and temporal clusters of global H5N1 cases on different scales, which we consider to be associated with two different transmission modes of H5N1 viruses. Then through an interdisciplinary study of both geographic and phylogenetic analysis, we obtain a H5N1 spreading route map. Our results provide insight on competing hypotheses as to which avian hosts are responsible for the spread of H5N1. Conclusions/Significance We found that although South China and Southeast Asia may be the virus pool of avian flu, East Siberia may be the source of the H5N1 epidemic. The concentration of migratory birds from different places increases the possibility of gene mutation. Special attention should be paid to East Siberia, Middle Siberia and South China for improved surveillance of H5N1 viruses and monitoring of migratory birds."

Supplementation of maternal diet with genistein, a phytoestrogen ubiquitous in the daily diet, altered coat color of agouti mice due to epigenetic changes. We studied hematopoiesis of mice prenatally exposed to genistein (270 mg/kg feed) compared with that of mice prenatally exposed to phytoestrogen-poor feed and observed a significant increase in granulopoi-esis, erythropoiesis, and mild macrocytosis at the adult age of 12 wk. Genistein exposure was associated with hypermethylation of certain repetitive elements, which coincided with a significant down-regulation of estrogen-responsive genes and genes involved in hematopoi-esis in bone marrow cells of genistein-exposed mice, as assessed by microarray technology. Although genistein exposure did not affect global methylation in fetal liver of fetuses at embryonic day 14.5, it accelerated the switch from primitive to definitive erythroid lineage. Taken together, our data demonstrate that prenatal exposure to genistein affects fetal erythropoiesis and exerts lifelong alterations in gene expression and DNA methylation of hematopoietic cells.—Vanhees, K., Coort, S., Ruitjers, E.J.

Lipids are crucial metabolic fuels, and their transport, storage, and utilization is governed by numerous mechanisms to maintain homeostasis. The dysregulation of lipid homeostasis contributes to the pathogenesis of common diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.

Hotamisligil G.S. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2008; 7: 489-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar, 2Storch J. Corsico B. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2008; 28: 73-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). These activities are accomplished through increasing fatty acid solubility, mobility, and rate of utilization within the cell (2Storch J. Corsico B. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2008; 28: 73-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). fatty acid-binding protein brown adipose tissue free fatty acid triglyceride oxygen consumption rate. The FABP family consists of at least eight members in mammals, which appear to have arisen through duplication of an ancestral gene (2Storch J. Corsico B. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2008; 28: 73-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 3Chmurzyńska A. J. Appl. Genet. 2006; 47: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar, 4Haunerland N.H. Spener F. Prog. Lipid Res. 2004; 43: 328-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Members of the FABP family have been named according to the tissue where they are expressed most prominently, although there is significant overlap in tissue distribution among some members (2Storch J. Corsico B. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2008; 28: 73-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 4Haunerland N.H. Spener F. Prog. Lipid Res. 2004; 43: 328-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 5Zimmerman A.W. Veerkamp J.H. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 1096-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Multiple FABP family members are expressed in adipose tissue, but their physiological roles in this tissue have not been characterized. The adipose-type FABP4 (also known as aP2) has been considered the major FABP in white and brown adipose tissue, as well as in macrophages (6Coe N.R. Bernlohr D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1391: 287-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 7Makowski L. Hotamisligil G.S. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2005; 16: 543-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). FABP4 is generally thought to facilitate fatty acid transport between intracellular compartments for storage or export, as disruption of the Fabp4 gene in mice led to increased intracellular free fatty acids in the cytosol (8Coe N.R. Simpson M.A. Bernlohr D.A. J. Lipid. Res. 1999; 40: 967-972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Hotamisligil G.S. Johnson R.S. Distel R.J. Ellis R. Papaioannou V.E. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1996; 274: 1377-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). The epidermis-type FABP5 (also known as Mal1) is expressed in epidermal cells and other tissues, including brown adipose tissue (10Maeda K. Uysal K.T. Makowski L. Görgün C.Z. Atsumi G. Parker R.A. Brüning J. Hertzel A.V. Bernlohr D.A. Hotamisligil G.S. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 300-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Finally, heart-type FABP3, which is most abundantly expressed in heart, skeletal muscle, brain, and other tissues, is induced in brown adipose tissue (BAT) in hibernating squirrel (11Hittel D. Storey K.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1522: 238-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 12Hittel D. Storey K.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 401: 244-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and bat (13Eddy S.F. Storey K.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1676: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It is also induced by acute cold exposure in rat (14Daikoku T. Shinohara Y. Shima A. Yamazaki N. Terada H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 15Yamashita H. Wang Z. Wang Y. Segawa M. Kusudo T. Kontani Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 377: 632-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The physiological roles of FABP3 have been investigated with knock-out mouse models (reviewed in Ref. 16Binas B. Erol E. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2007; 299: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Characterization of FABP3-deficient mice has focused largely on the effects of fatty acid metabolism in heart and skeletal muscle, tissues in which this protein is abundantly expressed. In vivo labeling studies revealed reduced palmitic and arachidonic acid uptake in heart of Fabp3−/− mice (17Murphy E.J. Barcelo-Coblijn G. Binas B. Glatz J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34481-34488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and reduced palmitic acid uptake and utilization in isolated cardiomyocytes (18Binas B. Danneberg H. McWhir J. Mullins L. Clark A.J. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 805-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 19Schaap F.G. Binas B. Danneberg H. van der Vusse G.J. Glatz J.F. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). There was a compensatory reliance on glucose oxidation in the heart of Fabp3−/− mice. Fabp3−/− and Fabp3+/− mice also exhibit increased insulin sensitivity, perhaps related to the increased reliance on glucose rather than fatty acid fuels (20Erol E. Cline G.W. Kim J.K. Taegtmeyer H. Binas B. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2004; 287: E977-E982Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 21Shearer J. Fueger P.T. Bracy D.P. Wasserman D.H. Rottman J.N. Diabetes. 2005; 54: 3133-3139Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Thus, FABP3 has important roles in fatty acid metabolism in heart and skeletal muscle, with effects on systemic glucose homeostasis. The induction of FABP3 in BAT during cold exposure described above raised the possibility that this protein may have a role in fatty acid trafficking in adaptive thermogenesis. Adaptive thermogenesis involves shivering to increase energy output in skeletal muscle, as well as nonshivering heat generation in BAT upon stimulation by the sympathetic nervous system (22Cannon B. Nedergaard J. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 277-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (4543) Google Scholar, 23Lowell B.B. Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2000; 404: 652-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1307) Google Scholar). Nonshivering thermogenesis is well known as a mechanism for heat generation in rodents and other small mammals, and recently, it has been shown to be metabolically active in adult humans (24Cypess A.M. Lehman S. Williams G. Tal I. Rodman D. Goldfine A.B. Kuo F.C. Palmer E.L. Tseng Y.H. Doria A. Kolodny G.M. Kahn C.R. N. Engl. J.

Frontini A. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. Cinti S. FASEB J. 2009; 23: 3113-3120Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). The elucidation of mechanisms that modulate BAT thermogenesis is therefore of high significance in understanding the regulation of energy balance in mammals, including humans. Several factors that are required for adaptive thermogenesis in BAT have been defined in rodents (22Cannon B. Nedergaard J. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 277-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (4543) Google Scholar, 23Lowell B.B. Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2000; 404: 652-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1307) Google Scholar). One key factor is the mitochondrial uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1). UCP1 is responsible for enabling the proton leak in mitochondria that dissipates energy resulting from oxidative metabolism. In the mouse, UCP1 is essential for adaptive thermogenesis in response to acute cold exposure (30Enerbäck S. Jacobsson A. Simpson E.M. Guerra C. Yamashita H. Harper M.E. Kozak L.P. Nature. 1997; 387: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar) but not for gradual adaptation to the cold (31Shabalina I.G. Hoeks J. Kramarova T.V. Schrauwen P. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1797: 968-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Furthermore, UCP1 deficiency prevents diet-induced thermogenesis and promotes obesity in mice maintained at thermoneutrality (32Feldmann H.M. Golozoubova V. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. Cell Metab. 2009; 9: 203-209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar), whereas enhanced UCP1 expression in BAT protects against diet-induced obesity, due to increased energy expenditure (33Kopecky J. Clarke G. Enerbäck S. Spiegelman B. Kozak L.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2914-2923Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Beyond UCP1, fatty acids have a key role in thermogenesis as the source of oxidative fuel in the mitochondria (34Ellis J.M. Li L.O. Wu P.C. Koves T.R. Ilkayeva O. Stevens R.D. Watkins S.M. Muoio D.M.

The process by which fatty acids destined for oxidation during BAT thermogenesis are targeted to the mitochondria is not fully understood but is likely to involve members of the FABP family. Here, using FABP3-deficient mice, we demonstrate an essential role for FABP3 in whole body thermoregulation and in fatty acid oxidation in BAT, a tissue in which FABP4 and FABP5 have been considered to be the major players. Mice lacking FABP3 displayed severely impaired cold tolerance, whereas FABP4-deficient mice had normal cold tolerance. FAPB3 cold sensitivity occurred even in the presence of a normal response of muscle to cold and normal induction of thermogenic and fatty acid oxidation machinery in BAT. Using isolated BAT, as well as gain- and loss-of-function approaches in cultured brown adipocytes, we detected a direct effect of FABP3 on the rate of exogenous fatty acid oxidation in this tissue. These studies establish a unique role for FABP3 in directing the utilization of exogenously supplied fatty acids for energy expenditure in BAT. Mouse embryonic stem cells containing a gene-trap insertion in the Fabp3 gene (cell line XE705) were obtained from the BayGenomics gene-trap consortium (39Stryke D. Kawamoto M. Huang C.C. Johns S.J. King L.A. Harper C.A. Meng E.C. Lee R.E. Yee A. L'Italien L. Chuang P.T. Young S.G. Skarnes W.C. Babbitt P.C. Ferrin T.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 278-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Chimeric mice were generated by blastocyst microinjection and then crossed with C57BL/6J mice for at least four generations. The site of the gene-trap insertion within intron 1 of Fabp3 was determined by inverse PCR. Offspring were genotyped by PCR of genomic DNA with primers specific for the wild-type Fabp3 allele and for the mutant allele carrying the gene-trap insertion. FABP4-deficient mice were a generous gift from Dr. Judith Storch (Rutgers University). Mice were housed in standard conditions (12-h/light/dark cycle) and fed Purina 5001 chow diet. Mouse studies were performed under approval from the Veterans Affairs Greater Los Angeles or UCLA IACUC. Total RNA was isolated from mouse tissues by extraction with TRIzol (Invitrogen). cDNA synthesis, RT-PCR, and real time PCR were performed as described previously (40Vergnes L. Beigneux A.P. Davis R. Watkins S.M. Young S.G. Reue K. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 745-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Many of the primer sequences used in this study have been described previously (40Vergnes L. Beigneux A.P. Davis R. Watkins S.M. Young S.G. Reue K. J.

Other primer sequences are as follows: Fabp3 (agtcactggtgacgctggacg; aggcagcatggtgctgagctg); Fabp4 (gaacctggaagcttgtcttcg; accagcttgtcaccatctcg); Fabp5 (cacggctttgaggagtacatg; accgtcttggaaggtgcaga); Myl1 (gcaacaggaggacttcaagg; tctcttcattgctggggttc); Myh7 (acaacccctacgattatgcgt; acgtcaaaggcgctatccgtg); Tnni1 (tccacaacaccagagagatcaagg; gcatggcatcggctgagacacg); Tnni2 (cctgaagagtgtgatgctcca; cccgttccttctcagtgtctt); G6p (acttgttccctggccctgctgc; ctctgcaaatcagccgaggc); Ucp2 (gccacttcacttctgccttc; gaaggcatgaaccccttgta); Ucp3 (atgagttttgcctccattcg; ggcgtatcatggcttgaaat); Cebpα (gaacagcaacgagtaccgggta; gccatggccttgaccaaggag); Serca1a (ctgccgatgatcttcaagctc; cagggcacaagggctggttac); and Serca2a (atctccttgcctgtgatcctc; agtcatgcagagggctggtag). Tissue concentrations of FABP3 were measured with a sandwich-type ELISA (HK403, HyCult Biotechnology) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, tissues were homogenized with a mechanical Ultra-Turrax® in 0.25 m sucrose, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Complete Mini, EDTA-free, Roche Applied Science). Total proteins were quantified with a commercial kit (BCA kit; Pierce) for normalization between samples. Data are reported as the average of determinations from samples of three mice, each measured in duplicate. Prior to cold exposure, mice were provided with food and water ad libitum overnight. The next morning, the mice were housed without food or bedding and placed at 4 °C for 4 h. Body temperature was measured with a BAT-10 digital thermometer with a Ret-3 rectal probe (Physitemp Instruments). BAT surface temperature was measured by placing the temperature probe on the interscapular surface. Three separate cold exposure studies were performed with independent groups of male or female mice. These studies gave very similar results, indicating that this phenotype is not sex-specific. Data presented here are from male mice. Plasma glucose levels were measured with a OneTouch® Ultra® blood glucose monitor (LifeScan). Tissue lipid analyses were conducted as described previously (40Vergnes L. Beigneux A.P. Davis R. Watkins S.M. Young S.G. Reue K. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 745-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Creatine kinase was determined in 25 μl of plasma (Pointe Scientific, Inc.) with an automated spectrophotometer connected to a water bath at 37 °C. Samples were measured twice and expressed as the average absorbance difference per min, multiplied by the factor 6592 (IU/liter). Total genomic DNA from BAT tissue was isolated by phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol extraction. Mitochondrial and nuclear DNA were amplified by real time PCR with 25 ng of DNA and primers in the D-loop region (aatctaccatcctccgtgaaacc; tcagtttagctacccccaagtttaa) and Tert gene (ctagctcatgtgtcaagaccctctt; gccagcacgtttctctcgtt), respectively. Glycogen was extracted from frozen tissues (100 mg) as described previously (43Crosson S.M. Khan A. Printen J. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 1423-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The supernatant fluid was used to measure glucose (Autokit Glucose, Wako Pure Chemicals); values were expressed as nanograms of glycosyl residue per g of tissue. For β-galactosidase activity staining, fresh tissues were directly embedded in optimum cutting temperature compound (Sakura Finetek), frozen, and sectioned. Sections were fixed with 2% formaldehyde and 0.2% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 5 min and incubated in X-Gal solution at 37 °C overnight (44Beigneux A.P. Kosinski C. Gavino B. Horton J.D. Skarnes W.C. Young S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9557-9564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). For immunochemical detection of β-galactosidase protein, cryosections were quenched for endogenous peroxidase activity with 0.6% H2O2 in methanol for 20 min. Sections were fixed with cold acetone for 10 min, blocked with 10% rabbit serum in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 for 3 h, and incubated overnight with primary anti-β-galactosidase antibody (1:250 dilution, ab9361, Abcam). Following a 1-h incubation with secondary HRP-conjugated anti-chicken antibody (1:1000 dilution, ab6753, Abcam), staining was revealed with diaminobenzidine (D4293, Sigma). Oxygen consumption was determined with an Oxymax single cage system and recorded with Oxymax version 3.2 software (Columbus Instruments). Oxygen consumption and CO2 production were recorded every 6 min throughout a 24-h period. The respiratory quotient represents the ratio of O2 over CO2 values. Values were averaged over light (7 a.m. to 6 p.m.) and dark (6 p.m. to 7 a.m.) periods. For the culture of primary brown adipocytes, interscapular brown adipose tissue was isolated, minced, and digested with 20 mg of collagenase type II (clostridiopeptidase A, Sigma C-6885) in 10 ml of DMEM (without serum) with 2% BSA and 25 mm HEPES at 37 °C for 30 min. The homogenate was filtered through a 70-μm filter and decanted for 20 min on ice to remove mature adipocytes. Precursor cells were centrifuged at 800 × g for 5 min and resuspended in differentiation medium (DMEM supplemented with 4 nm insulin and 25 μg/ml sodium ascorbate, 10% serum). Cells were allowed to differentiate into mature brown adipocytes for 7 days. Some studies were conducted in an established mouse brown adipocyte cell line obtained from Dr. Bruce Spiegelman (38Lin J.

Primary brown adipocytes were preincubated with 0.5 μm norepinephrine, and cells were collected, and protein levels were determined for normalization. Intracellular lipid labeling was determined by TLC. Cells were collected with 200 μl of 5% TCA, and an aliquot was saved for protein determination. Lipids were extracted with chloroform/MeOH (2:1) and resolved on TLC plates with hexane/ether/acetic acid (80:20:1) solvent. Using standards for each lipid species, the bands corresponding to FFA and triglyceride were scraped from the plate and measured by liquid scintillation counting. Experiments were performed twice with triplicate wells. Cellular metabolic rates were measured in primary tissue pieces or in cultured cells using an XF24 extracellular flux analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience). For measurements of metabolism in primary brown fat, tissues were collected and finely minced in PBS. Pieces of tissue of equal size were rinsed with 20 ml of PBS, placed in the bottom of a Seahorse Islet Capture Microplate, and kept in place with the screen provided with the kit. The pieces of tissue were washed with unbuffered Krebs-Henseleit buffer containing 1 μm norepinephrine and incubated 1 h before starting the experiment. Palmitate oxidation was measured as described using a final palmitate concentration of 200 μm (47Wu M. Neilson A. Swift A.L. Moran R. Tamagnine J. Parslow D. Armistead S. Lemire K. Orrell J. Teich J.

For Fabp3 overexpression, mouse Fabp3 cDNA was cloned in pcDNA3.1/V5-His vector (Invitrogen) and transfected with BioT (Bioland). For RNA interference, cells were reverse-transfected with ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool siRNA (Dharmacon) and siPORT amine reagent (Ambion). 48 h prior to analysis, differentiated cells were transfected and seeded at 60,000 cells per well in V28 plates (Seahorse Bioscience). Cells were preincubated with 0.5 μm norepinephrine for 3 h prior to start of the experiment. Immediately before the measurement, cells were washed with unbuffered DMEM or DMEM buffered with Krebs-Henseleit Buffer as described previously (47Wu M. Neilson A. Swift A.L. Moran R. Tamagnine J.

To begin to tease apart the specific roles of these two fatty acid-binding proteins in BAT, we examined the relative tissue distributions and response to cold exposure in mouse. Analysis of Fabp3 mRNA levels in tissues from C57BL/6J mice revealed highest expression in heart, followed by skeletal muscle (Fig. 1A). Under standard laboratory conditions, Fabp3 was also expressed at substantial levels in BAT, at ∼50% the level in skeletal muscle. By contrast, the adipocyte-type Fabp4 was expressed at highest levels in BAT, followed by gonadal and inguinal white adipose tissue, with lower levels in heart and muscle (Fig. 1A). FABP3 protein levels mirrored the mRNA levels, with highest levels in heart and lower levels in skeletal muscle and BAT (Fig. 1B). Thus, FABP3 mRNA and protein are present in BAT of C57BL/6J mice maintained at room temperature. Because BAT plays a key role in the maintenance of body temperature in rodents, we determined whether mouse Fabp3 gene expression in BAT is induced by acute cold exposure. C57BL/6J mice were maintained at 4 °C for 8 h. After 8 h, Fabp3 mRNA levels were induced significantly in BAT, heart, and skeletal muscle but not in white adipose tissue (Fig. 1C). Fabp4 (Fig. 1C) and Fabp5 mRNA levels (Fig. 1D) were not affected by cold exposure. In parallel with changes in mRNA levels, FABP3 protein was significantly increased after cold exposure in BAT, skeletal muscle, and heart (Fig. 1E). These results establish that Fabp3, but not Fabp4 or Fabp5 expression, increases in BAT, heart, and skeletal muscle in response to cold exposure. To investigate the physiological role of FABP3 in adaptive thermogenesis, we generated FABP3-deficient mice with an embryonic stem cell line carrying a gene-trap insertional mutation in the Fabp3 gene. The gene-trap insertion occurred in intron 1, generating a fusion protein containing the first 24 amino acids of FABP3 joined in-frame to a βgeo reporter (Fig. 2A). Mice homozygous for the mutant allele are deficient in FABP3, confirmed by the failure to detect Fabp3 mRNA by RT-PCR (Fig. 2B). β-Galactosidase expression in tissues of Fabp3−/− mice was detected at the sites where F"
https://openalex.org/W2037651260,"The vanilloid transient receptor potential channel TRPV1 is a tetrameric six-transmembrane segment (S1-S6) channel that can be synergistically activated by various proalgesic agents such as capsaicin, protons, heat, or highly depolarizing voltages, and also by 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB), a common activator of the related thermally gated vanilloid TRP channels TRPV1, TRPV2, and TRPV3. In these channels, the conserved charged residues in the intracellular S4-S5 region have been proposed to constitute part of a voltage sensor that acts in concert with other stimuli to regulate channel activation. The molecular basis of this gating event is poorly understood. We mutated charged residues all along the S4 and the S4-S5 linker of TRPV1 and identified four potential voltage-sensing residues (Arg(557), Glu(570), Asp(576), and Arg(579)) that, when specifically mutated, altered the functionality of the channel with respect to voltage, capsaicin, heat, 2-APB, and/or their interactions in different ways. The nonfunctional charge-reversing mutations R557E and R579E were partially rescued by the charge-swapping mutations R557E/E570R and D576R/R579E, indicating that electrostatic interactions contribute to allosteric coupling between the voltage-, temperature- and capsaicin-dependent activation mechanisms. The mutant K571E was normal in all aspects of TRPV1 activation except for 2-APB, revealing the specific role of Lys(571) in chemical sensitivity. Surprisingly, substitutions at homologous residues in TRPV2 or TRPV3 had no effect on temperature- and 2-APB-induced activity. Thus, the charged residues in S4 and the S4-S5 linker contribute to voltage sensing in TRPV1 and, despite their highly conserved nature, regulate the temperature and chemical gating in the various TRPV channels in different ways."
https://openalex.org/W2007892053,"Our previous studies have suggested that the mammalian additional sex comb-like 1 protein functions as a coactivator or repressor of retinoic acid receptors in a cell-specific manner. Here, we investigated the roles of additional sex comb-like 1 proteins in regulating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). In pulldown assays in vitro and in immunoprecipitation assays in vivo, ASXL1 and its paralog, ASXL2, interacted with PPARα and PPARγ. In 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cells, overexpression of ASXL1 inhibited the induction of PPARγ activity by rosiglitazone, as shown by transcription assays, and completely suppressed adipogenesis, as shown by Oil Red O staining. In contrast, overexpression of ASXL2 greatly enhanced rosiglitazone-induced PPARγ activity and enhanced adipogenesis. Deletion of the heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1)-binding domain from ASXL1 caused the mutant protein to enhance adipogenesis similarly to ASXL2, indicating that HP1 binding is required for the adipogenesis-suppressing activity of ASXL1. Adipocyte differentiation was associated with a gradual decrease in ASXL1 expression but did not affect ASXL2 expression. Knockdown of ASXL1 and ASXL2 had reciprocal effects on adipogenesis. In chromatin immunoprecipitation assays in 3T3-L1 cells, ASXL1 occupied the promoter of the PPARγ target gene aP2 together with HP1α and Lys-9-methylated histone H3, whereas ASXL2 occupied the aP2 promoter together with histone-lysine N-methyltransferase MLL1 and Lys-9-acetylated and Lys-4-methylated H3 histones. Finally, microarray analysis demonstrated that ASXL1 represses, whereas ASXL2 increases, the expression of adipogenic genes, most of which are PPARγ targets. These results suggest that members of the additional sex comb-like family provide complex regulation of adipogenesis via differential modulation of PPARγ activity.

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) 3The abbreviations used are: PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; ASXL, additional sex comb-like; IP, immunoprecipitation; qPCR, quantitative PCR. are ligand-dependent transcription factors that belong to the nuclear receptor superfamily. Extensive studies have suggested that PPARs play major roles in various physiological processes, including lipid metabolism, inflammation, and angiogenesis (reviewed in Refs. 1Berger J.P.

One member of the PPAR family, PPARγ, functions primarily in adipocyte differentiation; it is induced during adipogenesis and is both necessary and sufficient for adipocyte differentiation to occur (4Tontonoz P. Spiegelman B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2008; 77: 289-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1587) Google Scholar). When bound to ligands with agonist activity, such as rosiglitazone, a synthetic thiazolidinedione, PPARγ, forms a heterodimer with a retinoid X receptor; this dimer regulates the expression of specific subsets of genes containing a PPARγ-response element in their promoters (4Tontonoz P. Spiegelman B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2008; 77: 289-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1587) Google Scholar). These genes include those encoding adipocyte lipid-binding protein 2 (aP2), fatty acid-binding protein 4, and lipoprotein lipase. Recent genome-wide microarray and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analyses have identified several other PPARγ target genes (5Perera R.J. Marcusson E.G. Koo S. Kang X. Kim Y. White N. Dean N.M.

Like that of other nuclear receptors, the activity of PPARγ is differentially regulated by its association with various coregulators (10Miard S. Fajas L. Int. J. Obes.

In the absence of ligand, PPARγ associates with corepressors, such as nuclear receptor corepressor or silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors, to repress PPARγ-mediated transcription, leading to adipogenic blockage in 3T3-L1 cells, a mouse embryonic fibroblast-like preadipose cell line (13Yu C.

Binding of the NAD-dependent deacetylase Sirt1 to PPARγ represses PPARγ transcriptional activity by recruiting nuclear receptor corepressor and silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors to its target genes, thereby repressing fat accumulation in adipocytes (14Picard F.

Ligand binding induces a conformational change in the PPARγ ligand-binding domain, leading to the release of corepressors; as a result, a variety of coactivators with histone lysine acetyltransferase activity are recruited to PPARγ-responsive promoters, thereby activating transcription (12Yu S.

PPARγ participates in regulation at the epigenetic level through its direct association with histone-modifying enzymes or by its indirect association with these enzymes via coregulators (18Leader J.E.

Cyclin D1 recruits histone deacetylases and histone methyltransferase Suv39H1 to PPARγ-responsive gene promoters through protein-protein interactions, leading to decreased acetylation and increased methylation of Lys-9 of histone H3 (H3K9), thereby inhibiting adipogenic gene expression and adipogenesis (20Fu M.

Recently, activation of the histone methyltransferase SETDB1 via Wnt-NLK signaling was reported to induce H3K9 methylation at PPARγ target genes; activated SETDB1 forms a complex with PPARγ, inactivating PPARγ and inducing osteoblastogenesis (22Takada I. Mihara M. Suzawa M. Ohtake F. Kobayashi S. Igarashi M. Youn M.Y. Takeyama K. Nakamura T. Mezaki Y. Takezawa S. Yogiashi Y. Kitagawa H. Yamada G. Takada S. Minami Y. Shibuya H. Matsumoto K. Kato S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 1273-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). By binding to methylated H3K9, heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1)-α appears to participate in gene silencing by inducing the formation of higher order chromatin structure (23Lachner M. O'Carroll D.

Nature. 2001; 410: 120-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (2196) Google Scholar). Other studies have suggested that methylation of Lys-4 of histone H3 (H3K4), probably by histone-lysine N-methyltransferase MLL3, at adipogenic genes is critical for gene activation and adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells (25Musri M.M.

These histone modifications may provide for diverse regulation of PPARγ at the chromatin level during adipocyte differentiation. We previously showed that additional sex comb-like 1 (ASXL1), a mammalian homolog of the Drosophila protein Asx, both enhances the transcriptional activity of retinoic acid receptors by associating with steroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC-1) and represses the activity of these receptors by recruiting lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) and HP1 to the target gene in a cell type-specific manner (27Cho Y.S.

Here, we investigated the different roles of ASXL1 and its paralog ASXL2 in the regulation of other PPARs and in adipocyte differentiation. We found that ASXL1 suppresses the transactivation activity of ligand-bound PPARγ, as well as its adipocyte differentiation-inducing activity, whereas ASXL2 promotes these activities. Consistent with these observations, ASXL1 occupies the aP2 promoter together with HP1α and methylated H3K9, whereas ASXL2 occupies the aP2 promoter together with acetylated H3K9, methylated H3K4, and the histone-lysine H3K4 methyltransferase MLL1. We also examined the genome-wide response of ASXLs to PPARγ regulation using microarray analysis. Our results establish that ASXL1 and ASXL2 play different roles in PPARγ regulation, providing additional insight pertinent to the treatment of fat-related disorders. 3T3-L1 and HEK293 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS and antibiotic/antimycotic agents (all from Invitrogen) in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. For use with cells to be treated with PPAR ligands, the FBS was pretreated with charcoal. All cDNAs were constructed according to standard methods and verified by sequencing. Deletion or point mutants of the desired genes were created by PCR amplification. DNA sequences encoding murine ASXL1, a murine ASXL1 mutant defective for HP1 binding (ASXL1ΔHP1), and human ASXL2 were inserted into the G418-resistant pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen), which inserted a 2× FLAG epitope tag in front of the encoded proteins. The resulting vectors expressed 2× FLAG-tagged proteins, designated FLAG-ASXL1, FLAG-ASXL1ΔHP1, and FLAG-ASXL2, respectively. DNA sequences encoding amino acids 961–1514 of murine ASXL1 or amino acids 916–1435 of human ASXL2 were inserted into the pGEX4T-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences), which fused the glutathione S-transferase (GST) coding sequence to those of ASXL1 and ASXL2, creating the GST-ASXL1 and GST-ASXL2 fusion proteins. GST-ASXL1 and GST-ASXL1 were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) by standard methods. FLAG-tagged PPARα and FLAG-tagged PPARγ were translated in vitro in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega, Madison, WI). Then approximately equal amounts of GST or GST fusion protein and FLAG-tagged PPARα or FLAG-tagged PPARγ were mixed, and bound proteins were detected by Western blotting using anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma). Primary antibodies against HP1α, trimethylated H3K4 (H3K4me3), trimethylated H3K9 (H3K9me3), and acetylated H3K9 (H3K9Ac) were from Upstate (Chicago, IL; catalog numbers 05-689, 07-473, 07-442, and 07-352, respectively); anti-PPARγ antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA; catalog number sc-7273); anti-MLL1 antibody was from Bethyl Laboratories (Montgomery, TX; catalog number A300-374A); and anti-FLAG M2 and anti-β-actin antibodies were from Sigma (catalog numbers F3165 and A1978, respectively). Anti-ASXL1 and -ASXL2 antibodies were affinity-purified from rabbit polyclonal serum raised against amino acids 233–247 of mouse ASXL1 and mouse monoclonal ascites fluid raised against amino acids 1213–1396 of human ASXL2, respectively. Both antibodies were able to recognize human and mouse ASXLs. For Western blotting, cells were lysed in a lysis buffer (27Cho Y.S. Kim E.J. Park U.H. Sin H.S. Um S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17588-17598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and proteins in the lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 8–12% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were incubated with primary antibodies as indicated and then with peroxidase-conjugated mouse or rabbit IgG secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences). The protein bands were detected with an ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). For IP, HEK293 cells were treated with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) with or without 1 μm rosiglitazone (a PPARγ-specific agonist; BioVision, Mountain View, CA) overnight and lysed in RIPA buffer supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The lysates were incubated overnight at 4 °C with a 1:200 dilution of anti-PPARγ antibody and then with A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer, and the bound immune complexes were released from the beads by boiling and analyzed by Western blotting. For study of the ASXL2-PPARγ interaction, the HEK293 cells were transfected with FLAG-ASXL2 cDNA prior to DMSO or rosiglitazone treatment. HEK293 cells were seeded in 12-well culture plates (1.5 × 105 cells/well). Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen) was used to cotransfect the cells with an aP2 promoter-luciferase reporter vector and various amounts of ASXL1 or ASXL2 expression vector. After a 6-h incubation, the cells were washed, fed with medium containing 5% charcoal-stripped FBS, and incubated for an additional 20 h in the presence of 1 μm rosiglitazone. The cells were then washed with ice-cold PBS, collected, resuspended in 100 μl of luciferase lysis buffer (Promega), and subjected to three freeze-thaw cycles. The luciferase activity was measured and normalized to the β-galactosidase activity as described previously (28Lee S.W. Cho Y.S. Na J.M. Park U.H. Kang M. Kim E.J. Um S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 18-29Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). For RNAi experiments, ASXL1- and ASXL2-specific siRNA duplexes were synthesized by Invitrogen. The ASXL1 duplex had the sense and antisense sequences 5′-CCUCCAUCCAGUGACAAAUCCCAUU-3′ and 5′-AAUGGGAUUUGUCACUGGAUGGAGG-3′, respectively, and the ASXL2 duplex specific had the sense and antisense sequences 5′-GAGCUUUAGGAGGACCCAUUCUGUA-3′ and 5′-UACAGAAUGGGUCCUCCUAAAGCUC-3′, respectively. The control siRNA was a duplex of the sense sequence 5′-CCUACGCCACCAAUUUCGU-3′ and the antisense sequence 5′-ACGAAAUUGGUGGCGUAGG-3′. HEK293 or 3T3-L1 cells were transfected with siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000 in Opti-MEM I reduced serum medium (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Knockdown of gene expression was verified by Western blotting using anti-ASXL antibodies. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were transfected with pcDNA3 derivatives encoding FLAG-ASXL1, FLAG-ASXL1ΔHP1, or FLAG-ASXL2 or with empty pcDNA3 encoding the FLAG tag only using Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen). After 48 h, the cells were treated with 0.6 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). After 5–7 days, the culture medium was replaced with fresh culture medium containing G418, and G418-resistant colonies were selected for 2 weeks. Stably transfected cells were verified by Western blotting using anti-FLAG antibody. For studies of the effects of overexpression of ASXL1 and ASXL2, HEK293 cells were transfected with pcDNA3 derivatives encoding FLAG-ASXL1 or FLAG-ASXL2, or with empty pcDNA3 encoding the FLAG tag only. For studies of the effect of knockdown of ASXL1 and ASXL2 expression, HEK293 cells were transfected with the corresponding ASXL1- or ASXL2-specific siRNA duplexes. Transfected cells were treated with 1 μm rosiglitazone, and the total RNA was extracted using Easy-Blue Reagent (Intron Biotechnology, Kyunggi, Korea). Then 2 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and random primers (Invitrogen). Quantitative PCRs (qPCR) were performed using the iQTM SYBR Green Supermix and Icycler CFX96 real time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad) with the primers as shown in Table 1. The mRNA expression data were normalized to the level of GAPDH mRNA expression and expressed as fold-increases relative to the controls.TABLE 1Primer sequences used for real time PCRGeneForward primer (5′ to 3′)Reverse primer (5′ to 3′)aP2γAAAGACAGCTCCTCCTCGAAGGTTTGACCAAATCCCCATTTACGCLPLATCCATGGATGGACGGTAACGCTGGATCCCAATACTTCGACCAGAPDHCGGCTACCACATCCAAGGAAAGCCACATCGCTCAGACACC Open table in a new tab For normal RT-PCR, stably transfected 3T3-L1 cells were grown in DMEM containing 10% charcoal-stripped FBS and treated with or without 1 μm rosiglitazone.

Two days later (on day 0), the cells were treated with a differentiation-inducing mixture containing 1 μm rosiglitazone, 0.5 μm dexamethasone, 100 μm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, and 1 μg/ml insulin (day 0). The medium was removed every 2 days and replaced with fresh medium containing DMEM plus 10% FBS, 1 μg/ml insulin, and 1 μm rosiglitazone. Cells were harvested for Western blotting, RT-PCR, or ChIP analysis every 2 days. Stably transfected 3T3-L1 cells induced to differentiate as described above under “Differentiation of 3T3-L1 Cells” for a total of 8 days were washed twice with PBS (pH 7.4) and fixed with 2 ml of 10% formalin in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were stained with 0.5% Oil Red O (Sigma) for 30 min with gentle agitation, and the excess stain was removed using 60% isopropyl alcohol. The cells were washed with water and photographed under a light microscope. To assess the effect of ASXL knockdown on adipogenesis, the 3T3-L1 cells were transfected with ASXL siRNA before differentiation was induced, as described above. The siRNA was also added to the fresh medium replaced every 2 days during differentiation. ChIP analysis was performed as described previously (28Lee S.W. Cho Y.S. Na J.M. Park U.H. Kang M. Kim E.J. Um S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 18-29Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Mock-transfected 3T3-L1 cells or 3T3-L1 cells stably expressing FLAG-ASXL1 or FLAG-ASXL2 were induced to differentiate, as described above. Cross-linked, immunoprecipitated chromatin complexes were recovered by IP with anti-FLAG and other indicated antibodies. Cross-linking was then reversed according to the protocol provided by Upstate. The DNA pellets were recovered and analyzed by PCR or real time qPCR using a primer pair encompassing the aP2 promoter region, 5′-AAATTCAGAAGAAAGTAAACACATTATT-3′ (forward) and 5′-ATGCCCTGACCATGTGA-3′ (reverse). Fold enrichment ratios were calculated from Ct values normalized against Ct of IgG control. Percentage of input was calculated compared with input sample used in qPCR. Relative occupancy is the fold-increase in the percentage of input over that of day 0 (set to 1). TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) was used to extract RNA from 3T3-L1 cells stably expressing FLAG, FLAG-ASXL1, or FLAG-ASXL2 after differentiation for 8 days as described above. The 3T3-L1/FLAG and 3T3-L1/FLAG-ASXL1 or -ASXL2 RNA samples were labeled with Cy3 (FLAG and FLAG-ASXL1) or Cy5 (FLAG-ASXL2). Labeled samples were hybridized to an Agilent Mouse 44k 4plex microarray (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The Lowess (locally weighted linear regression curve fit) and dye-swap normalization methods were applied to the Cy5/Cy3 ratio of the microarray signal intensities, and the results were filtered with a cutoff at p < 0.05. Genes exhibiting significant differences in expression level were classified by referring to the Gene Ontology, KEGG, and DAVID Bioinformatics Resources databases. Results were evaluated with Student's t test for the two groups and are presented as means ± S.D. Our previous findings concerning the roles of ASXL1 in retinoic acid receptor regulation (27Cho Y.S.

The functional domains of ASXL1 and ASXL2 are shown in Fig. 1A. Whereas both proteins contain nuclear receptor-binding motifs, only ASXL1 harbors an HP1-binding motif. This motif is critical for retinoic acid receptor repression (28Lee S.W. Cho Y.S. Na J.M. Park U.H. Kang M. Kim E.J. Um S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 18-29Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and the ASXL1ΔHP1 mutant, which lacks this motif, is defective in HP1 binding (28Lee S.W. Cho Y.S. Na J.M. Park U.H. Kang M. Kim E.J. Um S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 18-29Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To examine the physical interactions between ASXL and PPAR proteins in vitro and in vivo, we performed GST pulldown and co-IP assays, respectively. For GST pulldown assays, GST-ASXL1 and GST-ASXL1 fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli, purified, and mixed with in vitro translated FLAG-PPARα or FLAG-PPARγ in the absence and presence of ligands. Subsequent Western blotting with anti-FLAG antibody indicated that ASXL1 and ASXL2 both interact with PPARα and PPARγ in a ligand-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). For co-IP assays, HEK293 cells, which express very low levels of PPARγ, were transfected with a vector expressing FLAG-PPARγ. After the expression of PPARγ, ASXL1, and ASXL2 was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 1C, upper panel), the PPARγ-linked complexes were immunoprecipitated with anti-PPARγ antibody and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-ASXL1 and -ASXL2 antibodies. As shown in the lower panel of Fig. 1C, this analysis showed that PPARγ interacts with ASXL1 and ASXL2 in a rosiglitazone-dependent manner. No precipitation of ASXL1 or ASXL2 was detectable when an IgG control antibody was used for the immunoprecipitation. To determine the significance of the physical interactions between ASXL proteins and PPARγ, we examined the roles of ASXL1 and ASXL2 in PPARγ-mediated transcription. In luciferase reporter assays carried out in transfected HEK293 cells, ASXL1 strongly inhibited the rosiglitazone induction of PPARγ transcriptional activity, whereas ASXL2 significantly increased it, and both effects were dose-dependent (Fig. 2A). To confirm the reciprocal effects of ASXL1 and ASXL2 on PPARγ-mediated luciferase reporter activity, we used real time RT-qPCR to monitor the expression of two endogenous PPARγ-responsive genes, aP2 and LPL, in HEK293 cells under ASXL overexpression or knockdown conditions. ASXL1 and ASXL2 expressions were monitored by Western blotting using anti-FLAG, anti-ASXL1, and anti-ASXL2 antibodies (Fig. 2B). As shown in Fig. 2C, the rosiglitazone-induced expression of aP2 and LPL mRNA was almost completely abolished in ASXL1-overexpressing cells but was greatly increased in ASXL2-overexpressing cells. Conversely, siRNA-mediated knockdown of ASXL1 expression significantly increased PPARγ-mediated gene expression, whereas knockdown of ASXL2 expression significantly decreased it (Fig. 2D). Overall, these results demonstrate that the rosiglitazone-induced transcriptional activity of PPARγ is negatively regulated by ASXL1 but positively regulated by ASXL2. To assess whether the differential regulation of PPARγ by ASXLs is functionally linked to their roles in adipocyte differentiation, 3T3-L1 cell lines constitutively expressing FLAG-ASXL1, FLAG-ASXL1ΔHP1, or FLAG-ASXL2 were generated by stable transfection. Expression of these constructs was confirmed by Western blotting with anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 3A). Then the effect of ASXL expression on PPARγ activity was monitored by RT-PCR 5 days after adipogenesis was induced using a differentiation-inducing mixture containing rosiglitazone (Fig. 3B). As expected from the results shown in Fig. 2, ASXL1 overexpression repressed rosiglitazone induction of expression of the PPARγ target genes aP2 and LPL, whereas ASXL2 overexpression greatly enhanced this induction (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, deletion of the HP1 box from ASXL1 greatly enhanced PPARγ transcriptional activity, suggesting that the HP1 box is required for the repression activity of ASXL1 and that the ASXL1ΔHP1 mutant functions as a dominant-negative regulator or as a coactivator like ASXL2. Consistent with the RT-PCR analyses, Oil Red O staining under conditions identical to those described above indicated that the stable expression of FLAG-ASXL1, but not FLAG alone, blocked 3T3-L1 cell differentiation into adipocytes (Fig. 3C). However, the stable expression of FLAG-ASXL2 or FLAG-ASXL1ΔHP1 resulted in significantly enhanced differentiation. To verify the physiological roles of ASXL1 and ASXL2 in adipogenesis, we examined ASXL levels every other day during 3T3-L1 cell differentiation by Western blotting. Whereas the ASXL1 level decreased gradually during adipocyte differentiation, the ASXL2 level remained relatively constant, and the PPARγ protein level increased (Fig. 4A). The amount of aP2 mRNA also increased during differentiation (Fig. 4A). These results prompted u"

However, there is no systematic way to measure and predict the action of such materials in biological contexts. Lipid-encapsulated nanoparticles (NPs) are a class of nanomaterials that includes the liposomes, the most widely used and clinically proven type of NPs. Liposomes can, however, activate the complement system, an important branch of innate immunity, resulting in undesirable consequences. Here, we describe the complement response to lipid-encapsulated NPs that are functionalized on the surface with various lipid-anchored gadolinium chelates. We developed a quantitative approach to examine the interaction of NPs with the complement system using in vitro assays and correlating these results with those obtained in an in vivo mouse model. Our results indicate that surface functionalization of NPs with certain chemical structures elicits swift complement activation that is initiated by a natural IgM antibody and propagated via the classical pathway. The intensity of the response is dependent on the chemical structures of the lipid-anchored chelates and not zeta potential effects alone. Moreover, the extent of complement activation may be tempered by complement inhibiting regulatory proteins that bind to the surface of NPs. These findings represent a step forward in the understanding of the interactions between nanomaterials and the host innate immune response and provide the basis for a systematic structure-activity relationship study to establish guidelines that are critical to the future development of biocompatible nanotherapeutics."

Both C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) and Elk1 are required for celecoxib-induced DR5 expression based on promoter deletion and mutation analysis and siRNA-mediated gene silencing results. Co-expression of both CHOP and Elk1 exhibited enhanced effects on increasing DR5 promoter activity and DR5 expression, indicating that CHOP and Elk1 co-operatively regulate DR5 expression. Because Elk1 is an ERK-regulated protein, we accordingly found that celecoxib increased the levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2, RSK2, and Elk1.

https://openalex.org/W1999996046,"The parathyroid hormone (PTH)/PTH-related peptide (PTHrP) receptor (PTHR1) in cells of the renal proximal tubule mediates the reduction in membrane expression of the sodium-dependent P(i) co-transporters, NPT2a and NPT2c, and thus suppresses the re-uptake of P(i) from the filtrate. In most cell types, the liganded PTHR1 activates Gα(S)/adenylyl cyclase/cAMP/PKA (cAMP/PKA) and Gα(q/11)/phospholipase C/phosphatidylinositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP(3))/Ca(2+)/PKC (IP(3)/PKC) signaling pathways, but the relative roles of each pathway in mediating renal regulation P(i) transport remain uncertain. We therefore explored the signaling mechanisms involved in PTH-dependent regulation of NPT2a function using potent, long-acting PTH analogs, M-PTH(1-28) (where M = Ala(1,12), Aib(3), Gln(10), Har(11), Trp(14), and Arg(19)) and its position 1-modified variant, Trp(1)-M-PTH(1-28), designed to be phospholipase C-deficient. In cell-based assays, both M-PTH(1-28) and Trp(1)-M-PTH(1-28) exhibited potent and prolonged cAMP responses, whereas only M-PTH(1-28) was effective in inducing IP(3) and intracellular calcium responses. In opossum kidney cells, a clonal cell line in which the PTHR1 and NPT2a are endogenously expressed, M-PTH(1-28) and Trp(1)-M-PTH(1-28) each induced reductions in (32)P uptake, and these responses persisted for more than 24 h after ligand wash-out, whereas that of PTH(1-34) was terminated by 4 h. When injected into wild-type mice, both M-modified PTH analogs induced prolonged reductions in blood P(i) levels and commensurate reductions in NPT2a expression in the renal brush border membrane. Our findings suggest that the acute down-regulation of NPT2a expression by PTH ligands involves mainly the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway and are thus consistent with the elevated blood P(i) levels seen in pseudohypoparathyroid patients, in whom Gα(s)-mediated signaling in renal proximal tubule cells is defective."

In this study, we report the crystal structure of hPPO in complex with the coenzyme flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and the inhibitor acifluorfen at a resolution of 1.9 Å. The structural and biochemical analyses revealed the molecular details of FAD and acifluorfen binding to hPPO as well as the interactions of the substrate with hPPO. Structural analysis and gel chromatography indicated that hPPO is a monomer rather than a homodimer in vitro. The founder-effect mutation R59W in VP patients is most likely caused by a severe electrostatic hindrance in the hydrophilic binding pocket involving the bulky, hydrophobic indolyl ring of the tryptophan.

https://openalex.org/W2062275190,"The last step of sulfur assimilation is catalyzed by O-acetylserine(thiol)lyase (OASTL) enzymes. OASTLs are encoded by a multigene family in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Cytosolic OASA1 enzyme is the main source of OASTL activity and thus crucial for cysteine homeostasis. We found that nitrating conditions after exposure to peroxynitrite strongly inhibited OASTL activity. Among OASTLs, OASA1 was markedly sensitive to nitration as demonstrated by the comparative analysis of OASTL activity in nitrated crude protein extracts from wild type and different oastl mutants. Furthermore, nitration assays on purified recombinant OASA1 protein led to 90% reduction of the activity due to inhibition of the enzyme, as no degradation of the protein occurred under these conditions. The reduced activity was due to nitration of the protein because selective scavenging of peroxynitrite with epicatechin impaired OASA1 nitration and the concomitant inhibition of OASTL activity. Inhibition of OASA1 activity upon nitration correlated with the identification of a modified OASA1 protein containing 3-nitroTyr(302) residue. The essential role of the Tyr(302) residue for the catalytic activity was further demonstrated by the loss of OASTL activity of a Y302A-mutated version of OASA1. Inhibition caused by Tyr(302) nitration on OASA1 activity seems to be due to a drastically reduced O-acetylserine substrate binding to the nitrated protein, and also to reduced stabilization of the pyridoxal-5'-phosphate cofactor through hydrogen bonds. This is the first report identifying a Tyr nitration site of a plant protein with functional effect and the first post-translational modification identified in OASA1 enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2085187903,"Insulin-dependent glucose homeostasis is highly sensitive to the levels of insulin-responsive glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) expression in adipocytes. The level of GLUT4 protein expression is highly dependent on the rate of GLUT4 gene transcription. GLUT4 gene transcription is decreased in a variety of physiologic states of insulin resistance including type 2 diabetes, obesity, and prolonged fasting. GLUT4 gene expression in adipocytes is differentiation-dependent, with full expression delayed until late in the differentiation program. In this paper, we have tested the hypothesis that differentiation-dependent GLUT4 gene expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes is dependent on the nuclear concentration of a class II histone deacetylase (HDAC) protein, HDAC5. We have tested this hypothesis by reducing the levels of class II HDACs in the nuclear compartment of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes using two experimental approaches. First, preadipocytes were treated with phenylephrine, an α-adrenergic receptor agonist, to drive HDACS out of the nuclear compartment. Also, the class II HDAC concentrations were reduced using siRNA knockdown. In each case, reduction of nuclear class II HDAC concentration resulted in increased expression of endogenous GLUT4 mRNA in preadipocytes. Together, our data indicate that class II HDAC expression is the major regulatory mechanism for inhibiting GLUT4 expression in the predifferentiated state."

Although the molecular mechanism for this metabolic switch to aerobic glycolysis has not been fully elucidated, it is likely that mitochondrial damage to the electron transport chain and the resulting increased production of reactive oxygen species are significant driving forces. In this study, we have investigated the role of the transcription factor Ets-1 in the regulation of mitochondrial function and metabolism. Ets-1 was over-expressed using a stably-incorporated tetracycline-inducible expression vector in the ovarian cancer cell line 2008, which does not express detectable basal levels of Ets-1 protein. Microarray analysis of the effects of Ets-1 over-expression in these ovarian cancer cells shows that Ets-1 up-regulates key enzymes involved in glycolysis and associated feeder pathways, fatty acid metabolism, and antioxidant defense. In contrast, Ets-1 down-regulates genes involved in the citric acid cycle, electron transport chain, and mitochondrial proteins. At the functional level, we have found that Ets-1 expression is directly correlated with cellular oxygen consumption whereby increased expression causes decreased oxygen consumption. Ets-1 over-expression also caused increased sensitivity to glycolytic inhibitors, as well as growth inhibition in a glucose-depleted culture environment. Collectively our findings demonstrate that Ets-1 is involved in the regulation of cellular metabolism and response to oxidative stress in ovarian cancer cells."

To uncover candidate therapeutic targets and networks involved in pathogenesis, we integrated gene expression profiling and functional genetic screening to identify genes critical for mutant htt toxicity in yeast. Using mRNA profiling, we have identified genes differentially expressed in wild-type yeast in response to mutant htt toxicity as well as in three toxicity suppressor strains: bna4Δ, mbf1Δ, and ume1Δ. BNA4 encodes the yeast homolog of kynurenine 3-monooxygenase, a promising drug target for HD. Intriguingly, despite playing diverse cellular roles, these three suppressors share common differentially expressed genes involved in stress response, translation elongation, and mitochondrial transport. We then systematically tested the ability of the differentially expressed genes to suppress mutant htt toxicity when overexpressed and have thereby identified 12 novel suppressors, including genes that play a role in stress response, Golgi to endosome transport, and rRNA processing. Integrating the mRNA profiling data and the genetic screening data, we have generated a robust network that shows enrichment in genes involved in rRNA processing and ribosome biogenesis. Strikingly, these observations implicate dysfunction of translation in the pathology of HD. Recent work has shown that regulation of translation is critical for life span extension in Drosophila and that manipulation of this process is protective in Parkinson disease models. In total, these observations suggest that pharmacological manipulation of translation may have therapeutic value in HD."

Surprisingly, decreased phosphorylation after ligand perturbation was more common than increased phosphorylation. In particular, 17β-estradiol induced down-regulation in WT cells at a very high rate. 17β-Estradiol and the ErbB ligand heregulin induced almost equal numbers of up-regulated phospho-proteins in WT cells. Pathway and motif activity analyses using transcriptome data additionally suggested that deregulated activation of GSK3β (glycogen-synthase kinase 3β) and MAPK1/3 signaling might be associated with altered activation of cAMP-responsive element-binding protein and AP-1 transcription factors in tamoxifen-resistant cells, and this hypothesis was validated by reporter assays. An examination of clinical samples revealed that inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK3β at serine 9 was significantly lower in tamoxifen-treated breast cancer patients that eventually had relapses, implying that activation of GSK3β may be associated with the tamoxifen-resistant phenotype. Thus, the combined phosphoproteome and transcriptome data set analyses revealed distinct signal transcription programs in tumor cells and provided a novel molecular target to understand tamoxifen resistance."

In the resting (immature) state, MHC-II is ubiquitinated in immature DCs and is rapidly degraded; however, after activation of these cells with MyD88-dependent TLR ligands, MHC-II ubiquitination is blocked, and MHC-II survival is prolonged. We now show that DC activation using MyD88-dependent TLR ligands, MyD88-independent TLR ligands, and even infection with the intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii leads to identical changes in MHC-II expression, ubiquitination, and surface stability, revealing a conserved role for enhanced MHC-II stability after DC activation by different stimuli.

A major function of DCs is to capture, process, and present antigens to T cells (1.Banchereau J. Steinman R.M. Nature. 1998; 392: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (12151) Google Scholar). To perform this task, DCs possess MHC class II (MHC-II) proteins onto which processed antigens are loaded (2.Trombetta E.S. Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 23: 975-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). The peptide-MHC-II (pMHC-II) complexes are subsequently transported to the cell surface, where they are presented to CD4+ T cells. In the resting (immature) state, DCs are relatively poor activators of T cells; however, T cell-stimulating activity dramatically improves when DCs receive a maturation signal. Upon receipt of such a signal, DCs go through profound changes, including increased surface expression of molecules important for T cell activation, such as pMHC-II and the co-stimulatory molecules CD40 and CD86 (1.Banchereau J. Steinman R.M. Nature. 1998; 392: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (12151) Google Scholar). Chemokine receptor expression pattern is also modified upon DC activation, resulting in efficient recruitment of DCs to secondary lymphoid tissues, where they encounter T cells and initiate appropriate immune responses.Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are expressed on antigen-presenting cells, and these TLRs trigger DC activation after they bind to pathogen-associated molecular patterns present on microorganisms (3.Hemmi H. Akira S. Chem. Immunol. Allergy. 2005; 86: 120-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). There are 13 known TLRs found in mammals, and they can be found on the plasma membrane as well as in intracellular compartments. Pathogen-associated molecular patterns are typically conserved structures found in microorganisms, and when TLRs bind a pathogen-associated molecular pattern, a signaling cascade is initiated that leads to up-regulation of molecules and cytokines that will fight and eliminate the encountered microorganisms.The ligands that bind TLRs vary and include cell wall components of Gram-negative bacterial LPS for TLR4 and Gram-positive bacterial peptidoglycan (PGN) for TLR2, single-stranded RNA for TLR7/8, double-stranded RNA (or poly(I:C)) for TLR3, and unmethylated bacterial CpG DNA for TLR9 (3.Hemmi H. Akira S. Chem. Immunol. Allergy. 2005; 86: 120-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The immune response following TLR activation also varies depending on the nature of the ligand and results in a myriad of different immunological consequences depending on the particular TLR stimulated.All TLR family members signal using adaptor molecules upon ligand binding. Four cytosolic adaptor molecules are thought to play a crucial role in the specificity of the individual TLR-mediated signaling pathway: MyD88, MAL (MyD88 adaptor-like), TRIF (Toll/IL-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor-inducing IFN-beta), and TRAM (TRIF-related adaptor molecule) (4.McGettrick A.F. O'Neill L.A. Mol. Immunol. 2004; 41: 577-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar).

We used LPS (TLR4), PGN (TLR2), and poly(I:C) (TLR3) as TLR ligands. We also infected DCs with the intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii, a pathogen that is known to stimulate DCs but whose mechanism of action on human DCs remains unknown. By assaying for up-regulation of MHC-II and CD86 on the cell surface, survival of MHC-II on the surface, and ubiquitination of pMHC-II, we found that regardless of the TLRs activated (both MyD88-dependent and MyD88-independent), the maturation of DCs followed the same pattern with up-regulation of pMHC-II and CD86 on the cell surface, cessation of MHC-II ubiquitination, and prolonged survival of plasma membrane MHC-II. These data strongly suggest that stabilization of MHC-II appears to be a highly conserved feature common to all forms of DC activation.

https://openalex.org/W2066684479,"Background Human beta-defensins (hBDs) are antimicrobial peptides known to play a major role in intestinal innate host defence. Altered mucosal expression of hBDs has been suggested to be implicated in chronic inflammatory bowel disease pathogenesis. However, little is known about expression of these peptides in children. Methods Intestinal biopsies were obtained from the duodenum (n = 88), terminal ileum (n = 90) and ascending colon (n = 105) of children with Crohn's disease (n = 26), ulcerative colitis (n = 11) and healthy controls (n = 16). Quantitative real-time (RT) PCR was performed and absolute mRNA copy numbers analyzed for hBD1-3 as well as inflammatory cytokines IL-8 and TNF-alpha. Results Significant induction of hBD2 and hBD3 was observed in the inflamed terminal ileum and ascending colon of IBD children. In the ascending colon induction of hBD2 was found to be significantly lower in children with Crohn's disease compared to ulcerative colitis. A strong correlation was found between inducible defensins hBD2 and 3 and the inflammatory cytokines IL-8 and TNF-alpha, both in the terminal ileum and ascending colon. Conclusion Our study demonstrates distinct changes in hBD expression throughout the intestinal tract of children with IBD, lending further support for their potential role in disease pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2094246368,"Phagocytosis of foreign pathogens by cells of the immune system is a vitally important function of innate immunity. The phagocytic response is initiated when ligands on the surface of invading microorganisms come in contact with receptors on the surface of phagocytic cells such as neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages, and dendritic cells. The complement receptor CR3 (CD11b/CD18, Mac-1) mediates the phagocytosis of complement protein (C3bi)-coated particles. Fcγ receptors (FcγRs) bind IgG-opsonized particles and provide a mechanism for immune clearance and phagocytosis of IgG-coated particles. We have observed that stimulation of FcγRs modulates CR3-mediated phagocytosis and that FcγRIIA and FcγRI exert opposite (stimulatory and inhibitory) effects. We have also determined that an intact FcγR immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif is required for these effects, and we have investigated the involvement of downstream effectors. The ability to up-regulate or down-regulate CR3 signaling has important implications for therapeutics in disorders involving the host defense system."
https://openalex.org/W2059410615,"Wnt signaling pathways are involved in embryonic development and adult tissue maintenance and have been implicated in tumorigenesis. Dishevelled (Dvl/Dsh) protein is one of key components in Wnt signaling and plays essential roles in regulating these pathways through protein-protein interactions. Identifying and characterizing Dvl-binding proteins are key steps toward understanding biological functions. Given that the tripeptide VWV (Val-Trp-Val) binds to the PDZ domain of Dvl, we searched publically available databases to identify proteins containing the VWV motif at the C terminus that could be novel Dvl-binding partners. On the basis of the cellular localization and expression patterns of the candidates, we selected for further study the TMEM88 (target protein transmembrane 88), a two-transmembrane-type protein. The interaction between the PDZ domain of Dvl and the C-terminal tail of TMEM88 was confirmed by using NMR and fluorescence spectroscopy. Furthermore, in HEK293 cells, TMEM88 attenuated the Wnt/β-catenin signaling induced by Wnt-1 ligand in a dose-dependent manner, and TMEM88 knockdown by RNAi increased Wnt activity. In Xenopus, TMEM88 protein is sublocalized at the cell membrane and inhibits Wnt signaling induced by Xdsh but not β-catenin. In addition, TMEM88 protein inhibits the formation of a secondary axis normally induced by Xdsh. The findings suggest that TMEM88 plays a role in regulating Wnt signaling. Indeed, analysis of microarray data revealed that the expression of the Tmem88 gene was strongly correlated with that of Wnt signaling-related genes in embryonic mouse intestines. Together, we propose that TMEM88 associates with Dvl proteins and regulates Wnt signaling in a context-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W2068451350,"Hepatocyte nuclear factor-4α (HNF4α, NR2A1) is a nuclear receptor that has a critical role in hepatocyte differentiation and the maintenance of homeostasis in the adult liver. However, a detailed understanding of native HNF4α in the steady-state remains to be elucidated. Here we report the native HNF4α isoform, phosphorylation status, and complexes in the steady-state, as shown by shotgun proteomics in HepG2 hepatocarcinoma cells. Shotgun proteomic analysis revealed the complexity of native HNF4α, including multiple phosphorylation sites and inter-isoform heterodimerization. The associating complexes identified by label-free semiquantitative proteomic analysis include the following: the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit, histone acetyltransferase complexes, mRNA splicing complex, other nuclear receptor coactivator complexes, the chromatin remodeling complex, and the nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylation complex. Among the associating proteins, GRB10 interacting GYF protein 2 (GIGYF2, PERQ2) is a new candidate cofactor in metabolic regulation. Moreover, an unexpected heterodimerization of HNF4α and hepatocyte nuclear factor-4γ was found. A biochemical and genomewide analysis of transcriptional regulation showed that this heterodimerization activates gene transcription. The genes thus transcribed include the cell death-inducing DEF45-like effector b (CIDEB) gene, which is an important regulator of lipid metabolism in the liver.

The key factors in the wide diversity of the HNF4α-regulated transcriptional machinery are the phosphorylation and isoform states along with cofactor interactions. The phosphorylation of HNF4α regulates specific genes by affecting DNA binding and/or cofactor recruitment (15Guo H. Gao C. Mi Z. Wai P.Y. Kuo P.C. Biochem.

In the commonly postulated NR mechanism, ligand binding induces the replacement of a histone deacetylase complex with a histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complex, with binding taking place through the NR-coregulator interaction motifs together with the activation function 2 domain (26Perissi V. Rosenfeld M.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 542-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Recent reports showed that the cofactor-mediated function results in histone modification, regulation of chromatin conformation, and immature mRNA metabolism (27Rosenfeld M.G. Lunyak V.V. Glass C.K. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 1405-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). Whereas these key factors might be linked with each other and have a central role in the fine tuning of the multiple transcriptional regulation activities performed by HNF4α, the details of the steady-state of native HNF4α are, as yet, poorly understood. Hepatocyte nuclear factor-4γ (HNF4γ, NR2A2) is a member of the HNF4 orphan subfamily expressed in the pancreas, kidney, small intestine, and testis (28Drewes T. Senkel S. Holewa B. Ryffel G.U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 925-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Whereas an early report suggested there was no expression in the human liver (28Drewes T. Senkel S. Holewa B. Ryffel G.U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 925-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), other groups subsequently reported expression at the mRNA level (29Ozeki T. Takahashi Y. Nakayama K. Funayama M.

The gene regulation effected by HNF4γ has been reported to take place in coordination with HNF4α (31Archer A. Sauvaget D. Chauffeton V. Bouchet P.E. Chambaz J. Pinçon-Raymond M. Cardot P. Ribeiro A.

In the study of Bogan et al. (34Bogan A.A. Dallas-Yang Q. Ruse Jr., M.D. Maeda Y. Jiang G. Nepomuceno L. Scanlan T.S. Cohen F.E. Sladek F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 831-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), they predicted the heterodimerization of HNF4α and HNF4γ through K(X)26E motifs on the E domain. Here, we investigated the steady-state native HNF4α isoform, as well as the phosphorylation state and interacting complex, by shotgun proteomics and label-free semiquantitative proteomic analysis using specific antibodies and low noise magnetic beads. Moreover, by utilizing the complex database, we were able to categorize the cofactors into functional complexes. The data indicate the complexity of the native HNF4α states and cofactors obtained via stoichiometry. In confirmation of this proteomic analysis, we unexpectedly demonstrated HNF4α and HNF4γ heterodimerization and transcriptional activation. The regulatory genes shown here include an important regulator of lipid metabolism in the liver. The results support the concept that the fine tuning of the multiple transcriptional regulation activities arose from a distinctive stoichiometric balancing of the nuclear receptor and interacting cofactors. The application of this method to dynamic proteomics should help provide a means to obtain an adequate understanding of transcriptional regulation in extracellular/intracellular signaling and/or the developmental cascade. Mouse monoclonal antibody H1415 (IgG2a) directed against the F domain, K9218 (IgG2a) directed against the P1-driven A/B domain, H6939 (IgG1) directed against the P2-driven A/B domain of human HNF4α, and B6502A (IgG1) directed against human HNF4γ, were raised in our laboratory by immunizing separate mice with peptides representing residues 394 to 461 of human HNF4α isoform 2, 3 to 49 of human HNF4α isoform 2, 1 to 16 of human HNF4α isoform 7, and 91 to 212 of human HNF4γ, respectively. Magnetic beads with Protein G conjugated on their surface (MagnosphereTM MS300/Protein G, JSR Corp., Japan) were washed twice with PBS, 0.05% Tween 20. The capturing antibody procedure was carried out by adding the antibody at a final ratio of 4 μg of antibody/1 mg of beads with gentle mixing for 40 min at room temperature. After washing twice with PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 followed by 0.2 m triethanolamine-HCl, pH 8.2, the affinity-captured antibody was cross-linked by adding 20 mm dimethyl pimelimidate in 0.2 m triethanolamine-HCl, pH 8.2, with gentle mixing for 30 min at room temperature. After removing the buffer, quenching was carried out by adding Tris-buffered saline with gentle mixing for 15 min at room temperature. After washing twice with PBS, 0.01% Tween 20, antibody cross-linked Protein G-conjugated magnetic beads were suspended with PBS, 0.01% Tween 20 and stored at 4 °C. HepG2 cells were grown as previously described (35Sumi K. Tanaka T. Uchida A. Magoori K. Urashima Y. Ohashi R. Ohguchi H. Okamura M. Kudo H. Daigo K. Maejima T. Kojima N. Sakakibara I. Jiang S.

HepG2 nuclear extract was prepared described by Dignam et al. (36Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9150) Google Scholar), with minor changes. All steps were carried out at 4 °C. The culture medium was removed from HepG2 cell cultures grown to 80–90% confluence. The cells were gently rinsed with ice-cold PBS, 0.2 mm PMSF and harvested by scraping into fresh ice-cold PBS, 0.2 mm PMSF. Harvested cells were collected by centrifugation for 10 min at 1,850 × g and resuspended in a 5 packed cell volume of hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, at 4 °C, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.2 mm PMSF, 0.5 mm DTT). Suspension cells were again collected by centrifugation for 5 min at 1,850 × g and resuspended in hypotonic buffer to a final volume of 3 packed cell volume. The cells were transferred to a glass Dounce homogenizer after incubating on ice for 10 min and homogenized using a loose pestle with 25 to 30 gentle strokes. When cell lysis reached 80%, the nuclei were collected by centrifugation for 15 min at 3,300 × g. The nuclei pellet was resuspended in 1/2 packed nuclear volume of low-salt buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, at 4 °C, 25% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm PMSF, 0.5 mm DTT). In terms of the nuclear extract preparation, 1/2 packed nuclear volume of high-salt buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, at 4 °C, 25% glycerol, 1.2 m MgCl2, 20 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm PMSF, 0.5 mm DTT) was added to the nuclei suspension in a dropwise fashion over a period of 1 h with gentle stirring, and then continuously stirred gently for 30 min at 4 °C. The extract was centrifuged 30 min at 25,000 × g to remove debris, and the supernatant was dialyzed against a sufficient volume of dialysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, at 4 °C, 10% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm PMSF) for 5 h. The dialyzed extract was centrifuged for 20 min at 25,000 × g, and the pellet was discarded. Aliquots of the supernatant were frozen with liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C as the nuclear extract. Before affinity purification, the HepG2 nuclear extract was thawed on ice, added at the final concentration of 0.1% Nonidet P-40, centrifuged 15 min at 20,000 × g, and the pellet was discarded. Supernatant was passed through a 0.22-μm filter and incubated with 0.5 mg of the antibody cross-linked Protein G-conjugated magnetic beads for 4 h at 4 °C. Magnet beads were washed 3 times with 0.1 m KCl-HEGN (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, at 4 °C, 0.1 m KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.2 mm PMSF) and once with 50 mm NH4HCO3 buffer at 4 °C. The affinity purified proteins were eluted by 0.05% RapiGest (Waters) in 50 mm NH4HCO3 buffer for 30 min at 67 °C. Eluent was concentrated by 10% ice-cold TCA, washed with ice-cold acetone, and dried. All magnetic bead operations for affinity purification were carried out with a Magnatrix 1200 (Precision System Science) magnetic bead reaction system. The immunoprecipitation (IP) samples concentrated by TCA precipitation were resuspended in 25% (v/v) CH3CN, 25 mm NH4HCO3 buffer. The samples were reduced in 1.2 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine for 15 min at 50 °C and alkylated in 3 mm iodoacetamide for 30 min at room temperature, respectively. The samples were digested overnight with 100 ng of trypsin (Promega) at 37 °C. After drying with a SpeedVac (ThermoFisher Scientific) to reduce the CH3CN concentration, peptides were dissolved in 0.2% TFA, 2% CH3CN solution and incubated for 60 min at 37 °C for residual RapiGest degradation. After incubation, samples were centrifuged to remove precipitates. A capillary reverse phase HPLC-MS/MS system (ZAPLOUS System; AMR Inc.), comprised of a Paradigm MS4 quadra solvent delivery device (Michrom BioResources), an HTC PAL autosampler (CTC Analytics), and Finnigan LTQ orbitrap XL mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) equipped with an XYZ nanoelectrospray ionization source (AMR Inc.), was used for LC/MS/MS analysis. Aliquots of trypsinized samples were automatically injected onto a peptide CapTrap cartridge (2.0 × 0.5 mm inner diameter, Michrom BioResources) attached to an injector valve for desalting and concentrating the peptides. After washing the trap with 98% H2O, 2% AcCN, 0.2% TFA, the peptides were loaded into a separation capillary reverse phase column (Monocap C18 150 × 0.2 mm inner diameter, GL-Science) by switching the valve. The eluents used were: A, 98% H2O, 2% AcCN, 0.1% HCOOH; and B, 10% H2O, 90% AcCN, 0.1% HCOOH. The column was developed at the flow rate of 1.0 μl/min, with a concentration gradient of AcCN: from 5% B to 35% B for 100 min, then from 35% B to 95% B for 1 min, maintained in 95% B for 9 min, from 95% B to 5% B for 1 min, and finally re-equilibrating with 5% B for 9 min. Effluents were introduced into the mass spectrometer via the nanoelectrospray ion interface that held the separation column outlet directly connected with an nanoelectrospray ionization needle (PicoTip FS360–50-30; New Objective Inc.). The ESI voltage was 2.0 kV and the transfer capillary of the LTQ inlet was heated to 200 °C. No sheath or auxiliary gas was used. The mass spectrometer was operated in a data-dependent acquisition mode, in which the MS acquisition with a mass range of m/z 420–1600 was automatically switched to MS/MS acquisition under the automated control of Xcalibur software. The top 4 precursor ions were selected by an MS scan, with Orbitrap at a resolution of r = 60000, and for the subsequent MS/MS scans by ion trap in the normal/centroid mode, using the automated gain control (AGC) mode with AGC values of 5.00 × 105 and 1.00 × 104 for full MS and MS/MS, respectively. We also employed a dynamic exclusion capability that allowed sequential acquisition of the MS/MS of abundant ions in the order of their intensities with an exclusion duration of 2.0 min, and exclusion mass widths of −5 and +5 ppm. The trapping time was 100 ms with the auto gain control on. For the identification of the phosphorylation- and isoform-specific HNF4α peptide, MS/MS data were processed with Mascot® software (version 2.1.04, Matrix Science) against the NCBInr data base (AddGene Nr_Human 189494 sequences; Maze) at a peptide mass tolerance of 3 ppm and fragment mass tolerance of 0.8 Da, taking into account fixed peptide modification by carbamidomethyl (C), variable peptide modifications by methionine oxidation, as well as phosphorylation, including phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine. The analysis of the data was carried out with Scaffold software (Proteome Software). For the label-free semiquantitative proteomic analysis, the SwissProt 57.3 Homo sapiens database (20,405 sequences) was used. The cut-off score was 35. The label-free semiquantitative values were determined using the Expressionist Refiner MS software (GeneData). After pre-processing (noise subtraction, RT alignment, and peak detection) and importing the identification results from the Mascot software, the relative ion intensities were calculated and normalized by the Lowess normalization method. The intensities of ions having the same calculated mass ±0.01 Da with different charges were summed. p values were calculated using two-way factorial analysis of variance. First, the 302 complex lists containing the protein(s) with analysis of variance p values ≤ 0.000001, the assigned picomole in terms of both of the anti-HNF4α antibodies ≥0.05, and the assigned picomole in terms of control IgG ≤0.05, were extracted from the Human Protein Reference Database (HPRD) (37Mathivanan S.

Then, the complex lists in which the number of proteins in supplemental Data S1C was less than one-third and the assigned total picomole of both of the anti-HNF4α antibodies was less than 1 pmol, were excluded from the first 302 complex lists. Finally, the chosen complex lists were grouped by repeating the following procedure: the complex list that had the highest total assigned picomole of both the anti-HNF4α antibodies was picked; and the complex lists in which over one-half of the proteins were included in the picked complex were extracted and grouped. The expression plasmid of human HNF4α isoform 2 was previously described (38Tanaka T. Jiang S. Hotta H. Takano K. Iwanari H. Sumi K. Daigo K. Ohashi R. Sugai M. Ikegame C. Umezu H. Hirayama Y.

The human HNF4γ cDNA was cloned from HepG2 cell RNA and inserted into the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). All of mutant HNF4α isoform 2 and HNF4γ plasmids were created with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). CHO cells were grown as previously described (35Sumi K. Tanaka T. Uchida A. Magoori K. Urashima Y. Ohashi R. Ohguchi H. Okamura M. Kudo H. Daigo K. Maejima T. Kojima N. Sakakibara I. Jiang S. Hasegawa G. Kim I. Osborne T.F. Naito M. Gonzalez F.J. Hamakubo T.

Co-transfection procedures were performed with the TransIT LT-1 transfection reagent (Mirus Bio LLC) using 4 μg each of the expression vector pairs per plate. After 48 h of co-transfection, cells were gently rinsed with ice-cold PBS, 0.2 mm PMSF and harvested by scraping into fresh ice-cold PBS, 0.2 mm PMSF. Harvested cells were collected by centrifugation for 10 min at 2,000 × g and lysed with lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 0.2 mm PMSF, 0.5 mm DTT, 1 protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Applied Science) per 10 ml). Benzonase nuclease (Novagen) was added to the lysed cells at a final concentration of 25 units/ml and they were incubated on ice for 30 min. The lysate was centrifuged 15 min at 20,000 × g and the pellet was discarded and used for the subsequent IP. Immunofluorescence was performed as previously described (39Sakamoto A. Kawasaki T. Kazawa T. Ohashi R. Jiang S. Maejima T. Tanaka T. Iwanari H. Hamakubo T. Sakai J. Kodama T. Naito M. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2007; 55: 641-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). HepG2 cells plated on chamber slides were fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS for 5 min, permeabilized with 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min on ice, and blocked with PBS containing 10% normal goat serum.

https://openalex.org/W1989901322,"cAMP is an ubiquitous second messenger. Localized areas with high cAMP concentration, i.e. cAMP microdomains, provide an elegant mechanism to generate signaling specificity and transduction efficiency. However, the mechanisms underlying cAMP effector targeting into these compartments is still unclear. Here we report the identification of radixin as a scaffolding unit for both cAMP effectors, Epac and PKA. This complex localizes in a submembrane compartment where cAMP synthesis occurs. Compartment disruption by shRNA and dominant negative approaches negatively affects cAMP action. Inhibition can be rescued by expression of Rap1b, a substrate for both Epac1 and PKA, but only in its GTP-bound and phosphorylated state. We propose that radixin scaffolds both cAMP effectors in a functional cAMP-sensing compartment for efficient signal transduction, using Rap1 as a downstream signal integrator."

The purified and detergent-solubilized protein, which we have named Listeria monocytogenes Ca2+-ATPase 1 (LMCA1), performs a Ca2+-dependent ATP hydrolysis and actively transports Ca2+ after reconstitution in dioleoylphosphatidyl-choline vesicles. Despite a high sequence similarity to the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA1a) and plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase (PMCA), LMCA1 exhibits important biochemical differences such as a low Ca2+ affinity (K0.5 ∼80 μm) and a high pH optimum (pH ∼9). Mutational studies indicate that the unusually high pH optimum can be partially ascribed to the presence of an arginine residue (Arg-795), corresponding in sequence alignments to the Glu-908 position at Ca2+ binding site I of rabbit SERCA1a, but probably with an exposed position in LMCA1. The arginine is characteristic of a large group of putative bacterial Ca2+-ATPases. Moreover, we demonstrate that H+ is countertransported with a transport stoichiometry of 1 Ca2+ out and 1 H+ in per ATP hydrolyzed. The ATPase may serve an important function by removing Ca2+ from the microorganism in environmental conditions when e.g. stressed by high Ca2+ and alkaline pH.

In this study, the role of N-linked glycans in modulating APC endothelial cytoprotective signaling via endothelial cell protein C receptor/protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1) was investigated. Enzymatic digestion of APC N-linked glycans (PNG-APC) decreased the APC concentration required to achieve half-maximal inhibition of thrombin-induced endothelial cell barrier permeability by 6-fold. Furthermore, PNG-APC exhibited increased protection against staurosporine-induced endothelial cell apoptosis when compared with untreated APC. To investigate the specific N-linked glycans responsible, recombinant APC variants were generated in which each N-linked glycan attachment site was eliminated. Of these, APC-N329Q was up to 5-fold more efficient in protecting endothelial barrier function when compared with wild type APC. Based on these findings, an APC variant (APC-L38D/N329Q) was generated with minimal anticoagulant activity, but 5-fold enhanced endothelial barrier protective function and 30-fold improved anti-apoptotic function when compared with wild type APC. These data highlight the previously unidentified role of APC N-linked glycosylation in modulating endothelial cell protein C receptor-dependent cytoprotective signaling via PAR1.

https://openalex.org/W1988090148,"The Toll signaling pathway, an essential innate immune response in invertebrates, is mediated via the serine protease cascade. Once activated, the serine proteases are irreversibly inactivated by serine protease inhibitors (serpins). Recently, we identified three serpin-serine protease pairs that are directly involved in the regulation of Toll signaling cascade in a large beetle, Tenebrio molitor. Of these, the serpin SPN48 was cleaved by its target serine protease, Spätzle-processing enzyme, at a noncanonical P1 residue of the serpin's reactive center loop. To address this unique cleavage, we report the crystal structure of SPN48, revealing that SPN48 exhibits a native conformation of human antithrombin, where the reactive center loop is partially inserted into the center of the largest β-sheet of SPN48. The crystal structure also shows that SPN48 has a putative heparin-binding site that is distinct from those of the mammalian serpins. Ensuing biochemical studies demonstrate that heparin accelerates the inhibition of Spätzle-processing enzyme by a proximity effect in targeting the SPN48. Our finding provides the molecular mechanism of how serpins tightly regulate innate immune responses in invertebrates."

A series of 93 apoA-I variants bearing single nitroxide spin label at positions 6–98 was reconstituted onto 9.6-nm HDL particles (rHDL). These particles were subjected to EPR spectral analysis, measuring regional flexibility and side chain solvent accessibility. Secondary structure was elucidated from side-chain mobility and molecular accessibility, wherein two major α-helical domains were localized to residues 6–34 and 50–98. We identified an unstructured segment (residues 35–39) and a β-strand (residues 40–49) between the two helices. Residues 14, 19, 34, 37, 41, and 58 were examined by EPR on 7.8, 8.4, and 9.6 nm rHDL to assess the effect of particle size on the N-terminal structure.

Protein and lipid oligosaccharide modifying enzymes are part of a complex machinery whose individual components are asymmetrically distributed along the cis/trans axis of the Golgi apparatus. Asymmetry is maintained despite a continuous anterograde membrane flow that moves secretory or membrane-bound cargoes along the secretory pathway, and a continuous COPI vesicle-mediated retrograde transport that moves residents from the late to early Golgi compartment (1.Bonifacino J.S. Glick B.S. Cell. 2004; 116: 153-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar). Fusion of COPI vesicles with target compartments occurs with participation of intra-Golgi soluble NSF attachment protein receptors; recent evidence indicates that this fusion step is preceded by one mediated by close-range acting oligomeric or monomeric tethering factors that may confer specificity to the fusion process. Among the oligomeric tethering factors, the COG (conserved oligomeric Golgi) complex is a soluble hetero-octamer associated to the cytoplasmic surface of the Golgi complex. It has been characterized in yeast (2.Whyte J.R. Munro S. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2627-2637Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and mammalian cells (3.Ungar D. Oka T. Krieger M. Hughson F.M.

Zolov S. Lupashin V. Traffic. 2006; 7: 191-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). COG also facilitates Golgi-ER traffic of some GEARs (COG-sensitive integral membrane proteins resident of the Golgi) that mislocalize and are rapidly degraded in COG mutant cells (16.Oka T. Ungar D.

Landa C.A. Maccioni H.J. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 1131-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) or with 10 μCi/ml of [9,10-3H]palmitic acid (53 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK) to label phospholipids and ceramide. After washing with cold PBS, cells were scrapped from the plate, and lipids were extracted with chloroform:methanol (2:1 by volume) at room temperature for 30 min. Glycolipid composition was examined by HPTLC of the total lipid extract using as solvent chloroform:methanol (4:1 by volume) in a first run up to two-thirds of the plate and chloroform:methanol:0.2% CaCl2 (60:36:8 by volume) in a second run up to the front of the plate. Phospholipid and ceramide composition were examined in the lower phase after a Folch partition of the lipid extract. TLC of phospholipids was carried out using chloroform:methanol:acetic acid:water (40:10:10:1 by volume) as solvent in a first run up to the front of the plate and chloroform:methanol:acetic acid:water (120:46:19:3 by volume) in a second run up to half of the plate. Unlabeled phospholipids were visualized after dipping the chromatograms in 3% cupric acetate in 8% phosphoric acid and heating at 150 °C until development of the bands. For the analysis of lower phase sphingolipids, the lower phase was saponified as follows; it was evaporated to dryness under N2 in glass tubes, taken in 0.1 m KOH in methanol and either neutralized immediately or after keeping for 2 h at 37 °C with the same volume of 0.1 m HCl. Chloroform, methanol, and water were added to achieve a Folch partition, and lipids in the lower phase were run on HPTLC. For sphingophospholipids, the solvent system was as indicated above for total phospholipids. For ceramide separation, the solvent system used was chloroform:acetic acid (9:1 (by volume)). Lipid radioactivity in chromatograms was recorded either by phosphorimaging or by exposure to radiographic films. Densitometric quantification of chromatograms and x-ray plates were done using ImageJ (image processing and Analysis in Java) software (National Institute of Health). Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry of unlabeled lower phase lipids was carried out at the Mass Spectrometry Facility at the University of California (Riverside, CA). All manipulations were done at room temperature unless noted otherwise. Cells were grown on glass coverslips in DMEM medium at 37 °C for 24 h to ∼70% confluence. After washing with PBS, the cells were fixed with 3% formaldehyde in PBS for 20 min, washed with PBS, incubated with 0.1 m NH4Cl in PBS for 20 min, and washed again with PBS. After blocking with 2% BSA in PBS for 1 h, the cells were incubated with lysenin (400 ng/ml in 0.2% BSA/PBS, PeptaNova GmbH, Sandhausen, Germany) for 1 h and washed three times with PBS for 5 min with gentle shaking. Next, they were incubated with rabbit anti-lysenin antiserum (1:500 dilution in 0.2% BSA/PBS, PeptaNova GmbH) for 1 h and washed with PBS, followed by incubation with an appropriate secondary antibody. After washing with PBS, the cells were mounted and observed under a Olympus FluoView™ FV1000 confocal microscope. Confocal images of lysenin-treated WT and ldlC cells were processed with ImageJ software (National Institute of Health). First, images were converted from 12 bits to 8 bits in order to use Counting Particles ImageJ plug-in, and then the same global threshold was defined for WT and ldlC cells. 30 cells were delimited with the free region of interest (ROI) tool of the program, and particles with sizes between 0.1 and 1 μm2 were counted. Homogenates of WT and ldlC cells were used as an enzyme source for determination of sialyltransferase 1 (27.Daniotti J.L. Landa C.A. Maccioni H.J. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 1131-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and SMS (28.Veldman R.J. Mita A. Cuvillier O. Garcia V. Klappe K. Medin J.A. Campbell J.D. Carpentier S. Kok J.W. Levade T. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1144-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) activities. Briefly, sialyltransferase 1 was determined in an incubation system that contained, in a final volume of 30 μl, 400 μm LacCer, 100 μm CMP[3H]NeuAc (250,000 cpm), 20 mm MnCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 20 μg of Triton CF54/Tween 80 (2:1 w/w), 100 mm sodium cacodylate-HCl buffer (pH 6.5), and cell extract (40 μg of protein). Incubations were performed at 37 °C for 90 min. Samples without exogenous acceptor were used to discount the incorporation into endogenous acceptors. Reactions were stopped with 1 ml of 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid/0.5% phosphotungstic acid, and the radioactivity incorporated into lipids was determined as described (29.Daniotti J.L. Landa C.A. Rösner H. Maccioni H.J. J. Neurochem. 1991; 57: 2054-2058Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). For determination of SMS and glucosylceramide synthase activities, the incubation system contained, in a final volume of 50 μl, 20 μm N-6-[(7-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino]hexanoyl-4-d-erythro-sphingosine (C6-NBD-ceramide, Molecular Probes) complexed with bovine serum albumin in a 1:1 molar ratio, 400 μm 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, 400 μm UDP-glucose, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, 1 mm EDTA in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), and cell homogenate (40 μg of protein). After 50 min of incubation at 37 °C, reactions were stopped by the addition of 250 μl of chloroform:methanol 2:1 (v/v) to extract C6-NBD lipids in the lower phase. After centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min, the lower phase was evaporated under nitrogen and subjected to TLC using chloroform:methanol:water (65:25:4, by volume) as solvent. C6-NBD lipids were visualized by UV illumination of the TLC. WT and ldlC cells were cultured 4 h in the presence of 1 μg/ml of C6-NBD-ceramide complexed with bovine serum albumin in a 1:1 molar ratio. After three washes with cold PBS, cells were harvested, and lipids were extracted with chloroform:methanol (2:1 by volume) at room temperature, and the extract was partitioned by adding 0.2 volumes of water. After centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min, the lower phase was evaporated under nitrogen and subjected to HPTLC by using chloroform:methanol:water (65:25:4 by volume) as solvent. C6-NBD lipids present in the chromatograms were visualized by UV illumination of the HPTLC. For Western blot analysis, total protein from cells or cell fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked with 5% (w/v) nonfat dried skim milk in PBS for 1 h at room temperature, followed by three 5-min washes with PBS, and reacted with the following primary antibodies: mouse monoclonal antibody anti-HA (1:1000; Sigma-Aldrich) or mouse monoclonal anti-GFP (1:2000, Roche Applied Science). Goat anti-mouse antibody coupled to IRDye 800 (1:20,000; LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE) was used as secondary antibody. Membranes were then scanned using the Odyssey IR Imager (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). Cog2 null mutant ldlC cells belong to a group of CHO mutant cells deficient in LDL receptor activity. Deficiency is due to its decreased stability as a consequence of abnormal processing of its oligosaccharides in the late stage of Golgi. ldlC cells are able to add high mannose oligosaccharides in N-linked chains to glycoproteins (LDL receptor, vesicular stomatitis virus G protein) but are unable to add sialic acid residues to these oligosaccharide chains and to convert them to completely endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H-resistant forms (11.Kingsley D.M. Kozarsky K.F. Segal M. Krieger M. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1576-1585Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The ldlC phenotype is corrected to the CHO WT phenotype by a cDNA coding for an 83-kDa Golgi-associated, brefeldin A-sensitive peripheral protein, later on referred to as Cog2. The endogenous LDLC mRNA was undetectable in ldlC cells (12.Podos S.D. Reddy P. Ashkenas J. Krieger M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 679-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To investigate the lipid composition of ldlC cells, we carried out long term metabolic labeling of total lipids of CHO WT and ldlC cells in an overnight culture with appropriate radioactive precursors. Lipids were then extracted and analyzed by TLC. The glycolipid fraction was analyzed in the total lipid extract from cells cultured overnight in the presence of [14C]galactose. A relative accumulation of GlcCer (∼1.5-fold higher than in WT cells) and LacCer (∼10-fold higher than in WT cells) and a marked decrease of GM3 (∼5-fold lower than in WT cells) was evident in the chromatogram (Fig. 1A). The phospholipid fraction was analyzed in the lower phase of the lipid extract from cells cultured in the presence of [3H]palmitate, after partition against water. Compared with WT cells, ldlC cells extracts showed essentially no difference in a compound migrating as the standard phosphatidylcholine (PC) but showed a clear decrease of ∼75% of a compound migrating in the chromatogram as the standard SM (Fig. 1B), showing that besides the defects in the glycosylation of glycolipids (11.Kingsley D.M. Kozarsky K.F. Segal M. Krieger M. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1576-1585Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), the composition of other lipids is also affected in ldlC cells. To identify the compound running as SM and partially missing from ldlC cells, the lower phase lipids of both WT and ldlC cells, were subjected to mild alkaline hydrolysis. If, as suspected, this compound is SM, it should be resistant to saponification, whereas the major glycerophospholipid PC should not. It is clear in Fig. 1C that after alkaline hydrolysis, the bands running as PC in both WT and ldlC cells completely disappeared, whereas the bands running as SM remained intact, indicating that the compound is not a glycerolipid and most probably is SM. A liquid chromatography mass spectrometric analysis of lower phase lipids from WT and ldlC cells confirmed that the compound eluted from the liquid chromatograph at the time at which a standard sample of oleic acid containing Sphingomyelin (C18:1 SM) elutes (12.1 min) shows ions at m/z 703.6 and 725.56, corresponding to the protonated and Na adduct of 16:0 SM, respectively (Fig. 1D). The quantification of the SM content in radioactive samples derived from long term metabolic labeling from [3H]palmitate was confirmed by direct measurement of SM mass in lipid extracts from both cell types. For this, lower phase lipids from WT and ldlC cells were separated by TLC, and stained lipid bands were quantified by densitometry. The SM content in ldlC cells lipid extract was ∼65% lower than in WT cells (supplemental Fig. 1), consistent with ∼75% lower content determined from metabolic labeling experiments. Lysenin is a pore-forming toxin from the earthworm Eisenia foetida that specifically binds SM clusters in membranes (30.Yamaji A. Sekizawa Y. Emoto K. Sakuraba H. Inoue K. Kobayashi H. Umeda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5300-5306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 31.Yamaji-Hasegawa A. Makino A. Baba T. Senoh Y. Kimura-Suda H. Sato S.B. Terada N. Ohno S. Kiyokawa E. Umeda M. Kobayashi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22762-22770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). To see whether the decreased total SM content in lipid extracts of ldlC cells (Fig. 1) affects cell surface SM expression, the binding of lysenin was determined in fixed ldlC cells. By confocal microscopy, it was found that ldlC cell plasma membrane shows less lysenin aggregates than WT cells (Fig. 2A). Quantification of these aggregates indicates that although ∼70% of the WT cells show between 10 and 40 aggregates per cell, most ldlC cells show <10 aggregates (Fig. 2B), thus showing that the level of plasma membrane SM is also affected in ldlC cells. SM is synthesized in the Golgi complex by SMS1, a multipass membrane protein of the Golgi, and by SMS2, a plasma membrane protein. Both enzymes catalyze the transfer of phosphocholine moiety of PC to the acceptor ceramide to synthesize SM (24.Huitema K. van den Dikkenberg J. Brouwers J.F. Holthuis J.C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar), but SMS1 acts as a major SM synthase activity (32.Tafesse F.G. Huitema K. Hermansson M. van der Poel S. van den Dikkenberg J. Uphoff A. Somerharju P. Holthuis J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 17537-17547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Recent immunoelectron microscopy data revealed that SMS1 was mostly present at the trans side of the Golgi of HeLa cells (33.Halter D. Neumann S. van Dijk S.M. Wolthoorn J. de Mazière A.M. Vieira O.V. Mattjus P. Klumperman J. van Meer G. Sprong H. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 179: 101-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). We determined this activity in homogenates of WT and ldlC cells by measuring the conversion of the exogenous fluorescent ceramide analog C6-NBD-ceramide into fluorescent SM (Fig. 3A). Quantitative estimation of the formed product revealed that the SMS activity in ldlC cells was essentially as in WT cells (Fig. 3A). Formation of GlcCer, the product of glucosylceramide synthase activity also measured in the assay, was slightly increased in ldlC cells but the difference was not significant (Fig. 3A). The fact that in SM-defective ldlC cells the in vitro activity of SMS1 is essentially normal (Fig. 3A) suggests that in vivo, some of the two participating substrates of the SM synthesis reaction, PC, and/or ceramide, may be not available to SMS1. To test this possibility and considering that the PC level was normal in ldlC cells (Fig. 1B), they were tested for their capacity to incorporate exogenous C6-NBD-ceramide into SM when cultured in its presence. This fluorescent ceramide analog permeates the cellular membranes and accumulates in intracellular structures, concentrating particularly in the Golgi complex (34.Lipsky N."
https://openalex.org/W2117004342,"Surfactant protein A (SP-A), a C-type lectin, plays an important role in innate lung host defense against inhaled pathogens. Crystallographic SP-A·ligand complexes have not been reported to date, limiting available molecular information about SP-A interactions with microbial surface components. This study describes crystal structures of calcium-dependent complexes of the C-terminal neck and carbohydrate recognition domain of SP-A with d-mannose, D-α-methylmannose, and glycerol, which represent subdomains of glycans on pathogen surfaces. Comparison of these complexes with the unliganded SP-A neck and carbohydrate recognition domain revealed an unexpected ligand-associated conformational change in the loop region surrounding the lectin site, one not previously reported for the lectin homologs SP-D and mannan-binding lectin. The net result of the conformational change is that the SP-A lectin site and the surrounding loop region become more compact. The Glu-202 side chain of unliganded SP-A extends out into the solvent and away from the calcium ion; however, in the complexes, the Glu-202 side chain translocates 12.8 Å to bind the calcium. The availability of Glu-202, together with positional changes involving water molecules, creates a more favorable hydrogen bonding environment for carbohydrate ligands. The Lys-203 side chain reorients as well, extending outward into the solvent in the complexes, thereby opening up a small cation-friendly cavity occupied by a sodium ion. Binding of this cation brings the large loop, which forms one wall of the lectin site, and the adjacent small loop closer together. The ability to undergo conformational changes may help SP-A adapt to different ligand classes, including microbial glycolipids and surfactant lipids."
https://openalex.org/W1976776005,"Here, we report the identification of the RNA binding motif protein RBM15B/OTT3 as a new CDK11(p110) binding partner that alters the effects of CDK11 on splicing. RBM15B was initially identified as a binding partner of the Epstein-Barr virus mRNA export factor and, more recently, as a cofactor of the nuclear export receptor NXF1. In this study, we found that RBM15B co-elutes with CDK11(p110), cyclin L2α, and serine-arginine (SR) proteins, including SF2/ASF, in a large nuclear complex of ∼1-MDa molecular mass following size exclusion chromatography. Using co-immunoprecipitation experiments and in vitro pulldown assays, we mapped two distinct domains of RBM15B that are essential for its direct interaction with the N-terminal extension of CDK11(p110), cyclin L2α, and SR proteins such as 9G8 and SF2/ASF. Finally, we established that RBM15B is a functional competitor of the SR proteins SF2/ASF and 9G8, inhibits formation of the functional spliceosomal E complex, and antagonizes the positive effect of the CDK11(p110)-cyclin L2α complex on splicing both in vitro and in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2009274336,"The aim of this study was to explore the genetic relationship between the nine component traits comprising the British Veterinary Association (BVA) total hip score in UK registered Labrador Retrievers. Data consisted of 11,928 single records of trait scores of dogs aged between one and four years (365-1459 days) old, from radiographs evaluated between 2000 and 2007. Pedigree information was provided by the UK Kennel Club. The distribution of trait scores showed only small numbers of dogs with visible malformation in the six traits that were scored according to the severity of osteoarthritis. Linear mixed models were fitted using ASREML. Estimates of heritability ranged from 0.15 to 0.38, and litter effects from 0.04 to 0.10. Genetic correlations between all nine traits were extremely high ranging from 0.71 to 1.0, implying considerable genetic similarity. The decomposition demonstrated that aggregate scores of only the 3 traits indicative of laxity in one year old dogs was predictive of the phenotype of the remaining six scored on osteoarthritic severity in dogs at 4+ years old. The application of selection index methodology in selecting against hip dysplasia using the trait scores was explored and potential improvements in accuracy (directly related to response to selection) of over 10% are reported compared to the current total hip score. This study demonstrates that traits descriptive of joint laxity are valuable early-age predictors of osteoarthritis and shows that there is scope for improvement in the way data from the UK hip score scheme are used for selection against hip dysplasia in Labradors. This was verified via use of selection indices, which identified substantial increases in accuracy, not only via optimum coefficients, but also through an easily applicable aggregate of scores of just two or three traits only compared with the current total hip score."
https://openalex.org/W2093860130,"The EGF receptor is a classical receptor-tyrosine kinase. In the absence of ligand, the receptor adopts a closed conformation in which the dimerization arm of subdomain II interacts with the tethering arm in subdomain IV. Following the binding of EGF, the receptor opens to form a symmetric, back-to-back dimer. Although it is clear that the dimerization arm of subdomain II is central to the formation of receptor dimers, the role of the tethering arm of subdomain IV (residues 561–585) in this configuration is not known. Here we use <sup>125</sup>I-EGF binding studies to assess the functional role of the tethering arm in the EGF receptor dimer. Mutation of the three major residues that contribute to tethering (D563A,H566A,K585A-EGF receptor) did not significantly alter either the ligand binding properties or the signaling properties of the EGF receptor. By contrast, breaking the Cys<sup>558</sup>-Cys<sup>567</sup> disulfide bond through double alanine replacements or deleting the loop entirely led to a decrease in the negative cooperativity in EGF binding and was associated with small changes in downstream signaling. Deletion of the Cys<sup>571</sup>-Cys<sup>593</sup> disulfide bond abrogated cooperativity, resulting in a high affinity receptor and increased sensitivity of downstream signaling pathways to EGF. Releasing the Cys<sup>571</sup>-Cys<sup>593</sup> disulfide bond resulted in extreme negative cooperativity, ligand-independent kinase activity, and impaired downstream signaling. These data demonstrate that the tethering arm plays an important role in supporting cooperativity in ligand binding. Because cooperativity implies subunit-subunit interactions, these results also suggest that the tethering arm contributes to intersubunit interactions within the EGF receptor dimer."
https://openalex.org/W1999820466,"We have previously shown that β-amyloid (Aβ) treatment resulted in an age-dependent calpain activation leading to Tau cleavage into a neurotoxic 17-kDa fragment in a cellular model of Alzheimer disease. This detrimental cellular response was mediated by a developmentally regulated increase in membrane cholesterol levels. In this study, we assessed the molecular mechanisms by which cholesterol modulated Aβ-induced Tau cleavage in cultured hippocampal neurons. Our results indicated that these mechanisms did not involve the regulation of the binding of Aβ aggregates to the plasma membrane. On the other hand, experiments using N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptor inhibitors suggested that these receptors played an essential role in cholesterol-mediated Aβ-dependent calpain activity and 17-kDa Tau production. Biochemical and immunocytochemical analyses demonstrated that decreasing membrane cholesterol levels in mature neurons resulted in a significant reduction of the NR1 subunit at the membrane as well as an increase in the number of large NR1, NR2A, and NR2B subunit clusters. Moreover, the majority of these larger N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptor subunit immunoreactive spots was not juxtaposed to presynaptic sites in cholesterol-reduced neurons. These data suggested that changes at the synaptic level underlie the mechanism by which membrane cholesterol modulates developmental changes in the susceptibility of hippocampal neurons to Aβ-induced toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2058323276,"G protein-activated inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK or Kir3) channels are directly gated by the βγ subunits of G proteins and contribute to inhibitory neurotransmitter signaling pathways. Paradoxically, volatile anesthetics such as halothane inhibit these channels. We find that neuronal Kir3 currents are highly sensitive to inhibition by halothane. Given that Kir3 currents result from increased Gβγ available to the channels, we asked whether reducing available Gβγ to the channel would adversely affect halothane inhibition. Remarkably, scavenging Gβγ using the C-terminal domain of β-adrenergic receptor kinase (cβARK) resulted in channel activation by halothane. Consistent with this effect, channel mutants that impair Gβγ activation were also activated by halothane. A single residue, phenylalanine 192, occupies the putative Gβγ gate of neuronal Kir3.2 channels. Mutation of Phe-192 at the gate to other residues rendered the channel non-responsive, either activated or inhibited by halothane. These data indicated that halothane predominantly interferes with Gβγ-mediated Kir3 currents, such as those functioning during inhibitory synaptic activity. Our report identifies the molecular correlate for anesthetic inhibition of Kir3 channels and highlights the significance of these effects in modulating neurotransmitter-mediated inhibitory signaling."
