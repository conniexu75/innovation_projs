https://openalex.org/W2122739133,"Here's a subject guaranteed to cause controversy: the relationship between intelligence, measured by IQ tests, and physical brain development in children and adolescents. A study that followed 307 typically developing subjects from childhood to adolescence (roughly between the ages of 6 and 19 years) now suggests that ‘brainy’ children are not cleverer by virtue of having more or less grey matter at any one age. Rather, intelligence is related to various aspects of the continuing process of cortical maturation. Specifically, the trajectory of change in the thickness of the cerebral cortex, not cortical thickness itself, relates to intelligence. More intelligent children demonstrate a particularly plastic cortex, with an initial accelerated and prolonged phase of cortical increase, which yields to equally vigorous cortical thinning by early adolescence. Children who are adept at any one of the three academic ‘R's (reading, writing and arithmetic) tend to be good at the others, and grow into adults who are similarly skilled at diverse intellectually demanding activities1,2,3. Determining the neuroanatomical correlates of this relatively stable individual trait of general intelligence has proved difficult, particularly in the rapidly developing brains of children and adolescents. Here we demonstrate that the trajectory of change in the thickness of the cerebral cortex, rather than cortical thickness itself, is most closely related to level of intelligence. Using a longitudinal design, we find a marked developmental shift from a predominantly negative correlation between intelligence and cortical thickness in early childhood to a positive correlation in late childhood and beyond. Additionally, level of intelligence is associated with the trajectory of cortical development, primarily in frontal regions implicated in the maturation of intelligent activity4,5. More intelligent children demonstrate a particularly plastic cortex, with an initial accelerated and prolonged phase of cortical increase, which yields to equally vigorous cortical thinning by early adolescence. This study indicates that the neuroanatomical expression of intelligence in children is dynamic."

https://openalex.org/W2143526409,"Germ cells in the mouse embryo can develop as oocytes or spermatogonia, depending on molecular cues that have not been identified. We found that retinoic acid, produced by mesonephroi of both sexes, causes germ cells in the ovary to enter meiosis and inititate oogenesis. Meiosis is retarded in the fetal testis by the action of the retinoid-degrading enzyme CYP26B1, ultimately leading to spermatogenesis. In testes of Cyp26b1 -knockout mouse embryos, germ cells enter meiosis precociously, as if in a normal ovary. Thus, precise regulation of retinoid levels during fetal gonad development provides the molecular control mechanism that specifies germ cell fate."
https://openalex.org/W2142703753,"Quantifying long-range dissemination of infectious diseases is a key issue in their dynamics and control. Here, we use influenza-related mortality data to analyze the between-state progression of interpandemic influenza in the United States over the past 30 years. Outbreaks show hierarchical spatial spread evidenced by higher pairwise synchrony between more populous states. Seasons with higher influenza mortality are associated with higher disease transmission and more rapid spread than are mild ones. The regional spread of infection correlates more closely with rates of movement of people to and from their workplaces (workflows) than with geographical distance. Workflows are described in turn by a gravity model, with a rapid decay of commuting up to around 100 km and a long tail of rare longer range flow. A simple epidemiological model, based on the gravity formulation, captures the observed increase of influenza spatial synchrony with transmissibility; high transmission allows influenza to spread rapidly beyond local spatial constraints."
https://openalex.org/W2051255001,"Bone metastases are a frequent complication of many cancers that result in severe disease burden and pain. Since the late nineteenth century, it has been thought that the microenvironment of the local host tissue actively participates in the propensity of certain cancers to metastasize to specific organs, and that bone provides an especially fertile 'soil'. In the case of breast cancers, the local chemokine milieu is now emerging as an explanation for why these tumours preferentially metastasize to certain organs. However, as the inhibition of chemokine receptors in vivo only partially blocks metastatic behaviour, other factors must exist that regulate the preferential metastasis of breast cancer cells. Here we show that the cytokine RANKL (receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand) triggers migration of human epithelial cancer cells and melanoma cells that express the receptor RANK. RANK is expressed on cancer cell lines and breast cancer cells in patients. In a mouse model of melanoma metastasis, in vivo neutralization of RANKL by osteoprotegerin results in complete protection from paralysis and a marked reduction in tumour burden in bones but not in other organs. Our data show that local differentiation factors such as RANKL have an important role in cell migration and the tissue-specific metastatic behaviour of cancer cells."

Linear chains of 1 to 10 manganese atoms were assembled one atom at a time on a thin insulating layer, and the spin excitation spectra of these structures were measured with inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy. We observed excitations of the coupled atomic spins that can change both the total spin and its orientation. Comparison with a model spin-interaction Hamiltonian yielded the collective spin configuration and the strength of the coupling between the atomic spins."

https://openalex.org/W2042330843,"Proprioception, the sense of self, is essential for our daily life. For example, we count on proprioception to ‘feel’ our body position in space and guide how much to extend our arms and legs. A study of the roundworm C. elegans shows that it uses proprioception to control its body posture and position during locomotion. This requires a single proprioceptor neuron and a mechanosensitive ion channel functioning in this neuron. Interestingly, this C. elegans neuron is functionally analogous to human muscle spindles and Golgi tendon organs that are important for controlling arm and leg movements. These results suggest that the basic principles of proprioception are evolutionarily conserved between C. elegans and humans, and indicate that C. elegans can be a valuable model organism for studying proprioception and its related human diseases. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is commonly used as a genetic model organism for dissecting integration of the sensory and motor systems1. Despite extensive genetic and behavioural analyses that have led to the identification of many genes and neural circuits involved in regulating C. elegans locomotion behaviour1, it remains unclear whether and how somatosensory feedback modulates motor output during locomotion. In particular, no stretch receptors have been identified in C. elegans, raising the issue of whether stretch-receptor-mediated proprioception is used by C. elegans to regulate its locomotion behaviour. Here we have characterized TRP-4, the C. elegans homologue of the mechanosensitive TRPN channel. We show that trp-4 mutant worms bend their body abnormally, exhibiting a body posture distinct from that of wild-type worms during locomotion, suggesting that TRP-4 is involved in stretch-receptor-mediated proprioception. We show that TRP-4 acts in a single neuron, DVA, to mediate its function in proprioception, and that the activity of DVA can be stimulated by body stretch. DVA both positively and negatively modulates locomotion, providing a unique mechanism whereby a single neuron can fine-tune motor activity. Thus, DVA represents a stretch receptor neuron that regulates sensory–motor integration during C. elegans locomotion."
https://openalex.org/W2063688791,"The evolution of altruism, especially as directed to non-kin, is an enigma of evolutionary biology. Explanations would come easier, however, if altruists were readily recognized. Arguably the simplest recognition system is a conspicuous, heritable tag. A green beard would do it. A few examples of the ‘green beard effect’ have been reported in human interactions, though beards per se and greenness tend not to feature. A problem with this explanation is the improbability of one gene encoding all three functions (altruism, tag and recognition). Based on modelling, Jansen and van Baalen identify a further problem with this theory: even if green beard genes can be selectively advantageous, altruism is unstable under previous assumptions. But, they add, the evolution of cooperation using a recognition mechanism may be more likely if many beard colours coexist. Resolving the enigma of the evolution of altruism is helped along by models showing that the coexistence of many tags makes the evolution of cooperation using a recognition mechanism more likely. The evolution of altruism, a behaviour that benefits others at one's own fitness expense, poses a darwinian paradox. The paradox is resolved if many interactions are with related individuals so that the benefits of altruism are reaped by copies of the altruistic gene in other individuals1, a mechanism called kin selection2. However, recognition of altruists could provide an alternative route towards the evolution of altruism1,3,4,5. Arguably the simplest recognition system is a conspicuous, heritable tag, such as a green beard1,3. Despite the fact that such genes have been reported6,7,8, the ‘green beard effect’3 has often been dismissed because it is unlikely that a single gene can code for altruism and a recognizable tag1,3,9. Here we model the green beard effect and find that if recognition and altruism are always inherited together, the dynamics are highly unstable, leading to the loss of altruism. In contrast, if the effect is caused by loosely coupled separate genes, altruism is facilitated through beard chromodynamics in which many beard colours co-occur. This allows altruism to persist even in weakly structured populations and implies that the green beard effect, in the form of a fluid association of altruistic traits with a recognition tag, can be much more prevalent than hitherto assumed."

This response is dependent upon the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor 1 (VEGFR1), which mediates cell migration in response to VEGF or placental growth factor (PLGF). In this study, we found that exposure of cultured mouse bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) to hypoxia or an adenovirus encoding a constitutively active form of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) induced VEGFR1 mRNA and protein expression and promoted ex vivo migration in response to VEGF or PLGF. MSC in which HIF-1 activity was inhibited by a dominant negative or RNA interference approach expressed markedly reduced levels of VEGFR1 and failed to migrate or activate AKT in response to VEGF or PLGF. Thus, loss-of-function and gain-of-function approaches demonstrated that HIF-1 activity is necessary and sufficient for basal and hypoxia-induced VEGFR1 expression in bone marrow-derived MSC.

The shuttle vector pSuper-retro-GFP-Neo (OligoEngine, Seattle, WA) was used to construct retrovirus rvShRNAHIF-1α expressing a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) directed against nucleotides 1718–1736 of HIF-1α mRNA (GenBank™ accession number NM_001530). Retrovirus rvShRNASNC encodes a scrambled negative control (SNC) shRNA that targets a 19-nucleotide sequence with no identity to any mammalian gene (for shRNA targeting sequences, see Supplemental Table 1). For retroviral packaging, 293-T cells were seeded at 7 × 106 cells/10-cm dish. Retroviral vector DNA (12 μg) was cotransfected with plasmid (6 μg) encoding gag/pol/env (group antigens/polymerase/envelope protein) and plasmid (1.5 μg) encoding VSVG (vesicular stomatitis virus G protein) using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). Viral supernatant was collected 48 h post-transfection, filtered (0.45-μm pore size), and added to MSC in the presence of 8 μg/ml of polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich). The procedure was repeated at 60 and 72 h post-transfection. Hygromycin (400 μg/ml) or G418 (800 μg/ml) was added to the culture, starting at 96 h after transduction of retrovirus rvQC-GFP or rvQC-DN, rvShRNAHIF-1α, and rvShRNASNC, respectively. Pooled clones of resistant cells were cultured in the absence of hygromycin or G418 starting 24 h prior to all studies. RNA Isolation and Quantitative Real Time Reverse-transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) Analysis—Total RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis was performed as previously described (29Manalo D.J. Rowan A. Lavoie T.

Nucleotide sequences of primers used for PCR analysis of cDNA encoding GLUT1, HIF-1α, VEGF, VEGFR1, and VEGFR2 mRNA and 18 S rRNA are listed in Supplemental Table 2. Real time PCR was performed using iQ SYBR Green Supermix and iCycler Real time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad). For each set of primers, gradient PCR was performed for determination of optimal annealing temperature. Serial dilutions of cDNA samples were analyzed to determine efficiency and the dynamic range of the PCR. Stringent assay requirements were imposed as follows: (i) standard deviation for the cycle threshold (CT) among three to five replicate samples < 0.3; (ii) correlation coefficient of plot of CT versus log (ng input RNA) > 0.99; (iii) difference of < 5% in PCR efficiency (E) of samples to be compared, calculated using the formula E = (10–1/m) –1, where m is the slope of the best fit line for CT versus log (ng input RNA). The expression of each target mRNA relative to 18 S rRNA (R) under an experimental, as compared with control, condition was calculated based on the threshold cycle (CT) as r = 2–Δ(ΔCT), where ΔCT = CT target – CT 18S and Δ(ΔCT) = ΔCT experimental – ΔCT control. Immunoblot Assays—Whole cell extracts were prepared in radioimmune precipitation buffer, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose filter, and subjected to immunoblot assays. 100-μg aliquots of protein were analyzed using primary Ab at 1:1000 dilution. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary Ab against mouse or rabbit IgG was used at 1:2500 dilution, and the signal was visualized using ECL Plus reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Flow Cytometry—MSC were detached with PBS/EDTA, treated with Mouse Fc Block™ for 5 min, incubated with fluorescence-conjugated Ab for 20 min, washed with PBS, and resuspended in PBS for analysis using an LSRII fluorescence activated cell sorter (BD Bioscience). As a control, aliquots of cells were incubated with phycoerythrin- or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rat IgG2a Ab. Immunocytochemistry—The cells were cultured in an 8-well chamber slide, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at 4 °C, washed with PBS, blocked, and permeabilized with 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% goat serum, PBS for 30 min, incubated with primary Ab (1:300 dilution in PBS, 1% bovine serum albumin), and then incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (BD Bioscience) for 1 h. After washing, the slides were counterstained with 300 nm DAPI solution (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy (BX51; Olympus, Melville, NY). Migration Assay—MSC were cultured under nonhypoxic (95% air, 5% CO2; 20% O2) or hypoxic (1% O2, 5%CO2/balance N2) conditions for 24 h, and then 2 × 105 cells were plated per well in the upper chamber of a transwell containing a polycarbonate filter (12-μm pore size; Costar, Cambridge, MA). The lower chamber contained DMEM (Invitrogen) with or without VEGF or PLGF. After a 12-h incubation at 37 °C in 95% air/5% CO2, the cells in the lower chamber were counted. Statistics—The data are presented as the means and standard deviations. The differences between subclones or treatment conditions were analyzed by Student's t test, and p < 0.05 was considered significant. Characterization of MSC Derived from Bone Marrow of C57BL/6 Mice—Mononuclear cells were isolated from bone marrow of C57BL/6 mice and cultured on uncoated dishes in DMEM with 10% FBS to isolate MSC. By passage 6, a homogenous population of rapidly dividing cells with fibroblastoid morphology was obtained (data not shown). Analysis by flow cytometry at passage 8 revealed that these cells expressed Sca-1, CD44, and CD105 (Fig. 1A), as previously described for human MSC (35Pittenger M.F. Mackay A.M. Beck S.C. Jaiswal R.K. Douglas R. Mosca J.D. Moorman M.A. Simonetti D.W. Craig S. Marshak D.R. Science. 1999; 284: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (18027) Google Scholar, 36Pittenger M.F. Martin B.J. Circ. Res. 2004; 95: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). The mouse MSC did not express the myeloid/hematopoietic markers CD11b, CD34, CD45 (Fig. 1A), or c-Kit (data not shown). Immunocytochemistry revealed the expression of VEGFR1 in MSC (Fig. 1, B and C), as observed in HUVEC (Fig. 1, D and E). HUVEC also expressed high levels of VEGFR2 (Fig. 1, J and K), whereas murine MSC did not express VEGFR2 (Fig. 1, H and I), nor did they express the endothelial cell marker CD31 (data not shown). Effect of Hypoxia or Adenoviral Expression of a Constitutively Active Form of HIF-1α—Infection of nonhypoxic cells with adenovirus AdCA5, which encodes a constitutively active form of HIF-1α, has been shown to result in cell type-specific changes in gene expression that are remarkably similar to those that occur in response to hypoxia (29Manalo D.J. Rowan A. Lavoie T. Natarajan L. Kelly B.D. Ye S.Q. Garcia J.G. Semenza G.L. Blood. 2005; 105: 659-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar, 30Kelly B.D. Hackett S.F. Hirota K. Oshima Y. Cai Z. Berg-Dixon S. Rowan A. Yan Z. Campochiaro P.A. Semenza G.L. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 1074-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). When MSC were infected with AdCA5, which also encodes GFP, greater than 95% of the cells were GFP-positive as determined by fluorescence microscopy 24 h after infection (Fig. 2A). AdCA5-infected MSC constitutively expressed high levels of HIF-1α mRNA as detected by RT-PCR (Fig. 2B). In contrast, cells infected with the control adenovirus AdLacZ expressed levels of HIF-1α mRNA that were comparable with uninfected MSC. qRT-PCR analysis revealed that HIF-1α mRNA levels were 1448 ± 14-fold (mean ± S.D.) higher in AdCA5-infected MSC as compared with AdLacZ-infected MSC (data not shown). Immunoblot assays using mAb H1α67, which was raised against amino acid residues 432–528 of human HIF-1α (31Zhong H. De Marzo A.M. Laughner E. Lim M. Hilton D.A. Zagzag D. Buechler P. Isaacs W.B. Semenza G.L. Simons J.W. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5830-5835PubMed Google Scholar), detected high levels of endogenous HIF-1α protein migrating with an apparent molecular mass of 120 kDa, as previously described (19Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1230-1237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1729) Google Scholar), in extracts from hypoxic MSC and HeLa cells, whereas nonhypoxic MSC or HeLa cells expressed low levels of HIF-1α (Fig. 2C, top panel). AdCA5 encodes an altered form of human HIF-1α, which includes a deletion (amino acid residues 392–520) and missense mutations (P567T and P658Q) (30Kelly B.D. Hackett S.F. Hirota K. Oshima Y. Cai Z. Berg-Dixon S. Rowan A. Yan Z. Campochiaro P.A. Semenza G.L. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 1074-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar), that is not recognized by mAb H1α67. mAb clone 54 was raised against amino acid residues 610–727 of human HIF-1α and recognizes both human HIF-1α and CA5 but does not recognize mouse HIF-1α (Fig. 2C, middle panel). These results demonstrate that AdCA5 infection of MSC results in high levels of CA5 in MSC under nonhypoxic conditions. 91- and 94-kDa proteins corresponding to the 774- and 789-amino acid isoforms of HIF-1β were detected by immunoblot assay using mAb H1β234 (Fig. 2C, bottom panel). HIF-1β expression levels were not affected by hypoxia or adenoviral infection and provide evidence that similar amounts of total protein were analyzed in each lane. The expression of VEGF, VEGFR1, and VEGFR2 was examined in AdCA5-infected MSC. VEGF is a well established HIF-1-regulated gene (37Forsythe J.A. Jiang B.-H. Iyer N.V. Agani F. Leung S.W. Koos R.D. Semenza G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4604-4613Crossref PubMed Scopus (3217) Google Scholar) that is transactivated in response to AdCA5 infection in other cell types (29Manalo D.J. Rowan A.

Cardiovasc. Res. 2005; 68: 144-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). RT-PCR analysis revealed that both VEGF and VEGFR1 mRNA levels in MSC were increased in response to hypoxia or AdCA5 infection, whereas VEGFR2 mRNA was not detected under any of the treatment conditions (Fig. 2D, left panels). qRT-PCR analysis revealed that compared with uninfected, nonhypoxic MSC, levels of VEGF mRNA increased 6.1 ± 0.2-fold in response to hypoxia, were unchanged after AdLacZ infection, and increased 8.0 ± 0.2-fold after AdCA5 infection (Fig. 2D, right upper panel). VEGFR1 mRNA levels increased 2.4 ± 0.1-fold in response to hypoxia, 3.7 ± 0.3-fold in response to AdLacZ infection, and 7.8 ± 0.3-fold in response to AdCA5 infection (Fig. 2D, right lower panel). Thus, compared with their appropriate controls, hypoxia and AdCA5 infection increased VEGF and VEGFR1 mRNA levels in MSC to a similar degree. Immunoblot assays revealed that MSC expressed VEGFR1 but not VEGFR2 protein (Fig. 2E, left panels), results that were consistent with mRNA analyses (Fig. 2D) and immunocytochemistry (Fig. 1). By densitometric analysis, levels of VEGFR1 protein increased 1.8-fold in response to hypoxia, 1.3-fold in response to AdLacZ infection, and 3.0-fold in response to AdCA5 infection, relative to the levels of VEGFR1 protein in uninfected, nonhypoxic MSC (Fig. 2E, right panel). Thus, VEGFR1 mRNA and protein levels in MSC increased in response to hypoxia or expression of a constitutively active form of HIF-1α under nonhypoxic conditions. Inhibition of HIF-1 in MSC by Expression of a Dominant Negative Form of HIF-1α—MSC were infected with a retrovirus expressing a dominant negative form of HIF-1α (rvQC-DN), and a stably transduced subclone was selected. As a control, a subclone of MSC stably transduced with a retrovirus expressing GFP (rvQC-GFP) was also selected. After selection, 100% of MSC were stably transduced with rvQC-GFP and expressed GFP as determined by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 3A). Immunoblot assays revealed that HIF-1α protein expression was induced in hypoxic MSC transduced with rvQC-GFP, whereas levels of HIF-1α protein were reduced under nonhypoxic and hypoxic conditions in MSC transduced with rvQC-DN (Fig. 3B). HIF-1αDN competes with endogenous HIF-1α for dimerization with HIF-1β. In contrast to HIF-1α-HIF-1β heterodimers, HIF-1αDN-HIF-1β heterodimers cannot bind to DNA or activate transcription (21Jiang B.-H. Rue E. Wang G.L. Roe R. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17771-17778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). HIF-1α protein that fails to form heterodimers is degraded at an increased rate, thus accounting for the modestly reduced levels of HIF-1α in hypoxic cells expressing HIF-1αDN (39Stoeltzing O. McCarty M.F. Wey J.S. Fan F. Liu W. Belcheva A. Bucana C.D. Semenza G.L. Ellis L.M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2004; 96: 946-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). HIF-1αDN contains two deletions (amino acid residues 4–27 and 391–826) and, as a result, is not detected by either mAb H1α67 or mAb clone 54. The expression of VEGF, GLUT1, and VEGFR1 mRNA was examined in MSC transduced with rvQC-DN or rvQC-GFP. As in the case of the VEGF gene, GLUT1 is a well established HIF-1 target gene (33Iyer N.V. Kotch L.E. Agani F. Leung S.W. Laughner E. Wenger R.H. Gassmann M. Gearhart J.D. Lawler A.M. Yu A.Y. Semenza G.L. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 149-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (2051) Google Scholar, 40Wood S.M.

Chem. 1998; 273: 8360-8368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). qRT-PCR analysis revealed that VEGF, GLUT1 and VEGFR1 mRNA levels were all increased in response to hypoxia in nontransduced MSC (data not shown) and MSC transduced with rvQC-GFP, but not in MSC transduced with rvQC-DN (Fig. 3C). Compared with cells transduced with rvQC-GFP, levels of VEGFR1 mRNA expression in MSC transduced with rvQC-DN were decreased 5.0-fold under nonhypoxic conditions and 5.7-fold under hypoxic conditions (Fig. 3C). These results indicate that inhibition of HIF-1 activity by HIF-1αDN strikingly decreased VEGFR1 mRNA expression under both nonhypoxic and hypoxic conditions. To analyze the effect of HIF-1 inhibition on VEGFR1 protein levels, MSC transduced with rvQC-GFP or rvQC-DN were incubated under nonhypoxic or hypoxic conditions for 24 or 48 h. Immunoblot assays revealed that compared with MSC transduced with rvQC-GFP, VEGFR1 protein expression was strikingly reduced in MSC transduced with rvQC-DN under both nonhypoxic and hypoxic conditions (Fig. 3D). These immunoblot data are consistent with the qRT-PCR data (Fig. 3C) and indicate that reduced HIF-1 activity results in reduced VEGFR1 mRNA and protein levels. Effect of Inhibiting HIF-1α Expression by RNA Interference—A second approach to induce HIF-1 loss-of-function was also utilized. MSC were transduced with a retrovirus encoding an shRNA that targeted HIF-1α mRNA for degradation (rvShRNAHIF-1α) or a retrovirus encoding a scrambled negative control shRNA (rvShRNASNC), and subclones of stably transduced MSC were selected. HIF-1α mRNA levels in MSC transduced with rvShRNAHIF-1α were decreased by 60% relative to the levels of HIF-1α mRNA in MSC transduced with rvShRNASNC (Fig. 4A). Immunoblot assays revealed reduced HIF-1α protein levels in hypoxic MSC transduced with rvShRNAHIF-1α compared with MSC transduced with rvShRNASNC under both nonhypoxic and hypoxic conditions (Fig. 4B). VEGFR1 mRNA levels were decreased under both nonhypoxic and hypoxic conditions in MSC transduced with rvShRNAHIF-1α compared with MSC transduced with rvShRNASNC (Fig. 4C). VEGFR1 protein expression was also strikingly reduced in both hypoxic a"
https://openalex.org/W2141963288,"Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) has been shown to improve cardiac function after myocardial infarction (MI) by bone marrow cell mobilization and by protecting cardiomyocytes from apoptotic cell death. However, its role in collateral artery growth (arteriogenesis) has not been elucidated. Here, we investigated the effect of G-CSF on arteriolar growth and cardiac function in a murine MI model. Mice were treated with G-CSF (100 microg/kg/day) directly after MI for 5 consecutive days. G-CSF application resulted in a significant increase of circulating mononuclear cells expressing stem cell markers. Arterioles in the border zone of infarcted myocardium showed an increased expression of ICAM-1 accompanied by an accumulation of bone marrow derived cells and a pronounced proliferation of endothelial and smooth muscle cells. Histology of G-CSF treated mice revealed a lower amount of granulation tissue (67.8 vs. 84.4%) associated with a subsequent reduction in free LV wall thinning and scar extension (23.1 vs. 30.8% of LV). Furthermore, G-CSF treated animals showed a significant improvement of post-MI survival (68.8 vs. 46.2%). Pressure-volume relations revealed a partially restored myocardial function at day 30 (EF: 32.5 vs. 17.2%). Our results demonstrate that G-CSF administration after MI stimulates arteriogenesis and attenuates ischemic cardiomyopathy after MI."

Microcins are a class of small (<10 kDa) ribosomally synthesized peptide antibiotics produced by Enterobacteriaceae (1Moreno F. Gonzalez-Pastor J.E. Baquero M.R. Bravo D. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 521-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Whereas some microcins are active as unmodified peptides (2Pons A.-M. Lanneluc I. Cottenceau G. Sable S. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), others are produced as polypeptide precursors that are heavily modified by dedicated maturation enzymes (3Destoumieux-Garzon D. Peduzzi J. Rebuffat S. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 511-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Interest is attached to such post-translationally modified microcins due to their highly unusual structures and the fact that they target important cellular processes that are attractive targets for antibacterial drug development. Genes responsible for microcin production are usually plasmidborne. Plasmids encoding microcin structural and maturation genes also encode determinants of immunity specific to the microcin produced. Based on cross-immunity, post-translationally modified microcins can be subdivided into the B, C, and J types.

The structure of the subject of this study, Microcin C (McC) is shown in Fig. 1A. McC is a heptapeptide containing a modified adenosine monophosphate covalently attached to its C terminus through an N-acylphosphoramidate linkage (11Metlitskaya A.Z. Katrukha G.S. Shashkov A.S.

The phosphoramidate group of the nucleotide part of McC is additionally modified by a propylamine group. Additionally, in mature McC, the peptide moiety, which is encoded by the mccA gene, is modified and the C-terminal asparagine residue specified by mccA is converted to an aspartate (18Gonzalez-Pastor J.E.

They therefore concluded that the peptide part of McC is responsible for translation inhibition, whereas the nucleotide part is involved in McC transport into the cell. Here, we define the molecular mechanism of McC action. Contrary to the suggestion of Guijarro et al. (12Guijarro J.I. Gonzalez-Pastor J.E. Baleux F. San Millan J.L. Castilla M.A. Rico M. Moreno F. Delepierre M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23520-23532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), we find that the peptide moiety of McC allows cell entry, whereas the nucleotide part is critical for translation inhibition. We show that inside the cell, McC is specifically degraded and that the product of degradation, a modified aspartyl-adenylate, strongly inhibits translation by preventing the synthesis of aminoacylated tRNAAsp by aspartyl-tRNA synthetase. Preparation of McC—The Escherichia coli strain TG1 harboring McC-producing plasmid pBM43 was grown for 18 h at 37 °C in M63 minimum medium (13Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. 1972; (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY)Google Scholar) containing 0.2% glucose and 1 mg/liter of thiamine. Cells were removed by centrifugation and the cultured medium was loaded onto Sep-Pak C8 cartridge (Waters). The cartridge was washed with water followed by a 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid wash, and bound material was eluted stepwise with 5, 10, and 20% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The 10% acetonitrile fraction was concentrated by lyophilization, dissolved in water, and subjected to reverse phase-HPLC (1 ml/min) on a ReproSil-Pur 300 ODS-3 column (5 μm, 250 × 4 mm) using a 0–20% linear gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The total gradient volume was 50 ml. Pure McC eluted as a single peak; it was lyophilized, dissolved in water, and stored at –20 °C. The yield of chromatographically and mass spectrometrically pure McC ranged from 5 to 10 mg/liter of cultured medium. Preparation of Cell Extract for McC Processing—McC-sensitive E. coli B cells were grown at 37 °C to A600 0.5 in 1 liter of M63 medium supplemented with 0.2% glucose and 0.1% yeast extract. Cells were collected by centrifugation, washed with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, resuspended in 3 ml of the same buffer, and disrupted by sonication on the Branson Ultrasonics sonifier with a microtip (5 × 10 s pulses, at maximal power setting). The lysate was centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant (total protein concentration of 20 mg/ml) was divided into aliquots and stored at –70 °C until further use. McC Processing—250 μg of McC was dissolved in 150 μl of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm MgCl2 and combined with 50 μl of cell extract prepared as described above. The reaction was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with continuous shaking. The reaction was terminated by the addition of an equal volume of 100% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. After a 30-min incubation at 4 °C, proteins were removed by centrifugation and the pellet was extracted three times with 200 μl of water. The extracts were pooled, lyophilized, redissolved in water, and fractionated on a ReproSil-Pur 300 ODS-3 column (5 μm, 250 × 4 mm). The column was first developed (0.5 ml/min) isocratically with 10 mm (NH4)2HPO4, pH 7.6, followed by a linear (0–60%) gradient of acetonitrile in the same buffer. UV-absorbing fractions were collected, lyophilized, dissolved in water, and tested in an in vitro translation system and by mass spectrometry. Active, processed McC eluted at 11.4 min during the isocratic part of chromatography. Intact McC eluted at 27.2 min by 50% acetonitrile. Processed McC prepared in this way was chromatographically and mass spectrometrically pure. The material was lyophilized and dissolved in water. The concentration was determined using UV absorption at 260 nm (calculated extinction coefficient of processed McC 16,500 μg/mol).

The reaction mixture contained [14C]Phe. The compound, which limits the reaction, was the poly(U) RNA. Preparation of S100 Cell Extract from E. coli—E. coli MRE600 cells were grown to A600 0.8 in LB medium. Cells were collected by centrifugation, and washed with 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mm Mg(OAc)2, 50 mm KOAc, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT. The cell pellet was resuspended in an equal volume of the same buffer and disrupted by a French press (pressure 1000 bar). The lysate was next centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 2.5 h. The supernatant was loaded on the column with DE-52 cellulose, equilibrated by 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mm Mg(OAc)2, 50 mm KOAc, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT. The column was washed by the same buffer. The enzyme fraction was eluted by 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mm Mg(OAc)2, 250 mm KOAc, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT (total protein concentration was ∼10 mg/ml). Francisella tularensis AspRS—The AspRS gene (aspS) was amplified by PCR, with an encoded C-terminal His6 epitope, using genomic F. tularensis strain LVS DNA as template, the primers used were 5′-CATATGAGAACACATTATAGTTCA-3′ and 5′-GGATCCTAATGGTGATGGTGATGGTGCGCGCCCCTTTCTTCTTTCTTAACA-3′ and Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene). The PCR product was cloned into PCR-Blunt II-TOPO vector (Invitrogen), the sequence of the construct was confirmed, and the corresponding NdeI-BamHI-digested fragment ligated into NdeI-BamHI-digested pET11a. Production of His6-tagged AspRS was done by transforming BL21(DE3) with pET11a-FTAspRS and growing the resulting strain using the Overnight Express™ Autoinduction System 1 (Novagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell-free extract was prepared by re-suspending E. coli cells in lysis buffer (30 mm Tris, pH 8, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol) and passage through a French pressure cell followed by centrifugation at 75,000 × g, at 4 °C for 45 min. The resulting supernatant was applied to a column containing BD TALON affinity resin (BD Bioscience), washed extensively with the lysis buffer, and AspRS-His6 subsequently eluted using the lysis buffer supplemented with 300 mm imidazole. Fractions containing AspRS-His6 (judged by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining after SDS-PAGE to be >95% pure) were pooled, dialyzed extensively against storage buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 50% glycerol), and stored at –20 °C. The concentration of AspRS-His6 was determined by active site titration as previously described (17Wilkinson A.J. Fersht A.R. Blow D.M. Winter G. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 3581-3586Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), and the reactions were performed in duplicate for 5 and 10 min. tRNA Aminoacylation Reaction—Aminoacylation reaction in E. coli S100 extract (final total protein concentration 0.1 mg/ml) was carried out at 30 °C in the presence of 30 mm Hepes KOH, pH 7.6, 1 mm DTT, 5 g/liter bulk of E. coli tRNA, 0.1 mm EDTA, 3 mm ATP, 8 mm Mg(OAc)2, 30 mm KOAc, and 40 μm of the specified amino acid. The reaction products were either precipitated in cold 5% trichloroacetic acid and subjected to scintillation counting or purified by phenol-chloroform treatment/ethanol precipitation and added to in vitro transcription-translation reactions. At the conditions used, the aminoacylation reactions were limited by tRNA, because increase of this component only resulted in a proportional increase in trichloroacetic acid-insoluble radioactivity. Aminoacylation by purified F. tularensis AspRS was conducted at identical conditions with 40 nm active F. tularensis AspRS used instead of the S100 extract. The aminoacylation reaction in 1% wheat germ S30 extract was carried out at 30 °C in the presence of 30 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 1 mm DTT, 5 g/liter of bulk yeast tRNA, 0.1 mm EDTA, 3 mm ATP, 8 mm Mg(OAc)2, 30 mm KOAc, and 40 μm of amino acid of choice. The reaction products were precipitated in cold 5% trichloroacetic acid and subjected to scintillation counting. ATP-PPi Exchange Reaction—The reaction was carried out at 37 °C in 100 mm Na-Hepes, pH 7.2, 30 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm NaF, 2 mm ATP, 2 mm [32P]PPi (∼1 cpm/pmol), 2 mm Asp, and 30 nm F. tularensis AspRS. After 1–10 min, 25 μl of the reaction were removed and added to 975 μl of solution containing 1% charcoal (NoritA), 5.6% perchloric acid, and 75 mm PPi. The radiolabeled ATP bound to the charcoal was filtered through a 3MM Whatman filter disc under vacuum, washed 3 times with 5 ml of water and once with 5 ml of ethanol. The filters were dried and the radioactivity was counted by liquid scintillation counting (Ultima Gold, Packard Corp.). McC Has No Effect on in Vitro Translation—It has previously been reported that the addition of 10 μm intact McC led to ∼50% inhibition of a coupled E. coli in vitro transcription-translation system over 30 min (12Guijarro J.I. Gonzalez-Pastor J.E. Baleux F. San Millan J.L. Castilla M.A. Rico M. Moreno F. Delepierre M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23520-23532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). However, we failed to observe any effect of the addition of 10 μm highly pure, biologically active McC to the luciferase gene in vitro transcription-translation system after as much as a 60-min incubation (Fig. 1B). It has also been reported that the peptide MRTGNAD, corresponding to the peptide moiety of mature McC inhibits in vitro translation as efficiently as intact McC (12Guijarro J.I. Gonzalez-Pastor J.E.

We synthesized the MRTGNAD peptide as well as the MRTG-NAN peptide encoded by mccA, the structural gene for McC (18Gonzalez-Pastor J.E. San Millan J.L. Castilla M.A. Moreno F. J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 23520-23532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) that such peptides have no effect on the growth of McC-sensitive cells (data not shown). The addition of these McC peptides (10 μm) had no significant effect on the coupled in vitro transcription-translation system (Fig. 1B). Incubation with Crude Cell Extract Inactivates Antibiotic Activity of McC but Makes It a Potent Inhibitor of Translation in Vitro—We hypothesized that the inability of pure McC to inhibit transcription-translation in vitro is due to a lack of processing that is required to convert it into active inhibitor. To test this hypothesis, McC was incubated with cell extract prepared from McC-sensitive E. coli cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The incubation resulted in inactivation of McC as judged by a dramatic decrease in its ability to produce growth inhibition zones on lawns of sensitive E. coli cells (data not shown). However, McC that was incubated with the cell extract (“processed McC”) strongly inhibited the coupled transcription-translation system (Fig. 1C), as well as the luciferase mRNA translation system (Fig. 1D). The addition of cell extract alone had no effect. Whereas the observation above is consistent with an idea that McC is converted into an active form upon incubation with cell extract, a question arises why this conversion does not happen in the in vitro transcription-translation reaction that contains the S30 extract of McC-sensitive MRE600 E. coli cells. The answer to this question appears to be that efficient processing of intact McC requires a high concentration of cell extract (or long incubation times) that exceed the cell extract concentration or incubation times used for in vitro transcription-translation experiments. In agreement with this idea, incubation of intact McC with the in vitro transcription-translation system for 70 min, the maximal time of in vitro transcription-translation in our experiments did not result in inactivation of McC as judged by its ability to inhibit the growth of sensitive cells (data not shown, recall that processed McC has no effect on cell growth, above). Thus, we conclude that intact McC is either processed in the cell extract or coupled with a factor(s) that converts it into an active, inhibitory form. Active Form of McC Inhibits Aspartyl-tRNA Synthetase—What is the mechanism of translation inhibition by processed McC? A clue to this question is provided by the fact that no inhibition of poly(U)-primed translation is observed with either intact or processed McC (Fig. 2). Thus, it appears that the function of translation elongation factors and the elongation properties of the ribosome are not affected by processed McC. Therefore, the likely targets could be the process of translation initiation or the function of tRNAs other than tRNAPhe. We tested the latter possibility by determining whether processed McC can inhibit the tRNA aminoacylation reaction. The results are presented in Fig. 3A. As can be seen, intact McC had no effect on tRNA aminoacylation by any of the 6 amino acids tested. In contrast, processed McC specifically inhibited tRNA aminoacylation by aspartate and, to a much lesser extent, of asparagine, but had no effect on tRNA aminoacylation by other amino acids tested. The results presented above suggest that the inhibition of aspartyl-tRNA synthetase (AspRS) may be responsible for the observed inhibition of in vitro translation by processed McC.FIGURE 3Processed McC inhibits aspartyl-tRNA synthetase. A, the indicated amino acids were used in in vitro tRNA aminoacylation reactions in the presence of 10 μm intact McC or the corresponding amount of processed McC. For each amino acid tested, aminoacylation observed in the presence of intact McC was identical to aminoacylation when water was added to the reaction instead of McC (data not shown). The bars show the mean values obtained in three independent experiments.

The results are presented in Fig. 3B. As can be seen, the addition of aminoacylated tRNAAsp but not tRNAPhe stimulated luciferase production. Thus, processed McC inhibits translation in vitro because it specifically inhibits the production of aminoacylated tRNAAsp. The final level of luciferase activity achieved after the addition of aminoacylated tRNAAsp was much lower and the time during which the increase in the activity occurred was much shorter than seen in the absence of processed McC, suggesting that the exogenously added aminoacylated tRNAAsp was quickly used up and no regeneration of aminoacylated tRNAAsp occurred in the presence of processed McC. Indeed, the second addition of aminoacylated tRNAAsp led to a further increase in luminescence. The second addition of aminoacylated tRNAAsp led to a rapid increase in luciferase production, whereas a ∼10-min lag was observed between the first addition of aminoacylated tRNAAsp and the appearance of luciferase activity (a similar lag is observed in the absence of McC, Fig. 1, B and C). This behavior is expected, because for luciferase activity to appear, transcription of the luciferase gene must occur, translation of luciferase mRNA must be initiated, and the synthesis of the entire luciferase polypeptide must be completed. These processes take time and thus contribute to the observed lag in the appearance of luciferase activity. When the first pool of exogenously added aminoacylated tRNAAsp is exhausted, translation elongation is stopped and ribosomes become stalled at Asp codons at various points of the luciferase mRNA. The second addition of aminoacylated tRNAAsp to these “primed” ribosomes releases the translation block and leads to rapid increase in luciferase production. To demonstrate that processed McC directly inhibits the function of AspRS in a pure system, we used a recombinant AspRS from F. tularensis that shares 58% amino acid identity to its E. coli homolog. We reasoned that because bacterial AspRSs are highly conserved, and intact McC is effective against a wide range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (11Metlitskaya A.Z. Katrukha G.S. Shashkov A.S. Zaitsev D.A. Egorov T.A. Khmel I.A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 357: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), processed McC would be likely to inhibit the F. tularensis enzyme. This expectation was fulfilled. As can be seen from Fig. 3C, when processed McC was present in the reaction at concentrations below 20 nm, it had little effect on tRNAAsp aminoacylation by F. tularensis AspRS. Higher concentrations of processed McC effectively inhibited tRNAAsp aminoacylation and no activity was detected above 100 nm processed McC. Because the concentration of active F. tularensis AspRS in the reaction was estimated at 40 nm, the result suggests that a stable stoichiometric complex between the inhibitor and the enzyme is readily formed. To determine the effect of processed McC on aspartyl-adenylate synthesis, Asp-dependent [32P]PPi-ATP exchange reaction catalyzed by F. tularensis AspRS was monitored in the presence of processed or intact McC. The results, presented in Fig. 3D, clearly indicate that processed McC inhibits the pyrophosphate exchange, whereas intact McC has no effect on the reaction. Thus, the inhibition of AspRS by processed McC occurs at the first step of the aminoacylation reaction, namely amino acid activation (Fig. 3D). AspRS Is the in Vivo Target of McC—The results presented so far demonstrate that processed McC inhibits translation in vitro by targeting AspRS. We hypothesized that translation inhibition by McC in vivo occurs for the same reason and that therefore AspRS is the physiological target of McC. If this were the case, cells overexpressing AspRS might become partially or completely resistant to McC. To test this prediction, E. coli BL21(DE3) cells were transformed with a pET vector-based plasmid overexpressing AspRS from D. radiodurans (20Curnow A.W. Tumbula D.L. Pelaschier J.T. Min B. Söll D.

However, despite intensive research, an effective treatment for this disease remains elusive. In this study we show that treatment of postsymptomatic, 90-day-old SOD1G93A mice with a synthetic cannabinoid, WIN55,212-2, significantly delays disease progression. Furthermore, genetic ablation of the Faah enzyme, which results in raised levels of the endocannabinoid anandamide, prevented the appearance of disease signs in 90-day-old SOD1G93A mice. Surprisingly, elevation of cannabinoid levels with either WIN55,212-2 or Faah ablation had no effect on life span. Ablation of the CB1 receptor, in contrast, had no effect on disease onset in SOD1(G93A) mice but significantly extended life span. Together these results show that cannabinoids have significant neuroprotective effects in this model of ALS and suggest that these beneficial effects may be mediated by non-CB1 receptor mechanisms."

The mechanisms that regulate S2 expression and distribution during tumorigenesis and angiogenesis have not been described, but S1 and S4 can be shed from the cell surface, resulting in soluble ectodomains (2Fitzgerald M.L.

Soluble S1 is present in the extracellular matrix of myeloma biopsies and in patient serum (19Bayer-Garner I.B. Sanderson R.D. Dhodapkar M.V. Owens R.B. Wilson C.S. Mod.

Cell. Biol. 2000; 148: 811-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Injury also stimulates the shedding of syndecans (3Elenius V. Gotte M. Reizes O. Elenius K. Bernfield M. J. Biol.

Neurooncol. 2000; 50: 121-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 23Hajjar K.A. Deora A. Curr. Atheroscler. Rep. 2000; 2: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Gliomas are high grade brain neoplasms characterized by cell proliferation, necrosis, and extensive angiogenesis (24Yao Y. Kubota T. Sato K. Kitai R. Takeuchi H. Arishima H. Acta Neurochir. (Wien.). 2001; 143: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The role of S2 in these tumors has not been investigated. In this study, the expression and localization of S2 was determined in mouse gliomas and its function in microvessel formation was investigated. We propose that S2 shedding that is regulated by pro-angiogenic growth factors and enzymes results in a soluble ectodomain that promotes angiogenic processes. Materials—Purified bovine fibronectin (Sigma), growth factor reduced Matrigel (BD Biosciences), rabbit polyclonal anti-S2 (R1891), and rat rec-S2ED have been described previously (25Chen L. Couchman J.R. Smith J. Woods A. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 481-490Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse MAB3538 anti-lamin A and C antibody (Chemicon, Temecula, CA), rabbit polyclonal anti-S1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor-488 and goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor-594 (Invitrogen), mouse anti-GAPDH (Chemicon), anti-mouse CD31 antibody (Pharmingen), Texas Red-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), active human MMP-2 and MMP-9 (Calbiochem), and human recombinant EGF, bFGF, and VEGF (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) were also used. Immunohistochemistry—Mouse glioma cells, GL261, obtained from the National Tumor Repository at the National Institutes of Health were harvested and injected (1 × 105) into the mouse brain, as described previously (26Wang D. Grammer J.R. Cobbs C.S. Stewart J E. Jr, Liu Z. Rhoden R. Hecker T.P. Ding Q. Gladson C.L. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4221-4230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After 10 days, animals were euthanized, the brains harvested, fixed in buffered formalin, and paraffin-embedded. Tissue sections (5 μm) were cut, de-paraffinized, rehydrated, permeabilized with 0.1% pepsin and 0.05% saponin, and endogenous peroxidases were blocked with 1% H2O2. Sections were incubated with anti-S2 (R1891; 1:750), 5 μg/ml of anti-mouse CD31 IgG, or nonspecific rabbit serum. Staining was performed per the manufacturer's (Biogenex, San Ramon, CA) instructions using biotinylated secondary antibody, streptavidin conjugated to HRP, and 3,3′-diaminobenzidine substrate. The tissue was counterstained with hematoxylin. Cell Culture—Immortalized MvEC were a kind gift from Drs. Candece L. Gladson and Tika Benveniste (University of Alabama at Birmingham) and were isolated from temperature-sensitive SV40 large T antigen transgenic mice (27Kanda S. Landgren E. Ljungstrom M. Claesson-Welsh L. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 383-395PubMed Google Scholar). They were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium with 10% FBS, penicillin/streptomycin, and amphotericin-B on 1% gelatin-coated tissue culture plates in a humidified chamber (33 °C, 5% CO2). FACS Analysis—MvEC were trypsinized and centrifuged (1300 rpm, 3 min, 4 °C), and 300,000 cells were resuspended in Ham's F-12 with 1% BSA and treated with primary antibody (45 min, 4 °C). Cells were centrifuged, washed, and treated with secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor-488 or Alexa Fluor-594 (Invitrogen) for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were centrifuged, washed, resuspended in PBS, and analyzed at the University of Alabama at Birmingham Flow Cytometry Core Facility. siRNA Experiments—Duplex siRNA directed toward S2 (accession number: NM_008304) was purchased (Dharmacon, Boulder, CO); the sense sequence was GAACAGAGCUGACAUCCGAUU, and the antisense sequence was UCGGAUGUCAGCUCUGUUCUU. Lamin A/C was used as a positive control for siRNA transfection and gene down-regulation. MvEC were plated (300,000 cells/well) in Ham's F-12 with 10% FBS in 6-well plates overnight, followed by incubation with siRNAs complexed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) per the manufacturer's instructions for 48 h. Culture medium was removed, cells were lysed (30 min, 4 °C) in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 1% deoxycholate, 0.2% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, protease inhibitors), and the lysate was centrifuged and subjected to dot blotting. Dot Blotting—Conditioned media or whole cell lysates were dotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane in a Bio-Rad apparatus and washed once with PBS. The membrane was then blocked in 0–1% Tween in Tris-buffered saline (TBS: 50 mm Tris-HCP, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) with 5% milk, washed, incubated with primary antibody for 1 h, washed, incubated with secondary antibody conjugated to HRP (Dako, Carpinteria, CA) for 1 h, and developed for chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences, Bucks, UK). Migration Assays—Transwell 8-μm pore filters (Costar, Corning, NY) were coated on the upper surface with 10 μg/ml fibronectin for 1 h (37 °C, 10% CO2), then washed with sterile PBS. Cells were trypsinized, centrifuged, resuspended in assay buffer (Ham's F-12 + 1% BSA, penicillin/streptomycin, and amphotericin-B), and plated (15,000 cells/well) in the upper well. MvEC were allowed to migrate toward Ham's F-12 with 5% FBS for 5 h (33 °C, 5% CO2), cells on the top of the filter were removed with a cotton swab, and migrated cells on the underside were fixed with 4% buffered paraformaldehyde, stained with crystal violet, and counted. Capillary Tube Formation Assays—MvEC were trypsinized, resuspended in Ham's F-12 with 0.25% BSA, penicillin/streptomycin, and amphotericin-B and were plated (15,000/well) on the top of growth factor-reduced Matrigel for 6 or 24 h. Capillary tube-like structures were photographed with a Nikon Diaphot microscope at the University of Alabama at Birmingham Imaging Core Facility. Capillary tube length was measured as arbitrary units. Syndecan-2 Shedding Assays—MvEC were trypsinized, centrifuged, resuspended in culture medium, and plated (15,000 cells/well) in 96-well plates overnight, washed, and incubated for 24 h in Ham's F-12 with 5% FBS ± treatment agents. Media were removed, protease inhibitors were added, and samples were dot blotted. Cell Morphology Assays—Sterile glass coverslips were coated with 10 μg/ml fibronectin for 1 h (37 °C, 10% CO2), rinsed with PBS, and blocked with 1% BSA for 30 min (37 °C, 10% CO2). Cells were trypsinized, centrifuged, resuspended in migration assay buffer, and plated (30,000 cells/coverslip) ± S2ED for 6 h. Cells were fixed with 3% glutaraldehyde (Sigma), washed three times with serum-free Ham's F-12, and mounted with PBS. Random fields were photographed using phase contrast microscopy. Immunofluorescence—Sterile glass coverslips were coated with a 1:4 dilution of growth factor-reduced Matrigel for 1 h, rinsed with PBS, and blocked with 1% BSA for 30 min (37 °C, 10% CO2). MvEC were trypsinized, centrifuged, resuspended in assay buffer, and plated (30,000 cells/coverslip) ± S2ED or S4ED for 3 h. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, washed with PBS, permeabilized with 0.15% Triton-X-100, and incubated with phalloidin conjugated to Texas Red. Coverslips were washed and mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Random fields were photographed. Statistics—A two-sample t test was used for data analysis. p < 0.05 was required for statistical significance. Syndecan-2 Is Expressed in the Microvasculature of Mouse Glioma Tumors—Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that S2 was highly expressed in gliomas propagated in mouse brain, in the vasculature of both the tumor (Fig. 1A, arrows) and normal brain tissue (Fig. 1A, arrowheads) but was generally not expressed in the normal brain parenchyma (Fig. 1A). Syndecan-2 staining was also associated with the tumor cells (Fig. 1A, T). Its localization to microvessels was confirmed by immunostaining for the endothelial cell marker, CD31 (Fig. 1B). siRNA Down-regulation of S2 Inhibits Angiogenic Processes in Vitro—Flow cytometry indicated that both S2 and S4 were expressed on the surface of MvEC, but S1 was not detected. Syndecan-2 siRNA down-regulated S2 protein in MvEC by approximately 70% as assessed by dot blotting of cell lysate and subsequent densitometric analysis using GAPDH as a control for protein loading (data not shown). Lamins A and C were similarly reduced by siRNA and used as a positive control for gene down-regulation (data not shown). No decrease in cell viability was seen with trypan blue staining of siRNA-transfected cells (data not shown). MvEC transfected with siS2 exhibited a 60% decrease in cell migration on fibronectin compared with cells transfected with control siLamin A/C (Fig. 1C, p ≤ 0.05). siS2-transfected MvEC also showed a 3-fold decrease in capillary tube formation on growth factor reduced Matrigel, as assessed by tube length, compared with siLamin A/C-transfected MvEC (Fig. 1D, p ≤ 0.05). Pro-angiogenic Molecules Stimulate the Shedding of S2 Ectodomain from MvEC Cells—EGF can accelerate the shedding of S1 and S4 from the surface of SVEC4-10 venous endothelial cells (21Subramanian S.V. Fitzgerald M.L. Bernfield M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14713-14720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). We, therefore, investigated whether EGF and other pro-angiogenic growth factors that are up-regulated in gliomas could stimulate S2 shedding from brain MvEC. When MvEC were incubated in reduced serum-containing media for 24 h, minimal levels of shed S2 and S4 ectodomains were detected in the conditioned medium (Fig. 2A). However, 20 ng/ml purified EGF, bFGF, or VEGF induced S2 shedding (Fig. 2A). EGF and bFGF treatment increased S2 shedding by approximately 8-fold and VEGF induced a 4-fold increase (Fig. 2, A and B, p ≤ 0.05). Addition of EGF did not significantly increase S4 shedding, although bFGF and VEGF both increased this by 3-fold (Fig. 2, A and B, p ≤ 0.05). Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMPs) may regulate growth factor-mediated shedding of syndecans, as broad spectrum MMP inhibitors and tissue inhibitor of MMP-3 (TIMP-3) can abrogate EGF-mediated shedding from epithelial cells (2Fitzgerald M.L. Wang Z. Park P.W. Murphy G. Bernfield M. J. Cell. Biol. 2000; 148: 811-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Similarly, stimulants of MMP production, such as phorbol esters, enhance S1 and S4 shedding, and this can be inhibited by MMP inhibitors and TIMP-3 (2Fitzgerald M.L. Wang Z. Park P.W. Murphy G. Bernfield M. J. Cell. Biol. 2000; 148: 811-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 21Subramanian S.V. Fitzgerald M.L. Bernfield M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14713-14720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Since MMP-2 and MMP-9 are up-regulated in the microvasculature of human glioma biopsies and can promote angiogenesis (28Thorns V. Walter G.F. Thorns C. Anticancer Res. 2003; 23: 3937-3944PubMed Google Scholar, 29Wang M. Wang T. Liu S. Yoshida D. Teramoto A. Brain Tumor Pathol. 2003; 20: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), we tested whether purified active MMP-2 and MMP-9 induced syndecan shedding (Fig. 2, A and B). 20 ng/ml MMP-2 and MMP-9 increased S2 shedding by more than 11- and 9-fold, respectively, and both increased S4 shedding by 3-fold (Fig. 2, A and B, p ≤ 0.05). No S1 shedding could be detected in response to growth factors or MMPs, consistent with the negative FACS analysis for S1 (data not shown). Recombinant S2ED Promotes Angiogenic Processes in Vitro—Since pro-angiogenic factors increased S2 and S4 ectodomain shedding, we investigated whether exogenously added S2 and S4 ectodomains affected angiogenic processes in vitro. Although many interactions of proteoglycans are via their glycosaminoglycan chains (1Couchman J.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 926-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), recent evidence suggests that the ectodomain of the core protein may have a direct role(s) (1Couchman J.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 926-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 10Park H. Kim Y. Lim Y. Han I. Oh E.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 15715-15718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). When a bacterial recombinant S2ED, which lacks glycanation, was incorporated into in vitro assays, there was a dose-dependent increase in MvEC migration on fibronectin, with 100 nm resulting in a more than 3-fold increase (Fig. 3A, p ≤ 0.05). Addition of S4ED resulted in a different biphasic pattern of migration with increasing concentration (Fig. 3A). S2ED at 100 nm also promoted the formation of capillary tube-like structures on fibronectin, while no change was observed with S4ED (data not shown). To investigate further the ability of S2ED to promote angiogenic processes, MvEC were plated ± S2ED onto growth factor-reduced Matrigel. Incubation of MvEC with 100 nm S2ED increased capillary tube formation, with a 1.5-fold increase in length at both 6 and 24 h when tube length was compared with control (Fig. 3, B and C, p ≤ 0.05). There was also an apparent reduction in tube branching, as indicated by increased cell number at the branch points. (Fig. 3C). S4ED had no effect on capillary tube formation at either time point (data not shown). MvEC were also allowed to attach and spread on coverslips coated with diluted growth factor-reduced Matrigel + 100 nm S2ED. Staining with phalloidin indicated that 100 nm S2ED increased cell-cell interactions with cells appearing as groups (Fig. 3E, arrows), whereas control cells were mostly present as single cells (Fig. 3D). MvEC plated in the presence of S4ED resembled control cells (data not shown). Syndecans have been investigated in some other types of cancers and in cancer cells (8Davies E.J. Blackhall F.H. Shanks J.H. David G. McGown A.T. Swindell R. Slade R.J. Martin-Hirsch P. Gallagher J.T. Jayson G.C. Clin. Cancer Res. 2004; 10: 5178-5186Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 10Park H. Kim Y.

Histol. 2004; 35: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), but this is the first report to indicate a role for S2 in glioma angiogenesis, particularly a role for the shed ectodomain. Syndecan-2 is highly expressed in the microvasculature of mouse glioma tumors, and down-regulation in MvEC cells inhibits cell migration and capillary tube formation in vitro, processes necessary for angiogenesis. Furthermore, pro-angiogenic growth factors and enzymes that are increased in glioma tumors (e.g. EGF, bFGF, VEGF, MMP-2, and MMP-9) (22Dunn I.F. Heese O. Black P.M. J. Neurooncol. 2000; 50: 121-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 24Yao Y. Kubota T. Sato K. Kitai R. Takeuchi H. Arishima H. Acta Neurochir.

Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 7393-7398PubMed Google Scholar) can stimulate the shedding of S2 ectodomain from endothelial cells. This may promote angiogenesis, since recombinant soluble S2ED increased brain microvascular endothelial cell motility, capillary tube formation, and cell-cell interactions in vitro. Syndecan-1 and -4 are constitutively shed from the surface of mouse epithelial and SVEC4-10 cells in vitro, and factors released during stress, injury, and cancer may up-regulate this process (2Fitzgerald M.L. Wang Z. Park P.W. Murphy G. Bernfield M. J. Cell. Biol. 2000; 148: 811-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 3Elenius V. Gotte M. Reizes O. Elenius K. Bernfield M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 14713-14720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Syndecan-2 shedding has not been investigated. Epidermal growth factor, which is increased in some gliomas (22Dunn I.F. Heese O. Black P.M. J. Neurooncol. 2000; 50: 121-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), can accelerate S1 and S4 shedding (21Subramanian S.V. Fitzgerald M.L. Bernfield M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14713-14720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Basic fibroblast growth factor and VEGF can also be up-regulated in gliomas (24Yao Y. Kubota T. Sato K. Kitai R. Takeuchi H. Arishima H. Acta Neurochir. (Wien.). 2001; 143: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 30Zagzag D. Miller D.C. Sato Y. Rifkin D.B. Burstein D.E. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 7393-7398PubMed Google Scholar). These three growth factors stimulated S2 shedding from MvEC cells with much less effect on S4. Neither bFGF nor VEGF accelerated S1 or S4 shedding from SVEC4-10 cells (21Subramanian S.V. Fitzgerald M.L. Bernfield M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14713-14720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), suggesting that syndecan shedding in response to growth factors may differ with cell type or each syndecan family member. Addition of exogenous active MMP-2 and MMP-9, proteases highly up-regulated in the angiogenic microvasculature of human gliomas (28Thorns V. Walter G.F. Thorns C. Anticancer Res. 2003; 23: 3937-3944PubMed Google Scholar, 29Wang M. Wang T. Liu S. Yoshida D. Teramoto A. Brain Tumor Pathol. 2003; 20: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), stimulated S2 and S4 shedding from brain MvEC. Growth factors, such as EGF, bFGF, and VEGF, increase MMP-2 and -9 activities in human anaplastic astrocytoma cells (31Rooprai H.K. Rucklidge G.J. Panou C. Pilkington G.J. Br. J. Cancer. 2000; 82: 52-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Thus, EGF, bFGF, and VEGF may increase S2 shedding through an up-regulation of MMPs, which could in turn cleave the ectodomain from the endothelial cell surface. To investigate the possible effects of S2 shedding on angiogenic processes, we mimicked the presence of soluble S2 or S4 ectodomain by adding recombinant ectodomain to brain MvEC. Syndecan-2ED stimulated a dose-dependent increase in MvEC migration on fibronectin. Syndecan-4ED also had an affect on migration, but this was biphasic with concentration, consistent with its role in focal adhesion formation. 3S. S. Nunes, C. M. Klass, V. Morandi, and A. Woods, manuscript in preparation. Soluble S1 secreted by transfected ARH-77 B lymphoid cells increased cell invasion through collagen type I (32Yang Y. Yaccoby S. Liu W. Langford J.K. Pumphrey C.Y. Theus A. Epstein J. Sanderson R.D. Blood. 2002; 100: 610-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), and increased S1 ectodomain shedding correlated with increased HT1080 cell migration on collagen (33Endo K. Takino T. Miyamori H. Kinsen H. Yoshizaki T. Furukawa M. Sato H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40764-40770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Soluble S2ED, but not S4ED, increased MvEC cell-cell interactions on growth factor-reduced Matrigel. This may promote the specific increase in capillary tube formation and decreased branching in the presence of S2ED. Syndecan-2 localization to the microvasculature of gliomas, its necessity for angiogenic processes in brain MvEC in vitro (shown here), and requirement for embryonic vascular sprouting (15Chen E. Hermanson S. Ekker S.C. Blood. 2004; 103: 1710-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) strongly implicate S2 as a regulator of neovascularization. Further research is needed to elucidate the specific mechanism(s) involved. Syndecan-2 may exert its effect via regulation of matrix assembly (e.g. basement membrane laminin) as shown previously (6Klass C.M. Couchman J.R. Woods A. J. Cell. Sci. 2000; 113: 493-506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), generation of a chemotactic gradient in a complex with growth factors (as shown for S1) (34Li Q. Park P.W. Wilson C.L. Parks W.C.

Whatever the mechanism, recombinant soluble S2ED that lacks glycanation is biologically effective and may be a target for novel anti-tumor/anti-angiogenic cancer therapies."

The channel subunits are ubiquitinated and co-immunoprecipitate with both epsin and clathrin adaptor proteins, and epsin, as expected, co-immunoprecipitates with clathrin adaptor proteins. The functional significance of these interactions was evaluated in a Xenopus oocyte expression system where co-expression of epsin and ENaC resulted in a down-regulation of ENaC activity; conversely, co-expression of epsin sub-domains acted as dominant-negative effectors and stimulated ENaC activity. These results identify epsin as an accessory protein linking ENaC to the clathrin-based endocytic machinery thereby regulating the activity of this ion channel at the cell surface.

Abnormalities of this channel contribute to the pathophysiology of a number of diseases including Liddle's syndrome, psuedo-hypoaldosteronism and cystic fibrosis (1Staub O. Abriel H. Plant P.

Nature. 1994; 367: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1789) Google Scholar). The channel complex is inefficiently processed with less than 20% of newly synthesized subunits reaching the apical membrane of endogenously expressing epithelia (3Rotin D. Kanelis V. Schild L. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: F391-F399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Valentijn J.A. Fyfe G.K. Canessa C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30344-30351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The apical membrane stability of these channels is a subject of dispute but it is widely agreed that ENaC is retrieved from the apical membrane by a process involving ubiquitination (6Staub O. Gautschi I. Ishikawa T. Breitschopf K. Ciechanover A. Schild L. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6325-6336Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Early studies in oocytes demonstrated that mutation of a C-terminal PY motif, or co-expression of a dominant negative dynamin, resulted in increased ENaC activity, consistent with regulation of surface expression by clathrin-mediated endocytosis (7Shimkets R.A. Lifton R.P. Canessa C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25537-25541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Subsequently it was recognized that the ubiquitin-protein ligase Nedd4-2 binds to the consensus PPXY (PY) motifs in the cytoplasmic tails of ENaC subunits via its WW domains and negatively regulates surface expression of the channel (1Staub O. Abriel H. Plant P. Ishikawa T. Kanelis V. Saleki K. Horisberger J.-D. Schild L. Rotin D. Kidney Intl. 2000; 57: 609-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 2Snyder P.M.

However, the role of clathrin-mediated endocytosis in this process is not well understood. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is a process by which specific membrane proteins are internalized from the plasma membrane by eukaryotic cells. Target proteins bind through classic motifs to adaptor proteins that link the cargo to clathrin lattices that deform the cell membrane to form a bud and ultimately an endocytic vesicle (8Mousavi S.A. Malerod L. Berg T. Kjeken R. Biochem. J. 2004; 377: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Membrane proteins that are modified by attachment of one or more ubiquitin molecules appear to be internalized by signals unlike the classic linear internalization motifs and may require binding to accessory proteins that link them to clathrin adaptors (9Hicke L. Dunn R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 141-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar). Proteins of the epsin family appear to be excellent candidates to function as adaptor coupling proteins because they contain ubiquitin interaction motifs (UIM) as well as clathrin binding motifs (10Wendland B. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 11Chen H. Fre S. Slepnev V.I. Capua M.R. Takei K. Butler M.H. Fiore P.P. Di DeCamilli P. Nature. 1998; 394: 793-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), and epsin has been shown to down-regulate ENaC activity when co-expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells (12Staruschenko A. Pochynyuk O. Stockand J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39161-39167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Epsin orthologs in Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans target monoubiquitinated ligands of the Notch pathway for endocytosis (13Overstreet E. Fitch E. Fischer J.A. Development. 2004; 131: 5355-5366Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 14Tian X. Hansen D. Schedl T. Skeath J.B.

However, direct experimental evidence for a role of epsins linking ubiquitinated cargo to clathrin-coated vesicles in mammalian cells is lacking (9Hicke L. Dunn R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 141-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar). The current studies were undertaken to examine the possibility that ENaC internalization involves clathrin-mediated endocytosis and to determine whether epsin is involved in linking ubiquitinated ENaC to clathrin adaptors. Reagents—Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to α and β ENaC were kindly provided by Dr. Kathi Peters (University of Pittsburgh; α ENaC) and Dr. Mark Knepper (Laboratory of Kidney and Electrolyte Metabolism, NHLBI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda MD; β ENaC) and their specificity in CCD cells has been described (16Butterworth M.B. Edinger R.S. Johnson J.P. Frizzell R.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 125: 81-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Chicken polyclonal antibody to γ ENaC has been described (17Weisz O.A. Wang J.-M. Edinger R.S. Johnson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39886-39893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). γ ENaC bands visualized by this antibody in CCD cells were competed by incubation with immunizing peptide (not shown). Mouse monoclonal antibody to ubiquitinylated proteins (clone FK2) was purchased from Biomol. Mouse monoclonal antibody to α adaptin was purchased from BD Biosciences, and EEA1 rabbit polyclonal antibody was a gift from Dr. Silvia Corvera. Antibodies to heavy chain clathrin, β and γ adaptin and epsin have been previously described (18Mishra S.K. Watkins S.C. Traub L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16099-16104Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal antibody to the N terminus of μ2 was the generous gift of Dr. Juan Bonifacino (NIH, Bethesda, MD). βR564X ENaC mutant was generated as previously described (19Carattino M.D. Hill W.G. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36202-36213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The full-length epsin 1 cDNA in pBluescript was a generous gift from Pietro de Camilli (Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT). The epsin DPW domain (residues Arg229 –Asp407 with a subsequent TAA stop codon) was amplified from this by PCR and then inserted into pcDNA3.1myc using the EcoRI and XbaI sites. The ENTH domain construct (Met1 –Ala163) was prepared by introduction of an Ala164 stop mutation in full-length epsin 1 inserted into pcDNA3.1myc as for the DPW domain. The proteins encoded by the pcDNA3.1myc vector have an N-terminal myc epitope tag. GST-epsin 1-(1–407) has been previously described (20Mishra S.K. Agostinelli N.R. Brett T.J. Mizukami I. Ross T.S. Traub L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46230-46236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). For construction of ENaC-ubiquitin conjugates, a plasmid containing three tandem ubiquitin (gift from G. Lukacs, Toronto) was amplified using unique primers containing a BspHI site on the 5′ primer. The product was cloned into pTopo-Blunt II (Invitrogen). The ubiquitin containing fragment was excised using BspHI and XhoI (in linker region) and cloned in-frame to the carboxyl end of α-ENaC that had been cleaved using NcoI and XhoI. Cloning into the NcoI site on α-ENaC results in the deletion of the final two amino acids of the native protein. For both β and γ ENaC a KpnI site was introduced before the termination codon and the ubiquitin construct was ligated into the KpnI site and a unique downstream restriction enzyme site. Lysine to arginine mutants of α and γ ENaC (αK47R,K50R and γK6–13R) (K6–13R is representative for K6R,K8R,K10R,K12R,K13R) were generated by substituting specific lysine residues with arginines using PCR-based mutagenesis as described (6Staub O. Gautschi I. Ishikawa T. Breitschopf K. Ciechanover A. Schild L. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6325-6336Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). All constructs were verified by automated dideoxynucleotide sequencing. The mpkCCDc14 cells (kindly provided by Alain Vandewalle and Marcelle Bens) were grown in flasks, tissue culture dishes, and Transwell porous supports. Growth medium was composed of equal volumes Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12, 60 nm sodium selenate, 5 μg/ml transferrin, 50 nm dexamethasone, 1 nm triiodothyronine, 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 5 μg/ml insulin, 20 mm d-glucose, 2% (v/v) fetal calf serum, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, at 37 °C in 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere. For all experiments the CCD cells were subcultured onto permeable filter supports (0.4 μm pore size, 4.5 and 44.2 cm2, Transwell, Corning Costar, Cambridge, MA) and were used for studies when transepithelial resistance measured with a portable EVOM (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, Fl) had reached a stable plateau indicating complete epithelial organization. Clathrin-coated Vesicle (CCV) Isolation—CCVs were isolated by a modification of the method of Metzler et al. (21Metzler M. Legendre-Guillemin V. Gan L. Chopra V. Kwok A. McPherson P.S. Hayden M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39271-39276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), CCD cells cultured on 44.2-cm2 filter supports were washed 3 times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline on ice. Cells were scraped and homogenized in isolation buffer containing 10 mm MES-NaOH, pH 6.5, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.02% NaN3, with protease inhibitors, using a Dounce homogenizer, then sonicated by 3 bursts of 10 s on ice. The homogenate was centrifuged at 17,800 × g for 20 min using Sorvall T865 rotor and Sorvall Discovery 90 centrifuge at 4 °C and the supernatant saved. The supernatant was sedimented at 56,000 × g for 1 h. The pellet was resuspended in 1.7 ml of isolation buffer and sheared through a 22-gauge needle 20 times. The redissolved pellet was added on top of an equal volume of 8% sucrose in isolation buffer made in D2O and centrifuged at 115,800 × g for 2 h (S120AT2–0112 rotor; Sorvall RC M120EX centrifuge). The final pellet represented the CCV preparation. CCVs were resuspended in 0.2–0.5 ml of RIPA buffer, frozen in liquid nitrogen, were kept at –80 °C for further study. Endosomal Preparation—CCD cells grown on filter supports were scraped into phosphate-buffered saline, pelleted, and resuspended in 600 μl of HB (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) containing protease inhibitors by passing through a 200–1000-μl pipette tip 10 times, then lysed by passing through a 22-gauge needle 20 times. Following a low speed spin, the post-nuclear supernatant was diluted 1:1 with 62% sucrose and placed at the bottom of a 4.4-ml polyclear centrifuge tube (Seton Scientific, Sunnyvale, CA). 1.5 ml of 35% sucrose was layered on top followed by 1.5 ml of 25% sucrose and 0.5 ml of HB. The gradients were centrifuged in a TST 60.1 rotor at 167,000 × g for 70 min at 4 °C, and the interfaces were collected. Protein-matched samples were run on SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with EEA1 and α ENaC. Quantitation of internalized horseradish peroxidase in gradient fractions was performed as described (17Weisz O.A. Wang J.-M. Edinger R.S. Johnson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39886-39893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Immunoblot and Immunoprecipitation—CCD cells grown on Transwell filters were lysed in CCD lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.4% sodium deoxycholate) with protein inhibitors, incubated on ice for 10 min. For experiments involving IP or immunoblot with ubiquitin antibody, 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide and 10 μm MG-132 were added to lysis buffer to inhibit deubiquitination. Without these agents in lysis buffer, we were unable to detect any interaction between ENaC and ubiquitin. After centrifugation at 4 °C for 10 min at 13,000 × g, the supernatant was recovered, and immunoprecipitation was performed with appropriate antibodies. The immunoprecipitated material, cell lysate, and CCV samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (8–10% polyacrylamide). Separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and then subjected to Western blot analysis with the appropriate antibodies and visualized using chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Protein Binding Studies—Pulldown-type assays were performed in 500 μl of total volume containing 100 μg of GST or the appropriate GST fusion protein first immobilized on 25 μl of GSH-Sepharose by incubation at 4 °C. The Sepharose beads containing the immobilized proteins were washed and resuspended in assay buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100. [35S]Methionine-labeled and in vitro translated ENaC or ENaC-Ub3 were added to the tubes and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with continuous gentle mixing. The GSH-Sepharose beads were then recovered by centrifugation and an aliquot of each supernatant was removed. The pellets were then washed and resuspended in sample buffer. Channel Expression in Xenopus Oocytes—Sequences for all wild type and mutant constructs were confirmed by automated DNA sequence analysis performed at the University of Pittsburgh DNA sequencing facility. Complimentary RNAs (cRNA) for wild type and mutant constructs were prepared using a cRNA synthesis kit employing T3 RNA polymerase (mMESSAGE mMachine, Ambion Inc., Austin, TX). Xenopus oocytes (stage V–VI) were pretreated with 2 mg/ml collagenase (type IV) in calcium-free saline solution. Murine ENaC cRNAs (1–3 ng/subunit in 50 nl of H2O) were microinjected into all oocytes. Oocytes in the experimental group were additionally injected with 5 ng of cRNA of epsin, the ENTH domain of epsin, or the DPW domain. All oocytes were incubated at 18 °C in modified Barth's saline (88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 0.3 mm Ca(NO3)2, 0.41 mm CaCl2, 0.82 mm MgSO4, 15 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.2) supplemented with 10 μg/ml sodium penicillin, 10 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 100 μg/ml gentamycin sulfate. Whole cell currents were measured 24–46 h after cRNA injections. To determine whether the effects of epsin on ENaC were specific, we examined ROMK expressing oocytes (22Lebowitz J. Edinger R.S. An B. Perry C.J. Onate S. Kleyman T.R. Johnson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41985-41990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) with and without epsin. Wild type ROMK cRNA (2 ng) was injected with or without epsin cRNA (5 ng). Whole Cell Current Measurements—A two-electrode voltage clamp technique was used as previously described (22Lebowitz J. Edinger R.S. An B. Perry C.J. Onate S. Kleyman T.R. Johnson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41985-41990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Whole cell inward amiloride-sensitive currents were measured in control oocytes expressing αβγ ENaC alone or experimental oocytes expressing αβγ ENaC + epsin, ENTH domain, or DPW domain, using a DigiData 1200 interface (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) and a TEV 200A Voltage Clamp amplifier (Dagan Corp., Minneapolis, MN). Data acquisition and analysis were performed using pClamp 7.0. Amiloride-sensitive currents were defined as the difference of the current in the absence and presence of 0.1 mm amiloride. Membrane potentials were clamped from –140 to +60 mV in 20-mV increments with duration of 900 ms. Currents were measured at a holding potential of –100 mV, 600 ms after initiation of the clamp potential. For ROMK measurements, whole cell K currents were measured at –100 mV in the absence or presence of 5 mm BaCl2. Cell Surface ENaC Labeling—Surface expression of ENaC was measured using a luminometric technique as described (22Lebowitz J. Edinger R.S. An B. Perry C.J. Onate S. Kleyman T.R. Johnson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41985-41990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Control oocytes expressing mouse α, β-FLAG, and γ ENaC subunits and experimental oocytes co-injected with αβflagγ ENaC and epsin were blocked with MBS supplemented with 1 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin (MBS-BSA) after 2 days of incubation. Oocytes were then exposed to MBS-BSA with 1 mg/ml of mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (M2, Sigma) at 4 °C for 1 h. Of note, β ENaC containing the FLAG epitope (DYDKKKD) at the extracellular loop does not alter INa relative to wild type ENaC expression. After the oocytes were labeled with primary antibody, they were washed six times in MBS-BSA at 4 °C and incubated in MBS-BSA supplemented with 1 mg/ml horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (peroxidase-conjugated AffiniPure F(ab′)2 fragment goat anti-mouse IgG, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA)) for 1 h at 4°C. After 12 additional washes, individual oocytes were placed in 100 ml of SuperSignal ELISA Femto solution (Pierce) and incubated at room temperature for 1 min. Chemiluminescence was quantified in arbitrary light units using a TD-20/20 luminometer with signal integration over a 60-s interval. To determine whether ENaC subunits were present in CCV, we employed a standard method (21Metzler M. Legendre-Guillemin V. Gan L. Chopra V. Kwok A. McPherson P.S. Hayden M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39271-39276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) for isolating these vesicles from a continuous line of mouse cortical collecting duct cells that express the channel endogenously (23Bens M. Vallet V. Cluzeaud F. Pascual-Letallec L. Kahn A. Rafestin-Oblin M.E. Rossier B.C. Vandewalle A. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 923-934Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Vandewalle A. Bens M. Duong Van Huyen J.P. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 1999; 8: 581-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). CCVs prepared from mpkCCDc14 (CCD cells) were first characterized in terms of enrichment of coat proteins and adaptors. A typical example of such a preparation is shown in Fig. 1A. Compared with the post-nuclear supernatant and crude microsomes, CCV were enriched in clathrin heavy chain, and adaptors found at Golgi (γ adaptin) and the plasma membrane (μ2). Typically, epsin was present but not markedly enriched in CCVs. Fig. 1B demonstrates that this CCV preparation was highly enriched in all three ENaC subunits. The pattern of subunit enrichment is interesting and deserves comment. We have recently observed that ENaC subunits expressed alone produce single bands on SDS gels by immunoblot:α at 95 kDa,β at 96 kDa, and γ at 93 kDa. However, when expressed together, a second band appears for each subunit (65 kDa for α, 110 kDa for β, and 75 kDa for γ). These appear to represent the processed forms of the subunits as they exhibit complex N-glycans and the α and γ subunits appear to undergo proteolytic processing (25Hughey R.P. Mueller G.M. Bruns J.B. Kinlough C.L. Poland P.A. Harkleroad K.L. Carattino M.D. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37073-37082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Both mature and immature forms of ENaC appear at the apical membrane (26Hughey R.P. Bruns J.B. Kinlough C.L. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48491-48494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The experiments describing ENaC subunit processing were carried out in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells overexpressing double epitope-tagged subunits (25Hughey R.P. Mueller G.M. Bruns J.B. Kinlough C.L. Poland P.A. Harkleroad K.L. Carattino M.D. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37073-37082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). In endogenously expressing epithelia, shorter forms of γ but not α ENaC have been reported following stimulation of ENaC activity by aldosterone (27Masilamani S. Kim G.-H. Mitchell C. Wade J.B. Knepper M.A. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: R19-R23Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). Complex glycosylation of ENaC has been reported in A6 cells, although with full-length γ ENaC (28Alvarez de la Rosa D. Li H. Canessa C.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 119: 427-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In CCD cells, CCVs appear to be enriched in the mature forms ofβ andγ ENaC, but only full-length α is demonstrated. To demonstrate endocytosis of the channel, we have taken advantage of the relatively rapid insertion and retrieval of ENaC in response to elevated cAMP. In CCD epithelia, forskolin stimulates rapid and parallel increases in ENaC currents and membrane capacitance (t½ ∼ 4.5 min). Its withdrawal results in equally rapid reversal of these capacitance and current responses, which are blocked by chloroquine, consistent with endocytic retrieval of ENaC (16Butterworth M.B. Edinger R.S. Johnson J.P. Frizzell R.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 125: 81-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). We have examined the appearance of α ENaC in early endosomes following forskolin withdrawal. Early endosomes were identified by their internalization of horseradish peroxidase (Fig. 2A) and they were isolated on a discontinuous sucrose gradient as previously described (17Weisz O.A. Wang J.-M. Edinger R.S. Johnson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39886-39893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Fractions enriched in EEA1, a marker for early endosomes, were enriched in the three ENaC subunits as well (Fig. 2B). Following forskolin withdrawal, there is a rapid increase in the α subunit of ENaC in early endosomes over a 10-min time course, which is typical of ENaC current decay kinetics (16Butterworth M.B. Edinger R.S. Johnson J.P. Frizzell R.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 125: 81-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2C). These data indicate that ENaC traffics through an early endosomal compartment following its endocytosis from the apical membrane within CCVs. To explore the relationship of ENaC subunits to adaptor proteins, co-immunoprecipitation studies were performed. CCD cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibodies specific for α, β, and γ ENaC and analyzed for the presence of epsin by immunoblot. Fig. 3A shows that epsin was efficiently co-immunoprecipitated by all three ENaC subunits. Furthermore, the subunits of ENaC were found to be ubiquitinated under these assay conditions. Fig. 3B demonstrates that both α and β ENaC when immunoprecipitated from CCD lysates can be detected with antibodies specific for ubiquitin. In addition, immunoprecipitations performed with anti-ubiquitin are positive for both α and β ENaC when probed with ENaC specific antibodies. IP with γ ENaC was also positive for ubiquitin, but we could not demonstrate that IP with ubiquitin could show the presence of γ ENaC (not shown). As a control, we demonstrated that the ubiquitin antibody could also co-IP epsin, which is known to be ubiquitinated (29Polo S. Sigismund S. Faretta M. Guidi M. Capua M.R. Bossi G. Chen H. DeCamilli P. Di Fiore P.P. Nature. 2002; 416: 451-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). With regard to ENaC, the results are somewhat surprising because previous studies in overexpression systems have shown that α and γ ENaC, but not β ENaC are polyubiquitinated (1Staub O. Abriel H. Plant P. Ishikawa T. Kanelis V. Saleki K. Horisberger J.-D. Schild L. Rotin D. Kidney Intl. 2000; 57: 609-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In A6 cells that endogenously express the channel, ubiquitination of all three subunits has recently been shown, including 1–3 ubiquitins on α ENaC and 2–3 ubiquitins on β ENaC. Higher levels of ubiquitination were seen following incubation of cells with MG-132 (30Malik B. Schlanger L. Al Khalili O. Bao H.F. Yue G. Price S.R. Mitch W.E. Eaton D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12903-12910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that at least two of the subunits of this heteromeric channel are ubiquitinated indicating that ENaC is a multiubiquitinated hetero-oligomer. Fig. 3C demonstrates that epsin antibody also co-immunoprecipitated α adaptin. An antibody to the N terminus of the μ2 subunit of adaptin immunoprecipitated α and β ENaC (Fig. 3D). Taken together, these studies show direct interactions between ENaC and ubiquitin, ENaC and epsin, and both ENaC and epsin with adaptors. This multisubunit complex is in full accord with the known binding determinants of these proteins. To determine whether the interaction between ENaC subunits and epsin required ENaC ubiquitination, we performed pulldown experiments examining the interaction between ENaC and the UIM motif of epsin. We in vitro translated α, β, and γ ENaC, or each ENaC subunit fused to three tandem ubiquitins in the presence of [35S]methionine and incubated with GST alone, GST-UIM, or GST-epsin, then pulled down the GST constructs with glutathione-Sepharose beads. Interactions between translated subunits and fusion proteins will shift the translated proteins from supernatant to pellet. As shown in Fig. 4, each ENaC subunit is found in pellet when conjugated to ubiquitin. There is a small amount of ENaC alone that is bound to GST-epsin, but the major shift of subunits from supernatant to pellet is seen with ubiquitinated forms. These experiments demonstrate that ENaC interacts with epsin strongly when ubiquitinated and that the UIM domain of epsin is sufficient for this interaction. To examine the significance of the interaction between ENaC and epsin, the Xenopus oocyte expression system was employed. Although previous studies have demonstrated that ENaC activity in oocytes is negatively regulated by Nedd4-2, we examined this first as a baseline for further experiments. All three ENaC subunits were expressed, with or without Nedd4-2, and ENaC activity was measured as amiloride-sensitive current using the two-electrode voltage clamp as described (22Lebowitz J. Edinger R.S. An B. Perry C.J. Onate S. Kleyman T.R. Johnson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41985-41990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Fig. 5A demonstrates that co-expression of Nedd4-2 markedly down-regulated ENaC activity in oocytes as previously shown (1Staub O. Abriel H. Plant P. Ishikawa T. Kanelis V. Saleki K.

We next examined the effect of epsin on ENaC activity in oocytes by expressing αβγ ENaC with or without fulllength epsin. As shown in Fig. 5B, epsin down-regulated ENaC activity almost to the extent seen with expression of Nedd4-2, consistent with a role for epsin in promoting endocytosis of the channel. The effect of epsin on ENaC surface expression was measured using a FLAG-tagged β ENaC coexpressed with wild-type αγ ENaC. We have previously shown that this construct behaves similarly to wild type αβγ ENaC in oocytes (22Lebowitz J. Edinger R.S. An B. Perry C.J. Onate S. Kleyman T.R. Johnson J.P. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2065010411,"Early growth response (EGR) transactivators act as critical regulators of several physiological processes, including peripheral nerve myelination and progression of prostate cancer. The NAB1 and NAB2 (NGFI-A/EGR1-binding protein) transcriptional corepressors directly interact with three EGR family members (Egr1/NGFI-A/zif268, Egr2/Krox20, and Egr3) and repress activation of their target promoters. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying NAB repression, we found that EGR activity is modulated by at least two repression domains within NAB2, one of which uniquely requires interaction with the CHD4 (chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 4) subunit of the NuRD (nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase) chromatin remodeling complex. Both NAB proteins can bind either CHD3 or CHD4, indicating that the interaction is conserved among these two protein families. Furthermore, we show that repression of the endogenous Rad gene by NAB2 involves interaction with CHD4 and demonstrate colocalization of NAB2 and CHD4 on the Rad promoter in myelinating Schwann cells. Finally, we show that interaction with CHD4 is regulated by alternative splicing of the NAB2 mRNA.

The NAB1 and NAB2 corepressors interact with a conserved domain found within Egr1 (also called NGFI-A/zif268), Egr2/Krox20, and Egr3 (1Russo M.W. Sevetson B.R. Milbrandt J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

The remaining family member, Egr4/NGFI-C, shares substantial homology with other EGR family members but lacks the NAB interaction domain and is therefore resistant to NAB repression. Members of the EGR family play diverse physiological roles, including having both positive and negative effects on growth. For example, Egr1 null fibroblasts bypass senescence because of reduced expression of the p53 gene (4Krones-Herzig A. Adamson E. Mercola D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3233-3238Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). On the other hand, EGR1 overexpression is also involved in the development of prostate cancer (5Thigpen A.E. Cala K.M.

Several experiments in various systems have established that NAB corepressors are important regulators of EGR activity. NAB1 and NAB2 both repress EGR activation of several promoters (3Sevetson B.R.

Interestingly, although EGR1 is overexpressed in prostate cancer (5Thigpen A.E. Cala K.M. Guileyardo J.M. Molberg K.H. McConnell J.D. Russell D.W. J. Urol. 1996; 155: 975-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 6Eid M.A. Kumar M.V. Iczkowski K.A. Bostwick D.G. Tindall D.J. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2461-2468PubMed Google Scholar), NAB2 expression is reduced in a majority of prostate cancer samples (27Abdulkadir S.A. Carbone J.M. Naughton C.K. Humphrey P.A. Catalona W.J. Milbrandt J. Hum. Pathol. 2001; 32: 935-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This observation is consistent with the idea that derepression of EGR1 activity is a progression factor in prostate cancer. The importance of NAB regulation is underscored by the identification of a recessive mutation in the NAB-binding domain of EGR2 (I268N) in a family affected with an inherited form of congenital hypomyelinating neuropathy (28Warner L.E. Mancias P. Butler I.J. McDonald C.M. Keppen L. Koob K.G. Lupski J.R. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 382-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 29Warner L.E. Svaren J. Milbrandt J. Lupski J.R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1245-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Congenital hypomyelinating neuropathy resembles the non-myelinating phenotype of the peripheral nervous system observed in Egr2/Krox20-deficient mice (13Topilko P. Schneider-Maunoury S. Levi G. Baron-Van Evercooren A. Chennoufi A.B.Y. Seitanidou T. Babinet C. Charnay P. Nature. 1994; 371: 796-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Similarly, a double knock-out of the NAB1 and NAB2 genes causes early lethality and impaired myelination (30Le N. Nagarajan R. Wang J.Y. Svaren J. LaPash C. Araki T. Schmidt R.E. Milbrandt J. Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 932-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), indicating that NAB corepressors are required for peripheral nerve myelination. Although diverse physiological data have demonstrated that NAB corepressors play a critical role in regulation of EGR activity, the molecular mechanism by which these corepressors act has remained elusive. NAB1 and NAB2 share a high degree of homology (2Svaren J. Sevetson B.R. Apel E.D. Zimonjic D.B. Popescu N.C. Milbrandt J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3545-3553Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) and are able to homo- and heteromultimerize with each other (22Svaren J. Sevetson B.R. Golda T. Stanton J.J. Swirnoff A.H. Milbrandt J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6010-6019Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). NAB1 and NAB2 are nuclear proteins, and they repress when tethered to active promoters by fusion to a Gal4 DNA-binding domain (DBD) (31Swirnoff A.H. Apel E.D. Svaren J. Sevetson B.R. Zimonjic D.B. Popescu N.C. Milbrandt J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 512-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that NAB proteins recruit other proteins in order to regulate EGR activity. We now show that the C-terminal domain of NAB2 interacts with the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 4 (CHD4) subunit of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex and that this interaction is required for repression by this domain. Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—The yeast two-hybrid screen (32Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 20Google Scholar) was performed in the Molecular Interaction Facility, University of Wisconsin Biotechnology Center. Mouse embryonic and brain libraries in pGAD-T7Rec (BD Biosciences) were screened with a construct containing amino acids 130–525 of the NAB2 protein fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain in pBUTE (a kanamycin-resistant version of GAL4 bait vector pGBDUC1). Approximately 18 million clones were screened via mating in yeast strain PJ694. After isolation of prey plasmids from positive pools, 18 plasmids were positive after retransformation into the bait-containing strain. Of these, two contained clones of mouse CHD4. Plasmids—Segments of the CHD4 (containing amino acids 1281–1915) and CHD3-(Δ1–1311) genes were cloned in-frame with an N-terminal 3× FLAG epitope in the pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen). Human HA-NAB2 (containing amino acids 34–525) was generated by introducing a C-terminal HA epitope. Deletion of amino acids 251 to 353 in HA-NAB2 was used to create NAB2ΔNCD2 (NCD1+CID), and NAB2ΔCID (NCD1+NCD2) lacks amino acids 386–525. The last 18 amino acids are excluded in the construct NAB2Δ507–525. The CID construct consists of amino acids 357–525, including the nuclear localization sequence to permit nuclear translocation. For NAB2 constructs lacking NCD1, translation initiation occurred at Met-141. A naturally occurring splice variant of NAB2 lacks amino acids 426–489 (exon 6 of NAB2). The indicated NAB2 segments were fused to the Gal4 DBD in pM1 (33Sadowski I. Ptashne M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 177539Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). The altered specificity version of Egr2 was generated by mutagenesis of the second zinc finger from SRSDHLTTHIR to SQSVHLQSHSR, as described for Egr1 (34Choo Y. Castellanos A. Garcia-Hernandez B. Sanchez-Garcia I. Klug A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 525-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The corresponding reporter plasmid was created by inserting nine repeats of an altered EGR2 binding site (GCGTGAGCG) into the pGL2 vector (Promega) containing the adenovirus E1B TATA element. For mammalian two-hybrid experiments, amino acids 1281–1915 of CHD4 were fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain in the pM1 vector. The NAB2VP16 construct was created by fusing the VP16 activation domain to the C terminus of NAB2, as described for the NAB1-VP16 construct (31Swirnoff A.H. Apel E.D. Svaren J. Sevetson B.R. Zimonjic D.B. Popescu N.C. Milbrandt J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 512-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Constructs for NAB1ΔNCD1-(Δ2–210), the luciferase reporter containing the thymidine kinase promoter with five upstream Gal4 binding sites, and the Gal4 reporter containing a minimal TATA element have been described previously (31Swirnoff A.H. Apel E.D. Svaren J. Sevetson B.R. Zimonjic D.B. Popescu N.C. Milbrandt J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 512-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Coimmunoprecipitation Analysis—QT6 (Quail fibroblast) or 293T cells were cultured as described previously (35Apel E.D. Roberds S.L. Campbell K.P. Merlie J.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 115-126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), plated at a density of 5 × 105 cells/ml, and transfected using LT-1 (Mirus) transfection reagent according to manufacturer's protocol. Bluescript plasmid (Stratagene) was included as needed to make a total of 2 μg/well/6-well plate. After 48 h, cells were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline and extracted with lysis buffer containing 6% glycerol, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 200 mm NaCl, with the addition of Complete Mini protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) for 10 min at room temperature. The lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C. 50 μl (or 200 μl; see Fig. 2C) of the supernatant was mixed with 25 μl of anti-HA rat monoclonal affinity matrix (Roche Applied Science) in lysis buffer containing 100 mm NaCl (final concentration). After incubation for 2 h at room temperature on a rocking platform, the matrix was washed five times with 250 μl of binding buffer. The reciprocal immunoprecipitation used M2 anti-FLAG-agarose beads (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. After the final wash, proteins were eluted by boiling for 2 min in 1× Laemmli buffer prior to immunoblotting using antibodies directed against the FLAG epitope (M2, Sigma), HA epitope (rat monoclonal from Roche Applied Science or rabbit polyclonal from Sigma), or CHD3/4 (BD Biosciences 611846). Other antibodies used were: α-tubulin (Santa Cruz sc-5546), CHD3/4 (Santa Cruz sc-11378), and Egr2 (Covance PRB236P). Membranes were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) and detected using West Pico or West Dura chemiluminescence detection reagents (Pierce). Cell Culture and Transfections—For reporter assays, JEG3 cells (human trophoblast cell line) were cultured in minimal essential medium supplemented with 5% bovine growth serum. Transfections were carried out in duplicate in 12-well plates seeded with 3 × 104 cells/well. Unless otherwise indicated, cells were transfected with 250 ng of the indicated luciferase reporter plasmid, 100 ng of a LacZ reporter driven by a cytomegalovirus promoter, the indicated expression plasmids, and pBluescript as required to make a total of 1 μg of DNA/well using LT-1 transfection reagent (Mirus). After 48 h, cells were harvested, and the level of luciferase activity was measured and normalized to β-galactosidase activity, which was measured using the GalactoLight Plus kit (Applied Biosystems). A custom SMARTpool mixture of four short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) directed against human CHD4 and the control siRNA (siCONTROL nontargeting siRNA 1) were purchased from Dharmacon. JEG3 or 293 cells were transfected with 62.5 pm siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000 as recommended by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). For reporter assays in the presence of siRNA, JEG3 cells were simultaneously transfected with siRNA and the plasmids described above using Lipofectamine 2000. Luciferase and β-galactosidase assays were then carried out 48 h later as described above. Primary rat Schwann cells were cultured and infected as described (19Nagarajan R. Svaren J. Le N. Araki T. Watson M. Milbrandt J. Neuron. 2001; 30: 355-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) using recombinant adenoviruses prepared using the AdEasy system (36He T.C.

After 48 h, purified RNA was analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR using SYBR Green dye as described (8Svaren J. Ehrig T. Abdulkadir S.A. Ehrengruber M.U. Watson M.A. Milbrandt J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38524-38531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) on a TaqMan 7000 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). Relative amounts of the human and rat RAD genes were determined using the Comparative Ct method (37Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods (San Diego). 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (127155) Google Scholar) and normalized to the relative levels of 18 S rRNA. Primer sequences are available upon request. PCR—Primers flanking the exon 6 region of NAB2 (GGTTGGAGAACAGAGTCACAATGA and GGCAGCGGTCCAGCAA) were used to amplify the full-length and alternately spliced forms of NAB2 from cDNA prepared from various mouse tissues. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays—All experiments were performed in strict accordance with experimental protocols approved by the University of Wisconsin School of Veterinary Medicine. After euthanasia of Sprague-Dawley rat pups at postnatal day 11 (P11), sciatic nerves were dissected (pooled from seven pups) and immediately minced in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% formaldehyde for 25 min at room temperature. Nerves were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0 (with a 1:1000 dilution of Sigma protease inhibitor mixture), and homogenized using the Tissue Tearor (biospec). Triton X-100 was added to 0.3%, and the lysate was sonicated in the presence of 100 mg of glass beads, alternating 10-s pulses with 50 s of cooling for a total of 20 min. Sonicated chromatin (containing 300 μg of protein as determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay) was used for each immunoprecipitation, and 10% of this amount was saved as an input. Lysates were incubated with 2 μg of anti-Egr2/Krox20 (Covance), anti-Nab2 (Santa Cruz), anti-CHD3/4 rabbit polyclonal (Santa Cruz sc-11378), or normal rabbit IgG (Upstate) control antibody. Immune complexes were collected with 25 μl of a protein G-agarose slurry (Pierce) blocked with herring sperm DNA (Fisher) and 0.5 mg of bovine serum albumin. Beads were washed in low salt buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris 8.1, 150 mm NaCl) and high salt buffer (same buffer containing 500 mm NaCl) followed by 0.25 m LiCl, 1% IGEPAL, 1% deoxycholic acid, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.1. All buffers contained a 1:1000 dilution of Sigma Protease inhibitor mixture. Complexes were eluted with 1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3, and 200 mm NaCl. Cross-links were reversed by heating at 65 °C for 5 h, and DNA was purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Quantitative PCR was performed on the same samples in duplicate. Values are expressed as percent recovery relative to the input DNA. Sequence analysis of the Rad gene identified potential Egr2 sites conforming to the previously defined consensus Egr2 binding site (38Swirnoff A.H. Milbrandt J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2275-2287Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Primers used for analysis are: Rad -1470, ACCCCCACCACAGTCATTGT and CTTTGGGACAGGAACTTGCTCT; Rad–130, GGGTAAGGGCTGGTAGAGGTTT and CGCTGGATCGCGGTTCT; IMG2a, GAAATTCTGCCCTGCACTTCC and GCTTTGCATTGAGGGAGGATC. CHD4 Interacts with NAB2—NAB1 and NAB2 contain two highly conserved domains called NAB conserved domains 1 and 2 (NCD1 and NCD2). NCD1 is necessary for interaction with EGR proteins and is also required for multimerization of NAB proteins (2Svaren J. Sevetson B.R. Apel E.D. Zimonjic D.B. Popescu N.C. Milbrandt J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3545-3553Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 22Svaren J. Sevetson B.R. Golda T. Stanton J.J. Swirnoff A.H. Milbrandt J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6010-6019Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Repression by NAB1 was shown to require NCD2 as well as other regions near the C terminus (31Swirnoff A.H. Apel E.D. Svaren J. Sevetson B.R. Zimonjic D.B. Popescu N.C. Milbrandt J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 512-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). To identify interacting proteins that might mediate repression by NAB2, we employed a yeast two-hybrid screen of mouse brain and embryonic libraries for proteins that interact with amino acids 130–525 of NAB2. This screen identified two independent clones of a C-terminal portion of CHD4 (Fig. 1A). CHD4 is an ATP-dependent, nucleosome remodeling subunit of the NuRD complex, which has been shown to repress promoters to which it is targeted (reviewed in Refs. 39Becker P.B. Horz W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 247-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar, 40Feng Q. Zhang Y. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2003; 274: 269-290PubMed Google Scholar, 41Bowen N.J. Fujita N. Kajita M. Wade P.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1677: 52-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). None of the other interacting clones encoded NuRD subunits. Additional evidence for NAB2/CHD4 interaction was provided by a mammalian two-hybrid analysis (Fig. 1B), in which the CHD4 C terminus was fused to the Gal4 DBD and NAB2 was fused to the VP16 activation domain. Cotransfection of these two constructs with a luciferase reporter containing Gal4 binding sites resulted in a significant increase in luciferase activity compared with transfection of either construct alone. The potential interaction between CHD4 and NAB2 was tested independently in vivo using a coimmunoprecipitation assay with epitope-tagged versions of NAB2 and the CHD4 C terminus (CHD4Δ1–1280). The CHD4 construct was immunoprecipitated by the anti-HA antibody only in the presence of the HA-tagged NAB2 (Fig. 1C). Conversely, co-immunoprecipitation of NAB2 by anti-FLAG was dependent on expression of FLAG-tagged CHD4 (Fig. 1D). Identification of the CHD4-interacting Domain of NAB2—Deletion analysis of NAB1 implicated the NCD2 domain and the extreme C terminus in transcriptional repression (31Swirnoff A.H. Apel E.D. Svaren J. Sevetson B.R. Zimonjic D.B. Popescu N.C. Milbrandt J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 512-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Based on these studies, HA-tagged versions of NAB2 were generated that contained a deletion of the NCD2 domain, the C terminus (amino acids 386–525), or the C-terminal 18 amino acids (Fig. 2A). To eliminate the possibility that any of these proteins might interact indirectly with CHD4 as a result of multimerizing with endogenous NAB proteins, the NCD1 domain was deleted from these constructs. Interestingly, analysis of these mutant proteins revealed that the NCD2 domain was not essential for interaction with CHD4 (Fig. 2B). Deletion of the 18 amino acids at the C terminus of the NAB2 protein also failed to disrupt interaction with CHD4. However, removal of amino acids 386–525 of the NAB2 protein prevented interaction with CHD4. Furthermore, expression of amino acids 386–525, together with the nuclear localization signal, was sufficient for interaction with CHD4. This C-terminal region of NAB2 was therefore designated as the CID (CHD4-interacting domain). We also tested whether NAB2 could interact with endogenous CHD4 by transfecting cells with the indicated NAB2 constructs in the absence of transfected CHD4. After immunoprecipitation of NAB2 with anti-HA, we were able to detect associated CHD3/CHD4, which was not observed using a NAB2 construct in which the CID was deleted (Fig. 2C). NAB/CHD Interaction Is Conserved among Family Members—The antibody used in the endogenous assay in Fig. 2C detects both CHD3 and CHD4. CHD4 shares several regions of homology with CHD3, including not only the ATPase, PHD, and chromodomains but also other regions within the C terminus (42Thompson P.M. Gotoh T. Kok M. White P.S. Brodeur G.M. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 1002-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In addition, CHD3 has been found in NuRD-like complexes (43Xue Y. Wong J. Moreno G.T. Young M.K. Cote J. Wang W. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 851-861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar, 44Tong J.K. Hassig C.A. Schnitzler G.R. Kingston R.E. Schreiber S.L.

Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 428-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), suggesting that its molecular role is at least partially redundant to that of CHD4. To test a potential interaction of CHD3 with NAB2, a comparable portion of the C-terminal domain of CHD3 (CHD3Δ1–1311) was epitope-tagged and found to associate with NAB2 (Fig. 3A) in a coimmunoprecipitation assay. In addition, NAB1 and NAB2 share a considerable degree of homology, and in functional assays, we have never observed any substantial differences in their ability to repress EGR-mediated transcription (2Svaren J. Sevetson B.R. Apel E.D. Zimonjic D.B. Popescu N.C. Milbrandt J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3545-3553Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 3Sevetson B.R. Svaren J. Milbrandt J. J. Biol.

As shown in Fig. 3B, NAB1 can also interact with CHD4, suggesting that NAB1 and NAB2 share the capacity to repress transcription by interacting with CHD3 and CHD4. Disruption of NAB2 Function by Dominant Negative CHD4 Constructs—There have been several biochemical characterizations of mammalian NuRD complexes, but none of these studies has identified NAB2 as a stably associated subunit (43Xue Y.

Accordingly, the observed coimmunoprecipitation of transfected NAB2 and CHD4 might reflect a more transient association involved in NuRD recruitment to EGR target genes rather than a stable complex. Therefore, we proceeded to test whether endogenous CHD4 is a functional requirement for repression by NAB2. Dominant negative CHD4 mutants were used to test the involvement of CHD4 in repression by NAB2. We tested whether expression of the CHD4 C terminus (CHD4Δ1–1280) could interfere with NAB repression in a dominant negative manner, because it binds to NAB2 but lacks the ATPase and other domains required for CHD4 function. In addition, we created a full-length dominant negative CHD4 protein by mutating a conserved lysine (Lys-750) in the ATPase domain (referred to as CHD4K750C). Analogous mutations have been successfully used to create dominant negatives to study ATPase-dependent chromatin remodeling comple"

The Rho family of small GTPases, which includes Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, is ubiquitously expressed and plays a pivotal role in the regulation of a wide variety of cellular processes, including cell adhesion and migration, cytokinesis, cell cycle progression, and gene expression (1Van Aelst L.

Like all GTPases, Rho acts as a molecular switch by cycling between two different conformational states, GTP-bound (active) and GDP-bound (inactive) forms. The GTP-bound form of Rho binds its effectors to elicit cellular responses. A number of Rho effector molecules have been identified (5Matsui T. Amano M. Yamamoto T. Chihara K. Nakafuku M. Ito M.

Among them, a family of Ser/Thr protein kinase, ROCK 2The abbreviations used are: ROCK, Rho-associated coiled-coil protein kinase; BES, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]ethanesulfonic acid; MBS, myosin-binding subunit of myosin phosphatase; CAT, catalytic domain; RB, Rho-binding; PH, pleckstrin homology; CBP, CREB-binding protein; CH3, cysteine/histidine-rich domain 3; GST, glutathione S-transferase; CSK, cytoskeleton; HAT, histone acetyltransferase; NLS, nuclear localization signal; DAPI, 4′-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; PIPES, piperazine-N,N′-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid); GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CMV, cytomegalovirus. (also called Rho kinase/ROK), has been the subject of extensive studies and appears to mediate the majority of Rho GTPase functions (9Amano M. Fukata Y. Kaibuchi K. Exp.

A broad range of cellular activities of Rho and ROCK is thought to be mediated primarily through the regulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics (9Amano M. Fukata Y. Kaibuchi K. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 261: 44-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 10Riento K. Ridley A.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 446-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (1581) Google Scholar). ROCK phosphorylates and activates LIM kinase, which in turn phosphorylates cofilin and inhibits its actin-depolymerizing activity, leading to increased actin polymerization (10Riento K. Ridley A.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 446-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (1581) Google Scholar). ROCK also phosphorylates the myosin-binding subunit (MBS) of myosin phosphatase and inactivates the phosphatase activity, which results in increased myosin phosphorylation and contractility (10Riento K. Ridley A.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 446-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (1581) Google Scholar). Two members of the ROCK family, ROCK1 and ROCK2, have been identified. There is 65% identity in their overall amino acid sequences, and they share several common domains (11Nakagawa O. Fujisawa K. Ishizaki T. Saito Y. Nakao K. Narumiya S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 189-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Although ROCK1 and ROCK2 appear to have different activities on a cellular level (12Yoneda A. Multhaupt H.A. Couchman J.R. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 443-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), there has been little difference identified in phenotypes of ROCK1- and ROCK2-null mice, suggesting possible functional redundancy between the two ROCK isoforms (10Riento K.

Genes Cells. 2005; 10: 825-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). ROCK has three main domains critical for its functions: the N-terminal catalytic domain (CAT), a coiled-coil domain in the middle portion that mediates homodimerization, and the C-terminal Rho-binding (RB) and pleckstrin homology (PH) domains (RB/PH domain) (11Nakagawa O.

The RB/PH domain acts as an autoinhibitory domain by binding the CAT and suppressing its kinase activity in vitro. Consistently, when expressed in cells, the RB/PH domain alone can act as a dominant negative mutant (15Amano M. Chihara K. Nakamura N. Kaneko T. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol.

Conversely, various ROCK mutants lacking the RB/PH domain but retaining the CAT act as a constitutively active mutant (14Amano M. Chihara K. Nakamura N. Fukata Y. Yano T. Shibata M. Ikebe M.

Such active ROCK mutants are naturally created during apoptosis: ROCK1 and ROCK2 can be cleaved by caspase-3 and granzyme B, respectively. These cleavages cause the loss of the C-terminal autoinhibitory domain containing the PH domain and the generation of active forms of ROCKs that contribute to the generation of cytoplasmic apoptotic features, such as apoptotic bleb (19Coleman M.L.

In certain cases, activation of Rho signaling may trigger translocation of transcriptional coactivators into the nucleus (26Muller J.M. Metzger E. Greschik H. Bosserhoff A.K. Mercep L. Buettner R.

In contrast to conventional Rho signaling initiated within the cytoplasm, several studies reported the existence of nucleus-localized Rho family members and their regulators; RhoA and RhoB have been detected in the nucleus by biochemical fractionation and immunofluorescence (34Balboa M.A. Insel P.A.

Two Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors, Net1 and ECT2, are present primarily in the nucleus (38Tatsumoto T. Xie X. Blumenthal R. Okamoto I. Miki T. J.

These findings are in line with the potential presence of nuclear Rho signaling, although more studies are needed to establish their nucleus-specific functions. Two paralogous acetyltransferases, p300 and CBP (p300/CBP), are recruited to specific gene promoters by associating with sequence-specific transcription factors and modulate the promoter activities by acetylating both histones and nonhistone substrates (41Goodman R.H. Smolik S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1553-1577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Chan H.M. La Thangue N.B. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2363-2373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to acetyltransferase activities, p300/CBP have intrinsic transcriptional activation domains at their N and C termini (43Yuan W. Condorelli G. Caruso M. Felsani A. Giordano A. J. Biol.

To better understand the regulatory mechanisms affecting p300 function, we sought new p300-interacting proteins using the yeast two-hybrid system and identified ROCK2 as a candidate p300-interacting protein. Since p300 and ROCK2 have been previously localized predominantly in the nucleus and cytoplasm, respectively (5Matsui T. Amano M. Yamamoto T. Chihara K. Nakafuku M. Ito M. Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2208-2216Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar, 41Goodman R.H. Smolik S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1553-1577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 51Leung T. Chen X.Q. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5313-5327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), our finding raises a critical question of which subcellular compartment might be the site of their interaction. Interestingly, by an independent approach, we identified ROCK2 as associated with a second nuclear protein, MLH1 (MutL homologue 1), which was involved in DNA base mismatch repair. Furthermore, by subcellular fractionation, ROCK2 was localized in the nucleus at a concentration comparable with the cytoplasm, and within the nucleus, ROCK2 was detected in the soluble nucleoplasmic fraction as well as the chromatin and nuclear matrix fractions. 3T. Tanaka, D. Nishimura, H. Nishida, K. Kaibuchi, and Y. Hamamori, submitted for publication. Here, we show by several approaches that p300 associates with ROCK2 both in vitro and in intact cells. ROCK2 phosphorylates p300 in vitro, and nucleus-restricted expression of a constitutively active ROCK2 mutant induces p300 phosphorylation in cells. We find that acetyltransferase activity of p300 is dependent on its phosphorylation status in cells, and p300 phosphorylation by ROCK2 causes an increased acetyltransferase activity in vitro. These observations suggest that nuclear ROCK2 associates with p300, phosphorylates p300, and enhances its acetyltransferase activity through a phosphorylation-dependent mechanism. Plasmids—The plasmids for GST-p300 fragments were kindly provided by Dr. Hottiger (University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland) (52Hasan S. Hassa P.O. Imhof R. Hottiger M.O.

(Santa Cruz, CA). Mouse monoclonal p300 antibody (NM11) was from BD Biosciences. Normal rabbit IgG and β-tublin were from Sigma. Tissue Culture and Transient Transfection—HeLa, 293T, and U2OS cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transfection was performed by the BES-buffered saline protocol as described (47Hamamori Y. Sartorelli V. Ogryzko V. Puri P.L. Wu H.Y. Wang J.Y. Nakatani Y. Kedes L.

In vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled proteins were prepared using the TNT coupled transcription-translation system (Promega). For GST-p300 pull-down experiments with endogenous ROCK2, whole cell extracts were prepared by incubating cells in the NETN buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with freshly prepared protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, and aprotinin). Five hundred-microgram extracts were incubated with ∼100 ng of GST fusion proteins. For co-immunoprecipitation studies, 1 mg of whole cell extracts or nuclear extracts were incubated with 4 μgof either anti-p300 (N-15) or control normal mouse IgG overnight, followed by incubation of protein A-agarose (Sigma) for 2 h at 4 °C. After washing four times, bound proteins were detected by Western analysis with anti-ROCK2 antibody (H-85). Immunofluorescence Analysis—Cells were fixed with methanol or 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 10 min and were permeabilized for 10 min in HBS-PBS (5% horse serum, 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% saponin in PBS). After three washings with PBS, the cells were incubated with primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature and then with Cy3- or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma) in HBS-PBS for 1 h at room temperature with vigorous washings after incubation with each antibody. DAPI staining was performed to show chromatin DNA. To test the specificity of ROCK2 (H-85) and ROCK1 (H-85) antibodies, an excess of GST-ROCK2-H85 or GST-ROCK1-H85 protein (40-fold excess over the antibodies in molar ratio) was preincubated with the primary antibodies. Subcellular fractionation for immunofluorescence studies was performed as described (56Stenoien D.L. Patel K. Mancini M.G. Dutertre M. Smith C.L. O'Malley B.W. Mancini M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated with CSK buffer (10 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 300 mm sucrose, 100 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, and the proteinase inhibitors) for 3 min on ice to give insoluble chromatin plus nuclear matrix fractions. Chromatin was removed by digesting genomic DNA with RNase-free DNase I (400 units/ml; Roche Applied Science) in the digestion buffer (CSK plus 50 mm NaCl and proteinase inhibitors) for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were further treated with ammonium sulfate to a final concentration of 0.25 m for 5 min at room temperature and incubated with 2 m NaCl for 5 min at room temperature, with washings with the digestion buffer after each treatment, to give nuclear matrix. Cells were stained after each treatment, using polyclonal rabbit anti-ROCK2 (H-85) and mouse monoclonal p300 (NM11) antibodies. Cells were examined using an Axioplan2 microscope (Carl Zeiss Inc.). Subcellular Fractionation—Subcellular fractionation was performed as described (53Kawano Y. Fukata Y. Oshiro N. Amano M. Nakamura T. Ito M. Matsumura F. Inagaki M. Kaibuchi K. J.

Cells were homogenized in buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, and the proteinase inhibitors) with a Dounce homogenizer. The homogenates were loaded onto 1 m sucrose (final concentration at 270 mm) and centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 10 min. The precipitates contained nuclei. The supernatant fraction was further centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min, and the resulting supernatant was used as cytoplasmic fraction. The precipitates containing nuclei were resuspended in buffer A and centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 5 min. The pellet that contains almost only nuclei under phase-contrast microscopy was resuspended in CSK buffer, and the soluble nucleoplasmic proteins were extracted by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min. The pellet that contained a mixture of insoluble chromatin and nuclear matrix was incubated in digestion buffer containing RNase-free DNase I and the proteinase inhibitors for 1 h at 37 °C. Then 1 m ammonium sulfate was added to the sample to a final concentration of 0.25 m for 5 min on ice. After centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was used as a chromatin fraction. The pellet was further incubated with 2 m NaCl in digestion buffer for 10 min on ice and then centrifuged. The resulting pellet was solubilized in the urea buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 8 m urea, 100 mm sodium phosphate, and the proteinase inhibitors) and used as the nuclear matrix fraction. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). Phosphorylation Assay—Phosphorylation assay was performed as described (54Amano M. Chihara K. Kimura K. Fukata Y. Nakamura N. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1997; 275: 1308-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar) with some modifications. For the immunocomplex kinase assay, endogenous ROCK2 was immunoprecipitated with 2 μg of anti-ROCK2 antibody (H-85) or control IgG from 1 mg of the cytoplasmic or nucleoplasmic fraction of HeLa cells. After washing twice in NETN buffer and twice in 1× kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA), the immunoprecipitates were preincubated with or without 10 μm Y27632 for 10 min at room temperature. A kinase reaction was performed in the presence of 500 ng of GST-MBS-CT (C terminus of MBS) (53Kawano Y. Fukata Y. Oshiro N. Amano M. Nakamura T. Ito M. Matsumura F. Inagaki M. Kaibuchi K. J.

Reaction mixtures were resolved by SDS-PAGE, dried, and exposed to x-ray film. To test kinase activity of exogenously expressed CAT-nls, 293T cells were transiently transfected with expression vectors for Myc-tagged CAT-nls or empty vector (pCMV-Myc-nuc), and whole cell extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc antibody, followed by the kinase reaction as described above. Gel Filtration Chromatography—Gel filtration of HeLa nuclear extracts was performed using Superose 6, HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) as described (58Wu R.C. Qin J. Hashimoto Y. Wong J. Xu J.

Trichloroacetic acid protein precipitation was performed following fractionation, and the protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot with anti-ROCK2 (H-85) and -p300 (N-15) antibodies by reprobing the same membrane. Molecular weight was estimated using the molecular weight marker kit for gel chromatography (Sigma) as well as reprobing the membrane with other reference antibodies, including the N-CoR (1.5–2 MDa) (59Yoon H.G.

https://openalex.org/W2070236441,"The organization of pigment molecules in photosystems is strictly determined. The peripheral antennae have both chlorophyll a and b, but the core antennae consist of only chlorophyll a in green plants. Furthermore, according to the recent model obtained from the crystal structure of light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b-protein complexes II (LHCII), individual chlorophyll-binding sites are occupied by either chlorophyll a or chlorophyll b. In this study, we succeeded in altering these pigment organizations by introducing a prokaryotic chlorophyll b synthesis gene (chlorophyllide a oxygenase (CAO)) into Arabidopsis. In these transgenic plants (Prochlirothrix hollandica CAO plants), ∼40% of chlorophyll a of the core antenna complexes was replaced by chlorophyll b in both photosystems. Chlorophyll a/b ratios of LHCII also decreased from 1.3 to 0.8 in PhCAO plants. Surprisingly, these transgenic plants were capable of photosynthetic growth similar to wild type under low light conditions. These results indicate that chlorophyll organizations are not solely determined by the binding affinities, but they are also controlled by CAO. These data also suggest that strict organizations of chlorophyll molecules are not essential for photosynthesis under low light conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2141630918,"Stimulation of freshly isolated rat hepatocytes with lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) resulted in LPA1 receptor-mediated and nitricoxide-dependent up-regulation of the immediate early genes iNOS (inducible nitric-oxide synthase (NOS)) and mPGES-1 (microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1). Because LPA is a ligand for both cell surface and intracellular receptor sites and a potent endothelial NOS (eNOS) activator, we hypothesized that NO derived from activated nuclearized eNOS might participate in gene regulation. Herein we show, by confocal microscopy performed on porcine cerebral endothelial cells expressing native LPA1-receptor and eNOS and on HTC4 rat hepatoma cells co-transfected with recombinant human LPA1-receptor and fused eNOS-GFP cDNA, a dynamic eNOS translocation from peripheral to nuclear regions upon stimulation with LPA. Nuclear localization of eNOS and its downstream effector, soluble guanylate cyclase, were demonstrated in situ in rat liver specimens by immunogold labeling using specific antibodies. Stimulation of this nuclear fraction with LPA and the NO donor sodium nitroprusside resulted, respectively, in increased production of nitrite (and eNOS phosphorylation) and cGMP; these separate responses were also correspondingly blocked by NOS inhibitor l-NAME and soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitor ODQ. In addition, sodium nitroprusside evoked a sequential increase in nuclear Ca2+ transients, activation of p42 MAPK, NF-κB binding to DNA consensus sequence, and dependent iNOS RNA.

Moreover, our findings strongly support the concept of the nucleus as an autonomous signaling compartment. Nitric oxide (NO) is a short-lived uncharged free radical involved in numerous complex biological processes such as blood pressure regulation, vascular inflammation, cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and survival (1Moncada S.

However, NO can also interact with and modify the bioactivity of a number of protein macromolecules through a series of reversible and nonreversible chemical reactions (e.g. S-, N-, and hemenitrosylation, tyrosine and tryptophan nitration) providing multifaceted regulatory mechanisms for cellular functions (3Davis K.L.

FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1775-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). NO is synthesized from l-arginine by a tripartite family of nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) isozymes composed of NOS-1 (nNOS), NOS-2 (iNOS), and NOS-3 (eNOS) originally found in brain, macrophages, and endothelium, respectively, and later discovered, for each NOS, in many other cell types (5Förstermann U. Boissel J.P. Kleinert H. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 773-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). NOS isozymes, especially eNOS, are highly regulated by a number of mechanisms. Emerging findings show that eNOS bioactivity and mobilization to specific organelles are dictated by multiple post-translational modifications (e.g. phosphorylation, myristoylation, palmitoylation, S-nitrosylation) and numerous protein-protein interactions (e.g. Akt, caveolin, Hsp-90, calcium/calmodulin, NOSIP, NOSTRIN). These latter allosteric interactions, which impart either inhibitory or stimulatory effects on the eNOS enzyme, have been postulated to ensure specificity of eNOS signaling in different parts of the same cell (6Shaul P.W.

Because of the significant reactivity of NO and its limited diffusion, its cellular actions are likely triggered in the immediate vicinity of its site of synthesis (3Davis K.L. Martin E. Turko I.V.

However, the physiological consequences of eNOS routing to such distinct intracellular locales is poorly understood and rather speculative. In line with the presence of intracellular eNOS, we and others have recently disclosed the presence of functional G protein-coupled receptors at the nuclear/perinuclear envelope, including LPA/LPA1Rs (16Gobeil Jr., F. Bernier S.G. Vazquez-Tello A. Brault S. Beauchamp M.H. Quiniou C. Marrache A.M. Checchin D. Sennlaub F. Hou X. Nader M. Bkaily G. Ribeiro-da-Silva A. Goetzl E.J. Chemtob S. J. Biol.

However, whether natural eNOS is active at the nucleus and whether its products can stimulate nuclear functions have never been addressed. Because LPA is a G protein-coupled receptor agonist that exerts actions on the plasma membrane and separately on intracellular compartments via its cognate receptor, and because it is a recognized eNOS activator, it has been used to study NO-related responses in cells and in the nuclear organelles isolated from these cells (16Gobeil Jr., F.

Our initial experiments on freshly isolated rat hepatocytes stimulated with physiologically relevant concentrations of LPA demonstrated a conspicuous NO-dependent increase in inducible mPGES-1 (microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1) and iNOS gene expression. In the present study, we tested and confirmed the hypothesis that eNOS is distributed and active at the nucleus, and at this site it can promote (via G protein-coupled receptor-evoked mechanisms) NO-mediated signal transduction cascades within the nucleus to modulate gene expression.

Animals—Animal housing and experimental protocols were carried out in accordance with regulations set by the Canadian Council of Animal Care Committee and approved by local Animal Care Committee. Experiments were performed on hepatocytes isolated from the livers of adult Sprague-Dawley male rats (Charles River; St. Constant, Québec, Canada) as well as of eNOS–/– (20Shesely E.G. Maeda N.

For the latter, crude nuclear fractions were resuspended in buffer containing 1.2 m sucrose and layered on top of a buffer solution containing 1.8 m sucrose prior to centrifugation at 60 000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. Porcine cerebral microvascular endothelial cell (pCMVEC) fractionation and nuclear isolation were achieved by the hypotonic/Nonidet P-40 lysis method (17Gobeil Jr., F. Dumont I. Marrache A.M.

COS-1 cells were transfected with the cDNA for GFP-eNOS (kindly provided by Dr. J. P. Gratton, Institut de Recherches Cliniques de Montréal) using Lipofectamine as per the manufacturer's instructions. Gene Induction and Semiquantification of iNOS and mPGES-1 Transcripts—Hepatocytes were harvested following digestion of rat liver with collagenase (type II, 0.05% Sigma) as described previously (16Gobeil Jr., F.

Freshly isolated hepatocytes were left to stabilize for 1 h at 37 °C in stimulation buffer consisting of Hepes 20 mm, pH 7.4, dextrose 20 mm, KH2PO4 1.18 mm, MgSO4 1.18 mm, MgSO4, 1.18 mm, CaCl2, 2.5 mm, KCl 4.7 mm, and NaCl 118 mm. Hepatocyte suspensions were pretreated for 20 min with vehicle, nonselective NO synthase inhibitor l-NAME (1 mm), or LPA1R peptide antagonist THG1603 (100 μm) and then stimulated for 3 h with sLPA (10 μm). Cells were then centrifuged (600 × g, 5 min at 4 °C) and the resulting pellet snap-frozen for subsequent RNA extraction. Quiescent pCMVEC (90% confluency) cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium buffer and treated for 1 h at 37°C with either vehicle (bidistilled and deionized water) or s-LPA (10 μm). Cells were then washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), harvested in the same buffer by gentle scraping, and collected following centrifugation. Total RNA from purified hepatocytes and cultured pCMVEC were isolated by the standard guanidine isothiocyanate method and by using the RNeasy Protect Mini kit (Qiagen), respectively. Rat and porcine iNOS and β-actin mRNAs were quantified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method as described elsewhere (16Gobeil Jr., F. Bernier S.G. Vazquez-Tello A.

Those for pig mPGES-1 primers are: sense, 5′-ACC AGT ACA AGA CAT GTC CCT TC; antisense, 5′-CAC TTC ATC TCC TCC GTC CTG. For mPGES-1 cDNA amplification, the reaction was heated at 94 °C for 40 s, annealed at 58 °C for 40 s, and extended at 68 °C for 1 min 20 s for 30 repetitive cycles. iNOS gene expression was also studied in a cell-free nuclear system essentially as described (16Gobeil Jr., F.

In brief, highly purified rat and mouse liver nuclei (∼106 nuclei/assay) were preincubated at 37 °C for 15 min with l-NAME (1 mm) or THG1603 (100 μm) prior to stimulation with sLPA (10 μm) for 60 min. In another set of experiments, isolated rat liver nuclei were incubated at 37 °C for 60 min with either vehicle (buffer) or SNP (1 μm) in the presence or absence of ODQ (0.3 μm), KT5823 (1 μm), EGTA (100 μm), and PD98059 (1 μm) or NF-κB inhibitor PDTC (100 μm) (15 min preincubation). Total nuclear RNA was isolated as described (16Gobeil Jr., F. Bernier S.G. Vazquez-Tello A. Brault S. Beauchamp M.H. Quiniou C. Marrache A.M. Checchin D. Sennlaub F. Hou X. Nader M. Bkaily G.

PCR products were quantified using an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer in conjunction with DNA 7500 Labchip kits and by electrophoresis on precast 1% agarose gels stained with SYBR® Gold nucleic acid stain (Agilent Technologies). Gels were imaged and analyzed with a fluorescence gel imaging system (16Gobeil Jr., F. Bernier S.G. Vazquez-Tello A. Brault S. Beauchamp M.H. Quiniou C. Marrache A.M. Checchin D. Sennlaub F. Hou X.

For cross-linking experiments, freshly isolated rat hepatocytes (7 × 105 cells/assay) were incubated with the membrane-impermeable, water-soluble cross-linker reagent BS3 (1 mm) for 1 h at 37°C. Thereafter, 50 mm Tris-HCl was added to the incubation medium to stop the reaction as per the manufacturer's instruction (Pierce). Hepatic cells were then challenged with sLPA (10 μm). Reaction was terminated by freezing samples in liquid N2. Western blots of MAPK activation after sLPA (10 μm) exposure (0 to 30 min) and RT-PCR for iNOS gene induction (1 h) were then performed. For the former assay, prepared cytosolic proteins (50 μg) were resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 9% gel, transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes, and then probed with Erk1/2 and phospho-Erk(1/2) antibodies (diluted 1:1000). Autoradiograms were scanned and analyzed by densitometry (ImagePro 4+ software). RT-PCR Detection of LPA/LPA1R in COS-1 Cells—The presence of basal endogenous LPA/LPA1R (among others) in several host expression systems often used to study LPA signaling has recently been documented (24Chun J. Contos J.J.A. Munroe D. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 30: 213-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). We investigated whether COS-1 cells, used for functional experiments (see below), expressed endogenous LPA1R mRNA; LPA1R stably transfected HTC4 rat hepatoma cells were used as positive control (21An S. Bleu T. Zheng Y. Goetzl E.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 881-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). For this purpose, cells were cultured on 10-cm diameter Petri dishes to 80% confluency, and then total RNA was extracted using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini kit. Total RNA (2.5 μg) was reverse-transcribed using random hexamers, and the cDNA was amplified using specific primers designed from highly conserved regions of the LPA1R gene across species. The sequences of LPA1R primers are as follows: forward, 5′-ATC TWG CCA CAG AAT GGA ACA CAG T (where W = A or T), reverse, 5′-CAG ATR CAG TTC CAG CCC ACA CTG GG (where R = G or A). The reaction mixture was heated at 94 °C for 40 s, annealed at 58 °C for 45 s, and extended at 68 °C for 1 min 20 s for 35 repetitive cycles. Controls were carried out by omitting the reverse transcriptase in total RNA samples before the amplification reaction. Resulting PCR products were submitted to gel electrophoresis and detected as described above. The expected amplified cDNA fragment, corresponding to a 450 base-pair product, was observed in both COS-1 and LPA1R/HTC4 cells (not shown). Immunocytochemical and Confocal Microscopic Analysis of eNOS Trafficking—pCMVEC and COS-1 cells grown on coverslips (VWR Int.) to quasi-confluency were serum-starved overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium prior to beginning the experiments. Cells were incubated for various periods of time (0, 15, 30, and 60 min) with sLPA (10 μm). Control experiments, performed by Western blotting on total cell lysates, showed that the eNOS expression level in pCMVEC remained unchanged over the time frame of the experiments (see Fig. 3). After the incubation, cells were washed twice with cold PBS and then fixed with PBS plus 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. For eNOS immunofluorescence, pCMVECs were additionally blocked and permeabilized with PBS containing 5%"

Increased IRS-2 expression promotes β-cell growth and survival, whereas decreased IRS-2 levels lead to apoptosis. It was found that IRS-2 turnover in rat islet β-cells was rapid, with mRNA and protein half-lives of ∼90 min and ∼2 h, respectively. However, this was countered by specific glucose-regulated IRS-2 expression mediated at the transcriptional level. Glucose (≥6 mm) increased IRS-2 mRNA and protein levels in a dose-dependent manner, reaching a maximum 4-fold increase in IRS-2 mRNA and a 5–6-fold increase in IRS-2 protein levels at ≥12 mm glucose (p ≤ 0.01). Glucose (15 mm) regulation of islet β-cell IRS-2 gene expression was rapid, with a significant increase in IRS-2 mRNA levels within 2 h that reached a maximum 4-fold increase by 4 h. IRS-2 protein expression in β-cells followed that of IRS-2 mRNA. Glucose metabolism was necessary for increased IRS-2 expression in β-cells. Moreover, inhibition of a glucose-induced rise in islet β-cell cytosolic [Ca2+]i prevented an increase in IRS-2 expression, indicating this was Ca2+-dependent. The glucose-induced rise in IRS-2 levels correlated with increased IRS-2 tyrosine phosphorylation and downstream activation of protein kinase B. These data indicate that fluctuations of glucose in the normal physiological range (5–15 mm) promote β-cell survival via regulation of IRS-2 expression and a subsequent parallel protein kinase B activation. Given that the onset of type-2 diabetes is marked by loss of β-cells, these data further the idea that controlled IRS-2 expression in β-cells could be a therapeutic means to promote β-cell survival and delay the onset of the disease.

Pancreatic β-cells are the sole source of insulin production in adults, and regulated insulin secretion is a primary control of mammalian glucose homeostasis. It is now widely acknowledged that the onset of type-2 diabetes is not only due to insulin secretory dysfunction (1Porte Jr., D. Kahn S.E. Diabetes. 2001; 50: S160-S163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2LeRoith D. Am. J. Med. 2002; 113: 3S-11SAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but also significant loss of β-cell mass that no longer compensates for the metabolic load and/or acquired insulin resistance (3Rhodes C.J.

As such, there is current interest in molecular mechanisms that promote β-cell survival as a potential therapeutic means to delay the onset of diabetes.

Diabetes. 2002; 51: 966-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In insulin target tissues, particularly the liver, IRS-2 also plays a pivotal role in insulin signal transduction pathways that mediate the anabolic and metabolic effects of insulin (8White M.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: E413-E422Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). As such, in IRS-2–/– mice, there is inherent insulin resistance that cannot be balanced by a compensatory increase in β-cell mass (12Withers D.J. Burks D.J. Towery H.H. Altamuro S.L. Flint C.L. White M.F. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 32-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 13Withers D.J. Gutierres J.S. Towery H. Ren J.-M. Burks D.J. Previs S. Zhang Y. Bernal D. Pons S. Shulman G.I. Bonner-Weir S. White M.F. Nature. 1998; 391: 900-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar). Indeed, without IRS-2 expression, β-cells undergo spontaneous apoptosis, markedly reducing the net β-cell mass so that frank diabetes ensues in IRS-2–/– mice (12Withers D.J. Burks D.J. Towery H.H. Altamuro S.L. Flint C.L. White M.F. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 32-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). This is in marked contrast to IRS-1–/– mice, where the inherent insulin resistance is compensated by an increase in β-cell mass (13Withers D.J. Gutierres J.S. Towery H. Ren J.-M. Burks D.J. Previs S. Zhang Y. Bernal D. Pons S. Shulman G.I. Bonner-Weir S. White M.F. Nature. 1998; 391: 900-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar). This illustrates the crucial role that IRS-2 plays in maintaining adequate β-cell growth and survival. Indeed, genetically engineering an increase in IRS-2 expression specifically in β-cells is protective against β-cell apoptosis and can even prevent diabetes in vivo in experimental models (9Hennige A.M. Burks D.J. Ozcan U. Kulkarni R.N. Ye J. Park S. Schubert M. Fisher T.L. Dow M.A. Leshan R. Zakaria M. Mossa-Basha M. White M.F. J. Clin.

Thus, there is potential that a controlled specific expression of IRS-2 in β-cells can promote β-cell survival, maintain adequate β-cell mass, and delay the onset of diabetes. In this regard, it has been shown that GLP-1 analogs regulate IRS-2 expression in β-cells, which in turn could be a major contributory mechanism as to how GLP-1 promotes β-cell growth and survival (14Jhala U.S. Canettieri G.

Diabetologia. 2004; 47: 478-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). However, it is quite likely that other factors, independent of GLP-1, control IRS-2 expression in β-cells and consequently promote β-cell growth and survival. In this regard, glucose and certain other nutrients have been shown to promote β-cell growth and survival (17Hügl S.R. White M.F. Rhodes C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17771-17779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 18Wrede C.E. Dickson L.M. Lingohr M.K. Briaud I. McCuaig J.F. Rhodes C.J. J. Biol.

Diabetes. 1980; 29: 686-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). It should be noted, however, that this is pertinent to a relatively short term (<24 h) exposure limited to the physiologically relevant range of glucose concentrations (5–15 mm) (17Hügl S.R. White M.F. Rhodes C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17771-17779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). When β-cells are chronically exposed (>24 h) to higher glucose concentrations (>20 mm), apoptosis can be induced, a process often referred to as glucotoxicity (20Briaud I. Dickson L.M. Lingohr M.K.

Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 339-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). In this study, in rat primary islet β-cells, we have shown that IRS-2 can be specifically regulated by physiological glucose concentrations (5–15 mm) relatively rapidly (>2h) at the transcriptional level. This suggests a mechanism whereby the β-cell mass can effectively adapt to changes in the metabolic status via glucose-induced control of IRS-2 expression. Materials—The IRS-2 antibody was provided by Dr. M. White (Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA) or purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). The antibodies to the p85 subunit of PI3′K and to β-catenin were also from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., and the antibodies to total and phospho-Erk-1/2 were from Promega Corporation (Madison, WI). Phosphospecific antisera against phospho-Thr308 and phospho-Ser473 of PKB and an antibody to total PKB were from New England Biolabs, Inc. (Beverly, MA). [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Cell culture medium RPMI 1640, fetal calf serum, glutamine, and antibiotics were from Invitrogen. All other biochemicals were purchased from Sigma or Fisher. Animals—Wistar rats (150–200 g) were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). All animal care, use, and experiment protocols were submitted and approved by the Institutional Animal and Use Committee (IACUC) of Pacific Northwest Research Institute. Pancreatic Islet Isolation—Pancreatic islets were isolated from normal male Wistar rats by collagenase digestion and Histopaque density gradient centrifugation as previously described (22Alarcón C. Lincoln B. Rhodes C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4276-4280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After isolation, the islets were handpicked using a stereomicroscope and incubated for 16 h in RPMI 1640 without serum but containing 3 mm glucose, 0.1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, and 100 units/ml penicillin/100 mg/ml streptomycin. Cell Culture—The pancreatic β-cell line INS-1 (23Asfari M. Janjic D. Meda P. Guodong L. Halban P.A. Wollheim C.B.

Prior to experimental use, the INS-1 cells were incubated in RPMI 1640 without serum but containing 3 mm glucose, 0.1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, and 100 units/ml penicillin/100 mg/ml streptomycin for 16 h. Real-time Fluorescence-based Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from 120 isolated rat islets as described previously (25Wicksteed B.L. Alarcón C. Briaud I. Dickson L. Lingohr M.K.

One-step reverse RT-PCR was carried out using the Taqman™ PCR core reagent kit from Applied Biosystems and an ABI Prism 7700 sequence detector equipped with a thermocycler (Taqman Technology) and a cooled charge-coupled device camera to detect fluorescence emission over a range of wavelengths (500–650 nm), as described previously (27Hagman D.K.

Briefly, reverse transcription was first performed using specific oligonucleotides and the Multiscribe™ reverse transcriptase at 48 °C for 30 min. Samples were then PCR-amplified using GoldTaq™ polymerase and oligonucleotide primers for IRS-2, insulin, and β-actin (control for RNA quantity) as described below for 40 cycles under the following conditions: denaturation at 95 °C for 15 s, annealing, and extension at 60 °C for 1 min. Comparative analysis was based upon the cycle number at which a significant increase in the amplification signal above the base line was detected. Standard curves were constructed for each experiment with R values > 0.98. Primer and probe sequences (5′–3′) were as follows: IRS-2 probe, 6FAM-TGCTCACAATTCCAAGCGCCACAAT-TAMRA; IRS-2 forward primer, CCCCAGTGTCCCCATCCT; IRS-2 reverse primer, TTTCCTGAGAGAGACGTTTTCCA. Insulin probe, 6FAM-AGCTTCCACCAAGTGAGAACCACAAAGGT-TAMRA; Insulin forward primer, GCCCAGGCTTTTGTCAAACA; Insulin reverse primer, CTCCCCACACACCAGGTAGAG. β-actin probe, 6FAM-AGGCATCCTGACCCTGAAGTACCCCA-TAMRA; β-actin forward primer, ACGAGGCCCAGAGCAAGA; β-actin reverse primer, TTGGTTACAATGCCGTGTTCA. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from ∼4 × 106 INS-1 cells using an RNeasy mini-kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Between 5 and 10 μg of total RNA was loaded onto a formaldehyde gel (1% agarose) and subjected to electrophoresis. The RNA was transferred to a nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences) and hybridized to the IRS-2 or β-actin probe. The random primers labeling system purchased from Invitrogen was utilized to generate the following [32P]cDNA probes: a 0.4-kb NotI-HindIII fragment of mouse IRS-2 cDNA subcloned into pShuttleCMV and a 0.6-kb EcoRI fragment of β-actin cDNA subcloned into topo-pCR2.1. Hybridization of probes was conducted at 65 °C for 2–4 h. Membranes were exposed for autoradiography at –70 °C using film (Amersham Biosciences). IRS-2 mRNA (7 kb) and β-actin mRNA (1.1 kb) were visualized in 1–7 days. IRS-2 mRNA was quantified with Optiquant image software (n ≥ 3). Immunoblot Analysis—Either 100 isolated rat islets or 1 × 106 INS-1 cells per observation were incubated in RPMI 1640 medium without serum at various glucose concentrations (3–15 mm) for times between 0.5 and 24 h at 37 °C as indicated. Thereafter, the islets or cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and placed in a lysis buffer containing, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm sodium vanadate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 4 mm EDTA, 10 μm leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cell lysates were generated by sonication (25 watts for 10 s) on ice and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min to remove insoluble material and then normalized for equivalent total protein content. Immunoblot analysis on cell lysates was then performed as previously described (18Wrede C.E. Dickson L.M. Lingohr M.K. Briaud I. McCuaig J.F. Rhodes C.J. J. Biol.

Co-immunoprecipitation Analysis—INS-1 cells (grown on 20-cm plates) were preincubated at basal 3 mm glucose and then at a stimulatory 15 mm glucose for between 0 and 8 h. The cells were then lysed in lysis buffer and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was collected and protein content between samples normalized to contain 5 mg of total protein/ml. The samples were then subjected to immunoprecipitation with an antibody against IRS-2 and immune complexes resolved by SDS-PAGE as described previously (10Lingohr M.K. Dickson L.M. Wrede C.E.

The extent of IRS-2 tyrosine phosphorylation and association of PI3′K(p85) was determined by subsequent immunoblot analyses as described previously (10Lingohr M.K. Dickson L.M. Wrede C.E. Briaud I.

Immunofluorescent Analysis—INS-1 cells were subcultured on glass coverslips within 6-well plates to 60–70% confluence and, after incubation at basal 3 mm glucose or stimulatory 15 mm glucose as indicated, were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, fixed to coverslips with 4% paraformaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline, rehydrated, and then rewashed with phosphate-buffered saline. The immunofluorescence analysis was conducted as previously described (29Lingohr M.K. Dickson L.M. Wrede C. McCuaig J.F. Myers Jr., M.G. Rhodes C.J. Mol. Cell.

Where appropriate, data are presented as means ± S.E. Statistically significant differences between groups were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance, where p < 0.05 was considered a statistically significant difference. IRS-2 mRNA and Protein Have a Rapid Turnover in Rat Pancreatic Islet β-Cells, Independent of the Glucose Concentration—The half-life (T1/2) of IRS-2 mRNA was determined in isolated rat islets and INS-1 cells. Essentially, islets or INS-1 cells were incubated in the presence of the transcriptional blocker actinomycin-D (1 μg/ml) at either basal 3 mm or stimulatory 15 mm glucose for up to 8 h at 37°C, and then IRS-2, β-actin, and preproinsulin mRNA levels were assessed at different time points by quantitative RT-PCR (in isolated islet samples because of the limited amount of tissue available) (Fig. 1A) or Northern blot analysis (in INS-1 cells) (Fig. 1B) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The IRS-2 mRNA levels decayed much more rapidly in islets (Fig. 1A) and INS-1 cells (Fig. 1B) relative to that for β-actin and preproinsulin. The estimated T1/2 value for IRS-2 mRNA in islets at basal 3 mm glucose was 85.6 ± 7.8 min (n = 6) and at stimulatory 15 mm glucose 92.1 ± 7.3 min (n = 6). Similar T1/2 values for IRS-2 mRNA were found in INS-cells of 82.5 ± 10.1 min (n = 3) at 3 mm glucose and 84.9 ± 9.6 min (n = 4) at 15 mm glucose. Comparable T1/2 IRS-2 mRNA values in INS-1 cells and isolated rat islets indicate that these estimations were pertinent to primary pancreatic β-cells. There appeared to be no significant effect of glucose on the stability of IRS-2 mRNA in β-cells under these conditions (Figs. 1). Because there was ≥50% residual β-actin and preproinsulin mRNA after 8 h in islet β-cells in the presence of actinomycin-D (Fig. 1), the T1/2 values of these mRNAs in β-cells could not be accurately estimated other than to state that they were >8 h. There was no obvious effect of glucose on β-actin mRNA stability (Fig. 1), but preproinsulin mRNA tended to stabilize at stimulatory 15 mm glucose compared with that at basal 3 mm glucose (Fig. 1A) in agreement with previous observations in β-cell lines (30Welsh M. Nielsen D.A. MacKrell A.J. Steiner D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13590-13594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The T1/2 values of IRS-2 protein were also evaluated in rat islets and INS-1 cells incubated at basal 3 mm or stimulatory 15 mm glucose in the presence of either the transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin-D (1 μg/ml; Fig. 2, A and B) or the translational inhibitor cycloheximide (10 μg/ml; Fig. 2, C and D) over an 8-h incubation period at 37 °C. IRS-2 protein levels were assessed by immunoblot analysis at different time points. As for IRS-2 mRNA (Fig. 1), IRS-2 protein levels decayed relatively rapidly in islet β-cells compared with that for IRS-1, PI3′K(p85), PKB, or Erk-1/2 (Fig. 2, A and C). The estimated T1/2 for IRS-2 protein in the presence of actinomycin-D in islets at basal 3 mm glucose was 132.4 ± 12.8 min (n = 6) and at stimulatory 15 mm glucose 122.8 ± 11.1 min (n = 6) (Fig. 2B). Similar T1/2 values for IRS-2 protein in rat islets were observed in the presence of cycloheximide 137.9 ± 11.6 min (n = 5) at 3 mm basal glucose and 128.3 ± 10.2 min (n = 5) at stimulatory 15 mm glucose (Fig. 2, C and D). As for IRS-2 mRNA, there appeared to be no significant effect of glucose on the stability of IRS-2 protein in rat islets. In comparison to other rat islet β-cell signaling proteins, IRS-2 protein was relatively unstable, with IRS-1, PI3′K(p85), PKB, and Erk-1/2 having protein half-lives in excess of 8 h (Fig. 2). Similar results for IRS-2 protein T1/2 was found in INS-1 cells (data not shown), indicating that the T1/2 estimations for IRS-2 protein were pertinent to primary β-cells of rat islets. Glucose Specifically Increased IRS-2 Expression Levels in Rat Pancreatic Islet β-Cells—Isolated rat islets or INS-1 cells were incubated for 6 h across the physiologically relevant range of glucose concentrations (3–15 mm), and then examined for IRS-2 mRNA and protein expression levels. Above a threshold of 6 mm glucose, IRS-2 mRNA (Fig. 3A) and protein levels (Fig. 3B) were significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner above that of basal 3 mm glucose in isolated rat islets. A maximum IRS-2 expression level was reached at 12 mm glucose for IRS-2 mRNA (3.8 ± 0.4-fold, n = 5; p ≤ 0.05) (Fig. 3A) and IRS-2 protein (5.4 ± 0.6-fold, n = 6; p ≤ 0.05) (Fig. 3B). Similar findings for glucose-induced IRS-2 mRNA and protein expression was found in INS-1 cells (Fig. 3, C and D, respectively), indicating that this occurred in the β-cells of rat primary islets. There was no effect of glucose on control β-actin mRNA (Fig. 3, A and C) or PI3′K(p85) protein (Fig. 3, B and D), indicating that this was a relatively selective effect of glucose on IRS-2 expression. Glucose Rapidly Increased IRS-2 Expression Levels in Rat Pancreatic Islet β-Cells—Isolated rat islets or INS-1 cells were also incubated at stimulatory 15 mm glucose over a time course between 0 and 24 h. At 1 h, there was a significant increase in IRS-2 mRNA expression in rat islets compared with “time 0” (p < 0.05) (Fig. 4A) that, by 4 h, had reached a maximal 3.7 ± 0.5-fold (n = 5; p ≤ 0.05) increase, which was mostly sustained up to 24 h. Perhaps not surprisingly, the time course of glucose-induced IRS-2 protein expression lagged behind that of IRS-2 mRNA levels (Fig. 4, B versus A). Significant glucose-induced increases in IRS-2 protein levels in rat islets were found at 2 h, reaching a maximal 5.3 ± 0.6-fold (n = 6; p ≤ 0.05) increase by 8 h, which was relatively sustained up to 24 h (Fig. 4B). A similar rapid increase in glucose-induced IRS-2 mRNA expression (Fig. 4C) and protein levels (Fig. 4D) were observed in INS-1 cells, although this tended to tail off at 24 h. Nonetheless, this reaffirmed that the rapid glucose-induced increase in IRS-2 expression occurred in the primary β-cells of rat islets. Glucose-induced Control of IRS-2 Expression in Rat Islet β-Cells Was Predominately Mediated at the Transcriptional Level—The data presented so far indicate that IRS-2 mRNA and protein levels are regulated by glucose in parallel (Figs. 3 and 4). Moreover, there appears to be no effect of glucose on IRS-2 mRNA or protein stability (Figs. 1 and 2). In using titration of certain inhibitors of protein synthesis translation, no effect of glucose-induced translational control of IRS-2 expression in rat islets could be observed (data not shown). However, the inhibitor of gene transcription, actinomycin-D (1 μg/ml), completely prevented the glucose-induced increase in IRS-2 mRNA (p ≤ 0.01; Fig. 5A) and IRS-2 protein (p ≤ 0.01; Fig. 5B) expression levels in isolated rat islets over a 6-h incubation period. Collectively, these data indicate that glucose regulation of IRS-2 expression, over the relative short term (<8 h) and physiological glucose concentration range (3–15 mm), in primary islet β-cells was predominately mediated at the transcriptional level. Glucose-induced Control of IRS-2 Expression in Rat Islet β-Cells Required Glucose Metabolism and Was Not Mediated by Secreted Insulin—A stimulatory concentration of the non-metabolizable analog of glucose, 2-deoxyglucose (15 mm), unlike glucose itself, was unable to promote a significant increase in islet IRS-2 mRNA or protein levels (Fig. 5, C and D, respectively). This was indicative that glucose metabolism was necessary for glucose-induced IRS-2 expression in islet β-cells. It was possible that the glucose-induced increase of β-cell IRS-2 expression was mediated by a positive feedback of secreted insulin on the β-cell (31Leibiger I.B. Leibiger B. Berggren P.O. FEBS Lett. 2002; 532: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, although glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was blocked ≥90% by the addition of somatostatin (data not shown) (25Wicksteed B.L. Alarcón C. Briaud I. Dickson L. Lingohr M.K. Rhodes C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42080-42090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), a significant glucose-induced increase in IRS-2 mRNA and protein expression was apparent (p ≤ 0.05) (Fig. 5, E and F, respectively). Thus, glucose-stimulated IRS-2 expression in islet β-cells was not mediated via secreted insulin. Glucose-regulated IRS-2 Expression in Rat Islet β-Cells Is Ca2+-dependent—Investigation as to which particular secondary signals might evoke an increase in IRS-2 expression in islet β-cells downstream of glucose metabolism was conducted. Some effects of glucose on islet β-cells are mediated via a transient increase in [cAMP]i and protein kinase A (PKA) activation (28Briaud I. Lingohr M.K. Dickson L. Wrede C. Rhodes C.J. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 974-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 32Landa Jr., L.R. Harbeck M. Kaihara K. Chepurny O. Kitiphongspattana K. Graf O. Nikolaev V.O. Lohse M.J. Holz G.G. Roe M.W. J.

However, the PKA inhibitors H-89 (10 μm) and KT5720 (1 μm) only decreased a glucose-induced increase in IRS-2 mRNA expression in rat islets by 25.0 ± 3.6 and 22.8 ± 3.1%, respectively (n = 5), which was not statistically significant compared with the controls (Fig. 6A). Likewise, H-89 (10 μm) and KT5720 (1 μm) only lessened the glucose-induced increase in rat islet IRS-2 protein expre"
https://openalex.org/W2036407890,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) is a transcriptional coactivator involved in several aspects of energy metabolism. It is induced or activated under different stimuli in a highly tissue-specific manner and subsequently partners with certain transcription factors in those tissues to execute various biological programs. In the fasted liver, PGC-1α is induced and interacts with hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α) and other transcription factors to activate gluconeogenesis and increase hepatic glucose output. Given the broad spectrum of liver genes responsive to HNF4α, we sought to determine those that were specifically targeted by the combination of PGC-1α and HNF4α. Coexpression of these two molecules in murine stem cells reveals a high induction of mRNA for apolipoproteins A-IV and C-II. Forced expression of PGC-1α in mouse and human hepatoma cells increases the mRNA of a subset of apolipoproteins implicated in very low density lipoprotein and triglyceride metabolism, including apolipoproteins A-IV, C-II, and C-III. Coactivation of the apoC-III/A-IV promoter region by PGC-1α occurs through a highly conserved HNF4α response element, the loss of which completely abolishes activation by PGC-1α and HNF4α. Adenoviral infusion of PGC-1α into live mice increases hepatic expression of apolipoproteins A-IV, C-II, and C-III and increases serum and very low density lipoprotein triglyceride levels. Conversely, knock down of PGC-1α in vivo causes a decrease in both apolipoprotein expression and serum triglyceride levels.

It regulates both catabolic and anabolic processes that maintain proper blood levels of protein, carbohydrate, and lipid. The liver responds to blood-borne hormones and neurotransmitters, executing biological programs to ensure that the energy demands of peripheral tissues are satisfied. Many of these programs exert metabolic changes through the activation or induction of specific transcription factors, which in turn increase the expression of key enzymes or other downstream regulators.The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) 4The abbreviations used are: PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; PGC-1α, PPARγ coactivator-1 α; HNF4α, hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 α; VLDL, very low density lipoprotein; RNAi, RNA interference; GFP, green fluorescent protein; DR-1, direct repeat separated by one nucleotide. 4The abbreviations used are: PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; PGC-1α, PPARγ coactivator-1 α; HNF4α, hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 α; VLDL, very low density lipoprotein; RNAi, RNA interference; GFP, green fluorescent protein; DR-1, direct repeat separated by one nucleotide. coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) (1Puigserver P.

It also partners with liver X receptor α and farnesoid X receptor in modulating cholesterol and triglyceride metabolism (6Zhang Y. Castellani L.W. Sinal C.J. Gonzalez F.J. Edwards P.A.

In the hepatic response to fasting, PGC-1α coordinates the induction of genes involved in gluconeogenesis, fatty acid oxidation, and ketogenesis (8Rhee J. Inoue Y. Yoon J.C. Puigserver P. Fan M.

Its coactivation of the liver-enriched transcription factors HNF4α and FOXO1, as well as the glucocorticoid receptor, results in the induction of gluconeogenic enzymes and increased hepatic glucose output (10Yoon J.C. Puigserver P. Chen G. Donovan J. Wu Z. Rhee J. Adelmant G. Stafford J. Kahn C.R. Granner D.K. Newgard C.B. Spiegelman B.M.

The functional loss or genetic knock out of either HNF4α or FOXO1 completely abrogates the ability of PGC-1α to activate hepatic gluconeogenesis. PGC-1α interacts tightly with HNF4α in vitro and strongly coactivates this transcription factor on the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glucose-6-phosphatase promoters (8Rhee J. Inoue Y.

Ectopic expression of HNF4α in de-differentiated hepatoma cells or fibroblasts induces both a morphology and genetic markers characteristic of hepatic epithelium (14Spath G.F. Weiss M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 935-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 15Parviz F. Matullo C. Garrison W.D. Savatski L. Adamson J.W. Ning G. Kaestner K.H. Rossi J.M. Zaret K.S. Duncan S.A. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 292-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Although the total knock out of HNF4α is embryonic lethal due to defects in gastrulation (16Chen W.S. Manova K. Weinstein D.C. Duncan S.A. Plump A.S. Prezioso V.R. Bachvarova R.F. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2466-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar), embryos lacking HNF4α can be rescued in midgestation through tetraploid complementation (17Duncan S.A. Nagy A. Chan W. Development. 1997; 124: 279-287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of E12.0 fetuses null for HNF4α shows that a lack of HNF4α impairs differentiation into a fully functional hepatic parenchyma that expresses its normal complement of serum and metabolic factors, such as apolipoproteins and fatty acid-binding proteins (18Li J. Ning G. Duncan S.A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 464-474PubMed Google Scholar). Conditional knock out of the gene in the liver through a tissue-specific cre-lox system produces viable offspring that suffer from severe defects in lipid homeostasis; they accumulate lipid in the liver and exhibit reduced serum triglyceride levels (19Hayhurst G.P. Lee Y.H. Lambert G. Ward J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1393-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). It is clear that the transcriptional targets of HNF4α are numerous and varied. In fact, using chromatin immunoprecipitation in human hepatocytes combined with promoter microarrays, HNF4α localizes to 12% of 13,000 promoters examined (20Odom D.T. Zizlsperger N. Gordon D.B. Bell G.W. Rinaldi N.J. Murray H.L. Volkert T.L. Schreiber J. Rolfe P.A. Gifford D.K. Fraenkel E. Bell G.I. Young R.A. Science. 2004; 303: 1378-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar).Given the important functional interaction of PGC-1α with HNF4α and the broad roles of these two molecules in hepatic function, it is quite likely that their partnership influences multiple aspects of liver metabolism beyond that which has been described. Through microarray analysis, we now identify a subset of apolipoproteins as transcriptional targets that are particularly dependent on the cooperative action of PGC-1α and HNF4α. Adenoviral infusion of PGC-1α into live mice results in the hepatic induction of these apolipoproteins and a concomitant increase in serum and VLDL triglyceride. Knock down of PGC-1α via adenoviral RNAi decreases apolipoprotein mRNA and serum triglyceride levels. These data indicate that the PGC-1α/HNF4α partnership plays a critical role in hepatic lipoprotein synthesis and export.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMicroarray Analysis—Affymetrix array hybridization and scanning were performed by the Core Facility at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute using Murine 430 2.0 chips. Array data were analyzed with d-CHIP software.RNA Isolation and Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from liver or cultured cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For quantitative real-time PCR analysis, 2μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and random hexamer primers (Roche Applied Science). Relative mRNA abundance normalized to 18 S rRNA levels was determined with the ΔΔCt method after amplification using an iCycler iQ real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad) and SYBR Green (Bio-Rad). For Northern hybridizations, 20 μg of each sample of RNA was resolved on a formaldehyde gel, transferred to nylon membrane using a TurboBlotter (Schleicher & Schuell), and hybridized with 32P-labeled gene-specific probes. Hybridization to ribosomal protein 36B4 was included as a loading control.Animal Experiments—All animal experiments were performed according to procedures approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Animals were fed standard rodent chow and housed in a controlled environment with 12-h light and dark cycles. Fasts were started at the beginning of a dark cycle, and mice were deprived of food for the indicated amount of time before being sacrificed.Adenoviral Infection—Adenoviral GFP and PGC-1α have been described previously (54Lehman J.J. Barger P.M. Kovacs A. Saffitz J.E. Medeiros D.M. Kelly D.P. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 847-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar). An adenoviral vector encoding HNF4α was generated by cloning an HNF4α cDNA into AdTrack-CMV (Invitrogen). Cultured cells were infected with the indicated adenovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 50 at 90% confluence. 36 h after infection, cells were harvested and their RNA isolated. Female, 8-week-old C57 BL/6 mice were transduced with CsCl-purified adenovirus via tail vein injection. Mice were each tail vein injected with 0.2 OD of adenovirus (∼2 × 1011 viral particles/mouse). Four days later, they were subjected to a 24-h fast. The mice were sacrificed on the fifth day and their livers and plasma harvested.Cell Culture, Transfections, and Reporter Gene Assays—F9 teratocarcinoma cells were cultured on gelatinized plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. H2.35 mouse hepatoma cells were kept in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 4% fetal bovine serum and 1 μm dexamethasone. HepG2 cells were cultured in 10% fetal bovine serum in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Cells were transfected in 6-well dishes at 70% confluence using Superfect (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Each transfection involved a 1:1:10 ratio of reporter gene:transcription factor(s):coactivator for a total of 3.6 μg of DNA. Equal amounts of DNA were used for all transfection combinations by using appropriate vector DNA. For reporter gene assays, cells were harvested 24 h after transfection. Luciferase levels were determined and normalized to β-galactosidase expression. All transfection experiments were repeated at least three times in triplicate.Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis of the apoC-III/A-IV luciferase reporter (28Carrier J.C. Deblois G. Champigny C. Levy E. Giguere V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52052-52058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) was performed using overlapping primers and the Expand Long Template PCR system (Roche Applied Science). HNF4α-binding Site 1 was mutated from 5′-TGGGCAAAGGTCA-3′ to 5′-TGGGCAAtGcgCA-3′, which introduced an FspI site. Site 2 was mutated from 5′-TGGACCTTGTTCT-3′ to 5′-TGGACCTTcTaga-3′, which introduced an XbaI site.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—Experiments were performed using a chromatin immunoprecipitation kit (EZ ChIP) following the manufacturer's protocol (Upstate Biotechnology). H2.35 cells were transfected in 15-cm plates at 70% confluence with plasmids expressing GFP, FLAG-tagged PGC-1α, or FLAG-tagged PGC-1α plus HNF4α. Two days later cells were harvested, DNA-protein complexes cross-linked in formaldehyde, and immunoprecipitation reactions performed using M2 anti-FLAG resin (Sigma). After reverse cross-linking, DNA was purified by spin columns and subsequently analyzed by PCR.Triglyceride Measurements and Lipoprotein Fractionation—Total serum triglyceride was measured using a colorimetric assay kit (337; Sigma). For fractionation experiments, serum was diluted 1:1 (v/v) with phosphate-buffered saline and centrifuged to remove any debris. 100 μl of diluted sample was injected into a Superose 6 HR 10/30 gel filtration column for analysis of plasma lipoproteins, performed using a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Pharmacia ÄKTA) at 4 °C (55Ha Y.C. Barter P.J. J. Chromatogr. 1985; 341: 154-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Samples were eluted at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min in buffer containing 0.05 m phosphate and 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.0. Fractions of 0.3 ml were collected for analysis. Triglyceride levels in each fraction were measured enzymatically using an Infinity Triglyceride (GPO-Trinder) kit (Sigma).RESULTSCombined Expression of PGC-1α and HNF4α Induces Apolipoproteins in Cultured Cells—To determine the genes that are dependent upon cooperation between PGC-1α and HNF4α, we exogenously expressed these two molecules in F9 teratocarcinoma stem cells using adenoviral vectors. These cells have the ability to produce all three germ layers and have been used heavily as a model system for differentiation (21Alonso A. Breuer B. Steuer B. Fischer J. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1991; 35: 389-397PubMed Google Scholar). Table 1 is a partial list of the genes most highly induced by the combined ectopic expression of PGC-1α and HNF4α as determined by microarray analysis. Apolipoproteins C-II and A-IV are highly induced by the combination of HNF4α and PGC-1α, whereas either molecule alone does not induce them to nearly the same extent. Other apolipoproteins detected by the microarray are not significantly increased by these two molecules (supplemental Table S1).TABLE 1Highest scoring targets of AdPGC1α + AdHNF4α co-expressionFold expression over GFPGFP alonePGC-1α aloneHNF4α alonePGC-1α + HNF4αApolipoprotein C-II1118.51810.56 Aminoacylase 1131.2182.36674.17 RIKEN cDNA 4932432N11 gene136.61270.45 Purinergic receptor P2X, ligand-gated ion channel, 311201.21229.43Apolipoprotein A-IV111156.09 Retinol dehydrogenase 7112.35118.08 C-type lectin-related f14.022.11105.13 PGC-1α143.08NA94.08 G0/G1 switch gene 21NA5.8571.01 HNF4α14.7567.170.52 Open table in a new tab To confirm the results of the microarray analysis, we analyzed the RNA from the F9 cells with quantitative PCR. As shown in Fig. 1, apoC-II and apoA-IV are highly induced by PGC-1α and HNF4α, much more so than by either protein alone. Interestingly, apoA-I and apoC-III are also significantly induced by PGC-1α and HNF4α in this context, despite their relatively low expression in the arrays. HNF4α activates the apoB promoter (22Metzger S. Halaas J.L. Breslow J.L. Sladek F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16831-16838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and although there is a 20-fold induction of apoB by HNF4α alone, PGC-1α only further augments this by a modest 2-fold. The expression of apoE, another target of HNF4α (23Dang Q. Walker D. Taylor S. Allan C. Chin P. Fan J. Taylor J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22577-22585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), is not increased in the presence of ectopic PGC-1α and HNF4α. Likewise, although the epithelial marker E-cadherin is expressed in response to forced HNF4α expression in fibroblasts (14Spath G.F. Weiss M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 935-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), it fails to be activated in these cells by the co-expression of PGC-1α and HNF4α. In summary, PGC-1α robustly coactivates a subset, but not all, of the downstream targets of HNF4α.Apolipoprotein biosynthesis is most abundant in the liver in vivo. To examine the effects of PGC-1α and HNF4α in cells derived from liver, we exogenously expressed the two molecules in H2.35 mouse hepatoma cells through adenoviral transduction and subsequently harvested RNA. Northern analysis in Fig. 2A shows that the mRNAs for apolipoproteins A-IV, C-II, and C-III are induced to detectable levels only in the presence of both PGC-1α and HNF4α. ApoA-IV and apoC-II are expressed 11-fold over their levels with HNF4α alone, whereas apoC-III is increased 14-fold as measured by quantitative PCR (supplemental Table S2). Unlike its effect in F9 cells, ectopic HNF4α in H2.35 cells is, alone, sufficient to increase apoE levels. However, the addition of PGC-1α does not significantly enhance this induction. Likewise, HNF4α alone is able to induce apoB by 18-fold, and PGC-1α does not further increase its levels (supplemental Table S2). PGC-1β, a closely related homolog of PGC-1α that has been shown to regulate hepatic lipid synthesis and export (24Lin J. Yang R. Tarr P.T. Wu P.H. Handschin C. Li S. Yang W. Pei L. Uldry M. Tontonoz P. Newgard C.B. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 2005; 120: 261-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar), fails to induce these same genes. This is most likely due, at least in part, to the fact that PGC-1β coactivates HNF4α poorly (25Lin J. Tarr P.T. Yang R. Rhee J. Puigserver P. Newgard C.B. Spiegelman B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30843-30848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar).FIGURE 2The ectopic combination of PGC-1α and HNF4α induces apolipoproteins in hepatoma cells. A, H2.35 mouse hepatoma cells were infected with the indicated adenoviruses, and their RNA was analyzed by Northern blotting with radiolabeled mouse cDNA probes. 36B4 was blotted as a loading control. B, HepG2 human hepatoma cells were infected with the indicated adenoviruses, and their RNA was analyzed by Northern blotting with radiolabeled human cDNA probes. 36B4 was blotted as a loading control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine whether PGC-1α-mediated induction of apolipoproteins occurs within human cells as well as those from mouse, we expressed PGC-1α in HepG2 hepatoma cells. As in the H2.35 cells, PGC-1α is able to induce the same subset of apolipoproteins (Fig. 2B). However, in contrast to its expression in H2.35 cells, ectopic PGC-1α in HepG2 cells is alone sufficient to activate expression of these genes. In fact, adenoviral PGC-1α is much more effective in inducing these genes than is adenoviral HNF4α. For example, the level of apoA-IV is more than 30 times higher in the setting of adenoviral PGC-1α than in the presence of adenoviral HNF4α (supplemental Table S3). This is likely the result of a high endogenous level of HNF4α (Fig. 2B) through which the exogenously expressed PGC-1α may act.PGC-1α Coactivates HNF4α on the apoC-III/A-IV Promoter—The apoA-IV and apoC-III genes are separated in the mouse and human genomes by an ∼6-kb intergenic region (26Omori K. Vergnes L. Zakin M.M. Ochoa A. Gene. 1995; 159: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Because apoA-IV and apoC-III are transcribed in opposite directions, this intergenic region serves as a common 5′-flanking sequence for both genes (27Vergnes L. Taniguchi T. Omori K. Zakin M.M. Ochoa A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 299-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To test whether this region is responsive to PGC-1α coactivation of HNF4α, we transfected plasmids encoding these two factors along with an apoC-III/A-IV promoter luciferase construct into H2.35 hepatoma cells. Recent studies in intestinal epithelial cells report that PGC-1α coactivates estrogen-related receptor α on this promoter construct (28Carrier J.C. Deblois G. Champigny C. Levy E. Giguere V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52052-52058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Fig. 3A shows that PGC-1α robustly coactivates HNF4α on this reporter to nearly 400-fold over base line. No significant activation occurs when PGC-1α is co-expressed with other liver transcription factors, including a constitutively active allele of FOXO1, glucocorticoid receptor (GR), PPARα, and PPARγ (Fig. 3A). Previous reports have shown that PGC-1α coactivates these factors in other contexts (1Puigserver P. Wu Z. Park C.W. Graves R. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M.

A, H2.35 cells were transfected with an apoC-III/A-IV luciferase reporter and plasmids encoding the transcription factors estrogen-related receptor α (ERRα), FOXO1, GR, HNF4α, PPARα, or PPARγ. Reporter activity was measured for each of these transcription factors in the absence and presence of PGC-1α and depicted as –fold change over the first lane (vector alone). Transfections were repeated at least three times in triplicate. B, a diagram of the apoC-III/A-IV intergenic region. The full-length mouse promoter is 6 kb long, and two previously identified HNF4α response elements are depicted. Conservation of these sites between human and mouse genomes is also shown. C, H2.35 cells were transfected with plasmids expressing GFP, FLAG epitope-tagged PGC-1α, or a combination of HNF4α and tagged PGC-1α. Following formaldehyde cross-linking, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed using anti-FLAG resin. Co-immunoprecipitated DNA and 5% of input DNA were used as template for PCR primers flanking site 1, site 2, and a control region on chromosome 9 downstream of the apoA-IV gene. All PCR reactions were carried out to 23 cycles. D, H2.35 cells were transfected with PGC-1α, HNF4α, and either a wild-type or mutant apoC-III/A-IV luciferase reporter. HNF4α-binding sites 1 and 2 were mutated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” PGC-1α coactivation of HNF4α was measured on each of the different reporters and depicted as –fold change over the first lane (PGC-1α alone). Transfections were repeated at least three times in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We next identified the HNF4α response elements through which PGC-1α exerts its effects. Fig. 3B shows two previously characterized HNF4α-binding sites, labeled sites 1 and 2, located in the proximal promoters of apoC-III and apoA-IV, respectively (30Lavrentiadou S.N. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Kardassis D. Zannis V.I. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 964-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 31Ktistaki E. Lacorte J.M. Katrakili N. Zannis V.I. Talianidis I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4689-4696Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). These two direct repeats (DR-1) were also identified by NUBIScan, a computer algorithm that predicts DNA recognition sites for nuclear receptors (32Podvinec M. Kaufmann M.R. Handschin C. Meyer U.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1269-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Site 1 is a DR-1 that is 100% conserved between mouse and human. Chromatin immunoprecipitations were performed with antibodies against FLAG epitope-tagged PGC-1α, expressed alone or with HNF4α in H2.35 hepatoma cells. Only the immunoprecipitates containing cross-linked complexes of PGC-1α and HNF4α with genomic DNA are enriched with fragments encompassing site 1 and site 2, indicating that PGC-1α is recruited to both of these sites through HNF4α (Fig. 3C). Primers that amplify a control region on chromosome 9 downstream from the apoC-III/apoA-IV gene cluster show no PGC-1α-specific enrichment.To test the functional significance of these two putative HNF4α-response elements, we disrupted one of the two half-sites within each DR-1 through site-directed mutagenesis. Whereas mutation of site 2 leaves PGC-1α coactivation completely intact, mutation of site 1 utterly abolishes the PGC-1α effect (Fig. 3D). The absolute loss of response to PGC-1α when site 1 is mutated is observed in both the full-length reporter as well as in a truncated version containing 700 bp of apoC-III proximal promoter (data not shown). Taken together, these data show that PGC-1α directly coactivates HNF4α on the apolipoprotein C-III/A-IV intergenic region through an HNF4α-responsive element.Apolipoproteins A-IV and C-II Are Induced in Fasted Liver—We next investigated the physiological significance of PGC-1α-mediated induction of apolipoproteins. Because PGC-1α is an integral part of the hepatic fasting response, we looked at the expression of apolipoproteins in fasted mice. Previous reports demonstrate mild increases in apoA-I during fasting and more robust increases in apoA-IV (33LeBoeuf R.C. Caldwell M. Kirk E. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 121-133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Northern blotting in Fig. 4 shows that the genes for PGC-1α and apolipoproteins A-IV and C-II are indeed induced under 6- and 24-h food deprivation. Whereas apoC-II is increased roughly 2-fold at the 24-h time point, apoA-IV is induced over 70-fold as assessed by quantitative PCR (supplemental Fig. S1). ApoA-IV has been closely linked to triglyceride metabolism, and apoC-II is a requisite cofactor for lipoprotein lipase activity and uptake of free fatty acids into extrahepatic tissues. Given the importance of apolipoproteins in lipid metabolism and their regulation by PGC-1α in vitro, we next investigated the role of PGC-1α in the regulation of triglyceride levels in vivo.FIGURE 4Fasting induces hepatic mRNA for PGC-1α, apoA-IV, and apoC-II. Mice were fasted for 6 and 24 h and sacrificed or refed for another 24 h and then sacrificed.

https://openalex.org/W1996563680,"The RhoA GTPase controls a variety of cell functions such as cell motility, cell growth, and gene expression. Previous studies suggested that RhoA mediates signaling inputs that promote skeletal myogenic differentiation. We show here that levels and activity of RhoA protein are down-regulated in both primary avian myoblasts and mouse satellite cells undergoing differentiation, suggesting that a fine regulation of this GTPase is required. In addition, ectopic expression of activated RhoA in primary quail myocytes, but not in mouse myocytes, inhibits accumulation of muscle-specific proteins and cell fusion. By disrupting RhoA signaling with specific inhibitors, we have shown that this GTPase, although required for cell identity in proliferating myoblasts, is not essential for commitment to terminal differentiation and muscle gene expression. Ectopic expression of an activated form of its downstream effector, Rock, impairs differentiation of both avian and mouse myoblasts. Conversely, Rock inhibition with specific inhibitors and small interfering RNA-mediated gene silencing leads to accelerated progression in the lineage and enhanced cell fusion, underscoring a negative regulatory function of Rock in myogenesis. Finally, we have reported that Rock acts independently from RhoA in preventing myoblast exit from the cell cycle and commitment to differentiation and may receive signaling inputs from Raf-1 kinase.

Rudnicki M.A. Front. Biosci. 2000; 5: D750-767Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When subjected to differentiation cues, such as serum removal, myoblasts withdraw from the cell cycle and initiate the myogenic differentiation program through the accumulation of the transcription factor myogenin (1Perry R.L. Rudnicki M.A. Front. Biosci. 2000; 5: D750-767Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and of tissue-specific contractile proteins. Full maturation is attained through fusion of post-mitotic myocytes into polynucleated myotubes and the assembly of myofibrils. Myogenesis can therefore be seen as a two-state process consisting of commitment and progression, both requiring an active interplay between positive and negative regulatory signals.Members of the Rho family of small GTPases (RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42), initially identified as regulators of the actin cytoskeleton, are involved in modulating multiple signal transduction pathways affecting processes such as cell migration, cell cycle progression, and gene expression (2Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3796) Google Scholar, 3Coleman M.L. Marshall C.J. Olson M.F. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 355-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). In myogenic cells, Rho GTPases have been shown to play a critical role in skeletal muscle differentiation. Whereas it is generally agreed that Rac1 and Cdc42 act as negative regulators of the onset of myogenesis (4Gallo R. Serafini M. Castellani L. Falcone G. Alemà S. Mol. Biol.

J. 2000; 348: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1661) Google Scholar), is not fully established, although extensively investigated. Forced expression of RhoA has been shown to bring about the myogenic potential of mouse embryo fibroblasts (8Sordella R. Jiang W. Chen G.C. Curto M. Settleman J. Cell. 2003; 113: 147-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) to accelerate myoblast differentiation (5Meriane M. Roux P. Primig M. Fort P. Gauthier-Rouviere C. Mol.

Conversely, RhoA activity diminishes myogenin and myosin accumulation in primary avian myoblasts induced to differentiate (4Gallo R. Serafini M. Castellani L. Falcone G. Alemà S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3137-3150Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and inhibits myoblast fusion and myosin accumulation in the murine myogenic cell line C2C12 through Rock (13Nishiyama T. Kii I. Kudo A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47311-47319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 14Charrasse S. Comunale F. Grumbach Y. Poulat F. Blangy A. Gauthier-Rouviere C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Only recently it has been reported that Rock activity and localization can be modulated by Raf-1 during migration of mouse keratinocytes and fibroblasts (15Ehrenreiter K. Piazzola D. Velamoor V. Sobczak I. Small J.V. Takeda J. Leung T. Baccarini M. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 68: 955-964Crossref Scopus (161) Google Scholar), suggesting that Rock may receive inputs from other signaling molecules.The accumulated evidence describes apparently contrasting roles of RhoA in skeletal myogenesis, possibly because of the heterogeneity of the experimental strategy adopted and the variety of the myogenic cell contexts utilized. In this report, we set out to evaluate the contribution of RhoA and its downstream effector, Rock, in temporally distinct phases of skeletal muscle differentiation (proliferating myoblasts versus postmitotic myocytes) and in two different cell contexts, primary avian myoblasts and established murine cell lines, to define common functions and possible cell-specific differences. Ectopic expression of constitutively active RhoA diminished the accumulation of muscle-specific proteins in avian myocytes but not in murine myocytes, whereas expression of activated Rock impaired differentiation in both avian and mouse cells. Specific alteration of endogenous RhoA and Rock in both cell types, by different means, resulted in distinct phenotypes, whereas inhibition of endogenous RhoA did not significantly perturb myogenic differentiation, inhibition of Rock improved differentiation of myoblasts, and fusion of myocytes. Together our findings indicate that RhoA and Rock may act independently in myoblasts, as they play distinct roles in maintaining myoblast identity and controlling commitment to terminal differentiation. Finally, we show that, in addition to RhoA, Rock may receive signaling inputs by Raf-1 kinase.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials and Antibodies—Highly purified Triton X-100 and Nonidet P-40 were from Roche Applied Science.

Cossu (Vitasalute San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy). Rabbit serum to chicken myogenin was provided by B. Paterson (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). A polyclonal antibody to chicken skeletal muscle myosin was developed in our laboratory using purified chicken muscle myosin as the immunogen (4Gallo R. Serafini M. Castellani L. Falcone G. Alemà S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3137-3150Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to total and phosphorylated ERKs were from Cell Signaling Technologies. Fluorescein isothiocyanate- and TRITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and anti-mouse antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies were from Bio-Rad.Cell Cultures and Viral Infection—Primary cultures of quail myoblasts (QMb) were prepared as described previously (16Falcone G. Alemà S. Tatò F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3331-3338Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and maintained proliferating in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 10% tryptose phosphate broth, and 3% quail embryo extract (growth medium (GM)) at 37 °C. Polyclonal populations of quail myoblasts transformed by a temperature-sensitive mutant of the Rous sarcoma virus (QMb-LA29) were established as described previously (16Falcone G. Alemà S. Tatò F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3331-3338Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Differentiation was induced by plating the cells on collagen-coated dishes in GM and the following day by substituting GM with F-14 medium supplemented with 2% fetal calf serum (differentiation medium (DM)). C2C12 myoblasts were maintained proliferating at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum (GM), as described (17Falcone G. Ciuffini L. Gauzzi M.C. Provenzano C. Strano S. Gallo R. Castellani L. Alemà S. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8302-8315Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Differentiation was induced by incubating the cultures in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 2% horse serum (DM). For endogenous RhoA quantitation, C2C12 were induced to differentiate in DM also containing 25 μm [(3)H]1-β-d-arabinofuranosylcytosine to inhibit cell proliferation.To induce myogenic differentiation without cellular fusion, QMb-LA29 and C2C12 were cultivated in a DM supplemented with 1.85 and 1.4 mm EGTA, respectively (low calcium DM). Note that Western blot analysis of extracts from both QMb and C2C12 myoblasts induced to differentiate in low calcium DM showed that EGTA did not affect accumulation of muscle-specific proteins. This finding differs from a previous report showing that inhibition of N-cadherin-dependent adhesion impairs muscle-specific gene expression (18Charrasse S. Causeret M. Comunale F. Bonet-Kerrache A. Gauthier-Rouviere C. J. Muscle Res. Cell. Motil. 2003; 24: 309-313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).High-titer stocks of adenoviruses expressing GFP were a gift of M. Crescenzi (Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy), and adenoviruses co-expressing Myc-tagged RhoAV14 and GFP were provided by G. P. Dotto (University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland) (19Calautti E. Grossi M. Mammucari C. Aoyama Y. Pirro M. Ono Y. Li J. Dotto G.P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 137-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). After infection, QMb-LA29 were kept in GM for 24 h to allow virus expression before induction of differentiation in a modified DM containing 10% fetal calf serum. This medium was chosen because high serum was found to improve expression of the transgene. The percentage of infection was measured by counting GFP-expressing cells kept proliferating at 35 °C and found to be close to 90%.High-titer stocks of retroviruses carrying the activated human Raf-1 C terminus half, fused to human estrogen receptor (pBP3:ΔRaf-1DD:ER) (20Bosch E. Cherwinski H. Peterson D. McMahon M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1021-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), were used to infect C2C12 myoblasts. After puromycin (1.5 μg/ml) selection, cells were analyzed for ΔRaf-1:ER protein expression using an anti-ER antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). ΔRaf-1:ER expressing myoblasts were cultivated and induced to differentiate as parental C2C12 cells. Induction of the protein was obtained by the addition of 1 μm β-estradiol to either GM or DM.Expression Vectors and Reporter Constructs—The expression vectors used were the following: pEGFP (Promega Italia), pEGFPRac1V12 (GFP-Rac1V12 fusion protein), and pEGFPRhoAV14 (GFP-RhoAV14) (21Vartiainen M. Ojala P.J. Auvinen P. Peranen J. Lappalainen P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1772-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), RK5-RhoAN19 (Myc-tagged RhoAN19, provided by A. Hall), pCAG-Rock1-Δ3 (RockΔ3) (22Ishizaki T. Naito M. Fujisawa K. Maekawa M. Watanabe N. Saito Y. Narumiya S.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 118-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar), and pSG5-HRasV12 (RasV12, provided by C. J. Marshall, Institute of Cancer Research, London, UK). Plasmid pGEX3X-C21(Rhotekin) for bacterial expression of recombinant fusion protein GST-C21 was provided by J. Collard (The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands), and plasmid pGEX2TK-RhoAV14 for recombinant GST-RhoAV14 was from A. Hall.Transient Transfections—Proliferating myoblasts were transfected with the Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) in serum-free Opti-MEM (Invitrogen). Alternatively, quail myoblasts were transfected in GM using the N,N-bis-(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid/calcium phosphate precipitation technique (23Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4810) Google Scholar). After transfection, the cells were kept in GM for 24 h to allow transgene expression before being further processed.Small interfering RNA (siRNA) sequences against Rock-I and -II were from Dharmacon (siGenome duplexes D-046504-04 and D-040429-02, respectively), and a nonspecific duplex was used as the control. C2C12 cells were transfected with 100 nm individual oligonucleotide using serum-free Opti-MEM and Lipofectamine. After 5 h, the medium was replaced with GM and maintained for a minimum of 24 h. The extent of siRNA-mediated inhibition of Rock-I and -II protein accumulation was evaluated by Western blot analysis with specific antibodies, and only the experiments in which at least 50% inhibition of both proteins was detected were further processed.For transient transgene expression, 1–2 μg of plasmid DNA was transfected per 35-mm dish. In co-transfection experiments, 0.2 μgof RhoAV14 DNA was transfected along with 2 μg of DN-Rock DNA. Empty vector was used to normalize for DNA content when necessary. 24 h after transfection, QMb-LA29 were shifted to 41 °C in low calcium DM for 2 days. C2C12 myoblasts were maintained in GM or induced to differentiate in DM for two days at low density to minimize the extent of fusion. All of the cultures were then fixed and processed for immunofluorescence for the transfected proteins and for the endogenous muscle-specific proteins. Levels of expression of the transfected proteins were monitored by Western blot in parallel cultures.Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) Labeling and Immunofluorescence Analysis—For BrdUrd incorporation studies, QMb-LA29 transfected at 35 °C were shifted to 41 °C in DM and labeled with 20 μm BrdUrd for various time periods following shift up, as required. 48 h after siRNA transfection or 24 h after the addition of 10 μm Y27632 inhibitor, C2C12 were labeled with 20 μm BrdUrd for 3 h, fixed, and then processed for immunofluorescence.For immunofluorescence analysis, cultures were routinely fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline, and processed as previously described (17Falcone G. Ciuffini L. Gauzzi M.C. Provenzano C. Strano S. Gallo R. Castellani L. Alemà S. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8302-8315Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 24Castellani L. Reedy M.C. Gauzzi M.C. Provenzano C. Alemà S. Falcone G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 871-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The samples were examined with an Olympus microscope. Images were recorded on a charge-coupled device camera and processed using software by Delta Sistemi (Rome, Italy) and Adobe Photoshop.Whole-cell Extracts and Western Blot Analysis—Cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors as previously described (4Gallo R. Serafini M. Castellani L. Falcone G. Alemà S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3137-3150Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Western blots were carried out using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and anti-mouse antibodies and revealed with a chemiluminescence detection system by Pierce. Quantitation of the bands was carried out by scanning films using the CanoScan D2400U scanner by Canon and evaluating the band intensity using ImageQuant software.RhoA Activity Assay—QMb, QMb-LA29, and C2C12 cells were harvested according to the method of Ren and Schwartz (25Ren X.D. Schwartz M.A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 325: 264-272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cleared lysates were incubated with 20 μg of GST-C21 beads at 4 °C for 45 min. Precipitated protein was resolved on 13% SDS-PAGE, blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Roche Applied Science) and detected using antibodies to RhoA. The relative amount of active RhoA was determined by densitometric analysis as described above.RNA Isolation and Northern Blots—Aliquots of total RNA (10–20 μg) were resolved in 0.9% agarose/2.2 m formaldehyde gels, transferred to nylon membrane, and hybridized with labeled probes according to standard procedures. For detection of transcripts, inserts of the following plasmids were used as probes: pRSET-cRhoA containing a 600-bp chicken RhoA cDNA (obtained from I. De Curtis, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy), cC118 containing a 590-bp quailα-actin cDNA, cC127 containing a 600-bp quail myosin light chain cDNA, cC128 containing a 500-bp quail myosin heavy chain cDNA, pA1 containing a 2-kb chicken β-actin cDNA, and a plasmid containing a 1.2-kb avian glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-deydrogenase cDNA (16Falcone G. Alemà S. Tatò F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3331-3338Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Quantitative analysis was carried out using a Molecular Dynamics 400A phosphorimaging device with ImageQuant software.RESULTSRhoA is Down-regulated upon Skeletal Muscle Terminal Differentiation—To investigate the role of RhoA during differentiation of skeletal muscle cells, we first set out to determine the levels of expression and activity of endogenous RhoA protein in both primary cells and established cell lines of avian and mammalian origin. Specifically, we compared primary embryonal QMb and QMb expressing a temperature-sensitive mutant of v-Src tyrosine kinase to C2C12 murine myoblasts, because QMb are highly prone to differentiation, whereas mammalian myoblasts have been widely used to study RhoA function during in vitro myogenesis (11Takano H. Komuro I. Oka T. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y. Mizuno T. Yazaki Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1580-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 12Wei L. Zhous W. Croissant J.D. Johansen F.E. Prywes R.

Chem. 2004; 279: 47311-47319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The additional advantage of QMb-LA29 is that they can be kept proliferating both in GM and DM at the permissive temperature for the v-Src kinase (35 °C) and can synchronously differentiate into multinucleate myotubes exhibiting a high degree of structural maturation when shifted to the restrictive temperature (41 °C) (4Gallo R. Serafini M. Castellani L. Falcone G. Alemà S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3137-3150Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 24Castellani L. Reedy M.C. Gauzzi M.C. Provenzano C. Alemà S. Falcone G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 871-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).Western blot analysis of cellular extracts derived from QMb and C2C12 kept proliferating in GM or differentiating for various days in DM showed a progressive reduction of RhoA protein as differentiation proceeded (Fig. 1, A and B). To establish whether the diminished accumulation of RhoA was due to the reduction of growth factors in DM or to myogenic differentiation, QMb-LA29 were also analyzed in DM at 35 °C. As shown in Fig. 1C, a pronounced reduction of RhoA protein paralleling the maturation process of myotubes at 41 °C was observed. The degree of muscle differentiation was evaluated in the three cell types by monitoring the accumulation of sarcomeric α-actin and the reduction of the β-actin isoform (Fig. 1, A–C).To investigate whether the reduction of the RhoA protein was due to down-regulation of the transcript, mRNAs were prepared from QMb-LA29 (Fig. 1C), kept proliferating at 35 °C or induced to differentiate at 41 °C for up to three days, and analyzed by Northern blot. As shown in Fig. 1C, accumulation of the RhoA transcript was diminished in myotubes as compared with proliferating myoblasts, paralleling the reduction of the protein.To measure RhoA activity in myocytes, given the reduction of RhoA protein during differentiation, cellular extracts were normalized for total RhoA content before being subjected to a pull-down assay using as bait Rhotekin, a RhoA effector protein that binds only to active RhoA-GTP (26Reid T. Furuyashiki T. Ishizaki T. Watanabe G. Watanabe N. Fujisawa K. Morii N. Madaule P. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13556-13560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). RhoA-GTP content was highly reduced both in primary and QMb-LA29 myotubes as compared with proliferating QMb and QMb-LA29 kept in GM and DM at 35 °C (Fig. 1D). RhoA-GTP was equally reduced in QMb differentiated at 37 or 41 °C and in QMb-LA29 induced to differentiate at high density in GM at 41 °C (not shown). The amount of RhoA-GTP was slightly augmented in extracts of differentiated C2C12 myotubes normalized for total RhoA content, as compared with that of proliferating myoblasts (Fig. 1D). However, taking into account that RhoA protein was highly reduced in differentiated C2C12 (Fig. 1B), total RhoA activity in myotubes was diminished.Constitutively Active RhoA and Rock Modulate Myogenesis—The finding that total RhoA activity is reduced during differentiation of both mouse and quail myoblasts is in apparent contrast with previous reports describing a promoting effect of constitutively active RhoAV14 on transcription from certain muscle-specific promoters in mammalian myoblasts (11Takano H. Komuro I. Oka T. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y. Mizuno T. Yazaki Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1580-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 12Wei L. Zhous W. Croissant J.D. Johansen F.E. Prywes R. Balasubramanyam A. Schwarts R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30287-30294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). To clarify this issue, we measured the ability of C2C12 and QMb-LA29 myoblasts to differentiate when expressing RhoAV14 or RockΔ3, a constitutively active deletion mutant of Rock lacking the C terminus (22Ishizaki T. Naito M. Fujisawa K. Maekawa M. Watanabe N. Saito Y. Narumiya S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 118-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Proliferating cells, transiently transfected with expression vectors for the constitutively active mutants RhoAV14, RockΔ3, Rac1V12, RasV12, the dominant negative mutants RhoAN19 and DN-Rock, and pEGFP as the control were induced to differentiate at low density (C2C12) or in low calcium DM (QMb-LA29) to allow single cell count and processed for immunofluorescence. Levels of expression of exogenous proteins were measured by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2A). Scoring of the cultures for co-expression of the transgene and of myogenin clearly showed that RhoAV14 effectively reduced the number of myocytes expressing myogenin only in QMb-LA29, whereas RockΔ3 exerted its inhibitory action on both C2C12 and QMb-LA29, as did also Rac1V12 and RasV12 (Fig. 2A). RhoAN19 did not alter differentiation of both avian and mammalian myocytes, suggesting that endogenous RhoA activity was not required to attain terminal differentiation in both cell types. Because RhoAV14 did not exert any apparent effect on differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts, we verified whether its expression was effective in increasing actin stress fiber formation, as reported for many other cell types (2Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3796) Google Scholar). Indeed, C2C12 myoblasts expressing RhoAV14 exhibited pronounced stress fibers compared with control cells expressing GFP (Fig. 2B). In addition, to confirm that, as described in other cells, actin stress fiber induction was mediated by Rock (7Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1661) Google Scholar, 22Ishizaki T. Naito M. Fujisawa K. Maekawa M. Watanabe N. Saito Y. Narumiya S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 118-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar), proliferating C2C12 myoblasts were co-transfected with RhoAV14 and DN-Rock or transfected with RhoAV14 and treated with the Rock pharmacological inhibitor Y27632 (10 μm, 27) and stained for F-actin. Both DN-Rock and Y27632 efficiently inhibited RhoAV14-induced stress fibers (Fig. 2B) and reduced F-actin content in GFP-expressing and control cells, clearly indicating that the RhoA/Rock axis is active for the control of the actin cytoskeleton.FIGURE 2The RhoAV14/Rock pathway inhibits myogenin expression in avian myocytes and regulates the actin cytoskeleton in C2C12 myoblasts. A, C2C12 and QMb-LA29 were transfected in GM at 37 and 35 °C, respectively, with the indicated expression vectors and the day after transferred to DM at 37 (C2C12) and 41 °C (QMb-LA29). Two days later, the cells were processed for immunofluorescence for the transfected protein and endogenous myogenin. The percentage of transfected cells expressing myogenin, referred to as control GFP taken as 100%, is shown in the histogram. At least 300 transfected cells were examined for each condition in every experiment. The levels of the transfected proteins, compared with endogenous RhoA, were analyzed by Western blot. DN-Rock and RockΔ3 were revealed with anti-Myc antibody, RhoAV14, and RhoAN19 and endogenous RhoA with anti-RhoA antibody, Rac1V12 with anti-Rac1 antibody, RasV12 with anti-Ras antibody, and GFP with anti-GFP antibody. B, C2C12 myoblasts were transfected with expression vectors for GFP or GFP-RhoAV14 or co-transfected with GFP-RhoAV14 and DN-Rock (1:10) and the following day incubated in GM with vehicle or Y27632, as indicated. 24 h later, the cells were processed for immunofluorescence and stained for F-actin with phalloidin.

https://openalex.org/W1966256304,"Here we present a finished sequence of human chromosome 15, together with a high-quality gene catalogue. As chromosome 15 is one of seven human chromosomes with a high rate of segmental duplication, we have carried out a detailed analysis of the duplication structure of the chromosome. Segmental duplications in chromosome 15 are largely clustered in two regions, on proximal and distal 15q; the proximal region is notable because recombination among the segmental duplications can result in deletions causing Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes. Sequence analysis shows that the proximal and distal regions of 15q share extensive ancient similarity. Using a simple approach, we have been able to reconstruct many of the events by which the current duplication structure arose. We find that most of the intrachromosomal duplications seem to share a common ancestry. Finally, we demonstrate that some remaining gaps in the genome sequence are probably due to structural polymorphisms between haplotypes; this may explain a significant fraction of the gaps remaining in the human genome."
https://openalex.org/W1964333560,"Galaxy formation is believed to proceed in a 'bottom up' manner, starting with the formation of small clumps of gas and stars that then merge hierarchically into giant systems. The baryonic gas loses thermal energy by radiative cooling and falls towards the centres of the new galaxies, while supernovae blow gas out. Any realistic model therefore requires a proper treatment of these processes, but hitherto this has been far from satisfactory. Here we report a simulation that follows evolution from the earliest stages of galaxy formation through the period of dynamical relaxation, at which point the resulting galaxy is in its final form. The bubble structures of gas revealed in our simulation (for times of less than 3 x 10(8) years) resemble closely high-redshift Lyman-alpha emitters. After 10(9) years, these bodies are dominated by stellar continuum radiation and then resemble the Lyman break galaxies, which are high-redshift star-forming galaxies. At this point, the abundance of elements heavier than helium ('metallicity') appears to be solar. After 1.3 x 10(10) years, these galaxies resemble present-day ellipticals."
https://openalex.org/W2074569125,"Mutations in presenilin 1 (PS1) lead to dominant inheritance of early onset familial Alzheimer disease (FAD). These mutations are known to alter the γ-secretase cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein, resulting in increased ratio of Aβ42/Aβ40 and accelerated amyloid plaque pathology in transgenic mouse models. To investigate the factors that drive the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio and amyloid pathogenesis and to investigate the possible interactions between wild-type and FAD mutant PS1, which are co-expressed in transgenic animals, we expressed the PS1 M146V knock-in allele either on wild-type PS1 (PS1M146V/+) or PS1 null (PS1M146V/–) background and crossed these alleles with the Tg2576 APP transgenic mice. Introduction of the PS1 M146V mutation on Tg2576 background resulted in earlier onset of plaque pathology. Surprisingly, removing the wild-type PS1 in the presence of the PS1 M146V mutation (PS1M146V/–) greatly exacerbated the amyloid burden; and this was attributed to a reduction of γ-secretase activity rather than an increase in Aβ42. Our findings establish a protective role of the wild-type PS1 against the FAD mutation-induced amyloid pathology through a partial loss-of-function mechanism.

APP is processed by at least three proteinases known as α-, β-, and γ-secretases. Both α- and β-secretases (BACE1) process APP in the extracellular domain with α-secretase cleavage occurring inside the Aβ domain and BACE1 at the amino terminus of Aβ. These proteolytic events generate APP carboxyl-terminal fragments (CTF), which serve as substrates for subsequent γ-secretase processing, producing either p3 (product of α- and γ-secretases) or Aβ peptides (product of BACE1 and γ-secretase) (reviewed in Ref. 1Wilquet V. De Strooper B. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2004; 14: 582-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar).

Recent evidence supports a sequential cleavage model in which ε-cleavage at the cytosol-membrane junction serves as the initial cutting site followed by ξ- and γ-processing within the membrane (14Zhao G.

Therefore, although Aβ40 and Aβ42 are measurements of specific products of γ-secretase cleavage of APP, levels of the CTF of APP as well as other PS1 substrates, which result from insufficient PS1-dependent processing, inversely correlate with total γ-secretase activity. Mutations in PS1 lead to autosomal dominant inheritance of familial Alzheimer disease (FAD).

Although such a pathogenic effect by the FAD mutations can be interpreted as “gain-of-misfunction,” the following observations do not support this simple explanation. 1) The mutations spread throughout the entire molecule. Although the majority of the mutations are missense mutations, both insertion and deletion mutations have also been identified. Thus, these mutations are indicative of a haplo-insufficiency (partial loss-of-function) or dominant-negative mechanism. Consistent with this notion, several published reports document that various PS1 FAD mutants exhibit impaired γ-secretase activities on APP, Notch, and cadherins (8Marambaud P. Wen P.H. Dutt A.

This can result from elevated production of Aβ42, a reduction of Aβ40, or both combined. Indeed, several publications indicate that increase in Aβ42 is at the expense of reduced Aβ40 (23Siman R. Reaume A.G. Savage M.J. Trusko S. Lin Y.G. Scott R.W. Flood D.G. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8717-8726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Steiner H. Kostka M. Romig H. Basset G. Pesold B. Hardy J. Capell A.

Furthermore, because the wild-type PS1 is present in all reported studies, whether the observed changes in Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio are due to intrinsic properties of the mutant protein or the interactions between the wild type and the mutant PS1 has not been explored. To better understand the pathogenic mechanisms of the PS1 FAD mutations, we used PS1 M146V knock-in mice in which the M146V FAD mutation was introduced into the endogenous mouse PS1 gene in an otherwise completely physiological context (25Guo Q. Fu W. Sopher B.L. Miller M.W. Ware C.B. Martin G.M. Mattson M.P. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar) and expressed the PS1 M146V allele either with or without the other allele of wild-type PS1 (PS1M146V/+ or PS1M146V/–, respectively). As expected, expression of the mutant PS1 with APP transgenic mice (APP/PS1M146V/+) led to an earlier onset of plaque pathology (26Hsiao K. Chapman P. Nilsen S. Eckman C. Harigaya Y. Younkin S. Yang F. Cole G. Science. 1996; 274: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (3635) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, removal of the allele of wild-type PS1 (APP/PS1M146V/–) further increased amyloid load through an overall reduction of γ-secretase activity. Antibodies and Peptides—The rabbit polyclonal APP antibody was raised against the carboxyl-terminal 15 amino acids of human APP. Anti-Aβ monoclonal antibodies 4G8 and 6E10 were purchased from Signet, and anti-N-cadherin antibody was obtained from BD Transduction Laboratories. Aβ-(1–40) and Aβ-(1–42) peptides were purchased from Bachem. Animals—The PS1 M146V knock-in (25Guo Q. Fu W. Sopher B.L. Miller M.W. Ware C.B. Martin G.M. Mattson M.P. Nat.

All animal experiments were performed in accordance with the Baylor College of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and with national regulations and policies. Immunohistochemistry and Amyloid Load Quantification—Antibody staining on paraffin-embedded brain sections was performed as described (19Dineley K.T. Xia X. Bui D. Sweatt J.D. Zheng H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22768-22780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Briefly, paraformaldehyde-perfused brains were cut into 6-μm paraffin sections. The sections were deparaffinized by heating at 55 °C for 15 min and incubated in 60% formic acid for 6 min. The slides were further deparaffinized in xylene and then rinsed with 100, 95, and 70% ethanol and water. Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched by incubating the slides in 3% H2O2 in methanol for 30 min. The slides were rinsed with water and Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 250 mm NaCl). Nonspecific epitopes were blocked for 30 min with 3% normal goat serum, 0.1% Triton X-100 in TBS. Primary antibody 6E10 was diluted 1:1000 in TBS containing 2% goat serum and incubated overnight at room temperature in a humid chamber. Sections were then washed four times for 10 min each in TBS and incubated with anti-mouse secondary antibody-peroxidase-coupled streptavidin (Vectastain ABC kit; Vector Laboratories). Pictures were taken with a Zeiss Axioskop 2 Plus microscope equipped with the Axiocam MRC digital camera, and the images were processed with the Axiovision 3.1 software. Images covering the entire cortex were taken (10 sections per brain, 300 μm spacing). The number of Aβ plaques (>5 μm) were counted manually under an Olympus microscope (CX 31). Data were reported as the total number of plaques divided by the total cortical area for each animal. For thioflavine S staining, the paraffin-embedded slices were incubated in 0.5% thioflavine S in PBS for 10 min in the dark. Fluorescent signals were visualized after decolorizing with 95% ethanol. Five animals/genotype/age were analyzed. Sandwich ELISA—Sandwich ELISAs for quantifying human Aβ40 and Aβ42 were performed as described using 6E10 as the capture antibody and AB112 and AB115 as detection antibodies, which recognize Aβ40 and Aβ42 specifically (29Xia X.

Nature. 1999; 402: 533-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar). Briefly, 4× TBS buffer (v/w) was used to homogenize brain samples, which were centrifuged at 8000 × g for 1 h. The pellet was resuspended in 5 m guanidine twice and sonicated. 20 μl of homogenate was diluted with 10× loading buffer. After centrifugation at 8000 × g for 30 min, the samples were loaded into wells for Aβ-peptide detection. 100 μl of 6E10 (4 μg/ml) diluted in carbonate-bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6, was added to coated microtiter plates and incubated at 4 °C overnight. After washing with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST), the plates were blocked for 1 h with 200 μl of PBST with 1% bovine serum albumin. 100 μl of standards was then applied and incubated for 2 h at room temperature or 4 °C overnight. Plates were incubated with biotinylated AB112 or AB115 diluted 1:1000 and 1:500, respectively, in PBST at room temperature for 1.5 h. Neutravidin-horseradish peroxidase (Pierce) diluted 1:5000 in PBST was added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After washing the plate three times, 100 μl/ml 3,3′5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine solution was added and incubated for 15–30 min at room temperature. The color development was stopped by adding 100 μl/well stop solution (1 m phosphoric acid). The optical density was measured at 490 nm by a microELISA reader. The concentrations of Aβ40 and Aβ42 in the samples were calculated from the standard curve within the linear range for each plate, respectively. Six forebrain samples/genotype/age were analyzed each in triplets. Western Blotting—For regular Western blotting, protein extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto 0.2-μm nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). Nonspecific sites were blocked by incubation in 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk, 0.1% Tween 20. The membranes were incubated with primary antibodies followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and visualized with the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system (Amersham Biosciences). For Aβ detection, brain lysates were loaded and separated on a 16.5% mini Bicine-urea-PAGE (31Klafki H.W. Wiltfang J. Staufenbiel M. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 237: 24-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) using a semi-dry electrophoretic transfer cell. Membranes were boiled in phosphate-buffered saline for 3 min and immunoblotted with mouse monoclonal antibody 6E10 (Signet). Synthetic Aβ-(1–40) and Aβ-(1–42) peptides were used as internal standards for the identification of the corresponding Aβ species in the gel. In Vitro γ-Secretase Activity—γ-Secretase activity was assayed using a peptide substrate as described (32Li Y.M. Lai M.T. Xu M. Huang Q. DiMuzio-Mower J. Sardana M.K. Shi X.P. Yin K.C. Shafer J.A.

The γ-secretase-mediated 40- and 42-site cleavages were detected by ECL using the ruthenylated G2–10 and G2–11 antibodies, respectively. The nonspecific cleavage is defined as signal in the presence of 1 μm γ-secretase inhibitor L-685,458. Specific γ-secretase activity was obtained by subtracting nonspecific from total ECL signals. Protective Role of Wild-type PS1 against Amyloid Pathology—To evaluate possible genetic interactions of wild-type and FAD mutant PS1 alleles on Aβ production and amyloid pathology, we crossed the PS1 M146V homozygous (PS1M146V/M146V) mice with Tg2576 APP transgenic mice to obtain animals that were transgenic for APP and heterozygous for the PS1 M146V knock-in allele (APP/PS1M146V/+). These mice were then bred with PS1 heterozygous null animals (PS1+/–) to generate APP positive mice expressed on wild-type PS1 (+/+), PS1+/– (+/–), PS1M146V/+ (M146V/+), or PS1M146V/– (M146V/–) background (Fig. 1A). Females were used in all studies to eliminate potential variability contributed by gender differences. We carried out Aβ immunohistochemistry (Fig. 1B) and thioflavine S staining (Fig. 1C) and quantified the amyloid plaque pathology (Fig. 1D) in the above animals at 3 months of age. As expected, no plaque deposition could be detected in APP animals expressed on either PS1+/+ or PS1+/– background (data not shown). Limited plaques could be seen in the cortex and hippocampus of APP/PS1M146V/+ (M146V/+) mice at this age (Fig. 1B, a and b, respectively), and they were largely thioflavine S negative (Fig. 1C, a and b). Surprisingly, removing the wild-type PS1 allele (APP/PS1M146V/– or M146V/–) led to a 3–4-fold increase in the plaque load (Fig. 1B, c and d, and quantified in Fig. 1D), and a significant portion of the plaques was thioflavine S-positive (Fig. 1C, c and d). At 12 months, limited plaque pathology could be detected in APP/PS1+/+ mouse brains (+/+; Fig. 2A). Introduction of the PS1 M146V FAD mutation enhanced the amyloid load (compare +/+ with M146V/+; Fig. 2A). Similar to results obtained from 3-month-old animals, compared with APP/PS1M146V/+ mice, removing the wild-type PS1 led to a greater amyloid deposition as evidenced by both Aβ immunostaining and by thioflavine S staining (compare M146V/+ with M146V/–, Fig. 2, A and B, and quantified in Fig. 2C). Western blot analysis of Aβ40 and Aβ42 using a Bicine-urea-gel system (31Klafki H.W. Wiltfang J. Staufenbiel M. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 237: 24-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) revealed more SDS-extractable Aβ in M146V/– samples compared with M146V/+ (Fig. 2D). Overall, these results demonstrate that wild-type PS1 antagonizes the FAD mutation-induced Aβ pathology. Removing Wild-type PS1 Leads to Reduced Aβ and Increased Aβ42/Aβ40 Ratio—To investigate the mechanisms contributing to the accelerated plaque deposition in APP/PS1M146V/– mice, we measured human Aβ levels in forebrain samples of the above animals by sandwich ELISA (Fig. 3). Several interesting findings emerged: (i) similar to our previous analysis of endogenous Aβ (35Qian S. Jiang P. Guan X.M. Singh G. Trumbauer M.E. Yu H. Chen H.Y. Van de Ploeg L.H. Zheng H. Neuron. 1998; 20: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), reduction of 50% PS1 dosage resulted in a significant decrease in both Aβ40 and Aβ42 without altering the ratio of Aβ42/Aβ40 (compare +/+ with +/–; Fig. 3, C–E); (ii) consistent with the Aβ data obtained from PS1 A264L knock-in mice (23Siman R. Reaume A.G. Savage M.J. Trusko S. Lin Y.G. Scott R.W. Flood D.G. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8717-8726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), expression of the PS1 M146V FAD mutation was accompanied by a simultaneous reduction of Aβ40 and increase in Aβ42 (compare +/+ with M146V/+; Fig. 3, C and D); (iii) removal of the remaining wild-type PS1 from the APP/PS1M146V/+ mice led to a further reduction of Aβ40 without significantly affecting Aβ42 (compare M146V/– with M146V/+; Fig. 3, C and D); and (iv) although the increase in the ratio of Aβ42/Aβ40 in M146V/+ animals was because of a simultaneous reduction of Aβ40 and increase in Aβ42 (compare +/+ with M146V/+; Fig. 3E), further enhancement of this ratio in M146V/– mice was solely contributed by an impaired Aβ40 production as Aβ42 remained constant (compare M146V/– with M146V/+; Fig. 3E). Therefore, exacerbated plaque pathology present in M146V/– mice (Figs. 1 and 2) is likely caused by a reduced Aβ40, hence the increased ratio of Aβ42/Aβ40 rather than an increased Aβ42. To provide further support for the sandwich ELISA data, we performed the in vitro γ-secretase activity assay by incubating the membrane proteins from the wild-type (+/+), PS1 M146V/+, or PS1 M146V/– mouse brains with the APP substrate and measuring the amount of γ-secretase-dependent Aβ40 and Aβ42 production (Fig. 4) (32Li Y.M.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17050-17055Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Consistent with our sandwich ELISA results, Aβ40 was significantly lower in PS1 M146V/+ samples compared with wild-type controls (Fig. 4A). Levels of Aβ40 were further reduced drastically in PS1 M146V/– mice when compared with both wild-type and PS1 M146V/+ animals (Fig. 4A). In contrast to the sandwich ELISA, the in vitro γ-secretase activity assay did not detect increases of Aβ42 in PS1 M146V animals (compare +/+ with M146V/+; Fig. 4B). Interestingly, similar to Aβ40, levels of Aβ42 were also significantly reduced by removing the wild-type PS1 (compare M146V/– with M146V/+ and +/+; Fig. 4B). The differences in Aβ42 measurement by the two assays could be caused by differences of the detection systems. Specifically, sandwich ELISA detects the steady-state levels of Aβ and reveals the net effect of production and clearance. In contrast, the in vitro γ-secretase assay measures the rate of Aβ production. Nevertheless, the ratios of Aβ42 to Aβ40 are in total agreement between the two assays, with M146V/–> M146V/+>+/+ (Fig. 4C), and this ratio correlates with the degree of amyloid pathology. Impaired Total γ-Secretase Processing in PS1 M146V/– Mice—Extracellular processing of APP by α-or β-secretases generates APP carboxyl-terminal fragments, which serve as substrates for γ-secretase cleavage. Therefore, although Aβ40 and Aβ42 are measurements of specific γ-secretase products, levels of APP-CTF, which result from insufficient PS-dependent processing, inversely correlate with total γ-secretase activity. Our sandwich ELISA and in vitro γ-secretase assay both documented reduced Aβ40 as well as total Aβ (Aβ40 + Aβ42) in PS1 M146V/– animals, supporting the view that exacerbated amyloid deposition by removing the wild-type PS1 is caused by an impaired γ-secretase activity. To substantiate this notion, we next determined the activity of PS1 M146V/– mice on overall PS-dependent processing. Two PS1 substrates were evaluated: APP-CTF and N-cadherin CTF. Western blot analysis of brain samples taken from wild-type (+/+), PS1 M146V/+, and PS1 M146V/– animals showed that the APP and N-cadherin levels remain constant among the three genotypes (Fig. 5, A and C). Although no significant differences in APP or N-cadherin CTF levels could be detected by comparing wild-type (+/+) and PS1 M146V/+ (M146V/+) samples, the APP and N-cadherin CTFs were both significantly higher in PS1 M146V/– brains (compare M146V/– with +/+ and M146V/+; Fig. 5, A and C). These led to the increases in the ratios of APP and N-cadherin CTF to full-length (FL) protein (Fig. 5, B and D). These data lend further support that impaired γ-secretase activity in PS1 M146V/– mice is the underlying mechanism for the accelerated amyloid plaque pathology. Previous genetic studies of PS1 mutations were largely carried out in transgenic mice overexpressing FAD mutant human PS1 in the presence of endogenous mouse PS1. The resulting Aβ levels are thus a combined effect of wild-type and mutant PS1. The net effect of mutant PS1 alone has not been investigated. In addition, ectopic overexpression of PS1 transgenes may alter the physiological assembly of the γ-secretase complex, leading to a mutation-independent effect. In the current study, we used the PS1 M146V knock-in mice in which the M146V FAD mutation was introduced into the endogenous mouse PS1 gene in an otherwise completely physiological background. We systematically investigated the effects of wild-type and mutant PS1 on Aβ production, γ-secretase processing, and amyloid plaque pathology by breeding the PS1 M146V knock-in and PS1 knock-out alleles onto a Tg2576 APP transgenic background. Aβ immunostaining and thioflavine S fluorescence established that expression of the PS1 M146V mutation on a Tg2576 APP transgenic background (APP/PS1M146V/+) led to the accelerated onset of plaque deposition from 10–12 months to 3–4 months. This result is in agreement with earlier publications and sets up the base line for us to investigate the interactions between the wild-type and FAD mutant PS1 (17Holcomb L. Gordon M.N. McGowan E.

As genetic ablation of PS1 has been shown to block Aβ production and amyloid pathology (36Dewachter I. Reverse D. Caluwaerts N. Ris L. Kuiperi C. Van den Haute C. Spittaels K. Umans L. Serneels L.

Kirkwood A. Morris R.G. Shen J. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 6755-6764Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), we expected to see ameliorated plaques by reducing PS1 dosage. Surprisingly, we found that removing the wild-type PS1 allele on PS1 M146V background (APP/PS1M146V/–) potently promoted the amyloid pathogenesis at various ages examined including 3 months (Fig. 1), 7 months (data not shown), and 12 months (Fig. 2). These results demonstrate a protective role of PS1 activity against FAD mutation-induced plaque deposition. Three assays were employed to determine the mechanisms underlying the pathogenic effect of the PS1 M146V mutation and the protective role of wild-type PS1: sandwich ELISA, in vitro γ-secretase activity assay, and Western blot quantification of CTFs of PS1 substrates APP and N-cadherin. Although sandwich ELISA and in vitro γ-secretase assay measure the specific γ-secretase cleavage products Aβ40 and Aβ42, the CTF levels inversely correlate with the total γ-secretase activity, as these are the results of insufficient processing by the γ-secretase. Sandwich ELISA documented a simultaneous reduction of Aβ40 and increase of Aβ42 by the PS1 M146V mutation (M146V/+ versus +/+; Fig. 3, C and D), an effect also observed in the PS1 P264L knock-in line (23Siman R. Reaume A.G. Savage M.J. Trusko S. Lin Y.G. Scott R.W. Flood D.G. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8717-8726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the in vitro γ-secretase assay failed to detect an increase in Aβ42 (M146V/+ versus +/+; Fig. 4B), both assays revealed a significant increase in the ratio of Aβ42/Aβ40 (M146V/+ versus +/+; Figs. 3E and 4C), consistent with the vast majority of published literature (reviewed in Ref. 2Iwatsubo T. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2004; 14: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). However, the combined data make it difficult to decipher the primary effect by the FAD mutation as increased Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio, and accelerated plaque deposition in APP/PS1M146V/+ animals could result from excessive production of Aβ42, a reduction of Aβ40, or both combined. Among the two Aβ species, McGowan et al. (38McGowan E. Pickford F. Kim J. Onstead L. Eriksen J. Yu C. Skipper L. Murphy M.P. Beard J. Das P. Jansen K. Delucia M. Lin W.L. Dolios G. Wang R. Eckman C.B. Dickson D.W. Hutton M. Hardy J. Golde T. Neuron. 2005; 47: 191-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar) recently reported that plaques can be formed in transgenic mice expressing Aβ42 alone but not Aβ40. This finding establishes a dominant effect of Aβ42 in amyloid pathogenesis. However, the potential role of Aβ40 in this process remains to be addressed. Measurement of Aβ levels by sandwich ELISA documented that removal of the remaining wild-type PS1 from M146V/+ mice (APP/PS1M146V/–) led to further reduction of Aβ40 without affecting Aβ42 (compare M146V/– with M146V/+; Fig. 3, C and D). The in vitro γ-secretase assay showed that both Aβ40 and Aβ42 were significantly reduced (M146V/– versus M146V/+; Fig. 4, A and B). The two experiments combined reveal that reduced Aβ40 rather than increased Aβ42 is the common denominator for the higher Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio (M146V/– versus M146V/+; Figs. 3E and 4C) and exacerbated plaque load in APP/PS1M146V/– animals. Our results are consistent with the notion that the ratio of Aβ42/Aβ40 is the key factor in amyloid pathogenesis, and we provide evidence that increase in this ratio can be achieved by a reduction of Aβ40 without increase in Aβ42. The reason for the apparent contrasting effects of Aβ40 and Aβ42 in amyloid deposition remains to be established. Because Aβ42 is believed to play a pivotal role in initiating the plaque pathology (39Iwatsubo T. Odaka A. Suzuki N. Mizusawa H. Nukina N. Ihara Y. Neuron. 1994; 13: 45-53Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1523) Google Scholar, 40Lansbury Jr., P.T. Neuron. 1997; 19: 1151-1154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), it is possible that Aβ40 interferes with the seeding process and thereby delays the plaque formation. In this regard, it will be interesting to cross Aβ40 and Aβ42 transgenic mice and determine the amyloid phenotype in these animals (38McGowan E. Pickford F. Kim J. Onstead L. Eriksen J. Yu C. Skipper L. Murphy M.P. Beard J. Das P. Jansen K. Delucia M. Lin W.L. Dolios G. Wang R. Eckman C.B. Dickson D.W. Hutton M. Hardy J. Golde T. Neuron. 2005; 47: 191-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Measurements of Aβ values by sandwich ELISA and in vitro γ-secretase activity assay resulted in minor discrepancies (Figs. 3 and 4). Specifically, sandwich ELISA showed similar levels of Aβ42 in PS1 M146V/+ and M146V/– samples (Fig. 3D), whereas the in vitro γ-secretase activity assay revealed dramatic reduction of Aβ42 upon removal of the wild-type PS1 allele from the PS1 M146V/+ background (M146V/+ versus M146V/–; Fig. 4B). This could be caused by differences of the detection systems. Noticeably, sandwich ELISA measures the steady-state levels of Aβ, whereas the in vitro γ-secretase assay detects the rate of Aβ production. The steady-state Aβ is the net result of production and clearance. It is reasonable to speculate that Aβ42 may have a lower clearance rate, leading to its higher representation measured by sandwich ELISA. Overall, results from both assays demonstrate substantial reduction of Aβ40 production, but not Aβ42, and significant increase in the ratio of Aβ42/Aβ40 as a result of deleting the wild-type PS1 allele. Using APP and N-cadherin CTF as readouts, which serve as substrates for γ-secretase, we show that the PS1 M146V/– mice are less efficient in processing APP and N-cadherin CTFs compared with wild-type or PS1 M146V/+ animals (Fig. 5), and thus exhibiting a partial loss-of-function on total γ-secretase activity. This result, combined with the sandwich ELISA and in vitro γ-secretase activity data, provides strong support for the notion that a reduced γ-secretase processing is the underlying mechanism for the increased Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio and exacerbated amyloid pathology. Nevertheless, an active γ-secretase complex with an imbalance of Aβ40 and Aβ42 species is likely a prerequisite for amyloid pathogenesis, as merely removing one allele of PS1 does not lead to changes in Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio (compare +/– with +/+, Fig. 3) or promote amyloid deposition (41Jankowsky J.L. Slunt H.H. Gonzales V. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Borchelt D.R. Neurobiol. Aging. 2004; 25: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and genetic ablation of PS1 blocks Aβ production and amyloid pathology (36Dewachter I. Reverse D. Caluwaerts N. Ris L. Kuiperi C.

The leading theory of AD, the “amyloid cascade hypothesis,” posits that the generation, aggregation, and/or deposition of Aβ plays a causal role in AD pathogenesis (reviewed in Ref. 42Hardy J. Selkoe D.J. Science. 2002; 297: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (10646) Google Scholar). Because PS1 is indispensable for γ-secretase-dependent Aβ generation, inhibitors of presenilin and γ-secretase are being pursued as a candidate therapy for AD. Our studies reveal a context-dependent effect of partial PS1 inhibition on amyloid pathology. Two important findings are presented: 1) the wild-type PS1 is protective against PS1 FAD mutation-induced amyloid pathogenesis; and 2) this protective effect is mediated through a reduced γ-secretase activity and increased ratio of Aβ42/Aβ40. Our results raise the concern that in the case of PS1 FAD patients or perhaps other undefined pathological conditions, partial inactivation of γ-secretase may lead to exacerbated rather than ameliorated amyloid pathology.

Whether it serves a similar function in vivo is unclear. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, it was previously shown that Δtrx1 Δtrx2 mutants lacking the two genes for cytosolic thioredoxin have a slower growth rate because of a longer S phase, but the basis for S phase elongation was not identified. The hypothesis that S phase protraction was due to inefficient dNTP synthesis was investigated by measuring dNTP levels in asynchronous and synchronized wild-type and Δtrx1 Δtrx2 yeast. In contrast to wild-type cells, Δtrx1 Δtrx2 cells were unable to accumulate or maintain high levels of dNTPs when α-factor- or cdc15-arrested cells were allowed to reenter the cell cycle. At 80 min after release, when the fraction of cells in S phase was maximal, the dNTP pools in Δtrx1 Δtrx2 cells were 60% that of wild-type cells. The data suggest that, in the absence of thioredoxin, cells cannot support the high rate of dNTP synthesis required for efficient DNA synthesis during S phase. The results constitute in vivo evidence for thioredoxin being a physiologically relevant electron donor for ribonucleotide reductase during DNA precursor synthesis.

The results constitute in vivo evidence for thioredoxin being a physiologically relevant electron donor for ribonucleotide reductase during DNA precursor synthesis. Deoxyribonucleotide pools are carefully controlled in all cells to ensure efficient and yet accurate genome replication. The pools are not equimolar, but rather they have a characteristic asymmetry, with dGTP usually the smallest (1Mathews C.K. Ji J. BioEssays. 1992; 14: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). For example, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the dGTP pool is 3-fold smaller than the dTTP pool (2Muller E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24466-24471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Koc A. Wheeler L.J. Mathews C.K. Merrill G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9345-9352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Cells do not stockpile dNTPs, but rather they maintain them at levels just sufficient to support replication. For example, yeast contain fewer than 1.8 × 106 dNTP molecules/cell (3Koc A. Wheeler L.J. Mathews C.K. Merrill G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9345-9352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), which is less than 20% of the amount minimally needed to copy the 1.2 × 107-bp yeast genome. Limiting dNTP pool size is important for replication fidelity. Artificial pool expansion results in increased mutagenesis, perhaps because of stimulation of chain extension from DNA mismatches at high dNTP concentrations (4Wheeler L.J. Rajagopal I. Mathews C.K. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2005; 4: 1450-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The dNTP pools are dynamic, increasing severalfold as eukaryotic cells enter S phase (3Koc A. Wheeler L.J. Mathews C.K. Merrill G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9345-9352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). For dNTP levels to remain elevated during S phase, cells must markedly boost their rate of dNTP synthesis to compensate for the rapid consumption of dNTPs at replication forks. Replicating cells are exquisitely sensitive to dNTP depletion. When dNTP synthesis is blocked by the addition of hydroxyurea, replication stops well before any dNTP pool is exhausted (5Koc A. Wheeler L.J. Mathews C.K. Merrill G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 223-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Presumably, cells have evolved the mechanisms to limit dNTP accumulation to support replication fidelity and yet maintain dNTP levels above the minima required for efficient DNA replication and repair.A central enzyme controlling the rate of dNTP synthesis is ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), 3The abbreviations used are: RNR, ribonucleotide reductase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline.3The abbreviations used are: RNR, ribonucleotide reductase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. a heterotetramer of two large and two small subunits. The enzyme is subject to extraordinary regulation. Its activity and substrate specificity are regulated by binding of different nucleoside triphosphates to two allosteric sites on the large subunit, thus preventing dNTP over-accumulation and achieving an optimal ratio of the four deoxyribonucleotides. In many eukaryotic cells, the large subunit genes are induced severalfold at late G1/early S phase of the cell cycle (6Lowndes N.F. Johnson A.L. Johnston L.H. Nature. 1991; 350: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 7Lowndes N.F. McInerny C.J. Johnson A.L. Fantes P.A. Johnston L.H. Nature. 1992; 355: 449-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), presumably to boost RNR protein levels and support a higher rate of dNTP synthesis during S phase. In addition to allosteric and transcriptional control, RNR is bound and inhibited by Sml1, a protein phosphorylated and inactivated by the CHK1/RAD53/MEC1 pathway in response to DNA damage or S phase entry (8Chabes A. Georgieva B. Domkin V. Zhao X. Rothstein R. Thelander L. Cell. 2003; 112: 391-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Most recently, RNR activity has been shown to be regulated by subunit compartmentation (9Yao R. Zhang Z. An X. Bucci B. Perlstein D.L. Stubbe J. Huang M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6628-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 10Zhang Z. An X. Yang K. Perlstein D.L. Hicks L. Kelleher N. Stubbe J. Huang M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 1422-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Only during S phase or in response to DNA damage does the small subunit move from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where it can join the large subunit and reconstitute holoenzyme (9Yao R. Zhang Z. An X. Bucci B. Perlstein D.L. Stubbe J. Huang M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6628-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Together, allosteric regulation, transcriptional control, negative-acting regulatory proteins, and subunit localization converge to regulate RNR activity and ensure that cells maintain dNTPs at levels needed for efficient and yet accurate DNA synthesis.Despite its central role in dNTP synthesis, the identity of the physiological electron donor used by RNR for ribonucleotide reduction is still conjectural. Both thioredoxin and glutaredoxin can support the RNR reaction in vitro, but it is not clear whether both or either protein serves as the major reductant in vivo. In yeast, the two systems complement an essential process, as mutants lacking either thioredoxin or glutathione reductase are viable, but mutants lacking both thioredoxin and glutathione reductase are not (11Muller E.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1805-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 12Draculic T. Dawes I.W. Grant C.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 1167-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). It is not known whether the essential process affected by thioredoxin and glutathione reductase deletion is ribonucleotide reduction, but as RNR is essential, it is clear that alternative systems can supply electrons to RNR in cells lacking either thioredoxin or glutathione reductase. Further complicating the problem of identifying the physiological electron donor, cells lacking an intact thioredoxin system often exhibit compensatory changes in gene expression and metabolite levels. For example, Δtrr1 yeast lacking thioredoxin reductase have 3-fold higher glutathione levels (13Merwin J.R. Mustacich D.J. Muller E.G. Pearson G.D. Merrill G.F. Carcinogenesis. 2002; 23: 1609-1615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and significantly higher levels of transcripts encoding glutathione reductase (Glr1), glutamate cysteine ligase (Gsh1), and glutathione synthase (Gsh2) (14Carmel-Harel O. Stearman R. Gasch A.P. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Storz G. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Also, Northern blot results show that Δtrx1 Δtrx2 cells lacking thioredoxin have significantly higher levels of the mRNAs encoding the large and small RNR subunits (Rnr1, Rnr3, and Rnr2) (2Muller E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24466-24471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that in the absence of an intact thioredoxin system, normal RNR levels may not be sufficient to meet the demands of the replication forks for DNA precursors and that induction of the RNR genes may be an adaptive response. Compensatory effects of glutathione system ablation on thioredoxin system proteins or RNR levels have not been reported. Nor have compensatory effects of thioredoxin or glutathione system ablation been investigated in higher eukaryotes.In yeast, deletion of the two genes encoding cytosolic thioredoxin (TRX1 and TRX2) results in slower growth, which is due exclusively to an elongated S phase (15Muller E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9194-9202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The possibility that impaired ribonucleotide reduction was responsible for S phase protraction was investigated by measuring the dNTP pools in asynchronously growing wild-type yeast and Δtrx1 Δtrx2 double mutants lacking thioredoxin. The asynchronous cell measurements indicated that, rather than being depressed in the double mutant, dNTP levels were actually elevated, and it was concluded that thioredoxin is required for an S phase function other than ribonucleotide reduction (2Muller E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24466-24471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, we and others have shown that dNTP levels are not static during the yeast cell cycle (3Koc A. Wheeler L.J. Mathews C.K. Merrill G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9345-9352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 8Chabes A. Georgieva B. Domkin V. Zhao X. Rothstein R. Thelander L. Cell. 2003; 112: 391-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). The dNTP pools increase about 5-fold when cells are released from an α-factor-induced G1 arrest and enter S phase (3Koc A. Wheeler L.J. Mathews C.K. Merrill G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9345-9352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The increase in dNTP levels during S phase is particularly remarkable when one considers that dNTPs are rapidly being consumed by replication forks in S phase cells. Thus, only during S phase, when there is a high flux of substrate through RNR, may a deficiency in dNTP synthesis imposed by thioredoxin deletion be observed. Unable to make dNTPs at a sufficiently fast rate, Δtrx1 Δtrx2 cells may require more time to complete replication, leading to the observed elongation of S phase. To investigate this explanation for S phase protraction, we measured dNTP levels in wild-type and Δtrx1 Δtrx2 yeast that were synchronized using α-factor or a temperature-sensitive cdc15 mutation. Using both synchrony methods, we found that yeast lacking thioredoxin had significantly lower dNTP levels during S phase. The results are consistent with the conclusion that S phase protraction in cells lacking thioredoxin is due to a deficiency in dNTP synthesis and supports the idea that thioredoxin is the physiologically relevant RNR reductant in eukaryotes.MATERIALS AND METHODSStrains, Media, and Cell Synchrony—Standard yeast genetic methods were used for the analysis of strains and crosses (16Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). Cells were grown in YEPD (2% bacto-yeast extract, 2% bacto-peptone, 2% glucose). Unless specified otherwise, cells were grown at 25 °C. The strains used are listed in Table 1. SY2626 is a W303 derivative that carries a bar1 mutation to facilitate α-factor synchronization. MY326 is a derivative of EMY56-5D. MY401, MY403, MY404, and MY405 were derived by mating MY326 to SY2626 and isolating appropriate segregants. MY445 was derived by mating SSC18 (17Price C. Nasmyth K.

Arrested cells, collected either by filtration or centrifugation (5 min at 1000 rpm), were washed once with fresh YEPD, once with 100% conditioned YEPD, and resuspended in 25% conditioned YEPD. Conditioned YEPD was prepared by growing W303-1a cells to saturation in YEPD and removing the cells by filtration. For cdc15 synchronization, exponentially growing cdc15 cells were incubated at the nonpermissive temperature (37 °C) for 3.75 h. Arrested cells were released to the permissive temperature by adding an equal volume of 15 °C medium and incubating cells at 25 °C.Flow Cytometry—Culture aliquots containing ∼5 × 106 cells were mixed with 2 volumes of 95% ethanol and fixed for at least 15 min at 25 °C or overnight at 4 °C. After microcentrifugation (6 s at 10,000 rpm), cell pellets were washed with 100 μl of 50 mm sodium citrate buffer (pH 7), resuspended in 100 μl of sodium citrate buffer and sonicated on ice for 6 s at 10 watts using a Fisher Scientific 60 Sonic Dismembrator. After a 1-h incubation at 37 °C with RNase A (0.25 mg/ml) and a 1-h incubation at 55 °C with proteinase K (1 μg/ml), 100 μl of sodium citrate buffer containing 16 μg/ml propidium iodide was added, and samples were incubated overnight in the dark at 4 °C. A Beckman Coulter Epics XL flow cytometer (Hialeah, FL) and WinList software (Verity Software House, Topsham, ME) were used to analyze the samples. For each sample, 25,000 events were assayed. To determine the percentage of cells in each cell cycle phase, histograms were analyzed using MultiCycle software (Phoenix Flow Systems, San Diego, CA), and the G2 and G1 peaks were corrected by subtracting the number of binucleated cells (determined by microscopy, as described below) from the G2 peak and adding twice this number to the G1 peak.For microscopy and budding index determination, ∼5 × 106 cells were fixed in ethanol as described above, microcentrifuged, resuspended in PBS (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl), microcentrifuged, and resuspended in 50 μl of PBS containing 1 μg/ml Hoechst 33258 and a 1:100 dilution of Alexa Fluor 488-phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). After 10 min, cells were diluted with 400 μl of PBS, microcentrifuged and washed twice with 400 μl of PBS, and resuspended in 50 μl of PBS containing 50% glycerol. Cells were examined using a Zeiss Axiovert S100TV fluorescence microscope with ×100 objective and zoom set at ×0.63, and CoolSNAP HQ charge-coupled device camera. For each sample, multiple fields were photographed using Nomarski optics and fluorescence (480ex/535em filter for phalloidin staining of f-actin and 360ex/460em filter for Hoechst staining of DNA). Photographs were analyzed using MetaMorph software (Universal Imaging, Philadelphia) and scored for budded and unbudded cells and nuclear morphology. Fields totaling at least 50 cells were scored in triplicate for each sample.Dexoxyribonucleoside Triphosphate Pool Measurements—Approximately 3 × 108 cells were harvested by centrifugation (5 min at 1000 rpm), and nucleotide extracts were prepared either by the trichloroacetic acid extraction and Freon-amine neutralization method (2Muller E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24466-24471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or by an adaptation of the methanol extraction and boiling method (20Song S. Pursell Z.F. Copeland W.C. Longley M.J. Kunkel T.A. Mathews C.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 4990-4995Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The latter involved resuspending harvested cells in 60% cold methanol, vortexing suspensions 10 times for 30 s during a 2-h incubation on ice, boiling samples for 3 min, and clarifying extracts by centrifugation (20 min at 12,000 × g). Extracts were dried using a Savant SpeedVac Concentrator (Thermo Electron Corp., East Greenbush, NY), and the residue was resuspended in 200 μl of cold deionized H2O and assayed for each of the four dNTPs by the DNA polymerase-based enzymatic method (21Sherman P.A. Fyfe J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 180: 222-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Cell volume was determined from A600, where 1 absorbance unit of cell suspension was empirically determined to correspond to 1 μl of cell volume.RESULTSThioredoxin Deletion Results in an Elongated S Phase in Several Genetic Backgrounds—It was previously shown that deletion of the TRX1 and TRX2 genes encoding cytosolic thioredoxin results in S phase protraction in yeast (15Muller E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9194-9202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, deletion of the GLR1 gene encoding glutathione reductase has no effect on S phase length, even though it results in a severe (27-fold) increase in the GSSG:GSH ratio (11Muller E.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1805-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). To confirm these earlier findings and extend them to strains carrying mutations that facilitate cell synchronization, we used flow cytometry to determine the DNA profile of asynchronously growing bar1 yeast, which lack the protease that degrades α-factor, and cdc15 yeast, which arrest at M/G1 at the nonpermissive temperature. Fig. 1, A–C, shows that bar1 yeast carrying a Δtrx1 deletion mutation (strain MY403) or a Δtrx2 deletion mutation (strain MY404) had DNA profiles similar to isogenic wild-type yeast (strain MY401). In all three strains, as well as in wild-type strain SY2626 (data not shown), most of the cells in the asynchronously growing population had either a 1N or 2N DNA content, where N refers to one genome equivalent of DNA. In contrast, Fig. 1D shows that bar1 yeast carrying a Δtrx1 Δtrx2 double deletion mutation (strain MY405) had a higher fraction of cells with an intermediate DNA content, indicative of an elongated S phase. Fig. 1, E–F, shows that S phase protraction was also observed in cdc15 yeast lacking thioredoxin (compare Δtrx1 Δtrx2 strain MY445 with isogenic wild-type strain SSC18). In contrast, Fig. 1, G–H, shows that S phase protraction was not observed in cdc15 yeast lacking glutathione reductase (compare Δglr1 strain MY443 with isogenic wild-type strain MY442). These results confirm earlier findings that disruption of the thioredoxin system, but not the glutathione system, results in S phase protraction in budding yeast.Note that the fraction of cells in the G1, S, and G2/M phases cannot be directly determined from the DNA profiles shown in Fig. 1. Microscopy showed that a significant number of the cells in the populations were binucleated doublets because of a lag between mitotic division and cell separation. For example, 15% of the SSC18 population and 9% of the MY445 population were binucleated doublets. These doublets would register as having a 2N DNA content during flow cytometry, when actually they represented two G1 cells. Taking the G1 cell doublets into account, the fractions of cells in G1, S, and G2/M were 0.31, 0.26, and 0.43 for wild-type strain SSC18, and 0.15, 0.51 and 0.34 for Δtrx1 Δtrx2 strain MY445. The proportion of cells in a given phase of the cell cycle is related to the length of the time spent in that phase (22Slater M.L. Sharrow S.O. Gart J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 3850-3854Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Given the 140-min generation time of SSC18 and the 190-min generation time of MY445, the calculated lengths of the G1, S, and G2/M phases were 43, 36, and 60 min for SSC18, and 29, 97, and 65 min for MY445. Thus, the 50-min-longer generation time of the Δtrx1 Δtrx2 strain was due to a 61-min-longer S phase, which was partially compensated for by a 14-min-shorter G1 phase. A similar 2.7-fold protraction of S phase was observed in bar1 Δtrx1 Δtrx2 strain MY405 (data not shown) and in Δtrx1 Δtrx2 strains EMY21–8D (15Muller E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9194-9202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and EMY63 (11Muller E.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1805-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar).From the data shown in Fig. 1, we conclude that S phase was protracted in bar1 and cdc15 strains carrying the Δtrx1 Δtrx2 double deletion mutation but not in strains carrying Δtrx1, Δtrx2 or Δglr1 single deletion mutations. Therefore, in investigating whether S phase protraction is associated with a deficiency in dNTP synthesis, we confined our comparisons to wild-type and Δtrx1 Δtrx2 strains.α-Factor-synchronized Yeast Lacking Thioredoxin Fail to Accumulate dNTPs at Late G1/Early S Phase—Given that thioredoxin can serve as the electron donor for ribonucleotide reduction by RNR in vitro (23Laurent T.C. Moore E.C. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 3436-3444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that yeast must maintain dNTPs above a critical threshold to prevent replication arrest (5Koc A. Wheeler L.J. Mathews C.K. Merrill G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 223-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), one explanation for S phase protraction in Δtrx1 Δtrx2 yeast would be that dNTP synthesis was impaired. Muller (2Muller E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24466-24471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) investigated this explanation by measuring dNTP levels in asynchronously growing wild-type and Δtrx1 Δtrx2 cells and found that dNTP pools were not repressed and in fact were ∼40% higher in Δtrx1 Δtrx2 cells. The result suggested that S phase protraction in Δtrx1 Δtrx2 cells was not due to a deficiency in dNTP synthesis. However, having shown that dNTP levels oscillate during the cell cycle, reaching maximal levels at late G1/early S (3Koc A. Wheeler L.J. Mathews C.K. Merrill G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9345-9352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), we reasoned that a deficiency in dNTP synthesis in Δtrx1 Δtrx2 cells may be observed only during S phase, when the demand for dNTPs was highest. To investigate this possibility, we measured dNTP levels during the cell cycle in yeast synchronized by α-factor block and release.Fig. 2A shows DNA profiles of wild-type and Δtrx1 Δtrx2 cells synchronized by α-factor block and release. Both cell types arrested with a 1N complement of DNA when incubated for 3 h with α-factor, and both cell types began to accumulate DNA about 40 min after α-factor was removed. Microscopy confirmed that >95% of the cells were unbudded and had acquired the characteristic “schmooed” morphology during the 3-h incubation with α-factor and that bud emergence began about 40 min after α-factor release (data not shown). The flow cytometry and microscopy results indicated that wild-type and Δtrx1 Δtrx2 cells collected in G1 during the α-factor block and began entering S phase about 40 min after α-factor release. Although wild-type and Δtrx1 Δtrx2 cells entered S phase with the same kinetics, Δtrx1 Δtrx2 cells traversed S phase more slowly. As a result, emergence of a new G1 peak was not observed until 140 min after pheromone removal in Δtrx1 Δtrx2 cells.FIGURE 2Deoxyribonucleotide levels in α-factor-synchronized wild-type and Δtrx1 Δtrx2 yeast. α-Factor-sensitive bar1 yeast that were wild type for thioredoxin (strain SY2626) or Δtrx1 Δtrx2 deletion mutants (strain MY405) were used. Yeast that were growing asynchronously (a), were arrested in G1 by a 3-h incubation in 100 ng/ml α-factor (0), or were released from α-factor for the indicated number of minutes were fixed for flow cytometric analysis of DNA content (A) or extracted by the trichloroacetic acid-Freon-amine method for analysis of dNTP levels (B).

Consistent with previous findings (2Muller E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24466-24471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), dNTP levels in asynchronous Δtrx1 Δtrx2 cells (84 μm for dTTP, 48 μm for dATP, 25 μm for dCTP, and 12 μm for dGTP) were not lower and in fact were about 60% higher than in wild type cells (53 μm for dTTP, 24 μm for dATP, 17 μm for dCTP, and 8 μm for dGTP) (Fig. 2B, compare black and gray“a” time point histograms). Also consistent with previous findings (3Koc A. Wheeler L.J. Mathews C.K. Merrill G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9345-9352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), the dNTP pools decreased to less than half of asynchronous cell levels when wild-type cells were arrested in G1 with α-factor. A much smaller decrease in dNTP levels was observed when Δtrx1 Δtrx2 cells were arrested in G1 with α-factor (Fig. 2B, compare black and gray“0” time point histograms). As a result of higher initial asynchronous levels and the smaller decrease after incubation with α-factor, the dNTP pools in α-factor-arrested Δtrx1 Δtrx2 cells (65 μm for dTTP, 21 μm for dATP, 22 μm for dCTP, and 10 μm for dGTP) were about 3-fold higher than in α-factor-arrested wild-type cells (24 μm for dTTP, 8 μm for dATP, 8 μm for dCTP, and 3 μm for dGTP). Consistent with previous findings (3Koc A. Wheeler L.J. Mathews C.K. Merrill G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9345-9352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), when wild-type cells were released from α-factor, dNTP levels increased about 5-fold as cells approached and entered S phase. In contrast, when Δtrx1 Δtrx2 cells were released fromα-factor, dNTP levels increased very little as cells approached S phase and in fact decreased as cells entered S phase. Thus, at 80 min after α-factor release, when flow cytometry indicated that most cells were in S phase, dNTP levels in Δtrx1 Δtrx2 cells (63 μm for dTTP, 14 μm for dATP, 19 μm for dCTP, and 11 μm for dGTP) were on average about 60% of wild-type levels (108 μm for dTTP, 28 μm for dATP, 45 μm for dCTP, and 14 μm for dGTP). The results suggested that in the absence of thioredoxin, cells were not able to accumulate dNTPs in late G1 and were not able to maintain dNTPs once S phase began. Previous hydroxyurea experiments have shown that a relatively small perturbation of S phase dNTP levels can elicit a complete replication block (5Koc A. Wheeler L.J. Mathews C.K. Merrill G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 223-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Thus, the 40% decrease in S phase dNTP levels observed in Δtrx1 Δtrx2 cells likely would have an inhibitory effect on replication efficiency. Given that increased dNTP synthesis would require inc"

GDH transgenic mice were generated to express the human GDH-HI H454Y mutation and human wild-type GDH in islets driven by the rat insulin promoter. H454Y transgene expression was confirmed by increased GDH enzyme activity in islets and decreased sensitivity to GTP inhibition. The H454Y GDH transgenic mice had hypoglycemia with normal growth rates. H454Y GDH transgenic islets were more sensitive to leucine- and glutamine-stimulated insulin secretion but had decreased response to glucose stimulation. The fluxes via GDH and glutaminase were measured by tracing 15N flux from [2-15N]glutamine. The H454Y transgene in islets had higher insulin secretion in response to glutamine alone and had 2-fold greater GDH flux. High glucose inhibited both glutaminase and GDH flux, and leucine could not override this inhibition. 15NH4Cl tracing studies showed 15N was not incorporated into glutamate in either H454Y transgenic or normal islets. In conclusion, we generated a GDH-HI disease mouse model that has a hypoglycemia phenotype and confirmed that the mutation of H454Y is disease causing. Stimulation of insulin release by the H454Y GDH mutation or by leucine activation is associated with increased oxidative deamination of glutamate via GDH. This study suggests that GDH functions predominantly in the direction of glutamate oxidation rather than glutamate synthesis in mouse islets and that this flux is tightly controlled by glucose.

Although the biochemical mechanisms of short-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase-HI are unknown, this disorder provides evidence of a role for fatty acid metabolism in insulin secretion.

Specific expression of the GDH H454Y mutation in β-cell was employed to improve our understanding of the role of GDH in both amino acid- and glucose-stimulated insulin secretions. Generation of Transgenic Mice—Two constructs were designed and were identical with the exception of a 1-nucleotide base change that either preserved the wild-type human GDH sequence or caused the H454Y mutation in GDH. The construct used the rat insulin promoter (obtained from Dr. Mark A. Magnuson) to drive β-cell-specific transcription of the human GDH cDNA sequence. The human growth hormone (huGH) genomic DNA sequence (received from Dr. Mark A. Magnuson) was used to stabilize the construct. The constructs were microinjected into fertilized eggs of B6SJLF1 mice, and the eggs were then transferred into the oviducts of pseudopregnant females (Transgenic & Chimeric Mouse Facility, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine). The resulting offspring were genotyped by PCR using specifically designed primers (described below), which targeted the transgene, the transgene insert was sequenced to confirm completeness, and the offspring were crossed with C57BL/6 mice. F1 offspring were genotyped by the same method and founder lines chosen. DNA Analysis—Mouse-tail DNA was extracted by phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (1:1:24). PCR analysis was performed using primers that flanked the GDH-huGH junction of the transgene (5′-GCGCACAGCCATGAAGTA-3′) and (5′-AGAGCAAGAGGCCAGCAC-3′), as well as with a separate set that amplified only within huGH (5′-TTCATTTCCCCTCGTGAATC-3′) and (5′-GTGAAACCCCGTCTCTACA-3′). The entire construct was sequenced using overlapping primer sets (sequences available upon request). Blood Glucose and Weight Comparisons—Mice were weighed and blood glucose was measured monthly from 4 to 20 weeks after birth to obtain data on 20 mice (10 males, 10 females) from each transgenic line and their corresponding normal littermates. Mouse Islet Preparation and Insulin Secretion—Islets were isolated by collagenase digestion and cultured with 10 mm glucose in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) for 3 to 4 days. The culture medium was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 100 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and islets were incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2/95% air, humidified incubator. 100 islets were loaded onto nylon filters in a small chamber and perifused in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (KRBB) (115 mmol/liter NaCl, 24 mmol/liter NaHCO3, 5 mmol/liter KCl, 1 mmol/liter MgCl2, 2.5 mmol/liter CaCl2, 10 mmol/liter HEPES, pH 7.4) with 0.25% bovine serum albumin at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. Perifusate solutions were gassed with 95% O2/5% CO2 and maintained at 37 °C. Samples were collected every minute for insulin assay. Insulin was measured by radioimmunoassay. GDH Enzyme Assay—Islets were isolated from individual mice and then homogenized in 100 μl phosphate homogenization buffer (20 mm phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.2). GDH activity measurements were carried out with an enhanced fluorescence method described previously (20Passonneau J.V. Lowry O.H. Enzymatic Analysis, A Practical Guide.1st Ed. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1993Crossref Google Scholar). The reaction buffer contained 35 mm imidazole base, 15 mm imidazole HCl, 100 μm NADH, 2 mm α-ketoglutarate, 25 mm ammonium acetate, pH 7.4. An aliquot of islet extract was added to start the reaction, which proceeded for 60 min at room temperature in a final volume of 100 μl. 200 μm ADP was included in the reaction to give the maximum GDH activity. Different concentrations of GTP were added to determine the GTP inhibition curve. The reaction was terminated by adding 10 μl of 1 n HCl and incubated at room temperature for 10 min to destroy excess NADH. 1 ml of 6 n sodium hydroxide and 10 mm imidazole base was then added and incubated for 20 min at 60 °C. After samples cooled to room temperature, they were read on a fluorometer (Perkin Elmer Wallac Victor2). Control experiments with purified H454Y huGDH used a preparation of enzyme expressed in Escherichia coli as described previously (13Fang J. Hsu B.Y. MacMullen C.M. Poncz M. Smith T.J. Stanley C.A. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 81-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Cytosolic Free Ca2+ Measurement—Islets were isolated and cultured on poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips under the same condition as described above. Perifusion procedures and cytosolic-free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) measurements were described previously (15Gao Z.Y. Li G. Najafi H. Wolf B.A. Matschinsky F.M.

After incubation with fura-2 acetoxymethylester (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), islets were perifused with KRBB at 37 °C at a flow rate of 2 ml/min, while various treatments were applied. [Ca2+]i was measured every 10 s by dual wave length fluorescence microscope (Attofluor). ATP and ATP/ADP Ratio Assays—Batches of 100 cultured islets were preincubated with glucose-free KRBB for 60 min, then submitted to different treatments for another 60 min, including exposure to 10 mm glutamine and a 4 mm physiological amino acids mixture (AAM, 3.5 mm of 18 amino acids plus 0.5 mm glutamine). The composition of the AAM (21Li C. Buettger C. Kwagh J. Matter A. Daikhin Y. Nissim I.B. Collins H.W. Yudkoff M. Stanley C.A. Matschinsky F.M. J. Biol.

The ATP/ADP ratio was measured following published procedures (20Passonneau J.V. Lowry O.H. Enzymatic Analysis, A Practical Guide.1st Ed. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1993Crossref Google Scholar); in brief, ADP was converted to ATP by pyruvate kinase using phosphoenol pyruvate as substrate, and the ATP/ADP ratio was calculated by the luminescence reading in the absence of pyruvate kinase (ATP) and the difference that was recorded in the absence and presence of pyruvate kinase (ADP). Studies with [2-15N]Glutamine in Isolated Islets—Batches of 1,000 cultured islets were preincubated with unlabeled 10 mm glutamine in KRBB for 60 min at 37 °C, then incubated with different treatments for another 60 min, in 10 mm [2-15N]glutamine (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc., Andover, MA). In addition to the control condition, islets were incubated with 10 mm leucine, 25 mm glucose, and the combination of 10 mm leucine and 25 mm glucose (10 mm leucine/25 mm glucose). After incubation, the supernatant was used to determine total ammonia, insulin, and [15N]ammonia enrichment. 200 μl of 6% perchloric acid was added to the islet pellet, homogenized, then neutralized to pH 7.0 with 1 m K2CO3 and centrifuged to remove potassium perchlorate precipitate. The supernatant was then used for determination of amino acid concentrations as well as 15N enrichments. Details on the analysis of amino acids, ammonia, and 15N enrichments (atom percent excess, APE) were described previously (16Li C. Najafi H. Daikhin Y. Nissim I.B. Collins H.W. Yudkoff M.

Studies with 15NH4Cl—Batches of 1,000 cultured islets were preincubated with glucose-free KRBB for 60 min, then incubated with 300 μm 15NH4Cl (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc.) for another 120 min; in addition, islets were incubated with 10 mm 2-amino-2-norbornane carboxylic acid (BCH), 25 mm glucose and the combination of 10 mm BCH and 25 mm glucose (10 mm BCH/25 mm glucose). After incubation, the supernatant was used to measure total ammonia, insulin, and the amino acid concentrations. The perchloric acid extract of the islets was then used for determination of amino acid concentrations as well as 15N enrichments. Materials—All chemicals were from Sigma except those indicated otherwise. Data Analysis—All data are presented as mean ± S.E. Student t tests were performed when two groups were compared. One-way analysis of variances was used, followed by the Bonferroni test when multiple groups were compared. Survival rates of mice were compared using χ2. Differences were considered significant when p < 0.05. The determination of the threshold for a rise in insulin secretion during a ramp perifusion design was described previously (16Li C. Najafi H.

Calculations of Stable Isotope Studies—The accumulation of 15N-labled metabolites was calculated as the product of their isotopic enrichment (APE) multiplied by concentration (nmol/1,000 islets). NH4+ production (PNH4+) was calculated according to the equation: PNH4+=TotalNH4+−BlankNH4+. Flux through GDH was calculated from total NH4+ and 15N enrichment and also included the unlabeled glutamate and aspartate pools, according to the equation: FluxviaGDH=[(totalNH4+)(APENH4+)(0.01)]/[(APEGlu+APEAsp)(0.5)]. The sum of GDH flux plus the concentrations of [15N]aspartate and [15N]glutamate provided a measure of flux through phosphate-dependent glutaminase (PDG). Generation of Transgenic Mice Expressing H454Y huGDH—Two lines of H454Y huGDH, TG-1 and TG-2, and one line of wild-type huGDH transgenic mice were generated. All three lines of transgenic animals yielded normal litter sizes. As shown in Fig. 1, body weights for both male and female mutant and wild-type huGDH transgenic mice were similar to those of their littermates. Random blood glucose concentrations were consistently lower in TG-1 mice after 12 weeks of age compared with controls (Fig. 1). TG-2 mice had low blood glucose concentrations by 4 weeks of age and were more severely hypoglycemic than TG1 mice. Hypoglycemia presumably impaired survival of both TG1 and TG2 lines compared with wild type. At 1 month, survival was 35% in TG1 and 33% in TG2 compared with 49% in wild-type and normal littermates (p < 0.01). At 4 months, survival rates were similar in TG1 and wild-type lines but further declined to 26% in TG2 (versus TG1, p < 0.05). Because of persistent hypoglycemia, both H454Y huGDH transgenic lines were difficult to breed. This was particularly true for TG2 mice, and only a limited number of studies could be carried out in this line before it could no longer be maintained. Mutant huGDH Enzyme Activity in Islets—To demonstrate that the huGDH transgenes were expressed in islets, GDH enzyme activity and sensitivity to inhibition by GTP were measured in homogenates of isolated islets from the three transgenic lines. Assays were done in the presence of 200 μm ADP to achieve maximal basal GDH activity and avoid possible influences of allosteric effectors carried over in the preparation of tissues. Results of measurements of enzyme activities in homogenates of whole pancreas were not different between controls and the transgenic lines (data not shown). As shown in Table 1, total GDH activity in isolated islets was slightly increased in wild-type huGDH transgenic mice but was increased to two times that of normal controls in TG1 and to three times normal in TG2 mice indicating high levels of transgene expression in these two lines. Fig. 2 compares the GTP inhibition curves for GDH enzyme activity in islets from the transgenic lines and control mice. For comparison, the inhibition curve for purified H454Y huGDH is also shown. Inhibition of GDH enzyme activity by GTP in islets from wild-type huGDH transgenic mice was similar to that of normal control mice. In contrast, islet GDH from TG1 showed a right shift in the GTP inhibition curve with ∼10% of total activity uninhibitable at 100 μm GTP. In the more severely affected TG2 transgenic mice, the GTP inhibition curve was shifted even further to the right very close to that of purified H454Y huGDH and about 45% of the total activity was uninhibited by 100 μm GTP. These results demonstrated that the mutant H454Y huGDH transgene was highly expressed in islets from the TG1 line and that expression was even greater in the TG2 line.TABLE 1Maximal GDH activity in normal and transgenic isletsn = 4GDH activitypmol/islet/minNormal14 ± 1Wild type17 ± 3TG133 ± 5aVersus normal, p < 0.05.,bVersus wild type, p < 0.05.TG246 ± 2cVersus normal, p < 0.01.,dVersus wild type, p < 0.01.,eVersus TG1, p < 0.05.a Versus normal, p < 0.05.b Versus wild type, p < 0.05.c Versus normal, p < 0.01.d Versus wild type, p < 0.01.e Versus TG1, p < 0.05. Open table in a new tab Glucose- and Leucine-stimulated Insulin Secretion—Fig. 3 shows the responses of isolated islets from the mutant H454Y huGDH transgenic mice to glucose and leucine stimulation. As shown in A, base-line insulin secretion in TG1 mouse islets was initially elevated compared with normal control islets (0.9 ± 0.04 ng/100 islets/min versus 0.4 ± 0.003 ng/100 islets/min, p < 0.001) and declined close to that of normal after 50 min of glucose- and amino acid-free perifusion. The threshold for GSIS was higher in TG1 islets than control islets (10 versus 6mm), and total GSIS was significantly lower than controls in the time interval of 50–100 min (116 ± 3 versus 87 ± 6 ng/100 islets, p < 0.05). The response to glucose ramp stimulation was similar in wild-type huGDH transgenic and normal mouse islets (data not shown). Fig. 3B shows the response of TG1 islets to leucine ramp stimulation. Glutamine (2 mm) further enhanced insulin secretion in TG1 islets (4.4 ± 0.1 versus 0.9 ± 0.04 ng/100 islets/min, p < 0.01). TG1 islets were more sensitive than control islets to leucine ramp stimulation (threshold: 1 versus 4 mm). After subtracting base-line insulin release, total insulin secretion in TG1 islets during the period from 50 min to 100 min was not significantly different from normal islets (314 ± 124 ng/100 islets versus 169 ± 42 ng/100 islets, p > 0.05). The insulin responses to depolarization with KCl were not different in islets from the TG1 line compared with islets from control littermates. Wild-type transgenic mouse islets showed responses to leucine ramp stimulation similar to that of normal mouse islets (data not shown). Glutamine, AAM-stimulated Insulin Secretion, and Intracellular Calcium Responses—Since 2 mm glutamine appeared to cause an increase in base-line insulin secretion in islets from the H454Y huGDH transgenic mice but not from control littermates (Fig. 3), we examined the responses to a glutamine ramp alone. As shown in Fig. 4A, both TG1 and TG2 islets responded to glutamine ramp stimulation. In contrast, there was no response to glutamine alone by islets from normal mice and from wild-type huGDH transgenic mice (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 4A, TG2 islets were more sensitive to glutamine than TG1 islets, a finding consistent with the enzymatic data showing that GDH from TG2 islets was less sensitive to GTP inhibition than GDH from TG1 islets. Inhibition of glutaminase by 6-diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine (DON), the enzyme responsible for deamination of glutamine to glutamate, completely abolished TG1 islet responsiveness to glutamine stimulation. As shown in Fig. 4B, TG1 islets had enhanced insulin release in response to exposure of a complete mixture of amino acids, whereas islets from control littermates was insensitive to an amino acid ramp. The maximum insulin release by TG1 islets caused by the AAM stimulation was similar to that achieved by glutamine alone, suggesting that glutamine was responsible for most of the effect of the mixture of amino acids. To confirm the above observations, the response of islet intracellular calcium concentrations ([Ca2+]i) to glutamine was measured dynamically by fluorescent microscopy. As shown in Fig. 5A, 10 mm glutamine alone caused an increase of [Ca2+]i in TG2 islets but not in normal control islets. DON at 40 μm totally blocked this effect of glutamine. Similar results were obtained with islets from TG1 mice (B). These observations confirm that the stimulatory effect of glutamine on islets expressing the H454Y huGDH transgene depends on its conversion to glutamate, which can then be used as substrate for oxidation via GDH. Changes of the ATP/ADP Ratio and Insulin Release—To directly assess the effect of the H454Y mutation on high energy phosphate generation in islets, we measured the ATP/ADP ratios and insulin release in batches of TG1 and control islets incubated for periods of 1 h (n = 6). In the absence of added substrates, TG1 islets had an increased basal ATP/ADP ratio (4.4 ± 0.4 versus 2.8 ± 0.2, p < 0.05) and also showed a slightly increased basal insulin secretion (77 ± 26 versus 59 ± 13 ng/100 islets/h, not significant). In the presence of 10 mm glutamine, compared with control islets, TG1 islets also had a higher ATP/ADP ratio (5.3 ± 0.3 versus 3.3 ± 0.4, p < 0.05) and increased insulin release (350 ± 24 versus 109 ± 33 ng/100 islets/h, p < 0.05). Exposure to the 4 mm AAM also stimulated insulin release in TG1 more effectively than in control islets (180 ± 22 versus 89 ± 33 ng/100 islets/h, p < 0.05) and resulted in a trend toward a higher ATP/ADP ratio (3.7 ± 0.5 versus 2.8 ± 0.6, not significant). Insulin content was similar in TG1 and control islets. These results are consistent with the concept that the H454Y gain of function mutation of GDH stimulates insulin release by increased oxidative flux through the enzyme generating elevated ratios of ATP to ADP both in the basal state and when exposed to the substrate precursor of the enzyme, glutamine. [2-15N]Glutamine Tracer Studies—The above studies suggested that the H454Y huGDH gain of function mutation enhances insulin release by stimulating glutaminolysis (glutamine → glutamate → α-ketoglutarate) thus increasing flux into the tricarboxylic acid cycle. To directly examine the effects of the mutation on flux through GDH, stable isotope studies were carried out using [2-15N]glutamine to trace its conversion to [2-15N]glutamate via glutaminase and subsequently to [15N]ammonia via deamination of glutamate in the GDH reaction. As shown in Table 2, in the presence of 10 mm [2-15N]glutamine, basal insulin secretion, ammonia production, [15N]ammonia APE, and flux through GDH and glutaminase were all greater in islets from TG1 mice compared with normal mouse islets. In control islets, 10 mm leucine induced a 12-fold increase in insulin release, accompanied by increased rates of ammonia production and a 3-fold stimulation of flux through GDH. Leucine increased rates of insulin secretion and ammonia production in TG1 islets to approximately the same levels as in controls, suggesting that these values were close to maximal. Note that flu"

In human airway smooth muscle (HASM) cells, the expression and function of CD38 are augmented by the inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), leading to increased intracellular calcium response to agonists. A glucocorticoid response element in the CD38 gene has been computationally described, providing evidence for transcriptional regulation of its expression. In the present study, we investigated the effects of dexamethasone, a glucocorticoid, on CD38 expression and ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity in HASM cells stimulated with TNF-alpha. In HASM cells, TNF-alpha augmented CD38 expression and ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity, which were attenuated by dexamethasone. TNF-alpha increased NF-kappaB expression and its activation, and dexamethasone partially reversed these effects. TNF-alpha increased the expression of IkappaBalpha, and dexamethasone increased it further. An inhibitor of NF-kappaB activation or transfection of cells with IkappaB mutants decreased TNF-alpha-induced CD38 expression. The results indicate that TNF-alpha-induced CD38 expression involves NF-kappaB expression and its activation and dexamethasone inhibits CD38 expression through NF-kappaB-dependent and -independent mechanisms."

In striatal neurons, RGS9-2 is tightly associated with a novel palmitoylated protein, R7BP (R7 family binding protein). Here we report that R7BP acts to target the localization of RGS9-2 to the plasma membrane. Examination of the subcellular distribution in native striatal neurons revealed that both R7BP and RGS9-2 are almost entirely associated with the neuronal membranes. In addition to the plasma membrane, a large portion of RGS9-2 was found in the neuronal specializations, the postsynaptic densities, where it forms complexes with R7BP and its constitutive partner Gβ5. Using site-directed mutagenesis we found that the molecular determinants that specify the subcellular targeting of RGS9-2·Gβ5·R7BP complex are contained within the 21 C-terminal amino acids of R7BP. This function of the C terminus was found to require the synergistic contributions of its two distinct elements, a polybasic motif and palmitoylated cysteines, which when combined are sufficient for directing the intracellular localization of the constituent protein. In differentiated neurons, the C-terminal targeting motif of R7BP was found to be essential for mediating its postsynaptic localization. In addition to the plasma membrane targeting elements, we identified two functional nuclear localization sequences that can mediate the import of R7BP into the nucleus upon depalmitoylation.

Hooks S.B. Mol. Interv. 2004; 4: 200-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 7Burchett S.A. Neuromolecular Med. 2005; 7: 101-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The R7 subfamily contains four highly homologous proteins, RGS6, RGS7, RGS9, and RGS11, which are expressed exclusively in the nervous system (8Gold S.J. Ni Y.G. Dohlman H.G. Nestler E.J. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8024-8037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as constitutive complexes with a type 5 G protein β subunit (Gβ5) (9Snow B.E. Betts L. Mangion J. Sondek J. Siderovski D.P. Proc. Natl.

A. 1999; 96: 1947-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). RGS9, with its two splice isoforms, is one of the best-studied members of the R7 subfamily. The short isoform RGS9-1 is expressed in the photoreceptor neurons where it regulates the visual signal transduction cascade (12Arshavsky V.Y. Lamb T.D. Pugh Jr., E.N. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 153-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 13Cowan C.W. He W. Wensel T.G. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2000; 65: 341-359Crossref Google Scholar). The long splice isoform RGS9-2 is predominantly expressed in the striatum and the central nervous system structures, mediating nociceptive responses where it was shown to regulate dopamine and μ-opioid pathways (14Cabrera-Vera T.M.

In photoreceptors, the function of RGS9-1 is controlled by its interaction with the transmembrane protein R9AP (RGS9 anchor protein) (18Hu G. Wensel T.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We and others have found that, in the brain, RGS9-2 as well as other R7 RGS proteins also exist in complexes with the novel membrane protein R7BP (R7 binding protein), a close homolog of R9AP (22Martemyanov K.A.

Huettner J.E. Linder M.E. Blumer K.J. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 623-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Membrane localization of R7BP has been shown to be mediated by its palmitoylation, without which it accumulates in the nucleus (23Drenan R.M. Doupnik C.A. Boyle M.P. Muglia L.J. Huettner J.E. Linder M.E. Blumer K.J. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 623-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Examination of the role of R7BP in R7 RGS protein function revealed that it can potently stimulate RGS-mediated inactivation of the GIRK (G protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium) channel responses elicited by the activation of m2 muscarinic receptors in live cells (23Drenan R.M.

In this study, we analyzed the mechanisms that regulate the intracellular targeting of R7BP and its partner, RGS9-2, in neurons. Using primary neuronal cultures and established neuronal cell lines, we have found that the major targeting determinants that control the intracellular destination of RGS9-2·R7BP complexes are contained within the short C-terminal domain of R7BP. We identified that the C terminus of R7BP carries two distinct types of signals, a functional nuclear localization sequence and a plasma membrane retention sequence. We have further demonstrated that, in striatal neurons, the presence of the C-terminal domain is required for the targeting of RGS9-2·R7BP complex to the functional specializations of the neuronal plasma membranes, the postsynaptic densities. Antibodies and Reagents—Generation of sheep anti-R7BP (N-terminal epitope) and anti-RGS9-2CT (C-terminal epitope) has been described previously (22Martemyanov K.A. Yoo P.J. Skiba N.P. Arshavsky V.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5133-5136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Affinity-purified antibodies were stored in PBS buffer containing 50% glycerol at a concentration of 3 mg/ml (RGS9-2CT) and 12 mg/ml (R7BP) and used at a 1:10,000 dilution in Western blot analysis. Goat antibodies against PSD-95 and rabbit antibodies against lamin A were purchased from ABcam and used at 1:1,000 dilutions. Sheep antibodies against the C terminus of Gβ5 were a gift from Dr. Vadim Arshavsky (Duke University). pcDNA3.1 TOPO cloning systems were obtained from Invitrogen. All general chemicals were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Cell Culture, Immunostaining, and Microscopy—NG108-15 cells were provided by Dr. Ping-Yee Law (University of Minnesota). Cells were grown on poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips (BD Biosciences) in standard Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mm sodium hypoxanthine, 0.4 μm aminopterin, 16 μm thymidine, 100 units of penicillin, and 100 μgof streptomycin. When cells reached ∼70% confluency, they were transfected with DNA constructs using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The ratio of Lipofectamine to DNA used was 4 μl:2 μg/4 cm2 cell surface. Cells were grown for 24–36 h post-transfection when transfected with a single DNA construct or for 48–56 h post-transfection when multiple constructs were used. For immunocytochemical analysis, NG108-15 cells were fixed at room temperature for 10 min using 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and then washed four times for 5 min with PTS buffer (PBS supplemented with 20 mm Tris HCl (pH 7.8), 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.25 mm CaCl2, and 0.1% saponin). Blocking was performed with PTS supplemented with 2% goat serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Following 1 h of incubation with anti-R7BP antibody at a 1:1,000 dilution, the cells were washed five times with PTS solution for 15 min each wash and then incubated with goat anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor 546 (Invitrogen) at a 1:2,000 dilution in blocking solution for an hour. Coverslips were washed five times with PTS buffer and mounted using Fluoromount medium (Biomeda). Cultures of hippocampal neurons were obtained from neonatal rats and maintained as described previously with minor modifications (24Randall R.D. Thayer S.A. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 1882-1895Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, on embryonic day 17, fetal rat hippocampi were dissected and into Ca2+/Mg2+-free HEPES-buffered Hanks' salt solution (CMF-HH). HH is composed of the following (in mm): 20 HEPES, 137 NaCl, 1.3 CaCl2, 0.4 MgSO4, 0.5 MgCl2, and 5.0 KCl. Hippocampal cells were disassociated by trituration with four flame-restricted 5-ml glass pipettes and spun down for 10 min at 1000 × g. The supernatant was removed and cells were then resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin. The cells were triturated for a second time using the same four flame-restricted glass pipettes. The cells were counted and plated at a density of 16,250 cells/well on 25-mm round coverglasses that were coated with poly-d-lysine (0.1 mg/ml). The cells were grown in a humidified atmosphere of 10% CO2 and 90% air (pH 7.4) at 37 °C and fed 1 and 6 days after dissection with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% horse serum and penicillin/streptomycin. At 10 days following the dissection, neurons were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000. For the detection of GFP, cells grown on coverslips were rinsed with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min, washed four times with PBS, incubated with solution of DAPI (Invitrogen), rinsed with PBS, and embedded in Fluoromount (Biomeda) on glass slides. Images of the cells were captured using a Bio-Rad 1024 multiphoton confocal microscope via LaserSharp version 3.1 software (Bio-Rad). The confocal is equipped with a Tsunami tunable femtosecond laser system (SpectraPhysics, Mountain View, CA) and a krypton-argon laser. GFP was observed by exciting the cells at 488 nm with the krypton-argon laser and monitoring the emission at 522 nm with a DF35 band-pass barrier filter. DAPI fluorescence was observed with excitation from the Tsunami at 735 nm with a 460 long-pass barrier filter. Each image consisted of a single optical section through a central plane of the cells that was then frame-averaged to reduce random noise fluctuations. Images were processed and analyzed using Confocal Assistant version 4.02 software. 3T. Brelje, personal communication. DNA Constructs and Site-directed Mutagenesis—The coding region for Gβ5S was amplified by PCR using the 5′ primer GAAGATGGCAACCGATGGGC and the 3′ primer TTATGCCCAAACTCTTAGGGTGTGATC, from the Marathon-ready mouse brain cDNA library (Invitrogen) and cloned into the pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO vector. RGS9-2 was cloned into the same vector after PCR amplification of the coding region using a cDNA clone provided by Dr. S. Gold (University of Texas Southwestern). The cloning of R7BP cDNA has been previously described (22Martemyanov K.A. Yoo P.J. Skiba N.P. Arshavsky V.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5133-5136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Full-length R7BP cDNA was subcloned into the mammalian expression pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO vector. For the expression of R7BP fused to GFP, the R7BP coding region was placed at the 3′ end of the GFP open reading frame in the vector. The resulting construct encoded the GFP-R7BP fusion protein under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. C-terminal mutants of R7BP were generated by PCR amplification using the 5′ flanking primer (5′-GATATGAGTTCTGCACCGAATGGGC-3′ and the following mutagenic primers at the 3′ end: R7BPΔCT (amino acids 1–236), 5′-CTACGTTAGATTCAGAAGGCTGC-3′; R7BP-RE (R243E,R246E), 5′-CTAGCTTGAGACAAGACAACATAAGCCGAAGAACCTTTCCTTCCGTTCTCTGACCATGG-3′; and R7BP-CA (C252A,C253A), 5′-CTAGCTTGAGACAAGAGCAGCTAAGCCGAAGAA-3′. The R7BPΔPB mutant (lacking amino acids 242–247) was generated by ligating a linker coding for the C-terminal part of R7BP (amino acids 248–257) into the NcoI-treated pcDNA3.1/NT-GFP-TOPO containing wild-type R7BP gene. For the generation of the GFP-CT construct (amino acids 242–257), a synthetic oligonucleotide duplex coding for the C-terminal 16 amino acids of R7BP was cloned at the 3′ end of the GFP sequence in the same open reading frame. The same approach was used for the generation of the GFP-CTRE construct (amino acids 242–257 with R243E,R246E mutations). Quadruple mutants R7BP-RECA (C252A,C253A,R243E,R246E) and R7BP-CAΔNLS-2 (C252A,C253A-(Δ242–247)) were generated by amplifying the coding regions of R7BP-RE or R7BPΔPB, respectively, with the mutagenic primer used for the generation of R7BP-CA. R7BP-CAΔNLS-1 (C252A,C253A-(Δ1–11)) was generated by amplifying the cDNA of R7BP-CA mutant with the 5′ mutagenic primer AGCCGGTCCACCCGCTCC and the 3′ flanking primer. The same strategy was used to generate the R7BP-CAΔNLS-1+ΔNLS-2 mutant (Δ1–11,Δ237–257). All cDNAs coding for R7BP mutants were cloned into the pcDNA3.1/NT-GFP-TOPO vector to produce GFP fusions. Constructs were propagated into Escherichia coli Top-10 strain (Invitrogen) isolated using Maxiprep kits (Qiagen) and sequenced. Fractionation of Brain Extracts—C57/B6 mice (Charles River) were sacrificed by brief CO2 inhalation followed by cervical dislocation. Brains were dissected into ice-cold HEPES-sucrose buffer (4 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.32 m sucrose) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktails (Sigma). All procedures were performed at 4 °C. For the biopsies of striatal tissues, whole mouse brains were cut into 3-mm-thick coronal sections. The caudate/putamen regions were punched out from the sections using a 2-mm trephine. Tissues (∼80 mg) were homogenized in 500 μl of HEPES-sucrose by repeated passes through a series of 18–26-gauge needles. Subcellular fractionation of brain extracts were performed using a variation of the method described by Blackstone et al. (25Blackstone C.D. Moss S.J. Martin L.J. Levey A.I. Price D.L. Huganir R.L. J. Neurochem. 1992; 58: 1118-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) and Lau et al. (26Lau L.F. Mammen A. Ehlers M.D. Kindler S. Chung W.J. Garner C.C. Huganir R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21622-21628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Homogenates were briefly subjected to sedimentation at 1,000 × g for 10 min. The pellet containing the nuclei (P1) was resuspended in 500 μl of HEPES-sucrose and resedimented. The resulting pellet was designated as the nuclear fraction (N). postnuclear supernatants (S) were combined and sedimented at 10,000 × g for 15 min. The pellet was resuspended in 500 μl of HEPES-sucrose and resedimented yielding a crude synaptosomal fraction. The supernatant was removed and subjected to a 45-min centrifugation at 100,000 × g to prepare the membrane (M; plasma membrane and microsomes) and cytosolic (C) fractions. Synaptosomes were lysed by resuspending in 450 μl of ice-cold H2O followed by prompt adjustment to 4 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. The lysate was centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 20 min to yield a crude synaptic vesicle fraction (supernatant) and a lysed synaptosomal membrane fraction (pellet). For the isolation of pure synaptic plasma membrane, synaptosomal membranes were resuspended in 200 μl of HEPES-sucrose and layered on top of a 0.8, 1, and 1.2 m sucrose gradient. Samples were centrifuged at 150,000 × g in a swinging bucket rotor for 2 h. Synaptic plasma membranes were recovered from the interface between 1.0 and 1.2 m sucrose, diluted to 0.32 m sucrose, and sedimented at 150,000 × g for 30 min. The resulting pellet was designated as the purified synaptic plasma membrane fraction. Post-synaptic densities were isolated as described previously (27Carlin R.K. Grab D.J. Cohen R.S. Siekevitz P. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 86: 831-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar, 28Cho K.O. Hunt C.A. Kennedy M.B. Neuron. 1992; 9: 929-942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). The synaptosomal membrane pellet was resuspended in 500 μl of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and incubated with end-over-end mixing for 15 min at +4 °C. The Triton X-100-resistant fraction (T1P) was recovered by centrifuging the sample at 32,000 × g for 20 min. The resulting pellet was resuspended in the same buffer, incubated for an additional 15 min, and sedimented at 100,000 × g for 20 min to pellet the postsynaptic densities (T2P). Protein content in the fractions was quantified by Bradford assay. Samples containing 15 μg of total protein were loaded onto a polyacrylamide gel and subjected to Western blot analysis. Immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitation was conducted as described earlier (22Martemyanov K.A. Yoo P.J. Skiba N.P. Arshavsky V.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5133-5136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The postsynaptic density fraction T1P prepared from the striatum of one mouse was extracted with PBS buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) for 1 h on ice. The extract was centrifuged and the resulting supernatant applied to 10 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) covalently attached to 100 μg of sheep affinity-purified anti-RGS9-2 CT using BS3 cross-linker (Pierce). In the control immunoprecipitation, equal amounts of non-immune sheep IgGs (Sigma) were used. After 1 h of incubation, the beads were washed three times with 1% Triton X-100-PBS buffer. Bound proteins were eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by Western blotting. Metabolic Labeling—NG108-15 cells were grown in T-75 flasks until confluency, at which point they were transfected with the DNA constructs containing R7BP genes using Lipofectamine 2000. 48 h after transfection, the medium was aspirated and replaced with 5 ml of fresh labeling medium composed of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 330 μCi/ml [3H]palmitic acid (40 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cells in the labeling medium were incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 3 h. Following incubation, the cells were washed twice with PBS (Invitrogen) and scraped into 15 ml of ice-cold PBS supplemented with 1% Triton X-100 and 0.01% SDS. The cells were lysed by passage through 23-gauge needles, and insoluble material was removed by 30 min of centrifugation at 10,000 × g. The resulting extract was applied to 10 μl of protein G-agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences) coupled to 60 μg of anti-R7BP antibodies. Immunoprecipitated R7BP proteins were eluted from the beads with SDS sample buffer, separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Membranes were soaked in Amplify (Amersham Biosciences), dried, and exposed to x-ray film (BioMax MR, Kodak) for 1 week. Following fluorographic analysis, polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were rewetted in methanol and used in Western blot analysis with anti-R7BP antibodies. R7BP Targets RGS9-2 Localization to the Plasma Membrane—We have recently identified R7BP as the protein that interacts nearly stoichiometrically with RGS9-2 in the membrane fractions of the striatum (22Martemyanov K.A. Yoo P.J. Skiba N.P. Arshavsky V.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5133-5136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In this study, we started addressing the functional role(s) of this interaction by analyzing the intracellular localization of RGS9-2 and R7BP upon their co-expression in cell cultures. Because RGS9-2 has been shown to exist as an obligatory complex with the Gβ5 subunit in the brain (10Chen C.K. Eversole-Cire P. Zhang H.K. Mancino V. Chen Y.J. He W. Wensel T.G. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6604-6609Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 22Martemyanov K.A. Yoo P.J. Skiba N.P. Arshavsky V.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5133-5136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), we co-expressed RGS9-2 with the brain-specific splice isoform of Gβ5, Gβ5S. The expression of RGS9-2, Gβ5, and R7BP in vivo is restricted to neuronal tissues, which suggests that much of their native properties may be dependent upon the specific intracellular environment of neurons. Therefore, we chose to use the NG108-15 mouse neuroblastoma/rat glioma hybrid cells, which share many common properties with native differentiated neurons (29McGee Jr., R. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1980; 33: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 1, RGS9-2·Gβ5 and R7BP show distinctly different localization patterns when expressed in these cells separately. Although RGS9-2·Gβ5 is localized exclusively in the cytoplasm, R7BP is restricted to the plasma membrane. However, co-expression of GFP-labeled RGS9-2·Gβ5 with R7BP resulted in the co-localization of both proteins to the plasma membrane. This result demonstrates that R7BP acts to target the membrane localization of the otherwise soluble RGS9-2·Gβ5. This is consistent with the observation that palmitoylated R7BP is capable of interaction with all four members of the R7 RGS protein family in the plasma membrane (23Drenan R.M. Doupnik C.A. Boyle M.P. Muglia L.J. Huettner J.E. Linder M.E. Blumer K.J. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 623-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Plasma Membrane Localization of R7BP Is Mediated by Its C Terminus—The R7BP molecule can be roughly divided into two parts, a four-helical N-terminal domain that shares significant homology with a related protein, R9AP, and a unique C terminus occupying the position corresponding to the transmembrane helix in R9AP (22Martemyanov K.A. Yoo P.J. Skiba N.P. Arshavsky V.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5133-5136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 23Drenan R.M. Doupnik C.A. Boyle M.P. Muglia L.J. Huettner J.E. Linder M.E. Blumer K.J. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 623-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). This 20-amino-acid C-terminal domain of R7BP is structurally similar to the C-terminal sequences of K-Ras proteins and contains two main features, a polybasic stretch of six consecutive arginines/lysines and a conserved cysteine doublet that undergoes post-translational palmitoylation (Fig. 2A) (22Martemyanov K.A. Yoo P.J. Skiba N.P. Arshavsky V.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5133-5136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 23Drenan R.M. Doupnik C.A. Boyle M.P. Muglia L.J. Huettner J.E. Linder M.E. Blumer K.J. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 623-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Fig. 2B indicates that the C-terminal domain plays a crucial role in determining subcellular localization of R7BP. Deletion of this domain resulted in complete abolishment of the membrane attachment of the truncated mutant, which was instead found distributed throughout the cytoplasm and the nucleus of the cells. To test whether the C-terminal domain of R7BP is sufficient in providing plasma membrane localization, we expressed a construct containing the C-terminal domain of R7BP fused to the C terminus of GFP. Unlike soluble GFP, which is evenly distributed throughout the cytoplasm, GFP-CT was localized exclusively to the plasma membrane, mimicking the localization pattern of wild-type R7BP. These data indicate that the plasma membrane-targeting signal is located within the C-terminal domain of R7BP and that this signal is sufficient to determine its subcellular localization. Plasma Membrane Targeting of R7BP Requires Synergistic Contributions of a Polybasic Region and Palmitoylated Cysteines—The sufficiency of the C-terminal domain in directing R7PB plasma membrane localization prompted us to determine the relative contributions of the two structural elements located within this domain, the polybasic region and the palmitoylated cysteines. Polybasic clusters adjacent to sites of lipid modifications have been shown to mediate membrane localization in several members of the Ras superfamily (30Williams C.L. Cell Signal. 2003; 15: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), suggesting a similar functional significance in R7BP. To test this possibility, we used site-directed mutagenesis to construct R7BP mutants with disrupted polybasic motifs (Fig. 3A). This was achieved by either delet"
https://openalex.org/W2123292213,"β-Catenin is a key molecule involved in both cell adhesion and Wnt signaling pathway. However, the exact relationship between these two roles has not been clearly elucidated. Tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin was shown to decrease its binding to E-cadherin, leading to decreased cell adhesion and increased β-catenin signaling. We have previously shown that receptor-like protein-tyrosine phosphatase PCP-2 localizes to the adherens junctions and directly binds and dephosphorylates β-catenin, suggesting that PCP-2 might regulate the balance between signaling and adhesive β-catenin. Here we demonstrate that PCP-2 can inhibit both the wild-type and constitutively active forms of β-catenin in activating target genes such as c-myc. The phosphatase activity of PCP-2 is required for this effect since loss of catalytic activity attenuates its inhibitory effect on β-catenin activation. Expression of PCP-2 in SW480 colon cancer cells can lead to stabilization of cytosolic pools of β-catenin perhaps, by virtue of their physical interaction. PCP-2 expression also leads to increased membrane-bound E-cadherin and greater stabilization of adherens junctions by dephosphorylation of β-catenin, which could further sequester cytosolic β-catenin and thus inhibit β-catenin mediated nuclear signaling. Furthermore, SW480 cells stably expressing PCP-2 have a reduced ability to proliferate and migrate. Thus, PCP-2 may play an important role in the maintenance of epithelial integrity, and a loss of its regulatory function may be an alternative mechanism for activating β-catenin signaling. β-Catenin is a key molecule involved in both cell adhesion and Wnt signaling pathway.

Reversible and dynamic tyrosine phosphorylation is controlled by the opposing actions of protein-tyrosine kinases and protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) 2The abbreviations used are: PTP, protein-tyrosine phosphatases; RPTP, receptor-like PTP; MAM-PTP, MAM-subfamily PTP; APC, adenomatous polyposis coli; EGF, epidermal growth factor; EGFR, EGF receptor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; siRNA, small interfering RNA; Tcf, TCF, T cell factor; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; WT, wild type; mu, mutant. (1Majeti R. Weiss A. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2441-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). PTPs are a large family that is broadly classified into receptor-like protein-tyrosine phosphatases (RPTPs) and cytosolic PTPs (2Andersen J.N. Mortensen O.H. Peters G.H. Drake P.G. Iversen L.F. Olsen O.H. Jansen P.G. Andersen H.S. Tonks N.K. Moller N.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7117-7136Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). A subfamily of RPTPs containing an MAM (Meprin/A5/PTP mu) domain in the ectodomain followed by an Ig-like domain and fibronectin type III repeats is defined as the MAM-subfamily PTPs (MAM-PTPs), which include PCP-2, PTPμ, PTPκ, and PTPρ (3Wang H. Lian Z. Lerch M.M. Chen Z. Xie W. Ullrich A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2555-2562PubMed Google Scholar, 4Besco J. Popesco M.C. Davuluri R.V. Frostholm A. Rotter A. BMC Genomics. 2004; 5: 14Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). These RPTPs also contain a single membrane-spanning region with two cytoplasmic PTP domains. The intracellular juxtamembrane domain of these RPTPs contains a region that is homologous to the conserved intracellular domain of the cadherins (5Zondag G.C. Moolenaar W.H. Biochimie (Paris). 1997; 79: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Cadherins are a family of calcium-dependent adhesion molecules that play an essential role in the formation of the cell-cell contacts termed adherens junctions. Cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion is important for development and maintenance of epithelial tissue integrity, and its disturbance contributes to the invasive and metastatic phenotype of epithelial tumors. Through their intracellular domains, cadherins associate with molecules of the Armadillo superfamily including β-catenin, which links them to the actin cytoskeleton via the α-catenin bridge (6Hirohashi S.

Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 685-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). In addition to its adhesive functions, β-catenin has also been found to serve as a key component in Wnt signaling (8Peifer M. Science. 1997; 275: 1752-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 9Moon R.T. Bowerman B. Boutros M. Perrimon N. Science. 2002; 296: 1644-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). When released from E-cadherin, uncomplexed β-catenin is rapidly degraded by cytosolic proteasomes. Failure to properly degrade β-catenin, primarily attributable to an impairment in its ubiquitination, results in its posttranslational stabilization and passage into the nucleus, where it interacts with transcription factors of T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (Tcf/Lef) family to activate target genes involved in cell growth control and apoptosis such as c-myc and cyclin D1 (10He T.C.

Nature. 1999; 398: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (3265) Google Scholar). Aberrant activation of β-catenin signaling has been implicated in cancer formation in numerous basic and clinical studies (12Giles R.H. van Es J.H. Clevers H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1653: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (1348) Google Scholar). There is increasing evidence to suggest that phosphorylation of tyrosyl residues in some components of the cadherin/catenin complex leads to loss of adhesive function and breakdown of adherens junction. Roura et al. (13Roura S. Miravet S. Piedra J. Garcia d.H. Dunach M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36734-36740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar) reported that phosphorylation of tyrosine residue 654 on β-catenin diminishes its association with E-cadherin. Furthermore, they observed that phosphorylation of Tyr-654 also stimulated the association of β-catenin to the basal transcription factor TATA-binding protein. Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that phosphorylation-dependent release of β-catenin from the cadherin complex not only regulates the integrity and function of the adhesion complex but may also be an alternative mechanism for activating β-catenin signaling (14Nelson W.J. Nusse R. Science. 2004; 303: 1483-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (2253) Google Scholar). We and others have previously shown that several RPTPs were functionally associated with E-cadherin/β-catenin complex and play a regulatory role in the control of the integrity of cell junctions, presumably by keeping them in a dephosphorylated state (15Brady-Kalnay S.M. Mourton T. Nixon J.P. Pietz G.E. Kinch M. Chen H. Brackenbury R. Rimm D.L. Del Vecchio R.L. Tonks N.K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 16Brady-Kalnay S.M.

We demonstrate that PCP-2 repressed not only wild-type but also active mutant β-catenin-induced transcriptional activity. PCP-2 expression in human colon carcinoma cell line SW480, in which the β-catenin signaling pathway is up-regulated, led to stabilization of cytosolic pools of β-catenin, perhaps by their physical interaction and by enhancing adherens junction stability, thus decreasing the transcriptional activity of β-catenin by sequestering the protein at the plasma membrane. This effect was attributed to the inhibition of cell proliferation and migration when PCP-2 was transfected into SW480 cells. These results delineate a novel role for PCP-2 in regulation of the canonical β-catenin signaling pathway. Cell Culture and Transfections—HEK293, SW480 colon carcinoma cells, A431 human epidermoid carcinoma cells, and SW850 pancreatic carcinoma cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Stable SW480 clones were generated by transfection using JetPEI (Polyplus) of pcDNA3.0 or PCP-2 constructs and screened by Western blotting. Positive clones expressing similar levels of PCP-2 were cultured in the presence of 300 μg/ml G418 for maintenance of transgene expression. Plasmids—Different recombinants for wild-type or mutant forms of PCP-2 were constructed using pcDNA3/Myc(–) (Invitrogen). All β-catenin constructs tagged with Myc were produced by PCR amplification with the use of human wild-type β-catenin in a pRK5RS vector as a template. The fidelity of the constructs was verified by DNA sequencing. The resulting PCR products were subcloned into the pcDNA3/Myc(–) vector. N-terminal-deleted β-catenin (β-ΔN) lacks the first 140 amino acids, C-terminal-deleted β-catenin (β-ΔC) lacks the last 147 amino acids, and armadillo-domain-deleted β-catenin (β-ΔArm) contains both the N-terminal 140 amino acids and the C-terminal 147 amino acids but lacks the 141–633 amino acids. Point mutant Y654E was obtained using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Antibodies—Monoclonal antibodies specific for E-cadherin and β-catenin were purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories and Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), respectively. Polyclonal antibodies reactive with PCP-2 were used as described (18Yan H.X. He Y.Q. Dong H. Zhang P. Zeng J.Z. Cao H.F. Wu M.C. Wang H.Y. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15854-15860Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The monoclonal antibodies against Myc tag (9B11) and phosphotyrosine (P-Tyr-102) were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. The monoclonal antibodies specific for c-Myc was purchased from Neomarker (Fremint, CA). β-Catenin/Tcf Luciferase Reporter Assay—Two different Tcf-luciferase reporter constructs were used in this study: an intact wild-type Tcf-luciferase construct (pGL-OT) and a mutant Tcf-luciferase reporter construct (pGL-OF) (both gifts of B. Vogelstein) (10He T.C. Sparks A.B. Rago C. Hermeking H. Zawel L. da Costa L.T. Morin P.J. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1998; 281: 1509-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (4092) Google Scholar). The cyclin D1 reporter plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. O. Tetsu (11Tetsu O. McCormick F. Nature. 1999; 398: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (3265) Google Scholar). A Dual Luciferase reporter assay was carried out according to the manufacturer's suggestions (Promega). pRL-TK (Promega) was cotransfected with each reporter construct to normalize for transfection. All experiments were performed in triplicate. Immunofluorescence—Cells were cultured on glass coverslips, fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100. The coverslips were incubated with E-cadherin or β-catenin monoclonal antibodies at 4 °C overnight. The secondary antibody was fluorescein isothiocyanate- or Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (Sigma). After being washed in Tris-buffered saline, coverslips were mounted with 90% glycerol in Tris-buffered saline and analyzed with a conventional fluorescence microscope (Olympus IX70). Immunoprecipitation, Immunoblotting, and Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—Cell extracts were prepared using Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin). The supernatant was collected and incubated with antibodies at 4 °C for 3 h and then with protein A for an additional 3 h. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer and resuspended in SDS sample buffer. For immunoblot analysis, samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schüll). The membrane was first probed with a specific antibody and then detected using the ECL system with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences). For ChIP assay, chromatin was isolated from formaldehyde-treated SW480 cells, fragmented to a mean size <600 bp, and subjected to ChIP using chromatin immunoprecipitation assay kits (Upstate Biotechnology, Hamburg, Germany) together with 10 μgof β-catenin-specific antibody following Upstate Biotechnology's protocol. A specific primer pair for the c-myc promoter region was used for investigating the binding of β-catenin to DNA. For analyzing chromatin input, one-fiftieth of the precipitated chromatin was taken as a template, and for all other reactions, one-tenth of the precipitated chromatin was taken as a template. Cell Fractionation—To obtain Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble fractions, cells were incubated with Triton buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.3 m sucrose, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 15 min on a rocking platform. After centrifugation, the supernatant (Triton X-100-soluble fraction) was collected. The cell pellet was resuspended in SDS lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2.5 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) and subjected to standard SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. Aggregation Assay and Wound Healing—Cell-cell adhesion was evaluated in an aggregation assay, as described previously (19Nam J.S. Ino Y. Sakamoto M. Hirohashi S. Clin. Cancer Res. 2002; 8: 2430-2436PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, cultures were rinsed with 10 mm HCMF buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 0.3 mm Na2HPO4·7H2O, 5.5 mm glucose) containing 2 mm CaCl2 and trypsinized into single cells by incubation with 0.04% trypsin in HCMF buffer supplemented with 2 mm CaCl2. They were then incubated under gyratory shaking at 80 rpm for 30 min in HCMF containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 1.25 mm Ca2+ and photographed. For in vitro wound assays, monolayers of cells were wounded by scraping with a plastic pipette tip, rinsed several times with medium to remove dislodged cells, and cultured in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 24 h in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2. Cells that had migrated into the wound area were photographed with a light microscope equipped with phase-contrast optics (Olympus IX70). Cell Surface Biotinylation—Cells were rinsed once in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and twice in ice-cold PBS, pH 7.5, and then incubated with 1.0 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (biotin disulfide N-hydroxysuccinimide ester, Pierce) and dissolved in PBS for 30 min on a rocking platform on ice. Biotinylation was stopped by washing twice in PBS containing 100 mm glycine and twice in PBS for altogether 35 min. Cells were solubilized in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors: 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin), pH 7.4. The unlysed cells were removed by centrifugation at 15,700 × g at 4 °C. A 50-μl volume of streptavidin-agarose beads was then added to the supernatant to isolate cell-membrane protein. Membrane-associated E-cadherin or β-catenin was detected in the pool of surface proteins by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Generation of Recombinant Adenovirus Expressing PCP-2—The PCP-2 coding sequence insert was cloned into the adenoviral shuttle vector (Stratagene). Then it was linearized with PmeI and cotransformed with E1-deleted adenoviral backbone AdEasy-1 into the competent bacterial strain BJ5183, which allows efficient recombination to occur. After screening, recombinants for adenoviruses Ad-PCP-2 and Ad-Blank, which contain no insert sequence as a control, were generated. Growth Curves and Colony Formation Assay—Growth Curves, stable SW480 cell lines (5 × 104) were plated per well of 6-well plates. At each time point, the cells were trypsinized and counted. Each data point was performed in triplicate. The measurement of viable cell mass was also performed with a Cell Counting Kit-8 (Dojin Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan) to count living cells by WST-8. For colony formation after transfection with drug selection, an equivalent number of SW480 cells (106) were transfected with 2 μg of vector or PCP-2 constructs conferring neomycin drug resistance. After transfection, cells were replated and selected in G418-containing medium for 3 weeks, and the resultant colonies were fixed and stained with crystal violet. Transfections were done in triplicate for each combination of plasmids. RNA Interference—Three double-stranded siRNA oligonucleotides against PCP-2 (sense strand, 5′-CCACAAAGAAGAAAGACAAGGUCAA-3′, 5′-GGGACAUCAAGAUUAUGCUGGUGAA-3′, 5′-GAUCCGCAUUGAUCCUCAGAGUAAU-3′) were provided by Invitrogen. Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) was used as the transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's directions with 150 nmol of siRNA per well in a six-well dish. A scrambled siRNA was used as the control. siRNA transfected cells were incubated for 36–48 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. In Vivo Tumorigenicity Assay—SW480 transfectants were released from tissue culture dishes and washed in serum-free medium. Tumor cells were diluted with PBS and injected into the mid-dorsum of BALB/c nude mice (4–6 weeks old) in a total of volume 0.1 ml (5 × 106). Animals were inspected weekly for tumor development. Growing tumors were measured using vernier calipers, and tumor volume was calculated by the formula length × width2 × 0.52, which approximates the volume of an elliptical solid. Statistical analysis was performed by Student's t test (two-tailed). The criterion for statistical significance was taken as p < 0.05. All procedures regarding animals were conducted according to institutionally approved protocols. PCP-2 Inhibited β-Catenin-mediated Transcriptional Activity—We have previously demonstrated functional interaction between β-catenin and PCP-2. To study its effect on β-catenin-mediated transactivation, PCP-2 was cotransfected with wild-type β-catenin into HEK293 cells together with Tcf reporter plasmid pGL-OT. As shown in Fig. 1A, PCP-2 very strongly suppressed β-catenin-mediated luciferase activity driven from the pGL-OT reporter in a dose-dependent manner. We also used LiCl, an inhibitor of GSK3β activity and widely used to mimic Wnt signaling, to increase endogenous β-catenin levels and detect its transactivation potential after transfection with PCP-2. Treatment of the cells with LiCl resulted in an evident increase in β-catenin levels. Although β-catenin activity was elevated in empty vector-transfected cells, this effect was significantly reduced in cells transfected with PCP-2 (Fig. 1B). As functional β-catenin/Tcf-binding sites have been identified in the promoter of cyclin D1, we then tested the effect of PCP-2 on the cyclin D1 reporter transcription. Fig. 1C shows that cyclin D1 reporter was strongly transcribed in response to wild-type β-catenin. However, exogenous expression of PCP-2 imposed a substantial inhibition of the cyclin D1 promoter activity. To address the inhibitory effect of PCP-2 on β-catenin transcriptional activity under normal signaling conditions, we knocked down endogenous PCP-2 level using RNA interference strategy and then examined changes of β-catenin reporter gene activity after EGF stimulation in A431 human epidermoid carcinoma cells, which overexpress EGFR. As shown in Fig. 1, D and E, PCP-2 down-regulation by siRNA led to an increased transcriptional activity of β-catenin upon EGF treatment as compared with cells transfected with control siRNA. The specificity of PCP-2-mediated effects on Tcf reporters was confirmed by using pGL-OF, which harbors mutated Tcf-binding sites and was not influenced by PCP-2. Taken together, these results suggest that PCP-2 can exert specifically inhibitory effect on β-catenin-dependent transcriptional activity. PCP-2 Down-regulated the Active Mutant Form of β-Catenin-induced Signaling—Mutations in the ubiquitin-targeting sequence of β-catenin occur in a number of different cancers (20Polakis P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). Among these mutations, S37A and N-terminal truncation are common stabilizing ones that render β-catenin resistant to ubiquitination-dependent degradation. To test whether PCP-2 could modulate the transcriptional activities of the degradation-resistant mutants of β-catenin, we cotransfected Myc-tagged wild-type and S37A, ΔN, ΔC, or ΔArm mutant β-catenin constructs (Fig. 2A) together with empty vector or PCP-2 and the Tcf reporter plasmids pGL-OT into HEK293 cells and monitored β-catenin signaling by assaying the reporter activity. As shown in Fig. 2B, transfection of S37A and ΔN mutant forms of β-catenin significantly increased the Tcf reporter activity in HEK293 cells, whereas ΔC and ΔArm did not, probably due to the loss of Tcf-binding sites and transactivation domain of β-catenin. Cotransfection of PCP-2 significantly reduced both S37A and ΔN mutant forms of β-catenin-induced Tcf reporter activation, indicating that the inhibitory effect of PCP-2 on β-catenin is independent of its degradation sensitivity. The Phosphatase Activity Was Involved in PCP-2-mediated Repression of β-Catenin Signaling—We previously showed that PCP-2 bound β-catenin and conferred its dephosphorylation (18Yan H.X. He Y.Q. Dong H. Zhang P. Zeng J.Z. Cao H.F. Wu M.C. Wang H.Y. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15854-15860Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To examine whether the tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin was attributed to its transcriptional activity, we transiently transfected wild-type β-catenin or its point mutants Y654E and Y654F, which mimic the phosphorylated or dephosphorylated states of Tyr-654 respectively, together with pGL-OT reporter plasmids and determined β-catenin-sensitive reporter activity 24 h after transfection. As shown in Fig. 3A, expression of Y654E β-catenin mutant raised the activity of this reporter gene to a higher extent than the WT and Y654F forms of β-catenin did. Interestingly, as compared with the wild-type β-catenin, PCP-2-mediated fold repression of β-catenin-dependent transcriptional activity was evidently decreased in the presence of the Y654E mutant, which was resistant to dephosphorylation by PCP-2 (Fig. 3B). These data suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin lead to a greater stimulation of β-catenin-Tcf-mediated transcription, and PCP-2-mediated dephosphorylation was necessary for its role in negatively regulating β-catenin signaling. To further confirm these results, a catalytically inactive mutant of PCP-2 (PCP-2/CS) was generated in which critical cysteine residues in both PTP domains were mutated to serine. As shown in Fig. 3C, introduction of the Cys to Ser mutation in both PTP domains evidently interfered with its inhibitory effect on β-catenin activity. To examine whether such mutations affect PCP-2 association with β-catenin, Myc-tagged wild-type or mutant PCP-2 were transiently cotransfected into HEK293 cells with wild-type β-catenin or its point mutant Y654E. Twenty-four hours later, cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with antibody specific for β-catenin. After SDS-PAGE of immunoprecipitates, immunoblots were probed for PCP-2 and β-catenin. As shown in Fig. 3D, either wild-type or mutant PCP-2 was efficiently coimmunoprecipitated with β-catenin or its mutant, indicating that their association was independent of PCP-2 catalytic activity or β-catenin tyrosine phosphorylation status. PCP-2 Repressed β-Catenin Activity in Colon Cancer Cell Line—To examine the effects of PCP-2 on β-catenin signaling in detail, we isolated stable clones of SW480 cells expressing Myc-tagged WT-PCP-2 or PCP-2/CS (mu-PCP-2) and characterized them by immunoblotting (Fig. 4A) and by immunofluorescence (Fig. 4B). SW480 cells were chosen for study because they harbor a truncated APC that renders β-catenin resistant to degradation and contains relatively low E-cadherin levels; thus, most of the β-catenin is not retained in the membrane by this molecule (21Gottardi C.J. Wong E. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1049-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Two independent clones for each construct with similar protein expression levels were used for further analysis. Drug-resistant clones of empty vector-transfected cells were pooled to rule out clone-specific effects. As shown in Fig. 4C, exogenous expression of WT-PCP-2 led to a substantial drop in Tcf reporter activities. The inhibitory effect of PCP-2 was partially compromised by inactivation of its catalytic activity, as expected from the above observation that the phosphatase activity was involved in PCP-2-mediated repression of β-catenin signaling (Fig. 3). To directly address whether there was physiological relevance to our finding of decreased β-catenin transactivation, we then evaluated the amounts of c-myc, which was a crucial target for β-catenin/Tcf4-mediated Wnt signaling activities. In Fig. 4, D and E, we showed that exogenous expression of PCP-2 or PCP-2/CS caused a significant reduction in the amounts of c-myc mRNA and protein levels, suggesting that the decreased transcriptional activity is accompanied by specific decreases in gene transcription and that the decrease in c-Myc protein levels occurs at the mRNA level. A ChIP assay was further performed to determine whether PCP-2 signaling caused a direct effect on reducing binding of the β-catenin-Tcf transcription factor to the endogenous c-myc promoter region. Fig. 4F revealed that β-catenin was indeed recruited less to the promoter regions of c-myc gene in the PCP-2-expressing cell pool than in the empty vector control cell pool. These data demonstrate that PCP-2 induced dissociation of β-catenin-Tcf with c-myc promoter and suggest a new function for this RPTP in β-catenin-dependent gene regulation. PCP-2 Directly Associated with β-Catenin and Enhanced Its Stability—To explore the molecular mechanism by which PCP-2 down-regulate β-catenin signaling activity, we first tested whether PCP-2 could associate with E-cadherin/β-catenin complex in SW480 cells. PCP-2 or β-catenin was immunoprecipitated from SW480 cells stably transfected with Myc-tagged WT- or mu-PCP-2. The immunoprecipitates were then analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-β-catenin, anti-E-cadherin, or anti-Myc tag antibodies. As shown in Fig. 5, A and B, both PCP-2 and E-cadherin were found in β-catenin immunoprecipitates, but only β-catenin could be found in PCP-2 immunoprecipitates, indicating that PCP-2 directly associated with β-catenin but not E-cadherin. Note that mu-PCP-2 was able to coimmunoprecipitate with β-catenin to the same extent as WT-PCP-2. We then examined whether the expression of PCP-2 could influence the stability of β-catenin. The cells were treated with cycloheximide to block new protein synthesis; protein extracts were prepared at 0, 3, 6, and 9 h after the block. Western blotting (Fig. 5C) showed that β-catenin was rapidly degraded in empty vector-transfected cells, whereas its levels remained stable in WT- and mu-PCP-2 cells. These data suggest that PCP-2 expression could lead to stabilization of cytosolic pools of β-catenin perhaps by virtue of their physical interaction. Expression of PCP-2 Led to Decreased Free Cytoplasmic β-Catenin and Increased Membrane-associated E-cadherin—To determine whether the reduction in β-catenin/Tcf signaling was due to β-catenin sequestration by PCP-2 from the free competent signaling pool, β-catenin from SW480-derived cells was affinity-precipitated with a GST-E-cadherin cytoplasmic fusion protein, and the levels of free, uncomplexed β-catenin were analyzed by immunoblotting (Fig. 6A). As demonstrated previously, this strategy allows, in contrast to immunoprecipitation, specifically and selectively, the precipitation of the free, non-E-cadherin-bound pool of β-catenin (22Muller T.

https://openalex.org/W2136669302,"Asbestos is a known inflammatory, carcinogenic, and fibrotic agent, but the mechanisms leading to asbestos-induced lung diseases are unclear. Using a murine inhalation model of fibrogenesis, we show that asbestos causes significant increases in mRNA levels of lung matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs 12 and 13) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP1), as well as increased activities of MMP 2, 9, and 12 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALF). Asbestos-exposed PKCdelta knockout (PKCdelta-/-) mice exhibited decreased expression of lung MMP12 and MMP13 compared with asbestos-exposed wild-type mice. Studies using small molecule inhibitors in murine alveolar epithelial type II cells (C10) and primary lung fibroblasts confirmed that asbestos transcriptionally up-regulates MMPs via an EGFR (or other growth factor receptors)/PI3K/PKCdelta/ERK1/2 pathway. Moreover, use of a broad-spectrum MMP inhibitor showed that MMPs play an important role in further enhancing asbestos-induced signaling events by activating EGFR. These data reveal a potentially important link between asbestos signaling and integrity of the extracellular matrix (ECM) that likely contributes to asbestos-induced lung remodeling and diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2017855868,"To gain a broader insight into the role of Bcl-2 proteins in apoptosis induced after mitotic arrest, we investigated the subcellular location, oligomeric structure, and protein interactions of Bax, Bcl-2, and Bcl-xL in vinblastine-treated KB-3 cells. Vinblastine induced the translocation of Bax from the cytosol to the mitochondria, which was accompanied by conformational activation and oligomerization of Bax. Bcl-2 was located in the mitochondria, underwent multisite phosphorylation after vinblastine treatment, and was strictly monomeric under all conditions. In contrast, in control cells, Bcl-xL existed in both monomeric (30 kDa) and oligomeric (150 kDa) forms. Treatment with agents that induced Bcl-xL phosphorylation (microtubule inhibitors) caused loss of the 150-kDa form, but this species was unaffected by apoptotic stimuli that did not stimulate phosphorylation. Vinblastine also promoted Bax activation and Bax oligomerization in HCT116 colon cancer cells. Both wild-type and Bax-deficient HCT116 cells expressed the 150-kDa form of Bcl-xL, which was depleted similarly in both cell lines upon vinblastine treatment. Co-immunoprecipitation studies revealed that in untreated KB-3 cells inactive cytosolic Bax interacted with Bcl-xL, whereas in vinblastine-treated cells, activated mitochondrial Bax did not interact with Bcl-xL. Interaction of Bcl-2 with Bax was not observed under any condition. Overexpression of Bcl-xL inhibited vinblastine-induced Bax activation and Bax dimerization and in parallel inhibited apoptosis. The results indicate that vinblastine-induced apoptosis requires translocation, activation, and oligomerization of Bax and is associated with specific changes in the oligomeric properties of Bcl-xL, which occur independently of Bax.

The results indicate that vinblastine-induced apoptosis requires translocation, activation, and oligomerization of Bax and is associated with specific changes in the oligomeric properties of Bcl-xL, which occur independently of Bax. The Bcl-2 family of proteins are key regulators of apoptosis. Anti-apoptotic members include Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1, A1, Nr-13, and others, and the pro-apoptotic members are represented by two subgroups: the multidomain or Bax subfamily (Bax, Bak, and Bok), which contain multiple BH domains, and the BH3-only subfamily (Bad, Bid, Bim, Noxa, Hrk, and others) (1Kroemer G. Reed J.C. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (2754) Google Scholar, 2Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J.

Huang D.C.S. Cell Res. 2006; 16: 203-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Bcl-2 proteins act in a hierarchy, with the BH3-only proteins acting as essential initiators of apoptosis (4van Delft M.F. Huang D.C.S. Cell Res. 2006; 16: 203-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). In healthy cells they are maintained in a latent state, and in response to apoptotic stimuli they become activated through a variety of mechanisms involving posttranslational modification or transcriptional activation. Activated BH3 proteins play a key role in the activation of multidomain Bax subfamily proteins. This leads to an increase in outer mitochondrial membrane permeability and the release of cytochrome c and other apoptogenic factors (1Kroemer G. Reed J.C. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (2754) Google Scholar, 2Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3238) Google Scholar, 3Cory S.

Cell Res. 2006; 16: 203-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins antagonize the function of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins. Recent work has indicated that BH3-only proteins do not bind promiscuously to pro-survival members but rather bind more selectively, and, in addition to a role in neutralization of pro-survival members, they also bind and may thus directly activate Bax or Bak (4van Delft M.F. Huang D.C.S. Cell Res. 2006; 16: 203-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar).Bax and Bak play redundant functions and are required for mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis in response to death signals (5Wei M.C. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A.J. Roth K.A. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2001; 292: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (3317) Google Scholar). Whereas Bak is mitochondrial, Bax undergoes conformational changes that promote its translocation from the cytosol to the mitochondria. Upon outer mitochondrial membrane association, further structural changes in Bax enable homo-oligomerization and/or interaction with other proteins to facilitate pore formation and the release of apoptosis promoting factors (1Kroemer G. Reed J.C. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (2754) Google Scholar, 2Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J.

Donehower R.C. The Chemotherapy Source Book.2nd Ed. Williams and Wilkins, Baltimore, MD1998: 387-423Google Scholar). At physiological concentrations, these agents have in common the ability to suppress the dynamic instability of spindle microtubules, leading to mitotic arrest and cell death by apoptosis (7Jordan M.A. Wilson L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (3468) Google Scholar). The mechanisms of apoptotic cell death resulting from mitotic arrest are complex and far from resolved (8Blagosklonny M.V. Fojo T. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 83: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 9Wang L.G. Liu X.M. Kreis W. Budman D.R. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1999; 44: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 10Bhalla K.N. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 9075-9086Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Bcl-2 proteins appear to play an important regulatory role. For example, one of the main characteristics of microtubule inhibitors is their ability to promote phosphorylation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL (11Ruvolo P.P. Deng X. May W.S. Leukemia. 2001; 15: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). However, the role of phosphorylation and the kinase(s) responsible remain obscure. Bax has been implicated in apoptosis induced by vinblastine and the nontaxane microtubule inhibitor epothilone (12Yamaguchi H. Chen J. Bhalla K. Wang H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39431-39437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 13Yamaguchi H. Paranawithana S.R. Lee M.W. Huang Z. Bhalla K.N. Wang H.G. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 466-471PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, several studies have indicated that paclitaxel does not promote Bax mitochondrial translocation or Bax activation (14Longuet M. Serduc R. Riva C. Int. J. Oncol. 2004; 25: 309-317PubMed Google Scholar, 15Salah-Eldin A.E. Inoue S. Tsukamoto S. Aoi H. Tsuda M. Int. J. Cancer. 2003; 103: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), despite the fact that Bax expression is a predictor of paclitaxel sensitivity (16Taguchi T. Kato Y. Baba Y. Nishimura G. Tanigaki Y. Horiuchi C. Mochimatsu I. Tsukuda M. Oncol. Rep. 2004; 11: 421-426PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that factors in addition to or other than Bax activation are important for apoptosis induced by microtubule inhibitors. This notion is supported by other results indicating that Bax activation may be necessary but is often insufficient for apoptosis induction (17Makin G.W. Corfe B.M. Griffiths G.J. Thistlethwaite A. Hickman J.A. Dive C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6306-6315Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar).In this study we have undertaken an examination of the subcellular location, oligomeric structure, and protein-protein interactions of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bax in KB-3 cells treated with vinblastine. We show that vinblastine promotes specific changes in the subcellular location, activation status, and oligomeric structure of these key proteins. In particular, we show that although Bcl-2 is monomeric, Bcl-xL also exists in high molecular mass complexes, with discrete changes in their relative abundance evident upon treatment with vinblastine and other microtubule inhibitors. In addition, in response to vinblastine treatment, Bax undergoes mitochondrial translocation accompanied by activation and dimerization, and we provide evidence that these events are necessary for vinblastine-induced apoptosis. These studies reveal key distal steps in apoptosis induction by this important group of chemotherapeutic agents.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Antibodies to caspase 3 (sc-7148), Bcl-2 (sc-509), and actin (sc-1616) were obtained from Santa Cruz; antibodies to Bcl-xL (catalog number 2762) and Bax (catalog number 2772) were from Cell Signaling; antibody to cytochrome c (catalog number 556433) was from Pharmingen; and antibody to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) 3The abbreviations used are: GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; DSP, dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate); PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HA, hemagglutinin; pI, isoelectric point; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. (catalog number 4300) was from Ambion. 6A7 active Bax antibody was from Axxora.

Vinblastine, paclitaxel, vincristine, doxorubicin, etoposide, and other chemicals, unless otherwise stated, were obtained from Sigma.Cell Culture and Transfection—The KB-3 human carcinoma cell line was maintained in monolayer culture at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells stably overexpressing HA-Bcl-xL (human) were prepared by transfecting KB-3 cells, at ∼70% confluence, with 10 μg of plasmid DNA (HA-Bcl-xL-pcDNA3) using Lipofectamine Plus reagent in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. After 3 h, the transfection medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. After an additional 24 h, G418 was added to the medium to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml, and the cells were maintained for 2 weeks. Drug-resistant colonies were selected, expanded, and maintained in growth medium containing 0.4 mg/ml G418. Clones were screened for Bcl-xL and HA immunoreactivity by immunoblotting using specific antibodies. HCT116 parental and Bax knock-out cell lines were maintained in McCoy's 5A medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (12Yamaguchi H. Chen J. Bhalla K. Wang H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39431-39437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar).Preparation of Cell Extracts and Subcellular Fractions—Whole cell extracts were prepared by suspending cells in 0.25 ml of lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.2% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μm pepstatin, 1 μm okadaic acid, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After 15 min on ice, the extracts were sonicated (3 × 10 s), insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (15 min at 12,000 × g), and protein concentration in the supernatant was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay.Cytosolic and mitochondrial extracts were prepared using a fractionation kit from Active Motif (catalog number 40015) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 5 × 107 cells were washed with PBS twice, resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold cytosolic buffer, incubated on ice for 15 min, homogenized with 30 strokes of a pestle homogenizer, and centrifuged at 800 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min, with the supernatant retained as the cytosolic fraction and the pellet as the mitochondria-enriched fraction. The latter was resuspended in the complete mitochondrial buffer provided in the kit.To examine oligomeric forms of Bcl-2 proteins, washed cell pellets were incubated in buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, plus phosphatase and protease inhibitors, as above) containing 0.01% digitonin for 2 min at 4 °C and centrifuged at 15,000 × g. The pellet was extracted with buffer A containing 3% CHAPS for 45 min at 4 °C to release membrane- and organelle-bound proteins, which were isolated in the supernatant after centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min. The samples were prepared for SDS-PAGE under either reduced or nonreduced conditions (with or without β-mercaptoethanol, respectively) with heating to 70 °C for 5 min. In some experiments, the cross-linking agent DSP was added to a final concentration of 1 mm after cell permeabilization. After 10 min at 4 °C, DSP was quenched with 0.1 volume of 2 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). Quantitation of protein expression from immunoblots was performed with a MultiImager densitometry system (Bio-Rad) with background values subtracted in all cases.Immunofluorescent Localization of Bax—KB-3 cells (1.5 × 105 in 1 ml of medium) were grown on 25-mm glass coverslips placed in each well of a 6-well tissue culture plate. Following treatment, mitochondria were stained for 30 min at 37 °C with Mitotracker Red CMXRos (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) diluted 1:1000 in growth media. The cells were then fixed and permeablized for 30 min at room temperature in fixing medium (3.7% paraformaldehyde, 0.18% Triton X-100 in PBS) and then blocked for 30 min in blocking buffer (5% bovine serum albumin, 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS). The cells were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with rabbit polyclonal anti-Bax primary antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), diluted 1:100 in 5% bovine serum albumin/PBS, and then washed with PBS (3 × 5 min). Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) secondary antibody (Molecular Probes), diluted 1:50 in 5% bovine serum albumin/PBS, was added to cells for 1 h at room temperature, and the cells were washed with PBS (3 × 5 min). The coverslips were removed from the 6-well plates and mounted on glass microscope slides using 25 μl of Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Immunofluorescent protein and mitochondria were visualized using 488- and 568-nm laser lines of a Zeiss LSM410 confocal microscope.Immunoprecipitation—To evaluate Bax activation status, the cells were lysed in 0.5 ml of 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% CHAPS, plus protease inhibitors (as above) for 30 min on ice. After brief sonication, the cell extract was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min, and 500 μg of cell lysate mixed with 2 μg of 6A7 monoclonal Bax antibody in 500 μl of lysis buffer overnight at 4 °C. The lysates were then incubated with 25 μl of protein G-agarose beads (Invitrogen) for 2 h at 4°C. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation and washed three times with 0.2 ml of lysis buffer. The beads were resuspended in 20 μl of lysis buffer plus 5 μlof5× SDS loading buffer and electrophoresed on 12% SDS-PAGE gold precast acrylamide gels (Cambrex, Walkersville, MD). Following electrophoresis, immunoblotting was performed using rabbit anti-Bax polyclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) at 1:1000 dilution.To examine Bcl-2 protein interactions by co-immunoprecipitation, the cells were lysed in 0.3 ml of 40 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.12 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, containing phosphatase and protease inhibitors as above, and after 30 min on ice centrifuged at 9,200 × g for 20 min. The extract (1.5–2 mg) was precleared with anti-rabbit goat IgG agarose beads, according to the manufacturer's directions (eBiosciences), and to the supernatant was added 10 μg of rabbit polyclonal antibody (to either Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL). After mixing for 2 h, anti-rabbit goat IgG-agarose beads were added and mixed overnight. The immunoprecipitate was then washed five times in the following buffers: (a) TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20; (b) 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 40 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100; (c) 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 40 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5 m LiCl; (d) 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 40 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 m LiCl; and (e) 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl. The immunoprecipitates were incubated in SDS-PAGE sample buffer for 1 h at 37°C and resolved by 12.5% acrylamide SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Immunoblotting was performed with monoclonal mouse Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, or Bax antibody.Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis—KB-3 cells (∼109 cells, derived from two 150-mm plates) were washed in PBS and resuspended in 0.6 ml of osmotic lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.3% SDS). The suspension was passed through a 1-ml syringe fitted with a 25-gauge needle 10–15 times, incubated on ice for 30 min, and sonicated 3 × 10 s, and after determination of the protein concentration, the samples were diluted to 10 μg of protein/μl. The samples were diluted 1:1 with 60 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 5% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, heated to 95 °C for 5 min, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was performed according to the method of O'Farrell (18O'Farrell P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by Kendrick Labs, Inc. (Madison, WI). Isoelectric focusing was carried out in 2-mm glass tubes for 9600 volt-h. For the analysis of Bcl-2, 2% pH 3.5–10 ampholines were used, and for the analysis of Bcl-xL, a mixture of 1% pH 2.2–5 and 1% pH 4–6 ampholines was used. A surface pH electrode was used to determine the pH gradient of the isoelectric focusing tube gel. After equilibration in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 10% glycerol, and 2.3% SDS, SDS-PAGE in the second dimension was performed using 10% acrylamide gels. After transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, immunoblotting was performed for Bcl-xL or Bcl-2. Molecular mass standards were catalase (60 kDa), actin (43 kDa), and carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa).Apoptosis Assays—KB-3 cells were trypsinized following drug treatment and diluted to a concentration of 5 × 104 cells/ml for measurement of apoptosis using a cell death detection enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Roche Applied Science). This is a quantitative photometric immunoassay for the determination of cytoplasmic histone-associated oligonucleosomes generated during apoptosis. After dilution, the cells were centrifuged at 200 × g for 5 min, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 0.5 ml of incubation buffer and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. After centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min, 0.4 ml of the supernatant was removed and diluted 1:10 in incubation buffer for analysis. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate was prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions, and 0.1 ml of sample was added to appropriate wells and incubated at room temperature for 90 min. After conjugation and incubation with substrate solution, the plate was shaken on an orbital shaker at 250 rpm for ∼15 min, and then the absorbance at 405 nm was determined using a Bio-Tek ELx800 microplate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Winooski, VT). Apoptosis was also evaluated by quantitation of sub-G1 DNA content after propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry, as described previously (19Du L. Lyle C.S. Chambers T.C. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).RESULTSSubcellular Localization of Bcl-2 Proteins—Cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions were prepared from control and vinblastine-treated KB-3 cells to determine the subcellular location of Bax and to monitor any changes associated with drug treatment. The integrity of the fractions was demonstrated by immunoblotting for caspase 3, which was detected in the cytosolic fraction and not in the mitochondrial fraction, and for cytochrome c, which was detected in the mitochondrial fraction and not in the cytosolic fraction (Fig. 1A). Previous studies have shown in untreated KB-3 cells that Bcl-2 is present in the mitochondrial fraction and not in the cytosolic fraction and that Bcl-xL is present in both the mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions (19Du L. Lyle C.S. Chambers T.C. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The subcellular locations of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL are unchanged after vinblastine treatment, although both proteins undergo gel mobility shifts caused by phosphorylation (19Du L. Lyle C.S. Chambers T.C. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Bax, on the other hand, was mainly present in the cytosol of control cells and underwent mitochondrial translocation in response to vinblastine treatment, first evident at 24 h and more prominent at later time points (Fig. 1B). Release of cytochrome c to the cytosol was evident with a similar time course (Fig. 1C). Actin served as a loading control (Fig. 1C). Previous studies have shown that under these conditions, apoptosis, as judged by caspase 3 activation, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, and DNA fragmentation, is evident beginning at 24 h of treatment and continuing through 48 h (19Du L. Lyle C.S. Chambers T.C. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).To confirm vinblastine-induced mitochondrial translocation of Bax, control and vinblastine-treated cells were fixed and immunostained for Bax, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The mitochondria were stained using Mitotracker Red. As shown in Fig. 2, in control untreated cells, Bax immunofluorescence, shown by the green signal, was distinct in location compared with the red mitochondrial signal. However, after vinblastine treatment, the green Bax signal coincided with the red mitochondrial signal, indicating and confirming Bax mitochondrial localization.FIGURE 2Immunofluorescent localization of Bax. KB-3 cells were untreated (control) or treated with 30 nm vinblastine for 36 h, fixed, and permeabilized. Mitochondria (red signal) were visualized with Mitotracker Red, and Bax (green signal) was localized by immunofluorescence, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The images were taken with a Zeiss LSM410 confocal microscope.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Bax Activation and Oligomerization—To determine whether Bax mitochondrial translocation was associated with Bax activation, active Bax was immunoprecipitated under native conditions from control and vinblastine-treated cells. For immunoprecipitation we used the anti-Bax 6A7 antibody, which recognizes the conformationally active form of Bax, and immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting using a non-conformation-dependent Bax antibody. As shown in Fig. 3A, the active form of Bax was readily detected in cells treated with vinblastine for 36 h and also to a much lower extent in cells treated with vinblastine for 24 h, consistent with the profile of Bax mitochondrial translocation (Fig. 1), whereas active Bax was not detected in control cells. Active Bax was not observed when 6A7 antibody was omitted during immunoprecipitation, and additional controls showed equivalent Bax protein expression in whole cell extracts (Fig. 3A).FIGURE 3Vinblastine induces activation and dimerization of Bax. A, KB-3 cells were untreated or treated with 30 nm vinblastine (VBL) for the times indicated and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Bax 6A7 antibody (lanes 3, 6, and 9), followed by immunoblotting for Bax. Precipitates prepared in the absence of 6A7 antibody (lanes 2, 5, and 8) and whole cell extracts (lanes 1, 4, and 7) were also examined as controls. B, KB-3 cells were treated with vinblastine (VBL, 30 nm) for the times indicated, permeabilized, treated with digitonin in the absence or presence of 1 mm DSP, and CHAPS-solubilized particulate fractions subjected to SDS-PAGE. Immunoblotting for Bax was performed with the monomeric (21-kDa) and oligomeric (42-kDa) forms shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Studies in other systems have indicated that Bax activation is often associated with Bax oligomerization. For example, ATP depletion induced by hypoxia results in dimerization and higher oligomerization of Bax (20Mikhailov V. Mikhailova M. Pulkrabek D.J. Dong Z. Venkatachalam M.A. Saikumar P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18361-18374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). To determine whether vinblastine induced Bax oligomerization, KB-3 cells were treated with or without vinblastine, permeabilized with digitonin, and then incubated with or without the cross-linking agent, DSP, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Particulate fractions were prepared and extracted with CHAPS, and samples were subjected to immunoblotting for Bax. As shown in Fig. 3B, Bax migrated as a monomer of 21 kDa in control cells; however, after 36-h vinblastine treatment, a proportion of Bax also migrated at 42 kDa. The 42-kDa form was only observed following DSP treatment and in the absence of β-mercaptoethanol. When the cross-linker was cleaved under reducing conditions with β-mercaptoethanol, the 42-kDa species was absent (data not shown), suggesting that this species indeed represented a higher molecular mass complex of Bax, possibly a dimer.Vinblastine Treatment Alters the Oligomeric Structure of Bcl-xL—The samples shown in Fig. 3 were also subjected to immunoblotting for Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. No oligomeric forms of Bcl-2 were detected following either vinblastine treatment or DSP treatment (Fig. 4A, top panel). Under each condition, Bcl-2 migrated as a monomer with an apparent molecular mass of 23 kDa, with vinblastine inducing phosphorylation-dependent mobility shifts, as shown previously (19Du L. Lyle C.S. Chambers T.C. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In contrast, discrete species of differing molecular masses were found when these CHAPS-solubilized particulate fractions were probed for Bcl-xL (Fig. 4A, lower panel). In control cells, a substantial proportion of Bcl-xL migrated with an apparent molecular mass of 150 kDa compared with the 30-kDa monomeric form. In addition, several species in the range of 50–70 kDa were also observed. The 150-kDa species was eliminated by DSP treatment, suggesting that the relevant protein complex is disrupted or unstable in the presence of the chemical cross-linking reagent. Interestingly, the 150-kDa species was also eliminated after vinblastine treatment, which promotes Bcl-xL phosphorylation (19Du L. Lyle C.S. Chambers T.C. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), also evident as a mobility shift of the monomeric form in Fig. 4A. Only the monomeric form of Bcl-xL was present after treatment of samples with β-mercaptoethanol to reverse the cross-links (Fig. 4A, lower panel, right two lanes).FIGURE 4Vinblastine and other microtubule inhibitors induce alterations in Bcl-xL oligomerization. A, samples were prepared as described in the legend to Fig. 3B and subjected to immunoblotting for Bcl-2 (top panel) or Bcl-xL (lower panel), as indicated."

One such group of proteins, the small multidrug resistance family, are drug/proton antiporters that must oligomerize to function, a process that requires the assembly of at least two inactive monomers by intermolecular association of their four transmembrane helices. Here, we have used peptides that correspond to each of the four wild type transmembrane helices of the Halobacterium salinarum protein Hsmr and a corresponding library of mutant peptides to determine the interactive surfaces that likely contribute to protein oligomerization. Hsmr peptides were examined for strong (sodium dodecyl sulfate-resistant) and weaker (perfluorooctanoate-resistant) helix-helix interactions, in conjunction with circular dichroism, fluorescence energy transfer measurements, and molecular modeling. The results are compatible with a scheme in which two faces of helix four permit self-assembly via a higher affinity asymmetric pairing and a lower affinity symmetric interaction, resulting in a discrete tetramer. Our finding that two surfaces of helix four can contribute to the stability of small multidrug resistance protein assembly provides a molecular basis for the design of therapeutics that target this antibiotic resistance mechanism.

The monomer of the best characterized family member, the Escherichia coli SMR protein EmrE, is a tightly packed bundle of four antiparallel transmembrane (TM) α-helices with short loops (6Arkin I.T.

Schuldiner S. Kessler H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 610-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The minimum structural unit of EmrE is a dimer that is unusual in that its component monomers have distinct conformations (8Tate C.G. Kunji E.R. Lebendiker M. Schuldiner S.

It is also unresolved whether the pre-existence of alternate monomer folds is required for, or is the consequence of, multimer formation. Although the in vivo oligomeric state of EmrE may be a dimer of dimers (11Ma C. Chang G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2852-2857Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 14Elbaz Y.

A detailed understanding of the TM helix-helix interactions that stabilize the self-assembly of SMR drug pumps is thus of considerable interest in the development of therapeutics that could target this resistance mechanism by disrupting SMR oligomerization. Like other multimeric membrane proteins, SMRs are stabilized by weak (van der Waals and electrostatic) intermolecular interactions between TM helix faces, defined as individual sets of residues on distinct surfaces of each α-helical TM segment (16Popot J.L. Engelman D.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4031-4037Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). The intermolecular helix-helix interactions that assemble SMR oligomers vary in strength among family members (17Ninio S. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12000-12005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) but are of sufficient stability in the Halobacterium salinarum homolog Hsmr to resist the strongly denaturing conditions of SDS-PAGE that disrupt oligomerization of EmrE (17Ninio S. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12000-12005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The SDS-resistant Hsmr dimer thus allows for the detection of key SMR intermolecular interactions that could be denatured in its less stable counterparts. We have independently been studying Hsmr as a model system, using peptides that correspond to each of its four wild type (WT) TM helices, along with a corresponding library of mutant peptides. Here, we examine these Hsmr TM peptides for stronger (sodium dodecyl sulfate-resistant) and weaker (sodium perfluorooctanoate-resistant) TM-TM interactions, in conjunction with CD and fluorescence energy transfer (FRET) measurements and molecular modeling, to show that helix four has two interactive surfaces that may contribute to the stability of SMR protein oligomers. Peptide Synthesis and Purification—Prediction of Hsmr TM segments was performed using the program TM Finder (18Deber C.M. Wang C. Liu L.P. Prior A.S. Agrawal S. Muskat B.L. Cuticchia A.J.

Lysine-tagged peptides corresponding to Hsmr residues 2–24 (TM-1), 30–51 (TM-2), 56–79 (TM-3), and 85–105 (TM-4) with the sequences K-HPYAYLAAAIAAEVAGTTALKLS-K, KK-PAPSVVVLVGYVSSFYFLGLVL-KKK, KKK-VGVVYGTWAAVGIVATALVGVVF-KKK, and KKK-VAGVVGLALIVAGVVVLNVAS-KK were synthesized with a Pioneer peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems) using standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry (19Amblard M.

The lysine residues added to each peptide sequence were not anticipated to affect peptide orientation or stoichiometry (20Melnyk R.A. Partridge A.W. Deber C.M.

Labeling with 4-dimethylaminoazobenzene -4′-sulfonyl chloride (dabcyl chloride), 5-dimethylamino-1-naphthalenesulfonyl chloride (dansyl chloride), or 5- (and 6-) carboxytetramethylrhodamine succinimidyl ester (TAMRA-SE) (Molecular Probes) was accomplished by incubating the resin-bound peptide with excess label under basic conditions overnight. Cleaved peptides were purified by reverse phase-high pressure liquid chromatography on a C4 preparative column (Phenomenex). Mass spectrometry was used to confirm the molecular weight of the purified peptides, and the Micro BCA assay (Pierce) was used to determine concentration. Peptide Electrophoresis—SDS-PAGE on precast NuPAGE gels containing 12% acrylamide in MES buffer (Invitrogen) was performed on 2 μg of peptide samples in homooligomerization experiments. One μgof unlabeled peptide was mixed with 1 μg of TAMRA-labeled peptide samples before loading gels in SDS-PAGE heterooligomerization experiments to keep total peptide concentration identical to that of unlabeled peptides. Sodium perfluorooctanoate (PFO)-PAGE was performed as described (24Ramjeesingh M. Huan L.J. Garami E. Bear C.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) on precast Tris-Glycine gels containing 18% acrylamide in Tris-Glycine buffer (Invitrogen). A total peptide concentration of 2 μg was used in PFO-PAGE experiments with unlabeled peptides; heterooligomerization of labeled peptides was performed as described above. Coomassie Blue staining was used on all gels to visualize peptides and was used in conjunction with UV transillumination to detect TAMRA-labeled peptides in heterooligomerization experiments. Densitometry measurements were performed using NIH Image. CD and Fluorescence Measurements—CD spectra in buffer and SDS were recorded in a 0.1-cm path length cuvette on a Jasco J-720 circular dichroism spectropolarimeter at peptide concentrations of 20–50 μm in SDS and in a 0.01-cm path length cuvette at peptide concentrations of 50–100 μm in PFO. The mean residue ellipticity expected for peptides in a 100% helical conformation was calculated using the formula max[θ]222=[(n−4.6)(−40,000)]/n where n is the number of residues in the peptide (25Chen Y.H. Yang J.T. Chau K.H. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3350-3359Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar, 26Gans P.J. Lyu P.C. Manning M.C. Woody R.W. Kallenbach N.R. Biopolymers. 1991; 31: 1605-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). According to this relation, the mean residue ellipticities (deg cm2 dmol–1 res–1) at 222 nm corresponding to 100% helical conformations are –32,640 (TM-1); –33,185 (TM-2); –33,867 (TM-3); and –32,923 (TM-4). For FRET quenching experiments, a 1 μm solution of dansyl-labeled peptide (donor fluor) was mixed with 0–4μm of the corresponding dabcyl-labeled peptide (acceptor) in SDS or PFO micelles and allowed to equilibrate at room temperature overnight. Total peptide concentration was kept constant at 5 μm by the addition of the appropriate concentration of unlabeled peptide. Emission spectra were obtained in a 1-cm path length cuvette by exciting the dansyl fluor at an excitation wavelength of 341 nm with a 2 nm bandpass and monitoring emission from 450 to 650 nm with a 4 nm bandpass at each point in the titration on a Photon Technology International C-60 spectrofluorimeter. Spectra were integrated between 450 and 650 nm using the FELIX software provided by the manufacturer. Integrated total fluorescence intensities at each point in the titration (F) were normalized by the initial integrated total fluorescence intensity in the presence of 0 μm acceptor peptide (Fo). Mole fraction acceptor (Pa) was calculated according to the relation Pa=[acceptorpeptide]/[totalpeptide] Data were fit as described (27Adair B.D. Engelman D.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5539-5544Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) using the program Kaleidagraph. In FRET competition experiments, a 1 μm dansyl-labeled peptide solution was mixed with: 1 μm unlabeled peptide; 1 μm dabcyl-labeled peptide; or 1 μm dabcyl and 2 μm unlabeled peptide. CD and fluorescence measurements were performed in buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 10 mm NaCl), buffer with 20 mm SDS, or buffer with 50 mm PFO. Molecular Modeling—Energy-minimized models of the interaction between two helices corresponding to Hsmr residues 85–105 (TM-4) were produced as described (28Wang C. Deber C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16155-16159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Design of Hsmr TM Peptides—We selected a peptide-based approach to evaluate helix-helix contacts in Hsmr because SMR proteins have short connecting loops between TM segments (5–9 residues in length based on NMR helix boundary assignments (7Schwaiger M.

Biochem. 1998; 254: 610-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar)) and must therefore be predominantly stabilized by intermolecular TM helix-helix contacts. This technique permits parallel and antiparallel helix-helix interactions to be detected, an ideal methodology for SMR oligomers that may assemble with inverted topologies (5Ubarretxena-Belandia I.

Peptides corresponding to each WT TM segment of Hsmr were initially synthesized, with boundaries selected by referring to NMR α-helix assignments in EmrE (7Schwaiger M. Lebendiker M. Yerushalmi H.

The peptides synthesized (TM-1, residues 2–24; TM-2, 36–55; TM-3, 56–79; TM-4, 85–105; see “Experimental Procedures” for sequences) incorporate multiple lysine residues at their N and C termini following the “Lys tag” technique (20Melnyk R.A.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11106-11113Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) that increases peptide solubility while preserving the in vivo oligomeric stoichiometry and native helix-helix interfaces of TM segments (20Melnyk R.A.

Folding of Hsmr TM Peptides in Membrane-mimetic Environments—CD spectra of the four WT Hsmr peptides in the presence and absence of SDS or PFO micelles are shown in Fig. 1. With the exception of TM-2, which had a broad minimum centered near 210 nm, each Hsmr TM peptide displayed CD spectra consistent with a random-coil conformation in aqueous buffer (Fig. 1A). The TM-1, TM-3, and TM-4 peptides had α-helical CD spectra with minima at 208 and 222 nm in the presence of SDS (Fig. 1B) or PFO (Fig. 1C), secondary structure consistent with the conformation of native SMR proteins. The spectrum of TM-2, however, had a broad minimum centered at ∼217 nm in SDS and PFO micelles (Fig. 1, B and C), characteristic of β-strand conformation; its role in the self-assembly of Hsmr was therefore not investigated further. Homo- and Heterooligomerization of Hsmr TM Peptides in SDS—Oligomerization of the TM-1, TM-3, and/or TM-4 peptides was evaluated by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2). TM-1 is monomeric and TM-4 is dimeric in the 12% NuPAGE system (Fig. 2A), suggesting that the TM-1/TM-1 contacts described in SMR proteins (29Soskine M. Steiner-Mordoch S. Schuldiner S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12043-12048Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), although important for function (5Ubarretxena-Belandia I. Tate C.G. FEBS Lett. 2004; 564: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), may not stabilize the SDS-resistant Hsmr oligomer. Note that the molecular masses of the three constructs vary (TM-1 and TM-4, 2.56 kDa; TM-3, 3.12 kDa), and their migration rates on the gel are thus not comparable. Further, although TM-1 and TM-3 report oligomeric states >1.0 under some conditions, the TM-4 peptide is consistently dimeric (Fig. 2A) (or tetrameric (vide infra)) throughout our experiments and has been identified as an intermolecular contact site in EmrE (29Soskine M. Steiner-Mordoch S. Schuldiner S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12043-12048Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This intriguing ability of The TM-4 peptide to form discrete dimers and tetramers led us to explore the role of TM-4 in Hsmr stabilization in the remainder of this study. All combinations of TM-1, TM-3, and TM-4 were tested for their ability to form SDS-resistant heterooligomers. Unlabeled TM-1, TM-3, or TM-4 peptides were “mixed and matched” in equimolar ratios with peptides labeled with the UV-fluorescent dye TAMRA; here, co-migration of the labeled peptide with its unlabeled counterpart is indicative of heterooligomerization (20Melnyk R.A. Partridge A.W. Deber C.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11106-11113Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Each TAMRA-labeled peptide had a migration pattern similar to its unlabeled counterpart, and co-migration of unlabeled and TAMRA-labeled peptides was not observed for any combination of the TM-1, TM-3, and/or TM-4 peptides (compare Fig. 2B and 2C). We therefore concluded that, although intermolecular TM-1/TM-4 contacts have been described in EmrE (12Pornillos O. Chen Y.J. Chen A.P. Chang G. Science. 2005; 310: 1950-1953Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 29Soskine M. Steiner-Mordoch S. Schuldiner S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12043-12048Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), heterooligomeric pairs of TM-1, TM-3, and/or TM-4 might not be mediating SDS-resistant dimer formation in Hsmr. Homo- and Heterooligomerization of Hsmr TM Peptides in PFO—The ability of the TM-1, TM-3, and TM-4 peptides to homo- and heterooligomerize in PFO micelles was also tested (Fig. 3). PFO is a “mild” detergent that preserves helix-helix interactions denatured by SDS (21Therien A.G. Deber C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6067-6072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and PFO-PAGE can preserve the native quaternary structures of membrane proteins (24Ramjeesingh M. Huan L.J. Garami E. Bear C.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). We therefore expected PFO to preserve the SDS-resistant TM-4 dimer and also permit the formation of any lower affinity helix-helix interactions among the Hsmr peptides. Oligomerization of TM-1 and TM-3 in PFO-PAGE was unchanged when compared with SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3A). The TM-4 peptide, however, migrated as a tetramer (Fig. 3A). Since any interaction strong enough to resist SDS denaturation should persist in PFO (21Therien A.G. Deber C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6067-6072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 24Ramjeesingh M. Huan L.J. Garami E. Bear C.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that TM-4 self-assembles via at least two sets of intermolecular interactions, one that is SDS-sensitive, but permitted in PFO, and another that is resistant to denaturation by both SDS and PFO. “Mix and match” experiments for heterooligomerization on PFO-PAGE were performed on both unlabeled (Fig. 3B) and TAMRA-labeled and unlabeled TM peptides (Fig. 3, C and D). TAMRA labeling did not affect gel migration of TM-1, TM-3, and TM-4 when compared with unlabeled peptide (compare Fig. 3A and 3D). Migration of the unlabeled TM-1, TM-3, and TM-4 peptides was also unchanged when mixed and matched (compare Fig. 3A and 3B), and co-migration was not observed for all possible combinations of TAMRA-labeled and unlabeled peptides (compare Fig. 3C and 3D). These results are consistent with two possibilities: either the surface(s) of TM-4 that mediate homooligomerization do not bind TM-1 and/or TM-3 or any potential TM-1/TM-4 or TM-3/TM-4 interactions are of lower affinity than TM-4/TM-4 self-associations. TM-4 Stoichiometry Determined by Fluorescence Energy Transfer—The stoichiometry of TM-4 oligomerization was tested in FRET experiments in SDS or PFO micelles (Fig. 4). In these assays, co-localization of the peptides within 30 Ä, indicative of peptide oligomerization, results in energy transfer and a stoichiometry-dependent quenching of the dansyl group fluorescence by the dabcyl acceptor group (27Adair B.D. Engelman D.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5539-5544Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Little fluorescence quenching is expected for peptides that are monomeric, a linear relationship between dansyl fluorescence yield and acceptor peptide concentration is expected for dimers, and a non-linear relationship is indicative of higher order oligomers (27Adair B.D. Engelman D.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5539-5544Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Within experimental error, no change in the total fluorescence yield between 450 and 650 nm from the dansyl-TM-1 peptide after excitation at 341 nm was observed upon titration with an increasing proportion of dabcyl-TM-1 in SDS (Fig. 4A) or PFO (Fig. 4B), confirming that TM-1 is monomeric and acting as a negative control for oligomerization in the FRET assay. The linear decrease observed in dansyl-TM-4 peptide fluorescence upon titration with acceptor peptide in SDS is diagnostic of dimer formation of and fits to a stoichiometry of 2.3 ± 0.1 units/oligomer with an R-value of 0.996 (Fig. 4A), whereas the non-linear decrease in dansyl-TM-4 fluorescence yield observed in PFO micelles fits to a stoichiometry of 3.2 ± 0.2 units/oligomer with an R-value of 0.998 (Fig. 4B). These PFO data mirror the 3:1 protein:substrate stoichiometry described for ligand binding by SMR proteins in vivo (30Muth T.R. Schuldiner S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 234-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) and interpreted as representing an equilibrium between dimers and tetramers (14Elbaz Y. Steiner-Mordoch S. Danieli T. Schuldiner S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1519-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Formation of Tetramers by TM-4 Requires the Interaction of Two Helix Faces—For the TM-4 peptide to form oligomers with greater than dimeric stoichiometry, it must have at least two helix surfaces capable of intermolecular interactions as oligomerization cannot proliferate beyond a dimer if a single interaction-competent face exists on each TM-4 helix (Fig. 5A). However, if two helix surfaces interact in a pair-wise or symmetric manner with their counterparts, the stoichiometry of the resulting multimer is difficult to control (Fig. 5B). Such unchecked oligomerization, which would be visible on gels as “laddering” of the TM-4 peptide to oligomers of undefined size, is not observed in our experiments. Two sets of conditions exist in which TM-4 stoichiometry can be restricted to a discrete tetramer: (i) if symmetric interactions are not possible, and each interaction-competent face participates in asymmetric contacts (Fig. 5C) or (ii) if a limited combination of symmetric and asymmetric contacts is permitted (Fig. 5D). Our search for the contact site(s) of TM-4 was guided by evidence for symmetric TM-4/TM-4 contacts observed in oligomeric EmrE (29Soskine M. Steiner-Mordoch S. Schuldiner S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12043-12048Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) on a surface that we have termed the “Ala-Val face” (Fig. 6). The role of this surface in TM-4 self-assembly was assessed with mutant peptides in which two Ala-Val face residues, Ala-92 and Val-95, as well as an adjacent residue, Val-85, were substituted singly and/or in combination with their corresponding residues from EmrE. Because the EmrE dimer is denatured in SDS (13Ninio S. Elbaz Y. Schuldiner S. FEBS Lett. 2004; 562: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), these replacements were expected to disrupt TM-4 dimerization. The resulting mutants, A92M, V95S, A92M/V95S, and V85L, had CD spectra essentially identical to WT TM-4 (data not shown), and all but V85L reduced the affinity of TM-4 dimers on SDS-PAGE gels, evidenced by the appearance of a monomeric species (Fig. 7A). Relative band intensities determined by densitometry measurements show that the A92M, V95S, and A92M/V95S mutants reduce dimerization to ∼50% of WT levels (Table 1). Each of these mutants also exhibited decreased or eliminated fluorescence quenching when compared with WT in FRET experiments (Fig. 7B). Not every Ala-Val face residue capable of bridging monomers (29Soskine M. Steiner-Mordoch S. Schuldiner S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12043-12048Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) contributes to TM-4/TM-4 affinity, however; a peptide containing an Asn-102 to Ala replacement (Fig. 6) remained dimeric on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 7A) and in FRET experiments (Fig. 7B). As Asn residues are typical mediators of SDS-resistant helix-helix association (31Gratkowski H. Lear J.D. DeGrado W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 880-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 32Zhou F.X. Merianos H.J. Brunger A.T. Engelman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2250-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the TM-4 dimer was stabilized via strong van der Waals, rather than electrostatic, interactions (33Johnson R.M. Heslop C.L. Deber C.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 14361-14369Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar).FIGURE 7Homooligomerization of Hsmr TM-4 mutants in SDS. A, SDS-PAGE of WT and mutant TM-4 peptides. Gold and green asterisks indicate residue substitutions on the Ala-Val face and Gly face, respectively. Oligomeric states are indicated to the right. Although the V95S mutant is loaded at a concentration equivalent to the other peptides, it consistently displays reduced staining by Coomassie Blue in SDS gels (data not shown) and therefore appears as a less intense band.

The human TRAP/Mediator complex is an evolutionarily conserved multisubunit coactivator that plays a central role in regulating transcription from protein-encoding genes (1Malik S. Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 277-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). By virtue of its ability to directly interact with both gene-specific transcription factors and RNA polymerase II, TRAP/Mediator acts as an adaptor between promoter-bound activators and the basal transcription machinery. Human complexes similar to TRAP/Mediator have been isolated from several laboratories and include DRIP, ARC, NAT, and human Mediator (reviewed in Refs. 2Malik S. Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem.

In fact, TRAP220/MED1 is amplified in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cells and may play an oncogenic role in steroid hormone-dependent cancer progression (15Zhu Y. Qi C. Jain S. Beau M.M. Le Espinosa 3rd, R. Atkins G.B. Lazar M.A. Yeldandi A.V. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10848-10853Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 16Zhang X.

Consistent with an important physiological role in animal development, ablation of the Trap220/Med1 gene in mice is embryonic lethal (17Zhu Y. Qi C. Jia Y. Nye J.S. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14779-14782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 18Ito M. Yuan C.X. Okano H.J. Darnell R.B. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 683-693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Trap220/Med1–/– mouse embryos exhibit retarded cellular proliferation, whereas embryonic fibroblasts (isolated prior to embryonic death) like-wise display impaired cell cycle progression (18Ito M. Yuan C.X. Okano H.J. Darnell R.B. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 683-693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we recently found that TRAP220/MED1 is a direct target for mitogen-activated protein kinases and becomes phosphorylated and activated in a cell cycle-dependent manner (19Pandey P.K. Udayakumar T.S. Lin X. Sharma D. Shapiro P.S. Fondell J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 10695-10710Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These studies thus suggest that in addition to NR coactivation, TRAP220/MED1 might also facilitate a coregulatory role in mitotic cell growth. In agreement with this view, TRAP220/MED1 has been shown to interact with a number of transcription factors essential for cell growth and development including the GATA family of proteins (20Crawford S.E. Qi C. Misra P. Stellmach V. Rao M.S. Engel J.D. Zhu Y. Reddy J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3585-3592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), BRCA-1 (21Wada O. Oishi H. Takada I. Yanagisawa J. Yano T. Kato S. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 6000-6005Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and p53 (22Frade R. Balbo M. Barel M. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6585-6589PubMed Google Scholar). Nonetheless, little is known about the underlying mechanisms by which TRAP220/MED1 facilitates cell growth nor which specific target genes are involved. Although the importance of TRAP220/MED1 in cell growth and development is clear, its presence within TRAP/Mediator is not critical for the overall functional integrity of the complex. Indeed, TRAP/Mediator subcomplexes lacking TRAP220/MED1 are still capable of facilitating activator-dependent transcription (9Taatjes D.J. Tjian R. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 675-683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 10Malik S. Guermah M. Yuan C.X. Wu W. Yamamura S. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8244-8254Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and are similar in subunit composition to complexes containing the subunit (10Malik S. Guermah M. Yuan C.X. Wu W. Yamamura S. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8244-8254Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Hence, the absence of TRAP220/MED1 does not grossly disrupt the TRAP/Mediator complex nor impair the apparent functional activity of the remaining Mediator subunits. Consistent with this notion, electron micrograph studies of purified human Mediator complexes shows that TRAP220/MED1 assumes a relatively peripheral location on the intact complex (9Taatjes D.J. Tjian R. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 675-683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Collectively, these findings suggest that TRAP220/MED1 is variably associated with the TRAP/Mediator complex in vivo and likely plays a specialized role in selectively recruiting the complex to specific target genes. The Aurora family of kinases are evolutionarily conserved and essential for mitotic cell division in eukaryotes because of their key regulatory roles in centrosome cycling, spindle assembly, chromosome segregation, and cytokinesis (reviewed in Ref. 23Meraldi P. Honda R. Nigg E.A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2004; 14: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). In mammals, Aurora-A kinase (also termed AIK, STK6, or STK15) is mainly located at the mitotic spindle where it regulates the centrosome and mitotic microtubules. Aurora-A has attracted significant attention since the discovery of its overexpression in several human cancer types, and the demonstration of its ability to induce oncogenic transformation in mammalian cells (reviewed in Ref. 24Marumoto T. Zhang D. Saya H. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 42-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Expression of Aurora-A occurs in a cell cycle-dependent manner with peak levels of mRNA and protein occurring at the G2/M phase of the cell cycle (25Crane R. Kloepfer A. Ruderman J.V. J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 10719-10726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Amplification of Aurora-A impairs spindle assembly and disrupts the fidelity of centrosome duplication resulting in aneuploidy, genomic instability, and ultimately leads cellular transformation (23Meraldi P. Honda R. Nigg E.A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2004; 14: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 24Marumoto T. Zhang D. Saya H. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 42-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Here, in an effort to better understand how TRAP220/MED1 selectively targets TRAP/Mediator to physiologically important genes, we used RNA interference (RNAi) together with gene microarray to identify specific genes that are affected by the loss of TRAP220/MED1. We report that human Aurora-A was among the subset of cell growth regulatory genes shown to be down-regulated in TRAP220/MED1-depleted HeLa cells. Importantly, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and cotransfection assays show that TRAP220/MED1 is directly recruited to, and functionally coregulates transcription from, the Aurora-A gene promoter in vivo. Furthermore, we present evidence suggesting that TRAP220/MED1-containing TRAP/Mediator complexes are recruited to the Aurora-A promoter via the Ets-related transcription factor GABP. In summary, these findings suggest that TRAP220/MED1 plays a novel coregulatory role in facilitating the recruitment of TRAP/Mediator to specific target genes involved in growth and cell cycle progression. Antibodies—Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against TRAP220/MED1 and TRAP100/MED24 were described previously (29Zhang J. Fondell J.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1130-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Antibodies against α-tubulin, Aurora-A kinase, TRAP80/MED17, MED6, GABPα, TFIIB, and the HA-epitope were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Mouse monoclonal antibodies against the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II were via the hybridoma 8WG16 provided by Richard Burgess (University of Wisconsin). Plasmids—The mammalian expression vectors pBK-CMV-FLAG-TRα and pSG5-HA-TRAP220 and the luciferase reporter gene 2xT3RE-tk-Luc were described previously (29Zhang J. Fondell J.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1130-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The pGL3-Aurora-A promoter luciferase reporter genes containing –370 or –90 to +354 regions of the human Aurora-A gene promoter (28Tanaka M. Ueda A. Kanamori H. Ideguchi H. Yang J. Kitajima S.

The GABP binding site (CTTCCGG at –85 to –79) in the pGL-370 Aurora-A promoter construct was mutated to CTTGGAA using a PCR approach as previously described (30Ko J.K. Ma J. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: C1273-C1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) thus generating pGL-370-Mut. The pGL3-basic plasmid is from Promega. GST fusion bacterial expression constructs pGEX-GABPα and pGEX-GABPβ1 were kindly provided by Dr. H. Handa (Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo). Cell Culture, Transient Transfections, and Luciferase Assays—HeLa cells were routinely maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 20 mm HEPES (all media and supplements were from Invitrogen). Transient transfections were performed using Lipofectamine in combination with the Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In experiments involving T3-dependent transcription, the transfected cells were subsequently cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% charcoal/dextran-stripped fetal bovine serum (HyClone) for 24 h in the presence or absence of T3 (10–7 m final). Cells were harvested and luciferase activity was determined using the Dual Luciferase Assay System (Promega). Luciferase values were normalized using an internal control Renilla luciferase expression vector (pRL-TK) (Promega). TRAP220/MED1 RNAi—Small interfering RNA (siRNA) specific for TRAP220/MED1 was purchased from Dharmacon Research. The 21-nucleotide MED1 siRNA is specific for the 3′-untranslated region of the native MED1 mRNA (NCBI accession number NM_004774). A nonspecific (scrambled) siRNA (Dharmacon) was used as a control. HeLa cells were transfected with MED1 siRNA or control siRNA at a final concentration of 100 nm using Lipofectamine in combination with Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and as described in detail previously (19Pandey P.K. Udayakumar T.S. Lin X. Sharma D. Shapiro P.S. Fondell J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 10695-10710Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemistry—HeLa cells were seeded on coverslips in 12-well plates (105 cells/well) and either synchronized or transfected with siRNA. Following fixation in 4% formaldehyde/PBS, the cells were permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS, washed in PBS, and subsequently blocked in PBS, 5% goat serum. Primary antibodies were applied to the coverslips for 1 h and then overlaid with Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Molecular Probes) for 30 min in 5% goat serum. Following 3 washes in PBS, the coverslips were further incubated in 4′, 6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole (1 μg/ml) to stain the nuclei. The coverslips were then mounted using an aqueous mounting medium (Anti-fading Agents; Biomeda Corp.). The images were examined and captured using a Nikon E1000 microscope and analyzed using IMAGEPRO software. RNA Isolation and Microarray Analyses—HeLa cells were transfected with either TRAP220/MED1 siRNA or control siRNA (100 nm final) for 72 h. 20 μg of total RNA was extracted from each sample using RNeasy (Qiagen) and submitted for microarray analysis at the Core Expression Array Facility (Cancer Institute of New Jersey) using high-density oligonucleotide HG-U133A arrays (Affymetrix). Three independent experiments were performed. Probe level analysis and normalization (using global scaling) were performed using Microarray Analysis Suite version 5.1 (Affymetrix) and Array Tools (developed by Dr. Richard Simon, NCI-Frederick, National Institutes of Health, Fredrick, MD). A class comparison algorithm in Array Tools was used to conduct an univariate t test followed by an exact multivariate permutation test (with 1000 permutation) to identify genes showing significant expression value changes between MED1 siRNA samples and control siRNA samples. The cut-off criteria were genes with a permutation p ≤ 0.001. ChIP—ChIP assays were performed essentially as previously described in detail (31Sharma D. Fondell J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7934-7939Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) using antibodies against MED1/TRAP220, MED6, or GABPα. The primers for the Aurora-A promoter were: F1, 5′-GGTGCTTCACCGATAAATGGCCG-3′ (–169), and R1, 5′-TCAGCCGTTAGAATTCAAAGGTTC-3′ (+98); F2, 5′-GCGCGAATCCTGCCCAATCTAC-3′ (–366) and R2, 5′-CGGCCATTTATCGGTGAAGCAAC-3′ (–145). The primers for the human ISG54 gene promoter were: forward 5′-GAGGAAAAAGAGTCCTCTA-3′ and reverse 5′-AGCTGCACTCTTCAGAAAT-3′. In experiments involving the ISG54 promoter, HeLa cells were pre-treated with 1000 units/ml α interferon (ENDOGEN Pharmaceuticals) for 1 h prior to formaldehyde treatment. All ChIP experiments were carried out at least three times. Image processing of the data were performed using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). RT-PCR—HeLa cells (1 × 106) were transfected with either TRAP220/MED1 siRNA or control siRNA (100 nm final). The TRAP220/MED1 expression vector pSG5-HA-TRAP220 (4 μg) was cotransfected as indicated. 72 h post-transfection, total RNA was extracted from the cells using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). First strand cDNA synthesis was generated by incubating 1μg of total RNA with 200 mm dNTPs (final concentration), 1× reverse transcriptase buffer, and 1 unit of reverse transcriptase (New England Biolabs) in a total volume of 10 μl at 42 °C for 90 min. First strand cDNA was PCR amplified using Taq DNA polymerase (Takara) together with specific primers for either human Aurora-A (forward, 5′-AATTGCAGATTTTGGGTGGTCAG-3′ and reverse, 5′-AAACTTCAGTAGCATGTTCCTGCT-3′) or β-actin (forward, 5′-GCTCCTCCTGAGCGCAAG-3′ and reverse, 5′-CATCTGCTGGAAGGTGGACA-3′) for 25 cycles. The PCR product was analyzed on a 1.5% EtBr-stained agarose gel. To verify that the PCR products were in the linear range of amplification, preliminary experiments were performed varying either the concentration of total RNA or total number of PCR cycles. GST Pulldown Assay—The pGEX-GABPα and pGEX-GABPβ1 constructs, as well as a pGEX-2TK control vector (Amersham Biosciences), were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) pLysS. The GST and GST fusion proteins were then purified as described (13Ren Y. Behre E. Ren Z. Zhang J. Wang Q. Fondell J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5433-5446Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Purification of baculovirus HA-TRAP220/MED1 from insect Sf9 cells was carried out exactly as previously described (32Wang Q. Sharma D. Ren Y. Fondell J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42852-42858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In 250 μl of BC100/Nonidet P-40 (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% powdered milk), 0.5 μg of GST-GABPα, GST-GABPβ1, or GST alone, was added together with 40 ng of baculovirally expressed HA-TRAP220/MED1 and then mixed for 1 h at 4°C on a rotator. Protein complexes were precipitated by gentle centrifugation and washed three times in BC100/Nonidet P-40 followed by resuspension in SDS sample loading buffer. Following 8% SDS-PAGE fractionation, the bound proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and probed by Western blot with anti-TRAP220/MED1 antibodies. Coimmunoprecipitation—HeLa cells were grown in 15-cm plates and transfected with either TRAP220/MED1 siRNA or control siRNA (100 nm final). 72 h post-transfection, the cells (5 × 107) were harvested for nuclear extract preparation essentially as described (33Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499-2505Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were collected for harvesting by gentle scraping in 1 ml of ice-cold PBS and pelleting by centrifugation at 1200 × g at 4 °C. The PBS was aspirated and the cell pellet was washed once in PBS followed by resuspension in 1 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40). Nuclei were gently isolated by centrifugation at 4000 × g and resuspended in 200 μl of extraction buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.9, 0.42 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The resulting nuclear extracts were incubated on ice for 10 min and cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g. Protein concentration of nuclear extracts was determined by the Bradford assay. For coimmunoprecipitation of GABPα-associated proteins, 2 mg of nuclear extract was incubated with 2 μg of goat anti-GABPα antibodies together with 20 μl of protein G-agarose beads (packed volume) (Roche Applied Science), and the mixture rotated slowly at 4 °C for 6–8 h. The beads were collected by gentle centrifugation and washed twice with 1.5 ml of ice-cold buffer A (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). After the final wash, the precipitated complexes were resuspended in SDS sample loading buffer, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and probed first with anti-TRAP220/MED1 and subsequently with anti-β-tubulin antibodies. TRAP220/MED1 Knockdown by RNAi—To better understand the role of TRAP220/MED1 as a signaling mediator of cellular growth, we utilized RNAi to knockdown TRAP220/MED1 expression in human HeLa cells. In these experiments, siRNA duplexes were generated against the 3′-untranslated region of the native TRAP220/MED1 mRNA (see “Experimental Procedures”). To ascertain the efficacy of RNAi as a means of inhibiting TRAP220/MED1 protein expression, HeLa cells were transfected with TRAP220/MED1-specific siRNA and then subjected to immunocytochemical staining and immunoblotting with anti-MED1 antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1A, transfection with TRAP220/MED1 siRNA significantly depleted the amount of TRAP220/MED1 in HeLa cell nuclei, whereas transfection with a scrambled siRNA control had no effect. Similarly, immunoblot analyses of HeLa cells transfected with TRAP220/MED1 siRNA revealed a significant (>90%) reduction in TRAP220/MED1 protein expression (Fig. 1B). By contrast, the expression levels of other TRAP/Mediator subunits (TRAP80/MED17 and TRAP100/MED24), the general transcription factor TFIIB, and largest subunit of RNA polymerase II were all unaffected by TRAP220/MED1 siRNA (Fig. 1B). Loss of TRAP220/MED1 Expression Impairs Thyroid Hormone Signaling—One well established functional role for human TRAP220/MED1 is as a coactivator for NRs (8Ito M. Roeder R.G. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 12: 127-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 13Ren Y. Behre E. Ren Z. Zhang J. Wang Q. Fondell J.D. Mol. Cell.

To verify that loss of endogenous TRAP220/MED1 expression impairs NR signaling, HeLa cells were transfected with TRAP220/MED1 siRNA together with a thyroid hormone receptor α (TRα) expression vector and a thyroid hormone (T3)-responsive reporter gene. The cells were then cultured in the presence or absence of T3 and transcription from the reporter gene was measured (Fig. 2). Robust T3-dependent transcription (8–10-fold) was observed in the presence of control siRNA, but as expected, the T3 response was significantly impaired in the presence of TRAP220/MED1 siRNA. Because the TRAP220/MED1 siRNA is specific for the 3′-untranslated region of native TRAP220/MED1 mRNA, we asked whether ectopic TRAP220/MED1 expression (lacking the 3′-untranslated region) could restore the T3 response. Indeed, transient transfection of a recombinant TRAP220/MED1 expression vector restored T3-dependent transactivation to near normal levels (Fig. 2). In summary, these data show that RNAi is an effective strategy for inhibiting TRAP220/MED1 expression in cultured human cells and that loss of TRAP220/MED1 expression disrupts physiologically important cellular signaling pathways. TRAP220/MED1 Depletion Triggers Down-regulation of Aurora-A Gene Expression—Given the essential role of TRAP220/MED1 in cellular growth and animal development (17Zhu Y. Qi C. Jia Y. Nye J.S. Rao M.S.

In particular, we were interested in identifying genes that are downregulated following TRAP220/MED1 depletion, possibly revealing a coactivator role for TRAP220/MED1 in regulating their expression. Toward this end, mRNA was isolated from HeLa cells transfected with TRAP220/MED1 siRNA or the scrambled control and subsequently analyzed using cDNA microarrays representing over 22,000 human genes (U133A, Affymetrix). We selectively identified genes that showed consistent down-regulation following TRAP220/MED1 depletion in three independent experiments. Approximately 150 genes were identified that had a permutation p value less than 0.001 (see “Experimental Procedures”). Interestingly, and consistent with the embryonic growth arrest observed Trap220/Med1–/– knockout mice, greater than 10% of the identified genes are involved in cell growth and cell cycle regulation. A representative subset of the genes is shown in Table 1 and includes the human Aurora-A serine/threonine kinase.TABLE 1Cell growth related genes that are down-regulated in TRAP220/MED1-depleted HeLa cellsGene nameProposed functionAccession no.-Fold decreaseaGeometric mean-fold decrease in expression value changes between TRAP220/MED1 siRNA-treated samples and control siRNA samples from three independent experiments.p valuebA class comparison algorithm was used to conduct an univariate t test followed by an exact multivariate permutation test with a permutation of 1000 (see “Experimental Procedures”).

https://openalex.org/W1991939194,"Ethanol exposure inhibits protein synthesis and causes cell death in the developing central nervous system. The double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-activated protein kinase (PKR), a serine/threonine protein kinase, plays an important role in translational regulation and cell survival. PKR has been well known for its anti-viral response. Upon activation by viral infection or dsRNA, PKR phosphorylates its substrate, theα-subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor-2 (eIF2α) leading to inhibition of translation initiation. It has recently been shown that, in the absence of a virus or dsRNA, PKR can be activated by direct interactions with its protein activators, PACT, or its mouse homologue, RAX. We have demonstrated that exposure to ethanol increased the phosphorylation of PKR and eIF2α in the developing cerebellum. The effect of ethanol on PKR/eIF2α phosphorylation positively correlated to the expression of PACT/RAX in cultured neuronal cells. Using PKR inhibitors and PKR null mouse fibroblasts, we verified that ethanol-induced eIF2α phosphorylation was mediated by PKR. Overexpression of a wild-type RAX dramatically enhanced sensitivity to ethanol-induced PKR/eIF2α phosphorylation, as well as translational inhibition and cell death. In contrast, overexpression of a mutant (S18A) RAX inhibited ethanol-mediated PKR/eIF2α activation. Ethanol promoted PKR and RAX association in cells expressing wild-type RAX but not in cells expressing S18A RAX. S18A RAX functioned as a dominant negative protein and blocked ethanol-induced inhibition of protein synthesis and cell death. Our results suggest that the interactions between PKR and PACT/RAX modulate the effect of ethanol on protein synthesis and cell survival in the central nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2074401103,"N-WASP is a member of the WASP family of proteins, which play essential roles in actin dynamics during cell adhesion and migration. hnRNPK is a member of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein complex, which has also been implicated in the regulation of cell spreading. Here, we identify a direct interaction between N-WASP and hnRNPK. We show that this interaction is mediated by the N-terminal WH1 domain of N-WASP and the segment of hnRNPK containing its K interaction (KI) domain. Furthermore, these two proteins are co-localized at the cell periphery in the spreading initiation center during the early stage of cell spreading. We found that co-expression of hnRNPK with N-WASP reverses the stimulation of cell spreading by N-WASP, and this effect is correlated with hnRNPK binding to N-WASP. Expression of hnRNPK does not affect subcellular localization of N-WASP protein. However, co-expression of hnRNPK with N-WASP reduced filopodia formation stimulated by N-WASP in spreading cells. Together, these results identify hnRNPK as a new negative regulator of N-WASP and suggest that hnRNPK may regulate the initial stage of cell spreading by direct association with N-WASP in the spreading initiation center."
https://openalex.org/W2001740185,"Peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) has been shown to suppress cell proliferation and tumorigenesis, whereas the gastrointestinal regulatory peptide gastrin stimulates the growth of neoplastic cells. The present studies were directed to determine whether changes in PPARγ expression might mediate the effects of gastrin on the proliferation of colorectal cancer (CRC). Initially, using growth assays, we determined that the human CRC cell line DLD-1 expressed both functional PPARγ and gastrin receptors. Amidated gastrin (G-17) attenuated the growth suppressing effects of PPARγ by decreasing PPARγ activity and total protein expression, in part through an increase in the rate of proteasomal degradation. G-17-induced degradation of PPARγ appeared to be mediated through phosphorylation of PPARγ at serine 84 by a process involving the biphasic phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). These results were confirmed through the use of EGFR antagonist AG1478 and MEK1 inhibitor PD98059. Furthermore, mutation of PPARγ at serine 84 reduced the effects of G-17, as evident by inability of G-17 to attenuate PPARγ promoter activity, degrade PPARγ, or inhibit the growth suppressing effects of PPARγ. The results of these studies demonstrate that the trophic properties of gastrin in CRC may be mediated in part by transactivation of the EGFR and phosphorylation of ERK1/2, leading to degradation of PPARγ protein and a decrease in PPARγ activation."
https://openalex.org/W1975168536,"CUTL1, also known as CDP (CCAAT Displacement Protein), Cut, or Cux-1, is a homeodomain transcription factor known to play an essential role in development and cell cycle progression. Previously, we identified CUTL1 as modulator of cell motility and invasiveness. Here we report that protein kinase A (PKA), known to inhibit tumor progression in various tumor types, directly phosphorylates CUTL1 at serine 1215 in NIH3T3 fibroblasts. The PKA-induced phosphorylation results in decreased DNA binding affinity of CUTL1 and diminished CUTL1-mediated cell cycle progression and cell motility.

PKA consists of two separate subunits, the catalytic (C) and regulatory (R) subunits that interact to form an inactive holoenzyme complex (2Taylor S.S. Buechler J.A. Yonemoto W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 971-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar). Activation of PKA is achieved by binding of the second messenger cAMP to the R subunit, which consequently induces a conformational change in the R subunit and leads to the dissociation of the holoenzyme into its constituent subunits (1Mei F.C.

However, these effects appear to be dependent on the cellular context (3Schmitt J.M. Stork P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3671-3683Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). cAMP is known to have anti-proliferative effects by antagonizing ERK activation via PKA in a variety of cell systems including fibroblasts, glial cells, and lymphocytes (4Schmitt J.M.

Studies in flies indicate that the Drosophila homologue of CUTL1, Cut, is a major determinant of cell type specification downstream of the notch pathway (23Tavares A.T. Tsukui T.

Although initial data based on loss of heterozygosity studies suggested CUTL1 as a candidate tumor suppressor gene (25Zeng W.R. Watson P. Lin J. Jothy S. Lidereau R. Park M. Nepveu A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2015-2021Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), a recent report suggests instead that CUTL1 could play a role in promoting breast cancer: Goulet et al. (26Goulet B.

In addition, we have demonstrated that CUTL1 strongly promotes cell motility and invasiveness in vitro and in vivo in a variety of cell systems and that CUTL1 expression is associated with a less differentiated phenotype and worsened prognosis in breast cancer (27Michl P.

Based on our previous data, we sought to investigate whether the transcriptional activity of CUTL1 is modulated by upstream signaling pathways implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation and motility. We could demonstrate that CUTL1 is phosphorylated by protein kinase A, leading to a decrease in DNA binding affinity and transcriptional activity. Furthermore, we were able to show that CUTL1 phosphorylation by PKA affected expression of several of its downstream target genes and inhibited CUTL1-mediated proliferation and migration.

Flow Cytometry—Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis was performed as described previously (29Michl P. Barth C. Buchholz M. Lerch M.M. Rolke M. Holzmann K.H. Menke A. Fensterer H. Giehl K. Lohr M. Leder G. Iwamura T. Adler G. Gress T.M. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 6265-6271PubMed Google Scholar). Reverse Transcription PCR—Reverse transcription was performed using the Superscript first strand synthesis kit (Invitrogen). PCR was performed for 30 cycles. Primer sequences are available on request. Quantitative real-time PCR analyses using the comparative CT method were performed on an ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detector system using the SYBR Green PCR Master Mix kit (PerkinElmer, Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturers' instructions. Following initial incubation at 50 °C for 2 and 10 min at 95 °C, amplification was performed for 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. Specific primer pairs were determined with the PrimerExpress® program (Applied Biosystems). The murine cyclophilin A gene was used as the internal standard. Primer sequences are available on request. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—5 × 105 cells were lysed in Hepes buffer containing 1% Triton-X100, sonicated, and immunoprecipitated with mouse monoclonal anti-Myc antibody (clone 9E10; Abcam, Cambridge, MA) or with an antibody directed against phosphorylated PKA substrates (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). The immunoprecipitates were size fractionated by SDS-PAGE on precast gels (NuPAGE; Invitrogen) and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Watford, UK). The following antibodies were used for immunodetection: our own rabbit anti-CUTL1 (antigen, GST-hCUTL1-(2551-3451) (27Michl P. Ramjaun A.R. Pardo O.E. Warne P.H. Wagner M. Poulsom R. D'Arrigo C. Ryder K. Menke A. Gress T. Downward J. Cancer Cell. 2005; 7: 521-532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and anti-phospho-CUTL1 peptide antibody (antigen, peptide containing CUTL1 amino acids 1209-1222 including phosphorylated serine at position 1215), goat anti-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-phospho-PKA substrate antibody, anti-phospho-PKB substrate antibody (anti-pSer/Thr), p42/44 MAPK (ERK) antibody and phospho-p42/44 MAPK (ERK) antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), mouse anti-Myc clone 9E10 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA). Following peroxidase-coupled secondary antiserum (Amersham Biosciences), blots were detected by ECL chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Luciferase Reporter Assays—Cells were transiently transfected using GeneJuice (Merck Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions and harvested 24 h after transfection. Because the internal control plasmid is itself often repressed by CDP/Cux, as a control for transfection efficiency the purified β-galactosidase protein (Sigma) was included in the transfection mix as previously described (14Truscott M. Raynal L. Premdas P. Goulet B. Leduy L. Berube G. Nepveu A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3013-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 30Howcroft T.K. Kirshner S.L. Singer D.S. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 244: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The luciferase assays were performed using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. β-galactosidase activity was detected using 2-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside (ONPG; Sigma) in substrate buffer (1 mm MgCl2, 1 mg/ml ONPG, 75 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 60 mm β-mercaptoethanol) at 420 nm. Wound Healing Assays—An artificial “wound” was created using a 10-μl pipette tip on confluent cell monolayers in 6-well culture plates. Photographs were taken at 0 and 8 h. Quantitative analysis of the wound closure was calculated by counting the number of cells/105 μm2 wound area at 8 h. Two-chamber Migration Assays—Cell migration was determined by using the modified two-chamber migration assay (8-μm pore size; BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 2.5 × 104 cells were seeded in serum-free medium into the upper chamber and migrated toward 10% fetal calf serum as a chemoattractant in the lower chamber for 18 h. Cells in the upper chamber were carefully removed using cotton buds, and cells at the bottom of the membrane were fixed and stained with crystal violet 0.2%/methanol 20%. Quantification was performed by counting the stained cells. Video Time-lapse Microscopy—Time-lapse imaging of migrating cells was performed on an inverted Zeiss Axiovert 135TV microscope (X-Y-Z motorized stage/piezo Z control; Zeiss, Jena, Germany) over 24 h at 37 °C/10% CO2. Images were obtained with a Hamamatsu Orca ER firewire CCD camera every 7 or 20 min and analyzed using image analysis software (AQM Advance6 and Tracker; Kinetic Imaging Ltd, Bromborough, UK). Migration of each cell was analyzed by measuring the distance traveled by a cell nucleus over the 24-h time period. Statistical analysis was performed using the Mathematica 4.2 software (Wolfram Research, Long Hanborough, UK). The average migration speed in μm/min was calculated by analyzing at least 24 cells/group. Electromobility Shift Assays—Gel shift assays were performed as described previously (31Ellenrieder V. Zhang J.S. Kaczynski J. Urrutia R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2451-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The consensus and mutant CDP binding oligonucleotides were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. 4 μg of nuclear extract from cells transiently transfected with CUTL1-(831-1336) WT or S1215A mutant were incubated in binding buffer (125 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 25 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 6 μg/ml of bovine serum albumin, 5 μg/ml of poly(dI-dC)). For supershift assays, 6 μg of rabbit anti-CUTL1/CDP antibody (Santa Cruz supershift reagent) was included. The end-labeled probe was then added to each reaction and subsequently loaded onto a 4% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Dried gels were scanned in a PhosphorImager (Storm 860; Amersham Biosciences). CUTL1 Is Phosphorylated by PKA—By screening CUTL1 for putative phosphorylation sites using Scansite (scansite.mit.edu), we found several putative phosphorylation sites for PKA and protein kinase B, also known as Akt. One of these sites (MKRRHSSVS at position 1210-1218) is evolutionarily conserved across species and was predicted to be a target site for PKA (phosphorylation of serine 1215) and for protein kinase B (phosphorylation of serine 1216). Initially, we wanted to test whether CUTL1 is phosphorylated by protein kinase B at serine 1216. Therefore, we used an antibody that was designed to recognize phosphorylated serine/threonine motifs of protein kinase B substrates. We and others have found, however, that this antibody has broader specificity for several phospho-serine/threonine motifs containing upstream basic residues (32Zhang H. Zha X. Tan Y. Hornbeck P.V. Mastrangelo A.J. Alessi D.R. Polakiewicz R.D. Comb M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39379-39387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). We found that the antibody recognized CUTL1 phosphorylation induced by dibutyryl-cAMP or forskolin as PKA stimulators (Fig. 1a). Activation of PKB did not result in CUTL1 phosphorylation (data not shown). Stimulation with cAMP induced a rapid phosphorylation of CUTL1, detectable by Western blot after 15 min with a peak at 45 min (Fig. 1b). Because PKA-independent effects of cAMP and forskolin have been described (1Mei F.C. Qiao J. Tsygankova O.M. Meinkoth J.L. Quilliam L.A. Cheng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11497-11504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), we aimed to examine direct involvement of PKA in the cAMP/forskolin-induced phosphorylation. As a first step, we used the pharmacological PKA inhibitor H89. Coincubation with H89 decreased the cAMP-induced phosphorylation markedly (Fig. 2a). In addition, cotransfection with dominant negative PKA or with the inhibitory peptide PKI (28Edin M.L. Howe A.K. Juliano R.L. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 270: 214-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) inhibited cAMP-induced phosphorylation (Fig. 2b), indicating that the CUTL1 phosphorylation is mediated by PKA and is not a PKA-independent phosphorylation event induced by cAMP and forskolin. Immunoprecipitation with an antibody designed to detect phosphorylated PKA substrates revealed a detectable CUTL1 immunoblot signal upon cAMP stimulation (Fig. 2c), showing that the endogenous CUTL1 protein is phosphorylated following activation of PKA. To further rule out possible involvement of other serine/threonine kinases that might be able to phosphorylate similar motifs, we used several drugs such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor UO126 acting upstream of p90RSK, the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin acting upstream of p70S6K, and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002. None of these inhibitors was able to decrease cAMP-induced CUTL1 phosphorylation to a significant extent, indicating that involvement of the serine/threonine kinases p90RSK and p70S6K is unlikely and that protein kinases controlled by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase are also not involved (Fig. 2d). PKA Phosphorylates CUTL1 at Ser-1215—To investigate which residue serves as the actual phosphorylation site for PKA, we generated serine to alanine mutants by site-directed mutagenesis at codons 1215 and 1216 as well as threonine to alanine mutants at codons 45 and 1454, which were also predicted as putative PKA sites by Scansite. Using these constructs, we determined that cAMP stimulation is unable to induce any detectable phosphorylation of the S1215A mutant (Fig. 3a). To further confirm the PKA-mediated phosphorylation of CUTL1 at Ser-1215, we generated a phospho-specific peptide antibody against the motif around the phosphorylated Ser-1215. Using this antibody, we saw cAMP-inducible phosphorylation that was only detectable in WT CUTL1 but was absent in CUTL1 S1215A (Fig. 3b). This antibody detected cAMP-induced phosphorylation both in Western blots using immunoprecipitated Myc-tagged CUTL1 and in cAMP-stimulated whole-cell lysates with endogenous CUTL1, as demonstrated in Fig. 3c. PKA Decreases CUTL1-mediated Proliferation and Migration—To study the transcriptional effects of CUTL1, we have previously suppressed CUTL1 expression by vector-based transfection of specific shRNA in NIH3T3 fibroblasts, which express high endogenous CUTL1 levels. Stable CUTL1 RNAi clones that showed no detectable CUTL1 expression by Western blot were used for further studies in comparison with empty vector-transfected control clones (27Michl P. Ramjaun A.R. Pardo O.E. Warne P.H. Wagner M. Poulsom R. D'Arrigo C. Ryder K. Menke A. Gress T. Downward J. Cancer Cell. 2005; 7: 521-532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Using this cell system as well as other cell lines, we previously showed that CUTL1 expression is strongly associated with increased cell migration and invasiveness in vitro and in vivo (27Michl P. Ramjaun A.R. Pardo O.E. Warne P.H. Wagner M. Poulsom R. D'Arrigo C. Ryder K. Menke A. Gress T. Downward J. Cancer Cell. 2005; 7: 521-532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Furthermore, CUTL1 has been shown to enhance proliferation by stimulating S-phase progression in a variety of cell lines (13Coqueret O. Berube G. Nepveu A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4680-4694Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). To test the biological significance of the CUTL1 modulation by PKA, we first examined the effect of CUTL1 on proliferation in the presence or absence of PKA activation. Suppression of CUTL1 by shRNA significantly reduced proliferation as measured by cell counting (Fig. 4a), 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays, and bromodeoxyuridine enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (data not shown). cAMP significantly decreased proliferation in the presence of endogenous CUTL1. However, it did not further affect the reduced proliferation in the absence of CUTL1 (Fig. 4a). The CUTL1 shRNA-mediated decrease in proliferation was paralleled by a decrease in S-phase progression as demonstrated by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis (Fig. 4b). cAMP reduced S-phase progression in wild-type cells to a significant extent but had only minor effects on S-phase progression in the absence of CUTL1. Based on these data, PKA appears likely to exert at least a significant part of its anti-proliferative effects through CUTL1. Besides its effect on CUTL1 phosphorylation, PKA is known to decrease ERK activity in several cell systems. In the NIH3T3 cells used, PKA activation reduced basal ERK activity (Fig. 4c). However, ERK activation by epidermal growth factor (EGF) did not affect cAMP-induced phosphorylation of CUTL1 at Ser-1215 as detected by the phospho-specific CUTL1 antibody (Fig. 4d). This suggests that activation of ERK does not affect the transcriptional activity of CUTL1 by decreasing PKA-induced phosphorylation of CUTL1 at Ser-1215. Given our previous results on CUTL1 as an enhancer of cell migration (27Michl P. Ramjaun A.R. Pardo O.E. Warne P.H. Wagner M. Poulsom R. D'Arrigo C. Ryder K. Menke A. Gress T. Downward J. Cancer Cell. 2005; 7: 521-532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), we examined as a next step the effect of PKA activation on CUTL1-induced cell migration. For that purpose, we employed three different assays examining different aspects of cell motility: modified Boyden chamber assays, wound healing assays, and time-lapse video microscopy, which measures cell migration independent of a proliferation bias. As demonstrated above for proliferation, addition of cAMP significantly decreased the migration of NIH3T3 control cells. In contrast, the effect of cAMP on the migration of CUTL1 RNAi cells was markedly less pronounced. These results were obtained by two-chamber migration assays with a chemotactic gradient from serum-free to serum-containing medium (mean migrated cells/field ± S.E.: control + cAMP: 52 ± 7 cells, control: 75 ± 9 cells, CUTL1 RNAi + cAMP: 23 ± 5 cells, CUTL1 RNAi: 25 ± 5 cells) (Fig. 5a), by time-lapse microscopy (Fig. 5b) and by wound healing assays (Fig. 5c) and were also confirmed in HT1080 cells (data not shown). These data suggest that PKA mediates its anti-migratory effects to a significant extent through CUTL1. PKA Decreases CUTL1 Transcriptional Activity—To investigate the effect of PKA on CUTL1 transcriptional activity at a single-gene level, we examined the transcriptional regulation of the known CUTL1 target gene DNA polymerase A (14Truscott M. Raynal L. Premdas P. Goulet B. Leduy L. Berube G. Nepveu A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3013-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and several other CUTL1 target genes, which we previously identified by microarray experiments (27Michl P. Ramjaun A.R. Pardo O.E. Warne P.H. Wagner M. Poulsom R. D'Arrigo C. Ryder K. Menke A. Gress T. Downward J. Cancer Cell. 2005; 7: 521-532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), in the presence or absence of PKA stimulation. To enhance the transcriptional activation of CUTL1, we used the C-terminal fragment of CUTL1, amino acids 831–1336, which mimics the product of cleavage of full-length CUTL1 by cathepsin L, which has enhanced transcriptional activity (33Goulet B. Baruch A. Moon N.S. Poirier M. Sansregret L.L. Erickson A. Bogyo M. Nepveu A. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 207-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). By reporter assay, we could confirm the negative effect of PKA on overexpressed CUTL1 activity at the promoter level for the CUTL1 target DNA polymerase A, which is known to be involved in DNA synthesis and S-phase progression (Fig. 6a). In addition, we examined by real-time PCR the expression levels of several endogenous CUTL1 target genes previously identified by microarray experiments, such as DKK2, DAB2, and DPYSL3 (27Michl P. Ramjaun A.R. Pardo O.E. Warne P.H. Wagner M. Poulsom R. D'Arrigo C. Ryder K. Menke A. Gress T. Downward J. Cancer Cell. 2005; 7: 521-532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), with or without PKA activation. The majority of the genes tested showed a marked decrease of the CUTL1-induced up-regulation by PKA. In the absence of CUTL1 the effect of PKA was much less pronounced (Fig. 6b). To examine PKA-dependent alterations in the affinity of CUTL1 for its DNA binding site, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assay studies in the presence or absence of PKA activity by analyzing overexpressed CUTL1 WT or the non-phosphorylatable S1215A mutant with or without PKA inhibitor H89. CUTL1 binding activity increased markedly upon PKA inhibition in CUTL1 WT nuclear extracts. In CUTL1 S1215A nuclear extracts, the basal binding activity was increased as compared with WT extracts, and addition of H89 was not able to further increase the binding affinity, indicating that PKA decreases CUTL1 binding activity via phosphorylation at Ser-1215 (Fig. 6c). To assess the PKA-dependent effect of the S1215A mutant on migration, we performed time-lapse migration experiments with transiently transfected CUTL1 WT or S1215A mutants in NIH3T3 cells. PKA activation decreased cell migration only in cells transfected with CUTL1 WT, but not in cells transfected with CUTL1 S1215A (Fig. 6d). This further confirms that PKA inhibits CUTL1 transcriptional activity by phosphorylation of Ser-1215, with subsequent effects on cell motility. In addition to the phosphorylation at Ser-1215 by PKA, previous reports described the adjacent residues Ser-1237 and Ser-1270 as targets for cyclin A/cdk1 (22Santaguida M. Ding Q. Berube G. Truscott M. Whyte P. Nepveu A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45780-45790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), phosphorylation of which caused inhibition of DNA binding. Therefore, we were interested whether phosphorylation of the adjacent serines 1237 and 1270 modulates PKA action. Using luciferase assays for the CUTL1 target DNA polymerase A, we found that double mutants S1237D/S1270D mimicking phosphorylations at these residues led to reduced transcriptional activity of CUTL1, as expected. PKA activation by forskolin reduced the transcriptional activity of S1237D/S1270D CUTL1 still significantly, reaching levels similar to wild-type CUTL1. This suggests that phosphorylation events in the region between residue 1215 and 1270 induced by PKA or cyclin A/cdk1 have similar effects on the transcriptional activity of CUTL1. They might be induced by PKA and/or cyclin A/cdk1, depending on the cellular context. Phosphorylation at Ser-1237/Ser-1270, however, does not abrogate the ability of PKA to phosphorylate CUTL1 at Ser-1215. In this study, we have demonstrated that the homeodomain transcription factor CUTL1 is phosphorylated at serine 1215 by protein kinase A. This phosphorylation results in reduced DNA binding affinity and decreased CUTL1-mediated proliferation and migration, which was paralleled by a reduced transcription of CUTL1 target genes. Several other protein kinases have been shown to modulate CUTL1 transcriptional activity by phosphorylation at distinct residues. Based on the observation that Cut-specific DNA binding was increased following phosphatase treatment, Coqueret et al. (21Coqueret O. Berube G. Nepveu A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24862-24868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) found that PKC efficiently phosphorylated Cut repeats 1–3 at residues Thr-415, Thr-804, and Ser-987, which inhibited DNA binding. In addition, cyclin A/cdk1 was shown to bind to CUTL1 and modulate its DNA binding activity in vitro and in vivo (22Santaguida M. Ding Q. Berube G. Truscott M. Whyte P. Nepveu A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45780-45790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar): phosphorylation of serines 1237 and 1270 caused inhibition of DNA binding. In cotransfection studies, cyclin A/cdk1 inhibited CUTL1 stable DNA binding and prevented repression of the p21WAF1 reporter. In contrast, mutant CUTL1 proteins in which serines 1237 and 1270 were replaced with alanines were not affected by cyclin A/cdk1. The fact that serine 1215, the target residue for PKA identified in this report, and serines 1237 and 1270, the target residues for cyclin A-ckd1, are in close proximity suggests that phosphorylations in this region induce conformational changes that lead to reduced transcriptional activity. All three residues are located between the conserved C-terminal cut repeat 3 and the homeodomain, both of which have recently been reported as the major determinants of CUTL1 activity after proteolytic cleavage of the N-terminal region (34Goulet B. Nepveu A. Cell Cycle. 2004; 3Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Despite similar effects on the transcriptional activity of CUTL1 induced by phosphorylations at both Ser-1237/Ser-1270 and Ser-1215, our data indicate that the phosphorylation at Ser-1237/Ser-70 by cyclin A/cdk1 does not abrogate the effect of PKA on Ser-1215, underlining the importance of the phosphorylation event induced by PKA. Protein kinase A is known to play an important role in tumorigenesis and cancer progression. However, its effect on tumor cell proliferation and migration is dependent on the cellular context. Although in certain cell systems PKA activity induced by cAMP is able to stimulate cell growth by enhancing ERK activity, in many other cell types, including the cells used here, cAMP inhibits ERK activity (4Schmitt J.M. Stork P.J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 85-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 36Wang L. Liu F. Adamo M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37242-37249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and inhibits cell proliferation. A number of mechanisms for the growth-inhibitory effect of cAMP have been proposed, only some of which involve cross-talk with the ERK pathway. First, PKA blocks Raf-1 activation by direct serine phosphorylation (37Wu J. Dent P. Jelinek T. Wolfman A. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. Science. 1993; 262: 1065-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar, 38Cook S.J. McCormick F. Science. 1993; 262: 1069-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar, 39Burgering B.M.

Second, PKA may activate the Rap1 GTPase via Src, thereby inhibiting ERK in some cell contexts (4Schmitt J.M. Stork P.J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 85-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Third, PKA may inhibit Akt activity and thereby activate the FoxO4 transcription factor and induce the CDK inhibitor p27Kip1 (42Kuiperij H.B. van der Horst A. Raaijmakers J. Weijzen S. Medema R.H. Bos J.L. Burgering B.M. Zwartkruis F.J. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2087-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Based on our data, we propose that in addition, PKA activity decreases proliferation and cell motility, and possibly tumor progression, at least in part by phosphorylating CUTL1 and thereby inhibiting its transcriptional activity. Detailed study of cAMP effects on carcinoma cell motility by Mercurio and co-workers (43O'Connor K.L. Shaw L.M. Mercurio A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1749-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and others has shown that α6β4 integrin-mediated invasion required suppression of cAMP levels by activation of a phosphodiesterase. This was required for RhoA translocation from the cytosol to membrane ruffles (44O'Connor K.L. Nguyen B.K. Mercurio A.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Elevated cAMP levels have also been reported to block RhoA activation (45Laudanna C. Campbell J.J. Butcher E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24141-24144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 46Dong J.M. Leung T. Manser E. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22554-22562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Although it has been suggested that these effects are due, at least in lymphocytes, to direct phosphorylation of RhoA by PKA at Ser-188 (47Lang P. Gesbert F. Delespine-Carmagnat M. Stancou R. Pouchelet M. Bertoglio J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 510-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar), our data suggest that control of the transcriptional activity of CUTL1 following phosphorylation by PKA could be of major significance in controlling cell motility. It is possible that inhibitory effects of PKA on the ERK MAP kinase pathway might also contribute to the reduction in cell migration seen in cells treated with cAMP, possibly in a synergistic manner to the CUTL1 pathway. However, we found that ERK activation induced by EGF did not result in a decreased phosphorylation of CUTL1 at Ser-1215. Therefore, a direct effect of the ERK pathway on the phosphorylation of CUTL1 at Ser-1215 is unlikely. The abilities of tumor cells to proliferate and migrate are essential hallmarks of cancer and prerequisites of local tumor progression and metastatic spread. The data presented here demonstrate that the transcription factor CUTL1, which has previously been shown as modulator of cell motility and invasive behavior in vitro and in vivo, is inhibited by PKA, a major regulatory pathway for tumor progression. We propose that the inhibition of CUTL1-mediated tumor progression by PKA accounts to a significant extent for the anti-tumoral effects of PKA seen in several tumor types such as leukemias, sarcomas, and gliomas expressing high levels of CUTL1 (35Chen T.C. Hinton D.R. Zidovetzki R. Hofman F.M. Lab. Investig. 1998; 78: 165-174PubMed Google Scholar, 48Weissinger E.M. Oettrich K. Evans C. Genieser H.G. Schwede F. Dangers M. Dammann E. Kolb H.J. Mischak H.

https://openalex.org/W2032976842,"Retinoid X receptor α (RXRα), functioning as either a homodimer or a heterodimer with peroxisome proliferator receptors, is known to be involved in manifesting antiproliferative effects in cells. Consequently, studies of RXRα functions and its coregulators have been in the focus for therapeutic approaches against cancer. Here we have discovered that 9-cis-retinoic acid (9-cis-RA), a RXRα-specific ligand, up-regulated the expression of transcriptional coregulatory protein PELP1 (proline-, glutamic acid-, and leucine-rich protein 1). PELP1 functioned as a coactivator of RXRα, increasing its transactivation function in response to 9-cis-RA as evident by the retinoid X receptor response element-luciferase assays. PELP1 was found to be a binding partner of RXRα, and the binding interactions were confirmed both in vitro and in vivo. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed greater formation and stability of RXRα homodimers on consensus oligonucleotides in PELP1-overexpressing clones in comparison to the pcDNA clones. The presence of PELP1 in these oligonucleotide-bound RXRα homodimers was proved by the supershift of the complex when incubated with PELP1-specific antibody. PELP1-overexpressing stable MCF-7 cells exhibited a significantly higher extent of 9-cis-RA-induced apoptosis than the control pcDNA clones. Silencing of PELP1 expression in parental MCF-7 cells and PELP1-overexpressing clones using PELP1-specific RNA-mediated interference compromised the susceptibility to 9-cis-RA-induced apoptosis. PELP1 could also function as a coactivator of the RXRα-peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPARγ) heterodimer as evident by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor response element-luciferase assay in response to both 9-cis-RA and PPARγ-specific ligands. This was reinforced by the higher propensity of PELP1-overexpressing clones to undergo differentiation in response to PPARγ-specific ligands. This study has revealed a novel facet of PELP1 functions and identified it to be an important potentiator of the antiproliferative effects of 9-cis-RA and PPARγ-specific ligands. Retinoid X receptor α (RXRα), functioning as either a homodimer or a heterodimer with peroxisome proliferator receptors, is known to be involved in manifesting antiproliferative effects in cells. Consequently, studies of RXRα functions and its coregulators have been in the focus for therapeutic approaches against cancer. Here we have discovered that 9-cis-retinoic acid (9-cis-RA), a RXRα-specific ligand, up-regulated the expression of transcriptional coregulatory protein PELP1 (proline-, glutamic acid-, and leucine-rich protein 1). PELP1 functioned as a coactivator of RXRα, increasing its transactivation function in response to 9-cis-RA as evident by the retinoid X receptor response element-luciferase assays. PELP1 was found to be a binding partner of RXRα, and the binding interactions were confirmed both in vitro and in vivo. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed greater formation and stability of RXRα homodimers on consensus oligonucleotides in PELP1-overexpressing clones in comparison to the pcDNA clones. The presence of PELP1 in these oligonucleotide-bound RXRα homodimers was proved by the supershift of the complex when incubated with PELP1-specific antibody. PELP1-overexpressing stable MCF-7 cells exhibited a significantly higher extent of 9-cis-RA-induced apoptosis than the control pcDNA clones.

This was reinforced by the higher propensity of PELP1-overexpressing clones to undergo differentiation in response to PPARγ-specific ligands. This study has revealed a novel facet of PELP1 functions and identified it to be an important potentiator of the antiproliferative effects of 9-cis-RA and PPARγ-specific ligands.

Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 835-839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5992) Google Scholar). On activation, the NR in their homodimeric or heterodimeric complexes with other NR bind to specific DNA sequences referred to as “response elements,” which are present in the regulatory elements of target genes. On DNA binding, the NR orchestrate gene transcription by interacting with the basal transcriptional machinery through bridging factors, referred to broadly as coactivator proteins. One of the potential functions of the coactivator proteins is to directly or indirectly remodel the local chromatin structure through covalent modification of histones (acetylation, phosphorylation, or methylation) resulting in opening of chromatin, greater accessibility of the target gene promoter to transcriptional machinery, and ultimately, gene transcription. Numerous families of coactivators of different NR have been identified. Their mode of interaction with the receptors and the molecular mechanism by which they function has been established. The most well studied coactivators include p300/CBP, p300/CBP-associated factor, and members of the p160 families, which include SRC-1, GRIP1/TIF2/SRC-2, and ACTR/AIB1/RAC3/SRC-3 (for review, see Ref. 2Lonard D.M. O'Malley B.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 126-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). These coactivators function by facilitating the initial penetration of the chromatin by histone acetylation. Coactivators, which utilize histone methylation for the same purpose like CARM1 and PRMT, have also been identified (3Stallcup M.R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3014-3020Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In addition to these families, several other coactivator proteins have been identified that function directly at the level of the preinitiation complex (PIC), enhancing its activity. This group includes TATA box-binding protein-associated factors (4Verrijzer C.P. Tjian R. Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 338-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), positive cofactors PC1, PC2, PC3, PC5, and PC52 (5Roeder R.G. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 201-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), and several multiprotein complexes that are related to thyroid hormone receptor-associated protein-mediator complex (6Malik S. Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 277-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Proline-, glutamic acid-, and leucine-rich protein 1 (PELP1) was a recent addition to the family of transcriptional coregulatory proteins and was identified as a novel estrogen receptor (ER) coactivator (7Vadlamudi R.K. Wang R.-A. Mazumdar A. Kim Y. Shin J. Sahin A. Kumar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38272-38279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). It is a protein of 1273 amino acids that is unusually rich in prolines (13.2%), glutamic acid (12.4%), and leucine (12.9%) and, hence, was named as PELP1. It has nine LXXLL motifs (NR box motifs), seven toward the N-terminal region, and two in the central region. It interacts with and significantly enhances the transcriptional function of ERα, indicating that it functions as an ER coactivator. PELP1 did not have the same effect on progesterone receptor and glucocorticoid receptor, indicating that it may be an ER-specific coactivator. Even though it has a molecular mass of 160 kDa, sequence analysis showed it was distinct from the p160 family of coactivators. The conserved domains of p160 proteins such as bHLH, PER, ARNT, and SIM homology domains are absent in PELP1. It could interact with transcriptional activators like CBP and p300 in vivo, which suggest that PELP1 activates ER transcription by recruiting general coactivators such as CBP and p300. PELP1 also interacts with pRb (retinoblastoma protein), a cell cycle switch protein, inducing its hyperphosphorylation in an estrogen-dependent manner, increasing estrogen-stimulated cell proliferation (8Balasenthil S. Vadlamudi R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 276: 22119-22127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Upon stimulation of cells with estrogen, there was an enhanced recruitment of PELP1 to the estrogen-responsive promoters and colocalization with the acetylated histone H3. Increased levels of PELP1-associated acetyltransferase activity were observed on estrogen stimulation. PELP1 also interacts with histones H1 and H3 and increases transcription by chromatin modification involving the displacement of H1 (9Nair S.S. Mishra S.K. Yang Z. Balasenthil S. Kumar R. Vadlamudi R.K. Cancer Res. 2000; 64: 6416-6423Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In another study, PELP1 was confirmed to act as an ER coactivator but as a corepressor of glucocorticoid receptor and of non-NR sequence-specific transcription factors tested, including activating protein 1, nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), and ternary complex factor/serum response factor (10Choi Y.B. Ko J.K. Shin J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50930-50941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The noted repressor activity of PELP1 was due to its ability to recruit HDAC2, which in turn might mask the acetylation of histones H3 and H4 and prevent them from acting as substrates for histone acetyltransferases. Ligand binding to the ER reverses the repressor role of PELP1, with a parallel increase in the status of histone hyper-acetylation. More recently it was also shown that PELP1 functions as a coactivator of signal transducers and activator 3 (STAT3), stimulating its transcriptional activity (11Manavathi B. Nair S.S. Wang R.-A. Kumar R. Vadlamudi R.K. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 5571-5577Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This positive regulation is brought about by the ability of PELP1 to augment growth factor-induced phosphorylation of serine 727 of STAT3 via activation of the Src-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. Collectively, emerging evidence suggests that PELP1 can function as a positive and a negative regulator of transcription in a transcription factor-specific manner. Retinoids (natural retinoic acids and their synthetic derivatives) are derivatives of vitamin A. They are non-steroidal hormones that play a vital role in the development and homeostasis of almost every vertebrate tissue by regulating embryogenesis, cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis (12Altucci L. Gronemeyer H. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 12: 460-468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 13Ross S.A. McCaffery P.J. Drager U.C. De Luca L.M. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1021-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). Retinoids transduce their signals through two well studied classes of receptors namely, retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and retinoid X receptor (RXR). Three isotypes in each class of the retinoid receptors have been identified and are referred to as α, β, and γ RARs (or RXRs), and each isotype is encoded by a separate gene (1Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 835-839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5992) Google Scholar, 14Chambon P. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 940-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2573) Google Scholar). RXRs represent a unique class of NR as they function as obligate members of majority of NR heterodimers reported. They heterodimerize not only with RARs but also with several other receptors such as thyroid hormone receptors, vitamin D receptors (15Kliewer S.A. Umesono K. Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Nature. 1992; 355: 446-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar), and peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) (16Bardot O. Aldridge T.C. Latruffe N. Green S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The RXRs bind with stereo-selectivity to the retinoid 9-cis-retinoic acid (9-cis-RA). In addition to forming heterodimers, RXRs bind to 9-cis-RA and form functionally active homodimers that bind to the target DNA sequences (RXRE) and activate gene transcription (17Sarraf P Mueller E Jones D. King F.J. DeAngelo D.J. Partridge J.B. Holden S.A. Chen L.B. Singer S. Fletcher C. Spiegelman B.M. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1046-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). In the present investigation we discovered that 9-cis-RA transcriptionally up-regulates expression of the PELP1 gene. PELP1, in turn physically binds with RXRα and functions as a coactivator, activating the transcriptional functions of RXRα homodimer and also of its permissive heterodimer with PPARγ. Consequently, PELP1 potentiates the apoptotic effects of 9-cis-RA and the differentiation-inducing effects of PPARγ-activating ligands. Cell Culture and Reagents—MCF-7 cells were purchased from American Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC) and were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and F-12 medium (1:1) (Mediatech, Herndon, VA) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Antibodies for RXRα and PPARγ were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-Her2 antibody was from Labvision Corp (Fremont, CA). Anti-T7 tag antibody was from Bethyl Laboratories (Montgomery, TX), and anti-vinculin antibody was from Sigma. Anti-PELP1antibody was used as reported earlier (7Vadlamudi R.K. Wang R.-A. Mazumdar A. Kim Y. Shin J. Sahin A. Kumar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38272-38279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Anti-mouse and anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibodies were from Amersham Biosciences. 9-cis-Retinoic acid, ciglitazone, and troglitazone were from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). The making and characterization of pcDNA, T7-PELP1, and T7-PELP1 H1-mutant protein-overexpressing cell lines were described earlier (9Nair S.S. Mishra S.K. Yang Z. Balasenthil S. Kumar R. Vadlamudi R.K. Cancer Res. 2000; 64: 6416-6423Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar). These cells were cultured in RPMI medium (Mediatech) with 5% fetal calf serum and G418 (1 mg/ml). Reporter Luciferase Assays—Cells were seeded in 6-well tissue culture plates 24 h before transfection. Subconfluent cells were transfected with PPRE-luciferase (17Sarraf P Mueller E Jones D. King F.J. DeAngelo D.J. Partridge J.B. Holden S.A. Chen L.B. Singer S. Fletcher C. Spiegelman B.M. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1046-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar) or RXRE-tk-luciferase (18Tanaka T. Dancheck B.L. Trifiletti L.C. Birnkrant R.E. Taylor B.J. Garfield S.H. Thorgeirsson U. De Luca L.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3972-3982Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). After 24 h the cells were treated with RXR- or PPAR-specific ligands as appropriate. Luciferase assay was done after 24 h using the luciferase assay kit (Promega). Each experiment was repeated a minimum of three times. The PELP1 promoter luciferase constructs were used as reported earlier (19Mishra S.K. Balasenthil S. Nguyen D. Vadlamudi R.K. Gene (Amst.). 2004; 330: 115-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Glutathione S-transferase (GST) Pulldown Assay—In vitro transcription and translation of RXRα was done using a T7-TNT kit (Promega), where 1 μg of cDNA in pcDNA 3.1 vector was translated in the presence of [35S]methionine in a reaction volume of 50 μl. The reaction mixture was diluted to 1 ml with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (25 mm Tris, 50 mm NaCl, and 1% Nonidet P-40). An equal aliquot was used for each GST pulldown assay. Translation and product size were verified by subjecting 2 μl of the reaction mixture to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The GST pulldown assays were performed by incubating equal amounts of GST and GST-tagged PELP1 deletion constructs, immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) with in vitro translated 35S-labeled RXRα to which binding was being tested. Bound proteins were isolated by incubating the mixture for 3 h at 4 °C, washing 5 times with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, eluting the proteins with 2× SDS buffer, and separating them by SDS-PAGE. The bound proteins were then visualized by autoradiography. RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA from the cells was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and treated with DNase for 15 min after which DNase was inactivated by heating the samples at 65 °C for 10 min. The cellular retinol-binding protein (CRBP II) mRNA levels were analyzed by RT-PCR with specific primers 5′-cactagcacattccgcaact-3′ and 5′-aggtcagctccaggtacagc-3′. Primers used for acyl-CoA synthase were 5′-ttatcgaccggaaaaagcac-3′ and 5′-gtcagaaggccattgtcgat-3′. Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—Cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed in 4% phosphate-buffered paraformaldehyde for 15 min. Cells were permeabilized in methanol at –20 °C for 4 min. After permeabilization, cells were incubated with primary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature, washed 3 times in phosphate-buffered saline, and then incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated with 546-Alexa (red) or 488-Alexa (green) from Molecular Probes (Invitrogen). The DNA dye Topro-3 (Molecular Probes) was used for nuclear localization (blue). Confocal scanning analysis was performed using an Olympus FV300 laser scanning confocal microscope in accordance with established methods, utilizing sequential laser excitation to minimize the possibility of fluorescence emission bleed-through. Each image is a three-dimensional reconstructed stack of serial Z sections at the same cellular level and magnification. Co-localization of two proteins is shown yellow for red and green fluorescence. Lipid Droplet Staining with Oil Red O—Cells were seeded into 6-well plates containing a glass coverslip in each well and cultured for 5 days in the absence or presence of 5 μm troglitazone. Subsequently, cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde and washed with phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min at room temperature and later stained with 1% oil red O for 10 min. Excess stain was washed with 60% isopropanol followed by 1 water wash. Cells were later stained with hematoxylene for 1–2 min followed by 1 wash with water. RNAi Transfection—PELP1 RNAi was a Smartpool mix purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). RNAi transfection was performed using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cell Death and Cell Cycle Progression Assay—For the cell proliferation assay, 10,000 cells were plated/well in a 6-well culture plate. After 24 h cells were treated with 9-cis-RA (2.5 μm). 5 days later cell numbers were measured by using Beckman Coulter Counter. A comparison of the cell numbers of untreated cells to those treated with 9-cis-RA provided a measure of the extent of cell death. For cell cycle progression assay, cells were treated with 9-cis-RA (2.5 μm) and after 3 days stained with propidium iodide and analyzed by fluorescence-assisted cell sorting (BD Biosciences). Early apoptosis was detected by using an annexin V-apoptosis detection kit (Sigma) after cells were treated with 9-cis-RA (2.5 μm) for 16 h. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—EMSA analysis with radiolabeled probe was done with commercial double-stranded RXRE consensus sequence probes purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The probes were end-labeled using T4-polynucleotide kinase (Invitrogen) and 32P-labeled ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). 9-cis-Retinoic Acid Transcriptionally Up-regulates PELP1 Expression—The promoter region of PELP1 has been cloned and characterized with regard to the estrogen-induced transcriptional up-regulation (19Mishra S.K. Balasenthil S. Nguyen D. Vadlamudi R.K. Gene (Amst.). 2004; 330: 115-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Analysis of the 2-kilobase PELP1 promoter sequence for putative transcription factor binding elements employing the program Matinspector Professional Version 7.2 (20Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2419) Google Scholar) showed at least 15 possible RXRα heterodimer binding sites. This prompted us to check whether 9-cis-RA, an RXR-specific ligand, would transcriptionally up-regulate PELP1 expression. Treatment of MCF-7 cells with 9-cis-RA (2.5 μm) led to enhancement of the PELP1 mRNA expression with in 6 h of treatment as evident by the RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 1A). Treatment of MCF-7 cells with 9-cis-RA for 24 h and subsequent Western blotting analysis of the total cell proteins with PELP1-specific antibody showed a clear increase in the level of PELP1 protein when compared with the control cells treated with Me2SO in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B, upper panel). A similar up-regulation of PELP1 was observed in HeLa cells on treatment with 9-cis-RA (Fig. 1B, lower panel). Simultaneous treatment of cells with 9-cis-RA and actinomycin D, an inhibitor of transcription, blocked this up-regulation of PELP1 expression (Fig. 1C). On the other hand, similar treatment of cells with cyclohexamide, a protein synthesis inhibitor, did not affect the 9-cis-RA-induced up-regulation of PELP1 expression (Fig. 1C). This suggests that the increase in the level of PELP1 induced by 9-cis-RA was at the transcriptional level. To further validate the transcription stimulating effect of 9-cis-RA on the PELP1 promoter and identify the possible 9-cis-RA-responsive region, we next carried out luc-reporter assays with PELP1 promoter and its deletion luciferase constructs (Fig. 1D). In response to 9-cis-RA treatment, a 2-fold increase in the luciferase activity with construct A, which has the complete 2-kilobase PELP1 promoter, was observed. The activity of PELP1 promoter construct C, encompassing the 700-bp region upstream of the putative start site, exhibited more than a 3-fold induction of luciferase activity. This region has four putative RXRα binding sites including one RXR/LXR, one PXR/RXR half-site, and two CAR/RXR binding consensus sequence, suggesting that this region might be responsible for the responsiveness of 9-cis-RA. Together, these results presented in Fig. 1 established that the PELP1 gene is a target of 9-cis-RA signaling. PELP1 Functions as a Coactivator of RXRα—In addition to serving as a coactivator of ERα, PELP1 is a broad-range coregulator of several transcription factors (7Vadlamudi R.K. Wang R.-A. Mazumdar A. Kim Y. Shin J. Sahin A. Kumar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38272-38279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 9Nair S.S. Mishra S.K. Yang Z. Balasenthil S. Kumar R. Vadlamudi R.K. Cancer Res. 2000; 64: 6416-6423Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 10Choi Y.B. Ko J.K. Shin J. J. Biol.

Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 5571-5577Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Because 9-cis-RA up-regulates PELP1 expression (Fig. 1), we next examined the possibility of PELP1 in regulating retinoid signaling. To investigate this we examined the effect of PELP1 on the RXRE-tk-luc-reporter assay in MCF-7 cells with transient overexpression of PELP1. Stimulation of cells with 9-cis-RA resulted in about a 2.5-fold induction of reporter activity by PELP1 as compared with about a 1.3-fold stimulation by control pcDNA, suggesting that PELP1 acts as a coactivator of RXRα (Fig. 2A). To gain further insights into PELP1 regulation of the RXRα pathway, we next used MCF-7 cells that stably overexpress PELP1. Results showed that 9-cis-RA was a potent stimulator of RXRα transactivation activity in cells with overexpression of PELP1 (Fig. 2B). In addition to recruiting chromatin modifiers such as CBP/p300, the coactivator function of PELP1 also requires binding and displacement of histone H1, which binds to DNA flanking the nucleosome core and represses the basal transcriptional activity of a variety of DNA binding factors including NRs. To show the significance of the histone H1 binding region of PELP1, we also conducted the RXRE-luc assay in MCF-7 cells stably expressing PELP1 histone H1-binding mutant protein lacking the C-terminal 253 amino acid stretch and incapable of binding to histone H1 (reported in Nair et al. Ref. 9Nair S.S. Mishra S.K. Yang Z. Balasenthil S. Kumar R. Vadlamudi R.K. Cancer Res. 2000; 64: 6416-6423Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We found a significant reduction in the ability of PELP1-H1 mutant to transactivate RXRα, as there was only a 2-fold induction of RXRE-luc-reporter by 9-cis-RA in MCF-7/PELP1-H1 mutant cells as compared with a 4-fold induction in the case of MCF-7/PELP1 cells (Fig. 2B). These results confirmed that PELP1 could function as coactivator of RXRα and, thus, potentiate the effect of 9-cis-RA signaling in cells. The expression of T7-tagged PELP1-WT and PELP1 H1-mutant form in the respective stable clones has been shown (Fig. 2C, upper panel). The expression of similar levels of RXRα and PPARγ proteins in MCF-7/pcDNA, MCF-7/PELP1, and MCF-7/PELP-H1 mutant cells was demonstrated by the Western blot analysis (Fig. 2C, lower panel). This ensured that the differential up-regulation of RXRE-luc observed in cells was due primarily to up-regulation of a fully functional PELP1 and not to alteration of the levels of the RXRα itself. To show the physiological relevance of the role of PELP1 as RXRα coactivator, RT-PCR analysis was done in the stable clones for the expression of CRBP II, an RXRα target gene. In response to 9-cis-RA stimulation, the expression of CRBP II in PELP WT clones was severalfold higher when compared with the pcDNA clones (Fig. 2D), which provides important proof of the potentiation of the RXRα transactivation function by PELP1. PELP1 Physically Interacts with RXRα—Because PELP1 is a coactivator of RXRα, we next investigated whether PELP1 interacts with RXRα. Results from the GST pulldown assays, utilizing GST-tagged PELP1 deletion constructs and 35S-labeled RXRα, indicated that the N-terminal 1–400 amino acid region of PELP1, which has seven of the nine NR boxes in PELP1, has the highest binding affinity to RXRα (Fig. 3A, construct A). A comparatively lower binding affinity was also shown by PELP1 construct B, which encompasses the region of amino acids 400–600 from the N-terminal region. No binding was observed by the deletion constructs C and D (Fig. 3A). The NR boxes are structural motifs that form an amphipathic helix employed by the coactivators to dock with the ligand activated NRs. Results from the above in vitro binding studies suggested that PELP1 may utilize its NR box-rich region to physically interact with RXRα. To validate the noted interaction of PELP1 with RXRα in the physiologic setting, we next performed co-immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot analysis from cellular extracts. Because the PELP1 antibody does not work well in immunoprecipitation assays, we used MCF-7/PELP1 cells, which allowed us to immunoprecipitate the T7-PELP1 by anti-T7 antibody. MCF-7/PELP1 and control cells were stimulated with 9-cis-RA or with the vehicle Me2SO, T7-PELP1 was immunoprecipitated from the cell lysates using an anti-T7-antibody, and immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with RXRα antibody. We found that RXRα indeed interacted with T7-PELP1, and such interaction was further enhanced by 9-cis-RA stimulation (Fig. 3B). Conversely, we immunoprecipitated the cell lysates with anti-RXRα antibody and showed co-precipitation of PELP1 (Fig. 3C). No PELP1 was detected in the lane where proteins were immunoprecipitated with control IgG. As an additional validation of in vivo PELP1-RXRα interaction, we used scanning confocal microscopy and co-localization of PELP1, and RXRα was visualized by immunofluorescence. Localization of PELP1 and RXRα was detected by red and green fluorescence, respectively.

In the present study, we examined the regulation of prothrombotic and antithrombotic molecules by transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) during distinct phases of the cell cycle in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. In the absence of TGF-beta1, the expression of thrombomodulin, the plasminogen activators u-PA and t-PA, and their inhibitor PAI-1 was significantly increased in the S/G2 compared to the G1 phase. Treatment of endothelial cells with TGF-beta1, however, resulted in elevated expression of PAI-1 specifically in the S/G2 phase, while t-PA and u-PA increased to the same extent in both the G1 and S/G2 phase. These findings demonstrate that the expression of a subset of hemostatically relevant proteins is regulated during endothelial cell cycle and that TGF-beta1 can differentially modulate cell cycle-controlled protein expression."
