https://openalex.org/W2110699703,"Little is known about the design principles of transcriptional regulation networks that control gene expression in cells. Recent advances in data collection and analysis, however, are generating unprecedented amounts of information about gene regulation networks. To understand these complex wiring diagrams, we sought to break down such networks into basic building blocks. We generalize the notion of motifs, widely used for sequence analysis, to the level of networks. We define 'network motifs' as patterns of interconnections that recur in many different parts of a network at frequencies much higher than those found in randomized networks. We applied new algorithms for systematically detecting network motifs to one of the best-characterized regulation networks, that of direct transcriptional interactions in Escherichia coli. We find that much of the network is composed of repeated appearances of three highly significant motifs. Each network motif has a specific function in determining gene expression, such as generating temporal expression programs and governing the responses to fluctuating external signals. The motif structure also allows an easily interpretable view of the entire known transcriptional network of the organism. This approach may help define the basic computational elements of other biological networks."
https://openalex.org/W1999777663,"Stochastic mechanisms are ubiquitous in biological systems. Biochemical reactions that involve small numbers of molecules are intrinsically noisy, being dominated by large concentration fluctuations1,2,3. This intrinsic noise has been implicated in the random lysis/lysogeny decision of bacteriophage-λ4, in the loss of synchrony of circadian clocks5,6 and in the decrease of precision of cell signals7. We sought to quantitatively investigate the extent to which the occurrence of molecular fluctuations within single cells (biochemical noise) could explain the variation of gene expression levels between cells in a genetically identical population (phenotypic noise). We have isolated the biochemical contribution to phenotypic noise from that of other noise sources by carrying out a series of differential measurements. We varied independently the rates of transcription and translation of a single fluorescent reporter gene in the chromosome of Bacillus subtilis, and we quantitatively measured the resulting changes in the phenotypic noise characteristics. We report that of these two parameters, increased translational efficiency is the predominant source of increased phenotypic noise. This effect is consistent with a stochastic model of gene expression in which proteins are produced in random and sharp bursts. Our results thus provide the first direct experimental evidence of the biochemical origin of phenotypic noise, demonstrating that the level of phenotypic variation in an isogenic population can be regulated by genetic parameters."

In contrast, the immune modulating drug FTY720 is efficacious in a variety of transplant and autoimmune models without inducing a generalized immunosuppressed state and is effective in human kidney transplantation. FTY720 elicits a lymphopenia resulting from a reversible redistribution of lymphocytes from circulation to secondary lymphoid tissues by unknown mechanisms. Using FTY720 and several analogs, we show now that FTY720 is phosphorylated by sphingosine kinase; the phosphorylated compound is a potent agonist at four sphingosine 1-phosphate receptors and represents the therapeutic principle in a rodent model of multiple sclerosis. Our results suggest that FTY720, after phosphorylation, acts through sphingosine 1-phosphate signaling pathways to modulate chemotactic responses and lymphocyte trafficking.

G protein-coupled receptor sphingosine 1-phosphate experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate high pressure liquid chromatography FTY720 is derived from ISP-1 (myriocin), a fungal metabolite that is an eternal youth nostrum in traditional Chinese herbal medicine (1Fujita T.

The compound (2-amino-2-[2-(4-octylphenyl)ethyl]propane-1,3-diol) is a novel, high potency immune modulating agent that is remarkably effective in a variety of autoimmune and transplant models including islet transplantation (2Brinkmann V. Pinschewer D.D. Feng L. Chen S. Transplantation. 2001; 72: 764-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and has recently proven to be effective in renal transplantation in man (3Tedesco T. Kahan B. Mourad G. Vanrenterghem Y. Grinyo J. Weimar W. Pellet P. Chodoff L. Sablinski T. Am. J. Transplant. 2001; 1: S243Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Unlike the currently used immunosuppressive agents (e.g. the calcineurin inhibitors cyclosporin and tacrolimus), FTY720 does not inhibit T cell activation and proliferation and in rodent models does not impair immunity to systemic viral infection (4Pinschewer D.D. Ochsenbein A.F. Odermatt B. Brinkmann V. Hengartner H. Zinkernagel R.M. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 5761-5770Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). If confirmed in man, the latter property provides a striking advantage over current immunosuppressive therapies. FTY720 apparently sequesters lymphocytes from circulation to secondary lymph tissue compartments (5Chiba K. Yanagawa Y. Yasubuchi Y. Kataoka H. Kawaguchi T. Ohtsuki M. Hoshino Y. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 5037-5044PubMed Google Scholar) with concomitant reduction of specific effector T cells recirculating from the lymph nodes to inflamed peripheral tissues (4Pinschewer D.D. Ochsenbein A.F. Odermatt B. Brinkmann V. Hengartner H. Zinkernagel R.M. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 5761-5770Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) and graft sites (6Yanagawa Y. Sugahara K. Kataoka H. Kawaguchi T. Masubuchi Y. Chiba K. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 5493-5499PubMed Google Scholar). FTY720 does not act via the lymphocyte-homing chemokine receptor CCR-7 because FTY720 is active both in CCR-7-deficient mice and plt (paucity of lymph node T cells) mice, which lack CCR-7 ligands (CCL-19 and CCL-21) (7Henning G.

FTY720-induced lymphocyte homing is sensitive to suppression by pertussis toxin (6Yanagawa Y. Sugahara K. Kataoka H. Kawaguchi T. Masubuchi Y. Chiba K. J.

The affected GPCR(s) is on the lymphocyte since fluorescently labeled lymphocytes treated with pertussis toxin ex vivo and transferred to mice are not depleted by FTY720 in vivo (8Brinkmann V. Pinschewer D.D. Chiba K. Feng L. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 49-52Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The structural similarity of FTY720 and sphingosine has prompted speculation that the drug might act via the sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor S1P4 (formerly Edg-6) 2The International Union of Pharmacology subcommittee on lysophospholipid receptor nomenclature has recommended that the colloquial “Edg” nomenclature be replaced with S1P (or lysophosphatidic acid (LPA)) subscript number, where the number indicates chronology of molecular cloning. Thus for S1P receptors, Edg-1 becomes S1P1, Edg-5 becomes S1P2, Edg-3 becomes S1P3, Edg-6 becomes S1P4, and Edg-8 becomes S1P5. that is known to be expressed by lymphocytes (9Gräler M.H. Bernhardt G. Lipp M. Genomics. 1998; 53: 164-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). S1P is a pleiotropic lysophospholipid mediator; the prominent cellular responses to applied S1P are transient calcium mobilization, inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, escape from apoptosis (10Cuvillier O.

Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 155-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). The physiologic role of S1P remains undefined although cell culture experiments and the phenotype of a mouse with the S1P1 receptor gene ablated suggest a role for S1P in vascular maturation (14Lee M.-J.

Investig. 2000; 106: 951-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar). Responses to S1P are mediated through a set of five cell surface GPCRs (S1P1–5), and the various effects of S1P have been attributed to interactions with one or more of these receptors (16Hla T. Lee M.J. Ancellin N. Paik J.K. Kluk M.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1875-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). S1P is formed by the action of sphingosine kinase on sphingosine (17Kohama T.A.

The activity of this enzyme is increased in response to external stimuli (18Xia P. Gamble J.R. Rye K.A. Wang L. Hii C.S.T. Cockerill P. Khew-Goodall Y. Bert A.G. Barter P.J. Vadas M.A. Proc. Natl.

Kohama T. Edsall L. Nava V. Cuvillier O. Poulton S. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 545-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Sphingosine is converted rapidly to S1P when added to cells (21Ancellin N. Colmont C., Su, J., Li, Q. Mittereder N. Chae S.-S. Stefansson S. Liau G. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6667-6675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), while the route of S1P degradation to sphingosine might proceed via an ectophosphatase (22Kai M. Wada I. Imai S. Sakane F. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24572-24578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). To learn whether FTY720 might participate in the sphingosine-S1P signaling cascade, we performed the studies described herein. The assays were performed as described previously (23Prieschl E.E. Csonga R. Novotny V. Kikuchi G. Baumruker T. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) using mouse recombinant sphingosine kinase 1a expressed in Escherichia coli. The reaction buffer contained 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 15 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, and 0.05% Triton X-100. Substrates (sphingosine, FTY720, or AAL) were incubated at various concentrations with 10 nm sphingosine kinase, 10 μm ATP/0.5 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) at 30 °C for 1 h. Lipids were extracted with 2 volumes of CHCl3/methanol (1:2), the organic extraction product was dried, and the pellet was redissolved. The lipids were separated on a thin layer chromatography plate using a 1-butanol/acetic acid/water (6:2:2) solvent system after which the plate was exposed to x-ray film to detect phosphorus-32-labeled lipids. Mouse organs (as indicated) were prepared and kept for 24 h in medium containing tritiated FTY720. Single cells were prepared from those organs by cell strainer, cells were lysed, and a lipid extraction was performed from 106 cells of each organ or from the corresponding culture supernatant. Extraction and analysis by thin layer chromatography was done as described above. Membranes were prepared from either insect Sf9 cells that were infected with recombinant baculoviruses encoding receptor and G proteins (for the S1P1 receptor), HEK293T cells transfected with DNAs encoding S1P receptors as well as G proteins (S1P4 and S1P5 receptors), or rat hepatoma RH7777 cells that were transfected with receptor DNA alone (S1P3 receptor). After 48 h, cells were collected, and crude microsomal membranes were prepared. Ligand stimulation of [γ-35S]GTPγS binding was performed as described previously (24Im D.-S. Clemens J. Macdonald T.L. Lynch K.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14053-14060Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In membranes from all three cell types, agonist stimulation of [γ-35S]GTPγS binding was entirely dependent on exogenous receptor. FTY720 and AAL were dissolved in water and administered by gavage to Lewis rats at various doses. FTY720-P and AFD were dissolved in water:Me2SO (5:1, v/v) and injected intraperitoneally into C3H mice (1 mg/kg). Blood was collected from the tail vein of mice or the sublingual vein of rats 6 h after drug administration and subjected to hematology using an automated Technicon H1-E analyzer (Bayer Diagnostics, Zürich, Switzerland). Human CD4+ T cells were negatively selected from Ficoll-isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells by magnetic cell sorting according to standard procedures using anti-CD8-, anti-CD20-, and anti-CD14-coated Miltenyi Biotec (Gladbach, Germany) magnetic beads. CD4+ T cells (106/ml) were incubated with increasing concentrations of compounds for 4 h. Cells were stained for expression of phosphatidylserine in the outer leaflet of the membranes using the Annexin-V-FLUOS staining kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and positive cells were detected by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Wistar rats were immunized with an emulsion of bovine spinal cord in complete Freund's adjuvant as described previously (25Bolton C. Borel J.F. Cuzner M.L. J. Neurol. Sci. 1982; 56: 147-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Two-week oral treatment with FTY720 (aqueous solution) or the enantiomers (dissolved in water:Me2SO, 10:1, v/v) was started on day 0 using a dose of 0.3 mg/kg/day. Positive controls received vehicle alone. Animals (10 per group) were monitored daily and graded according to disease symptoms: 1, flaccid tail; 2, hind limb weakness or ataxia; 3, full paralysis of hind limbs. We used a set of FTY720-like compounds to determine sphingosine kinase and S1P receptor activity and correlate these with assays of lymphocyte function. In addition to FTY720, we tested both enantiomers (AAL) of an analog described by Kiuchi et al.(26Kiuchi M. Adachi K. Kohara T. Minoguchi M. Hanano T. Aoki Y. Mishina T. Arita M. Nakao N. Ohtsuki M. Hoshino Y. Teshima K. Chiba K. Sasaki S. Fujita T. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 2946-2961Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) wherein a hydroxymethylene substituent of FTY720 was replaced by a methyl group (Fig. 1). These enantiomers have very different activities; the ID50 values for decreasing circulating T lymphocytes in rats were reported to be 0.009 and >1 mg/kg for the R- and S-enantiomers, respectively, while the ID50 value for FTY720 in the same system was 0.024 mg/kg (26Kiuchi M. Adachi K. Kohara T. Minoguchi M. Hanano T. Aoki Y. Mishina T. Arita M. Nakao N. Ohtsuki M. Hoshino Y. Teshima K. Chiba K. Sasaki S. Fujita T. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 2946-2961Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). We first asked whether these compounds were substrates for sphingosine kinase. Recombinant mouse sphingosine kinase 1a catalyzed the phosphorylation of FTY720 and (R)-AAL but not (S)-AAL (Fig. 2, Aand B). Moreover lymphoid tissue including Peyer's patches, spleen, and lymph nodes effectively phosphorylated FTY720, while heart, liver, and kidney contained little of the phosphorylated drug (Fig.2C). This pattern of active tissues best matches the RNA localization of sphingosine kinase type 1 (27Liu H. Sugiura M. Nava V.E. Edsall L.C. Kono K. Poulton S. Milstein S. Kohama T. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19513-19520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). The concept that phosphorylated FTY720 might be the active principle is intriguing and suggests that an alcohol/phosphate cycling of FTY720/FTY720-P takes place in vivo as occurs with sphingosine/S1P. Indeed FTY720 was converted extensively to FTY720-P in vivo, resulting in up to 4-fold higher blood levels of FTY720-P compared with parent FTY720 (Table I). To learn whether FTY720-P is dephosphorylated in vivo, we administered single doses of FTY720-P to mice and assayed blood levels of FTY720 after 24 h. FTY720 could be detected after the lowest dose (0.1 mg/kg) of FTY720-P and increased in a dose-dependent fashion (Table I). We next determined whether synthetic phosphate derivatives, namely FTY720-P, (R)-AFD, and (S)-AFD, which resemble S1P (Fig. 1), were agonists at S1P receptors. To interrogate the individual S1P receptors, we used a membrane-based [γ-35S]GTPγS binding assay that allows direct comparison of the rank order potencies (pEC50) and relative efficacies (Emax) of agonist ligands at isolated receptors (24Im D.-S. Clemens J. Macdonald T.L. Lynch K.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14053-14060Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). All of our compounds were agonists at the S1P4 receptor, although FTY720-P and (R)-AFD were far more potent than their non-phosphorylated congeners (Fig.3). Both FTY720-P and (R)-AFD were high potency agonists also at the S1P1, S1P3, and S1P5 receptors (Table II), but the corresponding alcohols (FTY720 and AAL) were not efficacious at these three receptors (data not shown). Although FTY720-P behaved as a partial agonist in the [γ-35S]GTPγS binding assay (Table II), this compound was a full agonist in whole cell assays of inhibition of cAMP accumulation where there exists more amplification of signal (data not shown). None of our compounds were active at the S1P2 receptor in our assays at concentrations up to 10 μm. The receptor activation data are consistent with ligand binding measurements, which demonstrate a high affinity interaction between FTY720-P and (R)-AFD but not (S)-AFD and the S1P receptors (data not shown). Finally the compounds were not active at the three receptors for a structurally related lysophospholipid mediator, lysophosphatidic acid (data not shown).Table IMetabolism of FTY720 and FTY720-P in rodentsCompound administeredDoseCompound detected1-aCompound was detected by HPLC separation after extraction from blood pools from three animals.FTY720FTY720-P3 h8 h24 h72 h3 h8 h24 h72 hmg/kgng/mlFTY7201-bFTY720 administered to Wistar rats (oral).7.5851337324179383437109FTY7201-cFTY720 or FTY720-P administered to C3H mice (intraperitoneal).0.1ND1-dND, not determined.ND1.15NDNDNDNDNDFTY7201-cFTY720 or FTY720-P administered to C3H mice (intraperitoneal).0.3NDND6.20NDNDNDNDNDFTY720-P1-cFTY720 or FTY720-P administered to C3H mice (intraperitoneal).0.1NDND0.15NDNDNDNDNDFTY720-P1-cFTY720 or FTY720-P administered to C3H mice (intraperitoneal).0.3NDND1.06NDNDNDNDNDFTY720-P1-cFTY720 or FTY720-P administered to C3H mice (intraperitoneal).1.0NDND4.91NDNDNDNDND1-a Compound was detected by HPLC separation after extraction from blood pools from three animals.1-b FTY720 administered to Wistar rats (oral).1-c FTY720 or FTY720-P administered to C3H mice (intraperitoneal).1-d ND, not determined.

Open table in a new tab To learn whether this pattern of activity is recapitulated in vivo, we determined the potency of our compounds in reducing numbers of circulating T lymphocytes. FTY720 and (R)-AAL potently reduced circulating T lymphocyte levels in rats in a dose-dependent manner, whereas (S)-AAL and sphingosine were completely inactive at doses up to 1 mg/kg (Fig.4A). We obtained the analogous result with the respective phosphorylated compounds; a 1 mg/kg bolus injection of FTY720-P or (R)-AFD reduced circulating T cells by about 70%, whereas (S)-AFD and S1P were inactive with this dosing regimen (Fig. 4B). The lymphopenic activity of FTY720 and (R)-AAL in vivo (Fig. 4 and Ref. 25Bolton C. Borel J.F. Cuzner M.L. J. Neurol. Sci. 1982; 56: 147-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) thus can be explained by their metabolism to the phosphorylated forms (FTY720-P and (R)-AFD), which are potent agonists at multiple S1P receptors. The lack of efficacy of (S)-AAL in decreasing circulating lymphocytes cannot be credited only to its failure as a substrate for sphingosine kinase because even when phosphorylated (synthetically) to form (S)AFD, it lacks affinity for S1P receptors (Table II). FTY720 evokes apoptosis in lymphocytes at micromolar concentrations, prompting the idea that the drug acts by killing lymphocytes (28Matsuda S. Minowa A. Suzuki S. Koyasu S. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3321-3326PubMed Google Scholar). We consider this mechanism highly unlikely in view of the low nanomolar levels (Cmax < 50 nm) of FTY720 realized in the blood of rats treated with the high dose of 1 mg/kg (29Nikolova Z. Hof A. Baumlin Y. Hof R.P. Transplantation. 2001; 72: 168-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Nevertheless we determined whether the apoptotic potential of our compounds correlated with activities in vitro or in vivo. We observed apoptotic responses only in T cells treated with micromolar concentrations of non-phosphorylated compounds (Table III). This pattern is reminiscent of reports of the activity of sphingosine and S1P where sphingosine is associated with apoptosis and S1P is associated with protection from apoptosis (10Cuvillier O.

The apoptotic responses elicited by the non-phosphorylated compounds were neither stereoselective nor inhibited by prior pertussis toxin treatment (data not shown); both properties contrast the behavior of these compounds in mice or rats regarding the depletion of circulating lymphocytes (7Henning G.

Open table in a new tab The unique mechanism that apparently underlies the immune modulating effects of FTY720, i.e. increased homing of T cells toward the lymphatic system and away from inflammatory tissues (5Chiba K. Yanagawa Y. Yasubuchi Y. Kataoka H. Kawaguchi T. Ohtsuki M. Hoshino Y. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 5037-5044PubMed Google Scholar), provides an opportunity for therapy of autoimmune disorders that does not exist with current immunosuppressive agents. Therefore, we tested FTY720 and both enantiomers of AAL in EAE, which is a primary model of human multiple sclerosis (31Steinman L. Neuron. 1999; 24: 511-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Treatment of Wistar rats with FTY720 or (R)-AAL (0.3 mg/kg/day) completely prevented the development of EAE, whereas (S)-AAL was entirely inactive (Fig. 5). Thus the prophylactic activities of the compounds in this model are entirely consistent with their activity on S1P receptors and their potential to reduce circulating lymphocytes. Administration of FTY720 somehow resets a rheostat that apportions lymphocytes between the circulatory and secondary lymphoid tissue compartments. We have now documented that FTY720 and an analog ((R)-AAL), after phosphorylation to FTY720-P and (R)-AFD, are high affinity agonists at four (of five) S1P receptors. The correlation of substrate activity (Fig. 2), agonism at S1P receptors (Fig. 3 and Table II), induction of lymphopenia (Fig. 4), and activity in the EAE model (Fig. 5) suggests strongly that FTY720 and an analog (i.e. (R)-AAL) function ultimately as S1P mimetics that increase the lymphocyte homing response. The failure of sphingosine and S1P to evoke lymphopenia when administered to rats (Fig. 4B) might relate to an approximately 1 log order higher potency of FTY720-P and (R)-AFD compared with S1P at the S1P1 and S1P4 receptors (Table I) but could also be due to a different metabolic rate for the naturally occurring compound. For example, the rate of dephosphorylation of S1P, FTY720-P, and (R)-AFD, presumably proceeding either through the non-selective lipid phosphate phosphohydrolases (22Kai M. Wada I. Imai S. Sakane F. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24572-24578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) or the S1P phosphatase (30Mandala S.M. Thornton R. Galve-Roperh I. Poulton S. Peterson C. Olivera A. Bergstrom J. Kurtz M.B. Spiegel S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7859-7864Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), might be different with resultant differences in accumulation. Alternately FTY720 and (R)-AAL might be more effective substrates of the sphingosine kinase in vivo. Our discovery that FTY720 can be phosphorylated to yield a potent S1P mimetic has substantial implications for S1P biology. This pleiotropic lipid mediator is most often characterized as promoting angiogenesis, cell proliferation, and escape from apoptosis. To this list must now be added immune system modulation via changes in lymphocyte trafficking. In addition to increasing knowledge of lysophospholipid medicinal chemistry, our results reinforce the notion that sphingosine participates in a cycle of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation that governs the levels of the alcohol (sphingosine) and phosphate (S1P) forms and thus establishes the S1P tone of tissues. The ability of FTY720 to participate in this cycle to establish an exaggerated S1P tone probably underlies the high potency and efficiency of this drug. The existence of this cycle and its effect on lymphocyte trafficking might confound development of drugs that are sphingosine kinase inhibitors or S1P receptor antagonists. FTY720-P and its active analog, (R)AFD, are potent agonists at four S1P receptors, three of which (S1P1, S1P4, and S1P5) are expressed by lymphocytes. Although pertussis toxin treatment of lymphocytes ex vivodemonstrates that a G protein signaling pathway in the lymphocyte is essential for the FTY720-promoted homing response (7Henning G. Ohl L.

Feng L. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 49-52Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), S1P receptors on endothelial cells (including S1P1 and S1P3) might participate in the process also. Thus only the S1P2receptor, at which FTY720-P and (R)-AFD are inactive, is eliminated from contention. Likewise we cannot know from present data what sphingosine kinase isoform or what phosphatase isoform is relevant to the metabolism of FTY720. Additional chemical entities and genetically modified mice lacking one or more S1P receptor genes or sphingosine kinase genes are needed to define the FTY720 target(s) more precisely. An interesting finding reported recently by Hla and colleagues (21Ancellin N. Colmont C., Su, J., Li, Q. Mittereder N. Chae S.-S. Stefansson S. Liau G. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6667-6675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) is that sphingosine kinase 1a can be released from cultured cells. Although their experimental system was necessarily artificial and its prediction requires confirmation, taken at face value it suggests the intriguing notion that the phosphorylation of sphingosine might be extracellular. Since the lipid phosphate phosphohydrolases are clearly ectophosphatases (22Kai M. Wada I. Imai S. Sakane F. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24572-24578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), the entire cycle might proceed in the extracellular compartment. Such a system would provide a route whereby lysophospholipid receptors could be accessed using orally available lipid alcohol compounds as exemplified by FTY720. FTY720 is the first in a class of new immune system modulators that may allow both better management of allograft recipients and more effective treatment of patients with autoimmune disorders, which is a substantially unmet medical need. The drug is apparently less toxic than existing regimens, and in striking contrast to classical immunosuppressants, FTY720 did not impair immunity to systemic viral infection (4Pinschewer D.D. Ochsenbein A.F. Odermatt B. Brinkmann V. Hengartner H. Zinkernagel R.M. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 5761-5770Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), suggesting that treatment with FTY720 could reduce the incidence of opportunistic infections in transplant patients. The drug may even be used to treat inflammatory processes associated with chronic viral infection since in a model of viral myocarditis, FTY720 (but not cyclosporin) reduced inflammatory processes and pathology without accelerating virus replication (32Miyamoto T. Matsumori A. Hwang M.W. Nishio R. Ito H. Sasayama S. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 2001; 37: 1713-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Very encouraging is the activity of FTY720 in models of autoimmune disorders such as EAE (Fig.5), a model of human multiple sclerosis. Calcineurin inhibitors (cyclosporin and tacrolimus), which block T cell activation, are of limited use in the chronic management of such diseases. Perhaps the effects of FTY720 in EAE may relate to a direct effect on neuronal cells and/or oligodendrocytes expressing S1P receptors (33Beer M.S. Stanton J.A. Salim K. Rigby M. Heavens R.P. Smith D. McAllister G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 905: 118-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Activation of S1P receptors can antagonize apoptotic processes (21Ancellin N.

https://openalex.org/W2010378709,"Mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 confer a high risk of breast and ovarian cancer, but account for only a small fraction of breast cancer susceptibility. To find additional genes conferring susceptibility to breast cancer, we analyzed CHEK2 (also known as CHK2), which encodes a cell-cycle checkpoint kinase that is implicated in DNA repair processes involving BRCA1 and p53 (refs 3,4,5). We show that CHEK2(*)1100delC, a truncating variant that abrogates the kinase activity, has a frequency of 1.1% in healthy individuals. However, this variant is present in 5.1% of individuals with breast cancer from 718 families that do not carry mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 (P = 0.00000003), including 13.5% of individuals from families with male breast cancer (P = 0.00015). We estimate that the CHEK2(*)1100delC variant results in an approximately twofold increase of breast cancer risk in women and a tenfold increase of risk in men. By contrast, the variant confers no increased cancer risk in carriers of BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. This suggests that the biological mechanisms underlying the elevated risk of breast cancer in CHEK2 mutation carriers are already subverted in carriers of BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, which is consistent with participation of the encoded proteins in the same pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2097812689,"The 293 cell line was derived by transformation of primary cultures of human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells with sheared adenovirus (Ad)5 DNA. A combination of immunostaining, immunoblot, and microarray analysis showed that 293 cells express the neurofilament (NF) subunits NF-L, NF-M, NF-H, and a-internexin as well as many other proteins typically found in neurons. Three other independently derived HEK lines, two transformed by Ad5 and one by Ad12, also expressed NFs, as did one human embryonic retinal cell line transformed with Ad5. Two rodent kidney lines transformed with Ad12 were also found to express NF proteins, although several rodent kidney cell lines transformed by Ad5 DNA and three HEK cell lines transformed by the SV40 early region did not express NFs. These results suggest that human Ads preferentially transform human neuronal lineage cells. We also demonstrate that the widely used HEK293 cells have an unexpected relationship to neurons, a finding that may require reinterpretation of many previous studies in which it was assumed that HEK293 cells resembled more typical kidney epithelial cells."

https://openalex.org/W2069898971,"Interpretation of high-throughput biological data requires a knowledge of the design principles underlying the networks that sustain cellular functions. Of particular importance is the genetic network, a set of genes that interact through directed transcriptional regulation. Genes that exert a regulatory role encode dedicated transcription factors (hereafter referred to as regulating proteins) that can bind to specific DNA control regions of regulated genes to activate or inhibit their transcription. Regulated genes may themselves act in a regulatory manner, in which case they participate in a causal pathway. Looping pathways form feedback circuits. Because a gene can have several connections, circuits and pathways may crosslink and thus represent connected components. We have created a graph of 909 genetically or biochemically established interactions among 491 yeast genes. The number of regulating proteins per regulated gene has a narrow distribution with an exponential decay. The number of regulated genes per regulating protein has a broader distribution with a decay resembling a power law. Assuming in computer-generated graphs that gene connections fulfill these distributions but are otherwise random, the local clustering of connections and the number of short feedback circuits are largely underestimated. This deviation from randomness probably reflects functional constraints that include biosynthetic cost, response delay and differentiative and homeostatic regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2009476579,"Mutations of the gene (TNNT2) encoding the thin-filament contractile protein cardiac troponin T are responsible for 15% of all cases of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the leading cause of sudden death in young athletes. Mutant proteins are thought to act through a dominant-negative mode that impairs function of heart muscle. TNNT2 mutations can also lead to dilated cardiomyopathy, a leading cause of heart failure. Despite the importance of cardiac troponin T in human disease, its loss-of-function phenotype has not been described. We show that the zebrafish silent heart (sih) mutation affects the gene tnnt2. We characterize two mutated alleles of sih that severely reduce tnnt2 expression: one affects mRNA splicing, and the other affects gene transcription. Tnnt2, together with alpha-tropomyosin (Tpma) and cardiac troponins C and I (Tnni3), forms a calcium-sensitive regulatory complex within sarcomeres. Unexpectedly, in addition to loss of Tnnt2 expression in sih mutant hearts, we observed a significant reduction in Tpma and Tnni3, and consequently, severe sarcomere defects. This interdependence of thin-filament protein expression led us to postulate that some mutations in tnnt2 may trigger misregulation of thin-filament protein expression, resulting in sarcomere loss and myocyte disarray, the life-threatening hallmarks of TNNT2 mutations in mice and humans."

Nevertheless since the mechanism of activation of the long prodomain caspases, such as caspase-1, caspase-8, or caspase-9, is likely to be conserved, it is expected that caspase recruitment domain (CARD)1-containing adaptor molecules structurally related to Apaf-1 or the death receptor adaptor protein FADD activate caspase-1.

Similar to other members of the death domain-fold superfamily, the PYRIN domain likely mediates assembly of large signaling complexes via PYRIN-PYRIN interactions between different family members. The PYRIN domain is also found at the N terminus of the apoptosis proteins ASC and two zebrafish caspases related to mammalian caspase-1, suggesting that this domain might play a role in caspase activation (20Masumoto J. Taniguchi S. Ayukawa K. Sarvotham H. Kishino T. Niikawa N. Hidaka E. Katsuyama T. Higuchi T. Sagara J. J. Biol.

In addition to the PYRIN domain, ASC contains a C-terminal CARD, suggesting that this protein could function as an adaptor to link specific members of the PYRIN-containing proteins with CARD-containing proteins. In this report we show that ASC associates specifically with procaspase-1. This association is mediated by the CARDs of ASC and procaspase-1. Induced oligomerization of the CARD of ASC was sufficient to promote caspase-1 activation and secretion of IL-1β from transfected cells. Furthermore the isolated CARD of ASC was found to be a dominant negative inhibitor of IL-1β generation in response to LPS. Combined, our data suggest that ASC is a specific activating adaptor for caspase-1. Cells were cultured either in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (293T and Phoenix) or RPMI 1640 medium (THP-1) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 200 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. RPMI 1640 medium for THP-1 also contained 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 55 μm β-mercaptoethanol. Constructs encoding full-length ASC, DEFCAP, cryopyrin, PYPAF3 or Pyrin, or truncated mutants (PYRINs, residues 1–100) were generated by PCR using modified complementary PCR adapter primers based on the ASC, DEFCAP, cryopyrin, PYPAF3, or Pyrin cDNA sequences (GenBankTM accession numbers AB023416, NM_033004, AF464765, AF410477, and AF018080). FLAG or T7 epitope tagging was done by cloning the PCR-generated cDNAs in-frame into pFLAG CMV-2 (IBI Kodak) or pcDNA3-T7 vectors, respectively. GST tagging was done by cloning the PCR generated cDNAs together with GST cDNA in-frame into pET-21 vector (Novagen).

To assay for IL-1β secretion, THP-1 cells (1 × 106 cells/ml) were incubated for 4 h with IFNγ and then 14 h with 1 μg/ml LPS. The culture media of the cells were then used to quantify IL-1β by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). 293T cells were transfected with pro-IL-1β (0.15 μg) together with or without procaspase-1 (0.05 μg) and different amounts of ASC, Ipaf, or ASC truncated mutant expression constructs in different combinations. IL-1β secretion from transfected 293T cells was assayed 36 h after transfection as described for THP-1 cells above without stimulation with IFNγ and LPS. ASC has a dual PYRIN-CARD domain structure similar to the dual domain structures of the caspase adaptor proteins FADD and CRADD (Fig.1A). A BLAST analysis of the PYRIN domain of ASC revealed that this domain is also present at the N termini of two zebrafish caspases highly related to mammalian interleukin-1β-converting enzyme (ICE) or caspase-1 (Ref. 21Inohara N. Nunez G. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 509-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar and GenBankTM accession numbers NP_571580 and AAG45230) and several Ipaf-related proteins (Refs. 13Hlaing T.

This suggested that ASC and perhaps the Ipaf-related PYRIN-containing proteins could function as activation adaptors in the caspase-1 signaling pathway(s). To test this hypothesis we determined the ability of ectopically expressed ASC to induce activation of procaspase-1. Since IL-1β secretion is one of the consequences of caspase-1 activation, we measured the levels of IL-1β in the culture media of 293 cells that ectopically express increasing amounts of ASC together with fixed amounts of procaspase-1 and pro-IL-1β. As shown in Fig. 1B, full-length ASC was able to induce IL-1β secretion from the transfected 293 cells in a dose- and caspase-1-dependent manner. The increase in IL-1β generation was associated with a decrease in the proform of caspase-1 indicating that ASC-induced IL-1β secretion is a result of autocatalytic processing/activation of procaspase-1 (Fig.1C). Consistent with this result, ASC was unable to induce processing of the procaspase-1 C285A or IL-1β secretion in the presence of procaspase-1 C285A (Fig. 1, B and C). Interestingly the CARD-only protein pseudo-ICE/Cop (22Druilhe A. Srinivasula S.M. Razmara M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 649-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 24Lee S.H. Stehlik C. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34495-34500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), which has been previously shown to diminish IL-1β generation from THP-1 cells in response to LPS, diminished ASC-induced IL-1β secretion from 293 cells (Fig. 1B). Combined, the above results suggest that ASC is a caspase-1 activator and could be the physiological target of pseudo-ICE in THP-1 cells. Beside ASC, we have shown recently that Ipaf is another activating adaptor for caspase-1 (4Poyet J.L. Srinivasula S.M. Tnani M. Razmara M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28309-28313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). To compare the activities of ASC and Ipaf, equal amounts of ASC or the constitutively active Ipaf-557 were transiently expressed together with procaspase-1 and pro-IL-1β in 293 cells (Fig. 1D). ASC was as efficient as the constitutively active Ipaf-557 in inducing the secretion of IL-1β from the transfected 293 cells. Interestingly, when Ipaf-557 was co-expressed with the isolated CARD or PYRIN domain of ASC, the CARD, but not the PYRIN domain of ASC, was able to diminish secretion of IL-1β by Ipaf-557 (Fig. 1D). The ability of the isolated CARD of ASC to interfere with Ipaf-induced activation of caspase-1 suggests that the CARD of ASC exerts its dominant negative effect by interacting directly with either the CARD of procaspase-1 or Ipaf or both. To test this hypothesis we performedin vitro GST pull-down assays to map the interactions of ASC with procaspase-1. As shown in Fig.2A, the GST-tagged CARD of caspase-1 was able to bind to in vitro translated ASC and its isolated CARD but not its PYRIN domain, indicating that the CARD of procaspase-1 interacts with ASC via CARD-CARD interactions (Fig.2A). Similar results were obtained when a GST-tagged CARD of ASC was incubated with in vitro translated procaspase-1; the GST-CARD of ASC was able to bind full-length procaspase-1 (Fig.2B), indicating that the interaction between ASC and procaspase-1 is mediated by the CARDs of the two proteins. These results were confirmed by immunoprecipitation experiments in 293 cells transfected with FLAG-tagged ASC, ASC-CARD, or ASC-PYRIN and T7-tagged procaspase-1. ASC and ASC-CARD, but not ASC-PYRIN, were able to immunoprecipitate procaspase-1 (Fig. 2C), thus confirming that ASC can indeed interact via CARD-CARD interactions with procaspase-1. The GST-CARD of procaspase-1 was also able to bind to the endogenous ASC protein of the THP-1 monocytic cell line, providing additional evidence that ASC interacts specifically with procaspase-1 (Fig. 2D). No interactions were observed between ASC and the CARDs of the caspase-1-related caspase-4 and -5 (not shown), indicating that the interactions between the CARD of caspase-1 and ASC is very specific. GST pull-down experiments with a GST-tagged CARD of Ipaf revealed that ASC could also interact with the CARD of Ipaf (Fig.2E). This and the above observations that ASC interacts via CARD-CARD interactions with procaspase-1 explain the dominant negative effect of the isolated CARD of ASC on Ipaf-mediated caspase-1 activation. Furthermore, consistent with the ability of pseudo-ICE to inhibit ASC-induced caspase-1 activation (Fig. 1B), GST-tagged pseudo-ICE was able to interact strongly with full-length ASC and its CARD (Fig.3E). The initiator caspases, such as caspase-8 or caspase-9, are activated by an induced proximity mechanism involving oligomerization by an adaptor molecule such as FADD or Apaf-1, respectively (25Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10964-10967Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). In the case of FADD, its N-terminal death effector domain interacts with procaspase-8 and acts as the effector domain, while its C-terminal death domain, which interacts with death receptors, functions as the oligomerization domain. The dual domain structure of ASC and its ability to interact through the CARD with procaspase-1 suggests that ASC, like FADD, functions as an adaptor molecule. The CARD of ASC functions as the effector domain, while the PYRIN domain functions as the oligomerization domain. To test this hypothesis we fused the isolated PYRIN and CARD of ASC to an inducible FKBP12 oligomerization cassette (Fig. 3A). We then expressed the fusion proteins in 293T cells together with procaspase-1 and pro-IL-1β and treated the cells with the oligomerization drug AP20187 (ARIAD Pharmaceuticals). Treatment of the FKp3-CARD-expressing cells with AP20187 resulted in an 8-fold increase in IL-1β secretion compared with the untreated control (Fig. 3B). This increase in IL-1β secretion was diminished ∼50% by the caspase-1 dominant negative protein pseudo-ICE, a result consistent with the findings that pseudo-ICE binds to the CARD of ASC and interferes with its ability to activate procaspase-1. No IL-1β secretion was observed in FKp3-PYRIN-expressing cells after treatment with AP20187. Taken together these results indicate that the CARD is the effector domain of ASC and that the role of the PYRIN domain is to regulate the oligomerization status of the CARD by upstream signaling molecules in this caspase-1 activation pathway. Finally to test whether ASC is a critical component in the caspase-1 signaling pathway in THP-1 cells, we generated stable THP-1 cell lines that express the isolated CARD or PYRIN domains of ASC. To determine the effect of these domains on the caspase-1 signaling pathway we assayed IL-1β generation in response to IFNγ and LPS stimulation. As expected, the CARD of ASC reduced IL-1β secretion by ∼50% compared with control vector-transfected cells. The dominant negative effect of the CARD of ASC is likely due to its ability to bind to caspase-1 and interfere with its activation and/or activity. Consistent with this, the stably transfected ASC-CARD, but not the PYRIN domain, was able to immunoprecipitate the endogenous caspase-1 from the THP-1 cells (Fig. 3D). Interestingly the PYRIN domain of ASC increased IL-1β secretion by 2-fold. This effect might be attributed to PYRIN-PYRIN interactions between the isolated PYRIN domain of ASC and endogenous ASC, which may enhance oligomerization of endogenous ASC and activation of caspase-1. Pyrin, cryopyrin/PYPAF1, PYPAF3, and DEFCAP/NAC contain N-terminal PYRIN domains (13Hlaing T. Guo R.F. Dilley K.A. Loussia J.M. Morrish T.A. Shi M.M. Vincenz C. Ward P.A. J. Biol.

Pyrin and cryopyrin/PYPAF1 have been shown to form cytosolic speck-like structures with ASC when overexpressed together in transfected HeLa or 293 cells (16Manji G.A. Wang L. Geddes B.J. Brown M. Merriam S., Al- Garawi A. Mak S. Lora J.M. Briskin M. Jurman M. Cao J. DiStefano P.S. Bertin J. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 39320-39329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The formation of these structures is thought to be mediated by PYRIN-PYRIN interactions. To test whether the PYRIN domain of these proteins interacts with ASC we performed GST pull-down experiments (Fig. 4, A and B). Unlike the strong interaction observed between in vitro translated full-length ASC and the GST-CARD of procaspase-1, no significant interactions were observed between full-length ASC and the GST-tagged PYRIN domains of Pyrin, cryopyrin/PYPAF1, PYPAF3, or DEFCAP/NAC under these conditions (Fig. 4A). However, a weak interaction was seen between full-length ASC and the GST-tagged PYRIN domain of ASC. Similarly, under the same conditions in which a detectable interaction can be seen between 35S-labeled procaspase-1 and GST-ASC, no significant interactions were seen betweenin vitro translated full-length Pyrin, cryopyrin/PYPAF1, PYPAF3, or DEFCAP/NAC and GST-tagged ASC or ASC-PYRIN (Fig.4B). Furthermore no significant interactions were detected by co-immunoprecipitation experiments with overexpressed full-length proteins in transfected 293 cells, although the overexpressed proteins were readily detectable in the total extracts of transfected cells (data not shown). These observations indicate that ASC does not form stable complexes with Pyrin, cryopyrin/PYPAF1, PYPAF3, or DEFCAP/NAC via PYRIN-PYRIN interactions. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that ASC might interact transiently with these proteins in a stimulus-dependent manner under physiological circumstances. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that ASC is a specific procaspase-1 binding partner. Interaction of ASC with procaspase-1 in transfected cells induces its activation and results in processing of pro-IL-1β and secretion of mature IL-1β. The CARD of ASC represents its effector domain, which recruits procaspase-1 and induces its activation by an induced proximity mechanism. Consistent with this, enforced oligomerization of the CARD of ASC causes activation of procaspase-1 and secretion of IL-1β. Furthermore the isolated CARD of ASC is a dominant negative inhibitor of IL-1β secretion in response to LPS stimulation of THP-1 cells. Finally we hypothesize that the PYRIN domain of ASC represents its oligomerization domain, which likely interacts with upstream effectors of the caspase-1 signaling pathway in response to stimulation with proinflammatory cytokines. However, the upstream interactors that bind to the PYRIN domain of ASC remain unknown at present."
https://openalex.org/W1991926550,"We conducted two event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments to investigate the neural substrates of visual object recognition in humans. We used a repetition-priming method with visual stimuli recurring at unpredictable intervals, either with the same appearance or with changes in size, viewpoint or exemplar. Lateral occipital and posterior inferior temporal cortex showed lower activity for repetitions of both real and non-sense objects; fusiform and left inferior frontal regions showed decreases for repetitions of only real objects. Repetition of different exemplars with the same name affected only the left inferior frontal cortex. Crucially, priming-induced decreases in activity of the right fusiform cortex depended on whether the three-dimensional objects were repeated with the same viewpoint, regardless of whether retinal image size changed; left fusiform decreases were independent of both viewpoint and size. These data show that dissociable subsystems in ventral visual cortex maintain distinct view-dependent and view-invariant object representations."

The AGPAT2 enzyme catalyzes the acylation of lysophosphatidic acid to form phosphatidic acid, a key intermediate in the biosynthesis of triacylglycerol and glycerophospholipids. AGPAT2 mRNA is highly expressed in adipose tissue. We conclude that mutations in AGPAT2 may cause congenital generalized lipodystrophy by inhibiting triacylglycerol synthesis and storage in adipocytes."

This study investigates the hypothesis that winding of connective tissue, rather than muscle contraction, is the mechanism responsible for needle grasp. We performed 1) measurements of pullout force in humans with and without needle penetration of muscle; 2) measurements of pullout force in anesthetized rats, with and without needle rotation, followed by measurements of connective tissue volume surrounding the needle; 3) imaging of rat abdominal wall explants, with and without needle rotation, using ultrasound scanning acoustic microscopy. We found 1) no evidence that increased penetration of muscle results in greater pullout force than increased penetration of subcutaneous tissue; 2) that both pullout force and subcutaneous tissue volume were increased by needle rotation; 3) that increased periodic architectural order was present in subcutaneous tissue with rotation, compared with no rotation. These data support connective tissue winding as the mechanism responsible for the increase in pullout force induced by needle rotation. Winding may allow needle movements to deliver a mechanical signal into the tissue and may be key to acupuncture's therapeutic mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2027655271,"It has been 30 years since it was first proposed that the vertebrate genome evolved through several rounds of genome-wide duplications (polyploidizations)1. Despite rapid advances in genetics, including sequencing of the complete genomes of several divergent species, this hypothesis has not been tested rigorously and is still a matter of debate2. If polyploidizations occurred during chordate evolution, there should be a network of paralogous regions in the present-day jawed vertebrate (Gnathostomata) genomes3. Here we present an investigation of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) paralogous regions, which we accomplished by characterizing the corresponding region in amphioxus by identifying nine anchor genes and sequencing both the anchor genes and the regions that flank them (a total of 400 kb). Phylogenetic analysis of 31 genes (including the anchor genes) in these regions shows that duplications occurred after the divergence of cephalochordates and vertebrates but before the Gnathostomata radiation. The distribution of human and amphioxus orthologs in their respective genomes and the relationship between these distributions support the en bloc duplication events. Our analysis represents the first step towards demonstrating that the human ancestral genome has undergone polyploidization. Moreover, reconstruction of the pre-duplicated region indicates that one of the duplicated regions retains the ancestral organization."
https://openalex.org/W2113467168,"Genetic, neuropathological, and biochemical studies have provided strong evidence for a central role of amyloid in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We have proposed previously that peptides designed as beta-sheet breakers may be useful in preventing the formation of amyloid plaques. In this study, we describe a modified beta-sheet breaker peptide with improved pharmacological properties, a high rate of penetration across the blood-brain barrier, and the ability to induce a dramatic reduction in amyloid deposition in two different transgenic AD models. In addition, we report for the first time a significant increase in neuronal survival and a decrease in brain inflammation associated with the reduction of amyloid plaques. These results demonstrate that the process of amyloid deposition is one of the causes of neurodegeneration in AD. Moreover, our findings indicate that beta-sheet breaker peptides provide a valuable tool for evaluating further the importance of amyloid in the etiology of AD and suggest that these peptides or some of their derivatives might be good candidates for AD treatment."

https://openalex.org/W2170895173,"Directed cell migration is essential for tissue formation, inflammation, and wound healing. Chemotaxis plays a major role in these situations and is underpinned by asymmetric intracellular signaling. Endogenous electric fields (EFs) are common where cell movement occurs, such as in wound healing, and cells respond to electric field gradients by reorienting and migrating directionally (galvanotaxis/electrotaxis). We show that a physiological EF redistributed both EGF (epidermal growth factor) receptors and detergent-insoluble membrane lipids asymmetrically, leading to cathodal polarization and enhanced activation of the MAP kinase, ERK1/2. This induced leading-edge actin polymerization in directionally migrating mammalian epithelial cells. Inhibiting the EGF receptor-MAP kinase signaling pathway significantly decreased leading edge actin asymmetry and directional migration. We propose a model in which EF-polarized membrane lipid domains and EGF receptors cause asymmetric signaling through MAP kinase, which drives directional cell migration. A comparison is made with the mechanisms underpinning chemotaxis."
https://openalex.org/W2113194569,"The mechanism of disease-associated trinucleotide repeat instability involves cis-acting factors (cis-elements) in the vicinity of the repeat, but the nature of these elements is unknown. One cis-element may be the location of the replication origin relative to the repeat. We have used an SV40 DNA replication system to investigate the effect of the location of replication initiation on (CTG)n•(CAG)n stability in primate cells. Depending on the distance between the SV40 replication origin and the repeat tract, templates with 79 repeats yield predominantly expansions or predominantly deletions or remain intact. All templates with 17 repeats are stable. Thus, cis-elements that affect the sites of Okazaki fragment initiation relative to the repeat are crucial determinants of instability. This model system recapitulates the bias for expansions observed in many of the diseases associated with trinucleotide repeats. Our results might explain the variable amounts of CTG/CAG instability that are observed in different chromosomal contexts."

KATP channels are expressed in high density in metabolically active tissues, in particular heart muscle, where the pore-forming Kir6.2 protein assembles with the regulatory sulfonylurea receptor SUR2A subunit to form functional hetero-octameric complexes (21Inagaki N.

In this regard, active membrane ATPases constantly reduce the local ATP concentration setting the submembrane ATP/ADP ratio distinct from that of the “bulk” cytosol (15Weiss J.N. Korge P. Circ.

Science. 1990; 248: 283Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) would hamper proper recognition of cellular signals rendering KATP channels ineffective metabolic sensors. In response to metabolic alterations, the membrane content of polyphosphoinositides has been implicated in defining the ATP-sensitivity of cardiac KATP channels (32Shyng S.L. Nichols C.G. Science. 1998; 282: 1138-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Yet, altered KATP channel sensitivity per se may not provide an efficient mechanism of metabolic signal transduction as drastic reduction in the channel responsiveness to ATP, induced by mutation of Kir6.2, has no apparent consequences on channel behavior and/or membrane electrical activity in metabolically competent cardiac cells (33Koster J.C. Knopp A. Flagg T.P. Markova K.P. Sha Q. Enkvetchakul D. Betsuyaku T. Yamada K.A. Nichols C.G. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 1022-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Rather, coordination of membrane sensor function with the cellular metabolic status mandates effective transfer of energetic signals between intracellular compartments (2O'Rourke B. Ramza B.M. Marban E. Science. 1994; 265: 962-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 15Weiss J.N. Korge P. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 108-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Cells with high and fluctuating energy demands, such as cardiomyocytes, possess catalyzed phosphotransfer circuits that facilitate energetic signaling between sites of ATP production and utilization (3Dzeja P.P.

Emerging evidence suggests that phosphotransfer networks can process metabolic information for delivery to metabolic sensors, thereby serving a critical role in cellular homeostasis (2O'Rourke B.

In this way, the phosphotransfer enzyme adenylate kinase physically associates with KATP channel proteins to facilitate communication of mitochondrial signals and promote channel opening in stress (34Carassco A.J. Dzeja P.P. Alekseev A.E. Pucar D. Zingman L.V. Abraham M.R. Hodgson D. Bienengraeber M. Puceat M. Janssen E. Wieringa B. Terzic A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7623-7628Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). A related signal delivery function has been suggested for the most active phosphotransfer enzyme in the myocardium, creatine kinase, which could control KATP channel closure and prevent accidental channel opening (3Dzeja P.P.

Isoforms of creatine kinase are found in distinct intracellular compartments, including membranes where KATPchannels reside (13Kaasik A. Veksler V. Boehm E. Novotova M. Minajeva A. Ventura-Clapier R.

Substrates of creatine kinase regulate nucleotide-dependent KATP channel gating and can overcome potassium channel opener-induced channel activation (36Bienengraeber M. Alekseev A.E. Abraham M.R.

In fact, in opener-primed cardiomyocytes inhibition of creatine kinase reduces the effect of mitochondrial uncoupling on KATP channel activity (40Sasaki N. Sato T. Marban E. O'Rourke B. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: H1882-H1888Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although an intimate relationship between phosphotransfer enzymes and the channel itself has been suggested (3Dzeja P.P. Terzic A.

FASEB J. 2002; 16: 102-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), the requirement for creatine kinase phosphotransfer in synchronizing metabolic sensor function in response to fluctuations in the cellular metabolic state has not been defined. Here, we demonstrate that the dynamics of high energy phosphoryl transfer through the creatine kinase system coordinates KATP channel activity with cellular metabolism contributing to an integrative mechanism for delivery of energetic signals to the membrane sensor. Deletion of the M-CK gene, which encodes the major creatine kinase isoform, disrupted creatine kinase-dependent signal delivery to KATPchannels and generated a phenotype with increased electrical vulnerability. Mice lacking the M-creatine kinase (M-CK)1 isoform were derived from embryonic stem cells carrying a replacement mutation in the M-CK gene (1van Deursen J. Heerschap A. Oerlemans F. Ruitenbeek W. Jap P. ter Laak H. Wieringa B. Cell. 1993; 74: 621-631Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Inactivation of M-CK expression was achieved by homologous DNA recombination with a HygroB cassette vector used to replace exon 2 and parts of introns 1 and 2 in theM-CK gene. Homozygous M-CK-knock-out mice were compared with age-matched wild-type controls. Cardiomyocytes, isolated from wild-type and M-CK knock-out mice or guinea pig ventricles (34Carassco A.J. Dzeja P.P.

Patch electrodes (7–10 MΩ) were filled with (mm) KCl, 140; CaCl2, 1; MgCl2, 1; HEPES-KOH, 5 (pH 7.3). For the open cell-attached patch, bath solution was supplemented with glucose (1 g/liter), malic acid (5 mm), and pyruvic acid (5 mm). Following seal formation with the patch pipette, cell permeabilization was achieved by digitonin (5–8 μg/ml) applied through a second pipette (filled with 5 μg/ml propidium iodide and 0.5 μg/ml rhodamine). Under ultraviolet light, rhodamine served for visualization of solution flow, and propidium iodide staining of the cell nucleus indicated formation of the open cell-attached patch configuration (36Bienengraeber M.

Monophasic action potentials were recorded from the left ventricular epicardial surface using a probe (EP Technologies) while pacing at 130-ms cycle length and 10-ms pulse width (Accupulser, World Precision Instruments). In guinea pig hearts, action potentials were measured without pacing. Nucleotide-dependent KATP channel gating was simulated by an allosteric model where four identical binding sites for ATP and ADP co-exist within the octameric stoichiometry of the KATP channel complex (16Ashcroft F.M.

Distribution of channel species (D i ; i = 0 to 4) with 0–4 ADP bound molecules was as follows, D1D0=4·[ADP]kADP;D2D1=3·[ADP]2kADP;D3D2=2·[ADP]3kADP;D4D3=[ADP]4kADP;∑j=14Dj=1Equation 1 with the percentage of D i species expressed as a function of ADP concentration,D1=4·D0[ADP]kADP;D2=6·D0[ADP]kADP2;D3=4·D0[ADP]kADP3;Equation 2 D4=D0[ADP]kADP4whereD0=1+4·[ADP]kADP+6·[ADP]kADP2+4·[ADP]kADP3+[ADP]kADP4−1Equation 3 and k ADP the dissociation constant of ADP from SUR, independent from ATP binding. Analogously to EquationsEquation 1, Equation 2, Equation 3, the distribution of channel species (T i ) with 0–4 ATP bound molecules was derived as follows,∑i=14TiDj=Dj,j=0–4Equation 4 with k 0 andk 1 representing dissociation constants for ATP binding to Kir6.2 in the absence and presence of ADP at the associated SUR (Fig. 1, A and B). The best fits of experimental data from ATP-induced KATP channel inhibition in the absence of ADP, at saturating ADP and at below saturating ADP revealed, respectively, the values for k 0,k 1, and k ADP, with more than one ATP required to close the channel octamer. Diffusional restriction was estimated by integrating membrane ATPase activities and diffusional nucleotide fluxes (Fig.1 C). Membrane ATP consumption (J ATPase) was simulated as a Michaelis-Menten reaction with the Michaelis constant at 0.05 mm (45Chazov E.I. Smirnov V.N. Saks V.A. Rosenshtraukh L.V. Lipina N.V.

Sarcolemmal ATPase activity (1,800 nmol/min/g wet weight) was derived from total ATPase activity in working hearts measured by18O-assisted 31P NMR (300 nmol/min/mg of protein), assuming that 120 mg of protein (with 1 mg of sarcolemmal protein) is contained in 1 g of tissue and that ∼5% of total energy is consumed by sarcolemmal ATPases (46Golhaber J.I. Langer G.A. The Myocardium. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1997: 325-383Crossref Google Scholar). Nucleotide diffusion (with a coefficient D) was calculated according to Fick's law as one-dimensional flux (through total cell area in 1 g of tissue, S) perpendicular to the membrane. Diffusional flux for ATP was as follows, JATPdiff(x)=−DS∂[ATP(x)]∂xEquation 5 where J ATP(x) is ATP flux at distance x. At steady-state, withJ ATP constant, C = −DS/Δxdefining,JATPdiff=C([ATP]b−[ATP]sub)Equation 6 where [ATP]b and [ATP]sub are cytosolic bulk and subsarcolemmal ATP concentration, respectively. Diffusional flux for ADP was described analogously as in Equation 6. [ATP]sub and [ADP]sub, as a function of [ATP]b (Fig. 1 D), were defined from the following equation.C([ATP]b−[ATP]sub)−JATPase=0C([ADP]b−[ADP]sub)+JATPase=0Equation 7 The defining property of cardiac KATP channels as membrane metabolic sensors is their overt inhibition by ATP, which can be antagonized by MgADP (Fig. 1 A). KATP channels adopt their highest sensitivity to ATP in the absence of MgADP and convert to a range of lower ATP sensitivities with increasing concentrations of MgADP (Fig. 1 A).

Allosteric modeling, which integrated KATP channel stoichiometry and channel-nucleotide interactions (Fig. 1 B), demonstrated that on saturating ADP-binding sites (at >100 μm ADP) no further reduction in ATP sensitivity can be achieved (Fig. 1, A andB), in accord with the efficacy of ADP to antagonize ATP-induced channel inhibition (47Weiss J.N.

The details of the interaction between Pex5p and PTS1 have been resolved by an extensive mutational analysis of Pex5p (24Klein A.T. Barnett P. Bottger G. Konings D. Tabak H.F. Distel B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15034-15041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and determination of the crystal structure of a Pex5p-PTS1 peptide complex (25Gatto G.J., Jr. Geisbrecht B.V. Gould S.J. Berg J.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1091-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Those studies revealed that the TPR domain of Pex5p forms two clusters of three TPR motifs that are close together in space and form a single binding site for the PTS1. Amino acids from both TPR clusters are interacting with the PTS1 peptide backbone and with the amino acid side chains. How binding of PTS2 by Pex7p, a WD-40 repeat protein, takes place is still unclear. The receptor-cargo complex docks on the peroxisome via the interaction with a protein complex located in the peroxisomal membrane. Although some of the details vary between different species, it has been shown that Pex13p, Pex14p, and Pex17p are part of this docking complex (26–41). Proteins implicated in the translocation over the peroxisomal membrane are Pex2p, Pex10p, and Pex12p (15Dodt G. Gould S.J. J.

Cell Biol. 2001; 80: 126-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The first PTS1 identified was that of firefly luciferase and consists of the carboxyl-terminal tripeptide SKL (1Gould S.J. Keller G.A. Hosken N. Wilkinson J. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1657-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar,51Gould S.J. Keller G.A. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2923-2931Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). This tripeptide proved not only essential for the import of luciferase but was also shown to be sufficient to direct other proteins to peroxisomes (1Gould S.J. Keller G.A. Hosken N. Wilkinson J. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1657-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar, 2Swinkels B.W. Gould S.J. Subramani S.

EMBO J. 1990; 9: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). However, a number of observations (1Gould S.J. Keller G.A. Hosken N. Wilkinson J. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1657-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar,54Motley A. Lumb M.J. Oatey P.B. Jennings P.R., De Zoysa P.A. Wanders R.J. Tabak H.F. Danpure C.J. J.

Cell. 1992; 3: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) suggest that the definition of a PTS1 as being both necessary and sufficient for the import of proteins into peroxisomes needs some adjustment. These studies have shown that whether or not a carboxyl-terminal tripeptide can function as a PTS1 depends on its context. For instance, targeting of alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase I to peroxisomes in humans depends on the carboxyl-terminal tripeptide KKL (54Motley A. Lumb M.J. Oatey P.B. Jennings P.R., De Zoysa P.A. Wanders R.J. Tabak H.F. Danpure C.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 95-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, this carboxyl-terminal KKL was not sufficient to direct the reporter protein luciferase to peroxisomes in human fibroblasts (54Motley A. Lumb M.J. Oatey P.B. Jennings P.R., De Zoysa P.A. Wanders R.J. Tabak H.F. Danpure C.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 95-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and in monkey kidney CV-1 cells (1Gould S.J. Keller G.A. Hosken N. Wilkinson J. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1657-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar) or to glycosomes in Trypanosoma brucei(55Sommer J.M. Cheng Q.L. Keller G.A. Wang C.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). For peroxisomal malate dehydrogenase (Mdh3p), it was also shown that in the homologous context many variations that do not comply with the consensus sequence could still direct this protein to peroxisomes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (46Elgersma Y. Vos A. van den Berg M. van Roermund C.W. van der Sluijs P. Distel B. Tabak H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26375-26382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). These results can be explained by the presence of accessory sequences in a peroxisomal matrix protein that, when this protein is presented in its homologous context, contribute to the binding of the PTS1-containing protein to Pex5p. These accessory sequences can sometimes be located close to the PTS1 and can influence the binding to Pex5p in a species-dependent manner, as was shown for hexadecapeptides containing a PTS1 (56Lametschwandtner G. Brocard C. Fransen M. Van Veldhoven P. Berger J. Hartig A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33635-33643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In other cases a PTS1 is not essential at all. This is most evident for carnitine acetyltransferase (Cat2p); its targeting to peroxisomes in S. cerevisiae is Pex5p-dependent, but after deletion of the PTS1 most of the carnitine acetyltransferase is still directed to peroxisomes (57Elgersma Y. van Roermund C.W. Wanders R.J. Tabak H.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3472-3479Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Deletion of the PTS1 in Cat2p also does not affect its interaction with Pex5p in the two-hybrid system. These results suggest that in some cases accessory or alternative sequences can be used for binding to Pex5p and that these can function as a targeting signal. Import of proteins in a PTS1- or PTS2-independent way can be explained in various ways. In genetically constructed S. cerevisiae strains import into peroxisomes can take place by formation of homo-oligomers between subunits without a PTS and subunits with a PTS (43Glover J.R.

Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 185-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Similarly, it has been shown that S. cerevisiae Δ3,Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase (Eci1p) can hetero-oligomerize with Δ3,5-Δ2,4-dienoyl-CoA isomerase (Dci1p) resulting in the import of Eci1p from which the PTS1 had been deleted (50Yang X. Purdue P.E. Lazarow P.B. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 80: 126-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In a natural context, there are several peroxisomal matrix proteins that are not equipped with a recognizable PTS1 or PTS2. Examples of such proteins are Hansenula polymorpha malate synthase (58Bruinenberg P.G. Blaauw M. Kazemier B. Ab G. Yeast. 1990; 6: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and acyl-CoA oxidases of the yeasts Candida tropicalis (59Small G.M. Szabo L.J. Lazarow P.B. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1167-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), Candida maltosa (60Hill D.E. Boulay R. Rogers D.

Yeast. 1998; 14: 1373-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). How targeting of these proteins to peroxisomes takes place, via piggy-backing or via alternative targeting sequences in these proteins, is not known (59Small G.M. Szabo L.J. Lazarow P.B.

Yeast. 1999; 15: 1035-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) acyl-CoA oxidase is imported via its PTS1. Here we show that S. cerevisiae acyl-CoA oxidase (Pox1p) binds directly to Pex5p and that binding is not dependent on the carboxyl-terminal 17 amino acids of Pox1p. By using a pex5mutant that is specifically disturbed in the interaction with and the import of PTS1 proteins, we show that S. cerevisiae Pox1p is imported into peroxisomes in a PTS1-independent manner. The site of Pox1p interaction on Pex5p was identified and shown to be located in a region outside of the TPR domain. A pex5 mutant containing a Y253N substitution within the Pox1p-binding region is specifically disturbed in the interaction with and the import of Pox1p. These results demonstrate a novel, non-PTS1-mediated import route for Pox1p that is dependent on Pex5p.

Cell culture conditions are as follows: cells were pre-grown overnight on minimal 0.3% glucose medium (0.3% glucose, 0.67% yeast nitrogen base (YNB; Difco) and amino acids (20–30 μg/ml) as required). These cultures were inoculated in fresh 0.3% glucose medium and further grown to log phase. For induction on oleate these cultures were inoculated 1:10 in fresh oleate medium (0.5% potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, 0.5% peptone and 0.3% yeast extract, 0.1% oleate, 2% Tween 40) and grown overnight at 28 °C. Standard techniques for DNA manipulations were used (69Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed.

The PCR product was cloned in pGEM-T (Promega) without A-tailing, generating pAN74, which was used as template in a second PCR with primers pr34 and pr52. This PCR product was cloned SalI-SpeI in pPC97 (71Chevray P.M. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

For the construction of pAN87, encoding a MBP fusion with ΔN-Cat2-ΔC, theSacI-HindIII fragment of pEL99 (57Elgersma Y. van Roermund C.W. Wanders R.J. Tabak H.F.

For introducing single amino acid substitutions, the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used. The oligonucleotides pr64 and pr65 were used for introducing the D262G substitution, and pr62 and pr63 were used for introducing the I264T substitution (see Table I).Table IPrimer compositions Open table in a new tab Subcellular fractionation experiments were performed as described previously (39Bottger G.

Protease protection was performed on oleate-grown cells (200 OD units) that were spheroplasted and lysed in hypotonic buffer similar as described for the preparation of homogenates for subcellular fractionation. 20 μg of proteinase K (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added to 50 μg of protein sample and incubated with or without Triton X-100 (final concentration 0.15%) at room temperature for 5, 10, 15, and 30 min. Protease activity was stopped by addition of an equal volume of 20% trichloroacetic acid, and proteins were precipitated on ice for a minimum of 1 h. Samples were centrifuged for 30 min at 20,000 × g, and pellets were washed with acetone and resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer (69Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T.

Secondary antibodies used were goat anti-rabbit Ig-conjugated alkaline phosphatase or goat anti-mouse Ig-conjugated alkaline phosphatase. Thepex5 mutant library and the screening procedure forpex5 mutants have been described before (24Klein A.T. Barnett P. Bottger G. Konings D. Tabak H.F. Distel B. J. Biol.

Candida albicans sequences homologous to S. cerevisiae Pex5p and Pox1p were retrieved from the Stanford Genome Technology Center by performing a blast search with these proteins at sequence-www.stanford.edu/group/candida. Contig6–2210 and contig6–2346 contain the C. albicans sequences homologous to S. cerevisiae Pox1p and Pex5p, respectively. S. cerevisiae Pox1p does not contain any recognizable peroxisomal targeting sequence. It is therefore unclear how this protein is imported into the peroxisomal matrix and whether it uses one of the known import receptors, Pex5p or Pex7p. To investigate this we examined the targeting of Pox1p to peroxisomes in wild type, pex5Δ, and pex7Δ cells. Cells were homogenized, and a post-nuclear supernatant was centrifuged at 17,500 ×g. Equivalent volumes of the organellar pellet and the supernatant fractions were analyzed by Western blotting with antibodies specific for Pox1p, the NH tag to detect NH-Mdh3p (a PTS1 protein expressed from a co-transformed plasmid) and 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (a PTS2 protein) (Fig. 1 A). The distribution of catalase A (a PTS1 protein) was determined by measuring the enzyme activity (Fig. 1 B). In wild type cells Pox1p, catalase A, NH-Mdh3p, and thiolase were located in the pellet fraction, indicating that each of these proteins was targeted to peroxisomes. Inpex5Δ cells Pox1p, catalase A and NH-Mdh3p were mislocalized to the supernatant fraction indicating that peroxisomal targeting of Pox1p, like the PTS1 proteins catalase A and NH-Mdh3p, is dependent on Pex5p. Although a significant fraction of NH-Mdh3p was recovered in the organellar pellet, this does not represent peroxisomal import (see below). The localization of the PTS2 protein thiolase was not affected in pex"
https://openalex.org/W2010329320,"We have investigated the influence of substrate binding on the zinc ion affinity of representatives from the three metallo-β-lactamase subclasses, B1 (BcII from Bacillus cereus and BlaB from Chryseobacterium meningosepticum), B2 (CphA from Aeromonas hydrophila), and B3 (L1 from Stenotrophomonas maltophilia). By competition experiments with metal-free apoenzymes and chromophoric zinc chelators or EDTA, we determined the dissociation constants in the absence and presence of substrates. For the formation of the monozinc enzymes we determined constants of 1.8, 5.1, 0.007, and 2.6 nm in the absence and 13.6, 1.8, 1.2, and 5.7 pm in the presence of substrates for BcII, BlaB, CphA, and L1, respectively. A second zinc ion binds in the absence (presence) of substrates with considerably higher dissociation constants, namely 1.8 (0.8), 0.007 (0.025), 50 (1.9), and 0.006 (0.12) μm for BcII, BlaB, CphA, and L1, respectively. We have concluded that the apo form might be the prevailing state of most of the metallo-β-lactamases under physiological conditions in the absence of substrates. Substrate availability induces a spontaneous self-activation due to a drastic decrease of the dissociation constants, resulting in the formation of active mononuclear enzymes already at picomolar free zinc ion concentrations. In the presence of substrates, the binuclear state of the enzymes only exists at unphysiologic high zinc concentrations and might be of no biological relevance. From the competition experiments with EDTA it is further concluded that the reactivation rate does not depend on the pool of free zinc ions but proceeds via the EDTA-Zn(II)-enzyme ternary complexes.

All known representatives possess two conserved metal binding sites and require zinc ions as enzymatic cofactors. By catalyzing the hydrolysis of β-lactams they render the corresponding strains resistant to almost all β-lactam antibiotics. Their increasing emergence in pathogenic bacterial strains due to a rapid dissemination by horizontal gene transfer has induced a growing interest in this enzyme family because of the lack of efficient therapies to treat infected patients. The metallo-β-lactamases constitute a group of heterogeneous proteins that is divided into subclasses B1, B2, and B3 (1Rasmussen B.A. Bush K. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1997; 41: 223-232Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subclass B1 exhibits a broad substrate profile (2Felici A. Amicosante G. Oratore A. Strom R. Ledent P. Joris B. Fanuael L. Frère J.-M. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), and its zinc binding sites are composed of His-116, His-118, and His-196 (site 1) and Asp-120, Cys-221, and His-263 (site 2) (numbering according to Ref. 3Galleni M.

In subclass B2 the zinc ligands in site 2 are conserved, whereas His-116 in site 1 is replaced by Asn. Representatives of subclass B2 efficiently hydrolyze only carbapenems (2Felici A. Amicosante G. Oratore A. Strom R. Ledent P. Joris B. Fanuael L. Frère J.-M. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and are active as monozinc enzymes, whereas the binding of a second zinc ion causes non-competitive inhibition (4Hernandez Valladares M.

In subclass B3, Cys-221 is substituted by a Ser and is replaced by His-121 as a zinc ligand in site 2. In the Gob-1 enzyme (Chryseobacterium meningosepticum PINT) an additional His-116 → Gln mutation has been reported. Subclass B3 enzymes exhibit a broad spectrum activity profile with a putative preference for cephalosporins (5Boschi L. Mercuri P.S. Riccio M.L. Amicosante G. Galleni M. Frère J.M. Rossolini G.M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 1538-1543Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The question as to whether zinc-β-lactamases are active as the mono- or the dizinc enzyme has been controversially discussed, and two alternative mechanisms for both enzyme states have been proposed (6Bounaga S.

Biol. 1999; 3: 614-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The known dissociation constants of class B β-lactamases for the formation of monozinc enzymes range from 6 pm for CphA1 (8Hernandez Valladares M. Kiefer M. Heinz U. Paul-Soto R. Meyer-Klaucke W.

A second zinc ion is bound with dissociation constants in the micromolar range (8Hernandez Valladares M. Kiefer M. Heinz U. Paul-Soto R. Meyer-Klaucke W. Nolting H.F. Zeppezauer M. Galleni M.

In particular, the low affinity for a second zinc ion leads to the question of whether or not physiological conditions offer sufficiently high metal ion concentrations to maintain the active metal-bound state of the enzymes. Recently, it was shown that the available concentration of free zinc ions in eukaryotic cells is controlled by the metallothionein/thionein pair (11Yang Y. Maret W. Vallee B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5556-5559Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The presence of free thionein in different cell types (11Yang Y. Maret W. Vallee B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5556-5559Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) combined with the picomolar dissociation constant of metallothionein (12Otvos J.D. Petering D.H. Shaw C.F. Comments Inorg. Chem. 1989; 9: 1-35Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar) implicate free zinc ion concentrations in the picomolar range. A regulation system involving metalloregulatory proteins was recently evidenced in bacteria (13Outten C.E. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 2001; 292: 2488-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar), resulting in estimated femtomolar concentrations of free cytosolic zinc. For the operational area of metallo-β-lactamases (periplasm or the extracellular environment of bacteria) similarly low concentrations of free zinc might be assumed because of the strong competition of various bacterial proteins for the metal ions, especially under conditions of bacterial growth. Physiological conditions would therefore not fulfill the requirements for a metal-bound enzyme state. A first indication of a substrate-modified affinity for zinc ions resulted from a study (14Paul-Soto R. Bauer R. Frère J.M. Galleni M. Meyer-Klaucke W. Nolting H. Rossolini G.M. DeSeny D.

In the present study we investigated the influence of substrates on the zinc ion affinity of representatives of subclasses B1 (BcII from Bacillus cereus569/H/9 and BlaB from C. meningosepticum NCTC10585), B2 (CphA from Aeromonas hydrophila), and B3 (the only known tetrameric enzyme, L1, from Stenotrophomonas maltophilia). The metallo-β-lactamases CphA fromA. hydrophila AE036, BcII from B. cereus 569/H/9, L1 from S. maltophilia, and BlaB from C. meningosepticum NCTC10585 were produced and purified as described in Refs. 15Hernandez Valladares M.

The protein concentrations were determined with the following extinction coefficients: ε280(BcII) = 30,500m−1 cm−1, ε280(CphA) = 38,000 m−1cm−1, ε280(L1) = 55,000m−1 cm−1 (per monomer), and ε280(BlaB) = 45,670 m−1cm−1. The carbapenem antibiotic imipenem (Merck Sharp & Dohme) was used as a substrate for all enzymes studied except for BlaB. Hydrolysis was followed at 300 nm using Δε300 = −9,000m−1 cm−1. BlaB was studied with nitrocefin (Unipath Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK) as the substrate using Δε482 = 15,000 m−1cm−1 to follow the hydrolysis. To minimize zinc ion contamination, buffer solutions were prepared in bidistilled water and extensively stirred with Chelex 100 (Sigma). Zinc concentrations in apoenzyme samples were measured with a PerkinElmer 2100 atomic absorption spectrometer in the flame mode at protein concentrations of 50–100 μm as described (8Hernandez Valladares M. Kiefer M. Heinz U. Paul-Soto R. Meyer-Klaucke W. Nolting H.F. Zeppezauer M. Galleni M. Frère J.-M. Rossolini G.M. Amicosante G. Adolph H.W. FEBS Lett. 2000; 467: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The apoenzymes of BcII and L1 were prepared by three dialysis steps of the corresponding enzymes (2 and 10 mg/ml, respectively) against a 250-fold excess of 15 mm HEPES, pH 7.0 and 6.5, respectively, containing 20 mm EDTA (24 h each with stirring at 4 °C). EDTA was removed by three dialysis steps against the same buffer containing 1 m sodium chloride followed by two steps without salt or with 0.15 m NaCl for BcII and L1, respectively. Zinc-free CphA was obtained similarly by dialysis against three changes of 10 mm EDTA in 15 mm HEPES, pH 6.5. EDTA was removed by six dialysis steps against 15 mmHEPES, pH 6.5, containing 0.15 m NaCl for the first two dialysis steps. Apo-BlaB was produced by three dialysis steps of the enzyme (1.3 mg/ml) against a 150-fold volume excess of 30 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, containing 20 mmEDTA, 0.1 m NaCl (12 h each with stirring at 4 °C). EDTA was removed by dialysis against three changes of a 150-fold volume excess of 30 mm sodium cacodylate, 1.0 m NaCl, pH 6.5, followed by two changes of the same buffer containing 0.1m NaCl (or without NaCl). In all apoenzyme preparations the remaining zinc content did not exceed 1–7.5%. The dissociation constants for a first (K mono) and a second zinc ion (K bi) bound in the absence of substrates were obtained from competition experiments with the chromophoric zinc chelator Mag-fura-2 (MF) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The method is based on the different spectroscopic characteristics of MF and the Zn-Mag-fura-2 complex (Zn-MF). The dissociation constant of Zn-MF and the absorption coefficient of MF at 363 nm were determined from titrations with zinc ions under the conditions used in the competition experiments and resulted in K Zn-MF = 28 nm and ε(MF,363 nm) = 28,500m−1 cm−1. The competition experiments with apoenzymes were performed at protein/MF ratios between 1:1 and 1:3 following the total absorbance at 363 nm, which is composed of contributions from MF and Zn-MF according to Equation 1.Atotal=ɛMF[MF]+ɛZn­MF[Zn­MF]Equation 1 Solutions containing apoenzyme ([E]start) and a known concentration of MF ([MF]start) were titrated with zinc and resulted in data that give the total absorbance (A total) measured as a function of the added volume of a metal ion stock solution ([Zn]stock) to a defined starting volume. For numerical data analysis we used the program Chemsim, which calculates simulated absorbance values for each titration step according to Equation 1. The bases for these calculations are the laws of mass action (EquationsEquation 2, Equation 3, Equation 4), the ionic product of water when needed (see the competition experiments with EDTA), and the equations for mass conservation.MF+Zn2+↔K(Zn­MF)Zn­MF,KZn­MF=[Zn2+][MF][Zn­MF]=28nMEquation 2 E+Zn2+↔ZnE,Kmono=[Zn2+][E][ZnE]=?MEquation 3 ZnE+Zn2+↔Zn2E,Kbi=[Zn2+][ZnE][Zn2E]=?MEquation 4 For data evaluation of competition experiments εMF, [MF]start,K Zn-MF, starting volume, and [Zn]stock were constrained.

For the determination of zinc dissociation constants of metallo-β-lactamases in the presence of substrates, we have developed a method based on steady-state rate determinations. The method makes use of the competition of the enzymes (E) with EDTA (Y4−) for the available zinc ions. Under conditions where [EDTA]total ≫ [E]total, EDTA has the role of a zinc ion buffer by solely defining the free zinc ion concentration ([Zn2+]free) as a function of [Zn]total/[EDTA]total. The zinc binding characteristics of EDTA are strongly pH-dependent, because only the fully deprotonated compound (Y4−) has a strong affinity for zinc, whereas HY3− and H2Y2− are the dominating protonation states at physiological pH. The dissociation constant of the ZnHY−complex is already millimolar (Equation 12), and the binding of Zn2+ to H2Y2− is too weak to be considered. Additionally, the formation of ZnOH+ and the solubility product of Zn(OH)2( Ksol,Zn(OH)2) significantly contribute to the distribution of zinc among different compounds. For a given [Zn]total/[EDTA]total ratio, the following equilibria determine [Zn2+]free (Equations Equation 5, Equation 6, Equation 7, Equation 8, Equation 9, Equation 10, Equation 11, Equation 12).Y4−+H+↔HY3−,Ka,HY3−=[H+][Y4−][HY3−]=5.888×10−11MEquation 5 (Ref.18)HY3−+H+↔H2Y2−,Ka,H2Y2−=[H+][HY3−][H2Y2−]=6.309×10−7MEquation 6 (Ref.18)H2Y2−+H+↔H3Y−,Ka,H3Y−=[H+][H2Y2−][H3Y−]=2.138×10−3MEquation 7 (Ref.18)H3Y−+H+↔H4Y,Ka,H4Y=[H+][H3Y−][H4Y]=1.023×10−2MEquation 8 (Ref.18)Zn2++OH−↔ZnOH+,Kd,ZnOH−=[Zn2+][OH−][ZnOH+]=1.122×10−5MEquation 9 (Ref.19)ZnOH++OH−↔Zn(OH)2,Ksol,Zn(OH)2=[ZnOH+][OH−][Zn(OH)2]=5.371×10−11MEquation 10 (Ref.19)Y4−+Zn2+↔ZnY2−,Kd,ZnY2−=[Zn2+][Y4−][ZnY2−]=5.75×10−17MEquation 11 (Ref.20)HY3−+Zn2+↔ZnHY−,Kd,ZnHY−=[Zn2+][HY3−][ZnHY−]=1.00×10−3MEquation 12 (Ref.20) If competition experiments with EDTA are used to determineK mono and K bi, Equations 3 and 4 have to be included additionally. For an experimental determination, a signal is required that systematically changes with a changing ratio of [Zn]total/[EDTA]total. We chose to monitor the changes of enzymatic activities. Reactions were started by the addition of apoenzyme stock solutions to cuvettes containing the given concentrations of substrate, EDTA, and zinc. The apoenzymes were preincubated with EDTA to guarantee that no initial activity due to residual bound zinc was left. Activities were determined after steady-state conditions had been established. The reported values are the means of at least three independent determinations. All experiments were performed at 25 °C in 15 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, except those with BlaB, which were performed in 30 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5. The activities obtained at defined ratios of [Zn]total/[EDTA]total (νobs) result from Equation 13.νobs=kapp,ZnE[ZnE]+kapp,Zn2E[Zn2E]Equation 13 For all the enzymes investigated, the apparent specific activities of the Zn1 and Zn2 enzyme species (k app,ZnE and kapp,Zn2E, respectively) appeared to be different. Conditions were chosen so that the experimentally varied range of [Zn2+]free coveredK mono and K bi. Thus, a series of activity measurements at different ratios of [Zn]total/[EDTA]total could be treated like a titration and subjected to numerical data analysis. Data files were generated giving the activity measured (νobs) as a function of the added volume of a metal ion stock solution ([Zn]stock) to a defined starting volume containing a known concentration of apoenzyme ([E]start) and total EDTA ([EDTA]start). In the numerical data analysis, Equations Equation 3, Equation 4, Equation 5, Equation 6, Equation 7, Equation 8, Equation 9, Equation 10, Equation 11, Equation 12 defined the underlying equilibria, and Equation 13 was used to calculate the zinc concentration-dependent signal. Starting concentrations of apoenzyme, EDTA (or total zinc), and the proton concentration were constrained for the simultaneous optimization ofK mono, K bi,k app,ZnE , and kapp,Zn2E. The same set of equations could be used for all experiments by changing the starting concentrations of total EDTA, zinc, and enzyme as well as pH to the appropriate values. Here we present a systematic investigation of the influence of substrates on the zinc dissociation constants of representatives of all three subclasses of metallo-β-lactamases. Dissociation constants for a first and a second zinc ion bound to BcII, BlaB, and L1 in the absence of substrate were determined in competition experiments with the chromophoric Zn(II) chelator Mag-fura-2. BlaB and L1 bind two zinc ions with very similar affinity, whereas BcII shows strong negative cooperativity for zinc binding (TableI). It was shown for cadmium-substituted BcII that the metal ion in the mononuclear enzyme moves between both binding sites in a microsecond time regime (21Hemmingsen L. Damblon C. Antony J. Jensen M.

A similar dynamic behavior might account for the negative cooperativity observed for zinc-bound BcII (9de Seny D. Heinz U. Wommer S. Kiefer M. Meyer-Klaucke W. Galleni M. Frère J.-M. Bauer R.

For all the apoenzymes studied we observed a spontaneous reactivation in the presence of substrates, although metal-depleted buffers were used. Whereas the reactivation of BcII is slow (Fig.1 A), CphA reaches full activity of imipenem conversion after 25 s (Fig. 1 B). We have shown earlier (4Hernandez Valladares M. Felici A. Weber G. Adolph H.W. Zeppezauer M. Rossolini G.M. Amicosante G. Frère J.M. Galleni M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11534-11541Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) that metal-depleted buffers still contain up to 20 nm Zn(II). Such concentrations are sufficient to completely reconstitute CphA (8 nm in the experiment shown in Fig. 1) but not BcII (40 nm in the experiment). Therefore full reactivation of BcII could only be expected with added Zn(II). The addition of 100 μm EDTA to the reaction medium prevented the reactivation of BcII (Fig. 1 A) but not of CphA (Fig. 1 B). Thus, both enzymes show different affinities for zinc in the presence of substrate, and CphA is obviously able to strongly compete with EDTA for available zinc ions. When 100 μm EDTA and 90 μm Zn(II) were simultaneously present, BcII and CphA reached about 30 and 80%, respectively, of the activity measured in the presence of Zn(II) without EDTA. The free zinc ion concentration available for the reconstitution of the enzymes was in the picomolar range (see Fig.2). With the recently determined second order rate constant for zinc binding to apo-BcII ofk on = 14 μm−1s−1 (9de Seny D. Heinz U. Wommer S. Kiefer M. Meyer-Klaucke W. Galleni M. Frère J.-M. Bauer R. Adolph H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45065-45078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), the half-life time for reactivation of apo-BcII via the pool of free zinc ions can be calculated (t 12 = ln 2/(k on[Zn]free)) and results in, for example, 80 min for a free zinc concentration of 10 pm. Because the process is finished within a few seconds, it follows that a pool of free zinc ions cannot be relevant for reactivating the enzyme. It might be concluded that Zn-EDTA and apoenzyme form a ternary EDTA-Zn(II)-BcII complex that allows a fast transfer of zinc ions to the enzyme binding site in a ligand exchange reaction.Figure 2Determination of dissociation constants of Zn(II)-metallo-β-lactamase complexes in the presence of a substrate. The competition between the different apoenzymes and EDTA was used to determine dissociation constants of the zinc enzymes in the presence of substrates as described under “Materials and Methods.” Reactions were started by the addition of concentrated apoenzyme solutions to the reaction medium. Steady-state rates were determined at different [Zn]tot/[EDTA]tot ratios and are presented as relative activities (filled circles) compared with rates obtained with an excess of zinc ions (A,C, and D) or compared with rates obtained for the Zn1-enzyme (B). The averaged dissociation constants obtained from three independent experiments each are listed in Table I. The theoretical curves shown (continuous lines) represent simulations of the respective experiments with the best fit parameters and an increased data point density to visualize the exact shape of the theoretical curves. The respectivepanels to the right represent the relative activities (filled circles) versus the calculated free zinc concentration on a logarithmic scale together with the fitted theoretical curve (continuous line). The open symbols represent simulated data for the occupancy of the available enzyme with zinc ([Zn]bound/[enzyme]total, right y-axis). Open circles represent data in the presence of a substrate. For comparison, the respective saturation curves in the absence of substrates were simulated with Equations Equation 1, Equation 2, Equation 3 and the dissociation constants from Table I(open squares). A, the relative activities of 92 nm BcII with a starting concentration of 0.15 mm imipenem were determined in the presence of 0.1 mm EDTA and a total zinc ion concentration ranging between 0 and 0.11 mm. B, the relative activities of 8 nm CphA with a starting concentration of 0.15 mm imipenem were determined in the presence of 1 mm EDTA and a total zinc ion concentration ranging between 0 and 1.1 mm. C, the relative activities of 26 nm L1 with a starting concentration of 0.15 mmimipenem were determined in the presence of 100 μm EDTA and a zinc ion concentration ranging between 0 and 170 μm. The left y-axis is split to better visualize the activities of Zn1-L1, which are <5% of the activity of the Zn2-enzyme. D, metal-free BlaB (22 nm) was incubated with 2 eq of Zn(II) (44 nm) and varied concentrations of EDTA (0–200 nm) in 30 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5. The relative activities were determined with nitrocefin (100 μm starting concentration, filled circles) by the addition of substrate to the preincubated enzyme. The relative activities are plotted versus the total EDTA concentration.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Whereas BcII and L1 were fully activated within the dead time of the experiments (∼5 s), the reactivation of CphA is characterized by a lag phase. At first glance the lag phase might indicate a slow association of zinc ions because of its limited concentration. However, the same effect is observed with 100 nm Zn(II) in the absence of EDTA (Fig. 1 B). The most plausible explanation for these results is a fast formation of a stable apoenzyme-substrate complex with CphA, which blocks the access of zinc ions to the metal binding site. The observed reactivation rate would thus be determined by the dissociation rate of the substrate from the apoenzyme. On the basis of these observations we developed a method for the determination of dissociation constants for zinc ions during activity measurements in the presence of EDTA. The steady-state rates observed at different [Zn]total/[EDTA]total ratios are a direct measure of the enzyme fractions simultaneously loaded with (one or two) zinc ions and substrates according to Equation 13. With Equations Equation 3, Equation 4, Equation 5, Equation 6, Equation 7, Equation 8, Equation 9, Equation 10, Equation 11, Equation 12, K mono andK bi could be determined numerically together with the parameters for the specific activity of the two different enzyme species k app,ZnE and kapp,Zn2E. In Fig.2 relative activities are used based on the maximum activity obtained under the chosen conditions. After the optimization ofK mono and K bi, EquationsEquation 3, Equation 4, Equation 5, Equation 6, Equation 7, Equation 8, Equation 9, Equation 10, Equation 11, Equation 12 were used to calculate [Zn2+]free from the experimental data and the corresponding theoretical curves (Fig. 2,right panels). For all enzymes investigated two binding steps were observed, one in the picomolar and one in the micromolar range, resulting in two enzyme species with different activities. The apparent dissociation constants obtained when substrates are present (K mono,sub andK bi,sub in Table I) reflect the [Zn]free needed to result in 50% of the enzymes acting as either Zn1 E or Zn2 E under conditions of substrate saturation and strongly deviate from those determined in the absence of substrates. It is evident that the activities measured do not give a direct estimate of enzyme concentrations. Both k app,ZnEand k app,Zn2E are functions of the respectiveK m values and the substrate concentration used. Additional inhibiting effects of EDTA can modify the activities observed. For CphA and BlaB inhibition constants of 1.75 and 1.54 mm, respectively, have been reported (4Hernandez Valladares M. Felici A. Weber G. Adolph H.W. Zeppezauer M. Rossolini G.M. Amicosante G. Frère J.M. Galleni M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11534-11541Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 17Rossolini G.M. Franceschini N. Riccio M.L. Mercuri P.S. Perilli M. Galleni M. Frère J.M. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The values for k app,ZnE and kapp,Zn2E resulting from the fits do not therefore reflect true specific activities (k cat) but include the saturation state of the respective enzyme species. This becomes obvious in the case of BcII where the binuclear enzyme appears to be only slightly more active than the mononuclear enzyme (Fig. 2 A), although the steady-state parameters determined with the mono- and binuclear enzyme indicate a 2-fold higher specific activity (k cat) of the binuclear enzyme (Table I). However, the differentK m values of Zn1- and Zn2-BcII result in different degrees of substrate saturation for the mono- and binuclear enzyme species. Because of experimental limitations, saturating substrate concentrations could only be applied for BlaB and Zn1-L1. Therefore, the concentrations of enzyme-substrate complexes during steady-state were usually lower than the enzyme concentration constrained during the fitting process. To investigate the influence of the degree of substrate saturation (or the exact knowledge of the constrained apoenzyme concentration) on the dissociation constants determined, data were alternatively evaluated by constraining the apoenzyme concentration to different values. Enzyme concentrations constrained to, for example, 10% of the experimental value resulted in 10-fold increased k app,ZnE and kapp,Zn2E, whereas the optimized dissociation constants K mono,suband K bi,sub remained unchanged. All experiments except those with BlaB were performed under conditions where the free zinc ion concentration ([Zn]free) was buffered by EDTA (see “Materials and Methods”). Attempts to study BlaB under similar conditions failed, because this enzyme shows a strong inhibition by EDTA, which is not adequately described by the published inhibition constant. Therefore, a modified (but less precise) experimental approach was used (Fig. 2 D). At a low total zinc ion concentration, the EDTA concentration was varied in a narrow, close to equimolar range to achieve variations in [Zn]free. Under these conditions errors in the fixed apoenzyme concentration have a significant influence on the optimized values for K mono,sub andK bi,sub. Alternative optimizations showed that both dissociation constants are overestimated if the enzyme concentration is overestimated; nevertheless, theK mono,sub/K bi,sub ratio remains almost constant. In the presence of a substrate, all of the enzymes investigated show dissociation constants in the picomolar range for a first zinc ion bound, reflecting an increase of the zinc ion affinity by up to three orders of magnitude. Based on the results from the competition experiments, appropriate conditions for the determination of the kinetic parameters of mono- and binuclear enzymes could be chosen (Table I). Until now, L1 was considered to be a binuclear enzyme requiring two bound zinc ions for activity (22Ullah J.H. Walsh T.R. Taylor I.A. Emery D.C. Verma C.S. Gamblin S.J. Spencer J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 125-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Here we show that L1 is also active as the Zn1 enzyme. Althoughk cat for the Zn1-L1 is a factor of 30 lower than for the Zn2 species, its enzymatic efficiency (k cat /K m ) is only a factor of 3 lower because of the considerably lowerK m . Recent investigations of proteins involved in the regulation of zinc homeostasis suggest that free zinc ions are virtually absent in cellular environments. This similarly applies to eukaryotic cells (11Yang Y. Maret W. Vallee B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5556-5559Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and the bacterial cytosol for which free zinc ion concentrations below 1 fm are expected (13Outten C.E. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 2001; 292: 2488-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). Because most metallo-β-lactamases are characterized by nanomolar dissociation constants in the absence of a substrate, it seems likely that these are inactive apoenzymes in such environments. Furthermore, the nanomolar zinc ion concentrations needed to constitute the active zinc enzymes were shown to be inhibitory for other enzymes like caspase-3 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (23Maret W. Jacob C. Vallee B.L. Fischer E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1936-1940Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, no data concerning the free zinc ion concentration in the periplasm or the extracellular space of growing bacteria in their natural habitat are documented in the literature. Because numerous periplasmatic and extracellular enzymes are zinc proteins, a strong competition can be expected resulting in very low concentrations of free zinc ions. We have demonstrated here that the presence of substrates strongly decreases the dissociation constant of Zn(II)-metallo-β-lactamases, rendering them able to successfully compete with other zinc proteins for the available zinc ions. Thus, the presence of substrates can be considered a signal for the autoregulatory self-activation of apo-metallo-β-lactamases. Such regulation could also prevent the weak peptidase activity (k cat/K m <0.1m−1 s−1) demonstrated for metallo-β-lactamases (24Rhazi N. Galleni M. Page M.I. Frère J.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 409-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), because fully active zinc-β-lactamases could interfere with the DD-peptidase-catalyzed cross-linking of the bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan. An important aspect of the presented results is the high reactivation rate observed in the presence of EDTA. The virtual absence of free zinc ions in cellular systems necessarily results in very long half-life times for a successful constitution of active zinc enzymes via the pool of free zinc ions. However, zinc binding is fast in biological systems, and a direct transfer via discrete (ternary) intermediates was postulated to resolve this problem (25Cox E.H. McLendon G.L. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2000; 4: 162-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In the present study, EDTA serves as an artificial zinc supplier for the constitution of zinc-β-lactamases from the apoenzymes, whereas other zinc-binding factors, most likely proteins, might supply the necessary zinc ionsin vivo. For all three subclasses of metallo-β-lactamases we discovered the following functional characteristics. 1) All the enzymes studied are active as the monozinc enzyme. 2) The substrate presence generally results in a drastic increase of affinity for a first zinc ion. 3) The dissociation constant for a second zinc ion in the presence of a substrate is 4–6 orders of magnitude higher than the first, picomolar mononuclear dissociation constant."

Dense methylation of the region around the transcription start site was detected in 1 out of 10 colorectal, 2 out of 8 gastric, and 6 out of 14 hematopoietic tumor cell lines and in 5 out of 35 (14%) gastric, 6 out of 20 (30%) hepatocellular, and 2 out of 18 (11%) pancreatic cancers; 7 out of 25 (28%) acute myeloid leukemia cases also showed methylation of the p57KIP2 gene, which strongly correlated with the CpG island methylator phenotype (P<0.001). Detailed mapping revealed that dense methylation of the region around the transcription start site (-300 to +400), but not of the edges of the CpG island, was closely associated with gene silencing. 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, a methyltransferase inhibitor, restored expression of p57KIP2, and chromatin immunoprecipitation using anti-histone H3 and H4 antibodies showed histone to be deacetylated in cell lines where p57KIP2 was methylated at the transcription start site. Regional methylation and histone deacetylation thus appear to be crucially involved in the silencing of p57KIP2 expression in human tumors."

The outgrowth lines were transplanted for 10 generations. The outgrowths were ductal in morphology and progressed through ductal hyperplasia and ductal carcinoma in situ before invasive cancer. The preneoplastic outgrowth lines were immortal and exhibited activated telomerase activity. They are estrogen and progesterone receptor-positive, and aneuploid, and had various levels of tumorigenic potential. The biological and genetic properties of these lines are distinct from those found in most hyperplastic alveolar outgrowth lines, the form of mammary preneoplasia occurring in most traditional models of murine mammary tumorigenesis. These results indicate that the preneoplastic cell populations found in this genetically engineered model are similar in biological properties to a subset of precurser lesions found in human breast cancer and provide a unique model to identify secondary events critical for tumorigenicity and invasiveness."
https://openalex.org/W2005435457,"We report the isolation and characterization of a cDNA encoding Dm2-MMP, the second matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) identified in the Drosophila melanogaster genome. The cloned cDNA codes for a polypeptide of 758 residues that displays a domain organization similar to that of other MMPs, including signal peptide, propeptide, catalytic, and hemopexin domains. However, the structure of Dm2-MMP is unique because of the presence of an insertion of 214 amino acids between the catalytic and hemopexin domains that is not present in any of the previously described MMPs. Dm2-MMP also contains a C-terminal extension predicted to form a cleavable glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor site. Western blot and immunofluorescence analysis of S2 cells transfected with the isolated cDNA confirmed that Dm2-MMP is localized at the cell surface. Production of the catalytic domain of Dm2-MMP inEscherichia coli and analysis of its enzymatic activity revealed that this proteinase cleaves several synthetic peptides used for analysis of vertebrate MMPs. This proteolytic activity was abolished by MMP inhibitors such as BB-94, confirming that the isolated cDNA codes for an enzymatically active metalloproteinase. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis showed thatDm2-MMP is expressed at low levels in all of the developmental stages of Drosophila as well as in adult flies. However, detailed in situ hybridization at the larval stage revealed a strong tissue-specific expression in discrete regions of the brain and eye imaginal discs. According to these results, we propose that Dm2-MMP plays both general proteolytic functions during Drosophila development and in adult tissues and specific roles in eye development and neural tissues through the degradation and remodeling of the extracellular matrix.

In addition, deregulated production of these endopeptidases is associated with a number of pathological conditions including rheumatoid arthritis (4Konttinen Y. Ainola M. Valleala H., Ma, J. Ida H.

Oncol. 2000; 18: 1135-1149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To date, more than 20 distinct MMPs have been identified in human tissues (7Lohi J. Wilson C.L. Roby J.D. Parks W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10134-10144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 8Marchenko G.N. Strongin A.Y.

These MMPs have been classified into six major subfamilies according to their primary structures, domain organization, cellular localization, and substrate specificity. These subfamilies are collagenases, stromelysins, gelatinases, matrilysins, membrane-type MMPs, and other MMPs (9Urı́a J.A. López-Otı́n C. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4745-4751PubMed Google Scholar). The structure of most of these enzymes is organized into several characteristic domains: a signal peptide to direct secretion from the cell, a prodomain with a conserved Cys residue involved in maintaining the enzyme latency, a catalytic domain with a zinc-binding site, and a hemopexin-like domain that plays a role in substrate binding as well as in mediating interactions with the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), a family of endogenous inhibitors of MMPs (10Brew K. Dinakarpandian D. Nagase H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 267-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (1610) Google Scholar). Several members of the human MMP family lack some of these well defined domains. Thus, MMP-23, the most distantly related family member, does not contain a cleavable signal peptide (11Velasco G. Pendas A.M. Fueyo A. Knauper V. Murphy G. López-Otı́n C. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 33988-33997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), whereas matrilysins have lost the hemopexin domain (9Urı́a J.A. López-Otı́n C. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4745-4751PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, additional domains such as fibronectin-like repeats or C-terminal hydrophobic extensions have been incorporated into the structure of other family members like gelatinases or membrane-type MMPs, thereby contributing to generate a considerable diversity in the structural organization of these enzymes. In close parallelism with the structural complexity of MMPs, recent functional studies have revealed that these proteinases are also involved in processes distinct from those derived from their ability to degrade the different protein components of the extracellular matrix and basement membranes. Thus, MMPs play direct roles in essential cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, angiogenesis, apoptosis, or defense responses through their ability to target other substrates including proteinase inhibitors, chemokines, antimicrobial peptides, and membrane-bound precursors of growth factors, cytokines, and hormone receptors (13Werb Z.

An important aspect in understanding the increased functional diversity of this growing family of proteolytic enzymes is to identify and characterize MMPs in model organisms, in which the functional relevance of these enzymes can be extensively analyzed by using distinct experimental strategies. Thus, in addition to the diverse MMPs identified in vertebrates, proteases belonging to this family have also been described in a variety of organisms from plants such asArabidopsis thaliana (19Maidment J.M.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and cucumber (21Delorme V.G. McCabe P.F. Kim D.J. Leaver C.J. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 917-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), to invertebrates like Caenorhabditis elegans (22Wada K. Sato H. Kinoh H. Kajita M. Yamamoto H. Seiki M. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 21: 57-62Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar), sea urchin (23Lepage T. Gache C. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3003-3012Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), Hydra vulgaris (24Leontovich A.A. Zhang J. Shimokawa K. Nagase H. Sarras M.P. Jr. Development. 2000; 127: 907-922PubMed Google Scholar), and more recently Drosophila melanogaster (25Llano E. Pendas A.M. Aza-Blanc P. Kornberg T.B. López-Otı́n C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35978-35985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In this regard, we have described the finding and characterization of Dm1-MMP, the first member of this proteinase family identified inDrosophila (25Llano E. Pendas A.M. Aza-Blanc P. Kornberg T.B. López-Otı́n C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35978-35985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), a model organism that is central to the study of developmental biology. Because of the relevance of MMPs in developmental processes, the finding of additional members of this family in Drosophila may contribute to uncover new substrates and new functions for these enzymes, potentially extrapolable to vertebrate MMPs. In this study, we report the cloning and the structural and enzymatic characterization ofDm2-MMP, the second member of the MMP family identified inD. melanogaster. Interestingly, extensive searches of theDrosophila genome revealed the presence of only two MMPs in this organism, thus offering a simplified and genetically tractable system to study MMP function in development. We have also performed an expression analysis of Dm2-MMP during Drosophiladevelopment, showing that the gene is expressed at all stages. Detailedin situ hybridization analysis at the larval stage revealed a strong expression in discrete regions of the brain and eye imaginal discs. Taken together, our data suggest that this novel MMP member may play both general and specific degradative roles in the extracellular matrix remodeling processes occurring in Drosophila during development and in adult tissues. Synthetic oligonucleotides were prepared with an Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) model 392A DNA synthesizer. Restriction endonucleases and reagents used for molecular cloning were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Double-stranded DNA probes were radiolabeled with [32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) fromAmersham Biosciences, using a commercial random priming kit from the same company. Screening of the GenBankTM data base for entries with similarity to previously described MMPs allowed us to identify a sequence (AC005894) contributed by the BerkeleyDrosophila Genome Project. This sequence revealed regions with significant similarity to the catalytic and hemopexin domains of MMPs. To obtain the corresponding cDNA sequence, two specific primers 5′-TGCAGACCGCCCTGGACGT (primer 1, catalytic domain) and 5′-ATGTAGGTGCGGTTGTTGTGG (primer 2, hemopexin domain) were used for PCR amplification to prepare a probe for screening of cDNAs from different developmental stages. The PCR reaction was carried out in a GeneAmp 2400 PCR system from PerkinElmer Life Sciences for 30 cycles of denaturation (94 °C for 15 s), annealing (60 °C for 15 s), and extension (72 °C for 45 s). A 1473-bp PCR product amplified from pupa cDNA was radiolabeled and used to screen a pupa cDNA library according to standard procedures (26Sambrook J. Russel D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000Google Scholar). In addition, we obtained a 4120-bp full-length cDNA (SD03462) identified by the BerkeleyDrosophila Genome Project (Research Genetics). Cloned DNA fragments were sequenced with an Applied Biosystems 310A automatic sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Computer analysis of DNA and protein sequences was performed with the GCG software package of the University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group. Full-length Dm2-MMP cDNA was subcloned into pRmHA-3 expression vector (27Bunch T.A. Graner M.W. Fessler L.I. Fessler J.H. Schneider K.D. Kerschen A. Choy L.P. Burgess B.W. Brower D.L. Development. 1998; 125: 1679-1689Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, a 24-bp linker coding for the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope of the human influenza virus was inserted immediately downstream of the putative furin cleavage motif. S2 cells were transfected with 1 μg of plasmid DNA, using the FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Forty-eight hours after transfection, CuSO4 was added to a final concentration of 0.7 mm to induce the cells and incubated for 6–18 h to produce the protein. The cells were then fixed for 10 min in cold 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, washed in PBS, and incubated for 10 min in the presence or absence of 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS. Fluorescent detection was performed by incubating the slides with monoclonal antibody 12CA5 (Roche Applied Science) against HA (diluted 1:2500), followed by another incubation with goat anti-mouse fluoresceinated antibody (diluted 1:50). After washing in PBS, the slides were mounted with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and observed in a Bio-Rad confocal laser microscope. S2 extracts were also obtained for Western blot analysis of the Dm2-MMP-HA protein. S2 cells were transiently transfected with the pRmHA-3-Dm2-MMP-HA plasmid as described previously. The cells were scraped from the plates, and the membrane fractions were prepared essentially following the procedure described by Stronginet al. (28Strongin A.Y. Collier I. Bannikov G. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5331-5338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar). The extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE, analyzed by Western blotting with an anti-HA monoclonal antibody, and detected with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (AmershamBiosciences). A 462-bp fragment of the Dm2-MMP cDNA containing the catalytic domain was generated by PCR amplification with primers 5′-GGAATTCCATATGTTCGCCCTGCAGGGACCCAAG (NdeI-proDm2) and 5′-CGGGATCCTTAGTACAACTGCTGAATGCCATA (BamHI-proDm2) using the full-length Dm2-MMP cDNA as a template. PCR amplification was performed for 30 cycles using the ExpandTM high fidelity PCR system. Because of the design of the oligonucleotides, the amplified fragment could be cleaved at both ends with NdeI and BamHI and ligated in frame into the pET E. coli expression vector (Novagen). The resulting pET-Dm2 vector was transformed into BL21(DE3) E. coli cells, and expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (final concentration, 0.5 mm) followed by further incubation for 20 h at 30 °C. Recombinant protein obtained in inclusion bodies was solubilized using 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.6, containing 6 m GdnHCl and 5 mm dithiothreitol and purified in a Superdex-75 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.6, containing 3 m GdnHCl and 5 mm dithiothreitol. After SDS-PAGE analysis, peak fractions with the recombinant protein were pooled, and the GdnHCl concentration was adjusted to 6 m. Refolding was achieved by dialysis, first against a 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.6, containing 5 mm CaCl2, 200 mm NaCl, 50 μm ZnSO4, 0.05% Brij 35, 20% glycerol, and 2 m GdnHCl and then against the same buffer with 2 mm dithiothreitol and without GdnHCl. Enzymatic activity of purified recombinantDm2-MMP was analyzed by using the synthetic fluorescent substrates Mca-Pro-Leu-Gly-Leu-Dpa-Ala-Arg-NH2 (QF-24), Mca-Pro-Leu-Ala-Nva-Dpa-Ala-Arg-NH2 (QF-35), and Mca-Pro-Cha-Gly-Nva-His-Ala-Dpa-NH2 (QF-41) (provided by C. G. Knight, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK). The assays were performed at 37 °C at substrate concentrations of 1 μm in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris/HCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 200 mm NaCl, 0.05% (v/v) Brij 35, pH 7.6, and 1% Me2SO (29Willembrock F. Crabbe T. Slocombe P.M. Sutton C.W. Docherty A.J.P. Cockett M.I. O'Shea M.I. Brocklehurst K. Phillips I.R. Murphy G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4330-4337Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). For inhibition assays,Dm2-MMP (20 nm) and inhibitors were preincubated for 30 min at 20 °C, with 1 mm EDTA or with BB-94 (British-Biotech Pharmaceuticals, Oxford, UK) at concentrations ranging from 0 to 100 nm. The fluorometric measurements were made in an MPF-44A PerkinElmer Life Sciences spectrofluorometer (λex = 328 nm, λem = 393 nm). A three-dimensional model of the catalytic domain of Dm2-MMP was calculated using Swiss-Model, a semiautomated modeling server (30Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9641) Google Scholar), and analyzed with the Swiss Protein Data Bank Viewer. The quality of the resulting models was verified automatically with WhatCheck and manually with the Swiss Protein Data Bank Viewer. Electrostatic analyses of the model were performed with MolMol (31Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graphics. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar). RT-PCR was performed for analysis ofDm2-MMP expression during Drosophila development or in adult flies. Total RNA was extracted from diverse developmental stages of Drosophila or from adult tissues, and 1 μg was used to perform the reverse transcription. The PCR reaction was carried out for 35 cycles of denaturation (94 °C for 15 s), annealing (60 °C for 15 s), and extension (72 °C for 25 s) using two specific oligonucleotides 5′-TTACCTCATGCAGTTTGATTATCT (primer 1), and 5′-CTCCACGTAAGATCCGTTCTG (primer 2). The integrity of RNA was verified by similar RT-PCR experiments using specific primers for theDrosophila gene encoding ribosomal protein 49 (rp-49). RNA in situ analysis was performed as described previously (32Gavis E.R. Lehmann R Cell. 1992; 71: 301-313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. The hybridizations were carried out overnight at 55 °C, and the alkaline phosphatase detection buffer was prepared from Sigma Fast TM 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium tablets instead of Tris/HCl. Digoxigenin-labeled RNA probes made from cDNA SD04362 were prepared according to the protocol described for the Genius system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). A computer search of the data base of Drosophila genomic sequences allowed us to identify a sequence (AC005894) that contains a region with significant similarity to the catalytic and hemopexin domains found in most vertebrate MMPs. To define the precise structure of this putative novel fly MMP, we undertook the isolation of a cDNA encoding this protein. First, we prepared a specific probe for this enzyme by PCR amplification of total λ-phage DNA obtained from a fly pupa cDNA library. The identity of the PCR-amplified product was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing, and then it was used as a probe to isolate a 3.4-kb cDNA clone from the same fly pupa λgt-11 library. The sequence of this clone was subsequently confirmed and extended by nucleotide sequence analysis of a 4120-bp cDNA clone (SD03462) obtained from the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project and isolated from a Schneider L2 cell cDNA library. Computer analysis of the 3.4- and 4.1-kb cDNA isolated sequences revealed the presence of a unique open reading frame that encodes a protein of 758 residues with a calculated molecular mass of 89 kDa (Fig.1). These sequences would be encoded by one of the annotated genes (CG1794, located in region 45F6–46A1) in the Drosophila genome sequence recently reported (33Adams M.D. Celniker S.E. Holt R.A. Evans C.A. Gocayne J.D. Amanatides P.G. et al.Science. 2000; 287: 2185-2195Crossref PubMed Scopus (4854) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, there are several differences in the number and location of computer-predicted exons for CG1794, when compared with the experimental data derived from the cDNA sequences reported herein (Fig. 1). In addition, pairwise comparisons of the protein sequence derived in this work with those described previously for other MMPs demonstrated that the new sequence contains all the structural features present in members of this protease family (Fig.2 A). From N terminus to C terminus, it includes a predicted N-terminal cleavable signal peptide that targets these proteolytic enzymes to the secretory pathway. The deduced sequence also contains a propeptide region with the conserved motif PRCGVXD (at positions 106–112), which is involved in maintaining the latency of these proteinases. This prodomain ends in a stretch of basic amino acid residues (RVRR, at positions 133–136) that mediates the intracellular activation of several MMPs including membrane-type MMPs, stromelysin-3, and MMP-28 by furin-like enzymes (7Lohi J.

A, amino acid sequence alignment of the catalytic domains ofDm2-MMP and those of different vertebrate and invertebrate MMPs. The amino acid sequences of the different MMPs were extracted from the SwissProt data base, and the multiple alignment was performed with the PILEUP program of the GCG package. Residues common to all sequences are shaded. Gaps are indicated bydots. The numbering corresponds to the sequence of the catalytic domain of Dm2-MMP. B, domain organization of Dm2-MMP and comparison with that ofDm1-MMP. The characteristic insertion of theDm2-MMP is indicated by the horizontally striped box.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The sequence alignment shown in Fig. 2 B also confirms the presence in the Drosophila MMP sequence of a catalytic domain of about 170 residues, containing the zinc-binding site (HEXGHXXGXXH, at positions 257–267) and the Ser residue (position 268) that distinguishes MMPs from other metalloproteinases. There is also a conserved Met residue located seven residues C-terminal to the zinc-binding site that is proposed to play an important role in the structure of the MMPs active sites (36Bode W. Gomis-Rüth F.X. Stöcker W. FEBS Lett. 1993; 331: 134-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). Finally, the identified sequence contains a C-terminal fragment of about 200 residues similar to the hemopexin-like domain found in most MMPs. According to these structural features, we suggest that the cloned cDNA encodes a new MMP family member that has been named Dm2-MMP, because it is the second MMP identified and characterized in D. melanogaster. A more detailed analysis of the amino acid sequence deduced forDm2-MMP revealed that in addition to common features shared with MMPs, it also shows some specific features unique to this protein (Fig. 2 A). Thus, it contains an insertion of about 200 amino acids in the hinge region located between the catalytic and hemopexin domains (at positions 308–509). This insertion is not present in the sequence of Dm1-MMP or in those reported for the remaining members of this family. In this extra domain found inDm2-MMP, there is a long stretch of Thr residues and multiple repeats of a seven-amino acid sequence containing Glu, Gln, and Arg residues (RQEEERR, or variants of this sequence). It is also remarkable that Dm2-MMP lacks conserved residues characteristic of collagenases or stromelysins (37Sánchez-López R. Alexander C.M. Behrendtsen O. Breathnach R. Werb Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7238-7247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Freije J.P. Dı́ez-Itza I. Balbı́n M. Sánchez L.M. Blasco R. Tolivia J. López-Otı́n C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16766-16773Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as well as the fibronectin-like domain present in all gelatinases. Interestingly,Dm2-MMP possesses a C-terminal extension rich in acidic residues and ending in a stretch of hydrophobic residues that is predicted to form a cleavable glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor site (program available at 129.194.186.123/GPI-anchor/index_en.html). Therefore, it is likely that Dm2-MMP belongs to the subfamily of membrane-type MMPs structurally characterized by having a hydrophobic region at the C-terminal end as well as by the presence of the furin-like activation sequence between the propeptide and the catalytic domain (39Sato H. Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J. Shinagawa A. Yamamoto E. Seiki M. Nature. 1994; 27: 61-65Crossref Scopus (2379) Google Scholar, 40Puente X.S. Pendas A.M. Llano E. Velasco G. López-Otı́n C.

Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 877-882PubMed Google Scholar). The intron-exon distribution of the gene encoding Dm2-MMP is also somewhat similar to that of some vertebrate MMPs, such as MMP-28 and MT6-MMP, and markedly different from that of Dm1-MMP (Fig.3). To provide experimental support to the above hypothesis on the putative membrane localization of Dm2-MMP, we transfected S2 cells with pRmHa-3-Dm2-MMP-HA, a construct containing the HA epitope immediately downstream of the furin-like cleavage motif present in the amino acid sequence deduced for Dm2-MMP. Transfected cells were then analyzed by Western blot with a mouse monoclonal antibody (12CA5) specific for this viral epitope. As shown in Fig.4 A, Dm2-MMP was detected in the membrane-enriched fractions but not in the soluble fraction. To provide additional information on the subcellular distribution of Dm2-MMP, we transfected S2 cells with the pRmHa-3-Dm2-MMP-HA construct, and transfected cells were then analyzed by immunofluorescence with the 12CA5 antibody. As shown in Fig. 4 B, a fluorescent pattern surrounding the cell was clearly visualized in a serial optical section obtained by the confocal microscope. Taken together, these results provide experimental evidence that Dm2-MMP is a member of the membrane-type MMP subfamily of MMPs. After the preceding findings showing thatDm2-MMP was structurally related to MMPs, we next evaluated the possibility that this protein could be a functionally active member of this proteinase family. For this purpose, a cDNA construct coding for the Dm2-MMP catalytic domain was expressed inE. coli following the same strategy described previously for Dm1-MMP (25Llano E. Pendas A.M. Aza-Blanc P.

To assess the substrate specificity of the recombinant protease, a series of quenched fluorescent peptides commonly used for assaying vertebrate MMPs were employed. As shown in Fig. 6, the general MMP substrate QF-24, the collagenase/gelatinase substrate QF-41, and the stromelysin substrate QF-35 were hydrolyzed by Dm2-MMP. Next, we examined the potential inhibition of active Dm2-MMP by EDTA and the hydroxamic acid-based inhibitor BB-94, using QF-24 as substrate. As can be seen in Fig. 6, EDTA completely abolished the hydrolyzing activity of Dm2-MMP, whereas BB-94 extensively blocked this proteolytic activity.Figure 6Analysis of enzymatic activity ofDm2-MMP.

We detected 395 out of 1,200 tested transcripts, which reflected 1%-5% of totally expressed genes. From various cellular functional pathways, we detected multiple genes that spanned a 200-fold range of gene expression levels. Statistical analysis combining L1 regression with the sign test based on the conservative Bonferroni correction identified 105 genes that underwent transcriptional adaptations with atrophy. Generally, expressional changes were discrete (<50%) and pointed in the same direction for genes belonging to the same cellular functional units. In particular, a distinct expressional adaptation of genes involved in fiber transformation; that is, metabolism, protein turnover, and cell regulation were noted and matched to corresponding transcriptional changes in nutrient trafficking. Expressional changes of extracellular proteases, and of genes involved in nerve-muscle interaction and excitation-contraction coupling identify previously not recognized adaptations that occur in atrophic m. soleus. Considerations related to technical and statistical aspects of the array approach for profiling the skeletal muscle genome and the impact of observed novel adaptations of the m. soleus transcriptome are put into perspective of the physiological adaptations occurring with muscular atrophy."
https://openalex.org/W2059912335,"Thapsigargin (TG), by inducing perturbations in cellular Ca(2+) homeostasis, has been shown to induce apoptosis. The molecular mechanisms of Ca(2+) perturbation-induced apoptosis are not fully understood. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that TG-mediated perturbations in Ca(2+) homeostasis are coupled with activation of the death receptor 5 (DR5)-dependent apoptotic pathway in human cancer cells. TG selectively upregulated DR5 but had no effect on the expression of the other TRAIL receptor, DR4. TG also upregulated the expression of the DR5 ligand TRAIL (tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand), albeit in a cell-type specific manner. TG-induced apoptosis has been shown to be associated with activation of the mitochondrial pathway. We found that TG upregulation of DR5 and TRAIL was coupled with caspase 8 activation and Bid cleavage, suggesting that the TG-regulated DR5 pathway could be linked to the mitochondrial pathway. TG enhanced not only DR5 mRNA stability but also increased induction of the DR5 genomic promoter-reporter gene. The TG-induced increase in DR5 expression appeared to occur as a consequence of TG-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca(2+) pool depletion. Thus, we report our novel findings that ER Ca(2+) pool depletion-induced apoptotic signals are mediated, at least in part, via a DR5-dependent apoptotic pathway and there appears to be a cross-talk between the death receptor and mitochondrial pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2005063238,"Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) is a serine-threonine kinase that is involved in multiple cellular signaling pathways, including the Wnt signaling cascade where it phosphorylates β-catenin, thus targeting it for proteasome-mediated degradation. Unlike phosphorylation of glycogen synthase, phosphorylation of β-catenin by GSK-3 does not require primingin vitro, i.e. it is not dependent on the presence of a phosphoserine, four residues C-terminal to the GSK-3 phosphorylation site. Recently, a means of dissecting GSK-3 activity toward primed and non-primed substrates has been made possible by identification of the R96A mutant of GSK-3β. This mutant is unable to phosphorylate primed but can still phosphorylate unprimed substrates (Frame, S., Cohen, P., and Biondi R. M. (2001) Mol. Cell 7, 1321–1327). Here we have investigated whether phosphorylation of Ser33, Ser37, and Thr41 in β-catenin requires priming through prior phosphorylation at Ser45 in intact cells. We have shown that the Arg96 mutant does not induce β-catenin degradation but instead stabilizes β-catenin, indicating that it is unable to phosphorylate β-catenin in intact cells. Furthermore, if Ser45 in β-catenin is mutated to Ala, β-catenin is markedly stabilized, and phosphorylation of Ser33, Ser37, and Thr41 in β-catenin by wild type GSK-3β is prevented in intact cells. In addition, we have shown that the L128A mutant, which is deficient in phosphorylating Axin in vitro, is still able to phosphorylate β-catenin in intact cells although it has reduced activity. Mutation of Tyr216 to Phe markedly reduces the ability of GSK-3β to phosphorylate and down-regulate β-catenin. In conclusion, we have found that the Arg96 mutant has a dominant-negative effect on GSK-3β-dependent phosphorylation of β-catenin and that targeting of β-catenin for degradation requires prior priming through phosphorylation of Ser45.

In both signaling pathways, GSK-3 is constitutively active and becomes inhibited upon binding of insulin or Wnt ligand to their respective receptors. As a result of insulin signaling, GSK-3 phosphorylates glycogen synthase, and inhibition of GSK-3 leads to accumulation of dephosphorylated, active glycogen synthase, thus leading to stimulation of glycogen synthesis. For Wnt signaling, the primary substrate of GSK-3 is β-catenin. Phosphorylation by GSK-3 targets β-catenin for ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation. Inhibition of GSK-3 thus results in β-catenin stabilization. β-catenin then translocates into the nucleus, where it activates gene transcription in conjunction with transcription factors of the Lef/TCF family (1Dale T.C. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 209-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 2Arias A.M. Brown A.M. Brennan K. Curr. Opin. Genet.

Dev. 2000; 10: 508-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar).GSK-3 activity toward cellular substrates can be regulated at several levels, including serine and tyrosine phosphorylation of GSK-3 and interaction of GSK-3 with other proteins in multiprotein complexes, as well as priming of substrates through an independent phosphorylation event (4Frame S. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar).Upon binding of insulin to its receptor, Akt/protein kinase B is activated through a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent cascade and phosphorylates GSK-3 at an N-terminal serine (Ser21 in GSK-3α and Ser9 in GSK-3β), resulting in inhibition of its activity (5Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4324) Google Scholar).It has been shown recently that the phosphorylated N terminus of GSK-3 acts as a competitive pseudosubstrate that occupies the substrate binding site of GSK-3 (6Dajani R. Fraser E. Roe S.M. Young N. Good V. Dale T.C. Pearl L.H. Cell. 2001; 105: 721-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar,7Frame S. Cohen P. Biondi R.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1321-1327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). In addition to the N-terminal serine, the activity of GSK-3 is modulated through phosphorylation of a tyrosine residue (Tyr279 in GSK-3α and Tyr216 in GSK-3β). Tyrosine phosphorylation leads to increased GSK-3 activity, and mutation of the tyrosine to phenylalanine reduces its activity in vitro as well as in cells, as assessed by inhibition of c-Jun activity by GSK-3 (8Hughes K. Nikolakaki E. Plyte S.E. Totty N.F. Woodgett J.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 803-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear whether tyrosine phosphorylation of GSK-3 plays a regulatory role under physiological conditions. For instance, tyrosine phosphorylation does not change in response to growth factors (9Shaw M. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 307-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The identity of the kinase responsible for the tyrosine phosphorylation event is not known, although it has been suggested that this may be an autophosphorylation event (4Frame S. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar).In contrast to insulin signaling, phosphorylation of the N-terminal serine is not involved in Wnt-mediated inhibition of GSK-3 (10Ding V.W. Chen R.H. McCormick F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32475-32481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). In the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, GSK-3 activity is regulated through interaction with binding partners in multiprotein complexes. These complexes include β-catenin, the scaffold protein Axin, and APC, the product of the adenomatous polyposis coli gene.Both Axin and APC are required for GSK-3-mediated phosphorylation of β-catenin and are also substrates for GSK-3 (11Ikeda S. Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Murai H. Koyama S. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1371-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar, 12Rubinfeld B. Albert I. Porfiri E. Fiol C. Munemitsu S. Polakis P. Science. 1996; 272: 1023-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Axin by GSK-3 stabilizes the protein (13Yamamoto H. Kishida S. Kishida M. Ikeda S. Takada S. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10681-10684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) and facilitates the binding between Axin and β-catenin (14Jho E.-H. Lomvardas S. Costantini F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 28-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 15Willert K. Shibamoto S. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1768-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of APC by GSK-3 also facilitates its interaction with β-catenin (12Rubinfeld B. Albert I. Porfiri E. Fiol C. Munemitsu S. Polakis P. Science. 1996; 272: 1023-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar, 16Salic A. Lee E. Mayer L. Kirschner M.W. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 523-532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Thus, phosphorylation of both Axin and APC by GSK-3 promotes the formation and stabilization of the β-catenin degradation complex. Wnt signaling is transmitted via Dishevelled, which is recruited into the β-catenin degradation complex, resulting in inhibition of GSK-3-mediated phosphorylation and stabilization of β-catenin. In addition, it has been suggested that the GSK-3-binding protein GBP/FRAT also transmits the Wnt signal (16Salic A. Lee E. Mayer L. Kirschner M.W. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 523-532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 17Li L. Yuan H. Weaver C.D. Mao J. Farr 3rd, G.H. Sussman D.J. Jonkers J. Kimelman D. Wu D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4233-4240Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). FRAT has been shown to compete with Axin for binding at the same or overlapping binding site in GSK-3 (18Thomas G.M. Frame S. Goedert M. Nathke I. Polakis P. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 458: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar,19Culbert A.A. Brown M.J. Frame S. Hagen T. Cross D.A. Bax B. Reith A.D. FEBS Lett. 2001; 507: 288-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and so would be expected to disrupt the interaction between GSK-3 and Axin that is required for the phosphorylation of β-catenin. GBP/FRAT inhibits GSK-3 selectively only toward specific substrates such as β-catenin and Tau, while not affecting phosphorylation of other substrates such as glycogen synthase, eukaryotic initiation factor 2B (eIF2B), and the cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) peptide (18Thomas G.M. Frame S. Goedert M. Nathke I. Polakis P. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 458: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 19Culbert A.A. Brown M.J. Frame S. Hagen T. Cross D.A. Bax B. Reith A.D.

Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 691-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar).Additionally, utilization of substrates by GSK-3 can be regulated by prior phosphorylation of the substrates. This occurs through phosphorylation at a serine or threonine residue four amino acids C-terminal to the GSK-3 phosphorylation site (4Frame S. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar). For example, glycogen synthase can be primed by CK2 at Ser656 (21Parker P.J. Caudwell F.B. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 130: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), which facilitates GSK-3-mediated phosphorylation at Ser652, followed by phosphorylation of Ser648, Ser644, and then Ser640. A similar motif in β-catenin (Ser29-X 3-Ser33-X 3-Ser37-X 3-Thr41-X 3-Ser45) is known to be phosphorylated by GSK-3. However, no priming kinase has been identified, and it is at present unclear whether phosphorylation of β-catenin by GSK-3 requires priming (22Harwood A.J. Cell. 2001; 105: 821-824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Binding of the F-box protein β-TrCP, a component of the E3 ubiquitin ligase, which results in targeting of β-catenin for proteasome-mediated degradation, is dependent on the phosphorylation of Ser33 and Ser37 (23Aberle H. Bauer A. Stappert J. Kispert A. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3797-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (2133) Google Scholar, 24Orford K. Crockett C. Jensen J.P. Weissman A.M. Byers S.W. J. Biol.

Mutation of these Ser residues in cell lines and in human patients bearing colon and other carcinomas has been shown to result in β-catenin stabilization (26Yost C. Torres M. Miller J.R. Huang E.

Science. 1997; 275: 1790-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar). Likewise, mutations of Thr41 or Ser45 prevent β-catenin degradation (27Morin P.J. Sparks A.B. Korinek V. Barker N.

Carcinogenesis. 2001; 22: 1885-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This suggests that phosphorylation of both Thr41 and Ser45 is required for phosphorylation of the two Ser residues within the β-TrCP recognition element and that, like glycogen synthase, β-catenin is phosphorylated by GSK-3 in a sequential manner beginning from the C terminus of the consensus sequence.Recently, the crystal structure of GSK-3β was determined, and it was demonstrated that the phosphorylated priming site of the substrate interacts with three positive residues in GSK-3β, Arg96, Arg180, and Lys205, which form a binding pocket for the priming phosphate (6Dajani R.

Brown M.J. Smith D.G. Reith A.D. Structure. 2001; 9: 1143-1152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Mutation of one of those positive residues, Arg96 to Ala, has been shown to prevent phosphorylation of primed substrates by GSK-3 (7Frame S. Cohen P. Biondi R.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1321-1327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). GSK-3 is also known to be able to phosphorylate unprimed substrates in vitro, albeit with lower activity. Interestingly, mutation of Arg96 did not affect GSK-3-mediated phosphorylation of unprimed substrates in vitro (7Frame S. Cohen P. Biondi R.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1321-1327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Thus, the Arg96 mutant was unable to phosphorylate glycogen synthase or primed glycogen synthase-derived peptide in vitro but was able to phosphorylate non-primed glycogen synthase-derived peptide as efficiently as wild type GSK-3 (7Frame S. Cohen P. Biondi R.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1321-1327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). The Arg96 mutant was shown to completely retain the ability to phosphorylate β-catenin and Axin in vitro (7Frame S. Cohen P. Biondi R.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1321-1327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a phospho-octapeptide derived from the N terminus of GSK-3β, which interacts with the binding site for the priming phosphate, did not impair the phosphorylation of β-catenin and Axin in vitro (7Frame S. Cohen P. Biondi R.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1321-1327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). This suggests that the binding site for the priming phosphate is not required for phosphorylation of β-catenin by GSK-3 in the Wnt signaling pathway. Frame et al. (7Frame S. Cohen P. Biondi R.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1321-1327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar) also identified a residue, Leu128, that is required for the phosphorylation of Axin in vitro. Mutation of Leu128 to Ala, however, did not impair the ability of GSK-3 to phosphorylate primed substrates.Although many cell types are responsive to both the insulin and Wnt signals, there is generally no cross-talk between the two pathways. The specificity is likely to be maintained through the interaction with different binding partners and compartmentalization of GSK-3 within the cell (22Harwood A.J. Cell. 2001; 105: 821-824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). In addition, cross-talk may also be prevented as a result of different substrate characteristics in the two signaling pathways. Thus, primed and unprimed substrates may be affected differentially by inhibition of GSK-3 through phosphorylation of the N-terminal serine or through interaction with GBP/FRAT, as has been shown in vitro (18Thomas G.M. Frame S. Goedert M. Nathke I. Polakis P. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 458: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 20Farr 3rd, G.H. Ferkey D.M. Yost C. Pierce S.B. Weaver C. Kimelman D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 691-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear at present whether β-catenin is an unprimed or primed substrate in vivo and whether these mechanisms are likely to play a role in achieving specificity of the two signaling cascades.In this study we have investigated the mechanism of the phosphorylation of β-catenin by GSK-3 in intact cells. Our data support a sequential phosphorylation of β-catenin beginning at the C terminus that is dependent on the prior phosphorylation of Ser45. The Arg96 mutant GSK-3β (which is unable to phosphorylate primed substrates) but not kinase-inactive GSK-3β has a dominant-negative effect on β-catenin phosphorylation.DISCUSSIONThe aim of this study was to gain insight into the regulation of the GSK-3β-mediated phosphorylation of β-catenin in cells. In particular, conflicting data have been reported with respect to the requirement of priming phosphorylation on β-catenin to facilitate its utilization as a GSK-3 substrate. In glycogen synthase, GSK-3 phosphorylates the four N-terminal serines in the motif Ser640-X 3-Ser644-X 3-Ser648-X 3-Ser652-X3 -Ser656(21Parker P.J. Caudwell F.B. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 130: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of these serines by GSK-3 is sequential from the C to the N terminus and is dependent on prior phosphorylation of Ser656 by CK2. GSK-3β is known to phosphorylate a similar motif in β-catenin: Ser33-X 3-Ser37-X 3-Thr41-X 3-Ser45. Although only Ser33 and Ser37 are part of the recognition motif for binding of β-TrCP to β-catenin, mutations of all of these serine and threonine residues, including Thr41and Ser45, are known to stabilize β-catenin and to be associated with various cancers (27Morin P.J. Sparks A.B. Korinek V. Barker N. Clevers H. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1997; 275: 1787-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3480) Google Scholar, 28Rubinfeld B. Robbins P., El- Gamil M. Albert I.

Carcinogenesis. 2001; 22: 1885-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This suggests that, like glycogen synthase, β-catenin is phosphorylated in a sequential manner beginning at the C terminus. However, it has been shown in vitro that phosphorylation of β-catenin by GSK-3 does not require priming. Consistent with this, the R96A mutant of GSK-3β was shown in vitro to phosphorylate β-catenin as efficiently as the wild type enzyme (7Frame S. Cohen P. Biondi R.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1321-1327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar).Here we have used this mutant to investigate the mechanism of GSK-3-mediated phosphorylation of β-catenin in intact cells. In contrast to in vitro studies, we have found that the R96A mutant prevents GSK-3-mediated phosphorylation and degradation of β-catenin. Furthermore, mutation of Ser45 in β-catenin to Ala prevented phosphorylation of the Thr41, Ser37, and Ser33 residues in β-catenin. These results indicate that like glycogen synthase β-catenin is phosphorylated in a sequential manner, beginning at the C terminus, in cellular systems. If Ser45 is phosphorylated, R96A GSK-3β is unable to catalyze the phosphorylation of Thr41 because the substrate is primed. Consequently the mutant enzyme acts as a dominant-negative. It is presently unclear whether priming of β-catenin through phosphorylation of Ser45 is mediated by GSK-3 itself or by a different kinase.We have also found that the L128A mutant of GSK-3β was able to phosphorylate β-catenin in intact cells, although its activity was reduced compared with wild type enzyme. The Leu128 mutant has been reported to be deficient in phosphorylating, but not in binding, Axin in vitro while retaining the ability to phosphorylate primed substrates (7Frame S. Cohen P. Biondi R.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1321-1327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). The ability of the Leu128 mutant to phosphorylate β-catenin in intact cells would thus be in agreement with the mechanism of β-catenin phosphorylation by GSK-3. The reduced activity of L128A mutant GSK-3β may be due to impaired GSK-3-dependent phosphorylation of Axin and/or APC, which has been shown to promote the formation and stabilization of the β-catenin degradation complex (12Rubinfeld B. Albert I. Porfiri E. Fiol C. Munemitsu S. Polakis P. Science. 1996; 272: 1023-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar, 14Jho E.-H. Lomvardas S. Costantini F. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Thus, reduced phosphorylation of β-catenin by the L128A mutant may result from destabilization of the β-catenin signaling complex.In contrast to the R96A mutant, we have found that kinase-inactive GSK-3β was unable to act as a dominant-negative in signaling to β-catenin. Although there are several reports showing dominant-negative effects of kinase-inactive GSK-3 in Wnt signaling inXenopus (26Yost C. Torres M. Miller J.R. Huang E. Kimelman D. Moon R.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1443-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar, 33Pierce S.B. Kimelman D. Development. 1995; 121: 755-765Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34He X. Saint-Jeannet J.P.

A. 1995; 92: 8498-8502Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), activation of the Wnt signaling pathway by kinase-inactive GSK-3 in a mammalian cell system has been reported only in a study by Staal et al. (36Staal F.J. Burgering B.M. van de Wetering M. Clevers H.C. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). That study found that kinase-inactive GSK-3β and lithium activate β-catenin-dependent Tcf-1-mediated transcription in C57MG but not in Jurkat T cells. GSK-3 does not bind β-catenin directly but requires interaction with Axin and APC to phosphorylate β-catenin. It is possible that the dominant-negative activity is dependent on the interaction with Axin, because kinase-inactive GSK-3 has been shown to be unable to interact with Axin (11Ikeda S. Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Murai H. Koyama S. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1371-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar, 37Zhang Y. Qiu W.J. Liu D.X. Neo S.Y., He, X. Lin S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32152-32159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This implies that the interaction of GSK-3 with Axin is dependent on its kinase activity. Because Axin may be an unprimed substrate for GSK-3 (7Frame S. Cohen P. Biondi R.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1321-1327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar), it is possible that the R96A mutant retains the ability to phosphorylate and bind Axin. This would allow access for the R96A mutant, but not kinase-inactive, GSK-3 into the β-catenin degradation complex. Thus, only R96A mutant, but not kinase-inactive, GSK-3, would be able to compete with endogenous GSK-3.Finally, as expected, we have shown that mutation of Ser9to Ala did not affect GSK-3β-mediated phosphorylation of β-catenin, whereas mutation of Tyr216 to Phe markedly reduced the phosphorylation of β-catenin in intact cells. These findings are consistent with other studies, in which tyrosine phosphorylation has been shown to increase the activity of GSK-3β toward various substrates in vitro and in intact cells, including c-Jun (8Hughes K. Nikolakaki E. Plyte S.E. Totty N.F. Woodgett J.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 803-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar) and Tau (38Hartigan J.A. Johnson G.V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21395-21401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation is also required for GSK-3β-dependent phosphorylation of β-catenin, although it is not clear whether it may serve a regulatory role in the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.In conclusion, this study shows that phosphorylation of β-catenin at Ser33, Ser37, and Thr41 in intact cells requires priming through phosphorylation of Ser45. The Arg96 mutant, which is unable to phosphorylate primed substrates, but not kinase-inactive GSK3β, has a dominant-negative effect on the phosphorylation of β-catenin. Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3)1 is a serine-threonine kinase that is involved in both insulin and Wnt signaling. In both signaling pathways, GSK-3 is constitutively active and becomes inhibited upon binding of insulin or Wnt ligand to their respective receptors. As a result of insulin signaling, GSK-3 phosphorylates glycogen synthase, and inhibition of GSK-3 leads to accumulation of dephosphorylated, active glycogen synthase, thus leading to stimulation of glycogen synthesis. For Wnt signaling, the primary substrate of GSK-3 is β-catenin. Phosphorylation by GSK-3 targets β-catenin for ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation. Inhibition of GSK-3 thus results in β-catenin stabilization. β-catenin then translocates into the nucleus, where it activates gene transcription in conjunction with transcription factors of the Lef/TCF family (1Dale T.C. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 209-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 2Arias A.M. Brown A.M. Brennan K. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 447-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 3Kim L. Kimmel A.R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 508-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). GSK-3 activity toward cellular substrates can be regulated at several levels, including serine and tyrosine phosphorylation of GSK-3 and interaction of GSK-3 with other proteins in multiprotein complexes, as well as priming of substrates through an independent phosphorylation event (4Frame S. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar). Upon binding of insulin to its receptor, Akt/protein kinase B is activated through a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent cascade and phosphorylates GSK-3 at an N-terminal serine (Ser21 in GSK-3α and Ser9 in GSK-3β), resulting in inhibition of its activity (5Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4324) Google Scholar).It has been shown recently that the phosphorylated N terminus of GSK-3 acts as a competitive pseudosubstrate that occupies the substrate binding site of GSK-3 (6Dajani R. Fraser E. Roe S.M. Young N. Good V. Dale T.C. Pearl L.H. Cell. 2001; 105: 721-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar,7Frame S. Cohen P. Biondi R.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1321-1327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). In addition to the N-terminal serine, the activity of GSK-3 is modulated through phosphorylation of a tyrosine residue (Tyr279 in GSK-3α and Tyr216 in GSK-3β). Tyrosine phosphorylation leads to increased GSK-3 activity, and mutation of the tyrosine to phenylalanine reduces its activity in vitro as well as in cells, as assessed by inhibition of c-Jun activity by GSK-3 (8Hughes K. Nikolakaki E. Plyte S.E. Totty N.F. Woodgett J.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 803-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear whether tyrosine phosphorylation of GSK-3 plays a regulatory role under physiological conditions. For instance, tyrosine phosphorylation does not change in response to growth factors (9Shaw M. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 307-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2107681829,"We have cloned ClC-3B, a novel alternative splicing variant of ClC-3 (ClC-3A) that is expressed predominantly in epithelial cells. ClC-3B has a different, slightly longer C-terminal end than ClC-3A and contains a consensus motif for binding to the second PDZ (PSD95/Dlg/ZO-1) domain of the epithelium-specific scaffolding protein EBP50. Both in vitro and in vivo binding assays demonstrate interaction between ClC-3B and EBP50. C127 mouse mammary epithelial cells transfected with ClC-3B alone showed diffuse immunoreactivity for ClC-3B in the cytoplasmic region. In contrast, when EBP50 was cotransfected with ClC-3B, strong immunoreactivity for ClC-3B appeared at the leading edges of membrane ruffles. Patch-clamp experiments revealed that cotransfection of ClC-3B and EBP50 resulted in a remarkable increase in outwardly rectifying Cl- channel (ORCC) activities at the leading edges of membrane ruffles in C127 cells. The electrophysiological properties of the ClC-3B-induced ORCCs are similar to those of ORCCs described in native epithelial cells. When cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) was cotransfected with ClC-3B and EBP50, ClC-3B-dependent ORCCs were activated via the protein kinase A-dependent pathway. These findings indicate that ClC-3B is itself a CFTR-regulated ORCC molecule or its activator."

The inhibition of cyp7a gene expression by bile acids is accomplished via an indirect mechanism that involves a nuclear factor that interferes with gene transcription (3Lu T.T. Makishima M. Repa J.J.

Very little is known regarding the regulation of the gene encoding the human cyp7a (CYP7A1), particularly under non-pathological conditions. In this report, we describe the creation of a new mouse model that uniquely expresses the human CYP7A1 gene in the liver. We used this model to evaluate the response of the human CYP7A1 gene to regulation by dietary cholesterol in the intact animal, in an effort to gain insight into the mechanisms that regulate human CYP7A1 gene expression in vivo. Transgenic mice were produced by injecting an entire bacterial artificial chromosome (∼125 kb) containing the human CYP7A1 gene into C57BL/6×CBA zygotes using standard procedures. The injected CYP7A1 gene was flanked by >17 kb and >6 kb of sequence at the 5′ and 3′ regions, respectively. Incorporation of the CYP7A1 gene into the genomes of mice born from injected eggs was assessed by screening of tail DNA by PCR analysis using CYP7A1 gene-specific primers (sense, 5′-TCTGAACTTGATCACCGTCTCTCTG-3′; antisense, 5′-GTCGACCAAATCTAGGCCAAAATCT-3′) and confirmed by DNA blot analysis. The murine Mos gene (9Wood T.G. McGeady M.L. Baroudy B.M. Blair D.G. Vande Woude G.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 24: 7817-7821Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar) served as the internal control target in the PCR analyses (sense, 5′-TCAGATTTGTGCATACACAGTGACT-3′; antisense, 5′-ACTCAACTTTTATTCCCGAAAAATGTTTCA-3′) of mouse genomic DNA. Transgenic mice were crossed with C57BL6/J mice, and the resulting F1 generation was analyzed for transgene inheritance and expression. The human CYP7A1 gene was detected by DNA blotting using the rat cyp7a cDNA as a probe. The human cyp7a mRNA was detected in total liver RNA (see below for details), and the human cyp7a enzyme was detected by immunoblotting using rabbit antiserum directed against the last five carboxyl-terminal amino acid residues of human cyp7a. The CYP7A1 transgenic mouse line in which the human cyp7a mRNA and enzyme could be detected unequivocally was expanded. A male transgenic mouse from the F2 generation was used to breed the CYP7A1 transgene into female Cyp7a1 −/− mice obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). The F1 progeny of this cross were interbred to produce F2 CYP7A1 transgenic mice that were also homozygous for the disrupted Cyp7a1 allele. Zygosity to the mutant Cyp7a1 allele was evaluated by PCR analysis using a primer pair (IMR013, 5′-CTTGGGTGGAGAGGCTATTC-3′; IMR014, 5′-AGGTGAGATGACAGGAGATC-3′) specific for the neomycin phosphotransferase gene (neo r) that is embedded in the disrupted Cyp7a1 allele and a primer pair (IMR594, 5′-GATGTATGCCTTCTGCTACCG-3′; IMR595, 5′-TCACAAGGTGCGTCTTAGCC-3′) specific for a segment of the wild type Cyp7a1 gene that is absent in the mutant Cyp7a1 allele. The IMR primers described above are documented in the Induced Mutation Resource at the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). One male and one female mouse from the F3 generation, bearing the desired genotype, were crossed to generate the line used in this study. The mice (both sexes) were fed a standard chow diet (Purina Rodent Chow 5001) or, where indicated, the chow diet supplemented with 1% (w/w) cholesterol for 14 days. The use of animals in this study was approved by the University of Alberta Health Sciences Animal Welfare and Policy Committee. RNA was purified from tissues according to a standard procedure (10Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (63088) Google Scholar). Complementary DNA was synthesized from 10 μg of total RNA with Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen Canada, Inc., Burlington, Ontario, Canada) following the manufacturer's suggested protocol. The human cyp7a mRNA was detected by RT-PCR using species-specific and intron-spanning primers (sense, 5′-AGAAGGCAAACGGGTGAACC-3′; antisense, 5′-GGGTCAATGCTTCTGTGCCC) and by high stringency RNA blotting using the 3′-untranslated region of the human cyp7a cDNA as a probe. The cyclophilin mRNA served as the internal control target in the PCR analysis using intron-spanning primers (sense, 5′-TCCAAAGACAGCAGAAAACTTTCG-3′; antisense, 5′-TCTTCTTGCTGGTCTTGCCATTCC-3′). Murine AbcA1 mRNA was detected by RT-PCR using intron spanning primers (sense, 5′-GACGATATCTCGATTCATGG-3′; antisense, 5′-CACGTTGTCAATGTCCATCC-3′). The relative abundance of mRNA species of interest was determined by quantitative real-time PCR. Polymerase chain reactions were done with REDTaq DNA polymerase (Sigma-Aldrich) and intron-spanning, gene-specific oligonucleotides as described above in the presence of 1× SYBR Green I (supplied as a 10,000× stock; Sigma-Aldrich). The annealing temperature of each oligonucleotide pair was preoptimized using a T- Gradient thermal cycler (Whatman Biometra, Göttingen, Germany) to ensure the synthesis of only the expected amplicon. Quantitative synthesis of the amplicons was monitored by green fluorescence using a LightCycler (Roche Diagnostics Canada, Laval, Quebec, Canada). The range of cycle numbers in which amplification remained linear was also predetermined. The mass of amplicons synthesized was quantitated using the LightCycler software package (Roche Diagnostics Canada). Cyclophilin mRNA was used as the internal standard, and its abundance varied less than 10% among all samples analyzed. All reactions were confirmed visually by agarose gel electrophoresis. Culture conditions for McArdle RH7777 cells, the transfection procedure, and the structures of the human and murine cyp7a promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene chimeras (hCYP7A1.CAT and mCyp7a1.CAT, respectively) were described previously (11Cheema S.K. Agellon L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12530-12536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Cultures (60-mm dishes, 60% confluent) were transfected with a mixture of plasmids containing a cyp7a-CAT gene chimera (1 μg), expression plasmids encoding LXRα (0.5 μg, pCMX-LXRα), RXRα (0.5 μg, pSG5-RXRα), and β-galactosidase (pCH110; 5 μg). Sonicated salmon sperm DNA was added to the mixture to give a mass of 10 μg of DNA added per dish. The 25-hydroxycholesterol (dissolved in ethanol; Sigma-Aldrich) was used as the activator of LXRα (at 5 μm final concentration). Controls received an equivalent amount of ethanol. The β-galactosidase activity encoded by pCH110 was used to normalize transfection efficiency. Recombinant LXRα and RXR were produced in Escherichia coli and partially purified. The cyp7a Site I sequences (human, 5′-TTGTCAACCAAGCTCA-3′; murine, 5′-TGGTCACCCAAGTTCA-3′) were described previously (11Cheema S.K. Agellon L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12530-12536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probes contained overhangs (5′-AATT-3′), which allowed radiolabeling with 32P-labeled deoxyribonucleotides by fill-in reaction catalyzed by the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I. The probe and recombinant receptors (100 ng) were incubated with 4 μg of poly(dI:dC), 4 μg of bovine serum albumin, 1 μg of sonicated salmon sperm DNA in binding buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 4 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm dithiothreitol) for 20 min at room temperature in a total volume of 40 μl. In competition binding experiments, a double-stranded oligonucleotide bearing an idealized LXR binding site (5′-AGTTCACTCAAGTTCA-3′) was added to the binding reactions prior to the addition of radiolabeled Site I probes. DNA-protein complexes were separated from unbound probe by electrophoresis on a 4% polyacrylamide gel and visualized by phosphorimaging using a Bio-Rad Molecular Imager FX Pro Plus MultiImager System. Conditions for the assay of cyp7a enzyme activity were described previously (12Agellon L.B. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 75: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We obtained nine mice from injected fertilized eggs that had incorporated the transgene into their genomes, and five of these transmitted the transgene to their offspring (see Supplemental Table I for details). The human cyp7a mRNA was detectable in only three of the five lines. One of these lines produced very small litters and was not bred further. The human cyp7a mRNA and enzyme (Fig. 1, A and B, respectively) were unequivocally detectable in only one (line M49) of the two remaining lines, and this was selected to establish a colony. The F3 generation was produced by crossing two hemizygous transgenic mice. The human CYP7A1 transgene was subsequently transferred to the Cyp7a1 −/− background by crossing a transgenic male mouse from the F3 generation with female Cyp7a1 −/− mice. The progeny of this cross were heterozygous for the disrupted Cyp7a1 allele, and all contained the human CYP7A1 transgene. As shown in Fig. 2 A, both the human CYP7A1 gene and the disrupted murine Cyp7a1 gene hybridization patterns (left and right lanes, respectively) are evident in the progeny of this cross (middle lane). A male and female mouse from this generation were mated to reestablish homozygosity to the disrupted Cyp7a1 allele. From the progeny of this cross, one male and one female mouse, which carried the desired genotype, were selected to establish the second colony. Fig. 2 B shows the genotype analysis of Cyp7a1−/− mice carrying the human CYP7A1 transgene (hereafter referred to as hCYP7A1 mice). As can be seen (Fig. 2 B, lane 5), the human CYP7A1 transgene is clearly detectable, and the wild type Cyp7a1 allele has been replaced with the disrupted Cyp7a1 allele. Expression of the human CYP7A1 transgene in Cyp7a1 −/− mice reversed postnatal lethality observed in Cyp7a1 −/− mice (13Ishibashi S. Schwarz M. Frykman P.K. Herz J. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18017-18023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The hCYP7A1 pups were overtly indistinguishable from wild type pups and survived to weaning without supplementing the standard diet of nursing mothers with bile acids or fat-soluble vitamins. Liver expression of the CYP7A1 transgene in mice possessing the wild type Cyp7a1 gene was reported earlier (14Goodart S.A. Huynh C. Chen W. Cooper A.D. Levy-Wilson B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 454-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), but the tissue distribution was not determined. Thus, we surveyed the distribution of CYP7A1 transgene expression in hCYP7A1 mice. As shown in Fig. 2 C, the human cyp7a mRNA is detectable only in the liver. This result demonstrates that the liver-specific expression of the human CYP7A1 gene is faithfully reproduced in the murine species. The stimulation of the murine Cyp7a1 gene expression by dietary cholesterol is well documented (8Peet D.J. Turley S.D., Ma, W. Janowski B.A. Lobaccaro J.-M. A. Hammer R.E. Mangelsdorf D.J.

Thus, we compared the expression of the CYP7A1 transgene in mice fed the standard chow diet or the chow diet supplemented with 1% cholesterol for 14 days. Although the Cyp7a1 −/− mice do not synthesize the cyp7a enzyme, the disrupted murine Cyp7a1 allele continues to be transcribed producing an mRNA species that is a composed of cyp7a and neo r sequences (13Ishibashi S. Schwarz M. Frykman P.K. Herz J. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18017-18023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The changes in the abundance of the chimeric murine cyp7a/neor mRNA in response to cholesterol feeding were also monitored. As shown in Fig. 3 A, the murine cyp7a/neo r mRNA was increased by 40% (p < 0.0005) in hCYP7A1 mice. This rise in cyp7a/neo r is in agreement with the expected response of the murine Cyp7a1 gene to dietary cholesterol. In contrast, the abundance of the human cyp7a mRNA was decreased by 56% (p < 0.005). The Abca1 gene is expressed in the liver (17Qiu Y. Cavelier L. Chiu S. Yang X. Rubin E. Cheng J.F. Genomics. 2001; 73: 66-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and is known to be stimulated by oxysterols (18Repa J.J. Turley S.D. Lobaccaro J.A. Medina J., Li, L. Lustig K. Shan B. Heyman R.A. Dietschy J.M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Science. 2000; 289: 1524-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar). A 7.8-fold rise (p < 0.006) in AbcA1 mRNA abundance in total liver RNA of cholesterol-fed versus chow-fed hCYP7A1 mice was evident (Fig. 3 B). Although it is not clear which hepatic cell type expresses the Abca1 gene, the result is nevertheless consistent with the exposure of the liver of cholesterol-fed mice to the dietary cholesterol. The hepatic cyp7a enzyme activity of chow-fed hCYP7A1 mice is lower than that of chow-fed wild type mice, which may be due to the lower level of human CYP7A1 transgene expression relative to that of the murine Cyp7a1 gene in wild type mice. The cholesterol diet decreased hepatic cyp7a enzyme activity by 55% (p < 0.02) in hCYP7A1 mice, concomitant with the fall of human cyp7a mRNA abundance (Fig. 3 C). These results clearly illustrate the failure of dietary cholesterol to stimulate human CYP7A1 transgene expression in mice. The apparent repression of human CYP7A1 gene expression by dietary cholesterol was unexpected, and the basis for this is not clear. It is evident that, in intact animals, the human CYP7A1 and murine Cyp7a1 genes respond differently to dietary cholesterol. The findings obtained in vivo were verified in hepatoma cells. It is known that oxysterols regulate the activity of responsive promoters by activating nuclear receptors known as the LXR, which are bound to response elements as heterodimers with RXRs (6Janowski B.A. Willy P.J. Devi T.R. Falck J.R. Mangelsdorf D.J. Nature. 1996; 383: 728-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1445) Google Scholar). The murine Cyp7a1 gene promoter contains an LXR:RXR binding site (termed Site I; Fig. 4 A) (11Cheema S.K. Agellon L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12530-12536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), which is similar in sequence to the rat Cyp7a1 LXR binding site (19Chiang J.Y. Kimmel R. Stroup D. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 262: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). In addition, the inactivation of the murine gene encoding the LXRα isoform results in the resistance of the Cyp7a1 gene to stimulation by dietary cholesterol (8Peet D.J. Turley S.D., Ma, W. Janowski B.A. Lobaccaro J.-M. A. Hammer R.E. Mangelsdorf D.J. Cell. 1998; 93: 693-704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar). Thus, we compared the response of the human and murine gene promoters to oxysterol-activated LXRα:RXR. Fig. 4 B shows a 30-fold increase (p < 0.001) in reporter activity from the murine mCyp7a1.CAT gene chimera when LXRα was activated by 25-hydroxycholesterol, whereas no response was evident from the human hCYP7A1.CAT gene chimera. A similar finding for the human CYP7A1 gene promoter was also documented in HepG2 cells (19Chiang J.Y. Kimmel R. Stroup D. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 262: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Analysis of recombinant LXRα:RXR interaction with human and murine Site I by electrophoretic mobility shift assay demonstrated avid binding of the heterodimer to the murine Site I, but no detectable binding to the human Site I was found (Fig. 4 C). Moreover, the binding of LXRα:RXR to the murine Site I could be efficiently competed by an idealized LXRα:RXR binding site, illustrating the specificity of the interaction. These results demonstrate that the human and murine Site I sequence dictates the interaction of the LXRα:RXR with the human and murine cyp7a gene promoter and subsequently their response to cholesterol. We surveyed the sequence of the Site I in a small cohort of unrelated individuals from different ethnic backgrounds. This analysis revealed that the human Site I sequence was invariant (Supplemental Fig. 1), implying a similar general response of the human CYP7A1 gene to transcriptional control at this regulatory site. In summary, we have described the creation of a mouse strain that uniquely expresses the human cyp7a enzyme in the liver. This model has permitted us to evaluate the response of the human CYP7A1 gene to dietary cholesterol in the intact animal, under the same conditions normally used to study murine Cyp7a1 gene expression but without interference from the functional consequences of the endogenous Cyp7a1 gene. The results obtained demonstrate that the human CYP7A1 gene is not stimulated by dietary cholesterol in vivo. Previously we showed that the murine Cyp7A1 gene promoter is induced by fats more robustly compared with the human CYP7A1 gene promoter in hepatoma cells (11Cheema S.K. Agellon L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12530-12536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We have also found that the activity of the human CYP7A1 gene promoter is repressed by thyroid hormone (20Drover V.A. Wong N.C. Agellon L.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 14-23PubMed Google Scholar), contrary to the response described for murine and rat Cyp7a1 gene promoters (21Ness G.C. Pendleton L.C., Li, Y.C. Chiang J.Y.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 172: 1150-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 22Hylemon P.B. Gurley E.C. Stravitz R.T. Litz J.S. Pandak W.M. Chiang J.Y. Vlahcevic Z.R. J. Biol.

These findings may be illustrating a fundamental difference in the way the human CYP7A1 and murine Cyp7a1 genes are normally regulated in vivo.

https://openalex.org/W1998129838,"ADAM13 is a member of the disintegrinand metalloprotease protein family that is expressed on cranial neural crest cells surface and is essential for their migration. ADAM13 is an active protease that can cleave fibronectin in vitro and remodel a fibronectin substratein vivo. Using a recombinant secreted protein containing both disintegrin and cysteine-rich domains of ADAM13, we show that this “adhesive” region of the protein binds directly to fibronectin. Fibronectin fusion proteins corresponding to the various functional domains were used to define the second heparin-binding domain as the ADAM13 binding site. Mutation of the syndecan-binding site (PPRR → PPTM) within this domain abolishes binding of the recombinant disintegrin and cysteine-rich domains of ADAM13. We further show that the adhesive disintegrin and cysteine-rich domain of ADAM13 can promote cell adhesion via β1 integrins. This adhesion requires integrin activation and can be prevented by antibodies to the cysteine-rich domain of ADAM13 and β1 integrin. Finally, wild type, but not the E/A mutant of ADAM13 metalloprotease domain, can be shed from the cell surface, releasing the metalloprotease domain associated with the disintegrin and cysteine-rich domains. This suggests that ADAM13 shedding may involve its own metalloprotease activity and that the released protease may interact with both integrins and extracellular matrix proteins.

Primakoff P. Myles D.G. White J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 275-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). To date, 33 ADAMs have been identified in worms, insects, amphibians, and mammals (2White J.M. Bigler D. Chen M. Wolfsberg T.G. Beckerle M. Cell Adhesion: Frontiers in Molecular Biology. Oxford University Press, Oxford, United Kingdom2001: 189-208Google Scholar). They can be classified in two major subgroups depending on the presence or absence of a putative active site (HEXGHXXGXHD) in the metalloprotease domain (3Black R.A. White J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 654-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). ADAM proteins have been implicated in many biological processes including fertilization (4Myles D.G. Dev.

Biol. 2001; 11: 918-930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Although the number of potential functions involving ADAMs increases, the function of individual ADAM protein domains remains poorly understood. The ADAM metalloprotease domain appears to be involved mostly in shedding cell surface molecules (10Blobel C.P. Cell. 1997; 90: 589-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Among these molecules are growth factors (tumor necrosis factor-α, transforming growth factor-α, heparin binding-epidermal growth factor), other signaling molecules (Notch, Delta, ephrin), and cell adhesion molecules (selectin, L1-Cam). These cleavages allow cells to send and/or receive a signal as well as change their adhesion to the surrounding cells or substrate. Recently, ADAM13 was shown to cleave fibronectin, one of the major components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) that lies in all cell migration pathways (9Alfandari D. Cousin H. Gaultier A. Smith K. White J.M. Darribere T. DeSimone D.W. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 918-930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The disintegrin and cysteine-rich domains compose the adhesive part of the ADAM protein. A small loop within the disintegrin domain, known as the disintegrin loop, can bind to several receptors of the integrin family (11Evans J.P. Bioessays. 2001; 23: 628-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The best example of this is the interaction of ADAM2 and -3 on the mature mouse sperm with the α6β1integrin on the egg surface (12Almeida E.A. Huovila A.P. Sutherland A.E. Stephens L.E. Calarco P.G. Shaw L.M. Mercurio A.M. Sonnenberg A. Primakoff P. Myles D.G. White J.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1095-1104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 13Bigler D. Takahashi Y. Chen M.S.

Cell. 2001; 12 (4): 809-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In vitro studies of cell lines have also shown that recombinant disintegrin domains can serve as adhesive substrates. One characteristic of ADAM binding to integrins is that dissimilar disintegrin loops can bind to the same integrin. This is the case for ADAM2, -3, and -9, which all bind to the α6β1 integrin despite differences in their disintegrin loop sequences (13Bigler D. Takahashi Y. Chen M.S. Almeida E.A. Osbourne L. White J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11576-11584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 14Takahashi Y. Bigler D. Ito Y. White J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12 (4): 809-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 15Nath D. Slocombe P.M. Webster A. Stephens P.E. Docherty A.J. Murphy G. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2319-2328Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This promiscuity makes it hard to predict which disintegrin domain may bind to which integrins. In most of these interactions, the disintegrin domain was shown to be responsible and reagents (antibodies and peptides) to the disintegrin loop were sufficient to interfere with the adhesion. Recently, the ADAM12 cysteine-rich domain was shown to interact with another adhesion molecule, the heparan sulfate proteoglycan syndecan (16Iba K. Albrechtsen R. Gilpin B. Frohlich C. Loechel F. Zolkiewska A. Ishiguro K. Kojima T. Liu W. Langford J.K. Sanderson R.D. Brakebusch C. Fassler R. Wewer U.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1143-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). This shows that both the disintegrin and cysteine-rich domains are potentially adhesive to cell surface proteins. Together with the structural data, this suggests that the disintegrin and cysteine-rich domains may in fact represent one functional entity: the “adhesive” domain. Another level of complexity is that splice variants have been identified for several ADAM proteins. These splice variants encode soluble forms lacking the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain (17Gilpin B.J. Loechel F. Mattei M.G. Engvall E. Albrechtsen R. Wewer U.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 157-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). In most cases the soluble forms contain the metalloprotease domain with or without the inhibitory pro-domain, and the disintegrin and cysteine-rich domains. So far it is unclear how these soluble forms function and whether their specificity is the same as their membrane counterparts. Studies on a closely related family of proteins, the ADAM-TS (soluble proteins containing a disintegrin and a metalloprotease with thrombospondin repeats), may help to elucidate how soluble forms of ADAMs work (18Tang B.L. Hong W. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 223-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). ADAM-TS proteins are secreted and incorporated in the ECM via their thrombospondin repeats (19Kuno K. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13912-13917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). These motifs were initially characterized in the thrombospondin proteins and are known to bind to other components of the ECM. One secreted ADAM-like protein, MIG-17, was shown to influence germinal cell migration in the wormCaenorhabditis elegans (20Nishiwaki K. Hisamoto N. Matsumoto K. Science. 2000; 288: 2205-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The function of the protein was shown to depend on the proteolytic activity and the localization of the protein, via the disintegrin domain, to the basement membrane of the gonads. Similarly, the secreted ADAM12 protein, also called ADAM12 short, was initially reported to bind laminin in a yeast two-hybrid screen (17Gilpin B.J. Loechel F. Mattei M.G. Engvall E. Albrechtsen R. Wewer U.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 157-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). These results suggest that adhesive domain of ADAM may interact with extracellular matrix components in a manner similar to that for thrombospondin repeats in ADAM-TS proteins. Among the various proteins that compose the extracellular matrix, fibronectin is one of the best studied. This large protein promotes cell adhesion and migration as well as signals that are essential for cell survival. Cells use two major families of transmembrane proteins to interact with the various domain of fibronectin. Integrins bind to the central cell-binding domain as well as to the variable (V) region. These receptors are responsible for most of the cell adhesion, cell migration, and cell survival response to fibronectin (21Dzamba B.J. Bolton M.A. DeSimone D.W. Beckerle M. Cell Adhesion: The Integrin Family of Cell Adhesion Molecules. Oxford University Press, Oxford, United Kingdom2002: 100-136Google Scholar, 22Alfandari D. Ramos J. Clavilier L. DeSimone D.W. Darribere T. Mech. Dev. 1996; 56: 83-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 23Darribere T. Skalski M. Cousin H.L. Gaultier A. Montmory C. Alfandari D. Biol. Cell. 2000; 92: 5-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Syndecan-4 is a proteoglycan that has been shown to interact with the second heparin-binding domain (Hep II), which is located just N-terminal to the V-region. This interaction appears to be essential for the formation of stable adhesion structures called focal contacts (24Woods A. Longley R.L. Tumova S. Couchman J.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 374: 66-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). It is striking that the two families of receptors involved in cell binding to fibronectin are also known to interact with ADAM proteins. We have previously shown that ADAM13 can cleave fibronectin in vitro and that cells overexpressing ADAM13, but not those overexpressing a protease-dead point mutant, can remodel a fibronectin substrate (9Alfandari D. Cousin H. Gaultier A. Smith K. White J.M. Darribere T. DeSimone D.W. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 918-930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In this report we show that ADAM13-DC domain can bind to the Hep II domain of fibronectin. We also show that mutation of the syndecan-binding site within this domain is sufficient to abolish ADAM13-DC binding. Cell adhesion assays suggest that the interaction of ADAM13-DC with the Hep II domain of fibronectin does not prevent syndecan binding at this site. Furthermore, DC13 recombinant proteins support cell adhesion via β1-containing integrins. Finally, ADAM13 metalloprotease domain can be shed from the cell surface in association with the disintegrin and cysteine-rich domains (MDC). Altogether, these results suggest that the adhesive (DC) domain of ADAM13 may play a role in binding to one of ADAM13's proteolytic substrates: fibronectin. This interaction may “present” the substrate to the metalloprotease domain or localize the shed MDC to the extracellular matrix. Primers corresponding to the 5′ end of the ADAM13 disintegrin domain, the cysteine-rich domain, the 3′ end of the disintegrin, and the cysteine-rich domains were used in PCR amplification with Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) to generate the different constructs. SpeI and XhoI sites were added to the sense and antisense primers, respectively, for cloning into the pMT/Bip/V5-HisA vector (Invitrogen). The ADAM13 signal sequence was inserted between the BamHI and ClaI sites of CS2-MT (25Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1434-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar) to generate the CS2-SS-MT plasmid. XhoI and XbaI cleavage sites were added to the sense and antisense primers, corresponding to each domain, respectively, for cloning into the CS2-SS-MT plasmid. The mutant mGST-12.15V0 was generated from the original GST-12.15V0 fusion protein (26Ramos J.W. DeSimone D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 227-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. F9 and TKO cell lines were a generous gift of C. Damsky (27Stephens L.E. Sonne J.E. Fitzgerald M.L. Damsky C.H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1607-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). COS-7 (ATCC, CRL1651), F9, and TKO cell lines were grown as a monolayer in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Xenopus XTC cells (28Pudney M. Varma M.G. Leake C.J. Experientia (Basel). 1973; 29: 466-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) were grown in 67% L15 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Drosophila S2 cells (29Schneider I. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1972; 27: 353-365PubMed Google Scholar) were grown in Schneider's insect medium (Biomedia) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum or 10% Prolifix S6 (Biomedia) during protein expression. XTC and COS-7 cells were transfected with the FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche) according to manufacturer's instructions. All media used in this study were supplemented with penicillin (10 IU/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and sodium pyruvate (1 mm). S2 cells were transfected with either pMT/Bip-DC13 or pMT/Bip vector alone using calcium phosphate. Stable lines were established using 300 μg/ml hygromycin B (Invitrogen) in complete insect media. All subsequent steps were carried out in the presence of the selection agent. Transfected cells were stimulated for 3 days (0.5 mmCuSO4) in serum-free Schneider's insect media (Biomedia) supplemented with 10% Prolifix S6 (Biomedia). Cells were spun down for 5 min at 1000 × g, and the conditioned supernatant was collected and filtered through a 0.22-μm filter. Conditioned medium was dialyzed against 100 mm Tris, pH 8, 200 mmNaCl overnight at 4 °C prior to the incubation (overnight) with Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen). The Ni-NTA slurry was washed with 100 bed volumes of 100 mm Tris, pH 8, 300 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 10 mm imidazole, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and with 50 bed volumes of 100 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl. Elution was performed with 100 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 400 mm imidazole. The purified protein was dialyzed against PBS, its concentration was determined by measuring absorbance at 280 nm (ε = 0.62), and the purity of the preparation was estimated by silver staining after SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1 B). This recombinant protein was called D-DC13, as it is produced in theDrosophila S2 cell line. A histidine-tagged fusion protein corresponding to the disintegrin and cysteine-rich domain of X-ADAM13 (myc-DC13) was produced by transient transfection of CS2-SS-MT-DC13 in COS-7 cells. The secreted fusion protein was purified, as described above, from culture supernatant from cells grown in serum-free media complemented with Prolifix S6, using Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen). Monoclonal antibodies 7C9 and 8E8 were obtained, after intraperitoneal injection of BALB/c mice (Jackson Laboratories), using standard techniques (30Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual.

Labeled cells were washed with 100 mm glycine in MBS (XTC) or PBS (COS-7) and extracted with TBS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm EDTA. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. Protein extracts were incubated with streptavidin-agarose (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature, and the unbound fraction was then incubated with concanavalin A-agarose (Vector) overnight at 4 °C. Beads (concanavalin A and streptavidin) were washed three times with TBS plus 1% Triton X-100 and once with TBS. Proteins were eluted in Laemmli buffer, separated on 8% SDS-PAGE, and blotted with the various antibodies as described below. Protein samples with reducing agent (5% β-mercaptoethanol, Sigma) were separated alongside prestained molecular size standards (Bio-Rad) through SDS-PAGE gels (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). Proteins were visualized using 0.2% Ponceau Red in 3% trichloroacetic acid prior to Western blotting. Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS, 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST). Purified antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson) were diluted in the same buffer. Detection was performed using ECL (AmershamBiosciences) and Kodak Biomax films. Purified bovine fibronectin (1 μg, Sigma), EHS-laminin (1 μg, Sigma), type IV collagen (1 μg, Sigma), and BSA (1 μg, Intergen) were spotted onto nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). After staining with 0.2% Ponceau-S in 3% trichloroacetic acid, membranes were blocked for 4 h in TBST, 5% nonfat dry milk and incubated overnight at 4 °C with serum-free culture media conditioned with nontransfected or transfected COS-7 cells expressing the myc-DC13 recombinant protein. Membranes were washed with TBST, 5% nonfat dry milk and incubated with the anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (9E10, Santa Cruz) and with anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody (Jackson). Detection was performed using ECL (Amersham Biosciences) and Kodak Biomax films. GST fusion proteins were purified exactly as described previously (26Ramos J.W. DeSimone D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 227-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Total bacterial protein extracts or purified proteins (10 μg) were mixed with S2 cell culture supernatant containing the D-DC13 recombinant protein and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) were added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Bound proteins were washed three times with PBS supplemented with 250 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and once with TBS, eluted with reducing Laemmli buffer, separated on 12% SDS-PAGE, and blotted with the 7C9 monoclonal antibody (1 μg/ml) as described above. Half of the samples were stained with Coomassie Blue to determine the amount of GST fusion proteins in each sample. Substrates included D-DC13 made in insect S2 cells, Xenopus fibronectin fusion proteins (26Ramos J.W. DeSimone D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 227-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), bovine fibronectin (Sigma), GST, and BSA (Intergen). Falcon Probind 96-well plates were coated with 25 μg/ml substrates in PBS overnight at 4 °C, rinsed with PBS, and blocked with 10 mg/ml BSA in PBS for 2 h at room temperature. Cells (F9 and TKO) were harvested in calcium/magnesium-free PBS containing 0.5 mm EDTA, using a rubber policeman. They were then spun at 1000 × g for 5 min and resuspended in Puck's saline A (Sigma) complemented with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and, when indicated, 1 mmMnCl2, at a concentration of 106 cells/ml. Cells were incubated on ice for 15 min with the various antibodies before they were added to the wells (105 cells/well). The adhesion assay was performed for 1 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. Non adherent cells were washed away with PBS. Adherent cells were fixed for 20 min with 4% formaldehyde in PBS, rinsed with PBS, and stained with 0.2% crystal violet in 2% ethanol for 30 min. Excess stain was removed with PBS, and cell-associated stain was released in 50 μl (per well) of 1% SDS. When homogenous coloration was obtained, the absorbance (595 nm) was measured with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader (Molecular Devices Corp.). Each assay point was derived from three separate wells in three independent experiments. Cell adhesion assays using embryonic ectoderm cells were performed as previously described (26Ramos J.W. DeSimone D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 227-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Briefly, animal cap ectoderm was dissected from stage 9 blastula, dissociated in calcium/magnesium-free MBS containing 1 mg/ml BSA. Single cells were transferred to a 96-well plate coated with the various substrates in complete MBS media containing 20 units/ml activin A (kindly provided by D. Gospodarowicz, Chiron Corp.) and 1 mg/ml BSA. Cells were photographed after 2 h on an Axiovert using a digital camera (Photometric Cool-Snap) and Isee imaging software. ADAM13 is essential for the migration of cranial neural crest cells. This role is thought to involve remodeling of the fibronectin substrate present in the migration pathways (9Alfandari D. Cousin H. Gaultier A. Smith K. White J.M. Darribere T. DeSimone D.W. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 918-930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Ongoing studies in our laboratory also suggest that the metalloprotease domain itself may not be responsible for the specificity of ADAM function but that the DC domain of ADAM13 (DC13) carries at least part of the functional specificity. 2K. M. Smith, A. Gaultier, D. Alfandari, J. M. White, and D. W. DeSimone, submitted for publication. We have therefore investigated whether the adhesive disintegrin and cysteine-rich domain of ADAM13 can interact with ECM proteins and in particular with fibronectin. To investigate the binding of ADAM13-DC to ECM proteins, we generated a secreted form by combining the signal sequence, the disintegrin domain and the cysteine-rich domain of ADAM13 (Fig. 1). This construct was introduced into two different plasmids, one for production inXenopus and/or mammalian cell lines (myc-DC13), and the other for production in Drosophila S2 cells (D-DC13). Both contain six histidines at their C terminus to allow purification from the culture supernatant, and myc-DC13 also contains a concatemer of six Myc epitope tags at its N terminus to facilitate immunodetection using the 9E10 monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz). Both proteins can be purified from the cell culture supernatant using either Ni-NTA- or concanavalin A-agarose beads (Fig. 1 A). The apparent molecular mass (54 kDa for myc-DC13 and 38 kDa for D-DC13) and the binding to concanavalin A both suggest that the secreted proteins are glycosylated. SDS-PAGE electrophoresis in reducing versusnonreducing conditions also suggests that the proteins have intramolecular disulfide bounds. Purified D-DC13 appears as one major band by silver staining (Fig. 1 B). We have used the myc-DC13 purified from transfected COS-7 cells to produce two monoclonal antibodies (7C9 and 8E8) that were used in this study. Although both monoclonal antibodies recognize the recombinant DC13, 7C9 recognizes best the reduced/denatured DC13 protein in Western blotting experiments, whereas 8E8 gives better results for the native protein (immunofluorescence). Interestingly, both monoclonal antibodies recognize the cysteine-rich domain of ADAM13 (Fig. 1 C). In all experiments the recombinant proteins produced in COS-7 and insect cells behave similarly and the presence of the large poly-Myc tag did not interfere with our assays. We also noticed that both D-DC13 and myc-DC13 appear to produce minor heavier forms that were not sensitive to the reducing agent (Fig. 1, A and B). These forms may represent dimers of the secreted DC13 proteins. Purified ECM proteins (Sigma) were blotted onto nitrocellulose either immediately or after different treatment (see “Materials and Methods”). Blotted proteins were then incubated with the myc-DC13 recombinant protein. BSA was used as a negative control for each experiment. In this assay, myc-DC13 bound to native fibronectin and EHS laminin, but not to native BSA, collagen IV, or the reduced fibronectin (Fig. 2). This interaction was not prevented by pre-incubation of fibronectin with reagents that block free cysteine (iodoacetamide). Surprisingly, denaturation of fibronectin by boiling the protein in SDS did not prevent myc-DC13 interaction. We next asked which domain or domains of fibronectin were responsible for DC13 binding. To determine which region of fibronectin was interacting with DC13, we used bacterially expressed GST fusion proteins corresponding to the different domains of Xenopusfibronectin (26Ramos J.W. DeSimone D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 227-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 A). These fusion proteins were used both in pull-down (Fig. 3 C) and in dot-blot experiments (data not shown) with similar results. Pull-down experiments were preferred because of the potential to do multiple binding and wash conditions at the same time. Using the various fusion proteins, we found that DC13 binds to GST-1.9, GST-12.12, GST-12.15, and GST-12.15V0. In contrast, no binding was observed for GST alone, GST-9.11, and GST-V. A representative example of the pull-down results is shown in Fig. 3 C. Interestingly, the GST-1.9 and all the C-terminal fusion proteins that bound to DC13 have in common a domain known to interact with heparin (Fig.3 A). In particular, the smallest fusion protein that bound to DC13 (GST-12.15V0) contains Hep II (33McCarthy J.B. Skubitz A.P. Palm S.L. Furcht L.T. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1988; 80: 108-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), which includes a short sequence responsible for the binding of heparan sulfate proteoglycans like syndecan-4 (24Woods A. Longley R.L. Tumova S. Couchman J.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 374: 66-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). For simplicity, we will refer to GST-12.15VO as the Hep II fusion protein. In Xenopus fibronectin the Hep II site contains the sequence PPRRPR and mutation of the two arginines into a threonine and a methionine (RR → TM) abolishes cell binding to this site (26Ramos J.W. DeSimone D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 227-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We have generated a similar mutation in the Hep II fusion protein and called the resulting protein mGST-12.15V0 or mHep II (mutated Hep II, Fig. 3 A). We tested the effectiveness of the mutation by assaying the ability of various fusion proteins to bind to dextran-agarose beads, which mimic the heparan sulfate group present on syndecan. As expected only the intact Hep II fusion protein was able to bind to dextran sulfate beads (Fig. 3 B). Similarly, only the intact Hep II, but not the mutated fusion protein, promoted embryonic cell attachment (Fig. 4 A). When pull-down experiments were repeated using wild type and the mutant Hep II fusion proteins, D-DC13 only bound to the wild type Hep II protein (Fig. 3 C). This result demonstrates that an intact syndecan-binding site is required for D-DC13 binding to the Hep II domain of fibronectin. This also suggests that syndecan and DC13 may cooperatively bind or compete for this binding site on fibronectin. The previous experiments show t"

GltS catalyzes the formation of two molecules of l-glutamate from 2-oxoglutarate and l-glutamine via intramolecular channeling of ammonia. GltS has the impressive ability of synchronizing its distinct catalytic centers to avoid wasteful consumption ofl-glutamine. We have determined the crystal structure of the ferredoxin-dependent GltS in several ligation and redox states. The structures reveal the crucial elements in the synchronization between the glutaminase site and the 2-iminoglutarate reduction site. The structural data combined with the catalytic properties of GltS indicate that binding of ferredoxin and 2-oxoglutarate to the FMN-binding domain of GltS induce a conformational change in the loop connecting the two catalytic centers. The rearrangement induces a shift in the catalytic elements of the amidotransferase domain, such that it becomes activated.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 89-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). The active sites can either be located on separate subunits in a multienzyme complex or in separate domains in multifunctional enzymes. Direct transfer between the enzyme-active sites prevents loss of the intermediate into solution, limits the entrance of the intermediate into competing processes, protects labile intermediates from degradation in solution, and increases the success rate of the catalytic cycle by lowering the probability of uncoupled consecutive reactions (2Ovadi J.

Glutamine amidotransferases play a central role in cellular metabolism as they provide the main route for the incorporation of nitrogen into various biomolecules. These well studied enzymes catalyze two reactions at separate catalytic centers. l-Glutamine is hydrolyzed in the glutaminase site yielding ammonia, which is, in the subsequent synthase reaction, added to an acceptor substrate that varies among the different glutamine amidotransferases. Structural and functional studies have revealed that glutamine amidotransferases function through the channeling of ammonia from the glutaminase site to the synthase site (3Miles E.W. Rhee S.

The enzyme is a complex iron-sulfur flavoprotein catalyzing the reductive transfer of the amido nitrogen from l-glutamine to 2-oxoglutarate to form two molecules ofl-glutamate (Scheme 1). In bacteria,l-glutamate is involved in osmoregulation (9Csonka L.N. Epstein W. Neidhart F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 1210-1223Google Scholar), is the precursor for other amino acids, and can be the precursor for heme biosynthesis (10Beale S.L. Neidhart F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 731-748Google Scholar). In plants, GltS is especially essential in the reassimilation of ammonia released by photorespiration.Amidotransferase domainL­glutamine+H2O→L­glutamate+NH3FMN-binding domain2­oxoglutarate+NH3→2­iminoglutarate+H2O2e−+FMNox→FMNred2­iminoglutarate+FMNred→L­glutamate+FMNoxSCHEME1On the basis of the amino acid sequence and the nature of the electron donor, three different classes of GltS can de defined as follows: 1) ferredoxin-dependent GltS (Fd-GltS), 2) NADPH-dependent GltS (NADPH-GltS), and 3) NADH-dependent GltS (properties of the three classes have been reviewed extensively (11Vanoni M.A. Curti B. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 617-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar)). Fd-GltS functions through the non-covalent binding of ferredoxin (Fd), which delivers reducing equivalents to the FMN cofactor via a 3Fe-4S cluster (12Navarro F. Martin-Figueroa E. Candau P. Florencio F.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 379: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The NADPH-GltS is catalytically active as a αβ-heterodimer in which the β-subunit serves as the electron donor for l-glutamate formation within the α-subunit (11Vanoni M.A. Curti B. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 617-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 13Ravasio S. Curti B. Vanoni M.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5533-5541Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Fd-GltS and the α-subunit of the NADPH-GltS (α-GltS) share considerable homology throughout their amino acid sequences. Despite this homology, Fd-GltS and α-GltS display a remarkable difference in the synchronization between the catalytic centers. α-GltS has significant glutaminase activity, indicative of weak coupling between the catalytic centers (14Vanoni M.A. Fischer F. Ravasio S. Verzotti E. Edmondson D.E. Hagen W.R. Zanetti G. Curti B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1828-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In contrast, Fd-GltS is tightly coupled and lacks any glutaminase activity. 2Ravasio, S., Dossena, L., Martin-Figueroa, E., Florencio, F. J., Mattevi, A., Morandi, P., Curti, B., and Vanoni, M. A.

Recently, the three-dimensional structure of Azospirillum brasilense α-GltS has been determined (16Binda C. Bossi R.T. Wakatsuki S. Arzt S. Coda A. Curti B. Vanoni M.A. Mattevi A. Structure. 2000; 8: 1299-1308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This crystal structure provided us with a new example of ammonia channeling and interdomain communication by N-terminal nucleophile (Ntn) amidotransferases. In this paper, we present the crystal structure of the Fd-GltS from the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. This enzyme of 165 kDa contains one FMN cofactor and one 3Fe-4S cluster as prosthetic groups (12Navarro F. Martin-Figueroa E. Candau P. Florencio F.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 379: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure was solved in different ligation and redox states, giving us new insights in the structural basis for synchronization and channeling between catalytic centers. TheglsF gene from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 was cloned, overexpressed in the glutamate auxotrophic Escherichia coli strain CLR207 RecA, and purified as described previously (12Navarro F. Martin-Figueroa E. Candau P. Florencio F.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 379: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Crystals of Fd-GltS were obtained at 4 °C by using the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method. The enzyme solution contained 16 mg/ml in 25 mm Pipes/KOH, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol. The reservoir solution contained 24–30% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000, 100 mm Tris-hydrochloride, pH 8.5, and 200 mm sodium acetate. Liganded enzyme was prepared by the addition of 4 mm l-methionine sulfone or 4 mm 6-diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine, 2 mm2-oxoglutarate, and 5 mm dithiothreitol prior to crystallization. Reduction of the Fd-GltS crystals was obtained by soaking the enzyme crystal with 2 mm l-glutamate at room temperature for 90 min. The redox state of the crystal upon the addition of l-glutamate was followed by single crystal microspectrophotometry. The crystal in its soaking solution with l-glutamate was placed in a quartz cell and reduction of the FMN and 3Fe-4S cluster was measured under aerobic conditions as a function of time (Zeiss MPM800) (17Mozzarelli A. Rossi G.L. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1996; 25: 343-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Before data collection, the crystals were cryoprotected by the reservoir solution plus 25% (v/v) 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol and flash-frozen in a nitrogen stream at 100 K. All diffraction data were recorded on beamline ID14-EH1 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France) using a MarCCD detector. Data were integrated by MOSFLM (18Leslie A.G.

The refined atomic coordinates of native Fd-GltS were used as the starting model for the determination of the structures of Fd-GltS co-crystallized with l-methionine sulfone/2-oxoglutarate and 6-diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine/2-oxoglutarate and of Fd-GltS reduced by l-glutamate.

Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 505-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (3873) Google Scholar). Crystals of Synechocystis sp. Fd-GltS were grown in the native state (no ligands), in the presence of 2-oxoglutarate and l-methionine sulfone and of 2-oxoglutarate and 6-diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine. Moreover, the structure of Fd-GltS with FMN in the reduced state was obtained by crystal soaking with the reaction product l-glutamate, which is able to reduce the flavin cofactor and the 3Fe-4S cluster.2 The overall structure as well as the geometry of the catalytic centers in all these complexes are virtually identical with root mean square deviations (r.m.s.d.) calculated from pairwise superpositions of less than 0.2 Å for equivalent Cα atoms. Unless stated otherwise, for the analysis of the model we shall refer to the structure resulting from the co-crystallization with 2-oxoglutarate/l-methionine sulfone solved at a resolution of 2.7 Å (Table I). Fd-GltS is a 1523-residue enzyme, which is composed of four structurally and functionally distinct domains (Fig.1). The overall topology of the N-terminal amidotransferase domain (residues 1–422) is characterized by a four layer α/β/β/α architecture and is similar to other Ntn-amidotransferases (15Zalkin H. Smith J.L. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1997; 72: 87-144Google Scholar). The amidotransferase domain from Fd-GltS contains the typical catalytic center of Ntn-amidotransferases, and the N-terminal Cys-1 catalyzes the hydrolysis of l-glutamine generating ammonia and the first molecule of l-glutamate (Scheme 1). The FMN-binding domain (residues 787–1239) of Fd-GltS is characterized by a classic (β/α)8 barrel. In the FMN-binding domain the 2-iminoglutarate intermediate, formed upon the addition of ammonia onto 2-oxoglutarate, is reduced by the FMN cofactor producing the second molecule of l-glutamate (Scheme 1). This domain also contains the enzyme 3Fe-4S cluster, which participates in the transfer of electrons from the Fd molecule to the FMN cofactor. The central domain (residues 423–786) is connecting the amidotransferase domain with the FMN-binding domain and has an α/β overall topology. The C-terminal domain (residues 1240–1507) has a right-handed β-helix topology composing seven β-helical turns. This domain does not have a direct function in glutamate synthase activity but rather a structural function through extensive interactions with the amidotransferase and FMN-binding domains (16Binda C. Bossi R.T. Wakatsuki S. Arzt S. Coda A. Curti B. Vanoni M.A. Mattevi A. Structure. 2000; 8: 1299-1308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This four-domain architecture of Fd-GltS closely resembles that ofA. brasilense α-GltS (16Binda C. Bossi R.T. Wakatsuki S. Arzt S. Coda A. Curti B. Vanoni M.A. Mattevi A. Structure. 2000; 8: 1299-1308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Superposition of the two structures results in a r.m.s.d. of 1.7 Å for 1403 topologically equivalent Cα atoms (45% sequence identity). However, the comparison between the enzymes reveals some crucial differences in their functional sites that lead to a better understanding of the mechanism of synchronization between the catalytic centers in GltSs. Superposition of the amidotransferase domains from Fd-GltS and α-GltS reveals a large difference in thel-glutamine-binding pocket. Here Cys-1 of Fd-GltS is shifted by 5 Å as compared with α-GltS (Fig.2 A). The electron density of the l-glutamine-binding pocket in Fd-GltS is well defined and allows the unambiguous positioning of Cys-1 (Fig. 2 B). The N-terminal Cys residue is held in position by forming hydrogen bonds to OE2 of Glu-1013 from the FMN-binding domain and NH1 of Arg-31, which is a strictly conserved residue in Ntn-amidotransferases (15Zalkin H. Smith J.L. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1997; 72: 87-144Google Scholar). Conversely, the N-terminal Cys residue in α-GltS cannot form a hydrogen bond with Glu-978 (homologous to Glu-1013 of Fd-GltS; Fig.2 A). The interaction between Cys-1 and Arg-31 in Fd-GltS can only occur due to the shift of the backbone of loop 31–39 and of the preceding α-helix (residues 15–30). The Cα atom of residue Arg-31 has moved 3.2 Å away with respect to the corresponding Arg-31 of α-GltS. The conformational changes in thel-glutamine-binding site create a solvent-accessible environment for Cys-1, whereas Cys-1 in α-GltS is shielded from the solvent (16Binda C. Bossi R.T. Wakatsuki S. Arzt S. Coda A. Curti B. Vanoni M.A. Mattevi A. Structure. 2000; 8: 1299-1308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The shift in the position of Cys-1 observed in Fd-GltS dramatically alters the geometry of the l-glutamine-binding pocket with respect to that found in α-GltS (Fig. 2 A) (16Binda C. Bossi R.T. Wakatsuki S. Arzt S. Coda A. Curti B. Vanoni M.A. Mattevi A. Structure. 2000; 8: 1299-1308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Indeed, no binding of substrate analogs in the l-glutamate-binding pocket was observed for any of the structures obtained by co-crystallization with l-methionine sulfone or 6-diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine. Conversely, co-crystallization of α-GltS with l-methionine sulfone resulted in binding of the substrate analog in the enzyme-active site (16Binda C. Bossi R.T. Wakatsuki S. Arzt S. Coda A. Curti B. Vanoni M.A. Mattevi A. Structure. 2000; 8: 1299-1308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This is in keeping with the functional data, which show that the glutaminase site is active in α-GltS (14Vanoni M.A. Fischer F. Ravasio S. Verzotti E. Edmondson D.E. Hagen W.R. Zanetti G. Curti B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1828-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and inactive in Fd-GltS.2Superposition of Fd-GltS and α-GltS with boundl-methionine sulfone readily demonstrates that the glutaminase site of Fd-GltS is in an inactive conformation in which the analog binding is made sterically impossible by the movement of Cys-1 (Fig. 2 A). Thus, the enzyme cannot consume anyl-glutamine in this conformation. The FMN-binding domains of Fd-GltS and α-GltS are highly similar. However, in Fd-GltS two long insertions occur at positions 813–822 and 907–933. The first insertion is unlikely to be of any structural or catalytic importance as it is not conserved among the GHS sequences. In contrast, the second insertion forms a loop, whose conformation is well defined by the electron density. This loop is located in the neighborhood of the 3Fe-4S cluster, at a distance of about 14 Å (Fig.3), and is conserved among all Fd-dependent GltSs, but not in the NAD(P)H-dependent enzymes (11Vanoni M.A. Curti B. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 617-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Together, these observations suggest that this second insertion is involved in the binding of Fd (hereafter referred to as “Fd loop”). Binding at this position would allow electron transfer from Fd to the 3Fe-4S cluster, which would then donate the electrons to the isoalloxazine ring of the FMN cofactor. The FMN and the 3Fe-4S cluster are located at 8 Å distance from each other in an identical position as observed in the structure of α-GltS (Fig. 4 A) (16Binda C. Bossi R.T. Wakatsuki S. Arzt S. Coda A. Curti B. Vanoni M.A. Mattevi A. Structure. 2000; 8: 1299-1308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The strictly conserved Met-475 bridges the two redox centers and is likely to be involved in electron transfer between the FMN and the cluster. The 2-oxoglutarate substrate is well defined in the electron density map resulting from the analysis of the protein co-crystallized with this substrate. 2-Oxoglutarate binds in front of the flavin and is maintained in the proper orientation for ammonia addition and subsequent reduction by interaction with Lys-972, Arg-992, and Thr-1065. This binding geometry is similar to that found in α-GltS. To investigate whether the binding of 2-oxoglutarate induces a conformational change in the catalytic site of the FMN-binding domain, we also crystallized Fd-GltS in the absence of 2-oxoglutarate. The catalytic centers of the unliganded and liganded Fd-GltS appeared to be highly similar. However, this may be due to the presence of two acetate ions in the 2-oxoglutarate-binding site, which mimic the 2-oxoglutarate substrate. Solution studies have shown that Fd-GltS reacts with its reaction product l-glutamate.2 In this back reaction,l-glutamate first reduces the FMN cofactor after which it reduces the 3Fe-4S cluster (Scheme 1). To investigate the structural consequences of FMN and 3Fe-4S cluster reduction in GltS byl-glutamate, the crystals grown in the absence of 2-oxoglutarate were employed for a soaking experiment withl-glutamate. Indeed, this reaction product was able to react with the crystalline protein and to reduce the FMN cofactor and 3Fe-4S cluster as shown by crystal microspectrophotometry (Fig.4 B). However, FMN and 3Fe-4S reduction did not lead to any conformational changes in the flavin site or the catalytic centers of the amidotransferase and FMN-binding domains (Fig. 4 A). These observations are fully consistent with kinetic studies2 and indicate that Fd binding and not flavin reduction triggers the activation of the glutaminase site. During catalysis of Fd-GltS, ammonia produced by l-glutamine hydrolysis is channeled to the 2-oxoglutarate-binding site, in which 2-iminoglutarate is formed. The crystal structure of Fd-GltS with the inactive glutaminase site exhibits an intra-molecular channel of 24 Å (measured from the Cα atom of Ser-1011 to O2 of 2-oxoglutarate) from the 2-oxoglutarate-binding site to the main chain atoms of residues 503, 504, and 1011–1013 (Fig. 3). The backbone atoms of these five residues obstruct the channel and are located in the proximity of Cys-1. The most striking functional feature of Fd-GltS is its ability to coordinate its catalytic centers such that it avoids wasteful consumption of l-glutamine when Fd and 2-oxoglutarate are not available. The kinetic characterization of Fd-GltS has shown that the binding of both Fd and 2-oxoglutarate is required to activate the glutaminase site.2 The absence of any glutaminase activity in solution further highlights the tight coupling between the glutaminase site, 2-iminoglutarate reduction site, and Fd binding. The most important protein region for communication between the catalytic centers and Fd binding appears to be the strictly conserved polypeptide loop 4 in the FMN-binding domain (residues 968–1013) (Fig. 3). The N-terminal region of loop 4 is located in the proximity of the Fd loop with a direct contact between the OH of Tyr-987 (loop 4) and OD1 of Asp-907 (Fd loop). Further downstream, loop 4 wraps around the 2-oxoglutarate-binding site being hydrogen-bonded to 2-oxoglutarate through Arg-992 and Lys-972. At the C terminus, loop 4 lines the channel for the transfer of ammonia and with the C-terminal residue Glu-1013 it forms a hydrogen bond to the backbone nitrogen of Cys-1, thereby keeping the Cys-1 in the inactive conformation (Fig. 2). We propose that binding of Fd and 2-oxoglutarate to the FMN-binding domain of Fd-GltS induces a conformational change in loop 4. This may be transduced to loop 4 C-terminal residues, which open the channel (residues 1011 and 1012) and move slightly the side chain of Glu-1013, thereby breaking the hydrogen bond with Cys-1 (Fig. 2). This may have the following effects in the glutaminase site. 1) Cys-1 shifts to a conformation in which it is able to bind the l-glutamine substrate. It is likely that Cys-1 takes up a conformation similar to that observed in the crystal structure of α-GltS in the catalytically active conformation bound to l-methionine sulfone (12Navarro F. Martin-Figueroa E. Candau P. Florencio F.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 379: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). 2) The shift of Cys-1 induces a conformational change in loop 31–39, such that Arg-31 can make a hydrogen bond to Cys-1 and a salt bridge to Glu-1013. At this stage, l-glutamine can be hydrolyzed producing the first molecule ofl-glutamate and ammonia to be channeled to the 2-oxoglutarate-binding site (Scheme 1). The crystal structure of Fd-GltS suggests the crucial elements in the synchronization between the catalytic centers: formation of the complex between Fd and Fd-GltS, 2-oxoglutarate binding to the FMN-binding domain, rearrangement of loop 4, and movement of Cys-1 and loop 31–39 in the amidotransferase domain. Such a sophisticated machinery allows the transduction of two activating signals (Fd and 2-oxoglutarate) across a distance of more than 30 Å, thereby controlling the ability of the enzyme to bind the ammonia-donating substrate l-glutamine. We thank E. Martin-Figueroa for technical assistance in the early stages of this work."
https://openalex.org/W2132755702,"To gain insight into the dynamic properties of focal contacts, we induced expression of green fluorescent protein-tagged beta3 integrin (GFP-beta3) and actinin-1 (GFP-actinin-1) in endothelial cells. Both tagged proteins localize with alpha(v)beta3 integrin in focal contacts distributed towards the periphery of transfected cells. Labeled focal contacts migrate at about 0.1 mm/min in stationary live endothelial cells. We compared beta3 integrin and actinin-1 dynamics in focal contacts by using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. Recovery of signal in bleached focal contacts that have incorporated actinin-1 is rapid and occurs within less than 4 min. This recovery is energy-dependent. In contrast, recovery of bleached focal contacts that contain GFP-beta3 integrin takes longer than 30 min. Yet, when a narrow stripe of fluorescence is bleached across a beta3 integrin-labeled focal contact, recovery is complete within 16 min. The latter recovery is energy-dependent and is blocked not only by actin-filament disrupting drugs but also by a myosin light chain kinase inhibitor. Thus, integrins are not immobile when incorporated into focal contacts, as some have suggested. We propose that integrins are mobile within the confines of focal contacts and that this mobility is supported by an actin-associated molecular motor."
https://openalex.org/W2163490797,"IgE is the central mediator in atopic allergies such as hay fever, eczema, and asthma; therefore, it is a prime target in the development of allergen-independent preventive treatments. We describe an active immunization strategy that has the potential to reduce IgE to a clinically significant extent. The active vaccine component is a chimeric IgE molecule, Cepsilon2-Cepsilon3-Cepsilon4. The receptor-binding target domain, Cepsilon3, is derived from the recipient species, whereas the flanking domains, Cepsilon2 and Cepsilon4, are derived from an evolutionarily distant mammal. The flanking domains have dual functions, acting both as structural support for the Cepsilon3 domain and to break T cell tolerance by providing foreign T cell epitopes. The efficacy of the vaccine was studied in an ovalbumin-sensitized rat model. Vaccination resulted in antibody responses against IgE in all rats and in a substantial reduction in serum IgE levels in three out of four strains. The skin reactivity upon allergen challenge was significantly reduced in vaccinated animals. The vaccine appears to be safe to use as an antigen. No cross-linking activity was observed in sera of vaccinated animals, and the response to vaccination was reversible with time. Our results suggest that active immunization against IgE has the potential to become a therapeutic method for humans."
https://openalex.org/W2318679023,"Previous studies have shown that hematopoietic cytokines, including erythropoietin (Epo) and interleukin (IL)-3, activate the Ras GTPase and the downstream Raf/Erk/Elk-1 signaling pathway. Here we report that Epo or IL-3 rapidly and transiently activates Rac, a Rho family GTPase, in hematopoietic cell lines, 32D/EpoR-Wt and UT-7. The cytokine-induced activation of Rac was augmented in a 32D/EpoR-Wt clone that inducibly overexpresses the adaptor protein CrkL or the Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor C3G, which forms a complex with CrkL. Furthermore, the Rac activation was enhanced or inhibited in cells inducibly expressing an activated Ras mutant, H-Ras61L, or a dominant negative Ras mutant, H-Ras17N, respectively. In addition, the cytokine-induced Rac activation was inhibited by a phosphatidyl-inositol 3'-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, LY294002, which also inhibited the Erk activation. A dominant negative Rac mutant, Rac17N, also inhibited the cytokine-induced activation of Erk as well as Elk-1. On the other hand, activation of Akt downstream of PI3K was found to play an inhibitory role in cytokine activation of Erk/Elk-1. Together, these results indicate that Rac is activated by Epo or IL-3 at downstream of the Ras/PI3K pathway in parallel with Akt and plays a role in activation of the Erk/Elk-1 signaling pathway in hematopoietic cells."
https://openalex.org/W2075243610,"During the last years, a direct link between DNA methylation and repressive chromatin structure has been established. This structural modification is mediated by histone deacetylases targeted to the methylated sequences by Methyl Binding Proteins (MBD). Human cancer cells exhibit both a global hypomethylation and some localized hypermethylations suggesting that the deregulation of the methylation machinery is a central event in tumorigenesis. Therefore, we have investigated in human tissues the expression of two major MBDs, MeCP2 and MBD2, during the proliferation of normal breast and in benign and neoplasic breast tumors. Quantitation of the transcripts indicates that MBD2 mRNAs are 20–30-fold more abundant than MeCP2 transcripts in the adult and fetal human mammary gland. In pathological tissues samples MBD2 mRNA levels are significantly higher (P=0.001) in benign tumors compared with normal breast tissues, whereas MeCP2 expression is not modified in these specimens. In neoplasic samples a deregulation of the expression of both genes was found. The amounts of MBD2 and MeCP2 transcripts vary greatly between samples in cancer cells compared to normal breast tissues or benign tumors, and in invasive ductal carcinomas the amount of MBD2 mRNA is significantly (P=0.03) associated with the tumor size. Taken together these data suggest that upregulation of MBD2 might be associated with breast cell proliferation. In line with this hypothesis MBD2 is also upregulated during the prenatal development of the human mammary gland, but in contrast to that observed in tumor cells, MeCP2 is also coordinately upregulated in the fetal breast tissues, suggesting that deregulation of MeCP2 and MBD2 occurs in human breast cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2321026485,"The role of the PI 3-kinase signaling pathway in UVB-induced c-fos gene expression was investigated in a human keratinocyte cell line, HaCaT. The enzymatic activity of PI 3-kinase was increased threefold by 250 J/m2 UVB. Inhibition of PI 3-kinase activity, via expression of a mutant p85 subunit or treatment with wortmannin, resulted in decreased levels of c-fos promoter activity and c-fos protein. Two members of the PI 3-kinase signaling pathway, Akt and GSK-3β, were also found to affect c-fos transactivation. Expression of dominant negative Akt or wild-type GSK-3β significantly inhibited UVB-induced c-fos promoter activity. In addition, when GSK-3β activity was inhibited by lithium chloride, both c-fos promoter activity and protein levels increased. These results demonstrate that both Akt activation and GSK-3β inactivation are required in the UVB-induction of c-fos. Our results demonstrate for the first time that UVB induction of c-fos is in part mediated by the PI 3-kinase signaling pathway in the HaCaT cell line. By identifying the multiple signaling pathways that are induced by UVB and contribute to the induction of c-fos expression, more drug targets may be identified to aid attempts to prevent and treat skin cancer."

The observed neurodegeneration in these mice is believed to result from adverse effects of the mutant PrP rather than overexpression of the transgene (12Telling G.C. Haga T. Torchia M. Tremblay P.

Intracerebral inoculation of tissue from diseased animals transmitted the disease to healthy P101L mice expressing low levels of the transgene, but not to mice expressing normal PrP (11Hsiao K.K.

Subsequently, mice expressing a single copy of the P101L allele were generated by homologous recombination to avoid artifacts because of transgene overexpression. These mice also lacked PrPScdeposits, but surprisingly, although none of the animals developed spontaneous disease, their susceptibility to exogenous PrPSc infection was altered dramatically (13Manson J.C.

Thus, it appears that PrP102L alters certain cellular characteristics or functions of neuronal cells that influence the replication or toxicity of exogenously introduced PrPSc. The reasons for these discrepant observations are presently unclear. We investigated the biogenesis of PrP102L in transfected human neuroblastoma cells in an attempt to model the events that might occur in vivo, and uncover the biochemical pathways of neurotoxicity in GSS102L. In this report, we show that the metabolism of PrP102L is altered, resulting in accumulation of a 20-kDa fragment of PrP on the cell surface, with a concomitant decrease in the expression of 18-kDa fragment, a product of normal recycling of PrP from the plasma membrane (15Chen S.G.

The 20-kDa fragment is likely derived from CtmPrP, a transmembrane form of PrP that has been implicated as a mediator of neurodegeneration in certain inherited and infectious prion disorders (21Hegde R.S. Mastrianni J.A. Scott M.R. Defea K.A. Trembley P. Torchia M. Dearmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Lingappa V.R. Science. 1998; 279: 827-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 22Hegde R.S. Tremblay P.

Our results suggest that the change in ratio of 18:20-kDa fragments on PrP102L cells may increase their vulnerability to PrPSc toxicity by unconventional pathways, thus accounting for the complex biological effects of PrP102L in vivo. The human neuroblastoma cell line M17 was obtained from Dr. J. Beidler (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY). Opti-MEM, fetal calf serum, penicillin/streptomycin, methionine, and cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), and LipofectAMINE were from Invitrogen; hygromycin B and MG132 were from Calbiochem; Tran35S-label was from ICN (Costa Mesa, CA); protein A-agarose and N-glycosidase F (PNGase-F) were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals; phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) was from GLYKO (Novato, CA). All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Transfected M17 cells expressing wild type (PrPC) or mutant (PrP102L) prion protein were generated as described in a previous report (17Singh N.

All cultures were maintained at 37 °C in Opti-MEM supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin, in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Cultures of transfected cells were supplemented with 500 μg/ml hygromycin to maintain the episomal plasmid carrying the PrP cDNA. Experiments were performed on bulk-selected cells at different times after transfection. For all experiments, cells were replated overnight and used at 90–95% confluence. The following antibodies were used in this study: anti-PrP monoclonal antibodies 3F4 (R. Kascsak, New York State Institute for Basic Research in Developmental Disabilities, Staten Island, NY) and 8H4 (M. S. Sy, Department of Pathology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH), and anti-PrP immune serum 2301 (generated in our facility). The antibody 3F4 is specific for residues 109 and 112 of PrP, 8H4 binds to an epitope between residues 145–180 of PrP, and 2301 antiserum was raised to C-terminal 220–230 residues of PrP. In a typical experiment, 9 × 106 cells were used for each condition. Equal amount of total protein was used from cells expressing either PrPC or PrP102L. Cells were rinsed with PBS and lysed in a buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, and 10 mm EDTA in Tris-buffered saline (TBS, 20 mmTris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4), containing 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin, antipain, pepstatin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). Cell debris was cleared by centrifugation at 290 × g, and protein in the supernatant was precipitated with five volumes of cold methanol at −20 °C for 2 h. Total cellular proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore) for 2.5 h at 70 V at 4 °C. Membranes containing transferred proteins were blocked in TBS containing 10% nonfat dry milk and 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h at 37 °C and probed with anti-PrP antibodies 3F4 (1:40,000), 8H4 (1:1000), or 2301 (1:1000) dissolved in antibody dilution buffer (TBS, 1% normal goat serum, 0.05% bovine serum albumin) essentially as described (18Zanusso G.

Immunoreactive bands were reacted with anti-mouse antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:4000), and visualized on an autoradiographic film by ECL (AmershamBiosciences). To detect PI-PLC-cleaved PrP in the culture medium, cells were treated with PI-PLC as described below, and the released PrP was methanol-precipitated and detected as described above. In a typical experiment, 9 × 106 cells expressing PrPCor PrP102L were used. Immunoprecipitation was performed essentially as described (17Singh N. Zanusso G. Chen S.G. Fujioka H. Richardson S.

Cells were starved in methionine-cysteine-free DMEM containing 5% dialyzed serum for 1 h, in the presence or absence of the appropriate inhibitor, and labeled with 0.166 mCi/ml Tran35S-label in the same medium for 30 min or 2 h. For overnight labeling, the labeling medium was mixed with normal medium containing serum in a ratio of 3:1. Labeled cells were washed with PBS and lysed as described above for Western blotting. Cell debris was cleared by centrifugation at 290 × g, and clarified lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with the appropriate antibodies in the presence of 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% N-lauryl sarcosine. Protein-antibody complexes bound to protein A-agarose were washed four times with 0.5 ml of wash buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 0.1%N-lauryl sarcosine, and 0.1 mm PMSF), the bound protein was eluted by boiling in sample buffer (Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 3% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE-fluorography. For pulse-chase experiments, cells were labeled with trans-[35S]methionine for 30 min and chased in normal medium. At the indicated times, the cells were washed with PBS, lysed, and subjected to immunoprecipitation as above. To identify the glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, cells were labeled with 250 μCi/ml [3H]ethanolamine overnight in complete medium and processed for immunoprecipitation as above. Two 10-cm dishes containing 9 × 106 PrPC- or PrP102L-expressing cells were washed with methionine-cysteine free DMEM, and preincubated in the same medium containing 5% dialyzed serum for 1 h at 37 °C. Cellular proteins were metabolically labeled with 0.332 or 0.166 μCi/ml Tran35S-label at 15 °C in a refrigerated incubator, or at 37 °C in the absence or presence of 30 μm MG132 for 2 h, and subjected to immunoprecipitation as above. Cells at steady state, or radiolabeled with trans-[35S]methionine were washed with Opti-MEM without serum, and incubated with 0.066–0.099 units/ml PI-PLC in fresh medium for 1 h at 37 °C. The medium was collected and centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at 290 × g to pellet any cells. PI-PLC-released proteins in the supernatant were precipitated with five volumes of cold methanol at −20 °C for 2 h, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted or immunoprecipitated as described above with the appropriate antibody to detect PrP. For deglycosylation, unlabeled, or radiolabeled immunoprecipitated proteins were reprecipitated with five volumes of cold methanol and resuspended in denaturing buffer (0.5% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol). Samples were boiled for 10 min and deglycosylated with PNGase-F (1000 units in 1% Nonidet P-40, 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5) for 1–3 h at 37 °C. Proteins were reprecipitated with five volumes of cold methanol at −20 °C for 2 h, dissolved in sample buffer, and resolved by SDS-PAGE immunoblotting or fluorography. PrPC- and PrP102L-expressing cells were washed and homogenized on ice in a buffer containing 10 mmHEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mmKCl, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol with 20 strokes of a Kontes all-glass Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was checked microscopically for cell breakage and centrifuged to pellet nuclei. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 20,000 × g to pellet membrane vesicles. These were resuspended in 0.5 ml of transport buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 115 mm KOAc, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol), and treated with 20 μg/ml proteinase K on ice for 30 min. After adding 5 mm PMSF to stop the reaction, membrane vesicles were re-pelleted, solubilized in lysis buffer, and immunoblotted with 3F4. Cells expressing PrPCor PrP102L were cultured on poly-d-lysine-coated glass coverslips overnight. One set of PrPC and PrP102L cells were incubated with anti-PrP antibody 3F4 (1:25) in complete medium for 30 min on ice, and two other sets of cells were incubated with the same antibody at the same dilution for 10 or 60 min each at 37 °C in a humidified CO2 incubator. At the end of each incubation period, cells were washed three times with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. Free aldehyde groups were quenched with 50 mm NH4Cl (in PBS), and nonspecific sites were blocked with PBS containing 10% goat serum and 0.2% bovine serum albumin, followed by 0.2% gelatin in PBS. Cells were then incubated with anti-mouse TRITC to detect the anti-PrP antibody bound to PrP molecules on the cell surface. Subsequently, the cells were incubated with 0.25 mg/ml unlabeled anti-mouse IgG for 40 min to block the remaining anti-PrP antibody sites on the cell surface, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 4 min. The cells were rinsed in PBS, and the internalized anti-PrP antibody was reacted with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse antibody to detect anti-PrP-PrP complexes that have been internalized from the cell surface. After a final wash in PBS, cells were mounted in gel mount (Biomeda Corp., Fostar City, CA) and observed using a laser scanning confocal microscope (Bio-Rad). The steady state expression of PrPC and PrP102L in transfected neuroblastoma cells was evaluated by immunoblotting cell-associated PrP with antibodies specific to PrP residues 109 and 112 (3F4), 145–180 (8H4), or 220–230 (2301). Immunoreaction with 3F4 showed, as expected, three glycoforms of PrPC comprising the unglycosylated form of 27 kDa, intermediate forms of 29–30 kDa, and highly glycosylated forms of 33–42 kDa (Fig. 1, lane 1). Deglycosylation with PNGase-F resulted in the appearance of a major species of 27 kDa, and a minor band migrating at 20 kDa. Lysates of PrP102L showed similar glycoforms of PrP and the 20-kDa fragment, but in contrast to PrPC, all the PrP102L glycoforms and the 20-kDa fragment migrated ∼1 kDa faster on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1, lanes 1 and 2 versus lanes 3 and 4). More importantly, the 20-kDa fragment is 4-fold more in PrP102Llysates as compared with PrPC (lane 2 versus lane 4). Immunoblotting with 8H4 revealed, in addition to the three glycoforms of PrPC observed above, truncated forms migrating at 27–30, 22, and 18 kDa (Fig. 1, lane 5). These forms represent C-terminal fragments of the highly glycosylated (27–30 kDa), intermediate (22 kDa), and unglycosylated (18 kDa) forms that are a product of normal recycling of PrP from the cell surface (15Chen S.G. Teplow D.B. Parchi P. Teller J.K. Gambetti P. Autilio-Gambetti L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19173-19180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Deglycosylation with PNGase-F revealed a major form of 27 kDa representing full-length PrP, and the truncated fragment of 18 kDa. A small amount of the 20-kDa fragment was also detected (Fig. 1,lane 6). Similar processing of PrP102L lysates revealed the three glycoforms of PrP, but surprisingly, the 18-kDa fragment and its glycosylated form of 22 kDa were barely detectable (Fig. 1, lane 7). Deglycosylation showed the 27-kDa full-length PrP as observed for PrPC. However, as compared with PrPC, the 18-kDa fragment was 5-fold less, and the 20-kDa fragment 4-fold more in PrP102L lysates. Unlike the 20-kDa fragment, migration of 18-kDa fragment of PrPC and PrP102L was similar (Fig. 1, lanes 6 and 8). A stronger 20-kDa band was observed in 3F4 blots as a result of higher affinity of 3F4 as compared with 8H4 antibody. The apparent difference in pattern of PrP forms in the 3F4 and 8H4 blots is a result of the fact that, in addition to the full-length forms, 8H4 detected C-terminal PrP forms that result from cleavage at residue 111/112 of PrP during normal recycling from the plasma membrane. The C-terminal fragments of 18, 24, and 27–30 kDa that arise from this cleavage have been described in the literature, and do not immunoreact with 3F4 because of disruption of its epitope at residue 109 (15Chen S.G. Teplow D.B. Parchi P. Teller J.K. Gambetti P. Autilio-Gambetti L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19173-19180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). The 20-kDa fragment is detected by both 3F4 and 8H4 antibodies, suggesting that it is a C-terminal fragment of PrP. The C-terminal antibody 2301 yielded similar results as obtained with 8H4 (data not shown). The increased representation of 20-kDa fragment in PrP102Llysates could be the result of increased production resulting from abnormal metabolism of PrP102L or, conversely, decreased turnover of the 20-kDa fragment caused by misfolding or aggregation because it probably includes the PrP102L mutation. The decreased representation of 18-kDa fragment, on the other hand, could be caused by reduced expression of full-length PrP102L on the cell surface because of sequestration in an intracellular compartment or, conversely, normal surface expression but decreased endocytosis and/or recycling to the plasma membrane. These possibilities were investigated in the following experiments. To evaluate whether accumulation of the 20-kDa fragment is the result of increased production as a result of aberrant metabolism of PrP102L, PrPC- and PrP102L-expressing cells were labeled with Tran35S-label for 2 h and subjected to immunoprecipitation with 3F4 or 8H4 antibodies. The three glycoforms of PrP and the 20-kDa fragment were detected with 3F4 in both PrPC and PrP102L lysates, and as observed in Fig. 1, PrP102L glycoforms and the 20-kDa fragment migrated ∼1 kDa faster than PrPC forms (Fig.2A, lanes 1 and 2). The 20-kDa fragment was prominent in both samples, but in contrast to the results obtained in Fig. 1 at steady state, the 20-kDa fragment was not over-represented in PrP102L lysates (Fig.2 A, lanes 1 and 2). Similar results were obtained with 8H4 antibody (Fig. 2 A, lanes 3and 4). A small amount of 18-kDa fragment could be detected in 8H4 immunoprecipitates, but there was no significant difference in the amount detected in PrPC and PrP102L lysates (Fig. 2 A, lanes 3 and 4). Because the difference in the amount of 18- and 20-kDa fragments in PrPC and PrP102L lysates was detected at steady state but not after a 2-h pulse, it probably arose as a result of a cumulative process that becomes apparent over time, and not because of an acute abnormality in the metabolism of PrP102L. To confirm the above results, the synthesis and turnover of PrPC and PrP102L were compared in a pulse-chase paradigm. Cells were radiolabeled with Tran35S-label for 30 min and chased for 0, 2, and 4 h. At the end of each chase period, radiolabeled GPI-linked surface proteins were cleaved with PI-PLC at 37 °C for 1 h, and the medium was collected. Subsequently, cell lysates and the PI-PLC-cleaved proteins were subjected to immunoprecipitation with 3F4 and fractionated by SDS-PAGE. Lysates treated with PI-PLC for 1 h soon after the pulse show the three glycoforms of PrPC and the 20-kDa fragment (Fig.2 B, lane 1). With increasing chase time, the amount of full-length PrPC forms and the 20-kDa fragment decreased in the lysate samples, and a corresponding increase was observed in the PI-PLC-cleaved samples (Fig. 2 B, lanes 1–3 and 7–9). PrP102L samples showed similar kinetics of synthesis and transport of full-length and 20-kDa forms to the plasma membrane (Fig. 2 B, lanes 4–6and 10–12), except for a significant decrease in full-length PrP102L forms after 4 h of chase both in the lysate and PI-PLC-cleaved samples (Fig. 2 B,lanes 6 and 12). In addition, a 14-kDa form was detected in the PrP102L lysates soon after the pulse, which decreased gradually with chase (Fig. 2 B,lanes 4–6). Although the 14-kDa form of PrP102Lwas not detected in the PI-PLC-cleaved samples, subsequent experiments with long term labeling showed that it was indeed secreted into the culture medium (see Fig. 4 B). The above results highlight important characteristics of the 20-kDa fragment: 1) it is generated soon after pulse and does not increase with chase, indicating that it is not a metabolic product of full-length PrP, 2) it is transported to the cell surface and is cleavable by PI-PLC, and 3) it does not accumulate intracellularly or on the cell surface after 4 h of chase. Together, these results show that the 20-kDa fragment arises from an alternate form of PrP, probably the transmembrane PrP (CtmPrP), and the accumulation of this fragment observed in PrP102L lysates in Fig. 1 is not the result of increased production or sequestration in an intracellular compartment, but perhaps of reduced degradation. If the 20-kDa fragment arises from CtmPrP, it must be GPI-linked (20Stewart R.S. Drisaldi B. Harris D.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 881-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). To check this assumption, PrPC and PrP102L cells labeled overnight with the anchor component [3H]ethanolamine were lysed, immunoprecipitated with 3F4, and treated with PNGase-F to remove all glycans. The samples were fractionated on a long SDS-PAGE gel to accentuate the difference in migration of the 20-kDa fragment from PrPC and PrP102L lysates. As expected, the 27-kDa full-length form and the 20-kDa fragment of PrP102L migrated ∼1 kDa faster on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2 C, lane 1 versus lane 2). More importantly, the 20-kDa fragment from both PrPC and PrP102L lysates was labeled with [3H]ethanolamine, confirming that it is linked with the GPI anchor (Fig. 2 C, lanes 1 and2). As observed in Fig. 1 above, the 20-kDa was 4-fold more in PrP102L lysates as compared with PrPC. To evaluate whether the 20-kDa fragment arises from CtmPrP, PrPC and PrP102L cells were treated with the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 for 2 h, and subjected to immunoblotting with 3F4. There was a marked increase in the 20-kDa fragment after proteasomal inhibition, whereas the full-length PrP glycoforms were virtually unchanged (Fig.3 A, lane 1 versus lane 2 and lane 3 versus lane 4). BecauseCtmPrP is GPI-linked and degraded by the proteasomal pathway (20Stewart R.S. Drisaldi B. Harris D.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 881-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), an increase in a GPI-linked 20-kDa fragment (Fig.2 C) after proteasomal inhibition indicates its origin fromCtmPrP. A significant increase in a 26-kDa band was also noted after proteasomal inhibition, especially in PrPClysates. The identity of this PrP form is currently under investigation. To further confirm the origin of 20-kDa fragment from CtmPrP, microsomes prepared from PrPC and PrP102L cells were treated with 20 μg/ml PK on ice for 30 min and subjected to immunoblotting with 3F4 or anti-calnexin antibodies. Because the N terminus of CtmPrP faces the cytosol, it would be cleaved by PK treatment, releasing a C-terminal fragment of ∼20 kDa in the ER, whereas the fully translocated PrP in the ER lumen would be protected from protease digestion and therefore show no change in migration or intensity (21Hegde R.S. Mastrianni J.A. Scott M.R. Defea K.A. Trembley P. Torchia M. Dearmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Lingappa V.R. Science. 1998; 279: 827-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 22Hegde R.S. Tremblay P.

https://openalex.org/W2081962574,"AML1/Evi-1 is a chimeric protein that is derived from t(3;21), found in blastic transformation of chronic myelogenous leukemia. It is composed of the N-terminal AML1 portion with the DNA-binding Runt domain and the C-terminal Evi-1 portion. It has been shown to dominantly repress AML1-induced transactivation. The mechanism for it has been mainly attributed to competition with AML1 for the DNA-binding and for the interaction with PEBP2β (CBFβ), a partner protein which heterodimerizes with AML1. It was recently found that Evi-1 interacts with C-terminal binding protein (CtBP) to repress TGFβ-induced transactivation. Here, we demonstrate that AML1/Evi-1 interacts with CtBP in SKH1 cells, a leukemic cell line which endogenously overexpresses AML1/Evi-1 and that AML1/Evi-1 requires the interaction with CtBP to repress AML1-induced transactivation. The association with CtBP is also required when AML1/Evi-1 blocks myeloid differentiation of 32Dcl3 cells induced by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. Taken together, it is suggested that one of the mechanisms for AML1/Evi-1-associated leukemogenesis should be an aberrant recruitment of a corepressor complex by the chimeric protein."

https://openalex.org/W2014230676,"Based on the integral role that argininosuccinate synthase (AS) plays in the production of nitric oxide in vascular endothelial cells and urea in liver, an analysis was carried out to determine whether signals reside in the AS mRNA to account for tissue differences in AS function and location. Reverse transcriptase-PCR and sequence analysis showed that the AS mRNA coding region was the same for both endothelial cells and liver; however, 5′-RACE analysis (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) identified AS mRNA species in endothelial cells in addition to a major 43-nucleotide (nt) 5′-untranslated region (UTR) AS mRNA with overlapping extended 5′-UTRs of 66 and 92 nt. Comparison to the genomic sequence immediately upstream of the reported transcription start site for the human and mouse AS gene suggested that expression of all three species of bovine endothelial AS mRNA are driven by a common promoter and that 5′-UTR diversity in endothelial cells results from three transcriptional initiation sites within exon 1. RNase protection analysis and real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR verified and quantitated the differential expression of the extended 5′-UTR species relative to the major 43-nt 5′-UTR AS mRNA. In vitrotranslation studies showed a less pronounced but similar discordant expression. Sequential deletions starting from the 5′ terminus of the 92-nt 5′-UTR construct resulted in a corresponding increase in translational efficiency, but the most pronounced effect resulted from mutation of an upstream open reading frame, which restored translational efficiency of the 92-nt 5′-UTR AS mRNA. When the different AS mRNA 5′-UTRs, cloned in front of a luciferase reporter gene, were transfected into endothelial cells, the pattern of luciferase expression was nearly identical to that observed for the different 5′-UTR AS mRNAs in endothelial cells. Given the different roles ascribed for argininosuccinate synthase, urea versus NO production, these results suggest that sequence in the AS gene represented by position −92 to −43 nt from the translation start site in the extended AS mRNA 5′-UTRs plays an important role in differential and tissue-specific expression.

Sequential deletions starting from the 5′ terminus of the 92-nt 5′-UTR construct resulted in a corresponding increase in translational efficiency, but the most pronounced effect resulted from mutation of an upstream open reading frame, which restored translational efficiency of the 92-nt 5′-UTR AS mRNA. When the different AS mRNA 5′-UTRs, cloned in front of a luciferase reporter gene, were transfected into endothelial cells, the pattern of luciferase expression was nearly identical to that observed for the different 5′-UTR AS mRNAs in endothelial cells. Given the different roles ascribed for argininosuccinate synthase, urea versus NO production, these results suggest that sequence in the AS gene represented by position −92 to −43 nt from the translation start site in the extended AS mRNA 5′-UTRs plays an important role in differential and tissue-specific expression. argininosuccinate synthase untranslated region nucleotide open reading frame upstream ORF argininosuccinate lyase bovine aortic endothelial cells rapid amplification of cDNA ends ribonuclease protection assay reverse transcriptase Tris-buffered saline Tween 20 nitric oxide Argininosuccinate synthase (AS)1 catalyzes the reversible ATP-dependent ligation of citrulline and aspartate to produce argininosuccinate, AMP, and inorganic pyrophosphate. The primary role of AS is the detoxification of ammonia via the urea cycle in the liver (1Morris S.M., Jr. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1992; 12: 81-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Although this essential physiological function occurs in the liver and to a lesser extent in the small intestine, virtually all other mammalian tissues possess detectable levels of AS and a second urea cycle enzyme argininosuccinate lyase (AL). Together these two enzymes have the net effect of generating arginine from citrulline and aspartate. In the kidney, AS and AL are responsible for the de novo synthesis of arginine to be released into the bloodstream (2Wu G. Morris S.M., Jr. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (2224) Google Scholar). In other tissues, however, the function of this metabolic pathway remained obscure until the discovery of arginine-derived nitric oxide (NO) (3Hecker M. Sessa W.C. Harris H.J. Anggard E.E. Vane J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8612-8616Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). In endothelial cells, AS catalyzes the rate-limiting step (4Xie L. Gross S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16624-16630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) in the synthesis of l-arginine from l-citrulline. Endothelial nitric-oxide synthase then utilizes the arginine, converting it back to citrulline to produce NO. Thus, available arginine is a prerequisite for NO production. Interestingly, intracellular levels of arginine in endothelial cells have been estimated to range from 0.1 to 0.8 mm (3Hecker M. Sessa W.C. Harris H.J. Anggard E.E. Vane J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Yet an increase in extracellularl-arginine levels and/or an increase in the synthesis of arginine from extracellular citrulline will increase NO production from stimulated endothelial cells (3Hecker M. Sessa W.C. Harris H.J. Anggard E.E. Vane J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8612-8616Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 10Flam B.R. Hartmann P.J. Harrell-Booth M.

Neuroscience. 1995; 68: 1295-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Moreover, during shear stress-induced NO synthesis (16Dimmeler S. Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Hermann C. Busse R. Zeiher A.M. Nature. 1999; 399: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (3056) Google Scholar) AS levels are up-regulated along with several other genes suggested to play a role in the regulation of NO production (17McCormick S.M. Eskin S.G. McIntire L.V. Teng C.L., Lu, C.M. Russell C.G. Chittur K.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8955-8960Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). These results have been taken to suggest that a separate pool of arginine is maintained for NO production in endothelial cells by either transport and/or the regeneration of arginine from citrulline (3Hecker M. Sessa W.C. Harris H.J. Anggard E.E. Vane J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8612-8616Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 10Flam B.R. Hartmann P.J. Harrell-Booth M.

Neuroscience. 1995; 68: 1295-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The physiological importance of the arginine regeneration system also was suggested by a case report of two infants with a deficiency in argininosuccinate lyase (also essential for arginine regeneration from citrulline) who were shown to be hypertensive. Infusion of arginine resulted in the lowering of blood pressure in these infants, suggesting a critical role for arginine regeneration in the regulation of systemic blood pressure (18Fakler C.R. Kaftan H.A. Nelin L.D. Acta Paediatr. Scand. 1995; 84: 460-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). More recently we have shown that AS and AL co-fractionate (along with endothelial NO synthase) with the endothelial caveolar fraction (10Flam B.R. Hartmann P.J. Harrell-Booth M. Solomonson L.P. Eichler D.C. Nitric Oxide. 2001; 5: 187-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar); therefore, regeneration of arginine from citrulline is not only integral in endothelial NO production but also may involve different regulation and cellular localization relative to the hepatic AS and urea production. For this reason we have proposed that an endothelial isoform expressed from the same gene as the liver form (19Freytag S.O. Bock H.G. Beaudet A.L. O'Brien W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3160-3166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) manifests some variations allowing AS to function in a different cellular location (10Flam B.R. Hartmann P.J. Harrell-Booth M. Solomonson L.P. Eichler D.C. Nitric Oxide. 2001; 5: 187-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and to be coordinately regulated with NO production (17McCormick S.M. Eskin S.G. McIntire L.V. Teng C.L., Lu, C.M. Russell C.G. Chittur K.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8955-8960Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). In support of this hypothesis, variations in the physical properties of the liver and endothelial cell AS protein were detected using different physical separation techniques and visualization by immunoblotting. 2B. R. Flam, L. C. Pendleton, B. L. Goodwin, L. P. Solomonson, and E. C. Eichler, unpublished observations. Based on these findings, we examined AS cDNA from liver and vascular endothelial tissue to determine whether differences in expression and in functional and physical properties could be accounted for at the level of the messenger RNA. In this report we show that the translatable sequence of AS mRNA is identical for both tissues but that the sequence represented by the diversity of endothelial AS mRNA 5′-UTRs may account in part for the specialized regulation of expression in nitric oxide production. Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Mediatech) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone Laboratories), penicillin, streptomycin, and amphotericin B (Mediatech). Total RNA was isolated from BAEC by the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (20Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar) using Tri Reagent (Molecular Research Center) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Total RNA from bovine liver was purchased from CLONTECH Laboratories. Total RNA from bovine liver and BAEC was reverse-transcribed using Superscript II recombinant Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The annealing reaction, 10 μg of total RNA and 100 ng of random hexamers, was incubated at 65 °C for 10 min and then cooled to 4 °C. 1× first strand buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.3, 75 mm KCl, 3 mmMgCl2), 10 mm dithiothreitol, 40 units of RNasin, 500 μm dNTP each, and 500 units of the Superscript RT were added, and the reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction was stopped by incubation at 80 °C for 10 min. The resulting cDNA was amplified by PCR using primers (Integrated DNA Technologies) designed against the published bovine liver AS sequence (M26198). Primer sequences are listed in TableI. ASL10 was combined with ASR1338, ASR773, and ASR348 to yield fragments of 1328, 763, and 338 bp, respectively. ASL572 was combined with ASR1209 to yield a 637-bp fragment, and ASL882 was combined with ASR1338 to yield a 456-bp fragment. Primers were named based on the designation of position 1 as the first base of the AUG start codon.Table IPrimer Sequences for PCR Amplification of AS Open table in a new tab All PCR reactions contained 1× assay Buffer B (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.3, and 50 mm KCl), 200 μm each dNTP, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 μl of cDNA, 5% Me2SO, 50 pmol of each primer, and 2.5 units ofTaq polymerase (Fisher Scientific) and consisted of 35 cycles at 95 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 3 min. Reactions were started by a 5-min denaturation step and ended with a 10-min synthesis step. PCR fragments were separated by electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. 5′- and 3′-RACE analysis was carried out using the SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH Laboratories). This technique involved the incorporation of a “Smart Oligo” onto the 5′-end of the reverse-transcribed cDNA for the 5′-RACE analysis. For the 3′-RACE analysis, the Smart Oligo was attached to an oligo (dT) primer to yield cDNA that had a complete 3′-UTR, a poly-A tail, and a Smart Oligo sequence extension. The 5′- and 3′-ends of AS were amplified using a standard PCR protocol. Primers were designed so that a short section of the coding region was amplified along with the 5′- or 3′-UTR. ASR348 was combined with the Smart Oligo primer to amplify the 5′-end, and ASL1188 was combined with the Smart Oligo primer to amplify the 3′-end. Primer sequences are listed in Table I. Amplified 5′- and 3′-RACE fragments were cloned and sequenced. To increase the efficiency of recovery of the specific RACE clones colony lifts were performed, and positive clones were selected by hybridization to the 1328-bp AS cDNA fragment generated by RT-PCR. RPAs were performed using the RiboQuant multiprobe RNase protection assay system (BD PharMingen). A portion of the AS 5′-UTR and 5′-coding region was amplified by RT-PCR using primers ASL-82 and ASR94 (listed in Table I) and used as a template to produce the RPA probe. The 176-bp fragment was cloned using the TOPO TA cloning dual promoter kit (Invitrogen) and sequenced. To generate the antisense RNA probe, the plasmid construct containing the 176-bp fragment was linearized with XhoI, purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, and quantitated. The 32P-labeled RNA probe was synthesized using T7 RNA polymerase and hybridized to 100 μg of BAEC total RNA or 15 μg of liver total RNA following the manufacturer's protocol. RNase digests were performed as per the standard protocol except that the RNase A was optimized to a final concentration of 38 ng/μl. Protected fragments were analyzed on a 6% acrylamide, 7 murea sequencing gel. The gel was dried and exposed to film. Band densities were quantitated using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Total RNA from bovine liver and BAEC was DNase-treated using DNA-free DNase treatment and removal reagent (Ambion) following the manufacturer's protocol. 1 μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed with the Superscript first-strand synthesis system for RT-PCR (Invitrogen) following the protocol for high G+C content mRNAs. An AS-specific primer, ASR348, was used to reverse transcribe, and the resulting cDNA was amplified using the SYBR Green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems). PCR conditions were 10 min at 95 °C followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C and 1 min at 60 °C. The PCR products were detected in real time using the iCycler iQ detection system (Bio-Rad). Primer sets were designed to amplify regions of AS mRNA common to all species, ASL228 and ASR278, as well as to detect the extended 5′-UTRs of 66-nt ASL-62 and ASR-12 and 92-nt ASL-84 and ASR-34 (Table I). AS mRNA was quantitated relative to a standard curve of AS plasmid DNA generated for each primer set. Replicates of five were performed for each primer set with each RT reaction. Results were reported as a percentage of the total AS mRNA. Full-length AS cDNA was constructed to contain the 92-nucleotide 5′-UTR and subcloned into the vector pPDM-2 (Epicentre Technologies). AS cDNA was amplified by PCR using Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene) to contain each of the three 5′-UTRs. 5′-primers contained aBamHI site, T7 promoter sequence, spacer region, and 20 bases of AS cDNA sequence corresponding to the first twenty bases of each 5′-UTR species (Table II). A control 5′-primer contained a BamHI site, T7 promoter sequence, spacer region, and a Kozak sequence of six bases (21Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4172) Google Scholar) followed by the ATG and 20 bases of AS cDNA sequence downstream of the start codon. The 3′-primer used for amplification of the full-length AS cDNA was ASR1338 (Table I). The PCR products were gel-purified, quantitated, and then transcribed and translated using the TNT T7 Quick for PCR DNA transcription/translation kit (Promega). For detection, Transcend biotin-lysyl-tRNA (Promega) was added to the reaction, resulting in the incorporation of biotinylated lysine into the translated protein.Table IIPrimer Design for In Vitro Transcription and Translation Open table in a new tab PCR fragments containing four different 5′-UTRs (three different AS UTRs plus the control, all with the T7 promoter sequence incorporated) were subcloned into the pPDM-2 vector using the BamHI site engineered into the fragments at the 5′-end and an EcoRI site at the 3′-end. Constructs were digested with EcoRV at a site past the 3′-end to prevent run-on transcription. Template DNAs were transcribed using T7 RNA polymerase with the addition of Ribo m7G cap analog (Promega) following the manufacturer's protocol recommended for m7G cap incorporation. Transcribed RNA was DNase-treated and purified using minispin G50 Sephadex (CPG) columns. The Flexi Rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) was used for the translation reaction following the manufacturer's protocol with the addition of 0.75 μl of transcend tRNA and 1 μg of capped RNA. KCl conditions were optimized to 40 μm. Translated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 12% Tris-HCl Ready Gels (Bio-Rad). Following electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore) using a wet transfer method (Bio-Rad). Following a blocking step of 1 h in TBST (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20), the membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with Streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase antibody (Promega or Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) at a final concentration of 0.025 μg/ml. The membranes were then washed three times in TBST and three times in nanopure water for 5 min per wash. The in vitro-translated proteins were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescent reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Biosciences) or Transcend reagent (Promega). Band densities were quantitated using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Membranes were then placed in blocking buffer composed of 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were incubated with the primary antibody, anti-β-actin, mouse monoclonal, clone AC-15 (Sigma) in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were washed and incubated with the secondary antibody, peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with TBST, membranes were visualized using chemiluminescent reagent and exposed to film. Band densities were quantitated as before. Deletion mutants were constructed to include 86, 81, 76, and 71 nt of the AS 5′-UTR along with the T7 promoter sequence by amplification and subcloning as described previously. Primer sequences are listed in Table II. Mutations of the uORF AUG were carried out using a PCR strategy. A sense primer, ASL-70 Mut1, was designed to generate a single base mutation, converting the uAUG to AAG. A second primer, ASL-73 Mut2, was designed to alter the context of the uAUG by changing the surrounding nucleotides. The sequence GGG AUG CGC was mutated to AGG AUG GGC, changing critical nucleotides at position −3 and +4 relative to the AUG to improve the function of the uAUG (21Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4172) Google Scholar). These primers were combined with ASR429 to amplify fragments of 499 and 502 bp, following the protocol listed in the PCR section. PfuTurbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene) was used to reduce the frequency of error in the amplification. The amplified fragments were gel-purified, sequenced, and used as right primers in a second amplification with ASL-92T7. Fragments were digested withBamHI and NarI and subcloned into the existing 92-nt 5′-UTR full-length AS cDNA construct. The deletion constructs and mutant AUG constructs were transcribed, translated, and analyzed by Western blotting. Luciferase reporter constructs were designed to include each of the AS 5′-UTRs cloned directly after the simian virus 40 promoter and before the start codon of the luciferase gene. Left primers ASL-92HindIII, ASL-66HindIII, and ASL-43HindIII were combined with ASRluc (Table I) to amplify the different sized AS 5′-UTRs with a HindIII site on the 5′-end and 45 bases of the luciferase gene attached to the 3′-end. This strategy took advantage of a NarI site within the luciferase gene close to the start codon. The amplified fragments were digested withHindIII and NarI and cloned into pGL3Control in place of the existing 5′-UTR. Constructs were verified by sequencing. BAEC to be used for transfections were plated at 2 × 104 cells per well in a 24-well plate. Control plasmids (Promega) included pGL3Control as a positive control, pGL3Basic as a promoterless negative control, and pRL-TK, a renilla expression vector, as an internal transfection control. Control, Basic, and experimental plasmids (200 ng each) and pRL-TK (50 ng) were transiently transfected into BAEC using Transit-LT1 (Panvera) in serum-free medium. After 4.5 h, the medium was replaced with complete medium, and cells were cultured for 48 h. Lysates generated with Passive lysis buffer (Promega) were assayed for luciferase and renilla activity using Promega's Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Luciferase and renilla activity were measured as relative light units using a luminometer (Turner Designs). Experiments were carried out three times in triplicate. Luciferase expression was normalized to renilla activity. To investigate possible differences in the coding region of AS mRNA, total RNA from bovine liver and cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells was reverse-transcribed and amplified by PCR using a series of oligonucleotide primer sets designed to cover the entire coding region of the mRNAs. The resulting amplified fragments were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, shown in Fig.1. As can be seen, the relative mobility of each set of amplified fragments was identical, indicating that there were no substantial differences in the two AS messages that would indicate splicing variations of the ∼13 exons that define the AS gene (22Freytag S.O. Beaudet A.L. Bock H.G. O'Brien W.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1978-1984Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To confirm this finding sequence analysis was carried out, which showed that there were no differences (data not shown) within the translatable sequence of endothelial and liver AS mRNA. Because the UTRs of mRNAs can influence stability, localization, and translation, rapid amplifications of the reverse-transcribed 5′- and 3′-ends of AS mRNA were carried out on bovine liver and cultured endothelial cell total RNA. The products of the RACE analyses were subcloned and sequenced. For the 3′-RACE analysis, minimal differences attributed to minor polymorphisms at the level of the gene were observed. Direct sequence analysis further confirmed this finding (data not shown). In contrast, the 5′-RACE analysis of endothelial AS mRNA yielded clones containing different length extensions of the 5′-UTR. The majority of clones represented AS mRNA with 43 nucleotides of sequence upstream of the AUG start codon common to liver and endothelial cells (Fig.2). A single isolated clone contained the identical 43 nt in the 5′-UTR but with an additional 23 nt of upstream sequence. A second clone verified the sequence of the 66-nt 5′-UTR but contained an additional 26 nt of upstream sequence for a total of 92 nt of 5′-UTR. Importantly, the 66- and 92-nt 5′-UTR clones were only identified by 5′-RACE analysis with endothelial cell total RNA. 5′-RACE analysis of liver total RNA yielded only the 43-nt AS 5′-UTR. To determine the possible genomic origin of the endothelial-specific AS 5′-UTR species, these sequences were compared with the 5′-UTR and genomic 5′-flanking regions from human (23Jinno Y. Matuo S. Nomiyama H. Shimada K. Matsuda I. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1985; 98: 1395-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and mouse (24Surh L.C. Beaudet A.L. O'Brien W.E. Gene. 1991; 99: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). Comparison of the 43-nt bovine AS mRNA 5′-UTR with exon 1 from human and mouse AS gene sequences demonstrated 72 and 64% homology, respectively. When a comparison was made of the 92-nt 5′-UTR from endothelial AS mRNA with the 5′-flanking genomic sequence from human and mouse, the percentage of homology increased to 78 and 71%, respectively. A sequence of 10 nt surrounding the TATTA box was identical in all three species. Importantly, the upstream AUG found in the extended 5′-UTR AS mRNAs from bovine endothelial cells was distinctly identified in the 5′-flanking genomic regions of both human and mouse AS genes. To verify and quantitate these results, RPAs were carried out on total RNA isolated from BAEC and liver using an antisense RNA probe complementary to the AS sequence extending from 82 nt upstream of the AUG start codon to 94 nt downstream of the start codon. Consistent with the 5′-RACE analysis, RNase protection analysis of the endothelial RNA yielded three different sized fragments (Fig. 4) corresponding to the predicted sizes of the different 5′-RACE AS mRNA sequences (43, 66, and 92 nt) identified previously. Quantitation by densitometry showed that 78% of the total AS mRNA contained the shortest 43-nt 5′-UTR sequence followed by 12% for the 92-nt 5′-UTR sequence and 10% for the 66-nt 5′-UTR. Notably, the RPA for liver AS mRNA only demonstrated the existence of the 43-nt 5′-UTR sequence. A second approach to quantitate relative levels of 5′-UTR AS mRNA species took advantage of the increased sensitivity of real-time RT-PCR analysis. As shown in Fig.5, real-time RT-PCR analysis corroborated the RPA results, demonstrating again the disproportionate expression of three AS mRNA 5′-UTR species found in endothelial cells. Because of the linear response of the technique over a large dynamic range, more accurate quantitation was generated for the percentages of each mRNA species. Plasmid DNA standards were detected in duplicate over a range of 9 orders of magnitude, easily allowing for the precise quantitation of mRNA levels differing by a factor of 100 or more. The percentage of the 43-, 66-, and 92-nt 5′-UTR AS mRNA species were determined to be 93.79 ± 1.24, 3.75 ± 1.70, and 2.46 ± 0.93%, respectively, of the total AS mRNA. The percentages are lower than those detected by ribonucle"

Studies in vascular smooth muscle cells and primary cardiomyocytes suggest that angiotensin II-mediated hypertrophy activates signaling pathways associated with cell proliferation. Regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk)-cyclin activities is essential to cell size control in lower eukaryotes, yet their role in the hypertrophic response in muscle is incompletely understood. We describe an in vitro model of hypertrophy in C2C12 skeletal myoblasts and demonstrate that induction of hypertrophy involves transient activation of Cdk4, subsequent phosphorylation of Rb, and release of HDAC1 from the Rb inhibitory complex. We also demonstrate that E2F-1 becomes transcriptionally active yet remains associated with Rb. We propose a model whereby partial inactivation of the Rb complex leads to derepression of a subset of E2F-1 targets necessary for cell growth without division during hypertrophy.

These observations suggest that AngII can act as a hypertrophic stimulus both in vitro and in vivo across myogenic cell types.The signaling events responsible for AngII-mediated hypertrophy have been extensively studied. AngII has been shown to induce several immediate-early genes, such as c-fos, c-jun,egr-1, and c-myc, primarily through the G protein-coupled angiotensin receptor subtype 1 in both myogenic and nonmyogenic cells (2Sadoshima J.

The functional importance of the interaction between the 3′-terminal nucleotide of tRNA and the ribosome was studied in vitro using mutant in vitro transcribed tRNAVal A76G. Val-tRNACCG does not support polypeptide synthesis on poly(GUA) as a message. However, in a co-translation system, where Val-tRNACCG represented only a small fraction of total Val-tRNA, the mutant tRNA is able to transfer valine into a polypeptide chain, albeit at a reduced level. The A76G mutation does not affect binding of Val- or NAcVal-tRNACCGto the A- or P-sites as shown by efficient peptide bond formation, although the donor activity of the mutant NAcVal-tRNACCG in the peptidyl transfer reaction is slightly reduced compared with wild-type NAcVal-tRNA. Translocation of 3′-CCG-tRNA from the P- to the E-site is not significantly influenced. However, the A76G mutation drastically inhibits translocation of peptidyl-tRNA G76 from the ribosomal A-site to the P-site, which apparently explains its failure to support cell-free protein synthesis.

Our results indicate that the identity of the 3′-terminal nucleotide of tRNA is critical for tRNA movement in the ribosome. The 3′-CCA sequence of tRNA is a universal ligand for protein biosynthesis; it is recognized by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, EF-Tu, and 23 S rRNA (1Chladek S. Sprinzl M. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.

Experiments using in vitro transcribed tRNAVal variants demonstrated the importance of the 3′-CCA sequence for aminoacylation (3Liu M. Horowitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The importance of the CCA end in ribosome-catalyzed peptide bond formation is well established (1Chladek S. Sprinzl M. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.

Chemically synthesized aminoacyl oligonucleotides were used to demonstrate the significance of the 3′-CCA sequence as a peptide acceptor during peptide bond formation on ribosomes (8Tezuka M.

These findings were rationalized by showing functional base pairing of C74 with G2252 of 23 S rRNA at the donor site of the ribosomal peptidyltransferase center (10Samaha R.R. Green R. Noller H.F.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2559-2566Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It has also been proposed that substitution of the A76 of tRNA affects binding of deacylated tRNA to the ribosomal E-site (15Lill R. Robertson J.M. Wintermeyer W. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3933-3938Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). These findings show the importance of the 3′-CCA end of tRNA in maintaining the reading frame during translation and suggest that the 3′-CCA end is involved in ribosomal translocation.In this paper, we analyze the functional importance of the 3′-terminal A of tRNA for ribosomal translation. The results show that substitution of the 3′ A of tRNAVal with G blocks translocation of peptidyl-tRNA from the ribosomal A-site to the P-site and inhibits the peptidyl transfer reaction at the ribosomal donor (P) site.MATERIALS AND METHODSPreparation of tRNAs, Poly(GUA), and EnzymesTransfer RNAVal (anticodon UAC) was synthesizedin vitro by T7 RNA polymerase-catalyzed run-off transcription from the phagemid pFVAL119 linearized by FokI (A76) or from pFVALG76 linearized by MspI (16Liu M. Horowitz J. BioTechniques. 1993; 15: 264-266PubMed Google Scholar). This method was shown to produce the expected nucleotide at the 3′-terminus (17Chu W.-C. Horowitz J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 7241-7252Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). tRNAVal variants were purified by size exclusion chromatography on Sephadex G-50 and gel electrophoresis in 7% urea-PAGE. Total E. coli tRNA was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. tRNAs are designated as follows: tRNACCA(in vitro transcribed wild-type tRNAVal), tRNACCG (in vitro transcribed tRNAVal with the mutation A76G), tRNAbulk(total (unfractionated) E. coli tRNA), and tRNAVal (purified isoacceptors of valine-specific E. coli tRNA). 1 μg of tRNAVal was taken as equal to 40 pmol.DNA encoding the sequence poly(GTA)44 was the kind gift of Dr. T. Tenson (University of Tartu). The poly(GTA)44 was amplified by PCR and cloned under the control of the T7 late promoter in pLITMUS38 between the ApaI and EcoRV sites. The plasmid was cleaved by BspTI, and poly(GUA)44 was prepared by in vitrotranscription with T7 RNA polymerase. Poly(GUA) mRNA has the sequence 5′-GGCCCGUAGA(GUA)44. Transcripts were purified by gel filtration chromatography on Sephadex G-50. 1 μg of poly(GUA)44 was taken as equal to 25 pmol.T7 RNA polymerase was purified as described by Davanloo et al. (18Davanloo P. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Studier F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2035-20399Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar) from E. coli strain BL21(DE-3)/pAR1219 (kindly provided by W. Studier, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY). To prepare ValRS(His)6, the ValRS gene was PCR-amplified from Thermus aquaticus genomic DNA using primers GCCATATGGACCTGCCCAAGGCCTAC and CGGCGGCCGCCCCTATTTGGCTGAGGG. Amplified DNA was digested with NdeI and NotI and cloned into pET24A (Novagen) to produce pET24A-VTA. ValRS(His)6 was expressed in BL21/(DE3) and purified using a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column (QiaExpressionist). The enzyme was stored at −80 °C in buffer containing 20 mmTris·HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 6 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 50% glycerol.Plasmid encoding E. coli elongation factor EF-Tu-His (pKECA) was kindly provided by Dr. B.

EF-G-His expression plasmid (pRSET) was a kind gift from Dr. M. Rodnina (20Semenkov Y.P. Rodnina M.V. Wintermeyer W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12183-12188Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The elongation factors were expressed and purified as described (19Boon K. Vijgenboom E. Madsen L.V. Talens A. Kraal B. Bosch L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar).AminoacylationTransfer RNAs were aminoacylated by T. aquaticusValRS as described by Liu and Horowitz (3Liu M. Horowitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10389-10393Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), using [3H]Val or [14C]Val (Amersham Biosciences) with specific activities of 30,000 and 500 dpm/pmol, respectively. Charging levels were 20–25 pmol of Val/μg of tRNA for in vitrotranscribed tRNA variants and 1.5 pmol of Val/μg of total E. coli tRNA. N-Acetylation of Val-tRNA variants was according to Haenni and Chapeville (21Haenni A.L. Chapeville F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 114: 135-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar).In Vitro Poly(GUA)-directed TranslationRibosomes were isolated according to Rodnina and Wintermeyer (22Rodnina M.V. Wintermeyer W. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1945-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In vitro translation assays were carried out in buffer A (20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.6, 160 mmNH4Cl, 12 mm MgCl2, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol), essentially as described by Gavrilova et al. (23Gavrilova L.P. Kostiashkina O.E. Koteliansky V.E. Rutkevitch N.M Spirin A.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 101: 537-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Translation initiation complexes (mix R) were prepared by mixing 25 pmol of poly(GUA)44, as mRNA, with 10 pmol of 70 S ribosomes in 15 μl of buffer A and incubating at 37 °C for 10 min. Mix T, which contained (in 20 μl of buffer A) 0–40 pmol of Val-tRNA variant, 10 μg of EF-Tu, 2 μg of EF-G, and 2.5 mm GTP, was incubated for 5 min at 30 °C. In co-translation experiments, mix R contained 0–8 pmol of ribosomes, 1 pmol of [3H]Val-tRNA variant, and 25 pmol of poly(GUA); mix T contained 20 pmol of E. colitRNAbulk, charged with [14C]Val, elongation factors, and GTP as above. If NAcVal-tRNA variants were used to initiate translation, mix R contained 20 pmol of NAc[3H]Val-tRNACCA or NAc[3H]Val-tRNACCG, 10 pmol of ribosomes, and 25 pmol of poly(GUA); mix T contained 0–40 pmol of [14C]Val-tRNA variant, elongation factors, and GTP. Both elongation factors were at saturating concentrations to avoid factor-dependent effects.In all translation experiments, reactions were started by combining mix R with mix T. After a 20-min incubation at 37 °C, the reactions were stopped by the addition of 1.5 ml of 5% trichloroacetic acid, and the samples were heated at 95 °C for 20 min. Precipitates were collected on glass fiber filters, which were dried and counted in a scintillation spectrometer.Dipeptide Synthesis AssayAcceptor and donor activities of Val-tRNA in ribosomal peptide bond formation were analyzed by measuring dipeptide synthesis (in the absence of EF-G) using in vitro transcribed Val-tRNA and NAcVal-tRNA variants. Two mixes were prepared. Mix R, containing (per 30 μl) 25 pmol of poly(GUA)44, 5 pmol of 70 S ribosomes, and 10 pmol of NAc[3H]Val-tRNA in buffer A, was preincubated for 10 min at 37 °C. Mix T, containing (per 20 μl) 0–8 pmol of [14C]Val-tRNA, 220 pmol of EF-Tu, 2.5 mm GTP, 2.5 mm PEP, and 10 units of PEP kinase in buffer A, was preincubated 5 min at 30 °C. Dipeptide bond formation was initiated by combining mix R and mix T. After incubating for 10 min at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of NaOH to a final concentration of 0.6 m. Samples were further incubated for 20 min at 37 °C to hydrolyze aminoacyl- and peptidyl-tRNA and 200 μl of 5 n H2SO4 were then added to lower the pH to <1. Finally, 1 ml of ethyl acetate was added with vigorous mixing. At the low pH, free NAc[3H]Val and the dipeptide NAc[3H]Val-[14C]Val are extracted into the organic phase, whereas [14C]Val remains in the water phase. Therefore, [14C] counts in the ethyl acetate phase are a measure of the NAc[3H]Val-[14C]Val formed. Under conditions of the experiment, no trichloroacetic acid-precipitable peptides were found, indicating that longer peptide chains are not formed.TranslocationEF-G-dependent translocation was analyzed according to Watanabe (24Watanabe S. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 67: 443-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).A- to P-site TranslocationTo assay the effect of G76 on the translocation of tRNA from the ribosomal A-site to the P-site, the ribosomal P- and E-sites were filled with deacylated tRNACCA in the presence of poly(GUA) by incubating 20 μl of mix R, containing 5 pmol of 70 S ribosomes, 25 pmol of poly(GUA)44, 20 pmol of tRNACCA in buffer A (final Mg2+ concentration, 12 mm) at 37 °C. After 10 min, 10 pmol of either NAc[3H]Val-tRNACCA or NAc[3H]Val-tRNACCG, were added and allowed to bind to the ribosomal A-site by incubation at 37 °C for 20 min. The amount of NAc[3H]Val-tRNACCA bound was determined by nitrocellulose filter assay (25Spahn C.M.T. Remme J. Schäfer M. Nierhaus K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32849-32856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Translocation was promoted by the addition of variable amounts of EF-G (0–2.5 pmol) and 1 mm GTP (final concentration) and incubating for either 10 min at 37 °C or 2 h on ice (final volume, 35 μl). At the end of the incubation period, all tubes were placed on ice. Similar results were obtained when the experiment was performed at 15 or 20 mm Mg2+.The amount of translocation was determined by measuring P-site bound NAc[3H]-Val-tRNACCA or NAc[3H]-Val-tRNACCG with the puromycin reaction. Mixes were incubated in the presence of 1 mmpuromycin at 0 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of sodium hydroxide (0.6 m final concentration) and incubated 15 min at 37 °C to hydrolyze any remaining aminoacyl-tRNA. After neutralization with 0.2 ml of 1 mpotassium phosphate (pH 7.6) NAc[3H]Val-puromycin was extracted with 1 ml of ethyl acetate. The amount of NAc[3H]Val-puromycin formed was determined by scintillation counting of the ethyl acetate phase.P- to E-site TranslocationThis assay is similar to that of the A- to P-site translocation assay except that the ribosomal P- and E-sites were occupied with either deacylated tRNACCA or deacylated tRNACCG in the presence of poly(GUA) by preincubating 25 μl of mix R (5 pmol of 70 S ribosomes, 25 pmol of poly(GUA)44, 20 pmol of tRNACCA or tRNACCG in buffer A) at 37 °C for 10 min. Subsequently, 10 pmol of NAc[3H]Val-tRNACCA were added and allowed to bind to the ribosomal A-site at 37 °C for 20 min. Translocation was initiated as described for the A- to P-site translocation assay, and the amount of NAc[3H]Val-tRNACCA translocated to the P-site was measured by the puromycin reaction. The A-site tRNA can only go to the P-site after P to E translocation has occurred; thus, if tRNACCG blocks this movement, then A to P translocation cannot occur.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have examined the functional role of the 3′-terminal nucleotide of tRNAVal in ribosomal translation by comparing the activity of in vitro transcribed wild-type tRNAVal (A76) with that of the G76 mutant in translation of the cognate (GUA) codon and in individual steps of the polypeptide elongation cycle. Our results show that the G76 Val-tRNAVal mutant is completely inactive in poly(GUA)-directed translation when present alone (Fig. 1), suggesting that the A76G mutation affects a step in polypeptide synthesis on the ribosome. Co-translation experiments, carried out in the presence of excess native (A76) tRNAVal, demonstrate that the mutant tRNACCG can function in poly(GUA)-directed translation although with reduced efficiency (Fig. 2 A).To identify the step affected by the G76 mutation, each phase of the polypeptide elongation cycle was individually investigated. Studies of the activity of tRNACCG in dipeptide synthesis show that the G76 mutation does not significantly affect the acceptor activity of Val-tRNA in the peptidyltransferase reaction (Fig. 4 A). Substitutions in the CCA sequence have also been shown to have only small effects on the acceptor activity of aminoacyl-oligonucleotides in the peptidyl transfer reaction (8Tezuka M. Chladek S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 667-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar).In contrast, the donor activity of NAcVal-tRNACCG is reduced by 20–30% compared with that of NAcVal-tRNACCA in both poly(GUA)-directed translation (Fig. 3) and in the dipeptide synthesis assay (Fig. 4 B). Evidently, the identity of the 3′-nucleotide of tRNA is more important at the donor site and less important at the acceptor site of the ribosomal peptidyltransferase center. Crystallographic data of aminoacyl- and peptidyl-tRNA analogs bound to Haloarcula marismortui 50 S ribosomes (7Nissen P. Hansen J. Ban N. Moore P.B. Steitz T.A. Science. 2000; 289: 920-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1736) Google Scholar) indicate that N-1 of A76 of the tRNA at the donor site acts as a hydrogen bond acceptor from the 2′-OH of A2450 of the 23 S rRNA and the base stacks on the ribose of A2451. A guanine at position 76 of tRNA can still stack efficiently on the ribose of A2451 but will have difficulty forming the appropriate hydrogen bonds with the 2′-OH group of A2450because its N-1 is protonated, unlike that of A76. This may account for the reduced donor activity of the G76 variant of tRNAVal at the peptidyl transfer center.It has been proposed that binding of tRNA to the E-site promotes movement of the tRNA-mRNA complex with respect to the ribosome (15Lill R. Robertson J.M. Wintermeyer W. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3933-3938Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The removal or substitution of A76 decreases the affinity of the ribosomal E-site for tRNA at least 100-fold (15Lill R. Robertson J.M. Wintermeyer W. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3933-3938Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 32Grajevskaja R.A. Ivanov Y.V. Saminski E.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 128: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar,35Boccheta M. Xiong L. Shah S. Mankin A.S. RNA. 2001; 7: 54-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Failure of the G76 mutant of tRNAVal to translate poly(GUA) may be due to the inability of the G76mutant to bind correctly to the E-site, thus blocking movement of tRNA from the P- to the E-site. Our results, however, reveal that the A76G mutation does not interfere with the translocation of tRNA from the P-site to the E-site (Fig. 6 B). In this connection, it is interesting to note that the 3′-end of deacylated tRNA that is formed after transpeptidation does not immediately progress to the E-site but remains temporarily at the peptidyltransferase center, as shown by recent cross-linking experiments (6Wower J. Kirillov S.V. Wower I.K. Guven S. Hixon S.S. Zimmermann R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37887-37894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). It is possible that the G76 tRNAVal mutant can dissociate from ribosomal P-site without stably binding to the E-site.The most striking result of the A76 to G76substitution in tRNAVal is the nearly complete inhibition of A- to P-site tRNA translocation. The experiments presented in Fig. 5clearly demonstrate that translocation of the peptidyl-tRNA analog, NAc[3H]Val-tRNA, from the A- to the P-site is severely inhibited by the A76G mutation, thus accounting for the inability of the G76 mutant of tRNAVal to translate poly(GUA). This result is in contrast to the ability of the G76 mutant of tRNAVal to bind to both the A- and the P-sites, as inferred from its activity both as an acceptor and a donor in peptide bond formation (Fig. 4). According to the hybrid state model, the 3′-end of tRNA moves concomitantly with peptide bond formation from the acceptor to the donor site leading to the P/A hybrid state (36Moazed D. Noller H.F. Nature. 1989; 342: 142-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). This movement and the related conformational changes (37Yusupov M.M. Yusupova G.Zh. Baucom A. Lieberman K. Earnest T.N. Cate J.H.D. Noller H.F. Science. 2001; 292: 883-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (1649) Google Scholar) are expected to depend on correct interaction between the CCA end of tRNA and 23 S rRNA. The affinity of aminoacyl-oligonucleotides for the ribosomal donor site is higher by 1 order of magnitude compared with the acceptor site (38Streltsov S. Kosenjuk A. Kukhanova M. Krayevsky A. Gottikh B. FEBS Lett. 1979; 104: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 39Bourd S.B. Kukhanova M.K. Gottikh B.P. Krayevsky A.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 135: 465-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). This affinity gradient can be essential for movement of the CCA end of peptidyl-tRNA during translocation (40Leder P. Adv. Protein Chem. 1973; 27: 213-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). If the G76 variant of peptidyl-tRNA does not bind correctly to the ribosomal donor site, as implied by its reduced donor activity (Figs. 3 and 4 B), it can affect movement of the CCA end of tRNA and thereby inhibit translocation. On the other hand, it is possible that A76 of peptidyl-tRNA is specifically recognized by 23 S rRNA or a ribosomal protein during the translocation reaction. One candidate for such recognition is nucleotide A2602, which is disordered in the empty 50 S subunit and becomes positioned between the CCA bound at the A-site and the CCA bound at the P-site after tRNA binding (7Nissen P. Hansen J. Ban N. Moore P.B. Steitz T.A. Science. 2000; 289: 920-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1736) Google Scholar). A second candidate is ribosomal protein L27, which can be cross-linked to A76 at both the A- and the P-sites (41Wower J. Wower I.K. Kirillov S. Rosen K. Hixon S.S. Zimmermann R.A. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 73: 1041-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).Feinberg and Joseph have recently identified two 2′-OH groups, at positions 71 and 76, which are required for tRNA translocation from the P- to the E-site (42Feinberg J.S. Joseph S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11120-11125Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This result is in agreement with the finding that 2′-deoxy-A76-substituted tRNA inhibits ribosomal translocation (43Wagner T. Sprinzl M. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We have shown that the adenosine at position 76 of tRNA is essential for translocation from the A- to the P-site (Fig. 5). The importance of specific functional groups of tRNA for movement from the A-site to the P-site and from the P-site to the E-site suggests an active ribosomal mechanism for translocation, with essential transient interactions between tRNA and the ribosome. The 3′-CCA sequence of tRNA is a universal ligand for protein biosynthesis; it is recognized by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, EF-Tu, and 23 S rRNA (1Chladek S. Sprinzl M. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Eng. 1985; 24: 371-391Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 2Green R. Noller H.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 679-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Experiments using in vitro transcribed tRNAVal variants demonstrated the importance of the 3′-CCA sequence for aminoacylation (3Liu M. Horowitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10389-10393Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 4Tamura K. Nobukazu N. Tsunemi H. Shimizu M. Himeno H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22173-22177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and its significance in formation of the ternary complex between Val-tRNA, EF-Tu, and GTP (5Liu J. Liu M. Horowitz J. RNA. 1998; 4: 639-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). On ribosomes, the CCA end of tRNA interacts with 23 S rRNA at all ribosomal tRNA binding sites (6Wower J. Kirillov S.V. Wower I.K. Guven S. Hixon S.S. Zimmermann R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37887-37894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The importance of the CCA end in ribosome-catalyzed peptide bond formation is well established (1Chladek S. Sprinzl M. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Eng. 1985; 24: 371-391Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 7Nissen P. Hansen J. Ban N. Moore P.B. Steitz T.A. Science. 2000; 289: 920-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1736) Google Scholar). Chemically synthesized aminoacyl oligonucleotides were used to demonstrate the significance of the 3′-CCA sequence as a peptide acceptor during peptide bond formation on ribosomes (8Tezuka M. Chladek S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 667-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). E. colitRNAVal with mutations in the 3′-CCA sequence inhibits the peptidyltransferase activity of the ribosome (9Tamura K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). These findings were rationalized by showing functional base pairing of C74 with G2252 of 23 S rRNA at the donor site of the ribosomal peptidyltransferase center (10Samaha R.R. Green R. Noller H.F. Nature. 1995; 377: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) and of C75 with G2553 at the acceptor site (11Green R. Switzer C. Noller H.F. Science. 1998; 280: 286-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 12Kim D.F. Green R.

Mutation of C74 to U74 in tRNAHisderepresses the histidine biosynthetic operon of Salmonella typhimurium (14O'Connor M. Willis N.M. Bossi L. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2559-2566Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Mutants of Escherichia coli tRNA1Val with 3′-GCA or 3′-ACA promote −1 frameshifting and suppress a wide variety of nonsense mutants (14O'Connor M. Willis N.M. Bossi L. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2559-2566Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It has also been proposed that substitution of the A76 of tRNA affects binding of deacylated tRNA to the ribosomal E-site (15Lill R. Robertson J.M. Wintermeyer W. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3933-3938Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). These findings show the importance of the 3′-CCA end of tRNA in maintaining the reading frame during translation and suggest that the 3′-CCA end is involved in ribosomal translocation. In this paper, we analyze the functional importance of the 3′-terminal A of tRNA for ribosomal translation. The results show that substitution of the 3′ A of tRNAVal with G blocks translocation of peptidyl-tRNA from the ribosomal A-site to the P-site and inhibits the peptidyl transfer reaction at the ribosomal donor (P) site. MATERIALS AND METHODSPreparation of tRNAs, Poly(GUA), and EnzymesTransfer RNAVal (anticodon UAC) was synthesizedin vitro by T7 RNA polymerase-catalyzed run-off transcription from the phagemid pFVAL119 linearized by FokI (A76) or from pFVALG76 linearized by MspI (16Liu M. Horowitz J. BioTechniques. 1993; 15: 264-266PubMed Google Scholar). This method was shown to produce the expected nucleotide at the 3′-terminus (17Chu W.-C. Horowitz J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 7241-7252Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). tRNAVal variants were purified by size exclusion chromatography on Sephadex G-50 and gel electrophoresis in 7% urea-PAGE. Total E. coli tRNA was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. tRNAs are designated as follows: tRNACCA(in vitro transcribed wild-type tRNAVal), tRNACCG (in vitro transcribed tRNAVal with the mutation A76G), tRNAbulk(total (unfractionated) E. coli tRNA), and tRNAVal (purified isoacceptors of valine-specific E. coli tRNA). 1 μg of tRNAVal was taken as equal to 40 pmol.DNA encoding the sequence poly(GTA)44 was the kind gift of Dr. T. Tenson (University of Tartu). The poly(GTA)44 was amplified by PCR and cloned under the control of the T7 late promoter in pLITMUS38 between the ApaI and EcoRV sites. The plasmid was cleaved by BspTI, and poly(GUA)44 was prepared by in vitrotranscription with T7 RNA polymerase. Poly(GUA) mRNA has the sequence 5′-GGCCCGUAGA(GUA)44. Transcripts were purified by gel filtration chromatography on Sephadex G-50. 1 μg of poly(GUA)44 was taken as equal to 25 pmol.T7 RNA polymerase was purified as described by Davanloo et al. (18Davanloo P. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Studier F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

https://openalex.org/W2102657883,"Reciprocal transmission between epithelia and sensory neurons of the peripheral nervous system is a crucial step in the life cycle of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and related alphaherpesviruses. In searching for an easy-to-perform and generally applicable experimental approach that enables the direct analysis of virus transfer between primary epithelial cells and sensory neurites, we investigated the spread of HSV-1 in a dual-chamber organ model comprising chick embryonic corneal epithelia and trigeminal sensory neurons. Embryonic chick corneal and trigeminal tissues were found to be permissive for productive infection with HSV-1. Our data show that HSV-1 efficiently enters neurites re-innervating the cornea and reaches the ganglion explant by retrograde axonal transport, with the first antigen-positive cells being detectable approximately 12 h postinfection. After direct infection of trigeminal tissues, the virus is transported by anterograde axonal transport to the corneal epithelium, causing a visible cytopathic effect approximately 48 h postinfection. These results suggest that the organ model presented in this study holds particular promise for the direct observation and molecular analysis of herpes simplex virus spread between primary epithelia and sensory neurons and that it may be an attractive alternative to current experimental approaches based on laboratory animals or human fetal tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2312344049,"Bax is an oncogene that has proapoptotic properties but not all cells that express Bax undergo apoptosis. Bax may have a function unrelated to apoptosis. To elucidate the role of Bax in cell signaling, an epithelial cell line called SMG-C6 was transfected with the human bax gene. Stable transfectants were studied for their response to carbachol, a muscarinic receptor agonist, by measuring the increase in intracellular free Ca(2+) and Ca(2+) influx. Carbachol-mediated release of Ca(2+) from intracellular stores was significantly higher in Bax transfectants compared to control transfectants (empty vector). Ca(2+) influx was also increased in Bax transfectants. Bax had no affect on the storage operated channels. However, the concentration of Ca(2+) in the intracellular stores (i.e., mitochondria and granules) was 40-50% lower in the Bax transfectants. There was no significant difference in thapsigargin-mediated apoptosis in Bax transfectants compared to wild-type and control transfectants. Measurement of glutathione was reduced in the Bax transfectant. Restoration of glutathione levels with glutathione monoethyl ester partially normalized Ca(2+) mobilization and storage capacity in the mitochondria to control levels. This study shows that sub-apoptotic levels of Bax can reduce Ca(2+) content in intracellular stores and Ca(2+) homeostasis. Bax may mediate these effects by reducing the levels of antioxidants resulting in mild oxidative stress."
