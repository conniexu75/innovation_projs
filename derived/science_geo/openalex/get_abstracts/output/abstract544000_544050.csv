https://openalex.org/W2146177965,"There are few in vitro models of exocrine pancreas development and primary human pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC). We establish three-dimensional culture conditions to induce the differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells into exocrine progenitor organoids that form ductal and acinar structures in culture and in vivo. Expression of mutant KRAS or TP53 in progenitor organoids induces mutation-specific phenotypes in culture and in vivo. Expression of TP53(R175H) induces cytosolic SOX9 localization. In patient tumors bearing TP53 mutations, SOX9 was cytoplasmic and associated with mortality. We also define culture conditions for clonal generation of tumor organoids from freshly resected PDAC. Tumor organoids maintain the differentiation status, histoarchitecture and phenotypic heterogeneity of the primary tumor and retain patient-specific physiological changes, including hypoxia, oxygen consumption, epigenetic marks and differences in sensitivity to inhibition of the histone methyltransferase EZH2. Thus, pancreatic progenitor organoids and tumor organoids can be used to model PDAC and for drug screening to identify precision therapy strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2144733364,"The efficacy of vaccine adjuvants such as Toll-like receptor agonists (TLRa) can be improved through formulation and delivery approaches. Here, we attached small molecule TLR-7/8a to polymer scaffolds (polymer-TLR-7/8a) and evaluated how different physicochemical properties of the TLR-7/8a and polymer carrier influenced the location, magnitude and duration of innate immune activation in vivo. Particle formation by polymer-TLR-7/8a was the most important factor for restricting adjuvant distribution and prolonging activity in draining lymph nodes. The improved pharmacokinetic profile by particulate polymer-TLR-7/8a was also associated with reduced morbidity and enhanced vaccine immunogenicity for inducing antibodies and T cell immunity. We extended these findings to the development of a modular approach in which protein antigens are site-specifically linked to temperature-responsive polymer-TLR-7/8a adjuvants that self-assemble into immunogenic particles at physiologic temperatures in vivo. Our findings provide a chemical and structural basis for optimizing adjuvant design to elicit broad-based antibody and T cell responses with protein antigens."
https://openalex.org/W1918079945,"Despite the success of protein kinase inhibitors as approved therapeutics, drug discovery has focused on a small subset of kinase targets. Here we provide a thorough characterization of the Published Kinase Inhibitor Set (PKIS), a set of 367 small-molecule ATP-competitive kinase inhibitors that was recently made freely available with the aim of expanding research in this field and as an experiment in open-source target validation. We screen the set in activity assays with 224 recombinant kinases and 24 G protein-coupled receptors and in cellular assays of cancer cell proliferation and angiogenesis. We identify chemical starting points for designing new chemical probes of orphan kinases and illustrate the utility of these leads by developing a selective inhibitor for the previously untargeted kinases LOK and SLK. Our cellular screens reveal compounds that modulate cancer cell growth and angiogenesis in vitro. These reagents and associated data illustrate an efficient way forward to increasing understanding of the historically untargeted kinome."
https://openalex.org/W2210094278,"Human induced pluripotent stem cells show no consistent differences from human embryonic stem cells in a study that controls for several sources of variability. The equivalence of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) and human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) remains controversial. Here we use genetically matched hESC and hiPSC lines to assess the contribution of cellular origin (hESC vs. hiPSC), the Sendai virus (SeV) reprogramming method and genetic background to transcriptional and DNA methylation patterns while controlling for cell line clonality and sex. We find that transcriptional and epigenetic variation originating from genetic background dominates over variation due to cellular origin or SeV infection. Moreover, the 49 differentially expressed genes we detect between genetically matched hESCs and hiPSCs neither predict functional outcome nor distinguish an independently derived, larger set of unmatched hESC and hiPSC lines. We conclude that hESCs and hiPSCs are molecularly and functionally equivalent and cannot be distinguished by a consistent gene expression signature. Our data further imply that genetic background variation is a major confounding factor for transcriptional and epigenetic comparisons of pluripotent cell lines, explaining some of the previously observed differences between genetically unmatched hESCs and hiPSCs."
https://openalex.org/W2156765375,"Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have linked genes to various pathological traits. However, the potential contribution of regulatory noncoding RNAs, such as microRNAs (miRNAs), to a genetic predisposition to pathological conditions has remained unclear. We leveraged GWAS meta-analysis data from >188,000 individuals to identify 69 miRNAs in physical proximity to single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with abnormal levels of circulating lipids. Several of these miRNAs (miR-128-1, miR-148a, miR-130b, and miR-301b) control the expression of key proteins involved in cholesterol-lipoprotein trafficking, such as the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (LDLR) and the ATP-binding cassette A1 (ABCA1) cholesterol transporter. Consistent with human liver expression data and genetic links to abnormal blood lipid levels, overexpression and antisense targeting of miR-128-1 or miR-148a in high-fat diet-fed C57BL/6J and Apoe-null mice resulted in altered hepatic expression of proteins involved in lipid trafficking and metabolism, and in modulated levels of circulating lipoprotein-cholesterol and triglycerides. Taken together, these findings support the notion that altered expression of miRNAs may contribute to abnormal blood lipid levels, predisposing individuals to human cardiometabolic disorders."

https://openalex.org/W2103659644,"Research on human pluripotent stem cells has been hampered by the lack of a standardized, quantitative, scalable assay of pluripotency. We previously described an assay called ScoreCard that used gene expression signatures to quantify differentiation efficiency. Here we report an improved version of the assay based on qPCR that enables faster, more quantitative assessment of functional pluripotency. We provide an in-depth characterization of the revised signature panel (commercially available as the TaqMan hPSC Scorecard Assay) through embryoid body and directed differentiation experiments as well as a detailed comparison to the teratoma assay. We further show that the improved ScoreCard enables a wider range of applications, such as screening of small molecules, genetic perturbations and assessment of culture conditions. Our approach can be extended beyond stem cell applications to characterize and assess the utility of other cell types and lineages."

https://openalex.org/W2155574916,"Background Analyzing high throughput genomics data is a complex and compute intensive task, generally requiring numerous software tools and large reference data sets, tied together in successive stages of data transformation and visualisation. A computational platform enabling best practice genomics analysis ideally meets a number of requirements, including: a wide range of analysis and visualisation tools, closely linked to large user and reference data sets; workflow platform(s) enabling accessible, reproducible, portable analyses, through a flexible set of interfaces; highly available, scalable computational resources; and flexibility and versatility in the use of these resources to meet demands and expertise of a variety of users. Access to an appropriate computational platform can be a significant barrier to researchers, as establishing such a platform requires a large upfront investment in hardware, experience, and expertise. Results We designed and implemented the Genomics Virtual Laboratory (GVL) as a middleware layer of machine images, cloud management tools, and online services that enable researchers to build arbitrarily sized compute clusters on demand, pre-populated with fully configured bioinformatics tools, reference datasets and workflow and visualisation options. The platform is flexible in that users can conduct analyses through web-based (Galaxy, RStudio, IPython Notebook) or command-line interfaces, and add/remove compute nodes and data resources as required. Best-practice tutorials and protocols provide a path from introductory training to practice. The GVL is available on the OpenStack-based Australian Research Cloud (http://nectar.org.au) and the Amazon Web Services cloud. The principles, implementation and build process are designed to be cloud-agnostic. Conclusions This paper provides a blueprint for the design and implementation of a cloud-based Genomics Virtual Laboratory. We discuss scope, design considerations and technical and logistical constraints, and explore the value added to the research community through the suite of services and resources provided by our implementation."
https://openalex.org/W1855020712,"Na+ can be stored in muscle and skin without commensurate water accumulation. The aim of this study was to assess Na+ and H2O in muscle and skin with MRI in acute heart failure patients before and after diuretic treatment and in a healthy cohort.Nine patients (mean age 78 years; range 58-87) and nine age and gender-matched controls were studied. They underwent 23Na/1H-MRI at the calf with a custom-made knee coil. Patients were studied before and after diuretic therapy. 23Na-MRI gray-scale measurements of Na+-phantoms served to quantify Na+-concentrations. A fat-suppressed inversion recovery sequence was used to quantify H2O content.Plasma Na+-levels did not change during therapy. Mean Na+-concentrations in muscle and skin decreased after furosemide therapy (before therapy: 30.7±6.4 and 43.5±14.5 mmol/L; after therapy: 24.2±6.1 and 32.2±12.0 mmol/L; p˂0.05 and p˂0.01). Water content measurements did not differ significantly before and after furosemide therapy in muscle (p = 0.17) and only tended to be reduced in skin (p = 0.06). Na+-concentrations in calf muscle and skin of patients before and after diuretic therapy were significantly higher than in healthy subjects (18.3±2.5 and 21.1±2.3 mmol/L).23Na-MRI shows accumulation of Na+ in muscle and skin in patients with acute heart failure. Diuretic treatment can mobilize this Na+-deposition; however, contrary to expectations, water and Na+-mobilization are poorly correlated."
https://openalex.org/W2156166634,"Deforestation and conversion of native habitats continues to be the leading driver of biodiversity and ecosystem service loss. A number of conservation policies and programs are implemented--from protected areas to payments for ecosystem services (PES)--to deter these losses. Currently, empirical evidence on whether these approaches stop or slow land cover change is lacking, but there is increasing interest in conducting rigorous, counterfactual impact evaluations, especially for many new conservation approaches, such as PES and REDD, which emphasize additionality. In addition, several new, globally available and free high-resolution remote sensing datasets have increased the ease of carrying out an impact evaluation on land cover change outcomes. While the number of conservation evaluations utilizing 'matching' to construct a valid control group is increasing, the majority of these studies use simple differences in means or linear cross-sectional regression to estimate the impact of the conservation program using this matched sample, with relatively few utilizing fixed effects panel methods--an alternative estimation method that relies on temporal variation in the data. In this paper we compare the advantages and limitations of (1) matching to construct the control group combined with differences in means and cross-sectional regression, which control for observable forms of bias in program evaluation, to (2) fixed effects panel methods, which control for observable and time-invariant unobservable forms of bias, with and without matching to create the control group. We then use these four approaches to estimate forest cover outcomes for two conservation programs: a PES program in Northeastern Ecuador and strict protected areas in European Russia. In the Russia case we find statistically significant differences across estimators--due to the presence of unobservable bias--that lead to differences in conclusions about effectiveness. The Ecuador case illustrates that if time-invariant unobservables are not present, matching combined with differences in means or cross-sectional regression leads to similar estimates of program effectiveness as matching combined with fixed effects panel regression. These results highlight the importance of considering observable and unobservable forms of bias and the methodological assumptions across estimators when designing an impact evaluation of conservation programs."
https://openalex.org/W1834506558,"Exposure to lower-than-therapeutic levels of anti-tuberculosis drugs is likely to cause selection of resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and treatment failure. The first-line anti-tuberculosis (TB) regimen consists of rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol, and correct management reduces risk of TB relapse and development of drug resistance. In this study we aimed to investigate the effect of standard of care plus nutritional supplementation versus standard care on the pharmacokinetics of isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethambutol among sputum smear positive TB patients with and without HIV. In a clinical trial in 100 Tanzanian TB patients, with or without HIV infection, drug concentrations were determined at 1 week and 2 months post initiation of anti-TB medication. Data was analysed using population pharmacokinetic modelling. The effect of body size was described using allometric scaling, and the effects of nutritional supplementation, HIV, age, sex, CD4+ count, weight-adjusted dose, NAT2 genotype, and time on TB treatment were investigated. The kinetics of all drugs was well characterised using first-order elimination and transit compartment absorption, with isoniazid and ethambutol described by two-compartment disposition models, and pyrazinamide by a one-compartment model. Patients with a slow NAT2 genotype had higher isoniazid exposure and a lower estimate of oral clearance (15.5 L/h) than rapid/intermediate NAT2 genotype (26.1 L/h). Pyrazinamide clearance had an estimated typical value of 3.32 L/h, and it was found to increase with time on treatment, with a 16.3% increase after the first 2 months of anti-TB treatment. The typical clearance of ethambutol was estimated to be 40.7 L/h, and was found to decrease with age, at a rate of 1.41% per year. Neither HIV status nor nutritional supplementations were found to affect the pharmacokinetics of these drugs in our cohort of patients."
https://openalex.org/W2287193949,"The non-canonical WNT/planar cell polarity (WNT/PCP) pathway plays important roles in morphogenetic processes in vertebrates. Among WNT/PCP components, protein tyrosine kinase 7 (PTK7) is a tyrosine kinase receptor with poorly defined functions lacking catalytic activity. Here we show that PTK7 associates with receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 2 (ROR2) to form a heterodimeric complex in mammalian cells. We demonstrate that PTK7 and ROR2 physically and functionally interact with the non-canonical WNT5A ligand, leading to JNK activation and cell movements. In the Xenopus embryo, Ptk7 functionally interacts with Ror2 to regulate protocadherin papc expression and morphogenesis. Furthermore, we show that Ptk7 is required for papc activation induced by Wnt5a. Interestingly, we find that Wnt5a stimulates the release of the tagged Ptk7 intracellular domain, which can translocate into the nucleus and activate papc expression.

Its importance in development is best highlighted by its role in convergence extension cell movements during gastrulation that are necessary for the proper elongation of the anterior-posterior body axis. PCP serves also to orient apical structures or groups of cells within the plane of the epithelium and drives oriented cell migration of epithelial and non-epithelial cell types (1.Montcouquiol M.

PCP is assigned molecularly to a non-canonical WNT pathway (hereafter named the WNT/PCP pathway) that, in contrast to the canonical WNT pathway, does not involve the transcriptional regulator β-catenin. WNT/PCP utilizes small Rho-like GTPases and JNK to promote actin cytoskeleton reorganization and cellular movements (5.Schlessinger K. Hall A. Tolwinski N. Wnt signaling pathways meet Rho GTPases.Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 265-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Several WNT/PCP genes have been isolated from various species and have been shown to encode conserved proteins across evolution at the molecular and functional levels (6.Strutt D.

Overall, how PTK7 transduces a WNT/PCP signaling cascade from the plasma membrane remains largely unknown. In analogy to poorly active RTKs that heterodimerize with heterologous active RTKs to transmit a signal (23.Boudeau J. Miranda-Saavedra D. Barton G.J. Alessi D.R. Emerging roles of pseudokinases.Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 443-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that PTK7 may utilize such a means to propagate WNT/PCP functions. We focused on ROR2, a catalytically active RTK that, upon binding to non-canonical WNT5A, triggers WNT/PCP functions in Xenopus and in the mouse (24.Minami Y. Oishi I. Endo M. Nishita M. Ror-family receptor tyrosine kinases in noncanonical Wnt signaling: their implications in developmental morphogenesis and human diseases.Dev. Dyn. 2010; 239: 1-15PubMed Google Scholar). We find that PTK7 and ROR2 form a heterodimeric complex and that PTK7, like ROR2, binds to WNT5A and promotes JNK phosphorylation and cell movements in mammalian cells. In Xenopus, Ptk7 and Ror2 interact functionally and regulate the expression of paraxial protocadherin (papc), a gene that coordinates the polarity of cells during morphogenetic movements (25.Schambony A.

Synthetic capped mRNAs were produced with the Ambion (Applied Biosystems) mMessage mMachine kit. Xenopus PTK7-FL-Venus and Xenopus PTK7-ICD-Venus fusions were cloned into the pSpE3 vector, and capped mRNAs were synthesized with T3 polymerase after plasmid linearization with SfiI. For Wnt5a- and mRFP-capped RNA, Wnt5a in pCS2+ (provided by H. Steinbeisser) and mRFP in pCS2+ were linearized with Not1 and transcribed with Sp6. For immunofluorescence staining, whole gastrula embryos were blocked in 15% serum and incubated with anti-Venus and anti-RFP antibodies overnight at 4 °C, followed by 90-min incubation in Alexa Fluor 568 (anti-mouse) and Alexa Fluor 488 (anti-chick) fluorophore-conjugated antibodies. The injected ectoderm was explanted and mounted in Fluoromount for confocal analysis, and imaging was performed using a Zeiss LSM 780 microscope. The ROR2 siRNA sequences used were as follows: ROR2 siRNA1, 5′-GCAA T G T GC T AG T G T ACGA TT-3′; ROR2 siRNA2, 5′-TAAAGGGTCGTTCGGATCCAGAACC-3′. Non-targeting siRNA controls were used (Life Technologies). Transfection with siRNAs was carried out with RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) as recommended by the supplier. Monoclonal rat and polyclonal rabbit antibodies to PTK7 (1G9 and KN) were generated in the laboratory. Other antibodies used in this study according to the recommendations of the manufacturers were as follows: mouse antibody to α-tubulin (Sigma, catalog no. B512), rabbit antibody to Thr-183/Tyr-185 SAPK (stress-activated protein kinase)/JNK (Cell Signaling Technology, catalog no. 9251), polyclonal rabbit antibody to JNK (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalog no. sc-571), monoclonal mouse antibody to FLAG (Sigma, catalog no.

MMS-101R-500), and secondary antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Recombinant human WNT5A was purchased from R&D Systems (catalog no. 645-WN-010). Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 25 mm NaF, and 10 μm ZnCl2) supplemented with 0.5 mm PMSF, 1 mm orthovanadate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich). For immunoprecipitation, after preclearing with agarose beads and incubation with antibodies, protein G-agarose beads were added to the lysates, and bound immune complexes were recovered and washed three times in lysis buffer. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose filters, blocked for 1 h at room temperature in Tris-buffered saline/5% nonfat dry milk/0.1% Tween 20, and blotted overnight with primary antibodies in blocking solution. After extensive washings in TBS/0.1% Tween 20, filters were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with an HRP-conjugated secondary antibody before being revealed with an enhanced chemiluminescence substrate (West Pico, Thermo Scientific). Acquisition was performed with a G-BOX imager (Ozyme). HEK 293T cells expressing Renilla luciferase were seeded in 48-well plates and cultured until 80% confluence. Cells were co-transfected with an AP1-responsive firefly luciferase construct (Qiagen, AP1 reporter (luc) kit, catalog no. CCS-011L) plus expression vector and starved overnight. Then cells were stimulated with DMEM and 1% FCS with or without WNT5A. Luciferase expression was measured using Dual-Luciferase® reporter assay system protocol (Promega) and a Centro LB 960 microplate luminometer (Berthold Technologies). Cells were seeded in 6-well plates precoated with rat tail collagen I and cultured on collagen I until confluence. Then cells were starved overnight and wounded using a pipette tip. Three wounds were made for each sample. Cells were stimulated with DMEM and 1% FCS with or without WNT5A. Cell migration was followed using video microscopy for 8 h, and analysis was performed with Metamorph software (Molecular Devices). PTK7 has been shown to heterodimerize with VEGFR1 (19.Lee H.K. Chauhan S.K. Kay E. Dana R. Flt-1 regulates vascular endothelial cell migration via a protein tyrosine kinase-7-dependent pathway.Blood. 2011; 117: 5762-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), an endothelial RTK. Here we hypothesized that ROR2, another active RTK implicated in PTK7-like developmental processes, may act as a candidate co-receptor for PTK7 in other cell types. ROR2 belongs to an RTK family comprising another homologous receptor, ROR1 (24.Minami Y. Oishi I. Endo M. Nishita M. Ror-family receptor tyrosine kinases in noncanonical Wnt signaling: their implications in developmental morphogenesis and human diseases.Dev. Dyn. 2010; 239: 1-15PubMed Google Scholar). To evaluate the interaction between PTK7 and ROR family members, co-immunoprecipitation between ectopically expressed ROR1, ROR2, and PTK7 was performed in HEK 293T cells. We found that PTK7 formed a complex with ROR2 but not with ROR1 (Fig. 1A). To determine the region of PTK7 involved in the binding to ROR2, we generated a series of PTK7 mutants lacking extracellular Ig-like or intracellular regions (Fig. 1B). In co-immunoprecipitation assays, we showed that deletion of the whole extracellular region, but not of the intracellular region, inhibited the interaction with ROR2. The entire extracellular region of PTK7 was apparently required because deleted forms (PTK7Δ1–3 and Δ4–7) could still co-immunoprecipitate with ROR2 (Fig. 1, C and D). Using a cell fractionation procedure, we showed that all PTK7 mutants were present in the membrane fractions (Fig. 1E). We confirmed the PTK7-ROR2 interaction at the endogenous level in MEFs expressing or not expressing Ptk7 (Fig. 1F). Together, these data identify ROR2 as a receptor able to associate with PTK7. ROR2 has been described as a cell surface receptor for non-canonical WNT ligands such as WNT5A (24.Minami Y. Oishi I. Endo M. Nishita M. Ror-family receptor tyrosine kinases in noncanonical Wnt signaling: their implications in developmental morphogenesis and human diseases.Dev. Dyn. 2010; 239: 1-15PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, ROR2 and WNT5A could be co-immunoprecipitated upon ectopic expression in HEK 293T cells (Fig. 2A). To investigate a potential interaction between PTK7 and WNT5A, PTK7 was co-expressed with HA-tagged WNT5A or WNT1 in HEK 293T cells, and lysates were prepared for co-immunoprecipitation. As shown in Fig. 2B, PTK7 efficiently interacted with WNT5A but not WNT1. The presence of the entire extracellular region of PTK7 was required for the interaction with WNT5A (Fig. 2C). Deletion of the Ig-like loops (Δ1–3) or (Δ4–7) did not abolish the binding, although a weaker interaction was found between WNT5A and PTK7Δ4–7 (Fig. 2C). To evaluate whether WNT5A binding to PTK7 was indirect and due to PTK7-ROR2 heterodimerization, we depleted ROR2 with a specific siRNA and repeated the PTK7-WNT5A co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2D). The absence of ROR2 did not impair the interaction between WNT5A and PTK7, and overexpression of PTK7 did not modify the amount of ROR2 co-immunoprecipitated with WNT5A (Fig. 2E). Moreover, WNT5A stimulation did not affect the PTK7-ROR2 interaction, suggesting that these receptors bind independently to WNT5A (Fig. 1F). Taken together, these results show that PTK7 can form a complex with ROR2 and WNT5A in mammalian cells through its extracellular region. Loops 4–7 in PTK7 are apparently required for optimal binding to WNT5A but not ROR2. To further analyze the contribution of PTK7 to WNT5A-induced signaling, we examined the phosphorylation of JNK, a downstream effector of the WNT5A/ROR2 pathway (29.Nomachi A. Nishita M. Inaba D. Enomoto M. Hamasaki M. Minami Y. Receptor tyrosine kinase Ror2 mediates Wnt5a-induced polarized cell migration by activating c-Jun N-terminal kinase via actin-binding protein filamin A.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 27973-27981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In HEK 293T cells, expression of ROR2 or PTK7 alone did not lead to JNK phosphorylation. However, stimulation of each receptor with WNT5A induced a comparable and robust phosphorylation of the p54 and p46 JNK isoforms (Fig. 3A). Phosphorylated JNK activates the c-JUN protein, which is known to form the activator protein 1 (AP-1) transcription factor. We used an AP-1-responsive firefly luciferase construct to monitor the transcriptional activity of AP-1 in HEK 293T cells expressing PTK7 or ROR2. Upon WNT5A stimulation, ROR2 and PTK7 similarly induced AP-1-dependent gene transcription that correlated to JNK phosphorylation. Co-expression of both receptors led to an additive effect on AP-1 reporter activation (Fig. 3B). From these data, we concluded that, like ROR2, PTK7 responds to WNT5A by inducing a JNK cascade in mammalian cells. Interestingly, in experiments using the truncated forms of PTK7, we found that deletion of loops 4–7 decreased JNK phosphorylation upon WNT5A stimulation (Fig. 3C). These data are in agreement with binding data showing weaker binding of WNT5A to the PTK7 Δ4–7 mutant (Fig. 2C). We next aimed to assess the role of the WNT5A-PTK7-JNK pathway at the functional level. We used primary MEFs because these cells express endogenous PTK7 (Fig. 1F) and have been used to characterize the WNT5A/ROR2/JNK cascade for its involvement in cell motility (30.Nishita M. Yoo S.K. Nomachi A. Kani S. Sougawa N. Ohta Y. Takada S. Kikuchi A. Minami Y. Filopodia formation mediated by receptor tyrosine kinase Ror2 is required for Wnt5a-induced cell migration.J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). We first looked at the level of JNK phosphorylation upon WNT5A stimulation in WT and PTK7-deficient (PTK7 KO) MEFs. We observed robust JNK phosphorylation after WNT5A treatment (Fig. 3D), which was impaired significantly (50% decrease) in the absence of PTK7. These data confirmed that PTK7 is implicated, in part, in WNT5A signal transduction in MEFs. We next used a wound healing assay to evaluate the contribution of the WNT5A-PTK7-JNK pathway to cell movements. Unstimulated wild-type MEFs closed 40% of the wound in 8 h, whereas addition of WNT5A led to an almost (90%) complete closure (Fig. 3E). In contrast, PTK7-deficient MEFs were not responsive to WNT5A and presented a similar closure with or without ligand. Importantly, we could rescue WNT5A-induced cell migration by re-expressing PTK7 in PTK7-deficient MEFs (PTK7 KO + PTK7 cDNA). To investigate the contribution of JNK activity in PTK7-induced cell movements, wild-type MEFs were treated with two different JNK inhibitors (CAS 129-56-6 and SP600125) or dimethyl sulfoxide and assayed in wound healing experiments as in Fig. 3E. WNT5A-induced cell motility of wild-type MEFs was abolished by JNK inhibition compared with the control condition (Fig. 3F). We concluded that PTK7 promotes cell movements in primary MEFs upon WNT5A stimulation by activating a JNK-dependent signaling pathway. These data are very comparable with those showing that WNT5A triggers a ROR2-JNK signaling pathway to regulate MEF cell migration (30.Nishita M. Yoo S.K. Nomachi A. Kani S. Sougawa N. Ohta Y. Takada S. Kikuchi A. Minami Y. Filopodia formation mediated by receptor tyrosine kinase Ror2 is required for Wnt5a-induced cell migration.J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Therefore, both receptors bind and respond to WNT5A. However, despite the expression of ROR2 in MEFs (data not shown), which allows a partial phosphorylation of JNK upon WNT5A stimulation (Fig. 3D), the presence of PTK7 is required for WNT5A activity in wound healing assays (Fig. 3E). During Xenopus development, the Wnt5a/Ror2 pathway regulates embryonic morphogenesis through induction of the key downstream effector papc (also known as pcdh8) in the involuting mesoderm (25.Schambony A. Wedlich D. Wnt-5A/Ror2 regulate expression of XPAPC through an alternative noncanonical signaling pathway.Dev. Cell. 2007; 12: 779-792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). On the basis of the above data, we hypothesized that Ptk7 could be involved in the activation of papc by the Wnt5A/Ror2 pathway. Consistent with this possibility, Ptk7 transcripts were detectable in the ectoderm and in the involuting mesoderm during gastrulation (Fig. 4A). To test our hypothesis, we first injected Ptk7 antisense morpholinos (Ptk7-MO) (9.Puppo F. Thomé V. Lhoumeau A.C. Cibois M. Gangar A. Lembo F. Belotti E. Marchetto S. Lécine P. Prébet T. Sebbagh M. Shin W.S. Lee S.T. Kodjabachian L. Borg J.P. Protein tyrosine kinase 7 has a conserved role in Wnt/β-catenin canonical signalling.EMBO Rep. 2011; 12: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This led to a dramatic decrease of papc expression on the injected side of gastrula embryos (Fig. 4B). To further test a possible functional interaction between Ptk7 and Ror2, we injected Ptk7-MO and Ror2-MO (25.Schambony A. Wedlich D. Wnt-5A/Ror2 regulate expression of XPAPC through an alternative noncanonical signaling pathway.Dev. Cell. 2007; 12: 779-792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) separately or together. When injected separately at high doses, both Ptk7-MO and Ror2-MO injection severely interfered with embryonic morphogenesis (Fig. 4C) and repressed papc expression, as measured by quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 4E). In contrast, development proceeded normally, and papc expression was maintained when suboptimal amounts of Ptk7-MO or Ror2-MO were injected (Fig. 4, D and E). However, co-injection of suboptimal amounts of both MO led to severe morphogenesis defects, and papc was repressed significantly (Fig. 4, D and E). Together, these data support the existence of a functional interaction between PTK7 and ROR2 in Xenopus that is required for correct morphogenesis. We next decided to test the potential conservation of PTK7 function between humans and Xenopus. We performed rescue assays of Ptk7 morphants with the human PTK7 constructs used as shown in Fig. 1B. Using the recovery of blastopore closure as a readout, we obtained significant rescue with full-length human PTK7 and with the Δ1–7 deletion construct but not with other mutant forms (Fig. 5, A and B). The rescue with full-length PTK7 indicates that the human and frog counterparts share the same biochemical activity and that functional conservation exists between species. The lack of rescue with Δ1–3, Δ4–7, and ΔKN deletion constructs implies that both extracellular and intracellular domains of PTK7 are important and that these constructs are likely unable to interact with the natural PTK7 partners. Of interest, the potent rescue with Δ1–7 human PTK7 suggests that perhaps it acts through the intracellular domain of PTK7 (PTK7-ICD) (15.Golubkov V.S. Strongin A.Y. Insights into ectodomain shedding and processing of protein-tyrosine pseudokinase 7 (PTK7).J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 42009-42018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 18.Na H.W. Shin W.S. Ludwig A. Lee S.T. The cytosolic domain of protein-tyrosine kinase 7 (PTK7), generated from sequential cleavage by a disintegrin and metalloprotease 17 (ADAM17) and γ-secretase, enhances cell proliferation and migration in colon cancer cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 25001-25009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In addition, papc expression was rescued in Ptk7 morphants by re-expressing full-length human PTK7 and the PTK7 Δ1–7 construct (Fig. 5C). Next we examined more directly whether Ptk7 was required for Wnt5a-induced papc expression (25.Schambony A. Wedlich D. Wnt-5A/Ror2 regulate expression of XPAPC through an alternative noncanonical signaling pathway.Dev. Cell. 2007; 12: 779-792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Injection of Wnt5a RNA in naïve ectoderm induced a massive induction of papc expression that was totally suppressed in the presence of Ptk7-MO (Fig. 6A). It has been shown that the PTK7 receptor is subjected to proteolytic cleavage in cancer cell lines and that the released PTK7-ICD is able to translocate into the nucleus (15.Golubkov V.S. Strongin A.Y. Insights into ectodomain shedding and processing of protein-tyrosine pseudokinase 7 (PTK7).J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 42009-42018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 18.Na H.W. Shin W.S. Ludwig A. Lee S.T. The cytosolic domain of protein-tyrosine kinase 7 (PTK7), generated from sequential cleavage by a disintegrin and metalloprotease 17 (ADAM17) and γ-secretase, enhances cell proliferation and migration in colon cancer cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 25001-25009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) We hypothesized that, in Xenopus cells, Wnt5A could trigger the cleavage and translocation of Ptk7-ICD. As expected, injection into naïve ectoderm of a construct encoding a C-terminal fusion of GFP with full-length Ptk7 revealed a strict localization at the cell membrane (Fig. 6, B and C). However, when this construct was expressed together with Wnt5a RNA, we could detect the GFP signal in the membrane, in the cytoplasm, and in the nucleus (Fig. 6C). This result was consistent with the release of Ptk7-ICD induced by Wnt5A but could also reflect changes in the trafficking of full-length Ptk7. Therefore, we evaluated the subcellular localization of a truncated construct encoding Ptk7-ICD fused to GFP at its C terminus. We found that, upon injection of this construct into naïve ectoderm, the GFP signal was also distributed between the plasma membrane, the cytoplasm, and the nucleus (Fig. 6D). Importantly, quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that Ptk7-ICD, in the absence of exogenous Wnt5a, was capable of strongly activating papc expression in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6E). Our data suggest that, beyond its interaction with Ror2, Ptk7 may be cleaved when bound to Wnt5a and may directly participate in transcriptional activation of downstream targets such as papc. Our report highlights novel findings regarding the role of PTK7 in WNT/PCP signaling. First, we provide compelling evidence of a physical interaction between PTK7 and ROR2, a WNT/PCP-related receptor. Binding is specific in the ROR family and occurs through the entire PTK7 extracellular domain (Fig. 1). Second, in contrast to a report published previously (11.Peradziryi H. Kaplan N.A. Podleschny M. Liu X. Wehner P. Borchers A. Tolwinski N.S. PTK7/Otk interacts with Wnts and inhibits canonical Wnt signalling.EMBO J. 2011; 30: 3729-3740Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), we find that WNT5A readily co-immunoprecipitates with PTK7 and, like ROR2, induces JNK phosphorylation and cell movements (FIGURE 1., FIGURE 3.). We cannot explain the lack of interaction between WNT5A and PTK7 reported by Peradziryi et al. (11.Peradziryi H. Kaplan N.A. Podleschny M. Liu X. Wehner P. Borchers A. Tolwinski N.S. PTK7/Otk interacts with Wnts and inhibits canonical Wnt signalling.EMBO J. 2011; 30: 3729-3740Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The recipients used for the co-immunoprecipitation experiments are, however, different between this study and ours. In the cited report, co-immunoprecipitations were performed in Xenopus egg extracts, whereas ours were done in HEK 293T cells. However, we controlled the functionality of our WNT5A construct by showing its interaction with ROR2, a well known interactor (Fig. 2A). In Peradziryi et al. (11.Peradziryi H. Kaplan N.A. Podleschny M. Liu X. Wehner P. Borchers A. Tolwinski N.S. PTK7/Otk interacts with Wnts and inhibits canonical Wnt signalling.EMBO J. 2011; 30: 3729-3740Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), the authors proposed that, by binding to canonical WNT3A or WNT8 ligands, PTK7 inhibited canonical WNT activity by sequestering these ligands. Another report has shown that WNT5A inhibited the canonical WNT pathway by promoting the degradation of β-catenin (31.Topol L. Jiang X. Choi H. Garrett-Beal L. Carolan P.J. Yang Y. Wnt-5a inhibits the canonical Wnt pathway by promoting GSK-3-independent β-catenin degradation.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 899-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Our findings suggest that PTK7 can directly trigger the non-canonical WNT signaling pathway through its binding to WNT5A. Binding could be direct or indirect through Frizzled receptors, as shown for WNT3a (11.Peradziryi H. Kaplan N.A. Podleschny M. Liu X. Wehner P. Borchers A. Tolwinski N.S. PTK7/Otk interacts with Wnts and inhibits canonical Wnt signalling.EMBO J. 2011; 30: 3729-3740Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and is partially dependent on loops 4–7 (Fig. 2C). Third, we evidence a functional interaction between Ptk7 and Ror2 in Xenopus and a dependence of Wnt5a to Ptk7 (Fig. 4). Fourth, using rescue assays in Xenopus, we determined that human and frog PTK7 have conserved functions (Fig. 5). However, compared with our assays in HEK 293T cells, the situation is more complicated in Xenopus because both extracellular and intracellular regions of PTK7 are required for the function of the receptor, in particular its ICD. Indeed, we provide evidence for a physiological function of Ptk7 ICD (Fig. 6), which, added to data obtained in cancer cells, suggest that cleavage and nuclearization are important processes for Ptk7 activity (15.Golubkov V.S. Strongin A.Y. Insights into ectodomain shedding and processing of protein-tyrosine pseudokinase 7 (PTK7).J. Biol.

Accordingly, aberrant proteolysis of Ptk7 has a profound effect on embryonic development (32.Golubkov V.S. Aleshin A.E. Strongin A.Y.

However, under the conditions of our assay, Ror2 appeared to be dispensable for the release and nuclear translocation of PTK7 ICD in Xenopus (data not shown).

https://openalex.org/W2415963104,"Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), an NAD+-dependent histone deacetylase, plays crucial roles in various biological processes including longevity, stress response, and cell survival. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is caused by dysfunction of ER homeostasis and exacerbates various diseases including diabetes, fatty liver, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Although several reports have shown that SIRT1 negatively regulates ER stress and ER stress-induced responses in vitro and in vivo, the effect of ER stress on SIRT1 is less explored. In this study, we showed that ER stress induced SIRT1 expression in vitro and in vivo. We further determined the molecular mechanisms of how ER stress induces SIRT1 expression. Surprisingly, the conventional ER stress-activated transcription factors XBP1, ATF4, and ATF6 seem to be dispensable for SIRT1 induction. Based on inhibitor screening experiments with SIRT1 promoter, we found that the PI3K-Akt-GSK3β signaling pathway is required for SIRT1 induction by ER stress. Moreover, we showed that pharmacological inhibition of SIRT1 by EX527 inhibited the ER stress-induced cellular death in vitro and severe hepatocellular injury in vivo, indicating a detrimental role of SIRT1 in ER stress-induced damage responses. Collectively, these data suggest that SIRT1 expression is up-regulated by ER stress and contributes to ER stress-induced cellular damage."
https://openalex.org/W1870572110,"Background Reduced muscle strength is an independent risk factor for falls and related to postural instability in individuals with Parkinson’s disease. The ability of resistance training to improve postural control still remains unclear. Objective To compare resistance training with balance training to improve postural control in people with Parkinson’s disease. Methods 40 patients with idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (Hoehn&Yahr: 2.5–3.0) were randomly assigned into resistance or balance training (2x/week for 7 weeks). Assessments were performed at baseline, 8- and 12-weeks follow-up: primary outcome: Fullerton Advanced Balance (FAB) scale; secondary outcomes: center of mass analysis during surface perturbations, Timed-up-and-go-test, Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale, Clinical Global Impression, gait analysis, maximal isometric leg strength, PDQ-39, Beck Depression Inventory. Clinical tests were videotaped and analysed by a second rater, blind to group allocation and assessment time. Results 32 participants (resistance training: n = 17, balance training: n = 15; 8 drop-outs) were analyzed at 8-weeks follow-up. No significant difference was found in the FAB scale when comparing the effects of the two training types (p = 0.14; effect size (Cohen’s d) = -0.59). Participants from the resistance training group, but not from the balance training group significantly improved on the FAB scale (resistance training: +2.4 points, Cohen’s d = -0.46; balance training: +0.3 points, Cohen’s d = -0.08). Within the resistance training group, improvements of the FAB scale were significantly correlated with improvements of rate of force development and stride time variability. No significant differences were found in the secondary outcome measures when comparing the training effects of both training types. Conclusions The difference between resistance and balance training to improve postural control in people with Parkinson’s disease was small and not significant with this sample size. There was weak evidence that freely coordinated resistance training might be more effective than balance training. Our results indicate a relationship between the enhancement of rate of force development and the improvement of postural control. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT02253563"

We observed an increase of CXCR5+PD-1highCD57-Tfh and germinal center (GC) CD57+ Tfh in HIV+ spleens. Both subsets showed a reduced mRNA expression of the transcription factor STAT-3, co-stimulatory, regulatory and signal transduction molecules as compared to HIV- spleens. Similarly, Foxp3 expressing follicular regulatory T (Tfr) cells were increased, suggesting sustained GC reactions in chronically HIV+ spleens. As a consequence, GC B cell populations were expanded, however, complete maturation into memory B cells was reduced in HIV+ spleens where we evidenced a compromised production of B cell-activating cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-10. Collectively our data indicate that, although Tfh proliferation and GC reactions seem to be ongoing in HIV-infected spleens, Tfh ""differentiation"" and expression of costimulatory molecules is skewed with a profound effect on B cell maturation."
https://openalex.org/W1870130010,"Glioblastoma is the most common and aggressive form of intrinsic brain tumor. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β represents a central mediator of the malignant phenotype of these tumors by promoting invasiveness and angiogenesis, maintaining tumor cell stemness and inducing profound immunosuppression. Integrins, which are highly expressed in glioma cells, interact with the TGF-β pathway. Furthermore, a link has been described between activity of the transcription factor aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and TGF-β expression. Here we demonstrate that integrin inhibition, using αv, β3 or β5 neutralizing antibodies, RNA interference-mediated integrin gene silencing or pharmacological inhibition by the cyclic RGD peptide EMD 121974 (cilengitide) or the non-peptidic molecule GLPG0187, inhibits AhR activity. These effects are independent of cell detachment or cell density. While AhR mRNA expression was not affected by integrin inhibition, AhR total and nuclear protein levels were reduced, suggesting that integrin inhibition-mediated regulation of AhR may occur at a post-transcriptional level. AhR-null astrocytes, AhR-null hepatocytes or glioblastoma cells with a transiently silenced AhR gene showed reduced sensitivity to integrin inhibition-mediated alterations in TGF-β signaling, indicating that AhR mediates integrin control of the TGF-β pathway. Accordingly, there was a significant correlation of αv integrin levels with nuclear AhR and pSmad2 levels as determined by immunohistochemistry in human glioblastoma in vivo. In summary, this study identifies a signaling network comprising integrins, AhR and TGF-β and validates integrin inhibition as a promising strategy not only to inhibit angiogenesis, but also to block AhR- and TGF-β-controlled features of malignancy in human glioblastoma."
https://openalex.org/W1870857092,"Carotenoid cleavage oxygenases (CCOs) are non-heme, Fe(II)-dependent enzymes that participate in biologically important metabolic pathways involving carotenoids and apocarotenoids, including retinoids, stilbenes, and related compounds. CCOs typically catalyze the cleavage of non-aromatic double bonds by dioxygen (O2) to form aldehyde or ketone products. Expressed only in vertebrates, the RPE65 sub-group of CCOs catalyzes a non-canonical reaction consisting of concerted ester cleavage and trans-cis isomerization of all-trans-retinyl esters. It remains unclear whether the former group of CCOs functions as mono- or di-oxygenases. Additionally, a potential role for O2 in catalysis by the RPE65 group of CCOs has not been evaluated to date. Here, we investigated the pattern of oxygen incorporation into apocarotenoid products of Synechocystis apocarotenoid oxygenase. Reactions performed in the presence of 18O-labeled water and 18O2 revealed an unambiguous dioxygenase pattern of O2 incorporation into the reaction products. Substitution of Ala for Thr at position 136 of apocarotenoid oxygenase, a site predicted to govern the mono- versus dioxygenase tendency of CCOs, greatly reduced enzymatic activity without altering the dioxygenase labeling pattern. Reevaluation of the oxygen-labeling pattern of the resveratrol-cleaving CCO, NOV2, previously reported to be a monooxygenase, using a purified enzyme sample revealed that it too is a dioxygenase. We also demonstrated that bovine RPE65 is not dependent on O2 for its cleavage/isomerase activity. In conjunction with prior research, the results of this study resolve key issues regarding the utilization of O2 by CCOs and indicate that dioxygenase activity is a feature common among double bond-cleaving CCOs.

Since their initial discovery in bacteria and plants, tremendous progress has been made in elucidating the biological substrates of these enzymes (1.Kloer D.P. Schulz G.E.

Most characterized CCOs catalyze the oxidative cleavage of carotenoid carbon-carbon double bonds to yield aldehyde and/or ketone-containing apocarotenoid products (Fig. 1). Such activity was possibly the earliest to evolve in this family because apocarotenoids, particularly retinal, mediate photoreception by the ancient type 1 opsin protein family, members of which carry out many important physiological processes in phototactic and phototrophic organisms (4.Ernst O.P. Lodowski D.T. Elstner M. Hegemann P. Brown L.S. Kandori H. Microbial and animal rhodopsins: structures, functions, and molecular mechanisms.Chem.

Another group of bacterial and fungal members has evolved to cleave carbon double bonds of stilbenes such as resveratrol and lignin-related phenylpropanoids (6.Kamoda S. Saburi Y.

The RPE65 class of CCOs, found only in vertebrates, underwent catalytic neofunctionalization during its split from a β-carotene oxygenase (BCO)-2-like ancestor to acquire the non-oxidative retinyl ester cleavage/isomerase activity central to the visual cycle that generates 11-cis-retinal required for visual pigment (type II opsin) formation (Fig. 1, A and B) (8.Poliakov E.

The spin-forbidden reaction of O2 with alkene substrates of CCOs is made kinetically favorable through its reductive activation by the non-heme iron(II) centers of these enzymes (10.Neidig M.L. Solomon E.I. Structure-function correlations in oxygen activating non-heme iron enzymes.Chem. Commun. 2005; 47 (2005): 5843-5863Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Of central importance to understanding the mechanism of O2 activation by CCOs and its reaction with substrates is knowledge of whether one or both of the oxygen atoms from O2 is/are incorporated into the reaction products. In the former case, the non-O2-derived oxygen atom found in the reaction is expected to originate from an active site-bound water molecule. A number of studies using isotopically labeled O2 and H2O were carried out to address this question for CCOs, but the issue still remains debatable (11.Leuenberger M.G. Engeloch-Jarret C. Woggon W.D.

Biochem. 2013; 77: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). A factor complicating the interpretation of such experiments is the exchange of oxygen incorporated into the nascent products with that of bulk water during the sample workup and analysis. This makes dioxygenases appear to be monooxygenases (16.Byrn M. Calvin M. Oxygen-18 exchange reactions of aldehydes and ketones.J. Am. Chem.

Engeloch-Jarret C. Woggon W.D. The reaction mechanism of the enzyme-catalyzed central cleavage of β-carotene to retinal.Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.

Intestinal absorption and metabolism of carotenoids: insights from cell culture.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 430: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). More recent studies of human BCO1 (12.dela Seña C. Riedl K.M. Narayanasamy S. Curley Jr., R.W. Schwartz S.J. Harrison E.H.

Chem. 2006; 281: 9845-9851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), in which solvent exchange was carefully monitored, demonstrated dioxygenase labeling patterns for these CCOs. By contrast, labeling experiments performed on resveratrol and isoeugenol-cleaving CCOs, NOV2 (13.Marasco E.K. Schmidt-Dannert C. Identification of bacterial carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase homologues that cleave the interphenyl α,β double bond of stilbene derivatives via a monooxygenase reaction.Chembiochem. 2008; 9: 1450-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and isoeugenol monooxygenase (15.Ryu J.Y. Seo J. Park S. Ahn J.H. Chong Y. Sadowsky M.J. Hur H.G. Characterization of an isoeugenol monooxygenase (Iem) from Pseudomonas nitroreducens Jin1 that transforms isoeugenol to vanillin.Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2013; 77: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), from the non-carotenogenic bacteria Novosphingobium aromaticivorans and Pseudomonas nitroreducens, respectively, suggested a monooxygenase pattern of oxygen incorporation for both enzymes. Thus, the labeling studies performed to date seem to indicate that perhaps both monooxygenase and dioxygenase catalytic mechanisms may exist within the CCO enzyme family (18.Mutti F.G. Alkene cleavage catalysed by heme and nonheme enzymes: reaction mechanisms and biocatalytic applications.Bioinorg. Chem. Appl. 2012; 2012: 626909Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), a possibility previously suggested by a theoretical study of the Synechocystis ACO catalytic mechanism (19.Borowski T. Blomberg M.R. Siegbahn P.E. Reaction mechanism of apocarotenoid oxygenase (ACO): a DFT study.Chemistry. 2008; 14: 2264-2276Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In contrast to oxidative carotenoid cleavage by CCOs, a basic consideration of the ester cleavage/isomerization chemistry catalyzed by RPE65 does not suggest an obvious role for O2 in the retinoid isomerization reaction (Fig. 1B). Additionally, substrate and water isotope labeling studies do not indicate direct incorporation of O2-derived oxygen into the 11-cis-retinol product of the isomerization reaction (20.Kiser P.D. Golczak M. Lodowski D.T. Chance M.R. Palczewski K. Crystal structure of native RPE65, the retinoid isomerase of the visual cycle.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

However, the close structural similarity of the RPE65 and carotenoid-cleaving CCO Fe(II) centers, together with the evolutionary relatedness of these proteins, raise the possibility that certain features of their catalytic modes could be shared, including a requirement for O2 (24.Sui X. Kiser P.D. Lintig Jv. Palczewski K. Structural basis of carotenoid cleavage: from bacteria to mammals.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2013; 539: 203-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Recently, a hypothetical role for O2 in RPE65-catalyzed retinoid isomerization that does not involve its permanent incorporation into the reaction products has been proposed (25.Harrison P.J. Bugg T.D. Enzymology of the carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases: reaction mechanisms, inhibition and biochemical roles.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2014; 544: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In this study, we carried out isotope labeling studies on highly purified and active preparations of Synechocystis ACO and Novosphingobium NOV2 with assay protocols that minimized solvent oxygen back-exchange. These experiments unambiguously showed that both enzymes, like human BCO1 and Arabidopsis CCD1, are dioxygenases. A T136A substitution in the ACO sequence that was predicted to open an occluded coordination site for solvent binding, thus potentially favoring monooxygenase chemistry, did not alter the dioxygenase-labeling pattern (19.Borowski T. Blomberg M.R. Siegbahn P.E. Reaction mechanism of apocarotenoid oxygenase (ACO): a DFT study.Chemistry. 2008; 14: 2264-2276Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Using ACO as an internal control, we demonstrated that O2 is not required for RPE65-mediated conversion of all-trans-retinyl esters into 11-cis-retinol, in agreement with a recently proposed mechanism of retinoid isomerization (26.Kiser P.D. Zhang J. Badiee M. Li Q. Shi W. Sui X. Golczak M. Tochtrop G.P. Palczewski K. Catalytic mechanism of a retinoid isomerase essential for vertebrate vision.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2015; 11: 409-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). These data provide compelling evidence for a common dioxygenase mechanism among all double bond-cleaving CCOs. The CCO amino acid sequences of interest were retrieved from the NCBI protein database. Atomic coordinates for CCOs of known structure, Synechocystis ACO, bovine RPE65, and Zea mays VP14 (PDB accession codes, 4OU9, 4RSC, and 3NPE, respectively) were obtained from the Protein Data Bank. A structure-based sequence alignment was first generated using the program MUSTANG (27.Konagurthu A.S. Whisstock J.C. Stuckey P.J. Lesk A.M. MUSTANG: a multiple structural alignment algorithm.Proteins. 2006; 64: 559-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). This structure-based alignment was then used as a profile for sequence-based alignment of the remaining proteins using MUSCLE (28.Edgar R.C. MUSCLE: multiple sequence alignment with high accuracy and high throughput.Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 1792-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (30229) Google Scholar). A standard sequence-based alignment of the proteins was also generated with MUSCLE to assess the influence of the alignment methodology on the inferred tree topology. Columns containing gaps were removed from the alignment. The CCO phylogeny was inferred based on the maximum likelihood optimality criterion as implemented in PhyML (29.Guindon S. Lethiec F. Duroux P. Gascuel O. PHYML Online–a web server for fast maximum likelihood-based phylogenetic inference.Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: W557-W559Crossref PubMed Scopus (1211) Google Scholar). The LG substitution matrix with an estimation of the γ-parameter (four categories) and invariant sites resulted in the highest log-likelihood tree as assessed by ProtTest (30.Darriba D. Taboada G.L. Doallo R. Posada D. ProtTest 3: fast selection of best-fit models of protein evolution.Bioinformatics. 2011; 27: 1164-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (1884) Google Scholar). Improvements to the starting neighbor-joining tree were carried out by both nearest neighbor interchange and surface pruning and regrafting rearrangements. Both tree topology and branch lengths were optimized. Tree robustness was assessed by analysis of 1000 bootstrap pseudo-replicates. The presented maximum likelihood tree had a log likelihood value of −14321.6 (Fig. 1A). An identical tree topology was obtained when the procedure was repeated with the pure sequence-based alignment. Synechocystis ACO was expressed and purified as described previously (31.Sui X. Kiser P.D. Che T. Carey P.R. Golczak M. Shi W. von Lintig J. Palczewski K.

The ACO T136A point mutant was generated with a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, Santa Clara, CA) and confirmed by DNA sequencing. T136A-ACO was expressed and purified identically to the wild-type protein. The coding sequence of NOV2 from N. aromaticivorans DSM 12444 (GI: 499765715) was synthesized and cloned into the pET3a expression vector (Novagen) without any fusion tags. The integrity of this expression plasmid was confirmed by sequencing. The plasmid was transformed into the T7 express BL21 Escherichia coli strain (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) for protein expression studies. One-liter cultures containing 100 μg of ampicillin/ml of LB media were grown at 37 °C to an A600 nm of 0.5–0.8 when the temperature was lowered to 28 °C and additional ampicillin (100 μg/ml) was added. Protein expression relied on leaky T7 promoter activity. After overnight growth (12–16 h), cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at −80 °C. NOV2 was purified in the same manner as ACO (31.Sui X. Kiser P.D. Che T. Carey P.R. Golczak M. Shi W. von Lintig J. Palczewski K.

Purified protein samples (≥95% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE analysis) were flash-frozen and stored at −80 °C or placed on ice for immediate use. ACO activity studies were conducted according to previously established methods (31.Sui X. Kiser P.D. Che T. Carey P.R. Golczak M. Shi W. von Lintig J. Palczewski K.

NOV2 steady-state kinetics were assessed by monitoring the reduction of resveratrol absorbance at 304 nm over time using a Flexstation 3 plate reader device (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Reactions were run at 28 °C in 200 μl of 10 mm BisTris-HCl, pH 7.0, containing 0.8 μg of purified NOV2 and resveratrol (Sigma, 99% purity) at eight concentrations ranging from 62.5 to 0.49 μm separated by 2-fold dilutions. Absorbance measurements were taken every 15 s for a total of 10 min. Initial reaction velocities were determined from the linear portions of the reaction profiles. Absorbance was related to absolute concentrations by simultaneous absorbance recordings of resveratrol standards. For NOV2 oxygen labeling studies, resveratrol was delivered in DMSO to a HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.0, buffer system containing purified NOV2, and the reaction was carried out at 28 °C with 500 rpm shaking in a Thermomixer (Eppendorf, Hauppauge, NY), as described in detail below. Following the incubation, products were directly extracted by ethyl acetate and analyzed by HPLC (see below). Product amounts were quantified by plotting peak areas of known quantities of standards. To determine the background oxygen exchange for ACO- and NOV2-catalyzed reaction products, the exchange reactions were performed in H218O. For ACO reaction products, the reaction mixture consisted of 192 μl of H218O (99% 18O atom, Sigma), 4 μl of 1 m HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.0, 1 μl of 10% (w/v) Triton X-100, and 3 μl of 1 μg/μl freshly purified ACO. Then either authentic all-trans-retinal (TRC, Toronto, Canada, > 95% purity) or HPLC-purified 8′-hydroxy-15′-apocarotenal generated in-house by a large scale ACO-catalyzed reaction were added to the reaction mixture. The reaction mixture then was incubated at 28 °C with 500 rpm shaking in a Thermomixer. Samples (20 μl) were removed from the mixture at 0, 1, 2, 5, 15, 20, and 30 min and placed into tubes containing 200 μl of hexane followed by vigorous shaking. Then the extracted mixtures were centrifuged in a bench top centrifuge at 15,000 rpm for 2 min. Organic phases were collected and analyzed by LC-MS (see below). Two additional experiments were conducted in the same manner but with 1% (w/v) BSA and/or 5% (v/v) glacial acetic acid to evaluate protein or pH-facilitated oxygen exchange. Background oxygen exchange for the NOV2 reaction products was determined in a similar manner. Briefly, the reaction mixture contained 150 μl of H218O (97% 18O atom, Sigma), 3 μl of 1 m HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.0, and 2.3 μl of freshly purified NOV2 at 4.4 μg/μl. Authentic 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde (4-HBA) or 3,5-dihydroxybenzaldehyde (3,5-DHBA) (Sigma, >95% purity for both compounds) dissolved in DMSO was added to the reaction mixture. Samples (20 μl) were removed from the mixture at 0, 2, 5, 10, and 15 min, placed into tubes containing 200 μl of ethyl acetate, dried under argon, and then redissolved in acetonitrile for MS analysis. As with the apocarotenoid product experiment, reactions containing 1% (w/v) BSA or 5% (v/v) glacial acetic acid were used as controls. For the labeling study in H218O, cleavage reactions were performed in the same manner as described above. Specifically, 3 μl of purified ACO at 1 μg/μl were added to a reaction mixture containing 192 μl of H218O (99% 18O atom, Sigma), 4 μl of 1 m HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.0, and 1 μl of 10% (w/v) Triton X-100. The cleavage reaction was initiated by adding 5 μl of 4 mm all-trans-8′-apocarotenol dissolved in ethanol. The reaction mixture was incubated in a Thermomixer at 28 °C with 500 rpm shaking for 5 min. Then the reaction was quenched with 200 μl of methanol, and 400 μl of diethyl ether/hexanes (4:1, v/v) was added to extract the cleavage products. For the NOV2-catalyzed reaction, 2 μl of 25 mm resveratrol in DMSO was added to a 200-μl reaction mixture consisting of 194 μl of H218O (97% 18O atom, Sigma), 4 μl of 1 m HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.0, and 2.3 μl of 4.4 μg/μl purified NOV2, and this reaction was allowed to proceed for 5 min at 28 °C with 500 rpm shaking. The 4-HBA and 3,5-DHBA products of the reaction were then extracted with 500 μl of ethyl acetate and immediately purified by normal phase HPLC as described below. Peaks corresponding to each cleavage product were collected in glass tubes, dried under argon, and dissolved in acetonitrile. Both NOV2 products were separated by HPLC (see below). ACO and NOV2 reaction products were further analyzed by mass spectrometry (MS) as outlined below. Sample deoxygenation was performed in 3-ml screw-capped glass vials with a gas-tight Teflon septum. A vial containing 1 ml of 20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.0, was flushed with ultrapure argon (Airgas, Cleveland, OH) with constant stirring. This deoxygenation treatment was carried out for different times to evaluate its efficiency. Oxygen supplementation was accomplished by flushing the argon-purged buffer solution with O2 (Airgas) for 3 min. To test ACO activity in argon-purged or oxygen-supplemented buffer, 5 μl of Triton X-100 (10% w/v) and 7.5 μl of freshly purified ACO at 2 μg/μl was injected into the treated reaction solutions with an airtight syringe (Hamilton, Reno, NV). The reaction was initiated by injecting 10 μl of 4 mm all-trans-8′-apocarotenol in ethanol and allowed to proceed for 3 min at room temperature with 800 rpm shaking. Then 1.5 ml of methanol was injected to quench the reaction followed by addition of 1 ml of diethyl ether/hexanes (4:1, v/v) to extract the products. The organic phase was collected for LC/MS analysis. For the cleavage reaction performed in an 18O2 atmosphere, 30 μg of purified ACO and 25 μl of substrate at 4 mm in ethanol were used, and 18O2 was introduced into the argon-purged reaction vial. The reaction was carried out for 10 min, followed by product extraction and LC-MS analysis. Both the deoxygenation and NOV2-catalyzed reaction in the presence of 18O2 were conducted in the same way as for ACO. Following a 15-min argon purge of the reaction solution, 5 μl of 20 mg/ml NOV2 and 10 μl of 25 mm resveratrol in DMSO were injected to initiate the reaction, which was carried out for 3 min under an 18O2 atmosphere. Reaction products were extracted with 500 μl of ethyl acetate and immediately dried by argon gas to remove the organic solvent and co-extracted water. The dried sample then was redissolved in ethyl acetate, purified by HPLC, and further analyzed by MS. HPLC-MS analyses of the ACO-catalyzed cleavage products of all-trans-8′-apocarotenol were performed according to previously established methods (31.Sui X. Kiser P.D. Che T. Carey P.R. Golczak M.

Products of NOV2-catalyzed resveratrol cleavage were extracted with ethyl acetate, dried under argon, redissolved in ethyl acetate, and injected onto a normal phase Zorbax Sil column (5 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm) (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). Separation of the reaction products was achieved with hexanes/ethyl acetate (3:2, v/v) as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.4 ml/min. Peaks eluted at ∼4.2 min (4-HBA) and ∼5.3 min (3,5-DHBA) were individually collected, dried under argon, and dissolved in acetonitrile. Purified products from the isotope labeling experiments were directly injected into the APCI source of an LXQ linear ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) with acetonitrile and 10 mm ammonium formate. MS data were analyzed with the Xcalibur 2.0.7 software package. Incorporation of 18O was quantified by comparing relative ion intensities within the isotopic distribution window. Bovine RPE microsomal membranes enriched in RPE65 were prepared as described previously (32.Golczak M. Kiser P.D. Lodowski D.T. Maeda A. Palczewski K.

The concentration of RPE65 in microsomal preparations was determined by quantitative densitometry on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Deoxygenation of RPE microsomes was carried out in the same manner as for ACO and NOV2. Briefly, 0.5 ml of RPE microsomes in a 3-ml screw-capped glass vial with a gas-tight Teflon septum was purged with ultrapure argon. Afterward, 2.5 μl of 20 μm all-trans-retinol in N,N-dimethylformamide was injected into the vial, and the reaction and p"

Hedgehog signaling is activated in osteoarthritis, where it promotes chondrocyte hypertrophy and cartilage matrix catabolism. Hedgehog signaling requires the primary cilium such that maintenance of this compartment is essential for pathway activity. Here we report that LiCl (50 mM) inhibits Hedgehog signaling in bovine articular chondrocytes such that the induction of GLI1 and PTCH1 expression is reduced by 71 and 55%, respectively. Pathway inhibition is associated with a 97% increase in primary cilia length from 2.09 ± 0.7 μm in untreated cells to 4.06 ± 0.9 μm in LiCl-treated cells. We show that cilia elongation disrupts trafficking within the axoneme with a 38% reduction in Arl13b ciliary localization at the distal region of the cilium, consistent with the role of Arl13b in modulating Hedgehog signaling. In addition, we demonstrate similar increases in cilia length in human chondrocytes in vitro and after administration of dietary lithium to Wistar rats in vivo. Our data provide new insights into the effects of LiCl on chondrocyte primary cilia and Hedgehog signaling and shows for the first time that pharmaceutical targeting of the primary cilium may have therapeutic benefits in the treatment of osteoarthritis.—Thompson, C.

https://openalex.org/W4247507498,"Secondary mutation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) resulting in drug resistance is one of the most critical issues in lung cancer therapy. Several drugs are being developed to overcome EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) resistance. Here, we report that pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) stabilized mutant EGFR protein by direct interaction and sustained cell survival signaling in lung cancer cells. PKM2 silencing resulted in markedly reduced mutant EGFR expression in TKI-sensitive or -resistant human lung cancer cells, and in inhibition of tumor growth in their xenografts, concomitant with downregulation of EGFR-related signaling. Mechanistically, PKM2 directly interacted with mutant EGFR and heat-shock protein 90 (HSP90), and thus stabilized EGFR by maintaining its binding with HSP90 and co-chaperones. Stabilization of EGFR relied on dimeric PKM2, and the protein half-life of mutant EGFR decreased when PKM2 was forced into its tetramer form. Clinical levels of PKM2 positively correlated with mutant EGFR expression and with patient outcome. These results reveal a previously undescribed non-glycolysis function of PKM2 in the cytoplasm, which contribute to EGFR-dependent tumorigenesis and provide a novel strategy to overcome drug resistance to EGFR TKIs."

Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of invasion and metastasis is the key to the development of new and effective therapeutic strategies for EHCC. In the present study we demonstrated that miR-221 promoted EHCC invasion and metastasis through targeting PTEN and formed a positive feedback loop with β-catenin/c-Jun signaling pathway. We found miR-221 was upregulated in EHCC specimens and CC cell lines. Moreover, miR-221 was found strongly associated with the metastasis and prognosis of EHCC patients. The expression of PTEN was downregulated in EHCC patients and CC cell lines, and was further demonstrated as one of the downstream targets of miR-221. In addition, our data indicated that β-catenin activated miR-221 through c-jun, while miR-221 enhanced β-catenin signaling induced-epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by targeting PTEN, hence forming a positive feedback loop in EHCC cell lines. In conclusion, our results suggested that miR-221 promotes EMT through targeting PTEN and forms a positive feedback loop with β-catenin/c-Jun signaling pathway in EHCC."
https://openalex.org/W2412777305,"Human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) amplification/overexpression (HER2+) frequently co-occurs with PI3K pathway activation in breast tumors. PI3K signaling is most often activated by PIK3CA mutation or PTEN loss, which frequently results in sensitivity to p110α or p110β inhibitors, respectively. To examine the p110 isoform dependence in HER2+, PTEN-deficient tumors, we generated genetic mouse models of breast tumors driven by concurrent Her2 activation and Pten loss coupled with deletion of p110α or p110β. Ablation of p110α, but not p110β, significantly impaired the development of Her2+/Pten-null tumors in mice. We further show that p110α primarily mediates oncogenic signaling in HER2+/PTEN-deficient human cancers while p110β conditionally mediates PI3K/AKT signaling only upon HER2 inhibition. Combined HER2 and p110α inhibition effectively reduced PI3K/AKT signaling and growth of cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. Addition of the p110β inhibitor to dual HER2 and p110α inhibition induced tumor regression in a xenograft model of HER2+/PTEN-deficient human cancers. Together, our data suggest that combined inhibition of HER2 and p110α/β may serve as a potent and durable therapeutic regimen for the treatment of HER2+, PTEN-deficient breast tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2341045533,"The activity of the thyroid gland is stimulated by food availability via leptin-induced thyrotropin-releasing hormone/thyroid-stimulating hormone expression. Here we show that food availability also stimulates thyroid hormone activation by accelerating the conversion of thyroxine to triiodothyronine via type 2 deiodinase in mouse skeletal muscle and in a cell model transitioning from 0.1 to 10% FBS. The underlying mechanism is transcriptional derepression of DIO2 through the mTORC2 pathway as defined in rictor knockdown cells. In cells kept in 0.1% FBS, there is DIO2 inhibition via FOXO1 binding to the DIO2 promoter. Repression of DIO2 by FOXO1 was confirmed using its specific inhibitor AS1842856 or adenoviral infection of constitutively active FOXO1. ChIP studies indicate that 4 h after 10% FBS-containing medium, FOXO1 binding markedly decreases, and the DIO2 promoter is activated. Studies in the insulin receptor FOXO1 KO mouse indicate that insulin is a key signaling molecule in this process. We conclude that FOXO1 represses DIO2 during fasting and that derepression occurs via nutritional activation of the PI3K-mTORC2-Akt pathway.

In mammals, body energy expenditure is gradually decreased with caloric restriction as well as prolonged starvation. This is an adaptive response driven by the hypothalamus that includes behavioral as well as metabolic modifications, such as increased sleep, diminished motor activity, and core temperature (1.Park H.K. Ahima R.S. Physiology of leptin: energy homeostasis, neuroendocrine function and metabolism.Metabolism. 2015; 64: 24-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). During fasting, the hormonal milieu is dominated by low levels of insulin and thyroid hormones, which has been proposed as an explanation for the slowdown in weight loss after a few days of caloric restriction (2.Burger A.G.

These observations indicate that the set point at which the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid activity is maintained is affected by nutrient availability, with the lowest (default) levels of activity seen during caloric restriction. Leptin is the key molecule signaling food intake and the availability of energy substrates, which defines the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid set point by stimulating secretion of thyrotropin-releasing hormone and thyroid-stimulating hormone and hence thyroidal activity (5.Boelen A.

In humans, the thyroid gland contributes with about 20% of the daily T3 production, and the residual 80% is contributed by two deiodinases that convert T4 to T3 outside the thyroid parenchyma (i.e. D1 and D2, with the latter playing the major role) (7.Gereben B.

However, it is less clear whether the extrathyroidal T3 production is reduced as well. Whereas hepatic D1 activity is reduced during caloric restriction in rodents (11.Balsam A. Ingbar S.H.

Therefore, control of the D2 pathway by caloric intake could potentially modulate thyroid hormone signaling by affecting intracellular T3 concentration as well as circulating T3 levels.

In the present study, we have examined how nutrient availability and insulin stimulate D2 activity in mice and cell models. We have found that insulin signals through PI3K-mTORC2-Akt to relieve FOXO1-mediated repression of DIO2, indicating that nutrient availability controls serum levels of thyroid hormones not only by modulating the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid set point but also by regulating extrathyroidal T3 production. Given that serum T3 is a major determinant of energy expenditure (29.Bianco A.C. Anderson G. Forrest D. Galton V.A. Gereben B. Kim B.W. Kopp P.A. Liao X.H. Obregon M.J. Peeters R.P. Refetoff S.

As indicated, cells were serum-starved for 48 h in 0.1% FBS medium prior to re-exposure to 10% FBS medium, insulin stimulation, or IGF-1 stimulation. After harvesting, tissues and MSTO-211H cells were resuspended in Dulbecco's PBS containing 1 mm EDTA (PE), 0.25 m sucrose, and 10 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) and sonicated, and cell lysates were analyzed for protein concentration via Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). D2 assays were performed as described previously in duplicate (27.Grozovsky R. Ribich S. Rosene M.L. Mulcahey M.A. Huang S.A. Patti M.E. Bianco A.C. Kim B.W.

RNA was extracted from MSTO-211H cells or animal tissue using the RNAqueous Micro Kit (Life Technologies Inc.) or RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen), respectively. RNA was quantified with a NanoDrop and reverse transcribed using High Capacity cDNA (Applied Biosystems) or the First Strand cDNA for RT-PCR (AMV) Kit (Roche Applied Science). Genes of interest were measured by qPCR (Bio-Rad iCycler iQ real-time PCR detection system) using the iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) or qPCR (Applied Biosystems Step One Plus Real-Time PCR System) using the SYBR Green FastMix ROX (Quanta Biosciences). Relative quantitation was using the standard curve method and the iCycler or Step One Plus software. Cells/tissues were lysed in 0.25 m sucrose PE containing 10 mm DTT. The lysates were diluted with 4× sample loading buffer (Invitrogen), and 5–25 μg of total protein were run on 4–12% NuPAGE BisTris gels (Life Technologies, Inc.). Samples were transferred to Immobilon-FL PVDF transfer membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA) and probed with antibodies as indicated at a 1:1000 dilution overnight. Fluorescent labeled secondary antibodies (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE) were used at 1:2500 for 1 h. All blots were imaged using the LI-COR Odyssey instrument per the manufacturer's instructions. The production of T3 from outer ring-labeled T4 in intact cells was analyzed by measuring 125I in the medium as described elsewhere (31.da-Silva W.S. Harney J.W. Kim B.W. Li J. Bianco S.D.

Rictor and raptor knockdown were established by transduction with GIPZ lentiviral shRNAmir vectors in MSTO-211H cells using GIPZ lentiviral shRNAmir for non-silencing control (NSC), human rictor (clone ID V2LHS_120392 and clone ID V3LHS_367492), or human raptor (clone ID V3LHS_636800) from Thermo Scientific (Lafayette, CO). For generation of stable knockdown cell lines, MSTO-211H cells were plated at 1.5 × 105 cells/well and transduced with lentiviral particles at a multiplicity of infection of ∼23 and ∼15 for rictor, respectively, and a multiplicity of infection of ∼13 for raptor and diluted in 1 ml of serum-free RPMI containing 8 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich). After 6 h, 1 ml of complete RPMI was added to each well (6-well plates). 72 h later, the transfection mixture was replaced with complete medium containing puromycin (1 μg/ml) to select for shRNA-expressing cells. Stable cell lines were generated after puromycin selection for 7 days. Adenoviral particles expressing WT and CA FOXO1 as described (32.Zhang W. Patil S. Chauhan B. Guo S. Powell D.R. Le J.

Cells were plated at 2.5 × 105 cells/well in 6-well dishes and transduced with adenoviral particles of concentration 2.0 × 1010 pfu/ml and 1.8 × 1010 pfu/ml, respectively, that were diluted in 1 ml of serum-free RPMI. Complete medium containing 10% FBS was added after 6 h, and the medium was changed again after 24 h. At 48 h, cells were refed or stimulated with insulin for the experimental procedure. All studies performed were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee of the University of Miami in compliance with National Institutes of Health Standards. Male, 3-month-old C57BL/6J mice purchased from Jackson Laboratory were housed at room temperature (22 °C) on a 12-h dark/light cycle. Mice were randomly divided into three groups (control, fasting, refeeding) and acclimatized for 5 days. Animals were fed ad libitum with a standard chow diet (3.5 kcal/g, 28.8% protein, 58.5% carbohydrate, 12.7% fat; 5010 LabDiet laboratory autoclavable rodent diet; PMI Nutrition, Richmond, IN) and water. When indicated, food was withdrawn at 21:00 h for the fasting and refeeding groups. After 36 h, fasted mice were sacrificed by asphyxiation in a CO2 chamber. Mice from the refeeding group were weighed, refed for 8 h, and sacrificed. Soleus muscle and cortex were rapidly dissected and frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until analysis. As indicated, freely feeding 11-week-old male insulin receptor (IR) floxed, liver-specific IR knock-out (LIRKO), and IR/FOXO1 double knock-out (LIRFKO) mice (33.O-Sullivan I. Zhang W. Wasserman D.H.

They were sacrificed by decapitation following brief sedation with isofluorane. Blood was collected by cardiac puncture, and plasma was stored at −80 °C until analysis. Insulin was measured using mouse insulin ELISA (Mercodia, AB). Serum T3 and T4 were measured as described previously (34.Ferrara A.M. Liao X.H. Gil-Ibáñez P. Marcinkowski T. Bernal J. Weiss R.E.

ChIP was performed using the EZ-ChIP chromatin immunoprecipitation kit (EMD Millipore) according to the manufacturer's guidelines. Primers for RT-qPCR (Applied Biosystems Step One Plus Real-Time PCR System) were designed for predicted FOXO1 binding sites in the DIO2 promoter region (forward, 5′-CTGTCTGGAGGAACTTGGATTT-3′; reverse, 5′-CCATGACTCCAACCCTTTGT-3′), and qPCR was performed using the SYBR Green FastMix ROX (Quanta Biosciences). All data were analyzed using PRISM software (GraphPad Software) and expressed as mean ± S.E. Student's t test was used to compare two groups. One-way analysis of variance was used to compare more than two groups. Significance was held at p < 0.05 (two-tailed). Fasting for 36 h caused a marked loss in body weight (Fig. 1A), a drop in serum insulin levels (Fig. 1B), and insulin signaling in skeletal muscle (Fig. 1C). This was associated with an ∼80% reduction in soleus Dio2 mRNA levels (Fig. 1D) and D2 activity (Fig. 1E). The decrease in D2 expression and activity was tissue-specific given that cerebral cortex Dio2 mRNA remained stable throughout the fasting period (Fig. 1F). This led to a ∼45% reduction in serum T3 levels (0.56 ± 0.11 versus 0.29 ± 0.06 ng/ml; n = 4; p < 0.01), whereas serum T4 remained largely unaffected (59 ± 12 versus 53 ± 10 ng/ml; n = 4; not significant). Refeeding for 8 h normalized body weight (Fig. 1A), increased serum insulin levels by about 100-fold (Fig. 1B), increased insulin signaling (Fig. 1C), elevated Dio2 mRNA (Fig. 1, G and H) and activity levels (Fig. 1I), normalized serum T3 (0.48 ± 0.09 ng/ml; n = 4), and did not affect serum T4 (54 ± 13 ng/ml; n = 4). Given that D2 activity is near background level in skeletal muscle cell lines (27.Grozovsky R. Ribich S. Rosene M.L. Mulcahey M.A. Huang S.A. Patti M.E. Bianco A.C. Kim B.W. Type 2 deiodinase expression is induced by peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor-γ agonists in skeletal myocytes.Endocrinology. 2009; 150: 1976-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), the role played by fasting and refeeding on DIO2 expression was next modeled using MSTO-211H cells, a cell line that endogenously expresses readily measurable D2 activity (30.Curcio C. Baqui M.M. Salvatore D. Rihn B.H. Mohr S. Harney J.W. Larsen P.R. Bianco A.C. The human type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase is a selenoprotein highly expressed in a mesothelioma cell line.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30183-30187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In this setting, keeping the cells for 48 h in 0.1% FBS caused a progressive reduction in DIO2 mRNA and activity to approximately half of the baseline values seen in cells cultured in 10% FBS (Fig. 2outf;F2, A and B). Notably, transition to 10% FBS resulted in a ∼3.5-fold increase in D2 activity (Fig. 2C) that followed a ∼2-fold increase in D2 mRNA levels (Fig. 2D); both subsided and returned to baseline levels by 24 h (Fig. 2, C and D). The increases in D2 activity (Fig. 2E) and typical serum-dependent downstream targets (Fig. 2F) were dependent on the amount of FBS contained in the fresh medium. D2 is known for having a post-translational regulation via ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, explaining its relatively short activity half-life of less than 1 h (35.Arrojo E Drigo R. Bianco A.C. Type 2 deiodinase at the crossroads of thyroid hormone action.Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2011; 43: 1432-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Thus, we tested whether the surge in D2 activity that follows refeeding could also involve the ubiquitin-proteasomal mechanism. D2 activity half-life was measured by exposing cells in 10% FBS to cyclohexamide, but at no time was there a significant effect on D2 activity half-life (Fig. 2, G–J). Serum/FBS contains a number of growth factors that could potentially induce D2 expression during refeeding, mostly acting via PI3K. Thus, we used insulin and observed a concentration-dependent increase in D2 activity of ∼50% after 8 h (Fig. 2K). We also observed a time-dependent increase in D2 activity following the stimulation of serum-starved MSTO-211H cells with 50 ng/ml IGF-1 (Fig. 2L). The acceleration in D2 activity increased thyroid hormone activation, given that T3 production was accelerated 4–5-fold after the addition of IGF-1 or insulin (Fig. 2M). Next, different strategies were used to dissect the molecular pathway that mediates the insulin/IGF-1 stimulation of DIO2 expression. First, we inhibited PI3K using LY294002, a well known reversible inhibitor of PI3K phosphorylation. Following the standard 48 h starvat"

Pregnant rats were treated with nicotine or saline at 2.0 mg/kg/d from gestational d 11 to 20. The female adult offspring with or without PNE were forced with a strenuous treadmill running for 6 wk to induce OA. Nicotine's effects on fetal articular chondrocytes were studied by exposing chondrocytes to nicotine for 10 d, and dihydro-β-erythroidine, a selective α4β2-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) inhibitor, was used to identify the change of nicotine's effect. For adult offspring, increased cartilage destruction and accelerated OA progression were observed in the PNE group with running; the expression of α1 chain of type II collagen (Col2A1), aggrecan, SRY-type high mobility group box 9 (Sox9), and IGF1 signaling molecules in the cartilage of PNE offspring were decreased. For fetuses, elevated serum corticosteroid and nicotine levels and suppressed IGF1 levels were observed; expression of Col2A1, aggrecan, Sox9, and IGF1 were reduced. The result of chondrocytes revealed that nicotine impeded the expression of Col2A1, aggrecan, and IGF1; blocking α4β2-nAChR rescued nicotine's suppression. In conclusion, PNE increases the susceptibility of adult offspring to OA; the potential mechanism involves IGF1 low-functional programming in articular cartilage caused directly by the action of nicotine on α4β2-nAChR."

In 2011, health center user fees for children under five were abolished in some districts. Objective To assess the effects of concurrent implementation of CCMm and user fees abolition on treatment-seeking practices for febrile children. Methods This is a natural experiment conducted in the districts of Kaya (CCMm plus user fees abolition) and Zorgho (CCMm only). Registry data from 2005 to 2014 on visits for malaria were collected from all eight rural health centers in the study area. Annual household surveys were administered during malaria transmission season in 2011 and 2012 in 1,035 randomly selected rural households. Interrupted time series models were fitted for registry data and Fine and Gray’s competing risks models for survey data. Results User fees abolition in Kaya significantly increased health center use by eligible children with malaria (incidence rate ratio for intercept change = 2.1, p <0.001). In 2011, in Kaya, likelihood of health center use for febrile children was three times higher and CHW use three times lower when caregivers knew services were free. Among the 421 children with fever in 2012, the delay before visiting a health center was significantly shorter in Kaya than in Zorgho (1.46 versus 1.79 days, p <0.05). Likelihood of visiting a health center on the first day of fever among households <2.5km or <5 km from a health center was two and three times higher in Kaya than in Zorgho, respectively (p <0.001). Conclusions User fees abolition reduced visit delay for febrile children living close to health centers. It also increased demand for and use of health center for children with malaria. Concurrently, demand for CHWs’ services diminished. User fees abolition and CCMm should be coordinated to maximize prompt access to treatment in rural areas."
https://openalex.org/W2207070375,"Signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) activation occurs frequently in human progenitor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). To identify gene alterations that cooperate with STAT5 activation to initiate leukemia, we crossed mice expressing a constitutively active form of STAT5 (Stat5b-CA) with mice in which a mutagenic Sleeping Beauty transposon (T2/Onc) was mobilized only in B cells. Stat5b-CA mice typically do not develop B-ALL (<2% penetrance); in contrast, 89% of Stat5b-CA mice in which the T2/Onc transposon had been mobilized died of B-ALL by 3 months of age. High-throughput sequencing approaches were used to identify genes frequently targeted by the T2/Onc transposon; these included Sos1 (74%), Kdm2a (35%), Jak1 (26%), Bmi1 (19%), Prdm14 or Ncoa2 (13%), Cdkn2a (10%), Ikzf1 (8%), Caap1 (6%) and Klf3 (6%). Collectively, these mutations target three major cellular processes: (i) the Janus kinase/STAT5 pathway (ii) progenitor B-cell differentiation and (iii) the CDKN2A tumor-suppressor pathway. Transposon insertions typically resulted in altered expression of these genes, as well as downstream pathways including STAT5, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) and p38. Importantly, expression of Sos1 and Kdm2a, and activation of p38, correlated with survival, further underscoring the role these genes and associated pathways have in B-ALL."

Expression and function of Prx II in HCC was determined using H-ras(G12V)-transformed HCC cells (H-ras(G12V)-HCC cells) and the tumor livers from H-ras(G12V)-transgenic (Tg) mice and HCC patients. Prx II was upregulated in H-ras(G12V)-HCC cells and H-ras(G12V)-Tg mouse tumor livers, the expression pattern of which highly similar to that of forkhead Box M1 (FoxM1). Moreover, either knockdown of FoxM1 or site-directed mutagenesis of FoxM1-binding site of Prx II promoter significantly reduced Prx II levels in H-ras(G12V)-HCC cells, indicating FoxM1 as a direct transcription factor of Prx II in HCC. Interestingly, the null mutation of Prx II markedly decreased the number and size of tumors in H-ras(G12V)-Tg livers. Consistent with this, knockdown of Prx II in H-ras(G12V)-HCC cells reduced the expression of cyclin D1, cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth and tumor formation in athymic nude mice, whereas overexpression of Prx II increased or aggravated the tumor phenotypes. Importantly, the expression of Prx II was correlated with that of FoxM1 in HCC patients. The activation of extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) pathway and the expression of FoxM1 and cyclin D1 were highly dependent on Prx II in H-ras(G12V)-HCC cells and H-ras(G12V)-Tg livers.

Mexican-Americans are genetically diverse, with a highly variable distribution of Native American, European, and African ancestries. Here, we evaluate the role of Native American ancestry on BMI and diabetes risk in a well-defined Mexican-American population. Participants were randomly selected among individuals residing in the Houston area who are enrolled in the Mexican-American Cohort study. Using a custom Illumina GoldenGate Panel, we genotyped DNA from 4,662 cohort participants for 87 Ancestry-Informative Markers. On average, the participants were of 50.2% Native American ancestry, 42.7% European ancestry and 7.1% African ancestry. Using multivariate linear regression, we found BMI and Native American ancestry were inversely correlated; individuals with <20% Native American ancestry were 2.5 times more likely to be severely obese compared to those with >80% Native American ancestry. Furthermore, we demonstrated an interaction between BMI and Native American ancestry in diabetes risk among women; Native American ancestry was a strong risk factor for diabetes only among overweight and obese women (OR = 1.190 for each 10% increase in Native American ancestry). This study offers new insight into the complex relationship between obesity, genetic ancestry, and their respective effects on diabetes risk.

https://openalex.org/W1823245867,"The Nek11 kinase is a potential mediator of the DNA damage response whose expression is upregulated in early stage colorectal cancers (CRCs). Here, using RNAi-mediated depletion, we examined the role of Nek11 in HCT116 WT and p53-null CRC cells exposed to ionizing radiation (IR) or the chemotherapeutic drug, irinotecan. We demonstrate that depletion of Nek11 prevents the G2/M arrest induced by these genotoxic agents and promotes p53-dependent apoptosis both in the presence and absence of DNA damage. Interestingly, Nek11 depletion also led to long-term loss of cell viability that was independent of p53 and exacerbated following IR exposure. CRC cells express four splice variants of Nek11 (L/S/C/D). These are predominantly cytoplasmic, but undergo nucleocytoplasmic shuttling mediated through adjacent nuclear import and export signals in the C-terminal non-catalytic domain. In HCT116 cells, Nek11S in particular has an important role in the DNA damage response. These data provide strong evidence that Nek11 contributes to the response of CRC cells to genotoxic agents and is essential for survival either with or without exposure to DNA damage."
https://openalex.org/W2166542227,"Ocular infection with Chlamydia trachomatis can cause trachoma, which is the leading cause of blindness due to infection worldwide. Despite the large-scale implementation of trachoma control programmes in the majority of countries where trachoma is endemic, there remains a need for a vaccine. Since C. trachomatis infects the conjunctival epithelium and stimulates an immune response in the associated lymphoid tissue, vaccine regimens that enhance local antibody responses could be advantageous. In experimental infections of non-human primates (NHPs), antibody specificity to C. trachomatis antigens was found to change over the course of ocular infection. The appearance of major outer membrane protein (MOMP) specific antibodies correlated with a reduction in ocular chlamydial burden, while subsequent generation of antibodies specific for PmpD and Pgp3 correlated with C. trachomatis eradication.We used a range of heterologous prime-boost vaccinations with DNA, Adenovirus, modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) and protein vaccines based on the major outer membrane protein (MOMP) as an antigen, and investigated the effect of vaccine route, antigen and regimen on the induction of anti-chlamydial antibodies detectable in the ocular lavage fluid of mice.Three intramuscular vaccinations with recombinant protein adjuvanted with MF59 induced significantly greater levels of anti-MOMP ocular antibodies than the other regimens tested. Intranasal delivery of vaccines induced less IgG antibody in the eye than intramuscular delivery. The inclusion of the antigens PmpD and Pgp3, singly or in combination, induced ocular antigen-specific IgG antibodies, although the anti-PmpD antibody response was consistently lower and attenuated by combination with other antigens.If translatable to NHPs and/or humans, this investigation of the murine C. trachomatis specific ocular antibody response following vaccination provides a potential mouse model for the rapid and high throughput evaluation of future trachoma vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W2102507104,"Objective Total tau (T-tau), phosphorylated tau (p-Tau) and Beta-Amyloid 1–42 (AB42) in Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) are useful biomarkers in neurodegenerative diseases. The aim of the study was to investigate the role of these and other CSF biomarkers (T-tau, p-Tau, AB42, S100B and NSE), during hypoxia-reoxygenation in a newborn pig model. Design Thirty newborn pigs were included in a study of moderate or severe hypoxia. The moderate hypoxia group (n = 12) was exposed to global hypoxia (8% O2) until Base excess (BE) reached -15 mmol/l. The pigs in the group exposed to severe hypoxia (n = 12) received 8% O2 until BE reached -20 mmol/l or mean Blood Pressure fell below 20 mm Hg, The control group (n = 6) was kept at room air. For all treatments, the CSF was collected at 9.5 hours after the intervention. Results The level of AB42 in CSF was significantly lower in the pigs exposed to severe hypoxia compared with the control group, 922(SD +/-445)pg/ml versus. 1290(SD +/-143) pg/ml (p<0.05), respectively. Further, a non-significant reduction of AB42 was observed in the group exposed to moderate hypoxia T-tau and p-Tau revealed no significant differences between the intervention groups and the control group, however a significantly higher level of S100B was seen in the CSF of pigs receiving hypoxia in comparison to the level in the control group. Further on, there was a moderate negative correlation between the levels of AB42 and S100B in CSF, as well as a moderate negative correlation between Lactate in blood at end of hypoxia and AB42 in CSF. Interpretation This is the first study to our knowledge that demonstrated a significant drop in AB42 in CSF after neonatal hypoxia. Whether or not this has an etiological basis for adult neurodegenerative disorders needs to be studied with additional experiments and epidemiological studies. AB42 and S100B are significantly changed in neonatal pigs subjected to hypoxia compared to controls and thus may be valuable biomarkers of perinatal asphyxia."

The recommended cold-based quarantine treatment (storage at 1.1°C for 14 days) was studied with two commercial avocado cultivars ‘Hass’ and ‘Ettinger’ for 2 years. Chilling injuries (CIs) are prevalent in the avocado fruit after cold-quarantine treatment. Hence, we examined the effect of integrating several treatments: modified atmosphere (MA; fruit covered with perforated polyethylene bags), methyl jasmonate (MJ; fruit dipped in 2.5 μM MJ for Hass or 10 μM MJ for Ettinger for 30 s), 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP; fruit treated with 300 ppb 1-MCP for 18 h) and low-temperature conditioning (LTC; a gradual decrease in temperature over 3 days) on CI reduction during cold quarantine. Avocado fruit stored at 1°C suffered from severe CI, lipid peroxidation, and increased expression of chilling-responsive genes of fruit peel. The combined therapeutic treatments alleviated CI in cold-quarantined fruit to the level in fruit stored at commercial temperature (5°C). A successful therapeutic treatment was developed to protect ‘Hass’ and ‘Ettinger’ avocado fruit during cold quarantine against fruit fly, while maintaining fruit quality. Subsequently, treated fruit stored at 1°C had a longer shelf life and less decay than the fruit stored at 5°C. This therapeutic treatment could potentially enable the export of avocado fruit to all quarantine-enforcing countries. Similar methods might be applicable to other types of fruit that require cold quarantine."

LOX immunoreactivity was scored in prostate tumor epithelium, tumor stroma and in the tumor-adjacent non-malignant prostate epithelium and stroma. LOX scores in tumor and non-malignant prostate tissues were then examined for possible associations with clinical characteristics and survival in a historical cohort of men that were diagnosed with prostate cancer at transurethral resection and followed by watchful waiting. Men with a low LOX score in the non-malignant prostate epithelium had significantly longer cancer specific survival than men with a high score. Furthermore, LOX score in non-malignant prostate epithelium remained prognostic in a multivariable analysis including Gleason score. LOX score in prostate tumor epithelium positively correlated to Gleason score and metastases but was not associated with cancer survival. LOX score in tumor and non-malignant prostate stroma appeared unrelated to these tumor characteristics. In radical prostatectomy specimens, LOX immune-staining corresponded to LOX in-situ hybridization and LOX mRNA levels were found to be similar between tumor and adjacent non-malignant areas, but significantly increased in bone metastases samples. LOX levels both in tumors and in the surrounding tumor-bearing organ are apparently related to prostate cancer aggressiveness."

Methods A total of 200 patients operated from July 2009 to June 2010 at Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University for pathologically confirmed HCC were retrospectively analyzed for clinical data, HBD DNA level and serum biochemical markers for liver fibrosis. The patients were followed up to observersation end point. Correlation of the monitored parameters with postoperative liver dysfunction and patient survival was statistically analyzed. Results Preoperative hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA level, serum prealbumin (PA) hyaluronic acid (HA), and laminin (LN) levels correlated with postoperative liver dysfunction. A predictive model was generated using these 4 parameters and validated in 89 HCC patients with sensitivity and specificity of 0.625 and 0.912, respectively. However, no correlation was identified between postoperative liver function and overall survival. Conclusion Liver fibrosis markers could be preoperatively used in predicting postoperative liver dysfunction in HCC patients."

The basal activity of Mec1 kinase is activated by cell cycle phase-specific activators. Three distinct activators stimulate Mec1 kinase using an intrinsically disordered domain of the protein. These are the Ddc1 subunit of the 9-1-1 checkpoint clamp (ortholog of human and Schizosaccharomyces pombe Rad9), the replication initiator Dpb11 (ortholog of human TopBP1 and S. pombe Cut5), and the multifunctional nuclease/helicase Dna2. Here, we use small peptides to determine the requirements for Mec1 activation. For Ddc1, we identify two essential aromatic amino acids in a hydrophobic environment that when fused together are proficient activators. Using this increased insight, we have been able to identify homologous motifs in S. pombe Rad9 that can activate Mec1. Furthermore, we show that a 9-amino acid Dna2-based peptide is sufficient for Mec1 activation. Studies with mutant activators suggest that binding of an activator to Mec1 is a two-step process, the first step involving the obligatory binding of essential aromatic amino acids to Mec1, followed by an enhancement in binding energy through interactions with neighboring sequences.

https://openalex.org/W2209166507,"Cellular senescence is an antiproliferative response with essential functions in tumor suppression and tissue homeostasis. Here we show that SIX1, a member of the SIX family of homeobox transcriptional factors, is a novel repressor of senescence. Our data show that SIX1 is specifically downregulated in fibroblasts upon oncogenic stress and other pro-senescence stimuli, as well as in senescent skin premalignant lesions. Silencing of SIX1 in human fibroblasts suffices to trigger senescence, which is mediated by p16INK4A and lacks a canonical senescence-associated secretory phenotype. Interestingly, SIX1-associated senescence is further characterized by the expression of a set of development and differentiation-related genes that significantly overlap with genes associated with SIX1 in organogenesis or human tumors, and show coincident regulation in oncogene-induced senescence. Mechanistically, we show that gene regulation by SIX1 during senescence is mediated, at least in part, by cooperation with Polycomb repressive complexes. In summary, our results identify SIX1, a key development regulator altered in human tumors, as a critical repressor of cellular senescence, providing a novel connection between senescence, differentiation and tumorigenesis."

However, regulation of the secretory pathway in Leishmania is not well characterized. Here, we report the cloning, expression, and characterization of the Rab1 homologue from Leishmania.

Moreover, Rab18, Rab30, and Rab43 are found to be important for maintaining Golgi structure (13Dejgaard S.Y. Murshid A. Erman A. Kizilay O. Verbich D. Lodge R. Dejgaard K. Ly-Hartig T.B. Pepperkok R.

In addition, transport of cargo from the Golgi to the cell surface is regulated by different Rabs. For example, Rab3 plays a role in release of neurotransmitter, Rab27 regulates the trafficking of lytic granules and melanosomes toward the plasma membrane, and Rab8 is involved in regulating the traffic from the trans-Golgi network to the plasma membrane (15Stenmark H.

Finally, internalized Hb is degraded in the lysosomes to generate intracellular heme, and this process of Hb endocytosis is essential for the parasite (27Guha R. Gupta D. Rastogi R. Vikram R.

In addition to HbR, Leishmania also secretes a large number of its effectors to the extracellular milieu (28McConville M.J. Mullin K.A. Ilgoutz S.C. Teasdale R.D.

Now there is convincing evidence that intracellular trafficking pathways, especially in trypanosomatid parasites, are regulated by various Rab GTPases (30Overath P. Engstler M. Endocytosis, membrane recycling and sorting of GPI-anchored proteins: Trypanosoma brucei as a model system.Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 735-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). It has been shown that TbRab1 and TbRab2 are localized in the ER-Golgi complex in Trypanosoma brucei, and RNAi-mediated knockdown of these proteins partially inhibits the transport of variant surface glycoprotein to the cell surface (31Dhir V.

Parasitol. 2004; 137: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), indicating that the Rab1-mediated secretory pathway is quite conserved in this group of parasites. Interestingly, it has been shown that export of newly synthesized proteins to the surface via secretory pathway is not actin-dependent, whereas trafficking in endocytic pathways is actin-dependent in Trypanosoma brucei (32Nolan D.P.

Although the secretory/endocytic pathway is not well characterized in Entamoeba histolytica, it has been shown that fibronectin receptor and Gal/GalNAc lectin trafficking to plasma membrane is brefeldin-A-dependent, whereas thiolproteinase secretion is brefeldin-A-independent in this parasite (33Manning-Cela R.

Further characterization reveals that overexpression of a GTP-locked mutant of EhRabA alters ER morphology and mislocalizes Gal/GalNAc lectin without affecting the localization of other cell surface proteins, indicating the specific role of EhRabA in early secretory pathway (34Welter B.H.

Here, we report the cloning, expression, and characterization of a Rab1 homologue from L. donovani. We have shown that overexpression of a dominant negative mutant of LdRab1 in Leishmania blocks the trafficking of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored 63-kDa surface glycoprotein (gp63) and secretory acid phosphatase (SAP), whereas trafficking of HbR to the cell surface is unaffected, indicating that gp63 and SAP follow a Rab1-dependent conventional secretory pathway, whereas HbR trafficking to cell surface is a Rab1-independent process. Unless otherwise stated, all reagents were obtained from Sigma. M199 medium and gentamicin were purchased from Gibco. Luria-Bertani (LB) broth and LB-agar were supplied by Difco.

Cells were routinely maintained on blood agar slants containing glucose, peptone, sodium chloride, beef heart extract, rabbit blood, and gentamycin, as described previously (11Tisdale E.J. Balch W.E. Rab2 is essential for the maturation of pre-Golgi intermediates.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29372-29379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). For experiments, cells were cultured in medium M199 (pH 7.4) supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 23 °C, and log phase cells were harvested in phosphate-buffered (10 mm, pH 7.2) saline (0.15 m). To clone the Rab1 homologue from Leishmania, a putative Rab1-like sequence was identified from the L. major genome database having substantial homology with T. brucei Rab1 by BLAST analysis. Accordingly, appropriate forward (5′-GTGGATCCATGACCGCTGAGTACGACTACC-3′) and reverse primers (5′-GTGAATTCTCAGCAGCTGTCTTCCTTC-3′) were designed against start and stop codons of putative L. major Rab1 sequence with BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites (underlined), respectively. The ORF of the putative Rab1 sequence was amplified from L. donovani cDNA using these primers by RT-PCR. Briefly, mRNA isolated from Leishmania promastigotes using an Oligotex mRNA kit (Qiagen) was used for cDNA synthesis using a Thermo Script RT-PCR kit (Gibco) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Subsequently, PCR was performed using the above primers in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences thermocycler for 30 cycles under the following conditions: denaturation for 1 min at 94 °C followed by annealing at 60 °C for 30 s and extension at 68 °C for 1 min. A 603-bp fragment amplified by PCR was cloned into pGEM-T-easy vector and sequenced by using m13 universal primers in an automated sequencer. Finally, the PCR product was cloned into BamHI/EcoRI sites of pGEX-4T-2 expression vector and transformed into the XL-1 Blue strain of Escherichia coli. To investigate the functions of Rab1 in Leishmania more precisely, two mutants (viz. LdRab1:Q67L and LdRab1:S22N) were generated by PCR-mediated site-directed mutagenesis as described previously (26Patel N. Singh S.B. Basu S.K. Mukhopadhyay A. Leishmania requires Rab7-mediated degradation of endocytosed hemoglobin for their growth.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 3980-3985Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). All mutants were generated using LdRab1:WT as a template. For the generation of LdRab1:Q67L mutant, a primer was designed having the Gln residue at position 67 changed to Leu (CAG codon was changed to CTG). In the first round of PCR, a megaprimer was amplified using the reverse mutant primer (5′-TGGCGGCCGGACCTCGCGAAG-3′) and the forward WT primer using LdRab1:WT as a template. PCR was carried out for 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 56 °C for 30 s, and extension at 68 °C for 1 min. The amplified megaprimer (220 bp) was gel-purified using a Qiagen gel purification kit. Subsequently, a second PCR was set up to amplify the full-length mutant product (603 bp) with the reverse WT primer and megaprimer as a forward primer. The PCR was set up as follows: five cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min and extension at 68 °C for 1 min to allow synthesis of the megaprimer strand. While at 68 °C, 25 pmol/μl of the Rab1 forward primer was added, and PCR was resumed for 25 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 70 °C for 30 s, and extension at 68 °C for 1 min. LdRab1:S22N was generated using the same procedure as described for LdRab1:Q67L except that the mutant primer (5′-CAGCCATTCTTGACGGACGAG-3′) used in the first PCR was designed such that the Ser residue at position 22 was changed to Asn (ACG codon was changed to AAT). The full-length PCR products (603 bp) were subsequently cloned into pGEM-T Easy and sequenced to confirm the respective mutations. Finally, mutants were subcloned into pGEX-4T-2 vector and transformed into E. coli. To purify recombinant proteins, E. coli (BL21 strain) was transformed with respective constructs. Cells were induced with 0.2 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 30 °C, and the respective GST fusion proteins were affinity-purified as per the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences) using glutathione-Sepharose 4B. Briefly, bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in PBS, pH 7.2, containing lysozyme (1 mg/ml) for 30 min at 4 °C. Subsequently, cell lysate were treated with DTT (1 mg/ml) in PBS, and unbroken cells were lysed by sonication at 4 °C. Finally, proteins were extracted with Triton X-100 (1%), and cell debris was separated by centrifugation at 18,500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Lysates were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. Following extensive washes with PBS, recombinant proteins were eluted from the beads in 50 mm Tris-HCl containing 30 mm glutathione, pH 9.0, and dialyzed against PBS. Purity of the proteins was checked by SDS-PAGE. GTP binding activity of purified LdRab1:WT and its mutants was detected by a GTP overlay assay (25Singh S.B. Tandon R. Krishnamurthy G. Vikram R. Sharma N. Basu S.K. Mukhopadhyay A. Rab5-mediated endosome-endosome fusion regulates hemoglobin endocytosis in Leishmania donovani.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5712-5722Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 μg of GST-LdRab1:WT or its mutants was blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane, and membrane was incubated with 1 μCi/ml [α-32P]GTP in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.3% Tween 20 for 3 h at 24 °C. Finally, the unbound radioactivity was removed by extensive washing and visualized by autoradiography. The GTPase activities of LdRab1:WT and its mutant GTP were determined as described previously (25Singh S.B. Tandon R. Krishnamurthy G. Vikram R. Sharma N. Basu S.K. Mukhopadhyay A. Rab5-mediated endosome-endosome fusion regulates hemoglobin endocytosis in Leishmania donovani.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5712-5722Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μg of immobilized protein on glutathione beads was incubated with buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm NaH2PO4, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol) for 20 min at 25 °C, and bound nucleotide was eluted with 1 m guanidine HCl. Immobilized nucleotide-free protein was then loaded with 2 pmol of [α-32P]GTP (800 Ci/mmol) in 20 μl of buffer A for 10 min at 0 °C. Subsequently, beads were washed and incubated for 1 h at 23 °C to allow the hydrolysis of bound GTP. Subsequently, the beads were washed, incubated in 8 μl of buffer B (0.2% SDS, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm GDP, 10 mm GTP, pH 7.5), and heated at 70 °C for 2 min to elute the nucleotide from the protein. An aliquot was analyzed using thin-layer chromatography and visualized by autoradiography. To generate antibody against LdRab1, immobilized GST-LdRab1 on beads was incubated with 10 units of thrombin (Pharmacia Corp.) in cleavage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl and 2.5 mm CaCl2) for 3 h at room temperature. Beads were removed by centrifugation, and the purity of the LdRab1 was checked by SDS-PAGE. Mice were immunized with LdRab1 to raise polyclonal antibodies by a standard method. The specificity of the antibody was determined by Western blot analysis using purified LdRab1, LdRab5, and LdRab7. To overexpress LdRab1 and its mutants in Leishmania as a GFP fusion protein having GFP tag in the N terminus, respective clones were subcloned into the NotI/BamHI sites of the pXG-GFP2+ vector (38Ha D.S.

Subsequently, Leishmania promastigotes were transfected with LdRab1:WT or its mutant constructs using the standard electroporation protocol (26Patel N. Singh S.B. Basu S.K. Mukhopadhyay A. Leishmania requires Rab7-mediated degradation of endocytosed hemoglobin for their growth.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 3980-3985Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown to the late log phase (1 × 107 cells/ml) at 23 °C in M199 medium supplemented with 10% FCS. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended at a density of 2 × 108 cells/ml in cytomix buffer (120 mm KCl, 0.15 mm CaCl2, 10 mm K2HPO4, 25 mm HEPES, 2 mm EDTA, and 5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.6). Cells (0.5 ml) were transferred to a precooled electroporation cuvette, and the appropriate plasmid DNA (40 μg) was added. Electroporation was carried out in a GenePulser (Bio-Rad) at 25-microfarad capacitance and 1500 V to facilitate DNA uptake by cells. Cells were then incubated on ice for 10 min and transferred into antibiotic-free M199 medium for 24 h at 23 °C. Subsequently, positive clones were selected in the presence of G418 antibiotic (30 μg/ml). Overexpression of respective protein was confirmed by Western blotting using anti-GFP and anti-Rab1 antibodies and confocal microscopy. To determine the localization of endogenous Rab1 in Leishmania, cells were harvested, washed, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Subsequently, cells were permeabilized with 0.4% saponin for 20 min and blocked with 10% FCS in PBS for 30 min. Finally, cells were probed with anti-LdRab1 antibody (1:200) in PBS containing 0.1% saponin and 10% FCS for 1 h at 23 °C. Cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated with Alexa Fluor 594-labeled goat anti-mouse secondary antibody in the same buffer for 1 h at 23 °C. Cells were washed and viewed in an LSM 510 Meta confocal microscope. To identify the LdRab1-positive compartment, GFP-LdRab1:WT-expressing Leishmania were labeled for different compartment-specific markers. The early endosomes were labeled with anti-LdRab5 antibody and subsequently probed with goat anti-mouse secondary antibody labeled with Alexa Fluor 594. Similarly, a 5-min internalization of Alexa Fluor 594-labeled hemoglobin (Alexa594-Hb) was used to mark the early endocytic compartment. The lysosome-like compartments in Leishmania were labeled with 100 nm LysoTracker Red DND-99. Golgi complex was visualized by overexpressing LPG2-HA in Leishmania followed by immunostaining with Alexa546-labeled rabbit anti-HA antibody (1:500). The nucleus and kinetoplast of Leishmania were visualized by staining with Hoechst. Leishmania promastigotes secrete an acid phosphatase (SAP) into the culture medium (39Ilg T. Stierhof Y.D. Etges R. Adrian M. Harbecke D. Overath P. Secreted acid phosphatase of Leishmania mexicana: a filamentous phosphoglycoprotein polymer.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1991; 88: 8774-8778Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Therefore, to functionally characterize the role of LdRab1 in the secretory pathway of Leishmania, we determined the release of SAP in the spent medium by L. donovani promastigotes overexpressing LdRab1:WT or its mutant proteins. The enzymatic activity of SAP released in the spent medium was measured using the method described earlier (40Bakalara N. Seyfang A. Baltz T. Davis C. Trypanosoma brucei and Trypanosoma cruzi: life cycle-regulated protein tyrosine phosphatase activity.Exp. Parasitol. 1995; 81: 302-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 × 106 cells of each cell type were inoculated in 1 ml of sterile M199 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum in a 24-well plate. Cells were incubated for different periods of time, after which cells were separated, and both medium and cell lysates were assayed for the enzyme activity by a standard assay. To measure the amount of SAP present in the culture supernatant, culture supernatant (138 μl) was incubated with 62 μl of 50 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate as substrate in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.0, containing 0.1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol for 30 min at 37 °C. The enzyme released p-nitrophenol from p-nitrophenyl phosphate, which was converted to p-nitrophenolate by the addition of 0.25 m NaOH. The absorbance of p-nitrophenolate was measured at 410 nm. The amount of p-nitrophenolate ion released was calculated from a millimolar extinction coefficient of 17.8. Similarly, SAP activity was measured from cell lysates. Results were expressed as μm p-nitrophenol released in the spent medium/cell lysate by respective Leishmania. Release of g"

The present study aims to investigate the activation of NF-κB and to identify the effect of NF-κB inhibition on the newborn rat kernicterus model. The NF-κB essential modifier-binding domain peptide (NBD), coupled with the HIV trans-activator of transcription peptide (TAT) was used to inhibit NF-κB. NF-κB was significantly activated in the cerebrum at 1 and 3 h (p < 0.05) after the model was established, as measured by EMSA. NF-κB activation was inhibited by intraperitoneal administration of TAT-NBD. The general conditions of the TAT-NBD-treated rats were improved; meanwhile, these rats performed much better on the neurological evaluation, the rotarod test, and the Morris water maze test (p < 0.05) than the vehicle-treated rats at 28 days. Furthermore, the morphology of the nerve cells was better preserved in the TAT-NBD group, and these cells displayed less neurodegeneration and astrocytosis. Simultaneously, apoptosis in the brain was attenuated, and the levels of the TNF-α and IL-1β proteins were decreased (p < 0.01). These results suggested that NF-κB was activated, and inhibition of NF-κB activation by TAT-NBD not only attenuated the acute neurotoxicity, apoptosis, and inflammation, but also improved the long term neurobehavioral impairments in the kernicterus model rats in vivo.

However, neonates with severe unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia may develop kernicterus, particularly those who are premature or have suffered sepsis, hypoxia, etc. Although the incidence rate of kernicterus has been dramatically reduced due to advancements in perinatal medicine, it still occurs throughout the world, particularly in developing countries (1Watchko J.F. Tiribelli C. Bilirubin-induced neurologic damage: mechanisms and management approaches.N. Engl. J. Med. 2013; 369: 2021-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 2Olusanya B.O. Ogunlesi T.A.

Kernicterus is considered a chronic sequela of acute bilirubin encephalopathy, which may lead to death or lifelong neurological sequelae, such as mental retardation, a developmental motor delay, and epilepsy (3American Academy of Pediatrics Subcommittee on Hyperbilirubinemia Management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation.Pediatrics. 2004; 114: 297-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (2017) Google Scholar, 4Ostrow J.D.

Unfortunately, although the level of unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) 3The abbreviations used are:UCBunconjugated bilirubinNF-κBnuclear factor κBNBDNF-κB essential modifier-binding domain peptideTATHIV trans-activator of transcription peptideTAT-NBDNBD coupled to the protein transduction sequence of TATCA1–CA3cornu ammonis sections 1–3NFneurofilamentsGFAPglial fibrillary acidic proteinANOVAanalysis of variance. in the serum can be rapidly reduced by phototherapy and/or exchange transfusion, the UCB that has already entered the nervous system cannot currently be replaced, and the irreversible neurologic damage cannot be prevented. Meanwhile, the limited availability of exchange transfusion and its severe complications remind us that it is critical to explore other effective strategies (2Olusanya B.O. Ogunlesi T.A. Slusher T.M.

The current studies suggest that UCB-induced oxidative stress, intracellular calcium overload, immunostimulation, and overactivated NMDA receptor might be involved in the pathogenesis of bilirubin encephalopathy. However, the effects of some specific interventions, such as the NMDA channel antagonist MK-801, are controversial, and the underlying mechanisms of bilirubin neurotoxicity remain unclear (5Brites D. Brito M.A. Stevenson D.K. Maisels M.J. Watchko J.F. Care of the Jaundiced Neonate. McGraw-Hill, New York2012: 115-143Google Scholar). Thus, further investigations are required. Nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of numerous genes involved in cell survival, apoptosis, and inflammation. In the resting state, the inactivated NF-κB is retained in the cytoplasm by an inhibitory subunit called IκB. The phosphorylation of IκB by Iκ-kinase, containing Iκ-kinase α and β, and the regulatory protein NEMO (NF-κB essential modifier) is a key step in NF-κB activation in response to various stimuli. Then the activated, free NF-κB translocates into the nucleus and regulates target gene expression (6Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Signaling to NF-κB.Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2195-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (3355) Google Scholar). It is confirmed that NF-κB plays a critical role in the development and function of the nervous system and in the pathological process of many nervous system diseases, such as ischemic stroke, brain trauma, and neurodegenerative disease (7Mincheva-Tasheva S. Soler R.M. NF-κB signaling pathways: role in nervous system physiology and pathology.Neuroscientist. 2013; 19: 175-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 8Mattson M.P. Camandola S. NF-κB in neuronal plasticity and neurodegenerative disorders.J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). Recently, several studies have demonstrated that UCB activates NF-κB in vitro, and inhibitors that block this activation exhibit an important influence on UCB-induced cellular inviability and cytokine secretion (9Falcão A.S. Fernandes A. Brito M.A. Silva R.F. Brites D.

Features of bilirubin-induced reactive microglia: from phagocytosis to inflammation.Neurobiol. Dis. 2010; 40: 663-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, there have been no in vivo studies conducted to identify the role of NF-κB in kernicterus, given that it has both protective and damaging roles in response to nervous system damage (7Mincheva-Tasheva S. Soler R.M. NF-κB signaling pathways: role in nervous system physiology and pathology.Neuroscientist. 2013; 19: 175-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). It is unclear whether the inhibition of NF-κB activation results in protection or damage in rat models of kernicterus. In previous studies, we have successfully established a rat kernicterus model that is stable and suitable for exploring bilirubin-mediated neurotoxicity in vivo (12Song S. Hu Y. Gu X. Si F. Hua Z. A novel newborn rat kernicterus model created by injecting a bilirubin solution into the cisterna magna.PLoS One. 2014; 9: e96171Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In this study, we used the NEMO binding domain peptide (NBD), a specific inhibitor of the IKK complex that does not affect basal NF-κB activity (13May M.J. D'Acquisto F. Madge L.A. Glöckner J. Pober J.S. Ghosh S. Selective inhibition of NF-κB activation by a peptide that blocks the interaction of NEMO with the IκB kinase complex.Science. 2000; 289: 1550-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar), coupled to the HIV trans-activator of transcription peptide (TAT), to facilitate the penetration of TAT-NBD though the blood-brain barrier and allow it to enter the cells (14Denicourt C. Dowdy S.F. Protein transduction technology offers novel therapeutic approach for brain ischemia.Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2003; 24: 216-218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This study aimed to investigate whether NF-κB activation was involved in the pathogenesis of kernicterus in vivo. Furthermore, the effects of TAT-NBD in the kernicterus rats were observed, including the morphologic changes of the nerve cells, cerebral apoptosis, cytokine production, general conditions, long term motor abilities, sensation function, and learning and memory. All animal procedures were approved by the Ethics Committee of Chongqing Medical University (Permit SYXK2007-0016). All experimental Sprague-Dawley rats (SPF grade) were obtained from the Animal Experiment Center of Chongqing Medical University. The animal studies were conducted in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. Efforts were made to minimize animal suffering and to reduce the number of animals used. All rats were housed on a 12-h/12-h light/dark cycle with a moderate temperature (23 ± 2 °C). The rat kernicterus model was established as described previously (12Song S. Hu Y. Gu X. Si F. Hua Z. A novel newborn rat kernicterus model created by injecting a bilirubin solution into the cisterna magna.PLoS One. 2014; 9: e96171Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Briefly, bilirubin (Sigma-Aldrich) was solubilized in a 0.5 m NaOH solution (100 mg/ml) and diluted in double-distilled H2O (10 mg/ml), and the pH was adjusted to 8.5 with HCl (0.5 m). At postnatal day 5, the Sprague-Dawley rat pups (10–15 g) were anesthetized with diethyl ether, and then ∼10–15 μl of the cerebrospinal fluid was released from the cisterna magna using a microsyringe (measuring range: 25 μl) to prevent intracranial hypertension. Finally, the bilirubin solution or double-distilled H2O (pH 8.5) was then injected into the cisterna magna at 10 μg/g (body weight). To explore the activation of NF-κB and the effect of TAT-NBD in the rat kernicterus model, the rat pups were divided into four groups (n ≥20 in each group): control group, vehicle group, TAT-NBD group, and TAT-NBDmut group. The TAT-NBD (YGRKKRRQRRR-TALDWSWLQTE) and TAT-NBDmut (YGRKKRRQRRR-TALDASALQTE) peptides (Science Peptide, Shanghai, China) were each dissolved in DMSO (40 mg/ml), diluted in PBS to a concentration of 1 mg/ml, and administered intraperitoneally at 10 μl/g (body weight) at 0 and 2 h after the model was established. The controls and vehicles were intraperitoneally administered equal volumes of DMSO and PBS. The clinical manifestation scores were assessed every 2 h a total of 3 times after the model was established by a double-blind method. As described previously (12Song S. Hu Y. Gu X. Si F. Hua Z. A novel newborn rat kernicterus model created by injecting a bilirubin solution into the cisterna magna.PLoS One. 2014; 9: e96171Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), clenched fists, opisthotonus, latericumbent positioning, and rolling were included in the clinical manifestation scores. One point was recorded if the rat showed any of these manifestations. The body weights were recorded daily for 3 consecutive days after the model was established. The number of rats that died after the model was established to postnatal day 28 was recorded to calculate the mortality. Based on a preliminary study (data not shown), four randomly selected rat pups in each group were sacrificed 24 h after the model was established, and the brain was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. Coronal paraffin sections (5 mm) were cut from the bregma at the optic chiasm through the dorsal and ventral hippocampus to reach the hippocampal formation, and three consecutive sections that contained hippocampus (cornu ammonis 1 (CA1), CA2, and CA3) and dentate gyrus were cut. Hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining (Roche Applied Science) were performed. The morphological changes in the hippocampus and the cerebral cortex were observed by light microscopy (Nikon, Japan). The total number of cells and the number of TUNEL-positive cells in the pyramidal neuron layers of the CA1, CA2, CA3, and dentate gyrus regions of the hippocampus or in the cerebral cortex were counted in eight randomly selected high magnification fields (×400) per section in a blinded fashion. The brain tissues fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (described above) were then stored in a 30% sucrose, PBS (pH 7.4) solution for 48 h, sectioned (40 μm) coronally for a 1:6 section series on a freezing microtome, and stored in 0.1% sodium azide in PBS at 4 °C until further use (15Panossian L. Fenik P. Zhu Y. Zhan G. McBurney M.W. Veasey S. SIRT1 regulation of wakefulness and senescence-like phenotype in wake neurons.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 4025-4036Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The brain sections were washed with PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 (Bio-Rad) (PBST; 3 × 10 min) and then blocked with 5% nonfat milk diluted in PBST (room temperature, 1 h). After washing with PBST (3 × 10 min), the brain sections were incubated with the following primary antibodies: neurofilaments (NF) for neuron (1:50) or glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) for astrocytes (1:100; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) overnight at 4 °C. After washing with PBST (3 × 10 min), the brain sections were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with an Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. After washing, the sections were co-stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for 15 min to stain the nuclei and then mounted on slides. The slides were imaged using a fluorescent microscope (Nikon, Japan). For image acquisition, the exposure time, detector gain, and amplifier offset were standardized across the compared sections. The percentage of the areas occupied by NF and GFAP were measured by ImageJ. At least seven random and separate microscopic fields (×200) of the hippocampus or the cerebral cortex were selected from each section, and the results were obtained from the averaged values (15Panossian L.

The extent of the neurological deficit was performed on 28-day-old rats by two blinded observers using the neurological evaluation system described by Garcia et al. (29Garcia J.H. Wagner S. Liu K.F. Hu X.J. Neurological deficit and extent of neuronal necrosis attributable to middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats: statistical validation.Stroke. 1995; 26 (discussion 635): 627-634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This neurological evaluation system consisted of the following tests: spontaneous activity, symmetry in the movement of the four limbs, forepaw outstretching, climbing, body proprioception, and response to vibrissae touch. The minimum neurological score is 3 (severe neurological function deficit), and the maximum is 18 (normal). The lower the score, the more severe the neurological function deficit. The rotarod test was performed to assess the rats' balance and motor coordination at the age of 28 days. The experimental rats were placed onto a horizontal rotating rod with the rotation speed increasing from 10 to 80 rpm over 3 min. A single test lasted from the time the rat was able to stay on the rotating rod until it fell off or until 3 min had elapsed. The time at which the rat fell off the rotating rod was recorded. Each rat was tested in four trials. The average time spent on the rotating rod was calculated. An open field test was conducted to evaluate the locomotor activity of 28-day-old rats by a blinded observer. In brief, the open field apparatus consists of a square arena (60 × 60 × 20 cm), with a digital camera mounted above the open field arena. The video and date were recorded using the ANY-maze software. The animals were allowed to acclimate to the testing room for 30 min before testing. A single rat was placed in the center of the arena and observed for 30 min. The arena was thoroughly cleaned with 75% alcohol after every session. The distance traveled in 30 min was measured to reflect the animals' locomotor activity (17Kim Y.R. Kim H.N. Pak M.E. Ahn S.M. Hong K.H. Shin H.K. Choi B.T.

The Morris water maze was performed as described previously (12Song S. Hu Y. Gu X. Si F. Hua Z. A novel newborn rat kernicterus model created by injecting a bilirubin solution into the cisterna magna.PLoS One. 2014; 9: e96171Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) to evaluate the rats' learning and memory at the age of 28 days. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was performed to investigate NF-κB activation using a nonradioactive infrared NF-κB EMSA kit (Viagen Biotech, Inc., Wuxi, China). The nuclear proteins (Viagen Biotech) were prepared (10 μg) and mixed with 10× binding buffer and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) for 30 min at room temperature, and then incubated with IR700-labeled oligonucleotide bio-NF-κB probe (5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′) for 30 min at room temperature, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The mixture was subjected to 6.5% native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at 180 V in 0.5× TBE buffer for 40 min at 4 °C. The gels were visualized using a GS-700 imaging densitometer (Bio-Rad). The binding specificity was examined by using excess (100-fold molar excess) unlabeled oligonucleotides (cold DNA probe). The cytosolic (where mitochondria were removed) and mitochondrial proteins were extracted from the brain tissue (Beyotime Biotechnology, Shanghai, China), separated by 15% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad). The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk (room temperature, 1 h), incubated overnight at 4 °C with a primary antibody (anti-cytochrome c, anti-Bcl-2, anti-Bax, anti-β-tubulin, or anti-COX-IV; Cell Signaling Technology), and then incubated with an HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) (room temperature, 1 h). The protein bands were visualized with a G-BOX imaging system (Syngene, Cambridge, UK) using an ECL assay kit (Pierce). The levels of the TNF-α and IL-1β proteins were measured by ELISA (USCN Life Science Inc., Wuhan, China). The rat brain tissues were homogenized on ice in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (Beyotime Biotechnology), and the homogenates were quantified using the BCA assay (Beyotime Biotechnology). The absorbance of the samples (450 nm) was measured using a microplate (BioTek) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The results were normalized to the total protein concentration. All samples were tested in duplicate. The statistical analyses were performed with SPSS version 17.0. The data are presented as the means ± S.D. A normality test and a homogeneity test for variance were performed first. If the data were in compliance with a normal distribution and homogeneity of variance, an ANOVA with Bonferroni's post-test or a Student's t test was performed; otherwise, a rank sum test was used. The categorical data were analyzed using the χ2 test. p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. We first analyzed whether NF-κB was activated in the cerebrum in the newborn rat kernicterus model. The EMSA results showed that NF-κB activity was markedly increased in the kernicterus model at 1 and 3 h (p = 0.012 and 0.044) and returned to basal levels at 6 h compared with the control group (Fig. 1A). Meanwhile, the specificity of the EMSA results was confirmed because the DNA binding was abolished after adding excess cold DNA probe, suggesting that the observed DNA binding activity is due to NF-κB (Fig. 1B). Subsequently, we investigated whether intraperitoneally administered TAT-NBD could inhibit NF-κB activation in the cerebrum of the rat kernicterus model. Based on the half-life of TAT-NBD and the peak time of NF-κB activity in the cerebrum, TAT-NBD was intraperitoneally administered at 0 and 2 h after the model was established. NF-κB activity was examined at 3 h after model establishment by EMSA. The NF-κB activation at 3 h was significantly inhibited in the TAT-NBD group compared with the vehicle group (p = 0.042) and the TAT-NBDmut group (p = 0.026; Fig. 1C). The clinical manifestations were scored dynamically every 2 h within 6 h after the insult, using a double-blind method. The results showed that abnormal neurological manifestations (such as clenched fists, opisthotonus, etc.) were observed in all bilirubin-treated rats, including the vehicle, TAT-NBD, and TAT-NBDmut groups, and the clinical manifestation scores in these three groups were higher than those of the control group (p < 0.001). Interestingly, the scores of the TAT-NBD group were significantly lower (p = 0.004 and 0.005) than those of the vehicle and TAT-NBDmut groups (Fig. 2A). There were no significant differences in the body weights of the control and TAT-NBD groups on postmodeling days 1, 2, and 3. However, the body weights in the vehicle and TAT-NBDmut groups were dramatically lower (p = 0.008 and 0.018) than those of the control group and showed a body weight loss on postmodeling day 1. Although all rats showed increased body weights on postmodeling days 2 and 3, the body weights in the vehicle and TAT-NBDmut groups were still significantly lower (postmodeling day 2, p = 0.003 and 0.006; postmodeling day 3, p = 0.003 and 0.014) than those of the control group (Fig. 2B). The mortality in each group was monitored after the model was established to postnatal day 28. The mortality of the TAT-NBD-treated rats was 11.7%, which was significantly lower than that of the vehicle (34.2%) and the TAT-NBDmut (37.1%) groups (p = 0.027 and 0.014, χ2 test, n = 30–35 animals/group). H&E staining 24 h after insult showed that the nerve cells in both the hippocampus and cerebral cortex were morphologically normal in the control group. Changes in the cellular morphology, including cytoplasmic condensation and endolysis, nuclear pyknosis, karyorrhexis, and karyolysis, were observed in the vehicle, TAT-NBD, and TAT-NBDmut groups. Nevertheless, the severity of these changes in the TAT-NBD group was relatively mild, compared with the vehicle and TAT-NBDmut groups (Fig. 3A). TUNEL staining was performed to assess the effect of TAT-NBD on the bilirubin-induced neuronal apoptosis. Compared with the control group, a large number of TUNEL-positive cells were observed in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of both the vehicle and TAT-NBDmut groups, whereas only a few cells were positively stained in the TAT-NBD group (Fig. 3B). The apoptosis rates in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex were calculated based on the average total number of cells and the number of TUNEL-positive cells in the pyramidal neuron layers of the CA1, CA2, CA3, and dentate gyrus regions of the hippocampus or in the cerebral cortex in eight randomly selected high magnification fields (×400) from three consecutive sections. The results showed that the apoptosis rate in the hippocampus was significantly reduced (both p < 0.001) in the TAT-NBD-treated rats (7.54 ± 0.45%) compared with the vehicle-treated (22.27 ± 1.92%) or TAT-NBDmut-treated rats (21.63 ± 1.22%); the apoptosis rate in the cerebral cortex was also significantly reduced in the TAT-NBD group (9.77 ± 2.46%) compared with the vehicle (14.00 ± 3.58%; p = 0.013) and TAT-NBDmut groups (14.30 ± 4.00%; p = 0.011; Fig. 3C). Changes in the expression of NF, a major component of the neuronal cytoskeleton, were examined to investigate UCB-induced neuronal injury. The control group exhibited a normal, organized structure of the neuronal cell body and neuronal arborization in both the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, whereas the vehicle, TAT-NBD, and TAT-NBDmut groups exhibited a loss of neuronal cells and a disordered neuron structure, accompanied by the loss of NF. However, these neuronal injuries were attenuated in the TAT-NBD group (Fig. 3D). Additionally, the areas (percentage of total) occupied by NF staining in the hippocampus (p = 0.023 and 0.014) and cerebral cortex (p = 0.005 and 0.002) in the TAT-NBD group were markedly increased compared with those in the vehicle and TAT-NBDmut groups (Fig. 3F). Many studies demonstrated that UCB could induce astrocytosis both in vitro and in vivo (5Brites D. Brito M.A. Stevenson D.K. Maisels M.J. Watchko J.F. Care of the Jaundiced Neonate.

Therefore, we subsequently used GFAP staining to investigate whether UCB-induced astrocytosis could be inhibited by TAT-NBD. The results showed that compared with the control group, the number of reactive astrocytes was apparently increased in the vehicle, TAT-NBD, and TAT-NBDmut groups. However, the TAT-NBD group exhibited a relatively lower number of GFAP-positive cells in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex (Fig. 3E), and the areas (percentage of total) occupied by the GFAP-positive staining were significantly decreased in the TAT-NBD group compared with the vehicle (p = 0.04 and 0.035) and TAT-NBDmut groups (p = 0.044 and 0.027; Fig. 3F). The Western blot results demonstrated that the TAT-NBD treatment markedly prevented the bilirubin-induced increase in the cytosolic cytochrome c levels compared with the vehicle and TAT-NBDmut groups (p = 0.002 and 0.013) 24 h after insult (Fig. 4A). The expression of Bax (the proapoptotic protein) and Bcl-2 (the antiapoptotic protein) in the mitochondria was also examined. The expression of Bax was dramatically decreased in the TAT-NBD group (p = 0.046 and 0.019; Fig. 4B), whereas the expression of Bcl-2 was significantly increased (p < 0.001) compared with the vehicle and TAT-NBDmut group (Fig. 4C). To evaluate whether the neuroprotective effects of TAT-NBD were mediated via the inhibition of cytokine release, the temporal secretion profiles of TNF-α and IL-1β were first investigated in this newborn rat kernicterus model. It can be shown that the cytokines were released in a time-dependent manner. TNF-α secretion began to increase at 1 h after model establishment, reached a peak level at 3 h (p = 0.029 versus the control group), and then decreased. IL-1β seemed to be up-regulated and reached a peak level at 6 h (p = 0.014 versus the control group) after model establishment an"
https://openalex.org/W1858758622,"The aim of this prospective study was to explore predictors of objective career success among Swedish women and men, focussing on gender differences. Data were drawn from the 2008 and 2010 waves of the Swedish Longitudinal Occupational Survey of Health (SLOSH) with a total of 3670 female and 2773 male participants. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for job promotion and an above-average salary increase between 2008 and 2010 were obtained through binary logistic regression analyses. Individual and organisational factors measured in 2008 were used as predictors in analyses stratified by sex. Mutual adjustment was performed for these variables, as well as for labour market sector and staff category at baseline. In both sexes, younger age predicted both job promotion and an above-average salary increase. Job promotion was also in both sexes predicted by being part of decision-making processes, having conflicts with superiors, and being eager to advance. Furthermore, promotion was predicted by, among men, being educated to post-graduate level and having an open coping strategy and, among women, working >60 hours/week. An above-average salary increase was predicted in both sexes by having a university education. Postgraduate education, having children living at home, and being very motivated to advance predicted an above-average salary increase among women, as did working 51-60 hours/week and being part of decision-making processes in men. Gender differences were seen in several predictors. In conclusion, the results support previous findings of gender differences in predictors of career success. A high level of education, motivation to advance, and procedural justice appear to be more important predictors of career success among women, while open coping was a more important predictor among men."

We found that fasting and peripheral insulin promote phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, respectively, of specific residues on brain proteins including cytoskeletal regulators such as slit-robo GTPase-activating protein 3 (srGAP3) and microtubule affinity-regulating protein kinases (MARKs), in which deficiency or dysregulation is linked to neurological disorders.

The phosphorylation of srGAP3 and MARKs were increased when PKA signaling was activated in primary neurons. Knockdown of PKA decreased the phosphorylation of srGAP3. Furthermore, WAVE1, a protein kinase A-anchoring protein, formed a complex with srGAP3 and PKA in the brain of fasted mice to facilitate the phosphorylation of srGAP3 by PKA. Although brain cells have insulin receptors, our findings are inconsistent with the down-regulation of phosphorylation of target proteins being mediated by insulin signaling within the brain. Rather, our findings infer that systemic insulin, through a yet unknown mechanism, inhibits PKA or protein kinase(s) with similar specificity and/or activates an unknown phosphatase in the brain. Ser858 of srGAP3 was identified as a key regulatory residue in which phosphorylation by PKA enhanced the GAP activity of srGAP3 toward its substrate, Rac1, in cells, thereby inhibiting the action of this GTPase in cytoskeletal regulation.

https://openalex.org/W1884342954,"Objectives The aim of the survey was to introduce knowledge of HPV's role in head and neck pathologies to general physicians (GPs), otorhinolaryngologists (ENTs) and newly graduated doctors, as well as to promote HPV-related diseases prevention. Study Design Cross-sectional study. Methods Self-designed questionnaire was sent to 2100 doctors. A total of 404 doctors, including 144 ENTs, 192 GPs and 68 trainees, responded. Results The majority of ENTs (86.8%) had contact with recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) and oropharyngeal cancers (OPCs) patients; in contrast, the majority of GPs (55.7%) did not (p = 0.00). The knowledge of HPV aetiology of cervical cancer versus OPCs and RRP was statistically higher. 7% of ENTs, 20% of GPs and 10% of trainees had not heard about HPV in oropharyngeal diseases. Women had greater knowledge than men. Both in the group of GPs and ENTs, 100% of respondents had heard about the impact of vaccination on the reduction of cervical cancer incidence. Only 39.11% of respondents had heard about the possibility of using vaccination against HPV in RRP—ENT doctors significantly more often than GPs and trainees (p = 0.00). Only 28.96% of physicians had heard about the potential value of HPV vaccination in preventing OPCs, including 44.44% of ENT doctors, 23.44% of GPs and 11.76% of trainees (p = 0.00). The doctors from district hospitals showed lower level of knowledge compared with clinicians (p = 0.04). Conclusions The different levels of knowledge and awareness of HPV issues highlight the need for targeted awareness strategies in Poland with implementation of HPV testing and vaccination. The information should be accessible especially to those with lower education levels: ENTs from small, provincial wards, GPs from cities of < 200 000 inhabitants and older physicians. The incorporation of HPV issues into the studies curriculum would be fruitful in terms of improving the knowledge of trainees."
https://openalex.org/W2264984798,"Activation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) is due to loss of von Hippel–Lindau protein (pVHL) function in most clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCCs). Here we describe a novel pVHL-independent mechanism of HIF regulation and identify nuclear factor (NF)-κB essential modulator (NEMO) as a hitherto unknown oncogenic factor influencing human ccRCC progression. Over 60% of human ccRCCs (n=157) have negative or weak NEMO protein expression by immunohistochemistry. Moderate/strong NEMO protein expression is more frequent in VHL wild-type ccRCCs. We show that NEMO stabilizes HIFα via direct interaction and independently of NF-κB signaling in vitro. NEMO prolongs tumor cell survival via regulation of apoptosis and activation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, facilitating tumor metastasis. Our findings suggest that NEMO-driven HIF activation is involved in progression of ccRCC. Therefore, NEMO may represent a clinically relevant link between NF-κB and the VHL/HIF pathways. Targeting NEMO with specific inhibitors in patients with metastatic ccRCC could be a novel treatment approach in patients with ccRCC expressing functional pVHL."
https://openalex.org/W2175901184,"Better understanding is needed for antihypertensive medication initiation and lifestyle modification among younger populations with elevated blood pressure. This study aimed to assess health behavior change after receiving a report of elevated blood pressure among African Americans and Caucasians younger than 50 years old. We used the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) repository dataset. By examination year twenty, 424 out of 2,478 Caucasian and 2,637 African American participants had received feedback from the CARDIA study due to elevated blood pressure readings. Blood pressure was measured by trained CARDIA researchers at the participant's home and was repeatedly recorded at seven examinations over twenty years. A feedback/referral letter was sent to participants with an elevated blood pressure reading. On average, participants first had an elevated blood pressure reading at the age of 34. After receiving the feedback letter, 44% of the previously undiagnosed participants received a formal diagnosis. In addition, 23% initiated the use of antihypertensive medication if they had not received medication treatment before. Among the participants with at-risk lifestyle behaviors, 40% reduced alcohol consumption, 14% increased exercise level, 11% stopped smoking, and 8% reached normal weight. While none of the studied patient factors were associated with lifestyle modification, age had a positive impact on antihypertensive medication initiation (p<0.05). We found no evidence of differences in health behavior change between African American and Caucasian participants after receiving the feedback letter. This research is one of the first to study what followed after receiving a feedback letter about elevated blood pressure outside of healthcare settings. Although additional referral care and behavior interventions are needed to facilitate medication initiation and lifestyle modification, our observations suggest that providing blood pressure feedback may have promise as part of a multi-method approach involving blood pressure screening and follow up."
https://openalex.org/W2468246922,"LepB is a key membrane component of the cellular secretion machinery, which releases secreted proteins into the periplasm by cleaving the inner membrane-bound leader. We showed that LepB is also an essential component of the machinery hijacked by the tRNase colicin D for its import.

The novel structural role of LepB results in a stable interaction with colicin D, with a stoichiometry of 1:1 and a nanomolar Kd determined in vitro.

The type I signal peptidase LepB (36 kDa) is an essential inner membrane enzyme of Escherichia coli and an integral part of the protein export machinery. LepB is a specialized serine protease that uses a Ser-90/Lys-145 catalytic dyad to perform the highly specialized task of removing the short N-terminal leader signal peptide of 15–30 amino acids from the N terminus of many secreted and membrane proteins (1Dalbey R.E.

Colicins are antibacterial toxins produced and released under stress conditions that selectively kill non-colicin producing strains. Colicin D is a toxic tRNase known to kill target cells by cleaving the anticodon loop of all four isoaccepting tRNAArg (4Tomita K. Ogawa T. Uozumi T. Watanabe K. Masaki H.

In this scenario LepB is specifically required for a late import step of colicin D (i.e. after the translocation step across the outer membrane). Moreover, the catalytic activity of LepB is not required for colicin D import and toxicity (8de Zamaroczy M. Buckingham R.H.

Most colicins (e.g. colicins E) have structurally identifiable N-terminal, central, and C-terminal domains. During early steps of import, the first two domains are required for receptor binding and translocation across the outer membrane, respectively, whereas the C-terminal domain is needed for killing activity (12Kleanthous C. Swimming against the tide: progress and challenges in our understanding of colicin translocation.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2010; 8: 843-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The colicin D protein has an unusual tripartite organization. The N-terminal domain is required for both the binding of the colicin to the high affinity, iron-siderophore receptor, FepA, and for its subsequent translocation across the outer membrane (13Braun V.

This hijacked function of FtsH during colicin import is coherent with its usual biological role of degrading misassembled or damaged membrane proteins (21Herman C. Prakash S. Lu C.Z. Matouschek A.

FtsH cleavage of non-native conformations of proteins.J. Struct. Biol. 2010; 171: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In the case of colicin D, the productive FtsH-dependent processing may be mediated by LepB. This unexpected function of LepB was suggested to involve in vitro an interaction with the central domain of colicin D (9Chauleau M. Mora L. Serba J. de Zamaroczy M.

In the present work we demonstrate in vitro that LepB forms a specific and highly stable complex with colicin D, and this interaction is essential for its import. We show that processing and translocation steps are dependent upon the colicin interaction with LepB. We report also that other RNase cytotoxins from two different species of Klebsiella need the novel non-catalytic activity of LepB to kill target cells. Genomic comparisons suggest that this LepB role is presumably required in the case of 10 other bacteriocins.

Open table in a new tab The 17 truncated colicin D derivatives (pColD -CD, -A, -B, -Del; Table 1) were created by PCR amplifications employing plasmid pColDI or pColDI(H611A) (carrying an inactivated catalytic domain) as template. The upstream oligonucleotide contained an NdeI restriction site including the ATG start codon in-frame with nucleotides of the cda (colicin D) coding sequence. The downstream oligonucleotide is complementary to cda and ended by an in-frame stop codon followed by a BamHI restriction site. A His6 tag was added to the 5′- or 3′-primer used in each amplification. PCR products after digestion were cloned into plasmid pET11c (Table 1) and transformed into DH5α strain. Using as template the plasmids pColDI, point mutations within the N-terminal part of the colicin D central domain (between positions 413–454) were generated by QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis method (Stratagene) to give the series of pColDI-mut (Table 1). Similarly, LepB mutants within the C-terminal conserved Box E (Gly-272–Arg-282) were generated by using as template the plasmid pLEPB1-wt (pLEPB1-mut; Table 1). Two oligonucleotide primers containing the desired mutation were used, each complementary to opposite strands of the plasmid, to generate the mutant derivatives. The mutated DNAs were subsequently transformed into XL1-Blue super-competent cells, prepared in the presence of 10 mm RbCl. Chimeric colicin D(A317)/klebicin D(E321) variant was created by the three-step PCR amplifications method, modified from Mora et al. (16Mora L. Klepsch M. Buckingham R.H. Heurgué-Hamard V. Kervestin S. de Zamaroczy M. Dual roles of the central domain of colicin D tRNase in TonB-mediated import and in immunity.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 4993-5003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Employing plasmid pColD1 (Table 1) as template, the first PCR used an upstream 113-mer oligonucleotide (containing a modified tac promoter and the cda ribosomal binding site, gctgaaatgagctgttgacaattaatcatcggctcgtataatgtgtggaattgtgagcggataacaatttcacacaaagaggtgttttt, followed by 30 nucleotides of the cda (colicin D) coding sequence starting from the fMet codon and a downstream oligonucleotide, complementary to cda and starting at A317, located upstream of the central domain. The second PCR amplification used an upstream oligonucleotide that is in part complementary to the downstream oligonucleotide used in the first PCR and that is in-frame with the codon E321 of kda (located at the start of the central domain of klebicin D) together with a downstream oligonucleotide, which is complementary to the stop codon of kdi (the immunity protein of klebicin D), using the plasmid pKlebD as template (Table 1), carrying the klebicin D operon. A denaturation-renaturation step of the mixed first two PCR products led to an annealing between complementary strands of the common amplified central part. This annealed DNA mix was employed as template for the third PCR amplification using the upstream oligo (first PCR) and the downstream oligo (second PCR), and this led to the amplification of a linear double-stranded chimeric colicin D/klebicin D DNA. The third PCR product was used directly as a template for in vitro protein synthesis. The same three-step PCR amplification technique was used to create hybrid colicin D(A317)/klebicin C(E223). Here the second PCR amplification used an upstream oligonucleotide that is in part complementary to the downstream oligonucleotide used in the first PCR (as described above), and it is in-frame with the codon E223 of kca (located upstream of the central domain of klebicin C) together with a downstream oligonucleotide complementary to the stop codon of kci (the immunity protein of klebicin C) by employing the plasmid pMC04-KlebC2 (Table 1) as template. Wild-type and hybrid constructs were expressed in vitro in a coupled transcription-translation, Zubay-S30 system from E. coli, optimized for linear DNA templates (Promega) at 37 °C for 60 min. Full-size wild-type colicin D in complex with the immunity protein carrying a C-terminal His6 tag was produced as previously described (9Chauleau M. Mora L. Serba J. de Zamaroczy M. FtsH-dependent processing of RNase colicins D and E3 means that only the cytotoxic domains are imported into the cytoplasm.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 29397-29407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) from BL21(DE3) cells carrying the plasmid pColDI. The complex was denaturated in 9 m urea, and then the His-tagged ImmD was retained by two passages over a Ni-NTA-agarose column (Protino, Macherey-Nagel), whereas the wild-type colicin D freed of ImmD present in the flow-through was concentrated after dialysis by ultrafiltration (Amicon Ultra-4 10K NMWL; Millipore). The 17 truncated, His-tagged colicin D derivatives (Table 1), including the whole or part of the central domain, and mutated colicin D-Imm(His6) (pColDI-mut; Table 1) complexes were expressed and eluted by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography at 200 mm imidazole. Truncated colicin Derivatives that were insoluble (for instance the CD) were purified from inclusion bodies. Crude cell extracts were centrifuged, and the pellet was resuspended in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.2 m NaCl containing 200 μg of DNase, antiprotease mixture tablet, and lysozyme 1 mg/ml, incubated 30 min at 4 °C, and then sonicated (4 × 1 min). After centrifugation, the pellet was resuspended for 30 min in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.2 m NaCl, and 9 m urea at 20 °C. After centrifugation, the supernatant was loaded onto Ni-NTA column, eluted as described above, dialyzed against 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5 (renaturation), and concentrated by ultrafiltration. His-tagged LepB, wild type or mutated, was produced from BL21(DE3) cells containing plasmid pLEPB1-wt, pLEPB(N274K), or pLEPB1-mut, respectively (Table 1). At A600 = 0.5 the expression of the LepB was induced by isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm), and incubation was continued for 3 h at 37 °C. LepB proteins were purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography (adapted from Paetzel et al. (23Paetzel M. Strynadka N.C. Tschantz W.R. Casareno R. Bullinger P.R. Dalbey R.E. Use of site-directed chemical modification to study an essential lysine in Escherichia coli leader peptidase.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9994-10003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar)). After centrifugation the cells were resuspended, incubated for 30 min at 4 °C in loading buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 0.1 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm imidazole containing 200 μg of DNase and antiprotease mixture tablet), and then broken by sonication. The supernatant was loaded onto a 1-ml Ni-NTA-agarose column and washed with 25 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 0.1 m NaCl, and 0.25% reduced Triton X-100 (a non-ionic and non-UV absorbing surfactant). The His-tagged solubilized LepB was eluted with 200 mm imidazole and then dialyzed against the same buffer. The D273A, R275A, and S281A mutant LepB could not be analyzed due to either their poor expression or the difficulty in extracting them from the detergent-solubilized membrane fraction. Purified, full-size (FS), wild-type colicin D, and LepB(His6) alone were analyzed individually by SEC. In addition, purified FS colicin D and a slight excess of His-tagged LepB were mixed in 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl, and 0.25% reduced Triton X-100, incubated for 1 h at 25 or 37 °C, and then analyzed by SEC. Purified proteins or protein mixes were run on a Superdex 200GL 10/300 column (GE Healthcare) monitored by an AKTA purifier FPLC system (GE Healthcare). 500-μl fractions were collected for detection of the LepB-colicin D complex and comparison of the SEC profile of the mixed proteins with that of colicin D or LepB analyzed alone. Proteins in the elution fractions were separated on 15% SDS-PAGE. The SPR biosensor real-time experiments were performed on a Biacore 2000 instrument (GE Healthcare) equilibrated at 25 or 37 °C with running buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.3 mm EDTA, 0.05% reduced Triton X-100). The SEC purified, His-tagged LepB protein (encoded by plasmid pLEPB1-wt or pLEPB(N274K)) was captured on Ni-NTA sensor chip (GE Healthcare) surface at an immobilization level of 150 resonance units (pg.mm−2). Colicin D was then injected at different concentrations with a flow rate of 20 μl min−1 for 750 s. The dissociation of the colicin D-LepB complexes was monitored for a 10-min flow of the running buffer without colicin D. The association and dissociation profiles were double-referenced, i.e. both the nonspecific background signals from a streptavidine-His6 reference surface and those from blank experiments (using running buffer without protein) were subtracted. The experimental data of six independent injections per concentration were overlaid and analyzed using the BIAevaluation 4.1 software (GE Healthcare) considering a 1:1 Langmuir binding model. The experimental SPR signals were normalized against the fitted maximum binding signal (Rmax), and the figures thus show the proportion of LepB molecules that are complexed on the y axis (“LepB site occupancy %”). Between binding assays, the surface was regenerated by successive injections of EDTA 0.35 m (2 min), NaOH 50 mm (1 min) and SDS 0.1% (1 min) followed by washing with the running buffer. To test the interaction of the N-terminally His-tagged CD of colicin D with the His-tagged LepB, the latter was covalently immobilized in an oriented fashion onto a nitrilotriacetic acid-derivatized sensorchip according to Jomain et al. (24Jomain J.B. Tallet E. Broutin I. Hoos S. van Agthoven J. Ducruix A. Kelly P.A. Kragelund B.B. England P. Goffin V.

Immobilized recombinant VEGF (at resonance units = 3000) receptor was used as a non-relevant control protein for the interaction. Colicin D CD was injected with a flow of 20 μl min−1 for 240 s and followed then by two regeneration injections of Gly-HCl 10 mm, pH 2.5. Purified truncated colicin D derivatives (2–5 μg) were separated on a 15% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and then stained by Amido Black. A denaturation-renaturation step according to Wu et al. (25Wu Y. Li Q. Chen X.Z. Detecting protein-protein interactions by Far Western blotting.Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 3278-3284Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) was performed to refold the proteins. After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C with purified wild-type LepB (1 μg/ml) and successive washing steps, the binding of LepB to colicins was analyzed by an anti-LepB antiserum and ECL. Data were collected in triplicate, and the LepB-binding rates averaged. The cytotoxicity of wild-type purified colicin D or colicin D molecules carrying point mutations in the central domain as well as hybrid colicin-klebicins synthesized in vitro (Zubay-S30) was analyzed in vivo by growth inhibition (halo) assay. Undiluted colicins (and 10-fold serial dilutions (5 μl) in the case of purified colicins) were spotted onto a lawn of sensitive AD202 or mutant A38 (carrying the LepB(N274K) mutation) cells on LB plates and then incubated overnight. To increase the binding of in vitro synthesized hybrid colicin Derivatives to the outer-membrane receptor FepA, the killing activity test was performed in the presence of the iron chelator 2,2′-dipyridyl (200 μm). Wild-type klebicin D was found to be non-toxic onto E. coli strains. 50-ml cultures of wild-type or mutant E. coli strains were grown in LB to A600 = 0.4 at 37 °C in the presence of 0.2 mm 2,2′-dipyridyl"
https://openalex.org/W2103079513,"Introduction Gene-set analysis (GSA) methods are used as complementary approaches to genome-wide association studies (GWASs). The single marker association estimates of a predefined set of genes are either contrasted with those of all remaining genes or with a null non-associated background. To pool the p-values from several GSAs, it is important to take into account the concordance of the observed patterns resulting from single marker association point estimates across any given gene set. Here we propose an enhanced version of Fisher’s inverse χ2-method META-GSA, however weighting each study to account for imperfect correlation between association patterns. Simulation and Power We investigated the performance of META-GSA by simulating GWASs with 500 cases and 500 controls at 100 diallelic markers in 20 different scenarios, simulating different relative risks between 1 and 1.5 in gene sets of 10 genes. Wilcoxon’s rank sum test was applied as GSA for each study. We found that META-GSA has greater power to discover truly associated gene sets than simple pooling of the p-values, by e.g. 59% versus 37%, when the true relative risk for 5 of 10 genes was assume to be 1.5. Under the null hypothesis of no difference in the true association pattern between the gene set of interest and the set of remaining genes, the results of both approaches are almost uncorrelated. We recommend not relying on p-values alone when combining the results of independent GSAs. Application We applied META-GSA to pool the results of four case-control GWASs of lung cancer risk (Central European Study and Toronto/Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute Study; German Lung Cancer Study and MD Anderson Cancer Center Study), which had already been analyzed separately with four different GSA methods (EASE; SLAT, mSUMSTAT and GenGen). This application revealed the pathway GO0015291 “transmembrane transporter activity” as significantly enriched with associated genes (GSA-method: EASE, p = 0.0315 corrected for multiple testing). Similar results were found for GO0015464 “acetylcholine receptor activity” but only when not corrected for multiple testing (all GSA-methods applied; p≈0.02)."
https://openalex.org/W2265069366,"Objectives Tumour microenvironment heterogeneity is believed to play a key role in cancer progression and therapy resistance. However, little is known about micro regional distribution of hypoxia, glycolysis and proliferation in spontaneous solid tumours. The overall aim was simultaneous investigation of micro regional heterogeneity of 64Cu-ATSM (hypoxia) and 18F-FDG (glycolysis) uptake and correlation to endogenous markers of hypoxia, glycolysis, proliferation and angiogenesis to better therapeutically target aggressive tumour regions and prognosticate outcome. Methods Exploiting the different half-lives of 64Cu-ATSM (13h) and 18F-FDG (2h) enabled simultaneous investigation of micro regional distribution of hypoxia and glycolysis in 145 tumour pieces from four spontaneous canine soft tissue sarcomas. Pairwise measurements of radioactivity and gene expression of endogenous markers of hypoxia (HIF-1α, CAIX), glycolysis (HK2, GLUT1 and GLUT3), proliferation (Ki-67) and angiogenesis (VEGFA and TF) were performed. Dual tracer autoradiography was compared with Ki-67 immunohistochemistry. Results Micro regional heterogeneity in hypoxia and glycolysis within and between tumour sections of each tumour piece was observed. The spatial distribution of 64Cu-ATSM and 18F-FDG was rather similar within each tumour section as reflected in moderate positive significant correlations between the two tracers (ρ = 0.3920–0.7807; p = 0.0180 –<0.0001) based on pixel-to-pixel comparisons of autoradiographies and gamma counting of tumour pieces. 64Cu-ATSM and 18F-FDG correlated positively with gene expression of GLUT1 and GLUT3, but negatively with HIF-1α and CAIX. Significant positive correlations were seen between Ki-67 gene expression and 64Cu-ATSM (ρ = 0.5578, p = 0.0004) and 18F-FDG (ρ = 0.4629–0.7001, p = 0.0001–0.0151). Ki-67 gene expression more consistently correlated with 18F-FDG than with 64Cu-ATSM. Conclusions Micro regional heterogeneity of hypoxia and glycolysis was documented in spontaneous canine soft tissue sarcomas. 64Cu-ATSM and 18F-FDG uptakes and distributions showed significant moderate correlations at the micro regional level indicating overlapping, yet different information from the tracers.18F-FDG better reflected cell proliferation as measured by Ki-67 gene expression than 64Cu-ATSM."
https://openalex.org/W1847862908,"This paper proposes a modified BFGS formula using a trust region model for solving nonsmooth convex minimizations by using the Moreau-Yosida regularization (smoothing) approach and a new secant equation with a BFGS update formula. Our algorithm uses the function value information and gradient value information to compute the Hessian. The Hessian matrix is updated by the BFGS formula rather than using second-order information of the function, thus decreasing the workload and time involved in the computation. Under suitable conditions, the algorithm converges globally to an optimal solution. Numerical results show that this algorithm can successfully solve nonsmooth unconstrained convex problems."
https://openalex.org/W2113623491,"Iron overload is associated with acquired and genetic conditions, the most common being hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) type-I, caused by HFE mutations. Here, we conducted a hospital-based case-control study of 41 patients from the São Miguel Island (Azores, Portugal), six belonging to a family with HH type-I pseudodominant inheritance, and 35 unrelated individuals fulfilling the biochemical criteria of iron overload compatible with HH type-I. For this purpose, we analyzed the most common HFE mutations- c.845G>A [p.Cys282Tyr], c.187C>G [p.His63Asp], and c.193A>T [p.Ser65Cys]. Results revealed that the family's HH pseudodominant pattern is due to consanguineous marriage of HFE-c.845G>A carriers, and to marriage with a genetically unrelated spouse that is a -c.187G carrier. Regarding unrelated patients, six were homozygous for c.845A, and three were c.845A/c.187G compound heterozygous. We then performed sequencing of HFE exons 2, 4, 5 and their intron-flanking regions. No other mutations were observed, but we identified the -c.340+4C [IVS2+4C] splice variant in 26 (74.3%) patients. Functionally, the c.340+4C may generate alternative splicing by HFE exon 2 skipping and consequently, a protein missing the α1-domain essential for HFE/ transferrin receptor-1 interactions. Finally, we investigated HFE mutations configuration with iron overload by determining haplotypes and genotypic profiles. Results evidenced that carriers of HFE-c.187G allele also carry -c.340+4C, suggesting in-cis configuration. This data is corroborated by the association analysis where carriers of the complex allele HFE-c.[187C>G;340+4T>C] have an increased iron overload risk (RR = 2.08, 95% CI = 1.40-2.94, p<0.001). Therefore, homozygous for this complex allele are at risk of having iron overload because they will produce two altered proteins--the p.63Asp [c.187G], and the protein lacking 88 amino acids encoded by exon 2. In summary, we provide evidence that the complex allele HFE-c.[187C>G;340+4T>C] has a role, as genetic predisposition factor, on iron overload in the São Miguel population. Independent replication studies in other populations are needed to confirm this association."
