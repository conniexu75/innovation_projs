https://openalex.org/W2927513003,"Soil moisture is one of the main factors in agricultural production and hydrological cycles, and its precise prediction is important for the rational use and management of water resources. However, soil moisture involves complex structural characteristics and meteorological factors, and it is difficult to establish an ideal mathematical model for soil moisture prediction. Existing prediction models have problems such as prediction accuracy, generalization, and multi-feature processing capability, and prediction performance must improve. Based on this, taking the Beijing area as the research object, the deep learning regression network (DNNR) with big data fitting capability was proposed to construct a soil moisture prediction model. By integrating the dataset, analyzing the time series of the predictive variables, and clarifying the relationship between features and predictive variables through the Taylor diagram, selected meteorological parameters can provide effective weights for moisture prediction. Test results prove that the deep learning model is feasible and effective for soil moisture prediction. Its' good data fitting and generalization capability can enrich the input characteristics while ensuring high accuracy in predicting the trends and values of soil moisture data and provides an effective theoretical basis for water-saving irrigation and drought control."
https://openalex.org/W2925959057,"Landscapes are becoming increasingly urbanized, causing loss and fragmentation of natural habitats, with potentially negative effects on biodiversity. Insects are among the organisms with the largest diversity in urbanized environments. Here, we sampled predator (Ampulicidae, Sphecidae and Crabronidae) and parasitoid (Tachinidae) flower-visiting insects in 36 sites in the city of Rome (Italy). Although the diversity of herbivorous insects in urban areas mostly depends on the availability of flowering plants and nesting sites, predators and parasitoids generally require a larger number of resources during their life cycle, and are expected to be particularly influenced by urbanization. As flower-visitors can easily move between habitat patches, the effect of urbanization was tested at multiple spatial scales (local, landscape and sub-regional). We found that urbanization influenced predator and parasitoid flower-visitors at all three spatial scales. At the local scale, streets and buildings negatively influenced evenness of predators and species richness and abundance of parasitoids probably acting as dispersal barrier. At the landscape scale, higher percentage of urban decreased predator abundance, while increasing their evenness, suggesting an increase in generalist and highly mobile species. Area and compactness (i.e. Contiguity index) of urban green interactively influenced predator communities, whereas evenness of parasitoids increased with increasing Contiguity index. At the sub-regional scale, species richness and abundance of predators increased with increasing distance from the city center. Compared to previous studies testing the effect of urbanization, we found little variation in species richness, abundance and evenness along our urbanization gradient. The current insect fauna has been probably selected for its tolerance to habitat loss and fragmentation, being the result of the intensive anthropogenic alteration occurred in the area in the last centuries. Conservation strategies aimed at predator and parasitoid flying insects have to take in account variables at multiple spatial-scales, as well as the complementarity of resources across the landscape."
https://openalex.org/W2932608807,"Nanoparticles (NPs) are causing threats to the environment. Silver NPs (AgNPs) are increasingly used in commercial products and may end up in freshwater ecosystems. The freshwater organisms are vulnerable due to water-borne and dietary exposure to AgNPs. Surface properties play an important role in the fate and behavior of AgNPs in the aquatic environment and their effects on organisms. However, effects of surface properties of AgNPs on organisms are poorly understood. In this study, we explored the effects of AgNPs coated with three different ligands; Tyrosine (T-AgNP), Epigallocatechin gallate (E-AgNP) and Curcumin (C-AgNP) in relation to the toxicity to a key aquatic organism; Daphnia carinata. The study focused on how coatings determine fate of NPs in the medium, mortality, feeding behaviour, bioaccumulation and trophic transfer from the freshwater alga, Raphidocelis subcapitata to daphnids. NP stability tests indicated that T-AgNPs were least stable in the ASTM daphnia medium while C-AgNPs were most stable. 48 h EC50 values of AgNPs to D. carinata were in the order of E-AgNP (19.37 μg L-1) > C-AgNP (21.37 μg L-1) > T-AgNP (49.74 μg L-1) while the 48 h EC50 value of Ag+ ions was 1.21 μg L-1. AgNP contaminated algae significantly decreased the feeding rates of daphnids. However, no significant differences were observed in feeding rates between algae contaminated with differently coated AgNPs. Trophic transfer studies showed that AgNPs were transferred from algae to daphnids. The bioacumulation of AgNPs in algae and the diet-borne bioaccumulation of AgNPs in daphnids varied for differently coated AgNPs. Bioaccumulation of C-AgNPs in algae was 1.5 time higher than T-AgNPs. However, the accumulation of T-AgNPs in daphnids via trophic transfer was 2.6 times higher than T-AgNPs. The knowledge generated from this study enhances the understanding of surface property dependent toxicity, bioaccumulation and trophic transfer of AgNPs in aquatic environments."
https://openalex.org/W2932241874,"The innate immune system in insects is regulated by specific signalling pathways. Most immune related pathways were identified and characterized in holometabolous insects such as Drosophila melanogaster, and it was assumed they would be highly conserved in all insects. The hemimetabolous insect, Rhodnius prolixus, has served as a model to study basic insect physiology, but also is a major vector of the human parasite, Trypanosoma cruzi, that causes 10,000 deaths annually. The publication of the R. prolixus genome revealed that one of the main immune pathways, the Immune-deficiency pathway (IMD), was incomplete and probably non-functional, an observation shared with other hemimetabolous insects including the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum) and the bedbug (Cimex lectularius). It was proposed that the IMD pathway is inactive in R. prolixus as an adaptation to prevent eliminating beneficial symbiont gut bacteria. We used bioinformatic analyses based on reciprocal BLAST and HMM-profile searches to find orthologs for most of the “missing” elements of the IMD pathway and provide data that these are regulated in response to infection with Gram-negative bacteria. We used RNAi strategies to demonstrate the role of the IMD pathway in regulating the expression of specific antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) in the fat body of R. prolixus. The data indicate that the IMD pathway is present and active in R. prolixus, which opens up new avenues of research on R. prolixus-T. cruzi interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2930785527,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease worldwide, particularly in obese and type 2 diabetic individuals. NAFLD ranges in severity from benign steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH); and NASH can progress to cirrhosis, primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and liver failure. As such, NAFLD has emerged as a major public health concern. Herein, we used a lipidomic and transcriptomic approach to identify lipid markers associated with western diet (WD) induced NASH in female mice.Female mice (low-density lipoprotein receptor null (Ldlr -/-) were fed a reference or WD diet for 38 and 46 weeks. Transcriptomic and lipidomic approaches, coupled with statistical analyses, were used to identify associations between major NASH markers and transcriptomic & lipidomic markers.The WD induced all major hallmarks of NASH in female Ldlr -/- mice, including steatosis (SFA, MUFA, MUFA-containing di- and triacylglycerols), inflammation (TNFα), oxidative stress (Ncf2), and fibrosis (Col1A). The WD also increased transcripts associated with membrane remodeling (LpCat), apoptosis & autophagy (Casp1, CtsS), hedgehog (Taz) & notch signaling (Hey1), epithelial-mesenchymal transition (S1004A) and cancer (Gpc3). WD feeding, however, suppressed the expression of the hedgehog inhibitory protein (Hhip), and enzymes involved in triglyceride catabolism (Tgh/Ces3, Ces1g), as well as the hepatic abundance of C18-22 PUFA-containing phosphoglycerolipids (GpCho, GpEtn, GpSer, GpIns). WD feeding also increased hepatic cyclooxygenase (Cox1 & 2) expression and pro-inflammatory ω6 PUFA-derived oxylipins (PGE2), as well as lipid markers of oxidative stress (8-iso-PGF2α). The WD suppressed the hepatic abundance of reparative oxylipins (19, 20-DiHDPA) as well as the expression of enzymes involved in fatty epoxide metabolism (Cyp2C, Ephx).WD-induced NASH in female Ldlr -/- mice was characterized by a massive increase in hepatic neutral and membrane lipids containing SFA and MUFA and a loss of C18-22 PUFA-containing membrane lipids. Moreover, the WD increased hepatic pro-inflammatory oxylipins and suppressed the hepatic abundance of reparative oxylipins. Such global changes in the type and abundance of hepatic lipids likely contributes to tissue remodeling and NASH severity."
https://openalex.org/W2926157944,"Exposure to intrauterine inflammation (IUI) is associated with short- and long-term adverse perinatal outcomes. However, little data exist on utilizing placenta to prognosticate fetal injury in this scenario. Our study aimed to utilize imaging modalities to evaluate mechanisms contributing to placental injury following IUI exposure and correlated it to concomitant fetal brain injury. CD1 pregnant dams underwent laparotomies and received intrauterine injections of either lipopolysaccharide (LPS; a model of IUI) or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). In utero ultrasound Doppler velocimetry of uterine and umbilical arteries and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of placental volumes with confirmatory immunohistochemical (vimentin) and histochemistry (fibrin) analyses were performed. ELISA for thrombosis markers, fibrinogen and fibrin was performed to analyze thrombi in placenta. Fetal brain immunohistochemistry was performed to detect microglial activation (ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1, Iba1). On ultrasound, LPS group demonstrated elevated resistance indices, pulsatility indices and a greater occurrence of absent end-diastolic flow in the umbilical and uterine arteries. In the fetus, there was an increased cardiac Tei indices in the LPS group. MRI revealed decreased volume of placenta in the LPS group associated with placental thinning and placental endothelial damage on immunohistochemistry. Decreased fibrinogen content and more thrombi staining in placenta exposed to maternal LPS indicated the hypercoagulability. Furthermore, the expression of Iba1was significantly associated with placental thickness (r = -0.7890, Pearson correlation coefficient). Our data indicate that IUI can trigger events leading to maternal placental malperfusion and fetal vessel resistance, as well as predispose the developing fetus to cardiac dysfunction and brain damage. Furthermore, our data suggest that prenatal ultrasound can be a real-time clinical tool for assessing fetal risk for adverse neurologic outcomes following the potential IUI exposure."
https://openalex.org/W2934182649,"Amebiasis, caused by Entamoeba histolytica (E. histolytica), is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in developing countries. Mortality due to amebiasis is mostly by extra intestinal infections, amebic liver abscess being the most common one. This study was conducted to determine the current epidemiological status, risk factors, associated microflora and strain variation of E. histolytica causing liver abscesses.A total of 115 liver abscess cases comprising of 107 (93%) males and 8 (6.9%) females were included in the study. Microscopic examination of pus samples from the abscesses and species discrimination using nested multiplex PCR showed the presence of E. histolytica in 101 (87.5%) cases. Data collected by face to face interviews using a pre tested questionnaire suggested intake of untreated drinking water (ORs: 6.4, p = 0.002), habit of alcohol consumption (ORs: 4.0, p = 0.019) and lack of urban services (ORs: 0.08, p = 0.017) to be major risk factors associated with E. histolytica infections. The study of associated bacterial flora through aerobic culture of liver aspirates and conventional PCR for detection of anaerobes revealed the presence of Fusobacterium (19, 25.5%), Peptococcus (19, 25.5%), Prevotella (18, 24.3%), Bacteroides (8, 10.8%), Staphylococcus aureus (3, 4%), Escherichia coli (2, 2.7%), Peptostreptococcus (2, 2.7%), Clostridium (2, 2.7%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (1, 1.3%). Further to study the clonality, genotyping of E. histolytica targeting six tRNA-linked polymorphic STR loci (A-L, D-A, N-K, R-R, STGA -D and S-Q) was carried out which showed the presence of 89 different genotypes in the liver aspirate samples.The findings highlight the high prevalence of genetically diverse E. histolytica from the liver abscess cases in this geographical region. Low socio-economic status and habit of alcohol consumption were important predictors of amebic liver abscess."
https://openalex.org/W2935045016,"Background Antenatal care (ANC) is critical to decrease maternal and neonatal mortality. However, little is known about the utilization of ANC services in Pakistan. This study assessed the utilization of ANC in Sindh province, Pakistan, and identified the factors that affect its use. Methods We analysed a subset of data from Maternal and Child Health (MCH) Program Indicator Surveys conducted in Sindh province, Pakistan in 2013 and 2014. Respondents included 10,200 women who had given birth in the past two years. The outcome measure was making at least four ANC visits. Logistic regression models were used to identify demographic, socioeconomic, characteristics of ANC, and informational factors associated with ANC use. Results Most women (83.5%) received one or more ANC, mostly by doctors (95%), but only 57.3% of them made the recommended four or more visits, and just 53.7% received their initial ANC care during the first trimester. Making four or more ANC visits was associated with: fewer household occupants (odds ratio [OR] = 0.98; 95% confidence interval [CI] = [0.97, 0.99]), large city residence (OR = 1.92; 95% CI = [1.57, 2.35]), higher women’s education (OR = 1.70; 95% CI = [1.33, 2.15]), greater household wealth (OR = 5.66; 95% CI = [4.22, 7.60]), and receiving MCH information from lady health worker (OR = 1.17; 95% CI = [1.00, 1.37]), mother-in-law (OR = 1.17; 95% CI = [1.01, 1.36]), other relatives/friends (OR = 1.19; 95% CI = [1.03, 1.38]), or nurse/midwife (OR = 1.31; 95% CI = [1.06, 1.61]). Conclusions This study demonstrates that both socioeconomic factors and health information sources are associated with women’s use of ANC. Therefore, programs should target socially disadvantaged and vulnerable groups, particularly rural, less educated, and poor women, to improve utilization of ANC. In addition, strategies to increase exposure to MCH information sources should be a priority in Sindh, Pakistan."
https://openalex.org/W2934627959,"The thyroid hormones have been reported to be associated with cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s disease. The relationship between thyroid function within the normal range and cerebral blood flow in Alzheimer’s disease patients has been shown in a recent study. Mild cognitive impairment is often the first stage of Alzheimer’s disease; thus, early diagnosis is important. The present study investigated the relationship between thyroid function and regional cerebral blood flow in patients with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease. A total of 122 memory clinic outpatients who underwent thyroid function testing and single photon emission computed tomography were divided into mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer’s disease, and Normal groups. Regional cerebral blood flow was calculated using a three-dimensional stereotactic region of interest template in an automated cerebral perfusion single photon emission computed tomography analysis system. Multiple regression analysis adjusted for age and sex was conducted to examine the relationships between thyroid hormones and regional cerebral blood flow. Thyroid stimulating hormone was significantly associated with regional cerebral blood flow in the bilateral temporal, bilateral pericallosal, and bilateral hippocampal regions in the mild cognitive impairment group. In the Alzheimer’s disease group, free triiodothyronine was significantly associated with regional cerebral blood flow in the bilateral parietal, right temporal, and bilateral pericallosal regions. The present study showed the association of thyroid stimulating hormone with regional cerebral blood flow in the mild cognitive impairment group and the association of free triiodothyronine with regional cerebral blood flow in the Alzheimer’s disease group. These study findings could contribute to the early diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment at general memory clinics and the prevention of subsequent progression to Alzheimer’s disease."
https://openalex.org/W2926986268,"The Brazil nut tree (Bertholletia excelsa) is an iconic and economically valuable species that dominates vast swathes of the Amazon Basin. This species seems to have been an important part of human subsistence strategies in the region from at least the Early Holocene, and its current distribution may be a legacy of past human settlement. Because B. excelsa is a long-lived pioneer tree it requires natural or human disturbances to increase light availability in the understory for a successful establishment. However, it remains unclear how the long-term population dynamics of this species have been shaped by pre-colonial and post-colonial human practices. Here, we use tree-ring analyses to look at changes in growing conditions over the past 400 years in a Brazil nut tree population in Central Amazonia. We identify changes in tree recruitment and growth rates associated not only with regional climatic variability, but also major political and socio-economic activities recorded by historical documents in the vicinity of Manaus. We demonstrate that the expansion of a post-colonial political center (Manaus) from the middle of the 18th century onwards coincided with a reduction in recruitment of B. excelsa. We argue that this hiatus suggests the interruption of indigenous management practices, probably due to the collapse of pre-Columbian societies. A second recruitment pulse, and unprecedented cycles of growth release and suppression, aligns with a shift to modern exploitation of the forest into the 20th century. Our findings shed light on how past histories of human-forest interactions can be revealed by the growth rings of trees in Amazonia. Future interdisciplinary analysis of these trees should enable more detailed investigation of how human forest management has changed in this part of the world, through pre-colonial, colonial, and industrial periods of human activity, with potential implications for conservation."
https://openalex.org/W2929018547,"Introduction The Affordable Care Act (ACA) expanded the coverage of Medicaid to include entire population with income below 138% of federal poverty line. It remains unclear whether this policy change has improved access to and utilization of health care, particularly use of mammography and Pap tests among poor women. Methods We used a difference-in-difference (DID) design to estimate the impact of Medicaid expansion on mammography and Pap tests utilization among low-income women. Expansion states are the treatment group and non-expansion states are the control group. The years 2012–13 are the pre-expansion period and 2015–16 are the post-expansion period for the purpose of estimating the DID parameters. Results The difference-in-difference estimate show that likelihood of utilizing mammograms did not change significantly among low-income women after the implementation of Medicaid expansion (DID coefficient -0.0476 with t-statistics at -1.26), Pap test decreased (coefficient -0.0615, t-statistics -2.76), and Medicaid enrollment has increased significantly among low-income women living in expansion states (coefficient 0.0889 with t-value of 3.68). Conclusion Expansion of Medicaid was associated with increased Medicaid enrollment but did not yield near-term improvement in use of mammography and Pap tests among low-income women. Factors beyond health insurance coverage may be important in determining the likelihood of obtaining these screenings. Policy makers should try to identify other barriers to cancer screenings among low-income women in the USA."
https://openalex.org/W2931478392,"Purpose Various profibrotic and proinflammatory cytokines have been found upregulated in uncomplicated primary retinal detachment (pRD), but without providing a uniform picture. Here, we compare the cyto- and chemokine profiles in pRD with and without proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) in an attempt to unravel relevant differences not in single cytokines, but in the cytokine profiles at diagnosis. Methods Undiluted vitreous fluid (VF) was obtained at the beginning of surgery from 174 eyes with pRD without relevant PVR (maximally grade B; group 1; n = 81) and with moderate or advanced PVR requiring a gas tamponade (group 2; n = 49) or silicon oil filling (group 3; n = 44). VF of eyes undergoing macular hole (MH) surgery served as controls (group 4; n = 26). Forty-three cytokines were quantified in parallel using a multiplex cytokine analysis system (Bioplex). For all comparisons we applied Holm’s correction to control for multiple comparisons. Results 44.9% of group 2 eyes presented grade C1 and 55.1% C2-C3, whereas 86.4% of group 3 eyes exhibited a PVR grade of C2-D. CCL19 was the only cytokine that displayed higher concentrations in the vitreous of eyes with PVR C1 compared to lower PVR grades. Eyes with PVR C2-D showed higher levels of CCL27, CXCL6, IL4, IL16, CXCL10, CCL8, CCL22, MIG/CXCL9, CCL15, CCL19, CCL 23 and CXCL12 compared to controls. Interestingly, no difference of cytokine levels was detected between C1 and C2-D PVR. Conclusions CCL19 may represent a potential biomarker for early PVR progression that holds promise for future diagnostic and therapeutic applications."
https://openalex.org/W2928437641,"Finding new HIV-positive cases remains a priority to achieve the UNAIDS goals. An enhanced peer outreach approach (EPOA) was implemented to expand the delivery of HIV services to female sex workers (FSWs) and men who have sex with men (MSM) in three countries in West and Central Africa. The aim of EPOA is to identify new HIV-positive cases. EPOA was implemented in Burundi among FSWs, and in Cote d’Ivoire and Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) among both FSWs and MSM. Implementation ranged from five to nine weeks and was nested within a three-month reporting period. Standard outreach was suspended for the duration of EPOA implementation but was resumed thereafter. Summary service statistics were used to compare HIV seropositivity during standard outreach and EPOA. Trends were analyzed during the quarter in which EPOA was implemented, and these were compared with the two preceding quarters. Differences in proportions of HIV seropositivity were tested using Pearson’s chi-square test; p-values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Overall, EPOA resulted in a higher proportion of new HIV-positive cases being found, both within and between quarters. In Burundi, HIV seropositivity among FSWs was significantly higher during EPOA than during standard outreach (10.8% vs. 4.1%, p<0.001). In Cote d’Ivoire, HIV seropositivity was significantly higher during EPOA among both populations (FSWs: 5.6% vs. 1.81%, p<0.01; MSM: 15.4% vs. 5.9%; p<0.01). In DRC, HIV seropositivity was significantly higher during EPOA among MSM (6.9% vs. 1.6%; p<0.001), but not among FSWs (5.2% vs. 4.3%; p = 0.08). Trends in HIV seropositivity during routine outreach for both populations were constant during three successive quarters but increased with the introduction of EPOA. EPOA is a public health approach with great potential for reaching new populations and ensuring that they are aware of their HIV status."
https://openalex.org/W2932296176,"Intraspecific interactions between individuals or groups of individuals of the same species are an important component of population dynamics. Interactions can be static, such as spatial overlap, or dynamic based on the interactions of movements, and can be mediated through communication, such as the deployment of scent marks. Interactions and their behavioural outcomes can be difficult to determine, especially for species that live at low densities. With the use of GPS collars we quantify both static and dynamic interactions between male cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) and the behavioural outcomes. The 99% home-ranges of males overlapped significantly while there was little overlap of the 50% home-ranges. Despite this overlap, male cheetahs rarely came into close proximity of one another, possibly because presence was communicated through frequent visits to marking posts. The minimum distance between individuals in a dyad ranged from 89m to 196m but the average proximity between individuals ranged from 17,145 ± 6,865m to 26,367 ± 11,288m. Possible interactions took place more frequently at night than by day and occurred mostly in the 50% home-range of one individual of a dyad or where cores of both individuals overlapped. After a possible encounter male cheetahs stayed in close proximity to each other for up to 6 hours, which could be the result of a territory defence strategy or the presence of a receptive female. We believe that one of the encounters between a singleton and a 5-male coalition resulted in the death of the singleton. Our results give new insights into cheetah interactions, which could help our understanding of ecological processes such as disease transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2925873600,"Increased global regulation and restrictions on the non-therapeutic use of antibiotics in the poultry industry means that there is a need to identify alternatives that prevent infection while still conveying the growth and performance benefits afforded by their use. Biochars are produced by the incomplete pyrolysis of organic materials, with reports of use as a feed supplement and activity against pathogenic bacteria. In the current study the dose-dependent effects of biochar dietary inclusion in layer diets at 1%, 2% and 4% w/w were investigated to determine a) the efficacy of biochar as an anti-pathogenic additive on the intestinal microbiota and b) the optimal inclusion level. Biochar inclusion for anti-pathogenic effects was found to be most beneficial at 2% w/w. Poultry pathogens such as Gallibacterium anatis and campylobacters, including Campylobacter hepaticus, were found to be significantly lower in biochar fed birds. A shift in microbiota was also associated with the incorporation of 2% w/w biochar in the feed in two large scale trials on two commercial layer farms. Biochar inclusion for anti-pathogenic effects was found to be most beneficial at 2% w/w. Differential effects of the timing of biochar administration (supplementation beginning at hatch or at point of lay) were also evident, with greater impact on community microbial structure at 48 weeks of age when birds were fed from hatch rather than supplemented at point of lay."
https://openalex.org/W2926812488,"Many disciplines of scholarship are interested in the Relative Age Effect (RAE), whereby age-banding confers advantages on older members of the cohort over younger ones. Most research does not test this relationship in a manner consistent with theory (which requires a decline in frequency across the cohort year), instead resorting to non-parametric, non-directional approaches. In this article, the authors address this disconnect, provide an overview of the benefits associated with Poisson regression modelling, and two managerially useful measures for quantifying RAE bias, namely the Indices of Discrimination and Wastage. In a tutorial-like exposition, applications and extensions of this approach are illustrated using data on professional soccer players competing in the top two tiers of the “Big Five” European football leagues in the search to identify paragon clubs, leagues, and countries from which others may learn to mitigate this form of age-discrimination in the talent identification process. As with OLS regression, Poisson regression may include more than one independent variable. In this way we test competing explanations of RAE; control for unwanted sources of covariation; model interaction effects (that different clubs and countries may not all be subject to RAE to the same degree); and test for non-monotonic versions of RAE suggested in the literature."
https://openalex.org/W2928805057,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections are amongst the leading public health concerns in Pakistan with a high disease burden. Despite the availability of effective antiviral treatments in the country the disease burden in general population has not lowered. This could be attributed to the asymptomatic nature of this infection that results in lack of diagnosis until the late symptomatic stage. To better estimate and map HCV infections in the country a population-based analysis is necessary for an effective control of the infection.Serologic samples of ~66,000 participants from all major cities of the Punjab province were tested for anti-HCV antibodies. The antibody-based seroprevalence was associated with socio-demographic variables including geographical region, age, gender and sex, and occupation.Overall serological response to HCV surface antigens was observed in over 17% of the population. Two of the districts were identified with significantly high prevalence in general population. Analysis by occupation showed significantly high prevalence in farmers (over 40%) followed by jobless and retired individuals, laborers and transporters. A significant difference in seroprevalence was observed in different age groups amongst sex and genders (male, female and transgender) with highest response in individuals of over 40 years of age. Moreover, most of the tested IDUs showed positive response for anti-HCV antibody.This study represents a retrospective analysis of HCV infections in general population of the most populated province of Pakistan to identify socio-demographic groups at higher risk. Two geographical regions, Faisalabad and Okara districts, and an occupational group, farmers, were identified with significantly high HCV seroprevalence. These socio-demographic groups are the potential focused groups for follow-up studies on factors contributing to the high HCV prevalence in these groups towards orchestrating effective prevention, control and treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2933761970,"Neanderthals had complex land use patterns, adapting to diversified landscapes and climates. Over the past decade, considerable progress has been made in reconstructing the chronology, land use and subsistence patterns, and occupation types of sites in the Rhône Valley, southeast France. In this study, Neanderthal mobility at the site of Payre is investigated by combining information from lithic procurement analysis (“chaîne evolutive” and “chaîne opératoire” concepts) and strontium isotope analysis of teeth (childhood foraging area), from two units (F and G). Both units date to the transition from Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 8 to MIS 7, and show similar environmental conditions, but represent contrasting occupation durations. Level Gb (unit G) represents a long-term year-round use, in contrast to short-term seasonal use of the cave in level Fb (unit F). For both levels, lithic material and food were generally collected from a local to semi-local region. However, in level Gb, lithic materials were mainly collected from colluviums and food collected in the valley, whereas in level Fb, lithic procurement focused primarily on alluvial deposits and food was collected from higher elevation plateaus. These procurement or exchange patterns might be related to flint availability, knapping advantages of alluvial flint or occupation duration. The site of Payre is located in a flint rich circulation corridor and the movement of groups or exchanges between groups were organized along a north-south axis on the plateaus or towards the east following the river. The ridges were widely used as they are rich in flint, whereas the Rhône Valley is not an important source of lithic raw materials. Compared to other western European Middle Palaeolithic sites, these results indicate that procurement strategies have a moderate link with occupation types and duration, and with lithic technology. The Sr isotope ratios broadly match the proposed foraging areas, with the Rhône Valley being predominantly used in unit G and the ridges and limestone plateaus in unit F. While lithic reconstructions and childhood foraging are not directly related this suggests that the three analysed Neanderthals spend their childhood in the same general area and supports the idea of mobile Neanderthals in the Rhône Valley and neighbouring higher elevation plateaus. The combination of reconstructing lithic raw material sources, provisioning strategies, and strontium isotope analyses provides new details on how Neanderthals at Payre practised land use and mobility in the Early Middle Palaeolithic."
https://openalex.org/W2926337455,"Next generation sequencing (NGS) studies have demonstrated a rich and diverse ocular surface-associated microbiota in people that was previously undetected by traditional culture-based methods. The ocular surface microbiome of horses has yet to be investigated using NGS techniques. This study aimed to determine the bacterial composition of the ocular surface microbiome in healthy horses, and to identify whether there are microbial community changes over time and following topical antibiotic use. One eye of 12 horses was treated 3 times daily for 1 week with neomycin-polymyxin-bacitracin ophthalmic ointment. Contralateral eyes served as untreated controls. The inferior conjunctival fornix of both eyes was sampled at baseline prior to initiating treatment (day 0), after 1 week of treatment (day 7), and 4 weeks after concluding treatment (day 35). Genomic DNA was extracted from ocular surface swabs and sequenced using primers that target the V4 region of bacterial 16S rRNA. At baseline, the most abundant phyla identified were Proteobacteria (46.1%), Firmicutes (24.6%), Actinobacteria (12.6%), and Bacteroidetes (11.2%). The most abundant families included Pasteurellaceae (13.7%), Sphingomonadaceae (7.9%), an unclassified Order of Cardiobacteriales (7.7%), and Moraxellaceae (4.8%). Alpha and beta diversity measurements were unchanged in both treatment and control eyes over time. Overall, the major bacterial taxa on the equine ocular surface remained stable over time and following topical antibiotic therapy."

We evaluated morphometric patterns in wing length and bill length by age and sex, when possible, and assessed if wing shape has also changed during this time-period. We investigated patterns of morphological change in two additional Calidridine sandpipers, white-rumped sandpipers (Calidris fuscicollis) and least sandpipers (Calidris minutilla), to determine if shorter wing lengths are a widespread pattern in small sandpipers. We also examined allometric changes in wing and bill lengths to clarify if wing length declines were consistent with historical scaling relationships and indicative of a change in body size instead of only wing length change. We found that including sex and wing shape in analyses revealed important patterns in morphometric change for semipalmated sandpipers. Wing lengths declined for both sexes, but the magnitude of decline was smaller and not significant for males. Additionally, semipalmated sandpiper wings have become more convex, a shape that increases maneuverability in flight. Wing lengths, but not bill lengths, declined for most species and age classes, a pattern that was inconsistent with historical allometric scaling relationships. For juvenile semipalmated sandpipers, however, both bill and wing lengths declined according to historical scaling relationships, which could be a consequence of nutritional stress during development or a shift in the proportion of birds from smaller-sized, western breeding populations. Except for juvenile semipalmated sandpipers, we did not find evidence for an increase in the proportion of birds from different breeding populations at the stopover site. Given the wide, hemispheric distribution of these sandpipers throughout their annual cycles, our results, paired with those from a previous study, provide evidence for wide-spread reduction in wing lengths of Calidridine sandpipers since the 1980s. The shorter wing lengths and more convex wing shapes found in this study support the hypothesis that selection has favored more maneuverable wing morphology in small sandpipers."
https://openalex.org/W2934248698,"Synchronized oscillatory gamma-band activity (30-100Hz) has been suggested to constitute a key mechanism to dynamically orchestrate sensory information integration across multiple spatio-temporal scales. We here tested whether interhemispheric functional connectivity and ensuing auditory perception can selectively be modulated by high-density transcranial alternating current stimulation (HD-tACS). For this purpose, we applied multi-site HD-tACS at 40Hz bilaterally with a phase lag of 180° and recorded a 64-channel EEG to study the oscillatory phase dynamics at the source-space level during a dichotic listening (DL) task in twenty-six healthy participants. In this study, we revealed an oscillatory phase signature at 40Hz which reflects different temporal profiles of the phase asymmetries during left and right ear percept. Here we report that 180°-tACS did not affect the right ear advantage during DL at group level. However, a follow-up analysis revealed that the intrinsic phase asymmetries during sham-tACS determined the directionality of the behavioral modulations: While a shift to left ear percept was associated with augmented interhemispheric asymmetry (closer to 180°), a shift to right ear processing was elicited in subjects with lower asymmetry (closer to 0°). Crucially, the modulation of the interhemispheric network dynamics depended on the deviation of the tACS-induced phase-lag from the intrinsic phase asymmetry. Our characterization of the oscillatory network trends is giving rise to the importance of phase-specific gamma-band coupling during ambiguous auditory perception, and emphasizes the necessity to address the inter-individual variability of phase asymmetries in future studies by tailored stimulation protocols."
https://openalex.org/W2934962725,"A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group comparative clinical study was conducted to examine the effects of ubiquinol (the reduced form of Coenzyme Q10) on secretion of saliva. This interventional study enrolled 40 subjects aged 65 years or younger who were healthy, but noted slight dryness of the mouth. Subjects were randomized with stratification according to gender and age to ingestion of gummy candy containing 50 mg of ubiquinol or placebo twice daily for 8 weeks. At the end of study, along with a significant increase of the CoQ10 level in saliva (p = 0.025*, d = 0.65), there was a significant increase of the saliva flow rate (p = 0.048*, d = 0.66) in the ubiquinol candy group (n = 18; 47.4±6.2 years; 6 men and 12 women) compared to the placebo group (n = 20; 52.2±7.7 years; 4 men and 16 women). The strength of the stomatognathic muscles was not significantly enhanced by ingestion of ubiquinol candy. Compared with baseline, significant improvement of the following four questionnaire items was observed in the ubiquinol group at the end of the study: feeling tired (p = 0.00506, d = −0.726), dryness of the mouth (p = 0.04799, d = −0.648), prone to catching a cold (p = 0.00577, d = −0.963), and diarrhea (p = 0.0166, d = −0.855). There were no serious adverse events. An in vitro study revealed that ubiquinol stimulated a significant and concentration-dependent increase of ATP production by a cell line derived from human salivary gland epithelial cells (p<0.05), while 1 nM ubiquinol significantly suppressed (p = 0.028) generation of malondialdehyde by cells exposed to FeSO4-induced oxidative stress. These findings suggest that ubiquinol increases secretion of saliva by suppressing oxidative stress in the salivary glands and by promoting ATP production.

https://openalex.org/W2935276239,"Annually, more than 1.2 million scorpion stings and more than 3,000 deaths occur worldwide. Tityus serrulatus Lutz and Mello, 1922 (Scorpiones, Buthidae) is the most medically relevant species in Brazil where it is spreading rapidly and causing over 90,000 cases of envenomation yearly. We monitored T. serrulatus longevity and ability to reproduce under conditions of food and/or water deprivation. We found that T. serrulatus is highly tolerant to food deprivation, with individuals enduring up to 400 days without food. On the other hand, access to water played a pivotal role in T. serrulatus survival. Food and water deprived scorpions showed weight reduction. Reproduction occurred throughout the year for food-deprived scorpions and controls, but not in the water-deprived groups. Remarkably, food-deprived animals were able to give birth after 209 days of starvation. Tityus serrulatus resistance to food and water deprivation is likely to be an additional factor underlying this species' geographic expansion and the difficulties encountered in controlling it."
https://openalex.org/W2928699303,"Here we described a new trypanosomatid species, Phytomonas lipae, parasitizing the dock bug Coreus marginatus based on axenic culture and in vivo material. Using light and electron microscopy we characterized the development of this flagellate in the intestine, hemolymph and salivary glands of its insect host. The intestinal promastigotes of Phytomonas lipae do not divide and occur only in the anterior part of the midgut. From there they pass into hemolymph, increasing in size, and then to salivary glands, where they actively proliferate without attachment to the host's epithelium and form infective endomastigotes. We conducted molecular phylogenetic analyses based on 18s rRNA, gGAPDH and HSP83 gene sequences, of which the third marker performed the best in terms of resolving phylogenetic relationships within the genus Phytomonas. Our inference demonstrated rather early origin of the lineage comprising the new species, right after that of P. oxycareni, which represents the earliest known branch within the Phytomonas clade. This allowed us to compare the development of P. lipae and three other Phytomonas spp. in their insect hosts and reconstruct the vectorial part of the life cycle of their common ancestor."
https://openalex.org/W2934493362,"Prisoners have a higher risk of suicide compared to non-incarcerated individuals. One aim of suicide prevention for prisoners is to identify risk factors in order to put stronger support mechanisms in place for the more vulnerable detainees. This study investigates the suicide risk (SR) in offence-related sub-populations in a representative German sample and differentiates between SR for adolescent and adult prisoners.Conducting a national study with data from public German records on the entire prison population from 2000 to 2016 and suicide numbers in German prisons in the same period, SR was calculated for the total male prison population as well as for both subgroups, adolescent and adult male prisoners.In the study period, male prisoners spent 959.584 life years (LY) in German criminal detention. Among those, 524 prisoners died of suicide. SR was higher for detainees imprisoned for an offence resulting in extensive physical harm for another person, e.g. homicide (suicide rate = 134,8 suicides per 100.000 LY; OR = 2,47; CI95%: 1,98-3,08), bodily injury (suicide rate = 87,3; OR = 1,60; CI95%: 1,29-1,99), and sexual offences (suicide rate = 84,2; OR = 1,54; CI95%: 1,18-2,01) compared with the SR of the total prison population (suicide rate = 54.6). Age differences between offence-related SR were found for theft, with adolescents (suicide rate = 69,3; OR = 1,25; CI95%: 0,85-1,84) showing higher SR than adults (suicide rate = 38,2; OR = 0,7; CI95%: 0,54-0,92).The index offence of detainees is associated with SR and age-related differences exist. Suicide prevention in prisons should take both into account to determine populations at risk."
https://openalex.org/W4240730629,"Based on the entire population of Nobel laureates in science from 1901 to 2017, we show that North America’s rise as global power in science started in the 1920s. Following a transition period (1940s to 1960s), its scientific hegemony was consolidated in the 1970s. Yet since the 2000s, North America’s global leadership in science has come under pressure. In that time, its share of laureates across disciplines dropped, although it has retained its attractiveness as a destination for future laureates from Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. In addition, we find that North America has become apparently less effective since 2010 in transferring capacities for conducting ground-breaking research from one generation of scientists to another. Furthermore, both Europe and the Asia-Pacific region have similarly high shares of newcomer organizations with regard to where prize-winning work is conducted, indicating that these two regions are very active in the inter-organizational competition for scientific talent. Despite this competition, however, we find no support for the rise of a new global center of science."
https://openalex.org/W2934623286,"Stress granules (SGs) are transient cytoplasmic mRNA and protein complexes that form in eukaryotic cells under stress. SGs are related to multiple diseases, but there are no reports of the existence of SGs in atrial fibrillation (AF).Cell models of AF were established by field stimulation at 600 times per minute. HL-1 cells, cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts were transfected with G3BP1-cDNA plasmid by Lipofectamine 2000. The presence of SGs was detected by immunofluorescence analysis against GTPase-activating protein SH3 domain binding protein 1 (G3BP1) and poly(A)-binding protein 1 (PABP-1) and electron microscopy. Stable HL-1 cell lines transfected with lentivirus overexpressing G3BP1were constructed to further induce the formation of SGs in AF. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and calcium overload in tachypaced HL-1 cells were studied by flow cytometry. The effects of G3BP1 overexpression on cardiac fibroblast proliferation and the protein expression level of collagen I/III and fibronectin-1 were also studied. Additionally, we detected protein synthesis in general and in single cells by puromycin incorporation in paced HL-1 cells. Here, we first showed that SGs are present in both tachypaced mouse cardiomyocytes and HL-1 atrial cells, although the presence is partial and at a low level. G3BP1 overexpression promoted SG formation, inhibited the rapid pacing-induced increase in ROS level, and attenuated calcium overload in HL-1 cells (all P<0.05). Furthermore, G3BP1 overexpression inhibited cardiac fibroblast proliferation (P<0.05) and decreased the protein expression level of collagen I and fibronectin-1 in cardiac fibroblasts stimulated by angiotensin II (all P<0.05). The bulk puromycin incorporation analyzed by Western blot did not show a global reduction in protein synthesis. However, puromycin incorporation in single cells detected by immunofluorescence analysis showed that protein synthesis in SG-containing cells significantly reduced (P<0.01).SGs are rapidly induced and present partially in AF, and G3BP1 overexpression promotes SG formation and confers cytoprotection against oxidative stress, calcium overload and atrial fibrosis in AF."
https://openalex.org/W2926891287,"Colour polymorphism is a widespread phenomenon and often encompasses different behavioural traits and strategies. More recently, it has been shown that morphs can also signal consistent individual differences (personality). An example are Gouldian finches that show discrete head colour morphs in the same population with red-headed birds being more aggressive but less risk-taking and explorative than black-headed birds in the lab. The current study aimed to investigate the link between head colour and behavioural traits in a naturally risky situation in the wild by recording the order of descent at waterholes in relation to hypotheses considering conspicuousness, dominance relationships and experience. Other bird species at the waterholes were also included in the study. Adult Gouldian finches generally preceded juveniles and among the adults the least conspicuous black-headed females descended first to the waterhole. Overall, females descended before the males though this pattern disappeared later in the season likely due to family groups breaking up and releasing males from attending to the juveniles. Finally, Gouldian finches almost always followed other species, particularly Long-tailed finches, to the ground rather than taking the lead. A two-level process of decision-making seems to explain the responses best: on the first level, experience separates adults from juveniles with adults preceding juveniles and on the second level, conspicuousness acts as a factor among the adults with the least conspicuous category taking the lead. Future studies should directly test the link between head colour and personality in the wild, look more into seasonal effects and investigate whether Gouldian finches use Long-tailed finches as an indicator of safety."
https://openalex.org/W2927398394,"Many developing countries are in a state of nutritional transition from prevalent under-nutrition to the emergent problem of over-nutrition (overweight and obesity), which is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, and whose complications can persist into adulthood with long-term consequences. However, data are limited on the risk factors for overweight and obesity (O&O) among primary school children, particularly those in rural and semi-urban areas in these countries.To determine the socio-demographic factors associated with overweight and obesity among primary school children in semi-urban areas.1187 school pupils aged 6-11 years recruited from semi-urban areas using multistage sampling were interviewed for risk factors of overweight and obesity using a structured questionnaire. Nutritional status was assessed using body mass index and this was classified using a standard method. The proportions were compared using Pearson's chi-squared. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was also carried out with overweight and obesity as the dependent variable and socio demographic factors as independent variables. The level of statistical significance was set at p <0.05 in all the statistical analyses.Fifty-eight pupils (4.9%) had overweight and obesity while 1129 (95.1%) were either of normal nutritional status (1088, 91.6%) or were thin/severely thin (41, 3.5%). Among those with overweight and obesity, 41 (3.5%) were overweight and 17 (1.4%) obese. A higher prevalence of overweight and obesity was significantly associated (in unadjusted analysis) with female gender [unadjusted Odds Ratio, OR (95% CI) = 2.42 (1.37, 4.28)], attendance at private schools [OR (95% CI) = 3.34 (1.86, 6.00)], higher socio-economic status families [OR (95% CI) = 2.32 (1.65, 5.80)] and presence of a television in the pupil's bedrooms [OR (95% CI) = 2.22 (1.02, 4.82)] on bivariate analyses. However, only gender, school type and family socioeconomic status were independently associated with overweight and obesity on multivariate logistic regression analysis.We conclude that overweight and obesity among primary school pupils in semi-urban areas is associated with female gender, attendance at private schools and higher socioeconomic status families. Preventive programmes should accordingly be more directed at children from affluent families; particularly those who are females and those attending private schools."
https://openalex.org/W2932567421,"Racial/ethnic disparities in rates of influenza vaccinations in the US remain an issue even among those with access, no out-of-pocket costs, and after adjusting for confounders. We used an approach called the Oaxaca-Blinder (OB) decomposition method to ascertain the contribution of covariates individually and in aggregate to the racial disparity in influenza vaccination.We included members > = 18 years of age as of 05/01/2014 with continuous enrollment through 04/30/2015. Influenza vaccination was defined by diagnosis, procedure, or medication codes, or documentation in the immunization table. Characteristics were reported by race. Logistic regression models estimated the odds of vaccination associated with: (1) race; and (2) covariates stratified by race. The Oaxaca-Blinder (OB) method calculated the contribution of covariates to the difference or disparity in vaccination between Blacks and Whites.We found that among adults, 44% were vaccinated; 55% were Black; and 45% were White. Black members have 42% lower odds of vaccination than White members. The contribution of the differences in the average value of the study covariates between Black and White members (the OB covariate effect) accounted for 29% of the racial disparity. The contributions to the total White-Black disparity in vaccination included: age (16%), neighborhood median income (11%), and registration on the online patient portal (13%). The contribution of the differences in how the covariates impact vaccination (OB coefficient effect) accounted for 71% of the disparity in vaccination between Blacks and Whites.In conclusion, equalizing average covariate values in Blacks and Whites could reduce the racial disparity in influenza vaccination by 29%. For health system vaccine campaigns, improving registration on the patient portal may be a target component of an effective system-level strategy to reduce racial disparities in vaccination. Additional information on patient-centered factors could further improve the value of the OB approach."
https://openalex.org/W2888673677,"Motion at constant speed in the world maps into retinal motion very differently for lateral motion and motion in depth. The former is close to linear, for the latter, constant speed objects accelerate on the retina as they approach. Motion in depth is frequently studied using speeds that are constant on the retina, and are thus not consistent with real-world constant motion. Our aim here was to test whether this matters: are we more sensitive to real-world motion? We measured speed change discrimination for objects undergoing accelerating retinal motion in depth (consistent with constant real-world speed), and constant retinal motion in depth (consistent with real-world deceleration). Our stimuli contained both looming and binocular disparity cues to motion in depth. We used a speed change discrimination task to obtain thresholds for conditions with and without binocular and looming motion in depth cues. We found that speed change discrimination thresholds were similar for accelerating retinal speed and constant retinal speed and were notably poor compared to classic speed discrimination thresholds. We conclude that the ecologically valid retinal acceleration in our stimuli neither helps, nor hinders, our ability to make judgements in a speed change discrimination task."
https://openalex.org/W2928445069,"The objectives are to determine neural dynamics during gait using electro-encephalography and source localization, and to investigate the attentional demand during walking in able-bodied individuals, and individuals with an amputation.Six able-bodied individuals conducted one experimental trial, and 6 unilateral transtibial and 6 unilateral transfemoral amputees performed 2 experimental trials; the first with the prosthesis currently used by the subjects and the second with a novel powered transtibial prosthesis, i.e. the Ankle Mimicking Prosthetic foot 4.0. Each experimental trial comprised 2 walking tasks; 6 and 2 minutes treadmill walking at normal speed interspersed by 5 minutes of rest. During 6 minutes walking the Sustained Attention to Response (go-no go) Task, which measures reaction time and accuracy, was performed. Electro-encephalographic data were gathered when subjects walked 2 minutes. Motor-related cortical potentials and brain source activity during gait were examined. Normality and (non-) parametric tests were conducted (p<0.05).In contrast to transtibial amputees, transfemoral amputees required more attentional demands during walking with Ankle Mimicking Prosthetic foot 4.0 compared to the current passive prosthetic device and able-bodied individuals (reaction time and accuracy: p≤0.028). Since risk of falling is associated with altered attentional demands, propulsive forces of the novel device need to be better controlled for transfemoral amputees. No motor-related cortical potentials at Cz were observed in transfemoral amputees walking with the novel prosthesis, whereas motor-related cortical potentials between transtibial amputees and able-bodied individuals during walking at normal speed did not differ. The first positive electro-physiological peak deflection appeared during toe-off phase and showed higher activity within the underlying brain sources in transtibial amputees walking with Ankle Mimicking Prosthetic foot 4.0 compared to able-bodied individuals. The required higher neural input to accomplish the same physical activity compared to able-bodied individuals is possibly due to the limited acclimation period to the novel device and consequently increased afferent sensory feedback for postural control."
https://openalex.org/W2928492424,"The extent to which native fish communities might control the success of invasive fish has been of interest to ecologists, but it has been rarely addressed using experiments. We conducted an experiment in six small lakes in the Upper Mississippi Region to test the effects of a small native predator, bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus) on the recruitment of a large, invasive fish, the common carp (Cyprinus carpio). Bluegills are predominant throughout the region and were previously shown to consume carp eggs and larvae. We stocked both lakes at each of our 3 sites with adult carp (spawners) and one lake at each site with bluegills. We repeated the experiment at two of the three sites for two consecutive years. In each lake we assessed the abundance of post-larval carp one month after spawning (backpack electrofishing surveys) and at the end of the season (mark-recapture). For each site/year combination, catch rate of post-larval carp was typically an order of magnitude higher in control than bluegill lakes, but it often declined quickly over time. The abundance of end-of-seasonal juveniles was significantly higher (no 95% CI overlap) in control lakes than in bluegill lakes, except for one pair of lakes during one year when both the control and bluegill lake had similar, low abundance of end-of-season carp. Overall, our results support the hypothesis that common carp recruitment is substantially reduced in habitats dominated by bluegills. We also suggest our results may be applicable to other species, and that managers should explore how predation on early life stages may control other invasive species."

With little infection data since its discovery, the zoonotic potential of this Brucella species is largely unknown. Recent reports of isolation from human cerebrospinal fluid, along with current literature suggest that B. neotomae has the ability to infect various hosts and cell types. In this report we extend the knowledge of B. neotomae ATCC 23459’s intracellular invasion and survival abilities to a variety of cell lines through gentamicin protection assays. Some of the phagocytic and epithelial cell lines from various mammalian species represent characteristics of some cell types that could be encountered by Brucella in potential hosts. It was found that B. neotomae ATCC 23459 exhibits generally lower intracellular bacterial CFUs compared to the mouse-passaged strain of B. neotomae ATCC 23459, B. suis 1330, and B. abortus 2308. Ultimately, these observations provide a small piece of the puzzle in the investigation of the breadth of B. neotomae’s pathogenic potential."
https://openalex.org/W2926636107,"Forests have become increasingly fragmented throughout the US, with residential development serving as the primary driver of these changes. These altered landscapes have provided suitable conditions for a broad range of wildlife, including blacklegged ticks and their hosts. Lawns dominate residential landscapes, and thus their management has the potential to reduce the likelihood of contact with ticks in residential yards. We tested the hypothesis that lawn mowing frequency influences tick occurrence in 16 suburban yards in Springfield, MA. We conducted 144 tick drags in lawns of various lawn mowing frequencies (mowed every week, every 2-weeks and every 3-weeks) and did not collect any ticks of any species. Promoting frequent mowing (i.e., shorter lawns) and the removal of grass clippings could have minimal impacts on tick microhabitats, but is consequential for beneficial wildlife and other ecosystem services associated with urban biodiversity."
https://openalex.org/W2932707041,"Though it is an essential process, transcription can be a source of genomic instability. For instance, it may generate RNA:DNA hybrids as the nascent transcript hybridizes with the complementary DNA template. These hybrids, called R-loops, act as a major cause of replication fork stalling and DNA breaks. In this study, we show that lowering transcription and R-loop levels in plastids of Arabidopsis thaliana reduces DNA rearrangements and mitigates plastid genome instability phenotypes. This effect can be observed on a genome-wide scale, as the loss of the plastid sigma transcription factor SIG6 prevents DNA rearrangements by favoring conservative repair in the presence of ciprofloxacin-induced DNA damage or in the absence of plastid genome maintenance actors such as WHY1/WHY3, RECA1 and POLIB. Additionally, resolving R-loops by the expression of a plastid-targeted exogenous RNAse H1 produces similar results. We also show that highly-transcribed genes are more susceptible to DNA rearrangements, as increased transcription of the psbD operon by SIG5 correlates with more locus-specific rearrangements. The effect of transcription is not specific to Sigma factors, as decreased global transcription levels by mutation of heat-stress-induced factor HSP21, mutation of nuclear-encoded polymerase RPOTp, or treatment with transcription-inhibitor rifampicin all prevent the formation of plastid genome rearrangements, especially under induced DNA damage conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2926208182,"A common task in the immunodetection of structurally close compounds is to analyze the selectivity of immune recognition; it is required to understand the regularities of immune recognition and to elucidate the basic structural elements which provide it. Triazines are compounds of particular interest for such research due to their high variability and the necessity of their monitoring to provide safety for agricultural products and foodstuffs. We evaluated the binding of 20 triazines with polyclonal (pAb) and monoclonal (mAb) antibodies obtained using atrazine as the immunogenic hapten. A total of over 3000 descriptors were used in the quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) analysis of binding activities (pIC50). A comparison of the two enzyme immunoassay systems showed that the system with pAb is much easier to describe using 2D QSAR methodology, while the system with mAb can be described using the 3D QSAR CoMFA. Thus, for the 3D QSAR model of the polyclonal antibodies, the main statistical parameter q2 (‘leave-many-out’) is equal to 0.498, and for monoclonal antibodies, q2 is equal to 0.566. Obviously, in the case of pAb, we deal with several targets, while in the case of mAb the target is one, and therefore it is easier to describe it using specific fields of molecular interactions distributed in space."
https://openalex.org/W2929450989,"Group living animals produce vocalizations denominated “contact calls” to maintain contact with out-of-sight group members. These calls have been shown to vary with caller identity and distance to potential listeners. However, it is not clear whether the acoustic variation of contact calls is related to caller social isolation (e.g., inside or outside a subgroup) and listeners’ responses that can be helpful to maintain contact. Here, we addressed these questions in spider monkeys (Ateles geoffroyi), a Neotropical primate that exchanges contact calls denominated “whinnies”, which show graded variation related to caller immediate behavior and distance between callers. Using 566 whinnies produced by 35 free-ranging adult spider monkeys recorded at ≤ 20 m from microphones, we first analyzed whether the acoustic variation of spontaneous whinnies (i.e., whinnies that are not responses to previous whinnies) is related to caller social isolation or whether acoustic variation is related to the likelihood of eliciting a response whinny from another individual. Secondly, we assessed whether listeners’ responses (i.e., time to respond vocally, acoustic characteristics of response whinnies, orienting behaviors) were related to the acoustic variation of previous whinnies. Our study revealed that callers that were outside a subgroup produced whinnies with a lower fundamental frequency (F0), which travels longer distances, and increases the likelihood of producing a response whinny. Moreover, listeners (i.e., responders) responded faster to lower F0 whinnies. However, the acoustic variation (i.e., F0 variation) in response whinnies was better explained by the separation distance between callers, than by the acoustic variation of the previous whinny. Overall, our results suggest that whinny variation facilitates vocal contact to callers that are outside a subgroup, and that context and whinny variation affect listeners’ responses."
https://openalex.org/W2929832325,"Advanced therapies are increasingly demanded by patients with the intent of treating some incurable conditions. Because family medicine professionals play an important role as health educators, their residency programs should incorporate new knowledge related to advanced therapies. To successfully implement these programs, how family medicine residents perceive these therapies should be investigated. The main components of perception, i.e. conceptual, procedural and attitudinal, refer to knowledge, skills and feelings, respectively.We designed a specific questionnaire to assess the components of perceptions of advanced therapies in 300 medical residents enrolled in the Spanish National Family Medicine Residency Program. Each component consisted of 4 or 5 topics and each topic contained 6 items. Respondents scored highest in the procedural component (average 4.12±1.00), followed by the attitudinal (3.94±1.07) and conceptual component (3.04±1.43). Differences among the three components were statistically significant (p<0.00017). Family medicine residents perceived that procedures to implement advanced therapies are well established, especially their application. However, they felt their cognitive background was insufficient to respond efficiently to the expectations generated by these new therapeutic tools, especially in the regulatory framework. High awareness of the risks and limitations of these treatments was reflected by residents' preference for clinically tested therapies. Although they appropriately situated treatment with these therapies within hospital care, they associated the biofabrication of novel products with research centers, although these therapeutic tools can be produced in different facilities.These results are potentially useful for designing future training programs and health policies for family medicine residents, and suggest the need to implement specific training programs in advanced therapies at the conceptual, procedural and attitudinal level."
https://openalex.org/W2932483937,"Understanding HIV incidence and risk behaviour among populations being considered for HIV vaccine studies is necessary for the appropriate design of trials.Between May 2012 and June 2015, we recruited men aged 18-49 years from urban and peri-urban areas of Rustenburg, a mining town in the North West Province, South Africa. Men who reported HIV-risk behaviour were followed for nine to 12 months to determine HIV incidence and factors associated with condom use.A total of 400 HIV uninfected men were enrolled; 366 (91.5%) had at least one follow-up visit and were included in the analysis; 47.6% were under 25 years of age. HIV incidence was 1.9 per 100 person-years (95% CI: 0.79-4.56). Among heterosexual men (N = 339), 80.8% reported having vaginal intercourse with multiple partners in the past three months, among whom 74.1% reported inconsistent condom use. Sixty-eight percent reported vaginal intercourse with new female partners, of whom 40.6% reported inconsistent condom use. Over half (55.6%) of men who had sex with men (N = 27) reported anal intercourse with multiple male partners in the past three months, of whom 68.2% reported using condoms inconsistently. Men who had more than two female partners in the last three months (n = 121) were more likely to use condoms inconsistently (aOR 4.31, 95% CI: 1.34-13.8); in contrast, those with more than one new female sex partner (aOR 0.13, 94% CI 0.04-0.44), and whose sexual debut was after 19 years of age (aOR 0.39, 95% CI: 0.15-1.01) were less likely to use condoms inconsistently.HIV incidence was low and similar to other studies of heterosexual men in South Africa. To identify men at high risk for HIV for enrolment in prevention trials, future researchers may need to focus on those who report early sexual debut and who report having multiple sexual partners. Men in newer relationships appear to use condoms more frequently."
https://openalex.org/W2933591438,"Evaluating allocation system effects on lung transplantation and determining systemic flaws is difficult. The purpose of this study was to assess the Korean urgency-based lung allocation system using the lung allocation score.We reviewed transplantation patients retrospectively. Candidates were classified into groups based on urgency. Status 0 designated hospitalized patients requiring ventilator and/or extracorporeal life support. The lung allocation score was calculated based on the recipient's condition at transplantation.One-hundred-twenty-three Status 0, 1, and 2/3 patients (40, 71, and 12, respectively) were enrolled. The median waiting time was 68 days. Nineteen Status 0 patients who received lung transplants deteriorated from non-Status 0 (median, 64 days). The lung allocation score showed a bimodal distribution (peaks around 45 and 90, corresponding with non-Status 0 and Status 0, respectively). Status 0 and the lung allocation score were independent risk factors for poor survival after adjustment for confounders (Status 0, hazard ratio, 2.788, p = 0.001; lung allocation score, hazard ratio, 1.025, p < 0.001). The lung allocation score cut-off for survival was 44. On dividing the non-Status 0 patients into 2 groups using the cut-off values and regrouping into Status 0, non-Status 0 with high lung allocation score (> 44), and non-Status 0 with low lung allocation score (< 44), we observed that non-Status 0 with high lung allocation score patients had better survival than Status 0 patients (p = 0.020) and poorer survival than non-Status 0 with low lung allocation score patients (p = 0.018).The LAS demonstrated the characteristics of LTx recipients in Korea and the Korean allocation system needs to be revised to reduce the number of patients receiving LTx in Status 0. The LAS system could be used as a tool to evaluate lung allocation systems in countries that do not use the LAS system."
https://openalex.org/W2932290001,"The E1B 55kDa produced by human adenovirus type 5 is a multifunctional protein that participates in the regulation of several steps during the viral replication cycle. Previous studies suggest this protein plays an important role in postranscriptional regulation of viral and cellular gene expression, as it is required for the selective accumulation of maximal levels of viral late mRNA in the cytoplasm of the infected cell; however the molecular mechanisms that are altered or regulated by this protein have not been elucidated. A ribonucleoprotein motif that could implicate the direct interaction of the protein with RNA was initially predicted and tested in vitro, but the interaction with RNA could not be detected in infected cells, suggesting the interaction may be weak or transient. Here it was determined that the E1B 55kDa interacts with RNA in the context of the viral infection in non-transformed human cells, and its contribution to the adenovirus replication cycle was evaluated. Using recombinant adenoviruses with amino acid substitutions or a deletion in the ribonucleoprotein motif the interaction of E1B 55kDa with RNA was found to correlate with timely and efficient viral DNA replication and viral late mRNA accumulation and splicing."
https://openalex.org/W2927756888,"Objectives Compare the molecular epidemiology of tuberculosis (TB) between two large Canadian provinces–Ontario and British Columbia (BC)–to identify genotypic clusters within and across both provinces, allowing for an improved understanding of genotype data and providing context to more accurately identify clusters representing local transmission. Design We compared 24-locus Mycobacterial Interspersed Repetitive Units-Variable Number of Tandem Repeats (MIRU-VNTR) genotyping for 3,314 Ontario and 1,602 BC clinical Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates collected from 2008 through 2014. Laboratory data for each isolate was linked to case-level records to obtain clinical and demographic data. Results The demographic characteristics of persons with TB varied between provinces, most notably in the proportion of persons born outside Canada, which was reflected in the large number of unique genotypes (n = 3,461). The proportion of clustered isolates was significantly higher in BC. Substantial clustering amongst non-Lineage 4 TB strains was observed within and across the provinces. Only two large clusters (≥10 cases/cluster) representing within province transmission had interprovincial genotype matches. Conclusion We recommend expanding analysis of shared genotypes to include neighbouring jurisdictions, and implementing whole genome sequencing to improve identification of TB transmission, recognize outbreaks, and monitor changing trends in TB epidemiology."
https://openalex.org/W2928178617,"The cloud-based media streaming service is a promising paradigm for multimedia applications. It is attractive to media streaming service providers, who wish to deploy their media server clusters in a media cloud at reduced cost. Since the real-time live streaming service is both a bandwidth-intensive and quality-sensitive application, how to optimize the internal bandwidth utilization of a data center network (DCN) as well as guarantee the external bandwidth of the real-time live streaming application, is a key issue of deploying virtual machine (VM)-hosted media server cluster in a media cloud. Therefore, in this study, we propose an external-bandwidth-guaranteed media server cluster deployment scheme in media cloud. The approach simultaneously considers the outside bandwidth requirement of a tree-based media server cluster for live streaming and the intra-bandwidth consumption of a DCN. The proposed scheme models the optimal problem as a new terminal-Steiner-tree-like problem and provides an approximate algorithm for placing the media servers. Our evaluation results show that the proposed scheme guarantees the external bandwidth requirement of a real-time live streaming application, at the same time, greatly reduces the intra-bandwidth utilization of a media cloud with different DCN structures."
https://openalex.org/W2963238972,"It is crucial for large-scale communication networks such as the internet to be resilient against attacks such as censorship and surveillance, which pose a threat to free expression and free association. Self-organized networks such as the internet’s router network typically have heavy-tailed degree distributions, making them highly vulnerable to targeted attacks against central nodes. While cryptographic solutions exist, they fail to address the underlying topological problem, and remain vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks and coercion. Coercion-resistant, topological approaches to attack tolerance are needed to address the current vulnerability of communications infrastructure to censorship and surveillance. We present a novel concurrent multipath routing (CMR) algorithm for the wraparound butterfly network topology, as well as a highly attack-tolerant Structured Multipath Fault Tolerance (SMFT) architecture which incorporates the butterfly CMR algorithm. We also identify a previously unexplored relationship between network topology, trust transitivity, and attack-tolerance, and provide a framework for further exploration of this relationship. Our work is the first theoretical demonstration of a point-to-point communication network architecture that can resist coercion and other non-technical attacks, without requiring infinitely transitive trust. To address cases where the network structure cannot be fully controlled, we demonstrate how a snapshot of the internet’s router network can be partially rewired for greater attack-tolerance. More broadly, we hope that this work will serve as a starting point for the evelopment of additional topology-based attack-tolerant communication architectures to guard against the dangers of censorship and surveillance."
https://openalex.org/W2928852010,"In South Africa, 600-700 new cases of paediatric cancers have been reported every year for the past 25 years, and in the year 2000, HIV/AIDS was responsible for 42,479 deaths in children under five. These children need intermediate care but research in the field is lacking, with the few costing studies conducted in South Africa reporting a range of inpatient day costs.A retrospective cost analysis for the period April 2014-March 2015 was undertaken from the provider perspective in the public sector, using a step down costing approach. Costs of paediatric intermediate care were estimated for an intermediate care facility (ICF) and a tertiary hospital in Cape Town. Costs were inflated to 2016 prices and reported in US dollars.Cost per inpatient day was $713.09 at the hospital and $695.17 at the ICF for any child requiring care at these institutions. The cost for a paediatric patient who is HIV/TB co-infected was $7 130.94 and $6 951.67 at the hospital and ICF respectively, assuming an average length of stay of 10 days. For a patient with terminal brain carcinoma the cost was $19 966.63 and $19 464.69 at the hospital and ICF respectively, assuming an average length of stay of 28 days. Personnel costs accounted for 60% and 17% of the total cost at the hospital and ICF respectively. Overhead costs accounted for 12.33% at the ICF and 4.48% at the hospital.The drivers of cost are not uniform across settings. Providing intermediate care at an ICF could be less costly than providing this care at a hospital, however more in-depth analysis is needed. The costs presented in this study were considerably higher than those found in other studies, however, the paucity of cost data available in this area makes comparisons difficult."
https://openalex.org/W2929358940,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a muscular condition that leads to muscle loss. Orthotic devices may present a solution for people with DMD to perform activities of daily living (ADL). One such device is the active trunk support but it needs a control interface to identify the user’s intention. Myoelectric control interfaces can be used to detect the user’s intention and consequently control an active trunk support. Current research on the control of orthotic devices that use surface electromyography (sEMG) signals as control inputs, focuses mainly on muscles that are directly linked to the movement being performed (intuitive control). However in some cases, it is hard to detect a proper sEMG signal (e.g., when there is significant amount of fat), which can result in poor control performance. A way to overcome this problem might be the introduction of other, non-intuitive forms of control. This paper presents an explorative study on the comparison and learning behavior of two different control interfaces, one using sEMG of trunk muscles (intuitive) and one using sEMG of leg muscles that can be potentially used for an active trunk support (non-intuitive). Six healthy subjects undertook a 2-D Fitts’s law style task. They were asked to steer a cursor into targets that were radially distributed symmetrically in five directions. The results show that the subjects were generally able to learn to control the tasks using either of the control interfaces and improve their performance over time. Comparison of both control interfaces demonstrated that the subjects were able to learn the leg control interface task faster than the trunk control interface task. Moreover, the performance on the diagonal-targets was significantly lower compared to the one directional-targets for both control interfaces. Overall, the results show that the subjects were able to control a non-intuitive control interface with high performance. Moreover, the results indicate that the non-intuitive control may be a viable solution for controlling an active trunk support."
https://openalex.org/W2932649401,"Background International comparisons of trajectories of depressive symptoms in older adults are scarce and longitudinal associations with co-morbid conditions not fully understood. Objective To compare trajectories of depressive symptoms from participants living in 10 European Countries and identify ages at which the associations of co-morbid conditions with these trajectories become more relevant. Methods Latent growth curve models were fitted to depressive symptoms scores from participants of the Survey of Health and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) initiative (combined n = 21,253) and co-morbid conditions modelled as time varying covariates. To identify the ages at which the association between co-morbid conditions and depressive symptoms was significant the Johnson-Neyman (JN) technique was used. Results The shape of depressive symptoms trajectories varied between countries, and was highly dependent on modelling decisions. The association between the average number of co-morbidities reported over time and depressive symptoms was consistent and positive across countries and ages. Conclusion International differences in ageing-related trajectories of depressive symptoms emerged. The longitudinal association of co-morbid conditions with trajectories of depressive symptoms was found, but the results overall suggest that modelling decisions could greatly influence the outcomes, and should thus be interpreted with caution."

https://openalex.org/W2934634662,"Whether the cardiovascular (CV) outcomes of second-generation limus-eluting stents (LESs) differ from those of paclitaxel-eluting stents (PESs) in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) complicated by cardiogenic shock (CS) is still unclear.We used the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database to analyse data of 516 patients with AMI and CS diagnosed from January 2007 to December 2011. We used propensity score matching to adjust for the imbalance in covariate baseline values between these two groups. We evaluated clinical outcomes by comparing 197 subjects who used second-generation LESs to 319 matched subjects who used PESs.The risk of the primary composite outcomes (i.e., myocardial infarction, coronary revascularisation or CV death) was significantly lower in the second-generation LES group than in the PES group [37.3% vs. 51.8%; hazard ratio (HR), 0.73; 95% CI: 0.56-0.95] at the 12-month follow-up. The patients who received second-generation LESs had a lower risk of coronary revascularisation (HR 0.62; 95% CI: 0.41-0.93) than those who used PESs. However, the risks of myocardial infarction (HR 0.56; 95% CI: 0.26-1.24), ischemic stroke (HR 0.73; 95% CI: 0.23-2.35), or CV death (HR 0.90; 95% CI: 0.63-1.28) were not significantly different between the two groups.Among patients with CS-complicating AMI, second-generation LES implantation significantly reduced the risk of coronary revascularisation and composite CV events compared to PES implantation at the 12-month follow-up."
