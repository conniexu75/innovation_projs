https://openalex.org/W1488424161,"The complete amino acid sequence of human insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), a polypeptide isolated from serum, has been determined. IGF-I is a single chain polypeptide of 70 amino acid residues cross-linked by three disulfide bridges. The calculated molecular weight is 7649. IGF-I displays obvious homology to proinsulin: positions 1 to 29 are homologous to insulin B chain and positions 42 to 62 to insulin A chain. A shortened connecting peptide with 12 residues (positions 30 to 41) compared to 30 to 35 in proinsulins shows no homology to proinsulin C peptide. An octapeptide sequence at the COOH-terminal end is also a feature not found in proinsulins. The number of differences in amino acid positions between IGF-I and insulins suggests that duplication of the gene of the common ancestor of proinsulin and IGF occurred before the time of appearance of the vertebrates. Of the 19 residues known to be invariant in all insulins so far sequenced, only glutamine A5 and asparagine A21 are replaced in IGF-I by glutamic acid and alanine, respectively. The fact that all half-cystine and glycine residues and most nonpolar core residues of the insulin monomer are conserved is compatible with a three-dimensional structure of IGF-I similar to that of insulin."
https://openalex.org/W1811094195,MCF-7 cells of human breast cancer origin responded to estradiol (E) treatment with increased levels of progesterone receptor (PgR) showing that human breast cells which have undergone malignant changes can continue to synthesize a specific protein under hormone control. These results were obtained by studying the effects of addition and withdrawal of E on PgR synthesis and correlating this with estrogen receptor (ER) binding translocation nuclear processing reactions and restoration of unoccupied ER. In cells treated 1-5 days with E (.001-100 nM) basal PgR levels (.3-.7 pmol/mg of deoxyribonucleic acid) increased 3-6 fold. PgR response was dose-dependent with .1 nM E (a physiologic dose) the maximal effective dose. Growth and induction of PgR by .1 nM E was suppressed by an antiestrogen Tamoxifen at 10000-fold molar excess (1 mcgM) but was reversed by supraphysiological E (10 nM) which reduced the molar excess of Tamoxifen to only 100-fold. In this cell line ER unoccupied by hormone was not restricted to the cytoplasm (Rc) since a portion of the cellular receptor can also be found in the nucleus in unoccupied form (RN). The level of PgR induction correlated with the extent of Rc binding and translocation and also with the extent of Rn binding. At .1 nM E 85% of Rc and Rn were depleted and PgR was maximally stimulated. The levels of PgR also paralleled processing of bound ER (RnE) appearing in the nucleus. Processing during which a new steady-state level of RnE was achieved appeared to be a saturable event. At low E doses despite Rc and Rn binding of E RnE failed to accumulate and total ER decreased. The loss approached 70% at .1 nM E. But at higher E doses some nuclear receptor remained unprocessed and RnE levels increased. The processing effect was rapid beginning within 10 minutes of E addition and completed by 5 hours. Processed RnE levels were seen before PgR induction and during maintenance of induced PgR states. In estrogen withdrawn cells PgR fell in parallel with end of processing and restoration of Rc and Rn.

https://openalex.org/W1597669330,"NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase was isolated from liver microsomes of phenobarbital-induced rats. The enzyme exhibits an apparent minimal molecular weight of 76,000 as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and contains 1 molecule each of FMN and FAD. Trypsin treatment of the reductase yields an enzyme with an apparent minimal molecular weight of 69,000 which retains the ability to reduce cytochrome c but has no activity toward cytochrome P-450. Various spectrophotometric titrations were performed to examine the electron-accepting properties of the purified NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase and, in particular, to determine the oxidation state of the stable semiquinone form produced by air oxidation of NADPH-reduced enzyme. Titration of the air-stable semiquinone form of the reductase with ferricyanide indicated that 1 mol/2 mol of flavin was required for complete oxidation. Furthermore, a spectrum corresponding to that of the air-stable semiquinone form was produced by the addition of approximately 0.5 mol of reductant/2 mol of flavin when the oxidized enzyme was titrate with NADPH or dithionite under anaerobic conditions. The spectral changes which accompanied the overall reduction of oxidized enzyme to the reduced form with dithionite produced four sets of isosbestic points, and the spectrophotometric titration curve consisted of four approximately equal phases. In the titration with NADPH, no significant further reduction was observed after the addition of approximately 1.5 mol/2 mol of flavin. However, the enzyme was fully reduced by NADPH when an NAPH-generating system was used to prevent the accumulation of NADP. Our results establish that the air-stable semiquinone form is a 1-electron-reduced form, rather than a half-reduced (2-electron-reduced) form as maintained by others and are in agreement with earlier studies (Iyanagi, T., Makino, N., and Mason, H.S. (1974) Biochemistry 13, 1701-1710) with the purified trypsin-solubilized reductase. Accordingly, the air-stable species represents a form of the NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase in which one of the two flavins exists in the semiquinone state and the other in the oxidized state."

https://openalex.org/W1489487899,"Total poly(A)-containing RNA prepared from hen oviduct and centrifuged on an isokinetic sucrose gradient displays four peaks of optical absorbance. These have been identified by translation in vitro as lysozyme, ovomucoid, ovalbumin, and conalbumin mRNAs. Isolation and recentrifugation of the peaks results in partial purification of each mRNA. Molecular weights have been determined for the mRNAs on agarose gels containing 20 mM methylmercury hydroxide. Each mRNA possesses a number of apparently untranslated nucleotides ranging from approximately 900 bases for ovalbumin and conalbumin mRNAs to 200 bases for ovomucoid and lysozyme mRNAs. The mRNAs have been copied with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase. Each mRNA with the exception of conalbumin gives rise to a high proportion of full length cDNA. Several parameters previously reported to influence the size distribution of cDNA had no effect on the length of cDNA made from any mRNA fraction. The proportion of full length copy does depend on the reverse transcriptase lot."

https://openalex.org/W1548659851,"All five urea cycle enzymes of rat liver increased in activity 48 h after subcutaneous administration of crystalline zinc glucagon to male rats and remained elevated after 7 days of continuous glucagon infusion. The maximum ratios of enzyme activities over those of controls were 2.0 for carbamyl phosphate synthetase, 1.3 for ornithine transcarbamylase, 2.7 for argininosuccinate synthetase, 3.2 for argininosuccinase, and 2.2 for arginase. Actinomycin D or puromycin prevented these responses to glucagon. The increase in arginase activity after zinc glucagon treatment was matched by an increase in immunoprecipitable enzyme. All five enzymes were induced by physiological plasma levels of glucagon. Tube feeding of casein hydrolysate for 2 days increased all five enzyme activities 1.5- to 2.2-fold and resulted in plasma glucagon levels similar to those required for induction by exogenous glucagon. Thus, glucagon is an inducer of the entire urea cycle in rat liver and plays a role in the induction of the cycle by protein feeding."

https://openalex.org/W1505428665,"Human hemolysate contains several minor components designated Hb A1a, Hb A1b, Hb A1c, which are post-translational modifications of the major hemoglobin component A0. Individuals with diabetes mellitus have elevated levels of Hb A1c, a hemoglobin modified with a glucose moiety at the NH2 terminus of each beta chain. A new chromatographic technique using Bio-Rex 70 is described which not only allows complete separation of Hb A1a from Hb A1b but also resolution of Hb A1a into two components, designated Hb A1a1 and Hb A1a2. Carbohydrate determinations with the thiobarbituric acid procedure revealed that Hb A1a1, Hb A1a2, and Hb A1b as well as Hb A1c were glycosylated. Total phosphate analysis revealed 2.06 and 1.01 mol of phosphorus/alphabeta dimer for Hb A1a1 and Hb A1a2 respectively; Hb A1b and Hb A1c contained no detectable phosphate. Hemoglobin incubated with D-[14C]glucose-6-P co-chromatographs precisely with Hb A1a2, strongly suggesting that Hb A1a2 is glucose-6-P hemoglobin. Levels of Hb A1a1 and Hb A1a2 are normal in individuals with diabetes mellitus. Furthermore, diabetic red cells contain normal levels of glucose-6-P. Therefore, glucose-6-P hemoglobin does not serve as a significant precursor to Hb A1c. Instead Hb A1c is formed by the direct reaction of hemoglobin with glucose. This suggests that hemoglobin can serve as a model system for nonenzymatic glycosylation of protein."
https://openalex.org/W1514706775,"Apolipoproteins synthesized by intestine were identified in mesenteric lymph and plasma collected from an animal preparation in which exposure to [3H]leucine was restricted to the mucosal epithelial cells of a fat-transporting small intestinal segment in situ. The intestine released labeled chylomicrons and very low density lipoproteins only into lymph but labeled high density lipoproteins into both plasma and lymph. Of the 3H incorporated into individual apolipoproteins, separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, 25% was recovered in apolipoprotein B (apoB), 50% in apoA-I, 21% in apoA-IV, and 4% in C apolipoproteins, nearly all in apoC-II and apoC-III-0. Only traces of radioactivity were associated with the arginine-rich protein and none was detected in apoA-II. Labeled apoB was found in chylomicrons and very low density lipoproteins and labeled apoA-I and apoA-IV in all lipoproteins. Evidence suggested that substantial amounts of labeled apoA-IV were also present in the lipoprotein-free lymph fraction (d greater than 1.21 g/ml), further indicating that apoA-IV is a major apolipoprotein product in intestine. Thus, the pattern of apolipoprotein synthesis by intestine is notably different from that reported for liver."

https://openalex.org/W1635738393,"The peptide hormone, prolactin, when added to organ explants of rat mammary gland, rapidly (within 1 h) induced the accumulation of casein mRNA. Casein mRNA sequences, as determined by hybridization with a specific cDNA probe, were shown to increase for up to 48 h after prolactin addition. The magnitude of this response was dependent upon the day of pregnancy at which the tissue was placed in culture. Maximal levels of induction (as great as 45-fold) were obtained using tissue from 15-day pregnant rats. Further data indicate that two steroid hormones, hydrocortisone and progesterone, were able to modulate the prolactin-induced accumulation of casein mRNA. The continuous presence of hydrocortisone was not necessary for prolactin induction of casein mRNA. However, the presence of hydrocortisone was required for maximal accumulation of casein mRNA. The induction of casein mRNA by prolactin was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by the simultaneous addition of progesterone to the organ culture. Thus, hydrocortisone appears to potentiate the prolactin induction of casein mRNA, whereas progesterone is able to prevent casein mRNA accumulation. Since mammary gland organ culture is performed in a serum-free, chemically defined medium, this system allows a detailed examination of the mechanims by which a peptide hormone regulates the rapid accumulation of a specific mRNA."

https://openalex.org/W1493421833,"We have measured rates of ketogenesis and malonyl-CoA contents of hepatocytes isolated from meal-fed rats under a variety of incubation conditions in order to determine the relationship between the intracellular malonyl-CoA level and the rate of ketogenesis. Evidence obtained from rat liver homogenates suggested that malonyl-CoA, which is a major determinant of fatty acid synthesis in vivo, also inhibits carnitine acyltransferase I (EC 2.3.1.21) and thereby decreases the rate of ketogenesis (McGarry, J.D., Mannaerts, G.P., and Foster, D.W. (1977) J. Clin. Invest. 60, 265-270). In hepatocytes from meal-fed rats, malonyl-CoA could be increased by glucose or lactate plus pyruvate and decreased by glucagon, oleic acid and the fatty acid synthesis inhibitor 5-(tetradecyloxy)-2-furoic acid. Malonyl-CoA varied from 14.8 +/- 1.2 to 1.4 +/- 0.1 nmol/g wet weight of cells. Rates of ketone body production varied from 0.10 +/- 0.01 to 0.96 +/- 0.06 mumol/min/g wet weight of cells and varied inversely with the malonyl-CoA content. Dixon plots and Cornish-Bowden plots of data suggest that malonyl-CoA is a competitive inhibitor of ketogenesis with a Ki of 2 nmol/g wet weight of cells. We conclude that in hepatocytes from meal-fed rats the cellular content of malonyl-CoA and the concentration of long chain fatty acid available to the cells are major determinants of the rate of ketogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W1593615758,"A variety of compounds related to the 5'-terminal (m7GpppN) of eukaryotic mRNA's were chemically synthesized and tested as inhibitors of reovirus mRNA binding to wheat germ ribosomes. Under our conditions of mRNA binding to ribosomes, 7-methyl-, 7-ethyl-, and 7-benzyl-GDP, but not GDP, decreased stable initiation complex formation by 70 to 80% at a concentration of 0.1 mM indicating that 7-substitution, but not a specific substituent, was required for the effect. Elimination of the positive charge on the imidazole of the 7-substituted compounds by treatment with alkali destroyed their inhibitory activity. Similarly, reduction to 8-hydro-m7GDP reversibly decreased the activity of m7GDP. The results were consistent with the hypothesis that the positive charge resulting from 7-alkylation provides an active cap conformer for binding via interaction of phosphate oxygens with the positively charged imidazole moiety. In accord with this suggestion, 7-carboxymethyl GDP and 7,8-dimethyl GDP were found to be less inhibitory than m7GDP. A 2-amino group was also important since m7IDP was less effective than m7GDP and 0.1 mM m7XDP did not inhibit ribosome binding. Other poor inhibitors were 6-Cl-m7GDP and 1,7-dimethyl GDP but N2,7-dimethyl GDP, 2'-deoxy-m7GDP, and m7GppI had essentially the same activity as m7GDP."

https://openalex.org/W1641310924,"Abstract Alterations in the structure of the DNA-binding protein specified by gene 32 of bacteriophage T4 have been detected using partial trypsin digestion as a conformational probe. Limited tryptic hydrolysis of the gene 32 protein removes a fragment (B region), of 21 amino acids from the NH2 terminus and a 6,200-dalton fragment (A region) from the COOH terminus. Poly(dT), poly(dC), and single-stranded DNA increase the rate of tryptic hydrolysis of the region but decrease the rate of tryptic hydrolysis of the B region. Oligonucleotides, which are too short to permit cooperative binding of the gene 32 protein, do not alter the rate of tryptic hydrolysis of either the or B regions. A model which accounts for these findings requires that the B region be involved in gene 32 protein:gene 32 protein interactions when the gene 32 protein: DNA complex is formed. As a consequence of the gene 32 protein:DNA interaction, the region should be able to participate more effectively in vivo and in vitro with other proteins involved in T4 DNA metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1570887094,"Whole homogenates prepared from tissue previously exposed to epinephrine displayed a 3-fold increased rate of lipolysis of endogenous substrate. When the aqueous infranatant phase of such homogenates was collected by centrifugation and assayed against exogenous triolein emulsions, no hormone effect could be demonstrated. Treatment of such infranatants with cAMP-dependent protein kinase prepared from muscle increased their lipase activity against exogenous triolein by 80%. Employing [3H]triolein emulsions as exogenous substrate, rates of lipolysis of both endogenous and exogenous glycerides were measured simultaneously in whole tissue homogenates. Prior treatment of the tissue with epinephrine increased the rate of lipolysis of endogenous glycerides an average of 3-fold but had no effect on the hydrolysis of exogenous triolein. By contrast, treatment of whole homogenates with protein kinase accelerated lipolysis of exogenous triolein without altering the rate of hydrolysis of endogenous glycerides. The data suggest that a second pathway of lipolysis activation occurs in response to epinephrine in addition to that involving a cAMP-mediated increase in the state of phosphorylation of the hormone-sensitive lipase."

https://openalex.org/W1592634411,"Abstract Bacterial trimethylamine dehydrogenase contains a covalently bound yellow coenzyme, the properties of which distinguish it from all known riboflavin, pyridoxine, and pteridine derivatives. A pure dodecapeptide containing the covalently linked coenzyme has been isolated from tryptic-chymotryptic digests. Treatment with aminopeptidase M converts it to a ninhydrin-positive aminoacyl coenzyme, which has also been isolated in chromatographically pure form. The coenzyme as isolated is virtually nonfluorescent but, being extremely photolabile, it is rapidly converted on illumination to products, the predominant one being highly fluorescent. Analysis for phosphate and the influence of phosphatase treatment on electrophoretic mobility show that the coenzyme is isolated as a monophosphate, while periodate titrations prove the presence of a pentityl side chain, to which the phosphate is attached. Oxidation of the aminoacyl coenzyme with performic acid, followed by acid hydrolysis, yields 2',5'-anhydroriboflavin and some free riboflavin, products also obtained on similar treatment of FMN. These observations and the very tight binding to apoflavodoxin show that the coenzyme is a flavin derivative. The absorption and NMR spectra, however, clearly set it apart from 8alpha-substituted flavins and suggest that the coenzyme is the first representative of a new class of covalently bound flavins."
https://openalex.org/W1577750569,"The regulation of intestinal cholesterol synthesis was studied utilizing canine ileal mucosa maintained in organ culture for 6 h. Viability was monitored by light and electron microscopy, measurement of cellular enzymes, and the ability to actively transport a glucose analogue. The activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase (EC 1.1.4.3.4), the rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol synthesis, increased 4-fold during a 6-h culture. A parallel increase occurred in the rate of acetate incorporation into digitonin-precipitable sterols during this period. This increase could be prevented by the addition of cycloheximide to the culture. Pure cholesterol, 7-ketocholesterol, and 25-hydroxycholesterol, when present during the last 4 h of culture, also caused significant suppression of the rise in HMG-CoA reductase activity (final HMG-CoA reductase with the three sterols was 77 +/- 4%, 68 +/- 5%, and 58 +/- 3% of control postculture value). Bile salts at low, nontoxic concentrations also inhibited the increase of enzyme activity (2 mM taurocholate = 63 +/- 3% of control, 0.5 mM taurochenodeoxycholate = 76 +/- 6% of control). In contrast, dog lipoproteins separated by ultracentrifugation failed to significantly affect intestinal cholesterol synthesis in these short term organ cultures."

Quantitative Quantitative determination of pantetheine, of flavin, and of the number of fatty acids synthesized during a single enzyme turnover all yield values corresponding to a stoichiometry of about 1 mol per mol of subunit, providing strong evidence that M. smegmatis fatty acid synthetase is an oligomer of identical, multifunctional polypeptide chains."

https://openalex.org/W1572590310,"Proteins solubilized from the chemically transformed, highly tumorigenic Syrian hamster cell line, BP6T, and the untransformed parental embryo cells, have been analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Differences in seven major polypeptides have been identified in cytoplasmic and nuclear cell fractions from these two related cell types. The tumorigenic cells have lost the ability to synthesize detectable amounts of five major polypeptides which are found in untransformed cells; in addition, the tumorigenic cells synthesize two new major polypeptide species not found in the untransformed cells. Butyric acid, an agent which suppresses in vitro cellular properties frequently associated with neoplasia, induces in a reversible fashion synthesis of two of these missing polypeptide species in the tumorigenic cells. The results indicate that a change in the synthesis of less than 1% of the major polypeptide species is associated with a chemical mediated induction of the high tumorigenic state of Syrian hamster cells."

The radioactive fatty acid synthetase protein synthesized in the oocytes was identified by immunoprecipitation with anti-fatty acid synthetase antibody and the immunoprecipitate was then characterized by electrophoresis on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel. Co-migration of authentic fatty acid synthetase and the labeled product synthesized in oocytes was observed. Based on sucrose density gradient analysis, the rat liver fatty acid synthetase mRNA has a sedimentation coefficient of approximately 33 S, which agrees with the predicted minimum size necessary to code for the fatty acid synthetase protein. In addition, this mRNA was partially purified with oligo(dT)-cellulose, which indicates that it has a polyadenylate region. The relative in vivo rate of synthesis of fatty acid synthetase and the level of fatty acid synthetase mRNA in liver were also determined during the course of dietary induction of this enzyme. The results indicate that the dietary-induced increase in the level of fatty acid synthetase is probably due to an increased level of the fatty acid synthetase mRNA."

Reaction occurs rapidly in aqueous solution, and no protecting groups are required, simplifying recovery and purification of the products. The concentrations of sodium chloride and manganous chloride in the incubation mixture are critical to obtaining good yield of the required product. Primers of chain length from 3 to 12 have been extended by up to 9 deoxyribonucleotide residues to obtain oligodeoxyribonucleotides of chain length up to 13. Yields of single addition products varied from 8 to 59%. Factors which influence these yields are discussed. The effects of added polyamines and some organic solvents on the reaction are described.

Sedimentation velocity experiments showed that the differences in optical activity are not due to a different state of aggregation of the subunits. Modification of the tertiary structure of the beta subunits seems to be responsible for the phenomenon. Speculation based on the work of Hsu and Woody (Hsu, M.C., and Woody, R.W. (1971) J. Am. Chem.

https://openalex.org/W1483991484,"Abstract The synthesis of N-(2,4-diphosphobenzyl)-1-amino-5-naphthalenesulfonic acid (DIPANS) is described. It entails the synthesis of 2,4-diphosphobenzaldehyde from the action of POCl3 on 2,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde. This is followed by coupling of the 2,4-diphosphobenzaldehyde to 1-amino-5-naphthalenesulfonic acid. Subsequent reduction with NaBH4 yields the desired product. The DIPANS exhibits an excitation maximum at 337 nm and a fluorescence emission maximum at 504 nm. This dye is quantitatively displaced by inositol hexaphosphate and is an effective analogus of diphosphoglyceric acid (DPG), possessing a KD at pH 7.0 in 0.05 M [bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]tris(hydroxymethyl)methane (bis-Tris) plus 0.1 M chloride of 6.88 microgram, with 1.0 molecule bound/hemoglobin tetramer. Like DPG its binding to deoxyhemoglobin decreases with increasing pH; in the presence of 0.1 M chloride it binds 0.031 times as tightly to CO hemoglobin and it yields a value for free energy coupling of 2.0 kcal/mol. The presence of 1 mM DIPANS decreases the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen in the absence of salt from p1/2 of 0.8 mm Hg to 12.4 mm Hg. Using DPG as a competitor of DIPANS binding, a dissociation constant of 11.4 micrometer was calculated for DPG binding to deoxy-Hb at pH 7.0 in the presence of 0.05 M bis-Tris and 0.1 M chloride."

Poly(A) synthetase activity co-purifies with both holoenzyme and core polymerase on DNA-cellulose columns, and core polymerase purified to 98% homogeneity by glycerol gradient centrifugation is still capable of catalyzing poly(A) polymerization. Both RNA synthesis and poly(A) polymerization activities are sensitive to rifampicin. In addition, RNA polymerase purified from partially rifampicin-sensitive mutants exhibits the same partial sensitivity in vitro to the drug in the synthesis of RNA and poly(A). The enzyme used in these studies was prepared by a simple method which allows a high yield of pure RNA polymerase from large batches of exponential cells. The procedure includes high speed centrifugation of cell extracts, DEAE-cellulose column, DNA-affinity chromatography, and low salt glycerol gradient centrifugation. Holoenzyme can be resolved into core and sigma subunit by either DNA-cellulose chromatography or glycerol gradient centrifugation, and the latter step allows recovery of pure sigma factor."
