https://openalex.org/W1985342263,"With the overexploitation of many conventional fish stcocks, and growing interest in harvesting new kinds of food from the sea, there is increasing need for managers of fisheries to take account of interactions among species. In particular, as Antarctic krill-fishing industries grow, there is a need to agree upon sound principles for managing the Southern Ocean ecosystem. Using simple models, we discuss the way multispecies food webs respond to the harvesting of species at differrent trophic levels. These biological and economic insights are applied to a discussion of fisheries in the Southern Otean and the North Sea and to enunciate some for harvesting in multispecies systems."

A rapid qualitative field test assists in locating past settlements and determining their areal and temporal extent, even where artifacts are missing. The field-test results are verified and samples are analyzed further by quantitative soil phosphate fractionation. Laboratory fractionation reveals much more than the simple phosphate test used at present. Like the chemical field test, it uses minute soil samples and may be invaluable where disturbance of the landscape is forbidden. Phosphate fractions reflect the details of man-induced changes in the soil and the timing of their appearance."

Ovarian development which is dependent upon juvenile hormone is prevented or reversed, depending upon the timing of precocene treatment. Juvenile hormone secretion is shown to be related to the development of the corpus allatum."
https://openalex.org/W2001284490,The origins of the domestic dog are discussed in relation to the hunting and nurturing behavioral patterns of man and the social canids. While it is accepted that the wolf was the progenitor of the dog the possibility that other species of canid were tamed and interbred with early domestic dogs is not disputed. A description is given of the recently extinct Dusicyon australis and it is suggested that this South American canid may have been tamed and then introduced and domesticated by man in the Falkland Islands during the early Holocene.
https://openalex.org/W1983104581,"In recent years archeologists have become interested in the extent to which prehistoric peoples heat-treated chert prior to shaping it into tools. Thermoluminescent determination of the radiation dose accumulated by an artifact since it was formed or last heated provides a simple, reliable test for such heat treatment. This test can be applied to single artifacts without the need for raw source material for comparison. Results on 25 artifacts from four sites indicate that, for many chert sources, color and luster are not useful indicators of heat treatment by prehistoric peoples."

In other places considered to be among the cleanest in the world, such as Hawaii, Samoa, Greenland, and Antarctica, apparent excesses of heavy metals, sulfate, and acidity remain to be fully explained. Some of these may in fact be natural, perhaps resulting from volcanic emissions, for example, but the environmental effects, if any, of true pollutants will have to be evaluated. That analysis will undoubtedly be even more complex than unraveling their chemistry."
https://openalex.org/W2030543196,"Cell cultures of crop plants provide new opportunities to recover induced mutations likely to increase crop yield. Approaches include regulating respiration to conserve carbon fixed by photosynthesis, and increasing the nutritive value of seed protein. They depend on devising selecting conditions which only desired mutant cells can survive. Protoplast fusion offers some promise of tapping sources of genetic variation now unavailable because of sterility barriers between species and genera. Difficulties in regenerating cell lines from protoplasts, and plants from cells, still hamper progress but are becoming less severe. Recombinant DNA techniques may allow detection and selection of bacterial cell lines carrying specific DNA sequences. Isolation and amplification of crop plant genes could then lead to ways of transforming plants that will be useful to breeders."

The presence of these forms suggests conditions in favor of an invasion of the land. Various arthropod adaptations to terrestrial life are present, including the development of a preoral cavity."

Others deny that the Sozudai objects are artifacts. With separate test procedures, flakes in the Sozudai assemblage were identified and compared to the standard developed by A. S. Barnes. These procedures indicate that flakes in the Sozudai assemblage are of human origin."
https://openalex.org/W2049817386,"Diethylhydroxylamine (DEHA) reacts with gas-phase hydroxyl radicals on every third collision, whereas the corresponding reaction in aqueous solution is considerably slower. The high gas-phase reactivity explains the predicted inhibitory effect of DEHA in atmospheric smog processes. Results from the studies in the aqueous phase are helpful in predicting the mechanism of the reaction of DEHA with hydroxyl radicals."

https://openalex.org/W2028116483,A method has been developed to measure temperature exposure based on the use of the temperature-dependent property of thermoluminescence fade. This property provides a relatively simple and inexpensive method for measuring both average and accumulated temperature exposure without the need for sophisticated temperature-recording equipment.

The probable stations of the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism are (1) La Paz, Bolivia; (2) Huancayo (north of belt of totality); (3) near Sobral, Brazil; (4) Ile Principe or Libreville, French Congo; and (5) various field stations within the zone of visibility. At station (3) complete magnetic and electric observations will be made."

https://openalex.org/W4248595646,"In the Research News article ""Tournament competition fuels computer chess"" (29 June, p. 1396), the figure was reprodeced incorrectly. Black has a third pawn on the black square immediately in front of the black king. The figure and its legend are reproduced herewith. One limitation offull-width search methods in computer chess is called the horizon effect. A human easily sees that white, although it has one less pawn, can win the game by advancing its leftmost pawn across the board, whereupon it is promoted, by the rules of chess, to a queen. The computer, if it does not search enough moves into the future, will not see this outcome and will be excessively concerned about black's apparent material advantage.
