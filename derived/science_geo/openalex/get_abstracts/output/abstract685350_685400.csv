https://openalex.org/W4200345742,"The targeted deletion, replacement, integration or inversion of genomic sequences could be used to study or treat human genetic diseases, but existing methods typically require double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) that lead to undesired consequences, including uncontrolled indel mixtures and chromosomal abnormalities. Here we describe twin prime editing (twinPE), a DSB-independent method that uses a prime editor protein and two prime editing guide RNAs (pegRNAs) for the programmable replacement or excision of DNA sequences at endogenous human genomic sites. The two pegRNAs template the synthesis of complementary DNA flaps on opposing strands of genomic DNA, which replace the endogenous DNA sequence between the prime-editor-induced nick sites. When combined with a site-specific serine recombinase, twinPE enabled targeted integration of gene-sized DNA plasmids (>5,000 bp) and targeted sequence inversions of 40 kb in human cells. TwinPE expands the capabilities of precision gene editing and might synergize with other tools for the correction or complementation of large or complex human pathogenic alleles. Prime editing of large DNA sequences is achieved with two pegRNAs and site-specific recombinases."
https://openalex.org/W4200254733,"Extracellular vesicles and exomere nanoparticles are under intense investigation as sources of clinically relevant cargo. Here we report the discovery of a distinct extracellular nanoparticle, termed supermere. Supermeres are morphologically distinct from exomeres and display a markedly greater uptake in vivo compared with small extracellular vesicles and exomeres. The protein and RNA composition of supermeres differs from small extracellular vesicles and exomeres. Supermeres are highly enriched with cargo involved in multiple cancers (glycolytic enzymes, TGFBI, miR-1246, MET, GPC1 and AGO2), Alzheimer's disease (APP) and cardiovascular disease (ACE2, ACE and PCSK9). The majority of extracellular RNA is associated with supermeres rather than small extracellular vesicles and exomeres. Cancer-derived supermeres increase lactate secretion, transfer cetuximab resistance and decrease hepatic lipids and glycogen in vivo. This study identifies a distinct functional nanoparticle replete with potential circulating biomarkers and therapeutic targets for a host of human diseases."
https://openalex.org/W4200495164,"Abstract Anti-programmed death (PD)-1 (aPD1) therapy is an effective treatment for metastatic melanoma (MM); however, over 50% of patients progress due to resistance. We tested a first-in-class immune-modulatory vaccine (IO102/IO103) against indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and PD ligand 1 (PD-L1), targeting immunosuppressive cells and tumor cells expressing IDO and/or PD-L1 (IDO/PD-L1), combined with nivolumab. Thirty aPD1 therapy-naive patients with MM were treated in a phase 1/2 study ( https://clinicaltrials.gov/ , NCT03047928). The primary endpoint was feasibility and safety; the systemic toxicity profile was comparable to that of nivolumab monotherapy. Secondary endpoints were efficacy and immunogenicity; an objective response rate (ORR) of 80% (confidence interval (CI), 62.7–90.5%) was reached, with 43% (CI, 27.4–60.8%) complete responses. After a median follow-up of 22.9 months, the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 26 months (CI, 15.4–69 months). Median overall survival (OS) was not reached. Vaccine-specific responses assessed in vitro were detected in the blood of &gt;93% of patients during vaccination. Vaccine-reactive T cells comprised CD4 + and CD8 + T cells with activity against IDO- and PD-L1-expressing cancer and immune cells. T cell influx of peripherally expanded T cells into tumor sites was observed in responding patients, and general enrichment of IDO- and PD-L1-specific clones after treatment was documented. These clinical efficacy and favorable safety data support further validation in a larger randomized trial to confirm the clinical potential of this immunomodulating approach."
https://openalex.org/W4200069835,"The development of a protective vaccine remains a top priority for the control of the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Here, we show that a messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine co-expressing membrane-anchored HIV-1 envelope (Env) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) Gag proteins to generate virus-like particles (VLPs) induces antibodies capable of broad neutralization and reduces the risk of infection in rhesus macaques. In mice, immunization with co-formulated env and gag mRNAs was superior to env mRNA alone in inducing neutralizing antibodies. Macaques were primed with a transmitted-founder clade-B env mRNA lacking the N276 glycan, followed by multiple booster immunizations with glycan-repaired autologous and subsequently bivalent heterologous envs (clades A and C). This regimen was highly immunogenic and elicited neutralizing antibodies against the most prevalent (tier-2) HIV-1 strains accompanied by robust anti-Env CD4+ T cell responses. Vaccinated animals had a 79% per-exposure risk reduction upon repeated low-dose mucosal challenges with heterologous tier-2 simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV AD8). Thus, the multiclade env-gag VLP mRNA platform represents a promising approach for the development of an HIV-1 vaccine."
https://openalex.org/W4200022905,"Introduction Studies related to the COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy are scanty in Bangladesh, despite the growing necessity of understanding the population behavior related to vaccination. Thus, the present study was conducted to assess the prevalence of the COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and its associated factors in Bangladesh to fill the knowledge gap. Methods and materials This study adopted a cross-sectional design to collect data from 1497 respondents using online (Google forms) and face-to-face interviews from eight administrative divisions of Bangladesh between 1–7 February 2021. We employed descriptive statistics and multiple logistic regression analysis. Results The prevalence of vaccine hesitancy was 46.2%. The Muslims (aOR = 1.80, p ≤ 0.01) and the respondents living in the city corporation areas (aOR = 2.14, p ≤0.001) had more hesitancy. There was significant variation in vaccine hesitancy by administrative divisions (geographic regions). Compared to the Sylhet division, the participants from Khulna (aOR = 1.31, p ≤0.001) had higher hesitancy. The vaccine hesitancy tended to decrease with increasing knowledge about the vaccine (aOR = 0.88, p≤0.001) and the vaccination process (aOR = 0.91, p ≤ 0.01). On the other hand, hesitancy increased with the increased negative attitudes towards the vaccine (aOR = 1.17, p≤0.001) and conspiracy beliefs towards the COVID-19 vaccine (aOR = 1.04, p≤0.01). The perceived benefits of COVID-19 vaccination (aOR = 0.85, p≤0.001) were negatively associated with hesitancy, while perceived barriers (aOR = 1.16, p ≤0.001) were positively associated. The participants were more hesitant to accept the vaccine from a specific country of origin (India, USA, Europe). Conclusions Our findings warrant that a vigorous behavior change communication campaign should be designed and implemented to demystify negative public attitudes and conspiracy beliefs regarding the COVID-19 Vaccine in Bangladesh. The policymakers should also think about revisiting the policy of the online registration process to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, as online registration is a key structural barrier for many due to the persistent digital divide in the country. Finally, the government should consider the population’s preference regarding vaccines’ country of manufacture to reduce the COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy."
https://openalex.org/W4200200443,"Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection causes acute disease characterized by fever, rash and arthralgia, which progresses to severe and chronic arthritis in up to 50% of patients. Moreover, CHIKV infection can be fatal in infants or immunocompromised individuals and has no approved therapy or prevention. This phase 1, first-in-human, randomized, placebo-controlled, proof-of-concept trial conducted from January 2019 to June 2020 evaluated the safety and pharmacology of mRNA-1944, a lipid nanoparticle-encapsulated messenger RNA encoding the heavy and light chains of a CHIKV-specific monoclonal neutralizing antibody, CHKV-24 ( NCT03829384 ). The primary outcome was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of mRNA-1944 administered via intravenous infusion in healthy participants aged 18-50 years. The secondary objectives included determination of the pharmacokinetics of mRNA encoding for CHKV-24 immunoglobulin heavy and light chains and ionizable amino lipid component and the pharmacodynamics of mRNA-1944 as assessed by serum concentrations of mRNA encoding for CHKV-24 immunoglobulin G (IgG), plasma concentrations of ionizable amino lipid and serum concentrations of CHKV-24 IgG. Here we report the results of a prespecified interim analysis of 38 healthy participants who received intravenous single doses of mRNA-1944 or placebo at 0.1, 0.3 and 0.6 mg kg-1, or two weekly doses at 0.3 mg kg-1. At 12, 24 and 48 h after single infusions, dose-dependent levels of CHKV-24 IgG with neutralizing activity were observed at titers predicted to be therapeutically relevant concentrations (≥1 µg ml-1) across doses that persisted for ≥16 weeks at 0.3 and 0.6 mg kg-1 (mean t1/2 approximately 69 d). A second 0.3 mg kg-1 dose 1 week after the first increased CHKV-24 IgG levels 1.8-fold. Adverse effects were mild to moderate in severity, did not worsen with a second mRNA-1944 dose and none were serious. To our knowledge, mRNA-1944 is the first mRNA-encoded monoclonal antibody showing in vivo expression and detectable ex vivo neutralizing activity in a clinical trial and may offer a treatment option for CHIKV infection. Further evaluation of the potential therapeutic use of mRNA-1944 in clinical trials for the treatment of CHIKV infection is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W4200465000,"Detection of neural signatures related to pathological behavioral states could enable adaptive deep brain stimulation (DBS), a potential strategy for improving efficacy of DBS for neurological and psychiatric disorders. This approach requires identifying neural biomarkers of relevant behavioral states, a task best performed in ecologically valid environments. Here, in human participants with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) implanted with recording-capable DBS devices, we synchronized chronic ventral striatum local field potentials with relevant, disease-specific behaviors. We captured over 1,000 h of local field potentials in the clinic and at home during unstructured activity, as well as during DBS and exposure therapy. The wide range of symptom severity over which the data were captured allowed us to identify candidate neural biomarkers of OCD symptom intensity. This work demonstrates the feasibility and utility of capturing chronic intracranial electrophysiology during daily symptom fluctuations to enable neural biomarker identification, a prerequisite for future development of adaptive DBS for OCD and other psychiatric disorders. The identification of candidate neural biomarkers of obsessive-compulsive disorder symptom intensity in ecologically valid environments."
https://openalex.org/W4200128418,"Abstract Host genetic factors can confer resistance against malaria 1 , raising the question of whether this has led to evolutionary adaptation of parasite populations. Here we searched for association between candidate host and parasite genetic variants in 3,346 Gambian and Kenyan children with severe malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum . We identified a strong association between sickle haemoglobin (HbS) in the host and three regions of the parasite genome, which is not explained by population structure or other covariates, and which is replicated in additional samples. The HbS-associated alleles include nonsynonymous variants in the gene for the acyl-CoA synthetase family member 2–4 PfACS8 on chromosome 2, in a second region of chromosome 2, and in a region containing structural variation on chromosome 11. The alleles are in strong linkage disequilibrium and have frequencies that covary with the frequency of HbS across populations, in particular being much more common in Africa than other parts of the world. The estimated protective effect of HbS against severe malaria, as determined by comparison of cases with population controls, varies greatly according to the parasite genotype at these three loci. These findings open up a new avenue of enquiry into the biological and epidemiological significance of the HbS-associated polymorphisms in the parasite genome and the evolutionary forces that have led to their high frequency and strong linkage disequilibrium in African P. falciparum populations."
https://openalex.org/W4226299391,"Social capital has been associated with health outcomes in communities and can explain variations in different geographic localities. Social capital has also been associated with behaviors that promote better health and reduce the impacts of diseases. During the COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing, face masking, and vaccination have all been essential in controlling contagion. These behaviors have not been uniformly adopted by communities in the United States. Using different facets of social capital to explain the differences in public behaviors among communities during pandemics is lacking.This study examines the relationship among public health behavior-vaccination, face masking, and physical distancing-during COVID-19 pandemic and social capital indices in counties in the United States.We used publicly available vaccination data as of June 2021, face masking data in July 2020, and mobility data from mobile phones movements from the end of March 2020. Then, correlation analysis was conducted with county-level social capital index and its subindices (family unity, community health, institutional health, and collective efficacy) that were obtained from the Social Capital Project by the United States Senate.We found the social capital index and its subindices differentially correlate with different public health behaviors. Vaccination is associated with institutional health: positively with fully vaccinated population and negatively with vaccination hesitancy. Also, wearing masks negatively associates with community health, whereases reduced mobility associates with better community health. Further, residential mobility positively associates with family unity. By comparing correlation coefficients, we find that social capital and its subindices have largest effect sizes on vaccination and residential mobility.Our results show that different facets of social capital are significantly associated with adoption of protective behaviors, e.g., social distancing, face masking, and vaccination. As such, our results suggest that differential facets of social capital imply a Swiss cheese model of pandemic control planning where, e.g., institutional health and community health, provide partially overlapping behavioral benefits."

Our findings highlight a potential extra-pancreatic source of beta cells and expose its molecular blueprint.
https://openalex.org/W4200525344,"Intracranial aneurysm (IA) rupture leads to subarachnoid hemorrhage, a sudden-onset disease that often causes death or severe disability. Although genome-wide association studies have identified common genetic variants that increase IA risk moderately, the contribution of variants with large effect remains poorly defined. Using whole-exome sequencing, we identified significant enrichment of rare, deleterious mutations in PPIL4, encoding peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase-like 4, in both familial and index IA cases. Ppil4 depletion in vertebrate models causes intracerebral hemorrhage, defects in cerebrovascular morphology and impaired Wnt signaling. Wild-type, but not IA-mutant, PPIL4 potentiates Wnt signaling by binding JMJD6, a known angiogenesis regulator and Wnt activator. These findings identify a novel PPIL4-dependent Wnt signaling mechanism involved in brain-specific angiogenesis and maintenance of cerebrovascular integrity and implicate PPIL4 gene mutations in the pathogenesis of IA."
https://openalex.org/W4200602857,"Cyberbullying is a modern form of bullying that could be practiced electronically or on the internet. It is related to different mental health issues such as depression, which can affect both the cyberbully and the victim. Although a few studies have been conducted regarding the prevalence of cyberbullying and cyber-victimization among the younger generation in Qatar, no studies have been conducted among young adults despite studies showing that they are also prone to cyberbullying.This is a cross-sectional study to investigate the prevalence and the relationship between cyberbullying, cyber-victimization, and depression symptoms among Qatar University students. A self-administered close-ended electronic questionnaire was used to assess student's cyberbullying/cyber-victimization behaviors and depression symptoms. The Revised Cyberbullying Inventory scale (RCBI-II) and Patient Health questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) were utilized to measure involvement in cyberbullying and depression symptoms, respectively. A total of 836 students participated in the study. Pearson Chi-Square test and binary logistic regression were conducted to analyze the data.Results indicated the majority of students have been involved in cyberbullying as follows: 6.8% cyberbullies, 29.2% cybervictims, 35.8% cyberbully-victims, and 28.2% not involved in either. Approximately 50% of the students scored a ten or higher on the PHQ9 test indicating symptoms of depression. Moreover, significant associations were found between cyberbullying experiences and gender (p = 0.03), depression and gender (p = 0.046), and between cyberbullying experiences and depression (p<0.001).Our findings indicate that among Qatar University students, cyberbullying and cyber-victimization are prevalent behaviors that could be associated with the high reported rates of depression symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W3197037987,"Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) performs non-invasive visualization and characterization of microvasculature in research and clinical applications mainly in ophthalmology and dermatology. A wide variety of instruments, imaging protocols, processing methods and metrics have been used to describe the microvasculature, such that comparing different study outcomes is currently not feasible. With the goal of contributing to standardization of OCTA data analysis, we report a user-friendly, open-source toolbox, OCTAVA (OCTA Vascular Analyzer), to automate the pre-processing, segmentation, and quantitative analysis of en face OCTA maximum intensity projection images in a standardized workflow. We present each analysis step, including optimization of filtering and choice of segmentation algorithm, and definition of metrics. We perform quantitative analysis of OCTA images from different commercial and non-commercial instruments and samples and show OCTAVA can accurately and reproducibly determine metrics for characterization of microvasculature.

https://openalex.org/W4200158680,"Healthcare and residential care workers represent two occupational groups that have, in particular, been at risk of Covid-19, its long-term consequences, and related sick leave. In this study, we investigated the predictors of prolonged sick leave among healthcare and residential workers due to non-hospitalized Covid-19 in the early period of the pandemic. This study is based on a patient register (n = 3209) and included non-hospitalized healthcare or residential care service workers with a positive RT- PCR for SARS-CoV-2 (n = 433) between March and August 2020. Data such as socio-demographics, clinical characteristics, and the length of sick leave because of Covid-19 and prior to the pandemic were extracted from the patient's electronic health records. Prolonged sick leave was defined as sick leave ≥ 3 weeks, based on the Swedish pandemic policy. A generalized linear model was used with a binary distribution, adjusted for age, gender, and comorbidity in order to predict prolonged sick leave. Of 433 (77% women) healthcare and residential care workers included in this study, 14.8% needed longer sick leave (> 3 weeks) due to Covid-19. Only 1.4% of the subjects were on sick leave because of long Covid. The risk of sick leave was increased two-fold among residential care workers (adjusted RR 2.14 [95% CI 1.31-3.51]). Depression/anxiety (adjusted RR 2.09 [95% CI 1.31-3.34]), obesity (adjusted RR 1.96 [95% CI 1.01-3.81]) and dyspnea at symptom onset (adjusted RR 2.47 [95% CI 1.55-3.92]), sick leave prior to the pandemic (3-12 weeks) (adjusted RR 2.23 [95% CI 1.21-4.10]) were associated with longer sick leave. From a public health perspective, considering occupational category, comorbidity, symptoms at onset, and sick leave prior to the pandemic as potential predictors of sick leave in healthcare may help prevent staff shortage."
https://openalex.org/W4200302217,"In eukaryotic cells, many messenger RNAs (mRNAs) possess upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in addition to the main coding region. After uORF translation, the ribosome could either recycle at the stop codon or resume scanning for downstream start codons in a process known as reinitiation. Accumulating evidence suggests that some initiation factors, including eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3), linger on the early elongating ribosome, forming an eIF3–80S complex. Very little is known about how eIF3 is carried along with the 80S during elongation and whether the eIF3–80S association is subject to regulation. Here, we report that eIF3a undergoes dynamic O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) modification in response to nutrient starvation. Stress-induced de-O-GlcNAcylation promotes eIF3 retention on the elongating ribosome and facilitates activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) reinitiation. Eliminating the modification site from eIF3a via CRISPR genome editing induces ATF4 reinitiation even under the nutrient-rich condition. Our findings illustrate a mechanism in balancing ribosome recycling and reinitiation, thereby linking the nutrient stress response and translational reprogramming. Nutrient stress induces ATF4 expression via translation reinitiation, which involves eIF3 retainment on the elongating ribosome. This translational reprogramming is mediated by stress-induced removal of the O-GlcNAc modification from eIF3a."
https://openalex.org/W4200451787,"Background Risk for severe COVID-19 increases with age. Different vaccination strategies are currently being considered, including those aimed at slowing down transmission and those aimed at providing direct protection to those most at risk. Methods The objectives of the current study were i) to assess age-related incidence and survival between PCR-diagnosed COVID-19 cases (n = 61,993) in the Autonomous Community of Aragon from March to November 2020, and ii) to characterize age differences regarding the course of the disease in hospitalized patients in a tertiary university hospital. Results We found a similar incidence of COVID-19 in individuals between 10 and 79 years. Incidence increased in those over 80 years possibly because of the elevated transmission within the nursing homes. We observed a profound disparity among age groups; case fatality rates (CFRs) were near 0 in cases younger than 39 years throughout different waves. In contrast, there was an age-dependent and progressive increase in the CFRs, especially during the first pandemic wave. SARS-CoV-2 infection caused a more severe and rapid progression in older patients. The elderly required faster hospitalization, presented more serious symptoms on admission, and had a worse clinical course. Hospitalized older individuals, even without comorbidities, had an increased mortality risk directly associated with their age. Lastly, the existence of comorbidities dramatically increased the CFRs in the elderly, especially in males. Conclusion The elevated incidence of COVID-19 and the vulnerability of the elderly call for their prioritization in vaccination and targeted prevention measures specifically focused on this aged population."
https://openalex.org/W4200315314,"HPV infection results in changes in host gene methylation which, in turn, are thought to contribute to the neoplastic progression of HPV-associated cancers. The objective of this study was to identify joint and disease-specific genome-wide methylation changes in anal and cervical cancer as well as changes in high-grade pre-neoplastic lesions. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) anal tissues (n = 143; 99% HPV+) and fresh frozen cervical tissues (n = 28; 100% HPV+) underwent microdissection, DNA extraction, HPV genotyping, bisulfite modification, DNA restoration (FFPE) and analysis by the Illumina HumanMethylation450 Array. Differentially methylated regions (DMR; t test q&lt;0.01, 3 consecutive significant CpG probes and mean Δβ methylation value&gt;0.3) were compared between normal and cancer specimens in partial least squares (PLS) models and then used to classify anal or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia-3 (AIN3/CIN3). In AC, an 84-gene PLS signature (355 significant probes) differentiated normal anal mucosa (NM; n = 9) from AC (n = 121) while a 36-gene PLS signature (173 significant probes) differentiated normal cervical epithelium (n = 10) from CC (n = 9). The CC progression signature was validated using three independent publicly available datasets (n = 424 cases). The AC and CC progression PLS signatures were interchangeable in segregating normal, AIN3/CIN3 and AC and CC and were found to include 17 common overlapping hypermethylated genes. Moreover, these signatures segregated AIN3/CIN3 lesions similarly into cancer-like and normal-like categories. Distinct methylation changes occur across the genome during the progression of AC and CC with overall similar profiles and add to the evidence suggesting that HPV-driven oncogenesis may result in similar non-random methylomic events. Our findings may lead to identification of potential epigenetic drivers of HPV-associated cancers and also, of potential markers to identify higher risk pre-cancerous lesions."
https://openalex.org/W4200422658,"This study aimed to analyze the gender-specific association of the filaggrin (FLG) gene polymorphisms with atopic dermatitis (AD) in Caucasians from the central region of Russia.The study sample consisted of 906 female (including 474 patients with AD and 432 controls) and 406 male (such as 226 patients with AD and 180 controls) participants. Genotyping of ten polymorphisms of the FLG gene was done. The logistic regression was used to analyze the associations. A total of 125 SNPs (seven AD-associated SNPs and 118 proxy SNPs, r2≥0.8) FLG gene were used for the in silico functional annotation analysis in the females.Significant associations were identified between seven SNPs of the FLG gene (rs12130219, rs61816761, rs558269137, rs12144049, rs3126085, rs471144, rs6661961) and AD in females: rs12144049 was associated independent individually (for allele C OR = 1.71, 95%Сl 1.19-2.46, рperm = 0.004 and OR = 1.76, 95%Сl 1.18-2.63, рperm = 0.006 according to the additive and dominant genetic models, respectively) and seven SNPs of the FLG gene within 14 haplotypes. Haplotype GGT [rs61816761-rs3126085-rs12144049] showed the strongest association (OR = 0.55, рperm = 0.001). No association between the analyzed SNPs and AD was determined in the male group. The subsequent bioinformatic analysis predicted the SNPs of the FLG gene that possessed epigenetic and non-synonymous effects, were involved in the control of gene expression and alternative splicing of genes that contribute to AD pathophysiology.Polymorphisms of the FLG gene are associated with AD in females but not in males in the Caucasian population of Central Russia."
https://openalex.org/W4200601319,"The present study investigated the Danish secular trend of intelligence test scores among young men born between 1940 and 2000, as well as the possible associations of birth cohort changes in family size, nutrition, education, and intelligence test score variability with the increasing secular trend. The study population included all men born from 1940 to 2000 who appeared before a draft board before 2020 ( N = 1,556,770). At the mandatory draft board examination, the approximately 19-year-old men underwent a medical examination and an intelligence test. In the statistical analyses, the IQ mean and standard deviation (SD) were estimated separately for each of the included annual birth cohorts based on information from birth cohorts with available total intelligence test scores for all tested individuals (i.e. 1940–1958 and 1987–2000; the mean and SD were interpolated for the intermediate birth cohorts). Moreover, the possible associations with birth cohort changes in family size, height as a proxy for nutritional status, education, and IQ variability were investigated among those birth cohorts for whom a secular increase in intelligence test scores was found. The results showed that the estimated mean IQ score increased from a baseline set to 100 (SD: 15) among individuals born in 1940 to 108.9 (SD: 12.2) among individuals born in 1980, since when it has decreased. Focusing on the birth cohorts of 1940–1980, for whom a secular increase in intelligence test scores was found, birth cohort changes in family size, height, and education explained large proportions of the birth cohort variance in mean intelligence test scores, suggesting that these factors may be important contributors to the observed Flynn effect in Denmark."

Samples were analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and differences in microbial community compositions between nonusers, single-, and multi-drug users as well as the 3 most commonly used medications (thyroid hormones, statins, and proton pump inhibitors (PPI)) were examined.Twenty-six percent of participants were taking 1 medication and 21% were reported taking 2 or more medications. Alpha diversity indices of Shannon diversity, Evenness, Richness, and Faith's phylogenetic diversity were similar among groups, likewise beta diversity as measured by Bray-Curtis dissimilarity (R2 = 0.0029, P = 0.053) and weighted UniFrac distances (R2 = 0.0028, P = 0.161) were non-significant although close to our alpha value threshold (P = 0.05). After controlling for covariates (sex, age, BMI), six genera (Saprospiraceae uncultured, Bacillus, Johnsonella, Actinobacillus, Stenotrophomonas, and Mycoplasma) were significantly different from non-medication users. Thyroid hormones, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) and PPI were the most reported medications. Shannon diversity differed significantly among those taking no medication and those taking only thyroid hormones, however, there were no significant difference in other measures of alpha- or beta diversity with single thyroid hormone, statin, or PPI use. Compared to participants taking no medications, the relative abundance of eight genera differed significantly in participants taking thyroid hormones, six genera differed in participants taking statins, and no significant differences were observed with participants taking PPI.The results from this study show negligible effect of commonly used medications on microbial diversity and small differences in the relative abundance of specific taxa, suggesting a minimal influence of commonly used medication on the salivary microbiome of individuals living without major chronic conditions."
https://openalex.org/W4200621128,"Ramp metering on freeway is one of the effective methods to alleviate traffic congestion. This paper advances the field of freeway ramp metering by introducing an application to the on-ramp, capitalizing on the macro traffic follow theory and improved the freeway traffic flow. The Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based on Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controller is further developed to single ramp metering as well as to optimize the PID parameters. The approach is applied to a case study of the Changyi Freeway(G5513) in Hunan, China. The simulation is conducted by applying the actual profile traffic data to PID controller to adjust the entering traffic flow on the freeway on-ramp. The results show that the PSO-PID controller tends to converge in about 80 minutes, and the density tends to be stable after 240 iterations. The system has smaller oscillation, more accurate adjustment of ramp regulation rate, and more ideal expected traffic flow density. The traffic congestion on mainline is effectively slowed down, traffic efficiency is improved, and travel time and cost are reduced. The nonlinear processing ability of PSO-PID controller overcomes the defects of the traditional manual closing ramp, and can be successfully applied in the field of intelligent ramp metering."

Granulation process for tablets manufacturing is generally optimized by hit and trial which involves preparation of granules under different processing parameters, compression of granules and evaluation of the resultant tablets; and adjustment is made in granulation process on the basis of characteristics of tablets. Objective of the study was to optimize the process of high shear wet granulation and prediction of characteristics of tablets on the basis of properties of granules. Atenolol granules were prepared by high shear wet granulation method, using aqueous solution of polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP k-30) as binder. Concentration of binder solution and granulation time were taken as process variables, both studied at three levels. Different combinations of process variables were determined by Design Expert software. Granules were evaluated for different parameters on the basis of SeDeM-ODT (Sediment Delivery Model-Oro Dispersible Tablets) expert system. Granules from all the trials were compressed using round (10.5 mm) flat faced punches at compression weight of 250 mg/tablet. Tablets were evaluated of different quality control parameters as per USP. Results showed that both the process variables had positive effect on mechanical strength of tablets and negative effect on disintegration and dissolution rate. Granule prepared with highest level of binder concentration (15%) and highest granulation time (60 sec) resulted in tablets with highest crushing strength (11.8 kg), specific crushing strength (0.328 kg/mm2), tensile strength (0.208 kg/mm2), lowest value of friability (0.19%) and highest disintegration time (10.9 min), as predicted from granules characteristics on the basis of SeDeM-ODT expert system. Drug release from Trial-13 (processed under highest level of both process parameters) was also lower than rest of the trials. It is concluded from the study that quality characteristics of tablets can be predicted from granules characteristics using SeDeM-ODT expert system. Furthermore, SeDeM-ODT expert system can also be used for optimization of the process of high shear wet granulation."
https://openalex.org/W4200449088,"Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) is increasingly becoming a viable option for infertile couples in Ghana. There exists significant literature that explores the gender, legal, religious and socio-cultural implications of ART usage. In this paper, we expand the discourse on the nexus between religion and ART usage by looking at how the former is used as a frame of reference in the decision-making process, as well as how it is employed to explain treatment successes and failures. Irrespective of religious orientation, there was a general acceptance of ART by participants in the study-with exceptions only when it came to some aspects of the procedure. Even here, participants' desperate desire to have children, tended to engender some accommodation of procedures they were uncomfortable with because of their religious beliefs. Thus, in contrast to some studies that suggest religion as interfering with ART use, we posit that religion is not an inhibiting factor to ART usage. On the contrary, it is an enabling factor, engendering the agentic attitude of participants to find a solution to their infertility in ART; as well as providing the strength to endure the physical and emotional discomfort associated with the biomedical process of conception and childbirth. In this context, religion thus provides participants with a frame of reference to navigate the spaces between decision-making, treatment processes and outcomes, and attributions of responsibility for the outcomes whatever they may be."
https://openalex.org/W4200456359,"Somatic characteristics manifested in different body morphology have great importance for the selection of athletes in most sports. The aim of our study is to evaluate the differences in anthropometric variables and isometric strength of handball players presenting different levels of sports competence, and to study the discriminative power of selected morphological characteristics that do not change in the training process. The study included the results of anthropometric measurements routinely used to monitor athletes, and body proportion indices were calculated. Fat percentage was assessed using the BIA, whereas body build was assessed using the Heath-Carter method. Measurements of right and left hand grip strength and back strength were taken. The results of measurements and calculations were analyzed using statistical methods. It was shown that players presenting the highest level dominate by the overall size and massiveness of the body, characteristics ensuring an advantage in direct confrontation. The size of subcutaneous fat tissue and percentage of body fat varied poorly between athletes in each group. Muscle strength assessed under static conditions shows a gradient in magnitude across teams from higher to lower rank, but the differences are not statistically significant. The same somatotype (balanced mesomorph) was present in all groups. Athletes presenting high sports level are characterized by body proportions that determine biomechanical conditions conducive to optimizing the structure of movements important in handball. Stepwise discriminant analysis showed that throwing-related characteristics (hand length, upper arm length, upper limb span, lower limb length) account for 88% of the variance in team ranking and can be used to identify the morphological predisposition of adepts to play handball."
https://openalex.org/W4200482239,"Modern ultrasound (US) imaging is increasing its clinical impact, particularly with the introduction of US-based quantitative imaging biomarkers. Continued development and validation of such novel imaging approaches requires imaging phantoms that recapitulate the underlying anatomy and pathology of interest. However, current US phantom designs are generally too simplistic to emulate the structure and variability of the human body. Therefore, there is a need to create a platform that is capable of generating well-characterized phantoms that can mimic the basic anatomical, functional, and mechanical properties of native tissues and pathologies. Using a 3D-printing technique based on stereolithography, we fabricated US phantoms using soft materials in a single fabrication session, without the need for material casting or back-filling. With this technique, we induced variable levels of stable US backscatter in our printed materials in anatomically relevant 3D patterns. Additionally, we controlled phantom stiffness from 7 to >120 kPa at the voxel level to generate isotropic and anisotropic phantoms for elasticity imaging. Lastly, we demonstrated the fabrication of channels with diameters as small as 60 micrometers and with complex geometry (e.g., tortuosity) capable of supporting blood-mimicking fluid flow. Collectively, these results show that projection-based stereolithography allows for customizable fabrication of complex US phantoms."
https://openalex.org/W3174539980,"We conducted a framed field experiment to explore a situation where individuals have potentially competing social identities to understand how group identification and socialisation affect in-group favouritism and out-group discrimination. The Dictator Game and the Trust Game were conducted in Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh City on two groups of high school students with different backgrounds, i.e., French bilingual and monolingual (Vietnamese) students. We find strong evidence for the presence of these two phenomena: our micro-analysis of within- and between-school effects show that bilingual students exhibit higher discriminatory behaviour toward non-bilinguals within the same school than toward other bilinguals from a different school, implying that group identity is a key factor in the explanation of intergroup cooperation and competition."
https://openalex.org/W4200003817,"In our study, core-shell nanoparticles containing lysozyme were formulated with precipitation and layering self-assembly. Factorial design (DoE) was applied by setting the process parameters during the preparation with Quality by Design (QbD) approach. The factors were the concentration of lysozyme and sodium alginate, and pH. Our aim was to understand the effect of process parameters through the determination of mathematical equations, based on which the optimization parameters can be predicted under different process parameters. The optimization parameters were encapsulation efficiency, particle size, enzyme activity and the amount of α-helix structure. The nanoparticles were analysed with transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. Based on our results, we found that pH was the most important factor and pH 10 was recommended during the formulation. Enzyme activity and α-helix content correlated with each other very well, and particle size and encapsulation efficiency also showed very good correlation with each other. The results of the α-helix content of FTIR and CD measurements were very similar for the precipitated lysozyme due to the solid state of lysozyme. The mixing time had the best influence on the encapsulation efficiency and the particle size, which leads to the conclusion that a mixing time of 1 h is recommended. The novelty in our study is the presentation of a mathematical model with which the secondary structure of the protein and other optimization parameters can be controlled in the future during development of nanoparticle based on the process parameters."
https://openalex.org/W4200067806,"Atherosclerosis is a lipid-driven chronic inflammatory disease that leads to the formation of plaques in the inner lining of arteries. Plaques form over a range of phenotypes, the most severe of which is vulnerable to rupture and causes most of the clinically significant events. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of nanoparticles (NPs) to differentiate between two plaque phenotypes based on accumulation kinetics in a mouse model of atherosclerosis. This model uses a perivascular cuff to induce two regions of disturbed wall shear stress (WSS) on the inner lining of the instrumented artery, low (upstream) and multidirectional (downstream), which, in turn, cause the development of an unstable and stable plaque phenotype, respectively. To evaluate the influence of each WSS condition, in addition to the final plaque phenotype, in determining NP uptake, mice were injected with NPs at intermediate and fully developed stages of plaque growth. The kinetics of artery wall uptake were assessed in vivo using dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. At the intermediate stage, there was no difference in NP uptake between the two WSS conditions, although both were different from the control arteries. At the fully-developed stage, however, NP uptake was reduced in plaques induced by low WSS, but not multidirectional WSS. Histological evaluation of plaques induced by low WSS revealed a significant inverse correlation between the presence of smooth muscle cells and NP accumulation, particularly at the plaque-lumen interface, which did not exist with other constituents (lipid and collagen) and was not present in plaques induced by multidirectional WSS. These findings demonstrate that NP accumulation can be used to differentiate between unstable and stable murine atherosclerosis, but accumulation kinetics are not directly influenced by the WSS condition. This tool could be used as a diagnostic to evaluate the efficacy of experimental therapeutics for atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W4200137484,"This study aimed to investigate the acute and delayed effects of medicine ball throws and resistance training in ball velocity and accuracy of serve, forehand and backhand in young competition tennis players. A crossover-randomized design was used with 10 competition tennis players (6 girls and 4 boys between 14 and 18 years old). The subjects performed 6 stroke test sessions, 3 for each strength protocol. The velocity and accuracy of strokes were measured before (basal situation), 3 minutes, 24 and 48 hours after the protocol. Medicine ball throws protocol was performed by accomplishing 3 sets of 6 repetitions using a 2 kg ball, throwing it at maximal speed. Resistance training protocol was performed by accomplishing 3 sets of 6 repetitions at 75% one-repetition maximum, lifting the load at maximal speed of bench press, dead lift, one hand row and half squat. There were no significant (p > 0.05) differences in all strokes, regarding ball velocity and accuracy after each method and each recovery time, compared to the basal situation. These results suggest that medicine ball throws and resistance training methods have no acute and delayed detrimental effects on stroke velocity and accuracy in young competition tennis players."
https://openalex.org/W4200411197,"Studies have shown that areas with lower socioeconomic standings are often more vulnerable to dengue and similar deadly diseases that can be spread through mosquitoes. This study aims to detect water tanks installed on rooftops and swimming pools in digital images to identify and classify areas based on the socioeconomic index, in order to assist public health programs in the control of diseases linked to the Aedes aegypti mosquito. This study covers four regions of Campinas, São Paulo, characterized by different socioeconomic contexts. With mosaics of images obtained by a 12.1 MP Canon PowerShot S100 (5.2 mm focal length) carried by unmanned aerial vehicles, we developed deep learning algorithms in the scope of computer vision for the detection of water tanks and swimming pools. An object detection model, which was initially created for areas of Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, was enhanced using the transfer learning technique, and allowed us to detect objects in Campinas with fewer samples and more efficiency. With the detection of objects in digital images, the proportions of objects per square kilometer for each region studied were estimated by adopting a Chi-square distribution model. Thus, we found that regions with low socioeconomic status had more exposed water tanks, while regions with high socioeconomic levels had more exposed pools. Using deep learning approaches, we created a useful tool for Ae. aegypti control programs to utilize and direct disease prevention efforts. Therefore, we concluded that it is possible to detect objects directly related to the socioeconomic level of a given region from digital images, which encourages the practicality of this approach for studies aimed towards public health."
https://openalex.org/W4200531154,"Dairy cows at dry-off undergo several management and physiological changes, resulting in alterations in plasma biomarkers of inflammation, oxidative stress, and immune system. High milk yield at the end of lactation exacerbates these responses. The underlying mechanism of these changes has yet to be elucidated. We hypothesized altered leukocyte gene expression after dry-off and different responses in cows with different milk yield. Thirteen Holstein dairy cows were sampled at the turn of dry-off to investigated whole blood leukocyte gene expression and were grouped according to the average milk yield during the last week of lactation: low (< 15 kg/d) and high milk yield (> 15 kg/d). Blood samples were collected in PAXgene tubes (Preanalytix, Hombrechtikon, Switzerland) at -7, 7, and 34 days from dry-off (DFD) to measure mRNA abundance of 37 genes. Normalized gene abundance data were subjected to MIXED model ANOVA (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Compared with -7 DFD, at 7 DFD RNA abundance of lipoxygenase genes (ALOX5, ALOX15) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) increased, and that of the antioxidant gene (SOD2) decreased. Meanwhile, genes related to recognition and immune mediation (CD16, MYD88, TLR2), migration and cell adhesion (CX3CR1, ITGAL, ITGB2, TLN1), and the antimicrobial gene MMP9 were downregulated at 7 or 34 DFD, whereas the antimicrobial IDO1 gene was upregulated. Compared with low-producing cows, cows with high milk yield at dry-off cows had upregulated expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL8 and IL18 and a greater reduction in transcript abundance of the toll-like receptor (TLR) recognition-related gene TLR2. Overall, the dry-off confirmed to be a phase of intense changes, triggering an inflammatory response and somewhat suppressing leukocyte immune function. In cows with high milk yield during the week before dry-off, the inflammatory response was exacerbated."
https://openalex.org/W4200037173,"Chronic plantar heel pain (CPHP) is associated with calcaneal bone spurs, but its associations with other calcaneal bone features are unknown. This study therefore aimed to determine associations between having CPHP and bone density and microarchitecture of the calcaneus. We assessed 220 participants with CPHP and 100 age- and sex-matched population-based controls. Trabecular bone density, thickness, separation and number, BV/TV, and cortical density, thickness and area were measured using a Scanco Xtreme1 HR-pQCT scanner at a plantar and mid-calcaneal site. Clinical, physical activity and disease history data were also collected. Associations with bone outcomes were assessed using multivariable linear regression adjusting for age, sex, physical activity, BMI and ankle plantarflexor strength. We assessed for potential effect modification of CPHP on these covariates using interaction terms. There were univariable associations at the plantar calcaneus where higher trabecular bone density, BV/TV and thickness and lower trabecular separation were associated with CPHP. In multivariable models, having CPHP was not independently associated with any bone outcome, but modified associations of BMI and ankle plantarflexor strength with mid-calcaneal and plantar bone outcomes respectively. Beneficial associations of BMI with mid-calcaneal trabecular density (BMI-case interaction standardised X/unstandardised Y beta -10.8(mgHA/cm3) (se 4.6), thickness -0.002(mm) (se 0.001) and BV/TV -0.009(%) (se 0.004) were reduced in people with CPHP. Beneficial associations of ankle plantarflexor strength with plantar trabecular density (ankle plantarflexor strength -case interaction -11.9(mgHA/cm3) (se 4.4)), thickness -0.003(mm) (se 0.001), separation -0.003(mm) (se 0.001) and BV/TV -0.010(%) (se 0.004) were also reduced. CPHP may have consequences for calcaneal bone density and microarchitecture by modifying associations of BMI and ankle plantarflexor strength with calcaneal bone outcomes. The reasons for these case-control differences are uncertain but could include a bone response to entheseal stress, altered loading habits and/or pain mechanisms. Confirmation with longitudinal study is required."
https://openalex.org/W4200105544,"NPC is the most widely found malignant tumor in the head and neck region in Indonesia. Chemoradiation therapy for NPC can induce swallowing disorders (dysphagia) that adversely affects a patients quality of life. This study aimed to assess the swallowing process by flexible endoscopic evaluation of swallowing in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma after chemoradiation. Thirty-nine patients with NPC who had chemoradiation therapy more than one month previously underwent flexible endoscopic evaluation of swallowing and were assessed for oral transport time, sensation, standing-secretion, pre-swallowing leakage, residue, penetration, aspiration, and silent aspiration. The most common structural abnormalities were an upright and swollen epiglottis (89.4%), poor oral hygiene, and velopharyngeal closure defects (56.4%). This examination also revealed a mild degree of standing secretion (38.5%) and aspiration (10.3%). No penetration was observed in 64.1% of the patients, and no silent aspiration was observed in any of the patients. A severe degree of residue (45.7%) was observed when administering oatmeal, while the residue was mild to moderate when administering gastric rice, crackers, and milk. The residue changed to a mild degree (32.3%-51.4%) in all food administrations after the watering maneuver. The highest penetration was noted after oatmeal administration (42.8%), and the highest aspiration was found after milk administration (8.6%). Standing secretion in almost all patients was caused by hyposensitivity of the hypopharynx. Persistent residue and hyposensitivity of the hypopharynx led to aspiration. The low percentage of aspiration and silent aspiration might have been caused by the upright and swollen epiglottis that prevented aspiration. Poor oral hygiene and a dry mouth led to prolonged oral transport. Therefore, most patients had hypopharyngeal abnormalities in the form of a swollen and upright epiglottis. Secretion and food residue were also detected. Drinking helps to expedite the swallowing process by facilitating oral phase transport and reducing residues."
https://openalex.org/W4200108728,"Using data from three national surveys of US adults (one cohort and two cross-sectional studies, covering the period from the mid-1990s to the mid-2010s), we quantify the degree to which disparities by socioeconomic status (SES) in self-reported pain and physical limitations widened and explore whether they widened more in midlife than in later life. Unlike most prior studies that use proxy measures of SES (e.g., education), we use a multidimensional measure of SES that enables us to evaluate changes over time in each outcome for fixed percentiles of the population, thereby avoiding the problem of lagged selection bias. Results across multiple datasets demonstrate that socioeconomic disparities in pain and physical limitations consistently widened since the late 1990s, and if anything, widened even more in midlife than in late life (above 75). For those aged 50-74, the SES disparities in most outcomes widened by more than 50% and in some cases, the SES gap more than doubled. In contrast, the magnitude of SES widening was much smaller above age 75 and, in the vast majority of cases, not significant. Pain prevalence increased at all levels of SES, but disadvantaged Americans suffered the largest increases. Physical function deteriorated for those with low SES, but there was little change and perhaps improvement among the most advantaged Americans. At the 10th percentile of SES, the predicted percentage with a physical limitation at age 50 increased by 6-10 points between the late-1990s and the 2010s, whereas at the 90th percentile of SES, there was no change in two surveys and in the third survey, the corresponding percentage declined from 31% in 1996-99 to 22% in 2016-18. The worst-off Americans are being left behind in a sea of pain and physical infirmity, which may have dire consequences for their quality of life and for society as a whole (e.g., lost productivity, public costs)."
https://openalex.org/W4200348135,"A key goal of disease surveillance is to identify outbreaks of known or novel diseases in a timely manner. Such an outbreak occurred in the UK associated with acute vomiting in dogs between December 2019 and March 2020. We tracked this outbreak using the clinical free text component of anonymised electronic health records (EHRs) collected from a sentinel network of participating veterinary practices. We sourced the free text (narrative) component of each EHR supplemented with one of 10 practitioner-derived main presenting complaints (MPCs), with the 'gastroenteric' MPC identifying cases involved in the disease outbreak. Such clinician-derived annotation systems can suffer from poor compliance requiring retrospective, often manual, coding, thereby limiting real-time usability, especially where an outbreak of a novel disease might not present clinically as a currently recognised syndrome or MPC. Here, we investigate the use of an unsupervised method of EHR annotation using latent Dirichlet allocation topic-modelling to identify topics inherent within the clinical narrative component of EHRs. The model comprised 30 topics which were used to annotate EHRs spanning the natural disease outbreak and investigate whether any given topic might mirror the outbreak time-course. Narratives were annotated using the Gensim Library LdaModel module for the topic best representing the text within them. Counts for narratives labelled with one of the topics significantly matched the disease outbreak based on the practitioner-derived 'gastroenteric' MPC (Spearman correlation 0.978); no other topics showed a similar time course. Using artificially injected outbreaks, it was possible to see other topics that would match other MPCs including respiratory disease. The underlying topics were readily evaluated using simple word-cloud representations and using a freely available package (LDAVis) providing rapid insight into the clinical basis of each topic. This work clearly shows that unsupervised record annotation using topic modelling linked to simple text visualisations can provide an easily interrogable method to identify and characterise outbreaks and other anomalies of known and previously un-characterised diseases based on changes in clinical narratives."

A total of 52 pregnant patients (104 eyes) diagnosed with preeclampsia were recruited during their hospital stay. The associations between the sFlt-1/PlGF ratio and chorioretinal measurements, including the choroidal thickness (CT), foveal avascular zone, vascular density, and ganglion cell layer+ were evaluated. Central and nasal subfield CT of the left eye (p = 0.039; p = 0.010) and nasal subfield CT of the right eye (p = 0.042) were lower in the high sFlt-1/PlGF ratio group (≥38). Pearson's correlation test showed a negative correlation between the sFlt-1/PlGF ratio and central subfield CT; however, this was not statistically significant (p = 0.648). Linear regression analysis revealed a significant association between the sFlt-1/PlGF ratio and central subfield CT (β coefficient, -6.66; p = 0.01) and between sFlt-1 and central subfield CT (β coefficient, -5.65; p = 0.00). Thus, an increase in the sFlt-1/PlGF ratio resulted in a decrease in central subfield CT."
https://openalex.org/W4200459214,"The front retaining wall (FRW) is an effective facility of selective withdrawal. Previous research has not estimated the effect of FRWs on the thermal regimes of reservoirs and outflow temperature, which are crucial to reservoir ecology. For this purpose, taking the Dongqing Reservoir as a case study, a two-dimensional hydrodynamic CE-QUAL-W2 model was configured for the typical channel-type reservoir in the southwestern Guizhou Province, to better understand the influence of FRWs on the thermal structure and outflow temperature. The simulated data from January to September 2017 showed that FRWs can change the vertical temperature distribution during the stratification period, accelerate the upper warmer water release and thus decrease the strength of thermal stratification. The stratification structure changed from a single thermocline to double thermoclines in August. An FRW resulted in an average 11.8 m increase in the thickness of the hypolimnion and a 1.2°C decrease in the thickness of the thermocline layer. An FRW increased the outflow temperature by 0.4°C and raised the withdrawal elevation by 16 m on average. The longitudinal velocity increased compared with the non-FRW condition, while the maximum velocity position moved up. In addition, FRWs can continuously obtain surface warmer water without manual operation and have low investment and good construction conditions. This study can provide an available selective withdrawal idea for reservoirs with similar hydraulic conditions."
https://openalex.org/W4200503465,"Introduction Clinical record (CR) is the primary tool used by healthcare workers (HCWs) to record clinical information and its completeness can help achieve safer practices. CR is the most appropriate source in order to measure and evaluate the quality of care. In order to achieve a safety climate is fundamental to involve a responsive healthcare workforce thorough peer-review and feedbacks. This study aims to develop a peer-review tool for clinical records quality assurance, presenting the seven-year experience in the evolution of it; secondary aims are to describe the CR completeness and HCWs’ diligence toward recording information in it. Methods To assess the completeness of CRs a peer-review tool was developed in a large Academic Hospital of Northern Italy. This tool included measurable items that examined different themes, moments and levels of the clinical process. Data were collected every three months between 2010 and 2016 by appointed and trained HCWs from 42 Units; the hospital Quality Unit was responsible for of processing and validating them. Variations in the proportion of CR completeness were assessed using Cochran-Armitage test for trends. Results A total of 9,408 CRs were evaluated. Overall CR completeness improved significantly from 79.6% in 2010 to 86.5% in 2016 (p&lt;0.001). Doctors’ attitude showed a trend similar to the overall completeness, while nurses improved more consistently (p&lt;0.001). Most items exploring themes, moments and levels registered a significant improvement in the early years, then flattened in last years. Results of the validation process were always above the cut-off of 75%. Conclusions This peer-review tool enabled the Quality Unit and hospital leadership to obtain a reliable picture of CRs completeness, while involving the HCWs in the quality evaluation. The completeness of CR showed an overall positive and significant trend during these seven years."

Association of HLA polymorphism with risk of various cancer types is well known. However, the association between HLA and glioblastoma (GBM) remains uncertain. We sought to evaluate the association of HLA polymorphism with risk of GBM development in Koreans.A case-control study was performed to identify the odds ratios (OR) of HLA class I and II genes for GBM. The control group consisted of 142 healthy Korean volunteers, and the GBM group was 80 patients with newly diagnosed GBM at our institution. HLA class I (-A, -B, and-C) and class II (-DR, -DQ, and-DP) genotyping was performed by high-resolution polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-sequence-based typing (PCR-SBT) methods.There were significantly decreased frequencies of HLA-A*26:02 (OR 0.22 CI 0.05-0.98), HLA-C*08:01 (OR 0.29 CI 0.10-0.87), and HLA-DRB1*08:03 (OR 0.32 CI 0.11-0.98), while there was significantly increased frequency of HLA-C*04:01 (OR 2.29 CI 1.05-4.97). In analysis of haplotypes, the frequency of DRB1*14:05-DQB1*05:03 was significantly decreased (OR 0.22 CI 0.05-0.98).This study suggests that genetic variations of HLA may affect GBM development in Koreans. Further investigations with larger sample sizes are needed to delineate any potential role of the HLA polymorphisms in the pathogenesis of GBM development."

Between 1977 and 2019, 26 diagnostic cases were examined from Kansas and throughout the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic, USA. We identified multiple causes of mortality in muskrats, but trauma (8/26), Tyzzer's disease (5/6), and cysticercosis (5/26) were the most common. We also conducted necropsies, during November 2018-January 2019 Pennsylvania muskrat trapping season, on 380 trapper-harvested muskrat carcasses after the pelt was removed. Tissue samples and exudate were tested for presence of or exposure to a suite of pathogens and contaminants. Gastrointestinal tracts were examined for helminths. Intestinal helminths were present in 39.2% of necropsied muskrats, with Hymenolepis spp. (62%) and echinostome spp. (44%) being the most common Molecular testing identified a low prevalence of infection with Clostridium piliforme in the feces and Sarcocystis spp. in the heart. We detected a low seroprevalence to Toxoplasma gondii (1/380). No muskrats were positive for Francisella tularensis or Babesia spp. Cysticercosis was detected in 20% (5/26) of diagnostic cases and 15% (57/380) of our trapper-harvested muskrats. Toxic concentrations of arsenic, cadmium, lead, or mercury were not detected in tested liver samples. Copper, molybdenum, and zinc concentrations were detected at acceptable levels comparative to previous studies. Parasite intensity and abundance were typical of historic reports; however, younger muskrats had higher intensity of infection than older muskrats which is contradictory to what has been previously reported. A diversity of pathogens and contaminants have been reported from muskrats, but the associated disease impacts are poorly understood. Our data are consistent with historic reports and highlight the wide range of parasites, pathogens and contaminants harbored by muskrats in Pennsylvania. The data collected are a critical component in assessing overall muskrat health and serve as a basis for understanding the impacts of disease on recent muskrat population declines."
https://openalex.org/W4200282443,"The population of women undergoing abdominal myomectomy for symptomatic large fibroid uterus is unique. We seek to characterize the timing, risk factors as well as the presenting symptoms which led patients to undergo repeat surgery in this patient population.We followed 592 patients who underwent an abdominal myomectomy from March 1998 to June 2010 at St. Vincent's Catholic Medical Center and presented later during the study period with a recurrence of symptoms attributable to a reemergence of fibroids and who chose to undergo repeat surgical management. Twelve percent of patients exhibited symptoms of fibroid uterus which led to reoperation within the study period. The mean age at repeat surgery was 44.1 ± 0.6 years old (n = 69) and the mean time between operations was 7.9 ± 0.3 years. Presentation was variable but included bleeding, pain and infertility. Patients presented for surgery with a significantly smaller sized uterus than at their initial surgery. Timing between surgeries correlated with age at initial surgery and uterine size but race, number of fibroids, aggregate weight of fibroids removed, operative time or blood loss at the initial surgery did not correlate. Data is suggestive that intraperitoneal triamcinolone may reduce reoperation rates but not timing of recurrence.These results may help in counseling patients, particularly younger women, on the risks of fibroid recurrence necessitating repeat surgery. Further research is necessary to assess if triamcinolone can alter fibroid reurrence in patients who undergo uterus sparing procedures."
https://openalex.org/W4200295902,"Myocardial infarction (MI), atherosclerosis and other inflammatory and ischemic cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) have a very high mortality rate and limited therapeutic options. Although the diagnosis is based on markers such as cardiac Troponin-T (cTrop-T), the mechanism of cTrop-T upregulation and release is relatively obscure. In the present study, we have investigated the mechanism of cTrop-T release during acute hypoxia (AH) in a mice model by ELISA &amp; immunohistochemistry. Our study showed that AH exposure significantly induces the expression and release of sterile inflammatory as well as MI markers in a time-dependent manner. We further demonstrated that activation of TLR3 (mediated by eRNA) by AH exposure in mice induced cTrop-T release and Poly I:C (TLR3 agonist) also induced cTrop-T release, but the pre-treatment of TLR3 immuno-neutralizing antibody or silencing of Tlr3 gene or RNaseA treatment two hrs before AH exposure, significantly abrogated AH-induced Caspase 3 activity as well as cTrop-T release. Our immunohistochemistry and Masson Trichrome (MT) staining studies further established the progression of myocardial injury by collagen accumulation, endothelial cell and leukocyte activation and adhesion in myocardial tissue which was abrogated significantly by pre-treatment of RNaseA 2 hrs before AH exposure. These data indicate that AH induced cTrop-T release is mediated via the eRNA-TLR3-Caspase 3 pathway."

Applying this approach to the car-sharing service case in Beijing, China, we find that: day-time business trips and evening entertainment trips around the city centre, commuting trips in off-peak time, and short-distance city travel for tourism are three travel scenarios suitable for car sharing's niche in the initial stage of market entering. Furthermore, spatio-temporal consumption profiles and competitive advantages of car sharing in the three travel scenarios are analyzed. Finally, theoretical and managerial implications are discussed. In this study, we address the question of finding niche market and suggest that it is critical for car sharing industry treading through the crisis in the early stage of development."
https://openalex.org/W4200370165,"Ecological restoration can promote biodiversity conservation in anthropogenically fragmented habitats, but effectiveness of these management efforts need to be statistically validated to determine 'success.' One such approach is to gauge the extent of recolonization as a measure of landscape permeability and, in turn, population connectivity. In this context, we estimated dispersal and population connectivity in prairie vole (Microtus ochrogaster; N = 231) and meadow vole (M. pennsylvanicus; N = 83) within five tall-grass prairie restoration sites embedded within the agricultural matrix of midwestern North America. We predicted that vole dispersal would be constrained by the extent of agricultural land surrounding restored habitat patches, spatially isolating vole populations and resulting in significant genetic structure. We first employed genetic assignment tests based on 15 microsatellite DNA loci to validate field-derived species-designations, then tested reclassified samples with multivariate and Bayesian clustering to assay for spatial and temporal genetic structure. Population connectivity was further evaluated by calculating pairwise FST, then potential demographic effects explored by computing migration rates, effective population size (Ne), and average relatedness (r). Genetic species assignments reclassified 25% of initial field identifications (N = 11 M. ochrogaster; N = 67 M. pennsylvanicus). In M. ochrogaster population connectivity was high across the study area, reflected in little to no spatial or temporal genetic structure. In M. pennsylvanicus genetic structure was detected, but relatedness estimates identified it as kin-clustering instead, underscoring social behavior among populations rather than spatial isolation as the cause. Estimates of Ne and r were stable across years, reflecting high dispersal and demographic resilience. Combined, these metrics suggest the agricultural matrix is highly permeable for voles and does not impede dispersal. High connectivity observed confirms that the restored landscape is productive and permeable for specific management targets such as voles and also demonstrates population genetic assays as a tool to statistically evaluate effectiveness of conservation initiatives."
https://openalex.org/W4200403978,"MhuD is a noncanonical heme oxygenase (HO) from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) that catalyzes unique heme degradation chemistry distinct from canonical HOs, generating mycobilin products without releasing carbon monoxide. Its crucial role in the Mtb heme uptake pathway has identified MhuD as an auspicious drug target. MhuD is capable of binding either one or two hemes within a single active site, but only the monoheme form was previously reported to be enzymatically active. Here we employed resonance Raman (rR) spectroscopy to examine several factors proposed to impact the reactivity of mono- and diheme MhuD, including heme ruffling, heme pocket hydrophobicity, and amino acid-heme interactions. We determined that the distal heme in the diheme MhuD active site has negligible effects on both the planarity of the His-coordinated heme macrocycle and the strength of the Fe-NHis linkage relative to the monoheme form. Our rR studies using isotopically labeled hemes unveiled unexpected biomolecular dynamics for the process of heme binding that converts MhuD from mono- to diheme form, where the second incoming heme replaces the first as the His75-coordinated heme. Ferrous CO-ligated diheme MhuD was found to exhibit multiple Fe-C-O conformers, one of which contains catalytically predisposed H-bonding interactions with the distal Asn7 residue identical to those in the monoheme form, implying that it is also enzymatically active. This was substantiated by activity assays and MS product analysis that confirmed the diheme form also degrades heme to mycobilins, redefining MhuD's functional paradigm and further expanding our understanding of its role in Mtb physiology."
https://openalex.org/W4226056136,"In 2020, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic caused major limitations for any aspect of social life and in specific for all events that require a gathering of people. While most events of this kind can be postponed or cancelled, democratic elections are key elements of any democratic regime and should be upheld if at all possible. Consequently, proper planning is required to establish the highest possible level of safety to both voters and scrutineers. In this paper, we present the novel and innovative way how the municipal council and district council elections in Vienna were planned and conducted using an discrete event simulation model. Key target of this process was to avoid queues in front of polling stations to reduce the risk of related infection clusters. In cooperation with a hygiene expert, we defined necessary precautions that should be met during the election in order to avoid the spread of COVID-19. In a next step, a simulation model was established and parametrized and validated using data from previous elections. Furthermore, the planned conditions were simulated to see whether excessive queues in front of any polling stations could form, as these could on the one hand act as an infection herd, and on the other hand, turn voters away. Our simulation identified some polling stations where long queues could emerge. However, splitting up these electoral branches resulted in a smooth election across all of Vienna. Looking back, the election did not lead to a significant increase of COVID-19 incidences. Therefore, it can be concluded that careful planning led to a safe election, despite the pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W4200041764,"With the construction and development of ultra-high voltage (UHV) power grids, large-scale, long-distance power transmission has become common. A failure of the connecting line between the sending-end power grid and the receiving-end power grid will cause a large-scale power shortage and a frequency drop in the receiving-end power grid, which can result in the frequency collapse. Presently, under-frequency load shedding (UFLS) is adopted for solving the frequency control problem in emergency under-frequency conditions, which can easily cause large load losses. In this context, a frequency coordination optimal control strategy is proposed, which combines the mode transition of pumped storage units with UFLS to deal with emergency under-frequency problems. First, a mathematical model of the frequency dynamic response is established, which combines the mode transition of pumped storage units with UFLS based on a single-machine equivalent model. Then, an optimal model of the minimal area of the power system's operation frequency trajectory is introduced, yielding the optimal frequency trajectory, and is used for obtaining the action frequency of the joint control strategy. A simulated annealing algorithm based on the perturbation analysis is proposed for solving the optimal model, and the optimal action frequency is obtained that satisfies the transient frequency offset safety constraint of the power system. Thus, the joint optimal control of the mode transition of the pumped storage units and UFLS is realized. Finally, the EPRI-36 bus system and China's actual power grid are considered, for demonstrating the efficiency of the proposed strategy."
https://openalex.org/W4200433921,"Numerous empirical and modeling studies have been done to find a relationship between postural stability and the susceptibility to motion sickness (MS). However, while the demonstration of a causal relationship between postural stability and the susceptibility to MS is still lacking, recent studies suggest that motion sick individuals have genuine deficits in selecting and reweighting multimodal sensory information. Here we investigate how the adaptation to changing postural situations develops and how the dynamics in multisensory integration is modulated on an individual basis along with MS susceptibility. We used a postural task in which participants stood on a posturographic platform with either eyes open (EO) or eyes closed (EC) during three minutes. The platform was static during the first minute (baseline phase), oscillated harmonically during the second minute (perturbation phase) and returned to its steady state for the third minute (return phase). Principal component (PC) analysis was applied to the sequence of short-term power density spectra of the antero-posterior position of the center of pressure. Results showed that the less motion-sick a participant is, the more similar is his balance between high and low frequencies for EO and EC conditions (as calculated from the eigenvector of the first PC). By fitting exponential decay models to the first PC score in the return phase, we estimated, for each participant in each condition, the sluggishness to return to the baseline spectrum. We showed that the de-adaptation following platform oscillation depends on the susceptibility to MS. These results suggest that non motion-sick participants finely adjust their spectrum in the perturbation phase (i.e. reweighting) and therefore take longer to return to their initial postural control particularly with eyes closed. Thus, people have idiosyncratic ways of doing sensory reweighting for postural control, these processes being tied to MS susceptibility."
https://openalex.org/W4200444238,"Outpatient rehabilitation was temporarily suspended because of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), and there was a risk that patients' activities of daily living (ADLs) would decrease and physical functions unmaintained. Therefore, we investigated the ADLs and motor functions of chronic stroke patients whose outpatient rehabilitation was temporarily interrupted.In this observational study, the Fugl-Meyer Assessment of the Upper Extremity (FMA-UE), Action Research Arm Test (ARAT), and Barthel Index (BI) scores of 49 stroke hemiplegic patients at 6 and 3 months before rehabilitation interruptions were retrospectively determined and were prospectively investigated on resumption of outpatient rehabilitation. Presence or absence of symptoms and difficulties caused by the interruption period (IP) was investigated using a binomial method. Deltas were analyzed using a generalized linear model (GLM) according to the survey period. Age, sex, severity of FMA-UE immediately post-resumption and post-onset period were used as covariates. For survey items showing significant model fit, the 95% confidence interval of minimum detectable change (MDC95) was calculated, and the amount of change was compared. Questionnaire responses were tested via proportion ratio. Statistical significance was set at 5%.The FMA-UE part A and total scores were significantly model fit depending on periods. The estimated FMA-UE total score decreased by 1.64 (z = -2.38, p = 0.02) during the 3-month IP. No fits were observed by GLM in other parts of the FMA-UE, ARAT, or BI. The calculated MDC95 was 3.58 for FMA-UE part A and 4.50 for FMA-UE overall. Answers to questions regarding sleep disturbance and physical pain were significantly biased toward ""no"" in the psychosomatic function items (p<0.05). There was no bias in the distribution of answers to questions regarding joint stiffness, muscle weakness, muscle stiffness, and difficulty in moving arms and hands. All 16 questions regarding activities and participation items were significantly biased toward answers ""no"" (p<0.05).The FMA-UE part A and total scores were affected. Patients complained of subjective symptoms related to upper limb paralysis after the IP. Since ADLs of patients were maintained, the therapist can recommend that patients not receiving outpatient treatments be evaluated in relation to the shoulder, elbow, and forearm and instructed on self-training to maintain motor function."
https://openalex.org/W4200446379,"Angiogenesis is required in embryonic development and tissue repair in the adult. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) initiates angiogenesis, and VEGF or its receptor is targeted therapeutically to block pathological angiogenesis. Additional pro-angiogenic cues, such as CXCL12 acting via the CXCR4 receptor, co-operate with VEGF/VEGFR2 to cue vascular patterning. We studied the role of FGD5, an endothelial Rho GTP/GDP exchange factor (RhoGEF), to regulate CXCR4-dependent signals in the endothelial cell (EC). Patient-derived renal cell carcinomas produce a complex milieu of growth factors that stimulated sprouting angiogenesis and endothelial tip cell differentiation ex vivo that was blocked by EC FGD5 loss. In a simplified model, CXCL12 augmented sprouting and tip gene expression under conditions where VEGF was limiting. CXCL12-stimulated tip cell differentiation was dependent on PI3 kinase (PI3K)-β activity. Knockdown of EC FGD5 abolished CXCR4 signaling to PI3K-β and Akt. Further, inhibition of Rac1, a Rho GTPase required for PI3K-β activity, recapitulated the signaling defects of FGD5 deficiency, suggesting that FGD5 may regulate PI3K-β activity through Rac1. Overexpression of a RhoGEF deficient, Dbl domain-deleted FGD5 mutant reduced CXCL12-stimulated Akt phosphorylation and failed to rescue PI3K signaling in native FGD5-deficient EC, indicating that FGD5 RhoGEF activity is required for FDG5 function. Endothelial expression of mutant PI3K-β with an inactivated Rho binding domain confirmed that CXCL12-stimulated PI3K activity in EC requires Rac1-GTP co-regulation. Together, this data identify the role of FGD5 to generate Rac1-GTP to regulate pro-angiogenic CXCR4-dependent PI3K-β signaling in EC. Inhibition of FGD5 activity may complement current angiogenesis inhibitor drugs."
