https://openalex.org/W1987693322,"One of the most striking phenomena in condensed-matter physics is the quantum Hall effect, which arises in two-dimensional electron systems subject to a large magnetic field applied perpendicular to the plane in which the electrons reside. In such circumstances, current is carried by electrons along the edges of the system, in so-called chiral edge states (CESs). These are states that, as a consequence of nontrivial topological properties of the bulk electronic band structure, have a unique directionality and are robust against scattering from disorder. Recently, it was theoretically predicted that electromagnetic analogues of such electronic edge states could be observed in photonic crystals, which are materials having refractive-index variations with a periodicity comparable to the wavelength of the light passing through them. Here we report the experimental realization and observation of such electromagnetic CESs in a magneto-optical photonic crystal fabricated in the microwave regime. We demonstrate that, like their electronic counterparts, electromagnetic CESs can travel in only one direction and are very robust against scattering from disorder; we find that even large metallic scatterers placed in the path of the propagating edge modes do not induce reflections. These modes may enable the production of new classes of electromagnetic device and experiments that would be impossible using conventional reciprocal photonic states alone. Furthermore, our experimental demonstration and study of photonic CESs provides strong support for the generalization and application of topological band theories to classical and bosonic systems, and may lead to the realization and observation of topological phenomena in a generally much more controlled and customizable fashion than is typically possible with electronic systems."
https://openalex.org/W2004834404,"Next-generation sequencing approaches have been used to investigate the genomes and transcriptomes of an oestrogen-receptor-α-positive metastatic lobular breast cancer from a patient — rather than from a cell line or xenograft — over a 9-year period between the diagnosis of the primary tumour and the appearance of metastasis. Comparison of the somatic non-synonymous coding mutations in the metastasis and the primary tumour of the same patient and the combined analysis of genome and transcriptome data provided insights into the mutational evolution that can occur with disease progression. The cover shows sequence elements of the HAUS3 locus, one of the genes found to be mutated in the tissue (shown in the background) from the primary lobular cancer used for this work. Advances in next generation sequencing have made it possible to precisely characterize the coding mutations that occur during the development and progression of individual cancers. Here, this technique is used to sequence the genomes and transcriptomes of an oestrogen-receptor-α-positive metastatic lobular breast cancer; significant evolution is found to occur with disease progression. Recent advances in next generation sequencing1,2,3,4 have made it possible to precisely characterize all somatic coding mutations that occur during the development and progression of individual cancers. Here we used these approaches to sequence the genomes (>43-fold coverage) and transcriptomes of an oestrogen-receptor-α-positive metastatic lobular breast cancer at depth. We found 32 somatic non-synonymous coding mutations present in the metastasis, and measured the frequency of these somatic mutations in DNA from the primary tumour of the same patient, which arose 9 years earlier. Five of the 32 mutations (in ABCB11, HAUS3, SLC24A4, SNX4 and PALB2) were prevalent in the DNA of the primary tumour removed at diagnosis 9 years earlier, six (in KIF1C, USP28, MYH8, MORC1, KIAA1468 and RNASEH2A) were present at lower frequencies (1–13%), 19 were not detected in the primary tumour, and two were undetermined. The combined analysis of genome and transcriptome data revealed two new RNA-editing events that recode the amino acid sequence of SRP9 and COG3. Taken together, our data show that single nucleotide mutational heterogeneity can be a property of low or intermediate grade primary breast cancers and that significant evolution can occur with disease progression."
https://openalex.org/W2004587064,"230Th-dated oxygen isotope records of stalagmites from Sanbao Cave, China, characterize Asian Monsoon (AM) precipitation through the ends of the third- and fourthmost recent ice ages. As a result, AM records for the past four glacial terminations can now be precisely correlated with those from ice cores and marine sediments, establishing the timing and sequence of major events. In all four cases, observations are consistent with a classic Northern Hemisphere summer insolation intensity trigger for an initial retreat of northern ice sheets. Meltwater and icebergs entering the North Atlantic alter oceanic and atmospheric circulation and associated fluxes of heat and carbon, causing increases in atmospheric CO2 and Antarctic temperatures that drive the termination in the Southern Hemisphere. Increasing CO2 and summer insolation drive recession of northern ice sheets, with probable positive feedbacks between sea level and CO2."

It is thus somewhat baffling that in arctic regions and in marine sediments, enormous quantities of methane lie trapped under pressure in surrounding cages of ice. Walsh et al. (p. 1095 , published online 8 October; see the Perspective by Debenedetti and Sarupria ) undertook extended simulations to probe the steps that guide these two normally incompatible molecules along convergent, rather than divergent, paths. Computed 2- and 5-microsecond trajectories trace the process of methane capture as ice crystals nucleate and ultimately assemble into a cage network."

A genome-wide scan using half a million genome-wide SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) in a common set of 1,031 multiplex autism families has now revealed significant linkage and association to autism. The linkage regions identified provide targets for rare variation screening while the discovery of a single novel association, between SEMA5A and TAS2R1 on chromosome 5p15. The expression of SEMA5A was found to be reduced in brains from autistic patients, further confirmation that it is an autism susceptibility gene. Autism is a highly heritable neurodevelopmental disorder, and yet few specific susceptibility genes have been identified to date. A linkage and association mapping study using half a million genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms is now described in a common set of 1,031 multiplex autism families. The linkage regions identified provide targets for rare variation screening whereas the discovery of a single novel association, SEMA5A, demonstrates the action of common variants. Although autism is a highly heritable neurodevelopmental disorder, attempts to identify specific susceptibility genes have thus far met with limited success1. Genome-wide association studies using half a million or more markers, particularly those with very large sample sizes achieved through meta-analysis, have shown great success in mapping genes for other complex genetic traits. Consequently, we initiated a linkage and association mapping study using half a million genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a common set of 1,031 multiplex autism families (1,553 affected offspring). We identified regions of suggestive and significant linkage on chromosomes 6q27 and 20p13, respectively. Initial analysis did not yield genome-wide significant associations; however, genotyping of top hits in additional families revealed an SNP on chromosome 5p15 (between SEMA5A and TAS2R1) that was significantly associated with autism (P = 2 × 10-7). We also demonstrated that expression of SEMA5A is reduced in brains from autistic patients, further implicating SEMA5A as an autism susceptibility gene. The linkage regions reported here provide targets for rare variation screening whereas the discovery of a single novel association demonstrates the action of common variants."

Ice cores provide a detailed and direct record of CO 2 concentrations over the past 800,000 years, but not earlier. Tripati et al. (p. 1394 , published online 8 October) report B/Ca measurements of planktonic foraminifera, from which they can infer atmospheric CO 2 concentrations, for the past 20 million years. The concentration of atmospheric CO 2 was similar to preindustrial values for the past 10 millions years, but between 15 and 20 million years ago, during the warm lower Miocene epoch, CO 2 was more abundant, and major climate transitions toward cooler conditions occurred when CO 2 decreased substantially."
https://openalex.org/W2027844795,"Quantum mechanics predicts that the equilibrium state of a resistive metal ring will contain a dissipationless current. This persistent current has been the focus of considerable theoretical and experimental work, but its basic properties remain a topic of controversy. The main experimental challenges in studying persistent currents have been the small signals they produce and their exceptional sensitivity to their environment. We have developed a technique for detecting persistent currents that allows us to measure the persistent current in metal rings over a wide range of temperatures, ring sizes, and magnetic fields. Measurements of both a single ring and arrays of rings agree well with calculations based on a model of non-interacting electrons."
https://openalex.org/W2085531754,"The deubiquitinating enzyme BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP1) possesses growth inhibitory activity and functions as a tumor suppressor. In this study we report that BAP1 also plays positive roles in cell proliferation. BAP1 depletion by RNAi inhibits cell proliferation as does overexpression of a dominant negative mutant of BAP1. Mass spectrometry analyses of copurified proteins revealed that BAP1 is associated with factors involved in chromatin modulation and transcriptional regulation. We show that the interaction with host cell factor-1 (HCF-1), a cell-cycle regulator composed of HCF-1N and HCF-1C, is critical for the BAP1-mediated growth regulation. We found that HCF-1N is modified with Lys-48-linked polyubiquitin chains on its Kelch domain. The HCF-1 binding motif of BAP1 is required for interaction with HCF-1N and mediates deubiquitination of HCF-1N by BAP1. The importance of the BAP1-HCF-1 interaction is underscored by the fact that growth suppression by the dominant negative BAP1 mutant is entirely dependent on the HCF-1 binding motif. These results suggest that BAP1 regulates cell proliferation by deubiquitinating HCF-1."
https://openalex.org/W2073807266,"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor-2 (TRAF2) binds to cIAP1 and cIAP2 (cIAP1/2) and recruits them to the cytoplasmic domain of several members of the TNF receptor (TNFR) superfamily, including the TNF-TNFR1 ligand-receptor complex. Here, we define a cIAP1/2-interacting motif (CIM) within the TRAF-N domain of TRAF2, and we use TRAF2 CIM mutants to determine the role of TRAF2 and cIAP1/2 individually, and the TRAF2-cIAP1/2 interaction, in TNFR1-dependent signaling. We show that both the TRAF2 RING domain and the TRAF2 CIM are required to regulate NF-kappaB-inducing kinase stability and suppress constitutive noncanonical NF-kappaB activation. Conversely, following TNFR1 stimulation, cells bearing a CIM-mutated TRAF2 showed reduced canonical NF-kappaB activation and TNF-induced RIPK1 ubiquitylation. Remarkably, the RING domain of TRAF2 was dispensable for these functions. However, like the TRAF2 CIM, the RING domain of TRAF2 was required for protection against TNF-induced apoptosis. These results show that TRAF2 has anti-apoptotic signaling roles in addition to promoting NF-kappaB signaling and that efficient activation of NF-kappaB by TNFR1 requires the recruitment of cIAP1/2 by TRAF2."
https://openalex.org/W1971452760,"The Chaitén volcano in Chile erupted unexpectedly and explosively on 1 May 2008, and it is still erupting. The eruption has displaced over 5,000 people, and resulted in millions of dollars of lost revenue in Chile. It has also provided geophysicists the rare opportunity of directly observing a rhyolite magma fuelled eruption — the cause of some of Earth's largest explosive volcanic eruptions. Jonathan Castro and Donald Dingwell present petrological and experimental evidence to show that the hydrous rhyolite magma at Chaitén ascended very rapidly, with velocities of the order of a metre per second. Such rapid ascent, contrasting markedly with the behaviour of most silicic magmas, implies a transit time from storage depths greater than 5 km to the near surface of only 4 hours, leaving little warning time for such eruptions. This work suggests that rhyolitic volcanoes that have been active during the Holocene — the past 10,000 years or so — should be closely monitored, especially those near major centres of population. Although rhyolite magma has fuelled some of the Earth's largest explosive volcanic eruptions, our understanding of these events is incomplete due to the previous lack of direct observation of these eruptions. On 1 May 2008, Chaitén volcano in Chile erupted rhyolite magma unexpectedly and explosively. Here, petrological and experimental data are presented that indicate that the hydrous rhyolite magma at Chaitén ascended very rapidly from storage depth to near-surface, with velocities of the order of one metre per second. Rhyolite magma has fuelled some of the Earth’s largest explosive volcanic eruptions1. Our understanding of these events is incomplete, however, owing to the previous lack of directly observed eruptions. Chaitén volcano, in Chile’s northern Patagonia, erupted rhyolite magma unexpectedly and explosively on 1 May 2008 (ref. 2). Chaitén residents felt earthquakes about 24 hours before ash fell in their town and the eruption escalated into a Plinian column. Although such brief seismic forewarning of a major explosive basaltic eruption has been documented3, it is unprecedented for silicic magmas. As precursory volcanic unrest relates to magma migration from the storage region to the surface, the very short pre-eruptive warning at Chaitén probably reflects very rapid magma ascent through the sub-volcanic system. Here we present petrological and experimental data that indicate that the hydrous rhyolite magma at Chaitén ascended very rapidly, with velocities of the order of one metre per second. Such rapid ascent implies a transit time from storage depths greater than five kilometres to the near surface in about four hours. This result has implications for hazard mitigation because the rapidity of ascending rhyolite means that future eruptions may provide little warning."

https://openalex.org/W2119678176,"Background Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has been consistently associated with increased risk of lung cancer. However, previous studies have had limited ability to determine whether the association is due to smoking. Methodology/Principal Findings The Environment And Genetics in Lung cancer Etiology (EAGLE) population-based case-control study recruited 2100 cases and 2120 controls, of whom 1934 cases and 2108 controls reported about diagnosis of chronic bronchitis, emphysema, COPD (chronic bronchitis and/or emphysema), or asthma more than 1 year before enrollment. We estimated odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using logistic regression. After adjustment for smoking, other previous lung diseases, and study design variables, lung cancer risk was elevated among individuals with a history of chronic bronchitis (OR = 2.0, 95% CI = 1.5–2.5), emphysema (OR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.4–2.8), or COPD (OR = 2.5, 95% CI = 2.0–3.1). Among current smokers, association between chronic bronchitis and lung cancer was strongest among lighter smokers. Asthma was associated with a decreased risk of lung cancer in males (OR = 0.48, 95% CI = 0.30–0.78). Conclusions/Significance These results suggest that the associations of personal history of chronic bronchitis, emphysema, and COPD with increased risk of lung cancer are not entirely due to smoking. Inflammatory processes may both contribute to COPD and be important for lung carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2017413658,"Cold allodynia is a common feature of neuropathic pain however the underlying mechanisms of this enhanced sensitivity to cold are not known. Recently the transient receptor potential (TRP) channels TRPM8 and TRPA1 have been identified and proposed to be molecular sensors for cold. Here we have investigated the expression of TRPM8 and TRPA1 mRNA in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and examined the cold sensitivity of peripheral sensory neurons in the chronic construction injury (CCI) model of neuropathic pain in mice. In behavioral experiments, chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve induced a hypersensitivity to both cold and the TRPM8 agonist menthol that developed 2 days post injury and remained stable for at least 2 weeks. Using quantitative RT-PCR and in situ hybridization we examined the expression of TRPM8 and TRPA1 in DRG. Both channels displayed significantly reduced expression levels after injury with no change in their distribution pattern in identified neuronal subpopulations. Furthermore, in calcium imaging experiments, we detected no alterations in the number of cold or menthol responsive neurons in the DRG, or in the functional properties of cold transduction following injury. Intriguingly however, responses to the TRPA1 agonist mustard oil were strongly reduced. Our results indicate that injured sensory neurons do not develop abnormal cold sensitivity after chronic constriction injury and that alterations in the expression of TRPM8 and TRPA1 are unlikely to contribute directly to the pathogenesis of cold allodynia in this neuropathic pain model."
https://openalex.org/W2092860552,"RNA silencing is a conserved regulatory mechanism in fungi, plants and animals that regulates gene expression and defence against viruses and transgenes. Small silencing RNAs of approximately 20-30 nucleotides and their associated effector proteins, the Argonaute family proteins, are the central components in RNA silencing. A subset of small RNAs, such as microRNAs and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in plants, Piwi-interacting RNAs in animals and siRNAs in Drosophila, requires an additional crucial step for their maturation; that is, 2'-O-methylation on the 3' terminal nucleotide. A conserved S-adenosyl-l-methionine-dependent RNA methyltransferase, HUA ENHANCER 1 (HEN1), and its homologues are responsible for this specific modification. Here we report the 3.1 A crystal structure of full-length HEN1 from Arabidopsis in complex with a 22-nucleotide small RNA duplex and cofactor product S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine. Highly cooperative recognition of the small RNA substrate by multiple RNA binding domains and the methyltransferase domain in HEN1 measures the length of the RNA duplex and determines the substrate specificity. Metal ion coordination by both 2' and 3' hydroxyls on the 3'-terminal nucleotide and four invariant residues in the active site of the methyltransferase domain suggests a novel Mg(2+)-dependent 2'-O-methylation mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2072972071,"Glucose homeostasis is maintained by the orchestration of peripheral glucose utilization and hepatic glucose production, mainly by insulin. In this study, we found by utilizing a combined parallel chromatography mass profiling approach that lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) regulates glucose levels. LPC was found to stimulate glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes dose- and time-dependently, and this activity was found to be sensitive to variations in acyl chain lengths and to polar head group types in LPC. Treatment with LPC resulted in a significant increase in the level of GLUT4 at the plasma membranes of 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Moreover, LPC did not affect IRS-1 and AKT2 phosphorylations, and LPC-induced glucose uptake was not influenced by pretreatment with the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002. However, glucose uptake stimulation by LPC was abrogated both by rottlerin (a protein kinase Cδ inhibitor) and by the adenoviral expression of dominant negative protein kinase Cδ. In line with its determined cellular functions, LPC was found to lower blood glucose levels in normal mice. Furthermore, LPC improved blood glucose levels in mouse models of type 1 and 2 diabetes.

These results suggest that an understanding of the mode of action of LPC may provide a new perspective of glucose homeostasis. IntroductionGlucose is the most important metabolic fuel, and glucose homeostasis is maintained predominantly by insulin by balancing peripheral glucose uptake and hepatic glucose production (1.Saltiel A.R. Kahn C.R. Nature. 2001; 414: 799-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (3849) Google Scholar, 2.Chiasson J.L. Rabasa-Lhoret R. Diabetes. 2004; 53: fp>S34-S38Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar). However, if whole body glucose homeostasis is disrupted, hyperglycemia and various physiopathologies associated with metabolic disturbances may occur. The removal of excess glucose from the circulation involves the stimulation of glucose transport into metabolic tissues, and it has become clear that glucose intolerance in type 2 diabetes is manifested by defects in glucose transport into these metabolic tissues (3.Moller D.E. Nature. 2001; 414: 821-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar). Moreover, for many years, adipose tissue was believed to play key roles in glucose homeostasis (4.Hespel P. Vergauwen L. Vandenberghe K. Richter E.A. Diabetes. 1996; 45: S99-S104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In addition to insulin, various hormones and physiological conditions are capable of stimulating glucose uptake (5.Elmendorf J.S. J. Membr.

For example, the activation of α1-adrenergic or endothelinA receptors results in enhanced glucose uptake rates independently of insulin levels, and physical exercise also plays an important role in the metabolism of glucose by skeletal muscle (10.Richter E.A. Derave W. Wojtaszewski J.F. J. Physiol. 2001; 535: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 11.Kemppainen J. Fujimoto T. Kalliokoski K.K. Viljanen T. Nuutila P. Knuuti J. J.

Furthermore, some of the signaling mechanisms that mediate these metabolic responses are similar to those utilized by insulin, whereas others are clearly distinct (5.Elmendorf J.S. J. Membr. Biol. 2002; 190: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The above-mentioned processes illustrate that glucose regulation is not a simple event wholly attributable to insulin but rather a complex process that involves many glucose regulators. However, although the significance of insulin-independent glucose regulation has been recognized, no systematic search has been conducted to identify novel glucose regulators.Over the past few years, lysophospholipids have been increasingly recognized to be important cell signaling molecules (14.Xu Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1582: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), and one of these, lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), 2The abbreviations used are: LPClysophosphatidylcholineDNdominant negativePKCprotein kinase CHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographySTZstreptozotocinMS/MStandem mass spectrometryESIelectrospray ionizationDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumAdVadenovirusPMplasma membraneSCXcation exchangeIRSinsulin receptor substratePIphosphoinositideLPAlysophosphatidic acid. which is produced during both physiological and pathological conditions, has been shown to be involved in many cellular processes (15.Xu Y.

For example, it is known that LPC is a major plasma lipid component that transports fatty acids and choline to tissues (18.Croset M. Brossard N. Polette A. Lagarde M. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Moreover, although the mechanisms of LPC synthesis are not completely understood, the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine by plasma lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase is a possible mechanism of the in vivo synthesis of LPC (14.Xu Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1582: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). LPC exhibits diverse biological functions and has been reported to be involved in cellular proliferation, tumor cell invasiveness, and inflammation (14.Xu Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1582: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 19.Wang L. Radu C.G. Yang L.V. Bentolila L.A. Riedinger M. Witte O.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 2234-2247Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, little is known of the direct involvement of LPC in the metabolism of glucose. To identify novel serum factors that stimulate glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, we developed a new analytical technique based on parallel HPLC, protease digestion, and mass spectrometry. Using this modality, we found that LPC activates glucose uptake and effectively lowers blood glucose levels in mouse models of Type 1 and 2 diabetes.DISCUSSIONThe present study provides evidence that LPC is a blood-derived factor involved in glucose homeostasis. 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated with LPC were found to uptake glucose rapidly via PI 3-kinase-independent PKCδ activation. Furthermore, when acute intravenous LPC was administered to mouse models of type 1 and 2 diabetes, the blood glucose levels were significantly lowered. Accordingly, we suggest that LPC represents a novel insulin-independent signal that can regulate blood glucose levels in normal and diseased mouse models. Furthermore, our findings suggest that an understanding of the role played by LPC in glucose regulation would enhance our understanding of glucose metabolism.The stimulation of glucose uptake by 3T3-L1 adipocytes and the blood glucose lowering effect of LPC in mice were found to be sensitive to variations in LPC acyl chain length, i.e. whereas the palmitoyl and myristoyl LPC derivatives (16:0 and 14:0, respectively) enhanced glucose uptake by 3T3-L1 adipocytes, stearoyl, oleoyl, and arachidoyl LPC (18:0, 18:1, and 20:0, respectively) were ineffective. However, when 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with several lysophospholipids that differed structurally only in terms of the polar head group of palmitoyl LPC, glucose uptake by adipocytes was not increased (this structural specificity was also confirmed by our mouse model of type 1 and 2 diabetes). These findings suggest that both acyl chain length and the choline head group of LPC are critical for stimulating glucose uptake by 3T3-L1 adipocytes and for lowering blood glucose levels in mice. Based on the rapid onset and structural specificity of LPC, we speculate that the biological activity of LPC is possibly due to binding between LPC and a specific cell surface receptor. Several lysophospholipids have been reported to bind to G protein-coupled receptor family members (26.Contos J.J. Ishii I. Chun J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1188-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 27.Sugo T. Tachimoto H. Chikatsu T. Murakami Y. Kikukawa Y. Sato S. Kikuchi K. Nagi T. Harada M. Ogi K. Ebisawa M. Mori M.

Chem. 1998; 273: 7906-7910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). However, recently it was reported that LPC activates these receptors via a mechanism that does not involve direct binding (19.Wang L. Radu C.G. Yang L.V. Bentolila L.A. Riedinger M. Witte O.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 2234-2247Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), although earlier reports concluded that LPC binds directly to and activates G2A and GPR4. Thus, it remains an open question as to whether LPC stimulates glucose uptake by directly binding G2A and GPR4 or whether it does so indirectly via an as yet unknown mechanism.The involvement of conventional or atypical PKC activation in the promotion of glucose uptake by adipocytes and muscle cells is well established (30.Bandyopadhyay G. Standaert M.L. Zhao L. Yu B. Avignon A. Galloway L. Karnam P. Moscat J. Farese R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2551-2558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), but the activation of novel PKCs, especially of PKCδ, also controls glucose uptake. Stimulation of the translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane and glucose uptake by insulin were found to be inhibited by rottlerin in rat skeletal muscle cells, and the overexpression of PKCδ induced by GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane was found to increase basal glucose uptake to levels attained by insulin (31.Braiman L. Alt A. Kuroki T. Ohba M. Bak A. Tennenbaum T. Sampson S.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 2002-2012PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, LPC-induced glucose uptake was found to be significantly blocked by rottlerin and by the overexpression of DN-PKCδ. In contrast, pretreatment with Gö6976 (a conventional PKC inhibitor) and the expression of DN-PKCζ were found to have no effect on LPC-induced glucose uptake. These findings suggest that only PKCδ is required for LPC-induced glucose transport in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. However, it has not been established whether PKCδ is downstream of LPC receptors like G2A or GPR4, and thus, additional work is needed to further elucidate the natures of the signal mechanisms that trigger specific PKCδs to participate in LPC-induced glucose transport.The induction of insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells is a physiological function of LPC (32.Soga T. Ohishi T. Matsui T. Saito T. Matsumoto M. Takasaki J. Matsumoto S. Kamohara M. Hiyama H. Yoshida S. Momose K. Ueda Y. Matsushime H. Kobori M. Furuichi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 326: 744-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Recently, Suga et al. found that LPC induced insulin secretion by a pancreatic β-cell line (NIT-1) and by perfused rat pancreas under high glucose conditions (16.6 mm), but not under low glucose (2.8 mm) conditions (32.Soga T. Ohishi T. Matsui T. Saito T. Matsumoto M. Takasaki J. Matsumoto S. Kamohara M. Hiyama H. Yoshida S. Momose K. Ueda Y. Matsushime H. Kobori M. Furuichi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 326: 744-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). In the present study, we measured serum insulin levels in fasted mice with blood glucose concentrations of 3–5 mm after LPC administration and found that LPC had no effect. On the other hand, we found that LPC had a blood glucose lowering effect in STZ-treated insulin-deficient mice. Thus, these results obtained in our study potentially support that LPC can directly affect glucose lowering in mice.It is well known that LPA can be produced abundantly from LPC by autotoxin, which has lysophospholipase D activity (33.van Meeteren L.A. Moolenaar W.H. Prog. Lipid Res. 2007; 46: 145-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), and recently, it was reported that LPA has a glucose regulatory function (34.Yea K. Kim J. Lim S. Park H.S. Park K.S. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. J. Mol. Med. 2008; 86: 211-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been reported that LPA can associate with four types of LPA receptors, enhance glucose uptake by 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and reduce blood glucose levels by interacting with LPA1 or LPA3 receptors (34.Yea K. Kim J. Lim S. Park H.S. Park K.S. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. J. Mol. Med. 2008; 86: 211-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 35.Goetzl E.J. An S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1589-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). In addition, the authors showed that blood glucose reductions by LPA were significantly inhibited by Ki16425 (a selective LPA1 and LPA3 antagonist) (34.Yea K. Kim J. Lim S. Park H.S. Park K.S. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. J. Mol. Med. 2008; 86: 211-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether the blood glucose lowering effect of LPC is affected by Ki16425. However, although we found that the glucose lowering effect of LPA was blocked by Ki16425, it had no effect on the glucose reduction induced by LPC (Fig. 6d). Based on this result, we suggest that the LPC-induced glucose level reductions are not caused by LPA metabolized from LPC, but rather that these reductions are due to the direct effects of LPC.The physiologic concentrations of LPC in body fluids, such as blood and ascites, are substantial (5–180 μm) (14.Xu Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1582: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The levels of LPC are elevated in many diseases related to inflammation (15.Xu Y. Fang X.J. Casey G. Mills G.B. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 933-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). More recently, elevated LPC levels (in particular, the ratios of palmitoyl-LPC to linoleoyl-LPC) have been reported in ovarian cancer and multiple myeloma. Nevertheless, the changes in LPC concentration by glucose or other metabolic stimuli have not been characterized. Therefore, additional work is required on the regulation of LPC secretion and to confirm the effect of LPC on glucose metabolism.The present study provides the first evidence that blood-borne LPC is intimately involved in glucose homeostasis. It is our hope that this finding generates interest in the physiological and pathological roles of LPC in glucose metabolism. Finally, we believe that an understanding of the mechanism responsible for the metabolic effects of LPC could lead to the development of a novel means of treating diabetes. IntroductionGlucose is the most important metabolic fuel, and glucose homeostasis is maintained predominantly by insulin by balancing peripheral glucose uptake and hepatic glucose production (1.Saltiel A.R. Kahn C.R. Nature. 2001; 414: 799-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (3849) Google Scholar, 2.Chiasson J.L. Rabasa-Lhoret R. Diabetes. 2004; 53: fp>S34-S38Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar). However, if whole body glucose homeostasis is disrupted, hyperglycemia and various physiopathologies associated with metabolic disturbances may occur. The removal of excess glucose from the circulation involves the stimulation of glucose transport into metabolic tissues, and it has become clear that glucose intolerance in type 2 diabetes is manifested by defects in glucose transport into these metabolic tissues (3.Moller D.E. Nature. 2001; 414: 821-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar). Moreover, for many years, adipose tissue was believed to play key roles in glucose homeostasis (4.Hespel P. Vergauwen L. Vandenberghe K. Richter E.A. Diabetes. 1996; 45: S99-S104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In addition to insulin, various hormones and physiological conditions are capable of stimulating glucose uptake (5.Elmendorf J.S. J. Membr. Biol. 2002; 190: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 6.Hutchinson D.S. Bengtsson T. Diabetes. 2006; 55: 682-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 7.Perrini S. Natalicchio A.

For example, the activation of α1-adrenergic or endothelinA receptors results in enhanced glucose uptake rates independently of insulin levels, and physical exercise also plays an important role in the metabolism of glucose by skeletal muscle (10.Richter E.A. Derave W. Wojtaszewski J.F. J. Physiol. 2001; 535: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 11.Kemppainen J. Fujimoto T. Kalliokoski K.K. Viljanen T. Nuutila P. Knuuti J. J.

Imamura T. Sharma P.M. Ugi S. Olefsky J.M. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 4623-4628Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Furthermore, some of the signaling mechanisms that mediate these metabolic responses are similar to those utilized by insulin, whereas others are clearly distinct (5.Elmendorf J.S. J. Membr. Biol. 2002; 190: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The above-mentioned processes illustrate that glucose regulation is not a simple event wholly attributable to insulin but rather a complex process that involves many glucose regulators. However, although the significance of insulin-independent glucose regulation has been recognized, no systematic search has been conducted to identify novel glucose regulators.Over the past few years, lysophospholipids have been increasingly recognized to be important cell signaling molecules (14.Xu Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1582: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), and one of these, lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), 2The abbreviations used are: LPClysophosphatidylcholineDNdominant negativePKCprotein kinase CHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographySTZstreptozotocinMS/MStandem mass spectrometryESIelectrospray ionizationDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumAdVadenovirusPMplasma membraneSCXcation exchangeIRSinsulin receptor substratePIphosphoinositideLPAlysophosphatidic acid. which is produced during both physiological and pathological conditions, has been shown to be involved in many cellular processes (15.Xu Y.

For example, it is known that LPC is a major plasma lipid component that transports fatty acids and choline to tissues (18.Croset M. Brossard N. Polette A. Lagarde M. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Moreover, although the mechanisms of LPC synthesis are not completely understood, the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine by plasma lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase is a possible mechanism of the in vivo synthesis of LPC (14.Xu Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1582: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). LPC exhibits diverse biological functions and has been reported to be involved in cellular proliferation, tumor cell invasiveness, and inflammation (14.Xu Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1582: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 19.Wang L. Radu C.G. Yang L.V. Bentolila L.A. Riedinger M. Witte O.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 2234-2247Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, little is known of the direct involvement of LPC in the metabolism of glucose. To identify novel serum factors that stimulate glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, we developed a new analytical technique based on parallel HPLC, protease digestion, and mass spectrometry. Using this modality, we found that LPC activates glucose uptake and effectively lowers blood glucose levels in mouse models of Type 1 and 2 diabetes. Glucose is the most important metabolic fuel, and glucose homeostasis is maintained predominantly by insulin by balancing peripheral glucose uptake and hepatic glucose production (1.Saltiel A.R.

DISCUSSIONThe present study provides evidence that LPC is a blood-derived factor involved in glucose homeostasis. 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated with LPC were found to uptake glucose rapidly via PI 3-kinase-independent PKCδ activation. Furthermore, when acute intravenous LPC was administered to mouse models of type 1 and 2 diabetes, the blood glucose levels were significantly lowered. Accordingly, we suggest that LPC represents a novel insulin-independent signal that can regulate blood glucose levels in normal and diseased mouse models. Furthermore, our findings suggest that an understanding of the role played by LPC in glucose regulation would enhance our understanding of glucose metabolism.The stimulation of glucose uptake by 3T3-L1 adipocytes and the blood glucose lowering effect of LPC in mice were found to be sensitive to variations in LPC acyl chain length, i.e. whereas the palmitoyl and myristoyl LPC derivatives (16:0 and 14:0, respectively) enhanced glucose uptake by 3T3-L1 adipocytes, stearoyl, oleoyl, and arachidoyl LPC (18:0, 18:1, and 20:0, respectively) were ineffective. However, when 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with several lysophospholipids that differed structurally only in terms of the polar head group of palmitoyl LPC, glucose uptake by adipocytes was not increased (this structural specificity was also confirmed by our mouse model of type 1 and 2 diabetes). These findings suggest that both acyl chain length and the choline head group of LPC are critical for stimulating glucose uptake by 3T3-L1 adipocytes and for lowering blood glucose levels in mice. Based on the rapid onset and structural specificity of LPC, we speculate that the biological activity of LPC is possibly due to binding between LPC and a specific cell surface receptor. Several lysophospholipids have been reported to bind to G protein-coupled receptor family members (26.Contos J.J. Ishii I. Chun J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1188-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 27.Sugo T. Tachimoto H. Chikatsu T. Murakami Y. Kikukawa Y. Sato S. Kikuchi K. Nagi T. Harada M. Ogi K. Ebisawa M. Mori M.

Chem. 1998; 273: 7906-7910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). However, recently it was reported that LPC activates these receptors via a mechanism that does not involve direct binding (19.Wang L. Radu C.G. Yang L.V. Bentolila L.A. Riedinger M. Witte O.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 2234-2247Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), although earlier reports concluded that LPC binds directly to and activates G2A and GPR4. Thus, it remains an open question as to whether LPC stimulates glucose uptake by directly binding G2A and GPR4 or whether it does so indirectly via an as yet unknown mechanism.The involvement of conventional or atypical PKC activation in the promotion of glucose uptake by adipocytes and muscle cells is well established (30.Bandyopadhyay G. Standaert M.L. Zhao L. Yu B. Avignon A. Galloway L. Karnam P. Moscat J. Farese R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2551-2558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), but the activation of novel PKCs, especially of PKCδ, also controls glucose uptake. Stimulation of the translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane and glucose uptake by insulin were found to be inhibited by rottlerin in rat skeletal muscle cells, and the overexpression of PKCδ induced by GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane was found to increase basal glucose uptake to levels attained by insulin (31.Braiman L. Alt A. Kuroki T. Ohba M. Bak A. Tennenbaum T. Sampson S.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 2002-2012PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, LPC-induced glucose uptake was found to be significantly blocked by rottlerin and by the overexpression of DN-PKCδ. In contrast, pretreatment with Gö6976 (a conventional PKC inhibitor) and the expression of DN-PKCζ were found to have no effect on LPC-induced glucose uptake. These findings suggest that only PKCδ is required for LPC-induced glucose transport in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. However, it has not been established whether PKCδ is downstream of LPC receptors like G2A or GPR4, and thus, additional work is needed to further elucidate the natures of the signal mechanisms that trigger specific PKCδs to participate in LPC-induced glucose transport.The induction of insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells is a physiological function of LPC (32.Soga T.

Furthermore, it has been reported that LPA can associate with four types of LPA receptors, enhance glucose uptake by 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and reduce blood glucose levels by interacting with LPA1 or LPA3 receptors (34.Yea K.

In addition, the authors showed that blood glucose reductions by LPA were significantly inhibited by Ki16425 (a selective LPA1 and LPA3 antagonist) (34.Yea K. Kim J. Lim S. Park H.S. Park K.S. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. J. Mol. Med. 2008; 86: 211-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether the blood glucose lowering effect of LPC is affected by Ki16425. However, although we found that the glucose lowering effect of LPA was blocked by Ki16425, it had no effect on the glucose reduction induced by LPC (Fig. 6d). Based on this result, we suggest that the LPC-induced glucose level reductions are not caused by LPA metabolized from LPC, but rather that these reductions are due to the direct effects of LPC.The physiologic concentrations of LPC in body fluids, such as blood and ascites, are substantial (5–180 μm) (14.Xu Y.

These findings suggest that both acyl chain length and the choline head group of LPC are critical for stimulating glucose uptake by 3T3-L1 adipocytes and for lowering blood glucose levels in mice. Based on the rapid onset and structural specificity of LPC, we speculate that the biological activity of LPC is possibly due to binding between LPC and a specific cell surface receptor. Several lysophospholipids have been reported to bind to G protein-coupled receptor family members (26.Contos J.J. Ishii I. Chun J. Mol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 7906-7910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). However, recently it was reported that LPC activates these receptors via a mechanism that does not involve direct binding (19.Wang L. Radu C.G. Yang L.V. Bentolila L.A. Riedinger M. Witte O.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 2234-2247Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), although earlier reports concluded that LPC binds directly to and activates G2A and GPR4. Thus, it remains an open question as to whether LPC stimulates glucose uptake by directly binding G2A and GPR4 or whether it does so indirectly via an as yet unknown mechanism. The involvement of conventional or atypical PKC activation in the promotion of glucose uptake by adipocytes and muscle cells is well established (30.Bandyopadhyay G. Standaert M.L. Zhao L. Yu B. Avignon A. Galloway L. Karnam P. Moscat J. Farese R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2551-2558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), but the activation of novel PKCs, especially of PKCδ, also controls glucose uptake. Stimulation of the translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane and glucose uptake by insulin were found to be inhibited by rottlerin in rat skeletal muscle cells, and the overexpression of PKCδ induced by GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane was found to increase basal glucose uptake to levels attained by insulin (31.Braiman L. Alt A. Kuroki T. Ohba M. Bak A. Tennenbaum T. Sampson S.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 2002-2012PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, LPC-induced glucose uptake was found to be significantly blocked by rottlerin and by the overexpression of DN-PKCδ. In contrast, pretreatment with Gö6976 (a conventional PKC inhibitor) and the expression of DN-PKCζ were found to have no effect on LPC-induced glucose uptake. These findings suggest that only PKCδ is required for LPC-induced glucose transport in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. However, it has not been established whether PKCδ is downstream of LPC receptors like G2A or GPR4, and thus, additional work is needed to further elucidate the natures of the signal mechanisms that trigger specific PKCδs to participate in LPC-induced glucose transport. The induction of insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells is a physiological function of LPC (32.Soga T. Ohishi T. Matsui T. Saito T. Matsumoto M. Takasaki J. Matsumoto S. Kamohara M. Hiyama H. Yoshida S. Momose K. Ueda Y. Matsushime H. Kobori M. Furuichi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 326: 744-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Recently, Suga et al. found that LPC induced insulin secretion by a pancreatic β-cell line (NIT-1) and by perfused rat pancreas under high glucose conditions (16.6 mm), but not under low glucose (2.8 mm) conditions (32.Soga T. Ohishi T. Matsui T. Saito T. Matsumoto M. Takasaki J. Matsumoto S. Kamohara M. Hiyama H. Yoshida S. Momose K. Ueda Y. Matsushime H. Kobori M. Furuichi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 326: 744-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). In the present study, we measured serum insulin levels in fasted mice with blood glucose concentrations of 3–5 mm after LPC administration and found that LPC had no effect. On the other hand, we found that LPC had a blood glucose lowering effect in STZ-treated insulin-deficient mice. Thus, these results obtained in our study potentially support that LPC can directly affect glucose lowering in mice. It is well known that LPA can be produced abundantly from LPC by autotoxin, which has lysophospholipase D activity (33.van Meeteren L.A. Moolenaar W.H. Prog. Lipid Res. 2007; 46: 145-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), and recently, it was reported that LPA has a glucose regulatory function (34.Yea K. Kim J. Lim S. Park H.S. Park K.S. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. J. Mol. Med. 2008; 86: 211-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been reported that LPA can associate with four types of LPA receptors, enhance glucose uptake by 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and reduce blood glucose levels by interacting with LPA1 or LPA3 receptors (34.Yea K. Kim J. Lim S. Park H.S. Park K.S. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. J. Mol. Med. 2008; 86: 211-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 35.Goetzl E.J. An S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1589-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). In addition, the authors showed that blood glucose reductions by LPA were significantly inhibited by Ki16425 (a selective LPA1 and LPA3 antagonist) (34.Yea K. Kim J. Lim S. Park H.S. Park K.S. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. J. Mol. Med. 2008; 86: 211-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether the blood glucose lowering effect of LPC is affected by Ki16425. However, although we found that the glucose lowering effect of LPA was blocked by Ki16425, it had no effect on the glucose reduction induced by LPC (Fig. 6d). Based on this result, we suggest that the LPC-induced glucose level reductions are not caused by LPA metabolized from LPC, but rather that these reductions are due to the direct effects of LPC. The physiologic concentrations of LPC in body fluids, such as blood and ascites, are substantial (5–180 μm) (14.Xu Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1582: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The levels of LPC are elevated in many diseases related to inflammation (15.Xu Y. Fang X.J. Casey G. Mills G.B. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 933-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). More recently, elevated LPC levels (in particular, the ratios of palmitoyl-LPC to linoleoyl-LPC) have been reported in ovarian cancer and multiple myeloma. Nevertheless, the changes in LPC concentration by glucose or other metabolic stimuli have not been characterized. Therefore, additional work is required on the regulation of LPC secretion and to confirm the effect of LPC on glucose metabolism. The present study provides the first evidence that blood-borne LPC is intimately involved in glucose homeostasis. It is our hope that this finding generates interest in the physiological and pathological roles of LPC in glucose metabolism. Finally, we believe that an understanding of the mechanism responsible for the metabolic effects of LPC could lead to the development of a novel means of treating diabetes.

In platelets, tyrosine phosphorylation of the Fc receptor γ-chain, linked to GPVI via Src family kinases, leads to a cascade of protein phosphorylation events, cumulating in the activation of phospholipase Cγ2 (PLCγ2). This key effector enzyme triggers many downstream events, including production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3), mobilization of cytosolic Ca2+, activation of integrin αIIbβ3, secretion of platelet granules loaded with autocrine-stimulating agents (ADP and ATP), and exposure of negatively charged phosphatidylserine (PS) at the platelet surface to ensure coagulation (1.Nieswandt B.

Ikeda Y. Handa M. Blood. 2003; 102: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Evidence for this role came from the finding that, in platelets stimulated with GPVI agonists, the p85α regulatory subunit of PI3K coprecipitates with the Fc receptor γ-chain and the LAT adaptor protein (8.Gibbins J.M. Briddon S. Shutes A. van Vugt M.J. van de Winkel J.G. Saito T. Watson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34437-34443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The p85α subunit pulls p110 catalytic subunits to the membrane, where they catalyze the formation of 3-phosphorylated inositol phospholipids, primarily the phosphoinositide 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3) (10.Pasquet J.M. Bobe R. Gross B. Gratacap M.P. Tomlinson M.G. Payrastre B. Watson S.P. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 171-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Currently, there is evidence that individual class I PI3K isoforms, which are distinguished according to their catalytic subunits, have specific cellular and physiological functions. For instance, the p110α isoform (PI3Kα) has been implicated in oncogenesis, and isoform-selective PI3Kα inhibitors can reduce tumor formation (12.Stephens L. Williams R. Hawkins P. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2005; 5: 357-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The p110γ isoform (PI3Kγ) is involved in innate immunity and various inflammatory diseases (13.Rückle T. Schwarz M.K. Rommel C. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2006; 5: 913-918Crossref Scopus (216) Google Scholar), whereas p110δ has a more important role in adaptive immunity, e.g. in T and B cells (14.Ali K. Bilancio A. Thomas M. Pearce W. Gilfillan A.M. Tkaczyk C. Kuehn N. Gray A. Giddings J. Peskett E. Fox R. Bruce I. Walker C. Sawyer C. Okkenhaug K. Finan P. Vanhaesebroeck B. Nature. 2004; 431: 1007-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Human and mouse platelets contain four different PI3K isoforms, among which are the class IA catalytic subunits, p110α, -β, and -δ (PI3Kα, -β, and -δ), and the class IB catalytic subunit, p110γ (PI3Kγ) (15.Rittenhouse S.E. Blood. 1996; 88: 4401-4414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 239-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar, 17.Jackson S.P.

For class IA, the corresponding regulatory subunits are p85α/β, p55α/γ, and p50α, whereas for class IB the regulatory subunit is p101γ. Structural studies in other cells have indicated that the regulatory class IA subunits, particularly p85α, can interact with tyrosine kinase-linked receptors via the SH2 domains (18.Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3538) Google Scholar). In contrast, class IB isoforms may rather interact with G-protein-coupled receptors (16.Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 239-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). This concept was recently challenged by the observation that, in platelets, both PI3Kβ and -γ are activated via the P2Y12 receptor for ADP, which is coupled to Gi, and that both isoforms contribute to integrin αIIbβ3 activation and platelet aggregation (17.Jackson S.P.

To date, it is debated which of the PI3K isoforms become directly activated by GPVI signaling, and which are activated indirectly, e.g. following ADP receptor stimulation. Also unclear is which are the downstream events mediated by the various isoforms. Reasons for this lack of clarity include: (i) the large contribution to GPVI-induced responses of secondary, autocrine stimulators, particularly ADP and thromboxane (1.Nieswandt B. Watson S.P.

Atkinson B.T. Pearce A.C. Wonerow P. Auger J.M. Okkenhaug K. Pearce W. Vigorito E. Vanhaesebroeck B. Turner M. Watson S.P. Platelets. 2005; 16: 191-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar); and (v) the limited availability of mice deficient in PI3K subunits. One possible, poorly explored target of PI3K in platelets is the small GTPase Rap1b, which is highly expressed in these cells and is considered to play a key role in the activation process particularly toward αIIbβ3 activation. Platelet agonists such as ADP and thrombin produce the active GTP-bound form of Rap1b, partly in a PI3K-dependent manner (27.Lova P. Paganini S. Hirsch E. Barberis L. Wymann M. Sinigaglia F.

Chem. 2002; 277: 23382-23390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Recent findings suggest that PI3Kβ is the main isoform responsible for the ADP-induced activation of Rap1b and Akt, whereas PI3Kγ contributes to αIIbβ3 activation by a separate pathway (21.Schoenwaelder S.M. Ono A. Sturgeon S. Chan S.M. Mangin P. Maxwell M.J. Turnbull S. Mulchandani M. Anderson K. Kauffenstein G. Rewcastle G.W. Kendall J. Gachet C. Salem H.H. Jackson S.P. J. Biol.

However, whether and how Rap1b is activated by GPVI is unresolved, as is the role of different PI3K isoforms herein. In the present report, we studied the identity of the PI3K isoforms downstream of GPVI and determined their role in platelet activation and thrombus formation. To discriminate between direct and indirect GPVI-induced effects, the cells were stimulated in the presence of autocrine stimulation inhibitors, blocking the signaling contributions of both ADP and thromboxane. For the studies, we combined a pharmacological approach using a panel of isoform-specific PI3K inhibitors with experiments using mice deficient in distinct PI3K catalytic or regulatory subunits. We found that PI3Kα and -β are key mediators of GPVI-induced thrombus formation and show that these isoforms affect the activity of both PLCγ2 and Rap1b. Mice deficient in the p85α regulatory PI3K subunit had a C57BL/6 genetic background (11.Watanabe N. Nakajima H. Suzuki H. Oda A. Matsubara Y. Moroi M. Terauchi Y. Kadowaki T. Suzuki H. Koyasu S.

Accumulation of InsP1 due to InsP3 production was measured with an IP-One ELISA kit from CisBio, determining InsP1 levels. Aspirin-treated platelets (1 × 108/ml) were preincubated with ADP receptor blockers, LiCl (1 mm), and Me2SO vehicle or PI3K blocker. After stimulation for 5–10 min with convulxin or thrombin, the platelets were lysed. Cell lysates were incubated with InsP1-horseradish peroxidase conjugate and anti-InsP1 monoclonal antibody, according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Blood samples were preincubated with PI3K inhibitor or Me2SO vehicle for 10 min. Blood was flowed through a transparent, parallel-plate flow chamber, containing a collagen-coated coverslip, at a defined shear rate for 4 min. The thrombi in flow chambers were stained by rinse with Hepes buffer, pH 7.45, supplemented with 1 unit/ml heparin, 2 mm CaCl2, and OG488-annexin A5 (1 μg/ml). Microscopic images were recorded in real-time using a Visitech imaging system, equipped with two intensified charge-coupled device cameras (34.Siljander P.R. Munnix I.C. Smethurst P.A. Deckmyn H.

Washed mouse platelets (2 × 108/ml) were incubated with 5 μm Fluo-3 acetoxymethyl ester plus 0.2 mg/ml Pluronic F-127. The dye-loaded cells were added to autologous blood (10% labeled platelets) and used for flow experiments within 1 h. Fluorescence images were recorded during high speed (5 Hz) perfusion of blood over a collagen surface (39.Auger J.M. Kuijpers M.J. Senis Y.A. Watson S.P. Heemskerk J.W. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 825-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Off-line, regions of interest representing one adhered cell were analyzed for fluorescence changes. Raw fluorescence data were converted into F/Fo values by pseudo-ratio analysis, and then into nanomolar concentrations of [Ca2+]i (40.Heemskerk J.W. Willems G.M. Rook M.B. Sage S.O. J. Physiol. 2001; 535: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). For quantification, traces from individual cells were superimposed, so that frame numbers of initial [Ca2+]i increases coincided. Differences between groups were tested with a Mann-Whitney U test or analysis of variance. Effects of inhibitors were tested with a Student's paired t test. The statistical package for social sciences was used (SPSS 15.0). Although PI3K activity has been implicated in GPVI-mediated platelet activation, it is unclear whether its role is direct or indirect, e.g. via autocrine ADP release and P2Y12 signaling. Another proposal is that PI3K may specifically stimulate GPVI-induced Ca2+ entry rather than mobilization of Ca2+ from internal stores (23.Pasquet J.M. Quek L. Stevens C. Bobe R. Huber M. Duronio V. Krystal G. Watson S.P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2793-2802Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To investigate this further, human Fura-2-loaded platelets were activated with GPVI agonist under conditions where indirect effects of autocrine stimulators (thromboxane A2 and ADP) were prevented with aspirin and a high concentration of ADP-degrading apyrase (0.6 unit/ml). When platelets were stimulated with CRP in the presence of extracellular EGTA (where Ca2+ is only mobilized from internal stores), the general PI3K inhibitor wortmannin (0.1 μm) caused ∼60% suppression of the Ca2+ signal (Fig. 1A).

https://openalex.org/W2006416785,"Background Although it is a crucial cellular process required for both normal development and to face stress conditions, the control of programmed cell death in plants is not fully understood. We previously reported the isolation of ATXR5 and ATXR6, two PCNA-binding proteins that could be involved in the regulation of cell cycle or cell death. A yeast two-hybrid screen using ATXR5 as bait captured AtIPS1, an enzyme which catalyses the committed step of myo-inositol (MI) biosynthesis. atips1 mutants form spontaneous lesions on leaves, raising the possibility that MI metabolism may play a role in the control of PCD in plants. In this work, we have characterised atips1 mutants to gain insight regarding the role of MI in PCD regulation. Methodology/Principal Findings - lesion formation in atips1 mutants depends of light intensity, is due to PCD as evidenced by TUNEL labelling of nuclei, and is regulated by phytohormones such as salicylic acid - MI and galactinol are the only metabolites whose accumulation is significantly reduced in the mutant, and supplementation of the mutant with these compounds is sufficient to prevent PCD - the transcriptome profile of the mutant is extremely similar to that of lesion mimic mutants such as cpr5, or wild-type plants infected with pathogens. Conclusion/Significance Taken together, our results provide strong evidence for the role of MI or MI derivatives in the regulation of PCD. Interestingly, there are three isoforms of IPS in Arabidopsis, but AtIPS1 is the only one harbouring a nuclear localisation sequence, suggesting that nuclear pools of MI may play a specific role in PCD regulation and opening new research prospects regarding the role of MI in the prevention of tumorigenesis. Nevertheless, the significance of the interaction between AtIPS1 and ATXR5 remains to be established."
https://openalex.org/W2112329962,"The low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) is a multi-ligand receptor abundantly expressed in neurons. Previous work has shown that brain LRP1 levels are decreased during aging and in Alzheimer disease. Although mounting evidence has demonstrated a role for LRP1 in the metabolism of apolipoprotein E/lipoprotein and amyloid-beta peptide, whether LRP1 also plays a direct role in neuronal survival is not clear. Here, we show that LRP1 expression is critical for the survival of primary neurons under stress conditions including trophic withdrawal, the presence of apoptosis inducers, or amyloid-beta-induced neurotoxicity. Using lentiviral short hairpin RNA to knock down endogenous LRP1 expression, we showed that a depletion of LRP1 leads to an activation of caspase-3 and increased neuronal apoptosis, an effect that was rescued by a caspase-3 inhibitor. A correlation between decreased Akt phosphorylation and the activation of caspase-3 was demonstrated in LRP1 knocked down neurons. Notably, LRP1 knockdown decreased insulin receptor levels in primary neurons, suggesting that decreased neuronal survival might be a consequence of an impaired insulin receptor signaling pathway. Correspondingly, both insulin receptor and phospho-Akt levels were decreased in LRP1 forebrain knock-out mice. These results demonstrate that LRP1 mediates anti-apoptotic function in neurons by regulating insulin receptor and the Akt survival pathway and suggest that restoring LRP1 expression in Alzheimer disease brain might be beneficial to inhibiting neurodegeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2127026096,"Although humpback whales are among the best-studied of the large whales, population boundaries in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) have remained largely untested. We assess population structure of SH humpback whales using 1,527 samples collected from whales at fourteen sampling sites within the Southwestern and Southeastern Atlantic, the Southwestern Indian Ocean, and Northern Indian Ocean (Breeding Stocks A, B, C and X, respectively). Evaluation of mtDNA population structure and migration rates was carried out under different statistical frameworks. Using all genetic evidence, the results suggest significant degrees of population structure between all ocean basins, with the Southwestern and Northern Indian Ocean most differentiated from each other. Effective migration rates were highest between the Southeastern Atlantic and the Southwestern Indian Ocean, followed by rates within the Southeastern Atlantic, and the lowest between the Southwestern and Northern Indian Ocean. At finer scales, very low gene flow was detected between the two neighbouring sub-regions in the Southeastern Atlantic, compared to high gene flow for whales within the Southwestern Indian Ocean. Our genetic results support the current management designations proposed by the International Whaling Commission of Breeding Stocks A, B, C, and X as four strongly structured populations. The population structure patterns found in this study are likely to have been influenced by a combination of long-term maternally directed fidelity of migratory destinations, along with other ecological and oceanographic features in the region."
https://openalex.org/W1992900177,"TRPC5 forms non-selective cation channels. Here we studied the role of internal Ca(2+) in the activation of murine TRPC5 heterologously expressed in human embryonic kidney cells. Cell dialysis with various Ca(2+) concentrations (Ca(2+)(i)) revealed a dose-dependent activation of TRPC5 channels by internal Ca(2+) with EC(50) of 635.1 and 358.2 nm at negative and positive membrane potentials, respectively. Stepwise increases of Ca(2+)(i) induced by photolysis of caged Ca(2+) showed that the Ca(2+) activation of TRPC5 channels follows a rapid exponential time course with a time constant of 8.6 +/- 0.2 ms at Ca(2+)(i) below 10 microM, suggesting that the action of internal Ca(2+) is a primary mechanism in the activation of TRPC5 channels. A second slow activation phase with a time to peak of 1.4 +/- 0.1 s was also observed at Ca(2+)(i) above 10 microM. In support of a Ca(2+)-activation mechanism, the thapsigargin-induced release of Ca(2+) from internal stores activated TRPC5 channels transiently, and the subsequent Ca(2+) entry produced a sustained TRPC5 activation, which in turn supported a long-lasting membrane depolarization. By co-expressing STIM1 plus ORAI1 or the alpha(1)C and beta(2) subunits of L-type Ca(2+) channels, we found that Ca(2+) entry through either calcium-release-activated-calcium or voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channels is sufficient for TRPC5 channel activation. The Ca(2+) entry activated TRPC5 channels under buffering of internal Ca(2+) with EGTA but not with BAPTA. Our data support the hypothesis that TRPC5 forms Ca(2+)-activated cation channels that are functionally coupled to Ca(2+)-selective ion channels through local Ca(2+) increases beneath the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2048171416,"Adaptive laser pulse shaping has enabled impressive control over photophysical processes in complex molecules. However, the optimal pulse shape that emerges rarely offers straightforward insight into the excited-state properties being manipulated. We have shown that the emission quantum yield of a donor-acceptor macromolecule (a phenylene ethynylene dendrimer tethered to perylene) can be enhanced by 15% through iterative phase modulation of the excitation pulse. Furthermore, by analyzing the pulse optimization process and optimal pulse features, we successfully isolated the dominant elements underlying the control mechanism. We demonstrated that a step function in the spectral phase directs the postexcitation dynamics of the donor moiety, thus characterizing the coherent nature of the donor excited state. An accompanying pump-probe experiment implicates a 2+1 photon control pathway, in which the optimal pulse promotes a delayed excitation to a second excited state through favorable quantum interference."
https://openalex.org/W1974845262,"Vibrio cholerae colonizes the small intestine of adult C57BL/6 mice. In this study, the physical and genetic parameters that facilitate this colonization were investigated. Successful colonization was found to depend upon anesthesia with ketamine-xylazine and neutralization of stomach acid with sodium bicarbonate, but not streptomycin treatment. A variety of common mouse strains were colonized by O1, O139, and non-O1/non-O139 strains. All combinations of mutants in the genes for hemolysin, the multifunctional, autoprocessing RTX toxin (MARTX), and hemagglutinin/protease were assessed, and it was found that hemolysin and MARTX are each sufficient for colonization after a low dose infection. Overall, this study suggests that, after intragastric inoculation, V. cholerae encounters barriers to infection including an acidic environment and an immediate immune response that is circumvented by sodium bicarbonate and the anti-inflammatory effects of ketamine-xylazine. After initial adherence in the small intestine, the bacteria are subjected to additional clearance mechanisms that are evaded by the independent toxic action of hemolysin or MARTX. Once colonization is established, it is suggested that, in humans, these now persisting bacteria initiate synthesis of the major virulence factors to cause cholera disease. This adult mouse model of intestinal V. cholerae infection, now well-characterized and fully optimized, should serve as a valuable tool for studies of pathogenesis and testing vaccine efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W2056599855,"We investigated the regulatory effects of GRK2 on D(2) dopamine receptor signaling and found that this kinase inhibits both receptor expression and functional signaling in a phosphorylation-independent manner, apparently through different mechanisms. Overexpression of GRK2 was found to suppress receptor expression at the cell surface and enhance agonist-induced internalization, whereas short interfering RNA knockdown of endogenous GRK2 led to an increase in cell surface receptor expression and decreased agonist-mediated endocytosis. These effects were not due to GRK2-mediated phosphorylation of the D(2) receptor as a phosphorylation-null receptor mutant was regulated similarly, and overexpression of a catalytically inactive mutant of GRK2 produced the same effects. The suppression of receptor expression is correlated with constitutive association of GRK2 with the receptor complex as we found that GRK2 and several of its mutants were able to co-immunoprecipitate with the D(2) receptor. Agonist pretreatment did not enhance the ability of GRK2 to co-immunoprecipitate with the receptor. We also found that overexpression of GRK2 attenuated the functional coupling of the D(2) receptor and that this activity required the kinase activity of GRK2 but did not involve receptor phosphorylation, thus suggesting the involvement of an additional GRK2 substrate. Interestingly, we found that the suppression of functional signaling also required the G betagamma binding activity of GRK2 but did not involve the GRK2 N-terminal RH domain. Our results suggest a novel mechanism by which GRK2 negatively regulates G protein-coupled receptor signaling in a manner that is independent of receptor phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2158220148,"Secretins are an unusual and important class of bacterial outer membrane (OM) proteins. They are involved in the transport of single proteins or macromolecular structures such as pili, needle complexes, and bacteriophages across the OM. Secretins are multimeric ring-shaped structures that form large pores in the OM. The targeting of such macromolecular structures to the OM often requires special assistance, conferred by specific pilotins or pilot proteins. Here, we investigated HxcQ, the OM component of the second Pseudomonas aeruginosa type II secretion system. We found that HxcQ forms high molecular mass structures resistant to heat and SDS, revealing its secretin nature. Interestingly, we showed that HxcQ is a lipoprotein. Construction of a recombinant nonlipidated HxcQ (HxcQnl) revealed that lipidation is essential for HxcQ function. Further phenotypic analysis indicated that HxcQnl accumulates as multimers in the inner membrane of P. aeruginosa, a typical phenotype observed for secretins in the absence of their cognate pilotin. Our observations led us to the conclusion that the lipid anchor of HxcQ plays a pilotin role. The self-piloting of HxcQ to the OM was further confirmed by its correct multimeric OM localization when expressed in the heterologous host Escherichia coli.

At least six different secretion pathways have evolved in these bacteria for the secretion of a very diverse pool of extracellular proteins (1.Filloux A. Biochim. Biophys.

Among them, the type II secretion pathway is a two-step process in which exoproteins with an N-terminal signal peptide (SP) are first exported through the cytoplasmic membrane by either the Sec or Tat translocons. Following removal of the SP, they are released into the periplasm (3.Pugsley A.P. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 50-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Voulhoux R. Ball G. Ize B. Vasil M.L. Lazdunski A. Wu L.F. Filloux A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6735-6741Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The periplasmic intermediates are specifically recognized by the type II secretion system (T2SS), also called secreton, for their transport across the OM. This pathway, therefore, promotes the specific transport of exoproteins requiring intracellular folding, like periplasmic disulfide bridge formation, and, in some cases, assembly into multimeric complexes prior to their secretion. Such a requirement implies that the secretion process uses a large and tightly controlled secretion channel in the OM. The T2SS is a highly complex nanomachine embedded in the bacterial envelope consisting of 12–16 different proteins, depending on the organism (1.Filloux A. Biochim. Biophys.

Interestingly, there is only one integral OM protein in this system, which therefore constitutes the only candidate for the OM translocation channel. This OM component belongs to a family of proteins generically designated as secretins (6.Bitter W. Arch. Microbiol. 2003; 179: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This family also includes members that are involved in type III protein secretion (T3SS), type IV pilus assembly, type IV bundle-forming pili, toxin co-regulated pili, and assembly and export of filamentous phage (7.Bitter W.

Therefore, secretins constitute an important group of transporters specialized in the translocation of bulky macromolecules or macromolecular complexes across the OM. outer membrane type II secretion system inner membrane 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid high molecular mass signal peptide. Several secretins have been purified and analyzed by electron microscopy, revealing that 12–14 identical secretin monomers form ring-like complexes with a central channel large enough to accommodate their substrates (7.Bitter W.

The homology between the members of the secretin family is contained within the C-terminal half of the protein (see Fig. 2) (15.Genin S. Boucher C.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 243: 112-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Therefore, this domain has been proposed to form the secretion channel, whereas the much less conserved N-terminal domain that largely protrudes into the periplasm probably undertakes more specific functions, such as substrate recognition and/or interaction with the other components of the corresponding machineries (13.Chami M. Guilvout I. Gregorini M. Rémigy H.W. Müller S.A. Valerio M. Engel A. Pugsley A.P. Bayan N. J. Biol.

Among the large diversity of identified secretins, most of them depend on a small pilot protein for their correct final insertion into the outer membrane. In most cases, pilot proteins are outer membrane-linked lipoproteins called pilotins. To date, characterized secretin/pilotin couples are: PulD/PulS of Klebsiella (17.Hardie K.R. Seydel A. Guilvout I. Pugsley A.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 967-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 18.Hardie K.R. Lory S. Pugsley A.P.

Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 5366-5375Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), InvG/InvH of Salmonella (12.Crago A.M. Koronakis V. Mol.

Microbiol. 2006; 60: 16-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) for Type IV pilus systems. For T2SS secretin/pilotin couples, the specific pilotin binding domain is localized at the extreme C terminus of the secretin (19.Shevchik V.E. Condemine G. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 3219-3228Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 22.Daefler S. Guilvout I. Hardie K.R. Pugsley A.P. Russel M. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The majority of the genes encoding pilotins are found in the same cluster as the genes encoding the corresponding secretion systems. However, in several secretin-containing systems, a pilotin gene has yet to be identified, suggesting the existence of possible alternatives to the pilotin biogenesis pathway. Recently, a soluble nonlipidated periplasmic protein has been shown to be important for the OM localization of XcpQ secretin in P. aeruginosa (23.Seo J. Brencic A. Darwin A.J. J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 898-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Interestingly, three secretins are themselves lipoproteins, but no function has so far been attributed to their atypical N-terminal lipid anchor. One, XpsD of Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris, belongs to a T2SS (24.Hu N.T. Hung M.N. Liao C.T. Lin M.H. Microbiology. 1995; 141: 1395-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and two others, BfpB of enteropathogenic E. coli (25.Schmidt S.A. Bieber D. Ramer S.W. Hwang J. Wu C.Y. Schoolnik G. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4848-4859Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and TcpC of Vibrio cholerae (11.Bose N. Taylor R.K. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 2225-2232Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) are members of type IV pili systems. In Gram-negative bacteria, most lipoproteins are periplasmic proteins anchored to the inner or outer membrane through a lipid moiety attached to their invariable N-terminal cysteine residue (3.Pugsley A.P. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 50-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lipidation and maturation of lipoproteins take place after their translocation through the inner membrane via Sec machinery (3.Pugsley A.P. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 50-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lipoprotein-specific signal peptides (SPs) are characterized by a specific consensus motif (V/L)XXC called the Lipobox (26.Sankaran K. Wu H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19701-19706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Lipobox is both the lipidation site and the maturation site recognized by the lipoprotein signal peptidase II, which cleaves the SP upstream of the cysteine (27.Yamaguchi K. Yu F. Inouye M. Cell. 1988; 53: 423-432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 28.Seydel A. Gounon P. Pugsley A.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 810-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). P. aeruginosa strain PAO1 possesses two complete and nonredundant T2SS, referred to as the Xcp and Hxc systems (1.Filloux A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1694: 163-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). While more than a dozen exoproteins utilize the Xcp T2SS for their secretion, the Hxc T2SS, which is induced under phosphate starvation, is dedicated to the secretion of one single low molecular mass protein, the alkaline phosphatase LapA (29.Ball G. Durand E. Lazdunski A. Filloux A. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 475-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In the present work, we reveal that the atypical HxcQ secretin of the Hxc T2SS of P. aeruginosa is a lipoprotein. Moreover, we demonstrate that the HxcQ liposecretin is self-piloted to the OM via its N-terminal lipid anchor, therefore revealing a new pathway for secretin biogenesis. The bacterial strains, vectors, and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1. Recombinant DNA methods were performed essentially as described previously (30.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.in: Nolan C. 2nd Ed. C. S. H. L. Press, New York1989: 1.2-1.110Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides used for PCR are listed Table 2. P. aeruginosa and E. coli strains were grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium. To induce LapA production and secretion via the P. aeruginosa Hxc T2SS, cells were grown at 30 °C under phosphate-limiting conditions using proteose peptone medium (Difco Laboratories) containing 0.4% glucose, with horizontal shaking (29.Ball G. Durand E. Lazdunski A. Filloux A. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 475-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). When required, media were supplemented with the following antibiotics used at the indicated concentrations: 50 μg·ml−1 kanamycin, 20 μg·ml−1 gentamicin; and 50 μg·ml−1 ampicillin; 50 μg·ml−1 for E. coli and 250 μg·ml−1 carbenicillin; 50 μg·ml−1 gentamycin; and 2,000 μg·ml−1 streptomycin for P. aeruginosa. Bacterial growth was measured by optical density at 600 nm (A600). 1 A600 unit corresponds to 109 cells/ml. The E. coli CC118λpir strain was used to propagate pKNG101 and derivative plasmids, while TG1 and the DH5α strains were used for other plasmid manipulations. Plasmids were transferred to P. aeruginosa using the conjugative properties of the helper plasmid pRK2013 in triparental matings (31.Figurski D.H. Helinski D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1979; 76: 1648-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (2480) Google Scholar). Transconjugants were selected on Pseudomonas isolation agar (Difco) containing 2.5% glycerol (v/v) supplemented with corresponding antibiotic(s). For classical arabinose induction, bacterial cultures were induced with 0.2% filtered l-arabinose (Sigma) at A600 0.8 for 2.5 h.TABLE 1Strains and plasmids used in this studyStrains, vectors, and plasmidsRelevant characteristicsSource or Ref.StrainsE. coliTG1SupE Δ(lac-proAB) thi hsd RΔ5 (F':traD36 rpo A+B+ lacIq lacZΔM15)Lab collectionDH5αsupE44 hsdR17 recA1 endA1 gyrA96 thi-1 relA1Lab collectionCC118λpirΔ(ara-leu) araD ΔlacX74 galE galK phoA20 thi-1 rpsE rpoB argE(Am) recA1 RfR(λpir)Ref. 46.Herrero M. de Lorenzo V.

Bos M.P. Geurtsen J. Mols M. Tommassen J. Science. 2003; 299: 262-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Protein samples were solubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (33.Lugtenberg B. Meijers J. Peters R. van der Hoek P. van Alphen L. FEBS Lett. 1975; 58: 254-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar) containing 2% SDS and mercaptoethanol (denaturing) or 0.2% SDS without mercaptoethanol (semi-native). Samples were heated for 10 min at 95 °C (denaturing) or stored at 4 °C (semi-native). Electrophoresis was performed using 11% SDS-polyacrylamide gel at room temperature and 25 mA/gel (denaturing) or 3.5–9% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide-free gel at 4 °C and 100 V (semi-native conditions) or a different percentage of polyacrylamide when indicated. For Western blotting, proteins were transferred from gels onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked overnight in Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.6), 5% milk, and 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated with primary antibodies directed against the V5 epitope (Bethyl/Interchim), LapA (laboratory stock), TolR (laboratory stock), XcpY and XcpR (laboratory stock), HxcQ (EUROGENTEC peptides based polyclonal antibody protocol (AS-DOUB-LXP), peptide 28 (H2N-GGEGNEGDQQRARLSG-CONH2) for specific multimer detection, and peptide 29 (H2N-SSVDERASTAAGVC-CONH2) for specific monomer detection in blocking buffer, followed by a second incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (A6154, Sigma) in blocking buffer. Membranes were developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence protocol (Pierce). P. aeruginosa strains were grown under phosphate-limiting conditions to an A600 of 1.5. Cells and extracellular medium were separated by centrifugation; proteins contained in the supernatants were precipitated by adding trichloroacetic acid (10% (w/v) final concentration) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Samples were subsequently centrifuged (30 min at 15,000 × g), the pellets were washed with 90% (v/v) acetone, resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and analyzed under denaturing conditions. Bacteria were grown in Luria-Bertani medium to an A600 of 0.8, and arabinose at 0.2% final and globomycin at 100 μg·ml−1 final were added to the culture, and incubation was continued for 30 min at 37 °C. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in SDS sample buffer, and solubilized proteins were examined by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Bacteria were grown at 37 °C in a liquid minimal medium, proteose peptone 1× (supplemented with 0.4% glucose as carbon source) to an A600 of 0.3. Gene expression was induced with 0.2% l-arabinose. At the same time, 50 μCi of [3H]-palmitic acid was added to 1 ml of the culture. Cells were grown for 150 min and collected, and total proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Gels were then either dried on filter paper and subjected to autoradiography for 5 months at −80 °C and revealed or blotted for HxcQ detection. 250 A600 units equivalent of bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation at 2,000 × g. The pellet was resuspended in 1.5 ml buffer A (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm p-toluenesulfonyl fluoride (Sigma-Aldrich); 10 μg·ml−1 DNase and RNase (Roche); and sucrose 20% (w/w)). The cells were passed twice through a French press cell disrupter (Thermo) at 15,000 pressure units using a 3/8-inch diameter piston (20K French pressure cell, AMINCO). Unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 4 °C for 15 min at 1,600 × g. The supernatant was centrifuged at 4 °C for 30 min at 125,000 × g. The crude membrane pellet was resuspended in 0.5 ml buffer M (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, “Complete EDTA-free” proteases inhibitor mixture (Roche) and 5 mm EDTA) containing 20% (w/w) sucrose and then loaded on top of a discontinuous sucrose gradient consisting of 1.5 ml layers of buffer M solution containing 60 (bottom), 55, 50, 45, 40, 35, and 30% (w/w) sucrose. The membrane separation was performed by centrifugation at 4 °C for 65 h at 39,000 rpm in a Beckman SW41 rotor. The gradients were visually checked, and predicted inner membrane (IM) (upper disc) and OM (lower disc) fractions were collected for experiments as presented (Fig. 5A). Fractions were electrophoresed in (i) 11% denaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gel followed by Coomassie Blue staining and visual identification of the OM protein OprF; (ii) 11% denaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gel followed by Western blotting for XcpY detection; (iii) 3.5–9% gradient seminative polyacrylamide gel followed by Western blotting with antibody against HxcQ peptide 28 for detection of multimers of secretins; and (iv) 9% denaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gel followed by Western blotting with antibody against HxcQ peptide 29 for detection of monomers of secretins. 500 A600 units equivalent of bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation at 2,000 × g. The pellet was resuspended in 5 ml of buffer B (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4; 1 mm p-toluenesulfonyl fluoride; 10 μg·ml−1 DNase and RNase (Roche); sucrose 20% (w/w); and 400 μg·ml−1 lysozyme (Euromedex)). The cells were passed twice through a French press cell disrupter (Thermo) at 15,000 pressure units using a 3/8-inch diameter piston (20K French pressure cell, AMINCO). Unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 4 °C for 15 min at 1,600 × g. The supernatant was centrifuged at 4 °C for 30 min at 125,000 × g. The crude membrane pellet was resuspended in 0.5 ml buffer M (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4; “Complete EDTA-free” proteases inhibitor mixture (Roche), and 5 mm EDTA), containing 20% (w/w) sucrose and then loaded on top of a discontinuous sucrose gradient consisting of 1.5 ml layers of buffer M solution containing 60 (bottom), 55, 50, 45, 40, 35, and 30% (w/w) sucrose. The membrane separation was performed by centrifugation at 4 °C for 18 h at 39,000 rpm in a Beckman SW41 rotor. The gradient was further collected in 16 fractions of about 550 μl each. Fractions were electrophoresed in 3.5–11% denaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gel followed by (i) Coomassie Blue staining and visual identification of the OM porins; and (ii) Western blotting for TolR, HxcQ monomers, and multimers detection. NADH oxidase activity measurement was carried out essentially as described by Osborn et al. (51.Osborn H.J. Gander J.E. Parisi E. Carson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 3962-3972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, incubation mixtures containing 50 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.4, 0,12 mm β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, reduced form (NADH) disodium salt hydrate (Sigma, N-8129), and 0.2 mm dithiothreitol (Sigma, D-0632), and the membrane fractions (20 μl) in a final volume of 200 μl were prepared. The rate of decrease in absorbance at 340 nm was measured in microplates at 23 °C in a Multiskan Ascent recording spectrophotometer (Thermo Labsystems). The equivalent of 10 A600 units of a crude membrane pellet (obtained following the density sucrose gradient protocol) was resuspended in 500 μl of either 2% Triton X-100 (w/v) (T-9284, Sigma) solution, 100 mm sodium carbonate pH 11 (S-6139 Sigma) solution, or 4 m urea (161-0731, Bio-Rad) in 20 mm MES, 99% (M-3023, Sigma) solution. Samples were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with gentle shaking. Soluble and insoluble membrane proteins were separated by centrifugation at 4 °C for 30 min at 125,000 × g. Insoluble membrane proteins were recovered in the pellet fraction, whereas solubilized membrane proteins present in the soluble fraction were precipitated by adding tRNA (100 μg·ml−1 final) and trichloroacetic acid (10% (w/v) final) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Samples were subsequently centrifuged (30 min at 15,000 × g), and the pellets washed with 90% acetone. Pellets containing insoluble or precipitated soluble membrane proteins were resuspended in denaturing or seminative SDS-PAGE sample buffer for SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. P. aeruginosa strains were grown exponentially for 2 h in the presence of 0.2% l-arabinose and harvested by centrifugation at room temperature. The transmembrane potential (Δψ) was measured essentially as described previously (34.Cascales E. Christie P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 17228-17233Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cell pellet from two A600 units was resuspended in 100 μl of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, and 1 mm EDTA for outer membrane permeabilization and incubated for 3 min at 37 °C. The cell suspension was then diluted 20-fold in the transport buffer (100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, 1 mm KCl, and 0.4% glycerol). A tritiated triphenylphosphonium bromide (Br-TPP) solution ([3H]Br-TPP; Amersham Biosciences; diluted 40-fold in 2 mm cold Br-TPP) was added at the final concentration of 10 μm in 200 μl of the cell suspension and further incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. Cells were recovered by filtration (Whatman) and washed twice with transport buffer and once with transport buffer without glycerol. As a control for nonspecific TPP binding, cell aliquots were first incubated with 10 μm of carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone for 15 min at room temperature before addition of the Br-TPP solution, incubation, and filtration. Among the different T2SS Hxc proteins encoded by the hxc cluster, HxcQ is predicted to be the secretin component of the system (29.Ball G. Durand E. Lazdunski A. Filloux A. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 475-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). As presented in Fig. 1, HxcQ forms SDS-resistant high molecular mass (HMM) complexes, which has been shown to be a general characteristic of secretins. We observed such HMM complexes for HxcQ secretin when total cell fractions of P. aeruginosa ΔhxcQ producing a C-terminal V5-hexahistidine tagged HxcQ (HxcQV5) were loaded on a standard SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 1). However, secretin complexes can show different behaviors in response to heat treatment. For example, HMM complexes formed by PulD or pIV secretins are fully resistant to heat (18.Hardie K.R. Lory S. Pugsley A.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 978-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 35.Linderoth N.A. Model P. Russel M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1962-1970Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas HMM complexes formed by XcpQ, BfpB, TcpC, or OutD secretins are totally dissociated after boiling (7.Bitter W. Koster M. Latijnhouwers M. de Cock H. Tommassen J. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 209-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 10.Daniel A. Singh A. Crowther L.J. Fernandes P.J. Schreiber W. Donnenberg M.S.

We found that HxcQ multimers are partially heat-resistant even when samples are incubated at up to 95 °C for 10 min (Fig. 1, lane 4). HxcQ secretin encodes an 803-amino acid protein that is 30% identical and 49% similar to XcpQ, a well characterized T2SS secretin of P. aeruginosa. HxcQ primary sequence analysis revealed the typical two subdomains found in XcpQ, the highly conserved C-terminal domain (residues 424–803) involved in pore formation, and the dissimilar N-terminal domain (residues 81–362), predicted to be periplasmic (Fig. 2). Primary sequence comparison between HxcQ and XcpQ also revealed the presence of two supplemental linker regions on both sides of HxcQ N-terminal domain that are absent in XcpQ (Fig. 2).

Combinations of CD40 and TLR stimulation can be synergistic, resulting in even stronger dendritic cell (DC) and CD8+ T cell responses. To evaluate such combinations, established B16F10 melanoma tumors were injected every other day X 5 with plasmid DNA encoding a multimeric, soluble form of CD40L (pSP-D-CD40L) either alone or combined with an agonist for TLR1/2 (Pam(3)CSK(4) ), TLR2/6 (FSL-1 and MALP2), TLR3 (polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid, poly(I:C)), TLR4 ( monophosphoryl lipid A, MPL), TLR7 (imiquimod), or TLR9 (Class B CpG phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide, CpG). When used by itself, pSP-D-CD40L slowed tumor growth and prolonged survival, but did not lead to cure. Of the TLR agonists, CpG and poly(I:C) also slowed tumor growth, and the combination of these two TLR agonists was more effective than either agent alone. The triple combination of intratumoral pSP-D-CD40L + CpG + poly(I:C) markedly slowed tumor growth and prolonged survival. This treatment was associated with a reduction in intratumoral CD11c+ dendritic cells and an influx of CD8+ T cells. Since intratumoral injection of plasmid DNA does not lead to efficient transgene expression, pSP-D-CD40L was also tested with cationic polymers that form DNA-containing nanoparticles which lead to enhanced intratumoral gene expression. Intratumoral injections of pSP-D-CD40L-containing nanoparticles formed from polyethylenimine (PEI) or C32 (a novel biodegradable poly(B-amino esters) polymer) in combination with CpG + poly(I:C) had dramatic antitumor effects and frequently cured mice of B16F10 tumors. These data confirm and extend previous reports that CD40 and TLR agonists are synergistic and demonstrate that this combination of immunostimulants can significantly suppress tumor growth in mice. In addition, the enhanced effectiveness of nanoparticle formulations of DNA encoding immunostimulatory molecules such as multimeric, soluble CD40L supports the further study of this technology for tumor immunotherapy."

https://openalex.org/W2104293024,"The formin protein formin-like 1 (FMNL1) is highly restrictedly expressed in hematopoietic lineage-derived cells and has been previously identified as a tumor-associated antigen. However, function and regulation of FMNL1 are not well defined. We have identified a novel splice variant (FMNL1gamma) containing an intron retention at the C terminus affecting the diaphanous autoinhibitory domain (DAD). FMNL1gamma is specifically located at the cell membrane and cortex in diverse cell lines. Similar localization of FMNL1 was observed for a mutant lacking the DAD domain (FMNL1DeltaDAD), indicating that deregulation of autoinhibition is effective in FMNL1gamma. Expression of both FMNL1gamma and FMNL1DeltaDAD induces polarized nonapoptotic blebbing that is dependent on N-terminal myristoylation of FMNL1 but independent of Src and ROCK activity. Thus, our results describe N-myristoylation as a regulative mechanism of FMNL1 responsible for membrane trafficking potentially involved in a diversity of polarized processes of hematopoietic lineage-derived cells."
https://openalex.org/W1974677280,"Seladin-1 is a neuroprotective protein selectively down-regulated in brain regions affected in Alzheimer disease (AD). Seladin-1 protects cells against beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide 42- and oxidative stress-induced apoptosis activated by caspase-3, a key mediator of apoptosis. Here, we have employed RNA interference to assess the molecular effects of seladin-1 down-regulation on the beta-secretase (BACE1) function and beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells in both normal and apoptotic conditions. Our results show that approximately 60% reduction in seladin-1 protein levels, resembling the decrease observed in AD brain, did not significantly affect APP processing or Abeta secretion in normal growth conditions. However, under apoptosis, seladin-1 small interfering RNA (siRNA)-transfected cells showed increased caspase-3 activity on average by 2-fold when compared with control siRNA-transfected cells. Increased caspase-3 activity coincided with a significant depletion of the BACE1-sorting protein, GGA3 (Golgi-localized gamma-ear-containing ADP-ribosylation factor-binding protein), and subsequently augmented BACE1 protein levels and activity. Augmented BACE1 activity in turn correlated with the enhanced beta-amyloidogenic processing of APP and ultimately increased Abeta production. These adverse changes associated with decreased cell viability in seladin-1 siRNA-transfected cells under apoptosis. No changes in GGA3 or BACE1 levels were found after seladin-1 knockdown in normal growth conditions. Collectively, our results suggest that under stress conditions, reduced seladin-1 expression results in enhanced GGA3 depletion, which further leads to augmented post-translational stabilization of BACE1 and increased beta-amyloidogenic processing of APP. These mechanistic findings related to seladin-1 down-regulation are important in the context of AD as the oxidative stress-induced apoptosis plays a key role in the disease pathogenesis."

Nature. 2006; 440: 448-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). They respond to the binding of the neurotransmitter by transiently opening an ion channel across the cell membrane. The resultant influx of ions into the cell alters the membrane potential leading to either the generation or the inhibition of an action potential.

PC-nAChR is unresponsive to agonist because it adopts an uncoupled conformation where allosteric communication between the agonist-binding and transmembrane pore domains is lost, even though both domains adopt structures suggestive of the activatable resting state (14.daCosta C.J. Baenziger J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 17819-17825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Lipids are thought to influence coupling by interacting with the highly lipid-exposed M4 transmembrane α-helix. M4 extends beyond the lipid bilayer toward the eponymous Cys loop, which is central for coupling agonist binding to channel gating (15.Bouzat C. Gumilar F. Spitzmaul G. Wang H.L. Rayes D. Hansen S.B. Taylor P. Sine S.M. Nature. 2004; 430: 896-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 16.Shen X.M. Ohno K. Tsujino A. Brengman J.M. Gingold M. Sine S.M. Engel A.G. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). M4 may act as a “lipid sensor” relaying membrane properties to the coupling interface between the agonist binding and transmembrane pore domains. By interacting preferentially with M4 in the coupled resting conformation, lipids may stabilize the resting state (14.daCosta C.J. Baenziger J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 17819-17825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Most studies suggest that the nAChR requires both anionic and neutral lipids in a PC membrane to adopt an agonist-activatable conformation (6.Fong T.M. McNamee M.G. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 830-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 11.Sunshine C. McNamee M.G. Biochim. Biophys.

Of the many natural anionic lipids, phosphatidic acid (PA) is particularly effective. High levels of PA in a PC membrane are sufficient to stabilize an agonist-activatable nAChR (9.Baenziger J.E. Morris M.L. Darsaut T.E. Ryan S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 777-784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 17.daCosta C.J. Ogrel A.A. McCardy E.A. Blanton M.P. Baenziger J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 201-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In contrast, the nAChR in a PC membrane containing the anionic lipid, phosphatidylserine (PS), is not responsive to agonist unless cholesterol (Chol) is present (18.daCosta C.J. Wagg I.D. McKay M.E. Baenziger J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14967-14974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The strikingly different efficacies of PA and PS suggest that PA imparts a unique chemical and/or physical property onto the reconstituted membranes that is required to stabilize the resting conformation. One obvious chemical difference is the charge distribution within the two lipid headgroups (Fig. 1), which could lead to essential interactions between PA and polar side chains in the resting conformation. Alternatively, the PA headgroup is much smaller than the headgroup of PS and will have a larger influence on lipid packing/bilayer physical properties (19.Kooijman E.E. Chupin V. Fuller N.L. Kozlov M.M. de Kruijff B. Burger K.N. Rand P.R. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 2097-2102Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Membrane physical properties could influence transmembrane helix:helix associations to favor the resting nAChR. The initial goal of this work was to probe the mechanism(s) by which PC/PA membranes stabilize an agonist-activatable nAChR. We examined a variety of reconstituted PC/anionic lipid membranes and found that anionic lipids with relatively small headgroup cross-sectional areas, and thus the greatest ability to influence lipid packing/bilayer physical properties, are the most effective at stabilizing an agonist-activatable resting conformation. This suggests that membrane physical properties play a role in stabilizing the resting nAChR. More importantly, we also found that the differing abilities of PC/anionic lipid membranes to stabilize an activatable nAChR stem from differing abilities to preferentially stabilize resting over both uncoupled and desensitized conformations. In other words, anionic lipids modulate multiple nAChR conformational equilibria. Our findings suggest that both lipids and membrane physical properties act as classic allosteric modulators influencing nAChR function by preferentially interacting with and thus stabilizing native conformational states. Frozen Torpedo californica electroplax tissue was obtained from Aquatic Research Consultants (San Pedro, CA). 1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PC), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (PG), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserine (PS), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoinositol (PI), and cardiolipin (tetraoleoyl) were from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Alabaster, AL). Cholesterol, ethidium bromide (EtBr), and carbamylcholine chloride (Carb) were from Sigma. The nAChR was affinity-purified on a bromoacetylcholine bromide-derivatized Affi-Gel 102 column (Bio-Rad) as described elsewhere (17.daCosta C.J. Ogrel A.A. McCardy E.A. Blanton M.P. Baenziger J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 201-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The column-bound nAChR was washed extensively with dialysis buffer (100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.02% w/v NaN3, pH 7.8) containing 1% cholate and supplemented with 3.2 mm of the desired lipid. The nAChR was then eluted from the column with a 0.13 mm lipid solution in 250 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.02% NaN3, 5 mm phosphate, pH 7.8, with 0.5% cholate and 10 mm Carb. After elution from the column, the nAChR was dialyzed five times against 2 liters of dialysis buffer with buffer change approximately once every 12 h. The final lipid composition of each membrane was assessed by thin layer chromatography as described below. The reconstituted membranes have lipid:protein ratios in the 150–300 mol/mol range, as estimated by Fourier transform infrared (20.daCosta C.J. Baenziger J.E. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and enzymatic assays (phospholipid C/choline assay, Wako Chemicals). TLCs were performed using high performance silica gel plates (60 Å, 4.5-μm particle size; Whatman) as described (14.daCosta C.J. Baenziger J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 17819-17825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), but with the following modifications. A dual solvent system was used for development to better resolve individual lipid species. Plates were initially developed halfway in a chloroform/methanol/formic acid/H2O (50:37.5:3.5:2, v/v) solvent system. After air drying, the plates were developed further in a benzene/2-propanol/ethyl acetate/formic acid (72.5:3.5:22:2) solvent system. The TLC analysis shows that each of the reconstitutions exhibited the expected PC:anionic lipid ratio, although PC/PA-nAChR contains small amounts of diacylglycerol (see supplemental Fig. S5 and supplemental discussion for details). All infrared spectra were recorded on either an FTS-575c or an FTS-40 spectrometer (Varian, Randolph, MA) as described previously (17.daCosta C.J. Ogrel A.A. McCardy E.A. Blanton M.P. Baenziger J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 201-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Both spectrometers were equipped with a DTGS detector. For the analysis of protein secondary structure, the extent of peptide hydrogen/deuterium exchange, and lipid thermotropic phase behavior, each nAChR sample was first incubated at 4 °C in 2H2O phosphate buffer for precisely 72 h to exchange peptide N-1H for N-2H. The samples were then stored at −80 °C. Prior to infrared analysis, samples were individually thawed, centrifuged, resuspended in 30 μl of 2H2O phosphate buffer, and subjected to five freeze-thaw vortex cycles. All infrared spectra were recorded in Torpedo Ringer buffer (TRB: 5 mm Tris, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 3 mm CaCl2, pH 7.0). Where necessary, trace water vapor absorptions were subtracted as described elsewhere (21.Reid S.E. Moffat D.J. Baenziger J.E. Spectrochimica Acta, Part A. 1996; 52: 1347-1356Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). All spectral deconvolution was performed using GRAMS/AI version 7.01 software (Galactic, Salem, NH). The data acquisition protocols for assessing the thermotropic phase behavior of the membranes have been described previously (17.daCosta C.J. Ogrel A.A. McCardy E.A. Blanton M.P. Baenziger J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 201-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Briefly, 128 scans at 2 cm−1 resolution were acquired at 1° intervals as the sample was cooled from 35 to −10 °C. Note that all of the 2H2O buffers were prepared by drying the corresponding H2O buffers, pH 7.0, and then rehydrating them with the appropriate volume of 2H2O. The pD values were then verified with litmus paper. Infrared difference spectra were recorded at 22.5 °C using the attenuated total reflectance technique as described in detail elsewhere (22.Baenziger J.E. Miller K.W. Rothschild K.J. Biophys. J. 1992; 61: 983-992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 23.Ryan S.E. Hill D.G. Baenziger J.E. J. Biol.

Briefly, two spectra were recorded while flowing TRB past nAChR film that was deposited on the surface of a germanium internal reflection element. The flowing buffer was switched to an identical buffer containing 50 μm Carb, and after 1 min a spectrum was recorded of the Carb-bound state. The nAChR film was then washed with TRB for 20 min to remove nAChR-bound Carb, and the data acquisition protocol was repeated. All spectra were recorded at 8 cm−1 resolution, signal-averaging 512 scans per spectrum, which takes ∼7–8 min per spectrum. Each presented difference spectrum is the average of more than 40 individual difference spectra recorded from several different reconstituted nAChR films. The difference spectra were base-line corrected between 1800 and 1000 cm−1 and were interpolated to an effective resolution of 4 cm−1. All fluorescence experiments were performed on a Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer equipped with the Cary Eclipse version 1.1 software package (Varian). The data in Figs. 4 and 5 were acquired by monitoring the fluorescence emission intensity at 590 nm as a function of time (2.0-s sampling time) while ethidium bromide was continuously excited at 500 nm (excitation and emission slits are described in the associated figure legends). The data in Fig. 6 were acquired with 530 nm excitation to enhance the emission intensity arising from nAChR-bound ethidium and reduce the intensity of the signal arising from ethidium in solution.FIGURE 5Agonist-activatable PC/PA-nAChR undergoes a rapid transient Carb-induced transition leading to increased accessibility to the ion channel pore.

At the indicated times, ∼50 nm nAChR, 500 μm Carb, and two times 500 μm dibucaine (Dib) were added to ethidium at either 1× KD (0.3 μm; lowest trace), 10× KD (3.0 μm; middle trace), or 100× KD (30 μm; top trace). The fluorescence traces are offset and shaded to improve clarity. Inset, dibucaine-displaceable ethidium fluorescence emission intensity at 590 nm in the presence (+) or absence (−) of Carb. Error bars are the mean ± S.E. for n = 6 experiments; three measurements are each from two different reconstitutions at the indicated lipid compositions except for trace iii, which is n = 3 from one reconstitution. These traces were recorded with 5 nm excitation and 20 nm emission slit widths to allow comparison of the fluorescence intensities at all three ethidium concentrations. A 530 nm excitation wavelength maximizes the fluorescence intensity arising from nAChR-bound versus solution ethidium (see under “Experimental Procedures”).

At the indicated times, 30 μg of nAChR suspended in 200 μl of TRB was added, followed by 10 μl of 100 mm carbamylcholine and then 10 μl of 100 mm dibucaine (i.e. ∼500 μm final concentration for both ligands). For the experiments in Fig. 5, the nAChR was either preincubated for 30 min with 5 mm Carb in 200 μl of TRB (Fig. 5, trace ii, final Carb concentration ∼500 μm) or added directly to a TRB solution containing both 0.3 μm ethidium and 555 μm Carb (Fig. 5, trace iii, final Carb concentration also ∼500 μm). In the variable ethidium bromide concentration experiments (i.e. Fig. 6), 30 μg of nAChR was added to either a 0.3 μm (1× KD), 3.0 μm (10× KD), or 30.0 μm (100× KD) ethidium bromide/TRB solution. As above, both Carb and dibucaine were added at the indicated times. Due to higher concentrations of ethidium (i.e. 30 μm), a greater concentration of dibucaine was necessary for competitive displacement of ethidium, and a second 10-μl addition of 100 mm dibucaine was included in these experiments (i.e. final dibucaine concentration ∼1 mm). To test if PA is unique among anionic lipids in its ability to stabilize an agonist-activatable nAChR, the structural and functional properties of the nAChR were examined in a broader range of PC/anionic lipid mixtures. We initially focused on PC membranes containing the anionic lipid, phosphatidylglycerol (PG), because the cross-sectional area of the PG headgroup and its effects on bilayer physical properties are more similar to that of PA than to that of PC or other anionic lipids (Fig. 1) (24.Dickey A. Faller R. Biophys. J. 2008; 95: 2636-2646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 25.Elmore D.E. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Conversely, the anionic lipids phosphatidylinositol (PI) and cardiolipin have larger headgroups. If the anionic lipid headgroup cross-sectional area, and thus ability to influence the physical properties of a PC bilayer, contributes to the efficacy of PA, then mixtures of PC and PG should be more effective than mixtures of PC and either PI or cardiolipin at stabilizing an agonist-activatable nAChR. Infrared spectroscopy has shown that the lipid composition of a reconstituted membrane does not affect the overall secondary structure of the nAChR, but it does influence nAChR peptide hydrogen exchange kinetics (26.Méthot N. Demers C.N. Baenziger J.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15142-15149Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Lipid environments that stabilize an allosterically responsive nAChR typically slow peptide hydrogen exchange suggesting that the resting/coupled conformation has a less solvent-exposed tertiary/quaternary structure than the lipid-dependent uncoupled nAChR (14.daCosta C.J. Baenziger J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 17819-17825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 27.Baenziger J.E. Darsaut T.E. Morris M.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4905-4911Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The effects of PG, PI, and cardiolipin on nAChR secondary structure and peptide hydrogen exchange were examined by recording infrared spectra of each reconstituted membrane after 72 h of exposure to 2H2O. Representative deconvolved amide I/I′ bands show that the nAChR exhibits the same mixed α-helix/β-sheet secondary structure in PC membranes with or without PG, PI, or cardiolipin (supplemental Figs. S1A and S2A). Reconstituted PG-containing membranes, however, exhibit a slightly increased intensity because of protiated versus deuterated α-helices, suggesting a reduced level of nAChR peptide hydrogen/deuterium exchange in the presence of PG. The residual amide II band intensity, which is directly proportional to the number of peptide hydrogens that remain in the protiated form, confirms that the inclusion of PG, but not PI or cardiolipin, in a reconstituted PC membrane reduces the level of peptide hydrogen/deuterium exchange. Addition of Chol to the PG-containing bilayers further slows the exchange kinetics (Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. S1B). As noted, previous studies have shown an inverse correlation between the levels of nAChR peptide hydrogen exchange in a given membrane environment and the ability of the nAChR in that environment to undergo allosteric transitions (14.daCosta C.J. Baenziger J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 17819-17825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 27.Baenziger J.E. Darsaut T.E. Morris M.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4905-4911Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Based on the levels of peptide hydrogen/deuterium exchange (Fig. 2), we predict the relative abilities of the PC/anionic lipid membranes for stabilizing the agonist-activatable resting state to be 3:1:1 PC/PG/Chol > 3:2 PC/PG > 3:1 PC/PG > 3:2 PC/PI ≅ 3:1 PC/cardiolipin. These predictions are borne out by direct measurements of nAChR function (see below and Fig. 2). Infrared difference spectroscopy probes directly agonist-induced allosteric transitions (22.Baenziger J.E. Miller K.W. Rothschild K.J. Biophys. J. 1992; 61: 983-992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 28.Baenziger J.E. Miller K.W. Rothschild K.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5448-5454Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Carb difference spectra recorded from each of the PC/PG, PC/PI, and PC/cardiolipin membranes exhibits vibrations due to both nAChR-bound Carb (1724 cm−1) and the formation of cation-aromatic interactions between Carb and putative binding site tryptophan and tyrosine residues (1620 and 1516 cm−1, respectively) (Fig. 3 and supplemental Fig. S1) (23.Ryan S.E. Hill D.G. Baenziger J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10420-10426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 29.Baenziger J.E. Ryan S.E. Goodreid M.M. Vuong N.Q. Sturgeon R.M. daCosta C.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2008; 73: 880-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Carb binds to the nAChR in each of the different PC/anionic lipid membranes and does so with a similar pattern of recognition. Carb difference spectra recorded from the nAChR in all PG-containing lipid membranes also exhibit moderate positive amide I and amide II band intensities near 1655 and 1545 cm−1, respectively (Fig. 3, trace iii, and supplemental Fig. S1C). These vibrations, which are markers of the resting-to-desensitized structural change, show that the inclusion of PG in a PC membrane is sufficient to stabilize a small proportion of agonist-activatable resting nAChRs, even in the absence of Chol. Consistent with the hydrogen exchange data, the inclusion of Chol makes a PC/PG membrane even more effective at stabilizing a resting nAChR (Fig. 2). In contrast, Carb difference spectra recorded from both PC/PI-nAChR and PC/cardiolipin-nAChR (Fig. 3, traces iv and v) essentially lack positive intensity near 1655 and 1545 cm−1, suggesting that the nAChR in both environments is stabilized predominantly in a conformation that does not undergo the resting-to-desensitized transition. It appears that PC/PI-nAChR and PC/cardiolipin-nAChR adopt predominantly the uncoupled conformation. The infrared data show that membranes composed of PC with the anionic lipids PA or PG are more effective at stabilizing an agonist-activatable resting nAChR than PC membranes containing PS, PI, or cardiolipin. An additional physical or chemical property imparted onto the reconstituted membranes by PA and, to a lesser extent, PG, must play a role in modulating nAChR conformational equilibria. We examined further the abilities of PC/anionic lipid membranes to stabilize an agonist-activatable nAChR using the conformationally sensitive probe, ethidium bromide. Ethidium binds with high affinity to a hydrophobic site within the ion channel pore of the desensitized (KD ≅ 0.3 μm), but not the resting (KD ≅ 1 mm) nAChR (30.Herz J.M. Johnson D.A. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7238-7247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Relative to aqueous ethidium, nAChR-bound ethidium exhibits a greater fluorescence emission intensity, and its emission maximum shifts from 605 (aqueous solution) to 590 nm (nAChR-bound). Addition of PC/PA-nAChR to a 0.3 μm aqueous solution of ethidium leads to an increase in dibucaine-displaceable fluorescence emission intensity (Fig. 4, trace i). At this concentration, ethidium binds to ∼50% of the pre-existing desensitized receptors but not appreciably to the resting state. Also, 0.3 μm concentrations of ethidium are not sufficient to shift a large proportion of nAChRs from the resting to the desensitized conformation (the equilibrium dissociation constant in the absence of Carb is in the 7–11 μm range) (30.Herz J.M. Johnson D.A. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7238-7247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The dibucaine-displaceable fluorescence observed at 0.3 μm ethidium in the absence of Carb thus represents primarily ethidium binding to pre-existing desensitized nAChRs (see also below). Subsequent addition of 500 μm Carb leads to a substantial further increase in dibucaine-displaceable fluorescence showing that Carb binding allosterically shifts the population of resting nAChRs into the desensitized conformation. In contrast, there are essentially no changes in the fluorescence emission intensity upon the addition of PC-nAChR to aqueous ethidium, even after the addition of 500 μm Carb (Fig. 4, trace v). Consistent with the infrared difference measurements, the fluorescence data show that a substantial proportion of PC/PA-nAChR adopts a resting conformation that undergoes agonist-induced desensitization, whereas PC-nAChR is stabilized predominantly in the nonresponsive low ethidium af"

Many of these essential genes remain to be cloned. Hundreds of additional EMB genes have been cloned and catalogued (www.seedgenes.org) but not mapped. To facilitate EMB gene identification and assess the current level of saturation, we updated the classical map, compared the physical and genetic locations of mapped loci, and performed allelism tests between mapped (but not cloned) and cloned (but not mapped) emb mutants with similar chromosome locations. Two hundred pairwise combinations of genes located on chromosomes 1 and 5 were tested and more than 1100 total crosses were screened. Sixteen of 51 mapped emb mutants examined were found to be disrupted in a known EMB gene. Alleles of a wide range of published EMB genes (YDA, GLA1, TIL1, AtASP38, AtDEK1, EMB506, DG1, OEP80) were discovered. Two EMS mutants isolated 30 years ago, T-DNA mutants with complex insertion sites, and a mutant with an atypical, embryo-specific phenotype were resolved. The frequency of allelism encountered was consistent with past estimates of 500 to 1000 EMB loci. New EMB genes identified among mapped T-DNA insertion mutants included CHC1, which is required for chromatin remodeling, and SHS1/AtBT1, which encodes a plastidial nucleotide transporter similar to the maize Brittle1 protein required for normal endosperm development. Two classical genetic markers (PY, ALB1) were identified based on similar map locations of known genes required for thiamine (THIC) and chlorophyll (PDE166) biosynthesis. The alignment of genetic and physical maps presented here should facilitate the continued analysis of essential genes in Arabidopsis and further characterization of a broad spectrum of mutant phenotypes in a model plant."
https://openalex.org/W1975189002,"ACK1 (activated Cdc42-associated kinase 1), a cytoplsmic tyrosine kinase, is implicated in metastatic behavior, cell spreading and migration, and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling. The function of ACK1 in the regulation of receptor tyrosine kinases requires a C-terminal region that demonstrates a significant homology to the EGFR binding domain of MIG6. In this study, we have identified additional receptor tyrosine kinases, including Axl, leukocyte tyrosine kinase, and anaplastic lymphoma kinase, that can bind to the ACK1/MIG6 homology region. Unlike the interaction between MIG6 and EGFR, our data suggest that these receptor tyrosine kinases require the adaptor protein Grb2 for efficient binding, which interacts with highly conserved proline-rich regions that are conserved between ACK1 and MIG6. We have focused on Axl and compared how ACK1/Axl differs from the ACK1/EGFR axis by investigating effects of knockdown of endogenous ACK1. Although EGFR activation promotes ACK1 turnover, Axl activation by GAS6 does not; interestingly, the reciprocal down-regulation of GAS6-stimulated Axl is blocked by removing ACK1. Thus, ACK1 functions in part to control Axl receptor levels. Silencing of ACK1 also leads to diminished ruffling and migration in DU145 and COS7 cells upon GAS6-Axl signaling. The ability of ACK1 to modulate Axl and perhaps anaplastic lymphoma kinase (altered in anaplastic large cell lymphomas) might explain why ACK1 can promote metastatic and transformed behavior in a number of cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2068404192,Calnexin is a type I integral membrane phosphoprotein resident of the endoplasmic reticulum. Its intraluminal domain has been deduced to function as a lectin chaperone coordinating the timing of folding of newly synthesized N-linked glycoproteins of the secretory pathway. Its C-terminal cytosolic oriented extension has an ERK1 phosphorylation site at Ser(563) affecting calnexin association with the translocon. Here we find an additional function for calnexin phosphorylation at Ser(563) in endoplasmic reticulum quality control. A low dose of the misfolding agent l-azetidine 2-carboxylic acid slows glycoprotein maturation and diminishes the extent and rate of secretion of newly synthesized secretory alpha1-antitrypsin. Under these conditions the phosphorylation of calnexin is enhanced at Ser(563). Inhibition of this phosphorylation by the MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 enhanced the extent and rate of alpha1-antitrypsin secretion comparable with that achieved by inhibiting alpha-mannosidase activity with kifunensine. This is the first report in which the phosphorylation of calnexin is linked to the efficiency of secretion of a cargo glycoprotein.
https://openalex.org/W2041734564,"A likely key factor in the failure of a HIV-1 vaccine based on cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) is the natural immunodominance of epitopes that fall in variable regions of the proteome, which both increases the chance of epitope sequence mismatch with the incoming challenge strain and replicates the pathogenesis of early CTL failure due to epitope escape mutation during natural infection. To identify potential vaccine sequences to focus the CTL response on highly conserved epitopes, the whole proteomes of HIV-1 clades A1, B, C, and D were assessed for Shannon entropy at each amino acid position. Highly conserved regions in Gag (cGag-1, Gag 148–214, and cGag-2, Gag 253–331), Env (cEnv, Env 521–606), and Nef (cNef, Nef 106–148) were identified across clades. Inter- and intra-clade variability of amino acids within the regions tended to overlap, suggesting that polyvalent representation of consensus sequences for the four clades would allow broad HIV-1 strain representation. These four conserved regions were rich in both known and predicted CTL epitopes presented by a breadth of HLA types, and screening of 54 persons with chronic HIV-1 infection revealed that these regions are commonly immunogenic in the context of natural infection. These data suggest that vaccine delivery of a 16-valent mixture of these regions could focus the CTL response against conserved epitopes that are broadly representative of circulating HIV-1 strains."

https://openalex.org/W2058182298,"Na+/Ca2+ exchangers (NCX) constitute a major Ca2+ export system that facilitates the re-establishment of cytosolic Ca2+ levels in many tissues. Ca2+ interactions at its Ca2+ binding domains (CBD1 and CBD2) are essential for the allosteric regulation of Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity. The structure of the Ca2+-bound form of CBD1, the primary Ca2+ sensor from canine NCX1, but not the Ca2+-free form, has been reported, although the molecular mechanism of Ca2+ regulation remains unclear. Here, we report crystal structures for three distinct Ca2+ binding states of CBD1 from CALX, a Na+/Ca2+ exchanger found in Drosophila sensory neurons. The fully Ca2+-bound CALX-CBD1 structure shows that four Ca2+ atoms bind at identical Ca2+ binding sites as those found in NCX1 and that the partial Ca2+ occupancy and apoform structures exhibit progressive conformational transitions, indicating incremental regulation of CALX exchange by successive Ca2+ binding at CBD1. The structures also predict that the primary Ca2+ pair plays the main role in triggering functional conformational changes. Confirming this prediction, mutagenesis of Glu455, which coordinates the primary Ca2+ pair, produces dramatic reductions of the regulatory Ca2+ affinity for exchange current, whereas mutagenesis of Glu520, which coordinates the secondary Ca2+ pair, has much smaller effects. Furthermore, our structures indicate that Ca2+ binding only enhances the stability of the Ca2+ binding site of CBD1 near the hinge region while the overall structure of CBD1 remains largely unaffected, implying that the Ca2+ regulatory function of CBD1, and possibly that for the entire NCX family, is mediated through domain interactions between CBD1 and the adjacent CBD2 at this hinge.

This transporter functions as a Ca2+ efflux mechanism across cell membranes and broadly participates in Ca2+-mediated cellular signaling. NCXs have been identified in numerous tissues and cell types from several different species. In cardiac muscle, NCX1.1 plays a critical role in transsarcolemmal Ca2+ efflux, an essential requirement for cardiac relaxation (1Bers D.M. Excitation-Contraction Coupling and Cardiac Contractile Force. Kluwer Academic Publications, London1991: 71-92Google Scholar). In neuronal tissues, a variety of exchangers are intricately involved in the control of excitation-secretion signaling (2Blaustein M.P. Fontana G. Rogowski R.S. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 779: 300-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Notably, all characterized mammalian Na+/Ca2+ exchangers exhibit a common Ca2+-dependent regulatory mechanism, whereby their activity requires the presence of low concentrations of Ca2+ on their intracellular surface, and their activity is augmented in parallel with elevated intracellular Ca2+ levels (3Linck B. Qiu Z. He Z. Tong Q. Hilgemann D.W. Philipson K.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C415-C423Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This important regulatory property may permit the timely coupling of exchange function to alterations in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations to meet the continuous needs for overall Ca2+ balance. Na+/Ca2+ exchanger Ca2+ binding domain 1 transmembrane 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. The general similarities of exchange function and regulatory properties within the large NCX protein family are ascribed to their conserved structural arrangements: nine predicted transmembrane (TM) segments form the ion translocation pathway and a large loop of ∼500 amino acid residues splits TM helix-5 and -6 on the intracellular side of the molecule (4Nicoll D.A. Ottolia M. Philipson K.D. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2002; 976: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Ca2+-dependent regulation is attributed exclusively to Ca2+ interactions on the intracellular loop (5Matsuoka S. Nicoll D.A. Reilly R.F. Hilgemann D.W. Philipson K.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 3870-3874Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). A pair of Ca2+ binding domains (CBD1 and -2), called CALX-β motifs, has been identified (6Schwarz E.M. Benzer S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 10249-10254Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis revealed that CBD1 has conserved Ca2+ binding sites throughout the NCX family, whereas greater sequence diversity and/or Ca2+ binding capabilities occurs in CBD2 (7Wu M. Wang M. Nix J. Hryshko L.V. Zheng L. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 387: 104-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 27Hilge M. Aelen J. Foarce A. Perrakis A. Vuister G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Cell. 2006; 22: 15-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), it has been suggested that CBD1 acts as the primary sensor in the pair of CBDs. Mutations of carboxylate residues at CBD1 result in a pronounced reduction of the affinity for functional Ca2+ regulation (9Matsuoka S. Nicoll D.A. Hryshko L.V. Levitsky D.O. Weiss J.N.

The Ca2+-bound structures of CBD1 of NCX1 have recently been determined by NMR, and more recently by x-ray crystallography (8Hilge M. Aelen J. Vuister G.W. Mol.

Chem. 2006; 281: 21577-21581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The crystal structures revealed that four Ca2+ ions bind at the end of a β-sandwich structure of CBD1. More recently, a detailed study by backbone NMR suggested that Ca2+ binding induces a selective conformational change of CBD1 limited to the residues in the binding site, whereas the core of the β-sandwich structure remains unaffected (12Johnson E. Bruschweiler-Li L. Showalter S.A. Vuister G.W. Zhang F. Brüschweiler R. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 377: 945-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These observations raise a fundamental question of how the primary sensor role of CBD1 is conducted to the TM segments to control exchange activity. There is currently no structure available for the apoform of CBD1. Consequently, there is no related mechanistic information or insight into how Ca2+ binding induces the conformational change of CBD1 required for transduction of this signal. In the reported Ca2+-bound NCX1-CBD1 crystal structure, the Ca2+ binding site was saturated with four Ca2+ atoms (11Nicoll D.A. Sawaya M.R. Kwon S. Cascio D. Philipson K.D. Abramson J. J. Biol.

Whether these four Ca2+ access the binding site of CBD1 simultaneously or in a sequential way is unknown. Information of this type is critical toward understanding whether exchange function is simply switched on or off by Ca2+ or whether various degrees of exchange function are graded by different levels of Ca2+ occupancy. CALX, a Na+/Ca2+ exchange protein, was first identified in Drosophila photoreceptor cells (6Schwarz E.M. Benzer S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Physiol. 1998; 111: 691-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). CALX is responsible for extruding intracellular Ca2+ from these cells and plays an essential role in light-mediated signaling in Drosophila sensory neurons (14Wang T. Xu H. Oberwinkler J. Gu Y. Hardie R.C. Montell C. Neuron. 2005; 45: 367-378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). CALX shares 49% amino acid identity with the prototypical canine Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, NCX1.1. Functionally, it shares many properties found in mammalian exchangers (13Hryshko L.V. Matsuoka S. Nicoll D.A. Weiss J.N. Schwarz E.M. Benzer S. Philipson K.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, CALX exhibits a completely opposite response to regulatory Ca2+ compared with all other characterized mammalian NCX homologs: the highest activity of CALX occurs in the complete absence of regulatory Ca2+ and its activity is progressively inhibited, rather than stimulated, by elevations in intracellular regulatory [Ca2+]. This negative Ca2+ regulation of CALX leads to a considerable loss of signal amplification in the light response of the Drosophila visual system that triggers the photoreceptor cell cascade (14Wang T. Xu H. Oberwinkler J. Gu Y. Hardie R.C. Montell C. Neuron. 2005; 45: 367-378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). CALX also possesses a pair of CBD domains on its intracellular loop. The mechanism underlying the negative Ca2+ regulatory phenotype observed for CALX is still elusive and enigmatic based on the existing structural information for NCX1. Our recent crystal structure of CALX-CBD2 showed that this site is not a functional Ca2+ binding site, suggesting that CBD1 must be the critical site involved in Ca2+ regulation of CALX (7Wu M. Wang M. Nix J. Hryshko L.V. Zheng L. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 387: 104-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Furthermore, structural predictions, together with previous mutagenesis studies (7Wu M. Wang M. Nix J. Hryshko L.V. Zheng L. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 387: 104-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 15Dyck C. Maxwell K. Buchko J. Trac M. Omelchenko A. Hnatowich M. Hryshko L.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12981-12987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) have strongly suggested that CALX-CBD1 possesses a similar Ca2+ binding site as does NCX1. To gain further insight into the Ca2+-binding mechanisms of Na+/Ca2+ exchange proteins in atomic detail and to investigate the negative Ca2+ regulatory property of CALX, we have determined crystal structures of CBD1 from CALX1.1 in the presence and absence of Ca2+ and studied the properties of this regulatory mechanism by mutagenesis and electrophysiology. The gene fragments encoding the CBD1 (amino acids 442–554) from a full length cDNA of Drosophila CALX1.1 were cloned into the vector pET28a (Novagen) with restriction sites of NdeI/XhoI. In the generated plasmid, CBD1 has an N-terminal His-tag spaced by a thrombin cleavage site. Protein expression was performed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells in the autoinduction medium (16Studier F.W. Protein Expr. Purif. 2005; 41: 207-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (4134) Google Scholar) overnight at 25 °C. The cell pellet was suspended in a lysis buffer containing 50 mm sodium phosphate, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, pH 8.0, and ruptured by a high pressure homogenizer (Avestin). The lysate supernatant was applied to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin column (GE Healthcare), and the CALX-CBD1 protein was eluted with 300 mm imidazole. The purified protein was dialyzed overnight against a Tris-buffered saline buffer, pH 7.4, and was incubated with thrombin protease (GE Healthcare) overnight at 4 °C to truncate the His-tag. The proteolytic reaction mixtures were reapplied to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin and the pass-through containing untagged CALX-CBD1 proteins was concentrated by Centricon (Millipore) and further purified by size-exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 75 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare). The protein concentration was determined with a Coomassie protein determination kit (Pierce). All crystallization experiments were performed using the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method at 18 °C. CALX-CBD1, premixed with 1 mm CaCl2 at a protein concentration of 10 mg/ml, was crystallized using the following conditions: 50 mm MES, pH 6.0, 20% polyethylene glycol 3350. To obtain the apoform crystals, CALX-CBD1 protein was incubated with 10 mm EDTA for 1 h and then dialyzed against Tris-buffered saline buffer, pH 7.4, prior to the crystallization experiment. The apoform crystals were obtained under different conditions using 100 mm Bis-Tris, pH 6.5, 200 mm NH4Ac, 10 mm MgCl2, 15% polyethylene glycol 10,000. All crystals were flash-cooled to 100 K with 25% glycerol as the cryoprotectant. Diffraction data for the Ca2+ form crystal of CBD1 were collected at beamline X06SA of the Swiss Light Source (Villigen). A long wavelength (1.90 Å) was used for data collection with the intention of exploiting weak anomalous signals from Ca2+ atoms. The data collection for the apoform of CBD1 was carried out at the Advanced Light Sources beam line 4.2.2 (Berkeley, CA). Data processing, merging, and reduction were carried out with programs XDS and XSCALE (17Kabsch W. J. Appl. Cryst. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3230) Google Scholar). The CALX-CBD1 structures were solved using the molecular replacement method by the program PHASER (18McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D. Winn M.D. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. Phaser crystallographic software.J. Appl. Cryst. 2007; 40: 658-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (14538) Google Scholar) and using the CBD1 structure from NCX1 (Protein Data Bank code 2DPK) as a search model. Both structures were refined using the program Refmac (19Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Cryst. 1997; D53: 240-255Crossref Scopus (13867) Google Scholar). The model building was performed using COOT (20Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Cryst. 2004; D60: 2126-2132Crossref Scopus (23356) Google Scholar). Crystallographic data and the model refinement statistics are given in Table 1. The anomalous Fourier map in Fig. 1A was calculated using the program FFT (21Ten Eyck L.F.

Open table in a new tab Prior to CD spectroscopic analysis, CALX-CBD1 protein used for crystallization was passed through a desalting column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with a solution containing 200 mm NaF, pH 7.4, to remove any Cl−. The protein concentration was adjusted to 1 mg/ml before measurement. CD spectra of the CBD1 protein were collected at room temperature over a wavelength range from 190 to 260 nm with a Jasco J-720 spectrometer using a 0.02-cm cylindrical cell. Mutations of CALX1.1 were introduced by a modified site-directed mutagenesis procedure (23Zheng L. Baumann U. Reymond J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: e115Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). To exclude the possibility of random PCR errors on large cNDA of CALX (>3 kb), a minimal DNA fragment containing the sequencing-confirmed mutations was recloned back to the parent vector with appropriate restriction sites. The effect of each mutation on Ca2+ regulation of CALX1.1 was measured by outward Na+-Ca2+ exchange current recordings using the giant, excised patch clamp technique, as described previously (24Omelchenko A. Dyck C. Hnatowich M. Buchko J. Nicoll D.A. Philipson K.D. Hryshko L.V. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 691-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, Xenopus laevis oocytes were injected with ∼23–35 ng of cRNA of wild-type or mutant CALX1.1 and maintained at 18 °C. Electrophysiological measurements were typically obtained from day 3 to 7 postinjection. Borosilicate glass pipettes were pulled and polished to a final, inner diameter of ∼20–30 μm, and coated with a Parafilm®:mineral oil mixture to enhance patch stability and reduce electrical noise. Oocytes were briefly (∼5–10 min) transferred to a solution containing: 100 mm KOH, 100 mm K-aspartate, 100 mm MES, 20 mm HEPES, 10 mm NH3SO3, 5.0 mm EGTA, 5.0 mm Mg(OH)2; pH 7.0, at room temperature (with MES) to allow sufficient shrinkage of the cells in order for their vitellin layers to be removed by dissection. Giga ohm seals were formed by gentle suction, and membrane patches were excised by progressive movements of the pipette tip. Rapid solution changes were introduced using computer-controlled, multi-channel perfusion devices. Axon Instruments® hardware and software were used for data acquisition. A holding potential of 0 mV was employed for all current measurements. Pipette solutions contained 100 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine, 100 mm MES, 30 mm HEPES, 30 mm TEA-OH, 16 mm sulfamic acid, 8.0 mm CaCO3, 6.0 mm KOH, 0.25 mm ouabain, 0.1 mm flufenamic acid, 0.1 mm niflumic acid; pH 7.0, at room temperature (with MES). Currents were elicited by switching from Li+- to Na+-based perfusion solutions containing: 100 mm NaOH or LiOH, 100 mm l-aspartic acid, 20 mm CsOH, 20 mm HEPES, 20 mm TEA-OH, 10 mm EGTA, 3.00–21.84 mm NH3SO3, 0–9.91 mm CaCO3, 1.00–1.50 mm Mg(OH)2; pH 7.0, at 30 °C (with MES or LiOH). Stock solutions of CaCO3 and Mg(OH)2 were prepared in a ratio of 1:2 with sulfamic acid. Total Mg2+ and Ca2+ were adjusted to yield free concentrations of 1.00 mm and 0–30 μm, respectively, using MAXC software (25Bers D.M. Patton C.W. Nuccitelli R. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 40: 3-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). All experiments were conducted at 30 °C. Origin® software was used for curve-fitting and statistical analyses. Pooled data are mean ± S.E. Student’s t test or one-way analysis of variance and Tukey’s post hoc test, were used for statistical determinations. p < 0.05 was considered significant. The Ca2+-bound structure of CALX-CBD1 was determined at 2.25 Å resolution. The structure shows CALX-CBD1 has an immunoglobulin-like conformation formed by two anti-parallel β-sheets consisting of β-strands, A, B, G and C, D, E, F, respectively (Fig. 1A). CALX-CBD1 shares 60% sequence identity with that of canine NCX1-CBD1. Consequently, these two structures can be superimposed with a root mean square deviation of 0.84 Å for 113 aligned Cα atoms. The most significant difference between these two CBD1 structures occurs within their F-G loops. CALX-CBD1 has a rather short F–G loop with only 9 residues, whereas its counterpart from NCX1 consists of 28 residues and displays high flexibility, as indicated in the NMR structure (8Hilge M. Aelen J. Vuister G.W. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 15-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The Ca2+- bound CALX-CBD1 crystal diffraction data set was collected at 1.9 Å wavelength, allowing the assignment of the bound Ca2+ by examination of the anomalous signal (Fig. 1A). Four Ca2+ are clustered in the distal loops of the β-sandwich with ∼4 Å equal distance spacing between them. Nine carboxylate residues are involved in the coordination of Ca2+ (Fig. 1B). The side chains of these acidic residues are arranged in a zipper-like orientation, forming an extensive carboxylate cluster at the top of this β-sandwich. The E–F loop is the major component in the Ca2+ binding site with five of its residues involved in Ca2+ coordination. That is, the E–F loop crosses over the Ca2+ zipper line clamping Ca-1, -2, and -3 ions through coordination with carboxylate groups of Asp515, Asp516, and Glu520 together with the carbonyl oxygen atoms of Asp517 and Val518. Compared with Ca-1 or -2, which is penta- or hexacoordinated, Ca-4 is only tricoordinated with Asp490, Glu523, and Glu520. Consequently, Ca-4 displays the highest thermal B factor, suggesting it may be the most mobile species during these ligand interactions. The Ca2+ binding sites of CALX-CBD1 are almost identical to those of NCX1 except for Glu455, which locates centrally on the basement of the binding site. Compared with the NCX1 structure, this residue rotates its carboxyl group by 90°, resulting in simultaneous coordination with three Ca2+ (Ca-1, Ca-2, and Ca-3) instead of one (Ca-2) shown in the NCX1-CBD1 structure (11Nicoll D.A. Sawaya M.R. Kwon S. Cascio D. Philipson K.D. Abramson J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 21577-21581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In addition, it appears that the disulfide bridge locking the A–B loop near Glu385 in the NCX1-CBD1 structure is absent in CALX-CBD1, as a valine replaces cysteine at position 453. To gain additional structural information regarding Ca2+ binding to CBD1, the CBD1 protein was treated with 10 mm EDTA and dialyzed prior to crystallization; the apoform structure was determined at 1.6 Å resolution. The EDTA-treated sample gives the same crystal packing as that of the Ca2+-bound form; four monomers assemble in anti-parallel in an asymmetric unit. The overall structure of the apoform CBD1 shows no overall conformational changes compared with the Ca2+-bound form except within the Ca2+ binding sites. In the Ca2+-bound structure, Ca2+ binding sites of four monomers in an asymmetric unit were identically and fully occupied. In contrast, the same binding sites exhibit three distinct Ca2+ binding states in the apoform structure. Monomer B shows a full occupancy state as shown in the Ca2+-form structure, where four Ca2+ were found in the Ca2+ binding site and all residues involved in Ca2+ coordination are clearly visible (Fig. 2A). However, monomer A displays a partial Ca2+ binding state. Only Ca-1 and -2 (the primary Ca2+ pair) were found at similar positions as in monomer B (Fig. 2B). The absence of Ca-3 and Ca-4 (named as the secondary Ca2+ pair) does not result in any significant structural change compared with monomer A with root mean square deviation values of 0.28 Å for backbone atoms and 0.68 Å for all atoms. The conformational change occurs exclusively at Glu520, whose side chain is invisible in the electron density map. The backbone of the entire E–F loop is still clearly resolved and appears to be stabilized by the primary Ca2+ pair. However, the thermal B factors of the residues on the E–F loop are considerably increased compared with those in monomer B (Fig. 3). A water molecule at position 265 was found at Ca-3 position, which forms two hydrogen bonds with Glu455 and Asp490. No density can be observed in the Ca-4 position. The conformations of Asp490 and Glu523 remain unchanged; they are stabilized by a hydrogen bond network with a water molecule at position 324. Strikingly, both monomers C and D represent the true apoform, and no Ca2+ can be found in corresponding regions (Fig. 2C). Nearly all residues involved in Ca2+ binding become invisible, particularly the entire E–F loop (Asp516–Glu522), which strongly suggests that the primary Ca2+ pair plays a critical role in stabilizing the entire Ca2+ binding region. The disorder of the Ca2+ binding region has no impact on the overall β-sheet structure of CBD1 and the neighboring C–D loop containing Asp490 is still clearly resolved. Both Ca2+-free forms superimpose well with similar root mean square deviation values of 0.44 Å for backbone atoms and 0.97 Å for all atoms. Notably, no Ca2+ binding region from these four monomers is involved in crystal packing, and all four monomers display comparable thermal B factors (Table 1 and Fig. 3). Our structural observations indicate that no gross conformational changes occur during Ca2+ binding. To exclude any possible effects of crystallization constraints, the Ca2+ extraction experiment was performed in solution with monitoring by CD spectroscopy. The result shows CBD1 protein exhibits a full β-strand conformation, as expected (Fig. 4A). No detectable change of protein secondary structure was observed by addition of either 2 mm Ca2+ (Fig. 4B) or 10 mm EDTA (Fig. 4C). Notably, 10 mm EDTA causes Ca2+ unbinding of CBD1 of NCX1 (8Hilge M. Aelen J. Vuister G.W. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 15-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Two residues, Glu455 and Glu520, are involved in the coordination of three Ca2+ at the CBD1 site, although they differ in the specific Ca2+ ions which are involved (Glu455 with Ca-1, -2, and -3; Glu520 with Ca-2, -3, and -4). Our structural data suggest that Glu455, which coordinates the primary Ca2+ pair, plays a more important role in stabilizing the entire Ca2+ binding region than Glu520. To examine whether these two glutamate residues have unequal functions in the Ca2+-dependent regulatory mechanism, they were mutated into Asp and/or Ala. RNA from either the wild-type CALX1.1 or various mutant exchangers was injected into Xenopus laevis oocytes, and the outward currents were recorded to evaluate functional Ca2+ regulation. The overlapping traces in Fig. 5A show representative outward Na+-Ca2+ exchange currents for wild-type CALX1.1 at four different Ca2+ concentrations. In the absence of regulatory Ca2+, CALX is fully activated by the application of 100 mm Na+. However, both peak and steady-state currents become substantially suppressed by increasing the concentration of regulatory Ca2+. (Results obtained at 1, 3, and 10 μm are shown.) The corresponding IC50s for peak and steady-state currents are 0.4 ± 0.1 μm and 0.13 ± 0.002 μm, respectively. Even though Glu520 appears to have the equivalent Ca2+ coordinating capacity as Glu455 (i.e. three Ca2+), it exhibits far less importance in mediating the Ca2+ regulatory response. Mutations of these two residues illustrate their different functional roles. The Ca2+ dependence of peak and steady-state currents of these mutants are presented in Fig. 5, E and F. In the E520A mutation, there is only a slight reduction in the inhibitory potency of regulatory Ca2+ for peak currents, (IC50s = 1.2 ± 0.01 μm) and even less for steady-state currents (0.22 ± 0.06 μm) (Fig. 5B). In sharp contrast, the Ca2+ response is much more sensitive to changes at residue Glu455. The E455A mutation results in a dramatic alteration of the Ca2+ regulatory response. Both peak and steady-state currents are not appreciably inhibited until the level of regulatory Ca2+ reaches 3 μm (Fig. 5D). The apparent Ca2+ affinity of E455A for regulation of peak currents is reduced by ∼20-fold to IC50 = 8.1 ± 0.5 μm. Steady-state currents show an even greater reduction in the inhibitory potency of regulatory Ca2+, which drops by 35-fold to 3.5 ± 0.2 μm. We also mutated Glu455 to an Asp. Similar to E455A, as shown in Fig. 5C, this conservative mutant shows a large shift in the affinity for functional Ca2+ regulation, which now appears at the level of 1 μm Ca2+. The inhibitory potency of regulatory Ca2+ is reduced by nearly ∼17-fold for both peak (6.7 ± 1.3 μm) and steady-state currents (1.7 ± 0.1 μm). These r"
https://openalex.org/W2010393877,"Polytopic membrane proteins subjected to endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation are extracted from membranes and targeted to proteasomes for destruction. The extraction mechanism is poorly understood. One polytopic ER protein subjected to ER-associated degradation is Insig-1, a negative regulator of cholesterol synthesis. Insig-1 is rapidly degraded by proteasomes when cells are depleted of cholesterol, and its degradation is inhibited when sterols accumulate in cells. Insig-2, a functional homologue of Insig-1, is degraded slowly, and its degradation is not regulated by sterols. Here, we report that a single amino acid substitution in Insig-2, Insig-2(L210A), causes Insig-2 to be degraded in an accelerated and sterol-regulated manner similar to Insig-1. In seeking an explanation for the accelerated degradation, we found that proteasomes bind to wild type Insig-1 and mutant Insig-2(L210A) but not to wild type Insig-2, whereas the proteins are still embedded in cell membranes. This binding depends on at least two factors, ubiquitination of Insig and association with the ATPase p97/VCP complex. These data suggest that p97 recruits proteasomes to polytopic ER proteins even before they are extracted from membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1995092994,"Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer morbidity. To improve an understanding of molecular causes of disease a transgenic mouse model was investigated where targeted expression of the serine threonine kinase c-Raf to respiratory epithelium induced initially dysplasia and subsequently adenocarcinomas. This enables dissection of genetic events associated with precancerous and cancerous lesions.By laser microdissection cancer cell populations were harvested and subjected to whole genome expression analyses. Overall 473 and 541 genes were significantly regulated, when cancer versus transgenic and non-transgenic cells were compared, giving rise to three distinct and one common regulatory gene network. At advanced stages of tumor growth predominately repression of gene expression was observed, but genes previously shown to be up-regulated in dysplasia were also up-regulated in solid tumors. Regulation of developmental programs as well as epithelial mesenchymal and mesenchymal endothelial transition was a hall mark of adenocarcinomas. Additionally, genes coding for cell adhesion, i.e. the integrins and the tight and gap junction proteins were repressed, whereas ligands for receptor tyrosine kinase such as epi- and amphiregulin were up-regulated. Notably, Vegfr- 2 and its ligand Vegfd, as well as Notch and Wnt signalling cascades were regulated as were glycosylases that influence cellular recognition. Other regulated signalling molecules included guanine exchange factors that play a role in an activation of the MAP kinases while several tumor suppressors i.e. Mcc, Hey1, Fat3, Armcx1 and Reck were significantly repressed. Finally, probable molecular switches forcing dysplastic cells into malignantly transformed cells could be identified.This study provides insight into molecular pertubations allowing dysplasia to progress further to adenocarcinoma induced by exaggerted c-Raf kinase activity."

Escherichia coli NDH-1 is composed of 13 subunits (NuoA–N). NuoM (ND4) subunit is one of the hydrophobic subunits that constitute the membrane arm of NDH-1 and was predicted to bear 14 helices. We attempted to clarify the membrane topology of NuoM by the introduction of histidine tags into different positions by chromosomal site-directed mutagenesis. From the data, we propose a topology model containing 12 helices (helices I–IX and XII–XIV) located in transmembrane position and two (helices X and XI) present in the cytoplasm. We reported previously that residue Glu144 of NuoM was located in the membrane (helix V) and was essential for the energy-coupling activities of NDH-1 (Torres-Bacete, J., Nakamaru-Ogiso, E., Matsuno-Yagi, A., and Yagi, T.

Complex I is one of the largest and most intricate proteins of the respiratory chain, e.g. bovine complex I was reported to contain 45 different subunits (5.Carroll J. Fearnley I.M. Shannon R.J.

In contrast, NDH-1 has relatively simpler structure and seems suitable to study the coupling site 1. In case of Escherichia coli, NDH-1 is made up of only 13 subunits (designated NuoA–N), which are homologous to the 14 subunits that compose the central core of mitochondrial complex I (7.Yagi T.

Electron microscopic images of both mitochondrial complex I and bacterial NDH-1 have revealed a characteristic L-shaped form with two distinct domains, a hydrophilic peripheral arm projected into the mitochondrial matrix (or bacterial cytoplasm) and a transmembrane hydrophobic arm (9.Guénebaut V. Schlitt A. Weiss H. Leonard K. Friedrich T. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The hydrophilic domain catalyzes electron transfer from NADH to quinone and carries all of the cofactors (one FMN and eight or nine iron-sulfur clusters) (10.Takano S. Yano T. Yagi T.

In contrast, the membrane domain is considered to participate in proton translocation and quinone binding (14.Nakamaru-Ogiso E. Sakamoto K. Matsuno-Yagi A. Miyoshi H. Yagi T.

Hinchliffe P. Science. 2006; 311: 1430-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). In E. coli NDH-1 the transmembrane arm is composed of seven subunits (namely NuoA, -H, -J, -K, -L, -M, and -N), all of them homologous to the seven mitochondrial-encoded subunits in eukaryotes (ND1–6 and ND4L) (20.Chomyn A.

Preliminary structural studies have outlined the distribution of hydrophobic subunits in the membrane arm, in which NuoJ, -H, -A, -K, and -N are close to the hydrophilic arm, whereas NuoM and -L have a distal location (23.Baranova E.A. Holt P.J. Sazanov L.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 366: 140-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 24.Baranova E.A. Morgan D.J. Sazanov L.A. J. Struct.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7229-7235Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The last two subunits together with NuoN show a high degree of sequence homology. It was also described that NuoN, -M, and -L are well conserved with their counterpart subunits among the different complex 1/NDH-1 enzymes and with some Na+/H+ membrane antiporters and energy-converting [NiFe]-hydrogenases (26.Friedrich T. Scheide D. FEBS Lett. 2000; 479: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 27.Hedderich R. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2004; 36: 65-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 28.Friedrich T. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2001; 33: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). This sequence similarity, mainly with Mrp-like Na+/H+ antiporters, has led to relating the function of NuoL, -N, and -M subunits with proton translocation activity of NDH-1 (16.Steuber J. J. Biol.

De Leon-Rangel J. Vik S.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1757: 1557-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The possibility of generating chromosomal deletions and the introduction of site-directed mutations in the nuo genes by homologous recombination has allowed functional studies on various hydrophobic subunits, such as NuoA (ND3), NuoJ (ND6), NuoK (ND4L), NuoN (ND2), NuoM (ND4), and NuoH (ND1) (32.Amarneh B.

The NuoM subunit, counterpart of the eukaryotic ND4 subunit, is one of the largest polypeptides in the hydrophobic arm of NDH-1. This highly hydrophobic subunit was predicted to be composed of 14 helices (23.Baranova E.A. Holt P.J. Sazanov L.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 366: 140-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 30.Mathiesen C. Hägerhäll C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1556: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In a recent work, we introduced site-directed mutations in several conserved charged amino acids of the NuoM subunit (36.Torres-Bacete J. Nakamaru-Ogiso E. Matsuno-Yagi A. Yagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 36914-36922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This study, lately corroborated by Euro et al. (40.Euro L. Belevich G. Verkhovsky M.I. Wikström M. Verkhovskaya M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1777: 1166-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), showed the importance of NuoM in the NDH-1 activity. Mutations of the conserved Glu144 and Lys234 completely abolished the energy-coupled activities of NDH-1 in the E144A mutant and led to a 90% activity suppression in the case of K234A mutant. Interestingly, in the case of the transmembrane conserved Glu144, its conservative mutation to Asp did not show any effect on NDH-1 activity. In this regard, highly conserved transmembrane carboxyl residues in NuoK (ND4L) and NuoA (ND3) (34.Kao M.C. Nakamaru-Ogiso E. Matsuno-Yagi A. Yagi T. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 9545-9554Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 35.Kao M.C. Di Bernardo S. Perego M. Nakamaru-Ogiso E. Matsuno-Yagi A. Yagi T. J. Biol.

Chan S.I. Annu. Rev. Phys. Chem. 1989; 40: 671-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 42.Slepkov E.R. Rainey J.K. Sykes B.D. Fliegel L. Biochem.

Acta. 2006; 1758: 627-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Thus, it was suggested that the essential Glu144 of the NuoM subunit could play a key role in the proton pump activity of NDH-1. As a first step to clarify the mechanism of H+ translocation in NDH-1, further characterization of NuoM was a prerequisite.In this work, we have first attempted to experimentally clarify the topological structure of the E. coli NuoM subunit by introducing His6 tag in the N- and C-terminal regions and the potential extramembrane loops of NuoM. Second, we have studied the importance of the location of essential carboxyl group of Glu144 for the proton pump activity of NDH-1 by shifting its position in transmembrane helix V.DISCUSSIONOn the basis of analyses of the primary structures by several computer programs (TopPreIII, PHDhtm, TMHMM, SOSUI, Tmpred, and HMMTOP), the E. coli NuoM subunit was previously predicted to contain 14 transmembrane segments (designated helices I–XIV from the N terminus) (36.Torres-Bacete J. Nakamaru-Ogiso E. Matsuno-Yagi A. Yagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 36914-36922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Our present topology experiments determined that (i) loops 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 10, 11, and 13 face the cytoplasmic phase and (ii) N and C termini and loops 2 and 6 are directed to periplasmic phase. These results indicate that helices X and XI are not membrane-spanning segments but are present in the cytoplasm. Determination of the sidedness of loops 4, 8, and 12 was not successful. As expected from the primary sequence of the stretch between helix IV, loop 4, and helix V, the peptide is more hydrophobic compared with the stretch between helix X, loop 10, and helix XI. It seems likely that helix V is a transmembrane segment. Taking these together, we propose the topology of E. coli NuoM as shown in Fig. 2B.The secondary structure of NuoM is considered to be similar to that of NuoL except that the latter has two extra helices at the C-terminal end. The topology of Rhodobacter capsulatus NuoL based on the alkaline phosphatase fusion method has been reported (30.Mathiesen C. Hägerhäll C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1556: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). It was suggested that loops 8 and 12 of NuoL (corresponding to loops 8 and 12 of NuoM) face the periplasmic phase. However, between the two loops in NuoL, when the fusion site was shifted by two residues, the results changed from high activity (suggesting the periplasmic side) to low activity (the cytoplasmic side or in the membrane). The proposed topology of NuoL was based on the latter, and the high activity result was regarded as a false positive. These ambiguous data may be related to known issues of reliability of the procedure involving alkaline phophatase in membrane topological studies (53.Lewis M.J. Chang J.A. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10541-10550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 54.Newton G. Yun C.H. Gennis R.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 2511-2518Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Determining the final topology of subunits NuoM and NuoL will need further scrutiny.We constructed two mutants each for loops 4 and 8 and one mutant for loop 12 for topology research. It was interesting to observe that in none of these five His6 insertion mutants could we detect NuoM in the membrane preparation or NDH-1 assembly in the native gels. These loops seem to be directed to the periplasmic phase. In addition, they are all short and hydrophobic (loop 4, M-FL-F; loop 8, F-SLPLFPNAS-A; loop 12, F-VGEFMILFGSF-Q) (a chargeable residue is underlined). In contrast, loops 8 (F-EYAPEAK-M) and 12 (V-GFAGYLSKDAIIESAFAS-G) of R. capsulatus NuoL are more hydrophilic. It might be possible that loops 4, 8, and 12 in NuoM are located in the interface between membrane and periplasm, and insertions of His6 tag into these loops unstabilize NuoM. In other words, structures of loops 4, 8, and 12 seem to be essential to maintain the intact structure of NuoM.There is a hypothesis for the structural importance of hydrophilic residues in keeping the stability of transmembrane helices and in maintaining the transmembrane position or controlling the movements of the helix inside the membrane depending on their ionization state (55.Caputo G.A. London E. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3275-3285Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 56.Caputo G.A. London E. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 8794-8806Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 57.Krishnakumar S.S. London E. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 374: 1251-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, mutants EAE1–20 and E144A scarcely affected NDH-1 assembly or the contents of the peripheral subunits and the dNADH dehydrogenase activity of the mutant membranes. In addition, mutant E144D illustrated dNADH dehydrogenase activities similar to the wild type membranes (36.Torres-Bacete J. Nakamaru-Ogiso E. Matsuno-Yagi A. Yagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 36914-36922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is unlikely that Glu144 significantly contributes to the structure of NDH-1.It is recognized that proton- and ion-translocating enzymes in the membrane contain essential carboxyl residue(s) in the hydrophobic regions (e.g. the DCCD-binding subunit of ATP synthase (58.Miller M.J. Oldenburg M. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1990; 87: 4900-4904Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and Na+/H+ antiporters (59.Inoue H. Noumi T. Tsuchiya T. Kanazawa H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 363: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 60.Padan E. Trends Biochem.

Microbiology. 2009; 155: 2137-2147Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar)). Two such carboxyl groups have been described for NDH-1. Our group and other laboratories showed that Glu36 in NuoK (ND4L) and Glu144 in NuoM (ND4) are absolutely essential for the energy-coupled NDH-1 activities (34.Kao M.C. Nakamaru-Ogiso E. Matsuno-Yagi A. Yagi T. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 9545-9554Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 36.Torres-Bacete J. Nakamaru-Ogiso E. Matsuno-Yagi A. Yagi T. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 773-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Based on the facts that Glu144 is conserved in energy-converting [NiFe]-hydrogenases and Mrp (Na+/H+) antiporters and that NDH-1/complex I are inhibited by amiloride derivatives that are specific inhibitors for Na+/H+ antiporters (14.Nakamaru-Ogiso E. Sakamoto K. Matsuno-Yagi A. Miyoshi H. Yagi T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 746-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 62.Nakamaru-Ogiso E. Seo B.B. Yagi T. Matsuno-Yagi A. FEBS Lett. 2003; 549: 43-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), we postulated that Glu144 in NuoM plays a role in the proton translocation of NDH-1. Recently, Kajiyama et al. (61.Kajiyama Y. Otagiri M. Sekiguchi J. Kudo T. Kosono S. Microbiology. 2009; 155: 2137-2147Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) reported that subunit MrpD in Bacillus subtilis Mrp-like (Na+/H+) antiporter (a homologue of NuoM) conserves Glu144 of NuoM (Glu137 MrpD numbering) so that Glu137 in MrpD is critically involved in ΔpH-dependent Na+ efflux on the basis of mutagenesis experiments. Glu137 in MrpD is hypothesized to participate in proton and/or Na+ translocation (61.Kajiyama Y. Otagiri M. Sekiguchi J. Kudo T. Kosono S. Microbiology. 2009; 155: 2137-2147Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), suggesting that NDH-1 and Mrp antiporters may share the same mechanism of energy transduction.It has been reported that certain repositioning of essential Asp61 in the DCCD-binding subunit retained the energy-coupled activities of ATP synthase. Mutants D61N/A24D (horizontal repositioning of Asp61 by switching Asp in adjacent transmembrane helix) and D61N/M57D (repositioning Asp61 by one helical turn toward the cytoplasmic side) restored the energy transducing activities (58.Miller M.J. Oldenburg M. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1990; 87: 4900-4904Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 63.Langemeyer L. Engelbrecht S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1767: 998-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). These results suggest that Asp61 has site flexibility for the proton-translocating function of the carboxyl residue. As described in Ref. 4.Yagi T. Matsuno-Yagi A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2266-2274Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, NDH-1/complex I can catalyze reverse reaction similar to ATP synthase. We systematically constructed mutants with Glu shifting in helix V and characterized these mutants. The mutants in which Glu was positioned at 140, 144, or 147 can catalyze the energy transduction. Moving the Glu to other positions resulted in a loss of energy coupling. It should be noted that positions 140, 144, and 147 align vertically on helix V. The results are quite similar to what was reported for the Asp of the DCCD-binding protein. It will be interesting to study whether these properties of carboxyl residues are common in other proton (Na+) translocation systems in general. Based on our results and the proposed mechanism of Na+/H+-antiporter (64.Arkin I.T. Xu H. Jensen M.Ø. Arbely E. Bennett E.R. Bowers K.J. Chow E. Dror R.O. Eastwood M.P. Flitman-Tene R. Gregersen B.A. Klepeis J.L. Kolossváry I. Shan Y. Shaw D.E. Science. 2007; 317: 799-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), we may speculate that a proton to be pumped by NuoM can penetrate from the cytoplasm to positions 140, 144, and 147 and ligate to the carboxyl residue. Further, the carboxyl residue could translocate the bound proton and release it to the periplasmic side. During one turnover of Na+/H+ antiporter, two conformational change steps are considered to be triggered by proton transports. Whether these steps are related to the energy-coupled electron transfer of NDH-1 remains to be seen. INTRODUCTIONThe proton-translocating NADH-quinone oxidoreductase (designated complex I and NDH-1 for mitochondrial and bacterial enzymes, respectively) constitutes the first energy-coupling site in the respiratory chain in most eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. It catalyzes the reduction of quinone using NADH as electron donor. This activity is coupled to the translocation of protons through the inner mitochondrial/cytoplasmic membranes (1.Bertsova Y.V. Bogachev A.V. FEBS Lett. 2004; 563: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 2.Stolpe S. Friedrich T. J. Biol.

Complex I is one of the largest and most intricate proteins of the respiratory chain, e.g. bovine complex I was reported to contain 45 different subunits (5.Carroll J. Fearnley I.M. Shannon R.J. Hirst J. Walker J.E. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2003; 2: 117-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 6.Carroll J. Fearnley I.M. Skehel J.M. Shannon R.J. Hirst J. Walker J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 32724-32727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). In contrast, NDH-1 has relatively simpler structure and seems suitable to study the coupling site 1. In case of Escherichia coli, NDH-1 is made up of only 13 subunits (designated NuoA–N), which are homologous to the 14 subunits that compose the central core of mitochondrial complex I (7.Yagi T. Yano T. Di Bernardo S. Matsuno-Yagi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 8.Friedrich T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 134-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Electron microscopic images of both mitochondrial complex I and bacterial NDH-1 have revealed a characteristic L-shaped form with two distinct domains, a hydrophilic peripheral arm projected into the mitochondrial matrix (or bacterial cytoplasm) and a transmembrane hydrophobic arm (9.Guénebaut V. Schlitt A. Weiss H. Leonard K. Friedrich T. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The hydrophilic domain catalyzes electron transfer from NADH to quinone and carries all of the cofactors (one FMN and eight or nine iron-sulfur clusters) (10.Takano S. Yano T. Yagi T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9120-9127Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 11.Yano T. Yagi T. J. Biol.

Hinchliffe P. Science. 2006; 311: 1430-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). In E. coli NDH-1 the transmembrane arm is composed of seven subunits (namely NuoA, -H, -J, -K, -L, -M, and -N), all of them homologous to the seven mitochondrial-encoded subunits in eukaryotes (ND1–6 and ND4L) (20.Chomyn A.

Preliminary structural studies have outlined the distribution of hydrophobic subunits in the membrane arm, in which NuoJ, -H, -A, -K, and -N are close to the hydrophilic arm, whereas NuoM and -L have a distal location (23.Baranova E.A. Holt P.J. Sazanov L.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 366: 140-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 24.Baranova E.A. Morgan D.J. Sazanov L.A. J. Struct.

It was also described that NuoN, -M, and -L are well conserved with their counterpart subunits among the different complex 1/NDH-1 enzymes and with some Na+/H+ membrane antiporters and energy-converting [NiFe]-hydrogenases (26.Friedrich T. Scheide D. FEBS Lett. 2000; 479: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 27.Hedderich R. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2004; 36: 65-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 28.Friedrich T. J.

This sequence similarity, mainly with Mrp-like Na+/H+ antiporters, has led to relating the function of NuoL, -N, and -M subunits with proton translocation activity of NDH-1 (16.Steuber J. J. Biol.

De Leon-Rangel J. Vik S.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1757: 1557-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The possibility of generating chromosomal deletions and the introduction of site-directed mutations in the nuo genes by homologous recombination has allowed functional studies on various hydrophobic subunits, such as NuoA (ND3), NuoJ (ND6), NuoK (ND4L), NuoN (ND2), NuoM (ND4), and NuoH (ND1) (32.Amarneh B.

The NuoM subunit, counterpart of the eukaryotic ND4 subunit, is one of the largest polypeptides in the hydrophobic arm of NDH-1. This highly hydrophobic subunit was predicted to be composed of 14 helices (23.Baranova E.A. Holt P.J. Sazanov L.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 366: 140-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 30.Mathiesen C. Hägerhäll C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1556: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In a recent work, we introduced site-directed mutations in several conserved charged amino acids of the NuoM subunit (36.Torres-Bacete J. Nakamaru-Ogiso E. Matsuno-Yagi A. Yagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 36914-36922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This study, lately corroborated by Euro et al. (40.Euro L. Belevich G. Verkhovsky M.I. Wikström M. Verkhovskaya M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1777: 1166-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), showed the importance of NuoM in the NDH-1 activity. Mutations of the conserved Glu144 and Lys234 completely abolished the energy-coupled activities of NDH-1 in the E144A mutant and led to a 90% activity suppression in the case of K234A mutant. Interestingly, in the case of the transmembrane conserved Glu144, its conservative mutation to Asp did not show any effect on NDH-1 activity. In this regard, highly conserved transmembrane carboxyl residues in NuoK (ND4L) and NuoA (ND3) (34.Kao M.C. Nakamaru-Ogiso E. Matsuno-Yagi A. Yagi T.

As a first step to clarify the mechanism of H+ translocation in NDH-1, further characterization of NuoM was a prerequisite.In this work, we have first attempted to experimentally clarify the topological structure of the E. coli NuoM subunit by introducing His6 tag in the N- and C-terminal regions and the potential extramembrane loops of NuoM. Second, we have studied the importance of the location of essential carboxyl group of Glu144 for the proton pump activity of NDH-1 by shifting its position in transmembrane helix V."

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 4The abbreviations used are: LPSlipopolysaccharideKdo2-keto-3- deoxymanno-octulonic acidCNSCMP-5-N-acetylneuraminic acid synthaseITCisothermal calorimetryPDBProtein Data Bank. is a major component of the outer leaflet of the outer membrane in Gram-negative bacteria and is essential for outer membrane integrity and cell viability (1.Raetz C.R. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar, 2.Nikaido H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol.

Biochem. 2007; 76: 295-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). LPS has a well defined tripartite structure consisting of a hydrophobic moiety, lipid A, linked to an inner and outer core oligosaccharide that may itself be linked to a high molecular weight polysaccharide molecule or O antigen (1.Raetz C.R. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar, 3.Raetz C.R. Reynolds C.M. Trent M.S. Bishop R.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 295-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). In the vast majority of Gram-negative bacteria, the minimum LPS structure for viability is lipid A that has been substituted with two residues of 2-keto-3-deoxymanno-octulonic acid (Kdo), referred to as Kdo2-lipid A (1.Raetz C.R. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar, 3.Raetz C.R. Reynolds C.M. Trent M.S. Bishop R.E. Annu. Rev.

The formation of CMP-Kdo is catalyzed by the enzyme Kdo cytidyltransferase (CMP-Kdo synthetase), which is known as KdsB in Escherichia coli (4.Ray P.H. Benedict C.D. Grasmuk H. J.

Kdo and N-acetylneuraminic acid are unique in as far as their activated forms are nucleoside monophosphate diesters as opposed to the more common nucleoside diphosphate diesters that are the usual product of sugar-activating enzymes. Furthermore, KdsB and CNS are unique in the sense that they directly couple the sugar to CTP unlike other sugar-activating enzymes that require a phosphorylated sugar substrate. Both CMP-Kdo synthetase and bacterial CMP-NeuAc synthetase have been postulated to be viable drug targets (10.Claesson A. Luthman K. Gustafsson K. Bondesson G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 143: 1063-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 11.Goldman R. Kohlbrenner W. Lartey P. Pernet A.

Nature. 1987; 327: 730-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The importance of CMP-Kdo synthetase as a target has been recognized by a number of groups and has resulted in the successful design of a series of potent in vitro inhibitors of the enzyme based on the structure of 2β-deoxy-Kdo (Fig. 2) (10.Claesson A. Luthman K. Gustafsson K. Bondesson G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 143: 1063-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, none of the 2β-deoxy-Kdo derivatives were capable of crossing the inner membrane and reaching the KdsB enzyme in the cytoplasm and consequently showed no in vivo activity (11.Goldman R. Kohlbrenner W. Lartey P. Pernet A. Nature. 1987; 329: 162-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 12.Hammond S.M. Claesson A. Jansson A.M. Larsson L.G. Pring B.G. Town C.M. Ekström B.

The design of new, improved inhibitors of KdsB that are capable of crossing the cytoplasmic membrane has been limited by the lack of detailed kinetic and structural information on the enzyme. Although structural information is available for both the capsule-specific and lipopolysaccharide-specific isozymes of the E. coli CMP-Kdo synthetase (13.Jelakovic S. Schulz G.E. J. Mol.

Therefore, in this study we have developed a new continuous assay for the reaction, which has facilitated a complete kinetic characterization of the enzyme and subsequent inhibition studies with 2β-deoxy-Kdo. Furthermore, we have obtained a 1.9 Å crystal structure of a ternary complex of the LPS-specific isozyme of the E. coli enzyme with the 2β-deoxy-Kdo inhibitor and CTP bound in the active site in addition to a novel 2.5 Å ligand-free structure. This has allowed us to map the essential interactions made in the catalytically relevant ternary CTP-Kdo-KdsB complex and will be crucial for the design of more potent antimicrobial agents in the future. All chemicals were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise stated. The gene encoding KdsB from E. coli was cloned into the pET15b expression vector (Novagen). His-tagged protein was produced by overexpression in BL21(DE3) cells (Novagen) at 37 °C for 4 h. Cells were resuspended in binding buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole) and lysed by sonication (four times for 30 s). The enzyme was purified to >95% purity by using a single step purification procedure on a nickel-Sepharose column (Prochem). Proteins were loaded onto the column in binding buffer, washed with binding buffer containing 50 mm imidazole, and eluted with 250 mm imidazole. After elution, the imidazole was removed by dialysis into 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, and the protein was concentrated using stirred concentrator cells (Amicon). Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay with bovine serum albumin as standard. Typical protein yields were ∼60 mg from a 1-liter culture. The synthesis of 2β-deoxy-Kdo is outlined schematically in Fig. 2. First, the Cornforth synthesis of Kdo 3 from d-arabinose 1 and oxaloacetic acid 2 (17.Cornforth J.W. Firth M.E. Gottschalk A. J. Biochem. 1958; 68: 57-61Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 18.Hershberger C. Davis M. Binkley S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 1585-1588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was repeated. During this procedure, it was necessary to control the reaction pH very closely, and the addition of NiCl2 (19.Ogura H. Shirai R. Tetrahedron Lett. 1989; 30: 2263-2264Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar) proved beneficial. The crude Kdo 3 product was progressed by acetylation and esterification to the mixture of fully protected α/β anomers 4, which was then converted into 2β-deoxy-Kdo 7 using a slight modification of a published procedure (20.Luthman K. Orbe M. Wåglund T. Claesson A. J. Org. Chem. 1987; 52: 3777-3784Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In brief, the anomeric esters were converted to the anomeric chlorides 5 using TiCl4, and the halogen was removed by hydrogenolysis in the presence of pyridine. It was easiest to separate the α/β anomers at this stage; the desired fully protected 2β-deoxy compound 6 was obtained crystalline and in high purity. Deacetylation of 6 under Zemplen conditions followed by hydrolysis of the methyl ester afforded inhibitor 2β-deoxy-Kdo 7, which was isolated by ion exchange as its crystalline ammonium salt; this form was used in all subsequent experiments (see supplemental material for characterization of the final product). The concentration of CTP was determined using an extinction coefficient in aqueous solution of 9 mm−1 cm−1 at 271 nm. The activity of KdsB was measured by following the formation of pyrophosphate as it is released during the reaction using the EnzChek pyrophosphate assay kit (Invitrogen). In these assays the pyrophosphate is first split into two molecules of phosphate by inorganic pyrophosphatase, which is then utilized by the enzyme purine ribonucleoside phosphorylase in a reaction that has an accompanying absorbance change at 360 nm. The amount of pyrophosphate produced during the assay was quantified by comparison with a pyrophosphate standard curve. A Cary 50 UV-visible spectrophotometer (Varian) was used to measure the initial rates of pyrophosphate production of 10 nm KdsB in 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2 over a range of substrate concentrations. The Km and Vmax values were obtained by fitting the initial rates of pyrophosphate synthesis against the concentrations of each substrate to Equation 1 by nonlinear regression analysis using the SigmaPlot program (SPSS Inc), v=(Vmax[CTP][Kdo])([CTP][Kdo]+KCTP[Kdo]+KKdo[CTP]+c)(Eq. 1) where v is the initial rate; [CTP] and [Kdo] are the substrate concentrations; Vmax is the initial rate achieved as both [CTP] and [Kdo] approach ∞; KKdo is the value of [Kdo] giving Vmax/2 as [CTP] approaches ∞; KCTP is the value of [CTP] giving Vmax/2 as [Kdo] approaches ∞; and c is a constant. For inhibition assays with 2β-deoxy-Kdo, the initial rates of pyrophosphate production of 10 nm KdsB in 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2 were measured over a range of Kdo concentrations and at variable concentrations of 2β-deoxy-Kdo. Data for the inhibition studies were fitted to Equation 2 for competitive inhibition, and standard errors were calculated by nonlinear regression analysis using the SigmaPlot program (SPSS Inc), v=(Vmax[Kdo])(KKdo(1+[I]/Ki)+[Kdo])(Eq. 2) where v is the initial rate;[Kdo] is the concentration of Kdo; Vmax is the initial rate achieved as [Kdo] approaches ∞; KKdo is the value of [Kdo] giving Vmax/2; [I] is the concentration of the 2β-deoxy-Kdo inhibitor; and Ki is the inhibition constant. All of the steady-state rates were measured in duplicate. ITC experiments were performed using a VP-ITC microcalorimeter (Microcal Inc.) at 25 °C. Protein samples were dialyzed into 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5. Aliquots (10 μl) of 100 μm 2β-deoxy-Kdo were titrated into 1.28 ml of 100 μm KdsB and 100 μm CTP at 420-s intervals with a stirring speed of 350 rpm. Parallel experiments were performed by injecting the inhibitor into the buffer. The heats of dilution were negligible and subtracted from their respective titrations prior to data analysis. Thermodynamic parameters n (stoichiometry), Kd (1/Ka, the association constant), and ΔH0 (enthalpy change) were obtained by nonlinear least squares fitting of experimental data using the single-site binding model of the Origin software package (version 7.0) provided with the instrument. The free energy of binding (ΔG0) and entropy change (ΔS0) were obtained using Equations 3 and 4, ΔG0=-RTlnKA(Eq. 3) ΔG0=ΔH0-TΔS0(Eq. 4) KdsB was crystallized in the presence and absence of ligands by the sitting drop technique at 4 °C by adding 2 μl of mother liquor to 2 μl of KdsB (14.5 mg ml−1). For the ligand-free enzyme, crystals were produced using 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.6, 250 mm sodium sulfate, 15% (v/v) glycerol as a reservoir solution. Ligand-bound crystals were produced in the presence of 5 mm CTP and 5 mm 2β-deoxy-Kdo, using 85 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 17% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 10000, 6.8% ethylene glycol, 15% (v/v) glycerol as a reservoir solution. Crystals were mounted on a nylon loop and flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. Data were collected from single cryofrozen crystals of the unbound (2.5 Å) and ligand complexed (1.9 Å) forms of KdsB at Diamond. The data were scaled and integrated using XDS (21.Kabsch W. J. Appl.

Open table in a new tab Continuous wave EPR spectra were run at X-band using a Bruker ELEXSYS E500 spectrometer in conjunction with an Oxford Instruments ESR900 cryostat and ITC503 temperature controller. The microwave power was 50 microwatts; the modulation frequency was 100 kHz, and the modulation amplitude was 5 G. Each spectrum presented is the sum of four scans accumulated at a temperature of 20 K. 250-μl samples of 280 μm KdsB in 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, in the presence of either 280 or 560 μm MnCl2 were used for EPR measurements. Various combinations of 5 mm CTP and 5 mm 2β-deoxy-Kdo were also included when indicated. Chain A of the KdsB-CTP-2β-deoxy-Kdo crystal structure was used as a starting point for all molecular dynamics simulations and energy minimizations. A second Mg2+ cation was added in the proposed Mg-A position. The models were immersed in a TIP3 water box (27.Jorgensen W.L. Chandrasekhar J. Madura J.D. Impey R.W. Klein M.L. J. Chem.

The cutoff parameter for the computation of nonbonded interactions was set to 12 Å, and the electrostatic forces were softened by defining a relative dielectric constant of 2 for the system. Several cycles (up to five) of energy minimization (1000 steps, conjugate gradient), followed by molecular dynamics simulations (200 ps at 200 K) were performed to stabilize the enzyme-ligand complex and obtain the final models. A major limitation of previous studies with KdsB and the related enzyme, KpsU, has been the inability to measure steady-state enzyme activity using continuous assay methods. We have now developed a new linked assay for the enzyme, which allows us to monitor the continuous formation of the pyrophosphate product as it is released during the reaction (supplemental Fig. S1). Consequently, this has enabled us to determine the true kinetic parameters for the enzyme by measuring the initial rate of pyrophosphate formation over a range of CTP and Kdo concentrations. The dependence of the initial rate on substrate concentration, shown graphically in Fig. 3A, followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics and reveals a ternary complex steady-state mechanism (supplemental Fig. S2). Under the conditions used, the Vmax was determined to be 2.3 ± 0.01 μm min−1, which corresponds to a kcat value of 3.8 ± 0.02 s−1 (assuming that the enzyme is 100% active). The Km for Kdo was calculated to be 97.9 ± 10.4 μm, and the Km for CTP was calculated to be 4.8 ± 0.5 μm. These values differ slightly to those obtained in an earlier study where Km values were calculated to be 290 μm for Kdo and 200 μm for CTP, although it should be noted that the previous parameters were measured by using stopped assays at an elevated pH of 9.5 (4.Ray P.H. Benedict C.D. Grasmuk H. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 145: 1273-1280Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, previous studies have also shown that in solution Kdo is a mixture of pyranose and furanose forms with ∼2% in the β-pyranose form (32.Brade H. Zähringer U. Rietschel E.T. Christian R. Schulz G. Unger F.M. Carbohydr. Res. 1984; 134: 157-166Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar) that is accepted by KdsB (33.Kohlbrenner W.E. Fesik S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14695-14700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the Km value that has been calculated for Kdo is significantly higher than the true value, which is likely to be ∼2 μm. Previous studies have identified a number of inhibitors of the enzyme that are based on the structure of 2β-deoxy-Kdo (Fig. 2) (10.Claesson A. Luthman K. Gustafsson K. Bondesson G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 143: 1063-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 11.Goldman R. Kohlbrenner W. Lartey P. Pernet A. Nature. 1987; 329: 162-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 12.Hammond S.M. Claesson A. Jansson A.M. Larsson L.G. Pring B.G. Town C.M. Ekström B. Nature. 1987; 327: 730-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Consequently, we have carried out detailed kinetic inhibition studies with this compound using the new continuous assay that we have developed. The initial rates of pyrophosphate formation have been measured over a range of Kdo and 2β-deoxy-Kdo concentrations, which is shown graphically in Fig. 3B. These studies reveal that 2β-deoxy-Kdo acts as a potent competitive inhibitor with the Kdo substrate of the enzyme (supplemental Fig. S3) with a Ki of 2.03 ± 0.08 μm. In addition, ITC experiments have been used to measure the binding of the 2β-deoxy-Kdo inhibitor to the enzyme. Fig. 3C represents the ITC binding isotherms resulting from the titration of KdsB with 2β-deoxy-Kdo in the presence of CTP. The binding process was exothermic, and the isotherms could be fitted to a single-site model, yielding a complex dissociation constant of 1.7 ± 0.53 μm, which is very similar to the Ki value calculated from the earlier competitive inhibition measurements. The thermodynamic binding parameters were calculated using Equations 3 and 4, yielding an enthalpy change, ΔH0, of −1.29 ± 0.08 kJ mol−1 and an entropy change, ΔS0, of 22.1 ± 1.8 J K−1. Additional kinetic inhibition studies at a range of CTP concentrations have shown that 2β-deoxy-Kdo acts a noncompetitive inhibitor against the CTP substrate (supplemental Fig. S3). Moreover, similar measurements using the CTP analogue, CMP, revealed that this compound acted as a competitive inhibitor against CTP, with a Ki of 1.30 ± 0.58 mm, and as a noncompetitive inhibitor against the Kdo substrate (supplemental Fig. S4). This pattern of inhibition is consistent with a compulsory order ternary complex mechanism rather than a random order mechanism. The crystal of ligand-free KdsB contains two dimers in the asymmetric unit (see supplemental Fig. S6). The individual monomers are highly similar in fold to the structure of the capsule-specific KdsB (13.Jelakovic S. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 143-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 14.Jelakovic S. Schulz G.E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1174-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and consists of a central 7-stranded β-sheet surrounded by α-helices (Fig. 4A). The structure has a distinct cleft that separates the CTP-binding domain from the dimer interface domain, which is proposed to be involved in sugar binding. An overlay of the four individual monomers reveals that they all adopt an “open” conformation with little difference in backbone conformation, except for the Asp163–Phe178 loop at the dimer interface, which has a conformation that is dependent on the crystal packing environment. Significantly higher B-factors are observed for sections of the CTP-binding domain, including the phosphate-binding PP-loop Arg10–Lys19, the C-terminal α-helix Gln227–Ala245, and the Arg69–Ser74 loop region. A 2.6 Å structure for the ligand-free E. coli lipopolysaccharide-specific KdsB in a different space group has been deposited in the PDB data base (code 1VH1) by a structural genomics consortium. This structure reveals an essentially identical conformation of the dimer interface, with minor deviation in the position of the CTP-binding domain indicating a high degree of flexibility in the relative position of the CTP-binding and dimerization domains. Furthermore, due to higher average B-factors, several loops in the CTP-binding domain have not been modeled. The 1.9 Å crystal structure of the KdsB-CTP-2β-deoxy-Kdo ternary complex also contains two dimers in the asymmetric unit. No significant difference can be observed between the individual monomers that all adopt a “closed” conformation (Fig. 5A). This structure is related to the open conformation by an ∼13° rotation of the CTP-binding domain around hinge regions 80–81, 95–96, 106–107, and 225–233 (as determined by DynDom (34.Nudler E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2009; 78: 335-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar)) leading to a maximal shift in position of ∼9 Å for PP-loop residue Arg15. In addition, the PP-loop changes conformation to establish a network of polar contact with the CTP phosphates. Electron density is clearly visible for both the bound CTP as well as 2β-deoxy-Kdo within the active site cleft (Fig. 4B). In addition, a Mg2+ ion can be readily identified bound to the CTP phosphates. 2β-Deoxy-Kdo is bound at the interface between the dimerization domain and the CTP-binding domain through predominantly polar interactions. Many of the interactions with residues from the dimerization domain (e.g. Arg157, His181, Tyr185, Gln210, and Glu211) do not appear to significantly alter the KdsB structure when compared with the ligand-free KdsB structure (Fig. 5). However, interactions made with residues from the CTP-binding domain are clearly formed concomitant with conversion from the open to the closed conformation. The strictly conserved Gln98 establishes a double hydrogen bond with the sugar ligand that requires a shift in the Gln98 backbone position, leading to extended β-sheet interactions between strands β6 and β10 from the dimerization domain. In addition, a putative charged interaction is established between the PP-loop Arg15 and the 2β-deoxy-Kdo carboxylate that similarly requires the open to closed transformation to occur. In addition to the direct interactions between the CTP-binding domain residues and 2β-deoxy-Kdo itself, a complex network of (water-mediated) polar interactions is established between 2β-deoxy-Kdo and the bound CTP and Mg2+ ion. CTP is predominantly bound through interactions with residues from the CTP-binding domain, with exception of a charged interaction between the γ-phosphate and Arg164 from the dimerization domain of the opposite monomer (Fig. 5). The cytosine base and ribose moiety are bound in a highly similar manner to previously determined CTP or CMP complexes with the related capsule-specific KdsB isozyme (homology 46% identity over 249 amino acids; PDB codes 1GQ9 and 1GQC) or CMP-acylneuraminate synthase (homology 29% identity over 117 amino acids; PDB codes 1QWJ, 1EYR, and 1EZI) with Arg78 largely responsible for cytosine specificity (13.Jelakovic S.

https://openalex.org/W2167784424,"Many tumors are associated with decreased cellular immunity and elevated levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a known inhibitor of CD4+ T cell activation and inducer of type-2 cytokine bias. However, the role of this immunomodulator in the survival of T helper cells remained unclear. Since CD4+ T cells play critical roles in cell-mediated immunity, detail knowledge of the effect tumor-derived PGE2 might have on CD4+ T cell survival and the underlying mechanism may, therefore, help to overcome the overall immune deviation in cancer.By culturing purified human peripheral CD4+ T cells or Jurkat cells with spent media of theaflavin- or celecoxib-pre-treated MCF-7 cells, we show that tumor-shed PGE2 severely impairs interleukin 2 receptor gammac (IL2Rgammac)-mediated survival signaling in CD4+ T cells. Indeed, tumor-shed PGE2 down-regulates IL2Rgammac expression, reduces phosphorylation as well as activation of Janus kinase 3 (Jak-3)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (Stat-5) and decreases Bcl-2/Bax ratio thereby leading to activation of intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Constitutively active Stat-5A (Stat-5A1 6) over-expression efficiently elevates Bcl-2 levels in CD4+ T cells and protects them from tumor-induced death while dominant-negative Stat-5A over-expression fails to do so, indicating the importance of Stat-5A-signaling in CD4+ T cell survival. Further support towards the involvement of PGE2 comes from the results that (a) purified synthetic PGE2 induces CD4+ T cell apoptosis, and (b) when knocked out by small interfering RNA, cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2)-defective tumor cells fail to initiate death. Interestingly, the entire phenomena could be reverted back by theaflavins that restore cytokine-dependent IL2Rgammac/Jak-3/Stat-5A signaling in CD4+ T cells thereby protecting them from tumor-shed PGE2-induced apoptosis.These data strongly suggest that tumor-shed PGE2 is an important factor leading to CD4+ T cell apoptosis during cancer and raise the possibility that theaflavins may have the potential as an effective immunorestorer in cancer-bearer."
https://openalex.org/W2155919744,"Thrombin and fibrillar collagen are potent activators of platelets at sites of vascular injury. Both agonists cause platelet shape change, granule secretion, and aggregation to form the primary hemostatic plug. Human platelets express two thrombin receptors, protease-activated receptors 1 and 4 (PAR1 and PAR4) and two collagen receptors, the alpha(2)beta(1) integrin (alpha(2)beta(1)) and the glycoprotein VI (GPVI)/FcRgamma chain complex. Although these receptors and their signaling mechanisms have been intensely studied, it is not known whether and how these receptors cooperate in the hemostatic function of platelets. This study examined cooperation between the thrombin and collagen receptors in platelet adhesion by utilizing a collagen-related peptide (alpha2-CRP) containing the alpha(2)beta(1)-specific binding motif, GFOGER, in conjunction with PAR-activating peptides. We demonstrate that platelet adhesion to alpha2-CRP is substantially enhanced by suboptimal PAR activation (agonist concentrations that do not stimulate platelet aggregation) using the PAR4 agonist peptide and thrombin. The enhanced adhesion induced by suboptimal PAR4 activation was alpha(2)beta(1)-dependent and GPVI/FcRgamma-independent as revealed in experiments with alpha(2)beta(1)- or FcRgamma-deficient mouse platelets. We further show that suboptimal activation of other platelet G(q)-linked G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) produces enhanced platelet adhesion to alpha2-CRP. The enhanced alpha(2)beta(1)-mediated platelet adhesion is controlled by phospholipase C (PLC), but is not dependent on granule secretion, activation of alpha(IIb)beta(3) integrin, or on phosphoinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) activity. In conclusion, we demonstrate a platelet priming mechanism initiated by suboptimal activation of PAR4 or other platelet G(q)-linked GPCRs through a PLC-dependent signaling cascade that promotes enhanced alpha(2)beta(1) binding to collagens containing GFOGER sites."
https://openalex.org/W1967265654,"It is unclear whether the cellular origin of various forms of pancreatic cancer involves transformation or transdifferentiation of different target cells or whether tumors arise from common precursors, with tumor types determined by the specific genetic alterations. Previous studies suggested that pancreatic ductal carcinomas might be induced by polyoma middle T antigen (PyMT) expressed in non-ductal cells. To ask whether PyMT transforms and transdifferentiates endocrine cells toward exocrine tumor phenotypes, we generated transgenic mice that carry tetracycline-inducible PyMT and a linked luciferase reporter. Induction of PyMT in β cells causes β-cell hyperplastic lesions that do not progress to malignant neoplasms. When PyMT is de-induced, β cell proliferation and growth cease; however, regression does not occur, suggesting that continued production of PyMT is not required to maintain the viable expanded β cell population. In contrast, induction of PyMT in early pancreatic progenitor cells under the control of Pdx1 produces acinar cell carcinomas and β-cell hyperplasia. The survival of acinar tumor cells is dependent on continued expression of PyMT. Our findings indicate that PyMT can induce exocrine tumors from pancreatic progenitor cells, but cells in the β cell lineage are not transdifferentiated toward exocrine cell types by PyMT; instead, they undergo oncogene-dependent hyperplastic growth, but do not require PyMT for survival."
https://openalex.org/W1994659980,"In the 1950s, Reed and coworkers discovered an enzyme activity in Streptococcus faecalis (Enterococcus faecalis) extracts that inactivated the Escherichia. coli and E. faecalis pyruvate dehydrogenase complexes through cleavage of the lipoamide bond. The enzyme that caused this lipoamidase activity remained unidentified until Jiang and Cronan discovered the gene encoding lipoamidase (Lpa) through the screening of an expression library. Subsequent cloning and characterization of the recombinant enzyme revealed that lipoamidase is an 80 kDa protein composed of an amidase domain containing a classic Ser-Ser-Lys catalytic triad and a carboxy-terminal domain of unknown function. Here, we show that the amidase domain can be used as an in vivo probe which specifically inactivates lipoylated enzymes.We evaluated whether Lpa could function as an inducible probe of alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase inactivation using E. coli as a model system. Lpa expression resulted in cleavage of lipoic acid from the three lipoylated proteins expressed in E. coli, but did not result in cleavage of biotin from the sole biotinylated protein, the biotin carboxyl carrier protein. When expressed in lipoylation deficient E. coli, Lpa is not toxic, indicating that Lpa does not interfere with any other critical metabolic pathways. When truncated to the amidase domain, Lpa retained lipoamidase activity without acquiring biotinidase activity, indicating that the carboxy-terminal domain is not essential for substrate recognition or function. Substitution of any of the three catalytic triad amino acids with alanine produced inactive Lpa proteins.The enzyme lipoamidase is active against a broad range of lipoylated proteins in vivo, but does not affect the growth of lipoylation deficient E. coli. Lpa can be truncated to 60% of its original size with only a partial loss of activity, resulting in a smaller probe that can be used to study the effects of alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase inactivation in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2093177031,"Autosomal dominant mutations in the SFTPC gene are associated with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a progressive lethal interstitial lung disease. Mutations that cause misfolding of the encoded proprotein surfactant protein C (SP-C) trigger endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation, a pathway that segregates terminally misfolded substrate for retrotranslocation to the cytosol and degradation by proteasome. Microarray screens for genes involved in SP-C ER-associated degradation identified MKS3/TMEM67, a locus previously linked to the ciliopathy Meckel-Gruber syndrome. In this study, MKS3 was identified as a membrane glycoprotein predominantly localized to the ER. Expression of MKS3 was up-regulated by genetic or pharmacological inducers of ER stress. The ER lumenal domain of MKS3 interacted with a complex that included mutant SP-C and associated chaperones, whereas the region predicted to encode the transmembrane domains of MKS3 interacted with cytosolic p97. Deletion of the transmembrane and cytosolic domains abrogated interaction of MKS3 with p97 and resulted in accumulation of mutant SP-C proprotein; knockdown of MKS3 also inhibited degradation of mutant SP-C. These results support a model in which MKS3 links the ER lumenal quality control machinery with the cytosolic degradation apparatus."
https://openalex.org/W2035735450,"Recent advances in de novo protein evolution have made it possible to create synthetic proteins from unbiased libraries that fold into stable tertiary structures with predefined functions. However, it is not known whether such proteins will be functional when expressed inside living cells or how a host organism would respond to an encounter with a non-biological protein. Here, we examine the physiology and morphology of Escherichia coli cells engineered to express a synthetic ATP-binding protein evolved entirely from non-biological origins. We show that this man-made protein disrupts the normal energetic balance of the cell by altering the levels of intracellular ATP. This disruption cascades into a series of events that ultimately limit reproductive competency by inhibiting cell division. We now describe a detailed investigation into the synthetic biology of this man-made protein in a living bacterial organism, and the effect that this protein has on normal cell physiology."
