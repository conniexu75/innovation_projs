https://openalex.org/W2056102163,"The TAZ transcription co-activator promotes cell proliferation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. TAZ is inhibited by the Hippo tumor suppressor pathway, which promotes TAZ cytoplasmic localization by phosphorylation. We report here that TAZ protein stability is controlled by a phosphodegron recognized by the F-box protein β-TrCP and ubiquitylated by the SCF/CRL1(β-TrCP) E3 ligase. The interaction between TAZ and β-TrCP is regulated by the Hippo pathway. Phosphorylation of a phosphodegron in TAZ by LATS primes it for further phosphorylation by CK1ε and subsequent binding by β-TrCP. Therefore, the Hippo pathway negatively regulates TAZ function by both limiting its nuclear accumulation and promoting its degradation. The phosphodegron-mediated TAZ degradation plays an important role in negatively regulating TAZ biological functions."
https://openalex.org/W2071411183,"Many liver cells are polyploid, containing 4, 8, 16 or more times the haploid chromosome complement, although the significance of the phenomenon is not known. A study in mice now shows that hepatocytes can both increase and decrease their ploidy in vivo. Ploidy reversal was previously thought to be exclusive to meiosis, but this work shows that it can also occur in normal somatic cells. Increases in ploidy occur through failed cytokinesis, and decreases as a result of multipolar mitosis. The resulting genetic heterogeneity might be advantageous following hepatic injury when 'genetically robust' cells could be selected from a pre-existing pool of diverse genotypes. Cells that make up the liver are known to be polyploid. These authors show that mouse hepatocytes can increase and decrease their ploidy in vivo; increases occur as a result of failed cytokinesis, and decreases occur as a result of multipolar mitosis. The resulting genetic heterogeneity might be advantageous following hepatic injury, allowing the selection of 'genetically robust' cells from a pre-existing pool of diverse genotypes. Mononucleated and binucleated polyploid hepatocytes (4n, 8n, 16n and higher) are found in all mammalian species, but the functional significance of this conserved phenomenon remains unknown1,2,3,4. Polyploidization occurs through failed cytokinesis, begins at weaning in rodents and increases with age2,5,6,7. Previously, we demonstrated that the opposite event, ploidy reversal, also occurs in polyploid hepatocytes generated by artificial cell fusion8,9,10. This raised the possibility that somatic ‘reductive mitoses’ can also happen in normal hepatocytes. Here we show that multipolar mitotic spindles form frequently in mouse polyploid hepatocytes and can result in one-step ploidy reversal to generate offspring with halved chromosome content. Proliferating hepatocytes produce a highly diverse population of daughter cells with multiple numerical chromosome imbalances as well as uniparental origins. Our findings support a dynamic model of hepatocyte polyploidization, ploidy reversal and aneuploidy, a phenomenon that we term the ‘ploidy conveyor’. We propose that this mechanism evolved to generate genetic diversity and permits adaptation of hepatocytes to xenobiotic or nutritional injury."

MATE transporters were the only remaining class of multidrug resistance transporter whose structure was not known. The X-ray structure of a prototypical MATE protein, NorM from Vibrio cholerae, has now been determined to 3.65 Å resolution, revealing a protein topology distinct from other membrane-protein structures solved to date. The structure is in an 'outward-facing' conformation, with a cation-binding site in close proximity to residues previously deemed critical for transport. Transporter proteins from the MATE (multidrug and toxic compound extrusion) family are involved in metabolite transport in plants, and in multiple-drug resistance in bacteria and mammals. Here, the X-ray crystal structure of a MATE transporter from Vibrio cholerae is reported. The structure is in an outward-facing conformation, and reveals a cation-binding site near to residues previously deemed essential for transport. Transporter proteins from the MATE (multidrug and toxic compound extrusion)1 family are vital in metabolite transport in plants2,3, directly affecting crop yields worldwide4. MATE transporters also mediate multiple-drug resistance (MDR) in bacteria and mammals5, modulating the efficacy of many pharmaceutical drugs used in the treatment of a variety of diseases6,7,8,9. MATE transporters couple substrate transport to electrochemical gradients and are the only remaining class of MDR transporters whose structure has not been determined10. Here we report the X-ray structure of the MATE transporter NorM from Vibrio cholerae determined to 3.65 Å, revealing an outward-facing conformation with two portals open to the outer leaflet of the membrane and a unique topology of the predicted 12 transmembrane helices distinct from any other known MDR transporter. We also report a cation-binding site in close proximity to residues previously deemed critical for transport11. This conformation probably represents a stage of the transport cycle with high affinity for monovalent cations and low affinity for substrates."

Loss of podocytes contributes to albuminuria, a major risk factor for progression of kidney disease. Here, we show that HG inactivates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), up-regulates Nox4, enhances NADPH oxidase activity, and induces podocyte apoptosis. Activation of AMPK blocked HG-induced expression of Nox4, NADPH oxidase activity, and apoptosis. We also identified the tumor suppressor protein p53 as a mediator of podocyte apoptosis in cells exposed to HG. Inactivation of AMPK by HG up-regulated the expression and phosphorylation of p53, and p53 acted downstream of Nox4. To investigate the mechanism of podocyte apoptosis in vivo, we used OVE26 mice, a model of type 1 diabetes. Glomeruli isolated from these mice showed decreased phosphorylation of AMPK and enhanced expression of Nox4 and p53. Pharmacologic activation of AMPK by 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-riboside in OVE26 mice attenuated Nox4 and p53 expression. Administration of 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-riboside also prevented renal hypertrophy, glomerular basement thickening, foot process effacement, and podocyte loss, resulting in marked reduction in albuminuria. Our results uncover a novel function of AMPK that integrates metabolic input to Nox4 and provide new insight for activation of p53 to induce podocyte apoptosis. The data indicate the potential therapeutic utility of AMPK activators to block Nox4 and reactive oxygen species generation and to reduce urinary albumin excretion in type 1 diabetes.

More recently, along with ROS generated from mitochondrial respiratory chains, NADPH oxidase-derived ROS have been shown to play a significant role in injury to various organs, including the kidney (2Eid A.A.

A number of homologs of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase catalytic subunit (Nox2) have been identified. These enzymes participate in a number of biological processes, including proliferation, migration, contraction, cytoskeletal organization, fibrosis, and apoptosis (8Lassègue B. Griendling K.K.

High glucose (HG) increases the expression of Nox4 and NADPH oxidase activity in podocytes (2Eid A.A. Gorin Y. Fagg B.M. Maalouf R. Barnes J.L. Block K. Abboud H.E. Diabetes. 2009; 58: 1201-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which glucose increases NADPH oxidase activity and the role of Nox4 in podocyte apoptosis are not known. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a serine/threonine kinase, is an energy sensor whose activity is regulated by glucose (11Long Y.C. Zierath J.R. J. Clin.

Seven AMPK genes encoding two α (α1 and α2), two β (β1 and β2), and three γ (γ1, γ2, and γ3) isoforms are present in the mammalian genome (16Rutter G.A. Da Silva Xavier G. Leclerc I. Biochem.

The activity and subunit composition of AMPK are expressed in a cell- and tissue-specific manner, with the α1- and α2-subunits expressed in the kidney and in glomerular cells (19Cammisotto P.G. Bendayan M. J. Mol. Histol. 2008; 39: 579-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Activation of AMPK requires phosphorylation of a critical threonine residue (Thr172) in the activation loop of the α-subunit (20Hawley S.A. Davison M. Woods A. Davies S.P. Beri R.K. Carling D.

In energy depletion states, AMPK activation slows metabolic reactions that consume ATP and stimulates reactions that produce ATP, thereby restoring the AMP/ATP ratio and the normal cellular energy stores (21Kahn B.B.

In this study, we provide the first evidence that inactivation of AMPK by HG increases the expression of Nox4 and that the increased expression of Nox4 mediates podocyte apoptosis. Additionally, we demonstrate that Nox4 increases the abundance of p53 protein concomitant with an increase in its phosphorylation at Ser46 to increase the expression of the pro-apoptotic protein PUMA (p53-up-regulated modulator of apoptosis). In type 1 diabetic mice, AMPK is inactivated and up-regulates Nox4 to induce podocyte apoptosis. Furthermore, we show that pharmacologic activation of AMPK prevents these changes in vitro in podocytes and in vivo in diabetic mice and attenuates albuminuria. Conditionally immortalized mouse podocytes, kindly provided by Dr. Katalin Susztack (Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY), were cultured as described previously (2Eid A.A. Gorin Y.

For the RNA interference experiments, a SMARTpool consisting of siRNA duplexes specific for mouse LKB1 or mouse p53 was obtained from Dharmacon. The SMARTpool of siRNAs was introduced into the cells by double transfection using Oligofectamine or Lipofectamine 2000 as described previously (34Gorin Y. Ricono J.M. Wagner B. Kim N.H. Bhandari B. Choudhury G.G. Abboud H.E. Biochem. J. 2004; 381: 231-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The siRNAs for LKB1 and p53 were used at a concentration of 100 nm. Scrambled siRNAs (nontargeting siRNAs; 100 nm) served as controls to validate the specificity of the siRNAs. A replication-defective adenoviral vector encoding a truncated form of Nox4 lacking the NADPH-binding domain (referred to as AdDN-Nox4), a generous gift from Dr. Barry Goldstein (Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA), was amplified in HEK293 cells. A GFP adenoviral vector control (referred to as AdGFP) was used as a control virus. Infection of cultured podocytes was carried out for 48 h. Wild-type active AMPKα2 (WT-AMPKα2) or dominant-negative AMPKα2 (DN-AMPKα2) plasmid constructs were procured from Addgene (35Mu J. Brozinick Jr., J.T. Valladares O. Bucan M. Birnbaum M.J. Mol.

Podocytes were transfected with 1.0 µg of WT-AMPKα2, DN-AMPKα2, or vector plasmid constructs using Lipofectamine 2000. 22-Week-old control FVB mice and OVE26 mice (FVB background; The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were used. At 17 weeks of age, OVE26 mice were treated with aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-riboside 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-riboside (AICAR; 750 mg/kg/day) administered by intraperitoneal route (36Lemieux K. Konrad D. Klip A. Marette A. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1658-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Before treatment with AICAR, mice were placed in metabolic cages for urine collection. Urine albumin was measured using a mouse albumin ELISA quantification kit (Bethyl Laboratories) and expressed as micrograms of albumin/24 h. Animals are killed by exsanguination under anesthesia. Both kidneys were removed and weighed. A slice of kidney cortex at the pole was embedded in paraffin or flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen for microscopy and image analyses. Cortical tissue was used for isolation of glomeruli by differential sieving with minor modifications as described previously (2Eid A.A. Gorin Y. Fagg B.M. Maalouf R. Barnes J.L. Block K. Abboud H.E.

Cultured podocytes were washed five times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped from the plate in the same solution, followed by centrifugation at 800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm KH2PO4 (pH 7.0), 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 µg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5 µg/ml leupeptin). Cell suspensions or washed glomeruli were homogenized with 100 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer on ice. To start the assay, 20 µg of homogenates was added to 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 1 mm EGTA, 150 mm sucrose, 5 µm lucigenin, and 100 µm NADPH. Photon emission expressed as relative light units was measured every 20 or 30 s for 10 min in a luminometer. A buffer blank (<5% of the cell signal) was subtracted from each reading. Superoxide production was expressed as relative light units/min/mg of protein. Protein content was measured using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. AMPK activity was measured using the AMPK KinEASETM FP fluorescein green assay fluorescence polarization assay (Millipore) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Endogenous LKB1 was immunoprecipitated with an antibody against LKB1 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) and protein G beads. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 100 µl of kinase buffer containing 1 mm ATP, 10 µCi of [32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and 300 µm LKBtide (Upstate) into tubes containing the immunoprecipitated sample. After incubation at 30 °C for 10 or 20 min, the supernatant was applied to P81 paper (Whatman), and 32P incorporation was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Homogenates from glomeruli isolated from renal cortex were prepared in 200 µl of radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 µg/ml aprotinin, 20 µg/ml leupeptin, and 1% Nonidet P-40) using a Dounce homogenizer. Homogenates were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Mouse podocytes were grown to near confluency in 60- or 100-mm dishes and serum-deprived for 24 h. All incubations were carried out in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.2% BSA (fatty acid-free) at 37 °C for a specified duration. The cells were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer at 4 °C for 30 min. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Protein in the supernatants was measured using the Bio-Rad method. For immunoblotting, proteins (30–60 µg) were separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Blots were incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-Nox4 (1:1000; Novus Biologicals), rabbit monoclonal phospho-Thr172 AMPKα (40H9; 1:1000; Cell Signaling), rabbit polyclonal anti-AMPKα (1:1000; Cell Signaling), rabbit monoclonal phospho-Ser428 LKB1 (C67A3; 1:1000; Cell Signaling), rabbit polyclonal LKB1 (1:1000; Abcam), and rabbit polyclonal anti-p53 (1:1000; Cell Signaling) antibodies. The primary antibodies were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG (1:2500 or 1:5000). Bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. Densitometric analysis was performed using NIH Image software. mRNA was analyzed by real-time RT-PCR using the ΔΔCt method. Total RNA was isolated from cultured mouse podocytes or isolated glomeruli using the RNeasy® minikit (Qiagen). mRNA expression was quantified using the Mastercycler realplex (Eppendorf, Westbury, NY) with SYBR Green dye and predesigned mouse RT2-quantitative PCR primers (SABiosciences, Frederick, MD) for Nox4 (RefSeq ID NM_015760), Trp53 (RefSeq ID NM_011640), and PUMA (RefSeq ID NM_133234) and normalized to β-actin (RefSeq ID NM_007393). The cellular DNA fragmentation ELISA (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) for detection of BrdU-labeled DNA fragments in culture supernatants and cell lysates was used according to the manufacturer's protocol. An annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection kit (Calbiochem) was used for annexin V and propidium iodide staining according to the manufacturer's protocol. The percentage of apoptotic and necrotic cells was assessed by FACS (San Antonio Cancer Institute Core Facility at University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX). A caspase-3 fluorescence assay kit (Cayman Chemical Co.) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol. Kidney cortex was cut into 0.5–1-mm3 pieces and fixed overnight in cold 4% formaldehyde and 1% glutaraldehyde in phosphate buffer and then embedded in Epon 812 resin. 0.50-mm plastic sections were cut and stained with toluidine blue for identification of representative areas for subsequent sectioning using an ultramicrotome. Ultrathin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and examined and photographed on a JEOL 100CX electron microscope. All EM photomicrographs were examined in a blind fashion. Individual capillary loops were examined and quantified in five glomeruli/group of animals for the degree of foot process effacement as described by Jo et al. (38Jo Y.I. Cheng H. Wang S. Moeckel G.W.

Dual-label immunohistochemistry was used to identify and count glomerular epithelial cells relative to the GBM using a modification of methods described previously (43Faulkner J.L. Szcykalski L.M.

To identify podocytes, 3-µm frozen sections of kidney cortex on glass slides were stained with anti-synaptopodin antibody, followed by Cy3-labeled donkey anti-goat IgG. After washing and to identify the GBM, the sections were stained with a rabbit antibody directed against collagen type IV, followed by FITC-labeled donkey anti-rabbit IgG. After staining and washing, the sections were preserved on coverslips in Prolong® gold antifade mounting medium with DAPI (Invitrogen) for fluorescence detection of nuclei. Sections were examined by epifluorescence using excitation and band-pass filters optimal for FITC, Cy3, and DAPI. Digital images representing each fluorochrome were taken of random glomeruli using an Olympus AX70 research microscope and a DP70 digital camera. 25–35 glomerular cross-sections per animal were photographed in each color channel, providing a minimum of 100 composite images per experimental group. The images were merged and color-balanced using Image-Pro Plus imaging software (Media Cybernetics, Inc., Silver Spring, MD), and podocytes were counted in projected images in a blind fashion by two individuals. Synaptopodin-positive cells on the outer aspect of the GBM were considered glomerular epithelial cells and counted. Synaptopodin-negative cells or cells in the inner aspect of the GBM were not counted. The mean area of each glomerular profile was measured manually, tracing the glomerular outline, encircling the area of interest, and calculating the surface area by computerized morphometry using MetaMorph Version 4.69 (2Eid A.A.

Significance was determined as p < 0.05. The mechanism by which glucose increases NADPH oxidase activity, whether it involves AMPK, and the role of Nox4 in podocyte apoptosis are is not known. As expected, exposure of mouse podocytes to 25 mm HG for 12, 24, and 48 h significantly increased apoptosis as measured by annexin V binding (supplemental Fig. S1A), caspase-3 activation (supplemental Fig. S1B), and cellular DNA fragmentation (supplemental Fig. S1C). An equimolar concentration of mannitol had no effect (supplemental Fig. S1, B and C). Impairment of Nox4 function using an adenovirus encoding a dominant-negative form of the enzyme (AdDN-Nox4) significantly inhibited NADPH oxidase activity (Fig. 1A) and dramatically reduced HG-induced annexin V binding (Fig. 1B), caspase-3 activity (Fig. 1C), and cellular DNA fragmentation (Fig. 1D). These results demonstrate that Nox4-derived ROS mediate apoptosis of podocytes induced by HG. Exposure of mouse podocytes to 25 mm glucose decreased AMPKα phosphorylation at its activating site, Thr172 (supplemental Fig. S2A), concomitant with reduction in AMPK activity (supplemental Fig. S2B). To elucidate the mechanism by which HG inhibits AMPK, we tested the effect of HG on the phosphorylation and activity of LKB1, an upstream kinase that phosphorylates AMPK at Thr172 (46Hong S.P. Leiper F.C. Woods A. Carling D. Carlson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 8839-8843Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). HG decreased LKB1 phosphorylation at Ser428 (supplemental Fig. S2C), a phosphorylation site required for metformin-enhanced AMPK activation (47Xie Z. Dong Y. Scholz R. Neumann D. Zou M.H. Circulation. 2008; 117: 952-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). HG also decreased LKB1 activity (supplemental Fig. S2D). To determine whether the effect of HG on AMPK is mediated by LKB1, podocytes were transfected with siRNA targeting LKB1 prior to treatment with AICAR and HG. In cells incubated with HG, treatment with AICAR restored LKB1 and AMPKα phosphorylation, whereas siRNA targeting LKB1 reversed the effect of AICAR on the phosphorylation of LKB1 and AMPKα (supplemental Fig. S3). These data indicate that the effect of HG in inhibiting AMPK phosphorylation and activity is at least partially due to reduction in LKB1 phosphorylation and activity. To determine whether inactivation of AMPKα mediates HG-induced Nox4 expression and apoptosis, podocytes were exposed to HG in the absence or presence of the AMPKα activator AICAR. Cells in normal glucose were also incubated with the AMPKα inhibitor adenine 9-β-d-arabinofuranoside (ARA). In cells incubated with HG, treatment with AICAR restored AMPKα phosphorylation at Thr172 (Fig. 2A) as well as AMPK activity (Fig. 2B). AICAR treatment also prevented the increase in Nox4 mRNA (Fig. 2C) and protein expression (Fig. 2D) and significantly blocked NADPH oxidase activity in response to HG (Fig. 2E). On the other hand, treatment of cells incubated in normal glucose (NG) with the AMPK inhibitor ARA mimicked the effect of HG and reduced AMPKα phosphorylation (Fig. 2A) and activity (Fig. 2B). Also, ARA resulted in up-regulation of Nox4 mRNA (Fig. 2C) and protein (Fig. 2D) and enhanced NADPH oxidase activity (Fig. 2E) in cells incubated with NG. In parallel experiments, podocytes were transfected with a plasmid overexpressing wild-type AMPKα2 prior to exposure to HG, or cells in NG were transfected with a plasmid overexpressing dominant-negative AMPKα2. Expression of AMPKα2 restored AMPKα phosphorylation (Fig. 2F) and AMPK activity (Fig. 2G) and reduced HG-induced Nox4 mRNA (Fig. 2H) and protein expression (Fig. 2I) as well as NADPH oxidase activity (Fig. 2J), similar to the effect of AICAR. In contrast, in podocytes incubated with NG, the expression of dominant-negative AMPKα2 inhibited phosphorylation and activation of AMPK (Fig. 2, F and G), enhanced expression of Nox4 mRNA (Fig. 2H) and protein (Fig. 2I), and increased NADPH oxidase activity (Fig. 2J), similar to the effects of ARA. These data clearly implicate inactivation of AMPK by HG in the increased expression of Nox4 mRNA and protein and NADPH oxidase activation. We next examined the role of AMPK in apoptosis of podocytes induced by HG. HG significantly augmented annexin V binding, caspase-3 activation, and DNA fragmentation (Fig. 3, A–C). Incubation of podocytes with the AMPK activator AICAR significantly inhibited HG-induced apoptosis (Fig. 3, A–C), whereas the pharmacologic AMPK inhibitor ARA mimicked the effect of HG and induced apoptosis of podocytes in NG (Fig. 3, A–C). To confirm the pharmacologic effect of the AMPK activator and inhibitor, wild-type or dominant-negative AMPKα2 was expressed in podocytes. As observed with AICAR, expression of AMPKα2 inhibited HG-induced annexin V binding, caspase-3 activation, and DNA fragmentation (Fig. 3, D–F). On the other hand, expression of dominant-negative AMPKα2 in podocytes incubated in NG induced significant apoptosis compared with control cells (Fig. 3, D–F). These results indicate that AMPK inactivation by HG mediates podocyte apoptosis. To determine the mechanism by which HG induces podocyte apoptosis, we considered the role of the p53 tumor sup"
https://openalex.org/W2078040721,"β-catenin-dependent Wnt signaling is initiated as Wnt binds to both the receptor FZD and coreceptor LRP5/6, which then assembles a multimeric complex at the cytoplasmic membrane face to recruit and inactivate the kinase GSK3. The large number and sequence diversity of Wnt isoforms suggest the possibility of domain-specific ligand-coreceptor interactions, and distinct binding sites on LRP6 for Wnt3a and Wnt9b have recently been identified in vitro. Whether mechanistically different interactions between Wnts and coreceptors might mediate signaling remains to be determined. It is also not clear whether coreceptor homodimerization induced extracellularly can activate Wnt signaling, as is the case for receptor tyrosine kinases. We generated monoclonal antibodies against LRP6 with the unexpected ability to inhibit signaling by some Wnt isoforms and potentiate signaling by other isoforms. In cell culture, two antibodies characterized further show reciprocal activities on most Wnts, with one antibody antagonizing and the other potentiating. We demonstrate that these antibodies bind to different regions of LRP6 protein, and inhibition of signaling results from blocking Wnt binding. Antibody-mediated dimerization of LRP6 can potentiate signaling only when a Wnt isoform is also able to bind the complex, presumably recruiting FZD. Endogenous autocrine Wnt signaling in different tumor cell lines can be either antagonized or enhanced by the LRP6 antibodies, indicating expression of different Wnt isoforms. As anticipated from the roles of Wnt signaling in cancer and bone development, antibody activities can also be observed in mice for inhibition of tumor growth and in organ culture for enhancement of bone mineral density. Collectively, our results indicate that separate binding sites for different subsets of Wnt isoforms determine the inhibition or potentiation of signaling conferred by LRP6 antibodies. This complexity of coreceptor-ligand interactions may allow for differential regulation of signaling by Wnt isoforms during development, and can be exploited with antibodies to differentially manipulate Wnt signaling in specific tissues or disease states."

Prior to this study, the role of membrane permeabilization in the activity of NaD1, as well as the relevance of cell wall binding, had not been investigated. To address this, the permeabilization of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. vasinfectum hyphae by NaD1 was investigated and compared with that by other antimicrobial peptides, including the cecropin-melittin hybrid peptide CP-29, the bovine peptide BMAP-28, and the human peptide LL-37, which are believed to act largely through membrane disruption. NaD1 appeared to permeabilize cells via a novel mechanism that required the presence of the fungal cell wall.

https://openalex.org/W2026111998,"Symplekin (Pta1 in yeast) is a scaffold in the large protein complex that is required for 3'-end cleavage and polyadenylation of eukaryotic messenger RNA precursors (pre-mRNAs); it also participates in transcription initiation and termination by RNA polymerase II (Pol II). Symplekin mediates interactions between many different proteins in this machinery, although the molecular basis for its function is not known. Here we report the crystal structure at 2.4 Å resolution of the amino-terminal domain (residues 30-340) of human symplekin in a ternary complex with the Pol II carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) Ser 5 phosphatase Ssu72 (refs 7, 10-17) and a CTD Ser 5 phosphopeptide. The N-terminal domain of symplekin has the ARM or HEAT fold, with seven pairs of antiparallel α-helices arranged in the shape of an arc. The structure of Ssu72 has some similarity to that of low-molecular-mass phosphotyrosine protein phosphatase, although Ssu72 has a unique active-site landscape as well as extra structural features at the C terminus that are important for interaction with symplekin. Ssu72 is bound to the concave face of symplekin, and engineered mutations in this interface can abolish interactions between the two proteins. The CTD peptide is bound in the active site of Ssu72, with the pSer 5-Pro 6 peptide bond in the cis configuration, which contrasts with all other known CTD peptide conformations. Although the active site of Ssu72 is about 25 Å from the interface with symplekin, we found that the symplekin N-terminal domain stimulates Ssu72 CTD phosphatase activity in vitro. Furthermore, the N-terminal domain of symplekin inhibits polyadenylation in vitro, but only when coupled to transcription. Because catalytically active Ssu72 overcomes this inhibition, our results show a role for mammalian Ssu72 in transcription-coupled pre-mRNA 3'-end processing."
https://openalex.org/W2041018885,"Virus-encoded microRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to regulate a variety of biological processes involved in viral infection and viral-associated pathogenesis. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a herpesvirus implicated in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and other human malignancies. EBV-encoded miRNAs were among the first group of viral miRNAs identified. To understand the roles of EBV miRNAs in the pathogenesis of NPC, we utilized deep sequencing technology to characterize the EBV miRNA transcriptome in clinical NPC tissues. We obtained more than 110,000 sequence reads in NPC samples and identified 44 EBV BART miRNAs, including four new mature miRNAs derived from previously identified BART miRNA precursor hairpins. Further analysis revealed extensive sequence variations (isomiRs) of EBV miRNAs, including terminal isomiRs at both the 5′ and 3′ ends and nucleotide variants. Analysis of EBV genomic sequences indicated that the majority of EBV miRNA nucleotide variants resulted from post-transcriptional modifications. Read counts of individual EBV miRNA in NPC tissue spanned from a few reads to approximately 18,000 reads, confirming the wide expression range of EBV miRNAs. Several EBV miRNAs were expressed at levels similar to highly abundant human miRNAs. Sequence analysis revealed that most of the highly abundant EBV miRNAs share their seed sequences (nucleotides 2–7) with human miRNAs, suggesting that seed sequence content may be an important factor underlying the differential accumulation of BART miRNAs. Interestingly, many of these human miRNAs have been found to be dysregulated in human malignancies, including NPC. These observations not only provide a potential linkage between EBV miRNAs and human malignancy but also suggest a highly coordinated mechanism through which EBV miRNAs may mimic or compete with human miRNAs to affect cellular functions."
https://openalex.org/W1997976641,"Background We hypothesized that chronic inhibition of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) by cetuximab, a monoclonal anti-EGFR antibody, induces up-regulation of its ligands resulting in resistance and that microRNAs (miRs) play an important role in the ligand regulation in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Methodology/Principal Findings Genome-wide changes in gene and miR expression were determined in cetuximab-sensitive cell line, SCC1, and its resistant derivative 1Cc8 using DNA microarrays and RT-PCR. The effects of differentially expressed EGFR ligands and miRs were examined by MTS, colony formation, ELISA, and western blot assays. Heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF) and its regulator, miR-212, were differentially expressed with statistical significance when SCC1 and 1Cc8 were compared for gene and miR expression. Stimulation with HB-EGF induced cetuximab resistance in sensitive cell lines. Inhibition of HB-EGF and the addition of miR-212 mimic induced cetuximab sensitivity in resistant cell lines. MicroRNA-212 and HB-EGF expression were inversely correlated in an additional 33 HNSCC and keratinocyte cell lines. Six tumors and 46 plasma samples from HNSCC patients were examined for HB-EGF levels. HB-EGF plasma levels were lower in newly diagnosed HNSCC patients when compared to patients with recurrent disease. Conclusions/Significance Increased expression of HB-EGF due to down-regulation of miR-212 is a possible mechanism of cetuximab resistance. The combination of EGFR ligand inhibitors or miR modulators with cetuximab may improve the clinical outcome of cetuximab therapy in HNSCC."
https://openalex.org/W1975449089,"Background Inflammation has been proposed to be important in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy. An early feature of inflammation is the release of cytokines leading to increased expression of endothelial activation markers such as vascular cellular adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1). Here we investigated the impact of diabetes and dyslipidemia on VCAM-1 expression in mouse retinal vessels, as well as the potential role of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα). Methodology/Principal Findings Expression of VCAM-1 was examined by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy in vessels of wild type (wt), hyperlipidemic (ApoE−/−) and TNFα deficient (TNFα−/−, ApoE−/−/TNFα−/−) mice. Eight weeks of streptozotocin-induced diabetes resulted in increased VCAM-1 in wt mice, predominantly in small vessels (<10 µm). Diabetic wt mice had higher total retinal TNFα, IL-6 and IL-1β mRNA than controls; as well as higher soluble VCAM-1 (sVCAM-1) in plasma. Lack of TNFα increased higher basal VCAM-1 protein and sVCAM-1, but failed to up-regulate IL-6 and IL-1β mRNA and VCAM-1 protein in response to diabetes. Basal VCAM-1 expression was higher in ApoE−/− than in wt mice and both VCAM-1 mRNA and protein levels were further increased by high fat diet. These changes correlated to plasma cholesterol, LDL- and HDL-cholesterol, but not to triglycerides levels. Diabetes, despite further increasing plasma cholesterol in ApoE−/− mice, had no effects on VCAM-1 protein expression or on sVCAM-1. However, it increased ICAM-1 mRNA expression in retinal vessels, which correlated to plasma triglycerides. Conclusions/Significance Hyperglycemia triggers an inflammatory response in the retina of normolipidemic mice and up-regulation of VCAM-1 in retinal vessels. Hypercholesterolemia effectively promotes VCAM-1 expression without evident stimulation of inflammation. Diabetes-induced endothelial activation in ApoE−/− mice seems driven by elevated plasma triglycerides but not by cholesterol. Results also suggest a complex role for TNFα in the regulation of VCAM-1 expression, being protective under basal conditions but pro-inflammatory in response to diabetes."

https://openalex.org/W2036202257,"Background Demographic features of dengue fever have changed tremendously in Pakistan over the past two decades. Small scale studies from all over the country have reported different aspects of individual outbreaks during this time. However, there is scarcity of data looking at the overall trend of dengue virus infection in the country. In this study, we examined annual trends, seasonality, and clinical features of dengue fever in the Pakistani population. Methods Demographic information and dengue IgM status of all patients tested for dengue IgM antibody at Aga Khan University Hospital from January 2003 to December 2007 were analyzed to look for trends of IgM-positive cases in Pakistan. In addition, clinical and biochemical parameters were abstracted retrospectively from medical records of all patients hospitalized with IgM-proven dengue fever between January 2006 and December 2007. These patients were categorized into dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever according to the WHO severity grading scale. Results Out of a total of 15040 patients (63.2% male and 36.8% female), 3952 (26.3%) tested positive for dengue IgM antibody. 209 IgM proven dengue patients were hospitalized during the study period. During 2003, IgM positive cases were seen only during the months of July-December. In contrast, such cases were detected throughout the year from the 2004–2007. The median age of IgM positive patients decreased every year from 32.0 years in 2003 to 24.0 years in 2007 (p<0.001). Among hospitalized patients, nausea was the most common presenting feature found in 124/209 (59.3%) patients. Children presented with a higher median body temperature than adults (p = 0.010). In addition, neutropenia was seen more commonly in children while raised serum ALT levels were seen more commonly in adults (both p = 0.006). While a low total white cell count was more common in patients with dengue fever as compared to Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (p = 0.020), neutropenia (p = 0.019), monocytosis (p = 0.001) and raised serum ALT level (p = 0.005) were observed more commonly in the latter group. Conclusions Dengue virus is now endemic in Pakistan, circulating throughout the year with a peak incidence in the post monsoon period. Median age of dengue patients has decreased and younger patients may be more susceptible. Total and differential leukocyte counts may help identify patients at risk of hemorrhage."
https://openalex.org/W2010574285,"Microparticles (MPs) are vesicles released from plasma membrane upon cell activation and during apoptosis. Human T lymphocytes undergoing activation and apoptosis generate MPs bearing morphogen Shh (MPs(Shh+)) that are able to regulate in vitro angiogenesis.Here, we investigated the ability of MPs(Shh+) to modulate neovascularization in a model of mouse hind limb ischemia. Mice were treated in vivo for 21 days with vehicle, MPs(Shh+), MPs(Shh+) plus cyclopamine or cyclopamine alone, an inhibitor of Shh signalling. Laser doppler analysis revealed that the recovery of the blood flow was 1.4 fold higher in MPs(Shh+)-treated mice than in controls, and this was associated with an activation of Shh pathway in muscles and an increase in NO production in both aorta and muscles. MPs(Shh+)-mediated effects on flow recovery and NO production were completely prevented when Shh signalling was inhibited by cyclopamine. In aorta, MPs(Shh+) increased activation of eNOS/Akt pathway, and VEGF expression, being inhibited by cyclopamine. By contrast, in muscles, MPs(Shh+) enhanced eNOS expression and phosphorylation and decreased caveolin-1 expression, but cyclopamine prevented only the effects of MPs(Shh+) on eNOS pathway. Quantitative RT-PCR revealed that MPs(Shh+) treatment increased FGF5, FGF2, VEGF A and C mRNA levels and decreased those of α5-integrin, FLT-4, HGF, IGF-1, KDR, MCP-1, MT1-MMP, MMP-2, TGFβ1, TGFβ2, TSP-1 and VCAM-1, in ischemic muscles.These findings suggest that MPs(Shh+) may contribute to reparative neovascularization after ischemic injury by regulating NO pathway and genes involved in angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1992495736,"Organisms must utilize multiple mechanisms to maintain energetic homeostasis in the face of limited nutrient availability. One mechanism involves activation of the heterotrimeric AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a cell-autonomous sensor to energetic changes regulated by ATP to AMP ratios. We examined the phenotypic consequences of reduced AMPK function, both through RNAi knockdown of the gamma subunit (AMPKγ) and through expression of a dominant negative alpha (AMPKα) variant in Drosophila melanogaster. Reduced AMPK signaling leads to hypersensitivity to starvation conditions as measured by lifespan and locomotor activity. Locomotor levels in flies with reduced AMPK function were lower during unstressed conditions, but starvation-induced hyperactivity, an adaptive response to encourage foraging, was significantly higher than in wild type. Unexpectedly, total dietary intake was greater in animals with reduced AMPK function yet total triglyceride levels were lower. AMPK mutant animals displayed starvation-like lipid accumulation patterns in metabolically key liver-like cells, oenocytes, even under fed conditions, consistent with a persistent starved state. Measurements of O2 consumption reveal that metabolic rates are greater in animals with reduced AMPK function. Lastly, rapamycin treatment tempers the starvation sensitivity and lethality associated with reduced AMPK function. Collectively, these results are consistent with models that AMPK shifts energy usage away from expenditures into a conservation mode during nutrient-limited conditions at a cellular level. The highly conserved AMPK subunits throughout the Metazoa, suggest such findings may provide significant insight for pharmaceutical strategies to manipulate AMPK function in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2092991970,"CXCL10 (or Interferon-inducible protein of 10 kDa, IP-10) is an interferon-inducible chemokine with potent chemotactic activity on activated effector T cells and other leukocytes expressing its high affinity G protein-coupled receptor CXCR3. CXCL10 is also active on other cell types, including endothelial cells and fibroblasts. The mechanisms through which CXCL10 mediates its effects on non-leukocytes is not fully understood. In this study, we focus on the anti-proliferative effect of CXCL10 on endothelial cells, and demonstrate that CXCL10 can inhibit endothelial cell proliferation in vitro independently of CXCR3. Four main findings support this conclusion. First, primary mouse endothelial cells isolated from CXCR3-deficient mice were inhibited by CXCL10 as efficiently as wildtype endothelial cells. We also note that the proposed alternative splice form CXCR3-B, which is thought to mediate CXCL10's angiostatic activity, does not exist in mice based on published mouse CXCR3 genomic sequences as an in-frame stop codon would terminate the proposed CXCR3-B splice variant in mice. Second, we demonstrate that human umbilical vein endothelial cells and human lung microvascular endothelial cells that were inhibited by CXL10 did not express CXCR3 by FACS analysis. Third, two different neutralizing CXCR3 antibodies did not inhibit the anti-proliferative effect of CXCL10. Finally, fourth, utilizing a panel of CXCL10 mutants, we show that the ability to inhibit endothelial cell proliferation correlates with CXCL10's glycosaminoglycan binding affinity and not with its CXCR3 binding and signaling. Thus, using a very defined system, we show that CXCL10 can inhibit endothelial cell proliferation through a CXCR3-independent mechanism."

The K141E and K141N mutated forms of human HSPB8 that are associated with peripheral neuropathy were significantly less efficient than wild-type HSPB8 in decreasing the aggregation of both mutated ataxin 3 and P182L-HSPB1. Our current data further support the link between the HSPB8-BAG3 complex, autophagy, and folding diseases and demonstrate that impairment or loss of function of HSPB8 might accelerate the progression and/or severity of folding diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1971210299,"Glutathione (GSH) is an essential antioxidant responsible for the maintenance of intracellular redox homeostasis. As tumors outgrow their blood supply and become hypoxic, their redox homeostasis is challenged by the production of nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species (ROS). In gliomas, the sustained import of L-cystine via the L-cystine/L-glutamate exchanger, system x(c)(-), is rate-limiting for the synthesis of GSH. We show that hypoxia causes a significant increase in NO and ROS but without affecting glioma cell growth. This is explained by a concomitant increase in the utilization of GSH, which is accompanied by an increase in the cell-surface expression of xCT, the catalytic subunit of system x(c)(-), and L-cystine uptake. Growth was inhibited when GSH synthesis was blocked by buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), an inhibitor of the enzyme required for GSH synthesis, or when cells were deprived of L-cystine. These findings suggest that glioma cells show an increased requirement for GSH to maintain growth under hypoxic conditions. Therefore, approaches that limit GSH synthesis such as blocking system x(c)(-) may be considered as an adjuvant to radiation or chemotherapy."

Therefore, controlling the level of Axin is a critical step for the regulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. It has been shown that ubiquitination-mediated proteasomal degradation may play a critical role in the regulation of Axin; however, the E3 ubiquitin ligase(s), which attaches ubiquitin to a target protein in combination with an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, for Axin has not yet been identified.

Conversely, shRNA specific to Smurf2 blocked Axin ubiquitination. Essential domains of Axin responsible for Smurf2 interaction as well as Smurf2-mediated down-regulation and ubiquitination were identified. In vitro ubiquitination assays followed by analysis using mass spectroscopy revealed that Smurf2 specifically ubiquitinylated Lys505 of Axin and that the Axin(K505R) mutant resisted degradation.

Cancer. 2008; 8: 387-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar). Duplication of the embryonic axis in Axin−/Axin− mouse embryos and blocked embryonic axis formation by ectopic expression of Axin in Xenopus embryos suggest that Axin is a key regulator of embryonic axis formation via regulation of the Wnt pathway, which has been shown to play a major role in embryogenesis (2Zeng L. Fagotto F. Zhang T. Hsu W. Vasicek T.J. Perry 3rd, W.L. Lee J.J. Tilghman S.M. Gumbiner B.M. Costantini F. Cell. 1997; 90: 181-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). In this pathway, Axin forms a complex with proteins, including adenomatous polyposis coli protein, glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), 3The abbreviations used are: GSK3βglycogen synthase kinase 3βTcfT cell factorRIPAradioimmune precipitation assayEGFPenhanced GFP. β-catenin, protein phosphatase type 2A, and others, to control the level of β-catenin. In the absence of Wnt signaling, Axin facilitates phosphorylation of β-catenin by GSK3β, after which phosphorylated β-catenin is recognized by β-transducin repeat-containing protein, leading to ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Cellular stimulation with Wnt, such as Wnt3a, disintegrates the Axin complex and stabilizes β-catenin. The accumulated β-catenin then migrates into nuclei, where it interacts with T cell factor (Tcf)/lymphoid enhancer factor-1 and controls the expression of target genes involved in the regulation of diverse biological processes (3Polakis P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2007; 17: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). In addition to Wnt signaling, Axin has been shown to participate in a variety of other critical signaling cascades, including those for p53 (4Rui Y. Xu Z. Lin S. Li Q. Rui H. Luo W. Zhou H.M.

The level of Axin is very low compared with other Wnt signaling components in Xenopus cell extracts (8Lee E. Salic A. Krüger R. Heinrich R. Kirschner M.W. PLoS Biol. 2003; 1: E10Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was suggested that controlling the level of Axin is a critical step in the regulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling (9Tolwinski N.S. Wieschaus E. Trends Genet. 2004; 20: 177-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Loss of Axin leads to increased levels of β-catenin, as shown in many cancer cell lines (10Satoh S. Daigo Y. Furukawa Y. Kato T. Miwa N. Nishiwaki T. Kawasoe T. Ishiguro H. Fujita M. Tokino T. Sasaki Y. Imaoka S. Murata M. Shimano T. Yamaoka Y. Nakamura Y. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar), whereas too much Axin expression enhances the in vivo level of β-catenin (8Lee E. Salic A. Krüger R. Heinrich R. Kirschner M.W. PLoS Biol. 2003; 1: E10Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). This suggests that tight regulation of Axin expression is essential. Ubiquitination-mediated proteasomal degradation may play a critical role in the regulation of Axin (11Kim M.J. Chia I.V. Costantini F. FASEB J. 2008; 22: 3785-3794Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar); however, E3 ligase(s) for the degradation of Axin has not been identified. Ubiquitination occurs by sequential reactions including at least three types of enzymes. The C-terminal glycine of ubiquitin forms a thiol ester bond with an E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme in an ATP-dependent manner. This ubiquitin is then transferred to E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes. Finally, the transfer of E2-conjugated ubiquitin to the substrate is catalyzed by E3 ubiquitin ligase, which determines the substrate specificity. Two types of E3 ligases, the HECT (homologous to the E6-AP carboxyl terminus) domain and RING finger, have been identified. HECT domain E3 enzymes form a thiol ester intermediate with ubiquitin, followed by the transfer of ubiquitin to the substrate, whereas RING finger E3 enzymes catalyze the direct transfer of ubiquitin from E2 to the substrate (12Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2857) Google Scholar). Smurf2 (Smad ubiquitination regulatory factor 2) is a HECT domain E3 ligase involved in the ubiquitination of several proteins, including Smad proteins, which are involved in TGF-β signaling (13Zhang Y. Chang C. Gehling D.J. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Derynck R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 974-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Smurf2 can induce ubiquitination/proteasomal degradation of target proteins via interactions with other proteins. For example, Smurf2 induces the degradation of the TGF receptor or β-catenin by interacting with Smad7 (14Kavsak P. Rasmussen R.K. Causing C.G. Bonni S. Zhu H. Thomsen G.H. Wrana J.L. Mol.

Interestingly, Smurf2 interacts with Smad3 but does not induce the degradation of Smad3 (13Zhang Y. Chang C. Gehling D.J. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Derynck R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 974-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). These results prompted us to test whether or not Smurf2 acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for Axin, and we present data in strong support of such a possibility. The coding region of human Smurf2 was inserted into the pCS2-HA3 vector (constructed in our laboratory) and the pFLAG-CMV4 vector using a general PCR method. Smurf2(C716G) (ligase-dead mutant) and WW1 domain-deleted constructs were generated by PCR. For bacterial expression of GST-fused Smurf2 proteins, Smurf2 and Smurf2(C716G) coding sequences were subcloned into a pGEX4T-3 vector. Full-length cDNAs encoding human UbcH2, UbcH5A, UbcH5C, UbcH6, UbcH7, UbcH9, and UbcH10 were obtained by PCR and inserted into a pGEX vector (GE Healthcare). pCS2-HA-ubiquitin was generated by subcloning HA-ubiquitin cDNA into a pCS2-HA3 vector. pCS-FLAG-ubiquitin was provided by Dr. Ro (National Institutes of Health). HA-Nedd4 cDNA was a kind gift from Dr. McDonald (Victoria University, Wellington, New Zealand). Cloning of pCS2-Myc-Axin, pBI-Myc-Axin, and many deletion constructs of Axin was described previously (16Fagotto F. Jho E. Zeng L. Kurth T. Joos T. Kaufmann C. Costantini F. J.

For bacterial expression of His tag-fused Axin protein, Myc-Axin-(1–686) coding sequence was subcloned into a pET32b vector. shRNA targeting sequences against both human and mouse Smurf2 were designed using the web tools from Dharmacon and Promega. Sense (5′-GATCCCCGGAAGAATCCAGTATCTAATTCAAGAGATTAGATACTGGATTCTTCCTTTTTGGAAA-3′) and antisense (5′-AGCTTTTCCAAAAAGGAAGAATCCAGTATCTAATCTCTTGAATTAGATACTGGATTCTTCCGGG-3′) oligonucleotides were annealed and then ligated into the BglΙΙ and HindΙΙΙ sites of the pSUPER.retro.puro vector (Oligoengine). HEK293T, HEK293, HeLa, L929, Caco-2, SNU475, SNU449, and DLD1 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS (Invitrogen) and 1× antibiotic/antimycotic (Invitrogen) and maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. Transient transfection in HEK293T, HEK293, and Caco-2 cells was performed using the calcium phosphate method. For preparation of shRNA stable cell lines, HEK293T cells were transfected with pSUPER.retro.puro-shGFP or pSUPER.retro.puro-shSmurf2 using the calcium phosphate method. HeLa, DLD1, and SNU449 stable cell lines expressing GFP or Smurf2 shRNA were generated via retroviral infection. Retroviruses were produced in GP2-293 cell lines (Clontech) by transfection with pSUPER.retro.puro-shGFP or pSUPER.retro.puro-shSmurf2. The medium containing retroviruses was collected, filtered, concentrated, and mixed with 8 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma) before infection of cells. Stable cell populations were selected with 2 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma). Rabbit anti-Axin antibody was kindly provided by Dr. Virshup (University of Utah). Anti-HA (F-7), anti-α-tubulin (TU-02), anti-Smurf2 (H-50), and anti-ubiquitin (P4D1) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-β-catenin antibody was purchased from BD Bioscience. Anti-FLAG and anti-β-actin antibodies were purchased from Sigma. Anti-Myc antibody (9E10) was obtained from hybridoma cell lines (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa). Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaF, 2 mm EDTA, 100 μm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm PMSF, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μm pepstatin A). The lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected and used for immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. For immunoprecipitation, 200∼800 μg of cell lysate was incubated with an appropriate antibody in lysis buffer (RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1% SDS) was used for in vivo ubiquitination assay) for >2 h at 4 °C with rotation. 20 μl of protein A/G Plus-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added and continuously incubated for >1 h. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer or RIPA buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blotting. pGEX-Smurf2, pGEX-Smurf2(C716G), and pGEX-UbcH were transformed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). For the induction of GST fusion proteins, 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Calbiochem) was added in yeast extract/Tryptone medium. Purification of GST fusion proteins was performed according to standard procedures (GE Healthcare). To remove GST, GST fusion proteins were incubated overnight with biotinylated thrombin (Novagen) at 4 °C. The biotinylated thrombin was then removed by streptavidin-agarose (Novagen). S·His-tagged Axin proteins were expressed in E. coli and purified according to standard methods (Novagen). The reaction was carried out for 2 h at 37 °C in 25 μl of reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, and 50 μm dithiothreitol supplemented with 5 mm ATP) containing 10 μg of ubiquitin (Boston Biochem), 200 ng of E1 (Boston Biochem), and purified UbcH5C, Smurf2, and S·His-Axin-(1–686) proteins. The reaction samples were incubated with 30 μl of S-protein-agarose (Novagen) in RIPA buffer and washed three times with RIPA buffer. The pulled down samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and polyubiquitinated Axin was detected by Western blotting with anti-ubiquitin antibody P4D1. [35S]Met-labeled Myc-Axin-(1–832), that was translated in vitro using the TnT system (Promega), was incubated with ubiquitin, E1, UbcH5A, and Smurf2 in reaction buffer. The samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography. The regions for analysis were excised from SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The proteins were reduced, alkylated, and then digested overnight with a sequencing grade modified trypsin (12.5 ng/μl; Promega) at 37 °C, followed by endoproteinase Glu-C (Roche Applied Science) digestion. The digested peptides were extracted three times with 5% formic acid in 50% acetonitrile solution at room temperature for 20 min and desalted using ZipTipC18 (Millipore) before MS analysis. The proteolytic peptides were loaded onto a fused silica microcapillary column (12 cm × 75 μm) packed with the C18 reversed-phase resin (5 μm, 200 Å). LC separation was conducted under a linear gradient as follows: a 3–40% solvent B (0.1% formic acid in 100% acetonitrile) gradient at a flow rate of 250 nl/min for 60 min. The column was directly connected to an LTQ linear ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Finnigan) equipped with a nanoelectrospray ion source. The electrospray voltage was set at 1.95 kV, and the threshold for switching from MS to MS/MS was 500. The normalized collision energy for MS/MS was 35% of the main radio frequency amplitude, and the duration of activation was 30 ms. All spectra were acquired in data-dependent scan mode. Each full MS scan was followed by five MS/MS scans corresponding to the most intense to the fifth intense peaks of the full MS scan. The repeat count of the peak for dynamic exclusion was 1, and its repeat duration was 30 s. The dynamic exclusion duration was set for 180 s, and the width of the exclusion mass was ±1.5 Da. The list size of dynamic exclusion was 50. The collected MS/MS spectra were searched using the SEQUEST program (Thermo Finnigan) with the selected criteria of oxidation at Met (+16 Da), carboxyamidomethylation at Cys (+57 Da), and ubiquitination at Lys (+114 Da) as variable modifications. Cells were cotransfected with SuperTOPFlash (kindly provided by Dr. Moon, University of Washington), pRL-TK (Promega), and the plasmids indicated in the figures. The Dual-Luciferase assay was performed according to standard procedures using a GloMAX 20/20 luminometer (Promega). Axin is polyubiquitinated at steady state, but its level is further decreased in the presence of Wnt signaling via proteasomal degradation (11Kim M.J. Chia I.V. Costantini F. FASEB J. 2008; 22: 3785-3794Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 18Willert K. Shibamoto S. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1768-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). To examine whether or not Smurf2 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase for Axin, we tested the interaction between Axin and Smurf2. HEK293T cells were transfected with Myc-tagged Axin and HA-tagged Smurf2(C716G), which is a ligase-dead mutant of Smurf2 in which the cysteine responsible for the conjugation of ubiquitin is changed to glycine (13Zhang Y. Chang C. Gehling D.J. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Derynck R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 974-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Because we found that ectopic expression of Smurf2, but not Smurf2(C716G) (indicated as CG in the figures), caused down-regulation of Axin (see Fig. 2A), Smurf2(C716G) was used to examine the interaction of Axin with Smurf2. Immunoprecipitation analysis showed that both exogenously expressed and endogenous Axin interacted with Smurf2 (Fig. 1, A and B). To determine which Axin domain is necessary for the interaction, deletion constructs of Axin and HA-tagged Smurf2(C716G) were transfected into HEK293T cells, and co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed (Fig. 1, C and D). Deletion of several single domains resulted in reduced interaction between Axin and Smurf2. However, none of them completely blocked the interaction (for example, AxinΔ209–407 and AxinΔ508–711, etc.) (Fig. 1D). These results suggest that multiple domains containing amino acids 228–354, 508–711, and 745–826 of Axin are responsible for the interaction with Smurf2.FIGURE 1Axin interacts with Smurf2. A, HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids for Myc-tagged Axin and HA-tagged Smurf2(C716G) (inactive mutant of Smurf2) either alone or together. Cell lysates were then subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP), followed by immunoblotting (IB) with the antibodies indicated. Whole cell lysates (WCL) were immunoblotted with anti-HA antibody. B, HEK293T cells were transfected with a plasmid for FLAG-Smurf2(C716G), and the cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with rabbit anti-Axin antibody or rabbit serum, followed by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG and anti-Axin antibodies.

FL, full-length.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The ectopic expression of Smurf2, but not the Smurf2(C716G) mutant, reduced the level of cotransfected Axin (Fig. 2A). However, the level of EGFP, which was cotransfected as a control for the equal transfection of all constructs, remained unchanged. These results suggest that Smurf2 specifically down-regulated the level of Axin (Fig. 2A). We then tested whether or not the ectopic expression of Smurf2 could enhance polyubiquitination of Axin. Cotransfection of Smurf2, but not Smurf2(C716G), enhanced Axin ubiquitination (Fig. 2B, left panel). To exclude the possibility that the polyubiquitination signal from the above experiment originated from Axin-associated proteins, double immunoprecipitation experiments were performed as shown in Fig. 2B. The polyubiquitination signal was detected only in the sample containing Axin and Smurf2 (Fig. 2B, right panel), which strongly suggests that Smurf2 ubiquitinylates Axin. Nedd4 is a HECT-type E3 ligase with very similar domains to Smurf2 (19Chen C. Matesic L.E. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2007; 26: 587-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). However, cotransfection of Nedd4 did not enhance polyubiquitination of Axin (Fig. 2C), suggesting that Smurf2 specifically ubiquitinylates Axin. The Axin construct deleted of amino acids 228–354 and 508–711 did not interact with Smurf2 (Fig. 1D). Thus, we tested whether or not the interaction between Axin and Smurf2 is necessary for the degradation and polyubiquitination of Axin. When AxinΔ228–354 and AxinΔ508–711 was transfected with Smurf2, down-regulation and polyubiquitination of Axin were severely blocked (Fig. 2, D and E). These findings indicate that the interaction between Axin and Smurf2 is necessary for the Smurf2-mediated ubiquitination and down-regulation of Axin. To determine whether Smurf2 directly ubiquitinylates Axin, in vitro ubiquitination assays were performed. UbcH5A and UbcH5C were used in subsequent experiments because the in vitro ubiquitination assay using various E2 enzymes showed that UbcH5A, UbcH5C, and UbcH7 were all capable of auto-ubiquitination of Smurf2 (supplemental Fig. 1) (20Ogunjimi A.A. Briant D.J. Pece-Barbara N. Le Roy C. Di Guglielmo G.M. Kavsak P. Rasmussen R.K. Seet B.T. Sicheri F. Wrana J.L. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 297-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Because bacterially produced E2 enzymes and Smurf2 did not exhibit full activity upon fusing with GST, thrombin was used to remove the GST tag. However, an in vitro ubiquitination assay using these proteins caused nonspecific degradation of Axin. To overcome this problem, biotinylated thrombin was used, and additional purification with streptavidin was performed, which prevented the nonspecific degradation of Axin that occurred during the in vitro ubiquitination assays. Therefore, it seems that Axin is a very labile protein and that residual thrombin might cause nonspecific degradation of Axin. Using the purified components shown in Fig. 3A, an in vitro ubiquitination assay was performed. The incubation of Smurf2, but not the Smurf2(C716G) mutant, with ubiquitin, E1, and UbcH5C caused ubiquitination of Axin (Fig. 3A, lanes 7 and 8). The reaction without Axin also showed a weak ubiquitination signal (Fig. 3A, lane 2). This signal seems to have been due to the auto-ubiquitination of Smurf2, which was nonspecifically pulled down by S-protein-agarose (supplemental Fig. 2). Because Axin interacted with Smurf2 (Fig. 1), we suspected that the stronger ubiquitination signal shown in Fig. 3A (lane 7) resulted from the auto-ubiquitination of Smurf2 because Smurf2 could be pulled down more in the presence of S·His-Axin. To circumvent this, an in vitro ubiquitination assay using Axin translated in vitro with [35S]methionine was performed (Fig. 3B). Mixtures of rabbit reticulocyte lysates containing [35S]methionine-labeled Axin were incubated with the purified proteins indicated in Fig. 3B. The reaction mixtures were separated by SDS-PAGE, and polyubiquitination of Axin was detected by autoradiography (Fig. 3B). The incubation of Smurf2, but not the Smurf2(C716G) mutant, with ubiquitin, E1, and UbcH5A produced polyubiquitination signals (Fig. 3B, lanes 6 and 7). Polyubiquitination of Axin was also detected in the reaction mixture incubated without E1 (Fig. 3B, lane 3). Because the E1 enzyme does not have any target specificity (21Haas A.L. Bright P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13258-13267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), endogenous E1 enzyme from rabbit reticulocyte lysates might be used in the reaction. Axin was mono-ubiquitinylated in vitro by Smurf2 using a mutant form of ubiquitin, and the putative ubiquitinylated Axin band was excised, followed by mass spectrometric analysis to determine the ubiquitination site(s) of Axin (Fig. 3C). Trypsin digestion of unubiquitinated Axin produced a peptide with a Lys505 terminal residue (Fig. 3D), whereas the putative ubiquitinylated Axin bands indicated a peptide that terminated with the next lysine due to mono-ubiquitination of Lys505 (Fig. 3E). In addition, the longer peptide produced peaks that were 114 Da larger in mass than the expected peaks in the LC-MS/MS analysis, which was due to the branching of two additional glycine residues leftover from ubiquitin after trypsin digestion (Fig. 3, D and E). This result confirms that Smurf2 ubiquitinylates Axin in vitro and suggests that Lys505 is a potential in vivo ubiquitination site of Smurf2. Axin(K505R) resisted degradation upon cotransfection with Smurf2 (Fig. 3F). In addition, knockdown of Smurf2 enhanced the level of wild-type Axin, but not Axin(K505R) (supplemental Fig. 3). Furthermore, the level of Axin(K505R) was maintained at a higher level compared with wild-type Axin in cell lines expressing GFP shRNA (supplemental Fig. 3, lanes 1 and 3). These results indicate that Lys505 is the ubiquitination site responsible for Axin degradation by Smurf2 in vivo. Overall, the data from LC-MS/MS analysis and the results with Axin(K505R) strongly suggest that Smurf2 specifically ubiquitinylates Axin at Lys505 both in vitro and in vivo. Consistent with the enhanced ubiquitination and down-regulation of Axin by the ectopic expression of Smurf2, knockdown of endogenous Smurf2 increased the level of endogenous Axin (Fig. 4, A and B). Knockdown of Smurf2 by shRNA also reduced the ubiquitination of Axin, which was rescued by the ectopic expression of Smurf2ΔWW1 (Fig. 4, A and C). Smurf2ΔWW1, a mutant form of Smurf2 lacking the shRNA targeting sequence (Fig. 4A), interacted and ubiquitinylated Axin similar to wild-type Smurf2 (data not shown). As Axin negatively regulates Wnt/β-catenin signaling, we tested whether or not knockdown of Smurf2 could inhibit β-catenin/Tcf-mediated reporter activity by increasing Axin expression. The reporter activity was reduced by the expression of Smurf2 shRNA, but this reduction was rescued by the coexpression of Axin shRNA (Fig. 4D). Knockdown of Smurf2 in HeLa and Caco-2 cells, but not in SNU475 cells that do not express Axin due to mutation (10Satoh S. Daigo Y. Furukawa Y. Kato T. Miwa N. Nishiwaki T. Kawasoe T. Ishiguro H. Fujita M. Tokino T. Sasaki Y. Imaoka S. Murata M. Shimano T. Yamaoka Y. Nakamura Y. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar), resulted in reduced reporter activity (Fig. 4E). These results suggest that the inhibition of β-catenin/Tcf reporter activity by Smurf2 shRNA is mediated by the regulation of Axin. In addition, we found that HeLa and DLD1 cells expressing Smurf2 shRNA showed slower growth rates than GFP shRNA-expressing control cells (supplemental Fig. 4). Because Smurf2 is involved in the regulation of various signaling pathways, the reduced growth rate of Smurf2 knockdown cells may not be due only to the inhibition of β-catenin/Tcf signaling. However, it is interesting that SNU449 cells, which have a mutation of β-catenin and in which the level of β-catenin is not regulated by Axin (10Satoh S. Daigo Y. Furukawa Y. Kato T. Miwa N. Nishiwaki T. Kawasoe T. Ishiguro H. Fujita M. Tokino T. Sasaki Y. Imaoka S. Murata M. Shimano T. Yamaoka Y. Nakamura Y. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar), did not show slower growth when Smurf2 was knocked down (supplemental Fig. 4). In summary, the results of the knockdown of endogenous Smurf2 support the idea that Smurf2 is an E3 ligase for the ubiquitination and down-regulation of Axin. Controlling the level of Axin is a critical step in Wnt signaling. As such, Axin is considered as a potential therapeutic target; therefore, identification of small molecules that control Axin expression has received increasing attention (22Chen B. Dodge M.E. Tang W. Lu J. Ma Z. Fan C.W. Wei S. Hao W. Kilgore J. Williams N.S. Roth M.G. Amatruda J.F. Chen C. Lum L. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2009; 5: 100-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar, 23Huang S.M.

Nature. 2009; 461: 614-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (1492) Google Scholar). The ubiquitin/proteasomal pathway is involved in Axin regulation; however, the E3 ligase responsible for this process has not been identified due to the extremely low expression and instability of Axin. It was found previously that Smurf2 enhances the ubiquitination of Prickle via interaction with Dvl, β-catenin, and GSK3β (15Han G. Li A.G. Liang Y.Y. Owens P. He W. Lu S. Yoshimatsu Y. Wang D.

O'Keefe R.J. Chen D. Rosier R.N. Exp. Cell Res. 2009; 315: 2386-2398Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, our in vitro ubiquitination analysis suggests that GSK3β is not a direct substrate of Smurf2; rather, it may require extra modification before ubiquitination by Smurf2 (supplemental Fig. 5). In a study by Wu et al. (25Wu Q. Huang J.H. Sampson E.R. Kim K.O. Zuscik M.J. O'Keefe R.J. Chen D. Rosier R.N. Exp. Cell Res. 2009; 315: 2386-2398Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), this result was not examined by in vitro ubiquitination analysis. In addition, it seems unusual that Smurf2 would act as an E3 ligase for both Axin and β-catenin if we consider that Axin negatively regulates the level of β-catenin. Interestingly, Han et al. (15Han G. Li A.G. Liang Y.Y. Owens P. He W. Lu S. Yoshimatsu Y. Wang D. Ten Dijke P. Lin X. Wang X.J. Dev. Cell. 2006; 11: 301-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) showed that Smad7 is necessary for the Smurf2-mediated ubiquitination of β-catenin. In their study, they could not detect β-transducin repeat-containing protein, a previously identified E3 ligase involved in Axin/GSK3β-mediated β-catenin degradation, in Smad7/Smurf2 immunoprecipitates. These results suggest that Smurf2 may ubiquitinylate different substrates in a context-dependent manner. We found that knockdown of endogenous Smurf2 increased the Axin level and reduced β-catenin/Tcf reporter activity (Fig. 4, B–E), which suggests that Smurf2 works mainly as an E3 ligase for Axin in HEK293T, HeLa, and Caco-2 cells. MS/MS spectrometric analysis suggested that Smurf2 ubiquitinylates Lys505 of Axin in vitro. However, it is still possible that Smurf2 ubiquitinylates other sites besides Lys505, as two shifted bands were detected in the Coomassie Blue-stained gel (Fig. 3C). However, based on the result that Axin(K505R) was resistant to degradation by cotransfection with Smurf2 (Fig. 3F), it seems that Lys505 is a critical site for the degradation of Axin by Smurf2. Knockdown of Smurf2 reduced the growth of HeLa and DLD1 cells, but not SNU449 cells (supplemental Fig. 4). Smurf2 controls the levels of proteins such as the TGF-β receptor (14Kavsak P. Rasmussen R.K. Causing C.G. Bonni S. Zhu H. Thomsen G.H. Wrana J.L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1365-1375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar), Smad1 (13Zhang Y. Chang C.

Stroschein S.L. Luo K. Wrana J.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 587-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Thus, the reasons for the reduced growth rate upon knockdown of Smurf2 are uncertain. However, the following evidence supports the idea that the reduced growth is due, at least partially, to the inhibition of β-catenin/Tcf signaling via increasing Axin expression. (i) Ectopic expression of Axin and stabilization of Axin upon treatment with XAV959 cause reduced cell growth (23Huang S.M. Mishina Y.M. Liu S. Cheung A. Stegmeier F. Michaud G.A. Charlat O.

(ii) SNU449 cells, in which the level of β-catenin is not regulated by Axin due to mutation of β-catenin (10Satoh S. Daigo Y. Furukawa Y. Kato T. Miwa N. Nishiwaki T. Kawasoe T. Ishiguro H. Fujita M.

(iii) Knockdown of Smurf2 in HEK293T and HEK293 cells did not cause any changes in the reporter assays that measure TGF-β signaling activity (supplemental Fig. 6). Overall, our data strongly suggest that Smurf2 is an E3 ligase for Axin. Further investigation of the regulation of Smurf2 activity for Axin degradation will provide new ways of modulating Wnt/β-catenin signaling, thus leading to treatment of diseases related to that signaling.

The gradient ranged from extreme high temperatures, high sulfide concentrations, and low pH at sulfide chimneys to ambient deep-sea water conditions on bare basalt. We explore meiofauna diversity and abundance, and discuss its possible underlying ecological and evolutionary processes.After sampling in five physico-chemically different habitats, the meiofauna was sorted, counted and classified. Abundances were low at all sites. A total of 52 species were identified at vent habitats. The vent community was dominated by hard substrate generalists that also lived on bare basalt at ambient deep-sea temperature in the axial summit trough (AST generalists). Some vent species were restricted to a specific vent habitat (vent specialists), but others occurred over a wide range of physico-chemical conditions (vent generalists). Additionally, 35 species were only found on cold bare basalt (basalt specialists). At vent sites, species richness and diversity clearly increased with decreasing influence of vent fluid emissions from extreme flow sulfide chimney (no fauna), high flow pompei worm (S: 4-7, H'(loge): 0.11-0.45), vigorous flow tubeworm (S: 8-23; H'(loge): 0.44-2.00) to low flow mussel habitats (S: 28-31; H'(loge): 2.34-2.60).Our data suggest that with increasing temperature and toxic hydrogen sulfide concentrations and increasing amplitude of variation of these factors, fewer species are able to cope with these extreme conditions. This results in less diverse communities in more extreme habitats. The finding of many species being present at sites with and without vent fluid emissions points to a non endemic deep-sea hydrothermal vent meiofaunal community. This is in contrast to a mostly endemic macrofauna but similar to what is known for meiofauna from shallow-water vents."
https://openalex.org/W1964351757,"TLR3 (Toll-like receptor 3) recognizes dsRNA, a potent indicator of viral infection. The extracellular domain of TLR3 dimerizes when it binds dsRNA, and the crystal structure of the dimeric complex reveals three sites of interaction on each extracellular domain, two that bind dsRNA and one that is responsible for dimer formation. The goal of this study was to determine which amino acid residues are essential for forming a stable receptor·ligand complex and whether dimerization of TLR3 is required for dsRNA binding. Using a novel ELISA to analyze dsRNA binding by mutant TLR3 constructs, we identified the essential interacting residues and determined that the simultaneous interaction of all three sites is required for ligand binding. In addition, we show that TLR3 is unable to bind dsRNA when dimerization is prevented by mutating residues in the dimerization site or by immobilizing TLR3 at low density. We conclude that dimerization of TLR3 is essential for ligand binding and that the three TLR3 contact sites individually interact weakly with their binding partners but together form a high affinity receptor·ligand complex."
https://openalex.org/W1984395609,"Background The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, is a well-established model organism for probing the molecular and cellular basis of physiological and immune system responses of adults or late stage larvae to bacterial challenge. However, very little is known about the consequences of bacterial infections that occur in earlier stages of development. We have infected mid-second instar larvae with strains of Pseudomonas fluorescens to determine how infection alters the ability of larvae to survive and complete development. Methodology/Principal Findings We mimicked natural routes of infection using a non-invasive feeding procedure to study the toxicity of the three sequenced P. fluorescens strains (Pf0-1, SBW25, and Pf-5) to Drosophila melanogaster. Larvae fed with the three strains of P. fluorescens showed distinct differences in developmental trajectory and survival. Treatment with SBW25 caused a subset of insects to die concomitant with a systemic melanization reaction at larval, pupal or adult stages. Larvae fed with Pf-5 died in a dose-dependent manner with adult survivors showing eye and wing morphological defects. In addition, larvae in the Pf-5 treatment groups showed a dose-dependent delay in the onset of metamorphosis relative to control-, Pf0-1-, and SBW25-treated larvae. A functional gacA gene is required for the toxic properties of wild-type Pf-5 bacteria. Conclusions/Significance These experiments are the first to demonstrate that ingestion of P. fluorescens bacteria by D. melanogaster larvae causes both lethal and non-lethal phenotypes, including delay in the onset of metamorphosis and morphological defects in surviving adult flies, which can be decoupled."

https://openalex.org/W2088808704,"Hedgehog (Hh) signaling, via the key signal transducer Smoothened (SMO) and Gli transcription factors, is essential for embryonic development and carcinogenesis. At present, the molecular mechanism of Hh signaling-mediated carcinogenesis is not completely understood. Using a mouse model (K14cre/R26SmoM2) of SMO-mediated basal cell carcinoma development, we identified TGFβ2 as a major Hh-regulated gene. TGFβ2 expression was high in the keratinocytes, with activated TGFβ signaling (indicated by elevated expression of phosphorylated SMAD2/3) detected in both tumor and stroma. The significance of TGFβ signaling for SMO function was demonstrated in two assays. Down-regulation of TGFβ2 expression prevented Hh signaling-dependent osteoblast differentiation and motor neuron differentiation. Furthermore, inhibition of TGFβ signaling by TGFβ receptor I inhibitor SD208 significantly reduced tumor area in K14cre/R26SmoM2 mice. Tumor shrinkage in mice was associated with an increased number of lymphocytes, suggesting an immune suppression role of TGFβ signaling.

Binding of Hh to its receptor PTC releases this inhibition, allowing SMO to signal downstream, leading to formation of active forms of Gli transcription factors. As transcription factors, Gli molecules can regulate target gene expression by direct association with a specific consensus sequence located at the promoter region of the target genes (5Kinzler K.W.

In addition to the canonical pathways (ligand overexpression, altered expression of Hh signaling molecules, or gene mutations), recent studies indicate that Hh signaling can also be activated by other signaling pathways, such as K-Ras. Both canonical and non-canonical Hh signaling activation are found in many types of human cancer, including brain tumors, gastrointestinal, prostate, lung, and breast cancers (6Xie J. Acta Biochim.

To understand the molecular basis by which Hh signaling regulates carcinogenesis, we analyzed gene expression of a mouse model of basal cell carcinoma in which an activated form of SMO (SmoM2) replaces the wild type SMO allele and is expressed under the control of the keratin 14 promoter. Our results indicated that several signaling pathways associated with carcinogenesis are altered in this mouse model. In particular, TGFβ2 was significantly induced by SmoM2 expression. Elevated expression of phosphorylated SMAD2 and SMAD3, markers for TGFβ signaling activation, was seen in SmoM2-mediated tumors and in the stroma. TGFβ signaling is a known pathway important for tumor development. Depending on the stage of tumor development and cellular context, TGFβ signaling can function as tumor suppressor, tumor promoter, or modulator for immune surveillance and inflammation (10Owens P.

The final concentration of all the chemicals was 5 μm for in vivo study. Chemicals were applied topically on the skin surface in the upper and lower areas of abdomen, respectively. 70% ethanol was embrocated in the middle belly as a control. Topical application of chemicals was performed daily for 4 weeks. At the end of the study, skin biopsies were collected for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and gene expression analysis as described previously (16Athar M. Li C. Tang X. Chi S. Zhang X. Kim A.L.

Skin tissues were collected after each experiment. Half of the tissue was frozen on dry ice and immediately stored at −80 °C. The other half was fixed in formalin overnight, paraffin-embedded, sectioned at 5 μm, and stained with H&E. Eight epidermal areas were randomly chosen in each section (16Athar M. Li C. Tang X. Chi S.

The viable tumor areas in selected tissue areas were quantified by manually demarcating the tumor boundary on an electronic image of an H&E-stained section. The proportion of tumor area to the total tissue area was quantified using MetaMorph imaging software (version 6.2r6, Downingtown, PA) or ImageJ.

Probe level data analysis was performed on Affymetrix files using the robust multichip analysis method. Further, the probe sets absent across all the chips were filtered out before the differential expression testing. Differential expression testing was performed using Student's t test comparing epidermal gene expression between K14cre+/SmoM2+ and K14cre+/SmoM2− mice. The genes were filtered as significant from Student's t test at p value < = 0.05. In addition, the local pool error (LPE) (18Jain N. Thatte J. Braciale T. Ley K. O'Connell M. Lee J.K.

The LPE estimation pools error within genes and between arrays for genes with similar expression intensities, thus reducing the increased type I and II errors due to the low replicates. The hierarchical clustering on the significant genes from the Student's t test and LPE test with heat map was done using Spotfire (TIBCO Software Inc.). Further, IPA 8.6 (Ingenuity Systems, Redwood City, CA) was used for functional and network analysis to identify the pathways, biological functions that are involved due to the differential expression between the K14cre+/SmoM2+ and K14cre+/SmoM2− mice (17He J.

Total RNA was isolated from the tissues using TRIzol reagent (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. One μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNAs using the first-strand synthesis kit (Roche Applied Science). We performed RT-PCR of Hedgehog target genes with 32 cycles of 96 °C for 30 s, 57 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 45 s with the following primers: Hip, forward, 5′-CCTGTCGAGGCTACTTTTCG-3′, and reverse, 5′-GGGCAGGTTGAACTGTGACT-3′; Ptch1, forward, 5′-CTCAGGCAATACGAAGCACA-3′, and reverse, 5′-GACAAGGAGCCAGAGTCCAG-3′; Gli1, forward, 5′-GGTCCACCAACCAACTATGG-3′, and reverse, 5′-TGGCAGGGCTCTGACTAACT-3′. β-Actin was used as an internal control. PCR products were separated on a 1.5% agarose gel and visualized after ethidium bromide staining. Real-time PCR was performed as previously described (17He J. Sheng T. Stelter A.A. Li C. Zhang X. Sinha M. Luxon B.A. Xie J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35598-35602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). C3H10T1/2 cells, purchased from ATCC, were cultured according to ATCC instruction. Mouse embryonic stem (ES) cell line E14Tg2a derived from 129/O1a mice was purchased from the Mutant Mouse Regional Resource Centers (MMRRC) and cultured according to a procedure from the vendor (MMRRC Thawing and Culture Protocol for E14TG2a.4 feeder-independent ES cell clones). To obtain keratinocytes from mice, epidermis was first separated from the dermis as described earlier, digested in trypsin solution for 30 min at 37 °C, and passed through a cell strainer (BD Biosciences). Keratinocytes were cultured in keratinocyte-serum free medium (Invitrogen). Lentivirus-mediated shRNA expression was used to silence gene expression of TGFβ2 or SMO according to a previously reported procedure (19Moffat J. Grueneberg D.A. Yang X. Kim S.Y. Kloepfer A.M. Hinkle G. Piqani B. Eisenhaure T.M. Luo B. Grenier J.K. Carpenter A.E. Foo S.Y. Stewart S.A. Stockwell B.R. Hacohen N. Hahn W.C. Lander E.S. Sabatini D.M. Root D.E. Cell. 2006; 124: 1283-1298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1370) Google Scholar). All shRNAs were purchased from Sigma. In brief, five clones of shRNAs specific for each target gene were used to generate lentiviruses. An shRNA clone to luciferase was used as a negative control. Viruses were purified by ultracentrifuge and used to infect either C3H10T1/2 or E14Tg2a cells. GFP-expressing lentiviruses were used to detect virus infection efficiency. Infected cells were selected with puromycin at 500–1000 μg/ml for 5 days. Gene silencing efficiency was assessed by RT-PCR of the target genes. In our experiments, three shRNA clones each for SMO and TGFβ2 were shown to effectively down-regulate target gene expression by 70%. Confluent C3H10T1/2 cells were treated with SMO agonist purmorphamine at 2.5 μm for 7 days. Expression of osteoblast cell marker alkaline phosphatase was achieved by incubating cells with alkaline phosphatase substrate, Fast Red TR/Naphthol AS-MX (Sigma), at 1 mg/ml for 30 min at 37 °C with continual agitation. The alkaline phosphatase activity was also measured by spectrophotometry using the Sensolyte p-nitrophenyl phosphate alkaline phosphatase assay kit (AnaSpec, San Jose, CA) following the vendor's instructions. The activity from each sample was determined and normalized to total protein content derived from the BCA protein assay (Pierce). The increase in absorbance at 570 nm was monitored every 5 min over 80 min, and the ALPase activity (nmol of p-nitrophenol produced/min) was calculated from a linear range. The specific activity of ALPase was given as nmol of p-nitrophenol/min/mg of protein. Motor neuron differentiation was performed according to Wichterle et al. (20Wichterle H. Lieberam I. Porter J.A. Jessell T.M. Cell. 2002; 110: 385-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1418) Google Scholar). In short, embryonic bodies were formed from ES cells in ES cell medium without leukemia inhibitory factor in an ultra-low adhesive plate with 5 × 105 cells/ml for 2 days. Motor neurons were induced by the addition of retinoid acids (100 nm) and purmorphamine (2.5 μm) for 5–7 days (20Wichterle H. Lieberam I. Porter J.A. Jessell T.M. Cell. 2002; 110: 385-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1418) Google Scholar, 21Mao J. Barrow J. McMahon J. Vaughan J. McMahon A.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: e155Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Statistical analyses were performed using the Student's t test to compare the results, with p values of <0.05 indicating statistically significant differences. R26-SmoM2YFP mice (13Mao J. Ligon K.L. Rakhlin E.Y. Thayer S.P. Bronson R.T. Rowitch D. McMahon A.P. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 10171-10178Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) were crossed with K14cre mice (12Jonkers J. Meuwissen R. van der Gulden H. Peterse H. van der Valk M. Berns A. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 418-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar) to generate mice expressing SmoM2YFP under the control of the keratin 14 promoter. Shortly after birth, the K14cre/R26SmoM2YFP mice exhibited hyperproliferation of basal cells in the epidermis on day 3, which became more severe on day 15 (Fig. 1A). The earliest visual phenotype in this model is the appearance of wrinkled ears due to tumor formation. These mice started to lose fur from week 3. By week 8, no fur was visible (Fig. 1A). Histology analysis revealed that BCC-like tumors appear in ear, penis, and skin all over the body. Most K14cre/R26-SmoM2YFP mice had reduced body weight (by 20–40%) in comparison with the wild type littermates. After dissection of the mice, no obvious tumor formation was seen in other organs examined. These phenotypes appeared in mice with B6, 129, CD1, or mixed genetic background, suggesting that genetic background does not affect the phenotype. These results indicate that keratin 14 promoter-driven expression of activated SMO, SmoM2, is sufficient to cause tumor formation in the skin. To examine the molecular basis of Hedgehog signaling-mediated carcinogenesis in this mouse model, we isolated epidermis from different genotypes and performed GeneChip analysis. We found that many known Hedgehog target genes were up-regulated in K14cre/R26SmoM2YFP epidermis (in comparison with K14cre negative R26SmoM2YFP epidermis), such as krt 17, human homologue of hedgehog-interacting protein (Hip), and Ptch1 (supplemental Table S1 and Fig. 1C). In addition, we identified changes in a number of pathways involved in tumor microenvironment such as TGFβ, PDGF, IGF-1, and endothelin-1 from the LPE test (supplemental Fig. S1). As shown in Fig. 1B, TGFβ2 was one of the major genes highly expressed in SmoM2YFP-expressing epidermis. We further isolated keratinocytes from mouse litters with or without SmoM2 expression and detected gene expression of TGFβ2 and other known Hh target genes. As shown in Fig. 1C, SmoM2-expressing keratinocytes expressed a high level of TGFβ2 (over 5×) than those without SmoM2 expression. Consistent with this finding, we detected elevated levels of phosphorylated SMAD2 and SMAD3, markers for TGFβ signaling activation, in SmoM2YFP-mediated tumors and stroma (supplemental Fig. S2). The relevance of this finding to human cancer was our finding that human BCCs exhibit high levels of phosphorylated SMAD2 and SMAD3 in tumors as well as tumor-associated stroma (supplemental Fig. S3). Immunohistochemistry of SMAD molecules in both human BCCs and mouse tumors suggests that Hh signaling-induced TGFβ signaling activation occurs both in the tumor and in the stroma. Based on our data, we suggest that keratinocytes with activated Hh signaling (BCC cells) produce TGFβ2, which in turn acts via autocrine and paracrine signaling to activate the TGFβ pathway. We predict that TGFβ signaling mediates some functions of Hh signaling during development of BCCs. To demonstrate the role of TGFβ2 for Hh signaling, we tested the effects of TGFβ2 depletion on Hh signaling-mediated motor neuron differentiation and osteoblast differentiation. The reason for choosing these two systems is the fact that we observed induced TGFβ signaling (as shown by elevated SMAD2 phosphorylation) (22Chen Y.G. Wang X.F. Cell Res. 2009; 19: 1-2Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) in the presence of SMO agonist purmorphamine (Fig. 2, A and B). Following Sonic Hh stimulation or the addition of purmorphamine, C3H101/2 cells can differentiate into osteoblast cell as distinguished by elevated expression of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (Fig. 2C). Because we noticed that cells stimulated with Shh or purmorphamine had high levels of Hh target gene expression as well as a high level of phosphorylated SMAD2, we tested the effect of TGFβ2 down-regulation on Hh signaling-mediated osteoblast differentiation and found that knocking down the expression of TGFβ2 reduced the level of ALP. As shown in Fig. 2C and supplemental Fig. S4, cells with down-regulation of TGFβ2 had weak or non-detectable ALP activity, whereas the control cells (a non-functional shRNA or the parental cells) had a high level of ALP activity. This result indicates that Hh signaling-mediated osteoblast differentiation requires TGFβ2 signaling. To substantiate our data in C3H10T1/2 cells, we examined the effects of TGFβ2 knockdown on Hh signaling-mediated motor neuron differentiation, a system known to be Hedgehog signaling-dependent (20Wichterle H. Lieberam I. Porter J.A. Jessell T.M. Cell. 2002; 110: 385-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1418) Google Scholar). We showed that differentiation of motor neurons is associated with elevated levels of phosphorylated SMAD2 and SMAD3 (Fig. 2B). Using similar approaches to the one in C3H10T1/2 cells, we knocked down TGFβ2 expression by shRNAs and examined their capacities to differentiate into motor neurons according to previously established protocols (20Wichterle H. Lieberam I. Porter J.A. Jessell T.M. Cell. 2002; 110: 385-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1418) Google Scholar, 21Mao J. Barrow J. McMahon J. Vaughan J. McMahon A.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: e155Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We found that reduced expression of TGFβ2 prevented purmorphamine-induced motor neuron differentiation, as indicated by lack of HB9 expression and reduced expression of other markers (Fig. 2D). To determine whether TGFβ is sufficient to drive expression of some motor neuron markers in the absence of Hedgehog signaling, we knocked down SMO expression in ES cells and examined the effects of TGFβ2 on motor neuron differentiation. No Hb9 expression was induced by TGFβ2 plus retinoid acid in SMO knockdown cells (supplemental Fig. S5), suggesting that TGFβ signaling alone does not mediate all the functions of Hh signaling and thus is not sufficient to drive motor neuron differentiation. Based on our results, we conclude that TGFβ2 is required but may not be sufficient for Hh signaling-mediated osteoblast and motor neuron differentiation. Because we already know that epidermal activation of Hh signaling is associated with elevated levels of phosphorylated SMAD2 and SMAD3 (supplemental Fig. S2), we tested the effect of SD208, a specific kinase inhibitor of TGFβRI, on SmoM2-mediated carcinogenesis. K14cre/R26SmoM2YFP mice were treated with SD208 by topical application daily for 4 weeks, and the tumor area in the skin of the SD208-treated group was compared with that of the control group. Following topical application of SD208, we did not see changes in animal behavior, body weight, or lifespan, suggesting that topical application of the compound is not very toxic. More importantly, we found that SD208 caused significant reduction of tumor area in the tissue in all mice (n = 6) in comparison with the control group. The reduction of tumor area in mice was about 20% (Fig. 3, A–C). Further analyses indicate that SD208 had no effects on Ki67 positivity (supplemental Fig. S6), the number of blood vessels (angiogenesis) or abnormal nuclear morphology resembling apoptosis in the skin tissues (not shown). Instead, SD208 treatment significantly increased the number of lymphocytes in the skin tissue, a phenotype often associated with reduced immune suppression (Fig. 3, D–F). It is known that TGFβ signaling can reduce the number of tumor-specific cytotoxic T and regulatory T cells (which are capable of eradicating tumor cells) but increase the number of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (which will exert systemic immune suppression leading to tumor tolerance), resulting in accelerated tumor development (23Flavell R.A. Sanjabi S. Wrzesinski S.H. Licona-Limón P. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2010; 10: 554-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). We found that mice treated with SD208 exhibit decreased levels of phosphorylated SMAD2 and SMAD3, markers for TGFβ signaling activation (supplemental Fig. S7), indicating a specific effect of SD208. These results indicate that specific inhibition of TGFβ signaling results in tumor shrinkage derived from SmoM2, at least through regulation of immune surveillance. Understanding the molecular basis by which Hh signaling regulates tumor development is critical for designing strategies for effective cancer therapeutics (24Guo X. Wang X.F. Cell Res. 2009; 19: 71-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). Using a mouse model for SMO-mediated BCC development, we identified changes in several signaling pathways, particularly TGFβ signaling. TGFβ signaling is a known pathway important for tumor development (10Owens P. Han G. Li A.G. Wang X.J. J. Invest. Derm. 2008; 128: 783-790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 11Stover D.G. Bierie B. Moses H.L. J. Cell. Biochem. 2007; 101: 851-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Using two biological assays as well as one BCC mouse model, we demonstrated the critical role of TGFβ signaling in SMO-mediated signaling and cancer development. We also examined the relevance of our studies to human BCCs by examining levels of phosphorylated SMAD2 and SMAD3 (supplemental Fig. S3), which are markers for activated TGFβ signaling. Expression of phosphorylated SMAD2 and SMAD3 in tumor as well as stroma suggests that TGFβ signaling in BCCs functions via both autocrine and paracrine manners. Our data from the mouse model suggest that TGFβ molecules, which are produced in the tumor cells, affect immune surveillance system through paracrine signaling. Whether this finding can be applied to other types of cancer will require further examination. Supplemental Fig. S8 shows our proposed model of TGFβ functions in BCC development. Currently, it is unclear how the autocrine signaling of TGFβ affects BCC cells. Previous publications indicate that TGFβ signaling can regulate epithelial-mesenchymal transition, cell differentiation of cancer cells, and expression of matrix metalloproteinase molecules; the latter are known to regulate tumor invasiveness (28Massagué J. Cell. 2008; 134: 215-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3093) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, our data provide evidence to support that TGFβ signaling is required for Hh signaling-mediated BCC development. Despite the critical role of TGFβ signaling in Hh-mediated biological processes, including carcinogenesis, our data in motor neuron differentiation showed that the addition of TGFβ2 alone was not sufficient to drive the Hh-mediated process in the absence of Hh signaling. Thus, it is predicted that the effect of SD208 (reduction of tumor area by 20%) will not be as effective as Hh signaling-specific inhibitors. Indeed, we found that SMO antagonists (such as cyclopamine derivative Cyc-T and the Genentech GDC-0449) can reduce tumor area by 40% in the same mouse model (data not shown here). Both C3H10T1/2 cells and E14Tg2a cells have the ability to differentiate into different cell types. The fact that TGFβ2 depletion in these cells decreases cell differentiation potentials does not necessarily support that autocrine TGFβ signaling (versus paracrine signaling) plays a major role. It is known that paracrine TGFβ signaling (among different progenitor cells or among the same types of cells) is critical in regulation of embryonic development. Previously, several laboratories reported cross-talks between Hh signaling and the TGFβ pathway (25Alvarez J. Sohn P. Zeng X. Doetschman T. Robbins D.J. Serra R. Development. 2002; 129: 1913-1924Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Dennler S. André J. Alexaki I. Li A. Magnaldo T. ten Dijke P. Wang X.J. Verrecchia F. Mauviel A.

In these reports, they showed direct up-regulation of Gli1/2 by TGFβ-SMAD signaling. Whether this mechanism occurs in our system is not known. Our major finding in this study is that TGFβ signaling is required for Hh signaling-mediated motor neuron differentiation, osteoblast differentiation, and BCC development. It is not known whether the above two signaling events occur in the same system to form a vicious cycle. The canonical Hh signaling is through direct regulation of Hh target gene expression by transcriptional factor Gli molecules. Increasing data indicate that Hh signaling may also be activated by non-canonical pathways such as interactions between EGF and Hh and regulation of Gli molecules by Ras. Although we have shown in a number of biological systems that Hh signaling activation increases the expression of TGFβ signaling, the exact mechanisms remain to be identified. Analysis of TGFβ2 promoters did not reveal exact sequence matches to Gli binding sites, with three weak putative Gli binding sites (six of eight nucleotides matched). 5Q. Fan, M. He, T. Sheng, X. Zhang, M. Sinha, B. Luxon, X. Zhao, and J. Xie, unpublished observations. It is thus possible that TGFβ2 expression is regulated by interaction between Hh signaling and another pathway. In summary, we provided biological evidence to indicate a critical role of TGFβ2 for Hh signaling-mediated biological processes, including tumor development. Despite the requirement of TGFβ signaling for Hh signaling-mediated biological processes, TGFβ alone is not sufficient to replace the roles of Hh signaling. We thank Drs.

https://openalex.org/W2150551630,"Staphylococcus epidermidis is a skin-resident bacterium and a major cause of biomaterial-associated infections. The transition from residing on the skin to residing on an implanted biomaterial is accompanied by regulatory changes that facilitate bacterial survival in the new environment. These regulatory changes are dependent upon the ability of bacteria to ""sense"" environmental changes. In S. epidermidis, disparate environmental signals can affect synthesis of the biofilm matrix polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA). Previously, we demonstrated that PIA biosynthesis is regulated by tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle activity. The observations that very different environmental signals result in a common phenotype (i.e. increased PIA synthesis) and that TCA cycle activity regulates PIA biosynthesis led us to hypothesize that S. epidermidis is ""sensing"" disparate environmental signals through the modulation of TCA cycle activity. In this study, we used NMR metabolomics to demonstrate that divergent environmental signals are transduced into common metabolomic changes that are ""sensed"" by metabolite-responsive regulators, such as CcpA, to affect PIA biosynthesis. These data clarify one mechanism by which very different environmental signals cause common phenotypic changes. In addition, due to the frequency of the TCA cycle in diverse genera of bacteria and the intrinsic properties of TCA cycle enzymes, it is likely the TCA cycle acts as a signal transduction pathway in many bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W1974999735,"Ezrin has been reported to be upregulated in many tumors and to participate in metastatic progression. No study has addressed epigenetic modification in the regulation of Ezrin gene expression, the importance of which is unknown. Here, we report that highly metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) cells with high levels of Ezrin have elevated acetyl-H3-K9 and tri-methyl-H3-K4 as well as reduced DNA methylation at the Ezrin gene promoter. Conversely, poorly metastatic RMS cells with low levels of Ezrin have reduced acetyl-H3-K9 and elevated methylation. Thus epigenetic covalent modifications to histones within nucleosomes of the Ezrin gene promoter are linked to Ezrin expression, which in fact can be regulated by epigenetic mechanisms. Notably, treatment with histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors or DNA demethylating agents could restore Ezrin expression and stimulate the metastatic potential of poorly metastatic RMS cells characterized by low Ezrin levels. However, the ability of epigenetic drugs to stimulate metastasis in RMS cells was inhibited by expression of an Ezrin-specific shRNA. Our data demonstrate the potential risk associated with clinical application of broadly acting covalent epigenetic modifiers, and highlight the value of combination therapies that include agents specifically targeting potent pro-metastatic genes."
https://openalex.org/W2015714992,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder primarily characterized by the deposition of β-amyloid plaques in the brain. Plaques are composed of the amyloid-β peptide derived from cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Mutations in APP lead to the development of Familial Alzheimer's Disease (FAD), however, the normal function of this protein has proven elusive. The organism Caenorhabditis elegans is an attractive model as the amyloid precursor-like protein (APL-1) is the single ortholog of APP, and loss of apl-1 leads to a severe molting defect and early larval lethality.We report here that lethality and molting can be rescued by full length APL-1, C-terminal mutations as well as a C-terminal truncation, suggesting that the extracellular region of the protein is essential for viability. RNAi knock-down of apl-1 followed by drug testing on the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor aldicarb showed that loss of apl-1 leads to aldicarb hypersensitivity, indicating a defect in synaptic function. The aldicarb hypersensitivity can be rescued by full length APL-1 in a dose dependent fashion. At the cellular level, kinesins UNC-104/KIF-1A and UNC-116/kinesin-1 are positive regulators of APL-1 expression in the neurons. Knock-down of the small GTPase rab-5 also leads to a dramatic decrease in the amount of apl-1 expression in neurons, suggesting that trafficking from the plasma membrane to the early endosome is important for apl-1 function. Loss of function of a different small GTPase, UNC-108, on the contrary, leads to the retention of APL-1 in the cell body.Our results reveal novel insights into the intracellular trafficking of APL-1 and we report a functional role for APL-1 in synaptic transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2030539700,"An important functional property of protein protease inhibitors is their stability to proteolysis. Mesotrypsin is a human trypsin that has been implicated in the proteolytic inactivation of several protein protease inhibitors. We have found that bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI), a Kunitz protease inhibitor, inhibits mesotrypsin very weakly and is slowly proteolyzed, whereas, despite close sequence and structural homology, the Kunitz protease inhibitor domain of the amyloid precursor protein (APPI) binds to mesotrypsin 100 times more tightly and is cleaved 300 times more rapidly. To define features responsible for these differences, we have assessed the binding and cleavage by mesotrypsin of APPI and BPTI reciprocally mutated at two nonidentical residues that make direct contact with the enzyme. We find that Arg at P1 (versus Lys) favors both tighter binding and more rapid cleavage, whereas Met (versus Arg) at P′2 favors tighter binding but has minimal effect on cleavage. Surprisingly, we find that the APPI scaffold greatly enhances proteolytic cleavage rates, independently of the binding loop. We draw thermodynamic additivity cycles analyzing the interdependence of P1 and P′2 substitutions and scaffold differences, finding multiple instances in which the contributions of these features are nonadditive. We also report the crystal structure of the mesotrypsin·APPI complex, in which we find that the binding loop of APPI displays evidence of increased mobility compared with BPTI.

Because of the potential for proteolytic damage in living systems, elaborate mechanisms have evolved to regulate proteases. One mechanism for protease regulation involves complex formation with endogenous protein inhibitors. Maintenance of the protease/inhibitor balance is crucial, and the upset of this balance is in evidence in numerous pathological conditions, including cancer, arthritis, pancreatitis, and many vascular, pulmonary, and skin diseases (1Murphy G.

An understanding of the fundamental features that render protein protease inhibitors stable inhibitors versus vulnerable substrates of the proteases that they encounter is critical for understanding the function of these molecules in tissue homeostasis. The structurally diverse “canonical” inhibitors of serine proteases are named for a convex protease-binding loop of highly characteristic backbone conformation that is slightly extended from an inhibitor scaffold and serves as a simple recognition motif (16Bode W. Huber R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 433-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar, 17Apostoluk W. Otlewski J.

One of the largest and best studied families of canonical inhibitors is the Kunitz-BPTI family, the archetypal member of which is bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI), 2The abbreviations used are: BPTIbovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitorAPPamyloid β-protein precursorAPPIKunitz protease inhibitor domain of APPTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycineTLStranslation-libration-screwPDBProtein Data Bank. also known as aprotinin (22Ascenzi P.

The Kunitz protease inhibitor fold is a small, very compact pear-shaped motif of ∼60 amino acids, stabilized by a hydrophobic core and by three disulfide bonds; the canonical loop forms the narrow top of the pear. Kunitz inhibitors include both single domain proteins like BPTI and larger proteins in which the Kunitz domain comprises a functional module within a compound inhibitor or multidomain protein (23Rawlings N.D. Tolle D.P. Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 705-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). For example, the amyloid precursor protein (APP) possesses a functional Kunitz protease inhibitor domain; the secreted ectodomain of APP, also known as protease nexin 2, inhibits coagulation factor XIa via the Kunitz domain, regulating hemostasis and thrombosis (24Smith R.P.

There are 36 human Kunitz domains and homologues, a number of which serve known key functions regulating serine proteases involved in coagulation, fibrinolysis, and tissue remodeling (MEROPS data base, available on the World Wide Web) (28Rawlings N.D.

By contrast, mesotrypsin is far more active than other trypsins in cleavage of canonical protease inhibitors at the reactive site peptide bond (44Szmola R. Kukor Z. Sahin-Tóth M. J. Biol.

Although it seems very likely that a major physiological role of mesotrypsin lies in proteolytic cleavage and inactivation of canonical protein protease inhibitors (44Szmola R. Kukor Z. Sahin-Tóth M.

We have found that BPTI behaves as a temporary inhibitor of mesotrypsin, being gradually cleaved with an enzymatic turnover time of 2.2 h (46Salameh M.A. Soares A.S. Hockla A. Radisky E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 4115-4123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), whereas the isolated Kunitz domain of APP (APPI) is cleaved by mesotrypsin with a kinetic profile more closely resembling that of a true substrate, with an enzymatic turnover time of 24 s (50Salameh M.A. Robinson J.L.

The two inhibitors display striking differences in mesotrypsin affinity as well, with APPI binding ∼100-fold more tightly to the protease than does BPTI (45Katona G. Berglund G.I. Hajdu J. Gráf L.

These functionally contrasting but structurally similar inhibitors offer an ideal model system in which to explore the basis for resistance of Kunitz protease inhibitors to proteolysis by mesotrypsin and potentially offer insights into the fundamental basis of canonical inhibitor resistance to proteolysis more generally. Here, we have taken a mutagenesis approach to dissect the contributions of canonical loop residues and inhibitor scaffolds to the differential proteolytic stability and mesotrypsin affinity of APPI and BPTI. Recombinant human mesotrypsinogen and a catalytically inactive S195A mutant were expressed in Escherichia coli, isolated from inclusion bodies, refolded, purified, and activated with bovine enteropeptidase as described previously (46Salameh M.A. Soares A.S. Hockla A. Radisky E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 4115-4123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Kunitz domain inhibitors were expressed in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris under control of the alcohol oxidase (AOX1) promoter using the expression vector pPICZαA (Invitrogen); construction of the APPI-WT, BPTI-WT, and P1 mutant expression constructs has been described previously (51Navaneetham D.

Berger A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 27: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (4766) Google Scholar); starting from the scissile bond, substrate residues are numbered P1, P2, P3, etc. in the direction of the N terminus (collectively the non-primed residues), and P′1, P′2, P′3, etc. in the direction of the C terminus (collectively the primed residues). Corresponding enzyme subsites are numbered S1, S2, S3, etc. Additional mutations were introduced using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) according to manufacturer protocols; mutant plasmids were verified by sequencing. Expression constructs were linearized with SacI (New England BioLabs) and transformed via electroporation into P. pastoris X33 (Invitrogen). Chromosomal integration was verified by PCR amplification of genomic DNA using AOX1 forward and reverse primers. A number of verified transformants were screened for expression in small scale liquid cultures; those with media revealing the highest levels of trypsin inhibitory activity were selected for large (1 liter) scale expression and purification. Expression cultures grown in BMMY medium (buffered medium containing methanol and yeast nitrogen base) at 30 °C were harvested after 48 h. The supernatant was subjected to ammonium sulfate precipitation (95% saturation) at room temperature. Protein pellets were resuspended in 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.8, and dialyzed overnight against 10 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.8, using 3.5-kDa cut-off dialysis tubing (ThermoScientific). Dialyzed APPI samples were chromatographed on Q-Sepharose FF (GE Healthcare) and eluted with a gradient of 0–100% buffer B (50 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 1 m NaCl). Dialyzed BPTI samples were chromatographed on SP-Sepharose FF (GE Healthcare) and eluted with a gradient of 0–100% buffer B (50 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 1 m NaCl). Both APPI and BPTI proteins were further purified on a trypsin affinity column, as described previously (50Salameh M.A. Robinson J.L. Navaneetham D. Sinha D. Madden B.J. Walsh P.N. Radisky E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 1939-1949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and eluted with a gradient of 0–100% buffer B (150 mm HCl). Protein purity was verified by HPLC using a reversed phase Jupiter 4μ 90-Å C12 column (Phenomenex), to ensure that each inhibitor chromatographed as a single peak. BPTI-R17M and BPTI-K15R/R17M were further purified by HPLC using a reversed phase C18 column (Luna 250 × 10-mm 5μ) (Phenomenex) and a gradient of 0–100% acetonitrile in 0.1% TFA. Mesotrypsin concentration was quantified by active site titration using 4-nitrophenyl 4-guanidinobenzoate (Sigma) (53Chase Jr., T. Shaw E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 29: 508-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). Concentrations of APPI and BPTI variants were determined by titration with bovine trypsin (Sigma) as described previously (46Salameh M.A. Soares A.S. Hockla A. Radisky E.S. J. Biol.

Concentrations of the chromogenic substrate benzyloxycarbonyl-Gly-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanalide (Sigma) were determined by an end point assay. Working stocks of enzyme, substrate, and inhibitors were prepared, and assays were conducted as described previously (46Salameh M.A. Soares A.S. Hockla A. Radisky E.S. J. Biol.

Briefly, reactions carried out at 37 °C in a Varian Cary-100 spectrophotometer were followed spectroscopically for 3–5 min, and initial rates were determined from the absorbance increase caused by the release of p-nitroaniline (ϵ410 = 8480 m−1 cm−1) (54DelMar E.G. Largman C. Brodrick J.W. Geokas M.C. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 99: 316-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Data were globally fitted by multiple regression to Equation 1, the classic competitive inhibition equation, using Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego CA). Reported inhibition constants are average values obtained from 2–4 independent experiments. v=kcat[E]0[S]Km(1+[l]/Ki)+[S](Eq. 1) The depletion of intact APPI and BPTI variants in time course incubations with active mesotrypsin was monitored by HPLC and 16% SDS-Tricine PAGE (55Schägger H. von Jagow G.

John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2001: 10.10.10-10.11.34Google Scholar). Mesotrypsin concentrations were optimized in order to achieve a comparable degree of digestion within a similar time frame for different inhibitor variants. Incubations of mesotrypsin with BPTI mutants were carried out in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 1 mm CaCl2 at 37 °C; BPTI concentration was 50 μm, and mesotrypsin concentration was 5 μm (for BPTI-WT and BPTI-R17M), 2.5 μm (for BPTI-K15R), or 1.25 μm (for BPTI-K15R/R17M). Aliquots for HPLC analysis were withdrawn at periodic intervals, adjusted to 6 m urea and 2 mm DTT, incubated for 10 min at 37 °C, quenched by acidification to pH 1, and then frozen at −20 °C until analyzed as previously reported (46Salameh M.A. Soares A.S. Hockla A. Radisky E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 4115-4123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Incubations of mesotrypsin with APPI mutants were carried out similarly, except that APPI concentration was 50 μm, and mesotrypsin concentration was 500 nm (for APPI-R15K and APPI-R15K/M17R) or 50 nm (for APPI-WT and APPI-M17R). APPI hydrolysis time point samples were not denatured or reduced; instead, samples were quenched immediately by acidification to pH 1 and then frozen at −20 °C until analyzed. Enzyme, Kunitz inhibitors, and hydrolysis products were resolved on a 50 × 2.0-mm Jupiter 4μ 90-Å C12 column (Phenomenex) with a gradient of 0–100% acetonitrile in 0.1% TFA at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min over 50 min. Peak integration to quantify the disappearance of intact Kunitz inhibitors over time was carried out as described previously (46Salameh M.A. Soares A.S. Hockla A. Radisky E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 4115-4123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar); initial rates were obtained by linear regression using a minimum of six data points within the initial linear phase of the reaction and not exceeding 50% conversion of intact inhibitor to hydrolysis products. Hydrolysis rates reported for each inhibitor represent the average of 2–4 independent experiments. Complexes of catalytically inactive mesotrypsin-S195A with APPI and APPI-R15K were crystallized by vapor diffusion. Mesotrypsin-S195A dissolved in 1 mm HCl and APPI dissolved in 10 mm NaOAc, pH 6.5, were mixed in a 1:1 stoichiometric molar ratio to achieve a total protein concentration of 3–6 mg/ml. Crystals were grown at 22 °C in hanging drops over a reservoir of 4.5 m sodium formate. Drops (4 μl) were prepared by mixing equal volumes of protein and reservoir solutions. Crystals (0.1 × 0.2 × 0.1 mm) appeared within 4 days and grew over the course of 3 weeks. Crystals were harvested, soaked in a cryoprotectant solution (4.5 m sodium formate and 17.5% glycerol), and flash-frozen in liquid N2. Synchrotron x-ray data were collected from crystals at 100 K using ADSC CCD detectors at beamlines X12-B, X12-C, and X25 at the National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven National Laboratory. Mesotrypsin·APPI and mesotrypsin·APPI-R15K complex crystals belong to space group P22121 with unit cell parameters of a = 92.8, b = 130.1, c = 132.3 and a = 92.9, b = 131.4, c = 131.9, respectively, and α = β = γ = 90°. Diffraction data were measured to 2.48 and 2.38 Å resolution for mesotrypsin·APPI and mesotrypsin·APPI-R15K complexes, respectively. The automation package ELVES (57Holton J. Alber T. Proc. Natl.

The solved structure of the mesotrypsin·APPI complex was used as a model for the mesotrypsin·APPI-R15K complex structure. The successful solution contained four copies of each protein in the asymmetric unit, forming four canonical trypsin·APPI complexes. Cycles of manual rebuilding in COOT (62Emsley P. Cowtan K.

Non-crystallographic symmetry restraints were not used in refinement. TLS refinement was employed, with each protein chain assigned to a separate TLS group. Waters, ions, and alternative conformations of protein residues were added using COOT (62Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1979663953,"Galectin-9, a tandem-repeat-type β-galactoside-specific animal lectin with two carbohydrate recognition domains (CRDs) at the N- and C-terminal ends, is involved in chemoattraction, apoptosis, and the regulation of cell differentiation and has anti-allergic effects. Its ability to recognize carbohydrates is essential for its biological functions. Human galectin-9 (hG9) has high affinity for branched N-glycan-type oligosaccharides (dissociation constants of 0.16-0.70 μM) and linear β1-3-linked poly-N-acetyllactosamines (0.09-8.3 μM) and significant affinity for the α2-3-sialylated oligosaccharides (17-34 μM). Further, its N-terminal CRD (hG9N) and C-terminal CRD (hG9C) differ in specificity. To elucidate this unique feature of hG9, x-ray structures of hG9C in the free form and in complexes with N-acetyllactosamine, the biantennary pyridylaminated oligosaccharide, and α2-3-sialyllactose were determined. They are the first x-ray structural analysis of C-terminal CRD of the tandem-repeat-type galectin. The results clearly revealed the mechanism by which branched and α2-3-sialylated oligosaccharides are recognized and explained the difference in specificity between hG9N and hG9C. Based on structural comparisons with other galectins, we propose that the wide entrance for ligand binding and the shallow binding site of hG9C are favorable for branched oligosaccharides and that Arg(221) is responsible for recognizing sialylated oligosaccharides."
https://openalex.org/W2027582936,"The sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) of skeletal muscle contains K(+), Cl(-), and H(+) channels may facilitate charge neutralization during Ca(2+) release. Our recent studies have identified trimeric intracellular cation (TRIC) channels on SR as an essential counter-ion permeability pathway associated with rapid Ca(2+) release from intracellular stores. Skeletal muscle contains TRIC-A and TRIC-B isoforms as predominant and minor components, respectively. Here we test the physiological function of TRIC-A in skeletal muscle. Biochemical assay revealed abundant expression of TRIC-A relative to the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor with a molar ratio of TRIC-A/ryanodine receptor ∼5:1. Electron microscopy with the tric-a(-/-) skeletal muscle showed Ca(2+) overload inside the SR with frequent formation of Ca(2+) deposits compared with the wild type muscle. This elevated SR Ca(2+) pool in the tric-a(-/-) muscle could be released by caffeine, whereas the elemental Ca(2+) release events, e.g. osmotic stress-induced Ca(2+) spark activities, were significantly reduced likely reflecting compromised counter-ion movement across the SR. Ex vivo physiological test identified the appearance of ""alternan"" behavior with isolated tric-a(-/-) skeletal muscle, i.e. transient and drastic increase in contractile force appeared within the decreasing force profile during repetitive fatigue stimulation. Inhibition of SR/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+ ATPase) function could lead to aggravation of the stress-induced alternans in the tric-a(-/-) muscle. Our data suggests that absence of TRIC-A may lead to Ca(2+) overload in SR, which in combination with the reduced counter-ion movement may lead to instability of Ca(2+) movement across the SR membrane. The observed alternan behavior with the tric-a(-/-) muscle may reflect a skeletal muscle version of store overload-induced Ca(2+) release that has been reported in the cardiac muscle under stress conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1979581081,"Bartonella species cospeciate with mammals and live within erythrocytes. Even in these specific niches, it has been recently suggested by bioinformatic analysis of full genome sequences that Lateral Gene Transfer (LGT) may occur but this has never been demonstrated biologically. Here we describe the sequence of the B. rattaustraliani (AUST/NH4(T)) circular plasmid (pNH4) that encodes the tra cluster of the Type IV secretion system (T4SS) and we eventually provide evidence that Bartonella species may conjugate and exchange this plasmid inside amoeba.The T4SS of pNH4 is critical for intracellular viability of bacterial pathogens, exhibits bioinformatic evidence of LGT among bacteria living in phagocytic protists. For instance, 3 out of 4 T4SS encoding genes from pNH4 appear to be closely related to Rhizobiales, suggesting that gene exchange occurs between intracellular bacteria from mammals (bartonellae) and plants (Rhizobiales). We show that B. rattaustraliani and Rhizobium radiobacter both survived within the amoeba Acanthamoeba polyphaga and can conjugate together. Our findings further support the hypothesis that tra genes might also move into and out of bacterial communities by conjugation, which might be the primary means of genomic evolution for intracellular adaptation by cross-talk of interchangeable genes between Bartonella species and plant pathogens.Based on this, we speculate that amoeba favor the transfer of genes as phagocytic protists, which allows for intraphagocytic survival and, as a consequence, promotes the creation of potential pathogenic organisms."
https://openalex.org/W1985810025,"Background Effective and timely case management remains one of the fundamental pillars for control of malaria. Tanzania introduced artemisinin-combination therapy [ACT] for uncomplicated malaria; however, the policy change is challenged by limited availability of ACTs due to high cost. This study aimed to determine factors influencing prompt access to ACTs among febrile children in rural Kilosa, Tanzania. Methods and Findings In a community-based study, 1,235 randomly selected children under five were followed up weekly for six months, in 2008. Using a structured questionnaire, children's caretakers were asked about the child's febrile history in the last seven days, and treatment actions including timing, medicines used and source of care. Caretakers' knowledge about malaria and socioeconomic and demographic data were also obtained. About half of followed-up children had at least one episode of fever. Less than half (44.8%) of febrile children were taken to government facilities. Almost one-third (37.6%; 95% CI 33.1–42.1) of febrile children had prompt access to ACT. Care-seeking from a government facility was the overriding factor, increasing the likelihood of prompt access to an ACT 18 times (OR 17.7; 95% CI 10.55–29.54; adjusted OR 16.9; 95% CI 10.06–28.28). Caretakers from the better-off household (3rd–5th quintiles) were more likely to seek care from government facilities (OR 3.66; 95% CI 2.56–5.24; adjusted OR 1.80; 95% CI 1.18–2.76). The majority of antimalarials accessed by the poor were ineffective [86.0%; 295/343], however, they paid more for them (median Tsh 500) compared to the better-offs (median Tsh 0). Conclusions Prompt access to ACT among febrile children was unacceptably low, due mainly to limited availability of subsidised ACT at the location where most caretakers sought care. There is urgent need to accelerate implementation of strategies that will ensure availability of ACT at an affordable price in remote rural areas, where the burden of malaria is highest."
https://openalex.org/W2001699429,"Life history trade-offs have often been assumed to be the consequence of restrictions in the availability of critical resources such as energy and nutrients, which necessitate the differential allocation of resources to costly traits. Here, we examined endocrine (testosterone) and health (parasite burdens) parameters in territorial and non-territorial New Zealand fur seal males. We documented intra-sexual differences in sexual behaviours, testosterone levels, and parasitism that suggest a trade-off exists between reproductive success and physical health, particularly susceptibility to helminths and acanthocephalans, in males displaying different mating tactics (i.e., territorial and non-territorial tactics). Levels of testosterone were higher in territorial males and correlated positively with reproductive effort (i.e., intra- and inter-sexual interactions). However, these territorial males also exhibited high levels of parasitic infection, which may impair survival in the long-term. Our study, while limited in sample size, provides preliminary evidence for a link between male mating tactics, testosterone levels and parasite loads, and potential effects on reproductive success and life history that should be explored further."

https://openalex.org/W2089663794,"Background Hemozoin (Hz) is a heme crystal that represents a vital pathway for heme disposal in several blood-feeding organisms. Recent evidence demonstrated that β-hematin (βH) (the synthetic counterpart of Hz) formation occurs under physiological conditions near synthetic or biological hydrophilic-hydrophobic interfaces. This seems to require a heme dimer acting as a precursor of Hz crystals that would be formed spontaneously in the absence of the competing water molecules bound to the heme iron. Here, we aimed to investigate the role of medium polarity on spontaneous βH formation in vitro. Methodology/Principal Findings We assessed the effect of water content on spontaneous βH formation by using the aprotic solvent dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and a series of polyethyleneglycols (PEGs). We observed that both DMSO and PEGs (3.350, 6.000, 8.000, and 22.000) increased the levels of soluble heme under acidic conditions. These compounds were able to stimulate the production of βH crystals in the absence of any biological sample. Interestingly, the effects of DMSO and PEGs on βH formation were positively correlated with their capacity to promote previous heme solubilization in acidic conditions. Curiously, a short chain polyethyleneglycol (PEG 300) caused a significant reduction in both soluble heme levels and βH formation. Finally, both heme solubilization and βH formation strongly correlated with reduced medium water activity provided by increased DMSO concentrations. Conclusions The data presented here support the notion that reduction of the water activity is an important mechanism to support spontaneous heme crystallization, which depends on the previous increase of soluble heme levels."
https://openalex.org/W2017475690,"Coat protein complex I (COPI) vesicles play a central role in the recycling of proteins in the early secretory pathway and transport of proteins within the Golgi stack. Vesicle formation is initiated by the exchange of GDP for GTP on ARF1 (ADP-ribosylation factor 1), which, in turn, recruits the coat protein coatomer to the membrane for selection of cargo and membrane deformation. ARFGAP1 (ARF1 GTPase-activating protein 1) regulates the dynamic cycling of ARF1 on the membrane that results in both cargo concentration and uncoating for the generation of a fusion-competent vesicle. Two human orthologues of the yeast ARFGAP Glo3p, termed ARFGAP2 and ARFGAP3, have been demonstrated to be present on COPI vesicles generated in vitro in the presence of guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate. Here, we investigate the function of these two proteins in living cells and compare it with that of ARFGAP1. We find that ARFGAP2 and ARFGAP3 follow the dynamic behavior of coatomer upon stimulation of vesicle budding in vivo more closely than does ARFGAP1. Electron microscopy of ARFGAP2 and ARFGAP3 knockdowns indicated Golgi unstacking and cisternal shortening similarly to conditions where vesicle uncoating was blocked. Furthermore, the knockdown of both ARFGAP2 and ARFGAP3 prevents proper assembly of the COPI coat lattice for which ARFGAP1 does not seem to play a major role. This suggests that ARFGAP2 and ARFGAP3 are key components of the COPI coat lattice and are necessary for proper vesicle formation."
https://openalex.org/W2092479921,"Cellular responses to drug treatment show tremendous variations. Elucidating mechanisms underlying these variations is critical for predicting therapeutic responses and developing personalized therapeutics. Using a small molecule screening approach, we discovered how a disease causing allele leads to opposing cell fates upon pharmacological perturbation. Diverse microtubule-depolymerizing agents protected mutant huntingtin-expressing cells from cell death, while being toxic to cells lacking mutant huntingtin or those expressing wild-type huntingtin. Additional neuronal cell lines and primary neurons from Huntington disease mice also showed altered survival upon microtubule depolymerization. Transcription profiling revealed that microtubule depolymerization induced the autocrine growth factor connective tissue growth factor and activated ERK survival signaling. The genotype-selective rescue was dependent upon increased RhoA protein levels in mutant huntingtin-expressing cells, because inhibition of RhoA, its downstream effector, Rho-associated kinase (ROCK), or a microtubule-associated RhoA activator, guanine nucleotide exchange factor-H1 (GEF-H1), all attenuated the rescue. Conversely, RhoA overexpression in cells lacking mutant huntingtin conferred resistance to microtubule-depolymerizer toxicity. This study elucidates a novel pathway linking microtubule stability to cell survival and provides insight into how genetic context can dramatically alter cellular responses to pharmacological interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2086696350,"Cancer subtype classification and survival prediction both relate directly to patients' specific treatment plans, making them fundamental medical issues. Although the two factors are interrelated learning problems, most studies tackle each separately. In this paper, expression levels of genes are used for both cancer subtype classification and survival prediction. We considered 350 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) subjects, taken from four groups of patients (activated B-cell-like subtype dead, activated B-cell-like subtype alive, germinal center B-cell-like subtype dead, and germinal center B-cell-like subtype alive). As classification features, we used 11,271 gene expression levels of each subject. The features were first ranked by mRMR (Maximum Relevance Minimum Redundancy) principle and further selected by IFS (Incremental Feature Selection) procedure. Thirty-five gene signatures were selected after the IFS procedure, and the patients were divided into the above mentioned four groups. These four groups were combined in different ways for subtype prediction and survival prediction, specifically, the activated versus the germinal center and the alive versus the dead. Subtype prediction accuracy of the 35-gene signature was 98.6%. We calculated cumulative survival time of high-risk group and low-risk groups by the Kaplan-Meier method. The log-rank test p-value was 5.98e-08. Our methodology provides a way to study subtype classification and survival prediction simultaneously. Our results suggest that for some diseases, especially cancer, subtype classification may be used to predict survival, and, conversely, survival prediction features may shed light on subtype features."
https://openalex.org/W1996183957,"ID2 is a rhythmically expressed HLH transcriptional repressor. Deletion of Id2 in mice results in circadian phenotypes, highlighted by disrupted locomotor activity rhythms and an enhanced photoentrainment response. ID2 can suppress the transactivation potential of the positive elements of the clock, CLOCK-BMAL1, on mPer1 and clock-controlled gene (CCG) activity. Misregulation of CCGs is observed in Id2−/− liver, and mutant mice exhibit associated alterations in lipid homeostasis. These data suggest that ID2 contributes to both input and output components of the clock and that this may be via interaction with the bHLH clock proteins CLOCK and BMAL1. The aim of the present study was to explore this potential interaction. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis revealed the capability of ID2 to complex with both CLOCK and BMAL1, and mammalian two-hybrid analysis revealed direct interactions of ID2, ID1 and ID3 with CLOCK and BMAL1. Deletion of the ID2 HLH domain rendered ID2 ineffective at inhibiting CLOCK-BMAL1 transactivation, suggesting that interaction between the proteins is via the HLH region. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed overlapping localization of ID2 with CLOCK and BMAL1 in the cytoplasm. Overexpression of CLOCK and BMAL1 in the presence of ID2 resulted in a significant reduction in their nuclear localization, revealing that ID2 can sequester CLOCK and BMAL1 to the cytoplasm. Serum stimulation of Id2−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts resulted in an enhanced induction of mPer1 expression.

https://openalex.org/W1983007681,"Background I-kappa B kinase 2 (IKK2 or IKK-beta) is one of the most crucial signaling kinases for activation of NF-kappa B, a transcription factor that is important for inflammation, cell survival and differentiation. Since many NF-kappa B activating pathways converge at the level of IKK2, molecular interactions of this kinase are pivotal for regulation of NF-kappa B signaling. Methodology/Principal Findings We searched for proteins interacting with IKK2 using the C-terminal part (amino acids 466–756) as bait in a yeast two-hybrid system and identified the N-terminal part (amino acids 1–228) of the TNF-receptor associated factor TRAF1 as putative interaction partner. The interaction was confirmed in human cells by mammalian two-hybrid and coimmunoprecipitation experiments. The IKK2/TRAF1 interaction seemed weaker than the interaction between TRAF1 and TRAF2, an important activating adapter molecule of NF-kappa B signaling. Reporter gene and kinase assays using ectopic expression of TRAF1 indicated that it can both activate and inhibit IKK2 and NF-kappa B. Co-expression of fluorescently tagged TRAF1 and TRAF2 at different ratios implied that TRAF1 can affect clustering and presumably the activating function of TRAF2 in a dose dependent manner. Conclusions/Significance The observation that TRAF1 can either activate or inhibit the NF-kappa B pathway and the fact that it influences the oligomerization of TRAF2 indicates that relative levels of IKK2, TRAF1 and TRAF2 may be important for regulation of NF-kappa B activity. Since TRAF1 is an NF-kappa B induced gene, it might act as a feedback effector molecule."
https://openalex.org/W2159312877,"Influenza virus transcription is a prototype of primer-dependent initiation. Its replication mechanism is thought to be primer-independent. The internal initiation and realignment model for influenza virus genome replication has been recently proposed (Deng, T., Vreede, F. T., and Brownlee, G. G. (2006) J. Virol. 80, 2337-2348). We obtained new results, which led us to propose a novel model for the initiation of viral RNA (vRNA) replication. In our study, we analyzed the initiation mechanisms of influenza virus vRNA and complementary RNA (cRNA) synthesis in vitro, using purified RNA polymerase (RdRp) and 84-nt model RNA templates. We found that, for vRNA → cRNA →, RdRp initiated replication from the second nucleotide of the 3'-end. Therefore, host RNA-specific ribonucleotidyltransferases are required to add one nucleotide (purine residues are preferred) to the 3'-end of vRNA to make the complete copy of vRNA. This hypothesis was experimentally proven using poly(A) polymerase. For cRNA → vRNA, the dinucleotide primer AG was synthesized from UC (fourth and fifth from the 3'-end) by RdRp pausing at the sixth U of UUU and realigning at the 3'-end of cRNA template; then RdRp was able to read through the entire template RNA. The RdRp initiation complex was not stable until it had read through the UUU of cRNA and the UUUU of vRNA at their respective 3'-ends. This was because primers overlapping with the first U of the clusters did not initiate transcription efficiently, and the initiation product of v84+G (the v84 template with an extra G at its 3'-end), AGC, realigned to the 3'-end."
https://openalex.org/W2070593573,"The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channel, an ATP binding cassette (ABC) protein whose defects cause the deadly genetic disease cystic fibrosis (CF), encompasses two nucleotide binding domains (NBD1 and NBD2). Recent studies indicate that in the presence of ATP, the two NBDs coalesce into a dimer, trapping an ATP molecule in each of the two interfacial composite ATP binding sites (site 1 and site 2). Experimental evidence also suggests that CFTR gating is mainly controlled by ATP binding and hydrolysis in site 2, whereas site 1, which harbors several non-canonical substitutions in ATP-interacting motifs, is considered degenerated. The CF-associated mutation G551D, by introducing a bulky and negatively charged side chain into site 2, completely abolishes ATP-induced openings of CFTR. Here, we report a strategy to optimize site 1 for ATP binding by converting two amino acid residues to ABC consensus (i.e. H1348G) or more commonly seen residues in other ABC proteins (i.e. W401Y,W401F). Introducing either one or both of these mutations into G551D-CFTR confers ATP responsiveness for this disease-associated mutant channel. We further showed that the same maneuver also improved the function of WT-CFTR and the most common CF-associated ΔF508 channels, both of which rely on site 2 for gating control. Thus, our results demonstrated that the degenerated site 1 can be rebuilt to complement or support site 2 for CFTR function. Possible approaches for developing CFTR potentiators targeting site 1 will be discussed."

The muscles of mdx mice express normal amounts of mRNA for the DAPC components, thus suggesting post-transcriptional regulation.We investigated the hypothesis that DAPC reduction could be associated with the microRNA system. Among the possible microRNAs (miRs) found to be upregulated in the skeletal muscle tissue of mdx compared to wt mice, we demonstrated that miR-222 specifically binds to the 3'-UTR of β1-syntrophin and participates in the downregulation of β1-syntrophin. In addition, we documented an altered regulation of the 3'-UTR of β1-syntrophin in muscle tissue from dystrophic mice.These results show the importance of the microRNA system in the regulation of DAPC components in dystrophic muscle, and suggest a potential role of miRs in the pathophysiology of dystrophy."
https://openalex.org/W2006468535,"Uncoupling of NO production from NADPH oxidation by endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) is enhanced in hyperglycemic endothelium, potentially due to dissociation of heat shock proteins 90 (Hsp90), and cellular glucose homeostasis is enhanced by a ROS-induced positive feed back mechanism. In this study we investigated how such an uncoupling impacts oxygen metabolism and how the oxidative phosphorylation can be preserved by heat shock (42 °C for 2 h, hyperthermia) in bovine aortic endothelial cells. Normal and heat-shocked bovine aortic endothelial cells were exposed to normoglycemia (NG, 5.0 mM) or hyperglycemia (30 mM). With hyperglycemia treatment, O(2) consumption rate was reduced (from V(O(2)max) = 7.51 ± 0.54 to 2.35 ± 0.27 mm Hg/min/10(6) cells), whereas in heat-shocked cells, O(2) consumption rate remained unaltered (8.19 ± 1.01 mm Hg/min/10 × 10(6) cells). Heat shock was found to enhance Hsp90/endothelial NOS interactions and produce higher NO. Moreover, ROS generation in the hyperglycemic condition was also reduced in heat-shocked cells. Interestingly, glucose uptake was reduced in heat-shocked cells as a result of decrease in Glut-1 protein level. Glucose phosphate dehydrogenase activity that gives rise to NADPH generation was increased by hyperthermia, and mitochondrial oxidative metabolism was preserved. In conclusion, the present study provides a novel mechanism wherein the reduced oxidative stress in heat-shocked hyperglycemic cells down-regulates Glut-1 and glucose uptake, and fine-tuning of this pathway may be a potential approach to use for therapeutic benefit of diabetes mellitus."

Although ectopic expression of hTERTC27 upregulated genes that are involved in apoptosis, cell cycle, and immune response, the mechanism for hTERTC27-induced tumor suppression has not been completely elucidated. Since hTERT was identified as a universal tumor-associated antigen, we hypothesize that hTERTC27 inhibits tumor growth in vivo through activation of anti-tumor immune response.Immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice were used for mouse B16 melanoma model. Mice bearing B16 melanoma were administered rAAV-/rAdv viral cocktail expressing hTERTC27, and tumor growth was monitored after viral cocktail treatment. Blood and splenocytes were used to determine the level of cytokines and the activity of immune cells, respectively. B16 tumor growth was significantly inhibited by subcutaneous administration of a single dose of 1.5×10(11) vg rAAV-hTERTC27 and 2.5×10(9) pfu rAdv-hTERTC27 viral cocktail (rAAV-/rAdv-hTERTC27). The population and cytotoxicity of NK cells in the mice were significantly augmented by rAAV-/rAdv-hTERTC27 treatment, and selective depletion of the NK cell population in mice by intraperitoneal injection of anti-GM1 antibody abrogated the growth suppression of melanoma induced by rAAV-/rAdv-hTERTC27 administration.Activation of NK cells by administration of rAAV-/rAdv-hTERTC27 is critical for growth suppression of melanoma in mouse model."

Initial folding of the heavy chain involves its glycan-dependent association with calreticulin (CRT), calnexin (CNX), and the thiol oxidoreductase ERp57, and is followed by assembly with β2m to form the heterodimer. Here we show that in CRT-deficient cells CD1d heavy chains convert to β2m-associated dimers at an accelerated rate, indicating faster folding of the heavy chain, while the rate of intracellular transport after assembly is unaffected.

Instead, there are elevated levels of stable and functional CD1d on the surface of CRT-deficient cells. Association of the heavy chains with the ER chaperones Grp94 and Bip is observed in the absence of CRT, and these may replace CRT in mediating CD1d folding and assembly. ER retention of free CD1d heavy chains is impaired in CRT-deficient cells, allowing their escape and subsequent expression on the plasma membrane.

Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 819-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Each consists of a transmembrane heavy chain that non-covalently associates with β2m. The heavy chain can be further divided into three extracellular domains (α1, α2 and α3), a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic region. The α1 and α2 domains fold to generate a binding pocket that, unlike MHC class I and class II glycoproteins, which associate with short peptides, binds a lipid. The lipid binding pocket is similar to the peptide binding pocket of MHC molecules, consisting of a pair of antiparallel α-helices overlaying an eight strand β-sheet. CD1 binding pockets are deep and highly hydrophobic, and can accommodate the alkyl chains of a wide variety of lipids (4Silk J.D. Salio M. Brown J. Jones E.Y. Cerundolo V. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2008; 24: 369-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Similar to the way that MHC class I- and class II-restricted T cells can recognize peptide antigens presented by MHC glycoproteins, lipid antigens associated with CD1 molecules can also be recognized by effector T cells (5Beckman E.M.

In particular, CD1d molecules present lipids to a unique subpopulation of T lymphocytes, called NKT cells, which co-express an invariant T cell receptor (TCR) and surface markers also found on natural killer (NK) cells (7Bendelac A.

Recent data have shown that both endogenous lipids and exogenous lipids, e.g. from Sphingomonas and Borrelia burgdorferi species, can be presented to NKT cells by CD1d molecules (8Wang J. Li Y.

Upon activation, NKT cells secrete both T helper type 1 and type 2 cytokines, and play important roles in both innate and adaptive immunity (13Bendelac A. Savage P.B. Teyton L. Annu. Rev.

The presentation of lipid antigens depends on the proper assembly and intracellular trafficking of CD1 glycoproteins. Shortly after their synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and assembly with β2m, CD1d molecules follow the secretory pathway to the cell surface (14Brutkiewicz R.R. Bennink J.R. Yewdell J.W.

From there, CD1d is routed to endosomal compartments by a tyrosine-based motif, YXXZ (where Y is tyrosine, X is any amino acid, and Z is a bulky hydrophobic amino acid), located in its cytoplasmic domain (16Jayawardena-Wolf J. Benlagha K. Chiu Y.H. Mehr R. Bendelac A. Immunity. 2001; 15: 897-908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Adaptor proteins (AP) bind to this motif at the plasma membrane and direct the internalization of CD1d molecules via clathrin-coated pits (17Elewaut D. Lawton A.P. Nagarajan N.A. Maverakis E.

Traffic. 2006; 7: 2-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Binding of lipid antigens to CD1d molecules occurs mainly in the endocytic system and is catalyzed by endosomal lipid transfer proteins, predominantly the saposins (19Zhou D. Cantu 3rd, C. Sagiv Y.

Abolishing endosomal targeting of CD1d, by mutating the endocytic motif, or disrupting lysosomal acidification, which affects saposin function, significantly impairs antigen presentation by CD1d (22Chiu Y.H.

In addition to accessing the endocytic pathway by AP-dependent endocytosis, CD1d molecules can also be directed there through an interaction with the invariant chain, normally responsible for the endocytic localization of MHC class II molecules, or by an association with MHC class II-invariant chain complexes (16Jayawardena-Wolf J. Benlagha K. Chiu Y.H. Mehr R. Bendelac A. Immunity. 2001; 15: 897-908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 24Kang S.J. Cresswell P. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1650-1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The functional significance of this alternative route for endosomal assessment is unclear. Nevertheless, there is evidence that CD1d molecules can undergo multiple rounds of recycling between the cell surface and endosomal compartments to extensively survey changes in lipid composition (16Jayawardena-Wolf J. Benlagha K. Chiu Y.H. Mehr R. Bendelac A. Immunity. 2001; 15: 897-908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 22Chiu Y.H. Park S.H. Benlagha K. Forestier C.

Associated lipid antigens are presented at the plasma membrane for NKT cell recognition. Previous studies have identified accessory molecules involved in the early biogenesis of CD1d molecules inside the ER (14Brutkiewicz R.R. Bennink J.R. Yewdell J.W. Bendelac A. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1913-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 15Kang S.J. Cresswell P. J. Biol.

Like other glycoproteins, the correct folding of CD1d involves the lectin chaperones (15Kang S.J. Cresswell P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44838-44844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). After translocation into the ER, newly synthesized CD1d heavy chains are rapidly glycosylated and bind caltreticulin (CRT) and calnexin (CNX), which recognize monoglucosylated N-linked glycans. These ER chaperones recruit the thiol oxidoreductase ERp57, which catalyzes disulfide bond formation in CD1d heavy chains. Once released from the CNX/CRT cycle, fully oxidized CD1d heavy chains associate with β2m and enter the Golgi where the glycans are further processed before transport to the plasma membrane. Unlike MHC class I and CD1b molecules, association with β2m is not strictly required for CD1d to exit the ER and small amounts of free CD1d heavy chains expressed on the cell surface may still be functional (26Balk S.P.

Consistent with the hypothesis that CD1 molecules are loaded with endogenous lipids during assembly inside the ER, multiple groups have found the association of ER-derived lipids with ER-retained or -secreted soluble CD1d (30Yuan W.

Loading of ER-derived lipids to nascent CD1d molecules may be mediated by microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP), the only known lipid transfer protein found in the ER (33Dougan S.K. Salas A.

Invest. 2010; 120: 2889-2899Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However the role of lipids in the quality control of CD1d assembly is poorly understood. The assembly of MHC class I molecules also requires lectin chaperones, including CRT. The role of CRT in MHC class I antigen presentation has been studied in CRT-deficient murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (35Gao B. Adhikari R. Howarth M. Nakamura K. Gold M.C. Hill A.B. Knee R. Michalak M. Elliott T. Immunity. 2002; 16: 99-109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 36Howe C. Garstka M. Al-Balushi M. Ghanem E. Antoniou A.N. Fritzsche S. Jankevicius G. Kontouli N. Schneeweiss C. Williams A. Elliott T. Springer S. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 3730-3744Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In such cells, MHC class I molecules assemble with β2m normally and move to the cell surface with accelerated kinetics. However, loading with optimal peptides within the peptide loading complex inside the ER is defective. Consequently a large fraction of MHC class I associates with low-affinity peptides and is unstable, and T cell recognition is impaired. These results demonstrated a key role for CRT in the quality control of class I-peptide complexes, and inspired us to examine the role of CRT in the assembly and function of CD1d molecules. In this study, we have examined the assembly and antigen presentation functions of CD1d in CRT-deficient MEFs. We find that neither of these functions is impaired. Instead, we observed accelerated conversion of CD1d free heavy chains to β2m-associated dimers and the accumulation of elevated levels of stable and functional dimers on the cell surface. However, ER retention of free CD1d heavy chains is not efficient in the absence of CRT, resulting in the expression of free heavy chains on the plasma membrane. Wild-type (K41) and CRT-deficient (K42) fibroblasts were gifts from Dr. David Williams, University of Toronto. The fibroblasts and their transfectants were maintained in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone) at 37 °C in 5% CO2 atmosphere. The mouse Vα14Jα18 invariant TCR-positive cell hybridoma, DN32.D3, was kindly provided by Dr. Albert Bendelac, University of Chicago. The RetroMax Retroviral System (Imgenex) was used to express CD1d in K41 and K42 cells. Briefly, human CD1d cDNA was subcloned into the MSCV2.2 IRES-GFP vector to generate a CD1d-IRES-GFP construct. The vector was co-transfected into the packaging cell line 293T with pCL-Eco packing vector. 24–48h after transfection the virus supernatant was harvested to infect K41 and K42 cells and stable transfectants were sorted by flow cytometry using GFP expression. The pQCXIH vector containing wild-type mouse CRT cDNA was provided by Dr. D. Williams and was transduced into K42.CD1d cells as described (37Ireland B.S. Brockmeier U. Howe C.M. Elliott T.

For quantitative Western blots, the protein content of the post-nuclear supernatant was quantified by Bradford assay (BioRad) and 3-fold serial dilutions were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Following primary antibody incubation, membranes were probed with alkaline phosphatase-coupled secondary antibody (1:5000) (Jackson Labs) and imaged using a fluorimager with ECF substrate (Amersham Biosciences). MEF transfectants were harvested, washed, starved for 1 h in medium without methionine/cysteine, pulse-labeled with 35S labeling mix (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), chased in an excess of unlabeled methionine/cysteine for the indicated times and washed with cold PBS. For experiments examining the lectin-mediated retention of CD1d within the ER, cells were starved and labeled without castanospermine (CST) (Sigma) and chased in the presence of 2 mm CST as indicated. For all immunoprecipitation experiments except as otherwise indicated, cells were solubilized in 1% digitonin in TBS with a proteinase inhibitor mixture (Roche). Post-nuclear supernatants were precleared with normal rabbit or mouse serum and protein G-Sepharose (GE healthcare) prior to specific immunoprecipitation with the indicated antibody and protein G-Sepharose. For re-precipitation, immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted by heating to 95 °C in 1% SDS, 5 mm dithiothreitol. The eluted material was then diluted into 1% Triton X-100 in TBS and free CD1d heavy chains precipitated with D5 mAb and protein G-Sepharose prior to SDS-PAGE. When Endo H digestion was performed, precipitated proteins were eluted using Endo H buffer, and incubated overnight with Endo H, as suggested by the manufacturer. Cells (0.5 × 106) were stained as previously described (25Paduraru C. Spiridon L. Yuan W. Bricard G. Valencia X. Porcelli S.A. Illarionov P.A. Besra G.S. Petrescu S.M. Petrescu A.J. Cresswell P. J.

MEF cells transfected with CD1d were incubated with α-GalCer for 4 h or GalGalCer overnight. After three washes in PBS, the cells were fixed in 0.05% glutaraldehyde for 30 s, quenched with an equal volume of 0.4 m glycine and washed in medium three times. The fixed cells (1 × 105 cells/well) were then plated in triplicate in 96-well plates and co-cultured with 1 × 105 DN32.D3 cells/well for 24 h. Secreted mIL-2 was detected by an Opti-ELISA kit from BD Pharmingen following the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were lysed on ice in bicine buffer (0.13 m NaCl, 0.02 m Bicine, pH 8.2) containing 1% Triton X-100, 200 μg/ml dithiobis (succinimydyl propionate) (DSP) (Thermo Scientific), and the proteinase inhibitor mixture. Lysates were quenched with 10 mm glycine before immunoprecipitation. Cells growing on cover slips were fixed at room temperature for 15 min in 3% formaldehyde, quenched with 10 mm glycine for 10 min and permeabilized in PBS containing 0.5% saponin (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.5% BSA. For co-staining, cells were incubated with D5 mouse mAb and rat anti-Lamp1 mAb, followed by Alexa Fluor 546-conjugated highly cross-absorbed goat anti-mouse IgG and Alexa Fluor 633-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG antibodies (Molecular Probes). All images were acquired by using a Leica TCS SP2 confocal system and processed with Leica software. To investigate the role of CRT in the assembly of CD1d molecules, we used the CRT-sufficient MEF cell line K41 and its CRT-deficient counterpart K42. Because MEF cells have no detectable CD1d expression (20Kang S.J. Cresswell P. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), we retrovirally transduced a CD1d-IRES-GFP construct into K41 and K42 cells to generate the stable transfectants K41.CD1d and K42.CD1d. The internal ribosome entry site (IRES) from encephalomyocarditis virus (ECMV) between the CD1d- and GFP-coding regions permitted both genes to be translated from a single bicistronic mRNA. We used flow cytometry to sort stably transduced cell populations that expressed similar levels of GFP, assessed by Western blotting (Fig. 1, A and B) or flow cytometry (Fig. 4A). As expected, this resulted in equal rates of CD1d protein synthesis in both transfected cell lines as determined by a short metabolic labeling experiment (Fig. 1C). However, when steady state protein levels were assessed by Western blot, CD1d levels were found to be substantially higher in the absence of CRT (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 2 and 4, and Fig. 1B). Quantitative Western blotting showed that steady state protein levels of CD1d in CRT-deficient K42.CD1d cells are ∼2-fold higher than in CRT-sufficient K41.CD1d cells. In contrast, levels of GFP and GAPDH, two non-glycoproteins, were indistinguishable in the two cell lines (Fig. 1, A and B). To confirm that the elevated CD1d level was caused by the absence of CRT, we reconstituted CRT expression in K42.CD1d, generating the cell line K42.CD1d.CRT. Introduction of CRT caused a significant decrease in CD1d steady state protein levels (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 4 and 5 and Fig. 1B), whereas levels of GFP and GAPDH remained unaffected. The CD1d level in K42.CD1d.CRT still remained somewhat above that in K41.CD1d, which may be because of the ∼2-fold higher CRT expression in the latter (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 2 and 5 and Fig. 1B).FIGURE 4Absence of CRT promotes elevated levels of functional surface CD1d. A, surface expression of β2m-associated CD1d dimers on K41.CD1d, K42.CD1d and K42.CD1d.CRT cells was examined by flow cytometry using the CD1d51 antibody (unfilled histograms, middle panel).

Background staining was analyzed by incubating parental CD1d-negative MEFs with CD1d51 antibody (filled histograms, left and middle panels).

After washing and fixing, the cells were co-cultured with the mouse NKT hybridoma, DN32.D3, in triplicate. Secretion of mIL-2 into the medium was analyzed after 24 h by sandwich ELISA. Results were expressed as the mean ± S.E. of triplicate values.

Consistent with this, treatment of whole cell lysates with peptide-N-glycosidase F (PNGase F), which cleaves N-linked oligosaccharides from glycoproteins, gave rise to a single CD1d band with a substantially lower apparent molecular weight (Fig. 2A). CD1d has four N-linked glycosylation sites, one of which, at position Asn-42, fails to be processed to the complex form in the Golgi apparatus because of its proximity to the associated β2m (25Paduraru C. Spiridon L. Yuan W. Bricard G. Valencia X. Porcelli S.A. Illarionov P.A. Besra G.S. Petrescu S.M. Petrescu A.J. Cresswell P. J. Biol.

When detergent lysates were treated with Endo H, subjected to SDS-PAGE and blotted for CD1d, two major bands were observed, which represent the partially Endo H-resistant post-ER CD1d and the Endo H-sensitive ER-localized CD1d (Fig. 2A). In K41.CD1d cells the Endo H-sensitive ER form of CD1d was present at a substantially higher level, whereas K42.CD1d cells contained more partially Endo H-resistant post-ER forms (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 2 and 5). The data indicate that in the absence of CRT ER retention of CD1d is lower despite the higher steady state level. We previously observed that the interaction of CD1d free heavy chains with CRT and CNX is glycosylation-dependent (15Kang S.J. Cresswell P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44838-44844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2026842257,"The enzyme Qβ replicase is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which plays a central role in infection by the simple single-stranded RNA virus bacteriophage Qβ. This enzyme has been used in a number of applications because of its unique activity in amplifying RNA from an RNA template. Determination of the thermal stability of Qβ replicase is important to gain an understanding of its function and potential applications, but data reported to date have been contradictory. Here, we provide evidence that these previous inconsistencies were due to the heterogeneous forms of the replicase with different stabilities. We purified two forms of replicase expressed in Escherichia coli, which differed in their thermal stability but showed identical RNA replication activity. Furthermore, we found that the replicase undergoes conversion between these forms due to oxidation, and the Cys-533 residue in the catalytic β subunit and Cys-82 residue in the EF-Tu subunit of the replicase are essential prerequisites for this conversion to occur. These results strongly suggest that the thermal stable replicase contains the intersubunit disulfide bond between these cysteines. The established strategies for isolating and purifying a thermally stable replicase should increase the usefulness of Qβ replicase in various applications, and the data regarding thermal stability obtained in this study may yield insight into the precise mechanism of infection by bacteriophage Qβ."
https://openalex.org/W2031422313,"Both the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as indomethacin, and infection with Helicobacter pylori are major causes of gastric ulcers. Although some clinical studies suggest that infection with H. pylori increases the risk of developing NSAID-induced gastric lesions, the molecular mechanism governing this effect is unknown. We recently found that in cultured gastric cells, expression of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperones (such as 150-kDa oxygen-regulated protein (ORP150) and glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78)) is induced by NSAIDs and confers protection against NSAID-induced apoptosis, which is important in the development of NSAID-induced gastric lesions. In this study we have found that co-culture of gastric cells with H. pylori suppresses the expression of ER chaperones. This suppression was regulated at the level of transcription and accompanied by a reduction in the level of activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), one of the transcription factors for ER chaperone genes. In vivo, inoculation of mice with H. pylori suppressed the expression of ER chaperones at gastric mucosa both with and without administration of indomethacin. Inoculation with H. pylori also stimulated formation of indomethacin-induced gastric lesions and mucosal cell death. In addition, we found that heterozygous ORP150-deficient mice are sensitive to the development of indomethacin-induced gastric lesions and mucosal cell death. The results of this study suggest that H. pylori exacerbates NSAID-induced gastric lesions through suppression of expression of ER chaperones, which stimulates NSAID-induced mucosal cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2026237974,"Msc1, a member of the Jarid1 family of putative histone demethylases, is required for chromosome stability in fission yeast. Msc1 associates with the Swr1 complex that facilitates deposition of histone H2A.Z into chromatin. To assess the function of Msc1 in the Swr1 complex, domains of Msc1 necessary for interaction with Swr1 were identified. The C-terminal plant homeodomain (PHD) 2 and PHD3 of Msc1 are sufficient to confer association with Swr1 and allow Msc1 to function in the context of kinetochore mutants. On the other hand, a mutant with a single amino acid substitution in PHD2 within the full-length Msc1 protein retains the ability to bind to Swr1 but eliminates the function of Msc1 in combination with kinetochore mutants. Thus, Swr1 association is critical but not sufficient for Msc1 function. An activity of Msc1 that depends on the cysteine residue within PHD2 of Msc1 is likewise critical for function. On the basis of our observation that the PHDs of Msc1 act as E3 ubiquitin ligases and that mutations of cysteine residues within those domains abolish ligase activity, we speculate that the ability of Msc1 to facilitate ubiquitin transfer is critical for the function it mediates through its association with Swr1."
https://openalex.org/W2066314316,"Activation of the small GTP-binding protein Arf1, a major regulator of cellular traffic, follows an ordered sequence of structural events, which have been pictured by crystallographic snapshots. Combined with biochemical analysis, these data lead to a model of Arf1 activation, in which opening of its N-terminal helix first translocates Arf1-GDP to membranes, where it is then secured by a register shift of the interswitch β-strands, before GDP is eventually exchanged for GTP. However, how Arf1 rearranges its central β-sheet, an event that involves the loss and re-formation of H-bonds deep within the protein core, is not explained by available structural data. Here, we used Δ17Arf1, in which the N-terminal helix has been deleted, to address this issue by NMR structural and dynamics analysis. We first completed the assignment of Δ17Arf1 bound to GDP, GTP, and GTPγS and established that NMR data are fully consistent with the crystal structures of Arf1-GDP and Δ17Arf1-GTP. Our assignments allowed us to analyze the kinetics of both protein conformational transitions and nucleotide exchange by real-time NMR. Analysis of the dynamics over a very large range of timescale by 15N relaxation, CPMG relaxation dispersion and H/D exchange reveals that while Δ17Arf1-GTP and full-length Arf1-GDP dynamics is restricted to localized fast motions, Δ17Arf1-GDP features unique intermediate and slow motions in the interswitch region. Altogether, the NMR data bring insight into how that membrane-bound Arf1-GDP, which is mimicked by the truncation of the N-terminal helix, acquires internal motions that enable the toggle of the interswitch.

In this work, we investigate the relationship between structure and dynamics of Arf GTPases, which are central regulators of most aspects of intracellular traffic and its cross-talk to cytoskeleton dynamics (reviewed in Ref. 13D'Souza-Schorey C. Chavrier P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). The GDP/GTP switch of Arf proteins represents an extreme case in the GTPase kingdom, characterized by a specific structural device that allows nucleotide exchange to be coupled to membrane recruitment (reviewed in Ref. 14Pasqualato S. Renault L. Cherfils J. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 1035-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). This device is comprised of the classical switch 1 and switch 2 found in all GTPases and two regions that are unique to Arf proteins: an amphipathic, myristoylated N-terminal helix, and 2 β-strands that connect switch 1 to switch 2 (the interswitch) (Fig. 1A). The sequence of conformational changes that take place in the course of Arf activation have been captured by crystallographic snapshots of Arf1, the major eukaryotic isoform, either alone or in complex with GEFs. Structural and biochemical studies have been integrated into a robust model for GEF-stimulated Arf1 activation in cells as follows: (i) the N-terminal helix of Arf1-GDP blocks the interswitch in an eclipsed conformation, which is not competent for binding to membranes (15Amor J.C.

A structural model of human Δ17Arf1-GDP was established by refining the crystal structure of Arf1-GDP against residual dipolar couplings (RDCs), which departed considerably from the available crystal structures (24Seidel 3rd, R.D.

Chem. 2004; 279: 48307-48318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), while the NMR structure of myristoylated yeast Arf1-GDP was much closer to the crystal structures (17Liu Y.

However, none of these studies investigated the contribution of dynamics to the activation process. In this work, we used NMR spectroscopy to analyze spontaneous nucleotide exchange in real time and determine the internal dynamics of Arf1-GDP, Δ17Arf1-GDP, and Δ17Arf1-GTP. Our results, combined with the biochemical and structural data, bring new insight in the interswitch toggle mechanism. Uniformly 15N, (15N, 13C) and (13C, 15N, 2H) labeled human Arf1 or Δ17Arf1 were produced in Escherichia coli in M9 minimal media in milliQ water or heavy water supplemented with 15NH4Cl and [12C/13C] glucose. Arf1 constructs and unlabeled human ARNO (Sec7 domain) were purified to homogeneity as described in Ref. 19Renault L. Guibert B. Cherfils J. Nature. 2003; 426: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar. All NMR experiments were done in 50 mm HEPES pH 7.3, 5% D2O, 150 mm NaCl. The percentage of isotope-labeling was [U-100% 15N], [U-98% 13C; U-98% 15N], and [U-98% 13C; U-98% 15N; U-70% 2H) as checked by mass spectrometry. Δ17Arf1 was purified as a mixture of GDP- and GTP-bound forms, and was loaded with either GDP, GTP, or GTPγS by heating the protein samples (100–600 μm) at 310 K during 30 min in the presence of 10 mm Mg2+ and 10 mm nucleotide. Full-length Arf1 was purified as a GDP-bound form. NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker 600 MHz, 700 MHz, 800 MHz, 900 MHz, or 950 MHz Avance spectrometers equipped with a triple resonance triple axes gradient TXI probe for the 700 MHz and triple resonance z axis gradient TXI cryoprobes for the others. One-dimensional 1H and 31P experiments were recorded on a 500 MHz Varian Inova spectrometer equipped with a penta-probe. Backbone resonance assignments were done at 298 K using triple resonance experiments (HNCA, HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NH with TROSY versions for deuterated samples). Complete assignments could not be achieved from deuterated samples alone due to a lack of proton back-exchange, and requested the combination of data obtained on protonated and deuterated proteins. 1H chemical shifts were referenced to DSS, indirect referencing was used for 15N and 13C chemical shifts. Direct assignment of Δ17Arf1-GTP was not possible because of the hydrolysis of GTP in the course of the spectra recording, yielding a mixture of Δ17Arf1-GDP and Δ17Arf1-GTP resonances. (15N, 13C, 1H) assignments of Δ17Arf1-GDP and Δ17Arf1-GTPγS were thus carried out first, from which the (1H,15N) backbone assignments of Δ17Arf1-GTP could be deduced. Data were processed using NMRpipe (26Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11529) Google Scholar) and analyzed with Sparky (T. D. Goddard and D. G. Kneller, SPARKY 3, University of California, San Francisco). Secondary structures were predicted from the C′, CA, CB, N, and HN chemical shifts by TALOS (27Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2738) Google Scholar). Normalized chemical shifts variations between forms A and B were computed from 15N and 1HN chemical shifts according to Equation 1.ΔδAB,normalized=[δ( 15NA)-δ( 15NB)10]2+[δ( 1HAN)-δ( 1HBN)]2(Eq. 1) Amide protons in close proximity were identified from three-dimensional (1H,15N,1H) NOESY-HSQC experiments recorded at 800 and 900 MHz on both protonated and deuterated samples using two mixing times of 80 and 120 ms. All experiments were done at a protein concentration of 100 μm. GTPγS (20-fold excess) was added at the beginning of each experiment. The purity of the GTPγS stock solution (10 mm) was assessed from 31P one-dimensional spectra. No 31P signal other than the three characteristic peaks of GTPγS was detected after 6 h of accumulation, thus demonstrating purity higher than 95% (supplemental Fig. S6). Series of one-dimensional 1H spectra were recorded at 500 MHz until complete nucleotide exchange. 100 successive (1H,15N) HSQC experiments lasting 16 min each were recorded at 800 MHz until complete nucleotide exchange. The temperature (298 K) was calibrated for each spectrometer using the 100% methanol standard Bruker temperature calibration sample. The decrease of peak intensities as a function of time was fitted to a monoexponential function using either Kaleidagraph (one-dimensional experiments) or MATLAB (HSQC). Uncertainties were estimated from 500 simulated data sets using a Monte-Carlo procedure. A unique protein preparation was split in two identical samples for the one- and two-dimensional experiments. One peak corresponding to the amide proton of Leu-25 in the Δ17Arf1GDP form was isolated in the one-dimensional spectra, so that its intensity decrease upon GTPγS exchange could be monitored in both one- and two-dimensional series. This peak was thus used as a reference to check the consistency between the one- and two-dimensional real time experiments. Identical half times were obtained from the analysis of the one-dimensional peak and the two-dimensional cross-peak of Leu-25. 15N R1, 15N R2, and (1H→15N) nOe experiments were recorded at 700 MHz. 10 relaxation delays were measured between 30 and 3000 ms for 15N R1 and between 0 and 256 ms for 15N R2, with one delay repeated 3 times for error evaluation. Either pseudo-three-dimensional experiments or series of two-dimensional experiments were used. In the pseudo-three-dimensional experiments, the relaxation delay pseudo third dimension was built the fastest and was incremented after each scan. The use of this strategy for Δ17Arf1-GTP minimized the contribution of the GDP-bound form signal arising from GTP hydrolysis. For heteronuclear (1H→15N) nOe experiments, interleaved saturated and unsaturated experiments were acquired. The delay for proton saturation was set to 4 s. All data were processed with nmrPipe (26Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11529) Google Scholar), intensities were calculated with nmrView (One Moon Scientific Inc). R1 and R2 relaxation rates were determined by fitting peak intensities to a single-exponential decay using house-written MATLAB procedures. Uncertainties were estimated as above. The (1HN→15N) nOe values were taken as the ratio between the intensities of corresponding peaks in the spectra recorded with and without saturation of the amide protons. A model-free analysis of relaxation data were performed with the software TENSOR 2 (28Dosset P. Hus J.C. Blackledge M. Marion D. J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 16: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Spectra were recorded at 700 MHz and 950 MHz at 298K using a pseudo-three-dimensional (interleaved) constant time CPMG sequence optimized as described by Hansen et al. (29Hansen D.F. Vallurupalli P. Kay L.E. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2008; 112: 5898-5904Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 30Loria J.P. Rance M. Palmer A.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 2331-2332Crossref Scopus (564) Google Scholar). The CPMG delay (TCPMG) was set to 20 ms. 15–17 experiments were acquired with 15N 180° pulses repetition frequencies (νCP) between 25 and 1000 Hz during TCPMG. Peak intensities were converted to relaxation rates, and uncertainties in relaxation rates were calculated from repeated experiments as described in Ref. 31van Tilborg P.J. Mulder F.A. de Backer M.M. Nair M. van Heerde E.C. Folkers G. van der Saag P.T. Karimi-Nejad Y. Boelens R. Kaptein R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1951-1956Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar. The dispersion curves at the two fields were fitted simultaneously to a global two-state fast exchange (Meiboom equation) using house written MATLAB procedures. Uncertainties were estimated from 1000 simulated data sets using a Monte-Carlo procedure. All U-[15N] protein samples were lyophilized and dissolved in D2O immediately prior to the (1H,15N) HSQC experiments. Experiments were carried out at 298K at 700 MHz (Arf1-GDP) or 600 MHz (Δ17Arf1-GDP). The first spectrum was completed ∼20 min after dissolving the protein in D2O. Series of (1H-15N) HSQC spectra were recorded over 48 h. Data were analyzed using similar procedures as those described for relaxation experiments. Protection factors were obtained as the ratio between the experimentally derived exchange rate constants kex and the intrinsic exchange rate constants kint calculated with the Sphere software. To enable the real-time and dynamics NMR analysis of Arf1 activation on a sound basis, we established the assignment of human Δ17Arf1 bound to GDP, GTP, and GTPγS (supplemental Fig. S1). We first re-assessed the 1H, 15N, and 13C assignments of Δ17Arf1-GDP, which confirmed and completed the corrections, published by Viaud et al. (32Viaud J. Zeghouf M. Barelli H. Zeeh J.C. Padilla A. Guibert B. Chardin P. Royer C.A. Cherfils J. Chavanieu A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 10370-10375Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and assigned the three-dimensional spectrum of Δ17Arf1 bound to the non-hydrolyzable GTP analog GTPγS (supplemental Tables S1 and S2). We obtained high quality spectra for Δ17Arf1-GTPγS that showed no indication of hydrolysis over time, from which most backbone resonances could be assigned. Δ17Arf1-GDP and Δ17Arf1-GTPγS assignments were eventually used to assign the (1H,15N) resonances of Δ17Arf1-GTP from mixed Δ17Arf1-GDP/Δ17Arf1-GTP HSQC spectra. GTPγS induced only 3 significant perturbations as compared with the Δ17Arf1-GTP spectrum, which were located in the vicinity of the GTPγS sulfur (supplemental Fig. S1B). This indicates that GTPγS does not induce notable conformational changes, in agreement with 31P NMR spectroscopy comparison of Ras bound to GTP and GTP analogs, which identified GTPγS as the analog that is most similar to physiological GTP (33Spoerner M. Nuehs A. Herrmann C. Steiner G. Kalbitzer H.R. FEBS J. 2007; 274: 1419-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Next, we assessed the consistency between NMR data and structural models obtained from either crystallographic analysis of full-length Arf1-GDP (PDB entry 1HUR, Arf1-GDPXtal hereafter (15Amor J.C. Harrison D.H. Kahn R.A. Ringe D. Nature. 1994; 372: 704-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 23Amor J.C. Seidel 3rd, R.D. Tian F. Kahn R.A. Prestegar J.H. J. Biomol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 48307-48318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar)), the latter being considerably distorted with respect to known structures of Arf and other GTPases. To that purpose we analyzed normalized chemical shift variations between the different forms (CSVs), chemical shifts based secondary structure predictions, and non-sequential HN-HN nOe correlations with respect to each structural model. CSVs between Δ17Arf1-GDP and Arf1-GDP are located mainly in switch 1, interswitch and in the C-terminal helix, while none are found in the nucleotide-binding site, at odds with its distorted conformation in Δ17Arf1-GDPRDC. Their moderate values (<0.6 ppm) are indicative of at most local and minor conformational differences (supplemental Fig. S2A). By comparison, CSVs between Δ17Arf1-GDP and Δ17Arf1-GTP amount to up to 2.5 ppm (supplemental Fig. S2B). Interestingly, chemical shifts back-calculated for Arf1-GDP using Arf1-GDPXtal and for Δ17Arf1-GDP using Arf1-GDPXtal truncated of the N-terminal helix correctly predicted the location of sizeable experimental CSVs (34Shen Y. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 2007; 38: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), indicating that the deletion of the N-terminal helix is sufficient to yield the observed CSVs locations without major conformational changes (supplemental Fig. S3). Consistently, secondary structures predicted from the experimental chemical shifts match the secondary structures measured from Arf1-GDPXtal significantly better than those calculated from Δ17Arf1-GDPRDC (100 and 80% of α-helices, 80 and 45% of β-sheets, respectively). Finally, 135 1HN-1HN nOes were extracted from the three-dimensional (1H-15N-1HN) NOESY-HSQC spectra of Δ17Arf1-GDP. All the corresponding HN-HN distances calculated from Arf1-GDPXtal were shorter than 5 Å, whereas 44 exceeded 5 Å in Δ17Arf1-GDPRDC, out of which 11 were larger by up to 4.8 Å (Fig. 1B). We also assessed that the crystal structure of the Δ17Arf1-GTP (22Shiba T. Kawasaki M. Takatsu H. Nogi T. Matsugaki N. Igarashi N. Suzuki M. Kato R. Nakayama K. Wakatsuki S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 386-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) was consistent with the NMR data, including HN-HN distances calculated from nOe correlations for Δ17Arf1-GTPγS. Altogether, this analysis establishes that the deletion of the N-terminal helix in Arf1-GDP does not alter its major conformation in solution, and that the crystal structures of Arf1-GDP and Δ17Arf1-GTP, but not Δ17Arf1-GDPRDC, are sensible three-dimensional models with which to analyze the structure and dynamics of the GDP/GTP cycle of Δ17Arf1 in solution. The HSQC spectra of Δ17Arf1-GDP and Δ17Arf1-GTPγS and those of Δ17Arf1-GTP and Δ17Arf1-GTPγS have 29 and 3 non-overlapping crosspeaks, respectively. The nucleotide exchange process can thus be followed in the same sample from the relative intensities of each set of crosspeaks (Fig. 2A). We also used the fact that Δ17Arf1 is purified from E. coli bound to 15N-labeled nucleotides yielding a mixture of GTP- and GDP-bound forms from which nucleotide dissociation upon addition of unlabeled GTPγS can be followed in one-dimensional proton spectra (Fig. 2B). 1H one-dimensional and (1H,15N) two-dimensional spectra were collected over time after addition of 20-fold excess GTPγS until complete exchange of GDP- and GTP- for GTPγS (Fig. 2, A and B). We could therefore monitor simultaneously the kinetics of GDP and GTP dissociation (koff_GDP and koff_GTP, Fig. 2, B and C) and of Δ17Arf1-GDP/GTP environmental changes (k1_GDP and k1_GTP). koff_GDP and koff_GTP indicate that GTPγS replaces GDP slightly faster (koff_GDP = 0.30 ± 0.03 h−1) than it does for GTP (koff_GTP = 0.12 ± 0.02 h−1). The half times of decay for (1HN,15N) peaks of Δ17Arf1GDP were similar for most residues (Fig. 2D and supplemental Fig. S4), indicating a global process with k1_GDP = 0.15 ± 0.02 h−1. A slightly smaller k1_GTP value of 0.057 ± 0.002 h−1 was obtained from the subset of GTP-associated crosspeaks that vary upon GTPγS exchange. Surprisingly, the rates of environmental changes k1_GDP and k1_GTP were about twice smaller than the off rates of nucleotides. The relevance of this difference is assessed by the measurement of an identical decrease rate of the amide proton one-dimensional peak and two-dimensional (1H,15N) crosspeak of Leu-25 in the GDP state (Fig. 2C). We then analyzed nucleotide exchange stimulated by the Sec7 catalytic domain of the GEF ARNO. In the case of Δ17Arf1, addition of 1% molar equivalent of ARNO made the kinetics of the nucleotide exchange too fast to be monitored even by one-dimensional 1H experiments. In contrast, the (1H-15N) HSQC protein chemical shifts of full-length Arf1-GDP were unaffected by the addition of GTP or GTPγS, regardless of the presence of ARNO, as expected from previous biochemical work (reviewed in Ref. 35Pasqualato S. Renault L. Cherfils J. The GDP/GTP Cycle of Arf Proteins, Structural and Biochemical Aspects. Kluwer Academic, 2003Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the bound 15N-labeled GDP was however replaced by unlabeled GTPγS in the presence of ARNO, as shown by the disappearance of the 15N doublet and the appearance of a 14N singlet. Contamination of the GTPγS sample was ruled out by 31P spectroscopy. The fact that the additional phosphate of GTPγS is accommodated in the GDP conformation of Arf1 without yielding protein CSVs in the nucleotide binding site suggests that the additional group is expelled from the nucleotide binding site. Globally, these results suggest the presence of intermediates of the spontaneous exchange reaction that are either empty or can accommodate GDP or GTP without significant conformational change. These states could resemble those evidenced by x-ray crystallography of GDP-bound intermediates of Δ17Arf1-GDP bound to ARNO (20Mossessova E. Corpina R.A. Goldberg J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1403-1411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In the case of Arf1-GDP, the presence of ARNO enhances some local plasticity, sufficient to release the nucleotide and accommodate a GTP, but not to produce the conformational switch. Whereas the structural components of the GDP/GTP exchange of Arf1 are now well established, the contribution of internal dynamics has not been investigated. Dynamics can be analyzed over a large range of time scales by 15N relaxation, which reports on fast internal motions in the pico/nanosecond range, CPMG 15N relaxation dispersion (RD) for motions in the micro to millisecond range (reviewed in Ref. 1Palmer 3rd., A.G. Chem. Rev. 2004; 104: 3623-3640Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar), and H/D exchange to analyze internal flexibility in the minutes to hours range (reviewed in Ref. 2Krishna M.M. Hoang L. Lin Y. Englander S.W. Methods. 2004; 34: 51-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). We analyzed Δ17Arf1-GTP, Arf1-GDP, and Δ17Arf1-GDP dynamics by 15N relaxation and CPMG 15N RD and, for Arf1-GDP and Δ17Arf1-GDP by native-state H/D exchange. 15N relaxation rate constants R1, R2, and nOe, 15N CPMG RD and H/D exchange data are given in supplemental Fig. S5 and Tables S3 and S4, respectively. 15N relaxation rate constants could be measured for most residues in all Arf1 forms, except in the switch 2 due to either broad (Δ17Arf1-GDP and Arf1-GDP) or overlapping (Δ17Arf1-GTP) resonances. They were analyzed with a model-free formalism (36Lipari G. Szabo A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 4559-4570Crossref Scopus (1872) Google Scholar). 15N relaxation data indicate that all Arf forms have an isotropic global rotational motion (overall global correlation time τc at 298K for Arf1-GDP, Δ17Arf1-GDP, and Δ17Arf1-GTP equal to 10.87 ± 0.03, 10.30 ± 0.04, and 10.67 ± 0.05 ns, respectively) and behave as globular monomers in solution. Comparison of internal dynamics shows that Δ17Arf1-GTP is the least dynamic form, displaying only highly restricted internal motions. This is apparent from the small number of residues, all of which are located near the switch 2, that have generalized order parameter S2 values smaller than 0.85, intermediate internal correlation times (τi) in the nanosecond range and conformational exchange contributions (Rex) associated to motions in micro-millisecond range (Fig. 3). Consistently, RD curves were flat for most residues, suggesting that the protein backbones have mainly localized motions in the millisecond regime (Fig. 4, right).FIGURE 4Residues exhibiting significant 15N relaxation dispersion are mapped on the structures of Arf1-GDP (left), Δ17Arf1-GDP (middle), and Δ17Arf1-GTP (right).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The dynamics of Arf1-GDP is somewhat more complex. Although most residues have S2 values larger than 0.85, several exhibit internal correlation time τi in the nanosecond range. This is notably the case for the N-terminal helix and switch 1 regions. Rex contributions are predicted for these regions, although they are only moderately predictive of actual millisecond exchange processes considering their rather small values (5 Hz range) (Fig. 3). Accordingly, CPMG RD experiments indicate the existence of motions in the micro/millisecond timescale for only a small number of residues, in particular in the N-terminal helix (Fig. 4, left). Finally, native-state H/D exchange experiments identified amide protons that were exchanged within minutes to hours, and were located across the entire structure (Fig. 6A, top). In particular, all amide protons located in the N-terminal helix and in the switch 1 are solvent-exchanged within minutes, suggesting that these structures are flexible in this form. The dynamics of Δ17Arf1-GDP departed significantly from those of both Δ17Arf1-GTP and Arf1-GDP. While most residues have S2 values larger than 0.85 and only a small number have intermediate internal correlation times τi in the ns range, Rex contributions in the switch regions are significantly larger than those calculated for Arf1-GDP (Fig. 3). In contrast with Arf1-GDP and Δ17Arf1-GTP, a large number of residues exhibit non-flat CPMG RD curves, which reveals extensive internal motions in the micro-millisecond time scale. Interestingly, a set of residues exhibiting significant RD was located along the whole β-sheet (Fig. 4, middle panel). The exchange rate constant kex equal to 1530 ± 110 s−1 obtained from the global fit of the data at two fields is compatible with a two-state fast exchange (Fig. 5). This fast exchange regime is corroborated by the quadratic dependence of the exchange contributions Rex with the magnetic field (ratio of Rex at 22.3T and 16.45T equal to 1.84 for all residues). Under this condition, the fitted parameter is Δδapp = [pB(1 − pB)](1/2)Δδ and it is not possible to extract the population of each state and the difference in chemical shifts Δδ between the states for each residue. However, it should be noted that because pB is the same for all residues (global exchange), the relative variations of Δδ between residues along the sequence is independent of the population. The results are given in supplemental Table S3. Native-state H/D exchange experiments identified essentially the same amide proton in slow exchange as in Arf1-GDP, except for a striking decrease of the protection factors in the vicinity of the interswitch region (Fig. 6A, bottom). This decrease of the protection factors in Δ17Arf1-GDP as compared with Arf1-GDP indicates that 8 of the hydrogen bonds that are predicted from the crystal structure are likely to be less stable in Δ17Arf1-GDP (Fig. 6B, right) than in Arf1-GDP (Fig. 6B, left, supplemental Table S4). Notably, all hydrogen bonds between the β-strands of the interswitch (β2-β3), and additional hydrogen bonds between the interswitch and strand β1 or switch 1 are less stable in Δ17Arf1-GDP than in Arf1-GDP. As a conclusion, our results show that buried interswitch residues that are protected in Arf1-GDP become unprotected in Δ17Arf1-GDP. Thus the truncation of the N-terminal helix induces motions that allow H/D exchange to take place deep in the protein, involving the disruption of internal hydrogen bonds (Fig. 7). To establish the first dynamics analysis of an Arf GTPase on a sound basis, we first completed the assignment of human Δ17Arf1 bound to GDP, GTP, and GTPγS, and carefully assessed that available NMR information for Arf1 and Δ17Arf1 was fully consistent with crystallographic three-dimensional data. This ruled out the conclusion of a previous work (24Seidel 3rd, R.D. Amor J.C. Kahn R.A. Prestegard J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48307-48318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), which inferred that the crystal structures were not relevant to the structures in solution. This also shows that RDCs should be used with caution in structure calculations, as they also incorporate internal dynamics contributions, which as we show here are sizable in Δ17Arf1-GDP. NMR relaxation dispersion techniques recently emerged as a powerful approach to analyze the propagation of dynamics across proteins on a per-residue basis in signaling or enzymatic processes (reviewed in Refs. 3Boehr D.D. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Chem. Rev. 2006; 106: 3055-3079Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 4Mittermaier A.K. Kay L.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2009; 34: 601-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Our ensemble of Arf1 assignments allowed us to undertake an extensive analysis of the dynamics profiles of Arf1-GDP, Δ17Arf1-GDP, and Δ17Arf1-GTP in time scales ranging from fast and intermediate to slow motions. Notably, incorporation of native state H/D exchange data allowed us to gain access to motions in the minutes to hours range. Our analysis reveals that Δ17Arf1-GTP and Arf1-GDP dynamics are restricted to fast and local motions, whereas Δ17Arf1-GDP displayed a complex dynamics behavior with components in the fast, intermediate and slow regimes. Consistent with these observations, Δ17Arf1-GDP is thermodynamically less stable than Δ17Arf1-GTP and Arf1-GDP, as reflected by their denaturation temperatures measured by the thermo-fluorescence assay (respectively Tm = 63.4, 68.4, and 73.6 °C). The switch 1 and N-terminal helix of Arf1-GDP displayed however intrinsic dynamics, consistent with the fact that these elements are displaced first in the exchange reaction (18Antonny B. Beraud-Dufour S. Chardin P. Chabre M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4675-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 19Renault L. Guibert B. Cherfils J. Nature. 2003; 426: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 21Goldberg J. Cell. 1998; 95: 237-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). These internal motions may therefore prime Arf1-GDP for the initiating event of the exchange reaction. Δ17Arf1-GDP can be considered as a mimic of membrane-associated Arf1-GDP, in which the truncation of its N-terminal helix is equivalent to the displacement of this helix as it binds to membranes in full-length myristoylated Arf1-GDP. This truncation unlocks the retracted conformation of the interswitch, making Arf1-GDP competent for the subsequent membrane-securing step (19Renault L. Guibert B. Cherfils J. Nature. 2003; 426: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Accordingly, Δ17Arf1-GDP is readily activated by GDP/GTP exchange in solution, whereas full-length Arf1 cannot be activated under these conditions (reviewed in Ref. 35Pasqualato S. Renault L. Cherfils J. The GDP/GTP Cycle of Arf Proteins, Structural and Biochemical Aspects. Kluwer Academic, 2003Google Scholar). However, how Arf1-GDP accommodates the toggle of the interswitch in the core of its central β-sheet while maintaining its folded structure has remained unexplained. The comparative analysis of internal dynamics between Δ17Arf1-GDP, Δ17Arf1-GTP, and Arf1-GDP provides for the first time some insight into this central event of Arf and Arf-related GTPases activation (reviewed in Ref. 14Pasqualato S. Renault L. Cherfils J. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 1035-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Altogether, our combined structural and dynamics NMR analysis of Arf1 provides novel insight into the allosteric propagation of information between the side of Arf1 that faces the membrane, and its opposite face that binds nucleotides and cellular partners. The localization of the millisecond range motions along the β-sheet down to the switch regions and the nucleotide-binding site reveals how the release of the N-terminal helix opens a “front-back” communication path across the protein. This communication path is blocked in the full-length protein. We can thus speculate that the combination of inter-strand motions evidenced by CPMG and H/D exchange experiments in the ms to seconds timescales altogether converge toward the opening of the interswitch domain through a lateral process that involve a melting/dissociation of the central β-strands. Inter-strand motions in the ms range trigger higher amplitude motions in the interswitch and switch 1 domains, that may finally drive the whole conformational change from the GDP- to the GTP-bound states orders of magnitude slowly (21Goldberg J. Cell. 1998; 95: 237-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 22Shiba T. Kawasaki M. Takatsu H. Nogi T. Matsugaki N. Igarashi N. Suzuki M. Kato R. Nakayama K. Wakatsuki S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 386-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The transient formation of more opened states shown through H/D exchange thus possibly favors the stabilization of the GTP form (Fig. 7). Our results indicate how, in membrane-associated Arf1-GDP, the displacement of the N-terminal helix through its membrane anchoring renders Arf1-GDP “softer” in the vicinity of the interswitch, and reveal conformational sub-states in exchange at the millisecond timescale that prime the subsequent toggle of the interswitch. The interswitch may then use these acquired internal motions to toggle without disrupting the overall structure of Arf1.
