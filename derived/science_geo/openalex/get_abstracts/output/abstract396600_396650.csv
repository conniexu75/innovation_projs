Bax activity is counteracted by prosurvival Bcl-2 proteins, but how they inhibit Bax remains controversial because they neither colocalize nor form stable complexes with Bax. We constrained Bax in its native cytosolic conformation within cells using intramolecular disulfide tethers. Bax tethers disrupt interaction with Bcl-xL in detergents and cell-free MOMP activity but unexpectedly induce Bax accumulation on mitochondria. Fluorescence loss in photobleaching (FLIP) reveals constant retrotranslocation of WT Bax, but not tethered Bax, from the mitochondria into the cytoplasm of healthy cells. Bax retrotranslocation depends on prosurvival Bcl-2 family proteins, and inhibition of retrotranslocation correlates with Bax accumulation on the mitochondria. We propose that Bcl-xL inhibits and maintains Bax in the cytosol by constant retrotranslocation of mitochondrial Bax.

Members of the Bcl-2 family can be grouped in prosurvival Bcl-2-like proteins and proapoptotic Bax-like members (Chipuk and Green, 2008Chipuk J.E. Green D.R.

The functions of Bcl-2 family members can be regulated by a diverse group of “BH3-only” proteins that initiate the proapoptotic activities of Bax-like proteins (Chipuk and Green, 2008Chipuk J.E.

Bax resides in the cytoplasm of healthy cells and translocates to the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) upon apoptosis induction (Wolter et al., 1997Wolter K.G. Hsu Y.-T. Smith C.L. Nechushtan A.

Proapoptotic BAX and BAK: a requisite gateway to mitochondrial dysfunction and death.Science. 2001; 292: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (3207) Google Scholar). The three concomitant events that characterize the commitment of a cell to apoptosis, Bax oligomerization, cyt c release, and breakdown of the interconnected mitochondrial network, are tightly linked to the process of Bax translocation. An early “rheostat model” proposed that Bax is restrained by heterodimerization with prosurvival Bcl-2 family proteins (Korsmeyer et al., 1993Korsmeyer S.J. Shutter J.R. Veis D.J. Merry D.E. Oltvai Z.N. Bcl-2/Bax: a rheostat that regulates an anti-oxidant pathway and cell death.Semin. Cancer Biol. 1993; 4: 327-332PubMed Google Scholar). However, this view could not be reconciled with experimental evidence of monomeric Bax residing in the cytoplasm of healthy cells, in contrast to the mitochondrial localization of Bcl-2 on the MOM (Hsu et al., 1997Hsu Y.-T. Wolter K.G. Youle R.J. Cytosol-to-membrane redistribution of Bax and Bcl-X(L) during apoptosis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1997; 94: 3668-3672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar, Hsu and Youle, 1998Hsu Y.T. Youle R.J. Bax in murine thymus is a soluble monomeric protein that displays differential detergent-induced conformations.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10777-10783Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Although interactions between Bax and prosurvival Bcl-2 proteins control Bax activity (Fletcher et al., 2008Fletcher J.I. Meusburger S. Hawkins C.J. Riglar D.T. Lee E.F. Fairlie W.D. Huang D.C.S.

USA. 2008; 105: 18081-18087Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), the question remains: How do prosurvival Bcl-2 proteins regulate Bax from a distance without interacting with Bax in the cytoplasm? In an attempt to resolve the dilemma of Bax regulation by prosurvival Bcl-2 proteins independent of “sequestration,” BH3-only proteins have been suggested to mediate the link between cytosolic Bax and the mitochondrial prosurvival proteins. Some findings indicate that Bax can bind to and be activated by the BH3-only proteins Bim, Puma, or the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family protein tBid (Desagher et al., 1999Desagher S. Osen-Sand A. Nichols A. Eskes R. Montessuit S. Lauper S. Maundrell K. Antonsson B. Martinou J.-C. Bid-induced conformational change of Bax is responsible for mitochondrial cytochrome c release during apoptosis.J.

Accordingly, these Bax “activator” proteins are proposed to be sequestered and neutralized by prosurvival Bcl-2 family members in healthy cells. In response to apoptosis, induction “activator” proteins could be released from prosurvival Bcl-2 family proteins, perhaps by competition with other BH3-only proteins binding to prosurvival Bcl-2 family members, to activate Bax (Kim et al., 2006Kim H. Rafiuddin-Shah M. Tu H.C. Jeffers J.R. Zambetti G.P. Hsieh J.J. Cheng E.H. Hierarchical regulation of mitochondrion-dependent apoptosis by BCL-2 subfamilies.Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 1348-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Cell-free assays show a synergistic effect of tBid or Bim on Bax-mediated membrane permeabilization, suggesting a role of both proteins in direct Bax activation (Kuwana et al., 2005Kuwana T.

Korsmeyer S.J. tBID, a membrane-targeted death ligand, oligomerizes BAK to release cytochrome c.Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2060-2071PubMed Google Scholar). Apoptosis assays with Bid/Bim DKO MEFs and the phenotypes of the corresponding knockout mice show that many apoptosis pathways do not depend on activity of either tBid or Bim (Willis et al., 2007Willis S.N. Fletcher J.I. Kaufmann T. van Delft M.F. Chen L. Czabotar P.E. Ierino H. Lee E.F. Fairlie W.D. Bouillet P. et al.Apoptosis initiated when BH3 ligands engage multiple Bcl-2 homologs, not Bax or Bak.Science. 2007; 315: 856-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar), whereas the analysis of Bid/Bim/Puma TKO cells shows an effect on apoptosis induction by several stimuli (Ren et al., 2010Ren D. Tu H.-C. Kim H. Wang G.X. Bean G.R. Takeuchi O. Jeffers J.R. Zambetti G.P. Hsieh J.J.D. Cheng E.H.Y. BID, BIM, and PUMA are essential for activation of the BAX- and BAK-dependent cell death program.Science. 2010; 330: 1390-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). However, direct binding between Bax and BH3-only proteins in cells is not readily apparent (Walensky et al., 2006Walensky L.D. Pitter K. Morash J. Oh K.J. Barbuto S. Fisher J. Smith E. Verdine G.L. Korsmeyer S.J. A stapled BID BH3 helix directly binds and activates BAX.Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 199-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Further evidence indicates that Bax interacts with prosurvival Bcl-2 proteins and suggests that BH3-only proteins play a role in interfering with the heterodimer formation between Bax and prosurvival Bcl-2 proteins, rather than directly activating Bax (Chen et al., 2005Chen L. Willis S.N. Wei A. Smith B.J. Fletcher J.I. Hinds M.G. Colman P.M. Day C.L. Adams J.M. Huang D.C.

Bax also has been found to undergo major conformational changes to integrate in lipid bilayers where membrane-bound Bax can form stable complexes with either tBid or Bcl-xL (Dlugosz et al., 2006Dlugosz P.J. Billen L.P. Annis M.G. Zhu W. Zhang Z. Lin J. Leber B. Andrews D.W.

However, the models of anti- and proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member interaction fail to explain why during apoptosis inhibition increased Bcl-xL concentrations do not result in an accumulation of Bax on mitochondria in complex with Bcl-xL. We report here a mechanism of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family member inhibition of Bax activation and apoptosis whereby Bax in the cytoplasm of nonapoptotic cells continually binds to mitochondria and retrotranslocates back to the cytoplasm through interaction with Bcl-xL. The activation of Bax involves major changes in its protein conformation that are linked to mitochondrial localization and integration into the MOM. We sought to hinder conformational changes involving α helices 1 and 2 of Bax containing the BH3 motif to analyze their involvement in Bax activity. To constrain Bax in its inactive conformation, we substituted to cysteine residues F30 and L63, which are in close proximity, to form an intramolecular disulfide bond between α helices 1 and 2 (1-2) (Figure 1A and Figure S1A available online). We also changed E44 and P130 to cysteines to constrain the flexible loop between α helices 1 and 2 to the tip of helix 6 (L-6). In addition, the intrinsic cysteine residues C62 and C126 were substituted by serine residues (Bax ΔSH) to avoid interference with the engineered disulfide bonds.Figure S1Bax 1-2/L-6 Forms Stable Disulfide Bonds and Adopts a Native Inactive Fold, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Single amino acid substitutions used in different Bax variants.(B) Thiol trapping of cysteine residues in recombinant WT Bax and Bax 1-2/L-6 that are accessible to modification by mPEG-maleimide (mPEG-MAL, 10 kDa).

We examined whether the disulfide bonds 1-2 and L-6 are formed in Bax expressed in HCT116 Bax/Bak DKO cells by SDS-PAGE and western blot in the absence and presence of β-mercapto-ethanol (BME). Wild-type Bax and the Bax variants C62S, C126S, and C62/126S (ΔSH) migrate similarly with and without BME, whereas Bax variants with one or two engineered disulfide bonds (1-2, L-6, and 1-2/L-6) migrate faster in the absence of BME than WT Bax (Figure 1B). The decreased Stokes radius of the denatured Bax variants in the absence of BME indicates that the engineered disulfide bonds form in Bax within cells. We confirmed the absence of free SH groups in Bax 1-2/L-6 by thiol trapping using a maleimide derivative with a 10 kDa mPEG fusion (mPEG-MAL) while WT Bax becomes modified (Figure S1B). The analysis of Bax variants expressed in HCT116 Bax/Bak DKO cells with mPEG-MAL also showed free SH groups in GFP-Bax WT that are absent in GFP-Bax ΔSH (Figure S1C). Thiol trapping of either GFP-Bax 1-2 or GFP-Bax L-6 shows pools of unmodified but also of modified protein, whereas GFP-Bax 1-2/L-6 remains unaltered, suggesting stabilization of a compact Bax fold by the two disulfide bonds, thereby shielding the disulfides from the reducing environment of the cytosol. The redox potential of the disulfide bonds of this Bax variant was determined to be lower than −370 mV (Figure S1D), consistent with their formation in the cytosol (Schafer and Buettner, 2001Schafer F.Q. Buettner G.R. Redox environment of the cell as viewed through the redox state of the glutathione disulfide/glutathione couple.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 1191-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (3396) Google Scholar). We analyzed the conformation of recombinant Bax 1-2/L-6 by NMR in comparison to WT Bax. NMR chemical shift (δ) is sensitive to molecular conformation. Differences of chemical shifts (Δδ) between WT Bax and Bax 1-2/L-6 can be used as a probe of conformational differences of these two molecules. Noticeable differences in chemical shifts of the backbone amide proton and nitrogen are present but are limited to the regions where mutations were introduced (Figure S1E). The absence of significant differences that are not associated with mutations indicates that the global structure of Bax 1-2/L-6 is essentially the same as that of WT Bax. In addition, nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) is direct evidence of molecular structure, as it reports two protons within 5 Å. The NOE spectra from five tryptophan side chains were unaffected by the substitutions (Figure 1C). Noteworthy, the side chain Hɛ1 of Trp158 located at the loop between α6 and α7 helices showed NOEs to Hα and Hγ2 of Ile19 that is 11 residues away from the F30C mutation site, where both Ile19 and Cys30 are located within the α1 helix. In WT Bax, the same NOEs between Trp158 Hɛ1 and Ile19 Hγ2 and Hα were observed. We also found that the regions of flexibility of Bax 1-2/L-6 are the same as WT Bax, only differing with reduced dynamics at the L-6 disulfide tether (Figure S1F). Thus, the intramolecular tethers stabilize the native and inactive conformation in Bax 1-2/L-6 that is similar to inactive WT Bax (see also Supplemental Results). We tested the influence of stabilizing the inactive conformation of Bax in cells by measuring caspase 3/7 activity. Staurosporine (STS)-induced caspase activity in HCT116 Bax/Bak DKO cells expressing Bax ΔSH is similar to WT Bax-expressing cells (data not shown) and is prevented by Bcl-xL overexpression (Figure 2A ). In parallel to the caspase activity assay in Bax ΔSH-expressing cells, STS induces increased cyt c release and cell death indicated by the release of LDH that is inhibited by Bcl-xL overexpression. Similar activities were obtained in HCT116 Bax KO cells with Bax ΔSH or additional single cysteine substitution of either F30, E44, L63, or P130, showing that the substitutions used in Bax 1-2/L-6 do not interfere with Bax activity without disulfide bond formation (data not shown). In all three assays, Bax 1-2/L-6 lacks STS-inducible activity (Figures 2A–2C). However, in the presence of Bcl-xL (Figure 2B) or in the absence of apoptosis induction (Figures S2A and S2B ), overexpression of Bax 1-2/L-6 induced cyt c release more than overexpression of WT Bax. The ability of recombinant Bax 1-2/L-6 to induce cyt c release was also tested using mitochondria isolated from Bax/Bak DKO MEFs (Figure 2D). In this assay, recombinant WT Bax causes the release of cyt c from isolated mitochondria in the presence of tBid. Recombinant Bax 1-2/L-6 fails to induce cyt c release even in the presence of tBid. Thus, the intramolecular tethers in Bax 1-2/L-6 decrease its activation by BH3-only proteins and regulation by Bcl-xL. Although Bax and Bcl-xL do not interact in the cytoplasm of cells, their interaction can be induced in vitro by detergents (Hsu and Youle, 1997Hsu Y.-T. Youle R.J. Nonionic detergents induce dimerization among members of the Bcl-2 family.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13829-13834Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). We assessed whether constraining Bax with intramolecular tethers interferes with this interaction. Though WT Bax and Bcl-xL interact in the presence of different detergents at concentrations greater than CMC, Bax 1-2/L-6 forms heterodimers with Bcl-xL only in Triton X-100, Triton X114, and dodecyl maltoside (Figure S2C and Supplemental Results). Thus, intramolecular tethers can interfere with detergent-induced Bcl-xL binding.Figure S2Bax Tethers Diminish Hetero- and Homodimer Formation in Detergents, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Spontaneous cyt c release induced by different protein levels of either WT Bax (left) or Bax 1-2/L-6 (right) ± SD dependent on the DNA concentration (50, 100, 200 and 400 ng respectively) used for transfection of HCT116 Bax/Bak DKO cells.(B) Western blot analysis of wt Bax and Bax 1-2/L-6 levels in HCT116 Bax/Bak DKO cells transfected with 50, 100, 200 and 400 ng plasmid DNA per well using rabbit anti-GFP antibody.

Recombinant WT Bax and Bax 1-2/L-6 were incubated with full-length purified recombinant Bcl-xL in the presence of Triton X-100 (lane a), Triton X-114 (lane b), CHAPS (lane c), dodecyl maltoside (lane d), Tween 20 (lane e), W-1 (lane f), sodium deoxycholate (lane g), octyl glucoside (lane h) or NP-40 (lane i) at 2 CMC (upper panels) and ½ CMC (lower panels). WT Bax Bcl-xL interaction in Triton X100 (2x CMC) is shown as control (∗). α-Bcl-xL antibody (rabbit) was used to immunoprecipitate Bcl-xL and Western blot analyses was performed using α-Bcl-xL (2H12) antibody and α-Bax (2D2) antibody. (D) Western blot analysis of WT Bax and Bax 1-2/L-6 migration on a Superdex 200 (10/30) column in the absence and presence of Triton X100, sodium de-oxycholate/deoxy-cholate, NP-40 and CHAPS at 1.5 times CMC using 2D2 antibody. On the right two chromatograms of WT Bax (blue) and Bax 1-2/L-6 (red) are depicted from the migration of both Bax variants in the absence (top) and presence of sodium deoxycholate (bottom). Inactive Bax resides mainly in the cytoplasm. Upon activation, Bax forms foci at the tips and constriction sites of mitochondria that is temporally associated with mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) and cyt c release (Karbowski et al., 2004Karbowski M. Arnoult D. Chen H. Chan D.C. Smith C.L. Youle R.J. Quantitation of mitochondrial dynamics by photolabeling of individual organelles shows that mitochondrial fusion is blocked during the Bax activation phase of apoptosis.J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 493-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Like WT Bax, Bax ΔSH is found predominantly in the cytosol of transfected HCT116 Bax/Bak DKO cells and translocates to mitochondria upon apoptosis stimulation (Figures 3A–3C ). Surprisingly, Bax 1-2/L-6 is not located in the cytosol and smoothly coats the mitochondria in 99% of healthy cells and remains unchanged in the presence of apoptotic stimuli (Figures 3A–3C). Whereas Bcl-xL overexpression prevents the localization of Bax ΔSH to the mitochondria after apoptosis induction, GFP-Bax 1-2/L-6 circumscribes the mitochondria even on Bcl-xL overexpression (Figure S3A and Supplemental Results"
https://openalex.org/W1981922832,"Internal physiological states influence behavioral decisions. We have investigated the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms at the first olfactory synapse for starvation modulation of food-search behavior in Drosophila. We found that a local signal by short neuropeptide F (sNPF) and a global metabolic cue by insulin are integrated at specific odorant receptor neurons (ORNs) to modulate olfactory sensitivity. Results from two-photon calcium imaging show that starvation increases presynaptic activity via intraglomerular sNPF signaling. Expression of sNPF and its receptor (sNPFR1) in Or42b neurons is necessary for starvation-induced food-search behavior. Presynaptic facilitation in Or42b neurons is sufficient to mimic starvation-like behavior in fed flies. Furthermore, starvation elevates the transcription level of sNPFR1 but not that of sNPF, and insulin signaling suppresses sNPFR1 expression. Thus, starvation increases expression of sNPFR1 to change the odor map, resulting in more robust food-search behavior."

https://openalex.org/W2114417755,"RNA interference is a powerful tool for studying gene function, however, the reproducible generation of RNAi transgenic mice remains a significant limitation. By combining optimized fluorescence-coupled miR30-based shRNAs with high efficiency ES cell targeting, we developed a fast, scalable pipeline for the production of shRNA transgenic mice. Using this system, we generated eight tet-regulated shRNA transgenic lines targeting Firefly and Renilla luciferases, Oct4 and tumor suppressors p53, p16(INK4a), p19(ARF) and APC and demonstrate potent gene silencing and GFP-tracked knockdown in a broad range of tissues in vivo. Further, using an shRNA targeting APC, we illustrate how this approach can identify predicted phenotypes and also unknown functions for a well-studied gene. In addition, through regulated gene silencing we validate APC/Wnt and p19(ARF) as potential therapeutic targets in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma and lung adenocarcinoma, respectively. This system provides a cost-effective and scalable platform for the production of RNAi transgenic mice targeting any mammalian gene. PAPERCLIP:"
https://openalex.org/W2069367707,"Since April 2010, a severe outbreak of duck viral infection, with egg drop, feed uptake decline and ovary-oviduct disease, has spread around the major duck-producing regions in China. A new virus, named BYD virus, was isolated in different areas, and a similar disease was reproduced in healthy egg-producing ducks, infecting with the isolated virus. The virus was re-isolated from the affected ducks and replicated well in primary duck embryo fibroblasts and Vero cells, causing the cytopathic effect. The virus was identified as an enveloped positive-stranded RNA virus with a size of approximately 55 nm in diameter. Genomic sequencing of the isolated virus revealed that it is closely related to Tembusu virus (a mosquito-borne Ntaya group flavivirus), with 87–91% nucleotide identity of the partial E (envelope) proteins to that of Tembusu virus and 72% of the entire genome coding sequence with Bagaza virus, the most closely related flavivirus with an entirely sequenced genome. Collectively our systematic studies fulfill Koch's postulates, and therefore, the causative agent of the duck egg drop syndrome occurring in China is a new flavivirus. Flavivirus is an emerging and re-emerging zoonotic pathogen and BYD virus that causes severe egg-drop, could be disastrous for the duck industry. More importantly its public health concerns should also be evaluated, and its epidemiology should be closely watched due to the zoonotic nature of flaviviruses."
https://openalex.org/W2042421692,"Upon DNA damage, ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase triggers multiple events to promote cell survival and facilitate repair. If damage is excessive, ATM stimulates cytokine secretion to alert neighboring cells and apoptosis to eliminate the afflicted cell. ATM augments cell survival by activating nuclear factor (NF)-κB; however, how ATM induces cytokine production and apoptosis remains elusive. Here we uncover a p53-independent mechanism that transmits ATM-driven cytokine and caspase signals upon strong genotoxic damage. Extensive DNA lesions stimulated two sequential NF-κB activation phases, requiring ATM and NEMO/IKK-γ: The first phase induced TNF-α-TNFR1 feedforward signaling, promoting the second phase and driving RIP1 phosphorylation. In turn, RIP1 kinase triggered JNK3/MAPK10-dependent interleukin-8 secretion and FADD-mediated proapoptotic caspase-8 activation. Thus, in the context of excessive DNA damage, ATM employs NEMO and RIP1 kinase through autocrine TNF-α signaling to switch on cytokine production and caspase activation. These results shed light on cell-fate regulation by ATM."

Could this mark a turning point in the “War on Cancer”? Building on years of basic scientific discovery, recent advances in the fields of cancer genetics and medicinal chemistry are now converging to revolutionize the treatment of cancer. Starting with serendipitous observations in rare subsets of cancer, a paradigm shift in clinical research is poised to ensure that new molecular insights are rapidly applied to shape emerging cancer therapies. Could this mark a turning point in the “War on Cancer”? In the past year, a startling series of clinical studies has brought molecularly targeted therapies to the treatment of diverse cancers. An inhibitor that blocks a specific mutant of the serine/threonine kinase B-RAF (V600E-B-RAF) demonstrated dramatic efficacy in treating metastatic melanoma, a cancer that was long thought to be among the most refractory (Flaherty et al., 2010Flaherty K.T. Puzanov I. Kim K.B. Ribas A. McArthur G.A. Sosman J.A. O'Dwyer P.J. Lee R.J. Grippo J.F. Nolop K. Chapman P.B. N. Engl. J. Med. 2010; 363: 809-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (2962) Google Scholar). An inhibitor of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) proved highly effective against a subset of nonsmall cell lung cancers that had been prescreened for an oncogenic EML4-ALK translocation (Kwak et al., 2010Kwak E.L. Bang Y.J. Camidge D.R. Shaw A.T. Solomon B. Maki R.G. Ou S.H. Dezube B.J. Jänne P.A. Costa D.B. et al.N. Engl. J. Med. 2010; 363: 1693-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (3832) Google Scholar). A Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) inhibitor proved beneficial against a form of preleukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, that harbors an activating JAK2 mutation (Verstovsek et al., 2010Verstovsek S. Kantarjian H. Mesa R.A. Pardanani A.D. Cortes-Franco J. Thomas D.A. Estrov Z. Fridman J.S. Bradley E.C. Erickson-Viitanen S. et al.N. Engl. J. Med. 2010; 363: 1117-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). In B cell hematological malignancies, which selectively express the class I phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) δ isoform, a PI3K δ-specific inhibitor has shown remarkable activity in refractory tumors (Furman et al., 2010Furman R.R. Byrd J.C. Flinn I.W. Coutre S.E. Benson Jr., D.M. Brown J.R. Kahl B.S. Wagner-Johnston N.D. Giese N.A. Yu A.S. ASCO Meeting Abstracts. 2010; 28: 3032Google Scholar). Even the immunology front, after years of setbacks, made significant strides when antibodies abrogating anticytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen (CTLA)-4 improved survival in patients with advanced melanoma (O'Day et al., 2010O'Day S. Hodi F.S. McDermott D.F. Weber R.W. Sosman J.A. Haanen J.B. Zhu X. Yellin M.J. Hoos A. Urba W.J. ASCO Meeting Abstracts. 2010; 28: 4Google Scholar). In addition, we anticipate promising results from approaches that combine known treatments, such as using both mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) and PI3K inhibitors to treat cancers with mutations in K-RAS (Engelman et al., 2008Engelman J.A. Chen L. Tan X. Crosby K. Guimaraes A.R. Upadhyay R. Maira M. McNamara K. Perera S.A. Song Y. et al.Nat. Med. 2008; 14: 1351-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar) and combining antibodies and kinase inhibitors to treat breast cancers with the HER2 gene amplified (Baselga et al., 2010Baselga, J., Bradbury, I., Eidtmann, H., Di Cosimo, S., Aura, C., De Azambuja, E., Gomez, H., Dinh, P., Fauria, K., Van Dooren, V., et al. (2010). San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium. Abstract S3-3. Presented December 10, 2010.Google Scholar). Most impressive, however, is the sense that the timeline of translating molecular studies into the clinic is accelerating. For example, it took 6–8 years to demonstrate the efficacy of B-RAF and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors in appropriate clinical studies (Davies et al., 2002Davies H. Bignell G.R.

In contrast, it took just more than 1 year for researchers to demonstrate clinical responses to ALK inhibition in a cohort of genotyped patients, after the initial discovery of the EML4-ALK translocations in a subset of lung cancers (Soda et al., 2007Soda M. Choi Y.L. Enomoto M. Takada S. Yamashita Y. Ishikawa S. Fujiwara S. Watanabe H. Kurashina K.

In this Essay, we explore the important advances in cancer genetics, medicinal chemistry, and clinical strategies contributing to these recent successes and enhanced pace. Then, we discuss the key challenges and objectives for continual success. Clearly, the future of targeted therapies depends upon a detailed understanding of the molecular genetic abnormalities that drive different subsets of cancer, a rich pipeline of promising compounds targeting such lesions, and the appropriate use of companion diagnostics, both to prescreen patients that are likely to respond and to detect early signs of either drug response or acquired resistance. The “War on Cancer,” now 40 years old, has been declared a failure, both in the medical literature (Bailar and Gornik, 1997Bailar III, J.C. Gornik H.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 336: 1569-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar) and in the general press (Leaf, 2004Leaf, C. (2004). Fortune Magazine. March 22 issue, 365076.Google Scholar). In contrast to the marked success of cholesterol-lowering drugs and antihypertensives in reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease, the decline in cancer mortality has been relatively modest. This decrease has been attributed primarily to screening for breast and colon cancer and preventive measures, such as a reduction in smoking and the declining use of postmenopausal estrogen replacement. Could the new forms of cancer treatment provide hope for reduced mortality? And what are the critical components that are required to achieve a sustained impact on the disease? It is perhaps ironic that the bill signed by President Richard M. Nixon in 1971, which was ultimately labeled the War on Cancer, triggered a massive investment in basic science. The research was undertaken with the assumption that unbiased fundamental research would hold the key to unlocking the secrets of cancer cells, and indeed, our current knowledge about cellular biology and molecular genetics owes much to this national investment. Although the anticipated timeline for clinical applications of basic research may have been optimistic, recent successes in targeted therapies are based on the accumulated knowledge generated by years of fundamental research in genetics, signaling, cellular, and molecular biology. In particular, we have learned that the genesis of cancer mirrors the process of mutation and selection underlying our own evolution, and the signals that drive or suppress proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, and quiescence in cancer cells mimic those of normal development. We are finally capable of manipulating these signals in some cancers to achieve a profound initial response in the tumor. However, the acquisition of resistance by cancer cells prompts the need for even greater understanding of cellular mechanisms underlying cancer cells' plasticity and adaptation. Single driving genetic lesions may provide clear therapeutic targets in some cancers, but a more profound understanding of interconnected signaling pathways may be required to tackle the majority of tumors. Early cancer genetic studies focused on inherited cancer syndromes in which a single germline mutation is responsible for cancer susceptibility within a family. Such studies provide clear and compelling evidence for the one lesion, typically in a tumor suppressor gene, that is capable of initiating tumorigenesis, as opposed to a vast number of somatic aberrations accumulating during cancer progression. Directed genotyping studies uncovered additional somatic mutations, chromosome translocations, and loss of heterozygosity patterns, pointing to recurrent (and hence probably significant) lesions in many cancers. Functional studies of introduced oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes in cells and model organisms readily demonstrated the powerful impact of mutating a single gene in triggering malignancy. However, it was the decision to undertake whole-scale sequencing of cancer genomes, first by the Sanger Center and then by US and international consortia, that provided a comprehensive view of somatic mutational landscapes in cancer and potential therapeutic targets. Important successes of genome-scale sequencing included the discovery of highly recurrent and specific mutations in BRAF and PI3K (Davies et al., 2002Davies H. Bignell G.R. Cox C. Stephens P. Edkins S. Clegg S. Teague J. Woffendin H. Garnett M.J. Bottomley W. et al.Nature. 2002; 417: 949-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (8310) Google Scholar, Samuels et al., 2004Samuels Y. Wang Z. Bardelli A. Silliman N. Ptak J. Szabo S. Yan H. Gazdar A. Powell S.M. Riggins G.J. et al.Science. 2004; 304: 554Crossref PubMed Scopus (2924) Google Scholar). However, most mutations identified in such analyses appear to be relatively rare and are not shared across multiple cancers (Beroukhim et al., 2010Beroukhim R. Mermel C.H. Porter D. Wei G. Raychaudhuri S. Donovan J. Barretina J. Boehm J.S. Dobson J. Urashima M. et al.Nature. 2010; 463: 899-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (2696) Google Scholar). Although such mutations may be grouped within large functional pathways, predominant therapeutic targets have yet to emerge for the majority of epithelial cancers, which constitute ∼85% of all cancers. Thus, although large cancer genome sequencing projects are underway for many different cancer types, the identification of promising drug targets may ultimately require detailed biological insights to complement mutational analyses. Given that numerous mutations in human cancers occur at low frequency, it is essential to distinguish the mutations that constitute essential “drivers” of tumorigenesis from those that are “passengers” without functional significance (for more on driver and passenger mutations, see Ashworth et al., 2011Ashworth A. Lord C.J. Reis-Filho J.S. Cell. 2011; 145 (this issue): 30-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar in this issue). Of course, the response of cancers to a targeted inhibitor is ultimately the most compelling evidence for the relevance of a given target. For example, the dramatic clinical response to EGFR inhibitors by patients whose lung cancers harbor an activating EGFR mutation clearly demonstrates that these EGFR mutations are not simply bystanders of mutational load, but rather drivers of malignant proliferation (Lynch et al., 2004Lynch T.J. Bell D.W. Sordella R. Gurubhagavatula S. Okimoto R.A. Brannigan B.W. Harris P.L. Haserlat S.M. Supko J.G. Haluska F.G. et al.N. Engl. J. Med. 2004; 350: 2129-2139Crossref PubMed Scopus (10022) Google Scholar, Paez et al., 2004Paez J.G. Jänne P.A. Lee J.C. Tracy S. Greulich H. Gabriel S. Herman P. Kaye F.J. Lindeman N. Boggon T.J. et al.Science. 2004; 304: 1497-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (8483) Google Scholar). In fact, the EGFR inhibitors trigger massive tumor apoptosis in these lung cancers, suggesting that these cells are “addicted” to the EGFR signaling pathway for survival. The concept of “oncogene addiction” emphasizes the critical role played by the “wiring” of signaling pathways in a cancer cell; specifically, a cancer cell's signaling networks may depend on a single mutationally activated driving pathway that, when disrupted, triggers cell death (in effect, its “Achilles heel”) (Weinstein, 2002Weinstein I.B. Cancer Sci. 2002; 297: 63-64Google Scholar). However, identifying such extraordinary drug targets and translating these into effective therapy is not always straightforward, as illustrated by the development of B-RAF inhibitors against melanoma. The failure of sorafenib, an inhibitor of B-RAF, in clinical trials of metastatic melanoma challenged the validity of V600E-B-RAF as a good drug target until PLX4032, a more potent and specific inhibitor against V600E B-RAF, showed dramatic efficacy (Eisen et al., 2006Eisen T. Ahmad T. Flaherty K.T. Gore M. Kaye S. Marais R. Gibbens I. Hackett S. James M. Schuchter L.M. et al.Br. J. Cancer. 2006; 95: 581-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, Flaherty et al., 2010Flaherty K.T. Puzanov I. Kim K.B. Ribas A. McArthur G.A. Sosman J.A. O'Dwyer P.J. Lee R.J. Grippo J.F. Nolop K. Chapman P.B. N. Engl. J. Med. 2010; 363: 809-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (2962) Google Scholar). It is in this setting that preclinical modeling of oncogene addiction, using large panels of cancer-derived cell lines, is emerging as an effective approach to validating both target and inhibitor. Individual cell lines have limited predictive value. However, when they are studied in large aggregates, they recapitulate much of the genetic heterogeneity of human cancers, as well as their specific hypersensitivity profiles to inhibitors of EGFR, ALK, MET, FGFR, and B-RAF (McDermott et al., 2007McDermott U. Sharma S.V. Dowell L. Greninger P. Montagut C. Lamb J. Archibald H. Raudales R. Tam A. Lee D. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 19936-19941Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Preclinical efforts at target identification and validation have also relied on strategies that suppress gene expression using interference RNA (RNAi), although clinically validated targets have not yet emerged from such genome-wide screens. Instead of matching a single compound against the entire genetic heterogeneity of human cancers, RNAi screens have typically focused on screening the entire kinome against a selected cell type. Important applications of this strategy include: searching for new targets for which RNAi-induced knockdown may reverse acquired resistance to first-line targeted inhibitors, and screens for “synthetic lethality,” in which a target only becomes essential within a specific genetic context (Berns et al., 2004Berns K. Hijmans E.M. Mullenders J. Brummelkamp T.R. Velds A. Heimerikx M. Kerkhoven R.M. Madiredjo M. Nijkamp W. Weigelt B. et al.Nature. 2004; 428: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). For instance, the clinical effectiveness of poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors in breast and ovarian cancers with BRCA gene mutations is attributable to their inhibition of a parallel DNA repair pathway that becomes critical for cell viability only in the setting of BRCA gene inactivation. Finally, both RNAi and drug screens are essential to model effective combinations of agents required to block interdependent cellular pathways implicated in intrinsic and acquired drug resistance. Drug resistance has been attributed to numerous mechanisms, including the appearance of additional or “second site” mutations within drug-binding sites (Kobayashi et al., 2005Kobayashi S. Boggon T.J. Dayaram T. Jänne P.A. Kocher O. Meyerson M. Johnson B.E. Eck M.J. Tenen D.G. Halmos B. N. Engl. J. Med. 2005; 352: 786-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (3493) Google Scholar, Pao et al., 2005Pao W.

To counter all these mechanisms requires an even better understanding of the wiring diagram of cancer cells. The history of targeted cancer therapy is now intricately linked with the success of imatinib (Gleevec) to treat chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). The prototype kinase inhibitor imatinib blocks the ABL kinase, which is activated in the BCR-ABL chimeric fusion. From its first identification as the Philadelphia chromosome (Nowell and Hungerford, 1960Nowell P. Hungerford D. Science. 1960; 132: 1497Google Scholar) to its molecular characterization as the sole genetic driver of CML, BCR-ABL is the perfect drug target (Druker, 2004Druker B.J. Adv. Cancer Res. 2004; 91: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The development of imatinib was the result of a structure-activity relationship-guided optimization of a phenylaminopyrimidine lead compound that was originally identified as an inhibitor of protein kinase C (Capdeville et al., 2002Capdeville R. Buchdunger E. Zimmermann J. Matter A. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2002; 1: 493-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar). Indeed, imatinib's eventual application as a BCR-ABL inhibitor owes much to serendipity, intuition, and the dedication of individual scientists. The success of imatinib resolved numerous concerns about using ATP-mimics as kinase inhibitors. It demonstrated that these inhibitors can compete effectively for binding with the abundant pool of cellular ATP and that they can achieve selectivity despite closely related catalytic pockets in other kinases. In addition, it proved that a class of signaling molecules with broad expression patterns in multiple normal tissues could indeed be successful drug targets, given the exceptional sensitivity of genetically defined subsets of cancer. Imatinib was initially aimed at suppressing PDGFR signaling that is implicated in the proliferation of coronary endothelial cells; its fortuitous “off-target” effects on the ABL and c-KIT kinases launched a revolution in cancer therapy, and its anti-PDGFR effects ultimately found their place in the treatment of rare leukemias with PDGFR-dependent translocations (Druker, 2004Druker B.J. Adv. Cancer Res. 2004; 91: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The admittedly serendipitous saga of imatinib spawned a broad and systematic effort throughout the pharmaceutical industry that is now poised to radically change the essential tools for cancer treatment. Tremendous investment in medicinal chemistry, primarily from the pharmaceutical sector, has resulted in the development of numerous efficient strategies for designing potent and selective kinase inhibitors. For example, PLX4720 was developed by an innovative approach called “fragment-based screening,” in which small molecular fragments with low affinity for V600E B-RAF were identified and then optimized using rational structure-guided drug design (Tsai et al., 2008Tsai J. Lee J.T. Wang W. Zhang J. Cho H. Mamo S. Bremer R. Gillette S. Kong J. Haass N.K. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 3041-3046Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar). In addition, structural biology of kinases has become an integral part of drug optimization, with large-scale initiatives such as the Structural Genomics Consortium providing an increasingly large fraction of new depositions (Marsden and Knapp, 2008Marsden B.D. Knapp S. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2008; 12: 40-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, serendipity still plays a major part in successful drug discovery. For example, crizotinib was originally designed as a c-MET inhibitor, but its fortuitous off-target activity against ALK drove its efficacy in EML4-ALK-dependent lung cancer (Kwak et al., 2010Kwak E.L. Bang Y.J. Camidge D.R. Shaw A.T. Solomon B. Maki R.G. Ou S.H. Dezube B.J. Jänne P.A. Costa D.B. et al.N. Engl. J. Med. 2010; 363: 1693-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (3832) Google Scholar). Significant developmental hurdles still exist for kinase inhibitors, including the high interspecies variation in their toxic side effects and the difficulty in deciphering which of these are on-target versus off-target effects of the inhibitor. Despite their large investment, commercial enterprises have been reluctant to develop inhibitors against kinases that have not already been subject to intense biological investigation. This has resulted in an abundance of drugs against a relatively small number of well-validated targets but a dearth of inhibitors with sufficient selectivity to validate the vast majority of the kinome pharmacologically (Fedorov et al., 2010Fedorov O. Müller S. Knapp S. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2010; 6: 166-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Although there are remarkable examples of how broadly active kinase inhibitors, such as sunitinib, may be well tolerated, recent trends have focused more on inhibition of specific mutant targets. These include targeting the specific B-RAF mutant V600E in melanoma, mutationally activated forms of EGFR in lung cancer, and imatinib-resistant T315I-BCR-ABL in CML (Flaherty et al., 2010Flaherty K.T. Puzanov I. Kim K.B. Ribas A. McArthur G.A. Sosman J.A. O'Dwyer P.J. Lee R.J. Grippo J.F. Nolop K. Chapman P.B. N. Engl. J.

Padera R. et al.Nature. 2009; 462: 1070-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). Although many potential cancer therapies remain in the pool of untargeted kinases, new classes of cancer drugs on the horizon are reaching outside of the kinome to target modulators of protein turnover and folding, phosphatases, chromatin-modifying enzymes, and regulators of cellular metabolism. Transcription factors and adaptor proteins with relatively large interaction surfaces remain a major challenge for drug design. From a biological standpoint, tumor suppressor genes, which commonly sustain loss-of-function mutations in cancer, are only druggable through pathway components that display synthetic lethality. Moreover, the most common villains of cancer cells, mutations in the oncogene K-RAS and the tumor suppressor p53, have remained recalcitrant to direct targeting approaches. Many of these targets will require chemists to invent entirely new classes of compounds or develop novel approaches for modulating their activity. Targeted inhibitors stand to benefit from integrated development within the appropriate biological and genetic contexts. Preclinical screens need to test inhibition of an oncogenic target within the appropriate cancer cells, in which the targeted gene is biologically relevant. When possible, biomarkers that identify the responsive subset of cancers should be selected during early preclinical development, rather than awaiting retrospective analyses of clinical trials. As with cancer cell line studies, animal models used to optimize drug dosing and toxicity profiles are most informative if they recapitulate the genetic context of the relevant subset of human cancer. These approaches mark a departure from classical drug testing paradigms that have typically relied on testing a small number of nonannotated cancer cell lines and xenograft mouse models matched to tissue type, rather than underlying genetic lesion. However, the increasing cost of testing large numbers of new agents that may be highly selective for subsets of cancer necessitates detailed information to match the drug, disease subtype, and biomarker before entry into clinical trials. There is a growing consensus that traditional designs of cancer clinical trial are not well suited to address the current needs of drug development. These clinical trials typically begin with a phase one, in which the maximally tolerated dose of a new drug is defined by increasing dosage in a small number of patients (who have failed standard therapies and are willing to be treated with a new untested compound with uncertain benefits). This is followed by a phase two trial in a larger patient cohort with a specific cancer type (without regard to the cancer's genotype or biomarkers); this phase aims at defining efficacy at the appropriate drug dose. Eventually, if clinical activity has been observed in the phase two trial, a large randomized phase three trial is conducted in which the new drug, either alone or in combination with currently used drugs, is directly compared with the standard regimen. If successful, phase three leads to FDA registration for the new drug. This strategy has resulted in a high failure rate, and even in studies with a positive outcome, the benefits are mostly incremental in nonselected patient populations. Besides time and expense, the underlying premise of such trial designs is not suited to the new world of targeted cancer therapy. In particular, defining the maximal tolerated dose for selective inhibitors in patients whose tumor does not carry biomarkers predictive of response for that inhibitor is far less relevant than preselecting tumors that are likely to respond to the inhibitor and defining the therapeutic index within these relevant cases. Traditional multi-institutional clinical trials have relied on enrolling large numbers of unselected patients, followed by retrospective analysis of tumor markers in a fraction of cases enrolled. Thus, they do not readily lend themselves to detailed pretreatment genotyping and may be underpowered to assess drug effectiveness against rare tumor subsets. Given the early and dramatic responses in genotype-selected cancers, the need and even the ethics of large clinical trials—such as the one randomizing V600E-positive melanoma patients between highly effective PLX4032 and minimally effective cytotoxic chemotherapy—is being vigorously debated. For all of these reasons, a new model is emerging, one with an extended phase one that seeks from the beginning to build upon preclinical information and enrich trial populations for the genetic marker of interest (Figure 1). Changes in both method and expected outcome do not come easily, either for physicians or for pharmaceutical companies. The fragmentation of a market among many subtypes of cancer, each requiring a different treatment, means the end of blockbuster compounds for companies. However, it is worth noting that a highly effective drug such as imatinib, administered daily for many years to patients throughout the world, can still provide major financial returns to its manufacturer. For clinicians, targeted cancer therapy requires breaking down traditional barriers in clinical medicine. Phase one and novel drug testing teams are no longer focused exclusively on patients with advanced refractory disease, irrespective of tumor characteristics. Instead, early drug testing is being integrated into the initial care of patients, with the expressed goal of trying to match the drug under study with specific subsets of cancers, within a timeline that may derive real benefit for patients participating in such trials. Most importantly, the pathologist is now in the critical position of going beyond the standard histopathological diagnosis of cancer, providing the oncologist with the key biomarkers that direct appropriate targeted therapy. In some cases, this may involve prescreening tumors to enable a successful clinical trial. For example, even for a common cancer, such as nonsmall cell lung cancer, genotype-drug combinations require testing a large number of cases to enrich for EGFR mutations (10% of all cases), EML4-ALK rearrangements (4%), or MET, HER2, and B-RAF abnormalities (1%–2% each). In the landmark clinical trial of crizotinib for EML4-ALK-translocated lung cancer, 1500 patients were prescreened to identify 82 cases with the translocation. These patients were then selected for treatment with crizotinib, producing benefit in 90% of cases (57% responses and 33% stable disease) (Kwak et al., 2010Kwak E.L. Bang Y.J. Camidge D.R. Shaw A.T.

https://openalex.org/W1988178943,"Exchange of proteins at sorting endosomes is not only critical to numerous signaling pathways but also to receptor-mediated signaling and to pathogen entry into cells; however, how this process is regulated in synaptic vesicle cycling remains unexplored. In this work, we present evidence that loss of function of a single neuronally expressed GTPase activating protein (GAP), Skywalker (Sky) facilitates endosomal trafficking of synaptic vesicles at Drosophila neuromuscular junction boutons, chiefly by controlling Rab35 GTPase activity. Analyses of genetic interactions with the ESCRT machinery as well as chimeric ubiquitinated synaptic vesicle proteins indicate that endosomal trafficking facilitates the replacement of dysfunctional synaptic vesicle components. Consequently, sky mutants harbor a larger readily releasable pool of synaptic vesicles and show a dramatic increase in basal neurotransmitter release. Thus, the trafficking of vesicles via endosomes uncovered using sky mutants provides an elegant mechanism by which neurons may regulate synaptic vesicle rejuvenation and neurotransmitter release."

Both sporadic and programmed DSBs need careful and prompt repair to maintain genome stability and allow cell survival. DSBs elicit a complex cellular response and induce different repair pathways (Harper and Elledge, 2007Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. The DNA damage response: ten years after.Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 739-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar). Repair proceeds predominantly by homologous recombination (HR), nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), or microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ). In HR, DSBs are repaired error-free using the sister chromatid as template. In NHEJ, DNA ends are directly religated, often at microhomologies after limited, potentially mutagenic, processing of the DNA ends (MMEJ). The central response factor for DSBs is the Mre11:Rad50:Nbs1 (MRN) complex (Mre11:Rad50:Xrs2 [MRX] in Saccharomyces cerevisiae). It is involved in most, if not all, DNA end-associated processes including damage checkpoint signaling, HR, NHEJ/MMEJ, telomere maintenance, and meiotic recombination (Borde, 2007Borde V.

Finally, MRN is implicated in tethering of DNA ends and chromatids via coiled-coil tails of Rad50 (Hopfner et al., 2002Hopfner K.P. Craig L. Moncalian G. Zinkel R.A. Usui T. Owen B.A. Karcher A.

Homologs for Mre11 and Rad50, but not Nbs1, are found in all three phylogenetic domains and are also known as SbcC (Rad50 homolog) and SbcD (Mre11 homolog) in bacteria (Sharples and Leach, 1995Sharples G.J.

MR is a large, bipolar complex containing two Mre11 and two Rad50 polypeptides (Hopfner et al., 2001Hopfner K.P. Karcher A. Craig L. Woo T.T. Carney J.P. Tainer J.A.

The Mre11 dimer and the two Rad50 nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) form a “catalytic head” that harbors ATP-stimulated nuclease and DNA-binding activities. Two long Rad50 coiled-coil domains protrude from this head and can bind other MR complexes via their apical zinc-hook dimerization motifs (de Jager et al., 2001de Jager M. van Noort J. van Gent D.C.

Vitriol E. Stemple J. Resnick M.A. Bloom K. Chromosome fragmentation after induction of a double-strand break is an active process prevented by the RMX repair complex.Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 2107-2112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The functional interplay of Rad50s ATPase and the Mre11 nuclease in DSB repair remained unclear, mostly because there is not a structural framework for the catalytic head complex. As a consequence, the role of Rad50s ATPase function has been unclear, although it is essential for MR(N/X) function (Bhaskara et al., 2007Bhaskara V. Dupre A. Lengsfeld B. Hopkins B.B. Chan A. Lee J.H. Zhang X. Gautier J. Zakian V. Paull T.T. Rad50 adenylate kinase activity regulates DNA tethering by Mre11/Rad50 complexes.Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 647-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Likewise, it is unknown why DSB recognition by MR(N/X) has no clear biochemical preference for DNA ends or hairpins and binds DNA also at internal sites. This is important because MRN can sense and clear protein-bound DNA ends in vitro (Connelly et al., 2003Connelly J.C. de Leau E.S. Leach D.R.

Pan J. Keeney S. Endonucleolytic processing of covalent protein-linked DNA double-strand breaks.Nature. 2005; 436: 1053-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). The remarkable ability to clean up blocked and misfolded ends using an ATP-driven nuclease activity distinguishes MR(N/X) from, e.g., the NHEJ protein Ku (Walker et al., 2001Walker J.R. Corpina R.A. Goldberg J. Structure of the Ku heterodimer bound to DNA and its implications for double-strand break repair.Nature. 2001; 412: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). To provide a structural framework for the complex between Mre11 and Rad50, we determined the X-ray crystal structure of the catalytic head of the Thermotoga maritima MR (SbcCD) complex as well as the crystal structure of the AMPPNP-bound Rad50 NBD dimer in complex with the Rad50-binding helix-loop-helix motif (HLH) of Mre11. We also analyzed ATP-dependent conformational changes of the MR head module by small- angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and chemical crosslinking assays. The structure revealed that Mre11 and Rad50 form a large ATP controlled molecular clamp, suited to recognize even blocked DSBs. The observed interfaces were tested by mutating homologous regions in eukaryotic MRX in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Finally, we demonstrate that ATP binding to Rad50 induces conformational changes in the Mre11 dimer, providing a mechanistic role for Rad50s ATP-binding activity in controlling DNA processing by Mre11. This unifies the functional architecture of MR with other ABC type molecular machines such as ABC transporters. We copurified and crystallized Mre11 from Thermotoga maritima (Tm) and a shortened Rad50 (see Experimental Procedures) that comprises the nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) and approximately 50 amino acids of the Mre11-binding coiled coil (Rad50NBD). The two ends of the shortened coiled coil are fused by a short linker. Both proteins form a stoichiometric complex with ATPase as well as DNA-binding activity (see Figure S1 available online). Crystals of space group I222 contained one full catalytic head (M2:RNBD2) per asymmetric unit and diffracted X-rays to 3.4 Å resolution. Single wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing and density modification produced an interpretable electron density for both Mre11s and one Rad50NBD (Figure 1A ). Electron density for the second Rad50 was less defined, presumably because this domain is more mobile due to lack of additional crystal contacts. However, we could rigid-body dock the model obtained from the well-defined Rad50NBD into the density of the second Rad50NBD using unambiguous anomalous difference density markers and some secondary electron density. Both Rad50NBDs interact with Mre11 in a similar manner.

See also Figure S1 and Table S1. The TmMR catalytic head (TmMRNBD) is an elongated crescent shaped complex with approximately 60 × 70 × 210 Å dimensions (Figures 1A and 1B). Its core is formed by a dimer of the two Mre11 nuclease domains, with the two nuclease-active sites located near the center of the concave face. The Rad50 NBDs each attach to the outside of the nuclease dimer and form the tips of the crescent. The Rad50 coiled coils protrude from the convex side of the catalytic head, opposite to the nuclease-active sites, at an angle of approximately 120° from each other. This architecture fits well the bipolar shapes of full prokaryotic MR and eukaryotic MRN complexes previously visualized by electron and scanning force microscopy (Connelly et al., 1998Connelly J.C. Kirkham L.A. Leach D.R. The SbcCD nuclease of Escherichia coli is a structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) family protein that cleaves hairpin DNA.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The NBDs of Rad50 possess the typical bilobed ABC fold, whereas Mre11 shows an extended structure, composed of two functional modules, the “nuclease module” and the Rad50-binding domain. The nuclease module comprises the phosphodiesterase and accessory DNA-binding “capping” domains. The Rad50-binding domain contains a helix-loop-helix (HLH) domain that binds to the root of Rad50s coiled coil. Surprisingly, the nuclease module and the HLH domain are widely separated and connected by a long, poorly structured linker, that wraps around Rad50s NBD and places the capping and HLH domains of Mre11 on opposite sites of it. A second interaction is formed between Mre11's capping domain and Lobe II of Rad50s NBDs, stabilizing the observed extended domain arrangement between Mre11 and Rad50 in the catalytic head. To verify the domain arrangements found in the crystal structure, we performed small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). The experimentally derived SAXS intensities of MRNBD closely match the scattering intensities calculated from its crystal structure and individual as well as averaged ab initio SAXS models exhibit the elongated shape of the atomic model (Figures 1C and 1D). This supports the conclusion that the MR crystal structure we present here closely resembles the conformation of the complex in solution. The overall structure explains two poorly understood functional characteristics of MR. The widely separated, outward placement of the Rad50 NBDs allows unobstructed access of DNA to the Mre11 active sites, even if DNA ends are blocked by large proteins. In addition, our structure shows that the complex has the potential to undergo major conformational changes, consistent with the observation of large conformational changes identified by scanning force microscopy of human MRN (Moreno-Herrero et al., 2005Moreno-Herrero F. de Jager M. Dekker N.H. Kanaar R. Wyman C. Dekker C. Mesoscale conformational changes in the DNA-repair complex Rad50/Mre11/Nbs1 upon binding DNA.Nature. 2005; 437: 440-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). There are three types of macromolecular interfaces in MRNBD, one between the two Mre11 subunits and two between Mre11 and Rad50 (Figures 2A–2C ). A fourth interface between the two Rad50 NBDs in the presence of ATP will be described below. The two Mre11 phosphodiesterase domains interact by forming a four-helix bundle (αB and αC from both protomers) around central hydrophobic/aromatic residues (F102, F105, and L75 from both protomers) (Figure 2C3). This interface is related to that seen in the crystal structure of the catalytic domain of P. furiosus Mre11, showing that the architectural principles of MR are conserved. Rad50 binds Mre11 with two interfaces (1 and 2) comprising areas of 1334 and 686 Å2, respectively. Interface 1 (Figures 2A–2C) is formed by binding of the Mre11 C-terminal HLH domain to the coiled-coil root of Rad50, with αH and αI of the HLH domain binding perpendicularly across Rad50s coiled coil. αHMre11 binds only one coiled-coil helix (αHRad50), whereas αIMre11 reaches across both coiled-coil helices (αGRad50 and αHRad50). Interestingly, αHMre11 binds to αHRad50 at a pronounced kink and extended loop, located directly opposite the start of αGRad50 at the other side of the coiled coil. Thus, the coiled coil is attached to the NBD not with a continuous helix, but with a structure that may allow for movements between the coiled coil and Mre11-binding site and the globular part of the ATPase. The HLH motif and coiled-coil domains bind to each other via an array of aromatic and hydrophobic residues. αHMre11 and αHRad50 interact through eight aromatic residues (Mre11: Y351, F352, F355, Y358; Rad50: Y707, F714, Y717, F718). The interface is further stabilized mainly by hydrophobic interactions between αIMre11 and αGRad50 but also some specific hydrogen bonds and salt bridges, e.g., between E379Mre11 and K180Rad50 (Figure 2C). The linker preceding αHMre11 and connecting the HLH domain with the nuclease module runs along the outside of the NBD at Lobe II until it reaches the capping domain at the second interface between Rad50 and Mre11. Although parts of the linker adjacent to the HLH domain are ordered and we observe a few, dispersed hydrophobic and ionic contacts to the NBD, some parts appear to be disordered, suggesting that the linker acts as a flexible leash. Interface 2 (Figure 2C) is formed between one face of Mre11's capping domain and the “bottom” side of Rad50s Lobe II (the side opposite the coiled coil). This interface is predominantly polar, although W758Rad50 and I760Rad50 bind a small hydrophobic patch at the core of this interface (F291Mre11), located at the edge of the β sheet of the capping domain, with contributions from the flanking αFMre11. Interestingly, a part of the interface is mediated by the signature motif, which becomes bound by ATP in the engaged conformation of the NBDs. Likewise, the Mre11 capping domain also participates in DNA binding (Williams et al., 2008Williams R.S. Moncalian G. Williams J.S. Yamada Y. Limbo O. Shin D.S. Groocock L.M. Cahill D. Hitomi C. Guenther G. et al.Mre11 dimers coordinate DNA end bridging and nuclease processing in double-strand-break repair.Cell. 2008; 135: 97-109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Consequently, interface 2 could transiently stabilize the “open” conformation with separated NBDs until DNA and/or ATP is bound while also allowing the NBDs mobility for ATP-induced conformational changes (see below). To verify the functional significance of the observed interfaces in vivo, we tested mutants in all three interfaces of Saccharomyces cerevisiae MRX for their ability to complement the methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), hydroxyurea (HU), and camptothecin (CPT) sensitivity of the Δmre11 strain (Figure 2D). Mutations were chosen on the basis of sequence conservation (Figure 2B) or using a structure of S. pombe Mre11 as guide (unpublished data). We also tested a replacement of seven residues of the linker between catalytic and Rad50-binding domains of Mre11 with a TEV protease target sequence (419-425TEV) and a Mre11 truncation variant (P530STOP). All proteins were expressed at normal levels according to western blot analysis (Figure S2). Consistent with previous data, wild-type MRE11 and the mre11-P530STOP (resulting in a protein truncated after the HLH region) confers resistance to MMS, HU, and CPT in the Δmre11 strain (Chamankhah and Xiao, 1999Chamankhah M.

The Mre11 dimer interface mutants (L145R and L68R) can only partially rescue MMS, HU, and CPT sensitivity, similar to what has been observed in the case of S. pombe Rad32 (Williams et al., 2008Williams R.S. Moncalian G. Williams J.S. Yamada Y. Limbo O. Shin D.S. Groocock L.M. Cahill D. Hitomi C.

In addition, we found that F474R, I487R, and I491R in Mre11:Rad50 interface 1 (HLHMre11:coiled coilRad50) do not rescue MMS, HU, and CPT sensitivity. Finally, the Mre11:Rad50 interface 2 (CapMre11:NBDRad50) mutations H320D and Y328A partially or completely fail to rescue MMS, HU, and CPT sensitivity. Previously, it was found that an 11 amino acid deletion mutant of the S. cerevisiae Mre11 at the predicted interface 2 (Mre11-6) also shows MMS sensitivity and DSB processing defects (Usui et al., 1998Usui T.

We hypothesized that PI3K/Akt/GSK-3β signaling pathway could be involved in this apparent age-dependent neuroprotective/neurodegenerative status. In fact, our data demonstrated that, as compared with age-matched nontransgenic controls, the Ser-9 phosphorylation of GSK-3β was increased in the 6-month PS1×APP hippocampus, whereas in aged PS1×APP animals (18 months), GSK-3β phosphorylation levels displayed a marked decrease. Using N2a and primary neuronal cell cultures, we demonstrated that soluble amyloid precursor protein-α (sAPPα), the predominant APP-derived fragment in young PS1×APP mice, acting through IGF-1 and/or insulin receptors, activated the PI3K/Akt pathway, phosphorylated the GSK-3β activity, and in consequence, exerted a neuroprotective action. On the contrary, several oligomeric Aβ forms, present in the soluble fractions of aged PS1×APP mice, inhibited the induced phosphorylation of Akt/GSK-3β and decreased the neuronal survival. Furthermore, synthetic Aβ oligomers blocked the effect mediated by different neurotrophins (NGF, BDNF, insulin, and IGF-1) and sAPPα, displaying high selectivity for NGF. In conclusion, the age-dependent appearance of APP-derived soluble factors modulated the PI3K/Akt/GSK-3β signaling pathway through the major neurotrophin receptors. sAPPα stimulated and Aβ oligomers blocked the prosurvival signaling.

https://openalex.org/W2021579275,"Hybridization plays a central role in plant evolution, but its overall importance in fungi is unknown. New plant pathogens are thought to arise by hybridization between formerly separated fungal species. Evolution of hybrid plant pathogens from non-pathogenic ancestors in the fungal-like protist Phytophthora has been demonstrated, but in fungi, the most important group of plant pathogens, there are few well-characterized examples of hybrids. We focused our attention on the hybrid and plant pathogen Verticillium longisporum, the causal agent of the Verticillium wilt disease in crucifer crops. In order to address questions related to the evolutionary origin of V. longisporum, we used phylogenetic analyses of seven nuclear loci and a dataset of 203 isolates of V. longisporum, V. dahliae and related species. We confirmed that V. longisporum was diploid, and originated three different times, involving four different lineages and three different parental species. All hybrids shared a common parent, species A1, that hybridized respectively with species D1, V. dahliae lineage D2 and V. dahliae lineage D3, to give rise to three different lineages of V. longisporum. Species A1 and species D1 constituted as yet unknown taxa. Verticillium longisporum likely originated recently, as each V. longisporum lineage was genetically homogenous, and comprised species A1 alleles that were identical across lineages."
https://openalex.org/W2036062404,"MHC class II molecules (MHC-II) present peptides to T helper cells to facilitate immune responses and are strongly linked to autoimmune diseases. To unravel processes controlling MHC-II antigen presentation, we performed a genome-wide flow cytometry-based RNAi screen detecting MHC-II expression and peptide loading followed by additional high-throughput assays. All data sets were integrated to answer two fundamental questions: what regulates tissue-specific MHC-II transcription, and what controls MHC-II transport in dendritic cells? MHC-II transcription was controlled by nine regulators acting in feedback networks with higher-order control by signaling pathways, including TGFβ. MHC-II transport was controlled by the GTPase ARL14/ARF7, which recruits the motor myosin 1E via an effector protein ARF7EP. This complex controls movement of MHC-II vesicles along the actin cytoskeleton in human dendritic cells (DCs). These genome-wide systems analyses have thus identified factors and pathways controlling MHC-II transcription and transport, defining targets for manipulation of MHC-II antigen presentation in infection and autoimmunity."
https://openalex.org/W2159773954,"Background The dominant viral etiologies responsible for acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are poorly understood, particularly among hospitalized children in resource-limited tropical countries where morbidity and mortality caused by ARIs are highest. Improved etiological insight is needed to improve clinical management and prevention. Objectives We conducted a three-year prospective descriptive study of severe respiratory illness among children from 2 months to 13 years of age within the largest referral hospital for infectious diseases in southern Vietnam. Methods Molecular detection for 15 viral species and subtypes was performed on three types of respiratory specimens (nose, throat swabs and nasopharyngeal aspirates) using a multiplex RT-PCR kit (Seeplex™ RV detection, Seegene) and additional monoplex real-time RT-PCRs. Results A total of 309 children were enrolled from November 2004 to January 2008. Viruses were identified in 72% (222/309) of cases, including respiratory syncytial virus (24%), influenza virus A and B (17%), human bocavirus (16%), enterovirus (9%), human coronavirus (8%), human metapneumovirus (7%), parainfluenza virus 1–3 (6%), adenovirus (5%), and human rhinovirus A (4%). Co-infections with multiple viruses were detected in 20% (62/309) of patients. When combined, diagnostic yields in nose and throat swabs were similar to nasopharyngeal aspirates. Conclusion Similar to other parts in the world, RSV and influenza were the predominant viral pathogens detected in Vietnamese hospitalized children. Combined nasal and throat swabs are the specimens of choice for sensitive molecular detection of a broad panel of viral agents. Further research is required to better understand the clinical significance of single versus multiple viral coinfections and to address the role of bacterial (co-)infections involved in severe respiratory illness."

The disease is nevertheless pleiotropic and affects a number of other organs and functions (Harper, 2001Harper P.S. Myotonic Dystrophy. Oxford University Press, Oxford2001Google Scholar), specifically the central nervous system (CNS). Cognitive impairment and excessive sleepiness have been clinically identified in DM1 patients (de León and Cisneros, 2008de León M.B. Cisneros B.

Congenital dystrophia myotonica.Neurology. 1973; 23: 465-473Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms underlying the neuropathology in DM1 are mostly unknown. The disease is due to an inherited unstable expansion of CTG triplet repeats located within the 3′-untranslated region of the dystrophia myotonica-protein kinase gene (DMPK). Although defects related to DMPK protein levels may contribute to some of the observed clinical features (Llagostera et al., 2007Llagostera E. Catalucci D. Marti L. Liesa M. Camps M. Ciaraldi T.P.

Electrophysiol. 1999; 10: 1214-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), the current accepted molecular model suggests that most symptoms are associated with trans-dominant alterations of RNA processing (Cooper et al., 2009Cooper T.A.

DMPK transcripts with expanded CUG repeats accumulate in the cell nucleus instead of being exported to the cytoplasm. They form intranuclear inclusions (foci) by aggregating nuclear proteins, some of which are involved in RNA splicing and stabilization such as MBNL1. This sequestration of RNA-processing proteins in foci leads to a decrease in their activity and, consequently, to impaired alternate splicing and abnormal expression of a large number of genes. This translates into a wide spectrum of affected organs and clinical symptoms in DM1 (Cooper et al., 2009Cooper T.A. Wan L. Dreyfuss G.

Our aim was to search for new molecular mechanisms of the DM1 neuropathology by using pluripotent stem cell lines derived from embryos characterized during preimplantation genetic diagnosis as carrying the gene for this disease. These cells can self-renew indefinitely, making them available in large numbers. These were used to perform a whole-genome transcriptomic analysis. Their ability to differentiate into any cell lineage allowed us to perform functional studies to evaluate the development of neuromuscular connections. Based on these complementary approaches, this report describes a neuropathological mechanism for DM1 that links gene defects in neural lineage with a dysfunction in neurite outgrowth and synaptogenesis. Two DM1-affected human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines from independent couples were derived after preimplantation genetic diagnosis, VUB03_DM and VUB24_DM (Mateizel et al., 2006Mateizel I.

Derivation of human embryonic stem cell lines from embryos obtained after IVF and after PGD for monogenic disorders.Hum. Reprod. 2006; 21: 503-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). These lines carry a mutant DMPK gene that contains within the 3′UTR region approximately 1000 and 3000 CTG triplet repeats, respectively (Figure S1 available online). The size of the CTG triplet repeats remains quite stable during culture (Figure S1). Three wild-type hESC lines were used as controls (VUB01, SA001, and H9). There was no alteration of cell growth or differentiation capacity for DM1 cells compared to controls. DMPK mRNA was expressed at similar levels in DM1-affected and control cells (Figure S1). To identify differentially expressed genes associated with DM1 in neural cells, VUB03_DM cells were compared with two wild-type hESC lines (VUB01 and SA001) and the results confirmed with quantitative RT-PCR in VUB24_DM and H9. Cells were either kept undifferentiated (hESC) or were differentiated into neural precursor cells (NPC) (Perrier et al., 2004Perrier A.L. Tabar V. Barberi T. Rubio M.E. Bruses J. Topf N.

A whole-gene expression profiling was performed with Affymetrix whole-genome DNA chips (Figure S1). Principal component analysis showed similar expression profiles between the DM1 and the wild-type cell lines at the same differentiation stage, indicating that the effects of DM1 mutation on gene expression were probably subtle (Figure S1). Observed changes in expression were further confirmed with quantitative real-time RT-PCR for 15 genes in VUB03_DM and VUB24_DM relative to at least one of the three cell types studied (Table 1). These 15 genes, 8 downregulated and 7 upregulated, are involved in a large spectrum of cellular functions ranging from transcription regulation to cell migration.Table 1Gene with Modulations in at Least One of the Three Cell Type PopulationsGene Downregulated in VUB03_DMGene TitleGene SymbolChromosome NumberEntrez GeneUnigeneFold Change hESFold Change NPCFold Change MPCZinc finger protein 37a (KOX 21)ZNF37Achr107587Hs.2925753.7811.8510.71Proteasome (prosome, macropain) 26S subunit, non-ATPase, 5PSMD5chr95711Hs.1937258.343.21Zinc finger protein 248ZNF248chr1057209Hs.2527554.62SLIT and NTRK-like family, member 4SLITRK4chrX139065Hs.27228420.84EPH receptor A5EPHA5chr42044Hs.47985322.36Paired related homeobox 1PRRX1chr15396Hs.2834169.22Nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase domain containing 1NAPRT1chr893100Hs.4931647.72Ribosomal protein L31RPL31chr26160Hs.5185516.17Gene Upregulated in VUB03_DMGene TitleGene SymbolChromosome NumberEntrez GeneUnigeneFold ChangeFold ChangeFold ChangeTrafficking protein particle complex 3TRAPPC3chr127095Hs.5231312.613.20Cathepsin BCTSBchr81508Hs.5208982.093.17Maternally expressed 3MEG3chr1455384Hs.2798158.7990.57NAD(P)H dehydrogenase, quinone 2NQO2chr64835Hs.5330505.163.08Interleukin 13 receptor, alpha 1IL13RA1chrX3597Hs.4966465.41Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2, subunit 3 gamma, 52 kDaEIF2S3chr121968Hs.5396842.57Prickle-like 1 (Drosophila)PRICKLE1chr12144165Hs.5243482.92 Open table in a new tab We focused on SLITRK4 because it is specifically downregulated in DM1 neural precursor cells. The SLITRK family of proteins has been shown to play a role in neurite outgrowth (Aruga and Mikoshiba, 2003Aruga J. Mikoshiba K.

We performed a comparative analysis of neurite outgrowth in DM1 and control neural progenies to identify any potential functional defects. We chose to differentiate DM1 hESCs into motoneurons, because this a potential model of synaptogenesis in coculture with muscle cells. A differentiation protocol, modified from existing ones (Martinat et al., 2006Martinat C. Bacci J.J. Leete T. Kim J. Vanti W.B. Newman A.H. Cha J.H. Gether U. Wang H. Abeliovich A.

Differentiation was analyzed by immunocytochemistry (Figures 1A and 1B ; Figure S2) and quantitative RT-PCR (Figures 1C and 1D; Figure S2). During neural induction, expression of pluripotency markers were rapidly lost whereas the neural marker PAX6 was detected (Figure S2). ISLET-1, an early marker of postmitotic motoneurons, also peaked at that stage (Figures 1C and 1D). At later stages, approximately 30% of TuJI-positive neurons expressed the motoneuron marker Hb9. Approximately 15% of cells showed a more mature cholinergic phenotype, as revealed by the expression of the vesicular acetylcholine transporter, VAChT (Figures 1A and 1B). No change in motoneuron markers was observed in DM1 cells when compared to controls, whether quantitatively or in their temporal appearance (Figures 1C and 1D; Figure S2). No defect was found in other cell types such as GABAergic neurons and astrocytes (Figure S2). Nuclear aggregation of mutant DMPK RNA was mainly detected in neuronal cells showing a motoneuron phenotype (Figures 1E and 1F). As described in patients' cells, these nuclear aggregates colocalized with the splicing factor MBNL1 (Figure S2). As a result, altered splicing of NMDAR1 was also observed, which reproduces the defect described in DM1 patients (Jiang et al., 2004Jiang H. Mankodi A. Swanson M.S. Moxley R.T. Thornton C.A. Myotonic dystrophy type 1 is associated with nuclear foci of mutant RNA, sequestration of muscleblind proteins and deregulated alternative splicing in neurons.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 3079-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) where the expression of the isoform containing exon 5 is increased (Figure 1G). Comparative analysis of neurite outgrowth was performed with panneuronal MAP2 and TuJI antibodies. Data showed a significant increase in overall MAP2 immunoreactivity in DM1 cells when compared to controls, without any significant differences in the number of neuronal cell bodies (Figures 2A and 2B ). Similar results were observed with TuJI (Figure S2). Neurite outgrowth for GABAergic and dopamine neurons are not different between DM1 and control cells, suggesting that neurite growth in nonmotor neurons is not affected. Coculture of hESC-derived neurons with human primary myotubes (Mu2bR3 cells) was then performed to determine the potential impact of neurite outgrowth alteration on synaptogenesis. Neuromuscular junctions were quantified via the codetection of the neuronal presynaptic marker TuJ1 and alpha bungarotoxin (BTX), which labels postsynaptic aggregation of acetylcholine receptors (Figure 2C). The significantly larger neurite network in DM1 cultures was associated with a significant 5- to 10-fold decrease in the number of neuromuscular contacts when compared to controls (Figure 2D). In summary, DM1 cells were characterized by abundant neuritogenesis associated with a significant impairment in the formation of neuromuscular connections. The gene expression and functional comparative analyses provided circumstantial evidence of a relationship between SLITRK4 downregulation and alteration in neurite outgrowth and synaptogenesis in DM1 cell cultures. By using quantitative PCR, we systematically screened DM1 cells for the expression of other genes that may be involved in neurite outgrowth (Chen and Cheng, 2009Chen S.Y. Cheng H.J. Functions of axon guidance molecules in synapse formation.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2009; 19: 471-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, Guan and Rao, 2003Guan K.L. Rao Y. Signalling mechanisms mediating neuronal responses to guidance cues.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 941-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar): the six members of the SLITRK gene family, five ephrin ligands and receptors, Robo1, three semaphorins, DCC, neurogenin, and neuropilin. This analysis confirmed the downregulation of SLITRK4 expression and showed a change in the expression only of the closely related SLITRK2 gene (Figures 3A–3G ); no other tested gene was altered (Figure 3A). Because SLITRK2 and SLITRK4 are located in the same region Xq27 of the X chromosome, additional genes located in the same portion were studied. No defect in any of these genes was observed (Figures 3B–3E; Figure S3). Chromosomal integrity was also verified by CGH array analysis (data not shown). The relationship between decreased expression of SLITRK2 and SLITRK4 in myotonic dystrophy type 1 was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR by means of brain tissue samples from fetal and adult patients (Figure 3H). Again, no alteration was found of any of the other screened neurite outgrowth genes (Figure S3). The presence of CTG repeat expansion also directly affects DMPK expression, so we investigated, in control hESC-derived neurons, whether downregulation of DMPK expression played a role in modulating SLITRK expression or neurite outgrowth. As shown in Figure S4, DMPK does not appear to be involved in SLITRK misexpression or in neurite outgrowth. In addition, disrupted splicing by MBNL1 does not seem to be involved in the defective expression of the two SLITRK genes, as shown by the fact that transfection of DM1 and control cells with siRNA to specifically knock down MBNL1 did not significantly change their expression (data not shown). Additional experiments were performed with DM1 cells to demonstrate the relationship between defects in SLITRK2 and SLITRK4 expression and functional alteration in neuritogenesis. First, rescue of the functional defect was carried out by transitory plasmid nucleofection (Amaxa technology) with SLITRK2 and SLITRK4 constructs into DM1 cell cultures. The majority of the cells were transiently transfected, based on the expression of a GFP construct (70% ± 9% SEM). One week after transfection, overexpression of the two genes had restored neurite length back to control levels (Figures 4A–4C ; Figure S4). Overexpression of each SLITRK gene separately was as effective as their combination (Figure 4C), suggesting that these genes are redundant. Consistent with previous results obtained in mouse neuronal cells (Aruga and Mikoshiba, 2003Aruga J. Mikoshiba K. Identification and characterization of Slitrk, a novel neuronal transmembrane protein family controlling neurite outgrowth.Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2003; 24: 117-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), we found that overexpression of SLITRK3 and SLITRK6 also decreased neurite outgrowth (Figure S4), which demonstrates the redundancy of these proteins. Conversely, stable knockdown of SLITRK2 and SLITRK4 in neurons derived from wild-type cultures, by means of shRNA-recombinant lentiviral vectors, induced a 2- to 3-fold increase in neurite length, compared to control cells treated with a GFP shRNA (Figures 4D–4F; Figure S4). Under these conditions, approximately 79% ± 11% SEM of cells were transduced. However, in these latter experiments the knockdown was not specific because each construct affected several SLITRK genes (Figure S4). The main result of the present study was the identification of a functional neuropathological defect in DM1 that impairs both neuritogenesis and synaptogenesis at an early developmental stage. This functional defect is associated with an abnormally low expression of two genes that belong to the SLITRK family. Extensive data exist showing the involvement of the CNS in DM1: psychological dysfunction, mental retardation, excessive daytime sleepiness, and neuropathological abnormalities (Abe et al., 1994Abe K.

Potential defects in neuritogenesis and synaptogenesis have also been suggested. DMPK has been proposed to have a role in the formation of the neuromuscular junction and signal transmission (van der Ven et al., 1993van der Ven P.F. Jansen G. van Kuppevelt T.H. Perryman M.B. Lupa M. Dunne P.W. ter Laak H.J. Jap P.H. Veerkamp J.H. Epstein H.F. et al.Myotonic dystrophy kinase is a component of neuromuscular junctions.Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 1889-1894Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Although this hypothesis has not been further substantiated, pathological motoneuron defects have been found in DM1. Ribonuclear aggregates of mutated DMPK RNA have been observed in the spinal motoneurons of patients (Wheeler et al., 2007Wheeler T.M. Krym M.C. Thornton C.A.

In neuromuscular junctions, synaptic hyperproliferation (Nagao et al., 2003Nagao M. Kato S. Hayashi H. Misawa H.

The sensory and motor nerve terminals.Neuropathol. Appl. Neurobiol. 1978; 4: 407-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) have been described in DM1 patients and animal models of the disease. Our results are consistent with these observations and indicate that functional defects in neuritogenesis and synaptogenesis at the neuromuscular junction may be associated with DM1 at an early developmental stage. The intracellular domains of SLITRK are similar to those of the TrkA neurotrophin receptor involved in NGF-induced neurite outgrowth (Blöchl and Blöchl, 2007Blöchl A. Blöchl R. A cell-biological model of p75NTR signaling.J. Neurochem. 2007; 102: 289-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Thus, similarities between the carboxy-terminal domain and Trk neurotrophin receptor suggests that SLITRKs could be involved in neurite outgrowth via PLCγ-mediated signaling and, as a consequence, actin assembly and disassembly (Reichardt, 2006Reichardt L.F. Neurotrophin-regulated signalling pathways.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2006; 361: 1545-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (1463) Google Scholar). It has been shown that transient expression of mouse Slitrk2 and 4 in rodent PC12 pheochromocytoma cells results in a strong inhibition of neurite outgrowth (Aruga and Mikoshiba, 2003Aruga J. Mikoshiba K. Identification and characterization of Slitrk, a novel neuronal transmembrane protein family controlling neurite outgrowth.Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2003; 24: 117-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The extracellular domains of SLITRK proteins share structural characteristics with the Slit/Robo family, which has been extensively studied (Ypsilanti et al., 2010Ypsilanti A.R. Zagar Y. Chédotal A. Moving away from the midline: New developments for Slit and Robo.Development. 2010; 137: 1939-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Similar to other protein families involved in neurite outgrowth and synaptic site recognition such as ephrins, netrins, and semaphorins, Slit/Robo proteins are responsible for the fine tuning of pre- and postsynaptic partners. A similar role for SLITRK proteins can be hypothesized based on the defects observed in DM1 cells. Indeed, the relationship between the abundant neuritogenesis and loss of synaptogenesis may reflect a slight alteration in recognition signals between the two synapse partners. Other members of the SLITRK family have been recently implicated in neurological dysfunctions. SLITRK1 may be involved in obsessive-compulsive disorder, trichotillomania (Zuchner et al., 2006Zuchner S. Cuccaro M.L. Tran-Viet K.N. Cope H. Krishnan R.R. Pericak-Vance M.A. Wright H.H.

https://openalex.org/W2073666490,"The collaboration and cross-talk between different classes of innate pattern recognition receptors are crucial for a well coordinated inflammatory response and host defense. Here we report a previously unrecognized role of scavenger receptor A (SRA; also known as CD204) as a signaling regulator in the context of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) activation. We show that SRA/CD204 deficiency leads to greater sensitivity to LPS-induced endotoxic shock. SRA/CD204 down-regulates inflammatory gene expression in dendritic cells by suppressing TLR4-induced activation of the transcription factor NF-κB. For the first time, we demonstrate that SRA/CD204 executes its regulatory functions by directly interacting with the TRAF-C domain of TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), resulting in inhibition of TRAF6 dimerization and ubiquitination. The attenuation of NF-κB activity by SRA/CD204 is independent of its ligand-binding domain, indicating that the signaling-regulatory feature of SRA/CD204 can be uncoupled from its conventional endocytic functions. Collectively, we have identified the molecular linkage between SRA/CD204 and the TLR4 signaling pathways, and our results reveal a novel mechanism by which a non-TLR pattern recognition receptor restricts TLR4 activation and consequent inflammatory response."
https://openalex.org/W2030330090,"Recent studies have shown that various neural and embryonic stem cells cultured in 1-8% oxygen (O(2)), levels lower than those typically used in cell culture (20.9%), displayed increased rates of proliferation; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying these changes are largely undefined. In this study, using rigorously controlled O(2) levels, we found that neural stem cells (NSCs) from embryonic day 15 rat cortex increased their rate of proliferation and migration in 1% O(2) relative to 20% O(2) without changes in viability. We sought to identify molecular changes in NSCs grown in 1% O(2) that might account for these increases. In 1% O(2), levels of the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor HIF-1α were transiently increased. Reduced adherence of NSCs in 1% O(2) to basement membrane-coated plates was observed, and quantitative RT-PCR analysis confirmed that the levels of mRNA for an assortment of cell adhesion and extracellular matrix molecules were altered. Most notable was a 5-fold increase in matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 mRNA. Specific inhibition of MMP-9 activity, verified using a fluorescent substrate assay, prevented the increase in proliferation and migration in 1% O(2). The canonical Wnt pathway was recently shown to be activated in stem cells in low O(2) via HIF-1α. Inhibition of Wnt signaling by DKK-1 also prevented the increase in proliferation, migration, and MMP-9 expression. Thus, MMP-9 is a key molecular effector, downstream of HIF-1α and Wnt activation, responsible for increased rates of NSC proliferation and migration in 1% O(2)."
https://openalex.org/W2143979123,"Protein quality control requires careful regulation of intracellular proteolysis. For DegP, a periplasmic protease, substrates promote assembly of inactive hexamers into proteolytically active cages with 12, 18, 24, or 30 subunits. Here, we show that sensitive activation and cage assembly require covalent linkage of distinct substrate sequences that affect degradation (degrons). One degron binds the DegP active site, and another degron binds a separate tethering site in PDZ1 in the crystal structure of a substrate-bound DegP dodecamer. FRET experiments demonstrate that active cages assemble rapidly in a reaction that is positively cooperative in substrate concentration, remain stably assembled while uncleaved substrate is present, and dissociate once degradation is complete. Thus, the energy of binding of linked substrate degrons drives assembly of the proteolytic machine responsible for subsequent degradation. Substrate cleavage and depletion results in disassembly, ensuring that DegP is proteolytically active only when sufficient quantities of protein substrates are present."
https://openalex.org/W1995397347,"Evidence suggests that epigenetic perturbations are involved in the adverse effects associated with some drugs and toxicants, including certain classes of non-genotoxic carcinogens. Such epigenetic changes (altered DNA methylation and covalent histone modifications) may take place at the earliest stages of carcinogenesis and their identification holds great promise for biomedical research. Here, we evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of genome-wide epigenomic and transcriptomic profiling in phenobarbital (PB)-treated B6C3F1 mice, a well-characterized rodent model of non-genotoxic liver carcinogenesis. Methylated DNA Immunoprecipitation (MeDIP)-coupled microarray profiling of 17,967 promoter regions and 4,566 intergenic CpG islands was combined with genome-wide mRNA expression profiling to identify liver tissue-specific PB-mediated DNA methylation and transcriptional alterations. Only a limited number of significant anti-correlations were observed between PB-induced transcriptional and promoter-based DNA methylation perturbations. However, the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) target gene Cyp2b10 was found to be concomitantly hypomethylated and transcriptionally activated in a liver tissue-specific manner following PB treatment. Furthermore, analysis of active and repressive histone modifications using chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed a strong PB-mediated epigenetic switch at the Cyp2b10 promoter. Our data reveal that PB-induced transcriptional perturbations are not generally associated with broad changes in the DNA methylation status at proximal promoters and suggest that the drug-inducible CAR pathway regulates an epigenetic switch from repressive to active chromatin at the target gene Cyp2b10. This study demonstrates the utility of integrated epigenomic and transcriptomic profiling for elucidating early mechanisms and biomarkers of non-genotoxic carcinogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2057390081,"Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PaC) is one of most difficult tumors to treat. Much of this is attributed to the late diagnosis. To identify biomarkers for early detection, we examined DNA methylation differences in leukocyte DNA between PaC cases and controls in a two-phase study. In phase I, we measured methylation levels at 1,505 CpG sites in treatment-naïve leukocyte DNA from 132 never-smoker PaC patients and 60 never-smoker healthy controls. We found significant differences in 110 CpG sites (false discovery rate <0.05). In phase II, we tested and validated 88 of 96 phase I selected CpG sites in 240 PaC cases and 240 matched controls (p≤0.05). Using penalized logistic regression, we built a prediction model consisting of five CpG sites (IL10_P348, LCN2_P86, ZAP70_P220, AIM2_P624, TAL1_P817) that discriminated PaC patients from controls (C-statistic = 0.85 in phase I; 0.76 in phase II). Interestingly, one CpG site (LCN2_P86) alone could discriminate resectable patients from controls (C-statistic = 0.78 in phase I; 0.74 in phase II). We also performed methylation quantitative trait loci (methQTL) analysis and identified three CpG sites (AGXT_P180_F, ALOX12_E85_R, JAK3_P1075_R) where the methylation levels were significantly associated with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (false discovery rate <0.05). Our results demonstrate that epigenetic variation in easily obtainable leukocyte DNA, manifested by reproducible methylation differences, may be used to detect PaC patients. The methylation differences at certain CpG sites are partially attributable to genetic variation. This study strongly supports future epigenome-wide association study using leukocyte DNA for biomarker discovery in human diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2133843400,"Dystroglycanopathies are a subset of congenital muscular dystrophies wherein α-dystroglycan (α-DG) is hypoglycosylated. α-DG is an extensively O-glycosylated extracellular matrix-binding protein and a key component of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex. Previous studies have shown α-DG to be post-translationally modified by both O-GalNAc- and O-mannose-initiated glycan structures. Mutations in defined or putative glycosyltransferase genes involved in O-mannosylation are associated with a loss of ligand-binding activity of α-DG and are causal for various forms of congenital muscular dystrophy. In this study, we sought to perform glycomic analysis on brain O-linked glycan structures released from proteins of three different knock-out mouse models associated with O-mannosylation (POMGnT1, LARGE (Myd), and DAG1(-/-)). Using mass spectrometry approaches, we were able to identify nine O-mannose-initiated and 25 O-GalNAc-initiated glycan structures in wild-type littermate control mouse brains. Through our analysis, we were able to confirm that POMGnT1 is essential for the extension of all observed O-mannose glycan structures with β1,2-linked GlcNAc. Loss of LARGE expression in the Myd mouse had no observable effect on the O-mannose-initiated glycan structures characterized here. Interestingly, we also determined that similar amounts of O-mannose-initiated glycan structures are present on brain proteins from α-DG-lacking mice (DAG1) compared with wild-type mice, indicating that there must be additional proteins that are O-mannosylated in the mammalian brain. Our findings illustrate that classical β1,2-elongation and β1,6-GlcNAc branching of O-mannose glycan structures are dependent upon the POMGnT1 enzyme and that O-mannosylation is not limited solely to α-DG in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2014054101,"Here, we examine tRNA-aminoacyl synthetase (ARS) localization in protein synthesis. Proteomics reveals that ten of the twenty cytosolic ARSs associate with ribosomes in sucrose gradients: phenylalanyl-RS (FRS), and the 9 ARSs that form the multi-ARS complex (MSC). Using the ribopuromycylation method (RPM) for localizing intracellular translation, we show that FRS and the MSC, and to a lesser extent other ARSs, localize to translating ribosomes, most strikingly when translation is restricted to poxvirus or alphavirus factories in infected cells. Immunoproximity fluorescence indicates close proximity between MSC and the ribosome. Stress induced-translational shutdown recruits the MSC to stress-granules, a depot for mRNA and translation components. MSC binding to mRNA provides a facile explanation for its delivery to translating ribosomes and stress granules. These findings, along with the abundance of the MSC (9 × 106 copies per cell, roughly equimolar with ribosomes), is consistent with the idea that MSC specificity, recently reported to vary with cellular stress (Netzer, N., Goodenbour, J.

Protein translation is a highly choreographed process performed by a number of remarkable enzymes, including ribosomes and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (ARSs). 2The abbreviations used are: ARSaminoacyl-tRNA synthetaseMSCaminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complexAsarseniteCHXcycloheximideDIGdigitoninDRCDig-resistant compartmentDRSarginyl-RSERendoplasmic reticulumFRAPfluorescence recovery after photobleachingFRSphenylalanyl-RSKRSlysyl-RSMRSmethionyl-RSNPnucleoproteinNRSasparaginyl-RSPuropuromycinPLAproximity ligation assayRPMribopuromycylation methodSFVSemliki Forest VirusSRSseryl-RSYRStyrosyl-RSVVvaccinia virus1D LC MS/MSreverse phase liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. ARSs catalyze the attachment of amino acids to their cognate tRNAs by an amino-acyl bond (1Schimmel P.R. Söll D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 601-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). The eukaryotic cell cytosol has 20 ARSs, each highly specific for one of the 20 standard amino acids used in synthesis. Mitochondria use a largely non-overlapping set of nuclear gene encoded ARSs for their own unique translation machinery. Ten ARSs (designated by single letter amino acid) code as ARS: EPRS (ERS and PRS are present in a single protein), DRS, IRS, KRS, LRS, MRS, QRS, RRS) form a single complex (2Bandyopadhyay A.K. Deutscher M.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 60: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 3Kellermann O. Brevet A. Tonetti H. Waller J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 99: 541-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), associated with 3 accessory components (p18, p38, p43) to create the multi-aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex (MSC) (4Quevillon S.

MSC is likely present in all eukaryotic cells, but has not been found in bacterial or archaeal cells (5Kerjan P. Cerini C. Sémériva M. Mirande M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1199: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The MSC may exist as a complex in part to control the non-canonical functions of its components, many of which are known to perform alternative duties ranging from suppressing translation to regulating apoptosis, inflammation or angiogenesis (6Park S.G. Ewalt K.L. Kim S. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 569-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). More directly related to its primary function, the MSC may optimize translation by coordinating synthetase activities to facilitate channeling of tRNA to ribosomes, a concept championed by Deutscher and co-workers (7Kyriacou S.V. Deutscher M.P. Mol. Cell. 2008; 29: 419-427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 8Stapulionis R. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 7158-7161Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Consistent with this idea, the MSC is known to co-sediment with both free and membrane-bound ribosomes (9Hampel A. Enger M.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 79: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 10Ussery M.A. Tanaka W.K. Hardesty B. Eur. J.

It has been known for decades that active ribosomes are either docked to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or free in the cytosol (mitochondria possess unique ribosomes translating 13 mitochondrial genes). It has generally been assumed that ER-bound ribosomes exclusively translate proteins that are exported into the ER via signal sequences that dock ribosomes to the ER (12Blobel G. Chembiochem. 2000; 1: 86-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Nicchitta and co-workers (13Stephens S.B. Nicchitta C.V. Mol. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 23314-23320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) have provided compelling evidence that a large subset of ER-bound ribosomes translates proteins lacking signal sequences that are targeted to the cytosol or nucleus. ER bound versus cytosolic ribosomes can be physically separated based on the diffusion of cytosolic ribosomes from live cells treated with digitonin (Dig) (18Stephens S.B. Nicchitta C.V. Methods Enzymol. 2007; 431: 47-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Our interest in aminoacyl synthetase function was prompted by our recent discovery that the fidelity of Met attachment to tRNA is decreased up to 10-fold in cultured cells following their infection with a variety of viruses, activation of innate immune receptors, or exposure to chemical stress (19Netzer N. Goodenbour J.M. David A. Dittmar K.A. Jones R.B. Schneider J.R. Boone D. Eves E.M. Rosner M.R. Gibbs J.S. Embry A. Dolan B. Das S. Hickman H.D. Berglund P. Bennink J.R. Yewdell J.W. Pan T. Nature. 2009; 462: 522-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). To better understand this phenomenon, we have characterized the distribution and function of ARSs in unperturbed cells and cells subjected to infectious and chemical stress. Our findings have broad implications for the function of ARSs in translation and translational shut down in normal cells and cells experiencing infectious, chemical, or physical stress. HeLa and 293T cells were cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 7.5% FBS (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT), at 37 °C, 9% COR2R. Cells were plated overnight in T75 or T165 flasks to yield ∼80% confluence at the start of the experiment. We generated the stable KRS-myc expressing HeLa cell line by transfecting with a KRS-myc plasmid generously supplied by Dr Sunghoon Kim (Center for Medicinal Protein Network and Systems Biology, Seoul National University, Seoul). 293T cells were pretreated 5 min with 100 μg/ml of CHX, before being collected, washed, and resuspended in ice cold homogenization buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 25 mm KCl, 0.2 m sucrose, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 100 μg/ml CHX, EDTA-free protease inhibitors (Roche), 10 units/ml RNase Out (Invitrogen), DEPC water). We then stroked cells 10 times using a homogenizer on ice and the lysate was spun 20,000 × g for 10min at 4 °C. The cleared lysate was layered at a 1:1 ratio (v/v) over sucrose (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 25 mm KCl, 2 m sucrose, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 100 μg/ml CHX, EDTA-free protease inhibitors (Roche), 10 units/ml RNase Out (Invitrogen), DEPC water). After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 24 h at 4 °C, pellets were resuspended in homogenization buffer and layered on 15–50% sucrose gradient in the same buffer without detergents. Following centrifugation at 35,000 rpm (Beckman, SW41.Ti) for 2.5 h at 4 °C, gradients were fractionated with absorbance measured continuously at 254 nm. Ribosomes fractions were pooled, and after pelleting at 100,000 × g for 5 h at 4 °C, were used for proteomic analysis. HeLa cells were infected with WR VV at a multiplicity of 1 or 10 pfu/cell in BSS/BSA medium, SFV at a multiplicity of 10 pfu/cell in BSS/BSA. After adsorption at 37 °C for 1h, infected monolayers were overlaid with DMEM containing 7.5% FBS and incubated for several more hours (depending on the experiment). To elicit oxidative stress, cells were treated with 500 μm sodium arsenite for 30 min to 1 h at 37 °C. Extracts were prepared from HeLa cells by sequential detergent extraction based on a previous publication (Lerner and Nicchitta, 15). Briefly, cell monolayers were washed with PBS, and incubated for 5 min on ice with permeabilization buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 25 mm KCl, 100 μg/ml CHX, EDTA-free protease inhibitors (Roche)), 10 units/ml RNase Out (Invitrogen)) containing 0.015% digitonin. The supernatant was recovered, and cells were rewashed once with permeabilization buffer. Permeabilized cell monolayers were then solubilized with an equal volume of permeabilization buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40 for 5 min on ice. The supernatant (membrane-bound fraction) was recovered, and both DSC and DRC were loaded on SDS-PAGE gel. Rabbit antibodies against KRS, MRS, EPRS, P18 were purchased from Abcam. Mouse anti-SRS antibodies were from Abnova. Mouse anti-puromycin mAb has been described (20Schmidt E.K. Clavarino G. Ceppi M. Pierre P. Nat. Methods. 2009; 6: 275-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). Goat anti-Hur was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Human anti-ribosomal P antiserum was from Immunovision. Cells were cultured on glass coverslips. Puromycin pulses were performed by incubating cells with 50 μg/ml of puromycin for 5 min at 37 °C in the presence of 100 μg/ml of CHX. Cells were washed with cold PBS (supplemented with CHX) and extracted with digitonin supplemented permeabilization buffer as described in “cell extraction.” Following a wash with cold permeabilization buffer, cells were fixed 15 min with 3% paraformaldehyde (PFA) at room temperature. To characterize the DRC, cells were extracted with digitonin as described for puromycin staining and then incubated for 15 min at room temperature with 3% PFA. PLA experiments were performed either alone or in combination with puromycin labeling according to the manufacturer's protocol (Olink). Immunofluorescence was performed using staining buffer (0.05% saponin, 10 mm glycine, 5% FBS, PBS) as previously described (21Lelouard H. Gatti E. Cappello F. Gresser O. Camosseto V. Pierre P. Nature. 2002; 417: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Following immunostaining, cells were labeled with Hoechst 3358 (Molecular Probes). Coverslips were mounted onto glass slides with Fluoromount-G (SouthernBiotech). Images were acquired with a Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope (LAS AF software) using the HCX PLAPO 63× objective (numerical aperture: 1.4). Images were processed with Adobe Photoshop using only level and contrast adjustments. Co-localization statistical analysis was performed uisng the ImageJ software JACoP plug-in. For deconvolution we used Huygens Essentials software (Version 3.6, Scientific Volume Imaging BV, Hilversum, The Netherlands). Imaris (Bitplane) was used for quantification and statistical analysis. HeLa cells were treated with either puromycin or a combination of puromycin and CHX with the same concentration used for immunofluorescence staining. HeLa cells expressing myc-KRS (and control HeLa cells) were fractionated as described in “ribosome purification.” MSC-containing fractions were incubated overnight with anti-c-Myc agarose beads (Sigma). Beads were washed three times with sucrose-free homogenization buffer, and MSC was eluted using Tris-glycine buffer, pH 2.8. The concentration of purified MSC was calculated using the DC Protein Assay (Bio-Rad). Known amounts of MSC were immunoblotted for KRS. ImageJ was used to quantitate each band, and the data were used to generate a standard curve using Prism software was used to draw a standard curve (supplemental Fig. 2C). In parallel, a known number of HeLa cells (17,600 cells/μl of lysis buffer) were lysed, diluted, immunoblotted, and the standard curve was used to quantitate the amount of MSC per cell. Only values within the initial part of the curve (in blue) were exploited for quantification. We used MSC MW, 1200 kDa to calculate the number of molecules per HeLa cell. Four cDNAs were used for this experiment, two from cellular mRNA (ApoB, Rent-1), two from IAV mRNA (NA, PB1). Each served as a template for radiolabeled in vitro transcription using HiScribe T7 (New England Biolabs) and [32P]UTP (Perkin Elmer). Samples were treated 15 min with TURBO DNase I (Ambion) at 37 °C and purified by phenol-chloroform extraction. In parallel, we purified MSC as described above, using 106 cells and 30 μl of anti-Myc beads per condition. Beads (control or MSC bound) and each purified mRNA (∼2 μg) were incubated for 40 min in at RT in RNA hybridization buffer (5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm Tris-HCl pH7.4), washed three times with the same buffer and eluted by incubation with Laemmli sample buffer (Tris-HCl, 0.08 m, pH 6.8, glycerol 10%, SDS 2%, DTT 0.1 m) for 10 min at 95 °C. CPM of each sample (total mRNA labeling and elution) were measured using a Microbeta TriLux counter (Perkin Elmer). For competition experiments, we used different concentrations of yeast tRNA (Ambion) added to beads before addition of radiolabeled mRNA probe. We purified MSC as described in “MSC purification,” except for the elution step. Raw RNA samples were extracted from beads briefly with Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), followed by addition of 0.2× volume chloroform at 4 °C. An equal volume of 70% ethanol was added to the aqueous phase, followed by purification of RNA on RNeasy spin columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). RNA was quantitated with a nanodrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE). Equal amounts of RNA were reverse transcribed with Verso RT (Thermo Scientific, Surrey, UK). Primer sets consisted of VVTK forward (GGATCCATCATGAACGGCGGACATATTC) and VVTK reverse (ACGTTGAAATGTCCCATCGAG), resulting in a product of 354 nt. Human gene control primers were obtained from PrimerDesign Ltd, (Southampton, UK). RT-PCR was performed on an Eppendorf Mastercycler ep realplex (Eppendorf AG, Hamburg, DE) using Power SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA). Gel lanes from either polyribosome samples or tRNA synthetase pull-downs were manually excised top to bottom into 20 ∼2-mm bands. In-gel tryptic digestion and peptide extraction followed a modified version of a standard protocol recently described.(22McFarland M.A. Ellis C.E. Markey S.P. Nussbaum R.L. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2008; 7: 2123-2137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) For 1D liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (1D-LC-MS/MS) extracted peptides were resuspended in 5% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid. For the work in this report, three different Thermo mass spectrometers (Thermo Electron, San Jose, CA) coupled to the same type of precolumn and analytical column were used for data acquisition. Peptide samples from isolated polysomes were injected into either a Shimadzu LC-VP HPLC system (Shimadzu, Columbia, MD) coupled online to an ESI LCQ Classic quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer or a Nano LC 1D Proteomics HPLC system (Eksigent, Dublin, CA) coupled online to a linear ion trap (LTQ)-Orbitrap mass spectrometer equipped with a Nanomate nanoelectrospray ionization source (Advion, Ithaca, NY). Samples from tRNA synthetase pull-downs were injected into the same type of Eksigent HPLC system coupled online to a separate LTQ mass spectrometer. After injection, all peptide samples were desalted and preconcentrated online with a nano-C18 precolumn (300 μm × 5 mm) and then separated using a 75 μm x 10 cm BetaBasic-18 PicoFrit analytical column (New Objective, Woburn, MA) connected to the nanospray source. A linear gradient was developed using a 400 nl/min flow rate. LC mobile phases were A: 95% water/5% acetonirile/0.1% formic acid, B: 20% water/80% acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid. Retained analyte were eluted by increasing the acetonitrile concentration to 60% (1.5% per min (LCQ) or 1.25% per min (LTQ)). All 1D LC/MS/MS experiments were operated such that spectra were acquired for 60 min in the data-dependent mode with dynamic exclusion enabled. The top 3 peaks (LCQ) and top 5 peaks (LTQ) in the 400–2000 m/z range of every MS survey scan were fragmented. Specifically for the LTQ-Orbitrap, survey spectra were acquired with 60000 resolution in the Orbi-mass analyzer and fragmented in the LTQ ion trap. Fragmentation spectra were searched using the Mascot search engine (Matrix Sciences, London, UK) against the Human data base (created from the Uniprot Knowledgebase release 14.8) containing the porcine trypsin sequence and the reverse decoy of all translated sequences concatenated. All used in this work are in the process of being submitted to the NCBI peptide data resource and an accession number will be provided shortly. Search parameters were as follows: trypsin specificity, 3 missed cleavages, carbamidomethylation static modification, methionine oxidation variable modification, and +1, +2, and +3 charge states. The LCQ and LTQ precursor ion mass tolerance was ± 2.0 Da and the fragment ion mass tolerance was ± 0.8 Da. For the LTQ-Orbitrap the precursor ion mass tolerance was ± 0.5 Da and the fragment ion mass tolerance was ± 0.8 Da. For the polyribosome data, a total of 6 separate purifications (6 gel lanes) were performed where 4 LCQ and 2 LTQ-Orbitrap datasets were acquired. In both cases these data gave similar protein identification results: although the number of spectra and peptides identified are higher for the LTQ-Orbitrap. For the tRNA synthetase pull-down data a total of 4 separate pull-downs and 2 negative controls were performed (6 gel lanes) where 6 LTQ datasets were acquired. All 6 polysome datasets were concatenated and the resulting peptide identifications were assembled into protein identifications using the in-house software MassSieve (23Slotta D.J. McFarland M.A. Markey S.P. Proteomics. 2010; 16: 3035-3039Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). MassSieve was also used to compare the four concatenated tRNA synthetase pull-down data with negative control data. MassSieve filters were adjusted to include only peptide identifications with Mascot Ion Scores equal to or exceeding their identity scores. This resulted in a calculated false positive discovery (FDR) rate of 1.0% for the polyribosome data and 2.6% for the tRNA synthetase pull-down data (FDR = 2 Nd/(Nd + Nt); where Nd and Nt are the number of matched decoy and target peptides passing the above cutoff, respectively). In both experimental data sets, MassSieve was used for peptide and protein level parsimony comparisons. A minimum of 2 peptides was required for a protein to be considered sufficiently identified. Various ARSs have been reported to be associated with ribosomes based on tRNA charging activity with different amino acids (10Ussery M.A. Tanaka W.K. Hardesty B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 72: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We extended this observation is by performing 1D reverse phase liquid chromatography tandem (LC) mass spectrometry (MS/MS) to analyze proteins co-sedimenting with HeLa cell polysomes in sucrose gradients (Table 1 and supplemental Fig. S1). Using the algorithm Mascot to search MS/MS spectra against the human data base, we identified 10 out of the 20 tRNA synthetases. The nine defined synthetases of the MSC, and as anticipated from prior studies (24Robinson J.C. Kerjan P. Mirande M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 983-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), FRS (the lone free ARS to form multimers, comprised of α2β2 subunits) (25Mosyak L. Reshetnikova L. Goldgur Y. Delarue M. Safro M.G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). We additionally identified 80% of the ribosomal proteins for large and small subunits, qualitatively validating the ribosomal composition of our samples (see supplemental Table S1, A and B). All 10 synthetase components were identified by a similar array of ARS peptides in samples from cells infected with influenza A virus (IAV) (∼75% of those identified in uninfected cells, supplemental Table S1C), demonstrating that IAV infection does not grossly interfere with the association between ribosomes and ARSs.TABLE 1tRNA synthetases identified by 1D LC MS/MS analysis of polysome fractionsProtein nameAccession numberPeptide IDsMatched spectra% Sequence coverageBifunctional aminoacyl-tRNA synthetaseP078144225762Isoleucyl-tRNA synthetaseP412522211824Arginyl-tRNA synthetaseP54136175640Aspartyl-tRNA synthetaseP14868165943Glutaminyl-tRNA synthetaseP4789771911Leucyl-tRNA synthetaseP41252113515Lysyl-tRNA synthetaseQ1504641511Methionyl-tRNA synthetaseP56192104819Phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase alpha chainQ9Y28587925Phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase beta chainQ9NSD9156535Multisynthetase complex auxiliary component p38Q131552313Multisynthetase complex auxiliary component p43aA single peptide was matched by multiple spectra to these proteins.Q12904164Multisynthetase complex auxiliary component p18aA single peptide was matched by multiple spectra to these proteins.0433241214a A single peptide was matched by multiple spectra to these proteins. Open table in a new tab We next examined the co-sedimentation of ARSs with ribosomes by immunoblotting sucrose gradient fractions prepared from Nonidet P-40 extracts (Fig. 1A). SRS, as expected from previous studies (26Geels J. Bont W.S. Rezelman G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1971; 144: 773-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), was present at the top of the gradient, consistent with its sedimentation free of binding partners. More than 90% of FRS co-sedimented with monosome and polysome fractions. We monitored MSC behavior using antibodies specific for KRS and MRS. Nearly 80% of the MSC sedimented independently of ribosomes as free complexes (fractions 3–5). Surprisingly, the bulk of ribosome associated MSCs were present in crescendo in the densest fractions (inversely proportional to S3 and ribosomal phosphoprotein (P) expression), therefore presenting an expression profile distinct from FRS and the overall polysome profile. We more accurately quantitated MSC behavior by immunoblotting three pooled gradient fractions corresponding to soluble, MSC, and polysome fractions (Fig. 1B). This clearly showed that only a small fraction of the MSC (as identified by anti-KRS, -MRS, or -DRS antibodies) stably co-sediment with polysomes under these conditions. By contrast, FRS predominantly sediments with polysomes, while SRS and YRS do not detectably co-sediment with polysomes. Based on their behavior in sucrose gradient fractionation, we conclude that the various ARSs can be divided into three categories. FRS, which predominantly associates stably with polysomes, the MSC, which tenuously associates with polysomes, and SRS, YRS, and likely (based on their absence in mass spectrometry analysis) the 8 other synthetases, which do not stably associate with ribosomes under these conditions. The ARS-ribosome interaction in sucrose may not accurately reflect the situation in cells, particularly if the interaction is weak, transient, or dependent on active metabolic processes. To better gauge the interaction of ribosomes with ARSs, we examined their intracellular distribution by immunofluorescence. We used antibodies specific for MRS or KRS to characterize MSC, because these synthetases are nearly exclusively present in the MSC and not as individual ARSs (Fig. 1B). MRS and KRS demonstrate a nearly identical intracellular distribution; each extensively co-localizing with ribosomes stained with human anti-ribosomal P antibody (Fig. 1C). The pattern of staining was typical of the ER. Treating cells with digitonin prior to fixation to remove cytosolic ribosomes, as described by Nicchitta and co-workers (13Stephens S.B. Nicchitta C.V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 623-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), resulted in almost perfect co-localization of KRS and MRS with ribosomes (Fig. 1C). Importantly, Dig extraction had little effect on the intensity of KRS and MRS staining, indicating that most MSC detected by immunofluorescence associates with the ER compartment. Immunoblotting confirmed that nearly all of the MSC resists Dig extraction (Fig. 2E). Interestingly, while SRS co-localizes extensively with KRS, it is largely extracted by Dig, both by immunofluorescence (Fig. 1D) and immunoblotting analysis (Fig. 2D). Proteasomes are also nearly completely Dig-extractable, demonstrating that not all large protein assemblies are Dig resistant (supplemental Fig. S1B). We next correlated the distribution of ARSs with translating ribosomes using the ribopuromycylation method (RPM). RPM is based on incorporation of puromycin (Puro) into nascent chains, whose association with ribosomes is maintained by the presence of chain elongation inhibitors such as cycloheximide (CHX). We then visualize puromycylated ribosome associated-nascent chains via immunofluorescence with a Puro specific mAb after Dig treatment of live cells, which eliminates free Puro staining (Fig. 2A). Puro extensively colocalizes with ER-associated ribosomes and KRS (Fig. 2A). Blocking translation by treating cells with the translation initiation inhibitor pactamycin (27Kappen L.S. Suzuki H. Goldberg I.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1973; 70: 22-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), or the oxidizing agent arsenite (As) (28Kedersha N.L. Gupta M. Li W. Miller I. Anderson P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1431-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar), completely inhibits Puro staining, demonstrating that it is a bona fide measure of active protein synthesis (Fig. 2, B and C). Importantly, translation inhibition induced by either treatment clearly reduces KRS staining of cytosol-depleted cells by releasing it into the cytosol, while modestly reducing ribosomal staining. Using immunoblotting, we extended these findings to show that translational arrest has minor effects on the total amounts of KRS, MRS, FRS, SRS, ribosomes, or proteasomes recovered from cells (Fig. 2D). Importantly, both arsenite and pactamycin release KRS, MRS, FRS and ribosomes from the Dig resistant compartment (DRC) without increasing SRS or proteasome release. We then performed three-dimensional deconvolution on Z-stack images from RPM-labeled HeLa cells (Fig. 3A) to minimize noise from out of focus sections. KRS and RPM staining exhibit a similar tangled-reticular pattern throughout the cell. A close look reveals punctuated areas where KRS and RPM extensively co-localize, as confirmed by statistical analysis (Pearson's coefficient higher than 0.5). By contrast, ribosomal P staining exhibits a distinct distribution, concentrating in cell periphery. This observation underscores our key finding that the MSC ass"
https://openalex.org/W2064387021,"Global genomic repair (GGR) and transcription coupled repair (TCR) are two pathways of nucleotide excision repair (NER) that differ in the damage recognition step. How NER factors, especially GGR factors, access DNA damage in the chromatin of eukaryotic cells has been poorly understood. Dot1, a histone methyltransferase required for methylation of histone H3 lysine 79 (H3K79), has been shown to confer yeast cells with resistance to DNA-damaging agents and play a role in activation of DNA damage checkpoints. Here, we show that Dot1 and H3K79 methylation are required for GGR in both nucleosomal core regions and internucleosomal linker DNA, but play no role in TCR. H3K79 trimethylation contributes to but is not absolutely required for GGR, and lower levels of H3K79 methylation (mono- and dimethylation) also promote GGR. Our results also indicate that the roles of Dot1 and H3K79 methylation in GGR are not achieved by either activating DNA damage checkpoints or regulating the expression of the GGR-specific factor Rad16. Rather, the methylated H3K79 may serve as a docking site for the GGR machinery on the chromatin. Our studies identified a novel GGR-specific NER factor and unveiled the critical link between a covalent histone modification and GGR."

We applied this new modality to visualize deep tissue abscesses during acute and chronic phase of inflammation caused by Staphylococcus aureus infection. Methodology and Principal Findings In this study, a murine thigh infection model was used to induce abscess formation and PFC or CLIO (cross linked ironoxides) was administered during acute or chronic phase of inflammation. 24 h after inoculation, the contrast agent accumulation was imaged at the site of infection by MRI. Measurements revealed a strong accumulation of PFC at the abscess rim at acute and chronic phase of infection. The pattern was similar to CLIO accumulation at chronic phase and formed a hollow sphere around the edema area. Histology revealed strong influx of neutrophils at the site of infection and to a smaller extend macrophages during acute phase and strong influx of macrophages at chronic phase of inflammation. Conclusion and Significance We introduce 19F-MRI in combination with PFC nanoemulsions as a new platform to visualize abscess formation in a murine thigh infection model of S. aureus. The possibility to track immune cells in vivo by this modality offers new opportunities to investigate host immune response, the efficacy of antibacterial therapies and the influence of virulence factors for pathogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2029304670,"Bilingualism provides a unique opportunity for understanding the relative roles of proficiency and order of acquisition in determining how the brain represents language. In a previous study, we combined magnetoencephalography (MEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to examine the spatiotemporal dynamics of word processing in a group of Spanish-English bilinguals who were more proficient in their native language. We found that from the earliest stages of lexical processing, words in the second language evoke greater activity in bilateral posterior visual regions, while activity to the native language is largely confined to classical left hemisphere fronto-temporal areas. In the present study, we sought to examine whether these effects relate to language proficiency or order of language acquisition by testing Spanish-English bilingual subjects who had become dominant in their second language. Additionally, we wanted to determine whether activity in bilateral visual regions was related to the presentation of written words in our previous study, so we presented subjects with both written and auditory words. We found greater activity for the less proficient native language in bilateral posterior visual regions for both the visual and auditory modalities, which started during the earliest word encoding stages and continued through lexico-semantic processing. In classical left fronto-temporal regions, the two languages evoked similar activity. Therefore, it is the lack of proficiency rather than secondary acquisition order that determines the recruitment of non-classical areas for word processing."

This multimodal HER20targeted MR imaging probe integrates a de novo designed protein contrast agent with a high affinity HER2 affibody and a near IR fluorescent dye. Our probe can differentially monitor tumors with different expression levels of HER2 in both human cell lines and xenograft mice models. In addition to its 100-fold higher dose efficiency compared to clinically approved non-targeting contrast agent DTPA, our developed agent also exhibits advantages in crossing the endothelial boundary, tissue distribution, and tumor tissue retention over reported contrast agents as demonstrated by even distribution of the imaging probe across the entire tumor mass.

Using in vitro mixtures of sperm and seminal fluid from pairs of male crickets, we show that seminal fluid can affect the viability of sperm in this species. We found that males who invest greatly in the viability of their own sperm can enhance the viability of rival sperm, providing the opportunity for males to exploit the investments in sperm competition made by their rivals. Transitive effects of seminal fluids across the ejaculates of different males are expected to have important implications for the dynamics of male investments in sperm competition."
https://openalex.org/W1970461208,"Biological particle mixing (bioturbation) and solute transfer (bio-irrigation) contribute extensively to ecosystem functioning in sediments where physical mixing is low. Macrobenthos transports oxygen and organic matter deeper into the sediment, thereby likely providing favourable niches to lower trophic levels (i.e., smaller benthic animals such as meiofauna and bacteria) and thus stimulating mineralisation. Whether this biological transport facilitates fresh organic matter assimilation by the metazoan lower part of the food web through niche establishment (i.e., ecosystem engineering) or rather deprives them from food sources, is so far unclear. We investigated the effects of the ecosystem engineers Lanice conchilega (bio-irrigator) and Abra alba (bioturbator) compared to abiotic physical mixing events on survival and food uptake of nematodes after a simulated phytoplankton bloom. The (13)C labelled diatom Skeletonema costatum was added to 4 treatments: (1) microcosms containing the bioturbator, (2) microcosms containing the bio-irrigator, (3) control microcosms and (4) microcosms with abiotic manual surface mixing. Nematode survival and subsurface peaks in nematode density profiles were most pronounced in the bio-irrigator treatment. However, nematode specific uptake (Δδ(13)C) of the added diatoms was highest in the physical mixing treatment, where macrobenthos was absent and the diatom (13)C was homogenised. Overall, nematodes fed preferentially on bulk sedimentary organic material rather than the added diatoms. The total C budget (µg C m(-2)), which included TO(13)C remaining in the sediment, respiration, nematode and macrobenthic uptake, highlighted the limited assimilation by the metazoan benthos and the major role of bacterial respiration. In summary, bioturbation and especially bio-irrigation facilitated the lower trophic levels mainly over the long-term through niche establishment. Since the freshly added diatoms represented only a limited food source for nematodes, the macrobenthic effect was more pronounced in niche establishment than the negative structuring effects such as competition."
https://openalex.org/W1975925605,"Fusarium trichothecenes are fungal toxins that cause disease on infected plants and, more importantly, health problems for humans and animals that consume infected fruits or vegetables. Unfortunately, there are few methods for controlling mycotoxin production by fungal pathogens. In this study, we isolated and characterized sixteen Fusarium strains from naturally infected potato plants in the field. Pathogenicity tests were carried out in the greenhouse to evaluate the virulence of the strains on potato plants as well as their trichothecene production capacity, and the most aggressive strain was selected for further studies. This strain, identified as F. sambucinum, was used to determine if trichothecene gene expression was affected by the symbiotic Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (AMF) Glomus irregulare. AMF form symbioses with plant roots, in particular by improving their mineral nutrient uptake and protecting plants against soil-borne pathogens. We found that that G. irregulare significantly inhibits F. sambucinum growth. We also found, using RT-PCR assays to assess the relative expression of trichothecene genes, that in the presence of the AMF G. irregulare, F. sambucinum genes TRI5 and TRI6 were up-regulated, while TRI4, TRI13 and TRI101 were down-regulated. We conclude that AMF can modulate mycotoxin gene expression by a plant fungal pathogen. This previously undescribed effect may be an important mechanism for biological control and has fascinating implications for advancing our knowledge of plant-microbe interactions and controlling plant pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W1990754594,Background Cardiac remodelling after AMI is characterized by molecular and cellular mechanisms involving both the ischemic and non-ischemic myocardium. The extent of right ventricular (RV) dilatation and dysfunction and its relation to pulmonary hypertension (PH) following AMI are unknown. The aim of the current study was to evaluate changes in dimensions and function of the RV following acute myocardial infarction (AMI) involving the left ventricle (LV). Methods We assessed changes in RV dimensions and function 1 week following experimental AMI involving the LV free wall in 10 mice and assessed for LV and RV dimensions and function and for the presence and degree of PH. Results RV fractional area change and tricuspidal annular plane systolic excursion significantly declined by 33% (P = 0.021) and 28% (P = 0.001) respectively. Right ventricular systolic pressure measured invasively in the mouse was within the normal values and unchanged following AMI. Conclusion AMI involving the LV and sparing the RV induces a significant acute decline in RV systolic function in the absence of pulmonary hypertension in the mouse indicating that RV dysfunction developed independent of changes in RV afterload.

Chimeric proteins composed of domains from the two attachment proteins have been evaluated for fusion-promoting activity with each F protein. Chimeras having NiV G-derived globular domains and NDV HN-derived stalks, transmembranes, and cytoplasmic tails are efficiently expressed, bind ephrinB2, and trigger NDV F to promote fusion in Vero cells.

Paramyxoviruses gain entry into cells by promoting the direct fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. However, these viruses are unusual in that the receptor binding and fusion-promoting activities reside on two different spike structures (1Lamb R.A. Parks G.D. Fields Virology. 5th Ed. Wolters Kluwer/Lippincott Williams and Wilkins, Philadelphia2007: 1449-1496Google Scholar). For most paramyxoviruses, this distribution of functions requires a mechanism by which the two processes can be linked for the promotion of fusion. This is accomplished by a virus-specific interaction between the two proteins that makes it possible for receptor binding to trigger activation of the homologous fusion protein (reviewed in Refs. 1Lamb R.A.

The evaluation of chimeric attachment proteins composed of stalks and heads derived from the HN proteins of different members of the family has established that the stalk region of HN determines specificity for the homologous fusion (F) protein (11Deng R.

Subsequently, a domain was identified in the stalk of NDV HN (14Melanson V.R. Iorio R.M. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 13053-13061Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) that may mediate the interaction with F. An analogous domain was identified in the stalk of the measles virus attachment protein (15Lee J.K. Prussia A. Paal T. White L.K. Snyder J.P. Plemper R.K. J. Biol.

We have constructed and evaluated a series of chimeric attachment proteins composed of stalks and globular heads derived from the NDV HN and NiV G proteins. Our results reveal that it is possible to trigger the NDV F protein with chimeras that bind to the NiV receptor. This is the first demonstration of the triggering of a paramyxovirus F protein by binding to a different class of receptor. This indicates that an aspect of the NDV HN triggering cascade is conserved in the binding of NiV G to its receptor. However, the triggering of NDV F by these chimeras does not require a step that appears to be a requirement for the triggering of NiV F by the NiV G protein. Also, none of several NiV G stalk-NDV HN head chimeras is capable of triggering NiV F, despite efficient cell surface expression and receptor binding. Together, these findings suggest that the triggering cascade for NiV F is more complex than that for NDV F. We speculate that triggering of NiV F by the G protein may involve another contribution from the head region, distinct from its receptor binding activity. The preparation of pCAGGS expression vectors for the HN and F proteins of NDV strain Australia-Victoria has been described previously (17Li J. Quinlan E. Mirza A. Iorio R.M. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 5299-5310Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The HN and F genes were generously provided by Trudy Morrison and Robert Lamb, respectively. The NiV G gene was inserted into pCAGGS between the ClaI and StuI sites, and the NiV F gene was inserted between EcoRI and SacI. All chimeras were constructed in pBluescript SK(+) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and facilitated by the introduction of HindIII sites at the desired positions in both NDV HN and NiV G using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The segments specific for the N-terminal stalk regions of the proteins were exchanged. In each chimera, there is a lysine-leucine insertion between the two segments necessary for the introduction of the HindIII site. Vero or PK13 (ephrinB2- and B3-deficient) cells (ATCC) were used for experiments involving chimeras with HN-derived stalks and G-derived heads (HN-G chimeras). BHK-21F cells (generous gift of Rebecca Dutch) were used for experiments involving the reciprocal chimeras (G-HN). For all experiments, cells were seeded in six-well plates at 2 × 105 cells/well 1 day prior to transfection. WT and chimeric proteins were expressed using the Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen) and 1 μg of each DNA per well, according to protocols provided by the company. All assays were performed at 48 h post-transfection. Cell surface expression was quantified by flow cytometry (performed by the University of Massachusetts Medical Center Flow Cytometry Core Laboratory) using a NiV G-specific polyclonal antiserum (806) (18Aguilar H.C.

The ability of HN-G chimeras to bind ephrinB2 was determined by a modification of the procedure described by Negrete et al. (7Negrete O.A. Levroney E.L. Aguilar H.C. Bertolotti-Ciarlet A. Nazarian R. Tajyar S. Lee B. Nature. 2005; 436: 401-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). PK13 cells were transfected as above. The medium was removed, and the monolayers were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 2 μg of soluble ephrinB2-human Fc protein (ephrinB2-Fc) (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Binding of ephrinB2 was quantified by flow cytometry. The effect of receptor binding on the recognition of the HN-G chimeras by mAbs was determined by preincubating a monolayer of PK13 cells expressing the chimeras with soluble ephrinB2 and then quantifying the binding of the respective antibody by flow cytometry. The receptor binding activity of G-HN chimeras was assayed by their ability to adsorb guinea pig erythrocytes (Bio-Link Laboratories, Liverpool, NY). NA activity was determined colorimetrically using sialyllactose (Accurate Chemical & Scientific Co., Westbury, NY) as a substrate. Both protocols have been described previously (23Mahon P.J. Mirza A.M. Musich T.A. Iorio R.M. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 10386-10396Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The ability of each chimera to complement the F proteins in the promotion of cell-cell fusion was quantitated using a modification of a content-mixing assay (24Corey E.A. Mirza A.M. Levandowsky E. Iorio R.M. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 6913-6922Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), which measures β-galactosidase activity in target cells following fusion induced by the glycoprotein-expressing effector cells. Effector Vero or BHK-21F cells were transfected with 1 μg each of G/HN/chimera DNA and the NiV/NDV F DNA, as well as 1 μg of pCAGT7 DNA (25Okuma K. Nakamura M. Nakano S. Niho Y. Matsuura Y. Virology. 1999; 254: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) (generous gift of Eric Lazear). The following day, another set of monolayers (target) was infected with WT vaccinia virus (multiplicity of infection of 1 for Vero cells and 10 for BHK-21F cells) and transfected with 1 μg of pG1NT7β-galactosidase (26Nussbaum O. Broder C.C. Berger E.A. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5411-5422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Five hours later, the cells were trypsinized, and equal numbers of the two cell populations were combined and incubated overnight. The next day, the extent of fusion was quantitated colorimetrically. Proteins were immunoprecipitated with either antiserum 806 (HN-G chimeras) or with a mixture of conformation-specific anti-HN mAbs (G-HN chimeras) as described previously (23Mahon P.J. Mirza A.M. Musich T.A. Iorio R.M. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 10386-10396Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE in the presence or absence of β-mercaptoethanol. Rainbow markers were obtained from GE Healthcare. The cell surface expression of chimera 214G-HN124 was examined by biotinylation and Western blot. Cell surface proteins were biotinylated with membrane-impermeable sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (Pierce) for 30 min in the cold with gentle agitation. Cells were lysed, and proteins were immunoprecipitated as described above, boiled in 10% SDS, diluted 50-fold with TN buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm sodium chloride) and reprecipitated with streptavidin-agarose beads (Pierce). Proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot, using mAb 14f, which recognizes a linear epitope in NDV HN (22Iorio R.M. Syddall R.J. Sheehan J.P. Bratt M.A. Glickman R.L. Riel A.M. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 4999-5006Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The oligomeric structure of the HN-G chimeras was analyzed by sucrose gradient sedimentation analysis (27Melanson V.R. Iorio R.M. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 623-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To determine whether the NiV and NDV attachment and fusion proteins can complement each other in the promotion of fusion, heterologous combinations of the two proteins were coexpressed in Vero cells, and the monolayers were stained and examined for syncytium formation (Fig. 1). Although extensive syncytium formation was visible in the NiV G/NiV F-coexpressing cells and, although to a lesser extent, in the NDV HN/NDV F-coexpressing cells, no fusion was detected in cells coexpressing either heterologous combination of the attachment and fusion proteins. Similar results were obtained using BHK-21F cells (data not shown). Thus, NDV HN was unable to complement NiV F, and NiV G was unable to complement NDV F in the promotion of fusion. Because NDV HN and NiV G recognize different types of receptors, we wanted to determine whether attachment to the heterologous receptor is capable of triggering the promotion of fusion by the NDV F and NiV F proteins. To test this possibility, chimeric attachment proteins composed of stalks from one of the attachment proteins and globular domains from the heterologous attachment protein were constructed. There is a 24% amino acid homology between the NDV HN and NiV G proteins. A schematic diagram of the structures of the two proteins is shown in Fig. 2A. In the ectodomain of NDV HN, the transition from the stalk region to the head occurs between residues 123 and 124 (28Crennell S. Takimoto T. Portner A. Taylor G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1068-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), with the cysteine at position 123 mediating disulfide-linked dimer formation in some strains, including AV (29Sheehan J.P.

The specificity of NDV HN for its homologous F protein has been shown to be determined by the stalk region of the protein (11Deng R. Wang Z. Mirza A.M. Iorio R.M. Virology. 1995; 209: 457-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), and a putative interaction site has been identified at stalk residues 89–94 (14Melanson V.R. Iorio R.M. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 13053-13061Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Two sialic acid binding sites have been identified in the globular head (28Crennell S. Takimoto T. Portner A. Taylor G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1068-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 32Zaitsev V. von Itzstein M. Groves D. Kiefel M. Takimoto T. Portner A. Taylor G. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 3733-3741Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In the NiV G ectodomain, the stalk is thought to encompass residues 71–188, with residue 189 being the membrane-proximal residue in the globular domain (33Bowden T.A. Aricescu A.R. Gilbert R.J. Grimes J.M. Jones E.Y. Stuart D.I. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 567-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). There are three cysteines in the stalk at positions 146, 158, and 162, which are thought to mediate disulfide-linked oligomer formation. Domains in the globular head region mediate binding to receptors ephrinB2 and B3 (33Bowden T.A. Aricescu A.R. Gilbert R.J. Grimes J.M. Jones E.Y. Stuart D.I. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 567-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 34Xu K. Rajashankar K.R. Chan Y.P. Himanen J.P. Broder C.C. Nikolov D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 9953-9958Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The domain(s) in NiV G that mediate the interaction with the homologous F protein has not been identified. The strategy for the construction of chimeras (HN-G) having NDV HN-derived stalks and NiV-derived heads is shown in Fig. 2B. The switch point in the chimeras is either at NDV HN residue 121 or residue 126 so that a chimera may or may not include the cysteine at position 123 of that protein. The globular segment derived from NiV G may begin at any of several residues between NiV G residues 140 and 188 so that the chimeras may include none, two, or all three of the cysteines in the membrane-distal end of the stalk of NiV G. The nomenclature for this series of chimeras indicates the most C-terminal HN-derived residue and the most N-terminal NiV G-derived residue. Thus, chimera 121HN-G149 has the N-terminal 121 residues from NDV HN and a C-terminal segment that begins at NiV G residue 149. To determine whether chimeras having NDV HN-derived stalks and G-derived terminal globular heads are transported to the cell surface, they were expressed in Vero cells, and the amount of each protein present at the cell surface was determined by flow cytometry using polyclonal antiserum to the G protein (Fig. 3A). All six of the chimeras tested were expressed more efficiently than the WT NiV G protein, which is set at 100%. The amounts of expression vary from 128% (chimera 126HN-G185) to 141% of WT (chimera 121HN-G188). Thus, the substitution of the stalk of HN for that of NiV G did not impair the ability of the attachment protein to be transported to the cell surface and may have actually enhanced it relative to that of the NiV G protein. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the presence of the HN-derived stalk may have increased the ability of antiserum to recognize the globular domain of G. We next wondered whether this series of chimeras retained the ability to bind to NiV receptors. This was tested by expressing the proteins in PK13 cells, which lack NiV receptors, and treating the monolayers with soluble ephrinB2 (Fig. 3B). Again, data are expressed relative to WT NiV G, which is set at 100%. One chimera, 121HN-G140 bound ephrinB2-human Fc to an extent similar to the WT protein. However, each of the other chimeras binds it significantly more efficiently than the WT NiV G protein, ranging from nearly 2-fold to almost 3-fold greater. Although these binding levels are not corrected for differences in expression, it is not likely that the increased receptor binding is due solely to the increased expression, because the latter is increased by less than 50% for each of the chimeras. Thus, in general, the replacement of the NiV G stalk with that from NDV HN significantly enhances the ability of the globular domain of G to bind ephrinB2. All of the HN-G chimera were tested for the ability to bind sialic acid receptors by assaying their hemadsorption activity using guinea pig erythrocytes. None of the chimeras exhibited detectable activity in this assay (data not shown). As controls, NDV HN exhibited extensive HAd activity, and NiV G was negative. To determine whether it is possible to trigger NDV F to promote fusion by binding to the NiV receptor, each member of the HN-G series of chimeras was tested for its ability to complement NDV F in the promotion of fusion in Vero cells (Fig. 3C). In this regard, the chimeras segregate into three groups. Surprisingly, three of the chimeras were capable of complementing NDV F more efficiently than WT HN. This was especially true of chimera 121HN-G149, which promoted fusion almost twice as efficiently as WT HN (187.3% of WT), but chimeras 126HN-G147 and 121HN-G166 also promoted fusion with NDV F more efficiently than WT HN. Two other chimeras, 121HN-G140 and 126HN-G185, promoted fusion with NDV F less efficiently than WT HN, 62.9% and 45.8% of WT, respectively. Finally, one chimera, 121HN-G188, did not complement NDV F for fusion at a detectable level, even though it is both expressed and binds ephrinB2 efficiently. As a control, NiV G did not complement NDV F for fusion at a detectable level. Also, none of the chimeras complemented the NiV F protein in fusion promotion (data not shown). Thus, several chimeras that bound ephrinB2 rather than sialic acid as receptor were capable of triggering NDV F to promote fusion. The oligomeric structure of the chimeras was analyzed by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions and by sucrose gradient sedimentation. For SDS-PAGE, the attachment proteins were expressed in Vero cells, radioactively labeled, and chased to the surface for 90 min in medium. Cells were lysed in the presence of N-ethylmaleimide, and the chimeric proteins were immunoprecipitated using antiserum 806 and resolved by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions (Fig. 4A). For comparison, the WT NDV-AV HN and NiV G proteins were also treated in the same way, although HN was immunoprecipitated with a mixture of HN-specific mAbs. The WT HN protein migrated as a mixture of monomers and dimers. The dimer is disulfide-linked through the cysteine at position 123 in the stalk (29Sheehan J.P. Iorio R.M. Syddall R.J. Glickman R.L. Bratt M.A. Virology. 1987; 161: 603-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 30Mirza A.M. Sheehan J.P. Hardy L.W. Glickman R.L. Iorio R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21425-21431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31McGinnes L.W. Morrison T.G. Virology. 1994; 200: 470-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The HN protein from this strain of NDV also possesses a cysteine residue in its cytoplasmic domain that can mediate disulfide-linked tetramer formation upon cell lysis (31McGinnes L.W. Morrison T.G. Virology. 1994; 200: 470-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, formation of this bond is prevented by the inclusion of an alkylating agent in the lysis buffer. Thus, NDV-AV HN is a non-disulfide-linked tetramer of disulfide-linked dimers (27Melanson V.R. Iorio R.M. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 623-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The NiV G protein migrated in the gel as a mixture of disulfide-linked dimers and tetramers with a lesser amount of monomer (Fig. 4A). The intermolecular disulfide bonds responsible for these oligomers are thought to be mediated by one or more of the cysteines at positions 146, 158, and 162 in the stalk region of NiV G. The first four chimeras in the series, in which the HN-derived segment terminates at HN residue 121, do not include NDV HN residue Cys-123 and migrated as a mixture of monomers, dimers, and tetramers, depending on the point at which the NiV G-derived segment begins. Chimeras 121HN-G166 and 121HN-G188 ran solely as monomers, consistent with their having none of the stalk cysteines from either HN or G. Finally, chimeras 126HN-G147 and 126HN-G185 both ran partially as dimers in non-reduced SDS-PAGE, although the former also exhibited tetramers on the gel (Fig. 4A). This is consistent with the presence of the cysteine in HN at position 123 that mediates disulfide-linked dimer formation in that protein. As expected, when the chimeras were electrophoresed in the presence of a reducing agent, they all ran exclusively as monomers, albeit with slightly different migration rates because of their different sizes (Fig. 4B). It is important to note that one of the chimeras (121HN-G166) that lacks all of the stalk cysteines from both proteins and ran exclusively as a monomer in non-reducing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4A) still promoted fusion with NDV F almost 30% more efficiently than WT HN (Fig. 3C), although, when normalized for expression and ephrinB2 binding, fusion was actually lower than that of WT HN. Because the SDS-PAGE migration pattern does not reflect the native oligomeric state, we compared the sucrose gradient sedimentation rate of this chimera to those of the WT NDV HN and NiV G proteins (Fig. 5). First of all, although both of the latter two proteins are tetrameric, NDV HN sedimented at a faster rate than NiV G. This likely means that the globular heads of the NDV tetramers are more tightly folded than those of NiV G. Most importantly, the sedimentation pattern of chimera 121HN-G166 (Fig. 5C) is noticeably different from that of either parent protein. Although a major population cosedimented with NiV G in fractions 11–17, there was a significant amount of a slower-sedimenting species in fractions 19–27. This suggests that some of the protein exists as dimers or possibly even monomers. For another chimera, 121HN-G149, only monomers and dimers were detected in non-reducing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4A). However, this chimera sedimented in the gradients at a rate very similar to that of NiV G, albeit without the disulfide-linked tetramers visible in the gradient gel (Fig. 5D). This suggests that, although the dimers of this chimera are not disulfide-linked, the protein is still tetrameric. Mab45 is a conformational monoclonal antibody whose binding to the NiV G protein is enhanced upon NiV G binding to ephrinB2 (18Aguilar H.C. Ataman Z.A. Aspericueta V. Fang A.Q. Stroud M. Negrete O.A. Kammerer R.A. Lee B. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 1628-1635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This enhancement represents increased binding to a domain thought to reside near the base of the globular domain distinct from the receptor binding site. This increased binding is postulated to be part of the fusion cascade in NiV G that results in the triggering of NiV F. To determine whether the triggering of the NDV F protein by the HN-G chimeras also involves this mAb"
https://openalex.org/W1986814711,"The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can be suppressed by highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) in the majority of infected patients. Nevertheless, treatment interruptions inevitably result in viral rebounds from persistent, latently infected cells, necessitating lifelong treatment. Virological failure due to resistance development is a frequent event and the major threat to treatment success. Currently, it is recommended to change treatment after the confirmation of virological failure. However, at the moment virological failure is detected, drug resistant mutants already replicate in great numbers. They infect numerous cells, many of which will turn into latently infected cells. This pool of cells represents an archive of resistance, which has the potential of limiting future treatment options. The objective of this study was to design a treatment strategy for treatment-naive patients that decreases the likelihood of early treatment failure and preserves future treatment options. We propose to apply a single, pro-active treatment switch, following a period of treatment with an induction regimen. The main goal of the induction regimen is to decrease the abundance of randomly generated mutants that confer resistance to the maintenance regimen, thereby increasing subsequent treatment success. Treatment is switched before the overgrowth and archiving of mutant strains that carry resistance against the induction regimen and would limit its future re-use. In silico modelling shows that an optimal trade-off is achieved by switching treatment at days after the initiation of antiviral therapy. Evaluation of the proposed treatment strategy demonstrated significant improvements in terms of resistance archiving and virological response, as compared to conventional HAART. While continuous pro-active treatment alternation improved the clinical outcome in a randomized trial, our results indicate that a similar improvement might also be reached after a single pro-active treatment switch. The clinical validity of this finding, however, remains to be shown by a corresponding trial."

Here, we identify FYVE-CENT (ZFYVE26), a phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate binding protein important for cytokinesis, as a novel interacting protein of Beclin 1. A mutation in FYVE-CENT (R1945Q) associated with breast cancer abolished the interaction between FYVE-CENT and Beclin 1, and reduced the localization of these proteins at the intercellular bridge during cytokinesis. Breast cancer cells containing the FYVE-CENT R1945Q mutation displayed a significant increase in cytokinetic profiles and bi - multinuclear phenotype. Both Beclin 1 and FYVE-CENT were found to be downregulated in advanced breast cancers. These findings suggest a positive feedback loop for recruitment of FYVE-CENT and Beclin 1 to the intercellular bridge during cytokinesis, and reveal a novel potential tumor suppressor mechanism for Beclin 1."

IntroductionEnzymes may have evolved from simpler catalysts that lowered the enthalpy of activation (ΔH‡) of biologically important reactions in the primitive earth. Thus, it is of interest to compare the thermodynamic basis of the rate enhancements produced by enzymes with the thermodynamic basis of the rate enhancements produced by small inorganic catalysts (1Stockbridge R.B.

Even today, PPi-dependent proton pumps, sodium pumps, and kinases are found in some bacteria (3Hedlund J. Cantoni R. Baltscheffsky M. Baltscheffsky H. Persson B.

PPi hydrolysis plays an important role in the metabolism of modern organisms by removing the PPi that is generated by biosynthetic reactions such as the synthesis of aminoacyl-tRNA. The enzyme (inorganic pyrophosphatase (PPase)) that catalyzes this reaction has an unusual active site that has been termed “mini-mineral,” in that metal ions and structural water molecules appear to be largely responsible for catalysis (6Cooperman B.S.

This enzyme furnishes an opportunity to compare the proficiency of an enzyme that catalyzes one of the simpler reactions in biology with the proficiencies of primitive catalysts that model some of the key chemical features of the modern enzyme's active site.Two classes of PPases have been identified, and the tertiary structures of Type I PPases (found in eukaryotes and Escherichia coli) differ significantly from those of Type II PPases (found in some bacteria), suggesting that these two classes evolved independently (7Shintani T.

First, the extremely polar active site neutralizes the charged PPi substrate so that the nucleophile can approach. A crystal structure of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Type I enzyme complex with two bound phosphate ions shows that the oxygen atoms of the two phosphate groups are coordinated by six hydrogen bonds to water, six bonds to the metal ions, and six hydrogen bonds to protein side chains (10Heikinheimo P.

In the Bacillus subtilis Type II enzyme with the substrate analog imidodiphosphate, all three nonbridging oxygen atoms of the phosphoryl group that undergoes attack by water are bound to a Mn2+ ion (9Fabrichniy I.P. Lehtiö L. Tammenkoski M. Zyryanov A.B. Oksanen E. Baykov A.A. Lahti R. Goldman A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 1422-1431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Second, metal ions coordinate the substrate water molecule, decreasing its pKa value and rendering it more effective as a nucleophile at ordinary pH values. In Type I PPases, the substrate water molecule bridges two metal ions (10Heikinheimo P. Lehtonen J. Baykov A. Lahti R. Cooperman B.S. Goldman A. Structure. 1996; 4: 1491-1508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), whereas in Type II PPases, the substrate water molecule resides in the center of a plane formed by three metal ions (9Fabrichniy I.P. Lehtiö L. Tammenkoski M. Zyryanov A.B. Oksanen E. Baykov A.A. Lahti R. Goldman A. J. Biol.

Of the 14 conserved residues shared by Type I PPases, only two aspartic acid residues decreased kcat by more than ∼100-fold when mutated to alanine, and both of those mutations eliminated binding of the two structural Mg2+ ions (11Pohjanjoki P. Lahti R. Goldman A. Cooperman B.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1754-1761Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A water molecule appears to act as a general acid by protonating the leaving phosphoryl group (9Fabrichniy I.P. Lehtiö L. Tammenkoski M. Zyryanov A.B. Oksanen E. Baykov A.A. Lahti R. Goldman A. J.

Thus, PPase may constitute an extreme case in which metal ions and water molecules play a direct role in catalysis, whereas the protein moiety serves mainly as a scaffold for organizing the system.In principle, it does not seem obvious that a protein-based active site could not accelerate PPi hydrolysis. Kinases and phosphatases both require metal ions (generally one and two, respectively), yet these enzymes (which are structurally unrelated to PPases) employ protein side chains as catalytic bases, nucleophiles, or electrostatic catalysts (12Knowles J.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 877-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar). The apparently convergent evolution of Type I and II PPases suggests that, in this special case, a primitive mini-mineral catalytic site might suffice to catalyze PPi hydrolysis.In this work, we sought to determine the magnitude and thermodynamic origin of the rate enhancements produced by E. coli PPase and by simple inorganic catalyst models of the enzyme's inorganic core. We compared the intrinsic reactivities of PPi4−, PPi3−, PPi2−, and MgPPi2− (the true substrate for PPase) (13Cooperman B.S. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 526-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We also determined the rate constants and activation parameters for the hydrolysis of PPi by E. coli PPase. In addition, we examined the rate of PPi hydrolysis in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), a dipolar aprotic solvent chosen to explore the effect of transferring this substrate from solvent water to a somewhat polar nonaqueous environment. IntroductionEnzymes may have evolved from simpler catalysts that lowered the enthalpy of activation (ΔH‡) of biologically important reactions in the primitive earth. Thus, it is of interest to compare the thermodynamic basis of the rate enhancements produced by enzymes with the thermodynamic basis of the rate enhancements produced by small inorganic catalysts (1Stockbridge R.B.

Even today, PPi-dependent proton pumps, sodium pumps, and kinases are found in some bacteria (3Hedlund J. Cantoni R. Baltscheffsky M. Baltscheffsky H. Persson B.

PPi hydrolysis plays an important role in the metabolism of modern organisms by removing the PPi that is generated by biosynthetic reactions such as the synthesis of aminoacyl-tRNA. The enzyme (inorganic pyrophosphatase (PPase)) that catalyzes this reaction has an unusual active site that has been termed “mini-mineral,” in that metal ions and structural water molecules appear to be largely responsible for catalysis (6Cooperman B.S.

This enzyme furnishes an opportunity to compare the proficiency of an enzyme that catalyzes one of the simpler reactions in biology with the proficiencies of primitive catalysts that model some of the key chemical features of the modern enzyme's active site.Two classes of PPases have been identified, and the tertiary structures of Type I PPases (found in eukaryotes and Escherichia coli) differ significantly from those of Type II PPases (found in some bacteria), suggesting that these two classes evolved independently (7Shintani T.

https://openalex.org/W2132928628,"Cdc42 of the Rho GTPase family has been implicated in cell actin organization, proliferation, survival, and migration but its physiological role is likely cell-type specific. By a T cell-specific deletion of Cdc42 in mouse, we have recently shown that Cdc42 maintains naïve T cell homeostasis through promoting cell survival and suppressing T cell activation. Here we have further investigated the involvement of Cdc42 in multiple stages of T cell differentiation. We found that in Cdc42−/− thymus, positive selection of CD4+CD8+ double-positive thymocytes was defective, CD4+ and CD8+ single-positive thymocytes were impaired in migration and showed an increase in cell apoptosis triggered by anti-CD3/-CD28 antibodies, and thymocytes were hyporesponsive to anti-CD3/-CD28-induced cell proliferation and hyperresponsive to anti-CD3/-CD28-stimulated MAP kinase activation. At the periphery, Cdc42-deficient naive T cells displayed an impaired actin polymerization and TCR clustering during the formation of mature immunological synapse, and showed an enhanced differentiation to Th1 and CD8+ effector and memory cells in vitro and in vivo. Finally, Cdc42−/− mice exhibited exacerbated liver damage in an induced autoimmune disease model. Collectively, these data establish that Cdc42 is critically involved in thymopoiesis and plays a restrictive role in effector and memory T cell differentiation and autoimmunity."
https://openalex.org/W1977919788,"Modification of proteins of the translational apparatus is common in many organisms. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we provide evidence for the methylation of Rpl1ab, a well conserved protein forming the ribosomal L1 protuberance of the large subunit that functions in the release of tRNA from the exit site. We show that the intact mass of Rpl1ab is 14 Da larger than its calculated mass with the previously described loss of the initiator methionine residue and N-terminal acetylation. We determined that the increase in mass of yeast Rpl1ab is consistent with the addition of a methyl group to lysine 46 using top-down mass spectrometry. Lysine modification was confirmed by detecting 3H-N-ϵ-monomethyllysine in hydrolysates of Rpl1ab purified from yeast cells radiolabeled in vivo with S-adenosyl-l-[methyl-3H]methionine. Mass spectrometric analysis of intact Rpl1ab purified from 37 deletion strains of known and putative yeast methyltransferases revealed that only the deletion of the YLR137W gene, encoding a seven-β-strand methyltransferase, results in the loss of the +14-Da modification. We expressed the YLR137W gene as a His-tagged protein in Escherichia coli and showed that it catalyzes N-ϵ-monomethyllysine formation within Rpl1ab on ribosomes from the ΔYLR137W mutant strain lacking the methyltransferase activity but not from wild-type ribosomes. We also showed that the His-tagged protein could catalyze monomethyllysine formation on a 16-residue peptide corresponding to residues 38–53 of Rpl1ab. We propose that the YLR137W gene be given the standard name RKM5 (ribosomal lysine (K) methyltransferase 5). Orthologs of RKM5 are found only in fungal species, suggesting a role unique to their survival. Modification of proteins of the translational apparatus is common in many organisms.

These modifications are known to enhance resistance to ribosome-targeting antibiotics, facilitate ribosomal protein transport into and out of the nucleus, allow efficient ribosomal assembly, and increase translational accuracy (1Polevoda B.

Previous efforts have identified modifications within proteins of the large ribosomal subunit. Interestingly, mass spectrometric analysis suggested that six proteins, Rpl1ab, Rpl3, Rpl12ab, Rpl23ab, Rpl42ab, and Rpl43ab, 3Yeast ribosomal proteins are identified based on the gene designation. In cases where two genes encode identical protein products, the protein is designated “ab.” For example, the Rpl1ab protein is the identical translation product of the RPL1A and RPL1B genes. were subject to methylation (18Lee S.W.

Further analysis has localized the methylation sites on four of these proteins. Rpl3 is modified to form a 3-methylhistidine residue at position 243 (13Webb K.J. Zurita-Lopez C.I. Al-Hadid Q. Laganowsky A. Young B.D. Lipson R.S. Souda P. Faull K.F. Whitelegge J.P. Clarke S.G. J. Biol.

The proposed methylation at Rpl43ab has not been observed to date in our studies. The only protein remaining to be analyzed is Rpl1ab.In this work, we demonstrate that Rpl1ab from S. cerevisiae is modified at lysine 46 by the addition of a single methyl group. This protein is a member of the ribosomal L1 family that is conserved in most organisms and forms the “L1 protuberance” that is involved in tRNA exit from the E site of the large subunit (20Petitjean A.

This protein binds not only the large subunit rRNA, but its own mRNA, the latter presumably in a regulatory role (21Nikulin A. Eliseikina I. Tishchenko S. Nevskaya N. Davydova N. Platonova O.

Interestingly, the protein structure appears to be flexible; no clear electron density is seen for L1 in the 2.4 Å map of the large subunit from the archaeon Haloarcula marismortui (24Ban N. Nissen P. Hansen J. Moore P.B. Steitz T.A. Science. 2000; 289: 905-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (2777) Google Scholar). We show here that methylation of the yeast L1 protein is absent in a deletion mutant of the putative seven-β-strand methyltransferase encoded by the YLR137W gene. We show that the expressed YLR137W protein can catalyze N-ϵ-monomethyllysine formation in yeast ribosomes containing unmethylated Rpl1ab and in a synthetic peptide corresponding to the methylated region on Rpl1ab. To date, most protein lysine methyltransferases have been identified as members of the SET domain methyltransferase family. However, the YLR137W gene product, now designated Rkm5, now joins four other protein lysine methyltransferases of the seven-β-strand superfamily: the Dot1 methyltransferase acting on histone H3 (25Feng Q.

Structure. 2008; 16: 1059-1066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONThe Rpl1ab protein in yeast is a member of the highly conserved L1 ribosomal protein family. These proteins form the L1 protuberance, an extension from the large ribosomal subunit that is suggested to facilitate the exit of the tRNA from the E site (22Cornish P.V. Ermolenko D.N. Staple D.W. Hoang L. Hickerson R.P. Noller H.F. Ha T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 2571-2576Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Although there is no high resolution structure of the yeast ribosome, it is possible to estimate the three-dimensional site of the lysine 46 modification by studying the known structures of bacterial (23Nevskaya N. Tishchenko S. Volchkov S. Kljashtorny V. Nikonova E. Nikonov O. Nikulin A. Köhrer C. Piendl W. Zimmermann R. Stockley P. Garber M. Nikonov S. J. Mol.

Zimmermann R. Garber M. Nikonov S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 104-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) L1 proteins in complex with rRNA. Although the lysine 46 residue of yeast Rpl1ab is not generally conserved in prokaryotes, its position has been established between the first and second β-strands, away from the RNA binding interfaces (21Nikulin A. Eliseikina I. Tishchenko S. Nevskaya N. Davydova N. Platonova O. Piendl W. Selmer M. Liljas A. Drygin D. Zimmermann R. Garber M. Nikonov S. Nat. Struct.

This suggests that the side chain of lysine 46 of Rpl1ab may be accessible on the surface of the ribosome, in contrast to the methylated lysine residues of yeast Rpl23ab (19Porras-Yakushi T.R. Whitelegge J.P. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35835-35845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and Rpl42ab (9Webb K.J. Laganowsky A. Whitelegge J.P. Clarke S.G. J.

Laganowsky A. Young B.D. Lipson R.S. Souda P. Faull K.F. Whitelegge J.P. Clarke S.G. J. Biol.

Interestingly, the lysine 46 residue and its surrounding sequence is well conserved in the mammalian L1 ortholog, Rpl10A. It is not clear whether the mammalian protein might also be subject to methylation.The Rkm5 methyltransferase joins a growing family of enzymes of the seven-β-strand class (32Petrossian T. Clarke S. Epigenomics. 2009; 1: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 39Petrossian T.C. Clarke S.G. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2009; 8: 1516-1526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) that catalyze protein lysine methylation. Until recently, nearly all of the protein lysine methyltransferases were of the SET domain class, with the key exception being the Dot1 enzyme that was responsible for the trimethylation of Lys-79 in histone H3 (25Feng Q. Wang H. Ng H.H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Struhl K. Zhang Y. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1052-1058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar, 26van Leeuwen F. Gafken P.R. Gottschling D.E. Cell. 2002; 109: 745-756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Others have now identified seven-β-strand enzymes that catalyze the trimethylation and dimethylation of lysine residues in calmodulin (27Magnani R. Dirk L.M. Trievel R.C. Houtz R.L. Nat. Commun. 2010; 1: 43Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and elongation factor 1A (17Lipson R.S. Webb K.J. Clarke S.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2010; 500: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), respectively. Additionally, evidence has been presented that PrmA, the seven-β-strand methyltransferase responsible for the N-terminal methylation of prokaryotic ribosomal protein L11, also catalyzes trimethylation of lysine residues at two sites within the polypeptide (28Demirci H. Gregory S.T. Dahlberg A.E. Jogl G. Structure. 2008; 16: 1059-1066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We analyzed the amino acid sequences surrounding the methylated lysine residue in each of these proteins and did not identify any common sequence motifs that might serve as recognition sequences for seven β-strand protein lysine methyltransferases (data not shown). It is clear, however, that protein lysine methylation is catalyzed by members of both the SET domain and seven-β-strand methyltransferase superfamilies.Interestingly, protein lysine methylation appears to be more common in fungal species than in mammalian species, at least for ribosomal proteins of the large subunit (Table 1). Notably, there are no mammalian orthologs of any of the five yeast ribosomal large subunit protein lysine methyltransferases described to date (Table 1). Moreover, none of the human orthologs of the methylated yeast Rpl1ab, Rpl12ab, Rpl23ab, and Rpl42ab proteins appear to be modified (41Odintsova T.I. Müller E.C. Ivanov A.V. Egorov T.A. Bienert R. Valdimirov S.N. Kostka S. Otto A. Wittmann-Liebold B. Karpova G.G. J. Protein Chem. 2003; 22: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The only human large subunit ribosomal protein known to be modified by lysine methylation is L29 (41Odintsova T.I. Müller E.C. Ivanov A.V. Egorov T.A. Bienert R. Valdimirov S.N. Kostka S. Otto A.

In rat ribosomes, protein lysine methylation has been detected in both L29 and L40 (42Williamson N.A. Raliegh J. Morrice N.A. Wettenhall R.E. Eur. J.

In the bacterium E. coli, the L11 protein (the ortholog of yeast Rpl12ab) is methylated at lysine 3 (the equivalent position methylated in plants and yeast) and at one additional nonconserved site (lysine 39) by the PrmA methyltransferase (44Vanet A. Plumbridge J.A. Guérin M.F. Alix J.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 947-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This enzyme, however, shows little or no similarity to the yeast ribosomal lysine methyltransferase Rkm5 except within the general motifs I, post-I, II, and III, common to all seven β-strand methyltransferases. In fact, the closest match of E. coli PrmA in S. cerevisiae is Rmt1 protein arginine methyltransferase. Ribosomal protein L12 in E. coli is also methylated at a lysine residue (45Arnold R.J. Reilly J.P. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 269: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar); there is no yeast cytoplasmic ortholog of this protein. These results demonstrate that protein lysine methylation on the large ribosomal subunit is largely idiosyncratic in nature with little in common between more distinct groups of organisms despite the similarity in the protein sequences themselves.The role of protein lysine methylation of ribosomal proteins is unclear. Some information is available from the phenotype of yeast cells lacking specific protein lysine methyltransferases. Yeast cells lacking the YLR137W/Rkm5 methyltransferase are viable and do not yet have a clear phenotype. When grown in a competition with a parent strain in minimal medium, the YLR137W knock-out shows a slight growth advantage (relative fitness score is 1.003) (46Breslow D.K. Cameron D.M. Collins S.R.

In both S. cerevisiae and S. pombe, cells lacking methylation at lysine 55 of Rpl42 are more sensitive to cycloheximide (9Webb K.J. Laganowsky A. Whitelegge J.P. Clarke S.G. J. Biol.

Nakayama J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 22448-22460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The growth defect in S. pombe resulting from the overexpression of the enzyme responsible for lysine 3 methylation of Rpl12, as well as the nucleolar localization of the enzyme, suggests a role for methylation in ribosomal assembly.

Methodology/Principal Findings Since the final epidemic size, the proportion of individuals in a population who become infected during an epidemic, is not the result of a binomial sampling process because infection events are not independent of each other, we propose the use of an asymptotic distribution of the final size to compute approximate 95% confidence intervals of the observed final size. This allows the comparison of the observed final sizes against predictions based on the modeling study (R = 1.15, 1.40 and 1.90), which also yields simple formulae for determining sample sizes for future seroepidemiological studies. We examine a total of eleven published seroepidemiological studies of H1N1-2009 that took place after observing the peak incidence in a number of countries. Observed seropositive proportions in six studies appear to be smaller than that predicted from R = 1.40; four of the six studies sampled serum less than one month after the reported peak incidence. The comparison of the observed final sizes against R = 1.15 and 1.90 reveals that all eleven studies appear not to be significantly deviating from the prediction with R = 1.15, but final sizes in nine studies indicate overestimation if the value R = 1.90 is used. Conclusions Sample sizes of published seroepidemiological studies were too small to assess the validity of model predictions except when R = 1.90 was used. We recommend the use of the proposed approach in determining the sample size of post-epidemic seroepidemiological studies, calculating the 95% confidence interval of observed final size, and conducting relevant hypothesis testing instead of the use of methods that rely on a binomial proportion."
https://openalex.org/W2089778014,"The normal progression of the cell cycle requires sequential expression of cyclins. Rapid induction of cyclin D1 and its associated binding with cyclin-dependent kinases, in the presence or absence of mitogenic signals, often is considered a rate-limiting step during cell cycle progression through the G(1) phase.In the present study, human umbilical cord blood stem cells (hUCBSC) in co-cultures with glioblastoma cells (U251 and 5310) not only induced G(0)-G(1) phase arrest, but also reduced the number of cells at S and G(2)-M phases of cell cycle. Cell cycle regulatory proteins showed decreased expression levels upon treatment with hUCBSC as revealed by Western and FACS analyses. Inhibition of cyclin D1 activity by hUCBSC treatment is sufficient to abolish the expression levels of Cdk 4, Cdk 6, cyclin B1, β-Catenin levels. Our immuno precipitation experiments present evidence that, treatment of glioma cells with hUCBSC leads to the arrest of cell-cycle progression through inactivation of both cyclin D1/Cdk 4 and cyclin D1/Cdk 6 complexes. It is observed that hUCBSC, when co-cultured with glioma cells, caused an increased G(0)-G(1) phase despite the reduction of G(0)-G(1) regulatory proteins cyclin D1 and Cdk 4. We found that this reduction of G(0)-G(1) regulatory proteins, cyclin D1 and Cdk 4 may be in part compensated by the expression of cyclin E1, when co-cultured with hUCBSC. Co-localization experiments under in vivo conditions in nude mice brain xenografts with cyclin D1 and CD81 antibodies demonstrated, decreased expression of cyclin D1 in the presence of hUCBSC.This paper elucidates a model to regulate glioma cell cycle progression in which hUCBSC acts to control cyclin D1 induction and in concert its partner kinases, Cdk 4 and Cdk 6 by mediating cell cycle arrest at G(0)-G(1) phase."
https://openalex.org/W1992327883,"Protein kinase A-anchoring proteins (AKAPs) influence fundamental cellular processes by directing the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) toward its intended substrates. In this report we describe the identification and characterization of a ternary complex of AKAP220, the PKA holoenzyme, and the IQ domain GTPase-activating protein 2 isoform (IQGAP2) that is enriched at cortical regions of the cell. Formation of an IQGAP2-AKAP220 core complex initiates a subsequent phase of protein recruitment that includes the small GTPase Rac. Biochemical and molecular biology approaches reveal that PKA phosphorylation of Thr-716 on IQGAP2 enhances association with the active form of the Rac GTPase. Cell-based experiments indicate that overexpression of an IQGAP2 phosphomimetic mutant (IQGAP2 T716D) enhances the formation of actin-rich membrane ruffles at the periphery of HEK 293 cells. In contrast, expression of a nonphosphorylatable IQGAP2 T716A mutant or gene silencing of AKAP220 suppresses formation of membrane ruffles. These findings imply that IQGAP2 and AKAP220 act synergistically to sustain PKA-mediated recruitment of effectors such as Rac GTPases that impact the actin cytoskeleton."
https://openalex.org/W2076834153,"Enhancing the affinity of therapeutic T cell receptors (TCR) without altering their specificity is a significant challenge for adoptive immunotherapy. Current efforts have primarily relied on empirical approaches. Here, we used structural analyses to identify a glycine-serine variation in the TCR that modulates antigen sensitivity. A G at position 107 within the CDR3β stalk is encoded within a single mouse and human TCR, TRBV13-2 and TRBV12-5 respectively. Most TCR bear a S107. The S hydroxymethyl side chain intercalates into the core of the CDR3β loop, stabilizing it. G107 TRBV possess a gap in their CDR3β where this S hydroxymethyl moiety would fit. We predicted based on modeling and molecular dynamics simulations that a G107S substitution would increase CDR3β stability and thereby augment receptor sensitivity. Experimentally, a G107S replacement led to an ∼10-1000 fold enhanced antigen sensitivity in 3 of 4 TRBV13-2(+) TCR tested. Analysis of fine specificity indicated a preserved binding orientation. These results support the feasibility of developing high affinity antigen specific TCR for therapeutic purposes through the identification and manipulation of critical framework residues. They further indicate that amino acid variations within TRBV not directly involved in ligand contact can program TCR sensitivity, and suggest a role for CDR3 stability in this programming."
https://openalex.org/W2089441065,"CAPRI is a member of the GAP1 family of GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) for small G proteins. It is known to function as an amplitude sensor for intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels stimulated by extracellular signals and has a catalytic domain with dual RasGAP and RapGAP activities. Here, we have investigated the mechanism that switches CAPRI between its two GAP activities. We demonstrate that CAPRI forms homodimers <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner. The site required for dimerization was pinpointed by deletion and point mutations to a helix motif that forms a hydrophobic face in the extreme C-terminal tail of the CAPRI protein. Deletion of this helix motif abolished dimer formation but did not affect translocation of CAPRI to the plasma membrane upon cell stimulation with histamine. We found that dimeric and monomeric CAPRI coexist in cells and that the ratio of dimeric to monomeric CAPRI increases upon cell stimulation with histamine. Free Ca<sup>2+</sup> at physiologically relevant concentrations was both necessary and sufficient for dimer formation. Importantly, the monomeric and dimeric forms of CAPRI exhibited differential GAP activities <i>in vivo</i>; the wild-type form of CAPRI had stronger RapGAP activity than RasGAP activity, whereas a monomeric CAPRI mutant showed stronger RasGAP than RapGAP activity. These results demonstrate that CAPRI switches between its dual GAP roles by forming monomers or homodimers through a process regulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup>. We propose that Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent dimerization of CAPRI may serve to coordinate Ras and Rap1 signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2079200708,"Transmembrane adaptor proteins (TRAPs) are important organizers and regulators of immunoreceptor-mediated signaling. A bioinformatic search revealed several potential novel TRAPs, including a highly conserved protein, proline rich 7 (PRR7), previously described as a component of the PSD-95/N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor protein complex in postsynaptic densities (PSD) of rat neurons. Our data demonstrate that PRR7 is weakly expressed in other tissues but is readily up-regulated in activated human peripheral blood lymphocytes. Transient overexpression of PRR7 in Jurkat T cell line led to gradual apoptotic death dependent on the WW domain binding motif surrounding Tyr-166 in the intracellular part of PRR7. To circumvent the pro-apoptotic effect of PRR7, we generated Jurkat clones with inducible expression of PRR7 (J-iPRR7). In these cells acute induction of PRR7 expression had a dual effect. It resulted in up-regulation of the transcription factor c-Jun and the activation marker CD69 as well as enhanced production of IL-2 after phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and ionomycin treatment. On the other hand, expression of PRR7 inhibited general tyrosine phosphorylation and calcium influx after T cell receptor cross-linking by antibodies. Moreover, we found PRR7 constitutively tyrosine-phosphorylated and associated with Src.

All of these proteins are composed of a short N-terminal extracellular peptide, a single transmembrane segment, and a cytoplasmic part containing multiple tyrosine and other protein interaction motifs. In the case of the raft-associated proteins, a palmitoylation motif (CXXC or CXC) lies between the transmembrane segment and the intracellular part (14Horejsí V. Immunol. Lett. 2004; 92: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). TRAPs play positive and negative regulatory roles in immunoreceptor signaling. The most prominent role is played by LAT, which is essential for several aspects of TCR signaling and plays an important role in the immunoreceptor signaling in other leukocyte subsets (15Horejsí V. Otáhal P. Brdicka T. FEBS J. 2010; 277: 4383-4397Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In addition, experiments on genetic models have assigned important regulatory functions to other members of TRAP family, including NTAL, LAX, TRIM, and SIT (16Fuller D.M. Zhang W. Immunol. Rev. 2009; 232: 72-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 17Koelsch U. Schraven B. Simeoni L. J. Immunol. 2008; 181: 5930-5939Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In an effort to discover additional TRAPs of functional importance, we performed an in silico search for proteins possessing the features characteristic of known TRAPs. Among 149 candidate genes, one of the best hits was PRR7. Previously, PRR7 was identified in the PSD fraction of rat forebrain tissue by a proteomic approach (18Murata Y. Doi T. Taniguchi H. Fujiyoshi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 327: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). It was shown to associate with PSD-95 (via a PDZ domain binding motif) and was found in a protein complex containing the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor subunits NR1 and NR2B. These biochemical data suggested that PRR7 could be potentially involved in modulation of neural activities. In the present study we found that PRR7 is weakly expressed in many other tissues, including immune cells, and is up-regulated during T cell activation. Moreover, we show that PRR7 overexpression in Jurkat cells substantially affected TCR signaling and cell survival. The in silico search in human genome (USCS build hg16) for proteins possessing the features characteristic of known TRAPs was done with following parameters: a short extracellular N-terminal sequence, a single hydrophobic sequence starting at amino acids (aa) 5–50 (prediction using TMHMM Version 2.0) (19Krogh A. Larsson B. von Heijne G. Sonnhammer E.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar), a palmitoylation motif at aa 20–60 (CXC or CXXC), tyrosine-based phosphorylation motifs (YXX(I/L/V/A)) and/or C-terminal Group I PDZ binding motifs ((S/T)X(L/V)). RNA was isolated using a Mini RNA purification kit (Zymo Research, Orange, CA) or TRI Reagent RT (MRC, Cincinnati, OH). Contaminating DNA was removed using a DNAfree kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). A human normal tissue FirstChoice RNA Survey Panel and a lymph node FirstChoice Total RNA were purchased from Ambion. Human hippocampal RNA was purchased from BioChain Institute (Hayward, CA). Total RNA (1 μg) was transcribed using SuperScript III RT (Invitrogen) with a combination of random pentadecamer and anchored oligo(dT)20 primers. RT-qPCR was performed using a LightCycler 480 SYBR Green I Master chemistry (Roche Applied Science) and an amount of cDNA equivalent to 20 ng of total RNA. Primers specific for human PRR7 were 5′-tgtccagtgaagcgtctgag-3′ (forward) and 5′-aagcacgtgaggaacgtgta-3′ (reverse). Raw RT-qPCR data (Ct values) were preprocessed (normalization to optimal reference genes, GAPDH or β-microglobulin, relative expression calculation) and analyzed using GenEx Software (MultiD, Göteborg, Sweden). Total RNA was isolated from 1 × 107 cells using TRI Reagent RT. RNA was resolved (15 μg/sample) by formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis, transferred to positively charged nylon membrane, and hybridized to radioactively ([α-32P]dCTP)-labeled probe in Super Hyb solution (MRC). The probe was prepared from cloned PRR7 cDNA using DecaLabel DNA labeling kit (Fermentas, Ontario, Canada). Cell line MEG-01 was provided by S. Watson (University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK), MOLT-4 and HPB-ALL were from the IMG cell line collection (Institute of Molecular Genetics, Prague, Czech Republic), and Caco-2, U937, and THP-1 were from DSMZ (Braunschweig, Germany). Jurkat, Ramos, and COS-7 cell lines were from ATCC (Manassas, VA), and HEK293FT cells were obtained from Invitrogen. Caco-2, HEK293FT, and COS-7 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS (Biochrom AG, Berlin, Germany) and antibiotics at 37 °C in 5% CO2. All other cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FCS and antibiotics at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) were isolated from whole blood of healthy donors by Ficoll-Paque Plus (GE Healthcare) gradient centrifugation. For depletion of adherent cells, PBL were subjected to plastic adherence for 2 h at 37 °C. PBL were cultured as stated above for Jurkat cells. The coding region of human PRR7 was amplified from human T cell line MOLT-4 cDNA and inserted into mammalian expression plasmid pEFIRES-P, provided by Dr. S.

For inducible expression, PRR7 was subcloned into the pZX-LR vector in-frame with the hemagglutinin (HA) tag. The pZX-LR vector was a kind gift of Dr. Claude Labrie (CHUL Research Center, Quebec, Canada) (21Lessard J. Aicha S.B. Fournier A. Calvo E. Lavergne E. Pelletier M. Labrie C.

Deletion mutants of PRR7 (Δ2–39, Δ44–274, Δ114–274, Δ151–274, Δ159–274, Δ171–274, Δ207–274, ΔTAV) were generated by PCR and fused to enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) in the pEGFP vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). A tyrosine mutant of PRR7 (all Tyr residues mutated to Phe) was generated by sequential PCR oligonucleotide-directed site-specific mutagenesis and subcloned into the pEGFP vector (Clontech). For co-transfection experiments in COS-7 cells, the following cDNA constructs were used: Src in the pSM vector provided by Dr. A. Weiss (University of California, San Francisco, CA), FLAG-tagged Lck inserted into the pcDNA3 vector provided by Dr. R. Abraham (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN), FynT and FynF (constitutively active Fyn) in the pEF-BOS vector provided by Dr. B.

Watson (University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK), FLAG-tagged Hck in the pcDNA1 vector provided by Dr. G. Langsley (Institut Pasteur, Paris, France). Hybridomas producing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs, TRAP-3/01–13) to human PRR7 were prepared by standard hybridoma techniques using mice immunized with the recombinant protein corresponding to aa 147–274. Using the deletion mutants, the epitope recognized by the mAbs was mapped to the stretch of aa 147–170. The mAbs were cross-reactive with murine and rat PRR7 in immunoblots (not shown). The phosphotyrosine antibody (P-TYR-02) used for detection of phospho-LAT in Jurkat whole cell lysates was developed in our laboratory as well. For cell stimulation, the following non-commercial antibodies were used: C305 IgM mAb to Jurkat cell TCR provided by Dr. A. Weiss and 248.23.2 IgM mAb to CD28 (22Qiao L. Schürmann G. Betzler M.

The following inhibitors were used: the inhibitor of the Src family kinases, PP2 (Calbiochem), final concentration 10 μm and the pan-caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-FMK (Alexis Biochemicals), final concentration 10 μm. Z-VAD-FMK inhibitor assay was performed using 2.5 × 105 cells in 96-well tissue culture plates in triplicates. Viability was assessed by flow cytometry (propidium iodide exclusion and side plus forward scatter gating). Jurkat cells (107) were transfected with 15 μg of the corresponding plasmid DNA in 300 μl of RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FCS by electroporation (250 V, 950 microfarads) using a GenePulser electroporator (Bio-Rad). For the pZRD-inducible system (21Lessard J. Aicha S.B. Fournier A. Calvo E. Lavergne E. Pelletier M. Labrie C. Prostate. 2007; 67: 808-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), based on the RheoSwitch Mammalian Inducible Expression System (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA), transfectants were selected in the culture medium containing Zeocin (200 μg/ml, Invitrogen). Stably transfected GFP-positive cells were sorted and further subcloned by limiting dilution. The clones (denoted J-iPRR7) that expressed PRR7 only after induction with RSL1 (500 nm for maximal induction, RheoSwitch Ligand 1, New England Biolabs) were used in further experiments. COS-7 cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To analyze PRR7 up-regulation, freshly isolated PBL were stimulated using 1) anti-CD3 IgG (MEM-57) immobilized on tissue culture plastic (10 μg/ml) and soluble anti-CD28 IgM (100× diluted hybridoma supernatant), 2) PHA-L (2.5 μg/ml, Sigma), and 3) a combination of PMA (10 ng/ml, Sigma) and ionomycin (500 ng/ml, Sigma). For short term activation (Ca2+ flux, phospho-Tyr blots), Jurkat cells were stimulated with anti-TCR IgM (C305) (23Fraser J.D. Goldsmith M.A. Weiss A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

For activation of Jurkat cells in an IL-2 production assay, the combination of PMA and ionomycin was used as described above. Generally, 5 × 107 cells were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm iodoacetamide, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm Na4P2O7, 10% v/v glycerol, and Protease Inhibitor Mixture III, Calbiochem) containing 1% w/v detergent LM (Calbiochem) or Brij-98 (Sigma) for 30 min on ice. To remove nuclei and other insoluble materials, the lysate was spun down at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Density gradient ultracentrifugation and gel filtration on Sepharose 4B were performed as previously described (24Otáhal P. Angelisová P. Hrdinka M. Brdicka T. Novák P. Drbal K. Horejsí V. J. Immunol. 2010; 184: 3689-3696Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation experiments, we coupled the anti-PRR7 IgG (TRAP3-03) to CNBr-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) or used soluble antibodies and Protein A/G PLUS-agarose IP Reagent (Santa Cruz). Palmitoylation of PRR7 was examined using the acyl-biotinyl exchange chemistry-based method (25Wan J. Roth A.F. Bailey A.O. Davis N.G. Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 1573-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Briefly, plasma membranes from 5 × 107 cells were isolated, and palmitate protein modifications were removed by hydroxylamine and replaced with biotin. Biotinylated proteins were then immunoprecipitated on streptavidin-agarose beads. Other biochemical methods (SDS-PAGE, immunoblotting) were performed essentially as described before (4Brdicka T.

Jurkat cells were allowed to adhere to polylysine-coated coverslips for 30 min, then fixed with 4% w/v formaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) for 5 min. Blocking was performed in 2.5% BSA and 10% goat serum (Sigma) in PBS for 30 min. Cells were then incubated with 100×-diluted LAMP-1 antibody followed by 750×-diluted Alexa 647-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen). The DNA dye, Hoechst 33258 (1 μg/ml, Invitrogen), was used to visualize nuclei. Images were captured with a Leica SP5 confocal microscope and a 63× objective lens (Leica Microsystems, Mannheim, Germany). CD69 surface staining and intracellular IL-2 staining were done according to the standard protocols. To measure apoptosis in cells expressing PRR7, we performed annexin V/Dy-647 (Apronex Biotechnologies, Vestec, Czech Republic) staining in combination with the DNA dye, Hoechst 33258, according to the manufacturer's instructions. To measure calcium response to anti-TCR activation, cells were first loaded with 5 μm Fura Red (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen) in loading buffer (1 × Hanks' balanced salt solution, 2% FCS, without Ca2+ or Mg2+) for 30 min at 37 °C. After washing, cells were resuspended in loading buffer supplemented with Ca2+ and Mg2+ and kept on ice. Cells were warmed up for 10 min at 37 °C and then stimulated with an irrelevant control antibody or the anti-TCR C305 mAb (10 μg/ml). Calcium flux was monitored for 240 s. Flow cytometry was carried out on an LSRII instrument (BD Biosciences), and cells were sorted on FACSVantage (BD Biosciences). Analysis of the data was performed using FlowJo software (Tree Star, Ashland, OR) as specified in the figure legends (FIGURE 6, FIGURE 7, FIGURE 8).FIGURE 7Tyrosine phosphorylation of PRR7 and association of PRR7 with Src.

Doi T. Taniguchi H. Fujiyoshi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 327: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) is a 274-aa protein with a sequence typical for TRAPs. It has a short N-terminal extracellular peptide, a single transmembrane segment, and a cytoplasmic part containing several conserved binding motifs (Fig. 1A). These motifs include multiple SH2 domain binding and/or endocytic tyrosine-based motifs (YXX(I/L/V/A)), multiple proline-rich SH3 binding motifs (PXXP), group I WW domain binding motifs (PPXY), and a C-terminal class I PDZ domain binding motif (TTAV). In addition, PRR7 contains a potential submembrane palmitoylation motif (CCXC, Fig. 1A). PRR7 is a highly conserved protein. The percentage of aa identity is more than 94% among available sequences from placental mammals, and a substantial level of aa identity is observed even if lower vertebrate species (amphibian, fish) are included (Table 1). The highest degree of conservation of PRR7 protein sequence was observed in the extracellular, transmembrane, and submembrane parts, including the palmitoylation motif. In addition, the region containing three tyrosine residues, Tyr-153, Tyr-166, and Tyr-177, and the C terminus with the PDZ domain binding motif also displayed a very high degree of homology (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, N-terminal part of PRR7 as well as sequences surrounding tyrosines 153 and 166 form a putative domain identified in Pfam data base (26Finn R.D. Mistry J. Tate J. Coggill P. Heger A. Pollington J.E. Gavin O.L. Gunasekaran P. Ceric G. Forslund K. Holm L. Sonnhammer E.L. Eddy S.R. Bateman A.

Among other proteins, this domain is present in WW domain-binding protein 1 (WBP-1) where it mediates the interaction with WW domains of Yes-associated protein (YAP) via tandem PPXY motifs in its C terminus (27Chen H.I. Sudol M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 7819-7823Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Similar motifs encompass tyrosines 153 and 166 in PRR7, suggesting possible involvement of this region in an interaction with a WW domain containing protein (Fig. 1C).TABLE 1Conservation of PRR7 protein in vertebratesSpeciesLengthIdentityaa%Pongo pygmaeus (orangutan)27399Pan troglodytes (chimpanzee)25998Macaca mulatta (macaque)27698Rattus norvegicus (rat)26998M. musculus (mouse)26997Spermophilus tridecemlineatus (squirrel)26997Canis familiaris (dog)27297Bos taurus (cattle)26997Echinops telfairi (tenrec)27095Sus scrofa (pig)26994Monodelphis domestica (opossum)28081X. tropicalis (frog)22756D. rerio (fish)24648Gasterosteus aculeatus (fish)27944 Open table in a new tab To determine the PRR7 expression pattern in human tissues, we performed RT-qPCR on a panel of multiple tissue RNAs. As shown in Fig. 2A, PRR7 mRNA is expressed most strongly in brain tissue and moderately in several other tissues: esophagus, trachea, lung, ovary, cervix, prostate, testes, thyroid, including the immune organs thymus and lymph nodes. We also found low levels of PRR7 mRNA in a number of human cell lines (Jurkat, U937, THP-1, MEG-01, CaCo2, HEK293FT); the only cell line exhibiting relatively high expression was T cell line MOLT-4 (Fig. 2B). We next analyzed whether the expression level of PRR7 mRNA in PBL changes after activation. Interestingly, we observed rapid up-regulation of PRR7 mRNA in PHA-stimulated PBL. It was detectable at 1 h and peaked at 8 h after stimulation (Fig. 2C). To examine the expression of PRR7 at the protein level, we generated anti-human PRR7 monoclonal antibodies. Unfortunately, none of the generated antibodies could clearly detect PRR7 after immunoblotting of whole primary cell lysates (except for mouse or rat brain tissues; not shown). Moreover, native PRR7 could not be quantitatively immunoprecipitated from cell lysates using these antibodies, suggesting partial blocking of the epitope (not shown). Nevertheless, it was still possible to use immunoprecipitation to concentrate PRR7 protein to the degree sufficient for detection by immunoblotting also in leukocytes. We then used this approach to verify our results from previous experiments. As shown in Fig. 2D, PRR7 protein was detected in PBL activated by various stimuli, including activation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies, PHA, or PMA and ionomycin. We could also detect PRR7 protein in several lymphoid cell lines, including Jurkat, Ramos, and MOLT-4 (Fig. 2E). The highest protein levels were observed in MOLT-4, which correlated well with the higher PRR7 mRNA level in this cell line (Fig. 2, B and E). Because the level of PRR7 expression in leukocytes (cell lines and primary PBL) was low and its direct immunoprecipitation was inefficient, we generated multiple Jurkat cell lines transfected with PRR7 constructs containing a C-terminal GFP tag. Surprisingly, we were not able to establish a Jurkat cell line with a sufficiently high expression of PRR7. Direct observation of the PRR7-GFP-transfected Jurkat cells excluded a rapid necrotic cell death of the transfectants. Instead, we consistently observed a gradual loss of the PRR7 transfectants from the culture within a few days (not shown). PRR7high cells were stained with the DNA dye, propidium iodide, and analysis of the staining suggested that overexpression of PRR7 protein caused apoptosis (not shown). To exclude the possibility that the apoptosis induction is at least in part the result of the stress caused by the transfection procedure (electroporation), we generated a stable Jurkat clone (J-iPRR7) inducibly expressing full-length HA-tagged PRR7. In this case a modified RheoSwitch Mammalian Inducible Expression System (21Lessard J. Aicha S.B. Fournier A. Calvo E. Lavergne E. Pelletier M. Labrie C. Prostate. 2007; 67: 808-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) was utilized. It allowed us to tightly regulate the expression of PRR7 using the synthetic compound RSL1. Without RSL1, PRR7 expression was not detectable; maximal expression was achieved in the presence of RSL1 12 h after induction (Fig. 3A). Strikingly, we observed that in J-iPRR7 cells, apoptosis could be clearly detected within 24 h of induction by RSL1 and gradually increased with time (Fig. 3, B and C), suggesting that apoptosis induction was a direct consequence of PRR7 expression. This process could be to a substantial degree inhibited by caspase inhibitor Z-VAD, demonstrating the involvement of caspase-dependent apoptotic pathways (Fig. 3D). To identify the regions of the PRR7 molecule involved in the apoptosis induction, we generated a set of Jurkat cell lines transiently expressing either full-length PRR7-GFP or its mutants gradually truncated from the C terminus (Fig. 3E). We also generated a mutant where all the tyrosines in the PRR7 sequence were mutated to phenylalanines (all Y to F) and a mutant lacking the N terminus, including extracellular peptide, transmembrane segment, a"
https://openalex.org/W2017295384,"It has recently emerged that glutathione transferase enzymes (GSTs) and other structurally related molecules can be translocated from the external medium into many different cell types. In this study we aim to explore in detail, the structural features that govern cell translocation and by dissecting the human GST enzyme GSTM2-2 we quantatively demonstrate that the α-helical C-terminal domain (GST-C) is responsible for this property. Attempts to further examine the constituent helices within GST-C resulted in a reduction in cell translocation efficiency, indicating that the intrinsic GST-C domain structure is necessary for maximal cell translocation capacity. In particular, it was noted that the α-6 helix of GST-C plays a stabilising role in the fold of this domain. By destabilising the conformation of GST-C, an increase in cell translocation efficiency of up to ∼2-fold was observed. The structural stability profiles of these protein constructs have been investigated by circular dichroism and differential scanning fluorimetry measurements and found to impact upon their cell translocation efficiency. These experiments suggest that the globular, helical domain in the ‘GST-fold’ structural motif plays a role in influencing cellular uptake, and that changes that affect the conformational stability of GST-C can significantly influence cell translocation efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2018871498,"The demonstration of the brain's ability to initiate repair in response to disease or injury has sparked considerable interest in therapeutic strategies to stimulate adult neurogenesis. In this study we examined the effect of a progressive neurodegenerative condition on neural precursor activity in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and hippocampus of the R6/1 transgenic mouse model of Huntington's disease (HD). Our results revealed an age-related decline in SVZ precursor numbers in both wild-type (WT) and HD mice. Interestingly, hippocampal precursor numbers declined with age in WT mice, although we observed maintenance in hippocampal precursor number in the HD animals in response to advancement of the disease. This maintenance was consistent with activation of a recently identified latent hippocampal precursor population. We found that the small latent stem cell population was also maintained in the HD hippocampus at 33 weeks, whereas it was not present in the WT. Our findings demonstrate that, despite a loss of neurogenesis in the HD hippocampus in vivo, there is a unique maintenance of the precursor and stem cells, which may potentially be activated to ameliorate disease symptoms."

FXYD2 is the most abundant renal FXYD but is not expressed in most renal cell lines unless induced by hypertonicity. Expression by transfection of FXYD2a or FXYD2b splice variants in NRK-52E cells reduces the apparent Na+ affinity of the Na,K-ATPase and slows the cell proliferation rate. Based on RT-PCR, mRNAs for both splice variants were expressed in wild type NRK-52E cells as low abundance species. DNA sequencing of the PCR products revealed a base alteration from C to T in FXYD2b but not FXYD2a from both untreated and hypertonicity-treated NRK-52E cells. The 172C→T sequence change exposed a cryptic KKXX endoplasmic reticulum retrieval signal via a premature stop codon. The truncation affected trafficking of FXYD2b and its association with Na,K-ATPase and blocked its effect on enzyme kinetics and cell growth. The data may be explained by altered splicing or selective RNA editing of FXYD2b, a supplementary process that would ensure that it was inactive even if transcribed and translated, in these cells that normally express only FXYD2a. 172C→T mutation was also identified after mutagenesis of FXYD2b by error-prone PCR coupled with a selection for cell proliferation.

Na,K-ATPase is an enzyme in eukaryotic cells that provides non-equilibrium distribution of Na+ and K+ ions across the plasma membrane. Besides its obligatory α and β subunits, the complex contains a so-called “FXYD” subunit (1Sweadner K.J. Rael E. Genomics. 2000; 68: 41-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), a short single span membrane protein involved in regulation of the kinetic properties of Na,K-ATPase. In mammals, there are seven different FXYD genes that are expressed in a tissue- and cell-specific manner. Remarkably, association of the Na,K-ATPase with each of them leads to specific changes in kinetic parameters of the pump either at the level of K0.5 for the substrates or Vmax (for a review, see Ref. 2Geering K. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2006; 290: F241-F250Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). FXYD2, also called the γ subunit, was the first accessory FXYD protein discovered in connection with the Na,K-ATPase (3Collins J.H. Leszyk J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8665-8668Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). It was identified as a proteolipid in membranes from dog kidney that was labeled with a photoaffinity derivative of the specific inhibitor of the pump, ouabain, along with the α and β subunits (4Forbush 3rd, B. Kaplan J.H. Hoffman J.F. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 3667-3676Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Expression of the FXYD2 protein is mostly in kidney (5Mercer R.W. Biemesderfer D. Bliss Jr., D.P. Collins J.H. Forbush 3rd, B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), although the expressed sequence tag database suggests some other tissues as potential sources for FXYD2 (for instance, pancreas and mammary glands). There are two splice variants of FXYD2, FXYD2a and FXYD2b, which are identical in structure except for the N-terminal segment comprising the first exon (6Arystarkhova E. Wetzel R.K. Sweadner K.J. Am.

Based on results from different heterologous expression systems (Xenopus oocytes or mammalian cell transfectants), FXYD2 reduces the activity of the pump by increasing the K0.5 for Na+ as well as for K+ (8Arystarkhova E.

We also demonstrated that both splice variants can be post-translationally modified when expressed in epithelial NRK-52E cells, and those modifications relieved the kinetic effects of splice variants on the activity of Na,K-ATPase (8Arystarkhova E.

Crystal structures of Na,K-ATPase from pig kidney and shark rectal glands unambiguously revealed the FXYD subunit as a genuine part of the complex (14Morth J.P. Pedersen B.P. Toustrup-Jensen M.S.

On the other hand, the flanking regions of FXYD2 were implicated in modulation of Km for ATP (18Pu H.X. Scanzano R. Blostein R. J. Biol.

Expression of FXYD2 splice variants in kidney is complex. For instance, FXYD2a is expressed in proximal convoluted tubules, whereas FXYD2b is found in distal convoluted tubules (6Arystarkhova E.

Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2002; 282: F393-F407Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), whereas in inner medulla, FXYD2a is expressed in intercalated cells of the initial portion of collecting duct and in principal cells in the middle and terminal portions of collecting duct (20Pihakaski-Maunsbach K.

Both splice variants are simultaneously expressed in the same cells in medullary thick ascending limb. The functional significance of the localization of the spliced forms is not yet clear. We showed previously that expression of FXYD2 in NRK-52E cells, either by transfection (FXYD2a or FXYD2b) or by induction with hypertonicity (FXYD2a), correlated with a reduction of Na,K-ATPase activity and the rate of cell growth (8Arystarkhova E.

Although expression of the FXYD2b protein can be achieved in NRK-52E cells (proximal convoluted tubule origin) only by transfection (9Arystarkhova E. Donnet C. Asinovski N.K. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10162-10172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), here we discovered that mRNA for both FXYD2a and FXYD2b is expressed in low abundance in control NRK-52E cells. Surprisingly, we obtained evidence of selective sequence modification of splice variants: there was a base point substitution, 172C→T, in the RT-PCR product for FXYD2b but not for FXYD2a and as a result generation of a premature stop codon in the FXYD2b protein. The “hot spot” in FXYD2b was further confirmed by random mutagenesis. The truncation exposed a targeting sequence with consequences for FXYD2b distribution and interaction with Na,K-ATPase. Thus, the sequence modification was a loss of function and may be utilized by cells as another level of control of Na,K-ATPase. Polyclonal antiserum K3 was used for detection of the α1 and β1 subunits of Na,K-ATPase on blots (22Sweadner K.J. Gilkeson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9016-9022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibody McK1 was used in immunostaining and Western blot to monitor the α1 subunit (23Felsenfeld D.P.

McEnery, Case Western Reserve University) is another monoclonal antibody that recognizes the α1 subunit of Na,K-ATPase (25Choi Y. Dubel S.J. Pacioaiou M.L. Omori A. Ito T. Copeland T.D. Takahashi M.

The RNGB polyclonal antibody raised against the N-terminal peptide of the rat FXYD2b splice variant (6Arystarkhova E. Wetzel R.K. Sweadner K.J. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2002; 282: F393-F407Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) was used to identify the protein on blots as well as in immunostaining of cells. RCT-G1 antiserum was raised against the 13 amino acids at the shared C terminus of FXYD2a and FXYD2b (8Arystarkhova E. Wetzel R.K. Asinovski N.K. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33183-33185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Calnexin was visualized with polyclonal rabbit anti-calnexin antibodies (Stressgen, Enzo Life Sciences). The normal rat kidney epithelial cell line (NRK-52E), rat glioblastoma (C6), and rat skeletal muscle myocytes (L6) were purchased from American Type Culture Collection and grown according to the manufacturer's recommendations in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% FBS (300 mOsm). Hypertonic stress of NRK-52E cells was performed by addition of NaCl (200 mOsm) to the medium for 48 h as described previously (21Wetzel R.K. Pascoa J.L. Arystarkhova E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41750-41757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 26Arystarkhova E. Donnet C. Muñoz-Matta A. Specht S.C. Sweadner K.J. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2007; 292: C1179-C1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Total RNA from cells was prepared with the RNeasy system (Qiagen). The cDNA was obtained using 1 μg of total RNA, oligo(dT) as the priming oligonucleotide, and SuperScript II RT (Invitrogen). Alternatively, cDNA was obtained with the SuperScript III Cell Direct cDNA synthesis system (Invitrogen). The PCR was performed in the presence of 3 mm MgCl2 with either Taq polymerase (Fisher) or Platinum Taq polymerase (Invitrogen). The following primers contained nucleotide sequences from the 5′- and 3′-ends of the coding sequence for rat FXYD2b plus EcoRI and BamHI sites for unidirectional cloning, respectively: forward primer, 5′-GCGAATTCCACCATGGACAGGTGGTAC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CGCGGATCCTCACAGCTCATCTTCATTGAC-3′. Four independent PCRs were performed. PCR products were separated by electrophoresis in 1.2% agarose gels and purified with a QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen). The PCR products were sequenced at the Massachusetts General Hospital DNA core facility using a fluorescently labeled dideoxynucleotide chain termination method. Sequence information on the entire coding region was obtained. Construction of cΔ7 was performed by PCR using the plasmid containing full-length cDNA for rat FXYD2b as a template. The following primers contained nucleotide sequences from FXYD2b (including the new stop codon in the reverse primer) plus EcoRI and BamHI sites for unidirectional cloning: forward, 5′-GCGAATTCCACCATGGACAGGTGGTAC-3′; reverse, 5′-CGCGGATCCCTACCTATGCTTCTTACTGCCCCC-3′. As designed, the nucleotides for the final 7 amino acids are not present in the expression vector. The PCR was performed with the Fisher Taq polymerase in a RapidCycler instrument (Idaho Technologies). The gel-purified DNA fragment was cloned into a pIRES-neo vector (Clontech), and the mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The plasmid was further transfected into NRK-52E cells, and stable transfectants were selected under pressure of G418 2The abbreviations used are: G418GeneticinTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycineBis-Tris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diolERendoplasmic reticulumBLASTBasic Local Alignment Search Tool. antibiotic.

Crude membrane preparations were obtained from scraped cells by homogenization and differential centrifugation (6Arystarkhova E. Wetzel R.K. Sweadner K.J. Am. J. Physiol.

Partial purification of Na,K-ATPase from cell membranes (1.4 mg/ml) was with SDS extraction (0.56 mg/ml) and sedimentation on 7–30% sucrose gradients. Fractions were collected from the bottom and analyzed on SDS-Tricine gels. Typical specific activity of Na,K-ATPase was 50–150 μmol of Pi/mg of protein/h in preparations from NRK-52E cells (6Arystarkhova E. Wetzel R.K. Sweadner K.J. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2002; 282: F393-F407Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Isolation of membranes from rat kidney outer medulla was performed as described elsewhere (27Jorgensen P.L. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 32: 277-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). To obtain NRK cell lysates, a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, and protein phosphatase inhibitor mixture I (Sigma) (1:100, v/v) was used. Cells were scraped and triturated, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 10 min (Sorvall SS-34). NRK-52E cells mock-transfected or transfected with full-length FXYD2b or truncated form of FXYD2b were grown to confluence in 75-cm2 flasks in DMEM culture medium supplemented with l-glutamine, penicillin, and 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were scraped and homogenized in TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 1 mm EDTA) containing 250 mm sucrose. Nuclei and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was centrifuged at 19,000 × g, and the pellet was resuspended in TE buffer containing 1.3 m sucrose. It was layered on a cushion consisting of 2 m sucrose and 1.6 m sucrose (both in TE buffer) and covered by another two layers of 1.1 m sucrose and 0.8 m sucrose (in TE buffer). Centrifugation was at 100,000 × g for 2 h (Beckman SW50.1) (adapted from Refs. 18Pu H.X. Scanzano R. Blostein R. J. Biol.

Fractions enriched in endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, and plasma membranes were collected at the interfaces 1.3/1.6, 1.1/1.3, and 0.8/1.1 m sucrose, respectively; diluted with TE buffer; centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min (Beckman Ti 70); and resuspended in TE buffer containing 250 mm sucrose. Membrane fractions were resolved either on SDS-Tricine or on 4–12% Bis-Tris-SDS gels with MES buffer (NuPAGE system, Invitrogen) (8Arystarkhova E. Wetzel R.K. Asinovski N.K. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol.

Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and incubated with antibodies, and detection was with chemiluminescence with an LAS 4000 imager. For positive control samples, membrane preparations from kidney were used. Quantification was with ImageQuant TL image analysis software (GE Healthcare). Na,K-ATPase activity was measured in crude membranes from either control or transfected cells as a function of Na+ concentration in medium containing 3 mm Tris-ATP, 4 mm MgCl2, and 30 mm histidine, pH 7.4 in the presence of 20 mm K+ (9Arystarkhova E. Donnet C. Asinovski N.K. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10162-10172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). All the reactions were performed at 37 °C for 30 min with and without 3 mm ouabain, and ouabain-sensitive Pi release was measured colorimetrically by using the Fiske-Subbarow method. Data were analyzed by nonlinear regression using the Sigma Plot Graph System (Jandel Scientific). Na+ activation curves were fitted according to the Hill model for ligand binding. Alternatively, activity in crude membranes was measured using the so-called “yellow method,” which tolerates more protein and lipid. After quenching, the unreduced phosphomolybdate complex was extracted into an isobutanol organic phase where its absorbance was measured at 380 nm. NRK-52E cells, either wild type or transfected as described above, were seeded into 96-well flat bottomed plates (5 × 103 cells/well) in quadruplicate and allowed to adhere overnight. Cell proliferation over the following 2–6 days was assayed based on the cleavage of the tetrazolium salt WST-1 (Roche Diagnostics) by mitochondrial dehydrogenases in viable cells. Quantification was with a microtiter plate reader at 450 nm (21Wetzel R.K. Pascoa J.L. Arystarkhova E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41750-41757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 26Arystarkhova E. Donnet C. Muñoz-Matta A. Specht S.C. Sweadner K.J. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2007; 292: C1179-C1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemistry was performed as described elsewhere in more detail (6Arystarkhova E. Wetzel R.K. Sweadner K.J. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2002; 282: F393-F407Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were fixed with 2% periodate, lysine, paraformaldehyde solution for 30 min at room temperature and washed with PBS followed by 5-min incubation with 1% SDS in PBS, several washes with PBS, and blocking with 5% goat serum in PBS to prevent nonspecific binding of secondary antibodies. McK1 antibody was used for α1 detection, whereas RNGB antibodies were used to probe expression of FXYD2b. Calnexin antibody was used as a positive control for detection of endoplasmic reticulum. The secondary antibodies were either Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:300; Accurate Chemical) or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:300; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Slides were examined with a Nikon TE300 fluorescence microscope equipped with a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 scanning laser confocal system (version 3.2). Random mutagenesis was performed with the GeneMorph PCR Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using full-length rat FXYD2b (verified by sequencing) as a template. The following primers included nucleotide sequences for rat FXYD2b, partial 5′ and 3′ sequences from the plasmid, and EcoRI and BamHI restriction sites for unidirectional cloning: RMF, 5′-CTGCGGCCGCGTCGACGGAATTCCACCATG-3′; RMRV, 5′-GCACACTGGCGGCCGTTACTAGTGGATCCTCA-3′. The expected rate of introduced mutations by Mutazyme was in the range 0–3/200 bp. PCR was performed in a RapidCycler instrument (Idaho Technologies) in glass capillary tubes. The gel-purified DNA cassette was ligated into a pIRES vector as a pool and transfected into NRK-52E cells for selection and subcloning as described earlier. Selection of stable clones was with G418 (8Arystarkhova E. Wetzel R.K. Asinovski N.K. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33183-33185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 9Arystarkhova E. Donnet C. Asinovski N.K. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10162-10172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In control experiments, the random mutagenesis procedure was performed with either Mutazyme or polymerases from different sources (Fisher, Eppendorf, and Applied Biosystems) in parallel and subcloning with Escherichia coli instead of mammalian cell transfection. DNA sequencing was performed at the Massachusetts General Hospital DNA Core facility with the following primers: forward primer: GamB, 5′-GCGAATTCCACCATGGACAGGTGGTAC-3′; reverse primer: pIRESRev, 5′-GCGCAGAAGTCATGCCCGC-3′. Sequence information on the entire coding region of FXYD2b mutants was obtained. The FXYD2 subunit is abundantly expressed in several nephron segments, but NRK-52E and other renal epithelial cells lack its expression as a protein in basal conditions (8Arystarkhova E. Wetzel R.K. Asinovski N.K. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33183-33185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 26Arystarkhova E. Donnet C. Muñoz-Matta A. Specht S.C.

U.S.A. 2001; 98: 13414-13419Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Hypertonic stress (500 mOsm NaCl in culture medium) results in a selective induction of FXYD2a protein without any trace of the FXYD2b protein (21Wetzel R.K. Pascoa J.L. Arystarkhova E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41750-41757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, mRNA for both FXYD2a and FXYD2b could be detected by PCR in both control and hypertonicity-treated cells (not shown). Moreover, with RT-PCR, FXYD2b mRNA was also detected in other cell lines, such as C6 (rat glioblastoma) and L6 (rat skeletal muscle myocytes), where the protein was not detected (not shown). To verify their identity, the PCR products from NRK-52E cells were submitted to sequence analysis. Remarkably, although being the products of alternative splicing of the same gene, FXYD2a and FXYD2b showed a difference in the nucleotide sequence of the shared exon 5: cytidine in FXYD2a was replaced by thymidine in FXYD2b (Fig. 1A). This change in the DNA sequence resulted in a nonsense mutation and appearance of a premature stop codon and, as a result, should produce a truncated form of FXYD2b (Fig. 1B). The premature stop codon prevents translation of the last 7 amino acids. The same transition mutation was identified in FXYD2b from C6 rat glioma cells (not shown). The fact that FXYD2a and FXYD2b have different 5′-UTR sequences supports a potential role for different post-transcriptional processing either via splicing or RNA editing (discussed below). When hypertonicity was used to induce FXYD2 expression, the base substitution was still absent from FXYD2a mRNA and present in FXYD2b mRNA. Heterogeneity seen at the 172C→T site in FXYD2b from the hypertonicity-treated cells (Fig. 1A, bottom panel) suggests that the base alteration was responsive to metabolic changes. Because no FXYD2b protein was observed on Western blots from control or hypertonicity-treated cells in contrast to induction of FXYD2a (21Wetzel R.K. Pascoa J.L. Arystarkhova E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41750-41757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), the data suggest that truncated protein, if made, was below the level of detection in cells that normally express only FXYD2a and that have a low abundance of FXYD2b mRNA transcripts. In repeated experiments, we detected T or a mixture of C and T in six of six PCR sequence experiments on mRNA isolated from NRK, C6, and L6 cells and in zero of four experiments with rat and mouse renal mRNA. To estimate the efficacy of the base alteration, we performed subcloning of NRK-52E cells and sequenced the PCR products. We detected T instead of C in three of 12 subclones. To characterize the truncated form of FXYD2b, we produced it independently by site-directed mutagenesis of C172. Stable transfectants (cΔ7 for C terminus without 7 amino acids) were generated in NRK-52E cells. Analysis of the clones with FXYD2b-specific antibody (N terminus) demonstrated a high level of expression of the truncated protein. As expected, the electrophoretic mobility of the mutant protein was faster than that of the wild type FXYD2b (Fig. 2A). Noticeably, there was also an extra band with a slightly slower electrophoretic mobility that coincided with that of the wild type FXYD2b (Fig. 2A). This suggests a potential processing or post-translational modification of the truncated form of FXYD2b when expressed in mammalian cells. The RCT-G1 antibody, which was raised against the last 13 amino acids in the C terminus of FXYD2, did not recognize the cΔ7 protein (Fig. 2B). Therefore, parallel application of RNGB and RCT-G1 antibodies can be useful as a method to discriminate between the full-length and truncated forms of FXYD2b regardless of the status of their post-translational modification. To evaluate the effect of truncation on kinetic parameters of the pump, Na,K-ATPase activity was analyzed in crude membranes. No significant changes in the Vmax were seen between mock-transfected cells, NRK-52E cells transfected with the full-length FXYD2b, and cΔ7 cells. However, the apparent affinity for Na+ was s"
