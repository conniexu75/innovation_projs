https://openalex.org/W1537312083,"Parameters associated with activation and desensitization of the nicotinic receptor in the BC3H-1 muscle cell line have been compared with the state transitions that result upon combination with agonist. 125I-labeled cobra alpha-toxin is found to bind to an apparent single class of surface nicotinic receptors on the cells in situ with a rate constant of 1.15 x 10(5) M-1 s-1. The competition between cholinergic ligands and alpha-toxin reveals that agonists, but not classical antagonists, will promote a slow conversion to a receptor state where the affinity for agonists is enhanced. Moreover, agonists such as carbamylcholine elicit a permeability increase to 22Na+ ions that slowly decrements at a rate and to an extent closely paralleled by the conversion of the receptor to the high affinity state. Upon removal of the agonist, both the affinity increase and the diminished permeability change are completely reversible and again exhibit similar kinetics for their return to the original state. A comparison of the capacity of full agonists to compete with alpha-toxin binding and elicit a permeability change suggests that in the absence of agonist, receptor predominates in a low affinity activatable state. Binding of agonists to the low affinity state exhibits little if any cooperativity (n = 0.97 to 1.31), while the corresponding permeability change appears more cooperative (n = 1.31 to 1.52). By contrast, when receptors have been previously equilibrated with agonists, occupation of the receptor occurs over a 3- to 5-fold lower concentration range. Binding following equilibration closely correlates with a concomitant decrease in activatable receptor resulting from equivalent exposure to agonist. Furthermore, under equilibrium conditions, the binding of full agonists is typified by a moderate degree of homotropic cooperativity (1.25 to 1.44), enabling the receptor to desensitize over a narrow range of agonist concentration. Simultaneous measurement of occupation and activation parameters has enabled us to compare a state function for desensitization which is generated from binding parameters with the reduction in permeability seen in the desensitization process. A scheme describing the association of agonist with two functionally distinct receptor states is developed to account for the cooperative relationship between agonist binding and desensitization of the receptor."

https://openalex.org/W1995006379,"The methods of Fechner and Stevens for assessing sensation quantity usually yield different psychophysical functions even when all other factors are controlled. In this experiment, corresponding differences occurred when different features of the same sensory receptor signals were analyzed. In the visual system, the receptor potential saturated if the peak but not the area was measured; these results match visual psychophysical functions obtained with the methods of Fechner and Stevens, respectively. This result suggests that both methods are equally valid but that each method yields the particular psychophysical function appropriate for a particular kind of information processing. A novel factor in determining sensation quantity, namely the time used by the observer to make a judgment, is implicated by the data."

Hydrocarbon gas production is suppressed by hydroxyl radical scavenging agents. Azide, an inhibitor of catalase, augments the production of hydrocarbon gases. These observations constitute chemical evidence for the generation of hydroxyl radicals by microsomes."
https://openalex.org/W1975682914,"Female weanling rats from a colony maintained on a diet low in vitamin D were raised on a diet that was deficient in vitamin D but was otherwise adequate. Vitamin D deficiency was confirmed in the rats by hypocalcemia and the absence of vitamin D metabolites in blood. These females gave birth to litters that were slightly smaller than control litters from females maintained on a vitamin D-containing diet. The pups from the vitamin D-deficient mothers appeared normal throughout lactation, and at weaning had normal concentrations of calcium and phosphate in the plasma. These results indicate that vitamin D and its metabolites are not necessary for reproduction and fetal development in the rat."
https://openalex.org/W167042086,"The export of glutathione from cultured human diploid fibroblasts into the surrounding medium was found by isotopic labeling experiments using [35S]cystine and by enzymatic measurements. The major part of the glutathione exported from the cells was found in normal culture medium as mixed disulfide of glutathione and cysteine. Radioactivity of 35S, mostly derived from cellular glutathione, was mainly located in glutathione moiety, not in cysteine moiety, of the mixed disulfide. Export of free glutathione was found when cystine-free medium was used. It was, therefore, concluded that mixed disulfide of glutathione and cysteine was formed in the medium by exported glutathione and medium cystine via sulfhydryl-disulfide exchange reaction. Amount of total glutathione exported from the cells was measured by enzymatic method and it was found that more than 10% of normal cellular glutathione was exported within 2 h. Apparent concentration of glutathione in the medium after a day of culture reached 3 to 4 micrometer, which was comparable to that observed in normal plasma by the same enzymatic method."

https://openalex.org/W1534432664,"We have studied the binding of alpha-bungarotoxin to a particulate fraction of goldfish brain enriched in synaptosomes. The binding is specific and saturable and exhibits the pharmacological properties of a nicotinic cholinergic receptor. Equilibrium binding measurements yield a single dissociation constant (KD) of 0.92 nM. Kinetic analysis revealed one association rate constant and two dissociation rate constants. Dissociation constants calculated from kinetic measurements were 1.9 nM and 12.5 pM. The toxin . receptor complex is readily solubilized in nonionic detergent. The isoelectric point of the toxin . receptor complex was found to be 5.00 +/- 0.01. Sedimentation velocity analysis in sucrose/H2O and sucrose/D2O gradients in conjunction with Sepharose 4B chromatography and diffusion experiments yielded a sedimentation constant of 11.45, a partial specific volume of 0.79 cm3/g for the toxin . receptor . detergent complex, and a molecular weight of approximately 340,000 for the toxin . receptor complex."

It is shown that [3H]Met-tRNAf and [14C]H3-eIF-2 are present on the filter in equimolar amounts when ATP, creatine phosphate, and creatine kinase are included in the reaction mixture. Under these conditions the factor is 100% active. With small amounts of factor significant losses occur due to adsorption to the wall of the reaction vessels, resulting in seemingly low activities of eIF-2. These losses can be prevented by the presence of stimulatory proteins, which enhance the recovery of both [3H]Met-tRNAf and [14C]H3-eIF-2 on the filter but do not alter their ratio."

Two forms of purified pulmonary cytochrome P-450, which are known to have different monomeric molecular weights, spectral properties, and substrate specificities, were compared. Metabolite profiles were obtained using high pressure liquid chromatography. Metabolites that chromatographed with the 3-hydroxy and quinone standards accounted for 95% of the total activity of cytochrome I. With cytochrome II metabolism at positions 9 and 10 accounted for 40 to 50% of the total activity; products that chromatographed with the 3-hydroxy standard were 30 to 40% of the total. Formation of the 4,5- or 7,8-dihydrodiol metabolites accounted for less than 5% of the total produced by either cytochrome. The metabolism of benzo(a)pyrene by cytochrome II was inhibited by ..cap alpha..-naphthoflavone (K/sub i/ = 8.2 +- 0.4 x 10/sup -9/ M) in a manner that did not affect the profile of the metabolites produced. Metabolism by cytochrome I was not significantly inhibited by ..cap alpha..-naphthoflavone at a concentration of 10/sup -4/ M. Cytochrome II, unlike cytochrome I, catalyzed the metabolism of benzo(a)pyrene to products that bound covalently to DNA.

https://openalex.org/W1539377698,"The primary tissue sites of catabolism of plasma proteins with long circulating half-lives are unknown. It has been difficult to identify these sites because plasma proteins are delivered to tissues at relatively slow rates but are rapidly degraded intracellularly within lysosomes. Therefore, a tracer attached to protein is lost from the site of uptake before an amount sufficient for quantitation can accumulate. We hypothesized that sucrose (Glupal-2 /3Fruf) would be a useful label to circumvent this difficulty because of the stability of sucrose in lysosomes; and thus, sucrose should remain in tissue long after the protein to which it was attached had been degraded to products released from the lysosome. [G-3HJRaffinose (RAF, GalpalGlupcwl2flFruf) was selected as the vehicle for attaching sucrose to protein. [31XjRAF was converted to the C-6 aldehydogalactose form with galactose oxidase and then covalently coupled to protein by reductive amination using NaBH3CN. [‘H]RAF was coupled first to two relatively long lived plasma proteins, bovine serum albumin and fetuin. The half-lives of these proteins in the rat circulation (&,* = -24 h) was unchanged, suggesting that RAF did not alter the normal mechanisms of protein clearance. When attached to short lived proteins with known sites of catabolism, such as asialofetuin, RNase B, and heatdenatured albumin, neither the tissue nor cellular sites of uptake of the proteins were altered. Thus, 13H]RAFasialofetuin was recovered almost exclusively (>90%) in the liver parenchymal cell fraction, while both [JHJRAF-labeled RNase B and heat-denatured albumin were recovered primarily (>85%) in nonparenchymal cells. In addition, the RAF label was observed to reside stably (tl,2 > 100 h) in the liver following degradation of the carrier protein; in contrast, radioactivity from “‘Ilabeled asialofetuin or RNase B was rapidly (tl,z < 30 min) lost from liver. Radioactivity from 13H]RAF-proteins was recovered in a lysosomally enriched subcellular fraction in liver and consisted of a low molecular weight species (-llOO), containing both glucose and fructose in a ratio similar to that in the original protein. The results of these studies establish that 13H]RAF"

https://openalex.org/W1509633907,"Abstract Several analogs of lysolecithin were found to solubilize human erythrocyte ghosts comparably or even better than other detergents. Derivatives with aliphatic chains of 12 to 14 carbons were most effective. The phosphorylcholine detergents apparently possess low protein-denaturing properties, since they, for the first time, allowed the solubilization of enzymatically active acyl-CoA:lysolecithin acyltransferase from thymocyte plasma membranes. The solubilized enzyme was not sedimented at 177,000 x g for 60 min and penetrated into Sepharose 6B gels. Low detergent concentration resulted in a selective extraction of the acyltransferase (about 70%) as compared to alkaline phosphatase, nucleotide pyrophosphatase, gamma-glutamyltransferase or Mg2+-ATPase (30 to 40%). The selectivity was reflected in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis patterns of soluble and sedimentable membrane fractions; three bands of approximately 53, 84, and 94 x 10(3) daltons were enriched in the supernatants, whereas one band of about 68 x 10(3) daltons was concentrated in the pellet. The preferential extraction of acyltransferase may be related to particularly high affinity of lysolecithin analogs for this enzyme, which at higher concentrations was competitively inhibited by these detergents. The inhibitor constants ranged from 1400 micron for the C10 analog (ET-10-H) to 80 micron for the compound with 16 carbons (ET-16-H) per aliphatic chain."

https://openalex.org/W33079109,"DL-2-Rromooctanoate inhibits fatty acid oxidation in perfused rat liver and in mitochondria isolated from rat liver. Perfusion of livers for 12 min with 0.6 mu bromooctanoate causes complete and irreversible inhibition of ketogenesis from octanoate or oleate. Bromooctanoate also inhibits gluconeogenesis from lactate plus pyruvate but not from dihydroxyacetone. In isolated mitochondria, bromooctanoate irreversibly inhibits the oxidation of medium and long chain fatty acids and their L-carnitine esters. The extent of inhibition depends on the concentration of inhibitor and on the concentration of mitochondria. For example, 50% inhibition of palmitoyl L-carnitine oxidation is attained with about 2.5 nmol of bromooctanoate/mg of protein and 100% inhibition is attained with about 6 nmol of bromooctanoate/mg of protein. An energy-dependent activation of bromooctanoate occurs prior to the onset of inhibition. The conversion of bromooctanoate to its inhibitory form is not dependent on carnitine. Direct measurement of the content of coenzyme A and its derivatives in inhibited mitochondria indicates that the inhibitory effects of bromooctanoate are not caused by depletion of mitochondrial free CoA in the form of bromooctanoyl-CoA. Treatment of mitochondria with bromooctanoate does not prevent the subsequent formation of acyl-CoA from added fatty acid substrates. These and other results support the conclusion that an activated derivative of 2-bromooctanoic acid inhibits one or more of the enzymes of p-oxidation."
https://openalex.org/W1589930724,"Extracts of Acanthamoeba castellanii contain four myosin-like ATPases (Maruta, H., Gadasi, H., Collins, J.H., and Korn, E.D. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 3624-3630): double-headed Acanthamoeba myosin II and single-headed Acanthamoeba myosins IA, IB, and IC, which have heavy chains of 170,000, 130,000, 125,000, and 130,000 daltons, respectively, as well as different light chains. In the accompanying paper, evidence is presented that suggests that Acanthamoeba myosin IC is the same molecule as Acanthamoeba myosin IA plus a regulatory 20,000-dalton peptide. This conclusion is confirmed by the identity of the peptide maps obtained by limited proteolysis of the heavy chains of Acanthamoeba myosins IA and IC by Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease. However, peptide maps of the heavy chains of Acanthamoeba myosins IA, IB, and II obtained by limited proteolysis by the Staphylococcus protease and chymotrypsin and by chemical cleavage by cyanogen bromide and cyanylation have few, if any, peptides in common. From this evidence, and the enzymatic and subunit data in the accompanying paper, it is concluded that the three Acanthamoeba myosin isoenzymes, IA (IC), IB, and II, are products of different genes."

https://openalex.org/W1532386728,"This study examined the possibility that generation of heme within mitochondria may provide a local concentration sufficient to inhibit the activity of delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) synthase, the enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step in hepatic heme biosynthesis. This was accomplished by simultaneously running ALA synthase and heme synthase activities in intact mitochondria isolated from rat liver. Radiochemical assays were used to measure the enzyme activities. ALA synthase activity did not decrease as the rate of heme formation was increased by varying the concentration of substrates for heme synthase. Even at a rate of heme generation estimated to be at least 75 times the rate occuring in vivo, ALA synthase activity was unchanged. We conclude that end product inhibition of ALA synthase activity by heme is not an important physiological mechanism for regulation of hepatic heme biosynthesis."

https://openalex.org/W172854789,"A nuclear subfraction containing bound estrogen receptor in presumed complex with its nuclear acceptor site has been partially purified from hen oviduct. Sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation was used to separate mechanically sheared chromatin (i.e. lysed nuclei) into several fractions which differed in protein to DNA ratio as well as in vitro template activity. Gradient fractions were then examined for the presence of bound estrogen receptors. Care was taken to use physiological ionic strength buffers when preparing nuclei since the number of estrogen receptors per nucleus decreased from 5600 to 1600 when nuclei prepared in low ionic strength (mu = 0.013 M) were compared with nuclei prepared in physiological ionic strength (mu = 0.2 M). [3H]Estradiol was introduced into nuclear estrogen receptors by exposing minced oviduct to labeled hormone in tissue culture or by exchanging nuclear estrogen receptor complexes formed in vivo with labeled hormone. In all cases, receptor was found in a fast sedimenting nuclear subfraction of low in vitro template activity. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis revealed no differences between proteins from receptor-containing and slower sedimenting fractions. Hybrdization experiments using a cDNA probe made from ovalbumin mRNA indicated no enrichment of this gene in DNA from receptor-containing nuclear material. Salt-extracted nuclear estrogen receptor was shown to partially aggregate to fast sedimenting species of heterogeneous size when sedimented in gradients containing low salt concentrations. Bound receptors were distinguished from such receptor aggregates using a novel electrophoresis technique. In addition, receptor aggregates could be disrupted in high salt, while bound receptors were resistant to this treatment. The number of exchangeable nuclear estrogen receptors in immature chicks given secondary estrogen stimulation was compared with birds that had been withdrawn from hormone. The number of receptors per nucleus was shown to be higher in animals given secondary stimulation, and these receptors were associated exclusively with fast sedimenting nuclear material."

The protein inhibits the hydrolysis of single-stranded DNA by KB DNase, DNase I, DNase II, and nuclease S1, but has no effect on the hydrolysis of double-stranded DNA by these enzymes.
