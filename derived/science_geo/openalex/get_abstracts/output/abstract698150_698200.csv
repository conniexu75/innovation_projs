https://openalex.org/W4289782646,"In December 2020, UNAIDS released a new set of ambitious targets calling for 95% of all people living with HIV to know their HIV status, 95% of all people with diagnosed HIV infection to receive sustained antiretroviral therapy, and 95% of all people receiving antiretroviral therapy to have viral suppression by 2025. Adopted by United Nations Member states in June 2021 as part of the new Political Declaration on HIV and AIDS, these targets, combined with ambitious primary prevention targets and focused attention to supporting enablers, aim to bridge inequalities in treatment coverage and outcomes and accelerate HIV incidence reductions by focusing on progress in all sub-populations, age groups and geographic settings. Here we summarise the evidence and decisions underpinning the new global targets."

To date, various computer-aided solutions have been proposed to identify and classify skin cancer. In this paper, a deep learning model with a shallow architecture is proposed to classify the lesions into benign and malignant. To achieve effective training while limiting overfitting problems due to limited training data, image preprocessing and data augmentation processes are introduced. After this, the 'box blur' down-scaling method is employed, which adds efficiency to our study by reducing the overall training time and space complexity significantly. Our proposed shallow convolutional neural network (SCNN_12) model is trained and evaluated on the Kaggle skin cancer data ISIC archive which was augmented to 16485 images by implementing different augmentation techniques. The model was able to achieve an accuracy of 98.87% with optimizer Adam and a learning rate of 0.001. In this regard, parameter and hyper-parameters of the model are determined by performing ablation studies. To assert no occurrence of overfitting, experiments are carried out exploring k-fold cross-validation and different dataset split ratios. Furthermore, to affirm the robustness the model is evaluated on noisy data to examine the performance when the image quality gets corrupted.This research corroborates that effective training for medical image analysis, addressing training time and space complexity, is possible even with a lightweighted network using a limited amount of training data."
https://openalex.org/W4289782657,"Carbon emissions from civil buildings refer to the carbon emissions generated during the operation of civil buildings. With the continuous development of the urban economy and the improvement of people’s living standards, this part of carbon emission puts tremendous pressure on China to achieve the goal of carbon peaking and carbon neutral. In the context of rapid urbanization, studying the spatiotemporal characteristics and influencing factors of the carbon emissions from civil buildings have strong practical significance for China to achieve the ""dual carbon"" goal. Based on the emission data from 104 prefecture-level cities in China, we examine the spatiotemporal characteristics of the civil building carbon emissions from the perspectives of temporal evolution trend, spatial distribution and its dynamic evolution, spatial difference and its decomposition, and spatial autocorrelation characteristics. Finally, we reveal the influencing factors of the carbon emissions from civil buildings using static panel data models and spatial dynamic panel data models. The results of the study show that: (1) During the sample period, the carbon emissions from civil buildings have increased year by year. The civil building carbon emissions have become an important source of China’s overall carbon emissions. Realizing energy saving and emission reduction in the operational stage of civil buildings is crucial to realizing China’s ""dual carbon"" goal. (2) According to the estimated results, there is a significant inverted U-shaped non-linear relationship between urbanization and civil building carbon emissions. Most Chinese cities are located in the upward part of the inverted U-shaped curve at present. Thus, the traditional economic growth model characterized by high energy consumption and high emission during rapid urbanization should be abandoned to reduce the carbon emissions from civil buildings. (3) Technological progress and fixed asset investment can effectively reduce the carbon emissions from civil buildings. At the same time, the level of marketization and social consumption expenditure positively affect the carbon emissions from civil buildings. It is necessary to improve the relevant market mechanisms, policy subsidies, and other means to encourage the application of green energy-saving technologies in civil buildings. Also, it is needed to guide the urban residents’ consumption structure and lifestyle in a low-carbon direction, to reduce the energy consumption and carbon emissions during the operation of civil buildings."
https://openalex.org/W4289847657,"The COVID-19 pandemic is found to be one of the external stimuli that greatly affects mobility of people, leading to a shift of transportation modes towards private individual ones. To properly explain the change in people’s transport behavior, especially in pre- and post- pandemic periods, a tensor-based framework is herein proposed and applied to Pun Pun–the only public bicycle-sharing system in Bangkok, Thailand–where multidimensional trip data of Pun Pun are decomposed into four different modes related to their spatial and temporal dimensions by a non-negative Tucker decomposition approach. According to our computational results, the first pandemic wave has a sizable influence not only on Pun Pun but also on other modes of transportation. Nonetheless, Pun Pun is relatively more resilient, as it recovers more quickly than other public transportation modes. In terms of trip patterns, we find that, prior to the pandemic, trips made during weekdays are dominated by business trips with two peak periods (morning and evening peaks), while those made during weekends are more related to leisure activities as they involve stations nearby a public park. However, after the first pandemic wave ends, the patterns of weekday trips have been drastically changed, as the number of business trips sharply drops, while that of educational trips connecting metro/subway stations with a major educational institute in the region significantly rises. These findings may be regarded as a reflection of the ever-changing transport behavior of people seeking a sustainable mode of private transport, with a more positive outlook on the use of bicycle-sharing system in Bangkok, Thailand."
https://openalex.org/W4289848143,"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is characterized by the presence of high circulating levels of non-infectious lipoprotein-like HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) particles thought to contribute to chronic immune dysfunction in patients. Lipid and metabolomic analysis of humanized livers from immunodeficient chimeric mice (uPA/SCID) revealed that HBV infection dysregulates several lipid metabolic pathways. Small molecule inhibitors of lipid biosynthetic pathway enzymes acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), fatty acid synthase, and subtilisin kexin isozyme-1/site-1 protease in HBV-infected HepG2-NTCP cells demonstrated potent and selective reduction of extracellular HBsAg. However, a liver-targeted ACC inhibitor did not show antiviral activity in HBV-infected liver chimeric mice, despite evidence of on-target engagement. Our study suggests that while HBsAg production may be dependent on hepatic de novo lipogenesis in vitro , this may be overcome by extrahepatic sources (such as lipolysis or diet) in vivo . Thus, a combination of agents targeting more than one lipid metabolic pathway may be necessary to reduce HBsAg levels in patients with chronic HBV infection."
https://openalex.org/W4289782697,"When the threat of COVID-19 became widely acknowledged, many hoped that this epidemic would squash ""the anti-vaccine movement"". However, when vaccines started arriving in rich countries at the end of 2020, it appeared that vaccine hesitancy might be an issue even in the context of this major epidemic. Does it mean that the mobilization of vaccine-critical activists on social media is one of the main causes of this reticence to vaccinate against COVID-19? In this paper, we wish to contribute to current work on vaccine hesitancy during the COVID-19 epidemic by looking at one of the many mechanisms which can cause reticence towards vaccines: the capacity of vaccine-critical activists to influence a wider public on social media. We analyze the evolution of debates over the COVID-19 vaccine on the French Twittosphere, during two first years of the pandemic, with a particular attention to the spreading capacity of vaccine-critical websites. We address two main questions: 1) Did vaccine-critical contents gain ground during this period? 2) Who were the central actors in the diffusion of these contents? While debates over vaccines experienced a tremendous surge during this period, the share of vaccine-critical contents in these debates remains stable except for a limited number of short periods associated with specific events. Secondly, analyzing the community structure of the re-tweets hyper-graph, we reconstruct the mesoscale structure of the information flows, identifying and characterizing the major communities of users. We analyze their role in the information ecosystem: the largest right-wing community has a typical echo-chamber behavior collecting all the vaccine-critical tweets from outside and recirculating it inside the community. The smaller left-wing community is less permeable to vaccine-critical contents but, has a large capacity to spread it once adopted."
https://openalex.org/W4289853169,"Background Following the active ageing model based on the Health, Lifelong Learning, Participation and Security pillars, this research has a twofold objective: i) to classify older adults according to active ageing profiles, taking into account the four pillars, and ii) to ascertain the relationship between the profiles and personal and contextual factors, as well as well-being and quality of life in old age. Methods A study sample of 5,566 Spanish older adults who participated in wave 6 of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) was included. Data were analysed in different steps applying several statistical analyses (Principal Component, Cluster, Discriminant, Multiple Correspondence and bivariate analysis with Pearson chi-square and ANOVA). Results Five older adult profiles were obtained (I: with moderate activity; II: quasi-dependents; III: with active ageing-limiting conditions; IV: with diverse and balanced activity; V: with excellent active ageing conditions). The first three profiles were characterised by subjects with a high average age, low educational level, who were retired or housewives, and who perceived a moderate level of loneliness, satisfaction with the social network and quality of life, as well as having a larger family network, but living in small households or alone. In contrast, the latter two profiles showed better personal and contextual conditions, well-being and quality of life. Discussion and conclusions The multidimensional approach to active ageing followed in this article has revealed the presence of several older adult profiles, which are confined to groups with better or worse active ageing conditions. In this context, if ageing is a process that reflects the previous way of life, intervention priorities will have to consider actions that promote better conditions during the life cycle."
https://openalex.org/W4289782714,"In heart failure (HF), increased physical activity is associated with improved quality of life, reduced hospitalisation, and increased longevity and is an important aim of treatment. However, physical activity levels in individuals living with HF are typically extremely low. This qualitative study with one-to-one interviews systematically explores perceived clinical, environmental, and psychosocial barriers and enablers in older adults (≥70 years old) living with HF. Semi-structured interviews (N = 16) based on the Theoretical Domains Framework elicited 39 belief statements describing the barriers and enablers to physical activity. Theoretical domains containing these beliefs and corresponding constructs that were both pervasive and common were deemed most relevant. These were: concerns about physical activity (Beliefs about Consequences), self-efficacy (Beliefs about Capabilities), social support (Social Influences), major health event (Environmental Context and Resources), goal behavioural (Goal), action planning (Behavioural Regulation). This work extends the limited research on the modifiable barriers and enablers for physical activity participation by individuals living with HF. The research findings provide insights for cardiologists, HF-specialist nurses, and physiotherapists to help co-design and deliver a physical activity intervention more likely to be effective for individuals living with HF."
https://openalex.org/W4289834003,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a typical category of arrhythmia. Clinical diagnosis of AF is based on the detection of abnormal R-R intervals (RRIs) with an electrocardiogram (ECG). Previous studies considered this detection problem as a classification problem and focused on extracting a number of features. In this study we demonstrate that instead of using any specific numerical characteristic as the input feature, the probability density of RRIs from ECG conserves comprehensive statistical information; hence, is a natural and efficient input feature for AF detection. Incorporated with a support vector machine as the classifier, results on the MIT-BIH database indicates that the proposed method is a simple and accurate approach for AF detection in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity."
https://openalex.org/W4289834101,"With the EU Green Deal initiatives, European members seek to launch the first climate neutral continent by 2050. This paper assesses the stochastic convergence of per capita energy consumption series for an illustrative sample of 15 EU countries with memberships prior to the 2004 enlargement, using data spanning the 1970–2018 period. Results from the confidence interval subsampling (asymmetric and equal-tailed) highlight that 11 out of the 15 EU series exhibit a long-run memory behaviour, while a diverging pattern was observed for the UK, Germany, Portugal, and Italy. Finally, per capita energy use series persist but fail to reveal one of the above dynamics for Ireland and Spain. Also, findings from the non-parametric Bayesian application (ANOVA/linear Dependent Dirichlet Process (DDP) mixture model) show how economic growth operates as a converging energy consumption-enabler over the long-run, from which the EU membership cannot be excluded. In particular, we highlight how the nature of energy-GDP hypotheses vary with the stochastic properties of energy use (converging behaviour with temporary shocks, converging pattern with permanent shocks, and diverging dynamic). Finally, our conclusions overcome the well-established development stage argument as we claim that countries with similar energy convergence patterns may need to adopt similar energy policies."
https://openalex.org/W4289834269,"Impostor syndrome is characterized by fraudulent self-doubt and correlates with burnout, and adverse mental health.The objective was to investigate correlates of Impostor syndrome in a medical education cohort and determine if an interactive workshop can improve knowledge and perception of Impostor syndrome.From June 2019 to February 2021 interactive educational workshops were conducted for medical education cohorts. Participants completed baseline knowledge and Impostor syndrome self-identification surveys, participated in interactive presentations and discussions, followed by post-intervention surveys.There were 198 participants including 19% residents, 10% medical students, 30% faculty and 41% Graduate Medical Education (GME) administrators. Overall, 57% were positive for Impostor syndrome. Participants classified as the following Impostor syndrome competence subtypes: Expert = 42%; Soloist = 34%; Super-person = 31%; Perfectionist = 25%; and Natural Genius = 21%. Self-identified contributors of IS included: parent expectations = 72%, female gender = 58%, and academic rat race = 37%. GME administrators compared to physicians/medical students had significantly higher number of self-identified contributors to Impostor syndrome. Knowledge survey scores increased from 4.94 (SD = 2.8) to 5.78 (2.48) post intervention (p = 0.045). Participants with Impostor syndrome competence subtypes had increased perceptions of Impostor syndrome as a cause of stress, failure to reach full potential, and negative relationships/teamwork (p = 0.032 -<0.001).Impostor syndrome was common in this medical education cohort, and those with Impostor syndrome significantly attributed negative personal and professional outcomes to Impostor syndrome. An interactive workshop on Impostor syndrome can be used to increase perceptions and knowledge regarding Impostor syndrome. The materials can be adapted for relevance to various audiences."
https://openalex.org/W4289848652,"The cholinergic system is an important modulator of brain processes. It contributes to the regulation of several cognitive functions and emotional states, hence altering behaviors. Previous works showed that cholinergic (nicotinic) receptors of the prefrontal cortex are needed for adapted social behaviors. However, these data were obtained in mutant mice that also present alterations of several neurotransmitter systems, in addition to the cholinergic system. ChAT-IRES-Cre mice, that express the Cre recombinase specifically in cholinergic neurons, are useful tools to investigate the role of the cholinergic circuits in behavior. However, their own behavioral phenotype has not yet been fully characterized, in particular social behavior. In addition, the consequences of aging on the cholinergic system of ChAT-IRES-Cre mice has never been studied, despite the fact that aging is known to compromise the cholinergic system efficiency. The aim of the current study was thus to characterize the social phenotype of ChAT-IRES-Cre mice both at young (2–3 months) and middle (10–11 months) ages. Our results reveal an alteration of the cholinergic system, evidenced by a decrease of ChAT , CHT and VAChT gene expression in the striatum of the mice, that was accompanied by mild social disturbances and a tendency towards anxiety. Aging decreased social dominance, without being amplified by the cholinergic alterations. Altogether, this study shows that ChAT-IRES-Cre mice are useful models for studying the cholinergic system‘s role in social behavior using appropriate modulating technics (optogenetic or DREADD)."
https://openalex.org/W4289849045,"A quality detection system for the ""Red Fuji"" apple in Luochuan was designed for automatic grading. According to the Chinese national standard, the grading principles of apple appearance quality and Brix detection were determined. Based on machine vision and image processing, the classifier models of apple defect, contour, and size were constructed. And then, the grading thresholds were set to detect the defective pixel ratio t, aspect ratio λ, and the cross-sectional diameter Wp in the image of the apple. Spectral information of apples in the wavelength range of 400 nm~1000 nm was collected and the multiple scattering correction (MSC) and standard normal variable (SNV) transformation methods were used to preprocess spectral reflectance data. The competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS) algorithm and the successive projections algorithm (SPA) were used to extract characteristic wavelength points containing Brix information, and the CARS-PLS (partial least squares) algorithm was used to establish a Brix prediction model. Apple defect, contour, size, and Brix were combined as grading indicators. The apple quality online grading detection platform was built, and apple's comprehensive grading detection algorithm and upper computer software were designed. The experiments showed that the average accuracy of apple defect, contour, and size grading detection was 96.67%, 95.00%, and 94.67% respectively, and the correlation coefficient Rp of the Brix prediction set was 0.9469. The total accuracy of apple defect, contour, size, and Brix grading was 96.67%, indicating that the detection system designed in this paper is feasible to classify ""Red Fuji"" apple in Luochuan."
https://openalex.org/W4289849142,"Comprehensive data sets for lower-limb kinematics and kinetics during slope walking and running are important for understanding human locomotion neuromechanics and energetics and may aid the design of wearable robots (e.g., exoskeletons and prostheses). Yet, this information is difficult to obtain and requires expensive experiments with human participants in a gait laboratory. This study thus presents an empirical mathematical model that predicts lower-limb joint kinematics and kinetics during human walking and running as a function of surface gradient and stride cycle percentage. In total, 9 males and 7 females (age: 24.56 ± 3.16 years) walked at a speed of 1.25 m/s at five surface gradients (-15%, -10%, 0%, +10%, +15%) and ran at a speed of 2.25 m/s at five different surface gradients (-10%, -5%, 0%, +5%, +10%). Joint kinematics and kinetics were calculated at each surface gradient. We then used a Fourier series to generate prediction equations for each speed's slope (3 joints x 5 surface gradients x [angle, moment, mechanical power]), where the input was the percentage in the stride cycle. Next, we modeled the change in value of each Fourier series' coefficients as a function of the surface gradient using polynomial regression. This enabled us to model lower-limb joint angle, moment, and power as functions of the slope and as stride cycle percentages. The average adjusted R2 for kinematic and kinetic equations was 0.92 ± 0.18. Lastly, we demonstrated how these equations could be used to generate secondary gait parameters (e.g., joint work) as a function of surface gradients. These equations could be used, for instance, in the design of exoskeletons for walking and running on slopes to produce trajectories for exoskeleton controllers or for educational purposes in gait studies."
https://openalex.org/W4289849144,"Allergic reactions to medication range from mild to severe or even life-threatening. Proper documentation of patient allergy information is critical for safe prescription, avoiding drug interactions, and reducing healthcare costs. Allergy information is regularly obtained during the medical interview, but is often poorly documented in electronic health records (EHRs). While many EHRs allow for structured adverse drug reaction (ADR) reporting, a free-text entry is still common. The resulting information is neither interoperable nor easily reusable for other applications, such as clinical decision support systems and prescription alerts. Current approaches require pharmacists to review and code ADRs documented by healthcare professionals. Recently, the effectiveness of machine algorithms in natural language processing (NLP) has been widely demonstrated. Our study aims to develop and evaluate different NLP algorithms that can encode unstructured ADRs stored in EHRs into institutional symptom terms. Our dataset consists of 79,712 pharmacist-reviewed drug allergy records. We evaluated three NLP techniques: Naive Bayes—Support Vector Machine (NB-SVM), Universal Language Model Fine-tuning (ULMFiT), and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). We tested different general-domain pre-trained BERT models, including mBERT, XLM-RoBERTa, and WanchanBERTa, as well as our domain-specific AllergyRoBERTa, which was pre-trained from scratch on our corpus. Overall, BERT models had the highest performance. NB-SVM outperformed ULMFiT and BERT for several symptom terms that are not frequently coded. The ensemble model achieved an exact match ratio of 95.33%, a F 1 score of 98.88%, and a mean average precision of 97.07% for the 36 most frequently coded symptom terms. The model was then further developed into a symptom term suggestion system and achieved a Krippendorff’s alpha agreement coefficient of 0.7081 in prospective testing with pharmacists. Some degree of automation could both accelerate the availability of allergy information and reduce the efforts for human coding."
https://openalex.org/W4289782237,"Understanding the links between species and their environment is critical for species management. This is particularly true for organisms of medical and/or economic significance. The ‘Irukandji’ jellyfish ( Carukia barnesi) is well known for its small size, cryptic nature, and highly venomous sting. Being the namesake of the Irukandji syndrome, contact with this marine stinger often leads to hospitalization and can be fatal. Consequently, the annual occurrence of this organism is believed to cost the Australian government an estimated $AUD3 billion annually in medical costs and losses for tourism. Despite its economic importance the logistical difficulties related to surveying C . barnesi in situ has led to a paucity of knowledge regarding its ecology and significantly impeded management strategies to date. In this study, we use six years of direct C . barnesi capture data to explore patterns pertaining to the annual occurrence and abundance of this species in the nearshore waters of the Cairns coast. We provide novel insights into trends in medusae aggregations and size distribution and primarily focus on the potential role of environmental drivers for annual C . barnesi occurrence patterns. Using a two-part hurdle model, eight environmental parameters were investigated over four time periods for associations with records of medusa presence and abundance. Final models showed a small amount of variation in medusa presence and abundance patterns could be accounted for by long-term trends pertaining to rainfall and wind direction. However, the assessed environmental parameters could not explain high annual variation or site location effects. Ultimately best-fit models had very low statistical inference power explaining between 16 and 20% of the variance in the data, leaving approximately 80% of all variation in medusa presence and abundance unexplained."

In addition, since patients suffering from these conditions are often older adults, the presence of frailty syndrome could worsen the clinical situation.This study protocol of a prospective multi-center clinical trial, will be conducted at two hospitals of the Istituti Clinici Scientifici Maugeri IRCCS group, from July 2020 until December 2022. CHF and COPD older patients (age ≥65) will undergo a multidisciplinary assessment at admission, discharge and at 6 months follow-up, from an inpatient rehabilitation program: disease-related clinical characteristics, functional variables, cognitive screening, treatment adherence, anxiety, depression, QoL and frailty. The estimated sample size will consist of 300 patients.The expected results are related to the possibility of an improvement in the areas of intervention after the rehabilitative program and the maintenance of these improvements over time. The assessment of clinical and functional status, cognitive impairment, treatment adherence, psychosocial characteristics, and frailty could provide more specific and useful information about the main features to be considered in the evaluation and treatment of older patients suffering from CHF and COPD undergoing a rehabilitative pathway.The study has been registered on January 28, 2022 with the ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05230927 registration number (clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05230927)."
https://openalex.org/W4289782696,"The hadal amphipod Hirondellea gigas is an emblematic animal of the Pacific trenches, and has a number of special adaptations to thrive in this 'extreme' environment, which includes the deepest part of the Earth's ocean. One such adaptation that has been suggested is the presence of an 'aluminum gel shield' on the surface of its body in order to prevent the dissolution of calcitic exoskeleton below the carbonate compensation depth. However, this has not been investigated under experimental conditions that sufficiently prevent aluminum artefacts, and the possibility of other elements with similar characteristic X-ray energy as aluminum (such as bromine) has not been considered. Here, we show with new electron microscopy data gathered under optimized conditions to minimize aluminum artefacts that H. gigas actually does not have an aluminum shield-instead many parts of its body are enriched in bromine, particularly gastric ossicles and setae. Results from elemental analyses pointed to the use of calcite partially substituted with magnesium by H. gigas in its exoskeleton, in order to suppress dissolution. Our results exemplify the necessity of careful sample preparation and analysis of the signals in energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopic analysis, and the importance of analyses at different electron energies."
https://openalex.org/W4289834425,"The aim of the paper is to propose the construction of an index that captures the economic complexity of cities over the globe, as well as to explore whether it is a good predictor for a range of city-level economic outcomes. This index aspires to mitigate data scarcity for cities and to provide policy makers with the tools for monitoring the evolving role of cities in the global economy. Analytically, we implement the economic complexity methodology on data for the ownership, location and economic activities of the world's 3,000 largest firms and their subsidiaries to propose a new indicator that quantifies the network of the largest cities worldwide and the economic activities of their globalized firms. We first show that complex cities are the highly diversified cities that host non-ubiquitous economic activities of firms with global presence. Then, in a sample of EU cities, we show that complex cities tend to be more prosperous, have higher population, and are associated with more jobs, human capital, innovation, technology and transport infrastructure. Last, using OLS methodology and accounting for several other confounders, we show that a higher ECI, at the city level, enhances the resilience of cities to negative economic shocks, i.e., their ability to bounce back after a shock. Specifically, we find that the expected increase of the ratio of employment in 2012 over 2006 is 0.01 (mean: 0.992; standard deviation: 0.081) when the ECI increases by 1 unit (mean: 0.371; standard deviation: 1.094), i.e., a satisfactory pace of recovery, in terms of employment. The ability to diversify in the presence of a shock, the reallocation of factors of production to other sectors and the ability to extract rents associated with those diversified activities, uncovers the mechanics of the ECI index."

This study investigates intra-household gender dynamics and practices around sheep and goat production among smallholder farmers in South East region of Kenya. A quantitative study was conducted on 358 dual-headed (married) households to generate gender-disaggregated data on ownership, decision-making and labour allocation around small ruminant production. Qualitative data was collected through focused group discussions to bring out the community perspectives. From the findings, the average number of small ruminants owned by the households as reported by men was slightly higher than women. The average number of small ruminants solely owned by men was significantly higher than by women. Men reported a relatively higher number of jointly owned small ruminants compared to women. More women than men reported that they could give as a gift, sell-off and slaughter jointly owned small ruminants without consulting their spouses. Small ruminants were considered the most important livestock asset in supporting a household’s livelihood by relatively more women than men. Men had more decision-making autonomy over jointly owned small ruminants compared to women. Production tasks around small ruminants such as feeding, watering, selling milk and cleaning housing structures were mostly performed by the women. Qualitative data identified men as the de facto owners of small ruminants with a higher power position in making the important production decisions. The study offers three implications on the design of livestock interventions to empower women, the interventions should ensure that; 1) women are not just owners of livestock assets but also share power and decision-making rights in all aspects of production, 2) production labour is shared equitably between men and women and, 3) women access benefits from livestock production even when animals are owned by men."
https://openalex.org/W4289849097,"In the real world, acceptance of a decision is conditional on the availability of a great volume of data. Selection of a suitable solution on the basis of this data represents a problem that multi-criterial methods (MCDM) are applied to. The issue of which of these should be favoured during their use involves a specification of the importance of the assessed criteria. The goal of the presented research is to quantify the differences (symmetry) in assessment using selected MCDM methods (Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution-TOPSIS), while applying an absolute and relative variability of the assessed criteria to a determination of their importance. The obtained results indicate that the order of the assessed subject (alternative) is not directly influenced by the method of determining the variability of the assessed criteria. We can also state that the degree of concurrence in the order of application of the TOPSIS technique, in combination with both approaches expressed by the Jaccard index, is relatively low."

Osteoporosis in men is often underestimated. This study aimed to identify the causal risk factors associated with bone mineral density(BMD) in men. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with the exposures at the genome-wide significance (p < 5x10-8) level were obtained from corresponding genome-wide association studies (GWASs) and were utilized as instrumental variables. Summary-level statistical data for BMD were obtained from two large-scale UK Biobank GWASs. A Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was performed to identify causal risk factors for BMD. Regarding the BMD of the heel bone, the odds of BMD increased per 1-SD increase of free testosterone (FT) (OR = 1.13, P = 9.4 × 10-17), together with estradiol (E2) (OR = 2.51, P = 2.3 × 10-4). The odds of BMD also increased with the lowering of sex-hormone binding globulin (SHBG) (OR = 0.87, P = 7.4 × 10-8) and total testosterone (TT) (OR = 0.96, P = 3.2 × 10-2) levels. Regarding the BMD of the lumbar spine, the odds of BMD increased per 1-SD increase in FT (OR = 1.18, P = 4.0 × 10-3). Regarding the BMD of the forearm bone, the odds of BMD increased with lowering SHBG (OR = 0.75, P = 3.0 × 10-3) and TT (OR = 0.85, P = 3.0 × 10-3) levels. Our MR study corroborated certain causal relationships and provided genetic evidence among sex hormone traits, lifestyle factors and BMD. Furthermore, it is a novel insight that TT was defined as a disadvantage for osteoporosis in male European populations."

Harnessing ethnographic observations at five conferences and a text -analysis of 52 Reddit threads, we find both experts and lay patient-consumers navigate their own versions of ""productive uncertainty."" Experts develop genetic technologies to legitimize unsettled genomics as medical knowledge and mobilize resources and products, while lay patient-consumers turn to Internet forums to gain clarity on knowledge gaps that help better manage their genetic risk states. By showing how the uncertain nature of genomics serves as a productive force placing both parties within a mutually cooperative cycle, we argue that experts and patient-consumers co-produce a form of relational medicalization that concretizes ""risk"" itself as a disease state."

For brachyuran crabs, claw height and gut size are diet-specific and largely reflect foraging strategies, while abdomen width reflects relative levels of fecundity. However, the link between claw size and diet has largely been documented only for primarily carnivorous crabs, while the link between diet and fecundity is strong in herbivorous crabs. We sought to determine the nature of the intraspecific relationship between claw size, dietary habits, and fecundity for two primarily herbivorous crab species, Hemigrapsus sanguineus and Aratus pisonii . Specifically, we examined whether claw size and/or abdomen width can be used as reliable measures of individual diet strategy. To test these hypotheses, we collected crabs and measured the dimensions of their claws, abdomens, and guts. By comparing these dimensions for each individual, we found that strongly predictive relationships do not exist between these traits for the primarily herbivorous species in our study. Thus, identifying external morphological features that can be used to assess diets of primarily herbivorous crabs remains elusive."
https://openalex.org/W4289782455,"Objective Asthma is a common chronic illness affecting 19 million US adults. Inhaled corticosteroids are a safe and effective treatment for asthma, yet, medication adherence among patients remains poor. Shared decision-making, a patient activation strategy, can improve patient adherence to inhaled corticosteroids. This study aimed to explore whether audio-recorded patient-primary care provider encounters can be used to: 1. Evaluate the level of patient-perceived shared decision-making during the encounter, and 2. Predict levels of patient’s inhaled corticosteroid adherence. Materials and methods Shared decision-making and inhaled corticosteroid adherence were assessed using the SDM Questionnaire-9 and the Medication Adherence Report Scale for Asthma (MARS-A). Speech-to-text algorithms were used to automatically transcribe 80 audio-recorded encounters between primary care providers and asthmatic patients. Machine learning algorithms (Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, Decision Tree) were applied to achieve the study’s predictive goals. Results The accuracy of automated speech-to-text transcription was relatively high (ROUGE F-score = .9). Machine learning algorithms achieved good predictive performance for shared decision-making (the highest F-score = .88 for the Naive Bayes) and inhaled corticosteroid adherence (the highest F-score = .87 for the Support Vector Machines). Discussion This was the first study that trained machine learning algorithms on a dataset of audio-recorded patient-primary care provider encounters to successfully evaluate the quality of SDM and predict patient inhaled corticosteroid adherence. Conclusion Machine learning approaches can help primary care providers identify patients at risk for poor medication adherence and evaluate the quality of care by measuring levels of shared decision-making. Further work should explore the replicability of our results in larger samples and additional health domains."

Therefore, it is of great significance to adopt scientific, effective and comprehensive methods to evaluate development status of ecological civilization. Based on the panel data from 2010 to 2014, this paper employs GIS and AHP methods to dynamically examine the level of ecological civilization construction in Jiangxi Province. The results indicate that: (1) The ecological civilization construction in Jiangxi Province is 13.23% higher than the national average, whereas there is an imbalance in the development of different cities within the province; (2) The ecological civilization construction in the whole province rises first and then falls; (3) The performances of the cities vary in different dimensions of the construction of ecological civilization that cities in Jiangxi province perform well in the dimension of ecological environment, but perform poorly in the dimension of social development. Finally, we put forward policy recommendations for improving ecological environment to realize harmonious development between human and nature."
https://openalex.org/W4289782733,"In 2019, the South Korean government established a plan to develop home visitation services for pregnant women and women with children below the age of 24 months and expand the services nationwide. Therefore, a national survey was needed to provide relevant information for the policy decision of whether to implement universal home visitation services by nurses for families with young children. To determine home visitation service needs in South Korea, 804 women who were pregnant or had children below the age of 24 months were selected as survey participants through stratified random sampling by region reflecting geographical distribution in numbers of births. Of them, 614 responded to survey questionnaires delivered via email. After excluding surveys with too short of a response time, extreme values, and incomplete answers, 500 participants’ responses were analyzed. Participants indicated whether they supported the provision of home visitation services and whether they were willing to utilize home visitation services. The survey also elicited responses regarding the level of needs for individual service items that could be delivered by nurses during home visits. The fieldwork was conducted by a consulting and research firm. The differences in whether respondents supported nurse home visitation services and intended to use nurse home visitation services according to mothers’ characteristics were examined using the chi-square test. In total, 88.0% of survey participants supported nurse home visitation services, and 81.2% indicated that they intended to receive the services. Most pregnant women and women with children below the age of 24 months responded positively to the various prenatal or postpartum services that nurses could provide during home visits. The percentages of support for the services and intention to use services were generally high among subgroups according to mothers’ characteristics. Therefore, universal home visitation services by nurses during pregnancy and in the postnatal period would be received well by Korean women."
https://openalex.org/W4289833681,"Aims This study assessed lifestyle and health behavior habits among a representative sample of Saudi adolescents with self-reported diabetes and compared them to non-diabetic peers. Methods This was a nested case-control study, from the Jeeluna cohort, a nationwide, cross-sectional study of 12,575 Saudi boys and girls aged 10–19 years. Non-diabetic adolescents were matched to those with diabetes on a ratio of 4:1 based on age, gender and region. Retained information from the original study included: socio-demographics, lifestyle behaviors, tobacco/substance use, screen use, anthropometric measurements, and laboratory results. Results The prevalence of diabetes was 0.7% (n = 87). Overall, 65% of diabetic participants were males, and 22.4% aged ≤14 years. Overall, both groups had low rates of healthful habits in their diet and physical activity. Both groups had similar rates of tobacco use, and high digital screen time. Adolescents with diabetes had more consistent sleeping pattern, were more likely to be on a diet, thought they spent enough time with their physician and obtained medical information more often from their health clinic. They were also more likely to feel down and to chat more often. Conclusion Adolescents with diabetes remain far from guideline targets but seem predisposed to better lifestyle and have more access to health as compared to their non-diabetic peers."
https://openalex.org/W4289834042,"Control fabrication of metal-oxide nanocatalysts for electrochemical reactions has received considerable research attention. Here, manganese oxide (Mn3O4) nanorods modified indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes were prepared based on the in-situ one-step hydrothermal methods. The nanorods were well characterized using field emission scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared, and X-ray diffraction spectroscopy. The results showed the formation of pure crystalline Mn3O4 nanorods with a length of approximately 1.4 μm and a thickness of approximately 100 ± 30 nm. The Mn3O4 nanorod-modified ITO electrodes were used for accelerating urea electrochemical oxidation at room temperature using cyclic and square wave voltammetry techniques. The results indicated that the modified electrode demonstrated excellent electrocatalytic performance toward urea electrooxidation in an alkaline medium over concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 4 mol/L. The modified electrode showed high durability, attaining more than 88% of its baseline performance after 150 cycles; furthermore, the chronoamperometry technique demonstrated high stability. Thus, the Mn3O4 nanorod-modified ITO electrode is a promising anode for direct urea fuel cell applications."

In Tennessee (TN), declines in HIV among persons who inject drugs (PWID) stalled, and HCV infection rates increased significantly from 2013-2017. To better target strategies to address the syndemic, county-level socioeconomic, opioid use, access to healthcare, and health factors were modeled to identify indicators predictive of vulnerability to an HIV/HCV outbreak among PWID in TN.Newly reported chronic HCV cases among persons aged 13-39 years in 2016-2017 were used as a proxy for county-level HIV/HCV vulnerability among TN's 95 counties. Seventy-five publicly available county-level measures from 2016-2017 were collected and reduced through multiple dimension reduction techniques. Negative binomial regression identified indicators associated with HCV which were used to calculate county-level vulnerability to a local HIV/HCV outbreak.Thirteen county-level indicators were identified as strongly predictive of HIV/HCV vulnerability with the statistically significant indicators being percentage of the population aged 20-44 years, per capita income, teen birth rate, percentage of clients in TDMHSAS-funded opioid treatment and recovery, syphilis case rate, and percentage of homes with at least one vehicle. Based on the 13 indicators, we identified the distribution of vulnerability to an HIV/HCV outbreak among TN's counties. Eleven high vulnerability counties were identified, with the preponderance located in east and middle TN.This analysis identified the county-level factors most associated with vulnerability to an HIV/HCV outbreak among PWID in TN. These results, alongside routine surveillance, will guide targeted prevention and linkage to care efforts for the most vulnerable communities."
https://openalex.org/W4289849124,"Polyphenols in plants are important for defense responses against microorganisms, insect herbivory, and control of feeding. Owing to their antioxidant, anti-cancer, and anti-inflammatory activities, their importance in human nutrition has been acknowledged. However, metabolism of polyphenols derived from mulberry leaves in silkworms (Bombyx mori) remains unclear. Sulfotransferases (SULT) are involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics and endogenous compounds. The purpose of this study is to investigate the metabolic mechanism of polyphenols mediated by B. mori SULT. Here, we identified a novel SULT in silkworms (herein, swSULT ST3). Recombinant swSULT ST3 overexpressed in Escherichia coli effectively sulfated polyphenols present in mulberry leaves. swSULT ST3 showed high specific activity toward genistein among the polyphenols. Genistein-7-sulfate was produced by the activity of swSULT ST3. Higher expression of swSULT ST3 mRNA was observed in the midgut and fat body than in the hemocytes, testis, ovary, and silk gland. Polyphenols inhibited the aldo-keto reductase detoxification of reactive aldehydes from mulberry leaves, and the most noticeable inhibition was observed with genistein. Our results suggest that swSULT ST3 plays a role in the detoxification of polyphenols, including genistein, and contributes to the effects of aldo-keto reductase in the midgut of silkworms. This study provides new insight into the functions of SULTs and the molecular mechanism responsible for host plant selection in lepidopteran insects."
https://openalex.org/W4289849618,"In Botswana, cervical cancer is the leading cause of cancer death for females. With limited resources, Botswana is challenged to ensure equitable access to advanced cancer care. Botswana's capital city, Gaborone, houses the only gynecologic oncology multi-disciplinary team (MDT) and the one chemoradiation facility in the country. We aimed to identify areas where fewer women were presenting to the MDT clinic for care.This cross-sectional study examined cervical cancer patients presenting to the MDT clinic between January 2015 and March 2020. Patients were geocoded to residential sub-districts to estimate age-standardized presentation rates. Global Moran's I and Anselin Local Moran's I tested the null hypothesis that presentation rates occurred randomly in Botswana. Community- and individual-level factors of patients living in sub-districts identified with higher (HH) and lower (LL) clusters of presentation rates were examined using ordinary least squares with a spatial weights matrix and multivariable logistic regression, respectively, with α level 0.05.We studied 990 patients aged 22-95 (mean: 50.6). Presentation rates were found to be geographically clustered across the country (p = 0.01). Five sub-districts were identified as clusters, two high (HH) sub-district clusters and three low (LL) sub-district clusters (mean presentation rate: 35.5 and 11.3, respectively). Presentation rates decreased with increased travel distance (p = 0.033). Patients residing in LL sub-districts more often reported abnormal vaginal bleeding (aOR: 5.62, 95% CI: 1.31-24.15) compared to patients not residing in LL sub-districts. Patients in HH sub-districts were less likely to be living with HIV (aOR: 0.59; 95% CI: 0.38-0.90) and more likely to present with late-stage cancer (aOR: 1.78; 95%CI: 1.20-2.63) compared to patients not in HH sub-districts.This study identified geographic clustering of cervical cancer patients presenting for care in Botswana and highlighted sub-districts with disproportionately lower presentation rates. Identified community- and individual level-factors associated with low presentation rates can inform strategies aimed at improving equitable access to cervical cancer care."
https://openalex.org/W4289849819,"Background In a range of setting, detecting and generate empirical information on the cause of infant death and contributing risk factors at population level is basically utmost essential to take evidence-based measures in reducing infant morbidity and mortality. An electronic verbal autopsy is suitable tool and best alternative solution to determine individuals’ cause of death in a setting where the majority of deaths occur at home and civil registration systems do not exist. The present study was undertaken to find out cause of infant death, applying computer-based probabilistic model (InterVA-4) and analyze the patterns of association factors of mother’s and the deceased infant’s characteristics to the leading cause-specific infant mortality in Eastern Ethiopia. Methods The study employed a community-based prospective longitudinal survey, which was conducted with routinely enumeration of reported infant deaths for a period of two years (from September 2016 to August 2018) in Eastern part of Ethiopia. Using the two-stage cluster sampling technique, the study was undertaken in four randomly selected districts of West Hararghe zone and two districts of zone 3 in Oromia and Afar regional state, respectively. The study included a total of 362 infants who were deceased during the study period. Data was collected by trained enumerators by interviewing the mothers or guardians of the deceased infant using a 2014 standardize World Health Organization (WHO) Verbal Autopsy questionnaire. InterVA-4 model were used for processing and interpreting verbal autopsy data in order to arrive at the most likely causes of infant death. SPSS version 23 was also used for statistical analysis of frequency distribution and logistic regression for the association between covariates and outcomes. Findings Of the overall (362) deceased infants’ during the study period, 53.0% of deaths occurred during neonatal time while 47.0% died in the post-neonatal period. Acute respiratory infection including neonatal and post-neonatal pneumonia (38.4%), birth asphyxia (16.4%), diarrheal diseases (16.3%), prematurity (7.4%) and malaria (4.3%) were found to be the leading causes of infant mortality in the study area. The independent factors strongly associated with probable ARI, including pneumonia related mortality as compared to all-causes of death were infants with maternal age lower than 20 years old (p = 0.001, AOR: 4.82, 95% CI: 1.88, 12.3) and infant being died outside of heath facilities (P = 0.007, AOR: 2.85, 95% CI: 1.33, 6.12). The post-neonatal period (P = 0.000, AOR: 15.5, 95% CI: 6.35, 37.8) and infant died in the wet season (P = 0.006, AOR: 2.38, 95% CI: 1.28, 4.44) had strong relationship with dying from diarrhea-related death than those infants died from all non-diarrhea. The death due to malaria robustly associated with infants whose mothers age between 20–35 years old (P = 0.024, AOR: 4.44, 95% CI: 1.22, 16.2) and infant who was dwelled in the districts of Afar region (P = 0.013, AOR: 4.08, 95% CI: 1.35, 12.4). Conclusion The highest cause of infant mortality was associated with disease of respiratory system, particularly acute respiratory infection, including both neonates and post-neonatal pneumonia. Most of the infant deaths existed are as a result of diseases and conditions that are readily preventable or treatable cause, similar to those reported in worldwide, which have needs of further attention. The patterns of significant associated factors across cause-specific mortality against all-cause of death were dissimilar. Therefore, strengthen maternal and child health program with effective preventive interventions emphasizing on the most common cause of infant deaths and those factors contributing in raising mortality risk are required."
https://openalex.org/W4289850183,"This study examined factors associated with TB among persons living with HIV (PLWH) in Florida and the agreement between self-reported and medically documented history of tuberculosis (TB) in assessing the risk factors.Self-reported and medically documented data of 655 PLWH in Florida were analyzed. Data on sociodemographic factors such as age, race/ethnicity, place of birth, current marital status, education, employment, homelessness in the past year and 'ever been jailed' and behavioural factors such as excessive alcohol use, marijuana, injection drug use (IDU), substance and current cigarette use were obtained. Health status information such as health insurance status, adherence to HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART), most recent CD4 count, HIV viral load and comorbid conditions were also obtained. The associations between these selected factors with self-reported TB and medically documented TB diagnosis were compared using Chi-square and logistic regression analyses. Additionally, the agreement between self-reports and medical records was assessed.TB prevalence according to self-reports and medical records was 16.6% and 7.5% respectively. Being age ≥55 years, African American and homeless in the past 12 months were statistically significantly associated with self-reported TB, while being African American homeless in the past 12 months and not on antiretroviral therapy (ART) were statistically significantly associated with medically documented TB. African Americans compared to Whites had odds ratios of 3.04 and 4.89 for self-reported and medically documented TB, respectively. There was moderate agreement between self-reported and medically documented TB (Kappa = 0.41).TB prevalence was higher based on self-reports than medical records. There was moderate agreement between the two data sources, showing the importance of self-reports. Establishing the true prevalence of TB and associated risk factors in PLWH for developing policies may therefore require the use of self-reports and confirmation by screening tests, clinical signs and/or microbiologic data."

SMILE focuses primarily on promoting healthy diet, physical activity and weight loss.A qualitative study with semi-structured interviews was conducted using purposive sampling. Interviews were conducted with 15 clients and 13 health care professionals (HCPs). Data were analysed according to a thematic analysis.Four overall themes were identified: interest in a lifestyle programme; group-based setting; changes in lifestyle behaviour; and preconditions for changing health behaviour. The results showed that clients valued the programme and were interested in the subject of lifestyle. The group-based setting was seen as a positive and important aspect of the intervention. Making lifestyle changes was acknowledged as difficult, especially in combination with the presence of psychiatric symptoms. Clients acquired an improved awareness of different aspects related to lifestyle behaviour. Irrespective of weight loss achieved, clients found their efforts successful with relatively 'small' changes. Some needed more support during the intervention than others. The practical activities in group sessions were regarded as most useful. HCPs were enthusiastic about the programme and their interactions with lifestyle improvements.The results of this study shed light on different aspects that were considered important when delivering a lifestyle intervention to people with SMI. We recommend considering these aspects when implementing a lifestyle intervention in a mental health care setting for clients with SMI."
https://openalex.org/W4289782157,"The recent return of Atlantic bluefin tuna to northern Europe following the recovery of the east Atlantic stock has sparked substantial public and scientific interest. This is particularly true for recreational anglers in Denmark, who often consider Atlantic bluefin tuna to be the catch of a lifetime. This attitude has previously sustained a substantial recreational fishery for bluefin tuna with annual tournaments in Denmark, which peaked in the 1950s before the subsequent collapse of the stock during the 1960s. Several scientific tagging programs have recruited recreational anglers in recent years to help catch and release tagged bluefin tuna. The anglers' investment of time and money in the scientific tagging projects indicate that the recreational fishery could recover in the future. However, the economic aspects of a potential future recreational bluefin tuna fishery remain unknown. We surveyed anglers participating in a scientific catch and release bluefin tuna fishery in Denmark across three years (2018-2020) and calculated the total annual expenditures associated with the activities. Additionally, we estimated the magnitude of the negative impact (i.e., incidental mortalities) on the bluefin tuna stock. Our results show that total annual expenditures by the recreational anglers approached 1,439,540€, totaling 4,318,620€ between 2018 and 2020. We found that recreational bluefin tuna anglers had mean annual expenditures directly related to the bluefin tuna fishing between 7,047€ and 2,176€ with an associated mortality impact on the stock of less than 1 tonne annually. By comparing the mortality impact to the expenditures, we estimate that each dead Atlantic bluefin tuna during the three study years generated 398,163€ in mean annual expenditures, equivalent to approximately 1636€ kg-1. Our study demonstrates significant economic expenditures among recreational anglers who target Atlantic bluefin tuna. This provides a clear example of how a recovery of marine natural capital and related ecosystem services can support development in the blue economy."

We used an outlier approach based on different statistics, including PBS, xpEHH, iHS, CLR, Tajima’s D, as well as two recently developed methods: Graph-aware Retrieval of Selective Sweeps (GRoSS) and Ascertained Sequentially Markovian Coalescent (ASMC). In order to minimize the risk of false positives, we selected regions that are outliers in all the samples included in the study using more than one method. We identified putative selection signals in 107 regions encompassing 434 genes. Many of the regions overlap with only one gene. The signals observed using microarray-based data are very consistent with our analyses using high-coverage sequencing data, as well as those identified with a novel coalescence-based method (ASMC). Importantly, at least 24 of these genomic regions have been identified in previous selection scans in South Asian populations or in other population groups. Our study highlights genomic regions that may have played a role in the adaptation of anatomically modern humans to novel environmental conditions after the out of Africa migration."

https://openalex.org/W4289833737,"Determining the dynamics of where and when individuals occur is necessary to understand population declines and identify critical areas for populations of conservation concern. However, there are few examples where a spatially and temporally explicit model has been used to evaluate the migratory dynamics of a bird population across its entire annual cycle. We used geolocator-derived migration tracks of 84 Dunlin ( Calidris alpina ) on the East Asian-Australasian Flyway (EAAF) to construct a migratory network describing annual subspecies-specific migration patterns in space and time. We found that Dunlin subspecies exhibited unique patterns of spatial and temporal flyway use. Spatially, C . a . arcticola predominated in regions along the eastern edge of the flyway (e.g., western Alaska and central Japan), whereas C . a . sakhalina predominated in regions along the western edge of the flyway (e.g., N China and inland China). No individual Dunlin that wintered in Japan also wintered in the Yellow Sea, China seas, or inland China, and vice-versa. However, similar proportions of the 4 subspecies used many of the same regions at the center of the flyway (e.g., N Sakhalin Island and the Yellow Sea). Temporally, Dunlin subspecies staggered their south migrations and exhibited little temporal overlap among subspecies within shared migration regions. In contrast, Dunlin subspecies migrated simultaneously during north migration. South migration was also characterized by individuals stopping more often and for more days than during north migration. Taken together, these spatial-temporal migration dynamics indicate Dunlin subspecies may be differentially affected by regional habitat change and population declines according to where and when they occur. We suggest that the migration dynamics presented here are useful for guiding on-the-ground survey efforts to quantify subspecies’ use of specific sites, and to estimate subspecies’ population sizes and long-term trends. Such studies would significantly advance our understanding of Dunlin space-time dynamics and the coordination of Dunlin conservation actions across the EAAF."

Robustness tests are conducted using placebo tests and event study methods. The study finds that (1) rising labor costs significantly increase private firms' R&D investment and that this effect has significant lag and cumulative effects; (2) private industrial firms (especially above-scale private industrial firms) are more affected by rising labor costs than other private firms and have more incentives to increase innovation investment; and (3) innovation investment of below-scale private industrial firms is not significantly affected by rising labor costs."

Participants were randomly selected from the general population after proportional allocation by region, sex, and age. Selected participants received a questionnaire that included demographic information, socioeconomic and marital statuses, prior recognition of live donor kidney transplantation, expected changes after donation, and the need for support after donor nephrectomy. Among the 1,000 participants from the web-based survey, 83.8% answered they fully understood living donor kidney transplantation, 81.1% knew about them, and 51.1% were willing to donate. Various complications after nephrectomy and deterioration in health after donation were the most significant reasons for those reluctant to donate. Most agreed that the government should provide social and economic support to living kidney donors, especially after exposure to the description of donor nephrectomy. Financial support, including surgery and regular medical check-up costs, was the most preferred government support. The Korean general population seemed aware of the value and safety of kidney donation, although only half of them were willing to donate due to concerns about possible complications. Most participants agreed on social and economic support for living kidney donors, especially surgery-related costs."
https://openalex.org/W4289847485,"Introduction Many instruments for assessing general parenting have been reported as burdensome and are thus seldom used in studies exploring children’s energy balance-related behaviors or weight. This study evaluates the factorial structure of the item-reduced version of the Comprehensive General Parenting Questionnaire (CGPQ), which assesses five constructs of general parenting. Methods The study uses data from two cross-sectional studies: Study 1 in 2014 (n = 173) and Study 2 in 2015–16 (n = 805). Parents of children aged three to six answered the CGPQ; in Study 1 the 69-item version, and in Study 2 the 29-item version. The reduction was based on the results of the confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) in Study 1. In both datasets, internal consistency, as Cronbach’s alphas and intraclass correlations between the items of each construct, was tested. A combined assessment of the CFA and items response theory evaluated the construct validity and the item importance for the 29-item version, and a further the reduced 22-item version. Results In Study 1, the highest Cronbach’s alphas were shown for the five constructs in the 69-item version. A higher intraclass correlation was found between the constructs in the 69- and 29-item versions, than between the 69- and the 22-item version. However, a high concordance was found between the constructs in the 29- and 22-item versions in both Study 1 and in Study 2 (0.76–1.00). Testing the goodness-of-fit of the CFA models revealed that the 22-item model fulfilled all the criteria, showing that it had a better factorial structure than the 29-item model. Standard estimations ranged from 0.20 to 0.76 in the 22-item version. Conclusion The reduced 22- and 29-item versions of the 69-item CGPQ showed good model fit, the 22-item version the better of the two. These short versions can be used to assess general parenting without overburdening the respondents."

In this study, we analyzed hospitals’ long-term assets acquisitions data extracted from the Medicare Cost Report, a mandatory annual filing for all Medicare-certified hospitals. The first objective of this study is to examine the time trend of land, buildings, and equipment acquisitions of all general acute care hospitals in the U.S. from 2005 to 2019 to understand the relative magnitude and temporal changes for the operating assets. The second objective is to examine the 15-year accumulated acquisitions of land, buildings, and equipment per capita in each state to understand the variations of potential access to hospital operating resources across states. To understand the longitudinal changes in acquisitions of operating assets for each year from 2005 to 2019, we calculated the total acquisition amounts across all hospitals for land, buildings, and equipment, respectively, and adjusted the amounts to 2019 dollars based on the consumer price index (CPI). For each state (including Washington D.C.) and the whole nation, the 15-year accumulated CPI-adjusted acquisition amounts per capita for land, buildings, and equipment were also calculated, respectively. The nationwide acquisitions of those operating assets grew rapidly from 2005 to 2008 followed by a negative overall growth from 2008 to 2014 and since 2015, started increasing steadily again. In 2019, U.S. general acute care hospitals acquired $3.0 billion of land, $44.6 billion of buildings, and $33.9 billion of equipment. Huge geographical variation in per capita cumulative total asset investment were also found with the first place North Dakota having a per capita investment that is almost four times higher than that in the lowest ranked state of Alabama."
https://openalex.org/W4289847858,"The evaluation or metrology of commercial bank management efficiency is the core of its effective management. The existing management efficiency of commercial banks adopts evaluation scheme rather than metrology. There are four shortcomings with the evaluation scheme, the evaluation is a ranking of advantages and/or disadvantages, all objects should participate in the evaluation, the evaluation results are valid only for the evaluated objects, and the evaluation results lack the metrology benchmark of the object domain. To address this issue, the paper presents a method to determine the benchmark of management efficiency, which is similar to the unit ""meter"" in the metrology of ""length"" and the unit ""scale"" in the metrology of ""management efficiency"". Firstly, the method of cluster analysis is used to solve the problem of attribute metrology base of management efficiency metrology. Based on the master of certain attribute data of commercial bank management efficiency metrology, cluster analysis is carried out onto the attribute data, and its characteristics and patterns are mined to determine the candidate benchmark set. Secondly, in the candidate datum set, k-means method is used to determine the metrology attribute datum to obtain the general metrology attributes. Finally, the absolute metrology of management efficiency is carried out for any commercial bank according to the benchmark, and the validity and feasibility of the benchmark are verified with an example. In such a way, the deficiencies of four aspects of evaluation are solved. Such a strategy can be adapted to different banks at any different time for their respective measurement, which extends the clustering statistical methods for attribute datum determination. The results can be applied to some other fields wherein object metrology is the basic task."
https://openalex.org/W4289848144,"This study provides an accurate and efficient method to reconstruct detailed and high-resolution digital 3D models of carpological materials by photogrammetric method, in which only about 100 to 150 images are required for each model reconstruction. The 3D models reflect the realistic morphology and genuine color of the carpological materials. The 3D models are scaled to represent the true size of the materials even as small as 3 mm in diameter. The interfaces are interactive, in which the 3D models can be rotated in 360° to observe the structures and be zoomed to inspect the macroscopic details. This new platform is beneficial for developing a virtual herbarium of carpological collection which is thus the most important to botanical authentication and education."

These examinations are performed at different times of the day and at different maternal meal states. In uncomplicated pregnancies, we assessed the effect of a standardized maternal meal on middle cerebral artery (MCA) and umbilical artery (UA) Doppler blood flow velocity pulsatility indices (PIs) and MCA peak systolic velocity (PSV).In this prospective single-blinded crossover study 25 healthy women were examined at 36 weeks of pregnancy. The first examination was performed in the morning following overnight fast, and repeated after extended fast (state A), and after a standard breakfast meal (state B).Irrespective of maternal prandial status, the MCA-PI values were lower in the 2nd compared to the 1st examination (-0.187; p = 0.071, and -0.113; p = 0.099, state A and B, respectively). Compared to the values in the 1st examination, the UA-PI values, were higher after extended fast (0.014; p = 0.436), and lower post-prandially (-0.036; p = 0.070). The difference (state B minus state A) between the meal states were not significant (0.074; p = 0.487 and -0.050; p = 0.058, for MCA-PI and UA-PI, respectively). Adjusting for the possible influence of fetal heart rate on MCA-PI and UA-PI, the differences between meal states remained non-significant (p = 0.179, p = 0.064, respectively). The MCA-PSV values increased after the meal (6.812; p = 0.035), whereas no increase was observed following extended fast (0.140; p = 0.951). The difference in MCA-PSV values between the two meal states was not significant (6.672; p = 0.055).Our results demonstrate possible diurnal variations in MCA-PI and UA-PI, with and without adjustment for fetal heart rate, that seem to be unaffected by maternal meal intake in healthy pregnancies."
https://openalex.org/W4289850482,"The purpose of this study was to identify molecular mechanisms by which the liver influences total lesion burden in a nonhuman primate model (NHP) of cardiovascular disease with acute and chronic feeding of a high cholesterol, high fat (HCHF) diet. Baboons (47 females, 64 males) were fed a HCHF diet for 2 years (y); liver biopsies were collected at baseline, 7 weeks (w) and 2y, and lesions were quantified in aortic arch, descending aorta, and common iliac at 2y. Unbiased weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) revealed several modules of hepatic genes correlated with lesions at different time points of dietary challenge. Pathway and network analyses were performed to study the roles of hepatic module genes. More significant pathways were observed in males than females. In males, we found modules enriched for genes in oxidative phosphorylation at baseline, opioid signaling at 7w, and EIF2 signaling and HNF1A and HNF4A networks at baseline and 2y. One module enriched for fatty acid β oxidation pathway genes was found in males and females at 2y. To our knowledge, this is the first study of a large NHP cohort to identify hepatic genes that correlate with lesion burden. Correlations of baseline and 7w module genes with lesions at 2y were observed in males but not in females. Pathway analyses of baseline and 7w module genes indicate EIF2 signaling, oxidative phosphorylation, and μ-opioid signaling are possible mechanisms that predict lesion formation induced by HCHF diet consumption in males. Our findings of coordinated hepatic transcriptional response in male baboons but not female baboons indicate underlying molecular mechanisms differ between female and male primate atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W4289851182,"Ideally, a patient's response to medication can be monitored by measuring changes in performance of some activity. In observational studies, however, any detected association between treatment (""on-medication"" vs ""off-medication"") and the outcome (performance in the activity) might be due to confounders. In particular, causal inferences at the personalized level are especially vulnerable to confounding effects that arise in a cyclic fashion. For quick acting medications, effects can be confounded by circadian rhythms and daily routines. Using the time-of-the-day as a surrogate for these confounders and the performance measurements as captured on a smartphone, we propose a personalized statistical approach to disentangle putative treatment and ""time-of-the-day"" effects, that leverages conditional independence relations spanned by causal graphical models involving the treatment, time-of-the-day, and outcome variables. Our approach is based on conditional independence tests implemented via standard and temporal linear regression models. Using synthetic data, we investigate when and how residual autocorrelation can affect the standard tests, and how time series modeling (namely, ARIMA and robust regression via HAC covariance matrix estimators) can remedy these issues. In particular, our simulations illustrate that when patients perform their activities in a paired fashion, positive autocorrelation can lead to conservative results for the standard regression approach (i.e., lead to deflated true positive detection), whereas negative autocorrelation can lead to anticonservative behavior (i.e., lead to inflated false positive detection). The adoption of time series methods, on the other hand, leads to well controlled type I error rates. We illustrate the application of our methodology with data from a Parkinson's disease mobile health study."
https://openalex.org/W4289851330,"A growing number of organisations, including medical associations, recommend that research subjects should be given the option of being informed about the general outcome and results of the study. We recently completed a study involving nine serosurveys from 2018 to 2020 in five districts of India among three age groups (children 9 months to < 5 years; 5 to < 15 years of age, and women 15 to < 50 years of age before and after the measles and rubella (MR) vaccination campaigns). In Palghar district of Maharashtra all individuals in 30 selected clusters were enumerated, and 13 individuals per age group were randomly sampled. We established the procedures to return the results to the respondents for each stage of the survey. Of the 1,166 individuals selected for the measles and rubella serosurvey, 971 (83%) agreed to participate and were enrolled. Participants were informed that they will only be contacted if they test seronegative for measles and/or rubella antibodies. Overall, 140 individuals enrolled in the survey tested seronegative for IgG antibodies to measles and/or rubella viruses; were provided the reports and informed to seek medical advice. Upon follow up by phone, 10% (14) of the 140 participants reported to have been vaccinated. In this paper we discuss the procedures, experiences and considerations in returning results to participants in a community-based measles and rubella serosurvey. Although the lessons learned are specific to post measles-rubella vaccine campaign serosurvey in India, they might be helpful to those contemplating sharing results to participants of large scale survey settings."
