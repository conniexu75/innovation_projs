https://openalex.org/W2066127116,"Voyager 1 plasma flow data are compared with a recent theory that predicted measurable departures from rigid corotation in Jupiter's magnetosphere as a consequence of rapid plasma production and weak atmosphere-magnetosphere coupling. The comparison indicates that the theory can account for the observed corotation lag, provided that the plasma mass production rate during the Voyager 1 encounter was rather larger than expected, namely approximately 10(30) atomic mass units per second."
https://openalex.org/W2076024715,"A conservation-of-energy equation has been derived for the spatially averaged magma temperature in a spherical pluton undergoing simultaneous crystallization and both internal (magma) and external (hydrothermal fluid) thermal convection. The model accounts for the dependence of magma viscosity on crystallinity, temperature, and bulk composition; it includes latent heat effects and the effects of different initial water concentrations in the melt and quantitatively considers the role that large volumes of circulatory hydrothermal fluids play in dissipating heat. The nonlinear ordinary differential equation describing these processes has been solved for a variety of magma compositions, initial termperatures, initial crystallinities, volume ratios of hydrothermal fluid to magma, and pluton sizes. These calculations are graphically summarized in plots of the average magma temperature versus time after emplacement. Solidification times, defined as the time necessary for magma to cool from the initial emplacement temperature to the solidus temperature vary as R(1,3), where R is the pluton radius. The solidification time of a pluton with a radius of 1 kilometer is 5 x 10(4) years; for an otherwise identical pluton with a radius of 10 kilometers, the solidification time is approximately 10(6) years. The water content has a marked effect on the solidification time. A granodiorite pluton with a radius of 5 kilometers and either 0.5 or 4 percent (by weight) water cools in 3.3 x 10(5) or 5 x 10(4) years, respectively. Convection solidification times are usually but not always less than conduction cooling times."
https://openalex.org/W2036189856,"The complex, highly patterned, invertebrate burrow systems known as ""graphoglyptids"" in ancient sedimentary rocks have now been recovered in box cores of modern deep-sea sediment. Spiroraphe, Cosmoraphe, and Paleodictyon occur as grooves in the tops of washed cores, and they apparently were produced and maintained as horizontal tunnel systems just a few millimeters below the sediment surface. These burrows, which are important as indicators of deepwater sedimentary environments in ancient strata, have been predicted in the modern deep sea but have not been found there until now."

https://openalex.org/W2023718878,"Energy requirements were calculated for the agricultural and the industrial phase of ethyl alcohol production from sugarcane grown in Louisiana. Agricultural energy requirements comprised 54 percent of all energy inputs, with machinery, fuel, and nitrogen fertilizer representing most of the energy subsidies. Overall net energy benefits (output:input) for alcohol production ranged from 1.8:1 to 0.9:1 depending on whether crop residues or fossil fuels were used for industrial processes."
