https://openalex.org/W4221018380,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus remains a global public health crisis. Although widespread vaccination campaigns are underway, their efficacy is reduced owing to emerging variants of concern1,2. Development of host-directed therapeutics and prophylactics could limit such resistance and offer urgently needed protection against variants of concern3,4. Attractive pharmacological targets to impede viral entry include type-II transmembrane serine proteases (TTSPs) such as TMPRSS2; these proteases cleave the viral spike protein to expose the fusion peptide for cell entry, and thus have an essential role in the virus lifecycle5,6. Here we identify and characterize a small-molecule compound, N-0385, which exhibits low nanomolar potency and a selectivity index of higher than 106 in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung cells and in donor-derived colonoids7. In Calu-3 cells it inhibits the entry of the SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), P.1 (Gamma) and B.1.617.2 (Delta). Notably, in the K18-human ACE2 transgenic mouse model of severe COVID-19, we found that N-0385 affords a high level of prophylactic and therapeutic benefit after multiple administrations or even after a single administration. Together, our findings show that TTSP-mediated proteolytic maturation of the spike protein is critical for SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo, and suggest that N-0385 provides an effective early treatment option against COVID-19 and emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern."
https://openalex.org/W4220864844,"Many age-dependent neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, are characterized by abundant inclusions of amyloid filaments. Filamentous inclusions of the proteins tau, amyloid-β, α-synuclein and transactive response DNA-binding protein (TARDBP; also known as TDP-43) are the most common1,2. Here we used structure determination by cryogenic electron microscopy to show that residues 120-254 of the lysosomal type II transmembrane protein 106B (TMEM106B) also form amyloid filaments in human brains. We determined the structures of TMEM106B filaments from a number of brain regions of 22 individuals with abundant amyloid deposits, including those resulting from sporadic and inherited tauopathies, amyloid-β amyloidoses, synucleinopathies and TDP-43 proteinopathies, as well as from the frontal cortex of 3 individuals with normal neurology and no or only a few amyloid deposits. We observed three TMEM106B folds, with no clear relationships between folds and diseases. TMEM106B filaments correlated with the presence of a 29-kDa sarkosyl-insoluble fragment and globular cytoplasmic inclusions, as detected by an antibody specific to the carboxy-terminal region of TMEM106B. The identification of TMEM106B filaments in the brains of older, but not younger, individuals with normal neurology indicates that they form in an age-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W4226051317,"The effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and therapeutic antibodies have been limited by the continuous emergence of viral variants and by the restricted diffusion of antibodies from circulation into the sites of respiratory virus infection. Here, we report the identification of two highly conserved regions on the Omicron variant receptor-binding domain recognized by broadly neutralizing antibodies. Furthermore, we generated a bispecific single-domain antibody that was able to simultaneously and synergistically bind these two regions on a single Omicron variant receptor-binding domain as revealed by cryo-EM structures. We demonstrated that this bispecific antibody can be effectively delivered to lung via inhalation administration and exhibits exquisite neutralization breadth and therapeutic efficacy in mouse models of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Importantly, this study also deciphered an uncommon and highly conserved cryptic epitope within the spike trimeric interface that may have implications for the design of broadly protective SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W4220776729,"Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is the third most common neurodegenerative condition after Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases1. FTLD typically presents in 45 to 64 year olds with behavioural changes or progressive decline of language skills2. The subtype FTLD-TDP is characterized by certain clinical symptoms and pathological neuronal inclusions with TAR DNA-binding protein (TDP-43) immunoreactivity3. Here we extracted amyloid fibrils from brains of four patients representing four of the five FTLD-TDP subclasses, and determined their structures by cryo-electron microscopy. Unexpectedly, all amyloid fibrils examined were composed of a 135-residue carboxy-terminal fragment of transmembrane protein 106B (TMEM106B), a lysosomal membrane protein previously implicated as a genetic risk factor for FTLD-TDP4. In addition to TMEM106B fibrils, we detected abundant non-fibrillar aggregated TDP-43 by immunogold labelling. Our observations confirm that FTLD-TDP is associated with amyloid fibrils, and that the fibrils are formed by TMEM106B rather than TDP-43. Amyloid fibrils extracted from brains of patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TAR DNA-binding-protein immunoreactivity (FTLD-TDP) are made up of transmembrane protein 106B."
https://openalex.org/W4220773518,"Pyroptosis is an inflammatory form of programmed cell death that is executed by the gasdermin (GSDM)-N domain of GSDM family proteins, which form pores in the plasma membrane. Although pyroptosis acts as a host defense against invasive pathogen infection, its role in the pathogenesis of enterovirus 71 (EV71) infection is unclear. In the current study, we found that EV71 infection induces cleavage of GSDM E (GSDME) by using western blotting analysis, an essential step in the switch from caspase-3-mediated apoptosis to pyroptosis. We show that this cleavage is independent of the 3C and 2A proteases of EV71. However, caspase-3 activation is essential for this cleavage, as GSDME could not be cleaved in caspase-3-KO cells upon EV71 infection. Further analyses showed that EV71 infection induced pyroptosis in WT cells but not in caspase-3/GSDME double-KO cells. Importantly, GSDME is required to induce severe disease during EV71 infection, as GSDME deficiency in mice was shown to alleviate pathological symptoms. In conclusion, our results reveal that GSDME is important for the pathogenesis of EV71 via mediating initiation of pyroptosis."
https://openalex.org/W4225415221,"AlkB homolog 5 (ALKBH5) has been revealed as a key RNA N6 -methyladenosine (m6 A) demethylase that is implicated in development and diseases. However, the function of ALKBH5 in TGF-β-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and tumor metastasis of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains unknown. Here, we firstly show that ALKBH5 expression is significantly reduced in metastatic NSCLC. ALKBH5 overexpression inhibits TGF-β-induced EMT and invasion of NSCLC cells, whereas ALKBH5 knockdown promotes the corresponding phenotypes. ALKBH5 overexpression suppresses TGF-β-stimulated NSCLC cell metastasis in vivo. ALKBH5 overexpression decreases the expression and mRNA stability of TGFβR2 and SMAD3 but increases those of SMAD6, while ALKBH5 knockdown causes the opposite results. Importantly, ALKBH5 overexpression or knockdown leads respectively to an attenuated or augmented phosphorylation of SMAD3, an indispensable downstream effector that activates TGF-β/SMAD signaling. Moreover, m6 A-binding proteins YTHDF1/3 promotes TGFβR2 and SMAD3 expression, and YTHDF2 inhibits SMAD6 expression. YTHDF1/2/3 facilitates TGF-β-stimulated EMT and invasion of NSCLC cells. Mechanistically, ALKBH5 affects TGFβR2, SMAD3 and SMAD6 expression and mRNA stability by erasing m6 A modification in NSCLC cells. ALKBH5 weakens YTHDF1/3-mediated TGFβR2 and SMAD3 mRNA stabilization, and abolishes YTHDF2-mediated SMAD6 mRNA degradation, supporting the notion that ALKBH5 inhibits TGF-β-induced EMT and invasion of NSCLC cells via YTHD1/2/3-mediated mechanism. Taken together, our findings highlight an important role of ALKBH5 in regulating TGF-β/SMAD signaling, and establish a mechanistic interaction of ALKBH5 with TGFβR2/SMAD3/SMAD6 for controlling TGF-β-induced EMT in NSCLCs."
https://openalex.org/W4220911389,"The advent of total-body positron emission tomography (PET) has vastly broadened the range of research and clinical applications of this powerful molecular imaging technology1. Such possibilities have accelerated progress in fluorine-18 (18F) radiochemistry with numerous methods available to 18F-label (hetero)arenes and alkanes2. However, access to 18F-difluoromethylated molecules in high molar activity is mostly an unsolved problem, despite the indispensability of the difluoromethyl group for pharmaceutical drug discovery3. Here we report a general solution by introducing carbene chemistry to the field of nuclear imaging with a [18F]difluorocarbene reagent capable of a myriad of 18F-difluoromethylation processes. In contrast to the tens of known difluorocarbene reagents, this 18F-reagent is carefully designed for facile accessibility, high molar activity and versatility. The issue of molar activity is solved using an assay examining the likelihood of isotopic dilution on variation of the electronics of the difluorocarbene precursor. Versatility is demonstrated with multiple [18F]difluorocarbene-based reactions including O–H, S–H and N–H insertions, and cross-couplings that harness the reactivity of ubiquitous functional groups such as (thio)phenols, N-heteroarenes and aryl boronic acids that are easy to install. The impact is illustrated with the labelling of highly complex and functionalized biologically relevant molecules and radiotracers. Carbene chemistry is used to introduce difluoromethyl groups labelled with fluorine-18 into compounds for positron emission tomography imaging, using a reagent designed for high molar activity and versatility."
https://openalex.org/W4221047628,"Sulfation pattern and molecular weight (MW) play a key role in the biological actions of sulfated glycans. Besides anticoagulant effects, certain sulfated glycans can also exhibit anti-SARS-CoV-2 properties. To develop a more selective antiviral carbohydrate, an efficient strategy to separate these two actions is required. In this work, low MW fractions derived from the red alga Botryocladia occidentalis sulfated galactan (BoSG) were generated, structurally characterized, and tested for activity against SARS-CoV-2 and blood coagulation. The lowest MW fraction was found to be primarily composed of octasaccharides of monosulfated monosaccharides. Unlike heparin or native BoSG, we found that hydrolyzed BoSG products had weak anticoagulant activities as seen by aPTT and inhibitory assays using purified cofactors. In contrast, lower MW BoSG-derivatives retained anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity using SARS-CoV-2 spike (S)-protein pseudotyped lentivirus vector in HEK-293T-hACE2 cells monitored by GFP. Surface plasmon resonance confirmed that longer chains are necessary for BoSG to interact with coagulation cofactors but is not required for interactions with certain S-protein variants. We observed distinct affinities of BoSG derivatives for the S-proteins of different SARS-CoV-2 strains, including WT, N501Y (Alpha), K417T/E484K/N501Y (Gamma), and L542R (Delta) mutants, and stronger affinity for the N501Y-containing variants. Docking of the four possible monosulfated BoSG disaccharides in interactions with the N501Y mutant S-protein predicted potential binding poses of the BoSG constructs and favorable binding in close proximity to the 501Y residue. Our results demonstrate that depolymerization and fractionation of BoSG are an effective strategy to segregate its anticoagulant property from its anti-SARS-CoV-2 action."
https://openalex.org/W4220680155,"The oxidation of protein-bound methionines to form methionine sulfoxides has a broad range of biological ramifications, making it important to delineate factors that influence methionine oxidation rates within a given protein. This is especially important for biopharmaceuticals, where oxidation can lead to deactivation and degradation. Previously, neighboring residue effects and solvent accessibility have been shown to impact the susceptibility of methionine residues to oxidation. In this study, we provide proteome-wide evidence that oxidation rates of buried methionine residues are also strongly influenced by the thermodynamic folding stability of proteins. We surveyed the Escherichia coli proteome using several proteomic methodologies and globally measured oxidation rates of methionine residues in the presence and absence of tertiary structure, as well as the folding stabilities of methionine-containing domains. These data indicated that buried methionines have a wide range of protection factors against oxidation that correlate strongly with folding stabilities. Consistent with this, we show that in comparison to E. coli, the proteome of the thermophile Thermus thermophilus is significantly more stable and thus more resistant to methionine oxidation. To demonstrate the utility of this correlation, we used native methionine oxidation rates to survey the folding stabilities of E. coli and T. thermophilus proteomes at various temperatures and propose a model that relates the temperature dependence of the folding stabilities of these two species to their optimal growth temperatures. Overall, these results indicate that oxidation rates of buried methionines from the native state of proteins can be used as a metric of folding stability."
https://openalex.org/W4220724794,"Oxidation of malate to oxaloacetate, catalyzed by either malate dehydrogenase (Mdh) or malate quinone oxidoreductase (Mqo), is a critical step of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Both Mqo and Mdh are found in most bacterial genomes, but the level of functional redundancy between these enzymes remains unclear. A bioinformatic survey revealed that Mqo was not as widespread as Mdh in bacteria but that it was highly conserved in mycobacteria. We therefore used mycobacteria as a model genera to study the functional role(s) of Mqo and its redundancy with Mdh. We deleted mqo from the environmental saprophyte Mycobacterium smegmatis, which lacks Mdh, and found that Mqo was essential for growth on nonfermentable carbon sources. On fermentable carbon sources, the Δmqo mutant exhibited delayed growth and lowered oxygen consumption and secreted malate and fumarate as terminal end products. Furthermore, heterologous expression of Mdh from the pathogenic species Mycobacterium tuberculosis shortened the delayed growth on fermentable carbon sources and restored growth on nonfermentable carbon sources at a reduced growth rate. In M. tuberculosis, CRISPR interference of either mdh or mqo expression resulted in a slower growth rate compared to controls, which was further inhibited when both genes were knocked down simultaneously. These data reveal that exergonic Mqo activity powers mycobacterial growth under nonenergy limiting conditions and that endergonic Mdh activity complements Mqo activity, but at an energetic cost for mycobacterial growth. We propose Mdh is maintained in slow-growing mycobacterial pathogens for use under conditions such as hypoxia that require reductive tricarboxylic acid cycle activity."
https://openalex.org/W4220810487,"The sodium-potassium ATPase (Na/K-ATPase, NKA) establishes ion gradients that facilitate many physiological functions including action potentials and secondary transport processes. NKA comprises a catalytic subunit (alpha) that interacts closely with an essential subunit (beta) and regulatory transmembrane micropeptides called FXYD proteins. In the heart, a key modulatory partner is the FXYD protein phospholemman (PLM, FXYD1), but the stoichiometry of the alpha-beta-PLM regulatory complex is unknown. Here, we used fluorescence lifetime imaging and spectroscopy to investigate the structure, stoichiometry, and affinity of the NKA-regulatory complex. We observed a concentration-dependent binding of the subunits of NKA-PLM regulatory complex, with avid association of the alpha subunit with the essential beta subunit as well as lower affinity alpha-alpha and alpha-PLM interactions. These data provide the first evidence that, in intact live cells, the regulatory complex is composed of two alpha subunits associated with two beta subunits, decorated with two PLM regulatory subunits. Docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations generated a structural model of the complex that is consistent with our experimental observations. We propose that alpha-alpha subunit interactions support conformational coupling of the catalytic subunits, which may enhance NKA turnover rate. These observations provide insight into the pathophysiology of heart failure, wherein low NKA expression may be insufficient to support formation of the complete regulatory complex with the stoichiometry (alpha-beta-PLM)2."
https://openalex.org/W4220823628,"In the last century, the increase in traffic, human activities and industrial production have led to a diffuse presence of air pollution, which causes an increase of risk of several health conditions such as respiratory diseases. In Europe, air pollution is a serious concern that affects several areas, one of the worst ones being northern Italy, and in particular the Po Valley, an area characterized by low air quality due to a combination of high population density, industrial activity, geographical factors and weather conditions. Public health authorities and local administrations are aware of this problem, and periodically intervene with temporary traffic limitations and other regulations, often insufficient to solve the problem. In February 2020, this area was the first in Europe to be severely hit by the SARS-CoV-2 virus causing the COVID-19 disease, to which the Italian government reacted with the establishment of a drastic lockdown. This situation created the condition to study how significant is the impact of car traffic and industrial activity on the pollution in the area, as these factors were strongly reduced during the lockdown. Differently from some areas in the world, a drastic decrease in pollution measured in terms of particulate matter (PM) was not observed in the Po Valley during the lockdown, suggesting that several external factors can play a role in determining the severity of pollution. In this study, we report the case study of the city of Pavia, where data coming from 23 air quality sensors were analyzed to compare the levels measured during the lockdown with the ones coming from the same period in 2019. Our results show that, on a global scale, there was a statistically significant reduction in terms of PM levels taking into account meteorological variables that can influence pollution such as wind, temperature, humidity, rain and solar radiation. Differences can be noticed analyzing daily pollution trends too, as-compared to the study period in 2019-during the study period in 2020 pollution was higher in the morning and lower in the remaining hours."
https://openalex.org/W4220869839,"Elongating nuclear RNA polymerases (Pols) frequently pause, backtrack, and are then reactivated by endonucleolytic cleavage. Pol backtracking and RNA cleavage are also crucial for proofreading, which contributes to transcription fidelity. RNA polymerase I (Pol I) of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae synthesizes exclusively 35S rRNA, the precursor transcript of mature ribosomal 5.8S, 18S, and 25S rRNA. Pol I contains the specific heterodimeric subunits Rpa34.5/49 and subunit Rpa12.2, which have been implicated in RNA cleavage and elongation activity, respectively. These subunits are associated with the Pol I lobe structure and encompass different structural domains, but the contribution of these domains to RNA elongation is unclear. Here, we used Pol I mutants or reconstituted Pol I enzymes to study the effects of these subunits and/or their distinct domains on RNA cleavage, backtracking, and transcription fidelity in defined in vitro systems. Our findings suggest that the presence of the intact C-terminal domain of Rpa12.2 is sufficient to support the cleavage reaction, but that the N-terminal domains of Rpa12.2 and the heterodimer facilitate backtracking and RNA cleavage. Since both N-terminal and C-terminal domains of Rpa12.2 were also required to faithfully incorporate NTPs in the growing RNA chain, efficient backtracking and RNA cleavage might be a prerequisite for transcription fidelity. We propose that RNA Pols containing efficient RNA cleavage activity are able to add and remove nucleotides until the matching nucleotide supports RNA chain elongation, whereas cleavage-deficient enzymes can escape this proofreading process by incorporating incorrect nucleotides."
https://openalex.org/W4220930560,"Canonical NF-κB signaling through the inhibitor of κB kinase (IKK) complex requires induction of IKK2/IKKβ subunit catalytic activity via specific phosphorylation within its activation loop. This process is known to be dependent upon the accessory ubiquitin (Ub)-binding subunit NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO)/IKKγ as well as poly-Ub chains. However, the mechanism through which poly-Ub binding serves to promote IKK catalytic activity is unclear. Here, we show that binding of NEMO/IKKγ to linear poly-Ub promotes a second interaction between NEMO/IKKγ and IKK2/IKKβ, distinct from the well-characterized interaction of the NEMO/IKKγ N terminus to the ""NEMO-binding domain"" at the C terminus of IKK2/IKKβ. We mapped the location of this second interaction to a stretch of roughly six amino acids immediately N-terminal to the zinc finger domain in human NEMO/IKKγ. We also showed that amino acid residues within this region of NEMO/IKKγ are necessary for binding to IKK2/IKKβ through this secondary interaction in vitro and for full activation of IKK2/IKKβ in cultured cells. Furthermore, we identified a docking site for this segment of NEMO/IKKγ on IKK2/IKKβ within its scaffold-dimerization domain proximal to the kinase domain-Ub-like domain. Finally, we showed that a peptide derived from this region of NEMO/IKKγ is capable of interfering specifically with canonical NF-κB signaling in transfected cells. These in vitro biochemical and cell culture-based experiments suggest that, as a consequence of its association with linear poly-Ub, NEMO/IKKγ plays a direct role in priming IKK2/IKKβ for phosphorylation and that this process can be inhibited to specifically disrupt canonical NF-κB signaling."
https://openalex.org/W4225311944,"The actomyosin cytoskeleton serves as a key regulator of the integrity and remodeling of epithelial barriers by controlling assembly and functions of intercellular junctions and cell-matrix adhesions. Although biochemical mechanisms that regulate the activity of non-muscle myosin II (NM-II) in epithelial cells have been extensively investigated, little is known about assembly of the contractile myosin structures at the epithelial adhesion sites. UNC-45A is a cytoskeletal chaperone that is essential for proper folding of NM-II heavy chains and myofilament assembly. We found abundant expression of UNC-45A in human intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) lines and in the epithelial layer of the normal human colon. Interestingly, protein level of UNC-45A was decreased in colonic epithelium of patients with ulcerative colitis. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock-out of UNC-45A in HT-29cf8 and SK-CO15 IEC disrupted epithelial barrier integrity, impaired assembly of epithelial adherence and tight junctions and attenuated cell migration. Consistently, decreased UNC-45 expression increased permeability of the Drosophila gut in vivo. The mechanisms underlying barrier disruptive and anti-migratory effects of UNC-45A depletion involved disorganization of the actomyosin bundles at epithelial junctions and the migrating cell edge. Loss of UNC-45A also decreased contractile forces at apical junctions and matrix adhesions. Expression of deletion mutants revealed roles for the myosin binding domain of UNC-45A in controlling IEC junctions and motility. Our findings uncover a novel mechanism that regulates integrity and restitution of the intestinal epithelial barrier, which may be impaired during mucosal inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W4220875037,"Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are vulnerable to cell death upon dissociation. Thus, dissociation is an obstacle in culturing, maintaining, and differentiating of hESCs. To date, apoptosis has become the focus of research into the nature of cell death triggered by cellular detachment; it remains baffling whether another form of cell death can occur upon dissociation in hESCs. Here, we demonstrate that iron accumulation and subsequently lipid peroxidation are responsible for dissociation-mediated hESC death. Moreover, we found that a decrease of glutathione peroxidase 4 because of iron accumulation promotes ferroptosis. Inhibition of lipid peroxidation (ferrostatin-1) or chelating iron (deferoxamine) largely suppresses iron accumulation-induced ferroptosis in dissociated hESCs. The results show that P53 mediates the dissociation-induced ferroptosis in hESCs, which is suppressed by pifithrin α. Multiple genes involved in ferroptosis are regulated by the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). In this study, solute carrier family 7 member 11 and glutathione peroxidase 4 are involved in GSH synthesis decreased upon dissociation as a target of Nrf2. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that iron accumulation as a consequence of cytoskeleton disruption appears as a pivotal factor in the initiation of ferroptosis in dissociated hESCs. Nrf2 inhibits ferroptosis via its downstream targets. Our study suggests that the antiferroptotic target might be a good candidate for the maintenance of hESCs."

https://openalex.org/W4221036110,"The mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) is a Ca2+-dependent megachannel that plays an important role in mitochondrial physiology and cell fate. Cyclophilin D (CyPD) is a well-characterized PTP regulator, and its binding to the PTP favors pore opening. It has previously been shown that p53 physically interacts with CyPD and opens the PTP during necrosis. Accumulating studies also suggest that the F-ATP synthase contributes to the regulation and formation of the PTP. F-ATP synthase IF1 (mitochondrial ATP synthase inhibitory factor 1) is a natural inhibitor of F-ATP synthase activity; however, whether IF1 participates in the modulation of PTP opening is basically unknown. Here, we demonstrate using calcium retention capacity assay that IF1 overexpression promotes mitochondrial permeability transition via opening of the PTP. Intriguingly, we show that IF1 can interact with the p53-CyPD complex and facilitate cell death. We also demonstrate that the presence of IF1 is necessary for the formation of p53-CyPD complex. Therefore, we suggest that IF1 regulates the PTP via interaction with the p53-CyPD complex, and that IF1 is necessary for the inducing effect of p53-CyPD complex on PTP opening."
https://openalex.org/W4220918302,"The Philippine archipelago was believed to have never been connected to the Asian continent even during the severe Quaternary sea-level drops. As a result, the history of domestic pig (Sus scrofa) dispersal in the Philippines remains controversial and must have some anthropogenic origin associated with human migration events. In this study, the context of origin, dispersal, and the level of genetic introgression in Philippine domestic pigs were deduced using mitochondrial DNA D-loop analysis altogether with domestic pigs and wild boar corresponding to their geographic origin. The results revealed considerable genetic diversity (0.900±0.016) and widespread Asian pig-ancestry (94.60%) in the phylogenetic analysis, with admixed European pig-origin (5.10%) harboring various fractions of ancestry from Berkshire and Landrace. The close genetic connection between the continental wild boars and domestic pigs present in the Philippine domestic pigs corroborates our hypothesis of a genetic signal that may be associated with the recently reported multiple waves of human migrations to the Philippines. The Haplogroup D7, reported to occur only in Indo-Burma Biodiversity Hotspots, included a high frequency of Philippine domestic pig haplotypes (54.08%), which poses an interesting challenge because its distribution is not consistent with the hypothesized migration route of Neolithic Austronesian-speaking populations. We detected the first Pacific Clade signature and ubiquitously distributed D2 haplotypes (Asian major) on several Philippine islands. The analyses of mismatch distribution and neutrality test were consistent with the Bayesian skyline plot which showed a long stationary period of effective population size. The population decline was consistent with the pronounced population bottleneck in Asian and European pigs during the interglacial periods of the Pleistocene. The results of this study will support the conservation strategies and improvements of economically important genetic resources in the Philippines."
https://openalex.org/W4220979457,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) represents a set of idiopathic and chronic inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract. Central to the pathogenesis of IBD is a dysregulation of normal intestinal epithelial homeostasis. cGAS is a DNA-sensing receptor demonstrated to promote autophagy, a mechanism that removes dysfunctional cellular components. Beclin-1 is a crucial protein involved in the initiation of autophagy. We hypothesized that cGAS plays a key role in intestinal homeostasis by upregulating Beclin-1-mediated autophagy. We evaluated intestinal cGAS levels in humans with IBD and in murine colonic tissue after performing a 2% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) colitis model. Autophagy and cell death mechanisms were studied in cGAS KO and WT mice via qPCR, WB analysis, H&E, IF, and TUNEL staining. Autophagy was measured in stimulated intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) via WB analysis. Our data demonstrates cGAS to be upregulated during human and murine colitis. Furthermore, cGAS deficiency leads to worsened colitis and decreased levels of autophagy proteins including Beclin-1 and LC3-II. Co-IP demonstrates a direct binding between cGAS and Beclin-1 in IECs. Transfection of cGAS in stimulated HCT-116 cells leads to increased autophagy. IECs isolated from cGAS KO have diminished autophagic flux. cGAS KO mice subjected to DSS have increased cell death and cleaved caspase-3. Lastly, treatment of cGAS KO mice with rapamycin decreased the severity of colitis. Our data suggest that cGAS maintains intestinal epithelial homeostasis during human IBD and murine colitis by upregulating Beclin-1-mediated autophagy and preventing IEC death. Rescue of autophagy can attenuate the severity of colitis associated with cGAS deficiency."

However, as the previously reported CALHM structures are all in the ATP-conducting state, the gating mechanism of ATP permeation is still elusive.

Structural analysis shows that the heptameric CALHM1s are in an ATP-nonconducting state with a central pore diameter of approximately 6.6 Å. Compared with those inside the octameric CALHM1, the N-helix inside the heptameric CALHM1 is in the “down” position to avoid steric clashing with the adjacent TM1 helix. Molecular dynamics simulations show that as the N-helix moves from the “down” position to the “up” position, the pore size of ATP molecule permeation increases significantly.

These oligomers are usually called hemichannels which release ATP to mediate the subsequent purinergic signal transduction of neighboring cells (4Contreras J.E. Saez J.C. Bukauskas F.F. Bennett M.V.

Hemichannels formed by some isoforms of connexin and CALHM (such as connexin 26, connexin 43, connexin 50, CALHM2, CALHM4, etc.) can dock with each other and further form gap junction channels that allow direct exchange of small metabolites between cells (5Goldberg G.S.

Recent research on the CALHM1–CALHM2 chimera structure suggested that interactions between the long C-terminal helices (LCHs) and the TM4-LCH linker may determine the oligomeric state of the CALHM channels (14Syrjanen J.L. Michalski K. Chou T.H. Grant T. Rao S. Simorowski N. Tucker S.J. Grigorieff N. Furukawa H. Structure and assembly of calcium homeostasis modulator proteins.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2020; 27: 150-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Ren et al. reported a Danio rerio CALHM1 octamer with ordered long C-terminal helices (octamer+LCH) and proposed that the extracellular loop 1 region within the dimer interface may contribute to oligomeric assembly (13Ren Y. Wen T. Xi Z. Li S. Lu J. Zhang X. Yang X. Shen Y. Cryo-EM structure of the calcium homeostasis modulator 1 channel.Sci. Adv. 2020; 6eaba8161Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In this research, we reported cryo-EM reconstructions of two D. rerio CALHM1 heptamers with ordered long C-terminal helices (heptamer+LCH) or flexible long C-terminal helices (heptamer-noLCH) and one D. rerio CALHM1 octamer with flexible long C-terminal helices (octamer-noLCH). The comparison between different CALHM1 oligomers from the same species suggests that the CALHM1 channel may have multiple conformational states. The structures of the drCALHM1 channels were determined by cryo-EM. drCALHM1 channels were purified in the presence or absence of Ca2+ and concentrated for cryo-EM sample preparation. All datasets were collected using a Titan Krios electron microscope operated at 300-kV accelerating voltage with a K2 Summit direct electron-counting detector. Details on the data collection and data processes are shown in Figs. S1–S4. The heptamer+LCH structure was reconstructed from the dataset in the presence of Ca2+. The heptamer-noLCH and octamer-noLCH structures were reconstructed from datasets in the absence of Ca2+. The final 3D reconstructions of heptamer+LCH, heptamer-noLCH, and octamer-noLCH were determined at overall resolutions of 3.2 Å, 2.9 Å, and 3.5 Å, respectively (Figs. S1 and S2). The cryo-EM maps are sufficient to resolve most amino acid side chains (Figs. S3 and S4). Due to the quality of density, the N-helix of heptamer+LCH, heptamer-noLCH, or octamer-noLCH structures only builds an alanine model (Figs. S3 and S4). The overall structure of heptameric drCALHM1 is shaped like a barrel and can be divided into three parts: the extracellular loop, transmembrane domain, and cytoplasmic domain (Fig. 1). From the top view, its extracellular region forms a ring with a diameter of approximately 98 Å, and seven small helices in the middle of the ring can be clearly observed (Fig. 1, A and D). The side view shows that the height of the drCALHM1 heptamer is approximately 92 Å. There are multiple lipid molecules that exist inside a protomer and within the interface of two protomers (Fig. 1, B and E). From the cytosolic view, it can be observed that the cytoplasmic domain mainly consists of one long helix. Seven LCHs intercross each other (Fig. 1, C and F), resulting in a ring diameter of approximately 100 Å. The overall drCALHM1 heptamer is quite similar to that of a previously reported octamer (13Ren Y. Wen T. Xi Z. Li S. Lu J. Zhang X. Yang X. Shen Y. Cryo-EM structure of the calcium homeostasis modulator 1 channel.Sci. Adv. 2020; 6eaba8161Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar) except for the different oligomerization states. As shown in Figure 1, the heptamer has smaller pores than the octamer, and we further calculated the exact pore size with the N-helix having all alanines in the current model (Fig. 2, A and B). The narrowest diameter of the heptamer+LCH channel is approximately 14 Å (Fig. 2C). If the putative side chain was built for the N-helix, the pore diameter was reduced to 6.6 Å, which blocked ATP permeation through the pore but allowed ion flux. To further validate this result, we took advantage of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation methodology. Coarse-grained simulations of heptamer+LCH in the presence of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) lipids were carried out. We added hydrated Na+, hydrated K+, and Cl− ions on either side of the POPC bilayer to the Martini, version 2.0, forcefield (15Monticelli L. Kandasamy S.K. Periole X. Larson R.G. Tieleman D.P. Marrink S.-J. The MARTINI coarse-grained force field: Extension to proteins.J. Chem. Theor. Comput. 2008; 4: 819-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (1693) Google Scholar). Ca2+ ions were added on the extracellular side. During replicates of 10-μs coarse-grained MD simulations, we observed that multiple Na+ cations, K+ cations, and Cl− anions crossed the membrane through the heptamer+LCH channel. In contrast, Ca2+ ions were still on the extracellular side of the POPC bilayer after simulations and were unable to pass through the heptameric channel (Fig. 2D). These simulation results indicated that the heptamer+LCH channel favors the permeation of monovalent ions (Na+, K+, and Cl−) but repulses Ca2+ ions. Moreover, its pore size is too narrow for bulky ATP molecules. We also calculated the electrostatic surface potential distribution of the heptamer+LCH channel and found that the positive potential at the center of the pores of the heptamer is stronger than that of the octamer (Fig. S5), which may be due to the change in the oligomerization state to make the heptameric channel more compact. The strong positive potential distribution inside pores may indicate the voltage-dependent characteristics of ion flux through the CALHM1 channel, as shown by electrophysiological studies (16Tanis J.E. Ma Z. Foskett J.K. The NH2 terminus regulates voltage-dependent gating of CALHM ion channels.Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2017; 313: C173-C186Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). To address the underlying mechanism of the formation of two different oligomers from the same CALHM1 protomer, we first compared the heptamer and octamer by superimposing one protomer of each assembly (Fig. 3A). The entire heptamer forms a smaller circle than the octamer. The protomer is composed of four TMs (TM1, TM2 plus TM2b, TM3 plus TM3b, and TM4), one extracellular helix, and one LCH. The protomers from the heptamer and octamer are extremely similar except for the position of the N-helix. Compared with the N-helix of the octamer, the N-helix of the heptamer moves toward the cytosolic direction by approximately 6 Å (Fig. 3B) (defined as the “down” position in the heptamer and the “up” position in the octamer hereafter). In the heptamer, the N-helix is aligned parallel to and interacts with TM1 (Fig. 3C). The side chain of Leu28 has hydrophobic interactions with Ala10. Moreover, the N-helix from one protomer has multiple interactions with TM1 from the neighboring protomer. One hydrogen bond was formed between the side chain of Gln32 and the main chain carboxyl oxygen atom of Ala9. Additionally, the side chain of Ile25 has hydrophobic interactions with Ala16. We anticipated more interactions between the N-helix and TM1 if the side chain of the N-helix could be built. We then superimposed the dimers from the heptamer and the octamer. These two dimers are similar except for two N-helices (Fig. 3D). Similar to the protomer comparison result, two N-helices in the dimer adapted from the heptamer obviously move down. After superimposing one protomer together, the neighboring protomer from the heptamer occupies a closer position to the pore than that from the octamer (Fig. 3E), resulting in the N-helix from the octamer having a steric clash with TM1 from the heptamer (as shown by the red arrow). Therefore, the N-helix is mandatory in the “down” position in the heptamer. In order to check whether drCALHM1 maintains a functional channel in human cells, we transfected DNA encoding GFP-tagged full-length drCALHM1 into HEK293T cells and conducted electrophysiological studies. A large voltage-dependent outward current was observed using the whole-cell configuration (Fig. S6), indicating that the expression of drCALHM1 in HEK293T cells forms a channel similar to the previously reported Homo sapiens CALHM1 channel (17Ma Z. Siebert A.P. Cheung K.H. Lee R.J. Johnson B. Cohen A.S. Vingtdeux V. Marambaud P. Foskett J.K. Calcium homeostasis modulator 1 (CALHM1) is the pore-forming subunit of an ion channel that mediates extracellular Ca2+ regulation of neuronal excitability.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2012; 109: E1963-E1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), although the oligomeric states of drCALHM1 are unknown. To test the possibility that the movement of the N-helix can be involved in the pore size of CALHM1, we carried out MD simulations. With the help of unbiased supervised MD and biased targeted MD simulations for heptamer+LCH, we accelerated the movement of the N-helix in one protomer of the heptamer from the “down” position to the “up” position on a time scale accessible to MD simulations. During the supervised MD simulations, we monitored the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of the N-helix of protomer 1 (P1) in the current structure compared with that of P1 in the octamer to represent the movement of the N-helix. To monitor the pore size, we calculated the minimum distance of any atom between two N-helices from P1 and P4 protomers (denoted as P1−P4 hereafter), from P2 and P5 protomers (P2−P5), from P3 and P6 protomers (P3−P6), and from P4 and P7 protomers (P4−P7) (Fig. S7A). There was obvious deformation of the 7-fold symmetry structure in the N-helix region caused by the movement of the N-helix in P1 during the supervised MD simulations. Then, we calculated the potential of mean force for the RMSD of the N-helix versus. the P4−P7 distance (Fig. 4A). The potential of mean force map shows the transition process of the heptamer and clearly depicts three different conformational states (state 1, state 2, and state 3) of the heptamer starting from the initial state (state 0) (Fig. 4B). In initial state 0, the RMSD of the N-helix is approximately 6.66 Å, and the P4–P7 distance is approximately 9.57 Å. In states 1, 2, and 3 transformed from state 0, the RMSD of the N-helix is 5.63, 4.80, and 4.70 Å, and the P4−P7 distances are approximately 9.79, 11.89, and 13.26 Å, respectively. The conformational state of the N-helix moves closer to that of P1 in the octamer. Meanwhile, the pore size gradually increased from 9.79 Å to 13.26 Å. Furthermore, the targeted MD also observed that the pore size increased due to the movement of the N-helix (Fig. S7B). Conventional MD simulations were performed as controls, and the position of the N-helix and the pore size of the heptamer remained similar to those in the initial state throughout the simulation time (Fig. S7C). Additionally, we performed conventional MD simulations to show the time-dependent RMSD values for the Cα atoms of the heptamer+LCH or octamer+LCH structures relative to conformations obtained from the cryo-EM structures (Fig. S7, D and E). The RMSDs exhibited small variations during the atomic simulations, implying that the two structures were conformationally stable. Since the heptamer+LCH structure was determined using the dataset in the presence of Ca2+, we tried to understand whether Ca2+ can induce different oligomerization states of drCALHM1. Reprocessing the dataset in the absence of Ca2+, in addition to the previously reported octamer+LCH structure (13Ren Y. Wen T. Xi Z. Li S. Lu J. Zhang X. Yang X. Shen Y. Cryo-EM structure of the calcium homeostasis modulator 1 channel.Sci. Adv. 2020; 6eaba8161Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar), we were able to identify two new conformation states of the drCALHM1 channel, in which the LCH is disordered (Fig. S2). We named them heptamer-noLCH (Fig. 5, A–F) and octamer-noLCH (Fig. 5, G–L). These results suggest that Ca2+ is unlikely to be the cause of the different oligomerization states of the drCALHM1 channel. The overall structures of heptamer-noLCH versus heptamer+LCH and octamer-noLCH versus octamer+LCH are highly similar except for LCHs (Fig. S8, A and B). Moreover, the pore diameters remained similar in these structures with or without LCHs (Fig. S8, C and D), indicating that the LCH did not regulate the pore size. We also compared the buried surface area of the protomer in different conformational states. With the LCH, the buried surface areas are 948.6 Å2 and 959.6 Å2 for the monomer in the heptamer+LCH structure and octamer+LCH structure, respectively. However, without the LCH, the buried surface areas are 627.6 Å2 and 603.3 Å2 for the protomer in the heptamer-noLCH structure and octamer-noLCH structure, respectively. These results suggest that the LCH may serve as a scaffold to stabilize oligomerized CALHM1 channels. In this study, we reported a heptameric drCALHM1 channel with an ATP nonconducting conformation. Compared with the octameric drCALHM1 channel (13Ren Y. Wen T. Xi Z. Li S. Lu J. Zhang X. Yang X. Shen Y. Cryo-EM structure of the calcium homeostasis modulator 1 channel.Sci. Adv. 2020; 6eaba8161Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar), the heptameric drCALHM1 channel undergoes two major changes. One is a much smaller channel ring, leading to a smaller pore and thus possibly blocking ATP permeation. Since the narrowest pore diameter is approximately 6.6 Å, it is likely that the ions can pass through the pores of the heptamer. Indeed, MD results showed that Na+, K+, and Cl− can pass through the pore. However, Ca2+ was precluded from the pore, which may be caused by the positively charged environment inside the pore. Nevertheless, such narrow pores will unlikely allow ATP molecule permeation. The other difference is that the N-helix moves toward the cytosolic direction by approximately 6 Å to avoid the steric clash with neighboring TM1 helices, suggesting that the change in the oligomer state may correlate with the movement of the N-helix. Supervised MD simulations and targeted MD simulations indeed showed that the movement of the N-helix to the “up” position led to the deformation of the 7-fold symmetric structure and significantly increased pore size. We also determined two conformational states of heptameric and octameric drCALHM1 channels with flexible LCHs. Although the current structures of heptamer-noLCH and octamer-noLCH were reconstructed from the Ca2+-free dataset, these two conformational states can be observed from the dataset in the presence of Ca2+. Moreover, it has been noted that the final models of heptamer-noLCH and octamer-noLCH do not include LCHs due to the intrinsic flexibility in these specific conformational states instead of protein degradation. The purified protein sample did not show obvious degraded bands from the SDS-PAGE gel. Therefore, it is reasonable to hypothesize that for the same type of oligomer, the drCALHM1 channel may exhibit equilibrium between two conformational states (ordered versus flexible LCHs). Together with previously published results, we proposed a molecular mechanism of ATP permeation through the CALHM1 channel (Fig. S9). In the resting state, the CALHM1 channel may form a heptamer and equilibrium between ordered LCHs and flexible LCHs. Upon sensing stimulus, the N-helix inside the pore moves up toward the extracellular direction, driving conformational changes and oligomeric rearrangement to facilitate ATP molecule permeation. Compared with the published ATP permeation mechanism of another ATP release channel, pannexin 1 (18Ruan Z. Orozco I.J. Du J. Lu W. Structures of human pannexin 1 reveal ion pathways and mechanism of gating.Nature. 2020; 584: 646-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), our proposed mechanism of ATP permeation has a common point: both use the C-terminal tail to regulate ATP permeation. The major difference is that the C-terminal tail has to be cleaved during ATP permeation in pannexin 1, while the C-terminal part in CALHM1 may switch to the disordered region for further assembly into higher-order oligomers to permeate ATP molecules. To date, several CALHM subtype structures have been reported to form various oligomers (12Demura K. Kusakizako T. Shihoya W. Hiraizumi M. Nomura K. Shimada H. Yamashita K. Nishizawa T. Taruno A.

Consequently, the “protein gate” or “lipid gate” model has been proposed to explain ATP permeation (14Syrjanen J.L. Michalski K. Chou T.H. Grant T. Rao S. Simorowski N. Tucker S.J. Grigorieff N. Furukawa H. Structure and assembly of calcium homeostasis modulator proteins.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2020; 27: 150-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 19Choi W. Clemente N. Sun W. Du J.

Our results are unfavorable for these two models. We did not observe any TM1 movement when compared with the closed and open states of drCALHM1 channels. Additionally, MD simulations did not support the argument that lipids enter the pore. During the 10-μs coarse-grained MD simulations, the lipids assembled into clearly defined upper and lower leaflets around both proteins but could not be accommodated within both channel pores of proteins (Fig. S10). Although the molecular mechanism of ATP permeation in CALHM channels requires further investigation, the feature of dynamic assembly in CALHM channels is certainly quite unique. The correlation between dynamic assembly and biological function remains to be ascertained in the future.

Spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) is a nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinase, which is known to relay adaptive and innate immune signaling, including from TLRs. However, TLRs do not contain the conserved dual immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs that typically recruit Syk to many other receptors. One possibility is that the Syk-TLR association is indirect, relying on an intermediary scaffolding protein. We previously identified a role for the palmitoylated transmembrane adapter protein SCIMP in scaffolding the Src tyrosine kinase Lyn, for TLR phosphorylation, but the role of SCIMP in mediating the interaction between Syk and TLRs has not yet been investigated. Here, we show that SCIMP recruits Syk in response to lipopolysaccharide-mediated TLR4 activation. We also show that Syk contributes to the phosphorylation of SCIMP and TLR4 to enhance their binding. Further evidence pinpoints two specific phosphorylation sites in SCIMP critical for its interaction with Syk-SH2 domains in the absence of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs. Finally, using inhibitors and primary macrophages from SCIMP-/- mice, we confirm a functional role for SCIMP-mediated Syk interaction in modulating TLR4 phosphorylation, signaling, and cytokine outputs. In conclusion, we identify SCIMP as a novel, immune-specific Syk scaffold, which can contribute to inflammation through selective TLR-driven inflammatory responses.

Here, we show that SCIMP recruits Syk in response to lipopolysaccharide-mediated TLR4 activation. We also show that Syk contributes to the phosphorylation of SCIMP and TLR4 to enhance their binding. Further evidence pinpoints two specific phosphorylation sites in SCIMP critical for its interaction with Syk-SH2 domains in the absence of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs. Finally, using inhibitors and primary macrophages from SCIMP-/- mice, we confirm a functional role for SCIMP-mediated Syk interaction in modulating TLR4 phosphorylation, signaling, and cytokine outputs. In conclusion, we identify SCIMP as a novel, immune-specific Syk scaffold, which can contribute to inflammation through selective TLR-driven inflammatory responses. As surveillance and phagocytic cells of the innate immune system, macrophages play a pivotal role in cellular recognition of both invading pathogens and endogenous tissue damage to initiate effective host defense and maintain normal homeostasis. Pathogen and damage signatures are detected mainly through a series of pattern recognition receptors, including prototypical Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which are type I single-pass transmembrane glycoproteins expressed on the plasma membrane or on endosomal membranes (1Gordon S.

TLR4, the archetypal member of the TLR family, is activated by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) which induces phosphorylated TLR4 to engage in homotypic interactions with the intracellular Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domains of the downstream adapters MAL and TRAM to initiate MyD88-dependent and TRIF-dependent TLR signaling, respectively (7Gay N.J.

However, neither TLRs nor these adapters possess intrinsic catalytic activity, therefore these phosphorylation events are mediated by the recruitment of tyrosine kinases (10Chattopadhyay S. Sen G.C.

Naranjo M.J. Tyrosine kinase Syk associates with Toll-like receptor 4 and regulates signaling in human monocytic cells.Immunol. Cell Biol. 2007; 85: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and in the CD14-mediated endocytosis of TLR4 (14Zanoni I. Ostuni R. Marek L.R. Barresi S. Barbalat R. Barton G.M. Granucci F.

However, how Syk is recruited to TLR4 complexes is unresolved. A prototypical Syk recruitment mechanism relies on its SH2 domains binding to immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs, YxxL/Ix6-12YxxL/I) in immunoreceptors such as T-cell receptors, B-cell receptors, and Fc receptors (15Chan A.C.

Syk protein tyrosine kinase regulates Fc receptor gamma-chain-mediated transport to lysosomes.EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4606-4616Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Such receptors signal through ITAMs that are located on either ligand-binding receptor chain itself or associated ITAM-containing transmembrane adapters, such as DAP12 (20Mocsai A. Humphrey M.B. Van Ziffle J.A. Hu Y. Burghardt A. Spusta S.C. Majumdar S. Lanier L.L. Lowell C.A. Nakamura M.C. The immunomodulatory adapter proteins DAP12 and Fc receptor gamma-chain (FcRgamma) regulate development of functional osteoclasts through the Syk tyrosine kinase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6158-6163Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). After ligand stimulation, Src family kinases typically phosphorylate ITAMs on dual tyrosines, which then serve as docking sites for the dual SH2 domains of Syk. The Syk-pITAM association then results in a conformational change of Syk, which disrupts its autoinhibited structure and exposes its kinase domain to activate its enzymatic activity. Activated Syk then leads to downstream propagation of signaling through interaction with a wide variety of substrates and binding partners, including Vav, PLCγ, PI3K, and SLP76/SLP65 (21Deng G.M. Kyttaris V.C. Tsokos G.C. Targeting syk in Autoimmune Rheumatic diseases.Front. Immunol. 2016; 7: 78Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 22Miller Y.I. Choi S.H. Wiesner P. Bae Y.S. The SYK side of TLR4: Signalling mechanisms in response to LPS and minimally oxidized LDL.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2012; 167: 990-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). As a result, it leads to various cellular responses ranging from cytoskeletal reorganization and reactive oxygen species production to cell differentiation, proliferation, and survival (23Mocsai A.

Therefore, binding of two tandem SH2 domains to targeted phosphorylated tyrosine motifs is a critical step in Syk activation for downstream signaling. TLRs do not contain classical tandem ITAM motifs, and while TLR4 contains one tyrosine (human Y786RLL and mouse Y784RLL) in an ITAM-like motif, the potential need for ITAM-containing scaffolds, such as DAP12, to recruit Syk has been proposed (13Chaudhary A. Fresquez T.M. Naranjo M.J. Tyrosine kinase Syk associates with Toll-like receptor 4 and regulates signaling in human monocytic cells.Immunol. Cell Biol. 2007; 85: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 14Zanoni I. Ostuni R. Marek L.R. Barresi S. Barbalat R. Barton G.M. Granucci F. Kagan J.C. CD14 controls the LPS-induced endocytosis of Toll-like receptor 4.Cell. 2011; 147: 868-880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Consideration must be given also to other nonconventional interactions for Syk recruitment. We recently showed that the signaling kinase ERK1/2 bypasses the need for ITAM-mediated recruitment by using the transmembrane adapter, SCIMP, as a scaffold for spatiotemporal recruitment to activated TLR4 (25Lucas R.M. Liu L. Curson J.E.B. Koh Y.W.H. Tuladhar N. Condon N.D. Das Gupta K. Burgener S.S. Schroder K. Ingley E. Sweet M.J. Stow J.L. Luo L. SCIMP is a spatiotemporal transmembrane scaffold for Erk1/2 to direct pro-inflammatory signaling in TLR-activated macrophages.Cell Rep. 2021; 36: 109662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). SCIMP is a TLR adapter belonging to the palmitoylated transmembrane adapter protein (pTRAP) family. It is strongly expressed in myeloid-specific cells, including bone marrow–derived dendritic cells and macrophages (11Luo L. Bokil N.J. Wall A.A. Kapetanovic R. Lansdaal N.M. Marceline F. Burgess B.J. Tong S.J. Guo Z. Alexandrov K. Ross I.L. Hibbs M.L. Stow J.L. Sweet M.J. SCIMP is a transmembrane non-TIR TLR adaptor that promotes proinflammatory cytokine production from macrophages.Nat.

Chem. 2016; 291: 16530-16540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). SCIMP acts as a universal adapter that tailors proinflammatory cytokine secretion in multiple TLR responses mainly by promoting TLR phosphorylation (11Luo L. Bokil N.J. Wall A.A. Kapetanovic R. Lansdaal N.M. Marceline F. Burgess B.J. Tong S.J. Guo Z. Alexandrov K. Ross I.L. Hibbs M.L. Stow J.L. Sweet M.J. SCIMP is a transmembrane non-TIR TLR adaptor that promotes proinflammatory cytokine production from macrophages.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 14133Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 27Luo L. Curson J.E.B. Liu L. Wall A.A. Tuladhar N. Lucas R.M. Sweet M.J. Stow J.L. SCIMP is a universal Toll-like receptor adaptor in macrophages.J. Leukoc. Biol. 2020; 107: 251-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Like other pTRAP members, SCIMP comprises a short leaderless extracellular domain and a transmembrane domain, followed by a larger cytoplasmic tail. The intracellular region contains three tyrosine residues (Y58, Y96, and Y120) and a proline-rich domain (PRD). SCIMP is constitutively associated with the Src homology 3 domain of the Src family kinase, Lyn, through its PRD domain and, following LPS stimulation, SCIMP undergoes rapid Lyn-mediated phosphorylation to induce a unique TIR–non-TIR interaction of SCIMP with TIR domain of TLR4. This association enables Lyn to be a proximal effector for TLR4 phosphorylation, thereby driving a transient signaling response, particularly in the MAPK signaling pathways (11Luo L. Bokil N.J. Wall A.A. Kapetanovic R. Lansdaal N.M. Marceline F. Burgess B.J. Tong S.J. Guo Z. Alexandrov K. Ross I.L. Hibbs M.L. Stow J.L. Sweet M.J. SCIMP is a transmembrane non-TIR TLR adaptor that promotes proinflammatory cytokine production from macrophages.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 14133Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Given that SCIMP functions to scaffold Lyn for TLR phosphorylation and ERK1/2 for signaling, it is also a strong candidate for Syk recruitment to TLRs for inflammatory signaling. In the present study, we examine SCIMP as a potential binding partner for Syk downstream of activated TLR4. Specific tyrosine-binding sites in SCIMP are defined for Syk recruitment and we go on to show a role for SCIMP as a scaffold for Syk-mediated phosphorylation that enhances SCIMP-TLR4 binding and biases downstream inflammatory cytokine programs. Overall, these studies reveal SCIMP as a non-ITAM, immune-specific bridging adapter for Syk recruitment and TLR4 phosphorylation in the control of macrophage inflammatory responses. To interrogate potential interactions of Syk and other regulators with SCIMP in the context of TLR4 complexes, a GST-tagged SCIMP cytoplasmic tail (SCIMP-T1, residues 29–150) was used for pull-downs from LPS-activated macrophage extracts. To minimize nonspecific contaminant proteins from beads, bound proteins were then eluted by PreScission protease cleavage and separated by SDS-PAGE (28Luo L. King N.P. Yeo J.C. Jones A. Stow J.L. Single-step protease cleavage elution for identification of protein-protein interactions from GST pull-down and mass spectrometry.Proteomics. 2014; 14: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Excised bands were identified by LC/MS/MS (Table S1). In addition to some known SCIMP-binding partners including TLR4 (100 kDa), Lyn (50 kDa), ERK1/2 (42/44 kDa), and Grb2 (25 kDa), Syk was also identified at 72 kDa by two independent trypsin-digested peptides, each with over 95% confidence (Fig. 1, A and B). The binding of Syk to SCIMP was then verified by further pull-downs and by immunoprecipitations from cell extracts. Figure 1C shows that the SCIMP cytoplasmic tail was able to bind to Syk, as well as TLR4, Grb2, and Lyn, from LPS-activated macrophage extracts. Grb2 and Lyn are known to bind to phosphorylated Y58 and to the PRD in SCIMP-T1, respectively, but not in the GST control (11Luo L. Bokil N.J. Wall A.A. Kapetanovic R. Lansdaal N.M. Marceline F. Burgess B.J. Tong S.J. Guo Z. Alexandrov K. Ross I.L. Hibbs M.L. Stow J.L. Sweet M.J. SCIMP is a transmembrane non-TIR TLR adaptor that promotes proinflammatory cytokine production from macrophages.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 14133Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To further examine the interaction between Syk and SCIMP in human macrophages, a human macrophage cell line (THP1) overexpressing Myc-tagged SCIMP was stimulated with LPS over a time course. Whole cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an antibody against Myc and then immunoblotted for SCIMP-binding partners. Like Lyn, Syk associated with SCIMP even in the absence of LPS. However, LPS did induce a noticeably stronger binding of SCIMP to activated phospho-Syk (Fig. 1D). This suggests a possible role for phosphorylation in enhancing SCIMP–Syk complex formation. Syk is known to be recruited by an ITAM-containing adapter protein DAP12 (29N'Diaye E.N. Branda C.S. Branda S.S. Nevarez L. Colonna M. Lowell C. Hamerman J.A. Seaman W.E. TREM-2 (triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2) is a phagocytic receptor for bacteria.J. Cell Biol. 2009; 184: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) in some signaling pathways such as downstream of the TREM receptor, thus affecting TLR responses via signaling cross-talk. We examined whether DAP12 functions to bridge Syk to SCIMP. The results showed no interaction between SCIMP and DAP12 (Fig. S1), suggesting that DAP12 is not a component of the SCIMP–Syk complex in TLR pathways. Finally, we examined the localization of Halo-SCIMP and GFP-Syk in cotransfected, LPS-treated RAW264.7 macrophages where GFP-Syk is recruited to cell surface ruffles and colocalizes with surface Halo-SCIMP (Fig. 1, E and F). Taken together, these data show that the tyrosine kinase Syk is a novel binding partner of SCIMP in macrophages. The nature of the interaction between SCIMP and Syk was next examined. The two tandem Src homology 2 (SH2) domains of Syk are each able to bind a motif containing a phosphotyrosine site. Mouse and human SCIMP have three conserved tyrosines, which can be probed using three phosphotyrosine probes to detect selective phosphorylation (30Luo L. Tong S.J. Wall A.A. Khromykh T. Sweet M.J. Stow J.L. Development of SH2 probes and pull-down assays to detect pathogen-induced, site-specific tyrosine phosphorylation of the TLR adaptor SCIMP.Immunol. Cell Biol. 2017; 95: 564-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). RAW264.7 cell extracts were collected over a two-hour time course after ligand stimulation and were used for pull-downs. All three probes captured corresponding phosphorylated tyrosines of SCIMP in response to a range of TLR ligands (TLR2, 3, and 4), indicating different temporal patterns of phosphorylation (Fig. S2, A–C). The quantification of SCIMP phosphorylation at its peak time point showed a significant increase at all three sites (Fig. S2, D–F). Interestingly, SCIMP phosphorylation at each site was dynamic and appeared to oscillate over time. Taken together, SCIMP is rapidly phosphorylated at Y58, Y96, and Y120 in response to multiple TLRs, which suggests these sites could all potentially be important for SCIMP–Syk interaction. To investigate the Syk–SCIMP molecular interaction, we utilized the NH2-terminal SH2 domain (Syk-N-SH2) and COOH-terminal SH2 domain (Syk-C-SH2) of Syk as GST-tagged proteins (Fig. 2A) to pull-down endogenous SCIMP from primary mouse bone marrow–derived macrophages (BMMs) (Fig. 2B). The results from an LPS time course showed that both Syk-N-SH2 and Syk-C-SH2 have TLR4-induced binding to SCIMP, although Syk-N-SH2 is weak and Syk-C-SH2 shows greater SCIMP enrichment. Next, to identify the specific binding sites in SCIMP for the two Syk SH2 domains, CRISPR-mediated SCIMP-deficient RAW264.7 cells were reconstituted with V5-tagged SCIMP-WT or V5-tagged SCIMP-phosphorylation-deficient mutants (SCIMP-Y58F, -Y96F, and -Y120F). We used immunostaining to check that V5-tagged SCIMP-WT is expressed in a comparable fashion and in the same locations as endogenous SCIMP (Fig. S3). Extracts of these reconstituted cells were used for Syk-SH2 pull downs, and CRISPR-mediated SCIMP-deficient RAW264.7 cells were used as a negative control. We found that the binding of Syk-N-SH2 and Syk-C-SH2 to SCIMP was completely abolished in SCIMP phosphorylation-deficient mutants Y96F and Y120F, respectively, whereas the SCIMP Y58F mutation did not affect the association with Syk (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that phosphorylated tyrosine residue Y96 of SCIMP binds Syk-N-SH2, whereas phosphorylated Y120 docks at Syk-C-SH2. In addition, coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) was performed in SCIMP phosphorylation-deficient mutant (Y58F, Y96F, Y120F) cell lines to further verify the SCIMP tyrosine sites for Syk interaction. Consistent with the results from pull-downs, Syk association with SCIMP was significantly reduced in Y96F and Y120F mutants, suggesting both tyrosine sites are required for the recruitment of Syk by SCIMP (Fig. 2D). Taken together, these results indicate that SCIMP is a scaffold for the temporal recruitment of Syk to the membrane and its two specific phosphotyrosine sites (Y96 and Y120) are responsible for binding to the tandem Syk-SH2 domains. The cellular function of both Lyn and Syk in TLR phosphorylation was then examined in macrophages. To firstly investigate the hierarchy of Lyn and Syk activation, RAW264.7 cells were treated with the Lyn inhibitor SU6656 over a 30 min time course, with this causing a significant reduction in Syk phosphorylation (Fig. 3A). This suggests that Syk lies downstream of Lyn in TLR signaling. We then investigated the role of Lyn and Syk in SCIMP and TLR4 phosphorylation. SCIMP-deleted RAW264.7 cells reconstituted with V5-SCIMP-WT were induced by LPS in the presence or absence of Lyn inhibitor (SU6656) or the Syk inhibitor (SykIV). The inhibitor SykIV was used at a concentration of 10 μM after assessing its efficacy and relative specificity with respect to SFKs (Fig. S4). Treatment with either the Lyn or Syk inhibitors attenuated SCIMP phosphorylation, as assessed by immunoprecipitation of V5-SCIMP and phospho-tyrosine blotting (Fig. 3B). This suggests that these two tyrosine kinases both control SCIMP activation. Next, TLR4 phosphorylation was investigated by pull-down assays. GST-TLR4-TIR recombinant proteins were generated as baits and coincubated with LPS-induced macrophage lysates for 30 min. For Syk and Lyn inhibition, each pharmacological inhibitor was added to the medium 1 h prior to LPS stimulation. GST-TLR4-TIR protein was phosphorylated by released intracellular kinases upon LPS stimulation, but the phosphorylation was significantly impaired when cells were treated with Lyn or Syk inhibitors (Fig. 3C). In addition, the recruitment of the SCIMP effector Erk1/2 (25Lucas R.M. Liu L. Curson J.E.B. Koh Y.W.H. Tuladhar N. Condon N.D. Das Gupta K. Burgener S.S. Schroder K. Ingley E. Sweet M.J. Stow J.L. Luo L. SCIMP is a spatiotemporal transmembrane scaffold for Erk1/2 to direct pro-inflammatory signaling in TLR-activated macrophages.Cell Rep. 2021; 36: 109662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar) was not affected by Syk inhibition, suggesting the phosphorylation of SCIMP is not required for Erk1/2 binding (Fig. S5). Taken together, these data support Syk functioning downstream of Lyn for SCIMP and TLR4 phosphorylation. SCIMP-TLR binding is enhanced by phosphorylation, with this modification potentially mediated by Syk and/or Lyn. At first, the interactions between SCIMP and multiple TLRs under basal, unphosphorylated conditions were examined using GST pull-downs with highly purified GST-SCIMP-T1 cytoplasmic domain as a bait on beads to capture different TIR domains in solution. The TIR domains were from purified His-tagged recombinant proteins including TLRs (TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, TLR6) and adapters (MyD88, MAL). The results revealed that TIRs from TLR1, 2, 3, and 4 directly associated with SCIMP-T1, with TLR3-TIR apparently showing particularly strong binding (Fig. S6A). In contrast, no interaction was observed between TLR6-TIR and SCIMP. The lack of binding of MAL or MyD88 TIRs also demonstrates the selectivity of SCIMP–TIR interactions for TLR TIRs and attests to the fidelity of this assay (Fig. S6A). To further characterize TIR-SCIMP binding affinity, we attempted to produce larger quantities of isolated TIRs. However, these TIR domains are notoriously difficult to produce at scale and only the TLR2-TIR was available in sufficient quantities for this analysis. The binding affinity of TLR2-TIR binding to SCIMP was then measured via microscale thermophoresis (MST), and dissociation constants (Kd) of 1.7 μM was detected (Fig. S6B). This confirms the direct interaction of this TLR/SCIMP pair but suggests they form a weak interaction in vitro and in the absence of protein phosphorylation within a micromolar range. Overall, these experiments show that SCIMP has a weak but direct binding to a range of TLR TIR domains under in vitro conditions. In a cellular context, protein–protein interactions are often influenced by posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation. To investigate the binding dynamic between SCIMP and TLRs in cells, co-IPs made use of SCIMP KO RAW264.7 cells stably reconstituted with V5-tagged WT SCIMP (V5-SCIMP-WT). Cells were stimulated with the TLR2 agonist zymosan or TLR2/6 agonist FSL-1, and immunoprecipitations were performed on cell lysates using the V5 antibody. Binding of V5-SCIMP-WT with TLR2 was detected in reconstituted RAW264.7 cells upon ligand activation of the receptor (Fig. S7, A and B), in keeping with our previous finding (27Luo L. Curson J.E.B. Liu L. Wall A.A. Tuladhar N. Lucas R.M. Sweet M.J. Stow J.L. SCIMP is a universal Toll-like receptor adaptor in macrophages.J. Leukoc. Biol. 2020; 107: 251-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). SCIMP-TLR interactions were also tested in primary BMMs treated with the TLR2 ligand Pam3CSK4 or the TLR4 ligand LPS. Activated TLR2 and TLR4 were each coimmunoprecipitated with SCIMP and these interactions peaked at 10 min, coinciding with ligand-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of SCIMP, detected with a phosphotyrosine antibody (Fig. 4, A and B). The constitutive binding of Lyn to SCIMP (Fig. 1D and (11Luo L. Bokil N.J. Wall A.A. Kapetanovic R. Lansdaal N.M. Marceline F. Burgess B.J. Tong S.J. Guo Z. Alexandrov K. Ross I.L. Hibbs M.L.

Commun. 2017; 8: 14133Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar)) is not affected by SCIMP phosphorylation (Fig. 4, A and B). Therefore, SCIMP phosphorylation correlates with its binding to TLRs. SCIMP phosphorylation sites were further examined using the specific phospho-probes introduced in Fig. S2. Pull-downs in BMMs made use of the three effector binding domain probes (Grb2, Csk, and SLP65) to capture SCIMP phosphorylated at Y58, Y96, and Y120. The Grb2 and Csk probes show convincing LPS-induced phosphorylation of SCIMP at Y58 and Y96. There is only mild induction of phospho-Y120 detected in BMMs using the SLP65 probe (Fig. 4C). Collectively, these results provide evidence for binding of SCIMP to TLR TIRs that is enhanced in cells when SCIMP is phosphorylated at all three sites. We also examined a requirement for Syk or Lyn kinase activity to enhance SCIMP–TLR4 interactions. GST-SCIMP-T1 pulls down TLR4 from LPS-activated macrophage lysates, but this interaction was reduced in the presence of either Lyn or Syk inhibitors compared to untreated controls (Fig. 5A). Similarly, co-IP of TLR4 with V5-SCIMP showed peak binding"

Hh overexpression causes OA-like cartilage lesions, whereas its downregulation prevents articular destruction in mouse models. Mutations in EVC and EVC2 genes disrupt Hh signaling, and are responsible for the Ellis-van Creveld syndrome skeletal dysplasia. Since Ellis-van Creveld syndrome protein (Evc) deletion is expected to hamper Hh target gene expression we hypothesized that it would also prevent OA progression avoiding chondrocyte hypertrophy. Our aim was to study Evc as a new therapeutic target in OA, and whether Evc deletion restrains chondrocyte hypertrophy and prevents joint damage in an Evc tamoxifen induced knockout (EvccKO ) model of OA. For this purpose, OA was induced by surgical knee destabilization in wild-type (WT) and EvccKO adult mice, and healthy WT mice were used as controls (n = 10 knees/group). Hypertrophic markers and Hh genes were measured by qRT-PCR, and metalloproteinases (MMP) levels assessed by western blot. Human OA chondrocytes and cartilage samples were obtained from patients undergoing knee joint replacement surgery. Cyclopamine (CPA) was used for Hh pharmacological inhibition and IL-1 beta as an inflammatory insult. Our results showed that tamoxifen induced inactivation of Evc inhibited Hh overexpression and partially prevented chondrocyte hypertrophy during OA, although it did not ameliorate cartilage damage in DMM-EvccKO mice. Hh pathway inhibition did not modify the expression of proinflammatory mediators induced by IL-1 beta in human OA chondrocytes in culture. We found that hypertrophic-IHH-and inflammatory-COX-2-markers co-localized in OA cartilage samples. We concluded that tamoxifen induced inactivation of Evc partially prevented chondrocyte hypertrophy in DMM-EvccKO mice, but it did not ameliorate cartilage damage. Overall, our results suggest that chondrocyte hypertrophy per se is not a pathogenic event in the progression of OA."

High-fiber diets consisting of oligofructose alone (HFS/O) or in combination with β-glucan (HFS/OB), resistant starch (HFS/OR), or β-glucan and resistant starch (HFS/OBR) were fed to diet-induced obese rats for 8 weeks to determine if these fibers could attenuate the obese phenotype. Only the HFS/O group displayed a decrease in body weight and body fat, but all fiber interventions improved insulin sensitivity and cognitive function. The HFS/O diet was the least effective at improving cognitive function and only the HFS/OB group showed improvements in glucose tolerance, thus highlighting the differential effects of fiber types. Hippocampal cytokines (IL-6, IL-10) were more pronounced in the HFS/OB group which coincided with the most time spend in the open arms of the elevated plus maze. All fiber groups showed an increase in beneficial Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus abundance while the HFS group showed higher abundance of Clostridium. Fecal microbiota transplant from fiber-treated rats into germ-free mice did not alter body composition in the mice but did result in a higher abundance of Bacteroides in the HFS/O and HFS/OB groups compared to HFS. The HFS/OB recipient mice also had higher insulin sensitivity compared to the other groups. This study highlights the influence of dietary fiber type on metabolic and cognitive outcomes suggesting that the type of supplementation (single or combined fibers) could be tailored to specific targeted outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W4226317301,"The vagus nerve can, via the alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR), regulate inflammation. The gene coding for the α7nAChR, CHRNA7, can be partially duplicated, that is, CHRFAM7A, which is reported to impair the anti-inflammatory effect mediated via the α7nAChR. Several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been described in both CHRNA7 and CHRFAM7A, however, the functional role of these SNPs for immune responses remains to be investigated. In the current study, we set out to investigate whether genetic variants of CHRNA7 and CHRFAM7A can influence immune responses. By investigating data available from the Swedish SciLifeLab SCAPIS Wellness Profiling (S3WP) study, in combination with droplet digital PCR and freshly isolated PBMCs from the S3WP participants, challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), we show that CHRNA7 and CHRFAM7A are expressed in human PBMCs, with approximately four times higher expression of CHRFAM7A compared with CHRNA7. One SNP in CHRFAM7A, rs34007223, is positively associated with hsCRP in healthy individuals. Furthermore, gene ontology (GO)-terms analysis of plasma proteins associated with gene expression of CHRNA7 and CHRFAM7A demonstrated an involvement for these genes in immune responses. This was further supported by in vitro data showing that several SNPs in both CHRNA7 and CHRFAM7A are significantly associated with cytokine response. In conclusion, genetic variants of CHRNA7 and CHRFAM7A alters cytokine responses. Furthermore, given that CHRFAM7A SNP rs34007223 is associated with inflammatory marker hsCRP in healthy individuals suggests that CHRFAM7A may have a more pronounced role in regulating inflammatory processes in humans than previously been recognized."
https://openalex.org/W4220663497,"The clearance of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles from the circulation is regulated by the LDL receptor (LDLR) and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK9) interaction. Its disruption reduces blood cholesterol levels and delays atherosclerosis progression. Whether other members of the LDLR superfamily are in vivo targets of PCSK9 has been poorly explored. The aim of this work was to study the interaction between PCSK9 and members of the LDLR superfamily in the regulation of liver cholesterol homeostasis in an in vivo low-density lipoprotein receptor related protein 5 (LRP5) deficient mice model challenged with high-fat diet. Our results show that Wt and Lrp5-/- mice fed a hypercholesterolemic diet (HC) have increased cholesterol ester accumulation and decreased liver LDLR and LRP5 gene and protein expression. Very low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR), LRP6, LRP2, and LRP1 expression levels were analyzed in liver samples and show that they do not participate in Lrp5-/- liver cholesterol uptake. Immunoprecipitation experiments show that LRP5 forms a complex with PCSK9 in liver-specific fat-storing stellate cells but not in structural HepG2 cells. Hepatic stellate cells silenced for LRP5 and/or PCSK9 expression and challenged with lipids show reduced cholesterol ester accumulation, indicating that both proteins are involved in lipid processing in the liver. Our results indicate that cholesterol esters accumulate in livers of Wt mice in a LDLR-family-members dependent manner as VLDLR, LRP2, and LRP6 show increased expression in HC mice. However, this increase is lost in livers of Lrp5-/- mice, where scavenger receptors are involved in cholesterol uptake. PCSK9 expression is strongly downregulated in mice livers after HC feeding. However PCSK9 and LRP5 bind in the cytoplasm of fat storing liver cells, indicating that this PCSK9-LRP5 interaction is cell-type specific and that both proteins contribute to lipid uptake."
https://openalex.org/W4220759411,"The spleen is an important immune organ in fish. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to play an important role in the regulation of immune function. However, miRNA expression profiles and their interaction networks associated with the postnatal late development of spleen tissue are still poorly understood in fish. The grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) is an important economic aquaculture species in China. Here, two small RNA libraries were constructed from the spleen tissue of healthy grass carp at one-year-old and three-year-old. A total of 324 known conserved miRNAs and 9 novel miRNAs were identified by using bioinformatic analysis. Family analysis showed that 23 families such as let-7, mir-1, mir-10, mir-124, mir-8, mir-7, mir-9, and mir-153 were highly conserved between vertebrates and invertebrates. In addition, 14 families such as mir-459, mir-430, mir-462, mir-7147, mir-2187, and mir-722 were present only in fish. Expression analysis showed that the expression patterns of miRNAs in the spleen of one-year-old and three-year-old grass carp were highly consistent, and the percentage of miRNAs with TPM > 100 was above 39%. Twenty significant differentially expressed (SDE) miRNAs were identified. Gene ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis showed that these SDE miRNAs were primarily involved in erythrocyte differentiation, lymphoid organ development, immune response, lipid metabolic process, the B cell receptor signaling pathway, the T cell receptor signaling pathway, and the PPAR signaling pathway. In addition, the following miRNA-mRNA interaction networks were constructed: immune and hematopoietic, cell proliferation and differentiation, and lipid metabolism. This study determined the miRNA transcriptome as well as miRNA-mRNA interaction networks in normal spleen tissue during the late development stages of grass carp. The results expand the number of known miRNAs in grass carp and are a valuable resource for better understanding the molecular biology of the spleen development in grass carp."

In RHA1, the catabolism of two classes of lignin-derived compounds, alkylphenols and alkylguaiacols, involves a phylogenetically distinct extradiol dioxygenase, AphC, previously misannotated as BphC, an enzyme involved in biphenyl catabolism. To better understand the role of AphC in RHA1 catabolism, we first showed that purified AphC had highest apparent specificity for 4-propylcatechol (kcat/KM ∼106 M−1 s−1), and its apparent specificity for 4-alkylated substrates followed the trend for alkylguaiacols: propyl > ethyl > methyl > phenyl > unsubstituted. We also show AphC only poorly cleaved 3-phenylcatechol, the preferred substrate of BphC. Moreover, AphC and BphC cleaved 3-phenylcatechol and 4-phenylcatechol with different regiospecificities, likely due to the substrates’ binding mode. A crystallographic structure of the AphC·4-ethylcatechol binary complex to 1.59 Å resolution revealed that the catechol is bound to the active site iron in a bidentate manner and that the substrate’s alkyl side chain is accommodated by a hydrophobic pocket. Finally, we show RHA1 grows on a mixture of 4-ethylguaiacol and guaiacol, simultaneously catabolizing these substrates through meta-cleavage and ortho-cleavage pathways, respectively, suggesting that the specificity of AphC helps to prevent the routing of catechol through the Aph pathway. Overall, this study contributes to our understanding of the bacterial catabolism of aromatic compounds derived from lignin, and the determinants of specificity in extradiol dioxygenases.

Overall, this study contributes to our understanding of the bacterial catabolism of aromatic compounds derived from lignin, and the determinants of specificity in extradiol dioxygenases. The bacterial catabolism of aromatic compounds has long been studied for its potential in the bioremediation of pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and, more recently, the valorization of lignocellulosic biomass, a critical feedstock for a bio-based economy. Studies in phylogenetically diverse bacteria that aerobically catabolize aromatic compounds, such as Pseudomonas and Rhodococcus, have revealed that the relevant pathways are organized in a modular, convergent fashion (1Yam K.C. Geize R.V.D. Eltis L.D. Catabolism of aromatic compounds and steroids by Rhodococcus.in: Biology of Rhodococcus. Springer, Berlin/Heidelberg, Germany2010: 133-169Crossref Google Scholar). More specifically, growth substrates are initially transformed via upper pathways to a limited number of shared intermediates (2Patrauchan M.A. Florizone C. Dosanjh M. Mohn W.W. Davies J. Eltis L.D. Catabolism of benzoate and phthalate in Rhodococcus sp. strain RHA1: Redundancies and convergence.J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 4050-4063Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The latter, typically catechols including protocatechuate, are then transformed to central metabolites via lower pathways (2Patrauchan M.A. Florizone C. Dosanjh M. Mohn W.W. Davies J. Eltis L.D. Catabolism of benzoate and phthalate in Rhodococcus sp. strain RHA1: Redundancies and convergence.J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 4050-4063Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The catecholic intermediates are subject to either meta-cleavage or ortho-cleavage, catalyzed by extradiol and intradiol dioxygenases, respectively. The convergent nature of bacterial aromatic catabolism provides an attractive approach for converting lignin depolymerization products, which typically occur as mixtures, to useful chemicals via biological funneling (3Becker J.

However, important aspects of aromatic catabolism have yet to be elucidated to realize this biocatalytic potential.Rhodococcus jostii RHA1 is a model organism for a variety of physiological processes including the catabolism of aromatic compounds and steroids, the latter of which are also catabolized via a catecholic intermediate (5McLeod M.P.

In bacteria such as RHA1, PCBs are cometabolized by the four-enzyme Bph pathway, which catabolizes biphenyl to benzoate and 2-hydroxypenta-2,4-dienoate (9Furukawa K. Biochemical and genetic bases of microbial degradation of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).J. Gen. Appl. Microbiol. 2000; 46: 283-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The potent PCB-degrading activity of RHA1 is due in part to its harboring multiple homologs of the Bph enzymes (8Seto M. Masai E. Ida M. Hatta T. Kimbara K. Fukuda M. Yano K.

BphC (EC 1.13.11.39) is the third enzyme of the Bph pathway, an extradiol dioxygenase that catalyzes the 2,3-cleavage of 3-phenylcatechol (also named 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl) to 2-hydroxy-6-oxo-6-phenylhexa-2,4-dienoate (6-phenyl HODA), a meta-cleavage product (MCP). Although RHA1 contains 13 extradiol dioxygenases (11Goncalves E.R. Hara H. Miyazawa D. Davies J.E. Eltis L.D. Mohn W.W.

RCF has taken on new importance as the basis of a sustainable biorefining strategy to convert biomass (15Liao Y. Koelewijn S.F. Van den Bossche G. Van Aelst J. Van den Bosch S. Renders T. Navare K.

In this context, alkylphenol and alkylguaiacol catabolism are of interest to the development of microbial cell factories to valorize RCF lignin. In RHA1, alkylphenols are hydroxylated by AphAB, a two-component flavin-dependent monooxygenase, while alkylguaiacols are O-demethylated by AgcAB, a cytochrome P450 system (13Fetherolf M.M.

In both cases, the products are 4-alkylcatechols, which are subject to meta-cleavage by AphC (Fig. 1), an extradiol dioxygenase that had initially been identified as BphC (10Sakai M. Masai E.

AphC and BphC, of which the best characterized homolog is BphCLB400 from Paraburkholderia xenovorans LB400, are type I extradiol dioxygenases belonging to the VOC superfamily and utilize Fe2+ coordinated by a 2-His 1-carboxylate facial triad to catalyze catechol cleavage (16Vaillancourt F.H. Bolin J.T. Eltis L.D. The ins and outs of ring-cleaving dioxygenases.Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2006; 41: 241-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Although RHA1 catabolizes 4-alkylcatechols via a meta-cleavage pathway and catechol via an ortho-cleavage pathway (13Fetherolf M.M. Levy-Booth D.J. Navas L.E. Liu J. Grigg J.C. Wilson A. Katahira R.

A. 2020; 117: 25771-25778Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), it is unknown whether RHA1 utilizes the two pathways simultaneously. Indeed, the misrouting of catechols down the wrong pathway may be metabolically inefficient. For example, the ortho-cleavage of 4-methylcatechol leads to the formation of 4-methylmuconolactone, a dead-end metabolite in some bacteria (17Catelani D. Fiecchi A. Galli E. Dextro-gamma-carboxymethyl-gamma-methyl-delta-alpha-butenolide. A 1,2-ring-fission product of 4-methylcatechol by Pseudomonas desmolyticum.Biochem. J. 1971; 121: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).Herein, we studied AphC from RHA1 with the objectives of understanding the molecular basis of its activity and its contribution to the metabolism of aromatic compounds by RHA1. We evaluated the enzyme’s specificity (kcat/KM) for 4-substituted catechols and other substrates. To obtain insight into this specificity, we determined a crystal structure of AphC in complex with 4-ethylcatechol (4EC). Further insight was obtained by comparing the regiospecificities of AphC and BphCLB400 for 3-phenylcatechol and 4-phenylcatechol. Finally, we studied the ability of RHA1 to grow on a mixture of 4-ethylguaiacol and guaiacol, catabolized by meta-cleavage and ortho-cleavage pathways, respectively. Overall, the results provide insights into the molecular basis of specificity in extradiol dioxygenases and contribute to our understanding of the bacterial catabolism of aromatic compounds.ResultsPhylogenetic analysisTo better understand the relationship between AphC and its orthologs, we aligned the amino acid sequences of representative type I extradiol dioxygenases and analyzed their phylogeny. Conserved residues include His155, His217, and Glu268 (AphC numbering) that ligate the catalytically essential metal ion, as well as His200, His249, and Tyr258. In homologous enzymes, His249 and Tyr258 are proposed to deprotonate one of the hydroxyls of the Fe2+-bound catechol, and His200 is proposed to protonate an Fe2+-bound alkylperoxo intermediate (16Vaillancourt F.H.

The phylogenetic analysis (Fig. S1) revealed that AphC is most similar to PheC (49% amino acid sequence identity), an uncharacterized catechol 2,3-dioxygenase that occurs in Chloroflexi, an ancient phylum of bacteria. By contrast, AphC shares 25% amino acid sequence identity with XylE, a prototypical catechol 2,3-dioxygenase, and just over 15% identity with BphCLB400, a prototypical BphC-type enzyme. The phylogenetic relationship of AphC to PheC, together with the enzyme’s involvement in catabolizing 4-alkylcatechols (13Fetherolf M.M. Levy-Booth D.J. Navas L.E. Liu J. Grigg J.C. Wilson A.

A. 2020; 117: 25771-25778Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) prompted us to characterize the enzyme further.Preparation of AphCTo further characterize AphC, we heterologously produced the enzyme as a His-tagged protein in Escherichia coli. We purified AphC to >95% apparent homogeneity (Fig. S2) using immobilized metal affinity chromatography and proteolytically removed the affinity tag. This yielded ∼20 mg of purified AphC per liter of cell culture. Anaerobic reconstitution with Fe2+ followed by gel filtration yielded preparations of AphC containing ∼2 equivalents of iron. Nonreconstituted preparations contained similar amounts of iron, suggesting adventitious binding. In subsequent studies, the concentration of AphC was based on the concentration of protein determined by the BCA method.The catechol-cleaving activities of AphCTo assess the substrate preference of AphC, we measured the activity of the enzyme using a range of catechols and an oxygraph assay (Table 1). Although AphC catalyzed the cleavage of a variety of catechols, two trends were apparent; it had significantly higher specific activities for alkylcatechols versus halocatechols, and it had higher activities for 4-substituted catechols than 3-substituted ones. This was perhaps most striking for the phenylcatechols. Indeed, AphC did not detectably consume O2 in the presence of 3-phenylcatechol despite the enzyme having been previously annotated as BphC (10Sakai M. Masai E. Asami H. Sugiyama K. Kimbara K.

To further assess the ability of AphC to cleave 3-phenylcatechol, we used a spectrophotometric assay to monitor the formation of the MCP at 428 nm. While some formation of an MCP was detected, the absorbance decayed rapidly (Fig. S3), complicating further studies. This is in contrast to 6-phenyl HODA, the MCP generated by the BphCLB400-catalyzed cleavage of 3-phenylcatechol, which has a half-life of ∼58 h under similar conditions (19Seah S.Y. Labbe G.

Finally, based on monitoring phenylcatechol depletion using HPLC, we estimated that the specific activity of AphC for 4-phenylcatechol is 30 × higher than for 3-phenylcatechol.Table 1Specific activity of AphC with different catecholsaThe activity of AphC was measured using an oxygraph and 200 μM of each catechol (air-saturated Hepes (I = 0.1 M), pH 8, 25 °C) except for 3-phenylcatechol, for which specific activity was determined by monitoring substrate depletion using HPLC.

Open table in a new tab To better characterize the MCPs resulting from the AphC-catalyzed cleavage of phenylcatechols, we compared them with those generated using BphCLB400. Incubation of 3-phenylcatechol and 4-phenylcatechol with each of the two enzymes yielded species with m/z values of 217.05 (Fig. S4), consistent with them all being phenyl HODAs. However, the four MCPs had different retention times (tR) on the HPLC column, suggesting that each arose from a different mode of cleavage. More specifically, the BphCLB400-catalyzed cleavage of 3-phenylcatechol (tR = 8.6 min) yields 6-phenyl HODA (21Catelani D. Colombi A. Sorlini C. Treccani V. Metabolism of biphenyl. 2-Hydroxy-6-oxo-6-phenylhexa-2,4-dienoate: The meta-cleavage product from 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl by Pseudomonas putida.Biochem. J. 1973; 134: 1063-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and the cleavage of 4-phenylcatechol (tR = 8.1 min) is deduced to be 4-phenyl HODA. As noted above, the AphC-catalyzed cleavage of 4-phenylcatechol (tR = 7.4 min) yields 5-phenyl HODA. The MCP resulting from the AphC-catalyzed cleavage of 3-phenylcatechol (tR = 6.4 min) was obtained in too low yield and was too labile (Fig. S3) for NMR analysis. However, it is deduced to be 3-phenyl HODA. The structures of the four phenyl HODA products are shown in Fig. S5.Substrate specificityTo establish AphC’s substrate specificity (kcat/KM) for select catechols, we used a spectrophotometric assay with the wavelengths and extinction coefficients listed in Table S1. In all cases, the dependence of the initial reaction rate on substrate concentration obeyed Michaelis–Menten kinetics (Fig. S6). As summarized in Table 2, AphC exhibited the highest apparent specificity for 4-propylcatechol (20 mM Hepes, I = 0.1 M, pH 8 at 25 °C) and cleaved 4-alkylcatechols in the following order of apparent specificity: propyl > ethyl > methyl > phenyl > no substituent. This is consistent with the trend determined apparent specificity of AgcAB for alkylguaiacols (13Fetherolf M.M. Levy-Booth D.J. Navas L.E. Liu J. Grigg J.C. Wilson A. Katahira R. Beckham G.T.

AphC also displayed Michaelis–Menten behavior with respect to O2 concentration in the presence of saturating amounts of 4-propylcatechol (Fig. S6). Under these conditions, the enzyme’s KM O2 value was 70 ± 10 μM.Table 2Steady-state kinetic parameters of AphCaExperiments were performed using air-saturated Hepes (I = 0.1 M), pH 8, at 25 °C and the spectrophotometric assay unless otherwise noted.

Open table in a new tab The crystallographic structure of AphCThe crystal structure of AphC in complex with the substrate 4EC was solved by molecular replacement using the previously deposited crystal structure of AphC from a different crystal form, prepared aerobically and missing the last 30 amino acids (PBD ID 3LM4, (22Syed Ibrahim B. Kumaran D. Burley S.K. Swaminathan S. New York SGX Research Center for Structural Genomics (NYSGXRC)Crystal structure of 2,3-Dihydroxy biphenyl dioxygenase from Rhodococcus sp. (strain RHA1).PDB. 2010; https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb3lm4/pdbCrossref Google Scholar)). There is no accompanying publication for this structure yet, and it is annotated as a catechol 2,3-dioxygenase, like BphC. In our anaerobic structure, 4EC is bound to the tetrameric AphC enzyme (Figs. 2A and S7). The iron is coordinated by His155, His217, and Glu268, consistent with the 2-His 1-carboxylate facial triad in homologous structures. In the complex, iron is six-coordinate in a distorted square bipyramidal geometry: the two oxygens from bidentate-bound 4EC and the Nε2 atoms of His155 and His217 are in the plane, while the Glu268 carboxylate and a water molecule occupy the axial positions (Fig. 2B). The 4EC hydroxyl-iron bond lengths are consistent in all protomers, with average distances of Fe-O1 ∼1.9 Å and Fe-O2 ∼2.2 Å. During catalysis, 4EC O2 is deprotonated, which is expected to shorten the Fe-O bond length. Indeed, several other published extradiol enzyme structures have an equivalent Fe-O2 bond length approximately 0.4 Å shorter than Fe-O1, consistent with this deprotonation. In BphCLB400·3-phenylcatechol, the equivalent Fe-O1 and Fe-O2 bond lengths are 2.4 Å and 2.0 Å, respectively (23Vaillancourt F.H. Barbosa C.J. Spiro T.G. Bolin J.T. Blades M.W. Turner R.F. Eltis L.D. Definitive evidence for monoanionic binding of 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl to 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl 1,2-dioxygenase from UV resonance Raman spectroscopy, UV/Vis absorption spectroscopy, and crystallography.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 2485-2496Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). It is unclear why this is not the case in the AphC·4EC structure, but for this reason, 4EC was refined in its fully protonated form. His249 and Tyr258 are the conserved catalytic residues responsible for catechol deprotonation in homologous enzymes. In the structure, Tyr258 forms a hydrogen bond with the 4EC O2 hydroxyl group and His249 forms a stacking interaction with the catechol ring as well as a hydrogen bond with Tyr258. The other conserved catalytic residue, His200 (His195 in BphCLB400), forms a hydrogen bond with the iron coordinating water molecule. In the proposed mechanism, molecular oxygen replaces the water molecule at this site, and His200 protonates the alkylperoxo intermediate within the catalytic reaction (18Fielding A.J. Lipscomb J.D.

The 4-ethyl moiety from 4EC binds in a hydrophobic space defined by residues Trp192, Met205, Ile251, Leu296, Leu303, and Phe309, which can also accommodate larger side chains such as propyl and even phenyl groups (Figs. 2, B and C, 3).Figure 2Structure of AphC active site and comparison of substrate-binding pocket with BphC and DoxG.

The extracellular palm domain serves as a key link to the channel pore. In this study, we used cysteine-scanning mutagenesis to assess the functional effects of Cys-modifying reagents on palm domain β10 strand residues in mouse ENaC. Of the 13 ENaC α subunit mutants with Cys substitutions examined, only mutants at sites in the proximal region of β10 exhibited changes in channel activity in response to methanethiosulfonate reagents. Additionally, Cys substitutions at three proximal sites of β and γ subunit β10 strands also rendered mutant channels methanethiosulfonate-responsive. Moreover, multiple Cys mutants were activated by low concentrations of thiophilic Cd2+. Using the Na+ self-inhibition response to assess ENaC gating behavior, we identified four α, two β, and two γ subunit β10 strand mutations that changed the Na+ self-inhibition response. Our results suggest that the proximal regions of β10 strands in all three subunits are accessible to small aqueous compounds and Cd2+ and have a role in modulating ENaC gating. These results are consistent with a structural model of mouse ENaC that predicts the presence of aqueous tunnels adjacent to the proximal part of β10 and with previously resolved structures of a related family member where palm domain structural transitions were observed with channels in an open or closed state."

Methods Patients who underwent silicone intubation for incomplete PANDO and had undergone facial computed tomography (CT) were included. Surgical success was judged by both epiphora improvement and normalized tear meniscus height (TMH; &lt; 300 μm) on anterior segment optical coherence tomography at 3 months after tube removal. The area, major axis diameter, and minor axis diameter of the elliptic bony NLD sections were measured in 1.0 mm-thick axial CT images. These bony NLD sizes were analyzed for associations with surgical success and TMH normalization. Results Eighty-one eyes of 48 patients were investigated. The smallest area and the smallest minor axis diameter were significantly larger in the success group (49 eyes), compared with those in the failure group (median smallest minor axis diameter: 4.7 mm vs. 3.8 mm, P = 0.008, Mann–Whitney U test). There was also a tendency for the TMH normalization rate to significantly increase as the smallest area and the smallest minor axis diameter increased (P = 0.028 and 0.037, respectively, Fisher’s 2 × 4 tests). Under multivariable logistic regression analysis using generalized estimating equation, a larger smallest minor axis diameter was associated with success of the nasolacrimal silicone intubation (odds ratio: 2.481, 95% confidence interval: 1.143–5.384). Conclusion Surgical success of the nasolacrimal silicone intubation in incomplete PANDO is associated with a larger smallest minor axis diameter of the bony NLD. This finding will help understand the pathophysiology of surgical failure after nasolacrimal silicone intubation."
https://openalex.org/W4220691877,"Background Minimally invasive surgery is commonly used to treat patients with colorectal cancer, although it can cause surgical site infections (SSIs) that can affect the oncologic outcome. Use of a gentamicin-collagen sponge may help reduce the occurrence of SSIs. We aimed to determine the effectiveness of a gentamicin-collagen sponge in reducing SSIs in minimally invasive surgery for colorectal cancer. Methods We retrospectively reviewed the records of 310 patients who were diagnosed with colorectal cancer at our hospital and underwent minimally invasive surgery between December 1, 2018, and February 28, 2021. Propensity score matching was conducted with a 1:1 ratio using logistic regression. The primary outcome was the incidence of SSIs in the mini-laparotomy wound. The secondary endpoints were factors affecting the incidence of SSIs. Results After propensity score matching, 130 patients were assigned to each group. There were no differences in clinical characteristics between the two groups. SSIs occurred in 2 (1.5%) and 3 (2.3%) patients in the gentamicin-collagen sponge and control groups, respectively (p&lt;0.999). The following factors showed a statistically significant association with SSIs: body mass index &gt;25 kg/m 2 (odds ratio, 39.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.90–802.21; p = 0.018), liver disease (odds ratio, 254.8; 95% confidence interval, 10.43–6222.61; p = 0.001), and right hemicolectomy (odds ratio, 36.22; 95% confidence interval, 2.37–554.63; p = 0.010). Conclusion Applying a gentamicin-collagen sponge to the mini-laparotomy wound did not reduce the frequency of SSIs. Further studies should be conducted on whether the selective use of gentamicin-collagen sponges may help reduce SSIs in high-risk patients."
https://openalex.org/W4220703046,"The COVID-19 related lockdown made it much more difficult for people to control their eating behaviours and body weight with the methods and means they had used before. This is reflected in reports that show that eating behaviours deteriorated significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic (including in Poland). Therefore, it is important to determine what factors may be conducive to healthy eating behaviours among people with different BMI. As previous studies show, the use of healthy eating related-apps and training programs may be a protective factor against the development of unhealthy eating behaviours. Therefore, it is worth checking whether their action will be a protective factor during COVID-19. The aim of this cross sectional study was to analyse whether the current use of healthy eating-related apps and previous participation in training in this field (educational activities) as well as body mass index may play a role in eating motives and behaviours among women during COVID-19. Our final sample included 1,447 women (age: M = 31.34 ± 11.05). Participants completed: the Eating Motivation Survey, the Emotional Overeating Questionnaire, the Mindful Eating Questionnaire, socio-demographic survey and questions about healthy eating-related apps and training (educational activities). Referring to the selected significant results, our study shows that during COVID-19, the use of healthy eating-related apps alone, as well as the use of apps and prior training participation promote healthy eating motives and behaviours. It suggests that promoting the use of healthy eating applications and the acquisition of knowledge and skills in this field could be one way of shaping resources that can be effectively used to deal with crisis situations."

We hypothesized that their masculinity was influenced by exposure to elevated levels of prenatal androgen during early development. We recruited 199 women (including 67 homosexual women) and measured their masculinity via self-report and observer ratings. Our measure of prenatal androgen exposure was the ratio of the index to ring finger (2D:4D), which is hypothesized to be lower in women exposed to elevated levels of androgens during prenatal development. Homosexual women were substantially more masculine than heterosexual women in both self-report and observer ratings. However, homosexual women neither had more male-typical finger length ratios, nor did their finger length ratios relate to their masculinity in any predicted direction. Thus, we found no evidence that increased prenatal androgen exposure influenced masculinity in homosexual women."

However, the role of Glul in regulating endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS)-induced sepsis remains unclear. Here, we found that Glul expression in macrophages was significantly inhibited in endotoxemia, and that Glul deletion induced macrophages to differentiate into the pro-inflammatory type and aggravated sepsis in mice. Mechanistically, TLR4/NF-κB-induced alpha-ketoglutarate (α-KG) depletion inhibits Glul expression through H3K27me3-mediated methylation in septic mice. Both Glul overexpression with adeno-associated virus (AAV) and restoration by replenishing α-KG can alleviate the severity of sepsis. In conclusion, the study demonstrated that Glul can regulate LPS-induced sepsis and provides a novel strategy for the treatment of this disease."
https://openalex.org/W4220788169,"The distortion measurement plays an important role in panoramic image processing. Most measurement algorithms judge the panoramic image quality by means of weighting the quality of the local areas. However, such a calculation fails to globally reflect the quality of the panoramic image. Therefore, the multi-region adjacent pixels correlation (MRAPC) is proposed as the efficient feature for no-reference panoramic images quality assessment in this paper. Specifically, from the perspective of the statistical characteristics, the differences of the adjacent pixels in panoramic image are proved to be highly related to the degree of distortion and independent of image content. Besides, the difference map has limited pixel value range, which can improve the efficiency of quality assessment. Based on these advantages, the proposed MRAPC feature collaborates with the support vector regression to globally predict the quality of panoramic images. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed no-reference panoramic image quality assessment algorithm achieves higher evaluation performance than the existing algorithms."
https://openalex.org/W4220812911,"Maternal malnutrition is associated with decreased nutrient transfer to the foetus, which may lead to foetal growth restriction, predisposing children to a variety of diseases. However, regulation of placental nutrient transfer during decreased nutrient availability is not fully understood. In the present study, the aim was to investigate changes in levels of placental nutrient transporters accompanying maternal hypoglycaemia following different durations and stages of gestation in rats. Maternal hypoglycaemia was induced by insulin-infusion throughout gestation until gestation day (GD)20 or until end of organogenesis (GD17), with sacrifice on GD17 or GD20. Protein levels of placental glucose transporters GLUT1 (45/55 kDa isotypes) and GLUT3, amino acid transporters SNAT1 and SNAT2, and insulin receptor (InsR) were assessed. On GD17, GLUT1-45, GLUT3, and SNAT1 levels were increased and InsR levels decreased versus controls. On GD20, following hypoglycaemia throughout gestation, GLUT3 levels were increased, GLUT1-55 showed the same trend. After cessation of hypoglycaemia at end of organogenesis, GLUT1-55, GLUT3, and InsR levels were increased versus controls, whereas SNAT1 levels were decreased. The increases in levels of placental nutrient transporters seen during maternal hypoglycaemia and hyperinsulinemia likely reflect an adaptive response to optimise foetal nutrient supply and development during limited availability of glucose."
https://openalex.org/W4220855455,"Secretion of the acrosome, a single vesicle located rostrally in the head of a mammalian sperm, through a process known as “acrosome exocytosis” (AE), is essential for fertilization. However, the mechanisms leading to and regulating this complex process are controversial. In particular, poor understanding of Ca2+ dynamics between sperm subcellular compartments and regulation of membrane fusion mechanisms have led to competing models of AE. Here, we developed a transgenic mouse expressing an Acrosome-targeted Sensor for Exocytosis (AcroSensE) to investigate the spatial and temporal Ca2+ dynamics in AE in live sperm. AcroSensE combines a genetically encoded Ca2+ indicator (GCaMP) fused with an mCherry indicator to spatiotemporally resolve acrosomal Ca2+ rise (ACR) and membrane fusion events, enabling real-time study of AE. We found that ACR is dependent on extracellular Ca2+ and that ACR precedes AE. In addition, we show that there are intermediate steps in ACR and that AE correlates better with the ACR rate rather than absolute Ca2+ amount. Finally, we demonstrate that ACR and membrane fusion progression kinetics and spatial patterns differ with different stimuli and that sites of initiation of ACR and sites of membrane fusion do not always correspond. These findings support a model involving functionally redundant pathways that enable a highly regulated, multistep AE in heterogeneous sperm populations, unlike the previously proposed “acrosome reaction” model.

These findings support a model involving functionally redundant pathways that enable a highly regulated, multistep AE in heterogeneous sperm populations, unlike the previously proposed “acrosome reaction” model. The “acrosome reaction” model involves receptors on the sperm membrane being triggered by physical contact with ligands on the zona pellucida (ZP), resulting in exocytosis of the acrosome, the sperm’s single exocytotic vesicle. This long-dominant model defines two states or conditions for sperm—acrosome-intact or acrosome-reacted. In this model, it is thought that creating pores between the plasma membrane and outer acrosomal membrane (OAM) would result in loss of acrosomal contents in a manner analogous to popping a water balloon. Almost 2 decades of data challenge this thinking, suggesting a more complex, multistep model of “acrosome exocytosis” (AE). However, the acrosome reaction model has proven remarkably persistent, due both to its simplicity and lack of precise understanding of the steps involved in AE. The multistep AE model is based on numerous lines of evidence from different laboratories, including that putative receptors for the ZP are found in the acrosomal matrix (1Kim K.S. Cha M.C.

First, sterol efflux enables proteolytic activation of phospholipase B, which cleaves both tails of a phospholipid molecule (21Asano A. Nelson-Harrington J.L. Travis A.J.

Second, sterol efflux enables GM1 regulation of the CaV2.3 voltage-gated Ca2+ channel, giving rise to Ca2+ transients that facilitate AE in response to subsequent Ca2+ waves in the sperm’s head (23Cohen R.

Cell. 2014; 28: 310-321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Along with these roles, sterol efflux also exerts broad regulatory functions, such as facilitating intracellular alkalinization through activation of the sperm proton channel Hv1 in human sperm (24Lishko P.V.

The SLO3 sperm-specific potassium channel plays a vital role in male fertility.FEBS Lett. 2010; 584: 1041-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Both alkalinization and hyperpolarization are critical steps for capacitation and AE to occur (27De La Vega-Beltran J.L. Sanchez-Cardenas C. Krapf D. Hernandez-Gonzalez E.O. Wertheimer E.

Cell Physiol. 2018; 233: 4735-4747Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).As a complement to these membrane lipid–regulated pathways, progesterone (P4) is also a critical regulator of sperm function. Released by cumulus cells and encountered by sperm in the vicinity of the egg, P4 has been reported to facilitate multiple events in sperm including stimulation of capacitation (29de Lamirande E. Harakat A. Gagnon C. Human sperm capacitation induced by biological fluids and progesterone, but not by NADH or NADPH, is associated with the production of superoxide anion.J.

Biphasic elevation of [Ca(2+)](i) in individual human spermatozoa exposed to progesterone.Dev. Biol. 2000; 222: 326-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar); these Ca2+ elevations are mediated by the CatSper channel (37Navarro B. Kirichok Y. Chung J.J. Clapham D.E.

Patch clamping data have sometimes been interpreted to suggest that CatSper is the only active Ca2+ channel in sperm, as opposed to previous models in which multiple channels contribute to Ca2+ transients and waves that culminate in release from internal stores and activation of store-operated channels.To investigate some of the complexities of AE and Ca2+ dynamics in sperm, we generated a novel mouse model with a genetically encoded Ca2+-sensor (GCaMP3) in fusion with mCherry that we targeted to the acrosome. This positions it both to reflect Ca2+ concentrations in that compartment and reflect the status of the acrosomal contents, in live sperm, in real time, under physiological conditions. As a component of the matrix, loss of the photostable and pH-insensitive mCherry fluorescence from the sperm would reflect membrane fusion (MF) and AE akin to the acrosome-targeted GFP mouse line (2Kim K.S.

We hypothesized that this combination of features could also reveal fusion pore (FP) formation as indicated by Ca2+ influx into the acrosome lumen, a point of contention between the models.We selected a GCaMP variant for our transgenic mouse line based on reported Ca2+ concentrations in the acrosome of between 256 μM and 1.02 mM (41Herrick S.B. Schweissinger D.L. Kim S.W. Bayan K.R. Mann S. Cardullo R.A. The acrosomal vesicle of mouse sperm is a calcium store.J. Cell. Physiol. 2005; 202: 663-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This led us to choose a lower affinity variant GCaMP (GCaMP3/GCaMPer) originally developed to monitor Ca2+ in the endoplasmic reticulum. GCaMP3 has a Kd of approximately 400 μM, with good dynamic range for Ca2+ concentrations between 10−4 and 10−3 M (42Henderson M.J. Baldwin H.A. Werley C.A. Boccardo S. Whitaker L.R. Yan X. Holt G.T. Schreiter E.R. Looger L.L. Cohen A.E. Kim D.S. Harvey B.K. A low affinity GCaMP3 variant (GCaMPer) for imaging the endoplasmic reticulum calcium store.PLoS One. 2015; 10e0139273Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In addition to the GCaMP component, we also added the bright monomeric mCherry as a non–Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent protein to enable visualization of the acrosome while the GCaMP3 signal is dim (e.g., prior to Ca2+ binding). We targeted the GCaMP–mCherry fusion protein to the acrosome using the acrosin promotor and signaling peptide (39Nakanishi T. Ikawa M. Yamada S. Parvinen M. Baba T. Nishimune Y. Okabe M. Real-time observation of acrosomal dispersal from mouse sperm using GFP as a marker protein.FEBS Lett. 1999; 449: 277-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar).Here, we characterize this novel model (Acrosome-targeted Sensor for Exocytosis [AcroSensE]) and then use it experimentally to inform our understanding of AE and sperm Ca2+ dynamics. For these initial studies, we chose stimuli that sperm would encounter in the vicinity of the egg (P4) or that would mimic sterol acceptors found in the female tract in a reductionist, controlled way (i.e., 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin [CD] as a chemically defined mediator of sterol efflux versus oviductal albumin or high-density lipoproteins), or stimuli that exist on sperm but are released from inhibition provided by the binding of seminal plasma proteins (GM1). Data generated from these AcroSensE mice support a complex, multistep AE model and are inconsistent with the traditional acrosome reaction model, helping resolve the existing controversy and providing new insights into functionally redundant mechanisms regulating sperm AE.ResultsProduction and validation of the AcroSensE mouse modelTo generate the AcroSensE plasmid, we replaced the GFP sequence in the pAcr3-EGFP backbone plasmid (39Nakanishi T. Ikawa M. Yamada S. Parvinen M. Baba T. Nishimune Y. Okabe M. Real-time observation of acrosomal dispersal from mouse sperm using GFP as a marker protein.FEBS Lett. 1999; 449: 277-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) with a cassette comprising the low-affinity GCaMP3 (42Henderson M.J. Baldwin H.A. Werley C.A. Boccardo S. Whitaker L.R. Yan X. Holt G.T. Schreiter E.R. Looger L.L. Cohen A.E. Kim D.S. Harvey B.K.

The mCherry and GCaMP3 were coupled by a 23-aa linker (flexible alanine–proline repeat linker (43Shui B. Lee J.C. Reining S. Lee F.K. Kotlikoff M.I. Optogenetic sensors and effectors: CHROMus-the cornell heart lung Blood institute resource for optogenetic mouse signaling.Front. Physiol. 2014; 5: 428Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Transgenic founders were obtained by injecting the linearized AcroSensE plasmid into the pronucleus of 100+ fertilized embryos obtained by mating C57BL6/J and CBA F1 hybrids (Stem Cell and Transgenic Core Facility). Transgenic founders were backcrossed to C57BL/6 mice. Insertion of the target construct in the transgenic founders was verified by genomic PCR, using primers targeting the GCaMP3 region of the AcroSensE construct. To validate expression of the transgene, we first determined the expression levels of AcroSensE in various tissues. Figure 1B shows the results of RT-PCR analysis of AcroSensE demonstrating the highest transcript levels in the liver and testes. However, immunoblots of protein extracts using an antibody against the GFP backbone of the GCaMP3 (1 ng/μl, Abcam, Cambridge, MA) demonstrated that the AcroSensE protein was expressed predominantly in testes (Fig. 1C). Moreover, we were not able to detect expression of the AcroSensE construct at the protein level in any tissue but sperm using fluorescence microscopy (detected via the mCherry fluorescence; data not shown).Resolution of intermediate MF steps during AESperm from AcroSensE mice were collected as previously described (23Cohen R. Buttke D.E. Asano A. Mukai C. Nelson J.L. Ren D. Miller R.J. Cohen-Kutner M. Atlas D. Travis A.J. Lipid modulation of calcium flux through CaV2.3 regulates acrosome exocytosis and fertilization.Dev. Cell. 2014; 28: 310-321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Following incubation for 30 to 60 min at 37 °C in the presence or absence of 3 mM CD and 10 mM bicarbonate as indicated, sperm were placed on a polylysine-coated coverslide dish (MatTek Corp) and imaged on a Zeiss LSM 510, with a controlled delivery system for local administration of ionophore A23187, GM1, CD, or P4. Preincubation of populations of sperm under capacitating conditions was performed with some stimuli (CD with/without bicarbonate) to mimic the physiological timeline when sterol efflux would occur relative to the effects of those other molecules (e.g., GM1 and P4). To stimulate exocytosis in single cells, a short (10 s) puff of stimulant was applied near an individual sperm via micropipette while recording the changes in GCaMP3 and mCherry fluorescence intensities at image rates of up to 5 frames per second for each wavelength. Concentrations are indicated for the solution in the micropipette, as specified in the Experimental procedures section.To understand baseline effects and aid interpretation, we quantified the percentage of w.t. B6 sperm undergoing AE as a result of initial incubation under noncapacitating and capacitating conditions (Fig. S1). Using Coomassie staining, we found that 21.7% of the cells underwent AE in response to a 30-min incubation (at 37 °C) with 3 mM CD or 24.6% of cells with 25 μM GM1 (data from 3 mice each, counting at least 180 cells in each condition). Under noncapacitating control conditions (no CD or GM1), 10.7% of sperm underwent AE. After 90 min, 36.3% of sperm underwent AE in response to GM1, 45.2% in response to CD, and 47.1% in response to both CD and GM1. At this time point, the value for noncapacitating conditions also increased to 25%. These percentages are similar to our prior observations (23Cohen R. Buttke D.E. Asano A. Mukai C. Nelson J.L. Ren D. Miller R.J. Cohen-Kutner M. Atlas D. Travis A.J. Lipid modulation of calcium flux through CaV2.3 regulates acrosome exocytosis and fertilization.Dev. Cell. 2014; 28: 310-321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Because the sperm that responded to the preincubation by undergoing MF and AE would have lost both their GCaMP3 and mCherry signals prior to encountering the other stimuli in our experimental approach, they would not be observed and quantified in the live imaging experiments. That is, any sperm undergoing spontaneous AE or AE in response to preincubation did not contribute to the subpopulations showing acrosomal Ca2+ rise (ACR) and MF upon stimulation with various reagents mentioned in the following part of the article.After preincubation for 30 min, the AcroSensE sperm were then imaged. In each trial, sperm from multiple mice were pooled, and typically only 1 to 2 of the experimental conditions described here were tested per trial to ensure that length of preincubation would not be a confounding factor in interpreting results from different conditions. Under these experimental conditions, we observed several steps in the process leading to AE, consistent with ACR, and full MF leading to loss of the mCherry fluorescence and therefore full AE. In some cells, we saw traces similar to prespike foot (PSF) events as frequently observed when using amperometry to study exocytosis; however, these were on a much slower time course than when observed in other cells using amperometry. Although temporally these PSF-like events were the earliest events we observed using AcroSensE fluorescence, they were observed infrequently and only under specific circumstances. Therefore, we will first describe the more common ACR and MF responses to the different treatment conditions.Figure 2 provides traces demonstrating either representative changes in the GCaMP3 and mCherry fluorescence intensities following various stimulations or changes shown in specific subpopulations of sperm deserving special mention (Fig. 2, A and D; note that population data are summarized in Fig. 3, B and C). Following the addition of ionophore A23187, one subpopulation of sperm demonstrated rapid ACR which was typically quickly followed by MF as evidenced by loss of mCherry signal (Fig. 2A, left panel; 40% of responding sperm). In contrast, the remaining 60% of sperm responding to A23187 showed a slow, gradual ACR that did not result in AE within the time frame of image acquisition (until AE occurred or up to 8 min, Fig. 2A right panel).Figure 2Representative traces of changes in fluorescence reflecting different Ca2+ and membrane fusion dynamics under various conditions.

https://openalex.org/W4221005032,"The growing risk of new variants of the influenza A virus is the most significant to public health. The risk imposed from new variants may have been lethal, as witnessed in the year 2009. Even though the improvement in predicting antigenicity of influenza viruses has rapidly progressed, few studies employed deep learning methodologies. The most recent literature mostly relied on classification techniques, while a model that generates the HA protein of the antigenic variant is not developed. However, the antigenic pair of influenza virus A can be determined in a laboratory setup, the process needs a tremendous amount of time and labor. Antigenic shift and drift which are caused by changes in surface protein favored the influenza A virus in evading immunity. The high frequency of the minor changes in the surface protein poses a challenge to identifying the antigenic variant of an emerging virus. These changes slow down vaccine selection and the manufacturing process. In this vein, the proposed model could help save the time and efforts exerted to identify the antigenic pair of the influenza virus. The proposed model utilized an end-to-end learning methodology relying on deep sequence-to-sequence architecture to generate the antigenic variant of a given influenza A virus using surface protein. Employing the BLEU score to evaluate the generated HA protein of the antigenic variant of influenza virus A against the actual variant, the proposed model achieved a mean accuracy of 97.57%."

In the first step, pseudouridine kinase (PUKI) phosphorylates pseudouridine to pseudouridine 5′-monophosphate. High-fidelity catalysis of pseudouridine by PUKI prevents possible disturbance of in vivo pyrimidine homeostasis. However, the molecular basis of how PUKI selectively phosphorylates pseudouridine over uridine with >100-fold greater efficiency despite minor differences in their Km values has not been elucidated. To investigate this selectivity, in this study we determined the structures of PUKI from Escherichia coli strain B (EcPUKI) in various ligation states. The structure of EcPUKI was determined to be similar to PUKI from Arabidopsis thaliana, including an α/β core domain and β-stranded small domain, with dimerization occurring via the β-stranded small domain. In a binary complex, we show that Ser30 in the substrate-binding loop of the small domain mediates interactions with the hallmark N1 atom of pseudouridine nucleobase, causing conformational changes in its quaternary structure. Kinetic and fluorescence spectroscopic analyses also showed that the Ser30-mediated interaction is a prerequisite for conformational changes and subsequent catalysis by EcPUKI. Furthermore, S30A mutation or EcPUKI complexed with other nucleosides homologous to pseudouridine but lacking the pseudouridine-specific N1 atom did not induce such conformational changes, demonstrating the catalytic significance of the proposed Ser30-mediated interaction.

In particular, pseudouridine catabolism was first suggested in pyrimidine auxotrophic Escherichia coli mutants (13Breitman T.R. Pseudouridulate synthetase of Escherichia coli: Correlation of its activity with utilization of pseudouridine for growth.J. Bacteriol. 1970; 103: 263-264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thirty-eight years later, two enzymes in the pathway—YeiC and YeiN—were identified (14Preumont A. Snoussi K. Stroobant V. Collet J.F. Van Schaftingen E. Molecular identification of pseudouridine-metabolizing enzymes.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 25238-25246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Details regarding pseudouridine catabolism, with its physiological consequences, were gleaned from studies of Arabidopsis (15Chen M. Witte C.P. A kinase and a glycosylase catabolize pseudouridine in the peroxisome to prevent toxic pseudouridine monophosphate accumulation.Plant Cell. 2020; 32: 722-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). A lack of high sequence conservation from E. coli to eukaryotes hampered the identification of genes involved in pseudouridine catabolism within Arabidopsis thaliana. The metabolic turnover of pseudouridine-containing RNAs in vacuole produces pseudouridine monophosphate, which is dephosphorylated and exported to the peroxisome via the cytosol. In the peroxisome, pseudouridine is converted into uracil and ribose-5′-phosphate by two consecutive reactions that correspond to the activities of YeiC and YeiN, respectively, from E. coli. Therefore, the pseudouridine catabolic pathway recycles metabolic intermediates of uracil and ribose-5′-phosphate for use in other metabolic pathways.Pseudouridine kinase (PUKI), a member of the phosphofructokinase B (PfkB) family (16Park J. Gupta R.S. Adenosine kinase and ribokinase--the RK family of proteins.Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2008; 65: 2875-2896Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), catalyzes the first of the two consecutive reactions (15Chen M. Witte C.P. A kinase and a glycosylase catabolize pseudouridine in the peroxisome to prevent toxic pseudouridine monophosphate accumulation.Plant Cell. 2020; 32: 722-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). PUKI phosphorylates pseudouridine to pseudouridine 5′-monophosphate in an ATP-dependent manner (Fig. 1A); in the second step, pseudouridine 5′-monophosphate is hydrolyzed into uracil and ribose-5′-phosphate by pseudouridine monophosphate glycosylase. Recently, we performed a structural analysis of PUKI from A. thaliana (AtPUKI) and disclosed the structural basis for its substrate specificity toward pseudouridine (17Kim S.H. Witte C.P. Rhee S. Structural basis for the substrate specificity and catalytic features of pseudouridine kinase from Arabidopsis thaliana.Nucleic Acids Res. 2021; 49: 491-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The enzyme efficiency (i.e., kcat/Km) was 100-fold greater for pseudouridine than for structurally homologous uridine, despite minor differences in their Km values. These observations led us to postulate that AtPUKI catalytically distinguishes pseudouridine from uridine possibly by pseudouridine-induced conformational changes.Here, we conducted a structural analysis of PUKI from E. coli strain B (EcPUKI) in the absence or the presence of pseudouridine, uridine, or cytidine. We also performed kinetic and fluorescence spectroscopic analyses. These findings provide structural and functional evidence concerning the pseudouridine-dependent conformational change in PUKI and its functional linkage to catalysis.Results and discussionPhylogenetic analysis of PUKIs in the PfkB proteinsThe sequence identity of full-length EcPUKI and AtPUKI is low (21%). We therefore investigated the evolutionary relationship of PUKIs in PfkB proteins using local structural information for AtPUKI (17Kim S.H. Witte C.P. Rhee S. Structural basis for the substrate specificity and catalytic features of pseudouridine kinase from Arabidopsis thaliana.Nucleic Acids Res. 2021; 49: 491-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Before the construction of a phylogenetic tree, AtPUKI homologs were identified using the BLAST (18Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Gapped BLAST and PSI-BLAST: A new generation of protein database search programs.Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59182) Google Scholar) by querying the full-length AtPUKI. The top 20 proteins ranked by similarity score were subjected to homology modeling in SWISS-MODEL (19Waterhouse A. Bertoni M. Bienert S. Studer G. Tauriello G. Gumienny R. Heer F.T. de Beer T.A.P. Rempfer C. Bordoli L. Lepore R. Schwede T. SWISS-MODEL: Homology modelling of protein structures and complexes.Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46: W296-W303Crossref PubMed Scopus (4837) Google Scholar) using AtPUKI (Protein Data Bank [PDB] ID: 7C1X) as the template. This modeling allowed us to identify the ligand-binding region with two hydrophilic active site residues; those residues correspond to positions 137 and 166 in AtPUKI, which are crucial for pseudouridine affinity (17Kim S.H. Witte C.P. Rhee S. Structural basis for the substrate specificity and catalytic features of pseudouridine kinase from Arabidopsis thaliana.Nucleic Acids Res. 2021; 49: 491-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) was performed using amino acid sequences containing the two active site residues (20Bodenhofer U. Bonatesta E. Horejš-Kainrath C. Hochreiter S. msa: an R package for multiple sequence alignment.Bioinformatics. 2015; 31: 3997-3999PubMed Google Scholar). This demonstrated the conservation of N (Asn) and K (Lys) in EcPUKI and AtPUKI (Fig. 1B). Notably, phylogenetic analysis revealed that EcPUKI and AtPUKI, together with E. coli YeiI, whose function is unknown, are evolutionarily closer than other PfkB proteins, such as ribokinases (RBSKs) (Fig. 1C). Pairwise distances for the alignments confirmed that functionally equivalent PfkB family proteins (ortholog) exhibit high sequence identities (Fig. 1D). The active site regions of PUKI were conserved between E. coli and A. thaliana, although the full sequences were phylogenetically distant. Therefore, EcPUKI and AtPUKI are homologous based on the similarity of two active site residues and the local structure.Structure of EcPUKI in the absence of substrateIn the crystal structure of unliganded EcPUKI at 2.15 Å resolution, the asymmetric unit of the space group P3 has two dimers (Table 1). The dimerization of EcPUKI in solution was characterized by size-exclusion chromatography (Fig. 2A). Therefore, the dimer is a biological functional unit. From a structural perspective, the four protomers in the two dimers are essentially identical, with an RMSD of 0.19 to 0.21 Å for about 307 Cα atoms.Table 1Data collection and refinement statisticsDatasetUnliganded EcPUKIEcPUKI–ΨEcPUKI–uridineEcPUKI–cytidineS30A–ΨPDB ID7VTD7VVA7VTE7VTF7VTGData collection CrystalNativeNativeNativeNativeNative Wavelength (Å)0.979340.979320.979320.979320.97932 Resolution (Å)50.0–2.1550.0–2.7550.0–2.1550.0–2.2050.0–1.90(2.23–2.15)aNumbers in parentheses refer to data in the highest resolution shell.(2.85–2.75)(2.23–2.15)(2.28–2.20)(1.97–1.90) Unique reflections104,84292,181104,99299,598155,963 Multiplicity5.4 (5.2)3.5 (3.5)5.5 (5.3)5.3 (4.9)5.2 (4.7) Completeness (%)99.7 (100)99.7 (99.8)99.7 (100)99.8 (100)99.6 (100) Mean I/sigma(I)15.0 (0.89)7.7 (1.0)12.7 (0.69)13.0 (0.57)15.3 (0.84) Wilson B-factors (Å2)49.652.852.954.335.7 RmergebRmerge =ΣIh − <Ih>|/ΣIh, where Ih is the observed intensity and <Ih> is the average intensity.0.13 (1.76)0.20 (1.98)0.15 (2.41)0.14 (2.47)0.11 (1.84) CC1/2cThe CC1/2 is the Pearson correlation coefficient (CC) calculated from each subset containing a random half of the measurements of unique reflection.0.99 (0.50)0.95 (0.34)0.98 (0.45)0.99 (0.49)0.96 (0.43)Space groupP3P21P3P3P3 Unit cell a, b, c (Å)186.8, 186.8, 49.772.0, 271.9, 101.2185.7, 185.7, 50.8186.0, 186.0, 51.0185.1, 185.1, 51.7 α, β, γ (º)90.0, 90.0, 120.090.0, 110.9, 90.090.0, 90.0, 120.090.0, 90.0, 120.090.0, 90.0, 120.0Refinement RworkdRwork = Σ||Fobs| − |Fcal||/Σ|Fobs|.

Gupta R.S. Adenosine kinase and ribokinase--the RK family of proteins.Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2008; 65: 2875-2896Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). EcPUKI, with 11 α-helices and 14 β-strands, is folded into an α/β core domain, with a protruding four β-stranded small domain (Figs. 2, B and C, S1). In the core domain, 10 β-strands form the central β-sheet, in the order β6–β5–β4–β1–β9–β10–β11–β12–β13–β14. These β-strands are parallel, except for β13. The β-stranded small domain, which comprises β2, β3 and β7, β8, is bent toward the α/β core domain, forming a substrate-binding pocket between the two domains (see the subsection Pseudouridine-induced conformational changes). The β-stranded small domains of the two subunits are responsible for dimerization of EcPUKI (Fig. 2D) by forming a β-clasp motif; this motif was first characterized in RBSK of E. coli (EcRBSK), a member of the PfkB family (21Sigrell J.A.

In particular, a loop in β2–β3 (green in Fig. 2D; His22 to Pro32, including Ser30, in Fig. S1) in a small domain of one subunit (orange) transverses into the substrate-binding pocket of the adjacent subunit (gray), forming the substrate-binding loop for catalysis.These structural features are comparable to the features of AtPUKI, including the substrate-binding loop. A structural homology search using program DALI (22Holm L. Laakso L.M. Dali server update.Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44: W351-W355Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar) indicated that a monomeric EcPUKI exhibited high similarity to AtPUKI (PDB ID: 7C1Y; Z-score, 39.2; sequence identity, 21%; and RMSD of 1.76 Å for the 267 Cα atoms) (17Kim S.H.

In a previous structural and kinetic study of AtPUKI (17Kim S.H. Witte C.P. Rhee S. Structural basis for the substrate specificity and catalytic features of pseudouridine kinase from Arabidopsis thaliana.Nucleic Acids Res. 2021; 49: 491-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), we proposed that pseudouridine-induced conformational changes are required for catalysis. Those changes in conformation likely cause two substrates, pseudouridine and ATP, to be properly oriented for a kinase reaction. However, the proposed structural features were not unraveled in a ternary complex of AtPUKI with pseudouridine and ADP; only minor changes were identified (17Kim S.H. Witte C.P. Rhee S. Structural basis for the substrate specificity and catalytic features of pseudouridine kinase from Arabidopsis thaliana.Nucleic Acids Res. 2021; 49: 491-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), compared with the large conformational changes in EcRBSK (21Sigrell J.A. Cameron A.D. Jones T.A. Mowbray S.L.

Cameron A.D. Mowbray S.L. Induced fit on sugar binding activates ribokinase.J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 1009-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Analogous to EcRBSK and AtPUKI, we also adopted the Cα-interatomic distance as an indicator of conformational changes. Ser200, which is located at the edge of the core domain, was selected as the indicator residue (Fig. 2D). In unliganded EcPUKI, the Cα-interatomic distance between Ser200 and Ser200∗ (asterisk indicates a residue or an element from an adjacent subunit) in the two subunits was approximately 66 Å.Pseudouridine-induced conformational changesThe 2.75 Å resolution crystal structure of EcPUKI complexed with pseudouridine provides structural evidence for conformational changes upon binding of pseudouridine (Fig. 3A). This binary structure, which has eight monomers in the asymmetric unit of the space group P21 (Table 1), exhibits two features. In each dimer, pseudouridine is present in only one subunit (gray in Fig. 3A). The other subunit shows a highly disordered structure in some regions. In particular, two pseudouridine-unbound subunits among the eight monomers had a disordered electron density. However, the Cα tracing in the other subunits was reliable. In an overall structure of the binary complex, the Cα-interatomic distance indicator was ∼51 Å (Fig. 3A), compared with ∼66 Å for unliganded EcPUKI, revealing global conformational changes upon binding of pseudouridine. These changes in quaternary structure are attributable to the β-stranded small domain, rather than the α/β core domain. The structural superposition of the corresponding subunit in unliganded EcPUKI and its binary complex resulted in an RMSD of 0.5 Å for 251 Cα atoms for the α/β core domain. Large structural differences are associated with the β-stranded small domain, with positional changes of up to approximately 9 Å in the substrate-binding loop between the corresponding Cα atoms (Fig. S2). Thus, the β-stranded small domain in a binary complex is more bent toward the α/β core domain, compared with that of unliganded EcPUKI. In dimeric EcPUKI, these dynamic features of the β-stranded small domain result in global conformational changes upon binding of pseudouridine, effectively sealing off pseudouridine for catalysis.Figure 3Structural insights into the binary complex of wildtype EcPUKI and S30A mutant with pseudouridine.

Specifically, the ribosyl moiety forms several interactions within ∼3.3 Å with nearby residues: Asp16 with O2′ and O3’; Asn14 with O2’; and Asp256, a proposed catalytic base, with O5′, to which the γ-phosphate group of ATP is attached. The uracil-Ψ moiety is surrounded by Tyr97, Asn112, and Met114 on one side and by the hydrophilic residues Ser30∗, Asn143, and Lys170 (Fig. 3B). There are possible hydrogen bonds within ∼3.5 Å around the uracil-Ψ moiety: N3 and O4 of the base with Asn143 via bidentate interactions, O2 with Lys170, and N1 with Ser30∗, a residue of the substrate-binding loop of the adjacent subunit.Considering crystal packing interactions could affect the conformational state(s) of EcPUKI, we analyzed those packing interactions of unliganded EcPUKI in the P3 space group and in a binary complex with pseudouridine in the P21 space group (Table 1). In the PISA (Protein Interfaces, Surfaces and Assemblies) analysis (25Krissinel E. Henrick K. Inference of macromolecular assemblies from crystalline state.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372: 774-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (6606) Google Scholar), the interface area for crystal packing around a particular monomer was calculated. Although the two space groups had similar interface area values (2894 Å2 for P3 and 2737 Å2 for P21), a small number of crystal contacts in the critical regions could affect the conformational freedom of molecules. Therefore, we still cannot rule out the possible effects of crystal contacts on the changes in EcPUKI conformation. Consistent with the crystal structure of EcPUKI complexed with pseudouridine, further structural analysis, mutagenesis, and fluorescence spectroscopy of various EcPUKIs in the current study unanimously support the pseudouridine-induced conformational changes of EcPUKI.Catalysis of EcPUKIThe binding environment of pseudouridine in EcPUKI is comparable to that of pseudouridine in AtPUKI (17Kim S.H.

In AtPUKI, there are variations in the hydrophobic residues around the uracil-Ψ moiety, but three hydrophilic residues were identified: Asn137AtPUKI, Lys166AtPUKI, and Thr26AtPUKI (superscript AtPUKI indicates residue(s) in AtPUKI) (Fig. 1B). Three residues, which differ in Thr26AtPUKI and Ser30EcPUKI, are hallmarks of PUKI family proteins.EcPUKI residues interacting with a uracil-Ψ have crucial roles in enzyme activity.

PRPH2 mutations cause a multitude of retinal diseases characterized by the degeneration of photoreceptors as well as defects in neighboring tissues such as the RPE. While extensive research has analyzed photoreceptors, less attention has been paid to these secondary defects. Here, we use different Prph2 disease models to evaluate the damage of the RPE arising from photoreceptor defects. In Prph2 disease models, the RPE exhibits structural abnormalities and cell loss. Furthermore, RPE functional defects are observed, including impaired clearance of phagocytosed outer segment material and increased microglia activation. The severity of RPE damage is different between models, suggesting that the different abnormal outer segment structures caused by Prph2 disease mutations lead to varying degrees of RPE stress and thus influence the clinical phenotype observed in patients."
https://openalex.org/W4220786992,"The effects of oil and gas production on adjacent groundwater quality are becoming a concern in many areas of the United States. As a result, it has become increasingly important to identify which aquifers require monitoring and protection. In this study, we map the extent of groundwater with less than 10,000 mg/L TDS both laterally and vertically near the Elk Hills, Buena Vista and Coles Levee Oil Fields in the San Joaquin Valley, California and note evidence of effects of produced water disposal on salinity within the Tulare aquifer. Subsurface maps showing the depth at which groundwater salinity is less than 10,000 mg/L (or Base 10K) in the Tulare aquifer are generated using geophysical logs and verified by comparison to water sample analyses. The depth to Base 10K ranges from 240 m (800 ft) in Elk Hills to 800 m (2650 ft) in the adjacent Buena Vista syncline and is 670 m (2,200 ft) deep in the Coles Levee area to the east. Log-calculated salinities show a relatively smooth increase with depth prior to disposal activities whereas salinities calculated from logs collected near and after disposal activities show a more variable salinity profile with depth. The effect of produced water injection is represented by log resistivity profiles that change from low resistivity at the base of the sand to higher resistivity near the top due to density differences between the saline produced water and the brackish groundwater within each sand. Continued post-disposal logging in new wells in the 18G disposal area on the south flank of Elk Hills shows that injected water has migrated approximately 1,200 m (4,000 ft) downdip (south) over a period of 20 years since the inception of disposal activity."
https://openalex.org/W4220826234,"DNA polymerase eta (Pol η) is a eukaryotic member of the Y-family of DNA polymerase involved in translesion DNA synthesis and genome mutagenesis. Recently, several translesion DNA synthesis polymerases have been found to function in repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). However, the role of Pol η in promoting DSB repair remains to be well defined. Here, we demonstrated that Pol η could be targeted to etoposide (ETO)-induced DSBs and that depletion of Pol η in cells causes increased sensitivity to ETO. Intriguingly, depletion of Pol η also led to a nonhomologous end joining repair defect in a catalytic activity-independent manner. We further identified the scaffold protein Kap1 as a novel interacting partner of Pol η, the depletion of which resulted in impaired formation of Pol η and Rad18 foci after ETO treatment. Additionally, overexpression of Kap1 failed to restore Pol η focus formation in Rad18-deficient cells after ETO treatment. Interestingly, we also found that Kap1 bound to Rad18 in a Pol η-dependent manner, and moreover, depletion of Kap1 led to a significant reduction in Rad18-Pol η association, indicating that Kap1 forms a ternary complex with Rad18 and Pol η to stabilize Rad18-Pol η association. Our findings demonstrate that Kap1 could regulate the role of Pol η in ETO-induced DSB repair via facilitating Rad18 recruitment and stabilizing Rad18-Pol η association."
https://openalex.org/W4220844168,"Nucleotide excision repair functions to protect genome integrity, and ongoing studies using excision repair sequencing (XR-seq) have contributed to our understanding of how cells prioritize repair across the genome. In this method, the products of excision repair bearing damaged DNA are captured, sequenced, and then mapped genome-wide at single-nucleotide resolution. However, reagent requirements and complex procedures have limited widespread usage of this technique. In addition to the expense of these reagents, it has been hypothesized that the immunoprecipitation step using antibodies directed against damaged DNA may introduce bias in different sequence contexts. Here, we describe a newly developed adaptation called dA-tailing and adaptor ligation (ATL)-XR-seq, a relatively simple XR-seq method that avoids the use of immunoprecipitation targeting damaged DNA. ATL-XR-seq captures repair products by 3'-dA-tailing and 5'-adapter ligation instead of the original 5'- and 3'-dual adapter ligation. This new approach avoids adapter dimer formation during subsequent PCR, omits inefficient and time-consuming purification steps, and is very sensitive. In addition, poly(dA) tail length heterogeneity can serve as a molecular identifier, allowing more repair hotspots to be mapped. Importantly, a comparison of both repair mapping methods showed that no major bias is introduced by the anti-UV damage antibodies used in the original XR-seq procedure. Finally, we also coupled the described dA-tailing approach with quantitative PCR in a new method to quantify repair products. These new methods provide powerful and user-friendly tools to qualitatively and quantitatively measure excision repair."
https://openalex.org/W4220879461,"The incidence of breast cancer is increasing in low- and middle-income countries, including Thailand. However, its molecular immunohistochemical (M-IHC) subtypes have not been summarized in a population-based cancer registry. Thus, we aimed to estimate the breast cancer incidence and trends based on the hormone receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status. This cross-sectional study included 2,883 women diagnosed with primary invasive breast cancer between 2009 and 2018 from the Songkhla Cancer Registry. After imputing the missing values of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2 status, the cases were classified into four subtypes: HR+/HER2-, HR+/HER2+, HR-/HER2-, and HR-/HER2+. The age-specific incidence rate of 5-year age groups and age-standardized incidence rate (ASR) were calculated. An age-period-cohort (APC) model was used to describe the effects of age, birth cohort, and period of diagnosis. Finally, the incidence trends were extrapolated to 2030 based on the APC and joinpoint models. The results showed, HR+/HER2- had the highest ASR in breast cancer. The incidence trends of HR+/HER2- and HR+/HER2+ increased with an annual percent change of 5.4% (95%CI: 2.5% to 8.3%) and 10.1% (95%CI: 4.9% to 15.5%), respectively. The rate ratio was high in the younger generation and recent period of diagnosis. The joinpoint and APC model projections showed that the ASR of HR+/HER2- would reach 30.0 and 29.2 cases per 100,000 women, while ASR of the HR+/HER2+ would reach 8.8 and 10.4 cases per 100,000 women in 2030. On the other hand, the incidence trends of the HR-/HER2- and HR-/HER2+ subtypes were stable. The rising trends of HR-positive and a part of HER2-positive breast cancer forecast a dynamicity of the future health care budgeting, resource allocation, and provision of facilities."
https://openalex.org/W4220917958,"Cognitive paradigms induce changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) associated with increased metabolic demand, namely neurovascular coupling (NVC). We tested the hypothesis that the effect of complexity and duration of cognitive paradigms will either enhance or inhibit the NVC response. Bilateral CBF velocity (CBFV) in the middle cerebral arteries (MCAs) via transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD), blood pressure (BP), electrocardiogram (ECG) and end-tidal CO2 (EtCO2) of 16 healthy participants (aged 21-71 years) were simultaneously recorded at rest and during randomized paradigms of different complexities (naming words beginning with P-,R-,V- words and serial subtractions of 100-2,100-7,1000-17), and durations (5s, 30s and 60s). CBFV responses were population mean normalized from a 30-s baseline period prior to task initiation. A significant increase in bilateral CBFV response was observed at the start of all paradigms and provided a similar pattern in most responses, irrespective of complexity or duration. Although significant inter-hemispherical differences were found during performance of R-word and all serial subtraction paradigms, no lateralisation was observed in more complex naming word tasks. Also, the effect of duration was manifested at late stages of 100-7, but not for other paradigms. CBFV responses could not distinguish different levels of complexity or duration with a single presentation of the cognitive paradigm. Further studies of the ordinal scalability of the NVC response are needed with more advanced modelling techniques, or different types of neural stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W4220986388,"To assess the ability of 2D-Shear wave elastography (2D-SWE) to evaluate its reproducibility, to define the optimal orientation and size of the region of interest (ROI), and to differentiate benign from malignant inguinal lymph nodes (LNs).Thirty-two suspicious inguinal LNs from 21 patients were evaluated with 2D-SWE. SWE measurements were obtained in two orthogonal planes. To investigate reproducibility, sensitivity and specificity, circular ROIs with a diameter of 1 mm, 2 mm, 3 mm and 5 mm were placed on the cortex of the LNs. Additionally, one freehand ROI was drawn covering majority of the LN. Two observers performed five sets of SWE measurements for each ROI size. All LNs underwent core needle biopsy or were surgically removed.The 3 mm ROI for Mean-E in axial plane showed high interrater agreement [intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) 0.899] with the cut-off value of 7.31 kPa resulting in 88.9% sensitivity and 60.9% specificity for differentiating malignant from benign LNs. In benign LNs, mean elasticity of the ROI was lower (7.68 ± 3.82 kPa; range, 3.41-15.40 kPa) compared to the malignant LNs (15.81 ± 10.61 kPa; range, 3.86-36.45 kPa).The most reproducible way to measure stiffness in inguinal LNs is a 3 mm circular ROI centered on the cortex of the LN in axial plane. Elasticity values were higher in the malignant LNs reflecting the stiffer nature of the metastatic LNs. 2D-SWE offers a noninvasive ultrasonographic tool to assess superficial inguinal lymph nodes with high reproducibility."
https://openalex.org/W4221037833,"Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients are known to lose muscle mass and function during ICU stay. Ultrasonography (US) application for the assessment of the skeletal muscle is a promising tool and might help detecting muscle changes and thus several dysfunctions during early stages of ICU stay. MUSiShock is a research project aiming to investigate structure and function of diaphragm and peripheral muscles using ultrasound techniques in septic shock patients, and to assess their relevance in several clinical outcomes such as the weaning process.This is a research protocol from an observational prospective cohort study. We plan to assess eighty-four septic shock patients during their ICU stay at the following time-points: at 24 hours of ICU admission, then daily until day 5, then weekly, at extubation time and at ICU discharge. At each time-point, we will measure the quadriceps rectus femoris and diaphragm muscles, using innovative US muscle markers such as Shear-Wave Elastography (SWE). In parallel, the Medical Research Council (MRC) sum score for muscle testing and the Airway occlusion pressure (P0.1) will also be collected. We will describe the association between SWE assessment and other US markers for each muscle. The association between the changes in both diaphragm and rectus femoris US markers over time will be explored as well; finally, the analysis of a combined model of one diaphragm US marker and one limb muscle US marker to predict weaning success/failure will be tested.By using muscle ultrasound at both diaphragm and limb levels, MUSiShock aims to improve knowledge in the early detection of muscle dysfunction and weakness, and their relationship with muscle strength and MV weaning, in critically ill patients. A better anticipation of these short-term muscle structure and function outcomes may allow clinicians to rapidly implement measures to counteract it.ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04550143.

https://openalex.org/W4220890420,"The successful integration of asylum seekers into the labor market is among the most pressing issues of refugee-receiving countries. We construe co-workers’ willingness to collaborate with asylum seekers as a crucial factor for integration and investigate its antecedents. Linking Allport’s contact theory with team diversity theories, we propose that a work team’s diversity affects team members’ willingness to collaborate with asylum seekers. We thus investigated the effects of different facets of objective (national, migration background, age, and gender) and perceived diversity in work teams on team members’ willingness to collaborate with asylum seekers. In doing so, we also tested whether asylum seekers’ status in the team hierarchy (superior vs. colleague), task interdependence, and pro-diversity team norms moderate these effects. Multi-level regression analyses based on 470 participants nested in 106 teams showed that, overall, team diversity played a small role in explaining the willingness to collaborate with asylum seekers. Age diversity was negatively associated with the willingness to collaborate with asylum seekers, especially when asylum seekers were considered to take a post as a superior rather than a colleague. In teams with high task interdependence, migration background diversity and willingness to collaborate with asylum seekers were positively associated. Pro-diversity norms did not moderate team diversity effects. Overall, our findings demonstrate that team diversity can have beneficial, harmful, and no substantial consequences for the willingness to work with asylum seekers, depending on the considered type of diversity and boundary conditions."

In this regard, multiple sequence alignment of 17271 Indian SARS-CoV-2 sequences is performed using MAFFT followed by their phylogenetic analysis using Nextstrain. Subsequently, mutation points as SNPs are identified by Nextstrain. Thereafter, from the aligned sequences temporal and spatial analysis are carried out to identify top 10 hotspot mutations in the coding regions based on entropy. Finally, to judge the functional characteristics of all the non-synonymous hotspot mutations, their changes in proteins are evaluated as biological functions considering the sequences by using PolyPhen-2 while I-Mutant 2.0 evaluates their structural stability. For both temporal and spatial analysis, there are 21 non-synonymous hotspot mutations which are unstable and damaging."
https://openalex.org/W4229365632,"Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC; EC 4.1.1.17) catalyzes the conversion of ornithine to putrescine, the rate-limiting first step for de novo polyamine biosynthesis. Previously, we reported that genetic knockdown of xanthine dehydrogenase 1 (XDH1)—a gene encoding the enzyme involved in the last two steps of uric acid synthesis—causes an increase in ODC transcript levels in fat body of blood-fed Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, suggesting a crosstalk at molecular level between XDH1 and ODC during nitrogen disposal. To further investigate the role of ODC in nitrogen metabolism, we conducted several biochemical and genetic analyses in sugar- and blood-fed A. aegypti females. Distinct ODC gene and protein expression patterns were observed in mosquito tissues dissected during the first gonotrophic cycle. Both pharmacological and RNA interference-mediated knockdown of ODC negatively impacted mosquito survival, disrupted nitrogen waste disposal, delayed oviposition onset, and decreased fecundity in vitellogenic blood-fed females. A lag in the expression of two major digestive serine proteases, a reduction of blood meal digestion in the midgut, and a decrease in vitellogenin yolk protein uptake in ovarian follicles were observed by western blots in ODC-deficient females. Moreover, genetic silencing of ODC showed a broad transcriptional modulation of genes encoding proteins involved in multiple metabolic pathways in mosquito fat body, midgut, and Malpighian tubules prior to and after blood feeding. All together, these data demonstrate that ODC plays an essential role in mosquito metabolism, and that ODC crosstalks with multiple genes and proteins to prevent deadly nitrogen perturbations in A. aegypti females."
