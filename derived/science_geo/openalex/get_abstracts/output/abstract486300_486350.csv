It is characterized by accumulation of an excessive amount of extracellular matrix molecules that primarily include collagen type I. IL-6 is a profibrotic cytokine that is elevated in the prototypic fibrotic autoimmune condition systemic sclerosis and is known to induce collagen I expression, but the mechanism(s) behind this induction are currently unknown. Using healthy dermal fibroblasts in vitro, we analyzed the signaling pathways that underscore the IL-6-mediated induction of collagen. We show that IL-6 trans signaling is important and that the effect is dependent on STAT3; however, the effect is indirect and mediated through enhanced TGF-β signaling and the classic downstream cellular mediator Smad3. This is due to induction of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) antagonist Gremlin-1, and we show that Gremlin-1 is profibrotic and is mediated through canonical TGF-β signaling.

Fibrosis is characterized by excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix components that include primarily collagen type I. Tissue fibrosis results from excessive scarring that ultimately leads to loss of tissue function through destruction of tissue architecture. Fibrosis is a critical component of many diseases including liver fibrosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, myelofibrosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic sclerosis. Fibrosis may be the final common outcome of many autoimmune diseases, and fibrotic disease is estimated to contribute up to 45% of all deaths in the Western world; there is therefore a need for therapeutics. Systemic sclerosis is a prototypical fibrotic disease that is characterized by activation of the immune system, autoimmunity, vasculopathy, chronic inflammation, and ultimately fibrosis (1.Bhattacharyya S. Wei J. Varga J. Understanding fibrosis in systemic sclerosis: shifting paradigms, emerging opportunities.Nat. Rev. Rheumatol. 2012; 8: 42-54Crossref Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The cause of the disease is unknown, and there is currently no accepted treatment. However, there is now a consensus that there is an interplay between the innate and adaptive immune system that leads to differentiation of resident fibroblasts to “myofibroblasts” and the excessive deposition of extracellular matrix, primarily collagen I. Although the effector cell is the activated myofibroblast, the interplay between the immune system (innate and adaptive) and secreted profibrotic factors appears important in the pathogenesis of the disease (2.O'Reilly S. Hügle T. van Laar J.M. T cells in systemic sclerosis: a reappraisal.Rheumatology. 2012; 51: 1540-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The observation of perivascular infiltrates of leukocytes at sites of fibrosis early in the disease course points to an important role of leukocytes in disease pathogenesis (3.Kräling B.M. Maul G.G. Jimenez S.A. Mononuclear cellular infiltrates in clinically involved skin from patients with systemic sclerosis of recent onset predominantly consist of monocytes/macrophages.Pathobiology. 1995; 63: 48-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a classic proinflammatory cytokine but is also pleiotropic. IL-6 is produced by a wide variety of cells including monocytes/macrophages, T cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and hepatocytes. This cytokine is critical in many infectious disease situations and regulates a variety of cell functions such as cell proliferation, activation, and differentiation.

Blockade of IL-6 signaling via an anti-IL-6R antibody in sclerodermatous chronic graft versus host disease, which mimics SSc, attenuated the disease and subsequent fibrosis and increased beneficial T regulatory cells (7.Le Huu D.

The cytokine binds to its receptor IL-6R and also utilizes a common receptor, glycoprotein 130, to initiate intracellular signaling. The common cytokine receptor gp130 is shared with IL-6, Oncostatin M (OSM), IL-11, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1), cardiotrophin-like cytokine, and ciliary neutrophilic factor (CNTF), which are a family of pleiotropic cytokines (8.Pennica D.

Mice lacking the CNTF receptor, unlike mice lacking CNTF, exhibit profound motor neuron deficits at birth.Cell. 1995; 83: 313-322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Although the common co-receptor gp130 is ubiquitously expressed, IL-6R is highly restricted in its expression pattern (10.Jones S.A. Horiuchi S. Topley N. Yamamoto N. Fuller G.M. The soluble interleukin 6 receptor: mechanisms of production and implications in disease.FASEB J. 2001; 15: 43-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). IL-6R is mainly expressed by hepatocytes and a subset of T cells. This limits the repertoire of cells that are able to respond to IL-6 signaling. However, trans signaling increases the number of cells that can respond to IL-6 by the binding of soluble IL-6R, shed from cells via a sheddase, and IL-6 to gp130 to initiate signaling (10.Jones S.A. Horiuchi S. Topley N. Yamamoto N. Fuller G.M.

Hügle T. van Laar J.M. Interleukin-6, its role in fibrosing conditions.Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2012; 23: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Thus cells that do not express the membrane-bound IL-6R can now respond in association with soluble IL-6R and IL-6, forming a complex. Once signaling is initiated, receptor-associated Janus kinases (JAKs) are activated, and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) transcription factors are phosphorylated and translocate to the cell nucleus to coordinate gene expression by binding to STAT-responsive gene elements (12.Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Haan S. Hermanns H.M. Müller-Newen G. Schaper F. Principles of interleukin (IL)-6-type cytokine signalling and its regulation.Biochem.

Immunol. 2013; 2: e4Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These JAKs do not possess tyrosine kinase activity themselves. The JAKs consist of JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TyK2. ERK can also be activated in response to IL-6 (12.Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Haan S. Hermanns H.M. Müller-Newen G. Schaper F. Principles of interleukin (IL)-6-type cytokine signalling and its regulation.Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (2511) Google Scholar). Multiple JAK inhibitors are now in clinical trials to test their effects in rheumatoid arthritis. Indeed gain of function mutations in JAK2 underlie myelofibrosis and give a rationale for targeting JAK therapeutically. Although IL-6 trans signaling is known to cause fibrosis, the underlying molecular mechanism is unknown. In a mouse model of fibrosis, it was shown that hyperactivation of STAT3 enhanced fibrosis (14.O'Donoghue R.J. Knight D.A. Richards C.D. Prêle C.M. Lau H.L. Jarnicki A.G. Jones J. Bozinovski S. Vlahos R. Thiem S. McKenzie B.S. Wang B. Stumbles P. Laurent G.J. McAnulty R.J. Rose-John S. Zhu H.J. Anderson G.P. Ernst M.R. Mutsaers S.E. Genetic partitioning of interleukin-6 signalling in mice dissociates Stat3 from Smad3-mediated lung fibrosis.EMBO Mol. Med. 2012; 4: 939-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), and excessive activation of STAT3 was found in the lung tissue of patients with idiopathic lung fibrosis. Consistent with a role of STAT3 in mediating fibrosis, keloid fibroblasts have excessive IL-6 secretion and respond to IL-6 stimulation with up-regulation of collagen transcription (15.Ghazizadeh M. Tosa M. Shimizu H. Hyakusoku H. Kawanami O. Functional implications of the IL-6 signaling pathway in keloid pathogenesis.J. Invest. Dermatol. 2007; 127: 98-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Furthermore genetic deletion of IL-6 results in reduced fibrosis in animal models of lung fibrosis (16.Saito F. Tasaka S. Inoue K. Miyamoto K. Nakano Y. Ogawa Y. Yamada W. Shiraishi Y. Hasegawa N. Fujishima S. Takano H. Ishizaka A. Role of interleukin-6 in bleomycin-induced lung inflammatory changes in mice.Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2008; 38: 566-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Indeed SSc dermal fibroblasts cultured from lesional skin of patients have elevated phosphorylated STAT3, which stays elevated in culture (17.Dees C. Tomcik M. Palumbo-Zerr K. Distler A. Beyer C. Lang V. Horn A. Zerr P. Zwerina J. Gelse K. Distler O. Schett G. Distler J.H. JAK-2 as a novel mediator of the profibrotic effects of transforming growth factor β in systemic sclerosis.Arthritis Rheum. 2012; 64: 3006-3015Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and blockade of JAK2, which lies upstream of STAT3, reduced collagen levels in these cells and also in the bleomycin model of fibrosis (17.Dees C. Tomcik M. Palumbo-Zerr K. Distler A. Beyer C. Lang V. Horn A. Zerr P. Zwerina J. Gelse K. Distler O. Schett G. Distler J.H. JAK-2 as a novel mediator of the profibrotic effects of transforming growth factor β in systemic sclerosis.Arthritis Rheum. 2012; 64: 3006-3015Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), suggesting that JAKs play a critical role in fibrosis. Further evidence comes from the finding that hypertrophic scars from burn patients have elevated phosphorylated STAT3 levels in in situ tissue sections and also in isolated cultured hypertrophic skin fibroblasts and that a STAT3 inhibitor attenuates both collagen I expression and proliferation genes such as c-Myc (18.Ray S. Ju X. Sun H. Finnerty C.C. Herndon D.N. Brasier A.R. The IL-6 trans-Signaling-STAT3 pathway mediates ECM and cellular proliferation in fibroblasts from hypertrophic scar.J. Invest. Dermatol. 2013; 133: 1212-1220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Thus STAT3 is important in regulating fibrosis-related genes; however, the precise molecular mechanism(s) remain to be determined. It is likely that molecular feedback loops are at play in driving the collagen deposition. To gain an understanding of the underlying molecular mechanism of IL-6 trans signaling in fibrosis, we used dermal fibroblasts to examine the role of the downstream signaling pathways utilized that lead to fibrosis. systemic sclerosis IL-6 receptor soluble IL-6R bone morphogenetic protein dimethyl sulfoxide. Dermal fibroblasts were cultured from punch biopsies taken from lesions of SSc patients (n = 3) or healthy controls undergoing breast reduction surgery. The dermal fibroblasts were isolated and cultured as described previously (19.Hügle T. O'Reilly S. Simpson R. Kraaij M.D. Bigley V. Collin M. Krippner-Heidenreich A. van Laar J.M. Tumor necrosis factor-costimulated T lymphocytes from patients with systemic sclerosis trigger collagen production in fibroblasts.Arthritis Rheum. 2013; 65: 481-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Local ethical approval was granted for this study. Cells were maintained in RPMI medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated serum, l-glutamine, and penicillin and streptomycin in 75-cm3 tissue culture flasks until seeding. JAK kinase inhibitor Ruxolitinib was purchased from Calbiochem, and STAT1 inhibitor Fludarabine was purchased from Selleckchem. The MAPK inhibitors U0126 and SB202190 were both purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. The TGF-β receptor (TGF-βR) inhibitor SB431542 was purchased from Tocris and reconstituted in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). All recombinant proteins were purchased from R&D Systems (IL-6, sIL-6R, IL-10, and Gremlin-1). The endotoxin levels were determined to be <0.01 ng/μl. Recombinant proteins were also boiled and incubated to check for contamination. After the appropriate treatments, RNA was isolated using TRIzol according to the manufacturer's instructions. 1 μg of RNA was DNase-treated and reverse-transcribed using reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). cDNA was then analyzed using specific primers (Collagen1A1 forward 5′-CAA GAG GAA GGC CAA GTC GAG G-3′, reverse 5′-CGT TGT CGC AGA CGC AGA T-3′; Gremlin-1 gene forward 5′-TAT GAG CCG CAC AGC CTA CA-3′, reverse 5′-GCA CCT TGG GAC CCT TTC TT-3′; and ribosomal 18 S forward 5′-CGA ATG GCT CAT TAA ATC AGT TAT GG-3′, reverse 5′-TAT TAG CTC TAG AAT TAC CAC AGT TAT CC-3′) using SYBR Green technology. Relative levels were normalized to 18 S, and -fold change was calculated using the ΔCt method. After the appropriate treatment, cells were washed twice with cold PBS and then lysed in Laemmli buffer and separated on a 10% SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The proteins were then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane for 1 h at 120 V, after which the membrane was blocked in 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h and the primary antibody was incubated overnight at 4 °C. Blots were then washed in TBS/Tween and incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody labeled with HRP, and then the bands visualized with chemiluminescent substrate (ECL Plus, GE Healthcare) and exposed on film (Kodak). Antibodies used were: 1:1200 phospho-Smad3 (Abcam), 1:1000 Smad3 (Abcam) phospho-p38 (Cell Signaling), 1:800 TGF-β receptor (Cell Signaling), and 1:100,000 glyceraldehyde-3 phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (Abcam). GAPDH was used to confirm equal loading. For the siRNA silencing experiments cells were seeded into 24-well plates, and at 50–60% confluence 100 nm Smad3 siRNA SMARTpool (Dharmacon) 100 nm or nontargeting control siRNA was transfected using DharmaFECT 1 in antibiotic and serum-free medium. Following 24 h of transfection, medium was replaced with IL-6 + sIL-6R, and after a further 24 h, the cells were harvested. For Gremlin-1 siRNA silencing, the cells were seeded, and 100 nm specific Gremlin-1 siRNA SMARTpool or 100 nm nontargeting siRNA was transfected using Dhamafect1. After 24 h, medium was replaced with nothing or IL-6 + sIL-6R; following 24 h of incubation, cells were harvested. In diseased SSc fibroblasts, cells were seeded from three donors and transfected with Gremlin-1 or nontargeting control; after 24 h, cells were harvested. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism software, and one-way analysis of variance or Student's t test was applied. Data presented are the means ± S.E. For all analyses a p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. We and others had previously demonstrated that incubation with IL-6 and sIL-6R leads to Collagen1A1 expression in healthy dermal fibroblasts in vitro (19.Hügle T. O'Reilly S. Simpson R. Kraaij M.D. Bigley V. Collin M. Krippner-Heidenreich A. van Laar J.M. Tumor necrosis factor-costimulated T lymphocytes from patients with systemic sclerosis trigger collagen production in fibroblasts.Arthritis Rheum. 2013; 65: 481-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 20.Khan K. Xu S. Nihtyanova S. Derrett-Smith E. Abraham D. Denton C.P. Ong V.H. Clinical and pathological significance of interleukin 6 overexpression in systemic sclerosis.Ann. Rheum. Dis. 2012; 71: 1235-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). We tested the hypothesis that chemical blockade of JAK 1 using the clinical JAK inhibitor Ruxolitinib would reduce IL-6 trans signaling-induced collagen induction downstream of receptor engagement. Indeed incubation with IL-6 or sIL-6R alone did not affect collagen I expression in dermal fibroblasts; however, incubation with both IL-6 and sIL-6R led to an increased expression of collagen I 6.83-fold, and preincubation with Ruxolitinib attenuated this induction of collagen down to 2.98-fold as compared with control (p = 0.001). Ruxolitinib alone was changed by 1.23-fold as compared with control (Fig. 1A). Because IL-6 can also activate STAT1 to a lesser degree than STAT3, we examined the role of STAT1 in collagen induction by pharmacological blockade of STAT1 with Fludarabine. Fludarabine is a potent and specific STAT1 inhibitor (21.Frank D.A. Mahajan S. Ritz J. Fludarabine-induced immunosuppression is associated with inhibition of STAT1 signaling.Nat Med. 1999; 5: 444-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and is used as an antileukemia drug. Fig. 1B shows that IL-6 and sIL-6R induce collagen I expression but that pretreatment with Fludarabine does not reduce this increased expression. Thus IL-6-mediated collagen expression is independent of STAT1 activation. ERK has been reported to be affected by IL-6 incubation, and we therefore wanted to examine the role of ERK in IL-6 trans signaling induction of collagen I. Using the ERK inhibitor U0126 that targets the ERK pathway, we found that this did not attenuate the IL-6-mediated increase in Collagen1A1 induction (Fig. 1C). Because the collagen induction via IL-6 trans signaling appeared elevated after 24 h of stimulation, we performed a time course analysis to see whether this effect was mediated earlier. Time course analysis of collagen mRNA expression revealed that 24 h was the peak stimulation after IL-6 + sIL-6R and that after this time collagen decreased (Fig. 2A). Promoter analysis suggested that STAT3 does not have a binding site in the collagen promoter. Based on this we felt the effect was indirect. We examined whether phosphorylated Smad3 was phosphorylated using Western blotting. This revealed that only after 16 h of stimulation with IL-6 + sIL-6R were there significant phosphorylation levels in the dermal fibroblast (Fig. 2B). Because phosphorylated Smad 3 levels were only detectable after 16 h following IL-6 + sIL-6R stimulation, we examined the expression of TGF-β1. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to identify the mRNA for TGF-β1, and this was surprisingly found not to be significantly elevated (Fig. 3A) at the time points examined. Because the TGF-β1 levels were not elevated, we also examined the levels of the TGF-β receptor II in the dermal fibroblasts. Again there were no significant differences at both the transcriptional mRNA and the protein levels (Fig. 3, B and C). Because activation of Smad3 was occurring secondary to IL-6 trans signaling, we used SB431542 to inhibit TGF-β signaling via both TGF-β receptors. Pretreatment with SB431542 significantly reduced IL-6 + sIL-6R-induced collagen expression (p = <0.0001) (Fig. 4A). DMSO (0.01%) was used as a vehicle control; this had no effect on the cells. One of the downstream signaling pathways utilized by the canonical signaling pathway through which TGF-β operates is Smad3; this is an intracellular transcription factor that is phosphorylated and translocates into the nucleus to facilitate gene transcription. Using specific siRNA against total Smad3, it was shown that IL-6 + sIL-6R-induced collagen expression was significantly attenuated as compared with a nontargeting control siRNA after 24 h (Fig. 4B). Knockdown of Smad3 was highly efficient (Fig. 4C). Gremlin-1 is a BMP antagonist. Using specific siRNA directed against Gremlin-1, it was shown that the induction of collagen by IL-6 + sIL-6R was significantly diminished, but a nontargeting control siRNA did not reduce the induction of collagen (Fig. 5A). Treatment of cells with IL-6 + sIL-6R resulted in a significant increase in Gremlin-1 levels at 16 h following stimulation (Fig. 5B). Analysis of unstimulated SSc fibroblasts revealed a 3-fold increase as compared with healthy control cultures (p = 0.0478, Student's t test) (Fig. 5C). Because we could reduce collagen induction via Smad3 signaling inhibition and siRNA against the BMP antagonist Gremlin, we sought to determine whether direct addition of Gremlin induces collagen in dermal fibroblasts. Indeed incubation of 1 μg of recombinant Gremlin-1 led to a 5.3-fold increase of collagen as compared with untreated cultures (Fig. 6A). We also demonstrated that the addition of Gremlin induces robust phosphorylation of Smad3 after 1 h of incubation and that recombinant Gremlin also induced phospho-p38 at similar time points (Fig. 6B). Blockade of canonical TGF-β signaling with SB431542 significantly reduced Gremlin-induced collagen expression by IL-6 trans signaling (p = <0.001) (Fig. 6C). However, blockade with the p38 inhibitor SB202190 (10 μm) did not reduce the induction of collagen (Fig. 6D). siRNA-mediated silencing of Smad3 revealed that this is the main signaling molecule regulating Gremlin-1-mediated collagen (Fig. 6E). To confirm the specificity of IL-6 for the induction of Gremlin, we used another STAT3-inducing cytokine, IL-10, to determine the specificity. IL-10 did not induce Gremlin-1 expression at any time point analyzed and mirrored control levels (Fig. 7A). Because the SSc fibroblasts are autonomous and produce excessive collagen I in vitro and because we have demonstrated elevated levels of the novel cytokine Gremlin in these cells, we used siRNA against Gremlin-1 and examined the levels of collagen following knockdown. Fig. 7B demonstrates that silencing of Gremlin reduced collagen transcripts by 50% as compared with scrambled control siRNA (p = 0.01, Student's t test). IL-6 is described as a classic proinflammatory cytokine; however, it is also profibrotic, but the exact underlying mechanism is still undefined. Fibrotic diseases such as SSc are characterized by uncontrolled activation of fibroblasts that secrete huge quantities of extracellular matrix following inflammation. It is known that levels of IL-6 are elevated in SSc and that this correlates with skin score (20.Khan K. Xu S. Nihtyanova S. Derrett-Smith E. Abraham D. Denton C.P. Ong V.H. Clinical and pathological significance of interleukin 6 overexpression in systemic sclerosis.Ann. Rheum. Dis. 2012; 71: 1235-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In this study we demonstrated that IL-6 trans signaling leads to collagen increases through an indirect mechanism that is mediated through the BMP antagonist Gremlin-1, which reveals a novel pathway. Blockade of STAT3 reduced IL-6-induced collagen induction both in this study and in keloid fibroblasts in a previous study (22.Lim C.P. Phan T.T. Lim I.J. Cao X. Stat3 contributes to keloid pathogenesis via promoting collagen production, cell proliferation and migration.Oncogene. 2006; 25: 5416-5425Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, it is independent of STAT1. Moreover blockade of MAPK signaling with U0126 did not reduce collagen levels. This is not in accordance with Khan et al. (20.Khan K. Xu S. Nihtyanova S. Derrett-Smith E. Abraham D. Denton C.P. Ong V.H. Clinical and pathological significance of interleukin 6 overexpression in systemic sclerosis.Ann. Rheum. Dis. 2012; 71: 1235-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). We and others have reported that phospho-STAT3 is elevated in SSc dermal fibroblasts in culture and that they maintain this elevated constitutive STAT3 activation in serial passages (17.Dees C. Tomcik M. Palumbo-Zerr K. Distler A. Beyer C. Lang V. Horn A. Zerr P. Zwerina J. Gelse K. Distler O. Schett G. Distler J.H.

Hyperactivation of STAT3 in genetically modified mice in which they have “switched on” hyperactive STAT3 constantly shows that if you treat them with bleomycin, their lung fibrosis is exacerbated, thereby underscoring the role of IL-6 signaling in fibrosis (14.O'Donoghue R.J. Knight D.A. Richards C.D. Prêle C.M. Lau H.L. Jarnicki A.G. Jones J. Bozinovski S. Vlahos R. Thiem S. McKenzie B.S. Wang B. Stumbles P. Laurent G.J. McAnulty R.J. Rose-John S. Zhu H.J. Anderson G.P.

Med. 2012; 4: 939-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism for this is unknown. Furthermore, genetic deletion of SOCS3, the endogenous negative regulator of STAT3, exacerbates graft versus host disease, a model of SSc (23.Hill G.R. Kuns R.D. Raffelt N.C. Don A.L. Olver S.D. Markey K.A. Wilson Y.A. Tocker J. Alexander W.S. Clouston A.D. Roberts A.W. MacDonald K.P. SOCS3 regulates graft-versus-host disease.Blood. 2010; 116: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Because it had been reported that IL-6 can induce expression of TGF-β1 in liver cells (24.Ogata H. Chinen T. Yoshida T. Kinjyo I. Takaesu G. Shiraishi H. Iida M. Kobayashi T. Yoshimura A. Loss of SOCS3 in the liver promotes fibrosis by enhancing STAT3-mediated TGF-β1 production.Oncogene. 2006; 25: 2520-2530Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 25.Aoki H. Ohnishi H. Hama K.

Cell. Biochem. 2006; 99: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), at least at the mRNA level, we examined TGF-β1 expression after IL-6 stimulation. However, it appeared that TGF-β1 mRNA was not increased after IL-6 trans signaling. Therefore another mechanism other than IL-6-mediated TGF-β1 must be increasing the collagen expression. The time course of the induction of collagen expression was delayed, indicating that this was an indirect effect rather than a direct transcriptional activation of collagen. Furthermore there was a delayed phosphorylation of Smad3, a critical downstream mediator of fibrosis. Once Smad3 is phosphorylated, it dimerizes with Smad4 and then shuttles to the nucleus to regulate gene expression. Gremlin-1 is a BMP antagonist and contains a highly conserved cysteine-rich domain and is a member of the TGF-β superfamily of cystine knot cytokines. Gremlin-1 has been found to predict adverse outcome in heart failure, is highly correlated to myocardial fibrosis grade (26.Mueller K.A. Tavlaki E. Schneider M. Jorbenadze R. Geisler T. Kandolf R. Gawaz M. Mueller I.I. Zuern C.S. Gremlin-1 identifies fibrosis and predicts adverse outcome in patients with heart failure undergoing endomyocardial biopsy.J. Card.

Gremlin-1 is an antagonist of BMPs including BMP4 and BMP7, and BMP7 is the antagonist of TGF-β1 signaling and has been found to inhibit TGF-β1-induced renal fibrosis in the kidney (29.Zeisberg M.

Sci. 2007; 48: 715-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Gremlin has also been suggested to be a specific marker of activated stellate cells by transcriptome analysis (31.Boers W. Aarrass S. Linthorst C. Pinzani M. Elferink R.O. Bosma P. Transcriptional profiling reveals novel markers of liver fibrogenesis: Gremlin and insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16289-16295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Also overexpression of Gremlin has been found to inhibit BMP4, thus leading to enhanced TGF-β signaling and extracellular matrix deposition in primary open angle glaucoma (32.Wordinger R.J. Fleenor D.L. Hellberg P.E. Pang I.H. Tovar T.O. Zode G.S. Fuller J.A. Clark A.F. Effects of TGF-β2, BMP-4, and Gremlin in the trabecular meshwork: implications for glaucoma.Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2007; 48: 1191-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). However, a non-BMP-dependent role has recently come to light. A recent study found that Gremlin can bind the VEGF receptor2 to induce angiogenesis (33.Mitola S. Ravelli C. Moroni E. Salvi V. Leali D. Ballmer-Hofer K. Zammataro L. Presta M. Gremlin is a novel agonist of the major proangiogenic receptor VEGFR2.Blood. 2010; 116: 3677-3680Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar); it likely that Gremlin utilizes other pathways. We have found a non-BMP-dependent pathway of Gremlin in dermal fibroblasts. We demonstrated that siRNA-mediated knockdown of Gremlin-1 resulted in reductions of IL-6 trans signaling-induced collagen expression. We further show that IL-6 induces Gremlin and that SSc dermal fibroblasts have elevated constitutive levels of Gremlin. Gremlin utilizes the TGF-β signaling pathway and is dependent on Smad3 for its action but not p38. Although phosphorylation of p38 occurred, this pathway appears to play no role in the induction of collagen. Therefore Gremlin utilizes only the canonical signaling pathway of TGF-β. Reactivation of developmental genes may occur in fibrotic diseases similar to cancer. Only one study on the bleomycin model of fibrosis (a mimic of SSc) has shown altered levels of Gremlin in a gene arrays analysis, so this represents an important finding. Importantly in SSc fibroblasts siRNA-mediated reduction of Gremlin reduced collagen by over 50%. Also of note is the fact that Gremlin is additionally associated with the development of pulmonary hypertension and haplodeficiency in a mouse model that augments hypertension and vascular remodeling (34.Cahill E. Costello C.M. Rowan S.C. Harkin S. Howell K. Leonard M.O. Southwood M. Cummins E.P. Fitzpatrick S.F. Taylor C.T. Morrell N.W. Martin F. McLoughlin P. Gremlin plays a key role in the pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension.Circulation. 2012; 125: 920-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This is important as many SSc patients also develop pulmonary hypertension, which carries a high mortality rate. Thus targeting Gremlin may be beneficial on two fronts: first, the modulation of fibrogenesis, and second, the augmentation of pulmonary hypertension. Moreover haplodeficiency of Gremlin also reduces diabetic nephropathy and associated damage markers and the fibrotic protein connective tissue growth factor (35.Roxburgh S.A. Kattla J.J. Curran S.P. O'Meara Y.M. Pollock C.A. Goldschmeding R. Godson C. Martin F. Brazil D.P. Allelic depletion of grem1 attenuates diabetic kidney disease.Diabetes. 2009; 58: 1641-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To confirm that the modulation of Gremlin levels by STAT3 was IL-6-specific, we used another STAT3 utilizing cytokine IL-10. We found over the time course that IL-10 could not induce Gremlin levels (or collagen). Therefore the profibrotic nature of STAT3 activation is cytokine-specific, although both cytokines use STAT3 downstream of receptor engagement. Thus although different cytokines may utilize the same STAT3 transcription factor, the ultimate response is different. In conclusion IL-6 trans signaling leads to activation of STAT3 via phosphorylation translocation to the nucleus and activation of target genes, and Gremlin is induced and activates the canonical TGF-β signaling cascade via Smad3 activation that leads to collagen expression in an autocrine loop. It is of interest that a major pharmaceutical company have a therapeutic antibody directed against Gremlin-1, which may be a possible therapeutic in SSc. This may be more specific than general JAK inhibition, which has been shown to be effective in an animal model of SSc (17.Dees C. Tomcik M. Palumbo-Zerr K. Distler A. Beyer C. Lang V. Horn A. Zerr P. Zwerina J. Gelse K. Distler O. Schett G. Distler J.H.

https://openalex.org/W2067571825,"This study was designed to examine the role of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in the generation of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL)-stimulated monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) from macrophages and possible mechanisms. THP-1 cells and RAW macrophages were pretreated with sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) and hexyl acrylate and then treated with ox-LDL. The results showed that ox-LDL treatment down-regulated the H2S/cystathionine-β-synthase pathway, with increased MCP-1 protein and mRNA expression in both THP-1 cells and RAW macrophages. Hexyl acrylate promoted ox-LDL-induced inflammation, whereas the H2S donor NaHS inhibited it. NaHS markedly suppressed NF-κB p65 phosphorylation, nuclear translocation, DNA binding activity, and recruitment to the MCP-1 promoter in ox-LDL-treated macrophages. Furthermore, NaHS decreased the ratio of free thiol groups in p65, whereas the thiol reductant DTT reversed the inhibiting effect of H2S on the p65 DNA binding activity. Most importantly, site-specific mutation of cysteine 38 to serine in p65 abolished the effect of H2S on the sulfhydration of NF-κB and ox-LDL-induced NF-κB activation. These results suggested that endogenous H2S inhibited ox-LDL-induced macrophage inflammation by suppressing NF-κB p65 phosphorylation, nuclear translocation, DNA binding activity, and recruitment to the MCP-1 promoter. The sulfhydration of free thiol group on cysteine 38 in p65 served as a molecular mechanism by which H2S inhibited NF-κB pathway activation in ox-LDL-induced macrophage inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2092485542,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are pluripotent cells that can differentiate into multilineage cell types, including adipocytes and osteoblasts. Mechanical stimulus is one of the crucial factors in regulating MSC differentiation. However, it remains unknown how mechanical stimulus affects the balance between adipogenesis and osteogenesis. Low intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) therapy is a clinical application of mechanical stimulus and facilitates bone fracture healing. Here, we applied LIPUS to adipogenic progenitor cell and MSC lines to analyze how multilineage cell differentiation was affected. We found that LIPUS suppressed adipogenic differentiation of both cell types, represented by impaired lipid droplet appearance and decreased gene expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ2 (Pparg2) and fatty acid-binding protein 4 (Fabp4). LIPUS also down-regulated the phosphorylation level of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ2 protein, inhibiting its transcriptional activity. In contrast, LIPUS promoted osteogenic differentiation of the MSC line, characterized by increased cell calcification as well as inductions of runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) and Osteocalcin mRNAs. LIPUS induced phosphorylation of cancer Osaka thyroid oncogene/tumor progression locus 2 (Cot/Tpl2) kinase, which was essential for the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated kinase kinase 1 (MEK1) and p44/p42 extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs). Notably, effects of LIPUS on both adipogenesis and osteogenesis were prevented by a Cot/Tpl2-specific inhibitor. Furthermore, effects of LIPUS on MSC differentiation as well as Cot/Tpl2 phosphorylation were attenuated by the inhibition of Rho-associated kinase. Taken together, these results indicate that mechanical stimulus with LIPUS suppresses adipogenesis and promotes osteogenesis of MSCs through Rho-associated kinase-Cot/Tpl2-MEK-ERK signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2062588841,"We have used an in vitro model system to probe the iron transport pathway across the brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMVEC) of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). This model consists of human BMVEC (hBMVEC) and C6 glioma cells (as an astrocytic cell line) grown in a transwell, a cell culture system commonly used to quantify metabolite flux across a cell-derived barrier. We found that iron efflux from hBMVEC through the ferrous iron permease ferroportin (Fpn) was stimulated by secretion of the soluble form of the multi-copper ferroxidase, ceruloplasmin (sCp) from the co-cultured C6 cells. Reciprocally, expression of sCp mRNA in the C6 cells was increased by neighboring hBMVEC. In addition, data indicate that C6 cell-secreted hepcidin stimulates internalization of hBMVEC Fpn but only when the end-feet projections characteristic of this glia-derived cell line are proximal to the endothelial cells. This hepcidin-dependent loss of Fpn correlated with knock-down of iron efflux from the hBMVEC; this result was consistent with the mechanism by which hepcidin regulates iron efflux in mammalian cells. In summary, the data support a model of iron trafficking across the BBB in which the capillary endothelium induce the underlying astrocytes to produce the ferroxidase activity needed to support Fpn-mediated iron efflux. Reciprocally, astrocyte proximity modulates the effective concentration of hepcidin at the endothelial cell membrane and thus the surface expression of hBMVEC Fpn. These results are independent of the source of hBMVEC iron (transferrin or non-transferrin bound) indicating that the model developed here is broadly applicable to brain iron homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W1971294322,"WW domains are small modules present in regulatory and signaling proteins that mediate specific protein-protein interactions. The WW domain-containing oxidoreductase (WWOX) encodes a 46-kDa tumor suppressor that contains two N-terminal WW domains and a central short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase domain. Based on its ligand recognition motifs, the WW domain family is classified into four groups. The largest one, to which WWOX belongs, recognizes ligands with a PPXY motif. To pursue the functional properties of the WW domains of WWOX, we employed mass spectrometry and phage display experiments to identify putative WWOX-interacting partners. Our analysis revealed that the first WW (WW1) domain of WWOX is the main functional interacting domain. Furthermore, our study uncovered well known and new PPXY-WW1-interacting partners and shed light on novel LPXY-WW1-interacting partners of WWOX. Many of these proteins are components of multiprotein complexes involved in molecular processes, including transcription, RNA processing, tight junction, and metabolism. By utilizing GST pull-down and immunoprecipitation assays, we validated that WWOX is a substrate of the E3 ubiquitin ligase ITCH, which contains two LPXY motifs. We found that ITCH mediates Lys-63-linked polyubiquitination of WWOX, leading to its nuclear localization and increased cell death. Our data suggest that the WW1 domain of WWOX provides a versatile platform that links WWOX with individual proteins associated with physiologically important networks."

Here, we found that the embryonic (e) CSF contains 1012 nanoparticles/ml (77 nm diameter), some of which were identified as exosome nanovesicles that contain evolutionarily conserved molecules important for coordinating intracellular pathways. eCSF nanovesicles collected from rodent and human embryos encapsulate protein and microRNA components of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling pathway. Supplementation of eCSF nanovesicles to a mixed culture containing eNSCs activated the IGF-mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway in eNSCs and expanded the pool of proliferative eNSCs.

We hypothesized that PRR contributes to podocyte injury via activation of Wnt-β-catenin-snail signaling pathway. Mouse podocytes were cultured in normal (5 mM) or high (25 mM) D-glucose for 3 days. Compared to normal glucose, high glucose significantly decreased mRNA and protein expressions of podocin and nephrin, and increased mRNA and protein expressions of PRR, Wnt3a, β-catenin, and snail, respectively. Confocal microscopy studies showed significant reduction in expression and reorganization of podocyte cytoskeleton protein, F-actin, in response to high glucose. Transwell functional permeability studies demonstrated significant increase in albumin flux through podocytes monolayer with high glucose. Cells treated with high glucose and PRR siRNA demonstrated significantly attenuated mRNA and protein expressions of PRR, Wnt3a, β-catenin, and snail; enhanced expressions of podocin mRNA and protein, improved expression and reorganization of F-actin, and reduced transwell albumin flux. We conclude that high glucose induces podocyte injury via PRR-Wnt- β-catenin- snail signaling pathway."

To clarify the roles of milk RNAs, further studies using experimental animals such as rats are needed. However, it is unclear whether rat milk also contains functional RNAs and what their time dependent expression profiles are. Thus, we prepared total RNA from whey isolated from rat milk collected on days 2, 9, and 16 postpartum and analyzed using microarrays and quantitative PCR. The concentration of RNA in colostrum whey (day 2) was markedly higher than that in mature milk whey (days 9 and 16). Microarray analysis detected 161 miRNAs and 10,948 mRNA transcripts. Most of the miRNAs and mRNA transcripts were common to all tested milks. Finally, we selected some immune- and development-related miRNAs and mRNAs, and analysed them by quantitative PCR (in equal sample volumes) to determine their time-dependent changes in expression in detail. Some were significantly more highly expressed in colostrum whey than in mature milk whey, but some were expressed equally. And mRNA expression levels of some cytokines and hormones did not reflect the protein levels. It is still unknown whether RNAs in milk play biological roles in neonates.

https://openalex.org/W2080831030,"Dose addition, a commonly used concept in toxicology for the prediction of chemical mixture effects, cannot readily be applied to mixtures of partial agonists with differing maximal effects. Due to its mathematical features, effect levels that exceed the maximal effect of the least efficacious compound present in the mixture, cannot be calculated. This poses problems when dealing with mixtures likely to be encountered in realistic assessment situations where chemicals often show differing maximal effects. To overcome this limitation, we developed a pragmatic solution that extrapolates the toxic units of partial agonists to effect levels beyond their maximal efficacy. We extrapolated different additivity expectations that reflect theoretically possible extremes and validated this approach with a mixture of 21 estrogenic chemicals in the E-Screen. This assay measures the proliferation of human epithelial breast cancers. We found that the dose-response curves of the estrogenic agents exhibited widely varying shapes, slopes and maximal effects, which made it necessary to extrapolate mixture responses above 14% proliferation. Our toxic unit extrapolation approach predicted all mixture responses accurately. It extends the applicability of dose addition to combinations of agents with differing saturating effects and removes an important bottleneck that has severely hampered the use of dose addition in the past."

The monomeric precursor of elastin, tropoelastin, as well as polypeptides containing smaller subsets of the tropoelastin sequence, can self-assemble through a colloidal phase separation process called coacervation. Present understanding suggests that self-assembly is promoted by association of hydrophobic domains contained within the tropoelastin sequence, whereas polymerization is achieved by covalent joining of lysine side chains within distinct alanine-rich, α-helical cross-linking domains. In this study, model elastin polypeptides were used to determine the structure of cross-linking domains during the assembly process and the effect of sequence alterations in these domains on assembly and structure. CD temperature melts indicated that partial α-helical structure in cross-linking domains at lower temperatures was absent at physiological temperature. Solid-state NMR demonstrated that β-strand structure of the cross-linking domains dominated in the coacervate state, although α-helix was predominant after subsequent cross-linking of lysine side chains with genipin. Mutation of lysine residues to hydrophobic amino acids, tyrosine or alanine, leads to increased propensity for β-structure and the formation of amyloid-like fibrils, characterized by thioflavin-T binding and transmission electron microscopy.

Elastin is the principal structural protein providing extensibility and elastic recoil to vertebrate tissues that are subject to repetitive mechanical stress, such as those found in the large blood vessels, skin, and lung. The elastin monomer, tropoelastin, is synthesized in the cell and transported to the extracellular matrix where, in association with other matrix proteins, it is assembled into a cross-linked polymeric material (1.Kielty C.M.

To this point, very little is known about the detailed structure of tropoelastin or elastin-like polypeptides in the coacervate form. Coacervates from both full-length tropoelastin and smaller elastin-like polypeptides can be cross-linked using cross-linkers that react with amino groups of lysine side chains. The resulting insoluble materials have elastic properties comparable with those of native polymeric elastin (22.Bellingham C.M. Lillie M.A. Gosline J.M. Wright G.M. Starcher B.C. Bailey A.J.

Sequence and domain arrangements influence mechanical properties of elastin-like polymeric elastomers.Biopolymers. 2013; 99: 392-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This finding, along with the ability of coacervate droplets to self-organize into extended network structures, suggests that the basic information needed for elastin assembly and elastomeric properties is provided by sequence motifs in the primary amino acid sequence of tropoelastin. As a result, we and others have attempted to determine the special properties specific to the sequence of tropoelastin that promote self-assembly into an elastic network and that differentiate it from other types of ordered aggregation such as amyloid formation. Although isolated hydrophobic domains and synthetic polypeptides consisting only of tandem repeats mimicking hydrophobic domain sequences will undergo coacervation, cross-linking domains do not coacervate on their own (19.Bellingham C.M. Woodhouse K.A. Robson P. Rothstein S.J. Keeley F.W. Self-aggregation characteristics of recombinantly expressed human elastin polypeptides.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1550: 6-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). As a result, the current model for elastin assembly considers the cross-linking domains as relatively passive participants in the process, maintaining α-helical structure throughout assembly from monomer to coacervate to cross-linked polymer. However, formation of lysine-derived cross-links by these KA-type cross-linking domains is strongly conserved in elastins across vertebrate phylogeny (32.He D. Chung M. Chan E. Alleyne T. Ha K.C.

Mecham R.P. Keeley F. Evolution of the Extracellular Matrix. Springer-Verlag, Berlin2013: 71-119Google Scholar), suggesting these sequences provide particular advantages to assembly. Furthermore, although they do not coacervate on their own, we and others have shown that the sequence and arrangements of the cross-linking domains within elastin-like polypeptides can have a dramatic effect on their coacervation characteristics (17.Miao M. Cirulis J.T. Lee S. Keeley F.W.

Despite the general acceptance of the α-helical character of KA-type cross-linking domains, the stability of these helices has been questioned. Observed helical content, measured by CD or NMR, is consistently lower than would be expected for fully formed helical structures (4.Tamburro A.M. Bochicchio B. Pepe A.

In this study, we use simple elastin-like polypeptides to investigate the effect of sequence and environment on the detailed structure of KA-type cross-linking domains. We demonstrate that the structures of these domains have a significant but previously unrecognized dependence on sequence and that they undergo major structural transitions during the process of self-assembly. A PCR-amplified DNA fragment consisting of exons 20, 21, 23, and 24 of human tropoelastin was cloned into the BamHI-EcoRI restriction sites of the T7 expression vector pET-32b (Invitrogen). This corresponds to the native sequence of human tropoelastin because exon 22, although present in the genomic sequence, is not expressed. Site-directed mutations were created by engineering reverse or forward primers containing the mutation of interest and amplifying a short fragment of exons 20–24. These fragments were purified on agarose gels and used as primers for a subsequent PCR with an additional forward or reverse primer to amplify the entire exon 20–24 sequence containing the mutation or mutations of interest. The product was cloned into the pET-32b vector as described above. The pET-32b expression constructs were used to transform BL21(DE3) competent cells. For unlabeled expression, transformants were grown at 37 °C with shaking in 1 liter of terrific broth liquid media supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 2% glucose as the carbon source. Isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 100 μm to induce expression at an A600 >1. Cultures were grown for an additional 3.5 h. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation. For isotopic spin label enrichment, cells were grown in standard M9 minimal medium supplemented with 0.2% [13C]glucose and [15N]NH4Cl as the carbon and nitrogen sources. Media were also supplemented with 13C-15N-labeled proline to a final concentration of 50 μg/ml. Isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside concentrations were reduced to 50 μm, and expression times were extended to 5 h in minimal medium. Cell pellets were dissolved in 20 ml of 70% formic acid containing 1 g of CNBr and incubated at room temperature for 16–24 h. The CNBr-treated cell solution was placed in dialysis tubing with a 3.5-kDa exclusion limit and dialyzed against 4 liters of 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.3, exchanging the buffer four times over a 48-h period. To collect the supernatant, the cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation for 15 min at 12,000 × g. The polypeptide of interest was further purified by ion exchange FPLC and a final step of C4 reverse phase HPLC as described previously (17.Miao M. Cirulis J.T. Lee S. Keeley F.W. Structural determinants of cross-linking and hydrophobic domains for self-assembly of elastin-like polypeptides.Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 14367-14375Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). MS was used to verify the expected molecular weights of the polypeptide products (Advanced Protein Technology Centre, The Hospital for Sick Children). The purified polypeptide was lyophilized and stored dry at room temperature. When dissolved in aqueous buffers, the polypeptide concentrations were determined by UV absorption at 215 and 225 nm (36.Waddell W.J. A simple ultraviolet spectrophotometric method for the determination of protein.J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1956; 48: 311-314PubMed Google Scholar). CD experiments were carried out using a Jasco J-810 spectrometer. CD scans were performed in a 1.0-mm cuvette dissolving elastin polypeptides to 10 μm in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0. The reported spectra are the mean of three stepwise scans between 260 and 190 nm, with signal averaged for at least 2 s at each wavelength. Thioflavin-T (ThT) fluorescence was monitored using an Aviv 105 spectrofluorometer with excitation and emission wavelengths of 450 and 482 nm, respectively. Fresh ThT was dissolved to a final concentration of 10 μm in all samples. As a positive control, Aβ(1–28) amyloid peptide was dissolved in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.0. All elastin polypeptides were dissolved in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0. Binding assays were carried out using a Molecular Devices SpectraMax Gemini EM microplate spectrofluorometer with excitation and emission wavelengths of 450 and 480 nm, respectively. Aliquots of 20 μl were taken daily from 200 μl of 50 μm polypeptide samples incubating at 37 °C and diluted to 5 μm in PBS, pH 7.4, containing a final concentration of 10 μm ThT. Coacervation was measured as a light scattering at 440 nm using a UV-2401PC spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Mandel Scientific) as described previously (30.Muiznieks L.D. Keeley F.W. Proline periodicity modulates the self-assembly properties of elastin-like polypeptides.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 39779-39789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Briefly, polypeptides were dissolved to 50 μm in PBS, pH 7.4, with additional NaCl to a final concentration of 1.5 m at a temperature ∼5–10 °C below the coacervation temperature. Solution temperature was then raised at a rate of 1 °C/min. Coacervation temperature was measured as the temperature of the initial upward inflection of the absorbance curve. Self-assembly of elastin polypeptides at a concentration of 50 μm was monitored in real time using a Zeiss Axiovert 200 inverted epifluorescence microscope with a temperature-controlled Attofluor cell chamber (Molecular Probes). NaCl was added to a final concentration of 1.5 m for polypeptides EP20-24 and EP:K to A. NaCl was added to a final concentration of 1 m for polypeptide EP:K to Y. Sample chamber temperature was held constant at 5 °C above the coacervation temperature. All samples were imaged for 90 min, with snapshots taken after 60 min of incubation using differential interference contrast mode. To prepare specimens for electron microscopy, 4 μl of protein suspension (coacervate or fibrils) was diluted to 0.01 to 0.05 mg/ml and absorbed onto freshly glow-discharged carbon films prepared from copper rhodium grids (Electron Microscopy Sciences). The grids were washed in 10 μl of filtered distilled water, blotted with filter paper, stained using 10 μl of freshly filtered 2% uranyl acetate, and blotted a final time. The grids were then air-dried at 20 °C. Transmission electron microscopy images were obtained using a JEOL 1011 microscope operating at 80 keV. Coacervate samples of elastin-like polypeptides isotopically labeled with 13C and 15N for NMR measurement were prepared by incubating 1 mm polypeptide solution in PBS, pH 7.4, with 1.5 m NaCl at 37 °C for 3 days. Polymerized materials labeled with 13C and 15N were prepared by genipin cross-linking as described previously (31.Miao M. Sitarz E. Bellingham C.M. Won E. Muiznieks L.D. Keeley F.W. Sequence and domain arrangements influence mechanical properties of elastin-like polymeric elastomers.Biopolymers. 2013; 99: 392-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Lyophilized protein was packed into 22-μl 3.2-mm magic angle spinning (MAS) rotors. Hydrated coacervate or fibril samples were centrifuged, and the pellets were washed with water to remove salt and then packed into 36-μl 3.2-mm rotors with watertight seals. Solid-state NMR measurements were performed using a triple-resonance 3.2-mm T3 MAS probe in a Varian VNMRS spectrometer operating at an 1H frequency of 499.70 MHz. Temperature control was obtained using high flow rates of cooled dry air on the sample, with temperature at the sample calibrated to 35 °C using the 207Pb chemical shift of Pb(NO3)2 (37.Bielecki A. Burum D.P. Temperature-dependence of Pb-207 Mas spectra of solid lead nitrate-an accurate, sensitive thermometer for variable-temperature Mas.J. Magn. Reson. 1995; 116: 215-220Crossref Scopus (553) Google Scholar). All spectra were externally referenced to the downfield 13C resonance of adamantine at 38.56 ppm relative to tetramethylsilane (38.Morcombe C.R. Zilm K.W. Chemical shift referencing in MAS solid state NMR.J. Magn. Reson. 2003; 162: 479-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed at a MAS frequency of 11 kHz. Cross-polarization was implemented using radio frequency field strengths of 40–60 kHz (13C) and 50–80 kHz (1H), a linear ramp on the 13C channel, and contact times of 1 to 1.5 ms. π/2 pulse widths on all channels were 2.0–4.0 μs, and 1H decoupling fields of 100 kHz were applied during all t1 and t2 acquisition periods, using a two pulse phase modulation decoupling scheme (39.Bennett A.E.

Here we optimized the expression and purification of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Msh2-Msh3 and performed a comparative study of Msh2-Msh3 and Msh2-Msh6 for mispair binding, sliding clamp formation, and Mlh1-Pms1 recruitment. Msh2-Msh3 formed sliding clamps and recruited Mlh1-Pms1 on +1, +2, +3, and +4 insertion/deletions and CC, AA, and possibly GG mispairs, whereas Msh2-Msh6 formed mispair-dependent sliding clamps and recruited Mlh1-Pms1 on 7 of the 8 possible base:base mispairs, the +1 insertion/deletion mispair, and to a low level on the +2 but not the +3 or +4 insertion/deletion mispairs and not on the CC mispair. The mispair specificity of sliding clamp formation and Mlh1-Pms1 recruitment but not mispair binding alone correlated best with genetic data on the mispair specificity of Msh2-Msh3- and Msh2-Msh6-dependent mismatch repair in vivo. Analysis of an Msh2-Msh6/Msh3 chimeric protein and mutant Msh2-Msh3 complexes showed that the nucleotide binding domain and communicating regions but not the mispair binding domain of Msh2-Msh3 are responsible for the extremely rapid dissociation of Msh2-Msh3 sliding clamps from DNA relative to that seen for Msh2-Msh6, and that amino acid residues predicted to stabilize Msh2-Msh3 interactions with bent, strand-separated mispair-containing DNA are more critical for the recognition of small +1 insertion/deletions than larger +4 insertion/deletions."
https://openalex.org/W2107997598,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a common central blinding disease of the elderly. Homozygosity for a sequence variant causing Y402H and I62V substitutions in the gene for complement factor H (CFH) is strongly associated with risk of AMD. CFH, secreted by many cell types, including those of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), is a regulatory protein that inhibits complement activation. Recessive Stargardt maculopathy is another central blinding disease caused by mutations in the gene for ABCA4, a transporter in photoreceptor outer segments (OS) that clears retinaldehyde and prevents formation of toxic bisretinoids. Photoreceptors daily shed their distal OS, which are phagocytosed by the RPE cells. Here, we investigated the relationship between the CFH haplotype of human RPE (hRPE) cells, exposure to OS containing bisretinoids, and complement activation. We show that hRPE cells of the AMD-predisposing CFH haplotype (HH402/VV62) are attacked by complement following exposure to bisretinoid-containing Abca4(-/-) OS. This activation was dependent on factor B, indicating involvement of the alternative pathway. In contrast, hRPE cells of the AMD-protective CFH haplotype (YY402/II62) showed no complement activation following exposure to either Abca4(-/-) or wild-type OS. The AMD-protective YY402/II62 hRPE cells were more resistant to the membrane attack complex, whereas HH402/VV62 hRPE cells showed significant membrane attack complex deposition following ingestion of Abca4(-/-) OS. These results suggest that bisretinoid accumulation in hRPE cells stimulates activation and dysregulation of complement. Cells with an intact complement negative regulatory system are protected from complement attack, whereas cells with reduced CFH synthesis because of the Y402H and I62V substitutions are vulnerable to disease."
https://openalex.org/W2001469017,"The protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and kinases such as germinal center kinase III (GCKIII) can interact with striatins to form a supramolecular complex called striatin-interacting phosphatase and kinase (STRIPAK) complex. Despite the fact that the STRIPAK complex regulates multiple cellular events, it remains only partially understood how this complex itself is assembled and regulated for differential biological functions. Our recent work revealed the activation mechanism of GCKIIIs by MO25, as well as how GCKIIIs heterodimerize with CCM3, a molecular bridge between GCKIII and striatins. Here we dissect the structural features of the coiled coil domain of striatin 3, a novel type of PP2A regulatory subunit that functions as a scaffold for the assembly of the STRIPAK complex. We have determined the crystal structure of a selenomethionine-labeled striatin 3 coiled coil domain, which shows it to assume a parallel dimeric but asymmetric conformation containing a large bend. This result combined with a number of biophysical analyses provide evidence that the coiled coil domain of striatin 3 and the PP2A A subunit form a stable core complex with a 2:2 stoichiometry. Structure-based mutational studies reveal that homodimerization of striatin 3 is essential for its interaction with PP2A and therefore assembly of the STRIPAK complex. Wild-type striatin 3 but not the mutants defective in PP2A binding strongly suppresses apoptosis of Jurkat cells induced by the GCKIII kinase MST3, most likely through a mechanism in which striatin recruits PP2A to negatively regulate the activation of MST3. Collectively, our work provides structural insights into the organization of the STRIPAK complex and will facilitate further functional studies."

The goal of this study was to analyze whether depletion of aggregates from an AD brain suppresses its in vivo “seeding” capability. Removal of aggregates was performed by using the Aggregate Specific Reagent 1 (ASR1) compound which has been previously described to specifically bind misfolded species. Our results show that pre-treatment with ASR1-coupled magnetic beads reduces the in vivo misfolding inducing capability of an AD brain extract. These findings shed light respect to the active principle responsible for the prion-like spreading of Alzheimer's amyloid pathology and open the possibility of using seeds-capturing reagents as a promising target for AD treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2068886897,"Objectives Riboflavin (vitamin B2) has been shown in animal studies to affect the absorption and metabolism of iron. Cross-sectional population studies show a relationship between riboflavin intake and anemia but prospective population studies are limited. The aim of the study was to determine the relationship between riboflavin intake and the risk of anemia in a Chinese cohort. Method The study used data from 1253 Chinese men and women who participated in two waves of the Jiangsu Nutrition Study (JIN), five years apart, in 2002 and 2007. Riboflavin intake and hemoglobin (Hb) were quantitatively assessed together with dietary patterns, lifestyle, socio-demographic and health-related factors. Results At baseline, 97.2% of participants had inadequate riboflavin intake (below the estimate average requirement). Riboflavin intake was positively associated with anemia at baseline, but low riboflavin intake was associated with an increased risk of anemia at follow-up among those anemic at baseline. In the multivariate model, adjusting for demographic and lifestyle factors and dietary patterns, the relative risk and 95% confidence interval for anemia at follow-up, across quartiles of riboflavin intake were: 1, 0.82(0.54–1.23), 0.56(0.34–0.93), 0.52(0.28–0.98) (p for trend 0.021). There was a significant interaction between riboflavin and iron intake; when riboflavin intake was low, a high iron intake was associated with a lower probability of anemia at follow-up. This association disappeared when riboflavin intake was high. Conclusion Inadequate riboflavin intake is common and increases the risk of anemia in Chinese adults. Given the interaction with iron intake correcting inadequate riboflavin intake may be a priority in the prevention of anemia, and population based measurement and intervention trials are required."
https://openalex.org/W2010357102,"Adenoviruses have been recognized as important causal pathogens of community-acquired diarrhea (CAD) among children, but their role in hospital-acquired diarrhea (HAD) is not well-understood. Hospitalized children with acute diarrhea and children who visited the outpatient department due to diarrhea were investigated from 2011 to 2012. Adenovirus was detected in stool specimens by PCR and further characterized by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. SPSS software (version 19.0) was used for statistical analyses. A total of 2233 diarrheal children were enrolled in this study; this sample was comprised of 1371 hospitalized children, including 885 with CAD (IP-CAD) and 486 with HAD, and 862 outpatients with CAD (OP-CAD). Among these 2,233 patients, adenovirus was detected in 219 cases (9.8%). The positive rates for adenovirus were significantly different between the IP-CAD (9.3%), HAD (13.8%) and OP-CAD (8.1%) cases (X² = 11.76, p = 0.003). The positive rate of adenovirus was lower in infants under six months of age compared to the positive rates in the other age groups. Of the 219 of adenovirus positive patients, 91 (41.6%) were identified as having serotype 41. Although enteric adenovirus (group F) was the most frequently detected adenovirus among children with either CAD or HAD, the role of non-enteric adenoviruses, especially the adenovirus 31 type (19.7%), cannot be ignored in diarrheal children."

B. burgdorferi sl complex, currently comprising at least 19 genospecies, includes the main pathogenic species responsible for human disease in Europe: B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (ss), B. afzelii, and B. garinii. In this study, for the first time, MALDI-TOF MS was applied to Borrelia spp., supplementing the existing database, limited to the species B. burgdorferi ss, B . spielmanii and B. garinii, with the species B. afzelii, in order to enable the identification of all the species potentially implicated in LB in Europe. Moreover, we supplemented the database also with B. hermsii, which is the primary cause of tick-borne relapsing fever in western North America, B. japonica, circulating in Asia, and another reference strain of B. burgdorferi ss (B31 strain). The dendrogram obtained by analyzing the protein profiles of the different Borrelia species reflected Borrelia taxonomy, showing that all the species included in the Borrelia sl complex clustered in a unique branch, while Borrelia hermsii clustered separately. In conclusion, in this study MALDI-TOF MS proved a useful tool suitable for identification of Borrelia spp. both for diagnostic purpose and epidemiological surveillance."
https://openalex.org/W2040660114,"Human CD4 is a membrane-bound glycoprotein expressed on the surface of certain leukocytes, where it plays a key role in the activation of immunostimulatory T cells and acts as the primary receptor for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) glycoprotein (gp120). Although growing evidence suggests that redox exchange reactions involving CD4 disulfides, potentially catalyzed by cell surface-secreted oxidoreductases such as thioredoxin (Trx) and protein disulfide isomerase, play an essential role in regulating the activity of CD4, their mechanism(s) and biological utility remain incompletely understood. To gain more insights in this regard, we generated a panel of recombinant 2-domain CD4 proteins (2dCD4), including wild-type and Cys/Ala variants, and used these to show that while protein disulfide isomerase has little capacity for 2dCD4 reduction, Trx reduces 2dCD4 highly efficiently, catalyzing the formation of conformationally distinct monomeric 2dCD4 isomers, and a stable, disulfide-linked 2dCD4 dimer. Moreover, we show that HIV gp120 is incapable of binding a fully oxidized, monomeric 2dCD4 in which both domain 1 and 2 disulfides are intact, but binds robustly to reduced counterparts that are the ostensible products of Trx-mediated isomerization. Finally, we demonstrate that Trx-driven dimerization of CD4, a process believed to be critical for the establishment of functional MHCII-TCR-CD4 antigen presentation complexes, is impaired when CD4 is bound to gp120. These observations reinforce the importance of cell surface redox activity for HIV entry and posit the intriguing possibility that one of the many pathogenic effects of HIV may be related to gp120-mediated inhibition of oxidoreductive CD4 isomerization."
https://openalex.org/W2014067098,"Background Promoting physical activity in youth is important for health, but existing physical activity interventions have had limited success. We aimed to inform intervention design by i) describing drop-out, continuation and uptake of specific activities over the transition to adolescence; and ii) examining Variety (number of different activities/week) and Frequency (number of activity session/week) of activity participation and their associations with changes in objectively measured physical activity from childhood to adolescence. Methods At age 10.2±0.3 and 14.2±0.3 years, 319 children in the SPEEDY study (46% boys) wore GT1M Actigraph accelerometers for 7 days and provided self-reported participation (never, once, 2 to 3 times or four or more times, over the last 7 days) in 23 leisure-time activities. Associations of change in moderate-to-vigorous intensity PA (MVPA) (≥2000 counts/minute) and change in total physical activity (TPA) (average accelerometer counts/minute) with exposure variables Z-score transformed (change in) Variety and Frequency were examined using multilevel linear regression, clustered by school, in simple and adjusted models. Results The number of children ever reporting a specific activity ranged from 30 (‘Hockey’) to 279 (‘Running or jogging’). Some activities were susceptible to drop-out (e.g. ‘Skipping’) but others were commonly continued or taken up (e.g. ‘Household chores’). Overall, Variety and Frequency declined (mean±SD ΔVariety −3.1±4.4 activities/week; ΔFrequency −7.2±12.0 session/week). ΔMVPA and ΔTPA were not associated with Variety or Frequency at baseline, nor with ΔVariety or ΔFrequency (p>0.29 in all models). Conclusions Popularity of specific activities as well as drop-out, continuation and uptake should be considered in future intervention development. Activities that are commonly continued or taken up may be more valuable to encourage in interventions than those with low participation or high drop-out. We did not find evidence to support the idea that Variety and Frequency may be key elements to include in future interventions."

This study evaluated the association between WheiR and CKD.In this longitudinal cohort study, 4841 Japanese workers (3686 males, 1155 females) 18 to 67 years of age in 2008 were followed up until 2011. CKD was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate of <60 mL/min/1.73 m² (by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation for Japanese) or dipstick proteinuria (≥1+). Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine the relationship between WheiR and development of CKD.A total of 384 (7.9%) participants (300 men and 84 women) were found to have new CKD. The incidence of CKD was 13.7, 24.2, 37.9 and 43.7 per 1000 person-years of follow-up in the lowest, second, third and highest quartiles of WheiR, respectively. After adjustment for potential confounders, the adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) for CKD were 1.00 (reference), 1.23 (0.85, 1.78), 1.59 (1.11, 2.26) and 1.62 (1.13, 2.32) through the quartiles of WheiR, respectively. WheiR had a significant predictive value for the incidence of both proteinuria and low estimated glomerular filtration rate. After subdivision according to gender, the relationship between WheiR and the incidence of CKD was statistically significant in the unadjusted model. However, after adjusting for potential confounders, WheiR was significantly associated with the incidence of CKD in females, whereas it was not significant in males.WheiR, which is commonly used as an index of central obesity, is associated with CKD. There was a significant gender difference in the relationship between CKD and WheiR."
https://openalex.org/W1979788861,"Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) 1, that catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step in the degradation of L-tryptophan, has an important immunomodulatory function. The activity of IDO1 increases in various inflammatory diseases, including tumors, autoimmune diseases, and different kinds of inflammation. We evaluated the suppressive effect of plant extracts or phytochemicals on IDO1 induction and activity; sixteen kinds of plants extracts and fourteen kinds of phytochemicals were examined. As a result, the methanol extracts of Myoga flower buds, which are traditional Japanese foods, and labdane-type diterpene galanal derived from Myoga flowers significantly suppressed IDO1 activity. The Lineweaver-Burk plot analysis indicated that galanal is a competitive inhibitor. Galanal attenuated L-kynurenine formation with an IC₅₀ value of 7.7 µM in the assay system using recombinant human IDO1, and an IC₅₀ value of 45 nM in the cell-based assay. Further, mechanistic analysis revealed that galanal interfered with the transcriptional function of the nuclear factor-κB and the interferon-γ signaling pathway. These effects of galanal are important for immune response. Because the inhibitory effect of galanal on IDO1 activity was stronger than that of 1-methyl tryptophan, a tryptophan analog, galanal may have great potential as the novel drug for various immune-related diseases."

The HSP70/HSP90-organizing protein (HOP) is a co-chaperone that cooperates with HSP70 and HSP90 in catalysis of protein folding and maturation in the cytosol. We show here that HOP has ATP-binding activity comparable to that of HSP70/HSP90, and that HOP slowly hydrolyzes ATP. Analysis of deletion mutants revealed that the ATPase domain of HOP is in the N-terminal TPR1-DP1-TPR2A segment. In addition, HOP changes its conformation in the presence of ATP. These results indicate that HOP is a unique co-chaperone that undergoes an ATP-dependent conformational change."
https://openalex.org/W2075395099,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major cause of liver disease. The molecular machinery of HCV assembly and particle release remains obscure. A better understanding of the assembly events might reveal new potential antiviral strategies. It was suggested that the nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A), an attractive recent drug target, participates in the production of infectious particles as a result of its interaction with the HCV core protein. However, prior to the present study, the NS5A-binding site in the viral core remained unknown. We found that the D1 domain of core contains the NS5A-binding site with the strongest interacting capacity in the basic P38-K74 cluster. We also demonstrated that the N-terminal basic residues of core at positions 50, 51, 59 and 62 were required for NS5A binding. Analysis of all substitution combinations of R50A, K51A, R59A, and R62A, in the context of the HCVcc system, showed that single, double, triple, and quadruple mutants were fully competent for viral RNA replication, but deficient in secretion of viral particles. Furthermore, we found that the extracellular and intracellular infectivity of all the mutants was abolished, suggesting a defect in the formation of infectious particles. Importantly, we showed that the interaction between the single and quadruple core mutants and NS5A was impaired in cells expressing full-length HCV genome. Interestingly, mutations of the four basic residues of core did not alter the association of core or NS5A with lipid droplets. This study showed for the first time that basic residues in the D1 domain of core that are critical for the formation of infectious extracellular and intracellular particles also play a role in core-NS5A interactions."

In addition, there is a lack of accurate diagnostic indices with which to evaluate the activity of the disease. The aim of this study was to identify UC-associated proteins as biomarkers for the diagnosis, and objective assessment of disease activity.Differential expression of serum proteins from UC patients compared to normal controls was analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). The expression of heat shock factor 2(HSF2)in colonic mucosa in Crohn's disease, Behcet's disease, ulcerative colitis, intestinal tuberculosis, infective enteritis, intestinal lymphoma, and normal controls was investigated by immunohistochemistry (IHC). The expression of the HSF2 in colonic mucosa of UC subjects with varying severity of disease was measured by real time-PCR and Western Blots. The expression of HSF2 was inhibited by HSF2 small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection in Caco-2 cells. The concentrations of HSF2, IL-1β, and TNF-α in serum and IL-1β, and TNF-α in the supernatants of transfected Caco-2 cells were determined by ELISA.HSF2 was differentially expressed in UC patients compared to normal controls. HSF2 expression was significantly higher in the intestinal mucosa of UC patients compared to other six groups. The results of immunohistochemistry, real time-PCR, Western Blots, and ELISA showed that the expression of HSF2 increased in parallel with the severity of UC. The serum concentration of HSF2 also positively correlated with levels of IL-1β and TNF-α. After down-regulation expression of HSF2 in Caco-2 cells by RNA interference, the productions of IL-1β and TNF-α stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) increased dramatically.HSF2 appears to be a potential novel molecular marker for UC activity, and may provide a basis for studies on the pathogenesis and novel therapeutic targets for UC."
https://openalex.org/W2051889622,"Age-related vascular diseases are induced by vascular dysfunction, which involves changes in the vasomotor response. The voltage-dependent L-type calcium channel (VDCC) protein is involved in the regulation of vessel function (contraction/relaxation action). In the present study, we evaluated age-related vasomotor function and expression of the signal-related target proteins, including VDCC, using thoracic aorta from both 8- and 40-week old Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). In contraction experiments using aortic rings, vasomotor responses of both phenylephrine-induced contraction and acetylcholine-induced relaxation were significantly attenuated with age in SHR, whereas WKY did not lose activity with age. Contraction induced by angiotensin II was impaired only for the 40-week old SHR among all the rat groups tested, although enhanced AT1R/reduced AT2R expression with age was observed for both WKY and SHR. In contrast, a vasomotor responsiveness to Bay K 8644 (a VDCC agonist) at the initial contraction phase was significantly attenuated in both 40-week WKY and SHR with significant reduction of VDCC protein expression. The reduced VDCC expression in 40-week old rats significantly lowered the relaxation activity of VDCC blockers, such as verapamil and Trp-His, but did not affect that of nifedipine. Taken together, we provided the first evidence that aging caused a reduction of VDCC expression in rat aorta, irrespective of the rat strain, along with diminishment of the therapeutic potential of VDCC blockers."
https://openalex.org/W2069376195,"Normal heart rhythm (sinus rhythm) is governed by the sinoatrial node, a specialized and highly heterogeneous collection of spontaneously active myocytes in the right atrium. Sinoatrial node dysfunction, characterized by slow and/or asynchronous pacemaker activity and even failure, is associated with cardiovascular disease (e.g. heart failure, atrial fibrillation). While tremendous progress has been made in understanding the molecular and ionic basis of automaticity in sinoatrial node cells, the dynamics governing sinoatrial nodel cell synchrony and overall pacemaker function remain unclear. Here, a well-validated computational model of the mouse sinoatrial node cell is used to test the hypothesis that sinoatrial node cell dynamics reflect an inherent restitution property (cycle length restitution) that may give rise to a wide range of behavior from regular periodicity to highly complex, irregular activation. Computer simulations are performed to determine the cycle length restitution curve in the computational model using a newly defined voltage pulse protocol. The ability of the restitution curve to predict sinoatrial node cell dynamics (e.g., the emergence of irregular spontaneous activity) and susceptibility to termination is evaluated. Finally, ionic and tissue level factors (e.g. ion channel conductances, ion concentrations, cell-to-cell coupling) that influence restitution and sinoatrial node cell dynamics are explored. Together, these findings suggest that cycle length restitution may be a useful tool for analyzing cell dynamics and dysfunction in the sinoatrial node."

Cancer cell migration/invasion toward angiogenic microvasculature is a key step in metastatic spread. We therefore studied how macrophages stimulated breast cancer cell interactions with endothelial cells. Macrophages produced cytokines, such as interleukin-8 and tumor necrosis factor-α, to stimulate endothelin (ET) and ET receptor (ETR) expression in breast cancer cells and human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs). ET-1 was induced to a greater extent from HUVECs than from breast cancer cells, resulting in a density difference that facilitated cancer cell chemotaxis toward HUVECs. Macrophages also stimulated breast cancer cell adhesion to HUVECs and transendothelial migration, which were repressed by ET-1 antibody or ETR inhibitors. The ET axis induced integrins, such as αV and β1, and their counterligands, such as intercellular adhesion molecule-2 and P-selectin, in breast cancer cells and HUVECs, and antibodies against these integrins efficiently suppressed macrophage-stimulated breast cancer cell interactions with HUVECs. ET-1 induced Ets-like kinase-1 (Elk-1), signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT-3), and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) phosphorylation in breast cancer cells. The use of inhibitors to prevent their phosphorylation or ectopic overexpression of dominant-negative IκBα perturbed ET-1-induced integrin αV and integrin β1 expression. The physical associations of these three transcriptional factors with the gene promoters of the two integrins were furthermore evidenced by a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Finally, our mouse orthotopic tumor model revealed an ET axis-mediated lung metastasis of macrophage-stimulated breast cancer cells, suggesting that the ET axis was involved in macrophage-enhanced breast cancer cell endothelial interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2023528750,"Temporary wetlands dominate the wet season landscape of temperate, semi-arid and arid regions, yet, other than their direct loss to development and agriculture, little information exists on how remaining wetlands have been altered by anthropogenic conversion of surrounding landscapes. This study investigates relationships between the extent and type of habitat transformation around temporary wetlands and their water column physico-chemical characteristics. A set of 90 isolated depression wetlands (seasonally inundated) occurring on coastal plains of the south-western Cape mediterranean-climate region of South Africa was sampled during the winter/spring wet season of 2007. Wetlands were sampled across habitat transformation gradients according to the areal cover of agriculture, urban development and alien invasive vegetation within 100 and 500 m radii of each wetland edge. We hypothesized that the principal drivers of physico-chemical conditions in these wetlands (e.g. soil properties, basin morphology) are altered by habitat transformation. Multivariate multiple regression analyses (distance-based Redundancy Analysis) indicated significant associations between wetland physico-chemistry and habitat transformation (overall transformation within 100 and 500 m, alien vegetation cover within 100 and 500 m, urban cover within 100 m); although for significant regressions the amount of variation explained was very low (range: ∼2 to ∼5.5%), relative to that explained by purely spatio-temporal factors (range: ∼35.5 to ∼43%). The nature of the relationships between each type of transformation in the landscape and individual physico-chemical variables in wetlands were further explored with univariate multiple regressions. Results suggest that conservation of relatively narrow (∼100 m) buffer strips around temporary wetlands is likely to be effective in the maintenance of natural conditions in terms of physico-chemical water quality."
https://openalex.org/W2024530208,"Geoengineering by stratospheric aerosol injection has been proposed as a policy response to warming from human emissions of greenhouse gases, but it may produce unequal regional impacts. We present a simple, intuitive risk-based framework for classifying these impacts according to whether geoengineering increases or decreases the risk of substantial climate change, with further classification by the level of existing risk from climate change from increasing carbon dioxide concentrations. This framework is applied to two climate model simulations of geoengineering counterbalancing the surface warming produced by a quadrupling of carbon dioxide concentrations, with one using a layer of sulphate aerosol in the lower stratosphere, and the other a reduction in total solar irradiance. The solar dimming model simulation shows less regional inequality of impacts compared with the aerosol geoengineering simulation. In the solar dimming simulation, 10% of the Earth's surface area, containing 10% of its population and 11% of its gross domestic product, experiences greater risk of substantial precipitation changes under geoengineering than under enhanced carbon dioxide concentrations. In the aerosol geoengineering simulation the increased risk of substantial precipitation change is experienced by 42% of Earth's surface area, containing 36% of its population and 60% of its gross domestic product."
https://openalex.org/W2041215266,"Introduction Neurogenic pulmonary edema (NPE) is an acute and serious complication after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) with high mortality. The present study aimed to test the therapeutic potential of brilliant blue G (BBG), a selective P2X purinoceptor 7 (P2X7R) antagonist, on NPE in a rat SAH model. Methods SAH was induced by endovascular perforation. 86 Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into sham, vehicle-, or BBG-treatment groups. Mortality, body weight, SAH grading, neurological deficits, NPE clinical symptoms, and pulmonary index were measured at 24 hours following SAH. Western blot, gelatin zymography, lung histopathology, and immunofluorescence staining were performed in the left lung lobe to explore the underlying mechanisms at 24 hours post-surgery. Results The incidence of clinical symptoms was correlated with pulmonary index. P2X7R and the marker of alveolar type I epithelial cells (the mucin-type glycoprotein T1-α) immunoreactivities were generally co-localized. BBG administration decreased mature interleukin-1β, myeloperoxidase, and matrix metallopeptidase-9 activation, but increased tight junction proteins, such as ZO-1 and occludin, which ameliorated pulmonary edema via anti-inflammation and improved neurological deficits. Conclusion P2X7R inhibition prevented NPE after SAH by attenuating inflammation. Thus, BBG is a potential therapeutic application for NPE after SAH and warrants further research."

Often, this adaptation involves regulatory changes which modulate gene expression. In the budding yeast, ribosomal-related gene expression correlates with cell growth rate across different environments. To examine whether the same relationship between gene expression and growth rate is observed also across natural populations, we measured gene expression, growth rate and ethanol production of twenty-four wild type yeast strains originating from diverse habitats, grown on the pentose sugar xylulose. We found that expression of ribosome-related genes did not correlate with growth rate. Rather, growth rate was correlated with the expression of amino acid biosynthesis genes. Searching other databases, we observed a similar correlation between growth rate and amino-acid biosyntehsis genes in a library of gene deletions. We discuss the implications of our results for understanding how cells coordinate their translation capacity with available nutrient resources."
https://openalex.org/W2027831802,"Classical swine fever virus (CSFV) causes a broad range of disease in pigs, from acute symptoms including high fever and hemorrhages, to chronic disease or unapparent infection, depending on the virus strain. CSFV belongs to the genus Pestivirus of the family Flaviviridae. It carries a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome. An internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) in the 5' untranslated region (UTR) drives the translation of a single open reading frame encoding a 3898 amino acid long polypeptide chain. The open reading frame is followed by a 3' UTR comprising four highly structured stem-loops. In the present study, a synthetic RNA composed of the 5' and 3' UTRs of the CSFV genome devoid of any viral coding sequence and separated by a luciferase gene cassette (designated 5'UTR-Luc-3'UTR) triggered apoptotic cell death as early as 4 h post-transfection. The apoptosis was measured by DNA laddering analysis, TUNEL assay, annexin-V binding determined by flow cytometry, and by analysis of caspase activation. Contrasting with this, only trace DNA laddering was observed in cells transfected with the individual 5' or 3' UTR RNA; even when the 5' UTR and 3' UTR were co-transfected as separate RNA molecules, DNA laddering did not reach the level induced by the chimeric 5'UTR-Luc-3'UTR RNA. Interestingly, RNA composed of the 5'UTR and of stem-loop I of the 3'UTR triggered much stronger apoptosis than the 5' or 3'UTR alone. These results indicate that the 5' and 3' UTRs act together in cis induce apoptosis. We furthered obtained evidence that the UTR-mediated apoptosis required double-stranded RNA and involved translation shutoff possibly through activation of PKR."

We found that infants who developed DHF with a primary DENV infection had higher WHO weight-for-age z scores before and at the time of infection compared to infants with primary DENV infections who did not develop DHF. In addition, TLR 7/8-stimulated tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) production from myeloid-derived cells was higher among well-nourished infants. Leptin augmented TLR 7/8-mediated TNF-α production in monocytes and decreased intracellular cAMP levels. Circulating leptin levels were elevated during early infancy and correlated with WHO weight-for-age z scores. Our data support a plausible hypothesis as to why well-nourished infants are at risk for developing DHF with their first DENV infection."

Upon glutamate binding, these receptors undergo a series of conformational rearrangements regulating channel function. Allosteric modulators can bind within a pocket adjacent to the ligand-binding domain to stabilize specific conformations and prevent desensitization. Yelshansky et al. (Yelshansky, M. V., Sobolevsky, A. I., Jatzke, C., and Wollmuth, L. P. (2004) J. Neurosci. 24, 4728-4736) described a model of an electrostatic interaction between the ligand-binding domain and linker region to the pore that regulated channel desensitization. To test this hypothesis, we have conducted a series of experiments focusing on the R628E mutation. Using ultrafast perfusion with voltage clamp, we applied glutamate to outside-out patches pulled from transiently transfected HEK 293 cells expressing wild type or R628E mutant GluA2. In response to a brief pulse of glutamate (1 ms), mutant receptors deactivated with significantly slower kinetics than wild type receptors. In addition, R628E receptors showed significantly more steady-state current in response to a prolonged (500-ms) glutamate application. These changes in receptor kinetics occur through a pathway that is independent of that of allosteric modulators, which show an additive effect on R628E receptors. In addition, ligand binding assays revealed the R628E mutation to have increased affinity for agonist. Finally, we reconciled experimental data with computer simulations that explicitly model mutant and modulator interactions. Our data suggest that R628E stabilizes the receptor closed cleft conformation by reducing agonist dissociation and the transition to the desensitized state. These results suggest that the AMPA receptor external vestibule is a viable target for new positive allosteric modulators."

Interestingly, these studies also revealed that complete unfolding of single VWFA2 domains is not necessary for cleavage by ADAMTS13 as a partially unfolded intermediate is also a suitable substrate (17.Zhang Q.

Previously, we have shown that platelet-decorated VWF strings are cleaved multiple times by ADAMTS13, with a preference for sites that become exposed after local elongations of the string (23.De Ceunynck K.

Here, we aimed to gain insight into the ADAMTS13′ binding mode on these mobile VWF strings by directly visualizing how and where single inactive ADAMTS13E225Q enzymes bind to these VWF substrates using SMF microscopy (SMFM). SM measurements have been extensively applied to track proteins in membranes of living cells (24.Sako Y. Minoghchi S. Yanagida T.

It is important to note that, because the A2 domain is only available once VWF strings are stretched, investigation of the interaction between ADAMTS13 and its substrate is done under flow, which greatly increases the complexity of the system. Studying binding of ADAMTS13 molecules (nm) to long VWF strings (μm) that move in the direction of flow imposes specific requirements to the experimental setup, reminiscent to SM experiments on flow-stretched tethered DNA (30.Tafvizi A. Huang F. Fersht A.R. Mirny L.A. van Oijen A.M. A single-molecule characterization of p53 search on DNA.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Hence, we constructed a customized SMF microscope and developed specific single particle tracking (SPT) software (33.Saxton M.J. Single-particle tracking: connecting the dots.Nat. Methods. 2008; 5: 671-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) to determine ADAMTS13 trajectories on these mobile VWF strings. Blood was drawn from healthy volunteers who gave informed consent. The study was approved by the Institutional Clinical Review Board of the KU Leuven (Leuven, Belgium) and performed according to the Declaration of Helsinki. Washed platelets were prepared as described previously (23.De Ceunynck K. Rocha S. Feys H.B. De Meyer S.F. Uji-i H. Deckmyn H. Hofkens J. Vanhoorelbeke K.

Chem. 2011; 286: 36361-36367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Platelets were fluorescently labeled by incubation with 100 nm 3,3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide (DIOC, Invitrogen) for 10 min before use. All steps were performed at room temperature (RT). Blood outgrowth endothelial cells (BOECs) were isolated from the blood of healthy volunteers, characterized by immunofluorescent staining and grown in EBM-2/EGM-2 medium (Lonza, San Diego, CA) as described (34.Lin Y. Chang L. Solovey A. Healey J.F. Lollar P. Hebbel R.P.

Recombinant human ADAMTS13 (rADAMTS13) and catalytically inactive ADAMTS13 (rADAMTS13E225Q) were expressed using an inducible T-Rex system (Invitrogen) and purified as described previously (36.Feys H.B. Anderson P.J. Vanhoorelbeke K. Majerus E.M. Sadler J.E. Multi-step binding of ADAMTS-13 to von Willebrand factor.J. Thromb. Haemost. 2009; 7: 2088-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). rADAMTS13 and rADAMTS13E225Q concentrations were determined using a sandwich ELISA with normal human pooled plasma (n = 20) as a reference (37.Feys H.B. Liu F. Dong N. Pareyn I. Vauterin S. Vandeputte N. Noppe W. Ruan C. Deckmyn H. Vanhoorelbeke K. ADAMTS-13 plasma level determination uncovers antigen absence in acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and ethnic differences.J. Thromb. Haemost. 2006; 4: 955-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Purity was estimated by SDS-PAGE with subsequent Simply BlueTM staining (Invitrogen) (36.Feys H.B. Anderson P.J. Vanhoorelbeke K. Majerus E.M. Sadler J.E. Multi-step binding of ADAMTS-13 to von Willebrand factor.J. Thromb. Haemost. 2009; 7: 2088-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Purified rADAMTS13, rADAMTS13E225Q, and mouse monoclonal IgG1 control antibody (Ab, Dako Cytomation, Glostrup, Denmark) were dialyzed against 0.15 m bicarbonate buffer (pH 8.3). A 2-fold molar excess of the Atto647N-NHS ester (Atto-tec, Germany) was added. After a 1-h incubation at RT, free dye was removed by dialysis against HBS (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm ZnCl2, and 150 mm NaCl) or PBS buffer for rADAMTS13/rADAMTS13E225Q or IgG control, respectively. The concentrations of ADAMTS13 solutions were determined as described (37.Feys H.B. Liu F. Dong N. Pareyn I. Vauterin S. Vandeputte N. Noppe W. Ruan C. Deckmyn H. Vanhoorelbeke K. ADAMTS-13 plasma level determination uncovers antigen absence in acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and ethnic differences.J. Thromb. Haemost. 2006; 4: 955-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Activity of rADAMTS13 and rADAMTS13-Atto647N was evaluated using a fluorogenic VWF substrate (FRETS-VWF73, Peptides International, Louisville, KY). In brief, FRETS-VWF73 was excited at 355 nm and emission was measured at 460 nm every minute for 1.5 h. Fluorescence intensities were depicted in function of time. The slope of the resulting curve was used as a measure of enzyme activity. Activity of rADAMTS13-Atto647N (0.125 nm) was compared with the activity of unlabeled rADAMTS13 (0.125 nm), which was set as 100%. rADAMTS13 in the presence of EDTA (5 mm) was used as a negative control. Conventional coverslides (Menzel-gläser, Thermo Fisher Scientific) were cleaned by sonication at RT successively in acetone (spectrophotometric grade; Sigma) for 15 min, 1 m sodium hydroxide (Sigma) for 5 min (twice) and Milli-Q (MQ) water (Merck Millipore, Billerica, MA) for 15 min (twice). Coverslides were rinsed with MQ between consecutive steps and finally dried with argon (air liquid) and incubated in an UV-ozone photoreacter (UVP PR-100, UVP, Upland, CA) for at least 1 h. rADAMTS13-Atto647N was captured on coverslides using the in-house developed monoclonal anti-human ADAMTS13 Ab 20A5 (37.Feys H.B. Liu F. Dong N. Pareyn I. Vauterin S. Vandeputte N. Noppe W. Ruan C. Deckmyn H. Vanhoorelbeke K. ADAMTS-13 plasma level determination uncovers antigen absence in acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and ethnic differences.J. Thromb. Haemost. 2006; 4: 955-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), washed with PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, and blocked with PBS, 3% milk. After incubation with 0.1 μg/ml of rADAMTS13-Atto647N for 30 min, coverslides were washed three times with PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, mounted in a chamber, and kept moist during measurements by adding PBS, 0.3% milk. Negative controls included non-coated coverslides or coverslides only coated with Ab and/or PBS, 3% milk. rADAMTS13-Atto647N and rADAMTS13E225Q-Atto647N molecules immobilized on coverslides were continuously excited with laser light and emission light was detected with a cooled electron multiplying (EM) charge-coupled device (CCD) camera (ImageEM, Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu City, Japan) (cf. single molecule microscope set ups). Videos were recorded using Hokawo software (Hamamatsu Photonics) for a maximum 5000 frames at integration times of 30, 50, or 200 ms. The fluorescent intensity of single spots was followed in function of time using a routine developed in Matlab (version 2010, The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA). Dye molecules bleach upon continuous excitation and this is visible as sudden drops in fluorescence intensity. Hence, the number of labels attached on a single molecule can be determined by counting the number of stepwise decreases in fluorescence as a function of time (38.Coffman V.C. Wu J.Q. Counting protein molecules using quantitative fluorescence microscopy.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2012; 37: 499-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Confluent BOEC monolayers were grown on collagen-coated coverslides, stimulated with 25 μm histamine (Sigma) for 10 min at RT, and mounted in a parallel-plate flow chamber as described previously (23.De Ceunynck K. Rocha S. Feys H.B. De Meyer S.F. Uji-i H. Deckmyn H. Hofkens J. Vanhoorelbeke K. Local elongation of endothelial cell anchored von Willebrand factor strings precedes rADAMTS13 mediated proteolysis.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 36361-36367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). BOECs were perfused with DIOC-labeled platelets for ∼2 min followed by fluorescently labeled rADAMTS13E225Q-Atto647N (6 nm) in HBS for an additional 3 min (2.5 dyne/cm2). A customized microscope set up was developed to visualize single rADAMTS13E225Q-Atto647N enzymes (see below). Videos were recorded 60 to 90 s after initiation of flow for up to 5000 frames (240 s) using Hokawo software (Hamamatsu Photonics). To detect single rADAMTS13-Atto647N molecules under static conditions, an IX-71 inverted fluorescence microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) was equipped with various epifluorescence objectives (×20 air (numerical aperture (NA) 0.5); ×40 oil (NA 1.3); ×60 oil (NA 1.4); and ×100 oil (NA 1.3); Olympus) and one cooled EM-CCD camera (ImageEM, Hamamatsu Photonics). Using two lenses, an additional ×3.3 magnification was included before this EM-CCD to enable visualization of single ADAMST13 molecules. A 644-nm laser (Spectra Physics, Newport, RI) was used to excite rADAMTS13-Atto647N immobilized on coverslides. The excitation light was guided to the sample using a 650-long pass dichroic mirror (z650rdc). A 665-long pass filter and a 700/75m-band pass filter (HQ665LP and HQ700/75m) were used to select the emission light detected in the EM-CCD camera. To detect rADAMTS13-Atto647N on VWF strings under flow conditions, a ×60 oil objective (NA 1.4; Olympus) was used and the microscope was further equipped with a second cooled EM-CCD (ImageEM, Hamamatsu Photonics) to detect fluorescently labeled platelets. This allowed the exclusion of the ×3.3 magnification before this camera required for correct VWF string identification. Cameras were synchronized in time using a function generator (Stanford Research Systems Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). In addition to the 644-nm laser (for excitation of rADAMTS13-Atto647N), a 491-nm (Cobolt, Solna, Sweden) diode pumped solid-state laser was added to excite the DIOC-labeled platelets. Laser lines were combined with a 505-long pass dichroic (505DCLP) to allow simultaneous excitation of labeled platelets (DIOC) and labeled rADAMTS13 (Atto647N). The lasers were directed toward the sample using a dual band dichroic mirror (z488/633rdc) (Fig. 1) aligned in quasi-total internal reflection fluorescence (39.Tokunaga M. Imamoto N. Sakata-Sogawa K. Highly inclined thin illumination enables clear single-molecule imaging in cells.Nat. Methods. 2008; 5: 159-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar) mode to reduce emission arising from the molecules passing in solution. Samples were illuminated with a thin, laminated excitation sheet using a highly inclined laser beam. Emission light emerging from the sample was split by a 650-long pass dichroic mirror (z650rdc). A 527/30-band pass filter for DIOC (HQ527/30m) and filters for Atto647N as described above (HQ665LP and HQ700/75m) were used to selectively detect fluorescent signals from DIOC-labeled platelets and rADAMTS13-Atto647N (Fig. 1). Filters were obtained from Chroma Technology Corporation (Bellow Falls, VT). Movies were acquired with 30-ms integration time at 32 or 16 Hz. View fields are ∼41 to 41 μm2 (80 × 80 nm2 per pixel) and 120 × 120 μm2 for ADAMTS13 and platelets, respectively. TetraSpeckTM fluorescent 100-nm microspheres (Invitrogen) were used to align the two cameras and overlay fluorescence images from both channels. A sample with TetraSpeck (Invitrogen) fluorescent beads was first used to align the two detection channels, such that the focal planes are the same and the excited area is centered in both cameras. These beads are stained with multiple fluorescent dyes and are therefore detected in both green and red channels. To overlap the fluorescence images acquired in both channels images of TetraSpeck beads were taken with both EM-CCD cameras simultaneously. The images of the ADAMTS13-Atto647N detecting channel (red channel) and the DIOC-labeled platelets detecting channel (green channel) were post-experimentally overlaid with about 18 nm precision using customized software. Briefly, the beads were first automatically detected in both channels using an intensity threshold (Fig. 2, A and B, red circles) and the accurate position of these beads was determined by fitting the point spread function with a two-dimensional Gaussian function. Next, 10 beads were randomly selected in the DIOC channel and the same 10 beads were subsequently selected in the Atto647N channel (Fig. 2, A and B, green circles). The position of the selected beads in both channels was overlaid to assure that the same beads were selected in both images (Fig. 2C). From this overlay a transformation map containing the spatial parameters necessary to correctly overlay the two channels was calculated and applied to the acquired movies to adjust the position of the red channel relative to the green channel. To analyze the binding of ADAMTS13 to platelet-decorated VWF strings in detail, customized routines were developed in Matlab for processing movies recorded by the 2 cameras and detecting either DIOC-labeled platelets or Atto647N-labeled rADAMTS13E225Q. Routines can be provided upon request. Fluorescently labeled platelets were automatically detected using an intensity threshold. Due to differences in fluorescence intensity of labeled platelets this threshold was manually selected for each acquired movie. After smoothing of the images, platelets were automatically detected in all frames of a movie and their centroid was determined from the area of the images where the fluorescence signal was above the threshold. For visualization purposes, selected platelets were encircled (Fig. 3A, right panel, green circles). After automatic detection, manual frame-by-frame correction (up to 5000 frames per movie) was carried out. Non-detected platelets were added and background spots falsely detected as platelets were deleted (Fig. 3A, striped and full arrows, respectively). A single spot corresponds to a platelet if a fluorescent signal (with a size of ∼2 μm) is observed for multiple frames. Observing movement of the platelets in flow is used as an additional criterion. Analysis of enzyme movies was performed using a homemade routine for single molecule localization (33.Saxton M.J. Single-particle tracking: connecting the dots.Nat. Methods. 2008; 5: 671-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). After adequate image processing, points were automatically detected using an intensity threshold. The center of the spot was determined with nanometer accuracy (about 40 nm) by fitting the diffraction-limited point spread function with a two-dimensional Gaussian curve. For visualization purposes, detected enzymes were encircled in all frames of a movie (Fig. 3, B and C, right panel, green circles). After automatic detection, manual frame-by-frame correction (up to 5000 frames per movie) was performed. Non-detected points were added and enzymes passing through flow (visible as lines) and detected multiple times by the software program were deleted (Fig. 3, B and C, full and striped arrows,"
