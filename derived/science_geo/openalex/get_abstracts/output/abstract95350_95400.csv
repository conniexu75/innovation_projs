https://openalex.org/W1961340888,"The kinetics of the activation of Glu-plasminogen and Lys-plasminogen (P) by a two-chain form of human tissue plasminogen activator (A) were studied in purified systems, and in the presence of fibrinogen (f) and of fibrin films (F) of increasing size and surface density. The activation in the purified systems followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics with a Michaelis constant of 65 microM and a catalytic rate constant of 0.06 s-1 for Glu-plasminogen as compared to 19 microM 0.2 s-1 for Lys-plasminogen. In the presence of fibrinogen plots of 1/v versus 1/[P] or 1/v versus 1/[f] yielded straight lines with an apparent Michaelis constant at infinite [f] of 28 microM and a catalytic rate constant of 0.3 s-1 for Glu-plasminogen as compared to 1.8 microM and 0.3 s-1 for Lys-plasminogen. In the systems with fibrin, plasmin was estimated from the rate of release of 125I from 125I-labeled fibrin films. The initial rate of activation (v) was calculated and Lineweaver-Burk plots of 1/v versus 1/[P] or 1/v versus 1/[F] yielded straight lines. Activation occurred with an intrinsic Michaelis constant of 0.16 microM and a catalytic rate constant of 0.1 s-1 for Glu-plasminogen as compared to 0.02 microM and 0.2 s-1 for Lys-plasminogen. The kinetic analysis suggested that the activation in the presence of fibrin occurs through binding of an activator molecule to the clot surface and subsequent addition of plasminogen (sequential ordered mechanism) to form a cyclic ternary complex. The Low Michaelis constant in the presence of fibrin allows efficient plasminogen activation on a fibrin clot, while its high value in the absence of fibrin prevents efficient activation in plasma."
https://openalex.org/W1895492779,"Islet-activating protein (IAP), one of the pertussis toxins, exerted dual actions on crude membrane preparations from rat C6 glioma cells; an Mr = 41,000 membrane protein was ADP-ribosylated while GTP (and GTP-dependent isoproterenol) activation of membrane adenylate cyclase was enhanced when membranes were incubated with IaP. Both actions of IaP were dependent on the incubation time and the concentrations of NAD and IAP, and were inhibited by nicotinamide; the one action was strictly paralleled by the other in magnitude. Tryptic digestion of the Mr = 41,000 protein was markedly influenced by the presence of guanyl-5'-yl beta-gamma-imidodiphosphate or NaF, the specific ligands of the regulatory component of the adenylate cyclase system. No ADP ribosylation occurred in the membranes prepared from intact C6 cells that had been incubated with IAP, suggesting that the IAP substrate had already been ADP-ribosylated by the intracellular NAD during incubation of the intact cells. Cholera toxin catalyzed ADP ribosylation of other proteins with Mr = 45,000 and 48,000/49,000 (doublet). It is concluded that IAP, added to intact cells or isolated membranes, causes unique modification of the receptor-adenylate cyclase coupling mechanism as a result of ADP ribosylation of the Mr = 41,000 protein which is presumably one of the subunits, other than the cholera toxin substrates, of the guanine nucleotide regulatory component of the cyclase system."

https://openalex.org/W2031970793,"Mice exposed to repeated attacks by other mice showed decreased nociception in response to radiant heat focused on their tails. This form of analgesia was blocked by centrally acting opiate antagonists and was not observed in morphine-tolerant mice; furthermore, mice repeatedly subjected to defeat. Mice of the CXBK strain, which respond weakly to morphine, displayed only moderate analgesia following defeat. These findings suggest that endogenous opioid-mediated analgesic mechanisms are readily activated by situations involving biologically significant forms of stress, such as defeat."

https://openalex.org/W1525169050,"The 68,000, 145,000, and 200,000 dalton subunits of neurofilaments from rat spinal cord and brain stem were shown by chemical phosphate analysis to contain about 3, 9, and 22 mol of phosphate/mol of polypeptide, respectively. All three subunits contained phosphoserine while the 145,000 dalton polypeptide also contained phosphothreonine. The high phosphate content of the 200,000 dalton polypeptide was reflected by the extensive shifts both in its isoelectric point and apparent molecular weight after treatment of neurofilaments with alkaline phosphatase."
https://openalex.org/W2041383836,"Histone synthesis in cycling tissue-culture cells can be separated into basal synthesis and S-phase synthesis. S-phase histone synthesis comprises about 90% of total histone synthesis, and in this regard our results support the generally held model that most histone synthesis is tightly linked to DNA synthesis. Basal histone synthesis is less than 10% of the S-phase synthesis but persists throughout the S, G2 and G1 phases of the cell cycle, while S-phase synthesis rises in parallel with the increase in DNA synthesis. In Chinese hamster ovary cells, the H2A variants Z and X, and the H3 variant 3, participate in basal histone synthesis while the H2A variants 1 and 2, and the H3 variant 2, participate in S-phase histone synthesis. H2B and H4 participate in both kinds of synthesis. Because specific H2A and H3 variants are involved, basal histone synthesis cannot be attributed to contamination by cells in S-phase. Whole cells and isolated nuclei yield the same results. Basal histone synthesis can be demonstrated in cells synchronized by mitotic shake-off either alone or in combination with isoleucine starvation and colcemid blockage. It is also differentiated from S-phase histone synthesis by its relative insensitivity to hydroxyurea, indicating that basal histone synthesis is not linked or is at least less tightly linked to DNA synthesis. The basal H2A variants X and Z of five other cell lines all show similar relative insensitivities to hydroxyurea treatment. These lines include attached cultures, suspension cultures, a normal line and transformed lines from human, mouse, rat and Chinese hamster, indicating that basal histone synthesis may be a property of all cycling cells. The integration of basal histones into chromatin seems to follow the same pathway as S-phase histones, but the kinetics are somewhat slower."

Results of animal experiments performed to evaluate this model suggest that conditioned drug-anticipatory responses, in addition to pharmacological factors, affect heroin-induced mortality."
https://openalex.org/W1999933913,"A high molecular weight protein from the brush border of chicken intestinal epithelial cells has been purified. This protein (TW 260/240), a complex of two polypeptides with apparent molecular weights of 260,000 and 240,000, accounts for a significant amount of the terminal web organization. TW 260/240 is an F-actin-binding protein that also interacts with calmodulin. Rotary shadowing reveals long flexible rods of double-stranded morphology tightly connected at each end. TW 260/240 is quite distinct from smooth muscle filamin and macrophage actin-binding protein (APB), but, in spite of its higher contour length (265 nm), seems to be related to erythrocyte spectrin (194 nm for the tetramer). Immunofluorescence microscopy with antibodies against TW 260/240 indicates the existence of a submembranous organization distinctly different from that of stress fibers. We have compared TW 260/240 with fodrin, a brain protein known to occur in submembranous organization but not previously characterized in molecular terms. TW 260/240 and fodrin are clearly distinct molecules but are similar in many aspects. Ultrastructural, biochemical and immunological results indicate three distinct classes of rod-like high molecular weight actin-binding proteins, possibly reflected by the prototypes filamin (ABP), spectrin and TW 260/240 (fodrin). The latter group may be responsible for calmodulin control of submembranous microfilament structures in various nonmuscle cells."

https://openalex.org/W2038458953,"Rats experienced inescapable, escapable, or no electric shock 1 day after being implanted with a Walker 256 tumor preparation. Only 27 percent of the rats receiving inescapable shock rejected the tumor, whereas 63 percent of the rats receiving escapable shock and 54 percent of the rats receiving no shock rejected the tumor. These results imply that lack of control over stressors reduces tumor rejection and decreases survival."
https://openalex.org/W1981436766,"In target tissues for estrogen, including breast cancer cells, the synthesis of progesterone receptors (PRs) is controlled by estradiol acting through estrogen receptors (ERs). We describe studies with T47D human breast cancer cells, whose PRs are not regulated by estradiol, though present in extraordinary amounts (300,000 sites per cell). These cells have no ERs sedimenting at 8S on sucrose density gradients, and no unfilled cytoplasmic or nuclear ERs; some apparently hormone-filled nuclear sites, with nM, can be demonstrated by exchange. The nuclear ER sites are not processed after estradiol treatment. Nafoxidine, however, doubles nuclear estrogen binding in 6 hr, in a cycloheximide-insensitive step that may represent a reversal of processing. T47D cells are profoundly resistant to estrogens and antiestrogens; estradiol does not stimulate PRs, and nafoxidine concentrations that are cytotoxic to ER-positive cells have no effect on cell growth or on PR levels. Yet the PRs are normal by several criteria, and they can be stoichiometrically translocated to, and extracted from, nuclei in the first 3 min after progesterone addition. If progesterone treatment exceeds 10 min, rapid nuclear turnover prevents quantitative PR recovery. Cytoplasmic PRs are replenished in 10 to 24 hr, and this cycloheximide-sensitive step is also estrogen- and nafoxidine-resistant. However, despite their insensitivity to estradiol or antiestrogen, PRs are not constitutively synthesized; 5-bromodeoxyuridine and sodium butyrate can selectively inhibit PR production. Thus, since PRs retain some characteristics of inducible proteins, the persistent nuclear estrogen-binding sites may be stimulating PRs continuously, even in the absence of exogenous estradiol."

https://openalex.org/W2043720672,"The principles of the measurement in vivo of the oxidation-reduction state of intramitochrondrial pyridine nucleotides were used in establishing a multichannel fluorometer-reflectometer. This approach made possible the study of changes of mitochrondrial redox states in four different organs (brain, liver, kidney, and testis) of the same animal, as well as the monitoring of four different cortical areas of the same brain hemisphere. In the measurement of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide fluorescence, oximetric and movement artifacts are negligible, but blood volume changes and tissue absorption properties are a source of error. The corrected fluorescence is obtained by subtracting the reflectance from the fluorescence signed in 1:1 ratio., During graded hypoxia, the corrected fluorescence showed a gradual increase and was maximal during anoxia in all four organs tested."
https://openalex.org/W2088283955,"High-resolution gamma camera images of mouse erythroid tumors were obtained by use of leukemia cell-specific monoclonal antibodies labeled with bifunctional radioactive metal chelates. Small tumors (200 to 300 milligrams) were visible without subtraction or enhancement 1 to 5 hours after injection of antibody. Chelate-derivitized monoclonal antibodies permit targeting of a broad spectrum of radioisotopes, including those that are optimum for agamma for gamma camera imaging or positron tomography, as well as those that are tumoricidal."

https://openalex.org/W2035627599,"We have studied the requirements for the in vitro assembly of transcriptionally active 5S RNA gene chromatin from cloned Xenopus laevis 5S plasmid DNA. Both plasmid DNA and DNA assembled into chromatin with Xenopus oocyte extracts are transcribed efficiently in vitro. Chromatin prepared by NaCl reconstitution with purified histones in the absence of any cellular factors, however, is transcriptionally inert. A transcriptionally active template is formed if plasmid DNA is incubated in an ovary extract prior to, but not after, NaCl reconstitution. The cellular component responsible for this effect is the 5S RNA transcription factor TFIIIA. Both chromatographically purified TFIIIA and TFIIIA derived from 7S RNP particles can complex with 5S DNA to yield an active chromatin template upon reconstitution with histones. This effect is specific for 5S RNA genes, since TFIIIA will not form an active template when incubated with a cloned Bombyx mori alanine tRNA gene."

https://openalex.org/W1500843066,"The phosphate content of neurofilaments from bovine spinal cord and of their constituent polypeptides was determined. Neurofilament preparations, as isolated, contained substantial amounts of phosphate, having between 65 and 98 nmol of phosphate/mg of protein. When the polypeptides of the neurofilament were assayed for phosphate individually, the 210,000-and 160,000-dalton polypeptides were found to possess large numbers of phosphate groups, while the 68,000-dalton polypeptide had less than 1 mol of phosphate/mol of polypeptide. The 210,000-dalton polypeptide had about 104 mol of phosphate bound/mol of polypeptide, and the 160,000-dalton polypeptide had about 26 mol of phosphate/mol of polypeptide. This distribution of phosphate among the polypeptides of the neurofilament preparation was qualitatively confirmed when sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels of the preparations were stained for phosphate. Bands corresponding to the 210,000- and 160,000-dalton polypeptides were readily detected. No other phosphate-stained bands were seen, even on heavily loaded gels."
https://openalex.org/W2077947679,"The Xenopus oocyte was used to study translation, stability and subcellular compartmentation of injected heterologous mRNAs. The capacity of the oocyte to translate a membrane-free mRNA, globin, was not saturable by amounts up to 100 ng injected. In contrast, the ability of the oocyte to translate a membrane-associated mRNA, zein, saturated at 20 ng or less of injected mRNA. The hybridization of RNA from message-injected oocytes to cDNA probes revealed that approximately the same amount of globin and zein mRNAs remained stable and that this fraction was as little as 2.1% at the highest amount injected (80 ng). However, while almost all of the globin mRNA at all concentrations injected was found in a polysome pellet, most of the zein mRNA at saturating concentrations was found in a post-polysomal supernatant. The reason for the limited translation of zein mRNA appears to be due to a paucity of oocyte rough endoplasmic reticulum since the injection of dog pancreas rough endoplasmic reticulum into oocytes previously injected with zein mRNA stimulates zein synthesis. Displacement and competition experiments between four different mRNAs indicate that injected messages are distributed to two translational compartments, membrane-bound and free, and that this occurs either prior to the initiation of translation or involves message-specific factors."
https://openalex.org/W1481157419,"[3H]Cytochalasin B was found to be a natural photoaffinity ligand which at low concentrations could be photoincorporated into specific proteins of the human erythrocyte plasma membrane associated with high affinity binding sites of this molecule. In the presence of L-glucose, the polypeptide region referred to as zone 4.5 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoretograms was photolabeled with [3H]cytochalasin B. At least two major peaks could be resolved in this region, one at approximately 50,000 daltons and the other at approximately 47,000 daltons. In addition, this incorporation was partially blocked when D-glucose was substituted for L-glucose in these experiments. Incorporation was time-dependent upon photolysis, did not occur in the absence of light, and was not reversible under the harsh conditions of gel electrophoresis. This suggests a covalent incorporation of this ligand into polypeptides previously identified as being associated with monosaccharide transport in these cells. In addition, soluble G-actin from muscle was labeled, but at a level 100-fold lower than transporter polypeptides. These experiments suggest that this technique may prove useful in identifying monosaccharide transporter proteins in other cell systems as well as other types of cellular proteins associated with high affinity cytochalasin binding."
https://openalex.org/W1680189526,"The extracellular polysaccharide produced by the bacterium Rhizobium japonicum has been implicated in the recognition between symbionts which takes place in the association of R. japonicum with soybean. The complete primary structure of the polysaccharide produced by R. japonicum strain 3I1b 138 has been determined by a combination of conventional and unconventional methods. The polymer contains glucose, mannose, and galacturonic acid in the molar ratio of 2:1:1 and contains a varying proportion of galactose and 4-O-methylgalactose, the sum of these two being equivalent to the amount of mannose (Mort, A. J., and Bauer, W. D. (1980) Plant Physiol, 66, 158-163). The polymer was specifically degraded and its galacturonic acid residues by treatment with lithium in ethylenediamine to a tetrasaccharide. By sequential specific glycosidase hydrolysis and methylation analysis the tetrasaccharide was shown to have Structure 1: (formula: see text). Anhydrous liquid hydrogen fluoride at -23 degrees C degraded the polymer to a trisaccharide and monosaccharides. The galactose and 4-O-methylgalactose released by the HF as monosaccharides were found to be partially acetylated. By 1H NMR spectrometry and methylation analysis the trisaccharide was found to have Structure 2: (formula: see text). From the composition and the structural analyses of the tetra- and trisaccharides produced in high yields by specific degradations of the polysaccharide, the polymer is deduced to have a pentasaccharide repeating unit with Structure 3: (formula: see text)."
https://openalex.org/W2051313430,"The concentrations of oxytocin, arginine vasopressin, and estrogen stimulated neurophysin in cerebrospinal fluid of monkeys showed a daily fluctuation with high concentrations occurring during the light period. The patterns of oxytocin and estrogen-stimulated neurophysin in the cerebrospinal fluid were not observed in the plasma nor were they altered after the administration of a dose of estradiol that increased concentrations of estrogen-stimulated neurophysin in plasma. The disassociation between these cerebrospinal fluid and plasma patterns and values suggests that the secretory activity of neurons that release estrogen-stimulated neurophysin and oxytocin into the cerebrospinal fluid is controlled by mechanisms different from those that control their release into the plasma."
https://openalex.org/W2088083949,"Treatment of cultured human diploid fibroblasts with a chemical carcinogen produced a clonal neoplastic cell line (HUT-14) that expresses a mutant β actin, nearly an equal amount of normal β actin and one additional nonmuscle actin species, γ actin. These three actins are the principal structural components of the detergent-resistant cytoskeleton. A substrain of HUT-14 was derived from a tumor produced by inoculation of a nude mouse with a highly selected subclone of HUT-14 cells. Cells of this new substrain, HUT-14T, exhibit a more variant distribution of cytoskeletal actin than the parent HUT-14 strain and a further diminution in cytoskeletal fibronectin. HUT-14T is also elevated in tumorigenicity, producing larger, faster-growing fibrosarcomas in the nude mouse than the parent HUT-14 strain with fewer inoculated cells. These phenotypic cellular changes accompany a biochemical and functional change in the mutant β-actin polypeptide. The more variant mutant actin of HUT-14T differs from the original mutant polypeptide by: one additional negative net charge, a short half-life in the cell, a greatly diminished ability to incorporate into the detergent-resistant cytoskeleton, a decrease in affinity for deoxyribonuclease I and a faster rate of synthesis. It appears that the mutant actin of HUT-14 acquired a second-site mutation that was selected during a subcloning step prior to derivation of the HUT-14T substrain. The hypothesis of a second-site mutation is supported by the finding that the new β-actin species in HUT-14T cells is translated correctly from HUT-14T mRNA in vitro. The increased rate of synthesis of mutant β actin in HUT-14T cells is accompanied by an approximate doubling in the relative amount of translatable mutant β-actin mRNA, an event that occurred separately from the event that produced the altered mutant β actin. These separate variations in β-actin expression are accompanied by incremental increases of malignant potential in this cell line."
https://openalex.org/W2065311383,"The sexual behavior of rhesus monkeys in 15 male-female pairings was observed in both a large and a small area during the follicular and luteal phases of the female's cycle. Males ejaculated in all tests at the follicular phase of the female's cycle and in 53 percent of tests at the luteal phase. However, a significant decline in ejaculation during tests at the luteal phase occurred in the large, but not in the small area. Thus the degree to which the pair's sexual behavior was influenced by the female's hormonal state depended on the spatial conditions of the test."

https://openalex.org/W2139658501,"Co-sonicated mixtures of egg phosphatidylcholine and small amounts (less than or equal to 4%, w/w) of [carbonyl-13C]cholesteryl oleate have been studied by 13C NMR spectroscopy at 50.3 MHz. The carbonyl chemical shift from cholesteryl oleate solubilized in vesicles was 1 ppm downfield from the carbonyl chemical shift of cholesteryl oleate present in a separate oil phase. The maximum solubility of the steroid in vesicles determined by chemical analysis of purified vesicles was 1.6 weight % (approximately 2 mol %), in close agreement with the maximum solubility estimated from NMR speak intensity measurements (1.4 weight %). The downfield shift indicates hydrogen bonding of solvent (H2O) molecules with the cholesteryl oleate carbonyl group, suggesting that vesicle-solubilized cholesteryl oleate molecules are located in the phospholipid bilayer with the carbonyl group close to the aqueous interface and the sterol ring and fatty acyl chain approximately parallel to the fatty acyl chains of the phospholipid. Such a folded conformation and localization of the carbonyl group at the aqueous interface may facilitate interactions of sterol esters with cholesterol ester transfer proteins and cholesterol esterases."
https://openalex.org/W2059063721,"The larva of the blowfly Cochliomyia hominivorax, also known as the screwworm, eats the living flesh of cattle and sheep and other warm-blooded animals. A program to eradicate the screwworm in the United States was initiated in the 1950's. The program was very effective until 1968, but severe screwworm outbreaks occurred in 1972 to 1976 and in 1978. Although the program has again been effective since 1979, the possibility of outbreaks recurring in the future has highlighted the need for a broader understanding of the pest. Studies of screwworm populations in the United Stated and Mexico indicate that much of the genetic diversity of this insect is distributed among sympatric non-interbreeding populations. A new approach may be required to retain the effectiveness of the control program and to prevent a serious outbreak from threatening the economic viability of the U.S. livestock industry."

https://openalex.org/W1573881834,"Studies were conducted to explore the role of retinol in the control of the rate of synthesis of plasma retinol-binding protein (RBP) in the liver of the rat. Previous studies have shown that nutritional retinol status strongly influences RBP secretion from the liver cell. Both the in vivo relative rate of RBP synthesis and the in vitro translatable level of RBP-specific mRNA were examined in normal vitamin A, retinol-depleted, and retinol-repleted rats. The relative rate of RBP synthesis was estimated by measuring the extent of incorporation of [3H]leucine, [3H]lysine, and [3H]phenylalanine after a 12-min pulse label into immunoprecipitable RBP, relative to the incorporation of these amino acids into total liver trichloroacetic acid-precipitable protein. The level of translatable RBP-specific mRNA was quantitated in vitro by translation of rat liver poly(A+)RNA in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate protein-synthesizing system. The amount of newly synthesized RBP was determined relative to the amount of newly synthesized total protein. Both the relative rate of RBP synthesis (approximately 0.26%) and the translatable level of RBP-specific mRNA (approximately 0.14%) were found to be constant regardless of the retinol status of the rats. These results indicate that retinol, the molecule that RBP specifically binds and transports, does not appear to control the rate of synthesis of RBP or the translatable level of RBP-specific mRNA in the liver of the rat. Regulation of plasma RBP levels by retinol must be exercised at a locus beyond that of RBP synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1481204726,"We have previously demonstrated that neurofilament protein (NFP) is endogenously phosphorylated in squid giant fiber axoplasm (1).

Phosphorylation of guinea pig NFP is shown in extracts of peripheral nerve and in enriched NFP preparations. Both Myxicola NFP subunits (150 and 160 kilodaltons) and all three guinea pig NFP subunits (200, 145, and 68 kilodaltons) are phosphorylated. Phosphorylation of 10-nm filament protein from cultured fibroblasts is also shown optimal reaction conditions with guinea pig enriched NFP are as follows. The reaction has high specificity for ATP as substrate. Divalent cations are required, Mn2+ being most effective. Monovalent cations decrease activity. The pH optimum is 8.0.

https://openalex.org/W1500988404,"Calcium uptake and molecular ordering were studied in hepatic microsomes from rats treated chronically with ethanol and were compared with the effects of ethanol in vitro. Calcium uptake was increased by 30% in microsomes from ethanol-fed animals, the Vmax being increased and the Km remaining unchanged. In Arrhenius plots of calcium uptake, the transition temperature in the 25-30 degrees C range was higher by 1.5 degrees C in microsomes from ethanol-fed rats. Chronic ethanol administration resulted in more rigid microsomal membranes, as evidenced by EPR spectra of the spin probe 5-doxylstearic acid. In a plot of the order parameter, S, as a function of temperature, microsomes from ethanol-fed rats showed a discontinuity at a higher temperature than those from controls (29.9 versus 24.2 degrees C). Ethanol, in vitro, inhibited microsomal calcium uptake in both preparations. However, the degree of inhibition was greater in controls. The rate of calcium uptake by microsomes from ethanol-treated animals in the presence of 100 mM ethanol was the same as those from controls in the absence of ethanol. In vitro, increasing concentrations of ethanol progressively decreased molecular ordering of control microsomes, whereas little change was noted in microsomes after chronic ethanol treatment."

https://openalex.org/W1652388671,"Gel chromatography experiments over a wide range of protein concentrations showed that Chlorella nitrate reductase is a nonassociating protein with a Stokes radius of 81 A. Sedimentation equilibrium of nitrate reductase in H2O-D2O solvents yielded a partial specific volume of 0.800 +/- 0.014 (n = 12) and a Mr = 360,000 +/- 25,000. No lipid was found associated with nitrate reductase. Cross-linking with the bifunctional reagent, dimethyl suberimidate, and subsequent separation of products by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis yielded four protein-staining bands in which the molecular weights of the cross-linked products were integral multiples of the monomeric molecular weight (90,000). Extensive cross-linking of the enzyme resulted in one principal protein-staining band of 360,000, corresponding to a tetramer. The cross-linked tetramer of nitrate reductase appeared to have identical physical properties as the native enzyme. The cross-linking pattern produced by reaction with dimethyl suberimidate suggested that nitrate reductase is an isologous tetramer which has at least two different types of bonding domains. Gel filtration, sedimentation equilibrium, and density gradient experiments at very low enzyme concentrations indicated that nitrate reductase dissociates to a species with a Stokes radius of 54 A, s20.w of 7.1, and Mr = approximately 200,000 at these low enzyme concentrations. No change in specific activity of the enzyme was observed over this concentration range. Treatment of nitrate reductase with trypsin or with cyanogen bromide yielded the number of peptides expected for identical subunits. From these results, it is concluded that Chlorella nitrate reductase is a homotetramer with dihedral symmetry (dimer of dimers)."

An overall purification of greater than 3000-fold was achieved with a recovery of 32%. This purified material was shown to possess the following physical characteristics: an equilibrium dissociation constant at 4 degrees C for dihydrotestosterone estimated to be 0.59 X 10(-9) M and a half-time of dissociation of rbTeBG-dihydrotestosterone complex of approximately 9 min at 4 degrees C. The purified protein shows considerable microheterogeneity with regard to size on sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and to charge on isoelectric focusing gels. Analytical gel electrophoresis in the presence of SDS revealed two molecular weight components of 41,000 and 45,000. Size analysis on native gels and cross-linking studies yields a molecular weight of 101,600 and 83,000, respectively. These size components were shown to be very closely related with regard to primary structure. rbTeBG was completely absorbed by concanavalin A Sepharose resin, demonstrating the glycoprotein nature of rbTeBG. Highly purified rbTeBG and unpurified rbTeBG from rabbit plasma could be photolabeled with [3H]delta 6-testosterone and when analyzed on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), two major bands of radioactivity with molecular weights of 41,000 and 45,000 appeared in both samples."

Studies of cats show that the discharge of motoneurons causing this contraction has all the characteristics of a flexor reflex."
https://openalex.org/W1987316259,"Recent studies suggest that control of daily light exposure regulates reproduction, stimulates body growth, and increases the efficiency of feed utilization and egg and milk yields in several domestic species used for food. Hormones mediate photoperiod-induced changes in these traits. Photoperiod manipulation is a promising method of increasing food production from domestic animals."

https://openalex.org/W2054575633,"Mice infected with Trypanosoma rhodesiense were treated concurrently with cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (II) (DDP), disulfiram, and hydration. Most of the mice (92.5 percent) were cured; inoculation of blood or suspensions of brain or heart from these animals did not produce disease in recipient mice. The dose of DDP needed to eliminate the trypanosomes, 3 milligrams per kilogram of body weight per day for 7 days, was lethally toxic unless the animals received disulfiram orally and subcutaneous injections of physiologic saline, which reduced the acute renal necrosis caused by DDP alone. Some mild to moderate reversible renal damage was noted upon pathologic examination of the treated mice."
https://openalex.org/W1531726048,"The messenger RNA species that code for two extra-embryonic endodermal cytoskeletal proteins (Endo A and Endo B) have been identified. Endo A and Endo B messenger RNA species are differentially expressed. They are absent, or at basal levels, in undifferentiated embryonal carcinoma cells (F9.22 cell line) and relatively abundant in parietal endoderm (PFHR9 cell line) or in embryonal carcinoma cells that have been induced, by retinoid acid, to differentiate to parietal endoderm. Endo A and Endo B messenger RNA can be detected in F9.22 cells 48 to 72 h after exposure to retinoic acid, which is coincident with the expression of Endo A and Endo B proteins. The size of Endo A and Endo B messenger RNA has been determined by denaturing methyl mercury hydroxide agarose gels to be 2.0 +/- 0.1 and 1.5 +/- 0.2 kilobases, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1560772135,"Abstract A proline-rich polypeptide is associated with prostatic binding protein, a major androgen-dependent protein described previously in the rat ventral prostate. This polypeptide has been purified. Its molecular weight estimated by gel filtration is about 8500, but a markedly lower value (3300) is obtained by sodium dodecyl sulfate-urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Isoelectric focusing on thin layer polyacrylamide gels yields two major forms with isoelectric points of, respectively, 7.75 and 7.05. The amino acid composition of proline-rich polypeptide is characterized by a high (19.5%) proline content and its NH2-terminal amino acid is glycine. Like prostatic binding protein, proline-rich polypeptide is a characteristic component of the rat ventral prostate and localized primarily in the intraluminal secretion of this gland. In intact adult male rats the cytosol of a whole gland contains 0.70 +/- 0.15 (S.D.) mg of the polypeptide, as measured by radial immunodiffusion or 2.6 +/- 0.5% of (S.D.) of the total protein. This amount decreases gradually after castration and becomes undetectable after 8 days. Androgen treatment, on the other hand, results in a rapid stimulation, while estradiol and progesterone are ineffective. Proline-rich polypeptide is markedly more androgen-dependent than prostatic binding protein, and promises to be an interesting end point for studies on the mechanism of action of androgens."
https://openalex.org/W1594696723,"The glucose transporter of human erythrocytes was reconstituted with soybean phospholipids by the freeze-thaw/sonication method and the distribution of the transporter molecules in liposomes was studied. The steady state level of glucose transport in reconstituted liposomes showed saturation when increased amounts of the transporter were used for reconstitution. The saturation curve fitted well to a theoretical curve which was derived assuming a Poisson distribution of the transporter. Freeze-fracture electron micrographs showed random distribution of intramembraneous particles on liposomes, irrespective of liposome size or amount of the transporter added. A detailed study showed a parameter of the distribution (the ratio of transporter to liposome) obtained from the transport measurement can be used for the analysis of the distribution of intramembraneous particles, indicating that most of the molecules seen as particles were active in transport."
