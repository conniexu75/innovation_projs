https://openalex.org/W2986820495,"Fruit characteristics of sweet watermelon are largely the result of human selection. Here we report an improved watermelon reference genome and whole-genome resequencing of 414 accessions representing all extant species in the Citrullus genus. Population genomic analyses reveal the evolutionary history of Citrullus, suggesting independent evolutions in Citrullus amarus and the lineage containing Citrullus lanatus and Citrullus mucosospermus. Our findings indicate that different loci affecting watermelon fruit size have been under selection during speciation, domestication and improvement. A non-bitter allele, arising in the progenitor of sweet watermelon, is largely fixed in C. lanatus. Selection for flesh sweetness started in the progenitor of C. lanatus and continues through modern breeding on loci controlling raffinose catabolism and sugar transport. Fruit flesh coloration and sugar accumulation might have co-evolved through shared genetic components including a sugar transporter gene. This study provides valuable genomic resources and sheds light on watermelon speciation and breeding history."
https://openalex.org/W2986919234,"Volumetric variations of the human brain are heritable and are associated with many brain-related complex traits. Here we performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of 101 brain volumetric phenotypes using the UK Biobank sample including 19,629 participants. GWAS identified 365 independent genetic variants exceeding a significance threshold of 4.9 × 10-10, adjusted for testing multiple phenotypes. A gene-based association study found 157 associated genes (124 new), and functional gene mapping analysis linked 146 additional genes. Many of the discovered genetic variants and genes have previously been implicated in cognitive and mental health traits. Through genome-wide polygenic-risk-score prediction, more than 6% of the phenotypic variance (P = 3.13 × 10-24) in four other independent studies could be explained by the UK Biobank GWAS results. In conclusion, our study identifies many new genetic associations at the variant, locus and gene levels and advances our understanding of the pleiotropy and genetic co-architecture between brain volumes and other traits."
https://openalex.org/W2981754575,"Genomic studies in African populations provide unique opportunities to understand disease etiology, human diversity, and population history. In the largest study of its kind, comprising genome-wide data from 6,400 individuals and whole-genome sequences from 1,978 individuals from rural Uganda, we find evidence of geographically correlated fine-scale population substructure. Historically, the ancestry of modern Ugandans was best represented by a mixture of ancient East African pastoralists. We demonstrate the value of the largest sequence panel from Africa to date as an imputation resource. Examining 34 cardiometabolic traits, we show systematic differences in trait heritability between European and African populations, probably reflecting the differential impact of genes and environment. In a multi-trait pan-African GWAS of up to 14,126 individuals, we identify novel loci associated with anthropometric, hematological, lipid, and glycemic traits. We find that several functionally important signals are driven by Africa-specific variants, highlighting the value of studying diverse populations across the region."
https://openalex.org/W2986831010,"Venous thromboembolism is a significant cause of mortality1, yet its genetic determinants are incompletely defined. We performed a discovery genome-wide association study in the Million Veteran Program and UK Biobank, with testing of approximately 13 million DNA sequence variants for association with venous thromboembolism (26,066 cases and 624,053 controls) and meta-analyzed both studies, followed by independent replication with up to 17,672 venous thromboembolism cases and 167,295 controls. We identified 22 previously unknown loci, bringing the total number of venous thromboembolism-associated loci to 33, and subsequently fine-mapped these associations. We developed a genome-wide polygenic risk score for venous thromboembolism that identifies 5% of the population at an equivalent incident venous thromboembolism risk to carriers of the established factor V Leiden p.R506Q and prothrombin G20210A mutations. Our data provide mechanistic insights into the genetic epidemiology of venous thromboembolism and suggest a greater overlap among venous and arterial cardiovascular disease than previously thought."
https://openalex.org/W2988655273,"Short tandem repeats (STRs) have been implicated in a variety of complex traits in humans. However, genome-wide studies of the effects of STRs on gene expression thus far have had limited power to detect associations and provide insights into putative mechanisms. Here, we leverage whole-genome sequencing and expression data for 17 tissues from the Genotype-Tissue Expression Project to identify more than 28,000 STRs for which repeat number is associated with expression of nearby genes (eSTRs). We use fine-mapping to quantify the probability that each eSTR is causal and characterize the top 1,400 fine-mapped eSTRs. We identify hundreds of eSTRs linked with published genome-wide association study signals and implicate specific eSTRs in complex traits, including height, schizophrenia, inflammatory bowel disease and intelligence. Overall, our results support the hypothesis that eSTRs contribute to a range of human phenotypes, and our data should serve as a valuable resource for future studies of complex traits."
https://openalex.org/W2983365927,"Melon is an economically important fruit crop that has been cultivated for thousands of years; however, the genetic basis and history of its domestication still remain largely unknown. Here we report a comprehensive map of the genomic variation in melon derived from the resequencing of 1,175 accessions, which represent the global diversity of the species. Our results suggest that three independent domestication events occurred in melon, two in India and one in Africa. We detected two independent sets of domestication sweeps, resulting in diverse characteristics of the two subspecies melo and agrestis during melon breeding. Genome-wide association studies for 16 agronomic traits identified 208 loci significantly associated with fruit mass, quality and morphological characters. This study sheds light on the domestication history of melon and provides a valuable resource for genomics-assisted breeding of this important crop."

Hippocampal place cells replay spatial paths during immobility in reverse and forward order, offering a potential mechanism. However, how replay supports both goal-directed learning and memory-guided decision making is unclear. We therefore continuously tracked awake replay in the same hippocampal-prefrontal ensembles throughout learning of a spatial alternation task. We found that, during pauses between behavioral trajectories, reverse and forward hippocampal replay supports an internal cognitive search of available past and future possibilities and exhibits opposing learning gradients for prediction of past and future behavioral paths, respectively. Coordinated hippocampal-prefrontal replay distinguished correct past and future paths from alternative choices, suggesting a role in recall of past paths to guide planning of future decisions for spatial working memory. Our findings reveal a learning shift from hippocampal reverse-replay-based retrospective evaluation to forward-replay-based prospective planning, with prefrontal readout of memory-guided paths for learning and decision making.

Our findings reveal a learning shift from hippocampal reverse-replay-based retrospective evaluation to forward-replay-based prospective planning, with prefrontal readout of memory-guided paths for learning and decision making. The hippocampus is necessary for formation and retrieval of episodic memories to guide daily behavior, including goal-directed spatial learning and navigation (Eichenbaum and Cohen, 2004Eichenbaum H. Cohen N.J. From Conditioning to Conscious Recollection: Memory Systems of the Brain. Oxford University Press, 2004Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar, Squire, 1992Squire L.R. Memory and the hippocampus: a synthesis from findings with rats, monkeys, and humans.Psychol. Rev. 1992; 99: 195-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (4106) Google Scholar). Hippocampal place cells are active in specific spatial locations during exploration (O’Keefe and Nadel, 1978O’Keefe J. Nadel L. The hippocampus as a cognitive map. Oxford University Press, 1978Google Scholar). While this spatial code provides information about current location, spatial memories require learning links between sequences of locations that encode specific paths and choices that lead to goals, which is likely to be supported by another phenomenon called “replay”. Hippocampal replay is associated with high-frequency sharp-wave ripple (SWR) events prevalent during offline periods in both sleep and non-exploratory waking states (“awake replay”) (Buzsáki, 2015Buzsáki G. Hippocampal sharp wave-ripple: A cognitive biomarker for episodic memory and planning.Hippocampus. 2015; 25: 1073-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). During replay, temporally compressed sequences of place cells reactivate spatial trajectories in explored environments in either forward or reverse order (Ambrose et al., 2016Ambrose R.E.

Notably, while sleep replay is associated with offline memory consolidation, awake replay during pauses in exploration is ideally suited to support processes associated with ongoing memory-guided behavior, including retrospection, retrieval, prospection, and planning (Carr et al., 2011Carr M.F.

In rodents, awake reverse and forward replay represents behavioral trajectories in spatial environments (Ambrose et al., 2016Ambrose R.E. Pfeiffer B.E. Foster D.J.

Several reported features of hippocampal awake replay are suggestive of its functional roles. First, replay is enhanced by reward and novelty (Ambrose et al., 2016Ambrose R.E. Pfeiffer B.E.

Replay comes of age.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2017; 40: 581-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, Foster and Knierim, 2012Foster D.J. Knierim J.J.

Recurrent network model for learning goal-directed sequences through reverse replay.eLife. 2018; 7: e34171Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Additionally, replay is hypothesized to support memory retrieval for planning upcoming choices (Carr et al., 2011Carr M.F. Jadhav S.P. Frank L.M.

Neurosci. 2011; 14: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, Singer et al., 2013Singer A.C. Carr M.F. Karlsson M.P. Frank L.M. Hippocampal SWR activity predicts correct decisions during the initial learning of an alternation task.Neuron. 2013; 77: 1163-1173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar)—there is evidence that replay is involved in fear memory retrieval (Wu et al., 2017Wu C.-T. Haggerty D. Kemere C. Ji D. Hippocampal awake replay in fear memory retrieval.Nat. Neurosci. 2017; 20: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and specifically forward replay is associated with planning of future trajectories (Pfeiffer and Foster, 2013Pfeiffer B.E.

Further, awake replay can represent random (Gupta et al., 2010Gupta A.S. van der Meer M.A. Touretzky D.S. Redish A.D. Hippocampal replay is not a simple function of experience.Neuron. 2010; 65: 695-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, Stella et al., 2019Stella F. Baracskay P.

Frank L.M. Awake replay of remote experiences in the hippocampus.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 913-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar), suggesting a role in free recall. In agreement with rodent studies, recent evidence identifies an analogous role of human and primate awake replay in cognitive processing (Leonard and Hoffman, 2017Leonard T.K. Hoffman K.L.

Despite this mounting evidence, how reverse and forward replay together support the proposed roles in learning, retrieval, and memory-guided decision making remains unclear. Further, whether and how replay content changes over the course of learning to support memory-guided choices is not known. Addressing these questions requires monitoring the evolution of replay content in the same neural populations over the entire duration of learning. In addition, it is hypothesized that hippocampal replay of behavioral paths may contribute to a cognitive search process based on previous experience, which can influence target regions (Joo and Frank, 2018Joo H.R.

Indeed, goal-directed behavior relies on a wider neural network for evaluation and selection of task-relevant memories during retrieval and decision making, and the cognitive processes of learning, deliberation, and spatial navigation are known to require the prefrontal cortex (PFC; Eichenbaum, 2017Eichenbaum H.

Mem. 2015; 117: 34-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). How hippocampal and PFC networks together support learning and planning, especially for replay-dependent working memory tasks, remains an open question. Hippocampal-prefrontal (area CA1-PFC) neural activity is coordinated during SWRs for reactivation of spatial paths (Jadhav et al., 2016Jadhav S.P. Rothschild G. Roumis D.K. Frank L.M. Coordinated excitation and inhibition of prefrontal ensembles during awake hippocampal sharp-wave ripple events.Neuron. 2016; 90: 113-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, Peyrache et al., 2009Peyrache A.

Hippocampal-prefrontal reactivation during learning is stronger in awake compared with sleep states.J. Neurosci. 2017; 37: 11789-11805Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), but whether this coordinated CA1-PFC reactivation can distinguish hippocampal replay content in a behavioral context, and how it plays a role in memory-guided behavior, is not known. We therefore used continuous and simultaneous tracking of neural ensembles in CA1 and PFC throughout the course of learning of a replay-dependent W-track spatial alternation task to address three key questions: (1) how is awake CA1 replay involved in choice behavior during decision making; particularly, how do reverse and forward replay relate to past and future choices; (2) how replay content changes over learning and the evolution of reverse and forward replay as learning progresses; and (3) whether coordinated CA1-PFC replay can distinguish hippocampal replay content and its relationship to ongoing behavioral choices. We used continuous and simultaneous electrophysiological monitoring of ensembles of CA1 and PFC neurons in rats learning a novel W-track spatial alternation task within a single day (Figures 1 and S1). This task involves continuous alternation between reward wells on the three maze arms (Figure 1A). Animals are rewarded upon completion of a correct inbound or outbound sequence according to the following rules: (1) starting from either side well, animals have to return to the center well (inbound trajectories 2 and 4), and (2) starting from the center well, animals have to recall the previous inbound trajectory and choose the opposite side well from the previously visited one (outbound trajectories 1 and 3). Awake replay, as well as functional hippocampal-prefrontal interactions, is important for learning the outbound, spatial working memory component of this task (Fernández-Ruiz et al., 2019Fernández-Ruiz A. Oliva A. Fermino de Oliveira E. Rocha-Almeida F. Tingley D. Buzsáki G. Long-duration hippocampal sharp wave ripples improve memory.Science. 2019; 364: 1082-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, Jadhav et al., 2012Jadhav S.P. Kemere C. German P.W. Frank L.M. Awake hippocampal sharp-wave ripples support spatial memory.Science. 2012; 336: 1454-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, Maharjan et al., 2018Maharjan D.M. Dai Y.Y. Glantz E.H. Jadhav S.P. Disruption of dorsal hippocampal - prefrontal interactions using chemogenetic inactivation impairs spatial learning.Neurobiol. Learn. Mem. 2018; 155: 351-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The history-dependent, spatial working-memory behavioral sequence consists of two consecutive trajectories with a center-well transition (Figure 1Bi), where the past path is an inbound trajectory terminating at the center well, and the future path is an outbound trajectory proceeding to the opposite side-arm. In contrast, the inbound component requires implementation of a “return-to-center” rule based only on the current location from each side well (Figure 1Bii), and this reference memory rule is history independent. For side-well transitions, the past path is outbound, and the future path is inbound; the past and future paths are thus reversed at the center and side wells (Figure 1B). Animals (n = 6 rats) were tasked with learning the W-maze rules in eight behavioral sessions (epochs 1–8, or E1–8, 15–20 min per session) in a single experimental day, interleaved with rest sessions in a sleep box (single-day learning; learning curves in Figure S1; see STAR Methods) (Maharjan et al., 2018Maharjan D.M. Dai Y.Y. Glantz E.H. Jadhav S.P. Disruption of dorsal hippocampal - prefrontal interactions using chemogenetic inactivation impairs spatial learning.Neurobiol. Learn. Mem. 2018; 155: 351-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We continuously and simultaneously recorded from the same stable ensembles in dorsal CA1 (n = 216 cells with place fields on the track) and PFC (pre-limbic and anterior cingulate cortical regions; n = 154 cells) for all 8 sessions over the course of learning (5.5–6.5 h; see STAR Methods; recording locations in Figures S1A–S1C; isolation and stability parameters for simultaneously recorded neurons in six rats shown in Figures S1D–S1G). This experimental design thus enabled investigation of CA1-PFC replay dynamics using the same ensembles, starting from initial acquisition through later memory performance. CA1 place cells exhibited spatial and direction selectivity, with unique sequential representations of different trajectories (Figures 1C–1H). Figure 1C shows responses of all recorded CA1 place cells for the 4 trajectories in each behavioral session. Place cell encoding of spatial locations enabled accurate decoding of animal position during trajectory running (Figures 1D–1F) (Ambrose et al., 2016Ambrose R.E. Pfeiffer B.E. Foster D.J.

Comparison of opposing outbound-inbound trajectory pairs (Figure 1C shows linearized place-cell responses in pairs of trajectories with opposite running directions; 1 versus 2, and 3 versus 4) confirmed that place cells were directionally selective starting with the first session on the novel track (Foster and Wilson, 2006Foster D.J.

Despite the presence of bidirectional cells (37.7% ± 17.1%, mean ± SD; number of unidirectional cells in Table S1), place-field templates for all trajectories were distinguishable for all sessions (illustrated in the confusion matrices in Figures 1D–1F; cross-validated decoding error: 3.81 ± 0.13 cm in median ± SEM). Further, the stability and specificity of place-cell activity increased with familiarity (Frank et al., 2004Frank L.M. Stanley G.B. Brown E.N.

Thus, there was a change in average decoding error over sessions, but, notably, the highest decoding error (session 1: 6.30 ± 0.47 cm) was comparable to previous reports (Ambrose et al., 2016Ambrose R.E.

Therefore, CA1 ensembles exhibited independent population representations of the 4 behavioral trajectories starting from the first novel session, enabling accurate position decoding. We used these template place-cell sequence representations from stably recorded ensembles to detect and continuously track forward and reverse CA1 replay events throughout learning (Figures 2 and S2). To investigate replay content, we used established methods to detect SWRs and candidate events during immobility periods at reward wells and used Bayesian decoding to identify CA1 replay events, with each event distinctly determined as forward or reverse replay of one of the four trajectories (Ambrose et al., 2016Ambrose R.E.

Examples of forward- and reverse-replay sequences from the same CA1 ensembles in different learning stages of one animal are shown in Figures 2A–2F (additional examples in Figure S2). During immobility periods at reward-well transitions (immobility time: 10.3 ± 5.7 s in mean ± SD; Figure 2G), multiple SWRs and replay candidate events were detected (Figures 2H and 2I; immobility periods with ≥2 events, 85.7% or 1,313/1,533 trials for SWRs; 53.4% or 818/1,533 trials for replay candidate events). Further, there was no overall bias toward reverse or forward replay of any particular trajectory type (Figures 2J and 2K). In order to examine the relationship between replay content and behavioral choices, we focused on transition periods between trajectories. A correct behavioral sequence comprising two consecutive trajectories is illustrated for a side-well transition (Figures 3A–3C; similar example for a center-well transition in Figures S3A and S3B). This transition comprises an outbound past trajectory (RUN1, center-to-left), followed by an inbound future trajectory (RUN2, left-to-center), with the place-cell sequences ordered for RUN1 and RUN2 shown in the sorted CA1 activity (Figure 3A). Three replay events during this transition were identified as two reverse-replay events of the past (RUN1) and one forward-replay event of the future trajectory (RUN2) (Figures 3B and 3C) in an inter-mixed order of occurrence (reverse-forward-reverse). Replay events at the side well thus reactivated the past outbound trajectory in reverse and the future inbound trajectory in a forward order. A similar pattern of replay was seen at center-well transitions (Figures 3D, 3E, and S3), with preferential reverse replay of past inbound trajectories and forward replay of future outbound trajectories (examples show reverse replay of the alternative, not-taken past path in Figure 3D, and forward replay of the behaviorally actualized, taken future path in Figure 3E). Thus, for both center- and side-well transitions, reverse a"

Here we show that exposure to proinflammatory cytokines reveals a marked plasticity of the β-cell regulatory landscape. We expand the repertoire of human islet regulatory elements by mapping stimulus-responsive enhancers linked to changes in the β-cell transcriptome, proteome and three-dimensional chromatin structure. Our data indicate that the β-cell response to cytokines is mediated by the induction of new regulatory regions as well as the activation of primed regulatory elements prebound by islet-specific transcription factors. We find that T1D-associated loci are enriched with newly mapped cis-regulatory regions and identify T1D-associated variants disrupting cytokine-responsive enhancer activity in human β cells. Our study illustrates how β cells respond to a proinflammatory environment and implicate a role for stimulus response islet enhancers in T1D."

We recruited relatives of the identified carriers and showed that protection was associated with better insulin secretion due to enhanced glucose responsiveness and proinsulin conversion, particularly when compared with individuals matched for the genotype of a common T2D-risk allele in SLC30A8, p.Arg325. In genome-edited human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived β-like cells, we establish that the p.Arg138* allele results in reduced SLC30A8 expression due to haploinsufficiency. In human β cells, loss of SLC30A8 leads to increased glucose responsiveness and reduced KATP channel function similar to isolated islets from carriers of the T2D-protective allele p.Trp325. These data position ZnT8 as an appealing target for treatment aimed at maintaining insulin secretion capacity in T2D."
https://openalex.org/W2982620855,"Secretion principles are conserved from yeast to humans, and many yeast orthologs have established roles in synaptic vesicle exocytosis in the mammalian brain. Surprisingly, SEC4 orthologs and their effectors, the exocyst, are dispensable for synaptic vesicle exocytosis. Here, we identify the SEC4 ortholog RAB3 and its neuronal effector, RIM1, as essential molecules for neuropeptide and neurotrophin release from dense-core vesicles (DCVs) in mammalian neurons. Inactivation of all four RAB3 genes nearly ablated DCV exocytosis, and re-expression of RAB3A restored this deficit. In RIM1/2-deficient neurons, DCV exocytosis was undetectable. Full-length RIM1, but not mutants that lack RAB3 or MUNC13 binding, restored release. Strikingly, a short N-terminal RIM1 fragment only harboring RAB3- and MUNC13-interacting domains was sufficient to support DCV exocytosis. We propose that RIM and MUNC13 emerged as mammalian alternatives to the yeast exocyst complex as essential RAB3/SEC4 effectors and organizers of DCV fusion sites by recruiting DCVs via RAB3."
https://openalex.org/W2983624034,"Activation of platelets and neutrophils in septic shock results in the formation of microvascular clots containing an intricate scaffold of fibrin with neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) DNA. NETs contain multiple components that might impact endogenous fibrinolysis, resulting in failure to lyse clots in the microcirculation and residual systemic microthrombosis. We propose herein that the reservoir of human neutrophil elastase (HNE) on NETs may directly interfere with the fibrinolytic mechanism via a plasminogen proteolytic pathway. To investigate this mechanism, we constructed fibrin-NETs matrices by seeding and activating neutrophils onto a fibrin surface and monitored plasminogen activation or degradation. We demonstrate that the elastase activity of HNE-DNA complexes is protected from inhibition by plasma antiproteases and sustains its ability to degrade plasminogen. Using mass spectrometry proteomic analysis, we identified plasminogen fragments composed of kringle (K) domains (K1+2+3, k1+2+3+4) and the serine protease (SP) region (K5-SP). We further demonstrate that patients with septic shock with disseminated intravascular coagulation have circulating HNE-DNA complexes, HNE-derived plasminogen fragments, a low plasminogen concentration, and a reduced capacity to generate plasmin onto fibrin. In conclusion, we show that NETs bearing active HNE-DNA complexes reduce plasminogen into fragments, thus impairing fibrinolysis by decreasing the local plasminogen concentration, plasminogen binding to fibrin, and localized plasmin formation.-Barbosa da Cruz, D., Helms, J., Aquino, L.

The inflammasomes are cytosolic multiprotein complexes that recruit and activate Caspase-1, a key protease that triggers secretion of the inflammatory cytokine IL-1β (20Guo H. Callaway J.B. Ting J.P.

Recent publications provided new evidence that the NLR family caspase activation and recruitment domain–containing 4 (NLRC4) correlates with inflamm-aging (22Furman D. Chang J. Lartigue L. Bolen C.R.

Moreover, NLRC4-driven IL-1β production is critical for the progression of diabetic nephropathy (23Yuan F. Kolb R. Pandey G. Li W. Sun L. Liu F. Sutterwala F.S. Liu Y. Zhang W. Involvement of the NLRC4-inflammasome in diabetic nephropathy.PLoS One. 2016; 11 (27706238): e016413510.1371/journal.pone.0164135Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). NLRC4 is also reported to play a vital role in the progression of brain inflamm-aging (24Mejias N.H. Martinez C.C. Stephens M.E. de Rivero Vaccari J.P. Contribution of the inflammasome to inflammaging.J. Inflamm. (Lond.). 2018; 15 (30473634): 2310.1186/s12950-018-0198-3Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Hence, the activation of NLRC4 in diabetes may induce cell senescence and SASP in gingiva. In this study, a mouse model of hyperglycemia was used to investigate the local burden of senescent cells in gingiva and SASP in serum. Moreover, we utilized RAW264.7 macrophage cell lines to dissect the mechanistic role of NLRC4 in the progression of hyperglycemia-induced cell senescence and SASP in vitro. In addition, treatment with metformin in vivo and in vitro allowed preliminary insights into therapeutics for ameliorating the high local burden of senescent cells and SASP in gingiva. To eliminate the influence of age and focus on the effect of glucose only, 4-week-old mice were rendered hyperglycemic by successive injections of streptozotocin (STZ) (Fig. 1A). As shown in Fig. 1B, the blood glucose of the diabetic mice significantly increased between weeks 7 and 11 and stabilized at ∼30 mm between weeks 11 and 17. Western blotting analysis confirmed that p16 and p21 expression levels gradually increased in gingival tissue of diabetic mice from weeks 7 to 11 alongside the rise of blood glucose and elevated significantly from weeks 13 to 17 compared with the control mice (Fig. 1C). Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of gingival tissue revealed that the p16-positive and p21-positive cells gradually increased from weeks 9 to 17 and significantly increased from weeks 11 to 17 under ∼30 mm blood glucose in diabetic mice compared with the control (Fig. 1D). Then we determined whether hyperglycemia induced SASP in diabetic mice. We identified typical SASP factors in the serum of mice using a Luminex assay customization tool. As shown in Fig. 1E, expression of numerous cytokines changed to varying degrees. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α, IL-6, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-8, and advanced glycation end products (AGEs), gradually increased in the diabetic mice. However, anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-10 and adiponectin were significantly lower in diabetic than in control mice. Moreover, we investigated whether macrophages in the gingiva of diabetic mice were senescent. As shown in Fig. 1F, immunofluorescence staining revealed increased infiltration of macrophages (F4/80-positive cell) in gingival tissue of diabetic mice, and a significantly higher rate of p16-positive cells among these macrophages. In vivo data revealed higher infiltration of senescent macrophages in gingival tissue of diabetic mice. Next, we investigated whether high glucose induced cellular senescence and SASP in vitro using the macrophage cell line RAW 264.7.

The hallmarks of aging.Cell. 2013; 153 (23746838): 1194-121710.1016/j.cell.2013.05.039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7739) Google Scholar), gradually increased in macrophages exposed to 10–30 mm glucose for 24 h (Fig. 2A). Concomitantly, Western blotting also showed that p16 and p21 were gradually up-regulated with increasing glucose concentrations (Fig. 2B). The rate of SA–β-gal–positive (blue-stained) cells and the expression levels of p16 and p21 under 30 mm glucose for 24 h were significantly higher than under 5 mm glucose for 24 h and under 30 mm glucose for 6 h (#, p < 0.05; ##, p < 0.01; *, p < 0.05; and **, p < 0.01, respectively) (Fig. 2, A and B). In addition, Luminex analysis (Fig. 2C) revealed that within the SASP factors, pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines significantly increased and decreased, respectively, after high-glucose stimulation. The trends were consistent with the SASP of diabetic mice in vivo. We concluded that 30 mm glucose treatment for 24 h might be the optimal condition for high glucose–induced cellular senescence and SASP in macrophages. Then we determined whether the growth of senescent macrophages was arrested. Using 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine (EdU) as a cell-proliferation marker, macrophages exposed to 30 mm glucose for 24 h show significantly less EdU-positive cells than those exposed to 5 mm glucose for 24 h and 30 mm glucose for 6 h (##, p < 0.01; and **, p < 0.01, respectively; Fig. 2D). NLRC4 may be a key factor in the regulation of inflamm-aging (18Ebersole J.L. Kirakodu S. Novak M.J. Exposto C.R. Stromberg A.J. Shen S. Orraca L. Gonzalez-Martinez J. Gonzalez O.A.

Hence, we determined the activation of NLRC4 under hyperglycemia-induced cellular senescence microenvironment in vivo and in vitro by analysis of the target proteins. Western blotting results revealed that IRF8 and NLRC4 levels were higher in gingival tissue of diabetic than control mice between weeks 9 and 17 (Fig. 3A). IHC staining also showed significantly higher rates of IRF8- and NLRC4-positive cells in gingival tissue of diabetic compared with control mice in week 17 (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, phosphorylation of NLRC4 is critical for inflammasome activation (27Qu Y. Misaghi S. Izrael-Tomasevic A. Newton K. Gilmour L.L. Lamkanfi M. Louie S. Kayagaki N. Liu J. Kömüves L.

Western blotting results revealed that the phosphorylation of NLRC4 significantly increased in gingival tissue of diabetic mice compared with control mice between weeks 9 and 17 (Fig. 3A). In vitro, Western blotting showed that the levels of IRF8, p-NLRC4, and NLRC4 gradually increased in macrophages exposed to 10–30 mm for 24 h (Fig. 3C). Accordingly, IRF8, p-NLRC4, and NLRC4 levels under 30 mm glucose for 24 h were significantly higher than under 5 mm glucose for 24 h and under high glucose for 6 h (#, p < 0.05; ##, p < 0.01; *, p < 0.01; and **, p < 0.01, respectively). Immunofluorescence staining revealed that in macrophages exposed to 30 mm glucose for 24 h, IRF8 and NLRC4 increasingly accumulated in the cytoplasm and formed a ring-like structure (Fig. 3D). Simultaneously, NLRC4 could recruit and activate Caspase-1 (20Guo H. Callaway J.B. Ting J.P. Inflammasomes: mechanism of action, role in disease, and therapeutics.Nat. Med. 2015; 21 (26121197): 677-68710.1038/nm.3893Crossref PubMed Scopus (1918) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3E, diabetic mice have significantly higher levels of Caspase-1 p45 and p20 than control mice in week 17. In vitro, 30 mm glucose for 24 h could significantly increase the expression of Caspase-1 p45 and p20 compared with 5 mm glucose for 24 h and 30 mm glucose for 6 h (#, p < 0.05; ##, p < 0.01; *, p < 0.01; and **, p < 0.01, respectively) (Fig. 3F). As reported, SASP is mostly induced by NF-κB (29Salminen A. Kauppinen A. Kaarniranta K. Emerging role of NF-κB signaling in the induction of senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP).Cell Signal. 2012; 24 (22182507): 835-84510.1016/j.cellsig.2011.12.006Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 30Chien Y.

Consistently, Western blotting analysis revealed that high glucose could increase the expression of NF-κB in vivo (Fig. 3E) and in vitro (Fig. 3F). To pinpoint the contribution of NLRC4 to hyperglycemia-induced cell senescence and SASP, we knocked out NLRC4 in macrophages with the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Confirming previous results, the 24-h treatment with 30 mm glucose increased the rate of SA–β-gal–positive cells (Fig. 4A) and accumulated p16 and p21 in the cytoplasm of macrophages (Fig. 4B). However, the same treatment in NLRC4−/− macrophages distinctly down-regulated the activity of SA–β-gal (Fig. 4A) and decreased the cytoplasmic expression of p16 and p21 (Fig. 4B). Among the SASP factors, pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines significantly decreased and increased, respectively (Fig. 4C). Simultaneously, the expression of Caspase-1 p45, Caspase-1 p20, and NF-κB was down-regulated (Fig. 4D). Interestingly, knockout of NLRC4 decreased the expression level of IRF8 that is recognized as upstream of NLRC4 (26Karki R. Lee E. Place D. Samir P. Mavuluri J. Sharma B.R. Balakrishnan A. Malireddi R.K.S. Geiger R. Zhu Q. Neale G. Kanneganti T.D. IRF8 regulates transcription of Naips for NLRC4 inflammasome activation.Cell. 2018; 173 (29576451): 920-933.e1310.1016/j.cell.2018.02.055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4D). Furthermore, among IRF8−/− macrophages, cells showing positive SA–β-gal signal (Fig. 4A) and cytoplasmic expression of p16 and p21 (Fig. 4B) also significantly decreased. In addition, IRF8 knockout dephosphorylated NLRC4 and decreased the expression levels of NLRC4, Caspase-1 p45, Caspase-1 p20, and NF-κB (Fig. 4D). Meanwhile, the SASP factors showed similar changes as in NLRC4−/− macrophages exposed to 30 mm for 24 h (Fig. 4C). Thus, high glucose could not induce cellular senescence and SASP in IRF8−/− and NLRC4−/− macrophages. Metformin was recently revealed to reduce the risk and progression of inflamm-aging (31Xia S. Zhang X. Zheng S. Khanabdali R. Kalionis B. Wu J. Wan W. Tai X. An update on inflamm-aging: mechanisms, prevention, and treatment.J. Immunol. Res. 2016; 2016 (27493973): 8426874Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Here, we examined whether metformin could attenuate hyperglycemia-induced cellular senescence and SASP. In vivo, metformin had a remarkable hypoglycemic effect for diabetic mice (Fig. 5B). IHC revealed that p16- and p21-positive cells decreased in gingival tissue of diabetic mice treated with metformin (Fig. 5C). Accordingly, Western blotting analysis in these mice showed significant down-regulation of p16 and p21 in gingival tissue (Fig. 5F). Simultaneously, metformin could markedly ameliorate proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, TNFα, MMP-2, MMP-8, and AGEs and increase the levels of IL-10 and adiponectin (Fig. 5D). As shown in Fig. 5E, immunofluorescence staining indicated that metformin decreased the infiltration of senescent macrophages (F4/80/p16-positive cells) in gingival tissue of diabetic mice. Interestingly, metformin could also dephosphorylate and inhibit the expression of NLRC4 (Fig. 5F). Finally, metformin treatment also down-regulated IRF8, Caspase-1 p45, Caspase-1 p20, and NF-κB in gingival tissue (Fig. 5F). In vitro, co-treatment with 10 mm metformin and 30 mm glucose for 24 h in macrophages decreased SA–β-gal–positive cells (Fig. 6A) and reduced the expression and accumulation of p16 and p21 in the cytoplasm (Fig. 6B). Meanwhile, metformin altered the SASP factors by decreasing the pro-inflammatory and increasing the anti-inflammatory cytokines (Fig. 6C). Consistently with the in vivo results, metformin decreased the phosphorylation of NLRC4 and the expression levels of IRF8, NLRC4, Caspase-1 p45, Caspase-1 p20, and NF-κB in macrophages exposed to high glucose for 24 h (Fig. 6D). Finally, as shown in Fig. 6E, metformin also decreased the accumulation of IRF8 and NLRC4 in the cytoplasm. In this study, we investigated the biological mechanism by which hyperglycemia aggravated the inflamm-aging of macrophages in gingival tissue via NLRC4 phosphorylation and induced a high local burden of senescent cells and the secretion of SASP factors. The activation of NLRC4 stimulated the NF-κB/Caspase-1 cascade via IRF8-dependent signaling. Moreover, we found that metformin modulated hyperglycemia-induced cellular senescence and SASP through a NLRC4-dependent pathway. Therefore, we identified a NLRC4-mediated causal link between hyperglycemia and the inflamm-aging in gingival tissue and macrophages. Periodontitis is one of the major complications of diabetes mellitus, and hyperglycemia increases the susceptibility to and severity of this condition (32Choi Y.H. McKeown R.E. Mayer-Davis E.J. Liese A.D. Song K.B. Merchant A.T.

In the development of this disease, the gingiva is a critical component of innate immunity and provides protection as a mechanical barrier against microbial invasion (14Fujita T. Yoshimoto T.

Meanwhile, senescent cells secrete a number of extracellular factors leading to SASP that can reinforce senescence and amplify inflammation (13Prattichizzo F. De Nigris V. Mancuso E. Spiga R.

https://openalex.org/W2982613647,"Social environment modulates learning through unknown mechanisms. Here, we report that a pheromone mixture that signals overcrowding inhibits C. elegans from learning to avoid pathogenic bacteria. We find that learning depends on the balanced signaling of two insulin-like peptides (ILPs), INS-16 and INS-4, which act respectively in the pheromone-sensing neuron ADL and the bacteria-sensing neuron AWA. Pheromone exposure inhibits learning by disrupting this balance: it activates ADL and increases expression of ins-16, and this cellular effect reduces AWA activity and AWA-expressed ins-4. The activities of the sensory neurons are required for learning and the expression of the ILPs. Interestingly, pheromones also promote the ingestion of pathogenic bacteria while increasing resistance to the pathogen. Thus, the balance of the ILP signals integrates social information into the learning process as part of a coordinated adaptive response that allows consumption of harmful food during times of high population density."

Conventional chemotherapies are sometimes effective but accompanied by adverse events, warranting the identification of a biomarker of chemosensitivity. Objective Identify an mRNA biomarker that predicts chemosensitivity across solid tumor subtypes. Methods We performed a pan-solid tumor analysis integrating gene expression and drug sensitivity profiles from 3 cancer cell line datasets to identify transcripts correlated with sensitivity to a panel of chemotherapeutics. We then tested the ability of an mRNA biomarker to predictive clinical outcomes in cohorts of patients with breast, lung, or ovarian cancer. Results Expression levels of several mRNA transcripts were significantly correlated with sensitivity or resistance chemotherapeutics in cancer cell line datasets. The only mRNA transcript significantly correlated with sensitization to multiple classes of DNA-damaging chemotherapeutics in all 3 cell line datasets was encoded by Schlafen Family Member 11 (SLFN11). Analyses of multiple breast, lung, and ovarian cancer patient cohorts treated with chemotherapy confirmed SLFN11 mRNA expression as a predictive biomarker of longer overall survival and improved tumor response. Conclusions Tumor SLFN11 mRNA expression is a biomarker of sensitivity to an array of DNA-damaging chemotherapeutics across solid tumor subtypes."

Acot7, -9, and -13 localized to the matrix, joining Acot2 that was previously shown to localize there. Mitochondria from heart, skeletal muscle, brown adipose tissue, and kidney robustly expressed Acot2, -9, and -13; Acot9 levels were substantially higher in brown adipose tissue and kidney mitochondria, as was activity for C4:0-CoA, a unique Acot9 substrate. In all tissues, Acot2 accounted for about half of the thioesterase activity for C14:0-CoA and C16:0-CoA. In contrast, liver mitochondria from fed and fasted mice expressed little Acot activity, which was confined to long-chain CoAs and due mainly to Acot7 and Acot13 activities.

https://openalex.org/W2985004848,"Noncollagenous domain 1 (NCl)‐peptide is a biologically active peptide derived from the C‐terminal region of collagen α3(IV) chain, a structural constituent protein at the basement membrane in the rat testis, likely via proteolytic cleavage of matrix metalloproteinase 9. Studies have shown that this NC1 peptide regulates testis function by inducing Sertoli cell blood‐testis barrier (BTB) remodeling and is also capable of inducing elongate spermatid exfoliation through its disruptive effects on the organization of actin‐ and microtubule (MT)‐based cytoskeletons at these cell adhesion sites. However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains unknown. NC1 peptide was found to exert its biologic effects through an activation of small GTPase cell division control protein 42 homolog (Cdc42) because cooverexpression of the dominant negative mutant of Cdc42 [namely, Cdc42‐T17N ( via a single mutation of amino acid residue 17 from the N terminus from Thr to Asn by site‐directed mutagenesis, making it constitutively inactive)] and NC1 peptide was able to block the NC1 peptide‐induced Sertoli cell tight junction‐permeability barrier disruption. Their cooverexpression also blocked the NC1 peptide‐induced misdistribution of BTB‐associated proteins at the cell‐cell interface and also disruptive cytoskeletal organization of F‐actin and MTs through changes in spatial expression of the corresponding actin and MT regulatory proteins. Interestingly, NC1 peptide was also found to induce an up‐regulation of phosphorylated (p)‐ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6) (namely, p‐rpS6‐S235/S236) and a concomitant down‐regulation of p‐Akt1/2 (namely, p‐Akt1‐S473 and p‐Akt2‐S474), but these changes could not be blocked by overexpression of Cdc42‐T17N. More importantly, NC1 peptide‐induced Cdc42 activation was effectively blocked by treatment of Sertoli cell epithelium with a p‐Akt1/2 activator SC79, which is also capable of blocking NC1 peptide‐induced down‐regulation of p‐Akt1‐S473 and p‐Akt2/S474, but not p‐rpS6‐S235/S236 up‐regulation. In summary, these findings illustrate that Cdc42 is working downstream of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1/rpS6/Akt1/2 signaling pathway to support NC1 peptide‐mediated effects on Sertoli cell function in the testis using the rat as an animal model.—Su, W., Cheng, C.

Acute care surgery models are effective in decreasing mortality and morbidity after emergency surgeries, but sex-based differences in delivery and outcomes have not been explored. Our objective was to explore sex associated differences in the patient characteristics and clinical outcomes of those admitted to emergency general surgery.A post-hoc analysis of 512 emergency general surgical patients admitted consecutively to two tertiary care hospitals in Alberta Canada, between April 1, 2014 and July 31, 2015. We measured associations between sex and patient demographics, pre-, intra- and post-operative delivery of care, as well as post-operative outcomes.Of those excluded from the analysis, older females were more likely to undergo conservative management compared to older men (41% vs 34%, p = 0.03). Overall, there were no differences between sexes for time from admission to surgery, time spent in surgery, overall complication rate, mortality, hospital length of stay, or discharge disposition. Women were more likely to have a cancer diagnosis [OR 4.12 (95% CI: 1.61-10.5), p = 0.003, adjusted for age], while men were more likely to receive hernia surgery [OR 2.33 (95% CI 1.35-4.02), p = 0.002, adjusted for age and Charlson Comorbidity Index]. Finally, men were more likely to have a major respiratory complication [OR 2.73 (95% CI: 1.19-6.24), p = 0.02, adjusted for age].Only two differences in peri and post-operative complications between sexes were noted, which suggests sex-based disparity in quality of care is limited once a decision has been made to operate. Future studies with larger databases are needed to corroborate our findings and investigate potential sex biases in surgical versus conservative management."

Existing evidence on the sociocultural context remains unconsolidated. In this qualitative research synthesis, we aggregate research literature on contextual factors that potentially predispose adult women and adolescent girls to overweight and obesity to inform research, policies and programs over the life course.PubMed, CINAHL, PsychInfo, ProQuest Central, EMBASE, and Web of Science were searched to locate qualitative research articles conducted in SSA countries beginning in the year 2000. After assessment for eligibility and critical appraisal, 17 studies were included in the synthesis. Textual data and quotes were synthesized using meta-aggregation methods proposed by the Joanna Briggs Institute.The synthesized studies were conducted in South Africa, Ghana, Kenya and Botswana. The three overarching themes across these studies were body size and shape ideals, barriers to healthy eating, and barriers to physical activity, with cultural and social factors as cross-cutting influences within the major themes. Culturally, the supposedly ideal African woman was expected to be overweight or obese, and voluptuous, and this was associated with their identity. Although being overweight or obese was not acceptable to adolescent girls, they desired to be voluptuous. Healthy food choices among women and adolescent girls were hampered by several factors including affordability of nutritious foods and peer victimization. Both adult women and adolescent girls experienced ageism as a barrier to physical activity.This is the first qualitative research synthesis to amplify the voices of women and girls in SSA countries highlighting the challenges they face in maintaining a healthy body weight. Sociocultural, institutional and peer-related factors were powerful forces shaping body size preferences, food choices and participation in physical activity. Our study findings provide insights for the design of contextually appropriate obesity prevention interventions and lay the foundation for further research studies."

https://openalex.org/W2988786639,"Introduction Voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) provides significant reductions in the risk of female-to-male HIV transmission. Since 2007, VMMC has been a key component of the United States President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief’s (PEPFAR) strategy to mitigate the HIV epidemic in countries with high HIV prevalence and low circumcision rates. To ensure intended effects, PEPFAR sets ambitious annual circumcision targets and provides funding to implementation partners to deliver local VMMC services. In Kenya to date, 1.9 million males have been circumcised; in 2017, 60% of circumcisions were among 10-14-year-olds. We conducted a qualitative field study to learn more about VMMC program implementation in Kenya. Methods and results The study setting was a region in Kenya with high HIV prevalence and low male circumcision rates. From March 2017 through April 2018, we carried out in-depth interviews with 29 VMMC stakeholders, including “mobilizers”, HIV counselors, clinical providers, schoolteachers, and policy professionals. Additionally, we undertook observation sessions at 14 VMMC clinics while services were provided and observed mobilization activities at 13 community venues including, two schools, four public marketplaces, two fishing villages, and five inland villages. Analysis of interview transcripts and observation field notes revealed multiple unintended consequences linked to the pursuit of targets. Ebbs and flows in the availability of school-age youths together with the drive to meet targets may result in increased burdens on clinics, long waits for care, potentially misleading mobilization practices, and deviations from the standard of care. Conclusion Our findings indicate shortcomings in the quality of procedures in VMMC programs in a low-resource setting, and more importantly, that the pursuit of ambitious public health targets may lead to compromised service delivery and protocol adherence. There is a need to develop improved or alternative systems to balance the goal of increasing service uptake with the responsible conduct of VMMC."
https://openalex.org/W2982936998,"One of the most abundant phenolic compounds traced in olive tissues is hydroxytyrosol (HT), a molecule that has been attributed with a pile of beneficial effects, well documented by many epidemiological studies and thus adding value to products containing it. Strong antioxidant capacity and protection from cancer are only some of its exceptional features making it ideal as a potential supplement or preservative to be employed in the nutraceutical, agrochemical, cosmeceutical, and food industry. The HT biosynthetic pathway in plants (e.g. olive fruit tissues) is not well apprehended yet. In this contribution we employed a metabolic engineering strategy by constructing a dual pathway introduced in Escherichia coli and proofing its significant functionality leading it to produce HT. Our primary target was to investigate whether such a metabolic engineering approach could benefit the metabolic flow of tyrosine introduced to the conceived dual pathway, leading to the maximalization of the HT productivity. Various gene combinations derived from plants or bacteria were used to form a newly inspired, artificial biosynthetic dual pathway managing to redirect the carbon flow towards the production of HT directly from glucose. Various biosynthetic bottlenecks faced due to feaB gene function, resolved through the overexpression of a functional aldehyde reductase. Currently, we have achieved equimolar concentration of HT to tyrosine as precursor when overproduced straight from glucose, reaching the level of 1.76 mM (270.8 mg/L) analyzed by LC-HRMS. This work realizes the existing bottlenecks of the metabolic engineering process that was dependent on the utilized host strain, growth medium as well as to other factors studied in this work."

However, it remains unclear whether the SSR involves a common set of core proteins regardless of the type of stress or whether each particular type of stress induces a stress-specific SSR that targets a unique, largely nonoverlapping set of Sumo substrates. In this study, we used MS and a Gene Ontology approach to identify differentially sumoylated proteins during heat stress, hyperosmotic stress, oxidative stress, nitrogen starvation, and DNA alkylation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells. Our results indicate that each stress triggers a specific SSR signature centered on proteins involved in transcription, translation, and chromatin regulation. Strikingly, whereas the various stress-specific SSRs were largely nonoverlapping, all types of stress tested here resulted in desumoylation of subunits of RNA polymerase III, which correlated with a decrease in tRNA synthesis. We conclude that desumoylation and subsequent inhibition of RNA polymerase III constitutes the core of all stress-specific SSRs in yeast.

https://openalex.org/W2987794974,"Quantitative PCR (qPCR) allows the precise measurement of DNA concentrations and is generally considered to be straightforward and trouble free. However, analyses using validated Sybr Green I-based assays regularly amplify both the correct product and an artifact. Amplification of more than 1 product can be recognized when melting curve analysis is performed after the qPCR. Currently, such reactions need to be excluded from further analysis because the quantification result is considered meaningless. However, when the fraction of the fluorescence associated with the correct product can be determined, the quantitative result of the qPCR analysis can be corrected. The main assumptions of this correction model are: 1) the melting peak of the correct product can be identified, 2) the PCR efficiencies of all amplified products are similar, 3) the relative size of the melting peaks reflects the relative concentrations of the products, and 4) the relative concentrations do not change as the reaction reaches plateau. These assumptions were validated in a series of model experiments. The results show that the quantitative results can be corrected. Implementation of a correction for the presence of artifact amplification in the analysis of qPCR data leads to more reliable quantitative results in qPCR experiments.-Ruijter, J.

https://openalex.org/W2988543686,"The expression of thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), a cytokine which greatly contributes to the induction of type I allergy, is upregulated in chronic inflammation such as atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. As hypoxia in the epidermis is important for maintaining skin homeostasis, we examined the regulation of TSLP expression by hypoxic conditions in normal skin epithelial tissues. TNF-α-induced expression of TSLP in human keratinocyte HaCaT and in mouse keratinocyte PAM212 cell lines were inhibited under hypoxic condition (1% O2), although the mRNA expressions of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, and VEGF-A were not inhibited. Hypoxia-mimicking conditions, which include NiCl2, CoCl2, and DMOG, an inhibitor of 2-oxoglutarate-dependent enzymes, also selectively inhibited TNF-α-induced TSLP expression. These results suggested that inactivation of prolyl hydroxylase by hypoxia and hypoxia-mimicking conditions is involved in the repression of TNF-α-induced TSLP expression. Interestingly, the inhibition of TSLP production by hypoxic treatment was significantly reversed by treatment with the HIF-2α antagonist but not with the HIF-1α inhibitor. DMOG-induced inhibition of TSLP promoter activity was dependent on the -71 to +185 bp promoter region, suggesting that the binding of HIF-2 to hypoxia response element (HRE) in this region repressed the TSLP expression. These results indicated that hypoxia and hypoxia-mimicking conditions inhibited TSLP expression via HIF-2 and HRE-dependent mechanisms. Therefore, PHD and HIF-2α could be a new strategy for treatment of atopic dermatitis and psoriasis."
https://openalex.org/W2983314105,"Fast detection of low-abundance protein remains a challenge because detection speed is limited by analyte transport to the detection site of a biosensor. In this paper, we demonstrate a scalable fabrication process for producing vertical nanogaps between micropillars which enable ion concentration polarization (ICP) enrichment for fast analyte detection. Compared to horizontal nanochannels, massively paralleled vertical nanogaps not only provide comparable electrokinetics, but also significantly reduce fluid resistance, enabling microbead-based assays. The channels on the device are straightforward to fabricate and scalable using conventional lithography tools. The device is capable of enriching protein molecules by >1000 fold in 10 min. We demonstrate fast detection of IL6 down to 7.4 pg/ml with only a 10 min enrichment period followed by a 5 min incubation. This is a 162-fold enhancement in sensitivity compared to that without enrichment. Our results demonstrate the possibility of using silicon/silica based vertical nanogaps to mimic the function of polymer membranes for the purpose of protein enrichment."
https://openalex.org/W2983625246,"Cleft lip (CL), cleft palate (CP) and cleft lip and palate (CLP) are the most common types of orofacial clefts in dogs. Orofacial clefts in dogs are clinically relevant because of the associated morbidity and high newborn mortality rate and are of interest as comparative models of disease. However, the incidence of CL, CP and CLP has not been investigated in purebred dogs, and the financial impact on breeders is unknown. The aims of this study were to document the incidence patterns of CL, CP and CLP in different breeds of dogs, determine whether defect phenotype is associated with skull type, genetic cluster and geographic location, and estimate the financial impact in breeding programs in the United States by means of an anonymous online survey. A total of 228 orofacial clefts were reported among 7,429 puppies whelped in the 12 preceding months. Breeds in the mastiff/terrier genetic cluster and brachycephalic breeds were predisposed to orofacial clefts. Certain breeds in the ancient genetic cluster were at increased odds of orofacial clefts. Male purebred dogs were at increased odds of CPs. Results confirm that brachycephalic breeds are overrepresented among cases of orofacial clefts. Furthermore, geographic region appeared to be a relevant risk factor and orofacial clefts represented a considerable financial loss to breeders. Improved understanding of the epidemiology of orofacial clefts (frequency, causes, predictors and risk factors) may help in identifying ways to minimize their occurrence. Information gained may potentially help veterinarians and researchers to diagnose, treat and prevent orofacial clefts."
https://openalex.org/W2984411272,"The study underpins barcode characterization of insect species collected from Saudi Arabia and explored functional constraints during evolution at the DNA and protein levels to expect the possible mechanisms of protein evolution in insects. Codon structure designated AT-biased insect barcode of the cytochrome C oxidase I (COI). In addition, the predicted 3D structure of COI protein indicated tyrosine in close proximity with the heme ligand, depicted substitution to phenylalanine in two Hymenopteran species. This change resulted in the loss of chemical bonding with the heme ligand. The estimated nucleotide substitution matrices in insect COI barcode generally showed a higher probability of transversion compared with the transition. Computations of codon-by-codon nonsynonymous substitutions in Hymenopteran and Hemipteran species indicated that almost half of the codons are under positive evolution. Nevertheless, codons of COI barcode of Coleoptera, Lepidoptera and Diptera are mostly under purifying selection. The results reinforce that codons in helices 2, 5 and 6 and those in loops 2-3 and 5-6 are mostly conserved and approach strong purifying selection. The overall results argue the possible evolutionary position of Hymenopteran species among those of other insects."
https://openalex.org/W2986624691,"Overconsumption of highly sugary foods contributes to increases in obesity and diabetes in our population, and initiatives are issued worldwide to reduce sugar content in food products. However, it is unclear how the presentation of reduced sugar content on food packages affects taste expectations of consumers. Based on the learned knowledge about negative health effects of sugar and the common belief that unhealthy food tastes better than healthy food, consumers might conclude that lower sugar levels are associated with higher healthiness and lower tastiness. Addressing this concern, we examined how quantitative information about sugar content without any verbal description influences consumers' health and taste expectations of dairy desserts. We asked participants to indicate the expected healthiness and tastiness of randomly sampled dairy desserts, while varying systematically the quantitative sugar information provided in a label presented with the desserts (numerical sugar level in grams per 100 grams of product: low vs. original vs. high). We assumed that quantitative sugar content is not equally associated with healthiness and tastiness of products and that numerical information about sugar content informs health more than taste expectations. Therefore, we predicted that consumers expect higher healthiness, but not to the same degree lower tastiness for products with reduced sugar contented compared to products with higher sugar content. The results of the present study are in line with this hypothesis. We found that consumers expected desserts with less sugar to be healthier than desserts with higher levels of sugar. The experimentally varied sugar levels did not affect the tastiness expectations. Notably, consumers did not follow the unhealthy = tasty intuition and did not devaluate the tastiness of desserts because of heightened healthiness expectations. Our findings suggest that sole numerical information about sugar content-an important nutritional value-is more diagnostic in the construction of healthiness rather than tastiness expectations of food products."
https://openalex.org/W2987528796,"Objective To investigate whether gaze stabilization exercises (GSEs) improve eye and head movements and whether low-frequency cerebellar repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) inhibits GSE trainability. Methods 25 healthy adults (real rTMS, n = 12; sham rTMS, n = 13) were recruited. Real or sham rTMS was performed for 15 min (1 Hz, 900 stimulations). The center of the butterfly coil was set 1 cm below the inion in the real rTMS. Following stimulation, 10 trials of 1 min of a GSE were conducted at 1 min intervals. In the GSE, the subjects were instructed to stand upright and horizontally rotate their heads according to a beeping sound corresponding to 2 Hz and with a gaze point ahead of them. Electrooculograms were used to estimate the horizontal gaze direction of the right eye, and gyroscopic measurements were performed to estimate the horizontal head angular velocity during the GSE trials. The percentage change from the first trial of motion range of the eye and head was calculated for each measurement. The percent change of the eye/head range ratio was calculated to assess the synchronous changes of the eye and head movements as the exercise increased. Results Bayesian two-way analysis of variance showed that cerebellar rTMS affected the eye motion range and eye/head range ratio. A post hoc comparison (Bayesian t-test) showed evidence that the eye motion range and eye/head range ratio were reduced in the fifth, sixth, and seventh trials compared with the first trial sham stimulation condition. Conclusions GSEs can modulate eye movements with respect to head movements, and the cerebellum may be associated with eye–head coordination trainability for dynamic gazing during head movements."

Faecal samples were collected from a total of 306 post-weaned calves (3–12 months old) from 10 farms, including 4 intensive feeding farms and 6 free-ranging farms. The overall infection rate of G. duodenalis was 41.2% (126/306) based on the PCR results at any of the three genetic loci: beta-giardin (bg), triose-phosphate isomerase (tpi) and glutamate dehydrogenase (gdh) genes. Giardia duodenalis assemblages E (n = 115, 91.3%), A (n = 3, 2.4%), and A mixed with E (n = 8, 6.3%) were identified among the 126 positive specimens. Multilocus sequence typing of G. duodenalis revealed 34 assemblage E multilocus genotypes (MLGs), 1 assemblage A MLG and 7 mixed assemblage (A and E) MLGs.

A total of 125 participants were randomly assigned to sit in an unadorned room for six minutes and either (a) use their mobile phone, (b) sit alone with no phone, or (c) sit with their device but resist using it. Consistent with prior work, participants self-reported more concentration difficulty and more mind wandering with no device present compared to using the phone. Resisting the phone led to greater perceived concentration abilities than sitting without the device (not having external stimulation). Failing to replicate prior work, however, participants without external stimulation did not rate the experience as less enjoyable or more boring than having something to do. We also observed that skin conductance data were consistent across conditions for the first three-minutes of the experiment, after which participants who resisted the phone were less aroused than those who were without the phone. We discuss how the findings contribute to our understanding of exercising self-control with mobile media and how psychological consequences, such as increased mind wandering and focusing challenges, relate to periods of idleness or free thinking."
https://openalex.org/W2982781110,"Catecholamine excess reflecting an adrenergic overdrive of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) has been proposed to link to hyperleptinemia in obesity and may contribute to the development of metabolic disorders. However, relationship between the catecholamine level and plasma leptin in obesity has not yet been investigated. Moreover, whether pharmacological blockade of the adrenergic overdrive in obesity by the third-generation beta-blocker agents such as carvedilol could help to prevent metabolic disorders is controversial and remains to be determined. Using the high fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mouse model, we found that basal plasma norepinephrine, the principal catecholamine as an index of SNS activity, was persistently elevated and highly correlated with plasma leptin concentration during obesity development. Targeting the adrenergic overdrive from this chronic norepinephrine excess in HFD-induced obesity with carvedilol, a third-generation beta-blocker with vasodilating action, blunted the HFD-induced hepatic glucose over-production by suppressing the induction of gluconeogenic enzymes, and enhanced the muscular insulin signaling pathway. Furthermore, carvedilol treatment in HFD-induced obese mice decreased the enlargement of white adipose tissue and improved the glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity without affecting body weight and blood glucose levels. Our results suggested that catecholamine excess in obesity might directly link to the hyperleptinemic condition and the therapeutic targeting of chronic adrenergic overdrive in obesity with carvedilol might be helpful to attenuate obesity-related metabolic disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2983244315,"In murine fetal germ cells, retinoic acid (RA) is an extrinsic cue for meiotic initiation that stimulates transcriptional activation of the Stimulated by retinoic acid gene 8 (Stra8), which is required for entry of germ cells into meiotic prophase I. Canonically, the biological activities of RA are mediated by nuclear RA receptors. Recent studies in somatic cells found that RA noncanonically stimulates intracellular signal transduction pathways to regulate multiple cellular processes. In this study, using a germ cell culture system, we investigated (1) whether RA treatment activates any mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways in fetal germ cells at the time of sex differentiation, and (2) if this is the case, whether the corresponding RA-stimulated signaling pathway regulates Stra8 expression in fetal germ cells and their entry into meiosis. When XX germ cells at embryonic day (E) 12.5 were cultured with RA, the extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 pathway was predominantly activated. MEK1/2 inhibitor (U0126) treatment suppressed the mRNA expressions of RA-induced Stra8 and meiotic marker genes (Rec8, Spo11, Dmc1, and Sycp3) in both XX and XY fetal germ cells. Furthermore, U0126 treatment dramatically reduced STRA8 protein levels and numbers of meiotic cells among cultured XX and XY fetal germ cells even in the presence of RA. Taken together, our results suggest the novel concept that the RA functions by stimulating the ERK1/2 pathway and that this activity is critical for Stra8 expression and meiotic progression in fetal germ cells."
https://openalex.org/W2985673344,"Background and aims A relationship exists between an adolescent’s level of motor competence and the health of their identity. As those with low motor competence (LMC) form less healthy identities, the aim of this study was to investigate if self-perceptions mediated the negative impact of LMC on identity health. Methods Adolescents (N = 160) completed the Adolescent Motor Competence Questionnaire (AMCQ), Assessment of Identity Development in Adolescence (AIDA) and the Self Perception Profile for Adolescence (SPPA). The mediating effect of their self-perceptions on the relationship between motor competence and identity health was examined in several ways: for the total sample, between male and females, and level of motor competence. Two motor competence groups were formed by dichotomizing their AMCQ scores (< 83 = LMC). Results There was an indirect effect of self-perceptions of social competence, physical appearance, romantic appeal, behavioural conduct, close friendships and global self-worth on the relationship between motor competence and identity health for the total sample (N = 160, 64.4% males, Mage = 14.45 SD = .75, 12 to 16 years). No indirect effects were significant for females however close friendships and global self-worth were significant for the males. When the sample was grouped for motor competence, indirect effects of social competence, athletic competence, physical appearance, behavioural conduct, and global self-worth were significant for the high motor competence (HMC) group. The only self-perception significant for the LMC group was close friendships. Conclusion Self-perceptions in several domains mediated the relationship between motor competence and identity health, and these differed for level of motor competence but not gender. Those with LMC who had a higher self-perception in the close friendships domain had a healthier identity. Designing physical activity programs that focus on skill development and forming close friendships are important for adolescents with LMC."
https://openalex.org/W2987789766,"The development of an effective subunit vaccine is frequently complicated by the difficulty of eliciting protective immune responses, often requiring the co-administration of an adjuvant. Heat-labile toxin (LT), an enterotoxin expressed by enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) with an AB5 structure similar to cholera toxin, is a strong adjuvant. While the mucosa represents the natural route of exposure to LT and related toxins, the clinical utility of LT and similar adjuvants given by mucosal routes has been limited by toxicity, as well as the association between intranasal delivery of LT and Bell's palsy. Single and double amino acid mutants of LT, LT(R192G)/mLT and LT(R192G/L211A)/dmLT respectively, have been proposed as alternatives to reduce the toxicity associated with the holotoxin. In the present study, we compared mLT and dmLT given via a non-mucosal route (i.e. intradermally) to investigate their adjuvanticity when co-administrated with an enterotoxigenic E. coli vaccine candidate, CfaEB. Antigenicity (i.e. ability to elicit response against LT) and reactogenicity at the injection site were also evaluated. BALB/c mice were immunized by the intradermal route with CfaEB plus increasing doses of either mLT or dmLT (0.01 to 2.5 μg). Both adjuvants induced dose-dependent skin reactogenicity, with dmLT being less reactogenic than mLT. Both adjuvants significantly boosted the anti-CfaE IgG and functional hemagglutination inhibiting (HAI) antibody responses, compared to the antigen alone. In addition to inducing anti-LT responses, even at the lowest dose tested (0.01 μg), the adjuvants also prompted in vitro cytokine responses (IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10 and IL-17) that followed different patterns, depending on the protein used for stimulation (CfaE or LTB) and/or the dose used for immunization. The two LT mutants evaluated here, mLT and dmLT, are potent adjuvants for intradermal immunization and should be further investigated for the intradermal delivery of subunit ETEC vaccines."

Here, we sought to investigate the effect of subnuclear localization on the transcriptional activation of eight murine microRNA loci in the immune system. Our results show that microRNA genes display a preferential monoallelic gene expression profile accompanied with perinuclear localization irrespectively of their transcription status or differentiation state. The expression profile and perinuclear localization are developmentally conserved while microRNA gene loci localization outside constitutive lamin associated domains is cross-species conserved. Our findings provide support for an active nuclear periphery and its role in chromatin organization of the non-coding genome."
https://openalex.org/W2985749924,"Background Persistent infections with high-risk genital Human papillomavirus (HPV) especially types 16 and 18, are associated with cervical cancer. However, distribution of HPV types varies greatly across geographical regions and the available vaccines target only few types. This study was designed to determine the HPV types circulating in Southwestern Nigeria, thereby providing necessary information for effective control of the virus. Methods Endocervical swab samples were collected from a total of 295 consenting women attending routine cervical cancer screening, STI clinics and community-based outreach programme. Viral DNA was extracted from the samples and the consensus region of the HPV DNA was amplified by PCR using GP-E6/E7 primers. Type-specific nested multiplex PCR and Sanger sequencing were used to genotype the HPV isolates. Results In this study, 51 (17.3%) individuals were positive for HPV DNA using consensus primers that target the E6/E7 genes but only 48 (16.3%) were genotyped. A total of 15 HPV types (HPV-6, 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 42, 43, 44, 52, 58, 66, 74, 81, 86) were detected, with HPV-31 being the most predominant (32.8%), followed by HPV-35 (17.2%) and HPV-16 (15.5%). Two rare HPV types; 74 and 86 were also detected. The HPV-74 isolate had three nucleotide (CCT) insertions at E7 gene that translated into amino acid proline. Highest nucleotide substitutions (n = 32) were found in HPV-44 genotype. Among positive individuals, 20.8% had dual infections and 86.2% had High-risk HPV types. Conclusions Multiple Human papillomavirus types co-circulated in the study. Most of the circulating Human papillomavirus are high-risk type with type 31 being the most predominant. Although the implication of HPV-74 with proline insertion detected for the first time is unknown, it may have effect on the transformation potential of the virus. Polyvalent HPV vaccine will be more effective for the infection control in Nigeria."

However, the structural basis for the regulation of their catalytic activity is not fully understood, and RPTPs are generally not therapeutically targetable.

Contrary to what is known from structure–function studies of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), RPTP activities have been reported to be suppressed by dimerization, which may prevent RPTPs from accessing their RTK substrates. We report here that homodimerization of protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor J (PTPRJ, also known as DEP-1) is regulated by specific transmembrane (TM) residues. We found that disrupting these interactions destabilizes homodimerization of full-length PTPRJ in cells, reduces the phosphorylation of the known PTPRJ substrate epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and of other downstream signaling effectors, antagonizes EGFR-driven cell phenotypes, and promotes substrate access. We demonstrate these observations in human cancer cells using mutational studies and identified a peptide that binds to the PTPRJ TM domain and represents the first example of an allosteric agonist of RPTPs. The results of our study provide fundamental structural and functional insights into how PTPRJ activity is tuned by TM interactions in cells.

https://openalex.org/W2987670897,"In favorable conditions, Daphnia magna undergoes parthenogenesis to increase progeny production in a short time. However, in unfavorable conditions, Daphnia undergoes sexual reproduction instead and produces resting eggs. Here, we report live observations of the oviposition process in Daphnia magna. We observed that the cellular contents flowed irregularly through the narrow egg canal during oviposition. Amorphous ovarian eggs developed an oval shape immediately after oviposition and, eventually, a round shape. Oviposition of resting eggs occurred in a similar way. Based on the observations, we propose that, unlike Drosophila eggs, Daphnia eggs cannot maintain cytoplasmic integrity during oviposition. We also determined that the parthenogenetic eggs were activated within 20 min, as demonstrated by vitelline envelope formation. Therefore, it is plausible that the eggs of Daphnia magna may be activated by squeezing pressure during oviposition."

We evaluated three kidney measurements during the bench surgery; the final graft volume was calculated using the ellipsoid formula and adjusted to body surface area.In the living donors there was positive correlation between adjusted graft volume and eGFR (r = 0.311, p = 0.008). Multivariate analysis revealed that low rejection rate and increased adjusted graft volume were independent factors correlated with eGFR. In deceased donors, there was no correlation between adjusted kidney volume and eGFR (r = 0.08, p = 0.279) in univariate analysis, but a multivariate analysis indicated that lower kidney donor profile index (KDPI), absence of rejection and high adjusted kidney volume were independent factors for better eGFR.Adjusted kidney volume was positively correlated with a satisfactory eGFR at one year after living donor and deceased donor transplantations."
https://openalex.org/W2982777282,"The D2 dopamine receptor and the serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A receptor (5-HT2A) are closely-related G-protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) from the class A bioamine subfamily. Despite structural similarity, they respond to distinct ligands through distinct downstream pathways, whose dysregulation is linked to depression, bipolar disorder, addiction, and psychosis. They are important drug targets, and it is important to understand how their bias toward G-protein versus β-arrestin signaling pathways is regulated. Previously, evolution-based computational approaches, difference Evolutionary Trace and Evolutionary Trace–Mutual information (ET-Mip), revealed residues and residue pairs that, when switched in the D2 receptor to the corresponding residues from 5-HT2A, altered ligand potency and G-protein activation efficiency. We have tested these residue swaps for their ability to trigger recruitment of β-arrestin2 in response to dopamine or serotonin. The results reveal that the selected residues modulate agonist potency, maximal efficacy, and constitutive activity of β-arrestin2 recruitment. Whereas dopamine potency for most variants was similar to that for WT and lower than for G-protein activation, potency in β-arrestin2 recruitment for N124H3.42 was more than 5-fold higher. T205M5.54 displayed high constitutive activity, enhanced dopamine potency, and enhanced efficacy in β-arrestin2 recruitment relative to WT, and L379F6.41 was virtually inactive. These striking differences from WT activity were largely reversed by a compensating mutation (T205M5.54/L379F6.41) at residues previously identified by ET-Mip as functionally coupled. The observation that the signs and relative magnitudes of the effects of mutations in several cases are at odds with their effects on G-protein activation suggests that they also modulate signaling bias.

https://openalex.org/W2984667955,"To estimate the cost-effectiveness of available diagnosis alternatives for Mucosal Leishmaniasis (ML) in Colombian suspected patients. A simulation model of the disease's natural history was built with a decision tree and Markov models. The model´s parameters were identified by systematic review and validated by expert consensus. A bottom-up cost analysis to estimate the costs of diagnostic strategies and treatment per case was performed by reviewing 48 clinical records of patients diagnosed with ML. The diagnostic strategies compared were as follows: 1) no diagnosis; 2) parasite culture, biopsy, indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA), and Montenegro skin test (MST) combined ; 3) parasite culture, biopsy, and IFA combined; 4) PCR-miniexon; and 5) PCR-kDNA. Three scenarios were modeled in patients with ML clinical suspicion, according to ML prevalence scenarios: high, medium and low. Adjusted sensitivity and specificity parameters of a combination of diagnostic tests were estimated with a discrete event simulation (DES) model. For each alternative, the costs and health outcomes were estimated. The time horizon was life expectancy, considering the average age at diagnosis of 31 years. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated per Disability Life Year (DALY) avoided, and deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. A threshold of willingness to pay (WTP) of three-time gross domestic product per capita (GDPpc) (US$ 15,795) and a discount rate of 3% was considered. The analysis perspective was the third payer (Health System). All costs were reported in American dollars as of 2015. PCR- kDNA was the cost-effective alternative in clinical suspicion levels: low, medium and high with ICERs of US$ 7,909.39, US$ 5,559.33 and US$ 4,458.92 per DALY avoided, respectively. ML diagnostic tests based on PCR are cost-effective strategies, regardless of the level of clinical suspicion. PCR-kDNA was the most cost-effective strategy in the competitive scenario with the parameters included in the present model."
https://openalex.org/W2986386981,"Background Cognitive impairment (CI) in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a frequent neuropsychiatric manifestation affecting several domains, even in apparently asymptomatic patients. Current research revealed that the typical CI pattern affects frontal-subcortical circuit and thus executive functions. The impairment of non-literal language or pragmatic language (PL), including metaphors, idioms, inferences or irony has been well described in several conditions such as autism disorders, Parkinson’s disease, brain injury and even in earlier phases of neurodegenerative processes. Even if PL neuro-anatomy remains controversial, correlation between executive dysfunctions and non-literal language involvement has been reported both in traumatic injury and mild cognitive impairment patients. Nonetheless, no specific study has been performed to evaluate PL impairment in SLE patients so far. Objectives We aimed at assessing the PL domain in a Italian monocentric SLE cohort in comparison to healthy controls, matched to age and education, through a specific battery, the batteria sul linguaggio dell'emisfero destro (BLED). Secondly, we focused attention on possible correlations between CI and clinical and laboratory SLE-related features. Methods Forty adult patients affected by SLE, according to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria, and thirty healthy subjects were enrolled consecutively in this cross-sectional study. The protocol included complete physical examination, extensive clinical and laboratory data collection (comprehensive of demographics, past medical history, co-morbidities, disease activity, chronic damage evaluation, previous and concomitant treatments) and cognitive assessment for five different domains: memory, attention, pragmatic language, executive and visuospatial functions. Self-reported scale for anxiety and depression were performed to exclude the influence of mood disorders on cognitive dysfunction. Results We studied 40 Caucasian SLE patients [male (M)/ female (F) 3/37; mean±standard deviation (SD) age 45.9±10.1 years, mean±SD disease duration 120.8±81.2 months] and 30 healthy subjects (M/F 9/21; mean±SD age 41.3±13 years). According to the low level of disease activity and damage (mean±SD Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K) of 1.3±2.3, mean±SD Systemic Lupus International Collaborative Clinics/American College of Rheumatology (SLICC/ACR) Damage Index (SDI) of 0.2±0.5), only 30% of patients was on glucocorticoid treatment at the study entry. PL was the most compromised domain in terms of Mean Domain Z scores. As for the Domain Cognitive Dysfunction score, a deficit of PL was observed in 45% of patients and was significantly more prevalent than memory, executive and visuospatial functions impairment (P = 0.0002, P = 0.0002 and P<0.000001, respectively). According to Global Cognitive Dysfunction score, 25% of patients experienced a mild impairment and 7.5% a moderate one. Anti-phospholipid antibodies positivity was significantly associated with memory impairment (P<0.0005), whereas the presence of other neuropsychiatric events was associated with executive dysfunctions (P<0.05); no further significant association nor correlation were identified. Conclusion In this study we evaluated for the first time PL in SLE patients finding a dysfunction in almost half of patients. The dysfunction of PL was significantly more frequent than the other domains assessed."
https://openalex.org/W2989200075,"Background “Horizontal strokes should be level and vertical strokes should be straight” is a common guideline in the teaching of Chinese handwriting. Measuring deviations in level horizontal and straight vertical strokes in students’ Chinese handwriting is usually assessed manually. However, this task is time-consuming and may have inconsistent outcomes when judged by different people. In this paper, we aim to formulate a method to automatically evaluate the tilt and slant degrees of students’ Chinese handwriting using digital handwriting tablets. Furthermore, we analyze the relationship between the tilt and slant features of students’ Chinese handwriting and other demographic and handwriting features. Methods Five hundred and ninety-one primary school students from grades 1 to 6 were recruited in Hong Kong. Before the assessment, a grid paper was attached to a digital handwriting tablet. The participants were then asked to copy 90 Chinese characters from a template to the grid paper. Their handwriting processes were recorded as two-dimensional points and then analyzed. The tilt and slant of the students’ handwriting were calculated based on the inclination level of their horizontal and vertical strokes. Linear regressions between slant/tilt degree of the manuscripts and other handwriting features were performed. The students’ demographic information was also explored. Results Slant was found to be significantly correlated to Gender (p < 0.001) and tilt×standard deviation of pen pressure (p < 0.001). Tilt was found to be significantly correlated to ground time (p < 0.001), slant (p < 0.001) and slant×special education need (p = 0.021). Conclusions Our results demonstrate the relationship between slant, tilt and Chinese handwriting performance in primary school children. Slant and tilt can be adopted as an indicator in students’ special education need diagnosis, as tilt level in the students’ Chinese handwriting was related to ground time and slant× special education need, while slant is related to tilt×standard deviation of pen pressure and female students. These findings may also inspire ways to increase special education need students’ writing speed."
https://openalex.org/W2987164989,"The experimental infection of rhesus macaques (rh) with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) is an important model for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection of humans. The interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) inhibits HIV and SIV infection at the stage of host cell entry. However, it is still unclear to what extent the antiviral activity of IFITM3 observed in cell culture translates into inhibition of HIV/SIV spread in the infected host. We have shown previously that although rhIFITM3 inhibits SIV entry into cultured cells, polymorphisms in the rhIFITM3 gene are not strongly associated with viral load or disease progression in SIV infected macaques. Here, we examined whether rhIFITM3(2), which is closely related to rhIFITM3 at the sequence level, exerts antiviral activity and whether polymorphisms in the rhIFITM3(2) gene impact the course of SIV infection. We show that expression of rhIFITM3(2) is interferon-inducible and inhibits SIV entry into cells, although with reduced efficiency as compared to rhIFITM3. We further report the identification of 19 polymorphisms in the rhIFITM3(2) gene. However, analysis of a well characterized cohort of SIV infected macaques revealed that none of the polymorphisms had a significant impact upon the course of SIV infection. These results and our previous work suggest that polymorphisms in the rhIFITM3 and rhIFITM3(2) genes do not strongly modulate the course of SIV infection in macaques."
https://openalex.org/W2989318581,"Estimating a predictive model from a dataset is best initiated with an unbiased estimator. However, since the unbiased estimator is unknown in general, the problem of the bias-variance tradeoff is raised. Aside from searching for an unbiased estimator, the convenient approach to the problem of the bias-variance tradeoff may be to use the clustering method. Within a cluster whose size is smaller than the whole sample, we would expect the simple form of the estimator for prediction to avoid the overfitting problem. In this paper, we propose a new method to find the optimal cluster for prediction. Based on the previous literature, this cluster is considered to exist somewhere between the whole dataset and the typical cluster determined by partitioning data. To obtain a reliable cluster size, we use the bootstrap method in this paper. Additionally, through experiments with simulated and real-world data, we show that the prediction error can be reduced by applying this new method. We believe that our proposed method will be useful in many applications using a clustering algorithm for a stable prediction performance."
