Their search pattern approximated an optimum routing, and they rarely rechecked a place they had already emptied of food."
https://openalex.org/W1487317791,"This article reviews the available information on the place of origin and time of domestication of the cultivated pea (Pisum sativum), lentil (Lens culinaris), broad bean (Vicia faba), bitter vetch (V. ervilia), and chickpea (Cicer arietinum). On the basis of (i) an examination and evaluation of archeological remains and (ii) an identification of the wild progenitors and delimitation of their geographic distribution, it was concluded that pea and lentil should be regarded as founder crops of Old World Neolithic agriculture. Most probably they were domesticated, in the Near East, simultaneously with wheats and barley (certainly not later than the sixth millennium B.C.). Bitter vetch shows a similar mode of origin. The evidence on the broad bean and the chickpea is much more fragmentary and the wild progenitors of these legumes are yet not satisfactorily identified. But also these two pulses emerge as important food elements in Bronze Age cultures of the Near East and Europe."

https://openalex.org/W2050295842,"In the 9 years since my first survey of early metallurgy appeared in this journal (65) metallurgy has become a major battleground between those who argue independent invention and those who argue diffusion in the evolution of urban civilization. In this new article I contend that: 1) The upland belt and debouching river valleys of southwestern Asia have a clear priority in the beginnings of copper metallurgy and extractive metallurgy generally, suggesting that the forces of urbanization contributing to the rise of metallurgy there were more massive, widespread, and better integrated than elsewhere. 2) The trend to polymetallism, against the background of pyrotechnology generally and the other important technologies of urbanism, established a necessary sequence to early metallurgy. This sequence was a prerequisite to the coming of the Iron Age, which was uniquely contained at first within the environment of Anatolia and the eastern Mediterranean and spread outward from there. 3) The course of metallurgy and possibly of the other urbanizing technologies can best be understood through a process of diffusion and multiple innovation interrelating metallurgical evolution over much of Eurasia, but with the area defined by the Black Sea, the Caspian Sea, the Red Sea, and the eastern Mediterranean as its center. Only in this fashion can we place metallurgy in its proper role as an important subsystem in the rise of civilization."
https://openalex.org/W2011944453,"Pigeons were exposed to a discriminated autoshaping procedure in which brief presentation of a green light on a key was always followed by food whereas presentation of a vertical white line on the key was never followed by food. Pigeons acquired an errorless discrimination by pecking reliably in the presence of the green light but never in the presence of the line. The line inhibited pecking in later tests: when the white line was paired with food, key peck acquisition was retarded; and when the white line was superimposed on the green background, responding was suppressed."
https://openalex.org/W2059929591,"A barred chondrule in the Ngawi meteorite contains a magnetite spherule embedded in it. The collision between these two objects fractured and partially remelted the chondrule, an indication that the impact velocity was 10(5) to 10(6) centimeters per second. This observation supports Cameron's and Whipple's recent predictions that grains achieved high velocities in the nebula and that the resulting impacts provide a suitable chondrule-forming mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2128883331,"Early socialization leads to the establishment of species awareness, or imprinting, in many birds and mammals. Gallus chicks normally develop species-specific preferences prior to exposure to a parent, but early exposure is necessary to maintain these preferences. Descriptive rather than functional analyses have led to apparent disagreement about early socialization behavior; from an ecological viewpoint, such behavior is both adaptive and predictable."
https://openalex.org/W1989221071,"Because I believe that the departmental power base of universities has been a major factor in resisting inevitable and continuing changes in the disciplinary boundaries of research and teaching, I predict that significant changes in the nature of departments are inevitable. Departments will either permit, or even seek, a realignment of their spheres of control over disciplinary activity or they will lose the power of control over basic academic decisions and rewards."
https://openalex.org/W2019951309,"Apollo 16 breccia 66095 contains a remarkably high amount of lead (15 parts per million), 85 percent of which is not supported by uranium and thorium in the rock. An acid leach experiment coupled with separate analyses of the whole rock and mineral fractions for uranium, thorium, and lead indicate that the excess lead has a lunar source and was apparently introduced about 4.0 x 10(9) years ago. The data also suggest that a major lunar crustal differentiation occurred about 4.47 x 10(9) years ago."
