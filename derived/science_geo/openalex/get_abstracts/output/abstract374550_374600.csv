https://openalex.org/W1973144702,"Comparing many species' population genetic patterns across the same seascape can identify species with different levels of structure, and suggest hypotheses about the processes that cause such variation for species in the same ecosystem. This comparative approach helps focus on geographic barriers and selective or demographic processes that define genetic connectivity on an ecosystem scale, the understanding of which is particularly important for large-scale management efforts. Moreover, a multispecies dataset has great statistical advantages over single-species studies, lending explanatory power in an effort to uncover the mechanisms driving population structure. Here, we analyze a 50-species dataset of Pacific nearshore invertebrates with the aim of discovering the most influential structuring factors along the Pacific coast of North America. We collected cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) mtDNA data from populations of 34 species of marine invertebrates sampled coarsely at four coastal locations in California, Oregon, and Alaska, and added published data from 16 additional species. All nine species with non-pelagic development have strong genetic structure. For the 41 species with pelagic development, 13 show significant genetic differentiation, nine of which show striking FST levels of 0.1-0.6. Finer scale geographic investigations show unexpected regional patterns of genetic change near Cape Mendocino in northern California for five of the six species tested. The region between Oregon and Alaska is a second focus of intraspecific genetic change, showing differentiation in half the species tested. Across regions, strong genetic subdivision occurs more often than expected in mid-to-high intertidal species, a result that may reflect reduced gene flow due to natural selection along coastal environmental gradients. Finally, the results highlight the importance of making primary research accessible to policymakers, as unexpected barriers to marine dispersal break the coast into separate demographic zones that may require their own management plans."
https://openalex.org/W2078348655,"Nuclear factor-erythroid 2 p45-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a transcription factor which regulates the expression of many cytoprotective genes. In the present study, we found that the expression of Nrf2 was suppressed in prostate tumor of the Transgenic Adenocarcinoma of Mouse Prostate (TRAMP) mice. Similarly, the expression of Nrf2 and the induction of NQO1 were also substantially suppressed in tumorigenic TRAMP C1 cells but not in non-tumorigenic TRAMP C3 cells. Examination of the promoter region of the mouse Nrf2 gene identified a CpG island, which was methylated at specific CpG sites in prostate TRAMP tumor and in TRAMP C1 cells but not in normal prostate or TRAMP C3 cells, as shown by bisulfite genomic sequencing. Reporter assays indicated that methylation of these CpG sites dramatically inhibited the transcriptional activity of the Nrf2 promoter. Chromatin immunopreceipitation (ChIP) assays revealed increased binding of the methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MBD2) and trimethyl-histone H3 (Lys9) proteins to these CpG sites in the TRAMP C1 cells as compared to TRAMP C3 cells. In contrast, the binding of RNA Pol II and acetylated histone H3 to the Nrf2 promoter was decreased. Furthermore, treatment of TRAMP C1 cells with DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-aza) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) restored the expression of Nrf2 as well as the induction of NQO1 in TRAMP C1 cells. Taken together, these results indicate that the expression of Nrf2 is suppressed epigenetically by promoter methylation associated with MBD2 and histone modifications in the prostate tumor of TRAMP mice. Our present findings reveal a novel mechanism by which Nrf2 expression is suppressed in TRAMP prostate tumor, shed new light on the role of Nrf2 in carcinogenesis and provide potential new directions for the detection and prevention of prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2094205902,"Mycobacteria are a group of obligate aerobes that require oxygen for growth, but paradoxically have the ability to survive and metabolize under hypoxia. The mechanisms responsible for this metabolic plasticity are unknown. Here, we report on the adaptation of Mycobacterium smegmatis to slow growth rate and hypoxia using carbon-limited continuous culture. When M. smegmatis is switched from a 4.6 h to a 69 h doubling time at a constant oxygen saturation of 50%, the cells respond through the down regulation of respiratory chain components and the F1Fo-ATP synthase, consistent with the cells lower demand for energy at a reduced growth rate. This was paralleled by an up regulation of molecular machinery that allowed more efficient energy generation (i.e. Complex I) and the use of alternative electron donors (e.g. hydrogenases and primary dehydrogenases) to maintain the flow of reducing equivalents to the electron transport chain during conditions of severe energy limitation. A hydrogenase mutant showed a 40% reduction in growth yield highlighting the importance of this enzyme in adaptation to low energy supply. Slow growing cells at 50% oxygen saturation subjected to hypoxia (0.6% oxygen saturation) responded by switching on oxygen scavenging cytochrome bd, proton-translocating cytochrome bc1-aa3 supercomplex, another putative hydrogenase, and by substituting NAD+-dependent enzymes with ferredoxin-dependent enzymes thus highlighting a new pattern of mycobacterial adaptation to hypoxia. The expression of ferredoxins and a hydrogenase provides a potential conduit for disposing of and transferring electrons in the absence of exogenous electron acceptors. The use of ferredoxin-dependent enzymes would allow the cell to maintain a high carbon flux through its central carbon metabolism independent of the NAD+/NADH ratio. These data demonstrate the remarkable metabolic plasticity of the mycobacterial cell and provide a new framework for understanding their ability to survive under low energy conditions and hypoxia."

https://openalex.org/W1980750965,"Breast carcinoma invasion is associated with prominent alterations in stromal fibroblasts. Carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAF) support and promote tumorigenesis, whereas normal mammary fibroblasts (NF) are thought to suppress tumor progression. Little is known about the difference in gene expression between CAF and NF or the patient-to-patient variability in gene expression. Paired CAF and NF were isolated from six primary human breast carcinoma specimens. RNA was extracted from low-passage cultures of CAF and NF and analyzed with Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 arrays. The array data were examined with an empirical Bayes model and filtered according to the posterior probability of equivalent expression and fold difference in expression. Twenty-one genes (27 probe sets) were up-regulated in CAF, as compared with NF. Known functions of these genes relate to paracrine or intracellular signaling, transcriptional regulation, extracellular matrix and cell adhesion/migration. Ten genes (14 probe sets) were down-regulated in CAF, including the pluripotency transcription factor KLF4. Quantitative RT–PCR analysis of 10 genes validated the array results. Immunohistochemical staining for three gene products confirmed stromal expression in terms of location and relative quantity. Surprisingly, the variability of gene expression was slightly higher in NF than in CAF, suggesting inter-individual heterogeneity of normal stroma."
https://openalex.org/W2080245596,"Background Pretreatment with 17β-estradiol (E2) is profoundly neuroprotective in young animals subjected to focal and global ischemia. However, whether E2 retains its neuroprotective efficacy in aging animals, especially when administered after brain insult, is largely unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings We examined the neuroprotective effects of E2 and two agonists that bind to non-classical estrogen receptors, G1 and STX, when administered after ischemia in middle-aged rats after prolonged ovarian hormone withdrawal. Eight weeks after ovariectomy, middle-aged female rats underwent 10 minutes of global ischemia by four vessel occlusion. Immediately after reperfusion, animals received a single infusion of either E2 (2.25 µg), G1 (50 µg) or STX (50 µg) into the lateral ventricle (ICV) or a single systemic injection of E2 (100 µg/kg). Surviving pyramidal neurons in the hippocampal CA1 were quantified 1 week later. E2 and both agonists that target non-classical estrogen receptors (G1 and STX) administered ICV at the time of reperfusion provided significant levels of neuroprotection, with 55–60% of CA1 neurons surviving vs 15% survival in controls. A single systemic injection of a pharmacological dose of E2 also rescued approximately 50% of CA1 pyramidal neurons destined to die. To determine if E2 and G1 have similar mechanisms of action in hippocampal neurons, we compared the ability of E2 and G1 to modify CA1 pyramidal neuron responses to excitatory inputs from the Schaffer collaterals recorded in hippocampal slices derived from female rats not subjected to global ischemia. E2 and G1 (10 nM) significantly potentiated pyramidal neuron responses to excitatory inputs when applied to hippocampal slices. Conclusions/Significance These findings suggest (1) that middle-aged female rats retain their responsiveness to E2 even after a long period of hormone withdrawal, (2) that non-classical estrogen receptors may mediate the neuroprotective actions of E2 when given after ischemia, and (3) that the neuroprotective efficacy of estrogens may be related to their modulation of synaptic activity in hippocampal slices."
https://openalex.org/W2011736725,"Background Recent studies have suggested that autophagy is utilized by cells as a protective mechanism against Listeria monocytogenes infection. Methodology/Principal Findings However we find autophagy has no measurable role in vacuolar escape and intracellular growth in primary cultured bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) deficient for autophagy (atg5−/−). Nevertheless, we provide evidence that the pore forming activity of the cholesterol-dependent cytolysin listeriolysin O (LLO) can induce autophagy subsequent to infection by L. monocytogenes. Infection of BMDMs with L. monocytogenes induced microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3) lipidation, consistent with autophagy activation, whereas a mutant lacking LLO did not. Infection of BMDMs that express LC3-GFP demonstrated that wild-type L. monocytogenes was encapsulated by LC3-GFP, consistent with autophagy activation, whereas a mutant lacking LLO was not. Bacillus subtilis expressing either LLO or a related cytolysin, perfringolysin O (PFO), induced LC3 colocalization and LC3 lipidation. Further, LLO-containing liposomes also recruited LC3-GFP, indicating that LLO was sufficient to induce targeted autophagy in the absence of infection. The role of autophagy had variable effects depending on the cell type assayed. In atg5−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts, L. monocytogenes had a primary vacuole escape defect. However, the bacteria escaped and grew normally in atg5−/− BMDMs. Conclusions/Significance We propose that membrane damage, such as that caused by LLO, triggers bacterial-targeted autophagy, although autophagy does not affect the fate of wild-type intracellular L. monocytogenes in primary BMDMs."
https://openalex.org/W2086787730,"Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus is a Gram-negative bacterium that is a pathogen of other Gram-negative bacteria, including many bacteria which are pathogens of humans, animals and plants. As such Bdellovibrio has potential as a biocontrol agent, or living antibiotic. B. bacteriovorus HD100 has a large genome and it is not yet known which of it encodes the molecular machinery and genetic control of predatory processes. We have tried to fill this knowledge-gap using mixtures of predator and prey mRNAs to monitor changes in Bdellovibrio gene expression at a timepoint of early-stage prey infection and prey killing in comparison to control cultures of predator and prey alone and also in comparison to Bdellovibrio growing axenically (in a prey-or host independent “HI” manner) on artificial media containing peptone and tryptone. From this we have highlighted genes of the early predatosome with predicted roles in prey killing and digestion and have gained insights into possible regulatory mechanisms as Bdellovibrio enter and establish within the prey bdelloplast. Approximately seven percent of all Bdellovibrio genes were significantly up-regulated at 30 minutes of infection- but not in HI growth- implicating the role of these genes in prey digestion. Five percent were down-regulated significantly, implicating their role in free-swimming, attack-phase physiology. This study gives the first post- genomic insight into the predatory process and reveals some of the important genes that Bdellovibrio expresses inside the prey bacterium during the initial attack."
https://openalex.org/W2147860206,"Background The gaseous plant hormone ethylene is perceived in Arabidopsis thaliana by a five-member receptor family composed of ETR1, ERS1, ETR2, ERS2, and EIN4. Methodology/Principal Findings Gel-filtration analysis of ethylene receptors solubilized from Arabidopsis membranes demonstrates that the receptors exist as components of high-molecular-mass protein complexes. The ERS1 protein complex exhibits an ethylene-induced change in size consistent with ligand-mediated nucleation of protein-protein interactions. Deletion analysis supports the participation of multiple domains from ETR1 in formation of the protein complex, and also demonstrates that targeting to and retention of ETR1 at the endoplasmic reticulum only requires the first 147 amino acids of the receptor. A role for disulfide bonds in stabilizing the ETR1 protein complex was demonstrated by use of reducing agents and mutation of Cys4 and Cys6 of ETR1. Expression and analysis of ETR1 in a transgenic yeast system demonstrates the importance of Cys4 and Cys6 of ETR1 in stabilizing the receptor for ethylene binding. Conclusions/Significance These data support the participation of ethylene receptors in obligate as well as ligand-dependent non-obligate protein interactions. These data also suggest that different protein complexes may allow for tailoring of the ethylene signal to specific cellular environments and responses."
https://openalex.org/W2072379815,"Cells with stem cell properties have been isolated from various areas of the postnatal mammalian brain, most recently from the postnatal mouse cerebellum. We show here that inactivation of the tumor suppressor genes Rb and p53 in these endogenous neural stem cells induced deregulated proliferation and resistance to apoptosis in vitro. Moreover, injection of these cells into mice formed medulloblastomas. Medulloblastomas are the most common malignant brain tumors of childhood, and despite recent advances in treatment they are associated with high morbidity and mortality. They are highly heterogeneous tumors characterized by a diverse genetic make-up and expression profile as well as variable prognosis. Here, we describe a novel ontogenetic pathway of medulloblastoma that significantly contributes to understanding their heterogeneity. Experimental medulloblastomas originating from neural stem cells preferentially expressed stem cell markers Nestin, Sox2 and Sox9, which were not expressed in medulloblastomas originating from granule-cell-restricted progenitors. Furthermore, the expression of these markers identified a subset of human medulloblastomas associated with a poorer clinical outcome."
https://openalex.org/W2057874135,"Mutations in the FOXP2 transcription factor lead to language disorders with developmental onset. Accompanying structural abnormalities in cortico-striatal circuitry indicate that at least a portion of the behavioral phenotype is due to organizational deficits. We previously found parallel FoxP2 expression patterns in human and songbird cortico/pallio-striatal circuits important for learned vocalizations, suggesting that FoxP2's function in birdsong may generalize to speech.We used zebra finches to address the question of whether FoxP2 is additionally important in the post-organizational function of these circuits. In both humans and songbirds, vocal learning depends on auditory guidance to achieve and maintain optimal vocal output. We tested whether deafening prior to or during the sensorimotor phase of song learning disrupted FoxP2 expression in song circuitry. As expected, the songs of deafened juveniles were abnormal, however basal FoxP2 levels were unaffected. In contrast, when hearing or deaf juveniles sang for two hours in the morning, FoxP2 was acutely down-regulated in the striatal song nucleus, area X. The extent of down-regulation was similar between hearing and deaf birds. Interestingly, levels of FoxP2 and singing were correlated only in hearing birds.Hearing appears to link FoxP2 levels to the amount of vocal practice. As juvenile birds spent more time practicing than did adults, their FoxP2 levels are likely to be low more often. Behaviorally-driven reductions in the mRNA encoding this transcription factor could ultimately affect downstream molecules that function in vocal exploration, especially during sensorimotor learning."
https://openalex.org/W2065606193,"The methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) clonal group known as ST239-MRSA-III is notable for its hybrid origin and for causing sustained hospital epidemics worldwide since the late 1970s. We studied the population structure of this MRSA clonal group using a sample of 111 isolates that were collected over 34 years from 29 countries. Genetic variation was assessed using typing methods and novel ascertainment methods, resulting in approximately 15 kb of sequence from 32 loci for all isolates. A single most parsimonious tree, free of homoplasy, partitioned 28 haplotypes into geographically-associated clades, including prominent European, Asian, and South American clades. The rate of evolution was estimated to be approximately 100× faster than standard estimates for bacteria, and dated the most recent common ancestor of these isolates to the mid-20th century. Associations were discovered between the ST239 phylogeny and the ccrB and dru loci of the methicillin resistance genetic element, SCCmec type III, but not with the accessory components of the element that are targeted by multiplex PCR subtyping tools. In summary, the evolutionary history of ST239 can be characterized by rapid clonal diversification that has left strong evidence of geographic and temporal population structure. SCCmec type III has remained linked to the ST239 chromosome during clonal diversification, but it has undergone homoplasious losses of accessory components. These results provide a population genetics framework for the precise identification of emerging ST239 variants, and invite a re-evaluation of the markers used for subtyping SCCmec."
https://openalex.org/W2018763825,"Juvenile salmon have an olfactory ability to imprint their natal stream odors, but neither the odor properties of natal stream water nor the imprinting timing and duration have been clarified as yet. Here we show, using electrophysiological and behavioral experiments, that one-year-old lacustrine sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) can be imprinted around the stage of parr-smolt transformation (PST) by a single amino acid, 1 microM L-proline (Pro), or L-glutamic acid (Glu). We also show by real-time PCR that changes occur in mRNA levels of the salmon olfactory imprinting-related gene (SOIG) around PST. The electro-olfactogram (EOG) responses of test fish exposed to Pro in March (before PST) and April-June (during PST) for 2 weeks were significantly (1.7-fold) greater than those of non-exposed control fish, but not those of test fish exposed in July (after PST). When Pro and control water were added to the water inlets of a two-choice test tank during the spawning season 2 years after the test water exposure, 80% of maturing and matured test fish exposed before and during PST showed a preference for Pro, whereas those exposed after PST did not. The EOG response of test fish exposed to Pro or Glu for 1 hour, 6 hours, 1 day, 7 days, or 14 days in May revealed that only the response after 14 days of exposure was significantly (1.8-fold) greater than the control. The expression levels of SOIG mRNA increased before and during PST, and decreased after PST. We conclude that one-year-old lacustrine sockeye salmon can be imprinted by a single amino acid before and during PST, and that imprinting requires exposure for at least 14 days."

https://openalex.org/W2020921095,"BCL2 family members affect cell fate decisions in breast cancer but the role of BCL-W (BCL2L2) is unknown. We now show the integrated roles of the antiapoptotic BCL-W and BCL2 in affecting responsiveness to the antiestrogen ICI 182,780 (ICI; Fulvestrant Faslodex), using both molecular (siRNA; shRNA) and pharmacologic (YC137) approaches in three breast cancer variants; MCF-7/LCC1 (ICI sensitive), MCF-7/LCC9 (ICI resistant), and LY2 (ICI resistant). YC137 inhibits BCL-W and BCL2 and restores ICI sensitivity in resistant cells. Co-inhibition of BCL-W and BCL2 is both necessary and sufficient to restore sensitivity to ICI, and explains mechanistically the action of YC137. These data implicate functional cooperation and/or redundancy in signaling between BCL-W and BCL2, and suggest that broad BCL2 family member inhibitors will have greater therapeutic value than targeting only individual proteins. Whereas ICI sensitive MCF-7/LCC1 cells undergo increased apoptosis in response to ICI following BCL-W±BCL2 co-inhibition, the consequent resensitization of resistant MCF-7/LCC9 and LY2 cells reflects increases in autophagy (LC3 cleavage; p62/SQSTM1 expression) and necrosis but not apoptosis or cell cycle arrest. Thus, de novo sensitive cells and resensitized resistant cells die through different mechanisms. Following BCL-W+BCL2 co-inhibition, suppression of functional autophagy by 3-methyladenine or BECN1 shRNA reduces ICI-induced necrosis but restores the ability of resistant cells to die through apoptosis. These data demonstrate the plasticity of cell fate mechanisms in breast cancer cells in the context of antiestrogen responsiveness. Restoration of ICI sensitivity in resistant cells appears to occur through an increase in autophagy-associated necrosis. BCL-W, BCL2, and BECN1 integrate important functions in determining antiestrogen responsiveness, and the presence of functional autophagy may influence the balance between apoptosis and necrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2110739875,"Mitochondria are organelles derived from an intracellular α-proteobacterium. The biogenesis of mitochondria relies on the assembly of β-barrel proteins into the mitochondrial outer membrane, a process inherited from the bacterial ancestor. Caulobacter crescentus is an α-proteobacterium, and the BAM (β-barrel assembly machinery) complex was purified and characterized from this model organism. Like the mitochondrial sorting and assembly machinery complex, we find the BAM complex to be modular in nature. A ∼150 kDa core BAM complex containing BamA, BamB, BamD, and BamE associates with additional modules in the outer membrane. One of these modules, Pal, is a lipoprotein that provides a means for anchorage to the peptidoglycan layer of the cell wall. We suggest the modular design of the BAM complex facilitates access to substrates from the protein translocase in the inner membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1983044159,"The stimulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis by antidepressants has been associated with multiple molecular pathways, but the potential influence exerted by other brain areas has received much less attention. The basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA), a region involved in anxiety and a site of action of antidepressants, has been implicated in both basal and stress-induced changes in neural plasticity in the dentate gyrus. We investigated here whether the BLA modulates the effects of the SSRI antidepressant fluoxetine on hippocampal cell proliferation and survival in relation to a behavioral index of depression-like behavior (forced swim test). We used a lesion approach targeting the BLA along with a chronic treatment with fluoxetine, and monitored basal anxiety levels given the important role of this behavioral trait in the progress of depression. Chronic fluoxetine treatment had a positive effect on hippocampal cell survival only when the BLA was lesioned. Anxiety was related to hippocampal cell survival in opposite ways in sham- and BLA-lesioned animals (i.e., negatively in sham- and positively in BLA-lesioned animals). Both BLA lesions and low anxiety were critical factors to enable a negative relationship between cell proliferation and depression-like behavior. Therefore, our study highlights a role for the amygdala on fluoxetine-stimulated cell survival and on the establishment of a link between cell proliferation and depression-like behavior. It also reveals an important modulatory role for anxiety on cell proliferation involving both BLA-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Our findings underscore the amygdala as a potential target to modulate antidepressants' action in hippocampal neurogenesis and in their link to depression-like behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W2020110258,"Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) is involved in multiple brain functions. To clarify the cause of abnormal behavior in PACAP deficient-mice, we attempted the identification of genes whose expression was altered in the dentate gyrus of PACAP-deficient mice using the differential display method. Expression of stathmin1 was up-regulated in the dentate gyrus at both the mRNA and protein levels. PACAP stimulation inhibited stathmin1 expression in PC12 cells, while increased stathmin1expression in neurons of the subgranular zone and in primary cultured hippocampal neurons induced abnormal arborization of axons. We also investigated the pathways involved in PACAP deficiency. Ascl1 binds to E10 box of the stathmin1 promoter and increases stathmin1 expression. Inhibitory bHLH proteins (Hes1 and Id3) were rapidly up-regulated by PACAP stimulation, and Hes1 could suppress Ascl1 expression and Id3 could inhibit Ascl1 signaling. We also detected an increase of stathmin1 expression in the brains of schizophrenic patients. These results suggest that up-regulation of stathmin1 in the dentate gyrus, secondary to PACAP deficiency, may create abnormal neuronal circuits that cause abnormal behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2013520973,"Cell cycle controls ensure that DNA replication (S phase) follows mitosis resulting in two precise copies of the genome. A failure of the control mechanisms can result in multiple rounds of DNA replication without cell division. In endoreplication, cells with replicated genomes bypass mitosis, then replicate their DNA again, resulting in polyploidy. Endoreplication from G2 phase lacks all hallmarks of mitosis. Using synchronized cells, we show that the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor, SP600125, prevents the entry of cells into mitosis and leads to endoreplication of DNA from G2 phase. We show that cells proceed from G2 phase to replicate their DNA in the absence of mitosis. This effect of SP600125 is independent of its suppression of JNK activity. Instead, the inhibitory effect of SP600125 on mitotic entry predominantly occurs upstream of Aurora A kinase and Polo-like kinase 1, resulting in a failure to remove the inhibitory phosphorylation of Cdk1. Importantly, our results directly show that the inhibition of Cdk1 activity and the persistence of Cdk2 activity in G2 cells induces endoreplication without mitosis. Furthermore, endoreplication from G2 phase is independent of p53 control."
https://openalex.org/W2110892195,"Aberrant expression and mutations of thyroid hormone receptor genes (TRs) are closely associated with several types of human cancers. To test the hypothesis that TRs could function as tumor suppressors, we took advantage of mice with deletion of all functional TRs (TRα1−/−TRβ−/− mice). As these mice aged, they spontaneously developed follicular thyroid carcinoma with pathological progression from hyperplasia to capsular invasion, vascular invasion, anaplasia and metastasis to the lung, similar to human thyroid cancer. Detailed molecular analysis revealed that known tumor promoters such as pituitary tumor-transforming gene were activated and tumor suppressors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ and p53 were suppressed during carcinogenesis. In addition, consistent with the human cancer, AKT–mTOR–p70S6K signaling and vascular growth factor and its receptor were activated to facilitate tumor progression. This report presents in vivo evidence that functional loss of both TRα1 and TRβ genes promotes tumor development and metastasis. Thus, TRs could function as tumor suppressors in a mouse model of metastatic follicular thyroid cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2019461856,"Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) is a potent neuroprotective cytokine in different animal models of glutamate-induced excitotoxicity, although its action mechanisms are still poorly characterized. We tested the hypothesis that an increased function of glial glutamate transporters (GTs) could underlie CNTF-mediated neuroprotection. We show that neuronal loss induced by in vivo striatal injection of the excitotoxin quinolinic acid (QA) was significantly reduced (by approximately 75%) in CNTF-treated animals. In striatal slices, acute QA application dramatically inhibited corticostriatal field potentials (FPs), whose recovery was significantly higher in CNTF rats compared to controls (approximately 40% vs. approximately 7%), confirming an enhanced resistance to excitotoxicity. The GT inhibitor DL-threo-beta-benzyloxyaspartate greatly reduced FP recovery in CNTF rats, supporting the role of GT in CNTF-mediated neuroprotection. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from striatal medium spiny neurons showed no alteration of basic properties of striatal glutamatergic transmission in CNTF animals, but the increased effect of a low-affinity competitive glutamate receptor antagonist (gamma-D-glutamylglycine) also suggested an enhanced GT function. These data strongly support our hypothesis that CNTF is neuroprotective via an increased function of glial GTs, and further confirms the therapeutic potential of CNTF for the clinical treatment of progressive neurodegenerative diseases involving glutamate overflow."

https://openalex.org/W2079126104,"In this study, we report that the PEA3 group members interact with the mammalian really interesting new gene (RING) E3 ubiquitin ligase constitutive photomorphogenetic 1 (COP1), which mediates ubiquitylation and subsequent proteasome degradation of the p53 and c-Jun transcription factors. This interaction is mediated by the central region of COP1 including the coiled-coil domain and two COP1-interacting consensus motifs localized in the well-conserved N-terminal transactivation domain of the PEA3 group members. At the transcriptional level, COP1 reduces the transcriptional activity of ERM and the two other PEA3 group proteins on Ets-responsive reporter genes; this effect being dependent on the RING domain of COP1 and the two COP1-interacting motifs of ERM. Reduced transcriptional activity was, however, not related to COP1-induced changes in ERM stability. In fact, increased ubiquitylation and subsequent proteasome-mediated degradation of ERM is achieved only when COP1 is expressed with DET1, a key COP1 partner within the ubiquitylation complex. Conversely, we show that the depletion of COP1 or DET1 by small interference RNA (siRNA) in U2OS cells stabilizes endogenous ERM whereas only COP1 knockdown enhances expression of ICAM-1, a gene regulated by this transcription factor. These results indicate that COP1 is a complex regulator of ERM and the two other PEA3 group members."
https://openalex.org/W2122009358,"Background Mathematical models of tuberculosis (TB) transmission have been used to characterize disease dynamics, investigate the potential effects of public health interventions, and prioritize control measures. While previous work has addressed the mathematical description of TB natural history, the impact of demography on the behaviour of TB models has not been assessed. Methods A simple model of TB transmission, with alternative assumptions about survivorship, is used to explore the effect of age structure on the prevalence of infection, disease, basic reproductive ratio and the projected impact of control interventions. We focus our analytic arguments on the differences between constant and exponentially distributed lifespans and use an individual-based model to investigate the range of behaviour arising from realistic distributions of survivorship. Results The choice of age structure and natural (non-disease related) mortality strongly affects steady-state dynamics, parameter estimation and predictions about the effectiveness of control interventions. Since most individuals infected with TB develop an asymptomatic latent infection and never progress to active disease, we find that assuming a constant mortality rate results in a larger reproductive ratio and an overestimation of the effort required for disease control in comparison to using more realistic age-specific mortality rates. Conclusions Demographic modelling assumptions should be considered in the interpretation of models of chronic infectious diseases such as TB. For simple models, we find that assuming constant lifetimes, rather than exponential lifetimes, produces dynamics more representative of models with realistic age structure."
https://openalex.org/W2064575361,"The tumor suppressive activities of the Kip-family of cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) inhibitors often go beyond their role directly regulating the cell cycle. In this study, we show that p27 enhances Rad51 accumulation during repair of double-strand DNA breaks. Progression of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-induced oligodendrogliomas was accelerated in mice lacking the cyclin–cdk binding activities of p27kip1. To understand how p27 deficiency contributes, cell lines were developed from RCAS–PDGF infection of nestin-tv-a brain progenitor cells in culture. p27 deficiency did not affect cell proliferation in early passage cell lines; however, the absence of p27 affected chromosomal stability. In p27-deficient cells, the activation of Atm and Chk2 and the accumulation of γ-H2AX was unaffected when compared with wild-type cells, and the number of phospho-histone H3 staining mitotic cells was decreased, consistent with G2/M checkpoint activation. However, the percentage of Rad51 foci-positive cells was decreased, and the kinase activity that targets the C-terminus of BRCA2, regulating BRCA2/Rad51 interactions, was increased in lysates derived from p27-deficient cells. Increased numbers of chromatid breaks in p27-deficient cells that adapted to the checkpoint were also observed. These findings suggest that Rad51-dependent repair of double-stranded breaks was hindered in p27-deficient cells, leading to chromosomal instability, a hallmark of cancers with poor prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W1998416626,"The availability of specific markers expressed in different regions of the developing nervous system provides a useful tool to illuminate their development, regulation and function. We have identified by expression profiling a putative non-coding RNA, Rmst, that exhibits prominent expression in the midbrain floor plate region, the isthmus and the roof plate of the anterior neural tube. At the developmental stage when the ventral dopaminergic neuron territory is being established, Rmst expression appears to be restricted to the presumptive dopaminergic neurons of the ventral tegmental area that lies close to the ventral midline. Thus this study presents Rmst as a novel marker for the developing dopaminergic neurons in the mesencephalic floor plate as well as a marker for the dorsal midline cells of the anterior neural tube and the isthmic organizer."

A disadvantage of the method is the long time required to generate visible colonies from cells in a sample. New rapid testing technologies generally have failed to maintain one or more of the major advantages of culture-based methods.We present a new technology and platform that uses digital imaging of cellular autofluorescence to detect and enumerate growing microcolonies many generations before they become visible to the eye. The data presented demonstrate that the method preserves the viability of the microcolonies it detects, thus enabling generation of pure cultures for microbial identification. While visual colony counting detects Escherichia coli colonies containing about 5x10(6) cells, the new imaging method detects E. coli microcolonies when they contain about 120 cells and microcolonies of the yeast Candida albicans when they contain only about 12 cells. We demonstrate that digital imaging of microcolony autofluorescence detects a broad spectrum of prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbes and present a model for predicting the time to detection for individual strains. Results from the analysis of environmental samples from pharmaceutical manufacturing plants containing a mixture of unidentified microbes demonstrate the method's improved test turnaround times.This work demonstrates a new technology and automated platform that substantially shortens test times while maintaining key advantages of the current methods."
https://openalex.org/W2060525899,"Xeroderma pigmentosum group F (XPF) has an essential role in the nucleotide excision repair pathway that removes a wide variety of DNA lesions. We hypothesized that genetic variants in XPF are associated with bladder cancer risk and recurrence. We selected three tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (tagSNPs) from the HapMap database for the Chinese and genotyped them in a two-stage case-control study to evaluate the association and further examined the functionality of a novel polymorphism in the promoter. The two-stage analysis found that the rs744154 tagSNP in the XPF intron 1, which was linkage disequilibrium with the -357A>C polymorphism in the promoter region, was associated with a protective effect on bladder cancer risk. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) further revealed that the -357C allele decreased the binding ability of transcriptional factors to the XPF promoter. The vector construct containing the -357C allele had a lower luciferase expression than did the -357A allele. The -357C allele in the transcription factor-binding site was also associated with decreased expression levels of both XPF mRNA and protein in bladder cancer tissues. Furthermore, patients with the -357C allele had a shorter overall recurrence-free survival than did patients with the -357A allele. Our results suggest that the XPF promoter -357A>C polymorphism may regulate the expression of XPF and thereby contribute to susceptibility to and prognosis of bladder cancer. Further larger studies with different populations are warranted to confirm these findings."

https://openalex.org/W2086593306,"Background The retinal determination (RD) network is an evolutionarily conserved regulatory circuit that governs early events in the development of eyes throughout the animal kingdom. Ectopic expression of many members of this network leads to the transformation of non-retinal epithelia into eye tissue. An often-overlooked observation is that only particular cell-populations within a handful of tissues are capable of having their primary developmental instructions superseded and overruled. Methodology/Preliminary Findings Here we confirm that indeed, only a discrete number of cell populations within the imaginal discs that give rise to the head, antenna, legs, wings and halteres have the cellular plasticity to have their developmental fates altered. In contrast to previous reports, we find that all transformable cell populations do not lie within the TGFβ or Hedgehog signaling domains. Additionally neither signaling cascade alone is sufficient for non-retinal cell types to be converted into retinal tissue. The transformation “hot spots” that we have identified appear to coincide with several previously defined transdetermination “weak spots”, suggesting that ectopic eye formation is less the result of one network overriding the orders of another, as previously thought, but rather is the physical manifestation of redirecting cell populations of enormous cellular plasticity. We also demonstrate that the initiation of eye formation in non-retinal tissues occurs asynchronously compared to that of the normal eye suggesting that retinal development is not under the control of a global developmental clock. Conclusions/Significance We conclude that the subregions of non-retinal tissues that are capable of supporting eye formation represent specialized cell-populations that have a different level of plasticity than other cells within these tissues and may be the founder cells of each tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2095127010,"Recent studies have shown that orexins play a critical role in the regulation of sleep/wake states, feeding behaviour, and reward processes. The exocrine and endocrine pancreas are involved in the regulation of food metabolism and energy balance. This function is deranged in diabetes mellitus. This study examined the pattern of distribution of orexin-1 receptor (OX1R) in the endocrine cells of the pancreas of normal and diabetic Wistar (a model of type 1 diabetes), Goto-Kakizaki (GK, a model of type 2 diabetes) rats and in orexin-deficient (OX−/−) and wild type mice. Diabetes mellitus (DM) was induced in Wistar rats and mice by streptozotocin (STZ). At different time points (12 h, 24 h, 4 weeks, 8 months and 15 months) after the induction of DM, pancreatic fragments of normal and diabetic rats were processed for immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. OX1R-immunoreactive nerves were observed in the pancreas of normal and diabetic Wistar rats. OX1R was also discernible in the pancreatic islets of normal and diabetic Wistar and GK rats, and wild type mice. OX1R co-localized with insulin (INS) and glucagon (GLU) in the pancreas of Wistar and GK rats. The number of OX1R-positive cells in the islets increased markedly (p<0.0001) after the onset of DM. The increase in the number of OX1R-positive cells is associated with a high degree of co-localization with GLU. The number of GLU- positive cells expressing OX1R was significantly (p<0.0001) higher after the onset of DM. The tissue level of OX1R protein increased with the duration of DM especially in type 1 diabetes where it co-localized with cleaved caspase 3 in islet cells. In comparison to STZ-treated wild type mice, STZ-treated OX−/− animals exhibited reduced hyperglycemia and handled glucose more efficiently in glucose tolerance test. The findings suggest an important role for the OX-OX1R pathway in STZ-induced experimental diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2088848963,"The p53 tumor suppressor inhibits the proliferation of cells that undergo prolonged activation of the mitotic checkpoint. However, the function of this antiproliferative response is not well defined. Here, we report that p53 suppresses structural chromosome instability after mitotic arrest in human cells. In both HCT116 colon cancer cells and normal human fibroblasts, DNA breaks occurred during mitotic arrest in a p53-independent manner, but p53 was required to suppress the proliferation and structural chromosome instability of the resulting polyploid cells. In contrast, cells made polyploid without mitotic arrest exhibited neither significant structural chromosome instability nor p53-dependent cell cycle arrest. We also observed that p53 suppressed both the frequency and structural chromosome instability of spontaneous polyploids in HCT116 cells. Furthermore, time-lapse videomicroscopy revealed that polyploidization of p53−/− HCT116 cells is frequently accompanied by mitotic arrest. These data suggest that a function of the p53-dependent postmitotic response is the prevention of structural chromosome instability after prolonged activation of the mitotic checkpoint. Accordingly, our study suggests a novel mechanism of tumor suppression for p53, as well as a potential function for p53 in the outcome of antimitotic chemotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2078884966,"The molecular composition of the hair cell transduction channel has not been identified. Here we explore the novel hypothesis that hair cell transduction channels include HCN subunits. The HCN family of ion channels includes four members, HCN1-4. They were orginally identified as the molecular correlates of the hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic nucleotide gated ion channels that carry currents known as If, IQ or Ih. However, based on recent evidence it has been suggested that HCN subunits may also be components of the elusive hair cell transduction channel. To investigate this hypothesis we examined expression of mRNA that encodes HCN1-4 in sensory epithelia of the mouse inner ear, immunolocalization of HCN subunits 1, 2 and 4, uptake of the transduction channel permeable dye, FM1-43 and electrophysiological measurement of mechanotransduction current. Dye uptake and transduction current were assayed in cochlear and vestibular hair cells of wildtype mice exposed to HCN channel blockers or a dominant-negative form of HCN2 that contained a pore mutation and in mutant mice that lacked HCN1, HCN2 or both. We found robust expression of HCNs 1, 2 and 4 but little evidence that localized HCN subunits in hair bundles, the site of mechanotransduction. Although high concentrations of the HCN antagonist, ZD7288, blocked 50–70% of the transduction current, we found no reduction of transduction current in either cochlear or vestibular hair cells of HCN1- or HCN2- deficient mice relative to wild-type mice. Furthermore, mice that lacked both HCN1 and HCN2 also had normal transduction currents. Lastly, we found that mice exposed to the dominant-negative mutant form of HCN2 had normal transduction currents as well. Taken together, the evidence suggests that HCN subunits are not required for mechanotransduction in hair cells of the mouse inner ear."
https://openalex.org/W2125666511,"African animal trypanosomiasis is caused by a range of tsetse transmitted protozoan parasites includingTrypanosoma vivax, Trypanosoma congolense and Trypansoma brucei. In Western Kenya and other parts of East Africa two subspecies of T. brucei, T.b. brucei and the zoonoticT.b. rhodesiense, co-circulate in livestock. A range of polymerase chain reactions (PCR) have been developed as important molecular diagnostic tools for epidemiological investigations of T. brucei s.l. in the animal reservoir and of its zoonotic potential. Quantification of the relative performance of different diagnostic PCRs is essential to ensure comparability of studies. This paper describes an evaluation of two diagnostic test systems for T. brucei using a T. brucei s.l. specific PCR [1] and a single nested PCR targeting the Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) regions of trypanosome ribosomal DNA [2]. A Bayesian formulation of the Hui-Walter latent class model was employed to estimate their test performance in the absence of a gold standard test for detecting T.brucei s.l. infections in ear-vein blood samples from cattle, pig, sheep and goat populations in Western Kenya, stored on Whatman FTA cards. The results indicate that the system employing the T. brucei s.l. specific PCR (Se1 = 0.760) had a higher sensitivity than the ITS-PCR (Se2 = 0.640); both have high specificity (Sp1 = 0.998; Sp2 = 0.997). The true prevalences for livestock populations were estimated (pcattle = 0.091, ppigs = 0.066, pgoats = 0.005, psheep = 0.006), taking into account the uncertainties in the specificity and sensitivity of the two test systems. Implications of test performance include the required survey sample size; due to its higher sensitivity and specificity, the T. brucei s.l. specific PCR requires a consistently smaller sample size than the ITS-PCR for the detection of T. brucei s.l. However the ITS-PCR is able to simultaneously screen samples for other pathogenic trypanosomes and may thus be, overall, a better choice of test in multi-organism studies."
https://openalex.org/W1963749323,"Nicotine from smoking tobacco produces one of the most common forms of addictive behavior and has major societal and health consequences. It is known that nicotine triggers tobacco addiction by activating nicotine acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in the midbrain dopaminergic reward system, primarily via the ventral tegmental area. Heterogeneity of cell populations in the region has made it difficult for pharmacology-based analyses to precisely assess the functional significance of glutamatergic inputs to dopamine neurons in nicotine addiction. By generating dopamine neuron-specific NR1 knockout mice using cre/loxP-mediated method, we demonstrate that genetic inactivation of the NMDA receptors in ventral tegmental area dopamine neurons selectively prevents nicotine-conditioned place preference. Interestingly, the mutant mice exhibit normal performances in the conditioned place aversion induced by aversive air puffs. Therefore, this selective effect on addictive drug-induced reinforcement behavior suggests that NMDA receptors in the dopamine neurons are critical for the development of nicotine addiction."

Improved treatment strategies are needed if individuals are to benefit from the increasing availability of antiretroviral therapy. We investigated the factors associated with mortality in routine care in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Methodology/Principal Findings A prospective year long, single-center, consecutive case series of individuals diagnosed with cryptococcal meningitis 190 patients were diagnosed with culture positive cryptococcal meningitis, of whom 186 were included in the study. 52/186 (28.0%) patients died within 14 days of diagnosis and 60/186 (32.3%) had died by day 28. In multivariable cox regression analysis, focal neurology (aHR 11 95%C.I. 3.08–39.3, P<0.001), diastolic blood pressure <60 mmHg (aHR 2.37 95%C.I. 1.11–5.04, P = 0.025), concurrent treatment for tuberculosis (aHR 2.11 95%C.I. 1.02–4.35, P = 0.044) and use of fluconazole monotherapy (aHR 3.69 95% C.I. 1.74–7.85, P<0.001) were associated with increased mortality at 14 and 28 days. Conclusions Even in a setting where amphotericin B is available, mortality from cryptococcal meningitis in this setting is high, particularly in the immediate period after diagnosis. This highlights the still unmet need not only for earlier diagnosis of HIV and timely access to treatment of opportunistic infections, but for better treatment strategies of cryptococcal meningitis."

https://openalex.org/W2073168505,"Knockout of heat shock protein Hsp72 was shown to promote chromosomal instability and increase radiation sensitivity of mouse fibroblasts. Here, we report that downregulation of Hsp72 in human tumor cells leads to suppression of a specific branch of the DNA damage response (DDR) that facilitates DNA repair following genotoxic insults, that is, reduced accumulation of the phosphorylated form of histone H2AX (γH2AX). This inhibition was due to decreased expression of H2AX as well as higher rate of γH2AX dephosphorylation. Formation of γH2AX and MDC1 radiation-induced foci was impaired in Hsp72-depleted cells, which in turn enhanced DNA damage, resulting in sensitization of cells to γ-radiation and doxorubicin. These effects of Hsp72 knockdown were dependent on activation of the p53/p21-signaling pathway. Overall, permanent activation of the p53/p21 signaling in Hsp72-depleted cells specifically impaired the γH2AX pathway of the DDR, enhanced DNA damage following genotoxic insults, and led to further stimulation of the p53/p21 pathway, thus creating a positive feedback loop. The resulting strong induction of p21 precipitated senescence following exposure to DNA-damaging agents, thus accounting for higher sensitivity of cells to genotoxic stresses."
https://openalex.org/W2029608953,"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is known as a “death ligand”—a member of the TNF superfamily that binds to receptors bearing death domains. As well as causing apoptosis of certain types of tumor cells, TRAIL can activate both NF-κB and JNK signalling pathways. To determine the role of TGF-β-Activated Kinase-1 (TAK1) in TRAIL signalling, we analyzed the effects of adding TRAIL to mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from TAK1 conditional knockout mice. TAK1−/− MEFs were significantly more sensitive to killing by TRAIL than wild-type MEFs, and failed to activate NF-κB or JNK. Overexpression of IKK2-EE, a constitutive activator of NF-κB, protected TAK1−/− MEFs against TRAIL killing, suggesting that TAK1 activation of NF-κB is critical for the viability of cells treated with TRAIL. Consistent with this model, TRAIL failed to induce the survival genes cIAP2 and cFlipL in the absence of TAK1, whereas activation of NF-κB by IKK2-EE restored the levels of both proteins. Moreover, ectopic expression of cFlipL, but not cIAP2, in TAK1−/− MEFs strongly inhibited TRAIL-induced cell death. These results indicate that cells that survive TRAIL treatment may do so by activation of a TAK1–NF-κB pathway that drives expression of cFlipL, and suggest that TAK1 may be a good target for overcoming TRAIL resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2031329146,"In eukaryotes, meiotic recombination is a major source of genetic diversity, but its defects in humans lead to abnormalities such as Down's, Klinefelter's and other syndromes. Human Dmc1 (hDmc1), a RecA/Rad51 homologue, is a recombinase that plays a crucial role in faithful chromosome segregation during meiosis. The initial step of homologous recombination occurs when hDmc1 forms a filament on single-stranded (ss) DNA. However the structure of this presynaptic complex filament for hDmc1 remains unknown. To compare hDmc1-ssDNA complexes to those known for the RecA/Rad51 family we have obtained electron microscopy (EM) structures of hDmc1-ssDNA nucleoprotein filaments using single particle approach. The EM maps were analysed by docking crystal structures of Dmc1, Rad51, RadA, RecA and DNA. To fully characterise hDmc1-DNA complexes we have analysed their organisation in the presence of Ca2+, Mg2+, ATP, AMP-PNP, ssDNA and dsDNA. The 3D EM structures of the hDmc1-ssDNA filaments allowed us to elucidate the principles of their internal architecture. Similar to the RecA/Rad51 family, hDmc1 forms helical filaments on ssDNA in two states: extended (active) and compressed (inactive). However, in contrast to the RecA/Rad51 family, and the recently reported structure of hDmc1-double stranded (ds) DNA nucleoprotein filaments, the extended (active) state of the hDmc1 filament formed on ssDNA has nine protomers per helical turn, instead of the conventional six, resulting in one protomer covering two nucleotides instead of three. The control reconstruction of the hDmc1-dsDNA filament revealed 6.4 protein subunits per helical turn indicating that the filament organisation varies depending on the DNA templates. Our structural analysis has also revealed that the N-terminal domain of hDmc1 accomplishes its important role in complex formation through domain swapping between adjacent protomers, thus providing a mechanistic basis for coordinated action of hDmc1 protomers during meiotic recombination."

Understanding how tumor cells invade tissues is key to developing drugs to block metastasis. In this issue, Muller et al., 2009Muller P.A.J. Caswell P.T. Doyle B. Iwanicki M.P. Tan E.H. Karim S. Lukashchuk N. Gillespie D.A. Ludwig R.L. Gosselin P. et al.Cell. 2009; (this issue)Google Scholar report that a mutant form of the tumor suppressor p53 in cancer cells boosts the endocytic recycling of the adhesion molecule integrin α5β1 and of epidermal growth factor receptor, promoting invasion and metastasis. Metastasis—the ability of cells in a primary tumor to invade other tissues and to spread throughout the body—is the underlying cause of most cancer deaths. Myriad cellular signaling pathways are known to facilitate tissue invasion and metastasis (Chiang and Massagué, 2008Chiang A.C. Massagué J. N. Engl. J. Med. 2008; 359: 2814-2823Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). Many of these pathways are highly cell type and context dependent and so may drive metastasis of only a few tumor types. Hence, pinpointing signaling pathways that facilitate the metastasis of many types of tumors would provide valuable targets for preventing the spread of many different cancers. Inactivation of the tumor suppressor protein p53 through point mutations or enhanced degradation of the protein is a trait common to the majority of human cancers. In this issue of Cell, Muller et al., 2009Muller P.A.J. Caswell P.T. Doyle B. Iwanicki M.P. Tan E.H. Karim S. Lukashchuk N. Gillespie D.A. Ludwig R.L. Gosselin P. et al.Cell. 2009; (this issue)Google Scholar show both in vitro and in vivo that expression of mutant p53 drives invasion and metastasis through increased recycling of integrins and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) back to the plasma membrane of tumor cells. They further demonstrate that the ability of mutant p53 to drive invasion correlates with its sequestration of p63, a transcription factor and p53 family member. Given that mutant p53 is frequently overexpressed in many tumors (Selivanova and Wiman, 2007Selivanova G. Wiman K.G. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 2243-2254Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), a key question that has puzzled cancer researchers is why tumors retain this disabled tumor suppressor rather than losing it entirely, as is the case with other tumor suppressors such as the retinoblastoma protein or p16. Compelling experimental evidence from mouse models suggests that mutant p53 acquires a gain of function that imbues tumor cells with increased capabilities for invasion and metastasis that are not seen in mice that have lost both p53 alleles (Brosh and Rotter, 2009Brosh R. Rotter V. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2009; 9: 701-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in many types of human tumors, overexpression of mutant p53 is associated with a poor prognosis, supporting the idea of a gain-of-function phenotype for mutant p53, rather than a loss-of-function or dominant-negative effect of wild-type p53 (Brosh and Rotter, 2009Brosh R. Rotter V. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2009; 9: 701-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). Mutant p53 perturbs the expression of multiple genes through abnormal binding to DNA or to proteins, such as the transcription factors NF-κB and E2F1 and the p53 family members p63 and p73 (Brosh and Rotter, 2009Brosh R. Rotter V. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2009; 9: 701-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). Sequestration of p63 by mutant p53 appears to play a key role in promoting invasion and metastasis through several mechanisms. Muller et al., 2009Muller P.A.J. Caswell P.T. Doyle B. Iwanicki M.P. Tan E.H. Karim S. Lukashchuk N. Gillespie D.A. Ludwig R.L. Gosselin P. et al.Cell. 2009; (this issue)Google Scholar now describe a novel twist in this mutant p53 gain-of-function story with their report of a new link between the intracellular trafficking of key molecules involved in adhesion and invasion (integrins and EGFR) and the inactivation of p63 by mutant p53. Loss of one p63 allele weakens the ability of wild-type p53 to carry out its transcriptional function and imbues tumors lacking one wild-type p53 allele (p53+/−) with metastatic properties. In contrast, in tumors overexpressing mutant p53 rather than losing expression of wild-type p53, the interaction of mutant p53 with p63 drives the metastatic phenotype (Brosh and Rotter, 2009Brosh R. Rotter V. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2009; 9: 701-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). Notably, transcriptional profiling has revealed that p63 regulates a whole axis of cell adhesion molecules, including laminin-binding integrins (α3β1, α6β1, α6β4) and a variety of integrin subunits (α5, β1), which bind to fibronectin in the extracellular matrix (Carroll et al., 2006Carroll D.K. Carroll J.S. Leon C.-O. Cheng F. Brown M. Mills A.A. Brugge J.S. Ellisenet L.W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 551-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Recent work has shown that in the presence of mutant p53, p63 and p73 drive expression of β4-integrin resulting in increased invasion capabilities and activation of Akt kinase (Bon et al., 2009Bon G. Di Carlo S.E. Folgiero V. Avetrani P. Lazzari C. D'Orazi G. Brizzi M.F. Sacchi A. Soddu S. Blandino G. et al.Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 5978-5986Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Mutant p53 may switch the p63 transcriptional program over to a tumor-promoting profile by inducing the expression of integrins and increasing their recycling in endosomes back to the cell surface. Muller and colleagues now demonstrate an absolute requirement for α5β1-integrin and EGFR in the invasion ability of tumor cells in vitro. The fact that they did not observe notable changes in the expression of integrin α5β1, EGFR, or the Rab-coupling protein (RCP, which facilitates endocytic recycling) suggests that enhanced endocytic trafficking of these factors (rather than transcriptional control of integrin expression) is the main mechanism for driving tumor invasion in this model. Muller and coworkers extend these findings and show that mutant p53 facilitates tissue invasion by tumor cells by boosting the interaction between RCP and α5β1-integrin and the endocytic recycling of α5β1 and EGFR. They demonstrate that exogenously introduced and endogenously expressed mutant p53 in several cell lines drives invasion in assays in vitro and confirm this finding in immunocompromised mice transplanted with human tumor cell xenografts. Further, in mice lacking the Apc tumor suppressor, expression of mutant p53 increases invasiveness of intestinal tumor cells by 75%. In cell culture assays, enhanced formation of the α5β1-EGFR-RCP complex augments the random motility of tumor cells and their ability to invade fibronectin-containing matrices and correlates with increased phosphorylation of Akt kinase (Figure 1). Consistent with this, the authors demonstrate a correlation between mutant p53 expression and Akt phosphorylation in human tumor samples. The endocytic trafficking of integrins back to the plasma membrane regulates many adhesion-dependent processes. These include cell motility, cytokinesis, and the interaction between integrins and growth factor receptors that controls the signaling pathways that induce tumor cell proliferation and invasion (Caswell et al., 2009Caswell P.T. Vadrevu S. Norman J.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 843-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Importantly, trafficking of different integrin heterodimers is highly interconnected and regulates the rate of recycling of other receptors to the plasma membrane, including EGFR and vascular epidermal growth factor receptor (VEGFR). In fibroblasts, cancer cells, and endothelial cells, the recognition of ligand by ανβ3-integrin and its rapid endocytic recycling suppresses formation and recycling of a complex comprising RCP, α5β1-integrin, and EGFR or VEGFR2 (Caswell et al., 2009Caswell P.T. Vadrevu S. Norman J.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 843-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Interestingly, small-molecule inhibitors designed to block ανβ3-integrin during blood vessel formation (angiogenesis) also seem to induce tumor metastasis by boosting the recycling of the α5β1-EGFR-(or VEGFR2)-RCP complex (Caswell et al., 2009Caswell P.T. Vadrevu S. Norman J.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 843-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Recent in vitro and in vivo data challenge the view that ανβ3-integrin is a tumor promoter and instead suggest a potential inhibitory role for ανβ3-integrin in tumor metastasis. Overexpression of ανβ3-integrin in ovarian tumor cells result in a decrease in tissue invasion in vitro, and patients with ovarian carcinoma whose tumors overexpress β3-integrin have a significantly better prognosis (Kaur et al., 2009Kaur S. Kenny H.A. Jagadeeswaran S. Zillhardt M.R. Montag A.G. Kistner E. Yamada S.D. Mitra A.K. Lengyel E. Am. J. Pathol. 2009; 175: 2184-2196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These data underscore the clinical relevance of work describing ανβ3-integrin as a major inhibitor of the recycling of the α5β1-EGFR-RCP complex and hence of tumor metastasis. From a therapeutic viewpoint, the new work by Muller et al. together with previous reports raise the possibility that tumors expressing mutant p53 may be eradicated efficiently by blocking the proinvasion gain-of-function effects of mutant p53. This could be achieved either by molecules directly disrupting the interaction of mutant p53 with p63 or by restoring mutant p53 to its wild-type conformation (Selivanova and Wiman, 2007Selivanova G. Wiman K.G. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 2243-2254Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Yet it is still unclear how increased endocytic recycling of integrins is achieved. Does mutant p53 block p63 transactivation or induce abnormal activity of p63? Which targets of p63 directly regulate the recycling of integrins? Further experiments with different in vitro assays of tumor cells and their interactions with extracellular matrix molecules will hopefully define the critical integrin-mediated pathways that are activated in cells harboring p53 point mutations. Mutant p53 Drives Invasion by Promoting Integrin RecyclingMuller et al.CellDecember 24, 2009In Briefp53 is a tumor suppressor protein whose function is frequently lost in cancers through missense mutations within the Tp53 gene. This results in the expression of point-mutated p53 proteins that have both lost wild-type tumor suppressor activity and show gain of functions that contribute to transformation and metastasis. Here, we show that mutant p53 expression can promote invasion, loss of directionality of migration, and metastatic behavior. These activities of p53 reflect enhanced integrin and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) trafficking, which depends on Rab-coupling protein (RCP) and results in constitutive activation of EGFR/integrin signaling.

https://openalex.org/W2003511408,"Background In parts of India, Chandipura Virus (CHPV) has emerged as an encephalitis causing pathogen in both epidemic and sporadic forms. This pediatric disease follows rapid course leading to 55–75% mortality. In the absence of specific treatment, effectiveness of RNA interference (RNAi) was evaluated. Methods and Findings Efficacy of synthetic short interfering RNA (siRNA) or short hairpin RNA (shRNA) in protecting mice from CHPV infection was assessed. The target genes were P and M genes primarily because important role of the former in viral replication and lethal nature of the latter. Real time one step RT-PCR and plaque assay were used for the assessment of gene silencing. Using pAcGFP1N1-CHPV-P, we showed that P-2 siRNA was most efficient in reducing the expression of P gene in-vitro. Both quantitative assays documented 2logs reduction in the virus titer when P-2, M-5 or M-6 siRNAs were transfected 2hr post infection (PI). Use of these siRNAs in combination did not result in enhanced efficiency. P-2 siRNA was found to tolerate four mismatches in the center. As compared to five different shRNAs, P-2 siRNA was most effective in inhibiting CHPV replication. An extended survival was noted when mice infected intracranially with 100 LD50 CHPV were treated with cationic lipid complexed 5 µg P-2 siRNA simultaneously. Infection with 10LD50 and treatment with two doses of siRNA first, simultaneously and second 24 hr PI, resulted in 70% survival. Surviving mice showed 4logs less CHPV titers in brain without histopathological changes or antibody response. Gene expression profiles of P-2 siRNA treated mice showed no interferon response. First dose of siRNA at 2hr or 4hr PI with second dose at 24hr resulted in 40% and 20% survival respectively suggesting potential application in therapy. Conclusions The results highlight therapeutic potential of siRNA in treating rapid and fatal Chandipura encephalitis."
https://openalex.org/W1982338273,"The development of species priorities for conservation at local or regional scales (for example, within a state or province) poses an interesting paradox. One the one hand, locally or regionally-derived species priorities may lead to greater interest in and resources directed to biodiversity conservation by local or regional institutions. On the other hand, locally or regionally-derived species priorities could overlook national or global priorities. We assessed U.S. state government agency endangered-threatened bird lists to determine the comparative representation of species of global versus local conservation significance on them. State lists tended to be represented primarily by species of low global risk-low global responsibility (range: 15-100%; mean 51%) and high global risk-high global responsibility (range: 0-73%; mean 35%). In 25 states, more than half of the species on the state lists were in the low global risk-low global responsibility category. Most U.S. state agency lists represent a combined strategy of highlighting species of both local and global conservation significance. Even with this combined local-global strategy, most state lists were predominated by species that represent local but not global conservation significance. Such a strategy could have profound negative consequences for many species that are not formally recognized under national endangered species protections but that are also left off of state-level endangered species lists."

As the Northern hemisphere winter flu season kicks off, Laura Vargas-Parada reports on the measures that Mexico is taking to combat the H1N1 pandemic. In April this year, a new influenza virus of swine origin emerged in Mexico and spread rapidly around the world. As the Northern hemisphere winter flu season kicks off, Laura Vargas-Parada reports on the measures that Mexico is taking to combat the H1N1 pandemic. Although Mexico has been actively engaged in establishing a health emergency response network for a decade, the emergence of the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 flu virus this Spring put the network under intense pressure and prompted evaluation of omissions and unexpected outcomes. One major flaw in the Preparedness and Response Plan was that “all possible scenarios considered that the potential risk would arrive from abroad, most likely from Asia, giving us time to react to the emergency. We never expected the epidemic to start here,” explains Mexico's health minister José Angel Córdova. “In a matter of hours important decisions had to be taken with the scarce information we had at hand,” he adds. Ignacio Villaseñor, undersecretary of health for Mexico City's local government, emphasizes that “at that moment, what we needed to achieve was that those that were healthy not to get sick, those that were sick not to develop severe disease, and those who developed severe disease not to die.” Strict measures to prevent the spread of the H1N1 virus were implemented. “This was a new virus; no one knew how virulent it was or its capacity for transmission so we were extremely cautious. Putting it into perspective, now we know the disease is not as severe as it was expected…but not at that time,” says Córdova. Mexico was the only country during the emergence of the H1N1 pandemic to establish a broad-based strategy for school closures and bans on public gatherings; in Mexico City, the world's third largest metropolis, all nonessential activities were shut down. It is estimated that the pandemic cost Mexico ∼$4 billion dollars (0.4% of its GDP). One of the major questions raised during the Spring pandemic was the death toll observed in Mexico and not elsewhere. “A retrospective analysis of the epidemiological data has shown that one main contributing factor for the death of patients was the delayed admission and delayed initiation of antiviral treatment,” explains Córdova. In Mexico, most people who get the flu never go to a doctor. Even worse, it is common for people to self-diagnose and to treat themselves with homemade remedies or, as few drugs require a prescription, they simply buy them at the drugstore. “With a massive media campaign, people are now looking for medical attention at the onset of symptoms and the death rate has diminished to be currently similar to what is reported globally. Before April 23 people took up to nine days to see a doctor, now the average is a day and a half,” says Córdova. As of December 2 this year, there have been 66,070 confirmed cases of pandemic H1N1 (2009) flu and 671 deaths in Mexico (for comparison, according to the National System on Health Information, there were 14,575 deaths from acute respiratory infections in 2007). Much has been learned from the early days of the H1N1 (2009) pandemic and many changes have been implemented in time for this winter's flu season. So far this year, the Mexican government has invested ∼$330 million to buy general supplies, antivirals, vaccines, laboratory equipment, mechanical ventilators, and monitors for acute care. The purchase of H1N1 2009 vaccine alone is expected to cost ∼$200 million. In the US, 250 million doses of swine flu vaccine have been ordered at a cost of $1.5 billion and the US Congress has set aside $7.65 billion to fight pandemic flu. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as of December 4 there were 73 million doses of H1N1 vaccine available in the US. Like many other countries, Mexico has been struggling to obtain a sufficient supply of H1N1 flu vaccine. A recent agreement with the French pharma company Sanofi-Aventis enabled Mexico to obtain 865,000 doses of Panenza vaccine last month (215,000 doses from France and 650,000 doses from the US). The next batch “will arrive between December and March to complete a total of 30 million,” says Alejandro Macías, special commissioner of the Federal Government for human influenza and assistant director at the National Institute of Medical Sciences and Nutrition. Sanofi-Aventis is supplying 20 million doses, and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) is providing an additional 10 million doses of its H1N1 pandemic vaccine with adjuvant (Arepanrix) manufactured in Canada. “As the number of vaccines is limited, there will be a program to prioritize health-care workers, pregnant women, children from six months to three years old, as well as individuals at risk of severe disease, such as people with chronic underlying illnesses,” says Macías. As for seasonal influenza vaccination, since October 5, 20 million doses have been given to health-care workers, children, the elderly, and those over 50 with conditions like asthma, diabetes, or obesity. “We expect to complete seasonal vaccination by December,” adds Macías. Seasonal influenza vaccination was introduced in Mexico as part of the annual national vaccination campaign in 2004. To assure the efficient allocation of both vaccines and antivirals, “we have implemented a central logistics and delivery system,” explains Córdova. Both vaccines and antivirals are being distributed by Biologicals and Reactives of Mexico (BIRMEX), “which has a very well established network,” says Macías. (BIRMEX is a state-owned company that produces, distributes, and imports vaccines, heterologous sera, and clinical diagnostic products). Many have complained that the shortage of H1N1 flu vaccine is a result of the monopoly imposed by the countries where the vaccine is produced. “For decades, Mexico produced all the vaccines that were applied in the country. However, very bad political decisions reduced our capability to mainly commercialize and distribute the vaccines and products others produce,” explains infectious diseases expert Samuel Ponce de León, a former medical director for Bristol-Myers Squibb in Mexico and current director of BIRMEX. “At the end of 2007, BIRMEX acquired a production plant with the aim of regaining capability to produce vaccines and established an agreement with Sanofi-Aventis for the technological transfer and construction of a plant for producing seasonal influenza vaccine.” With an investment of $250 million, the plant, located in the State of Mexico, will initiate security and stability tests in 2011 and is expected to start producing around 25 million doses of vaccine by 2012. Ponce de León adds, “it has been a great mistake not to have given priority to investment in the development of science and technology” as it is clearly becoming a matter of national security. The winter flu season in Mexico is expected to peak next month, and an agreement has been reached that public health hospitals will reserve at least 12% of their beds for pandemic flu patients. “To expand hospital capacity, parking lots and classrooms will be equipped to receive the patients, non-essential activities like elective surgeries will be suspended, and those patients that can be taken care of at home will be discharged,” says Córdova. In Mexico City, the local government has designated two separate hospitals for the management of adults and children with pandemic flu. The remaining 26 local hospitals and 220 outpatient clinics will remain open during evenings and weekends to assist people seeking medical attention. As people are being advised to consult a physician at the first signs of flu symptoms like fever and cough, triage will be important for distributing scarce resources in a rational manner. “We have found that … caravanas de la salud are very useful,” says Córdova. Launched in 2007, caravanas de la salud is a nationwide system of mobile healthcare (medical and dental) clinics operated by physicians and nurses that provide regular primary care to low-income individuals living in remote areas throughout the country. “During the early outbreak they gave thousands of medical consults, resolving many of the enquiries and reducing the number of people visiting the hospitals,” says Córdova. A key measure to counter the flu season this winter is a health promotion and prevention program. “We need to create a culture of prevention,” says Esther Orozco, general director of the Institute of Science and Technology of Mexico City. Córdova notes that “a major strategy in our program for the winter season is the training of personnel. Different workshops have been put in place at three major levels: physicians and nurses (to standardize diagnosis and treatment), hospital staff members (to respond to the need for adequate hospital infrastructure), and state health ministers.” Guides, educational material, and handbooks used in the workshops as well as information for the general public are available online (http://www.promocion.salud.gob.mx/dgps/interior1/influenza_estacional.html). Despite all of these efforts, Mexico still lags behind other countries in investing in public health. In 2007, for example, Mexico invested 5.9% of its GDP on health, compared with an average of 9.1% for members of OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development) and 16% for the US (http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?datasetcode=SNA_TABLE1). The public health expenditure per capita for the same year was $372 in Mexico compared with $3310 in the US. A major problem with the H1N1 pandemic flu outbreak in April was meeting the demand for rapid diagnosis. At that time, only the Institute of Epidemiological Diagnosis and Reference (InDRE) in Mexico City (Mexico's National Public Health Laboratory) had the facilities to implement the CDC's protocol for using RT-PCR to detect the influenza A (H1N1) 2009 virus strain. Major investments were made after the outbreak to upgrade Mexico's diagnostic laboratory network. Currently, 27 state public health laboratories (out of 31), 1 laboratory in the Mexican Institute for Social Security network, and 3 (out of 12) of the National Institutes of Health in Mexico City are now equipped to use RT-PCR to detect the H1N1 virus. This month, Mexico City expects to open its own fully equipped state public health laboratory at the University of Mexico City. For seasonal influenza, “28 state laboratories have the capability to determine if the samples sent by sentinel surveillance clinics are influenza A or B by means of immunofluorescence assays,” says InDRE deputy director Celia Alpuche-Aranda. “All positive samples for influenza, and 10% of the negative ones are then sent for confirmation to InDRE. If positivity is confirmed then subtyping (H1, H3, and H5) is done and a viral isolate obtained. For subtyping, we use the hemagglutination-inhibition test and RT-PCR. Samples are sent to CDC, our collaborative center in the Flu-Net network,” she says. “Surveillance for [pandemic (H1N1) virus] mutations is done by sequencing the neuraminidase gene. Up to now, 106 different clinical specimens collected from different dates and locations have been analyzed and all have been shown to be susceptible to neuraminidase inhibitors,” adds Alpuche-Aranda. “Selected virus isolates mainly from severe hospitalized cases and deaths will be fully sequenced using CDC's overlapping forward and reverse primers. At this moment we are standardizing the technique,” she says. With most of the laboratory work focusing on diagnosis, there has been little time for monitoring emerging mutations and viral reassortants. One way to solve this limitation “would be to bring in academic labs outside of the government testing system, but sharing of clinical materials and trust is low,” says Susana López Charretón, a virologist from the Institute of Biotechnology at the National University of Mexico (UNAM). “We can provide state-of-the art technology and human resources to help them [but] there was no response, no sign of interest. We could have collaborated in the analysis of a national seroepidemiology survey to know how many people have been already exposed to the virus,” she says. Another problem that surfaced with the outbreak was the lack of trained personnel to respond to an emergency of this type. “We are still a very small scientific community and are in desperate need of more virologists” says López Charretón. The perception of a lack of collaboration between clinical and other researchers, and between government laboratories and academia across the country, is a major concern. “During this epidemic, policy makers failed to recognize what public universities had to offer: the power of a well-established scientific community that was ready to help in harnessing the best available knowledge to solve the country's problems,” says Antonio Lazcano, an evolutionary biologist at UNAM. “We were severely criticized for sending samples of the suspected cases to the Public Health Agency of Canada and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,” says Alpuche-Aranda. “In Mexico, we have first level research groups, but none of them had experience, neither the primers nor the probes, to isolate unknown pathogens. We were in a rush to sort out what was going on. Besides, the World Health Organization requires a set of standards to safely handle and work with new pathogens,” she explains. Fátima Fernández Christlieb, a sociologist at UNAM, points out that “the new influenza virus highlighted a large list of shortages, among them, the lack of coordination within the academic community and the absence of links between academia and those who make the decisions that affect the country.” Córdova concedes: “We worked together. Still, we need to work out a better strategy for collaborating with academia.” Another issue of concern is that although Mexican researchers compiled valuable information during the initial H1N1 influenza outbreak, very few articles have been published in peer-reviewed journals. Villaseñor explains, “[at that time] we were overloaded with surveillance and field work and did not have enough staff.” A team led by Lazcano chose to publish a preliminary evolutionary analysis of the virus on their own blog page “with the goal of reaching a much broader audience,” Lazcano explains. For Gustavo Cruz Pacheco, at UNAM's Institute of Applied Mathematics, who studied the dynamics of the outbreak when control measures were implemented, the difficulty was to cross disciplines and publish in biology journals. As the winter flu season proceeds, Mexico continues to look for ways to bolster public health programs and to make better use of its scientists and research facilities. As Córdova points out, “there will always be problems. And the best way to face them is not by hiding them, but to bring them forward, ask for all the support needed, and make all decisions based upon the best available scientific data.” Carlos Arias, director of the Biotechnology Institute at UNAM, concurs: “The only way to make decisions and establish public policies is through the knowledge and evidence that comes from scientific research.” From the point of view of policy implementation, Orozco says, “most Mexican politicians are scientifically illiterate and do not have a vision about the importance of science. That is why, although we can say we have science, that won't be enough while decision-makers do not recognize the power of scientific research in making policies on the basis of evidence. As a country we need to know why we want science, which are the plans, the projects, the route, the aims that we want to achieve by means of science and technology.”"
https://openalex.org/W2001141658,"Antisense oligonucleotides targeting microRNAs or their mRNA targets prove to be powerful tools for molecular biology research and may eventually emerge as new therapeutic agents. Synthetic oligonucleotides are often contaminated with highly homologous failure sequences. Synthesis of a certain oligonucleotide is difficult to scale up because it requires expensive equipment, hazardous chemicals and a tedious purification process. Here we report a novel thermocyclic reaction, polymerase-endonuclease amplification reaction (PEAR), for the amplification of oligonucleotides. A target oligonucleotide and a tandem repeated antisense probe are subjected to repeated cycles of denaturing, annealing, elongation and cleaving, in which thermostable DNA polymerase elongation and strand slipping generate duplex tandem repeats, and thermostable endonuclease (PspGI) cleavage releases monomeric duplex oligonucleotides. Each round of PEAR achieves over 100-fold amplification. The product can be used in one more round of PEAR directly, and the process can be further repeated. In addition to avoiding dangerous materials and improved product purity, this reaction is easy to scale up and amenable to full automation. PEAR has the potential to be a useful tool for large-scale production of antisense oligonucleotide drugs."
https://openalex.org/W1969525066,"When a moving stimulus and a briefly flashed static stimulus are physically aligned in space the static stimulus is perceived as lagging behind the moving stimulus. This vastly replicated phenomenon is known as the Flash-Lag Effect (FLE). For the first time we employed biological motion as the moving stimulus, which is important for two reasons. Firstly, biological motion is processed by visual as well as somatosensory brain areas, which makes it a prime candidate for elucidating the interplay between the two systems with respect to the FLE. Secondly, discussions about the mechanisms of the FLE tend to recur to evolutionary arguments, while most studies employ highly artificial stimuli with constant velocities.Since biological motion is ecologically valid it follows complex patterns with changing velocity. We therefore compared biological to symbolic motion with the same acceleration profile. Our results with 16 observers revealed a qualitatively different pattern for biological compared to symbolic motion and this pattern was predicted by the characteristics of motor resonance: The amount of anticipatory processing of perceived actions based on the induced perspective and agency modulated the FLE.Our study provides first evidence for an FLE with non-linear motion in general and with biological motion in particular. Our results suggest that predictive coding within the sensorimotor system alone cannot explain the FLE. Our findings are compatible with visual prediction (Nijhawan, 2008) which assumes that extrapolated motion representations within the visual system generate the FLE. These representations are modulated by sudden visual input (e.g. offset signals) or by input from other systems (e.g. sensorimotor) that can boost or attenuate overshooting representations in accordance with biased neural competition (Desimone & Duncan, 1995)."
https://openalex.org/W2050374921,"Arfs and Arf GTPase-activating proteins (ArfGAPs) are regulators of membrane trafficking and actin dynamics in mammalian cells. In this study, we identified a primordial Arf, ArfA, and two ArfGAPs (ACAP-A/B) containing BAR, PH, ArfGAP and Ankyrin repeat domains in the eukaryote Dictyostelium discoideum. In vitro, ArfA has similar nucleotide binding properties as mammalian Arfs and, with GTP bound, is a substrate for ACAP-A and B. We also investigated the physiological functions of ACAP-A/B by characterizing cells lacking both ACAP-A and B. Although ACAP-A/B knockout cells showed no defects in cell growth, migration or chemotaxis, they exhibited abnormal actin protrusions and approximately 50% reduction in spore yield. We conclude that while ACAP-A/B have a conserved biochemical mechanism and effect on actin organization, their role in migration is not conserved. The absence of an effect on Dictyostelium migration may be due to a specific requirement for ACAPs in mesenchymal migration, which is observed in epithelial cancer cells where most studies of mammalian ArfGAPs were performed."

https://openalex.org/W1994321738,"Far-reaching government reforms are being implemented to overhaul France's national research organizations in the life and health sciences, but researchers are anxious about what lies ahead. Karen Dente reports. Far-reaching government reforms are being implemented to overhaul France's national research organizations in the life and health sciences, but researchers are anxious about what lies ahead. Karen Dente reports. The ongoing efforts by the French government to revamp its national research organizations and to redefine a national strategy for scientific innovation have many French researchers concerned. “There is an immense revolt in the scientific research community. The government does not understand our institutions, and they are doing things that do not work,” says Isabelle Saint-Jean, President of the lobby group Let's Save Research (Sauvons La Recherche), founded in 2004 during the first round of government cuts to science. “I don't think that scientists can be completely independent and should be living in an ivory tower. There is always political pressure, but I guess the way that the reforms are being conducted is not useful and are giving many researchers the impression that they are taking everything away at once,” says Mathieu Beraneck, a neurobiology postdoc at the Université Paris-Descartes. Professors, postdocs, and students across France took to the streets in protest earlier this year, after President Nicolas Sarkozy announced his intention to dismantle CNRS (Centre Nationale de la Recherche Scientifique), a bastion of basic research, and remove its decision-making capabilities. And in April this year, the French government announced plans to unite disparate research institutes into a new National Alliance for Life and Health Sciences (Alliance Nationale pour les Sciences de la Vie et de la Santé). Compounding these sweeping changes is an ongoing reorganization of the university system that aims to make universities more autonomous with university presidents now allowed to decide how much time scientists can spend on research versus teaching. The beleaguered CNRS, which underwent restructuring last year into separate departments, is now to be further separated into a loose consortium of distinct institutes. “They are keeping the name CNRS but will have transformed it into something that has nothing to do with it,” says Alain Trautmann, an immunologist at the Institut Cochin and founder and former spokesperson of Let's Save Research. “A few years ago, the most important person was not the minister of research, but the director of CNRS. This is now becoming a structure that is no longer ruled by scientists. They want everything decided at the level of the ministry,” says Trautmann. “There are a few researchers who were consulted on an informal basis within networks that know the minister. This has all been very opaque and was not done in an open way with a scientific board where people know who is advising and what has been said,” says Trautmann. He and others have asked the current director of CNRS, Catherine Bréchignac, to resign claiming that she is not protecting the best interests of the organization. “She basically does what the government asks her to do. She knows she has been put there to do certain politics and she knows that the two previous people were fired before the end of the contracts over disagreement with the government, so Catherine Bréchignac is carefully avoiding anything that would go against the will of the government,” says Trautmann. But Bréchignac claims that the CNRS would not be weakened by this reorganization. “We are simply repositioning an institute. We are changing structures and putting in place research networks to better respond to the global research challenges and to have a more clear strategy to decide in which direction we want to go,” she told Cell in an interview. The funds for research distributed by CNRS, and another major research organization INSERM (which supports biomedical research and is the French equivalent of the US National Institutes of Health), have decreased markedly since the launch of a new grant funding agency called ANR (Agence Nationale de la Recherche). ANR has been widely criticized by scientists for reducing the stature of CNRS and INSERM. ANR now hands out much of the funding that used to be distributed by CNRS and INSERM and supports about half of all life sciences research. According to the latest figures, ANR has funded 4500 research projects with 3 billion euros over 5 years. In contrast to CNRS and INSERM, ANR does not have elected scientists on its governing board. “ANR distributes hundreds of millions of euro and has no consulting scientific board. That is surreal,” says Pierre Netter, a professor of genetics at the Université Pierre et Marie Curie in Paris. ANR has instigated a new system, pilotage de recherche (call for proposals), in which the majority of submitted grants (∼70%–75%) are allocated to research proposals that are in line with particular research fields, such as cancer or neurodegenerative disease. Only 25% of funding is available for so-called white programs (program blanc), which allow researchers to submit grants on any research topic, with funds awarded based on excellence rather than subject area. This disparity is perceived by researchers as too directed, threatening the independence of researchers used to a more bottom-up approach in which they initiate and develop their own research goals. Echoing the sentiment of many French scientists, Saint-Jean calls the recent push on behalf of the government to boost applied research through ANR-directed funding of specific topics “a bad idea.” “Some extremely innovative research comes out of places where no one suspects it will come from. You just don't know where the next breakthrough will emerge,” she says. “Knowledge is something which you can value for itself. They don't see that. According to the current political administration, research is something that must produce innovation, which must have some application, only that.” And Netter worries that advances in basic research with less direct application will fall behind. “All the new measures that are being put in place to distribute grants are favoring useful research, as if there were such a thing as useful and not useful research,” he says. “Richard Nixon had a set plan for finding a cure for cancer which resulted in nothing interesting. This was a mistake. There is no system that can predefine how breakthroughs will occur in science, especially in fundamental research.” Jean-Francois Bach, an immunologist and the permanent secretary of the Académie de Sciences, says “Funding should be more open. We at the academy feel that the excellence of a project should be the only criterion and that most funding should be given to so-called white schemes that are based on excellence independently of the topic.” Beraneck agrees: “We don't know what is going to happen tomorrow. Every three months or so there is a new reform. Sometimes it is like every day,” he says. “We are not sure that the CNRS is going to exist, and we are not sure we can get a grant from ANR. They make the decisions, they make the call for proposals, and you have to force research into a direction which falls into the mainstream projects they provide funding for.” The government is the main employer of scientists in France, which does not have a tradition of private companies financing research. Saint-Jean believes that the French government's current strategy of reorganizing publicly funded research toward more applied research is the wrong approach and that it should focus, rather, on increasing incentives for corporations to finance research and employ scientists. “Businesses are not financing research sufficiently in France and I don't see that they will be doing that now in a time of crisis,” she says. “For the biomedical sector that might not pose any problems, but for all other areas it will.” Valérie Pécresse, the Minister for Higher Education and Research, who is responsible for making decisions and implementation of reforms, agrees to the validity of the objections voiced by the scientific community and said in a written statement to Cell that “the ANR must make room for more investigator-driven projects.” In what Pécresse referred to as “a show of faith towards the entire community,” she noted that she had already increased the share of funding for white program proposals, and that she “would like the share of these projects to reach 50% of the funding allocation.” In response to the concerns of the scientific community, Pécresse held a press conference in October to announce that white programs would indeed be increased to constitute 50% of the funds allocated by ANR starting in 2010. The increasing prominence of ANR and diminishing influence of CNRS and INSERM in funding research is not the only concern. The newly formed National Alliance for Life and Health Sciences has been viewed with skepticism by many in the scientific community. The Alliance—combining eight institutes including CNRS, INSERM, the Institut Pasteur, and several agricultural, nutritional, and statistical institutes—was formed in response to a report by Elias Zerhouni, former director of the US National Institutes of Health. Zerhouni was invited by the French government to make recommendations about the reorganization of its disparate biomedical institutions. Pécresse said in a written statement that the Alliance's objective is to “form a very tight operational coordination for the implementation of measures and to achieve improved harmonization and simplification of procedures.” Whether this new Alliance will truly remove some of the complexity of the current system remains to be seen. “Most of us agree that there are too many layers of administration, and most of us are convinced that this new Alliance is not going to improve research, but is just adding another layer of complexity,” says Claire Legay, a neurobiologist at the Université Paris-Descartes, whose lab is funded by INSERM. “The level of complexity is really too high and the funding is very low. We don't know who is going to fund what,” she says. “In the past, we used to have more time to do research, because we had money coming from the government more easily and didn't have to stress all the time to find money through organizations like ANR.” French biologists also are concerned that the new Alliance will lead to biology becoming cut off from other disciplines such as chemistry and physics, weakening cross-disciplinary research and slowing innovation. Another component of the government's overhaul of the French research landscape has been to grant universities more autonomy, making them more like private organizations with less dependence on public financing and allowing them to shoulder more responsibility for the research conducted in their labs. “The strategic path we have carved for the past two years was designed, first and foremost, to provide universities with the autonomy they needed to become major actors in research,” said Pécresse in a written statement. Twenty of the 81 public universities in France became autonomous on January 1st this year, and the next wave of 20 universities are expected to become autonomous on January 1st, 2010. “In contrast to a US university, the president of a French university has two roles, and that is not good,” explains Netter. “There is the scientific academic part, and then the administrative and financial. In the US, these are separate roles. In France, both are performed by the president, giving him too much power,” he says. Opponents of this reform, such as Trautmann, fear that the infrastructure will not be in place for universities to handle their newly added responsibilities. “More than 10,000 researchers from CNRS will suddenly have to be [overseen], paid, administered by the universities and without the corresponding staff this would be a real mess. It could be too much at once,” he says. But changes to the antiquated university research system are generally deemed as necessary by the scientific research community. “Globally speaking I think the reform is needed. The system is not good enough. It is not competitive enough. The lack of competition makes the job less attractive. It is also not well considered in France and not well paid,” says Beraneck. Universities, together with CNRS and INSERM, have traditionally formed the so-called “unités mixtes de recherche” (UMR), of which there are 400 across France. UMR labs are run partly by the universities and partly by CNRS and INSERM. The quality of research in UMR centers is considered better than that in university labs. Pécresse calls the UMR labs “the locus for cooperation” and has stated that the ministry “would now like to move towards a resolute simplification of their management,” as they are currently overseen by four different bodies with different funding and evaluation systems. Some scientists fear that with all of the reforms underway the balance of power will shift away from these research units. “Most of the best research in France emerges from these labs,” says Saint-Jean, who remains skeptical that the new balance of power will be held equally by the universities and ANR. She believes that if CNRS and INSERM do eventually disappear, it would be to the advantage of ANR but not the universities and would result in a weakening of the quality of research emerging from UMR labs. Jean-Francois Bach would like to see more cohesion between all of the institutes to improve communication between ANR, CNRS, and INSERM. “They don't talk to each other enough,” he says. This year, 900 postdoc positions have been lost in universities and CNRS- and INSERM-funded research institutes, with a dramatic impact on young researchers and their future. The number of new permanent positions offered to young researchers at CNRS and INSERM institutes has decreased by 25% this year, according to statistics released by the Ministry of Higher Education and Research, and there will be 30% fewer PhD degrees awarded by 2017. “There are more people hoping that they will get permanent positions, but they know that there will be fewer. This is not good for the spirit in which they work. Some young people just quit after they get their PhD,” says Legay. “You can discuss the fact that we don't want to give permanent positions before scientists have acquired a certain maturity, which would be okay if we actually had the opportunities for postdocs,” she says. But a lack of permanent positions is not the only problem. “In France, you can only get one or two-year contracts. Mine is one year and can be prolonged by another year. It is funded through the space agency CNES,” says Beraneck. “But it's very difficult to start a collaboration this way. There is no long-term perspective.” Lab directors usually employ postdocs on 18 month short-term contracts paid with general lab funds. According to French labor law, these contracts cannot be renewed, resulting in a constant turnover of postdocs.
