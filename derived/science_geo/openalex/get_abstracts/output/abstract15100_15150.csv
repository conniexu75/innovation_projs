https://openalex.org/W2053743905,"The importance of suckling experience for later feeding in the rat was tested by means of an isolate rearing technique that eliminated oral feeding. Pups reared in the nearly complete absence of suckling and feeding ate and drank at weaning and then grew normally. Furthermore, the characteristics of apparently normal ingestion and growth make the artificially reared rat a useful preparation for other developmental investigations."

https://openalex.org/W1970321541,"A rod monochromat can preserve visual information in iconic memory even when the initial stimulus is invisible to the subject. Since the initial invisibility is due to rod saturation, it can be shown that all the information must have been stored inside the photoreceptors. Because the spectral sensitivity for producing icons in normal subjects is that of the rods, the conclusion is that in normal subjects, under ordinary viewing conditions, the photoreceptors are the primary store for iconic memory."

The transplanted cells were proven to be lymphocytes by immunological methods. The origin of the tadpoles that developed after lymphocyte nuclei injections was ascertained by a karyotypic marker."

https://openalex.org/W1990367928,"UNTIL a recent survey, based on the two major museum collections of Australia1, the Australian Drosophila fauna was poorly known and few endemic species had been described. This survey covered 81 species including 40 described as new. The world total of Drosophila species is known to exceed 1,250 (ref. 2); the Australian fauna thus represents about 6% of this total. By comparison with the world Drosophila fauna, the Australian total contains a disproportionately large number of species (45 out of 81) in the subgenus Scaptodrosophila, most of them endemic although a few are also known from neighbouring South-east Asian and/or Pacific regions. The Australian Drosophila fauna is therefore unique in that nowhere else have members of the subgenus Scaptodrosophila so dominated the Drosophila fauna of a large region."

Since the apparently unsuccessful attempts to resolve Fe(oxalate)3− at −30 °C on starch1, only room temperature experiments have been reported (for example, refs 2–4)."
