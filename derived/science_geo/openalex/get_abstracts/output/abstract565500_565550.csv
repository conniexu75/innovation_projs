Modifying CO 2 , as plants and microbes do, is more chemically complex. Asadi et al. report that fashioning WSe 2 and related electrochemical catalysts into nanometer-scale flakes greatly improves their activity for the reduction of CO 2 to CO. An ionic liquid reaction medium further enhances efficiency. An artificial leaf with WSe 2 reduced CO 2 on one side while a cobalt catalyst oxidized water on the other side.

Creating light beams with the desired amount of optical angular momentum, or twist, has usually been achieved with bulk optic devices. Miao et al. demonstrate a possible route for an integrated optics approach in which a twisted-light source with a controlled amount of optical angular momentum is generated internally to the designed device structure. These microlasers could find application in telecommunication and information technologies to increase the rate of information transmission. Science , this issue p. 464"

Using techniques that they developed for sequencing single nuclei and labeling proliferating cells in vivo, Habib et al. performed RNA sequencing of 1402 single nuclei from the adult mouse hippocampus. Combining this approach with a clustering algorithm for single-cell and -nucleus RNA sequencing data delineated specific cell types during cell differentiation and development. By providing polyadenylated RNA from nuclei alone, as opposed to cytoplasmic RNA, these methods open the application of single-cell transcriptomics to tissues in which individual cells are difficult to isolate.

https://openalex.org/W2494908995,"Tissue engineered vascular grafts (TEVGs) have the potential to overcome the issues faced by existing small diameter prosthetic grafts by providing a biodegradable scaffold where the patient’s own cells can engraft and form functional neotissue. However, applying classical approaches to create arterial TEVGs using slow degrading materials with supraphysiological mechanical properties, typically results in limited host cell infiltration, poor remodeling, stenosis, and calcification. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of novel small diameter arterial TEVGs created using fast degrading material. A 1.0mm and 5.0mm diameter TEVGs were fabricated with electrospun polycaprolactone (PCL) and chitosan (CS) blend nanofibers. The 1.0mm TEVGs were implanted in mice (n = 3) as an unseeded infrarenal abdominal aorta interposition conduit., The 5.0mm TEVGs were implanted in sheep (n = 6) as an unseeded carotid artery (CA) interposition conduit. Mice were followed with ultrasound and sacrificed at 6 months. All 1.0mm TEVGs remained patent without evidence of thrombosis or aneurysm formation. Based on small animal outcomes, sheep were followed with ultrasound and sacrificed at 6 months for histological and mechanical analysis. There was no aneurysm formation or calcification in the TEVGs. 4 out of 6 grafts (67%) were patent. After 6 months in vivo, 9.1 ± 5.4% remained of the original scaffold. Histological analysis of patent grafts demonstrated deposition of extracellular matrix constituents including elastin and collagen production, as well as endothelialization and organized contractile smooth muscle cells, similar to that of native CA. The mechanical properties of TEVGs were comparable to native CA. There was a significant positive correlation between TEVG wall thickness and CD68+ macrophage infiltration into the scaffold (R2 = 0.95, p = 0.001). The fast degradation of CS in our novel TEVG promoted excellent cellular infiltration and neotissue formation without calcification or aneurysm. Modulating host macrophage infiltration into the scaffold is a key to reducing excessive neotissue formation and stenosis."

Oddly, the common tomato stands tall when under attack. Hegenauer et al. have leveraged that difference to identify part of the molecular defense system that protects tomato plants (see the Perspective by Ntoukakis and Gimenez-Ibanez). In a process analogous to defenses mounted against microbial infection, the host plant perceives a small-peptide signal from the parasitic plant and initiates defense responses. The candidate receptor isolated from the tomato plant provided partial protection when transferred to two other susceptible plant species. Science , this issue p. 478 ; see also p. 442"

https://openalex.org/W2480617933,"This study aimed to investigate the variability of textural features (TF) as a function of acquisition and reconstruction parameters within the context of multi-centric trials.The robustness of 15 selected TFs were studied as a function of the number of iterations, the post-filtering level, input data noise, the reconstruction algorithm and the matrix size. A combination of several reconstruction and acquisition settings was devised to mimic multi-centric conditions. We retrospectively studied data from 26 patients enrolled in a diagnostic study that aimed to evaluate the performance of PET/CT 68Ga-DOTANOC in gastro-entero-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. Forty-one tumors were extracted and served as the database. The coefficient of variation (COV) or the absolute deviation (for the noise study) was derived and compared statistically with SUVmax and SUVmean results.The majority of investigated TFs can be used in a multi-centric context when each parameter is considered individually. The impact of voxel size and noise in the input data were predominant as only 4 TFs presented a high/intermediate robustness against SUV-based metrics (Entropy, Homogeneity, RP and ZP). When combining several reconstruction settings to mimic multi-centric conditions, most of the investigated TFs were robust enough against SUVmax except Correlation, Contrast, LGRE, LGZE and LZLGE.Considering previously published results on either reproducibility or sensitivity against delineation approach and our findings, it is feasible to consider Homogeneity, Entropy, Dissimilarity, HGRE, HGZE and ZP as relevant for being used in multi-centric trials."
https://openalex.org/W2498460930,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression by promoting degradation and/or repressing translation of specific target mRNAs. Several miRNAs have been identified that regulate the amplitude of the innate immune response by directly targeting Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathway members and/or cytokines. miR-33a and miR-33b (the latter present in primates but absent in rodents and lower species) are located in introns of the sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-encoding genes and control cholesterol/lipid homeostasis in concert with their host gene products. These miRNAs regulate macrophage cholesterol by targeting the lipid efflux transporters ATP binding cassette (ABC)A1 and ABCG1. We and others have previously reported that Abca1−/− and Abcg1−/− macrophages have increased TLR proinflammatory responses due to augmented lipid raft cholesterol. Given this, we hypothesized that miR-33 would augment TLR signaling in macrophages via a raft cholesterol-dependent mechanism. Herein, we report that multiple TLR ligands down-regulate miR-33 in murine macrophages. In the case of lipopolysaccharide, this is a delayed, Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β-dependent response that also down-regulates Srebf-2, the host gene for miR-33. miR-33 augments macrophage lipid rafts and enhances proinflammatory cytokine induction and NF-κB activation by LPS. This occurs through an ABCA1- and ABCG1-dependent mechanism and is reversible by interventions upon raft cholesterol and by ABC transporter-inducing liver X receptor agonists. Taken together, these findings extend the purview of miR-33, identifying it as an indirect regulator of innate immunity that mediates bidirectional cross-talk between lipid homeostasis and inflammation.

https://openalex.org/W2506496078,"We looked at a disease-associated macrosatellite array D4Z4 and focused on epigenetic factors influencing its chromatin state outside of the disease-context. We used the HCT116 cell line that contains the non-canonical polyadenylation (poly-A) signal required to stabilize somatic transcripts of the human double homeobox gene DUX4, encoded from D4Z4. In HCT116, D4Z4 is packaged into constitutive heterochromatin, characterized by DNA methylation and histone H3 tri-methylation at lysine 9 (H3K9me3), resulting in low basal levels of D4Z4-derived transcripts. However, a double knockout (DKO) of DNA methyltransferase genes, DNMT1 and DNMT3B, but not either alone, results in significant loss of DNA and H3K9 methylation. This is coupled with upregulation of transcript levels from the array, including DUX4 isoforms (DUX4-fl) that are abnormally expressed in somatic muscle in the disease Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) along with DUX4 protein, as indicated indirectly by upregulation of bondafide targets of DUX4 in DKO but not HCT116 cells. Results from treatment with a chemical inhibitor of histone methylation in HCT116 suggest that in the absence of DNA hypomethylation, H3K9me3 loss alone is sufficient to facilitate DUX4-fl transcription. Additionally, characterization of a cell line from a patient with Immunodeficiency, Centromeric instability and Facial anomalies syndrome 1 (ICF1) possessing a non-canonical poly-A signal and DNA hypomethylation at D4Z4 showed DUX4 target gene upregulation in the patient when compared to controls in spite of retention of H3K9me3. Taken together, these data suggest that both DNA methylation and H3K9me3 are determinants of D4Z4 silencing. Moreover, we show that in addition to testis, there is appreciable expression of spliced and polyadenylated D4Z4 derived transcripts that contain the complete DUX4 open reading frame (ORF) along with DUX4 target gene expression in the thymus, suggesting that DUX4 may provide normal function in this somatic tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2475616965,"Chemokines, a large family of highly versatile small soluble proteins, play crucial roles in defining innate and adaptive immune responses by regulating the trafficking of leukocytes, and also play a key role in various aspects of human physiology. Chemokines share the characteristic feature of reversibly existing as monomers and dimers, and their functional response is intimately coupled to interaction with glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Currently, nothing is known regarding the structural basis or molecular mechanisms underlying CXCL5-GAG interactions. To address this missing knowledge, we characterized the interaction of a panel of heparin oligosaccharides to CXCL5 using solution NMR, isothermal titration calorimetry, and molecular dynamics simulations. NMR studies indicated that the dimer is the high-affinity GAG binding ligand and that lysine residues from the N-loop, 40s turn, β3 strand, and C-terminal helix mediate binding. Isothermal titration calorimetry indicated a stoichiometry of two oligosaccharides per CXCL5 dimer. NMR-based structural models reveal that these residues form a contiguous surface within a monomer and, interestingly, that the GAG-binding domain overlaps with the receptor-binding domain, indicating that a GAG-bound chemokine cannot activate the receptor. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that the roles of the individual lysines are not equivalent and that helical lysines play a more prominent role in determining binding geometry and affinity. Further, binding interactions and GAG geometry in CXCL5 are novel and distinctly different compared with the related chemokines CXCL1 and CXCL8. We conclude that a finely tuned balance between the GAG-bound dimer and free soluble monomer regulates CXCL5-mediated receptor signaling and function."
https://openalex.org/W2485012013,"Objectives The present study aimed to investigate the prevalence of central obesity among adults with normal BMI and its association with metabolic diseases in Jilin Province, China. Methods A population-based cross-sectional study was conducted in 2012 in Jilin Province of China. Information was collected by face to face interview. Descriptive data analysis and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of prevalence/frequency were conducted. Log-binomial regression analyses were used to find the independent factors associated with central obesity and to explore the adjusted association between central obesity and metabolic diseases among adults with normal BMI. Results Among the adult residents with normal BMI in Jilin Province, 55.6% of participants with central obesity self-assessed as normal weight and 27.0% thought their body weight were above normal. 12.7% of central obesity people took methods to lose weight, while 85.3% didn’t. Female, older people and non-manual worker had higher risk to be central obesity among adults with normal BMI. Hypertension, diabetes and hyperlipidemia were significantly associated with central obesity among adults with normal BMI, the PRs were 1.337 (1.224–1.461), 1.323 (1.193–1.456) and 1.261 (1.152–1.381) separately when adjusted for gender, age and BMI. Conclusions Hypertension, diabetes and hyperlipidemia were significantly associated with central obesity among adults with normal BMI in Jilin Province, China. The low rates of awareness and control of central obesity among adults with normal BMI should be improved by government and health department."
https://openalex.org/W2491619508,"Introduction Although much attention has been given to the global three-dimensional aspect of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS), the accurate three-dimensional morphology of the primary and compensatory curves, as well as the intervening junctional segments, in the scoliotic spine has not been described before. Methods A unique series of 77 AIS patients with high-resolution CT scans of the spine, acquired for surgical planning purposes, were included and compared to 22 healthy controls. Non-idiopathic curves were excluded. Endplate segmentation and local longitudinal axis in endplate plane enabled semi-automatic geometric analysis of the complete three-dimensional morphology of the spine, taking inter-vertebral rotation, intra-vertebral torsion and coronal and sagittal tilt into account. Intraclass correlation coefficients for interobserver reliability were 0.98–1.00. Coronal deviation, axial rotation and the exact length discrepancies in the reconstructed sagittal plane, as defined per vertebra and disc, were analyzed for each primary and compensatory curve as well as for the junctional segments in-between. Results The anterior-posterior difference of spinal length, based on “true” anterior and posterior points on endplates, was +3.8% for thoracic and +9.4% for (thoraco)lumbar curves, while the junctional segments were almost straight. This differed significantly from control group thoracic kyphosis (-4.1%; P<0.001) and lumbar lordosis (+7.8%; P<0.001). For all primary as well as compensatory curves, we observed linear correlations between the coronal Cobb angle, axial rotation and the anterior-posterior length difference (r≥0.729 for thoracic curves; r≥0.485 for (thoraco)lumbar curves). Conclusions Excess anterior length of the spine in AIS has been described as a generalized growth disturbance, causing relative anterior spinal overgrowth. This study is the first to demonstrate that this anterior overgrowth is not a generalized phenomenon. It is confined to the primary as well as the compensatory curves, the junctional zones do not exhibit this growth discrepancy, however, they are straight."

Objective To elucidate the involvement of B cells in Crohn’s disease, we here performed an ‘in depth’ analysis of intestinal and blood B-cells in this chronic inflammatory disease. Methods Patients with Crohn’s disease were recruited to study B-cell infiltrates in intestinal biopsies (n = 5), serum immunoglobulin levels and the phenotype and molecular characteristics of blood B-cell subsets (n = 21). The effects of infliximab treatment were studied in 9 patients. Results Granulomatous tissue showed infiltrates of B lymphocytes rather than Ig-secreting plasma cells. Circulating transitional B cells and CD21low B cells were elevated. IgM memory B cells were reduced and natural effector cells showed decreased replication histories and somatic hypermutation (SHM) levels. In contrast, IgG and IgA memory B cells were normally present and their Ig gene transcripts carried increased SHM levels. The numbers of transitional and natural effector cells were normal in patients who responded clinically well to infliximab. Conclusions B cells in patients with Crohn’s disease showed signs of chronic stimulation with localization to granulomatous tissue and increased molecular maturation of IgA and IgG. Therapy with TNFα-blockers restored the defect in IgM memory B-cell generation and normalized transitional B-cell levels, making these subsets candidate markers for treatment monitoring. Together, these results suggest a chronic, aberrant B-cell response in patients with Crohn’s disease, which could be targeted with new therapeutics that specifically regulate B-cell function."
https://openalex.org/W2476290175,"Sea-level rise is a major factor in wetland loss worldwide, and in much of Chesapeake Bay (USA) the rate of sea-level rise is higher than the current global rate of 3.2 mm yr-1 due to regional subsidence. Marshes along estuarine salinity gradients differ in vegetation composition, productivity, decomposition pathways, and sediment dynamics, and may exhibit different responses to sea-level rise. Coastal marshes persist by building vertically at rates at or exceeding regional sea-level rise. In one of the first studies to examine elevation dynamics across an estuarine salinity gradient, we installed 15 surface elevation tables (SET) and accretion marker-horizon plots (MH) in tidal freshwater, oligohaline, and brackish marshes across a Chesapeake Bay subestuary. Over the course of four years, wetlands across the subestuary decreased 1.8 ± 2.7 mm yr-1 in elevation on average, at least 5 mm yr-1 below that needed to keep pace with global sea-level rise. Elevation change rates did not significantly differ among the marshes studied, and ranged from -9.8 ± 6.9 to 4.5 ± 4.3 mm yr-1. Surface accretion of deposited mineral and organic matter was uniformly high across the estuary (~9-15 mm yr-1), indicating that elevation loss was not due to lack of accretionary input. Position in the estuary and associated salinity regime were not related to elevation change or surface matter accretion. Previous studies have focused on surface elevation change in marshes of uniform salinity (e.g., salt marshes); however, our findings highlight the need for elevation studies in marshes of all salinity regimes and different geomorphic positions, and warn that brackish, oligohaline, and freshwater tidal wetlands may be at similarly high risk of submergence in some estuaries."

The impact of these variations on specific cognitive and emotional aspects of empathy, however, remains to be clarified.We analysed associations of a common OXTR polymorphism (rs53576) with trait empathy in a sample of 421 blood donors (231 M, 190 F; age 18-74) using the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) as an established multidimensional self-report measure of empathy.Female sex was significantly associated with higher empathy scores in all IRI scales (p<0.001) with the exception of the cognitive perspective taking scale (p = 0.09). The overall trait empathy score was significantly associated with rs53576 (p = 0.01), with mean scores increasing from AA to GG genotypes. An analysis of the IRI subscores revealed that the polymorphism was especially associated with the emotional empathic concern scale (p = 0.02). Separate analysis of the male and female subgroup revealed a significant association of the polymorphism with female (p = 0.04), but not with male (p = 0.20) empathic concern. A comparison of effect sizes between the groups showed greater effects for women compared to men although effect size differences did not become significant in our sample.Our findings suggest a significant association of the rs53576 OXTR gene polymorphism with trait empathy and especially with emotional aspects of empathy. This association is possibly weaker or absent in men compared to women."

https://openalex.org/W2494656625,"Introduction In Ethiopia, even if a significant reduction in child mortality is recorded recently, perinatal mortality rate is still very high. This study assessed the magnitude, determinants and causes of perinatal death in West Gojam zone, Ethiopia. Methods and materials A nested case control study was conducted on 102 cases (mothers who lost their newborns for perinatal death) and 204 controls (mothers who had live infants in the same year) among a cohort of 4097 pregnant mothers in three districts of the West Gojam zone, from Feb 2011 to Mar 2012. Logistic regression models were used to identify the independent determinant factors for perinatal mortality. The World Health Organization verbal autopsy instrument for neonatal death was used to collect mortality data and cause of death was assigned by a pediatrician and a neonatologist. Result Perinatal mortality rate was 25.1(95% CI 20.3, 29.9) per 1000 live and stillbirths. Primiparous mothers had a higher risk of losing their newborn babies for perinatal death than mothers who gave birth to five or more children (AOR = 3.15, 95% CI 1.03–9.60). Babies who were born to women who had a previous history of losing their baby to perinatal death during their last pregnancy showed higher odds of perinatal death than their counterparts (AOR = 9.55, 95% CI 4.67–19.54). Preterm newborns were more at risk for perinatal death (AOR = 9.44, 95%CI 1.81–49.22) than term babies. Newborns who were born among a household of more than two had a lesser risk of dying during the perinatal period as compared to those who were born among a member of only two. Paradoxically, home delivery was found to protect against perinatal death (AOR = 0.07 95% CI, 0.02–0.24) in comparison to institutional delivery. Bacterial sepsis, birth asphyxia and obstructed labour were among the leading causes of perinatal death. Conclusion Perinatal mortality rate remains considerably high, but proper maternal and child health care services can significantly decrease the burden."

A temperature of 48.9°C, E/S ratio of 1.60%, pH 3.0, hydrolysis time of 2.5 h was found to be the optimum condition to obtain wheat gluten hydrolysate with higher EAI. The solubility of wheat gluten was greatly improved by hydrolysis and became independent of pH over the studied range. Enzymatic hydrolysis resulted in dramatically increase in EAI, water and oil holding capacity. Molecular weight distribution results showed that most of the peptides above 10 kDa have been hydrolyzed into smaller peptides. The results of FTIR spectra and disulfide bond (SS) and sulfhydryl (SH) content suggested that a more extensional conformation was formed after hydrolysis, which could account for the improved functional properties."
https://openalex.org/W2477145051,"Objective It is well known that atherosclerotic inflammatory vascular disease is critically driven by oxidized lipids and cytokines. In this regard, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α is known as a crucial mediator of early pro-atherosclerotic events. Epidemiologic data suggest that blockade of TNF-α has beneficial effects on vascular outcomes in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, however, detailed mechanistic studies are still lacking. This study aims to elucidate effects of TNF-α blockade by adalimumab–which is approved for several inflammatory disorders–on endothelial activation and monocyte adhesion under pro-atherosclerotic conditions. Methods and Results Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) differentiated THP-1 macrophages were stimulated with oxidized low density lipoprotein and subsequent analysis of this conditioned media (oxLDL CM) revealed a strong release of TNF-α. The TNF-α rich supernatant led to activation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) as shown by enhanced expression of major adhesion molecules, such as vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and E-selectin which was suppressed by the TNF-α inhibitor adalimumab. Accordingly, adalimumab effectively prevented THP-1 monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells under static as well as under flow conditions. Furthermore, adalimumab suppressed endothelial leakage as shown by Evan's blue diffusion across a confluent endothelial monolayer. Of note, after intraperitoneal injection we detected abundant deposition of fluorophore-labelled adalimumab in atherosclerotic plaques of hypercholesterolemic mice. Conclusion Our results show that adalimumab prevents major inflammatory effects of TNF-α on endothelial activation, endothelial monocyte adhesion, endothelial leakage and therefore extends the therapeutic options of adalimumab to limit vascular inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2494287089,"Ochratoxin A (OTA)-a toxin produced by Aspergillus carbonarius, Aspergillus ochraceus, and Penicillium verrucosum-is one of the most-abundant food-contaminating mycotoxins. To avoid the risk of OTA consumption for humans and animals, the rapid detection and quantitation of OTA level in different commodities are of great importance. In this work, an impedimetric immunosensor for ochratoxin A (OTA) detection, a common toxic botanical contaminant, was developed via the immobilization of anti-OTA antibody on bovine serum albumin modified gold electrodes. A four-step reaction protocol was tested to modify the gold electrode and obtain the sensing substrate. All the steps of the immunosensor elaboration and also the immunochemical reaction between surface-bound antibody and ochratoxin A were analyzed using cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Modification of the impedance due to the specific antigen-antibody reaction at immunosensor surface, was used in order to detect ochratoxin A. Linear proportionality of the charge transfer resistance to the concentration of OTA allows ochratoxin A detection in the range of 2.5-100 ng/mL."

https://openalex.org/W2498590714,"Tumor interstitial fluid pressure (TIFP), is a physiological parameter with demonstrated predictive value for a tumor’s aggressiveness, drug delivery, as well as response to treatments such as radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Despite its utility, measurement of TIFP has been limited by the need for invasive procedures. In this work, the theoretical basis for approaching the absolute value of TIFP and the experimental method for noninvasively measuring TIFP are presented. Given specific boundary and continuity conditions, we convert theoretical variables into measurable variables by applying MRI technology. The work shows that TIFP in the central region of the tumor can be estimated by an analysis of the variation of tissue fluid motion in the tumor rim and surrounding tissue. It is determined from three noninvasive measurable parameters: i) an estimate of the velocity of the tumor interstitial fluid at the tumor surface, which is maximal, ii) a measurement of the distance from the tumor surface to where the tumor exudates are absorbed (or normalized), and iii) an estimate of the hydraulic conductivity of the interstitium through which the tumor exudate travels. We experimentally show that the fluid flow within the tumor rim is not uniform, even for a round shaped tumor, and demonstrate the procedures for the noninvasive measurement of TIFP."

In a mouse retina, RD3 inhibited both RetGC1 and RetGC2 isozymes. Photoreceptors in the rd3/rd3 mouse retinas lacking functional RD3 degenerated more severely than in the retinas lacking both RetGC isozymes, consistent with a hypothesis that the inhibitory activity of RD3 has a functional role in photoreceptors. To map the potential target-binding site(s) on RD3, short evolutionary conserved regions of its primary structure were scrambled and the mutations were tested for the RD3 ability to inhibit RetGC1 and co-localize with the cyclase in co-transfected cells. Substitutions in 4 out of 22 tested regions, 87KIHP90, 93CGPAI97, 99RFRQ102, and 119RSVL122, reduced the RD3 apparent affinity for the cyclase 180–700-fold. Changes of amino acid sequences outside the Lys87–Leu122 central portion of the molecule either failed to prevent RD3 binding to the cyclase or had a much smaller effect. Mutations in the 93CGPAI97 portion of a predicted central α-helix most drastically suppressed the inhibitory activity of RD3 and disrupted RD3 co-localization with RetGC1 in HEK293 cells. Different side chains replacing Cys93 profoundly reduced RD3 affinity for the cyclase, irrespective of their relative helix propensities.

We previously reported that RD3 is a very potent high-affinity inhibitor of the cyclase catalytic activity as well as its activation by GCAPs in vitro (4Peshenko I.V. Olshevskaya E.V. Azadi S.

Although the details of the mechanism through which GCAPs bind and regulate RetGC have gradually become understood, the function of RD3 as a negative regulator of the photoreceptor cyclase, as well as its physiological role, remains less clear. Adding even more importance to that subject, some mutations in RetGC1 that cause Leber congenital amaurosis, a severe from of an early-onset blindness, interfere with the cyclase binding of GCAPs and RD3 altogether (4Peshenko I.V.

We hypothesized that blocking the cyclase activity by high-affinity RD3 binding could prevent premature activation of RetGC in the inner segment of the photoreceptor, before it reaches its proper destination in the outer segment (4Peshenko I.V.

Neither the structure of RD3 nor the molecular mechanisms of its binding to the target enzyme are presently understood. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to further elucidate the RD3 function as a negative regulator of the cyclase and to identify the parts of the RD3 molecule that form its RetGC-binding interface. We find that the main part of RetGC-binding interface occupies helical regions in the central portion of the RD3 molecule. We previously demonstrated (4Peshenko I.V. Olshevskaya E.V. Azadi S.

There are two isozymes of the cyclase, RetGC1 and RetGC2 (10Dizhoor A.M. Lowe D.G. Olshevskaya E.V. Laura R.P. Hurley J.B.

Therefore, we tested whether or not both isozymes present in the native mouse photoreceptor membrane were sensitive to inhibition by RD3. To segregate the individual RetGC1 and RetGC2 isozyme activities, we used rod outer segment (ROS) fractions isolated from retinas lacking genes coding for GCAP1, GCAP2, and one of the RetGC isozymes: RetGC2−/− GCAPs−/− and RetGC1−/−GCAPs−/− (13Peshenko I.V.

We found that mouse RD3 effectively suppressed basal catalytic activity of both native RetGC isozymes in the absence of GCAPs (Fig. 1, A and B). Human RD3 has been shown to prevent activation of a recombinant human RetGC1 by GCAP1 and GCAP2, by effectively competing with GCAPs (4Peshenko I.V. Olshevskaya E.V. Azadi S. Molday L.L. Molday R.S.

We found that mouse RD3 also suppressed activation of the native mouse RetGC isozymes by mouse GCAPs (Fig. 1, C and D) in GCAPs−/− ROS. What is more, RD3 effectively competed with the native mouse cyclase activation by GCAP1 or GCAP2 when its concentrations in the assay were ∼100-fold lower than GCAPs.

Normalized per the photoreceptor content at 1 month of age (158 ± 15 nuclei count per 100 μm of the rd3/rd3 retina section, n = 8, versus 227 ± 14 in wild type, n = 6), the RetGC activity was 10-fold reduced in rd3/rd3 retinas at that age (0.07 ± 0.01 versus 0.68 ± 0.035 nmol of cGMP/min/retina in wild type, Fig. 2A). However, it was far from being completely absent. Moreover, consistent with the original observation by Friedman et al. (2Friedman J.S. Chang B. Kannabiran C. Chakarova C. Singh H.P. Jalali S.

In contrast, the double RetGC knock-out mice (indicated by GCdKO), which, despite only a minor loss of photoreceptor nuclei count at that age (202 ± 13 per 100 μm, n = 4), completely lacked detectable RetGC activity (Fig. 2A) and, as originally documented by Baehr et al. (14Baehr W. Karan S. Maeda T. Luo D.G. Li S. Bronson J.D. Watt C.B. Yau K.W. Frederick J.M. Palczewski K. The function of guanylate cyclase 1 and guanylate cyclase 2 in rod and cone photoreceptors.J.

In rd3/rd3, the average a-wave amplitude at 1 month of age was 105 ± 14 μV (n = 5), when compared with 454 ± 41 μV (n = 6) in wild type (p < 0.0001, unpaired t test), and the respective average b-wave amplitudes were 445 ± 59 and 886 ± 91 μV (p = 0.0037). We hence reasoned that if the lower levels of RetGC in outer segments (3Azadi S. Molday L.L. Molday R.S. RD3, the protein associated with Leber congenital amaurosis type 12, is required for guanylate cyclase trafficking in photoreceptor cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Chem. 2007; 282: 8837-8847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), would cause photoreceptors to degenerate even faster. However, a direct comparison of the retinal morphology between the rd3/rd3 and the RetGC1−/−RetGC2−/− mice at 5 months of age revealed just the opposite (Fig. 2D). It is important to point out that genetic background can reportedly influence the rate of the rd3 retinal degeneration in different mouse strains (2Friedman J.S. Chang B. Kannabiran C. Chakarova C. Singh H.P. Jalali S. Hawes N.L. Branham K. Othman M. Filippova E. Thompson D.A. Webster A.R. Andréasson S. Jacobson S.G.

Genet. 2006; 79: 1059-1070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Therefore, to avoid ambiguity in making a direct comparison, in the present study, we first outcrossed rd3, RetGC1−/−, and RetGC2−/− lines to the C57B6J strain for 10 consecutive generations to make them conventionally congenic and only then bred them into their respective rd3/rd3 or RetGC1−/−RetGC2−/− homozygous states. The loss of photoreceptors in rd3/rd3 mice at 5 months was more pronounced than in the RetGC1−/−RetGC2−/− double knock-out (Fig. 2, D and E). The vast majority of the photoreceptor nuclei in the rd3/rd3 outer nuclear layer disappeared, leaving typically just one row of nuclei when compared with the 9–11 rows in the wild type (ERG also became undetectable in rd3/rd3 at that age (not shown)). In contrast, the retinas completely lacking the cyclase activity from birth retained as many as 4–6 nuclei rows, nearly half the normal photoreceptor layer thickness. The average number of photoreceptors in RetGC1−/−RetGC2−/− and rd3/rd3 retinas was respectively reduced to 48%, and 14% in normal retinas. Average photoreceptor nuclei counts in wild type, RetGC1−/−RetGC2−/−, and rd3/rd3 mice were 237 ± 11 (n = 4), 113 ± 6 (n = 5), and 33 ± 6 (n = 5), respectively; the difference between all pairs was significant (p < 0.0001 at 99.9% confidence level, analysis of variance/Bonferroni post hoc test). The RetGC double knock-out retinas also had a thinner than normal yet clearly recognizable layer of outer segments, whereas none could be identified at that age in the rudiments of the rd3/rd3 photoreceptor cell layer (Fig. 2D, bottom row). The outer nuclear layer in several tested RetGC1−/−RetGC2−/− retinas still retained >40% normal nuclei count per 100 μm (110 ± 2, n = 4) even after 6 months of age, whereas only sporadic nuclei that possibly belonged to photoreceptors could be encountered in rd3/rd3 (7 ± 1, n = 3) (not shown). Evidently, these results argued that lower levels of RetGC expression could not fully explain the fast photoreceptor degeneration in rd3/rd3 mice and pointed at the lack of another RD3 function, its being a potent inhibitor of the cyclase (Fig. 1) (4Peshenko I.V. Olshevskaya E.V. Azadi S. Molday L.L. Molday R.S. Dizhoor A.M.

The structure of RD3 remains unknown, largely due to its previously noted poor solubility (4Peshenko I.V. Olshevskaya E.V. Azadi S. Molday L.L. Molday R.S. Dizhoor A.M.

Therefore, here we only refer to the predicted RD3 secondary structure (8Molday L.L. Jefferies T. Molday R.S. Insights into the role of RD3 in guanylate cyclase trafficking, photoreceptor degeneration, and Leber congenital amaurosis.Front. Mol. Neurosci. 2014; 7: 44Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). We reasoned that the RetGC-binding interface on RD3 would likely include hydrophilic amino acid residues that are more likely to be exposed on the surface of the molecule and are most conserved among different animal species (Fig. 3). We hence selected 22 short peptide regions in a human RD3 primary structure containing hydrophilic residues, and then scrambled their sequences, either by simply changing the order of the same residues in the region or by additionally replacing some of the hydrophilic side chains in the sequence, such as positively charged to neutral or negatively charged or vice versa (Table 1). We chose to avoid changing strongly conserved extended hydrophobic regions to minimize the potential effects of changing parts of a hydrophobic core on the backbone fold. When we replaced hydrophobic residues in the mutated fragments, we used homologous replacements, such as Ile to Leu, Val or Ala. We then screened purified RD3 mutants for a drastic change in their ability to suppress RetGC1 activity at 0.1 μm RD3, concentration at which wild type RD3 suppressed GCAP1-activated RetGC1 10-fold (Fig. 4A). Among the 22 tested regions, mutations in four of them, 87KIHP90, 93CGPAI97, 99RFRQ102, and 119RSVL122, strongly negated the RD3 inhibitory effect: only ≤20% of the RetGC1 activity was lost when compared with the >90% loss in case of wild type RD3 (Table 1, Fig. 4B). One of these four regions, 93CGPAI97, was particularly sensitive to the change of its amino acid sequence.TABLE 1Fractional RetGC1 activity in the presence of 0.1 μm RD3FragmentMutationFractional RetGC1 activity21PAEM24APME0.21 ± 0.0227ETLM30QMVT0.51 ± 0.0235GQMR38ERLG0.19 ± 0.0141ERQQ44KREQ0.22 ± 0.0150AVRK53KAIE0.13 ± 0.0155CTGVD59GNCDV0.34 ± 0.0277ERLQ80QLRE0.12 ± 0.0182EDVC85QVDS0.39 ± 0.0187KIHP90PHRL0.86 ± 0.01aa RD3 mutants for which ARD3 ≥0.8 A0 in the standard assay conditions.93CGPAI97PALSL0.93 ± 0.02aa RD3 mutants for which ARD3 ≥0.8 A0 in the standard assay conditions.99RFRQ102FRQR0.87 ± 0.08aa RD3 mutants for which ARD3 ≥0.8 A0 in the standard assay conditions.107QEPEV111PVQEE0.40 ± 0.01112QEV114EVQ0.35 ± 0.01119RSVL122LAER0.80 ± 0.01aa RD3 mutants for which ARD3 ≥0.8 A0 in the standard assay conditions.Met129D0.11 ± 0.00132EEE134KKK0.12 ± 0.01137KLTRQ141QRKTL0.09 ± 0.01147RGSL150GRLS0.10 ± 0.01154KTRAR158ENSES0.08 ± 0.01164SDIRT168RSDTI0.10 ± 0.01170EDVERD175KKAKQR0.05 ± 0.03178PPP180AAA0.10 ± 0.03186SMP188PRS0.13 ± 0.00Wild type0.08 ± 0.01a a RD3 mutants for which ARD3 ≥0.8 A0 in the standard assay conditions. Open table in a new tab The four most strongly affected RD3 mutants were tested for their dose dependence of RetGC1 inhibition (Fig. 5). The mutants were able to partially reduce RetGC1 activation at high concentrations, but when compared with the wild type, their apparent affinities became reduced 18–700-fold. Hence, the loss of the inhibitory activity in Fig. 4B and Table 1 was due to a dramatic reduction in the RD3 binding affinity for the target enzyme. To further verify that the binding to the target enzyme became affected, we tested the RD3 binding to RetGC1 using the in cyto method, in which GFP-tagged RD3 and mOrange-tagged RetGC1 were co-expressed in HEK293 cells (9Peshenko I.V.

https://openalex.org/W2504162175,"Background Facial emotion recognition (FER) is essential to guide social functioning and behaviour for interpersonal communication. FER may be altered in severe mental illness such as in psychosis and in borderline personality disorder patients. However, it is unclear if these FER alterations are specifically related to psychosis. Awareness of FER alterations may be useful in clinical settings to improve treatment strategies. The aim of our study was to examine FER in patients with severe mental disorder and their relation with psychotic symptomatology. Materials and Methods Socio-demographic and clinical variables were collected. Alterations on emotion recognition were assessed in 3 groups: patients with first episode psychosis (FEP) (n = 64), borderline personality patients (BPD) (n = 37) and healthy controls (n = 137), using the Degraded Facial Affect Recognition Task. The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Structured Interview for Schizotypy Revised and Community Assessment of Psychic Experiences scales were used to assess positive psychotic symptoms. WAIS III subtests were used to assess IQ. Results Kruskal-Wallis analysis showed a significant difference between groups on the FER of neutral faces score between FEP, BPD patients and controls and between FEP patients and controls in angry face recognition. No significant differences were found between groups in the fear or happy conditions. There was a significant difference between groups in the attribution of negative emotion to happy faces. BPD and FEP groups had a much higher tendency to recognize happy faces as negatives. There was no association with the different symptom domains in either group. Conclusions FEP and BPD patients have problems in recognizing neutral faces more frequently than controls. Moreover, patients tend to over-report negative emotions in recognition of happy faces. Although no relation between psychotic symptoms and FER alterations was found, these deficits could contribute to a patient’s misinterpretations in daily life."
https://openalex.org/W2480166485,"Aims Bleeding is a frequent complication in patients on venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO). An indication for dual antiplatelet therapy due to coronary stent implantation is present in a considerable number of these patients. The objective of this retrospective study was to evaluate if dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) significantly increases the high intrinsic bleeding risk in patients on VA-ECMO. Methods and Results A total of 93 patients were treated with VA-ECMO between October 2010 and October 2013. Average time on VA-ECMO was 58.9 ± 1.7 hours. Dual antiplatelet therapy was given to 51.6% of all patients. Any bleeding was recorded in 60.2% of all patients. There was no difference in bleeding incidence in patients on DAPT when compared to those without any antiplatelet therapy including any bleeding (66.7% vs. 57.1%, p = 0.35), BARC3 bleeding (43.8% vs. 33.3%, p = 0.31) or pulmonary bleeding (16.7% vs. 19.0%, p = 0.77). This holds true after adjustment for confounders. Rate of transfusion of red blood cells were similar in patients with or without DAPT (35.4% vs. 28.6%, p = 0.488). Conclusions Bleeding on VA-ECMO is frequent. This registry recorded no statistical difference in bleeding in patients on dual antiplatelet therapy when compared to no antiplatelet therapy. When indicated, DAPT should not be withheld from VA ECMO patients."
https://openalex.org/W2477459069,"The consequences of ubiquitous exposure to environmental chemicals remain poorly defined. Non-targeted metabolomic profiling is an emerging method to identify biomarkers of the physiological response to such exposures. We investigated the effect of three commonly used ingredients in personal care products, diethyl phthalate (DEP), methylparaben (MPB) and triclosan (TCS), on the blood metabolome of female Sprague-Dawley rats. Animals were treated with low levels of these chemicals comparable to human exposures during prepubertal and pubertal windows as well as chronically from birth to adulthood. Non-targeted metabolomic profiling revealed that most of the variation in the metabolites was associated with developmental stage. The low-dose exposure to DEP, MPB and TCS had a relatively small, but detectable impact on the metabolome. Multiple metabolites that were affected by chemical exposure belonged to the same biochemical pathways including phenol sulfonation and metabolism of pyruvate, lyso-plasmalogens, unsaturated fatty acids and serotonin. Changes in phenol sulfonation and pyruvate metabolism were most pronounced in rats exposed to DEP during the prepubertal period. Our metabolomics analysis demonstrates that human level exposure to personal care product ingredients has detectable effects on the rat metabolome. We highlight specific pathways such as sulfonation that warrant further study."
https://openalex.org/W2495746023,"Targeted sequencing of PCR amplicons generated from bisulfite deaminated DNA is a flexible, cost-effective way to study methylation of a sample at single CpG resolution and perform subsequent multi-target, multi-sample comparisons. Currently, no platform specific protocol, support, or analysis solution is provided to perform targeted bisulfite sequencing on a Personal Genome Machine (PGM). Here, we present a novel tool, called TABSAT, for analyzing targeted bisulfite sequencing data generated on Ion Torrent sequencers. The workflow starts with raw sequencing data, performs quality assessment, and uses a tailored version of Bismark to map the reads to a reference genome. The pipeline visualizes results as lollipop plots and is able to deduce specific methylation-patterns present in a sample. The obtained profiles are then summarized and compared between samples. In order to assess the performance of the targeted bisulfite sequencing workflow, 48 samples were used to generate 53 different Bisulfite-Sequencing PCR amplicons from each sample, resulting in 2,544 amplicon targets. We obtained a mean coverage of 282X using 1,196,822 aligned reads. Next, we compared the sequencing results of these targets to the methylation level of the corresponding sites on an Illumina 450k methylation chip. The calculated average Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.91 confirms the sequencing results with one of the industry-leading CpG methylation platforms and shows that targeted amplicon bisulfite sequencing provides an accurate and cost-efficient method for DNA methylation studies, e.g., to provide platform-independent confirmation of Illumina Infinium 450k methylation data. TABSAT offers a novel way to analyze data generated by Ion Torrent instruments and can also be used with data from the Illumina MiSeq platform. It can be easily accessed via the Platomics platform, which offers a web-based graphical user interface along with sample and parameter storage.

https://openalex.org/W2492844688,"While the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is considered one of the most important ligaments for providing knee joint stability, its influence on rotational laxity is not fully understood and its role in resisting rotation at different flexion angles in vivo remains unknown. In this prospective study, we investigated the relationship between in vivo passive axial rotational laxity and knee flexion angle, as well as how they were altered with ACL injury and reconstruction. A rotometer device was developed to assess knee joint rotational laxity under controlled passive testing. An axial torque of ±2.5Nm was applied to the knee while synchronised fluoroscopic images of the tibia and femur allowed axial rotation of the bones to be accurately determined. Passive rotational laxity tests were completed in 9 patients with an untreated ACL injury and compared to measurements at 3 and 12 months after anatomical single bundle ACL reconstruction, as well as to the contralateral controls. Significant differences in rotational laxity were found between the injured and the healthy contralateral knees with internal rotation values of 8.7°±4.0° and 3.7°±1.4° (p = 0.003) at 30° of flexion and 9.3°±2.6° and 4.0°±2.0° (p = 0.001) at 90° respectively. After 3 months, the rotational laxity remained similar to the injured condition, and significantly different to the healthy knees. However, after 12 months, a considerable reduction of rotational laxity was observed towards the levels of the contralateral controls. The significantly greater laxity observed at both knee flexion angles after 3 months (but not at 12 months), suggests an initial lack of post-operative rotational stability, possibly due to reduced mechanical properties or fixation stability of the graft tissue. After 12 months, reduced levels of rotational laxity compared with the injured and 3 month conditions, both internally and externally, suggests progressive rotational stability of the reconstruction with time."
https://openalex.org/W2502789821,"Analysis of the Escherichia coli transcriptome identified a unique subset of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) that contain a conventional untranslated leader and Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence upstream of the gene’s start codon while also containing an AUG triplet at the mRNA’s 5’- terminus (5’-uAUG). Fusion of the coding sequence specified by the 5’-terminal putative AUG start codon to a lacZ reporter gene, as well as primer extension inhibition assays, reveal that the majority of the 5’-terminal upstream open reading frames (5’-uORFs) tested support some level of lacZ translation, indicating that these mRNAs can function both as leaderless and canonical SD-leadered mRNAs. Although some of the uORFs were expressed at low levels, others were expressed at levels close to that of the respective downstream genes and as high as the naturally leaderless cI mRNA of bacteriophage λ. These 5’-terminal uORFs potentially encode peptides of varying lengths, but their functions, if any, are unknown. In an effort to determine whether expression from the 5’-terminal uORFs impact expression of the immediately downstream cistron, we examined expression from the downstream coding sequence after mutations were introduced that inhibit efficient 5’-uORF translation. These mutations were found to affect expression from the downstream cistrons to varying degrees, suggesting that some 5’-uORFs may play roles in downstream regulation. Since the 5’-uAUGs found on these conventionally leadered mRNAs can function to bind ribosomes and initiate translation, this indicates that canonical mRNAs containing 5’-uAUGs should be examined for their potential to function also as leaderless mRNAs."

We focus on the implications that future snow declines may have for oversnow vehicle (snowmobile and snowcoach) use because oversnow tourism is critical to the local economy and has been a contentious issue in the park for more than 30 years. Using temperature-indexed snow melt and accumulation equations with temperature and precipitation data from downscaled global climate models, we forecast the number of days that will be suitable for oversnow travel on each Yellowstone road segment during the mid- and late-21st century. The west entrance road was forecast to be the least suitable for oversnow use in the future while the south entrance road was forecast to remain at near historical levels of driveability. The greatest snow losses were forecast for the west entrance road where as little as 29% of the December-March oversnow season was forecast to be driveable by late century. The climatic conditions that allow oversnow vehicle use in Yellowstone are forecast by our methods to deteriorate significantly in the future. At some point it may be prudent to consider plowing the roads that experience the greatest snow losses."
https://openalex.org/W2503297337,"This study evaluated the influence of an altitude training (AT) camp on swimming start time and loaded squat jump performance. To accomplish this goal, 13 international swimmers (8 women, 5 men) were allocated to both the control (Sea Level Training, SLT) and experimental conditions (AT, 2320 m above sea level) that were separated by a one year period. All tests (15 m freestyle swimming start and loaded squat jumps with additional loads of 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% of swimmers' body weight) were performed before and after a concurrent 3-week strength and endurance training program prescribed by the national coach. Following the SLT camp, significant impairments in swimming start times to 10 (+3.1%) and 15 m (+4.0%) were observed (P < 0.05), whereas no significant changes for the same distances were detected following the AT camp (-0.89%; P > 0.05). Trivial changes in peak velocity were obtained during the loaded squat jump after both training periods (effect sizes: < 0.20). Based on these results we can conclude that a traditional training high-living high strategy concurrent training of 3 weeks does not adversely affect swimming start time and loaded squat jump performance in high level swimmers, but further studies are necessary to assess the effectiveness of power-oriented resistance training in the development of explosive actions."

Here, the interplay of upstream flow confluence and downstream flow divergence was hypothesized to be a determinant factor for the hemodynamic distribution in the vertebrobasilar system. A computational fluid dynamics model was used to compute the flow fields in patient-specific vertebrobasilar models (n = 6). The inlet and outlet boundary conditions were the aortic pressure waveform and flow resistances, respectively. A 50% reduction of total outlet area was found to induce a ten-fold increase in surface area ratio of low time-averaged wall shear stress (i.e., TAWSS ≤ 4 dynes/cm2).

https://openalex.org/W2488453649,"NMDA receptors have been widely reported to be involved in the regulation of synaptic plasticity through effects on long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). LTP and LTD have been implicated in learning and memory processes. Besides synaptic plasticity, it is known that the phenomenon of gamma oscillations is critical in cognitive functions. Synaptic plasticity has been widely studied, however it is still not clear, to what degree synaptic plasticity regulates the oscillations of neuronal networks. Two NMDA receptor antagonists, ketamine and memantine, have been shown to regulate LTP and LTD, to promote cognitive functions, and have even been reported to bring therapeutic effects in major depression and Alzheimer's disease respectively. These compounds allow us to investigate the putative interrelationship between network oscillations and synaptic plasticity and to learn more about the mechanisms of their therapeutic effects. In the present study, we have identified that ketamine and memantine could inhibit LTD, without impairing LTP in the CA1 region of mouse hippocampus, which may underlie the mechanism of these drugs' therapeutic effects. Our results suggest that NMDA-induced LTD caused a marked loss in the gamma power, and pretreatment with 10 μM ketamine prevented the oscillatory loss via its inhibitory effect on LTD. Our study provides a new understanding of the role of NMDA receptors on hippocampal plasticity and oscillations."
https://openalex.org/W2506507736,"Disease in the spinal cord is a major component of disability in multiple sclerosis, yet current techniques of imaging spinal cord injury are insensitive and nonspecific. This study seeks to remove this major impediment to research in multiple sclerosis and other spinal cord diseases by identifying reliable biomarkers of disability progression using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), a magnetic resonance imaging technique, to evaluate the spinal cord in a model of multiple sclerosis, i.e. the Theiler’s Murine Encephalitis Virus-Induced Demyelinating Disease (TMEV-IDD). Mice with TMEV-IDD with varying levels of clinical disease were imaged using a 9.4T small animal MRI scanner. Axial diffusivity, radial diffusivity, and fractional anisotropy were calculated. Disability was assessed periodically using Rotarod assay and data were expressed as a neurological function index. Correlation was performed between DTI measurements and disability scores. TMEV-IDD mice displayed significant increased neurological deficits over time when compared with controls (p<0.0001). Concurrently, the values of fractional anisotropy and axial diffusivity were both decreased compared to controls (both p<0.0001), while radial diffusivity was increased (p<0.0001). Overall, fractional anisotropy changes were larger in white matter than in grey matter and differences were more pronounced in the ventral region. Lower disability scores were associated with decreased fractional anisotropy values measured in the ventral (r = 0.68; p<0.0001) and ventral-lateral (r = 0.70; p<0.0001) regions of the white matter. These data demonstrate that DTI measures of the spinal cord contribute to strengthening the association between neuroradiological markers and clinical disability, and support the use of DTI measures in spinal cord imaging in MS patients."

These ligand-based protein networks, which implicitly predict the ability of neighboring proteins to bind related ligands, may complement biologically-oriented gene networks, which are used to predict functional or disease relevance. To quantify the degree to which such ligand-based protein associations might complement functional genomic associations, including sequence similarity, physical protein-protein interactions, co-expression, and disease gene annotations, we calculated a network based on the Similarity Ensemble Approach (SEA: sea.docking.org), where protein neighbors reflect the similarity of their ligands. We also measured the similarity with functional genomic networks over a common set of 1,131 genes, and found that the networks had only small overlaps, which were significant only due to the large scale of the data. Consistent with the view that the networks contain different information, combining them substantially improved Molecular Function prediction within GO (from AUROC~0.63-0.75 for the individual data modalities to AUROC~0.8 in the aggregate). We investigated the boost in guilt-by-association gene function prediction when the networks are combined and describe underlying properties that can be further exploited."

Neither metal resistance nor variance in growth were detected between them and Col-0. We re-sequenced the genomes of these accessions and all stocks available for each accession. In all cases they were nearly indistinguishable from the standard laboratory accession Col-0. As Santa Clara was allegedly collected from the Jasper Ridge serpentine outcrop in California, USA we investigated the possibility of extant A. thaliana populations adapted to serpentine soils. Botanically vouchered Arabidopsis accessions in the Jepson database were overlaid with soil maps of California. This provided no evidence of A. thaliana collections from serpentine sites in California. Thus, our work demonstrates that the Santa Clara, Berkeley and Limeport accessions are not metal tolerant, not genetically distinct from Col-0, and that there are no known serpentine adapted populations or accessions of A. thaliana."
https://openalex.org/W2485018147,"The purpose of this work is to investigate the accurate trajectory tracking control of a wheeled mobile robot (WMR) based on the slip model prediction. Generally, a nonholonomic WMR may increase the slippage risk, when traveling on outdoor unstructured terrain (such as longitudinal and lateral slippage of wheels). In order to control a WMR stably and accurately under the effect of slippage, an unscented Kalman filter and neural networks (NNs) are applied to estimate the slip model in real time. This method exploits the model approximating capabilities of nonlinear state–space NN, and the unscented Kalman filter is used to train NN’s weights online. The slip parameters can be estimated and used to predict the time series of deviation velocity, which can be used to compensate control inputs of a WMR. The results of numerical simulation show that the desired trajectory tracking control can be performed by predicting the nonlinear slip model."

The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2476601 within the PTPN22 gene locus results in aberrant function of PTPN22 protein and protects from Crohn’s disease (CD). Here, we investigated associations of PTPN22 SNP rs2476601 in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients in the Swiss IBD Cohort Study (SIBDCS). Methods 2’028 SIBDCS patients (1173 CD and 855 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients) were included. The clinical characteristics were analysed for an association with the presence of the PTPN22 SNP rs2476601 genotypes ‘homozygous variant’ (AA), ‘heterozygous’ (GA) and ‘homozygous wild-type’ (GG). Results 13 patients (0.6%) were homozygous variant (AA) for the PTPN22 polymorphism, 269 (13.3%) heterozygous variant (GA) and 1’746 (86.1%) homozygous wild-type (GG). In CD, AA and GA genotypes were associated with less use of steroids and antibiotics, and reduced prevalence of vitamin D and calcium deficiency. In UC the AA and GA genotype was associated with increased use of azathioprine and anti-TNF antibodies, but significantly less patients with the PTPN22 variant featured malabsorption syndrome (p = 0.026). Conclusion Our study for the first time addressed how presence of SNP rs2476601 within the PTPN22 gene affects clinical characteristics in IBD-patients. Several factors that correlate with more severe disease were found to be less common in CD patients carrying the A-allele, pointing towards a protective role for this variant in affected CD patients. In UC patients however, we found the opposite trend, suggesting a disease-promoting effect of the A-allele."

Introduction of telaprevir (TVR) and boceprevir (BOC) has increased sustained virologic response rates (SVR) in genotype 1 patients but were accompanied by higher treatment costs and more side effects. Aim of the study was to assess outcomes and costs of treating HCV with TVR or BOC in routine care. 2. Material and Methods Data was obtained from a non-interventional study. This analysis relates on a subset of 1,786 patients for whom resource utilisation was documented. Sociodemografic and clinical parameters as well as resource utilisation were collected using a web-based data recording system. Costs were calculated using official remuneration schemes. 3. Results Mean age of patients was 49.2 years, 58.6% were male. In treatment-naive patients SVR-rates of 62.2% and 55.7% for TVR and BOC were observed (prior relapser: 68.5% for TVR and 63.5% for BOC; prior non-responder: 45.6% for TVR and 39.1% for BOC). Treatment costs are dominated by costs for pharmaceuticals and range between €39,081 and €53,491. We calculated average costs per SVR of €81,347 (TVR) and €70,163 (BOC) in treatment-naive patients (prior relapser: 78,089 €/SVR for TVR and 82,077 €/SVR for BOC; prior non-responder: 116,509 €/SVR for TVR and 110,156 €/SVR for BOC). Quality of life data showed a considerable decrease during treatment. 4. Conclusion Our study is one of few investigating both, outcomes and costs, of treating HCV in a real-life setting. Data can serve as a reference in the discussion of increasing costs in recently introduced agents."

Data from clinical records of 6565 patients (2278 men and 4287 women, median age 51, range 7‒94) who underwent upper endoscopy between 2002 and 2014 were collected. H. pylori status, assessed by histology plus rapid urease test or 13C-urea breath test, and G6PD status were also reported. A multiple logistic regression model was used to investigate the association between G6PD deficiency and H. pylori infection.Enzyme deficiency was detected in 12% (789/6565) of the entire cohort, and more specifically in 8.3% of men and in 14.0% of women. Overall, the proportion of patients positive for H. pylori was 50.6% and 51.5% among G6PD deficient and non-deficient patients (χ² = 0.271; p = 0.315). Moreover, among G6PD-deficient and normal patients the frequency of previous H. pylori infection was similar. After adjustment for age and gender the risk for acquiring H. pylori infection was similar in G6PD-deficient and normal patients. Only age was a strong statistically significant risk predictor.These results demonstrate for the first time that G6PD deficiency does not enhance patients' susceptibility to acquire H. pylori infection in Sardinia."
https://openalex.org/W2479304738,"3D-domain swapping is one of the mechanisms of protein oligomerization and the proteins exhibiting this phenomenon have many biological functions. These proteins, which undergo domain swapping, have acquired much attention owing to their involvement in human diseases, such as conformational diseases, amyloidosis, serpinopathies, proteionopathies etc. Early realisation of proteins in the whole human genome that retain tendency to domain swap will enable many aspects of disease control management. Predictive models were developed by using machine learning approaches with an average accuracy of 78% (85.6% of sensitivity, 87.5% of specificity and an MCC value of 0.72) to predict putative domain swapping in protein sequences. These models were applied to many complete genomes with special emphasis on the human genome. Nearly 44% of the protein sequences in the human genome were predicted positive for domain swapping. Enrichment analysis was performed on the positively predicted sequences from human genome for their domain distribution, disease association and functional importance based on Gene Ontology (GO). Enrichment analysis was also performed to infer a better understanding of the functional importance of these sequences. Finally, we developed hinge region prediction, in the given putative domain swapped sequence, by using important physicochemical properties of amino acids."
https://openalex.org/W2493625365,"The autophagy pathway has recently been implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases. Recently, it was reported that chorein-depleted cells showed accumulation of autophagic markers and impaired autophagic flux. Here, we demonstrate that chorein overexpression preserves cell viability from starvation-induced cell death in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells. Subsequent coimmunoprecipitation and reverse coimmunoprecipitation assays using extracts from chorein that stably overexpressed HEK293 cells revealed that chorein interacts with α-tubulin and histone deacetylase 6, a known α-tubulin deacetylater and central component of basal autophagy. Indeed, acetylated α-tubulin immunoreactivity was significantly decreased in chorein that stably overexpressed HEK293 cells. These results suggest that chorein/histone deacetylase 6/α-tubulin interactions may play an important role in starvation-induced cell stress, and their disruption may be one of the molecular pathogenic mechanisms of chorea-acanthocytosis.-Sasaki, N., Nakamura, M., Kodama, A., Urata, Y., Shiokawa, N., Hayashi, T., Sano, A. Chorein interacts with α-tubulin and histone deacetylase 6, and overexpression preserves cell viability during nutrient deprivation in human embryonic kidney 293 cells."
https://openalex.org/W2490579618,"Background Enhancing biological resilience may offer a novel way to prevent and ameliorate disease in older patients. We investigated whether changes in C-reactive protein (CRP), as a dynamic marker of the acute inflammatory response to diverse stressors, may provide a way to operationalize the concept of resilience in older adults. We tested this hypothesis by examining whether such changes could predict prognosis by identifying which individuals are at greater risk of 6-month mortality. Methods Analysis of prospective, routinely collected datasets containing data on hospitalization, clinical chemistry and rehabilitation outcomes for rehabilitation inpatients between 1999 and 2011. Maximum CRP response during acute illness and CRP recovery indices (time and slope of CRP decay to half maximum, and to <50mg/L if peak values were greater than 50mg/L) was derived from biochemistry data. 6-month survival plots were conducted on quartiles of CRP recovery indices. Cox proportional hazards models were used to test univariate and multivariate predictors of 6-month mortality. Covariates included age, sex, number of medications, serum calcium, haemoglobin level, renal function, and the presence of previous myocardial infarction, stroke, chronic heart failure, COPD and diabetes. Results 3723 patients, mean age 84 years, were included. 1535 (41%) were male and 733 (20%) died during six-month follow-up. The lower an individual’s peak CRP reading, and the longer the time taken for their CRP to fall, the better their 6-month survival. The time for CRP to reach half of its maximum value was the best dynamic CRP index of survival (HR 0.93 per week, 95% CI 0.89 to 0.98; p = 0.004); this remained significant even after adjustment for maximum CRP level and covariates listed above. Conclusion CRP recovery indices are associated with survival in older people; further work is required to explain differences in physiology between patients with a fast and slow CRP recovery."
https://openalex.org/W2501371852,"The thermal and structural evolutions associated to active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) purity are monitored using a laboratory instrument (S3-MicroCaliX) allowing simultaneous time-resolved X-ray scattering at both wide and small angles (SWAXS) as a function of temperature. This is performed simultaneously with differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) that is carried out in the same apparatus at scanning rate of 2 K/min on the same sample in the range from 20° to 200°C. We have studied simultaneous thermal and structural properties of pentoxifylline, as an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), for its purity quality control. We have found a satisfying API purity, due to obtained melting temperature and enthalpy values, which are in a well agreement with literature. We have also found that the combination of these techniques allows the thermal monitoring of scanning rates of 2 K/min, continuously without the need for static thermal equilibration, particularly for X-ray spectra. Hence, DSC and SWAXS allowing better identification of the structural thermal events recorded by following of the phase transitions simultaneously. This interpretation is much better possible when X-ray scattering at small and wide angles is coupled with DSC from the same sample. Hence, as a laboratory tool, the method presents a reproducible thermal and crystallographic API purity quality control of non-complex samples, as crucial information for pharmaceutical technology."
https://openalex.org/W2506208588,"There is evidence that timing processes in the suprasecond scale are modulated by attentional mechanisms; in addition, some studies have shown that attentional mechanisms also affect timing in the subsecond scale. Our aim was to study eye movements and pupil diameter during a temporal bisection task in the subsecond range. Subjects were trained to discriminate anchor intervals of 200 or 800 msec, and were then confronted with intermediate durations. Eye movements revealed that subjects used different cognitive strategies during the bisection timing task. When the stimulus to be timed appeared randomly at a central or 4 peripheral positions on a screen, some subjects choose to maintain their gaze toward the central area while other followed the peripheral placement of the stimulus; some others subjects used both strategies. The time of subjective equality did not differ between subjects who employed different attentional mechanisms. However, differences emerged in the timing variance and attentional indexes (time taken to initial fixation, latency to respond, pupil dilatation and duration and number of fixations to stimulus areas). Timing in the subsecond range seems invariant despite the use of different attentional strategies. Future research should determine whether the selection of attentional mechanisms is related to particular timing tasks or instructions or whether it represents idiosyncratic cognitive ""styles""."
https://openalex.org/W2499022457,"A new imaging contrast agent is reported that provides an increased fluorescent signal upon application of ultrasound (US). Liposomes containing lipids labelled with pyrene were optically excited and the excimer fluorescence emission intensity was detected in the absence and presence of an ultrasound field using an acousto-fluorescence setup. The acousto-fluorescence dynamics of liposomes containing lipids with pyrene labelled on the fatty acid tail group (PyPC) and the head group (PyPE) were compared. An increase in excimer emission intensity following exposure to US was observed for both cases studied. The increased intensity and time constants were found to be different for the PyPC and PyPE systems, and dependent on the applied US pressure and exposure time. The greatest change in fluorescence intensity (130%) and smallest rise time constant (0.33 s) are achieved through the use of PyPC labelled liposomes. The mechanism underlying the observed increase of the excimer emission intensity in PyPC labelled liposomes is proposed to arise from the “wagging” of acyl chains which involves fast response and requires lower US pressure. This is accompanied by increased lipid lateral diffusivity at higher ultrasound pressures, a mechanism that is also active in the PyPE labelled liposomes."
