https://openalex.org/W1633747844,"The regioselectivity and stereoselectivity of androgen hydroxylations catalyzed by five isozymes of cytochrome P-450 purified from phenobarbital-induced rat liver were studied in a reconstituted monooxygenase system using testosterone (T) and androst-4-ene-3,17-dione (delta 4-A) as substrates. P-450 PB-3, an isozyme exhibiting low catalytic activity with many xenobiotic substrates, catalyzed efficient (turnover = 15.7 to 18.5 min-1 P-450-1 at 25 microM substrate) and highly stereoselective B-ring hydroxylations of both steroid substrates, with the corresponding 7 alpha- and 6 alpha-hydroxy alcohols formed in ratios of approximately 20 to 30:1, respectively. P-450 PB-2c metabolized testosterone to a mixture of 16 alpha OH-T, 2 alpha OH-T, and delta 4-A (product ratio = 1.0/0.78/0.33; turnover = 10.2 min-1 P-450-1). PB-2c is present in significantly larger amounts in mature male rats as compared to immature males, and probably catalyzes the male-specific testosterone 16 alpha-hydroxylase activity known to be induced at puberty and subject to endocrine control. P-450 PB-4, the major phenobarbital-induced isozyme in rat liver, catalyzed efficient D-ring hydroxylations, yielding 16 beta OH- delta 4-A as the predominant product with delta 4-A as substrate (turnover = 12.0 min-1 P-450-1) and a mixture of 16 beta OH-T, 16 alpha OH-T, and delta 4-A (the latter compound presumably formed via 17 alpha hydroxylation) with testosterone as substrate (turnover = 5.2 min-1 P-450-1). P-450 isozymes PB-1 and PB-5 hydroxylated both steroids with essentially the same regioselectivity as PB-4 but at only 5 to 10% the catalytic rate. Cytochrome b5 stimulated most of these steroid hydroxylations up to 2-fold with no change in regio- or stereoselectivity. The identification of specific steroid metabolites as diagnostic of particular P-450 isozymes should be useful for the assessment of isozymic contributions to microsomal activities and, in addition, facilitate comparisons of P-450 isozymes isolated in different laboratories."

In doing so, infants disregard the modality (visual or auditory) and type (object or event) of items presented. This finding indicates that infants possess a mechanism that enables them to obtain information about number."

https://openalex.org/W1495393871,"In a previous study we demonstrated that highly purified lipid-transfer protein facilitated the transfer of triglyceride, cholesteryl ester, and phosphatidylcholine between plasma lipoproteins. It remained unclear, however, whether these lipids were transferred by independent sites on the lipid-transfer protein. To address this point, we have studied the protein-mediated transfer of triglyceride, cholesteryl ester, and phosphatidylcholine as a function of the concentration and lipid composition of donor and acceptor lipoproteins. Lipoproteins labeled in vitro, reconstituted lipoproteins of defined lipid composition, and phosphatidylcholine liposomes with or without triglyceride and/or cholesteryl ester have been used to investigate the inter-relationships of lipids transferred by the lipid-transfer protein. In studies of initial (less than or equal to 10-13%) transfer, we found that, although absolute transfer rates were affected, the ratio of cholesteryl ester to triglyceride transferred was independent of donor and acceptor lipoprotein concentrations and acceptor lipoprotein lipid composition. With reconstituted lipoproteins as donor, we demonstrated that this ratio was linearly related to the ratio of cholesteryl ester to triglyceride in the donor particle; the sum of triglyceride and cholesteryl ester transferred remained constant and independent of the lipid composition of the donor. Experiments with intact lipoproteins labeled in vitro and with small unilamellar vesicles in the presence and absence of p-chloromercuriphenylsulfonate, confirmed the interdependence of triglyceride and cholesteryl ester transfer. In contrast, under all assay conditions, no correlation was found between the amount of phosphatidylcholine transferred and the transfer of triglyceride and/or cholesteryl ester. We conclude that triglyceride and cholesteryl ester compete for transfer and that the extent of transfer for each lipid is determined by its relative concentration in the donor particle, whereas phosphatidylcholine transfer is independent of triglyceride and cholesteryl ester transfer. The data also strongly support the conclusion that lipid transfer protein promotes both the exchange and net transfer of triglyceride and cholesteryl ester and that the net transfer process proceeds by a reciprocal exchange of triglyceride and cholesteryl ester without net transfer of core lipid between lipoproteins."

https://openalex.org/W1491935126,"Hemin (ferric protoporphyrin IX chloride) has been shown to cause strand scission in DNA in a reaction which requires the presence of oxygen and the reducing agent, 2-mercaptoethanol. In model studies, circular supercoiled plasmid DNA is converted within 30 min to the open circle and linear forms. With longer incubation times the DNA is degraded to small pieces. The reaction is markedly influenced by the addition of divalent cations; Mg2+ and Ca2+ inhibit the reaction while the transition metals Co2+, Zn2+, Ni2+, and Cu2+ promote the degradation. These observations are discussed in relation to the role of hemin in the modulation of gene expression during cell differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1663064741,"Abstract We have synthesized the radiolabeled diuretics [3H]bumetanide and [3H]benzmetanide (3-benzylamino-4-phenoxy-5-sulfamoylbenzoic acid) and have tested their potential as reversible labels of the Na,K,Cl co-transport system. These compounds bind with high affinity (Kd less than or equal to 30 nM, under optimal conditions) to membranes isolated from dog kidney; we found approximately 2 pmol/mg of sites in crude membranes from the outer medulla, and less than or equal to 0.5 pmol/mg in a similar preparation from kidney cortex. On sucrose gradient centrifugation, a peak of [3H]bumetanide binding activity (30 pmol/mg) is obtained at 37% (w/v) sucrose, distinct from the basolateral membranes in outer medulla and from brush borders in proximal tubule; our hypothesis is that this peak contains luminal membranes from the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle. [3H]Bumetanide is displaced from its binding sites by various unlabeled loop diuretics at concentrations that have previously been shown to inhibit co-transport. Na+, K+, and Cl- (K1/2 congruent to 2, 1, and 1 mM, respectively) are required for [3H]bumetanide binding, and Cl- inhibits at higher concentrations. We interpret these data to demonstrate that the Na,K,Cl cotransport system is the site involved in [3H]bumetanide binding in kidney membranes."
https://openalex.org/W2051232939,"Improved liquid ion-exchanger microelectrodes made possible the observation of large, rapid decreases in the concentration of extracellular calcium ions during single epileptic spikes. Moreover, in definite cortical layers the decreases regularly started shortly before the onset of each epileptic spike. In view of the prominent role played by extracellular calcium ions in neuronal processes, including transmitter release and membrane excitability, these alterations probably exert a profound influence on the cellular events underlying epileptiform activity."
https://openalex.org/W1481469889,"Treatment of cardiac or skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles with 0.1 M sodium carbonate selectively extracts both the Ca2+-binding protein calsequestrin and the two glycoproteins, while leaving the Ca2+-dependent ATPase membrane bound. Phenyl-Sepharose chromatography in the presence of ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) and high salt (0.5 M NaCl) readily fractionates these solubilized proteins into a Ca2+-elutable fraction, which contains purified calsequestrin, and a low ionic strength elutable fraction, which contains one of the two intrinsic glycoproteins. Elution of calsequestrin from phenyl-Sepharose occurs near 1 mM Ca2+. Copurifying with calsequestrin are an homologous set of high molecular weight proteins, which like calsequestrin stain blue with Stains-All. These proteins are present in trace amounts and do not correspond to any sarcoplasmic reticulum proteins previously identified. Elution of calsequestrin from phenyl-Sepharose is consistent with the Ca2+-binding protein losing its hydrophobic character in the presence of millimolar Ca2+. This behavior is converse to that observed for several calmodulin-like proteins, which are eluted from hydrophobic gels in the presence of EGTA. The high yield and purity of calsequestrin prepared by this method makes possible a unique system for studying what may be a distinct class of Ca2+-binding proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2013962328,"The forensic use of hypnosis is increasing. A hypermnesic procedure was used in an experiment that calls this practice into question. Subjects tried for a week to recall 60 previously presented pictures. They were then either hypnotized or not and encouraged to recall even more pictures. Most of the newly recalled material was incorrect, especially for highly hypnotizable subjects in the hypnosis condition. Such errors in recall can have profound implications for forensic investigations."
https://openalex.org/W1907511098,"Testosterone metabolism by cytochrome P-450 isozymes RLM3 and RLM5 in a reconstituted system and by rat liver microsomes was examined. Eleven metabolites were detected. Two of these, found in spots 2 and 4 of a thin layer plate, were only formed by the rat liver microsomes and may represent reductive metabolites of testosterone. A number of monohydroxy metabolites were conclusively identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. These include the 2-, 6 beta-, 7 alpha-, and 16 alpha-hydroxy isomers. Liver microsomes formed the 2 alpha- and 2 beta-epimers in a 1:2 ratio and both co-chromatographed with a third reduced metabolite in thin layer plate spot 4. In contrast with RLM5 about 90% of the 2-hydroxy isomer was the 2 alpha-epimer. RLM3 did not perform the 2-hydroxylation in detectable amounts. The 6 beta-isomer was a major metabolite of RLM3 and microsomes, but a minor product of metabolism by RLM5. In contrast, the 7 alpha-isomer was a minor metabolite of RLM3, was not formed by RLM5, and was a major microsomal metabolite. Hydroxylation at position 16 alpha was a major activity of RLM5 and the heterogeneous microsomal cytochromes, but with RLM3 it was a minor reaction. One new metabolite was found which appeared to be hydroxylated in the D-ring, had a mass spectrum different from both 16 alpha- and 16 beta-hydroxytestosterone, and was tentatively identified as a 15-hydroxy isomer. In agreement with the literature, androstene-3,17-dione was found to be an oxidative metabolite of testosterone by both microsomes and purified cytochrome P-450. It was a major metabolite of RLM5 but was not produced by RLM3. Studies with 18O2 and H218O conclusively show that oxidation of testosterone at C-17 does not involve transient incorporation of an oxygen atom in this position. A mechanism is suggested whereby cytochrome P-450 acts as a peroxidase in the formation of androstenedione."
https://openalex.org/W2040435777,"Intracellular recordings were obtained from inner hair cells located in the lower basal turn of the guinea pig cochlea. At low sound pressure levels the inner hair cells were highly frequency selective, producing receptor potentials only in response to sound frequencies between about 16 and 24 kilohertz. Electrical stimulation of efferent nerves in the crossed olivocochlear bundle markedly reduced these receptor potentials while causing little change in the resting membrane potential. At high sound levels, where cells responded to an increasingly wider range of sound frequencies, stimulation was less effective in reducing receptor potentials. Since the crossed olivocochlear bundle primarily innervates outer hair cells, these results support an outer hair cell contribution to the most sensitive response region of inner hair cells."
https://openalex.org/W1969438779,"Endolymphatic hydrops was induced in guinea pigs by immunizing them with native bovine type II collagen. Histopathologic changes consisted of moderate extension of the Reissner's membrane, spiral ganglion degeneration, atrophied organ of Corti, and mild atrophy of the surface epithelium in the endolymphatic duct. These findings suggest that an immune response directed against type II collagen—a type of collagen found in the membranous labyrinth, subepithelial layer of the endolymphatic duct, spiral ligament, and enchondral layer of the otic capsule—may induce endolymphatic hydrops."

https://openalex.org/W2078471151,"Two-month-old infants discriminated complex sinusoidal patterns that varied in the duration of their initial frequency transitions. Discrimination of these nonspeech sinusoidal patterns was a function of both the duration of the transitions and the total duration of the stimulus pattern. This contextual effect was observed even though the information specifying stimulus duration occurred after the transitional information. These findings parallel those observed with infants for perception of synthetic speech stimuli. Specialized speech processing capacities are thus not required to account for infants' sensitivity to contextual effects in acoustic signals, whether speech or nonspeech."

https://openalex.org/W1549817234,"The ATP-dependent proton uptake by chromaffin granule membranes, lysosomes, and synaptosomes was examined. In synaptosomes the reaction was absolutely dependent on the presence of chloride, while in chromaffin granules chloride had a profound effect and in lysosomes only a minor effect. The presence of chloride markedly increases the rate of collapse of delta pH by carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone in all three organelles. Ascorbate with phenazine methosulfate uncoupled the ATP-dependent proton uptake by chromaffin granules, but had no effect on lysosomes and synaptosomes. Proton uptake by submitochondrial particles was about 50-fold more sensitive to dicyclohexylcarbodiimide than the proton uptake by chromaffin granule membranes. Chromaffin granule membranes were treated with 2 M sodium bromide to inactivate the mitochondrial ATPase. The treatment caused a complete inhibition of the ATP-dependent proton uptake. Solubilization of these membranes by sodium cholate, followed by reconstitution by cholate dilution revealed the ATP-dependent proton uptake of the system. It is concluded that the genuine ATPase enzyme of chromaffin granules is a proton translocator."
https://openalex.org/W1667065506,"Ferritin with high and low iron content, 2000 and 790 iron atoms/molecule, was isolated from the spleens of copper-poisoned and control lambs, respectively. Differences in the iron content in vivo were reflected in the properties of the apoferritin protein shells, since the apoprotein from the low iron ferritin took up iron relatively more slowly (0.52 +/- 0.09) and released it more rapidly (1.68 +/- 0.06) in vitro. Although the two types of apoferritin were indistinguishable in terms of surface charge (pI range 4.98-5.43) and in consisting of both heavy and light subunits, the subunit interactions differed markedly; 40-50% of the subunits of low iron ferritin were in dimers stable to reduction and carboxylmethylation, 4% mercaptoethanol, 8% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and 100 degrees C for 30 min, 70% formic acid, and 30% methanol. Subunit dimers were also observed in liver ferritin from mouse and neonatal pig and were enriched in a low iron fraction of horse spleen ferritin. Based on cyanogen bromide fragmentation and NH2-terminal analysis, the natural and chemically cross-linked subunit dimers had two peptides in common; natural subunit dimers also appeared to have a second region cross-linked, suggesting the possibility of both intra- and intersubunit links in the natural dimers. In sheep spleen ferritin, both heavy and light subunits appeared to participate in subunit dimerization. Natural subunit dimers were enriched in low iron ferritin fractions of all ferritin preparations tested (linear correlation = 0.94) and can explain, at least in part, the previously observed effects of iron core size on the apoferritin shell. Whether the subunit cross-links represent part of the subunit assembly process subsequently cleaved by iron (or copper) or whether the cross-links form after iron core formation in vivo has yet to determined. In either case, it is clear that such post-translational variations can affect iron uptake and release and emphasize the importance of the protein shell in determining the iron storage properties of ferritin."

This assembly is suggestive of a gametogenic cell division in ancient predecessors of ciliates, with Tetrahymena retaining only the associated nuclear division and export."
https://openalex.org/W1535068962,"The rat uterus contains two classes of specific nuclear estrogen-binding sites which may be involved in estrogen action. Type I sites represent the classical estrogen receptor (Kd = 1 nM) and type II sites (Kd = 10-20 nM) are stimulated in the nucleus by estrogen under conditions which cause uterine hyperplasia. Dilution of uterine nuclear fractions from estrogen treated rats prior to quantitation of estrogen binding sites by [3H]estradiol exchange results in an increase (3- to 4-fold) in the measurable quantities of the type II site. Estimates of type I sites are not affected by dilution. These increases in type II sites following nuclear dilution occur independently of protein concentration and result from the dilution of a specific endogeneous inhibitor of [3H]estradiol binding to these sites. The inhibitor activity is present in cytosol preparations from rat uterus, spleen, diaphragm, skeletal muscle, and serum. Preliminary characterization of the inhibitor activity by Sephadex G-25 chromatography shows two distinct peaks which are similar in molecular weight (300). These components (alpha and beta) can be separated on LH-20 chromatography since the beta-peak component is preferentially retained on this lipophilic resin. Partial purification of the LH-20 beta inhibitor component by high performance liquid chromatography and gas-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometric analysis suggests the putative inhibitor activity is not steroidal in nature and consists of two very similar phenanthrene-like molecules (molecular weights 302 and 304). Analysis of cytosol preparations on LH-20 chromatography shows that non-neoplastic tissues (uterus, liver, lactating mammary gland) contain both and inhibitor components whereas estrogen-induced rat mammary tumors contain very low to nonmeasurable quantities of the beta-peak inhibitor activity."
https://openalex.org/W1533180394,"Hemoglobin A hybrids with carboxymethyl groups at the alpha-NH2 termini of the alpha-chains or the beta-chains or at the termini of both chains have been prepared by reductive alkylation of the protein with glyoxylate and NaCNBH3 under controlled conditions. A hemoglobin derivative, which was selectively carboxymethylated at the NH2-terminal residues, was separated into its alpha- and beta-chains. These derivatized chains were recombined to yield alpha 2 Cm beta 2 Cm or were combined with unmodified beta- or alpha-chains, respectively, and purified to yield alpha 2 Cm beta 2 or alpha 2 beta 2 Cm. These hybrid tetramers retained their cooperativity and function (average n = 2.4). The hybrid alpha 2 Cm beta 2 had a lower oxygen affinity (p50 = 12 mm) than unmodified hemoglobin (p50 = 7 mm) and was reactive with 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (p50 = 48 mm). The oxygen affinity of the derivative alpha 2 beta 2 Cm was lower (p50 = 17 mm) than unmodified hemoglobin and was affected only slightly by 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (p50 = 25 mm). The tetramer carboxymethylated at all 4 NH2-terminal residues, alpha 2 Cm beta 2 Cm, exhibited a very low intrinsic oxygen affinity (p50 = 37 mm) that was further lowered to a limiting value of 50 mm by saturating amounts of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate. Each carboxymethyl tetramer, except alpha 2 Cm beta 2 Cm, was reactive with chloride to lead to a lower oxygen affinity. These carboxymethylated hybrids (Hb-NH-CH2COO-) may provide a useful model system for studies on the binding of anions to hemoglobin or on the interaction of CO2 with hemoglobin to form the carbamate Hb-NH-COO-."
https://openalex.org/W1553004461,"Mycoplasma capricolum, a procaryotic sterol and fatty acid auxotroph was grown on media supplemented with [3H]palmitate or [3H]oleate. The isolated bacterial membranes were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Of the more than 50 membrane polypeptides revealed by Coomassie blue staining, approximately 25 were labeled with [3H]palmitate and only about 6 were labeled with [3H]oleate. Exhaustive delipidation of the membranes with chloroform:methanol did not alter the labeling pattern. Treatment of delipidated membranes by mild alkaline hydrolysis released up to 71% of the [3H]palmitate and 93% of the [3H]oleate. The data suggest that numerous membrane proteins of M. capricolum are covalently modified by acylation with saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Cerulenin, a specific inhibitor of fatty acid synthesis had no effect on the labeling of mycoplasma membrane proteins by either [3H]palmitate or [3H]oleate. A small amount of membrane-associated cholesterol previously shown to stimulate sequentially the synthesis of unsaturated phospholipid, RNA, and protein (Dahl, J. S., and Dahl, C. E. (1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 80, 692-696) specifically enhances the acylation of certain proteolipids by oleate but not by palmitate."

https://openalex.org/W1590462946,"An acid lipase was purified from rat liver lysosomes. Lipase purification involved affinity chromatography, gel filtration, and stabilization of the purified preparation using ethylene glycol and Triton X-100. A molecular weight of 67,000-69,000 was determined independently using density gradient centrifugation, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and gel filtration. To study enzyme action, model substrates were prepared by incorporating radiolabeled triolein into either unilamellar vesicles or microemulsions. Substrates were prepared by cosonicating aqueous dispersions of lecithin and triolein. Formation of vesicles or emulsions depended on the relative amount of each lipid and on sonication conditions. Vesicles were prepared at molar ratios between 70:1 and 26:1 (lecithin:triolein) and the microemulsion preparation at a molar ratio of 1:1. The substrate particles were of similar size (220-250 A) as determined by Bio-Gel A-15m chromatography. Hydrolysis of triolein contained in vesicles or emulsions was similar with respect to pH, temperature, and reaction products. Kinetic studies on vesicles with increasing triolein content showed progressively greater Vmax values (0-0.6 mumol/min/mg), and Vmax for the emulsion was 3.1 mumol/min/mg. Addition of human very low or low density lipoprotein produced a dose-dependent inhibition with both substrates. The results show that synthetically prepared microemulsions are stable and effective substrates for the acid lipase and indicate that surface-oriented triolein is hydrolyzed in both preparations."
https://openalex.org/W1988615846,"Acetylcholine receptors at innervated neuromuscular junctions are very stable, with half-lives reported to be 6 to 13 days. Their turnover is described as a first-order process, implying a single population of receptors. In this study, two subpopulations of acetylcholine receptors at normally innervated junctions have been identified. One has a rapid turnover rate with a half-life of 18.7 hours, similar to that of extrajunctional receptors, and the other has a slow turnover rate with a half-life of 12.4 days. The rapidly turned over subpopulation represents approximately 20 percent of the total junctional receptors. This finding may account for the discrepancies in previous reports of turnover rates and may explain the rapid reversibility in vivo of agents that ""irreversibly"" block acetylcholine receptors. This finding also implies that the synthesis rate of junctional acetylcholine receptors may be higher than previous estimates. The rapidly turned-over subpopulation may represent receptors that were newly inserted into the neuromuscular junction and that were not yet stabilized by an influence of the motor nerve."

It is becoming more widely available as an approach for overcoming sterility in married couples and appears also to be gaining social acceptance in that context. Several technical options presented by the procedure, particularly storage of frozen embryos and embryo transfers involving third-party contributions, are less fully evaluated clinically and raise social, ethical, and legal questions that go beyond the original medical model for therapeutic intervention. The clinical success of in vitro fertilization and the options it affords call for careful policy consideration.

In view of the sensitivity of patients with primary open-angle glaucoma to the effects of glucocorticoids in raising intraocular pressure, this potentiation may be responsible for the steroid sensitivity and for the ocular hypertension seen in this disorder."
https://openalex.org/W1524186496,"Calf aortic smooth muscle cell cultures produce both type III and type I collagen. Polyadenylated mRNA species purified from these cells direct the synthesis of prepro-alpha 1(III), prepro-alpha 1(I), and prepro-alpha 2(I) in a rabbit reticulocyte cell-free system. These polypeptides were identified by specific immunoprecipitation, cyanogen bromide peptide mapping, and bacterial collagenase digestion. Lower molecular weight collagenase susceptible polypeptides were also produced in translation reactions incubated under conditions optimized for incorporation of radiolabeled amino acids. Their presence did not appear to result from ribonuclease or protease involvement or from premature termination. Increasing the Mg2+ concentration in the translation system significantly reduced the production of these lower molecular weight species. Pulse-chase experiments indicate that the time required for completion of full length preprocollagen at the high Mg2+ concentration is greatly decreased compared to the low concentration. Additional experiments suggest that the incomplete collagen polypeptides result from pausing of ribosome movement during elongation. The relative synthesis of type III and type I chains was examined as a function of mRNA concentration in the cell-free system. At levels of RNA above saturation, the relative production of type III decreased with respect to type I. These data suggest that the ability of the alpha 1(III) mRNA to initiate translation is less efficient than the mRNAs of alpha 1(I) and alpha 2(I)."
https://openalex.org/W1544426816,"The location of histone H5 on nucleosomes has been determined by binding anti-H5 antibodies to dinucleosomes, and recording the position of the bound IgG molecules using electron microscopy. Two types of antibody were employed, a total IgG fraction prepared from rabbits immunized with H5/RNA, which reacted to all three domains (NH2-terminal, central globular, and COOH-terminal) of H5, and an immunospecific subfraction which bound only to the central globular peptide. After reacting with dinucleosomes, both types of antibody were localized primarily in the linker DNA entry/exit region, but the whole antibody showed a much greater affinity for the linker DNA itself than did the antiglobular peptide antibody. These results provide direct support for the concept that H5, and by inference H1, is located at the linker DNA entry/exit site of the nucleosome, and further suggest that it is the central globular portion of the molecule that is most closely associated with this site. An interaction of one or both termini of H5 with the linker DNA is also indicated."

https://openalex.org/W1502457570,"We have compared the oxidative renaturation of reduced hen egg white lysozyme promoted by Cu(II) + O2 with that promoted by a glutathione redox buffer. The progress curves for protein fluorescence, circular dicroism, thiol oxidation, hydrodynamic volume, and enzymic activity were determined for both regeneration systems. All of these processes were more rapid in the glutathione regeneration than in the copper-catalyzed. Comparison of the two systems was carried out by normalizing the progress curves with a coordinate system where time is replaced by extent of protein thiol oxidation. While similar progress curves were obtained for circular dichroism, the two systems produced distinctly different progress curves for enzymic activity, fluorescence, and gel permeation chromatographic reflection of protein hydrodynamic volume. We infer that all these differences result from differences in relative amounts and/or kind of reaction intermediates. Thus, there are substantial differences between the renaturation mechanisms of the glutathione- and the copper-promoted systems."
https://openalex.org/W2127318161,"The inhibition of chicken liver phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase by 3-mercaptopicolinic acid (3-MP) has been investigated. Kinetic studies show 3-MP to be a noncompetitive inhibitor relative to all substrates and to the activator, Mn2+. EPR studies demonstrate that Mn2+ binding to the enzyme is unaffected by 3-MP. Proton relaxation rate studies demonstrate that 3-MP binds to the binary E X Mn complex with a KD of 0.5 X 10(-6) M and gives a ternary enhancement of 8.0. Additional proton relaxation rate studies detected formation of the quaternary complexes E X Mn X IDP X 3-MP, E X Mn X ITP X 3-MP, and E X Mn X CO2 X 3-MP. High resolution 1H nuclear relaxation rate studies suggest that 3-MP binds in close proximity to the activator cation, Mn2+, but not in the first coordination sphere. Active site models suggest that the 3-MP-binding site may partially overlap the phosphoenolpyruvate-binding site. The NMR studies, which detected formation of the quaternary E X Mn X 3-MP X phosphoenolpyruvate complex, also demonstrated that the binding of one of these ligands affects the interactions of the other ligand with E X Mn. Calorimetric studies of the E X Mn complex demonstrated that 3-MP causes an increase in the transition temperature midpoint without an increase in enthalpy. These results indicate that 3-MP causes a conformational change in the enzyme but does not increase the thermostability of the ternary complex. The experiments reported herein suggest that inhibition by 3-MP is due to specific and reversible binding within the active site of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase."

The shortened enzyme derivative gives one band (Mr = 95,000) on polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis. Changes in protein conformation induced by tryptic digestion were studied by fluorescence spectroscopy. The native enzyme tagged with the chromophore fluorescein yields a rotational relaxation time of 106 ns, whereas the trypsin-digested enzyme gives a rotational relaxation time of 33 ns. The decrease in rotational relaxation time is attributed to flexibility of the polypeptide chain with enhanced rotational freedom of the probe covalently linked to one thiol group. The reactivity of sulfhydryl groups toward 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) is also affected by trypsin cleavage. More--SH groups (2.6/dimer) become reactive toward 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) as a result of trypsin digestion. Local conformational fluctuations are induced as a result of tryptic cleavage, but the catalytic sites remain intact. The peptides released from 4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase were characterized by fingerprint analysis and their amino acid composition determined."
https://openalex.org/W1585539177,"The effects of membrane sterol level on the susceptibility of LM cell plasma membranes to exogenous phospholipases A2 has been investigated. Isolated plasma membranes, containing normal or decreased sterol content, were prepared from mutant LM cell sterol auxotrophs. beta-Bungarotoxin-catalyzed hydrolysis of both endogenous phospholipids and phospholipids introduced into the membranes with beef liver phospholipid exchange proteins was monitored. In both cases, phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) were degraded at similar rates in normal membranes, while PC hydrolysis was specifically accelerated in sterol-depleted membranes. Additional data suggest that this preferential hydrolysis of PC is not a consequence of the phospholipid head group specificity of the phospholipase, nor of a difference in the accessibility of PC versus PE to the enzyme. Analysis of the reaction products formed during treatment of isolated membranes with phospholipase A2 showed almost no accumulation of lysophospholipids. This was found to be due to highly active lysophospholipase(s), present in LM cell plasma membranes, acting on the lysophospholipids formed by phospholipase A2 action. A soluble phospholipase A2 was partially purified from LM cells and found to behave as beta-bungarotoxin with regard to membrane sterol content. These results demonstrate that the nature of phospholipid hydrolysis, catalyzed by phospholipase A2, can be significantly affected by membrane lipid composition."
https://openalex.org/W1484550878,"Cytosol estrogen receptor (ERc) and nuclear estrogen receptor (ERN) levels were investigated in rat uteri under different conditions of hormonal exposure. The amount of directly assayable receptor was closely related to the serum concentration of 17 beta-[2,4,6,7-3H] estradiol ( [3H]E2). A double injection technique was established to maintain serum levels of [3H]E2 which were sufficient to saturate receptor sites. Under these conditions, stable ERC and ERN levels are maintained throughout the study period. 30% of the total ER remains cytoplasmic in localization despite continuous hormonal exposure. Properties of ERC and ERN after 6 h of continuous hormonal exposure were investigated and found to be different from receptors found in these subcellular compartments 30 min after hormone injections. ERC from uteri 30 min after injection showed a faster sedimentation coefficient than ERC prepared 6 h after hormone treatment. ERC after 6 h of hormonal exposure showed a reduction of binding to calf thymus DNA adsorbed on cellulose in a cell-free system. ERC 30 min after [3H]E2 treatment had a biphasic dissociation pattern consistent with two different receptor populations, whereas uterine ERC obtained after 6 h of in vivo exposure to estradiol showed virtually no dissociation at 22 and 28 degrees C. In contrast to ERC, ERN 6 h after hormone injection sedimented faster than ERN obtained 30 min after treatment. KCl extractable ERN obtained either at 30 min or 6 h posthormone treatment showed biphasic dissociation kinetics at 22 and 28 degrees C, whereas KCl nonextractable ERN showed virtually no dissociation. Virtually all of the specifically bound ligand in cytosol and nuclear preparations was proven to be authentic E2. We conclude that total cellular receptor is quantitatively conserved during 6 h of continuous hormonal treatment. Nuclear receptor loss is not a requisite for receptor-mediated steroid function, although important time-dependent changes in receptor properties in both cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments do occur."

https://openalex.org/W1546940155,"Biochemical properties of cytosol estrogen receptor (ERC) and nuclear estrogen receptor (ERN) from rat uteri continuously exposed in vivo to 17 beta-[2,4,6,7-3H] estradiol ( [3H]E2) for 6 h have been studied on the basis of immunological recognition and chromatographic elution patterns. Overall concentrations of ERC and ERN did not change during this time period when receptor-saturating concentrations of [3H]E2 were maintained (Jakesz, R., Kasid, A., and Lippman, M. E. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 11798-11806); however, biochemical characteristics were different in ERC and ERN after short or long term hormonal exposure. When ERC from rats treated with estradiol for 30 min was applied to HAP or DEAE columns, two different ER binding components were seen. DNA binding in a cell-free system revealed that these binding components represented an activated and a nonactivated ERC population. After long term hormonal exposure (6 h), only one component of ERC with low DNA binding could be shown despite the preservation of an equivalent quantity of cytoplasmic binding activity. This binder does not react with a monoclonal antibody directed against extranuclear estrogen receptor species. These data suggest disappearance of the activated ERC population, with appearance of a new, immunologically nonrecognizable ERC species with 6 h of continuous hormonal exposure. Elution profiles of ERN on HAP chromatography reveal 2 different binding components at 30 min and at 6 h of continuous [3H]E2 exposure. There is an increase of the population eluted at higher molarity after 6 h of in vivo treatment. This later eluting binding component is the major DNA binder in vitro. ERN from both time points are recognized immunologically by monoclonal antibody. After reaction with the antibody, the sedimentation coefficient shifted to 8-9 S on sucrose gradients, but the previously described faster sedimentation of ERN extracted 6 h after injection persisted. We conclude that ER in both cellular compartments undergoes time-dependent alterations, which may be involved in the initiation of hormone action."
