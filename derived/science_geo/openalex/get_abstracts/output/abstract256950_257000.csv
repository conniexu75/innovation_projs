https://openalex.org/W2011068062,"Investigations aimed at identifying regulators of nuclear architecture in Drosophila demonstrated that cells lacking H3K9 methylation and RNA interference (RNAi) pathway components displayed disorganized nucleoli, ribosomal DNA (rDNA) and satellite DNAs. The levels of H3K9 dimethylation (H3K9me2) in chromatin associated with repeated DNAs decreased dramatically in Su(var)3-9 and dcr-2 (dicer-2) mutant tissues compared with wild type. We also observed a substantial increase in extrachromosomal circular (ecc) repeated DNAs in mutant tissues. The disorganized nucleolus phenotype depends on the presence of Ligase 4 and ecc DNA formation is not induced by removal of cohesin. We conclude that the structural integrity and organization of repeated DNAs and nucleoli are regulated by the H3K9 methylation and RNAi pathways, and other regulators of heterochromatin-mediated silencing. In addition, repeated DNA stability involves suppression of non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or other recombination pathways. These results suggest a mechanism for how local chromatin structure can regulate genome stability, and the organization of chromosomal elements and nuclear organelles."

https://openalex.org/W2050166692,"Although inherently linked, body form and body action may be represented in separate neural substrates. Using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in healthy individuals, we show that interference with the extrastriate body area impairs the discrimination of bodily forms, and interference with the ventral premotor cortex impairs the discrimination of bodily actions. This double dissociation suggests that whereas extrastriate body area mainly processes actors' body identity, premotor cortex is crucial for visual discriminations of actions."

https://openalex.org/W2036512457,"One goal in sequencing the Plasmodium falciparum genome, the agent of the most lethal form of malaria, is to discover vaccine and drug targets1. However, identifying those targets in a genome in which ∼60% of genes have unknown functions is an enormous challenge. Because the majority of known malaria antigens and drug-resistant genes are highly polymorphic and under various selective pressures2,3,4,5,6, genome-wide analysis for signatures of selection may lead to discovery of new vaccine and drug candidates. Here we surveyed 3,539 P. falciparum genes (∼65% of the predicted genes) for polymorphisms and identified various highly polymorphic loci and genes, some of which encode new antigens that we confirmed using human immune sera. Our collections of genome-wide SNPs (∼65% nonsynonymous) and polymorphic microsatellites and indels provide a high-resolution map (one marker per ∼4 kb) for mapping parasite traits and studying parasite populations. In addition, we report new antigens, providing urgently needed vaccine candidates for disease control."

Previous studies have shown that the EC50 of Nox5 for calcium is relatively high and raises the question of whether Nox5 can be sufficiently activated in cells that do not experience extreme elevations of intracellular calcium. In the current study, we have identified a novel mechanism governing the activity of Nox5. Exposure of cells expressing Nox5 to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) resulted in a slow and sustained increase in ROS, which was markedly different from the rapid response to ionomycin. PMA greatly potentiated the activity of Nox5 in response to low concentrations of ionomycin. The ability of PMA to increase Nox5 activity was abolished by calcium chelation and was a direct effect on enzyme activity, since PMA increased the calcium sensitivity of Nox5 in a cell-free assay. PMA stimulated the time-dependent phosphorylation of Nox5 on Thr494 and Ser498. Mutation of these residues to alanine abolished both PMA-dependent phosphorylation and calcium sensitization. Conversely, mutation of Thr494 and Ser498 to glutamic acid produced a gain of function mutant that had increased activity at low concentrations of ionomycin. Within the cell, Nox5 was detected in detergent-resistant microdomains of the endoplasmic reticulum. In summary, the phosphorylation of Nox5 at key residues facilitates enzyme activation at lower levels of intracellular calcium and may provide an avenue for enzyme activation in response to a greater variety of extracellular stimuli.

The NADPH oxidases or Noxs define a unique family of enzymes that exist to synthesize reactive oxygen species (ROS) 2The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; RLU, relative light units; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; WT, wild type; GFP, green fluorescent protein; RFP, red fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; PKC, protein kinase C; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; CIP, calf intestinal phosphatase; DPI, diphenyleneiodonium; SOD, superoxide dismutase. (1Lambeth J.D. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (2468) Google Scholar). Currently, five distinct Noxs have been identified and are numbered Nox1 to -5. Of these, Nox2 is the best characterized and is expressed primarily by cells of the immune system, including neutrophils and macrophages. Mutation of Nox2 or targeted disruption in mice results in impaired host defense (2Babior B.M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2004; 16: 42-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). The biological functions of Noxs that are expressed in cells outside of the immune system are emerging but remain somewhat enigmatic. However, the considerable diversity that exists in the location, the capacity, and the mechanisms by which these enzymes are activated suggests that they have indeed evolved distinct functional roles. The mechanisms that control the synthesis of ROS by the various Nox isoforms are remarkable in their complexity. Nox2 is a transmembrane glycoprotein that is activated by the coordinated assembly of at least five distinct subunits. In unstimulated cells, Nox2 is bound to the protein p22phox, and upon activation, the coalescence of p67phox, p47phox, p40phox, and Rac yields a functional, superoxide-generating oxidase (1Lambeth J.D. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (2468) Google Scholar, 3Sumimoto H. Miyano K. Takeya R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 338: 677-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Nox1 is also bound to p22phox and is activated by the subunits NOXA1 and NOXO1, which are functionally related to p67phox and p47phox, respectively (4Banfi B. Clark R.A. Steger K. Krause K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3510-3513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 5Takeya R. Ueno N. Kami K. Taura M. Kohjima M. Izaki T. Nunoi H. Sumimoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25234-25246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The activity of Nox3 can be regulated by p22phox, p67phox, p47phox/p67phox, or NOXO1, but compared with Nox2, it is less discriminating in which subunits are required for full activation (6Cheng G. Ritsick D. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34250-34255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 7Banfi B. Malgrange B. Knisz J. Steger K. Dubois-Dauphin M. Krause K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46065-46072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). The activity of Nox4 is largely constitutive, but it is at least in part dependent on the co-association of p22phox for full activity (8Kawahara T. Ritsick D. Cheng G. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31859-31869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 9Ambasta R.K. Kumar P. Griendling K.K. Schmidt H.H. Busse R. Brandes R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45935-45941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). In contrast, Nox5 is a calcium-dependent enzyme and does not depend on the assembly of other proteins, including p22phox, for its activity (8Kawahara T. Ritsick D. Cheng G. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31859-31869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 10Banfi B. Molnar G. Maturana A. Steger K. Hegedus B. Demaurex N. Krause K.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 18583-18591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Nox5, like the other Nox isoforms, is a membrane-bound oxidase that spans the membrane six times (10Banfi B. Molnar G. Maturana A. Steger K. Hegedus B. Demaurex N. Krause K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37594-37601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). However, Nox5 is distinct in that its N terminus contains four EF hands that bind calcium and regulate its activity. In a cell-free system, the activity of membrane-bound Nox5 was shown to be entirely dependent on calcium. The addition of cytosol or cytosolic proteins that can activate Nox2 in cell-free assays did not increase the activity of Nox5 (11Banfi B. Tirone F. Durussel I. Knisz J. Moskwa P. Molnar G.Z. Krause K.H. Cox J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18583-18591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The amino terminus of Nox5 operates in a manner analogous to calmodulin, whereby calcium binding initiates a conformational change in the enzyme. This permits the interaction of the N terminus of Nox5 with a yet to be identified C-terminal domain, which then facilitates electron delivery and the production of reactive oxygen species (11Banfi B. Tirone F. Durussel I. Knisz J. Moskwa P. Molnar G.Z. Krause K.H. Cox J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18583-18591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). In cell-free assays, the EC50 for calcium was determined to be ∼1 μm, which is relatively high and unlikely to be achieved in most cells outside of extraordinary circumstances (11Banfi B. Tirone F. Durussel I. Knisz J. Moskwa P. Molnar G.Z. Krause K.H. Cox J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18583-18591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). In the context of the above model of Nox5 activation, the current study identifies a novel mechanism regulating the activity of Nox5 and provides a more physiological context for enzyme activation at lower levels of intracellular calcium. Cell Culture and Transfection—COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen) containing l-glutamine, penicillin, streptomycin, and 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. Cells were transfected with Lipofectamine™ 2000 according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen). Measurement of Reactive Oxygen Species—COS-7 cells were transfected with cDNAs encoding Nox5 or control plasmids (GFP, RFP, or LacZ), and 24 h later, cells were replated into white tissue culture-treated 96-well plates (ThermoLabsystems) at a density of ∼5 × 104 cells/well. The cells were incubated at 37 °C in phenol-free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Sigma) containing a 400 μm concentration of the luminol analogue L-012 (Wako) for a minimum of 20 min prior to the addition of agonists (12Daiber A. August M. Baldus S. Wendt M. Oelze M. Sydow K. Kleschyov A.L. Munzel T. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2004; 36: 101-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Luminescence was quantified over time using a Lumistar Galaxy (BMG) luminometer. The specificity of L-012 for reactive oxygen species was confirmed by transfecting cells with a control plasmid, such as GFP or LacZ or by co-incubation of a superoxide scavenger, such as TIRON (5 mm). Both of these interventions yielded virtually undetectable levels of luminescence under control or PMA- or ionomycin-stimulated conditions. Thus, the relative light units (RLU) quantified from the luminescence of L-012 are reflective of changes in the activity of Nox5. In additional experiments, the activity of Nox5 was also verified using a commercially available kit that is specific for superoxide (Diogenes; National Diagnostics). DNA Constructs—Nox5β (accession number AF325189) was subcloned into a modified pcDNA3 containing an N-terminal HA epitope, and sequence was verified by the Genomics Core Facility of the Medical College of Georgia. GFP- and RFP-tagged Nox5 were generated similarly and subcloned into pcDNA3 expression plasmids as previously described (13Jagnandan D. Sessa W.C. Fulton D. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: C1024-C1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). endoplasmic reticulum-RFP (DSRED) and tubulin-EGFP were obtained from Clontech. RFP-nucleus, Golgi-RFP, MITO-RFP, and PM-RFP have been described elsewhere (13Jagnandan D. Sessa W.C. Fulton D. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: C1024-C1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 14Zhang Q. Church J.E. Jagnandan D. Catravas J.D. Sessa W.C. Fulton D. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2006; 26: 1015-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). A phospho-null Nox5 construct encoding the S486A, S490A, T494A, and S498A mutations was generated by PCR using WT Nox5 cDNA as a template and the following primers: forward, 5′-GCT AAG AGG CTG GCC AGG AGT GTG GCA ATG AGA AAG GCT CAA AGG TCG TCC AAG GGC-3′; reverse, 5′-AGC CTT TCT CAT TGC CAC ACT CCT GGC CAG CCT CTT AGC ACC ACG GCC CAG TGG GTC-3′. Individual mutants were generated with the following primers: S486A (5′-gacccactgggccgtggtGctaagaggctgtcgag-3′), S490A (5′-ggttctaagaggctgGcCaggagtgtgacaatgag-3′), T494A (5′-gctgtcgaggagtgtgGcaatgagaaagagtcaaag-3′), and S498A (5′-gtgtgacaatgagaaagGCtcaaaggtcgtccaagg-3′). Combination mutants were generated with the following primers: S490A/T494A (5′-ggttctaagaggctgGcgaggagtgtgGcaatgagaaagag-3′), T494A/S498A (5′-gctgtcgaggagtgtgGcaatgagaaagGCtcaaaggtcgtccaagg-3′), S490A/S498A (5′-GGTTCTAAGAGGCTGGCGAGGAGTGTGACAATGAGAAAGGCTCAAAGGTCGTCCAAGG-3′), S490A/T494A/S498A (5′-GGCTGGCGAGGAGTGTGGCAATGAGAAAGGCTCAA-3′). Gain of function mutant (T494E/S498E) was generated by 5′-GTCGAGGAGTGTGGAAATGAGAAAGGAGCAAAGGTCGTCCAAGGGCTCTG-3′. DNA sequences were confirmed by automated sequencing. Ca2+ Measurements Using Fluo-3—COS-7 cells were incubated with a loading solution consisting of HEPES-buffered saline (HBS; 135 mm NaCl, 5.9 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 11.6 mm HEPES, and 11.5 mm glucose, pH 7.3) supplemented with 2 μm fluo-3/AM, 0.02% pluronic F-127, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 30 min and then incubated in the loading solution without Fluo-3 for 30 min to allow de-esterification of the probe. Loading solution was then replaced with HBS, and cells were placed in a fluorometer (Fluostar) and subjected to the appropriate treatment protocols. Fluorescence intensity (F) was converted into intracellular [Ca2+] by using the equation, [Ca2+](nm)=Kd(F−FminFmax−F) (Eq. 1) where Fmax was the fluorescence intensity in the presence of 0.1% Triton X-100 and 2 mm CaCl2, Fmin was the fluorescence intensity in the presence on 0.1% Triton X-100 and 1 mm EGTA, and Kd was the dissociation constant for Fluo-3 (390 nm) (15Church J.E. Fulton D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1477-1488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Live Cell Imaging—COS-7 cells were transfected with cDNAs encoding fusion proteins of EGFP and monomeric RFP (16Campbell R.E. Tour O. Palmer A.E. Steinbach P.A. Baird G.S. Zacharias D.A. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7877-7882Crossref PubMed Scopus (2009) Google Scholar) as described above. 24–48 h later, cells were replated onto glass-bottomed dishes (Matek). All imaging was performed using the LSM 510 Meta 3.2 confocal microscope (Zeiss) (Cell Imaging Core, Medical College of Georgia). Magnification power was set at ×40 with oil. Rhodamine phalloidin was obtained from Molecular Probes/Invitrogen. Immunoblotting—Cell lysates were size-fractionated by SDS-PAGE as described previously (17Fulton D. Gratton J.P. McCabe T.J. Fontana J. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Franke T.F. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Nature. 1999; 399: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (2232) Google Scholar) and immunoblotted with antibodies to HA (Roche Applied Science); phosphorylated PKC substrate (Cell Signaling), which recognizes the motif (R/K)XS*X(R/K) where X represents any amino acid and S* is phosphoserine); hsp90; PTP1B; Vimentin; and poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase (BD Biosciences). Phosphorylation state-specific antibodies to Thr494 and Ser498 were generated by Pacific Immunology using the following epitopes (threonine 494, C-SKRLSRSVT*MRSKQRS; serine 498, C-LSRSVTMRKS*QRSSKGS). Antibodies were affinity-purified by negative selection (dephosphopeptide column) and positive selection (phosphopeptide column). The specificity of these antibodies was determined against the full-length Nox5 protein as shown in Fig. 10, B and C. Subcellular Fractionation—The relative subcellular location of Nox5 was determined using the subcellular proteome extraction kit (Calbiochem). Confluent 100-mm dishes of COS-7 cells transfected with Nox5 were exposed to PMA (100 nm), α-PMA, or ionomycin and separated into cytosol, membrane, nucleus, and cytoskeleton fractions according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, adherent cells were washed with ice-cold wash buffer and then sequentially extracted using a combination of four extraction buffers. Each fraction recovered was then immunoblotted with antibodies against cytosolic, membrane, nuclear, and cytoskeleton proteins to verify the procedure. To determine the detergent solubility of Nox5, cells were lysed in a buffer (pH 7.5, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% deoxycholic acid, and 1% Triton), sonicated (6 × 1-s bursts on level 5), and separated by centrifugation (20,000 × g for 10 min) into soluble and insoluble fractions. Cell-free Activity Assays—COS-7 cells expressing Nox5 were lysed in a MOPS (30 mm, pH 7.2)-based buffer containing KCl (100 mm), Triton (0.3%), and protease inhibitors (Sigma). Adherent cells were rocked gently, and the lysis buffer was aspirated and then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (4 °C). Remaining cytoskeletal fractions were resuspended in the above MOPS buffer containing 0.3 mm EGTA to remove any residual calcium. These fractions were sonicated at low power and spun down at 14,000 rpm (4 °C). The supernatant was then aspirated, and the pellet was resuspended in MOPS buffer with mild sonication. The cell-free extract was aliquoted into buffers containing L012 (400 μm), 1 mm MgCl2, 100 μm FAD (Sigma), and buffered free calcium ranging from 0 to 26 μm (Invitrogen/Molecular Probes calcium calibration buffer kit). In select experiments, 50 units of calf intestinal phosphatase (CIP) (New England Biolabs) or glycerol (vehicle control, 5 μl) were added and incubated at 25 °C for 1 h prior to the addition of calcium. After a brief period of equilibration, reduced NADPH (Sigma) was injected to a final concentration of 200 μm, and the production of reactive oxygen species was monitored over time. LY379196 was a generous gift from Lilly. Statistical Analysis—Luminescence data are expressed as mean ± S.E. All analyses were performed using GraphPad InStat software (GraphPad Software, Inc.) and were made using a two-tailed Student’s t test or analysis of variance with a post hoc test where appropriate. Differences were considered as significant at p < 0.05 (*). Activation of Nox5 by Distinct Mechanisms—As shown previously, the activity of Nox5 can be acutely regulated by elevating intracellular calcium. In Fig. 1A, the addition of ionomycin triggers a rapid increase in the production of ROS compared with cells treated with vehicle. In the presence of the flavoprotein inhibitor, diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), and the superoxide scavengers, SOD and TIRON, this signal is eliminated, indicating that it derives from a Nox (Fig. 1B). However, as shown in Fig. 1C, the addition of β-PMA induces a slow and sustained production of ROS that is evident over 1 h. The inactive structural analogue of β-PMA, α-PMA, did not stimulate ROS production. Furthermore, DPI, SOD, and TIRON all abolished PMA-dependent ROS production, confirming Nox as the source of ROS (Fig. 1D). A direct comparison of cells expressing Nox5 versus a control cDNA, GFP, revealed that all of the ROS produced in response to both PMA and ionomycin derives from Nox5 (Fig. 1E). Preexposure of PMA Potentiates Calcium-dependent Nox5 Activity—To investigate the interrelationship, if any, between the activation of Nox5 with ionomycin versus PMA, COS-7 cells expressing Nox5 were challenged with PMA prior to the addition of different concentrations of ionomycin. As shown in Fig. 2A, the addition of a relatively low concentration of ionomycin (400 nm) stimulates a small net increase in Nox5 activity of ∼20 × 103 ± 4 × 103 RLU. The preexposure of PMA increases base-line ROS-dependent luminescence from 16 × 103 to 80–90 × 103, but interestingly, PMA potentiated the low dose ionomycin (400 nm) response to a net of 67 × 103 ± 7 × 103 RLU, or 3.5-fold higher than in the absence of PMA (p < 0.05). With higher concentrations of ionomycin (1.4 μm), there is a much more robust increase in net Nox5 activity of ∼132 × 103 ± 5 × 103 RLU (Fig. 2B). Preincubation with PMA increased base-line Nox5 activity to equivalent levels as shown in Fig. 2A, but the net ionomycin stimulation in excess of the PMA response was 139 × 103 ± 4 × 103 and not significantly different from that in the absence of PMA. Even more striking was the ability of PMA to potentiate the duration of Nox5 activation as estimated from the area under the curve above base line following ionomycin stimulation. In response to the low dose of ionomycin, the area under the curve in the presence of PMA was 16-fold greater compared with control cells (using the elevated PMA level as base line). For the higher dose of ionomycin, this difference was less apparent and only 3-fold greater in the PMA-treated group. Activation of Nox5 by PMA Is Direct and Dependent on Intra- and Extracellular Calcium—COS-7 cells expressing Nox5 were pretreated with EGTA (2 mm) or 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid acetoxymethyl ester (10 μm) and stimulated with ionomycin (1 μm) or PMA (100 nm). As shown in Fig. 3A, intracellular and extracellular calcium are both required for full activation of Nox5 in response to ionomycin. Chelation of intracellular calcium reduced the maximum activity of Nox5 and delayed the kinetics of activation. Removal of extracellular calcium did not affect the speed of activation but reduced maximum activity. The combination of the two chelators completely abrogated activity. The response to PMA was completely calcium-dependent, since chelation of either intracellular or extracellular calcium virtually abolished Nox5 activity (Fig. 3B). To exclude the possibility that PMA is elevating intracellular calcium and secondarily activating Nox5, we next measured the level of intracellular calcium using the fluorescent intracellular calcium probe, Fluo-3. As shown in Fig. 3C, PMA does not modify the resting level of intracellular calcium or the increase in response to ionomycin as shown by the measurement of calcium over time. In addition, the net increase in intracellular calcium in response to lower concentrations of ionomycin (100 nm) was not affected by PMA (data not shown). To identify whether PMA was inducing a direct change in Nox5 activity, we next performed activity assays in cell-free conditions. As shown in Fig. 4, A–F, Nox5 isolated from PMA-treated cells exhibited an increase in calcium sensitivity compared with vehicle-treated cells. With sufficient calcium, the activity of control and PMA-treated Nox5 was equivalent (Fig. 4F). To evaluate whether phosphorylation was responsible for the change in calcium sensitivity, cell extracts were pretreated with CIP to dephosphorylate Nox5. As shown in Fig. 4G, CIP reduced the calcium sensitivity of Nox5, demonstrating that phosphorylation is required for the calcium sensitization. The cell-free assay was specific for Nox5 activity, since there was no ROS production in COS-7 cells expressing only a control plasmid and also since ROS production in cells expressing Nox5 was attenuated by DPI, SOD, and TIRON (Fig. 4H). The relative increasein calcium-dependent activity in cells exposed to PMA versus vehicle is shown in Fig. 4I (p < 0.05). Nox5 Is Present in the Cytoskeletal Fraction and Is Phosphorylated by PMA—COS-7 cells expressing Nox5 were separated into cytosolic, membrane, nuclear, and cytoskeletal fractions. As shown in Fig. 5A, Nox5 is present primarily in the cytoskeletal fraction, with a small amount detected in the membrane fraction. The validity of our fractionation methodology was confirmed by the presence of hsp90α in the cytosol, PTP-1B in membranes, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase in the nucleus, and vimentin in the cytoskeletal fraction (Fig. 5A). To confirm that Nox5 was present in the detergent-insoluble fraction, cells were lysed in a 1% Triton buffer and separated via centrifugation into equal volume soluble and insoluble fractions. As shown in Fig. 5B, virtually all of the Nox5 was present in the detergent-insoluble fraction. Thus, the detergent-resistant nature of Nox5 and its presence in the cytoskeletal fraction precluded us from using immunoprecipitation to isolate Nox5 from other proteins and determine its phosphorylation state. Instead, we exploited this subcellular fractionation technique to partially purify Nox5 in the cytoskeletal fraction and thus determine its phosphorylation state using an anti-PKC substrate antibody. Fig. 5C demonstrates that upon stimulation with PMA, but not α-PMA or ionomycin, Nox5 is robustly phosphorylated. Notably, in COS-7 cells transfected with a control plasmid, GFP, there was no detectable signal in this fraction at the same molecular weight as Nox5. To correlate phosphorylation with ROS generation, we directly compared the activity of Nox5 (Fig. 5D) with its phosphorylation state (Fig. 5E). Exposure of cells to PMA induced the time-dependent phosphorylation of Nox5, which was maximal between 40 and 60 min and matched precisely the time-dependent increase in Nox5 activity. The Phosphorylation of Nox5 on Specific Residues Regulates Its Activity—Our next goal was to identify putative Nox5 phosphorylation sites. Using motif scanning for PKC substrates, based on the consensus motif of RXS/TXR and the program DIPHOS, a cluster of potential PKC phosphorylation sites was identified at Ser486, Ser490, Thr494, and Ser498 (Fig. 6A). Site-directed mutagenesis of these phosphorylation sites completely abolished both basal phosphorylation and the ability of PMA to induce phosphorylation (Fig. 6B). To address the functional ramifications of these phosphorylation sites, COS-7 cells were transfected with WT Nox5 and mutant Nox5 in which Ser486, Ser490, Thr494, and Ser498 were mutated to the nonphosphorylatable analogue, alanine. As shown in Fig. 6C, the ability of PMA to stimulate Nox5 activity was greatly attenuated in the phospho-null mutant compared with WT. To address potential negative consequences on overall Nox5 activity, we next examined the ability of high doses of ionomycin to stimulate the calcium-dependent activation. There was no significant difference in the ability of ionomycin to stimulate ROS production from WT and mutant Nox5 (Fig. 6D). This finding demonstrates that the deletion of the PMA-dependent phosphorylation sites selectively reduces ROS generation in response to PMA but does not reduce Nox5 activity per se. Mutation of PMA-dependent Phosphorylation Sites Inhibits Calcium Sensitization—Nox5-transfected COS-7 cells were pretreated with PMA or vehicle and then stimulated with different concentrations of ionomycin. Low concentrations of ionomycin (0.2 μm) evoked a very small increase in ROS production that was greatly potentiated by pretreatment with PMA (Fig. 7A). This potentiation was greatly reduced in cells expressing the Nox5 phospho-null mutant, where the response to ionomycin was equivalent to that of the WT Nox5 in the absence of PMA. PMA also significantly prolonged the duration of increased WT Nox5 activity as evident in Fig. 7, A and B. As the concentration of ionomycin increased (Fig. 7, B–D), the effect of PMA diminished. With sufficient ionomycin concentration, the difference between all groups was normalized, demonstrating that the capacity of Nox5 to produce ROS was equivalent, given sufficient calcium. Identification and Functional Relevance of Specific Nox5 Phosphorylation Sites—To identify the specific sites involved, we individually mutated each of the putative phosphorylation sites and compared the activity to WT. As shown in Fig. 8A, the activity of the S486A mutant was equivalent to that of WT, but mutation of Ser490, Thr494, and Ser498 all produced modest inhibition ranging from 25 to 35% (Fig. 8, B–D). We next addressed whether more than one phosphorylation site was required for full activity. In Fig. 9, A and B, COS-7 cells were transfected with WT and S490A/T494A, T494A/S498A, and S490A/S498A double mutants and simulated with PMA. All double mutants produced substantially greater inhibition than the single mutants, with the T494A/S498A combination the most effective. The triple mutant (S490A/T494A/S498A) also produced substantial inhibition of PMA-stimulated activity (Fig. 9E). Again, to exclude the possibility that these mutations have spurious effects on the activity of Nox5, we examined the response to high concentrations of ionomycin. As shown in Fig. 9, B, D, and F, the response to ionomycin was not significantly reduced compared with WT.FIGURE 9Phosphorylation of more than one phosphorylation site is required for full Nox5 activity in response to PMA.

Although amyloid formation is traditionally associated with diseases such as Alzheimer disease, a number of biologically functional amyloids have recently been described. Curli are amyloid fibers produced by Escherichia coli that contribute to biofilm formation and other important physiological processes. We characterized the polymerization properties of the major curli subunit protein CsgA. CsgA polymerizes into an amyloid fiber in a sigmoidal kinetic fashion with a distinct lag, growth, and stationary phase. Adding sonicated preformed CsgA fibers to the polymerization reaction can significantly shorten the duration of the lag phase. We also demonstrate that the conversion of soluble CsgA into an insoluble fiber involves the transient formation of an intermediate similar to that characterized for several disease-associated amyloids. The CsgA core amyloid domain can be divided into five repeating units that share sequence and structural hallmarks. We show that peptides representing three of these repeating units are amyloidogenic in vitro. Although the defining characteristics of CsgA polymerization appear conserved with disease-associated amyloids, these proteins evolved in diverse systems and for different purposes. Therefore, amyloidogenesis appears to be an innate protein folding pathway that can be capitalized on to fulfill normal physiological tasks.

Therefore, amyloidogenesis appears to be an innate protein folding pathway that can be capitalized on to fulfill normal physiological tasks. Amyloid formation is the hallmark of medically related disorders such as Alzheimer disease, Huntington disease, Parkinson disease, and the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (1Chiti F. Dobson C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 333-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (5130) Google Scholar). The root of these diseases is the uncontrolled conversion of seemingly unrelated soluble proteins into biochemically and structurally related fibers known as amyloids. Despite their diversity in size and amino acid content, all amyloid proteins assemble into 4–12-nm-wide fibers that are β-sheet-rich and exhibit conserved tinctorial properties. Soluble preamyloid species also share common pore-like epitopes, and these globular species may induce cytotoxicity (2Hardy J. Selkoe D.J. Science. 2002; 297: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (11002) Google Scholar, 3Kayed R. Head E. Thompson J.L. McIntire T.M. Milton S.C. Cotman C.W. Glabe C.G.

Numerous studies have revealed that amyloidogenic proteins are mostly unstructured or contain mixtures of β-sheets and α-helices in their native state, but when polymerized into fibers, they invariably adopt a characteristic cross β-sheet structure (5Barrow C.J. Zagorski M.G. Science. 1991; 253: 179-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar, 6Barrow C.J. Yasuda A. Kenny P.T. Zagorski M.G. J. Mol.

This cross β-sheet structure is common to all amyloids and is characterized by β-strands that orient perpendicular to the fiber axis. In vitro, disease-associated amyloids polymerize into fibers with nucleation-dependent kinetics with characteristic lag, growth, and stationary phase. The lag phase is proposed to contain folding intermediates that are key to the toxicity associated with certain amyloidogenic proteins (8Lashuel H.A. Hartley D. Petre B.M. Walz T. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Nature. 2002; 418: 291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1128) Google Scholar, 9Lesne S. Koh M.T. Kotilinek L. Kayed R. Glabe C.G. Yang A. Gallagher M. Ashe K.H. Nature. 2006; 440: 352-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2427) Google Scholar). During the lag phase, amyloidogenic proteins adopt a transient folding species that disrupts membrane integrity (3Kayed R.

A new class of amyloids has recently been found that plays important physiological roles for the cell. These so-called “functional” amyloids are found in bacteria (11Bieler S. Estrada L. Lagos R.

Koulov A.V. Alory-Jost C. Marks M.S. Balch W.E. Kelly J.W. PLoS Biol. 2005; 4: e6Crossref Scopus (682) Google Scholar). The first example of a functional amyloid in bacteria was curli (12Chapman M.R.

Curli compose part of the complex extracellular matrix that is required for biofilm formation (17Austin J.W. Sanders G. Kay W.W. Collinson S.K. FEMS Microbiol.

An intriguing question is whether these functional amyloid proteins polymerize in a manner similar to disease-associated amyloids. Curli formation is the result of an elegant biosynthetic pathway directed by the Csg proteins in Escherichia coli. The major curli subunit, CsgA, can be secreted to the cell surface as a soluble, unstructured protein (12Chapman M.R. Robinson L.S. Pinkner J.S. Roth R. Heuser J. Hammar M. Normark S. Hultgren S.J. Science. 2002; 295: 851-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar, 26Barnhart M.M. Chapman M.R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 131-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). CsgA is efficiently nucleated into an insoluble amyloid fiber in the presence of the outer membrane-associated protein, CsgB (27Hammar M. Bian Z. Normark S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6562-6566Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). After nucleation, the fibers are predicted to grow by subsequent CsgA addition to the tip of the amyloid fiber (26Barnhart M.M. Chapman M.R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 131-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). Both CsgA and CsgB display a remarkable five-fold internal symmetry characterized by conserved polar residues. These five “repeating units” consist of 19–24 amino acids and align along serine, glutamine, and asparagine residues (26Barnhart M.M. Chapman M.R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 131-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar, 28Collinson S.K. Parker J.M. Hodges R.S. Kay W.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 741-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Each repeating unit is predicted to form a strand-loop-strand motif that closely resembles the cross β-spine structure described for many disease-associated amyloids (28Collinson S.K. Parker J.M. Hodges R.S. Kay W.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 741-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 29Nelson R. Eisenberg D. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2006; 16: 260-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 30Nelson R. Sawaya M.R. Balbirnie M. Madsen A.O. Riekel C. Grothe R. Eisenberg D. Nature. 2005; 435: 773-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (1823) Google Scholar). Here we characterize the folding of purified CsgA and show that its polymerization is similar to that of disease-associated amyloids. CsgA polymerization involves a transient structurally conserved intermediate that implies a common polymerization pathway between functional and disease-associated amyloids. We found that the conserved folding intermediate for CsgA is a monomer or low molecular weight multimer. We demonstrate that at least three of five repeating units of CsgA are amyloidogenic. These results suggest that covalent linkage of multiple amyloidogenic units facilitates efficient fiber formation. CsgA Purification—CsgG and CsgA-His were overexpressed in LSR12 (C600::Δcsg) as described previously (12Chapman M.R. Robinson L.S. Pinkner J.S. Roth R. Heuser J. Hammar M. Normark S. Hultgren S.J. Science. 2002; 295: 851-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar). Following centrifugation for 15 min at 10,000 × g, the supernatant was clarified by filtration through a 0.22-μm polyethersulfone bottle-top filter (Corning, Acton, MA). Filtrates containing CsgA were passed over a HIS-Select™ HF nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Sigma) column, washed with 10 volumes of 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer (KPi), 2The abbreviations used are: KPi, potassium phosphate buffer; ThT, thioflavin T; GdnHCl, guanidine hydrochloride; R, repeating unit; TEM, transmission electron microscopy; Aβ, amyloid β. pH 7.2, and eluted with 10 mm KPi 100 mm imidazole, pH 7.2. CsgA-containing fractions were combined and passed through a 0.02-μm Anotop 10 filter (Whatman, Maidstone, UK). The N-terminal portion of purified CsgA-His was sequenced by mass spectrometry and found to be identical to the predicted CsgA amino acid sequence. A modified protocol using guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) was employed to fully denature CsgA-His. Following the first wash, the column was equilibrated with 5 volumes of 10 mm KPi, 8 m GdnHCl, pH 7.2, and eluted with 50 mm KPi, 8 m GdnHCl, pH 2. Sephadex G25 was used for desalting/buffer exchange. To create CsgA-His seeds, 2-week-old fibers were sonicated using a Fisher Model 100 sonic dismembrator (Fisher) for three 15-s bursts on ice. Where indicated, CsgA samples were filtered through a prewashed Amicon Ultra-4 (Millipore, Bedford, MA) centrifugal filter device. Samples were centrifuged at 4,000× g for 2 min, and the retentate and filtrate fractions were collected. A plasmid encoding CsgA-His can complement ΔcsgA cells in vivo, and purified CsgA-His polymerizes into an amyloid fiber with similar kinetics as wild-type CsgA (12Chapman M.R. Robinson L.S. Pinkner J.S. Roth R. Heuser J. Hammar M. Normark S. Hultgren S.J. Science. 2002; 295: 851-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar). Therefore, CsgA-His is referred to as “CsgA” throughout this report. Thioflavin T (ThT) Assay—Following desalting to remove imidazole or GdnHCl, CsgA was incubated at room temperature. At different time intervals, CsgA samples were mixed with 20 μm ThT, and fluorescence was measured using a Spectramax M2 plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) set to 438 nm excitation and 495 nm emission with a 475 nm cutoff. Alternatively, samples amended with 25 μm ThT were assayed directly in the Spectramax M2 plate reader every 10 min after shaking for 5 s. CD Spectroscopy—CsgA samples (10 μm CsgA in 50 mm KPi, pH 7.2) were assayed in a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter from 190 to 250 nm in a quartz cell with a 1-mm path length at 25 °C. Blot Assay with A11 and Anti-CsgA—CsgA samples were dripped onto 0.2-μm Transblot nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) as described (3Kayed R. Head E. Thompson J.L. McIntire T.M. Milton S.C. Cotman C.W. Glabe C.G. Science. 2003; 300: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (3446) Google Scholar) and allowed to dry for 5 min. The membrane was blocked in 5% milk in TBS-T (Tris-buffered saline with 0.01% Tween 20) for at least 1 h. The dot blots were washed three times in TBS-T before and after incubating with 1:10,000 dilutions of A11 primary antibody (BioSource, Camarillo, CA) and goat anti-rabbit-horseradish peroxidase (Sigma) in 3% bovine serum albumin/TBS-T. The blots were developed using the SuperSignal® West Dura system (Pierce). Blots were stripped and reprobed with a 1:10,000 dilution of rabbit anti-CsgA antibody (31Barnhart M.M. Lynem J. Chapman M.R. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 5212-5219Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Electron Microscopy—Philips CM12 Scanning Transmission Electron Microscope was used to visualize the fiber aggregates. Samples (10 μl) were placed on Formvar-coated copper grids (Ernest F. Fullam, Inc., Latham, NY) for 2 min, washed with deionized water, and negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate for 90 s. Peptide Preparation—Peptides were chemically synthesized by Proteintech Group Inc., Chicago, IL. Purity was greater than 90% by high pressure liquid chromatography, and size was confirmed by mass spectroscopy. To equilibrate the pH of each sample and to remove any potential seed in the peptide preparations, the peptides were denatured using a modified protocol described previously (32Chen S. Wetzel R. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 887-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Briefly, peptides were dissolved to 0.5 mg/ml in trifluoroacetic acid/hexafluoroisopropanol (1:1 v/v) and sonicated for 10 min. The suspensions were incubated at room temperature until they visibly cleared. The solvent was then removed by vacuum. Peptides were then dissolved in cold 2 mm HCl and centrifuged at 100,000 × g in a TLA-55 (Beckman Coulter) for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatants were equilibrated to 50 mm KPi, pH 7.2, by 200 mm KPi, pH 7.2, on ice. When the samples were shifted to room temperature, the polymerization was measured by ThT. CsgA Polymerization Kinetics—To determine the polymerization kinetics of CsgA, an in vitro polymerization assay was developed. The transition of freshly purified, soluble CsgA to amyloid fibers was monitored using ThT, an amyloid-specific dye commonly used to assay amyloid formation (33LeVine H. II I Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 404-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1950) Google Scholar, 34LeVine H. II I Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 274-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1208) Google Scholar). The ThT fluorescence of CsgA samples followed a sigmoidal curve with distinguishable lag, growth, and stationary phases (Fig. 1A). The length of the lag phase was concentration-independent when CsgA was incubated at concentrations above 4 μm (Fig. 1A). Concentration-independent lag phases have been reported for other amyloidogenic proteins (35Lomakin A. Teplow D.B. Kirschner D.A. Benedek G.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7942-7947Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 36Rhoades E. Gafni A. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 3480-3487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). ThT fluorescence signal did not appreciably change after 8 h, remaining at approximately the same level for over 30 days (data not shown). Circular dichroism spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to measure the structural changes that occurred during CsgA amyloidogenesis. Circular dichroism spectrum indicated that immediately after purification, CsgA was largely unstructured (Fig. 1B). However, CsgA adopted a β-sheet-rich structure after 2 days of incubation at room temperature (Fig. 1B). Immediately after purification, there was no apparent fiber formation or aggregation by TEM (Fig. 1C). Two hours after purification, regular, unbranched fibers were readily observed (Fig. 1D). Dense fiber aggregates were also observed 7 days after purification (Fig. 1E). The A11 Antibody Recognizes a Transient CsgA Folding Species—The polymerization of eukaryotic amyloids involves the formation of an intermediate folding species proposed to cause amyloid-associated toxicity to host cells (2Hardy J. Selkoe D.J. Science. 2002; 297: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (11002) Google Scholar, 3Kayed R. Head E. Thompson J.L. McIntire T.M. Milton S.C. Cotman C.W. Glabe C.G. Science. 2003; 300: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (3446) Google Scholar). The A11 antibody recognizes an Aβ transient intermediate (3Kayed R. Head E. Thompson J.L. McIntire T.M. Milton S.C. Cotman C.W. Glabe C.G. Science. 2003; 300: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (3446) Google Scholar). Remarkably, this antibody also recognizes a transient intermediate formed by islet amyloid polypeptide, polyglutamine, prion peptide 106–126, and Sup35p, among others (3Kayed R. Head E. Thompson J.L. McIntire T.M. Milton S.C. Cotman C.W. Glabe C.G. Science. 2003; 300: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (3446) Google Scholar, 37Shorter J. Lindquist S. Science. 2004; 304: 1793-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). The A11 antibody recognizes only a transient intermediate species, not soluble monomers or mature amyloid fibers derived from these proteins. The A11 antibody was used to determine whether CsgA shared a common polymerization intermediate with eukaryotic amyloids. We found that immediately after purification, CsgA was recognized by the A11 antibody (Fig. 2A). As fiber formation proceeded, evidenced by increased ThT fluorescence and the appearance of fiber aggregates by TEM, the A11 antibody lost its affinity for CsgA (Fig. 2A). A polyclonal antibody generated against CsgA recognized purified CsgA independent of its polymerization status (Fig. 2A). The observation that the A11 antibody recognized CsgA suggested that CsgA polymerization intermediates might be structurally similar to those formed by disease-associated amyloid proteins. It also suggested that immediately after purification, CsgA had already begun its transition to an amyloid fiber. To prevent CsgA from folding during purification, the CsgA-containing fractions were amended with 8 m GdnHCl. Under these strongly denaturing conditions, the A11 antibody did not recognize CsgA; however, denatured CsgA was strongly recognized by the CsgA antibody (Fig. 2B). Immediately after GdnHCl removal with a desalting column, CsgA was recognized by the A11 antibody (Fig. 2B). To determine the minimum size of the CsgA transient intermediate, freshly purified protein was passed through Amicon Ultra centrifugal membranes with different molecular weight cutoffs. The retentate and filtrate were probed with the A11 antibody (Fig. 2C). The A11 antibody recognized a species in the filtrate of the 30-kDa membrane, suggesting that the smallest reactive species of CsgA is 30 kDa or less. Because CsgA-His has a predicted molecular mass of 13.9 kDa, the species recognized by the A11 antibody is likely either a monomer or a dimer. CsgA Fibers Can Catalyze Self-polymerization—The approximately sigmoidal ThT fluorescence curve suggests that CsgA polymerizes in a nucleation-dependent mechanism. Therefore, the growing fiber would be expected to direct the polymerization of new CsgA molecules. We tested the hypothesis that preformed CsgA fibers could catalyze CsgA polymerization. The addition of 2.5% (w/w) sonicated CsgA fibers to freshly purified, soluble CsgA resulted in a significant reduction of the lag phase (Fig. 3A). Coincident with the dramatically shorter lag phase in seeded reactions, CsgA was recognized by the A11 antibody for a significantly shorter time when compared with unseeded reactions (Fig. 3B). CsgA Is Composed of Several Amyloid-forming Units—The observation that CsgA was recognized by the A11 antibody immediately after passing through a 30-kDa cutoff filter (Fig. 2C) was unexpected since the A11 antibody is thought to recognize an oligomeric form of amyloidogenic proteins (3Kayed R. Head E. Thompson J.L. McIntire T.M. Milton S.C. Cotman C.W. Glabe C.G. Science. 2003; 300: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (3446) Google Scholar, 9Lesne S. Koh M.T. Kotilinek L. Kayed R. Glabe C.G. Yang A. Gallagher M. Ashe K.H. Nature. 2006; 440: 352-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2427) Google Scholar, 37Shorter J. Lindquist S. Science. 2004; 304: 1793-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). The number of molecules present in the oligomeric state recognized by A11 varies among amyloidogenic proteins, and Aβ oligomers have been estimated to be larger than tetramers (3Kayed R. Head E. Thompson J.L. McIntire T.M. Milton S.C. Cotman C.W. Glabe C.G. Science. 2003; 300: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (3446) Google Scholar, 9Lesne S. Koh M.T. Kotilinek L. Kayed R. Glabe C.G. Yang A. Gallagher M. Ashe K.H. Nature. 2006; 440: 352-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2427) Google Scholar). However, CsgA is recognized by A11 as a monomer or at most a dimer as estimated by cutoff filtration. It is possible that a single CsgA molecule includes multiple amyloidogenic domains that collectively contribute to its interaction with the A11 antibody. The primary sequence of CsgA can be divided into three parts: the Sec-dependent signal sequence, the N-terminal 22 amino acids of the mature protein, and a repeat domain that contains five 19–22-amino-acid repeating units (Fig. 4A). The five repeating units form a protease-resistant structure that is proposed to be the amyloid core of CsgA (26Barnhart M.M. Chapman M.R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 131-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar, 28Collinson S.K. Parker J.M. Hodges R.S. Kay W.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 741-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Each repeat has four conserved polar amino acids: serine, glutamine, asparagine, and glutamine (Fig. 4A). The regular arrangement of glutamine and asparagine residues also occurs in CsgA homologs from different Enterobacteriaceae. 3X. Wang and M. R. Chapman, unpublished observation. We hypothesized that these repeating units might represent single amyloid-forming units. Peptides corresponding to each repeating unit were chemically synthesized and tested for their ability to form amyloid fibers. Two independently derived preparations of each peptide were assayed. Peptides corresponding to repeating unit 1, 3 or 5 (R1, R3, or R5) produced a ThT-positive signal and self-assembled into fibers as evidenced by TEM when incubated at 0.2 mg/ml (Fig. 4, B–E). Neither R2 nor R4 showed evidence of amyloidogenesis when resuspended at a concentration of 0.2 mg/ml, although fibers were observed by TEM when R2 or R4 was incubated at 2 mg/ml (Fig. 4B and data not shown). The morphology of R1 fibers was similar to that of those formed by purified CsgA, being generally longer than 1000 nm (compare Fig. 4C with Fig. 1, D and E). R3 fibers were consistently shorter (ranging from 200 to 1000 nm) than those formed by CsgA (compare Fig. 4D with Fig. 1, D and E). R5 fibers appeared more rigid and aggregated than CsgA fibers (Fig. 4E). The morphologies of the fibers did not appreciably change over the course of a 10-day incubation. This analysis suggests that CsgA contains at least three highly amyloidogenic domains, R1, R3, and R5, that likely drive fiber formation in vivo. Amyloid formation is traditionally associated with uncontrolled protein misfolding and aggregation that results in many systemic and neurodegenerative disorders (1Chiti F. Dobson C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 333-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (5130) Google Scholar, 38Shorter J. Lindquist S. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2005; 6: 435-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). However, there are a growing number of functional amyloids that suggest amyloidogenesis is also a general tenet of normal cellular physiology. In fact, amyloid formation may be a common property of most proteins (39Fandrich M. Fletcher M.A. Dobson C.M. Nature. 2001; 410: 165-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar, 40Guijarro J.I. Sunde M. Jones J.A. Campbell I.D. Dobson C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4224-4228Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). The work presented here, as well as that published previously, demonstrates that both disease-associated and functional amyloids share a common amyloid formation pathway (41Glover J.R. Kowal A.S. Schirmer E.C. Patino M.M. Liu J.J. Lindquist S. Cell. 1997; 89: 811-819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). CsgA polymerizes with nucleation-dependent kinetics, and fiber formation is ameliorated by the addition of preformed CsgA fibers. We also found that CsgA polymerization involves the formation of a transient species similar to that produced by other amyloidogenic proteins such as Aβ, synuclein, islet amyloid polypeptide, insulin, lysozyme, and polyglutamine (3Kayed R. Head E. Thompson J.L. McIntire T.M. Milton S.C. Cotman C.W. Glabe C.G. Science. 2003; 300: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (3446) Google Scholar). The transient species that the A11 antibody recognizes during CsgA polymerization is a monomer or low molecular weight multimer (Fig. 2C). It was reported that the A11-recognized species of Aβ and Sup35p were probably large molecular weight oligomers (3Kayed R. Head E. Thompson J.L. McIntire T.M. Milton S.C. Cotman C.W. Glabe C.G. Science. 2003; 300: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (3446) Google Scholar, 37Shorter J. Lindquist S. Science. 2004; 304: 1793-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Unlike Aβ and Sup35p (3Kayed R. Head E. Thompson J.L. McIntire T.M. Milton S.C. Cotman C.W. Glabe C.G. Science. 2003; 300: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (3446) Google Scholar, 37Shorter J. Lindquist S. Science. 2004; 304: 1793-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), CsgA was immediately recognized by the A11 antibody upon removal of strong denaturants such as GdnHCl or after its passage through a 30-kDa Amicon filter. We also found that freshly purified CsgA heated to 95 °C for 5 min was recognized by the A11 (data not shown). At least two hypotheses can be proposed to explain the ability of CsgA to be recognized by A11 immediately after denaturation or passage through a 30-kDa cutoff filter. First, CsgA may adopt an oligomeric conformation so quickly that our ability to measure this transition is lost in the time that it takes to immobilize CsgA on the blotting paper. Another possibility is that the CsgA species recognized by A11 is not an oligomer, but a monomer that contains multiple amyloidogenic units. In support of this hypothesis, we show that CsgA does indeed contain at least three amyloidogenic domains. Nevertheless, these two hypotheses are not mutually exclusive, and there may be other plausible interpretations. Nonetheless, CsgA contains multiple amyloidogenic domains that may contribute to its ability to efficiently transition from a soluble protein to an amyloid fiber. Many studies have led to the proposal that amyloid fibers themselves are not toxic to cells; instead, toxicity is proposed to be caused by transient folding intermediates (2Hardy J. Selkoe D.J. Science. 2002; 297: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (11002) Google Scholar, 42Demuro A. Mina E. Kayed R. Milton S.C. Parker I. Glabe C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17294-17300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar, 43Glabe C.G. Kayed R. Neurology. 2006; 66: S74-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Therefore, one mechanism that might be used by functional amyloids to prevent toxicity is to minimize the duration of toxic folding intermediates. This is apparently how Pmel17, an extremely rapidly forming functional amyloid found in mammalian cells, is able to assemble within the cell without eliciting a toxicity cascade (16Fowler D.M. Koulov A.V. Alory-Jost C. Marks M.S. Balch W.E. Kelly J.W. PLoS Biol. 2005; 4: e6Crossref Scopus (682) Google Scholar). CsgA has a striking primary sequence arrangement (Fig. 4A). The five repeats of CsgA are very similar and share greater than 30% sequence identity. We showed that each repeating unit is potentially a single amyloid domain and that R1, R3, and R5 are the highly amyloidogenic in vitro (Fig. 4, B–E). The covalent linkage of multiple amyloid domains may facilitate amyloid fiber formation by increasing the number of amyloidogenic building blocks. This also results in rapid formation of the intermediate recognized by the A11 antibody. Other amyloidogenic proteins contain repeat sequences that have been postulated to facilitate fiber formation (44Ross E.D. Minton A. Wickner R.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 1039-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 45Wright C.F. Teichmann S.A. Clarke J. Dobson C.M. Nature. 2005; 438: 878-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). For instance, the N-terminal prion-determining domain of Sup35p has five imperfect oligopeptide repeats, and certain deletions of the repeats are defective in propagation of Sup35p fibrils. Moreover, in vitro, repeat expansion peptides (with two extra repeats) were shown to be more amyloidogenic than wild-type peptides (46Liu J.J. Lindquist S. Nature. 1999; 400: 573-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Previous work suggested that the most amyloidogenic domains of CsgA were contained in the hexapeptide GHGGGN and QFGGGN, which are present in R2 and R4, respectively (47Cherny I. Rockah L. Levy-Nissenbaum O. Gophna U. Ron E.Z. Gazit E. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 352: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, our analysis suggests that R1, R3, and R5 contain the more highly amyloidogenic sequences. A thorough mutagenesis study is needed to define the residues that contribute to the highly amyloidogenic nature of CsgA. The amyloidogenic peptides R1 and R5 contain sequences that contribute significantly to the ability of CsgA to bind human proteins such as fibronectin, plasminogen, tissue plasminogen activator, and β2-microglobulin (48Olsen A. Herwald H. Wikstrom M. Persson K. Mattsson E. Bjorck L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34568-34572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This correlation suggests that the amyloidogenecity of CsgA may be directly linked to these biological activities. In fact, work by Gebbink et al. (49Gebbink M.F. Claessen D. Bouma B. Dijkhuizen L. Wosten H.A. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 3: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) suggested that curli contribute to colonization in animal hosts by activating host proteases that are involved in hemostasis. Curli can also enhance amyloid protein A amyloidosis in mice (50Lundmark K. Westermark G.T. Olsen A. Westermark P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 6098-6102Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). It is proposed that cross-seeding may play a role in the development of amyloid diseases (50Lundmark K. Westermark G.T. Olsen A. Westermark P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 6098-6102Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 51Kisilevsky R. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 130: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The in vitro system that we have established here provides an ideal vehicle to test the specificity of curli seeding with other amyloids. Understanding how functional amyloid proteins interact with other host proteins may lead to new ideas about cellular physiology and the processes that promote the toxicity associated with many amyloids. Most amyloids are known to self-propagate in a process called seeding. In prion diseases such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy, seeding underlies protein infectivity (52Prusiner S.B. Brain Pathol. 1998; 8: 499-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Amyloid self-propagation is also critical to disease development in the non-transmissible amyloid diseases (51Kisilevsky R. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 130: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 53Lansbury Jr., P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3342-3344Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Our demonstration of CsgA seeding suggests that functional amyloids also utilize a controlled self-propagation process to fulfill their biological function. In vivo CsgA polymerization is nucleated by the outer membrane-associated protein CsgB, which shares nearly 49% sequence similarity with CsgA (27Hammar M. Bian Z. Normark S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6562-6566Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). One proposed model of nucleation is that CsgB provides an amyloid-like template that initiates CsgA polymerization (26Barnhart M.M. Chapman M.R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 131-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar, 27Hammar M. Bian Z. Normark S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6562-6566Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The growing fiber tip could then act as a template to direct subsequent CsgA polymerization. Proteins that are not predicted to form stable globular folds may be prone to aggregation and amyloid formation, and indeed, most functional amyloid proteins have natively disordered segments (29Nelson R. Eisenberg D. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2006; 16: 260-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 54Uversky V.N. Gillespie J.R. Fink A.L. Proteins. 2000; 41: 415-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1770) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, some proteins have been shown to form amyloid fibers only after the native, globular fold has been compromised by chemical denaturants or by mutations (39Fandrich M. Fletcher M.A. Dobson C.M. Nature. 2001; 410: 165-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar, 40Guijarro J.I. Sunde M. Jones J.A. Campbell I.D. Dobson C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4224-4228Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar, 55Booth D.R. Sunde M. Bellotti V. Robinson C.V. Hutchinson W.L. Fraser P.E. Hawkins P.N. Dobson C.M. Radford S.E. Blake C.C. Pepys M.B. Nature. 1997; 385: 787-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar). The circular dichroism studies presented here suggest that CsgA is unstructured after secretion (Fig. 1B). Mature CsgA is also predicted to be natively unfolded (data not shown) by the Uversky and Galzitskaya algorithms (54Uversky V.N. Gillespie J.R. Fink A.L. Proteins. 2000; 41: 415-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1770) Google Scholar, 56Galzitskaya O.V. Garbuzynskiy S.O. Proteins. 2006; 63: 144-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The natively unfolded segments of CsgA may facilitate amyloidogenesis indirectly by preventing formation of stable globular structures that would be less likely to aggregate and precipitate into a fiber. Alternatively, the unfolded regions of CsgA may actively direct amyloidogenesis by presenting specific aggregative surfaces to neighboring molecules. In this context, “natively unfolded” would be a transition state during the formation of a stably folded amyloid fiber. Importantly, in the case of functional amyloids, the amyloid fiber would not be the product of protein misfolding but that of protein folding. Certainly, the growing number of functional amyloids suggests that amyloid is an evolutionarily conserved structure. The selective processes that have been employed by functional amyloids to limit cellular toxicity provide a unique context from which to investigate disease-associated amyloidogenesis.

https://openalex.org/W1990578192,"Serial analysis of gene expression followed by pathway analysis implicated the tight junction protein claudin-1 (CLDN1) in melanoma progression. Tight junction proteins regulate the paracellular transport of molecules, but staining of a tissue microarray revealed that claudin-1 was overexpressed in melanoma, and aberrantly expressed in the cytoplasm of malignant cells, suggesting a role other than transport. Indeed, melanoma cells in culture demonstrate no tight junction function. It has been shown that protein kinase C (PKC) can affect expression of claudin-1 in rat choroid plexus cells, and we observed a correlation between levels of activated PKC and claudin expression in our melanoma cells. To determine if PKC could affect the expression of CLDN1 in human melanoma, cells lacking endogenous claudin-1 were treated with 200 nM phorbol myristic acid (PMA). PKC activation by PMA caused an increase in CLDN1 transcription in 30 min, and an increase in claudin-1 protein by 12 h. Inhibition of PKC signaling in cells with high claudin-1 expression resulted in decreased claudin-1 expression. CLDN1 appears to contribute to melanoma cell invasion, as transient transfection of melanoma cells with CLDN1 increased metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) secretion and activation, and subsequently, motility of melanoma cells as demonstrated by wound-healing assays. Conversely, knockdown of CLDN1 by siRNA resulted in the inhibition of motility, as well as decreases in MMP-2 secretion and activation. These data implicate claudin-1 in melanoma progression."

https://openalex.org/W2093510891,"The contribution of the insulin-like growth-factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) to tumour progression is well documented. To identify new mediators of IGF-IR function in cancer, we recently isolated genes differentially expressed in cells overexpressing the IGF-IR. Among these was the serine/threonine kinase PBK/TOPK (PDZ-binding kinase/T-LAK cell-originated protein kinase), previously associated with highly proliferative cells and tissues. Here, we show that PBK is expressed at high levels in tumour cell lines compared with non-transformed cells. IGF-I could induce PBK expression only in transformed cells, whereas epidermal growth factor could induce PBK in non-transformed MCF-10A breast epithelial cells. Suppression of PBK expression using small interfering RNA did not prevent progression through the cell cycle, but caused decreased proliferation over time in culture, and reduced clonogenic growth in soft agarose. PBK knockdown impaired p38 activation after long-term stimulation with different growth factors and reduced DU145 cells motility. Suppressed PBK expression also resulted in an impaired response to DNA damage that was evident by the decreased generation of gamma-H2AX, increased DNA damage and decreased cell survival. Taken together, the data indicate that PBK is necessary for appropriate activation and function of the p38 pathway by growth factors. Thus, enhanced expression of PBK may facilitate tumour growth by mediating p38 activation and by helping cells to overcome DNA damage."
https://openalex.org/W2050010024,"Transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) is a potent trophic factor for midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons, but its in vivo function and signaling mechanisms are not entirely understood. We show that the transcriptional cofactor homeodomain interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2) is required for the TGFβ-mediated survival of mouse DA neurons. The targeted deletion of Hipk2 has no deleterious effect on the neurogenesis of DA neurons, but leads to a selective loss of these neurons that is due to increased apoptosis during programmed cell death. As a consequence, Hipk2−/− mutants show an array of psychomotor abnormalities. The function of HIPK2 depends on its interaction with receptor-regulated Smads to activate TGFβ target genes. In support of this notion, DA neurons from Hipk2−/− mutants fail to survive in the presence of TGFβ3 and Tgfβ3−/− mutants show DA neuron abnormalities similar to those seen in Hipk2−/− mutants. These data underscore the importance of the TGFβ-Smad-HIPK2 pathway in the survival of DA neurons and its potential as a therapeutic target for promoting DA neuron survival during neurodegeneration."

For the CPD photolyase, the initial step in the proposed repair mechanism (13.Jordan S.P. Jorns M.S. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8915-8923Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) is a photoinduced electron transfer from the fully reduced FAD cofactor (FADH-) to the CPD, resulting in the formation of a CPD anion radical and a neutral FADH· radical. The cyclobutane ring of the unstable CPD radical opens, and subsequently the electron is transferred back to the FADH· radical, thus restoring the initial redox states of both the FAD and the pair of pyrimidine bases in the DNA. Thus the entire process represents a true catalytic cycle with net-zero exchanged electrons. Unlike CPD photolyase, (6-4) photolyases are not able to directly restore the original bases from the (6-4) photoproduct in UV-damaged DNA; rather, following binding of the lesion, the overall repair reaction consists of two distinct steps, one of which is light-independent and the other one light-dependent (Fig. 1) (14.Kim S.-T.

This intermediate spontaneously rearranges to form an oxetane intermediate by intramolecular nucleophilic attack. Such a mechanism requires that one histidine acts as a proton acceptor and the other as a proton donor (see Fig. 2), which implies that the two histidines should have markedly different pKa values. However, until now it has not been established which histidine acts as an acid and which one functions as a base. The proposed reaction mechanism is based on a biochemical study using alanine-substituted mutants (16.Hitomi K. Nakamura H. Kim S.-T. Mizukoshi T. Ishikawa T. Iwai S. Todo T. J. Biol.

R′ and R″ are either CH3 in thymine or H in uracil.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the subsequent light-driven reaction, one electron is believed to be transferred from the fully reduced FAD cofactor (FADH-) to the oxetane intermediate thus forming a neutral FADH· radical and an anionic oxetane radical, which spontaneously fractures. The excess electron is then back-transferred to the flavin radical restoring the fully reduced flavin cofactor and a pair of pyrimidine bases (see Fig. 1). When the FAD cofactor is not in its catalytically active (fully reduced) redox state, another photoreaction takes place both in CPD photolyase and (6-4) photolyase (17.Heelis P.F. Okamura T.

In this so-called photoactivation (also called flavin-cofactor photoreduction), photolyases undergo reversible electron transfer reactions via amino acid residues to stepwise reduce their flavin cofactors to FADH- (for recent reviews see Refs 5.Weber S.

Therefore, the characterization of FADH· leads to a better understanding of the individual steps of enzymatic DNA repair and furthermore is of considerable interest for comparative analyses of other flavoenzymes (23.Kay C.W.M.

Hyperexpression strains of Escherichia coli can generate large amounts of recombinant bacterial CPD photolyase in a catalytically inactive form characterized by intense absorption in the spectral range of 400–650 nm. This blue species contains a flavin radical that has been characterized in detail by EPR (25.Kay C.W.M. Feicht R. Schulz K. Sadewater P. Sancar A. Bacher A. Möbius K. Richter G. Weber S.

In contrast, recombinant X. laevis (6-4) photolyase expressed in E. coli is characterized by intense light absorption in the range of 400–500 nm. The yellow species contains the flavin chromophore in its fully oxidized redox form (FADox) (19.Hitomi K. Kim S.-T. Iwai S. Harima N. Otoshi E. Ikenaga M. Todo T. J. Biol.

In this study, the stable blue radical form (FADH·) of the flavin cofactor of (6-4) photolyase was generated by photoreduction of purified recombinant enzyme in the presence of an exogenously added electron donor, followed by aerial oxidation. This radical was examined by continuous-wave EPR spectroscopy and pulsed Davies-type electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR). The hyperfine interactions arising from protons attached to the isoalloxazine moiety of the FAD cofactor were exploited to probe the immediate environment of the flavin, in particular hydrogen bonding and the micropolarity. The main focus of this study is to obtain information about the protonation states of His354 and His358, which are essential for DNA repair by (6-4) photolyase (16.Hitomi K. Nakamura H. Kim S.-T.

This information is crucial for a thorough understanding of the light-independent catalytic steps preceding blue light-initiated enzymatic DNA repair, and the specific structural traits that distinguish (6-4) photolyase from the related CPD photolyase. Protein Preparation−X. laevis wild-type and mutant (6-4) photolyases were overproduced in E. coli, purified as described previously (10.Todo T. Kim S.-T. Hitomi K. Otoshi E. Inui T. Morioka H.

The concentration of the enzyme was determined on the basis of the oxidized FAD cofactor’s absorbance at 450 nm (ε450 = 1.12 × 104 m-1 cm-1) (10.Todo T. Kim S.-T. Hitomi K. Otoshi E. Inui T.

For the present experiments, typically 0.5 mm (6-4) photolyase in a buffer containing 0.1 m NaCl, 0.05 m Tris·HCl (pH 6 to 9.5) and 30% (v/v) glycerol was used. The redox state of the flavin cofactor was monitored by recording the ground state optical absorption spectrum from 300 to 800 nm using a Shimadzu UV-1601PC spectrophotometer. Preparation of a Stable Flavin Radical−Recombinantly produced oxidized (6-4) photolyase samples were supplemented with 10 mm EDTA, illuminated at 4 °C for 1 min with blue light (Halolux 30HL, Streppel, Wermelskirchen-Tente, Germany) selected with a 420–470-nm band filter (Schott, Mainz), and then incubated for about 20 min at 4 °C with air to reoxidize the light-generated dihydroflavin form of the flavin cofactor. The concentration of the resultant blue flavin radical (FADH·) was estimated based on its absorbance at 580 nm (ε580 = 0.48 × 104 m-1 cm-1) (27.Jorns M.S. Wang B. Jordan S.P. Chanderkar L.P. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 552-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Buffer Exchange−Samples were transferred into the desired buffer (usually 0.1 m NaCl, 0.05 m Tris·HCl, or 0.05 m HEPES (pH 6–9.5) in 50% (v/v) glycerol) by dilution and ultrafiltration through Amicon C30 microconcentrators at 4 °C. Experiments in D2O were carried out at pH 8.0 (uncorrected glass electrode reading) by performing a gel filtration chromatography step (HiPrep Desalting, GE Healthcare) at 4 °C. EPR Sample Preparation−The enzyme preparations were transferred into EPR quartz tubes (3 mm inner diameter) under an argon inert-gas atmosphere in the dark. The enzyme was frozen rapidly with liquid nitrogen and stored therein. No changes in the signal line shape and intensity have been observed over a period of several months. EPR/ENDOR Instrumentation−Continuous-wave X-band (microwave frequency, 9.67 GHz/magnetic field, ≈0.345 T) EPR spectra were obtained using a laboratory-built spectrometer described previously (25.Kay C.W.M. Feicht R. Schulz K. Sadewater P. Sancar A. Bacher A. Möbius K. Richter G. Weber S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16740-16748Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). X-band pulsed ENDOR spectra were recorded using a commercial pulse EPR spectrometer Bruker E580 (Bruker BioSpin GmbH, Rheinstetten, Germany) in conjunction with a dielectric-ring ENDOR resonator Bruker ER 4118X-MD5-EN. For Davies-type ENDOR (28.Davies E.R. Phys. Lett. A. 1974; 47: 1-2Crossref Scopus (359) Google Scholar), a microwave pulse sequence π-t-π/2-τ-π using 64- and 128-ns π/2- and π-pulses, respectively, and a radio frequency pulse of a 10-μs duration starting 1 μs after the first microwave pulse was used. The separation times t and τ between the microwave pulses were set to 13 μs and 500 ns, respectively. To avoid saturation effects because of long relaxation times, the entire pulse pattern was repeated with a frequency of only 200 Hz. ENDOR Spectra Analysis−For doublet state radicals, two ENDOR lines were expected per group of magnetically equivalent nuclei according to the first-order resonance condition,vENDOR± = |νn ± (A/2)|, where νn = gnβnB0/h is the Larmor precessional frequency of the nucleus at the respective magnetic field B0, and gn and βn are the nuclear g values and the Bohr magnetons, respectively. In the weak coupling case, |A|<2|νn|, the separation of the line pair is determined by the orientation-dependent hyperfine coupling constant, A, that quantifies the interaction of the nuclear magnetic moment with the electron magnetic moment. The hyperfine couplings from so-called α-protons bonded directly to π-conjugated carbon (or nitrogen) atoms are typically anisotropic, and the interaction symmetry is rhombic, i.e. Ax ≠ Ay ≠ Az, where x, y, and z are the principal axes of the hyperfine tensor. With respect to the C–H (or N–H) bond and the aromatic π-plane, x, y, and z are aligned along the C–H (or N–H) bond, in-plane perpendicular to the C–H (or N–H) bond and parallel to the plane normal, respectively. If one extracts the isotropic part Aiso = (Ax + Ay + Az)/3 from the tensor, the traceless anisotropic hyperfine contributions remain Ti = Ai - Aiso, i ∈ {x, y, z}. These are largely determined by the electron-nuclear dipolar interaction. Following arguments outlined previously for the N5-H5 fragment in FADH· (26.Weber S. Kay C.W.M. Bacher A. Richter G. Bittl R. Chemphyschem. 2005; 6: 292-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), short N–H bond lengths lead to a symmetric rhombic hyperfine tensor with Tz → 0 and Tx =-Ty. When the N-to-H bond length is increased, e.g. as a result of hydrogen bonding of the flavin to the protein backbone, the hyperfine tensor is expected to become more axially symmetric with Tx = Ty ≡ T⊥, and Tz ≡ T∥ → -2T⊥. The isotropic hyperfine coupling of a β-proton is related to the spin density ρπX of the neighboring carbon (X = C) or nitrogen (X = N) atom in the π-plane, and according to the McConnell relation (29.Carrington A. McLachlan A.D. Introduction to Magnetic Resonance. Harper & Row, New York1967: 83-85Google Scholar, 30.Heller C. McConnell H.M. J. Chem.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1969; 62: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), Aiso (Hβ) = ρπX (B′+ B″cos2θ), depends on the spatial orientation of the side chain. From the two empirical constants, B′ and B″, B′ is typically very small, i.e. B′≈ 0. θ is the dihedral angle between the plane normal of the π-system and the projected CβHβ bond. The hyperfine anisotropy of β-protons is typically small and approaches axial symmetry: Tx ≈ Ty ≡ T⊥, Tz ≡ T∥. Spectral Simulations−For ENDOR spectral simulations, the signal amplitudes were normalized to the integral of the signal arising from the hyperfine coupling of H6 in FADH·. This proton is nonexchangeable, and hence, the intensity of its ENDOR signal is expected to remain constant throughout different buffer conditions. Furthermore, H6 is more than 1 nm distant from the proposed substrate-binding pocket. Hence, changes of the protonation states of the histidines close to the substrate-binding site are not expected to alter the intensity or shape of the H6 ENDOR signal pair. To precisely extract the principal values of the hyperfine couplings of the H8α and H1′ probes from the ENDOR data, spectral simulations were performed using the EPR spectral simulation software package EasySpin (33.Stoll S. Schweiger A. J. Magn. Reson. 2006; 178: 42-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (3942) Google Scholar) in conjunction with the MATLAB routine lsqcurvefit (The MathWorks, Natick, MA). This program calculates ENDOR powder spectra arising from two hyperfine tensors and fits their principal values to achieve the best possible agreement with the experimental data. UV-visible Spectroscopic Analyses of the Flavin Cofactor Redox State−FAD cofactors often show characteristic optical absorption properties in all three biologically relevant redox states as follows: fully reduced (FADH- or FADH2), semiquinone radical (FAD. or FADH·), and fully oxidized (FADox). The (6-4) photolyase enzyme from X. laevis is isolated in a yellow form characteristic of a flavoprotein with a fully oxidized FADox. The protein has absorption maxima at 448 and 366 nm that represent the S0 → S1 and S0 → S2 transitions of its flavin cofactor, respectively (Fig. 3). Well resolved vibration side bands at 425 and 475 nm and 356 and 372 nm, respectively, are indicative of tight and well defined noncovalent binding of the chromophore to the highly ordered protein structure. After illumination with blue light (420 < λ < 470 nm) in the presence of EDTA as an exogenous electron donor, the formation of the fully (two-electron) reduced FADH- form of the flavin chromophore is observed (see Fig. 3). A flavin radical, which exhibits absorption maxima at 590 and 635 nm, is subsequently generated by exposure of the enzyme to molecular oxygen. Residual absorbance at around 450 nm is because of flavin molecules that remained in the fully oxidized redox state because of incomplete flavin photoreduction. Under an inert gas atmosphere, the radical is stable on a time scale of hours, whereas back-reaction to the fully oxidized redox state occurs within minutes upon exposure of the enzyme to oxygen at room temperature (data not shown). The similarity of the optical absorption spectrum of the radical form of (6-4) photolyase to that obtained from the radical form of CPD photolyase (34.Payne G. Heelis P.F. Rohrs B.R. Sancar A. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7121-7127Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) allows us to conclude that in (6-4) photolyase the flavin radical is also present in the H5-protonated neutral form, FADH·. Typical for neutral flavin radicals are the absorption bands at 635 nm, which are assigned the D0 → D1 transition, and the weak shoulder at around 510 nm that arises from the D0 → D2 transition (35.Schelvis J.P.M. Ramsey M. Sokolova O. Tavares C. Cecala C. Connell K. Wagner S. Gindt Y.M. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2003; 107: 12352-12362Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). A closer examination of the absorption spectrum of (6-4) photolyase reveals significant red shifts of 10, 10, and 13 nm for the red-most absorption bands at 590 and 635 nm relative to those of E. coli, yeast, and Thermus thermophilus CPD photolyase, respectively (34.Payne G. Heelis P.F. Rohrs B.R. Sancar A. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7121-7127Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 36.Sancar G.B. Smith F.W. Heelis P.F. J. Biol.

Such bathochromic shifts in chromophores are normally caused by more extended delocalization of the π-electron system of aromatic molecules thus implying that FADH· of (6-4) photolyase has altered electronic and hence redox properties as compared with the CPD photolyases, which could be important for its function. Characterization of the Flavin Radical State by EPR Spectroscopy−To obtain a more detailed characterization of the electronic structure of the flavin radical in X. laevis (6-4) photolyase, EPR experiments were performed with a sample that was frozen in liquid nitrogen after generation of the flavin radical. The continuous-wave detected X-band EPR signal (see Fig. 4) reveals a radical signature centered at g = 2.0034 ± 0.0005. The experimentally observed peak-to-peak line width of (2.00 ± 0.01) mT is typical of a neutral flavin radical, FADH·. The overall line width and the line shape of the signal are attributed to the mostly unresolved contributions of hyperfine couplings of the unpaired electron spin with 1H and 14N nuclei of the isoalloxazine moiety of FADH· as well as of the protein environment. Upon buffer deuteration, the exchangeable protons at N5 and N3 are replaced with deuterons. This results in a significant reduction of the inhomogeneous line width, which is clearly visible in Fig. 4. Characterization of the Flavin Radical State by ENDOR Spectroscopy−We have performed ENDOR experiments to further characterize the electronic structure of the FADH· cofactor in (6-4) photolyase. In Fig. 5, the X-band pulsed ENDOR spectrum of the FADH· radical cofactor in protiated buffer is shown. The spectrum was recorded at a magnetic field value corresponding to the center magnetic field position of the X-band continuous-wave EPR signal shown in Fig. 4. In brief, ENDOR signals in five spectral regions between 1 and 37 MHz can be identified. Nearly all signals in this range are symmetrically distributed in pairs around the free proton Larmor frequency, νH = 14.75 MHz. Hence, most proton hyperfine couplings are detected in the weak-coupling limit. (i) The central so-called matrix-ENDOR signal extends from about 13.2 to 16.2 MHz and includes hyperfine couplings from protons whose nuclear spins are only weakly interacting with the unpaired electron spin, which is delocalized over the aromatic π-plane of the FADH· isoalloxazine moiety. Small hyperfine couplings originate from protons in the protein backbone within the cofactor binding pocket, from protons of water molecules surrounding the flavin, and also from weakly coupled protons directly attached to the 7,8-dimethyl isoalloxazine ring, namely H3, H7α, and H9. (ii) Two prominent features are observed in the flanking 10.5–12- and 17.5–19-MHz radio frequency ranges. The tensorial line shapes are of almost axial symmetry and arise from the hyperfine couplings of the β-protons of the methyl group attached to C8. Typically, methyl groups rotate about their C–C bond at elevated temperatures. Hence, if this rotation is fast on the ENDOR time scale, one common hyperfine tensor for all three protons of the methyl group is observed. Signals of the H8α hyperfine tensor are in general easily detected in proton-ENDOR spectroscopy on flavins (25.Kay C.W.M. Feicht R. Schulz K. Sadewater P. Sancar A. Bacher A. Möbius K. Richter G.

Furthermore, theory shows that the size of this coupling responds sensitively to polarity changes of the protein surroundings (42.Weber S. Richter G. Schleicher E. Bacher A. Möbius K. Kay C.W.M. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 1195-1204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). (iii) Flanking the H8α signals at around 9–10.5 and 19–20.5 MHz are found the transitions of one of the two β-protons, H1′, attached to C1′ in the ribityl side chain of the isoalloxazine ring. In flavins, an analysis of this hyperfine coupling together with the one from the weaker-coupled second β-proton at C1′ yields information on the geometry of the ribityl chain attached to N10 as has been shown for the case of E. coli CPD photolyase (25.Kay C.W.M.

(iv) Signals arising from the hyperfine coupling of the H6 proton are found at around 12 and 17.5 MHz. These show a small hyperfine anisotropy, in line with recent quantum-chemical calculations (22.Weber S. Möbius K. Richter G. Kay C.W.M. J. Am. Chem.

Here, we show that Wnt signaling can cause chromosomal instability (CIN). As an indicator of CIN, we scored anaphase bridge index (ABI) in mouse polyps and ES cells where Wnt signaling was activated by Apc or beta-catenin mutations. We found three to nine times higher ABI than in wild-type controls. Furthermore, karyotype analysis confirmed that the Wnt signal-activated ES cells produced new chromosomal aberrations at higher rates; hence CIN. Consistently, expression of dominant-negative TCFs in these cells reduced their ABI. We also found that Wnt signal activation increased phosphorylation of Cdc2 (Cdk1) that inhibited its activity, and suppressed apoptosis upon exposure of the cells to nocodazole or colcemid. The data suggest that Wnt signaling stimulates the cells to escape from mitotic arrest and apoptosis, resulting in CIN. In human gastric cancer tissues with nuclear beta-catenin, ABI was significantly higher than in those without. These results collectively indicate that beta-catenin/TCF-mediated transcription itself increases CIN through dysregulation of G2/M progression."
https://openalex.org/W2002332446,"The DNA strand break-binding molecule, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1), plays a role in DNA repair, chromosomal stability, transcription and cell death. Accumulating evidence suggests that dysfunction of PARP-1 contributes to tumorigenesis. Here, we report that PARP-1 deficiency causes mammary carcinoma formation in female mice, and that the introduction of Trp53 mutations accelerates the onset and shortens the latency of mammary tumorigenesis. We show that PARP-1 deficiency results in chromosomal aneuploidy and centrosome amplification, which are substantiated by the inactivation of Trp53 in primary mammary epithelial (PME) cells. In addition, PARP-1 deficiency compromises p53 activation and impairs BRCA1 recruitment to the sites of DNA damage in PME cells. PARP-1 complementation partly rescues the defective DNA damage response mediated by p53 and BRCA1. The present study thus identifies a role of PARP-1 in suppressing mammary tumorigenesis in vivo and suggests that dysfunction of PARP-1 may be a risk factor for breast cancer in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2072304559,"Tumor suppressor p53 is essential for checkpoint control in response to a variety of genotoxic stresses. DNA damage leads to phosphorylation on the Ser/Thr-Pro motifs of p53, which facilitates interaction with Pin1, a pSer/pThr-Pro-specific peptidyl prolyl isomerase. Pin1 is required for the timely activation of p53, resulting in apoptosis or cell cycle arrest. To investigate the physiological relationship between Pin1 and p53, we created Pin1-/-p53-/- mice. These p53-deficient mice spontaneously developed lymphomas, mainly of thymic origin, as well as generalized lymphoma infiltration into other organs, including the liver, kidneys and lungs. Ablation of Pin1, in addition to p53, accelerated the thymic hyperplasia, but the thymocytes in these Pin1-/-p53-/- mice did not infiltrate other organs. The thymocytes in 12-week-old Pin1-/-p53-/- mice were CD4(-)CD8(-) (double negative) and had significantly higher levels of the intracellular form of Notch1 (NIC) than the thymocytes of p53-/- or wild-type mice. Presenilin-1, a cleavage enzyme for NIC generation from full-length Notch1 was increased in the thymocytes of Pin1-/-p53-/- mice. Pin1 depletion also inhibited the degradation of NIC by proteasomes. These results suggest that both Pin1 and p53 control the normal proliferation and differentiation of thymocytes by regulating the NIC level."
https://openalex.org/W2145061961,"The isoprenoid farnesol has been shown to preferentially induce apoptosis in cancerous cells; however, the mode of action of farnesol-induced death is not established. We used chemogenomic profiling using Saccharomyces cerevisiae to probe the core cellular processes targeted by farnesol. This screen revealed 48 genes whose inactivation increased sensitivity to farnesol. The gene set indicated a role for the generation of oxygen radicals by the Rieske iron-sulfur component of complex III of the electron transport chain as a major mediator of farnesol-induced cell death. Consistent with this, loss of mitochondrial DNA, which abolishes electron transport, resulted in robust resistance to farnesol. A genomic interaction map predicted interconnectedness between the Pkc1 signaling pathway and farnesol sensitivity via regulation of the generation of reactive oxygen species. Consistent with this prediction (i) Pkc1, Bck1, and Mkk1 relocalized to the mitochondria upon farnesol addition, (ii) inactivation of the only non-essential and non-redundant member of the Pkc1 signaling pathway, BCK1, resulted in farnesol sensitivity, and (iii) expression of activated alleles of PKC1, BCK1, and MKK1 increased resistance to farnesol and hydrogen peroxide. Sensitivity to farnesol was not affected by the presence of the osmostabilizer sorbitol nor did farnesol affect phosphorylation of the ultimate Pkc1-responsive kinase responsible for controlling the cell wall integrity pathway, Slt2. The data indicate that the generation of reactive oxygen species by the electron transport chain is a primary mechanism by which farnesol kills cells. The Pkc1 signaling pathway regulates farnesol-mediated cell death through management of the generation of reactive oxygen species."

https://openalex.org/W2027862731,"Cysteine proteases play key roles in apicomplexan invasion, organellar biogenesis, and intracellular survival. We have now characterized five genes encoding papain family cathepsins from Toxoplasma gondii, including three cathepsin Cs, one cathepsin B, and one cathepsin L. Unlike endopeptidases cathepsin B and L, T. gondii cathepsin Cs are exopeptidases and remove dipeptides from unblocked N-terminal substrates of proteins or peptides. TgCPC1 was the most highly expressed cathepsin mRNA in tachyzoites (by real-time PCR), but three cathepsins, TgCPC1, TgCPC2, and TgCPB, were undetectable in in vivo bradyzoites. The specific cathepsin C inhibitor, Gly-Phe-dimethylketone, selectively inhibited the TgCPCs activity, reducing parasite intracellular growth and proliferation. The targeted disruption of TgCPC1 does not affect the invasion and growth of tachyzoites as TgCPC2 is then up-regulated and may substitute for TgCPC1. TgCPC1 and TgCPC2 localize to constitutive secretory vesicles of tachyzoites, the dense granules. T. gondii cathepsin Cs are required for peptide degradation in the parasitophorous vacuole as the degradation of the marker protein, Escherichia coli β-lactamase, secreted into the parasitophorous vacuole of transgenic tachyzoites was completely inhibited by the cathepsin C inhibitor. Cathepsin C inhibitors also limited the in vivo infection of T. gondii in the chick embryo model of toxoplasmosis. Thus, cathepsin Cs are critical to T. gondii growth and differentiation, and their unique specificities could be exploited to develop novel chemotherapeutic agents.

Thus, cathepsin Cs are critical to T. gondii growth and differentiation, and their unique specificities could be exploited to develop novel chemotherapeutic agents. The protozoan parasite, Toxoplasma gondii, is unique in its significant impact in both developed and developing countries. One-third of the population in the United States is infected with toxoplasmosis, as is up to 90% of the populations in other countries. T. gondii causes a serious opportunistic disease in AIDS patients, organ transplant recipients, and newborns who acquire the infection in utero (1.Luft B.J. Remington J.S. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1992; 15: 211-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar, 2.McLeod R. Boyer K. Roizen N. Stein L. Swisher C. Holfels E. Hopkins J. Mack D. Karrison T. Patel D. Pfiffner L. Remington J. Withers S. Meyers S. Aitchison V. Mets M. Rabiah P. Meier P. Curr. Clin. Top. Infect. Dis. 2000; 20: 189-208PubMed Google Scholar). After infection, T. gondii tachyzoites proliferate and disseminate widely to all organs. In immunocompetent hosts, acute infection is limited, and the actively dividing tachyzoites transform into metabolically inactive bradyzoites, leading to life-long latent infection. During congenital infection or following severe immunosuppression, such as by the human immunodeficiency virus, toxoplasmosis can reactivate, causing fatal infection. The need for new drugs is pressing as current optimal therapeutic regimens include sulfonamides, which should not be used in pregnant women and cause frequent toxic side effects in others. T. gondii tachyzoites can invade any nucleated cell and survive intracellularly in a specialized parasitophorous vacuole. Within the vacuole, the tachyzoites salvage essential nutrients from the host cell, a process likely to involve parasite proteinases for peptides <1300 daltons. Cysteine proteinases play key roles in host-parasite interactions, including host invasion, parasite differentiation, and intracellular survival (3.Sajid M. McKerrow J.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 120: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). Cysteine proteinases have been implicated in cell invasion by two other Apicomplexa, Eimeria and Plasmodium. Proteinases of Plasmodium appear to facilitate erythrocyte invasion and rupture by degrading cytoskeletal proteins and provide free amino acids by degrading host hemoglobin in food vacuoles. Specific inhibition of the Plasmodium cysteine proteinases causes accumulation of undegraded erythrocyte cytoplasm in the food vacuoles and inhibits multiplication (3.Sajid M. McKerrow J.H. Mol.

Cathepsin C (also known as dipeptidyl peptidase I, DPPI) is a unique member of the papain family of cysteine proteases that include cathepsins B, L, K, H, and S. In contrast to the endopeptidase activity of other papain family cathepsins, cathepsin C has primarily exopeptidase activity and sequentially removes dipeptides from the free N termini of proteins and peptides (7.Turk D.

Based on specificity differences from host enzymes and their critical role in peptide degradation, Toxoplasma cathepsin Cs play important roles in tachyzoite growth and differentiation and may be exploited as drug targets in the future. Reagents−All reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise specified. All synthetic 4-amino-7-methylcoumarin (AMC) peptide substrates and commercially available peptide inhibitors were obtained from MP Biomedicals (Irvine,CA) and Bachem Bioscience Inc. (King of Prussia, PA). Parasite Isolation−Primary human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF) were initially cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Irvine Scientific, Irvine, CA), penicillin, and streptomycin (50 μg/ml) and maintained subsequently in the same medium with 2% fetal calf serum. T. gondii RH tachyzoites and HXGPRT-deficient strain (National Institutes of Health AIDS Reference and Reagent Repository, Bethesda, MD) were maintained by serial passage in HFF monolayers in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 20 μg/ml gentamicin solution at 37 °C in a humid 5% CO2 atmosphere. Encysted bradyzoites were purified from the brains of OlaHsd or Swiss mice chronically infected with the cyst-forming strain 76 K as described previously (13.Dzierszinski F. Mortuaire M. Dendouga N. Popescu O. Tomavo S. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 1017-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Cloning of the Cathepsin C Genes and Expression Profile−Two cathepsin C family proteinase genes, TgCPC1 and -C2, were amplified from T. gondii cDNA with primers based on partial expressed sequence tag sequence data and the preliminary contigs from the Toxoplasma genome project. The remaining sequences were obtained by 3′- and 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends and cloned into the TA vector and sequenced (12.Que X. Ngo H. Lawton J. Gray M. Liu Q. Engel J. Brinen L. Ghosh P.

All nucleotide sequences and predicted amino acid sequences were compared using the BLAST programs at the National Center for Biotechnology Information. Alignment was performed using ClustalW. Signal sequence prediction was done using SignalIP, and other structural predictions were performed with software available at ExPASy. Total RNA from in vitro cultured tachyzoites of T. gondii was isolated using RNeasy reagent (Qiagen), treated with DNase, and transcribed into single-stranded cDNA using Superscript II reverse transcriptase and oligo(dT) primer (Qiagen). Serial dilutions of cDNA obtained from a known number of tachyzoites were used to generate a standard curve of tubulin mRNA expression. The relative copy number was normalized to the copies of tubulin mRNA by real-time quantitative transcript analysis. Total RNA from in vivo encysted bradyzoites was purified with TRIzol (Invitrogen), treated with DNase, and reverse-transcribed as described previously (13.Dzierszinski F. Mortuaire M. Dendouga N. Popescu O. Tomavo S. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 1017-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Comparative RT-PCR was performed using equal amounts of tachyzoite and bradyzoite cDNAs based on normalization of the amplified cDNA of T. gondii housekeeping actin gene. The cDNA products corresponding to other genes were amplified with 50 pmol of each primer in the presence of 1 μl of ClontechTaq mix DNA polymerase (Clontech) in 50-μl reaction volumes. Thermal cycling conditions for 40 cycles were: 1) denaturation at 94 °C for 10 min; 2) denaturation at 94 °C for 45 s followed by the annealing at 50-60 °C for 1 min and 30 s; 3) elongation for 1 min and 30 s at 72 °C; and 4) additional extension was done at 10 min at 72 °C. Primers used in this study were as follows: TgCPB, forward, 5′-accccggacgactcgttgttt-3′, and reverse, 5′-catttctctctcctcttctgc-3′; TgCPC1, forward, 5′-gatcttccattcacgccacggtac-3′, and reverse, 5′-cattgttttacttttcagagcttca-3′; TgCPC2, forward, 5′-gcgaacggggacttgcctgcccact-3′, and reverse, 5′-tcacccgttctcttttcttccaacact-3′; TgCPL, forward, 5′-atggacagcagcgagacgcactac-3′, reverse: 5′-catcacggggaaagacgcatc-3′; and T. gondii actin gene, forward, 5′-atggcggatgaagaagtgcaa-3′, and reverse, 5′-gatgcacttgcggtggacgat-3′. PCR products were electrophoresed on agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide, and photographed using UV-light scanner. Expression and Purification of rTgCPC1 and -C2−To express recombinant proteins, the coding sequence of the TgCPC1 and TgCPC2 were amplified and cloned in-frame into the pET-22b(+) expression vector (Invitrogen). Proteins were expressed in E. coli as C-terminally His6-tagged recombinant protein and purified on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin column as described previously (12.Que X. Ngo H.

Purification of Native TgCPC Proteinase−T. gondii RH strain tachyzoites were harvested from human fibroblast monolayers, washed with PBS, and purified by filtration through 3.0-μm nucleopore filters and resuspended at 109 cells/ml in hypotonic buffer (25 mm Tris, 10 mm EDTA, pH 7.0). Following three freeze-thaw cycles in liquid nitrogen, the soluble extract was fractionated on PD10 columns. The proteins were further purified by ion exchange fast protein liquid chromatography on a Mono-Q column with elution in a linear gradient of 0-500 mm NaCl in 25 mm Tris, 2 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.4, and column fractions were tested for proteolytic activity against the fluorogenic peptidyl substrate (glycine-arginine-7-amino-4-methyl coumarin, GR-AMC, Enzyme System Products, Livermore, CA) in 96-well microtiter plates. Fractions that contained cathepsin C activity were pooled and concentrated in Centricon-10 centrifugation units (10-kDa cut-off, Millipore, Bedford, MA) and stored at -70 °C (12.Que X. Ngo H.

Purity was assessed by densitometry of the gel with Bio-Rad Quantity One. Assays of Cysteine Proteinase Activity−Proteinase activity was assayed by the liberation of the fluorescent leaving group, AMC, and measured as the increase in fluorescence using an automated microtiter plate spectrofluorometer (LabSystems Fluoroskan II) as described previously (12.Que X.

The initial velocities were calculated by linear regression of the substrate hydrolysis curves. The pH profile of the purified enzyme was determined by assaying cleavage of the preferred synthetic peptide substrate, Gly-Arg-AMC, in buffers with pHs ranging from 4.0 to 10.0 using 50 mm acetate for pH 4-6 and 50 mm Tris for pH 6-10. Enzyme and Inhibition Assays−The inhibitor profile of TgCPC was determined by monitoring inhibition of the cleavage of the preferred substrate, Gly-Arg-AMC (4 μm), in the presence of serial dilutions of the inhibitors. Inhibitors at various concentrations were preincubated with the enzyme (10 nm) for 5 min prior to addition of the substrate. Enzyme activity was expressed as the percentage of residual activity when compared with an uninhibited control and was plotted versus increasing inhibitor concentrations to calculate the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50). Leucine-phenylalanine-vinyl sulfone-methyl was a kind gift from Dr. James Powers (14.Korver G.E. Kam C.-M. Powers J.C. Hudig D. Int. Immunopharmacol. 2001; 1: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Inhibitors were prepared as 10 mm stocks in dimethyl sulfoxide and stored at -20 °C. Parasite Growth Rate−To evaluate the effect of specific proteinase inhibitors on invasion and subsequent intracellular multiplication, TgCPC1 knock-out mutants or RH tachyzoites (2 × 105) were preincubated 30 min at 37 °C in medium alone or medium containing 100 μm cathepsin C inhibitor, glycine-phenylalanine-diazomethylketone (GF-DMK). Parasite replication rates were determined by acridine orange staining at 24 h as described previously (12.Que X. Ngo H. Lawton J. Gray M. Liu Q. Engel J. Brinen L. Ghosh P. Joiner K.A. Reed S.L. J.

Immunofluorescence Microscopy−Parasites were preincubated for 30 min at room temperature in medium alone or containing 50-100 μm cathepsin C inhibitor, GF-DMK, before inoculation at a concentration of 2 × 105 tachyzoites/well and grown on coverslips containing confluent HFF cells. Cells were fixed and permeabilized as described previously (12.Que X. Ngo H. Lawton J. Gray M. Liu Q. Engel J. Brinen L. Ghosh P. Joiner K.A. Reed S.L. J. Biol.

GRA3 monoclonal antibodies were a kind gift from Dr. Isabelle Coppens, anti-microneme and AMA-1 were from Drs. Peter Bradley and John Boothroyd, and anti-ROP4 was from Dr. Gary Ward. Cells were incubated for 90 min with primary antibody diluted 1:1000 in PBS with 3% bovine serum albumin. After washing three times in PBS, samples were incubated with fluorescein-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibody (diluted 1:2000 in PBS, 3% bovine serum albumin) and processed according to the protocol described previously (12.Que X. Ngo H. Lawton J. Gray M. Liu Q. Engel J. Brinen L. Ghosh P. Joiner K.A. Reed S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25791-25797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The slides were mounted with ProLong Gold with and without 4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) nuclear stain (Invitrogen) and examined by epifluorescent microscopy using a Nikon Optiphot fluorescent microscope. Electron Microscopy−For transmission electron microscopic studies, infected monolayers were grown in the presence of medium with or without inhibitor for 24 h (50-100 μm GF-DMK), fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, pH 7.4 for 30 min, washed, and postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide. Fixed samples were embedded in Epon and thin-sectioned for transmission electron microscopy. Images were recorded with a Tecnai 10 transmission electron microscope (FEI Co.). Generation of a TgCPC1 Knock-out Mutant−A 3-kb genomic DNA corresponding to the 5′- and 3′-flanking region of TgCPC1 locus generated by PCR amplification and cloned into the ApaI/XhoI sites of upstream and SpeI/SacI sites of downstream of the pminiHXGPRT vector, respectively (16.Donald R.G. Roos D.S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 91: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). This resulted in the 5′-TgCPC1-miniHXGPRT-3′-TgCPC1 targeting construct. To generate TgCPC1 knock-out mutants, 50 μg of linearized targeting construction (ApaI-digested plasmid) was transfected into 2 × 107 tachyzoites of the T. gondii RH(EP)ΔHXGPRT strain by electroporation using a BTX electro cell manipulator 600, a charging voltage of 2.2 kV, and a resistance of 48 ohms. After transfection, parasites were inoculated onto confluent monolayers of HFF in a T75 flask. Stable transformants were selected using 25 μg/ml mycophenolic acid and 50 μg/ml xanthine added to the culture 24 h after transfection. After two rounds of selection, parasites were cloned in 96-well plates containing confluent HFF cells in the presence of drug as described previously (16.Donald R.G. Roos D.S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 91: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and individual clones were expanded into 24-well plates containing HFF cells for DNA isolation. Parasites from a lysed monolayer were suspended in 250 μl of DNA STAT-60 for DNA extraction (Tel-Test, Inc., Friendswood, TX). Genomic DNA was analyzed by PCR for gene knock-out using primers 5′-GTC TCG TTC GCA ACT ACT CGC ACT-3′(c1ko-1; sense) and 5′-CAC CTT TCT TGC ACG GGC ATG CA-3′ (c1ko-2; antisense), according to the following program: 94 °C for 30 s; 55 °C for 1 min; 72 °C for 2.5 min for 35 cycles. Antibody Production and Immunoblots−Polyclonal antibodies to recombinant TgCPCs were produced by immunizing rabbits three times with 100 μg of purified recombinant protein mixed with Titermax Gold adjuvant (Sigma). The antiserum was affinity-purified by adsorption over a protein G column (Amersham Biosciences) (12.Que X. Ngo H. Lawton J. Gray M. Liu Q. Engel J. Brinen L. Ghosh P. Joiner K.A. Reed S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25791-25797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The antibodies to TgCPC1 and -2 did not cross-react. TgCPC1 and TgCPC2 were immunodetected using rabbit specific polyclonal antisera by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Color substrate nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate buffer solution (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA) or an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences) were used for signal detection, and the intensities of the bands were determined with Image software from the National Institutes of Health. Processing of β-Lactamase Protein (BLA)−To construct a plasmid for transient expression of BLA secretion reporter protein, a fragment encoding BLA was amplified from pBluescript, cloned into the plasmid pNTP/sec vector (a kind gift from Dr. Keith Joiner), and used to transfect the HXGPRT-deficient mutant of T. gondii RH tachyzoites as described previously (17.Nakaar V. Samuel B.U. Ngo E.O. Joiner K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5083-5087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To assess the effect of a cathepsin C proteinase inhibitor on BLA protein processing in vivo, monolayers of fibroblasts in T25 flasks were infected with RH (BLA) tachyzoites (2 × 107) for 24 h at 37 °C in medium alone or containing 100 μm GF-DMK (MP Biomedicals). The infected monolayers were then washed three times with PBS and scraped into cold PBS buffer containing Complete proteinase inhibitors (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) plus 100 μm E-64. The cell pellet was resuspended in cold 6% trichloroacetic acid for at least 1 h on ice. The precipitates were suspended in SDS sample buffer and analyzed by immunoblot with primary monoclonal anti-BLA antibody (1:1,000 dilution; United States Biological, Swampscott, MA) followed by goat anti-mouse conjugate (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) and developed with an nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate buffer solution (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Chicken Embryo Model of Congenital Toxoplasmosis−Fertilized complement fixation for avian leukosis-negative eggs (Charles River SPAFAS, Storrs, CT) were incubated at 37 °C in a humid incubator. To mimic human congenital infection, tachyzoites (104) were injected directly into the chorioallantoic veins of 12-day-old chicken embryos as described previously (18.Que X. Wunderlich A. Joiner K.A. Reed S.L. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 2915-2921Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The controls included eggs that did not receive injections and embryos that were injected with medium and inhibitor alone (18.Que X. Wunderlich A. Joiner K.A. Reed S.L. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 2915-2921Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The eggs were candled daily to assess viability, and at day 15, the embryos were sacrificed, weighed, and fixed in 10% formalin for histopathological examination. The brain and liver tissues of chicken embryos were frozen at -70 °C for quantitative PCR analysis. Quantitation of T. gondii Infection By Real-time Quantitative PCR−To quantitate tachyzoites in vivo, the standard curves for SAG1 were used to extrapolate the numbers of tachyzoites present in unknown samples (18.Que X. Wunderlich A. Joiner K.A. Reed S.L. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 2915-2921Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A standard curve was constructed by mixing 101-107 tachyzoites with brain or liver samples (100 mg) from 15-day-old chicken embryos and homogenizing the preparations with a Dounce homogenizer in DNA STAT-60 (Tel-test, Inc., Friendswood, TX). Purified genomic DNA was used as template for PCR amplification to determine the relative amounts of the major T. gondii surface antigen (SAG1) gene by real-time PCR (18.Que X. Wunderlich A. Joiner K.A. Reed S.L. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 2915-2921Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Expression and Characterization of the cDNAs Encoding T. gondii Cathepsin Cs−We have identified and cloned all three cathepsin C genes from T. gondii. The cDNA sequences encode preproenzymes, each consisting of a signal peptide, a pro region containing two domains that are cleaved, the exclusion and excised prodomains, and a catalytic region (heavy and light chains). The amino acid sequences of the catalytic regions are similar to the mature papain family cathepsins, including cathepsins B and L from T. gondii. Over the entire sequence, the T. gondii and human cathepsin C proteins share 30% identity and 45% similarity (excluding gap positions, Fig. 1). Several residues known to be important for peptidase activity are conserved in TgCPCs: the Asp at the N terminus of the exclusion domain, which blocks the substrate binding cleft beyond the P2 site (7.Turk D.

Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 403: 160-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). A tyrosine residue that binds a chloride ion in the crystal structures of rat and human cathepsin C is also conserved (Tyr-549). Adjacent to the active site cysteine, a distinctive tyrosine residue may be involved in the binding of the N terminus of the peptide substrate. This tyrosine motif appears to be unique in the papain family proteases, in which tryptophan usually occupies the position adjacent to the active site residue. The presence of a putative signal sequence at the N terminus of cathepsin Cs suggests that these proteins transit the Toxoplasma secretory system. In addition, all T. gondii cathepsin C contain a tyrosinebased motif, YXXϕ, where X is any amino acid and ϕ is an amino acid with a bulky hydrophobic side chain, and/or an acidic cluster dileucine motif (TgCPC2) located in their cytoplasmic tails known to participate in endosomal/lysosomal protein sorting in higher eukaryotes (12.Que X.

Expression of Cathepsins in Tachyzoites and Bradyzoites−The transition from rapidly replicating tachyzoites to quiescent bradyzoites is one of the most important in the parasite life cycle. We first quantified the relative expression of the different cathepsins in tachyzoites using real-time quantitative PCR. Specific primers were designed to sequences in β-tubulin, a tachyzoite-specific gene (SAG1), and cathepsins B (TgCPB), L (TgCPL), C1 (TgCPC1), C2 (TgCPC2), and C3 (TgCPC3). The copies of mRNA were normalized to the housekeeping gene, β-tubulin (Fig. 2A, TgTub). TgCPC1 is expressed at high levels in tachyzoites, ∼20 times that of the TgCPC2 mRNA (Fig. 2A). We estimated that TgCPC1 mRNA was 64% of the total CP mRNA, TgCPB was 21%, and TgCPL was 7% of the total CP mRNA in tachyzoites (Fig. 2A). In contrast, TgCPC3 mRNA was below the level of detection in tachyzoites, and the corresponding expressed sequence tags are only found in partially sporulated oocyst cDNA. Thus, TgCPC3 was not further investigated in this study. We next determined the transcriptional expression of cathepsin genes using homogenous mature cysts isolated from brains of chronically infected mice. Using RT-PCR, we confirmed that the level of TgCPC1 transcripts in the tachyzoite is dramatically higher than that of TgCPC2 (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, we demonstrated that TgCPC1, TgCPC2, and TgCPB mRNA cannot be detected in the in"

In the present study incubation of C2C12 myocytes with 100 mm EtOH decreased protein synthesis while markedly increasing the phosphorylation of eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2), a key component of the translation machinery. Both mTOR and MEK pathways were found to play a role in regulating the effect of EtOH on eEF2 phosphorylation. Rapamycin, an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin, and the MEK inhibitor PD98059 blocked the EtOH-induced phosphorylation of eEF2, whereas the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB202190 had no effect. Unexpectedly, EtOH decreased the phosphorylation and activity of the eEF2 upstream regulator eEF2 kinase. Likewise, treatment of cells with the inhibitor rottlerin did not block the stimulatory effect of EtOH on eEF2, suggesting that eEF2 kinase (eEF2K) does not play a role in regulating eEF2. In contrast, increased eEF2 phosphorylation was correlated with an increase in AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation and activity. Compound C, an inhibitor of AMPK, suppressed the effects of EtOH on eEF2 phosphorylation but had no effect on eEF2K, indicating that AMPK regulates eEF2 independent of eEF2K. Finally, EtOH decreased protein phosphatase 2A activity when either eEF2 or AMPK was used as the substrate. Thus, this later action may partially account for the increased phosphorylation of eEF2 in response to EtOH and the observed sensitivity of AMPK to rapamycin and PD98059 treatments. Collectively, the induction of eEF2 phosphorylation by EtOH is controlled by an increase in AMPK and a decrease in protein phosphatase 2A activity.

In this regard, eEF1A promotes the GTP-dependent binding of aminoacyl-tRNAs to ribosomes, and eEF2, a monomeric protein of ∼100 kDa, is responsible for the GTP-dependent translocation step (1Merrick W.C. Nyborg N. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 59-125Google Scholar). Among the various elongation factors, phosphorylation of eEF2 by the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent eEF2 kinase (eEF2K) is the most studied mechanism controlling the elongation rate (2Ryazanov A.G. Rudkin B.B. Spirin A.S. FEBS Lett. 1991; 285: 170-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 3Riis B. Rattan S.I. Clark B.F. Merrick W.C. Trends Biochem.

FEBS Lett. 1991; 282: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of eEF2 decreases its activity, thereby impairing the rate of elongation and contributing to an overall inhibition of protein synthesis (8Celis J.E. Madsen P. Ryazanov A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4231-4235Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 9Ryazanov A.G. Shestakova E.A. Natapov P.G.

Similar to eEF2, the activity of eEF2 kinase is regulated through multisite phosphorylation in response to various stimuli. Interestingly, phosphorylation of this kinase can regulate eEF2 either negatively or positively, depending on the stimuli and the particular residue that is phosphorylated (10Browne G.J. Proud C.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5360-5368Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar).A number of signaling pathways are involved in the regulation of eEF2K and eEF2. For instance, the induced phosphorylation of eEF2K and eEF2 by various growth factors (e.g. insulin and insulin-like growth factor-I) and hormones (e.g. serotonin, phenylephrine) is mediated by mTOR and MEK/ERK signaling (11Lenz G.

Likewise, these phosphorylation events can be regulated via p38 MAPK, although the involvement of this pathway is stimuli- and phosphorylation site-specific (16Knebel A. Haydon C.E. Morrice N. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 525-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 17Knebel A. Morrice N. Cohen P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4360-4369Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In contrast, other data suggest that the mTOR, MEK, and p38 pathways are only involved in regulating eEF2 but not eEF2K. For example, treatment with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin, the MEK1 inhibitor PD98059, or the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB202190 did not affect eEF2K phosphorylation in the presence of cholecystokinin (18Sans M.D. Xie Q. Williams J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 319: 144-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) even though eEF2 phosphorylation was sensitive to these inhibitors.Protein synthesis in general and peptide-chain elongation in particular are energetically expensive processes. One cellular mechanism regulating energy homeostasis is the 5′-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Activation of AMPK in response to various stimuli including low cellular energy levels, hypoxia, ischemia, hormones, and electrical stimulation is associated with increased phosphorylation of eEF2 and inhibition of protein synthesis (19Crozier S.J.

This phosphorylation may be due to increased eEF2K activity, because it has been suggested that eEF2K activity is enhanced by phosphorylation events mediated by the AMPK pathway (24Horman S.

In contrast, studies using an eEF2K inhibitor suggested that eEF2K might not be involved in this process (26Ren H. Tai S.K. Khuri F. Chu Z. Mao L. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 5841-5847Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent studies showed that activation of AMPK is not correlated with increased phosphorylation of eEF2 in skeletal and heart muscle cells in response to exercise (24Horman S. Beauloye C.

Brown C.R. Huber D.S. Lang C.H. Alcohol Clin. Exp. Res. 2006; 30: 1297-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, little is known concerning the mechanisms by which EtOH regulates eEF2. The aim of the present study was to examine the effects of EtOH on signaling events regulating eEF2 phosphorylation in C2C12 myocytes. Increased phosphorylation of eEF2 after EtOH treatment was associated with decreased phosphorylation and activity of eEF2K, suggesting that eEF2K is not involved in the control of eEF2 in C2C12 myocytes. On the other hand, EtOH increased the phosphorylation and activity of AMPK, and this enzyme directly phosphorylated eEF2, thus suggesting a link between changes in AMPK activity and eEF2 phosphorylation. Finally, EtOH resulted in a general decrease in phosphatase activity and a specific decrease in protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity toward eEF2 and AMPK.MATERIALS AND METHODSEtOH was purchased from Fisher Scientific Co. The majority of the antibodies used in this study were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). These included a rabbit monoclonal antibody recognizing the phosphorylated (p) form of AMPK-α (Thr-172) and polyclonal antibodies specific for p-eEF2 (Thr-56), p-eEF2K (Ser-366), p-acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Ser-79), p-mTOR, p-MEK, and p-ERK1/2. Antibodies to total AMPK-α, eEF2, eEF2K, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, and the MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 were also obtained from the same source. The AMPK inhibitor, compound C, the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB202190, okadaic acid, and rottlerin were purchased from Calbiochem (EMD Biosciences, San Diego, CA). Rapamycin and [35S]methionine/cysteine (>1000 Ci/mol) were obtained from MP Biomedicals (Aurora, OH), whereas protein phosphatase inhibitor I-2 was from Sigma. The phosphatase assay kit and PP2A antibody were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). AICAR was purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals, Inc. (Northyork, ON, Canada), and cell culture media and fetal bovine serum (FBS) were from Invitrogen.Cell Culture—C2C12 mouse myoblasts were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and amphotericin (25 μg/ml). The effects of EtOH on protein synthesis were determined as previously described (28Hong-Brown L.Q. Brown C.R. Huber D.S. Lang C.H. Alcohol Clin. Exp. Res. 2006; 30: 1297-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 29Hong-Brown L.Q. Frost R.A. Lang C.H. Alcohol Clin. Exp. Res. 2001; 25: 1373-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). 100 mm EtOH was used unless otherwise indicated because this concentration produces an effect without being cytotoxic to the cells (28Hong-Brown L.Q. Brown C.R. Huber D.S. Lang C.H. Alcohol Clin. Exp. Res. 2006; 30: 1297-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). All experiments were conducted using cells at the myoblast stage. For metabolic labeling, cells were incubated in the presence of EtOH and radioisotope for 24 h before harvesting. Alternatively, cells were pretreated with EtOH for 24 h and then metabolically labeled for various periods of time in the presence of EtOH. Cells were labeled with 10 μCi of [35S]methionine/cysteine in 2% FBS media because C2C12 myocyte survival is decreased when cells are cultured for extended periods in serum-free media. In preliminary studies the rate of radiolabel incorporation into protein was linear between 1 and 24 h (data not shown) indicating there was no significant change in the specific activity of the precursor pool. Hence, all subsequent studies were conducted using the 24-h labeling protocol. At the end of the experiment, cells were collected and precipitated in 10% trichloroacetic acid, and the incorporation of [35S]methionine/cysteine into trichloroacetic acid-precipitable protein was determined via liquid scintillation counting. The results were then compared with those of the appropriate time-matched control group, and data are expressed as a percentage of the control value.Immunoblot Analysis—C2C12 myocytes were subcultured in 6-well plates in the presence of EtOH for 24 h as described previously (24Horman S.

Thereafter, cells were changed to serum-free media in the continued presence of this agent and collected after 15 min in 2× Laemmli sample buffer unless otherwise indicated. Equal amounts of protein from cell lysates were electrophoresed on denaturing polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. The resulting blots were blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk and incubated with the antibodies of interest as described above. Unbound primary antibody was removed by washing with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (ICI Americas, Inc, Wilmington, DE), and blots were incubated with anti-rabbit immunoglobulin conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. Blots were briefly incubated with an enhanced chemiluminescent detection system (Amersham Biosciences) and exposed to Eastman Kodak Co. x-ray film. The film was scanned (ScanMaker 4, Microtek, Los Angeles, CA) and analyzed with NIH Image 1.6 software.eEF2K and AMPK Activity Assay—For kinase activity measurements, cells were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 containing 20 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, and a mixture of protease and phosphatase inhibitors. AMPK and eEF2K activities were determined as described previously (30Fujii N. Hirshman M.F. Kane E.M. Ho R.C. Peter L.E. Seifert M.M. Goodyear L.J. J. Biol.

Briefly, cell extracts were immunoprecipitated overnight with a specific antibody against eEF2 or with antibodies to the eEF2K or α catalytic subunit of AMPK. The antibody-antigen complex was captured by incubation for 1 h with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Immune complexes were washed with lysis buffer and then incubated with reaction buffer A (40 mm Hepes, 0.2 mm AMP, 80 mm NaCl, 0.8 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.2 mm [γ-32P]ATP) or buffer B (50 mm Hepes, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 100 μm CaCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.6 μg of Ca2+/calmodulin, and 50 μm [γ-32P]ATP) in a total volume of 50 μl for measuring AMPK or eEF2K activity, respectively. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 10–14 min at 30 °C and then terminated by the addition of 2× Laemmli sample buffer and heating for 5 min. Samples were run on SDS-PAGE gels, dried at 80 °C, and quantitated using phosphorimaging. The results were standardized with total protein as determined using a BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce).Phosphatase Assay—Myocytes were incubated with EtOH as above, and phosphatase activity was measured using a Ser/Thr phosphatase assay kit from Upstate Biotechnology. Briefly, cells were lysed with buffer containing 20 mm imidazole-HCl (pH 7.0), 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, and a mixture of protease inhibitors. For detection of PP2A or total phosphatase activity, lysates were incubated for 15–25 min at room temperature with a phosphopeptide (RKpTIRR; pT is phosphothreonine) or with eEF2 that was immunoprecipitated using anti-eEF2 antibody. The reaction was terminated after the addition of the malachite green reagent. Free phosphatase was then quantified by measuring the absorbance at 620 nm. To examine the ability of PP2A to dephosphorylate eEF2 and AMPK, an in vitro phosphatase assay was conducted. For these experiments, either eEF2 or AMPK was immunoprecipitated from untreated cells and used as the substrate, while PP2A was isolated from control and EtOH-treated cells. Substrates and phosphatase were incubated together at room temperature for 25 min, and PP2A activity was quantitated as described above.Statistical Analysis—For experimental protocols with more than two groups, statistical significance was determined using one-way analysis of variance followed by the Dunnett's test to compare all data to the appropriate time-matched control group. For experiments with only two groups, an unpaired Student's t test was performed. Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. A value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.RESULTSEffects of EtOH on Basal Protein Synthesis—EtOH inhibits protein synthesis in various cell and tissue types, including muscle cells (28Hong-Brown L.Q. Brown C.R. Huber D.S. Lang C.H. Alcohol Clin. Exp. Res. 2006; 30: 1297-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 32Lang C.H. Frost R.A. Deshpande N. Kumar V. Vary T.C. Jefferson L.S. Kimball S.R. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 285: 1205-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Although the mechanisms mediating the effects of EtOH are not fully characterized, there are a number of signaling pathways that regulate the activity of both translation initiation and elongation factors, and these may be adversely affected by EtOH. In the present study we examined the effects of EtOH on protein synthesis in C2C12 myocytes. In addition, we characterized the role that the mTOR, MAPK, and AMPK signaling pathways play in regulating the phosphorylation of elongation factor eEF2 in response to this drug.Initially, we determined the dose- and time-dependent effects of EtOH on the basal rate of protein synthesis. For these experiments, cells were metabolically labeled for 24 h in the presence or absence of increasing concentrations of EtOH. Alternatively, cells were labeled for various periods of time in the presence or absence of 100 mm EtOH. Treatment of cells with 80, 100, or 120 mm EtOH significantly decreased protein synthesis when results were compared with untreated control cells (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, a 24-h incubation with 100 mm EtOH was required before a significant decline of protein synthesis was observed (Fig. 1B). The absence of an effect after either 2- or 8-h EtOH treatment suggests that there is a lag phase between EtOH exposure and a reduction in protein synthesis. As such, the cumulative 15% decrease observed during the 24-h labeling period most likely underestimates the maximal level of decrease that occurs once EtOH begins to elicit an inhibitory effect. To address these issues, cells were incubated in the presence or absence of 100 mm EtOH for 24 h and then metabolically labeled. EtOH-treated cells were labeled for various periods of time in media containing 100 mm EtOH, whereas time-matched control cells were labeled in media lacking EtOH. A significant 38% decrease in protein synthesis was observed when cells were preincubated for 24 h and then labeled for 30 min in the presence of fresh EtOH (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, the effects of EtOH gradually decreased over time, suggesting that this drug exerts a transitory effect on protein synthesis.EtOH-induced Phosphorylation of eEF2 Is Dependent on mTOR and MEK Pathways—The activity of eEF2 is critical for the elongation step of translation, and this activity is negatively regulated by phosphorylation (33Carlberg U. Nilsson A. Nygard O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 191: 639-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). To determine the effects of EtOH on eEF2 phosphorylation, cells were incubated in the presence or absence of 100 mm EtOH for 24 h. As illustrated in Fig. 2A, incubation of cells with EtOH increased phosphorylation of eEF2 by ∼35%, as compared with untreated controls. Therefore, this increase may account at least partially for the adverse effects of EtOH on protein synthesis. Next, EtOH-treated cells were given an additional 15 min of incubation with 100 mm fresh EtOH to determine whether this would enhance the effects of EtOH on signaling events. Under these circumstances there was a dramatic 3-fold increase in eEF2 phosphorylation levels. These results are consistent with our protein synthesis studies, where there was a greater decrease in synthesis after the re-addition of EtOH as compared with cells treated for 24 h alone. Taken together, these data indicate that C2C12 cells require a period of time to become sensitized to the effects of EtOH. Furthermore, the maximal effects of this drug are most readily apparent immediately after the re-addition of the drug. Based upon these results, for subsequent experiments, cells were routinely pretreated with EtOH for 24 h and then given a 15-min incubation with fresh EtOH before harvest.FIGURE 2Effects of EtOH and signaling inhibitors on eEF2 phosphorylation. C2C12 myocytes were incubated in the presence or absence of EtOH (100 mm) as described under “Materials and Methods.” For EtOH treatments, some cells were treated in this drug for 24 h and then harvested (24Horman S. Beauloye C. Vertommen D. Vanoverschelde J.L. Hue L. Rider M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41970-41976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), whereas others were treated for 24 h and then given an additional incubation with fresh EtOH for 15 min (24/15). Cell extracts were collected and analyzed via Western blotting using anti-phospho-eEF2 (Thr-56) and total eEF2 antibodies (panel A). To delineate the role of different signaling pathways, cells were preincubated for 1 h in the presence or absence of inhibitors before treatment with EtOH. Rapamycin (panel B), the inhibitor of the mTOR pathway, was used at 100 nm; PD98059 (panel C), the inhibitor of the MEK/ERK pathway, was used at 20 μm, and SB202190 (panel D), the inhibitor of the SAPK (stress-activated protein kinase)/p38 MAPK pathway, was used at 20 μm. Results are expressed as a percentage of basal control levels. Each bar graph represents the mean ± S.E. of three-five independent experiments consisting of four replicate samples per experiment.

Haydon C.E. Morrice N. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 525-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 34Wang X. Li W. Williams M. Terada N. Alessi D.R. Proud C.G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4370-4379Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). To determine whether EtOH affected eEF2 via these pathways, myocytes were treated with EtOH in the presence or absence of various inhibitors. Incubation with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin had no effect on the constitutive level of eEF2 phosphorylation, although total eEF2 was decreased ∼20% compared with control (Fig. 2B). Treatment of myocytes with a combination of rapamycin and EtOH completely suppressed the EtOH-induced phosphorylation of eEF2, and this effect was partly due to a decrease in total eEF2 content (∼24%). These data suggest that there is a requirement for the mTOR-dependent pathway in the regulation of eEF2 phosphorylation. The MAPK pathway also appears to play a role in this process. The observed increase in eEF2 phosphorylation in response to EtOH was greatly repressed in the presence of the MEK inhibitor PD98059 (Fig. 2C). Note, however, that the level of phosphorylated eEF2 in these cells was still slightly, but significantly elevated compared with the control group, which may be due to the requirement for mTOR in this process. Finally, we examined the role of the p38 MAPK pathway in mediating the effects of EtOH. Fig. 2D illustrates that treatment with the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB202190 significantly increased eEF2 phosphorylation in control myocytes (∼2-fold). Thus, inhibition of this MAPK pathway activates eEF2 in a manner similar to EtOH. Likewise, the combination of EtOH and SB202190 significantly increased the levels of phosphorylated eEF2 relative to the control value. These data suggest that EtOH does not regulate eEF2 via p38 MAPK signaling.Because the mTOR and MEK pathways both regulated the effects of EtOH on eEF2 phosphorylation, it is possible that these represent sequential signaling events. To test this idea, we examined whether rapamycin had any effect on MEK phosphorylation in the presence of EtOH or, alternatively, whether PD98095 had an effect on mTOR phosphorylation under these same conditions. EtOH decreased levels of p-MEK1/2 and p-ERK1/2, but this decrease was not influenced by the presence of rapamycin (data not shown). Likewise, PD98095 did not modulate the effect of EtOH on the phosphorylation levels of mTOR. Thus, it appears that these two pathways are not activated in sequence but most likely function in parallel.EtOH-induced Phosphorylation of eEF2 Is Not Controlled by eEF2K— eEF2 is purportedly regulated by the calcium- and calmodulin-dependent kinase eEF2K, and the activity of this kinase is controlled by phosphorylation events (9Ryazanov A.G. Shestakova E.A. Natapov P.G. Nature. 1988; 334: 170-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the effect of EtOH on the phosphorylation of eEF2K. Unexpectedly, incubation of myocytes with 100 mm EtOH significantly decreased eEF2K phosphorylation on the Ser-366 residue by ∼50% when compared with control values (Fig. 3A). Moreover, this EtOH-induced decrease in phosphorylated eEF2K was independent of a change in the total amount of eEF2K protein. To determine the kinetics of the effects of EtOH on eEF2K phosphorylation, a time course was conducted in which cells were preincubated with EtOH for 24 h and then incubated with fresh EtOH for various periods of time. The phosphorylation of eEF2K decreased at all time points examined between 5 and 30 min (Fig. 3B), although the greatest decline (∼50%) was observed when cells were incubated with EtOH for 15 min. Note that decreased levels of eEF2K phosphorylation were inversely correlated with increases in eEF2 phosphorylation (Fig. 3C). Therefore, these data suggest that eEF2K does not regulate the phosphorylation of eEF2 in response to EtOH.FIGURE 3Dose- and time-dependent effects of EtOH on eEF2K and eEF2 phosphorylation. C2C12 myocytes were treated with 100 mm EtOH for 24 h and then incubated with fresh EtOH for either 15 min (panel A) or for various periods of time (panels B and C). For comparative purposes, time-matched controls were maintained and labeled in media lacking EtOH. Cell extracts were analyzed via Western blotting using anti-phospho-eEF2K (panels A"

We showed in a previous study that the diffusion of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), a family of nuclear receptors regulating major cellular and metabolic functions, is modulated by ligand binding. In this study, we combine fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, dual color fluorescence cross-correlation microscopy, and fluorescence resonance energy transfer to dissect the molecular mechanisms controlling PPAR mobility and transcriptional activity in living cells. First, we bring new evidence that in vivo a high percentage of PPARs and retinoid X receptors is associated even in the absence of ligand. Second, we demonstrate that coregulator recruitment (and not DNA binding) plays a crucial role in receptor mobility, suggesting that transcriptional complexes are formed prior to promoter binding. In addition, association with coactivators in the absence of a ligand in living cells, both through the N-terminal AB domain and the AF-2 function of the ligand binding domain, provides a molecular basis to explain PPAR constitutive activity.

PPARs are lipid sensors capable of adapting gene expression to integrate various lipid signals coming from intracellular signaling pathways, from inter-organ cross-talk, or even from the diet (2.Feige J.N. Gelman L. Michalik L. Desvergne B. Wahli W. Prog. Lipid Res. 2006; 45: 120-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). Given their partially overlapping yet specific expression patterns, the three receptors cooperate to efficiently regulate metabolic functions (3.Desvergne B. Michalik L. Wahli W. Physiol. Rev. 2006; 86: 465-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 4.Evans R.M. Barish G.D. Wang Y.X. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar) as well as other cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, or apoptosis that are essential to the fate of the tissues and organs in which they are expressed (2.Feige J.N. Gelman L. Michalik L. Desvergne B. Wahli W. Prog. Lipid Res. 2006; 45: 120-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar, 5.Michalik L. Wahli W. J. Clin. Investig. 2006; 116: 598-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). PPARs are also important pharmaceutical targets as specific synthetic ligands exist for the different isotypes, and these are either currently used or hold promise for the treatment of major metabolic disorders such as hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes, and obesity (6.Berger J.P. Akiyama T.E. Meinke P.T. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2005; 26: 244-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). Thus, understanding the molecular mechanisms that account for target gene specificity represents a major challenge that will help to develop safer and more efficacious drugs. At the structural level, PPARs are composed of distinct domains that constitute the hallmark of the nuclear receptor superfamily. The central DNA binding domain allows binding to specific PPAR-response elements located in the promoter of target genes. Binding to these elements requires heterodimerization with the retinoid X receptor (RXR), the PPAR/RXR complex being constitutively associated prior to ligand binding (7.Feige J.N. Gelman L. Tudor C. Engelborghs Y. Wahli W. Desvergne B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17880-17890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The C-terminal ligand binding domain encompasses the ligand-dependent transactivating function (called AF-2). It accounts for the major effects the receptors exert on gene transcription by recruiting accessory proteins called coactivators, which can remodel chromatin and contact the basal transcriptional machinery (8.Lonard D.M. O’Malley B.W. Cell. 2006; 125: 411-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). In contrast, the N-terminal AB domain is less structured but includes a weak ligand-independent transactivating function (called AF-1), which presumably acts through the basal recruitment of coactivators (9.Gelman L. Zhou G. Fajas L. Raspe E. Fruchart J.C. Auwerx J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7681-7688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and by modulating the structure and the activity of the entire receptor when post-translationally modified (2.Feige J.N. Gelman L. Michalik L. Desvergne B. Wahli W. Prog. Lipid Res. 2006; 45: 120-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar, 10.Gelman L. Michalik L. Desvergne B. Wahli W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the specificity and the efficacy of target gene regulation by the different PPARs rely on an interplay between the actions of these different domains, the balance between corepressor and coactivator binding, and the promoter context (2.Feige J.N. Gelman L. Michalik L. Desvergne B. Wahli W. Prog. Lipid Res. 2006; 45: 120-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar, 11.Guan H.P. Ishizuka T. Chui P.C. Lehrke M.

Most structural and regulatory proteins of the nucleus are extremely dynamic, and their mobility is associated with major events, such as the control of nuclear architecture or the regulation of gene expression and mRNA export (14.Gorski S.A. Dundr M. Misteli T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 284-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), mobility being required for embryonic stem cell differentiation programs, for example (15.Meshorer E. Yellajoshula D. George E. Scambler P.J. Brown D.T. Misteli T. Dev. Cell. 2006; 10: 105-116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). As a consequence, the association of a large number of nuclear proteins and transcription factors with chromatin is transient, suggesting that these proteins find their targets through a three-dimensional scanning of the genome (16.Phair R.D. Scaffidi P. Elbi C. Vecerova J. Dey A. Ozato K. Brown D.T. Hager G. Bustin M. Misteli T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6393-6402Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). The interactions of nuclear receptors with chromatin are also highly dynamic because their residence time on promoters has been estimated to be in the range of 10 s using models with multimerized response elements compatible with live cell imaging (17.McNally J.G. Muller W.G. Walker D. Wolford R. Hager G.L. Science. 2000; 287: 1262-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). In addition, the global association of nuclear receptors and coregulators with endogenous promoters is cyclical (18.Metivier R. Penot G. Hubner M.R. Reid G. Brand H. Kos M. Gannon F. Cell. 2003; 115: 751-763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1247) Google Scholar, 19.Shang Y. Hu X. DiRenzo J. Lazar M.A. Brown M. Cell. 2000; 103: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). Finally, using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), certain receptors such as the estrogen, glucocorticoid, and androgen receptors (ER, GR, and AR) exhibit reduced mobility and partial immobilization upon agonist treatment (20.Schaaf M.J. Cidlowski J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1922-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 21.Maruvada P. Baumann C.T. Hager G.L. Yen P.M. J. Biol.

J. 2004; 86: 3473-3495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). On the contrary, this is not observed with other receptors such as PPARs (7.Feige J.N. Gelman L. Tudor C. Engelborghs Y. Wahli W. Desvergne B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17880-17890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and the thyroid hormone and retinoic acid receptors (21.Maruvada P. Baumann C.T. Hager G.L. Yen P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12425-12432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). As reduction in mobility and enhanced immobilization upon ligand binding affect only certain receptors and correlate with their ability to accumulate in subnuclear structures termed speckles, it has been speculated that these reduced dynamics could actually be linked to the engagement of the receptor in these so far poorly defined structures (22.Stenoien D.L. Patel K. Mancini M.G. Dutertre M. Smith C.L. O’Malley B.W. Mancini M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 25.Schaaf M.J. Lewis-Tuffin L.J. Cidlowski J.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 1501-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) is an alternative to FRAP for the analysis of protein mobility in living cells with high spatial and temporal resolution. By using this technique, we were able to demonstrate that although PPARs do not form ligand-induced speckles and are not immobilized upon ligand binding in FRAP experiments, they nevertheless have a smaller diffusion coefficient than expected for a PPAR/RXR heterodimer and do exhibit a ligand-dependent reduction in mobility (7.Feige J.N. Gelman L. Tudor C. Engelborghs Y. Wahli W. Desvergne B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17880-17890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In this study, we dissected the molecular mechanisms governing PPAR mobility. PPAR diffusion is governed by the association with coregulators, both in the absence and presence of ligand, and the size of the complexes is enlarged upon agonist binding. In contrast, DNA binding has no global impact on the diffusion of the entire population, and PPARs most probably do not perform a three-dimensional scanning of chromatin to reach their targets. Interestingly, our data also demonstrate that the N-terminal AB domain plays an important role in coregulator recruitment in living cells. Plasmid Constructs−The cloning of the cDNAs encoding mouse PPARα, PPARβ, and PPARγ1 as well as RXRα into the pEYFP-N1 and -C1 and pECFP-N1 and C1 plasmids (Clontech) has been described previously (7.Feige J.N. Gelman L. Tudor C. Engelborghs Y. Wahli W. Desvergne B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17880-17890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The ECFP-DEVD-EYFP construct was a kind gift of Dr. J. M. Tavaré (Westphalian Wilhelms University, Münster, Germany). The cDNA for the monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP) was kindly donated by Dr. Tsien (26.Campbell R.E. Tour O. Palmer A.E. Steinbach P.A. Baird G.S. Zacharias D.A. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7877-7882Crossref PubMed Scopus (2006) Google Scholar). The expression vector for the mRFP-PPARα fusion protein was generated by flanking the mRFP cDNA with the NheI and XhoI sites by PCR amplification and cloning of the PCR product into pEYFP-C1-mPPARα in place of EYFP. The EYFP-mPPARαΔ13 construct was generated by PCR amplification of the truncated cDNA followed by cloning into pEYFP-C1 using the XhoI and BamHI restriction sites. The EYFP-C1-mPPARαC122S construct was generated from the corresponding WT vector by site-directed mutagenesis of codon 122 (TGT to AGT) and the EYFP-mPPARαΔAB by deletion of the bases corresponding to residues 21–99. The plasmid encoding EYFP-p300N-term was constructed by cloning bases 1–1790 (residues 1–595) of the human p300 cDNA into pEYFP-C1 using HindIII and BamHI as restriction sites. The EYFP-Med1 receptor interacting domain (RID) construct was generated by cloning a PCR amplification product corresponding to residues 550–716 of Med1 into pEYFP-C1, using BglII and SalI. Cell Culture and Transient Transfection Assays−Cells were grown and transfected as described before (7.Feige J.N. Gelman L. Tudor C. Engelborghs Y. Wahli W. Desvergne B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17880-17890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The generation of the HeLa H2B-EYFP cell line has been reported previously (27.Weidemann T. Wachsmuth M. Knoch T.A. Muller G. Waldeck W. Langowski J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 334: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Wy14,643 (Cayman Chemical Co.), L-165041 (synthesized at custom in the CIG Laboratory), rosiglitazone (Sigma), GW6471 (synthesized at custom by Zydus, India), and 9-cis-retinoic acid (Biomol) were used at respective final concentrations of 10–5, 5 × 10–6, 10–6, 10–5, and 10–6 m. FCS Experiments−Transfections were performed as described previously in 8-well chambered cover glasses with 100 ng of vector per cm2 of cell culture plate (7.Feige J.N. Gelman L. Tudor C. Engelborghs Y. Wahli W. Desvergne B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17880-17890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Measurements in living cells were also performed as reported previously on a commercial LSM510 ConfoCor2 combination system (Zeiss) at room temperature (7.Feige J.N. Gelman L. Tudor C. Engelborghs Y. Wahli W. Desvergne B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17880-17890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Fluorescence intensity fluctuations were recorded using an avalanche photodiode at five spots in each nucleus. At each spot, measurements were performed over 25 s and repeated five times. On average, 10 cells per condition were analyzed. For the nuclear extracts a laser beam was focused 200 μm above the bottom of a cover slide where 10 μl of extract was deposited. dcFCCS Experiments−Cellular dcFCCS measurements were performed on the LSM510/ConfoCor2 system with a water immersion objective (C-Apochromat, ×40, 1.2NA; Zeiss). The 488-nm line of the argon laser (AOTF 0.1%, ∼25 microwatts) was used to excite EGFP, and the 543-nm line of the HeNe laser (AOTF 7%, ∼70 microwatts) was used to excite mRFP. The excitation light was reflected by a dichroic mirror (HFT 488/543) and focused through a type C-Apochromat ×40/1.2W objective lens. The fluorescence emission light was split by a second dichroic mirror (NFT 570) into two separate beam paths and passed through a 505–530-nm bandpass filter for EGFP fluorescence and a 600–650-nm bandpass filter for mRFP fluorescence. Each confocal pinhole diameter was set to 70 μm. After preparation of the cells in 8-well chambered cover glasses (NUNC A/S), laser scanning microscopy was used to search for cells suitable for dcFCCS. The laser beam was focused at a selected spot, and a dcFCCS measurement (10 times for 20 s) was performed. After the fitting of the curves (see below), the relative cross-correlation (degree of binding) was calculated from the following formula: CCrel = Gcross(0)/Ggreen(0), with Gcross(0) and Ggreen(0) being the amplitudes of the cross- and green autocorrelation curves, respectively. The cross-talk between channels was also taken into account for the calculation of interactions (28.Bacia K. Kim S.A. Schwille P. Nat. Meth. 2006; 3: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Fitting of FCS Correlation Curves−Auto- and cross-correlation curves were fitted with the Origin software (OriginLab) by a Levenberg-Marquardt nonlinear least square method to a free (nuclear extracts or living cells) or an anomalous (living cells only) diffusion model to derive the translational diffusion time through the confocal volume. The apparent diffusion coefficients obtained for each curve were then averaged or represented as a frequency histogram. Nuclear Extracts−COS-7 cells were transfected in 6-well plates. At 36 h post-transfection, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, harvested, and centrifuged. The pellet was lysed in 400 μl of hypo-osmotic buffer (10 mm Tris, 10 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1× protease inhibitor mixture (PIC), 0.2 mm PMSF) with a Dounce homogenizer. Nuclei were then isolated by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm during 5 min and lysed in 50 μl of hyper-osmotic buffer (50 mm Tris, 400 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton, 10% glycerol, 1× PIC, 0.2 mm PMSF). After centrifugation, the supernatant was diluted with 3 volumes of 50 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1× PIC, 0.2 mm PMSF to bring the salt concentration to 100 mm. Nuclear extracts were stored at –20 °C and incubated with ligands for 2 h at 4 °C before FCS analysis. Pulldown Experiments−DNA and coregulator pulldowns were performed as described previously (9.Gelman L. Zhou G. Fajas L. Raspe E. Fruchart J.C. Auwerx J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7681-7688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 29.IJpenberg A. Tan N.S. Gelman L. Kersten S. Seydoux J. Xu J. Metzger D. Canaple L. Chambon P. Wahli W. Desvergne B. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2083-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Ligands were both used at 100 μm. Western Blots−Cells were lysed and protein extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE as described previously (9.Gelman L. Zhou G. Fajas L. Raspe E. Fruchart J.C. Auwerx J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7681-7688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The primary antibody against GFP (Roche Applied Science) was diluted at 1:5000 and detection was performed using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL advance; Amersham Biosciences). FRET Experiments−Donor and acceptor proteins were adjusted to similar levels by Western blot, and sensitized emission FRET was performed as described previously (30.Feige J.N. Sage D. Wahli W. Desvergne B. Gelman L. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2005; 68: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Briefly, fluorescence was recorded in three different settings as follows: CFPex, 405 nm/CFPem, 465–485 nm; YFPex, 514 nm/YFPem, 525–545 nm; and FRETex, 405 nm/FRETem, 525–545 nm. Laser power and detector gain were adjusted in the different channels in order to observe equimolar concentrations of CFP and YFP at equal intensities, and settings were kept unchanged for analysis of all samples. FRET was calculated using the expNFRET formula that corrects spectral bleed throughs by using an exponential fit of the spectral bleed through ratio and normalizes for differences in donor and acceptor expression (30.Feige J.N. Sage D. Wahli W. Desvergne B. Gelman L. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2005; 68: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Statistical Analyses−Data are presented as means ± S.E., and p values for statistical significance were evaluated with a Student’s t test. An Anomalous Diffusion Model Is a Better Model for Fitting PPAR FCS Autocorrelation Curves−FCS is one of the most sensitive techniques currently available in single molecule analysis. FCS is based on an analysis of fluctuations of fluorescence intensity because of the diffusion of fluorescent molecules through a very small volume (in the range of 1 μm3). Among a multitude of physical parameters that are accessible by FCS, it most conveniently enables the direct measurement of diffusion coefficients and local concentrations (31.Dittrich P. Malvezzi-Campeggi F. Jahnz M. Schwille P. Biol. Chem. 2001; 382: 491-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The fluorescence signal recorded at microsecond resolution (Fig. 1A) is used to extract a so-called “autocorrelation curve” (Fig. 1B, upper panels). The experimental points along this curve are then fitted with an autocorrelation function G(t) that mathematically reflects the diffusion properties of the fluorescent molecules. In a previous study analyzing the localization and diffusion of EYFP-tagged PPARs in living cells (7.Feige J.N. Gelman L. Tudor C. Engelborghs Y. Wahli W. Desvergne B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17880-17890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), we used a one-component model of free diffusion to fit autocorrelation curves and thereby obtained satisfactory statistical (χ2) values. However, with the nucleus being extremely crowded and presenting numerous potential obstacles and binding sites for a transcription factor such as PPAR, we realized that anomalous diffusion (AD) might actually better describe PPAR mobility in living cells (32.Wachsmuth M. Waldeck W. Langowski J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 677-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Although the mean square displacement of a particle following normal diffusion is proportional to time (〈r2(t) 〉∼ t), anomalous diffusion is defined by 〈r2(t) 〉∼ tα, where the anomalous coefficient α reflects the interaction of the diffusing particle with its environment. This coefficient varies between 0.1 and 1, a value of 1 actually indicating free diffusion in a homogeneous environment. When autocorrelation curves of EYFP-PPAR diffusion in living cells were fitted with a one-component model, the residual curves were noisy, indicating some systematic deviations, whereas these deviations were much smaller when the AD model was used (Fig. 1B, lower panels). AD particularly improved the fit in the 0.1–10-ms range, a zone in which the accuracy of diffusion time determination is particularly sensitive. It is noteworthy that the diffusion coefficients obtained with anomalous diffusion are close to those originally obtained with a one-component model (Table 1) and confirm our former conclusions as follows: (i) PPAR diffusion in the absence of ligand is slower than expected if the receptor was roaming the nucleus as a monomer or even as a heterodimer with RXR, and (ii) ligand binding further slows down the diffusion of the receptor. Because the AD model is more precise and reflects better the physiological nuclear environment experienced by the receptor, we applied this model to all our measurements in living cells. In contrast, when experiments were performed in vitro in nuclear extracts where the nucleoplasm is highly diluted and structures impairing free diffusion have been removed, AD modeling gave an anomalous parameter α = 1, indicating free diffusion. FCS measurements in these conditions were therefore fitted with a single component model.TABLE 1The diffusion coefficients of EYFP-PPARs in living cells obtained with an anomalous diffusion model are close to those obtained with a one-component model of free diffusionDiffusion coefficientOne component free diffusionAnomalous diffusionμm2/sEYFP (nucleus)19.7 ± 0.5622.6 ± 2.5EYFP-PPARα4.8 ± 0.216.4 ± 0.86EYFP-PPARα + Wy14,6433.0 ± 0.193.3 ± 0.35p<0.01aStatistical difference with sample without ligand is shown.EYFP-PPARβ5.5 ± 0.236.7 ± 0.58EYFP-PPARβ + L-1650413.5 ± 0.174.6 ± 0.40p<0.05EYFP-PPARγ5.0 ± 0.246.5 ± 0.53EYFP-PPARγ + rosiglitazone2.3 ± 0.114.2 ± 0.68p<0.01a Statistical difference with sample without ligand is shown. Open table in a new tab A High Proportion of PPAR and RXR Receptors Readily Form Heterodimers in Living Cells in the Absence of Ligand−By using FRET, we previously demonstrated that, contrary to a general assumption, PPARs and their heterodimeric partner RXR are readily associated before ligand activation (7.Feige J.N. Gelman L. Tudor C. Engelborghs Y. Wahli W. Desvergne B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17880-17890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Only PPARα exhibited a slightly enhanced interaction with RXR upon ligand binding. However, we could not determine by FRET the proportion of receptors that were heterodimerized. This question is of importance not only with respect to PPAR mechanism of action but also to that of RXR, which can also homodimerize and heterodimerize with other partners. We therefore performed dual color fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy (dcFCCS) to address this issue. Briefly, dcFCCS enables the diffusion of two molecules labeled with spectrally different fluorophores to be measured and gives the concentration of free and interacting species as well as their respective diffusion coefficients (Fig. 2, A and B). The concentrations of the fluorescent PPAR and RXR chimeras were derived from the autocorrelation curves, and the analysis was performed only on cells where the ratios between PPAR and RXR concentrations were between 1 and 4. The average percentage of RXR molecules interacting with PPARα was 60 and 68% in the absence and presence of the PPAR ligand Wy14,643, respectively (Fig. 2C). FCS experiments require analysis of cells where EYFP fusion proteins are expressed at concentrations in the low nanomolar range. In our previous study, we estimated EYFP-PPARα concentrations and found them to be lower than those of the endogenous protein in mouse liver cells (7.Feige J.N. Gelman L. Tudor C. Engelborghs Y. Wahli W. Desvergne B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17880-17890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), therefore suggesting that these values can be extrapolated to endogenous PPAR and RXR. The activity of PPAR/RXR heterodimers may also be regulated by an RXR agonist (2.Feige J.N. Gelman L. Michalik L. Desvergne B. Wahli W. Prog. Lipid Res. 2006; 45: 120-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). In Fig. 3, we represent the diffusion coefficients that can be determined from the auto-correlation curves, the measurements being represented as a frequency histogram. Consistently, addition of 9-cis-retinoic acid to living cells induced a reduction of EYFP-PPAR mobility, but on average to a lower extent than a PPAR agonist (Fig. 3 and Table 2). This result is consistent with the fact that not all PPARs interact with RXR molecules and provides further evidence for the permissive nature of the PPAR/RXR heterodimer and the role of RXR in the modulation of PPAR activity and transcriptional activation. In line with the transactivation studies we performed previously (7.Feige J.N. Gelman L. Tudor C. Engelborghs Y. Wahli W. Desvergne B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17880-17890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), this result also indicates that enough endogenous RXR is present for the action of EYFP- or mRFP-PPARs, whose expression levels are kept as low as possible (hardly detected by laser scanning microscopy) to allow proper auto-correlation function derivation and to avoid overexpression artifacts.TABLE 2Binding of 9-cis-RA by RXR decreases PPAR mobility in living cellsDiffusion coefficientStatistical analysisμm2/sEYFP-PPARα6.7 ± 0.50EYFP-PPARα + Wy14,6433.3 ± 0.28p<0.01aStatistical difference with sample without ligand is shown.EYFP-PPARα +9-cis-RA4.7 ± 0.42p<0.01p = 0.011bStatistical difference with sample with PPAR-specific ligand only is shown.EYFP-PPARα + Wy14,643 + 9-cis-RA3.5 ± 0.14p<0.01p = 0.63p = 0.015cStatistical difference with sample with 9-cis-RA only is shown.EYFP-PPARβ6.7 ± 0.50EYFP-PPARβ + L-1650413.5 ± 0.53p<0.01EYFP-PPARβ + 9-cis-RA5.0 ± 0.53p = 0.029p = 0.038EYFP-PPARγ7.5 ± 0.24EYFP-PPARγ + rosiglitazone2.9 ± 0.50p<0.01EYFP-PPARγ + 9-cis-RA4.8 ± 0.25p<0.01p<0.01a Statistical difference with sample without ligand is shown.b Statistical difference with sample with PPAR-specific ligand only is shown.c Statistical difference with sample with 9-cis-RA only is shown.

We established two independent cell lines from a fast growing mouse breast tumor (WAP-SVT/t transgenic animal). Cells from one line (ME-A cells) are sensitive to apoptotic stimuli such as growth factor depletion or treatment with antitumor agents (e.g. doxorubicin). Cells from the second line (ME-C cells), which carry a missense mutation at the p53 codon 242, are very insensitive to apoptotic stimuli. Co-cultivation experiments revealed that the ME-C cells mediate cell death resistance to the ME-A cells. Microarray and Western blot analysis showed that osteopontin (OPN) is selectively overexpressed by the ME-C cells. This glycoprotein is the most abundant protein secreted by the ME-C cells and we obtained strong indications that OPN is the main antiapoptotic factor. However, the OPN containing ME-C cell medium does not alter the expression level of pro- or antiapoptotic genes or known inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs). Its signaling involves mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK)1/2 as the kinase inhibitor PD98059 restores apoptosis but not the Akt inhibitor. In the ME-A cells, mitochondrial cytochrome c release occurs with and without external apoptotic stimuli. OPN containing ME-C cell medium does not prevent the mitochondrial cytochrome c release and caspase-9 processing. In serum starved ME-A cells, the OPN containing ME-C cell medium prevents caspase-3 activation. However, in doxorubicin-treated cells, although apoptosis is blocked, it does not inhibit caspase-3. This indicates that the ME-A cells distinguish between the initial apoptotic stimuli and that the cells possess a further uncharacterized control element acting downstream from caspase-3."

Further studies on the functional role of ERβ-mediated upregulation of antioxidative enzymes indicated protective effects against estrogen-induced oxidative DNA damage (ODD). We now report on in vivo and in vitro studies that show that ERβ-mediated upregulation of QR are involved in the protection against estrogen-induced mammary tumorigenesis. Using the August Copenhagen Irish (ACI) model of estrogen-induced carcinogenesis, we observed that increased ODD and decreased QR expression occur early in the process of estrogen-induced mammary tumorigenesis. Prevention of ACI mammary gland tumorigenesis by tamoxifen was accompanied by decreased ODD and increased QR levels. These correlative findings were supported by our findings that downregulation of QR levels led to increased levels of estrogen quinone metabolites and enhanced transformation potential of 17β-estradiol treated MCF10A non-tumorigenic breast epithelial cells. Concurrent expression of ERβ and treatment with 4-hydroxytamoxifen decreased tumorigenic potential of these MCF10A cells. We conclude that upregulation of QR, through induction by tamoxifen, can inhibit estrogen-induced ODD and mammary cell tumorigenesis, representing a possible novel mechanism of tamoxifen prevention against breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2001216837,"By translocating proteasomal degradation products into the endoplasmic reticulum for loading of major histocompatibility complex I molecules, the ABC transporter TAP plays a focal role in the adaptive immunity against infected or malignantly transformed cells. A key question regarding the transport mechanism is how the quality of the incoming peptide is detected and how this information is transmitted to the ATPase domains. To identify residues involved in this process, we evolved a Trojan horse strategy in which a small artificial protease is inserted into antigenic epitopes. After binding, the TAP backbone in contact is cleaved, allowing the peptide sensor site to be mapped by mass spectrometry. Within this sensor site, we identified residues that are essential for tight coupling of peptide binding and transport. This sensor and transmission interface is restructured during the ATP hydrolysis cycle, emphasizing its important function in the cross-talk between the transmembrane and the nucleotide-binding domains. This allocrite sensor may be similarly positioned in other members of the ABC exporter family."
https://openalex.org/W1991733975,"The role of WT1 (Wilm's tumor suppressor gene) in breast cancer is controversial, with evidence for both tumor-promoting and tumor-suppressing activities. In order to address this question, we expressed different WT1 isoforms in the mammary epithelial cell line H16N-2, which does not express endogenous WT1. Cells were stably transfected with either WT1 (-Ex5/-KTS) or WT1 (+Ex5/+KTS) under the control of the inducible metallothionein promoter. Induction of WT1 (-Ex5/-KTS) upregulated p21, causing a slowing of proliferation and a G2-phase cell cycle arrest. In artificial basement membrane, the WT1 (-Ex5/-KTS) isoform promoted the appearance of highly organized acinar cellular aggregates. In contrast, WT1 (+Ex5/+KTS) had no effect on p21 or proliferation, but rather caused an epithelial-mesenchymal transition and a redistribution of E-cadherin from the cell membrane to the cytoplasm. This isoform also causes the cellular aggregates growing in artificial basement membrane to appear significantly less organized than control cells. Thus, different WT1 isoforms have distinct effects in this cell line, suggesting that depending on the ratio of WT1 isoform expression in mammary epithelial cells, WT1 could function to either promote or suppress a transformed phenotype."

By oligonucleotide microarray hybridization of polysomal RNA of untreated and STI571-treated 32D-BCR/ABL cells, we identified the beta-chemokine CCL9 as a gene regulated by BCR/ABL in a tyrosine kinase-dependent manner. BCR/ABL repressed CCL9 expression at the transcriptional level by mechanisms involving suppression of p38 MAP kinase, and modulation of the activity of CDP/cut and C/EBPalpha, two transcription regulators of myeloid differentiation. However, repression of C/EBP-dependent transcription did not prevent the induction of CCL9 expression by STI571, suggesting that C/EBPalpha is involved in maintaining rather than in inducing CCL9 expression. Restoration of CCL9 expression in 32D-BCR/ABL cells had no effect on the in vitro proliferation of these cells, but reduced their leukemogenic potential in vivo, possibly by recruitment of CD3-positive immune cells. Together, these findings suggest that downregulation of chemokine expression may be involved in BCR/ABL-dependent leukemogenesis by altering the relationship between transformed cells and the microenvironment."

Chembiochem. 2002; 3: 596-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). To be active, Cdks must be bound to an appropriate cyclin molecule and free from inhibition by Cdk inhibitors. Their action can be further controlled by changes in subcellular localization and phosphorylation state. Cdks therefore have a variety of ways in which their activity can be modulated in response to extrinsic (e.g. presence of growth factor) or intrinsic (e.g. completion of DNA synthesis) cues (4.Malumbres M. Barbacid M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 630-641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar, 5.Morgan D.O. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Transitions from G2 to mitosis and from G1 into S phase are key cell cycle control points. Simple eukaryotes have a single Cdk (Cdk1, or Cdc2 and Cdc28 in budding and fission yeast, respectively) that controls both of these transitions. Higher eukaryotes have multiple Cdks (Cdk1 to Cdk11) with more specialized roles, but Cdk1 and its role in promoting mitosis have been conserved. In the normal cell cycle, mitotic cyclins (cyclins A, B, and B3) accumulate during G2, and Cdk1 is held in a relatively inactive state by inhibitory phosphorylation at residues Tyr15 (in fission yeast) or Thr14 and Tyr15 (higher eukaryotes). Two kinases (Myt1 and Wee1) and one phosphatase (Cdc25) determine the phosphorylation status of these residues, and, together with Cdk1, these are thought to constitute a molecular switch that commits cells to undergo mitosis. Thus, in late G2, the sudden increase in Cdk1 activity that coincides with entry into mitosis is thought to be achieved by a double positive feedback loop in which Cdk1 kinase activity both inhibits Wee1 kinase and activates Cdc25 phosphatase (9.O’Farrell P.H. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 512-519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The resulting flood of Cdk1 activity promotes mitosis by phosphorylating a range of nuclear substrates (e.g. lamins and histone H3) until its mitotic partner, cyclin B, is degraded at anaphase. The intrinsic cellular signals that determine when this switch is turned on during a normal cell cycle are unclear. The in vivo importance of inhibitory phosphorylation of Cdk1 has been demonstrated by experiments involving mutant Cdk1 proteins lacking phosphorylation sites. Fission yeasts with a Y15F mutation advance prematurely into mitosis (10.Gould K.L. Nurse P. Nature. 1989; 342: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar), whereas vertebrate cells overexpressing Cdk1 with T14A and Y15F substitutions (Cdk1-AF) undergo mitotic catastrophe (i.e. entry into mitosis before DNA replication is complete, resulting in aberrant mitosis and cell death) (11.Krek W. Nigg E.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3331-3341Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 12.Norbury C. Blow J. Nurse P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3321-3329Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). In a variety of systems, mutation of Cdk1 inhibitory phosphorylation sites also impairs G2 arrest in response to genotoxic damage, indicative of signaling pathways that sense such damage and culminate in the inhibitory phosphorylation of Cdk1 (13.Blasina A. Paegle E.S. McGowan C.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1013-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 14.Fletcher L. Cheng Y. Muschel R.J.

Despite the crucial role that inhibitory phosphorylation of Cdk1 undoubtedly plays in regulating the G2/M transition, it remains unclear whether the autocatalytic burst of Cdk1 activity that accompanies Cdk1 dephosphorylation is absolutely required to promote the G2/M transition or whether relief from other inhibitory mechanisms can suffice. Another conserved role for Cdk1 is to ensure that S phase is dependent on completion of a preceding mitosis. This role was first revealed in fission yeast after inactivation of Cdk1/cyclin B; cells failing to enter mitosis do not simply arrest in G2 but reset in G1 and enter successive but discrete rounds of S phase, leading to cells with ploidies of 4, 8, 16 N, etc. (16.Correa-Bordes J. Nurse P. Cell. 1995; 83: 1001-1009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 17.Hayles J. Fisher D. Woollard A. Nurse P. Cell. 1994; 78: 813-822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 18.Moreno S. Nurse P. Nature. 1994; 367: 236-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). A similar endoreduplication phenotype was observed when Cdk1 was depleted in human cells by genetic means (19.Itzhaki J.E. Gilbert C.S. Porter A.C.G. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 258-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In fission yeast, Cdk1 binds at replication origins and prevents the formation of prereplication complexes, apparently by phosphorylating key components of the prereplication complex (20.Wuarin J. Buck V. Nurse P. Millar J.B. Cell. 2002; 111: 419-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and various components of the mammalian prereplication complex are also known to be phosphorylated by Cdk1 (21.Blow J.J. Dutta A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 476-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 22.Diffley J.F. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: R778-R786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Thus, assuming that the serine kinase activity of Cdk1 is required to suppress endoreduplication during S and G2, the question arises of how this is achieved without promoting premature mitosis. To address questions of this kind, it is useful to have a genetic system in which the functionality of variant Cdk1 proteins can be analyzed in cells depleted for endogenous Cdk1. The human HT2-19 cell line is uniquely suited to this purpose (19.Itzhaki J.E. Gilbert C.S. Porter A.C.G. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 258-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). HT2-19 cells have one inactivated CDK1 allele and one allele that is regulated by the lac repressor. In the presence of IPTG, Cdk1 protein levels and kinase activity in HT2-19 cells are 30–40% of those in parental HT1080 cells but sufficient for cell proliferation, albeit with an increased doubling time. After removal of IPTG, Cdk1 protein levels and kinase activity decline to <10% of +IPTG values, and appreciable endoreduplication is observed, accompanied by apoptosis. Because they can be rescued from IPTG dependence by transfection with a Cdk1 expression plasmid (19.Itzhaki J.E. Gilbert C.S. Porter A.C.G. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 258-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), HT2-19 cells can be used in complementation tests to assess the functionality of variant Cdk1 proteins. In the present study, we find that the Cdk1 from Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Cdc2) cannot rescue HT2-19 cells from IPTG dependence, whereas human Cdk1-AF can. Further analysis reveals that the latter complementation requires a small amount of residual endogenous Cdk1 expression, without which cells fail to divide or endoreduplicate. These results indicate that some, but not all, cellular Cdk1 must be susceptible to inhibitory phosphorylation for a successful G2 to M transition. The results also suggest a model in which two thresholds of Cdk1 activity must be exceeded sequentially during the cell cycle, the first to inhibit endoreduplication and the second to promote entry into mitosis. Cell Culture and Electroporation−HT1080 and HT2-19 cell culture and stable transfection by electroporation using a Gene Pulser electroporator (Bio-Rad) were as described (19.Itzhaki J.E. Gilbert C.S.

To select for colonies stably transfected with pZeoSV derivatives, 200 μg/ml zeocin was added to the medium 48 h after transfection. Where required, IPTG was added to the medium to a final concentration of 0.2 mm. Plasmids−pBSgpt and pBSgptCDC have been described previously (19.Itzhaki J.E. Gilbert C.S. Porter A.C.G. Nat.

To make pBSgptcdc-sp, a 1-kb BamHI fragment from pTZ19R.cdc2 (kindly donated by Chris Norbury, Oxford University, UK) and the 10.5-kb NdeI fragment of pBSgptCDC were end-filled and ligated. To make pTetCDK1-WT-HA-zeo and pTetCDK1-AF-HA-zeo, a 1.3-kb EcoRV/PvuII fragment from pCMVzeo (Invitrogen) was ligated to SspI-linearized pUHD10-3-CDC2-HA or pUHD10-3-CDC2-A14F15-HA, respectively. For all plasmids, the correct orientation and sequence of CDK1 inserts were confirmed by restriction enzyme digestions and DNA sequencing, respectively. A CDK1 gene-targeting construct, pCDC/zeo, was made by inserting an end-filled 1.3-kb BamHI-SspI fragment from pZeoSV (Invitrogen) into pCDC2AX (19.Itzhaki J.E. Gilbert C.S. Porter A.C.G. Nat.

For actin, a primary rabbit antibody (A-2066; 1:1000 dilution; Sigma) and secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin antibody (P0448; Dako) were used. Flow Cytometry−Flow cytometric analysis of nuclei for DNA content was as described previously (19.Itzhaki J.E. Gilbert C.S. Porter A.C.G. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 258-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Gene Targeting−The CDK1 gene targeting construct pCDC/zeo (10 μg) was linearized at a unique Asp718 site and electroporated into clone AF18 cells. Zeocin-resistant colonies were screened by a PCR assay for targeted integration at the CDK1 allele using primers 5′-CCTTTGTCATCAATCAAGAG-3′ (CDK1 gene) and 5′-ATACGTAGATGTACTGCCAA-3′ (zeocin cassette). PCR was performed on pellets of 1000–10,000 cells as described previously (19.Itzhaki J.E. Gilbert C.S. Porter A.C.G. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 258-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). To determine whether the desired (functional) CDK1 allele had been targeted, thereby removing all endogenous Cdk1 expression, PCR-positive clones were analyzed by immunoblotting with Cdk1 antibody. RNA Interference−RNA oligonucleotide pairs specific for endogenous CDK1 (5′-GAUGUAGCUUUCUGACAAAAA-3′ and 5′-UUUGUCAGAAAGCUACAUCUU-3′) or GFP (5′-GGCUACGUCCAGGAGCGCACC-3′ and 5′-UGCGCUCCUGGACGUAGCCUU-3′) were obtained preannealed from Dharmacon and delivered to cells by Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, cells were plated at 50% confluence in 2- or 3.5-cm diameter wells in antibiotic-free medium the day before transfection. Unless indicated otherwise, HT2-19 cells were maintained in medium with IPTG. HT2-19 derivatives were maintained in medium without IPTG. The following day, a mixture containing 600 nm siRNA and Oligofectamine (3% (v/v)) in Opti-MEM was prepared according to the manufacturer’s instructions and added to cells (100 or 500 μl/well) with 5 volumes of antibiotic-free medium, to give a final siRNA concentration of 100 nm. Fixing, staining and microscopy of cells was as previously described (19.Itzhaki J.E. Gilbert C.S. Porter A.C.G. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 258-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Human Cdk1-AF Rescues HT2-19 Cells from Cdk1 Depletion−A plasmid (pBSgptCDC) carrying the human Cdk1 cDNA driven by the CDK1 promoter and the bacterial gpt gene, which confers resistance to mycophenolic acid and xanthine (MPA/X), was previously shown to rescue HT2-19 cells from IPTG dependence (19.Itzhaki J.E. Gilbert C.S. Porter A.C.G. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 258-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Derivatives of pBSgptCDC were made to encode human Cdk1 with a C-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) tag and either with (pBSgptCDK1-AF-HA) or without (pBSgptCDK1-WT-HA) accompanying T14A and Y15F mutations. A further pBSgptCDC derivative (pBSgptcdc-sp) was made to express the only Cdk of S. pombe, Cdc2. Four complementation experiments were carried out (Table 1) to test one or more of these plasmids or empty vector (pBSgpt) expressing only the gpt gene for their ability to rescue HT2-19 cells from IPTG dependence. Electroporated HT2-19 cells were selected for gpt expression (in MPA/X and IPTG) or for both gpt expression and IPTG independence (in MPA/X alone). Spontaneous IPTG independence in HT2-19 (19.Itzhaki J.E. Gilbert C.S. Porter A.C.G. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 258-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) (as indicated by IPTG-independent colonies appearing after transfection with pBSgpt) occurred to varying extents but was sufficiently infrequent to allow the detection of IPTG independence conferred by exogenous Cdk1 expression. Thus, above background levels of IPTG-independence were clearly conferred by pBSgptCDK1-WT-HA and, unexpectedly, by pBSgptCDK1-AF-HA. When expressed as a percentage of all gpt+ colonies, the frequencies of IPTG independence conferred by pBSgptCDK1-WT-HA and pBSgptCDK1-AF-HA were similar (14 versus 24% and 23 versus 17% in experiments 1 and 3, respectively). Within the sensitivity of the complementation assay, Cdk1-AF-HA and Cdk1-WT-HA therefore appear to compensate for Cdk1 depletion with very similar efficiencies. The expression plasmid for Cdc2 (pBSgptcdc-sp) was unable to confer above background levels of IPTG independence (Table 1, experiment 2). This was confirmed when none (0 of 45) of the MPA/X resistance colonies of experiment 4 (Table 1) survived in the absence of IPTG, although most (3 of 4) of the colonies tested by immunoblotting were shown to express the S. pombe protein (not shown).TABLE 1Complementation tests in HT2-19PlasmidnaNumber of HT2-19 cells electroporated (×10-6).Colonies surviving selectionbNumber of colonies generated in the indicated selection conditions (half of the electroporated cells were used for each selection).Selection ratiocNumber of colonies in column 4 as a percentage of those in column 3.Transfection efficiencydNumber of colonies in column 3 divided by number of cells plated.MPA/X/IPTGMPA/X%× 104Experiment 1pBSgpt1042250.08pBSgptCDK1-WT-HA107819240.16pBSgptCDK1-AF-HA108312140.17Experiment 2pBSgpt6NAeNA, not available.2NANApBSgptCDK1-WT-HA6NA35NANApBSgptCDK1-AF-HA6NA28NANApBSgptsp-cdc67833.82.5Experiment 3pBSgpt3.5119000.68pBSgptCDK1-WT-HA3.57613170.43pBSgptCDK1-AF-HA3.5307230.17Experiment 4pBSgptcdc-sp6>300NANA>0.5a Number of HT2-19 cells electroporated (×10-6).b Number of colonies generated in the indicated selection conditions (half of the electroporated cells were used for each selection).c Number of colonies in column 4 as a percentage of those in column 3.d Number of colonies in column 3 divided by number of cells plated.e NA, not available. Open table in a new tab Cdk1-WT-HA and Cdk1-AF-HA Expression in IPTG-independent HT2-19 Transfectants−To confirm that exogenous Cdk1 was expressed in IPTG-independent transfectants and that endogenous Cdk1 expression was still IPTG-dependent, several IPTG-independent clones from experiment 2 (Table 1) were analyzed by immunoblotting with a Cdk1 antibody (Fig. 1). As expected from previous studies (12.Norbury C. Blow J. Nurse P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3321-3329Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 15.Jin P. Gu Y. Morgan D.O. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 963-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 24.Solomon M.J. Lee T. Kirschner M.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 13-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), both endogenous and exogenous Cdk1 were detectable as a triplet of bands, the latter triplet migrating more slowly than the former because of the HA tag and, for clones transfected with CDK1-AF expression plasmid, lacking the upper two bands that represent Thr14- and Tyr15-phosphorylated protein. Thus, six bands (two triplets) were detected in pBSgptCDK1-WT-HA-rescued clones (clones WT1, WT2, etc.), whereas only the four fastest migrating of these were detected in pBSgptCDK1-AF-HA-rescued clones (clones AF8, AF14 etc.) In most clones, endogenous Cdk1 bands were also distinguishable from exogenous Cdk1 bands by their dependence on IPTG. A few clones (e.g. WT1 and AF22) had, however, lost IPTG-dependent expression of endogenous Cdk1, suggestive of a spontaneous reversion event, as previously noted (19.Itzhaki J.E. Gilbert C.S. Porter A.C.G. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 258-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Interestingly, although some of the Cdk1-WT-HA-rescued clones (e.g. WT7 and WT9) expressed substantially more exogenous than endogenous Cdk1, this was not the case for any of the Cdk1-AF-HA-rescued clones. Indeed, the amount of Cdk1-AF-HA protein relative to endogenous Cdk1 was remarkably similar between clones, consistent with the idea that excessive expression of Cdk1-AF-HA is not tolerated by cells, whereas a minimum level is required to compensate for endogenous Cdk1 depletion. These results supported the conclusion from the complementation analysis (Table 1) that Cdk1-AF-HA, as well as Cdk1-WT-HA, is capable of compensating for the Cdk1 deficiency in HT2-19 cells grown in the absence of IPTG. Histone H1 Kinase Activity in IPTG-independent HT2-19 Transfectants−To confirm that exogenous Cdk1 was active in the rescued clones, histone H1 kinase assays were carried out on immunoprecipitates of two Cdk1-WT-HA-rescued clones (WT2 and WT3) and two Cdk1-AF-HA-rescued clones (AF18 and AF29) that had been treated with or without nocodazole (Fig. 2). By inhibiting microtubule polymerization, an 8-h treatment with nocodazole increases the mitotic index of cultures ∼5-fold (data not shown). Similar amounts of anti-HA-precipitable H1 kinase activity were detected in all four clones, but the H1-kinase activity was substantially increased by nocodazole treatment of clones WT2 and WT3, whereas no such increase was seen for clones AF18 and AF29 (Fig. 2A). Similar results were obtained when separate lysates were prepared and immunoprecipitated with a different anti-HA antibody (supplemental Fig. 1S). These results confirm that Cdk1-WT-HA, like endogenous Cdk1, is activated by loss of inhibitory phosphorylation upon entry into mitosis, whereas Cdk1-AF-HA is not. Endogenous H1 kinase activity, as detected in anti-Cdk1 immunoprecipitates, was similar in all four rescued clones, being low but detectable and noticeably elevated in samples from nocodazole-treated cells (Fig. 2B). The Cdk1 antibody does not immunoprecipitate HA-tagged Cdk1, because it recognizes a C-terminal epitope that is disrupted by the addition of the HA tag. The fact that the HA-associated activity before nocodazole treatment is similar in all four rescued clones is consistent with the similar amounts of non-phosphorylated exogenous protein, relative to endogenous Cdk1 protein, seen in these clones (Fig. 1). Cdk1-AF-HA Expression Is Tolerated by HT1080 Cells but Is Selectively Disadvantageous−The ability of Cdk1-AF-HA to complement the Cdk1 deficiency in HT2-19 cells was a surprise, given the published data describing the toxic effects of transient Cdk1-AF expression. To determine whether the apparent tolerance of Cdk1-AF-HA expression was a peculiarity of the host cells, parental HT1080 cells expressing the doxycycline-regulated transcriptional activator tTA (HTET) (25.Carpenter A.J. Porter A.C.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 5700-5711Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) were transfected with plasmids (pTetCDK1-WT-HA-zeo and pTetCDK1-AF-HA-zeo) carrying an expression cassette for zeocin resistance (zeor) and tTA-responsive expression cassette for Cdk1-WT-HA or Cdk1-AF-HA (Fig. 3A). After transfection of pTetCDK1-WT-HA-zeo, induction of Cdk1-WT-HA expression by removal of Dox increased the frequency of zeocin-resistant colonies recovered (Table 2). This result can be explained if induction of the tTA binding to the promoter/enhancer driving Cdk1-WT-HA expression also enhances expression of the zeor cassette. After transfection of pTetCDK1-AF-HA-zeo, however, induction of Cdk1-AF-HA expression decreased the frequency of zeor colonies recovered (Table 2). Furthermore, immunoblotting of zeor colonies selected and expanded in the absence of doxycycline (i.e. while CDK1-WT-HA or CDK1-AF-HA cassettes were expressed) showed the former to express detectable, although variable, levels of Cdk1-WT-HA, whereas the latter expressed no detectable Cdk1-AF-HA (Fig. 3B). Expression of Cdk1-AF-HA could nevertheless be detected in immunoblots of zeor clones selected and expanded in the presence of doxycycline (i.e. to suppress expression from CDK1-WT-HA or CDK1-AF-HA cassettes) and then grown without doxycycline for 5 days (Fig. 3C), during which time cells appeared normal and continued to proliferate. Together, these observations suggest that HT1080 cells expressing physiological levels of Cdk1-AF-HA are able to proliferate effectively but that they are at a selective disadvantage and gradually outgrown by derivatives in which Cdk1-AF-HA expression is suppressed. The persistent expression of Cdk-AF-HA in HT2-19 derivatives selected in the absence of IPTG is therefore evidence that, under these conditions, Cdk-AF-HA confers a selective advantage.TABLE 2Transfection to zeocin resistance with or without CDK1 expressionPlasmidnaNumber of HTET cells electroporated (×10-6).Zeor coloniesRatioWith doxycyclineWithout doxycyclineExperiment 1pTetCDK1-WT-HA-zeo1587710961.25pTetCDK1-AF-HA-zeo155013410.68Experiment 2pTetCDK1-WT-HA-zeo7.53383491.03pTetCDK1-AF-HA-zeo7.592390.42Experiment 3pTetCDK1-WT-HA-zeo7.51291431.11pTetCDK1-AF-HA-zeo7.52150.24AvpTetCDK1-WT-HA-zeo1.13pTetCDK1-AF-HA-zeo0.45a Number of HTET cells electroporated (×10-6). Open table in a new tab Growth of IPTG-independent HT2-19 Clones−Four rescued clones (WT2, WT3, AF18, and AF29) were selected for further analysis. All but WT2 reproducibly grew faster and formed colonies more efficiently when IPTG was restored to the medium (Fig. 4, A and B). This implied that for such clones there is a selective advantage in the absence of IPTG to any cells that up-regulate their endogenous Cdk1 expression, something we knew HT2-19 cells were capable of doing at low frequencies (19.Itzhaki J.E. Gilbert C.S. Porter A.C.G. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 258-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). This may explain why endogenous Cdk1 expression in some clones had already lost IPTG dependence at the time of first analysis (e.g. clones WT1 and AF22; Fig. 1). It may also explain why we found that clones such as AF18, whose endogenous Cdk1 was still IPTG-dependent when first isolated (Fig. 1), had lost this dependence in later passages (Fig. 4C). The fact that expression of exogenous Cdk1-AF-HA is maintained in clones such as AF18, despite evidence that its expression in HT1080 cells is selectively disadvantageous (Fig. 3), suggests that exogenous Cdk1 activity remains advantageous to HT2-19 cells even when endogenous Cdk1 is expressed. This is consistent with the fact that, even in the presence of IPTG, the cell doubling time and amount of Cdk1 protein are both reduced in HT2-19 compared with parental HT1080 cells (19.Itzhaki J.E. Gilbert C.S. Porter A.C.G. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 258-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Cdk1-AF-HA-rescued Clones Depend on Residual Endogenous Cdk1−Based on the considerations above, it was apparent that residual endogenous Cdk1 expression in the absence of IPTG, even when insufficient to support HT2-19 viability, might cooperate with exogenous Cdk1 to rescue HT2-19 cells. We therefore wanted to know whether residual endogenous Cdk1 expression was required for Cdk1-AF-HA (but not Cdk1-WT-HA) to rescue HT2-19 cells from IPTG dependence. To test this, we attempted to disrupt the IPTG-regulated CDK1 allele in clone AF18 by use of a gene targeting construct (pCDCzeo) analogous to that used previously to disrupt the other allele (19.Itzhaki J.E. Gilbert C.S. Porter A.C.G. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 258-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) but with a different selectable marker. Approximately 1000 drug-resistant transfectants were screened by PCR for disruption, but of the three PCR-positive clones identified, none had targeted the IPTG-regulated allele (see “Experimental Procedures”). We therefore used a short interfering RNA (siRNACDK1) designed to silence expression of endogenous CDK1 without affecting expression of the genes encoding HA-tagged Cdk1 (Fig. 5A). Immunoblot analyses of HT2-19, WT4, and AF18 cells transfected with either siRNACDK1 or a control siRNA confirmed that endogenous but not exogenous Cdk1 was depleted by siRNACDK1 (Fig. 5B), despite the appearance, for unknown reasons, of a nonspecific band (stars). The effects of siRNACDK1 on cell appearance, proliferation, and ploidy were assessed and found to be different for each cell line (Fig. 6). HT2-19 cells grown in IPTG and treated with siRNAC"
