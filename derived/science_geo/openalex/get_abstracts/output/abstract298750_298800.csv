https://openalex.org/W1966081590,"The species richness (diversity) of local plant and animal assemblages-biological communities-balances regional processes of species formation and geographic dispersal, which add species to communities, against processes of predation, competitive exclusion, adaptation, and stochastic variation, which may promote local extinction. During the past three decades, ecologists have sought to explain differences in local diversity by the influence of the physical environment on local interactions among species, interactions that are generally believed to limit the number of coexisting species. But diversity of the biological community often fails to converge under similar physical conditions, and local diversity bears a demonstrable dependence upon regional diversity. These observations suggest that regional and historical processes, as well as unique events and circumstances, profoundly influence local community structure. Ecologists must broaden their concepts of community processes and incorporate data from systematics, biogeography, and paleontology into analyses of ecological patterns and tests of community theory."
https://openalex.org/W2079718877,"Band-gap engineering is a powerful technique for the design of new semiconductor materials and devices. Heterojunctions and modern growth techniques, such as molecular beam epitaxy, allow band diagrams with nearly arbitrary and continuous band-gap variations to be made. The transport properties of electrons and holes can be independently and continuously tuned for a given application. A new generation of devices with unique capabilities, ranging from solid-state photomultipliers to resonant tunneling transistors, is emerging from this approach."
https://openalex.org/W2008933241,"Development and implementation of local and regional plans to control nonpoint sources of pollution from agricultural land are major mandates of section 208 of Public Law 92-500. Many planners tend to equate erosion control as measured by the universal soil loss equation with improvements in water quality. Others implement channel management practices which degrade rather than improve water quality and thereby decrease the effectiveness of other efforts to control nonpoint sources. Planners rarely recognize the importance of the land-water interface in regulating water quality in agricultural watersheds. More effective planning can result from the development of ""best management systems"" which incorporate theory from all relevant disciplines."
https://openalex.org/W2031197130,"Juvenile hormone (JH) has central roles in the regulation of insect development and reproduction but has not previously been identified in other arthropod classes. The hemolymph of a crustacean, Libinia emarginata (Leach), has now been analyzed for JH-like compounds. Samples contained 0.003 to 0.030 nanogram of JH III per milliliter and 10 to 50 nanograms of methyl farnesoate per milliliter; methyl farnesoate is a compound structurally related to JH III that has JH bioactivity. Several tissues were examined for synthesis and secretion of JH-like compounds. Of these tissues, only the mandibular organs produced and secreted JH III and methyl farnesoate. However, microchemical analysis revealed that this JH III was racemic, and thus likely an artifactual oxidation product of methyl farnesoate. Secretion of methyl farnesoate was related to reproduction in females, with the highest rates observed in Libinia near the end of the ovarian cycle when oocyte growth and vitellogenesis are greatest. These results indicate that JH-like compounds such as methyl farnesoate have regulatory roles in crustaceans."
https://openalex.org/W2078402687,"A method based on measurements of dissolved molecular nitrogen, molecular oxygen, and argon can distinguish biological from physical contributions to oxygen supersaturation in the ocean. The derived values of biological O2 production can be used as a check on estimates of total organic productivity measured by instantaneous rates of carbon-14 assimilation. Application to the shallow summer O2 maxima in the North Pacific gyres shows that about 72% of the O2 supersaturation maximum at 28°N and about 86% of the maximum at 40°N are due to net photosynthetic production."
https://openalex.org/W2023412925,The suitability of the lateral line system of fish and aquatic amphibia for the detection of planktonic prey was examined in the antarctic fish Pagothenia borchgrevinki (family Nototheniidae). The best responses of primary afferent lateral line neurons to waterborne vibrations were recorded at frequencies within the range of those produced by swimming crustacea. Simultaneous recordings from a swimming zooplankter held close to the fish and from primary afferent neurons provided direct confirmation that swimming movements of crustaceans are a potent natural stimulus of the lateral line system.
https://openalex.org/W3022479170,"Fundamental investigations of the chemical and physical properties of metal β-diketonate complexes have revealed unusual volatility, as well as solvolytic and thermal stability and solubility in organic solvents. Certain general rules describing the volatility of metal β-diketonates on the basis of ligand shell character and metal ion size have arisen from extensive gas chromatographic and vapor pressure studies. Several practical applications of volatile β-diketonates teke advantage of their special properties. In ultratrace metal analysis by gas chromatography, use of these chelates has allowed the detection of smaller amounts of certain metals than can be detected by any other analytic method. Certain rare earth β-diketonates have been found useful as antiknock additives in gasoline and as catalysts for the removal of carbonaceous deposits from the combustion chambers of internal combustion engines."
https://openalex.org/W1981803171,"The locations of a large number of earthquakes recorded at Rabaul caldera in Papua New Guinea from late 1983 to mid-1985 have produced a picture of this active caldera's structural boundary. The earthquake epicenters form an elliptical annulus about 10 kilometers long by 4 kilometers wide, centered in the southern part of the Rabaul volcanic complex. A set of events with well-constrained depth determinations shows a ring-fault structure that extends from the surface to a depth of about 4 kilometers and slopes steeply outward from the center of the caldera. This is the first geophysical data set that clearly outlines the orientation of an active caldera's bounding faults. This orientation, however, conflicts with the configuration of many other calderas and is not in keeping with currently preferred models of caldera formation."
https://openalex.org/W2013796601,"Central to our understanding of the species concept is knowledge of the nature and evolution of reproductive isolating mechanisms. The once widely accepted model of Dobzhansky, which holds that isolation evolves through selection against hybrids of differentially adapted populations, is now largely rejected. This rejection is due to both theoretical difficulties and a paucity of examples of the predicted pattern of reproductive character displacement. From a survey of five families of Lepidoptera, entailing more than 800 species, evidence is given that male courtship pheromones have evolved within the context of sexual isolation as an adaptive response to mating mistakes between differentially adapted populations; however, distinct from the natural selection model of Dobzhansky, this report suggests the mechanism for change to be sexual selection."
https://openalex.org/W2060316073,"An anomalous topographic high located close to the intersection of the Owen Fracture Zone with the Mid-Indian Ridge exposes exclusively ultramafic rocks for a thickness of more than 2 kilometers. The rocks, consisting of partly serpentinized spinel lherzolites, with minor harzburgites and dunites, display protogranular to porphyroclastic fabrics, but no cumulate textures. The chemistry of olivine, ortho- and clinopyroxene, and spinel crystals suggests that the rocks originated at a depth of at least 25 kilometers in the oceanic lithosphere and were partially reequilibrated and recrystallized during subsequent upwelling. Thus, field, textural, and mineral chemistry data indicate the presence of an uplifted block of upper mantle. The considerable vertical uplift can be explained by a two-stage process: mantle upwelling in the axial zone of plate accretion, followed by vertical tectonic uplift along the fracture zone. The rate of uplift in the fracture zone was of the order of 1 millimeter per year."

It demands even more of human credulity that the cloth bears a photographic likeness which would seem to be that of Jesus as he lay in the tomb. [From The Shroud of Turin by IAN WILSON]."
https://openalex.org/W1973222180,"To test whether a catastrophic earthquake could affect an active magma system, mean abundances (adjusted for ""olivine control"") of titanium, potassium, phosphorus, strontium, zirconium, and niobium of historic lavas erupted from Mauna Loa Volcano, Hawaii, after 1868 were analyzed and were found to decrease sharply relative to lavas erupted before 1868. This abrupt change in lava chemistry, accompanied by a halved lava-production rate for Mauna Loa after 1877, is interpreted to reflect the disruptive effects of a magnitude 7.5 earthquake in 1868. This interpretation represents a documentable case of changes in magmatic chemical variations initiated or accelerated by a major tectonic event."

https://openalex.org/W1993165552,"Seismologists attending last month's meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco heard much about how the irregularities on faults control their behavior and thus the generation of earthquakes. The identification of small crucial areas of a fault, such as the strong spot where a rupture can begin or the fault jog where it can end, is proving a challenge, but it also offers one of the best hopes of understanding and predicting fault behavior."
