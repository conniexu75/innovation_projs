https://openalex.org/W2016709145,"The years 1995 to 2000 experienced the highest level of North Atlantic hurricane activity in the reliable record. Compared with the generally low activity of the previous 24 years (1971 to 1994), the past 6 years have seen a doubling of overall activity for the whole basin, a 2.5-fold increase in major hurricanes (≥50 meters per second), and a fivefold increase in hurricanes affecting the Caribbean. The greater activity results from simultaneous increases in North Atlantic sea-surface temperatures and decreases in vertical wind shear. Because these changes exhibit a multidecadal time scale, the present high level of hurricane activity is likely to persist for an additional ∼10 to 40 years. The shift in climate calls for a reevaluation of preparedness and mitigation strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2108360478,"The 2,160,837–base pair genome sequence of an isolate of Streptococcus pneumoniae , a Gram-positive pathogen that causes pneumonia, bacteremia, meningitis, and otitis media, contains 2236 predicted coding regions; of these, 1440 (64%) were assigned a biological role. Approximately 5% of the genome is composed of insertion sequences that may contribute to genome rearrangements through uptake of foreign DNA. Extracellular enzyme systems for the metabolism of polysaccharides and hexosamines provide a substantial source of carbon and nitrogen for S. pneumoniae and also damage host tissues and facilitate colonization. A motif identified within the signal peptide of proteins is potentially involved in targeting these proteins to the cell surface of low–guanine/cytosine (GC) Gram-positive species. Several surface-exposed proteins that may serve as potential vaccine candidates were identified. Comparative genome hybridization with DNA arrays revealed strain differences in S. pneumoniae that could contribute to differences in virulence and antigenicity."
https://openalex.org/W2018276910,"Microorganisms living in anoxic marine sediments consume more than 80% of the methane produced in the world's oceans. In addition to single-species aggregates, consortia of metabolically interdependent bacteria and archaea are found in methane-rich sediments. A combination of fluorescence in situ hybridization and secondary ion mass spectrometry shows that cells belonging to one specific archaeal group associated with the Methanosarcinales were all highly depleted in 13 C (to values of –96‰). This depletion indicates assimilation of isotopically light methane into specific archaeal cells. Additional microbial species apparently use other carbon sources, as indicated by significantly higher 13 C/ 12 C ratios in their cell carbon. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of simultaneous determination of the identity and the metabolic activity of naturally occurring microorganisms."

Here we report measurement of residual dipolar couplings in denatured forms of the small protein staphylococcal nuclease oriented in strained polyacrylamide gels. A highly significant correlation among the dipolar couplings for individual residues suggests that a native-like spatial positioning and orientation of chain segments (topology) persists to concentrations of at least 8 molar urea. These data demonstrate that long-range ordering can occur well before a folding protein attains a compact conformation, a conclusion not anticipated by any of the standard models of protein folding."
https://openalex.org/W2314325548,"Since the NF-κB/relA transcription factor is constitutively activated in human prostate cancer cells, we determined whether blocking NF-κB/relA activity in human prostate cancer cells affected their angiogenesis, growth, and metastasis in an orthotopic nude mouse model. Highly metastatic PC-3M human prostate cancer cells were transfected with a mutated IκBα (IκBαM), which blocks NF-κB activity. Parental (PC-3M), control vector-transfected (PC-3M-Neo), and IκBαM-transfected (PC-3M–IκBαM) cells were injected into the prostate gland of nude mice. PC-3M and PC-3M-Neo cells produced rapidly growing tumors and regional lymph node metastasis, whereas PC-3M–IκBαM cells produced slow growing tumors with low metastatic potential. NF-κB signaling blockade significantly inhibited in vitro and in vivo expression of three major proangiogenic molecules, VEGF, IL-8, and MMP-9, and hence decreased neoplastic angiogenesis. Inhibition of NF-κB activity in PC-3M cells also resulted in the downregulation of MMP-9 mRNA and collagenase activity, resulting in decreased invasion through Matrigel. Collectively, these data suggest that blockade of NF-κB activity in PC-3M cells inhibits angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2087895844,"The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has recently released its Third Assessment Report (TAR), in which new projections are given for global-mean warming in the absence of policies to limit climate change. The full warming range over 1990 to 2100, 1.4 degrees to 5.8 degrees C, is substantially higher than the range given previously in the IPCC Second Assessment Report. Here we interpret the new warming range in probabilistic terms, accounting for uncertainties in emissions, the climate sensitivity, the carbon cycle, ocean mixing, and aerosol forcing. We show that the probabilities of warming values at both the high and low ends of the TAR range are very low. In the absence of climate-mitigation policies, the 90% probability interval for 1990 to 2100 warming is 1.7 degrees to 4.9 degrees C."
https://openalex.org/W2096881442,"The ability of transcriptional activation domains (TADs) to signal ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis suggests an involvement of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in transcription. To probe this involvement, we asked how ubiquitylation regulates the activity of a transcription factor containing the VP16 TAD. We show that the VP16 TAD signals ubiquitylation through the Met30 ubiquitin-ligase and that Met30 is also required for the VP16 TAD to activate transcription. The requirement for Met30 in transcription is circumvented by fusion of ubiquitin to the VP16 activator, demonstrating that activator ubiquitylation is essential for transcriptional activation. We propose that ubiquitylation regulates TAD function by serving as a dual signal for activation and activator destruction."
https://openalex.org/W2064208521,"Cyclopentenone prostaglandins display anti-inflammatory activities and interfere with the signaling pathway that leads to activation of transcription factor NF-κB. Here we explore the possibility that the NF-κB subunit p50 may be a target for the cyclopentenone 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2(15d-PGJ2). This prostaglandin inhibited the DNA binding ability of recombinant p50 in a dose-dependent manner. The inhibition required the cyclopentenone moiety and could be prevented but not reverted by glutathione and dithiothreitol. Moreover, a p50 mutant with a C62S mutation was resistant to inhibition, indicating that the effect of 15d-PGJ2 was probably due to its interaction with cysteine 62 in p50. The covalent modification of p50 by 15d-PGJ2 was demonstrated by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry analysis that showed an increase in retention time and in the molecular mass of 15d-PGJ2-treated p50, respectively. The interaction between p50 and 15d-PGJ2 was relevant in intact cells. 15d-PGJ2 effectively inhibited cytokine-elicited NF-κB activity in HeLa without reducing IκBα degradation or nuclear translocation of NF-κB subunits. 15d-PGJ2 reduced NF-κB DNA binding activity in isolated nuclear extracts, suggesting a direct effect on NF-κB proteins. Finally, treatment of HeLa with biotinylated-15d-PGJ2 resulted in the formation of a 15d-PGJ2-p50 adduct as demonstrated by neutravidin binding and immunoprecipitation. These results clearly show that p50 is a target for covalent modification by 15d-PGJ2 that results in inhibition of DNA binding.

It is involved in the induction of numerous pro-inflammatory genes including iNOS, COX-2, adhesion molecules, and cytokines (1Baeuerle P.A. Baichwal V.R. Adv. Immunol. 1997; 65: 111-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Pahl H.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6853-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (3448) Google Scholar). Its ability to rapidly elicit transcriptional responses to pro-inflammatory stimuli relies in its property of being presynthesized in the cytoplasm of cells but kept inactive by the binding of the inhibitory subunit, IκB. Pro-inflammatory stimuli such as IL-1 or TNF trigger a cascade of events that leads to the activation of the kinase complex IKK, or IκB-kinase (3Baeuerle P.A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R19-R22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Karin M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6867-6874Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of IκB by IKK drives the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of IκB by the proteasome. The active NF-κB dimer, integrated by two members of the NF-κB/Rel family of proteins (5Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4609) Google Scholar), is thus free to translocate to the nucleus where it activates transcription. Additional regulation of NF-κB activity may occur through the posttranslational modification of NF-κB subunits, which may imply phosphorylation of p65 (6Zhong H. Yang H.S. Erdjument-Bromage H.

Inflammatory conditions such as psoriasis, ulcerative colitis, and allergic eczema are associated with elevated levels of prostaglandins (PG). The up-regulation of COX-2 plays a key role in the overproduction of prostanoids associated with inflammatory situations (14Seibert K. Zhang Y. Leahy K. Hauser S. Masferrer J. Perkins W. Lee L. Isakson P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12013-12017Crossref PubMed Scopus (1460) Google Scholar, 15Crofford L.J. Wilder R.L. Ristimaki A.P. Sano H. Remmers E.F. Epps H.R. Hla T. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1095-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Pro-inflammatory PG, such as PGE2 produced at the early stages of COX-2 expression, mediate vasodilatation, bone resorption, and fever (16Appleton I. Tomlinson A. Willoughby D.A. Adv. Pharmacol. 1996; 35: 27-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, recent evidences indicate that COX-2 may play a dual role in inflammation, promoting at later stages the production of cyclopentenone PG, such as PGA2 and 15-deoxy-Δ12–14-PGJ2 (15d-PGJ2), that may favor resolution of inflammation (17Gilroy D.W. Colville-Nash P.R. Willis D. Chivers J. Paul-Clark M.J. Willoughby D.A. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 698-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar). Cyclopentenone PG display singular biological activities, including inhibition of cell proliferation, induction of apoptosis, and inhibition of viral replication (18Fukushima M. Kato T. Narumiya S.

FEBS Lett. 1993; 321: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The COX metabolite 15d-PGJ2, is a negative modulator of cell activation by pro-inflammatory stimuli that inhibits the NF-κB activation pathway acting at multiple levels (20Ricote M. Li A.C. Willson T.M. Kelly C.J. Glass C.K. Nature. 1998; 391: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (3260) Google Scholar, 21Petrova T.V. Akama K.T. Eldik L.J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4668-4673Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). 15d-PGJ2 acts as a ligand for the nuclear receptor PPARγ, which in turn may inhibit NF-κB by sequestering co-activators needed for transcription (22Li M. Pascual G. Glass C.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4699-4707Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). In addition, 15d-PGJ2 can directly inhibit NF-κB activation either by blocking IKK activity (23Castrillo A. Dı́az-Guerra M.J. Hortelano S. Martı́n-Sanz P. Boscá L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1692-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), possibly through covalent modifications of critical cysteine residues in IKKβ (24Rossi A. Kapahi P. Natoli G. Takahashi T. Chen Y. Karin M. Santoro M.G. Nature. 2000; 403: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (1203) Google Scholar) or by interacting with a cysteine residue in the DNA-binding domain of the NF-κB subunit p65 (25Straus D.S. Pascual G. Li M. Welch J.S. Ricote M. Hsiang C.H. Sengchanthalangsy L.L. Ghosh G. Glass C.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4844-4849Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). These mechanisms may act in combination to inhibit transactivation of NF-κB target genes, including COX-2and iNOS, thus exerting a negative feedback on inflammatory processes (26Inoue H. Tanabe T. Umesono K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28028-28032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 27Hortelano S. Castrillo A. Alvarez A.M. Boscá L. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 6525-6531Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). These findings have lead to propose that cyclopentenone PG may be useful as anti-inflammatory agents. However, despite numerous studies on the cellular effects of NF-κB inhibition by 15d-PGJ2, the nature of the interaction between 15d-PGJ2 and NF-κB proteins has not been fully characterized. The NF-κB subunit p50 possesses a critical cysteine residue in its DNA binding domain. This cysteine (Cys-62 in human p50) has been proposed to be the target for inhibition of NF-κB DNA binding activity by NO, either through S-nitrosylation (11Mathews J.R. Botting C.H. Panico M. Morris H.R. Hay R.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2236-2242Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar) or NO-induced S-glutathionylation (28Klatt P. Pineda-Molina E. Pérez-Sala D. Lamas S. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 567-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and to mediate the effect of redox changes on NF-κB activity (12Toledano M.B. Ghosh D. Trinh F. Leonard W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 852-860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, a potential role of p50 as a target for the inhibitory actions of cyclopentenone PG on the NF-κB pathway could be hypothesized. Our results show that p50 is a target for covalent modification by 15d-PGJ2, both in vitro and in intact cells, and that this interaction results in the inhibition of NF-κB binding to DNA. 15-Deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2 was from Calbiochem-Novabiochem. 15-Deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2 (mixture of isomers), carbaprostacyclin, PGE2, and PGA1 were from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). Recombinant human IL-1β (5 × 10 7 units/mg) was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Recombinant human TNF-α was from Serotec (Oxford, United Kingdom). Rabbit antisera against human p50 and p65 proteins were a generous gift of Dr. Nancy Rice (NCI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD,). Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulins were from Dako (Glostrup, Denmark). Polyclonal anti-IκBα (sc-371) and anti-p50, agarose conjugate (sc-1190AC), were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The recombinant wild type and mutant DNA binding domains of human p50 (amino acids 36–385, GenBankTM accession number M55643) were expressed in Escherichiae coli as hexahistidine fusion proteins and purified as described (28Klatt P. Pineda-Molina E. Pérez-Sala D. Lamas S. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 567-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This construct will be referred to as p50. GSH was from Sigma. Diisopropylcarbodiimide, EZ-link 5-(biotinamido)pentylamine and Ultralink-Immobilized NeutrAvidin-Plus were from Pierce. HRP-conjugated streptavidin was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Cell culture media and supplements were from Life Technologies, Inc. HeLa cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. For experiments cells were incubated in RPMI with the indicated agents in the absence of serum. Potential toxicity of the reagents used was evaluated by trypan blue exclusion. According to these criteria, cell viability was above 90% under all experimental conditions studied. Nuclear and cytosolic extracts were obtained as previously described in detail (29Dı́az-Cazorla M. Pérez-Sala D. Lamas S. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 943-952PubMed Google Scholar). Protein content was determined using the BCA protein assay from Pierce for cytosolic extracts and the Bradford protein assay from Bio-Rad (Munich, Germany) for nuclear extracts. Purified wild type or mutant p50 in 20 mmTris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.7 μm2-mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, were incubated with prostaglandins or vehicle for 2 h at 37 °C before being analyzed by EMSA or HPLC. Prostaglandins were added in Me2SO. Final Me2SO concentration was 1% (v/v). This Me2SO concentration did not interfere with EMSA. For in vitro treatments of nuclear extracts with 15d-PGJ2, 3.5 μg of nuclear proteins in 20 mmHepes, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 0.25 mm EDTA, 0.125 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm DTT, 20% (v/v) glycerol plus 1 μg/ml protease inhibitors (leupeptin, pepstatin, antipain) were incubated with prostaglandins for 1 h at room temperature. Final Me2SO concentration was kept below 0.6% (v/v). p50 incubated in the absence or presence of 15d-PGJ2 was diluted (2:1) with 8n guanidinium chloride and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, injected into a reverse-phase HPLC column (Vydac 218TP5415) equilibrated with solvent A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid), and eluted with a gradient of 0 to 100% eluant B (90% acetonitrile in solvent A). Fractions containing p50 were pooled and concentrated by evaporation. 0.5 μl of the fractions to be analyzed were applied onto target and dried out along with 0.5 μl of saturated α-ciano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix in water:acetonitrile (1:1) containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Mass spectrometry analysis by MALDI-TOF was performed using a Reflex II instrument (Bruker, Bremen, Germany), operating in reflectron mode. Calibration was performed externally using bovine serum albumin and control p50 as standards. Sense and antisense oligonucleotides corresponding to the upstream NF-κB site from the human COX-2 promoter (5′-GGAGAGGGGATTCCCTGCG-3′), located at −452 to −433 bases from the transcriptional start site, were annealed and labeled by incubation with [α-32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as previously described (29Dı́az-Cazorla M. Pérez-Sala D. Lamas S. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 943-952PubMed Google Scholar). Two ng of the labeled double stranded oligonucleotide (∼20,000 cpm) were used per binding reaction. For EMSA of purified p50, 15 nm wild type or C62S mutant p50 treated with vehicle or cyclopentenone PG were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in the presence of labeled oligonucleotide, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) carrier in binding buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40). For EMSA of nuclear proteins, binding reactions containing 3.5 μg of nuclear extract were carried out for 20 min on ice. Unless otherwise stated, DTT final concentration was 0.1 mm. Protein-DNA complexes were separated by electrophoresis on a non-denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography. For competition experiments, a 200-fold excess of unlabeled NF-κB oligonucleotide or of an unrelated oligonucleotide of sequence 5′-GGG CTT GAT GAG TCA GCC GGA CC-3′ were added to the binding reaction to ensure the specificity of the NF-κB-DNA complexes. The intensity of the complexes formed was quantitated by densitometry of the autoradiographic exposures of gels. Levels of p65 and p50 proteins in nuclear extracts and of IκBα present in the cytosolic fraction of HeLa were assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblot as previously described (29Dı́az-Cazorla M. Pérez-Sala D. Lamas S. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 943-952PubMed Google Scholar). The carboxyl group of 15d-PGJ2 was modified by amidation with EZ-link 5-(biotinamido)pentylamine by a modification of a previously described procedure (30Parker J. Prostaglandins. 1996; 50: 359-375Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 mg of 15d-PGJ2 (isomer mixture containing 90–95% of thetrans, cis-Δ12, 14 isomer) was made to react with 1 mg of (5-biotinamido)pentylamine in the presence of the condensing agent diisopropylcarbodiimide. The reaction was carried out overnight at room temperature in acetonitrile. Biotinylated 15d-PGJ2 was then extracted with ethyl acetate and purified through a silica gel column eluted with ethyl acetate:methanol (9:1). The recovery of biotinylated PG was estimated as 50% according to the instructions of the manufacturer for the determination of biotin. The modified PG was then dried under argon and dissolved in Me2SO for further use. HeLa cells at 50% confluence were incubated with 10 μm biotinylated 15d-PGJ2 for 2 h. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, harvested and lysed in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.5% SDS, 0.1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, plus protease inhibitors. Cell lysates containing 200 μg of protein were incubated batch-wise with 50 μl of NeutrAvidin-Plus beads for 1 h at 4 °C with constant shaking. Beads were washed five times with lysis buffer by centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 1 min. Proteins were eluted by incubating the beads in 0.05 n NaOH for 1 min at room temperature to hydrolyze the protein-PG linkage (31Narumiya S. Ohno K. Fukushima M. Fujiwara M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1987; 242: 306-311PubMed Google Scholar,32Noyori R. Suzuki M. Science. 1993; 259: 44-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by immunodetection with anti-p50 antibody. In addition, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with agarose-conjugated anti-p50 antibody according to the manufacturer's instructions, and biotinylated proteins were subjected to Western blot and detection with HRP-conjugated streptavidin and ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To test the hypothesis that p50 may be a target for the inhibitory effect of 15d-PGJ2 on NF-κB activity we first studied the interaction between 15d-PGJ2 and p50 in vitro. Treatment of purified p50 with 15d-PGJ2 strongly inhibited its ability to bind DNA as determined by EMSA (Fig.1). This effect was dose-dependent. Concentrations of the prostaglandin as low as 1 μm were sufficient to cause a significant inhibition (p < 0.05, n = 4). The potency of the inhibition was also proportional to the time of pre-incubation of p50 with 15d-PGJ2. The structural requirements for the inhibition by 15d-PGJ2 were explored by studying the effect of several PG on p50 DNA binding (Fig.2). Of the compounds tested, 15d-PGJ2 caused the most potent inhibitory effect. PGA1 moderately interfered with p50 DNA binding while PGE2 and carbaprostacyclin (cPGI2) were virtually ineffective. The detoxification of PG in cells may involve conjugation with GSH (33Atsmon J. Freeman M.L. Meredith M.J. Sweetman B.J. Roberts L.J., II. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 1879-1885PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore studied the ability of GSH to prevent the inhibitory effect of 15d-PGJ2 in vitro by adding GSH before or after treatment of p50 with 15d-PGJ2, as depicted in Fig.3 A. Treatment of p50 with 15d-PGJ2 in the absence of GSH induced a 50% inhibition of DNA binding (Fig. 3 A, lanes 1 and 2). However, incubation of 15d-PGJ2 with 3 mm GSH prior to addition of p50 strongly diminished the inhibitory effect (8% inhibition, Fig. 3 A, compare lanes 3 and4). In contrast, addition of GSH after incubation of p50 with 15d-PGJ2 was not able to fully restore DNA binding activity (39% inhibition persisted in this case; Fig. 3 A, compare lanes 5 and 6). As expected based on previous observations (34Mihm S. Galter D. Dröge W. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 246-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), in all incubations containing GSH, the overall DNA binding activity of p50 was improved. These results suggest that GSH may prevent but not revert the inhibitory effect of 15d-PGJ2 on p50 DNA binding. We next explored whether DTT could exert a protective effect similar to that of GSH. Incubation of p50 with 15d-PGJ2 in the presence of DTT reduced the potency of the inhibition in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3 B). The extent of inhibition of p50-DNA complex formation was reduced from 81% when p50 had been pre-incubated with 15d-PGJ2 in the absence of DTT (lanes 1 and 2) to 63% when 0.1 mmDTT had been included in the pre-incubation mixture (lanes 3and 4). In both cases EMSA was performed in the presence of 0.1 mm DTT, which was not sufficient to revert the inhibition. When 1 mm DTT was used throughout the experiment, the inhibitory effect of 15d-PGJ2 was completely prevented (Fig. 3 B, lanes 5 and6). These results suggest that the inhibitory effect of 15d-PGJ2 may arise from its interaction with cysteine residues in p50. The p50 DNA binding domain contains a cysteine residue that has been proposed to be a target for redox regulation (12Toledano M.B. Ghosh D. Trinh F. Leonard W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 852-860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore explored whether this cysteine was important for the effect of 15d-PGJ2. As it can be observed in Fig.4, the DNA binding ability of a p50 mutant in which Cys-62 was substituted by serine was virtually unaffected by 15d-PGJ2 treatment. These results suggest that 15d-PGJ2 may inhibit p50 DNA binding by interacting with Cys-62. To gain insight into the interaction between 15d-PGJ2 and p50 we first subjected the protein to reverse-phase HPLC analysis (Fig.5 A). Control p50 eluted as a single peak with a retention time of 43.7 min. 15d-PGJ2-treated p50 eluted in a major peak with a retention time of 44.5 min and several minor peaks. In contrast, the HPLC elution profile of the C62S p50 mutant did not vary significantly after treatment with 15d-PGJ2 (Fig. 5 A,right panel). The fractions corresponding to the major peaks from control and 15d-PGJ2-treated wild type p50 were subsequently analyzed by mass spectrometry. The MALDI-TOF spectrum of control p50 showed a peak of m/z = 40,600, which corresponds to the calculated molecular mass of the p50 construct used, together with peaks of m/z = 20,300 (doubly charged) and 81,230 (Fig. 5 B, lower panel). The spectrum of 15d-PGJ2-treated p50 showed peaks of m/z = 41,241,m/z = 20,618 (doubly charged), which are compatible with the formation of a covalent adduct between one molecule of p50 and two molecules of 15d-PGJ2 (expectedm/z 41,232 and 20,616 respectively), and a peak of m/z = 82,526 (Fig. 5 B,upper panel). These results show that 15d-PGJ2covalently modifies p50. We were then interested in assessing the relevance of cyclopentenone PG modification of p50 in cells. For this purpose we first explored the effect of 15d-PGJ2 on cytokine-elicited NF-κB activation in intact cells. Treatment of HeLa with 15d-PGJ2 before stimulation with IL-1β plus TNF-α clearly reduced NF-κB activity in nuclear extracts as determined by EMSA (Fig. 6 A). However, the inhibition of NF-κB DNA binding activity did not correlate with a reduction in the nuclear levels of p65 and p50 subunits, suggesting that NF-κB activation was not impaired in 15d-PGJ2-treated cells. This was confirmed by the observation that 15d-PGJ2 did not interfere with the phosphorylation of IκBα as estimated from the appearance of a slower migrating form or with the degradation of IκBα protein in response to cytokine treatment (Fig. 6 B). These observations indicate that in intact HeLa cells, the direct inhibition of the DNA binding ability of nuclear NF-κB may be the main mechanism by which 15d-PGJ2 interferes with NF-κB activity. To assess if inhibition of NF-κB DNA binding elicited by 15d-PGJ2 in HeLa could be due to the covalent modification of p50 we prepared a biotinylated 15d-PGJ2 analog and studied its interaction with p50 both in isolated nuclear extracts and in intact cells. Both 15d-PGJ2 and biotinylated 15d-PGJ2 directly inhibited the DNA binding of the native NF-κB dimers present in nuclear extracts isolated from IL-1β/TNF-α-stimulated HeLa, although the biotinylated PG was slightly less effective (Fig.7 A). To demonstrate the modification of p50 by cyclopentenone PG in intact cells, HeLa were treated with biotinylated 15d-PGJ2, and cell lysates were incubated batch-wise with NeutrAvidin beads. After extensive washing, proteins bound to the resin through biotinylated PG were eluted by hydrolysis of the protein-PG linkage with 0.05n NaOH (31Narumiya S. Ohno K. Fukushima M. Fujiwara M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1987; 242: 306-311PubMed Google Scholar), and p50 present in the eluate was detected by immunoblot (Fig. 7 B). Alternatively, cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with an anti-p50 antibody and the presence of biotinylated 15d-PGJ2-modified proteins was assessed by Western blot and detection with HRP-conjugated streptavidin. (Fig. 7 B). These results clearly show that p50 is a target for covalent modification by cyclopentenone PG in intact cells. Cyclopentenone PG display varied biological activities. They have been reported to modulate adipocyte differentiation (35Forman B.M. Tontonoz P. Chen J. Brun R.P. Spiegelman B.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 803-812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2731) Google Scholar), cell proliferation, and apoptosis (19Kim I.K. Lee J.H. Sohn H.W. Kim H.S. Kim S.H. FEBS Lett. 1993; 321: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), heat shock response, and viral replication (36Santoro M.G. Trends Microbiol. 1997; 5: 276-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The mechanisms that mediate these effects may be multiple. Certain cyclopentenone PG, in particular 15d-PGJ2, has been shown to act as an endogenous ligand for the transcription factor PPARγ, causing the activation of this factor that plays key roles in adipocyte differentiation and modulation of inflammation (37Kersten S. Desvergne B. Wahli W. Nature. 2000; 405: 421-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (1665) Google Scholar). In addition, recent evidence points to the occurrence of direct effects of cyclopentenone PG, which are independent from PPARγ. Cyclopentenone PG are reactive compounds that possess an α, β-unsaturated carbonyl group in the cyclopentenone ring. This group may react with sulfhydryl groups of cysteine residues of proteins or of the tripeptide glutathione (38Atsmon J. Sweetman B.J. Baertschi S.W. Harris T.M. Roberts L.J., II. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3760-3765Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). 15d-PGJ2 also has a double bond at position 12 that may participate in these interactions. This PG may also dimerize in solution at pH above 7.4. The formation of adducts between proteins and cyclopentenone PG has been previously reported (30Parker J. Prostaglandins. 1996; 50: 359-375Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 31Narumiya S. Ohno K. Fukushima M. Fujiwara M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1987; 242: 306-311PubMed Google Scholar), although the proteins involved have not been identified. Based on functional evidence, a modification of IKK (24Rossi A. Kapahi P. Natoli G. Takahashi T. Chen Y. Karin M. Santoro M.G. Nature. 2000; 403: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (1203) Google Scholar) and of the p65 subunit of NF-κB (25Straus D.S. Pascual G. Li M. Welch J.S. Ricote M. Hsiang C.H. Sengchanthalangsy L.L. Ghosh G. Glass C.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4844-4849Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar) by 15d-PGJ2 has been proposed. Our results constitute the first biochemical identification of the formation of a covalent adduct between 15d-PGJ2 and a known cellular protein, bothin vitro and in intact cells. The modification of recombinant p50 by 15d-PGJ2 can be evidenced by HPLC analysis by a retardation in the retention time of the protein. Analysis of the corresponding HPLC fractions by mass spectrometry shows a mass increment that is consistent with the addition of two 15d-PGJ2 molecules. This could result from the modification of two cysteine residues in the protein or from the modification of a single cysteine residue by a 15d-PGJ2dimer. Our results do not exactly map the cysteine(s) modified by 15d-PGJ2, although the lack of inhibitory effect of 15d-PGJ2 on the p50 C62S mutant indicates that the modification of this cysteine accounts for the inhibition of DNA binding. Moreover, treatment of this mutant with 15d-PGJ2did not alter its elution profile in reverse phase HLPC analysis. Nevertheless, given the high reactivity of 15d-PGJ2, the modification of p50 at other cysteine residues under our incubation conditions cannot be excluded. Mass spectrometry of a fraction from the HPLC analysis of 15d-PGJ2-treated p50 eluting at 47 min gave a molecular mass of 41,877, which could be compatible with the formation of an adduct between one molecule of p50 and four PG molecules. The formation of adducts between cyclopentenone PG and glutathione has been shown to take place by Michael's addition (38Atsmon J. Sweetman B.J. Baertschi S.W. Harris T.M. Roberts L.J., II. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3760-3765Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This process may be involved in the detoxification of cyclopentenone PG by cells and it can occur both non-enzymatically or, at a higher rate, in a process catalyzed by GST (38Atsmon J. Sweetman B.J. Baertschi S.W. Harris T.M. Roberts L.J., II. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3760-3765Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 39Chen Y. Morrow J.D. Roberts L.J., II. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10863-10868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Here we show that pre-incubation of 15d-PGJ2 with GSH effectively reduces the inhibitory effect of the former on p50 DNA binding. This could be due to the sequestration of the PG in the form of GSH-15d-PGJ2adducts. Interestingly, addition of GSH after treatment of p50 with 15d-PGJ2 did not abolish the inhibitory effect, thus supporting the irreversible nature of the 15d-PGJ2-protein interaction under physiological conditions (32Noyori R. Suzuki M. Science. 1993; 259: 44-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Our results also add biochemical support to evidences pointing out the importance of cellular GSH levels and/or GST activity in determining the susceptibility to the inhibitory effects of 15d-PGJ2 (25Straus D.S. Pascual G. Li M. Welch J.S. Ricote M. Hsiang C.H. Sengchanthalangsy L.L. Ghosh G. Glass C.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4844-4849Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar,32Noyori R. Suzuki M. Science. 1993; 259: 44-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The modification of p50 by 15d-PGJ2 can be evidenced in intact cells. Several approaches have been previously used to follow the fate of cyclopentenone PG in cells. By using radioactively labeled Δ12-PGJ2 it was shown that this PG was taken up by cells and accumulated into nuclei where it was bound to the protein fraction (31Narumiya S. Ohno K. Fukushima M. Fujiwara M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1987; 242: 306-311PubMed Google Scholar). The labeling of several cellular proteins in the 40- to 60-kDa range was observed by incubating K562 cells with biotinylated PGA2 (30Parker J. Prostaglandins. 1996; 50: 359-375Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We have used biotinylated 15d-PGJ2 to explore the incorporation of this PG into p50. Our results show that biotinylated 15d-PGJ2 displays a similar potency to that of 15d-PGJ2 as inhibitor of p50 DNA binding under in vitro conditions, and that it modifies p50 when added to intact cells. These results raise the possibility that p50 is a target for the anti-inflammatory effects of 15d-PGJ2, at least at the pharmacological doses employed in most biochemical studies. The relevance of the modification of p50 and the inhibition of DNA binding by endogenously generated 15d-PGJ2 remains to be established. In a model of pleurisy in rats, cyclopentenone PG have been shown to reach concentrations between 2.5 and 5 nm in the cell-free inflammatory exudate (17Gilroy D.W. Colville-Nash P.R. Willis D. Chivers J. Paul-Clark M.J. Willoughby D.A. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 698-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar), although no information was available about the intracellular or intranuclear levels. In addition, the formation of reactive cyclopentenone compounds has been documented in vivo, and they have been detected esterified to lipids in the liver of rats in amounts that increased markedly after oxidant injury (up to 600 ng/g) (39Chen Y. Morrow J.D. Roberts L.J., II. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10863-10868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Because cyclopentenone PG tend to accumulate in the nuclei of cells (31Narumiya S. Ohno K. Fukushima M. Fujiwara M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1987; 242: 306-311PubMed Google Scholar), it is possible to speculate that the concentrations of endogenous 15d-PGJ2 reached in cell nuclei under certain pathophysiological conditions might be sufficient to promote the modification of p50. In conclusion, our results identify the p50 subunit of the NF-κB transcription factor as a target for modification by 15d-PGJ2, providing a biochemical basis for some of the anti-inflammatory actions of this PG. In addition, the use of biotinylated 15d-PGJ2 might prove a valuable approach for the identification of other potential targets for the actions of cyclopentenone PG in cells.

Using a combination of Monte Carlo simulations, diffusion reaction theory, and direct experiments (surface force measurements) of the biotin-streptavidin system, we have quantified polymer chain dynamics and the kinetics and spatial range of tethered ligand-receptor binding. The results show that the efficiency of strong binding does not depend solely on the molecular architecture or binding energy of the receptor-ligand pair, nor on the equilibrium configuration of the polymer tether, but rather on its ""rare"" extended conformations."

Three different classes of human HDACs have been defined based on their homology to HDACs found in Saccharomyces cerevisiae: RPD3 (class I), HDA1 (class II), and SIR2 (class III). Here we describe the identification and functional characterization of HDAC7, a new member of the human class II HDAC family. Although HDAC7 is localized mostly to the cell nucleus, it is also found in the cytoplasm, suggesting nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. The HDAC activity of HDAC7 maps to a carboxyl-terminal domain and is dependent on the interaction with the class I HDAC, HDAC3, in the cell nucleus. Cytoplasmic HDAC7 that is not bound to HDAC3 is enzymatically inactive. We provide evidence that the transcriptional corepressors SMRT and N-CoR could serve as critical mediators of HDAC7 activity by binding class II HDACs and HDAC3 by two distinct repressor domains.

The repeating organizing unit of chromatin is the nucleosome (1van Holde K.E. Chromatin. Springer, New York1988: 111-148Google Scholar). Each nucleosome consists of a core built of two copies of histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, around which the DNA is tightly wrapped and bound by electrostatic interactions (2Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6842) Google Scholar). Consistent with the repressive effects of chromatin on gene expression, gene activation is often accompanied by nucleosomal rearrangements (3Workman J.L. Kingston R.E. Annu. Rev.

Such local or extended structural changes in chromatin are achieved by ATP-driven chromatin remodeling complexes and by posttranslational acetylation, methylation, or phosphorylation of histones (5Wu C.

Chromatin: Structure and Function. 3rd Ed. Academic Press, San Diego1998: xivGoogle Scholar). Localized changes in histone acetylation levels near the transcriptional start site of certain genes are linked to gene activation or repression (12Kuo M. vom Baur E. Struhl K. Allis C.D. Mol.

Class II HDACs 4, 5, and 7 interact with SMRT, N-CoR, and BCoR, an additional corepressor that mediates repression by BCL-6 (35Kao H.Y. Downes M. Ordentlich P. Evans R.M.

Mutational analysis of RPD3 and HDAC1 indicates that enzymatic activity is essential for the transcriptional regulatory functions of these proteins in vivo (49Kadosh D. Struhl K. Mol. Cell.

However, with few exceptions, it has been remarkably difficult to obtain recombinant HDAC proteins demonstrating enzymatic activity in vitro.

In addition, biochemical fractionation of mammalian cell extracts has indicated that several additional proteins beside HDAC1 and HDAC2 might be necessary to build an enzymatically active HDAC1·HDAC2 core complex. The limitations observed in the expression of recombinant HDAC activity could therefore be the consequence of missing essential cofactors (53Zhang Y. Ng H.H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Bird A. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1924-1935Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). This report describes the identification and characterization of a new member of the class II HDAC family, human HDAC7. In vivo, HDAC7 is associated with enzymatic activity when it is in the cell nucleus but not when it is in the cytoplasm. This enzymatic activity is dependent on the association of the carboxyl-terminal region of HDAC7 with the class I HDAC HDAC3. We provide evidence that the transcriptional corepressors SMRT and N-CoR could serve as mediators that simultaneously bind class II HDACs and HDAC3 by two distinct repressor domains. All cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and grown in RPMI 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a humidified incubator. The following cell lines were used in these experiments: HISM, human smooth muscle (ATCC CRL-1692); SKN, human neuroblastoma (ATCC HTB-11); 10T1/2, mouse embryo (ATCC CCL-226); Cos7, African green monkey, SV40-transformed kidney cells (ATCC CRL-1651); HeLa, human cervical epitheloid carcinoma (ATCC CCL-2.1); and 293, transformed human kidney (ATCC CRL-1573).

Overlapping human cDNA fragments were amplified from a HeLa cell cDNA library (CLONTECH) using the following primer pairs: 5′-CGGAATTCCAGCCCATGGACCTGCGGGTG-3′ and 5′-CGGAATTCGACCGAGTCATAGATCAGCC-3′; and 5′- CGGAATTCACCATGGCCCCGCTGCTGACTGTGCC-3′ and 5′- CGGAATTCGAGATTCATAGGTTCTTCCTC-3′. The full-length HDAC7 ORF was generated using a unique BclI site in these fragments, and the resulting cDNA was extended in the 5′ and 3′ directions by anchored polymerase chain reaction strategies (rapid amplification of cDNA ends). Nucleotide sequencing on both strands was performed using the dideoxy sequencing method (ABI bioprism). FLAG-tagged expression vectors for different HDACs were generated as described previously (30Fischle W. Emiliani S. Hendzel M.J. Nagase T. Nomura N. Voelter W. Verdin E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11713-11720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). HDAC5 cDNA was obtained as an expressed sequence tag clone (Id 1142916) from the IMAGE Consortium, and the sequence corresponding to nucleotides 394–3369 of the HDAC5 ORF was used to construct the fusion protein (26Grozinger C.M. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4868-4873Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). HDAC6 was cloned from a human cDNA library (CLONTECH) with primers corresponding to the sequence from GenBankTM accession number AJ011972 (defined as a transcription map in Xp11). The sequence of this ORF is identical to that of HDAC6 (26Grozinger C.M. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4868-4873Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar).

EcoRI fragments from the pcDNA3.1 expression constructs were subcloned into the EcoRI site of pGEX4T1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to generate amino-terminal GST fusion proteins. A multiple human tissue Northern blot was obtained from CLONTECH.32P-Labeled probes corresponding to hHDAC7 and hGAPDH cDNAs were prepared with the Multiprime DNA labeling system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The blots were prehybridized and hybridized with ExpressHyb hybridization solution (CLONTECH) and washed under high stringency conditions (58Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Autoradiographs were analyzed with a FUJIX BAS1000 phosphorus imaging system (Fuji, Tokyo, Japan). cDNA fragments corresponding to aa 118–662 of hHDAC4 and aa 1–487 of hHDAC7 were cloned into the pGEX4T1 vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to generate hybrid proteins fused to GST. Fusion proteins were expressed in BL21 RIP (Stratagene), purified according to standard procedures (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and separated from copurified contaminating bacterial proteins by large scale preparative SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Antisera against the recombinant proteins were raised in New Zealand White rabbits according to standard procedures (Harlan Bioproducts). To eliminate antibody species with affinity for GST and to reduce putative crossreactivity, antisera were depleted on GST and ortholog GST-HDAC columns (e.g. HDAC7 antiserum was depleted on GST-HDAC4 columns) followed by purification of the IgG species according to standard protocols (59Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation was performed as described previously (30Fischle W. Emiliani S.

For FLAG-tagged proteins, M2-agarose (Sigma) was used at 15 μl/ml. For precipitation of endogenous proteins, the polyclonal anti-HDAC4 and anti-HDAC7 antisera were used at ∼10 μg/ml in combination with 20 μl/ml of a preblocked (10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) 50% protein G-Sepharose slurry (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis were performed according to standard procedures (57Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995Google Scholar). Western blots were developed with ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Polyclonal anti-HDAC1 and anti-HDAC3 antisera have been described previously (60Emiliani S. Fischle W. Van Lint C. Al-Abed Y. Verdin E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2795-2800Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Polyclonal anti-IKKα, anti-SIN3, anti-HDAC2, and anti-FLAG antisera used were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). SMRT and N-CoR antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY) and Affinity BioReagents (Golden, CO). HDAC activity was measured with a chemically [3H]acetylated peptide corresponding to the amino-terminal tail of histone H4 as described previously (30Fischle W. Emiliani S. Hendzel M.J. Nagase T. Nomura N. Voelter W. Verdin E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11713-11720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Complexes immobilized on beads either from immunoprecipitations or GST pull-down assays were resuspended in 30 μl of HD buffer containing ∼50,000 counts/min of the substrate. The cell nuclei were isolated and lysed according to Osborn et al.(61Osborn L. Kunkel S. Nabel G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2336-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. The cells were plated onto glass coverslips and transfected the following day with LipofectAMINE 2000 (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After incubation overnight, the transfected cells were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2, and 0.5% Triton X-100 and then incubated for 60 min at room temperature with the appropriate antibodies at dilutions typically between 1:100 and 1:1000. The cells were mounted onto glass slides in phosphate-buffered saline with 90% glycerol containing 1 mm paraphenylenediamine as an antifade reagent. Confocal microscopy was performed with a Zeiss LSM510 laser scanning confocal microscope at 488 nm (Alexa 488-conjugated secondary antibodies) and 543 nm (Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies). The pinhole aperture was set to 1.0 airy unit for each channel. Band pass filters and sequential scanning of individual fluorescent probes were used to eliminate cross-talk between channels. The images were collected as 12-bit images, and each channel was independently rescaled from 0 to 255 (8-bit) for final presentation. Fusion proteins were expressed in DH5α (Life Technologies, Inc.) or BL21 RIP (Stratagene) and purified according to standard protocols (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Purity, as well as protein amount, was checked on SDS-PAGE gels stained with Coomassie Blue. For pull-down reactions, extracts from 293, HeLa, A301, or SupTI cells were used (30Fischle W. Emiliani S.

After incubation for 3 h at 4 °C with rocking, reactions were washed three times in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, three times in the same buffer but at 1 m NaCl, and two times in HD buffer (30Fischle W.

Pull-down reactions were split and either processed for histone deacetylase activity assays or for Western blotting. For pull-down reactions with 35S-labeled proteins, cDNAs were transcribed and translated with the TNT reticulocyte system (Promega). The labeling reaction (5 μl) was incubated with GST fusion proteins in a total volume of 200 μl of GST buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm KCl, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5% nonfat dry milk, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) for 1 h at 4 °C with rocking. The reactions were washed five times in the same buffer, and bound proteins were resolved on denaturing SDS-PAGE gels for analysis by autoradiography. We identified previously a new human genomic sequence, located on chromosome 12q31 (GenBankTM accession number AC0004466) that potentially encoded a new human class II HDAC (30Fischle W. Emiliani S.

Two different computer algorithms for the prediction of exon-intron boundaries (Genscan (54Burge C. Karlin S. J. Mol.

Biol. 1997; 5: 294-302PubMed Google Scholar)) and the sequence similarity to HDAC4 and HDAC5 were used to deduce a putative cDNA encoded by this locus. Based on this information we devised a polymerase chain reaction strategy in combination with 5′ and 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends reactions to clone several cDNAs sharing an ORF of 2739 base pairs but different 5′ extremities. The amplified cDNAs contained a single putative start codon embedded in a sequence environment favorable for the initiation of translation (63Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar) and in-frame with an upstream stop codon (data not shown). The corresponding ORF translated to a putative polypeptide of 912 aa (Fig.1 A). The same polypeptide originating from the 12q31 locus was independently predicted by the Human Genome Project (GenBankTM accession number XP-007047). Interestingly, the amino terminus of human HDAC7 is 22 aa shorter than that of murine HDAC7, despite >95% conservation of the rest of the protein (35Kao H.Y. Downes M. Ordentlich P. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 55-66PubMed Google Scholar). A five-amino acid motif, PXDLR (64Zhang C.L. McKinsey T.A. Lu J.-R. Olson E.N. J. Biol.

As previously reported for other class II HDACs, HDAC7 contains two distinct domains. The carboxyl-terminal domain (aa 438–912) shows high homology to known HDACs, in particular class II HDACs. The amino-terminal domain is related to similar regions in HDAC4, HDAC5, and hMITR (Fig. 1, A and B). The expression of HDAC7 in different tissues was examined by Northern blot (Fig. 1 C). A major transcript of 4.4 kb was detected mainly in heart and placenta but also in pancreas, lung, and skeletal muscle. A weaker band corresponding to 6.0 kb might represent a differentially spliced isoform of the HDAC7 mRNA. The size of 4.4 kb is in good agreement with the lengths of several cDNAs cloned (data not sh"

Genetic variation in antigenic, drug resistance, and pathogenesis determinants is abundant, consistent with an ancient origin of P. falciparum, whereas DNA variation at silent (synonymous) sites in coding sequences appears virtually absent, consistent with a recent origin of the parasite. To resolve this paradox, we analyzed introns and demonstrated that these are deficient in single-nucleotide polymorphisms, as are synonymous sites in coding regions. These data establish the recent origin of P. falciparum and further provide an explanation for the abundant diversity observed in antigen and other selected genes."

This represents an example of a commonly used therapeutic agent that effectively activates SXR. We also show that other protease inhibitors are weaker (saquinavir) or unable to activate SXR (nelfinavir, indinavir) thus defining analogs that fail to induce SXR-regulated clearance pathways. Interestingly, HIV protease inhibitors are distinct from previously known SXR ligands in that they are peptide mimetic compounds.

Although these drugs directly target the HIV protease, theirin vivo efficacy can be limited by efficient drug clearance pathways (1Piscitelli S.C. Gallicano K.D. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344: 984-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). HIV protease inhibitors are administered orally, and their intestinal uptake is reduced by P-glycoprotein (ABCB1), a broad-specificity efflux pump that is the product of theMDR1 gene (2Ambudkar S.V. Dey S. Hrycyna C.A. Ramachandra M. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 361-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1929) Google Scholar). Any protease inhibitor that escapes P-glycoprotein-mediated efflux enters the portal blood where it can ultimately be degraded by the hepatic cytochrome P450 CYP3A4. HIV protease inhibitors may also serve as substrates for MRP2 (ABCC2) (3Miller D.S. Nobmann S.N. Gutmann H. Toeroek M. Drewe J. Fricker G. Mol.

Optimization of HIV treatment requires a thorough understanding of how protease inhibitors interact with and regulate these xenobiotic clearance pathways. Recent studies have demonstrated that the orphan nuclear receptor, SXR (also known as PXR, PAR, PRR, NR1I2), plays a central role in regulating CYP3A4 and MDR1 transcription (6Synold T.W. Dussault I. Forman B.M. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 584-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar). SXR is activated by a diverse array of pharmaceutical agents including taxol, rifampicin, SR12813, clotrimazole, phenobarbital, and hyperforin (7Jones S.A. Moore L.B. Shenk J.L. Wisely G.B.

These studies indicate that SXR is a xenobiotic sensor that coordinately regulates drug clearance in the liver and intestine. Indeed, gene knockout studies have confirmed a role for SXR in regulating xenobiotic accumulation (11Xie W. Barwick J.L. Downes M. Blumberg B. Simon C.M. Nelson M.C.

A. 2001; 98: 3369-3374Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar). However, most of the drugs that are known to activate SXR are not commonly used clinically, thus it remains unclear whether SXR activation represents a widespread pharmacologic problem. In this report we show that SXR activates expression of MRP2. This extends the repertoire of SXR target genes to include those involved in biliary drug excretion. We also demonstrate that certain HIV protease inhibitors bind to and activate SXR at pharmacologically relevant concentrations. Previously known ligands for SXR and other nuclear receptors are derived from steroids, lipids, or traditional small molecule drugs. As HIV protease inhibitors are peptide mimetic compounds, our findings widen the diversity of SXR ligands to include this unique chemical class of pharmaceutical agents. Thus, the pharmacologic implications of SXR action are much broader than originally imagined. A cytomegalovirus expression vector was used to express the following proteins: Gal-SXR (human SXR ligand binding domain, GenBankTM accession number AF061056; Lys107-Ser443), Gal-PBP (human PBP, AF283812; Val 574-Ser649), and VP-SXR (human SXR ligand binding domain; Lys107-Ser443). Gal-PXR containing the ligand binding domain of mouse PXR (AF031814) was obtained from Bruce Blumberg. Gal4 fusions contained the indicated fragments fused to the C-terminal end of the yeast Gal4 DNA binding domain; VP16 fusions contained the 78-amino acid herpesvirus VP16 transactivation domain. All other constructs were as described previously (6Synold T.W. Dussault I. Forman B.M. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 584-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar). Ritonavir was obtained from Moravek Biochemicals (Brea, CA); saquinavir, nelfinavir, and indinavir were obtained from the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program; rifampicin and pregnenolone-16α-carbonitrile were obtained from Sigma. CV-1 cells were grown and transfected as described (6Synold T.W. Dussault I. Forman B.M. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 584-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar). Primary human hepatocytes were obtained from Clonetics (Walkersville, MD) and cultured according to the vendors instructions. Cells were treated with the indicated compounds for 24 h, and total RNA was isolated using the Trizol reagent. Human LS180 cells were maintained in Eagle's minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mmsodium pyruvate, 2 mml-glutamine, non-essential amino acids, 50 units/ml penicillin G, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. One day prior to treatment LS180 cells were switched to phenol red-free medium containing 10% resin charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum and then treated for 24 h with the indicated compounds. Northern blots were prepared from total RNA and analyzed with the following probes: MRP2 (GenBankTMaccession number NM_000392; nt 3960–4441), MDR1 (NM_000927; nt 843–1111), CYP2C8 (NM_000770; nt 700–888), CYP3A4 (M18907; nt 1521–2058), and GAPDH (NM_002046; nt 101–331). Note that the CYP2C8 probe was specific as it did not cross-hybridize to the two most closely related members of the CYP2C family, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 (data not shown). The human SXR ligand binding domain was expressed in Escherichia coli with an N-terminal His tag and purified. For binding assays 0.25 μg of His-tagged SXR was added per well of a 96-well nickel chelate flash plate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and incubated at room temperature for 30 min in binding buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm CHAPS, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol). After 30 min the well was washed three times with binding buffer, and 37.5 nm[3H]SR12813 (7Jones S.A. Moore L.B. Shenk J.L. Wisely G.B. Hamilton G.A. McKee D.D. Tomkinson N.C. LeCluyse E.L. Lambert M.H. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. Moore J.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 27-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar) was added in 100 μl of binding buffer. Where indicated, unlabeled competitor ligands were added, and the incubation was continued for 75 min at room temperature with shaking. Readings were taken using a Topcount scintillation counter (Packard, Meriden, CT). To identify whether SXR regulated other genes involved in xenobiotic clearance, a number of candidate genes were analyzed for their ability to respond to SXR ligands (data not shown). As seen in Fig. 1 A, several SXR ligands including hyperforin, rifampicin, and SR12813 induced expression ofMRP2 in primary human hepatocytes. MRP2 (ABCC2, cMOAT), a member of the ATP binding cassette transporter family is a multispecific organic anion transporter expressed on the hepatocyte bile canalicular membrane (5Keppler D. Konig J. Semin. Liver Dis. 2000; 20: 265-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). This protein is responsible for the biliary excretion of a number of drug metabolites. Interestingly, HIV protease inhibitors serve as substrates for MRP2 (3Miller D.S. Nobmann S.N. Gutmann H. Toeroek M. Drewe J. Fricker G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1357-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 4Gutmann H. Fricker G. Drewe J. Toeroek M. Miller D.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 383-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), as well as for other SXR target genes including CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein (1Piscitelli S.C. Gallicano K.D. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344: 984-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Our previous studies with taxol demonstrated that this drug is both a CYP3A4/P-glycoprotein substrate and an activator of SXR (6Synold T.W. Dussault I. Forman B.M. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 584-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar). This overlap in specificity among SXR and its target genes prompted us to explore the possibility that HIV protease inhibitors may also serve as SXR ligands. CV-1 cells were transfected with a Gal4 reporter along with a vector expressing the ligand binding domain of human SXR linked to the DNA binding domain of yeast Gal4 (Gal-SXR). As expected, this chimeric receptor was activated by SXR ligands such as hyperforin and rifampicin, but not by PCN, a specific agonist of PXR, the mouse ortholog of SXR (13Kliewer S.A. Moore J.T. Wade L. Staudinger J.L. Watson M.A. Jones S.A. McKee D.D. Oliver B.B. Willson T.M. Zetterstrom R.H. Perlmann T. Lehmann J.M. Cell. 1998; 92: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1344) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 B). Surprisingly, the HIV protease inhibitor ritonavir also activated SXR. Dose response analysis (Fig. 1 C) indicated that activation by ritonavir occurred at clinically relevant concentrations (EC50 ≈ 2 μm). In contrast, the same doses of ritonavir were less effective at activating PXR and failed to activate RXR (Fig.1 C), the heterodimeric partner of SXR. Activation of SXR by ritonavir was specific as this compound had no effect on other nuclear receptors including mouse PXR, estrogen receptor α, vitamin D receptor, thyroid hormone receptor β, retinoic acid receptor α, RXRα, LXRα, FXR, PPARα, -γ, -δ, or CARβ (Fig.1 D), a nuclear receptor whose sequence and ligand responsiveness are closely related to that of SXR (14Forman B.M. Tzameli I. Choi H.S. Chen J. Simha D. Seol W. Evans R.M. Moore D.D. Nature. 1998; 395: 612-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 15Moore L.B. Parks D.J. Jones S.A. Bledsoe R.K. Consler T.G. Stimmel J.B. Goodwin B. Liddle C. Blanchard S.G. Willson T.M. Collins J.L. Kliewer S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15122-15127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). The ability of ritonavir to activate SXR implies that the effectiveness of this drug could be limited by CYP3A4-mediated metabolism and/or P-glycoprotein- and MRP2-mediated excretion. This raises the possibility that HIV protease inhibitors that lack SXR agonist activity may have improved pharmacokinetic properties. Thus, we examined the ability of other HIV protease inhibitors to activate SXR. As indicated in Fig. 2 A, rifampicin and ritonavir (5 μm) both activated Gal-SXR, but other protease inhibitors including saquinavir, nelfinavir, and indinavir failed to activate at concentrations as high as 10 μm. However, at 30 μm saquinavir activated SXR 7-fold whereas nelfinavir and indinavir remained inactive (data not shown). Thus, the hierarchy of response of SXR to HIV protease inhibitors is ritonavir > saquinavir ≫ nelfinavir and indinavir. None of the protease inhibitors were effective activators of PXR, the mouse ortholog of SXR (Fig. 2 B). The inability of nelfinavir and indinavir to activate SXR (“SXR-transparent” drugs) suggests that these protease inhibitors may be less likely to promote drug-drug interactions or to autoinduce their own clearance. Given the potential utility in generating SXR-transparent drugs, we sought to delineate the molecular mechanism underlying the SXR-transparent activity of nelfinavir and indinavir. Ligands for nuclear hormone receptors activate transcription by promoting receptor association with coactivator proteins including members of the p160 family (SRC-1, ACTR, GRIP) and PBP (DRIP205, TRAP220) (16Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We utilized a mammalian two-hybrid assay to compare the effects of HIV protease inhibitors on coactivator recruitment. CV-1 cells were transiently transfected with a Gal4 reporter construct, a vector expressing a VP16-SXR ligand binding domain fusion (VP-SXR), and an expression vector for the Gal4 DNA binding domain or Gal4 linked to the coactivator interaction domain of PBP (Gal-PBP). In this system, reporter expression is activated if the herpesvirus VP16 transactivation domain becomes tethered to the promoter via an SXR-coactivator interaction (6Synold T.W. Dussault I. Forman B.M. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 584-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar). Rifampicin and ritonavir promoted a specific interaction with PBP (Fig. 2 C) whereas saquinavir had a minimal effect, and nelfinavir and indinavir were inactive. Similar effects were seen with other coactivators (data not shown), and no recruitment was seen with a Gal4 control. Thus, the relative ability of HIV protease inhibitors to recruit coactivators closely parallels their ability to activate SXR (ritonavir > saquinavir ≫ nelfinavir and indinavir). The above findings suggest that ritonavir may be acting as an SXR ligand. To test this directly, we utilized a scintillation proximity assay to monitor the ability of ritonavir to displace radioactive ligands from SXR. His-tagged SXR protein was incubated with [3H]SR12813 in a nickel chelate-coated 96-well flash plate. In this assay, [3H]SR12813 is specifically bound to immobilized SXR (7Jones S.A. Moore L.B. Shenk J.L. Wisely G.B. Hamilton G.A. McKee D.D. Tomkinson N.C. LeCluyse E.L. Lambert M.H. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. Moore J.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 27-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar) and produces a signal by exciting the scintillant in the flash plate. As expected, [3H]SR12813 bound to SXR (Fig. 2 D), and this binding was specifically displaced by an excess of unlabeled hyperforin (5 μm). Similarly, 5 μm ritonavir was an effective competitor, but saquinavir, nelfinavir, and indinavir all failed to compete at this concentration. These findings clearly demonstrate that the HIV protease inhibitor ritonavir is a specific ligand for the nuclear receptor SXR. Finally, as ritonavir is an SXR ligand, we asked whether this drug activates SXR target genes (6Synold T.W. Dussault I. Forman B.M. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 584-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar) in the liver and intestine. Primary human hepatocytes were treated with rifampicin, hyperforin, or ritonavir and expression of CYP3A4, CYP2C8, andMRP2 was monitored by Northern analysis. As expected for an SXR ligand, ritonavir activated expression of all three target genes (Fig. 3 A) and did so with an efficacy similar to rifampicin and hyperforin. Similarly,MDR1 expression was strongly induced by ritonavir in intestinal LS180 cells (Fig. 3 B). These data demonstrate that ritonavir coordinately activates expression of SXR target genes that control drug clearance in the liver and intestine. Previous studies have demonstrated that SXR is a xenobiotic sensor that activates expression of CYP3A4, CYP2C8, andMDR1 (6Synold T.W. Dussault I. Forman B.M. Nat.

Chem. 2001; 276: 14581-14587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). SXR is thus a master regulator of xenobiotic clearance that coordinately controls metabolism in the liver and absorption in the intestine. Like its target genes, SXR displays a broad specificity for a variety of xenobiotic compounds including rifampicin, SR12813, clotrimazole, phenobarbital, and the progestin/glucocorticoid antagonist RU486 (7Jones S.A. Moore L.B. Shenk J.L. Wisely G.B. Hamilton G.A. McKee D.D. Tomkinson N.C. LeCluyse E.L. Lambert M.H. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. Moore J.T. Mol.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3195-3205Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). This broad specificity facilitates a form of chemical immunity that allows the body to detect and then remove foreign compounds. It has been suggested that this broad specificity could limit the pharmacologic activity of potentially large numbers of therapeutic agents. However, the most effective SXR agonists described to date are either not widely used in the clinic (e.g. rifampicin, SR12813, phenobarbital) or fail to activate SXR at pharmacologically relevant concentrations (clotrimazole, RU486). We now demonstrate that a commonly used HIV protease inhibitor, ritonavir, is an agonist ligand for SXR. HIV protease inhibitors are members of a chemical class known as peptide mimetics. These compounds are designed to simulate the structure of active protein moieties and thus are appealing substrates for future drug discovery. Our demonstration that peptide mimetics can activate SXR has widespread implications for discovery efforts involving peptide mimetic agents. We find that ritonavir binds and activates SXR with an EC50of ∼2 μm. This concentration is pharmacologically relevant as it matches both the circulating and 90% effective concentrations of this drug (18van Heeswijk R.P. Veldkamp A.I. Mulder J.W. Meenhorst P.L. Lange J.M. Beijnen J.H. Hoetelmans R.M. AIDS. 2000; 14: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 19Hsu A. Granneman G.R. Witt G. Locke C. Denissen J. Molla A. Valdes J. Smith J. Erdman K. Lyons N. Niu P. Decourt J.P. Fourtillan J.B. Girault J. Leonard J.M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1997; 41: 898-905Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, activation of SXR is an unavoidable side effect of reaching effective antiviral concentrations. This implies that SXR target genes such as CYP3A4,CYP2C8, and MDR1 will be up-regulated in patients taking this drug. Induction of MDR1 is worrisome as HIV protease inhibitors are administered orally, and their intestinal uptake is limited by P-glycoprotein (1Piscitelli S.C. Gallicano K.D. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344: 984-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Similarly, protease inhibitors are metabolized by CYP3A4 (1Piscitelli S.C. Gallicano K.D. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344: 984-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), so induction of this enzyme could result in autoinduced metabolism in the liver. These mechanisms are likely to underlie the clinical observation that ritonavir induces its own metabolism during the first 2 weeks of therapy (19Hsu A. Granneman G.R. Witt G. Locke C. Denissen J. Molla A. Valdes J. Smith J. Erdman K. Lyons N. Niu P. Decourt J.P. Fourtillan J.B. Girault J. Leonard J.M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1997; 41: 898-905Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HIV-infected individuals are often simultaneously treated with multiple drugs to limit viral loads and/or to treat associated infections. Drugs that activate SXR can be particularly problematic in such situations. For example, protease inhibitors are often administered with azidothymidine, a reverse transcriptase inhibitor that can be metabolized by CYP2C8/9 (20Pan-Zhou X.R. Cretton-Scott E. Zhou X.J. Yang M.X. Lasker J.M. Sommadossi J.P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 55: 757-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We show that ritonavir can enhance expression of CYP2C8, which in turn could metabolize and inactivate azidothymidine. Our findings may help to predict and thus limit potentially dangerous drug interactions that are associated with ritonavir. Because HIV protease inhibitors can interact with SXR, CYP3A4, and P-glycoprotein, their overall effects on drug clearance will be determined by their relative potency to activate SXR versustheir ability to competitively inhibit target genes such as CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein. To minimize adverse drug-drug interactions, it will be necessary to identify protease inhibitors that fail to modulate the activities of both SXR and its target genes. We demonstrate that analogs such as nelfinavir and indinavir do not bind SXR. This provides further “proof-of-principle” that SXR can be used as a tool to identify drugs that fail to induce SXR-regulated pathways. As has been described with other compounds, we find that human SXR and its mouse ortholog (PXR) display distinct responses to peptide mimetic protease inhibitors. This indicates that rodent models cannot be used to accurately predict the pharmacokinetic properties of HIV protease inhibitors. Finally, we found that MRP2 mRNA is induced within 24 h of exposure to a variety of SXR ligands. It is not known whether this represents a direct effect mediated by an SXR response element. Whatever the mechanism, it is clear that MRP2 is a downstream target of SXR activation. MRP2 is a multispecific organic anion transporter expressed on the hepatocyte bile canalicular membrane and is responsible for the biliary excretion of a number of drug metabolites. The ability of SXR to activate this gene implies that SXR can regulate biliary excretion of xenobiotic compounds and their conjugates. Thus, SXR appears to coordinately regulate multiple drug clearance pathways including intestinal uptake (P-glycoprotein), hepatic metabolism (CYP3A4 and CYP2C8), and biliary excretion. MRP2 has also been implicated in the biliary secretion of bile acid sulfates, bilirubin conjugates, and glutathione (5Keppler D. Konig J. Semin. Liver Dis. 2000; 20: 265-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Once in the bile, the tripeptide glutathione can be hydrolyzed into its component amino acids. This produces an increase in osmotic pressure, which is a driving force for enhanced bile flow. Our demonstration of a link between SXR and MRP2 provides a molecular basis to account for the 25-year-old observation that bile flow is enhanced by compounds now known to activate PXR (21von Bergmann K. Schwarz H.P. Paumgartner G. Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol. 1975; 287: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 22Zsigmond G. Solymoss B. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1974; 145: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings raise the possibility that SXR agonists may be useful for treating cholestatic liver disease, i.e. hepatic disorders resulting from impaired bile flow."

Biosci. 2000; 5: D72-D83Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The neuritic plaques, also known as senile plaques, are predominantly composed of Aβ, a cluster of aggregated and heterogeneous peptides of 39–43 amino acids (4Glenner G.G. Wong C.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 122: 1131-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1261) Google Scholar). The most pathogenic Aβ peptide is the less soluble 42-amino acid peptide (Aβ42), although the concentration of Aβ40 is generally much higher than Aβ42. Excision of Aβ peptides from their amyloid precursor protein requires sequential proteolytic cleavages by the β- and γ-secretases, respectively. β-secretase cleaves APP1 to produce two major components: secreted ectodomain sAPPβ and the C-terminal fragment CTF99. The latter can be further cleaved by γ-secretase to release Aβ. Genetic linkage analysis suggests that increased total Aβ levels or an increase in the ratio of Aβ42/Aβ40 is associated with the severity of AD dementia (reviewed in Refs. 1Selkoe D.J.

Mechanisms by which BACE1 trafficking and activity are regulated have not been substantially elucidated. BACE1 is phosphorylated by casein kinase I at serine 498, and dephosphorylation of this phosphorylated residue results in an accumulation of BACE1 in early endosomes due to an increased endocytosis from the plasma membrane and a retarded retrieval to the TGN (15Walter J.

A small fraction of BACE1 is shed near its transmembrane domain on the luminal side of the membrane to release a soluble BACE1, which cleaves APP, although at a much lower efficiency compared with full-length BACE1 (17Benjannet S.

In addition, although BACE1 catalytic domains have been defined, the targeting signal(s) required for correct localization remain unclear. In the present investigation, we demonstrate that BACE1 is largely situated in the distal Golgi membrane with a minor presence in the ER, endosomes, and plasma membrane in neuroblastoma cells expressing endogenous or low levels of transfected BACE1. We found that the single transmembrane domain is required for BACE1 to be retained in the Golgi stacks where major processing of the APP substrate at the β-site occurs in cells. Furthermore, removal of the transmembrane domain of BACE1 disrupts the optimal processing of APP substrate at the β-site and thus inhibits CTF99 formation. The indispensable role of the transmembrane domain is further strengthened by the observation that BACE1, lacking its transmembrane domain, remains inactive even when it is retained in the ER by addition of an ER retention signal. Antibodies against γ-adaptin, EEA1, GM130, and syntaxin 6 were purchased from Transduction Laboratory (Lexington, KY); an antibody against p58 was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO); antibodies 22C11 and anti-HA (clone 3F10) were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals(Indianapolis, IN); and antibodies 4G8 and 6E10 were purchased from Senetek PLC (St. Louis, MO). DNA expression constructs were generated by standard polymerase chain reaction amplification methods, and the engineered plasmid DNA was confirmed by sequencing. For expressing GFP chimeric proteins, polymerase chain reaction-amplified products were inserted in-frame between BamHI and EcoRI sites within the vector pEGFP-N3 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). For the other expression constructs, the mammalian expression pCDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was used. By using the GCG PepPlot program, four peptides were selected and synthesized for producing peptide antibodies. The peptide B278, which corresponds to the sequence YLRPVEDVATSQD from 366 to 378; B279, which corresponds to the sequence LRLPKKVFEAAVKSIK from 295 to 310; B280, which corresponds to the sequence DDSLEPFFDSLVKQTHV from 191 to 207; and B690, which corresponds to the sequence CLRQQHDDFADDISLLK from 485 to 501 of BACE1 protein were individually conjugated with keyhole limpet hemocyanin via a cysteine residue according to the instructions provided (Pierce, Rockford, IL). The protocol for generating the peptide antibody and injection of conjugated peptides into rabbits was conducted by Covance (Denver, PA). Immunofluorescence on whole cells (SHEP cells, Neuro-2a cells, or HEK-293 cells) was performed using standard methods. Cells were first grown to 50–80% confluence in chambers (Lab-Tek, Naperville, IL) and then transfected with an individual construct using either the calcium phosphate method or LipofectAMINE 2000 according to the protocol provided by Life Technologies, Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD). After transfection, cells were washed with PBS and fixed for 15 min with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Cells were then treated with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 2 min. After removal of detergent, fixed cells were incubated with primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. After extensive washing, the Texas red- or Alexa 488-labeled secondary antibody was added to the incubation buffer according to the manufacturer's suggestions (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Fluorescence signals of stained BACE1 or marker proteins with various antibodies were visualized by confocal microscope (LSM510, Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). To separate and enrich TGN and ER membranes, Neuro-2a cells stably transfected with human APP695 and BACE1 were homogenized with a stainless steel ball-bearing homogenizer in a buffer containing 0.25 msucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4), 1 mmMg(Ac)2, and protease inhibitor mixture. The homogenate was loaded onto the top of a step gradient comprised of 1.5 ml of 2m sucrose, 2.5 ml of 1.3 m sucrose, 2.5 ml of 1.16 m sucrose, 2 ml of 0.8 m sucrose, 2 ml of 0.5 m sucrose, and 1 ml of 0.25 m sucrose prepared in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) and 1 mm Mg(Ac)2. The gradients were centrifuged for 2.5 h at 100,000 × g in a Beckman SW41Ti rotor. Twelve 1-ml fractions were collected from the top of the gradient. The distributions of BACE1, APP, and APP-CTFs along the gradient were assayed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis. Equal volumes of solution from each fraction were separated on a 12% Tris-glycine gel (for BACE1), a 4–12% Tris-glycine gel (for APP and CTFs). Antibodies B690, 6E10, and 369 were used for detection of BACE1, APP, and APP-CTF proteins, respectively. Neuro-2a cells stably transfected with both human APP695 and BACE1 were labeled with [35S]methionine (500 μCi/ml) at 37 °C for 10 min and chased for 2 h at 20 °C in complete growth medium to accumulate labeled proteins in TGN. To restore vesicle trafficking from TGN, cells were transferred from 20 °C to 37 °C for 0, 10, 20, 30, 45 min, 1, 2, and 4 h. At the end of each time point, cells were incubated at 4 °C for biotinylation of cell surface proteins. Cell surface biotinylation was performed by washing plates three times with freshly prepared PBS-CM buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 1.0 mm MgCl2 and 1.3 mmCaCl2) followed by incubating cells with biotin labeling buffer (0.5 mg/ml sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimido-biotin in PBS-CM buffer) on ice for 15 min with gentle shaking. The biotinylation reaction was terminated by removing the labeling solution followed by the addition of 1 ml of quenching buffer (50 mmNH4Cl in PBS-CM) to each plate of cells. After washing plates twice with ice-cold PBS-CM buffer, cells were harvested and pelleted by spinning at 1000 × g for 3 min in a Brinkmann centrifuge. To detect the surface BACE1 protein, biotinylated cells were lysed in 100 μl of PBS buffer containing 0.5% deoxycholic acid and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 at 4 °C. Cell lysates were collected by spinning at 14,000 rpm for 3 min at 4 °C in a Brinkmann centrifuge. The resultant supernatants were diluted with 1 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 6 mm EDTA, 2.5% Triton X-100, 5 mmmethionine, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Biotin-labeled surface proteins and non-biotinylated intracellular proteins were separated by neutravidin beads (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Biotinylated proteins were eluted from the beads by heating at 95 °C for 5 min in 100 μl of 0.5% SDS-PBS buffer. Samples of both biotinylated and non-biotinylated BACE1 were immunoprecipitated using B690 antibody. Immunoreactive materials were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using a 12% Tris-glycine gel and visualized by autoradiography. In addition, Neuro-2a cells stably expressing human BACE1 proteins were grown to 70–80% confluence and subjected to proteinase K treatment at a concentration of 25 μg/ml for 15 min at 4 °C. After the treatment, medium was removed by aspiration, and the cells were collected from the plates by washing with PBS buffer containing protease inhibitors. Cells were then centrifuged at 800 ×g for 5 min and followed by washing twice with a large volume of PBS containing protease inhibitors to remove and inactivate the proteinase K. After washing, equal volumes of cell lysates were prepared in 1× SDS sample buffer and analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE and Western blot using antibody B690 to detect the BACE1 proteins. Cell extracts were prepared as previously described (9Yan R. Bienkowski M.J. Shuck M.E. Miao H. Tory M.C. Pauley A.M. Brashier J.R. Stratman N.C. Mathews W.R. Buhl A.E. Carter D.B. Tomasselli A.G.

Equal amounts of cell extracts were used for Western analysis to detect APP with antibody C8 or 369; both recognize the APP C-terminal fifteen amino acids. Alternatively, equal amounts of cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibody 4G8 followed by Western analysis with antibody C8 (9Yan R. Bienkowski M.J. Shuck M.E. Miao H. Tory M.C.

The protein levels of BACE1 were measured with antibody B278 or as indicated. For detecting secreted BACE1 variants, the conditioned media were immunoprecipitated with antibody B280 and visualized with antibody B279. For detection of secreted APP, antibody 22C11 was used for detecting total secreted APP fragments, and antibody 6E10 was used for detecting secreted APPα, an α-secretase-cleaved product. To examine the cellular localization of endogenous BACE1, we first developed several lines of antibodies against different regions of BACE1. The specificity of the antibodies has been validated in immunofluorescence confocal microscopy studies. Human neuroblastoma SHEP cells transfected with a low dosage (0.01 μg of DNA per 105 cells) of BACE1 plasmid DNA containing a tag of HA at the C terminus were fixed and immunostained with antibody B280, which recognizes an epitope corresponding to BACE1 residues 191–207 (Fig. 1A) and anti-HA antibody (Fig. 1B). The BACE1 immunoreactivity using anti-BACE1 antibody exhibited a perinuclear distribution and overlapped well with the immunoreactivity of anti-HA antibody (Fig.1C). Most studies on BACE1 localization used cell lines overexpressing various levels of exogenous BACE1, a condition that may account for the discrepancies in BACE1 localization reported by these studies. We transiently transfected SHEP cells with different amounts of BACE1 expression construct and examined the localization of BACE1 in cells expressing a high (2 μg of DNA per 105 cells), low (0.1 μg of DNA per 105 cells), or endogenous level of BACE1 using immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. The high expression cells exhibited a broader pattern, including ER, Golgi, and endosomal-like staining (Fig. 1D) whereas cells expressing low levels of BACE1 (as shown in Fig. 1, A–C) or endogenous BACE1 (Fig.1, E and F) showed a more stringent Golgi-like pattern. We next examined the co-localization of endogenous BACE1 with several intracellular vesicle markers using non-transfected SHEP and mouse neuroblastoma Neuro-2a cells. BACE1 immunoreactivity is confined to an area of the cells that corresponds to the localization of a TGN protein, syntaxin 6 (Fig. 2A). The immunoreactivity of BACE1 showed a distinct pattern that differed from that of p58, a marker for the cis-Golgi compartments (Fig. 2B), although these two signals were near each other. A similar result was obtained when comparing the immunostaining patterns of BACE1 to GM130, another marker for early Golgi compartments (data not shown). These results suggest that the majority of BACE1 is transported beyond ER and early Golgi compartments to late Golgi or TGN after its synthesis in the ER. To further ascertain that the late Golgi/TGN is the major cellular site for BACE1, we treated either Neuro-2a cells or SHEP cells with brefeldin A (BFA), a fungal metabolite that inhibits secretory vesicles exit from the ER and leads to dissolution and redistribution of the Golgi apparatus. BFA has relatively little effect on the integrity of the TGN of treated cells. Treatment of Neuro-2a or SHEP cells with BFA resulted in a disruption of the Golgi apparatus, illuminated by a partial redistribution of GM130 immunofluorescence (Fig. 2E) but did not affect the staining of γ-adaptin, an adaptor protein highly enriched in the TGN membrane (24Wong D.H. Brodsky F.M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1171-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2D). The immunofluorescence of BACE1 was only marginally affected, suggesting that the majority of BACE1 is in BFA-insensitive vesicles. It has been demonstrated that treatment of cells with okadaic acid disrupts the entire Golgi complex, including TGN (25Horn M. Banting G. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We then treated SHEP cells with okadaic acid to induce a disruption of the Golgi stack. The BACE1 fluorescence signal became dispersed (Fig. 2E, right panel), reinforcing our conclusion that the majority of endogenous BACE1 is in the later Golgi/TGN. To evaluate a possible localization of BACE1 within endocytic compartments, we compared immunoreactivity of BACE1 with that of EEA1, a protein marker for endocytic endosomes. A punctate and typical endosomal staining pattern was observed for EEA1, distinct from that observed for BACE1 (Fig. 2C), suggesting that the majority of endogenous BACE1 is not stored in the endosomes. These findings, however, do not rule out an important role of the endocytic pathway in Aβ generation, which has been previously implicated (26Koo E. Squazzo S.L. .J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17386-17389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). BACE1 has been shown to travel to the plasma membrane and endosomes, although most BACE1 molecules remain in the TGN, and this trafficking event is regulated by protein phosphorylation of BACE. Furthermore, two-way trafficking pathways have been described between the plasma membrane, recycling endocytic compartments and the TGN, which may contribute to a dynamic transport of a protein between these compartments. Recent reports indicate that trafficking of BACE1 to the plasma membrane and the endocytic pathway occurs. The presence of BACE1 at the plasma membrane may be overlooked by immunofluorescence microscopic approaches due to a predominant level of BACE1 in the Golgi apparatus. Therefore, we assessed the amounts of BACE1 that exits from the TGN to the plasma membrane using a pulse-chase method in combination with cell surface biotinylation. Neuro-2a cells were pulse-labeled for 10 min with [35S]methionine at 37 °C and chased for 2 h at 20 °C. Under this low temperature condition, transport of BACE1 from the ER to the TGN occurs, but budding from TGN is prevented. Subsequent incubation at 37 °C for various times allowed trafficking of TGN BACE1 to the plasma membrane. Newly arrived cell surface BACE1 molecules containing [35S]methionine were then labeled with biotin at 4 °C for 15 min and separated from TGN-associated BACE1 by neutravidin bead precipitation. As shown in Fig. 3, most nascent BACE1 that accumulated in the TGN during the 20 °C incubation remains as an immature/non-cleaved form. BACE1 gradually matures in the TGN after the temperature is shifted back to 37 °C. These results suggest that the maturation and/or cleavage of pro-BACE1 is temperature-dependent, because many endoproteolysis reactions such as cleavages of APP and prohormones have been known to be temperature-dependent (27Xu H. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 169-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 28Xu H. Sweeney D. Wang R. Thinakaran G. Lo A.C. Sisodia S.S. Greengard P. Gandy S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3748-3752Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). It is evident that the majority (over 90%) of mature BACE1 stably resides intracellularly, likely in the TGN, even after 4-h chase at 37 °C. Only a small portion of BACE1 (mostly in a mature form) leaves the TGN and travels slowly to the cell surface, with a maximal appearance of BACE1 at the surface after a 2-h 37 °C chase. Our results suggested that BACE1 molecules targeted to the endocytic compartments from the plasma membrane only account for a small fraction of the total intracellular pool. To further assess the amount of cell surface BACE1 under steady state, proteinase K treatment was applied to the Neuro-2a cells stably expressing human BACE1 proteins. After a 15-min treatment with proteinase K at 4 °C, a small portion of BACE1 protein (<10%, based on the results using densitometer scanning) was sensitive whereas the majority of BACE1 remained resistant to proteinase K digestion. When 0.25% Triton X-100 was added during proteinase K treatment, all BACE1 molecules were degraded, indicating that the proteinase K penetrates into the cells under this condition and all the cellular BACE1 is labile to proteinase K digestion (Fig. 3B). In agreement with the result obtained from cell surface biotinylation, this confirms that cell surface BACE1 represents a small population of BACE1 proteins in Neuro-2a cells. The major cellular residence of BACE1 may not necessarily correlate with the site of its enzymatic activity. We attempted to locate the cellular site(s) involved in the generation of CTF99, an APP product of BACE1 cleavage, using a well-defined sucrose gradient fractionation method. A stable Neuro-2a cell line doubly expressing human BACE1 and APP was homogenized, and a post-nuclear supernatant was subjected to a stepwise sucrose gradient that was previously characterized for the enrichment of various vesicle proteins (29Gasparini L. Gouras G.K. Wang R. Gross R.S. Beal M.F. Greengard P. Xu H. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 2561-2570Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins present in each subcellular fraction were analyzed by Western blot. Consistent with our immunofluorescence data, the majority of mature BACE1 was found in the TGN-enriched fractions whereas two forms of immature BACE1 (likely representing non-glycosylated and glycosylated pro-BACE1 were mainly located in the ER-enriched fractions (Fig. 4, upper panel). APP molecules were found throughout the entire gradient with a large enrichment in TGN fractions, consistent with previous studies showing that APP mainly resides in the TGN (30Weidemann A. Konig G.

We report here that the stimulation of the CD95- and TRAIL-resistant human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line PancTuI with an agonistic anti-CD95 antibody or TRAIL resulted in activation of protein kinase C and NF-κB. Inhibition of protein kinase C by Gö6983 sensitized these cells to apoptotic challenges and strongly diminished activation of NF-κB by anti-CD95 and TRAIL. Similarly, inhibition of NF-κB by MG132 or by transient transfection with a dominant negative mutant of IκBα restored the responsiveness of PancTuI cells to both death ligands. In the CD95 and TRAIL-sensitive cell line Colo357 the induction of protein kinase C and NF-κB following activation of CD95 and TRAIL-R was very moderate compared with PancTuI cells. However, pre-incubation of these cells with PMA strongly reduced their apoptotic response to anti-CD95 and TRAIL. Taken together, we show that activation of protein kinase C operates directly in a death receptor-dependent manner in PancTuI cells and protect pancreatic tumour cells from anti-CD95 and TRAIL-mediated apoptosis by preventing the loss ΔΨm and Cytochrome c release as well as by induction of NF-κB."
https://openalex.org/W2013572062,"Indian hedgehog (Ihh), a member of the vertebrate hedgehog morphogen family, is a key signaling molecule that controls chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation. In this study, we show a novel function of Ihh. Namely, it acts as an essential mediator of mechanotransduction in cartilage. Cyclic mechanical stress greatly induces the expression of Ihh by chondrocytes. This induction is abolished by gadolinium, an inhibitor of stretch-activated channels. This suggests that the IHH gene is mechanoresponsive. The mechano-induction of Ihh is essential for stimulating chondrocyte proliferation by mechanical loading. The presence of an Ihh functional blocking antibody during loading completely abolishes the stimulatory effect of mechanical load on proliferation. Furthermore, Ihh mediates the mechanotransduction process in a bone morphogenic protein (BMP)-dependent and parathyroid hormone-related peptide-independent manner. BMP 2/4 are up-regulated by mechanical stress through the induction of Ihh, and BMP antagonist noggin inhibits mechanical stimulation of chondrocyte proliferation. This suggests BMP lies downstream of Ihh in mechanotransduction pathway. Our data suggest that Ihh may transduce mechanical signals during cartilage growth and repair processes. Indian hedgehog (Ihh), a member of the vertebrate hedgehog morphogen family, is a key signaling molecule that controls chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation. In this study, we show a novel function of Ihh. Namely, it acts as an essential mediator of mechanotransduction in cartilage. Cyclic mechanical stress greatly induces the expression of Ihh by chondrocytes. This induction is abolished by gadolinium, an inhibitor of stretch-activated channels. This suggests that the IHH gene is mechanoresponsive. The mechano-induction of Ihh is essential for stimulating chondrocyte proliferation by mechanical loading.

It has been shown that many developmental processes depend on external mechanical cues and/or internal molecules that sense mechanical signals (3Tavernarakis N. Driscoll M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 659-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the underlying mechanisms of mechanotransduction. Classic studies have demonstrated that cartilage homeostasis is regulated by mechanical stress during skeletal development. Cartilage formation can be induced by intermittent articulation of embryonic chick membranous bone, but not by a constant pressure or no mechanical stimulation (4Hall B.K. J. Exp. Zoo. 1968; 168: 283-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Conversely, elimination of mechanical stimulationin ovo by paralysis of muscles attached to the bone results in a decline of bone growth rate of 20–30% (5Murray P.D. Drachman D.B. J. Embryo. Exp. Morphol. 1969; 22: 349-371PubMed Google Scholar, 6Hall B.K. Herring S.W. J. Morphol. 1990; 206: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), with significant inhibition of chondrocyte proliferation in the growth plate (7Germiller J.A. Goldstein S.A. J. Orthop. Res. 1997; 15: 362-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In adult, fracture repair and skeletal remodeling is also regulated by mechanical stress (8Ashhurst D.E. Philo. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. Biol. Sci. 1986; 313: 271-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 9Schneiderman R. Keret D. Maroudas A. J. Orthop. Res. 1986; 4: 393-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 10Kim Y.J.

One of the striking examples of mechanical regulation of cellular activities is distraction osteogenesis, in which distraction forces are applied to a healing limb to stimulate bone formation (11Einhorn T.A. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 10-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 12Welch R.D. Birch J.G. Makarov M.R. Samchukov M.L. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). It is not known, however, how new bone formation is activated by mechanical stimulation, and what is the cellular signal transduction pathway to sense and convert mechanical signals into tissue growth and regeneration. Indian hedgehog (Ihh)1 is a member of the vertebrate hedgehog family that consists of Sonic, Indian, and Desert. All the hedgehog proteins undergo autoprocessing to generate a functional amino-terminal domain that is associated with the cell membrane via cholesterol (13McMahon A.P. Cell. 2000; 100: 185-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Ihh is expressed not only in cartilaginous growth plate during limb development (14Vortkamp A. Lee K. Lanske B. Segre G.V. Kronenberg H.M. Tabin C.J. Science. 1996; 273: 613-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar), but also during fracture healing in bone callus (15Vortkamp A. Pathi S. Peretti G.M. Caruso E.M. Zaleske D.J. Tabin C.J. Mech. Dev. 1998; 71: 65-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 16Ferguson C. Alpern E. Miclau T. Helms J.A. Mech. Dev. 1999; 87: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that Ihh is a key molecule that regulates chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation during endochondral bone formation (14Vortkamp A. Lee K. Lanske B. Segre G.V. Kronenberg H.M. Tabin C.J. Science. 1996; 273: 613-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar, 15Vortkamp A. Pathi S. Peretti G.M. Caruso E.M. Zaleske D.J. Tabin C.J. Mech.

Ihh achieves these functions by inducing a series of downstream factors, including its receptor patched (Ptc), a 12-pass transmembrane protein (13McMahon A.P. Cell. 2000; 100: 185-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), PTHrP (14Vortkamp A. Lee K. Lanske B. Segre G.V. Kronenberg H.M. Tabin C.J. Science. 1996; 273: 613-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar), and BMPs (18Pathi S. Rutenberg J.B. Johnson R.L. Vortkamp A. Dev. Biol. 1999; 209: 239-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 19Zou H. Wieser R. Massague J. Niswander L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2191-2203Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Both PTHrP and BMPs are potent regulators of cartilage development. It has been shown that PTHrP production in perichondrium is up-regulated by Ihh in a negative-feedback loop (14Vortkamp A. Lee K. Lanske B. Segre G.V. Kronenberg H.M. Tabin C.J. Science. 1996; 273: 613-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar, 20Lanske B. Karaplis A.C. Lee K. Luz A. Vortkamp A. Pirro A. Karperien M.

Kronenberg H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Neff L.A. Baron R. Broadus A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10240-10245Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). BMPs are another family of secreted proteins that regulate cartilage growth and differentiation (23Hogan B.L.M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). BMPs are found to be downstream of the Ihh pathway in vertebrate (18Pathi S. Rutenberg J.B. Johnson R.L. Vortkamp A. Dev. Biol. 1999; 209: 239-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 19Zou H. Wieser R. Massague J. Niswander L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2191-2203Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the equivalent of BMP inDrosophila, DPP, is induced by hedgehog (24Fietz M.J. Concordet J.P. Barbosa R. Johnson R. Krauss S. McMahon A.P. Tabin C. Ingham P.W. Development. 1994; suppl.: 43-51Google Scholar, 25Tanimoto H. Itoh S. ten Dijke P. Tabata T. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 59-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The actions of BMP can be inhibited by its antagonists, such as noggin. noggin knockout mice exhibit fused and malformed joints, a consequence of overproliferation and defective differentiation of chondrocytes (26Brunet L.J. McMahon J.A. McMahon A.P. Harland R.M. Science. 1998; 280: 1455-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). In a previous study (27Wu Q. Chen Q. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 383-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), we showed that mechanical stress stimulated chondrocyte proliferation, and this stimulation was abolished by stretch-activated channel (SAC) blocker gadolinium. In this study, we show that mechanical stimulation of chondrocyte proliferation is mediated by Ihh, whose induction by mechanical loading depends on gadolinium-sensitive SACs. Ihh acts as a critical mediator of mechanotransduction in chondrocytes by transducing and converting mechanical signals to stimulate chondrocyte proliferation. We tested this hypothesis in a new three-dimensional chondrocyte culture system that we established recently (27Wu Q. Chen Q. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 383-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In this system, primary chondrocytes from developing chick cartilage were cultured in a sponge of collagen networks to which cyclic mechanical stress was applied by a computer-controlled “Bio-stretcher” device (27Wu Q. Chen Q. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 383-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), thereby mimicking the mechanical stimulation developing cartilage experiences in vivo (28Cohen B. Chorney G.S. Phillips D.P. J. Orthop. Res. 1992; 10: 263-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Our results show that mechanical stress induces the expression of Ihh, which in turn transduces the mechanical signals in a BMP-dependent manner to stimulate chondrocyte proliferation. Chondrocytes were cultured in a new three-dimensional culture system that we established recently (27Wu Q. Chen Q. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 383-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Chondrocytes cultured in three-dimensional collagen scaffoldings form cartilage-like nodules that express specific markers of cartilage, including collagen type II, aggrecan, link protein, and matrilin-1(27). Briefly, chondrocytes were isolated from the caudal part (proliferating cartilage region) of 17-day-old embryonic chick sternum (29Chen Q. Johnson D.M. Haudenschild D.R. Goetinck P.F. Dev. Biol. 1995; 172: 293-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Isolated chondrocytes were suspended in plating medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum in Ham's F-12 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 1 × 107/ml. One hundred microliters of cell suspension was applied to the presoaked 2 × 2 × 0.25-cm collagen sponge (Gelform, Upjohn, Kalamazoo, MI) in Hank's balanced salt solution. After overnight incubation at 37 °C, the sponges were subjected to 5% elongation at 60 cycles/min, 15 min/h, by a computer-controlled Biostretch device (ICCT Technologies, Canada). This extent of matrix deformation may be comparable to that experienced in a growth platein vivo (28Cohen B. Chorney G.S. Phillips D.P. J. Orthop. Res. 1992; 10: 263-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Biostretch exerts a uniaxial stretch with square wave patterns. The mechanical properties of collagen sponges were described previously (27Wu Q. Chen Q. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 383-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 30Liu M. Montazeri S. Jedlovsky T. Van Wert R. Zhang J. Li R.K. Yan J. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. Anim. 1999; 35: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Conditioned medium collected from stretched and non-stretched chondrocytes after 1 or 2 days' incubation was added to chondrocytes at indicated concentrations, which were then incubated under non-stretch condition for 2 days. For determination of cell growth, chondrocytes were freed from sponges by collagenase digestion (27Wu Q. Chen Q. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 383-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) and counted with a hemacytometer (American Optical Corp., Buffalo, NY). The viability of cells was confirmed by trypan blue exclusion assay. Total RNA was isolated from chondrocytes in three-dimensional culture as described previously (27Wu Q. Chen Q. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 383-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In some cases, 10 μm gadolinium, a SAC blocker, was added into incubation medium 1 h before stretch. Quantification of Ihh mRNA was performed by real-time quantitative RT-PCR with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Prism 7700 sequence detection system, as described previously (27Wu Q. Chen Q. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 383-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 31Zhang Y. Chen Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32628-32634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). RT-PCR reaction was performed with the AmpliTaq Gold polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The forward and reverse primers of chick Ihh mRNA were 5′-CAGCGCTGGGTCATGAGC-3′ and 5′-AAGATCGCGCGGAACTCG-3′, respectively. The internal probe was 5′-(FAM)-CGCCGGTGTTCTCCTCGTCCTT-(TAMRA)-3′. They were designed according to GenBank™ accession no. U58511 (14Vortkamp A. Lee K. Lanske B. Segre G.V. Kronenberg H.M. Tabin C.J. Science. 1996; 273: 613-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar). The primers and probes of chick Ptc mRNA were 5′-AGC CAA CA T CC G GCC TC-3′ (forward), 5′-ATT CTT AGC CTT GTT TCT GGC ATA TAG-3′ (reverse), and 5′-(FAM)- CCG CCC AGA ATG GGT GCA TGA C-(TAMRA)-3′ respectively. They were designed according to GenBank™ accession no. U40074. The same amount of RNA was used for both stretched and non-stretched samples. The 18 S RNA was amplified at the same time and used as an internal control. The cycle threshold values for 18 S RNA and that of samples were measured, and the relative Ihh transcript levels were calculated by computer software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) (for detailed method, see Ref. 32Winer J. Jung C.K. Shackel I. Williams P.M. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 270: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1231) Google Scholar). The Hh functional blocking antibody 5 E1 (IgG1 isotype) (14Vortkamp A. Lee K. Lanske B. Segre G.V. Kronenberg H.M. Tabin C.J. Science. 1996; 273: 613-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar, 33Ericson J. Morton S. Kawakami A. Roelink H. Jessell T.M. Cell. 1996; 87: 661-673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar) and a control antibody anti-osteopontin MPIIIB10 were purchased from Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (University of Iowa). These two monoclonal antibodies were prepared from hybridomas under identical conditions by fusing spleen cells from antigen-immunized mice with NS1 myeloma cells. IgG fractions were obtained by affinity purification on protein A-agarose. The antibody was added to medium at 2.8 μg/ml 1 h prior to applying mechanical stimulation to three-dimensional chondrocyte culture. For PTH functional assay, bovine parathyroid hormone (bPTH)-(1–34) and bovine PTH/PTHrP antagonist [Nle8,Nle18,Tyr34]bPTH-(3–34) were purchased from Sigma. Retrovirus that contained Ihh cDNA (Ihh-RCAS) was prepared by transfection of monolayer fibroblasts from 9-day chick embryonic dorsal skin using the calcium phosphate method as described previously (34Chen Q. Johnson D.M. Haudenschild D.R. Tondravi M.M. Goetinck P.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1743-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Monolayer chondrocytes were then infected with a thin layer of medium that contained the virus. After 2–3 days of infection, the infected chondrocytes were trypsinized and seeded in collagen sponges, which were subjected to mechanical stretch. The retrovirus infection efficiency in three-dimensional chondrocyte culture was determined by immunostaining of a viral protein. After 2 days of incubation, one sponge from each group was fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, embedded in OCT, and cut into 6-μm sections. Immunostaining of these sections were performed using the mAb 3C2 against viral gap protein and the mAb 5E1 against Hh as described previously (34Chen Q. Johnson D.M. Haudenschild D.R. Tondravi M.M. Goetinck P.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1743-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Immunostaining indicated that more than 90% of the chondrocytes in three-dimensional culture were virus-positive. Two types of control samples were included. Empty vector (RCAS) was used as a control for viral infections, and mock transfection (no DNA) was used for control of the transfection procedure. Transfection of cells by noggin-RCAS was carried out under the same condition as described above. Virus particles were then eliminated from the culture medium by Microcon 100 filtration (Amicon, Beverly, MA). The filtrate (10–250 μl) was mixed with 4.0 ml of stretch conditioned medium before adding into three-dimensional culture for further experiments. The concentration of noggin in the filtrate was estimated by SDS electrophoresis, with the filtrate from vector-transfected cells as negative control. A series of dilution of albumin (Pierce) was used as standard of protein concentration. It was estimated that the noggin concentration in the filtrate was 0.1 ng/μl. Total protein was extracted from cells in collagen sponges with or without stretch for indicated incubation periods, as previously described (27Wu Q. Chen Q. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 383-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Protein in the supernatant was quantified with a BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as standards. Twelve μg of protein was loaded on each lane, separated by 12% SDS-PAGE, and blotted with a mAb 5E1 against Hh, a pAb against both BMP 2/4 (Research Diagnostics, Flanders, NJ), and a pAb against only BMP 4 (Research Diagnostics) in phosphate-buffered saline plus Tween 20 containing 1% bovine serum albumin. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG (H+L) (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA), diluted 1:3000 in phosphate-buffered saline plus Tween 20, was used as a secondary antibody. Visualization of immunoreactive proteins was achieved by using the ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and by subsequently exposing the membrane to Kodak X-Omat AR film. The exposed film was scanned by a laser densitometer from Molecular Dynamics (Sunnyvale, CA). The protein signal intensity was quantified using discovery series Quantity One software from the Protein Data Base (Huntington, NY). We observed that, in the three-dimensional chondrocyte culture, mechanical stress from cyclic stretch-induced matrix deformation stimulated chondrocyte proliferation after 2 days of incubation (Fig. 1, 2d), as we reported previously (27Wu Q. Chen Q. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 383-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, we found that the mechanical stimulatory effect on chondrocyte proliferation was derived from the conditioned medium in which mechanical stretch of chondrocytes was conducted. When chondrocytes were incubated without mechanical load but in the presence of conditioned medium collected from 2-day stretched chondrocyte cultures, these cells had a 30% higher proliferation rate than those incubated in the conditioned medium from non-stretched chondrocytes (Fig. 1 A, 2d CM). Furthermore, the conditioned medium from stretched cells stimulated chondrocyte proliferation in a dosage-dependent manner (Fig. 1 B), reaching maximal activity at 40% (v/v). Thus, stretch-induced matrix deformation activated chondrocytes to synthesize and/or secrete factors into the medium, which in turn stimulated cell proliferation. This activity was sensitive to heat denaturation. After incubation at 85 °C for 2 h, the proliferation stimulatory activity was markedly reduced from the stretched-conditioned medium (data not shown). The presence of the activity within conditioned medium was dependent on the incubation period of chondrocyte culture. Conditioned medium collected after only 1 day of incubation under stretched conditions did not have stimulatory effects on chondrocyte proliferation (Fig. 1 A, 1d CM). Since chondrocytes undergo differentiation process during incubation in this culture system (27Wu Q. Chen Q. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 383-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), this suggests that only chondrocytes from a specific differentiation stage synthesize/release this activity upon mechanical stimulation. We noticed that the proliferation stimulatory activity appeared in conditioned medium at the 2nd day of incubation (Fig. 1 A). It coincided with the expression time point of cartilage matrix protein/matrilin-1, a marker of mature chondrocytes before hypertrophy (29Chen Q. Johnson D.M. Haudenschild D.R. Goetinck P.F. Dev. Biol. 1995; 172: 293-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), in this cell culture system (27Wu Q. Chen Q. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 383-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). This suggested that the activity might be associated with mature chondrocytes. It is known that Ihh, an important signaling molecule that regulates chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation, is synthesized specifically by mature chondrocytes before they become hypertrophic (14Vortkamp A. Lee K. Lanske B. Segre G.V. Kronenberg H.M. Tabin C.J. Science. 1996; 273: 613-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar). Thus, it prompted us to determine whether Ihh gene expression was activated by mechanical stress. We first quantified the levels of Ihh mRNA and protein in response to cyclic stretch. Ihh mRNA level at the 2nd day of mechanical loading was increased more than 18-fold in stretched chondrocytes in comparison to that of non-stretched cells, as measured by quantitative real-time RT-PCR (Fig. 2 A). This mechanical induction of Ihh mRNA was transient. The Ihh mRNA levels were similar between stretched and non-stretched cells during the 1st day of loading. After 6 days of loading, the Ihh mRNA of stretched cells returned to the basal level (Fig.2 A). Western blot analysis of chondrocyte lysates indicated that the 45-kDa Ihh protein was up-regulated by mechanical loading at both the 2nd and 4th days of incubation (Fig. 2 B), but the difference of the Ihh protein levels between stretched and non-stretched cells after the 2nd day of incubation was smaller, probably due to the transient nature of the stimulation. Furthermore, the mechanical induction of the Ihh mRNA was abolished by an SAC blocker gadolinium (Fig. 1 C), which has been shown previously to inhibit mechanically stimulated chondrocyte proliferation (27Wu Q. Chen Q. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 383-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Thus, the IHH gene is mechanoresponsive; its expression can be induced by cyclic mechanical stretch. Next, we tested whether Ihh was required for mechanical stimulation of chondrocyte proliferation. It has been shown previously that the presence of an Hh functional blocking monoclonal antibody 5E1 in culture completely inhibited the activity of Ihh, since chondrocytes only express Ihh but not other Hh molecules (14Vortkamp A. Lee K. Lanske B. Segre G.V. Kronenberg H.M. Tabin C.J. Science. 1996; 273: 613-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar). We added this antibody during cyclic stretch of chondrocytes. As shown in Fig.3 A, addition of the Ihh functional blocking antibody during stretch completely inhibited the mechanical stimulation of chondrocyte proliferation (Fig.3 A, anti-Hh). This inhibition was specific, because neither in the absence of the antibody (No Ab) nor in the presence of a control monoclonal antibody (Anti-Op) was chondrocyte proliferation inhibited. Therefore, Ihh is necessary for mechanical stimulation of chondrocyte proliferation. We next tested whether Ihh was sufficient for stimulating chondrocyte proliferation by itself. A full-length Ihh cDNA in a retroviral vector (Ihh-RCAS) was transfected into chondrocytes. Successful overexpression of Ihh-RCAS was determined by immunofluorescence (see “Materials and Methods”). Activation of the Ihh pathway in Ihh overexpressed cells was further indicated by the elevated mRNA level of patched (Ptc), an Ihh receptor whose expression was induced by Ihh (Fig.3 B). However, the extent of mechanical stimulation of proliferation was similar between Ihh-transfected cells and RCAS-transfected control cells (Fig. 3 B). Thus, although Ihh is necessary for transmitting mechanical signals to stimulate chondrocyte proliferation, it is not sufficient to replace mechanical signals. To test whether the activity in conditioned medium was related to Ihh, we collected conditioned medium from chondrocyte cultures in which Ihh functional blocking antibody was added during mechanical stretch. Blocking Ihh during mechanical stretch completely eliminated the activity in conditioned medium collected from stretched cells (Fig. 4 A,Anti-Hh), while the activity was still present in conditioned medium from cells stretched in the presence of a control mAb, or no antibody (Fig. 4 A). This suggested that the activity in conditioned medium was either Ihh or some signaling molecules downstream in the Ihh pathway. To distinguish these two possibilities, we collected medium from cells stretched in the absence of any antibodies, and then added the anti-Hh antibody 5E1 into the medium. When chondrocytes were incubated in such medium, addition of mAb 5E1 did not block the proliferation stimulatory activity within the medium (Fig. 4 B, compare S+Anti-Hh toS), although 5E1 was effective in inhibiting Ihh as shown by reduced level of Ptc mRNA (Fig. 4 B,S+Anti-Hh). In addition, we could not detect any Ihh protein in conditioned medium from stretched chondrocytes (data not shown). These data suggested that the activity was not Ihh per se, but downstream molecule(s) in the Ihh signaling pathway, whose synthesis and/or secretion into the medium depend on Ihh. To determine whether PTHrP was the downstream molecule to regulate chondrocyte proliferation, we first determined the effect of PTH/PTHrP on cell proliferation and the inhibition of such an effect by a PTH/PTHrP antagonist. When chondrocytes were cultured in the presence of 0.1 μmbovine PTH-(1–34), proliferation of cells was stimulated (Fig.5 A). The addition of a PTH/PTHrP antagonist [Nle8,Nle18,Tyr34]PTH-(3–34) at 0.5 μm diminished the stimulatory effect of bPTH-(1–34) (Fig. 5 A). Thus, this PTH/PTHrP antagonist inhibited chondrocyte proliferation stimulated by PTH/PTHrP. To test whether PTHrP accounted for the activity in the conditioned medium, the PTH/PTHrP antagonist was added to the stretch conditioned medium. The presence of PTH/PTHrP antagonist did not block the proliferation stimulatory activity in conditioned medium (Fig. 5 B). Thus, PTH/PTHrP did not account for the activity. When PTH/PTHrP antagonist was added directly into a chondrocyte culture undergoing cyclic matrix deformation, mechano-induced chondrocyte proliferation was not inhibited either (data not shown). Taken together, we concluded that mechanical regulation of chondrocyte proliferation was PTHrP-independent. To test whether BMPs were up-regulated by mechanical stress through induction of Ihh, we analyzed the levels of BMP 2/4, the vertebrate homologues of DPP, in conditioned media. We found that the level of BMP 2/4 in chondrocyte-conditioned medium was significantly up-regulated by mechanical stretch (Fig. 6 A). This up-regulation was reduced by the presence of the anti-Hh during mechanical stimulation (Fig. 6 A). Thus, up-regulation of BMP 2/4 by mechanical stress depended at least partially on the induction of Ihh. To test whether up-regulation of BMP in conditioned medium was necessary for the proliferation-stimulating activity, we examined the effect of BMP antagonist noggin (26Brunet L.J. McMahon J.A. McMahon A.P. Harland R.M. Science. 1998; 280: 1455-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar) on the mechanically stimulated chondrocyte proliferation. First, we transfected noggin-RCAS cDNA into chondrocytes that underwent mechanical stretch. Transfection of noggin cDNA completely abolished the mechanical stimulatory effect, whereas mock transfection or transfection of empty RCAS vector did not (Fig. 6 B). Second, we incubated chondrocytes in stretch conditioned medium to which various volumes of noggin medium prepared from noggin-transfected fibroblast culture was added. The noggin medium inhibited the proliferation stimulatory activity within stretch conditioned medium in a dose-dependent manner, whereas addition of noggin medium to non-stretch conditioned medium did not have appreciable effects (Fig. 6 C). These data indicate that noggin-sensitive BMPs are essential for mechano-induction of chondrocyte proliferation. Mechanical stress plays an essential role in skeletal development and remodeling. The presence of cyclic mechanical stress stimulates bone formation, whereas the lack of it leads to bone resorption (10Kim Y.J. Sah R.L. Grodzinsky A.J. Plaas A.H. Sandy J.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 311: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar,35Turner C.H. Bone. 1991; 12: 203-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). It has been shown that mechanical stress signals are transduced to the cells from extracellular environment through deformation of extracellular matrix (3Tavernarakis N. Driscoll M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 659-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). However, the intracellular pathways that sense and transduce mechanical signals remain unclear. The hedgehog protein families have been identified as key morphogens during skeletal development and regeneration (13McMahon A.P. Cell. 2000; 100: 185-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Among Hh, Sonic hedgehog is involved in early limb patterning whereas Ihh is involved in late limb development by regulating chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation. In this study, these two important biological processes, mechanotransduction and skeletal morphogenesis, are connected by Ihh. We show here that Ihh is induced by cyclic mechanical stress from matrix deformation, and functions as an autocrine signal to transduce and amplify mechanical stimulation of chondrocyte proliferation. Although it is well established that Ihh plays an important role in regulating cartilage formation, it is not known how Ihh itself is induced. We show here that one of the induction signals is mechanical stress from matrix deformation. This transient induction of Ihh mRNA is more than 18-fold, which makes IHH as one of the most dynamic mechanoresponsive genes. This induction may be dependent on SACs in the chondrocyte membrane, since SAC inhibitor gadolinium abolishes the Ihh mRNA increase by mechanical loading. Previously, we have shown that mechanical stimulation of chondrocyte proliferation can be inhibited by gadolinium (27Wu Q. Chen Q. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 383-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Thus, mechanical stimulation of chondrocyte proliferation may be achieved by induction of Ihh mRNA via gadolinium-sensitive SACs. Our data also suggest that mechanical induction of Ihh depends on differentiation stages of chondrocytes. The Ihh mRNA level was not mechanically induced in either immature chondrocytes (Fig. 2, Day 1) or late hypertrophic chondrocytes (Fig. 2, Day 8) (27Wu Q. Chen Q. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 383-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) despite the presence of mechanical signals. Thus, only mature chondrocytes, which synthesize low level of Ihh intrinsically, may be mechanically induced to synthesize higher level of Ihh. Our data indicate that Ihh is essential but not sufficient for up-regulating chondrocyte proliferation. This is consistent with previous observations that elimination of the IHH gene decreases chondrocyte proliferation (17St-Jacques B. Hammerschmidt M. McMahon A.P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2072-2086Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar), whereas overexpression of Ihh alone in growth plates does not increase chondrocyte proliferation (14Vortkamp A. Lee K. Lanske B. Segre G.V. Kronenberg H.M. Tabin C.J. Science. 1996; 273: 613-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar). One explanation is that chondrocyte proliferation is regulated by Ihh and some other factors. Thus, inhibition of Ihh alone affects chondrocyte proliferation, whereas reconstitution of the proliferation activity requires other factors in addition to Ihh. Given the complexity and the multifactorial nature of mechanotransduction complex (3Tavernarakis N. Driscoll M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 659-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), it is not surprising that the complex contains other factors besides Ihh. Our data further suggest that the effect of Ihh on chondrocyte proliferation may be mediated by a downstream factor(s) in the Ihh pathway. This factor is not Ihh per se, because no Ihh could be detected in conditioned medium from stretched chondrocytes where the proliferation stimulation activity resides. This is consistent with the observation that Hh peptides are not secreted into the medium, because they are tethered to the membrane extracellularly by a cholesterol motif (13McMahon A.P. Cell. 2000; 100: 185-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Instead, this factor may be induced by Ihh, because blocking of Ihh function by a mAb eliminates the activity in conditioned medium completely. Our data suggest that this factor is not PTH/PTHrP, but BMP. Although both classes of molecules have been shown to be induced by Ihh in cartilage (20Lanske B. Karaplis A.C. Lee K. Luz A. Vortkamp A. Pirro A. Karperien M. Defize L.H.K. Ho C. Mulligan R.C. Abou-Samra A.B. Juppner H. Segre G.V. Kronenberg H.M. Science. 1996; 273: 663-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar, 18Pathi S. Rutenberg J.B. Johnson R.L. Vortkamp A. Dev. Biol. 1999; 209: 239-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), the inhibition of BMPs by their antagonist noggin abolishes the mechanical stimulation of chondrocyte proliferation, whereas the inhibition of PTH/PTHrP by their antagonist has no effect. In particular, we identified BMP 2/4 as the molecules that were up-regulated by mechanical stress in an Ihh-dependent manner. In support of our data, previous studies have shown that 1) BMP 2/4 are the closest homologues of DPP, which lies downstream of Hh in the Drosophila signaling pathway (24Fietz M.J. Concordet J.P. Barbosa R. Johnson R. Krauss S. McMahon A.P. Tabin C. Ingham P.W. Development. 1994; suppl.: 43-51Google Scholar, 25Tanimoto H. Itoh S. ten Dijke P. Tabata T. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 59-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar); 2) BMP 2/4 have the highest affinity for BMP antagonist noggin (26Brunet L.J. McMahon J.A. McMahon A.P. Harland R.M. Science. 1998; 280: 1455-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar), which abolished the mechanical stimulatory effect in our study; and 3) BMP 2/4 have been identified to be up-regulated by mechanical loading in vivo (36Sato M. Ochi T. Nakase T. Hirota S. Kitamura Y. Nomura S. Yasui N. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 1084-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). BMPs have been shown previously to have proliferative effects on chondrocytes (37Suzuki F. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1992; 324: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Conversely, it has also been shown that expression of a dominant-negative BMP receptor actually increased chondrocyte proliferation (38Enomotoiwamoto M. Iwamoto M. Mukudai Y. Kawakami Y. Nohno T. Higuchi Y. Takemoto S. Ohuchi H. Noji S. Kurisu K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 409-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Thus, BMP pathways may stimulate or inhibit cell proliferation depending on cellular context,i.e. whether other BMP-independent pathways are also activated by extracellular signals (39Hogan B.L.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1580-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar). For example, we found that mechanical stress also activated mitogen-activated protein kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway, which was essential for stimulating chondrocyte proliferation. 2Q. Wu and Q. Chen, unpublished data. Thus, the Ihh-BMP 2/4 pathway and other pathways may act together to regulate chondrocyte proliferation. The complete elucidation of these different mechanotransduction pathways awaits further experimentation such as microarray analysis. Based on our data, we suggest that the mechanotransduction process can be divided into two stages. In the first stage, mechanical signals resulting from cyclic matrix deformation induce the gene expression of Ihh by chondrocytes, among activation of other genes. During this stage, mechanical stress signals are converted to chemical signals. In the second stage, Ihh may induce BMPs that participate in stimulation of cartilage growth under permissive environment. During this stage, chemical signals are converted to biological responses. Thus, Ihh may serve as a critical link to a pathway that connects mechanical signals and the activity of cells in response to those signals. This newly discovered function of Ihh may be important not only for skeleton formation during development, but also for fracture healing in the adult. First, during endochondral bone formation, Ihh is expressed exclusively by prehypertrophic mature chondrocytes that separate proliferating cells from hypertrophic cells in a growth plate. It has been shown previously that Ihh inhibited neighboring chondrocytes undergoing hypertrophy at the distal end of the growth plate. Our study shows Ihh may also promote proliferation of the neighboring cells at the proximal end of the growth plate. This is also supported by the phenotype of Ihh knockout mouse, in which chondrocyte proliferation is severely retarded (17St-Jacques B. Hammerschmidt M. McMahon A.P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2072-2086Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar). Second, although Ihh mRNA expression ceases when a growth plate is closed, its expression is re-activated during fracture healing in adult (15Vortkamp A. Pathi S. Peretti G.M. Caruso E.M. Zaleske D.J. Tabin C.J. Mech. Dev. 1998; 71: 65-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 16Ferguson C. Alpern E. Miclau T. Helms J.A. Mech. Dev. 1999; 87: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that Ihh is an essential mediator that connects mechanical stress to chondrocyte proliferation. Thus, Ihh may play an important role in sustaining and amplifying mechanical signals to promote cartilage and bone remodeling in adult as well. This hypothesis remains to be tested.

Elevated levels of homocysteine are correlated with cardiovascular diseases, neural tube defects, and Alzheimer's disease (1Refsum H. Ueland P.M. Nygard O. Vollset S.E. Annu. Rev. Med. 1998; 49: 31-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1833) Google Scholar, 2Mills J.L. McPartlin J.M. Kirke P.N. Lee Y.J. Conle M.R. Weir D.G.

Intracellular levels of homocysteine are kept low by the action of two classes of reactions. The transmethylation reactions catalyzed by methionine synthase or betaine homocysteine methyltransferase salvage homocysteine back to the methionine cycle. Alternatively, the β-replacement reaction catalyzed by cystathionine β-synthase commits homocysteine to the trans sulfuration pathway and provides a mechanism for generating cysteine from the essential amino acid, methionine. Of the two transmethylases, betaine homocysteine methyltransferase has a relatively restricted tissue distribution, whereas methionine synthase is believed to be ubiquitous (5Finkelstein J.D. Martin J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9508-9513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The mammalian methionine synthase is a methylcobalamin-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the successive transfer of a methyl group from CH3-H4folate1to the cob(I)alamin form of the cofactor and from methylcobalamin to homocysteine to form methionine and tetrahydrofolate as products (Fig.1) (6Banerjee R. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 175-186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The reactivity of the intermediate cob(I)alamin form of the enzyme renders the enzyme susceptible to oxidation, resulting in adventitious formation of cob(II)alamin. The latter represents an inactive form of the enzyme that can be returned to the catalytic cycle by a reductive methylation reaction that utilizes S-adenosylmethionine as a methyl group donor. In bacteria, the physiological reducing system is comprised of two flavoproteins, NADPH-flavodoxin (or ferredoxin) oxidoreductase and flavodoxin, that relay electrons from NADPH to methionine synthase (Fig. 2) (7Fujii K.

Prior to this study, the ability of only the P-450 reductase/soluble cytochrome b 5 system to reconstitute methionine synthase activity had been demonstrated biochemically. In principle, methionine synthase reductase could function either independently or in the presence of soluble cytochromeb 5 to activate methionine synthase. The role, if any, of the dual flavoprotein, NR1, in this pathway is unknown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Three years ago, two studies, using genetic and biochemical approaches, respectively, identified two pathways for mammalian methionine synthase activation (Fig. 2). Using a homology-based PCR approach, Gravel and co-workers (10Leclerc D. Wilson A. Dumas R. Gafuik C. Song D. Watkins D. Heng H.H.Q. Rommens J.M. Scherer S.W. Rosenblatt D.S. Gravel R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3059-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) were able to clone a soluble P-450-reductase-like protein and named it methionine-synthase reductase. The predicted amino acid sequence from the cDNA is homologous at the N terminus to the flavodoxin-like FMN-containing domain and linked by a hinge region to an NADPH-flavodoxin oxidoreductase-like FAD and a NADPH-binding domain found in cytochrome P-450 reductase. The sole but compelling evidence for the relevance of this putative protein in methionine synthase activation came from the identification of mutations in fibroblasts from cblE patients with functional methionine synthase deficiency (10Leclerc D. Wilson A. Dumas R. Gafuik C. Song D. Watkins D. Heng H.H.Q. Rommens J.M. Scherer S.W. Rosenblatt D.S. Gravel R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3059-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 11Wilson A. Leclerc D. Rosenblatt D.S. Gravel R.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 2009-2016Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Biochemical and genetic characterization had earlier indicated that mutations in these cell lines were not in the gene encoding methionine synthase (which belong to the cblGcomplementation group) and were likely to be associated with the reductive activation system (12Watkins D. Rosenblatt D.S. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1989; 34: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 13Gulati S. Brody L.C. Rosenblatt D.S. Banerjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19171-19175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, biochemical characterization of the gene product and indeed its ability to activate methionine synthase were not investigated.Biochemical investigations of the mammalian reductive activation system in our laboratory were based on reconstitution of the activation system in the presence of NADPH by combinations of different fractions from cell homogenates (13Gulati S. Brody L.C. Rosenblatt D.S. Banerjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19171-19175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Purification of one of these components resulted in its identification as soluble cytochrome b 5and indicated that the second component was microsomal (14Chen Z. Banerjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26248-26255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This suggested the involvement of P-450 reductase and, indeed, methionine synthase activity could be reconstituted completely under in vitro conditions by the addition of purified P-450 reductase and soluble cytochrome b 5.These reports raised the following unresolved questions as depicted in Fig. 2. Can the putative methionine synthase reductase activate methionine synthase? Does soluble cytochromeb 5 play a role in methionine synthase reductase-mediated activation of methionine synthase? Is the cytochromeb 5/P-450 reductase two-component activation system physiologically relevant, particularly because the proximal electron acceptor from NADPH, P-450 reductase, is microsomal, and the electron acceptor, methionine synthase, is soluble? As a first step toward answering these questions, we have cloned and expressed the human cDNA encoding methionine synthase reductase and characterized its basic properties. Our results demonstrate that methionine synthase reductase is a dual flavoprotein that is sufficient for supporting methionine synthase activity in the presence of NADPH.DISCUSSIONFunctional deficiency of methionine synthase is inherited as an autosomal recessive disorder. It is accompanied by pleiotropic clinical presentations including hyperhomocysteinemia with attendant severe cardiovascular problems, hypomethioninemia, megaloblastic anemia, and developmental delay (29Rosenblatt D.S. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. Inherited Disorders of Folate Transport and Metabolism. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 2049-2061Google Scholar). In principle, an isolated functional deficiency of methionine synthase could arise from defects in the enzyme itself or in the reductive activation system (30Shevell M.I. Rosenblatt D.S. Can. J. Neurol. Sci. 1992; 19: 472-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Consistent with this expectation, two distinct genetic complementation groups have been recognized in patients: cblG with defects in methionine synthase and cblE with defects in the reductive activation system (12Watkins D. Rosenblatt D.S. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1989; 34: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). This has been confirmed by the recent cloning and mutation identification in the genes encoding methionine synthase (31Gulati S.G. Baker P. Fowler B. Li Y. Kruger W. Brody L.C. Banerjee R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 1859-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 32Leclerc D. Campeau E. Goyette P. Adjalla C.E. Christensen B. Ross M. Eydoux P. Rosenblatt D.S. Rozen R. Gravel R.A. Hum. Mol.

Genet. 1999; 8: 2009-2016Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), respectively. However, the possibility of a third complementation group has been raised recently based on characterization of a patient cell line with functional methionine synthase deficiency (33Fowler B. Suormala T. Gunther M. Till J. Wraith J.E. J. Inher. Dis. 1997; 20: 21Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that additional or alternative components may be involved in the function of methionine synthase in vivo.Studies with patient cell lines are directly relevant to the issue of the nature of the physiological reducing system for the mammalian methionine synthase. The recent description of methionine synthase reductase (10Leclerc D. Wilson A. Dumas R. Gafuik C. Song D. Watkins D. Heng H.H.Q. Rommens J.M. Scherer S.W. Rosenblatt D.S. Gravel R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3059-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) and the soluble cytochromeb 5/P-450 reductase system (14Chen Z. Banerjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26248-26255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) point to the involvement of two related mammalian proteins, which represent the evolutionary fusion product of the bacterial reductive activation system, flavodoxin, and NADPH-flavodoxin oxidoreductase (34Porter T.D. Kasper C.B. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1682-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 35Wang M. Roberts D.L. Paschke R. Shea T.M. Masters B.S.S. Kim J.-J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8411-8416Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). However, they also raise several questions, in particular, whether or not a unique reductive activation system for methionine synthase exists in mammals and whether the soluble cytochromeb 5/P-450 reductase system is physiologically relevant. Methionine synthase has been shown to be an essential gene in mice and a homozygous knockout of this gene results in embryonic lethality (36Swanson D.A. Liu M.L. Baker P.J. Garrett L. Stitzel M. Wu J. Harris M. Banerjee R. Shane B. Brody L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1058-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Hence the stakes are high for maintaining active methionine synthase. The reported existence of functionally null mutations in patients with the cblG variant form of methionine synthase deficiency (37Wilson A. Leclerc D. Saberi F. Campeau E. Hwang H.Y. Shane B. Phillips III, J.A. Rosenblatt D.S. Gravel R.A. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 63: 409-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) is controversial, because low levels of methionine synthase activity have been measured in some of these cell lines (13Gulati S. Brody L.C. Rosenblatt D.S. Banerjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19171-19175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This discrepancy may be explained by the possibility that normal splicing occurs at a low frequency giving rise to very low levels of wild type enzyme because one allele in each of these cell lines carries a mutation that is expected to unmask cryptic splice sites leading to functionally null phenotypes.As a first step toward resolving the many open questions regarding the components of the physiological reducing system of mammalian methionine synthase, we have cloned, expressed, and characterized the putative human methionine synthase reductase. The latter is one of a small number of dual flavoproteins, a family that includes cytochrome P-450 reductase (22Iyanagi T. Mason H.S.

The predicted multidomainal organization of methionine synthase reductase is also suggested by its proteolytic lability during purification that results in the generation of two fragments (not shown) and contributes to the low yield following the limited proteolysis step (Table I).Table IPurification summary of recombinant methionine synthase reductaseProcedureTotal proteinTotal units1-aProgressive enrichment of the cytochrome c reductase activity is reported in this table.S.A.

Open table in a new tab Recombinant human methionine synthase reductase is isolated with an equimolar content of FAD and FMN and an absorption spectrum that is consistent with the presence of fully oxidized flavin (Fig. 4). Reduction with NADPH under aerobic conditions results in the appearance of long wavelength absorption consistent with the formation of an air stable semiquinone as seen with P-450 reductase. Methionine synthase reductase catalyzes the reduction of cytochrome c, with a specific activity that is comparable with that of NR1 (28Paine M.J. Garner A.P. Powell D. Sibbald J. Sales M. Pratt N.

Kasper C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41087-41091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).In contrast to the two component P-450 reductase/soluble cytochromeb 5 system, methionine synthase reductase alone is capable of fully supporting NADPH-dependent activity of methionine synthase under in vitro conditions (TableII). Indeed, the addition of soluble cytochrome b 5 has no effect on this activity. This result excludes one of the pathways that had been considered earlier (42Banerjee R. Robinson K. Molecular Biology of Methionine Synthase: Interrelationships with Homocysteine and Vascular Disease. Kluwyer, Amsterdam2000: 291-311Google Scholar) by demonstrating that, at least under in vitroconditions, cytochrome b 5 plays no role in methionine synthase reductase-dependent activation of methionine synthase (Fig. 2).Extensive structure function studies of the E. colimethionine synthase suggest that major domain movements accompany the transition from the catalytically active to inactive state (43Hall D.A. Jordan-Starck T.C. Loo R.O. Ludwig M.L. Matthews R.G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10711-10719Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Thus, under turnover conditions, the N-terminal substrate binding domains must interact with the central B12-binding domain, whereas under activation conditions, the C-terminalS-adenosylmethionine-binding domain, flavodoxin, and the B12-binding domain form a complex. It is therefore not surprising that the activity of methionine synthase, even in the absence of a physiological reducing partner, shows an ionic strength dependence (Fig. 5). The different conformations are expected to involve surface interactions between the respective domains, and indeed cross-linking and modeling studies have revealed the importance of surfacial electrostatic interactions in the activation conformation (43Hall D.A. Jordan-Starck T.C. Loo R.O. Ludwig M.L. Matthews R.G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10711-10719Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, the ionic strength dependence of methionine synthase in the presence of methionine synthase reductase is distinct from that in the presence of exogenous reductants such as DTT and B12and displays a narrow range within which activity is optimal. At physiologically relevant concentrations of the reduced pyridine nucleotides, methionine synthase reductase is expected to utilize NADPH almost exclusively (Fig. 6). The K m for NADPH (2.6 ± 0.5 μm) is comparable with that reported for recombinant rat liver cytochrome P-450 reductase (6.2 ± 0.7 μm) (41Shen A.L. Kasper C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41087-41091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).The methionine synthase reductase-dependent activity of methionine synthase shows saturation kinetics with aK act of methionine synthase reductase of 80.7 ± 13.7 nm. This is higher than theK m for flavodoxin (∼5 nm) for theE. coli methionine synthase (7Fujii K. Galivan J.H. Huennekens F.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 178: 662-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Maximal activity is observed at a stoichiometry of ∼4 methionine synthase reductase/methionine synthase, suggesting that the binding interactions between these two proteins is weaker than that of the corresponding redox pair in E. coli, where a ratio of 1 has been reported (7Fujii K. Galivan J.H. Huennekens F.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 178: 662-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar).In summary, these studies report on the expression and characterization of recombinant human methionine synthase reductase, a function that has only been deduced previously based on its predicted sequence and identification of mutations in cblE patient cell lines. We demonstrate that methionine synthase reductase is fully capable of supporting methionine synthase activity in the presence of NADPH and that it is a member of the growing family of dual flavoproteins. The issue of whether or not methionine synthase reductase represents the sole physiologically relevant pathway for activation of methionine synthase remains open with other candidate pathways remaining to be evaluated. Homocysteine is a key junction metabolite in the methionine cycle that is formed by the hydrolysis of S-adenosylhomocysteine, the product ofS-adenosylmethionine-dependent methylation reactions. Elevated levels of homocysteine are correlated with cardiovascular diseases, neural tube defects, and Alzheimer's disease (1Refsum H. Ueland P.M. Nygard O. Vollset S.E. Annu. Rev. Med. 1998; 49: 31-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1833) Google Scholar, 2Mills J.L. McPartlin J.M. Kirke P.N. Lee Y.J. Conle M.R. Weir D.G.

Intracellular levels of homocysteine are kept low by the action of two classes of reactions. The transmethylation reactions catalyzed by methionine synthase or betaine homocysteine methyltransferase salvage homocysteine back to the methionine cycle. Alternatively, the β-replacement reaction catalyzed by cystathionine β-synthase commits homocysteine to the trans sulfuration pathway and provides a mechanism for generating cysteine from the essential amino acid, methionine. Of the two transmethylases, betaine homocysteine methyltransferase has a relatively restricted tissue distribution, whereas methionine synthase is believed to be ubiquitous (5Finkelstein J.D. Martin J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9508-9513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mammalian methionine synthase is a methylcobalamin-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the successive transfer of a methyl group from CH3-H4folate1to the cob(I)alamin form of the cofactor and from methylcobalamin to homocysteine to form methionine and tetrahydrofolate as products (Fig.1) (6Banerjee R. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 175-186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The reactivity of the intermediate cob(I)alamin form of the enzyme renders the enzyme susceptible to oxidation, resulting in adventitious formation of cob(II)alamin. The latter represents an inactive form of the enzyme that can be returned to the catalytic cycle by a reductive methylation reaction that utilizes S-adenosylmethionine as a methyl group donor. In bacteria, the physiological reducing system is comprised of two flavoproteins, NADPH-flavodoxin (or ferredoxin) oxidoreductase and flavodoxin, that relay electrons from NADPH to methionine synthase (Fig. 2) (7Fujii K. Galivan J.H. Huennekens F.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 178: 662-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 8Fujii K. Huennekens F.M. J. Biol.

Methionine Synthase: Characterization of Protein Components and Mechanisms for Activation and Catalysis. Japan Scientific Societies, Tokyo, Japan1979: 173-183Google Scholar). Mammals lack flavodoxin, and until recently the physiological reducing system was completely unknown. Three years ago, two studies, using genetic and biochemical approaches, respectively, identified two pathways for mammalian methionine synthase activation (Fig. 2). Using a homology-based PCR approach, Gravel and co-workers (10Leclerc D. Wilson A. Dumas R. Gafuik C. Song D. Watkins D. Heng H.H.Q. Rommens J.M. Scherer S.W. Rosenblatt D.S. Gravel R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3059-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) were able to clone a soluble P-450-reductase-like protein and named it methionine-synthase reductase. The predicted amino acid sequence from the cDNA is homologous at the N terminus to the flavodoxin-like FMN-containing domain and linked by a hinge region to an NADPH-flavodoxin oxidoreductase-like FAD and a NADPH-binding domain found in cytochrome P-450 reductase. The sole but compelling evidence for the relevance of this putative protein in methionine synthase activation came from the identification of mutations in fibroblasts from cblE patients with functional methionine synthase deficiency (10Leclerc D. Wilson A. Dumas R. Gafuik C. Song D. Watkins D. Heng H.H.Q. Rommens J.M. Scherer S.W. Rosenblatt D.S. Gravel R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemical and genetic characterization had earlier indicated that mutations in these cell lines were not in the gene encoding methionine synthase (which belong to the cblGcomplementation group) and were likely to be associated with the reductive activation system (12Watkins D.

In wound healing, intercellular contacts involving interactions between cadherins, actin, and myosin have been implicated in generating the forces required for wound closure (5Adams C.L. Nelson W.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 572-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Notably, maintenance of the structure of intercellular contacts critically depends upon contractile forces generated by the actin cytoskeleton (6Gloushankova N.A Krendel M.F. Alieva N.O. Bonder E.M. Feder H.H. Vasiliev J.M. Gelfand I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4362-4367Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) that act on intercellular contacts in adjacent cells (7Danjo Y. Gipson I.K. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3323-3332PubMed Google Scholar). Collectively, these data suggest that force application to intercellular junctions is of central importance in tissue homeostasis, but the specific role of intercellular junctional proteins in transducing physical forces into regulatory signals is poorly understood. Tension transmitted through adherens junctions can change the viscoelastic properties of fibroblasts (8Ragsdale G.K. Phelps J. Luby-Phelps K. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 2798-2808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and may initiate intercellular mechanotransduction via calcium wave propagation through gap junctions (9Boitano S. Sanderson M.J. Dirksen E.R. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3037-3044PubMed Google Scholar, 10Hansen M. Boitano S. Dirksen E.R. Sanderson M.J. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 108: 2583-2590Google Scholar, 11Xia S.L. Ferrier J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 1212-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). However, mechanotransduction through intercellular adherens junctions of connective tissue cells has not been examined in detail. Consequently the mechanisms of force-sensing and signal transduction at intercellular junctions remain largely unknown. Studies of biomechanical stimulation to intercellular junctions have typically used fluid flow stress or stretching of deformable substrates to apply forces to confluent cell monolayers. For example, endothelial cells exhibit profound changes in cell shape in response to altered shear stress, and these responses require reorganization of intercellular adherens junctions (12Noria S. Cowan D.B. Gotlieb A.I. Langille B.L. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 504-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear whether the morphological changes of intercellular junctions observed in these and related experiments were a direct result of force application to the junctions or were secondary to alterations in cell-substratum adhesions. Further, the nature of the signals that are generated as a result of direct mechanical stimulation of intercellular adhesions remains elusive. To test whether intercellular adhesion complexes can transmit mechanical signals, we developed and characterized a novel model system that delivers controlled physical forces (∼30–150 pN)1 to intercellular junctions, and we measured [Ca2+]i when these junctions were stretched. We used fibroblasts from periodontal connective tissues because these cells form extensive intercellular adherens and gap junctions in vivo (13Beertsen W. Everts V. J. Periodont. Res. 1980; 16: 524-541Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 14Shore R.C. Berkovitz B.K.B. Moxham B. J. Anat. 1981; 133: 67-76PubMed Google Scholar) and in vitro (15Ko K. Arora P. Lee W. McCulloch C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C147-C157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further, periodontal cells are subjected constitutively to high amplitude mechanical loads in vivo. With the use of specific gap junction inhibitors and anti-cadherin antibody-coated magnetic beads, we delineated the role of cadherin-mediated adherens junctions in intercellular mechanotransduction. Our major finding is that mechanical forces applied to intercellular junctions induce robust intracellular calcium transients independent of gap junctions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study showing that forces transmitted specifically through cadherins can activate a second messenger system and induce actin polymerization at force application sites. Primary antibodies against human proteins included mouse monoclonal anti-β-catenin (Clone 14), FITC-conjugated anti-CD90 (Clone 5E10), anti-pan-cadherin (Clone CH-19) (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), anti-N-cadherin (anti-A-cell adhesion molecule; Clone GC-4), anti-COX-1, and FITC-goat anti-mouse antibodies (Sigma). Rhodamine-phalloidin, cytochalasin D, thapsigargin, magnetite beads, ATP, manganese chloride, gadolinium chloride, and β-glycyrrhetinic acid were purchased from Sigma. 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole, HCl, Alexa Fluor 488 phalloidin, BAPTA/AM, Calcein/AM, fura-2/AM, and mag-fura-2 were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Rhodamine-labeled monomeric actin was purchased from Cytoskeleton (Denver, CO). BioMag goat anti-mouse IgG (Fc specific) coated magnetic particles were purchased from Polysciences (Warrington, PA). Propidium iodide was purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Connexin 43 mimetic peptides including GAP 20 (amino acid sequence EIKKFKYGC) and GAP 27 (amino acid sequence SRPTEKTIFII) were synthesized by the Alberta Peptide Institute (Edmonton, Canada). Human gingival fibroblasts were derived from primary explant cultures as described (16Pender N. McCulloch C.A. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 100: 187-193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cells from passages 6–10 were grown as monolayers in T-75 flasks. Full growth medium consisted of α-minimal essential medium (α-MEM), antibiotics (0.017% penicillin G (Ayerst Laboratory, Montreal, Canada), 0.01% gentamycin sulfate (Life Technologies, Inc.), in α-MEM), and 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (ICN Biomedicals, Costa Mesa, CA). The cells were grown to confluence prior to all experiments except when sparse cultures were used as indicated. To identify and localize specific molecules involved in cell-to-cell adhesion, immunocytochemistry was performed for cadherins (using pan-cadherin antibody) and β-catenin. Cells grown on coverslips were fixed and permeabilized with methanol at −20 °C for 10 min, blocked with 1:1000 mouse serum in PBS for 10 min, and incubated with primary antibody (1:100 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature, washed three times with PBS containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin, and incubated with FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse (1:100). Nonspecific control staining was performed on a separate coverslip using an irrelevant isotype control antibody and secondary antibody. Laser scanning confocal microscopy was used to locate and quantify adhesive proteins at the intercellular interface between suspended (S) and substrate-attached (A) cells as described (17Ko K. Arora P. Bhide V. Chen A. McCulloch C. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1155-1167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For FITC-labeled antibodies, excitation was set at 488 nm, and emission was collected with a 530/20 nm barrier filter. The cells were imaged with a 63× oil immersion lens (numerical aperture = 1.4), and transverse optical sections were obtained from the level of cell attachment at the substratum of the A cell to the dorsal surface of the S cell (as verified by phase contrast microscopy). The cell-to-cell interface was estimated to be located at about the middle optical section between the cells and further verified by visual assessment of the position of the nuclei of the top and bottom cells (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, HCl staining). For measurement of whole cell intracellular calcium ion concentration ([Ca2+]i), the cells on coverslips were loaded at 37 °C with 3 μm fura-2/AM for 20 min. For estimation of ER calcium stores, the cells were incubated with mag-fura-2/AM (4 μm) (18Hofer A.M. Landolfi B. Debellis L. Pozzan T. Curci S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1986-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) for 150 min at 37 °C, in α-MEM containing fetal bovine serum (10%) (19Golovina V.A. Blaustein M.P. Science. 1997; 275: 1643-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). The calcium-free buffer is composed of 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 10 mmd-glucose, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm Na2HPO4, and 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, with an osmolarity of 291 mOsmol. For experiments requiring external calcium, 1 mm CaC12 was added to the buffer. The attached cells on coverslips were washed twice and transferred to a tissue culture chamber (Corning, Corning, NY). After incubation with fura-2/AM, inspection of cells by fluorescence microscopy demonstrated no vesicular compartmentalization of fura-2, suggesting that the dye loading method allows measurement of cytosolic [Ca2+]i. Visual inspection of mag-fura-2-loaded cells showed fluorescent labeling of discrete intracellular organelles. Whole cell [Ca2+]i measurements were obtained with a Nikon Diaphot II inverted microscope optically interfaced to a Deltascan 4000, dual beam, epifluorescence spectrofluorimeter, and analysis system (Photon Technology Int., London, Canada). The dual excitation fluorochromes fura-2 or mag-fura-2 were excited at alternating wavelengths of 346 and 380 nm from dual monochromators with slit widths set at 2 nm. Emitted fluorescence was collected with a 40× quartz 1.32 numerical aperture oil immersion Nikon Fluor objective and passed through a 530/20 nm barrier filter (Omega Optical, Brattleboro, VT). A variable aperture, intrabeam mask was used to restrict measurements to single cells. Estimates of [Ca2+]i independent of the precise intracellular concentration of fura-2 were calculated from dual excitation emitted fluorescence according to the equation of Grynkiewicz et al.(20Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and as described earlier (21Ko K. Glogauer M. McCulloch C.A. Ellen R.P. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 703-709Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). [Ca2+]itransients of S cells and A cells were measured in separate experiments. Ferric oxide microparticles (Fe3O4; Aldrich) were sonicated to eliminate clumps. Particles exhibited a heterogeneous size distribution with a pronounced modal peak at ∼5 μm. Beads were rinsed in PBS, washed three times, and resuspended in Ca2+-Mg2+-free phosphate buffered saline. An aliquot (0.5 g) of beads was resuspended in 0.7 ml of α-MEM to make a final volume of 1 ml. For preparation of S cells with internalized beads, 30 μl containing 15 mg of beads were incubated overnight with a confluent cell layer on a 60-mm tissue culture dish (∼6 × 105 cells/dish) so that the bead-to-cell ratio was ∼100:1). The S cell layer was washed five times with Ca2+-Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline to remove any unbound or noninternalized beads. These cells were then trypsinized to remove beads bound on the outside of the cell, neutralized with growth medium, and resuspended in growth medium. Previous studies (22McKeown M. Knowles G. McCulloch C.A. Cell Tissue Res. 1990; 262: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 23Knowles G.C. McKeown M. Sodek J. McCulloch C.A. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 98: 551-558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated that this procedure removes all loosely bound but not internalized beads. Internalization of beads was confirmed by electron microscopy and confocal microscopy of calcein/AM-loaded cells (2 μm at 37 °C for 30 min). The percentage of phagocytic cells was assessed by flow cytometry as described previously (24Lee W. Sodek J. McCulloch C.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 168: 695-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), and 69.2 ± 3.3% of cells (n = 3) were found to be phagocytic with this procedure. To assess the relative amount of bead internalization per cell, cells with internalized beads were replated onto 60-mm dishes and incubated for 8 h to allow attachment and spreading. Image analysis measurements were made on the mean projected area of cells occupied by internalized beads (509 ± 6.0 μm2/cell with a mean total cell area of ∼1200 μm2; ∼42% coverage). To test the specificity of cadherin-based mechanotransduction, we used magnetic particles that were coated with anti-N-cadherin antibody or anti-CD-90 antibody (control). BioMag magnetic beads covalently linked to goat anti-mouse IgG (Fc specific) antibody were incubated with mouse anti-human primary antibody (anti-N-cadherin antibody or anti-CD-90 antibody at a concentration of five times Fc binding capacity of IgG beads) in phosphate buffer, pH 8.2, for 1 h at 37 °C. These beads were washed three times with PBS, sonicated, and incubated with monolayer of cells for 45 min at 37 °C in α-MEM to allow binding to the cell surface. Unbound beads were washed off by PBS. Force was generated based on electromagnetic attraction of ferric oxide beads as described (25Glogauer M. Ferrier J. McCulloch C.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C1093-C1104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, an electromagnet was made from a core of annealed Mu metal (BCL Magnetics, Burlington, Canada). The core was wound with 1600 turns of 16-gauge Belden wire (Electrosonic, Toronto, Canada). A direct current power supply was used that provided adjustable voltage (0–100 V) and current (0–33 A). A magnet pole extension was made so that a consistent distance from the magnet pole to the cell (∼5 mm) was maintained. A current through the core winding of 20 A produced a flux density of 420 ± 2.5 G with a gradient of 54 G/mm just outside the pole extension. A single 1-s force application was used for all experiments measuring [Ca2+]i, resulting in a strong force stretching the intercellular junctions between S cells and A cells. In experiments using anti-N-cadherin antibody coated beads, force was applied to the cadherin-mediated attachments. In some experiments, a ceramic permanent magnet (Gr. 8, 2.2 × 9.6 × 11 cm; Jobmaster, Mississauga, Canada) was used to generate perpendicular forces (26Glogauer M. Ferrier J. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1998; 435: 320-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) on S cells (with internalized beads) attached to the dorsal surface of A cells. For these experiments the pole face was parallel with and 1 cm from the cell culture dish surface. The force generated by magnetic field application to a S cell with internalized beads was estimated using Stokes' law (27Massey B.S. Mechanics of Fluids. Van Nostrand Co., Princeton, NJ1968: 154-155Google Scholar) and from direct measurements of the velocities of these cells in fluids of known viscosities as described (25Glogauer M. Ferrier J. McCulloch C.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C1093-C1104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To maximize applied force, we only selected cells with high bead loading (>40% of cell volume) and applied a current of 30 A at 60 V to the electromagnet. We reasoned that because S cells are attached to A cells largely through cadherin-mediated adherens junctions (15Ko K. Arora P. Lee W. McCulloch C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C147-C157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the forces applied to the S cells are transferred to these adhesive junctions. Using the above method (25Glogauer M. Ferrier J. McCulloch C.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C1093-C1104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we estimated that the force applied to these intercellular contacts is 155 ± 18 pN/S-A cell couple. Propidium iodide staining was used to determine whether ferric oxide beads and force application cause damage to the cells during the duration of the experiments. Flow cytometry analyses were performed as described (24Lee W. Sodek J. McCulloch C.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 168: 695-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Briefly, following internalization of ferric oxide beads by the cells and force application, the cells were stained with propidium iodide (10 μl/ml; Calbiochem; 5 min at 37 °C), trypsinized, pelleted, and resuspended in PBS to a cell concentration of 1 × 106/ml. The cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. The cells for microinjection were subcultured to 50% confluency in 30-mm glass bottom dishes (Willco Wells, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Needles for microinjection were prepared from glass capillaries (1.5-mm outer diameter; Kwik-fil; World Precision Instruments, Inc., New Haven, CT) and pulled on a micropipette puller (Brown-Flaming; Sutter Instrument Co., San Francisco, CA). For microinjection, the cells were viewed with a Nikon TE-3000 microscope using a 40× objective. Microinjections were performed using an Eppendorf micromanipulator model 5171 and transjector model 5246 (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). Rhodamine-labeled nonmuscle monomeric actin (1–2 mg/ml) for injections was prepared in 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm CaCl2, and 0.2 mm ATP. All solutions for microinjection were centrifuged for 15 min at 14,000 rpm to remove dust and backloaded. Volumes injected were 5–10% of cell volume. For continuous variable data, the means and S.E. were computed, and when appropriate comparisons between two groups were made with unpaired Student's t tests with the statistical significance set at p < 0.05. Analysis of multiple groups was made by ANOVA followed by a post-comparison Scheffe test with the statistical significance set at p< 0.05. We first developed a model to test whether adherens junctions are mechanotransducers by applying controlled mechanical forces through cells with internalized ferric oxide beads (Fig.1 A). Human fibroblasts were incubated with ferric oxide beads overnight for internalization by phagocytosis (22McKeown M. Knowles G. McCulloch C.A. Cell Tissue Res. 1990; 262: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Electron microscopy of these cells showed complete internalization of the ferric oxide beads (Fig. 1 B). Based on transmitted light microscopy, the optimal amount of bead loading via phagocytosis was determined to be 5 mg/35-mm tissue culture well of confluent cells (∼20–30 beads/cell). Notably, higher bead-to-cell ratios did not increase bead loading (Fig. 1 C). We estimated the volume of the cell occupied by beads to be 42.4 ± 5% by confocal microscopy optical sectioning of calcein/AM-loaded cells with internalized beads. This volume was consistent with the estimate obtained by transmitted light microscopy (509 μm2/1200 μm2; ∼42%) described under “Experimental Procedures.” The cells with internalized beads were suspended by trypsinization in the presence of calcium to remove surface-bound beads and were then added onto substrate-attached monolayers of fibroblasts. We have previously shown that S cells and A cells rapidly (<15 min) form intercellular adherens junctions (15Ko K. Arora P. Lee W. McCulloch C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C147-C157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that are cadherin-mediated (17Ko K. Arora P. Bhide V. Chen A. McCulloch C. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1155-1167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When an electromagnetic field of 150.3 ± 8.6 Gauss was applied, the S cells were attracted toward the pole of the magnet and moved but were not detached (Fig. 1 D), because S cells are attached to A cells through adherens junctions (15Ko K. Arora P. Lee W. McCulloch C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C147-C157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanical force applied to the intercellular junctions was estimated by measuring magnet-induced movement of S cells with internalized beads moving through viscous fluids (see “Experimental Procedures”) and was ∼150 pN/cell for cells with high bead-loading. When S cells are attached to A cells, this magnetically generated force is applied to the intercellular junctions between the S-A cell couples (Fig. 1,A and D). Following deformation of the S cell when the magnetic force was applied (Fig. 1 D), we considered that the resultant increase in membrane tension associated with cellular deformation may activate mechanosensitive channels (e.g. Ca2+-permeable channels; Ref. 28Sackin H. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 333-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar; see below). To validate our model of intercellular stretching, we tested whether fibroblasts with internalized ferric oxide beads are viable and exhibit normal metabolism with or without force application. At the optimal bead loading of 5 mg/well, these cells exhibited normal morphology and function as shown by their ability to attach to other cells or to a cell culture substrate. Further, they exhibited similar proportions of proliferating cells as control cultures when analyzed for the percentage of S phase cells by flow cytometry (Fig. 1 E). Force application to cells with internalized beads did not cause any detectable plasma membrane damage because their ability to exclude propidium iodide, a membrane impermeant dye, was the same as that of control cells. The mean propidium iodide fluorescence of the group of cells with internalized beads (1.19 ± 0.04 fluorescence channel number), and the group with internalized beads and 4-h force exposure (1.18 ± 0.01) was not statistically different (p> 0.1) from control cells (1.10 ± 0.03). An alternative viability assay based on a replating and cell attachment method (29Kulkarni G.V. McCulloch C.A. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1169-1179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed no difference in viability between control and bead-loaded cells (92.3 ± 5.4% of control; p > 0.1). Immunoblotting of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and the mitochondrial protein COX-1 showed that bead internalization and/or force application did not change the cellular content of these proteins, suggesting that cellular metabolism was unaltered (Fig.1 F). We investigated whether forces applied to intercellular adherens junctions would activate intracellular calcium signaling. Previous reports on the periodontal fibroblast model used here conclusively demonstrate that intercellular adhesion is dependent on cadherin-mediated adherens junctions (17Ko K. Arora P. Bhide V. Chen A. McCulloch C. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1155-1167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After magnetic force application to bead-loaded cells that were attached to substrate-attached A cells, we observed robust [Ca2+]i increases in A cells but not in S cells (Fig. 2). The time from force application to maximum [Ca2+]i increase varied between 30 and 150 s. We assessed whether movement of beads alone inside the cell would induce a calcium transient by measuring [Ca2+]i in substrate-attached cells with internalized beads during magnetic force application. In these cells, no change of [Ca2+]i was observed (Fig. 2), indicating that [Ca2+]i increases were specific to stretching of intercellular junctions and not due to cytoplasmic disturbance from intracellular bead movement. We found that the [Ca2+]i responses to intercellular stretching decreased as cell-cell contacts matured. Thus, at early stages (15 min) of intercellular attachment, force application visibly displaced (Fig. 1 D) magnetite bead loaded suspended cells and induced robust Ca2+ transients (65 ± 9.4 nm above base line) in substrate-attached cells (Fig.3 A). This response decreased as intercellular junctions continued to develop under repeated stretching over a time course of 90 min (15Ko K. Arora P. Lee W. McCulloch C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C147-C157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) when the applied force of ∼150 pN no longer could induce [Ca2+]itransients (Fig. 3 A). The stretch-induced response appeared to be negatively associated with the intercellular contact area. We measured the area of cadherin and β-catenin staining at the intercellular interface by confocal microscopy and found the that intercellular contact area increased over time (Fig. 3 B). These time-dependent decreases in Ca2+responses after stretch may reflect a reorganization of intercellular contacts. We determined the source of Ca2+ for the observed rise in [Ca2+]i. To establish whether the increase of [Ca2+]i after force application was due to Ca2+ influx or internal mobilization of Ca2+, fura-2-loaded cells were switched to a Ca2+-free buffer containing 2 mm EGTA immediately before force application. Under these conditions, force application failed to induce a defined Ca2+ transient (n = 10; Fig.4), indicating that the robust intracellular Ca2+ response was dependent at least in part on calcium influx through plasma membrane-permeable channels. Because a variety of cells express mechanosensitive ion channels (28Sackin H. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 333-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) that mediate the influx of ions across the plasma membrane in response to stretching, we examined whether mechanosensitive channels play a role in intercellular stretch-induced [Ca2+]iresponses. We performed the stretching experiments in the presence of 1 mm GdCl3, an agent that blocks mechanosensitive channels in oocytes (30Yang X.C. Sachs F. Science. 1989; 243: 1068-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar) and in periodontal fibroblasts (25Glogauer M. Ferrier J. McCulloch C.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C1093-C1104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). None of the cells treated with GdCl3 responded to intercellular stretching (n = 8; Fig. 4), indicating that mechanosensitive channels may play an important role in mediating the stretch response. Activation of mechanosensitive ion channels allows MnCl2 to permeate cells and quench fura-2 (31Kirber M.T. Walsh J.V. Singer J.J. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1988; 412: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In the presence of 1 mm MnCl2 we observed a steep drop in fluorescence after application of magnetic f"
https://openalex.org/W2335005596,"We have shown that ER-negative and invasive human breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231 have constitutively higher mitogen activated protein kinase (ERK1&2/MAPK) when compared to the ER-positive and non-invasive MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. In MCF-7 cells, TGFalpha stimulation induced only transient MAPK activation, leading to a transient increase in cell migration. However, MDA 231 and MDA 468 cells, TGFalpha stimulation induced sustained MAPK activation, which correlated with enhanced cell motility and in vitro invasion. Serum stimulation activates ERK/MAPK activity persistently in both ER-positive and ER-negative breast cancer cells, leading to enhanced and sustained cell migration. Inhibition of MAPK activation by anti-sense MEK expression in MDA-MB-468 cells significantly inhibits cell migration and in vitro invasion. In contrast, MCF-7 cells expressing constitutively activated MEK show a significant increase in MAPK activity and cell migration, but this failed to enhance in vitro invasion. The kinetic profiles of MAPK activation and inhibition show a relationship between the duration and magnitude of MAPK activation and cell migration in both ER-positive and ER-negative human breast cancer cells. These studies show that cell motility is modulated by the magnitude and the duration of MAPK activation; but increased activation of MAPK may not be sufficient to allow in vitro invasion in non-invasive MCF-7 breast cancer cells."

Considering these results, it was important to assess the function and coupling of TRPC3 channels expressed in the DT40 chicken B lymphocyte cell line in which all three InsP3R subtypes have been genetically eliminated. Cells of both the wild-type DT40 chicken B cell line (DT40w/t) and triple InsP3R-knockout cell line (DT40InsP3R-k/o), were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, streptomycin, and glutamine as described previously (23Sugawara H. Kurosaki M. Takata M. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3078-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar,24Ma H.-T. Venkatachalam K. Li H.S. Montell C. Kurosaki T. Patterson R.L. Gill D.L. J. Biol.

DT40 wild-type and InsP3R-knockout cells cultured overnight in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum were scraped from plates and washed in reduced-serum OptiMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) and then resuspended in OptiMEM at a final concentration of 107 cells/ml. 12 μg of each of the plasmids to be transfected (human M5 muscarinic receptor, human TRPC3, and/or EYFP, each within pcDNA3) were added to 0.5-ml transfection cuvettes with an electrode gap of 0.4 cm followed by the addition of 0.5 ml of the cells in OptiMEM (107 cells/ml). After thorough mixing of the cells and DNA, transfection was carried out using the Gene Pulser II Electroporation system (Bio-Rad) at 350 mV, 960 microfarads, and infinite resistance. The cells were then recovered in OptiMEM (no serum added) for 5 h and then resuspended in OptiMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum, applied to coverslips, and allowed to attach for 1.5 h before Ca2+ measurements were undertaken. The overall efficiency of transfection (EYFP-positive cells) was 20–30%. When cells were cotransfected with EYFP-pcDNA3 and either TRPC3-pcDNA3 or M5R-pcDNA3, ∼30–50% of EYFP-positive cells showed TRPC3- or M5R-mediated Ca2+ responses, respectively. When both TRPC3 and M5R were cotransfected, ∼10–20% of EYFP-expressing cells were positive for both responses. Cells grown on coverslips after transfection were placed in Hepes-buffered Krebs medium (107 mm NaCl, 6 mmKCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1 mmCaCl2, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 11.5 mm glucose, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4) and loaded with fura-2/AM (2 μm) for 25 min at 20 °C. Cells were washed, and dye was allowed to de-esterify for a minimum of 15 min at 20 °C. Approximately 95% of the dye was confined to the cytoplasm as determined by the signal remaining after saponin permeabilization (25Short A.D. Klein M.G. Schneider M.F. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25887-25893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells on coverslips were place in “cation-safe” medium free of sulfate and phosphate anions (107 mm NaCl, 7.2 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 11.5 mm glucose, 20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.2), in the absence or presence of 1 mm CaCl2, SrCl2, or BaCl2, as shown in the figures. Ca2+ measurements in single transfected and groups of untransfected cells were made using an InCyt dual wavelength fluorescence imaging system (Intracellular Imaging Inc.). Transfected EYFP served as the transfection marker and was detected at excitation wavelength 485 nm. Untransfected cells (not expressing EYFP) were identified from the same field and served as control cells. After cell identification, fluorescence emission at 505 nm was monitored with excitation at 340 and 380 nm. Intracellular divalent cation measurements (Ca2+, Sr2+, or Ba2+) are shown as 340/380 nm ratios obtained from groups of 10–12 untransfected and single transfected cells. Details of these divalent cation measurements were described previously (24Ma H.-T. Venkatachalam K. Li H.S. Montell C. Kurosaki T. Patterson R.L. Gill D.L. J. Biol.

All measurements shown are representative of a minimum of three, and in most cases, a larger number of independent experiments. Plasmids were from the following sources: hTRPC3 cDNA from C. Montell (Johns Hopkins); EYFP cDNA from CLONETECH; and human M5 musarinic receptor cDNA from L. Birnbaumer (UCLA). OAG, U-73122, and wortmannin, were from Calbiochem. EGTA and carbachol were from Sigma. Thapsigargin was from LC Services (Woburn, MA). Fura-2/AM was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Anti-chicken IgM (supernatant, M-4 clone) was from Southern Biotechnology Associates (Birmingham, AL). The DT40 cell line was kindly supplied by Dr. Tomohiro Kurosaki, Kyoto, Japan. The DT40 chicken B lymphocyte cell line has been a useful tool for generating gene knockouts, including knockouts of the three genes coding for InsP3Rs. The loci of all three InsP3R subtypes normally expressed in DT-40 wild-type cells were disrupted sequentially by the targeted introduction of mutations of the alleles of each InsP3R-subtype by homologous recombination (23Sugawara H. Kurosaki M. Takata M. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3078-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). The resulting triple InsP3R gene-knockout cells (DT40InsP3R-k/o) have no detectable transcripts or translation products from InsP3R genes, are devoid of any functional InsP3R activity, and contain no detectable InsP3-sensitive Ca2+ stores (23Sugawara H.

We recently reported that Ca2+ entry could be stimulated after store emptying in the DT40InsP3R-k/o cells (24Ma H.-T. Venkatachalam K. Li H.S. Montell C. Kurosaki T. Patterson R.L. Gill D.L. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3078-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Before assessing the function of TRP channels in these cells, we sought to determine the selectivity of cation entry activated by store depletion in DT40 cells. Thus, one particular hallmark for SOCs is their extreme cation selectivity, permitting the passage of Ca2+ but not other even closely related alkaline-earth ions such as Sr2+ and Ba2+ (26Ma H.-T. Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Birnbaumer L. Mikoshiba K. Gill D.L. Science. 2000; 287: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 29Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar). Using cation-safe conditions in which anions other than Cl− were eliminated from the external medium (see “Experimental Procedures”), the characteristic selectivity of SOCs was clearly apparent in the DT40 cells. Thus, as shown in Fig.1 A, after emptying stores in the absence of external Ca2+ using the SERCA (sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase) pump blocker, thapsigargin, the addition of Ca2+ resulted in SOC-mediated Ca2+ entry, whereas no entry of Sr2+ or Ba2+ could be observed (Fig.1 A). The entry of divalent cations in response to store emptying in the DT40InsP3R-k/o cells revealed the same ion selectivity (Fig. 1 B). We may therefore conclude that the presence of InsP3Rs is not required for operation of authentic cation-specific store-operated entry channels. The importance of determining this cation selectivity of SOCs in the DT40 cells has yet greater significance in studies here to assess the expression and function of TRPC3 channels in the DT40 cell lines. Many members of the TRPC or “classical” TRP subfamily of channels, including TRPC3 channels, are activated in response to PLC-coupled receptors (1Clapham D.E. Runnels L.W. Strubing C. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar). Whether store emptying has any input into the activation of TRPC channels is controversial, with evidence found both in favor (7Philipp S. Cavalié A. Freichel M. Wissenbach U. Zimmer S. Trost C.

There is considerable evidence that TRPC channels, particularly the TRPC3 channel, are activated as a result of specific interactions with intracellular InsP3Rs (8Kiselyov K.I. Xu X. Mohayeva G.

Chem. 2001; 276: 21303-21310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Thus, the DT40 cells provide an important means for testing this hypothesis. The DT40 cell line retains an αIgM isotype B cell receptor (BCR), which through activation of the Syk and Lyn nonreceptor tyrosine kinases results in tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of PLC-γ (35Takata M. Sabe H. Hata A. Inazu T. Homma Y. Nukada T. Yamamura H. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1341-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Using DT40w/t cells we could not detect any Ca2+ signals in response to a wide selection of G protein-coupled receptor agonists (including serotonin, bradykinin, and purinergic and muscarinic agonists), indicating no Ca2+mobilization in these cells mediated through activation of endogenous GPCRs coupled to PLC-β. The response of DT40w/t cells to BCR activation by the M-4 clone of anti-chicken IgM (anti-IgM) is shown in Fig. 2 A. In the absence of external Ca2+, the cells displayed a series of rapidly generated Ca2+ spikes representing repeated Ca2+ release from and re-uptake into stores. These spikes slowly subsided after ∼5 min, at which time stores remained in a mostly depleted state. No entry of Sr2+ or Ba2+could be detected, but Ca2+ addition resulted in entry through SOCs albeit smaller than that seen with thapsigargin because of incomplete store emptying. In stark contrast, the DT40 InsP3R-k/o cells were entirely devoid of the Ca2+ release response to anti-IgM, and there was no subsequent activation of SOCs (Fig. 2 B). DT40 cells were transiently cotransfected with separate pcDNA3 vectors containing genes coding for the marker EYFP and the human TRPC3 channel. The successful transfection of functional TRPC3 channels in DT40 cells was dependent on transfection conditions, and successful transfection was effected as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Analysis of transfected DT40w/t cells revealed that after the anti-IgM-induced BCR-mediated Ca2+ response subsided, the addition of Ba2+ resulted in a rapid and substantial entry into cells (Fig. 2 C; red trace). This clearly reflects functional expression of TRPC3 channels, which, in distinction from SOCs, have much lower cation selectivity (26Ma H.-T. Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Birnbaumer L. Mikoshiba K. Gill D.L. Science. 2000; 287: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Although Ba2+ responses were observed in only 30–50% of all EYFP-positive DT40 cells, virtually all brightly fluorescent EYFP-positive cells showed Ba2+ responses. The magnitude of the Ba2+response varied between individual cells likely reflecting variation in the degree of TRPC3 expression. Ba2+ responses were never observed in untransfected (EYFP-negative; blue trace, Fig.2 C) cells imaged simultaneously within the same field as transfected cells. Most significantly, the TRPC3 channel was clearly functional when expressed in the DT40InsP3R-k/o cells. As shown in Fig. 2 D, even though there was no Ca2+release response to anti-IgM in the k/o cells, the addition of Ba2+ to the TRPC3-transfected cells resulted in clear Ba2+ entry. Again, no untransfected cells displayed any Ba2+ entry, and from repeated experimentation there was no significant difference in the size or rapidity of activation of TRPC3-mediated responses in DT40w/t as opposed to DT40InsP3R-k/o cells. The only difference was a persistent slight fluctuation in w/t cells because of persistent, albeit reduced, Ca2+ release spikes. Based on the rather substantial information that the DT40InsP3R-k/o cells are devoid of InsP3Rs (23Sugawara H. Kurosaki M. Takata M. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3078-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar,24Ma H.-T. Venkatachalam K. Li H.S. Montell C. Kurosaki T. Patterson R.L. Gill D.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 15945-15952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), we may conclude that the InsP3R does not play an obligatory role in the coupling between BCRs and the activation of TRPC3 channels. Under the conditions we describe here for TRPC3 expression in DT40 cells, the functional coupling of TRPC3 channels was not modified by store emptying. Thus, we show here that TRPC3 channels can be activated by PLC-coupled receptors under conditions in which there is no concomitant store emptying. The question arising is how receptor-induced PLC activation mediates TRPC3 channel activation. That is, how does receptor-mediated PLC activation couple to open TRPC3 channels if neither the action of InsP3 to empty stores nor the physical presence of the InsP3 are required? The most likely possibilities are that coupling is mediated either by the other PLC-derived product, diacylglycerol, or perhaps by a direct physical coupling role of the PLC enzyme itself as was recently suggested by Broad et al.(28Broad L.M. Braun F.J. Lievremont J.P. Bird G.S. Kurosaki T. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15945-15952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) for the activation of SOCs. An action of DAG derivatives on TRP channels has been reported previously (26Ma H.-T. Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Birnbaumer L. Mikoshiba K. Gill D.L. Science. 2000; 287: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 34Hofmann T. Obukhov A.G. Schaefer M. Harteneck C. Gudermann T. Schultz G. Nature. 1999; 397: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar), and we therefore examined their actions on TRPC3 channels in the DT40 cells. The membrane-permeant derivative of DAG, 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (OAG) was a powerful activator of TRPC3 channels transfected in both DT40w/t cells (Fig.3 A) and in the DT40InsP3R-k/o cells (Fig. 3 B). The action of OAG in both cell types was clearly through TRPC3 channels because no untransfected cells in the same imaged fields showed any response to OAG (Fig. 3, A and B, blue traces). The extent of TRPC3 activation with 100 μm OAG varied between cells depending on channel expression but, averaged from many experiments, TRPC3 activity was not significantly different between the two cell lines. We may conclude, therefore, that this action of OAG is also entirely independent of the InsP3R. The question of the dependence of TRP channels on PLC activity was addressed by determining the effects of blocking PLC activity with the PLC inhibitor U-73122 (36Smith R.J. Sam L.M. Justen J.M. Bundy G.L. Bala G.A. Bleasdale J.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1990; 253: 688-697PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 C (blue trace), pretreatment of TRPC3-transfected DT40w/t cells with 20 μm U-73122 completely prevented anti-IgM-induced Ca2+ release. It also completely prevented activation of TRPC3 channels. However, the U-73122 blockade of coupling between receptors and TRPC3 channels was overcome by the subsequent addition of OAG, which stimulated TRPC3 channels the same as untreated cells. The actions of U-73122 on responses in TRPC3-transfected DT40InsP3R-k/o cells were the same (Fig. 3 C, red trace; the difference seen in the extent of OAG activation of TRPC3 channels in the w/t and k/o cells was not consistent and reflects only the degree of TRPC3 expression). These results are consistent with the view that BCR-induced TRPC3 activation is mediated by PLC-induced DAG production and is independent of the InsP3R. This provides another important distinction from the activation process for SOCs. Thus, using DT40-w/t cells, the complete inhibition of PLC using U-73122 did not alter thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ release or the subsequent activation of SOCs (Fig. 3 D). This result is distinct from the U-73122-induced blockade of SOCs reported by Broadet al. (28Broad L.M. Braun F.J. Lievremont J.P. Bird G.S. Kurosaki T. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15945-15952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), which suggested that PLC activation was a requirement for SOC activation in mouse lacrimal cells and Rat Basophilic Leukemia cells. The distinction between the PLC requirement for SOCs and TRPC3 channels described here is particularly compelling because the function of both channels was compared directly within a single cell type. It could be argued that by interacting directly with the PLC enzyme, U-73122 might prevent a “coupling” role of the PLC enzyme as well as blocking the PLC enzymic activity. We therefore investigated the role of depleting the PLC substrate PtdIns 4,5-bisphosphate by using wortmannin, which at 10 μm inhibits PtdIns 4-kinase (28Broad L.M. Braun F.J. Lievremont J.P. Bird G.S. Kurosaki T. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15945-15952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 37Downing G.J. Kim S. Nakanishi S. Catt K.J. Balla T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3587-3594Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The effect of wortmannin pretreatment of TRPC3-transfected DT40w/t cells was to block anti-IgM-mediated store release and TRPC3-mediated Ba2+ entry, but OAG could still induce Ba2+ entry (Fig. 3 E). Thus, the action of wortmannin is the same as U-73122 and would indicate that the role of PLC in stimulating TRPC3 channels is through formation of products, most likely DAG. We also examined the effects of the same wortmannin pretreatment on SOC-mediated Ca2+ entry and found no effect (Fig. 3 F), which appears to contrast with the results of Broad et al. (28Broad L.M. Braun F.J. Lievremont J.P. Bird G.S. Kurosaki T. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15945-15952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), a fact we cannot explain. Certainly, we observe a stark difference between the effects of PLC blockade on TRPC3 activation as opposed to SOC activation. One last significant question remained on receptor-induced coupling to activate TRPC3 channels. Our results so far on TRPC3 activation had been confined to responses through the BCR, which is mediated via nonreceptor tyrosine kinase activation of the PLC-γ enzyme (35Takata M. Sabe H. Hata A. Inazu T. Homma Y. Nukada T. Yamamura H. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1341-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). The important question to answer was whether InsP3Rs play a role in TRPC3 channel activation in response to G protein-coupled receptors, which are coupled to PLC-β activation. Such a determination derives special significance because the reported role of InsP3Rs in TRP activation has been determined from studies on GPCR-induced responses, in particular those mediated by muscarinic receptors (8Kiselyov K.I. Xu X. Mohayeva G. Kuo T. Pessah I.N. Mignery G.A. Zhu X. Birnbaumer L. Muallem S. Nature. 1998; 396: 478-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). As described above, the DT40 cells are curiously devoid of endogenously expressed GPCRs mediating Ca2+ responses through PLC-β. Therefore, we assessed functional coupling in DT40 cells transiently expressing plasmids coding for both the human M5 muscarinic receptor and the human TRPC3 channel (in addition to the EYFP marker plasmid). Initially we determined whether transfection with the M5R alone could couple through endogenous PLC-β activity in DT40 cells to give Ca2+ signals. As shown in Fig.4 A for M5R-transfected DT40w/t cells, application of the muscarinic agonist carbachol induced a substantial release of Ca2+ from stores, whereas no untransfected cells in the same fields showed any response. Indeed, the release of Ca2+ from stores was sufficient to give good activation of SOCs. Thus, the addition of Ca2+ but not Sr2+ or Ba2+ gave rise to a substantial Ca2+-specific entry into M5 receptor-transfected but not untransfected cells (Fig. 4 A). These results clearly reflect the expression of M5 receptors functionally coupled to endogenous PLC-β. As expected, the transfection of M5 receptor into DT40InsP3R-k/o cells resulted in no release or activation of Ca2+ entry (Fig. 4 B). Using DT40w/t cells co-transfected with M5R and TRPC3 channel plasmids, there was a clear and profound activation of Ba2+ entry through the expressed TRPC3 channel. (Fig. 4 C). Most significantly, similar cotransfection in the DT40InsP3R-k/o cells resulted in almost identical profound activation of TRPC3 channels in response to muscarinic receptor stimulation (Fig. 4 D) Overall, our results using DT40 cells provide a rather clear picture of the mode of activation of TRPC3 channels in response to receptor-stimulated PLC-γ or PLC-β enzymes. TRPC3 activation appears independent of InsP3Rs and, at least under the conditions of expression described here, independent of stores. We cannot rule out the possibility that InsP3 produced from PLC could mediate an action on TRPC3 channels, but it would not be through the known InsP3Rs. However, because DAG derivatives can directly activate TRPC3 channels, it is reasonable to assume that DAG is the physiological mediator. Our studies (not shown) reveal that the actions of OAG and receptor-activated PLC on TRPC3 channels are nonadditive, consistent with the view that DAG from PLC activation is sufficient to cause TRPC3 activation. Considering the substantial evidence indicating a direct interaction between TRPC3 channels and InsP3Rs (8Kiselyov K.I. Xu X. Mohayeva G. Kuo T. Pessah I.N. Mignery G.A. Zhu X. Birnbaumer L.

It is also possible that the InsP3R gene deletions in DT40InsP3R-k/o cells were incomplete and that a partial gene product corresponding to an InsP3R fragment could mediate TRPC3 activation; however, our results indicate that full-length InsP3Rs are not required to activate TRPC3 channels. Recent studies implicate ryanodine receptors as possible mediators of TRPC3 channels and SOCs (38Kiselyov K.I. Shin M.D. Wang Y. Pessah I.N. Allen P.D. Muallem S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 421-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), and we should consider it possible that endogenous ryanodine receptors could fulfill a coupling role in the absence of InsP3Rs in DT40 cells. Finally, whereas our results reveal some significant differences between the operation of TRPC3 channels and SOCs, we should also consider that both TRPs and SOCs, as well as InsP3Rs, share the common feature of being modified by 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (24Ma H.-T.

In the case of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), an RVXFXD motif on a targeting subunit binds to a cleft in PP1c, the catalytic subunit. Here we report that a substrate of PP1, the Na-K-Cl cotransporter (NKCC1), bears this motif in its N terminus near sites of regulatory phosphorylation and that direct binding of PP1 to NKCC1 is functionally important in determining the set point for intracellular chloride regulation. NKCC1 mutants in which the motif is destroyed or improved exhibit dramatically shifted activation curves because of a change in the rate of cotransporter dephosphorylation. Furthermore, direct interaction of NKCC1 and PP1c observed by coprecipitation of the two proteins is not seen in a mutant lacking the site. This establishes a new paradigm of phosphatase specificity, one in which a substrate protein containing an RVXFXD motif binds directly to PP1c; we propose that this may be a quite general mechanism.

The specificity of these otherwise promiscuous enzymes is conferred by targeting subunits, each of which binds specifically to the phosphatase and targets it to the vicinity of substrate proteins. For protein phosphatase 1 (PP1),1 a cleft in the catalytic subunit (PP1c) binds proteins that contain the consensus motif, RVXFXD, illustrated both in a direct examination of the molecular structure (3Egloff M.P.

Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28368-28372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The present study began with the observation that the N terminus of the Na-K-Cl cotransporter (NKCC1) contains a highly conserved region with the sequence RVNFVD (residues 140–145 in human NKCC1, 107–112 in shark NKCC1), posing the possibility that the cotransporter is directly targeted as a phosphatase substrate.The Na-K-Cl cotransporter is an integral membrane protein constituting a major regulated pathway for coupled inward movement of Na+, K+, and Cl− in many cell types. The transporter is a central element in electrolyte movement by secretory epithelia, where it functions in concert with cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, potassium channels, and the sodium pump to bring about transcellular chloride transport (5Haas M.

Phosphorylation of NKCC1 is mediated by a kinase whose identity is still unknown, but dephosphorylation appears to occur through the action of protein phosphatase 1 (10Pewitt E.B. Hegde R.S. Haas M. Palfrey H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20747-20756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphoregulatory region, including three identified threonine phosphoacceptors, is in the cytoplasmic N terminus of the NKCC1 (7Lytle C. Forbush B. J. Biol.

Functional characteristics of cotransporter regulation are highly conserved among vertebrates from shark to human (14Isenring P. Jacoby S.C. Payne J.A. Forbush B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11295-11301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), consistent with conservation of the identified phosphoacceptor residues and of the RVXFXD motif, which we examine here.In this study we directly examine the hypothesis that the RVNFVD sequence in the N terminus of NKCC1 forms a functionally important binding site for PP1c. It is found that mutations at this locus dramatically alter the activation curve for Na-K-Cl cotransport, consistent with a 10-fold decrease in the rate of cotransporter dephosphorylation. On the other hand a change that “improves” the putative PP1 binding site exhibits the converse behavior, consistent with a 4-fold increase in the rate of NKCC1 dephosphorylation. In transfected HEK cells the functional consequence of removing the PP1 binding site is that the intracellular chloride concentration is maintained at a level 35% above that with wild type NKCC1, supporting the idea that a major role of the Na-K-Cl cotransporter is the regulation of [Cl]i. Finally, it is demonstrated through coprecipitation experiments that PP1 does indeed bind to the NKCC1 protein. Because the RVXFXD motif is found in a large number of cytosolic and membrane proteins, we propose that this new paradigm of phosphatase targeting may be of very broad importance in cellular regulation.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONShark and human NKCC1 are 74% identical in overall amino acid sequence, and the regions containing the regulatory phosphoacceptors (shark 172–202) and the putative PP1 binding site (shark 107–112) are almost fully conserved between the two species (95 and 100% identity, respectively). In addition the properties of regulation of shark and human NKCC1s by [Cl]i appear virtually identical in transfected HEK cells (14Isenring P. Jacoby S.C. Payne J.A. Forbush B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11295-11301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). 2Unpublished results. We have chosen to study shark NKCC1 because of the availability of superior antibody probes for this species and because of the ability to conduct studies in both the cell culture model and in the intact organ, the salt-secreting rectal gland of the shark.That PP1 is responsible for regulatory dephosphorylation is suggested by previous studies of the relative effects of calyculin A and okadaic acid on Na-K-Cl cotransport (25Palfrey H.C. Pewitt E.B. Pflugers Arch. 1993; 425: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and NKCC1 activation (20Lytle C. Forbush B. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C437-C448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To further examine this relationship, we have followed the dephosphorylation of the Na-K-Cl cotransporter in solubilized cell extracts and compared the effectiveness of a number of inhibitors of PP1 and PP2A (Fig.1). In each case inhibition of NKCC1 dephosphorylation has a K0.5 consistent with the action of PP1, but for most inhibitors the results are well outside the reported range for PP2A. Together these results are very strongly supportive of PP1 as the phosphatase involved in NKCC1 regulation.To study the regulatory importance of the putative PP1 binding site in NKCC1, we prepared mutations of NKCC1 including alanine substitution throughout the RVXFVD motif (RANF, RVNA, AANA) the replacement of the NKCC1 sequence with the homologous sequence from NKCC2, deletion of the N terminus before G153, and replacement of the NKCC1 sequence with the sequence of a known PP1c binding peptide. Activation of the stably transfected NKCC1 mutants was accomplished by preincubation in media with a range of extracellular Cl concentrations, because activity of NKCC1 is controlled via phosphorylation in response to changes in cell volume and [Cl]i (18Gillen C.M. Forbush B. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C328-C336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Lytle C. Forbush B. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C437-C448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The rapidly reversible cotransporter inhibitor furosemide was included during the preincubation period to eliminate any effects of NKCC1 on cellular electrolyte balance. Fig.2 c illustrates the changes in intracellular [Cl] and volume that are brought about by these experimental preincubations. As illustrated in Fig. 2, a andb, the results of these 86Rb influx experiments demonstrated a striking shift in the activation curve of NKCC1 in each of the alanine-substituted mutants and in the N-terminal deletion. The shift is in the direction of higher NKCC activity at all Cl concentrations, consistent with a higher level of phosphorylation. The change is well fit by assuming a 10-fold decrease in the rate of dephosphorylation in a simple phosphorylation-dephosphorylation model (Fig. 2 b, lines).Clearly, destruction of the RVXFXD motif produces an activating shift in cotransporter regulation, consistent with a decrease in the ability of PP1 to dephosphorylate the target protein. Noting that the NKCC sequence might be “improved” relative to other RVXFXD peptides, we tested the sequence KRVRFED of a known PP1c binding peptide (4Zhao S. Lee E.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28368-28372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). This sequence has additional basic residues at −2 and +1 and an additional acidic residue at +3 (numbering relative to valine), each of which is expected to improve the binding. Indeed this mutant proved to be extremely difficult to activate, maximum flux being attained only in the presence of the phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A. This is consistent with an increased rate of dephosphorylation, and the data can be modeled by a 4-fold higher rate compared with control (Fig. 2 b, lower line).The RVXFXD site is 100% conserved in NKCC1 among various vertebrate species from shark to human, but the corresponding region of the renal form, NKCC2, (RISFRP) has RP instead of a favorable downstream acidic residue. Indeed, when the NKCC1 site was replaced with the NKCC2 sequence, we found that this mutant behaved similarly to others in which the RVXFXD site was destroyed; regulation was shifted in favor of activation at all Cl concentrations (Fig. 2). This result must explain, at least in part, the fact that NKCC2 is constitutively more active than NKCC1 both in its native location in the renal tubule (26Hebert S.C. Andreoli T.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246: F745-F756PubMed Google Scholar) and when it is expressed inXenopus oocytes (27Caron L. Rousseau F. Gagnon E. Isenring P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32027-32036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar).An interesting aspect of the RVXFXD mutations is that they do not have all or none functional consequences. We expected that our mutants might be fully active under all conditions, but instead loss of the motif resulted in a cotransporter that is 10-fold more readily activated compared with controls. Thus the interaction appears to have evolved to fine tune the volume and Cliregulatory system, effectively adjusting the set point to a lower cell volume and lower [Cl]i. The physiological consequence of this change is illustrated in Fig. 3, where resting [Cl]i in transfected HEK cells is seen to be strongly determined by the nature of the NKCC1 regulatory domain. The effect on cell volume is smaller (not significant in these experiments) consistent with the idea that NKCC1 plays a larger role in [Cl]i regulation than in volume regulation (18Gillen C.M. Forbush B. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C328-C336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The behavior of our mutants is consistent with changes in regulatory phosphorylation of NKCC. Above we modeled this as a change in the dephosphorylation rate. An alternative possibility is that a change in the phosphorylation rate is most affected by the mutations. To address this question, we examined the decrease in the level of phosphorylation of NKCC1 as a function of time in extracts of transfected HEK cells. As illustrated in Fig. 4, each of the alanine mutations results in a ∼5-fold decrease in the rate of cell-free dephosphorylation compared with that of wild type NKCC1 (we have no explanation for the small rapid phase of dephosphorylation that is similar in each sample). This strongly supports the proposal that impaired interaction with PP1c is the outcome of mutations of the RVXFXD site.To look directly for interaction between PP1c and NKCC1 we utilized a microcystin affinity matrix to pull down PP1c (23Moorhead G. MacKintosh C. Morrice N. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Microcystin binds to PP1 with high affinity at a site distinct from the one that binds the RVXFXD sequence (3Egloff M.P. Johnson D.F. Moorhead G. Cohen P.T. Cohen P. Barford D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1876-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 28Goldberg J. Huang H.B. Kwon Y.G. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1995; 376: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). Fig.5 a illustrates the efficiency of the microcystin beads in precipitating PP1c and demonstrates that pre-incubation with excess microcystin blocks the precipitation. As shown in Fig. 5 b, wild type NKCC1 is specifically coprecipitated with PP1c on the microcystin beads, as detected by NKCC1 antibodies. In an alanine mutant lacking the RVXFXD consensus site, there was no detectable coprecipitation of cotransporter, but in the “improved” KRVRFED mutant, greatly increased coprecipitation of NKCC1 with PP1c was consistently observed. These results demonstrate direct binding of PP1c to NKCC1, and they show that the RVXFXD consensus motif is responsible for the physical interaction.Previous utilization of microcystin affinity methods led to the coprecipitation of numerous proteins with PP1c (29Campos M. Fadden P. Alms G. Qian Z. Haystead T.A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28478-28484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Specific interactions have been noted between PP1 or PP2 and various potential target proteins (30Ayllon V. Martinez A.C. Garcia A. Cayla X. Rebollo A.

Chem. 1998; 273: 24396-24405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), but a functional interaction has been demonstrated only in the case of the Bad protein (30Ayllon V. Martinez A.C. Garcia A. Cayla X. Rebollo A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2237-2246Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that in addition to the targeting proteins identified in earlier studies, many PP1c-associating proteins may actually be substrate proteins specifically recognized through an RVXFXD motif. Similarly it appears likely that among the estimated 10% of data base proteins containing the motif (3Egloff M.P. Johnson D.F. Moorhead G. Cohen P.T. Cohen P. Barford D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1876-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar), many more than previously suspected may have functional interactions with PP1c.The results presented here establish a new paradigm for recognition of substrate proteins by PP1-specific interaction between PP1c and an RVXFXD motif on the final target protein. This contrasts with the conventional model in which interactions between PP1c and substrate proteins are mediated by a set of targeting proteins. To our knowledge, the present result is the first time a phosphatase-specific binding site has been identified on a substrate protein and demonstrated to be of functional significance. It seems likely that this paradigm will be found to be widely applicable to the problem of substrate recognition by protein phosphatases. A small number of protein phosphatases is responsible for dephosphorylation of the majority of cellular phosphoproteins (1Shenolikar S. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 55-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 2Wera S. Hemmings B.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar).

Indeed, when the NKCC1 site was replaced with the NKCC2 sequence, we found that this mutant behaved similarly to others in which the RVXFXD site was destroyed; regulation was shifted in favor of activation at all Cl concentrations (Fig. 2). This result must explain, at least in part, the fact that NKCC2 is constitutively more active than NKCC1 both in its native location in the renal tubule (26Hebert S.C. Andreoli T.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246: F745-F756PubMed Google Scholar) and when it is expressed inXenopus oocytes (27Caron L. Rousseau F. Gagnon E. Isenring P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32027-32036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar).An interesting aspect of the RVXFXD mutations is that they do not have all or none functional consequences. We expected that our mutants might be fully active under all conditions, but instead loss of the motif resulted in a cotransporter that is 10-fold more readily activated compared with controls. Thus the interaction appears to have evolved to fine tune the volume and Cliregulatory system, effectively adjusting the set point to a lower cell volume and lower [Cl]i. The physiological consequence of this change is illustrated in Fig. 3, where resting [Cl]i in transfected HEK cells is seen to be strongly determined by the nature of the NKCC1 regulatory domain. The effect on cell volume is smaller (not significant in these experiments) consistent with the idea that NKCC1 plays a larger role in [Cl]i regulation than in volume regulation (18Gillen C.M. Forbush B. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C328-C336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The behavior of our mutants is consistent with changes in regulatory phosphorylation of NKCC. Above we modeled this as a change in the dephosphorylation rate. An alternative possibility is that a change in the phosphorylation rate is most affected by the mutations. To address this question, we examined the decrease in the level of phosphorylation of NKCC1 as a function of time in extracts of transfected HEK cells. As illustrated in Fig. 4, each of the alanine mutations results in a ∼5-fold decrease in the rate of cell-free dephosphorylation compared with that of wild type NKCC1 (we have no explanation for the small rapid phase of dephosphorylation that is similar in each sample). This strongly supports the proposal that impaired interaction with PP1c is the outcome of mutations of the RVXFXD site.To look directly for interaction between PP1c and NKCC1 we utilized a microcystin affinity matrix to pull down PP1c (23Moorhead G. MacKintosh C. Morrice N. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Microcystin binds to PP1 with high affinity at a site distinct from the one that binds the RVXFXD sequence (3Egloff M.P. Johnson D.F. Moorhead G. Cohen P.T. Cohen P. Barford D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1876-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 28Goldberg J. Huang H.B. Kwon Y.G. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1995; 376: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). Fig.5 a illustrates the efficiency of the microcystin beads in precipitating PP1c and demonstrates that pre-incubation with excess microcystin blocks the precipitation. As shown in Fig. 5 b, wild type NKCC1 is specifically coprecipitated with PP1c on the microcystin beads, as detected by NKCC1 antibodies. In an alanine mutant lacking the RVXFXD consensus site, there was no detectable coprecipitation of cotransporter, but in the “improved” KRVRFED mutant, greatly increased coprecipitation of NKCC1 with PP1c was consistently observed. These results demonstrate direct binding of PP1c to NKCC1, and they show that the RVXFXD consensus motif is responsible for the physical interaction.Previous utilization of microcystin affinity methods led to the coprecipitation of numerous proteins with PP1c (29Campos M.

Specific interactions have been noted between PP1 or PP2 and various potential target proteins (30Ayllon V. Martinez A.C. Garcia A. Cayla X. Rebollo A.

Martinez A.C. Garcia A. Cayla X. Rebollo A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2237-2246Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that in addition to the targeting proteins identified in earlier studies, many PP1c-associating proteins may actually be substrate proteins specifically recognized through an RVXFXD motif. Similarly it appears likely that among the estimated 10% of data base proteins containing the motif (3Egloff M.P. Johnson D.F. Moorhead G. Cohen P.T. Cohen P. Barford D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1876-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar), many more than previously suspected may have functional interactions with PP1c.The results presented here establish a new paradigm for recognition of substrate proteins by PP1-specific interaction between PP1c and an RVXFXD motif on the final target protein. This contrasts with the conventional model in which interactions between PP1c and substrate proteins are mediated by a set of targeting proteins. To our knowledge, the present result is the first time a phosphatase-specific binding site has been identified on a substrate protein and demonstrated to be of functional significance. It seems likely that this paradigm will be found to be widely applicable to the problem of substrate recognition by protein phosphatases. Shark and human NKCC1 are 74% identical in overall amino acid sequence, and the regions containing the regulatory phosphoacceptors (shark 172–202) and the putative PP1 binding site (shark 107–112) are almost fully conserved between the two species (95 and 100% identity, respectively). In addition the properties of regulation of shark and human NKCC1s by [Cl]i appear virtually identical in transfected HEK cells (14Isenring P. Jacoby S.C. Payne J.A. Forbush B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11295-11301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). 2Unpublished results. We have chosen to study shark NKCC1 because of the availability of superior antibody probes for this species and because of the ability to conduct studies in both the cell culture model and in the intact organ, the salt-secreting rectal gland of the shark. That PP1 is responsible for regulatory dephosphorylation is suggested by previous studies of the relative effects of calyculin A and okadaic acid on Na-K-Cl cotransport (25Palfrey H.C. Pewitt E.B. Pflugers Arch. 1993; 425: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and NKCC1 activation (20Lytle C. Forbush B. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C437-C448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To further examine this relationship, we have followed the dephosphorylation of the Na-K-Cl cotransporter in solubilized cell extracts and compared the effectiveness of a number of inhibitors of PP1 and PP2A (Fig.1). In each case inhibition of NKCC1 dephosphorylation has a K0.5 consistent with the action of PP1, but for most inhibitors the results are well outside the reported range for PP2A. Together these results are very strongly supportive of PP1 as the phosphatase involved in NKCC1 regulation. To study the regulatory importance of the putative PP1 binding site in NKCC1, we prepared mutations of NKCC1 including alanine substitution throughout the RVXFVD motif (RANF, RVNA, AANA) the replacement of the NKCC1 sequence with the homologous sequence from NKCC2, deletion of the N terminus before G153, and replacement of the NKCC1 sequence with the sequence of a known PP1c binding peptide. Activation of the stably transfected NKCC1 mutants was accomplished by preincubation in media with a range of extracellular Cl concentrations, because activity of NKCC1 is controlled via phosphorylation in response to changes in cell volume and [Cl]i (18Gillen C.M. Forbush B. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C328-C336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Lytle C. Forbush B. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C437-C448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The rapidly reversible cotransporter inhibitor furosemide was included during the preincubation period to eliminate any effects of NKCC1 on cellular electrolyte balance. Fig.2 c illustrates the changes in intracellular [Cl] and volume that are brought about by these experimental preincubations. As illustrated in Fig. 2, a andb, the results of these 86Rb influx experiments demonstrated a striking shift in the activation curve of NKCC1 in each of the alanine-substituted mutants and in the N-terminal deletion. The shift is in the direction of higher NKCC activity at all Cl concentrations, consistent with a higher level of phosphorylation. The change is well fit by assuming a 10-fold decrease in the rate of dephosphorylation in a simple phosphorylation-dephosphorylation model (Fig. 2 b, lines). Clearly, destruction of the RVXFXD motif produces an activating shift in cotransporter regulation, consistent with a decrease in the ability of PP1 to dephosphorylate the target protein. Noting that the NKCC sequence might be “improved” relative to other RVXFXD peptides, we tested the sequence KRVRFED of a known PP1c binding peptide (4Zhao S. Lee E.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28368-28372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). This sequence has additional basic residues at −2 and +1 and an additional acidic residue at +3 (numbering relative to valine), each of which is expected to improve the binding. Indeed this mutant proved to be extremely difficult to activate, maximum flux being attained only in the presence of the phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A. This is consistent with an increased rate of dephosphorylation, and the data can be modeled by a 4-fold higher rate compared with control (Fig. 2 b, lower line).

https://openalex.org/W2319932870,"Many lines of evidence indicate that connexin genes expressing gap junction (GJ) proteins inhibit tumor cell proliferation. However, the precise molecular mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we show that overexpression of connexin43 (Cx43) suppressed proliferation of human osteosarcoma U2OS cells through inhibition of the cell cycle transition from G1 to S phase. This inhibition was attributed to a significant accumulation of the hypophosphorylated retinoblastoma (Rb) protein, which was causally related to decreases in the kinase activities of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) 2 and 4. Enforced Cx43 expression markedly increased the level of the CDK inhibitor p27. This increase resulted from an increased synthesis and a reduced degradation of the p27 proteins, but not influence of the p27 mRNA. Moreover, we show that the Cx43-modulated GJ function was the main contributor to the elevation in p27 levels, in which cAMP was involved. These data suggest that Cx43 appears to inhibit proliferation of U2OS cells by increasing the levels of p27 proteins via post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms."

Here, by using Drosophila mutants with specific defects in presynaptic function, we found that glutamate receptors clustered normally at neuromuscular junctions of mutants that retained spontaneous transmitter secretion but had lost the ability to release transmitter in response to action potentials. In contrast, receptor clustering was defective in mutants in which both spontaneous and evoked vesicle exocytosis were absent. Thus, spontaneous vesicle exocytosis appears to be tightly linked to the clustering of glutamate receptors during development."

Thus, it appears that residues upstream of amino acid 93 influence PrP-res formation and scrapie pathogenesis in mice, whereas residues immediately downstream (94) appear to be important for susceptibility to scrapie infection.In the present study, a cell-free conversion assay was used to study the biochemical influence of the flexible N-terminal tail of PrP on the formation of protease-resistant PrP. This assay generates de novo PrP-res (19Kocisko D.A. Come J.H. Priola S.A. Chesebro B. Raymond G.J. Lansbury P.T. Caughey B.

The conversion of a series of PrP-sen molecules with progressive deletions within the N-terminal tail was studied in the presence or absence of post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and the addition of the C-terminal glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. Our results show that deletions of residues 34–94 and 95–113 have distinct consequences for conversion of PrP-sen to a protease-resistant form and suggest an underlying role for the flexible N-terminal domain of PrP-sen in scrapie pathogenesis.DISCUSSIONDeletion of residues 34–94 and 34–113 from within the N-terminal tail of PrP-sen influenced the quantity and conformation of PrP-res generated in a cell-free assay. It is unclear how these residues may be influencing PrP conversion. However, the primary amino acid sequence within the 34–94 deletion is composed of five octapeptide repeats that may influence intramolecular and intermolecular interactions between PrP molecules and/or other cellular factors that are required for efficient conversion (39Priola S.A. Chesebro B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11980-11985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 40Jarrett J.T. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Cell. 1993; 73: 1055-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar). Extra copies of the octapeptide repeat are associated with heritable TSE disease in both humans (41Pocchiari M. Mol. Aspects Med. 1994; 15: 195-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and transgenic mice (42Chiesa R. Piccardo P. Ghetti B. Harris D.A.

U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5574-5579Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and have been shown to induce PrP aggregation and alter PrP processing in tissue culture cells (39Priola S.A. Chesebro B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11980-11985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 44Lehmann S. Harris D.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 1633-1637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In the current study, a considerable amount of HaWT PrP was pelleted by centrifugation in the absence of PrP-res, whereas deletion of the octapeptide repeat region in deletion mutant HaΔ94 significantly reduced the amount of this PrP-sen self-aggregation (Fig.4 a). The reduced ability of PrP to form self-aggregates was associated with a parallel decline in conversion efficiency. The role of these residues might be to enhance PrP polymerization, which might be beneficial for conversion to a protease-resistant form (40Jarrett J.T. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Cell. 1993; 73: 1055-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar). Deletion of additional residues 95–113 (HaΔ113) caused a further decrease in PrP polymerization and a concurrent decrease in cell-free conversion. Therefore, residues within the N-terminal tail required for PrP-PrP interactions and efficient conversion include both the octapeptide repeat region and amino acids between residue 95–113. Interestingly, insertions and point mutations within this region (residues 95–113) are known to lead to genetic TSE diseases in humans (41Pocchiari M. Mol. Aspects Med. 1994; 15: 195-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and have been shown to confer biochemical properties reminiscent of PrP-res on the mutated PrP-sen molecule (46Lehmann S. Harris D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5610-5614Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar).In our experiments, deletion of residues 95–113 influenced not only the efficiency of PrP conversion in the cell-free assay but also the nature of the PrP-res produced. There was no apparent shift in molecular weight of the largest bands derived from PK digestion of PrP-res generated from unglycosylated HaΔ94, HaΔ113, and HaΔ120 (Fig. 2 b). Therefore, in the presence of PrP-res, these constructs could adopt a fully protease-resistant conformation, which probably reflects the absence of the primary digestion site at residue 89. However, PK digestion of HaΔ113, HaΔ120, and HaΔ124 also resulted in the formation of lower molecular mass bands between 7 and 14 kDa. These bands are likely to be the result of protease digestion at multiple sites downstream of the primary digestion site, since antibody mapping indicated that they were a result of progressive PK digestion from the N terminus. 2V. Lawson, unpublished observations. In PrP-res derived from HaWT, residues 95–113 might protect these secondary cleavage sites from protease digestion. Alternatively, deletion of these residues may alter the conformation of the final protease-resistant product such that these secondary sites are more readily exposed to protease digestion. The significance of these altered forms of protease-resistant PrP in neurodegeneration and clinical disease remains to be determined. However, their formation in the cell-free conversion assay was template-dependent, since they were not detected in the absence of a PrP-res seed. Furthermore, similarly sized low molecular weight protease-resistant PrP forms have been detected in inherited TSE diseases of humans and in brain homogenates of scrapie-infected rodents (13Hope J. Hunter N. Ciba Found. Symp. 1988; 135: 146-163PubMed Google Scholar, 47Kocisko D.A. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Caughey B.

Petersen R.B. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 157: 613-622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), suggesting that these proteins and/or the PrP-res from which they are generated may play a role in TSE pathogenesis in vivo.The conversion efficiency of unglycosylated PrP-sen was not decreased by deletion of residues within the N-terminal region (Fig.2 c). This was in contrast to the effect of these same deletions in the glycosylated protein (Fig. 1 c). Interestingly, the binding of the N-terminally truncated PrP-sen to PrP-res was also improved in the absence of glycosylation. However, conversion of unglycosylated PrP appeared to result in a larger proportion of the lower molecular weight species in the protease-resistant PrP. Quantification of the percentage conversion excluding these lower molecular weight species gave a similar pattern for conversion of the PrP deletion mutants (Fig. 2 d) as was seen previously for glycosylated PrP (Fig. 1 c). Glycosylation may therefore modulate interactions between PrP-sen and PrP-res and promote conversion to a more protease-resistant conformation. Furthermore, the presence of a longer N-terminal region appears to overcome this glycosylation effect, since HaWT and HaΔ94 were predominantly converted to higher molecular weight protease-resistant forms regardless of glycosylation state. Interactions of the flexible N-terminal tail of PrP-sen with antibodies (51Li R. Liu T. Wong B.S. Pan T. Morillas M. Swietnicki W. O'Rourke K. Gambetti P. Surewicz W.K. Sy M.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 567-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) or other parts of PrP-sen itself (7Zahn R. Liu A. Luhrs T. Riek R. von Schroetter C. Lopez Garcia F. Billeter M. Calzolai L. Wider G. Wuthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar) have been reported to alter the conformation of the glycosylated C-terminal domain of PrP. Therefore, residues 34–113, which affected the conversion of glycosylated PrP-sen, might act by modulating the conformation of the C-terminal domain, thus enabling efficient interactions between PrP-sen and PrP-res.A further post-translational modification of PrP-sen involved expression of the molecule without the signal sequence for the GPI anchor. This modification resulted in a molecule that was mostly unglycosylated, which may have contributed to the improved conversion efficiency of HaΔ113, HaΔ120, and HaΔ124. However, efficient conversion of GPI-negative PrP was still dependent on residues 34–94, which supported our earlier hypothesis that intermolecular interactions between residues in the PrP octapeptide repeat region may be necessary for efficient conversion of PrP-sen. However, for unglycosylated PrP containing a GPI anchor, residues 34–94 were not required for efficient conversion (Fig. 2 c), suggesting that in the absence of glycosylation, the hydrophobic fatty acids of the GPI anchor of PrP-sen might promote the PrP-PrP interactions required for conversion. Thus, in the absence of a GPI anchor, the N-terminal region may be required to mediate interactions between PrP-sen molecules to promote efficient conversion to a protease-resistant form.Residues 34–93 are not required for scrapie susceptibility, since transgenic mice expressing PrP-sen lacking these residues remain susceptible to scrapie infection, albeit with delayed kinetics, reduced levels of detectable PrP-res, and an altered pattern of neurodegeneration (17Flechsig E. Shmerling D. Hegyi I. Raeber A.J. Fischer M. Cozzio A. von Mering C. Aguzzi A. Weissmann C. Neuron. 2000; 27: 399-408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The decrease in PrP-res produced from cell-free conversion of HaΔ94 could correspond with the decreased PrP-res formation and delayed onset of disease observed in these transgenic mice. However, the cause of the altered pattern of neurodegeneration is unknown. Transgenic mice expressing further truncated PrP-sen lacking residues 34–106 are reportedly not susceptible to scrapie infection (18Weissmann C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3-6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). This is in contrast with the current study, in which PrP-sen truncated between residues 34 and 113 could be converted to a protease-resistant form. This discrepancy may reflect a simple difference between sequences of PrP-sen that are essential for conversion of mouse PrP versus the hamster PrP conversion presented here. Certainly, different amino acid residues have been shown to influence species-specific conversion of mouse and hamster PrP (52Priola S.A. Chesebro B. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7754-7758Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 53Priola S.A. Chabry J. Chan K. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, a more attractive explanation is that residues between positions 94 and 106 are required for initial infection with a TSE agent but are not essential for the subsequent formation of PrP-res. We have shown that the protease-resistant products associated with conversion of N-terminally deleted PrP-sen lack a large portion of the N-terminal region. Thus, it may also be that the antibodies used to detect PrP-res in the transgenic mouse model were specific to regions of PrP not present in the lower molecular weight protease-resistant products described here (17Flechsig E. Shmerling D. Hegyi I. Raeber A.J. Fischer M. Cozzio A. von Mering C. Aguzzi A. Weissmann C. Neuron. 2000; 27: 399-408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar).Expression of a foreign PrP species in mouse scrapie-infected neuroblastoma cells can block the generation of mouse PrP-res (32Priola S.A. Caughey B. Race R.E. Chesebro B. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 4873-4878Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present studies, interference with mouse PrP-res formation in Sc+N2a cells was reduced by deletion of residues 34–94 from hamster PrP-sen and completely eliminated by deletion of residues 34–113. There was a strong correlation between the effect of deletion of these regions of the PrP molecule on interference in Sc+N2a cells and conversion in the cell-free assay (Fig. 1). It is therefore possible that residues 34–113 play a similar role in both processes. Previous cell-free conversion studies suggested that interference with PrP-res generation by the expression of a foreign PrP species was primarily caused by inhibition of the acquisition of protease resistance rather than by preventing binding of the homologous PrP (54Horiuchi M. Priola S.A. Chabry J. Caughey B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5836-5841Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Consistent with this conclusion, the ability of the hamster-derived PrP-sen to bind to mouse PrP-res was unaffected by the deletions within the N-terminal tail. This suggests that residues in the flexible N-terminal tail of PrP-sen may prevent the homologous PrP species from acquiring protease resistance by interfering with a step of conversion process subsequent to binding. Interestingly, in the system described here, molecules that have been shown to interfere with PrP-res generation in Sc+N2a cells have contained one or both residues of the 3F4 epitope (32Priola S.A. Caughey B. Race R.E. Chesebro B. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 4873-4878Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 52Priola S.A. Chesebro B. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7754-7758Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and deletion of this epitope in the HaΔ113 mutant ablated the ability of HaPrP to induce interference. The noninterfering PrP-sen molecules may also be less able to interact with other components of the conversion process, such as glycosaminoglycans. Zulianello et al. (55Zulianello L. Kaneko K. Scott M. Erpel S. Han D. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 4351-4360Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) proposed that PrP residues 23–34 may bind to an auxiliary molecule required for conversion. However, as residues 23–34 were present in both interfering and noninterfering deletion mutants described in the present paper, these residues do not appear to account for the interference observed here. Transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE)1 diseases are a family of fatal neurodegenerative disorders, which affect both humans and animals. These diseases are characterized by the accumulation of an abnormal form of prion protein (PrP), which is associated with the pathogenic process and differs from normal PrP in its secondary structure and chemical properties. The susceptibility of PrP to digestion with proteinase K (PK) is generally used to distinguish the normally protease-sensitive PrP (PrP-sen) from the abnormal protease-resistant form (PrP-res) (1Meyer R.K.

The C-terminal globular domain of PrP-sen, residues 125–231, is composed of three α-helices and two β-strands connected by loops and turns (2Riek R. Hornemann S. Wider G. Glockshuber R. Wuthrich K.

In contrast, the N-terminal portion of PrP-sen, residues 23–124, has the properties of a flexible random coil polypeptide (2Riek R. Hornemann S. Wider G. Glockshuber R. Wuthrich K.

Marqusee S. Groth D. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. James T.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5362-5377Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Following conversion of PrP-sen to PrP-res, the β-sheet content of the molecule increases (9Safar J. Roller P.P. Gajdusek D.C. Gibbs Jr., C.J. J. Biol.

Symp. 1988; 135: 146-163PubMed Google Scholar). It is apparent from several in vitro studies that the amyloidogenic region of PrP from residues 113–120 is important for the generation of PrP-res. First, PrP-sen with this region deleted is not converted to a protease-resistant form when expressed in scrapie-infected neuroblastoma cells (14Holscher C. Delius H. Burkle A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1153-1159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, peptides composed of amino acid residues within this region inhibit conversion of PrP-sen to PrP-res in both cell-free conversion reactions (15Chabry J. Caughey B. Chesebro B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13203-13207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 16Chabry J. Priola S.A. Wehrly K. Nishio J. Hope J. Chesebro B. J.

Virol. 1999; 73: 6245-6250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The in vitro relevance of the N-terminal region of PrP-sen is supported in vivo by the altered disease susceptibility of PrP knockout mice expressing a transgene encoding various truncated PrP-sen molecules. In these studies, mice expressing PrP-sen with a deletion of residues 32–93 were susceptible to mouse scrapie, albeit with reduced levels of detectable PrP-res, altered clinical signs, and pathology (17Flechsig E.

In contrast, mice expressing further truncated PrP-sen (residues 32–106) were not susceptible to infection (18Weissmann C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3-6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that residues upstream of amino acid 93 influence PrP-res formation and scrapie pathogenesis in mice, whereas residues immediately downstream (94) appear to be important for susceptibility to scrapie infection. In the present study, a cell-free conversion assay was used to study the biochemical influence of the flexible N-terminal tail of PrP on the formation of protease-resistant PrP. This assay generates de novo PrP-res (19Kocisko D.A. Come J.H. Priola"

The gene product of PHF3 is immunogenic in GBM as tested in an allogenic patient serum screening demonstrating antibodies in 24 of 39 (61.53%) sera, whereas none of the 14 healthy persons had antibodies against PHF3. While previous SEREX studies revealed allogenic antibody responses up to 40%, our results for PHF3 represent the highest reported rate for a specific antibody response. We show that GBM patients with an antibody response against PHF3 show significant better survival than patients without PHF3-specific antibodies. Because the amino acid sequence of PHF3 contains a PHD finger (also termed LAP motif), a TFIIS homology, a proline rich region and nuclear localization signals, it supposedly functions as a transcription factor. A polyclonal antibody generated against PHF3 shows nuclear expression in most investigated formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded tissues.

By phylogenetic analysis, plant polygalacturonases fall into at least three groups, one of which is distinguished from the others by the presence of an additional N-terminal domain. We have used RDPG1, the polygalacturonase involved in pod dehiscence in oilseed rape (Brassica napus), as a model to investigate the function of this domain. We have confirmed that this domain is absent in the mature protein by determination of the N-terminal sequence of mature RDPG1 purified from oilseed rape pod. We have furthermore investigated the accumulation and subcellular localization of the precursor containing the N-terminal domain and of the mature protein throughout the development and maturation of the pod. Using recombinant expression in Pichia pastoris, we have produced the RDPG1 precursor, and we present evidence that the N-terminal domain of plant polygalacturonases is not involved in folding or inactivation of the precursor but may play a role in the intracellular transport of this protein family via a novel regulated secretion pathway.

Pectins are a major component of the cell wall of dicotyledonous plants, where they make up about 30% of the primary wall and most of the middle lamella (1Carpita N.C. Gibeault D.M. Plant J. 1993; 3: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (2768) Google Scholar). Diverse roles have been proposed for pectins, including the regulation of porosity and hydration and mechanical properties of the cell wall, cell expansion, and cell-cell adhesion. All of these functions imply rearrangement or disassembly of the pectin network, and pectin metabolism is thus critical to many developmental processes. The presence of PGs has indeed been detected in all developmental processes requiring cell wall modifications. The role of PGs in the late phases of fruit ripening, in organ abscission, in pod dehiscence, and in pollen maturation is well documented (2Fischer R.L. Bennett A.B. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1991; 42: 675-703Crossref Scopus (627) Google Scholar, 3Hadfield K.A. Bennett A.B. Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 4Jenkins E.S. Paul W.

Plant Physiol. 1982; 33: 133-162Crossref Google Scholar), but PGs have also been associated with wounding, interactions with parasites, rhizobium-legume symbiosis establishment, seed germination, vascular tissue differentiation, and pathogen defense response (9Bergey D.R.

Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 419-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Recently, expression of PGs has also been evidenced at low levels and ubiquitously in vegetative growing tissues, where PGs are thought to be involved in growth and development (13Torki M. Mandaron P. Mache R. Falconet D. Gene. 2000; 242: 427-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). PG genes are highly frequent in plant genomes, and their deduced amino acid sequences are rather divergent. In Arabidopsis thaliana, they represent the largest family of polysaccharide hydrolases with 52 genes distributed on the five chromosomes (14The Arabidopsis Genome InitiativeNature. 2000; 408: 796-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (6882) Google Scholar), and this is likely to be the case in other plant species as well. This abundance indicates a tight differential regulation of the spatial and temporal expression of PGs as is suggested by the sequence diversity found in the untranslated 5′ regions of the PG genes by Northern analysis. The sequence divergence observed in the coding regions may be associated with different properties of each of the PG enzymes such as pH optimum, substrate preference, and mode of hydrolysis, which would affect physiological functions and cell wall breakdown. All known plant PGs are secretory proteins, having a signal peptide. Until recently plant PGs were classified in three clades, A, B, and C, based on amino acid sequence comparison (15Hadfield K.A. Rose J.K.C. Yaver D.S. Berka R.M. Bennett A.B. Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 363-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A). However, this classification is not absolute, and it may not be sufficient any longer, considering the growing number of PG sequences in the data bases. A recent phylogenetic analysis including 43 plant PG sequences (13Torki M. Mandaron P. Mache R. Falconet D. Gene. 2000; 242: 427-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) suggests that plant PGs fall into five classes, three of which corresponding to the previously defined clades A, B, and C. The newly revealed clades D and E include A. thaliana genes only at present and are more closely related to clade B than to clade C. The expression patterns remain to be investigated in clades D and E, whereas clades A, B, and C contain more sequences and are better characterized. Clade C comprises solely PGs that are expressed in pollen and that are thought to be exo-enzymes, because only exo-PG activity has been detected in pollen (7Pressey R. Reger B.J. Plant Sci. 1989; 59: 57-62Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Clades A and B comprise endo-PGs and probably also exo-PGs (12Sitrit Y. Hadfield K.A. Bennett A.B. Bradford K.J. Downie A.B. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 419-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Clade A includes PGs expressed in fruit and abscission zones, and clade B includes PGs expressed in fruit, dehiscence zones, and germinating seeds. Thus, it is not possible to distinguish between clades A and B based on mode of action or tissue specificity. However, one feature that sets clade B, and possibly clade E, apart from the other clades is the presence of an additional 40–50-amino acid-long N-terminal domain immediately following the signal peptide (3Hadfield K.A. Bennett A.B. Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 5Kalaitzis P. Solomos T. Tucker M.L. Plant Physiol. 1997; 113: 1303-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 13Torki M. Mandaron P. Mache R. Falconet D. Gene. 2000; 242: 427-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 15Hadfield K.A. Rose J.K.C. Yaver D.S. Berka R.M. Bennett A.B. Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 363-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Propeptides, which are most often located at the N terminus of the mature protein domain, are a common feature of many protein precursors. However, their function has been extensively studied only in protease and peptide hormone precursors, in which the removal of the propeptide is associated with activation of the enzyme or hormone moiety (16Neurath H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 7: 268-271Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In addition to their role in zymogen activation, propeptides may carry sorting signals for the correct targeting of their cognate proteins to their final subcellular location (17Fabre E. Tharaud C. Gaillardin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15049-15055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, propeptides were found necessary for the correct folding of bacterial and yeast secretory proteases in vivo as well as in vitroin denaturation-renaturation experiments (18Baker D. Shiau A.K. Agard D.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). By analogy, it has commonly been assumed that the predicted propeptide of PGs from clade B is involved in keeping the enzyme inactive until its activity is required or in directing the protein to a specific location within the cell wall, but these hypotheses have never been tested (3Hadfield K.A. Bennett A.B. Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 13Torki M. Mandaron P. Mache R. Falconet D. Gene. 2000; 242: 427-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 19DellaPenna D. Bennet A.B. Plant Physiol. 1988; 86: 1057-1063Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, elucidating the function of this N-terminal domain may help to understand the physiological relevance behind the distinction between clades A and B. The rdpg1 gene, encoding the oilseed rape (Brassica napus) pod dehiscence related PG and belonging to clade B was isolated in our laboratory (6Petersen M. Sander L. Child R. van Onckelen H. Ulvskov P. Borkhardt B. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 31: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) as well as by Jenkins et al. (4Jenkins E.S. Paul W. Coupe S.A. Bell S.J. Davies E.C. Roberts J.A. J. Exp. Bot. 1996; 47: 111-115Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). RDPG1 provides a useful model to study clade B enzymes, including the function of their N-terminal domain or predicted propeptide. We have therefore revisited and confirmed the presence of a cleavable N-terminal domain, which is absent in the mature protein for PGs from clade B using RDPG1 as a model, and we have furthermore investigated the site and time of cleavage of this N-terminal domain from the precursor protein in the plant. Recombinant expression of the RDPG1 precursor in Pichia pastoris provided us with a unique source of the precursor and enabled us to address the function of the N-terminal domain in folding and in activation of RDPG1. Finally, we present data pointing at a function for the N-terminal domain of PGs from clade B in the intracellular transport of its enzyme moiety via a novel and regulated secretion pathway. The elusive and transitory nature of most precursors makes their study difficult, and to our knowledge, this is the first time that the function of the propeptide-like domain of a protein different from a hormone or a protease has been studied. Culture of oilseed rape cultivars Topas and Fido and flower tagging to determine the days after anthesis (DAA) at each harvest were carried out as described by Petersenet al. (6Petersen M. Sander L. Child R. van Onckelen H. Ulvskov P. Borkhardt B. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 31: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Whole plants were sprayed with 2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid (4-CPA) as described by Chauvauxet al. (20Chauvaux N. Child R.D. John K. Ulvskov P. Borkhardt B. Prinsen E. Van Onckelen H.A. J. Exp. Bot. 1997; 48: 1423-1429Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Pure pro-RDPG1 recombinantly expressed in P. pastoris was used as antigen to produce antiserum OA01 to pro-RDPG1. The presumed propeptide of RDPG1 was expressed in E. coli as a fusion protein with His6-dihydrofolate reductase (N-terminally to the presumed propeptide). For this, the nucleotides 156–284 region corresponding to the presumed propeptide of RDPG1 (L24-S66) was amplified by PCR from the full-length cDNA clone RDPG1 encoding pro-RDPG1 (6Petersen M. Sander L. Child R. van Onckelen H. Ulvskov P. Borkhardt B. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 31: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) using primers (5′-GGATCCTTGAGTAGCAACGTAGAT-3′ and 5′-CTCGAG TCATGATTCGGTAGTGGGTCT-3′) designed to introduce a BamHI and a XhoI restriction sites (underlined in the sequences) at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively, and a stop codon (in italics in the sequence). The PCR fragment was then cloned into pQE-40 (Qiagen), and the resulting plasmid was checked by sequencing and transformed into Escherichia coliSG13009[pREP4]. Expression of the recombinant protein was induced with 2 mm isopropyl-β-thiogalactopyranoside. Cell harvest, lysis, and purification of the recombinant protein under denaturing conditions using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose column were performed according to the manufacturer's directions (Qiagen). The purified His6-dihydrofolate reductase-presumed propeptide fusion protein was dialyzed against a 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm KCl, 2 m urea, and glutathione (2 mm GSH and 0.2 mm GSSG). Rabbits were immunized both intramuscularly in the hind leg and subcutaneously in the neck region at 4-week intervals with 70 μg of antigen emulsified with RIBI adjuvant R-730 (RIBI ImmunoChem Research Inc.). Preimmune serum was collected before the first injection, and antisera were collected 12 days after each of four injections. An immunoaffinity column was prepared by coupling 5.5 mg of pro-RDPG1/RDPG1 specific IgG to 1 ml of Affi-Gel Hz Hydrazyde affinity support according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad). Coupling yield was 64%. Pro-RDPG1/RDPG1 specific IgG was purified from antiserum OA01 using a protein A-Sepharose CL-4B column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). DZ also comprising the replum and the septum were separated from the remaining pod wall and seeds of mature pods and frozen into liquid nitrogen. DZ (5 g) were ground in liquid nitrogen, and a protein extract was obtained by further grinding with sand and 20 ml of 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (CompleteTM, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and centrifugation (12,000 × gfor 20 min). The resulting salt-free supernatant contained the readily soluble protein. The pellet was resuspended in 20 ml of water and centrifuged as described above. The supernatant was discarded and the pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of 1 mm MOPS, 1m LiCl, pH 7.0, and stirred for 30 min on ice. The sample was centrifuged as described above. The resulting pellet was discarded, whereas the resulting LiCl supernatant represented proteins that are strongly bound to the cell wall through ionic interactions. For immunopurification of RDPG1, the salt-free supernatant or the 2-fold diluted LiCl supernatant was mixed with 1 ml of immunoaffinity matrix and incubated overnight at 4 °C, under rotation, for binding of RDPG1 to the antibody. The gel was then poured into a disposable column and allowed to settle. Washing was carried out with 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. After a pre-elution wash with 10 ml of 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, RDPG1 was eluted with 100 mm glycine, pH 2.0, and collected in 1-ml fractions into tubes containing 50 μl of 1 m sodium phosphate, pH 8.0. The nucleotides 156–1388 and 285–1388 regions of the cDNA clone RDPG1 (6Petersen M. Sander L. Child R. van Onckelen H. Ulvskov P. Borkhardt B. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 31: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), corresponding to the presumed proenzyme (L24-P433) and mature (S67-P433) forms of RDPG1, respectively, were amplified by PCR using the forward primers 5′-AAAGAATTCCTTTGAGTAGCAACGTAGAT-3′ and 5′-AACTGCAGCATCAACTGTTAGTGTTTC-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-GCTCTAGA TCATTAAGGGCATTTAGG-3′. These primers had been designed to introduce an EcoRI or PstI restriction site at the 5′-end of the PCR product and a XbaI site at its 3′-end (underlined in the sequences), as well as two stop codons at the 3′-end (in italics in the sequence). TheEcoRI/XbaI- orPstI/XbaI-digested PCR product, corresponding to nucleotides 156–1388 or 285–1388 regions, respectively, was cloned into the P. pastoris expression vector pPICZαB (Invitrogen). The RDPG1 cDNA fragments were inserted in frame at the 3′-end of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae α-factor secretion signal to ensure secretion of the recombinant proteins and a stop codon had been included before the myc epitope His6 tag. The resulting recombinant plasmids proRDPG1pPICZαB and Δpro-RDPG1pPICZαB were transformed intoE. coli XL1-Blue, checked by sequencing, linearized withSacI, and subsequently transformed in the P. pastoris X-33 strain by electroporation according to the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Transformants were selected on plates with YPDS medium and Zeocin (100 μg/ml). For each construct, approximately 50 transformants were screened for high secretion of the recombinant protein in 10-ml cultures under expression inducing conditions for up to 96 h. Aliquots of the culture medium (150 μl) were taken out every 24 h and analyzed by immuno-dot-blot. The transformants with the highest level of secreted recombinant protein (pro45 and A11 for pro-RDPG1 and Δpro-RDPG1, respectively) were chosen for large-scale expression. For large scale expression of pro-RDPG1 and Δpro-RDPG1, the P. pastoris transformant A11 or pro45 was cultivated in BMGY/BMMY according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). After 72 h of culture in BMMY, cells were harvested by centrifugation (3000 g for 10 min) and discarded. The supernatant (2 liters) was filtered through Whatman folded filters and a protease inhibitor mixture (CompleteTM, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added. All of the following steps were performed at 4 °C. The supernatant was ultrafiltrated to a final volume of 100 ml using a Minitan unit equipped with a high flux Biomax polysulfone membrane with a cut-off of 10 kDa (both from Millipore). The resulting crude extract was applied to a SP-Sepharose Fast Flow XK50/100 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, containing 0.2m NaCl. After a washing step using the same buffer, pro-RDPG1 or RDPG1 was eluted with 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, containing 0.45 m NaCl. The fractions containing enzyme activity were pooled; dialyzed twice for 2 h each against 25 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, containing 50 mm NaCl; and applied to a Mono-Q HR5/5 and a Mono-S HR5/5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) connected in this order and equilibrated with 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, containing 70 mm NaCl. The enzyme passed through the Mono-Q column and bound to the Mono-S column, from which it was subsequently eluted using a 70–1000 mm NaCl gradient in 20 ml or a 70–500 mm NaCl in 60 ml for RDPG1 and pro-RDPG1, respectively. For pro-RDPG1, the Mono-Q column was omitted. The pure enzymes were then stored in 10% glycerol at –18 °C. The concentration of solutions of pure pro-RDPG1 and Δpro-RDPG1 was estimated spectrophotometrically using extinction coefficients (E1%) of 0.793 and 0.851, respectively (21Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4967) Google Scholar). Endopolygalacturonase activity was routinely assayed viscosimetrically in an Ostwald microviscosimeter (Schott-Geräte) at 35 °C in 2 ml. The reaction was initiated by the addition of enzyme in 1 ml of sodium acetate 200 mm, pH 5.0, to 1 ml of a 1% pectin solution (citrus pectin, 31% ME, Hercules) in the same buffer also containing 10 mm EDTA and 0.01% sodium azide. Viscosity was measured at time intervals, and 1 activity unit was defined as in Ref. 22Truelsen T.A. Wyndaele R. J. Plant Physiol. 1991; 139: 129-134Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar. Denaturation-renaturation was achieved in two different ways. 8 m guanidium chloride, 50 mmsodium acetate, pH 5.0, was added to 100 μl of pro-RDPG1 (90 μg) or 50 μl of Δpro-RDPG1 (160 μg) to a final guanidinium chloride concentration of 6.5 m. After incubation for 30 min at room temperature, the samples were renatured by buffer exchange on a Nap-5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 50 mmsodium acetate, pH 5.0. Guanidinium chloride was omitted in control samples. Alternatively, 20 μl of pro-RDPG1 and Δpro-RDPG1 (20 and 65 μg, respectively) were freeze-dried and resolubilized in the same volume of 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0 (control), or the same buffer containing 6.5 m guanidinium chloride, or the same buffer containing 6.5 m guanidinium chloride and 10 mm DTT. After incubation for 1 h at room temperature the samples were renatured by a rapid 60-fold dilution with 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0. In all cases, the samples were then placed on ice, and endopolygalacturonase activity was measured at various time intervals. Emission fluorescence spectra were recorded on a thermostated PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50B luminescence spectrometer using an excitation wavelength of 275 nm. Pro-RDPG1 and Δpro-RDPG1 (50 and 68 μg, respectively, in a total injection volume of 0.2 ml) were applied together or separately to a Superose 12 HR 10/30 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that had been equilibrated with 20 mm ammonium formate, 100 mm NaCl, pH 5.0, at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. Calibration of the column was performed with ferritin (440 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), horseradish peroxidase (44 kDa), and ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa). Their elution volumes were 10.8, 12.8, 13.7, and 16.4 ml, respectively. Following SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (ProBlott, Applied Biosystems) by semidry Western blotting using the EBU-4000 system (CBS) and N-terminal sequences were determined on a Applied Biosystems 477A pulsed liquid sequencer. For immunoreaction, incubation with the primary antibody (overnight at 4 °C), diluted 1:2000 to 1:10000, and subsequently with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated swine anti-rabbit secondary antibody (3 h at room temperature, Dako), diluted 1:2000, was carried out in Tris-buffered saline/5% horse serum/2% Tween 20. Slices of the pod wall tissue, 1 mm thick, which contained the dehiscence zone were fixed and embedded as in Ref. 6Petersen M. Sander L. Child R. van Onckelen H. Ulvskov P. Borkhardt B. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 31: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar. Nonspecific binding sites in the sections were saturated with 6% bovine serum albumin/0.1% fish gelatin/5% normal goat serum/0.05% glycine in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.6, for 30 min. The sections were then incubated with the RDPG1 antiserum (1:1000) or the anti-pectin antibody JIM 5 (23Knox J.P. Linstead P.J. King J. Cooper C. Roberts K. Planta. 1990; 181: 512-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar) (1:100) in phosphate-buffered saline/1% bovine serum albumin overnight at 4 °C. Following rinsing the sections were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with the secondary antibody (10 nm of gold-gold anti-rabbit, 1:10, British Biocel International). The sections were washed, dried onto Formvar film (Agar Aid Bishop's), and counterstained with lead citrate and examined using a transmission electron microscope (model H-7000, Hitachi) at an accelerating voltage of 75,000 V. Determination of the distribution of labeling, as consolidated in TableI, relied on examination of four sections from each of three pods for each treatment. Native RDPG1 was purified to homogeneity from mature pod dehiscence zones (approximately 50 DAA) using immunoaffinity chromatography on an RDPG1-antiserum column in order to determine its precise N terminus and thereby verify the existence of a cleavable, propeptide-like, N-terminal domain. Purification of RDPG1 to homogeneity, as assessed by SDS-PAGE, could thus be achieved in a single step. From 5 g of oilseed rape DZ (fresh weight), 0.25 mg of pure RDPG1 was obtained. SDS-PAGE revealed the presence of two bands in the immunopurified RDPG1: a major band of 49 kDa and a minor band of 54 kDa. Western blots probed with an antiserum raised against the N-terminal domain or against the whole RDPG1 showed that the major band corresponded to mature RDPG1, whereas the minor band contained pro-RDPG1 (Fig. 2 A). N-terminal sequencing of the protein in the major band identified Glu-65 as the exact N terminus of the mature RDPG1. This confirms that RDPG1 is synthesized as a precursor containing a cleavable, propeptide-like N-terminal domain and furthermore reveals the precise length of this N-terminal domain and the exact N terminus of the mature RDPG1. Thus the RDPG1 precursor is composed of a predicted 23-amino acid-long signal peptide (Met-1–Ala-23) (24Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4892) Google Scholar), a 41-amino acid-long cleavable N-terminal domain (Leu-24–Thr-64), and a 367-amino acid-long catalytic domain starting at Glu-65. Furthermore, N-terminal sequencing of the purified protein revealed microheterogeneity with three minor forms starting at Ser-58, Asp-60, and Ser-66, respectively (Fig.1 B). In order to investigate whether the N-terminal domain of RDPG1 is necessary for the correct folding of its cognate protein in vivo, we compared the expression of pro-RDPG1 and Δpro-RDPG1 (the N-terminal domain truncated form of pro-RDPG1, corresponding to the mature RDPG1) recombinantly in P. pastoris. For this, a truncated cDNA lacking the signal peptide coding sequence (bases 1–155) or lacking the signal peptide and the N-terminal domain coding sequence (bases 1–284) was cloned into the P. pastoris vector pPICZα in frame with a DNA sequence encoding a yeast signal peptide to direct the recombinant protein to the endoplasmic reticulum and through the secretory pathway. P. pastoris was transformed with the resulting plasmids (Fig. 1, C and D). Both constructs were able to direct secretion of comparable levels of pro-RDPG1 and Δpro-RDPG1, respectively, into the culture medium, indicating that cleavable N-terminal domain is not required for correct folding of RDPG1 in P. pastoris, as unfolded proteins are not allowed to be secreted but are degraded inside the cell. However,P. pastoris could not posttranslationally process the precursor protein into the mature endopolygalacturonase, as shown by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2 B) and by N-terminal sequencing (Fig. 1 C). This indicates that the protease(s) responsible for this maturation process in the plant is absent in P. pastoris. The normally transitory nature of precursors is a great obstacle to their isolation and study and the inability of P. pastoris to process pro-RDPG1 into RDPG1 provided us with a unique source of the pro-RDPG1 precursor for further investigations of the function of its cleavable N-terminal domain. In order to compare their specific activities, recombinant pro-RDPG1 and Δpro-RDPG1 were purified from the P. pastoris culture broth before their activity was measured. The purification to homogeneity of pro-RDPG1 and Δpro-RDPG1 was achieved with ultrafiltration followed by two ion exchange chromatography steps (Table II). For Δpro-RDPG1, the last step was a combined anion and cation exchange chromatographic separation, in which the enzyme passed through the anion exchanger and bound to the cation exchanger. From 2 liters of culture broth, 8–10 mg of 500–600-fold purified pro-RDPG1 and 3–4 mg of 600–800-fold purified Δpro-RDPG1 were obtained. In the last separation step Δpro-RDPG1 eluted in a single peak, corresponding to a single band in SDS-PAGE. In contrast, pro-RDPG1 eluted in four peaks. SDS-PAGE revealed that each peak contained a single protein, but of varying molecular masses, and immunoblotting confirmed that all four proteins originated from pro-RDPG1, because they were all recognized by an antiserum to RDPG1. N-terminal sequencing of each isoform showed that this heterogeneity was due to random, partial proteolysis within the cleavable N-terminal domain part of pro-RDPG1, resulting in isoforms starting at Ser-26 (full-length pro-RDPG1 and most abundant form), Asp-42, Lys-57, and Ser-58, respectively (Fig. 1 C). Full-length pro-RDPG1 was used for all further analyses. Specific activities of pure pro-RDPG1 and Δpro-RDPG1, determined using various pectic substrates, were very similar, showing that the precursor is fully active. Moreover, the specific activities of pro-RD"

Three different isoforms of RyR have been identified, termed types 1, 2, and 3 (also known as skeletal muscle type RyR, cardiac muscle type RyR, and brain type RyR (reviewed in Ref. 1Sutko J.L. Airey J.A. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1027-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar)). There is indeed abundant expression of these particular isoforms in the respective tissues, but there is also increasing evidence for low expression of different RyR in other tissues (2Giannini G. Conti A. Mammarella S. Scrobogna M. Sorrentino V. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 893-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar).In skeletal and cardiac muscle, RyR are the major intracellular Ca2+ release channels, which control contractility by Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (reviewed in Ref. 3Marks A.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: H597-H605Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In neuronal cells, Ca2+ release via RyR is involved in fundamental brain function, such as long term depression (4Reyes-Harde M.

Nature. 1970; 228: 34-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). In addition, investigations in different cell systems suggest that the cyclic nucleotide cADPR may also function as an endogenous ligand for RyR-mediated Ca2+-release (reviewed in Refs. 6Lee H.C. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 1133-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar and 7Guse A.H. Cell. Signal. 1999; 5: 309-316Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar).Activation of T lymphocytes is a fundamental part of the immune system to ensure protection against foreign antigens. One of the intracellular signaling pathways essentially necessary for T cell activation is a sustained elevation of [Ca2+]i(reviewed in Ref. 8Guse A.H. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 18: 419-448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sustained elevation of [Ca2+]i results in activation of many proteins (reviewed in Ref. 9Premack B.A. Gardner P. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C1119-C1140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Of particular interest is the protein phosphatase calcineurin, which, upon activation by Ca2+/calmodulin, dephosphorylates the transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T cells (10Timmerman L.A. Clipstone N.A. Ho S.N. Northrop J.P. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1996; 383: 837-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Only this dephosphorylated form of nuclear factor of activated T cells can enter the nucleus to activate multiple gene expression, e.g. expression of interleukin-2 (10Timmerman L.A. Clipstone N.A. Ho S.N. Northrop J.P. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1996; 383: 837-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar).Among the first biochemical events that are observed during T cell activation is phosphorylation of multiple proteins on tyrosine residues. These phosphorylation events are mediated by a concerted action of several protein-tyrosine kinases (PTK), including Src family PTKs p56lck and p59fyn(11Appleby M.W. Gross J.A. Cooke M.P. Levin S.D.

Cell. 1992; 70: 585-593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar).Recently, we have provided evidence that cADPR and RyR play an important role in the sustained phase of Ca2+ signaling in T cells (15Guse A.H. da Silva C.P. Berg I. Weber K. Heyer P. Hohenegger M. Ashamu G.A. Skapenko A.L. Schulze-Koops H. Potter B.V.L. Mayr G.W. Nature. 1999; 398: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Since TCR/CD3 complex-mediated Tyr phosphorylation of the type 1 Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor has been described recently (16Jayaraman T. Ondrias K. Ondriasova E. Marks A.R. Science. 1996; 272: 1492-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), in this study we investigated (i) whether also RyR might be phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in a stimulation-dependent fashion, and (ii) whether such tyrosine phosphorylation might have a functional effect on Ca2+ release via RyR.RESULTSJurkat T lymphocytes express the RyR as shown by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting (Fig.1 A), and confocal microscopy (Fig. 1 B). The amount of RyR detected by an anti-RyRcommon mAb did not change significantly within the first minutes upon stimulation of the TCR/CD3 complex (Fig.1 A). When 10,000 × g membranes were prepared in the presence of the Tyr phosphatase inhibitor dephostatin (100 μm), a transient phosphorylation of Tyr residues of the RyR in response to stimulation of the TCR/CD3 complex was observed (Fig. 1 A).Using anti-RyRcommon mAb and a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-mouse antiserum as secondary antibody in confocal microscopy, the main localization of the RyR was found to be close to the plasma membrane in permeabilized Jurkat cells (Fig.1 B). In intact cells, no staining was observed (data not shown). Similar results were obtained using 4,4-difluoro-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene-ryanodine (Molecular Probes) for staining (data not shown). These results indicate that RyR are localized within membrane systems close to the inner surface of the plasma membrane.Phosphorylation of Tyr residues of the RyR was transient, showing marked phosphorylation at 2 min (Fig. 1 A). A more detailed analysis of the time course revealed very weak phosphorylation by 15 and 30 s, whereas substantial phosphorylation was observed at 1 and 2 min (Fig. 1 C). At later time points, e.g. 5 min (Fig. 1 A) or 10 or 20 min (data not shown), no phosphorylation on Tyr residues could be detected. These results were obtained with two different anti-phospho-Tyr antibodies, the mAb PY99 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and a polyclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antiserum (rabbit polyclonal IgG; Upstate Biotechnology).Membrane distribution of RyR, taken together with an extremely rapid kinetics of its tyrosine phosphorylation following TCR/CD3 ligation, implicated p59fyn and p56lck in this event. These PTKs are localized to the membrane due to their N-terminal myristoylation (22Marchildon G.A. Casnellie J.E. Walsh K.A. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Therefore, p59fyn and p56lck are candidates to be involved in Tyr phosphorylation of the RyR.To identify PTK(s) phosphorylating RyR in Jurkat T cells, co-immunoprecipitation experiments using anti-RyR antiserum were carried out (Fig. 2). In addition to tyrosine phosphorylation of the RyR (Fig. 2, left panel, 2-min time point), marked Tyr phosphorylation of a band (or a double band) near 55–60 kDa was detected in RyR immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2, left panel). The time course of phosphorylation of this band/double band was more rapid as compared with Tyr phosphorylation of the RyR itself (Fig. 2,left panel), thus being consistent with the idea that this band represents the PTK(s) associated with and phosphorylating RyR. Analysis of RyR immunoprecipitates for individual PTKs demonstrated that p59fyn and p56lck were associated with RyR in Jurkat T cells. Interestingly, p59fyn was not found in RyR immunoprecipitate from unstimulated cells, but was co-precipitated in a time- and stimulation-dependent fashion (Fig. 2,middle panel). The same experiment carried out for p56lck showed co-immunoprecipitation at all time points, regardless of whether the cells had been stimulated or not (Fig. 2, right panel).Figure 2Tyrosine phosphorylation of p56 lck and p59 fyn co-immunoprecipitated with the RyR. Jurkat T cells were stimulated as indicated by OKT3 (10 μg/ml). Homogenization, preparation, and solubilization of P10 membranes and immunoprecipitation using anti-RyRcommonpolyclonal antiserum were carried out as described in Fig. 1. Protein was separated by SDS-PAGE (7.5% separation gel, 3% stacking gel). The mass of protein in individual lanes corresponds to the mass of RyR immunoprecipitated by 1 μg of anti-RyRcommon polyclonal antiserum. Subsequent tank blotting and immunostaining were carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Antibodies used for immunostaining: left panel, anti-phosphotyrosine mAb PY 99, middle panel, anti-p59fyn mAb; right panel, anti-p56lck mAb (all from Santa Cruz). Since the signal with anti-p56lckwas more intense as compared with mAb PY 99 or anti-p59fyn, the exposure time of the anti-p56lck blot (right panel) was shortened. This shorter exposure time explains the lack of (artificial) “staining” of the lower edge of the blot.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The PTKs implicated in RyR tyrosine phosphorylation, p56lck and p59fyn, were then expressed as GST fusion proteins and tested for the ability to phosphorylate RyR in vitro. GST-p59fyn and GST-p56lckboth stimulated marked phosphorylation on tyrosine residues of RyR (Fig. 3). In these experiments P10 membranes were incubated with the GST kinases in the presence of ATP. Interestingly, the phosphorylation was not transient, as observedin vivo (Fig. 1), but was stable for at least 20 min. This indicates loss or inhibition of phosphotyrosine-protein phosphatase(s) in the P10 preparation on the one hand (kinase assay), or loss of direct contact of PTKs and RyR during spatial redistribution in vivo.Figure 3In vitro phosphorylation of the RyR by GST-p59 fyn and GST-p56 lck.

Recombinant GST-p59fyn and GST- p56lck (each 1 μg) were incubated with P10 membranes (5 mg of protein) in the presence of 1 mm ATP for the times indicated. Incubations were stopped by freezing samples of 1 mg of protein in liquid nitrogen. Then, the membranes were solubilized, RyR was immunoprecipitated, and the immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE (3% stacking gel, 6% separation gel; 5 μg of protein/lane).

Using permeabilized Jurkat T cells, a well established model to analyze Ca2+ release by Ins(1,4,5)P3 and cADPR (18Guse A.H. Roth E. Emmrich F. Biochem.

Immunol. 1995; 155: 3353-3359PubMed Google Scholar), addition of GST-p59fyn, additional GST fusion proteins, or GST alone prior to addition of cADPR did not have significant effects on the amplitude of cADPR-mediated Ca2+-release (Fig. 4,left panel). In addition, the sensitivity of the permeabilized T cells to different concentrations of cADPR (0.1 to 10 μm) remained essentially unchanged with prior addition of GST-p59fyn (data not shown); in other words, there was no shift in the concentration-response curve for cADPR. Next, we added GST-p59fyn a few minutes later than cADPR, a time point where the response to cADPR was still highly active (Fig. 4, middle panel). Under these conditions, GST-p59fyn concentration-dependently evoked additional Ca2+ release. Importantly, GST-p56lck, GST-Grb2, or GST alone used as controls only very slightly increased cADPR-mediated Ca2+release under these conditions (Fig. 4, right panel). The effect of GST-p59fyn was due to its catalytic activity because addition of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor PP2 1 min before addition of GST-p59fyn concentration-dependently blocked the enhancing effect of GST-p59fynwithout disturbing the effect of cADPR itself (TableI). Interestingly, cADPR could be substituted completely by 4-chloro-3-ethylphenol (4-CEP, Ref. 30Islam M.S. Leibiger I. Leibiger B. Rossi D. Sorrentino V. Ekström T.J. Westerblad H. Andrade F.H.

Ca2+ release activated by 4-CEP and Ca2+ was significantly enhanced by GST-p59fyn (TableII), indicating that the conformational change induced by RyR channel opening might be sufficient to make regulatory tyrosine residues accessible to GST-p59fyn.Figure 4GST-p59 fyn enhanced cADPR-mediated Ca2+ release in permeabilized Jurkat T cells.

Open table in a new tab DISCUSSIONIn the present study we have shown that (i) the RyR of T cells is localized in intracellular membrane systems close to the plasma membrane, (ii) the RyR was transiently phosphorylated on Tyr residues upon stimulation of the TCR/CD3 complex, (iii) p59fyn and p56lck were detected in co-immunoprecipitates of the RyR, (iv) recombinant GST fusion proteins of p59fyn and p56lck both phosphorylated immunoprecipitated RyR on tyrosine residues in vitro, and (v) GST-p59fyn, but not GST-p56lck, GST-Grb2, or GST alone, enhanced Ca2+ release by cADPR.Although phosphorylation on tyrosine residues has not yet been demonstrated for RyR, there are several reports on phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues. The type 1 RyR was phosphorylatedin vitro by protein kinase A and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, resulting in functional recovery of the channel, which was inhibited by 2.6 mm Mg2+ (31Hain J. Nath S. Mayrleitner M. Fleischer S. Schindler H. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 1823-1833Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Similarly, Ser/Thr phosphorylation also enhanced the sensitivity of the type 1 RyR toward Ca2+ and ATP (32Herrmann-Frank A. Varsanyi M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 332: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The type 2 RyR was phosphorylated by exogenously added protein kinase A, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, and cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase. However, the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase was much more effective than the other kinases; additionally, endogenous Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase appears to associate firmly with the type 2 RyR (33Hohenegger M. Suko J. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Type 2 RyR phosphorylation by protein kinase A dissociated FK506-binding protein 12.6 from the channel complex, leading to enhanced channel opening; importantly, it has been shown in failing hearts that the type 2 RyR is hyperphosphorylated by protein kinase A, leading to markedly increased channel opening (34Marx S.O Reiken S. Hisamatsu Y. Jayaraman T. Burkhoff D. Rosemblit N. Marks A.R. Cell. 2000; 101: 365-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1659) Google Scholar). Pancreatic β-cells also express the type 2 RyR; in those cells activation of protein kinase A enhanced activation of RyR by caffeine, 4-chloro-3-ethylphenol, or 3,9-dimethylxanthine (30Islam M.S. Leibiger I. Leibiger B. Rossi D. Sorrentino V. Ekström T.J. Westerblad H. Andrade F.H. Berggren P.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6145-6150Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Importantly, [3H]ryanodine binding was also found to be stimulated by phosphorylation of the brain type (type 3) RyR (35McPherson P.S. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19785-19790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Analysis of the type 3 RyR amino acid sequence reveals that multiple tyrosine residues, such as tyrosines 810, 1022, 2289, 4045, and 4684, could well be targeted by Src family PTKs, based on the substrate specificity of these kinases (36Zhou S. Carraway K.L.r. Eck M.J. Harrison S.C. Feldman R.A. Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. Smith D.P. Eng C. Lorenzo M.J. Ponder B.A.J. Mayer B.J. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 536-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). Among the potential substrate sites, tyrosines 4045 and 4684 are also good candidates for binding to Src homology 2 domains of Src family PTKs, based on the specificity of phosphotyrosine sequences recognized by various Src homology 2 domains (37Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2372) Google Scholar).The observed p56lck/p59fyn-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of RyR is consistent with the notion of the central role of these PTKs in early events of T cell signaling. p59fyn and p56lck are thought to trigger the signal transduction pathways initiated by TCR/CD3 ligation by phosphorylating cytoplasmic domains of the TCR/CD3 complex and activating other PTKs involved in these events (38van Leeuwen J.E. Samelson L.E. Curr. Opinion Immunol. 1999; 11: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 39Chan A.C. Shaw A.S. Curr. Opinion Immunol. 1996; 8: 394-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). These PTKs, in turn, phosphorylate phospholipase C-γ and linker for activation of T cells, thus triggering one pathway of Ca2+mobilization in T cells (38van Leeuwen J.E. Samelson L.E. Curr. Opinion Immunol. 1999; 11: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 39Chan A.C. Shaw A.S. Curr. Opinion Immunol. 1996; 8: 394-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been shown that p59fyn and p56lck can phosphorylate phospholipase C-γ directly in vitro (40Liao F. Shin H.S. Rhee S.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 191: 1028-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Therefore, p59fyn and p56lck play a crucial role in Ca2+mobilization in T cells. The tyrosine phosphorylation of RyR described in this report may represent another mechanism by which p59fyn affects Ca2+ concentrations in T cells in vivo. Interestingly, tyrosine phosphorylation of RyR at the 2-min time point was in the same order of magnitude as compared with the band likely representing p59fyn (Fig. 2, left panel). It is difficult to relate these relative staining intensities to the proportion of RyR that are actually tyrosine-phosphorylated. However, even a smaller fraction of tyrosine-phosphorylated RyR may in fact be sufficient to act as a triggering system for Ca2+-induced Ca2+-release, thereby also engaging non-phosphorylated RyR. Thus, such a model is well compatible with a functional role of a tyrosine-phosphorylated subfraction of RyR during TCR/CD3-mediated Ca2+ signaling.Marks and colleagues (16Jayaraman T. Ondrias K. Ondriasova E. Marks A.R. Science. 1996; 272: 1492-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) have shown recently that the type 1 Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor is tyrosine-phosphorylated in Jurkat T cells upon stimulation of the TCR/CD3 complex. In addition, they could show that this phosphorylation increased the open probability of the isolated Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor as measured in lipid planar bilayer experiments (16Jayaraman T. Ondrias K. Ondriasova E. Marks A.R. Science. 1996; 272: 1492-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). To investigate a possible similar influence of tyrosine phosphorylation of the RyR of T cells, we have used permeabilized Jurkat T cells (29Guse A.H. da Silva C.P. Emmrich F. Ashamu G.A. Potter B.V.L. Mayr G.W. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 3353-3359PubMed Google Scholar). In such permeabilized cells, recombinant GST-p59fyn, but not GST-p56lck, GST-Grb2, or GST alone, concentration-dependently and specifically enhanced cADPR-mediated Ca2+ release in the presence of ATP and an ATP-regenerating system. Surprisingly, this effect required initial activation of RyR by cADPR. This activation changed two parameters of the system; first, [Ca2+] was elevated, and second, the RyR Ca2+ channels switched to the open conformation. Thus, one possible explanation would be that an elevated Ca2+concentration alone is sufficient for the catalytic effect of GST-p59fyn on RyR. However, GST-p59fyn does not require Ca2+ions for its catalytic activity. On the other hand, it is well demonstrated that Ca2+ ions act as agonists at the RyR and thereby induce a conformational change of the RyR/Ca2+channel, as visualized by cryo-electron microscopy and subsequent image processing techniques (41Sharma M.R. Jeyakumar L.H. Fleischer S. Wagenknecht T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9485-9491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This view is supported by the finding that activation of RyR by the agonists 4-CEP and Ca2+ was enhanced by GST-p59fyn in a similar way as for cADPR. Thus, conformational changes are very likely to result from binding of these three ligands (this statement does not necessary imply that cADPR binds directly to RyR; additional proteins may be involved here). A similar observation was made when the enhancement of Ins(1,4,5)P3 stimulation of the type 1 Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor from T cells by p59fyn was measured in bilayer experiments. In that case, the effect was observed only at high [Ca2+] at the cytosolic side, indicating a similar Ca2+-mediated conformational change of the type 1 InsP3 receptor (16Jayaraman T. Ondrias K. Ondriasova E. Marks A.R. Science. 1996; 272: 1492-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data indicate that the tyrosine residue(s) that could theoretically be phosphorylated by GST-p59fyn are not accessible when the RyR Ca2+ channel is in the closed conformation.In conclusion, we have shown transient tyrosine phosphorylation of the RyR of T cells in response to stimulation of the TCR/CD3 complex. In addition, in permeabilized cells Ca2+ release by cADPR and 4-CEP were significantly enhanced by GST-p59fyn. Our demonstration that the effect of GST-p59fynwas specific, concentration-dependent, and could be inhibited by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor PP2 provides strong evidence that tyrosine phosphorylation of RyR may play a crucial role in the early phase of T cell Ca2+ signaling and thereby may constitute an additional element of fine tuning of T lymphocyte Ca2+ signaling. In a broader context, our data provide first evidence that, in addition to serine/threonine protein kinases, PTKs are also involved in regulation of RyR. Ryanodine receptors (RyR)1 are large tetrameric Ca2+ channel-forming proteins. Three different isoforms of RyR have been identified, termed types 1, 2, and 3 (also known as skeletal muscle type RyR, cardiac muscle type RyR, and brain type RyR (reviewed in Ref. 1Sutko J.L. Airey J.A. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1027-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar)). There is indeed abundant expression of these particular isoforms in the respective tissues, but there is also increasing evidence for low expression of different RyR in other tissues (2Giannini G. Conti A. Mammarella S. Scrobogna M. Sorrentino V. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 893-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). In skeletal and cardiac muscle, RyR are the major intracellular Ca2+ release channels, which control co"

During sporulation, Bacillus thuringiensis produces a parasporal crystal body composed of one or more proteins that are toxic to a number of insect larvae (1Höfte H. Whiteley H.R. Microbiol.

After solubilization in the insect midgut and activation by intestinal proteases, these proteins bind to specific receptors at the surface of the apical brush border membrane of epithelial columnar cells, insert into the membrane, and form pores that disrupt midgut cellular functions (3Gill S.S.

Carroll J. Ellar D.J. Nature. 1991; 353: 815-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar, 7Grochulski P. Masson L. Borisova S. Pusztai-Carey M. Schwartz J.-L. Brousseau R. Cygler M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 447-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). In Cry1Aa, domains I and II are linked by four salt bridges: Asp222–Arg281, Arg233–Glu288, Arg234–Glu274, and Asp242–Arg265 (7Grochulski P. Masson L. Borisova S. Pusztai-Carey M. Schwartz J.-L. Brousseau R. Cygler M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 447-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar) (Fig.1). Three salt bridges, structurally equivalent to Arg233–Glu288, Arg234–Glu274, and Asp242–Arg265, are also found in Cry3A (6Li J. Carroll J. Ellar D.J. Nature. 1991; 353: 815-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar, 7Grochulski P. Masson L. Borisova S. Pusztai-Carey M. Schwartz J.-L. Brousseau R. Cygler M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 447-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). In addition, for all four salt bridges at least one of the amino acid residues forming the bridge is located within block 2, a sequence that is highly conserved among Cry toxins (1Höfte H. Whiteley H.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1989; 53: 242-255Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Schnepf E. Crickmore N. Van Rie J. Lereclus D. Baum J. Feitelson J. Zeigler D.R. Dean D.H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol.

However, only in the case of the Asp242–Arg265 salt bridge are both amino acids located within block 2 (Fig. 1). Salt bridges appear to play an important role in toxin stability and function. Mutations preventing the formation of the Asp242–Arg265(37Meza R. Nuñez-Valdez M.-E. Sanchez J. Bravo A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1996; 145: 333-339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Dean D.H.

Hussain S.R. Gene. 1996; 179: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) salt bridges in Cry1Ab resulted in substantial losses of stability or activity. The importance of these salt bridges is further supported by the observation that domain I exchanges between different Cry1 proteins can lead to inactive recombinant proteins (39Rang C. Vachon V. de Maagd R.A. Villalon M. Schwartz J.-L. Bosch D. Frutos R. Laprade R. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 2918-2925Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), possibly caused by the absence of one or more essential salt bridges. In contrast, disulfide bond engineering experiments with Cry1Aa have demonstrated that pore formation requires domain I to swing away from the rest of the molecule (14Schwartz J.-L. Juteau M. Grochulski P. Cygler M. Préfontaine G. Brousseau R. Masson L. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 397-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), implying that the interdomain salt bridges must be broken during toxin insertion into the membrane.In the present study, each of the four salt bridges in Cry1Aa was eliminated by site-directed mutagenesis. Because others have shown that Cry1A mutations at Asp242 or Arg265 may result in unstable proteins (37Meza R. Nuñez-Valdez M.-E. Sanchez J. Bravo A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1996; 145: 333-339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Dean D.H. Rajamohan F. Lee M.K. Wu S.-J. Chen X.J. Alcantara E. Hussain S.R. Gene. 1996; 179: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), various amino acid alterations were created at Asp242 including a double mutant D242A/R265A. Because the highly alkaline pH of the lepidopteran midgut, which ranges between 8 and 12 (40, 41), is thought to play an important role in toxin function (5Schnepf E. Crickmore N. Van Rie J. Lereclus D. Baum J. Feitelson J. Zeigler D.R. Dean D.H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 775-806Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), all stable mutants were tested at pH values of 7.5 and 10.5. Although all mutations caused a substantial loss in toxicity, several mutants retained a capacity to form pores in midgut brush border membrane vesicles that was comparable with that of the respective parental toxins.DISCUSSIONThe objective of the present study was to investigate the role of the salt bridges linking domains I and II in Cry1Aa and Cry1Ac. Although these two toxins, along with Cry1Ab, share a high level of homology and are therefore expected to have similar pore-forming properties, mutations preventing the formation of the Asp242–Arg265 salt bridge had diverse effects on expression, stability, and function. Whereas the Cry1Aa mutant D242A could be produced normally but had very poor toxicity and pore-forming ability, mutants in which the arginine at position 265 was replaced by an alanine residue in the same protein were extremely sensitive to degradation by trypsin. These results correlate well with those from previous studies showing that mutations at either Asp242, Arg265, or both positions in Cry1Ab resulted in unstable and inactive mutant proteins (37Meza R. Nuñez-Valdez M.-E. Sanchez J. Bravo A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1996; 145: 333-339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Dean D.H. Rajamohan F. Lee M.K. Wu S.-J. Chen X.J. Alcantara E. Hussain S.R. Gene. 1996; 179: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).Cry1Ac was modeled using the published Cry1Aa (7Grochulski P. Masson L. Borisova S. Pusztai-Carey M. Schwartz J.-L. Brousseau R. Cygler M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 447-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar) and Cry3A (6Li J. Carroll J. Ellar D.J. Nature. 1991; 353: 815-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar) three-dimensional structures as templates (54Peitsch M.C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 274-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). Interestingly, although Cry1Aa possesses four salt bridges in the interdomain region, there were only two salt bridges in Cry1Ac located in the same positions as those in Cry1Aa; no salt bridge was apparent between residues Asp222 and Arg281 or between residues Arg234 and Glu274. The predicted atomic distances of the Cry1Ac salt bridges are as follows: Arg233–Glu288, 2.85 Å, and Asp242–Arg265, 2.27 Å and 2.96 Å. The former salt bridge is identical to that found in Cry1Aa, whereas the latter appears to be stronger.The properties of the Cry1Ac Asp242 mutants depended greatly on the nature of the mutation. Whereas D242E and D242K could not be produced, D242N and D242P retained a wild-type pore-forming ability in brush border membrane vesicles. Although an effect on gene expression cannot be excluded, the extremely poor accumulation of D242E or D242K in the bacterial cell was likely due to a structural defect causing these mutant proteins to be rapidly degraded by endogenous proteases. In the case of D242K, normal polypeptide chain folding would result in the juxtaposition of two positive charges at a position normally occupied by a salt bridge. The replacement of the aspartic acid residue by a glutamic acid residue in D242E, however, does not introduce a modification in the charge of this residue but simply increases the length of its side chain by a single methylene group. This modification appears to be sufficient either to prevent the formation of the salt bridge by improper folding of the protein or, if the salt bridge is indeed formed, to introduce an angle or a gap between α-helix 7 and the β-sheet of domain II. This in turn may prevent the formation of the other salt bridges because the Asp242–Arg265 salt bridge is located nearest to the hinge region linking domains I and II (Fig. 1).The fact that D242N and D242P retained good pore-forming activity was surprising because a D242N mutant in Cry1Ab was among those previously reported to be unstable (37Meza R. Nuñez-Valdez M.-E. Sanchez J. Bravo A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1996; 145: 333-339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the introduction of a helix-interrupting proline residue at this position was expected to have profound effects on the structure of the protein by destabilizing the structure of α-helix 7. However, when examined by mutational analysis conducted with the Swiss PDB viewer software on the published structure of Cry1Aa and on that of Cry1Ac obtained by Swiss Model modeling, a D242P mutation in α-helix 7 was predicted to have very little effect on the structure of the helix and no overall effect on the Cry1Aa or Cry1Ac toxin structures. Following energy minimization, the single-site mutation resulted in a maximum displacement of 0.11 Å of the Cα atom at amino acid position 242. It should be noted, however, that of all the mutants tested in the present study D242N retained the strongest toxicity, and D242P was, along with D242A from Cry1Aa, the least toxic to M. sexta larvae.Mutations that prevented the formation of any single salt bridge linking domains I and II in Cry1Aa or the Asp242–Arg265 salt bridge in Cry1Ac clearly resulted in a substantial decrease in toxicity of the protein. At 2 μg of toxin/ml, a concentration 32-fold higher than the LC50 measured for Cry1Aa and 61-fold higher than that of Cry1Ac, only D222A and D242N were able to kill more than 50% of the larvae. The toxicity level retained by the Cry1Aa mutants was directly related to the position of the abolished salt bridge relative to the hinge region linking domains I and II (7Grochulski P. Masson L. Borisova S. Pusztai-Carey M. Schwartz J.-L. Brousseau R. Cygler M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 447-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Removal of the salt bridge located farthest from the hinge region (D222A, Fig. 1) resulted in a toxin with the highest toxicity, whereas elimination of the salt bridge located closest to the hinge region (D242A) rendered the mutant protein essentially non-toxic. R233A and R234A, in which the salt bridges located near the middle of α-helix 7 were abolished, retained an intermediate level of toxicity.Except for D242A, a reduction in toxicity could not be attributed to a loss in the pore-forming ability of the mutants. The increase in vesicle permeability to KCl, sucrose, and raffinose observed with each of the active mutants was comparable with that observed with the respective parental toxins following a 60-min preincubation of the vesicles with the toxin. Moreover, the rate at which membrane permeability increased following exposure to the toxin was at least as high for the mutants as for the wild-type toxins. These results contrast with those of another study in which the R233A mutant of Cry1Ab was found to have a significantly reduced ability to inhibit the short circuit current through the epithelium of midguts isolated fromLymantria dispar (38Dean D.H. Rajamohan F. Lee M.K. Wu S.-J. Chen X.J. Alcantara E. Hussain S.R. Gene. 1996; 179: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).With the Cry1Aa mutant D222A at pH 7.5 and all three Cry1Aa active mutants at pH 10.5, membrane permeability increased faster upon exposure to the mutants than in the presence of the parental toxin. This result suggests that the removal of one of the salt bridges facilitates the insertion of the toxin into the membrane, at least under in vitro conditions. Interestingly, at pH 10.5 the rate at which vesicle permeability increased in the presence of these mutant toxins correlated with toxicity and, as mentioned above, with the position of the missing salt bridge relative to the hinge region. A faster rate of membrane insertion may increase the toxicity of the mutants by reducing the time they are exposed to proteases in the midgut. Cry1Aa was nevertheless considerably more toxic than any of its mutants, and removal of a salt bridge is very likely to have increased the susceptibility of the mutants to midgut proteases.Cases of toxins with a strong capacity to form pores in vitro despite a relatively poor toxicity have been reported previously (25Masson L. Mazza A. Gringorten L. Baines D. Anelunias V. Brousseau R. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 851-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 55Peyronnet O. Vachon V. Brousseau R. Baines D. Schwartz J.-L.

As was discussed extensively (55Peyronnet O. Vachon V. Brousseau R. Baines D. Schwartz J.-L. Laprade R. Appl. Envriron. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 1679-1684Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), this may result from a poorer stability or a stronger sensitivity to proteolysis under the harsh conditions encountered in the insect midgut than in the somewhat idealized in vitro conditions. Among the intestinal factors that could affect toxin activity, the strongly alkaline pH characteristic of the larval midgut of lepidopteran insects (40Dow J.A.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246: R633-R635PubMed Google Scholar, 41Dow J.A.T. J. Exp. Biol. 1992; 172: 355-375PubMed Google Scholar) had only minor effects on the in vitro activity of Cry1Aa and Cry1Ac. A slightly higher permeability to sucrose and raffinose was nevertheless observed at pH 10.5 than at pH 7.5, consistent with a slight increase in pore size with increasing pH as was previously reported for Cry1Ac (57Carroll J. Ellar D.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 797-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). A similar effect of pH was observed for all three Cry1Aa mutants, but it was not detected with either of the Cry1Ac mutants.In conclusion, our results along with those of other laboratories (37Meza R. Nuñez-Valdez M.-E. Sanchez J. Bravo A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1996; 145: 333-339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,38Dean D.H. Rajamohan F. Lee M.K. Wu S.-J. Chen X.J. Alcantara E. Hussain S.R. Gene. 1996; 179: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) clearly show that the interdomain salt bridges linking domains I and II play an important role in toxin stability and toxicity. Presumably, these salt bridges are necessary to maintain the toxin in a tightly packed conformation in the midgut until, after binding to its membrane receptor, the toxin undergoes a conformational change leading to insertion into the membrane and pore formation. In the absence of proteases or other intestinal factors yet to be identified, removal of either one of these salt bridges does not necessarily alter the toxin's capacity to form a pore in the midgut membrane. On the other hand, under in vitro conditions removal of a salt bridge can even increase the rate of pore formation by Cry1Aa. During sporulation, Bacillus thuringiensis produces a parasporal crystal body composed of one or more proteins that are toxic to a number of insect larvae (1Höfte H. Whiteley H.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1989; 53: 242-255Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or to other invertebrates (2Feitelson J.S. Payne J. Kim L. Bio/Technology. 1992; 10: 271-275Crossref Scopus (397) Google Scholar). After solubilization in the insect midgut and activation by intestinal proteases, these proteins bind to specific receptors at the surface of the apical brush border membrane of epithelial columnar cells, insert into the membrane, and form pores that disrupt midgut cellular functions (3Gill S.S.

Although numerous experiments have documented the role of E2F sites and E2F activities in the control of these genes as cells exit from G0 to move through the initial G1/S phase transition, almost nothing is known on the role of E2Fs during the subsequent cell cycles. Here we show that a variant E2F-site that is part of the Cyclin E Repressor Module (CERM) (Le Cam et al., 1999b) accounts for the periodic down regulation of the cyclin E promoter observed between the exit from mitosis until the mid/late G1 phase in exponentially cycling cells. This cell cycle-dependent repression correlates with the periodic binding of an atypical G1-specific high molecular weight p107-E2F complex (Cyclin E Repressor Complex: CERC2) that differs in both size and DNA binding behaviors from known p107-E2F complexes. Notably, affinity purified CERC2 displays a TSA-sensitive histone deacetylase activity and, consistent with this, derepression of the cyclin E promoter by trichostatin A depends on the CERM element. Altogether, this shows that the cell cycle-dependent control of cyclin E promoter in cycling cells is embroiled in acetylation pathways via the CERM-like E2F element."
https://openalex.org/W2079060257,"Chromosomal fusion of the N-terminal region of the Ewings Sarcoma Oncogene (EWS-activation-domain, EAD) to the DNA-binding domains of a variety of cellular transcription factors produce oncogenic proteins (EWS-fusion proteins (EFPs)) that cause distinct malignancies. In EFPs, the EAD acts as a potent transcriptional activation domain and this ability is repressed in the context of normal, non-tumorigenic, EWS. Trans-activation by the EAD is therefore a specific characteristic of EFPs and it is thought that EFPs induce tumorigenesis via improper transcriptional activation of cellular genes. Functional elements required for transcriptional activation are dispersed throughout the EAD, as are thirty-one copies of a Degenerate Hexapeptide Repeat (DHR, consensus SYGQQS). This suggests that the EAD contains a highly reiterated functional element related to DHRs. Here we show that in the context of EWS/ATF1, the EFP that causes malignant melanoma of soft parts, trans-cooperation by small regions of the EAD ( approximately 30 residues) results in potent transcriptional activation dependent on the conserved tyrosine residues present in DHRs. These findings provide the first evidence for a role of DHRs in EAD-mediated trans-activation and demonstrate that the EAD represents a novel tyrosine-dependent transcriptional activation domain."

Listowsky I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 357-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). These proteins are ∼80-kDa single chain proteins and have the ability to bind very tightly but reversibly two Fe3+ together with two CO32− anions (1Aisen P. Listowsky I. Annu. Rev.

Ovotransferrin, a major egg white protein, should share the same structural characteristics as hen serum transferrin, because these proteins are derived from the same gene and differ only in their attached carbohydrate (2Thibodeau S.N. Lee D.C. Palmiter R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 3771-3774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, several lines of in vitroevidence have demonstrated that ovotransferrin possesses the cellular Fe3+ transport function (3Mason A.B Woodworth R.C. J. Biol.

The Fe3+transporter transferrins mediate the delivery of Fe3+ to the target cells through the interaction with the specific transferrin receptor; the Fe3+-loaded transferrins are first bound by the receptor on the plasma membrane and then internalized by the cell into the endosome where Fe3+ release takes place in an acidic environment (8Klausner R.D.

The anion-induced Fe3+ release by transferrins, therefore, should be closely related to the opening of the domains in either lobe. Upon the transition from the closed to open conformation, the two domains of the N- and C-lobes behave as rigid bodies and the conformational change almost lies in the hinge regions that link the two domains (32Gerstein M.

Such a mode of conformational transition in transferrins has been pointed out to be a typical example of the hinge motion mechanism in multidomain proteins that undergo significant conformational transition upon exertion of the biologically important functions (34Gerstein M.

When the functional characteristics are compared for the N- and C-lobes of transferrins, the effects of anions on the Fe3+ release kinetics are strikingly different for the two lobes. The rate for the anion-mediated Fe3+ release is much slower from the C-lobe than from the N-lobe (35Kretchmar S.A. Raymond K.N. J. Am. Chem.

Ross D. Purves L.R. Adams P.A. Inorg. Chem. 1992; 31: 1994-1998Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Detailed structural and functional comparisons between the N- and C-lobes of transferrins may provide crucial information about the hinge motion mechanism of biologically important multidomain proteins. As a promising strategy for understanding the structural and functional differences, direct comparison between the isolated N- and C-lobes in terms of the crystal structure and quantitative Fe3+release kinetics should be crucial. There is, however, no report about the crystal structure or Fe3+ release kinetics for the isolated C-lobe, despite a large number of publications for the isolated N-lobes (21Sarra R. Garratt R.

This is probably due to the absence of an efficient C-lobe recombinant expression system and to the difficulty in its proteolytic isolation from whole transferrin molecule except for ovotransferrin (44Oe H. Doi E. Hirose M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1988; 103: 1066-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Furthermore, few attempts have been made to figure out a model for the Fe3+ release pathway on the basis of a quantitative kinetic analysis and to correlate the obtained kinetic pathway with the anion-binding structure. In the present paper, we demonstrate, for the first time, the x-ray crystallographic structure and the results from quantitative kinetic analyses for an isolated C-lobe. The anion-dependent Fe3+ release from C-oTf at the endosomal pH 5.6 follows a single exponential progress curve, and the obtained apparent first order rate constants display a hyperbolic profile as a function of anion concentrations. From the curve fitting analysis for the profile using a quantitative rate equation, a single Fe3+ release pathway model is found to be the most feasible one; in this model, the holo form is converted depending on the anion concentration into a “mixed ligand” intermediate that releases Fe3+. To evaluate this kinetic model on the structural basis, C-oTf has been crystallized as the apo form in ammonium sulfate solution and solved for its three-dimensional structure at 2.3 Å resolution. The solved structure represents the existence of a single bound SO42− with reasonably low B factors in the opened interdomain clef; the bound SO42− interacts directly with Thr461-OG1, Tyr431-OH, and His592-NE2 and indirectly with Tyr524-OH. The latter three residue groups correspond to Fe3+-coordinating ligands, strongly suggesting the facilitated Fe3+ release upon the anion occupation for the site. The structural characteristics of the SO42− binding site can be successfully used to support and substantiate the single-pathway kinetic model. Taken together with previous crystallographic (39Mizutani K. Yamashita H. Mikami B. Hirose M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3258-3265Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and kinetic (43Muralidhara B.K. Hirose M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12463-12469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) data for isolated ovotransferrin N-lobe, the present data for C-oTf should provide crucial information about structural implications for the functional difference in the N- and C-lobes of transferrins. C-oTf (Glu342–Lys686; for clarity the amino acid numbering of the full-length ovotransferrin is retained) was isolated and purified from hen egg white as reported earlier (44Oe H. Doi E. Hirose M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1988; 103: 1066-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Guaranteed grade of chemicals, including pyrophosphoric acid from Wako Pure Chemicals and NTA and Na2SO4 from Nacalai Tesque, were used for the kinetic and crystallographic studies. The protein concentration of C-oTf was measured in the apo form and iron bound holo form was prepared freshly in 100 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, using Fe3+-NTA complex as the iron donor and large excess bicarbonate as the synergistic anion to replace the bound NTA. The holo form was then equilibrated to 50 mm Mes, pH 5.6, by dialysis, and the bound iron was confirmed spectrophotometrically to retain at 1:1 molar ratio with protein. Nitric acid-washed glassware and double distilled and deionized water were used. Extreme care was taken to avoid any metal contamination and alteration of pH in all the solutions. All of the anion stock solutions were prepared freshly just before use in 50 mm Mes, and the pH was adjusted to 5.60 using NaOH. The fast kinetics was measured using fluorescence mode of SX.18MV stopped flow reaction analyzer (Applied Photophysics Ltd.) as described in detail previously (43Muralidhara B.K. Hirose M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12463-12469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Measurement of complete iron release at pH 5.6 using different concentrations of anions were, however, unsuccessful within the maximum time limit of the instrument (1000 s) because of the slow rate iron release from C-oTf. The complete iron removal was monitored using a Hitachi F-3000 conventional fluorescence spectrophotometer at 30 ± 0.1 °C. The excitation and emission wavelengths were 285 and 330 nm, respectively. A protein concentration of 0.2 μm was used in all the experiments. The kinetic experiments were always initiated by the addition of holo protein to a buffered anion/chelator solutions, and data points were collected every 10 s. The monophasic progress curves were best fit to a single exponential using Equation 1 either by using built-in software in the stopped flow apparatus or by plotting the data points and analyzing using KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software).Z(t)=1−exp(−kobst)Equation 1 where Z(t) is the fraction of iron released (apo) form as detected by the change in fluorescence emission intensity at time t and k obs is the observed first order rate constant. A minimum of three independent measurements for each anion concentration were done, and the averagek obs values were used for analysis. The apo form of C-oTf was crystallized using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. The solution in the crystallization drop was prepared on a silanized coverslip by mixing 5 μl of protein solution (25.0 mg/ml, pH 6.0, 0.05 macetate buffer) with 5 μl of precipitant solution (55% ammonium sulfate, pH 6.0, 0.05 m acetate buffer). The droplets were equilibrated against 1 ml of the precipitant solution at 20 °C. The crystals were obtained within 1 month. The apo crystals were subjected to diffraction experiments using a Nonius precession camera with nickel-filtered CuKα radiation generated by a Rigaku x-ray generator (40 kV, 20 mA). The precession photographs indicated that the apo crystal belongs to space group P21212 with cell dimensions ofa = 103.58, b = 81.13, andc = 50.08 Å (α = β = γ = 90°). Diffraction data were collected using CuKα radiation (1.5418 Å) with a Bruker Hi-star multiwire detector coupled to Mac Science M18XHF rotating anode generator. A total of 66,969 reflections were collected to 2.25 Å. The data were processed, scaled, and merged with the Saint program (Bruker Analytical X-ray Instruments, Inc., Madison, WI). For multiple isomorphous replacement (MIR), the crystals were soaked at 20 °C in the precipitant solution containing 0.2 mm p-chloromercuribenzene sulfonate, 2.0 mmK2PtCl4, 5.0 mmSm2(SO4)3, 5.0 mmKAuCl4, 1.0 mmUO2(CH3COO)2, 10 mmAgNO3, or 5.0 mm methylmercury hydroxide. A number of heavy atom derivative data sets were collected and processed in the same way. Only K2PtCl4, Sm2(SO4)3, and UO2(CH3COO)2 derivatives were, however, able to be used for MIR phasing. Details of the crystal parameter and statistics of the data sets are given in Table II. Three platinum (Pt−), one samarium (Sm−), and two uranium (U−) binding sites were obtained with the difference Patterson and difference Fourier methods using the program PHASES. The obtained MIR phase was improved by solvent flattening with PHASES. Statistics of the phasing are shown in Table II. The electron density map was made with the solvent-flattened MIR phase using the data between 15.0 and 3.5 Å. Domain 1 and domain 2 of the C-lobe of the apo-ovotransferrin whole molecule (1AIV, 3.0 Å resolution) were translated and rotated to fit the map, respectively, using TURBO-FRODO.Table IISummary of data collection and refinementNativeK2PtCl4Sm2(SO4)3UO2(CH3COO)2Crystal data Space groupP21212P21212P21212P21212 Cell dimensionsa(Å)103.58103.76104.50104.53b(Å)81.1381.5382.1082.34c(Å)50.0850.2650.2950.62 V m(Å3/Da)2.6 Molecules per asymmetric unit1 Observed reflections66,96945,54120,47957,843 Resolution (Å)2.252.643.132.70 Independent reflections14,49511,9047,19711,972Completeness (%)70.190.788.994.7 R sym(%)5.88.55.821.9 SoakConcentration (mm)2.05.01.0Time (h)2148 Phasing (∞ − 3.5 Å)R culis(centric)0.6010.6060.602R kraut(acentric)0.2070.0950.110Number of heavy atoms312Phasing power0.951.361.68Figure of merit0.517Figure of merit after solvent flattening0.795Refinement statistics Resolution limits (Å)10.0–2.30 No. of reflections used (F > 2ς(F))12,159Completeness (%)63.6 No. of protein atoms2,647 No. of solvent molecules46 Ions1SO42− FinalR factor0.186 Free R value0.239 Average B-factor (Å2)42.2 r.m.s. deviation from ideal geometryBond distances (Å)0.0051Bond angles (deg.)1.23Dihedrals (deg.)22.1Improper dihedrals (deg.)0.725Conditions for crystallization Concentration of the protein (mg/ml)25.0 Buffer50 mm acetate pH6.0 Precipitant55% ammonium sulfate Salt0.2 mMgCl2Native is the apo crystal without the soaking with a metal ion.

The initial model made using the MIR map and the structure of the whole molecule of ovotransferrin was refined by simulated annealing with molecular dynamics using a slowly cooling protocol implemented in X-PLOR (45Brünger A.T. Karplus M. Petsko G.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1989; 45: 50-61Crossref Scopus (271) Google Scholar) from 3000 to 300 K.

Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16919) Google Scholar) up to the resolution of 2.3 Å, followed by manual model building, were carried out to improve the model. One sulfate anion and water molecules and a carbohydrate moiety (N-acetyl glucosamine) having more than 3 ς on theF o − F c map were then added to the model. The final model consisted of 341 amino acid residues, one sulfate anion, and 46 water molecules with a Rvalue of 0.186 (R free = 0.239) for 12,159 reflections with F > 2ς(F) between 10.0 and 2.30 Å resolution (Table II). The electron density maps (2F o −F c, contoured at 1 ς) were calculated using the reflection data at 10–2.3 Å resolution. The omit maps (F o − F c, contoured at 3 ς) were obtained from the model in which a sulfate molecule was excluded. To investigate the functional characteristics of ovotransferrin C-lobe, we did kinetic analyses for the anion-dependent Fe3+ release from C-oTf. Initially, Fe3+ release kinetics was monitored using the stopped flow method, and clear monophasic progress curves were obtained at different concentrations of pyrophosphate, sulfate, and NTA. Although none of the anions yielded complete iron removal in the time span of 1000 s limited to the stopped flow equipment, the data points, including the ones at very early time after the stopped flow mixing, were best fitted to the single exponential of Equation 1. This was quite different from the Fe3+ release kinetics of the isolated N-lobe of ovotransferrin, which displays clear biphasic progress curves under the same conditions (43Muralidhara B.K. Hirose M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12463-12469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Monophasic progress curves have been also observed with the C-lobe monoferric human serum transferrin (47Marques H.M. Walton T. Egan T.J. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1995; 57: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). For the quantitative analysis of the Fe3+ release kinetics, the complete iron removal time course must be followed. The kinetic analysis of Fe3+ release was therefore done using a conventional spectrofluorometer. Clear monophasic time course data were again obtained for all the three anions during the complete iron removal within the reasonable time limit of measurement (maximum 90 min), which is not affected by the instrumental drift. Fig.1 shows the apparent first order rate constants obtained by the single exponential curve fit of the raw data to Equation 1 as a function of pyrophosphate concentration (Fig.1 A). Kinetic measurements below 20 mmpyrophosphate concentration were unsuccessful because of incomplete Fe3+ removal within the time span. Thek obs values obtained showed an apparent hyperbolic relation with an increase in the pyrophosphate concentration. The same analysis was done for the other two anions of different chemical nature: sulfate, which is a simple nonsynergistic anion, and NTA, a weak chelator anion that can also act as a synergistic anion (48Schlabach M.R. Bates G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 2182-2188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In B and C of Fig. 1 we show the dependence of k obs values as functions of sulfate and NTA concentrations, respectively, and in both the cases they appear to follow a hyperbolic pattern. NTA experiments above 100 mmwere unsuccessful because of strong interference of NTA fluorescence with the one from protein under identical experimental conditions. The simplest model that is consistent with a nonlinear (apparent hyperbolic) relation of the k obs value with anion concentrations (Fig.1) is represented by Scheme FS1, whereX represents the synergistic carbonate anion bound holo C-oTf and Y represents an additional anion (pyrophosphate, sulfate, or NTA) bound different conformer of X. The reversible interconversion of X and Y are driven by apparent first order rate constants K 1 andK 2, and Fe3+ release can occur only from the Y form with the apparent first order rate constantK 3 leading to the iron-free apo form,Z. The constants K 1,K 2, and K 3 correspond to the true first order rate constants or pseudo first order rate constant, depending on their anion concentration dependence. The fraction of the apo form (Z) at Fe3+ releasing time t can be expressed by a double-exponential equation as follows. Z(t)=1−{r2/(r2−r1)}exp(−r1t)+{r1/(r2−r1)}exp(−r2t)Equation 2 The apparent rate constants r 1 andr 2 are related to the rate constants,K 1, K 2, andK 3.r1=α−(α2−β)1/2Equation 3 r2=α+(α2−β)1/2Equation 4 2α=K1+K2+K3Equation 5 β=K1K3Equation 6 Equation 2 should give rise to a concave type of the biphasic Fe3+ release time course. The apparent monophasic time courses, as observed, can be obtained when r 2 is much higher than r 1. In this case (r 2 ≫ r 1), Equation 2can be shown by the following equation.Z(t)=1−exp(−r1t)Equation 7 Equation 7 yields the monophasic time course with the relationk obs = r 1. Because the Fe3+ release rate clearly depends on the anion concentration (Fig. 1) and because the anion binding as a crucial step for the Fe3+ release (49Cowart R.E. Swope S. Loh T.T. Chasteen N.D. Bates G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 281: 4607-4614Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) has been widely believed, it was examined by curve fitting analysis of the k obsdata to Equation 7 whether the apparent first order rate constants (K 1, K 2, andK 3) are true first order rate constants or pseudo first order rate constants that correspond to the product of second order rate constant and anion concentration. When onlyK 3 is the pseudo first order rate constant, the curve fitting of k obs data to Equation 7 yielded a good fit for all the three anions, but large errors were obtained for both K 2 and K 3 values. The case of anion dependence of both K 1 andK 3 did not yield any good curve fitting. The best curve fitting results were obtained when K 1is a pseudo first order rate constant, but K 2and K 3 are true first order rate constants. The solid curves in Fig. 1 are the curve fit lines for Equation 7 using the relation, K 1 = k 1[A], where k 1 and [A] are a second order rate constant and an anion concentration, respectively. For all the three anions, the curve fit l"
https://openalex.org/W2314579246,"Class II transactivator (CIITA) is required for both constitutive and inducible expression of MHC class II genes. IFN-gamma induced expression of CIITA in various cell types is directed by CIITA type IV promoter. The two transactivators, STAT1 and IRF-1, mediate the IFN-gamma activation of the type IV promoter by binding to the GAS and IRF-E of the promoter, respectively. In addition to IRF-1, IRF-2, another member of the IRF family, also activates the human CIITA type IV promoter, and IRF-2 cooperates with IRF-1 to activate the promoter in transient transfection assays. IRF-1 and IRF-2 can co-occupy the IRF-E of the human CIITA type IV promoter. To understand the effect of loss of IRF-2 on the endogenous CIITA expression, we assayed for CIITA expression in IRF-2 knock-out mice. Both basal and IFN-gamma induced CIITA expression were reduced in IRF-2 knock-out mice. At least half of the amount of inducible CIITA mRNA depends on IRF-2. The reduction of IFN-gamma induced CIITA mRNA in IRF-2 knock-out mice was due to the reduction of the type IV CIITA mRNA induction. The reduction of basal CIITA mRNA was apparently due to the reduction of CIITA mRNA originating from other promoters. These data indicate that IRF-2, like IRF-1, plays a critical role in the regulation of the endogenous CIITA gene. The implications in understanding the previously described phenotypes of IRF-2 defective mice are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2029775518,"Hematopoietic cytokines are critically required for survival and cell proliferation of myeloid and erythroid progenitors. It is poorly understood how the apoptotic machinery of progenitor cells senses the absence of specific cytokines. Here we show that G1-Cdk activity is essential for cytokine-mediated viability of myeloid and erythroid progenitors. Cytokine deprivation is associated with rapid downregulation of G1-Cdk activity, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. Specific inhibition of G1-Cdk activity results in apoptotic cell death in the presence of saturating cytokine levels. In contrast, specific cell cycle arrest in G2/M does not affect viability. When cell proliferation is arrested by cytokine withdrawal, primary erythroid progenitors expressing v-ErbA maintain G1-Cdk activity and undergo delayed apoptosis. Cdk-inhibitors strongly enhance apoptosis in starved v-ErbA cells, indicating that sustained Cdk activity is required for protection from apoptosis by v-ErbA."
