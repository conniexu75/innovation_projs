https://openalex.org/W2097387056,"The study of gastric epithelial homeostasis and cancer has been hampered by the lack of stem cell markers and in vitro culture methods. The Wnt target gene Lgr5 marks stem cells in the small intestine, colon, and hair follicle. Here, we investigated Lgr5 expression in the stomach and assessed the stem cell potential of the Lgr5(+ve) cells by using in vivo lineage tracing. In neonatal stomach, Lgr5 was expressed at the base of prospective corpus and pyloric glands, whereas expression in the adult was predominantly restricted to the base of mature pyloric glands. Lineage tracing revealed these Lgr5(+ve) cells to be self-renewing, multipotent stem cells responsible for the long-term renewal of the gastric epithelium. With an in vitro culture system, single Lgr5(+ve) cells efficiently generated long-lived organoids resembling mature pyloric epithelium. The Lgr5 stem cell marker and culture method described here will be invaluable tools for accelerating research into gastric epithelial renewal, inflammation/infection, and cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1972348350,"Differentiated macrophages are the resident tissue phagocytes and sentinel cells of the innate immune response. The phenotype of mature tissue macrophages represents the composite of environmental and differentiation-dependent imprinting. Phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (VD(3)) are stimuli commonly used to induce macrophage differentiation in monocytic cell lines but the extent of differentiation in comparison to primary tissue macrophages is unclear. We have compared the phenotype of the promonocytic THP-1 cell line after various protocols of differentiation utilising VD(3) and PMA in comparison to primary human monocytes or monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM). Both stimuli induced changes in cell morphology indicative of differentiation but neither showed differentiation comparable to MDM. In contrast, PMA treatment followed by 5 days resting in culture without PMA (PMAr) increased cytoplasmic to nuclear ratio, increased mitochondrial and lysosomal numbers and altered differentiation-dependent cell surface markers in a pattern similar to MDM. Moreover, PMAr cells showed relative resistance to apoptotic stimuli and maintained levels of the differentiation-dependent anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1 similar to MDM. PMAr cells retained a high phagocytic capacity for latex beads, and expressed a cytokine profile that resembled MDM in response to TLR ligands, in particular with marked TLR2 responses. Moreover, both MDM and PMAr retained marked plasticity to stimulus-directed polarization. These findings suggest a modified PMA differentiation protocol can enhance macrophage differentiation of THP-1 cells and identify increased numbers of mitochondria and lysosomes, resistance to apoptosis and the potency of TLR2 responses as important discriminators of the level of macrophage differentiation for transformed cells."
https://openalex.org/W2088514819,"Background Bisphenol A (BPA) is a high production volume chemical widely used in food and drinks packaging. Associations have previously been reported between urinary BPA concentrations and heart disease, diabetes and liver enzymes in adult participants of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003/04. We aimed to estimate associations between urinary BPA concentrations and health measures in NHANES 2005/06 and in data pooled across collection years. Methodology and Findings A cross-sectional analysis of NHANES: subjects were n = 1455 (2003/04) and n = 1493 (2005/06) adults aged 18–74 years, representative of the general adult population of the United States. Regression models were adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, income, smoking, BMI, waist circumference, and urinary creatinine concentration. Main outcomes were reported diagnoses of heart attack, coronary heart disease, angina and diabetes and serum liver enzyme levels. Urinary BPA concentrations in 2005/06 (geometric mean 1.79 ng/ml, 95% CI: 1.64 to 1.96) were lower than in 2003/04 (2.49 ng/ml, CI: 2.20 to 2.83, difference p-value = 0.00002). Higher BPA concentrations were associated with coronary heart disease in 2005/06 (OR per z-score increase in BPA = 1.33, 95%CI: 1.01 to 1.75, p = 0.043) and in pooled data (OR = 1.42, CI: 1.17 to 1.72, p = 0.001). Associations with diabetes did not reach significance in 2005/06, but pooled estimates remained significant (OR = 1.24, CI: 1.10 to 1.40, p = 0.001). There was no overall association with gamma glutamyl transferase concentrations, but pooled associations with alkaline phosphatase and lactate dehydrogenase remained significant. Conclusions Higher BPA exposure, reflected in higher urinary concentrations of BPA, is consistently associated with reported heart disease in the general adult population of the USA. Studies to clarify the mechanisms of these associations are urgently needed."

While siRNAs in addition act in transcriptional gene silencing, a role of miRNAs in transcriptional regulation has been less clear. We show here that in moss Physcomitrella patens mutants without a DICER-LIKE1b gene, maturation of miRNAs is normal but cleavage of target RNAs is abolished and levels of these transcripts are drastically reduced. These mutants accumulate miRNA:target-RNA duplexes and show hypermethylation of the genes encoding target RNAs, leading to gene silencing. This pathway occurs also in the wild-type upon hormone treatment. We propose that initiation of epigenetic silencing by DNA methylation depends on the ratio of the miRNA and its target RNA. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) control gene expression in animals and plants. Like another class of small RNAs, siRNAs, they affect gene expression posttranscriptionally.

The moss DICER-LIKE1a (PpDCL1a) protein is required for miRNA biogenesis The related PpDCL1b protein is required for target cleavage but not miRNA biogenesis In PpDCL1b mutants, genes encoding miRNA targets are silenced by DNA methylation This epigenetic gene silencing is initiated by high miRNA to target RNA ratios Small RNAs (sRNAs) are potent regulators of posttranscriptional and transcriptional gene expression (Carthew and Sontheimer, 2009Carthew R.W. Sontheimer E.J. Origins and Mechanisms of miRNAs and siRNAs.Cell. 2009; 136: 642-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3435) Google Scholar, Voinnet, 2009Voinnet O. Origin, biogenesis, and activity of plant microRNAs.Cell. 2009; 136: 669-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1555) Google Scholar). In plants, miRNAs produced from hairpin-like precursor transcripts are also required for the biogenesis of trans-acting small interfering RNAs (ta-siRNAs). Both miRNAs and ta-siRNAs regulate mRNA stability and translation. Another class of sRNAs, siRNAs, processed from perfectly double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), posttranscriptionally silence transposons, viruses, and transgenes and are important for DNA methylation (Baulcombe, 2004Baulcombe D. RNA silencing in plants.Nature. 2004; 431: 356-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (1747) Google Scholar, Matzke et al., 2007Matzke M. Kanno T. Huettel B. Daxinger L. Matzke A.J. Targets of RNA-directed DNA methylation.Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2007; 10: 512-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Evidence for a similar function of microRNAs (miRNAs) in DNA methylation is limited. The biogenesis of sRNAs from dsRNA is catalyzed by Dicer proteins. The number of different Dicer proteins varies between organisms, reflecting different degrees of specialization. For example, in D. melanogaster, Dcr1 produces miRNAs from hairpin precursors, whereas Dcr2 generates siRNAs from dsRNA (Tomari and Zamore, 2005Tomari Y. Zamore P.D. Perspective: machines for RNAi.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 517-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar), while in C. elegans the only Dicer protein produces sRNAs from different dsRNA triggers (Duchaine et al., 2006Duchaine T.F. Wohlschlegel J.A. Kennedy S. Bei Y. Conte Jr., D. Pang K. Brownell D.R. Harding S. Mitani S.

Besides their function in dicing dsRNA, animal Dicers together with accessory proteins act in RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) or RISC loading complexes (Doi et al., 2003Doi N. Zenno S. Ueda R. Ohki-Hamazaki H. Ui-Tei K. Saigo K. Short-interfering-RNA-mediated gene silencing in mammalian cells requires Dicer and eIF2C translation initiation factors.Curr.

A Dicer-2-dependent 80s complex cleaves targeted mRNAs during RNAi in Drosophila.Cell. 2004; 117: 83-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Thus, Dicer proteins are also essential components in the executive phase of RNA interference (RNAi), indicating that miRNA/siRNA processing and target RNA cleavage are coupled. In the seed plant A. thaliana, four Dicer proteins (AtDCL1–4) act in different sRNA pathways (Gasciolli et al., 2005Gasciolli V. Mallory A.C. Bartel D.P. Vaucheret H.

Dissecting Arabidopsis thaliana DICER function in small RNA processing, gene silencing and DNA methylation patterning.Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 721-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). The maturation of miRNAs from imperfect RNA foldbacks relies on AtDCL1. In consequence, Atdcl1 mutants show reduced miRNA levels and increased target mRNA levels, resulting in multiple developmental defects (Golden et al., 2002Golden T.A. Schauer S.E. Lang J.D. Pien S. Mushegian A.R. Grossniklaus U. Meinke D.W. Ray A.

Biol. 2002; 12: 1484-1495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). AtDCL2 mediates the generation of siRNAs from exogenous RNA (Xie et al., 2004Xie Z. Johansen L.K. Gustafson A.M. Kasschau K.D. Lellis A.D. Zilberman D. Jacobsen S.E. Carrington J.C. Genetic and functional diversification of small RNA pathways in plants.PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: E104Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar), AtDCL3 acts in the formation of heterochromatin-associated endogenous siRNAs (Herr et al., 2005Herr A.J.

Genetic and functional diversification of small RNA pathways in plants.PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: E104Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar), and AtDCL4 is needed for the formation of ta-siRNAs acting in cell-to-cell transmission of silencing signals (Dunoyer et al., 2005Dunoyer P. Himber C. Voinnet O. DICER-LIKE 4 is required for RNA interference and produces the 21-nucleotide small interfering RNA component of the plant cell-to-cell silencing signal.Nat.

USA. 2005; 102: 12984-12989Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). A moss, Physcomitrella patens, likewise harbors four DCL proteins (Axtell et al., 2007Axtell M.J. Snyder J.A. Bartel D.P. Common functions for diverse small RNAs of land plants.Plant Cell. 2007; 19: 1750-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). PpDCL1a and PpDCL1b are similar to AtDCL1. PpDCL3 and PpDCL4 are orthologs of AtDCL3 and AtDCL4, whereas an AtDCL2 ortholog is lacking. Like AtDCL1, the primary PpDCL1a transcript harbors an intronic miRNA precursor, suggesting a conserved autoregulatory control (Axtell et al., 2007Axtell M.J. Snyder J.A. Bartel D.P. Common functions for diverse small RNAs of land plants.Plant Cell. 2007; 19: 1750-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). We created null mutants of PpDCL1a and PpDCL1b, respectively, by reverse genetics. Their analysis revealed significant functional differences between both proteins and suggest a feedback control of gene expression involving miRNAs and DNA methylation. Utilizing efficient gene targeting in P. patens (Strepp et al., 1998Strepp R. Scholz S. Kruse S. Speth V. Reski R. Plant nuclear gene knockout reveals a role in plastid division for the homolog of the bacterial cell division protein FtsZ, an ancestral tubulin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1998; 95: 4368-4373Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), we generated two PpDCL1a null mutants (ΔPpDCL1a) (Figure S1 available online). Loss of PpDCL1a resulted in developmental disorders and abnormalities in cell size and shape. Growth of the mutants was severely retarded on minimal medium but slightly better when supplied with vitamins and glucose. In all conditions, ΔPpDCL1a were developmentally arrested at the filamentous protonema and did not form leafy stems (Figures 1A and 1B, and Figures S2G and S2H).Figure 1Analysis of ΔPpDCL1a MutantsShow full caption(A) Protonema of identical density from the WT and two ΔPpDCL1a mutants grown for 28 days on solid medium.(B) Protonema grown in liquid culture.(C) RT-PCR of miR156, 160, 166, and 390.(D) RT-PCR of ta-siRNAs pptA013298 (from PpTAS3) and pptA079444 (from PpTAS1).(E) Semiquantitative RT-PCR of miRNA targets in the WT and ΔPpDCL1a.

Levels of miR156, 160, and 166 were drastically reduced and miR390 was undetectable in ΔPpDCL1a (Figure 1C). In P. patens, ta-siRNA precursors (PpTAS1–4 RNAs) are cleaved at two distinct miR390 target sites. Subsequently, dsRNAs are generated and processed in a phased manner to generate ta-siRNAs (Axtell et al., 2006Axtell M.J. Jan C. Rajagopalan R. Bartel D.P.

To test whether reduced miRNAs levels result in elevated levels of target mRNAs, as described for A. thaliana dcl1 mutants, we analyzed miR156 target PpSBP3 (Arazi et al., 2005Arazi T.

All target RNAs accumulated to higher levels in ΔPpDCL1a (Figure 1E), revealing that PpDCL1a is the major P. patens DCL protein for miRNA biogenesis and thus the functional equivalent of AtDCL1. To test possible redundancies between the two DCL1 homologs in moss, we additionally generated four PpDCL1b null mutants (ΔPpDCL1b) (Figure S2). These were affected in cell division, growth polarity, cell size, cell shape, and differentiation (Figure 2A and Figure S3A). In contrast to ΔPpDCL1a, ΔPpDCL1b grew faster and developed some malformed leafy stems (Figure 2B and Figure S3B). Thus, albeit ΔPpDCL1a and ΔPpDCL1b exhibited severe defects, their phenotypes differed (Figures S2G and S2H).Figure S3Phenotypic Analysis of ΔPpDCL1b Mutants, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Regeneration of protoplasts from wild-type plants (WT) and ΔPpDCL1b mutants was monitored at the indicated time points.

Subsequently, cleavage of the miRNA targets PpARF, PpC3HDZIP1, PpHB10, and PpSBP3 in the WT was verified by 5′ RACE, complementary DNA (cDNA) cloning, and sequencing (Figure 3A). An mRNA (PpGNT1) (Koprivova et al., 2003Koprivova A. Altmann F. Gorr G. Kopriva S. Reski R. Decker E.L.

Although ΔPpDCL1b accumulated normal levels of miRNAs, miRNA targets were not cleaved (Figure 3A), revealing a surprising requirement of PpDCL1b for miRNA-guided RNA cleavage. In the WT, we detected 5′ RACE products resulting from miRNA-guided cleavage of target RNA, as well as various shorter and longer products (Figure 3A).

Subsequently, dsRNAs may be processed into secondary siRNAs that spread the initial trigger (Figure 3B). In seed plants, this phenomenon, known as transitivity, was rarely observed in miRNA-based regulation of gene expression (Axtell et al., 2006Axtell M.J. Jan C. Rajagopalan R. Bartel D.P.

Samanta M.P. Köksal F. Janda J. Galbraith D.W. Richardson C.R. Ou-Yang F. Rock C.D. Evidence for antisense transcription associated with microRNA target mRNAs in Arabidopsis.PLoS Genet. 2009; 5: e1000457Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In accordance with possible transitivity in P. patens, we could synthesize cDNAs from sense and antisense strands of miRNA target mRNAs (PpARF and PpC3HDZIP1), indicating the presence of dsRNA, in the WT but not in ΔPpDCL1b (Figure 3C). To determine whether transitive siRNAs were generated from these dsRNAs, we performed RNA blots with probes for sequences upstream and downstream of the miRNA targeting site. Small RNAs corresponding to sense and antisense strands of PpARF and PpC3HDZIP1 mRNAs were present in the WT but not in ΔPpDCL1b (Figure 3D and Figure S4). Thus, in P. patens, transitive siRNAs arise from regions upstream as well as downstream of the miRNA targeting motif after cleavage of mRNAs. These siRNAs most likely target mRNAs at additional sites, thus generating the additional fragments observed by 5′ RACE. We did neither detect siRNAs in ΔPpDCL1b or for a control mRNA (PpGNT1) in the WT (Figures 3C and 3D), revealing that generation of transitive siRNAs depends on PpDCL1b and is specific for RNAs subject to miRNA-directed cleavage. Biogenesis of these transitive siRNAs involves RdRP-dependent formation of dsRNA precursors as we could synthesize cDNA from the antisense strand of miRNA target transcripts (Figure 3C) and detected transitive siRNAs in sense and antisense orientation (Figure 3D). Thus, biogenesis of transitive siRNAs in P. patens differs from biogenesis of secondary siRNAs in C. elegans, as these occur in antisense polarity only because of unprimed de novo synthesis by RdRP (Pak and Fire, 2007Pak J. Fire A. Distinct populations of primary and secondary effectors during RNAi in C. elegans.Science. 2007; 315: 241-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, Sijen et al., 2007Sijen T.

A. thaliana ago1 and dcl1 mutants are defective in miRNA-directed cleavage or miRNA biogenesis, respectively, and thus overaccumulate miRNA target transcripts (Ronemus et al., 2006Ronemus M. Vaughn M.W. Martienssen R.A.

Conversely, in ΔPpDCL1b, all miRNA targets analyzed had reduced levels (Figure 4A and Figure S5A), although transcripts were not cleaved. These unexpected findings hint at an epigenetic control of genes encoding miRNA targets. Since methylation of cytosine residues is associated with transcriptional silencing in eukaryotes (Bender, 2004Bender J. Chromatin-based silencing mechanisms.Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2004; 7: 521-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), we performed methylation-specific PCR from five loci, four encoding miRNA targets and one encoding PpGNT1 (Figures 4B–4E, Figure S5B, and Figure S6A–S6E). Promoters of the five genes were unmethylated in the WT, whereas in ΔPpDCL1b the four promoters of miRNA targets were methylated, but not the promoter of PpGNT1 (Figure 4C). This was confirmed by sequencing the PCR products from the PpARF promoter, demonstrating no methylation in the WT and methylation of CpG residues in ΔPpDCL1b (Figure S6A). Taken together, our experiments show that targeted disruption of the PpDCL1b gene led to loss of miRNA-directed mRNA cleavage accompanied by specific epigenetic changes in genes encoding miRNA targets.Figure S5Expression Analysis and Gene Models of PpARF, PpC3HDZIP1, PpHB10, PpSBP3 and PpGNT1, Related to Figure 4Show full caption(A) Expression analysis of miRNA target genes by quantitative real time PCR in wild-type (WT) and two ΔPpDCL1b mutant lines.

PcG-mediated repression is conserved in metazoans and is targeted in Drosophila by Polycomb response elements (PREs). However, targeting sequences in humans have not been described. While analyzing chromatin architecture in the context of human embryonic stem cell (hESC) differentiation, we discovered a 1.8kb region between HOXD11 and HOXD12 (D11.12) that is associated with PcG proteins, becomes nuclease hypersensitive, and then shows alteration in nuclease sensitivity as hESCs differentiate. The D11.12 element repressed luciferase expression from a reporter construct and full repression required a highly conserved region and YY1 binding sites. Furthermore, repression was dependent on the PcG proteins BMI1 and EED and a YY1-interacting partner, RYBP. We conclude that D11.12 is a Polycomb-dependent regulatory region with similarities to Drosophila PREs, indicating conservation in the mechanisms that target PcG function in mammals and flies."

Just how Aire targets and induces PTA transcripts remains largely undefined. Screening via Aire-targeted coimmunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry, and validating by multiple RNAi-mediated knockdown approaches, we identified a large set of proteins that associate with Aire. They fall into four major functional classes: nuclear transport, chromatin binding/structure, transcription and pre-mRNA processing. One set of Aire interactions centered on DNA protein kinase and a group of proteins it partners with to resolve DNA double-stranded breaks or promote transcriptional elongation. Another set of interactions was focused on the pre-mRNA splicing and maturation machinery, potentially explaining the markedly more effective processing of PTA transcripts in the presence of Aire. These findings suggest a model to explain Aire's widespread targeting and induction of weakly transcribed chromatin regions.PaperClip/cms/asset/1a0c2c75-4925-45f9-99ae-da1d2eade47b/mmc1.mp3Loading ...(mp3, 2.74 MB) Download audio"
https://openalex.org/W2049048085,"Background The microRNA-200 family participates in the maintenance of an epithelial phenotype and loss of its expression can result in epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). Furthermore, the loss of expression of miR-200 family members is linked to an aggressive cancer phenotype. Regulation of the miR-200 family expression in normal and cancer cells is not fully understood. Methodology/Principal Findings Epigenetic mechanisms participate in the control of miR-200c and miR-141 expression in both normal and cancer cells. A CpG island near the predicted mir-200c/mir-141 transcription start site shows a striking correlation between miR-200c and miR-141 expression and DNA methylation in both normal and cancer cells, as determined by MassARRAY technology. The CpG island is unmethylated in human miR-200/miR-141 expressing epithelial cells and in miR-200c/miR-141 positive tumor cells. The CpG island is heavily methylated in human miR-200c/miR-141 negative fibroblasts and miR-200c/miR-141 negative tumor cells. Mouse cells show a similar inverse correlation between DNA methylation and miR-200c expression. Enrichment of permissive histone modifications, H3 acetylation and H3K4 trimethylation, is seen in normal miR-200c/miR-141-positive epithelial cells, as determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to real-time PCR. In contrast, repressive H3K9 dimethylation marks are present in normal miR-200c/miR-141-negative fibroblasts and miR-200c/miR-141 negative cancer cells and the permissive histone modifications are absent. The epigenetic modifier drug, 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine, reactivates miR-200c/miR-141 expression showing that epigenetic mechanisms play a functional role in their transcriptional control. Conclusions/Significance We report that DNA methylation plays a role in the normal cell type-specific expression of miR-200c and miR-141 and this role appears evolutionarily conserved, since similar results were obtained in mouse. Aberrant DNA methylation of the miR-200c/141 CpG island is closely linked to their inappropriate silencing in cancer cells. Since the miR-200c cluster plays a significant role in EMT, our results suggest an important role for DNA methylation in the control of phenotypic conversions in normal cells."

https://openalex.org/W2125108766,"Maximizing the production of a desired small molecule is one of the primary goals in metabolic engineering. Recent advances in the nascent field of synthetic biology have increased the predictability of small-molecule production in engineered cells growing under constant conditions. The next frontier is to create synthetic pathways that adapt to changing environments. Maximizing the production of a desired small molecule is one of the primary goals in metabolic engineering. Recent advances in the nascent field of synthetic biology have increased the predictability of small-molecule production in engineered cells growing under constant conditions. The next frontier is to create synthetic pathways that adapt to changing environments. Metabolic engineering is the genetic manipulation of intracellular, enzyme-catalyzed, chemical reactions for the production of a desired molecule. For relatively simple products that require few gene manipulations to effect their production, natural or slightly modified control systems (such as promoters or ribosome-binding sites) have been widely used to control the expression of heterologous pathways or deregulate native genes. Most of these non-native controllers are static; that is, the level of gene expression is set without sensing changes in pathway output or cellular environment. Generally, these systems are optimized only for a particular environment and any deviations away from that set of conditions are likely to result in suboptimal productivity. Metabolic engineering is being called upon to tackle increasingly demanding challenges, like the production of complicated pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals that require very long metabolic pathways or the convergence of multiple heterologous pathways. For example, the pathway from acetyl-CoA to β-carotene has been implemented with 12 enzymatic steps, and the production of the anti-malaria drug precursor artemisinic acid from acetyl-CoA uses 10 enzymatic steps (Yoon et al., 2009Yoon S. Lee S. Das A. Ryu H. Jang H. Kim J. Oh D. Keasling J.D. Kim S. J. Biotechnol. 2009; 140: 218-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, Ro et al., 2006Ro D. Paradise E.M. Ouellet M. Fisher K.J. Newman K.L. Ndungu J.M. Ho K.A. Eachus R.A. Ham T.S. Kirby J. et al.Nature. 2006; 440: 940-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (1978) Google Scholar). As heterologous pathways become larger and more complicated, optimizing them becomes increasingly difficult such that piecewise optimizations, where a subset of the pathway is optimized at a time, are utilized (Martin et al., 2003Martin V.J.J. Pitera D.J. Withers S.T. Newman J.D. Keasling J.D. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 796-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar). Because segments of pathways are not independent, performing pathway optimization in sections and then combining the sections together can result in the final state of the cell being different from its state during the earlier optimizations. The ability to sense the output of each pathway segment and control of the levels of expression of pathway enzymes (or activities of pathway enzymes) would allow each pathway segment to optimize itself relative to the other pathway segments and the cell's native metabolism. Another difficult, and timely, challenge in metabolic engineering is the production of molecules with a low profit margin (such as commodity chemicals and fuels), where the need to maximize yield and productivity are essential for economic viability (Zhang et al., 2008Zhang K. Sawaya M.R. Eisenberg D.S. Liao J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 20653-20658Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, Nakamura and Whited, 2003Nakamura C.E. Whited G.M. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2003; 14: 454-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). The ability to sense critical metabolic intermediates and control levels of pathway gene expression could eliminate pathway bottlenecks or the accumulation of potentially toxic intermediates. Most of these molecules are produced by cells grown in large bioreactors where heterogeneities in the nutrient concentrations, oxygen levels, or pH are often the norm and markedly different from the conditions under which the strains were originally constructed and optimized (that is, in the uniform environment of the shaker flask or small fermenter) (Amanullah et al., 2004Amanullah A. Buckland B.C. Nienow A.W. Mixing in the fermentation and cell culture industries. Handbook of Industrial Mixing: Science and Practice. John Wiley & Sons, New York2004Google Scholar, Schmidt, 2005Schmidt F.R. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2005; 68: 425-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In applications such as these, the ability to sense the environment in which a particular cell finds itself and respond could vastly improve production by the entire culture. Additional improvements in yield or productivity could be achieved if the pathway has the capacity to monitor and respond to the cell's growth phase and density. In contrast to the static control engineered into most heterologous pathways, native metabolic pathways generally utilize dynamic regulatory networks to compensate for changing conditions by altering fluxes. That is, the turnover rate of molecules by an enzyme is altered, often by allosteric inhibition or by a negative feedback loop regulating expression of the enzyme. As the environment outside the cell changes (such as a change in nutrient availability or pH), the cell modulates its metabolic pathways dynamically to adjust fluxes so that required metabolic intermediates are delivered at the appropriate levels and times to optimize growth. Coupling sensory inputs with control devices allows for pathways to be dynamically controlled so that resources can be more efficiently utilized and productivity gains realized. By sensing cellular conditions and adjusting fluxes in a feedback loop, the engineered cell can remain near the optimal productivity that corresponds to each set of conditions encountered. The lack of dynamic controls in metabolic engineering is due in part to the complexity of designing and implementing pathways that both sense the environment and control the formation of product. Dynamic controls have the added requirements of a sensing component, a method of modulating flux, and a connection between those two elements. An additional complexity of dynamic control is the requirement for more parameters to determine transient behavior than would be required for static behavior. Thus, the benefits of dynamic control may not be perceived to outweigh the additional time and money required for implementation and testing. The predisposition against working on system dynamics is a problem that extends beyond synthetic biology. The majority of molecular biology and biomedical research also focuses on steady-state conditions, and this is likely due to the increased costs and difficultly of analyzing dynamic properties. Growing interest in implementing dynamic controls will result in the development of new experimental and computational procedures. These new techniques could lead to a synergy between synthetic biology and molecular biology that rapidly advances research on dynamic systems. Recent work on the dynamics of native metabolic pathways demonstrates how molecular biology can provide insights into how to measure and optimize their responses (Chin et al., 2008Chin C. Chubukov V. Jolly E.R. DeRisi J. Li H. PLoS Biol. 2008; 6: e146Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Although there are barriers to the adoption of dynamic controls, advances in synthetic and systems biology will continue to lower these barriers and make dynamic controls more attractive. In particular, progress in modeling, computer-aided design, quantitative gene expression, and DNA synthesis and assembly will play important roles in enabling dynamic controls. And the development of advanced biological devices (for example, logic gates, bi-stable switches, counters, and ring oscillators) has resulted in the availability of a large number of well-characterized biological components that can be used to construct dynamic controllers. Many of these devices make use of standardized parts or interfaces that simplify functional composition and allow for rapid reuse of devices in new contexts. Hopefully these community-driven standards will result in a lowering of the costs involved in building complex systems. Not only will these well-characterized and standardized components aid the development of dynamic controls, they will also further static control systems, which are likely to be used extensively for controlling metabolic pathways long into the future. Static controllers of flux are genetically encoded components that play a role in determining the level of flux through a pathway but do not sense cellular conditions and modulate the pathway flux based on the sensed information. There are many parameters that can be used to change the static control of a particular flux. Examples of such parameters are strength and type of constitutive promoter, ribosome binding site strength, or copy number of the vector. There is a vast literature on promoters and transcription initiation. However, much of the application of promoters in metabolic engineering involves the use of natural or slightly modified, inducible promoters or constitutive promoters of different strengths. Precise quantitative data on promoter activities from relevant culture conditions are required for predicting gene expression levels to alter flux. Recently, there has been an effort to standardize a technique for measuring relative promoter strengths (Kelly et al., 2009Kelly J. Rubin A. Davis J. Ajo-Franklin C. Cumbers J. Czar M. de Mora K. Glieberman A. Monie D. Endy D. J. Biol. Eng. 2009; 3: 4Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). In this method, the fluorescence level from green fluorescent protein from a standard reference plasmid is compared to a plasmid with only the promoter changed. The ratio of the two expression levels is expected to remain constant if the measurements are repeated with a different host strain or growth condition. Therefore, if the fluorescence from the standard plasmid is measured under a unique set of conditions, then the transcription rate can be predicted for any promoter that has been previously measured in another context along with the reference promoter. One major challenge in specifying the level of gene expression is designing the appropriate levels of translation. In native systems, the folding of mRNA near the ribosome-binding site (RBS) can strongly contribute to the gene expression level. Because the portion of the mRNA containing the RBS can interact with the gene-coding region, it is not trivial to predict how an RBS-gene pair will express based on their individual behavior in other contexts. The energetics of translation initiation in prokaryotes has been extensively studied. However, many of the existing models have an unacceptable failure rate or are difficult to use when designing systems. A thermodynamic model of translation initiation has been developed by Salis et al., 2009Salis H.M. Mirsky E.A. Voigt C.A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2009; 27: 946-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar to predict the relative level of translation initiation for a given mRNA. Using the nucleotide sequence of a gene and a relative translation initiation rate, the algorithm generates a corresponding RBS sequence that when incorporated into the construct will provide the desired level of gene expression. Use of such a tool reduces the unintentional introduction of inhibitory RNA secondary structures and allows for levels of gene expression to be easily and predictably adjusted. Another method of achieving predictable translation levels is to use bicistronic operons, which have long been employed to ensure high levels of expression from arbitrary genes (Schoner et al., 1986Schoner B.E. Belagaje R.M. Schoner R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1986; 83: 8506-8510Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The existence of mRNA secondary structure between the second RBS and downstream gene does not cause translational inhibition, and therefore the translation initiation of the second gene is independent of its coding sequence (Kimura et al., 2005Kimura S. Umemura T. Iyanagi T. J. Biochem. 2005; 137: 523-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The first gene can be a truncated protein that only exists to affect the translation of the second gene. Use of synthetic bicistronic systems has been limited to achieving high protein levels. However, there is the potential to create libraries of bicistronic static controllers of flux that cover a broad range of translation initiation rates. It has not yet been demonstrated that bicistronic constructs can give predictable and precise expression of the second gene; however they are likely to outperform pairings of genes with independently characterized RBSs. Increasing enzyme expression levels is an easy route to achieving high fluxes with static controls; however, other methods may make more efficient use of cellular resources. By localizing tagged pathway enzymes to a scaffold using protein-protein interaction domains, Dueber et al., 2009Dueber J.E. Wu G.C. Malmirchegini G.R. Moon T.S. Petzold C.J. Ullal A.V. Prather K.J. Keasling J.D. Nat. Biotechnol. 2009; 27: 753-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar have been able to increase the flux 77-fold through a biosynthetic pathway for mevalonate in the bacterium Escherichia coli. They use an engineered scaffold, containing mouse and rat protein-protein interaction domains, to increase the local concentration of the enzymes and prevent the accumulation of pathway intermediates that may be harmful to the cells. Ideally, one would use a model to specify the gene expression levels needed to achieve the desired flux in any one particular reaction. The existence of genome-scale metabolic models has lead to the development of new computational algorithms for improving production strains. Microbes appear to maximize their formation of biomass, which often does not lead to high yields of the desired product. By altering or eliminating expression levels of native genes it is possible to improve a strain's yield or productivity. However, the number of possible combinatorial changes is too large to test in vivo and therefore in silico methods are used to predict the best set of modifications. These predictions are generally made using flux balance analysis, which makes an assumption of steady-state conditions in order to reduce computational complexity (Llaneras and Picó, 2008Llaneras F. Picó J. J. Biosci. Bioeng. 2008; 105: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Because flux balance analysis does not incorporate any regulatory information, these methods can only suggest changes to expression levels of catalytic enzymes but not to regulatory genes. Another drawback of flux balance analysis is the absence of any kinetic information. Despite these short-comings, flux balance analysis has proven to be a useful tool for choosing where to implement static controllers of flux. Several algorithms have been published for determining targets for altered expression levels. To simplify calculations some methods only determine genes to be knocked out. The OptKnock framework uses linear programming techniques to efficiently find combinations of knockout candidates (Burgard et al., 2003Burgard A.P. Pharkya P. Maranas C.D. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2003; 84: 647-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). OptReg, an extension of the OptKnock framework, can select genes that should be expressed at higher levels, lower levels, or not at all (Pharkya and Maranas, 2006Pharkya P. Maranas C.D. Metab. Eng. 2006; 8: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). An alternative iterative search methodology was used by Alper et al., 2005aAlper H. Jin Y. Moxley J. Stephanopoulos G. Metab. Eng. 2005; 7: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar for optimizing lycopene biosynthesis in E. coli. They first identified advantageous single knockouts and then additional knockouts were introduced in the single knockout strains, which were then tested for lycopene production. Strains with single, double, and triple knockouts were created and tested in vivo (Alper et al., 2005aAlper H. Jin Y. Moxley J. Stephanopoulos G. Metab. Eng. 2005; 7: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). For most strains they find good agreement between in silico and in vivo results. To explore the limits of flux balance analysis, Alper et al. performed a global transposon search, which found new knockout targets, and used a convenient screening method based on colony color to rapidly locate the advantageous knockouts. Although the transposon knockouts were able to improve production, they did not exceed the production of the best strain from flux balance analysis, nor did the combination of both knockout pools result in a new maximum level of lycopene production (Alper et al., 2005bAlper H. Miyaoku K. Stephanopoulos G. Nat. Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 612-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). This illustrates that developing in silico methods for determining which regulatory genes are good targets for knockouts or modification of expression level is an open area of research. Dynamic control is a common feature of native metabolic pathways, and allosteric regulation is an important mechanism to maintain flux or limit accumulation of a metabolic intermediate through the pathway in the face of changing conditions. In general, the first enzyme or a key branchpoint of a pathway is downregulated by the pathway's product. For example, the first enzyme in E. coli's serine biosynthesis pathway, D-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (SerA), is allosterically inhibited by serine (Grant et al., 1996Grant G.A. Schuller D.J. Banaszak L.J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 34-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). There are few published examples of engineered dynamic control of fluxes in heterologous pathways. However, these systems will become increasingly common as engineered networks become more predictable (Figure 1). Farmer and Liao, 2000Farmer W.R. Liao J.C. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 533-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar were the first to demonstrate that engineering dynamic control of fluxes could improve yield and productivity of a heterologous pathway. Excess glucose flux and the diversion of carbon to acetate formation reduce the productivity of lycopene-generating E. coli cultures. An acetyl phosphate-activated transcription factor and promoter were used as a sensor of excess glucose flux. When acetyl phosphate accumulates inside the cell and is detected by the engineered system, transcription of two genes regulated by the engineered system (pps and idi) are upregulated, which diverts flux from acetate production to lycopene. The strain with dynamic control of pps and idi produces titers of lycopene that are 18-fold higher (and comparable improvement to productivity) than those from a strain with constitutive control of the genes. Growing cultures to an intermediate or high density before inducing product formation is a common practice because it can greatly improve productivity. However using inducer adds cost and potential regulatory hurdles. An alternative is to engineer microbes to sense their own density and activate gene expression at the appropriate time (Kobayashi et al., 2004Kobayashi H. Kærn M. Araki M. Chung K. Gardner T.S. Cantor C.R. Collins J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 8414-8419Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). By linking a genetic toggle switch to a synthetic quorum sensing system based on the lux system from Vibrio fischeri, cells activate gene expression when they reach a threshold density (Kobayashi et al., 2004Kobayashi H. Kærn M. Araki M. Chung K. Gardner T.S. Cantor C.R. Collins J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 8414-8419Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). At low cell densities the protein of interest is not detectable, at intermediate densities there is a bimodal distribution with the majority of cells not expressing the protein, and at high densities all the cells express the protein. Although this system has been used in the context of protein production, it could easily be applied to metabolic engineering to upregulate an enzyme or pathway. More recently, Gadkar et al., 2005Gadkar K.G. Doyle III, F.J. Edwards J.S. Mahadevan R. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2005; 89: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar have shown that it is possible to use metabolic flux analysis to predict improvements in product formation resulting from dynamic pathway control. Using a metabolic model of a glycerol-producing strain of E. coli, the optimal induction time for the glycerol kinase gene, glpK, was determined so that growth is maximized in one phase and production maximized in the other phase. Introducing this level of dynamic control of enzyme expression increased biomass, leading to higher glycerol productivity. The same modeling framework has also been applied to ethanol production by an E. coli strain deficient in the lactate biosynthetic enzyme lactate dehydrogenase and expressing a heterologous pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase (Gadkar et al., 2005Gadkar K.G. Doyle III, F.J. Edwards J.S. Mahadevan R. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2005; 89: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Knocking out the gene encoding acetate kinase, ackA, is known to drastically decrease the growth rate but increase the flux of carbon to ethanol production. The authors compared an ackA knockout to the repression of ackA expression at an optimal time during the process. The general results are similar to those revealed for glycerol production; a higher initial growth rate allows the culture with a modulated ackA to have an increased productivity in experiments of limited duration. This work provides a mathematical framework for dynamically controlling fluxes and demonstrates the advantages of doing so. Anesiadis et al., 2008Anesiadis N. Cluett W.R. Mahadevan R. Metab. Eng. 2008; 10: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar assessed in silico the ability of the dynamic controller devised by Kobayashi et al., 2004Kobayashi H. Kærn M. Araki M. Chung K. Gardner T.S. Cantor C.R. Collins J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 8414-8419Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar to modulate fluxes in strains engineered to produce ethanol or succinate. In all cases, Anesiadis et al. had the dynamic controller repress expression of one or more genes when cell density reached a threshold. The affinity between LuxR (a quorum sensing transcriptional activator) and its ligand acyl-homoserine lactone is used to tune the threshold cell density. The modulated genes were in competing pathways or consumed an upstream metabolite. With an in silico genome-scale model of E. coli, the authors demonstrate that a self-regulating biphasic culture could be obtained and that such a culture could result in increased productivity. The literature on dynamic control that we have presented provides examples of added layers of regulation that could be integrated with existing heterologous pathways to turn on or off genes at certain stages of the culture. This is a powerful paradigm and for the near term will likely constitute the majority of research on dynamic controls. However there are other ways of applying dynamic controls to metabolic engineering that have not yet been demonstrated. Mimicking allosteric regulation is difficult to implement for an arbitrary product, in part because protein engineering is not yet sophisticated enough to perform such a task. However it would be easier to implement a feedback loop that modulates the expression level of an upstream enzyme. An engineered aptazyme (a fusion of an aptamer and ribozyme to form an allosteric catalytic RNA) could be used to sense product and accordingly inhibit translation of an enzyme in its metabolic pathway. Alternatively, the dynamic control could forgo sensing the product and simply attempt to maintain an enzyme at a constant concentration by creating a fusion between the enzyme and a transcriptional inhibitor so that the enzyme autoregulates its own transcription. Such a feedback loop could reduce the noise present in gene expression to give a more constant level of enzyme (Becskei and Serrano, 2000Becskei A. Serrano L. Nature. 2000; 405: 590-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar). One opportunity is to engineer dynamic controls that will respond to cell heterogeneities and “dead zones” present in large-scale industrial cultures. Through scale up, it can be difficult to maintain a homogeneous culture in part due to gradients of carbon source, O2, pH, or CO2 in large fermentation vessels (Amanullah et al., 2004Amanullah A. Buckland B.C. Nienow A.W. Mixing in the fermentation and cell culture industries. Handbook of Industrial Mixing: Science and Practice. John Wiley & Sons, New York2004Google Scholar). Strains with only static control of flux through the heterologous pathway cannot be optimized for production in all of these different environments. By using dynamic controls it may be possible to partially rescue the productivity of cells while they are in the undermixed regions of the bioreactor. This is a challenging proposition because time constants of the dynamic controls will need to be less than the circulation time of cells in the bioreactor. One final application for dynamic controls is to enable piecewise optimization of a large pathway. If a strain is designed and optimized to produce a common precursor, then later work to add more genes downstream has the potential to interact with the upstream portion of the pathway and perturb it away from the optimal flux. A system that could sense and respond to the change in flux would allow downstream engineering to proceed with less concern about how additions to the strain might negate previous work. Synthetic biology has the potential to reshape how heterologous pathways are designed and controlled. Static controls for synthetic pathways are becoming more predictable, and in combination with advances in DNA synthesis, new levels of complexity in pathway design are now feasible. This additional complexity can enable new, longer pathways or can be used to add dynamic controls that can increase productivity and make strains more robust to changing conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2007701229,"Next-generation sequencing technologies promise to dramatically accelerate the use of genetic information for crop improvement by facilitating the genetic mapping of agriculturally important phenotypes. The first step in optimizing the design of genetic mapping studies involves large-scale polymorphism discovery and a subsequent genome-wide assessment of the population structure and pattern of linkage disequilibrium (LD) in the species of interest. In the present study, we provide such an assessment for the grapevine (genus Vitis), the world's most economically important fruit crop. Reduced representation libraries (RRLs) from 17 grape DNA samples (10 cultivated V. vinifera and 7 wild Vitis species) were sequenced with sequencing-by-synthesis technology. We developed heuristic approaches for SNP calling, identified hundreds of thousands of SNPs and validated a subset of these SNPs on a 9K genotyping array. We demonstrate that the 9K SNP array provides sufficient resolution to distinguish among V. vinifera cultivars, between V. vinifera and wild Vitis species, and even among diverse wild Vitis species. We show that there is substantial sharing of polymorphism between V. vinifera and wild Vitis species and find that genetic relationships among V. vinifera cultivars agree well with their proposed geographic origins using principal components analysis (PCA). Levels of LD in the domesticated grapevine are low even at short ranges, but LD persists above background levels to 3 kb. While genotyping arrays are useful for assessing population structure and the decay of LD across large numbers of samples, we suggest that whole-genome sequencing will become the genotyping method of choice for genome-wide genetic mapping studies in high-diversity plant species. This study demonstrates that we can move quickly towards genome-wide studies of crop species using next-generation sequencing. Our study sets the stage for future work in other high diversity crop species, and provides a significant enhancement to current genetic resources available to the grapevine genetic community."
https://openalex.org/W2059786834,"The induction of a protracted response to a brief stimulus is a form of cellular memory. Here we describe the role of transcriptional regulation in both natural and synthetic memory networks and discuss the potential applications of engineered memory networks in medicine and industrial biotechnology. The induction of a protracted response to a brief stimulus is a form of cellular memory. Here we describe the role of transcriptional regulation in both natural and synthetic memory networks and discuss the potential applications of engineered memory networks in medicine and industrial biotechnology. Biological memory can be defined as a sustained cellular response to a transient stimulus. To understand this phenomenon, we must consider how the properties of different biological systems achieve memory of a stimulus, essentially permitting a cell to produce a lasting response. One way that cells accomplish this task is through transcriptional states, which involve populations of molecules regulating gene expression. If the transcriptional response is bistable, a chemical state becomes defined as on or off and, given certain parameters, this state can be inherited through DNA replication and cell division. In this way, a cell can produce a lasting memory of a biological response. Synthetic biologists are especially interested in transcriptional responses as a means of cellular memory because (1) much of a cell's information processing is performed through transcription, and (2) the basic machinery for such biological behavior is well-understood. As such, transcription provides us with a set of characterized genetic units, including promoters, activators, and repressors that can be recombined to create new transcriptional circuits. Furthermore, the way nature combines these biological parts to produce specific outputs, including cellular memory, has been extensively studied. Thus, we have at our fingertips the tools with which to design synthetic memory systems. The construction of synthetic memory circuits will improve our understanding of natural networks, further aiding the creation of useful, new biological tools. For example, a device capable of remembering a biological experience might be utilized in the long-term study of particular cells within a heterogeneous population following a defined event or applied in industry for the sustained production of desired proteins after induction by a brief stimulus. Such bioengineered networks exemplify a primary objective of synthetic biology: to advance simple synthetic devices into expertly constructed circuits with important applications. Nearly 50 years ago, François Jacob and Jacques Monod determined qualitatively how a cell might achieve biological memory through its transcriptional circuitry (Monod and Jacob, 1961Monod J. Jacob F. Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1961; 26: 389-401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, a quantitative understanding of these circuits has been achieved only recently (Alon, 2006Alon U. An Introduction to Systems Biology: Design Principles of Biological Circuits. Chapman & Hall/CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL2006Crossref Google Scholar). Synthetic biology bridges the gap between biology and mathematics, requiring our understanding of cellular memory to encompass more than half a century of scientific work. Here, we will briefly address the concepts that are fundamental to the achievement of biological memory through transcription. Cells must sense and dynamically respond to both internal and external signals. This often requires the synthesis or modification of transcription factors, which form an interaction network whose design determines the speed and sustainability of protein output in response to an environmental input (Monod and Jacob, 1961Monod J. Jacob F. Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1961; 26: 389-401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Alon, 2006Alon U. An Introduction to Systems Biology: Design Principles of Biological Circuits. Chapman & Hall/CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL2006Crossref Google Scholar). Depending on whether transcription factor X is an activator or repressor, the concentration of gene product Y increases or decreases from a basal level as a function of the concentration of X binding to Y's promoter [f(X)]. The production of Y is further balanced by Y's degradation and dilution rates (defined as α, with units of 1/time):Y=s+f(X)−α·f(X)(1) To more thoroughly understand how a transcriptional input produces specific gene outputs, one can use the Hill function in the above equation to define and describe the equilibrium binding of a transcription factor to its target promoter (Alon, 2006Alon U. An Introduction to Systems Biology: Design Principles of Biological Circuits. Chapman & Hall/CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL2006Crossref Google Scholar). Although a Hill function for a transactivating transcription factor (Equation 2) varies slightly from that of a transrepressor (Equation 3), the components of each are similar (Figure 1A ):Y=s+βXnKn+Xn−α·f(X)(2) Y=s+β1+(XK)n−α·f(X)(3) There are three key parameters: K, β, and n. K is the activation/repression coefficient, defining the concentration of X needed to reach the threshold for activation or repression of Y; K's value is largely related to the chemical affinity between X and its binding site on Y's promoter (Alon, 2006Alon U. An Introduction to Systems Biology: Design Principles of Biological Circuits. Chapman & Hall/CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL2006Crossref Google Scholar). The term β defines the maximal expression level from Y's promoter (in units of mRNAs/time), obtained when an activator is bound or a repressor is unbound. The most pertinent parameter is n, the Hill coefficient. This value governs how a network responds to transcriptional input: a smaller n (n = 1) results in a more graded response, whereas a larger n (n = 4) produces a bistable, switch-like response (Figure 1A). The latter behavior is essential to biological memory because a bistable response allows a system to shift to an alternative steady state that might persist over time. To achieve a sufficiently high Hill coefficient, biological systems employ a number of mechanisms. First, there must be nonlinearity within a transcriptional circuit, meaning a functional element that guarantees that a threshold-like response to a stimulus is required (Ninfa and Mayo, 2004Ninfa A.J. Mayo A.E. Sci. STKE. 2004; 232: pe20Google Scholar). This effect can be achieved through the affinity, cooperativity, or multimerization of transcription factors at their binding sites within target gene promoters. Transcription factors vary widely in their degrees of cooperativity and affinity for their binding sites, and the degree of binding can also differ depending on the number of binding sites present in a given promoter. These factors help to ensure a lasting response to a transient stimulus and are especially effective at reducing stochastic fluctuation between steady states, an undesirable behavior in a transcriptional circuit designed to produce a lasting response. Another requirement for attaining a large Hill coefficient is that the genetic elements we have touched upon thus far must be arranged in specific motifs that permit bistable responses (Monod and Jacob, 1961Monod J. Jacob F. Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1961; 26: 389-401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To achieve this goal, nature often employs transcriptional positive feedback (Ferrell, 2002Ferrell J.E. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2002; 6: 140-148Crossref Scopus (855) Google Scholar, Alon, 2006Alon U. An Introduction to Systems Biology: Design Principles of Biological Circuits. Chapman & Hall/CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL2006Crossref Google Scholar). In this network design, production of protein Y only increases once the concentration of X approaches the expression threshold for Y's promoter, resulting in a sigmoidal response curve (Demongeot et al., 2000Demongeot J. Kaufman M. Thomas R. C. R. Acad. Sci. III. 2000; 323: 69-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Positive feedback can be produced by either a single transcription factor self-activating in response to a stimulus (positive autofeedback) or two transcription factors regulating each other through two positive or negative interactions (double-positive/double-negative feedback) (Figure 1B). When protein concentrations reach certain thresholds, all three motifs result in a switch between two steady states. If the switch is sharp enough, a gene can become locked into an alternate steady state, even in the absence of the original inducer (Ferrell, 2002Ferrell J.E. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2002; 6: 140-148Crossref Scopus (855) Google Scholar). Finally, to achieve the desired Hill coefficient, it is important to remember that transcription-based memory is derived from proteins that are degraded at some natural rate and diluted through cell growth. If the rates of degradation and dilution are faster than protein production rates, levels of transcription factor X may not be sufficiently high to achieve or maintain the desired bistable output. As this would result in a failure to achieve memory once the initial stimulus is removed, it is a critical parameter for the bioengineer to keep in mind. Many natural examples of biological memory have been discovered to possess feedback, bistability, and cooperativity. We will highlight some of this work and include examples that are not strictly transcription based but nonetheless employ parallel mechanisms. These natural systems inform the design of synthetic memory circuits, and the diversity of mechanisms highlights the general importance of this biological phenomenon. Some of the earliest work in molecular genetics elucidated the role of bistable networks in the regulatory system of the phage lambda, the lac operon, and the cell cycle. For example, Eisen et al., 1970Eisen H. Brachet P. Pereira da Silva L. Jacob F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1970; 66: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar described a multiply mutated lambda lysogen in which the toxic functions of the phage were eliminated, leaving only the regulatory essence of lambda's two-state system; considering that this was prior to the use of restriction enzymes in genetic constructions, this work arguably represents an early example of synthetic biology limited by the technology available at that time. The phage lambda system switches between two states based on a repression loop between the mutual antagonists lambda repressor and Cro (Ptashne, 2004Ptashne M. A Genetic Switch: Phage Lambda Revisited. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2004Google Scholar) (Figure 2A ) and involves both positive autoregulation and double-negative feedback. Likewise, in the bacterium Escherichia coli, the lac operon (required for lactose metabolism) can exist in on or off states mediated through the positive feedback loop of lactose transport (Muller-Hill, 1996Muller-Hill B. The Lac Operon: A Short History of a Genetic Paradigm. Walter de Gruyter, Berlin, Germany1996Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Work in oocyte extracts from the frog Xenopus has revealed that positive feedback loops govern cell-cycle progression by creating a bistable system wherein levels of specific proteins alternate between two steady states, determining discrete phases and forward movement through the cycle (Novak and Tyson, 1993Novak B. Tyson J.J. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 1153-1168PubMed Google Scholar, Thron, 1996Thron C.D. Biophys. Chem. 1996; 57: 239-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Positive feedback is also thought to be utilized in nucleosomal modification. The mechanism is believed to allow chromosomal regions to adopt stable and heritable states, resulting in bistable gene expression that persists through DNA replication and cell division (Dodd et al., 2007Dodd I.B. Micheelsen M.A. Sneppen K. Thon G. Cell. 2007; 129: 813-822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, Barrett and Wood, 2008Barrett R.M. Wood M.A. Learn. Mem. 2008; 15: 460-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Positive autoregulation can arise if nucleosomes carrying a specific modification recruit enzymes that catalyze similar modifications of neighboring nucleosomes, allowing a nucleosomal cluster to stably maintain itself in a particular modification state (Stefanko et al., 2009Stefanko D.P. Barrett R.M. Ly A.R. Reolon G.K. Wood M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 9447-9452Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). This phenomenon may be involved in the silencing of H3-H4 histones by methylation marks (di- or trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 9), to which heterochromatin-associated protein 1 (HP1) can bind (Vermaak et al., 2003Vermaak D. Ahmad K. Henikoff S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 266-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) (Figure 2B). It is hypothesized that histone methytransferases bound to HP1 can transmit methylation marks to adjacent, newly replicated nucleosomes, creating an epigenetic feedback loop of silenced chromatin. Given the involvement of feedback motifs in epigenetic determination, it is not at all surprising to find this mechanism further used in eukaryotic cell differentiation, a process determined by epigenetic patterning. For example, transition between two stages of Xenopus oocyte maturation is induced by progesterone. Once the progesterone has dissipated, commitment to maturation is maintained via positive feedback within a mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascade (Figure 2C). The role of positive feedback in binary cell-fate switches has been further observed in mouse and human embryonic stem (ES) cells. Genome-wide transcriptional studies have identified OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG as critical players in the circuitry responsible for cell differentiation (Boyer et al., 2005Boyer L.A. Lee T.I. Cole M.F. Johnstone S.E. Levine S.S. Zucker J.P. Guenther M.G. Kumar R.M. Murray H.L. Jenner R.G. et al.Cell. 2005; 122: 947-956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3503) Google Scholar, Loh et al., 2006Loh Y.-H. Wu Q. Chew J.-L. Vega V.B. Zhang W. Chen X. Bourque G. George J. Leong B. Liu J. et al.Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1928) Google Scholar). Dynamic modeling has revealed that these transcription factors interact via positive feedback loops, resulting in a bistable switch that regulates when and how an ES cell differentiates (Chickarmane et al., 2006Chickarmane V. Troein C. Nuber U.A. Sauro H.M. Peterson C. PLoS Comput. Biol. 2006; 2: e123Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Finally, a discussion of memory storage in the immune and nervous systems naturally arises. These systems are alike in many ways, including their capacity to manage vast quantities of information. The immune system is required to consistently recognize foreign antigens from countless sources, and each individual neuron is required to receive information from numerous synaptic connections. To file this data, each system employs mechanisms for molecular memory. One tool used by the immune system is somatic V(D)J recombination, which bistably rearranges genes in response to specific foreign antigens, permitting lymphocytes to produce the necessary proteins for mounting immune responses. This mechanism results in both an immediate immune response and a population of long-lived memory cells that can mount stronger responses if the initial pathogen is ever again detected (Muotri and Gage, 2006Muotri A.R. Gage F.H. Nature. 2006; 441: 1087-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). To handle the brain's computing load and to store information despite molecular turnover, one mechanism used by neurons might be positive feedback (Tanaka and Augustine, 2008Tanaka K. Augustine G.J. Neuron. 2008; 59: 608-620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, Ogasawara and Kawato, 2009Ogasawara H. Kawato M. Sci. Signal. 2009; 35: pe7Google Scholar). This activity may serve as a general method for perpetuating signal transduction networks in the brain, thus further establishing memory networks as remarkable biological tools (Figure 2D). Using natural memory circuits as guides, a variety of synthetic memory pathways have been engineered from transcription-based parts in bacterial, yeast, and mammalian cells. One of the first simple bistable devices was constructed in E. coli by Gardner et al., 2000Gardner T.S. Cantor C.R. Collins J.J. Nature. 2000; 403: 339-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (3138) Google Scholar. The modules consist of double-negative feedback systems using well-described prokaryotic gene repressor proteins. This device demonstrates bistability: once the switch is flipped toward one steady state, it remains there in the absence of the original stimulus, until a second stimulus shifts the system to an alternate steady state. This behavior is ensured by cooperativity in the binding of repressors to DNA and by trial-and-error testing of promoters of different strengths (Gardner et al., 2000Gardner T.S. Cantor C.R. Collins J.J. Nature. 2000; 403: 339-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (3138) Google Scholar, Xiong and Ferrell, 2003Xiong W. Ferrell Jr., J.E. Nature. 2003; 426: 460-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). The Gardner circuit was the first demonstration that bistable responses can indeed be engineered into a synthetic system. Others have extended this work by building similar networks that are more robust due to further quantitative understanding of the modular components that constitute such systems (Atkinson et al., 2003Atkinson M.R. Savageau M.A. Myers J.T. Ninfa A.J. Cell. 2003; 113: 597-607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, Isaacs et al., 2003Isaacs F.J. Hasty J. Cantor C.R. Collins J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 7714-7719Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). These preliminary memory switches allowed for the later construction of bacterial memory networks with novel functions. This was best demonstrated when Kobayashi et al., 2004Kobayashi H. Kaern M. Araki M. Chung K. Gardner T.S. Cantor C.R. Collins J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 8414-8419Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar used a lacI/lambda repressor toggle switch as a memory circuit embedded within a larger circuit based on the E. coli SOS signaling pathway, enabling the memory circuit to sense DNA damage and retain memory of this event (Kobayashi et al., 2004Kobayashi H. Kaern M. Araki M. Chung K. Gardner T.S. Cantor C.R. Collins J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 8414-8419Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). The group further constructed a strain in which biofilm formation is induced post-DNA damage, thereby demonstrating that artificial regulatory circuits can be used to produce permanent phenotypic changes. The early successes in bacteria laid the groundwork for similar projects in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Work on yeast memory modules largely began with Becskei and colleagues, who constructed a simple switch in which a tetracycline-dependent activator turns on its own synthesis (Becksei et al., 2001Becksei A. Seraphin B. Serrano L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2528-2535Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). This design permits cells to switch between on and off states in response to increasing levels of tetracycline, largely due to the inherent cooperativity of the activator and eukaryotic transcription (Becksei et al., 2001Becksei A. Seraphin B. Serrano L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2528-2535Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Ingolia and colleagues sought to determine how easily a monostable signaling pathway might become bistable by engineering positive feedback into the system (Ingolia and Murray, 2007Ingolia N.T. Murray A.W. Curr. Biol. 2007; 17: 668-677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To address this question, they chose the budding-yeast mating-pheromone response, a well-studied MAP kinase system stimulated by exogenous pheromone (Ingolia and Murray, 2007Ingolia N.T. Murray A.W. Curr. Biol. 2007; 17: 668-677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Using the natural phosphorylation cascade, the authors expressed a dominant active allele of a key pathway protein. Once triggered, the pathway can sustain itself because the dominant protein is able to feed back into the natural pathway, thereby producing a positive autoregulatory circuit. Furthermore, the tunability of the feedback loop was demonstrated via mutations that alter the basal and induced expression levels of the feedback promoter. The application of quantitative approaches to reliable circuit design is well-illustrated by the work in yeast by Ajo-Franklin et al., 2007Ajo-Franklin C.M. Drubin D.A. Eskin J.A. Gee E.P. Landgraf D. Phillips I. Silver P.A. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 2271-2276Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar. Using quantitative modeling of transcription dynamics, the authors constructed a synthetic memory circuit based on transcriptional positive feedback. The device bistably responds to a pulse of galactose by producing a transcriptional activator that induces a downstream autofeedback loop. Given certain system parameters, the loop activity persists in the absence of galactose and the inducing transactivator, such that the circuit imparts memory of galactose exposure onto cells and their progeny. Computational modeling using quantitative descriptions of various tested transactivators suggested that low basal expression coupled with switch-like activation is required to maintain memory; growth rate was also found to significantly impact memory loop protein sustainability following cell division. The design strategies and critical parameters discovered in nature and tested synthetically in bacteria and yeast have been further applied toward the engineering of mammalian cells. Of note is the toggle switch in Chinese hamster ovary cells, the design of which is largely based on the bacterial toggle switch (Kramer et al., 2004Kramer B.P. Viretta A.U. Daoud-El-Baba M. Aubel D. Weber W. Fussenegger M. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 867-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Using transrepressors dependent on streptogramin and macrolide antibiotics, the system responds in a bistable manner to specific inducers. This response allows for switch-specific expression of a human glycoprotein both in culture and mice, impressively demonstrating the possibility of epigenetic transgene control through bistable circuits. Fussenegger's group has designed a number of such modules, primarily using antibiotics to control positive or double-negative feedback networks (Kramer et al., 2003Kramer B.P. Weber W. Fussenegger M. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2003; 83: 810-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, Weber et al., 2007Weber W. Kramer B.P. Fussenegger M. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2007; 98: 894-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, Tigges et al., 2009Tigges M. Marquez-Lago T.T. Stelling J. Fussenegger M. Nature. 2009; 457: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). This work lays the groundwork for the further bioengineering of mammalian systems and their application in research and clinical settings. The synthetic circuits discussed thus far all employ transcriptional circuitry that mimics natural networks to produce biological memory. It should be noted that memory devices have also been constructed using systems based on DNA recombinases (such as Cre or Flippase-mediated recombination), which leave a permanent mark in the genome (Mortensen, 2006Mortensen R. Curr. Protoc. Mol. Biol. 2006; 23 (1.1–1.12)PubMed Google Scholar, Friedland et al., 2009Friedland A.E. Lu T.K. Wang X. Shi D. Church G. Collins J.J. Science. 2009; 324: 1199-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Although this approach is useful, there are potential problems as DNA rearrangements and recombinase expression can have undesirable consequences if not properly regulated. Additionally, transgene expression via recombination is more difficult to tune or reverse due to its permanency, allowing less flexibility for a synthetic biologist interested in exploring the design capabilities of network-based memory. Both methods are entirely valid. Each is appropriate in different situations and should be applied with careful consideration. Having observed the successful integration of nature's tools into a variety of synthetic memory devices, we might now ask, what can we do with this? The ability to construct robust, synthetic circuits enables us to engineer cells capable of recording stimulus exposure or maintaining desired levels of gene expression over time, in the absence of inducer. Advances in synthesis and new recombinant DNA technology allow the production of such devices from highly interchangeable units, permitting responses to an array of stimuli in a variety of cell types (Shetty et al., 2008Shetty R.P. Endy D. Knight Jr., T.F. J. Biol. Eng. 2008; 2: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). A modular approach to the induction of a high-fidelity memory device might allow researchers to identify cell populations responsive to specific events and track their progression through the cellular response. This would be of particular use if a device employs fluorescent markers that permit quantitative, single-cell tracking of cells within a responding population, as suggested by Ajo-Franklin et al., 2007Ajo-Franklin C.M. Drubin D.A. Eskin J.A. Gee E.P. Landgraf D. Phillips I. Silver P.A. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 2271-2276Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar. These device characteristics may address whether a response to a defined event correlates with later cell behavior. Capturing this cellular phenomenon could have great impact on the study of any disease involving the inheritance of a cellular state, such as cancer. In addition to being readouts of cellular experience, memory modules can potentially use their output as regulatory input to perform new functions. Harnessing the ability to achieve long-term maintenance of desired relative protein levels, memory circuits might precisely regulate output or rapidly alternate between multiple outputs. Along these lines, one can imagine a memory module contributing to gene therapy or the synthetic differentiation of mammalian stem cells in a certain fashion after experiencing a brief stimulus. Importantly, given the parallels to natural mechanisms of cell-based inheritance, such circuits may increase our understanding of biological processes such as cellular differentiation and tissue formation. For example, at decreased levels of activation, a positive feedback module can spontaneously switch between steady states. This can lead to variable gene expression and possibly undesired phenotypes including disease; in fact, unstable autocrine feedback loops have been linked to some cases of tumorigenesis (Schulze et al., 2001Schulze A. Lehmann K. Jefferies H.B.J. McMahon M. Downward J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 981-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). By studying the engineering of feedback loops, we may better understand how their malfunction affects biological events. Finally, memory modules are potentially useful in industrial biotechnology. The feedback loop permits sustained induction of recombinant proteins without massive quantities of inducer. Promoters that respond to a plethora of stimuli (such as specific small molecules, pH, temperature, or anaerobiosis) already exist or can be engineered, allowing for a variety of production conditions. Of course, for these ventures to be successful, certain factors will have to be considered, including the impact of induction on protein yields and how recombinant gene expression affects cell growth and physiology. If properly engineered, however, memory modules may help overcome high production costs associated with requiring large quantities of chemical inducer. The precise design and implementation of systems exhibiting complex dynamic behavior remains a major goal of synthetic biology. An educated choice of network components and their fluid assembly into constructs with predictable behavior may enable synthetic circuits to increase our understanding of biology and improve our ability to engineer cells. The potential lying within memory modules may help progress the field of synthetic biology toward a new phase of device production. This phase will ideally incorporate detailed quantitative and qualitative approaches into the creation of highly robust, reliable memory circuits with important, applicable functions. In sum, both nature's wisdom and previously designed memory modules can provide bioengineering insight to accelerate our progress toward the creation of devices capable of producing cellular memories that can last a lifetime.

ECB(Z) females produce a 97ratio3 blend of Z11- and E11-tetradecenyl acetate whereas ECB(E) females produce an opposite 1ratio99 ratio of the Z and E isomers. Males of each race respond specifically to their conspecific female's blend. A closely related species, the Asian corn borer (ACB), O. furnacalis, uses a 3ratio2 blend of Z12- and E12-tetradecenyl acetate, and is believed to have evolved from an ECB-like ancestor. To further knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of pheromone detection and its evolution among closely related species we identified and characterized sex pheromone receptors from ECB(Z).Homology-dependent (degenerate PCR primers designed to conserved amino acid motifs) and homology-independent (pyrophosphate sequencing of antennal cDNA) approaches were used to identify candidate sex pheromone transcripts. Expression in male and female antennae was assayed by quantitative real-time PCR. Two-electrode voltage clamp electrophysiology was used to functionally characterize candidate receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes.We characterized five sex pheromone receptors, OnOrs1 and 3-6. Their transcripts were 14-100 times more abundant in male compared to female antennae. OnOr6 was highly selective for Z11-tetradecenyl acetate (EC(50) = 0.86+/-0.27 microM) and was at least three orders of magnitude less responsive to E11-tetradecenyl acetate. Surprisingly, OnOr1, 3 and 5 responded to all four pheromones tested (Z11- and E11-tetradecenyl acetate, and Z12- and E12-tetradecenyl acetate) and to Z9-tetradecenyl acetate, a behavioral antagonist. OnOr1 was selective for E12-tetradecenyl acetate based on an efficacy that was at least 5-fold greater compared to the other four components. This combination of specifically- and broadly-responsive pheromone receptors corresponds to published results of sensory neuron activity in vivo. Receptors broadly-responsive to a class of pheromone components may provide a mechanism for variation in the male moth response that enables population level shifts in pheromone blend use."

Recently, the initiation and growth of GBM has been linked to brain tumor-initiating cells (BTICs), which are poorly differentiated and share features with neural stem cells (NSCs). Here we describe a kinome-wide RNA interference screen to identify factors that control the tumorigenicity of BTICs. We identified several genes whose silencing induces differentiation of BTICs derived from multiple GBM patients. In particular, knockdown of the adaptor protein TRRAP significantly increased differentiation of cultured BTICs, sensitized the cells to apoptotic stimuli, and negatively affected cell cycle progression. TRRAP knockdown also significantly suppressed tumor formation upon intracranial BTIC implantation into mice.

Thus, it may be possible to target BTICs by developing differentiation-inducing therapies for GBM tumors. This approach requires an understanding of the genes and pathways that are involved in the maintenance of the poorly differentiated, tumor-initiating cell state. In this study, we established and characterized BTICs from several primary GBM tumors and identified genes regulating their differentiation through an unbiased, kinome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) screen (∼500 kinase targets). To further validate the screen results, we show that one candidate gene known as transformation/transcription domain-associated protein (TRRAP) is required for BTIC tumorigenicity in vitro and in vivo. To establish BTIC expansion and culture conditions suitable for the automated imaging required for this large-scale RNAi screen, we optimized adherent cell culture conditions that have been previously reported for the undifferentiated growth of NSCs and BTICs (Gage et al., 1995Gage F.H.

Under these BTIC conditions (poly-D-lysine/laminin-coated culture dishes and Neurobasal medium supplemented with the mitogens FGF/EGF), monolayer-cultured cells were reproducibly derived from five different primary human GBM specimens (GBM-1 to GBM-5; Figure S1 available online). These maintained both distinct global gene expression patterns and differential expression of several glioma candidate genes, reflecting GBM tumor heterogeneity (Figure S1). We next evaluated the neural stem cell-like characteristics and differentiation properties of early culture passage GBM-derived monolayer cells by using established in vitro and in vivo assays (Gage et al., 1995Gage F.H.

Res. 2006; 59: 54R-58RCrossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Under BTIC conditions, the majority of these cells maintained an undifferentiated phenotype as indicated by a high percentage of cells positive for the neural precursor/glioma markers Nestin and Sox2 (∼80% and 60%, respectively; Figures 1A and 1G) and the proliferation marker Ki67 (∼60%; Figures 1C and 1G), as well as a low percentage of differentiated cells expressing the astroglial marker GFAP (<10%) or the neuronal marker TuJ1 (<5%; GFAP-TuJ1 double-positive cells were <2%; Figures 1E and 1G). Upon withdrawal of the mitogens FGF/EGF, the percentage of differentiated cells increased by ∼2-fold, while a substantial cell population remained proliferative (∼40% Ki67-positive cells), consistent with an autocrine mitogenic activity reported previously for mitogen-depleted cultures of glioma stem cells (Li et al., 2009Li G. Chen Z. Hu Y.D. Wei H. Li D. Ji H. Wang D.L. Autocrine factors sustain glioblastoma stem cell self-renewal.Oncol. Rep. 2009; 21: 419-424PubMed Google Scholar). Expectedly, addition of serum induced a prodifferentiation effect of all specimen-derived cells as reflected by a ∼4-fold increase of GFAP- or TuJ1-positive cells and a concurrent reduction of Nestin, Sox2, and Ki67 immunoreactivity (Figure 1G). Addition of the cytokine BMP4 (50 nM) to the FGF/EGF-containing BTIC medium elicited a differentiation phenotype in all specimens at a level comparable to mitogen-depleted, serum-treated cultures. To evaluate the in vivo tumorigenicity of the patient-derived monolayer cultured cells, they were genetically tagged with firefly luciferase (F-luc) and their growth was monitored by noninvasive bioluminescence imaging after implantation into the forebrain of CB17/SCID mice (Figure S1). Injection of 10,000 or 30,000 early passage cells led to efficient tumor growth over 15 weeks in 100% of the cases. Subsequent histological analysis and staining for GFAP, Ki67, and human-specific Nestin confirmed a large tumor burden in animals 15 weeks after implantation (Figures 1H–1J; Figure S1). Importantly, the xenograft tumors showed characteristics of high-grade gliomas including high cellularity, tumor heterogeneity, proliferation, and massive infiltration into areas adjacent to the implantation site and even into relatively distant brain areas (e.g., the olfactory bulbs). In line with recent reports (Fael Al-Mayhani et al., 2009Fael Al-Mayhani T.M. Ball S.L. Zhao J.W. Fawcett J. Ichimura K. Collins P.V. Watts C.

We next established a quantifiable assay of BTIC differentiation suitable for a high-throughput RNAi screen. BTICs were grown in precoated 384-well microtiter plates (∼1000 cells/well) and transduced with lentiviral particles produced from a nontargeting shRNA control plasmid encoding GFP (shGL3). Viral transduction was efficient as indicated by 60%–90% GFP-expressing cells in distinct experiments. To establish a positive control for a BTIC differentiation phenotype, shGL3-transduced BTICs were treated with BMP4 and analyzed after 6 days by automated image analysis after fixation and nuclear staining (Figures 2A–2C; Figure S2). To minimize potential screen artifacts, several parameters were combined to quantitatively represent the BTIC differentiation phenotype including (1) the percentage of GFP-expressing cells, reflecting individual transduction efficiency of the lentiviral shRNA constructs (the threshold was set to >50% transduction efficiency), (2) the number of total nuclei per well to monitor potential cytotoxicity (the threshold was set to >200 nuclei/well), (3) the number of small cell clusters containing four or fewer cells to monitor the overt “cell dispersion” phenotype in the positive control (significantly increases by ≥10-fold upon BMP4-induced differentiation relative to control BTICs), and (4) the mean number of cells per colony containing five or more cells to monitor self-renewal/proliferation properties (significantly decreases by ≥4-fold upon BMP4-induced differentiation compared to control BTICs). For the kinome-wide screen, we transduced early passage GBM-1 cells with an arrayed human kinome lentiviral shRNA library targeting ∼500 kinases (an average of 2.8 shRNAs per target, The Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation, La Jolla, CA). The cells were cultured in BTIC medium containing FGF/EGF and data were analyzed 6 days after viral transduction. “Hits” were based on the smallest Euclidean distance (based on a three-dimensional plot of the parameters described above) to the BMP4 control falling into the 3-fold standard deviation from the screening mean (Figure 2D; Figure S2 and Table S1). Three independent experiments yielded 68 distinct shRNA target genes, 10 of which (including IGF1R, MAP3K1, MAPKAPK2, and TRRAP) were each represented by two independent shRNAs that decreased their target mRNA transcript levels by 2- to 5-fold as assessed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) (Figure S2). Next, we generated a focused library comprising all hit shRNAs obtained from the primary screen and performed validation screens with all specimen-derived monolayer-cultured BTIC lines (GBM-1 to -5). Two independent experiments yielded 59 out of 68 gene knockdowns that reproduced in at least one BTIC specimen (gating criteria are described in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures). These hits were further categorized into groups such as tumorigenesis and cell signaling by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Ingenuity Systems) (Table S2). To evaluate the level of differentiation induced by each gene knockdown in different GBM specimens, we included GFAP staining as an additional parameter for image analysis and calculated a “differentiation index” (D.I. = percent of GFP-GFAP double-positive cells divided by the mean cells per colony) ( Figures 2E–2H, 3A, and 3B). Of the gene knockdowns that elicited a strong differentiation phenotype in all GBM specimens, MLCK and TRIO have been previously reported to mediate the invasive behavior of GBM (Kucharczak et al., 2001Kucharczak J.

Knockdown of CDC2L6, LYN, TRRAP, MAP3K1, and NEK7 induced differentiation in three or more GBM specimens (Figure 3B), and these genes also showed higher mRNA expression levels (≥2-fold; MAP3K1 ≥ 5-fold) in BTICs compared to cultured human astrocytes as assessed by transcriptional profiling. Interestingly, MAP3K has also been recently reported to be overexpressed in invasive glioma cells and linked to p38 activation (Demuth et al., 2007Demuth T. Reavie L.B. Rennert J.L. Nakada M. Nakada S. Hoelzinger D.B. Beaudry C.E. Henrichs A.N. Anderson E.M. Berens M.E.

Cancer Ther. 2007; 6: 1212-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The strongest differentiation phenotype was elicited by knockdown of TRRAP, which also showed the highest reproducibility among all BTIC specimens (mean D.I. = 9.3 ± 3.1; mean D.I. of BMP4 control = 6.74 ± 3.1) (Figures 3A and 3B). TRRAP is an adaptor protein found in multiprotein/chromatin complexes sharing homology with phosphoinositide-3-OH-kinase-related (PIKK) proteins and has been linked to several human malignancies (Bashyam et al., 2005Bashyam M.D. Bair R.

It is thought to regulate chromatin-related processes, embryonic development, oncogenic transformation through c-Myc and E2F-mediated transcription, and cell cycle progression in a cell type-specific manner (McMahon et al., 1998McMahon S.B.

Analysis of TRRAP expression in BTICs by qRT-PCR revealed that all monolayer-cultured BTICs and GBM-1-derived xenografts (XG) expressed higher (>2-fold) levels of TRRAP relative to more differentiated cell types including serum-cultured glioma cells (SGL; U87, U343, serum-cultured GBM-1), nontransformed human astrocytes (AS), normal brain tissue (NB), and human adult neural progenitors obtained from patients undergoing epilepsy surgery (NP, culture conditions described in Walton et al., 2006Walton N.M.

Additionally, immunostaining for TRRAP showed the expected nuclear localization in BTICs and coexpressed with Nestin (Figures 3E and 3F). We next assessed the self-renewal capacity of TRRAP-deficient cells by determining their sphere-forming potential upon silencing of TRRAP expression by using a commercially available lentiviral shRNA expression system (MISSION shRNA, Sigma). Two different shRNAs (shTR1, shTR2), distinct from those used in the RNAi screen, efficiently decreased TRRAP mRNA levels compared to the nontargeting control shRNA (shCO) as assessed by qRT-PCR and immunocytochemistry (shTR1: 50%–70% reduction, shTR2: 60%–85% reduction, Figures 3D and 3G). All shCO-tranduced BTICs (GBM-1 to -6) efficiently formed spheres and could be further propagated as spheres at a low seeding density of 1 cell/μL under nonadherent conditions (Figure 4B). In contrast, knockdown of TRRAP led to overt changes in cell shape such as flattened morphology and formation of cellular protrusions and inhibited proliferation in all BTICs (Figures 4A, 4D, and 4E). Sphere formation was reduced 4- to 5-fold in TRRAP knockdown BTICs and secondary sphere formation was not observed. Moreover, TRRAP knockdown cells failed to self-renew at a clonal seeding density (<5 cells per well of 96-well plate), whereas ∼15% of individually seeded control BTICs gave rise to colonies (Figure 4C). The decrease in self-renewal and proliferation capacity was in line with a significant decrease (>4-fold) of Nestin/Sox2 and Nestin/Ki67 immunopositivity upon TRRAP silencing, while GFAP staining concomitantly increased (Figures 4D and 4F; Figure S3). TuJ1 staining was consistently 2- to 3-fold elevated in TRRAP knockdown cells. TRRAP has been implicated in DNA repair mechanisms that have been shown to cause resistance to radiation in glioma stem cells (Bao et al., 2006Bao S. Wu Q. McLendon R.E. Hao Y. Shi Q. Hjelmeland A.B. Dewhirst M.W. Bigner D.D. Rich J.N. Glioma stem cells promote radioresistance by preferential activation of the DNA damage response.Nature. 2006; 444: 756-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (4431) Google Scholar). TRRAP may facilitate DNA repair by chromatin remodeling, thus promoting access of repair factors such as 53BP1 to double-strand breaks (DSBs) (Murr et al., 2006Murr R. Loizou J.I. Yang Y.G. Cuenin C. Li H. Wang Z.Q. Herceg Z. Histone acetylation by Trrap-Tip60 modulates loading of repair proteins and repair of DNA double-strand breaks.Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). To investigate whether knockdown of TRRAP affects recruitment of 53BP1 to DNA repair sites in BTICs, we induced DSBs by irradiation of GBM-1 cells (dose: 8 Gy). TRRAP deficiency led to a ∼2-fold increase in the percentage of cells that show an absence of foci and diffuse nuclear localization of 53BP1 relative to control cells (Figures 4G–4I). This suggests aberrant DNA repair in TRRAP-deficient cells that concomitantly become more prone to apoptosis as indicated by a ∼2-fold increase in the percentage of TUNEL-positive cells upon TRRAP knockdown (Figure 4J). Because DSB repair is thought to be a determinant of glioma cell sensitivity to cytotoxic agents (Roos et al., 2007Roos W.P. Batista L.F. Naumann S.C. Wick W. Weller M. Menck C.F. Kaina B. Apoptosis in malignant glioma cells triggered by the temozolomide-induced DNA lesion O6-methylguanine.Oncogene. 2007; 26: 186-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), we exposed BTICs to the methylating brain tumor drug temozolomide. Temozolomide (50 μM) led to a significant 2- to 3-fold increase in apoptosis in TRRAP knockdown cells as indicated by 25%–40% TUNEL-positive cells compared to ∼10% TUNEL-positive control cells after 72 hr (Figure 4J). Overall, these results suggest that TRRAP deficiency elevates the sensitivity of BTICs to DNA damage and consequently apoptosis, particularly upon exposure to cytotoxic stimuli. To investigate how knockdown of TRRAP affects the BTIC transcriptome, we performed microarray gene expression analysis of shCO- and shTR-transduced GBM-1 cells (Figure S4). Notably, TRRAP knockdown induced downregulation (>2-fold) of genes that are associated with cell growth and self-renewal (e.g., CCNA2, DLL3, MKI67, SKP2, FZD1, SMO, TCF3). At the same time, cytokines upstream of Stat signaling (LIF, IL-6) and BMP/Smad signaling (BMP8) were upregulated (>2-fold) upon TRRAP knockdown. Consistent with this observation, sustained levels of phosphorylated Stat3 (both at S727 and T705) and phosphorylated Smad1/5 were detectable in shTR-expressing GBM-1 cells (Figure S4). All differentially expressed genes in TRRAP knockdown cells (filtered by a 2-fold up/downregulation relative to values in control"

We examined host genetic factors hypothesized to play a role in determining which subset of individuals infected with oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) have persistent infection and further develop cervical pre-cancer/cancer compared to the majority of infected individuals who will clear infection.We evaluated 7140 tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 305 candidate genes hypothesized to be involved in DNA repair, viral infection and cell entry in 416 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 3 (CIN3)/cancer cases, 356 HPV persistent women (median: 25 months), and 425 random controls (RC) from the 10,049 women Guanacaste Costa Rica Natural History study. We used logistic regression to compute odds ratios and p-trend for CIN3/cancer and HPV persistence in relation to SNP genotypes and haplotypes (adjusted for age). We obtained pathway and gene-level summary of associations by computing the adaptive combination of p-values. Genes/regions statistically significantly associated with CIN3/cancer included the viral infection and cell entry genes 2',5' oligoadenylate synthetase gene 3 (OAS3), sulfatase 1 (SULF1), and interferon gamma (IFNG); the DNA repair genes deoxyuridine triphosphate (DUT), dosage suppressor of mck 1 homolog (DMC1), and general transcription factor IIH, polypeptide 3 (GTF2H4); and the EVER1 and EVER2 genes (p<0.01). From each region, the single most significant SNPs associated with CIN3/cancer were OAS3 rs12302655, SULF1 rs4737999, IFNG rs11177074, DUT rs3784621, DMC1 rs5757133, GTF2H4 rs2894054, EVER1/EVER2 rs9893818 (p-trends</=0.001). SNPs for OAS3, SULF1, DUT, and GTF2H4 were associated with HPV persistence whereas IFNG and EVER1/EVER2 SNPs were associated with progression to CIN3/cancer. We note that the associations observed were less than two-fold. We identified variations DNA repair and viral binding and cell entry genes associated with CIN3/cancer. Our results require replication but suggest that different genes may be responsible for modulating risk in the two critical transition steps important for cervical carcinogenesis: HPV persistence and disease progression."
https://openalex.org/W1992763115,"Background Chitinases are prevalent in life and are found in species including archaea, bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals. They break down chitin, which is the second most abundant carbohydrate in nature after cellulose. Hence, they are important for maintaining a balance between carbon and nitrogen trapped as insoluble chitin in biomass. Chitinases are classified into two families, 18 and 19 glycoside hydrolases. In addition to a catalytic domain, which is a triosephosphate isomerase barrel, many family 18 chitinases contain another module, i.e., chitinase insertion domain. While numerous studies focus on the biological role of the catalytic domain in chitinase activity, the function of the chitinase insertion domain is not completely understood. Bioinformatics offers an important avenue in which to facilitate understanding the role of residues within the chitinase insertion domain in chitinase function. Results Twenty-seven chitinase insertion domain sequences, which include four experimentally determined structures and span five kingdoms, were aligned and analyzed using a modified sequence entropy parameter. Thirty-two positions with conserved residues were identified. The role of these conserved residues was explored by conducting a structural analysis of a number of holo-enzymes. Hydrogen bonding and van der Waals calculations revealed a distinct subset of four conserved residues constituting two sequence motifs that interact with oligosaccharides. The other conserved residues may be key to the structure, folding, and stability of this domain. Conclusions Sequence and structural studies of the chitinase insertion domains conducted within the framework of evolution identified four conserved residues which clearly interact with the substrates. Furthermore, evolutionary studies propose a link between the appearance of the chitinase insertion domain and the function of family 18 chitinases in the subfamily A."
https://openalex.org/W1997303694,"Objectives Injury related to violent acts is a problem in every society. Although some authors have examined the geography of violent crime, few have focused on the spatio-temporal patterns of violent injury and none have used an ambulance dataset to explore the spatial characteristics of injury. The purpose of this study was to describe the combined spatial and temporal characteristics of violent injury in a large urban centre. Methodology/Principal Findings Using a geomatics framework and geographic information systems software, we studied 4,587 ambulance dispatches and 10,693 emergency room admissions for violent injury occurrences among adults (aged 18–64) in Toronto, Canada, during 2002 and 2004, using population-based datasets. We created kernel density and choropleth maps for 24-hour periods and four-hour daily time periods and compared location of ambulance dispatches and patient residences with local land use and socioeconomic characteristics. We used multivariate regressions to control for confounding factors. We found the locations of violent injury and the residence locations of those injured were both closely related to each other and clearly clustered in certain parts of the city characterised by high numbers of bars, social housing units, and homeless shelters, as well as lower household incomes. The night and early morning showed a distinctive peak in injuries and a shift in the location of injuries to a “nightlife” district. The locational pattern of patient residences remained unchanged during those times. Conclusions/Significance Our results demonstrate that there is a distinctive spatio-temporal pattern in violent injury reflected in the ambulance data. People injured in this urban centre more commonly live in areas of social deprivation. During the day, locations of injury and locations of residences are similar. However, later at night, the injury location of highest density shifts to a “nightlife” district, whereas the residence locations of those most at risk of injury do not change."
https://openalex.org/W2044288182,"Vibrio parahaemolyticus is an important pathogen causing food-borne disease worldwide. An 80-kb pathogenicity island (Vp-PAI), which contains two tdh (thermostable direct hemolysin) genes and a set of genes for the type III secretion system (T3SS2), is closely related to the pathogenicity of this bacterium. However, the regulatory mechanisms of Vp-PAI's gene expression are poorly understood. Here we report that two novel ToxR-like transcriptional regulatory proteins (VtrA and VtrB) regulate the expression of the genes encoded within the Vp-PAI region, including those for TDH and T3SS2-related proteins. Expression of vtrB was under control of the VtrA, as vector-expressed vtrB was able to recover a functional protein secretory capacity for T3SS2, independent of VtrA. Moreover, these regulatory proteins were essential for T3SS2-dependent biological activities, such as in vitro cytotoxicity and in vivo enterotoxicity. Enterotoxic activities of vtrA and/or vtrB deletion strains derived from the wild-type strain were almost absent, showing fluid accumulation similar to non-infected control. Whole genome transcriptional profiling of vtrA or vtrB deletion strains revealed that the expression levels of over 60 genes were downregulated significantly in these deletion mutant strains and that such genes were almost exclusively located in the Vp-PAI region. These results strongly suggest that VtrA and VtrB are master regulators for virulence gene expression in the Vp-PAI and play critical roles in the pathogenicity of this bacterium."
https://openalex.org/W2069421427,"In Escherichia coli, cytotoxic DNA methyl lesions on the N1 position of purines and N3 position of pyrimidines are primarily repaired by the 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG) iron(II) dependent dioxygenase, AlkB. AlkB repairs 1-methyladenine (1-meA) and 3-methylcytosine (3-meC) lesions, but it also repairs 1-methylguanine (1-meG) and 3-methylthymine (3-meT) at a much less efficient rate. How the AlkB enzyme is able to locate and identify methylated bases in ssDNA has remained an open question.We determined the crystal structures of the E. coli AlkB protein holoenzyme and the AlkB-ssDNA complex containing a 1-meG lesion. We coupled this to site-directed mutagenesis of amino acids in and around the active site, and tested the effects of these mutations on the ability of the protein to bind both damaged and undamaged DNA, as well as catalyze repair of a methylated substrate.A comparison of our substrate-bound AlkB-ssDNA complex with our unliganded holoenzyme reveals conformational changes of residues within the active site that are important for binding damaged bases. Site-directed mutagenesis of these residues reveals novel insight into their roles in DNA damage recognition and repair. Our data support a model that the AlkB protein utilizes at least two distinct conformations in searching and binding methylated bases within DNA: a ""searching"" mode and ""repair"" mode. Moreover, we are able to functionally separate these modes through mutagenesis of residues that affect one or the other binding state. Finally, our mutagenesis experiments show that amino acid D135 of AlkB participates in both substrate specificity and catalysis."

https://openalex.org/W2031764972,"Microphthalmia in sheep is an autosomal recessive inherited congenital anomaly found within the Texel breed. It is characterized by extremely small or absent eyes and affected lambs are absolutely blind. For the first time, we use a genome-wide ovine SNP array for positional cloning of a Mendelian trait in sheep. Genotyping 23 cases and 23 controls using Illumina's OvineSNP50 BeadChip allowed us to localize the causative mutation for microphthalmia to a 2.4 Mb interval on sheep chromosome 22 by association and homozygosity mapping. The PITX3 gene is located within this interval and encodes a homeodomain-containing transcription factor involved in vertebrate lens formation. An abnormal development of the lens vesicle was shown to be the primary event in ovine microphthalmia. Therefore, we considered PITX3 a positional and functional candidate gene. An ovine BAC clone was sequenced, and after full-length cDNA cloning the PITX3 gene was annotated. Here we show that the ovine microphthalmia phenotype is perfectly associated with a missense mutation (c.338G>C, p.R113P) in the evolutionary conserved homeodomain of PITX3. Selection against this candidate causative mutation can now be used to eliminate microphthalmia from Texel sheep in production systems. Furthermore, the identification of a naturally occurring PITX3 mutation offers the opportunity to use the Texel as a genetically characterized large animal model for human microphthalmia."
https://openalex.org/W2060784546,"Background Game theory and the Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) game in particular, which captures the paradox of cooperative interactions that lead to benefits but entail costs to the interacting individuals, have constituted a powerful tool in the study of the mechanisms of reciprocity. However, in non-human animals most tests of reciprocity in PD games have resulted in sustained defection strategies. As a consequence, it has been suggested that under such stringent conditions as the PD game humans alone have evolved the necessary cognitive abilities to engage in reciprocity, namely, numerical discrimination, memory and control of temporal discounting. Methodology/Principal Findings We use an iterated PD game to test rats (Rattus norvegicus) for the presence of such cognitive abilities by manipulating the strategy of the opponent, Tit-for-Tat and Pseudo-Random, or the relative size of the temptation to defect. We found that rats shape their behaviour according to the opponent's strategy and the relative outcome resulting from cooperative or defective moves. Finally, we show that the behaviour of rats is contingent upon their motivational state (hungry versus sated). Conclusions/Significance Here we show that rats understand the payoff matrix of the PD game and the strategy of the opponent. Importantly, our findings reveal that rats possess the necessary cognitive capacities for reciprocity-based cooperation to emerge in the context of a prisoner's dilemma. Finally, the validation of the rat as a model to study reciprocity-based cooperation during the PD game opens new avenues of research in experimental neuroscience."
https://openalex.org/W2076310052,"Background We have previously identified genome-wide DNA methylation changes in a cell line model of breast cancer metastasis. These complex epigenetic changes that we observed, along with concurrent karyotype analyses, have led us to hypothesize that complex genomic alterations in cancer cells (deletions, translocations and ploidy) are superimposed over promoter-specific methylation events that are responsible for gene-specific expression changes observed in breast cancer metastasis. Methodology/Principal Findings We undertook simultaneous high-resolution, whole-genome analyses of MDA-MB-468GFP and MDA-MB-468GFP-LN human breast cancer cell lines (an isogenic, paired lymphatic metastasis cell line model) using Affymetrix gene expression (U133), promoter (1.0R), and SNP/CNV (SNP 6.0) microarray platforms to correlate data from gene expression, epigenetic (DNA methylation), and combination copy number variant/single nucleotide polymorphism microarrays. Using Partek Software and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis we integrated datasets from these three platforms and detected multiple hypomethylation and hypermethylation events. Many of these epigenetic alterations correlated with gene expression changes. In addition, gene dosage events correlated with the karyotypic differences observed between the cell lines and were reflected in specific promoter methylation patterns. Gene subsets were identified that correlated hyper (and hypo) methylation with the loss (or gain) of gene expression and in parallel, with gene dosage losses and gains, respectively. Individual gene targets from these subsets were also validated for their methylation, expression and copy number status, and susceptible gene pathways were identified that may indicate how selective advantage drives the processes of tumourigenesis and metastasis. Conclusions/Significance Our approach allows more precisely profiling of functionally relevant epigenetic signatures that are associated with cancer progression and metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2091518477,"FK506 binding proteins (FKBPs), also called immunophilins, are prolyl-isomerases (PPIases) that participate in a wide variety of cellular functions including hormone signaling and protein folding. Recent studies indicate that proteins that contain PPIase activity can also alter the processing of Alzheimer's Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP). Originally identified in hematopoietic cells, FKBP52 is much more abundantly expressed in neurons, including the hippocampus, frontal cortex, and basal ganglia. Given the fact that the high molecular weight immunophilin FKBP52 is highly expressed in CNS regions susceptible to Alzheimer's, we investigated its role in Aβ toxicity. Towards this goal, we generated Aβ transgenic Drosophila that harbor gain of function or loss of function mutations of FKBP52. FKBP52 overexpression reduced the toxicity of Aβ and increased lifespan in Aβ flies, whereas loss of function of FKBP52 exacerbated these Aβ phenotypes. Interestingly, the Aβ pathology was enhanced by mutations in the copper transporters Atox1, which interacts with FKBP52, and Ctr1A and was suppressed in FKBP52 mutant flies raised on a copper chelator diet. Using mammalian cultures, we show that FKBP52 (−/−) cells have increased intracellular copper and higher levels of Aβ. This effect is reversed by reconstitution of FKBP52. Finally, we also found that FKBP52 formed stable complexes with APP through its FK506 interacting domain. Taken together, these studies identify a novel role for FKBP52 in modulating toxicity of Aβ peptides."
https://openalex.org/W2011301883,"Background Surfactant protein B (SP-B; 79 residues) belongs to the saposin protein superfamily, and plays functional roles in lung surfactant. The disulfide cross-linked, N- and C-terminal domains of SP-B have been theoretically predicted to fold as charged, amphipathic helices, suggesting their participation in surfactant activities. Earlier structural studies with Mini-B, a disulfide-linked construct based on the N- and C-terminal regions of SP-B (i.e., ∼residues 8–25 and 63–78), confirmed that these neighboring domains are helical; moreover, Mini-B retains critical in vitro and in vivo surfactant functions of the native protein. Here, we perform similar analyses on a Super Mini-B construct that has native SP-B residues (1–7) attached to the N-terminus of Mini-B, to test whether the N-terminal sequence is also involved in surfactant activity. Methodology/Results FTIR spectra of Mini-B and Super Mini-B in either lipids or lipid-mimics indicated that these peptides share similar conformations, with primary α-helix and secondary β-sheet and loop-turns. Gel electrophoresis demonstrated that Super Mini-B was dimeric in SDS detergent-polyacrylamide, while Mini-B was monomeric. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR), predictive aggregation algorithms, and molecular dynamics (MD) and docking simulations further suggested a preliminary model for dimeric Super Mini-B, in which monomers self-associate to form a dimer peptide with a “saposin-like” fold. Similar to native SP-B, both Mini-B and Super Mini-B exhibit in vitro activity with spread films showing near-zero minimum surface tension during cycling using captive bubble surfactometry. In vivo, Super Mini-B demonstrates oxygenation and dynamic compliance that are greater than Mini-B and compare favorably to full-length SP-B. Conclusion Super Mini-B shows enhanced surfactant activity, probably due to the self-assembly of monomer peptide into dimer Super Mini-B that mimics the functions and putative structure of native SP-B."
https://openalex.org/W1974559971,"Background Spx, an ArsC (arsenate reductase) family member, is a global transcriptional regulator of the microbial stress response and is highly conserved amongst Gram-positive bacteria. Bacillus subtilis Spx protein exerts positive and negative control of transcription through its interaction with the C-terminal domain of the RNA polymerase (RNAP) α subunit (αCTD). Spx activates trxA (thioredoxin) and trxB (thioredoxin reductase) in response to thiol stress, and bears an N-terminal C10XXC13 redox disulfide center that is oxidized in active Spx. Methodology/Principal Findings The structure of mutant SpxC10S showed a change in the conformation of helix α4. Amino acid substitutions R60E and K62E within and adjacent to helix α4 conferred defects in Spx-activated transcription but not Spx-dependent repression. Electrophoretic mobility-shift assays showed αCTD interaction with trxB promoter DNA, but addition of Spx generated a supershifted complex that was disrupted in the presence of reductant (DTT). Interaction of αCTD/Spx complex with promoter DNA required the cis-acting elements -45AGCA-42 and -34AGCG-31 of the trxB promoter. The SpxG52R mutant, defective in αCTD binding, did not interact with the αCTD-trxB complex. SpxR60E not only failed to complex with αCTD-trxB, but also disrupted αCTD-trxB DNA interaction. Conclusions/Significance The results show that Spx and αCTD form a complex that recognizes the promoter DNA of an Spx-controlled gene. A conformational change during oxidation of Spx to the disulfide form likely alters the structure of Spx α helix α4, which contains residues that function in transcriptional activation and αCTD/Spx-promoter interaction. The results suggest that one of these residues, R60 of the α4 region of oxidized Spx, functions in αCTD/Spx-promoter contact but not in αCTD interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2080294906,"Background Endochondral ossification is a complex process involving a series of events that are initiated by the establishment of a chondrogenic template and culminate in its replacement through the coordinated activity of osteoblasts, osteoclasts and endothelial cells. Comprehensive analyses of in vivo gene expression profiles during these processes are essential to obtain a complete understanding of the regulatory mechanisms involved. Methodology/Principal Findings To address these issues, we completed a microarray screen of three zones derived from manually segmented embryonic mouse tibiae. Classification of genes differentially expressed between each respective zone, functional categorization as well as characterization of gene expression patterns, cytogenetic loci, signaling pathways and functional motifs both confirmed reported data and provided novel insights into endochondral ossification. Parallel comparisons of the microdissected tibiae data set with our previously completed micromass culture screen further corroborated the suitability of micromass cultures for modeling gene expression in chondrocyte development. The micromass culture system demonstrated striking similarities to the in vivo microdissected tibiae screen; however, the micromass system was unable to accurately distinguish gene expression differences in the hypertrophic and mineralized zones of the tibia. Conclusions/Significance These studies allow us to better understand gene expression patterns in the growth plate and endochondral bones and provide an important technical resource for comparison of gene expression in diseased or experimentally-manipulated cartilages. Ultimately, this work will help to define the genomic context in which genes are expressed in long bones and to understand physiological and pathological ossification."
https://openalex.org/W1980228731,"The superior colliculus (SC) has been shown to play a crucial role in the initiation and coordination of eye- and head-movements. The knowledge about the function of this structure is mainly based on single-unit recordings in animals with relatively few neuroimaging studies investigating eye-movement related brain activity in humans.The present study employed high-field (7 Tesla) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate SC responses during endogenously cued saccades in humans. In response to centrally presented instructional cues, subjects either performed saccades away from (centrifugal) or towards (centripetal) the center of straight gaze or maintained fixation at the center position. Compared to central fixation, the execution of saccades elicited hemodynamic activity within a network of cortical and subcortical areas that included the SC, lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), occipital cortex, striatum, and the pulvinar.Activity in the SC was enhanced contralateral to the direction of the saccade (i.e., greater activity in the right as compared to left SC during leftward saccades and vice versa) during both centrifugal and centripetal saccades, thereby demonstrating that the contralateral predominance for saccade execution that has been shown to exist in animals is also present in the human SC. In addition, centrifugal saccades elicited greater activity in the SC than did centripetal saccades, while also being accompanied by an enhanced deactivation within the prefrontal default-mode network. This pattern of brain activity might reflect the reduced processing effort required to move the eyes toward as compared to away from the center of straight gaze, a position that might serve as a spatial baseline in which the retinotopic and craniotopic reference frames are aligned."
https://openalex.org/W2104666608,"Background Seven genes involved in folate metabolism are located on chromosome 21. Previous studies have shown that folate deficiency may contribute to mental retardation in Down's syndrome (DS). Methodology We investigated the effect of oral folate supplementation (daily dose of 1.0±0.3 mg/kg) on cognitive functions in DS children, aged from 3 to 30 months. They received 1 mg/kg leucovorin or placebo daily, for 12 months, in a single-centre, randomised, double-blind study. Folinic acid (leucovorin, LV) was preferred to folic acid as its bioavailability is higher. The developmental age (DA) of the patients was assessed on the Brunet-Lezine scale, from baseline to the end of treatment. Results The intent-to-treat analysis (113 patients) did not show a positive effect of leucovorin treatment. However, it identified important factors influencing treatment effect, such as age, sex, and concomitant treatments, including thyroid treatment in particular. A per protocol analysis was carried out on patients evaluated by the same examiner at the beginning and end of the treatment period. This analysis of 87 patients (43 LV-treated vs. 44 patients on placebo) revealed a positive effect of leucovorin on developmental age (DA). DA was 53.1% the normal value with leucovorin and only 44.1% with placebo (p<0.05). This positive effect of leucovorin was particularly strong in patients receiving concomitant thyroxin treatment (59.5% vs. 41.8%, p<0.05). No adverse event related to leucovorin was observed. Conclusion These results suggest that leucovorin improves the psychomotor development of children with Down's syndrome, at least in some subgroups of the DS population, particularly those on thyroxin treatment.

A recent study detected living descendents of an extinct Galápagos tortoise species (Chelonoidis elephantopus) once endemic to Floreana Island on the neighboring island of Isabela. This finding adds to the growing cryptic diversity detected among these species in the wild. There also exists a large number of Galápagos tortoises in captivity of ambiguous origin. The recently accumulated population-level haplotypic and genotypic data now available for C. elephantopus add a critical reference population to the existing database of 11 extant species for investigating the origin of captive individuals of unknown ancestry. Methodology/Findings We reanalyzed mitochondrial DNA control region haplotypes and microsatellite genotypes of 156 captive individuals using an expanded reference database that included all extant Galápagos tortoise species as well as the extinct species from Floreana. Nine individuals (six females and three males) exhibited strong signatures of Floreana ancestry and a high probability of assignment to C. elephantopus as detected by Bayesian assignment and clustering analyses of empirical and simulated data. One male with high assignment probability to C. elephantopus based on microsatellite genotypic data also possessed a “Floreana-like” mitochondrial DNA haplotype. Significance Historical DNA analysis of museum specimens has provided critical spatial and temporal components to ecological, evolutionary, taxonomic and conservation-related research, but rarely has it informed ex situ species recovery efforts. Here, the availability of population-level genotypic data from the extinct C. elephantopus enabled the identification of nine Galápagos tortoise individuals of substantial conservation value that were previously misassigned to extant species of varying conservation status. As all captive individuals of C. elephantopus ancestry currently reside at a centralized breeding facility on Santa Cruz, these findings permit breeding efforts to commence in support of the reestablishment of this extinct species to its native range."
https://openalex.org/W1996986490,"Background p300 functions as a transcriptional co-activator to regulate many cellular responses such as cell growth, transformation, development and differentiation. It has been shown to affect the transcriptional activity of p53 which regulates p21Waf1/CIP1 expression, however, the role of p300 in differentiation remains unclear. Methodology and Principal Findings Knockdown of p300 protein with short hairpin RNA (shRNA) molecules delays human neonatal foreskin keratinocyte (HFKs) differentiation. Moreover, depletion of p300 increases the proliferative capacity of HFKs, extends the life span of cells and allows differentiated HFKs to re-enter the cell cycle. Studies indicate that depletion of p300 down-regulates the acetylation and expression of p53, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis shows that induction of p21Waf1/CIP1 in early differentiation is a result of p300 dependent activation of p53 and that depletion of p21Waf1/CIP1 results in the delay of differentiation and a phenotype similar to p300 depletion. Conclusions p300 has a direct role in the control of cell growth and differentiation in primary epithelial cells, and p21Waf1/CIP1 is an important mediator of these p300 functions."
https://openalex.org/W2064652456,"Horizontal gene transfer is a key step in the evolution of Enterobacteriaceae. By acquiring virulence determinants of foreign origin, commensals can evolve into pathogens. In Enterobacteriaceae, horizontal transfer of these virulence determinants is largely dependent on transfer by plasmids, phages, genomic islands (GIs) and genomic modules (GMs). The High Pathogenicity Island (HPI) is a GI encoding virulence genes that can be transferred between different Enterobacteriaceae. We investigated the HPI because it was present in an Enterobacter hormaechei outbreak strain (EHOS). Genome sequence analysis showed that the EHOS contained an integration site for mobile elements and harbored two GIs and three putative GMs, including a new variant of the HPI (HPI-ICEEh1). We demonstrate, for the first time, that combinatorial transfers of GIs and GMs between Enterobacter cloacae complex isolates must have occurred. Furthermore, the excision and circularization of several combinations of the GIs and GMs was demonstrated. Because of its flexibility, the multiple integration site of mobile DNA can be considered an integration hotspot (IHS) that increases the genomic plasticity of the bacterium. Multiple combinatorial transfers of diverse combinations of the HPI and other genomic elements among Enterobacteriaceae may accelerate the generation of new pathogenic strains."
https://openalex.org/W1999720150,"The paternally expressed gene PEG10 is a retrotransposon derived gene adapted through mammalian evolution located on human chromosome 7q21. PEG10 codes for at least two proteins, PEG10-RF1 and PEG10-RF1/2, by -1 frameshift translation. Overexpression or reinduced PEG10 expression was seen in malignancies, like hepatocellular carcinoma or B-cell acute and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. PEG10 was also shown to promote adipocyte differentiation. Experimental evidence suggests that the PEG10-RF1 protein is an inhibitor of apoptosis and mediates cell proliferation. Here we present new data on the genomic organization of PEG10 by identifying the major transcription start site, a new splice variant and report the cloning and analysis of 1.9 kb of the PEG10 promoter. Furthermore, we show for the first time that PEG10 translation is initiated at a non-AUG start codon upstream of the previously predicted AUG codon as well as at the AUG codon. The finding that PEG10 translation is initiated at different sides adds a new aspect to the already interesting feature of PEG10's −1 frameshift translation mechanism. It is now important to unravel the cellular functions of the PEG10 protein variants and how they are related to normal or pathological conditions. The generated promoter-reporter constructs can be used for future studies to investigate how PEG10 expression is regulated. In summary, our study provides new data on the genomic organization as well as expression and translation of PEG10, a prerequisite in order to study and understand the role of PEG10 in cancer, embryonic development and normal cell homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W1974192640,"Background Allometric studies have shown that individual growth rate is inversely related to body size across a broad spectrum of organisms that vary greatly in size. Fewer studies have documented such patterns within species. No data exist directly documenting the influence of colony size on growth rate for microscopic, colonial organisms. Methodology/Principal Findings To determine if similar negative relationships between growth rate and size hold for colonial organisms, we developed a technique for measuring the growth of individual colonies of a bloom-forming, toxic cyanobacterium, Microcystis aeruginosa using microscopy and digital image analysis. For five out of six genotypes of M. aeruginosa isolated from lakes in Michigan and Alabama, we found significant negative relationships between colony size and growth rate. We found large intraspecific variation in both the slope of these relationships and in the growth rate of colonies at a standard size. In addition, growth rate estimates for individual colonies were generally consistent with population growth rates measured using standard batch culture. Conclusions/Significance Given that colony size varies widely within populations, our results imply that natural populations of colonial phytoplankton exist as a mosaic of individuals with widely varying ecological attributes (since size strongly affects growth rate, grazing mortality, and migration speed). Quantifying the influence of colony size on growth rate will permit development of more accurate, predictive models of ecological interactions (e.g., competition, herbivory) and their role in the proliferation of harmful algal blooms, in addition to increasing our understanding about why these interactions vary in strength within and across environments."
https://openalex.org/W1992062945,"The adhesion G-protein-coupled receptor CD97 is present in normal colonic enterocytes but overexpressed in colorectal carcinoma. To investigate the function of CD97 in colorectal carcinogenesis, transgenic Tg(villin-CD97) mice overexpressing CD97 in enterocytes were generated and subjected to azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis-associated tumorigenesis. Unexpectedly, we found a CD97 cDNA copy number-dependent reduction of DSS-induced colitis in Tg compared to wild-type (WT) mice that was confirmed by applying a simple DSS protocol. Ultrastructural analysis revealed that overexpression of CD97 strengthened lateral cell-cell contacts between enterocytes, which, in contrast, were weakened in CD97 knockout (Ko) mice. Transepithelial resistance was not altered in Tg and Ko mice, indicating that tight junctions were not affected. In Tg murine and normal human colonic enterocytes as well as in colorectal cell lines CD97 was localized preferentially in E-cadherin-based adherens junctions. CD97 overexpression upregulated membrane-bound but not cytoplasmic or nuclear beta-catenin and reduced phospho-beta-catenin, labeled for degradation. This was associated with inactivation of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) and activation of Akt. In summary, CD97 increases the structural integrity of enterocytic adherens junctions by increasing and stabilizing junctional beta-catenin, thereby regulating intestinal epithelial strength and attenuating experimental colitis."

https://openalex.org/W2007721271,"Thiamine monophosphatase (TMPase, also known as Fluoride-resistant acid phosphatase or FRAP) is a classic histochemical marker of small- to medium-diameter dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons and has primarily been studied in the rat. Previously, we found that TMPase was molecularly identical to Prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) using mice. In addition, PAP was expressed in a majority of nonpeptidergic, isolectin B4-binding (IB4+) nociceptive neurons and a subset of peptidergic, calcitonin gene-related peptide-containing (CGRP+) nociceptive neurons. At the time, we were unable to determine if PAP was present in rat DRG neurons because the antibody we used did not cross-react with PAP in rat tissues. In our present study, we generated a chicken polyclonal antibody against the secretory isoform of mouse PAP. This antibody detects mouse, rat and human PAP protein on western blots. Additionally, this antibody detects PAP in mouse and rat small- to medium-diameter DRG neurons and axon terminals in lamina II of spinal cord. In the rat, 92.5% of all PAP+ cells bind the nonpeptidergic marker IB4 and 31.8% of all PAP+ cells contain the peptidergic marker CGRP. Although PAP is found in peptidergic and nonpeptidergic neurons of mice and rats, the percentage of PAP+ neurons that express these markers differs between species. Moreover, PAP+ axon terminals in the rat partially overlap with Protein kinase Cgamma (PKCgamma+) interneurons in dorsal spinal cord whereas PAP+ axon terminals in the mouse terminate dorsal to PKCgamma+ interneurons. Collectively, our studies highlight similarities and differences in PAP localization within nociceptive neurons of mice and rats."
https://openalex.org/W2061026204,"Insulin-producing pancreatic islet β cells (β-cells) are destroyed, severely depleted or functionally impaired in diabetes. Therefore, replacing functional β-cell mass would advance clinical diabetes management. We have previously demonstrated the importance of Cdk4 in regulating β-cell mass. Cdk4-deficient mice display β-cell hypoplasia and develop diabetes, whereas β-cell hyperplasia is observed in mice expressing an active Cdk4R24C kinase. While β-cell replication appears to be the primary mechanism responsible for β-cell mass increase, considerable evidence also supports a contribution from the pancreatic ductal epithelium in generation of new β-cells. Further, while it is believed that majority of β-cells are in a state of ‘dormancy’, it is unclear if and to what extent the quiescent cells can be coaxed to participate in the β-cell regenerative response. Here, we address these queries using a model of partial pancreatectomy (PX) in Cdk4 mutant mice. To investigate the kinetics of the regeneration process precisely, we performed DNA analog-based lineage-tracing studies followed by mathematical modeling. Within a week after PX, we observed considerable proliferation of islet β-cells and ductal epithelial cells. Interestingly, the mathematical model showed that recruitment of quiescent cells into the active cell cycle promotes β-cell mass reconstitution in the Cdk4R24C pancreas. Moreover, within 24–48 hours post-PX, ductal epithelial cells expressing the transcription factor Pdx-1 dramatically increased. We also detected insulin-positive cells in the ductal epithelium along with a significant increase of islet-like cell clusters in the Cdk4R24C pancreas. We conclude that Cdk4 not only promotes β-cell replication, but also facilitates the activation of β-cell progenitors in the ductal epithelium. In addition, we show that Cdk4 controls β-cell mass by recruiting quiescent cells to enter the cell cycle. Comparing the contribution of cell proliferation and islet-like clusters to the total increase in insulin-positive cells suggests a hitherto uncharacterized large non-proliferative contribution."

In this issue of Cell Stem Cell, Esteban et al., 2010Esteban M.A. Wang T. Qin B. Yang J. Qin D. Cai J. Li W. Weng Z. Chen J. Ni S. et al.Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 6 (this issue): 71-79Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar report that vitamin C enhances the reprogramming efficiency of mouse and human fibroblasts transduced with three (Oct4/Klf4/Sox2) or four (Oct4/Klf4/Sox2/cMyc) factors. Vitamin C can alleviate cell senescence by p53 repression and may accelerate reprogramming by synergizing with epigenetic regulators. In this issue, Pei and colleagues reveal that a natural compound, vitamin C, can not only improve the efficiency of existing reprogramming protocols for both mouse and human somatic cells, including fibroblasts and nonfibroblasts, but may also promote the transition of partially reprogrammed induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to a fully reprogrammed state (Esteban et al., 2010Esteban M.A. Wang T.

Notably, in the three years since the first generation of iPSCs by Yamanaka's group in 2006 (Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006Takahashi K. Yamanaka S. Cell. 2006; 126: 663-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18857) Google Scholar), several small molecules and growth factors have been identified that greatly improve reprogramming efficiency (reviewed in Feng et al., 2009Feng B. Ng J.H. Heng J.C. Ng H.H. Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 4: 301-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) (Figure 1). Some of these molecules are epigenetic regulating factors such as valproic acid (VPA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor; BIX01294, an inhibitor of the G9a histone methyltransferase; RG108 and AZA, DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors; and Tranylcypromine, an inhibitor of lysine-specific demethylase 1 (Li et al., 2009Li W. Zhou H. Abujarour R. Zhu S. Joo J.Y. Lin T. Hao E. Scholer H.R. Hayek A. Ding S. Stem Cells. 2009; 27: 2992-3000PubMed Google Scholar). Other factors that have been shown to influence the reprogramming process function through cell-signaling pathways, including the Wnt signaling agonists Wnt3a or CHIR99021, the TGF-beta receptor antagonists SB431542 and E616452 (Woltjen and Stanford, 2009Woltjen K. Stanford W.L. Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 5: 457-458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), the MEK-ERK pathway antagonist PD0325901 (Li et al., 2009Li W. Zhou H. Abujarour R. Zhu S. Joo J.Y. Lin T. Hao E. Scholer H.R. Hayek A. Ding S. Stem Cells. 2009; 27: 2992-3000PubMed Google Scholar), and the L-type calcium channel agonist BayK8644. In addition, kenpaullone, an inhibitor of CDK and GSK3, has been reported to be able to substitute for KLF4 in iPSC generation, although its mechanism of action is not yet clear and might not be mediated by CDK or GSK3 (Lyssiotis et al., 2009Lyssiotis C.A. Foreman R.K. Staerk J. Garcia M. Mathur D. Markoulaki S. Hanna J. Lairson L.L. Charette B.D. Bouchez L.C. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 8912-8917Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). In contrast to the small molecules listed above, vitamin C is a natural compound and an essential nutrient that is vital to human health. The discovery of vitamin C as a reprogramming enhancer arose from a metabolic study of the reprogramming process. Pei's group first found that one of the important metabolic activities that occur during the early reprogramming process is a significant increase in the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in Oct4/Sox2/Klf4-transduced mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (Esteban et al., 2010Esteban M.A. Wang T. Qin B. Yang J. Qin D. Cai J. Li W. Weng Z. Chen J. Ni S. et al.Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 6 (this issue): 71-79Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar), which might induce senescence and cause the transduced cells to be more resistant to reprogramming. However, the inclusion of c-Myc in the cocktail led to a marked decrease in ROS levels and also correlated with an improvement in reprogramming efficiency. Moreover, several genes regulating the antioxidant cell response, such as superoxide dismutase 1 and 2, were also upregulated in the Oct4/Klf4/Sox2/cMyc-transduced MEF cells. These observations suggest that the antioxidant defense system might be an important metabolic regulation pathway for the early steps of the reprogramming process. However, after testing several antioxidants such as nacetylcysteine and resveratrol, the authors found that only vitamin C could improve iPSC generation, even in the presence of c-Myc, which suggests that the positive effect of vitamin C on reprogramming efficiency is probably independent of its function as an antioxidant. These results indicated that other biological mechanisms of vitamin C might be involved in upregulating reprogramming efficiency. Several recent studies have demonstrated that p53, a tumor-suppressor gene, plays critical roles in somatic cell reprogramming. The silencing of p53 could significantly increase the reprogramming efficiency of both mouse and human somatic cells (discussed in Deng, 2009Deng W. Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 5: 349-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Moreover, cell senescence, which is characterized by p53, p16INK4a, and p21CIP1 upregulation, impairs the successful reprogramming of somatic cells to pluripotent stem cells. Various results from the Esteban et al. study, such as an increase in cell proliferation and cell lifespan extension, suggest that vitamin C is able to overcome the senescence roadblock during the reprogramming process. Pei's group further showed that the alleviation of cell senescence by vitamin C may depend on reducing but not abolishing p53 and p21 expression levels in the fibroblasts transduced with Oct4/Klf4/Sox2 (Esteban et al., 2010Esteban M.A. Wang T. Qin B. Yang J. Qin D. Cai J. Li W. Weng Z. Chen J. Ni S. et al.Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 6 (this issue): 71-79Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that vitamin C can inhibit p53-induced senescence in human bladder cancer EJ cells, probably because of suppression of ROS production and p38 MAPK activity (Kim et al., 2008Kim J.E. Jin D.H. Lee S.D. Hong S.W. Shin J.S. Lee S.K. Jung D.J. Kang J.S. Lee W.J. Int. J. Mol. Med. 2008; 22: 651-655PubMed Google Scholar). Altogether, these findings suggest that the improvement in reprogramming efficiency mediated by vitamin C may result from alleviating cell senescence via p53 repression. Importantly, vitamin C doesn't seem to eliminate p53 expression entirely and thus the resulting iPSCs may harbor less oncogenic potential relative to p53 null pluripotent cell lines. Therefore, vitamin C may be a valuable addition to reprogramming cocktails as a safe, natural compound used for suppressing the p53 pathway and facilitating iPSC generation. This possibility needs to be confirmed by examining chromosome stability and tumorigenicity of the resulting cells. In addition, Esteban et al., 2010Esteban M.A. Wang T. Qin B. Yang J. Qin D. Cai J. Li W. Weng Z. Chen J. Ni S. et al.Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 6 (this issue): 71-79Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar showed that vitamin C could accelerate transcriptome changes that occur during the reprogramming process and also promote the conversion of partially reprogrammed iPSCs to fully reprogrammed iPSCs. Although an ERK inhibitor and a GSK3 inhibitor (also known as “2i’) were reported to have similar effects (reviewed in Feng et al., 2009Feng B. Ng J.H. Heng J.C. Ng H.H. Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 4: 301-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), vitamin C did not inhibit ERK activation in the reprogramming setting and thus probably functions through an alternate pathway. The Yamanaka lab recently reported that hypoxic conditions can also improve reprogramming efficiency for both mouse and human cells (Yoshida et al., 2009Yoshida Y. Takahashi K. Okita K. Ichisaka T. Yamanaka S. Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 5: 237-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). In their current work, Pei's group reveal that several hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) target genes are upregulated during the iPSC generation process and that expression of these genes is further increased with vitamin C treatment. It has been reported that the stabilization of HIFα and the activation of HIF transcriptional activity, which are the critical characteristics of the hypoxic state, are promoted by the inhibition of HIF-hydroxylase activity when cells are treated with ascorbate (Schofield and Ratcliffe, 2004Schofield C.J. Ratcliffe P.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 343-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (1611) Google Scholar). Collectively, these results suggest that vitamin C might improve reprogramming efficiency in part by functioning as an agonist for genes that are typically downstream of hypoxia. In addition, there is evidence to show that vitamin C could be a cofactor for histone demethylases such as JMJD1A, which demethylate specific amino acids in histone proteins such as histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9). It has been reported that an inhibitor of G9a (the major mammalian H3K9 methyltransferase), BIX01294, is able to improve reprogramming efficiency (reviewed in Feng et al., 2009Feng B. Ng J.H. Heng J.C. Ng H.H. Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 4: 301-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Therefore, vitamin C might also promote histone demethylation in order to improve the reprogramming efficiency of Oct4/KLF4/Sox2/cMyc or Oct4/KLF4/Sox2-transduced fibroblasts. In summary, Esteban et al., 2010Esteban M.A. Wang T. Qin B. Yang J. Qin D. Cai J. Li W. Weng Z. Chen J. Ni S. et al.Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 6 (this issue): 71-79Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar identified that vitamin C, a natural nutritional compound crucial for human health, plays an important role in promoting somatic cell reprogramming to pluripotency. Although the specific mechanism(s) responsible for the effect of vitamin C on reprogramming remains unclear, alleviation of cell senescence by vitamin C may synergize with its other biological functions, such as its function as an agonist for the HIF pathway and a cofactor for histone demethylases, and account for the improvement in the reprogramming efficiency (Figure 1). Altogether, this discovery of the effect of vitamin C on reprogramming not only sheds new light on the future study of reprogramming mechanism but also facilitates our ability to explore more efficient and safer methods to obtain fully reprogrammed iPSCs from somatic cells.

However, the low efficiency and slow kinetics of the reprogramming process have hampered progress with this technology. Here we report that a natural compound, vitamin C (Vc), enhances iPSC generation from both mouse and human somatic cells. Vc acts at least in part by alleviating cell senescence, a recently identified roadblock for reprogramming. In addition, Vc accelerates gene expression changes and promotes the transition of pre-iPSC colonies to a fully reprogrammed state. Full-Text PDF Open Archive"
https://openalex.org/W2026853479,"Background Factors associated with serologic hepatitis B virus (HBV) outcomes in HIV-infected individuals remain incompletely understood, yet such knowledge may lead to improvements in the prevention and treatment of chronic HBV infection. Methods and Findings HBV-HIV co-infected cohort participants were retrospectively analyzed. HBV serologic outcomes were classified as chronic, resolved, and isolated-HBcAb. Chronic HBV (CHBV) was defined as the presence of HBsAg on two or more occasions at least six months apart. Risk factors for HBV serologic outcome were assessed using logistic regression. Of 2037 participants with HBV infection, 281 (14%) had CHBV. Overall the proportions of HBV infections classified as CHBV were 11%, 16%, and 19% for CD4 cell count strata of ≥500, 200–499, and <200, respectively (p<0.0001). Risk of CHBV was increased for those with HBV infection occurring after HIV diagnosis (OR 2.62; 95% CI 1.78–3.85). This included the subset with CD4 count ≥500 cells/µL where 21% of those with HBV after HIV diagnosis had CHBV compared with 9% for all other cases of HBV infection in this stratum (p = 0.0004). Prior receipt of HAART was associated with improved HBV serologic outcome overall (p = 0.012), and specifically among those with HBV after HIV (p = 0.002). In those with HBV after HIV, HAART was associated with reduced risk of CHBV overall (OR 0.18; 95% CI 0.04–0.79); including reduced risk in the subsets with CD4 ≥350 cells/µL (p<0.001) and CD4 ≥500 cells/µL (p = 0.01) where no cases of CHBV were seen in those with a recent history of HAART use. Conclusions Clinical indicators of immunologic status in HIV-infected individuals, such as CD4 cell count, are associated with HBV serologic outcome. These data suggest that immunologic preservation through the increased use of HAART to improve functional anti-HBV immunity, whether by improved access to care or earlier initiation of therapy, would likely improve HBV infection outcomes in HIV-infected individuals."

These findings provide new insight into the network of transcription factors and miRNAs that regulate cancer stem cells. Treatment of human cancers is complicated because the majority of cancers become metastatic and/or develop resistance to therapy. Two concepts that may explain tumor progression and acquisition of a therapy-resistant phenotype have received wide attention. In the first concept, tumor cells gain an invasive phenotype by a process that resembles the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) found during embryonic development and wound healing. During EMT, cells change morphology, lose polarity, and become mobile. The second concept is based on the recognition that many human cancers contain a rare population of cells that exhibit stem cell properties and drive neoplastic growth. Recent data have connected the two concepts in breast cancer by demonstrating that induction of EMT in both mammary epithelial cells as well as in breast cancer cells causes upregulation of stem cell markers (Mani et al., 2008Mani S.A. Guo W. Liao M.J. Eaton E.N. Ayyanan A. Zhou A.Y. Brooks M. Reinhard F. Zhang C.C. Shipitsin M. et al.Cell. 2008; 133: 704-715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6215) Google Scholar). Conversely, EMT markers were found to be enriched in stem cells isolated from either mammary glands or mammary carcinomas. miRNAs have emerged as powerful regulators of differentiation, and a number of miRNAs have been shown to be either highly expressed or excluded from stem cells. miRNAs that are highly expressed in stem cells include the miR-302∼371 cluster; expression of miR-302 alone in human skin cancer cells induced a phenotype that included properties of pluripotent embryonic stem cells (Lin et al., 2008Lin S.L.

Recently, members of the miR-200 family of miRNAs (miR-200a, -200b, -200c, -141, and -429) were recognized to be regulators of the epithelial phenotype and, hence, to be regulators of EMT (Gregory et al., 2008aGregory P.A.

Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 593-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (2942) Google Scholar, Park et al., 2008Park S.M. Gaur A.B. Lengyel E. Peter M.E. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 894-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (1749) Google Scholar). miR-200 was shown to target two E-box-binding inhibitors of E-cadherin, ZEB1 and ZEB2, raising the question as to what mechanism regulates expression of miR-200 family members. Subsequently, both ZEB1 and ZEB2 were reported to be part of a double-negative feedback loop, in that they participate in the repression of the expression of all five miR-200 family members (Gregory et al., 2008bGregory P.A. Bracken C.P. Bert A.G. Goodall G.J. Cell Cycle. 2008; 7: 3112-3118Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Given that miR-200 is a powerful regulator of EMT, and because EMT has been connected to the regulation of stemness, it seemed merely a question of when, not if, someone would demonstrate that miR-200 regulates the emergence of stem cells and cancer stem cells, in addition to EMT. To this end, Clarke and colleagues recently identified a set of miRNAs that are not expressed in either mammary epithelial stem cells or in enriched breast cancer stem cells (Shimono et al., 2009Shimono Y. Zabala M. Cho R.W. Lobo N. Dalerba P. Qian D. Diehn M. Liu H. Panula S.P. Chiao E. et al.Cell. 2009; 138: 592-603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). Further, the authors identified and validated that the stem cell factor BMI1 is a target for the miR-200 family of miRNAs. Overexpression of miR-200c, either in normal stem cells or in cancer stem cells, reduced their clonogenic and tumor-initiating activities. The Shimono et al. findings raise additional questions. First, is BMI1 the only stem cell-relevant target of miR-200? It seemed unlikely that miR-200 would exert its function by targeting only one gene, especially given that both ZEB1 and ZEB2 were known to be efficiently targeted by miR-200. Second, what prevents miR-200 expression in stem cells, but not more differentiated progeny? In a report from a recent issue of Nature Cell Biology, Wellner et al., 2009Wellner U. Schubert J. Burk U.C. Schmalhofer O. Zhu F. Sonntag A. Waldvogel B. Vannier C. Darling D. Hausen A.Z. et al.Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 1487-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar offers some answers to these questions and provides further evidence of an miRNA-mediated connection between EMT and cancer stem cells. The authors demonstrated that ZEB1 is preferentially expressed in the invasive front of pancreatic cancer samples, similar to their previous finding in colon cancer (Spaderna et al., 2006Spaderna S. Schmalhofer O. Hlubek F. Berx G. Eger A. Merkel S. Jung A. Kirchner T. Brabletz T. Gastroenterology. 2006; 131: 830-840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Consequently, knockdown of ZEB1 in pancreatic cancer cell lines reduced both invasion and metastasis in an orthotopic mouse xenograft model. In addition, knockdown of ZEB1 also caused a reduction in tumorigenicity of the cancer cells, based on the size and number of tumors that formed in recipients, even under serial dilution conditions. Other traits attributed to cancer stem cells were also diminished, including the frequency of CD24-positive cells (a marker for pancreatic cancer stem cells), the ability to form spheres in culture, and chemoresistance. Furthermore, expression of a number of miRNAs was affected in these cells. Most notably, members of three miRNA gene clusters were upregulated in ZEB1 knockdown cells. They included two members of the miR-200 family, miR-183 and miR-203. Interestingly, all three miRNA clusters carry E-boxes in their promoters and were found to be repressed by ZEB1. In line with the predicted function, expression of both miR-203 and miR-183 decreased the sphere-forming capacity of pancreatic cancer cells. Consistent with the recent work by Shimono et al., 2009Shimono Y. Zabala M. Cho R.W. Lobo N. Dalerba P. Qian D. Diehn M. Liu H. Panula S.P. Chiao E. et al.Cell. 2009; 138: 592-603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar on breast cancer and normal stem cells, both miR-200 and members of the miR-183-96-182 cluster were also identified as regulating cancer stem cells in pancreatic cancer, suggesting a mechanism that is not restricted to one cancer type. BMI1 was confirmed as a major target of miR-200 regulating cancer stem cells. However, BMI1 was also found to contain seed matches for two other miRNAs in its 3′ UTR, and it was experimentally validated as a target for miR-200, miR-183, and miR-203. Remarkably, evidence was provided to suggest that other pluripotency factors such as Sox2 and Klf4 are also targets of miR-200, pointing at a complex network of multiple miRNAs that influence stem cell regulators, with ZEB1 at the center of multiple negative feedback loops (Figure 1). Although the Wellner study focused on ZEB1, it is likely that ZEB2 has similar activity, given that both ZEB1 and ZEB2 bind to E-boxes in the promoters of the two miR-200 gene clusters (Gregory et al., 2008bGregory P.A. Bracken C.P. Bert A.G. Goodall G.J. Cell Cycle. 2008; 7: 3112-3118Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Not all human cancers contain cancer stem cells. However, the data on the parallels on the roles of miRNAs in normal tissue stem cells and cancer stem cells are consistent with the existence of cancer stem cells in breast, colon, and pancreatic cancer and point at widely overlapping signaling pathways that regulate differentiation and maintenance of both populations. In addition, this work has reinforced the notion that miRNAs often act as part of negative feedback loops. Thus, targeting a combination of protein and RNA components of these loops could open up novel therapeutic opportunities for many cancers that resist conventional treatment."

Rearrangements of the EVI1 locus are often associated with monosomy 7 or cytogenetic detectable deletions of part of 7q. As EVI1 overexpression alone is not sufficient to induce leukemia, loss of a 7q tumour suppressor gene might be a required cooperating event. To test this hypothesis, we performed high-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization analysis of twelve EVI1 overexpressing patients and three EVI1 deregulated cell lines to search for 7q submicroscopic deletions. This analysis lead to the delineation of two critical regions, one of 0.39 Mb on 7q35 containing the CNTNAP2 gene and one of 1.33 Mb on chromosome bands 7q35–q36 comprising nine genes in EVI1 deregulated cell lines. These findings open the way to further studies aimed at identifying the culprit EVI1 implicated tumour suppressor genes on 7q."
https://openalex.org/W1984706399,"The vernalization gene 2 (VRN2), is a major flowering repressor in temperate cereals that is regulated by low temperature and photoperiod. Here we show that the gene from Triticum aestivum (TaVRN2) is also regulated by salt, heat shock, dehydration, wounding and abscissic acid. Promoter analysis indicates that TaVRN2 regulatory region possesses all the specific responsive elements to these stresses. This suggests pleiotropic effects of TaVRN2 in wheat development and adaptability to the environment. To test if TaVRN2 can act as a flowering repressor in species different from the temperate cereals, the gene was ectopically expressed in the model plant Arabidopsis. Transgenic plants showed no alteration in morphology, but their flowering time was significantly delayed compared to controls plants, indicating that TaVRN2, although having no ortholog in Brassicaceae, can act as a flowering repressor in these species. To identify the possible mechanism by which TaVRN2 gene delays flowering in Arabidopsis, the expression level of several genes involved in flowering time regulation was determined. The analysis indicates that the late flowering of the 35S::TaVRN2 plants was associated with a complex pattern of expression of the major flowering control genes, FCA, FLC, FT, FVE and SOC1. This suggests that heterologous expression of TaVRN2 in Arabidopsis can delay flowering by modulating several floral inductive pathways. Furthermore, transgenic plants showed higher freezing tolerance, likely due to the accumulation of CBF2, CBF3 and the COR genes. Overall, our data suggests that TaVRN2 gene could modulate a common regulator of the two interacting pathways that regulate flowering time and the induction of cold tolerance. The results also demonstrate that TaVRN2 could be used to manipulate flowering time and improve cold tolerance in other species."

https://openalex.org/W2071852132,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) may be biased by population stratification (PS). We conducted empirical quantification of the magnitude of PS among human populations and its impact on GWAS. Liver tissues were collected from 979, 59 and 49 Caucasian Americans (CA), African Americans (AA) and Hispanic Americans (HA), respectively, and genotyped using Illumina650Y (Ilmn650Y) arrays. RNA was also isolated and hybridized to Agilent whole-genome gene expression arrays. We propose a new method (i.e., hgdp-eigen) for detecting PS by projecting genotype vectors for each sample to the eigenvector space defined by the Human Genetic Diversity Panel (HGDP). Further, we conducted GWAS to map expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) for the ∼40,000 liver gene expression traits monitored by the Agilent arrays. HGDP-eigen performed similarly to the conventional self-eigen methods in capturing PS. However, leveraging the HGDP offered a significant advantage in revealing the origins, directions and magnitude of PS. Adjusting for eigenvectors had minor impacts on eQTL detection rates in CA. In contrast, for AA and HA, adjustment dramatically reduced association findings. At an FDR = 10%, we identified 65 eQTLs in AA with the unadjusted analysis, but only 18 eQTLs after the eigenvector adjustment. Strikingly, 55 out of the 65 unadjusted AA eQTLs were validated in CA, indicating that the adjustment procedure significantly reduced GWAS power. A number of the 55 AA eQTLs validated in CA overlapped with published disease associated SNPs. For example, rs646776 and rs10903129 have previously been associated with lipid levels and coronary heart disease risk, however, the rs10903129 eQTL was missed in the eigenvector adjusted analysis."

Covalent modification of histones is central in regulation of gene expression in metazoans. The Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), which trimethylates histone H3 on lysine 27 (H3K27me3), is necessary for the correct spatio-temporal maintenance of silencing at genes involved in developmental patterning, morphogenesis, and organogenesis. The core subunits of mammalian PRC2—enhancer of zeste (Ezh2), the lysine methyltransferase (KMT), and embryonic ectoderm development (Eed) and suppressor of zeste 12 (Suz12), associated proteins that are essential for its enzymatic activity—exist in multiple complexes (Simon and Kingston, 2009Simon J.A. Kingston R.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 697-708Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the composition and function of the different PRC2 complexes have yet to be fully elucidated. In a recent issue of Cell, papers from the Wysocka and Orkin labs provide a surprising new insight into one PRC2 complex (Peng et al., 2009Peng J. Valouev A. Swigut T. Zhang J. Zhao Y. Sidow A. Wysocka J. Cell. 2009; 139: 1290-1302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, Shen et al., 2009Shen X. Kim W. Fujiwara Y. Simon M.D. Lui Y. Mysliwiec M.R. Yuan G.-C. Lee Y. Orkin S.H. Cell. 2009; 139: 1303-1314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Both groups show that a fraction of PRC2 associates with Jarid2/Jumonji (Jarid2), which inhibits PRC2's KMT and silencing activities. They suggest that Jarid2 fine-tunes the degree of Polycomb-mediated silencing and thereby can influence cell-fate decisions. Peng et al. and Shen et al. affinity-purified PRC2 from mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) by employing tagged core subunits and found that PRC2 associates with Jarid2 (Peng et al., 2009Peng J. Valouev A. Swigut T. Zhang J. Zhao Y. Sidow A. Wysocka J. Cell. 2009; 139: 1290-1302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, Shen et al., 2009Shen X. Kim W. Fujiwara Y.

In addition, genome-wide localization analyses showed that Jarid2 is found at the vast majority of sites bound by PRC2 in ESCs. Together, these data suggest that a significant fraction of PRC2 is associated with Jarid2 in ESCs. Jarid2 is the founding member of the Jumonji C (Jmjc) domain family. Jmjc domains are characteristic of proteins that remove methyl groups, the lysine demethylases (KDMs) (Lan et al., 2008Lan F. Nottke A.C. Shi Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2008; 20: 316-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Jarid2 is unusual among Jmjc proteins in that it lacks crucial residues for cofactor binding and is a catalytically inactive KDM (Lan et al., 2008Lan F. Nottke A.C. Shi Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2008; 20: 316-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, Shen et al., 2009Shen X. Kim W. Fujiwara Y. Simon M.D. Lui Y. Mysliwiec M.R. Yuan G.-C. Lee Y. Orkin S.H. Cell. 2009; 139: 1303-1314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). The association of KMT and KDM complexes is thought to be important in maintaining chromatin in an on or off state. For example, KMTs that modify histone H3 on lysine 4 (H3K4me), a mark associated with gene activation, associate with the H3K27 KDM, thereby coupling the addition of an activating mark with the removal of a silencing mark (Swigut and Wysocka, 2007Swigut T. Wysocka J. Cell. 2007; 131: 29-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Similarly, Jarid1a, a H3K4 KDM, is reported to associate with PRC2 (Pasini et al., 2008Pasini D. Hansen K.H. Christensen J. Agger K. Cloos P.A. Helin K. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 1345-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). However, Jarid2 is substantially more abundant than Jarid1a in ESCs and PRC2-Jarid2 is the predominant KMT-Jmjc complex in ESCs. It may be that the association of PRC2 with Jarid2 is one of the reasons that many of the genes silenced by PRC2 in ESCs contain both H3K27me3 and H3K4me3, a combination of silencing and active marks that is thought to be central in keeping these genes poised for expression in the future (Bernstein et al., 2006Bernstein B.E. Mikkelsen T.S. Xie X. Kamal M. Huebert D.J. Cuff J. Fry B. Meissner A. Wernig M. Plath K. et al.Cell. 2006; 125: 315-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3738) Google Scholar). Peng et al. and Shen et al. provide several lines of evidence to indicate that Jarid2 functions as more than just a catalytically inactive KDM. First, Jarid2 is necessary for normal levels of PRC2 association with its target genes. This requirement is mutual, given that Jarid2 binding was also decreased in PRC2 mutant cells. Second, Jarid2 inhibits PRC2 H3K27 KMT activity in vitro. Third, Jarid2 mutant ESCs exhibit increased H3K27me3 levels at PRC2 targets, despite decreased occupancy of PRC2. Furthermore, whereas PRC2-bound genes are upregulated in PRC2 mutant ESCs, these genes are downregulated in Jarid2 mutant ESCs. Finally, whereas gene expression changes in differentiating PRC2 mutant ESCs are indicative of accelerated differentiation, differentiating Jarid2 mutant ESCs exhibit gene expression changes consistent with delayed differentiation. A similar trend was observed in vivo, when the Xenopus Jarid2 homolog was depleted during frog early embryogenesis. Thus, Jarid2 promotes association of PRC2 with its target genes while simultaneously inhibiting PRC2 enzymatic activity and attenuating silencing, which in turn promotes expression of differentiation-specific genes. The precise mechanism by which Jarid2 inhibits PRC2 activity is not known. However, Jarid2 directly interacts with Suz12 in vitro (Peng et al., 2009Peng J. Valouev A. Swigut T. Zhang J. Zhao Y. Sidow A. Wysocka J. Cell. 2009; 139: 1290-1302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar), suggesting that it may interfere with the function of this essential PRC2 subunit. The PRC2-Jarid2 complex is not likely to be the only flavor of PRC2 complex. Jarid2 and PRC2 cofractionate in high-molecular-weight complexes on glycerol gradients; however, there were lower-molecular-weight PRC2 complexes that lacked Jarid2 (Peng et al., 2009Peng J. Valouev A. Swigut T. Zhang J. Zhao Y. Sidow A. Wysocka J. Cell. 2009; 139: 1290-1302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Shen et al. also show that PRC2 interacts with metal response element-binding transcription factor (Mtf2) (Shen et al., 2009Shen X. Kim W. Fujiwara Y. Simon M.D. Lui Y. Mysliwiec M.R. Yuan G.-C. Lee Y. Orkin S.H. Cell. 2009; 139: 1303-1314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), one of three mammalian homologs of Drosophila Polycomblike (Pcl), which binds fly PRC2 and stimulates its activity (Nekrasov et al., 2007Nekrasov M. Klymenko T. Fraterman S. Papp B. Oktaba K. Kocher T. Cohen A. Stunnenberg H.G. Wilm M. Muller J. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 4078-4088Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). PRC2-Jarid2 and PRC2-Mtf2 are likely to be distinct complexes because Jarid2 and Mtf2 do not copurify. Why are there so many different PRC2-containing complexes? One possibility is that the degree of silencing must be exquisitely controlled to achieve developmentally correct transitions in gene expression patterns as cells differentiate. If PRC2 activity is very high, as is the case in Jarid2 mutant ESCs, then the strength of any developmental signaling pathways that turn on PRC2-silenced genes may not be sufficient to reliably induce expression of their targets. When PRC2 activity is low, as in Eed or Suz12 mutants, target genes are no longer reliably silenced, and such a result can lead to incorrect execution of developmental programs (Chamberlain et al., 2008Chamberlain S.J. Yee D. Magnuson T. Stem Cells. 2008; 26: 1496-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, Pasini et al., 2007Pasini D. Bracken A.P. Hansen J.B. Capillo M. Helin K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 3769-3779Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Indeed, Eed mutant ESCs are prone to differentiation in culture, suggesting that PRC2 is necessary for ESCs to robustly carry out the self-renewal program. Thus, one possibility is that the ratio of different PRC2 complexes occupying each target gene may be important in determining whether a signaling pathway will trigger maintenance of or release from silencing, thus allowing cells to silence or upregulate a subset of PRC2 targets in response to particular developmental cues. The near-perfect overlap between Jarid2 and PRC2 in ESCs argues that it is not simply the presence or absence of Jarid2 that regulates PRC2 target gene activity. However, in addition to Jarid2 and Mtf2 and other Pcl homologs, there are several other sources of variability between PRC2 complexes (Simon and Kingston, 2009Simon J.A. Kingston R.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 697-708Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Specifically, there are two related genes encoding H3K27 KMTs, Ezh2 and Ezh1, both of which associate with Eed and Suz12 and there are four isoforms of Eed that differ in their N-termini because of alternative translation-start-site usage. Thus, there is potential for considerable combinatorial complexity of PRC2 complexes. Once the composition and activities of different PRC2 complexes is determined, and the factors that direct these different complexes to their target genes are identified, it may be possible to fully understand how PRC2 is utilized to control so many genes in such a wide variety of developmental contexts.

Genome-wide ChIP-seq analyses of Jarid2, Ezh2, and Suz12 binding reveal that Jarid2 and PRC2 occupy the same genomic regions.

https://openalex.org/W1979940230,"Philologists reconstructing ancient texts from variously miscopied manuscripts anticipated information theorists by centuries in conceptualizing information in terms of probability. An example is the editorial principle difficilior lectio potior (DLP): in choosing between otherwise acceptable alternative wordings in different manuscripts, ""the more difficult reading [is] preferable."" As philologists at least as early as Erasmus observed (and as information theory's version of the second law of thermodynamics would predict), scribal errors tend to replace less frequent and hence entropically more information-rich wordings with more frequent ones. Without measurements, it has been unclear how effectively DLP has been used in the reconstruction of texts, and how effectively it could be used. We analyze a case history of acknowledged editorial excellence that mimics an experiment: the reconstruction of Lucretius's De Rerum Natura, beginning with Lachmann's landmark 1850 edition based on the two oldest manuscripts then known. Treating words as characters in a code, and taking the occurrence frequencies of words from a current, more broadly based edition, we calculate the difference in entropy information between Lachmann's 756 pairs of grammatically acceptable alternatives. His choices average 0.26+/-0.20 bits higher in entropy information (95% confidence interval, P = 0.005), as against the single bit that determines the outcome of a coin toss, and the average 2.16+/-0.10 bits (95%) of (predominantly meaningless) entropy information if the rarer word had always been chosen. As a channel width, 0.26+/-0.20 bits/word corresponds to a 0.790.79(+0.09) (-0.15) likelihood of the rarer word being the one accepted in the reference edition, which is consistent with the observed 547/756 = 0.72+/-0.03 (95%). Statistically informed application of DLP can recover substantial amounts of semantically meaningful entropy information from noise; hence the extension copiosior informatione lectio potior, ""the reading richer in information [is] preferable."" New applications of information theory promise continued refinement in the reconstruction of culturally fundamental texts."
