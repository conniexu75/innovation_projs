https://openalex.org/W2063110155,"The molecular specificity of the receptors for steroid and thyroid hormones is achieved by their selective interaction with DNA binding sites referred to as hormone response elements (HREs). HREs can differ in primary nucleotide sequence as well as in the spacing of their dyadic half-sites. The target gene specificity of the glucocorticoid receptor can be converted to that of the estrogen receptor by changing three amino acids clustered in the first zinc finger. Remarkably, a single Gly to Glu change in this region produces a receptor that recognizes both glucocorticoid and estrogen response elements. Further replacement of five amino acids in the stem of the second zinc finger transforms the specificity to that of the thyroid hormone receptor. These findings localize structural determinants required for discrimination of HRE sequence and half-site spacing, respectively, and suggest a simple pathway for the coevolution of receptor DNA binding domains and hormone-responsive gene networks."
https://openalex.org/W1575228817,"The results presented in this paper indicate that the phi 29 DNA polymerase is the only enzyme required for efficient synthesis of full length phi 29 DNA with the phi 29 terminal protein, the initiation primer, as the only additional protein requirement. Analysis of phi 29 DNA polymerase activity in various in vitro DNA replication systems indicates that two main reasons are responsible for the efficiency of this minimal system: 1) the phi 29 DNA polymerase is highly processive in the absence of any accessory protein; 2) the polymerase itself is able to produce strand displacement coupled to the polymerization process. Using primed M13 DNA as template, the phi 29 DNA polymerase is able to synthesize DNA chains greater than 70 kilobase pairs. Furthermore, conditions that increase the stability of secondary structure in the template do not affect the processivity and strand displacement ability of the enzyme. Thus, the catalytic properties of the phi 29 DNA polymerase are appropriate for a phi 29 DNA replication mechanism involving two replication origins, strand displacement and continuous synthesis of both strands. The enzymology of phi 29 DNA replication would support a symmetrical model of DNA replication."
https://openalex.org/W2002285090,"Formation of anterior structures in the Drosophila embryo requires the product of the gene bicoid. The bicoid protein contains a homeodomain and may exert its effects in early development by regulating transcription of the gap gene, hunchback (hb). Consistent with this view, we have demonstrated that DNA-bound Bicoid fusion proteins stimulate gene expression. We used the gene activation phenotype in yeast to study DNA recognition by the Bicoid homeodomain. We found that a single amino acid replacement at position 9 of the recognition helix was sufficient to switch the DNA specificity of the Bicoid protein. The altered specificity Bicoid mutants recognized DNA sites bound by Ultrabithorax, fushi tarazu, and other related homeo-domain proteins. Our results suggest that DNA specificity in Bicoid and Antennapedia class proteins is determined by recognition helix residue 9."

Porcine endothelial cells expressing recombinant β-galactosidase from a murine amphotropic retroviral vector were introduced with a catheter into denuded iliofemoral arteries of syngeneic animals. Arterial segments explanted 2 to 4 weeks later contained endothelial cells expressing β-galactosidase, an indication that they were successfully implanted on the vessel wall."

https://openalex.org/W2077254097,"Genetic engineering of livestock is expected to have a major effect on the agricultural industry. However, accurate assessment of the consequences of transgene expression is impossible without multigenerational studies. A systematic study of the beneficial and adverse consequences of long-term elevations in the plasma levels of bovine growth hormone (bGH) was conducted on two lines of transgenic pigs. Two successive generations of pigs expressing the bGH gene showed significant improvements in both daily weight gain and feed efficiency and exhibited changes in carcass composition that included a marked reduction in subcutaneous fat. However, long-term elevation of bGH was generally detrimental to health: the pigs had a high incidence of gastric ulcers, arthritis, cardiomegaly, dermatitis, and renal disease. The ability to produce pigs exhibiting only the beneficial, growth-promoting effects of growth hormone by a transgenic approach may require better control of transgene expression, a different genetic background, or a modified husbandry regimen."
https://openalex.org/W2068609431,"The specificity of target gene activation by steroid receptors is encoded within a small, cysteine-rich domain that is believed to form two zinc-coordinated fingers. Here we show that the ability of glucocorticoid and estrogen receptors to discriminate between their closely related response elements resides in the two amino acids located between the two cysteines in the C-terminal half of the first finger. Unexpectedly, chimeric glucocorticoid receptors harboring portions of the interfinger and/or second finger of the estrogen receptor have the ability to activate transcription from either a GRE- or ERE-containing promoter. We surmise that whereas the ""knuckle"" region of the first finger may be the primary determinant of sequence recognition, the remainder of the DNA binding domain normally confers structural information required for preventing promiscuous HRE recognition."

https://openalex.org/W2012412628,"The ZFX gene on the human X chromosome is structurally similar to the ZFY gene, which may constitute the sex-determining signal on the human Y chromosome. ZFY and ZFX diverged from a common ancestral gene, as evidenced by similarities in their intron/exon organization and exon DNA sequences. The carboxy-terminal exons of ZFY and ZFX both encode 13 zinc fingers; 383 of 393 amino acid residues are identical, and there are no insertions or deletions. Thus, the ZFY and ZFX proteins may bind to the same nucleic acid sequences. ZFY and ZFX are transcribed in a wide variety of XY and (in the case of ZFX) XX cell lines. Transcription analysis of human-rodent hybrid cell lines containing ""inactive"" human X chromosomes suggests that ZFX escapes X inactivation. This result contradicts the ""dosage/X-inactivation"" model, which postulated that sex is determined by the total amount of functionally interchangeable ZFY and ZFX proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1641384127,"The presence of a unique opal suppressor seryl-tRNA in higher vertebrates which is converted to phosphoseryl-tRNA has been known for several years, but its function has been uncertain (see Hatfield, D. (1985) Trends Biochem. Sci. 10, 201-204 for review). In the present study, we demonstrate that this tRNA species also occurs in vivo as selenocysteyl-tRNA(Ser) suggesting that it functions both as a carrier molecule upon which selenocysteine is synthesized and as a direct selenocysteine donor to a growing polypeptide chain in response to specific UGA codons. [75Se]Seleno[3H]cysteyl-tRNA(Ser) formed by administering 75Se and [3H]serine to rat mammary tumor cells (TMT-081-MS) in culture was isolated from the cell extract. The amino acid attached to the tRNA was identified as selenocysteine following its deacylation and reaction with iodoacetate and 3-bromopropionate. The resulting alkyl derivatives co-chromatographed on an amino acid analyzer with authentic carboxymethylselenocysteine and carboxyethylselenocysteine. Seryl-tRNA(Ser) and phosphoseryl-tRNA(Ser) (Hatfield, D., Diamond, A., and Dudock, B. (1982) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 79, 6215-6219), which co-migrate on a reverse phase chromatographic column with selenocysteyl-tRNA(Ser), were also identified in extracts of TMT-018-MS cells. Hence, we propose that a metabolic pathway for selenocysteine synthesis in mammalian cells is the conversion of seryl-tRNA(Ser) via phosphoseryl-tRNA(Ser) to selenocysteyl-tRNA(Ser). In a ribosomal binding assay selenocysteyl-tRNA(Ser) recognizes UGA but not any of the serine codons. Selenocysteyl-tRNA(Ser) is deacylated more readily than seryl-tRNA(Ser) (i.e. 58% deacylation during 15 min at pH 8.0 and 37 degrees C as compared to 41%)."
https://openalex.org/W1574428487,"It has recently been demonstrated that the chemotactic peptide N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe activates phospholipase D (PLD) in dimethyl sulfoxide-differentiated HL-60 granulocytes to produce phosphatidic acid (PA) and, in the presence of ethanol, phosphatidylethanol (PEt) (Pai, J.-K., Siegel, M. I., Egan, R. W., and Billah, M. M. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 12472-12477). We now report that biologically active phorbol esters, a cell-permeable diacylglycerol, 1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol (OAG), and calcium ionophore A23187 are also potent inducers of PLD in these HL-60 granulocytes. HL-60 granulocytes have been selectively labeled in 1-O-alkyl-2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (alkyl-PC) with 32P by incubating the cells with alkyl-[32P]lyso-phosphatidylcholine (PC). When these labeled cells are treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate, OAG, or A23187, alkyl-[32P]PA is formed. Because cellular ATP has not been labeled with 32P, the formation of alkyl-[32P]PA conclusively demonstrates PLD activation by these agents. In the presence of 0.5% ethanol, phorbol esters, OAG, and A23187 also induce formation of alkyl-[32P]PEt, demonstrating that the activated PLD catalyzes transphosphatidylation between the phosphatidyl moiety of the alkyl-[32P]PC and ethanol. Formation of alkyl-[32P]PA and alkyl-[32P]PEt in response to these various agents occurs in a time- and dose-dependent manner and exhibits differential Ca2+ requirements. Based on experiments with both [3H]alkyl-PC and alkyl-[32P]PC, it is concluded that alkyl-PA and alkyl-PEt formed in response to PMA, OAG, or A23187 are derived exclusively from PLD action on alkyl-PC. Furthermore, subthreshold concentrations of PMA (0.5-2.0 nM) or OAG (1.0-25 microM) combined with subthreshold levels of A23187 (15-60 nM) induce the formation of alkyl-[32P]PA and alkyl-[32P]PEt, suggesting that receptor-mediated activation of PLD might involve cooperative interactions between Ca2+ and diglyceride. Although PLD is activated by agents that also activate protein kinase C, the protein kinase C inhibitor, K252a, inhibits PMA-induced protein phosphorylation but causes only partial inhibition of PLD activation. We conclude that phorbol esters, OAG, and A23187 activate PLD in HL-60 granulocytes via protein kinase-independent as well as protein kinase-dependent mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1567905687,"Cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEs) synthesize and secrete type 1 plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1), an Mr 50,000 glycoprotein which inhibits both urokinase and tissue-type plasminogen activators. The synthesis of PAI-1 in BAEs is positively regulated by a variety of agents. To elucidate the mechanisms which govern expression of the PAI-1 gene, total cytoplasmic RNA was prepared from BAEs and analyzed by Northern blotting using a 1.3-kilobase (kb) human PAI-1 cDNA probe. Hybridization under conditions of high stringency revealed two bovine PAI-1 RNA species, 3.0 and 1.6 kb in length. The ratio of the two species was approximately 4:1. The 3.0-kb mRNA was bound by oligo(dT)-cellulose, whereas the 1.6-kb form was not, suggesting that the latter form lacked a poly(A) terminus. Treatment of BAEs with transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) markedly enhanced the steady-state levels of both RNA species. In each case, increases were detectable within 1 h, and maximal effects (i.e. greater than 30-fold increase) were observed between 6 and 18 h of treatment, followed by a decline to near-basal levels by 48 h. The response to each of these agents was dose-dependent, with maximal induction observed at concentrations of 10 ng/ml TGF-beta, 10 ng/ml LPS, and 25 ng/ml TNF-alpha. Induction of PAI-1 mRNA by these agents was not blocked by the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, suggesting that de novo protein synthesis was not required. In fact, treatment with cycloheximide (2 micrograms/ml) alone also increased PAI-1 mRNA levels. Treatment with cycloheximide in combination with TGF-beta, LPS, or TNF-alpha further enhanced the accumulation of PAI-1 mRNA. Nuclear transcription run-on experiments indicated that these agents elevated the rate of PAI-1 gene transcription 20-30-fold and that gene template activity was temporally correlated with the accumulation of PAI-1 mRNA. These data are consistent with the conclusion that the observed increases in PAI-1 steady-state mRNA levels result from primary effects of these agents on the rate of PAI-1 gene transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1542431794,"Increases in the transcription of genes important to cell growth frequently occur in concert with increases in intracellular polyamines after a mitogenic stimulus. Previously, we have shown that depletion of intracellular polyamines by 2-difluoromethylornithine in COLO 320 cells resulted in a significant decrease in c-myc mRNA steady state levels. We demonstrate here that polyamines have a predominant role in the regulation of transcription of c-myc, c-fos, and histone 2A, while they appear to have both a transcriptional and post-transcriptional role in expression of c-myb, ornithine decarboxylase, and beta-actin mRNA levels. We further analyzed the effect of spermidine in overall and specific RNA transcription in isolated nuclei from COLO 320 cells. In nuclei from control cells, the addition of spermidine resulted in a 3-4 increase in overall [alpha-32P]UTP incorporation and a 4-8-fold increase in c-myc, c-fos, and histone 2A transcription. In contrast, ornithine decarboxylase and c-myb gene transcription were unaffected. Furthermore, in nuclei from 2-difluoromethylornithine-treated COLO 320 cells, spermidine addition resulted in less than a 2-fold increase in RNA transcription and had no effect on any specific gene analyzed. These results indicate that polyamines may have an important role in the transcription of specific growth related genes, especially c-myc and c-fos, and this role may be one mechanism by which polyamines modulate cell growth."

https://openalex.org/W1558653051,"Activation of the Hageman factor-kallikrein-kinin system by serratial 56-kDa proteinase was previously demonstrated (Matsumoto, K., Yamamoto, T., Kamata, T., and Maeda, H. (1984) J. Biochem. (Tokyo) 96, 739-749; Kamata, R., Yamamoto, T., Matsumoto, K., and Maeda, H. (1985) Infect. Immun. 48, 747-753). To investigate whether the activation of the system is specific for 56-kDa proteinase or is found similarly with other microbial proteinases, 11 proteinases of microbial origins were studied; the 56-kDa proteinase was the control. For in vitro studies, activation of guinea pig Hageman factor and prekallikrein was examined in purified systems as well as in plasma as a zymogen source. Specific antibodies and inhibitors confirmed the activation steps of the cascade. In the in vivo study the enhancement of vascular permeability in guinea pig skin and its sensitivity to inhibitors of activated Hageman factor, plasma kallikrein, or a kininase were examined. The results from the in vivo experiments were consistent with those in vitro. Taking all the data together, we classified the 11 microbial proteinases into three groups as follows: 1) Serratia marcescens 56-, 60-, and 73-kDa proteinases, Pseudomonas aeruginosa alkaline proteinase and elastase, and Aspergillus melleus proteinase (this group activated Hageman factor but not prekallikrein); 2) Vibrio vulnificus proteinase, subtilisin from Bacillus subtilis, and thermolysin from Bacillus stearothermophilus (this group activated both Hageman factor and prekallikrein); 3) Streptomyces caespitosus proteinase and V8 proteinase from Staphylococcus aureus (this group activated neither Hageman factor nor prekallikrein, but generated kinin from high molecular weight kininogen directly)."
https://openalex.org/W1965404955,"Guanine nucleotide binding proteins (G proteins) that transduce signals from cell surface receptors to effector molecules are made up of three subunits, alpha, beta, and gamma. A complementary DNA clone that encodes a 71-amino acid protein was isolated from bovine brain; this protein contains peptide sequences that were derived from the purified gamma subunit of Gi and Go. The primary sequence of this G protein gamma subunit (G gamma) has 55 percent homology to the gamma subunit of transducin (T gamma) and also has homology to functional domains of mammalian ras proteins. The probe for isolating the clone was generated with the use of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The extent of divergence between T gamma and G gamma, the isolation of homologous PCR-generated fragments, and the differences between the predicted amino acid sequence of G gamma and that derived from the gamma subunit of Gi and Go indicate that gamma subunits are encoded by a family of genes."
https://openalex.org/W1586389918,"In an attempt to question the toxic effect of heat shock and related stress, we have studied the activity of reporter enzymes during stress. Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase and Photinus pyralis luciferase were synthesized in mouse and Drosophila cells after transfection of the corresponding genes. Both enzymes are rapidly inactivated during hyperthermia. The corresponding polypeptides are not degraded but become insoluble even in the presence of non-ionic detergents. The heat inactivation is more dramatic in vivo within the living cell than in vitro, in a detergent-free crude cell lysate. The extent of enzyme inactivation at a given temperature depends on the cell type in which the enzyme is expressed. Luciferase is inactivated at lower temperatures within Drosophila cells than within mouse cells, whereas beta-galactosidase is inactivated at higher temperatures in E. coli than in mouse cells. A heat shock confers a transient increased resistance (thermotolerance) of cells against a second challenging heat shock. Enzyme inactivation during heat shock or exposure of the cells to ethanol is attenuated in heat shock-primed cells. A comparable thermoprotection is raised by a priming heat shock for both luciferase activity and protein synthesis. Thus, the study of reporter enzyme inactivation is a promising tool for understanding the molecular basis of the toxicity of heat shock and related stress as well as the mechanisms leading to thermotolerance."
https://openalex.org/W1988697568,"A simple and reproducible assay for DNA-mediated transfection in the trypanosomatid protozoan Leptomonas seymouri has been developed. The assay is based on expression of the Escherichia coli chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) gene flanked by Leptomonas DNA fragments that are likely to contain necessary elements for gene expression in trypanosomes. After electroporation of cells in the presence of plasmid DNA, CAT activity was detected in crude cell lysates. No activity was detected when the orientation of the L. seymouri mini-exon sequence (placed upstream of the CAT gene) was reversed, or in additional control experiments. This system provides a method for defining transcriptional control elements in trypanosomes."
https://openalex.org/W2073828165,"Guanosine 5'-triphosphate (GTP)-binding proteins have been implicated in the transport of newly synthesized proteins along the secretory pathway of yeast and mammalian cells. Early vesicle fusion events that follow receptor-mediated endocytosis as measured by three in vitro assays were blocked by guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) and aluminum fluoride. The effect was specific for guanosine nucleotides and depended on the presence of cytosolic factors. Thus, GTP-binding proteins may also have a role in the transport of molecules along the endocytic pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1585967257,"The glycosylation of human apolipoprotein (apo) E was examined with purified plasma apoE and apoE produced by transfected cell lines. The carbohydrate attachment site of plasma apoE was localized to a single tryptic peptide (residues 192–206). Sequence analysis and amino sugar analysis of this peptide derived from asialo-, monosialo-, or disialo-apoE indicated that the carbohydrate moiety is attached only to Thr194 in monosialo- and disialo-apoE and that asialo-apoE is not glycosylated. Mammalian cells that normally do not express apoE were transfected with human apoE plasmid expression vectors to test the utilization of potential carbohydrate attachment sites and the role of apoE glycosylation in secretion. Site-specific mutants of apoE, designed to eliminate or alter glycosylation sites, were expressed in HeLa cells by acute transfection. Apolipoprotein E(Thr194 → Ala) was secreted exclusively as the asialo isoform, confirming that Thr194 is the site of carbohydrate attachment in these cells and indicating that glycosylation of apoE is not essential for secretion. Apolipoprotein E(Thr194→Asn, Gly196→Ser), which introduces a potential site for N-glycosylation at position 194, was secreted with a higher apparent molecular weight than native, O-glycosylated apoE. Studies with tunicamycin indicated that this apoE was N-glycosylated at Asn194. Stably transfected cell lines expressing human apoE were prepared from wild-type Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and from CHO ldlD cells, which are defective in glycosylation. The transfected wild-type cells secreted multiply sialylated apoE. The transfected ldlD cells also secreted high levels of apoE even in the absence of glycosylation, which confirms that glycosylation is not essential for secretion of apoE."
https://openalex.org/W1988147435,"Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is caused by a specific loss of the insulin-producing beta cells from pancreatic Langerhans islets. It has been proposed that aberrant expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules on these cells could be a triggering factor for their autoimmune destruction. This proposal was tested in transgenic mice that express allogeneic or syngeneic class II molecules on the surface of islet cells at a level comparable with that normally found on resting B lymphocytes. These animals do not develop diabetes, nor is lymphocyte infiltration of the islets observed. This immunological inactivity does not result from tolerance to the ""foreign"" class II molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1484266107,"The phosphorylation of rabbit skeletal muscle glycogen synthase by casein kinase I is markedly enhanced if the enzyme has previously been phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The presence of phosphate in the primary cAMP-dependent protein kinase sites, sites 1a, 1b, and 2 (serine 7), increases the activity of casein kinase I toward residues in the vicinity of these sites. This synergistic phosphorylation correlates with potent inactivation of the glycogen synthase. Analysis of the NH2 terminus of the enzyme subunit indicated that phosphorylation at serine 7 caused serine 10 to become a preferred casein kinase I site and that phosphoserine can be an important recognition determinant for casein kinase I. This finding can also explain how epinephrine stimulation of skeletal muscle provokes significant increases in the phosphorylation state of serine residues, in particular serine 10, not recognized by cAMP-dependent protein kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1521152447,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa exoenzyme S has appeared to be relatively indiscriminate in its choice of substrates, but in fact it ADP-ribosylates only a small subset of cellular proteins and exhibits a marked preference for several different membrane-associated proteins of apparent Mr = 23,000-25,000, at least some of which appear to bind GTP. One of these is the p21 product of the proto-oncogene c-H-ras, which can be labeled to completion. ADP-ribosylation does not alter the interaction of p21c-H-ras with guanyl nucleotides, but does cause a shift in electrophoretic mobility that implies a large conformational change. Exoenzyme S modifies all of its substrates at arginine residues."
https://openalex.org/W1552850613,"Anthrax lethal toxin consists of two separate proteins, protective antigen and lethal factor (LF). Certain macrophages and a mouse macrophage-like cell line, J774A.1, are lysed by low concentrations of lethal toxin. In contrast, another macrophage cell line, IC-21, and all other cell types tested were resistant to this toxin. To discover the basis for this difference, each step in the intoxication process was examined. No differences between sensitive and resistant cells were found in receptor binding or proteolytic activation of protective antigen, steps that are required prior to LF binding. To determine whether resistance results from a defect in translocation to the cytosol, we introduced LF into J774A.1 and IC-21 cells and a nonmacrophage cell line (L6 myoblast) by osmotic lysis of pinocytic vesicles. Only J774A.1 cells were lysed; no effect was observed in IC-21 and L6 cells. These results suggest that resistant cells either lack the intracellular target of LF or fail to process LF to an active form. The relatively low potency of LF introduced into J774A.1 cells by osmotic lysis suggests that protective antigen may also be required at a stage subsequent to endocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W1557233561,"Abstract Long-chain (sphingoid) bases may serve as another category of lipid second messenger because they inhibit protein kinase C and affect multiple cellular functions. Free sphingosine has been found in rat liver (Merrill, A. H., Jr., Wang, E., Mullins, R. E., Jamison, W. C. L., Nimkar, S., and Liotta, D. C. (1988) Anal. Biochem. 171, 373-381); hence, this study determined if liver plasma membranes contain free long-chain bases and have the ability to form them from endogenous enzymes and substrates. Isolated plasma membranes contained 0.45 nmol of sphingosine/mg of protein which, based on the recovery of the membranes, was equivalent to 3.5 +/- 1.2 nmol/g of liver and at least half of the total free sphingosine in liver. When the membranes were incubated at 37 degrees C, the amount increased at an initial rate of 5-25 pmol/min/mg, resulting in a 2-3-fold increase over an hour. Sphingosine formation required divalent cations, was optimal at neutral to alkaline pH, and was temperature-dependent. Activities with these characteristics were not identified in microsomes or lysosomes (lysosomal activities with acidic pH optima were detected, however); hence, they appear to reflect a separate plasma membrane system. Sphingosine formation was stimulated by ceramides either added exogenously or formed endogenously by treating the membranes with sphingomyelinase (but not endoglycoceramidase). Sphingomyelin hydrolysis to ceramide was also observed during incubation of the plasma membranes alone. Some of the properties of this system resembled the neutral sphingomyelinase and ceramidase activities of liver. While the physiological significance of this endogenous sphingosine is not known, this system has the appropriate subcellular location to provide sphingosine as a participant in signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W1603733096,"Abstract Uptake of mineral ions by isolated matrix vesicles (MV) incubated in synthetic cartilage lymph follows a consistent pattern. After an initial lag period, MV rapidly accumulate large amounts of Ca2+ and Pi before the appearance of crystalline mineral. The ability of MV to accumulate Ca2+ is readily destroyed by proteases, indicating that proteins are important in Ca2+ accumulation. Since MV contain significant amounts of phosphatidylserine (PS), an acidic phospholipid with affinity for Ca2+, it seemed probable that this lipid might also contribute to Ca2+ binding. The development of methods for reproducible isolation of pure active MV enabled us to search for factors responsible for the rapid accumulation of Ca2+. Reported here are studies which reveal that a set of intensely staining MV proteins, extractable with EGTA, selectively bind to Ca2+, but only in the presence of acidic phospholipids. These 30-36-kDa proteins form readily sedimentable insoluble ternary complexes of protein, Ca2+, and lipid in the presence of low levels of Ca2+. With liposomes composed of PS, alone or in combination with phosphatidylethanolamine, submicromolar levels of Ca2+ or certain other divalent cations, but not Mg2+, are sufficient to form the complexes. The physical and chemical properties of these MV proteins appear to be like those of the calpactin family of membrane-associated proteins. In fact, these MV proteins were found to cross-react with antibodies to calpactin II. Thus, calpactins appear to be important protein constituents of avian growth plate MV. This finding helps explain the enrichment in PS previously noted in MV and may also point to the mechanism by which MV rapidly accumulate Ca2+."
https://openalex.org/W1555302032,"A negative element has previously been localized to a 57-base pair segment approximately 300 base pairs upstream of the human c-myc promoter P1. Within this element, a 26-base pair region was protected in vitro from DNase I digestion with a HeLa cell nuclear factor(s). Two specific DNA-protein complexes were identified in gel retardation assays using HeLa cell nuclear extracts and an oligonucleotide probe spanning the footprinted region. Exonuclease and chemical footprint analyses suggested that the binding sites for both complexes are almost entirely overlapping. One of the complexes was eliminated by oligonucleotide competitors possessing known AP-1 binding sites. This same complex reacted strongly with anti-fos immunoglobulin suggesting a role for c-fos in governing c-myc expression. Precipitation of fos protein bound to c-myc DNA that was immobilized on beads confirmed the involvement of c-fos in a specific complex with the c-myc upstream sequence. In contrast, the other complex seen by the c-myc probe could not be competitively inhibited by AP-1 binding sites and was not affected by anti-fos antibody. Instead, this complex was efficiently eliminated by unlabeled oligonucleotides containing the octamer DNA motif found in immunoglobulin gene promoters. Purified octamer-binding proteins formed stable complexes with the 26-base pair c-myc sequences. These results demonstrate that degeneracy in the consensus recognition sequences of these distinct factors allows each of them to bind the c-myc negative element. The interaction of known transcriptional activators with a negative element suggests that the same factors can mediate both transcriptional activation and repression."
https://openalex.org/W1584297698,"A codon frameshift mutation caused by a single base (U) insertion after base pair 4088 of prepro alpha 1(I) mRNA of type I procollagen was identified in a baby with lethal perinatal osteogenesis imperfecta. The mutation was identified in fibroblast RNA by a new method that allows the direct detection of mismatched bases by chemical modification and cleavage in heteroduplexes formed between mRNA and control cDNA probes. The region of mismatches was specifically amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and sequenced. The heterozygous mutation in the amplified cDNA most likely resulted from a T insertion in exon 49 of COL1A1. The frameshift resulted in a truncated pro alpha 1(I) carboxyl-terminal propeptide in which the amino acid sequence was abnormal from Val1146 to the carboxyl terminus. The propeptide lacked Asn1187, which normally carries an N-linked oligosaccharide unit, and was more basic than the normal propeptide. The distribution of cysteines was altered and the mutant propeptide was unable to form normal interchain disulfide bonds. Some of the mutant pro alpha 1(I)' chains were incorporated into type I procollagen molecules but resulted in abnormal helix formation with over-hydroxylation of lysine residues, increased degradation, and poor secretion. Only normal type I collagen was incorporated into the extracellular matrix in vivo resulting in a tissue type I collagen content approximately 20% of that of control (Bateman, J. F., Chan, D., Mascara, T., Rogers, J. G., and Cole, W. G. (1986) Biochem. J. 240, 699-708)."
https://openalex.org/W1500181540,"Substitution of a lysyl residue for Arg-386 of Escherichia coli aspartate aminotransferase resulted in an extensive decrease in Vmax values (0.8% with the aspartate-2-oxoglutarate pair and 0.2% with the glutamate-oxalacetate pair, compared with the corresponding values for the wild-type enzyme). Kinetic analysis of the four sets of half-reactions, the pyridoxal form of the enzyme with aspartate or glutamate and the pyridoxamine form with 2-oxoglutarate or oxalacetate, allowed us to define the independent effect of the mutation on the reactivity of each substrate. Decrease in the first order rate constant (kmax) was more pronounced in the reactions with five-carbon substrates (glutamate and 2-oxoglutarate) than in those with four-carbon substrates (aspartate and oxalacetate), while the increase in the apparent dissociation constant (Kd) was greater for four-carbon substrates than for five-carbon substrates. The decrease of overall catalytic efficiency as judged by the values, kmax/Kd, was more pronounced in the reactions with five-carbon substrates than in those with four-carbon substrates. Affinities for substrate analogs such as succinate, glutarate, 2-methylaspartate, and erythro-3-hydroxyaspartate, were also considerably decreased by the mutation of the enzyme. These findings indicate that the side chain of the lysyl residue, although it bears a positive charge similar to that of the arginyl residue, is not structurally adequate for the productive binding of a substrate during catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W1520062822,"The effect of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation on native and H1-depleted chromatin was analyzed by gel electrophoresis, electron microscopy, and velocity sedimentation. In parallel, the interaction of automodified poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase with native and H1-depleted chromatin was analyzed. In H1-depleted chromatin histone H2B becomes the major poly(ADP-ribose) histone acceptor protein, whereas in native chromatin histone H1 was the major histone acceptor. Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of H1-depleted chromatin prevented the recondensation of polynucleosomes reconstituted with exogenous histone H1. This is probably due to the presence of modified poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and hyper(ADP-ribosyl)ated histone H2B. Indeed, about 40% of the modified enzyme remained associated with H1-depleted chromatin, while less than 1% of the modified enzyme was bound to native chromatin. The influence of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation on the chromatin conformation was also studied at the level of nucleosome in using monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies specific for individual histones and synthetic peptides of histones. In native chromatin incubated in the presence of Mg2+ there was a drop in the accessibility of histone epitopes to monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies whereas upon poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation their accessibility was found to remain even in the presence of Mg2+. In poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated H1-depleted chromatin an increased accessibility of some histone tails to antibodies was observed."

https://openalex.org/W1495837381,"Abstract The generation of diradylglycerols (sn-1,2 diacylglycerols (DAG) and 1-O-alkyl-2-acylglycerols (AAG] was investigated in human polymorphonuclear leukocytes stimulated with fMet-Leu-Phe, phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), or A23187. With each stimulus, the elevations in the mass of DAG clearly preceded that of AAG. The levels of both lipids increased over time, peaked by 15-20 min (fMet-Leu-Phe) or 45-60 min (PMA or A23187) and returned slowly toward base line thereafter. The base-line levels of DAG were some 4-fold higher than levels of AAG. On stimulation, the relative increases in AAG (approximately 4-fold, fMet-Leu-Phe; approximately 20-fold, PMA and A23187) were much greater than the corresponding relative increases in the levels of DAG (approximately 2-fold fMet-Leu-Phe; approximately 5-fold, PMA and A23187). The diradylglycerol responses were dependent upon agonist concentration. Prior treatment with cytochalasin B augmented the fMet-Leu-Phe diradylglycerol responses but did not alter unstimulated or PMA- or A23187-stimulated diradylglycerol responses. Depletion of extracellular Ca2+ blocked responses to fMet-Leu-Phe, but not to PMA. Treatment with pertussis toxin: (a) completely blocked the responses to fMet-Leu-Phe, (b) slightly suppressed the AAG but not the DAG response to PMA, and (c) did not affect the responses to A23187. Gas chromatographic/mass spectral analyses indicated that the AAG generated during cell activation consists of a mixture of species differentiated by 1-O-alkyl chains of 16:0, 18:0, 18:1 and an additional species that remains uncharacterized. Since DAG and AAG are reportedly activators and inhibitors, respectively, of protein kinase C activities, the sequential generation of these lipid messengers may provide for a system to critically control the activation of protein kinase C."
https://openalex.org/W1566192162,"The porcine pancreatic phospholipase A2-catalyzed hydrolysis of the water-soluble chromogenic substrate 4-nitro-3-octanoyloxybenzoate shows an initial latency phase similar to the one observed in the hydrolysis of aggregated phospholipids by the same enzyme. We report here that during the latency phase the enzyme undergoes a slow, autocatalytic, substrate-level acylation whereby in a few of the catalytic events the scissile octanoyl group of the substrate, normally transferred to water, is transferred to the epsilon-amino group of lysine 56. The N epsilon 56-octanoylphospholipase shows a strong tendency to dimerize in solution and thus may be separated from the monomeric native enzyme by gel filtration. Octanoylation of Lys-56 activates the enzyme some 180-fold toward 4-nitro-3-octanoyloxybenzoate and more than 100-fold toward monolayers of 1,2-didecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine. Acylation also attends the enzymatic hydrolysis of 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine with the incorporation of 1 eq of palmitate. Kinetic analysis of the early phase of reaction with 4-nitro-3-octanoyloxybenzoate shows that in this initial step the rate of activation is first order with respect to enzyme and substrate. A much more rapid, autocatalytic activation occurs in the later phases of the reaction where the activation of the enzyme is catalyzed by the activated enzyme itself. These findings with porcine pancreatic phospholipase A2, together with those relative to a snake venom enzyme monomer (Cho, W., Tomasselli, A. G., Heinrikson, R. L., and Kezdy, F. J. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 11237-11241), strongly support the proposal that interfacial activation of monomeric phospholipases is due to substrate-level autoacylation resulting in fully potentiated dimeric enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W299116511,"Fluorescence resonance energy transfer between epidermal growth factor (EGF) molecules, labeled with fluorescent reporter groups, was used as a monitor for EGF receptor-receptor interactions in plasma membranes isolated from human epidermoid A431 cells. Epidermal growth factor molecules labeled at the amino terminus with fluorescein isothiocyanate served as donor molecules in these energy transfer measurements, while EGF molecules labeled with eosin isothiocyanate at the amino terminus served as the energy acceptors. Both of these derivatives were shown to be active in binding to membrane receptors and in the activation of the endogenous receptor/tyrosine kinase activity. We found that membranes in the absence of added metal ion activators showed relatively little energy transfer (approximately 10% donor quenching) between the labeled growth factors. However, divalent metal ion activators of the EGF receptor/tyrosine kinase caused a significant increase in the extent of energy transfer between the labeled EGF molecules. Specifically, in the presence of 20 mM MgCl2, the extent of quenching of the donor fluorescence increased to 25% (from 10% in the absence of metal), while in the presence of 4 mM MnCl2, the extent of energy transfer was increased still further to 40-50%. The addition of an excess of EDTA resulted in the reversal of the observed energy transfer to basal levels. The increased energy transfer in the presence of these divalent cations correlated well with the ability of these metals to stimulate the EGF receptor/tyrosine kinase activity. However, the extent of receptor-receptor interactions measured by energy transfer was independent of receptor autophosphorylation. Overall, these results suggest that conditions under which the EGF receptor is primed to be active as a tyrosine kinase, within a lipid milieu, result in an increased aggregation of the receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1605270926,"The effects of O-glycosylation on the synthesis and secretion of apolipoprotein E (apoE, a glycoprotein with O- but not N-linked sugars) were studied with a UDP-galactose/UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine 4-epimerase-deficient cell mutant (ldlD cells) which expresses a reversible defect in protein O-glycosylation. Under normal culture conditions the mutant ldlD cells cannot add N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) to proteins. GalNAc is the first sugar of mucin-type O-linked oligosaccharides attached to the protein. This O-glycosylation defect is rapidly corrected when GalNAc is added to the culture medium. These cells also require external sources of galactose for the addition of this sugar to O-linked and other oligosaccharides. A bovine papilloma virus-based expression vector for human apoE and the human metallothionein 1A gene were transfected into ldlD cells, and apoE-expressing cell clones resistant to CdCl2 were selected and used in the present studies. The structure and secretion of apoE in these cells were examined by immunoprecipitation and one- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. The synthesis, rate, and extent of secretion of apoE were unaffected by O-glycosylation (GalNAc-independent). In the presence of both galactose and GalNAc, multiple apoE isoforms were synthesized in ldlD cells as a result of variation in the extent of sialylation. ApoE sialylation was dependent on the addition of galactose as well as GalNAc to the extracellular medium, suggesting that addition of galactose to the nascent oligosaccharide chains was required for the addition of sialic acid."

https://openalex.org/W2147820546,"The kinetic mechanism and specificity of the arginine-ornithine antiporter was investigated in membrane vesicles derived from Lactococcus lactis. Membrane vesicles loaded with ornithine, and diluted into an arginine-free medium, rapidly released a limited amount of ornithine during the first seconds of incubation. The amount of ornithine released was independent of the amount initially present on the inside and roughly matched the number of ornithine-binding sites in the membrane. Net flow of ornithine was only observed in membrane vesicles derived from induced cells and blocked by p-chloromercuribenzene sulfonic acid. These results suggest that net flow of ornithine is caused by a single turnover of the antiporter. With saturating concentrations of arginine in the external medium, efflux of ornithine was stoichiometrically coupled to uptake of arginine. Arginine-ornithine exchange and net flow of ornithine are electrically silent and not regulated by the electrical potential. The kinetics of the homologous exchange reactions indicate that the Vmax values for arginine and ornithine uptake are comparable, whereas the apparent Kt values differ. No major sidedness of the apparent Kt values are observed for both surfaces of the cytoplasmic membrane. Various basic amino acid analogues, including optical isomers, are transported as well, albeit with different efficiencies (Vmax/Kt). Evidence for a competitive character of arginine and ornithine interactions for binding sites on the antiporter are provided by transport and binding measurements. The Vmax and apparent Kt for arginine uptake increases with increasing internal ornithine, with little effect on the ratio of Vmax to apparent Kt. These results are discussed in terms of a simple carrier model in which the substrate-binding site is presented alternately to the two surfaces of the membrane as in a Ping Pong mechanism for enzyme kinetics."
https://openalex.org/W1521837750,"Abstract We have isolated for the first time two kinds of endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidases (E-beta-GNases) simultaneously from human kidney. E-beta-GNase 1 was purified by water extraction, ammonium sulfate fractionation, and chromatography on Sephadex-G-200, DEAE-Sephadex, concanavalin A-Sepharose and Hypatite C columns. After the DEAE-Sephadex step, 107 units of E-beta-GNase 1 with a specific activity of 0.53 units/mg was obtained and after hydroxyapatite column, the enzyme recovery was 26 units with a specific activity of 10.4 units/mg. This enzyme hydrolyzed the high mannose-type asparaginylglycopeptide efficiently and had little activity toward the complex-type glycopeptide. This enzyme had an pH optimum at about 4.5 and was not inhibited by acetate ion. The Asn residue in a glycopeptide appeared not to be an important recognition site for E-beta-GNase 1 to express its activity because the acetylation or the dansylation of Asn residues as well as the elimination of Asn residue from the glycopeptide did not change the susceptibility of the oligosaccharide to E-beta-GNase 1. E-beta-GNase 2 was purified by water extraction, ammonium sulfate fractionation, and chromatography on Sephadex G-200, DEAE-Sephadex, concanavalin A-Sepharose, and Mono S columns. This enzyme was purified about 110-fold with 6.6% recovery. E-beta-GNase 2 was found to be a novel type of E-beta-GNase that hydrolyzed both the high mannose-type and the complex-type oligosaccharide with chitobiosyl group at the reducing end and without the Asn. E-beta-GNase 2 activity was found to be dependent on a L-aspartamido-beta-D-N-acetylglucosamine amidohydrolase (Asn-GNase) for the hydrolysis of asparaginylglycopeptide. Asn-GNase cleaved off the Asn residue from the glycopeptide, and the resulting oligosaccharide was hydrolyzed by E-beta-GNase 2. Because the acetylation or the dansylation of Asn residue in a glycopeptide rendered the glycopeptide resistant to Asn-GNase, the use of the modified asparaginylglycopeptide could not reveal the existence of E-beta-GNase 2 activity. The pH optimum of E-beta-GNase was found to be about 3.5. Like beta-hexosaminidases, this enzyme was inhibited by acetate ion, suggesting the recognition of GlcNAc moiety by this enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W95389199,"Abstract N5-(L-1-Carboxyethyl)-L-ornithine:NADP+ oxidoreductase (EC 1.5.1.-) from Streptococcus lactis K1 has been purified 8,000-fold to homogeneity. The NADPH-dependent enzyme mediates the reductive condensation between pyruvic acid and the delta- or epsilon-amino groups of L-ornithine and L-lysine to form N5-(L-1-carboxyethyl)-L-ornithine and N6-(L-1-carboxyethyl)-L-lysine, respectively. The five-step purification procedure involves ion-exchange (DE52 and phosphocellulose P-11), gel filtration (Ultrogel AcA 44), and affinity chromatography (2',5'-ADP-Sepharose 4B). Approximately 100-200 micrograms of purified enzyme of specific activity 40 units/mg were obtained from 60 g of cells, wet weight. Anionic polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed a single enzymatically active protein band, whereas three species (pI 4.8-5.1) were detected by analytical electrofocusing. The purified enzyme is active over a broad pH range of 6.5-9.0 and is stable to heating at 50 degrees C for 10 min. Substrate Km values were determined to be: NADPH, 6.6 microM; pyruvate, 150 microM; ornithine, 3.3 mM; and lysine, 18.2 mM. The oxidoreductase has a relative molecular mass (Mr = 150,000) as estimated by high pressure liquid chromatography exclusion chromatography and by polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis. Conventional gel filtration indicated an Mr = 78,000, and a single protein band of Mr = 38,000 was revealed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The enzyme is composed of identical subunits of Mr = 38,000, which may associate to yield both dimeric and tetrameric forms. Polyclonal antibody to the purified protein inhibited enzyme activity. The amino acid composition of the enzyme is reported, and the sequence of the first 37 amino acids from the NH2 terminus has been determined by stepwise Edman degradation."
https://openalex.org/W1552328395,"The thermodynamics of the hydrolysis of lactose to glucose and galactose have been investigated using both high pressure liquid chromatography and heat-conduction microcalorimetry.

For the process lactose(aq) + H2O(liq) = glucose(aq) + galactose(aq), delta G0 = -8.72 +/- 0.20 kJ.mol-1, K0 = 34 +/- 3, delta H0 = 0.44 +/- 0.11 kJ.mol-1, delta S0 = 30.7 +/- 0.8 J.mol-1.K-1, and delta Cop = 9 +/- 20 J.mol-1.K-1 at 298.15 K. The standard state is the hypothetical ideal solution of unit molality. Thermochemical cycle calculations using enthalpies of combustion and solution, entropies, solubilities, activity coefficients, and apparent molar heat capacities have also been performed. These calculations indicate large discrepancies which are attributable primarily to errors in literature data on the enthalpies of combustion and/or third law entropies of the crystalline forms of the substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1602837522,"Abstract In a previous publication (Wen, L.-P., and Fulco, A. J. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 6676-6682), we described the cloning of the gene encoding cytochrome P-450BM-3, a catalytically self-sufficient fatty acid monooxygenase induced by barbiturates in Bacillus megaterium. We have now subcloned a 1.6-kilobase segment of DNA from this cloned gene that includes the barbiturate-responsive regulatory region as well as 88 bases encoding the NH2-terminal portion of cytochrome P-450BM-3. From this, we generated two series of 5' and 3' deletion derivatives and examined their effects on gene expression. When the 1.6-kilobase fragment or the 1.3-kilobase 5'----3' deletion derivative is inserted into Escherichia coli on a vector containing a promoterless chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene with the sequence encoding the NH2-terminal portion of P-450BM-3 placed immediately in front of the CAT gene, CAT activity is constitutive and unaffected by pentobarbital. On the other hand, the basal level of CAT is low in B. megaterium transformed by the same construct but is strongly inducible by pentobarbital. Furthermore, the multicopy plasmid containing this regulatory region causes a dramatic decrease in both the basal and pentobarbital-induced expression of chromosomally encoded P-450BM-3 in B. megaterium. This competition effect, unlike CAT expression, is independent of the orientation of the regulatory DNA segment in the plasmid. Removal of 0.3 kilobase or more from the 3' end of the 1.6-kilobase segment of DNA or 0.6 kilobase from the 5' end abolishes the competition effect and also eliminates basal and inducible CAT expression in B. megaterium. In transformed E. coli, constitutive CAT expression is maintained when as little as 0.3 kilobase of DNA from the 3' end of the 1.6-kilobase segment is inserted in the correct orientation in front of the CAT gene. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that the synthesis of cytochrome P-450BM-3 in B. megaterium is under positive control and requires gene interaction with at least one trans-acting factor, presumably a protein, to activate transcription from the P-450BM-3 promoter. The binding of this putative protein is mediated by at least two regulatory regions (R1 and R2) that span about 1 kilobase of the 5'-flanking region of the gene."

https://openalex.org/W1481404114,"There are four possible orientations of the substrate ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate in the active site of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase. Distinction between these four possible orientations has been made on the basis of 31P NMR and borohydride-trapping experiments. The orientation of the reaction-intermediate analog, 2'-carboxy-D-arabinitol 1,5-bisphosphate with respect to the divalent metal ion was determined by 31P NMR studies of the quaternary complex, enzyme.CO2.Ni2+.2'-carboxyarabinitol 1,5-bisphosphate. Assignment of the phosphorus resonances of this complex was made by labeling the phosphoryl group at either C-1 or C-5 with 17O. The phosphorus atom closer to the paramagnetic metal ion, Ni2+, to which the broader of the phosphorus resonances is attributed, has been identified as that attached to C-1. When bound to the active site of carbaminated enzyme, D-ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate was reduced by sodium borohydride with absolute stereospecificity to D-arabinitol 1,5-bisphosphate. The reduction of the enzyme-bound substrate thus occurred on the Si face of the C-2 carbonyl group. These two results together establish that ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate is oriented within the active site so that 1) the phosphoryl group at C-1 is closer to the divalent metal ion than that at C-5 and 2) the Si face of the carbonyl group points to the outside world."
https://openalex.org/W1573011375,"Abstract The mRNA transcripts of Rhodospirillum rubrum gene puh, coding for the H subunit of the photoreaction center, and of genes flanking puh were analyzed by blot hybridization. Open reading frame G115, upstream of structural gene puh, is transcribed as a 2.25-kilobase mRNA. Gene puh itself is transcribed as two mRNAs of 1118 and 1032 nucleotides. Mung bean nuclease protection analysis shows that the puh transcripts have different 5' termini within open reading frame G115 and a unique rho-independent termination signal within open reading frame I2372. The lifetimes of the puh messages, as determined by an oxygen blockade of transcription, were 10 and 12 min for the large and small puh mRNAs, respectively. An expression vector carrying a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene was used to select promoters in DNA stretches upstream of the startpoints of each of these transcripts. Chloramphenicol resistance was expressed in Escherichia coli, using as a promoter a 179-nucleotide stretch upstream of the small mRNA startpoint but not from a 124-nucleotide stretch upstream of the large mRNA startpoint. The promoter for the small mRNA, designated Ppuh2, is thought to encompass in its -10 and -35 regions a sigma 70-like RNA polymerase recognition sequence. The region upstream of the large message startpoint contains a sequence similar in its -12 and -24 regions to promoter sequences recognized by the sigma 60 RNA polymerase holoenzyme. This is designated as promoter Ppuh1.Ppuh1 is proposed to be strictly regulated by light intensity and by oxygen tension while Ppuh2 would be less sensitive to these parameters."
https://openalex.org/W1552444309,"To define determinants of interactions of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) with plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1), we utilized site-directed mutagenesis to substitute either threonine or glycine for the active-site serine of tissue-type plasminogen activator. Assays of conditioned media of transfected cells demonstrated that the threonine substitution markedly decreased but did not entirely abolish plasminogen activating activity. In contrast, the glycine substitution yielded a mutant with absolutely no detectable plasminogen activating activity. Wild-type t-PA formed stable complexes with PAI-1. However, even when exogenous inhibitor was present in the medium or purified mutant was added to plasma that had been rendered PAI-1-rich in vivo, the mutants were present in the free form exclusively judging from results of fibrin autography and Western blot analysis. Thus, despite maintenance of some residual plasminogen-activating activity associated with preservation of the hydroxyl group at the active site, the threonine mutant did not form stable complexes with inhibitor. The glycine mutant, developed so that steric hindrance or other unfavorable interactions at the modified active site would be minimal, was similarly incapable of forming complexes with PAI-1. These results show that the presence of an active site serine residue is necessary for formation of stable complexes between t-PA and PAI-1."
https://openalex.org/W1506169215,"EDTA not only blocks the horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-catalyzed iodide oxidation to I3- but also causes an enzymatic conversion of oxidized iodine species to iodide (Banerjee, R. K., De, S. K., Bose, A. K., and Datta, A. G. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 10592–10597). The EDTA effect on both of these reactions can be withdrawn with a higher concentration of iodide and not with H2O2. Spectral studies indicate a possible interaction of EDTA with HRP as evidenced by the formation of modified compound 1 with H2O2 at 416 nm instead of 412 nm in the absence of EDTA. EDTA causes a hypochromic effect on HRP at 402 nm which undergoes the bathochromic red shift to 416 nm by H2O2. The addition of iodide to the 416 nm complex causes the reappearance of the Soret band of HRP at 402 nm. Among various EDTA analogues tested, N-N-N′-N′-tetramethylethylenediamine (TEMED) is 80% as effective as EDTA in the conversion of I-3 to iodide and produces a spectral shift of HRP similar to EDTA. Interaction of EDTA with HRP is further indicated by the hyperchromic effect of HRP and H2O2 on the absorption of EDTA at 212 nm. The addition of oxidized iodine species produces a new peak at 230 nm due to formation of iodide. EDTA at a higher concentration can effectively displace radioiodide specifically bound to HRP indicating its interaction at the iodide-binding site. The enzyme, after radioiodide displacement with EDTA, shows a characteristic absorption maximum at 416 nm on the addition of H2O2, indicating that EDTA is bound with the enzyme. Both positive and negative circular dichroism spectra of HRP and the HRP.H2O2 complex, characteristic of heme absorption, are altered by EDTA, suggesting an EDTA-induced conformational change at or near the heme region. This is associated with a change of affinity of heme toward H2O2 and azide. It is postulated that EDTA interacts at the iodide-binding site of the HRP inducing a new conformation that blocks iodide oxidation but is suitable to convert iodine to iodide by a redox reaction with H2O2."
https://openalex.org/W1538474598,"The ability of metmyoglobin and other heme proteins to promote peroxidation of arachidonic acid under acidic conditions was investigated. Incubation of metmyoglobin with arachidonic acid resulted in a pH-dependent increase in lipid peroxidation as measured by the formation of thiobarbituric acid reactive products and oxygen consumption. Increased peroxidation was observed at pH levels below 6.0, reaching a plateau between pH 5.5 and 5.0. At comparable heme concentrations, metmyoglobin was more efficient than oxymyoglobin, methemoglobin, or ferricytochrome c in promoting arachidonic acid peroxidation. Metmyoglobin also promoted peroxidation of 1-palmityl-2-arachidonyl phosphatidylcholine and methylarachidonate but at significantly lower rates than arachidonic acid. Addition of fatty acid-free albumin inhibited arachidonic acid peroxidation in a molar ratio of 6 to 1 (arachidonic acid:albumin). Both ionic and non-ionic detergents inhibited metmyoglobin-dependent arachidonic acid peroxidation under acidic conditions. The anti-oxidants butylated hydroxytoluene and nordihydroguaiaretic acid and low molecular weight compounds with reduced sulfhydryl groups inhibited the reaction. However, mannitol, benzoic acid, and deferoxamine were without significant effect. Visible absorption spectra of metmyoglobin following reaction with arachidonic acid showed minimal changes consistent with a low level of degradation of the heme protein during the reaction. These observations support the hypothesis that metmyoglobin and other heme proteins can promote significant peroxidation of unsaturated fatty acids under conditions of mildly acidic pH such as may occur at sites of inflammation and during myocardial ischemia and reperfusion. This may be the result of enhanced aggregation of the fatty acid and/or interaction of the fatty acid with heme under acidic conditions."

Despite such a potentially important role for TLX antigens, isolation of human TLX proteins has not yet been reported. As an initial step toward elucidation of the structure and function of TLX antigens, we have isolated TLX proteins from Lubrol-solubilized lymphocytes (termed wTLX) by anti-trophoblast membrane-Sepharose immunoaffinity chromatography. Using Ouchterlony immunodiffusion and immunoelectrophoresis, we have identified an immunoreactive wTLX antigen which forms a single immunoprecipitation line against absorbed anti-trophoblast membrane. From 17.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblot analyses, a 35-kDa band was determined to be a major protein band in the immunoaffinity-isolated wTLX fraction, along with multiple minor wTLX bands. These results suggest the possible existence of antigenic polymorphism of TLX, with predominant expression of the 35-kDa wTLX antigen in lymphocytes. The strong staining of the TLX antigens with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and Amido Black indicates they are largely proteins. Co-isolation of beta 2-microglobulin in the immunoaffinity-isolated wTLX pool could imply that the wTLX antigens may be unique class I HLA-like antigens. This possibility has yet to be resolved."
