https://openalex.org/W3123021790,"Vaccine prioritization There is likely to be high demand for the limited supplies of vaccine against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), so how should vaccine distribution be prioritized? Bubar et al. modeled across countries how uncertainty about a vaccine's characteristics affects prioritization strategies for reducing deaths and transmission (see the Perspective by Fitzpatrick and Galvani). In the model, vaccine efficacy and its ability to reduce disease and/or block transmission was accounted for in relation to age-related variations in susceptibility, fatality rates, and immune decline. In almost all circumstances, reducing fatalities required distributing the vaccine to those who are most at risk of death, usually persons over 60 years of age and those with comorbidities. If a vaccine is leaky or poorly efficacious in older adults, then priority could be given to younger age groups. To increase the available doses, further priority should be given to seronegative individuals. Science , this issue p. 916 ; see also p. 890"
https://openalex.org/W3121790907,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of COVID-19, so understanding its biology and infection mechanisms is critical to facing this major medical challenge. SARS-CoV-2 is known to use its spike glycoprotein to interact with the cell surface as a first step in the infection process. As for other coronaviruses, it is likely that SARS-CoV-2 next undergoes endocytosis, but whether or not this is required for infectivity and the precise endocytic mechanism used are unknown. Using purified spike glycoprotein and lentivirus pseudotyped with spike glycoprotein, a common model of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, we now demonstrate that after engagement with the plasma membrane, SARS-CoV-2 undergoes rapid, clathrin-mediated endocytosis. This suggests that transfer of viral RNA to the cell cytosol occurs from the lumen of the endosomal system. Importantly, we further demonstrate that knockdown of clathrin heavy chain, which blocks clathrin-mediated endocytosis, reduces viral infectivity. These discoveries reveal that SARS-CoV-2 uses clathrin-mediated endocytosis to gain access into cells and suggests that this process is a key aspect of virus infectivity."

Most improvements in power conversion efficiency have come from higher open-circuit voltage, with most fill factor improvements reported for very small-area cells. Peng et al. used a nanostructured titanium oxide electron transport layer to boost the fill factor of larger-area cells (1 square centimeter) to 0.84 by creating local regions with high conductivity.

https://openalex.org/W3122472315,"Personal neoantigen vaccines have been envisioned as an effective approach to induce, amplify and diversify antitumor T cell responses. To define the long-term effects of such a vaccine, we evaluated the clinical outcome and circulating immune responses of eight patients with surgically resected stage IIIB/C or IVM1a/b melanoma, at a median of almost 4 years after treatment with NeoVax, a long-peptide vaccine targeting up to 20 personal neoantigens per patient ( NCT01970358 ). All patients were alive and six were without evidence of active disease. We observed long-term persistence of neoantigen-specific T cell responses following vaccination, with ex vivo detection of neoantigen-specific T cells exhibiting a memory phenotype. We also found diversification of neoantigen-specific T cell clones over time, with emergence of multiple T cell receptor clonotypes exhibiting distinct functional avidities. Furthermore, we detected evidence of tumor infiltration by neoantigen-specific T cell clones after vaccination and epitope spreading, suggesting on-target vaccine-induced tumor cell killing. Personal neoantigen peptide vaccines thus induce T cell responses that persist over years and broaden the spectrum of tumor-specific cytotoxicity in patients with melanoma."

Reynolds et al. used single-cell sequencing to generate an atlas of the human skin from both developing and adult sources, identifying differences and similarities across heterogeneous populations of skin cells. In this atlas, gene expression in the two disease states studied—atopic dermatitis and psoriasis—varied from that in a healthy adult, suggesting that a fetal skin signature is expressed in adult inflamed skin. Furthermore, differences in immune cell composition between healthy fetal and adult skin and that of individuals suffering from disease were observed. Science , this issue p. eaba6500"
https://openalex.org/W3116482072,"SARS-CoV-2 infection causes more severe disease in pregnant women compared to age-matched non-pregnant women. Whether maternal infection causes changes in the transfer of immunity to infants remains unclear. Maternal infections have previously been associated with compromised placental antibody transfer, but the mechanism underlying this compromised transfer is not established. Here, we used systems serology to characterize the Fc profile of influenza-, pertussis-, and SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies transferred across the placenta. Influenza- and pertussis-specific antibodies were actively transferred. However, SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody transfer was significantly reduced compared to influenza- and pertussis-specific antibodies, and cord titers and functional activity were lower than in maternal plasma. This effect was only observed in third-trimester infection. SARS-CoV-2-specific transfer was linked to altered SARS-CoV-2-antibody glycosylation profiles and was partially rescued by infection-induced increases in IgG and increased FCGR3A placental expression. These results point to unexpected compensatory mechanisms to boost immunity in neonates, providing insights for maternal vaccine design."
https://openalex.org/W3123123300,"A metabolic circuit in T cell immunity Naïve T cells are metabolically reprogrammed when they differentiate into T effector (T eff ) cells, transitioning from a reliance on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis. Xu et al. found that lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), a glycolytic enzyme that converts pyruvate to lactate, is a key player in this process. T eff cells that differentiate in mice infected with the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes turned on LDHA through phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling. By promoting adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, LDHA in turn facilitated PI3K-dependent inactivation of the transcription factor Foxo1 needed for effective T eff cell responses. Thus, glycolytic ATP acts like a rheostat that both gauges and regulates PI3K-dependent signaling. This type of positive feedback circuit may also provide a mechanistic explanation for the Warburg effect observed in cancer cells. Science , this issue p. 405"
https://openalex.org/W3126109961,"Understanding how the local environment of a single-atom catalyst affects stability and reactivity remains a significant challenge. We present an in-depth study of Cu1, Ag1, Au1, Ni1, Pd1, Pt1, Rh1, and Ir1 species on Fe3O4(001); a model support where all metals occupy the same 2-fold coordinated adsorption site upon deposition at room temperature. Surface science techniques revealed that CO adsorption strength at single metal sites differs from the respective metal surfaces and supported clusters. Charge transfer into the support modifies the d-states of the metal atom and the strength of the metal-CO bond. These effects could strengthen the bond (as for Ag1-CO) or weaken it (as for Ni1-CO), but CO-induced structural distortions reduce adsorption energies from those expected based on electronic structure alone. The extent of the relaxations depends on the local geometry and could be predicted by analogy to coordination chemistry."
https://openalex.org/W3123518732,"Detailed phylogenies of tumor populations can recount the history and chronology of critical events during cancer progression, such as metastatic dissemination. We applied a Cas9-based, single-cell lineage tracer to study the rates, routes, and drivers of metastasis in a lung cancer xenograft mouse model. We report deeply resolved phylogenies for tens of thousands of cancer cells traced over months of growth and dissemination. This revealed stark heterogeneity in metastatic capacity, arising from preexisting and heritable differences in gene expression. We demonstrate that these identified genes can drive invasiveness and uncovered an unanticipated suppressive role for KRT17 We also show that metastases disseminated via multidirectional tissue routes and complex seeding topologies. Overall, we demonstrate the power of tracing cancer progression at subclonal resolution and vast scale."
https://openalex.org/W3121866151,"The unique electronic structure found at interfaces between materials can allow unconventional quantum states to emerge. Here we observe superconductivity in electron gases formed at interfaces between (111) oriented KTaO$_3$ and insulating overlayers of either EuO or LaAlO$_3$. The superconducting transition temperature, approaching 2.2 K, is about one order of magnitude higher than that of the LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ system. Strikingly, similar electron gases at (001) KTaO$_3$ interfaces remain normal down to 25 mK. The critical field and current-voltage measurements indicate that the superconductivity is two dimensional. Higher mobility EuO/KTaO$_3$ (111) samples show a large in-plane anisotropy in transport properties at low temperatures prior to onset of superconductivity, suggesting the emergence of a stripe like phase where the superconductivity is nearly homogeneous in one direction, but strongly modulated in the other."

https://openalex.org/W3125983721,"Polycomb repressive complexes 1 and 2 (PRC1 and PRC2) cooperate to determine cell identity by epigenetic gene expression regulation. However, the mechanism of PRC2 recruitment by means of recognition of PRC1-mediated H2AK119ub1 remains poorly understood. Our PRC2 cryo-electron microscopy structure with cofactors JARID2 and AEBP2 bound to a H2AK119ub1-containing nucleosome reveals a bridge helix in EZH2 that connects the SET domain, H3 tail, and nucleosomal DNA. JARID2 and AEBP2 each interact with one ubiquitin and the H2A-H2B surface. JARID2 stimulates PRC2 through interactions with both the polycomb protein EED and the H2AK119-ubiquitin, whereas AEBP2 has an additional scaffolding role. The presence of these cofactors partially overcomes the inhibitory effect that H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 exert on core PRC2 (in the absence of cofactors). Our results support a key role for JARID2 and AEBP2 in the cross-talk between histone modifications and PRC2 activity."
https://openalex.org/W3125598108,"Keeping Z -olefins intact with iridium Transition metal catalysis offers a versatile means of modifying carbon centers adjacent to carbon-carbon double bonds. However, in the course of these reactions, the double bond tends to get weakened, allowing its substituents to swivel back and forth. Thus, if two large groups start out on the same side of the bond axis (a geometry known as a Z -olefin), they end up on opposite sides in the product. Jiang et al. report a chiral iridium catalyst that prevents this swiveling just long enough to substitute the adjacent carbon enantioselectively (see the Perspective by Malcolmson).

https://openalex.org/W3124394605,"Abstract Substantial global effort has been devoted to curtailing the tobacco epidemic over the past two decades, especially after the adoption of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control 1 by the World Health Organization in 2003. In 2015, in recognition of the burden resulting from tobacco use, strengthened tobacco control was included as a global development target in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development 2 . Here we show that comprehensive tobacco control policies—including smoking bans, health warnings, advertising bans and tobacco taxes—are effective in reducing smoking prevalence; amplified positive effects are seen when these policies are implemented simultaneously within a given country. We find that if all 155 countries included in our counterfactual analysis had adopted smoking bans, health warnings and advertising bans at the strictest level and raised cigarette prices to at least 7.73 international dollars in 2009, there would have been about 100 million fewer smokers in the world in 2017. These findings highlight the urgent need for countries to move toward an accelerated implementation of a set of strong tobacco control practices, thus curbing the burden of smoking-attributable diseases and deaths."
https://openalex.org/W3125238661,"Convergent evolution provides insights into the selective drivers underlying evolutionary change. Snake venoms, with a direct genetic basis and clearly defined functional phenotype, provide a model system for exploring the repeated evolution of adaptations. While snakes use venom primarily for predation, and venom composition often reflects diet specificity, three lineages of cobras have independently evolved the ability to spit venom at adversaries. Using gene, protein, and functional analyses, we show that the three spitting lineages possess venoms characterized by an up-regulation of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) toxins, which potentiate the action of preexisting venom cytotoxins to activate mammalian sensory neurons and cause enhanced pain. These repeated independent changes provide a fascinating example of convergent evolution across multiple phenotypic levels driven by selection for defense."

https://openalex.org/W3123057917,"Cross-talk between histone modifications Histone modifications play pivotal roles within the intricate protein networks that underlie transcription and gene silencing in eukaryotic genomes. The enzymes that deposit them undergo spatiotemporal fine-tuning of their catalytic activity; one example is trans-histone cross-talk, in which one histone modification activates an enzyme responsible for another histone modification. Valencia-Sánchez et al. show that histone H4 lysine 16 acetylation (H4K16ac), a hallmark of decondensed, transcriptionally permissive chromatin, directly stimulates the Dot1 histone H3 lysine 79 methyltransferase. Structural, biochemical, and cellular data explain Dot1's regulation by H4K16ac and show how it coordinates with a second positive regulator of Dot1, histone H2B ubiquitination.

Whether these changes can be exploited by intracellular pathogens remains an open question. Rosenberg et al. report that infection with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ( S. Tm) induces the accumulation of the metabolite succinate in macrophages (see the Perspective by Lynch and Lesser). This key intermediate in the citric acid cycle activates virulence genes in S. Tm, leading to microbial resistance. Moreover, the active transport of succinate through the C4-dicarboxylate transporter DcuB is required for S. Tm virulence and survival within macrophages. Sensing of citric acid cycle intermediates may more generally serve as a cue to initiate the resistance programs of intracellular pathogens. Science , this issue p. 400 ; see also p. 344"

Smith et al. provide evidence for another mechanism, an approximate combination of the two. They monitored the interaction of vasopressin type 2 receptors (V2Rs) and G α proteins in cultured cells using bioluminescent resonance energy transfer. Even though V2Rs do not signal canonically through G α i proteins, they promoted the formation of complexes containing β-arrestin and G α i , and this led to downstream signaling to extracellular signal-regulated kinase protein kinases.

https://openalex.org/W3124131556,"The circuit mechanisms underlying fear-induced suppression of feeding are poorly understood. To help fill this gap, mice were fear conditioned, and the resulting changes in synaptic connectivity among the locus coeruleus (LC), the parabrachial nucleus (PBN), and the central nucleus of amygdala (CeA)-all of which are implicated in fear and feeding-were studied. LC neurons co-released noradrenaline and glutamate to excite PBN neurons and suppress feeding. LC neurons also suppressed inhibitory input to PBN neurons by inducing heterosynaptic, endocannabinoid-dependent, long-term depression of CeA synapses. Blocking or knocking down endocannabinoid receptors in CeA neurons prevented fear-induced depression of CeA synaptic transmission and fear-induced suppression of feeding. Altogether, these studies demonstrate that LC neurons play a pivotal role in modulating the circuitry that underlies fear-induced suppression of feeding, pointing to new ways of alleviating stress-induced eating disorders."
https://openalex.org/W3124517608,"SIRT5 is a member of the sirtuin family of NAD+-dependent protein lysine deacylases implicated in a variety of physiological processes. SIRT5 removes negatively charged malonyl, succinyl, and glutaryl groups from lysine residues and thereby regulates multiple enzymes involved in cellular metabolism and other biological processes. SIRT5 is overexpressed in human breast cancers and other malignancies, but little is known about the therapeutic potential of SIRT5 inhibition for treating cancer. Here we report that genetic SIRT5 disruption in breast cancer cell lines and mouse models caused increased succinylation of IDH2 and other metabolic enzymes, increased oxidative stress, and impaired transformation and tumorigenesis. We, therefore, developed potent, selective, and cell-permeable small-molecule SIRT5 inhibitors. SIRT5 inhibition suppressed the transformed properties of cultured breast cancer cells and significantly reduced mammary tumor growth in vivo, in both genetically engineered and xenotransplant mouse models. Considering that Sirt5 knockout mice are generally normal, with only mild phenotypes observed, these data establish SIRT5 as a promising target for treating breast cancer. The new SIRT5 inhibitors provide useful probes for future investigations of SIRT5 and an avenue for targeting SIRT5 as a therapeutic strategy."
https://openalex.org/W3121178421,"Cuticular pheromone circadian regulation Several species of anopheline mosquitoes are important malaria vectors in Africa. Male mosquitoes show species-specific swarming behaviors at certain times of the day to attract females for mating. Wang et al. found that transcriptional patterns of metabolic and immune function genes apparently showed a diurnal rhythm that correlated with the physiological demands of mating flight swarming (see the Perspective by Manoukis). By altering temperature and light regimes and by knocking out the master genes period and timeless for circadian clock regulation, the authors disrupted mating flight behavior in a combination of cage experiments and enclosed field conditions. Knocking out the rhythmically expressed desaturase enzyme reduced cuticular hydrocarbon pheromone production and limited mating success. These key interacting components of the diurnal regulation of mosquito mating behavior are potential targets for alternative malaria control strategies. Science , this issue p. 411 ; see also p. 340"
https://openalex.org/W3112421824,"Of the 800 G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) in humans, only three (GPR4, GPR65, and GPR68) regulate signaling in acidified microenvironments by sensing protons (H+). How these receptors have uniquely obtained this ability is unknown. Here, we show these receptors evolved the capability to sense H+ signals by acquiring buried acidic residues. Using our informatics platform pHinder, we identified a triad of buried acidic residues shared by all three receptors, a feature distinct from all other human GPCRs. Phylogenetic analysis shows the triad emerged in GPR65, the immediate ancestor of GPR4 and GPR68. To understand the evolutionary and mechanistic importance of these triad residues, we developed deep variant profiling, a yeast-based technology that utilizes high-throughput CRISPR to build and profile large libraries of GPCR variants. Using deep variant profiling and GPCR assays in HEK293 cells, we assessed the pH-sensing contributions of each triad residue in all three receptors. As predicted by our calculations, most triad mutations had profound effects consistent with direct regulation of receptor pH sensing. In addition, we found that an allosteric modulator of many class A GPCRs, Na+, synergistically regulated pH sensing by maintaining the pKa values of triad residues within the physiologically relevant pH range. As such, we show that all three receptors function as coincidence detectors of H+ and Na+. Taken together, these findings elucidate the molecular evolution and long-sought mechanism of GPR4, GPR65, and GPR68 pH sensing and provide pH-insensitive variants that should be valuable for assessing the therapeutic potential and (patho)physiological importance of GPCR pH sensing.

Pawlyk A. Colvis C. Margolis R. Baker J. Glimmers in illuminating the druggable genome.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2018; 17: 301-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). One approach for illuminating the biological importance of these receptors is to understand how they evolved the ability to sense protons. This insight would provide both a mechanistic explanation for GPCR pH sensing and enable the engineering of functional receptor variants insensitive to physiological pH changes, which has yet to be achieved. Such variants would finally enable a true assessment of the effects and physiological importance of GPCR pH sensing in a variety of in vitro and in vivo model systems. Elucidating the mechanisms of macromolecular pH sensing remains a formidable computational and experimental challenge. As a result, there are relatively few known pH-sensing proteins (pH sensors) and even fewer examples of discrete pH-sensing mechanisms. This lack of insight has prevented us from recognizing the broader implications for pH sensing throughout biology and disease. Like well-known pH sensors, such as hemoglobin (30Perutz M.F. Electrostatic effects in proteins.Science. 1978; 201: 1187-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar), GPCR pH sensors can only detect protons using five amino acids: aspartic acid (Asp, D), glutamic acid (Glu, E), histidine (His, H), arginine (Arg, R), and lysine (Lys, K). Most proteins are insensitive to physiological pH changes because their ionizable residues are constantly charged between pH 5 and 7.4. In contrast, pH sensors contain specialized ionizable residues that (un)charge in response to physiological pH changes to regulate protein structure, function, and biology. In the case of GPCR pH sensors, such residues detect and transduce extracellular proton signals to activate intracellular signaling pathways and elicit appropriate, context-dependent cellular responses. Although pH sensing by His residues is widely recognized (31White K.A. Ruiz D.G. Szpiech Z.A. Strauli N.B. Hernandez R.D. Jacobson M.P. Barber D.L.

Cannon B.R. Castaneda C.A. Robinson A. Garcia-Moreno B. High tolerance for ionizable residues in the hydrophobic interior of proteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

His is conceptually associated with pH sensing because its pKa value of 6.6 ± 1.0 is in the physiological pH range (36Grimsley G.R. Scholtz J.M. Pace C.N. A summary of the measured pK values of the ionizable groups in folded proteins.Protein Sci. 2009; 18: 247-251PubMed Google Scholar). However, the more extreme pKa values of acidic Asp and Glu residues (typically <4.5) (36Grimsley G.R. Scholtz J.M. Pace C.N. A summary of the measured pK values of the ionizable groups in folded proteins.Protein Sci. 2009; 18: 247-251PubMed Google Scholar), and basic Arg and Lys residues (typically >10) (36Grimsley G.R. Scholtz J.M. Pace C.N. A summary of the measured pK values of the ionizable groups in folded proteins.Protein Sci. 2009; 18: 247-251PubMed Google Scholar), can be shifted into the physiological pH range when buried in the protein interior (33Isom D.G. Cannon B.R. Castaneda C.A. Robinson A. Garcia-Moreno B. High tolerance for ionizable residues in the hydrophobic interior of proteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Large shifts in pKa values of lysine residues buried inside a protein.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2011; 108: 5260-5265Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). As such, buried Asp, Glu, Arg, and Lys residues can make important contributions to pH-sensing mechanisms and serve as important predictors in the search for proteins that couple changes in pH to the regulation of biological function. Previously, we have shown that GPCRs often contain buried ionizable residues (37Isom D.G. Dohlman H.G. Buried ionizable networks are an ancient hallmark of G protein-coupled receptor activation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2015; 112: 5702-5707Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar); however, it is unclear whether such residues are important for the physiological control of GPCR signaling by pH signals. In this study, we show that 3 human GPCRs evolved the ability to sense pH by acquiring buried acidic residues that emerged in GPR65 and were later inherited by GPR4 and GPR68. Before this finding, pH sensing by these receptors was thought to originate solely from extracellular His (eHis) residues (1Ludwig M.G. Vanek M. Guerini D. Gasser J.A. Jones C.E. Junker U.

Res. 2010; 61: 499-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, most of these eHis residues appeared in GPR4 and GPR68 after GPR65 evolved the ability to sense protons. This advance in our understanding of GPCR pH sensing was made possible by our informatics platform, known as pHinder (40Isom D.G. Sridharan V. Baker R. Clement S.T. Smalley D.M. Dohlman H.G. Protons as second messenger regulators of G protein signaling.Mol. Cell. 2013; 51: 531-538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), which we created for identifying pH-sensing structural features that are often overlooked. In the case of GPR4, GPR65, and GPR68, our pHinder calculations identified a triad of buried acidic residues that have escaped the attention of the field for almost 2 decades. Here, we used our new yeast-based technology, deep variant profiling (DVP), along with GPCR assays in HEK293 cells and phylogenetic analyses to confirm our computational prediction that these residues are responsible for the molecular evolution and mechanism of GPCR pH sensing. pHinder is an informatics program that uses computational geometry to identify structural features, such as buried ionizable residues, that are predictive of pH sensing (40Isom D.G. Sridharan V. Baker R. Clement S.T. Smalley D.M. Dohlman H.G. Protons as second messenger regulators of G protein signaling.Mol. Cell. 2013; 51: 531-538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In the pHinder algorithm (see Fig. S1A), Asp, Glu, His, Lys, and Arg residues are triangulated to calculate a topological network of ionizable residues in a protein. A molecular surface is then calculated and used to identify buried network nodes that reside below the surface. In this work, we used such calculations to identify a distinctive network of buried acidic residues in homology models of GPR4, GPR65, and GPR68 pH sensors. Drawing from our extensive experience studying such residues in other proteins, we hypothesized that the neutral (protonated) ensemble of these buried acidic residues was directly responsible for acid-activated GPCR signaling, and thus pH sensing. As shown in Figure 1, all 3 GPCR pH sensors share a triad of buried acidic residues not observed in 416 other human GPCR structures (Fig. S1B). As illustrated in Figure 1A, we refer to 2 of the 3 acidic residues as the DyaD site because they comprise a pair of closely spaced Asp residues originating from transmembrane helices 2 and 7. Notably, Na+ ions observed in several GPCR structures map to the vicinity of the DyaD site (Fig. S1C), suggesting that Na+ may have the potential to modulate GPCR pH sensing. The third acidic residue of the triad, which we call the apEx residue, is a Glu that originates from transmembrane helix 4 and is located ∼16 Å from the DyaD site. In all 3 GPCRs (Fig. 1, B–D), the buried acidic triad is positioned approximately horizontal to the plasma membrane near the midpoint of each receptor. In addition to the buried acidic triads, Figure 1, B–D shows the 26 residue positions that have been investigated in prior studies of GPCR pH sensing (1Ludwig M.G. Vanek M. Guerini D. Gasser J.A.

Res. 2010; 61: 499-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We collectively refer to these positions as reported sites (rSites), which correspond to locations in and near the orthosteric ligand-binding sites of other class A receptors. Our hypothesis that these buried acidic triads are responsible for GPCR pH sensing predicts several possible outcomes. Because protonation of the triad ensemble at low pH should activate all 3 receptors, isosteric Asn and Gln mutations that mimic the neutral forms of Asp and Glu side chains should result in receptor variants that retain function yet signal independent of extracellular pH below ∼7.4. This outcome would also confirm that triad residues have dramatically upshifted pKa values. Furthermore, favorable electrostatic interactions between DyaD residues and Na+, a known negative allosteric modulator (NAM) of GPCR signaling (41Zarzycka B. Zaidi S.A. Roth B.L. Katritch V. Harnessing ion-binding sites for GPCR pharmacology.Pharmacol. Rev. 2019; 71: 571-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), should reduce the magnitude of DyaD site pKa shifts to maintain GPCR pH sensing within the physiologically relevant pH range. This outcome would also confirm that the DyaD residues are directly involved in the pH-sensing mechanism. Finally, because buried ionizable residues are usually destabilizing (33Isom D.G. Cannon B.R. Castaneda C.A. Robinson A. Garcia-Moreno B. High tolerance for ionizable residues in the hydrophobic interior of proteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Large shifts in pKa values of lysine residues buried inside a protein.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2011; 108: 5260-5265Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), their removal by Asn and Gln mutations should increase GPCR stability to maintain or enhance signal efficacy. As will follow, we successfully confirmed this set of predicted outcomes using both a new method we developed for high-throughput mutational profiling in yeast and in vitro assays in HEK293 cells. Recently, we developed Dynamic Cyan Induction by Functional Integrated Receptors (DCyFIR), a yeast-based platform for rapidly profiling ligand responses by human GPCRs (42Kapolka N.J. Taghon G.J.

In the DCyFIR platform, a genome-integrated human GPCR couples to a human/yeast C-terminal Gα chimera to drive the expression of a cyan transcriptional reporter (mTurquoise2) (Fig. 2A). DCyFIR compliments more traditional in vitro GPCR assays in several unique ways. Because yeast have only one GPCR pathway, grow rapidly, are pH tolerant, and do not require stringent cell culture techniques, the DCyFIR system is ideal for high-throughput experimental formats. In addition, our ability to install and barcode yeast strains with human GPCRs using high-throughput CRISPR engineering adds to the utility and versatility of DCyFIR profiling (42Kapolka N.J. Taghon G.J. Rowe J.B. Morgan W.M. Enten J.F. Lambert N.A. Isom D.G. DCyFIR: a high-throughput CRISPR platform for multiplexed G protein-coupled receptor profiling and ligand discovery.Proc. Natl.

Chem. 2020; 295: 8262-8271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Finally, the DCyFIR strain collection enables us to independently interrogate individual GPCR–Gα coupling interactions for all 10 possible GPCR–Gα coupling combinations (Fig. 2A). Here, we introduce a new DCyFIR-based method called DVP. Using DVP, we can rapidly build DCyFIR strain libraries that assess the effects of GPCR SNPs, test mutations in the process of developing designer GPCRs and biosensors, and, as in this study, evaluate residues computationally predicted to regulate GPCR structure–function relationships. As such, the insights gained from higher throughput DVP studies can be used to prioritize and inform lower throughput studies in mammalian cell models. Here, we used DVP to characterize each component of the buried acidic triads in GPR4, GPR65, and GPR68 (9 total mutations), along with all 26 rSites (Fig. 2B). Because we test all 10 possible GPCR–Gα coupling interactions in the DCyFIR system (Fig. 2A), our DVP experiments required us to build a library of 420 DCyFIR strains using our high-throughput CRISPR pipeline. DVP at pH 5.0 showed that 36 of 39 mutant receptors (9/11 GPR4, 11/11 GPR65, and 16/17 GPR68) were functional in 195 DCyFIR strains (58/110 GPR4, 77/110 GPR65, and 60/170 GPR68 strains) (Fig. 2B). Consistent with prior work (1Ludwig M.G. Vanek M. Guerini D. Gasser J.A. Jones C.E. Junker U. Hofstetter H. Wolf R.M. Seuwen K.

As predicted, most triad mutants (7 of 9) signaled as well or better than WT in one or more DCyFIR strains (Fig. 2B and Fig. S2). The two exceptions were the DyaD mutant GPR4–D63N and apEx mutant GPR68–E149Q, the latter of which is complicated by weak WT GPR68 signaling, an observation consistent with our prior finding and explanation of weak GPR68 signaling in the yeast system (43Rowe J.B.

Furthermore, we found most triad mutants maintained WT Gα coupling patterns and in two cases gained newly detectable Gα coupling interactions: DyaD mutants GPR4–D282N and GPR68–D67N.

In a patient-derived xenograft model that recapitulates IRF4 pathway activation in human myeloma, we test the effects of IRF4 antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) and identify a lead agent for clinical development (ION251). IRF4 overexpression expands myeloma progenitors, while IRF4 ASOs impair myeloma cell survival and reduce IRF4 and c-MYC expression. IRF4 ASO monotherapy impedes tumor formation and myeloma dissemination in xenograft models, improving animal survival. Moreover, IRF4 ASOs eradicate myeloma progenitors and malignant plasma cells while sparing normal human hematopoietic stem cell development. Mechanistically, IRF4 inhibition disrupts cell cycle progression, downregulates stem cell and cell adhesion transcript expression, and promotes sensitivity to myeloma drugs.

Interestingly, rare genetic variants of human ABCA13 are related to susceptibility for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depression (7Knight H.M. Pickard B.S. Maclean A. Malloy M.P.

For example, one replication study on some of these rare variants failed to find this relation in an independent sample set (20Dwyer S. Williams H. Jones I. Jones L. Walters J. Craddock N. Owen M.J. O'Donovan M.C. Investigation of rare non-synonymous variants at ABCA13 in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.Mol. Psychiatry. 2011; 16: 790-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). A monkey carrying the heterozygous ABCA13 deletion displayed impaired social ability and restricted and repetitive behaviors that are most frequently associated with autism spectrum disorder (21Iritani S. Torii Y. Habuchi C. Sekiguchi H. Fujishiro H. Yoshida M. Go Y. Iriki A. Isoda M. Ozaki N.

However, the same monkey had a nonsense mutation in 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) receptor 2C. 5-Hydroxytryptamine receptor 2C has been associated with neuropsychiatric disorders including autism spectrum disorder, leaving it unclear whether the heterozygous ABCA13 deletion caused the autism spectrum disorder-like phenotypes. Additionally, in a Drosophila model, knockdown of CG1718, which is homologous to human ABCA13, induced increased social space and abnormal circadian rhythm (23Ueoka I. Kawashima H. Konishi A. Aoki M. Tanaka R. Yoshida H. Maeda T. Ozaki M. Yamaguchi M. Novel Drosophila model for psychiatric disorders including autism spectrum disorder by targeting of ATP-binding cassette protein A.Exp. Neurol. 2018; 300: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, in reality, the amino acid sequence and protein size of CG1718 are more similar to that of ABCA3 than ABCA13. In this study, to elucidate the molecular functions of ABCA13, we examined the subcellular localization and function of ABCA13 in HEK293 cells transfected with mouse ABCA13. To study the physiological roles of ABCA13, we generated Abca13 KO mice using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated proteins (CRISPR/Cas) system and investigated the impact of ABCA13 deletion on behavioral phenotypes. In addition, we examined the intracellular cholesterol distribution and synaptic vesicle endocytosis in Abca13 KO cortical neuronal cultures. We performed ABCA13 mutant analysis to determine the effects of mutations associated with psychiatric disorders on ABCA13 function, finding that abnormal psychological behaviors correlated with impairments in the subcellular localization of and cholesterol trafficking by ABCA13. To determine the size of ABCA13 mainly expressed in mice, western blotting was performed using mouse kidney (Fig. 1A), where Abca13 is highly expressed. A major band was mainly detected at >460 kDa, which is consistent with the predicted molecular mass of full-size ABCA13 (570 kDa). This result indicates that ABCA13 is mainly expressed as a protein containing the long N-terminal region in mice. To study the biochemical activity of full-size ABCA13, we examined the protein's subcellular localization. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with a plasmid expressing full-length mouse ABCA13 (5034 amino acids). Western blot analysis (Fig. 1B) showed a band of similar size to ABCA13 expressed in vivo. Immunostaining revealed that ABCA13 was localized in intracellular vesicles in HEK293 cells (Fig. 1C). Many members of the ABCA subfamily play important roles in lipid transport processes (8Albrecht C. Viturro E.

To determine whether ABCA13 is involved in lipid trafficking, we compared the intracellular cholesterol distribution in control and ABCA13-expressing HEK293 cells using the fluorescent cholesterol-binding probe filipin (Fig. 2A). ABCA13-positive vesicles were colocalized with the fluorescent signals in ABCA13-transfected cells. On the other hand, the intense signals of filipin in vesicles were much less observed in control cells. The fluorescent probe EGFP-D4 was reported to target cholesterol-rich membrane domains (24Liu S.L. Sheng R. Jung J.H. Wang L. Stec E. O'Connor M.J. Song S. Bikkavilli R.K. Winn R.A. Lee D. Baek K.

Fluorescence image screening for chemical compounds modifying cholesterol metabolism and distribution.J. Lipid Res. 2011; 52: 2084-2094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Consistently, the vesicles where ABCA13 was detected were also strongly labeled with EGFP-D4 (Fig. 2B), but EGFP-D4 staining was hardly observed in control cells. Additionally, quantitative image analysis showed that EGFP-D4 staining was significantly higher in ABCA13-transfected cells compared with mock cells (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that transiently expressed ABCA13 causes cholesterol accumulation in vesicles. To examine whether human endogenous ABCA13 is localized in intracellular vesicles and affects intracellular cholesterol distribution, we used U2OS cells, a human osteosarcoma cell line that expresses endogenous ABCA13 (Fig. S1). As with our HEK293 experiments, in U2OS cells, intracellular vesicles where ABCA13 was detected were strongly stained with filipin (Fig. 2D). These results indicate that endogenously expressed human ABCA13 causes cholesterol accumulation in intracellular vesicles (ABCA13-vesicles) like mouse ABCA13. Lipids are transferred between the plasma membrane and subcellular organelles (26Ikonen E. Cellular cholesterol trafficking and compartmentalization.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 125-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar, 27Jackson C.L. Walch L. Verbavatz J.M. Lipids and their trafficking: an integral part of cellular organization.Dev. Cell. 2016; 39: 139-153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Since the plasma membrane contains 40–90% of total cellular cholesterol (28Litvinov D.Y. Savushkin E.V. Dergunov A.D. Intracellular and plasma membrane events in cholesterol transport and homeostasis.J. Lipids. 2018; 2018: 3965054Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the cholesterol accumulated in vesicles by ABCA13 was derived from the plasma membrane. To evaluate this possibility, we used EGFP-D4 to track plasma-membrane cholesterol in living cells. Incubation at 37 °C can internalize EGFP-D4, which binds to cholesterol of the exofacial leaflets of the plasma membrane, in living cells (29Maekawa M. Fairn G.D. Complementary probes reveal that phosphatidylserine is required for the proper transbilayer distribution of cholesterol.J. Cell Sci. 2015; 128: 1422-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we found EGFP-D4 was internalized and colocalized in ABCA13-vesicles in HEK293 cells (Fig. 3A), but not in mock transfected cells under the same conditions. Pretreatment with MβCD, which removes cholesterol from the plasma membrane (30Zidovetzki R. Levitan I. Use of cyclodextrins to manipulate plasma membrane cholesterol content: evidence, misconceptions and control strategies.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1768: 1311-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar), resulted in no binding of EGFP-D4 to the cell even though ABCA13-vesicles were detected. These results suggest that ABCA13 accelerates the internalization of cholesterol from the plasma membrane. Because gangliosides are known to form microdomains containing cholesterol at the plasma membrane (31Simons K. Toomre D. Lipid rafts and signal transduction.Nat. Rev. Mol.

Biol. 2016; 12: 402-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), we examined whether gangliosides such as GM1 and GM3 were also incorporated into ABCA13-vesicles. HEK293 cells transiently transfected with EGFP fused to ABCA13 at its C terminus or EGFP alone (control) were incubated at 37 °C with ATTO594-conjugated GM1 or GM3 (33Komura N. Suzuki K.G. Ando H. Konishi M. Koikeda M. Imamura A. Chadda R. Fujiwara T.K. Tsuboi H. Sheng R. Cho W. Furukawa K. Yamauchi Y. Ishida H.

ATTO594-conjugated GM1 and GM3 were substantially accumulated in ABCA13 vesicles, but their internalization was scarcely observed in control cells. Cholera toxin subunit B conjugated to Alexa Fluor 555, which binds to gangliosides (34Cho J.A. Chinnapen D.J. Aamar E. te Welscher Y.M. Lencer W.I. Massol R. Insights on the trafficking and retro-translocation of glycosphingolipid-binding bacterial toxins.Front. Cell Infect Microbiol. 2012; 2: 51Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), was also delivered to ABCA13 vesicles (Fig. 3C). These results suggest ABCA13 also regulates the intracellular distribution of gangliosides. When cells were incubated with FM 4-64, a membrane-impermeant fluorescent lipid probe that is commonly used as a fluorescent reporter for endocytic vesicles and lipid trafficking (35Bandmann V. Mirsanaye A.S. Schäfer J. Thiel G. Holstein T. Mikosch-Wersching M. Membrane capacitance recordings resolve dynamics and complexity of receptor-mediated endocytosis in Wnt signalling.Sci.

Mol. Cell Biol. 2018; 10: 539-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), we found FM 4-64 was localized in ABCA13 vesicles (Fig. 3D). The ratio of cholesterol to choline phospholipids in HEK293 cells was not altered by ABCA13 expression (Fig. S2), indicating that ABCA13 did not affect cellular cholesterol content. These results suggest that ABCA13 accelerates the internalization of plasma-membrane lipids by endocytic retrograde transport. Previous studies reported that ABCA13 is also expressed as a short version lacking the long N-terminal region, starting from methionine at 2892 (5Maeß M.B. Stolle K. Cullen P. Lorkowski S.

Molecular structure and characterization of a novel murine ABC transporter, Abca13.Gene. 2003; 307: 191-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Therefore, we assessed whether the long N-terminal region is required for ABCA13 function. ABCA13 mutant without the N-terminal region (ABCA13 ΔNter, Fig. 4A) was generated and transfected into HEK293 cells. We confirmed that ABCA13 ΔNter was expressed as a 240 kDa protein (Fig. 4B) and that it showed reticular localization (Fig. 4C), suggesting that the N-terminal region is required for the localization of ABCA13 to intracellular vesicles. ABC proteins couple the energy of ATP binding and hydrolysis to a variety of biological functions (3Davidson A.L. Dassa E. Orelle C. Chen J. Structure, function, and evolution of bacterial ATP-binding cassette systems.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2008; 72: 317-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar). We examined whether cholesterol internalization was dependent on ATP hydrolysis by ABCA13. We constructed three mutants: a mutant bearing one point mutation in NBD1 (ABCA13 K3849M), one in NBD2 (ABCA13 K4735M), and point mutations in both NBDs (ABCA13MM), in which conserved lysine residues in the Walker A motif crucial for ATP binding and hydrolysis were replaced by methionine (37Takahashi K.

These mutant proteins were expressed at similar levels (Fig. 4B) and localized to the intracellular vesicles like ABCA13 WT (Fig. 4C). However, EGFP-D4 staining was scarcely observed with the ATP hydrolysis-deficient mutants (Fig. 4C). These results suggest that cholesterol internalization is dependent on ATP hydrolysis by ABCA13. To study the physiological role of ABCA13, we examined the effects of ABCA13 deletion on phenotypes by generating Abca13 KO mice using the CRISPR/Cas system on the genetic background of C57BL/6N strain (39Mashiko D. Fujihara Y. Satouh Y. Miyata H. Isotani A. Ikawa M. Generation of mutant mice by pronuclear injection of circular plasmid expressing Cas9 and single guided RNA.Sci.

Feasibility for a large scale mouse mutagenesis by injecting CRISPR/Cas plasmid into zygotes.Dev. Growth Differ. 2014; 56: 122-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To disrupt both full-size (5034 amino acids) and ΔNter (2143 amino acids) mouse Abca13, sgRNA was designed to target exon 21 of the Abca13 gene to induce frameshift mutations within the open reading frame (Fig. 5A). Plasmids expressing Cas9 and sgRNA against Abca13 were microinjected into zygotes of C57BL/6N mice, and Abca13 gene mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing analysis. We created a mutant line harboring an 83 bp deletion in exon 21, leading to a premature stop codon in exon 22. The genotyping PCR products were represented in 576 bp for WT and 493 bp for KO (Fig. 5B). Western blotting was performed using the kidney, brain, and bone marrow to confirm the deletion of ABCA13 protein (Fig. 5C). A major band of ABCA13 was detected at >460 kDa in WT mice but not in KO mice. The bands detected around 240 kDa in both WT and Abca13 KO mice were considered to be nonspecific, because the frameshift mutation was introduced within the open reading frame of ΔNter ABCA13 (Fig. 5A) and the predicted molecular mass of ΔNter mouse ABCA13 is 240 kDa. These results indicate that the 83 bp deletion induced by the CRISPR/Cas system resulted in the deletion of ABCA13 protein. Abca13 KO mice were born normally and seemed to have normal appearance and life span. Because it was suggested that genetic variants of human ABCA13 are related to psychiatric disorders (7Knight H.M.

One such example is the wing spot seen in male Drosophila biarmipes flies but not the female flies. Galouzis and Prud'homme investigate the X-linked yellow gene and its enhancer. Investigating the genetics of the trait, they found evidence that the male-specific phenotype is caused by a trans interaction between the enhancer and gene that silences the gene when it is present in only one copy in the male (which only has a single X chromosome) versus the two copies found in the female. This gene thus appears to be regulated by differing genomic interactions in male and female flies and is an example of the phenomenon known as transvection. Science , this issue p. 396"
https://openalex.org/W3125515415,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) is a master regulator of adipogenesis and lipogenesis. To understand its roles in fiber formation and fat deposition in skeletal muscle, we successfully generated muscle-specific overexpression of PPARγ in two pig models by random insertion and CRISPR/Cas9 transgenic cloning procedures. The content of intramuscular fat was significantly increased in PPARγ pigs while had no changes on lean meat ratio. PPARγ could promote adipocyte differentiation by activating adipocyte differentiating regulators such as FABP4 and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP), along with enhanced expression of LPL, FABP4, and PLIN1 to proceed fat deposition. Proteomics analyses demonstrated that oxidative metabolism of fatty acids and respiratory chain were activated in PPARγ pigs, thus, gathered more Ca2+ in PPARγ pigs. Raising of Ca2+ could result in increased phosphorylation of CAMKII and p38 MAPK in PPARγ pigs, which can stimulate MEF2 and PGC1α to affect fiber type and oxidative capacity. These results support that skeletal muscle-specific overexpression of PPARγ can promote oxidative fiber formation and intramuscular fat deposition in pigs."

We show that L. pneumophila Lart1 targets a specific class of 120-kDa NAD+-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) enzymes found in fungi and protists, including many natural hosts of Legionella. Lart1 targets a conserved arginine residue in the NAD+-binding pocket of GDH, thereby blocking oxidative deamination of glutamate.

Lart1 targets a conserved arginine residue in the NAD+-binding pocket of GDH, thereby blocking oxidative deamination of glutamate. Therefore, Lart1 could be the first example of a Legionella effector which directly targets a host metabolic enzyme during infection. Our lab has previously taken a bioinformatic approach to identify atypical and uncharacterized members of the protein kinase superfamily. Several of the outlying kinase families we have characterized are substrates of the Legionella pneumophila type IV secretion system (T4SS), including Legionella pneumophila gene (Lpg)2603 and substrate of icm/dot J (SidJ) (1Sreelatha A.

Legionella is a gram-negative environmental pathogen and the causative agent of a potentially fatal pneumonia called Legionnaire’s disease. The genus Legionella, through horizontal gene transfer from its hosts and cohabiting bacteria, has acquired over 18,000 translocated effectors representing at least 137 different eukaryotic-like domains (3Gomez-Valero L. Rusniok C. Carson D. Mondino S. Perez-Cobas A.E. Rolando M. Pasricha S. Reuter S. Demirtas J. Crumbach J. Descorps-Declere S. Hartland E.L. Jarraud S. Dougan G.

A. 2019; 116: 2265-2273Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). L. pneumophila alone translocates more than 330 effectors, accounting for about 10% of its proteome (4Burstein D. Amaro F.

Because these effectors have evolved to target conserved processes, they represent an orthogonal approach to interrogate eukaryotic biology. Furthermore, effectors are a rich source of structural and biochemical diversity; of the 99 conserved protein domains identified in L. pneumophila effectors, 46 are novel (4Burstein D. Amaro F.

Inspired by the SidE effectors, we sought to identify novel ART folds in the Legionella effector repertoire. Members of the ART superfamily transfer ADP-ribose (ADPR) from NAD+, joining the 1′ position of the ribose in N-, S-, or O- linked glycosidic bonds to diverse substrates including proteins, nucleic acids, and small molecules (19Corda D. Di Girolamo M. Functional aspects of protein mono-ADP-ribosylation.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1953-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). ARTs are widespread in nature, but have extensively diversified in conflict-related systems from bacteria (20Aravind L. Zhang D. de Souza R.F. Anand S. Iyer L.M. The natural history of ADP-ribosyltransferases and the ADP-ribosylation system.Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2015; 384: 3-32PubMed Google Scholar), including toxin–antitoxin, virus–host, symbiont–parasite, and antagonistic intraspecific interactions. While poly-ADP-ribosylation is found almost exclusively in multicellular eukaryotes, the prokaryotic ARTs transfer a single ADPR moiety to their substrates (21Hottiger M.O. Hassa P.O. Luscher B. Schuler H. Koch-Nolte F. Toward a unified nomenclature for mammalian ADP-ribosyltransferases.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2010; 35: 208-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Mono-ADP-ribosylation by bacterial toxins, including diphtheria, cholera, pertussis and iota-toxin from Clostridium perfringens, is a fundamental pathogenic mechanism for many serious human diseases (22Krueger K.M. Barbieri J.T. The family of bacterial ADP-ribosylating exotoxins.Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 8: 34-47Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The protein targets of the most well-known mono-ADP-Ribosyltransferase (mART) toxins include small regulatory G-proteins, actin, and components of eukaryotic translation. While the conventional function of ADP-ribosylation is to lock host proteins in a permanently active or inactive state, the SidE ART domain from Legionella reveals that ADP-ribosylation can be an intermediate for other types of unique chemistry. SidE is the only ART domain identified thus far among Legionella T4SS effectors. Here we have discovered a mono-ART fold in the Legionella effector Legionella ADP-Ribosyltransferase 1 (Lart1), which bears only 19% sequence identity with the SidE ART domain. Lart1 was identified as a substrate of the L. pneumophila T4SS in a screen based on translocation of a β-lactamase fusion (23Zhu W. Banga S. Tan Y. Zheng C. Stephenson R. Gately J. Luo Z.Q. Comprehensive identification of protein substrates of the Dot/Icm type IV transporter of Legionella pneumophila.PLoS One. 2011; 6e17638Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), but its activity and substrates are unknown. We applied a bioinformatic strategy to search for outlying members of the ART superfamily (Fig. S1). Using the FFAS sequence profile algorithm (24Xu D. Jaroszewski L. Li Z. Godzik A. FFAS-3D: Improving fold recognition by including optimized structural features and template re-ranking.Bioinformatics. 2014; 30: 660-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), we identified remote similarity to ARTs in the Lart1 family of proteins from the human pathogen Legionella. Its closest relatives by FFAS include butterfly DNA ART pierisin, Salmonella typhoid toxin, and pertussis toxin with 12 to 16% sequence identity and significant FFAS Z-scores between −10 and −11. The predicted ART domain of the L. pneumophila Lart1 lies between residues 1 and 174, while residues 174 to 304 are predicted to adopt a coiled-coil structure (Fig. 1A). Sequence alignments identified three conserved active site motifs (R37, 86SxS, and 135ExE), which place the Lart1 family in the R-S-E clade of mono-ARTs (mARTs) (20Aravind L. Zhang D. de Souza R.F. Anand S. Iyer L.M. The natural history of ADP-ribosyltransferases and the ADP-ribosylation system.Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2015; 384: 3-32PubMed Google Scholar, 25Domenighini M. Rappuoli R. Three conserved consensus sequences identify the NAD-binding site of ADP-ribosylating enzymes, expressed by eukaryotes, bacteria and T-even bacteriophages.Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 667-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). Deletion of Lart1 from L. pneumophila had no effect on bacterial replication in the amoeba A. castellani (Fig. 1C and Fig. S2). However, the Lart1 family is widespread in the Legionella genus. Eighteen of 48 sequenced Legionella species have a Lart1 ortholog (prevalence of 37%), making Lart1 part of the top 100 most common of Legionella effector families. Lart1 homologs were also found in three species belonging to the closely related Fluoribacter genus, but not in other organisms (Table S1). To identify substrates of this putative Legionella ART, we incubated purified recombinant Lart1 with yeast cell extracts and [32P]-adenylate NAD+. Lart1, but not the E137A mutant, incorporated 32P into a species in a yeast extract that migrated at ∼120 kDa during sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (Fig. 2A). There were no substrates labeled by Lart1 when mammalian cell lysates were tested (not shown). To identify the ∼120 kDa substrate, we repeated the labeling experiment with biotin-17-NAD+ and used streptavidin resin to enrich biotin-labeled proteins. Bound proteins were eluted by trypsinization and identified by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). We prioritized candidate substrates by only considering proteins enriched from reactions containing WT Lart1 but not the E137A mutant. This step eliminated the most abundant proteins identified in both streptavidin pull-downs, including several carboxylase enzymes, which are covalently modified by a biotin prosthetic group. The list of unique proteins was then sorted by MASCOT protein score. The top hit from this sorting was NAD+-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase 2 (Gdh2p, calculated molecular weight of 124.3 kDa) (Table S2). GDH enzymes can be broadly divided into four classes (26Minambres B. Olivera E.R. Jensen R.A. Luengo J.M. A new class of glutamate dehydrogenases (GDH). Biochemical and genetic characterization of the first member, the AMP-requiring NAD-specific GDH of Streptomyces clavuligerus.J. Biol.

Evolution of glutamate dehydrogenase genes: Evidence for lateral gene transfer within and between prokaryotes and eukaryotes.BMC Evol. Biol. 2003; 3: 14Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The two most common and by far most-studied GDH classes are small (∼50 kDa), hexameric enzymes with widespread phylogenetic distributions. These include the vertebrate GDH enzymes, which are extensively regulated by allosteric feedback (28Smith H.Q. Li C. Stanley C.A. Smith T.J. Glutamate dehydrogenase, a complex enzyme at a crucial metabolic branch point.Neurochem. Res. 2019; 44: 117-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). A third class of ∼180 kDa, NAD+-dependent GDH is found only in eubacteria. A fourth class of GDH comprises a group of tetrameric, ∼115 kDa enzymes found in fungi, protists, and some deltaproteobacteria (Fig. 2B). Yeast Gdh2p belongs to the 115-kDa class, catalyzes glutamate deamination, and confers a growth advantage with glutamate as a sole nitrogen source (29Miller S.M. Magasanik B. Role of NAD-linked glutamate dehydrogenase in nitrogen metabolism in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4927-4935Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Uno I. Matsumoto K. Adachi K. Ishikawa T. Regulation of NAD-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase by protein kinases in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1288-1293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although yeast also possess two GDH enzymes of the widespread 50-kDa class (31Avendano A. Deluna A. Olivera H. Valenzuela L. Gonzalez A. GDH3 encodes a glutamate dehydrogenase isozyme, a previously unrecognized route for glutamate biosynthesis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5594-5597Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32DeLuna A. Avendano A. Riego L. Gonzalez A. NADP-glutamate dehydrogenase isoenzymes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Purification, kinetic properties, and physiological roles.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43775-43783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), neither were identified in our streptavidin pulldowns. Notably, the 115-kDa class is also present in protozoa, the natural hosts of Legionella. We selected representative GDH enzymes for heterologous expression in E. coli and tested whether recombinant GDH are substrates of Lart1 in reactions containing [32P]-NAD+. Lart1 ADP-ribosylated yeast Gdh2p and Glud2 from the amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum (DdGlud2) but did not ADP-ribosylate human or Legionella GDH homologs, nor did it modify yeast Gdh1p (Fig. 2C). Thus, of the substrates we tested, only GDH enzymes of the 115-kDa class are recognized by Lart1. Lart1-dependent ADP ribosylation of DdGlud2 was time-dependent (Fig. S3A) and displayed a pH optimum of 6.0 and a slight preference for low (0–50 mM) salt (Fig. S3, B and C). Like the SidE mARTs (15Kalayil S. Bhogaraju S. Bonn F. Shin D. Liu Y. Gan N. Basquin J. Grumati P. Luo Z.Q. Dikic I. Insights into catalysis and function of phosphoribosyl-linked serine ubiquitination.Nature. 2018; 557: 734-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), Lart1 does not possess NAD+ glycohydrolase activity and only hydrolyzed etheno-NAD+ in the presence of its substrate (Fig. S3, D and E). Lart1 ADP ribosylation was inhibited by free nicotinamide in ≥ twofold excess of NAD+ (Fig. S3F). DdGlud2 was not ADP-ribosylated in reactions without ART enzyme or with ART domains from other Legionella effectors, and Lart1-catalyzed incorporation of etheno-ADP-ribose occurred even in the presence of excess unlabeled ADP-ribose (Fig. S4). We determined the kinetic parameters of Lart1 with DdGlud2 as a substrate. The Km for DdGlud2 was 2.22 μM (95% CI 1.54, 3.16) and the Km for NAD+ was 1.57 μM (95% CI 1.26, 1.95) (Fig. 3, A and B) , in accordance with eukaryotic cytosol NAD+ concentrations of ∼0.3 mM (33Yamada K. Hara N. Shibata T. Osago H. Tsuchiya M. The simultaneous measurement of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and related compounds by liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry.Anal. Biochem. 2006; 352: 282-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Lart1 has a turnover rate (Kcat) of 0.15 min−1 with respect to NAD+ and 0.11 min−1 with respect to DdGlud2. The turnover rate and catalytic efficiency of Lart1 are weaker than those of related mART toxins that target proteins, but comparable with members of the DNA-targeting Pierisin family (Table S3) (34Krska D.

After a 1.5 h reaction, intact mass analysis of DdGlud2 revealed compete stoichiometric addition of a single ADP ribose moiety (+541 Da) (Fig. 3C). Lart1 orthologs from four Legionella species including Legionella tucsonensis (Ltuc1293) Legionella sainthelensi (Lsai0094), Legionella anisa (Lani2348), and Legionella longbeachae (Llo2453) also ADP-ribosylated DdGlud2 in assays using both etheno-NAD+ and biotin-NAD+ as substrates (Fig. S5). To identify the modified residue of yeast Gdh2p, ADP-ribosylation was enzymatically converted to phosphoribosylation by snake venom phosphodiesterase to aid identification by mass spectrometry (38Daniels C.M. Ong S.E. Leung A.K. The promise of proteomics for the study of ADP-ribosylation.Mol. Cell. 2015; 58: 911-924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). LC-MS/MS identified neutral loss of the phosphoribose group in peptides corresponding to Gdh2p 791 to 804 (Fig. 4A). Three well-conserved residues in this peptide (E792, R795, and R800) were targeted by alanine mutagenesis, and only the R800 A mutant was not ADP-ribosylated by Lart1 (Fig. 4B). Mutation of the corresponding residue (R763) in DdGlud2 also abolished ADP-ribosylation by Lart1 (Fig. S6). There are presently no structures of GDHs of the 115-kDa class. However, the target Arg falls within the relatively well-conserved core nucleotide-binding domain, which can be confidently modeled based on structures of the 50 kDa-class GDHs. A model of DdGlud2 shows that R763 is positioned in a solvent-exposed “lid” within the NAD+-binding pocket, which closes over the ribose moiety when nucleotide is bound (Fig. 4C). R763 and the surrounding motif are strongly conserved within fungal and protist GDH enzymes but have diverged in GDH classes from metazoans and bacteria (Fig. 4D). Yeast Gdh2p is a predominately catabolic enzyme that uses NAD+ as a cofactor and catalyzes the oxidative deamination of glutamate (29Miller S.M. Magasanik B. Role of NAD-linked glutamate dehydrogenase in nitrogen metabolism in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4927-4935Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Uno I. Matsumoto K. Adachi K. Ishikawa T. Regulation of NAD-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase by protein kinases in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1288-1293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Amoeba GDHs are less well characterized and have not been purified to homogeneity, but NAD+-dependent, catabolic GDH activity has been partially purified from the cytosol of D. discoideum (39Langridge W.H. Komuniecki P. DeToma F.J. Isolation and regulatory properties of two glutamate dehydrogenases from the cellular slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 178: 581-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and A. castellani (40Hellebust J.A. Larochelle J.

The regulation of amino-acid-metabolism during hyperosmotic stress in Acanthamoeba-castellanii.J. Exp. Zool. 1987; 243: 365-378Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We cloned and purified the 115-kDa class GDH from the soil amoeba D. discoideum, which shares 38% sequence identity with yeast Gdh2p. The recombinant enzyme has a subunit M.W. of 117.1 kDa and elutes primarily with mr of 212 kDa (Fig. S7), suggesting a dimer. DdGlud2 reduced NAD+ in the presence of glutamic acid and oxidized NADH in the presence of ammonia and ɑ-KG. Rate plots with varying glutamate and ɑ-KG concentrations are shown in Fig. S8, A and B. The rate plot for glutamate was roughly hyperbolic and indicates a Km of 18.53 mM (95% CI 10.72, 32.15). ɑ-KG appears to elicit substrate inhibition at concentrations above 50 mM, and the rate plot could not be fit to Michaelis–Menten kinetics. As expected, DdGlud2 did not utilize NADP+ as a cofactor. With substrate concentrations held near Km, its rate was not affected by ATP or CTP, but was stimulated 2.5-fold by GTP (Fig. S8C). ADP-ribosylated DdGlud2 (ADPR-DdGlud2) was prepared in reactions with Lart1 and purified by gel filtration chromatography. In glutamate oxidation assays, ADPR-DdGlud2 was completely inactivated; its catalytic constant was reduced to <1% that of the unmodified enzyme (Fig. 5A). Similarly, in reverse reactions with ɑ-KG, ammonia, and NADH, ADPR-DdGlud2 lost detectable activity (Fig. 5B). Thus, ADP-ribosylation of host GDH by Lart1 potently inactivates its metabolic function, likely by occluding the NAD+-binding pocket with an ADP-ribose moiety. We have identified Lart1 as the second Legionella effector harboring ART activity, the first being the ART domain in the SidE family of all-in-one ubiquitin ligases. The two types of ART domains are only remotely similar and perform very different functions. This highlights the pathogen’s ingenuity in evolving and repurposing specific enzymatic activities. To our knowledge, Lart1 is also the first Legionella effector identified that may target a host metabolic enzyme during infection. Vertebrate GDH is subject to regulation by ADP-ribosylation, presumably as a mechanism to fine-tune insulin secretion (42Ahuja N. Schwer B. Carobbio S. Waltregny D. North B.J. Castronovo V.

However, this ADP-ribosylation is catalyzed by sirtuin 4, which does not adopt an ART fold, occurs on a cysteine residue, and imparts reversible and partial enzyme inhibition (43Herrero-Yraola A.

https://openalex.org/W3125042158,"Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) is a major human health issue for which there are limited treatment options. Experimental evidence suggests that nutrition plays an important role in ALD pathogenesis, and specific dietary fatty acids, for example, n6 or n3-PUFAs, may exacerbate or attenuate ALD, respectively. The purpose of the current study was to determine whether the beneficial effects of n3-PUFA enrichment in ALD were mediated, in part, by improvement in Wnt signaling. Wild-type (WT) and fat-1 transgenic mice (that endogenously convert n6-PUFAs to n3) were fed ethanol (EtOH) for 6 weeks followed by a single LPS challenge. fat-1 mice had less severe liver damage than WT littermates as evidenced by reduced plasma alanine aminotransferase, hepatic steatosis, liver tissue neutrophil infiltration, and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. WT mice had a greater downregulation of Axin2, a key gene in the Wnt pathway, than fat-1 mice in response to EtOH and LPS. Further, there were significant differences between WT and fat-1 EtOH+LPS-challenged mice in the expression of five additional genes linked to the Wnt signaling pathway, including Apc, Fosl1/Fra-1, Mapk8/Jnk-1, Porcn, and Nkd1. Compared to WT, primary hepatocytes isolated from fat-1 mice exhibited more effective Wnt signaling and were more resistant to EtOH-, palmitic acid-, or TNFα-induced cell death. Further, we demonstrated that the n3-PUFA-derived lipid mediators, resolvins D1 and E1, can regulate hepatocyte expression of several Wnt-related genes that were differentially expressed between WT and fat-1 mice. These data demonstrate a novel mechanism by which n3-PUFAs can ameliorate ALD."
https://openalex.org/W3123850793,"South Africa is a megadiverse country with three globally recognised biodiversity hotspots within its borders. Bees in particular show high diversity and endemism in the western part of the country. Not much is currently known about the floral host preferences of indigenous bees in South Africa, with data only available from observational studies. Pollen metabarcoding provides provenance information by utilising DNA analyses instead of floral visitation and traditional microscopic identification to identify pollinator food plants, which can be time consuming and imprecise. In this study, we sampled pollen from leaf-cutter bees (Megachilidae) specimens maintained in a historic insect collection (National Collection of Insects, South Africa) that were originally collected from two florally important areas in South Africa (Succulent Karoo and Savanna) and used metabarcoding to determine pollen provenance. We also sampled pollen from leafcutter bee species with wider distributions, that extend across many different biomes, to determine if these ‘generalist’ species show relaxed floral host specificity in some biomes. Metabarcoding involved sequencing of the nuclear internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) region. Amplicons were compared to a sequence reference database to assign taxonomic classifications to family level. Sequence reads were also clustered to OTUs based on 97% sequence similarity to estimate numbers of plant species visited. We found no significant difference in the mean number of plant taxa visited in the Succulent Karoo and Savanna regions, but the widespread group visited significantly more floral hosts. Bees from the widespread group were also characterised by a significantly different composition in pollen assemblage. The time since specimens were collected did not have an effect on the mean number of taxa visited by any of the bee species studied. This study highlights national history collections as valuable sources of temporal and spatial biodiversity data."

Tuberculosis (TB), caused by the bacterial pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is now the leading cause of death from a single infectious agent world-wide claiming over 1.5 million lives each year (https://www.who.int/teams/global-tuberculosis-programme/tb-reports). Mtb is a highly successful intracellular pathogen, which has co-evolved over thousands of years to enable it to adapt within the human host and develop highly effective strategies to persist and survive (1Gagneux S. Host-pathogen coevolution in human tuberculosis.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2012; 367: 850-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). To thrive within this nutrient-restricted host environment, Mtb must access scarce energy sources; however, the precise nutritional requirements of Mtb and the mechanisms of assimilation are poorly understood (2Niederweis M.

Unraveling the processes and transporters in Mtb involved in nutrient scavenging and the import of these critical energy sources should lead to new intervention strategies to combat this major global pathogen. For many pathogens, carbohydrates are critical carbon sources for the production of energy and essential biomolecules, which are required for a wide range of cellular processes. However, the diversity and availability of sugars to Mtb during infection remain largely unclear (2Niederweis M.

Trehalose (α-D-glucopyranosyl-α-D-glucopyranoside, α,α-trehalose) is an unusual nonmammalian disaccharide that is highly abundant in mycobacteria (4Elbein A.D. Mitchell M. Levels of glycogen and trehalose in Mycobacterium smegmatis and the purification and properties of the glycogen synthetase.J. Bacteriol. 1973; 113: 863-873Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Trehalose-containing glycolipids are major components of the mycobacterial cell envelope that contribute to the virulence of the Mtb pathogen and provide an extracellular source of “free” trehalose which can be used as a carbon and energy source (5Jackson M.

Recent studies in mutant strains of Mtb have demonstrated that the LpqY-SugABC (Rv1235-Rv1238) ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter recognizes trehalose and enables the recovery and recycling of this liberated cell wall disaccharide that would otherwise be lost (6Kalscheuer R. Weinrick B. Veeraraghavan U. Besra G.S. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Trehalose-recycling ABC transporter LpqY-SugA-SugB-SugC is essential for virulence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Mutants of Mtb that lack functional components of the LpqY-SugABC importer are attenuated in mice infection models demonstrating the critical importance of trehalose uptake for Mtb virulence (6Kalscheuer R.

Given that trehalose import is fundamental for virulence and essential for Mtb to survive, the Mtb trehalose transporter is an attractive target for inhibitor design. Despite the importance of trehalose uptake in mycobacteria, the molecular details that govern how this disaccharide are recognized and whether alternative sugars are substrates for this recycling system remain unresolved. Some understanding into the substrate preference of this mycobacterial ABC-transporter can be obtained from studies which found that modified trehalose analogs retaining the α1-1-glycosidic linkage are actively imported by the LpqY-SugABC recycling system and metabolically incorporated into the trehalose-mycolates located within the cell envelope (11Backus K.M.

Soc. 2012; 134: 16123-16126Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Whether the mycobacterial LpqY-SugABC transporter is able to facilitate the import of alternative, more diverse, sugars is not yet known. Here, we have used a combination of chemical, biochemical, and biophysical approaches to describe the functional and structural characterization of the mycobacterial LpqY substrate binding domain of the LpqY-SugABC ABC transporter and reveal its substrate specificity and the molecular framework that underpins the recognition of trehalose and related substrates. These findings offer fundamental insights into how mycobacteria recognize and import trehalose, a critical process in virulence and survival of the Mtb pathogen. The optimal conditions for the production of Mtb LpqY and mycobacterial LpqY homologs were explored extensively in Escherichia coli. This yielded LpqY from Mycobacterium thermoresistible (Mtr), which has high sequence identity (72%) to Mtb LpqY at the amino acid level (Fig. S1). Soluble Mtr LpqY protein was readily obtained and purified using Ni2+-affinity and size-exclusion chromatography (Fig. S2), and the identity of the Mtr LpqY protein was confirmed by mass spectrometry. To establish whether the LpqY-SugABC transporter is specific for trehalose or is instead promiscuous for other carbohydrates, a panel of monosaccharides and disaccharides (10 mM) were screened for their ability to stabilize the melting temperature (Tm) of the Mtr LpqY substrate binding domain. In total, 62 potential substrates were probed, and the observed change in the melting temperature (ΔTm) of Mtr LpqY was assessed, which can be indicative of binding (Fig. 1, Figs. S3 and S4). Notably, trehalose resulted in the highest thermal shift (ΔTm 11.5 °C) of Mtr LpqY relative to the protein alone and compared with all substrates tested, indicating that Mtr LpqY has a clear preference for this physiologically relevant sugar (Fig. S3). Next, we probed whether modified trehalose analogs known to be imported by mycobacteria, including 2H-trehalose, 2-azido-2-deoxy-α,α′-trehalose (2-azido-trehalose), 4-azido-4-deoxy-α,α′-trehalose (4-azido-trehalose), 6-azido-6-deoxy-α,α′-trehalose (6-azido-trehalose), α-D-mannopyranosyl-(1→1)-α-D-glucopyranoside (mannotrehalose), and α-D-galactopyranosyl-(1→1)-α-D-glucopyranoside (galactotrehalose) (see SI methods for synthetic details), are substrates of Mtr LpqY (11Backus K.M.

Deuterated carbohydrate probes as 'label-free' substrates for probing nutrient uptake in mycobacteria by nuclear reaction analysis.Chem. Commun. 2015; 51: 4838-4841Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All of these disaccharides influenced the melting temperature of Mtr LpqY but to a lesser extent (Fig. 1). In addition to 6-azido-trehalose, we tested 6-amino-6-deoxy-α,α′-trehalose (6-amino-trehalose) and trehalose-6-phosphate to probe whether alternative moieties at this position are tolerated. The amino-group has a similar ΔTm shift to 6-azido-trehalose, whereas the larger phosphate group had less impact. To determine the importance of the azide-group position, we tested 2-, 3-, 4- and 6-azido trehalose analogs. 4-azido-trehalose had the highest ΔTm shift, which is comparable to trehalose. 6-azido-trehalose and 3-azido-trehalose had ΔTm shifts in a similar range, whereas 2-azido-trehalose showed only a minor shift. Thus, azide-trehalose analogs are recognized but to different extents. We then asked if Mtr LpqY recognizes other sugars. This analysis highlighted the importance of the stereochemistry of the α1,1-glycosidic bond in substrate recognition as there was a reduction in recognition of α,β-trehalose, with a αβ1-1 linkage, and almost complete loss of recognition of β,β-trehalose where the two glucose units are orientated through a β1-1 glycosidic bond. Furthermore, the regiochemistry of the glycosidic bond is crucial for substrate recognition and replacement of the preferred α1,1 linkage with either an α1-2 (kojibiose), α1-3 (nigerose), α1-4 (maltose), or α1-6 (isomaltose) glycosidic bond resulted in reduced ΔTm shifts (Fig. 1). In marked contrast, all of the other disaccharides and monosaccharides evaluated, including the glucose monosaccharide subunit of trehalose, had no influence on the ΔTm indicating that these sugars are unlikely to be substrates (Fig. S3). It is particularly noteworthy that the single glucose unit is not recognized in these assay conditions, suggesting that a disaccharide is required for substrate binding and recognition to occur. To validate our findings from the thermal shift screening the binding interactions of Mtr LpqY were assessed with the disaccharide substrates that resulted in the largest thermal shift. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments were performed with the preferred trehalose substrate and also with galactotrehalose, which was found to result in a ∼2-fold reduction in the ΔTm of Mtr LpqY compared with trehalose. ITC analysis revealed a 1:1 binding stoichiometry for both sugars:Mtr LpqY and equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) of 1.1 ± 0.04 μM and 2.1 ± 0.2 μΜ respectively (Fig. S5). This is in agreement with the range of reported Kd values determined by ITC for substrate binding domains of other ABC transporters (15Berntsson R.P. Smits S.H. Schmitt L. Slotboom D.J. Poolman B.

Kanaujia S.P. Structural and thermodynamic correlation illuminates the selective transport mechanism of disaccharide alpha-glycosides through ABC transporter.FEBS J. 2020; 287: 1576-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). This provides direct evidence that this mycobacterial importer is a high-affinity trehalose transporter. We also tested the binding affinity of trehalose by microscale thermophoresis (MST) and confirmed that binding is also in the micromolar range, with an observed Kd value of 72 μM (Table 1, Fig. S6). Given that MST consumes significantly less protein than ITC, we therefore used the MST assay to evaluate the binding affinities of the other sugar substrates. The Kd values obtained are reported in Table 1. Among all of the substrates tested, we were able to determine binding affinities for 2H-trehalose, 2-, 3-, 4- and 6-azido-trehalose, galactotrehalose, mannotrehalose, and kojibiose. As expected, the Kd value for the deuterated 2H-trehalose analog was comparable to trehalose, whereas the modified trehalose derivatives displayed slightly weaker binding affinities. This is consistent with the use of azido-modified trehalose tools developed to evaluate trehalose metabolism in mycobacteria (13Swarts B.M. Holsclaw C.M. Jewett J.C. Alber M. Fox D.M. Siegrist M.S.

In these studies, we observed that the asymmetric epimeric analogs, galactotrehalose and mannotrehalose, showed an ∼3 and ∼12-fold reduction in binding affinity respectively. These findings are compatible with our recent studies in Mycobacterium smegmatis which, unexpectedly, showed that 6-azido-galactotrehalose is incorporated into the mycobacterial cell envelope with a similar efficiency as 6-azido-trehalose via the M. smegmatis LpqY-SugABC transporter (12Parker H.L.

This result indicates that Mtr LpqY is able to tolerate epimerization of the hydroxy group at the 4-position, whereas epimerization at the 2-position is less favored. The preference for the α1-1 glycosidic bond was further confirmed through evaluation of alternative α-glycoside disaccharides. The binding affinity for these analogs could only be determined for kojibiose (α1-2) under these assay conditions with a ∼30-fold increase in the Kd. value observed. We were unable to obtain reliable Kd values for nigerose and isomaltose because of low signal to noise ratios, suggesting that sugars with α1-3 and α1-6 glycosidic bonds have reduced binding affinities and are not recognized.

Taken together, these data establish that the Mtr LpqY substrate binding protein is highly specific for trehalose. To determine the molecular and structural basis of trehalose recognition, we solved the crystal structure of Mtr LpqY with the trehalose substrate present (Fig. 2). The Mtr LpqY-trehalose complex crystallized in space group P412121, and the structure was determined by exploiting the anomalous signal from iodide-soaked crystals. The model containing bound iodine ions was then used as a search model to solve the structure of a native, higher-resolution, data set by molecular replacement, and the final Mtr LpqY-trehalose complex structure was refined at a resolution of 1.7 Å to an Rwork of 16.9% and Rfree of 19.4% (see Table S1 for the data collection and refinement statistics). Two Mtr LpqY protein molecules are present within the asymmetric unit. Structural superposition indicates that each subunit is equivalent, aligning with a r.m.s.d. of 0.45 Å over all residues, whereas crystal packing and analysis of the crystal packing interfaces indicates that Mtr LpqY does not form dimers or higher oligomers (20Krissinel E.

Therefore, it is likely that the monomer is the biologically relevant unit, which is consistent with the known oligomeric state of substrate binding domains from other ABC transporters (22Locher K.P.

Lycklama A.N.J.A. Poolman B. An updated structural classification of substrate-binding proteins.FEBS Lett. 2016; 590: 4393-4401Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The overall architecture of Mtr LpqY is typical of substrate-binding domains of ABC transporters, consisting of two globular α/β domains joined by a hinge region (23Scheepers G.H. Lycklama A.N.J.A. Poolman B. An updated structural classification of substrate-binding proteins.FEBS Lett. 2016; 590: 4393-4401Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), which in this instance is formed from three flexible loops. Domain I (residues 14–132 and 335–400) and domain II (residues 137–317 and 409–448) both comprise of a central β-sheet that is flanked on both sides by α-helices. The two lobes are connected via three flexible loops: Thr132-Leu137 (loop 1), Ala317-Leu335 (loop 2), and Asn400-Val409 (loop 3). The Mtr LpqY-trehalose complex adopts a closed conformation, which is further stabilized through a central arginine residue within the hinge region (Arg404, loop 3) that forms interdomain hydrogen bonds with the carbonyl oxygen of Leu332 located on loop 2 and the carboxylate of Glu179 from domain 2 as well as being directly involved with substrate binding. The trehalose molecule was clearly defined in the electron density and resides within the acidic binding cleft formed between domains I and II and interacts with residues from both domains (Fig. 2, Fig. S7). Trehalose comprises two glucopyranosyl units connected by a α1,1-glycosidic bond. In the Mtr LpqY structure, both of the glucose rings adopt a classical 4C1 chair conformation with almost equivalent dihedral angles across the glycosidic bonds (φH: 63.2°, ψH 65.4°), thus having rotational symmetry about the central glycosidic oxygen atom, mimicking the conformation of anhydrous trehalose crystallized in the absence of protein (24Jeffrey G.A. Nanni R. The crystal structure of anhydrous alpha,alpha-trehalose at -150 degrees.Carbohydr. Res. 1985; 137: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In Mtr LpqY, trehalose is orientated such that one glucose molecule (Glc-1) is buried at the base of the binding cleft in close proximity to the hinge-region containing Arg404, whereas the second glucose molecule (Glc-2) extends outwards toward the entrance of the binding channel (Fig. 3). The disaccharide is anchored into place through a significant network of hydrogen bonds in which all sugar hydroxyl groups participate, with additional hydrogen bond interactions formed through the ring oxygen of Glc-1 as well as the glycosidic oxygen atom. The buried Glc-1 molecule is orientated to interact with the side chains of Asp80, Asn134, Glu241, Trp259, Arg404, and with the backbone amide of Gly334. The second glucose molecule (Glc-2) is stabilized through direct hydrogen bond interactions with Asn25, Glu26, Gln59, and Asn134. Water interactions are also observed with both C6-hydroxyl groups, the glycosidic oxygen atom as well as an intraglucose bridging water between the C6-hydroxyl group of Glc-1 and the C2-hydroxyl group of Glc-2. Hydrophobic interactions provide additional stabilization between the indole side chain of Trp259 and Glc-1, with potential van der Waals interactions between the side chains of Trp261 and Leu371 with Glc-2. Recognition of trehalose appears to be largely driven through accommodation of this ligand within a binding pocket where substrate selectivity is underpinned through an extensive hydrogen bonding network. These interactions have a pronounced effect on substrate recognition and dictate the stringent stereoselective requirement for an α1,1-linked disaccharide. All of the residues that interact with trehalose are conserved in Mtb LpqY with the exception of residues Asn25 and Glu26 that are located on a short-loop region comprising four residues formed between β1 and α1. In Mtb, Asn25 and Glu26 are instead replaced with a threonine and an aspartic acid residue, respectively, so while the residues are slightly smaller, the properties of the side chains are maintained. Evaluating the sequence alignment of mycobacterial LpqY homologs reveals a much greater sequence divergence among these nonconserved loop residues, suggesting a degree of flexibility of substrate recognition in this region, though an acidic residue is always found at position 26 (Fig. S8). To complement our structural studies and understand the functional importance of residues coordinating trehalose within the Mtr LpqY binding pocket point mutations were introduced to substitute nine individual residues to an alanine (Table 2). Two further residues, Asp25 and Glu26, in the short loop region that interacts with Glc-2, were mutated to threonine and aspartic acid, respectively, to replicate the Mtb LpqY binding-site. Proper folding was assessed by circular dichroism, and we determined these mutations were not detrimental to correct folding except for the Asp80Ala mutant, which was inherently less stable, and had a distinctive circular dichroism profile (Fig. S9). The corresponding aspartic acid residue (Asp70) in T. thermophilus has been implicated in enabling the closure of domains I and II upon substrate binding, which may explain the instability of this particular Mtr LpqY mutant (17Chandravanshi M. Gogoi P. Kanaujia S.P. Structural and thermodynamic correlation illuminates the selective transport mechanism of disaccharide alpha-glycosides through ABC transporter.FEBS J. 2020; 287: 1576-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The MST was used to determine the binding affinities of each site-directed Mtr LpqY mutant protein with trehalose. Complete abrogation of binding was observed when Glu241, Trp259, and Arg404 were replaced by alanine and a significant ∼100-fold increase in Kd observed for Asn134, highlighting that these residues are essential for substrate recognition and binding. In contrast, binding of trehalose was still observed when Asn25, Glu26, Gln59, and Leu335 were replaced by an alanine, with a corresponding ∼3-fold reduction in Kd for the Asn25 and Glu26 mutants and ∼10- and ∼13-fold reduction in the Kd values for Gln59 and Leu335, respectively, compared with wild-type Mtr LpqY. This indicates that while these amino acids are important for binding, mutations within these regions can be tolerated and are less critical for trehalose recognition. Examination of the sequence alignments reveals that the Asp25 and Glu26 residues are not conserved between mycobacterial homologs and that an alanine residue at position 25 naturally occurs in Mycobacterium marinum LpqY (Fig. S8). In contrast, the Mtr Lp"

Systemic lupus erythematosus and multiple sclerosis lead to a heightened risk for hematological malignancies and decreased risk for breast, ovarian, and prostate malignancies. Often patients with autoimmune disease have dysregulated antiviral immune responses, including against oncogenic viruses. To uncover the relationship between viral incidence and cancer risk in the context of autoimmune disease, we extracted electronic health records (EHR) from Vanderbilt University. ICD-9/10 codes and laboratory values were collected for hematological, lung, anal-vaginal, thyroid, hepatobiliary, bladder, prostate, and breast cancers; and viruses including Epstein Barr virus (EBV), Human papilloma virus (HPV), and Hepatitis A/B/C (Hep). Only viral infections that led to a physician visit or laboratory test were entered into the EMR; therefore, only clinically relevant cases were noted and considered positive in this study. The relationship between virus infection and cancer in an SLE cohort (SLE-cases n = 2,313, and SLE-controls n = 5,702) and an MS cohort (MS-case n = 7,277, MS-control n = 7,277) was examined by multilinear logistic regression. Viral infection was strongly associated with increased risk for cancer overall. SLE and MS patients were more susceptible to all viral infections. MS patients trended toward increased risk for cancers overall, while decreased risk for hormone-based cancers in SLE patients non-significantly reduced their risk for overall cancer. Both SLE and MS patients had increased clinically relevant EBV infection, which was associated with risk for hematological cancers. Preventing viral infections by vaccination may be especially helpful in controlling risk for cancer in SLE and MS patients."
https://openalex.org/W3122250951,"I logged onto a video call last month, not knowing what to expect. Faculty members in my department had just 1 day's notice of the meeting with our dean, which made me wonder, “Is it another budget cut—or worse?” After a quick apology, the dean pivoted to the news: Given the crunch on university finances amid the COVID-19 pandemic, he'd made a difficult decision to terminate the geology department. If we wanted to keep our jobs, we'd have to find another department willing to take us in. His words hit me like a ton of bricks. For 20 years—ever since I received tenure—I assumed I'd always have a job if I kept up my teaching and research. But the pandemic had brought long-standing problems to a head.



> “The quality of our research wasn't enough to save us.” 

Three years ago, the same dean had asked us for help. His budget was in the red because enrollments were falling and a new budget system had moved money out of his college. The geology department had a few large, popular courses, but many of our upper-level classes were highly specialized, attracting only a handful of students. Fewer than 10 students a year majored in geology. We needed larger class sizes and more students to enroll as majors, the dean told us.

We convened faculty meetings to discuss how to move forward. Our curriculum hadn't changed much in decades. Our students learned how to identify rocks and stare down microscopes, but they weren't much exposed to many of the more pressing problems in geosciences, such as climate change and groundwater pollution. Some of us, including me, wanted to overhaul the curriculum. But others argued against abandoning our focus on traditional skills and concepts.

We ended up making changes only around the edges. We added new elective courses on climate, medical geology, and extraterrestrial life, which attracted hundreds of students—many from other departments. But we didn't change the course requirements for geology majors, and many professors continued to teach the same material in the same way. The number of majors didn't budge.

Then came COVID-19. We stayed open and taught students on campus, but enrollments continued to fall. We expected administrators to make cuts, but we did not think entire departments would be axed—especially not ours. Our seven professors collectively bring in hundreds of thousands of federal research dollars every year and publish dozens of papers. But the overhead from our grants did not make up for the lack of tuition dollars. The quality of our research wasn't enough to save us.

After the meeting with our dean, my mind raced. What would become of our labs, our grad students, and all the projects in full swing? I had a secondary faculty appointment in a different college on campus, so I might be able to work there and avoid leaving the town where I'd lived for 27 years. But I didn't want to leave my geology colleagues. I wanted a solution that kept us together as a team.

Two days after the dean's call, I spoke with a university administrator who prodded me to not give up and asked, “What's your vision?” I spent the weekend speaking with my colleagues and brainstorming a plan. Together, we imagined a wholly new earth science curriculum, one that would prepare students for the challenges of today. We'd rethink all of our courses from scratch, focusing on problems that students—and their potential employers—care about. For instance, instead of simply teaching how rocks crack and weather away, we'd explore how those cracks affect the movement of polluted groundwater.

Our new vision looks to the future and leaves the past behind, something we could never bring ourselves to do before the prospect of termination forced us to spring into action. We're not sure how the university will react to our plan. Hopefully, our efforts aren't coming too late.

I hope academics elsewhere can learn from our mistakes and take a hard look at their own offerings to make sure they're serving the current generation of students. It's hard to overhaul a department and develop entirely new courses. But it's much harder if you wait until a crisis to act."

Prior studies have shown that people can use such drawings to perceive 3D shapes reliably, but it is not clear how useful this kind of contour information actually is in a real dynamical scene in which people interact with objects. To address this issue, we developed an Augmented Reality (AR) device that can show a participant a contour-drawing or a grayscale-image of a real dynamical scene in an immersive manner. We compared the performance of people in a variety of run-of-the-mill tasks with both contour-drawings and grayscale-images under natural viewing conditions in three behavioral experiments. The results of these experiments showed that the people could perform almost equally well with both types of images. This contour information may be sufficient to provide the basis for our visual system to obtain much of the 3D information needed for successful visuomotor interactions in our everyday life."

Understanding the relation between size and yield of dry product is essential for resource conservation and for economic purposes. In this study, stock-specific mass and length recovery rates were estimated for C . frondosa captured by dredging or diving at various depths and seasons on the South shore of the St. Lawrence Estuary, along Gaspé Peninsula, and processed in a commercial plant. The processing yield in dry product mass per sea cucumber was more than 1.5 times larger for sea cucumbers collected at 26–47 m depth compared to those collected at 9–16 m depth. Within each strata, there was little variation in the processed body mass, seasonally or spatially. Recovery rates based on gutted mass for this stock (13.4─14.5%) varied little among depths and seasons, despite observed seasonal and bathymetric variation in reproductive status. In contrast, recovery rates based on whole body mass and length were highly variable both seasonally and spatially. Stress related to dredging or post-capture handling induced important variable body contraction and water content, leading to variation in body length, mass and shape of sea cucumbers having the same processed body mass. Gutted mass was the best metric to predict processed body mass and to estimate size whereas whole body length was the least reliable. New stock-specific information on variability of body mass, length, and recovery rates induced by capture, and on seasonal and bathymetric variation in reproductive status and processing yields will be used for the design of future stock assessment surveys, and for stock conservation."
https://openalex.org/W3124063040,"Leukotriene B4 receptor type 2 (BLT2) is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) mainly expressed in epithelial cells, where it enhances barrier function. A unique characteristic of BLT2 is its restricted localization to the lateral membrane. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the localization of BLT2 to the lateral membrane and the physiological roles of laterally localized BLT2 are unknown. BLT1 is the most homologous GPCR to BLT2 and localizes to both the apical and lateral membranes. In this study, we generated chimeric receptors of BLT2 and BLT1 as well as deletion mutants of BLT2 to determine the region(s) of BLT2 responsible for its localization. Chimeric receptors containing the C-terminal domain of BLT2 localized only to the lateral membrane, and the C-terminal deletion mutant of BLT2 accumulated at the Golgi apparatus. Furthermore, the middle and C-terminal regions of BLT2 were important for maintaining epithelial barrier function. Proteomics analysis using the chimeric BLT-ascorbate peroxidase 2 biotinylation method showed that some proteins involved in intracellular protein transport, cell-cell junctions, and actin filament binding were located very close to the C-terminal domain of BLT2. Knockdown of lin-7 homolog C (LIN7C), a membrane trafficking protein, led to accumulation of BLT2 in the Golgi apparatus, resulting in diminished epithelial barrier function. These results suggest that the C-terminal region of BLT2 plays an important role in the transport of BLT2 from the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane in a LIN7C-dependent manner."

https://openalex.org/W3122208244,"Despite broad consensus that high-skilled immigration can contribute to innovation and economic growth (1–3), there is considerable controversy regarding how to reform immigration policies, including for workers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) professions. Much attention has centered on entry-level IT workers (4, 5), but less consideration has been given to the visa pathways of STEM doctorates (6, 7) who, unlike entry-level IT workers, can bring firms advanced training at the frontiers of science and technology and contribute disproportionately to innovation and entrepreneurship relative to workers with bachelor's or master's degrees (3). We provide new insights on the visa progression, qualifications, and starting salaries of STEM doctorates in the U.S. context from a survey that follows a cohort of 1597 U.S. citizen (69.7%) and foreign-born (30.3%) science and engineering Ph.D.'s from U.S. research universities into their first-time industry R&D employment [see details in the supplementary materials (SM)]. We show that the H-1B visa has become the predominant first step for STEM Ph.D.'s employed in industrial R&D, not because it is legally required or the most suitable visa but because of inefficiencies and delays on the path to permanent residency. Our findings show that the H-1B—a highly contentious visa used primarily for entry-level workers—may be an inefficient pathway for U.S.-trained STEM doctorates and suggest the need to rethink visa policies to retain these highly specialized workers."
https://openalex.org/W3122450564,"Benign ethnic neutropenia (BEN) is defined as a neutrophil count of &lt;1.5×10 9 cells/L in healthy individuals and is more common in populations of certain ethnicities, e.g. African or Middle Eastern ethnicity. Neutrophil values are commonly included in eligibility criteria for research participation, but little is known about the relationship between BEN, HIV acquisition, and the occurrence of adverse events during clinical trials. We investigated these relationships using data from an HIV vaccine efficacy trial of healthy adults from 5 South African sites. We analysed data from the double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial HVTN 503, and its follow-on study HVTN 503-S to assess the prevalence of BEN, its association with HIV infection, and adverse event reporting. These data were then compared with a time- and age-matched, non-pregnant cohort from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) conducted between 2007–2008 in the United States (US). The 739 South African participants had a median age of 22.0 years (interquartile range = 20–26) and 56% (n = 412) were male. Amongst the US cohort of 845 participants, the median age was 26 (IQR: 21–30) and the majority (54%, 457/745) were also male. BEN was present at enrolment in 7.0% (n = 52) of South African participants (6% in the placebo group versus 8% in the vaccine group); 81% (n = 42) of those with BEN were male. Pretoria North had the highest prevalence of BEN (11.6%, 5/43), while Cape Town had the lowest (0.7%, 1/152). Participants with BEN had a lower median neutrophil count (1.3 vs. 3.2x10 9 cells/L; p&lt;0.001) and BMI (20.8 vs. 22.3 kg/m 2 ; p&lt;0.001) when compared to those without BEN. A greater proportion of Black South Africans had neutrophil counts &lt;1.5×10 9 cells/L compared to US non-Hispanic Whites from the NHANES cohort (7% [52/739] vs. 0.6% [3/540]; p&lt;0.001). BEN did not increase the odds for HIV infection (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.364, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 0.625–2.976; p = 0.4351). However, female gender (aOR: 1.947, 95% CI: 1.265–2.996; p = 0.0025) and cannabis use (aOR: 2.192, 95% CI: 1.126–4.266; p = 0.0209) increased the odds of HIV acquisition. The incidence rates of adverse events were similar between participants in the placebo group with BEN, and those without: 12.1 (95% CI: 7.3–20.1) vs. 16.5 (95% CI: 14.6–18.7; p = 0.06) events per 100 person-years (py) were noted in the infections and infestations system organ class, respectively. The vaccine group had an event incidence rate of 19.7 (95% CI: 13.3–29.2) vs. 14.8 (95% CI: 13.0–16.8; p = 0.07) events per 100py in the group with, and without BEN, respectively. BEN is more prevalent in Black South Africans compared to US Non-Hispanic Whites. Our data do not support excluding populations from HIV vaccine trials because of BEN. BEN was not associated with increased risk for HIV infection or Adverse events on a vaccine trial. Predictors of HIV infection risk were females and cannabis use, underlying the continued importance of prevention programmes in focusing on these populations."

Among a group of Hong Kong Chinese children diagnosed with developmental dyslexia, we investigated the relationship between Chinese word reading and perceptual expertise with Chinese characters. In a perceptual fluency task, the time of visual exposure to Chinese characters was manipulated and limited such that the speed of discrimination of a short sequence of Chinese characters at an accuracy level of 80% was estimated. Pair-wise correlations showed that perceptual fluency for characters predicted speeded and non-speeded word reading performance. Exploratory hierarchical regressions showed that perceptual fluency for characters accounted for 5.3% and 9.6% variance in speeded and non-speeded reading respectively, in addition to age, non-verbal IQ, phonological awareness, morphological awareness, rapid automatized naming (RAN) and perceptual fluency for digits. The findings suggest that perceptual expertise with words plays an important role in Chinese reading performance in developmental dyslexia, and that perceptual training is a potential remediation direction."

https://openalex.org/W3122030906,"Masatoshi Koshiba, eminent experimental particle physicist, passed away on 12 November 2020. He was 94. By conducting electron–positron (e−–e+) collider experiments, Koshiba used his creativity to advance the field of particle physics. He also adapted equipment to make ground-shifting discoveries, leading to the new fields of underground neutrino physics and neutrino astronomy.

Koshiba was born in Toyohashi, Japan, on 19 September 1926. He earned his B.S. in physics from the University of Tokyo in 1951 and completed his master's thesis detecting cosmic rays with a nuclear emulsions technique. In 1953, he enrolled in the Graduate School of Physics at Rochester University in New York. After obtaining his Ph.D. in cosmic ray physics within 2 years, he was appointed as a research fellow at the University of Chicago in 1955. In 1958, he returned to the University of Tokyo, where he remained until his retirement in 1987.

After contributing to international cosmic ray collaborations, Koshiba began his exploration of accelerator particle physics in 1969, when he joined the construction of the e−–e+ collider at Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics in Russia. Although the project was terminated in 1972, Koshiba pushed on with e−–e+ collider experiments and later joined the Double Arm Spectrometer (DASP) experiment at Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY) in Germany. This project evolved into the JADE (Japan, Deutschland, and England) experiment at DESY. Through these experiments, Koshiba established the Standard Model of particle physics and discovered the gluon, which mediates strong interactions between quarks. In 1985, in recognition of these efforts, he received the Great Cross of Merit, the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany. Koshiba dreamed of constructing the next-generation e−–e+ linear collider in Japan, a vision that will be realized with the completion of the e−–e+ International Linear Collider (ILC).

In 1980, detecting evidence of a so-called Grand Unified Theory became a major challenge for experimentalists. This theory predicted that protons would decay, and Koshiba proposed a way to detect the process. We both joined Koshiba as he prepared to execute his experiment, known as the Kamioka Nucleon Decay Experiment (Kamiokande). He had constructed a 3000-ton water Cherenkov detector located 1000 m underground in the Kamioka mine. The distinguishing feature of this experiment was the use of 1000 photomultiplier tubes with a diameter of 51 cm, the largest in the world. Kamiokande started to collect data in 1983. Unfortunately, the lifetime of a proton was found to be much longer than the sensitivity of Kamiokande, and we could not find any positive signals. However, Koshiba—with characteristic ingenuity—noticed that the Kamiokande detector was sensitive to astrophysical neutrinos, including solar neutrinos (generated inside the Sun). He proposed an update to the detector to observe neutrinos instead.



The results of the first solar neutrino observation experiment, led by physicist Raymond Davis Jr. in 1968, had shown a deficit of neutrinos relative to the solar model prediction. Within 2 months of the start of Kamiokande's solar neutrino data collection in 1987, billions of extragalactic messengers—the supernova (SN) 1987A neutrinos —swept through Earth. SN 1987A occurred in the Large Magellanic Cloud, 170,000 light-years away from the Solar System. On 23 February 1987, 11 neutrino events were observed in Kamiokande within 13 seconds. The energies and number of observed events in the Kamiokande data showed that the origin of a supernova was gravitational collapse and that 99% of the released gravitational energy is carried out by neutrinos, which confirmed the basic idea of the star core collapse. Davis and Koshiba shared the 2002 Nobel Prize in Physics “for pioneering contributions to astrophysics, in particular for the detection of cosmic neutrinos,” and the research field of neutrino astronomy was born.

Kamiokande succeeded in observing solar neutrinos, and the data—collected through 1990—clearly confirmed the solar neutrino deficit, the explanation for which remained a puzzle. In addition to the solar neutrino deficit, Kamiokande first observed the atmospheric neutrino anomaly that shows a deficit of muon neutrino to electron neutrino ratio of atmospheric neutrinos. Both the solar neutrino deficit and the atmospheric neutrino anomaly were predicted to be solved by neutrino oscillations induced by finite neutrino masses that had been predicted by the Grand Unified Theory. These anomalies were finally resolved in 1998 by the detection of evidence of neutrino oscillations in Super-Kamiokande, a 50,000-ton water Cherenkov detector originally proposed by Koshiba. For this work, physicist Takaaki Kajita, one of Koshiba's Ph.D. students, was awarded the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physics.

Koshiba nurtured many talented physicists and educated them using his signature didactic messages. For example, Koshiba suggested that a researcher should always hold three or four new “eggs” (research ideas) at a time but should regularly ask whether each egg can still become a bird. If not, then the idea is no longer worth holding. He also recommended that experimental equipment incorporate as many distinctive devices as possible. That way, even if you fail to catch the prey you are aiming for, you will have a chance to catch other prey.

Koshiba's incredible enthusiasm and outstanding ability to get things done were embodied by Kamiokande, which led to both neutrino astronomy and the discovery of finite neutrino masses. Koshiba always worked on his research with keen intuition, passion, foresight, and leadership. His innovative ideas inspired younger researchers, who built on his work to realize his dreams. Those young scientists will no doubt continue to advance the field of physics on the basis of the foundations that Koshiba put in place."
