https://openalex.org/W2078719918,"Studies of the identity and physiological function of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have been hampered by a lack of markers that permit both prospective identification and fate mapping in vivo. We found that Leptin Receptor (LepR) is a marker that highly enriches bone marrow MSCs. Approximately 0.3% of bone marrow cells were LepR+, 10% of which were CFU-Fs, accounting for 94% of bone marrow CFU-Fs. LepR+ cells formed bone, cartilage, and adipocytes in culture and upon transplantation in vivo. LepR+ cells were Scf-GFP+, Cxcl12-DsRedhigh, and Nestin-GFPlow, markers which also highly enriched CFU-Fs, but negative for Nestin-CreER and NG2-CreER, markers which were unlikely to be found in CFU-Fs. Fate-mapping showed that LepR+ cells arose postnatally and gave rise to most bone and adipocytes formed in adult bone marrow, including bone regenerated after irradiation or fracture. LepR+ cells were quiescent, but they proliferated after injury. Therefore, LepR+ cells are the major source of bone and adipocytes in adult bone marrow."
https://openalex.org/W1964224776,"The availability of complete human genome sequences from populations across the world has given rise to new population genetic inference methods that explicitly model ancestral relationships under recombination and mutation. So far, application of these methods to evolutionary history more recent than 20,000-30,000 years ago and to population separations has been limited. Here we present a new method that overcomes these shortcomings. The multiple sequentially Markovian coalescent (MSMC) analyzes the observed pattern of mutations in multiple individuals, focusing on the first coalescence between any two individuals. Results from applying MSMC to genome sequences from nine populations across the world suggest that the genetic separation of non-African ancestors from African Yoruban ancestors started long before 50,000 years ago and give information about human population history as recent as 2,000 years ago, including the bottleneck in the peopling of the Americas and separations within Africa, East Asia and Europe."

To identify genes that can functionally substitute for oncogenic RAS, we systematically expressed 15,294 open reading frames in a human KRAS-dependent colon cancer cell line engineered to express an inducible KRAS-specific shRNA. We found 147 genes that promoted survival upon KRAS suppression. In particular, the transcriptional coactivator YAP1 rescued cell viability in KRAS-dependent cells upon suppression of KRAS and was required for KRAS-induced cell transformation. Acquired resistance to Kras suppression in a Kras-driven murine lung cancer model also involved increased YAP1 signaling. KRAS and YAP1 converge on the transcription factor FOS and activate a transcriptional program involved in regulating the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Together, these findings implicate transcriptional regulation of EMT by YAP1 as a significant component of oncogenic RAS signaling.

Together, these findings implicate transcriptional regulation of EMT by YAP1 as a significant component of oncogenic RAS signaling. Mutation of proto-oncogenes, such as KRAS, BRAF, and EGFR, induces a state in which cancers are dependent on signaling from the oncogene for survival (Sharma and Settleman, 2007Sharma S.V. Settleman J. Oncogene addiction: setting the stage for molecularly targeted cancer therapy.Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 3214-3231Google Scholar). Although the mechanisms that lead to this oncogene addiction remain poorly understood, pharmacologic inhibition of such oncogenes results in clinical responses. Furthermore, tumors that are resistant to these therapeutic interventions often exhibit reactivation of the signaling pathways regulated by these oncogenes. For example, EGFR-addicted cancers that relapse have been found to harbor MET copy-number amplification or KRAS mutation, which mediate resistance by activating the same downstream effector pathways independent of EGFR (Jänne et al., 2009Jänne P.A. Gray N. Settleman J. Factors underlying sensitivity of cancers to small-molecule kinase inhibitors.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2009; 8: 709-723Google Scholar). Activating mutations of the KRAS proto-oncogene occur in a substantial fraction of pancreatic, lung, and colon cancers (Lau and Haigis, 2009Lau K.S. Haigis K.M. Non-redundancy within the RAS oncogene family: insights into mutational disparities in cancer.Mol. Cells. 2009; 28: 315-320Google Scholar). Oncogenic KRAS activates pleiotropic signaling pathways that contribute to tumor initiation and maintenance, including the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and Ral guanine nucleotide exchange factor (RalGEF) signaling pathways (Pylayeva-Gupta et al., 2011Pylayeva-Gupta Y. Grabocka E. Bar-Sagi D. RAS oncogenes: weaving a tumorigenic web.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2011; 11: 761-774Google Scholar). Suppression or inhibition of these pathways prevents tumor initiation and slows the growth of established tumors (Ehrenreiter et al., 2009Ehrenreiter K. Kern F. Velamoor V. Meissl K. Galabova-Kovacs G. Sibilia M. Baccarini M. Raf-1 addiction in Ras-induced skin carcinogenesis.Cancer Cell. 2009; 16: 149-160Google Scholar, González-García et al., 2005González-García A.

One consequence of mutant KRAS signaling is aberrant activation of the AP-1 family transcription factors, which promote responses to mitogenic signaling (Karin, 1995Karin M. The regulation of AP-1 activity by mitogen-activated protein kinases.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Scopus (2157) Google Scholar). Specifically, KRAS increases FOS and JUN activation through MAPK-dependent and -independent mechanisms (Deng and Karin, 1994Deng T. Karin M. c-Fos transcriptional activity stimulated by H-Ras-activated protein kinase distinct from JNK and ERK.Nature. 1994; 371: 171-175Google Scholar). YAP1 is a transcriptional coactivator that participates in several context-dependent transcriptional programs that regulate organ size and promote cell proliferation (Wang et al., 2009Wang K. Degerny C. Xu M. Yang X.-J. YAP, TAZ, and Yorkie: a conserved family of signal-responsive transcriptional coregulators in animal development and human disease.Biochem. Cell Biol. 2009; 87: 77-91Google Scholar). Recurrent YAP1 amplifications are observed in hepatocellular cancers, in which it is an essential oncogene (Zender et al., 2006Zender L. Spector M.S. Xue W. Flemming P. Cordon-Cardo C. Silke J. Fan S.-T. Luk J.M. Wigler M. Hannon G.J. et al.Identification and validation of oncogenes in liver cancer using an integrative oncogenomic approach.Cell. 2006; 125: 1253-1267Google Scholar). In addition, YAP1 is also implicated in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the metastatic potential of mammary epithelial cells (Lamar et al., 2012Lamar J.M. Stern P. Liu H. Schindler J.W. Jiang Z.-G. Hynes R.O. The Hippo pathway target, YAP, promotes metastasis through its TEAD-interaction domain.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: E2441-E2450Google Scholar, Overholtzer et al., 2006Overholtzer M. Zhang J. Smolen G.A. Muir B. Li W. Sgroi D.C. Deng C.-X. Brugge J.S. Haber D.A. Transforming properties of YAP, a candidate oncogene on the chromosome 11q22 amplicon.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 12405-12410Google Scholar). YAP1 serves as an effector of the Hippo (Hpo) kinase cascade and regulates the transcriptional enhancer activator domain (TEAD) transcription factors (Pan, 2010Pan D. The hippo signaling pathway in development and cancer.Dev. Cell. 2010; 19: 491-505Google Scholar). Serine phosphorylation of YAP1 by both Hpo-dependent and -independent factors inhibits YAP1 entry into the nucleus, preventing subsequent activation of not only TEAD but of other YAP1 transcriptional partners such as SMAD, RUNX, TBX5, and the ERBB4 internal cytoplasmic fragment (Wang et al., 2009Wang K. Degerny C. Xu M. Yang X.-J. YAP, TAZ, and Yorkie: a conserved family of signal-responsive transcriptional coregulators in animal development and human disease.Biochem. Cell Biol. 2009; 87: 77-91Google Scholar). One Hpo-independent mechanism implicated in cancer involves phosphorylation of YAP1 at tyrosine-357 by YES1 to promote YAP1 interaction with β-catenin and modulation of Wnt signaling (Rosenbluh et al., 2012Rosenbluh J. Nijhawan D. Cox A.G. Li X. Neal J.T. Schafer E.J. Zack T.I. Wang X. Tsherniak A. Schinzel A.C. et al.β-Catenin-driven cancers require a YAP1 transcriptional complex for survival and tumorigenesis.Cell. 2012; 151: 1457-1473Google Scholar). These observations suggest that YAP1 interacts with specific transcription factors in particular contexts to promote cell proliferation, organ growth, or survival. Identification of genes that promote resistance to targeted therapies can provide insight into signaling mechanisms activated by particular oncogenes. Here, we applied a similar concept to systematically probe pathways required for cancer cell lines that harbor and are dependent on oncogenic KRAS. Specifically, we performed a genetic screen to identify open reading frames (ORFs) that are able to sustain the survival of KRAS-dependent cancer cell lines in the setting of KRAS suppression. We performed a genome-scale genetic rescue screen to identify genes that support the survival of KRAS-dependent cancer cells upon suppression of KRAS. We generated a cell line for screening by stably introducing a doxycycline-inducible shRNA targeting the KRAS 3′ untranslated region (UTR) into the HCT116 KRAS mutant colon cancer cell line (HCTtetK) and introduced 15,294 ORFs from the Center for Cancer Systems Biology (CCSB)/Broad Institute ORF library (Yang et al., 2011Yang X. Boehm J.S. Yang X. Salehi-Ashtiani K. Hao T. Shen Y. Lubonja R. Thomas S.R. Alkan O. Bhimdi T. et al.A public genome-scale lentiviral expression library of human ORFs.Nat. Methods. 2011; 8: 659-661Google Scholar) into these cells in an arrayed format in triplicate under optimized conditions in which each well was transduced at high efficiency (98%, Table S1 available online). We induced suppression of KRAS by doxycycline treatment and assessed cell proliferation/survival (Figure 1A). As a control, we expressed a mutant KRASG13D ORF, which lacks the KRAS 3′UTR and thus cannot be suppressed (Figure 1B). We considered an ORF a “hit” if it obtained a KRAS rescue score greater than 3, i.e., the viability in that well was at least three standard deviations above the mean of negative controls. All of the 150 KRASG13D-expressing wells scored above this threshold, and only 1 of the 1,119 negative control wells (0.05%) scored. We identified 147 genes that met this criterion (Table S1). The highest-scoring candidates included sterile α motif (SAM) proteins that function as posttranscriptional regulators (Baez and Boccaccio, 2005Baez M.V. Boccaccio G.L. Mammalian Smaug is a translational repressor that forms cytoplasmic foci similar to stress granules.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 43131-43140Google Scholar), the WW-domain-binding proteins YAP1 and WWTR1, and members of the FGF family (Figure 1C). In a separate screen focused on 597 kinases (CCSB/Broad Kinase ORF Collection), we also identified FGFR1 as a kinase that was able to rescue KRAS suppression (Figure S1A). We then assessed the ability of each ORF to activate MAPK or PI3K signaling. Specifically, we expressed the 147 ORFs in HCTtetK cells in an arrayed format and quantified the activity of the MAPK and PI3K pathways by measuring the ratio of phospho-ERK to total-ERK levels and the ratio of phospho-S6 ribosomal protein to total S6 ribosomal protein levels, respectively (Figure 1D and Table S2). We found that 55.1% of the candidates activated at least one of the two pathways (16.1% MAPK only, 13.4% PI3K only, and 25.6% both pathways). A number of candidate genes failed to activate either pathway, suggesting that MEK- and PI3K-independent mechanisms may also play a role in KRAS-dependent tumors. The observation that a large proportion of these candidates indeed activated KRAS effector pathways increased our confidence in the biological relevance of the rescue screen. We focused on understanding YAP1, the highest-scoring gene in the screen. Expression of YAP1-2γ (hereafter referred to as YAP1) (Sudol, 2012Sudol M. YAP1 oncogene and its eight isoforms.Oncogene. 2012; 32: 3922Google Scholar) in HCTtetK cells prevented the morphological changes observed after suppression of KRAS (Figure 2A) and rescued the loss of viability induced by suppressing KRAS (Figure 2B). To ensure that the effects were not HCT116 specific, we tested the ability of YAP1 to complement loss of KRAS function in four additional KRAS mutant colon and pancreatic cancer cell lines (SW480, LS513, SU86.86, AsPC-1). We found that wild-type YAP1 rescued LS513, SU86.86, and AsPC-1 cell lines from KRAS suppression and that a constitutively active version of YAP1, which lacks five serine phosphorylation sites (YAP15SA) (Zhao et al., 2007Zhao B. Wei X. Li W. Udan R.S. Yang Q. Kim J. Xie J. Ikenoue T. Yu J. Li L. et al.Inactivation of YAP oncoprotein by the Hippo pathway is involved in cell contact inhibition and tissue growth control.Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 2747-2761Google Scholar), rescued loss of viability in SW480 cells (Figure 2C). We concluded that YAP1 signaling functionally replaces KRAS in KRAS-dependent cancer cells, although YAP1 itself may be differentially regulated in specific cell lines. In consonance with these findings, tumors that escape suppression of Kras in Kras-driven murine pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas exhibit Yap1 amplifications (Kapoor et al., 2014Kapoor A. Yao W. Ying H. Hua S. Liewen A. Wang Q. Zhong Y. Wu C.-J. Sadanandam A. Hu B. et al.Yap1 activation enables bypass of oncogenic Kras addiction in pancreatic cancer.Cell. 2014; 157 (this issue): 185-197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (452) Google Scholar [this issue of Cell]). To assess the specificity of the YAP1 phenotype to KRAS suppression, we tested whether YAP1 expression rescued suppression of additional oncogenes, c-MYC and PIK3CA, which are also activated in HCT116 cells. Suppression of c-MYC using two c-MYC-specific shRNAs reduced cell viability. Expression of c-MYC, but not YAP1, rescued this phenotype (Figure 2D). Furthermore, exposure to the PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941 arrested proliferation, and this effect was not rescued by YAP1 expression (Figure S2A). Together, these observations support the conclusion that rescue of KRAS suppression by YAP1 was not due to a general effect on survival by YAP1. To interrogate the functional relationship between KRAS and YAP1 further, we assessed whether YAP1 is required for KRAS-induced cell transformation. We expressed KRASG13D or YAP1 cDNAs in immortalized HA1E cells (Hahn et al., 1999Hahn W.C. Counter C.M. Lundberg A.S. Beijersbergen R.L. Brooks M.W. Weinberg R.A. Creation of human tumour cells with defined genetic elements.Nature. 1999; 400: 464-468Google Scholar) and confirmed that either KRASG13D or YAP1 induced anchorage-independent colony formation when a control shRNA was expressed. We found that expression of two YAP1-specific shRNAs abrogated KRAS-driven anchorage-independent colony formation (Figures 2E and S2B). Expression of shYAP1-2 targets the YAP1 3′UTR and, as expected, failed to suppress YAP1-driven anchorage-independent colony formation. We next examined the effect of manipulation of KRAS on the regulation of YAP1. Manipulating KRAS expression did not affect phosphorylation of YAP1 serine-127, a site implicated in regulation of YAP1 by Hpo signaling (Zhao et al., 2007Zhao B. Wei X. Li W. Udan R.S. Yang Q. Kim J. Xie J. Ikenoue T. Yu J. Li L. et al.Inactivation of YAP oncoprotein by the Hippo pathway is involved in cell contact inhibition and tissue growth control.Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 2747-2761Google Scholar), nor phosphorylation of components of the Hpo cascade such as LATS-1/2 and MST2 (Figure S2C). We concluded that KRAS does not alter YAP1 phosphorylation or activation. In HCTtetK cells expressing the negative control LacZ, treatment with doxycycline for 2 days to induce KRAS suppression led to decreased levels of phosphorylated ERK, AKT, and S6. We found that YAP1 expression restored AKT and S6 phosphorylation to baseline levels and increased ERK phosphorylation (Figure 2F). These observations are in consonance with prior reports (Zhang et al., 2009Zhang J. Ji J.-Y. Yu M. Overholtzer M. Smolen G.A. Wang R. Brugge J.S. Dyson N.J. Haber D.A. YAP-dependent induction of amphiregulin identifies a non-cell-autonomous component of the Hippo pathway.Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 1444-1450Google Scholar, Overholtzer et al., 2006Overholtzer M. Zhang J. Smolen G.A. Muir B. Li W. Sgroi D.C. Deng C.-X. Brugge J.S. Haber D.A. Transforming properties of YAP, a candidate oncogene on the chromosome 11q22 amplicon.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 12405-12410Google Scholar) that showed that YAP1-regulated expression of the EGFR ligand amphiregulin led to activation of ERK and AKT. However, expression of ERK, MEK, or AKT failed to rescue HCTtetK cells upon suppression of KRAS in our original screen (Table S1), and YAP1 expression had no measureable effect on the activation of KRAS, as assessed by GTP-bound KRAS levels after pull-down with the Ras-binding domain of RAF1 (Figure S2D). To determine whether reactivation of MAPK and PI3K signaling was necessary for the ability of YAP1 to rescue KRAS suppression, we treated HCTtetK cells expressing YAP1 with the PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941 or the MEK inhibitor AZD-6244 (Figures 2G and S2E). We found that YAP1 rescued HCTtetK cells from KRAS suppression to the level that we observed previously when treated with the vehicle (DMSO, Figure 2B). Treatment with either MEK or PI3K inhibitor decreased but failed to fully suppress the ability of YAP1 to rescue KRAS inhibition as compared to cells expressing LacZ (Figure 2G). Furthermore, combined treatment with both inhibitors did not further decrease viability. Thus although YAP1 partially restores the activity of PI3K and MEK pathways after KRAS suppression, activation of these pathways fails to fully account for the ability of YAP1 to promote survival in KRAS-dependent cells after KRAS suppression. YAP1 is regulated by multiple signaling pathways and regulates the function of several transcription factors. YAP1 is composed of a TEAD-binding domain, an SH3-binding motif, two WW domains, and a transcription activation domain (Figure 3A), and YAP1 nuclear localization is mediated by a C-terminal PDZ domain-binding motif (Oka and Sudol, 2009Oka T. Sudol M. Nuclear localization and pro-apoptotic signaling of YAP2 require intact PDZ-binding motif.Genes Cells. 2009; 14: 607-615Google Scholar). To identify regions of YAP1 necessary to promote survival after KRAS suppression, we expressed previously described YAP1 domain-specific mutants in HCTtetK cells to assess their effect on YAP1 function (Figure 3A). First, we explored the role of TEAD transcription factors for the KRAS-related functions of YAP1. Prior work identified YAP1 TEAD-binding domain mutants that disrupt binding to TEAD transcription factors (YAP1S94A and YAP1Δ60–89) (Zhao et al., 2008bZhao B. Ye X. Yu J. Li L. Li W. Li S. Yu J. Lin J.D. Wang C.-Y. Chinnaiyan A.M. et al.TEAD mediates YAP-dependent gene induction and growth control.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 1962-1971Google Scholar, Cao et al., 2008Cao X. Pfaff S.L. Gage F.H. YAP regulates neural progenitor cell number via the TEA domain transcription factor.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 3320-3334Google Scholar). Expression of these mutants indeed abolished the ability of YAP1 to activate a TEAD-specific reporter (Figure 3B) (Ota and Sasaki, 2008Ota M. Sasaki H. Mammalian Tead proteins regulate cell proliferation and contact inhibition as transcriptional mediators of Hippo signaling.Development. 2008; 135: 4059-4069Google Scholar). However, these YAP1 mutants rescued the proliferation effects of KRAS suppression similar to wild-type YAP1 (YAPWT; Figure 3C), suggesting that TEAD-specific effects are dispensable for YAP1 rescue. These findings differ from those of Kapoor et al., 2014Kapoor A. Yao W. Ying H. Hua S. Liewen A. Wang Q. Zhong Y. Wu C.-J. Sadanandam A. Hu B. et al.Yap1 activation enables bypass of oncogenic Kras addiction in pancreatic cancer.Cell. 2014; 157 (this issue): 185-197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (452) Google Scholar, who identified TEAD2 as one mediator of YAP1 function by showing that a constitutively active fusion of the VP16 domain to the DNA-binding region of TEAD2 (TEAD2-VP16) (Cao et al., 2008Cao X. Pfaff S.L. Gage F.H. YAP regulates neural progenitor cell number via the TEA domain transcription factor.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 3320-3334Google Scholar) was able to rescue KRAS suppression. We tested the ability of this construct to rescue in the HCTtetK model and found that TEAD2-VP16 activated a TEAD-specific reporter (Figure S3A) but failed to rescue the effect of KRAS suppression (Figures 3D and S3B). TEAD2-VP16 expression slowed the proliferation of HCTtetK cells (Figure 3D) and resulted in a change in cell morphology different than what we observed upon expression of YAP1 or expression of KRAS. Together, these results suggest that the TEAD family is not the primary mediator of the ability of YAP1 to complement loss of KRAS in this model system. Because we recently reported a role for YES1 phosphorylation of YAP1 for β-catenin signaling (Rosenbluh et al., 2012Rosenbluh J. Nijhawan D. Cox A.G. Li X. Neal J.T. Schafer E.J. Zack T.I. Wang X. Tsherniak A. Schinzel A.C. et al.β-Catenin-driven cancers require a YAP1 transcriptional complex for survival and tumorigenesis.Cell. 2012; 151: 1457-1473Google Scholar), we investigated whether YES1 played a role in KRAS signaling. We expressed two YAP1 mutants: YAP1ΔSH3bm, which disrupts the interaction of YES1 with YAP1 (Vassilev et al., 2001Vassilev A. Kaneko K.J. Shu H. Zhao Y. DePamphilis M.L. TEAD/TEF transcription factors utilize the activation domain of YAP65, a Src/Yes-associated protein localized in the cytoplasm.Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1229-1241Google Scholar, Sudol, 1994Sudol M. Yes-associated protein (YAP65) is a proline-rich phosphoprotein that binds to the SH3 domain of the Yes proto-oncogene product.Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2145-2152Google Scholar), and YAPY357F, which prevents YES1 phosphorylation of YAP1 (Rosenbluh et al., 2012Rosenbluh J. Nijhawan D. Cox A.G. Li X. Neal J.T. Schafer E.J. Zack T.I. Wang X. Tsherniak A. Schinzel A.C. et al.β-Catenin-driven cancers require a YAP1 transcriptional complex for survival and tumorigenesis.Cell. 2012; 151: 1457-1473Google Scholar). Expression of either YAP1ΔSH3bm or YAP1Y357F rescued the loss of cell viability observed after KRAS suppression to the level of YAP1WT (Figures S3C and S3D). Thus, YES1 modulation of β-catenin signaling also does not contribute to YAP1 activity in the context of KRAS suppression. We then tested whether YAP1-induced transcriptional activation was required to rescue KRAS suppression. Expression of YAP1 mutants that harbor a deletion of the transcriptional activation domain (YAPΔTA; Zhang et al., 2012Zhang X. Grusche F.A. Harvey K.F. Control of tissue growth and cell transformation by the Salvador/Warts/Hippo pathway.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e31994Google Scholar) disrupted the ability of YAP1 to rescue cells from KRAS suppression in HCTtetK cells, as did expression of YAP1 mutants that harbored a deletion of the 5 amino acid PDZ domain-binding motif (YAPΔPDZbm), reported to disrupt YAP1 nuclear localization (Figures 3E and S3E). These two YAP1 mutants also prevented YAP1-induced anchorage-independent growth (Figure S3F). These observations show that YAP1 mediates survival after suppression of KRAS through interactions with transcription factors in the nucleus. Because transcriptional activation was important for the ability of YAP1 to rescue KRAS suppression, we analyzed transcriptional profiles in HCTtetK cells in which we manipulated KRAS or YAP1 expression. We first identified genes that were downregulated after 30 hr of doxycycline (KRAS suppressed) treatment compared to untreated cells. Of those, we identified genes whose expression was rescued by the expression of both YAP1 and KRAS (Figure 4A and Table S3). Separately, we analyzed the transcriptional profiles of cells expressing the YAP1 TEAD-binding defective mutant YAP1S94A, compared to KRASG13D and YAP1WT as positive controls or to LACZ and YAP1ΔTA as negative controls. We noted that the expression signature induced by YAP1S94A overlapped but was distinct from that of YAP1WT, suggesting differences in specific transcriptional programs regulated by these alleles. Yet we found that YAP1S94A rescued expression of genes that decreased upon KRAS suppression (Figure S4A), as expected.Figure S4Identification and Functional Assessment of Transcriptional Motifs Enriched in KRAS- and YAP1-Regulated Genes, Related to Figure 4Show full caption(A) Gene expression in HCTtetK cells expressing indicated ORFs upon doxycycline treatment (shKRAS induction) for 48 hr compared to media alone.

Specifically, this category includes gene families such as activating transcription factor (ATF), early growth response protein (EGR), and specificity protein (SP) (Figure S4B).

Genome sequencing studies have shown that human malignancies often bear mutations in four or more driver genes1, but it is difficult to recapitulate this degree of genetic complexity in mouse models using conventional breeding. Here we use the CRISPR-Cas9 system of genome editing2,3,4 to overcome this limitation. By delivering combinations of small guide RNAs (sgRNAs) and Cas9 with a lentiviral vector, we modified up to five genes in a single mouse hematopoietic stem cell (HSC), leading to clonal outgrowth and myeloid malignancy. We thereby generated models of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with cooperating mutations in genes encoding epigenetic modifiers, transcription factors and mediators of cytokine signaling, recapitulating the combinations of mutations observed in patients. Our results suggest that lentivirus-delivered sgRNA:Cas9 genome editing should be useful to engineer a broad array of in vivo cancer models that better reflect the complexity of human disease."

Here we present a methodology enabling integration of information about TCR specificity with information about T cell function. This method involves sequencing of TCRα and TCRβ genes, and amplifying functional genes characteristic of different T cell subsets, in single T cells. Because this approach retains information about individual TCRα-TCRβ pairs, TCRs of interest can be expressed and used in functional studies, for antigen discovery, or in therapeutic applications.

The gradual progression from premalignant Barrett's esophagus to esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) provides an ideal model to study the ordering of somatic mutations. We identified recurrently mutated genes and assessed clonal structure using whole-genome sequencing and amplicon resequencing of 112 EACs. We next screened a cohort of 109 biopsies from 2 key transition points in the development of malignancy: benign metaplastic never-dysplastic Barrett's esophagus (NDBE; n=66) and high-grade dysplasia (HGD; n=43). Unexpectedly, the majority of recurrently mutated genes in EAC were also mutated in NDBE. Only TP53 and SMAD4 mutations occurred in a stage-specific manner, confined to HGD and EAC, respectively. Finally, we applied this knowledge to identify high-risk Barrett's esophagus in a new non-endoscopic test. In conclusion, mutations in EAC driver genes generally occur exceptionally early in disease development with profound implications for diagnostic and therapeutic strategies."

Intriguingly, miR135a levels were upregulated after administration of antidepressants. Genetically modified mouse models, expressing higher or lower levels of miR135, demonstrated major alterations in anxiety- and depression-like behaviors, 5HT levels, and behavioral response to antidepressant treatment. Finally, miR135a levels in blood and brain of depressed human patients were significantly lower.

Here, we show in mouse and human airway basal stem cells (ABSCs) that intracellular flux from low to moderate ROS levels is required for stem cell self-renewal and proliferation. Changing ROS levels activate Nrf2, which activates the Notch pathway to stimulate ABSC self-renewal and an antioxidant program that scavenges intracellular ROS, returning overall ROS levels to a low state to maintain homeostatic balance.

Extensive research during the past decades has focused on elucidating the roles of cytokines and the microenvironment in the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). However, it is only in the past few years that nutrient resources and their transport have emerged as key regulators of HSC survival and proliferation. Increasing glucose metabolism, through the de novo synthesis and/or translocation of glucose transporters to the cell surface, is thought to be crucial for the activation and cell cycle entry of hematopoietic progenitors. HSCs reside in a hypoxic environment and several recent studies have elegantly shown that this environment, conducive to high rates of glycolysis, is required for stem cell maintenance (Majeti et al., 2007Majeti R.

Metabolic regulation by the mitochondrial phosphatase PTPMT1 is required for hematopoietic stem cell differentiation.Cell Stem Cell. 2013; 12: 62-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Indeed, HSCs have a low mitochondrial mass and mutations in genes such as PTEN-like mitochondrial phosphatase that enhance glycolysis and lower oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) (Yu et al., 2013Yu W.M. Liu X. Shen J. Jovanovic O. Pohl E.E. Gerson S.L. Finkel T. Broxmeyer H.E. Qu C.K. Metabolic regulation by the mitochondrial phosphatase PTPMT1 is required for hematopoietic stem cell differentiation.Cell Stem Cell. 2013; 12: 62-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) increase HSC numbers and inhibit hematopoietic differentiation. Furthermore, elevated levels of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (Pdk), which increase glycolysis, augment stem cell potential, whereas loss of Pdk function attenuates glycolysis and HSC reconstitution capacity (Takubo et al., 2013Takubo K. Nagamatsu G. Kobayashi C.I. Nakamura-Ishizu A. Kobayashi H. Ikeda E. Goda N. Rahimi Y. Johnson R.S.

Thus, factors that modulate the balance between mitochondrial and nonmitochondrial metabolism control HSC function. HSC renewal is also regulated by the fuel type that is used by the cell. Recent work has shown that fatty acid oxidation (FAO) is required for optimal HSC maintenance. Activation of FAO results in an asymmetric division and self-renewal while its inhibition leads to a symmetric, differentiating division (Ito et al., 2012Ito K. Carracedo A. Weiss D. Arai F. Ala U. Avigan D.E. Schafer Z.T. Evans R.M. Suda T. Lee C.H. Pandolfi P.P. A PML–PPAR-δ pathway for fatty acid oxidation regulates hematopoietic stem cell maintenance.Nat. Med. 2012; 18: 1350-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Thus, different metabolic pathways such as glucose-driven glycolysis and FAO play key roles in HSC stemness and the decision of an HSC to undergo self-renewal as compared to differentiation. Nevertheless, it is not known whether metabolic pathways regulate the commitment of an HSC to a specific lineage fate. Cell differentiation is generally associated with proliferation and increased metabolic requirements that can be provided by energy sources such as glucose, fatty acids, lactate, or glutamine, among others (reviewed in Vander Heiden et al., 2009Vander Heiden M.G.

Glucose and glutamine metabolism are interrelated: glutamine transport is the rate-limiting step in the activation of mTOR, and mTOR upregulates the Glut1 glucose transporter and glucose transport (Fuchs et al., 2007Fuchs B.C.

While glucose and glutamine are both precursors in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, as well as precursors in the production of lipids, nucleotides, and amino acids, their relative contributions to metabolic pathways driving HSC lineage commitment remain undefined. The Glut1 glucose transporter is only upregulated during the final mitoses of HSC-driven erythroid differentiation (Montel-Hagen et al., 2008aMontel-Hagen A. Blanc L. Boyer-Clavel M. Jacquet C.

Taylor N. Erythroid glucose transporters.Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2009; 16: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Thus, other nutrients are likely to regulate HSC lineage commitment. Here, we demonstrate that the expression and function of the ASCT2 glutamine transporter (also known as SLC1A5) on HSCs is critical for erythroid lineage specification. Blocking glutamine metabolism completely abrogated the erythroid differentiation of human CD34+ progenitors and severely attenuated murine erythropoiesis under stress conditions and during the newborn period. Commitment to an erythroid fate was not restored by bypassing the glutamine-based fueling of the TCA cycle, but rather was strictly dependent on glutamine-supported de novo nucleotide biosynthesis. Moreover, erythroid commitment was associated with an increased shunting of glucose through the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), resulting in the synthesis of five-carbon sugars used for nucleotide biosynthesis. Treatment of erythropoietin-induced HSCs with the 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) analog further promoted shunting of glucose through this pathway, enhancing the magnitude and kinetics of HSC erythroid commitment. In contrast, under conditions of limiting nucleotide biosynthesis, HSCs were not able to undergo erythroid differentiation and were diverted to a myelomonocytic cell fate. Thus, our data point to the critical nature of metabolic pathways in regulating HSC lineage specification. Previous data showing that the Glut1 glucose transporter is not significantly expressed on hematopoietic progenitors and is only upregulated during late stages of human erythropoiesis suggested that alternative nutrient transporters may be implicated in HSC quiescence and lineage commitment (Montel-Hagen et al., 2008aMontel-Hagen A.

Indeed, we did not detect Glut1 on either CD34+CD38− HSCs or more differentiated CD34+CD38+ progenitors. However, the ASCT2 glutamine transporter was expressed at significant levels on both subsets (Figure 1A). Furthermore, ASCT2 levels were not markedly altered during recombinant erythropoietin (rEPO)-induced erythroid lineage commitment (Figure 1B). Surface expression correlated with transcript levels; rEPO-induced erythropoiesis resulted in 80- and 40-fold increases in Glycophorin A (GlyA) and Glut1 mRNAs, respectively, whereas Asct2 levels were modulated by only 2-fold (Figure S1A available online). In order to assess the specific effects of Glut1 and ASCT2 on the differentiation of progenitors toward an erythroid lineage fate, we pursued an shRNA-mediated knockdown approach. CD34+ progenitors were transduced at a more than 30% efficiency (Figure S1B), resulting in the specific downregulation of ASCT2 or Glut1 in shASCT2-GFP or shGlut1-GFP-transduced progenitors, respectively (Figures S1C and S1D; 90% and 60%, respectively). Notably, the EPO-induced lineage commitment of the most immature CD34+CD38−Lin− progenitors toward the erythroid lineage was severely attenuated by ASCT2 downregulation. Only 10% of shASCT2-transduced cells acquired expression of the GlyA marker following 6 days of differentiation as compared to 40%–80% of control or shGlut1-transduced HSCs (Figure 1C). Furthermore, ASCT2 knockdown resulted in a significant skewing of CD34+CD38− progenitors to the myeloid lineage, even in the presence of rEPO. Specifically, approximately 50% of shASCT2-transduced progenitors upregulated the CD11b myeloid marker as compared to only 5%–21% of cells in control-GFP and shGlut1-transduced subsets (Figure 1C). Altogether, these data point to the importance of ASCT2 in the erythroid commitment of primitive progenitors. The downregulation of ASCT2 was also associated with a massive selective disadvantage following rEPO stimulation; the percentages of GFP+ cells decreased by 50% between days 2 and 4 of differentiation and by 85% by day 7 (Figure 1D). Interestingly, progenitors in which Glut1 was downregulated were also negatively selected, but erythroid differentiation was not significantly compromised (Figures 1C and 1D). In the absence of rEPO, decreases in the percentages of shGlut1-GFP+ and shASCT2-GFP+ progenitors were only gradual, similar to that detected in control GFP-transduced cells (Figure 1D). These data suggest that the optimal expression of ASCT2 and Glut1 transporters is not required for progenitor cell expansion. However, the two transporters play critical and nonredundant roles in supporting the erythroid commitment of HSCs. While ASCT2 transports glutamine, it also transports other neutral amino acids (Kanai and Hediger, 2004Kanai Y. Hediger M.A. The glutamate/neutral amino acid transporter family SLC1: molecular, physiological and pharmacological aspects.Pflugers Arch. 2004; 447: 469-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). It was therefore important to assess whether the role of ASCT2 in the erythroid lineage commitment of CD34+ progenitors was due to its capacity to transport glutamine. To address this question, we blocked glutaminolysis with 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (DON), a mitochondrial glutaminase inhibitor that functions only when the enzyme is active (Curthoys and Watford, 1995Curthoys N.P. Watford M. Regulation of glutaminase activity and glutamine metabolism.Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1995; 15: 133-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Importantly, treatment of CD34+ progenitors with this glutaminase inhibitor completely abrogated erythroid lineage commitment, as shown by an absence of GlyA and CD36 in rEPO-stimulated cultures (Figure 2A). We also studied the status of these progenitors by assessing forward scatter and α4 integrin expression; reductions in these two parameters correspond to terminal erythroid differentiation (Hu et al., 2013Hu J. Liu J. Xue F. Halverson G. Reid M. Guo A. Chen L. Raza A. Galili N. Jaffray J. et al.Isolation and functional characterization of human erythroblasts at distinct stages: implications for understanding of normal and disordered erythropoiesis in vivo.Blood. 2013; 121: 3246-3253Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Under conditions where DON was used to block glutaminase activity, FSC and α4 integrin levels remained elevated during the entire period of rEPO induction (Figure 2B). Furthermore, while ASCT2 was not affected by either lineage differentiation or glutamine utilization, surface Glut1 expression, associated with late erythroid differentiation, was not induced in the presence of DON (Figure 2C). In accord with the ASCT2 knockdown experiments (Figure 1C), DON-treated CD34+ progenitors differentiated toward the myelomonocytic lineage even in the presence of rEPO. This was assessed by CD11b and CD13 expression, together with high forward scatters (FSCs) and side scatters (SSCs) (Figure 2D). Importantly, EPO-induced CD34+CD38− HSCs as well as more mature CD34+CD38+ progenitors were diverted to a myeloid cell fate in the presence of DON (Figure 2E). Furthermore, DON treatment also promoted myeloid cell differentiation during cytokine-driven expansion (Figure S2A). Thus, inhibiting glutamine metabolism reorients the lineage potential of primitive progenitors to a myeloid fate, even in the presence of high doses of rEPO. To determine whether glutamine metabolism is important at all stages of erythroid differentiation, we carried out experiments wherein DON was added in undifferentiated progenitors as compared to progenitors that had already initiated an erythroid lineage commitment. These data showed that glutaminolysis is critical during early erythroid commitment but is not required once lineage fate is underway (Figure S2B). Furthermore, the results of DON are reversible; following removal of DON, progenitors acquired expression of erythroid lineage markers (Figure S2B). These data indicate that glutamine catabolism is required at early stages of HSC commitment to the erythroid lineage. Given the critical role of glutamine in the erythroid commitment of HSCs, it was of interest to evaluate the importance of glucose utilization in this process. We therefore assessed whether blocking glucose catabolism with 2-DG alters the fate of EPO-induced HSCs. CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors were differentiated in the presence of the nonmetabolizable 2-DG analog, under conditions where extracellular glucose and glutamine concentrations were maintained. Although Glut1-downregulated cells were counter-selected upon EPO treatment (Figure 1D), erythroid differentiation was actually enhanced in the presence of 2-DG (Figure 3A). The vast majority of progenitors were already GlyA+ at day 3 of differentiation in the presence of 2-DG (73%) as compared to 36% following induction with rEPO alone. The augmented erythroid differentiation was also demonstrated by the more rapid reduction in FSCs and SSCs and the loss of α4 integrin (Figures 3B and 3C). Furthermore, 2-DG treatment resulted in increased GlyA, β-globin, and Glut1 mRNAs and protein (Figures 3D and 3E). While the erythroid-enhancing effect of 2-DG was maximal at 1 mM, it was also observed at a concentration of 0.2 mM (Figure 3F). Terminal erythroid differentiation could be detected on a visual level, as demonstrated by cell pellets with a darker red color (Figure 3G). Furthermore, stained cytospins revealed more extensive erythroblast differentiation and enucleation in the presence of 2-DG (12%–26% as compared to 4%–8% in independent experiments; Figure 3H). Interestingly though, the enhancing effect of 2-DG on erythroid commitment was not detected in the presence of DON (Figure S4). Thus, the effects of blocking glutaminolysis are dominant over glucose catabolism, at least in the context of erythroid lineage commitment. The presence of 2-DG did not negatively impact on the proliferation of erythroid progenitors except at the highest dose (2.5 mM). Interestingly, nonerythroid progenitors were significantly more sensitive to the effects of 2-DG than their erythroid counterparts were (Figure S3B). These data suggest that the differential effects of 2-DG reflect a switch in the metabolic program of hematopoietic progenitors engaged toward an erythroid cell fate. In order to determine how glucose and glutamine metabolism impact on the in vivo commitment of HSCs under stress conditions, we induced a hemolytic anemia in adult mice by phenylhydrazine (PHZ) injection under conditions where glycolysis or glutaminolysis was blocked with 2-DG and DON, respectively. PHZ-injected mice showed an important rebound erythropoiesis by day 5 and at this time point, hematocrits (Hcts) in control and 2-DG-treated anemic mice recovered to similar levels (Hct range of 25–35) whereas the Hcts in DON-treated mice were markedly reduced (9–10, Figure 4A). The response to anemia could also be discerned by the impressive splenomegaly in control and 2-DG-treated anemic mice, which was not detected in DON-treated animals. Rebound erythropoiesis corresponded to increased percentages of splenic Ter119+ erythroid progenitors (up to 85%–90%) as compared with DON-treated mice where no induction was detected (mean of 33%), and a similar trend was detected in the bone marrow (BM; Figure 4A). Notably, the effects of glutamine metabolism on the erythroid commitment of hematopoietic progenitors were specific to conditions of stress because DON treatment of nonanemic control mice did not alter the percentages of Ter119+ cells in either BM or spleen (means of 54%–58% in BM and 42%–49% in spleen; Figure 4A). To further assess erythroid lineage differentiation, we evaluated Ter119+ cells on the basis of CD44/FSC staining (Chen et al., 2009Chen K. Liu J. Heck S. Chasis J.A. An X. Mohandas N. Resolving the distinct stages in erythroid differentiation based on dynamic changes in membrane protein expression during erythropoiesis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 17413-17418Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) with stages I and V representing the most undifferentiated and differentiated cells, respectively (Figure S5A). Following induction of anemia, the percentages of stage I–III progenitors were actually >10% higher in 2-DG-treated mice than in control anemic mice (mean of 70% compared to 60%, p < 0.05) with markedly lower levels in DON-treated mice (mean of 28%; Figure 4B). Thus, blocking glutamine metabolism inhibits the capacity of anemic mice to induce a rebound erythropoiesis. Notably, the drastic anemia in DON-treated mice was not due to a global effect on HSCs because the percentages of BM progenitors were similar in all groups (evaluated on the basis of a Lin−Sca1+c-Kit+ phenotype; 5%–8%; Figure 4C) and B and T lymphoid cells were not significantly affected (Figure S5B). Moreover, the presence of short-lived Gr1+ cells, requiring an ongoing HSC differentiation, was significantly higher in the BM and spleens of DON-treated anemic mice as compared to control and 2-DG-treated mice (Figures 4D and S5B; p < 0.001). Thus, these data are in complete accord with the increased ex vivo myeloid differentiation of human progenitors observed in the presence of DON. We next evaluated the in vivo effects of altering glucose and glutamine metabolism in newborn mice because during this stage of life, there is an active lineage commitment of HSCs with a high level of erythroid differentiation. Newborn mice were injected with either 2-DG or DON on postnatal days 3 and 5 and sacrificed on day 6. The percentages of splenic Ter119+ cells were equivalent in control and 2-DG-treated pups (means of 80% and 84%) but were significantly lower in DON-treated mice (57%; p < 0.0001; Figure 5A). Furthermore, while the vast majority of Ter119+ cells in control and 2-DG-treated pups were at early stages of erythropoiesis (>90%; mean of 94%), erythroid commitment in the presence of DON was attenuated (Figure 5B). Accordingly, postnatal erythropoiesis, distinguished from prenatal erythropoiesis by loss of the Glut1 transporter (Montel-Hagen et al., 2008aMontel-Hagen A. Blanc L. Boyer-Clavel M. Jacquet C. Vidal M. Sitbon M. Taylor N. The Glut1 and Glut4 glucose transporters are differentially expressed during perinatal and postnatal erythropoiesis.Blood. 2008; 112: 4729-4738Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, Montel-Hagen et al., 2008bMontel-Hagen A.

Thus, these data demonstrate that blocking glutamine metabolism, but not glucose metabolism, severely impedes the postnatal commitment of HSCs to an erythroid lineage fate. Glucose catabolism was however critical for myeloid lineage commitment during the immediate postnatal period. Treatment with the 2-DG glucose analog resulted in marked decreases in Gr1+ as well as CD11b+ cells, whereas in the presence of DON, Gr1+ cells were significantly increased (p < 0.001 for both conditions; Figure 5C). Thus, 2-DG and DON treatments have opposing effects on the myeloid lineage differentiation of HSCs in vivo. These data together with our ex vivo human progenitor differentiation experiments reveal a conservation in the metabolic constraints regulating the differentiation of human and murine HSCs to erythroid and myelomonocytic cell fates. To better elucidate the mechanism or mechanisms via which glutamine supports the erythroid lineage specification of HSCs, we evaluated the metabolic pathways fueled by glutamine. The role of glutamine in supporting the TCA cycle (anaplerosis) during erythropoiesis was evaluated by means of high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS). Glutamine, uniformly labeled with heavy carbon (13C) and nitrogen (15N) atoms, was traced intracellularly for 24 hr. The conversion of labeled glutamine into the TCA intermediate α-ketoglutarate (αKG) can be monitored by assessing the percentage of αKG incorporating 13C atoms. Importantly, we found that EPO-induced erythropoiesis resulted in a significant increase in glutamine-derived αKG, as shown by the relative abundance of the fully labeled isotopomer (13C5), in the absence or presence of 2-DG (Figure 6A). In contrast, and as expected, the anaplerotic contribution of glutamine was severely impaired in the presence of DON (Figure 6A). The generation of αKG from glutamine occurs via the deamination of glutamate, a reaction catalyzed by either glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) or transaminases (Figure 6B). We found that expression of GDH and the production of alanine, a byproduct of the transaminase-mediated generation of αKG, were increased during erythroid differentiation (Figures 6A and 6C). The latter result pointed to the importance of transaminases in the erythroid commitment of HSCs and indeed, the aminooxyacetic acid (AOA) pan transaminase inhibitor (Moreadith and Lehninger, 1984Moreadith R.W. Lehninger A.L. The pathways of glutamate and glutamine oxidation by tumor cell mitochondria. Role of mitochondrial NAD(P)+-dependent malic enzyme.J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6215-6221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) completely suppressed EPO-induced differentiation (Figure 6D). Notably, erythroid commitment was restored by supplementation with a cell-permeable ester (dimethyl α-ketoglutarate [DMK]; Figure 6D), indicating a critical role for transaminase-derived αKG in supporting erythropoiesis. On the basis of these data, we were surprised to find that EPO-induced erythropoiesis was sustained in the absence of extracellular glutamine (Figure 6E). However, glutamine can be synthesized intracellularly from glutamate, via glutamine synthetase (GS; Figure 6B). As such, we blocked this pathway using methionine sulfoximine (MSO), a GS inhibitor (Berlicki, 2008Berlicki L. Inhibitors of glutamine synthetase and their potential application in medicine.Mini Rev. Med. Chem. 2008; 8: 869-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and completely abrogated erythroid commitment (Figure 6E). These experiments reveal endogenous glutamine biosynthesis to be required for differentiation under conditions where extracellular glutamine is absent. Indeed, GS is highly expressed during erythropoiesis (data not shown). These findings demonstrate that glutamine itself, rather than its anaplerotic derivatives, is required for erythroid differentiation. In addition to its role in feeding the TCA cycle, glutamine directly feeds the de novo biosynthesis of nucleotides and indirectly contributes carbons and nitrogens to the biosynthesis of pyrimidines. The simultaneous tracing of glutamine carbons and nitrogens revealed that EPO significantly stimulated the de novo synthesis of purine and pyrimidine nucle"

Rivers receive AL from terrestrial habitats and represent a major source of AL to marine environments, but AL is rarely studied within freshwater ecosystems. Our objectives were to 1) quantify AL density in urban freshwaters, 2) compare AL abundance among freshwater, terrestrial, and marine ecosystems, and 3) characterize the activity and composition of AL biofilms in freshwater habitats. We quantified AL from the Chicago River and Chicago's Lake Michigan shoreline, and found that AL abundance in Chicago freshwater ecosystems was comparable to previously reported data for marine and terrestrial ecosystems, although AL density and composition differed among habitats. To assess microbial interactions with AL, we incubated AL and natural substrates in 3 freshwater ecosystems, quantified biofilm metabolism as gross primary production (GPP) and community respiration (CR), and characterized biofilm bacterial community composition via high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA genes. The main driver of biofilm community composition was incubation location (e.g., river vs pond), but there were some significant differences in biofilm composition and metabolism among substrates. For example, biofilms on organic substrates (cardboard and leaves) had lower GPP than hard substrates (glass, plastic, aluminum and tiles). In addition, bacterial communities on organic substrates were distinct in composition from those on hard substrates, with higher relative abundances of bacteria associated with cellulose decomposition. Finally, we used our results to develop a conceptual diagram designed to unite the study of AL in terrestrial and freshwater environments with the well-established field of marine debris research. We suggest this broad perspective will be useful for future studies which synthesize AL sources, ecosystem effects, and fate across multiple ecosystem types, and will benefit management and reduction of global AL accumulations."

In ovarian cancer (OC), spheroids serve as a vehicle for cancer cell dissemination in the peritoneal cavity, protecting cells from environmental stress-induced anoikis. To identify new targetable molecules in OC spheroids, we investigated gene expression profiles and networks upregulated in 3D vs traditional monolayer culture conditions. We identified ALDH1A1, a cancer stem cell marker as being overexpressed in OC spheroids and directly connected to key elements of the β-catenin pathway. β-Catenin function and ALDH1A1 expression were increased in OC spheroids vs monolayers and in successive spheroid generations, suggesting that 3D aggregates are enriched in cells with stem cell characteristics. β-Catenin knockdown decreased ALDH1A1 expression levels and β-catenin co-immunoprecipitated with the ALDH1A1 promoter, suggesting that ALDH1A1 is a direct β-catenin target. Both short interfering RNA-mediated β-catenin knockdown and A37 ((ethyl-2-((4-oxo-3-(3-(pryrrolidin-1-yl)propyl)-3,4-dihydrobenzo [4,5]thioeno [3,2-d]pyrimidin-2-yl)thio)acetate)), a novel ALDH1A1 small-molecule enzymatic inhibitor described here for the first time, disrupted OC spheroid formation and cell viability (P<0.001). β-Catenin knockdown blocked tumor growth and peritoneal metastasis in an OC xenograft model. These data strongly support the role of β-catenin-regulated ALDH1A1 in the maintenance of OC spheroids and propose new ALDH1A1 inhibitors targeting this cell population."
https://openalex.org/W1974049018,"Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) characterized by loss of sensory sensitivity and pain in hands and feet is the major dose-limiting toxicity of many chemotherapeutics. At present, there are no FDA-approved treatments for CIPN. The anti-diabetic drug metformin is the most widely used prescription drug in the world and improves glycemic control in diabetes patients. There is some evidence that metformin enhances the efficacy of cancer treatment. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that metformin protects against chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain and sensory deficits. Mice were treated with cisplatin together with metformin or saline. Cisplatin induced increased sensitivity to mechanical stimulation (mechanical allodynia) as measured using the von Frey test. Co-administration of metformin almost completely prevented the cisplatin-induced mechanical allodynia. Co-administration of metformin also prevented paclitaxel-induced mechanical allodynia. The capacity of the mice to detect an adhesive patch on their hind paw was used as a novel indicator of chemotherapy-induced sensory deficits. Co-administration of metformin prevented the cisplatin-induced increase in latency to detect the adhesive patch indicating that metformin prevents sensory deficits as well. Moreover, metformin prevented the reduction in density of intra-epidermal nerve fibers (IENFs) in the paw that develops as a result of cisplatin treatment. We conclude that metformin protects against pain and loss of tactile function in a mouse model of CIPN. The finding that metformin reduces loss of peripheral nerve endings indicates that mechanism underlying the beneficial effects of metformin includes a neuroprotective activity. Because metformin is widely used for treatment of type II diabetes, has a broad safety profile, and is currently being tested as an adjuvant drug in cancer treatment, clinical translation of these findings could be rapidly achieved."

Octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (Oct4) is an important regulator of embryonic stem cell fate. Here, we investigated whether Oct4 regulates stemness of head and neck squamous carcinoma (HNSC) CSCs. Our study showed that ectopic expression of Oct4 promotes tumor growth through cyclin E activation, increases chemoresistance through ABCC6 expression and enhances tumor invasion through slug expression. Also, Oct4 dedifferentiates differentiated HNSC cells to CSC-like cells. Furthermore, Oct4high HNSC CSCs have more stem cell-like traits compared with Oct4low cells, such as self-renewal, stem cell markers' expression, chemoresistance, invasion capacity and xenograft tumorigeneity in vitro and in vivo. In addition, knockdown of Oct4 led to markedly lower HNSC CSC stemness. Finally, there was a significant correlation between Oct4 expression and survival of 119 HNSC patients. Collectively, these data suggest that Oct4 may be a critical regulator of HNSC CSCs and its targeting may be potentially valuable in the treatment of HNSC CSCs."
https://openalex.org/W2081787112,"There is now compelling evidence to indicate a place for heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) in mammary carcinogenesis, tumour progression and metastasis. Here we have investigated a role for HSF1 in regulating the expression of the stem cell renewal factor β-catenin in immortalized human mammary epithelial and carcinoma cells. We found HSF1 to be involved in regulating the translation of β-catenin, by investigating effects of gain and loss of HSF1 on this protein. Interestingly, although HSF1 is a potent transcription factor, it was not directly involved in regulating levels of β-catenin mRNA. Instead, our data suggest a complex role in translational regulation. HSF1 was shown to regulate levels of the RNA-binding protein HuR that controlled β-catenin translation. An extra complexity was added to this scenario when it was shown that the long non-coding RNA molecule lincRNA-p21, known to be involved in β-catenin mRNA (CTNNB1) translational regulation, was controlled by HSF1 repression. We have shown previously that HSF1 was positively regulated through phosphorylation by mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase on a key residue, serine 326, essential for transcriptional activity. In this study, we found that mTOR knockdown not only decreased HSF1-S326 phosphorylation in mammary cells, but also decreased β-catenin expression through a mechanism requiring HuR. Our data point to a complex role for HSF1 in the regulation of HuR and β-catenin expression that may be significant in mammary carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2089855130,"Background Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) is a secular form of meditation training. The vast majority of the extant literature investigating the health effects of mindfulness interventions relies on wait-list control comparisons. Previous studies have found that meditation training over several months is associated with improvements in cognitive control and attention. Methodology/Principal Findings We used a visual continuous performance task (CPT) to test the effects of eight weeks of mindfulness training on sustained attention by comparing MBSR to the Health Enhancement Program (HEP), a structurally equivalent, active control condition in a randomized, longitudinal design (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01301105) focusing on a non-clinical population typical of MBSR participants. Researchers were blind to group assignment. 63 community participants were randomized to either MBSR (n = 31) or HEP (n = 32). CPT analyses were conducted on 29 MBSR participants and 25 HEP participants. We predicted that MBSR would improve visual discrimination ability and sustained attention over time on the CPT compared to HEP, with more home practice associated with greater improvements. Our hypotheses were not confirmed but we did find some evidence for improved visual discrimination similar to effects in partial replication of other research. Our study had sufficient power to demonstrate that intervention groups do not differ in their improvement over time in sustained attention performance. One of our primary predictions concerning the effects of intervention on attentional fatigue was significant but not interpretable. Conclusions Attentional sensitivity is not affected by mindfulness practice as taught in MBSR, but it is unclear whether mindfulness might positively affect another aspect of attention, vigilance. These results also highlight the relevant procedural modifications required by future research to correctly investigate the role of sustained attention in similar samples.

https://openalex.org/W2015057249,"Disease progression and recurrence are major barriers to survival for breast cancer patients. Understanding the etiology of recurrent or metastatic breast cancer and underlying mechanisms is critical for the development of new treatments and improved survival. Here, we report that two commonly overexpressed breast cancer oncogenes, Ron (Recepteur d’Origine Nantaise) and DEK, cooperate to promote advanced disease through multipronged effects on β-catenin signaling. The Ron receptor is commonly activated in breast cancers, and Ron overexpression in human disease stimulates β-catenin nuclear translocation and is an independent predictor of metastatic dissemination. Dek is a chromatin-associated oncogene whose expression has been linked to cancer through multiple mechanisms, including β-catenin activity. We demonstrate here that Dek is a downstream target of Ron receptor activation in murine and human models. The absence of Dek in the MMTV-Ron mouse model led to a significant delay in tumor development, characterized by decreased cell proliferation, diminished metastasis and fewer cells expressing mammary cancer stem cell markers. Dek complementation of cell lines established from this model was sufficient to promote cellular growth and invasion. Mechanistically, Dek expression stimulated the production and secretion of Wnt ligands to sustain an autocrine/paracrine canonical β-catenin signaling loop. Finally, we show that Dek overexpression promotes tumorigenic phenotypes in immortalized human mammary epithelial MCF10A cells and, in the context of Ron receptor activation, correlates with disease recurrence and metastasis in patients. Overall, our studies demonstrate that DEK overexpression, due in part to Ron receptor activation, drives breast cancer progression through the induction of Wnt/β-catenin signaling."

Aqueous extract of such leaves have been used as an indigenous remedy for respiratory diseases like asthma and coughing in traditional Chinese medicine. However, underlying molecular mechanisms of mangiferin on anti-asthma remain unclear. In our present study, we investigated the anti-asthmatic effect of mangiferin on Th1/Th2 cytokine profiles and explored its underlying immunoregulatory mechanism in mouse model of allergic asthma. Mangiferin significantly reduced the total inflammatory cell counts and eosinophil infiltration, decreased the production of ovalbumin-specific IgE in serum and PGD2 in BALF. The antibody array analysis showed that mangiferin down-regulated the levels of one group of cytokines/chemokines including Th2-related IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and others IL-3, IL-9, IL-17, RANTES, TNF-α, but simultaneously up-regulated Th1-related IFN-γ, IL-2 and IL-10 and IL-12 expression in serum. Thus it attenuates the imbalance of Th1/Th2 cells ratio by diminishing the abnormal mRNA levels of Th1 cytokines (IFN-γ and IL-12) and Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13). Finally, mangiferin substantially inhibited the activation and expression of STAT-6 and GATA-3 in excised lung tissues. Our results suggest that mangiferin can exert anti-asthmatic effect. The underlying mechanism may attribute to the modulation of Th1/Th2 cytokine imbalance via inhibiting the STAT6 signaling pathway."

The composite Model for End-Stage Liver Disease excluding INR (MELD-XI) is a robust scoring system of liver function, and a high score is associated with poor prognosis in advanced HF patients with a heart transplantation and/or ventricular assist device. However, the impact of MELD-XI on the prognosis of HF patients in general remains unclear.We retrospectively analyzed 562 patients who were admitted to our hospital for the treatment of decompensated HF. A MELD-XI score was graded, and patients were divided into two groups based on the median value of MELD-XI score: Group L (MELD-XI <10, n = 289) and Group H (MELD-XI ≥10, n = 273). We compared all-cause mortality and echocardiographic findings between the two groups. In the follow-up period (mean 471 days), 104 deaths (62 cardiac deaths and 42 non-cardiac deaths) were observed. The event (cardiac death, non-cardiac death, all-cause death)-free rate was significantly higher in group L than in group H (logrank P<0.05, respectively). In the Cox proportional hazard analysis, a high MELD-XI score was found to be an independent predictor of cardiac deaths and all-cause mortality in HF patients. Regarding echocardiographic parameters, right atrial and ventricular areas, inferior vena cava diameter, and systolic pulmonary artery pressure were higher in group H than in group L (P<0.05, respectively).The MELD-XI scoring system, a marker of liver function, can identify high-risk patients with right heart volume overload, higher pulmonary arterial pressure and multiple organ failure associated with HF."
https://openalex.org/W2021984876,"Glioblastomas are aggressive adult brain tumors, characterized by inadequately organized vasculature and consequent nutrient and oxygen (O2)-depleted areas. Adaptation to low nutrients and hypoxia supports glioblastoma cell survival, progression and therapeutic resistance. However, specific mechanisms promoting cellular survival under nutrient and O2 deprivation remain incompletely understood. Here, we show that miR-124 expression is negatively correlated with a hypoxic gene signature in glioblastoma patient samples, suggesting that low miR-124 levels contribute to pro-survival adaptive pathways in this disease. As miR-124 expression is repressed in various cancer types (including glioblastoma), we quantified miR-124 abundance in normoxic and hypoxic regions in glioblastoma patient tissue, and investigated whether ectopic miR-124 expression compromises cell survival during tumor ischemia. Our results indicate that miR-124 levels are further diminished in hypoxic/ischemic regions within individual glioblastoma patient samples, compared with regions replete in O2 and nutrients. Importantly, we also show that increased miR-124 expression affects the ability of tumor cells to survive under O2 and/or nutrient deprivation. Moreover, miR-124 re-expression increases cell death in vivo and enhances the survival of mice bearing intracranial xenograft tumors. miR-124 exerts this phenotype in part by directly regulating TEAD1, MAPK14/p38α and SERP1, factors involved in cell proliferation and survival under stress. Simultaneous suppression of these miR-124 targets results in similar levels of cell death as caused by miR-124 restoration. Importantly, we further demonstrate that SERP1 reintroduction reverses the hypoxic cell death elicited by miR-124, indicating the importance of SERP1 in promoting tumor cell survival. In support of our experimental data, we observed a significant correlation between high SERP1 levels and poor patient outcome in glioblastoma patients. Collectively, among the many pro-tumorigeneic properties of miR-124 repression in glioblastoma, we delineated a novel role in promoting tumor cell survival under stressful microenvironments, thereby supporting tumor progression."
https://openalex.org/W1974762491,"Crosstalk between estrogen receptor (ER) and the inflammatory nuclear factor κB (NFκB) pathway in ER+ breast cancers may contribute to a more aggressive phenotype. Pleckstrin Homology-Like Domain, Family A, member 1 (PHLDA1), a target gene of ER-NFκB crosstalk, has been implicated in cell survival and stem cell properties. 17β-estradiol (E2), acting through ERα, and pro-inflammatory cytokines, acting through NFκB, increase the nascent transcript and PHLDA1 messenger RNA stability, indicating both transcriptional and post-transcriptional control of PHLDA1 expression. We show that PHLDA1 is a direct target of miR-181 and that mature miR-181a and b, as well as their host gene, are synergistically downregulated by E2 and tumor necrosis factor α, also in an ER- and NFκB-dependent manner. Thus, ER and NFκB work together to upregulate PHLDA1 directly through enhanced transcription and indirectly through repression of miR-181a and b. Previous studies have suggested that PHLDA1 may be a stem cell marker in the human intestine that contributes to tumorigenesis. Our findings that PHLDA1 is upregulated in mammospheres (MS) of ER+ breast cancer cells and that PHLDA1 knockdown impairs both MS formation and the expansion of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)-positive population, suggest that PHLDA1 may play a similar role in breast cancer cells. Upregulation of PHLDA1 in MS is largely dependent on the NFκB pathway, with downregulated miR-181 expression a contributing factor. Over-expression of miR-181 phenocopied PHLDA1 knockdown and significantly impaired MS formation, which was reversed, in part, by protection of the PHLDA1 3′ untranslated region (UTR) or overexpression of PHLDA1 lacking the 3′UTR. Furthermore, we find that elevated PHLDA1 expression is associated with a higher risk of distant metastasis in ER+ breast cancer patients. Altogether, these data suggest that high PHLDA1 expression is controlled through an ER-NFκB-miR-181 regulatory axis and may contribute to a poor clinical outcome in patients with ER+ breast tumors by enhancing stem-like properties in these tumors."

CD24+ cells possess typical CSC characteristics that include enhanced cell proliferation, increased colony and sphere formation, maintenance of cell differentiation potential in prolonged culture, and enhanced resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs. Notably, CD24+ cells produce tumors following inoculation of as few as 500 cells in immunodeficient NOD/SCID mice.

MlIW172 was closely linked with the RFLP probe Xpsr680-derived STS marker Xmag2185 and the EST markers BE405531 and BE637476. This suggested that MlIW172 might be allelic to the Pm1 locus or a new locus closely linked to Pm1. By screening genomic BAC library of durum wheat cv. Langdon and 7AL-specific BAC library of hexaploid wheat cv. Chinese Spring, and after analyzing genome scaffolds of Triticum urartu containing the marker sequences, additional markers were developed to construct a fine genetic linkage map on the MlIW172 locus region and to delineate the resistance gene within a 0.48 cM interval. Comparative genetics analyses using ESTs and RFLP probe sequences flanking the MlIW172 region against other grass species revealed a general co-linearity in this region with the orthologous genomic regions of rice chromosome 6, Brachypodium chromosome 1, and sorghum chromosome 10.

The greater white-toothed shrew (Crocidura russula) is an invasive species in Ireland that was first recorded in 2007 and which, according to initial data, may be limiting the abundance/distribution of the pygmy shrew (Sorex minutus), previously Ireland's only shrew species. Because of these concerns, we undertook an intensive live-trapping survey (and used other data from live-trapping, sightings and bird of prey pellets/nest inspections collected between 2006 and 2013) to model the distribution and expansion of C. russula in Ireland and its impacts on Ireland's small mammal community. The main distribution range of C. russula was found to be approximately 7,600 km2 in 2013, with established outlier populations suggesting that the species is dispersing with human assistance within the island. The species is expanding rapidly for a small mammal, with a radial expansion rate of 5.5 km/yr overall (2008–2013), and independent estimates from live-trapping in 2012–2013 showing rates of 2.4–14.1 km/yr, 0.5–7.1 km/yr and 0–5.6 km/yr depending on the landscape features present. S. minutus is negatively associated with C. russula. S. minutus is completely absent at sites where C. russula is established and is only present at sites at the edge of and beyond the invasion range of C. russula. The speed of this invasion and the homogenous nature of the Irish landscape may mean that S. minutus has not had sufficient time to adapt to the sudden appearance of C. russula. This may mean the continued decline/disappearance of S. minutus as C. russula spreads throughout the island."
https://openalex.org/W2083693209,"ETS family transcription factors regulate diverse genes through binding at cognate DNA sites that overlap substantially in sequence. The DNA-binding domains of ETS proteins (ETS domains) are highly conserved structurally yet share limited amino acid homology. To define the mechanistic implications of sequence diversity within the ETS family, we characterized the thermodynamics and kinetics of DNA site recognition by the ETS domains of Ets-1 and PU.1, which represent the extremes in amino acid divergence among ETS proteins. Even though the two ETS domains bind their optimal sites with similar affinities under physiologic conditions, their nature of site recognition differs strikingly in terms of the role of hydration and counter ion release. The data suggest two distinct mechanisms wherein Ets-1 follows a “dry” mechanism that rapidly parses sites through electrostatic interactions and direct protein-DNA contacts, whereas PU.1 utilizes hydration to interrogate sequence-specific sites and form a long-lived complex relative to the Ets-1 counterpart. The kinetic persistence of the high affinity PU.1·DNA complex may be relevant to an emerging role of PU.1, but not Ets-1, as a pioneer transcription factor in vivo. In addition, PU.1 activity is critical to the development and function of macrophages and lymphocytes, which present osmotically variable environments, and hydration-dependent specificity may represent an important regulatory mechanism in vivo, a hypothesis that finds support in gene expression profiles of primary murine macrophages. ETS family transcription factors regulate diverse genes through binding at cognate DNA sites that overlap substantially in sequence. The DNA-binding domains of ETS proteins (ETS domains) are highly conserved structurally yet share limited amino acid homology. To define the mechanistic implications of sequence diversity within the ETS family, we characterized the thermodynamics and kinetics of DNA site recognition by the ETS domains of Ets-1 and PU.1, which represent the extremes in amino acid divergence among ETS proteins. Even though the two ETS domains bind their optimal sites with similar affinities under physiologic conditions, their nature of site recognition differs strikingly in terms of the role of hydration and counter ion release.

https://openalex.org/W2015627512,"Endometriosis, defined as the presence of endometrial cells outside of the uterine cavity, is a major cause of infertility and pelvic pain, afflicting more than 10% of reproductive age women. Endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory disease and lipopolysaccharide promotes the proliferation and invasion of endometriotic stromal cells. Cysteine-rich secretory protein LCCL domain-containing 2 (CRISPLD2) has high affinity for lipopolysaccharide and plays a critical role in defense against endotoxin shock. However, the function of CRISPLD2 has not been studied in endometriosis and uterine biology. Herein, we examined the expression of CRISPLD2 in endometrium from patients with and without endometriosis using immunohistochemistry. The expression of CRISPLD2 was higher in the secretory phase in human menstrual cycle compared to proliferative phase. The expression of CRISPLD2 was significantly decreased in the endometrium of women with endometriosis in the early secretory phase compared to women without endometriosis. The increase of CRISPLD2 expression at the early secretory and dysregulation of its expression in endometriosis suggest progesterone (P4) regulation of CRISPLD2. To investigate whether CRISPLD2 is regulated by P4, we examined the expression of the CRISPLD2 in the uteri of wild-type and progesterone receptor knock out (PRKO) mice. The expression of CRISPLD2 was significantly increased after P4 treatment in the wild-type mice. However, CRISPLD2 expression was significantly decreased in the (PRKO) mice treated with P4. During early pregnancy, the expression of CRISPLD2 was increased in decidua of implantation and post-implantation stages. CRISPLD2 levels were also increased in cultured human endometrial stromal cells during in vitro decidualization. These results suggest that the CRISPLD2 is a target of the progesterone receptor and may play an important role in pathogenesis of endometriosis."
https://openalex.org/W2136711150,"Bacterial conjugation in the human gut microbiota is believed to play a major role in the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes and virulence plasmids. However, the modulation of bacterial conjugation by the human host remains poorly understood and there is a need for controlled systems to study this process. We established an in vitro co-culture system to study the interaction between human intestinal cells and bacteria. We show that the conjugation efficiency of a plasmid encoding an extended spectrum beta-lactamase is reduced when clinical isolates of Escherichia coli are co-cultured with human intestinal cells. We show that filtered media from co-cultures contain a factor that reduces conjugation efficiency. Protease treatment of the filtered media eliminates this inhibition of conjugation. This data suggests that a peptide or protein based factor is secreted on the apical side of the intestinal cells exposed to bacteria leading to a two-fold reduction in conjugation efficiency. These results show that human gut epithelial cells can modulate bacterial conjugation and may have relevance to gene exchange in the gut."
https://openalex.org/W1549577812,"Heat shock protein (Hsp)90 regulates many key pathways in oncogenesis, including Akt and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). The strengths of disruption of Hsp90 in cancer therapy include their versatility in inhibiting a wide range of oncogenic pathways. The present study demonstrated that synuclein γ (SNCG) protects the functions of Akt and mTOR in the condition when the function of Hsp90 is blocked. Disruption of Hsp90 abolished Akt activity and mTOR signaling. However, expression of SNCG restored Akt activity and mTOR signaling. SNCG bound to Akt and mTOR in the presence and absence of Hsp90. Specifically, the C-terminal (Gln106-Asp127) of SNCG bound to the loop connecting αC helix and β4 sheet of the kinase domain of Akt. SNCG renders resistance to 17-AAG-induced apoptosis both in vitro and in tumor xenograft. A clinical follow-up study indicates that patients with an SNCG-positive breast cancer have a significantly shorter disease-free survival and overall survival than patients with SNCG-negative tumors. The present study indicates that SNCG protects Hsp90 client proteins of Akt and mTOR, and renders drug resistance to Hsp90 disruption."
https://openalex.org/W1999761245,"Changes in gene expression programs play a central role in cancer. Chromosomal aberrations such as deletions, duplications and translocations of DNA segments can lead to highly significant positive correlations of gene expression levels of neighboring genes. This should be utilized to improve the analysis of tumor expression profiles. Here, we develop a novel model class of autoregressive higher-order Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) that carefully exploit local data-dependent chromosomal dependencies to improve the identification of differentially expressed genes in tumor. Autoregressive higher-order HMMs overcome generally existing limitations of standard first-order HMMs in the modeling of dependencies between genes in close chromosomal proximity by the simultaneous usage of higher-order state-transitions and autoregressive emissions as novel model features. We apply autoregressive higher-order HMMs to the analysis of breast cancer and glioma gene expression data and perform in-depth model evaluation studies. We find that autoregressive higher-order HMMs clearly improve the identification of overexpressed genes with underlying gene copy number duplications in breast cancer in comparison to mixture models, standard first- and higher-order HMMs, and other related methods. The performance benefit is attributed to the simultaneous usage of higher-order state-transitions in combination with autoregressive emissions. This benefit could not be reached by using each of these two features independently. We also find that autoregressive higher-order HMMs are better able to identify differentially expressed genes in tumors independent of the underlying gene copy number status in comparison to the majority of related methods. This is further supported by the identification of well-known and of previously unreported hotspots of differential expression in glioblastomas demonstrating the efficacy of autoregressive higher-order HMMs for the analysis of individual tumor expression profiles. Moreover, we reveal interesting novel details of systematic alterations of gene expression levels in known cancer signaling pathways distinguishing oligodendrogliomas, astrocytomas and glioblastomas. An implementation is available under www.jstacs.de/index.php/ARHMM."
https://openalex.org/W2026661144,"In recent years there has been an increasing interest in overprotective parenting and the potential role it plays in child development. While some have argued that a trend towards increased parental fear and reduced opportunity for independent mobility may be linked to increasing rates of child overweight and obesity, there is limited empirical information available to support this claim. Using data from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children, this study aimed to examine the longitudinal relationships between maternal protectiveness and child overweight and obesity. A cohort of 4–5 year old children was followed up at 6–7, 8–9 and 10–11 years of age (n = 2596). Measures included a protective parenting scale administered when children were 6–7 and 8–9 years of age, child body mass index (BMI), family characteristics including household income, neighbourhood disadvantage, child's position amongst siblings, and maternal BMI, education, employment, mental health and age at first birth. International Obesity Taskforce age- and sex-specific BMI cut points were used to determine if children were in the normal, overweight or obese BMI range. There was no association between maternal protectiveness and the odds of children being overweight or obese at age 4–5, 6–7 or 8–9 years. However at age 10–11 years, a 1 standard deviation increase in maternal protectiveness was associated with a 13% increase in the odds of children being overweight or obese. The results provide evidence of a relationship between maternal protectiveness and child overweight and obesity, however further research is required to understand the mechanism(s) that links the two concepts."
https://openalex.org/W1997924465,"Chlamydia trachomatis is an obligate intracellular bacterial pathogen and the second leading cause of sexually transmitted infections in the US. Infections cause significant morbidity and can lead to serious reproductive sequelae, including an epidemiological link to increased rates of reproductive cancers. One of the overt changes that infected cells exhibit is the development of genomic instability leading to multinucleation. Here we demonstrate that the induction of multinucleation is not conserved equally across chlamydial species; C. trachomatis L2 caused high levels of multinucleation, C. muridarum intermediate levels, and C. caviae had very modest effects on multinucleation. Our data show that at least two effector pathways together cause genomic instability during infection leading to multinucleation. We find that the highly conserved chlamydial protease CPAF is a key effector for one of these pathways. CPAF secretion is required for the loss of centrosome duplication regulation as well as inducing early mitotic exit. The second effector pathway involves the induction of centrosome position errors. This function is not conserved in three chlamydial species tested. Together these two pathways contribute to the induction of high levels of genomic instability and multinucleation seen in C. trachomatis infections."

We performed extended site-directed mutagenesis and measured binding rate constants through surface plasmon resonance analysis. These data, supported by molecular dynamics simulations, suggest that the unstructured tail plays a double role in the reaction mechanism. On the one hand, it facilitates the formation of an encounter complex through long range electrostatic interactions; on the other hand, it directly contacts the G-quadruplex scaffold through multiple and transient electrostatic interactions, significantly enlarging the contact surface.

As pigs are natural hosts for influenza A viruses and pigs possess both NKp46− and NKp46+ NK cells, they represent a good animal model for studying the role of the NKp46 receptor during influenza. We explored the role of NK cells in piglets experimentally infected with 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus by flow cytometric analyses of cells isolated from blood and lung tissue and by immunostaining of lung tissue sections. The number of NKp46+ NK cells was reduced while NKp46− NK cells remained unaltered in the blood 1–3 days after infection. In the lungs, the intensity of NKp46 expression on NK cells was increased during the first 3 days, and areas where influenza virus nucleoprotein was detected were associated with increased numbers of NKp46+ NK cells when compared to uninfected areas. NKp46+ NK cells in the lung were neither found to be infected with influenza virus nor to be undergoing apoptosis. The binding of porcine NKp46 to influenza virus infected cells was verified in an in vitro assay. These data support the involvement of porcine NKp46+ NK cells in the local immune response against influenza virus."
https://openalex.org/W2052211018,"Eyes absent 1 (Eya1) is a conserved critical regulator of organ-specific stem cells. Ectopic Eya1 activities, however, promote transformation of mammary epithelial cells. Signals that instigate Eya1 oncogenic activities remain to be determined. Here, we show that Akt1 kinase physically interacts with Eya1 and phosphorylates a conserved consensus site of the Akt kinase. PI3K/Akt signaling enhances Eya1 transcription activity, which largely attributes to the phosphorylation-induced reduction of Eya1 SUMOylation. Indeed, SUMOylation inhibits Eya1 transcription activity; and pharmacologic and genetic activation of PI3K/Akt robustly reduces Eya1 SUMOylation. Wild-type but not Akt phosphorylation site mutant Eya1 variant rescues the cell migratory phenotype of EYA1-silenced breast cancer cells, highlighting the importance of Eya1 phosphorylation. Furthermore, knockdown EYA1 sensitizes breast cancer cells to the PI3K/Akt1 inhibitor and irradiation treatments. Thus, the PI3K/Akt signal pathway activates Eya1. These findings further suggest that regulation of SUMOylation by PI3K/Akt signaling is likely an important aspect of tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2093747979,"Organophosphorus (OP) nerve agents are deadly chemical weapons that pose an alarming threat to military and civilian populations. The irreversible inhibition of the critical cholinergic degradative enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) by OP nerve agents leads to cholinergic crisis. Resulting excessive synaptic acetylcholine levels leads to status epilepticus that, in turn, results in brain damage. Current countermeasures are only modestly effective in protecting against OP-induced brain damage, supporting interest for evaluation of new ones. (-)-Phenserine is a reversible AChE inhibitor possessing neuroprotective and amyloid precursor protein lowering actions that reached Phase III clinical trials for Alzheimer's Disease where it exhibited a wide safety margin. This compound preferentially enters the CNS and has potential to impede soman binding to the active site of AChE to, thereby, serve in a protective capacity. Herein, we demonstrate that (-)-phenserine protects neurons against soman-induced neuronal cell death in rats when administered either as a pretreatment or post-treatment paradigm, improves motoric movement in soman-exposed animals and reduces mortality when given as a pretreatment. Gene expression analysis, undertaken to elucidate mechanism, showed that (-)-phenserine pretreatment increased select neuroprotective genes and reversed a Homer1expression elevation induced by soman exposure. These studies suggest that (-)-phenserine warrants further evaluation as an OP nerve agent protective strategy."
https://openalex.org/W2011090938,"The central nervous system undergoing degeneration can be stabilized, and in some models can be restored to function, by neuroprotective treatments. Photobiomodulation (PBM) and dietary saffron are distinctive as neuroprotectants in that they upregulate protective mechanisms, without causing measurable tissue damage. This study reports a first attempt to combine the actions of PBM and saffron. Our working hypothesis was that the actions of PBM and saffron in protecting retinal photoreceptors, in a rat light damage model, would be additive. Results confirmed the neuroprotective potential of each used separately, but gave no evidence that their effects are additive. Detailed analysis suggests that there is actually a negative interaction between PBM and saffron when given simultaneously, with a consequent reduction of the neuroprotection. Specific testing will be required to understand the mechanisms involved and to establish whether there is clinical potential in combining neuroprotectants, to improve the quality of life of people affected by retinal pathology, such as age-related macular degeneration, the major cause of blindness and visual impairment in older adults."

Additionally we evaluated the influence of statin treatment on circulating BOEC precursors in subjects with subclinical atherosclerosis.Patients with premature CAD (men <51 yr, women <56 yr) and their FDRs were included. Based on coronary calcification (CAC) scores FDRs were divided in a group of healthy subjects (CAC = 0) and subjects with subclinical atherosclerosis (CAC>0). We did not observe differences in the number of BOEC colonies and proliferation between premature CAD patients and FDRs. FDRs with subclinical atherosclerosis had lower colony numbers compared with healthy FDRs, however this was not statistically significant, and BOEC proliferation was significantly impaired (OR = 0.45, 95% CI 0.21-0.96). Unexpectedly, the number of BOEC colonies and BOEC proliferation were similar for premature CAD patients and healthy FDRs. Since a considerable number of premature CAD patients used statins, we studied the number of BOEC precursors as well as their proliferative capacity in ten individuals with subclinical atherosclerosis, before and after statin therapy. Interestingly, FDRs with subclinical atherosclerosis showed a significant increase in the number of BOEC colonies after statin therapy.BOEC proliferation of subjects with subclinical atherosclerosis is impaired compared with healthy controls. In these subjects, statin therapy significantly increased the number of circulating BOEC precursors as well as their proliferative capacity, revealing a beneficial effect of statins on endothelial regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2024837263,"The aim of this study was to provide reliable information on dyslipidaemias, to estimate the trend of the prevalence of dyslipidaemias and other selected cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors at population level, and to evaluate the risk of all-cause and CVD mortality in relation to presence of mixed dyslipidaemias and other CVD risk factors. Methods Data from the five surveys (1983–2008) are presented. A random sample of 9,209 subjects aged 45–64 was selected for statistical analysis. During follow-up there were 1653 death cases from any cause, 864 deaths from CVD. Estimates of hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were based on the multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression for all-cause mortality and CVD mortality. Results During 25 year period the prevalence of normal total cholesterol level (<5.2 mmol/L) significantly increased only in women; triglycerides and high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol did not change in men and women. Findings in our longitudinal study showed that in men and women mixed dyslipidaemias (HDL cholesterol <1.03 mmol/L plus triglycerides ≥1.70 mmol/L) significantly increased the risk for all-cause and CVD mortality (respectively in men HR = 1.30; HR = 1.15, in women HR = 1.83; HR = 2.13). These mixed dyslipidaemia combinations combination with the other risk factors such as arterial hypertension, high fasting glucose level increased all-cause and CVD mortality risk in men and women; while, these mixed dyslipidaemias plus smoking increased all-cause and CVD mortality risk only in men compared to never smokers without these dyslipidaemias (respectively HR = 1.89; HR = 1.92); and these dyslipidaemias plus obesity increased all-cause and CVD mortality risk in women (respectively HR = 2.25; HR = 2.39) and CVD mortality risk in men (HR = 1.72), as compared to responders without obesity and these dyslipidaemias. Conclusion Mixed dyslipidaemias (reduced HDL cholesterol plus elevated triglycerides) significantly increased the risk for all-cause and CVD mortality in this Lithuanian population aged 45–64 years."
https://openalex.org/W1976825667,"Although height (H) has been considered the principal anthropometric variable governing lung function, the age-dependent differences in its influences on determining spirometric parameters (SPs) have not been conclusively investigated. Moreover, there has been no study centered on age-dependent effects of other anthropometric variables, including body weight (BW) and body fat mass (BFM) on SPs. In addition, the age-dependent influences of these anthropometric variables are anticipated to differ quantitatively between male and female participants.A total of 16,919 nonsmoking healthy Japanese adults (men: 6,116, women: 10,803) were partitioned into six groups stratified by gender and age at intervals of 20-years: young-, middle-, and advanced-age groups of either gender. Using a model in which a SP was described by a logarithmic additive function of age, H, BW, and BFM, we determined the partial regression coefficients of the respective anthropometric variables to predict the reference means of SPs, including FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC, PEF, FEF50, and FEF75, in the six groups.Although the impact of H on FVC and FEV1 was relatively homogeneous irrespective of gender and age, its homogeneity faded for flow parameters, particularly in the female middle- and advanced-age groups, indicating that the age-dependent contribution of H to SPs was enhanced more in women. The impact of BW on SPs differed depending on age, and this effect was also more conspicuous for female participants. H and BW generally exerted positive effects on SPs, whereas BFM had negative effects. Opposite effects of BW and BFM were observed in the female middle-age group in particular.The effects of anthropometric variables on spirometric parameters are highly age-dependent, particularly in women, leading to the conclusion that the assumption of age-independent, constant partial regression coefficients of anthropometric variables while predicting the reference mean of a certain spirometric parameter may result in substantial errors."
https://openalex.org/W1979981320,"Map-based cloning (MBC) is the conventional approach for linking phenotypes to genotypes, and has been successfully used to identify causal mutations in diverse organisms. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies offer unprecedented possibilities to sequence the entire genomes of organisms, thereby in principle enabling direct identification of causal mutations without mapping. However, although mapping-by-sequencing has proven to be a cost effective alternative to classical MBC in particular situations, methods based solely on NGS still have limitations and need to be refined. Aiming to identify the causal mutations in suppressors of Arabidopsis thaliana superroot2 phenotype, generated by ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS) treatment, we combined NGS and classical mapping, to rapidly identify the point mutations and restrict the number of testable candidates by defining the chromosomal intervals containing the causal mutations, respectively. The NGS-assisted mapping approach we describe here facilitates unbiased identification of virtually any causal EMS-generated mutation by overlapping the identification (deep sequencing) and validation (mapping) steps. To exemplify the useful marriage of the two approaches we discuss the strategy used to identify a new viable recessive allele of the Arabidopsis CULLIN1 gene in the non-reference Wassilewskija (Ws-4) accession."
https://openalex.org/W2009595321,"Objective The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of a new blood pressure (BP) measurement method (Pulse method). Methods This study enrolled 45 patients for selective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) via right radial artery. A BP device using either oscillometric (Microlife 3AC1-1) or Pulse method(RG-BP11)was used. At the beginning of each PCI, intra-radial BP was measured before Microlife BP or Pulse BP measurement as its own reference, respectively. At the end of PCI, BP was measured again with the measurement order of Microlife BP and Pulse BP reversed. The differences between intra-radial and Microlife (BPi-M) or Pulse BP (BPi-P) on SBP, DBP and mean artery pressure (MAP) were calculated. Meanwhile, in 48 patients the intra-brachial BP and intra-radial artery BP were measured to calculate the brachial -radial BP difference (BPr-b). Results The intra-radial SBP references used prior to both the Microlife and Pulse SBP that were similar (145.1±27.7 vs 145.8±24.2 mmHg), but the Microlife SBP was significantly lower than the Pulse SBP (127.7±20.5 vs 130.3±22.7 mmHg, P<0.05), thus the SBPi-M was higher than SBPi-P (18.1±11.8 vs 14.8±12.8 mmHg, P<0.05). As the mean SBPr-b was 12.4 mmHg, the Pulse SBP was closer to expected intra-brachial SBP by about 3.3 mmHg than was Microlife SBP to expected intra-brachial SBP. Meanwhile, Bland-Altman plots showed that the 95% limits of agreement for intra-radial SBP by Pulse SBP were narrower than those by Microlife SBP (12.0∼17.5 vs 15.5∼20.6 mmHg). However, the 95% limits of agreement for Pulse DBP and MAP were similar to those for Microlife DBP and MAP. Conclusion Against the invasive BP measurement, the pulse method may provide more accurate SBP and comparable DBP and MAP as compared with the oscillometric method."

However, so far, the efficiency of MSC modification is very low. Seeking for a more efficient way of MSC modification, we investigated the possibility of employing the intercellular trafficking capacity of the herpes simplex virus type-1 tegument protein VP22 on the enhancement of MSC modification. Methods Plasmids pVP22-myc, pVP22-EGFP, pEGFP-VP22, pVP22-hBcl-xL and phBcl-xL-VP22 were constructed for the expressions of the myc-tagged VP22 and the fusion proteins VP22-EGFP, EGFP-VP22, VP22-hBcl-xL and hBcl-xL-VP22. MSCs were isolated from rat bone marrow and the surface markers were identified by Flowcytometry. COS-1 cells were transfected with the above plasmids and co-cultured with untransfected MSCs, the intercellular transportations of the constructed proteins were studied by immunofluorescence. The solubility of VP22-hBcl-xL and hBcl-xL-VP22 was analyzed by Western blot. Results VP22-myc could be expressed in and spread between COS-1 cells, which indicates the validity of our VP22 expression construct. Flowcytometry analysis revealed that the isolated MSCs were CD29, CD44, and CD90 positive and were negative for the hematopoietic markers, CD34 and CD45. The co-culturing and immunofluorescence assay showed that VP22-myc, VP22-EGFP and EGFP-VP22 could traffic between COS-1 cells and MSCs, while the evidence of intercellular transportation of VP22-hBcl-xL and hBcl-xL-VP22 was not detected. Western blot analysis showed that VP22-hBcl-xL and hBcl-xL-VP22 were both insoluble in the cell lysate suggesting interactions of the fusion proteins with other cellular components. Conclusions The intercellular trafficking of VP22-myc, VP22-EGFP and EGFP-VP22 between COS-1 cells and MSCs presents an intriguing prospect in the therapeutic application of VP22 as a delivery vehicle which enhances genetic modifications of MSCs. However, VP22-hBcl-xL and hBcl-xL-VP22 failed to spread between cells, which are due to the insolubility of the fusion protein incurred by interactions with other cellular components."

These repellents did not elicit responses in the lateral styloconic sensilla. Moreover, behavioral studies demonstrated that each repellent deterred feeding. This is the first study to show perception of insect repellents by the gustatory system of a lepidopteran larva and suggests that detection of a range of bitter or aversive compounds may be a broadly conserved feature among insects."
