https://openalex.org/W2010361633,"Gil McVean and colleagues report algorithms for de novo assembly and genotyping of variants using colored de Bruijn graphs and provide these in a software implementation called Cortex. Their methods can detect and genotype both simple and complex genetic variants in either an individual or a population. Detecting genetic variants that are highly divergent from a reference sequence remains a major challenge in genome sequencing. We introduce de novo assembly algorithms using colored de Bruijn graphs for detecting and genotyping simple and complex genetic variants in an individual or population. We provide an efficient software implementation, Cortex, the first de novo assembler capable of assembling multiple eukaryotic genomes simultaneously. Four applications of Cortex are presented. First, we detect and validate both simple and complex structural variations in a high-coverage human genome. Second, we identify more than 3 Mb of sequence absent from the human reference genome, in pooled low-coverage population sequence data from the 1000 Genomes Project. Third, we show how population information from ten chimpanzees enables accurate variant calls without a reference sequence. Last, we estimate classical human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotypes at HLA-B, the most variable gene in the human genome."
https://openalex.org/W2084290194,"Neurotransmitter sodium symporters are integral membrane proteins that remove chemical transmitters from the synapse and terminate neurotransmission mediated by serotonin, dopamine, noradrenaline, glycine and GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid). Crystal structures of the bacterial homologue, LeuT, in substrate-bound outward-occluded and competitive inhibitor-bound outward-facing states have advanced our mechanistic understanding of neurotransmitter sodium symporters but have left fundamental questions unanswered. Here we report crystal structures of LeuT mutants in complexes with conformation-specific antibody fragments in the outward-open and inward-open states. In the absence of substrate but in the presence of sodium the transporter is outward-open, illustrating how the binding of substrate closes the extracellular gate through local conformational changes: hinge-bending movements of the extracellular halves of transmembrane domains 1, 2 and 6, together with translation of extracellular loop 4. The inward-open conformation, by contrast, involves large-scale conformational changes, including a reorientation of transmembrane domains 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7, a marked hinge bending of transmembrane domain 1a and occlusion of the extracellular vestibule by extracellular loop 4. These changes close the extracellular gate, open an intracellular vestibule, and largely disrupt the two sodium sites, thus providing a mechanism by which ions and substrate are released to the cytoplasm. The new structures establish a structural framework for the mechanism of neurotransmitter sodium symporters and their modulation by therapeutic and illicit substances."
https://openalex.org/W2030444684,"Arabidopsis thaliana is native to Eurasia and is naturalized across the world. Its ability to be easily propagated and its high phenotypic variability make it an ideal model system for functional, ecological and evolutionary genetics. To date, analyses of the natural genetic variation of A. thaliana have involved small numbers of individual plants or genetic markers. Here we genotype 1,307 worldwide accessions, including several regional samples, using a 250K SNP chip. This allowed us to produce a high-resolution description of the global pattern of genetic variation. We applied three complementary selection tests and identified new targets of selection. Further, we characterized the pattern of historical recombination in A. thaliana and observed an enrichment of hotspots in its intergenic regions and repetitive DNA, which is consistent with the pattern that is observed for humans but which is strikingly different from that observed in other plant species. We have made the seeds we used to produce this Regional Mapping (RegMap) panel publicly available. This panel comprises one of the largest genomic mapping resources currently available for global natural isolates of a non-human species."

https://openalex.org/W1968376947,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a leading cause of liver disease worldwide. With ∼170 million individuals infected and current interferon-based treatment having toxic side effects and marginal efficacy, more effective antivirals are crucially needed. Although HCV protease inhibitors were just approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), optimal HCV therapy, analogous to HIV therapy, will probably require a combination of antivirals targeting multiple aspects of the viral lifecycle. Viral entry represents a potential multifaceted target for antiviral intervention; however, to date, FDA-approved inhibitors of HCV cell entry are unavailable. Here we show that the cellular Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1) cholesterol uptake receptor is an HCV entry factor amendable to therapeutic intervention. Specifically, NPC1L1 expression is necessary for HCV infection, as silencing or antibody-mediated blocking of NPC1L1 impairs cell culture-derived HCV (HCVcc) infection initiation. In addition, the clinically available FDA-approved NPC1L1 antagonist ezetimibe potently blocks HCV uptake in vitro via a virion cholesterol-dependent step before virion-cell membrane fusion. Moreover, ezetimibe inhibits infection by all major HCV genotypes in vitro and in vivo delays the establishment of HCV genotype 1b infection in mice with human liver grafts. Thus, we have not only identified NPC1L1 as an HCV cell entry factor but also discovered a new antiviral target and potential therapeutic agent."
https://openalex.org/W1973577140,"Histone deacetylase enzymes (HDACs) are emerging cancer drug targets. They regulate gene expression by removing acetyl groups from lysine residues in histone tails, resulting in chromatin condensation. The enzymatic activity of most class I HDACs requires recruitment into multi-subunit co-repressor complexes, which are in turn recruited to chromatin by repressive transcription factors. Here we report the structure of a complex between an HDAC and a co-repressor, namely, human HDAC3 with the deacetylase activation domain (DAD) from the human SMRT co-repressor (also known as NCOR2). The structure reveals two remarkable features. First, the SMRT-DAD undergoes a large structural rearrangement on forming the complex. Second, there is an essential inositol tetraphosphate molecule--D-myo-inositol-(1,4,5,6)-tetrakisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5,6)P(4))--acting as an 'intermolecular glue' between the two proteins. Assembly of the complex is clearly dependent on the Ins(1,4,5,6)P(4), which may act as a regulator--potentially explaining why inositol phosphates and their kinases have been found to act as transcriptional regulators. This mechanism for the activation of HDAC3 appears to be conserved in class I HDACs from yeast to humans, and opens the way to novel therapeutic opportunities."
https://openalex.org/W2049190436,"Functioning and processing of membrane proteins critically depend on the way their transmembrane segments are embedded in the membrane. Sphingolipids are structural components of membranes and can also act as intracellular second messengers. Not much is known of sphingolipids binding to transmembrane domains (TMDs) of proteins within the hydrophobic bilayer, and how this could affect protein function. Here we show a direct and highly specific interaction of exclusively one sphingomyelin species, SM 18, with the TMD of the COPI machinery protein p24 (ref. 2). Strikingly, the interaction depends on both the headgroup and the backbone of the sphingolipid, and on a signature sequence (VXXTLXXIY) within the TMD. Molecular dynamics simulations show a close interaction of SM 18 with the TMD. We suggest a role of SM 18 in regulating the equilibrium between an inactive monomeric and an active oligomeric state of the p24 protein, which in turn regulates COPI-dependent transport. Bioinformatic analyses predict that the signature sequence represents a conserved sphingolipid-binding cavity in a variety of mammalian membrane proteins. Thus, in addition to a function as second messengers, sphingolipids can act as cofactors to regulate the function of transmembrane proteins. Our discovery of an unprecedented specificity of interaction of a TMD with an individual sphingolipid species adds to our understanding of why biological membranes are assembled from such a large variety of different lipids."
https://openalex.org/W2085775776,"20(S)-hydroxycholesterol binds to Smo at a site distinct from cyclopamine and activates signaling via an allosteric mechanism. A new alkyne oxysterol analog selectively captures Smo from membrane extracts and provides a new method for detecting protein-sterol interactions. Oxysterols are a class of endogenous signaling molecules that can activate the Hedgehog pathway, which has critical roles in development, regeneration and cancer. However, it has been unclear how oxysterols influence Hedgehog signaling, including whether their effects are mediated through a protein target or indirectly through effects on membrane properties. To answer this question, we synthesized the enantiomer and an epimer of the most potent oxysterol, 20(S)-hydroxycholesterol. Using these molecules, we show that the effects of oxysterols on Hedgehog signaling are exquisitely stereoselective, consistent with the hypothesis that they function through a specific protein target. We present several lines of evidence that this protein target is the seven-pass transmembrane protein Smoothened, a major drug target in oncology. Our work suggests that these enigmatic sterols, which have multiple effects on cell physiology, may act as ligands for signaling receptors and provides a generally applicable framework for probing sterol signaling mechanisms."

https://openalex.org/W2080248723,"Exogenous double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) has been shown to exert homology-dependent effects at the level of both target mRNA stability and chromatin structure. Using C. elegans undergoing RNAi as an animal model, we have investigated the generality, scope and longevity of dsRNA-targeted chromatin effects and their dependence on components of the RNAi machinery. Using high-resolution genome-wide chromatin profiling, we found that a diverse set of genes can be induced to acquire locus-specific enrichment of histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3), with modification footprints extending several kilobases from the site of dsRNA homology and with locus specificity sufficient to distinguish the targeted locus from the other 20,000 genes in the C. elegans genome. Genetic analysis of the response indicated that factors responsible for secondary siRNA production during RNAi were required for effective targeting of chromatin. Temporal analysis revealed that H3K9me3, once triggered by dsRNA, can be maintained in the absence of dsRNA for at least two generations before being lost. These results implicate dsRNA-triggered chromatin modification in C. elegans as a programmable and locus-specific response defining a metastable state that can persist through generational boundaries."
https://openalex.org/W2061944004,"Multiciliate cells function prominently in the respiratory system, brain ependyma and female reproductive tract to produce vigorous fluid flow along epithelial surfaces. These specialized cells form during development when epithelial progenitors undergo an unusual form of ciliogenesis, in which they assemble and project hundreds of motile cilia. Notch inhibits multiciliate cell formation in diverse epithelia, but how progenitors overcome lateral inhibition and initiate multiciliate cell differentiation is unknown. Here we identify a coiled-coil protein, termed multicilin, which is regulated by Notch and highly expressed in developing epithelia where multiciliate cells form. Inhibiting multicilin function specifically blocks multiciliate cell formation in Xenopus skin and kidney, whereas ectopic expression induces the differentiation of multiciliate cells in ectopic locations. Multicilin localizes to the nucleus, where it directly activates the expression of genes required for multiciliate cell formation, including foxj1 and genes mediating centriole assembly. Multicilin is also necessary and sufficient to promote multiciliate cell differentiation in mouse airway epithelial cultures. These findings indicate that multicilin initiates multiciliate cell differentiation in diverse tissues, by coordinately promoting the transcriptional changes required for motile ciliogenesis and centriole assembly."
https://openalex.org/W2021501314,"Many cellular processes are carried out by molecular 'machines'-assemblies of multiple differentiated proteins that physically interact to execute biological functions. Despite much speculation, strong evidence of the mechanisms by which these assemblies evolved is lacking. Here we use ancestral gene resurrection and manipulative genetic experiments to determine how the complexity of an essential molecular machine--the hexameric transmembrane ring of the eukaryotic V-ATPase proton pump--increased hundreds of millions of years ago. We show that the ring of Fungi, which is composed of three paralogous proteins, evolved from a more ancient two-paralogue complex because of a gene duplication that was followed by loss in each daughter copy of specific interfaces by which it interacts with other ring proteins. These losses were complementary, so both copies became obligate components with restricted spatial roles in the complex. Reintroducing a single historical mutation from each paralogue lineage into the resurrected ancestral proteins is sufficient to recapitulate their asymmetric degeneration and trigger the requirement for the more elaborate three-component ring. Our experiments show that increased complexity in an essential molecular machine evolved because of simple, high-probability evolutionary processes, without the apparent evolution of novel functions. They point to a plausible mechanism for the evolution of complexity in other multi-paralogue protein complexes."
https://openalex.org/W2126840542,"The authors identify a new tumor suppressor role for Smurf2 that is linked to its regulation of histone modifications through RNF20. In the absence of Smurf2 in mice, and potentially also when its nuclear function is compromised in human tumors, higher levels of histone ubiquitination lead to a relaxation of chromatin structure, and alterations in DNA repair result in compromised genomic instability and increased tumorigenesis in aging mice. The findings suggest that loss of Smurf2 function may underlie tumor initiation by reshaping the epigenetic landscape of cells. In addition to allelic mutations, cancers are known to harbor alterations in their chromatin landscape. Here we show that genomic ablation of Smad ubiquitin regulatory factor 2 (Smurf2), a HECT-domain E3 ubiquitin ligase, results in dysregulation of both the DNA damage response and genomic stability, culminating in increased susceptibility to various types of cancers in aged mice. We show that Smurf2 regulates the monoubiquitination of histone H2B as well as the trimethylation of histone H3 at Lys4 and Lys79 by targeting ring finger protein 20 (RNF20) for proteasomal degradation in both mouse and human cells. We also show that Smurf2 and RNF20 are colocalized at the γ-H2AX foci of double-stranded DNA breaks in the nucleus. Thus, Smurf2 has a tumor suppression function that normally maintains genomic stability by controlling the epigenetic landscape of histone modifications through RNF20."
https://openalex.org/W2065079342,"Background Estimation of an individual muscle force still remains one of the main challenges in biomechanics. In this way, the present study aimed: (1) to determine whether an elastography technique called Supersonic Shear Imaging (SSI) could be used to estimate muscle force, (2) to compare this estimation to that one provided by surface electromyography (EMG), and (3) to determine the effect of the pennation of muscle fibers on the accuracy of the estimation. Methods and Results Eleven subjects participated in two experimental sessions; one was devoted to the shear elastic modulus measurements and the other was devoted to the EMG recordings. Each session consisted in: (1) two smooth linear torque ramps from 0 to 60% and from 0 to 30% of maximal voluntary contraction, for the first dorsal interosseous and the abductor digiti minimi, respectively (referred to as “ramp contraction”); (2) two contractions done with the instruction to freely change the torque (referred to as “random changes contraction”). Multi-channel surface EMG recordings were obtained from a linear array of eight electrodes and the shear elastic modulus was measured using SSI. For ramp contractions, significant linear relationships were reported between EMG activity level and torque (R2 = 0.949±0.036), and between shear elastic modulus and torque (R2 = 0.982±0.013). SSI provided significant lower RMSdeviation between measured torque and estimated torque than EMG activity level for both types of contraction (1.4±0.7 vs. 2.8±1.4% of maximal voluntary contraction for “ramp contractions”, p<0.01; 4.5±2.3 vs. 7.9±5.9% of MVC for “random changes contractions”, p<0.05). No significant difference was reported between muscles. Conclusion The shear elastic modulus measured using SSI can provide a more accurate estimation of individual muscle force than surface EMG. In addition, pennation of muscle fibers does not influence the accuracy of the estimation."
https://openalex.org/W2023879783,"Genomic duplications spanning Xq28 are associated with a spectrum of phenotypes, including anxiety and autism. The minimal region shared among affected individuals includes MECP2 and IRAK1, although it is unclear which gene when overexpressed causes anxiety and social behavior deficits. We report that doubling MECP2 levels causes heightened anxiety and autism-like features in mice and alters the expression of genes that influence anxiety and social behavior, such as Crh and Oprm1. To test the hypothesis that alterations in these two genes contribute to heightened anxiety and social behavior deficits, we analyzed MECP2 duplication mice (MECP2-TG1) that have reduced Crh and Oprm1 expression. In MECP2-TG1 animals, reducing the levels of Crh or its receptor, Crhr1, suppressed anxiety-like behavior; in contrast, reducing Oprm1 expression improved abnormal social behavior. These data indicate that increased MeCP2 levels affect molecular pathways underlying anxiety and social behavior and provide new insight into potential therapies for MECP2-related disorders."
https://openalex.org/W1973731651,"For the first time in more than 50 years, the US Food and Drug Administration has approved a drug specifically for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). This drug, belimumab (Benlysta), is a human monoclonal antibody that neutralizes the B-cell survival factor, B-lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS). The approval of belimumab combined a pioneering approach to genomics-based gene discovery, an astute appreciation of translational medicine, a disciplined clinical strategy, a willingness to take calculated risks, a devoted cadre of patients and physicians and a healthy dose of serendipity. Collectively, these efforts have provided a model for the development of a new generation of drugs to treat the broad manifestations of SLE. However, as a substantial percentage of SLE patients do not respond to belimumab, further research is needed to better characterize the pathogenetic mechanisms of SLE, identify additional therapeutic targets, and develop effective and nontoxic novel agents against these targets."
https://openalex.org/W1989186343,"A considerable need exists for improved biomarkers for differential diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring of therapeutic interventions for mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS), inherited metabolic disorders that involve lysosomal storage of glycosaminoglycans. Here we report a simple, reliable method based on the detection of abundant nonreducing ends of the glycosaminoglycans that accumulate in cells, blood and urine of individuals with MPS. In this method, glycosaminoglycans are enzymatically depolymerized, releasing unique mono-, di- or trisaccharides from the nonreducing ends of the chains. The composition of the released mono- and oligosaccharides depends on the nature of the lysosomal enzyme deficiency, and therefore they serve as diagnostic biomarkers. Analysis by LC/MS allowed qualitative and quantitative assessment of the biomarkers in biological samples. We provide a simple conceptual scheme for diagnosing MPS in uncharacterized samples and a method to monitor efficacy of enzyme replacement therapy or other forms of treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2036505189,"Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and activation of the unfolded protein response inhibits de novo protein translation and activates CHOP. However, the long-term induction of these pathways in response to prolonged ER stress would be detrimental. Tabas and colleagues now reveal a mechanism through which Toll-like receptor signalling suppresses CHOP activation and promotes protein translation, thus allowing cells to adapt to persistent ER stress. Activation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) induces the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) unfolded protein response (UPR) to accommodate essential protein translation1,2. However, despite increased levels of phosphorylated eIF2α (p-eIF2α), a TLR–TRIF-dependent pathway assures that the cells avoid CHOP induction, apoptosis and translational suppression of critical proteins3. As p-eIF2α decreases the functional interaction of eIF2 with eIF2B, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), we explored the hypothesis that TLR–TRIF signalling activates eIF2B GEF activity to counteract the effects of p-eIF2α. We now show that TLR–TRIF signalling activates eIF2B GEF through PP2A-mediated serine dephosphorylation of the eIF2B ɛ-subunit. PP2A itself is activated by decreased Src-family-kinase-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of its catalytic subunit. Each of these processes is required for TLR–TRIF-mediated CHOP suppression in ER-stressed cells in vitro and in vivo. Thus, in the setting of prolonged, physiologic ER stress, a unique TLR–TRIF-dependent translational control pathway enables cells to carry out essential protein synthesis and avoid CHOP-induced apoptosis while still benefiting from the protective arms of the UPR."
https://openalex.org/W2066956170,"Our previous work has shown that the membrane microdomain-associated flotillin proteins are potentially involved in epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor signaling. Here we show that knockdown of flotillin-1/reggie-2 results in reduced EGF-induced phosphorylation of specific tyrosines in the EGF receptor (EGFR) and in inefficient activation of the downstream mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and Akt signaling. Although flotillin-1 has been implicated in endocytosis, its depletion affects neither the endocytosis nor the ubiquitination of the EGFR. However, EGF-induced clustering of EGFR at the cell surface is altered in cells lacking flotillin-1. Furthermore, we show that flotillins form molecular complexes with EGFR in an EGF/EGFR kinase-independent manner. However, knockdown of flotillin-1 appears to affect the activation of the downstream MAP kinase signaling more directly. We here show that flotillin-1 forms a complex with CRAF, MEK1, ERK, and KSR1 (kinase suppressor of RAS) and that flotillin-1 knockdown leads to a direct inactivation of ERK1/2. Thus, flotillin-1 plays a direct role during both the early phase (activation of the receptor) and late (activation of MAP kinases) phase of growth factor signaling. Our results here unveil a novel role for flotillin-1 as a scaffolding factor in the regulation of classical MAP kinase signaling. Furthermore, our results imply that other receptor-tyrosine kinases may also rely on flotillin-1 upon activation, thus suggesting a general role for flotillin-1 as a novel factor in receptor-tyrosine kinase/MAP kinase signaling. Our previous work has shown that the membrane microdomain-associated flotillin proteins are potentially involved in epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor signaling.

Ligand binding results in dimerization and activation of the EGFR. Within the dimerized EGFR, several Tyr residues are autophosphorylated in trans, whereas others can be phosphorylated e.g. by Src kinases. These events result in recruitment of signaling partners of EGFR and activation of downstream signaling pathways, especially the MAP kinase pathway. In addition, the activated EGFR is ubiquitinated by Cbl, facilitating EGFR endocytosis and degradation in lysosomes (1.Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Zamir E. Kam Z. Oved S. Langdon W.Y. Beguinot L.

We have shown that flot-2 becomes Tyr-phosphorylated by Src kinase upon EGFR activation (18.Neumann-Giesen C. Fernow I. Amaddii M. Tikkanen R. Role of EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of reggie-1/flotillin-2 in cell spreading and signaling to the actin cytoskeleton.J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 395-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In addition, EGF stimulation results in uptake of flotillins from the plasma membrane into late endosomes (18.Neumann-Giesen C. Fernow I. Amaddii M. Tikkanen R.

In fact, the major pool of cellular flotillins appears to be bound in hetero-oligomers (27.Frick M. Bright N.A. Riento K. Bray A. Merrified C. Nichols B.J.

Biol. 2007; 17: 1151-1156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Upon EGF stimulation, these oligomers coalesce together, forming larger oligomers, which is likely to result in immobilization and subsequent endocytosis of flotillins (26.Babuke T. Ruonala M.

Endocytosis of flotillin-1 and flotillin-2 is regulated by Fyn kinase.J. Cell Sci. 2009; 122: 912-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Previous findings have suggested that flotillins are modified by EGFR signaling. This study was carried out to see how the depletion of flotillins affects the activation and endocytosis of the EGFR and the downstream signaling to MAP kinases. Rabbit polyclonal antibody against EGFR and antibodies against phospho-EGFR (Tyr(P)-1068 and Tyr(P)-1173), Akt, phospho-Akt (Ser-473), phospho-CRAF (Ser-338), MEK1/2, and phospho-MEK and phospho-Tyr were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). Rabbit polyclonal antibody against extracellularly regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), CRAF, and growth factor receptor-associated protein 2 (Grb2) and mouse monoclonal antibodies against EGFR, ubiquitin, and pERK1/2 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). A mouse monoclonal antibody against glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was obtained from Biozol (Eching, Germany). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against flot-1 and flot-2 were purchased from Sigma. For detection of flot-1 and flot-2 in Western blots, monoclonal antibodies from Transduction Laboratories were used. Rabbit monoclonal antibody against KSR1 was purchased from Millipore. The primary antibodies used for immunofluorescence were detected with a Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) and with an Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-rabbit antibody (Molecular Probes, Karlsruhe, Germany). Constitutive activation of CRAF with two Asp substitutions (RAF-DD; pCDNA3-FLAG-CRAF-Y340DY341D) has been described earlier (29.Marais R. Light Y. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Ras recruits Raf-1 to the plasma membrane for activation by tyrosine phosphorylation.EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3136-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Rat flotillin-1 coding region was cloned into pET-41a vector (Novagen/Merck), whereas the coding regions of human MEK1 and rat ERK2 were cloned into pGEX-4T-1 (GE Healthcare). Human CRAF-GST in pGEX-2T was a kind gift of Ulf Rapp. HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) with high glucose and 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Sigma) at 8% CO2 and 37 °C. Knockdown of flot-1 was performed as described previously (26.Babuke T. Ruonala M. Meister M. Amaddii M. Genzler C. Esposito A. Tikkanen R. Hetero-oligomerization of reggie-1/flotillin-2 and reggie-2/flotillin-1 is required for their endocytosis.Cell. Signal. 2009; 21: 1287-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) using the StealthTM siRNA system (Invitrogen). As a control, an oligo which does not target any human sequence (StealthTM RNAi Negative Control, medium GC content) was used. The cells were used for the assays 3 days post-transfection. Stable HeLa cells depleted of KSR1 were produced using lentiviral infection with Mission shRNA (Sigma) viruses. Control cells were infected with a virus carrying an shRNA that does not recognize any human sequence. Infected cells were selected in the growth medium containing puromycin, and depletion of KSR1 was verified by Western blot. HeLa cells were serum-starved for 16 h before treatment with 100 or 10 ng/ml EGF (Sigma). In some experiments the cells were treated for 10 min with 25 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF; Peprotech, Germany) or 50 ng/ml phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) for 20 min. The PathDetect® pSRE-Luc Cis-Reporter Plasmid and the pRL-SV40 control vector were from Stratagene (Waldbronn, Germany) and Promega (Mannheim, Germany). 24 h after siRNA knockdown, each well of a 12-well plate was transfected with 500 ng of pSRE-Luc and 7.5 ng pRL-SV40 using Lipofectamine 2000 and after 6 h transferred onto 24-well plates. The cells were serum-starved for 16 h, treated with 10 or 100 ng/ml EGF for 8 h, and harvested in lysis buffer. Luciferase assays were performed in triplicate using the Dual Luciferase® Reporter Assay System (Promega). The activity of firefly luciferase was normalized to renilla luciferase activity. HeLa cells grown on coverslips were treated with EGF for the indicated times after starvation and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde or methanol. Permeabilization after paraformaldehyde fixation was carried out with digitonin (50 μg/ml). The cells were labeled with primary antibodies and Cy3 and/or Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibodies and then embedded in Gelmount (Biomeda, Foster City, CA) supplemented with 50 mg/ml 1,4-diazadicyclo(2,2,2)octane (Fluka, Neu-Ulm, Germany). The specimens were examined using a Zeiss LSM510 Meta confocal laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). HeLa cells transfected with siRNA oligos were starved overnight on coverslips. The cells were either stimulated for 2 min with 100 ng/ml EGF or not, fixed, and labeled with an anti-EGFR antibody (1:100, Santa Cruz) and subsequently with a Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody. Coverslips were stored in PBS until TIRF microscopy was performed using an Olympus BX50 microscope with a 561-nm diode laser line and an MT-20 illumination system. Images were acquired with the Cell̂R Software (Olympus) and analyzed with Image J Software (National Institutes of Health). The cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Sigma) and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate (for bFGF treatment) on ice for 30 min. Protein concentrations were determined, and equal protein amounts were analyzed by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot. Alternatively, the cell pellets were lysed directly in 1× SDS-PAGE loading buffer supplemented with 5% β-mercaptoethanol and 25 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) followed by a brief sonication. For internalization assays, control and flotillin-1 knockdown (F1-KD) HeLa cells grown on 24-well plates (100,000 cells/well, triplicates) were starved for 18 h. The cells were stimulated with 1.5 ng/ml 125I-EGF (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in a binding buffer (DMEM medium, 0.1% BSA, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) for 2, 4, and 6 min at 37 °C. Surface-bound EGF was removed with an acid wash solution (0.2 m acetic acid, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 2.5). Internalized EGF was extracted by lysing the cells in 1 m NaOH. Radioactivity of surface-bound EGF fractions and internalized EGF fractions was measured in a gamma counter (Wallac 1480 Wizard). The ratio of internalized to surface-bound EGF was plotted against the time. The endocytic rate constant Ke (30.Wiley H.S. Cunningham D.D. The endocytotic rate constant. A cellular parameter for quantitating receptor-mediated endocytosis.J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4222-4229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was determined as the slope of the trendline. Cells previously transfected with siRNA oligos were lysed as described above. Unspecific binding material was removed with 50 μl of Pansorbin beads (Calbiochem). The lysates were incubated for 16 h at 4 °C with 30 μl of magnetic Dynabeads Protein G (Invitrogen) coupled with 1.6 μg of mouse anti-EGFR antibody. The beads were washed with 1 ml each of Neufeld buffer (10 mm Tris, 600 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.05% Nonidet P40, pH 8.5), immunomix (IMM) buffer (1% Triton X-100 and 0.5% sodium desoxycholate in PBS), IMM with 2 m KCl, and 0.1× PBS. The precipitated proteins were solubilized into 1× SDS sample buffer containing 25 mm DTT by boiling and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. In most cases, 10% SDS-PAGE gels were used. For the analysis of EGFR ubiquitination, 4–12% NuPage (Invitrogen) Bis-Tris gradient gels were used. HeLa cells were either starved or kept in serum-containing medium. Starved cells were then either stimulated with 100 ng/ml EGF for 5 or 15 min or left untreated and lysed in co-immunoprecipitation buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm vanadate, 5 mm NaF, 60 mm n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (AppliChem) and protease inhibitor mixture. In some experiments the cells were treated with an EGFR kinase inhibitor PD153035, a non-inhibiting control compound AG9 (both at 20 nm; Calbiochem) or DMSO for 5 min before EGF stimulation. Antibodies against flot-1, flot-2 (rabbit, Sigma), or myc (rabbit, Santa Cruz) for control were coupled on Protein A Dynabeads (Invitrogen). The lysates and beads were rolled overnight at 4 °C, and the beads were then washed 3 times in 1 ml of co-immunoprecipitation buffer. The beads and aliquots of lysates (=input) were supplemented with SDS-PAGE loading buffer and cooked for 5 min at 94 °C. Bacterial expression vectors encoding for flotillin-1-GST, CRAF-GST, ERK2-GST, MEK1-GST, or GST were transformed into a bacterial expression strain, grown in a liquid culture at 37 °C to reach A600 0.4–0.6. Bacteria transformed with GST were then induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG) for 5 h at 37 °C, whereas those transformed with the other GST fusions were induced with 50–300 μm IPTG overnight at 19 °C. The cells were pelleted and lysed in GST lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with 100 μg/ml lysozyme, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm protease inhibitors (aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin). The GST proteins were bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare). For the direct pulldown assays with GST-RAF, -MEK1, or -ERK2, flot-1-GST was cleaved with thrombin to remove the GST tag. Cleavage was performed with 20 μg of purified flot-1-GST bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads. The beads were first washed 3 times with cleavage buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 0.15 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2) freshly supplemented with 1 mm DTT. The reaction was carried out using 1 unit of thrombin in 200 μl of the cleavage buffer overnight at 19 °C. The next day thrombin was inactivated with 1 mm PMSF, and the GST-bound beads were removed by centrifugation. The supernatant containing flot-1 was used for pulldown assays. HeLa cells were lysed in lysis buffer for GST pulldown (100 mm Tris pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100) supplemented with Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Sigma) and 60 mm n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside. The cell lysate was incubated overnight at 4 °C with either GST or flotillin-1-GST immobilized on the beads. The beads were washed 3 times with 1 ml of lysis buffer. The samples were then prepared for SDS-PAGE. Direct GST pulldown experiments were performed on ice for 3 h with 5 μg of each of the purified proteins (GST, CRAF-GST, MEK1-GST, ERK2-GST, and Flot1). The beads were washed 3 times with washing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.01% Triton X-100), resuspended in 2× SDS sample buffer containing 50 mm DTT, boiled for 5 min at 94 °C, and separated by SDS-PAGE. After knocking down flot-1 with siRNA, cells were transferred in 15-cm dishes for 48 h. Thereafter, they were starved overnight and treated or not with EGF (100 ng/ml) for 30 min on ice. Lipid rafts were prepared according to Macdonald and Pike (31.Macdonald J.L. Pike L.J. A simplified method for the preparation of detergent-free lipid rafts.J. Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 1061-1067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), with a modification (sonication step included after mechanical homogenization to facilitate proper membrane shearing). After collecting the fractions, 400 μl of each fraction were precipitated with acetone, and the pellet was resuspended in 70 μl of 2× loading buffer containing 50 mm DTT. Equal volumes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. For the detection of the ganglioside GM1, 5 μl of the fractions were slot-blotted onto nitrocellulose and incubated with 0.5 μg/ml cholera toxin subunit B (Invitrogen) conjugated with HRP. Total RNA was isolated using peqGold Trifast (Peqlab, Erlangen, Germany). RNA (3 μg) was reverse-transcribed with 150 fmol of oligo(dT)15 primers and 180 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) in a total volume of 45 μl. Real time PCRs (iQ™5 QPCR System, Bio-Rad) were performed in triplicate with 1 μl of 5-fold diluted cDNA in 25-μl reaction mixtures using Absolute QPCR SYBR Green Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bonn, Germany). The annealing temperature was 60 °C for all PCR reactions. Primers were designed to be specific for cDNA with PerlPrimer. Primer sequences were: cyclin D1 forward, 5′-TCGTGGCCTCTAAGATGAAGGA-3′; cyclin D1 reverse, 5′-CAGCTCCATTTGCAGCAGCTC-3′; Rpl13a forward, 5′-CCTGGAGGAGAAGAGGAAAGAGA-3′; Rpl13a reverse, 5′-TTGAGGACCTCTGTGTATTTGTCAA-3′; GAPDH forward, 5′-CATCTTCCAGGAGCGAGATCCC-3′; GAPDH reverse, 5′-CCAGCCTTCTCCATGGTGGT-3′. PCR products were quantified with a standard curve. The mean of the reference genes Rpl13a and GAPDH was used for normalization. Unless otherwise stated, all experiments were performed at least three times. For the statistical analysis, Western blot bands of phosphorylated proteins were quantified by scanning densitometry using Quantity One Software (Bio-Rad) and normalized against the total amount of the respective protein. Data are shown as the mean ± S.D. Statistical comparisons between groups were made using Student's t tests or 2-way analysis of variance as appropriate using GraphPad Prism 4 software. Values of p < 0.05 were considered significant (*), whereas values of p < 0.01 and p < 0.001 were defined very significant (**) and highly significant (***), respectively. The images shown have in some cases as a whole been subjected to contrast or brightness adjustments. No other manipulations have been performed unless otherwise stated. We have previously shown that flotillins get phosphorylated and endocytosed upon EGFR signaling (9.Neumann-Giesen C. Falkenbach B. Beicht P. Claasen S. Lüers G. Stuermer C.A. Herzog V. Tikkanen R.

https://openalex.org/W2148457490,"This study demonstrates that visual crowding (the inability to identify objects in clutter) develops as a result of interactions between peripheral attention and saccade-induced image displacements. The authors suggest that this offers a much more generalized explanation for the phenomenon of visual crowding. Processing of shape information in human peripheral visual fields is impeded beyond what can be expected by poor spatial resolution. Visual crowding, the inability to identify objects in clutter, has been shown to be the primary factor limiting shape perception in peripheral vision. Despite the well-documented effects of crowding, its underlying causes remain poorly understood. Given that spatial attention both facilitates learning of image statistics and directs saccadic eye movements, we propose that the acquisition of image statistics in peripheral visual fields is confounded by eye-movement artifacts. Specifically, the image statistics acquired under a peripherally deployed spotlight of attention are systematically biased by saccade-induced image displacements. These erroneously represented image statistics lead to inappropriate contextual interactions in the periphery and cause crowding."
https://openalex.org/W1988036883,"The KCNH family of ion channels, comprising ether-à-go-go (EAG), EAG-related gene (ERG), and EAG-like (ELK) K(+)-channel subfamilies, is crucial for repolarization of the cardiac action potential, regulation of neuronal excitability and proliferation of tumour cells. The carboxy-terminal region of KCNH channels contains a cyclic-nucleotide-binding homology domain (CNBHD) and C-linker that couples the CNBHD to the pore. The C-linker/CNBHD is essential for proper function and trafficking of ion channels in the KCNH family. However, despite the importance of the C-linker/CNBHD for the function of KCNH channels, the structural basis of ion-channel regulation by the C-linker/CNBHD is unknown. Here we report the crystal structure of the C-linker/CNBHD of zebrafish ELK channels at 2.2-Å resolution. Although the overall structure of the C-linker/CNBHD of ELK channels is similar to the cyclic-nucleotide-binding domain (CNBD) structure of the related hyperpolarization-activated cyclic-nucleotide-modulated (HCN) channels, there are marked differences. Unlike the CNBD of HCN, the CNBHD of ELK displays a negatively charged electrostatic profile that explains the lack of binding and regulation of KCNH channels by cyclic nucleotides. Instead of cyclic nucleotide, the binding pocket is occupied by a short β-strand. Mutations of the β-strand shift the voltage dependence of activation to more depolarized voltages, implicating the β-strand as an intrinsic ligand for the CNBHD of ELK channels. In both ELK and HCN channels the C-linker is the site of virtually all of the intersubunit interactions in the C-terminal region. However, in the zebrafish ELK structure there is a reorientation in the C-linker so that the subunits form dimers instead of tetramers, as observed in HCN channels. These results provide a structural framework for understanding the regulation of ion channels in the KCNH family by the C-linker/CNBHD and may guide the design of specific drugs."

https://openalex.org/W2084866368,"Mice with a knock-in mutation (Y524S) in the type I ryanodine receptor (Ryr1), a mutation analogous to the Y522S mutation that is associated with malignant hyperthermia in humans, die when exposed to short periods of temperature elevation (≥37 °C). We show here that treatment with 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside (AICAR) prevents this heat-induced sudden death in this mouse model. The protection by AICAR is independent of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation and results from a newly identified action of the compound on mutant Ryr1 to reduce Ca(2+) leak from the sarcoplasmic reticulum to the sarcoplasm. AICAR thus prevents Ca(2+)-dependent increases in the amount of both reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) that act to further increase resting Ca(2+) concentrations. If unchecked, the temperature-driven increases in resting Ca(2+) concentrations and the amounts of ROS and RNS create an amplifying cycle that ultimately triggers sustained muscle contractions, rhabdomyolysis and death. Although antioxidants are effective in reducing this cycle in vitro, only AICAR prevents heat-induced death in vivo. Our findings suggest that AICAR is probably effective in prophylactic treatment of humans with enhanced susceptibility to exercise- and/or heat-induced sudden death associated with RYR1 mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2067594036,"Estrogen effects on mammary epithelial and breast cancer (BC) cells are mediated by the nuclear receptors ERα and ERβ, transcription factors that display functional antagonism with each other, with ERβ acting as oncosuppressor and interfering with the effects of ERα on cell proliferation, tumor promotion and progression. Indeed, hormone-responsive, ERα+ BC cells often lack ERβ, which when present associates with a less aggressive clinical phenotype of the disease. Recent evidences point to a significant role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in BC, where specific miRNA expression profiles associate with distinct clinical and biological phenotypes of the lesion. Considering the possibility that ERβ might influence BC cell behavior via miRNAs, we compared miRNome expression in ERβ+ vs ERβ− hormone-responsive BC cells and found a widespread effect of this ER subtype on the expression pattern of these non-coding RNAs. More importantly, the expression pattern of 67 miRNAs, including 10 regulated by ERβ in BC cells, clearly distinguishes ERβ+, node-negative, from ERβ−, metastatic, mammary tumors. Molecular dissection of miRNA biogenesis revealed multiple mechanisms for direct regulation of this process by ERβ+ in BC cell nuclei. In particular, ERβ downregulates miR-30a by binding to two specific sites proximal to the gene and thereby inhibiting pri-miR synthesis. On the other hand, the receptor promotes miR-23b, -27b and 24-1 accumulation in the cell by binding in close proximity of the corresponding gene cluster and preventing in situ the inhibitory effects of ERα on pri-miR maturation by the p68/DDX5-Drosha microprocessor complex. These results indicate that cell autonomous regulation of miRNA expression is part of the mechanism of action of ERβ in BC cells and could contribute to establishment or maintenance of a less aggressive tumor phenotype mediated by this nuclear receptor."

https://openalex.org/W2092171405,"In this study, the authors show that NAB-1 acts during synaptogenesis to link the F-actin network and the active zone proteins SYD-1 and SYD-2, thereby promoting presynapse assembly in Caenorhabditis elegans. During synaptogenesis, macromolecular protein complexes assemble at the pre- and postsynaptic membrane. Extensive literature identifies many transmembrane molecules sufficient to induce synapse formation and several intracellular scaffolding molecules responsible for assembling active zones and recruiting synaptic vesicles. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms coupling membrane receptors to active zone molecules during development. Using Caenorhabditis elegans, we identify an F-actin network present at nascent presynaptic terminals and required for presynaptic assembly. We unravel a sequence of events whereby specificity-determining adhesion molecules define the location of developing synapses and locally assemble F-actin. Next, the adaptor protein NAB-1 (neurabin) binds to F-actin and recruits active zone proteins SYD-1 and SYD-2 (liprin-α) by forming a tripartite complex. NAB-1 localizes transiently to synapses during development and is required for presynaptic assembly. Altogether, we identify a role for the actin cytoskeleton during presynaptic development and characterize a molecular pathway whereby NAB-1 links synaptic partner recognition to active zone assembly."
https://openalex.org/W2049839607,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs of ∼20 nt in length that are capable of modulating gene expression post-transcriptionally. Although miRNAs have been implicated in cancer, including breast cancer, the regulation of miRNA transcription and the role of defects in this process in cancer is not well understood. In this study we have mapped the promoters of 93 breast cancer-associated miRNAs, and then looked for associations between DNA methylation of 15 of these promoters and miRNA expression in breast cancer cells. The miRNA promoters with clearest association between DNA methylation and expression included a previously described and a novel promoter of the Hsa-mir-200b cluster. The novel promoter of the Hsa-mir-200b cluster, denoted P2, is located ∼2 kb upstream of the 5′ stemloop and maps within a CpG island. P2 has comparable promoter activity to the previously reported promoter (P1), and is able to drive the expression of miR-200b in its endogenous genomic context. DNA methylation of both P1 and P2 was inversely associated with miR-200b expression in eight out of nine breast cancer cell lines, and in vitro methylation of both promoters repressed their activity in reporter assays. In clinical samples, P1 and P2 were differentially methylated with methylation inversely associated with miR-200b expression. P1 was hypermethylated in metastatic lymph nodes compared with matched primary breast tumours whereas P2 hypermethylation was associated with loss of either oestrogen receptor or progesterone receptor.

https://openalex.org/W2078186578,"Many enzymes that react with specific sites in DNA have the property of facilitated diffusion, in which the DNA chain is used as a conduit to accelerate site location. Despite the importance of such mechanisms in gene regulation and DNA repair, there have been few viable approaches to elucidate the microscopic process of facilitated diffusion. Here we describe a new method in which a small-molecule trap (uracil) is used to clock a DNA repair enzyme as it hops and slides between damaged sites in DNA. The 'molecular clock' provides unprecedented information: the mean length for DNA sliding, the one-dimensional diffusion constant, the maximum hopping radius and the time frame for DNA hopping events. In addition, the data establish that the DNA phosphate backbone is a sufficient requirement for DNA sliding."

The functional human 5-HT1A C(−1019)G promoter polymorphism (rs6295), which prevents the binding of Deaf-1/NUDR leading to dysregulation of the receptor, has been associated with major depression. In cell models Deaf-1 displays dual activity, repressing 5-HT1A autoreceptor expression in serotonergic raphe cells while enhancing postsynaptic 5-HT1A heteroreceptor expression in nonserotonergic neurons. A functional Deaf-1 binding site on the mouse 5-HT1A promoter was recognized by Deaf-1 in vitro and in vivo and mediated dual activity of Deaf-1 on 5-HT1A gene transcription. To address regulation by Deaf-1 in vivo, Deaf-1 knock-out mice bred to a C57BL/6 background were compared with wild-type siblings for changes in 5-HT1A RNA and protein by quantitative RT-PCR, in situ hybridization, and immunofluorescence. In the dorsal raphe, Deaf-1 knock-out mice displayed increased 5-HT1A mRNA, protein, and 5-HT1A-positive cell counts but reduced 5-HT levels, whereas other serotonergic markers, such as tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH)- or 5-HT-positive cells and TPH2 RNA levels, were unchanged. By contrast, 5-HT1A mRNA and 5-HT1A-positive cells were reduced in the frontal cortex of Deaf-1-null mice, with no significant change in hippocampal 5-HT1A RNA, protein, or cell counts. The region-specific alterations of brain 5-HT1A gene expression and reduced raphe 5-HT content in Deaf-1−/− mice indicate the importance of Deaf-1 in regulation of 5-HT1A gene expression and provide insight into the role of the 5-HT1A G(−1019) allele in reducing serotonergic neurotransmission by derepression of 5-HT1A autoreceptors.

https://openalex.org/W1988175852,"Body fat, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes are often linked together, but the molecular mechanisms that unify their association are poorly understood. Wnt signaling regulates adipogenesis, and its altered activity has been implicated in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. LRP6(+/-) mice on a high fat diet were protected against diet-induced obesity and hepatic and adipose tissue insulin resistance compared with their wild-type (WT) littermates. Brown adipose tissue insulin sensitivity and reduced adiposity of LRP6(+/-) mice were accounted for by diminished Wnt-dependent mTORC1 activity and enhanced expression of brown adipose tissue PGC1-α and UCP1. LRP6(+/-) mice also exhibited reduced endogenous hepatic glucose output, which was due to diminished FoxO1-dependent expression of the key gluconeogenic enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase (G6pase). In addition, in vivo and in vitro studies showed that loss of LRP6 allele is associated with increased leptin receptor expression, which is a likely cause of hepatic insulin sensitivity in LRP6(+/-) mice. Our study identifies LRP6 as a nutrient-sensitive regulator of body weight and glucose metabolism and as a potential target for pharmacological interventions in obesity and diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W1997014592,"The Snail family of transcription factors has been implicated in pancreatic cancer progression. We recently showed that Snail (Snai1) promotes membrane-type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP)- and ERK1/2-dependent scattering of pancreatic cancer cells in three-dimensional type I collagen. In this study, we examine the role of Slug (Snai2) in regulating pancreatic cancer cell scattering in three-dimensional type I collagen. Although Slug increased MT1-MMP expression and ERK1/2 activity, Slug-expressing cells failed to scatter in three-dimensional collagen. Moreover, in contrast to Snail-expressing cells, Slug-expressing cells did not demonstrate increased collagen I binding, collagen I-driven motility, or α2β1-integrin expression. Significantly, inhibiting β1-integrin function decreased migration and scattering of Snail-expressing cells in three-dimensional collagen. As Rho GTPases have been implicated in invasion and migration, we also analyzed the contribution of Rac1 and Rho signaling to the differential migration and scattering of pancreatic cancer cells. Snail-induced migration and scattering were attenuated by Rac1 inhibition. In contrast, inhibiting Rho-associated kinase ROCK1/2 increased migration and scattering of Slug-expressing cells in three-dimensional collagen and thus phenocopied the effects of Snail in pancreatic cancer cells. Additionally, the increased migration and scattering in three-dimensional collagen of Slug-expressing cells following ROCK1/2 inhibition was dependent on β1-integrin function. Overall, these results demonstrate differential effects of Snail and Slug in pancreatic cancer and identify the interplay between Rho signaling and β1-integrin that functions to regulate the differential scattering and migration of Snail- and Slug-expressing pancreatic cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2024858047,"Transactive response DNA-binding protein (TARDBP/TDP-43), a heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) with diverse activities, is a common denominator in several neurodegenerative disorders, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Orthologs of TDP-43 exist in animals ranging from mammals to invertebrates. Here, we systematically studied mutant Caenorhabditis elegans lacking the nematode TDP-43 ortholog, TDP-1. Heterologous expression of human TDP-43 rescued the defects in C. elegans lacking TDP-1, suggesting their functions are conserved. Although the tdp-1 mutants exhibited deficits in fertility, growth, and locomotion, loss of tdp-1 attenuated defects in several C. elegans models of proteotoxicity. Loss of tdp-1 suppressed defects in transgenic C. elegans expressing TDP-43 or CuZn superoxide dismutase, both of which are associated with proteotoxicity in neurodegenerative diseases. Loss of tdp-1 also reduced defects in mutant animals lacking the heat shock factor HSF-1. Transcriptional profiling demonstrated that the loss of TDP-1 altered expression of genes functioning in RNA processing and protein folding. Furthermore, the absence of tdp-1 extended the life span in C. elegans. The life span extension required a FOXO transcriptional factor DAF-16 but not HSF-1. These results suggest that the C. elegans TDP-1 has a role in the regulation of protein homeostasis and aging."
https://openalex.org/W2100853994,"Heterotrimeric G proteins, consisting of Gα, Gβ, and Gγ subunits, play important roles in plant development and cell signaling. In Arabidopsis, in addition to one prototypical G protein α subunit, GPA1, there are three extra-large G proteins, XLG1, XLG2, and XLG3, of largely unknown function. Each extra-large G (XLG) protein has a C-terminal Gα-like region and a ∼400 amino acid N-terminal extension. Here we show that the three XLG proteins specifically bind and hydrolyze GTP, despite the fact that these plant-specific proteins lack key conserved amino acid residues important for GTP binding and hydrolysis of GTP in mammalian Gα proteins. Moreover, unlike other known Gα proteins, these activities require Ca(2+) instead of Mg(2+) as a cofactor. Yeast two-hybrid library screening and in vitro protein pull-down assays revealed that XLG2 interacts with the nuclear protein RTV1 (related to vernalization 1). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays show that RTV1 binds to DNA in vitro in a non-sequence-specific manner and that GTP-bound XLG2 promotes the DNA binding activity of RTV1. Overexpression of RTV1 results in early flowering. Combined overexpression of XLG2 and RTV1 enhances this early flowering phenotype and elevates expression of the floral pathway integrator genes, FT and SOC1, but does not repress expression of the floral repressor, FLC. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays show that XLG2 increases RTV1 binding to FT and SOC1 promoters. Thus, a Ca(2+)-dependent G protein, XLG2, promotes RTV1 DNA binding activity for a subset of floral integrator genes and contributes to floral transition."
https://openalex.org/W2003938320,"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mediated cell signaling is critical for mammary epithelial cell growth and survival; however, targeting EGFR has shown no or only minimal therapeutic benefit in patients with breast cancer. Here, we report a novel regulatory mechanism of EGFR signaling that may explain the low response rates. We found that breast tumor kinase (Brk)/protein-tyrosine kinase 6 (PTK6), a nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinase highly expressed in most human breast tumors, interacted with EGFR and sustained ligand-induced EGFR signaling. We demonstrate that Brk inhibits ligand-induced EGFR degradation through uncoupling activated EGFR from casitas B-lineage lymphoma-mediated EGFR ubiquitination. In addition, upon activation by EGFR, Brk directly phosphorylated Y845 in the EGFR kinase domain, thereby further potentiating EGFR kinase activity. Experimental elevation of Brk conferred resistance of breast cancer cells to cetuximab (an EGFR-blocking antibody)-induced inhibition of cell signaling and proliferation, whereas knockdown of Brk sensitized the cells to cetuximab by inducing apoptosis. Our findings reveal a previously unknown role of Brk in EGFR-targeted therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2035019079,"Activation of Akt signaling pathway has been suggested involving in chemoresistance, metastasis and tumorigenesis of gastric cancer. However, the mechanism of Akt regulation in gastric cancer is not fully understood. RUNX3, which was first identified as a transcription factor, suppresses gastric tumorigenesis through regulating expression of target genes. Here, we found that restoration of RUNX3 significantly downregulates the protein and mRNA expression of Akt1 in gastric cancer cell lines, AGS and SNU-1. Knockdown of RUNX3 upregulates protein and mRNA expression of Akt1 in normal gastric epithelial cell line, GES-1. The negative correlation of RUNX3 and Akt expression and downstream β-catenin/cyclin D1 effectors was further confirmed in AGS and GES-1 cell lines, as well as clinical specimens of gastric cancer. We identified two RUNX3-binding sites in Akt1 promoter and the binding of RUNX3 on Akt1 promoter significantly inhibits Akt1 expression. The RUNX3-mediated inhibition of Akt1 caused β-catenin protein degradation and then cyclin D1 downregulation. Restoration of cyclin D1 reverses cell growth inhibition and G1 phase arrest induced by RUNX3 in gastric cancer cells. Our results show that loss of RUNX3 expression can enhance the Akt1-mediated signaling pathway and promote the tumorigenesis process in human gastric cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2093626739,"Galectin-3 is a chimeric carbohydrate-binding protein, which interacts with cell surface carbohydrate-containing molecules and extracellular matrix glycoproteins and has been implicated in various biological processes such as cell growth, angiogenesis, motility, and metastasis. It is expressed in a wide range of tumor cells and is associated with tumor progression. The functions of galectin-3 are dependent on its localization and post-translational modifications such as cleavage and phosphorylation. Recently, we showed that galectin-3 Tyr-107 is phosphorylated by c-Abl; concomitantly, it was also shown that galectin-3 can be cleaved at this site by prostate-specific antigen (PSA), a chymotrypsin-like serine protease, after Tyr-107, resulting in loss of galectin-3 multivalency while preserving its carbohydrate binding activity. Galectin-3 is largely a monomer in solution but may form a homodimer by self-association through its carbohydrate recognition domain, whereas, in the presence of a ligand, galectin-3 polymerizes up to pentamers utilizing its N-terminal domain. Oligomerization is a unique feature of secreted galectin-3, which allows its function by forming ordered galectin-glycan structures, i.e. lattices, on the cell surface or through direct engagement of specific cell surface glycoconjugates by traditional ligand-receptor binding. We questioned whether Tyr-107 phosphorylation by c-Abl affects galectin-3 cleavage by PSA. The data suggest a role for galectin-3 in prostate cells associated with increased activity of c-Abl kinase and loss of phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) activity. In addition, the ratio of phosphorylated/dephosphorylated galectin-3 might be used as a complementary value to that of PSA for prognosis of prostate cancer and a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2044536765,"Chk1 both arrests replication forks and enhances repair of DNA damage by phosphorylating downstream effectors. Although there has been a concerted effort to identify effectors of Chk1 activity, underlying mechanisms of effector action are still being identified. Metnase (also called SETMAR) is a SET and transposase domain protein that promotes both DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair and restart of stalled replication forks. In this study, we show that Metnase is phosphorylated only on Ser495 (S495) in vivo in response to DNA damage by ionizing radiation. Chk1 is the major mediator of this phosphorylation event. We had previously shown that wild-type (wt) Metnase associates with chromatin near DSBs and methylates histone H3 Lys36. Here we show that a Ser495Ala (S495A) Metnase mutant, which is not phosphorylated by Chk1, is defective in DSB-induced chromatin association. The S495A mutant also fails to enhance repair of an induced DSB when compared with wt Metnase. Interestingly, the S495A mutant demonstrated increased restart of stalled replication forks compared with wt Metnase. Thus, phosphorylation of Metnase S495 differentiates between these two functions, enhancing DSB repair and repressing replication fork restart. In summary, these data lend insight into the mechanism by which Chk1 enhances repair of DNA damage while at the same time repressing stalled replication fork restart."
https://openalex.org/W2075916891,"Receptor desensitization is a universal mechanism to turn off a biological response; in this process, the ability of a physiological trigger to activate a cell is lost despite the continued presence of the stimulus. Receptor desensitization of G-protein-coupled receptors involves uncoupling of the receptor from its G-protein or second-messenger pathway followed by receptor internalization. G-protein-coupled cysteinyl leukotriene type I (CysLT1) receptors regulate immune-cell function and CysLT1 receptors are an established therapeutic target for allergies, including asthma. Desensitization of CysLT1 receptors arises predominantly from protein-kinase-C-dependent phosphorylation of three serine residues in the receptor carboxy terminus. Physiological concentrations of the receptor agonist leukotriene C(4) (LTC(4)) evoke repetitive cytoplasmic Ca(2+) oscillations, reflecting regenerative Ca(2+) release from stores, which is sustained by Ca(2+) entry through store-operated calcium-release-activated calcium (CRAC) channels. CRAC channels are tightly linked to expression of the transcription factor c-fos, a regulator of numerous genes important to cell growth and development. Here we show that abolishing leukotriene receptor desensitization suppresses agonist-driven gene expression in a rat cell line. Mechanistically, stimulation of non-desensitizing receptors evoked prolonged inositol-trisphosphate-mediated Ca(2+) release, which led to accelerated Ca(2+)-dependent slow inactivation of CRAC channels and a subsequent loss of excitation-transcription coupling. Hence, rather than serving to turn off a biological response, reversible desensitization of a Ca(2+) mobilizing receptor acts as an 'on' switch, sustaining long-term signalling in the immune system."

PU.1 and Ikaros are pivotal factors whose expression and utilization are dynamically altered during hematopoietic development. Here, we demonstrate that expression of PU.1, encoded by the Sfpi1 gene, is divergently regulated by Ikaros in distinct cell type-specific contexts. Chromatin immune precipitation analysis and functional perturbations revealed that Ikaros can directly repress or activate Sfpi1 transcription via different PU.1 cis-elements, with PU.1 and Ikaros collaborating at myeloid-specific elements but not at other elements. Our results thus shed light on how PU.1 and Ikaros can act as lineage competency factors to facilitate both myeloid and lymphoid developmental programs."
https://openalex.org/W1971290779,"While Ras is well-known to function on the plasma membrane (PM) to mediate growth factor signaling, increasing evidence suggests that Ras has complex roles in the cytoplasm. To uncover these roles, we screened a cDNA library and isolated H-Ras-binding proteins that also influence Ras functions. Many isolated proteins regulate trafficking involving endosomes; CHMP6/VPS20 and VPS4A, which interact with ESCRT-III (Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport-III), were chosen for further study. We showed that the binding is direct and occurs in endosomes. Furthermore, the binding is most efficient when H-Ras has a functional effector-binding loop, and is GTP-bound and ubiquitylated. CHMP6 and VPS4A also bound to N-Ras but not K-Ras. Repressing CHMP6 and VPS4A blocked Ras-induced transformation, which correlated with inefficient Ras localization to the PM as measured by cell fractionation and photobleaching. Moreover, silencing CHMP6 and VPS4A also blocked epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) recycling. These data suggest that Ras interacts with key ESCRT-III components to promote recycling of itself and EGFR back to the PM to create a positive feedback loop to enhance growth factor signaling."

Four charged residues in the fifth cytoplasmic loop (CL5) connecting transmembrane helix 9 (TM9) to TM10 are critical for stable expression of MRP1 at the plasma membrane. Thus Ala substitution of Lys(513), Lys(516), Glu(521), and Glu(535) all cause misfolding of MRP1 and target the protein for proteasome-mediated degradation. Of four chemical chaperones tested, 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA) was the most effective at restoring expression of MRP1 mutants K513A, K516A, E521A, and E535A. However, although 4-PBA treatment of K513A resulted in wild-type protein levels (and activity), the same treatment had little or no effect on the expression of K516A. On the other hand, 4-PBA treatment allowed both E521A and E535A to exit the endoplasmic reticulum and be stably expressed at the plasma membrane. However, the 4-PBA-rescued E535A mutant exhibited decreased transport activity associated with reduced substrate affinity and conformational changes in both halves of the transporter. By contrast, E521A exhibited reduced transport activity associated with alterations in the mutant interactions with ATP as well as a distinct conformational change in the COOH-proximal half of MRP1. These findings illustrate the critical and complex role of CL5 for stable expression of MRP1 at the plasma membrane and more specifically show the differential importance of Glu(521) and Glu(535) in interdomain interactions required for proper folding and assembly of MRP1 into a fully transport competent native structure."

However, Gαq can also activate other signaling pathways independently of phospholipase Cβ stimulation. Gαq triggers the RhoA cascade, also required for a Gq-induced hypertrophic response through a direct interaction with p63RhoGEF (14.Chikumi H. Vázquez-Prado J. Servitja J.M. Miyazaki H. Gutkind J.S.

More recently, we have reported a novel role for Gαq as a scaffold protein capable of recruiting both PKCζ and the kinase MEK5 into an active complex, leading to the activation of the ERK5 pathway in epithelial cells (18.García-Hoz C. Sánchez-Fernández G. Díaz-Meco M.T. Moscat J. Mayor F. Ribas C. Gα(q) acts as an adaptor protein in protein kinase C ζ (PKCζ)-mediated ERK5 activation by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR).J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 13480-13489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). ERK5 is a member of the MAPK family that is activated by the upstream MEK5 kinase in response to different growth factors and cellular stressors (19.Obara Y. Nakahata N. The signaling pathway leading to extracellular signal-regulated kinase 5 (ERK5) activation via G-proteins and ERK5-dependent neurotrophic effects.Mol. Pharmacol. 2010; 77: 10-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Activation of Gαq is a potent inducer of MAPK signaling in cardiac myocytes. The complex role of ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 MAPK cascades in promoting compensated cardiac hypertrophy and/or transition to heart failure has been investigated extensively (1.Dorn 2nd, G.W. Force T. Protein kinase cascades in the regulation of cardiac hypertrophy.J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 527-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar, 12.Heineke J. Molkentin J.D. Regulation of cardiac hypertrophy by intracellular signaling pathways.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 589-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (1497) Google Scholar). Additionally, an important cardiac role for ERK5 has been identified recently (20.Wang X. Tournier C. Regulation of cellular functions by the ERK5 signaling pathway.Cell Signal. 2006; 18: 753-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Although genetic deletion of ERK5 or MEK5 has indicated a role for this pathway in angiogenesis, endothelial cell physiology, and cardiovascular development (21.Nishimoto S. Nishida E. MAPK signaling: ERK5 versus ERK1/2.EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 782-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 22.Roberts O.L. Holmes K. Müller J. Cross D.A. Cross M.J. ERK5 and the regulation of endothelial cell function.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2009; 37: 1254-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), recent data also point to a role of ERK5 in cardiac hypertrophy and cardiomyocyte survival (23.Nicol R.L. Frey N. Pearson G.

Res. 2010; 106: 961-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Notably, the transcription factors MEF2A/2C, well known downstream targets of ERK5, promote cardiac hypertrophy in transgenic mice (26.Xu J. Gong N.L. Bodi I. Aronow B.J. Backx P.H. Molkentin J.D. Myocyte enhancer factors 2A and 2C induce dilated cardiomyopathy in transgenic mice.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9152-9162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), whereas targeted deletion of this kinase attenuates the hypertrophic response mediated by MEF2 activation in vivo (25.Kimura T.E. Jin J. Zi M. Prehar S. Liu W. Oceandy D. Abe J. Neyses L. Weston A.H. Cartwright E.J. Wang X. Targeted deletion of the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 5 attenuates hypertrophic response and promotes pressure overload-induced apoptosis in the heart.Circ. Res. 2010; 106: 961-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, despite the important role of both Gq and ERK5 in cardiovascular function, the occurrence of a functional relationship between these pathways in cardiac cells had not been shown previously. In this report, we identify the atypical PKCζ as a key link underlying Gαq-coupled GPCR-mediated stimulation of the ERK5 cascade in cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts and show that this new signaling axis is relevant for angiotensin-induced hypertrophic pathways in vivo. The affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody Gαq/11 (C19) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The rabbit polyclonal antibody that recognizes ERK5 and the monoclonal antibody against PKCζ (C24E6) were from Cell Signaling Technologies (Billerica, MA). The anti-phospho-ERK5 (phospho-Thr/phospho-Tyr218/220) polyclonal antibody was purchased from Invitrogen). Angiotensin II was obtained from Sigma, and the myristoylated PKCζ pseudosubstrate peptide (Myr-SIYRRGARRWRKL) from BIOSOURCE (Camarillo, CA). Pertussis toxin was purchased from Biomol Research Laboratories (Plymouth Meeting, PA). All other reagents were of the highest commercially available grades. Primary cultures of neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts were prepared from C57BL/6J mice or PKCζ-deficient mice or wild-type animals (SV129J background) by dissociation of neonatal (1–2 days) hearts. After plating to remove fibroblasts for 2 h, cardiomyocytes were plated in M12 multiwell precoated with 0.02% gelatin (300,000 cells per well) and cultured in DMEM plus 10% serum for 48 h. Cardiomyocytes were cultured for 2 days before use, whereas cardiac fibroblasts were expanded and passed twice before the assay to remove contamination by endothelial cells. Both cell types were cultured in DMEM (D5648, Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% FBS. In all cases, the desired cell type was stimulated with angiotensin II (100 nm) in serum-free medium, during the indicated time periods. The cells were serum-starved for 5–6 h before ligand addition to minimize basal kinase activity. Treatment with the PKCζ pseudosubstrate inhibitor (10 μm) was initiated 30 min before agonist stimulation. For the inactivation of Gi proteins, cells were pretreated with pertussis toxin (100 ng/ml) for 16 h. Isolation of cardiac myocytes was performed as described previously (27.Fernández-Velasco M. Goren N. Benito G. Blanco-Rivero J. Boscá L. Delgado C. Regional distribution of hyperpolarization-activated current (If) and hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel mRNA expression in ventricular cells from control and hypertrophied rat hearts.J. Physiol. 2003; 553: 395-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Adult male C57BL6 mice or Wistar rats were heparinized (4 units/g) and anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg). The hearts were removed and mounted on a Langerdorff perfusion apparatus. The ascending aorta was cannulated, and a retrograde perfusion was set up. The hearts were perfused successively with the following oxygenated solutions at 36 °C: 1) standard nominally Ca2+-free Tyrode solution (3 min) and 2) standard nominally Ca2+-free Tyrode solution (15 min) containing type II collagenase. The hearts were removed from the Langerdorff apparatus, and after removal of atria, the ventricles were cut off and gently shaken for 3 min in a standard Tyrode solution containing 0.1 mm CaCl2 to disperse the isolated cells. The resulting cell suspensions were filtered through a 250-μm nylon mesh and centrifuged for 4 min at 20 × g. Finally, the cell pellets were stored in Tyrode solution (1 mm CaCl2) and stimulated with angiotensin II (100 nm) shortly after extraction. Primary neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes were reverse-transfected using siRNA-specific oligonucleotides for PKCζ (mouse PRKCZ, NM_008860, On-target PLUS SMARTpool L-040823-00-0005, sequences GAUCGACCAGUCCGAAUUU, CAAGGCCUCACACACGUCUUA, CAUCAAGUCUCAUGCCUUC, and GGGCAUGCCUUGUCCUGGA) were purchased from Dharmacon (Roche Applied Science, Palo Alto, CA). Scrambled oligonucleotides were purchased from Ambion to serve as a negative control. siRNAs were transfected using DharmaFECT 1 reagent (Dharmacon) to reach a final concentration of 50 nm. A PKCζ-specific antibody (Cell Signaling) was utilized to assess effective knockdown of the kinase by Western blot. The activation state of ERK5 was measured by Western blot analysis of cell lysates by using specific anti-phospho-ERK5 (1:500) or anti-ERK5 (1:500) antibodies. In the latter case, the stimulation of ERK5 can be detected by the presence of a band with slower electrophoretic mobility that represents the active, phosphorylated form of the protein (28.Xu B.E. Stippec S. Lenertz L. Lee B.H. Zhang W. Lee Y.K. Cobb M.H. WNK1 activates ERK5 by an MEKK2/3-dependent mechanism.J. Biol.

To obtain cell lysates, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS buffer plus 1 mm sodium orthovanadate and subsequently solubilized in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.25% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm NaF, supplemented with 1 mm sodium orthovanadate plus a mixture of protease inhibitors). Lysates were resolved by 6–10% SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblot analysis as described previously (32.Elorza A. Sarnago S. Mayor Jr., F. Agonist-dependent modulation of G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 by mitogen-activated protein kinases.Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 778-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Bands were quantified by laser scanner densitometry, and the amount of phospho-ERK5 protein was normalized to the amount of the total loaded protein (ERK5 or GAPDH/actin/α-tubulin), as assessed by the specific antibodies. Statistical analysis was performed using the two-tailed Student's t test, as indicated. The generation of PKCζ knock-out mice (SV129J background) has been described previously (33.Leitges M. Sanz L.

Littermate wild-type and PKCζ−/− male mice (32 weeks of age) were subjected to continuous infusion of angiotensin II (or PBS as a control) for 14 days, a well established model for the induction of cardiac hypertrophy (8.Ikeda Y.

Angiotensin II dissolved in PBS was continuously and subcutaneously infused at a rate of 432 μg/kg/day using Alzet osmotic minipumps (model 2002, Alza Corp., Mountain View, CA) implanted dorsally under isofluorane anesthesia as reported (34.Braz J.C.

Heart rate and electrocardiogram (ECG) components were measured using a non-invasive recording electrocardiogram method in conscious mice (ECGenieTM ECG Screening System (Mouse Specifics, Inc., Boston, MA)) at 14 days after pump implantation as reported (35.Chu V. Otero J.M. Lopez O. Morgan J.P. Amende I. Hampton T.G. Method for non-invasively recording electrocardiograms in conscious mice.BMC Physiol. 2001; 1: 6Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Before sacrifice, blood plasma samples were obtained to assess circulating levels of pro-ANP (1–98), which reflects chronic levels of ANP secretion (36.Missbichler A. Hawa G. Schmal N. Woloszczuk W.

Finally, hearts from wild-type or knock-out mice were excised and cleaned of blood, the weight of the whole heart was measured and the ratio to body weight or tibia length was calculated. Mice were maintained under pathogen-free conditions, and all of the experiments were performed in accordance with guidelines of the European Convention for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals used for Experimental and Other Scientific Purposes (Directive 86/609/EEC) and with the authorization of the Bioethical Committee of the University Autónoma of Madrid (CEI-21-440). For histological analysis, hearts from wild-type or PKCζ knock-out mice were fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin wax. Sections of 5 μm were processed for immunohistochemistry. To compare the expression of Ets-1 and activated MEF2C and MEK5 in wild-type versus knock-out mice, a high temperature antigen unmasking technique (10-min microwaving of slides in Tris-EDTA, pH 8.0, for 90 s) was carried out. Antigen retrieval was performed after deparaffinization to enhance staining. Sections were then incubated with 5% horse serum for 30 min, and then washed three times with sterile PBS (pH 7.5) prior to incubation with the appropriate primary antibodies at 1:50/1:100 dilutions. Biotin-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories and used at 1:4000 dilution. For all antibodies, signal was amplified using avidin peroxidase (ABC Elite Kit Vector) and visualized using diaminobenzidine as a substrate (DAB kit, Vector Laboratories). Finally, sections were stained with hematoxylin. Image analysis was performed with ImageJ 1.46a software (Wayne Rasband, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Four images were acquired from randomly selected locations in each slide. Random RGB images were converted to 8-bit images for the quantification of the DAB signal to obtain the integrated density parameters (38.Wang Q. Symes A.J. Kane C.A. Freeman A. Nariculam J.

Total RNA from hearts of PBS- or angiotensin-treated animals was extracted with using RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following the manufacturer's recommendations. The integrity of the RNA populations was tested in the Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) showing 28 S/18 S ratios above 1.7. Gene expression levels for Nppa, Col1α2, and Mapk7 were determined using quantitative real-time PCR. Total RNA (1 μg) was reverse-transcribed into cDNA by the Gene Ampkit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). qRT-PCR reactions were performed in triplicates in a 10-μl final volume with the cDNA amount equivalent to 5 ng of total RNA, 250 nm of each primer, and 5 μl of Power Sybr Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, PN 4367659) using a CFX 384 Real-time system, C1000 Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad). A melting curve was included at the end of the program to verify the specificity of the PCR product. PCR primer sequences were selected using Universal Probe Library (Roche Applied Science) (see supplemental Table S1). The expression values were normalized using the average of the housekeeping genes 18 S ribosomal RNA, hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase, and GAPDH. Total RNA was purified from mice hearts using RNeasy fibrous tissue mini kit, following the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). RNA was hybridized to Mouse Expression MOE 430 2.0 Affymetrix GeneChips, containing more than 45,000 probe sets covering the mouse transcriptome. CEL files obtained after biochip scanning were used to normalize gene expression values using RMA (40.Bolstad B.M. Irizarry R.A. Astrand M. Speed T.P.

https://openalex.org/W1984378286,"In chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), the BCR-ABL fusion oncoprotein activates multiple pathways involved in cell survival, growth promotion and disease progression. In this report, we show that the signal-transducing adaptor protein-2 (STAP-2) is involved in BCR-ABL activity. We demonstrate that STAP-2 bound to BCR-ABL, and BCR and ABL proteins, depending on the STAP-2 Src homology 2-like domain. BCR-ABL phosphorylates STAP-2 Tyr250 and the phosphorylated STAP-2 in turn upregulated BCR-ABL phosphorylation, leading to enhanced activation of downstream signaling molecules including ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase), STAT5 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 5), BCL-xL (B-cell lymphoma-extra large) and BCL-2(B-cell lymphoma 2). In addition, STAP-2 interacts with BCR-ABL to alter chemokine receptor expression leading to downregulation of CXCR4 and upregulation of CCR7. The interaction between STAP-2 and BCR-ABL plays a crucial role in conferring a growth advantage and resistance to imatinib, a BCR-ABL inhibitor, as well as tumor progression. Notably, mice injected with BCR-ABL/STAP-2-expressing Ba/F3 cells developed lymph node enlargement and hepatosplenomegaly. Moreover, suppression of STAP-2 in K562 CML cells resulted in no tumor formation in mice. Our results demonstrate a critical contribution of STAP-2 in BCR-ABL activity, and suggest that STAP-2 might be an important candidate for drug development for patients with CML. Furthermore, the expression of STAP-2 provides useful information for estimating the characteristics of individual CML clones."
https://openalex.org/W2025493404,"Adult mammalian cells can be reprogrammed into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by a limited combination of transcription factors. To date, most current iPSC generation protocols rely on viral vector usage in vitro, using cells removed from their physiological context. Such protocols are hindered by low derivation efficiency and risks associated with genome modifications of reprogrammed cells. Here, we reprogrammed cells in an in vivo context using non-viral somatic transgenesis in Xenopus tadpole tail muscle, a setting that provides long term expression of non-integrated transgenes in vivo. Expression of mouse mOct4, mSox2, and mKlf4 (OSK) led rapidly and reliably to formation of proliferating cell clusters. These clusters displayed the principal hallmarks of pluripotency: alkaline phosphatase activity, up-regulation of key epigenetic and chromatin remodeling markers, and reexpression of endogenous pluripotent markers. Furthermore, these clusters were capable of differentiating into derivatives of the three germ layers in vitro and into neurons and muscle fibers in vivo. As in situ reprogramming occurs along with muscle tissue repair, the data provide a link between these two processes and suggest that they act synergistically. Notably, every OSK injection resulted in cluster formation. We conclude that reprogramming is achievable in an anamniote model and propose that in vivo approaches could provide rapid and efficient alternative for non-viral iPSC production. The work opens new perspectives in basic stem cell research and in the longer term prospect of regenerative medicine protocols development.

To date, reprogramming to iPSC mainly relies on the use of retroviral delivery methods and is a gradual process occurring over 1–2 weeks in vitro (1.Takahashi K. Yamanaka S.

Reversing terminally differentiated cells to pluripotency through reprogramming is not a new notion. It was first introduced in amphibians half a century ago when Sir J. Gurdon and his colleagues successfully cloned tadpoles from differentiated Xenopus cell nuclei transplanted into the cytoplasm of unfertilized eggs (14.Gurdon J.B. From nuclear transfer to nuclear reprogramming: the reversal of cell differentiation.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2006; 22: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Following this pioneering demonstration, nuclear reprogramming by somatic nuclear transfer has been achieved in many mammalian species (12.Okita K. Yamanaka S. Induced pluripotent stem cells: opportunities and challenges.Philos. Trans. R Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2011; 366: 2198-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 15.Hochedlinger K. Jaenisch R. Nuclear reprogramming and pluripotency.Nature. 2006; 441: 1061-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). More recently, reprogramming of mammalian nuclei to a pluripotent-like status by Xenopus oocyte cytoplasm demonstrated that the Xenopus oocyte can override the stability of mammalian cell differentiation (16.Gurdon J.B. Melton D.A. Nuclear reprogramming in cells.Science. 2008; 322: 1811-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, whereas all vertebrates share pluripotency, most data on reprogramming comes from mammalian systems, mainly human and mouse. Moreover, the in vitro protocols used for iPSC generation do not take into account contexts that might impact on the reprogramming process and its efficiency at higher order levels (e.g. tissue, organ, system). Therefore, reprogramming approaches to generate iPSCs in vivo, which remain poorly investigated, would allow to explore the influence of the native environment of the cells to be reprogrammed. We exploited the experimental advantages of the Xenopus model to explore the ability to reprogram Xenopus differentiated cells in vivo. We used in vivo non-viral somatic transgenesis that allows long lasting gene expression in live tadpoles (17.de Luze A. Sachs L. Demeneix B. Thyroid hormone-dependent transcriptional regulation of exogenous genes transferred into Xenopus tadpole muscle in vivo.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 7322-7326Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 18.Rowe I. Le Blay K. Du Pasquier D. Palmier K. Levi G. Demeneix B. Coen L. Apoptosis of tail muscle during amphibian metamorphosis involves a caspase 9-dependent mechanism.Dev. Dyn. 2005; 233: 76-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We showed that combined transfection of mouse mOct4, mSox2, and mKlf4 (OSK) into Xenopus tadpole tail muscle led to proliferative cell clusters formation. Cells in these clusters expressed typical hallmarks of pluripotency, such as reactivation of endogenous pluripotent markers, and showed the capacity to differentiate into derivatives of all three germ layers. In vivo reprogramming occurred in every tadpole transfected, probably being facilitated by simultaneous muscle repair. We conclude that reprogramming can be efficiently obtained by non-viral methods in vivo and that Xenopus reprogrammed cells share properties with mammalian iPSCs. Xenopus laevis tadpoles were raised as described (18.Rowe I. Le Blay K. Du Pasquier D. Palmier K. Levi G. Demeneix B. Coen L. Apoptosis of tail muscle during amphibian metamorphosis involves a caspase 9-dependent mechanism.Dev. Dyn. 2005; 233: 76-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and staged according to Nieuwkoop and Faber (19.Nieuwkoop P.D. Faber J. Normal Table of Xenopus laevis (Daudin): A Systematical and Chronological Survey of the Development from the Fertilized Egg till the End of Metamorphosis. Garland Publishing, New York1994Google Scholar). Sacrifices and animal studies were conducted according to the principles and procedures described in Guidelines for Care and Use of Experimental Animals. Somatic gene transfer was carried out as described previously using perchlorated tadpoles at stage NF55 (18.Rowe I. Le Blay K. Du Pasquier D. Palmier K. Levi G. Demeneix B. Coen L. Apoptosis of tail muscle during amphibian metamorphosis involves a caspase 9-dependent mechanism.Dev. Dyn. 2005; 233: 76-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In brief, 1 μl of different plasmid mixes was injected intramuscularly at the concentrations indicated in the text. DNA constructs used were: peGFP-C1 (CMV-GFP) and pDsRed2-N1 (CMV-RFP) (Clontech); pGL3 (CMV-LUC) (Invitrogen); CMV-mOct4 and CMV-mSox2; SV40-LUC. Mouse Klf4 cDNA was PCR-amplified and cloned in the pCMV-3×FLAG plasmid (Sigma), giving CMV-mKlf4. Plasmids were purified using the QiaFilter kit (Qiagen). pCMV-3×FLAG was used as an empty vector to equalize the DNA amount for each injection. In toto GFP reporter expression was monitored on living tadpoles before further analyses. Before being processed for immunohistochemical analyses, cell cultures were PFA-fixed (4% in PBS for 10 min at 4 °C), and injected tail muscles were dissected, PFA-fixed (4% in PBS for 3 h at 4 °C), and sectioned using a cryostat (14 μm). Immunodetection was carried out as described previously (20.Coen L. Le Blay K. Rowe I. Demeneix B.A. Caspase-9 regulates apoptosis/proliferation balance during metamorphic brain remodeling in Xenopus.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 8502-8507Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) on sections or fixed cell cultures, using the following primary antibodies: rabbit anti-phosphohistone H3 (1:300; Upstate Biotechnology), rabbit anti-active caspase 3 (1:250; BD Biosciences Pharmigen), rabbit anti-β-tubulin III (1:300; Sigma), mouse anti-MZ15 (1:500; DSHB), mouse anti-NCAM (1:300; DSHB), rabbit anti-mKlf4 (1:150; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit anti-mOct4 (1:400; Abcam), mouse anti-HA (1:100; Sigma), mouse anti-Pax7 (1:300; DSHB), rabbit anti-GFP (1:300; Invitrogen), and the appropriate secondary fluorescent antibodies (1:1500). 5-Bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling was carried out using BrdU Labeling and Detection kit I (Roche Applied Science) following intraperitoneal injection of 2 μl of BrdU (1 mg/ml) in NF55 perchlorated tadpoles every 2 days after transfection. Alkaline phosphatase activity was revealed using the AM0100–1KT kit (Sigma). All sections were DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole)-counterstained and mounted in Moviol (Calbiochem) before observation under light and fluorescent microscopy. Cell cultures were derived from tadpole muscles at 7 or 12 days after transfection according to the previously reported protocol (21.Shibota Y. Kaneko Y. Kuroda M. Nishikawa A. Larval-to-adult conversion of a myogenic system in the frog, Xenopus laevis, by larval-type myoblast-specific control of cell division, cell differentiation, and programmed cell death by triiodo-l-thyronine.Differentiation. 2000; 66: 227-238Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were cultured at 20 °C in 70% Leibovitz L-15 medium (Invitrogen) with 5× serum replacement (Sigma) supplemented with antibiotic (Invitrogen). Treatments (3 or 5 days) were carried out with retinoic acid (1 μm), recombinant mouse FGF-8b (50 ng/ml), recombinant mouse Noggin/Fc chimera (50 ng/ml), recombinant human/mouse/rat activin A (5, 50, or 100 ng/ml). All molecules were from R&D Systems, except retinoic acid (Sigma). Cultured cells were fixed with 4% PFA in PBS for 30 min at 4 °C, rinsed in PBS, and immunostained with corresponding antibodies, as described above. For each point monitored, RNA extractions were performed on three pooled muscle samples or trypsinized cell cultures. The protocol, primers, graphical representations, and statistical analyses are detailed in supplemental Experimental Procedures and supplemental Table S1. Heparin-acrylic beads (Sigma) were incubated for 2.5 h at room temperature with FGF-8 (10 μg/ml), Noggin (10 μg/ml), or BSA 0.1% (Sigma), then washed in PBS. For each factor, one bead was implanted subcutaneously at 12 days post-injection (dpi) in each transfected myomere (see Fig. 1). After 5 days, muscles were fixed with 4% PFA in PBS for 3h at 4 °C, rinsed in PBS, then sectioned and immunostained with anti-β-tubulin III (1:300). Transgenic animals were obtained according to the modified Kroll and Amaya protocol (22.Coen L. du Pasquier D. Le Mevel S. Brown S. Tata J. Mazabraud A. Demeneix B.A. Xenopus Bcl-X(L) selectively protects Rohon-Beard neurons from metamorphic degeneration.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 7869-7874Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In the pNanog-GFP transgenic line, GFP reporter expression is placed under the control of the promoter sequence [−332/+50] of the mouse pluripotency gene mNanog (23.Kuroda T. Tada M. Kubota H. Kimura H. Hatano S.Y. Suemori H. Nakatsuji N. Tada T. Octamer and Sox elements are required for transcriptional cis regulation of Nanog gene expression.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2475-2485Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). In the pCar-GFP transgenic line, GFP reporter expression is placed under the control of the actin cardiac promoter, leading to a specific GFP expression in cardiac and skeletal muscle (24.Das B. Schreiber A.M. Huang H. Brown D.D. Multiple thyroid hormone-induced muscle growth and death programs during metamorphosis in Xenopus laevis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 12230-12235Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). OSK injection was performed in perchlorated NF55-staged pCar-GFP transgenic tadpoles. At 10 dpi, injected muscles were dissected and placed in cold filtered PBS (pH 7.5). The muscle region containing clusters were dissected into 0.4 mm2-faced cubes and placed in cold L-15 medium, with 1× serum replacement supplemented with antibiotic. Cubes were transplanted intramuscularly into perchlorated WT tadpoles at the same developmental stage (NF55). Two months later, tail muscles were fixed with 4% PFA in PBS for 3 h at 4 °C, rinsed in PBS, then cryosectioned (120 μm), and floating sections were immunostained with rabbit anti-GFP (1:300) and mounted in Moviol before observation under fluorescent microscopy. Non-integrative, non-viral, and non-replicative expression vectors encoding mouse OSK and/or GFP, all under the transcriptional control of the CMV promoter, were injected in Xenopus pre-metamorphic tadpole tail muscles at various doses (see “Experimental Procedures,” Fig. 1A, and supplemental Fig. S1 for optimization experiments). This “naked” DNA-based gene delivery method is known to specifically transfect muscle fibers without integration (25.Braun S. Muscular gene transfer using nonviral vectors.Curr. Gene. Ther. 2008; 8: 391-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and, in that way, is used for human vaccination (26.Dueñas-Carrera S. DNA vaccination against hepatitis C.Curr. Opin. Mol. Ther. 2004; 6: 146-150PubMed Google Scholar). The conditions used in somatic injection experiments yielded an average of 25 transfected muscle fibers per injected tadpole as estimated by GFP expression (data not shown). Three dpi, GFP was detectable only in differentiated muscle fibers of both OSK-injected and control animals. However, the GFP-expressing fibers were rapidly lost in OSK-transfected muscles concomitantly with the appearance of large, dense cell clusters (Fig. 1, B and C). Clusters occurred at all tested plasmid concentrations (100, 200, and 400 ng/μl; Fig. 2, A–C and E–G), many filling the space previously occupied by a lost GFP-expressing fiber (supplemental Fig. S2, A–C). OSK-injected tadpoles frequently showed several clusters in the transfected area (Fig. 2, A–C and clearly seen in supplemental Fig. S2A). Furthermore, nuclei in the area surrounding the site of OSK injection were disorganized, contrasting with the regular nuclear distribution of GFP-injected control muscles (compare Fig. 2D and supplemental Fig. S2D). This disorganized nuclear distribution also clearly differed from that of apoptotic muscle fibers (supplemental Fig. S2, E and F), frequently seen following somatic transfection in muscle (18.Rowe I. Le Blay K. Du Pasquier D. Palmier K. Levi G. Demeneix B. Coen L. Apoptosis of tail muscle during amphibian metamorphosis involves a caspase 9-dependent mechanism.Dev. Dyn. 2005; 233: 76-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Nuclei morphology also differed, with large nuclei present in intact fibers (Fig. 2H) and 2–3 times smaller nuclei in clusters (Fig. 2I). Using 200 ng/μl plasmid-injected concentration, the clusters were observed in 30% of OSK-transfected tadpoles at 3 dpi and in 100% at 7 dpi (Fig. 2J); at 21 dpi, smaller clusters were still observable in 20% of injected animals. Clusters never formed in control GFP-injected tadpoles (Fig. 2, D and J). Notably, cell clusters were also observed in muscles injected with individual transcription factors (O, S, or K alone); however, clusters were fewer than with OSK injection (supplemental Fig. S3). As 200 ng/μl OSK injection gave optimal cluster formation (Fig. 2J), this plasmid concentration was used in all following experiments. Given that mouse transcription factors were used, their expression can be followed unambiguously, unhampered by putative endogenous expression of the Xenopus homologues. Expression of exogenous reprogramming factors in OSK-transfected tadpoles was high at 3 and 7 dpi, then decreased strongly between 7 and 14 dpi, and was virtually undetectable by 21 dpi (supplemental Fig. S4A). Immunodetection revealed that, in OSK-transfected tadpoles, mouse proteins were detected in nuclei of GFP-positive fibers at 7 dpi, but not in cluster cells nuclei (supplemental Fig. S4, B–F). Furthermore, all mOct4-positive nuclei were Pax7-negative, implying that satellite cells are not transfected following OSK injection (supplemental Fig. S4G). The proliferative status of clusters was analyzed using the mitotic marker PH3 and BrdU labeling. At 14 dpi, clusters contained numerous PH3-positive cells (Fig. 3B) whereas no PH3 signal was seen in GFP-controls (Fig. 3A) or in non-injected tadpole muscle (data not shown). BrdU labeling showed high numbers of labeled cells in clusters at 14 dpi (Fig. 3, D and D′), confirming their proliferative nature. In GFP-controls, only rare BrdU-positive cells were detected in the injected area (Fig. 3, C and C′). As expected, epidermal BrdU incorporation was similar in OSK and GFP-control tadpoles (Fig. 3, C′ and D′). Clusters proliferated up to 14 dpi. At 21 dpi, when cluster size decreased, PH3 labeling was lost concomitantly with an increase of caspase 3-positive cells, suggesting that apoptosis might be involved in cluster reduction (Fig. 3, E–G). Alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity, routinely used as a pluripotency marker for embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and iPSCs (27.Smith K.P. Luong M.X. Stein G.S. Pluripotency: toward a gold standard for human ES and iPS cells.J. Cell. Physiol. 2009; 220: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), was strongly detected in OSK clusters (Fig. 3, I and I′). No AP activity was observed in GFP-controls (Fig. 3, H and H′), except in blood vessels, which are known to be AP-positive (28.Chan J. Serluca F.C. Chemical approaches to angiogenesis.Methods Cell Biol. 2004; 76: 475-487Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). AP expression suggests a return to an undifferentiated state. To assess further this possibility, reactivation of a pluripotency program in OSK-injected muscles was evaluated using different markers. Following injection, myogenic markers were similarly reactivated in GFP-controls and OSK-injected muscles (supplemental Fig. S5); however, significant differences were observed for endogenous homologues of mammalian markers of pluripotency (Fig. 3J). Notably, OSK-injected muscle showed specific activation of xoct91, the functional homologue of mammalian Oct4 (29.Morrison G.M. Brickman J.M. Conserved roles for Oct4 homologues in maintaining multipotency during early vertebrate development.Development. 2006; 133: 2011-2022Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), of nr5a2, a regulator of Oct4 expression in pluripotency (30.Heng J.C. Orlov Y.L. Ng H.H. Transcription factors for the modulation of pluripotency and reprogramming.Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 2010; 75: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and of gdf3, a TGF-β family member involved in regulation of the pluripotent state (31.Liu N. Lu M. Tian X. Han Z. Molecular mechanisms involved in self-renewal and pluripotency of embryonic stem cells.J. Cell. Physiol. 2007; 211: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and in iPSCs reprogramming (32.Li R. Liang J. Ni S. Zhou T. Qing X. Li H. He W. Chen J. Li F. Zhuang Q. Qin B. Xu J. Li W.

As for xoct91, gdf3 expression was specific to OSK-injected muscles and maintained for 3 weeks. Expression of xsox2 and xsox3, two genes related to mammalian Sox2 (34.Chambers I. Tomlinson S.R. The transcriptional foundation of pluripotency.Development. 2009; 136: 2311-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), was significantly down-regulated in GFP-controls and up-regulated in OSK-injected tadpoles as the reprogramming process progressed. We also examined reactivation of xventx2, previously described as expressed in multipotent stem cells in Xenopus (35.Papalopulu N. Kintner C. A Xenopus gene, Xbr-1, defines a novel class of homeobox genes and is expressed in the dorsal ciliary margin of the eye.Dev. Biol. 1996; 174: 104-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and proposed to share a functional relationship with Nanog (36.Cao Y. Knöchel S. Donow C. Miethe J. Kaufmann E. Knöchel W. The POU factor Oct-25 regulates the Xvent-2B gene and counteracts terminal differentiation in Xenopus embryos.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43735-43743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). 7P. Scerbo, F. Girardot, C. Vivien, G. V. Markov, G. Luxardi, B. A. Demeneix, L. Kodjabachian, and L. Coen, unpublished data. As for xoct91, xventx2 was precociously activated in OSK samples. xventx2 expression was totally down-regulated at 14 dpi, suggesting that reprogrammed cells at this time might be responsive to differentiation cues. Intriguingly, we observed reexpression of xventx2 in both OSK and GFP-control muscles at 21 dpi, suggesting an unknown role for this factor during late muscle repair. To validate further the establishment of a transcriptional state similar to that of mammalian pluripotent cells in these clusters, a transgenic Xenopus line expressing GFP under the promoter of the mouse pluripotency factor mNanog (pNanog-GFP) was used. Similar readouts, using transgenic cell lines expressing GFP under the control of either the Oct4 or the Nanog promoters (7.Okita K. Ichisaka T. Yamanaka S. Generation of germ line-competent induced pluripotent stem cells.Nature. 2007; 448: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (3532) Google Scholar, 11.Okita K. Nakagawa M. Hyenjong H. Ichisaka T. Yamanaka S.

The efficient generation of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells from adult mouse adipose tissue-derived and neural stem cells.Cell Transplant. 2010; 19: 525-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), are commonly used in mammalian systems to define whether cultured somatic cells transfected with reprogramming factors have reached full iPSC (i.e. pluripotent) status. Thus, using pNanog-GFP transgenic tadpoles, the OSK plasmid mix was injected into the muscle without the CMV-GFP construct. In this case, GFP expression therefore reflected activation of the mouse Nanog promoter integrated in the genome. As shown in Fig. 3L, OSK injection resulted in GFP expression specifically in clusters, but not in non-transfected muscle cells. Reprogramming is facilitated if epigenetic switches and chromatin remodeling are activated (40.De Carvalho D.D. You J.S. Jones P.A.
