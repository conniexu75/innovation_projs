Many hospital readmissions are avoidable, and excessive hospital readmissions could also be harmful to the patients. Accurate prediction of hospital readmission can effectively help reduce the readmission risk. However, the complex relationship between readmission and potential risk factors makes readmission prediction a difficult task. The main goal of this paper is to explore deep learning models to distill such complex relationships and make accurate predictions.We propose CONTENT, a deep model that predicts hospital readmissions via learning interpretable patient representations by capturing both local and global contexts from patient Electronic Health Records (EHR) through a hybrid Topic Recurrent Neural Network (TopicRNN) model. The experiment was conducted using the EHR of a real world Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) cohort of 5,393 patients.The proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in readmission prediction (e.g. 0.6103 ± 0.0130 vs. second best 0.5998 ± 0.0124 in terms of ROC-AUC). The derived patient representations were further utilized for patient phenotyping. The learned phenotypes provide more precise understanding of readmission risks.Embedding both local and global context in patient representation not only improves prediction performance, but also brings interpretable insights of understanding readmission risks for heterogeneous chronic clinical conditions.This is the first of its kind model that integrates the power of both conventional deep neural network and the probabilistic generative models for highly interpretable deep patient representation learning. Experimental results and case studies demonstrate the improved performance and interpretability of the model."

Then, plasma activated waters are used during the later stage of plant development and growth until 42 days. The effects on both testa and endospserm ruptures during the germination stage are significant in the case of air plasma due to its higher energy and efficiency of producing reactive oxygen species than the case of helium plasma. The latter has shown distinct effects only for testa rupture. Analysis of germination stimulations are based on specific stainings for reactive oxygen species production, peroxidase activity and also membrane permeability tests. Furthermore, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) has shown a smoother seed surface for air plasma treated seeds that can explain the plasma induced-germination. During the growth stage, plants were watered using 4 kinds of water (tap and deionized waters activated or not by the low temperature plasma jet). With regards to other water kinds, the characterization of the tap water has shown a larger conductivity, acidity and concentration of reactive nitrogen and oxygen species. Only the tap water activated by the plasma jet has shown a significant effect on the plant growth. This effect could be correlated to reactive nitrogen species such as nitrite/nitrate species present in plasma activated tap water."

The aim of this study is to investigate the association between long-term exposure to ambient air pollution and subjective stress, depressive disorders, health-related quality of life (QoL) and suicide. We selected 124,205 adults from the Korean Community Health Survey in 2013 who were at least 19 years old and who had lived in their current domiciles for > five years. Based on the computer-assisted personal interviews to measure subjective stress in daily life, EuroQoL-5 dimensions, depression diagnosis by a doctor, suicidal ideation, and suicidal attempts, we evaluated the risk of mental disorders using multiple logistic regression analysis according to the quartiles of air pollutants, such as particulate matter <10μm (PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and sulfur dioxide, using yearly average concentration between August 2012 and July 2013. The prevalence of high stress, poor QoL, depressiveness, diagnosis of depression, and suicide ideation was positively associated with high concentrations of PM10, NO2, and CO after adjusting for confounding factors. Men were at increased risk of stress, poor QoL, and depressiveness from air pollution exposure than were women. The risk of higher stress or poor QoL in subjects < age 65 increased with air pollution more than did that in subjects ≥ age 65. Long-term exposure to ambient air pollution may be an independent risk factor for mental health disorders ranging from subjective stress to suicide ideation."
https://openalex.org/W2797970676,"Cell signaling is the process by which extracellular information is transmitted into the cell to perform useful biological functions. The ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase) signaling controls several cellular processes such as cell growth, proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. The ERK signaling pathway considered in this work starts with an extracellular stimulus and ends with activated (double phosphorylated) ERK which gets translocated into the nucleus. We model and analyze this complex pathway by decomposing it into three functional subsystems. The first subsystem spans the initial part of the pathway from the extracellular growth factor to the formation of the SOS complex, ShC-Grb2-SOS. The second subsystem includes the activation of Ras which is mediated by the SOS complex. This is followed by the MAPK subsystem (or the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway) which produces the double phosphorylated ERK upon being activated by Ras. Although separate models exist in the literature at the subsystems level, a comprehensive model for the complete system including the important regulatory feedback loops is missing. Our dynamic model combines the existing subsystem models and studies their steady-state and dynamic interactions under feedback. We establish conditions under which bistability and oscillations exist for this important pathway. In particular, we show how the negative and positive feedback loops affect the dynamic characteristics that determine the cellular outcome."
https://openalex.org/W2798223815,"The paper presents the results of an experiment on the effect of pre-sowing stimulation of seeds with atmospheric pressure plasma jet operating with dielectric barrier discharge (DBD plasma jet) on the process of germination of Thuringian Mallow (Lavatera thuringiaca L.). Five groups of seeds characterized by a different exposure times (1, 2, 5, 10 and 15 minutes) as well as untreated seeds-control were used. Pre-sowing plasma stimulation of seeds improved germination parameters such as: germination capacity and germination energy for all tested groups relative to control. The highest germination parameters were obtained for seeds stimulated with plasma for the exposure times of 2 and 5 min. The analysis of the contact surface angle indicated the decrease of its' mean values upon seed stimulation while no statistical effects were observed. Analysis of the SEM scans revealed the increase in seed pattern intensity which could be attributed to removing of the surface parts of cuticle possibly covered with wax upon short time-2 and 5 min plasma treatment. Such a phenomenon can act similarly to mechanical scarification of seeds. Longer exposure of seeds to plasma resulted in affecting the deeper zone of cuticle and damage or fracture of some parts of the cuticle. Lower germination parameters of seeds upon longer exposure times to plasma may indicate mechanical damage of the seeds."

Recently, technical improvements in vitrification make deferred frozen-thawed embryo transfer (Def-ET) a feasible alternative to fresh embryo transfer (ET). In endometriosis-related infertility the eutopic endometrium is abnormal and its functional alterations are seen as likely to alter the quality of endometrial receptivity. One question in the endometriosis ART-management is to know whether Def-ET could restore optimal receptivity in endometriosis-affected women leading to increase in pregnancy rates.To compare cumulative ART-outcomes between fresh versus Def-ET in endometriosis-infertile women.This matched cohort study compared def-ET strategy to fresh ET strategy between 01/10/2012 and 31/12/2014. One hundred and thirty-five endometriosis-affected women with a scheduled def-ET cycle and 424 endometriosis-affected women with a scheduled fresh ET cycle were eligible for matching. Matching criteria were: age, number of prior ART cycles, and endometriosis phenotype. Statistical analyses were conducted using univariable and multivariable logistic regression models.135 in the fresh ET group and 135 in the def-ET group were included in the analysis. The cumulative clinical pregnancy rate was significantly increased in the def-ET group compared to the fresh ET group [58 (43%) vs. 40 (29.6%), p = 0.047]. The cumulative ongoing pregnancy rate was 34.8% (n = 47) and 17.8% (n = 24) respectively in the Def-ET and the fresh-ET groups (p = 0.005). After multivariable conditional logistic regression analysis, Def-ET was associated with a significant increase in the cumulative ongoing pregnancy rate as compared to fresh ET (OR = 1.76, CI95% 1.06-2.92, p = 0.028).Def-ET in endometriosis-affected women was associated with significantly higher cumulative ongoing pregnancy rates. Our preliminary results suggest that Def-ET for endometriosis-affected women is an attractive option that could increase their ART success rates. Future studies, with a randomized design, should be conducted to further confirm those results."
https://openalex.org/W2797298358,"Background The impact of body composition on the short- or long-term outcomes of patients with surgically treated advanced rectal cancer after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy remains unclear. This study examined the correlation between low skeletal muscle mass and morbidity and survival in patients with advanced lower rectal cancer. Methods We enrolled 144 clinical stage II/III patients with advanced lower rectal cancer who underwent neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by curative resection between 2004 and 2011. The cross-sectional skeletal muscle area at the third lumbar vertebra (L3) level was evaluated by computed tomography before chemoradiotherapy, and this was normalized by the square of the height to obtain the skeletal muscle index. Low skeletal muscle mass was defined as the sex-specific lowest quartile of the L3 skeletal muscle index. The association between low skeletal muscle mass and morbidity, relapse-free survival, or overall survival was assessed. Results Low skeletal muscle mass was identified in 37 (25.7%) patients. Age and body mass index were associated with low skeletal muscle mass. By multivariate analysis, we found that low skeletal muscle mass was independently associated with poor overall survival (hazard ratio = 2.93; 95%CI: 1.11–7.71; p = 0.031) and relapse-free survival (hazard ratio = 2.15; 95%CI: 1.06–4.21; p = 0.035), but was not associated with the rate of postoperative complications. Conclusions Low skeletal muscle mass is an independent negative prognostic factor for relapse-free and overall survival in patients with advanced lower rectal cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2798100183,"Microenvironmental conditions can influence the differentiation and functional roles of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Recent studies have suggested that an inflammatory microenvironment can significantly affect the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. Here, we show, for the first time, that IL-10 has concentration-dependent, dual roles in the osteogenesis of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs). Low physiologic concentrations of IL-10 (0.01–1.0 ng/ml) activate the p38/MAPK signaling pathway to promote the osteogenesis of hBMSCs, but higher pathologic doses of IL-10 (10–100 ng/ml) inhibit p38/MAPK signaling by activating NF-κB, inhibiting osteogenesis. These results demonstrate that p38/MAPK and NF-κB signaling mediates the double-edged sword effect of IL-10 on hBMSCs. The osteogenic impairment was reversed at higher doses of IL-10 when cells were supplemented with the NF-κB inhibitor BAY11–7082. These data provide important insights into the regulatory effects of IL-10 on the biologic behavior of hBMSCs.—Chen, E., Liu, G., Zhou, X., Zhang, W., Wang, C., Hu, D., Xue, D., Pan, Z.

https://openalex.org/W2797805027,"While there is substantial evidence that adults who violate gender stereotypes often face backlash (i.e. social and economic penalties), less is known about the nature of gender stereotypes for young children, and the penalties that children may face for violating them. We conducted three experiments, with over 2000 adults from the US, to better understand the content and consequences of adults' gender stereotypes for young children. In Experiment 1, we tested which characteristics adults (N = 635) believed to be descriptive (i.e. typical), prescriptive (i.e. required), and proscriptive (i.e. forbidden) for preschool-aged boys and girls. Using the characteristics that were rated in Experiment 1, we then constructed vignettes that were either 'masculine' or 'feminine', and manipulated whether the vignettes were said to describe a boy or a girl. Experiment 2 (N = 697) revealed that adults rated stereotype-violating children as less likeable than their stereotype-conforming peers, and that this difference was more robust for boys than girls. Experiment 3 (N = 731) was a direct replication of Experiment 2, and revealed converging evidence of backlash against stereotype-violating children. In sum, our results suggest that even young children encounter backlash from adults for stereotype violations, and that these effects may be strongest for boys."
https://openalex.org/W2796650882,"Cancer affects 39.6% of Americans at some point during their lifetime. Solid tumor microenvironments are characterized by a disorganized, leaky vasculature that promotes regions of low oxygenation (hypoxia). Tumor hypoxia is a key predictor of poor treatment outcome for all radiotherapy (RT), chemotherapy and surgery procedures, and is a hallmark of metastatic potential. In particular, the radiation therapy dose needed to achieve the same tumor control probability in hypoxic tissue as in normoxic tissue can be up to 3 times higher. Even very small tumors (<2–3 mm3) comprise 10–30% of hypoxic regions in the form of chronic and/or transient hypoxia fluctuating over the course of seconds to days. We investigate the potential of recently developed lipid-stabilized oxygen microbubbles (OMBs) to improve the therapeutic ratio of RT. OMBs, but not nitrogen microbubbles (NMBs), are shown to significantly increase dissolved oxygen content when added to water in vitro and increase tumor oxygen levels in vivo in a rat fibrosarcoma model. Tumor control is significantly improved with OMB but not NMB intra-tumoral injections immediately prior to RT treatment and effect size is shown to depend on initial tumor volume on RT treatment day, as expected."
https://openalex.org/W2797755879,"The occurrence of water stress during wheat growth is more frequent due to climate change. Three experiments (cyclic drought, cyclic waterlogging, and cyclic drought plus waterlogging) were conducted to investigate the effects of mild and severe cyclic/single water stress at elongation and heading stages on winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yield. The effect of either mild drought at elongation or mild waterlogging at heading on wheat yield was not significant; however, significance did occur under other single water stresses. As the stress becomes more severe, the yield loss significantly increases. Extreme drought/waterlogging treatment at elongation caused a greater yield penalty than stress at heading stage. Except the combination of mild drought and mild waterlogging treatment, cyclic water stress significantly decreased wheat yields. The decrease in wheat yield under cyclic severe drought and waterlogging was significantly higher than any other treatment, with percentage decreases of 71.52 and 73.51%, respectively. In general, a yield reduction from mild cyclic water stress did not indicate more severe damage than single treatments; in contrast, grain yield suffered more when water stress occurred again after severe drought and waterlogging. Drought during elongation significantly decreased kernel number, whereas drought at heading/waterlogging during elongation and heading decreased the spike weight, which might be the main reason for the yield penalty. Furthermore, water stress caused variation in the decrease of total biomass and/or harvest index. The present study indicates comprehensive understanding of the types, degree, and stages of water stress are essential for assessing the impact of multiple water stresses on wheat yield."
https://openalex.org/W2797237572,"Over time dental composites age due to mechanical impacts such as chewing and chemical impacts such as saliva enzymes and food ingredients. For this research, the focus was placed on chemical degradation. The objective of this study was to simulate hydrolysis by using different food simulating liquids and to assess their impact on the mechanical parameter Vickers microhardness (MHV) and the physicochemical parameter contact angle (CA).Specimen of three composites (d = 6 mm, h = 2 mm; n = 435) classified with respect to their filler content (wt%), namely low-filled, medium-filled and highly-filled, were stored for 0, 14, 30, 90 and 180 days in artificial saliva (pH 7), citric acid (pH 3; pH 5), lactic acid (pH 3; pH 5) and ethanol (40%vol; 60%vol) and assessed regarding to MHV and CA. Statistics: Kruskal-Wallis test, stepwise linear regression, bivariate Spearman Rank Correlation (p < 0.05).While stored in artificial saliva, acid and ethanol the CA decreased especially for the low- and medium-filled composites. It was shown that rising the filler content caused less surface changes in the CA. Storage in ethanol led to a significant decrease of MHV of all composites. Regression analysis showed that the effect of in vitro aging on MHV was mainly influenced by the composite material and therefore by filler content (R2 = 0.67; p < 0.05). In contrast, the CA is more influenced by incubation time and filler content (R2 = 0.2; p < 0.05) leading to a higher risk of plaque accumulation over time. Significance: In vitro aging showed significant changes on the mechanical and physicochemical properties of dental composites which may shorten their long-term functionality. In conclusion, it can be stated, that the type of composite material, especially rising filler content seems to improve the materials' resistance against the processes of chemical degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2797272414,"Over 1.4 million people are diagnosed with colorectal cancer (CRC) each year, making it the third most common cancer in the world. Increased screening and therapeutic modalities including improved combination treatments have reduced CRC mortality, although incidence and mortality rates are still increasing in some areas. Serum-based biomarkers are mainly used for follow-up of cancer, and are ideal due to the ease and minimally invasive nature of sample collection. Unfortunately, CEA and other serum markers have too low sensitivity for screening and preoperative diagnostic purposes. Increasing interest is focused on the possible use of biomarkers for predicting treatment response and prognosis in cancer. In this study, we have performed mass spectrometry analysis (UPLC-UDMSE) of serum samples from 19 CRC patients. Increased levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), which occur during local inflammation and the presence of a systemic inflammatory response, have been linked to poor prognosis in CRC patients. We chose to analyze samples according to CRP values by dividing them into the categories CRP <30 and >30, and, separately, according to short and long 5-year survival. The aim was to discover differentially expressed proteins associated with poor prognosis and shorter survival. We quantified 256 proteins and performed detailed statistical analyses and pathway analysis. We discovered multiple proteins that are up- or downregulated in patients with CRP >30 as compared to CRP <30 and in patients with short as compared to long 5-year survival. Pathways that were enriched include LXR/RXR activation, FXR/RXR activation, complement and coagulation cascades and acute phase signaling response, with some of the proteins we identified having roles in these pathways. In this study, we have identified multiple proteins, of which a few have been previously identified as potential biomarkers, and others that have been identified as potential biomarkers for CRC for the first time, to the best of our knowledge. While these proteins still need to be validated in larger patient series, this pilot study will pave the way for future studies aiming to provide better biomarkers for patients with CRC."
https://openalex.org/W2797063605,"European plum (Prunus domestica L.) is an ancient domesticated species cultivated in temperate areas worldwide whose genetic structure has been scarcely analyzed to date. In this study, a broad representation of Spanish European plum germplasm collected in Northeastern Spain and a representative set of reference cultivars were compared using nuclear and chloroplast markers. The number of alleles per locus detected with the SSR markers ranged from 8 to 39, with an average of 23.4 alleles, and 8 haplotypes were identified. Bayesian model-based clustering, minimum spanning networks, and the analysis of molecular variance showed the existence of a hierarchical structure. At the first level, two genetic groups were found, one containing ‘Reine Claude’ type reference cultivars altogether with ca. 25% of local genotypes, and a second one much more diverse. This latter group split in two groups, one containing most (ca. 70%) local genotypes and some old Spanish and French reference cultivars, whereas the other included 24 reference cultivars and only six local genotypes. A third partition level allowed a significant finer delineation into five groups. As a whole, the genetic structure of European plum from Northeastern Spain was shown to be complex and conditioned by a geographical proximity factor. This study not only contributes to genetic conservation and breeding for this species at the national level, but also supports the relevance of undertaking similar tasks of collection and characterization in other unexplored areas. Moreover, this kind of research could lead to future coordinated actions for the examination of the whole European plum diversity, to define conservation strategies, and could be used to better understand the genetic control of traits of horticultural interest through association mapping."
https://openalex.org/W2797245611,"The growth hormone / insulin-like growth factor-1 (GH/IGF-1) pathway of the somatotropic axis is the major controller for growth rate and body size in vertebrates, but the effect of selection on the expression of GH/IGF-1 somatotropic axis genes and their association with body size and growth performance in farm animals is not fully understood. We analyzed a time series of expression profiles of GH/IGF-1 somatotropic axis genes in two chicken breeds, the Daweishan mini chickens and Wuding chickens, and the commercial Avian broilers hybrid exhibiting markedly different body sizes and growth rates. We found that growth rate and feed conversion efficiency in Daweishan mini chickens were significantly lower than those in Wuding chickens and Avian broilers. The Wuding and Daweishan mini chickens showed higher levels of plasma GH, pituitary GH mRNA but lower levels of hepatic growth hormone receptor (GHR) mRNA than in Avian broilers. Daweishan mini chickens showed significantly lower levels of plasma IGF-1, thigh muscle and hepatic IGF-1 mRNA than did Avian broilers and Wuding chickens. These results suggest that the GH part of the somatotropic axis is the main regulator of growth rate, while IGF-1 may regulate both growth rate and body weight. Selection for growth performance and body size have altered the expression profiles of somatotropic axis genes in a breed-, age-, and tissue-specific manner, and manner, and alteration of regulatory mechanisms of these genes might play an important role in the developmental characteristics of chickens."

The deposition of the layers took place during mild and cold phases between at least 42 ka (GI 10) and 36 ka calBP (GI 7). We present below a technological study of blade and bladelet production from AH IV (GH 7) at Hohle Fels. Our analyses show that blade manufacture is relatively constant, while bladelet production displays a high degree of variability in order to obtain different blanks. Knappers used a variety of burins as cores to produce fine bladelets. The results reveal a new variant of the Aurignacian in the Swabian Jura primarily characterized by the production of bladelets and microliths from burin-cores. The artefacts from the Swabian Aurignacian are technologically and functionally more diverse than earlier studies of the Geißenklösterle and Vogelherd sequences have suggested. The technological analyses presented here challenge the claim that the typo-chronological system from Southwestern Europe can be applied to the Central European Aurignacian. Instead, we emphasize the impact of technological and functional variables within the Aurignacian of the Swabian Jura."

The aim of this research study was to assess the fitness, functional performance and cognitive ability in independently living older South Africans and to determine which fitness parameters and functional performance tests best explain the variance in cognitive function.Descriptive observational study.Older adults with a mean age 71±4.7 years (n = 70; 28 men and 42 women) were recruited. Sixty percent of the sample completed at least secondary schooling and more than two-thirds were taking medication for a chronic medical condition.Self-reported physical activity was assessed using the Yale Physical Activity Survey. Fitness tests included the 6-minute walk test and Bicep Curls. The functional performance tests were; Static and Dynamic balance, Timed Up and Go, Sit to Stand, Grip strength and Functional Reach. The Stroop Task and 6-Item cognitive impairment test were used to measure cognitive performance. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were conducted between performance on the novel cognitive Stroop Task and functional and cognitive tests.We found significant relationships between the number of correct responses on the Stroop Task and scores on the 6-Item Cognitive Impairment test (-0.520, p < 0.01) and grip strength (r = 0.42, p< 0.01). The number of incorrect responses was inversely associated with functional reach (r = -0.445, p< 0.01). The final regression model included: age, dynamic balance, right arm grip strength and the score on the 6-item cognitive impairment test, and explained 44% of the variance in performance of the Stroop Task.The results of this study showed that measures of physical function were associated with cognitive performance even in highly functioning older South African adults. Further research is needed to determine the extent to which exercise training can improve functional capacity and the effect on cognitive performance."
https://openalex.org/W2797835872,"Histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2), a critical determinant of chromatin remodeling, is reduced as a consequence of oxidative stress-mediated DNA damage and impaired repair. Cigarette smoke (CS) exposure causes DNA damage and cellular senescence. However, no information is available on the role of HDAC2 in CS-induced DNA damage, stress-induced premature senescence (SIPS), and senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) during the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)/emphysema. We hypothesized that CS causes persistent DNA damage and cellular senescence via HDAC2-dependent mechanisms. We used HDAC2 global knockout (KO) and HDAC2 lung epithelial cell-specific KO [Clara cell-specific HDAC2 deletion (HDAC2 CreCC10)] mice to determine whether HDAC2 is a major player in CS-induced oxidative stress, SIPS, and SASP. HDAC2 KO mice exposed to CS show exaggerated DNA damage, inflammatory response, and decline in lung function leading to airspace enlargement. Chronic CS exposure augments lung senescence-associated β-galactosi-dase activity in HDAC2 KO, but not in HDAC2 CreCC10 mice. HDAC2 lung epithelial cell-specific KO did not further augment CS-induced inflammatory response and airspace enlargement but instead caused an increase in lymphoid aggregate formation.

Material and methods Cohort study among university students in Spain (n = 1382). BD and RC were measured with the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test at ages 18, 20, 22, 24 and 27 years. Multilevel logistic regression for repeated measures was used to calculate the adjusted Odds Ratios (ORs). Results The prevalence rates of RC and BD were lower throughout the study in students who did not follow these patterns of consumption at age 18. For RC and BD, the differences at age 27 years, expressed as percentage points (pp), were respectively 24 pp and 15 pp in women and 29 pp and 25 pp in men. Early age of onset of alcohol use increased the risk of engaging in RC and BD patterns at university, for men (OR = 2.91 & 2.80) and women (OR = 8.14 & 5.53). The same was observed in students living away from the parental home for BD (OR = 3.43 for men & 1.77 for women). Only women were influenced by having positive expectancies for engaging in RC (OR = 1.82) and BD (OR = 1.96). Conclusions The prevalence rates of both RC and BD at age 27 years were much higher among university students who already followed these patterns of consumption at age 18 years, with the differences being proportionally higher among women. Focusing on the age of onset of alcohol consumption and hindering access to alcohol by minors should be priority objectives aimed at preventing students from engaging in these patterns of alcohol consumption at university."
https://openalex.org/W2797896645,"The diversity and taxonomy of anodontine species in Lake Baikal and Transbaikalia region has been contentious since it is based on a typological species concept, the so called “Comparatory Method”.

This genus was separated from Anodonta based on shell characteristics and further split into two subgenera, i.e. Colletopterum sensu stricto and Colletopterum (Piscinaliana). However, many authors do not recognize this separation maintaining all Colletopterum forms within Anodonta.

https://openalex.org/W2796499147,"Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) has long been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). COX-2 is mostly known for the production of prostaglandins (PGs) from arachidonic acid. However, it also metabolizes the endocannabinoids 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) and anandamide into the less well-studied bioactive lipids PG-glycerol esters (PG-Gs) and PG-ethanolamides (PG-EAs or prostamides). We previously showed that PGD2-G, a product of 2-AG oxygenation by COX-2, has anti-inflammatory effects. Therefore, we used the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced model of colitis in mice to explore the role of PGD2-G in murine models of IBD. Colon inflammation was assessed using macroscopic and histologic scores, myeloperoxidase activity, and expression of inflammatory mediators by real-time quantitative PCR and ELISA. We also compared the effects of PGD2-G with those of PGD2 and PGD2-EA. Finally, we used receptor antagonists to gain mechanistic insight into the receptors responsible for the observed effects. PGD2-G reduced DSS-induced colitis, but PGD2 and PGD2-EA did not have the same effect. Furthermore, we showed that PGD2-G is an agonist of the PGD2 receptor 1 (DP1) and that some of the effects of PGD2-G were blocked by antagonism of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ and DP1. Therefore, PGD2-G could be one of the products from the COX-2/prostaglandin D synthase axis to exert beneficial effects in colitis.—Alhouayek, M., Buisseret, B., Paquot, A., Guillemot-Legris, O., Muccioli, G.

Here, we tested whether XJB-5-131 has beneficial effects in R6/2 mice, a severe early onset model of HD. We found that XJB-5-131 has beneficial effects in R6/2 mice, by delaying features of the motor and histological phenotype. The impact was sex-dependent, with a stronger effect in male mice. XJB-5-131 treatment improved some locomotor deficits in female R6/2 mice, but the effects were, in general, greater in male mice. Chronic treatment of male R6/2 mice with XJB-5-1-131 reduced weight loss, and improved the motor and temperature regulation deficits, especially in male mice. Treatment with XJB-5-131 had no effect on the lifespan of R6/2 mice. Nevertheless, it significantly slowed somatic expansion at 90 days, and reduced the density of inclusions. Our data show that while treatment with XJB-5-131 had complex effects on the phenotype of R6/2 mice, it produced a number of significant improvements in this severe model of HD."
https://openalex.org/W2797704312,"Objectives Increasing evidence suggests that inflammation has a detrimental effect on muscle strength. Our objective was to analyse the association between muscle performance and different disease activity levels in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Method A total of 199 consecutive outpatients were subject to cross-sectional assessment. Measurements of grip strength, endurance of the upper and lower limbs and trunk strength were combined as a muscle performance composite score (MPCS), using a standardised method. The disease activity for 28 joints (DAS28), radiographs of small joints (Larsen score), rheumatoid factor, body mass index (BMI), comorbidities and anti-rheumatic drugs were verified. Patients’ questionnaires included sociodemographic information, pain level, global disease activity, the Beck Depression Inventory, the mental and physical component scores of Short Form-36 and physical activity level. Results Of the 199 patients, 36%, 17% and 47% patients had remission, low/moderate and high DAS28, respectively. The patients in remission had significantly shorter disease duration, better parameters in terms of pain, physician’s assessment, Larsen, Beck or physical component score of Short Form-36, and they were more physically active than other patients. After adjustments for age, sex, RA duration, radiographs and BMI, the decreasing MPCS associated linearly with the increasing DAS28 activity levels (linearity, P <0.001). Conclusion Poorer MPCS is clearly associated with higher disease activity in patients with RA. Muscle performance is a modifiable risk factor. The findings suggest evaluating muscle performance in clinical practice as a part of patient care."
https://openalex.org/W2797952274,"Proven links between disability and poverty suggest that development programmes and policies that are not disability-inclusive will leave persons with disabilities behind. Despite this, there is limited quantitative evidence on livelihood opportunities amongst adults with disabilities in Low and Middle Income Countries. This study adds to the limited evidence base, contributing data from one African and one Asian Setting. We undertook a population-based case–control study of adults (18+) with and without disabilities in North-West Cameroon and in Telangana State, India. We found that adults with disabilities were five times less likely to be working compared to age-sex matched controls in both settings. Amongst adults with disabilities, current age, marital status and disability type were key predictors of working. Inclusive programmes are therefore needed to provide adequate opportunities to participate in livelihood prospects for adults with disabilities in Cameroon and India, on an equal basis as others. These findings are of crucial importance at this stage of the Sustainable Development Agenda, to ensure that the mandate of inclusive development is achieved."
https://openalex.org/W2797341671,"Background The clinical features of postoperative delirium are similar to the core features of alpha synuclein-related cognitive disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease dementia (PDD) or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Therefore, we hypothesized that the non-motor symptoms (NMSs) in Parkinson’s disease (PD), which precede the cardinal motor features of PD, are likely to be risk factors for developing postoperative delirium. We investigated the association between PD-related NMSs and postoperative delirium in old people undergoing elective spinal surgery. Methods This study was a prospective study. Participants were aged 65 years and older and scheduled to undergo elective spinal surgery. During the enrollment period, 338 individuals were screened, 104 participants were included in the analysis. We assessed eight easily-assessed and representative PD-related NMSs 1 day before the scheduled surgery using tests or questionnaires for each symptom. The presence of delirium was determined by using the short version of the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM). Results Fifteen (14.4%) of the 104 participants (age, 71.7 ± 4.7 years; men, 34.6%) met the CAM criteria for post-operative delirium. Multivariate logistic analysis showed that decreased olfactory function (odds ratio [OR] 0.63, 95% CI 0.44–0.91) and exhibiting rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD, OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.09–1.93) were significantly independent predictors of postoperative delirium. Conclusions Our study shows that hyposmia and RBD are significantly independent risk factors for postoperative delirium in general elderly population. Considering that NMSs may represent burden of alpha synuclein deposit, we postulate that an underlying alpha synucleinopathy may correlates with postoperative delirium. Significance This study gives a novel insight for the risk factor of postoperative delirium."
https://openalex.org/W2796635069,"The need to complete multiple tasks concurrently is a common occurrence both daily life and in occupational activities, which can often include simultaneous cognitive and physical demands. As one example, there is increasing availability of head-worn display technologies that can be employed when a user is mobile (e.g., while walking). This new method of information presentation may, however, introduce risks of adverse outcomes such as a decrement to gait performance. The goal of this study was thus to quantify the effects of a head-worn display (i.e., smart glasses) on motor variability during gait and to compare these effects with those of other common information displays (i.e., smartphone and paper-based system). Twenty participants completed four walking conditions, as a single task and in three dual-task conditions (three information displays). In the dual-task conditions, the information display was used to present several cognitive tasks. Three different measures were used to quantify variability in gait parameters for each walking condition (using the cycle-to-cycle standard deviation, sample entropy, and the ""goal-equivalent manifold"" approach). Our results indicated that participants used less adaptable gait strategies in dual-task walking using the paper-based system and smartphone conditions compared with single-task walking. Gait performance, however, was less affected during dual-task walking with the smart glasses. We conclude that the risk of an adverse gait event (e.g., a fall) in head-down walking conditions (i.e., the paper-based system and smartphone conditions) were higher than in single-task walking, and that head-worn displays might help reduce the risk of such events during dual-task gait conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2796822277,"Objective Azathioprine is a widely used immunosuppressive drug. Genetic polymorphisms and activity of the enzyme thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) have been associated with azathioprine efficacy and toxicity in several populations. We investigated whether these associations also exist for ANCA associated vasculitis (AAV) patients, who receive azathioprine maintenance therapy after remission induction with cyclophosphamide. Methods 207 AAV patients treated with cyclophosphamide induction and azathioprine maintenance therapy were included and followed for 60 months. TPMT genotype and tertiles of TPMT activity were compared to relapse free survival and occurrence of adverse events, particularly leukopenia. Multivariable regression was performed to account for confounders. Results In univariable analysis, relapse free survival was not significantly associated with TPMT genotype (P = 0.41) or TPMT activity (P = 0.07), although it tended to be longer in lower tertiles of TPMT activity. There was no significant association of TPMT genotype and activity with occurrence of any adverse event. In multiple regression, leukocyte counts at the end of cyclophosphamide induction were related to risk of leukopenia during azathioprine therapy [P<0.001; OR 0.54 (95% CI 0.43–0.68)] and risk of relapse during follow-up [P = 0.001; HR 1.17 (95% CI 1.07–1.29)] irrespective of TMPT genotype or activity. Conclusion TPMT genotype and activity were not independent predictors of relapse, and could not predict leukopenia or other adverse effects from azathioprine. Leukocyte counts after cyclophosphamide induction were related to both outcomes, implying a greater influence of cyclophosphamide response compared to azathioprine and TPMT in AAV patients."
https://openalex.org/W2796823410,"Total refractive astigmatism is usually the first consideration that guides the selection of contact lens type (e.g., spherical or toric), while the ocular source of the astigmatism is a second, but more important consideration, for the final clinical decision. This study was conducted to provide detailed data on this topic by evaluating astigmatic components in Chinese adolescents.Participants were recruited from healthy high school students undergoing an annual ocular examination at a local hospital. Total astigmatism (TA), corneal astigmatism (CA), and ocular residual astigmatism (ORA) were determined by a Hartmann-Shack wavefront analyzer system (KR-1W, Topcon) with the natural pupil. The axis relationship between CA and ORA was placed into three categories: on-axis, defined as an axis with a difference of 0 ± 10°; opposite-axis, a difference of 90 ± 10°; and the rest defined as oblique-axis.The study consisted of 1,466 students (57.84% girls, age: 16.49 ± 1.05 years). ORA was present in 83.97%, 66.64%, and 45.23% of participants, according to the various criteria for astigmatism (≥ 0.50 D, ≥ 0.75 D, and ≥ 1.00 D, respectively). While with-the-rule was the most common axis orientation for both TA (76.28%) and CA (89.94%), against-the-rule predominated in ORA (93.82%; χ2 = 1688.544, p < 0.001). Opposite-axis was the major type of axis difference (90.96%) of clinical significance (i.e., ≥ 1.00 D) between CA and ORA, which also prevailed in all levels of TA (range: 56.25-82.26%).ORA is common in high school students and usually demonstrates a compensation relationship with CA, which should be taken into consideration when determining the design of contact lenses to correct refractive error."
https://openalex.org/W2797271757,"Background In developing regions, an estimated 214 million women have an unmet need for family planning. Reaching Family Planning 2020 (FP2020) commitments will require a shift in modern contraceptive promotion, including improved access to long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs). Until now, a lack of market data limited understanding of the potential of LARCs to increase contraceptive access and choice. Methods From 2015, the FPwatch Project conducted representative surveys in Ethiopia, Nigeria, and Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) using a full census approach in selected administrative areas. In these areas, every public and private sector outlet with the potential to sell or distribute modern contraceptives was approached. In outlets with modern contraceptives, product audits and provider interviews assessed contraceptive market composition, market share, availability, price, and outlet readiness to perform services. Results Fifty-four percent of outlets in Ethiopia had LARC commodities or services available at the time of the survey, versus 7% and 8% of outlets in Nigeria and DRC, respectively. When present, LARCs were usually available with at least two other methods (99%, 39%, and 84% of public health facilities in Ethiopia, Nigeria and DRC, respectively). Many public facilities had both implants and IUDs in stock (76%, 47%, and 53%, respectively). Lack of readiness to provide LARCs was mostly due to a lack of equipment, private room, or the commodity itself. Market share for implants in the public sector was 60%, 53%, and 37% of Couple Years of Protection (CYP) in Ethiopia, Nigeria, and DRC. Discussion Limited availability of LARCs in Nigeria and DRC restricts contraceptive choice and makes it difficult for women to adopt and use modern contraception consistently. Brand-specific subsidies, task shifting, and promotion of methods that require less equipment and training are promising strategies for increasing uptake. Substantial government investment is required to improve availability and affordability. Investment in implants should be prioritized to make progress towards FP2020 commitments."
https://openalex.org/W2797935257,"Reliable measures of transmission intensities can be incorporated into metrics for monitoring disease-control interventions. Genetic (molecular) measures like multiplicity of infection (MOI) have several advantages compared with traditional measures, e.g., R0. Here, we investigate the properties of a maximum-likelihood approach to estimate MOI and pathogen-lineage frequencies. By verifying regulatory conditions, we prove asymptotical unbiasedness, consistency and efficiency of the estimator. Finite sample properties concerning bias and variance are evaluated over a comprehensive parameter range by a systematic simulation study. Moreover, the estimator’s sensitivity to model violations is studied. The estimator performs well for realistic sample sizes and parameter ranges. In particular, the lineage-frequency estimates are almost unbiased independently of sample size. The MOI estimate’s bias vanishes with increasing sample size, but might be substantial if sample size is too small. The estimator’s variance matrix agrees well with the Cramér-Rao lower bound, even for small sample size. The numerical and analytical results of this study can be used for study design. This is exemplified by a malaria data set from Venezuela. It is shown how the results can be used to determine the necessary sample size to achieve certain performance goals. An implementation of the likelihood method and a simulation algorithm for study design, implemented as an R script, is available as S1 File alongside a documentation (S2 File) and example data (S3 File)."

We sought to elucidate critical missed opportunities and barriers to care among adolescents hospitalized with HIV at Botswana’s tertiary referral hospital. We enrolled all HIV-infected adolescents (aged 10–19 years) hospitalized with any diagnosis other than pregnancy from July 2015 to January 2016. Medical records were reviewed for clinical variables and past engagement in care. Semi-structured interviews of the adolescents (when feasible) and their caregivers explored delays and barriers to care. Twenty-one eligible adolescents were identified and 15 were enrolled. All but one were WHO Clinical Stage 3 or 4. Barriers to diagnosis included lack of awareness about perinatal HIV infection, illness or death of the mother, and fear of discrimination. Barriers to adherence to antiretroviral therapy included nondisclosure, isolation, and mental health concerns. The number of hospitalized HIV-infected adolescents was lower than expected. However, among those hospitalized, the lack of timely diagnosis and subsequent gaps in the care cascade elucidated opportunities to improve outcomes and quality of life for this vulnerable group."

It documents that giant ichthyosaurs persisted well into the Rhaetian Stage, and close to the time of the Late Triassic extinction event. This specimen has prompted the reinterpretation of several large, roughly cylindrical bones from the latest Triassic (Rhaetian Stage) Westbury Mudstone Formation from Aust Cliff, Gloucestershire, UK. We argue here that the Aust bones, previously identified as those of dinosaurs or large terrestrial archosaurs, are jaw fragments from giant ichthyosaurs. The Lilstock and Aust specimens might represent the largest ichthyosaurs currently known."
https://openalex.org/W2797558837,"Exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD) is associated with impaired muscle function and reduced neuromuscular recruitment. However, motor unit firing behaviour throughout the recovery period is unclear. EIMD impairment of maximal voluntary force (MVC) will, in part, be caused by reduced high-threshold motor unit firing, which will subsequently increase to recover MVC. Fourteen healthy active males completed a bout of eccentric exercise on the knee extensors, with measurements of MVC, rate of torque development and surface electromyography performed pre-exercise and 2, 3, 7 and 14 days post-exercise, on both damaged and control limb. EIMD was associated with decreased MVC (235.2 ± 49.3 Nm vs. 161.3 ± 52.5 Nm; p <0.001) and rate of torque development (495.7 ± 136.9 Nm.s-1 vs. 163.4 ± 163.7 Nm.s-1; p <0.001) 48h post-exercise. Mean motor unit firing rate was reduced (16.4 ± 2.2 Hz vs. 12.6 ± 1.7 Hz; p <0.01) in high-threshold motor units only, 48h post-exercise, and common drive was elevated (0.36 ± 0.027 vs. 0.56 ± 0.032; p< 0.001) 48h post-exercise. The firing rate of high-threshold motor units was reduced in parallel with impaired muscle function, whilst early recruited motor units remained unaltered. Common drive of motor units increased in offset to the firing rate impairment. These alterations correlated with the recovery of force decrement, but not of pain elevation. This study provides fresh insight into the central mechanisms associated with EIMD recovery, relative to muscle function. These findings may in turn lead to development of novel management and preventative procedures."
https://openalex.org/W2797589122,"Background The optimal performance of a notifiable disease surveillance system (NDSS) is dependent on health care provider (HCP) compliance with communicable disease notification. HCP compliance ensures appropriate investigation and control measures by relevant health care authorities. This study examines the compliance of HCPs with the NDSS in South Africa and factors associated with their compliance. Methods A cross-sectional survey was carried out in three randomly selected provinces. We stratified by type of facility, and recruited clusters of HCPs on survey day to participate. All consenting HCPs in the randomly selected health care facilities on the day of the survey, completed a questionnaire that elicited information on socio-demographic characteristics and notification practices. The data were analysed using STATA® 14, using the identifiers for stratum and cluster as well as the calculated sampling weights. Results The study found that 58% of 919 HCPs diagnosed a notifiable disease in the year preceding the survey. The majority of these professionals (92%) indicated that they had reported the disease, but only 51% of those notified the disease/s correctly to the Department of Health. Paediatricians were less likely to notify correctly (OR 0.01, 95% CI 0.00–0.12, p = 0.001). The factors that influenced notification were HCPs perceptions of workload (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.70–0.99, p = 0.043) and that notification data are not useful (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.71–0.99, p = 0.040). The study found no association between correct notification and HCPs’ willingness to notify, experience or training on the NDSS, understanding of the purpose of the NDSS, knowledge of what to notify, or perception of feedback given. Conclusions The compliance of HCPs in South Africa with the NDSS is suboptimal. In light of the important role of HCPs in the effective functioning of the NDSS, information on NDSS usefulness and guidelines on correct notification procedures are needed to increase their compliance."
https://openalex.org/W2797637107,"We have designed a complete antibody-like construct where the CH1 and Cκ domains are exchanged for a pair of the CH3 domains and efficient pairing of the heavy and light variable domain is achieved using “Knobs-into-Holes” strategy. This construct, composed of only naturally occurring immunoglobulin sequences without artificial linkers, expressed at a high level in mammalian cells, however exhibited low solubility. Rational mutagenesis aimed at the amino acid residues located at the interface of the variable domains and the exchanged CH3 domains was applied to improve the biophysical properties of the molecule. The domain-exchanged construct, including variable domains of the HER2/neu specific antibody trastuzumab, was able to bind to the surface of the strongly HER2/neu positive cell line SK-BR3 4-fold weaker than trastuzumab, but could nevertheless incite a more potent response in an antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC) reporter assay with FcγRIIIa-overexpressing T-cells. This could be explained with a stronger binding to the FcγRIIIa. Importantly, the novel construct could mediate a specific ADCC effect with natural killer cells similar to the parental antibody."
https://openalex.org/W2796668491,"Succulent cacti (Cactaceae) are among the most threatened taxonomic groups assessed to date. Here we evaluated the genetic diversity and population structure of a narrow endemic columnar cactus Pilosocereus aureispinus. This species is only found in a small area of c. 300 km2 of rocky savanna from eastern Brazil and it is currently classified as vulnerable (VU) on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red list. Eight microsatellite loci were genotyped for 91 individuals from four localities of the known P. aureispinus range. In contrast with expectations for narrow endemic species, we found relatively high levels of genetic diversity (e.g., HE = 0.390 to 0.525; HO = 0.394 to 0.572) and very low population structure based on the variation of six loci. All the analyzed individuals were clustered in one unique genetic group in assignment tests. We also generated the sequences of two plastid markers (trnT-trnL and psbD-trnT) and found no variation on a subsample of 39 individuals. We used Landsat 8 images and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index to estimate a potential extent of occurrence of c. 750 km2 for this species. Our results showed that P. aureispinus is not suffering from erosion of nuclear genetic variability due to its narrow distribution. However, we advocate that because of the extremely limited extent of occurrence, the ongoing anthropogenic disturbances in its habitat, and phylogenetic distinctiveness of P. aureispinus, this species should be classified as endangered (EN) on the IUCN Red List."

We conducted a case-control study with 100 patients and 100 controls subjects. We extracted DNA from blood samples,amplified the target DNA fragmentby PCR, and identifiedpolymorphisms through sequencing. We observed that the allelic and genotypic frequencies of rs74315341 and rs879255525 were associated with glaucoma in our patient population. The polymorphism atrs74315341 led to the substitutionof serine for arginine,whereas the polymorphism at rs879255525 led to the substitution ofasparagine for lysine. The haplotype TGAAGCCATTTC was associated with disease onset, whereas the haplotype GGAAGCCATTTC was protective against disease development. In conclusion, weidentified MYOC gene polymorphisms in susceptible regions that were associated withglaucoma onset among the Lahore patient population.This is the first report to identify a novel mutation in rs879255525 in exon 3 of the MYOC genethat is associated withglaucoma."
https://openalex.org/W2797606311,"Nearly half of HIV-positive patients experience mental health and substance use problems, but many do not receive adequate or ongoing mental health or addiction care. This lack of ongoing care can result in the use of costly acute care services. Prospective evaluations of the relationship between psychiatric and substance use disorders and acute care services use are lacking, and this information is needed to understand unmet needs and improve access to appropriate services.We conducted a secondary data analysis from a multicenter, longitudinal, prospective cohort study (n = 3,482 adults) between October 1, 2007 and March 31, 2013. We used explanatory extended Cox proportional hazard regression models to examine the impact of current depression and recreational drug use on acute care services use, and to explore whether current depression and recreational drug use were associated with potentially avoidable acute care services use.Over our 5.5 year study period, HIV-positive participants with current depression-only (aHR [95% CI]:1.2[1.1-1.4]), recreational drug use-only (1.3[1.1-1.6]), or co-occurring depression and recreational drug use (1.4[1.2-1.7]) were associated with elevated hazard of emergency department (ED) encounters compared to participants without these conditions. Over half of ED encounters were potentially avoidable. Participants with current depression-only (1.3[1.1-1.5];1.3[1.03-1.6]), recreational drug use-only (1.3[1.04-1.6];1.5[1.1-1.9]), or co-occurring depression and recreational drug use (1.3[1.04-1.7];1.4[1.06-1.9]) were associated with elevated hazard of low-acuity or repeated ED encounters respectively.We found a significant increase in ED services use and potentially avoidable ED encounters (including low-acuity or repeated ED encounters), particularly among those with either current depression or recreational drug use. These findings emphasize the challenges in managing HIV and mental health/addiction co-morbidities in the current HIV care model. Future research should evaluate integrated and collaborative care programs for improving the coordination of care and effectively treat mental health and addiction problems among HIV-positive patients in Ontario."

According to the presence of elastic lamina (EL) and elastic lamina invasion (ELI), all cases were divided into four groups: pT3 EL negative (pT3 EL (-)), pT3 ELI positive (pT3 ELI (+)), pT3 ELI negative (pT3 ELI (-)) and pT4a. Statistical analysis was used to analyze the relationship between elastic lamina invasion and other established adverse histologic features.The EL and ELI positive rates were 81.5% and 42.1% respectively. There were significant differences in mph node metastasis, venous invasion and tumor buds between pT3 ELI (-) and pT3 ELI (+), pT3 ELI (-) and pT4a. There was no significant difference in same factors between pT3 ELI (+) and pT4a. In pT3 stage, there were significant differences in lymph node metastasis, perineural invasion and tumor buds between EL (-) and ELI (+). There were no significant differences in same factors between EL (-) and ELI (-). EL was detected less frequently in right-sided tumors compared with left-sided tumors.ELI might be the prognostic factors of colon cancer with II stage and might be the marker of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients with pT3 ELI (+) might have similar prognosis to patients with pT4a. For patients with pT3 colon cancer, EL(-) might have similar prognosis as ELI (-) and might take the same therapy. In addition, the right half colon EL positive rate was lower than the left colon. Elastic staining might be a useful tool to help determine the invasive depth and stage of colon cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2796511578,"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) not only performs its basic function of regulating calcium homeostasis, lipid biosynthesis, folding, modifying and transporting proteins but also plays a decisive role in regulating multiple cellular processes ranging from cell growth and differentiation to apoptosis and autophagy. Disturbances in ER homeostasis initiate the unfolded protein response (UPR) implicated in the pathogenesis of many human diseases. Drugging the UPR components for therapeutic interventions has received considerable attention. The purpose of this study is to identify genes that are previously unsuspected to be regulated under ER stress. Because ER stress-inducible gene expression is majorly regulated under ERSE elements, we screened human genome by adopting an in silico approach using ERSE elements (I, II, III) as probes and identified 337 candidate genes. Having knowledge of the importance of E3 ubiquitin ligase in the ERAD machinery; we validated our preliminary search by focusing on one of the hits i.e. ASB7 gene that encodes E3 ubiquitin ligase. In HeLa cells, we found that pharmacological induction of ER stress led to an increase in the expression of ASB7 with simultaneous activation of UPR pathways. Although knockdown of ASB7 expression leads to significant reduction in GRP78 and CHOP mRNA levels, it did not protect cells from ER stress-induced cell death. Also, an up-regulation in the expression of pro-inflammatory genes like TNF-α and IL-1β in ASB7 knockdown cells was observed under ER stress. Collectively, our findings suggest that ASB7 is regulated under ER stress and this study also identifies several other genes that could apparently be regulated under ER stress."
https://openalex.org/W2796644749,"Statins have been known to increase the risk of incident type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM); however, other factors, especially hypertension, are also associated with DM development.We investigated whether statin use increases the risk of DM and further analyzed whether the relation between statin use and incident DM differs according to the presence of hypertension and gender.From a nationwide health-screening cohort, 40,164 participants with total cholesterol levels ≥eve mg/dL and without pre-diagnosed DM, cardiovascular disease, or cancer, who underwent a series of regular health check-ups, were enrolled. Statin users were defined as participants who were prescribed statins more than twice during 6 months.There were 17,798 statin non-users and 22,366 statin users. During 7.66±3.21 years of follow-up, incident DM developed in 5.68% of statin non-users and 7.64% of statin users. Among the entire study population, statin use was associated with new-onset DM after adjusting for clinical risk factors. In sub-analysis according to hypertension, statin use significantly increased the risk of incident DM only in normotensive patients [hazard ratio (HR) 1.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09 to 1.58, p = 0.004], and not in hypertensive patients (p>0.05). Furthermore, continuous statin use was strongly associated with new-onset DM in women, regardless of hypertension presence (all p<0.05). However, in men, statin was associated with new-onset DM only in normotensive males (HR 1.61, 95% CI 1.35 to 1.92, p<0.001) and not in hypertensive males (p>0.05).Statin use increased the risk of new-onset DM only in normotensive patients and hypertensive women, suggesting that these groups should be more carefully monitored for the development of DM during the course of follow-up."
https://openalex.org/W2796710158,"Objective To evaluate the learnability and feasibility of a new technique comprising a needle-guidance-system (NGS) for ultrasound-assisted lumbar puncture. Method Using a randomized crossover study design, 24 medical students were asked to perform an ultrasound-assisted lumbar puncture on a gel phantom using two different techniques that each included a paramedian insertion site. Procedure 1 (P1) used a pre-procedural ultrasound scan to predetermine the ideal insertion point. Procedure 2 (P2) applied a new technique comprising an NGS for performing real-time ultrasound-guided lumbar puncture. Success rates and performance times for both procedures were compared. Participants were also asked to complete a post-study questionnaire, both to quantitatively assess the workload involved and state their personal preferences. Results In comparison to the pre-procedural scan (P1), the NGS (P2) was associated with a significant increase in the number of successful punctures per participant (5 (P2) [interquartile range: 3.3–5.0] vs. 3 (P1) [interquartile range: 1.3–4.0], p = 0.005), and led to a significant reduction in performance time (118 seconds vs. 80.6 seconds, p < 0.001). In terms of workload perception, NGS use was associated with significantly better performances and lower frustration levels, as rated by students in the post-study questionnaire. Finally, 23/24 participants stated their preference for P2. Conclusion Our newly-developed technique for real-time ultrasound-guided lumbar puncture proved to be learnable and feasible for novices, and only required a small amount of training. The use of an NGS therefore has the potential to serve as a key feature of the ultrasound-assisted lumbar puncture."
https://openalex.org/W2797139525,"Accurate demand forecasting for new technology products is a key factor in the success of a business. We propose a way to forecasting a new product’s diffusion through technology diffusion and interest diffusion. Technology diffusion and interest diffusion are measured by the volume of patent citations and web search traffic, respectively. We apply the proposed method to forecast the sales of hybrid cars and industrial robots in the US market. The results show that that technology diffusion, as represented by patent citations, can explain long-term sales for hybrid cars and industrial robots. On the other hand, interest diffusion, as represented by web search traffic, can help to improve the predictability of market sales of hybrid cars in the short-term. However, interest diffusion is difficult to explain the sales of industrial robots due to the different market characteristics. Finding indicates our proposed model can relatively well explain the diffusion of consumer goods."
https://openalex.org/W2796866983,"The CDC Tier 1 select agent Francisella tularensis is a small, Gram-negative bacterium and the causative agent of tularemia, a potentially life-threatening infection endemic in the United States, Europe and Asia. Currently, there is no licensed vaccine or rapid point-of-care diagnostic test for tularemia. The purpose of this research was to develop monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific to the F. tularensis surface-expressed lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for a potential use in a rapid diagnostic test. Our initial antigen capture ELISA was developed using murine IgG3 mAb 1A4. Due to the low sensitivity of the initial assay, IgG subclass switching, which is known to have an effect on the functional affinity of a mAb, was exploited for the purpose of enhancing assay sensitivity. The ELISA developed using the IgG1 or IgG2b mAbs from the subclass-switch family of 1A4 IgG3 yielded improved assay sensitivity. However, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) demonstrated that the functional affinity was decreased as a result of subclass switching. Further investigation using direct ELISA revealed the potential self-association of 1A4 IgG3, which could explain the higher functional affinity and higher assay background seen with this mAb. Additionally, the higher assay background was found to negatively affect assay sensitivity. Thus, enhancement of the assay sensitivity by subclass switching is likely due to the decrease in assay background, simply by avoiding the self-association of IgG3."
https://openalex.org/W2798229154,"Phenylephrine is an α1 adrenergic receptor agonist that causes pulmonary vasoconstriction, and so may effectively enhance hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV). However, there is little evidence that phenylephrine augments HPV in clinical situations. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical effects of phenylephrine infusion on oxygenation during one-lung ventilation (OLV) in patients undergoing thoracic surgery.This was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, cross-over study. Included patients were those undergoing elective thoracic surgery in the lateral decubitus position with OLV. Patients were randomly allocated to two groups. The N-P group initially had OLV with normal saline infusion for 30 minutes; after a 10 minute interval, OLV was then maintained with phenylephrine infusion for 30 minutes. The P-N group had the drug-infusion in the reverse order. The primary outcome was arterial partial pressure of oxygen. Secondary outcomes were mean arterial pressure, heart rate, pulse pressure variation, perfusion index, and difference between bladder and skin temperature. Statistical analysis was performed using the student t-test, Fisher's exact test, and ANOVA for Cross-over design. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.Twenty-nine patients were analyzed. Although phenylephrine infusion significantly increased mean arterial pressure (P < 0.001), arterial partial pressure of oxygen did not differ between the two timepoints (P = 0.19). There was no carryover effect in arterial partial pressure of oxygen (P = 0.14). Phenylephrine infusion significantly decreased heart rate (P = 0.02) and pulse pressure variation (P < 0.001).Phenylephrine infusion did not improve oxygenation during OLV. The present results indicate that phenylephrine does not have clinically meaningful effects on HPV.University Hospital Medical Information Network 000024317."
https://openalex.org/W2796978195,"An increased prevalence of the inflammatory bowel diseases, ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease, was found amongst residents in a livestock dense area. We hypothesised that exposure to livestock farms might be a substantial environmental factor that contributes to the development of these diseases and that in the lead up to inflammatory bowel diseases potential risk factors can be identified. This study aimed to investigate the contribution of livestock exposure to the development of these diseases and the clinical events prior to the diagnosis. Electronic health records from 2006–2013 of general practices were used. The study population consisted of patients with a new diagnosis of inflammatory bowel diseases resident in areas with a high (n = 141) or lower (n = 109) livestock density. Patients with low back pain (n = 10,469) were used as controls. For those in a livestock dense area, distance to livestock farms was determined. Associations between morbidities and drug prescriptions in the reporting year and three years previous to the diagnosis, and the residential proximity to livestock exposure were investigated with multivariable logistic regression analyses. Acute and chronic morbidity of the gastrointestinal tract and associated drug prescriptions were predictive for the development of inflammatory bowel diseases. In addition, a positive association was found between infections and living within 500 meter of poultry farms and the development of inflammatory bowel diseases [OR: 3.3 (1.1–9.9)]. Nonetheless, overall livestock exposure contributed little to the development of these diseases. These results suggest that exposure to livestock farms on its own contributes minimal to the development of inflammatory bowel diseases. Nonetheless, having infections appeared to be a risk factor for neighbouring residents of poultry farms. More research is warranted to explain the increased prevalence of inflammatory bowel diseases amongst residents in areas with a high density of livestock."
https://openalex.org/W2797192498,"Currently, in Belgium, bevacizumab is reimbursed for ovarian cancer patients, based on a contract between the Minister and the manufacturer including confidential agreements. This reimbursement will be re-evaluated in 2018.To support the reimbursement reassessment by calculating the cost-effectiveness of bevacizumab: (1) in addition to first-line chemotherapy; (2) in the treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer (platinum-sensitive or platinum-resistant).A health economic model has been developed for the Belgian situation according to the Belgian guidelines for economic evaluations. The lifetime Markov model was set up from the perspective of the health care payer (government and patient), including direct healthcare related costs. Results are expressed as the extra costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Calculations were based on results of four international trials. Both probabilistic and one-way sensitivity analyses were performed.Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of first-line bevacizumab are on average 158 000/QALY (GOG-0218 trial) and 443 000/QALY (ICON7 trial). The most favourable scenario is based on the stage IV subgroup of the GOG-0218 trial (€52 000/QALY). Since subgroup findings are often exploratory and require confirmatory studies, results of the economic evaluation based on this subgroup analysis should be considered with caution. For second-line bevacizumab, ICERs are on average €587 000/QALY (OCEANS trial) and €172 000/QALY (AURELIA trial). Sensitivity analysis shows that results are most sensitive to the price of bevacizumab.From a health economic perspective, ICERs of bevacizumab are relatively high. The most favourable results are found for first-line treatment of stage IV ovarian cancer patients. Price reductions have a major impact on the estimated ICERs. It is recommended to take these findings into account when re-evaluating the reimbursement of bevacizumab in ovarian cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2797891048,"To evaluate the quality of pediatric anesthesia in a university hospital in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.A cross-sectional study conducted using a new tool that was developed from the literature and WHO recommendations including 28 parameters as standards for pediatric anesthesia. These 28 parameters consisted of 17 structure parameters of the equipment and medicines that should be present in theatre before any surgery starts, and 11 process parameters of actions taken by staff. Adverse events occurring during the anesthesia were recorded.30 patients were included, aged between 1.5 months to 5 years with a mean of 2.4 years. 26 of the patients underwent elective surgery and 4 patients emergency surgery. Nine parameters were always present and one parameter (bag and mask) was not available for any of the patients. The structure index ranged from 71% to 94% with a mean of 84%. The process index had a mean score of 71% with a range from 50% to 90%: lower than the structure index (p<0.001). With the structure and process index combined the average score was 79% with a low of 67% and high of 89%. 70 adverse events were observed with a range from 0 to 7 adverse events per patient. The most common adverse event was hypoxia at extubation in 20 (69%) patients. Nine patients had an episode of severe hypoxia at extubation.Pediatric anesthesia in low resource settings suffers from deficiencies in the structures and processes of providing good quality care. Improvement efforts may be best focused on improving the consistency and quality of the process of care and a reduction in adverse events rather than the structures available. Use of the assessment tool developed for this research could be useful for systematic quality-improvement efforts and to assess the needs in different settings."
https://openalex.org/W2797983892,"Based on extensive Langevin Dynamics simulations we investigate the structural properties of a two-dimensional ensemble of magnetic rods with a peapod-like morphology, i.e, rods consisting of aligned single dipolar beads. Self-assembled configurations are studied for different directions of the dipole with respect to the rod axis. We found that with increasing misalignment of the dipole from the rod axis, the smaller the packing fraction at which the percolation transition is found. For the same density, the system exhibits different aggregation states for different misalignment. We also study the stability of the percolated structures with respect to temperature, which is found to be affected by the microstructure of the assembly of rods."
https://openalex.org/W2797385758,"Many physical simulations aim at evaluating the net interaction between two rigid bodies, resulting from the cumulative effect of pairwise interactions between their constituents. This is manifested particularly in biomolecular applications such as hierarchical protein folding instances where the interaction between almost rigid domains directly influences the folding pathway, the interaction between macromolecules for drug design purposes, self-assembly of nanoparticles for drug design and drug delivery, and design of smart materials and bio-sensors. In general, the brute force approach requires quadratic (in terms of the number of particles) number of pairwise evaluation operations for any relative pose of the two bodies, unless simplifying assumptions lead to a collapse of the computational complexity. We propose to approximate the pairwise interaction function using a linear predictor function, in which the basis functions have separated forms, i.e. the variables that describe local geometries of the two rigid bodies and the ones that reflect the relative pose between them are split in each basis function. Doing so replaces the quadratic number of interaction evaluations for each relative pose with a one-time quadratic computation of a set of characteristic parameters at a preprocessing step, plus constant number of pose function evaluations at each pose, where this constant is determined by the required accuracy of approximation as well as the efficiency of the used approximation method. We will show that the standard deviation of the error for the net interaction is linearly (in terms of number of particles) proportional to the regression error, if the regression errors are from a normal distribution. Our results show that proper balance of the tradeoff between accuracy and speed-up yields an approximation which is computationally superior to other existing methods while maintaining reasonable precision."
