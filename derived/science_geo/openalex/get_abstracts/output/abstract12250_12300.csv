Observations by infrared transillumination in the exposed heart and in the brain in cephalo without surgical intervention show that oxygen sufficiency for cytochrome a,a3, function, changes in tissue blood volume, and the average hemoglobin-oxyhemoglobin equilibrium can be recorded effectively and in continuous fashion for research and clinical purposes. The copper atom associated with heme a3 did not respond to anoxia and may be reduced under normoxic conditions, whereas the heme-a copper was at least partially reducible."

Gap junctions (low resistance pathways) were only present during or immediately prior to delivery and immediately postpartum. The absence of gap junctions during gestation may be necessary for maintenance of pregnancy, while their occurrence during parturition may lead to effective termination of pregnancy."

https://openalex.org/W2019219354,"The effects of fenfluramine and other sanorectic drugs on the consumption of both protein and total calories by rats given simultaneous access to two isocaloric diets containing 5 or 45 percent casein were examined. Anorectic doses of fenfluramine failed to decrease protein intake but increased the proportion of total dietary calories represented by protein. In contrast, anorectic doses of d-amphetamine decreased protein and calorie consumption proportionately. Subanorectic doses of fenfluramine also increased the proportion of caloric intake represented by protein among animals given prior treatment with the serotonin precursor tryptophan. Fluoxetine, a drug that blocks reuptake of serotonin, similarly spared protein consumption while reducing caloric intake. These observations indicate that two distinct brain mechanisms, sensitive to different drugs, underlie the elective consumption of protein and calories."

https://openalex.org/W2047896991,Intracellular glucopenia induced by 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) administration in man produces increased hunger ratings and magnitude estimates of pleasantness for sucrose solutions. Augmented food intake substantiates these changes in affective behavior and relieves experimentally induced hunger. Intracellular glucopenia activates counterregulatory mechanisms to raise plasma glucose concentrations. Inducing hunger experimentally with 2DG provides a useful method for studying appetitive behavior in humans. The neurohumoral control of pituitary hormone release and other hypothalamic functions may be examined after 2DG infusion.
https://openalex.org/W1584261210,"Ribonuclease III from Escherichia coli has been purified to apparent homogeneity by affinity chromatography on immobilized double-stranded RNA. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified enzyme in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate gave one band of protein with a molecular weight of approximately 25,000. Chromatography on Sephadex G-100 is consistent with a molecular weight of 50,000, suggesting that the native enzyme is a dimer. RNase III cuts some single-stranded RNAs, such as bacteriophage T7 early RNA, at specific sites in vivo. This RNA is cut as these same sites by the purified enzyme under all conditions tested. However, at low ionic strength relatively small increases in enzyme concentration produce cuts as secondary sites. At high ionic strength, the enzyme's preference for the sites cut in vivo is more pronounced and secondary cuts are made only at very high enzyme concentrations. Secondary cuts are shown to occur at specific sites and are made in a variety of RNAs even from sources other than E. coli. By cutting RNAs at secondary sites it should be possible to generate RNA fragments which would be useful in a number of studies."
https://openalex.org/W1607597524,"Human hemoglobin was characterized as an enzyme in a reconstituted aniline hydroxylase system containing hemoglobin, NADPH, rat liver cytochrome P-450 reductase, aniline and atmospheric O2. This system catalyzed p-aminophenol formation (turnover number 0.2 mol/min/mol of hemoglobin) with an efficiency similar to that which has been reported for either microsomal cytochrome P-450 or cytochrome P-450 solubilized from rat liver. The rate of the reaction was linearly dependent on hemoglobin concentration up to approximately 1 nmol of hemoglobin/ml. This linear range of hemoenzyme concentration is also similar to cytochrome P-450-catalyzed reactions. Unlike the cytochrome P-450 system, the hemoglobin system did not require a lipid cofactor for maximal activity, and much less reductase was needed for maximal activity. Aniline displayed typical Michaelis-Menten saturation kinetics as substrate, and its Km (8 mM) was the same in the absence of presence of the reductase. Catalase essentially completely inhibited p-aminophenol formation in the absence or presence of reductase. In contrast, superoxide dismutase inhibited the reductase-mediated reaction only to a small extent (if at all). No detectable hydrogen peroxide accumulated during the course of the reaction in the absence of catalase. These findings suggested a hypothetical mechanism for hemoglobin-catalyzed hydroxylation of aniline involving a hemoglobin-bound form of hydrogen peroxide (aniline-Hb3+-OOH-) as an intermediate preceding the rate-determining formation of products."
https://openalex.org/W1583976285,"Galactosyltransferase, which functions as the catalytic component of lactose synthase and in the glycosylation of glycoproteins, has been previously reported to have an absolute dependence on Mn2+ for activity, with a Kd for Mn2+ (10(-3) M) 2 to 3 orders of magnitude greater than the physiological range of Mn2+ concentrations (v 10(-6) M). Reinvestigation of the metal ion dependence of this enzyme has shown that Zn2+, Cd2+, Fe2+, Co2+, and Pr3+ also produce activation, although with lower activities at saturation than that attained with Mn2+. Velocity against metal ion concentration curves for all metals, including Mn2+, are sigmoid, suggesting the presence of two or more activating metal binding sites on the enzyme. The presence of two sites is confirmed by studies using both Mn2+ and Ca2+. While galactosyltransferase is inactive in the presence of Ca2+ alone, at low concentrations of Mn2+ (10(-5) M), enzyme activity is stimulated by Ca2+. A more detailed investigation by steady state kinetics has revealed that there is a tight binding site for Mn2+ (site I: Kd of 2 X 10(-6) M) from which Ca2+ is excluded, and a site at which Ca2+ can replace Mn2+ (site II: Kd for Ca2+ of 1.76 X 10(-3) M), to which metal binding has a specific synergistic effect on UDP-galactose binding, possibly as a result of the formation of an enzyme-Ca2+-UDP-galactose bridge complex. The site I Mn2+, site II Ca2+-activated enzyme has a maximum velocity similar to that of the Mn2+-activated enzyme, and is the enzyme form that must act in lactose synthesis in vivo. A trypsin-degraded form of galactose transferase (galactosyltransferase-T) (Powell, J.T., and Brew, K. (1974) Eur. J. Biochem. 48, 217-228) appears to lack site I and is activated by Ca2+ in the absence of Mn2+."
https://openalex.org/W1542479042,"The activation of ATP equilibrium Pi exchange, ITP equilibrium Pi exchange, and the degree of phosphorylation of the membrane of sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles by ATP, ITP, and Pi were compared under different experimental conditions. In media containing 0.1 mM CaCl2, 6 mM Pi, and 4 mM ATP, during the period of Ca2+ accumulation the rate of ATP equilibrium Pi exchange was very low and the level of membrane phosphorylation by ATP was about 10-fold higher than the level of membrane phosphorylation by Pi. When net Ca2+ accumulation ceased and the Ca2+ concentration of the assay media had fallen to less than 5 muM, the degree of membrane phosphorylation by ATP decreased 4-fold and both the level of membrane phosphorylation by Pi and the rate of ATP equilibrium Pi exchange increase 4- to 6-fold. Contrasting with these data, when ATP was replaced by ITP, the rate of ITP equilibrium Pi exchange and the level of membrane phosphorylation by Pi were already high during the period of Ca2+ accumulation and varied slightly when the Ca2+ concentration of the incubation medium decreased to less than 5 muM. During the period of Ca2+ accumulation, the degree of membrane phosphorylation by Pi varied inversely with the NTP or NDP concentration of the medium, ATP and ADP being more effective than ITP and IDP in inhibiting the membrnae phosphorylation by Pi. Leaky vesicles incubated in media containing a high Ca2+ concentration were still able to catalyze both ATP equilibrium Pi and ITP equilibrium Pi exchange. Although the membrane of leaky vesicle was amply phosphorylated by Pi in media containing 0.1 nM CaCl2 and ITP, a significant rate of ITP equilibrium Pi exchange could only be measured in Ca2+ concentrations higher than 0.5 mM. The Ca2+ concentration required for half-maximal activation of the rate of either ITP equilibrium Pi or ATP equilibrium Pi exchange in leaky vesicles was found to be in the range of 1 to 2 mM. In leaky vesicles, the apparent Km of Pi for the ITP equilibrium Pi exchange was at least 1 order of magnitude lower than for the ATP equilibrium Pi exchange."

https://openalex.org/W2156106047,"Protein degradation occurs more rapidly in senescent WI-38 cultures than in phase II cultures or in SV-40 transformed WI-38 cells (VA-13). The first differences are found in early phase III, when short lived but not long lived proteins are degraded more rapidly. At the end of phase III long lived proteins are also degraded more rapidly as shown by both intermittent perfusion and approach to equilibrium methods. By both methods the rates of protein degradation for the virally transformed derivative are the same as those for phase II WI-38, implying that transformation has not altered these characteristics of protein degradation. WI-38 cells incorporate canavanine, an analog of arginine, into protein. This analog, as well as p-fluorophenylalanine and azetidine carboxylic acid, accelerates the degradation of proteins labeled with [3H]leucine in their presence but does not alter the degradation rates of proteins prelabeled with [14C]leucine in the absence of the analogs. These results imply that the analogs increase the intracellular degradation rates of proteins because they render them more susceptible to the degradative system. Late phase III WI-38 cells may not selectively catabolize proteins containing canavanine as rapidly as do phase II and VA-13 cells. These results imply that the phase III protein degradative system becomes partially defective, thereby losing its ability to rapidly catabolize altered protein which leads to increased levels of abnormal proteins and decreased cell function."
https://openalex.org/W1515879379,"The conjugation of glycine to benzoates and the conjugation of L-glutamine to certain arylacetates are catalyzed by two different acyl-CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferases which can be purified separately from liver mitochondrial fractions of either rhesus monkey or man. In both species, one transferase is specific for glycine and the other for L-glutamine. The glycine enzyme utilizes either butyryl-CoA or benzoyl-CoA as acyl donors while the glutamine enzyme uses either phenylacetyl-CoA or indoleacetyl-CoA. Acyl-CoA substrates for one transferase do not serve as substrates for the other. Additional studies with the monkey liver enzymes revealed that acyl-CoA substrates for one transferase inhibit the other, that the apparent Km value is low (10(-6) to 10(-5) M range) for the preferred acyl-CoA substrate as compared to the amino acid acceptor (greater than 10(-2) M) and that both transferases have a molecular weight of approximately 24,000. Hippuric acid and either phenylacetylglutamine or indoleacetylglutamine were characterized as the products formed by the separate enzymes."

https://openalex.org/W1495182961,"Two brush border peptidases have been isolated from the particulate fraction of the rat intestinal mucosa and purified to homogeneity as judged by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, starch gel electrophoresis, isoelectric focusing, and double immunodiffusion. For convenience, the peptidases have been designated peptidase F (fast) and S (slow) on the basis of their anodic mobilities. The isoelectric point of peptidase F was 4.76 and of peptidase S, 5.10. Both enzymes are glycoproteins. The amino acid compositions of the two peptidases are similar. The same carbohydrates are found in both enzymes, but there are differences in the molar concentrations of individual sugars. Peptidase S has greater concentrations of mannose and galactose and of hexosamines than peptidase F, while sialic acid is slightly greater in peptidase F. Carbohydrate accounted for approximately 19% and 23% of the weight of peptidases F and S, respectively. Estimates of the molecular weights of both enzymes by gel filtration gave values of 280,000. Electrophoresis of the enzymes under denaturing conditions on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels indicated that each enzyme is a dimer consisting of two subunits of equal molecular weight, 140,000."
https://openalex.org/W1581065702,"The substitution of lanthanide ions for Ca(II) in the Ca(II)-binding sites of prothrombin and the derivatives of prothrombin activation and in the metal-dependent conversion of prothrombin or prethrombin 1 to thrombin was studied at pH 6.8. Gd(III), Tb(III), La(III), Dy(III), Pr(III), Sm(III), and Ce(III) may be substituted for Ca(II) in the generation of thrombin from prothrombin or prethrombin 1 by activated factor X. The rates of thrombin generation in the presence of optimal concentrations of Gd(III) were about 25% for prothrombin and prethrombin 1 compared to the rate of thrombin generation with optimal concentrations of Ca(II). Maximal rates of thrombin generation were observed at 20 muM Gd(III) using prothrombin as substrate, compared to 10 muM Gd(III) when prethrombin 1 was employed. Using the steady state rate-dialysis method, the high affinity metal-binding sites of prothrombin and the products formed during prothrombin activation were characterized using 153Gd(III). Prothrombin has two high affinity binding sites for Gd(III) (Kd = 0.75 muM). Prethrombin 1 and prethrombin 2 each bind one Gd(III) tightly (Kd = 1.10 muM and 0.81 muM, respectively). Fragment 1, the phospholipid-binding portion of prothrombin, has two sites which bind Gd(III) tightly (Kd 0.16 muM). Fragment 2 has no high affinity metal-binding sites, but has intermediate affinity metal-binding sites (Kd greater than 1.6 muM). Thrombin has numerous high affinity binding sites (Kd less than 0.1 muM), suggesting that the conversion of prethrombin 2 to thrombin is associated with a significant change in tertiary structure. These results indicate that Gd(III) binds tightly to the metal-binding sites of these proteins and can substitute for Ca(II) in metal-dependent prothrombin activation. In the activation of prothrombin by activated factor X, these data suggest that Ca(II) is required for metal-dependent factor V and phospholipid binding and not as a cofactor in enzyme catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W57892441,"Neuroblastoma adenylate cyclase is activated by 2-chloroadenosine, prostaglandin E1, and 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate [GMP-P(NH)P]. However, the process of activation by the first two compounds is different from that induced by the third. Prostaglandin E1 and 2-chloroadenosine activation is rapid, producing elevated activities which are constant throughout a 20-min assay. In contrast, GMP-P(NH)P activation is slow and although the activity is elevated within 1 min, it continues to increase for up to 12 min before attaining a maximal constant value. Activation is more rapid when either prostaglandin E1 or 2-chloroadenosine is present with GMP-P(NH)P. Activation of the enzyme by GMP-P(NH)P appears to be retarded by endogenous nucleotides as suggested by the following observations: (a) if the enzyme is incubated at 30 degrees with 5 mM MgCl2 for 5 to 7 min, GMP-P(NH)P then produces maximal activation without a detect able lag; (b) if, during this incubation, nucleotides, a nucleotide regenerating system, or EDTA (instead of MgCl2) are present, subsequent GMP-P(NH)P activation is slow; and (c) in the assays which contain a nucleotide regenerating systm and MgATP as substrate, the Km for GMP-P(NH)P is 6 +/- 2 muM. However, in the assays using MgAMP-P(NH)P as substrate but no nucleotide regenerating system, the Km is 0.5 +/- 0.2 muM. GPD and GTP do not replace GMP-P(NH)P as an enzyme activator in any of our assays systems, and in fact, are potent inhibitors of GMP-P(NH)P enzyme activation. Prostaglandin E1 and 2-chloradensine do not alter significantly the Km for GMP-P(NH)P but do decrease the ensyme's sensitivity of GDP. Proposed is a hysteretic model of neuroblastoma adenylate cyclase, which shows the enzyme responding slowly to rapid changes in GMP-P(NH)P concentration due to the slow displacement of the tightly bound endogenous guanine nucleotides by GMP-P(NH)P. Additionally, prostaglandin E1 and 2-chloroadenosine increase the rate of GMP-P(NH)P activation by decreasing the enzyme's affinity for these endogenous guanine nucleotides."
https://openalex.org/W1548438829,"Total cellular RNA preparations were isolated from chicken oviducts at three different development stages: (a) immature chicks which were chronically stimulated with estrogen; (b) estrogen-stimulated chicks which were then withdrawn from hormone for 12 days; and (c) laying hens. Total cellular RNA containing 3'-poly(A) sequences (poly(A)-RNA) were than isolated from these preparations using oligo(dT)-cellulose chromatography. The number average nucleotide length of the poly(A)-RNA preparations in each case was approximately 2000 nucleotides. The number average nucleotide length of the poly(A) residues at the 3'-terminal end of each RNA preparation was approximately 70 adenylate residues. Complementary DNA (cDNA) copies to each preparation of poly(A)-RNA were synthesized using avian myeloblastosis virus RNA-directed DNA polymerase. The cDNApoly(A) preparations were then utilized in DNA excess hybridization experiments to analyze the complexity of the DNA sequences from which these RNAs were transcribed. Approximately 22% of each of the total cellular poly(A)-RNAs were transcribed from repeated DNA sequences (average repeat frequency of 35 copies/genome) while the remaining majority were transcribed from single copy or unique sequence DNA. It was possible to estimate the number of different poly(A)-RNA sequences per cell by analyzing the kinetics of hybridization of these cDNApoly(A) preparations to total cellular poly(A)-RNA extracts under conditions of RNA excess. The results revealed that 41% of the poly(A)-RNA from laying hen oviduct consisted of, on the average, three different sequences/cell, each of which was present in approximately 25,000 copies/cell. The remainder of the poly(A)-RNA in this tissue consisted of approximately 25,000 different sequences/cell, which were present largely in only two or three copies/cell. A somewhat similar sequence complexity was found for oviduct cells prepared from estrogen-stimulated chicks. We estimated that there were approximately 20,000 different poly(A)-RNA sequences/cell, each represented in only one to two copies/cell. However, there were five sequences which were present, on the average, in a concentration of 5600 copies/cell. The poly(A)-RNAs from hormone-wtihdrawn tissue, on the other hand, had a lower sequence complexity. There were only approximately 10,000 different poly(A)-RNA sequences/cell, each present in about three copies/cell. Furthermore, the few sequences present in a great abundance in hen and hormone-stimulated tissues were apparently absent in oviduct tissue from hormone-wtihdrawn chicks, suggesting that the intracellular concentrations of these high frequency RNA sequences are dependent on estrogen."

https://openalex.org/W1217421906,"Cytochrome P-450 from rabbit pulmonary microsomes was purified approximately 32-fold. The purification method involved solubilization of microsomes using sodium cholate, and recovery of cytochrome P-450 in the precipitate formed between 25 to 42% saturation of the digested microsomes with ammonium sulfate in the absence of glycerol. Further purification was achieved by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and hydroxylapatite using Emulgen 913 as an eluent. Partially purified preparations containing up to 7.4 nmol of cytochrome P-450 per mg of protein were essentially free of NADPH-cytochrome c reductase activity and cytochromes b5 and P-420. However, epoxide hydrase was found to co-purify with cytochrome P-450. The CO-difference spectrum of dithionite-reduced purified cytochrome showed the expected peak at 450 nm. However, the magnitude of the peak was dependent on added microsomal lipid fraction in the assay medium. Purified pulmonary cytochrome P-450 formed typical types I and II substrate difference spectra with benzphetamine and pyridine, respectively. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis of partially purified cytochrome P-450 gave two major bands when stained with Coomassie blue. The faster moving band which contained peroxidase activity had an estimated molecular weight of 49,000 +/- 1,200. The cytochrome P-450 fraction, when combined with solubilized pulmonary microsomal NADPH-cytochrome c reductase and lipid fractions, was active in the O-deethylation of 7-ethoxycoumarin and the N-demethylation of benzphetamine."

This is the first crystallization of an enzyme from human placenta as well as the first crystallization of any steroid-converting enzyme of human source. A solution of the enzyme (specific activity 7.1 units/mg) in 1.5 ml of Tris-barbituric acid buffer, pH 7.0, containing 20% glycerol as stabilizer, was placed in an electrophoresis tube and the tube was closed at both ends with a dialysis membrane which permits the passage of substances of molecular weight less than 18,000. The tube was placed in a gel electrophoresis apparatus and the reservoirs filled with the Tris-barbituric acid buffer. A potential of 100 V was applied for 12 hours, then raised to 200 V for another 12 hours, and finally to 300 V until opalescence appeared at the bottom of the tube. Activity measurements showed that more than 90% of the enzyme had concentrated in the bottom 0.15-ml portion of the solution. When this section of the solution was removed and kept overnight at 4 degrees, gross and microscopic examination revealed a heavy crop of crystals which possessed a specific activity of 7.2 units/mg. The specific activity remained constant throughout three recrystallizations. The crystalline enzyme displayed a single band by analytical and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel analysis. Crystals of enzyme of high specific activity could also be obtained from an enzyme sample initially possessing a specific activity of only 4.5 units/mg.

https://openalex.org/W1580591685,"Hypophysectomy of adult rats results in approximately a 50% decrease in the rate of albumin synthesis relative to total liver protein synthesis. This decrease is accompanied by a proportional decline in the number of albumin-synthesizing polysomes, as determined by the binding of 125I-Labeled anti-albumin antibody, and indirect immunoprecipitation of [3H]leucine-labeled albumin-synthesizing polysomes. Furthermore, this decrease is associated with an equivalent reduction in the amount of total membrane-bound polysomes, whereas total free polysomes show little quantitative change. The size of the specific albumin-synthesizing polysomes, as well as the size of the total polysomes, however, appear to be the same following hypophysectomy as in the normal untreated animal. These observations are consistent with the finding that the relative amount of albumin mRNA activity also decreases approximately 50%, as assayed in a heterologous cell-free protein-synthesizing system using exogenous liver RNA prepared from either isolated polysomes or total liver homogenates. The decrease in albumin production in the hypophysectomized rat, therefore, is apparently the result of a reduction in the amount of active albumin mRNA. The concomitant decrease in albumin-synthesizing polysomes appears to reflect a similar reduction in the amount of total membrane bound polysomes. Thus, a major physiological defect in hypophysectomy may be a preferential decline in membrane-bount polysomes accompanied by a reduction in mRNA levels, which is represented by the decrease in albumin synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1504888597,"DNA-dependent RNA polymerase III was purified from the posterior silk gland of the moth Bombyx mori by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, DEAE-Sephadex, CM-Sephadex, and phosphocellulose and by sedimentation in sucrose density gradients. The specific activity of this chromatographically homogeneous enzyme was comparable to that reported for other purified eukaryotic RNA polymerases. Sucrose gradient sedimentation analysis suggested a molecular weight of approximately 590,000 to 660,000 for B. mori RNA polymerase III. Analysis of subunit composition by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions showed that the chromatographically purified RNA polymerase III contained subunits with molecular weights of 155,000 (IIIa), 136,000 (IIIb), 67,000 (IIIc), 62,000 (IIId), 49,000 (IIIe), 39,000 (IIIf), 36,000 (IIIg), 31,000 (IIIh), 28,000 (IIIi), and 18,000 (IIIj). Molar ratios were close to unity for all subunits except for IIIj, which was present in an approximate molar ratio of 2. As has been observed for mammalian class III enzymes, the B. mri RNA polymerase III can be resolved into two components upon electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions. Comparative studies of the class III enzymes from B. mori and from higher eukaryotic cells show that many of the general chromatographic and catalytic properties, as well as the overall subunit compositions, are similar for the various enzymes. However, unlike the mammalian class III enzymes, B. mori RNA polymerase III is completely resistant to high concentrations of alpha-amanitin, and it does not contain an 89,000-dalton subunit. The data are discussed in terms of the function and regulation of RNA polymerase III in lower and higher eukaryotes."

Early fetal brain (gestational age 30 to 32 days) contained the highest activity of NAD-dependent prostaglandin 15-hydroxy dehydrogenase which varied inversely with age of the fetus, dropping to almost undetectable levels by neonatal Day 4. Both prostaglandins E2 and F2alpha, were formed by brain from all ages tested and the total prostaglandins formed rose gradually with age. Thus, the of maximal prostaglandin catabolism which we term the critical prostaglandin period appears in the fetal lamb brain around 30 days gestational age or earlier. These findins together with others previously reported by us in other tissues, support the concept that prostaglandin catabolism might play an important role in protecting the developing organ from possible adverse effects of locally formed or circulating prostaglandins. These adverse effects on the developing brain might relate to the known vasoconstrictor properties of the prostaglandins, as well as to their known effects on the induction of cell differentiation."

It was isolated from two different spiroplasmas (Spiroplasma citri and the suckling mouse cataract agent) by infecting lawns and broth culture of another strain of Spiroplasmavirus citri. Virions from either donor strain had a buoyant density of 1.26 grams per cubic centimeter (metrizamide) or 1.45 grams per cubic centimeter (cesium chloride), and contained five proteins and linear double-stranded DNA with a molecular weight of 14 X 10(6). Other spiroplasmaviruses have not been propagated, and the molecular weights of double-stranded DNA from other mycoplasma (Acholeplasma) viruses are unknown."
https://openalex.org/W2056058202,"A unipositional lead system has been developed to record the human magnetic heart vector and to permit comparison with the electric heart vector recorded with a conventional Frank lead system. Recordings made in five normal subjects showed a remarkably consistent relation between the electric and magnetic heart vectors. However, the angle between electric heart vector R and T waves was markedly different from the magnetic heart vector R-T angle. In addition, recordings made in two patients with bundle branch block showed a different relation between the electric and magnetic heart vectors compared to normal subjects. These data support the hypothesis that magnetic measurements have a different sensitivity to some components of cardiac activation compared with body surface potential measurements."

https://openalex.org/W1588228598,"The relative rates of synthesis and degradation for rat liver 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase have been determined in animals maintained at several dietary states. Relative rates of synthesis were determined by pulse-labeling the enzyme either in live rats and determining the radioactivity in the purified enzyme or in whole cell suspensions of hepatocytes followed by precipitation of the enzyme with a specific antiserum. The relative rate of synthesis of the enzyme in rats fed a high carbohydrate fat-free diet was approximately 3.7 to 5.6 times greater than that in animals fed a pellet diet or in fasted rats, respectively. In contrast, a half-life of 13 to 19 hours was determined for the degradation of the enzyme in all three nutritional states. We have concluded that nutritional alterations in the levels of this enzyme in rat liver are caused by alterations in the rate of enzyme synthesis. Glucagon has no effect on the rate of synthesis of this enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1516180720,"Sheep erythrocyte membranes have been shown in this laboratory to undergo spontaneous vesiculation when incubated at 4 degrees, fractionating into two bands in dextran gradients (R. McGuire and R. Barber, submitted for publication). While vesicles were observed to be formed in several solvent systems, incubation in the presence of complexors to remove divalent cations was found to be the most efficient method for both vesicle formation and their detachment from the residual membrane. We report here on the characterization of these vesicles formed by spontaneous vesiculation. In the presence of a hypotnoic buffer containing 1 mM EDTA, vesicle production proceeds linearly up to 50 hours and declines, reaching its maximum at 72 hours with up to 20% of the total membrane protein found in the upper band. This upper band is shown in electron micrographs to be composed chiefly of closed vesicles, while the particles in the lower band appear morphologically similar to the original ghosts. Total phospholipid phosphorus and cholesterol in the vesicles are enriched to the same extent, giving a lipid to protein ratio of 2 times that found for whole ghosts. The vesicles contain the same individual phospholipids as the ghosts. The protein composition of these vesicles is unique, in that they are almost depleted in the known extrinsic membrane proteins, while containing practically all types of the various glycoproteins of the original membrane. The two main intrinsic membrane proteins (with apparent molecular weights of 160,000 and 100,000) are found almost exclusively in the vesicles, virtually depleted in the residual ghost-like particles. The protein with 160,000 molecular weight is shown here to be a glycoprotein, giving an anomalous molecular weight on sodium dodecyl sulfate gels and having a molecular weight of approximately 50,000 after lipid extraction. This same glycoprotein appears to fractionate with acetylcholinesterase. From the accessibilities of the substrates to the membrane acetylcholinesterase and NADH-diaphorase, it is concluded that the vesicles are right-side-out and sealed to small molecules. There are more membrane sialic acid residues accessible to neuraminidase in the vesicles (in terms of number of residues/mg og membrane protein) than in ghosts, further supporting the conclustion that these vesicles have a normal orientation and are enriched in glycoproteins. The specific activity of acetylcholinesterase in the vesicles is increased 5- to 6-fold over that found in the original ghosts and almost 20-fold over that in the residual ghost-like particles. Consequently, spontaneous vesiculation occurs simultaneously with the enrichement of specific membrane proteins in certain regions of the lipid bilayer. It is postulated that these domains in the membrane, containing clusters of specific intrinsic membrane proteins, bud out and subsequently release glycoprotein-enriched lipid vesicles."
https://openalex.org/W1564646578,"25- and 26-Hydroxylation of 5beta-cholestane-3alpha, 7alpha, 12alpha-triol was studied with reconstituted systems from rat liver microsomes consisting of partially purified cytochrome P -450, NADPH-cytochrome P -450 reductase, a phospholipid, and an NADPH -generating system. Cytochrome P -450 was prepared either by sodium cholate treatment and ammonium sulfate fractionation or by subtilisin and sodium deoxycholate treatment followed by DEAE-cellulose chromatography. No side chain hydroxylation was observed when cytochrome P-450 was omitted. With ammonium sulfate-fractionated cytochrome P-450 25- and 26-hydroxylation was stimulated 5- to 8-fold by addition of NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase. With subtilisin-treated cytochrome P-450 an almost absolute requirement for NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase was observed. Omission of lipid did not reduce the rate of hydroxylation. Centrifugation of the cytochrome P-450 preparation at 100,000 X g for 1 hour just before incubation increased markedly lipid dependency. A significant difference between 25- and 26-hydroxylation was observed with respect to substrate saturation. The stimulatory effect of phenobarbital treatment on 25-hydroxylation and the inhibitory effect of this treatment on 26-hydroxylation were associated with the cytochrome P-450 fraction. The use of increasing amounts of sodium cholate in the solubilization of cytochrome P -450 resulted in a gradual decrease of 25-hydroxylase activity and a gradual increase of 26-hydroxylase activity. 25- and 26-Hydroxylase activities were separated partially by chromatography of subtilisintreated cytochrome P-450 fraction on DEAE-cellulose. The question whether different species of cytochrome P-450 are involved in 25- and 26-hydroxylation is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2001568791,"The spectral properties of Bowman-Birk soybean trypsin inhibitor (BBI) were investigated by analyzing difference absorption spectra and difference CD spectra and by comparing them with those of tyrosyl model compounds. The O-acetylation of tyrosyl side chains showed that the ultraviolet CD bands of BBI above 225 nm originate from disulfide side chains and tyrosyl phenolic groups; phenylalanyl residues do not give rise to detectable CD in BBI in this wavelength region. The results of the tyrosyl ionization experiment were consistent with this interpretation. A broad negative CD band centered around 280 nm in BBI arises mainly from disulfide bonds (epsilonL - epsilonR = -0.83 M-1 cm-1 per disulfide). Each of 2 tyrosyl residues gives rise to negative CD in this region; together they contribute approximately 10% of the total CD intensity at 277 nm (epsilonL - epsilonR = -0.36 M-1 cm-1 per tyrosyl). Disulfide bonds in BBI also have a broad positive CD band centered around 240 nm (epsilonL- epsilonR = 0.9 M-1 per disulfide(. Tyrosyl side chains give rise to a sharp positive peak at 231 nm, overlapping with the positive disulfide CD. Dimerization of monomeric BBI did not alter the CD profile. One of two tyrosyl phenolic groups is relatively exposed and can be 0-acetylated by 100- to 1500-fold molar excess of N-acetylmidazole. The other is inaccessible to the reagent even in the presence of 8 M urea, but can be acetylated in the presence of 6 M guanidine hydrochloride. Fully acetylated BBI has the near-ultraviolet disulfide CD and the far-ultraviolet polypetide CD very similar to those of the native inhibitor, indicating the O-acetylation of two tryosyl side chains did not induce much conformational change in BBI. The near-ultraviolet CD of BBI was altered in the presence of 8 M urea of 6 M guanidine hydrochloride, with a greater change brought about by the latter. Dithiothreitol (20 mM) completely abolished the tyrosyl and disulfide CD in this region."
https://openalex.org/W1581285441,"5-[7ALPHA-3H] Pregnen-3beta-ol, a C-20-deoxy analog of pregnenolone, was synthesized and tested as a substrate for the enzyme system occurring in testes that cleaves the side chain of C21 steroids between C-17 and C-20. This C-20-deoxy C21 steroid was incubated with a microsomal preparation obtained from rat testis and was converted into testosterone in 5% yield. Another C-20-deoxy analog of pregnenolone, 5,20-pregnadien-3beta-ol, was not converted into testosterone by this enzyme system. The significance of this finding for the natural processes by which pregnenolone is converted by the same subcellular fraction into the male sex hormone is examined in the light of the hypothesis that intermediates involved in steroidogenesis are transient, reactive complexes of the appropriate reactants (steroids, oxygen, etc.) with specific enzymes."

Nevertheless, one of the thiol groups resides in a heptapeptide sequence homologous to a heptapeptide sequence containing a thiol group in the E. coli enzyme. Each subunit of the enzyme has 6 half-cystine residues, and four thiol groups are readily titrated with 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid). Titration of these four thiol groups inactivates the enzyme, and the inactivation is partially reversible by reduction with dithiothreitol. One thiol group reacts rapidly unless L-tryptophan, ATP, and Mg2+ are present together."
