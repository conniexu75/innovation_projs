https://openalex.org/W2031654810,"Moiré superlattices arising in bilayer graphene coupled to hexagonal boron nitride provide a periodic potential modulation on a length scale ideally suited to studying the fractal features of the Hofstadter energy spectrum in large magnetic fields. In 1976 Douglas Hofstadter predicted that electrons in a lattice subjected to electrostatic and magnetic fields would show a characteristic energy spectrum determined by the interplay between two quantizing fields. The expected spectrum would feature a repeating butterfly-shaped motif, known as Hofstadter's butterfly. The experimental realization of the phenomenon has proved difficult because of the problem of producing a sufficiently disorder-free superlattice where the length scales for magnetic and electric field can truly compete with each other. Now that goal has been achieved — twice. Two groups working independently produced superlattices by placing ultraclean graphene (Ponomarenko et al.) or bilayer graphene (Kim et al.) on a hexagonal boron nitride substrate and crystallographically aligning the films at a precise angle to produce moiré pattern superstructures. Electronic transport measurements on the moiré superlattices provide clear evidence for Hofstadter's spectrum. The demonstrated experimental access to a fractal spectrum offers opportunities for the study of complex chaotic effects in a tunable quantum system. Electrons moving through a spatially periodic lattice potential develop a quantized energy spectrum consisting of discrete Bloch bands. In two dimensions, electrons moving through a magnetic field also develop a quantized energy spectrum, consisting of highly degenerate Landau energy levels. When subject to both a magnetic field and a periodic electrostatic potential, two-dimensional systems of electrons exhibit a self-similar recursive energy spectrum1. Known as Hofstadter’s butterfly, this complex spectrum results from an interplay between the characteristic lengths associated with the two quantizing fields1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10, and is one of the first quantum fractals discovered in physics. In the decades since its prediction, experimental attempts to study this effect have been limited by difficulties in reconciling the two length scales. Typical atomic lattices (with periodicities of less than one nanometre) require unfeasibly large magnetic fields to reach the commensurability condition, and in artificially engineered structures (with periodicities greater than about 100 nanometres) the corresponding fields are too small to overcome disorder completely11,12,13,14,15,16,17. Here we demonstrate that moiré superlattices arising in bilayer graphene coupled to hexagonal boron nitride provide a periodic modulation with ideal length scales of the order of ten nanometres, enabling unprecedented experimental access to the fractal spectrum. We confirm that quantum Hall features associated with the fractal gaps are described by two integer topological quantum numbers, and report evidence of their recursive structure. Observation of a Hofstadter spectrum in bilayer graphene means that it is possible to investigate emergent behaviour within a fractal energy landscape in a system with tunable internal degrees of freedom."
https://openalex.org/W2087863452,"Lateral superlattices have attracted major interest as this may allow one to modify spectra of two dimensional electron systems and, ultimately, create materials with tailored electronic properties. Previously, it proved difficult to realize superlattices with sufficiently short periodicity and weak disorder, and most of the observed features could be explained in terms of commensurate cyclotron orbits. Evidence for the formation of superlattice minibands (so called Hofstadter's butterfly) has been limited to the observation of new low-field oscillations and an internal structure within Landau levels. Here we report transport properties of graphene placed on a boron nitride substrate and accurately aligned along its crystallographic directions. The substrate's moire potential leads to profound changes in graphene's electronic spectrum. Second-generation Dirac points appear as pronounced peaks in resistivity accompanied by reversal of the Hall effect. The latter indicates that the sign of the effective mass changes within graphene's conduction and valence bands. Quantizing magnetic fields lead to Zak-type cloning of the third generation of Dirac points that are observed as numerous neutrality points in fields where a unit fraction of the flux quantum pierces the superlattice unit cell. Graphene superlattices open a venue to study the rich physics expected for incommensurable quantum systems and illustrate the possibility to controllably modify electronic spectra of 2D atomic crystals by using their crystallographic alignment within van der Waals heterostuctures."

https://openalex.org/W2073109785,"A large-scale analysis of variation in human protein levels between individuals is performed using mass-spectrometry-based proteomic technology, and a number of protein quantitative trait loci are identified; over 5% of proteins vary by more than 1.5-fold in their expression levels between individuals, and this variation is not always linked to RNA level. Efforts to understand the mechanisms underlying phenotypic variation between individuals have focused mainly on events at the level of RNA and transcription factor binding, and on mapping the genetic loci responsible. Proteins are much closer to phenotypes than RNA but few studies have analysed protein variation on a global level. Here, a large-scale analysis of variation in protein levels between 95 diverse individuals genotyped in the HapMap Project is performed using mass spectrometry-based proteomic technology, and a number of protein quantitative trait loci are identified. Over 5% of proteins vary more than 1.5 fold in their expression levels between individuals, and this variation is not always linked to RNA levels. Gene expression differs among individuals and populations and is thought to be a major determinant of phenotypic variation. Although variation and genetic loci responsible for RNA expression levels have been analysed extensively in human populations1,2,3,4,5, our knowledge is limited regarding the differences in human protein abundance and the genetic basis for this difference. Variation in messenger RNA expression is not a perfect surrogate for protein expression because the latter is influenced by an array of post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms, and, empirically, the correlation between protein and mRNA levels is generally modest6,7. Here we used isobaric tag-based quantitative mass spectrometry to determine relative protein levels of 5,953 genes in lymphoblastoid cell lines from 95 diverse individuals genotyped in the HapMap Project8,9. We found that protein levels are heritable molecular phenotypes that exhibit considerable variation between individuals, populations and sexes. Levels of specific sets of proteins involved in the same biological process covary among individuals, indicating that these processes are tightly regulated at the protein level. We identified cis-pQTLs (protein quantitative trait loci), including variants not detected by previous transcriptome studies. This study demonstrates the feasibility of high-throughput human proteome quantification that, when integrated with DNA variation and transcriptome information, adds a new dimension to the characterization of gene expression regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2071885555,"Elevated LDL-cholesterol (LDLc) levels are a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease and atherosclerosis. LDLc is cleared from circulation by the LDL receptor (LDLR). Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK9) enhances the degradation of the LDLR in endosomes/lysosomes, resulting in increased circulating LDLc. PCSK9 can also mediate the degradation of LDLR lacking its cytosolic tail, suggesting the presence of as yet undefined lysosomal-targeting factor(s). Herein, we confirm this, and also eliminate a role for the transmembrane-domain of the LDLR in mediating its PCSK9-induced internalization and degradation. Recent findings from our laboratory also suggest a role for PCSK9 in enhancing tumor metastasis. We show herein that while the LDLR is insensitive to PCSK9 in murine B16F1 melanoma cells, PCSK9 is able to induce degradation of the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP-1), suggesting distinct targeting mechanisms for these receptors. Furthermore, PCSK9 is still capable of acting upon the LDLR in CHO 13-5-1 cells lacking LRP-1. Conversely, PCSK9 also acts on LRP-1 in the absence of the LDLR in CHO-A7 cells, where re-introduction of the LDLR leads to reduced PCSK9-mediated degradation of LRP-1. Thus, while PCSK9 is capable of inducing degradation of LRP-1, the latter is not an essential factor for LDLR regulation, but the LDLR effectively competes with LRP-1 for PCSK9 activity. Identification of PCSK9 targets should allow a better understanding of the consequences of PCSK9 inhibition for lowering LDLc and tumor metastasis."

https://openalex.org/W2031520937,"Water-deficit stress is a major environmental factor that limits agricultural productivity worldwide. Recent episodes of extreme drought have severely affected cotton production in the Southwestern USA. There is a pressing need to develop cotton varieties with improved tolerance to water-deficit stress for sustainable production in water-limited regions. One approach to engineer drought tolerance is by delaying drought-induced senescence via up-regulation of cytokinin biosynthesis. The isopentenyltransferase gene (IPT) that encodes a rate limiting enzyme in cytokinin biosynthesis, under the control of a water-deficit responsive and maturation specific promoter PSARK was introduced into cotton and the performance of the PSARK::IPT transgenic cotton plants was analyzed in the greenhouse and growth chamber conditions. The data indicate that PSARK::IPT-transgenic cotton plants displayed delayed senescence under water deficit conditions in the greenhouse. These plants produced more root and shoot biomass, dropped fewer flowers, maintained higher chlorophyll content, and higher photosynthetic rates under reduced irrigation conditions in comparison to wild-type and segregated non-transgenic lines. Furthermore, PSARK::IPT-transgenic cotton plants grown in growth chamber condition also displayed greater drought tolerance. These results indicate that water-deficit induced expression of an isopentenyltransferase gene in cotton could significantly improve drought tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W2069181755,"This study presents the crystal structures of three functional forms of diacylglycerol kinase, an integral membrane protein that catalyses a crucial step in oligosaccharide and lipopolysaccharide synthesis and assembly; these X-ray structures are markedly different from the only other structure available for this unique kinase that was solved using solution NMR. The integral membrane enzyme diacylglycerol kinase is involved in the synthesis of periplasmic-membrane-derived oligosaccharide and outer-membrane lipopolysaccharide in Gram-negative bacteria. Containing only 121 amino acid residues, this is the smallest known kinase and it has become a model for the study membrane protein behaviour and enzymology. Martin Caffrey and colleagues report here the X-ray crystal structure of native diacylglycerol kinase and of two thermostable, functional mutants at high resolution. Of interest is the fact that the crystal structures are at variance with the only other published structure of diacylglycerol kinase, that solved using solution NMR. In an accompanying News & Views, Jimin Zheng and Zongchao Jia discuss the factors that may have contributed to the discrepancy between the NMR and crystal structures. Diacylglycerol kinase catalyses the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of diacylglycerol to phosphatidic acid for use in shuttling water-soluble components to membrane-derived oligosaccharide and lipopolysaccharide in the cell envelope of Gram-negative bacteria1. For half a century, this 121-residue kinase has served as a model for investigating membrane protein enzymology1,2,3,4,5,6, folding7,8, assembly9,10,11,12 and stability1,13. Here we present crystal structures for three functional forms of this unique and paradigmatic kinase, one of which is wild type. These reveal a homo-trimeric enzyme with three transmembrane helices and an amino-terminal amphiphilic helix per monomer. Bound lipid substrate and docked ATP identify the putative active site that is of the composite, shared site type. The crystal structures rationalize extensive biochemical and biophysical data on the enzyme. They are, however, at variance with a published solution NMR model14 in that domain swapping, a key feature of the solution form, is not observed in the crystal structures."
https://openalex.org/W2010809133,"Bisphenol A (BPA) is a widespread endocrine-disrupting chemical used as the building block for polycarbonate plastics. Epidemiological evidence has correlated BPA exposure with higher risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes. However, it remains unknown whether there are critical windows of susceptibility to BPA exposure on the development of dysglycemia. This study was an attempt to investigate the critical windows and the long-term consequences of perinatal exposure to BPA on glucose homeostasis. Pregnant mice were given either vehicle or BPA (100 µg/kg/day) at different time of perinatal stage: 1) on days 1–6 of pregnancy (P1–P6, preimplantation exposure); 2) from day 6 of pregnancy until postnatal day (PND) 0 (P6–PND0, fetal exposure); 3) from lactation until weaning (PND0–PND21, neonatal exposure); and 4) from day 6 of gestation until weaning (P6–PND21, fetal and neonatal exposure). At 3, 6 and 8 months of age, offspring in each group were challenged with glucose and insulin tolerance tests. Then islet morphometry and β-cell function were measured. The glucose homeostasis was impaired in P6-PND0 mice from 3 to 6 months of age, and this continued to 8 months in males, but not females. While in PND0-PND21 and P6-PND21 BPA-treated groups, only the 3-month-old male offspring developed glucose intolerance. Moreover, at the age of 3 months, perinatal exposure to BPA resulted in the increase of β-cell mass mainly due to the coordinate changes in cell replication, neogenesis, and apoptosis. The alterations of insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity, rather than β-cell mass, were consistent with the development of glucose intolerance. Our findings suggest that BPA may contribute to metabolic disorders relevant to glucose homeostasis and the effects of BPA were dose, sex, and time-dependent. Fetal development stage may be the critical window of susceptibility to BPA exposure."
https://openalex.org/W2035983191,"An ambitious goal in biology is to understand the behaviour of cells during development by imaging-in vivo and with subcellular resolution-changes of the embryonic structure. Important morphogenetic movements occur throughout embryogenesis, but in particular during gastrulation when a series of dramatic, coordinated cell movements drives the reorganization of a simple ball or sheet of cells into a complex multi-layered organism. In Xenopus laevis, the South African clawed frog and also in zebrafish, cell and tissue movements have been studied in explants, in fixed embryos, in vivo using fluorescence microscopy or microscopic magnetic resonance imaging. None of these methods allows cell behaviours to be observed with micrometre-scale resolution throughout the optically opaque, living embryo over developmental time. Here we use non-invasive in vivo, time-lapse X-ray microtomography, based on single-distance phase contrast and combined with motion analysis, to examine the course of embryonic development. We demonstrate that this powerful four-dimensional imaging technique provides high-resolution views of gastrulation processes in wild-type X. laevis embryos, including vegetal endoderm rotation, archenteron formation, changes in the volumes of cavities within the porous interstitial tissue between archenteron and blastocoel, migration/confrontation of mesendoderm and closure of the blastopore. Differential flow analysis separates collective from relative cell motion to assign propulsion mechanisms. Moreover, digitally determined volume balances confirm that early archenteron inflation occurs through the uptake of external water. A transient ectodermal ridge, formed in association with the confrontation of ventral and head mesendoderm on the blastocoel roof, is identified. When combined with perturbation experiments to investigate molecular and biomechanical underpinnings of morphogenesis, our technique should help to advance our understanding of the fundamentals of development."
https://openalex.org/W2080885354,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common liver cancer and the third-leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Nilotinib is an orally available receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved for chronic myelogenous leukemia. This study investigated the effect of nilotinib on HCC. Nilotinib did not induce cellular apoptosis. Instead, staining with acridine orange and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 revealed that nilotinib induced autophagy in a dose- and time-dependent manner in HCC cell lines, including PLC5, Huh-7, and Hep3B. Moreover, nilotinib up-regulated the phosphryaltion of AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) and protein phosphatase PP2A inactivation were detected after nilotinib treatment. Up-regulating PP2A activity suppressed nilotinib-induced AMPK phosphorylation and autophagy, suggesting that PP2A mediates the effect of nilotinib on AMPK phosphorylation and autophagy. Our data indicate that nilotinib-induced AMPK activation is mediated by PP2A, and AMPK activation and subsequent autophagy might be a major mechanism of action of nilotinib. Growth of PLC5 tumor xenografts in BALB/c nude mice was inhibited by daily oral treatment with nilotinib. Western blot analysis showed both increased phospho-AMPK expression and decreased PP2A activity in vivo. Together, our results reveal that nilotinib induces autophagy, but not apoptosis in HCC, and that the autophagy-inducing activity is associated with PP2A-regulated AMPK phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1982886546,"Recent studies showed that the activation of the retinoid X receptor, which dimerizes with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), leads to an enhanced clearance of Aβ from the brain of transgenic mice model of Alzheimer's disease (AD), because an increased expression of apolipoprotein E and it main transporters. However, the effects observed must involve additional underlying mechanisms that have not been yet explored. Several studies conducted in our laboratory suggest that part of the effects observed for the PPARs agonist might involves mitochondrial function and, particularly, mitochondrial dynamics. In the present study we assessed the effects of oxidative stress challenge on mitochondrial morphology and mitochondrial dynamics-related proteins in hippocampal neurons. Using immunofluorescence, we evaluated the PPARγ co-activator 1α (PGC-1α), dynamin related protein 1 (DRP1), mitochondrial fission protein 1 (FIS1), and mitochondrial length, in order to determine if PPARs agonist pre-treatment is able to protect mitochondrial population from hippocampal neurons through modulation of the mitochondrial fusion-fission events. Our results suggest that both a PPARγ agonist (ciglitazone) and a PPARα agonist (WY 14.643) are able to protect neurons by modulating mitochondrial fusion and fission, leading to a better response of neurons to oxidative stress, suggesting that a PPAR based therapy could acts simultaneously in different cellular components. Additionally, our results suggest that PGC-1α and mitochondrial dynamics should be further studied in future therapy research oriented to ameliorate neurodegenerative disorders, such as AD."

Pfmdr1 86Y and haplotypes at Pfcrt 72-76 have been linked to chloroquine (CQ) as well as amodiaquine (AQ) resistance. mefloquine (MQ) and lumefantrine (LU) sensitivities are linked to Pfmdr1 86Y. Additionally, Pfcrt K76 allele carrying parasites have shown tolerance to LU. We investigated the association between Pfmdr1 86/Pfcrt 72-76 and P. falciparum resistance to CQ, AQ, MQ and LU using field samples collected during 2008–2011 from malaria endemic sites in western Kenya. Genomic DNA from these samples was genotyped to examine SNPs and haplotypes in Pfmdr1 and Pfcrt respectively. Additionally, immediate ex vivo and in vitro drug sensitivity profiles were assessed using the malaria SYBR Green I fluorescence-based assay. We observed a rapid but steady percent increase in wild-type parasites with regard to both Pfmdr1 and Pfcrt between 2008 and 2011 (p<0.0001). Equally, a significant reciprocate decrease in AQ and CQ median IC50 values occurred (p<0.0001) during the same period. Thus, the data in this study point to a significantly rapid change in parasite response to AQ and CQ in the study period. This may be due to releasing of drug pressure on the parasite from reduced use of AQ in the face of increased Artemisinin (ART) Combination Therapy (ACT) administration following the intervention of the Global Fund in 2008. LU has been shown to select for 76K genotypes, thus the observed increase in 76K genotypes coupled with significant cross resistance between LU and MQ, may herald emergence of tolerance against both drugs in future."
https://openalex.org/W1990541244,"The identification of novel metabolites and the characterization of their biological functions are major challenges in biology. X-ray crystallography can reveal unanticipated ligands that persist through purification and crystallization. These adventitious protein-ligand complexes provide insights into new activities, pathways and regulatory mechanisms. We describe a new metabolite, carboxy-S-adenosyl-l-methionine (Cx-SAM), its biosynthetic pathway and its role in transfer RNA modification. The structure of CmoA, a member of the SAM-dependent methyltransferase superfamily, revealed a ligand consistent with Cx-SAM in the catalytic site. Mechanistic analyses showed an unprecedented role for prephenate as the carboxyl donor and the involvement of a unique ylide intermediate as the carboxyl acceptor in the CmoA-mediated conversion of SAM to Cx-SAM. A second member of the SAM-dependent methyltransferase superfamily, CmoB, recognizes Cx-SAM and acts as a carboxymethyltransferase to convert 5-hydroxyuridine into 5-oxyacetyl uridine at the wobble position of multiple tRNAs in Gram-negative bacteria, resulting in expanded codon-recognition properties. CmoA and CmoB represent the first documented synthase and transferase for Cx-SAM. These findings reveal new functional diversity in the SAM-dependent methyltransferase superfamily and expand the metabolic and biological contributions of SAM-based biochemistry. These discoveries highlight the value of structural genomics approaches in identifying ligands within the context of their physiologically relevant macromolecular binding partners, and in revealing their functions."

In this study, we examined the effects of adenosine and its receptors (A1R, A2AR, A2BR, and A3R) on osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation of cells derived from patients with MM and healthy control subjects. Mesenchymal stem cells and bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells were isolated from bone marrow and differentiated into osteoblasts and osteoclasts, respectively. A1R antagonist rolofylline and A2BR agonist BAY60-6583 inhibit osteoclast differentiation of cells from patients with MM in a dose-dependent manner, as shown by TRAP staining (IC50: 10 and ∼10 nM, respectively). BAY60-6583 and dipyridamole, a nucleoside transport inhibitor, stimulate osteoblast differentiation of cells from patients with MM, as measured by ALP activity at d 14 and Alizarin Red staining at d 21 (by 1.57±0.03- and 1.71±0.45-fold, respectively), which can be blocked by A2BR antagonist MRS1754. Consistently, real-time PCR showed a significant increase of mRNA of osteocalcin and osterix at d 14. The effect of adenosine and its receptors is consistent in patients with MM and healthy subjects, suggesting an intrinsic mechanism that is important in both MM bone metabolism and normal physiology. Furthermore, the effect of dipyridamole on osteoblast differentiation is diminished in both A2BR- and CD39-knockout mice. These results indicate that adenosine receptors may be useful targets for the treatment of MM-induced bone disease."

https://openalex.org/W1971426748,"Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are heterogeneous immature myeloid cells that accumulate in response to tumor progression. Compelling data from mouse models and human cancer patients showed that tumor-induced inflammatory mediators induce MDSC differentiation. However, the mechanisms underlying MDSC persistence is largely unknown. Here, we demonstrated that tumor-induced MDSCs exhibit significantly decreased spontaneous apoptosis as compared with myeloid cells with the same phenotypes from tumor-free mice. Consistent with the decreased apoptosis, cell surface Fas receptor decreased significantly in tumor-induced MDSCs. Screening for changes of key apoptosis mediators downstream the Fas receptor revealed that expression levels of IRF8 and Bax are diminished, whereas expression of Bcl-xL is increased in tumor-induced MDSCs. We further determined that IRF8 binds directly to Bax and Bcl-x promoter in primary myeloid cells in vivo, and IRF8-deficient MDSC-like cells also exhibit increased Bcl-xL and decreased Bax expression. Analysis of CD69 and CD25 levels revealed that cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are partially activated in tumor-bearing hosts. Strikingly, FasL but not perforin and granzymes were selectively activated in CTLs in the tumor-bearing host. ABT-737 significantly increased the sensitivity of MDSCs to Fas-mediated apoptosis in vitro. More importantly, ABT-737 therapy increased MDSC spontaneous apoptosis and decreased MDSC accumulation in tumor-bearing mice. Our data thus determined that MDSCs use down-regulation of IRF8 to alter Bax and Bcl-xL expression to deregulate the Fas-mediated apoptosis pathway to evade elimination by host CTLs. Therefore, targeting Bcl-xL is potentially effective in suppression of MDSC persistence in cancer therapy."

The aim of this study was to determine whether Sb alters VEGFR (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor) signaling, a central regulator of angiogenesis.HUVEC were used to examine the effects of Sb on signaling and on capillary tube formation (using the ECMatrix™ system). The effects of Sb on VEGF-mediated angiogenesis were examined in vivo using an adenovirus expressing VEGF-A(164) in the ears of adult nude mice (NuNu). The effects of Sb on blood vessel volume branching and density in DSS-induced colitis was quantified using VESsel GENeration (VESGEN) software.1) Sb treatment attenuated weight-loss (p<0.01) and histological damage (p<0.01) in DSS colitis. VESGEN analysis of angiogenesis showed significantly increased blood vessel density and volume in DSS-treated mice compared to control. Sb treatment significantly reduced the neo-vascularization associated with acute DSS colitis and accelerated mucosal recovery restoration of the lamina propria capillary network to a normal morphology. 2) Sb inhibited VEGF-induced angiogenesis in vivo in the mouse ear model. 3) Sb also significantly inhibited angiogenesis in vitro in the capillary tube assay in a dose-dependent manner (p<0.01). 4) In HUVEC, Sb reduced basal VEGFR-2 phosphorylation, VEGFR-2 phosphorylation in response to VEGF as well as activation of the downstream kinases PLCγ and Erk1/2.Our findings indicate that the probiotic yeast S boulardii can modulate angiogenesis to limit intestinal inflammation and promote mucosal tissue repair by regulating VEGFR signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2014504388,"TRPC4 and TRPC5 proteins share 65% amino acid sequence identity and form Ca(2+)-permeable nonselective cation channels. They are activated by stimulation of receptors coupled to the phosphoinositide signaling cascade. Replacing a conserved glycine residue within the cytosolic S4-S5 linker of both proteins by a serine residue forces the channels into an open conformation. Expression of the TRPC4G503S and TRPC5G504S mutants causes cell death, which could be prevented by buffering the Ca(2+) of the culture medium. Current-voltage relationships of the TRPC4G503S and TRPC5G504S mutant ion channels resemble that of fully activated TRPC4 and TRPC5 wild-type channels, respectively. Modeling the structure of the transmembrane domains and the pore region (S4-S6) of TRPC4 predicts a conserved serine residue within the C-terminal sequence of the predicted S6 helix as a potential interaction site. Introduction of a second mutation (S623A) into TRPC4G503S suppressed the constitutive activation and partially rescued its function. These results indicate that the S4-S5 linker is a critical constituent of TRPC4/C5 channel gating and that disturbance of its sequence allows channel opening independent of any sensor domain."
https://openalex.org/W1994061930,"Understanding the mechanisms responsible for tube formation by endothelial cells (ECs) is of major interest and importance in medicine and tissue engineering. Endothelial cells of the human cell line EA.hy926 behave ambivalently when cultured on a random positioning machine (RPM) simulating microgravity. Some cells form tube-like three-dimensional (3D) aggregates, while other cells (AD) continue to grow adherently. Between the fifth and seventh day of culturing, the two types of cell growth achieve the greatest balance. We harvested ECs that grew either adherently or as 3D aggregates separately after five and seven days of incubation on the RPM, and applied gene array analysis and PCR techniques to investigate their gene expression profiles in comparison to ECs growing adherently under normal static 1 g laboratory conditions for equal periods of time. Using gene arrays, 1,625 differentially expressed genes were identified. A strong overrepresentation of transient expression differences was found in the five-day, RPM-treated samples, where the number of genes being differentially expressed in comparison to 1 g cells was highest as well as the degree of alteration regarding distinct genes. We found 27 genes whose levels of expression were changed at least 4-fold in RPM-treated cells as compared to 1 g controls. These genes code for signal transduction and angiogenic factors, cell adhesion, membrane transport proteins or enzymes involved in serine biosynthesis. Fifteen of them, with IL8 (interleukin 8) and VWF (von Willebrand factor) the most prominently affected, showed linkages to genes of another 20 proteins that are important in cell structure maintenance and angiogenesis and extended their network of interaction. Thus, the study reveals numerous genes, which mutually influence each other during initiation of 3D growth of endothelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2067957250,"Distinguishing between clastogens and aneugens is vital in cancer risk assessment because the default assumption is that clastogens and aneugens have linear and non-linear dose-response curves, respectively. Any observed non-linearity must be supported by mode of action (MOA) analyses where biological mechanisms are linked with dose-response evaluations. For aneugens, the MOA has been well characterised as disruptors of mitotic machinery where chromosome loss via micronuclei (MN) formation is an accepted endpoint used in risk assessment. In this study we performed the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay and immunofluorescence mitotic machinery visualisation in human lymphoblastoid (AHH-1) and Chinese Hamster fibroblast (V79) cell lines after treatment with the aneugen 17-β-oestradiol (E2). Results were compared to previously published data on bisphenol-A (BPA) and Rotenone data. Two concentration-response approaches (the threshold-[Td] and benchmark-dose [BMD] approaches) were applied to derive a point of departure (POD) for in vitro MN induction. BMDs were also derived from the most sensitive carcinogenic endpoint. Ranking comparisons of the PODs from the in vitro MN and the carcinogenicity studies demonstrated a link between these two endpoints for BPA, E2 and Rotenone. This analysis was extended to include 5 additional aneugens, 5 clastogens and 3 mutagens and further concentration and dose-response correlations were observed between PODs from the in vitro MN and carcinogenicity. This approach is promising and may be further extended to other genotoxic carcinogens, where MOA and quantitative information from the in vitro MN studies could be used in a quantitative manner to further inform cancer risk assessment."
https://openalex.org/W2029969565,"NF-κB is a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor that regulates a large number of genes in response to diverse physiological and pathological stimuli. The regulation of the transcriptional activity of NF-κB is often dependent on its interaction with IκBα. Proteins that bind to IκBα are critical regulators of NF-κB activity. DDRGK1 is a member of the DDRGK domain-containing protein family with unknown function. In this study, we showed that the depletion of DDRGK1 inhibits cell proliferation and invasion. Microarray analysis indicated that the expression of NF-κB target genes showed the most significant decrease after depleting of DDRGK1, suggesting that DDRGK1 may play an important role in the NF-κB signaling pathway. We further demonstrated that DDRGK1 interacts with IκBα and regulates its stability, thereby regulates the NF-κB transcriptional activity. Our findings identify DDRGK1 as an important regulator of the NF-κB pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2126783853,"The outcome for patients with advanced metastatic and recurrent prostate cancer is still poor. Therefore, new chemotherapeutics are required, especially for killing cancer stem cells that are thought to be responsible for disease recurrence. In this study, we screened the effect of a novel palladium-based anticancer agent (Pd complex) against six different prostate cancer cell lines, and primary cultures from seven Gleason 6/7 prostate cancer, three Gleason 8/9 prostate cancer and four benign prostate hyperplasia patient samples, as well as cancer stem cells selected from primary cultures. MTT and ATP viability assays were used to assess cell growth and flow cytometry to assess cell cycle status. In addition, immunofluorescence was used to detect γH2AX nuclear foci, indicative of DNA damage, and Western blotting to assess the induction of apoptosis and autophagy. The Pd complex showed a powerful growth-inhibitory effect against both cell lines and primary cultures. More importantly, it successfully reduced the viability of cancer stem cells as first reported in this study. The Pd complex induced DNA damage and differentially induced evidence of cell death, as well as autophagy. In conclusion, this novel agent may be promising for use against the bulk of the tumour cell population as well as the prostate cancer stem cells, which are thought to be responsible for the resistance of metastatic prostate cancer to chemotherapy. This study also indicates that the combined use of the Pd complex with an autophagy modulator may be a more promising approach to treat prostate cancer. In addition, the differential effects observed between cell lines and primary cells emphasise the importance of the model used to test novel drugs including its genetic background, and indeed the necessity of using cells cultured from patient samples."
https://openalex.org/W2161728507,"Chemosensory pathways are a major signal transduction mechanism in bacteria. CheR methyltransferases catalyze the methylation of the cytosolic signaling domain of chemoreceptors and are among the core proteins of chemosensory cascades. These enzymes have primarily been studied Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium, which possess a single CheR involved in chemotaxis. Many other bacteria possess multiple cheR genes. Because the sequences of chemoreceptor signaling domains are highly conserved, it remains to be established with what degree of specificity CheR paralogues exert their activity. We report here a comparative analysis of the three CheR paralogues of Pseudomonas putida. Isothermal titration calorimetry studies show that these paralogues bind the product of the methylation reaction, S-adenosylhomocysteine, with much higher affinity (KD of 0.14-2.2 μM) than the substrate S-adenosylmethionine (KD of 22-43 μM), which indicates product feedback inhibition. Product binding was particularly tight for CheR2. Analytical ultracentrifugation experiments demonstrate that CheR2 is monomeric in the absence and presence of S-adenosylmethionine or S-adenosylhomocysteine. Methylation assays show that CheR2, but not the other paralogues, methylates the McpS and McpT chemotaxis receptors. The mutant in CheR2 was deficient in chemotaxis, whereas mutation of CheR1 and CheR3 had either no or little effect on chemotaxis. In contrast, biofilm formation of the CheR1 mutant was largely impaired but not affected in the other mutants. We conclude that CheR2 forms part of a chemotaxis pathway, and CheR1 forms part of a chemosensory route that controls biofilm formation. Data suggest that CheR methyltransferases act with high specificity on their cognate chemoreceptors."

Interestingly, two distinct regions of SAMHD1, the SAM domain, at the N terminus, and the C terminus, distal to the dNTPase domain, display strong positive selection during primate evolution. However, the detailed molecular mechanisms by which Vpx recruits SAMHD1 to CRL4-DCAF1 are yet to be specified. Here, we show that HIV-2 and SIVmac (isolated from Macaque monkey) Vpx recruit human and several simian SAMHD1 proteins to the CRL4-DCAF1 E3 ubiquitin ligase by interacting with the highly conserved C terminus of SAMHD1. Further, we show that a highly conserved, specific sequence motif at the Vpx N terminus is essential for efficient recruitment of SAMHD1. Real-time binding assays, using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis, suggest that Vpx significantly increases the association rate and decreases the dissociation rate of SAMHD1 binding to the substrate adaptor-receptor complex of the E3 ubiquitin ligase. Surprisingly, Vpx-mediated recruitment of SAMHD1 to the substrate adaptor-receptor complex deactivates its dNTPase catalysis and subsequently disassembles dGTP-dependent tetramers to dimer and monomers. These results suggest that Vpx employs an additional viral countermeasure, prior to and independently of proteasome-dependent down-regulation of SAMHD1.

N-terminally HA-tagged full-length DCAF1 or DCAF1 C-terminal residues 1040–1400 (DCAF1CA) were also cloned into pCDNA3.1 vector. The SIVmac, HIV-2 Rod9, and HIV-2 7312a Vpx (VpxSIVmac, VpxRod9, and Vpx7312a, respectively) were cloned into pCDNA3.1 with either an HA or V5 tag at its N terminus or into pET43 vectors with a C-terminal His6 tag, modified to include a tobacco etch virus protease site at the C terminus of a NusA fusion protein. The cDNAs encoding VpxSIVmac and VpxRod9 residues 1–102 or Vpx7312a residues 1–101 (Vpx(ΔC)SIVmac, Vpx(ΔC)Rod9, and Vpx(ΔC)7312a, respectively) were also cloned into the modified pET43 vectors. The cDNAs for monkey SAMHD1 and VpxRod9 and Vpx7312a were provided by M. Emerman (Fred Hutchison Cancer Center, Seattle, WA). Site-specific mutants of Vpx and SAMHD1 were prepared using QuikChange mutagenesis kits (Agilent). The various SAMHD1 and NusA-Vpx fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli Rosetta 2 (DE3) cultured in Luria-Bertani medium with 0.4 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 18 °C for 16 h. Proteins were first purified using a 5-ml nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (GE Healthcare), and then the aggregates were removed by gel filtration column chromatography (Hi-Load Superdex200 16/60, GE Healthcare) equilibrated with a buffer containing 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, and 0.02% sodium azide. The DDB1-DCAF1CB (DCAF1 residues 1045–1396) complex was expressed and purified from SF21 cells co-infected with recombinant bacuolviruses at a multiplicity of infection of 2 for 40 h, as described previously (20Ahn J.

Human embryonic kidney cell lines (HEK293 from ATCC) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum with antibiotics. Cells were plated on 6-cm plates, 24 h prior to transient transfection, and grown to 90–95% confluence. HEK293 cells were transfected with 7 μg of a mixture of pCNDA3.1 plasmids encoding specific cDNAs, as indicated, using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's protocol. When indicated, the transfected cells were treated with 25 μm MG132 (Boston Biochem) for 6 h, 42 h after transfection. Transfected cells were harvested and treated with 300 μl of lysis buffer containing 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.3% Nonidet P-40, 1% Tween, 5% glycerol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Proteins in the lysate were separated by 4–20% gradient SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membrane, and subsequently identified by immunoblotting. For detection of proteins, anti-HA (Covance), anti-V5 (Sigma), and anti-actin (Sigma) antibodies were used. SAMHD1 proteins (0.5 μm) or their mixtures with dGTP (200 μm) in 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, and 0.02% sodium azide were injected into a 24-ml analytical Superdex200 column (10 × 300 mm, GE Healthcare) at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min, equilibrated with the same buffer lacking the reducing agent. The elution profiles were recorded by monitoring fluorescence, with excitation at 282 nm and emission at 313 nm. SPR experiments were performed using a BIAcore 2000 instrument (GE Healthcare) at 12 °C. CM5 sensor chips were coated with anti-GST antibodies according to the manufacturer's protocol (GST capture kit, GE Healthcare). GST-SAMHD1 variants, at a concentration of 10 nm in running buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% P20, 0.02% sodium azide, 1 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine), were injected into the flow cell at a rate of 5 μl/min until the increase in response units (RU) reached 50–60 RU. The first flow cell was used as an in-line reference with GST as ligand. The analytes, at different concentrations in the running buffer, were injected into the flow cells for 2 min at a flow rate of 30 μl/min, followed by a 3-min dissociation phase. The sensor surface was regenerated by repeated injections of a regeneration buffer containing 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0. For steady-state analysis, the equilibrium response of each injection at 120 s was plotted against the concentration of injected protein, using a non-linear, one-site nonspecific model (GraphPad Prism 5, GraphPad Software) to obtain the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) and binding response maximum (Rmax). Non-equilibrium data, including the rate of association, kon, were globally fit to a predefined one-state model using BIAevaluation software (version 4.1). Typically, E1 (UBA1, 0.2 μm), E2 (UbcH5b, 2.5 μm), and E3 complexes (mixtures of equimolar amounts of DDB1-DCAF1CB-VpxSIVmac, -Vpx7312a, or -VpxRod9 and CUL4A-RBX1 at 0.3 μm) were incubated with 0.6 μm SAMHD1 (SAMHD1-FL or SAMHD1-ΔC) and 2.5 μm ubiquitin, in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 20 units/ml pyrophosphatase, 2 mm DTT, and 5 mm ATP at 37 °C for the indicated times. The extent of ubiquitination was assessed by immunoblotting with anti-T7 antibody (EMD Biosciences) after separation of reaction mixtures on 4–20% gradient SDS-PAGE and transfer to PVDF membrane. Typically, 60 μl of SAMHD1 proteins (1.6 μm) were mixed with an equal volume of dGTP (100 μm) in a buffer containing 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 2 mm MgCl2, and 0.02% sodium azide. After 60 s, the mixtures were diluted with 3.13 mm glutaraldehyde, in the same buffer, and incubated for 3 min before cross-linking reactions (50 μl) were quenched with 290 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8 (20 μl). The resulting reactions were separated by 4–20% SDS-PAGE and visualized with Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Assays of SAMHD1 dGTP-dependent enzymatic activities were carried out in a reaction buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol, an appropriate concentration of dNTP (0–100 μm), and 0.1 μm recombinant SAMHD1. The reactions were stopped by mixing a 50-μl enzymatic reaction with 20 μl of 70 mm EDTA, after a specific time interval. Quenched reactions (50 μl) were injected into a Capcell Pak C18 reversed-phase column (4.6 × 250 mm; Phenomenex), pre-equilibrated with a buffer containing 10 mm ammonium phosphate, pH 7.8, and 4.8% methanol. Deoxyribonucleosides and dNTPs were eluted with a linear gradient (4.8–19.2%) of methanol over 22.5 min at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. The amounts of products were quantified by peak integration of the absorbance trace at UV 260 nm and converted to moles based on the calibration curve of deoxyribonucleosides. 100 μl of protein solution, typically at ∼2 mg/ml, was injected into an analytical Superdex200 column (10 × 300 mm; GE Healthcare) with in-line multiangle light scattering (HELEOS, Wyatt Technology), variable wavelength UV detector (Agilent 1100, Agilent Technologies), and refractive index detector (Optilab rEX, Wyatt Technology) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min in a buffer containing 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 50–150 mm NaCl, and 0.02% sodium azide. The molecular masses of eluted protein species were determined using the ASTRA version 5.3.4 program (Wyatt Technologies). We previously described that SIVmac Vpx facilitates loading of human SAMHD1 onto the substrate adaptor-receptor complex (DDB1-DCAF1) of the CRL4 E3 ubiquitin ligase for proteasome-dependent degradation (20Ahn J.

Specifically, C-terminal SAMHD1 residues Arg-617, Leu-620, and Phe-621, distal to the dNTPase domain, are essential for binding (Fig. 1A). The alignment of other monkey SAMHD1 sequences shows strict conservation of this C-terminal region (supplemental Fig. 1) (27Laguette N. Rahm N. Sobhian B. Chable-Bessia C. Münch J. Snoeck J.

Sequence alignment of Vpx proteins from SIVmac and HIV-2 indicates conservation of four N-terminal residues (Asn-12, Glu-15, Glu-16, and Thr-17 for VpxSIVmac and VpxRod9 and Asn-11, Glu-14, Glu-15, and Thr-16 for Vpx7312a) that were previously shown to be at the SAMDH1 recruitment interface (Fig. 1B) (20Ahn J.

Based on these observations, SIVmac and HIV-2 Vpx proteins probably bind the C-terminal sequences of primate SAMHD1 proteins in a similar manner. To gain mechanistic insight into how Vpx facilitates SAMHD1 binding to DDB1-DCAF1, we developed an SPR-based assay to evaluate the rates of association and dissociation between SAMHD1 and DDB1-DCAF1CB (residues 1045–1396) in complex with Vpx. Specifically, full-length human SAMHD1 was expressed as a GST fusion protein (GST-Hu SAMHD1-FL) and immobilized onto a CM5 chip coated with anti-GST antibody. Then increasing concentrations of DDB1-DCAF1CB-Vpx(ΔC)SIVmac were applied, and sensorgrams were recorded. Surprisingly, DDB1-DCAF1CB-Vpx(ΔC)SIVmac dissociation from human SAMHD1 was negligible for 180 s after the injection was complete (Fig. 2A). Similar observations were made with immobilized rhesus (Fig. 2B) and De Brazza's SAMHD1 (data not shown). In fact, the rate of association (kon) and the dissociation constant (Kd) were essentially the same for all three SAMHD1 proteins, ranging from 18 to 34 × 103 m−1 s−1 and from 213 to 521 nm, respectively (Table 1 and Fig. 2C). Similar SPR experiments showed that SAMHD1 did not bind to the DDB1-DCAF1CB complex in the a"
https://openalex.org/W1994076937,"The establishment of set points for cellular activities is essential in regulating homeostasis. Here, we demonstrate key determinants of the fibrogenic set point of cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) by focusing on the pro-fibrotic activity of ATP, which is released by CFs. We tested the hypothesis that the hydrolysis of extracellular ATP by ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolases (ENTPDs) regulates pro-fibrotic nucleotide signaling. We detected two ENTPD isoforms, ENTPD-1 and -2, in adult rat ventricular CFs. Partial knockdown of ENTPD-1 and -2 with siRNA increased basal extracellular ATP concentration and enhanced the pro-fibrotic effect of ATP stimulation. Sodium polyoxotungstate-1, an ENTPD inhibitor, not only enhanced the pro-fibrotic effects of exogenously added ATP but also increased basal expression of α-smooth muscle actin, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, collagen synthesis, and gel contraction. Furthermore, we found that adenosine, a product of ATP hydrolysis by ENTPD, acts via A2B receptors to counterbalance the pro-fibrotic response to ATP. Removal of extracellular adenosine or inhibition of A2B receptors enhanced pro-fibrotic ATP signaling. Together, these results demonstrate the contribution of basally released ATP in establishing the set point for fibrotic activity in adult rat CFs and identify a key role for the modulation of this activity by hydrolysis of released ATP by ENTPDs. These findings also imply that cellular homeostasis and fibrotic response involve the integration of signaling that is pro-fibrotic by ATP and anti-fibrotic by adenosine and that is regulated by ENTPDs."

https://openalex.org/W2045059096,"Numerous studies indicate the importance of acetylation in p53-mediated stress responses upon DNA damage. We and others previously showed that TIP60 (Tat-interacting protein of 60 kDa)-mediated acetylation of p53 at K120 is crucial for p53-dependent apoptotic responses. Nevertheless, it remains unclear how TIP60-mediated effects on p53 are dynamically regulated in vivo. Here, we report that UHRF1 (ubiquitin-like with PHD and RING finger domains 1) interacts with TIP60 both in vitro and in vivo and induces degradation-independent ubiquitination of TIP60. Moreover, UHRF1 expression markedly suppresses the ability of TIP60 to acetylate p53. In contrast, RNAi-mediated knockdown of UHRF1 increases the endogenous levels of p53 acetylation at K120 and p53-mediated apoptosis is significantly enhanced in UHRF1-depleted cells. To elucidate the mechanisms of this regulation, we found that the interaction between TIP60 and p53 is severely inhibited in the presence of UHRF1, suggesting that UHRF1 modulates TIP60-mediated functions in both K120 acetylation-dependent and -independent manners. Consistent with this notion, UHRF1 knockdown promotes activation of p21 and PUMA but not MDM2. These findings demonstrate that UHRF1 is a critical negative regulator of TIP60 and suggest that UHRF1-mediated effects on p53 may contribute, at least in part, to its role in tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2048800820,"HCl treatment has been, for about 80 years, the primary method for the prevention of entry into embryonic diapauses of Bombyx mori. This is because no method is as effective as the HCl treatment. In this study, we discovered that dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) prevented entry into the diapause of the silkworm, Bombyx mori. The effect of diapause prevention was 78% as a result of treatment with 100% DMSO concentration, and the effect was comparable to that of the HCl treatment. In contrast, in the case of non-diapause eggs, hatchability was decreased by DMSO in a concentration-dependent manner. The effect of DMSO was restricted within 24 hours after oviposition of diapause eggs, and the critical period was slightly shorter than the effective period of the HCl treatment. DMSO analogs, such as dimethyl formamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfide (DMS), did little preventive effect against the diapause. Furthermore, we also investigated the permeation effects of chemical compounds by DMSO. When treated with an inhibitor of protein kinase CK2 (CK2) dissolved in DMSO, the prevention rate of the diapause was less than 40%. This means that the inhibition effect by the CK2 inhibitor was the inhibition of embryonic development after diapause prevention by DMSO. These data suggest that DMSO has the effects of preventing from entering into the diapause and permeation of chemicals into diapause eggs."

Recent genome-wide association studies have identified genes involved in regulation of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels. The precise genetic profile determining heritability of HDL-C however are far from complete and there is substantial room for further characterization of genetic profiles influencing blood lipid levels. Here we report an association study comparing the distribution of 139 SNPs from more than 30 genes between groups that represent extreme ends of HDL-C distribution. We genotyped 704 individuals that were selected from Genome Database of Latvian Population. 10 SNPs from CETP gene showed convincing association with low HDL-C levels (rs1800775, rs3764261, rs173539, rs9939224, rs711752, rs708272, rs7203984, rs7205804, rs11076175 and rs9929488) while 34 SNPs from 10 genes were nominally associated (p<0.05) with HDL-C levels. We have also identified haplotypes from CETP with distinct effects on determination of HDL-C levels. Our conclusion: So far the SNPs in CETP gene are identified as the most common genetic factor influencing HDL-C levels in the representative sample from Latvian population."
https://openalex.org/W1993865931,"Theory suggests that aposematism, specifically the learned avoidance of unprofitable prey via memorable color patterns, should result in selection for pattern uniformity. However, many examples to the contrary are seen in nature. Conversely, honest sexual signals are likely to exhibit greater variation because they reflect underlying variation in mate quality. Here we aim to characterize and quantify the mechanistic causes of color in Tectocoris diophthalmus [corrected] to shed light on the costs of color production, and thus the potential information content of its color signals. We use Tectocoris diophthalmus [corrected] because it is a weakly-defended stinkbug, and presents elements that have classically been studied in the context of aposematism (red coloring), and sexual selection (sexual dichromatism and iridescent coloring). Pigment analysis reveals that variation in orange coloration is due to the amount of erythropterin pigment, stored in intracellular granules. This pigment is common in Heteroptera, and as an endogenously produced excretory byproduct is unlikely to reflect mate quality or variation in unprofitability of the bug. Electron microscopy reveals the iridescent patches are caused by an epicuticular multilayer reflector, and the hue and patch size are directly related to the layer widths and extent of coverage of this layering. Furthermore, we identified melanin as an essential component of the multilayer reflector system; therefore, the quality of the iridescent patches may be affected by aspects of rearing environment and immunocompetence. We posit that T. diophthalmus [corrected] has co-opted the melanic patches of a 'typical' red and black aposematic signal, transforming it into a complex and variable iridescent signal that may enhance its capacity to display individual quality."

Cisplatin (cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (CDDP)) is one of the most potent anticancer agents, displaying significant clinical activity against many types of solid tumors (23Kelland L. The resurgence of platinum-based cancer chemotherapy.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 573-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (3656) Google Scholar). However, intrinsic tumor resistance to CDDP is an obstacle to efficient cancer treatment (24Köberle B. Tomicic M.T. Usanova S. Kaina B.

Multiple mechanisms are involved in CDDP resistance, including changes in drug transport leading to decreased drug accumulation, increased drug detoxification, regulation of DNA repair, and alterations of apoptotic pathways (23Kelland L.

Platinum resistance: the role of DNA repair pathways.Clin.

Mechanisms of resistance to cisplatin and carboplatin.Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 2007; 63: 12-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms of regulation of c-Jun expression by CDDP remain to be elucidated. We demonstrate that expression of c-Jun was differentially regulated in CDDP-sensitive and CDDP-resistant tumor cells. Specifically, c-Jun expression was down-regulated by caspase-9-dependent cleavage of c-Jun and MEKK1-mediated ubiquitylation and degradation of c-Jun in CDDP-sensitive cells, whereas c-Jun expression was up-regulated in a JNK2-dependent manner in CDDP-resistant cells. Inhibition of c-Jun expression sensitized tumor cells to CDDP treatment. MEKK1+/+, MEKK1−/−, caspase-8+/+, caspase-8−/−, caspase-9+/+, caspase-9−/−, caspase-7−/−, caspase-3−/−, JNK1/2+/+, JNK1/2−/−, JNK1−/−, and JNK2−/− mouse fibroblasts; PC14 and A549 lung cancer cells; LN18, U87, U251, and U343 brain tumor cells; and 293T human embryonic kidney cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT). Quiescent cells that were grown in medium containing 0.5% serum for 16 h were treated with 50 μg/ml CDDP. Cells were plated at a density of 4 × 105/60-mm dish for 18 h before transfection. Transfection was performed as described previously (22Xia Y. Wang J. Liu T.J. Yung W.K. Hunter T.

Plated cells (5 × 105) were left untreated or treated with CDDP for 12 h and then collected and processed for annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide staining. The cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and 105 cells (in 100 μl buffer) were stained with 5 μl of annexin V-FITC and 5 μg/ml propidium iodide in annexin-binding buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 140 mm NaCl, and 2.5 mm CaCl2 at ambient temperature.

Cells were fixed and incubated with primary antibodies, Alexa Fluor dye-conjugated secondary antibodies, and Hoechst 33342 according to standard protocols.

The MDR1 promoter-specific primers were 5′-TTAAAATGCCCTGGAAAA-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGAAAAGGCTAGGAGAAA-3′ (reverse). Serum-free medium (3 ml/60-cm dish) was collected and centrifuged at 1200 × g to pellet cell debris. Total proteins in the culture medium were precipitated with TCA (final concentration, 15%). The samples were then centrifuged at 12,000 × g, and the pellets were washed three times with ice-cold 80% acetone. The precipitated proteins were dried and resuspended in sample loading buffer for SDS-PAGE. As described previously (30Yang W. Xia Y. Ji H. Zheng Y. Liang J. Huang W. Gao X. Aldape K. Lu Z.

Seven mice per group were used for each experiment. As described previously (34Kondo K. Yamasaki S. Sugie T. Teratani N. Kan T. Imamura M. Shimada Y.

Cancer. 2006; 118: 230-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), one group of mice was administered intraperitoneal CDDP (2 mg/kg) daily for 4 consecutive days followed by 3 off days per course of treatment. The control group of mice was administered intraperitoneal phosphate-buffered saline daily. After 2 consecutive weeks of treatment, the two groups of mice were killed and dissected, and their tumor sizes and volumes were measured before and after treatment as described previously (30Yang W.

Nuclear PKM2 regulates β-catenin transactivation upon EGFR activation.Nature. 2011; 480: 118-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). The data are presented as the means ± S.D. in seven mice. We treated PC14 and A549 human non-small cell lung cancer cells with CDDP for different time periods. Fig. 1A shows that transient up-regulation of c-Jun phosphorylation and expression followed by their down-regulation occurred in PC14 cells, whereas persistent up-regulation of c-Jun phosphorylation and expression occurred in A549 cells. In addition, we detected a cleaved c-Jun fragment in PC14 cells, but not in A549 cells. We also observed c-Jun cleavage and reduced c-Jun phosphorylation and expression in LN18 and U87 human glioblastoma cells but persistent up-regulation of c-Jun phosphorylation and expression in U251 and U343 glioblastoma cells (Fig. 1B). Intriguingly, tumor cells with up-regulated c-Jun expression were more resistant to apoptosis compared with those with down-regulated c-Jun expression upon CDDP treatment (Fig. 1C), suggesting a role for c-Jun expression in CDDP resistance of tumors. To determine whether activation of caspases is involved in c-Jun cleavage, we pretreated PC14 cells with benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone, a general caspase inhibitor. This treatment blocked c-Jun cleavage (Fig. 1D), indicating that caspase activity is required for CDDP-induced c-Jun cleavage. To identify the caspase that cleaves c-Jun, we performed an in vitro caspase cleavage reaction by mixing purified recombinant c-Jun with purified recombinant caspase-3, -4, -6, -7, -8, and -9. Fig. 1E shows that only caspase-9 cleaved c-Jun. In line with this result, pretreatment of PC14 cells with a caspase-9-specific inhibitor (Fig. 1F) and deficiency of caspase-9, but not caspase-7 or caspase-3 (Fig. 1G), significantly blocked CDDP-induced c-Jun cleavage. These results indicate that caspase-9 cleaves c-Jun in vitro and in vivo. We detected the truncated c-Jun fragment, which was ∼8 kDa less compared with the full-length protein, using immunoblotting with an antibody against the C terminus of c-Jun (Fig. 1A), suggesting that the c-Jun cleavage site is located close to the N terminus. Analyses of the c-Jun sequence revealed that Asp-59 and Asp-65 were potential caspase cleavage residues (35Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A. Roy S. Vaillancourt J.P. Chapman K.T. Nicholson D.W. A combinatorial approach defines specificities of members of the caspase family and granzyme B. Functional relationships established for key mediators of apoptosis.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17907-17911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1849) Google Scholar), which are ∼8 kDa from the N terminus. Expression of V5-tagged WT c-Jun and the c-Jun(D59A) and c-Jun(D65A) mutants, in which aspartic acid was mutated to alanine, showed that the c-Jun(D65A) mutant, but not WT c-Jun or the c-Jun(D59A) mutant, was resistant to cleavage upon CDDP treatment (Fig. 1H). Incubation of caspase-9 with purified recombinant WT c-Jun and the c-Jun(D65A) mutant showed that c-Jun(D65A), but not its WT counterpart, was resistant to cleavage by caspase-9 (Fig. 1I). These results indicate that caspase-9 cleaves c-Jun at Asp-65. To determine whether CDDP treatment induces recruitment of WT c-Jun to the c-jun promoter for c-jun transcription and to determine the effect of cleavage of c-Jun on its ability to bind to its promoter, we performed ChIP analyses by immunoprecipitation of FLAG-tagged WT c-Jun and a truncated c-Jun mutant (amino acids 66–331). As expected, treatment of PC14 cells with CDDP for 4 h induced the binding of WT c-Jun to the c-jun promoter (Fig. 1J), which contributed to temperate up-regulation of c-Jun expression. However, c-Jun(66–331), with a deletion of Ser-63, which is the residue phosphorylated by JNK and important for c-Jun transcription (1Vogt P.K. Jun, the oncoprotein.Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2365-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), failed to bind to the c-jun promoter upon treatment with CDDP. These results suggest that caspase-9-dependent c-Jun cleavage down-regulates the transcriptional activity of c-Jun, reducing its own expression. In response to stress and DNA damage stimulation, such as osmotic stress and ultraviolet radiation, cells can secrete FAS ligand (22Xia Y. Wang J. Liu T.J. Yung W.K. Hunter T.

FAS ligand binds to the FAS (also called APO-1 or CD95) death receptor, leading to trimerization of FAS, activation of caspase-8, and subsequent release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and activation of caspase-9 (45Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Apoptosis control by death and decoy receptors.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar, 46Kruidering M. Evan G.I.

To determine the possible involvement of FAS in CDDP-induced c-Jun cleavage, serum-free media were collected after CDDP treatment of PC14 and A549 cells. Immunoblot analysis with an anti-FAS ligand antibody showed increased secretion of FAS ligand from PC14 cells upon prolonged CDDP treatment (Fig. 2A, middle panel), whereas a lack of detectable actin in these media indicated that they were not contaminated with cell fragments. In contrast, no FAS ligand secretion was detected in A549 cells (Fig. 2A, right panel). Incubation of PC14 cells with a neutralizing FAS-Fc fusion protein that binds to FAS ligand reduced CDDP-induced c-Jun cleavage (Fig. 2B), indicating that secreted FAS ligand contributes to caspase-9-induced c-Jun cleavage. In agreement with these results, deficiency of caspase-8 inhibited CDDP-induced caspase-9 activation, as indicated by generation of a cleaved active fragment of caspase-9, and largely blocked CDDP-induced c-Jun cleavage (Fig. 2C). These results indicate that CDDP-induced FAS ligand secretion plays an instrumental role in caspase-dependent c-Jun cleavage. Treatment with CDDP cleaved a portion of c-Jun (Fig. 1, A and B). To determine whether other post-transcriptional modifications, such as ubiquitylation, are also involved in CDDP-induced down-regulation of c-Jun expression, we pretreated PC14 cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 before CDDP treatment. This partially reduced CDDP-induced down-regulation of FLAG-WT c-Jun expression and significantly inhibited truncated mutant c-Jun(66–331) degradation (Fig. 3A), strongly suggesting that full-length c-Jun expression is down-regulated in both a caspase and proteasome activity-dependent manner, w"
https://openalex.org/W2171781930,"Sympathoadrenergic progenitor cells (SAPs) of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) are important for normal development of the sympathetic PNS and for the genesis of neuroblastoma, the most common and often lethal extracranial solid tumor in childhood. However, it remains difficult to isolate sufficient numbers of SAPs for investigations. We therefore set out to improve generation of SAPs by using two complementary approaches, differentiation from murine embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and isolation from postnatal murine adrenal glands. We provide evidence that selecting for GD2 expression enriches for ESC-derived SAP-like cells and that proliferating SAP-like cells can be isolated from postnatal adrenal glands of mice. These advances may facilitate investigations about the development and malignant transformation of the sympathetic PNS."
https://openalex.org/W2040677440,"We investigated the consequences of mild maternal malnutrition in rat dams, in terms of thymocyte responses and the putative role of leptin. The young progeny of dams submitted to protein deprivation (PD) during lactation showed at 30 days of age lower body and thymus weights, significant alterations in CD4/CD8-defined T cell subsets without modifications in total thymocyte number as well as in proliferative response. Despite, the rats from PD group did not present alterations in leptin circulating levels, the expression of leptin receptor ObRb was enhanced in their thymocytes. This change was accompanied by an increase in leptin signaling response of thymocytes from PD rats, with an increase in JAK2 and STAT3 phosphorylation after leptin stimulation. Thymocytes from PD rats also presented a decreased rate of spontaneous apoptosis when compared to controls. Accordingly, higher expression of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, and lower of pro-apoptotic protein Bax, with no change of pro-apoptotic Bad, and higher pro-caspase 3 content were detected in PD thymocytes. Moreover, thymocytes from PD group exhibited a constitutive higher nuclear content of p65 NF-kB associated to a lower IkB content in the cytoplasm. Finally, although there was no change in ob gene expression in PD thymocytes, a higher mRNA expression for the Ob gene was observed in the thymic microenvironment from PD animals. Taken together, the results show that mild maternal protein deprivation during lactation affects thymic homeostasis, enhancing leptin activity, which in turn protects thymocytes from apoptosis in the young progeny, with possible consequences upon the immune response of these animals in adult life."
https://openalex.org/W2027816228,"Purpose To investigate the in vitro effect of four vital dyes on toxicity and apoptosis in a human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cell line. Methods ARPE-19 cells were exposed to brilliant blue (BriB), methyl blue (MetB), acid violet (AcV) and indocyanine green (ICG). Balanced salt solution was used as control. Five different concentrations of each dye (1, 0.5, 0.25, 0.05 and 0.005 mg/mL) and two exposure times (3 and 30 min) were tested. Cell viability was determined by cell count and MTS assay and cell toxicity by LDH assay. Real-time PCR and Western blotting were used to access the apoptosis process. Results ICG significantly reduced cell viability after 3 minutes of exposure at all concentrations (p<0.01). BriB was safe at concentrations up to 0.25 mg/mL and MetB at concentrations up to 0.5 mg/mL, while AcV was safe up to 0.05 mg/ml, after 3 minutes of exposure. Toxicity was higher, when the cells were treated for 30 minutes. Expression of Bax, cytochrome c and caspase-9 was upregulated at the mRNA and protein level after ICG exposure, while Bcl-2 was downregulated. AcV and MetB were similar to control. However, BriB resulted in upregulation of Bcl-2, an antiapoptotic protein. Conclusions The safest dye used on RPE cells was MetB followed by BriB and AcV. ICG was toxic at all concentrations and exposure times tested. Moreover, ICG was the only dye that induced apoptosis in ARPE-19 cells. BriB significantly increased Bcl-2 protein levels, which might protect against the apoptosis process."
https://openalex.org/W2052541727,"Background Although maternal mortality has become a major focus on global public health agenda, maternal morbidity is a neglected area of research. The purpose of this paper is to present the burden of acute maternal illness during pregnancy. Methods A cross sectional study was carried out in Anuradhapura district, Sri Lanka. Pregnant women residing in the Anuradhapura district with a gestational age more than 24 weeks through 36 weeks were recruited to the study using a two-stage cluster sampling technique. All pregnant women who consented participated in a detailed interview using a structured questionnaire. Self reported episodes of acute illness during pregnancy were the main outcome measures. Secondary outcomes were utilization of medical services and frequency of hospitalizations. Results Nausea and vomiting during pregnancy (NVP) was experienced by 325 (69.7%) of the 466 pregnant women studied. Other common symptoms were backache (152, 32.6%), dizziness (112, 24.0%) and heartburn/regurgitation (107, 23.0%). Of the 421 pregnant women who reported ill health conditions 260 (61.8%) women sought medical treatment for these illnesses. Total number of episodes that needed treatment seeking were 373. Hospitalizations were reported by 83 (17.8%) pregnant women and the total number of hospitalizations was 109. The leading cause of hospitalization was NVP which accounted for 43.1% of total admissions and 49.1% of total days spent in hospitals. Conclusions Minor maternal ill health conditions affecting day-to-day life have a major burden on pregnancy period. Evidence based management guidelines and health promotion strategies are needed to control and prevent these conditions, in order to provide comprehensive, good quality maternal health care."
https://openalex.org/W2006446570,"CD1 proteins mediate the presentation of endogenous and foreign lipids on the cell surface for recognition by T cell receptors. To sample a diverse antigen pool, CD1 proteins are repeatedly internalized and recycled, assisted, in some cases, by lipid transfer proteins such as saposins. The specificity of each CD1 isoform is, therefore, conferred in part by its intracellular pathway but also by distinct structural features of the antigen-binding domain. Crystal structures of CD1-lipid complexes reveal hydrophobic grooves and pockets within these binding domains that appear to be specialized for different lipids. However, the mechanism of lipid loading and release remains to be characterized. Here we gain insights into this mechanism through a meta-analysis of the five human CD1 isoforms, in the lipid-bound and lipid-free states, using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. Strikingly, for isoforms CD1b through CD1e, our simulations show the near-complete collapse of the hydrophobic cavities in the absence of the antigen. This event results from the spontaneous closure of the binding domain entrance, flanked by two α-helices. Accordingly, we show that the anatomy of the binding cavities is restored if these α-helices are repositioned extrinsically, suggesting that helper proteins encountered during recycling facilitate lipid exchange allosterically. By contrast, we show that the binding cavity of CD1a is largely preserved in the unliganded state because of persistent electrostatic interactions that keep the portal α-helices at a constant separation. The robustness of this binding groove is consistent with the observation that lipid exchange in CD1a is not dependent on cellular internalization."
https://openalex.org/W2033601131,"Measurement of the level and composition of maternal mortality depends on the definition used, with inconsistencies leading to inflated rates and invalid comparisons across settings. This study investigates the differences in risk of death for women in their reproductive years during and outside the maternal risk period (pregnancy, delivery, puerperium), focusing on specific causes of infectious, non-communicable and external causes of death after separating out direct obstetrical causes.Data on all deaths of women aged 15-49 years that occurred in the Agincourt sub-district between 1992 and 2010 were obtained from the Agincourt health and socio-demographic surveillance system (HDSS) located in rural South Africa. Causes of death were assessed using a validated verbal autopsy instrument. Analysis included 2170 deaths, of which 137 occurred during the maternal risk period.Overall, women had significantly lower mortality during the maternal risk period than outside it (age-standardized RR = 0.75; 95% CI = 0.63-0.89). This was true in most age groups with the exception of adolescents aged 15-19 years where the risk of death was higher. Mortality from most causes, other than obstetric causes, was lower during the maternal risk period except for malaria, cardiovascular diseases and violence where there were no differences. Lower mortality was significant for HIV/AIDS (RR = 0.29, P<0.0001), cancers (RR = 0.10, P<0.023), and accidents (RR = 0, P<0.0001).In this rural setting typical of much of Southern Africa, pregnancy was largely protective against the risk of death, most likely because of a strong selection effect amongst those women who conceived successfully. The concept of indirect cause of maternal death needs to be re-examined."
https://openalex.org/W2123028403,"Human antibody light chains belonging to subgroup II of germ line genes were amplified by a seminested PCR technique using B-lymphocytes taken from a human adult infected with influenza virus. Each gene of the human light chains was transferred into the Escherichia coli system. The recovered light chain was highly purified using a two-step purification system. Light chain 22F6 showed interesting catalytic features. The light chain cleaved a peptide bond of synthetic peptidyl-4-methyl-coumaryl-7-amide (MCA) substrates, such as QAR-MCA and EAR-MCA, indicating amidase activity. It also hydrolyzed a phosphodiester bond of both DNA and RNA. From the analysis of amino acid sequences and molecular modeling, the 22F6 light chain possesses two kinds of active sites as amidase and nuclease in close distances. The 22F6 catalytic light chain could suppress the infection of influenza virus type A (H1N1) of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells in an in vitro assay. In addition, the catalytic light chain clearly inhibited the infection of the influenza virus of BALB/c mice via nasal administration in an in vivo assay. In the experiment, the titer in the serum of the mice coinfected with the 22F6 light chain and H1N1 virus became considerably lowered compared with that of 22F6-non-coinfected mice.

The ultimate goal of catalytic antibody research is to develop new patient therapies that utilize the advantages offered by human catalytic antibodies. Through 2 decades of study of natural type catalytic antibodies as mentioned above, that goal is coming to fruition, because such antibodies are close to actual utilization. In this study, we prepared some antibody light chain genes taken from human lymphocytes, followed by expression of the genes in Escherichia coli. The human antibody light chain 22F6, of 20 other light chains, showed not only catalytic features but also a substantial effect on suppression of influenza virus infection in both in vitro and in vivo assays. The unique catalytic light chain 22F6 found in this study may open up applicable uses of the catalytic antibodies in the near future. We obtained 100 ml of peripheral blood from a healthy volunteer immunized by previous infections of influenza viruses. Peripheral blood lymphocytes were harvested using a Ficoll-Paque (GE Healthcare) gradient, and five vials of 1.0 × 107 cells/ml were stored in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted from 3.0 × 107 cells using an RNA isolation kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription-PCR using a total RNA template using oligo(dT) as a primer (ThermoScript RT-PCR system; Invitrogen). DNA fragments encoding human light chains were amplified from the cDNA by PCR using four primers separately as a forward primer (5′-cacctagGATATTGTGATGACCCAG-3′) and one reverse primer (5′-ACACTCTCCCCTGTTGAAGCTCTTTGTG-3′) (Table 1) including a direct insert to the TOPO site and a start codon. The PCR occurred under the following incubation conditions: 5 min at 95 °C, 35 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C, 50 s at 54 °C for annealing, and 90 s at 72 °C for extension.TABLE 1Kinetic parameters for catalytic antibodies showing amidase (peptidase) and/or nuclease activityNameFormSubstrateKmkcatReference/SourceRemarksmmin−1HIR (BJP)LChromozyme TRY1.5 × 10−46.2Ref. 34Ohara K.

Fragments of the expected size (660 bp) were extracted using a QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Purified PCR products were directly ligated to pET TOPO vector (Invitrogen), and the vectors were transformed into TOP10 cells continuously using a Champion pET101 directional TOPO expression kit (Invitrogen). After propagation of the vectors in the TOP10 cells, the inserted pET21 (b+) vector was repurified and transformed into BL21 Star (DE3) for expression of light chains belonging to subgroup II. The 22F6 clone was sequenced with the ABI automated DNA sequencer model 3100 (Applied Biosystems), using the universal primer of a T7 promoter. The software GENETIX, version 8 (GENETIX, Tokyo, Japan), was used for sequence analysis and deduction of amino acid sequences. The nucleotide sequence is registered in DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank (accession number: AB723624). Computational analyses of the antibody structures were performed using the deduced VL amino acid sequences on a work station (Octane 2; Silicon Graphics, Crafton, PA) running AbM software (Oxford Molecular, Oxford, UK) used to build models of three-dimensional molecules. The resulting Protein Data Bank data were applied to minimize the total energy by using DS-Modeling (Accelrys Software, San Diego, CA). This software uses the CHARMm algorithm for minimizing the energy of a molecule. pCR-Blunt II TOPO vectors containing DNA fragments encoding human light chains were digested by restriction enzymes NcoI and XhoI (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA). The resulting DNA fragments were inserted between the same restriction sites of expression vector pET20b(+) (Novagen, Madison, WI). To express light chains, the expression vectors were transformed into BL21 (DE3) pLysS (Novagen). The transformant was grown at 37 °C in 1 liter of Luria-Bertani medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin to an A600 nm of 0.6 and then incubated with 0.01 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Wako Pure Chemicals, Osaka, Japan) for 20 h at 18 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (3,500 × g, 4 °C, 10 min) and then resuspended in a solution (0.25 m NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). The cells were lysed by ultrasonication three times for 2 min each in an ice bath, followed by centrifugation (14,000 × g, 4 °C, 20 min). The expressed human light chain was recovered as the supernatant. A soluble fraction from E. coli was directly applied to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column chromatography (Takara, Otsu, Japan) equilibrated with 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, containing 300 mm NaCl. The elution was performed by increasing the concentration of imidazole from 0 to 300 mm. Fractions containing 31-kDa protein (corresponding to a human light chain) in SDS-PAGE analysis were collected, dialyzed against a 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, and then purified by cation exchange chromatography using a column of SP-5PW (Tosoh) with a gradient of NaCl solution (from 0.2 to 0.7 m). By this method, a highly purified light chain (>99%) was confirmed by SDS-PAGE with silver staining. No band except for the light chain was visible to the naked eye; nor could we see any contamination of proteases coming from E. coli. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method using a Lowry method using the DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). We prepared a lysed virus sample to use in the following Western blot analysis. Namely, influenza A virus (A/Hiroshima/37/2001(H1N1)) obtained by egg culture was prepared and treated with detergent (1% Triton X-100). Then the lysed virus solution was submitted to an SDS-PAGE experiment without staining. Next, the proteins were transferred from the gel onto an Immobilon-P PVDF membrane. The PVDF membrane was blocked with TBS containing 0.3% skim milk and 0.05% Tween 20. After being washed with TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS-T), the membrane was incubated with the light chain 22F6 (50.9 μg/ml). After washing with TBS-T, goat anti-human IgG (F(ab′)2 labeled with horseradish peroxidase (1:250 dilution; ImmunoPure antibody, lot number JG1153174, Thermo Scientific) as a second antibody was reacted with the membrane for 1 h at room temperature (44Lee D.C.W. Lau A.S.Y. Avian influenza virus signaling. Implications for the disease severity of H5N1 infection.Signal Transduction. 2007; 7: 64-80Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). After four washings with TBS-T, color development was performed using True Blue POD (horseradish peroxidase) substrate (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories). To avoid contamination in cleavage assays, most glassware, plasticware, and buffer solutions used in this experiment were sterilized by heating (180 °C, 2 h), autoclaving (121 °C, 20 min), or filtration through a 0.20-lm sterilized filter as much as possible. Most of the experiments were performed in a biological safety cabinet to avoid airborne contamination. Cleavage of the amide bond linking AMC to C-terminal amino acid in peptide-AMC substrates (Peptides International, Louisville, KY) was measured at 37 °C in PBS containing 0.05% sodium azide in 96-well plates. Purified light chains (100 μl, 4 μm) were mixed with a synthetic substrate (100 μl, 100 μm). AMC released from the substrate catalyzed by the light chains was detected by measurement of fluorescence emission at 470 nm when excited at 360 nm using a microplate reader (SpectraFluor Plus; Tecan, Maennedorf, Switzerland). The concentration of the released AMC was estimated using the fluorescence emission of 50 μm AMC as a standard value. Prior to the following nuclease activity assay, the degree of the contamination of DNase from E. coli etc. was investigated using an in-gel assay, which was performed in accordance with a previous study (9Parkhomenko T.A. Buneva V.N. Tyshkevich O.B. Generalov I.I. Doronin B.M. Nevinsky G.A. DNA-hydrolyzing activity of IgG antibodies from the sera of patients with tick-borne encephalitis.Biochimie. 2010; 92: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). As shown in supplemental Fig. S1, the results concluded that the degree of the contamination is at most about 10%, even if it is the case. Cleavage of the phosphate bond of plasmid DNA pBR322 was investigated under an incubation time of 0–24 h with the light chain 22F6. In the solution, the final concentrations of 20 μg/ml pBR322 and 50 μg/ml light chain 22F6, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 50 mm NaCl were contained in a 25 mm concentration of a Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) at a reaction temperature of 37 °C. The reaction volume was 20 μl. Genome RNAs from influenza virus and Noda virus were prepared in accordance with past studies (17Adachi K. Ichinose T. Watanabe K. Kitazato K. Kobayashi N.

Kumakura M. Takeuchi K. Kobayashi N. Nagata K. Sorting of influenza A virus RNA genome segments after nuclear export.Virology. 2010; 401: 248-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Briefly, virions were recovered from the banding fraction by ultracentrifugation. It was dissolved in a 1% Triton X-100 solution containing 10 mg/ml lysolecithin, followed by a 36–60% glycerol density gradient using ultracentrifugation. Fractions 4, 5, and 6 were recovered as highly purified RNA of the Noda virus. For the influenza virus, we failed to prepare influenza RNA because it was very unstable. The influenza viruses used were A/Hiroshima/37/2001 (H1N1) and A/Hiroshima/71/2001 (H3N2). These viruses were grown in MDCK 2The abbreviations used are: MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; dpi, days postinoculation; MCA, 4-methyl-coumaryl-7-amide; pAb, polyclonal antibody. cell culturing medium and harvested and stored as infectious culture fluid at −80 °C until further use. MDCK cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Neutralization tests were performed as follows (19Schmidt N.J. Emmons R.W. Diagnostic Procedures for Viral, Rickettsial and Chlamydial Infections. American Public Health Association, Inc., Washington, D. C1989: 51-100Google Scholar). The monoclonal antibody or antibody light chain diluted with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was mixed with an equal volume (75 μl) of influenza virus diluted with DMEM adjusted to give a final control count of about 500 pfu/0.2 ml (2,500 pfu/ml). After incubation for 24 or 48 h at 25 °C, an infectious virus titer of the mixture was calculated by a plaque assay. The antibody- or light chain-virus mixture was serially diluted in 10 steps; 0.2 ml of each mixture was inoculated into the MDCK cell monolayer, which had been seeded on a 6-well tissue culture tray (Falcon 3046; BD Biosciences). After adsorption for 60 min at 34 °C, the inocula in each well were removed and washed with PBS. The MDCK cells were covered with the first overlay DMEM containing 1.0% agarose ME (Iwai Chemical Industries, Tokyo, Japan) and 2 mg/ml acetyl trypsin (Sigma), and the trays were incubated for 2 days in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator at 34 °C. After the incubation, the cells were covered with the second overlay DMEM (0.005% neutral red in the first overlay medium). The plaques were counted on the following day. After acclimatization of mice (BALB/cN Sea mice, 6 weeks old, female; Kyudou Co. Ltd., Kumamoto, Japan) for 1–2 weeks, 25 μl (500 pfu/mouse) of a solution including influenza virus H1N1 (A/Puerto Rico/8/34; PR-8 strain) with or without the catalytic light chain 22F6 was given by nasal administration into the mice. The mice were carefully examined for 3 weeks (21 days). From 0 to 21 days postinoculation (dpi), the body weight of each mouse was measured, and the death or survival of the mouse was also counted. At 7 and 14 dpi, photographs of the mice were taken. Acute toxicity tests were performed by AVSS Co. Ltd. (Nagasaki, Japan). Briefly, BALB/cN Sea female mice (6 weeks old) purchased from Kyudou Co. Ltd. were also employed in this experiment. Human light chains were prepared at concentrations of 1.66 and 9.67 mg/ml in PBS. After acclimatization of the mice for 1–2 weeks, three kinds of administration were done: oral, intraperitoneal, and intravenous. For the oral administration, 0.38–0.41 ml (33.2 mg/kg) was given to each mouse (n = 3 mice for each group) using a sonde with a 1-ml syringe (model number 110515F; Terumo Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). For the intraperitoneal administration, 0.59–0.63 ml (49.8 mg/kg) was inoculated into mice (n = 6) using a needle (26 gauge × ½, Code NN-2613S, catalog no. 111021D; Terumo) with the 1-ml syringe used above. For the intravenous administration, 0.30–0.32 ml (8.3, 24.9, or 145.5 mg/kg) was injected into mice (n = 3) using a needle with a 1-ml syringe (26 gauge, catalogue no. ED-124S; NIPRO, Osaka, Japan). Multiple doses were intravenously administered into the BALB/cN Sea female mice (n = 3) every 7 days using a needle (26 gauge × ½, code NN-2613S, catalog no. 111021D; Terumo) with a syringe (catalog no. 110515F; Terumo Co. Ltd.). In this case, 0.10–0.11 ml (8.3 mg/kg; inoculation volume = 5 ml/kg, 1.66 mg/ml) was injected into the mice. This study was performed with the approval of the ethics committees of O"
https://openalex.org/W1976232351,"Tinnitus is the experience of sounds without an appropriate external auditory source. These auditory sensations are intertwined with emotional and attentional processing. Drawing on theories of mental control, we predicted that suppressing an affectively negative sound mimicking the psychoacoustic features of tinnitus would result in decreased persistence in a mentally challenging task (mental arithmetic) that required participants to ignore the same sound, but that receiving a mindfulness exercise would reduce this effect. Normal hearing participants (N = 119) were instructed to suppress an affectively negative sound under cognitive load or were given no such instructions. Next, participants received either a mindfulness induction or an attention control task. Finally, all participants worked with mental arithmetic while exposed to the same sound. The length of time participants could persist in the second task served as the dependent variable. As hypothesized, results indicated that an auditory suppression rationale reduced time of persistence relative to no such rationale, and that a mindfulness induction counteracted this detrimental effect. The study may offer new insights into the mechanisms involved in the development of tinnitus interference. Implications are also discussed in the broader context of attention control strategies and the effects of emotional sound on task performance. The ironic processes of mental control may have an analog in the experience of sounds."
https://openalex.org/W2169565570,"Construction of synthetic genetic networks requires the assembly of DNA fragments encoding functional biological parts in a defined order. Yet this may become a time-consuming procedure. To address this technical bottleneck, we have created a series of Gateway shuttle vectors and an integration vector, which facilitate the assembly of artificial genes and their expression in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Our method enables the rapid construction of an artificial gene from a promoter and an open reading frame (ORF) cassette by one-step recombination reaction in vitro. Furthermore, the plasmid thus created can readily be introduced into yeast cells to test the assembled gene’s functionality. As flexible regulatory components of a synthetic genetic network, we also created new versions of the tetracycline-regulated transactivators tTA and rtTA by fusing them to the auxin-inducible degron (AID). Using our gene assembly approach, we made yeast expression vectors of these engineered transactivators, AIDtTA and AIDrtTA and then tested their functions in yeast. We showed that these factors can be regulated by doxycycline and degraded rapidly after addition of auxin to the medium. Taken together, the method for combinatorial gene assembly described here is versatile and would be a valuable tool for yeast synthetic biology."
https://openalex.org/W1966930106,"Systemic inflammation response syndrome (SIRS) is a key and mainly detrimental process in the pathophysiology of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. The balance of pro-inflammation and anti-inflammation controls the initiation and development of SIRS. However, the endogenous counterregulatory immune mechanisms that are involved in the development of SIRS are not well understood. CD4+CD25+Foxp3 (forkhead box P3)+ regulatory T lymphocytes (Treg cells) play a key role in the immunological balance of the body. Thus, our aim was to investigate the contribution of these key immunomodulators (Treg cells) to the immune dysfunction that is observed in zymosan-induced SIRS in mice. We first evaluated the level of Treg cells in the lung of mice 6 h, 1 d, 2 d, 3 d, 5 d, and 7 d after the injection of zymosan or normal saline by western blot, real-time PCR and flow cytometry. We found that the number of Treg cells and the levels of the Treg cell-related transcription factor (Foxp3) and cytokines (IL-10) in the zymosan-treated group significantly decreased on day 1 and day 2 and significantly increased on day 5 compared with the NS-treated group. In the next experiment, the mice were injected with 200 μg of anti-CD25 mAb (clone PC61) to deplete the Treg cells and then injected with zymosan 2 days later. The number of Treg cells decreased by more than 50% after the injection of the PC61 mAb. In addition, the expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 also decreased. Moreover, the depletion of the Treg cells profoundly increased the mice'mortality and the degree of lung tissue injury. In conclusion, Treg cells tend to play a protective role in pathogenesis of the zymosan-induced generalized inflammation, and IL-10 signaling is associated with their immunomodulatory effect."
https://openalex.org/W2165024425,"Members of the Nuclear eXport Factor (NXF) family are involved in the export of mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, or hypothesized to play a role in transport of cytoplasmic mRNA. We previously reported on the loss of NXF5 in a male patient with a syndromic form of intellectual disability. To study the functional role of NXF5 we identified the mouse counterpart. Based on synteny, mouse Nxf2 is the ortholog of human NXF5. However, we provide several lines of evidence that mouse Nxf7 is the actual functional equivalent of NXF5. Both Nxf7 and NXF5 are predominantly expressed in the brain, show cytoplasmic localization, and present as granules in neuronal dendrites suggesting a role in cytoplasmic mRNA metabolism in neurons. Nxf7 was primarily detected in the pyramidal cells of the hippocampus and in layer V of the cortex. Similar to human NXF2, mouse Nxf2 is highly expressed in testis and shows a nuclear localization. Interestingly, these findings point to a different evolutionary path for both NXF genes in human and mouse. We thus generated and validated Nxf7 knockout mice, which were fertile and did not present any gross anatomical or morphological abnormalities. Expression profiling in the hippocampus and the cortex did not reveal significant changes between wild-type and Nxf7 knockout mice. However, impaired spatial memory was observed in these KO mice when evaluated in the Morris water maze test. In conclusion, our findings provide strong evidence that mouse Nxf7 is the functional counterpart of human NXF5, which might play a critical role in mRNA metabolism in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2033903068,"Extracellular Tat is suspected to protect HIV-1-infected cells from cellular immunity. Seropositive patients are unable to produce neutralizing antibodies against Tat, and Tat is still secreted under antiviral treatment. In mice, the Tat OYI vaccine candidate generates neutralizing antibodies such as the mAb 7G12. A peptide called MIMOOX was designed from fragments of Tat OYI identified as the possible binding site for mAb 7G12. MIMOOX was chemically synthesized, and its structure was stabilized with a disulfide bridge. Circular dichroism spectra showed that MIMOOX had mainly β turns but no α helix as Tat OYI. MIMOOX was recognized by mAb 7G12 in ELISA only in reduced conditions. Moreover, a competitive recognition assay with mAb 7G12 between MIMOOX and Tat variants showed that MIMOOX mimics a highly conserved surface in Tat variants. Rat immunizations with MIMOOX induce antibodies recognizing Tat variants from the main HIV-1 subtypes and confirm the Tat OYI vaccine approach."

https://openalex.org/W2136596764,"ARCHAEA-ExPRESs is an mRNA modification technology that makes use of components derived from the Archaeon Methanocaldococcus jannaschii, namely the tRNA splicing endonuclease (MJ-EndA) and its natural substrate, the bulge-helix-bulge (BHB) structure (1). These components can perform both cis- and trans-splicing in cellular and animal models and may provide a convenient way to modulate gene expression using components independent of cellular regulatory networks. To use MJ-EndA in stable expression mammalian systems, we developed variants characterized by high efficiency and sustainable in vivo activity. The MJ-EndA variants were created by the introduction of proper localization signals followed by mutagenesis and direct selection in mammalian cells. Of note, enzyme selection used an in vivo selection method based on puromycin resistance conferred to cells by BHB-mediated intron splicing from an out-of-frame puromycin N-acetyl transferase (PAC) gene. This approach yielded several endonuclease variants, the best of which showed 40-fold higher activity compared to the parental enzyme and stable processing of 30% of the target mRNA. Notably, these variants showed complete compatibility with long-term expression in mammalian cells, suggesting that they may be usefully applied in functional genomics and genetically modified animal models."
