https://openalex.org/W2039311197,"Clonidine, an antihypertensive drug, binds to α2-adrenergic and imidazoline receptors. The endogenous ligand for imidazoline receptors may be a clonidine-displacing substance, a small molecule isolated from bovine brain. This clonidine-displacing substance was purified and determined by mass spectroscopy to be agmatine (decarboxylated arginine), heretofore not detected in brain. Agmatine binds to α2-adrenergic and imidazoline receptors and stimulates release of catecholamines from adrenal chromaffin cells. Its biosynthetic enzyme, arginine decarboxylase, is present in brain. Agmatine, locally synthesized, is an endogenous agonist at imidazoline receptors, a noncatecholamine ligand at α2-adrenergic receptors and may act as a neurotransmitter."

https://openalex.org/W1608533627,"Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases are activated in response to a large variety of extracellular signals, including growth factors, hormones, and neurotransmitters, which activate distinct intracellular signaling pathways. Their activation by the cAMP-dependent pathway, however, has not been reported. In rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells, we demonstrate here a stimulation of the MAP kinase isozyme extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (ERK1) following elevation of intracellular cAMP after exposure of the cells to isobutylmethylxanthine, cholera toxin, forskolin, or cAMP-analogues. cAMP acted synergistically with phorbol ester, an activator of protein kinase C, in the stimulation of ERK1. In accordance with this observation, the peptide neurotransmitter pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide 38 (PACAP38), which stimulates cAMP production as well as phosphatidylinositol breakdown in PC12 cells, was an efficient activator of ERK1. In combination with various growth factors, cAMP acted in a more than additive manner on ERK1 activity. Elevation of intracellular cAMP increased in vivo 32P-labeling of ERK1, suggesting that cAMP stimulated ERK1 by activating MAP kinase kinase, an immediate upstream activator of ERK1 in the MAP kinase cascade. Supporting this view, forskolin and a cAMP analogue were found to increase the activity of MAP kinase kinase in PC12 cells, alone as well as in combination with phorbol ester. PACAP38 also stimulated in vivo 32P-labeling of ERK1 and MAP kinase kinase activity. Finally, cAMP or PACAP38 increased by 3-fold nerve growth factor-stimulated neurite formation in PC12 cells, which may be correlated with the potentiating effect of these agents on nerve growth factor-stimulated ERK1 activity."
https://openalex.org/W1499659548,"HES-1 is a mammalian helix-loop-helix factor structurally related to the Drosophila hairy and Enhancer of split proteins. It binds more preferentially to the N box (CACNAG) than to the E box (CANNTG) and acts as a negative regulator. In this study, we have isolated and characterized the mouse HES-1 gene. This gene consists of four exons, and the positions of introns are well conserved when compared with those of the Drosophila hairy gene, except for the third intron. Southern blot and interspecies backcross analyses suggest that the mouse HES-1 gene is a single-copy gene and is located around position 26 on chromosome 16. The transcription initiation site, determined by the S1 nuclease and primer extension experiments, is located 31 nucleotides downstream of a TATA box. In the 5'-regulatory region, there are four N box sequences, and the DNase I foot-printing and gel mobility shift analyses show that HES-1 binds to these sequences. Transient transfection assays using C3H10T1/2 cells suggest that there are several positive regulatory regions in the HES-1 gene. However, cotransfection of the HES-1 expression vector leads to approximately 40-fold repression in promoter activity. Furthermore, when the N box sequences are disrupted, this negative regulation is severely impaired. These results raise the possibility that HES-1 gene expression may be negatively autoregulated through the N box sequences."
https://openalex.org/W1606150020,"Transcription regulation of the human intercellular adhesion molecule-1 gene by the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), and the glucocorticoid dexamethasone was studied using transient transfections in 293 cells with intercellular adhesion molecule-1 promoter-luciferase constructs (together with a glucocorticoid receptor expression vector). TPA and TNF alpha induced promoter activity, which was repressed by dexamethasone. Four TPA-responsive DNA regions were identified, each containing a potential TPA-responsive enhancer sequence: 1) -677/-340 an AP3-like sequence; 2) -290/278 a TPA-response element (TRE); 3) -227/-175 an NF kappa B-like sequence; 4) -105/-38 an AP2-like sequence. TNF alpha enhanced transcription only through region 3. The TRE in region 2 appeared to be functionally coupled to a distal TATA box at -313 and differed from the consensus TRE with respect to binding characteristics for members of the AP1 family. The newly identified NF kappa B enhancer (TGGAAATTCC) is bound by a TNF alpha-induced nuclear protein and appears to be the key element in rapid transcription induction by TNF alpha (and TPA), while transactivation of this element is repressed by the ligand-bound glucocorticoid receptor. We propose a negative cross-talk between the NF kappa B transcription factor and the glucocorticoid receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1623861753,"Taxol possesses an unusual chemical structure, a unique mechanism of action, and demonstrated activity in human malignancies. It is the only antitumor agent that has a binding site on the microtubule polymer. The interaction of Taxol with the microtubule polymer results in the formation of stable bundles of cellular microtubules that are resistant to depolymerization. Although it has become evident that the microtubule, specifically beta-tubulin, is the target for Taxol, no information is available on the binding site for the drug. In this report, we demonstrate that 3'-(p-azidobenzamido)taxol, an analogue with similar biological activities as Taxol, covalently binds to the N-terminal domain of beta-tubulin after irradiation of the microtubule-drug complex. Taxol competes with [3H]3'-(p-azidobenzamido)-taxol binding, suggesting that the photoaffinity analog and Taxol are binding at the same or overlapping sites. Formic acid cleavage of [3H]3'-(p-azidobenzamido)-taxol-photolabeled beta-tubulin and subsequent protein sequence and mass analyses have identified the N-terminal 31 amino acids as the major site for [3H]3'-(p-azidobenzamido)taxol photoincorporation."
https://openalex.org/W1565284520,"P-glycoprotein was purified from multidrug-resistant Chinese hamster ovary CHRB30 cells by a combination of anion exchange and immunoaffinity chromatography. The P-glycoprotein was about 90% pure and had a Vmax for ATP hydrolysis in detergent solution of 321 nmol/min/mg with a Km of 0.94 mM. The ATPase activity was inhibited by low concentrations of vanadate and N-ethylmaleimide, but unaffected by azide or ouabain. When the purified P-glycoprotein was reconstituted into phospholipid bilayer membranes, the ATPase activity became highly stimulated by several chemosensitizers and drugs involved with multidrug resistance. Verapamil, a potent chemosensitizer, increased the Vmax for ATP hydrolysis by 22-fold and the Km for ATP by 5.4-fold. This effect of verapamil on P-glycoprotein has not previously been observed. These results demonstrate that purified P-glycoprotein has an intrinsic ATPase activity with unique properties. This activity appears sufficient to account for the ATP-dependent reduction in intracellular drug accumulation of P-glycoprotein-expressing multidrug-resistant cells."
https://openalex.org/W2049780277,"Drosophila homeotic genes encode transcription factors thought to control segmental identity by regulating expression of largely unknown target genes. The formation of the second midgut constriction requires the Ultrabithorax (Ubx) and abdominal-A (abd-A) homeotic genes and decapentaplegic (dpp), a gene encoding a member of the TGFβ family of proteins. We identified a 674 bp enhancer of dpp controlling its expression in the second constriction domain of the visceral mesoderm (parasegment 7). Normal enhancer function requires positive regulation by Ubx and negative regulation by abd-A. This enhancer contains UBX-and ABD-A-binding sites defined in vitro. By generating complementary alterations of the binding sites and the binding specificity of UBX, we show that Ubx directly regulates dpp expression. These regulatory interactions are relevant to normal development, because a transgene made with this enhancer driving a dpp transcription unit rescues the second midgut constriction and larval lethality phenotypes of dpps mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2154515885,"Presynaptic calcium channels are key regulators of neurotransmitter release. Oocyte expression studies suggest that cysteine string proteins are essential subunits or modulators of these channels. Subcellular fractionation revealed that cysteine string proteins copurify with synaptic vesicles. An average vesicle had eight protein monomers with both the amino and carboxyl termini detected on the cytoplasmic face. Thus, docked synaptic vesicles may regulate presynaptic calcium channels and neurotransmitter release."
https://openalex.org/W2036837330,"We have examined the roles of pap DNA methylation patterns in the regulation of the switch between phase ON and OFF pyelonephritis-associated pili (Pap) expression states in E. coli. Two Dam methyltransferase sites, GATC1028 and GATC1130, were shown previously to be differentially methylated in phase ON versus phase OFF cells. In work presented here, these sites were mutated so that they could not be methylated, and the effects of these mutations on Pap phase variation were examined. Our results show that methylation of GATC1028 blocks formation of the ON state by inhibiting the binding of Lrp and PapI regulatory proteins to this site. Conversely, methylation of GATC1130 is required for the ON state. Evidence indicates that this occurs by the inhibition of binding of Lrp to sites overlapping the pilin promoter. A model describing how the transition between the phase ON and OFF methylation states might occur is presented."

https://openalex.org/W2014048648,"Amphibian mesoderm arises from the marginal zone of the early gastrula and generates various tissues such as notochord, muscle, kidney, and blood. Small changes (twofold) in the amount of microinjected messenger RNA encoding the goosecoid (gsc) homeodomain protein resulted in marked changes in the differentiation of mesoderm in Xenopus laevis. At least three thresholds were observed, which were sufficient to specify four mesodermal cell states. Endogenous gsc messenger RNA was expressed in the marginal zone in a graded fashion that is congruent with a role for this gene in dorso-ventral patterning of mesoderm at the early gastrula stage."
https://openalex.org/W2088139813,"The rate of decrease of neuronal [Ca2+]i after an elevation induced by a glutamate pulse is much slower than that after a comparable [Ca2+]i elevation induced by a K+ depolarization. To investigate whether the [Na+]i increase taking place during the glutamate pulse reduces the rate of Ca2+ extrusion, we monitored simultaneously [Na+]i and [Ca2+]i during a K+ depolarization and a glutamate pulse lasting 1 min. The K+ depolarization evoked only a transient increase of [Na+]i from 4 mM to 13 mM, whereas the glutamate pulse increased [Na+]i to 60 mM, and this increase persisted after glutamate removal. An application of bepridil immediately after glutamate pulse when [Na+]i was greatly elevated, but not 14 min after glutamate removal when a basal [Na+]i was restored, evoked a [Ca2+]i increase accompanied by a decrease of [Na+]i, indicating a reverse mode of operation of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. These data suggest that the glutamate-evoked increase in [Na+]i may play a role in Ca2+ homeostasis destabilization."

https://openalex.org/W1539099740,"Phospholamban inhibits the Ca(2+)-ATPase of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum by lowering its affinity for Ca2+. In earlier studies (Toyofuku, T., Kazimierz, K., Tada, M., and MacLennan, D. H. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 2809-2815), parts of the phosphorylation and nucleotide binding/hinge domains of the Ca(2+)-ATPase were shown to be essential for phospholamban interaction. In order to identify the sites in phospholamban which interact with the Ca(2+)-ATPase, a series of mutants containing amino acid replacements in the cytoplasmic and transmembrane regions of phospholamban were co-expressed with the cardiac/slow-twitch muscle Ca(2+)-ATPase isozyme, SERCA2a, in HEK-293 cells. Mutation of residues in the cytoplasmic 1A domain of phospholamban, including positively charged residues, Lys3, Arg9, Arg13, and Arg14, negatively charged residue, Glu2, hydrophobic residues, Val4, Leu7, Ala11, Ile12, Ala15, and Ile18, and phosphorylation site residues, Ser16 and Thr17, resulted in loss of the inhibitory effect of phospholamban on Ca2+ transport by the Ca(2+)-ATPase. By contrast, mutation of Met1, Gln5, Tyr6, Thr8, Ser10, Glu19, or Met20 or of residues in the cytoplasmic 1B domain (Pro21 to Asn30) and of Cys41 in the transmembrane domain (Leu31 to Leu52) did not diminish the inhibitory effects of phospholamban on Ca2+ transport. These results suggest that a region essential for functional association of phospholamban with the Ca(2+)-ATPase lies in the cytoplasmic 1A domain of phospholamban."
https://openalex.org/W1605053704,"It is now widely appreciated that G-protein-coupled cell-surface receptors can modulate distinct signal transduction pathways via coupling to different GTP-binding proteins. In the present study, we have used a transient co-expression approach to study the coupling of a single alpha 2-adrenergic receptor (alpha 2AAR) population to three different G protein subtypes (Gi, Gq, and Gs) acting on two different cellular effectors in HEK 293 cells. In all cases, the affinity of the receptor for the alpha 2A-adrenergic agonist, UK14304, is unchanged (KD approximately equal to 670 nM). However, there is a dramatic difference in the EC50 of UK14304 in eliciting inhibition of endogenous adenylyl cyclase via endogenous Gi (0.09 nM) versus activation of phospholipase C via co-transfected Gq (50 nM) or stimulation of endogenous adenylyl cyclase via co-transfected Gs (70 nM) in HEK 293 cells. These findings are consistent with the interpretations that the alpha 2AAR preferentially interacts with Gi rather than Gs or Gq. When the alpha 2AAR was mutated at Asp79, a residue highly conserved among G-protein-coupled receptors, the mutant D79N alpha 2AAR lost the ability to couple to Gq and Gs and, although it was able to couple to inhibition of cyclase via pertussis toxin-sensitive pathways (Gi), it did so with a lower potency than observed for the wild-type alpha 2AAR (EC50 = 7.2 nM). The most straightforward interpretation of these data is that the D79N mutation in the alpha 2AAR reduces the efficiency of coupling of the alpha 2AAR to all G-proteins, thus eliminating signal transduction through those pathways less efficiently coupled to the alpha 2AAR. Since the transient expression assays described permit manipulation of the structure of both the receptor or the G-protein, the present strategies could be exploited to delineate the complementary domains specifying the affinity and/or efficacy of receptor coupling to distinct GTP-binding proteins."

https://openalex.org/W2039187859,"Serotonergic neurons are thought to play a role in depression and obsessive compulsive disorder. However, their functional transmitter repertoire is incompletely known. To investigate this repertoire, intracellular recordings were obtained from 132 cytochemically identified rat mesopontine serotonergic neurons that had reestablished synapses in microcultures. Approximately 60% of the neurons evoked excitatory glutamatergic potentials in themselves or in target neurons. Glutamatergic transmission was frequently observed in microcultures containing a solitary serotonergic neuron. Evidence for co-release of serotonin and glutamate from single raphe neurons was also obtained. However, evidence for γ-aminobutyric acid release by serotonergic neurons was observed in only two cases. These findings indicate that many cultured serotonergic neurons form glutamatergic synapses and may explain several observations in slices and in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1528567179,"Hsp47, an endoplasmic reticulum resident protein, has gelatin-binding and procollagen-binding properties and has been hypothesized to function as a molecular chaperone in regulating procollagen folding and/or assembly. In this report, we further investigate the interaction of Hsp47 with polysome-associated alpha 1(I) procollagen chains following antisense treatment of 3T6 cells. For these studies, we employed phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides directed to the first five codons of Hsp47 that straddle the predicted translation initiation site of mouse Hsp47. Cells depleted of Hsp47 in this manner were observed to produce diminished amounts of fully elongated nascent alpha 1(I) procollagen while accumulating shorter procollagen peptides associated with peptidyl-tRNA. Pulse-labeling of cells with [35S]methionine followed by treatment with puromycin and immunoprecipitation with anti-Hsp47 and anti-procollagen antibodies revealed that Hsp47 is associated with alpha 1(I) procollagen at a very early point during translocation of the nascent procollagen chains. Although Hsp47 appears to possess properties similar to grp78/BiP, Hsp47 binding early during translocation favors a more specialized specific function relative to chain selection or completion of stable folding in type I procollagen."
https://openalex.org/W2002156001,"We investigated signaling between individual nerve terminals and perisynaptic Schwann cells, the teloglial cells that cover neuromuscular junctions. When deprived of neuronal activity in vivo, either by motor nerve transection or tetrodotoxin injection, perisynaptic Schwann cells rapidly up-regulated glial fibrillary acidic protein. Addition of transcription or translation inhibitors to excised muscles prevented this increase. Stimulation of cut nerves prevented glial fibrillary acidic protein increases even when postsynaptic nicotinic receptors were blocked, but not when neurotransmitter release was blocked with w-conotoxin GVIA. We conclude that there is a nerve terminal to glial signal, requiring presynaptic neurotransmitter release, which regulates perisynaptic Schwann cell genes. This may be a general principle since many types of glia are sensitive to transmitters applied in vitro or released in situ."
https://openalex.org/W1503457692,"Transcription of the carbamoyl-phosphate synthase (glutamine-hydrolyzing)/aspartate carbamoyltransferase/dihydroorotase (CAD) gene from the Syrian hamster, Mesocricetus auratus, starts at a single major site. We characterized the cis-acting elements that position RNA polymerase II at the correct start site in the CAD promoter. Sequence alignment showed that the CAD promoter lacks a TATA box, but contains a consensus initiator. Mutational analysis of the CAD promoter demonstrated that the sequences between -81 and +26 were sufficient for accurate and efficient transcription in vitro and in vivo; binding sites for the transcription factor Sp1 around -70 and -49 were necessary for transcriptional activity. The binding site at -49 directed initiation about 50 base pairs downstream. A ubiquitous activator protein, Honk, bound to the CAD promoter between -30 and -12, but did not participate in start site selection. The sequences around +1, which contain the consensus initiator, contributed to promoter activity; however, the presence of a consensus initiator in this region was neither necessary nor sufficient for transcription. We concluded from these results that the Sp1 binding site at -49 substituted for the missing TATA box and played a major role in start site selection at the CAD promoter."
https://openalex.org/W1487931125,"We incubated in vitro translated precursor of medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) with isolated rat liver mitochondria and fractionated the solubilized mitochondria on gel filtration. After a 5-min import into mitochondria, MCAD was recovered exclusively as a high molecular weight (hMr) complex (700,000), while after a 10-min import, it was recovered mainly in the hMr complex and mature tetramer, with a small amount in monomer. Either a further 15-min chase or exposure to ATP caused a marked decrease of MCAD in the hMr complex and an increase in the mature tetramer in comparable amounts, suggesting that the hMr complex was the precursor of tetramer. No monomer was detected in either case. Using specific antibodies, we have shown that the hMr complex represented a complex of MCAD and heat-shock protein 60 (hsp60), and, that upon import into mitochondria, unfolded MCAD first formed a transient complex with mitochondrial heat-shock protein 70 (hsp70mit) and then transferred to hsp60 to complete its folding into an assembly-competent conformation. We also examined the assembly of K304E MCAD, which is a prevalent variant enzyme among patients with MCAD deficiency. The assembly of the K304E into its tetrameric form was severely impaired. The binding of K304E with hsp70mit and its transfer from hsp70mit to hsp60 were normal. However, the hsp60 complex of K304E was much more stable than the wild-type counterpart upon a 15-min chase or exposure to ATP, suggesting that the folding in, or the transfer of K304E subunit to tetramer from, the complex with hsp60 was impaired."
https://openalex.org/W1494137510,"Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) increases cAMP production and stimulates hormone release from a variety of anterior pituitary cells. However, in anterior pituitary gonadotrophs PACAP stimulates oscillations in cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) that appear to be independent of cAMP. To study the mechanisms involved in this response, we used the patch-clamp technique to microperfuse various agents into single rat gonadotrophs while monitoring [Ca2+]i with microfluorometry. Extracellular application of PACAP to single gonadotrophs stimulated high amplitude (> 1 microM) oscillations in [Ca2+]i, which were blocked by intracellular application of GDP beta S (guanosine 5'-O-2-thiodiphosphate), indicating the involvement of a G-protein. To identify the intracellular messenger(s) involved, we microperfused gonadotrophs with cAMP, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3), or heparin, an antagonist of the Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor. A high concentration of cAMP (100 microM) had no significant effect on basal [Ca2+]i and did not alter the PACAP-stimulated Ca2+ response. Heparin, but not its inactive isoform, completely blocked the PACAP-stimulated increase in [Ca2+]i, while Ins(1,4,5)P3 stimulated oscillations in [Ca2+]i very similar to those observed in response to PACAP. These results strongly suggest that PACAP mobilizes Ca2+ through an Ins(1,4,5)P3-dependent mechanism. The fact that PACAP stimulates two signaling pathways in pituitary cells could substantially enhance the signaling potential of this hypothalamic peptide."
https://openalex.org/W1512847484,"We investigated the activation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II) via stimulation of glutamate receptors and subsequent phosphorylation of vimentin and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in cultured rat cortical astrocytes. The indirect immunofluorescence analysis with the anti-CaM kinase II antibody revealed that the enzyme was detected diffusely in the cytoplasm and more intensely in the nucleus. Glutamate elevated the Ca(2+)-independent activity of CaM kinase II through autophosphorylation, and this response was blocked by both DL-2-amino-3-phosphonopropionate and 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione, but not by D-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate. In the experiments using 32P-labeled astrocytes, the phosphorylation of vimentin and GFAP as well as autophosphorylation of CaM kinase II were found to be stimulated after the exposure to glutamate. It was concluded by two-dimensional phosphopeptide analysis that the increased phosphorylation of vimentin and GFAP observed in intact cells were due to the activation of CaM kinase II by glutamate. These results suggest that glutamate can activate CaM kinase II through stimulation of both the metabotropic and non-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, and that the concomitant phosphorylation of vimentin and GFAP may in turn regulate the functions of intermediate filament proteins in intact astrocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1567601758,"The expression of the prodynorphin gene was investigated in adult cultured rat ventricular cardiac myocytes by using a sensitive solution hybridization RNase protection assay for the quantitative analysis of prodynorphin mRNA. Myocyte culture in high KCl resulted, after 4 h, in a marked increase in cellular prodynorphin mRNA, while a KCl treatment for 6, 12, or 24 h progressively down-regulated the levels of prodynorphin mRNA below the control value. Immunoreactive dynorphin B, a biologically active end product of the precursor, was found to be present in the culture medium in significantly higher amounts than in the cardiac myocytes. The levels of this biologically active K opioid receptor agonist significantly increased after 4 h of KCl treatment and were markedly reduced following a 24-h exposure of the cardiac myocytes to KCl. These KCl-induced effects were all abolished by cell incubation in the presence of the calcium channel blocker verapamil. In single cardiac myocytes, acute stimulation of K opioid receptors with dynorphin B or with the selective agonist U-50,488H increased the level of cytosolic calcium. This effect was abolished by the specific K opioid receptor antagonist (Mr-1452) and was not affected by the removal of calcium from the bathing medium. These results suggest that an opioid gene may influence the myocardial function in an autocrine or paracrine fashion."
https://openalex.org/W1597838177,"Chaperonin-mediated, in vitro folding of rhodanese by the intact protein cpn60 has previously been shown to require cpn10 and ATP hydrolysis (Martin, J., Langer, T., Boteva, R., Schramel, A., Horwich, A. L., and Hartl, F.-U. (1991) Nature 352, 36-42; Mendoza, J. A., Rogers, E., Lorimer, G. H., and Horowitz, P. M. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 13044-13049). The present work demonstrates that the rhodanese-cpn60 complex can be dissociated by urea to allow folding to proceed, thus removing the obligatory requirement for cpn10 and ATP. Analytical ultracentrifugation and circular dichroism show that tetradecameric cpn60 can be disassembled into monomers that retain substantial secondary structure. Unfolded rhodanese induces the reassembly of tetradecameric cpn60 from monomers, and binding of rhodanese stabilizes cpn60 quaternary structure. Intermediate cpn60 species, possibly heptamers, are detected at intermediate urea concentrations after addition of unfolded rhodanese. The use of urea has demonstrated a functionally related loosening of subunit interactions in cpn60 that is not detectable under usual solution conditions. Our data suggest a highly dynamic role for the quaternary structure of cpn60 in chaperonin-mediated protein folding."
https://openalex.org/W1565624012,"A DNA polymerase with properties similar to mammalian polymerase delta has been isolated to near homogeneity from early embryos of Drosophila melanogaster. A combination of exclusion chromatography and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicates that this enzyme has a total molecular mass of 185 kDa and is composed of 138- and 47-kDa polypeptides. Its isoelectric point is 6.8. This polymerase activity is strongly inhibited by N-ethylmaleimide, aphidicolin, and high KCl concentration but is relatively insensitive to 2',3'-dideoxythymidine 5'-triphosphate. There was no reaction in an immunological test using monoclonal antibody against Drosophila DNA polymerase alpha. In a final purification step, this polymerase activity was accompanied by 3'-->5'-exonuclease activity as expected proof-reading activity. This polymerase activity is remarkably stimulated by mouse proliferating cell nuclear antigen, which is structurally and immunologically very similar to a Drosophila counterpart. These properties clearly indicate this enzyme belongs to the category of DNA polymerase delta."
https://openalex.org/W1507164076,"Binding Ca2+ to a high affinity site in protein C and Gla-domainless protein C (protein C lacking residues 1-44) results in a conformational change that is required for activation by the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex, the natural activator of protein C. Protein C modeling studies suggested the single high affinity Ca2+ binding-site might be present in a loop in the protease domain and involve Glu-70 and -80 (chymotrypsin numbering system). This loop, which is a known Ca(2+)-binding site in trypsin, is also conserved in other coagulation proteases, including factors VII, IX,and X. In thrombin, which does not bind Ca2+, Glu-70 is replaced by Lys, creating an internal salt bridge with Glu-80. We constructed and expressed a Gla-domainless protein C mutant in which Glu-80 is replaced with Lys. The activation of the resultant mutant is accelerated by thrombomodulin in a Ca(2+)-independent fashion. Unlike wild type Gla-domainless protein C, Ca2+ no longer inhibits activation of the mutant by free thrombin, and Ca2+ stimulation of chromogenic activity is also absent. The characteristic Ca(2+)-dependent quenching of Gla-domainless protein C intrinsic fluorescence is also absent in the mutant. We conclude that the high affinity Ca(2+)-binding site in protein C critical for zymogen activation involves Glu-80. The Glu-80 to Lys mutation probably results in a salt bridge with Glu-70 that stabilizes protein C zymogen in a conformation similar, if not identical, to the Ca(2+)-stabilized conformation favorable for rapid activation by the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex."
https://openalex.org/W1579370994,"Expression of the Nef protein encoded by human and simian immunodeficiency viruses results in the specific down-regulation of CD4 from the cell surface in both lymphoid and non-lymphoid cells. In this report, we examine the biosynthesis and cell surface expression of CD4 in the human T cell line, CEM-SS, that has been stably transduced with the SIV nef gene. Quantification of CD4 in Nef-expressing cells reveals that the steady state level of CD4 is significantly reduced as compared to control transductants. The presence of Nef in these cells promotes the degradation of newly synthesized CD4 protein. The biosynthesis and oligosaccharide processing of CD4 in Nef-expressing T cells appears to be normal through the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi compartments, suggesting that the degradation of CD4 is a late event in the biosynthetic pathway. Treatment with the lysosomotropic agents chloroquine and primaquine prevents the degradation of CD4 in Nef-expressing CEM-SS cells, indicating that the degradation of CD4 likely occurs in an acidic compartment. Thus the reduced cell surface expression observed in Nef-expressing CEM-SS cells is the likely consequence of a Nef-induced sorting of CD4 into a cellular compartment where CD4 is then degraded."
https://openalex.org/W1590084917,"Plasminogen (Pg) activation on the surface of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovial fibroblasts by the urinary-type Pg activator induced a significant increase in cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration. This response was not observed in normal synovial fibroblasts, suggesting different Pg binding and activation mechanisms in these cell types. Pg receptors from both cell types were isolated by affinity chromatography using Pg covalently bound to Sepharose 4B. RA synovial fibroblasts express a Pg complex composed of a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa-related protein in association with a 130-kDa protein that is antigenically related to the alpha 2-macroglobulin receptor-associated protein and dipeptidyl peptidase IV. This complex appears to bind to both Pg and fibronectin. The Pg receptor in normal synovial fibroblasts is composed of a 97-kDa protein also antigenically related to the alpha 2-macroglobulin receptor-associated protein. Both cell types express the urinary-type Pg activator on their surfaces. Our results suggest that RA synovial fibroblasts express novel proteins involved in Pg binding, activation, and signal transduction, which are absent in normal synovial fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W1533398380,"Glutamine produced and stored in skeletal muscle is an important source of nitrogen and energy for the whole body in health and disease and, unsurprisingly, glutamine turnover in muscle is subject to substantial metabolic control. l-Glutamate, a necessary substrate for glutamine synthetase, is transported into muscle cells by Na+-dependent and -independent transport systems. In primary cultures of rat skeletal muscle myotubes (a useful model system for studies of muscle metabolism and membrane transport), Na+-dependent glutamate transport (Km ≈ 0.7 mM glutamate) shows adaptive up-regulation (65% increase in transport Vmax from 2.7 to 4.4 nmol · min–1 · mg protein–1) in cells within 24 h of glutamine depletion (t1/2 for increase of ≈ 4 h), whereas Na+-ndependent glutamate uptake remains unaltered. Up-regulation of transport is suppressed by inhibitors of gene transcription (actinomycin-D) and translation (cycloheximide) and is reversed by glutamine supplementation. Increased glutamate transport capacity should provide extra substrate for glutamine synthesis in muscle cells. Thus, in concert with previously discovered increases in cell glutamine transport capacity and glutamine synthetase activity, it may represent part of a coordinated response to decreased glutamine availability (e.g., under circumstances of increased glutamine utilization by other tissues in vivo).— Low, S. Y., Rennie, M. J., Taylor, P. M. Sodium-dependent glutamate transport in cultured rat myotubes increases after glutamine deprivation. FASEB J. 8: 127-131; 1994."
https://openalex.org/W1492413317,"We have studied the glycolipid composition of human cataractous lenses. Neutral and acidic lipid fractions were isolated by column chromatographies on DEAE-Sephadex and Iatrobeads. The neutral glycolipid fraction and acidic glycolipid fraction contained 0.6-0.9 micrograms of lipid-bound glucose (Glc) per mg of protein and 0.8-1.3 micrograms of lipid-bound sialic acid (NeuAc) per mg of protein, respectively. The neutral glycolipid fraction was found to contain LacCer (39.0% of total neutral glycolipids), Gb3 (16.2%), Gb4 (1.1%), nLc4 (5.0%), X (29.0%), and Y (9.2%). The acidic lipid fraction was found to contain mainly GM3 (33.1% of the total ganglioside fraction), GM1 (8.3%), LM1 (7.3%), GD1a (16.0%), and G (30.1%). The structures of neutral glycolipids X and Y and ganglioside G were elucidated by high performance thin-layer chromatography overlay method of glycolipids, gas-liquid chromatography, proton NMR spectrometry, and liquid secondary ion mass spectrometry as follows: 1) X, Gal beta 1-4(Fuc alpha 1-3)GlcNAc beta 1-3Gal beta 1-4Glc beta 1-1'Cer, III3FucnLc4 (Lex); 2) Y, Gal beta 1-4(Fuc alpha 1-3)GlcNAc beta 1-3Gal beta 1-4(Fuc alpha 1- 3)GlcNAc beta 1-3Gal beta 1-4Glc beta 1-1'Cer, V3FucIII3FucnLc6; and 3) G, NeuAc alpha 2-3Gal beta 1-4(Fuc alpha 1-3)GlcNAc beta 1-3 Gal-beta 1-4Glc beta 1-1'Cer, IV3NeuAcIII3FucnLc4 (sialosyl-Le(x)). A minor neutral glycolipid Z was isolated and tentatively characterized as GlcNAc beta 1-3?Gal beta 1-4(Fuc alpha 1-3)GlcNAc beta 1-3Gal beta 1-4Glc beta 1-1'Cer (GlcNAc-Le(x)), suggesting that it may be the precursor of glycolipid Y. The major long-chain base of these human cataract glycolipids was C18:0 sphingosine (sphinganine). The major fatty acids were C16:0, C24:1 and C24:0, and monounsaturated fatty acids accounted for 40-55% of the total fatty acids."
https://openalex.org/W1603981222,"The expression of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene under control of the 1152-base pair 5'-flanking region (-1107 to +45 nucleotide positions with respect to the major transcription initiation site) of the Drosophila DNA polymerase alpha gene was repressed by cotransfection into Drosophila Kc cells with a zerknullt (zen)-expressing plasmid as previously observed with the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) gene promoter. The expression of the zen resulted in reduction of the abundance of mRNA for the transfected chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene and also mRNAs for both DNA polymerase alpha and PCNA. Results obtained using various deletion derivatives of the promoter region and chemically synthesized oligonucleotides of the DNA replication-related element (DRE), a positive cis-acting element found in both DNA polymerase alpha and PCNA genes, revealed that the DRE sequences are responsible to repression by Zen protein. The nuclear extract of Kc cells transfected by the zen-expressing plasmid contained lesser amounts of the DRE-binding factor (DREF) than that of untransfected or mutant zen-transfected cells. These results suggest that the Zen protein represses expression of DNA replication-related genes by reducing DREF, although the detailed mechanism of the repression remains to be elucidated."
https://openalex.org/W2408641386,"We have searched for novel genetic alterations in human cancer cell lines by using the arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction (AP-PCR), which is a PCR-based genomic fingerprinting. A homozygous deletion was detected in a small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) cell line, NCI-H82. Since homozygous deletion is a critical genetic alteration for the inactivation of tumor suppressor gene, we defined the locus of homozygous deletion. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis revealed that the deletion was localized at chromosome 2q33. Allelic loss on chromosome 2q was detected in 29.4% (5/17) of SCLC and 37.5% (12/32) one non-SCLC by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Considerably high incidence of allelic loss on chromosome 2q was also detected in colorectal carcinoma and neuroblastoma. These results suggest the presence of a novel tumor suppressor gene at 2q33, which is involved in the development of several human cancers. The size of the homozygous deletion in the NCI-H82 cell line was more than 20 kilobase pairs. Seven loci mapped to 2q32-qter were all retained in this cell line, suggesting the presence of submicroscopic interstitial deletion in this cell line. Homozygous deletion detected in this study should be an invaluable tool for positional cloning of the target tumor suppressor gene at 2q33."

https://openalex.org/W1602443281,"Mammalian cells displaying the multidrug resistance (mdr) phenotype are refractory to the toxic effects of a group of unrelated natural product drugs, many of which are used for cancer chemotherapy. The pattern of cross-resistance can be extremely variable among independently selected cell lines, even though such cells are often exposed to only a single drug. The overexpression of P-glycoprotein (pgp), a 150-180-kDa drug efflux pump, has been shown to confer mdr to otherwise drug-sensitive cells; however, the variable nature of cross-resistance indicates that normal pgps alone are unlikely to account for all of the observed cross-resistance phenotypes. In this report, we examined possible factors contributing to cross-resistance diversity in mammalian cells. We show that drug-resistant Chinese hamster lung cells selected during relatively short periods of drug exposure in vitro (less than 6-8 weeks) routinely overexpressed endogenous pgps and predominantly showed a cross-resistance pattern that was similar to that conferred by the introduction and overexpression of the hamster wild-type pgp1 cDNA alone. Longer drug exposure periods at higher drug concentrations, however, led to the selection of cell lines with altered cross-resistance properties. Like the short term clones, these cell lines all overexpressed endogenous pgp. In one case, the altered phenotype was shown to be caused by the acquisition of point mutations within codons 338 and 339 of the pgp1 gene, leading to two adjacent amino acid substitutions within the encoded pgp. Although the basis for the remaining altered phenotypes remains unknown, these results indicate that additional genetic alterations beyond those responsible for the initial acquisition of mdr emerge in the face of increased selective pressure, thus further modifying or complementing the cross-resistance phenotype initially conferred by wild-type pgp."
https://openalex.org/W338089031,"Mitochondrial 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase (HMG-CoA synthase) is a key enzyme in the ketone body pathway. To determine its role in the regulation of liver ketogenesis, transgenic mice expressing a P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase/HMG-CoA synthase chimeric gene have been obtained. An increase in the concentration of mitochondrial HMG-CoA synthase mRNA was detected in these mice, which was associated with a 3-fold increase in HMG-CoA synthase activity in liver mitochondrial extracts. Transgenic mice were normoglycemic and had normal levels of plasma triglycerides and lower free fatty acids. However, the plasma concentration of ketone bodies was about three times higher in transgenic mice than in control animals. Hepatocytes in primary culture from transgenic mice expressed the chimeric gene in a regulated manner and showed a 3-fold increase in beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate concentrations in the medium. This animal model thus shows that the overexpression of mitochondrial HMG-CoA synthase causes ketone body overproduction, suggesting that this enzyme may be a regulatory step in liver ketogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1530629208,"The hemin-controlled inhibitor, or HCI, is a cyclic nucleotide-independent protein kinase which specifically phosphorylates the alpha subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF-2) leading to potential limitations in functional eIF-2 and decreases in protein synthesis initiation. We have recently demonstrated that hemin regulates eIF-2 alpha kinase activity by promoting formation of the inactive heterodimer between HCI and the 90-kDa heat shock protein (hsp90). The formation of the inactive form of HCI by hemin is prevented by treatment with sulfhydryl reagents such as N-ethylmaleimide or when hsp90 is previously phosphorylated (Mendez, R., Moreno, A., and de Haro, C. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 11500-11507). In this report, using isoelectric focusing and Western blot analyses with antibodies against a synthetic HCI peptide, we have demonstrated that HCI was also phosphorylated when a heme-reversible HCI preparation was preincubated with ATP. Furthermore, our results indicate that casein kinase II (CK II) is the enzyme involved in the regulation of HCI. Thus, the synthetic peptide RRREEETEEE, which is a specific substrate for CK II, acts as a competitive inhibitor of HCI and hsp90 phosphorylation and, at the same time, inhibits the activation of HCI, whereas a synthetic peptide which corresponds to residues 45-59 of the alpha subunit of eIF-2, including the Ser51 phosphorylated by HCI, only inhibits competitively the phosphorylation of eIF-2 alpha. In addition, treatments which modify hsp90 disabling the formation of the inactive dimer with HCI make unnecessary the presence of CK II for activation of HCI. The data strongly suggest that hemin promotes formation of an inactive HCI.hsp90 dimer preventing phosphorylation by CK II. Interestingly, the addition of the CK II peptide substrate also prevents the activation of HCI in a heme-deficient reticulocyte lysate. We hypothesize, therefore, that under physiological conditions, CK II activity appears to be necessary for activation of HCI."

https://openalex.org/W1485232232,"Substrate analogs are used in combination with site-directed mutagenesis to probe specific interactions between substrate and enzyme in the forward and reverse direction of the Escherichia coli maltodextrin phosphorylase reaction. In the phosphorolysis (degradation) mode, removal of the 2-OH group of the terminal glucose of the polysaccharide results in a 30-fold reduction of Km while similar changes were of no influence when the same polysaccharide was used for priming the synthesis. Mutation of active site residues Glu637 or Tyr538 does not change apparent affinity of substrates during degradation. In the synthesis mode, 2-deoxyglucose-1-P as substrate causes a 2-fold reduction of the wild-type kcat/Km while for the Y538F mutant a approximately 7-fold reduction is observed. In contrast, the mutation of Glu637 to Asp causes a 10-fold increase in kcat/Km. Therefore, different binding sites for the terminal glucose residue of the oligosaccharide and glucose-1-P exist. Glu637 and Tyr538 are part of the glucose-1-P binding site and do not interact with the terminal glucose residue. A 2-fold increase in rate was observed in both directions using the 2-deoxy derivatives. This confirms the role of intrinsic electronic effects in stabilizing the transition state. Uncompetitive substrate inhibition at high concentrations of maltoheptaose in the phosphorolysis direction is explained by inhibitory binding of the sugar in the synthesis mode."
https://openalex.org/W2082633404,"FMRFamide evokes long-term inhibition of the sensorimotor connection of Aplysia that includes structural alterations in the presynaptic sensory cell. FMRFamide also evokes a down-regulation of the adhesion molecule apCAM from the surface of the postsynaptic motor cell L7. We examined the second messenger pathways mediating the long-term actions of FMRFamide on both the pre- and postsynaptic cells and determined whether the activation of each pathway is required for the expression of long-term functional and structural plasticity. Inhibition of the lipoxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism, but not the cyclooxygenase pathway, blocks the long-term changes in the presynaptic sensory cell evoked by FMRFamide. The down-regulation of apCAM in L7 appears to be mediated by cAMP-dependent activation of protein kinase A. Blocking the cAMP-dependent changes also blocks FMRFamide-induced long-term functional and structural changes. These results suggest that the expression of long-term heterosynaptic inhibition in Aplysia may require concomitant presynaptic and postsynaptic changes, each transduced by specific second messenger systems."
https://openalex.org/W1650316802,"Mutations in the AMP binding site of porcine fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase were carried out by site-specific mutagenesis based on the crystal structure of the enzyme (Ke, H., Zhang, Y., and Lipscomb, W.L. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 87, 5243-5247). The mutant and wild-type enzymes were characterized by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, circular dichroism spectrometry, and initial rate kinetics. One of the mutant forms of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, Glu-29-->Gln, is ligated to the phosphoryl moiety of AMP, a potent inhibitor of the reaction, whereas the other mutant, Thr-31-->Val, is associated with the purine base of AMP. No discernible alteration in structure as measured by circular dichroism spectrometry was noted for the mutants relative to the wild-type enzyme. As expected, major changes in kinetic parameters between the mutants and the wild-type enzyme were associated with inhibition by AMP. AMP, a competitive inhibitor with respect to Mg2+ in the fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase reaction, exhibits cooperativity in the case of the wild-type and the mutant Thr-31-->Val enzymes with a Hill coefficient of 2.0. On the other hand, cooperativity is completely lost in the case of Glu-29-->Gln fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase."
https://openalex.org/W1585354308,"Two type II regulatory (R) subunits of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) of 50 and 47 kDa have been identified in Aplysia neurons by several criteria which include phosphorylation by the catalytic subunit of PKA and nanomolar affinity for a peptide fragment of the human thyroid protein Ht 31, properties that in mammals distinguish type II from type I R subunits. The neuronal type II R subunits are differentially localized within cells. For example, the 50-kDa polypeptide is enriched in taxol-stabilized microtubules. In addition, at least seven high molecular mass neuronal RII-binding proteins ranging in mass from 110 to 420 kDa have been demonstrated by a blot overlay technique, which uses 32P-labeled bovine RII alpha as a probe. The RII-binding proteins also exhibit discrete patterns of subcellular localization. For example, the 420 kDa species is enriched in taxol-stabilized microtubules and therefore may serve to anchor the 50-kDa RII subunit. The localization of PKA through the association of RII subunits with the binding proteins may anchor the multifunctional kinase close to key substrates and thereby contribute to the spatial organization required to mediate the orderly phosphorylation events that underly neuronal modulation."
https://openalex.org/W1741910016,"Factor IX is a vitamin K-dependent procoagulant zymogen of a serine protease. In the presence of Ca2+ the active form of factor IX (factor IXa beta) forms a complex with factor VIIIa on suitable phospholipid surfaces such as aggregated platelets. This macromolecular complex rapidly activates factor X. We have previously provided data that suggest an interaction between the NH2-terminal epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like module of factor IXa beta and the substrate factor X. In an alternative approach to study this protein-protein interaction, we have expressed three recombinant baculovirus constructs encoding the EGF-like modules of human factor IX and a truncated form of fibronectin in a system based on the infection of insect cells (Spodoptera frugiperda 21). This strategy allows a simple one-step purification of the recombinant proteins on a gelatin-Sepharose column, followed by removal of the gelatin-binding part derived from fibronectin by proteolytic cleavage. The fusion proteins were isolated at yields of 20-50 micrograms/ml culture medium. The recombinant EGF-like modules contained 0.2-0.4 mol of erythro-beta-hydroxyaspartic acid/mol of protein, i.e. similar to the amount found in factor IX from human plasma, and appeared to be glycosylated at Ser-53. The NH2-terminal EGF-like module, which contained a transamidation acceptor site derived from fibronectin, was cross-linked by factor XIIIa in solution to intact and Gla-domainless factor X. There was no evidence of cross-linking to activated factor X or to factor X fragments containing only the gamma-carboxyglutamic acid module and the two EGF-like modules. The cross-linking results suggest a specific interaction between the NH2-terminal EGF-like module of factor IXa beta and the heavy chain of unactivated factor X. This interaction, albeit weak as judged by competition experiments, may be important for the targeting of factor X to the factor IXa beta-factor VIIIa complex on biological membranes and for the subsequent dissociation of factor Xa from the complex after activation."
