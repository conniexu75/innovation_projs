https://openalex.org/W2087500144,WE have suggested elsewhere1 the possibility of artificial heterogenization of malignant tumours by induction in tumour cells of new antigen determinants followed by exposure of these antigens to actively acquired or passively administered lymphoid cells or antibodies.
https://openalex.org/W2059761600,"A RECENT communication1 reported the isolation of o-hydroxyphenoxyacetic acid as the main acidic product from the metabolism of phenoxyacetic acid by A. niger, using a replacement culture technique. Since these findings contrasted with our earlier work2 in which both o- and p-hydroxyphenoxyacetic acids had been isolated, it was thought advisable to re-investigate the problem."

https://openalex.org/W1967992814,"COMPARATIVE investigations of the clearance of injected bacteriophage from the circulation of several species of animal have been carried out. Clearance from the chicken, frog and from certain elasmobranch, holostean and teleost fish was very rapid and was associated with the development of neutralizing antibody1,2. In the cyclostomes Petromyzon marinus and Eptatretus stoutii clearance was relatively slow, and little or no neutralizing ability developed in the serum of injected animals2. The insect Samia cecropia cleared 90 per cent or more of the injected dose of bacteriophage from the Hæmolymph between the second and the tenth hour, but no neutralizing activity appeared to develop3. Accelerated secondary clearance has been demonstrated in the chicken, the frog and in some fish, but was not tested in the insect. The following preliminary experiments were carried out to investigate primary and secondary clearance of bacteriophage in other invertebrates as part of an investigation in comparative immunology."

S. marcescens can receive2,3 lac+ genes from E. coli and Salmonella typhosa via an episomic vector and may in turn transmit these genes to S. typhimurium and Sh. dysenteriae."

https://openalex.org/W2040532765,"HEATING of bone to 325° C has been shown to induce the formation of pyrophosphate1–3. The quantity of pyrophosphate so formed is greater in the epiphysis than in the diaphysis and greater in the younger than in the older animal, and is therefore presumably greater in newly laid down than in older bone salt1. The question to be investigated is whether pyrophosphate-yielding mineral of new bone has specific chemical characteristics. There is much evidence which suggests that the tetracyclines are deposited in high concentrations in newly formed bone salt4. This communication demonstrates that the tetracycline labels the form of the bone salt that yields pyrophosphate in large amounts after heating."

https://openalex.org/W1973135683,"WE have shown1 that β-hydroxybutyrate does not induce secretion of insulin in vitro as does glucose or citrate. Newsholme, Randle and Manchester2 have observed a diminution of uptake of glucose (perfused heart) in the presence of β-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate and octonoate. They conclude that these substrates inhibit uptake of glucose by inhibiting the intracellular phosphorylation of glucose by hexokinase and the phosphofructokinase reaction. According to Passonneau and Lowry3 phosphofructokinase is responsive to the balance between ∼P expenditure and ∼P formation. In view of those results we decided to ascertain the effect of glucose on insulin secretion in vitro by rabbit pancreas pre-treated with β-hydroxybutyrate."

It is important to note that the same effect has been obtained from citrated human plasma and is best observed with dialysed plasma, since dialysis eliminates the quick contracting agents2. The chemical nature of G acid prompted a search for a possible precursor of this lipid-soluble unsaturated fatty acid (3-octadecenoic acid)1."

https://openalex.org/W2056476249,"FORMATION of lymphoid follicles with light germinal centres is generally considered as being characteristic of myasthenia gravis1 and is regarded as one of the manifestations of the auto-immune nature of this disease2. However, quite similar changes are induced in the thymus with no symptoms of myasthenia by subcutaneous injection of Freund's adjuvant3 or through direct administration to the thymus of various antigens4, proving only that the thymus is involved in every enhanced immunization process. On the other hand, the relationship of myasthenia gravis to thymus pathology is beyond any doubt; yet the nature of this relationship is obscure."
