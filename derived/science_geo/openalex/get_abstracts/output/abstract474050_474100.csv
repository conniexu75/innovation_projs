https://openalex.org/W1993793414,"A prospective longitudinal study identifies the earliest known indicator of social disability in human infancy: decline in attention to others’ eyes in infants who are later diagnosed with autism; the decline is evident already within the first 2 to 6 months of life, which reveals the early unfolding of the disorder but also offers a promising opportunity for the future of early intervention. A reduced tendency to make eye contact is a feature of autistic spectrum disorders (ASDs). It is used as a diagnostic marker, but it is not known when this behaviour arises. In a long-term study of 59 infants at high risk for ASD, and 51 at low risk, Warren Jones and Ami Klin tracked the development of eye movement in children through their first 3 years of life. Early levels of eye contact were normal in children eventually diagnosed with autism, but from soon after 2 months of age, eye contact behaviour declines. These findings may represent some of the earliest manifestations of autistic symptoms, but need to be replicated in an independent sample before being considered a potential diagnostic marker. Deficits in eye contact have been a hallmark of autism1,2 since the condition’s initial description3. They are cited widely as a diagnostic feature4 and figure prominently in clinical instruments5; however, the early onset of these deficits has not been known. Here we show in a prospective longitudinal study that infants later diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) exhibit mean decline in eye fixation from 2 to 6 months of age, a pattern not observed in infants who do not develop ASD. These observations mark the earliest known indicators of social disability in infancy, but also falsify a prior hypothesis: in the first months of life, this basic mechanism of social adaptive action—eye looking—is not immediately diminished in infants later diagnosed with ASD; instead, eye looking appears to begin at normative levels prior to decline. The timing of decline highlights a narrow developmental window and reveals the early derailment of processes that would otherwise have a key role in canalizing typical social development. Finally, the observation of this decline in eye fixation—rather than outright absence—offers a promising opportunity for early intervention that could build on the apparent preservation of mechanisms subserving reflexive initial orientation towards the eyes."
https://openalex.org/W2112789125,"Cellular plasticity contributes to the regenerative capacity of plants, invertebrates, teleost fishes and amphibians. In vertebrates, differentiated cells are known to revert into replicating progenitors, but these cells do not persist as stable stem cells. Here we present evidence that differentiated airway epithelial cells can revert into stable and functional stem cells in vivo. After the ablation of airway stem cells, we observed a surprising increase in the proliferation of committed secretory cells. Subsequent lineage tracing demonstrated that the luminal secretory cells had dedifferentiated into basal stem cells. Dedifferentiated cells were morphologically indistinguishable from stem cells and they functioned as well as their endogenous counterparts in repairing epithelial injury. Single secretory cells clonally dedifferentiated into multipotent stem cells when they were cultured ex vivo without basal stem cells. By contrast, direct contact with a single basal stem cell was sufficient to prevent secretory cell dedifferentiation. In analogy to classical descriptions of amphibian nuclear reprogramming, the propensity of committed cells to dedifferentiate is inversely correlated to their state of maturity. This capacity of committed cells to dedifferentiate into stem cells may have a more general role in the regeneration of many tissues and in multiple disease states, notably cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2077915242,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 is able to replicate in primary human macrophages without stimulating innate immunity despite reverse transcription of genomic RNA into double-stranded DNA, an activity that might be expected to trigger innate pattern recognition receptors. We reasoned that if correctly orchestrated HIV-1 uncoating and nuclear entry is important for evasion of innate sensors then manipulation of specific interactions between HIV-1 capsid and host factors that putatively regulate these processes should trigger pattern recognition receptors and stimulate type 1 interferon (IFN) secretion. Here we show that HIV-1 capsid mutants N74D and P90A, which are impaired for interaction with cofactors cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor subunit 6 (CPSF6) and cyclophilins (Nup358 and CypA), respectively, cannot replicate in primary human monocyte-derived macrophages because they trigger innate sensors leading to nuclear translocation of NF-κB and IRF3, the production of soluble type 1 IFN and induction of an antiviral state. Depletion of CPSF6 with short hairpin RNA expression allows wild-type virus to trigger innate sensors and IFN production. In each case, suppressed replication is rescued by IFN-receptor blockade, demonstrating a role for IFN in restriction. IFN production is dependent on viral reverse transcription but not integration, indicating that a viral reverse transcription product comprises the HIV-1 pathogen-associated molecular pattern. Finally, we show that we can pharmacologically induce wild-type HIV-1 infection to stimulate IFN secretion and an antiviral state using a non-immunosuppressive cyclosporine analogue. We conclude that HIV-1 has evolved to use CPSF6 and cyclophilins to cloak its replication, allowing evasion of innate immune sensors and induction of a cell-autonomous innate immune response in primary human macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W2093083882,"The damage caused by the asteroid 17–20 metres in diameter that exploded over Chelyabinsk, Russia, on 15 February 2013 is estimated here to have an energy equivalent to about 500 kilotons of TNT. The fireball that streaked across the skies above Chelyabinsk in Russia on 15 February 2013 is providing astronomers with a wealth of information. Two papers in this issue present detailed reconstructions of the Chelyabinsk event. From an analysis of videos, Jiří Borovička et al. determined the trajectory and velocity of the superbolide with high precision. Its orbit was similar to that of the 2-kilometre-diameter asteroid 86039 (1999 NC43), suggesting that the two bodies may be part of the same asteroid family. And they show that it broke into small pieces between the altitudes of 45 and 30 kilometres. In the companion paper, Peter Brown et al. analysed the damage caused by the airburst which they estimate was equivalent in energy to the detonation of 400 to 600 kilotons of TNT. They suggest that the number of impactors with diameters of tens of metres was an order of magnitude higher than current estimates, shifting much of the residual impact risk to these sizes. Most large (over a kilometre in diameter) near-Earth asteroids are now known, but recognition that airbursts (or fireballs resulting from nuclear-weapon-sized detonations of meteoroids in the atmosphere) have the potential to do greater damage1 than previously thought has shifted an increasing portion of the residual impact risk (the risk of impact from an unknown object) to smaller objects2. Above the threshold size of impactor at which the atmosphere absorbs sufficient energy to prevent a ground impact, most of the damage is thought to be caused by the airburst shock wave3, but owing to lack of observations this is uncertain4,5. Here we report an analysis of the damage from the airburst of an asteroid about 19 metres (17 to 20 metres) in diameter southeast of Chelyabinsk, Russia, on 15 February 2013, estimated to have an energy equivalent of approximately 500 (±100) kilotons of trinitrotoluene (TNT, where 1 kiloton of TNT = 4.185×1012 joules). We show that a widely referenced technique4,5,6 of estimating airburst damage does not reproduce the observations, and that the mathematical relations7 based on the effects of nuclear weapons—almost always used with this technique—overestimate blast damage. This suggests that earlier damage estimates5,6 near the threshold impactor size are too high. We performed a global survey of airbursts of a kiloton or more (including Chelyabinsk), and find that the number of impactors with diameters of tens of metres may be an order of magnitude higher than estimates based on other techniques8,9. This suggests a non-equilibrium (if the population were in a long-term collisional steady state the size-frequency distribution would either follow a single power law or there must be a size-dependent bias in other surveys) in the near-Earth asteroid population for objects 10 to 50 metres in diameter, and shifts more of the residual impact risk to these sizes."
https://openalex.org/W1991471550,"Newborn infants are highly susceptible to infection. This defect in host defence has generally been ascribed to the immaturity of neonatal immune cells; however, the degree of hyporesponsiveness is highly variable and depends on the stimulation conditions. These discordant responses illustrate the need for a more unified explanation for why immunity is compromised in neonates. Here we show that physiologically enriched CD71(+) erythroid cells in neonatal mice and human cord blood have distinctive immunosuppressive properties. The production of innate immune protective cytokines by adult cells is diminished after transfer to neonatal mice or after co-culture with neonatal splenocytes. Neonatal CD71(+) cells express the enzyme arginase-2, and arginase activity is essential for the immunosuppressive properties of these cells because molecular inhibition of this enzyme or supplementation with L-arginine overrides immunosuppression. In addition, the ablation of CD71(+) cells in neonatal mice, or the decline in number of these cells as postnatal development progresses parallels the loss of suppression, and restored resistance to the perinatal pathogens Listeria monocytogenes and Escherichia coli. However, CD71(+) cell-mediated susceptibility to infection is counterbalanced by CD71(+) cell-mediated protection against aberrant immune cell activation in the intestine, where colonization with commensal microorganisms occurs swiftly after parturition. Conversely, circumventing such colonization by using antimicrobials or gnotobiotic germ-free mice overrides these protective benefits. Thus, CD71(+) cells quench the excessive inflammation induced by abrupt colonization with commensal microorganisms after parturition. This finding challenges the idea that the susceptibility of neonates to infection reflects immune-cell-intrinsic defects and instead highlights processes that are developmentally more essential and inadvertently mitigate innate immune protection. We anticipate that these results will spark renewed investigation into the need for immunosuppression in neonates, as well as improved strategies for augmenting host defence in this vulnerable population."
https://openalex.org/W2035133245,"In nuclear pre-messenger RNA splicing, introns are excised by the spliceosome, a dynamic machine composed of both proteins and small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs). Over thirty years ago, after the discovery of self-splicing group II intron RNAs, the snRNAs were proposed to catalyse splicing. However, no definitive evidence for a role of either RNA or protein in catalysis by the spliceosome has been reported so far. By using metal rescue strategies in spliceosomes from budding yeast, here we show that the U6 snRNA catalyses both of the two splicing reactions by positioning divalent metals that stabilize the leaving groups during each reaction. Notably, all of the U6 catalytic metal ligands we identified correspond to the ligands observed to position catalytic, divalent metals in crystal structures of a group II intron RNA. These findings indicate that group II introns and the spliceosome share common catalytic mechanisms and probably common evolutionary origins. Our results demonstrate that RNA mediates catalysis within the spliceosome."
https://openalex.org/W2063020711,"Brown adipose tissue-enriched lysine methyltransferase EHMT1 is an essential enzyme in the PRDM16–C/EBP-β transcriptional complex that controls brown adipose cell fate and energy metabolism. Here it is shown that euchromatic histone-lysine N-methyltransferase 1 (EHMT1), an enzyme found at increased levels in brown adipose tissue (BAT), is an essential component of the PRDM16 transcriptional complex that controls brown adipose cell fate. Loss of EHMT1 in brown adipocytes results in loss of brown fat characteristics and induces muscle differentiation in vivo through demethylation of histone 3 Lys 9 in the muscle-selective gene promoters. By contrast, EHMT1 expression switches on the thermogenic gene program in brown adipocytes by stabilizing the PRDM16 protein. Adipose-specific deletion of EHMT1 reduces BAT-mediated adaptive thermogenesis, and causes obesity and insulin resistance. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) dissipates chemical energy in the form of heat as a defence against hypothermia and obesity. Current evidence indicates that brown adipocytes arise from Myf5+ dermotomal precursors through the action of PR domain containing protein 16 (PRDM16) transcriptional complex1,2. However, the enzymatic component of the molecular switch that determines lineage specification of brown adipocytes remains unknown. Here we show that euchromatic histone-lysine N-methyltransferase 1 (EHMT1) is an essential BAT-enriched lysine methyltransferase in the PRDM16 transcriptional complex and controls brown adipose cell fate. Loss of EHMT1 in brown adipocytes causes a severe loss of brown fat characteristics and induces muscle differentiation in vivo through demethylation of histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9me2 and 3) of the muscle-selective gene promoters. Conversely, EHMT1 expression positively regulates the BAT-selective thermogenic program by stabilizing the PRDM16 protein. Notably, adipose-specific deletion of EHMT1 leads to a marked reduction of BAT-mediated adaptive thermogenesis, obesity and systemic insulin resistance. These data indicate that EHMT1 is an essential enzymatic switch that controls brown adipose cell fate and energy homeostasis."

https://openalex.org/W2093249646,"The role that epistasis — non-additive interactions between alleles — plays in shaping population fitness is investigated in Drosophila melanogaster; the raw material to drive reproductive isolation is found to be segregating contemporaneously within species and does not necessarily require the emergence of incompatible mutations independently derived and fixed in allopatry. Working in Drosophila melanogaster recombinant inbred lines, these authors take on the issue of the role of epistasis — non-additive interactions between alleles — in shaping population fitness. They find that the raw material to drive reproductive isolation is segregating contemporaneously within species, and does not necessarily require the emergence of incompatible mutations independently derived and fixed by geographic separation. This observation has important implications for speciation genetics; it also demonstrates that epistasis is widespread but that it may often go undetected. The importance of epistasis—non-additive interactions between alleles—in shaping population fitness has long been a controversial topic, hampered in part by lack of empirical evidence1,2,3,4. Traditionally, epistasis is inferred on the basis of non-independence of genotypic values between loci for a given trait. However, epistasis for fitness should also have a genomic footprint5,6,7. To capture this signal, we have developed a simple approach that relies on detecting genotype ratio distortion as a sign of epistasis, and we apply this method to a large panel of Drosophila melanogaster recombinant inbred lines8,9. Here we confirm experimentally that instances of genotype ratio distortion represent loci with epistatic fitness effects; we conservatively estimate that any two haploid genomes in this study are expected to harbour 1.15 pairs of epistatically interacting alleles. This observation has important implications for speciation genetics, as it indicates that the raw material to drive reproductive isolation is segregating contemporaneously within species and does not necessarily require, as proposed by the Dobzhansky–Muller model, the emergence of incompatible mutations independently derived and fixed in allopatry. The relevance of our result extends beyond speciation, as it demonstrates that epistasis is widespread but that it may often go undetected owing to lack of statistical power or lack of genome-wide scope of the experiments."
https://openalex.org/W1979058246,"This study focuses on the effects of short-term [22 s, parabolic flight campaign (PFC)] and long-term (10 d, Shenzhou 8 space mission) real microgravity on changes in cytokine secretion and gene expression patterns in poorly differentiated thyroid cancer cells. FTC-133 cells were cultured in space and on a random positioning machine (RPM) for 10 d, to evaluate differences between real and simulated microgravity. Multianalyte profiling was used to evaluate 128 secreted cytokines. Microarray analysis revealed 63 significantly regulated transcripts after 22 s of microgravity during a PFC and 2881 after 10 d on the RPM or in space. Genes in several biological processes, including apoptosis (n=182), cytoskeleton (n=80), adhesion/extracellular matrix (n=98), proliferation (n=184), stress response (n=268), migration (n=63), angiogenesis (n=39), and signal transduction (n=429), were differentially expressed. Genes and proteins involved in the regulation of cancer cell proliferation and metastasis, such as IL6, IL8, IL15, OPN, VEGFA, VEGFD, FGF17, MMP2, MMP3, TIMP1, PRKAA, and PRKACA, were similarly regulated under RPM and spaceflight conditions. The resulting effect was mostly antiproliferative. Gene expression during the PFC was often regulated in the opposite direction. In summary, microgravity is an invaluable tool for exploring new targets in anticancer therapy and can be simulated in some aspects in ground-based facilities."

https://openalex.org/W1982948902,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis triggers a strong innate immune response characterized by excessive neutrophil infiltration which contributes to RSV induced pathology. The cytokine IL-17A enhances neutrophil infiltration into virus infected lungs. IL-17A is however best known as an effector of adaptive immune responses. The role of IL-17A in early immune modulation in RSV infection is unknown. We aimed to elucidate whether local IL-17A facilitates the innate neutrophil infiltration into RSV infected lungs prior to adaptive immunity. To this end, we studied IL-17A production in newborns that were hospitalized for severe RSV bronchiolitis. In tracheal aspirates we measured IL-17A concentration and neutrophil counts. We utilized cultured human epithelial cells to test if IL-17A regulates RSV infection-induced IL-8 release as mediator of neutrophil recruitment. In mice we investigated the cell types that are responsible for early innate IL-17A production during RSV infection. Using IL-17A neutralizing antibodies we tested if IL-17A is responsible for innate neutrophil infiltration in mice. Our data show that increased IL-17A production in newborn RSV patient lungs correlates with subsequent neutrophil counts recruited to the lungs. IL-17A potentiates RSV-induced production of the neutrophil-attracting chemokine IL-8 by airway epithelial cells in vitro. Various lung-resident lymphocytes produced IL-17A during early RSV infection in Balb/c mice, of which a local population of CD4 T cells stood out as the predominant RSV-induced cell type. By removing IL-17A during early RSV infection in mice we showed that IL-17A is responsible for enhanced innate neutrophil infiltration in vivo. Using patient material, in vitro studies, and an animal model of RSV infection, we thus show that early local IL-17A production in the airways during RSV bronchiolitis facilitates neutrophil recruitment with pathologic consequences to infant lungs."
https://openalex.org/W2090837200,"Acyl carrier protein represents one of the most highly conserved proteins across all domains of life and is nature's way of transporting hydrocarbon chains in vivo. Notably, type II acyl carrier proteins serve as a crucial interaction hub in primary cellular metabolism by communicating transiently between partner enzymes of the numerous biosynthetic pathways. However, the highly transient nature of such interactions and the inherent conformational mobility of acyl carrier protein have stymied previous attempts to visualize structurally acyl carrier protein tied to an overall catalytic cycle. This is essential to understanding a fundamental aspect of cellular metabolism leading to compounds that are not only useful to the cell, but also of therapeutic value. For example, acyl carrier protein is central to the biosynthesis of the lipid A (endotoxin) component of lipopolysaccharides in Gram-negative microorganisms, which is required for their growth and survival, and is an activator of the mammalian host's immune system, thus emerging as an important therapeutic target. During lipid A synthesis (Raetz pathway), acyl carrier protein shuttles acyl intermediates linked to its prosthetic 4'-phosphopantetheine group among four acyltransferases, including LpxD. Here we report the crystal structures of three forms of Escherichia coli acyl carrier protein engaging LpxD, which represent stalled substrate and liberated products along the reaction coordinate. The structures show the intricate interactions at the interface that optimally position acyl carrier protein for acyl delivery and that directly involve the pantetheinyl group. Conformational differences among the stalled acyl carrier proteins provide the molecular basis for the association-dissociation process. An unanticipated conformational shift of 4'-phosphopantetheine groups within the LpxD catalytic chamber shows an unprecedented role of acyl carrier protein in product release."
https://openalex.org/W2031440955,"Approximately 30% of patients with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) display chemoresistance to cisplatin-based regimens, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1), a functional homologue of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family, contributes substantially to the oncogenic potential of EBV through the activation of multiple signaling pathways, and it is closely associated with a poorer prognosis for NPC. Recent studies show that EBV infection can induce the expression of many cellular miRNAs, including microRNA-21, a biomarker for chemoresistance. However, neither a link between LMP1 expression and miR-21 upregulation nor their cross talk in affecting chemoresistance to cisplatin have been reported. Here, we observed that stable LMP1-transformed NPC cells were less sensitive to cisplatin treatment based on their proliferation, colony formation, the IC50 value of cisplatin and the apoptosis index. Higher levels of miR-21 were found in EBV-carrying and LMP1-positive cell lines, suggesting that LMP1 may be linked to miR-21 upregulation. These data were confirmed by our results that exogenous LMP1 increased miR-21 in both transiently and stably LMP1-transfected cells, and the knock down of miR-21 substantially reversed the resistance of the NPC cells to cisplatin treatment. Moreover, the proapoptotic factors programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4) and Fas ligand (Fas-L), which were negatively regulated by miR-21, were found to play an important role in the program of LMP1-dependent cisplatin resistance. Finally, we demonstrated that LMP1 induced miR-21 expression primarily by modulating the PI3K/AKT/FOXO3a signaling pathway. Taken together, we revealed for the first time that viral LMP1 triggers the PI3K/Akt/FOXO3a pathway to induce human miR-21 expression, which subsequently decreases the expression of PDCD4 and Fas-L, and results in chemoresistance in NPC cells."

Normal human pancreas tissue samples were obtained through a cadaveric organ donation program. 1) Validation of COL11A1 gene overexpression by q-RT-PCR.the expression of COL11A1 gene is significantly increased in PDAC samples vs. normal and CP samples. 2) Analysis of COL11A1 by immunohistochemistry using highly specific anti-proCOL11A1 antibodies.anti-proCOL11A1 stains stromal cells/cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) of PDAC but it does not stain chronic benign condition (chronic pancreatitis) stromal cells, epithelial cells, or normal fibroblasts. 3) Evaluation of the discrimination ability of the antibody.anti-proCOL11A1 immunostaining accurately discriminates between PDAC and CP (AUC 0.936, 95% CI 0.851, 0.981). 4) Phenotypic characterization of proCOL11A1+ stromal cells co-staining with mesenchymal, epithelial and stellate cell markers on pancreatic tissue samples and cultured peritumoral pancreatic cancer stromal cells.ProCOL11A1+ cells present co-staining with mesenchymal, stellate and epithelial markers (EMT phenotype) in different proportions.Detection of proCOL11A1 through immunostaining with this newly-developed antibody allows for a highly accurate distinction between PDAC and CP. Unlike other available antibodies commonly used to detect CAFs, anti-proCOL11A1 is negative in stromal cells of the normal pancreas and almost absent in benign inflammation. These results strongly suggest that proCOL11A1 is a specific marker for CAFs, and thus, anti-proCOL11A1 is a powerful new tool for cancer research and clinical diagnostics."
https://openalex.org/W2124704338,"In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the synthesis of phospholipids in the exponential phase of growth occurs at the expense of the storage lipid triacylglycerol. As exponential phase cells progress into the stationary phase, the synthesis of triacylglycerol occurs at the expense of phospholipids. Early work indicates a role of the phosphatidate phosphatase (PAP) in this metabolism; the enzyme produces the diacylglycerol needed for the synthesis of triacylglycerol and simultaneously controls the level of phosphatidate for the synthesis of phospholipids. Four genes (APP1, DPP1, LPP1, and PAH1) encode PAP activity in yeast, and it has been unclear which gene is responsible for the synthesis of triacylglycerol throughout growth. An analysis of lipid synthesis and composition, as well as PAP activity in various PAP mutant strains, showed the essential role of PAH1 in triacylglycerol synthesis throughout growth. Pah1p is a phosphorylated enzyme whose in vivo function is dependent on its dephosphorylation by the Nem1p-Spo7p protein phosphatase complex. nem1Δ mutant cells exhibited defects in triacylglycerol synthesis and lipid metabolism that mirrored those imparted by the pah1Δ mutation, substantiating the importance of Pah1p dephosphorylation throughout growth. An analysis of cells bearing PPAH1-lacZ and PPAH1-DPP1 reporter genes showed that PAH1 expression was induced throughout growth and that the induction in the stationary phase was stimulated by inositol supplementation. A mutant analysis indicated that the Ino2p/Ino4p/Opi1p regulatory circuit and transcription factors Gis1p and Rph1p mediated this regulation."

Furthermore, interactions were found between IL10, IL1b, and PTGS2 and diet and lifestyle factors in relation to CRC. The present study demonstrates that gene-environment interactions may identify genes and environmental factors involved in colorectal carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1986978677,"In this work, we demonstrated the regulation of glucose transporters by hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) activation in renal epithelial cells. LLC-PK1 monolayers were incubated for 1, 3, 6, or 12 h with 0% or 5% O2 or 300 μm cobalt (CoCl2). We evaluated the effects of hypoxia on the mRNA and protein expression of HIF-1α and of the glucose transporters SGLT1, SGLT2, and GLUT1. The data showed an increase in HIF-1α mRNA and protein expression under the three evaluated conditions (p < 0.05 versus t = 0). An increase in GLUT1 mRNA (12 h) and protein expression (at 3, 6, and 12 h) was observed (p < 0.05 versus t = 0). SGLT1 and SGLT2 mRNA and protein expression decreased under the three evaluated conditions (p < 0.05 versus t = 0). In conclusion, our results suggest a clear decrease in the expression of the glucose transporters SGLT1 and SGLT2 under hypoxic conditions which implies a possible correlation with increased expression of HIF-1α."
https://openalex.org/W2011192164,"The human frontal lobe has undergone accelerated evolution, leading to the development of unique human features such as language and self-reflection. Cortical grey matter and underlying white matter reflect distinct cellular compositions in the frontal lobe. Surprisingly little is known about the transcriptomal landscape of these distinct regions. Here, for the first time, we report a detailed transcriptomal profile of the frontal grey (GM) and white matter (WM) with resolution to alternatively spliced isoforms obtained using the RNA-Seq approach. We observed more vigorous transcriptome activity in GM compared to WM, presumably because of the presence of cellular bodies of neurons in the GM and RNA associated with the nucleus and perinuclear space. Among the top differentially expressed genes, we also identified a number of long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs), specifically expressed in white matter, such as LINC00162. Furthermore, along with confirmation of expression of known markers for neurons and oligodendrocytes, we identified a number of genes and splicing isoforms that are exclusively expressed in GM or WM with examples of GABRB2 and PAK2 transcripts, respectively. Pathway analysis identified distinct physiological and biochemical processes specific to grey and white matter samples with a prevalence of synaptic processes in GM and myelination regulation and axonogenesis in the WM. Our study also revealed that expression of many genes, for example, the GPR123, is characterized by isoform switching, depending in which structure the gene is expressed. Our report clearly shows that GM and WM have perhaps surprisingly divergent transcriptome profiles, reflecting distinct roles in brain physiology. Further, this study provides the first reference data set for a normal human frontal lobe, which will be useful in comparative transcriptome studies of cerebral disorders, in particular, neurodegenerative diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1984338291,"To test if proteolysis is involved in tumor cell extravasation, we developed an in vitro model where tumor cells cross an endothelial monolayer cultured on a basement membrane. Using this model we classified the ability of the cells to transmigrate through the endothelial cell barrier onto the underlying matrix, and scored this invasion according to the stage of passage through the endothelium. Metalloproteinase inhibitors reduced tumor cell extravasation by at least 35%. Visualization of protease and cell adhesion molecules by confocal microscopy demonstrated the cell surface localization of MMP-2, MMP-9, MT1-MMP, furin, CD44 and αvβ3, during the process of transendothelial migration. By the addition of inhibitors and bio-modulators we assessed the functional requirement of the aforementioned molecules for efficient migration. Proteolytic digestion occurred at the cell-matrix interface and was most evident during the migratory stage. All of the inhibitors and biomodulators affected the transition of the tumor cells into the migratory stage, highlighting the most prevalent use of proteolysis at this particular step of tumor cell extravasation. These data suggest that a proteolytic interface operates at the tumor cell surface within the tumor-endothelial cell microenvironment."

Questionnaires were used to collect data on sociodemographic characteristics and other risk factors for anaemia.In total, 1449 people participated (response rate 72.3%). The overall prevalence of anaemia was 20.3 % (95% CI 18.2-22.3%), and this was higher for males (24.1%, 95% CI=20.7-27.7%) than females (17.5%, 95% CI=15.0-20.1%). In males, the prevalence of anaemia increased rapidly with age almost doubling between 50 and 65 years (p-trend<0.001). Unexplained anaemia was responsible for more than half of all cases (59.7%). Anaemia was independently associated with infections including malaria (OR 3.49, 95% CI 1.78-6.82), HIV (OR 2.17, 1.32-3.57) heavy hookworm infection (OR 3.45, 1.73-6.91), low fruit consumption (OR 1.55, 1.05-2.29) and being unmarried (OR 1.37 , 95% CI 1.01-1.89). However, the odds of anaemia were lower among older people with elevated blood pressure (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.29-0.77).Anaemia control programmes in Uganda should target older people and should include interventions to treat and control hookworms and educational programs on diets that enhance iron absorption. Clinicians should consider screening older people with HIV or malaria for anaemia. Further studies should be done on unexplained anaemia and serum ferritin levels that predict iron deficiency anaemia in older people."

So far, however, the production level of pullulanase is still somewhat low from wide-type strains and even heterologous expression systems. Here the gene encoding Bacillus naganoensis pullulanase was amplified and cloned. For expression of the protein, two recombinant systems, Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)/pET-20b(+)-pul and E. coli BL21(DE3)/pET-22b(+)-pul, were constructed, both bearing T7 promoter and signal peptide sequence, but different in the existance of lac operator and lacI gene encoding lac repressor. Recombinant pullulanase was initially expressed with the activity of up to 14 U/mL by E. coli BL21(DE3)/pET-20b(+)-pul with IPTG induction in LB medium, but its expression level reduced continually with the extension of cryopreservation time and basal expression was observed. However, E. coli BL21(DE3)/pET-22b(+)-pul , involving lac operator downstream of T7 promoter to regulate foreign gene transcription, exhibited pullulanase activity consistently without detected basal expression. By investigating the effect of lac operator, basal expression of foreign protein was found to cause expression instability and negative effect on production of target protein. Thus double-repression strategy was proposed that lac operators in both chromosome and plasmid were bound with lac repressor to repress T7 RNA polymerase synthesis and target protein expression before induction. Consequently, the total activity of pullulanase was remarkably increased to 580 U/mL with auto-induction by lac operator-involved E. coli BL21(DE3)/pET-22b(+)-pul. When adding 0.6% glycine in culture, the extracellular production of pullulanase was significantly improved with the extracellular activity of 502 U/mL, which is a relatively higher level achieved to date for extracellular production of pullulanase. The successful expression of pullulanase with lac operator regulation provides an efficient way for enhancement of expression stability and hence high-level production of target protein in recombinant E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W2041496427,"Engineered gene circuits offer an opportunity to harness biological systems for biotechnological and biomedical applications. However, reliance on native host promoters for the construction of circuit elements, such as logic gates, can make the implementation of predictable, independently functioning circuits difficult. In contrast, T7 promoters offer a simple orthogonal expression system for use in a variety of cellular backgrounds and even in cell-free systems. Here we develop a T7 promoter system that can be regulated by two different transcriptional repressors for the construction of a logic gate that functions in cells and in cell-free systems. We first present LacI repressible T7lacO promoters that are regulated from a distal lac operator site for repression. We next explore the positioning of a tet operator site within the T7lacO framework to create T7 promoters that respond to tet and lac repressors and realize an IMPLIES gate. Finally, we demonstrate that these dual input sensitive promoters function in an E. coli cell-free protein expression system. Our results expand the utility of T7 promoters in cell based as well as cell-free synthetic biology applications."

Toxic strains, however, are the main causative agents of non-bacterial seafood poisoning, a major concern for public health worldwide. Despite their importance, taxonomic uncertainty within many genera of dinoflagellates is still high. The genus Coolia includes potentially harmful species and the diversity within the genus is just starting to become apparent.In the current study, cultures were established from strains of Coolia spp. isolated from the central Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Cultures were identified based on thecal plate morphology and analyses of sequences (18S, ITS and 28S) from the nuclear rRNA operon. We report that the central GBR harbors a high diversity of Coolia species, including two species known to be capable of toxin production (C. tropicalis and C. malayensis), as well as the non-toxic C. canariensis. The strain of C. canariensis isolated from the GBR may in fact be a cryptic species, closely related but nevertheless phylogenetically distinct from the strain on which the holotype of C. canariensis was based. We also found evidence of the occurrence of a cryptic species morphologically very similar to both C. malayensis and C. monotis. The consequences of taxonomic confusion within the genus are discussed.The central GBR region harbors a previously unreported high diversity of Coolia spp., including two species known to potentially produce toxins. The presence of a cryptic species of unknown toxicity highlights the importance of cryptic diversity within dinoflagellates."

To address this, we built a new toolkit that enabled the high throughput tracking of individual cells enriched with polyglutamine-expanded Htt exon 1 (Httex1) monomers, oligomers, and inclusions using biosensors of aggregation state and flow cytometry pulse shape analysis. Supplemented with gel filtration chromatography and fluorescence-adapted sedimentation velocity analysis of cell lysates, we collated a multidimensional view of Httex1 aggregation in cells with respect to time, polyglutamine length, expression levels, cell survival, and overexpression of protein quality control chaperones hsp40 (DNAJB1) and hsp70 (HSPA1A). Cell death rates trended higher for Neuro2a cells containing Httex1 in inclusions than with Httex1 dispersed through the cytosol at time points of expression over 2 days. hsp40 stabilized monomers and suppressed inclusion formation but did not otherwise change Httex1 toxicity. hsp70, however, had no major effect on aggregation of Httex1 but increased the survival rate of cells with inclusions. hsp40 and hsp70 also increased levels of a second bicistronic reporter of Httex1 expression, mKate2, and increased total numbers of cells in culture, suggesting these chaperones partly rectify Httex1-induced deficiencies in quality control and growth rates. Collectively, these data suggest that Httex1 overstretches the protein quality control resources and that the defects can be partly rescued by overexpression of hsp40 and hsp70.

Protein misfolding and aggregation into β-sheet rich amyloid fibrils is a hallmark and possible cause of at least 36 human diseases (1Sipe J.D. Benson M.D. Buxbaum J.N. Ikeda S. Merlini G.

When aggregates form in a cell, however, they do so in an environment of omnifarious influence from protein quality control mechanisms (8Hartl F.U. Bracher A. Hayer-Hartl M. Molecular chaperones in protein folding and proteostasis.Nature. 2011; 475: 324-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (2189) Google Scholar). Protein quality control processes change the landscape by which proteins spontaneously aggregate by refolding misfolded conformations, disaggregating aggregates, degrading them, and sorting them into different cellular locations such as aggresomes, insoluble protein deposits, and Juxta nuclear quality control compartments for deposition and sequestration (9Johnston J.A.

The active movement of misfolded proteins into deposits such as aggresomes presents a paradox to the study of the effect of protein misfolding and aggregation in situ. On the one hand, organized aggregation by protein quality control machinery has net benefits to cell health, and on the other hand, spontaneous inappropriate aggregation is capricious (15Hatters D.M. Putting huntingtin “aggregation” in view with windows into the cellular milieu.Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2012; 12: 2611-2622Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). It remains plausible that both phenomena occur at the same time especially when protein quality control loses its capacity to control aggregation in an organized fashion (16Morimoto R.I. The heat shock response: Systems biology of proteotoxic stress in aging and disease.Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 2011; 76: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The contradictory nature of these processes and their relevance to disease necessitates more sophisticated approaches to decipher the molecular process of aggregation inside the cell and how this may impact cell health (15Hatters D.M.

The TC9 sensor is a derivative of Httex1 with an engineered tetracysteine (TC) tag embedded with the Httex1 sequence that is masked from binding to biarsenical fluorescent dyes upon self-assembly in vitro (17Ramdzan Y.M. Nisbet R.M. Miller J. Finkbeiner S. Hill A.F. Hatters D.M. Conformation sensors that distinguish monomeric proteins from oligomers in live cells.Chem.

Httex1TC9 is also tagged C-terminally with a fluorescent protein (e.g. cyan fluorescent protein derivative Cerulean) that independently reports the presence of the protein. Hence, two-color imaging enables readouts of the balance of monomers and aggregates inside live cells, independently to cellular localization (17Ramdzan Y.M. Nisbet R.M. Miller J. Finkbeiner S.

This technology was recently merged with a flow cytometry pulse shape analysis (PulSA) method, which utilizes fluorescent pulse width and height information from a flow cytometer to monitor changes in the intracellular distribution of protein (19Ramdzan Y.M. Polling S. Chia C.P. Ng I.H. Ormsby A.R. Croft N.P. Purcell A.W. Bogoyevitch M.A. Ng D.C. Gleeson P.A. Hatters D.M. Tracking protein aggregation and mislocalization in cells with flow cytometry.Nat. Methods. 2012; 9: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). PulSA in combination with the TC9 sensor system enabled a distinction in detection of biochemical aggregates, which can be as small in theory as a dimer (i.e. nanometer scale), from the condensation into microscopically visible structures (i.e. micrometer scale) such as inclusions, providing a new high throughput capacity to track cells enriched with dispersed oligomers of Httex1 from cells with monomers or the inclusions. A second toolkit was sedimentation velocity analysis (SVA) with analytical ultracentrifugation to quantitate the oligomeric size and heterogeneity of GFP-tagged Httex1 aggregate forms in a cell lysate (18Olshina M.A. Angley L.M. Ramdzan Y.M. Tang J. Bailey M.F. Hill A.F. Hatters D.M. Tracking mutant huntingtin aggregation kinetics in cells reveals three major populations that include an invariant oligomer pool.J. Biol.

For the aggregation prone 46Gln form of Httex1, this approach yielded a heterogeneous mixture of oligomers, most abundantly about 30 nm in diameter. The nonaggregation 25Gln isoform of Httex1 in contrast only yielded monomers. The combination of the single cell approaches with biochemical approaches (e.g. SVA) in principle provides an enabling platform to define the kinetic process of aggregation approaching a molecular scale of detail. Here, we describe an implementation of an integrated platform for defining Httex1 aggregation in the cell by merging our existing toolkits together and developing new capabilities to follow cell death and protein levels. We used this workflow to first monitor the impact of aggregation state on cell death, and second to examine how elevation of key inducible members of the heat shock protein family (hsp70 protein HSPA1A and its hsp40 cofactor DNAJB1) alters the Httex1 aggregation landscape and cell survival when levels are elevated. hsp70 and its co-chaperone hsp40 are key elements that have canonical functions in assisting proteins to fold correctly, and they potently inhibit toxicity of Httex1 in model systems (27Young J.C.

The nonfarnesylated mKate2 version of the IRES vector was created by excision of the farnesylation tag with BsiW1 digestion and vector religation. Hsp40 and Hsp70 chaperones were provided from Paul Muchowski (Gladstone Institutes) and verified by DNA sequencing. Neuro-2a cells were maintained in OptiMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified incubator with 5% atmospheric CO2. 2 × 105 cells were plated in individual wells of a 24-well tissue culture plate. The following day, the cells in each well were transfected with 2 μl of Lipofectamine 2000/0.8 μg of vector DNA according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The next day, the media were refreshed (500 μl), and for the time course the media were refreshed daily. Cell suspensions were kept on ice until analysis by flow cytometry.

For SYTOX staining, the media from the cultured cells were removed 24 h after transfection and kept aside in parallel format in 24-well plates and retained in the cell culture incubator. Fresh media were added to the cells, and at further time points of analysis, the media were collected and added to the initial media collections (so as to collect any detached cells). Remaining adherent cells were detached by gentle agitation and pipetting in 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The cell suspension was added to the set-aside media and then pelleted (1600 × g; 3 min; room temperature). The supernatant was discarded and the pellet resuspended in 500 μl of PBS followed by 0.5 μl of 5 μm SYTOX Red Dead stain (Invitrogen). Cell suspensions were kept on ice until analysis by flow cytometry (which was all completed within 1 h after labeling). Cells were analyzed at high flow rate in an LSRFortessa flow cytometer, equipped with 405- and 488-nm lasers (BD Biosciences). 50,000–100,000 events were collected, using a forward scatter threshold of 5,000. Data were collected in pulse height, area, and width parameters for each channel. For Cerulean fluorescence, data were collected with the 405-nm laser and Pacific blue filter. For FlAsH and GFP, data were collected with the 488-nm laser and FITC filter. mKate2 fluorescence was collected in the PE-Texas Red filter. SYTOX Red Dead stain was collected using 640-nm laser and the APC filter. All flow cytometry data were analyzed with FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences), FlowJo (Tree Star Inc.), or manually in Excel (Microsoft). 1 × 106 cells were plated in individual wells of a 6-well tissue culture plate. The following day, the cells in each well were transfected with 10 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 and 4 μg of vector DNA according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). After 24 h, the media were refreshed (2 ml). Cells were harvested at 48 h post-transfection by first rinsing in PBS, followed by resuspension in PBS with a cell scraper, and gentle pipetting. Cells were pelleted (1,600 × g; 3 min) and resuspended in 2 ml of 2% (v/v) paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were again pelleted (1,600 × g; 3 min), resuspended in 2 ml of PBS, and filtered through 100-μm nylon mesh before analysis and recovery on a BD FacsAria cell sorter (BD Biosciences). Cells were imaged on a Leica SP2 confocal microscope using a HC PL APO lbd.BL 20.0 × 0.70 IMM objective (TCS SP2 Leica). 6 × 106 cells were plated in 75-cm2 tissue culture flasks. The following day, cells were transfected with 24 μg of DNA and 60 μl of Lipofectamine 2000. 24 h after transfection, media were either refreshed for the 30-h time point, or cells were harvested by scraping. Cells were then pelleted (1,600 × g; 3 min; room temperature) and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Cells were then lysed as described previously (18Olshina M.A. Angley L.M. Ramdzan Y.M. Tang J.

https://openalex.org/W2043726881,"We previously described a novel suicide (or ‘cell fate control’) gene therapy enzyme/prodrug system based on an engineered variant of human thymidylate kinase (TMPK) that potentiates azidothymidine (AZT) activation. Delivery of a suicide gene sequence into tumors by lentiviral transduction embodies a cancer gene therapy that could employ bystander cell killing as a mechanism driving significant tumor regression in vivo. Here we present evidence of a significant bystander cell killing in vitro and in vivo mediated by the TMPK/AZT suicide gene axis that is reliant on the formation of functional gap-junctional intercellular communications (GJICs). Potentiation of AZT activation by the engineered TMPK expressed in the human prostate cancer cell line, PC-3, resulted in effective bystander killing of PC-3 cells lacking TMPK expression – an effect that could be blocked by the GJIC inhibitor, carbenoxolone. Although GJICs are mainly formed by connexins, a new family of GJIC molecules designated pannexins has been recently identified. PC-3 cells expressed both connexin43 (Cx43) and Pannexin1 (Panx1), but Panx1 expression predominated at the plasma membrane, whereas Cx43 expression was primarily localized to the cytosol. The contribution of bystander effects to the reduction of solid tumor xenografts established by the PC-3 cell line was evaluated in an animal model. We demonstrate the contribution of bystander cell killing to tumor regression in a xenograft model relying on the delivery of expression of the TMPK suicide gene into tumors via direct intratumoral injection of recombinant therapeutic lentivirus. Taken together, our data underscore that the TMPK/AZT enzyme-prodrug axis can be effectively utilized in suicide gene therapy of solid tumors, wherein significant tumor regression can be achieved via bystander effects mediated by GJICs."
https://openalex.org/W2072226297,"Background Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) play important roles in chronic intestinal inflammation. Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is the most common gastrointestinal emergency in preterm infants and is characterized by acute intestinal inflammation and necrosis. The objective of the study is to investigate the role of ER stress and the UPR in NEC patients. Methods Ileal tissues from NEC and control patients were obtained during surgical resection and/or at stoma closure. Splicing of XBP1 was detected using PCR, and gene expression was quantified using qPCR and Western blot. Results Splicing of XBP1 was only detected in a subset of acute NEC (A-NEC) patients, and not in NEC patients who had undergone reanastomosis (R-NEC). The other ER stress and the UPR pathways, PERK and ATF6, were not activated in NEC patients. A-NEC patients showing XBP1 splicing (A-NEC-XBP1s) had increased mucosal expression of GRP78, CHOP, IL6 and IL8. Similar results were obtained by inducing ER stress and the UPR in vitro. A-NEC-XBP1s patients showed altered T cell differentiation indicated by decreased mucosal expression of RORC, IL17A and FOXP3. A-NEC-XBP1s patients additionally showed more severe morphological damage and a worse surgical outcome. Compared with A-NEC patients, R-NEC patients showed lower mucosal IL6 and IL8 expression and higher mucosal FOXP3 expression. Conclusions XBP1 splicing, ER stress and the UPR in NEC are associated with increased IL6 and IL8 expression levels, altered T cell differentiation and severe epithelial injury."
https://openalex.org/W2120691387,"Bromodomain-containing protein 2 (Brd2) is a nuclear serine/threonine kinase involved in transcriptional regulation. In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, Brd2 normally co-represses PPARγ (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma) and inhibits adipogenesis. Here, we show that Brd2 over-expression in preadipocytes inhibits their differentiation into adipocytes, while Brd2 knockdown promotes adipogenic differentiation in vitro and forces cells to undergo adipogenesis independent of the MDI (methyisobutylxanthane, dexamethasone and insulin) induction. In this study, the two key transcription factors for adipogenesis, PPARγ and C/EBPα (CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-α) were persistently expressed during the differentiation of preadipocytes to mature adipocytes in Brd2 knockdown 3T3-L1 cells, but their expression was inhibited in cells in which Brd2 was overexpressed. To investigate the role of Brd2 in signal transduction we examined the expression of several signaling molecules involved in the regulation of gene expression and cell differentiation by immunoblotting assay. Down-regulation of Brd2 expression in 3T3-L1 cells led to a decrease in extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 (ERK1/2) activity and, conversely, the up-regulation of Brd2 leads to increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Nevertheless, changes in Brd2 expression do not affect the activities of JNK and p38 MAPK. In addition, the phosphorylation of Rafs is not affected by changes in Brd2 expression in 3T3-L1 cells. MEK inhibitor UO126 partly restores differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells that overexpress Brd2. In conclusion, these results indicate that Brd2 regulates ERK1/2 activity independently of Raf signaling in 3T3-L1 adipocytes."

Additionally, we show that this conformational change is lost upon mutating Asp-238, Glu-239, and Asp-260, which line the finger domains, to alanines.

The LRET experiments on D238A/E239A/D260A showed no changes in LRET efficiency upon reduction in pH from 8 to 6. The LRET and electrophysiological studies thus suggest that the three carboxylates, two of which are involved in carboxyl/carboxylate interactions, are essential for proton-induced conformational changes in the extracellular domain, which in turn are necessary for receptor activation.

https://openalex.org/W2145975945,"The concept of focal epilepsies includes a seizure origin in brain regions with hyper synchronous activity (epileptogenic zone and seizure onset zone) and a complex epileptic network of different brain areas involved in the generation, propagation, and modulation of seizures. The purpose of this work was to study functional and effective connectivity between regions involved in networks of epileptic seizures. The beginning and middle part of focal seizures from ictal surface EEG data were analyzed using dynamic imaging of coherent sources (DICS), an inverse solution in the frequency domain which describes neuronal networks and coherences of oscillatory brain activities. The information flow (effective connectivity) between coherent sources was investigated using the renormalized partial directed coherence (RPDC) method. In 8/11 patients, the first and second source of epileptic activity as found by DICS were concordant with the operative resection site; these patients became seizure free after epilepsy surgery. In the remaining 3 patients, the results of DICS / RPDC calculations and the resection site were discordant; these patients had a poorer post-operative outcome. The first sources as found by DICS were located predominantly in cortical structures; subsequent sources included some subcortical structures: thalamus, Nucl. Subthalamicus and cerebellum. DICS seems to be a powerful tool to define the seizure onset zone and the epileptic networks involved. Seizure generation seems to be related to the propagation of epileptic activity from the primary source in the seizure onset zone, and maintenance of seizures is attributed to the perpetuation of epileptic activity between nodes in the epileptic network. Despite of these promising results, this proof of principle study needs further confirmation prior to the use of the described methods in the clinical praxis."
https://openalex.org/W1981331850,"The normal intrauterine fluid environment is essential for embryo implantation. In hydrosalpinx patients, the implantation and pregnancy rates are markedly decreased after IVF–embryo transfer, while salpingectomy could significantly improve the pregnancy rates. The leakage of hydrosalpinx fluid into the endometrial cavity was supposed to be the major cause for impaired fertility. However, the underlying mechanisms of hydrosalpinx fluids on implantation and ongoing pregnancy were not fully understood and remain controversial regarding its toxicity. In present study, by infusing different volume of non-toxic fluid (0.9% saline) into uterine lumen before embryo implantation in mice (Day4 08:30), we found that while the embryos were not “flushed out” from the uteri, the timing of implantation was deferred and normal intrauterine distribution (embryo spacing) was disrupted. The abnormal implantation at early pregnancy further lead to embryo growth retardation, miscarriage and increased pregnancy loss, which is similar to the adverse effects observed in hydrosalpinx patients undergoing IVF-ET. We further examined uterine receptivity related gene expression reported to be involved in human hydrosalpinx (Lif, Hoxa10, Integrin α(v) and β(3)). The results showed that expression of integrin α(v) and β(3) were increased in the fluid infused mouse uteri, implicating a compensatory effect to cope with the excessive fluid environment. Our data suggested that the adverse effects of excessive non-toxic luminal fluid on pregnancy are primarily due to the mechanical interference for normal timing and location of embryo apposition, which might be the major cause of decreased implantation rate in IVF-ET patients with hydrosalpinx."
https://openalex.org/W2074194695,"Background Nucleic acid-based methods offer promise for both targeted and exploratory investigations of microbes in tissue samples. As the starting material for such studies is a mixture of host and microbial DNA, we have critically evaluated the DNA extraction step to determine the quantitative and qualitative parameters that permit faithful molecular detection of mycobacteria in infected tissue. Specifically, we assessed: 1) tissue disruption procedures; 2) DNA extraction protocols; and 3) inhibition of bacterial PCR by host DNA. Principal Findings Regarding DNA extraction, we found that 1) grinding was not necessary if bead-beating is done, 2) the reference mycobacterial DNA extraction method recovered more pure DNA than commercial spin column kits, 3) lysozyme digestion of 1 hour was sufficient, and 4) repeated steps of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol offered minimal gain in DNA quality. By artificially mixing mycobacterial DNA with DNA extracted from uninfected mice, we found that bacterial real-time quantitative PCR was only reliable when the quantity of host DNA was < 3 µg in a final volume of 25 µl and the quality was high (260/280 nm ratio = 1.89±0.08). Findings from spiked DNA studies were confirmed using DNA extracted from mice infected with different intracellular pathogens (M. tuberculosis, M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis). Conclusions Our findings point to the most appropriate methods for extracting DNA from tissue samples for the purpose of detecting and quantifying mycobacteria. These data also inform on the limits of detection for two mycobacterial species and indicate that increasing the sample mass to improve analytic sensitivity comes at the cost of inhibition of PCR by host DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2048858964,"The RNA polymerase II (RNApII) C-terminal domain (CTD)-interacting domain (CID) proteins are involved in two distinct RNApII termination pathways and recognize different phosphorylated forms of CTD. To investigate the role of differential CTD-CID interactions in the choice of termination pathway, we altered the CTD-binding specificity of Nrd1 by domain swapping. Nrd1 with the CID from Rtt103 (Nrd1(CID(Rtt103))) causes read-through transcription at many genes, but can also trigger termination where multiple Nrd1/Nab3-binding sites and the Ser(P)-2 CTD co-exist. Therefore, CTD-CID interactions target specific termination complexes to help choose an RNApII termination pathway. Interactions of Nrd1 with both CTD and nascent transcripts contribute to efficient termination by the Nrd1 complex. Surprisingly, replacing the Nrd1 CID with that from Rtt103 reduces binding to Rrp6/Trf4, and RNA transcripts terminated by Nrd1(CID(Rtt103)) are predominantly processed by core exosome. Thus, the Nrd1 CID couples Ser(P)-5 CTD not only to termination, but also to RNA processing by the nuclear exosome."
https://openalex.org/W2042763416,"Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most common malignant renal epithelial tumor and also the most deadly. To identify molecular changes occurring in ccRCC, in the present study we performed a genome wide analysis of its entire complement of mRNAs. Gene and exon-level analyses were carried out by means of the Affymetrix Exon Array platform. To achieve a reliable detection of differentially expressed cassette exons we implemented a novel methodology that considered contiguous combinations of exon triplets and candidate differentially expressed cassette exons were identified when the expression level was significantly different only in the central exon of the triplet. More detailed analyses were performed for selected genes using quantitative RT-PCR and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Our analysis detected over 2,000 differentially expressed genes, and about 250 genes alternatively spliced and showed differential inclusion of specific cassette exons comparing tumor and non-tumoral tissues. We demonstrated the presence in ccRCC of an altered expression of the PTP4A3, LAMA4, KCNJ1 and TCF21 genes (at both transcript and protein level). Furthermore, we confirmed, at the mRNA level, the involvement of CAV2 and SFRP genes that have previously been identified. At exon level, among potential candidates we validated a differentially included cassette exon in DAB2 gene with a significant increase of DAB2 p96 splice variant as compared to the p67 isoform. Based on the results obtained, and their robustness according to both statistical analysis and literature surveys, we believe that a combination of gene/isoform expression signature may remarkably contribute, after suitable validation, to a more effective and reliable definition of molecular biomarkers for ccRCC early diagnosis, prognosis and prediction of therapeutic response."
https://openalex.org/W2032623282,"Occurrence of DNA damage in a cell activates the DNA damage response, a survival mechanism that ensures genomics stability. Two key members of the DNA damage response are the tumor suppressor p53, which is the most frequently mutated gene in cancers, and MDC1, which is a central adaptor that recruits many proteins to sites of DNA damage. Here we characterize the in vitro interaction between p53 and MDC1 and demonstrate that p53 and MDC1 directly interact. The p53-MDC1 interaction is mediated by the tandem BRCT domain of MDC1 and the C-terminal domain of p53. We further show that both acetylation of lysine 382 and phosphorylation of serine 392 in p53 enhance the interaction between p53 and MDC1. Additionally, we demonstrate that the p53-MDC1 interaction is augmented upon the induction of DNA damage in human cells. Our data suggests a new role for acetylation of lysine 382 and phosphorylation of serine 392 in p53 in the cellular stress response and offers the first evidence for an interaction involving MDC1 that is modulated by acetylation."
https://openalex.org/W2144222868,"How medical students handle negative emotions expressed by simulated patients during Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCE) has not been fully investigated. We aim to explore (i) whether medical students respond differently to different types of patients' emotional cues; and (2) possible effects of patients' progressive disclosure of emotional cues on students' responses.Forty OSCE consultations were video recorded and coded for patients' expressions of emotional distress and students' responses using a validated behavioural coding scheme (the Verona Coding Definitions of Emotional Sequence). Logistic multilevel regression was adopted to model the probability of the occurrence of student reduce space response behaviour as a function of the number of patients' expressions of emotional cues.We found that medical students offered responses that differed to emotional cue types expressed by simulated patients. Students appeared to provide space to emotional cues when expressed in vague and unspecific words and reduce space to cues emphasizing physiological or cognitive correlates. We also found that medical students were less likely to explore patients' emotional distress nearer the end of the consultation and when the duration of a patient speech turn got larger. Cumulative frequency of patients' emotional cues also predicted students' reduce space behaviour.Understanding how medical students manage negative emotions has significant implications for training programme development focusing on emotion recognition skills and patient-centred communication approach. In addition, the statistical approaches adopted by this study will encourage researchers in healthcare communication to search for appropriate analytical techniques to test theoretical propositions."

For these studies, we tagged the TAP1 and TAP2 subunits with enhanced cyan fluorescent protein and enhanced yellow fluorescent protein, respectively, C-terminally to their nucleotide binding domains (NBDs), and measured FRET efficiencies under different conditions. Our data indicate that both ATP and ADP enhance the FRET efficiencies but that neither induces a maximally closed NBD conformation.

Maximal NBD closure is induced by the combination of peptide and non-hydrolysable ATP analogs. Thus, TAP1-TAP2 NBD dimers are not fully stabilized by nucleotides alone, and substrate binding plays a key role in inducing the transition state conformations of the NBD.

TAP belongs to ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily, which is a group of membrane proteins that use the binding and hydrolysis of ATP to power the translocation of a wide variety of substrates across cellular membranes (4Higgins C.F. ABC transporters. Physiology, structure and mechanism. An overview.Res. Microbiol. 2001; 152: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). These proteins share a common architecture, comprising two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) that bind and hydrolyze ATP and two transmembrane domains (TMDs) that contain the substrate binding sites and form the transport pathway (5Rees D.C. Johnson E. Lewinson O. ABC transporters. The power to change.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 218-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). Two major models have been suggested for the ATP hydrolysis mechanism of ABC transporters (6George A.M. Jones P.M. Perspectives on the structure-function of ABC transporters. The Switch and Constant Contact models.Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2012; 109: 95-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In the “switch” model, NBD dimerization following ATP binding provides the “power stroke” driving substrate transport, whereas ATP hydrolysis is required to reset the transporter. In the “constant contact” model, the NBD monomers never fully separate, and ATP hydrolysis occurs alternately at each of the two active sites. As in other ABC transporters, the TAP1-TAP2 complex comprises two nucleotide-binding domains, located on the cytosolic side of the ER membrane (Fig. 1). Two composite ATP-binding active sites are formed by the interaction of the signature motif on each NBD with an ATP molecule bound to the Walker A and B motifs of an opposing NBD (7Gaudet R.

Biochemical studies showed that purified TAP1-TAP2 NBDs are unable to form a heterodimer in solution in the presence of either ADP or ATP (8Procko E. Ferrin-O'Connell I. Ng S.L. Gaudet R.

However, interactions between the NBD of full-length TAP1-TAP2 complexes have not been investigated previously. Although the crystal structures of isolated TAP1 nucleotide-binding domains have been solved (7Gaudet R. Wiley D.C.

Cell. 2006; 24: 51-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), high-resolution structural data for full-length TAP are currently lacking. According to the current mechanistic model for ABC transporter function (reviewed in Refs 5Rees D.C. Johnson E. Lewinson O. ABC transporters. The power to change.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 218-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar, 6George A.M. Jones P.M. Perspectives on the structure-function of ABC transporters. The Switch and Constant Contact models.Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2012; 109: 95-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), TAP can exist in at least two major conformations during the catalytic cycle: an “inward”-facing conformation, with the peptide binding pocket exposed to the cytoplasmic side and separated NBDs (Fig. 1A), and an “outward”-facing conformation with a low-affinity peptide binding site exposed to the ER and closely interacting NBDs (Fig. 1B). The C termini of the two NBDs are predicted to undergo large distance changes when going from an inward-facing conformation to an outward-facing conformation (9Corradi V. Singh G. Tieleman D.P. The human transporter associated with antigen processing. Molecular models to describe peptide binding competent states.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 28099-28111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In this report, we investigated the movement of TAP NBDs during the catalytic cycle using a FRET approach, which allows us to monitor the distance changes between the TAP1-TAP2 NBDs in a native cellular membrane environment under different conditions without the need of biochemical sample preparation. A baculovirus encoding the enhanced cyan fluorescent protein-tagged version of human TAP1 (TAP1-ECFP) was obtained as described previously (10Lapinski P.E. Raghuraman G. Raghavan M.

Catalytic site modifications of TAP1 and TAP2 and their functional consequences.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39839-39851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). For construction of the enhanced yellow fluorescent protein-tagged version of human TAP2 (TAP2-EYFP), the TAP2 was excised from pPCRscript (11Perria C.L. Rajamanickam V. Lapinski P.E. Raghavan M. Catalytic site modifications of TAP1 and TAP2 and their functional consequences.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39839-39851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) with BglII and ligated into pEYFP (Clontech) at the BamHI site to generate the TAP2 fusion with EYFP. TAP2-EYFP was then excised from pEYFP with XbaI, ligated into the vector pVL1393 (BD Pharmingen) at the XbaI site, and used to generate a TAP2-EYFP-encoding baculovirus using the BaculoGold transfection kit (BD Pharmingen). The hydrolysis-deficient TAP2 mutant TAP2-EYFP(E632Q) was made by introducing the E632Q mutation into TAP2-EYFP using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit. The primers were 5′-GGGTCCTCATTCTAGATCAGGCTACTAGTGCCCTAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTAGGGCACTAGTAGCCTGATCTAGAATGAGGACCC-3′ (reverse) (11Perria C.L. Rajamanickam V. Lapinski P.E. Raghavan M. Catalytic site modifications of TAP1 and TAP2 and their functional consequences.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39839-39851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). All primers were purchased from Invitrogen. Sf9 cells were cultured in Sf-900TM II serum free media (SFM) (Invitrogen). The cells were grown to confluence and infected with the appropriate baculoviruses at multiplicities of infection of 5–20, depending on the protein expression level of individual baculoviruses. Following these infections, the cells were harvested after 72 h, and microsomal membranes were generated as described (12Lapinski P.E. Neubig R.R. Raghavan M. Walker A lysine mutations of TAP1 and TAP2 interfere with peptide translocation but not peptide binding.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7526-7533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Peptide transport was analyzed using the fluorescent peptide RYWANATKFITCSR as described previously (13Neumann L. Tampé R. Kinetic analysis of peptide binding to the TAP transport complex. Evidence for structural rearrangements induced by substrate binding.J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1203-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The translocation assay was performed by incubating microsomes with 10 μm of FITC-labeled peptide at 37 °C for 15 min in the presence of 5 mm ATP. Microsomes were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40. The fraction of transported and glycosylated peptide was recovered by overnight incubation with ConA-Sepharose (Pharmacia, Freiburg, Germany) and quantified by plate reader. Data were plotted as the mean ± S.E. of triplicate measurements. To measure TAP-dependent transport in whole cells, insect cells (2 × 106) were semipermeabilized with 0.05% saponin for 10 min on ice (14Herget M. Oancea G. Schrodt S. Karas M. Tampé R. Abele R. Mechanism of substrate sensing and signal transmission within an ABC transporter. Use of a Trojan horse strategy.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 3871-3880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). After washing, the cells were resuspended in a final volume of 200 μl of buffer A (20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2 (pH 7.4)) containing 10 mm ATP. The transport reaction was initiated by adding 1 μm fluorescent peptide (RYWANATKFITCSR) for 15 min at 37 °C. Transported peptides were isolated using ConA beads and quantified as described above. Sf9 cells were infected with recombinant baculoviruses, harvested by scraping 40–60 h post-infection, and washed once with cold buffer A. Sf9 cells were semipermeabilized with 0.05% saponin on ice for 10 min in buffer A (14Herget M. Oancea G. Schrodt S. Karas M. Tampé R. Abele R. Mechanism of substrate sensing and signal transmission within an ABC transporter. Use of a Trojan horse strategy.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 3871-3880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Cells were resuspended at a fixed density (1 × 106 cells/ml) for all measurements. FRET spectra were generated by exciting cells at 430 nm (bandpass, 8 nm) and scanning from 450–600 nm (bandpass, 4 nm) on a FluoroMax-4 fluorometer (Horiba Scientific). The apparent FRET efficiency was measured by calculating the ratio of emission of EYFP (527 nm) to ECFP (475 nm) (15Malik R.U. Ritt M. DeVree B.T. Neubig R.R. Sunahara R.K. Sivaramakrishnan S. Detection of G-protein selective G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) conformations in live cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 17167-17178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and FRET efficiency changes are shown as (A/D (sample) − A/D (control)) / A/D (control). Results are expressed as mean values ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments, with each experiment analyzed in triplicate. Statistical analysis was carried out using GraphPad Prism 5.0 (Graphad Software Inc.) Statistical significances evaluated using paired Student's t tests are indicated in the figure legends with corresponding p values of *, p ≤ 0.05; **, p ≤ 0.01; ***, p ≤ 0.001; and ****, p ≤ 0.0001. To calculate the dissociation constant KD for the peptides, the FRET efficiency change B was plotted against the peptide concentration [P]. Data were fitted using Equation 1, B=Bmax[P]/(KD+[P]),(Eq. 1) and KD values were determined by nonlinear least squares analysis. Permeabilized cells were incubated in buffer A containing 1 μm peptide RKL, 100 μm ATP, and 100 μm vanadate for 10 min at 27 °C. Vanadate was prepared as follows. Sodium orthovanadate was dissolved in water, and the pH of the solution was adjusted to 10 using HCl. The solution had a dark orange color and was boiled for 2 min until it turned colorless. Then it was cooled to room temperature. The process of adjusting the pH, boiling, and cooling was repeated two more times. The solution was stored frozen at −80 °C until use. To perform FRET assays, the fluorescent proteins ECFP and EYFP were fused to the C-terminal ends of TAP1 (T1C) and TAP2 (T2Y) and used as donor and acceptor, respectively (Fig. 1). Recombinant baculoviruses encoding T1C and T2Y were obtained as described under “Experimental Procedures” (10Lapinski P.E. Raghuraman G. Raghavan M.

Chem. 2003; 278: 8229-8237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 11Perria C.L. Rajamanickam V. Lapinski P.E. Raghavan M. Catalytic site modifications of TAP1 and TAP2 and their functional consequences.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39839-39851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and used to coinfect sf9 insect cells. To characterize the optical properties of ECFP and EYFP when attached to TAP1 and TAP2, the fluorescence of cells expressing T1C, T2Y, or T1C/T2Y were detected using a fluorometer, which showed that the fusion of ECFP or EYFP to TAP1 or TAP2 did not alter the spectral properties of the fluorescent proteins (Fig. 2A). When excited at 430 nm or 490 nm, T1C and T2Y displayed typical spectra for ECFP and EYFP, respectively, with emission peaks at 475 and 527 nm. Cells expressing both T1C and T2Y showed a significant FRET signal at 527 nm following excitation at 430 nm, indicating the formation of TAP1-TAP2 heterodimers (Fig. 1A). To ensure that attachment of fluorescent proteins to the TAP subunits did not interfere with the formation of a functional heterodimeric complex, peptide translocation experiments were next performed. A fluorophore-labeled TAP substrate (RYWANATKFITCSR) was incubated with control cells, cells expressing wild-type TAP complexes, T1C-T2Y, or an ATPase-deficient mutant complex, T1C-T2Y(E632Q) (11Perria C.L.

The glutamate-to-glutamine mutation at the residue C-terminal to the Walker B motif, as in TAP2(E632Q), impairs ATP hydrolysis and NBD dimer separation in many ABC transporters (8Procko E. Ferrin-O'Connell I. Ng S.L. Gaudet R. Distinct structural and functional properties of the ATPase sites in an asymmetric ABC transporter.Mol.

Transport of the peptide in whole cells was assessed in the presence or absence of ATP using previously described transport assays (14Herget M. Oancea G. Schrodt S. Karas M. Tampé R. Abele R. Mechanism of substrate sensing and signal transmission within an ABC transporter. Use of a Trojan horse strategy.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 3871-3880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Cells lacking TAP were used as the negative control. Similar to untagged wild-type TAP complexes, peptide fluorescence intensities from cells expressing T1C-T2Y were about 4-fold higher in the presence of ATP (+ATP) compared with the corresponding signals observed in the absence of ATP (-ATP) (Fig. 2B), indicating that the T1C-T2Y complex is competent for translocation and, thus, folded and assembled similarly to the wild-type TAP complex. The ATPase-deficient mutant complex T1C/T2Y(E632Q) did not transport peptides, as expected from previous measurements with untagged mutant complexes (11Perria C.L. Rajamanickam V. Lapinski P.E.

Chem. 2006; 281: 39839-39851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). Thus, the attachment of ECFP or EYFP at the C terminus does not affect the function of TAP, which allowed us to use the tagged TAP1-TAP2 complexes to study NBD interactions in permeabilized cells. Nucleotides are important cofactors that regulate the conformation of ABC transporters. The crystal structures of NBDs of ABC proteins and biochemical studies support the concept of an ATP binding-driven dimerization and ATP hydrolysis-promoted separation of NBDs (18Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Detty M.R. Clarke D.M. The ATPase activity of the P-glycoprotein drug pump is highly activated when the N-terminal and central regions of the nucleotide-binding domains are linked closely together.J. Biol.

Alternating access with a twist.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 19005-19010Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). Purified TAP1-TAP2 NBDs are unable to form a heterodimer in solution in the presence of either ADP or ATP (8Procko E. Ferrin-O'Connell I. Ng S.L. Gaudet R. Distinct structural and functional properties of the ATPase sites in an asymmetric ABC transporter.Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 51-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). We investigated the effect of nucleotides on NBD interaction in the context of full-length TAP1 and TAP2 by using fluorescent protein-based FRET spectroscopy. Comparing the acceptor to donor (A/D) ratio between spectra is an established method of estimating relative distance changes between two fluorophores (20Miyawaki A. Tsien R.Y. Monitoring protein conformations and interactions by fluorescence resonance energy transfer between mutants of green fluorescent protein.Methods Enzymol. 2000; 327: 472-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar), and applications of this method to examine averaged conformational changes in intact cells have been described recently (for example, in Ref. 15Malik R.U. Ritt M. DeVree B.T. Neubig R.R. Sunahara R.K. Sivaramakrishnan S. Detection of G-protein selective G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) conformations in live cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 17167-17178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). An increase in the A/D ratio indicates an increase in FRET efficiency and a decrease of distance between the donor and acceptor molecules. A decrease in the A/D ratio, on the other hand, would indicate an increase in the distance. To exclude the influence of endogenous ATP, we incubated the cells with saponin to permeabilize the cells, and intracellular ATP was rinsed out with buffer lacking ATP (21Willemse M. Janssen E. de Lange F. Wieringa B. Fransen J. ATP and FRET. A cautionary note.Nat. Biotechnol. 2007; 25: 170-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Fig. 3, A and B, shows FRET efficiency changes, normalized to the apo state, obtained for the wild-type T1C-T2Y complex in the presence of ADP, ATP, and a non-hydrolysable ATP analog, AMP-PNP (adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imido)triphosphate). Previously, it had been shown that AMP-PNP can bind ABC transporters and induce a “closed” NBD conformation (19Ward A. Reyes C.L. Yu J. Roth C.B. Chang G. Flexibility in the ABC transporter MsbA. Alternating access with a twist.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 19005-19010Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar, 22Dawson R.J. Locher K.P.

Snapshots of the maltose transporter during ATP hydrolysis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 15152-15156Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). At 4 °C, neither ADP, ATP, nor AMP-PNP induced a significant FRET efficiency enhancement (Fig. 3A). However, at 27 °C, all three nucleotides enhanced FRET efficiency (Fig. 3B). ADP has been shown to be less effective than ATP in inducing NBD dimerization of other ABC transporters (24Lu G. Westbrooks J.M. Davidson A.L. Chen J. ATP hydrolysis is required to reset the ATP-binding cassette dimer into the resting-state conformation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 17969-17974Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 25Zaitseva J. Oswald C. Jumpertz T. Jenewein S. Wiedenmann A. Holland I.B. Schmitt L. A structural analysis of asymmetry required for catalytic activity of an ABC-ATPase domain dimer.EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3432-3443Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). However, in the case of full-length TAP complexes in native cell membranes, there was no consistent difference between the FRET signals induced by ATP and ADP or even the non-hydrolysable AMP-PNP. Stable nucleotide-bound dimers of ABC transporter NBDs have been obtained previously by preventing ATP hydrolysis by mutagenesis (16Smith P.C. Karpowich N. Millen L. Moody J.E. Rosen J. Thomas P.J. Hunt J.F. ATP binding to the motor domain from an ABC transporter drives formation of a nucleotide sandwich dimer.Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 139-149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig. 3, C and D, with the ATPase-deficient TAP mutant complex T1C/T2Y(E632Q), the addition of ATP, but not ADP, markedly increased the FRET signal even at 4 °C (Fig. 3C). At 27 °C, both ADP and ATP enhanced FRET efficiency significantly, but the effect of ATP is stronger than that of ADP (Fig. 3D). Thus, the mutant complex is more sensitive to the effect of ATP compared with the wild-type TAP counterpart. Additionally, nucleotides have different effects on TAP NBD closure in the context of the ATPase-deficient TAP mutant complex compared with the wild-type complex. To test the effects of peptides on NBD interactions, we chose two peptides substrates, RRYQKSTEL (RKL) and RRYNASTEL (RAL), with a high and intermediate affinity for TAP, respectively (26Gorbulev S. Abele R. Tampé R. Allosteric crosstalk between peptide-binding, transport, and ATP hydrolysis of the ABC transporter TAP.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 3732-3737Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Additionally, because peptide acetylation at the N terminus is expected to impair binding to TAP (27Momburg F. Roelse J. Howard J.C. Butcher G.W. Hämmerling G.J. Neefjes J.J. Selectivity of MHC-encoded peptide transporters from human, mouse and rat.Nature. 1994; 367: 648-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 28Schumacher T.N. Kantesaria D.V. Heemels M.T. Ashton-Rickardt P.G. Shepherd J.C. Fruh K. Yang Y. Peterson P.A. Tonegawa S. Ploegh H.L. Peptide length and sequence specificity of the mouse TAP1/TAP2 translocator.J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 533-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), the acetylated peptide GILGCVFTL (Acetyl-GL) was used as a control. As shown in Fig. 4, A and B, addition to the T1C-T2Y complex of the TAP-specific peptides RKL and RAL, but not the control peptide Acetyl-GL, leads to a significant increase in FRET efficiency, suggesting that the binding of substrate peptide alone can induce a conformational change in the NBDs, which enhances NBD proximity. To exclude the influence of residual endogenous ATP, we used apyrase-treated microsomes prepared from T1C- and T2Y-infected insect cells in buffers lacking nucleotides. Similar to the cell-based FRET study (Fig. 4B), peptide binding altered the distances between the two NBDs, even under the ATP-depleted microsome condition (Fig. 4C), confirming that peptide binding alone in the absence of bound nucleotides can induce conformational changes of the NBD. We next analyzed the FRET efficiency as a function of peptide concentration (Fig. 4D). There was a dependence of FRET efficiency on the peptide concentration for both the high- and intermediate-affinity peptides, but not for the control peptide, which did not enhance the FRET signal, even at a high concentration. The KD values calculated on the basis of the FRET efficiency changes are 68.92 ± 17.42 nm and 239.1 ± 156.2 nm for RKL and RAL, respectively. These values correlate directly with the peptide binding affinity constants reported by saturation binding assays (154 ± 9 and 503 ± 54 nm, respectively), and the half-maximal concentrations for ATPase stimulation for these two substrates (161 ± 15 and 574 ± 134 nm, respectively) (26Gorbulev S. Abele R. Tampé R. Allosteric crosstalk between peptide-binding, transport, and ATP hydrolysis of the ABC transporter TAP.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 3732-3737Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that similar maximal FRET enhancements were achieved with both peptides. Thus, the saturation of all substrate-binding pockets leads to a similar NBD closure. From this correlation between peptide-induced NBD conformational changes,"
https://openalex.org/W2159532426,"The T lymphocytes are the most important effector cells in immunotherapy of cancer. The conceptual objective for developing the tumor targeted superantigen (TTS) ABR-217620 (naptumomab estafenatox, 5T4Fab-SEA/E-120), now in phase 3 studies for advanced renal cell cancer, was to selectively coat tumor cells with cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) target structures functionally similar to natural CTL pMHC target molecules. Here we present data showing that the molecular basis for the anti-tumor activity by ABR-217620 resides in the distinct interaction between the T cell receptor β variable (TRBV) 7-9 and the engineered superantigen (Sag) SEA/E-120 in the fusion protein bound to the 5T4 antigen on tumor cells. Multimeric but not monomeric ABR-217620 selectively stains TRBV7-9 expressing T lymphocytes from human peripheral blood similar to antigen specific staining of T cells with pMHC tetramers. SEA/E-120 selectively activates TRBV7-9 expressing T lymphocytes resulting in expansion of the subset. ABR-217620 selectively triggers TRBV7-9 expressing cytotoxic T lymphocytes to kill 5T4 positive tumor cells. Furthermore, ABR-217620 activates TRBV7-9 expressing T cell line cells in the presence of cell- and bead-bound 5T4 tumor antigen. Surface plasmon resonance analysis revealed that ABR-217620 binds to 5T4 with high affinity, to TRBV7-9 with low affinity and to MHC class II with very low affinity. The T lymphocyte engagement by ABR-217620 is constituted by displaying high affinity binding to the tumor cells (KD approximately 1 nM) and with the mimicry of natural productive immune TCR-pMHC contact using affinities of around 1 µM. This difference in kinetics between the two components of the ABR-217620 fusion protein will bias the binding towards the 5T4 target antigen, efficiently activating T-cells via SEA/E-120 only when presented by the tumor cells."
https://openalex.org/W2044481697,"We compared the consequences of an ABCA1 mutation that produced an apparent lack of atherosclerosis (Tangier family 1, N935S) with an ABCA1 mutation with functional ABCA1 knockout that was associated with severe atherosclerosis (Tangier family 2, Leu(548):Leu(575)-End), using primary and telomerase-immortalized fibroblasts. Telomerase-immortalized Tangier fibroblasts of family 1 (TT1) showed 30% residual cholesterol efflux capacity in response to apolipoprotein A-I, whereas telomerase-immortalized Tangier fibroblasts of family 2 (TT2) showed only 20%. However, there were a number of secondary differences that were often stronger and may help to explain the more rapid development of atherosclerosis in family 2. First, the total cellular cholesterol content increase was 2-3-fold and 3-5-fold in TT1 and TT2 cells, respectively. The corresponding increase in esterified cholesterol concentration was 10- and 40-fold, respectively. Second, 24-, 25-, and 27-hydroxycholesterol concentrations were moderately increased in TT1 cells, but were increased as much as 200-fold in TT2 cells. Third, cholesterol biosynthesis was moderately decreased in TT1 cells, but was markedly decreased in TT2 cells. Fourth, potentially atheroprotective LXR-dependent SREBP1c signaling was normal in TT1, but was rather suppressed in TT2 cells. Cultivated primary Tangier fibroblasts were characterized by premature aging in culture and were associated with less obvious biochemical differences. In summary, these results may help to understand the differential atherosclerotic susceptibility in Tangier disease and further demonstrate the usefulness of telomerase-immortalized cells in studying this cellular phenotype. The data support the contention that side chain-oxidized oxysterols are strong suppressors of cholesterol biosynthesis under specific pathological conditions in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2061358188,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is characterized by progressive hypogammaglobulinemia predisposing affected patients to a variety of infectious diseases but paradoxically not to cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease. Moreover, we found reactivity of a panel of CLL recombinant antibodies (CLL-rAbs) encoded by a germ-line allele with a single CMV protein, pUL32, despite differing antibody binding motifs. To put these findings into perspective, we studied prospectively relative frequency of viremia, kinetics of total and virus-specific IgG over time, and UL32 genetic variation in a cohort of therapy-naive patients (n=200). CMV-DNA was detected in 3% (6/200) of patients. The decay of total IgG was uniform (mean, 0.03; SD, 0.03) and correlated with that of IgG subclasses 1-4 in the paired samples available (n=64; p<0.001). Total CMV-specific IgG kinetics were more variable (mean, 0,02; SD, 0,06) and mean decay values differed significantly from those of total IgG (p=0.034). Boosts of CMV-specific antibody levels were observed in 49% (22/45) of CMV-seropositive patients. In contrast, VZV- and EBV-specific IgG levels decayed in parallel with total IgG levels (p=0.003 and p=0.001, respectively). VZV-specific IgG even became undetectable in 18% (9/50) of patients whereas CMV-specific ones remained detectable in all seropositive patients. The observed CMV-specific IgG kinetics were predicated upon the highly divergent kinetics of IgG specific for individual antigens - glycoprotein B-specific IgG were boosted in 51% and pUL32-specific IgG in 32% of patients. In conclusion, CLL patients have a preserved CMV-specific antibody response despite progressive decay of total IgG and IgG subclasses. CMV-specific IgG levels are frequently boosted in contrast to that of other herpesviruses indicative of a higher rate of CMV reactivation and antigen-presentation. In contrast to the reactivity of multiple different CLL-rAbs with pUL32, boosts of humoral immunity are triggered apparently by other CMV antigens than pUL32, like glycoprotein B."
https://openalex.org/W2057045354,"The effect of the treatment with glycolipid derivatives on the metabolic profile of intact glioma cells and tumor tissues, investigated using proton high resolution magic angle spinning ((1)H HR-MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, is reported here. Two compounds were used, a glycoside and its thioglycoside analogue, both showing anti-proliferative activity on glioma C6 cell cultures; however, only the thioglycoside exhibited antitumor activity in vivo. At the drug concentrations showing anti-proliferative activity in cell culture (20 and 40 µM), significant increases in choline containing metabolites were observed in the (1)H NMR spectra of the same intact cells. In vivo experiments in nude mice bearing tumors derived from implanted C6 glioma cells, showed that reduction of tumor volume was associated with significant changes in the metabolic profile of the same intact tumor tissues; and were similar to those observed in cell culture. Specifically, the activity of the compounds is mainly associated with an increase in choline and phosphocholine, in both the cell cultures and tumoral tissues. Taurine, a metabolite that has been considered a biomarker of apoptosis, correlated with the reduction of tumor volume. Thus, the results indicate that the mode of action of the glycoside involves, at least in part, alteration of phospholipid metabolism, resulting in cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2086532230,"Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) is an important, generally non-invasive, bacterial pathogen that causes diarrhea in humans. The microbe infects mainly the enterocytes of the small intestine. Here we have applied our newly developed infrared surface plasmon resonance (IR-SPR) spectroscopy approach to study how EPEC infection affects epithelial host cells. The IR-SPR experiments showed that EPEC infection results in a robust reduction in the refractive index of the infected cells. Assisted by confocal and total internal reflection microscopy, we discovered that the microbe dilates the intercellular gaps and induces the appearance of fluid-phase-filled pinocytic vesicles in the lower basolateral regions of the host epithelial cells. Partial cell detachment from the underlying substratum was also observed. Finally, the waveguide mode observed by our IR-SPR analyses showed that EPEC infection decreases the host cell's height to some extent. Together, these observations reveal novel impacts of the pathogen on the host cell architecture and endocytic functions. We suggest that these changes may induce the infiltration of a watery environment into the host cell, and potentially lead to failure of the epithelium barrier functions. Our findings also indicate the great potential of the label-free IR-SPR approach to study the dynamics of host-pathogen interactions with high spatiotemporal sensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W1981129493,"Objective Secondary dystonia commonly presents as hemidystonia and is often refractory to current treatments. We aimed to establish an inducible rat model of hemidystonia utilizing 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP) and to determine the pathophysiology of this model. Methods Two different doses of 3-NP were stereotactically administered into the ipsilateral caudate putamen (CPu) of Wistar rats. Behavioral changes and alterations in the neurotransmitter levels in the basal ganglia were analyzed. We also performed an electromyogram, 7.0-T magnetic resonance imaging and transmission electron microscopy examination to determine the pathophysiology of the model. Results In the CPu region, 3-NP produced mitochondrial cristae rupture, axonal degeneration, increased excitatory synaptic vesicles and necrosis. The extracellular concentrations of excitatory amino acids increased, whereas the inhibitory amino acids decreased in the CPu. Furthermore, an imbalance of neurotransmitters was found in other regions of the basal ganglia with the exception of the external globus pallidus. This study demonstrated that 3-NP administration results in CPu damage, and combined with a neurotransmitter imbalance in the basal ganglia, it produces specific neurobehavioral changes in rats. Right limb (contralateral side of CPu lesion) and trunk dystonic postures, shortened step length and ipsiversive dystonic posturing were observed in these rats. Furthermore, EMG recordings confirmed that co-contraction of the agonist and antagonist muscles could be seen for several seconds in right limbs. Conclusions Stereotactic injection of 3-NP into the ipsilateral CPu of rats established an inducible model for hemidystonia. This effect might result from an imbalance of neurotransmitter levels, which induce dysfunctional activity of the basal ganglia mainly via the cortico-striato-GPi direct pathway. Symptoms in this model were present for 1 week. Activation of the cortico-striato-GPe indirect pathway and rebalance of neurotransmitters may lead to recovery. This rat model may be a suitable tool used to understand and further investigate the pathophysiology of dystonia."
https://openalex.org/W1985820246,"Many animal species exhibit broad-scale latitudinal or longitudinal gradients in their response to biotic and abiotic components of their habitat. Although knowing the underlying mechanism of these patterns can be critical to the development of sound measures for the preservation or recovery of endangered species, few studies have yet identified which processes drive the existence of geographical gradients in habitat selection. Using extensive spatial data of broad latitudinal and longitudinal extent, we tested three hypotheses that could explain the presence of geographical gradients in landscape selection of the endangered boreal woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) during winter in Eastern Canadian boreal forests: 1) climate-driven selection, which postulates that geographic gradients are surrogates for climatic gradients; 2) road-driven selection, which proposes that boreal caribou adjust their selection for certain habitat classes as a function of proximity to roads; and 3) an additive effect of both roads and climate. Our data strongly supported road-driven selection over climate influences. Thus, direct human alteration of landscapes drives boreal caribou distribution and should likely remain so until the climate changes sufficiently from present conditions. Boreal caribou avoided logged areas two-fold more strongly than burnt areas. Limiting the spread of road networks and accounting for the uneven impact of logging compared to wildfire should therefore be integral parts of any habitat management plan and conservation measures within the range of the endangered boreal caribou. The use of hierarchical spatial models allowed us to explore the distribution of spatially-structured errors in our models, which in turn provided valuable insights for generating alternative hypotheses about processes responsible for boreal caribou distribution."
https://openalex.org/W1989478380,"In the study, a gene encoding a putative ethylene response factor of AP2/EREBP family was isolated from cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) and designated as GhERF12. Sequence alignment showed that GhERF12 protein contains a central AP2/ERF domain (58 amino acids) with two functional conserved amino acid residues (ala14 and asp19). Transactivation assay indicated that GhERF12 displayed strong transcription activation activity in yeast cells, suggesting that this protein may be a transcriptional activator in cotton. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that GhERF12 expression in cotton was induced by ACC and IAA. Overexpression of GhERF12 in Arabidopsis affected seedling growth and development. The GhERF12 transgenic plants grew slowly, and displayed a dwarf phenotype. The mean bolting time of the transgenic plants was delayed for about 10 days, compared with that of wild type. Further study revealed that some ethylene-related and auxin-related genes were dramatically up-regulated in the transgenic plants, compared with those of wild type. Collectively, we speculated that GhERF12, as a transcription factor, may be involved in regulation of plant growth and development by activating the constitutive ethylene response likely related to auxin biosynthesis and/or signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1969622107,"NPAS2 (MOP4) is a heme-containing sensor transcription factor responsive to a wide range of intra- and extracellular stimuli, which also functions as a circadian transcription factor. This molecule forms a heterodimer with another circadian transcription factor, BMAL1, and activates transcription via E-box elements, indicating that circadian phase synchronization between NPAS2 and BMAL1 expression is important for the efficient transcriptional activation of target genes. However, details of the mechanism of cell-autonomous circadian transcription of Npas2 remain unclear. Here, we show that one of the ROREs (retinoid-related orphan receptor response elements) in the upstream region of the transcription start site is essential for circadian transcription of the Npas2 gene. Furthermore, we also show that endogenous RORα indeed plays an essential role in cell-autonomous circadian transcription of Npas2, because a damped transcriptional oscillation was observed not only by introduction of a dominant negative form or small interfering RNA but also in embryonic fibroblasts obtained from RORα-mutant (sg/sg) mice. These results indicate that circadian transcription of Npas2 is synchronized with that of Bmal1 in a cell-autonomous nuclear receptor-mediated fashion."
https://openalex.org/W1987846041,"In the pentameric ligand-gated ion channel family, transmitter binds in the extracellular domain and conformational changes result in channel opening in the transmembrane domain. In the muscle nicotinic receptor and other heteromeric members of the family one subunit does not contribute to the canonical agonist binding site for transmitter. A fundamental question is whether conformational changes occur in this subunit. We used records of single channel activity and rate-equilibrium free energy relationships to examine the β1 (non-ACh-binding) subunit of the muscle nicotinic receptor. Mutations to residues in the extracellular domain have minimal effects on the gating equilibrium constant. Positions in the channel lining (M2 transmembrane) domain contribute strongly and relatively late during gating. Positions thought to be important in other subunits in coupling the transmitter-binding to the channel domains have minimal effects on gating. We conclude that the conformational changes involved in channel gating propagate from the binding-site to the channel in the ACh-binding subunits and subsequently spread to the non-binding subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1991408218,"The identification of small molecules capable of directing pluripotent cell differentiation towards specific lineages is highly desirable to both reduce cost, and increase efficiency. Within neural progenitors, LIM homeobox transcription factor 1 alpha (Lmx1a) is required for proper development of roof plate and cortical hem structures of the forebrain, as well as the development of floor plate and midbrain dopaminergic neurons. In this study we generated homologous recombinant cell lines expressing either luciferase or β-lactamase under the control of the Lmx1a promoter, and used these cell lines to investigate kinase-mediated regulation of Lmx1a activity during neuronal differentiation. A screen of 143 small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors yielded 16 compounds that positively or negatively modulated Lmx1a activity. Inhibition of EGF, VEGF and DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) signaling significantly upregulated Lmx1a activity whereas MEK inhibition strongly downregulated its activity. Quantitative FACS analysis revealed that the DNA-PK inhibitor significantly increased the number of Lmx1a+ progenitors while subsequent qPCR showed an upregulation of Notch effectors, the basic helix-loop-helix genes, Hes5 and Hey1. FACS further revealed that DNA-PK-mediated regulation of Lmx1a+ cells is dependent on the rapamycin-sensitive complex, mTORC1. Interestingly, this DNA-PK inhibitor effect was preserved in a co-culture differentiation protocol. Terminal differentiation assays showed that DNA-PK inhibition shifted development of neurons from forebrain toward midbrain character as assessed by Pitx3/TH immunolabeling and corresponding upregulation of midbrain (En1), but not forebrain (FoxG1) transcripts. These studies show that Lmx1a signaling in mouse embryonic stem cells contributes to a molecular cascade establishing neuronal specification. The data presented here identifies a novel regulatory pathway where signaling from DNA-PK appears to suppress midbrain-specific Lmx1a expression."
https://openalex.org/W2010154144,"A typical MR imaging protocol to study the status of atherosclerosis in the carotid artery consists of the application of multiple MR sequences. Since scanner time is limited, a balance has to be reached between the duration of the applied MR protocol and the quantity and quality of the resulting images which are needed to assess the disease. In this study an objective method to optimize the MR sequence set for classification of soft plaque in vessel wall images of the carotid artery using automated image segmentation was developed. The automated method employs statistical pattern recognition techniques and was developed based on an extensive set of MR contrast weightings and corresponding manual segmentations of the vessel wall and soft plaque components, which were validated by histological sections. Evaluation of the results from nine contrast weightings showed the tradeoff between scan duration and automated image segmentation performance. For our dataset the best segmentation performance was achieved by selecting five contrast weightings. Similar performance was achieved with a set of three contrast weightings, which resulted in a reduction of scan time by more than 60%. The presented approach can help others to optimize MR imaging protocols by investigating the tradeoff between scan duration and automated image segmentation performance possibly leading to shorter scanning times and better image interpretation. This approach can potentially also be applied to other research fields focusing on different diseases and anatomical regions."
https://openalex.org/W2081637716,"Currently, it is believed that toad oocyte maturation is dependent on the physiological conditions of winter hibernation. Previous antibody-blocking experiments have demonstrated that toad ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase L1 (tUCHL1) is necessary for germinal vesicle breakdown during toad oocyte maturation. In this paper, we first supply evidence that tUCHL1 is highly evolutionarily conserved. Then, we exclude protein availability and ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase enzyme activity as factors in the response of oocytes to winter hibernation. In the context of MPF (maturation promoting factor) controlling oocyte maturation and to further understand the role of UCHL1 in oocyte maturation, we performed adsorption and co-immunoprecipitation experiments using toad oocyte protein extracts and determined that tUCHL1 is associated with MPF in toad oocytes. Recombinant tUCHL1 absorbed p34cdc2, a component of MPF, in obviously larger quantities from mature oocytes than from immature oocytes, and p13suc1 was isolated from tUCHL1 with a dependence on the ATP regeneration system, suggesting that still other functions may be involved in their association that require phosphorylation. In oocytes from hibernation-interrupted toads, the p34cdc2 protein level was significantly lower than in oocytes from toads in artificial hibernation, providing an explanation for the different quantities isolated by recombinant tUCHL1 pull-down and, more importantly, identifying a mechanism involved in the toad oocyte’s dependence on a low environmental temperature during winter hibernation. Therefore, in toads, tUCHL1 binds p34cdc2 and plays a role in oocyte maturation. However, neither tUCHL1 nor cyclin B1 respond to low temperatures to facilitate oocyte maturation competence during winter hibernation."
