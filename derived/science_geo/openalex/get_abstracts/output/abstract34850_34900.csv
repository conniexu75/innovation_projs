https://openalex.org/W1971234510,"Human follicular B cell lymphomas possess a t(14;18) interchromosomal translocation that juxtaposes the putative proto-oncogene bcl-2 with the immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain locus. We generated minigene constructs representing the bcl-2-Ig fusion gene found at this chromosomal breakpoint. These constructs were placed into the germ line of mice to assess the effects of the t(14;18) during development. The transgene demonstrates a lymphoid pattern of expression and uniformly results in an expanded follicular center cell population. Hyperplastic splenic follicles coalesce to form massive regions of splenic white pulp. Mice over 15 weeks of age demonstrate regional lymphadenopathy with abnormal cellular infiltrates. The expanded lymphoid compartment is composed predominantly of polyclonal B220-positive, IgM/IgD-positive B cells. Provocatively, the bcl-2-Ig transgene confers a survival advantage to a population of mature B cells assessed in vitro. bcl-2-Ig transgenic mice document a prospective role for the t(14;18) in B cell growth and the pathogenesis of follicular lymphoma."
https://openalex.org/W2084015178,"To study the putative precursor proteins (PreA4(695), PreA4(751), and PreA4(770] of Alzheimer's disease A4 amyloid protein, polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies were raised against a recombinant bacterial PreA4(695) fusion protein. These antibodies were used to identify the precursors in different cell lines as well as in human brain homogenates and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The precursors are tyrosine-sulfated, O- and N-glycosylated membrane proteins and have half-lives of 20-30 min in cells. Cells express the polypeptides at their surface but also secrete C-terminal truncated proteins into the medium. These proteins are also found in CSF of both Alzheimer's disease patients and normal individuals. The proteins are derived from their cognate membrane-associated forms by proteolysis and have apparently lost the cytoplasmic and the transmembrane domains. Since the latter contributes to the A4 amyloid sequence, it seems possible that this proteolytic cleavage represents the first step in the formation of A4 amyloid deposits."
https://openalex.org/W1983239749,T lymphocyte chemotactic factor (TCF) was purified to homogeneity from the conditioned media of phytohemagglutinin-stimulated human blood mononuclear leukocytes by a sequence of chromatography procedures. The amino-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified TCF showed identity with neutrophil-activating protein (NAP-1). Both TCF and recombinant NAP-1 (rNAP-1) were chemotactic for neutrophils and T lymphocytes in vitro supporting the identity of TCF with NAP-1. Injection of rNAP-1 into lymphatic drainage areas of lymph nodes in Fisher rats caused accelerated emigration of only lymphocytes in high endothelial venules. Intradermal injection of rNAP-1 caused dose-dependent accumulation of neutrophils and lymphocytes.
https://openalex.org/W2072036820,"Human endothelial cells produced a neutrophil chemotactic factor (NCF) upon stimulation with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The expression of endothelial cell-derived NCF messenger RNA and biological activity was both time- and concentration-dependent. Maximal NCF mRNA expression occurred at 10 and at 2 nanograms per milliliter for TNF and IL-1 beta, respectively; mRNA expression was first observed 1 hour after stimulation and was maintained for at least 24 hours. In situ hybridization analysis showed that NCF mRNA peaked in treated cells by 24 hours, whereas unstimulated cells were negative. These studies demonstrated that endothelial cells may participate in neutrophil-mediated inflammation by synthesizing a chemotactic factor in response to specific monokines and LPS."

A cDNA has been cloned from a skeletal muscle library that encodes a novel glucose transporter protein exhibiting the following properties of an insulin-regulated hexose carrier protein: it is expressed exclusively in adipose tissue, skeletal muscle and heart, the principal organs with insulin-responsive glucose transport; RNA transcribed from the muscle cDNA, when expressed in Xenopus oocytes, encodes a protein capable of cytochalasin B inhibitable 2-deoxyglucose transport; and treatment of isolated rat adipocytes with insulin effects a redistribution of ""muscle"" transports from low density microsomes to the plasma membrane to an extent comparable to the activation of glucose transport."

https://openalex.org/W1566112956,"Using L cell glucocorticoid receptors that have been immunopurified by adsorption to protein A Sepharose with a monoclonal antireceptor antibody, we have developed an assay to study the requirements for maintenance of steroid-binding capacity. After rapid purification by immunoadsorption, heteromeric receptor complexes retain the ability to bind glucocorticoid hormone. When the receptor complexes are warmed at 20 degrees C, steroid-binding capacity is lost, and the 90-kDa heat shock protein (hsp90) dissociates from the receptor. The rates of both temperature- and salt-dependent dissociation of hsp90 parallel the rates of loss of hormone-binding activity. Molybdate and hydrogen peroxide stabilize the hsp90-receptor complex against temperature-dependent dissociation. Molybdate, however, is much more effective in stabilizing steroid-binding capacity than peroxide. Receptors that have been inactivated in the absence of molybdate or peroxide cannot be reactivated. Inactivation of steroid-binding capacity occurs in the presence or absence of reducing agent, and inactivation is not accompanied by receptor cleavage or dephosphorylation. Under no conditions does an hsp90-free receptor bind steroid. Receptor bound to hsp90 can be cleaved to the 27-kDa meroreceptor in the presence of molybdate with retention of both hsp90 and steroid-binding activity. These observations lead us to propose that hsp90 is necessary but not sufficient for maintaining a competent high affinity glucocorticoid-binding site. Although the 27-kDa meroreceptor fragment is not itself sufficient for a competent binding site, it is sufficient when it is associated with hsp90."
https://openalex.org/W2107423274,"MPF extracted from starfish oocytes copurifies with an M phase-specific H1 histone kinase encoded by a homolog of the fission yeast cell cycle control gene cdc2+. The most purified preparations contain p34cdc2 as the only major protein. Activation of the p34cdc2 kinase is correlated with appearance of the MPF activity both in vivo and in vitro. The increase in protein kinase activity is associated with p34cdc2 dephosphorylation and the decrease in protein kinase activity on leaving M phase with rephosphorylation. Microinjection of a peptide perfectly conserved in p34cdc2 from yeast to humans induces meiotic maturation, suggesting that an inhibitory component in G2 arrested oocytes interacts with this region of the p34cdc2 kinase. We propose that initiation of M phase is brought about by the dephosphorylation of p34cdc2, leading to increase in its protein kinase activity."

https://openalex.org/W2004455977,"An immunohistochemical study was conducted to detect the temporal infection sequence of Autographa californica M nuclear polyhedrosis virus in Trichoplusia ni larvae. Staining patterns indicated that the initial infection occurred in the midgut, simultaneously in columnar epithelial and regenerative cells, but that subsequently this tissue recovered. A major envelope glycoprotein stained in a polar fashion when it was expressed in columnar epithelial cells, but not when expressed in other cells types. Systemic infection was mediated by free virus for some tissues whereas infected hemocytes appeared to spread virus to other tissues by an unknown mechanism. A cell to cell spread within several tissues was detected. These results have important implications for baculoviruses engineered for improving their pesticide potential."
https://openalex.org/W1508989149,"On platelets and other cell types, VLA-6 is a typical integrin heterodimer, with alpha 6-beta 1 subunit association. However, on colon carcinoma cell lines and other epithelial cells the alpha 6 subunit associates with a novel protein (called beta 4) rather than the VLA beta 1 subunit. The beta 4 protein differs from beta 1 because (i) it is not recognized by anti-beta 1 antibodies, (ii) it yields different V8 protease cleavage products, (iii) it has a more limited cell distribution, (iv) it has multiple forms, each larger in size than beta 1, and (v) it is susceptible to protease digestion which does not effect beta 1. Although different in many respects, the beta 4 subunit does have partial N-terminal sequence similarity to the already defined integrin beta 1, beta 2, and beta 3 subunits. The presence of alpha 6-beta 4 complexes was demonstrated by coprecipitation of beta 4 with an anti-alpha 6 antibody and by covalent cross-linking experiments. Although alpha 6-beta 4 complexes were present on certain cells, other VLA alpha subunits on those same cells remained associated with the VLA beta 1 subunit to form typical VLA heterodimers (e.g. VLA-1, VLA-2, VLA-3). By the criteria of N-terminal amino acid sequencing, antibody recognition, V8 peptide maps, and reduced/nonreduced gel migration, the alpha 6 subunit which associates with beta 4 appears identical to the alpha 6 associated with the VLA beta 1 subunit on platelets and other cell types. The beta 4 subunit may be of major importance because (i) it is highly abundant on the surface of colon carcinoma cell lines, and (ii) it is highly immunogenic relative to other surface proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1967716439,"The yeast tropomyosin gene, designated TPM1, is present in a single copy per haploid genome and encodes a protein with a predicted molecular weight of 23.5 kd. The protein sequence is homologous to higher cell tropomyosins, including the characteristic hydrophobic-hydrophilic pseudoheptapeptide repeats. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy reveals that tropomyosin is localized with actin cables in wild-type cells. Disruption of TPM1 is not lethal, but results in a reduced growth rate and disappearance of actin cables. Strains carrying the conditional actin mutation act1–2 also lack actin cables; overexpression of tropomyosin in these strains partially restores actin cables. These results strongly suggest that tropomyosin interacts with F actin in vivo and may play an important role in assembling or stabilizing actin cables in yeast."
https://openalex.org/W1517938242,"A procedure has been developed which is much more specific for the solubilization of the elastin-associated microfibrils from fetal bovine nuchal ligament using treatment with reductive saline in place of reductive guanidine hydrochloride buffer. When analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, reductive saline extracts were shown to contain only five major protein bands with Mrs of 340,000, 78,000, 70,000, 31,000, and 25,000. The 31-kDa species was identified immunologically as the previously described macromolecule named microfibril-associated glycoprotein (MAGP) (Gibson, M. A., Hughes, J. L., Fanning, J. C., and Cleary, E. G. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 11429-11436). The proteins were purified by gel permeation, ion exchange, and affinity chromatography. Amino acid analyses showed that each protein had a profile which was distinct from that of MAGP although each was also high in acidic amino acids and cystine. The 340- and 78-kDa species were each demonstrated by immunoelectron microscopy with affinity-purified antibodies to be derived from the elastin-associated microfibris, and these were provisionally named microfibrillar protein 340 (MP340) and microfibrillar protein 78 (MP78), respectively. Each of the above antibodies gave a tissue distribution identical to that of anti-MAGP antibodies, and thus MP340 and MP78 also were identified with the 12-nm microfibrils of nonelastic tissues. MP340 was shown to absorb out completely the microfibrillar immunoreactivity of anti-(reductive guanidine hydrochloride extract) antibodies, indicating that MP340 was (a) the major microfibrillar constituent in these extracts and (b) the second unidentified microfibrillar antigen described previously. The relationship of the 70- and 25-kDa proteins to microfibrils is yet to be established. Immunoblot and immunoabsorption studies showed that MAGP and MP78 were immunologically related to MP340 but not to each other. Cyanogen bromide peptide mapping indicated that MAGP was structurally related to MP340. It is postulated that MAGP and MP78 are constituents of MP340 which in turn is the subunit of which the 12-nm microfibrils are composed."
https://openalex.org/W2042845277,"We have been able to use immunogold labeling with monoclonal antibodies specific for tyrosinated α-tubulin to define new microtubule assembly within the T. brucei pellicular cytoskeleton. Using this approach, we have been able to visualize and define the detyrosination gradient along single microtubules in vivo. New microtubules are seen to invade the cytoskeletal array early in the cell cycle between old microtubules. In post-mitotic cells, a unique form of microtubule assembly occurs, with very short microtubules being intercalated in the array. We propose that these are nucleated by lateral interaction with the MAPs on existing adjacent microtubules. This construction pattern suggests a templated morphogenesis of microtubule arrays with semi-conservative distribution to the daughter cells."

https://openalex.org/W2067082256,"Transcription of the HO gene is controlled by at least eleven trans-acting regulators, which are responsible for limiting expression to mother cells and to one period in the cell cycle. A subset of these regulators and a repeated element (the cell-cycle box, CCB) are required for expression of HO during late G1. We describe gel retardation and footprinting experiments that identify a factor, CCBF (cell-cycle box factor), that binds to multiple cell-cycle box elements. We show that the SWI4 and SWI6 genes are required for formation of the CCBF-promoter complex in vitro, either as components of CCBF or as modulators of CCBF activity. The other SWI genes (SWI1, 2, 3, and 5) are not required. We also show that SWI4 and SWI6 are the only SWI genes required for expression in vivo from the CCB sequences. These observations indicate that the CCBF is responsible for cell-cycle regulation of HO and lead to the view that two of the SWI genes, SWI4 and SWI6, are specifically involved in this regulatory event."
https://openalex.org/W1979447769,"The 21-kD proteins encoded by ras oncogenes (p21Ras) are modified covalently by a palmitate attached to a cysteine residue near the carboxyl terminus. Changing cysteine at position 186 to serine in oncogenic forms produces a nonpalmitylated protein that fails to associate with membranes and does not transform NIH 3T3 cells. Nonpalmitylated p21Ras derivatives were constructed that contained myristic acid at their amino termini to determine if a different form of lipid modification could restore either membrane association or transforming activity. An activated p21Ras, altered in this way, exhibited both efficient membrane association and full transforming activity. Surprisingly, myristylated forms of normal cellular Ras were also transforming. This demonstrates that Ras must bind to membranes in order to transmit a signal for transformation, but that either myristate or palmitate can perform this role. However, the normal function of cellular Ras is diverted to transformation by myristate and therefore must be regulated ordinarily by some unique property of palmitate that myristate does not mimic. Myristylation thus represents a novel mechanism by which Ras can become transforming."
https://openalex.org/W1629538683,"Experiments have been carried out to characterize the binding of lysozyme (LZM) to bacteriol lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The formation of LPS·LZM complexes can be readily demonstrated using either physical-chemical separation techniques or a radiolabeled photoaffinity LPS probe. The binding affinity of LZM for LPS has been estimated to be ∼ 108 liters/mol. Binding of LPS results in loss of LZM enzymatic activity by a noncompetitive inhibition, as assessed by either particulate or soluble substrates. This interaction of LPS with LZM is dictated primarily by hydrophobic interactions and appears to be a general property of both constituents. Binding can be demonstrated with LZM of both human and avian sources, as well as with LPS isolated from a variety of Gram-negative organisms. The addition of LPS to biologically relevant fluids containing LZM results in dose-dependent inhibition of LZM enzymatic activity suggesting that such interactions may have relevance in Gram-negative infections. Finally LZM has been shown to reduce the endotoxic activity of LPS as assessed by gelation of Limulus amoebocyte lysates."
https://openalex.org/W1543750783,"Differentiated rat L6 skeletal muscle cell cultures maintained in glucose-deficient medium containing 25 mM xylose displayed a rapid, reversible, time- and concentration-dependent 3-5-fold increase in glucose transport activity. Glucose deprivation in the continuous presence of insulin (24 h) resulted in an overall 9-10-fold stimulation of glucose transport activity. In contrast, acute (30 min) and chronic (24 h) insulin treatment of L6 cells maintained in high glucose (25 mM)-containing medium resulted in a 1.5- and 4-fold induction of glucose transport activity, respectively. Acute glucose deprivation and/or insulin treatment had no significant effect on the total amount of glucose transporter protein, whereas the long-term insulin- and glucose-dependent regulation of glucose transport activity directly correlated with an increase in the cellular expression of the glucose transporter protein. In situ hybridization of the L6 cells demonstrated a 3-, 4-, and 6-fold increase in glucose transporter mRNA induced by glucose deprivation, insulin, and glucose deprivation plus insulin treatments, respectively. Similarly, Northern blot analysis of total RNA isolated from glucose-deprived, insulin, and glucose-deprived plus insulin-treated cells resulted in a 4-, 3-, and 9-fold induction of glucose transporter mRNA, respectively. The continuous presence of insulin in the medium, either in the presence or absence of glucose, resulted in a transient alteration of the glucose transporter mRNA. The relative amount of the glucose transporter mRNA was maximally increased at 6-12 h which subsequently returned to the basal steady-state level within 48 h. These data demonstrate a role for insulin and glucose in the overall regulation of glucose transporter gene expression which may account for the alteration of glucose transporter activity of muscle tissue observed in pathophysiological states such as type II diabetes mellitus."
https://openalex.org/W1501630033,"We have investigated (by use of semisynthetic insulin analogs and isolated canine hepatocytes) the role of invariant residue PheB24 in determining the affinity of insulin-receptor interactions. Our results confirm that replacement of PheB24 by D-Phe is not detrimental to ligand binding to receptor, show that D-Ala is well tolerated at position B24 (whereas Ala is not), and demonstrate that [GlyB24]insulin retains as much as 78% of the receptor binding potency of native insulin. Additional findings show that replacement of PheB24 by D-Pro or by alpha-aminoisobutyric acid results in analogs with severely decreased binding potency, and that the COOH-terminal domain containing residues B26-B30 plays a positive role in determining receptor binding potency in GlyB24-substituted insulin (whereas it plays a negative role in determining the receptor binding potency of its GlyB25-substituted counterpart). We interpret our results as identifying (a) a critical role for the insulin main chain near residue B24 in determining the affinity of receptor for ligand, (b) the importance of main chain flexibility in achieving a high affinity state of receptor-bound hormone, and (c) a potential interaction of the PheB24 side chain with receptor which initiates main chain structural changes in the natural hormone, but which does not itself confer affinity to ligand-receptor interactions."

https://openalex.org/W1508076157,"Glycolytic enzymes have been observed to associate in vitro with membranes and cytoplasmic filaments in a variety of systems, but their distribution in vivo is contested. We have therefore examined the distribution of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PD) in the intact human erythrocyte using indirect immunofluorescence and affinity-purified rabbit antibodies to G3PD. Antibody specificity was demonstrated by immunoblotting as well as immunofluorescence experiments with ghosts specifically depleted of and reconstituted with G3PD. Anti-G3PD immunolabeling experiments utilized both fixed whole cells and fixed cell suspensions infused with 2.3 M sucrose, frozen and thick-sectioned. In all experiments a two-step fixation protocol was employed which ensured that cytoplasmic hemoglobin was retained when cells were subjected to Triton X-100 permeabilization, the anti-genicity of G3PD was preserved, and antibody penetration was complete. We used mixtures of biotinylated affinity-purified antibodies to G3PD and dichlorotriazinylaminofluorescein-labeled, affinity-purified antibodies to hemoglobin, followed by rhodamine-streptavidin, in double-label experiments. In both whole and sectioned human erythrocytes, G3PD staining was predominantly membrane associated while hemoglobin staining was diffusely distributed throughout the cytoplasm. In isolated ghosts, some G3PD was tightly bound to the membrane and was resistant to elution with phosphate-buffered saline and NAD+/arsenate. However, in immunolabeled rat reticulocytes and erythrocytes G3PD was cytoplasmic. Nucleated human blood cells and platelets also exhibited cytoplasmic G3PD. In approximately 10% of the human erythrocyte population G3PD was also cytoplasmic. These cells were flatter in shape and exhibited strong cytoplasmic immunolabeling for hemoglobin which was sometimes concentrated along the cell membrane; possibly, these cells were late reticulocytes or early erythrocytes. We conclude that G3PD is preferentially associated with the plasma membrane of human erythrocytes in a specific fashion."
https://openalex.org/W1528987874,"The periplasmic histidine transport system of Salmonella typhimurium has been reconstituted in isolated right-side-out membrane vesicles. The reconstituted system is entirely dependent on both the periplasmic protein, HisJ, and the membrane-bound complex, composed of proteins HisQ, HisM, and HisP. Transport is also dependent on the presence of ascorbate and phenazine methosulfate, which provide the energy for transport. Ascorbate oxidation generates a proton-motive-force, which allows ATP synthesis. ATP (or a cogenerated molecule) appears to be the immediate energy donor. Dissipation of the proton-motive-force or reduction of the level of ATP by a variety of treatments results in inhibition of transport. Vanadate inhibits transport, indicating that ATP utilization is necessary to energize transport. The interaction between liganded HisJ and the membrane complex has been measured directly: it displays Michaelis-Menten type kinetics, with a K1/2 of approximately 65 microM. The significance of this finding in terms of transport properties of whole cells is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1499705462,"Abstract CuZn superoxide dismutase is a highly stable dimer of identical subunits with a combined molecular mass of 32,000 daltons. Two human superoxide dismutase genes have been joined in the same translational reading frame, using spacers of different lengths, to encode single chain proteins consisting of two identical human superoxide dismutase subunits. The first construct encodes two directly linked subunits; the terminal glutamine codon of the first gene was changed to a methionine codon and followed immediately by the second gene. The second construct encodes two subunits linked by a 19-amino-acid human immunoglobulin IgA1 hinge sequence. Both constructs produce high levels of catalytically active superoxide dismutase when expressed in Escherichia coli. The protein containing the IgA1 hinge sequence forms polymers up to 750,000 in molecular weight, which are linked together noncovalently by the hydrophobic bonding of the dimer interface. The polymers are soluble, thermostable, and of near normal specific activity. Site-directed in vitro mutagenesis was used to inactivate one of the two human superoxide dismutase subunits. The resulting human superoxide dismutase polymers have approximately 50% activity, thus confirming that the products of both genes are catalytically active. Large amounts of individual polymeric forms have been purified from recombinant yeast and tested for serum stability in rats. The serum half-life is approximately 7 min for both the two-chain wild type human superoxide dismutase dimer (Mr 32,000) and the single chain molecule consisting of a human superoxide dismutase dimer covalently linked by the immunoglobulin hinge region (Mr 34,000), whereas the higher molecular weight polymers (Mr greater than or equal to 68,000) all have half-lives of approximately 145 min."
https://openalex.org/W1518769640,"Abstract Heparin and dermatan sulfate increase the rate of inhibition of thrombin by heparin cofactor II (HCII) approximately 1000-fold by providing a catalytic template to which both the inhibitor and the proteinase bind. A variant form of HCII that binds heparin but not dermatan sulfate has been described recently in two heterozygous individuals (Andersson, T.R., Larsen, M.L., and Abildgaard, U. (1987) Thromb. Res. 47, 243-248). We have now purified the variant HCII (designated HCIIOslo) from the plasma of ne of these individuals. HCIIOslo or normal HCII (11 nM) was incubated with thrombin (9 nM) for 1 min in the presence of heparin or dermatan sulfate. Fifty percent inhibition of thrombin occurred at 26 micrograms/ml dermatan sulfate with normal HCII and greater than 1600 micrograms/ml dermatan sulfate with HCIIOslo. In contrast, inhibition of thrombin occurred at a similar concentration of heparin (1.0-1.5 micrograms/ml) with both inhibitors. To identify the mutation in HCIIOslo, DNA fragments encoding the N-terminal 220 amino acid residues of HCII were amplified from leukocyte DNA by the Taq DNA polymerase chain reaction and both alleles were cloned. A point mutation (G----A) resulting in substitution of His for Arg-189 was found in one allele. The same mutation was constructed in the cDNA of native HCII by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis and expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant HCIIHis-189 reacted with thrombin in the presence of heparin but not dermatan sulfate, confirming that this mutation is responsible for the functional abnormality in HCIIOslo."
https://openalex.org/W1526267918,"Colicin M is unique among the colicins in that it causes lysis of cells. Synthesis of peptidoglycan was inhibited before colicin-induced cell lysis occurred. This suggested that inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis was the primary effect of the colicin which was followed by cell lysis. Following colicin M treatment, soluble peptidoglycan nucleotide precursors accumulated, and radioactivity associated with the membrane-bound carrier lipid almost disappeared. Further metabolism of radiolabeled intermediates bound to the lipid carrier (lipid intermediates) was not inhibited by colicin M. The two lipid intermediates decreased to a level where equal amounts of both were present. The data indicated that translocation of nucleotide precursors to the lipid carrier was not inhibited. In vitro peptidoglycan synthesis agreed with the in vivo results. It is concluded that colicin M inhibits peptidoglycan biosynthesis by preventing regeneration of the lipid carrier."
https://openalex.org/W1532960899,"Abstract The absence of a Watson-Crick base pair at the end of the amino acid acceptor stem is one of the features which distinguishes prokaryotic initiator tRNAs as a class from all other tRNAs. We show that this structural feature prevents Escherichia coli initiator tRNA from acting as an elongator in protein synthesis in vivo. We generated a mutant of E. coli initiator tRNA in which the anticodon sequence is changed from CAU to CUA (the T35A36 mutant). This mutant tRNA has the potential to read the amber termination codon UAG. We then coupled this mutation to others which change the C1.A72 mismatch at the end of the acceptor stem to either a U1:A72 base pair (T1 mutant) or a C1:G72 base pair (G72 mutant). Transformation of E. coli CA274 (HfrC Su- lacZ125am trpEam) with multicopy plasmids carrying the mutant initiator tRNA genes show that mutant tRNAs carrying changes in both the anticodon sequence and the acceptor stem suppress amber codons in vivo, whereas mutant tRNA with changes in the anticodon sequence alone does not. Mutant tRNAs with the above anticodon sequence change are aminoacylated with glutamine in vitro. Measurement of kinetic parameters for aminoacylation by E. coli glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase show that both the nature of the base pair at the end of the acceptor stem and the presence or absence of a base pair at this position can affect aminoacylation kinetics. We discuss the implications of this result on recognition of tRNAs by E. coli glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase."
https://openalex.org/W1582864961,"Our studies, which are aimed at understanding the catalytic mechanism of the alpha subunit of tryptophan synthase from Salmonella typhimurium, use site-directed mutagenesis to explore the functional roles of aspartic acid 60, tyrosine 175, and glycine 211. These residues are located close to the substrate binding site of the alpha subunit in the three-dimensional structure of the tryptophan synthase alpha 2 beta 2 complex. Our finding that replacement of aspartic acid 60 by asparagine, alanine, or tyrosine results in complete loss of activity in the reaction catalyzed by the alpha subunit supports a catalytic role for aspartic acid 60. Since the mutant form with glutamic acid at position 60 has partial activity, glutamic acid 60 may serve as an alternative catalytic base. The mutant form in which tyrosine 175 is replaced by phenylalanine has substantial activity; thus the phenolic hydroxyl of tyrosine 175 is not essential for catalysis or substrate binding. Yanofsky and colleagues have identified many missense mutant forms of the alpha subunit of tryptophan synthase from Escherichia coli. Two of these inactive mutant forms had either tyrosine 175 replaced by cysteine or glycine 211 replaced by glutamic acid. Surprisingly, a second-site revertant which contained both of these amino acid changes was partially active. These results indicated that the second mutation must compensate in some way for the first. We now extend the studies of the effects of specific amino acid replacements at positions 175 and 211 by two techniques: 1) characterization of several mutant forms of the alpha subunit from S. typhimurium prepared by site-directed mutagenesis and 2) computer graphics modeling of the substrate binding site of the alpha subunit using the x-ray coordinates of the wild type alpha 2 beta 2 complex from S. typhimurium. We conclude that the restoration of alpha subunit activity in the doubly altered second-site revertant results from restoration of the proper geometry of the substrate binding site."
https://openalex.org/W1489143471,"The capacity of four oligopurine•oligopyrimidine (pur•pyr) sequences with different lengths of interruptions in the center [GAA)4(N)n(GAA)4G) (n = 3, 5, 7, and 9) to adopt intramolecular DNA triplexes was evaluated in recombinant plasmids. The hyperreactive patterns of the pur•pyr inserts to specific chemical probes (OsO4, diethyl pyrocarbonate, and dimethyl sulfate) at the base pair level demonstrate that intramolecular triplexes with identical 12-base triads in the stem but with different loop sizes (4, 6, 8, and 10 bases) can form in supercoiled plasmids. Furthermore, the extent of OsO4 modification was measured as a function of temperature and of average negative supercoil density. In addition, the transition free energy of B-DNA to triplexes at pH 4.5 was determined by two-dimensional electrophoresis. These comparative studies show that longer loops require more supercoil energy for triplex formation and are less thermostable than triplexes with shorter loops. Also, it may be that not only the loop size but the base composition of the loop region affects the structural transition and triplex stability. Thus, these results significantly broaden the range of natural pur.pyr sequences that may adopt triplexes."
https://openalex.org/W1517413858,"Abstract The effects of interruptions in the homopurine bias and the G+C content of the homopurine.homopyrimidine (pur.pyr) sequences on intramolecular triplex formation and stability in supercoiled plasmids were evaluated. In addition, the interconversion of triplex and duplex, after altering the stabilizing factors (low pH or supercoiling), was studied. We conclude: (a) a 42-base pair pur.pyr sequence with three consecutive interruptions does not form a large triplex with three unpaired nucleotides in the stem. Instead, a mixture of two smaller (27- and 28-nucleotide) triplexes forms. (b) A 28-nucleotide sequence with a single interruption forms a triplex with one unpaired nucleotide in the stem. This interruption causes the triplex to be 7 degrees C less thermostable and requires more superhelical energy for formation than the control triplex. (c) As the G+C content of a pur.pyr sequence increases, the thermostability of the triplex increases and the triplex requires less supercoiling for formation. (d) The interconversion between duplex and triplex is fast. After negative supercoiling is removed, all triplex becomes duplex in about 3 min. When the pH is shifted from 8.0 to 5.2, the conversion of duplex to triplex in a negatively supercoiled plasmid is complete in less than 2 min. Hence, these kinetic properties are consistent with important biological roles for triplexes. In summary, the results from both this and the accompanying paper show that a substantial amount of sequence imperfections is tolerated for triplex formation and stability."
https://openalex.org/W1568636663,"An important function of the mammalian nonerythroid alpha-spectrin chain (alpha-fodrin) that distinguishes it from the closely related erythroid isoform is its ability to bind calmodulin. By analysis of a series of deleted recombinant spectrin fusion proteins, we have identified a region in the nonerythroid alpha chain involved in calcium-dependent binding of calmodulin. The region is distinctive in that the sequence is absent from the homologous domain of the erythroid alpha chain and diverges from the normal internal repeat structure observed throughout other spectrins. In order to determine limits of this functional site, a synthetic peptide as small as 24 residues was shown to compete with either recombinant or brain alpha-spectrin in binding to calmodulin. The active peptide, which was derived from a segment between repeats 11 and 12, was composed of the following sequence: Lys-Thr-Ala-Ser-Pro-Trp-Lys-Ser-Ala-Arg-Leu-Met-Val-His-Thr-Val-Ala-Thr-Phe-Asn - Ser-Ile-Lys-Glu. Comparison of this sequence with functional sites in other diverse calcium-dependent calmodulin-binding proteins has revealed a structural motif common to all of these proteins, namely clusters of hydrophobic residues interspersed with basic residues. When folded into alpha-helical conformations, these binding sites are predicted to form amphipathic structures."
https://openalex.org/W1662139478,"As a preliminary to the understanding of the function of the highly conserved Escherichia coli heat shock protein HtpG, the protein was purified and partially characterized. The htpG gene was subcloned into the inducible expression vector, pT7-6. Upon induction, the HtpG protein accumulated to approximately 30% of the total protein in the cell. A purification scheme was devised which involved column chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, hydroxylapatite, and Sephacryl S-200. The amino acid composition of the purified protein corresponded closely with the predicted amino acid composition derived from the DNA sequence, and the sequence of the 8 amino-terminal residues matched the predicted sequence exactly. The molecular weight of the denatured protein is 65,500 and the native molecular weight is 144,620, as calculated by using both the Stokes radius and the sedimentation coefficient. As the molecular weight predicted from the DNA sequence is 71,429, this indicates the HtpG protein is a dimer. The HtpG protein was found to be a phosphoprotein. Thus, HtpG is structurally similar to its eukaryotic homologue, hsp83, which is also a phosphoprotein and a dimer."
https://openalex.org/W1595436649,"The dimeric protein L7/L12 from bacterial ribosomes has a highly elongated and flexible structure. We have, using 1H NMR methods, analyzed the extent of the flexible region and also the size of the organized structures of the molecule. A number of mutants of the protein as well as monomeric and dimeric forms of the protein and a COOH-terminal fragment have been used for the identification of certain resonances. Thus, residues 37-50 were found to be highly mobile whereas the amino-terminal and COOH-terminal regions are organized into folded domains. The flexibility between the domains and its relation to functional properties of the protein are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1658558754,"The precursor to rat liver mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase has been expressed in Escherichia coli JM105 using the pKK233-2 expression vector. This mammalian natural precursor has been isolated as a soluble dimeric protein. The amino-terminal sequence and the amino acid composition of the isolated protein correspond to those predicted from the inserted cDNA (Mattingly, J. R., Jr., Rodriguez-Berrocal, F. J., Gordon, J., Iriarte, A., and Martinez-Carrion, M. (1987) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 149, 859-865). The isolated precursor contains bound pyridoxal phosphate and shows catalytic activity with a specific activity equal to that of the mature form of the enzyme. This precursor can also be processed by mitochondria into a form with the sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis mobility of mature enzyme. The isolation of this precursor as a stable and catalytically active entity indicates that the presequence peptide does not necessarily interfere with much of the folding and basic structural properties of the mature protein component."
https://openalex.org/W1513317182,"Yeast DNA polymerases I and III have been well characterized physically, biochemically, genetically and immunologically. DNA polymerase II is present in very small amounts, and only partially purified preparations have been available for characterization, making comparison with DNA polymerases I and III difficult. Recently, we have shown that DNA polymerases II and III are genetically distinct (Sitney et al., 1989). In this work, we show that polymerase II is also genetically distinct from polymerase I, since polymerase II can be purified in equal amounts from wild-type and mutant strains completely lacking DNA polymerase I activity. Thus, yeast contains three major nuclear DNA polymerases. The core catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase II was purified to near homogeneity using a reconstitution assay. Two factors that stimulate the core polymerase were identified and used to monitor activity during purification and analysis. The predominant species of the most highly purified preparation of polymerase II is 132,000 Da. However, polymerase activity gels suggest that the 132,000-Da form of DNA polymerase II is probably an active proteolytic fragment derived from a 170,000-Da protein. The highly purified polymerase fractions contain a 3'----5'-exonuclease activity that purifies at a constant ratio with polymerase during the final two purification steps. However, DNA polymerase II does not copurify with a DNA primase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1479918689,"A stretch of 10 consecutive dipeptides with the sequence -X-Ala- or -X-Pro-, possible cleavage sites for dipeptidyl aminopeptidase (DPAPase) activity, are located in the prepro-region of the alkaline extracellular protease (AEP) beginning at Leu14. Evidence for DPAPase processing of this dipeptide stretch was obtained by characterizing the polypeptide secreted by a strain carrying a xpr6 mutation. The secreted polypeptide reacted with antibodies specific for AEP and was essentially identical to the 52-kilodalton intracellular AEP precursor based on mobility during sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, content of N-linked carbohydrate, and peptide mapping. Amino-terminal amino acid sequencing of this secreted precursor revealed that it consisted of at least three major polypeptides. One began at the end of the stretch of dipeptides, and two of the others began two and four amino acids upstream. These results confirm that DPAPase activity is involved in the formation of the 52-kilodalton AEP precursor. In other reported cases of DPAPase processing, the dipeptides are located directly upstream of the mature polypeptide. For AEP, the dipeptide stretch is located over 120 amino acids upstream from the N terminus of mature AEP. The novel location of the dipeptide stretch may provide a mechanism for preventing premature activation of AEP in the secretory pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1525587735,"Abstract Forty cDNA clones corresponding to the bifunctional NAD-dependent methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase-methenyltetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase enzyme were isolated from a mouse lambda gt11 library. Two classes of cDNA clones were shown by Northern analysis to correspond to the two mRNA species of 1.7 and 2.0 kilobases present in transformed cells but not in normal tissues and that apparently are derived from alternate polyadenylation signals. The 1050-base pair coding region encodes a protein of 350 amino acids which contains a putative mitochondrial-targeting signal peptide of 34 amino acids following the initiator methionine. The 20 amino acids immediately following the signal peptide correspond exactly to those determined by sequence analysis of the amino terminus of the purified protein. The derived amino acid sequence of the NAD-dependent dehydrogenase-cyclohydrolase shows extensive homology with the corresponding amino-terminal sequence of the trifunctional NADP-dependent dehydrogenase-cyclohydrolase-synthetase enzyme from human cells (approximately 40%), yeast cytosol (approximately 36%), and yeast mitochondria (approximately 45%)."
https://openalex.org/W1566309563,"Endothelial cell insulin receptors mediate the transcytosis of insulin from luminal to abluminal cell surface. We have investigated the kinetics of insulin receptor translocation by immunoprecipitation of radiolabeled receptors at various times before and after trypsin treatment of intact endothelial cells. Insulin receptors were constitutively internalized with t½ = 18 ± 2 min and were recycled to the cell surface. Insulin stimulated receptor internalization and externalization rates 2.6- and 2.4-fold, respectively. Changes in cell-surface binding of 125I-insulin were consistent with the receptor translocation rates observed in surface-labeling experiments. Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) treatment increased the rate of insulin-stimulated receptor externalization 1.7-fold. PMA treatment increased the constitutive externalization rate 3.5-fold without affecting the constitutive internalization rate, suggesting that recycling might occur via a mobilization of receptors from intracellular sites in a manner independent of internalization rate. Analysis of the intracellular distribution of receptors by 125I-insulin binding and immunogold electron microscopy revealed that less than one-third of the total insulin receptor pool resided on the cell surface. In summary, endothelial cell insulin receptors are constitutively recycled, and internalization and externalization rates are increased by receptor occupancy and PMA treatment."

https://openalex.org/W1537103409,"In order to characterize the function of the COOH-terminal (c) region of eukaryotic signal peptides, a 14-amino acid long segment was deleted from a secreted rat liver and intestinal protein, preapolipoprotein-A-IV. This deletion spanned the c-region plus all potential signal peptidase cleavage sites. The functional consequences of this mutation were assessed using an in vitro transcription/translation/microsomal membrane processing system. Removal of these residues had no effect on interaction of the nascent preprotein with signal recognition particle as measured by a translational arrest assay. Although no signal peptidase cleavage of the mutant was detected, the efficiency of its co-translational translocation was similar to the wild type protein. A postinitiation translocation assay was utilized to compare the translocation capabilities of nascent wild type and mutant proteins as their chain lengths were progressively increased. No difference was detected between the two species suggesting that their initial conformations are functionally equivalent as measured by the translocation machinery. We conclude from these studies of preapolipoprotein-A-IV that (i) the efficiency of translocation is not dependent on signal peptidase cleavage and (ii) structural features present in the c-region of the signal peptide are not necessary for interaction with signal recognition particle or for subsequent targeting to, and translocation across, microsomal membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1561383091,"Abstract Proteolytic modification of the native alkaline phosphatase dimer is restricted to sites in the amino-terminal portion of the sequence. Complementing previous studies of the product of trypsin cleavage at the R-11, A-12 bond (Roberts, C. H., and Chlebowski, J. F. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 729-733; Roberts, C. H., and Chlebowski, J. F. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 7557-7561) circular dichroic spectroscopy indicates that cleavage at this site results in a rearrangement of secondary structure and change in tertiary structure as monitored in the far and near UV regions, respectively. Under more vigorous reaction conditions, trypsin cleaves at the R-35, D-36 bond. The deletion of an additional 24 residues yields a species whose functional and structural properties are similar to the initial product of trypsin cleavage. Treatment of the enzyme with Protease V-8 results in cleavage at the E-9, N-10 bond. In contrast to the products of trypsin treatment, this truncated enzyme is similar to the native enzyme. These results indicate that the residues at the N-10 and R-11 positions play a unique role in maintaining the structural integrity and catalytic potency of the enzyme although this locus is distant from the enzyme active centers. These observations are discussed in terms of the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1561262222,"The binding of soluble, multimeric ligands of the major cleavage fragment of complement component 3 (C3b) to polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) has been examined. The oligomers bound entirely via complement C3 receptor type 1 (CR1). There was a single affinity of binding (0.65 nM) at 37 degrees C, while this high affinity binding accounted for only a minority of ligand bound at 0 degree C, with the rest showing a 50-100-fold lower affinity. Azide, fluoride, cytochalasin B, and colchicine had no effect on oligomer binding to PMN. Binding of oligomers had no effect on CR1 expression by PMN. C3b oligomers were not spontaneously internalized by PMN, but were internalized in response to phorbol dibutyrate (PDBu). Both CR1 initially present on the PMN plasma membrane and CR1 initially present in the internal pool of receptors were able to participate in PDBu-induced ligand internalization. C3b oligomers attached to the detergent-insoluble cell cytoskeleton during incubation at 37 degrees C, but cytochalasin B did not inhibit PDBu-induced ligand internalization. Internalized ligand was no longer associated with the detergent-insoluble cytoskeleton. These data demonstrate that 1) some CR1 diffusion is required for optimal oligomer binding; 2) high affinity ligand is not a signal for plasma membrane expression of the internal pool of CR1; 3) CR1 cross-linking is not a sufficient signal for endocytosis; and 4) functional CR1 association with the cytoskeleton which occurs at the plasma membrane is not required for ligand internalization."
https://openalex.org/W1522583447,"Abstract During the purification of RNA polymerase from Xanthomonas campestris pv. oryzae, a new subunit named k was found to be associated with this enzyme. The removal of subunit k from holoenzyme by DEAE-cellulose column chromatography results in a decrease in specific activity of the enzyme. The readdition of subunit k to subunit k-depleted holoenzyme results in restoration of enzymatic activity. Subunit k increase the activity of RNA polymerase; the activation was in proportion to the concentration of subunit k added. Antiserum against holoenzyme devoid of subunit k was prepared. This antiserum did not react with purified subunit k; therefore, subunit k may not be the proteolytic fragment of the beta, beta', sigma, or alpha subunit. When this antiserum was used to precipitate RNA polymerase obtained from a crude extract of bacterial cells, subunit k was coprecipitated as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoretic analysis. The molecular mass of subunit k is approximately 29 kDa, and the molar ratio of beta:beta':sigma:alpha:k was estimated to be 1:1:1:2:4. When native Xp10 DNA was used as template, subunit k stimulated subunit k-depleted holoenzyme, but not core enzyme. When the synthetic polynucleotide poly[d(A-T)] was used, subunit k activated both subunit k-depleted holoenzyme and core enzyme. Subunit k also activated the binding of RNA polymerase to template DNA."
