The mechanism of the effect of this compound is not completely known. In recent experiments, however, it has been shown that dithranol forms a complex with nucleic acids, and it was proposed that dithranol thereby acts as a cytostatic agent1. To verify this hypothesis the effect of dithranol on the thymidine incorporation of guinea-pig epidermis was investigated. It was shown that twelve hours application of dithranol in the form of an ointment decreases the number of labelled cells to a third of that of the untreated epidermis2."

https://openalex.org/W2049482150,"THE discussion about “pink spot” its relation to schizophrenia and the identity of the substance(s) giving the typical reaction is still going on1–3. Because of the theoretical and practical importance of the problem we want to report briefly our observations on a series of ninety-six urine samples from patients, mainly women, with various mental diseases at the Neevengarden Sykehus, Bergen, Norway. The diagnoses are in accordance with the official list used in Norway and were made solely on the basis of the patients' clinical condition. Forty-six of the cases were classified as schizophrenia, while fifty patients suffered from other mental diseases. The urines were brought to the Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Haukeland Sykehus, where they were analysed, without knowledge of the diagnosis, using the original method described by Friedhoff and van Winkle4. In Table 1 the colours of the spots after staining with ninhydrin and with RF values near that given by Friedhoff and van Winkle5 are listed according to the drugs administered to the patients. It is easy to see that there is a very close correlation between the nature of the spot and the drug administered. There are, indeed, only a few exceptions in which either no spot was found in the expected position or a “pink spot” was found in patients not under treatment."

Treatments with gamma irradiation under 50 kr. have been shown to disinfest as well as improve the storage life of fresh pineapples without producing undesirable changes in the fruit colour, flavour and sweetness1."

Simultaneous administration of hydrocortisone to rats on a diet of Lathyrus odoratus partially reduced the increased amount of neutral salt soluble collagen in skin4; although sodium salicylate was more effective than hydrocortisone. The present investigation was undertaken to ascertain whether the simultaneous treatment of lathyritic rats with anti-rheumatic drugs influenced the increased concentration of hydroxyproline in the urine."
