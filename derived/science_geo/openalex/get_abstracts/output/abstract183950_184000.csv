https://openalex.org/W2054820743,"BAX and BAK are ""multidomain"" proapoptotic proteins that initiate mitochondrial dysfunction but also localize to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Mouse embryonic fibroblasts deficient for BAX and BAK (DKO cells) were found to have a reduced resting concentration of calcium in the ER ([Ca2+]er) that results in decreased uptake of Ca2+ by mitochondria after Ca2+ release from the ER. Expression of SERCA (sarcoplasmic-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ adenosine triphosphatase) corrected [Ca2+]er and mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in DKO cells, restoring apoptotic death in response to agents that release Ca2+ from intracellular stores (such as arachidonic acid, C2-ceramide, and oxidative stress). In contrast, targeting of BAX to mitochondria selectively restored apoptosis to ""BH3-only"" signals. A third set of stimuli, including many intrinsic signals, required both ER-released Ca2+ and the presence of mitochondrial BAX or BAK to fully restore apoptosis. Thus, BAX and BAK operate in both the ER and mitochondria as an essential gateway for selected apoptotic signals."

These modern populations derive their gene pools from ancestral populations that arose in Africa, Central Asia, and East Asia. Subsequent spread can be attributed to human migratory fluxes such as the prehistoric colonization of Polynesia and the Americas, the neolithic introduction of farming to Europe, the Bantu expansion within Africa, and the slave trade."
https://openalex.org/W2115473506,"A seeded growth method for the fabrication of high-permeance, high-separation-factor zeolite (siliceous ZSM-5, [Si96O192]-MFI) membranes is reported. The method consists of growing the crystals of an oriented seed layer to a well-intergrown film by avoiding events that lead to a loss of preferred orientation, such as twin overgrowths and random nucleation. Organic polycations are used as zeolite crystal shape modifiers to enhance relative growth rates along the desirable out-of-plane direction. The polycrystalline films are thin (approximately 1 micrometer) with single grains extending along the film thickness and with large in-plane grain size (approximately 1 micrometer). The preferred orientation is such that straight channels with an open diameter of approximately 5.5 angstroms run down the membrane thickness. Comparison with previously reported membranes shows that these microstructurally optimized films have superior performance for the separation of organic mixtures with components that have small differences in size and shape, such as xylene isomers."

Here, we report a previously unknown murine norovirus. Analysis of Murine Norovirus 1 infection revealed that signal transducer and activator of transcription 1–dependent innate immunity, but not T and B cell–dependent adaptive immunity, is essential for norovirus resistance. The identification of host molecules essential for murine norovirus resistance may provide targets for prevention or control of an important human disease."
https://openalex.org/W2033124959,"During ""nondamaging"" exercise, skeletal muscle markedly releases interleukin (IL)-6, and it has been suggested that one biological role of this phenomenon is to inhibit the production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- alpha, which is known to cause pathogenesis such as insulin resistance and atherosclerosis. To test this hypothesis, we performed three experiments in which eight healthy males either rested (CON), rode a bicycle for 3 h (EX), or were infused with recombinant human IL-6 (rhIL-6) for 3 h while they rested. After 2.5 h, the volunteers received a bolus of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide endotoxin (0.06 ng/kg) i.v. to induce low-grade inflammation. In CON, plasma TNF-alpha increased significantly in response to endotoxin. In contrast, during EX, which resulted in elevated IL-6, and rhIL-6, the endotoxin-induced increase in TNF-alpha was totally attenuated. In conclusion, physical exercise and rhIL-6 infusion at physiological concentrations inhibit endotoxin-induced TNF-alpha production in humans. Hence, these data provide the first experimental evidence that physical activity mediates antiinflammatory activity and suggest that the mechanism include IL-6, which is produced by and released from exercising muscles."
https://openalex.org/W2151966368,"Mucus hypersecretion and persistent airway inflammation are common features of various airway diseases, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cystic fibrosis. One key question is: does the associated airway inflammation in these diseases affect mucus production? If so, what is the underlying mechanism? It appears that increased mucus secretion results from increased mucin gene expression and is also frequently accompanied by an increased number of mucous cells (goblet cell hyperplasia/metaplasia) in the airway epithelium. Many studies on mucin gene expression have been directed toward Th2 cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-4, IL-9, and IL-13 because of their known pathophysiological role in allergic airway diseases such as asthma. However, the effect of these cytokines has not been definitely linked to their direct interaction with airway epithelial cells. In our study, we treated highly differentiated cultures of primary human tracheobronchial epithelial (TBE) cells with a panel of cytokines (interleukin-1α, 1औ, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, and tumor necrosis factor α). We found that IL-6 and IL-17 could stimulate the mucin genes, MUC5B andMUC5AC. The Th2 cytokines IL-4, IL-9, and IL-13 did not stimulate MUC5AC or MUC5B in our experiments. A similar stimulation of MUC5B/Muc5b expression by IL-6 and IL-17 was demonstrated in primary monkey and mouse TBE cells. Further investigation of MUC5B expression demonstrated that IL-17's effect is at least partly mediated through IL-6 by a JAK2-dependent autocrine/paracrine loop. Finally, evidence is presented to show that both IL-6 and IL-17 mediate MUC5Bexpression through the ERK signaling pathway.

Textbook of Respiratory Medicine. 3rd Ed. Saunders, Philadelphia2000: 443-538Google Scholar). The mucus hypersecretion by itself might increase morbidity and mortality in these conditions by obstructing the airways and impairing gas exchange (2Jeffery P.K. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2001; 164: S28-S38Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). One of the main components of mucus secretion is the mucin protein. Mucins are a family of large glycoproteins that have a molecular mass of several thousand kilodaltons, and they are a major determinant of the viscoelasticity of mucus secretion (3King M. Fed. Proc. 1980; 39: 3080-3085PubMed Google Scholar). There are currently 19 identified mucin genes highly expressed in tissues, such as lung, nose, salivary glands, GI tract, and uterus (4Voynow J.A. Paediatr. Respir. Rev. 2002; 3: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 5Kaliner M. Shelhamer J.H. Borson B. Nadel J. Patow C. Marom Z. Am. Rev. Respirat. Dis. 1986; 134: 612-621PubMed Google Scholar). In the lung, synthesis and secretion of mucins are restricted largely to the airway with little to no expression in alveolar airspaces (1Murray J.F. Textbook of Respiratory Medicine. 3rd Ed. Saunders, Philadelphia2000: 443-538Google Scholar). Although at least eight mucin genes (MUC 1, 2, 4, 5AC, 5B, 7, 8, 13) have been found to be expressed in adult human lung (4Voynow J.A. Paediatr. Respir. Rev. 2002; 3: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), MUC5AC andMUC5B appear to be the predominant genes expressed, and their glycoprotein products are the most abundant in mucus secretions (4Voynow J.A. Paediatr. Respir. Rev. 2002; 3: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 6Hovenberg H.W. Davies J.R. Herrmann A. Lindén C.J. Carlstedt I.

MUC5AC appears to be produced mainly in the airway epithelium by goblet cells (8Hovenberg H.W. Davies J.R. Carlstedt I. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 10Chen Y. Zhao Y.H. Di Y.P. Wu R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2001; 25: 542-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), while MUC5B is mostly produced in the underlying submucosal glands (10Chen Y. Zhao Y.H. Di Y.P. Wu R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2001; 25: 542-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In contrast to this normal distribution pattern, we previously showed thatMUC5B could be expressed by surface airway epithelial cells in addition to the expression by submucosal gland cells in airway tissue sections obtained from COPD and asthma (10Chen Y. Zhao Y.H. Di Y.P. Wu R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2001; 25: 542-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), whileMUC5AC expression was still restricted at the surface epithelial cells in these tissue sections. These results suggest that changes in MUC gene expression, especially MUC5B, are associated with airway diseases. The source of increased mucus production in diseases such as asthma and COPD is due at least partially to an increased number of goblet cells in the airway epithelium (11Jeffery P.K. Chest. 2000; 117: 251S-260SAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 12Aikawa T. Shimura S. Sasaki H. Ebina M. Takishima T.

J. 1996; 9: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Studies have linked goblet cell metaplasia to the increase of mucin gene expression in airway epithelial cells (10Chen Y. Zhao Y.H. Di Y.P. Wu R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2001; 25: 542-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar,14Zuhdi Alimam M. Piazza F.M. Selby D.M. Letwin N. Huang L. Rose M.C. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 22: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In recent years, inflammatory cytokines have been linked to increased mucus production by their effects on mucin gene expression in the airway epithelium (15Cohn L.A. Adler K.B. Exp. Lung Res. 1992; 18: 299-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). For example, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α has been shown to induce expression of MUC2 (16Levine S.J. Larivee P. Logun C. Angus C.W. Ognibene F.P. Shelhamer J.H. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1995; 12: 196-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) andMUC5AC (17Borchers M.T. Carty M.P. Leikauf G.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: L549-L555PubMed Google Scholar) in NCI-H292 cells. More recently, IL-1औ has also been shown to induce MUC2 and MUC5ACexpression in NCI-H292 cells (18Koo J.S. Kim Y.D. Jetten A.M. Belloni P. Nettesheim P. Exp. Lung Res. 2002; 28: 315-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 19Kim Y.D. Kwon E.J. Park D.W. Song S.Y. Yoon S.K. Baek S.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 1112-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). From studies of asthma, evidence suggests that Th2 cytokines IL-4, 9, and 13 can also affect mucin gene expression. Transgenic overexpression of IL-4 in murine lungs causes mucous cell metaplasia and an induction of MUC5AC expression in the airway epithelium (20Temann U.A. Prasad B. Gallup M.W. Basbaum C. Ho S.B. Flavell R.A. Rankin J.A. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1997; 16: 471-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). However, direct treatment of IL-4 on airway epithelial cell culture has produced conflicting results. One group reported a decrease in MUC5AC expression (21Jayawickreme S.P. Gray T. Nettesheim P. Eling T. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: L596-L603PubMed Google Scholar), another reported no change (22Rose M.C. Piazza F.M. Chen Y.A. Alimam M.Z. Bautista M.V. Letwin N. Rajput B. J. Aerosol. Med. 2000; 13: 245-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and a third reported an increase ofMUC2 expression by IL-4 (23Dabbagh K. Takeyama K. Lee H.M. Ueki I.F. Lausier J.A. Nadel J.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 6233-6237PubMed Google Scholar). It was later suggested that IL-13 was also important for the development of asthmatic phenotypes such as airway hyperreactivity, eosinophilic infiltration, and mucous cell metaplasia (24Grünig G. Warnock M. Wakil A.E. Venkayya R. Brombacher F. Rennick D.M. Sheppard D. Mohrs M. Donaldson D.D. Locksley R.M. Corry D.B.

Science. 1998; 282: 2258-2261Crossref PubMed Scopus (2388) Google Scholar).In vivo models using transgenic mice (26Zhu Z. Homer R.J. Wang Z. Chen Q. Geba G.P. Wang J. Zhang Y. Elias J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 779-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1491) Google Scholar) and intranasal (14Zuhdi Alimam M. Piazza F.M. Selby D.M. Letwin N. Huang L. Rose M.C. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 22: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) or intratracheal (27Singer M. Lefort J. Vargaftig B.B. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2002; 26: 74-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) injections of IL-13 consistently showed increased goblet cells in the airways of mice. However, one limitation of these in vivo experiments was their inability to determine the exact mechanism of how the cytokine affects mucin gene expression. Does IL-13 interact directly with receptors on the airway epithelium to induce mucin gene expression, or are its effects mediated through inflammatory cell recruitment or the induction of local mediator release from surrounding cells such as fibroblasts or smooth muscle cells? For instance, significant infiltration of eosinophils and neutrophils within 4–8 h after the instillation of IL-13 was observed (28Shim J.J. Dabbagh K. Ueki I.F. Dao-Pick T. Burgel P.R. Takeyama K. Tam D.C. Nadel J.A. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol. Physiol. 2001; 280: L134-L140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since products from both neutrophils and eosinophils can induce mucin gene expression (29Voynow J.A. Young L.R. Wang Y. Horger T. Rose M.C. Fischer B.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: L835-L843PubMed Google Scholar, 30Fischer B.M. Voynow J.A. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2002; 26: 447-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 31Burgel P.R. Lazarus S.C. Tam D.C. Ueki I.F. Atabai K. Birch M. Nadel J.A. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 5948-5954Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), one cannot determine convincingly whether it is IL-13 or the inflammatory cells and their products that are responsible for the mucous cell metaplasia. In airway epithelial cell cultures, IL-13 has been shown to enhance mucous cell differentiation in human nasal (32Laoukili J. Perret E. Willems T. Minty A. Parthoens E. Houcine O. Coste A. Jorissen M. Marano F. Caput D. Tournier F. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1817-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) and pig tracheal (33Kondo M. Tamaoki J. Takeyama K. Nakata J. Nagai A. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2002; 27: 536-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) epithelial cells. However, in these studies, the requirement of IL-13 treatment for 10–14 days is difficult to understand. In another recent study, IL-13 was also shown to inhibit MUC5AC gene expression in nasal epithelial cells (34Kim C.H. Song K.S. Koo J.S. Kim H.U. Cho J.Y. Kim H.J. Yoon J.H. Acta Otolaryngol. 2002; 122: 638-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and had no effect in NCI-H292 cells (22Rose M.C. Piazza F.M. Chen Y.A. Alimam M.Z. Bautista M.V. Letwin N. Rajput B. J. Aerosol. Med. 2000; 13: 245-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). IL-9 has also been shown to have the ability to stimulate mucous cell hyperplasia in vivo (35Temann U.A. Geba G.P. Rankin J.A. Flavell R.A. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1307-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar) as well as mucin gene expressionin vitro (36Longphre M. Li D. Gallup M. Drori E. Ordoñez C.L.

Nicolaides N.C. Am. J. Respirat. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 22: 649-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). However, gene knockout mice of IL-9 showed that IL-9 was necessary for mucous cell hyperplasia in a granuloma model of disease (38Townsend J.M. Fallon G.P. Matthews J.D. Smith P. Jolin E.H. McKenzie N.A. Immunity. 2000; 13: 573-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) but not in an allergic asthma model (39McMillan S.J. Bishop B. Townsend M.J. McKenzie A.N. Lloyd C.M. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In cell cultures, stimulation of MUC5AC by IL-9 could be seen (36Longphre M. Li D. Gallup M. Drori E. Ordoñez C.L. Redman T. Wenzel S. Bice D.E. Fahy J.V. Basbaum C. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: 1375-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 37Louahed J. Toda M. Jen J. Hamid Q.

Biol. 2000; 22: 649-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) but the cells used were undifferentiated TBE cells or cancerous cell lines. To further define the roles of cytokines in mucin gene expression, we used well differentiated primary cultures of human tracheobronchial epithelial (TBE) cells (40Wu R. Zhao Y.H. Chang M.M. European Respir. J. 1997; 10: 2398-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 41Wu R. Schiff L.J. In Vitro Models of Respiratory Epithelium. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1986: 1-26Google Scholar) to determine which cytokines can stimulate MUC5AC and MUC5Bexpression. Our study has demonstrated that only IL-6 and IL-17, not Th2 cytokines, can directly stimulate mucin gene expression in these primary human TBE cells. A similar observation was extended to primary TBE cells derived from monkey and mouse. Human tracheobronchial tissues were obtained from the University of California at Davis Medical Center (Sacramento, CA) by patient consent. The University Human Subjects Review Committee approved all procedures involved in tissue procurement. In this study, tissues were collected only from patients without diagnosed lung-related disease. Monkey tissues were obtained from the California Regional Primate Research Center at the University of California, Davis, CA. Transgenic mice were generated by the in-house transgenic animal facility. Primary cultures derived from these airway tissues have been established before (42Chen Y. Zhao Y.H. Wu R. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2001; 164: 1059-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Normally, tracheobronchial epithelial (TBE) cells were plated on a collagen gel substratum-coated Transwell™ (Corning Costar, Corning, NY) chamber (25 mm) at 1–2 × 104 cells/cm2, in a Ham's F12/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (1:1) supplemented with insulin (5 ॖg/ml), transferrin (5 ॖg/ml), epidermal growth factor (10 ng/ml), dexamethasone (0.1 ॖm), cholera toxin (10 ng/ml), bovine hypothalamus extract (15 ॖg/ml), bovine serum albumin (0.5 mg/ml), and all-trans-retinoic acid (30 nm). These primary TBE cultures, after a week in an immersed cultured condition, were transferred to an air-liquid interface (biphasic) culture condition. Under biphasic culture conditions, a mucociliary epithelium with the formation of cilia and mucus-secreting granules was observed (40Wu R. Zhao Y.H. Chang M.M. European Respir. J. 1997; 10: 2398-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Cytokines, IL-1α, 1औ, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, and TNFα were purchased from R&D systems Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). They were dissolved in phosphate-based saline with 17 bovine serum albumin and added directly to the primary TBE cultures at concentrations of 10 and 50 ng/ml. For additional dosage study (as indicated under “Results”), cytokine concentration was gradually increased up to 200 ng/ml. For the IL-6 neutralizing antibody study (R&D systems Inc. Minneapolis, MN), the antibody was added to culture at 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 ॖg/ml at the time of IL-17 treatment and its continuous presence was maintained until the time of harvest. For the inhibitor study, AG490, PD98059, U0126, and wortmannin were purchased fromCalbiochem-Novabiochem Corporation (San Diego, CA), and they were dissolved in Me2SO. The dose for each of these selected inhibitors was AG490 (5 ॖm), U0126 (1 ॖm), PD98059 (25 ॖm), and wortmannin (10 ॖm). Each dose was determined to be optimal in the initial literature search and the following experimental trials. RNA was isolated from the cultures by a single step phenol/chloroform extraction (43Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63169) Google Scholar). For Northern blot hybridization, an equal amount of total RNA (20 ॖg/lane) was subjected to electrophoresis on a 1.07 agarose gel in the presence of 2.2 mm formaldehyde and transblotted onto Nytran membranes as described above (44Chen Y. Zhao Y.H. Wu R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2001; 25: 409-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). For human and monkey cells, single-stranded antisense oligonucleotides corresponding to the tandem repeat unit of human MUC5B andMUC5AC, 5′-TGTGGTCAGCTTTGTGAGGATCCAGGTCGTCCCCGGAGTGGAGGAGGG-3′ (423–376 nt, GenBankTM: U63836) and 5′-AGGGGCAGAAGTTGTGCTGGTTGTGGGAGCAGAGGTTGTGCTGGTTGT-3′ (582–535 nt, GenBankTM: Z34277), respectively, were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase. For mouseMuc5b gene detection, the clone corresponding to the 3′-end sequence of mouse Muc5b (42Chen Y. Zhao Y.H. Wu R. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2001; 164: 1059-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by a ready-to-goTM random labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences). All blots were exposed overnight to a phosphor screen and read by the STORMTM system (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The relative abundance ofMUC5B/MUC5AC message in Northern blots was normalized with the 18 S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) band. PCR approach was carried out to examine MUC5AC andMUC5B gene expression. cDNAs were generated from the RNA mentioned above by oligo(dT) primer. MUC5AC andMUC5B gene-specific primers were designed according to sequences retrieved from GenBankTM. Specifically, forMUC5AC, forward primer (5′-ACCCAGATCTGCAACACACACT-3′) and reverse primer (5′- GAGCGAGTACATGGAAGAGCTG-3′) were designed based on MUC5AC sequence (AJ001403). For MUC5B, forward primer (5′-ACATGTGTACCTGCCTCTCTGG-3′) and reverse primer (5′-TCTGCTGAGTACTTGGACGCTC-3′) were designed based onMUC5B sequence (Y09788). Each PCR reaction contained 10 ॖm primers for a total volume of 50 ॖl of PCR reaction solution. The initial denaturing step was 94 °C for 2 min, and the last elongation step was 72 °C for 7 min. These PCR reactions were all carried out the same way: denaturing at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 45 s and extension (or polymerizing) at 72 °C for 1 min per cycle. Cycle number was determined by experiment with different dilutions of the cDNA samples to avoid saturation. Ultimately 25 cycles were chosen for the PCR. औ-actin band was used as an internal control. The PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on a 1.27 agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide post-staining. A chimeric construct containing the proximal 4169 bp of the human MUC5B promoter region (10Chen Y. Zhao Y.H. Di Y.P. Wu R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2001; 25: 542-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and a luciferase reporter gene was prepared using pGL-3 vector. Transgenic mice were generated using B6 mice from Targeted Genomics Laboratory (University of California, Davis). The transgenic positive mice were determined by Southern blot and RT-PCR. The expression profiles of the human MUC5B promoter-driven luciferase were consistent with mouse Muc5b gene expression in the mouse tissues. Two different founder mice were used for this study. For the luciferase assay, cell extracts were prepared from mouse TBE cultures and incubated with Luclite plusTM (Packard Instrument, Meriden, CT) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The relative luciferase activity was expressed with the total protein concentration after normalization. The results were averaged from triplicate dishes of two separate cultures derived from two different founder mice. A human IL-6 QuantikineTMELISA kit (R&D systems Inc. Minneapolis, MN) was used to measure the secreted IL-6 concentrations in both the apical and basal media of biphasic cultured cells following the manufacturer's instructions. Anti-human IL-6R antibody (R&D systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN) was used to characterize the expression of IL-6 receptors in these primary TBE cultures and various human tracheal tissue sections. The staining was carried out by using FITC-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories Inc. Burlingame, CA) and Vectashield mounting medium with propidium iodide (1.5 ॖg/ml), following the manufacturer's instructions. The staining pictures were captured by a digital camera attached to a Zeiss fluorescent microscope. Data are expressed as mean ± S.D. The number of repeats are described under “Results” and in the figure legends. Group differences were calculated by analysis of variance. When p < 0.01, the difference was considered significant. We treated primary tracheobronchial epithelial cells grown in an air liquid interface with a panel of cytokines (IL-1α, 1औ, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, and TNFα) for 24 h. As shown in Fig.1, our cytokine panel at 10 ng/ml showed that only IL-6 and IL-17 could induce a dramatic increase in expression of MUC5AC and MUC5B. The Th2 cytokines IL-4, IL-9, and IL-13 did not stimulate either MUC5AC orMUC5B. Treatment with a higher dose of 50 ng/ml yielded identical results (data not shown). MUC5B/5ACmRNA signals from three independent primary TBE cultures from different donors were normalized to 18 S rRNA signals and quantified. A 3–4-fold stimulation of both MUC5B and MUC5ACmessages was consistently observed after an overnight (16 h) treatment by IL-6 and IL-17 (Fig. 1, C and D). The effects of IL-6 and IL-17 on mucin gene expression were dose-dependent (Fig. 2,A and B). Concentrations as low as 2 ng/ml of IL-6 or 10 ng/ml of IL-17 elicited a significant stimulation ofMUC5B gene expression after 16 h of treatment on human primary TBE cultures. To ensure that our failure to find any induction by IL-4, IL-9, or IL-13 was not due to the generally lower sensitivity of northern blots (45McKenzie R.W. Jumblatt J.E. Jumblatt M.M. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 703-708PubMed Google Scholar), we repeated the experiments for them as well as IL-6 and IL-17 with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In addition, we used concentrations of up to 200 ng/ml to rule out that an inadequate cytokine concentration was a factor. As shown in Fig. 2B, even at 200 ng/ml, no effects onMUC5AC and MUC5B were detected in the IL-4, IL-9, or IL-13 treatments. In contrast, IL-6 showed a dose-dependent mucin-inducing activity at all concentrations up to 200 ng/ml, while IL-17 induced mucin genes at lower doses (10 and 50 ng/ml) but not at higher doses(100 and 200 ng/ml). The reason why lower levels of MUC5AC andMUC5B were seen at the higher concentrations of IL-17 is unclear. But it was apparently not due to toxicity because we routinely checked cell viability by the trypan blue dye exclusion test and found no evidence that higher levels of IL-17 were harmful to the cultures. For IL-4, IL-9, and IL-13, it was unlikely that a low level induction of MUC5AC or MUC5B occurred that could not be detected with the more sensitive RT-PCR (45McKenzie R.W. Jumblatt J.E. Jumblatt M.M. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 703-708PubMed Google Scholar). IL-2, 3, 5, 7, 8, and 18 appeared to have inhibited the expression of MUC5ACand MUC5B. These effects were not related to the cytotoxicity of the cytokines since the viability of the cells (greater than 957) was routinely checked by the trypan blue dye exclusion test with consistently positive results.Figure 2Dose- and time-dependent elevation ofMUC5B gene expression by cytokines. A, dose-dependent elevation of MUC5B message by IL-6 and IL-17, examined by Northern blot. IL-6 or IL-17 of various concentrations, as indicated, was used to treat primary human TBE cells overnight (16 h), as described in the legend to Fig. 1.B, IL-4, 6, 9, 13, 17 of various concentrations, as indicated, were used to treat primary human TBE cells overnight (16 h), as described in the legend to Fig. 1. Dose-dependent elevation of MUC5AC and MUC5B messages by IL-6 and IL-17 examined by RT-PCR. IL-17 had no induction at higher doses (100 ng/ml and 200 ng/ml). Notably, no inductions of MUC5Bmessage were seen in cultures treated with higher levels (up to 200 ng/ml) of IL-4, 9, and 13. C, time-dependent elevation of MUC5B message in monkey TBE cells after IL-6 (10 ng/ml) and IL-17 (10 ng/ml) treatments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A similar stimulation of MUC gene expression by these two cytokines was also seen in primary TBE cultures derived from monkey and mouse tissues (Figs. 2C and 4A, respectively). However, both animal cultures required a longer treatment time than human cells in order to see the stimulation by Northern blot analysis, which was probably related to the fact that human TBE cell culture has many mucous cells (goblet cell) while primary monkey and mouse TBE cell cultures have very few. 2R. Wu, Y. Chen, and Y. Zhao, unpublished observations. The significance of the stimulation by these two cytokines was further supported by the dramatic increase of the Alcian blue-PAS stained cell population in primary human TBE cultures (arrows in Fig.3, A–C), suggesting the elevation of mucous cell phenotypes in these cultures after IL-6 and IL-17 treatment. It is noteworthy to point out that throughout these studies, Th2 cytokine treatments had no stimulatory effect in these cultures (data not shown). In order to further clairfy the nature of mucin gene regulation, we looked into its transcriptional regulation. Because of the difficulty in transfecting well-differentiated primary human TBE cells, we examined the effects of IL-6 and IL-17 on primary cultures of mouse TBE cells derived from transgenic mice carrying multiple copies of aMUC5B promoter-luciferase reporter gene construct (10Chen Y. Zhao Y.H. Di Y.P. Wu R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2001; 25: 542-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). These cells essentially acted as “stable-transfected” cells. We grew mouse TBE cells from two independent transgenic lines in culture and treated each of these cultures with 10 ng/ml of IL-6 and IL-17. As shown in Fig. 4B, the background luciferase activity was very low in these TBE cultures, which was consistent with the observation that there are not many mucous cells in mouse TBE cell culture. One day after treatment with IL-6 and IL-17, there was a significant (1.6-fold) increase of the luciferase activity. This increase continued to 9- and 8-fold at day 3, and it reached 223- and 96-fold by day 7 after IL-6 and IL-17 treatments, respectively. These increases were also consistent with the Northern blot analysis of mouse Muc5b message in these cultures (Fig. 4A)."

https://openalex.org/W2044000724,"Histone acetyltransferases (HATs) are a group of enzymes that play a significant role in the regulation of gene expression. These enzymes covalently modify the N-terminal lysine residues of histones by the addition of acetyl groups from acetyl-CoA. Dysfunction of these enzymes is often associated with the manifestation of several diseases, predominantly cancer. Here we report that anacardic acid from cashew nut shell liquid is a potent inhibitor of p300 and p300/CBP-associated factor histone acetyltranferase activities.

The eukaryotic genome is organized as a highly complex nucleo-protein structure called chromatin, the unit of which is the nucleosome. The nucleosome is composed of two copies each of four different histones, H3, H2B, H2A, and H4, which is wrapped around by 146 base pairs of DNA. Therefore, for any process that requires access to the DNA (e.g. transcription, replication, recombination, and repair), the chromatin needs to be opened by the remodeling systems. There are two different biochemical processes to modify chromatin structure, namely the covalent modifications of histone tails and the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling. Among the several covalent modifications of histones known, the reversible acetylation of key lysine residues in histones holds a pivotal position in transcriptional regulation (1Roth S.Y. Denu J.M. Allis C.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 81-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1624) Google Scholar, 2Sterner D.E. Berger S.L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64, 2: 435-459Crossref Scopus (1412) Google Scholar). Acetylation of histones is a distinctive feature of the transcriptionally active genes, whereas deacetylation indicates the repressed state of a gene (1Roth S.Y. Denu J.M. Allis C.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 81-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1624) Google Scholar, 2Sterner D.E. Berger S.L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64, 2: 435-459Crossref Scopus (1412) Google Scholar). A balance between the acetylation and deacetylation states of histones regulates transcription. Dysfunction of the enzymes involved in these events, the histone acetyltransferases (HATs) 1The abbreviations used are: HAT, histone acetyltransferase; HDAC, histone deacetylase; PCAF, p300/CBP-associated factor; CBP, CREB-binding protein; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; AA, anacardic acid; CTPB, N-(4-chloro-3-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-2-ethoxy-6-pentadecyl-benzamide. and histone deacetylases (HDACs), is often associated with the manifestation of cancer (3Redner R.L. Wang J. Liu J.M. Blood. 1999; 94, 2: 417-428Crossref Google Scholar). These enzymes thus become potential new targets for antineoplastic therapy (4Marks P.A. Rifkind R.A. Richon V.M. Breslow R. Miller T. Kelly W.K. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 194-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (1693) Google Scholar). A wide repertoire of transcriptional co-activator proteins is now recognized to possess histone acetyltransferase activity (1Roth S.Y. Denu J.M. Allis C.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 81-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1624) Google Scholar, 2Sterner D.E. Berger S.L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64, 2: 435-459Crossref Scopus (1412) Google Scholar). These include p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF), which is similar to GCN5, nuclear hormone receptor cofactors such as steroid receptor cofactor 1 (SRC1) and activator of thyroid and retinoid receptor, and the multifunctional p300/CBP. The p300/CBP is a global transcriptional coactivator, which plays a critical role in a variety of cellular process including cell cycle control, differentiation, and apoptosis. Mutations in p300/CBP are associated with different human cancers and other human diseases (5Giles R.H. Peters D.J. Breuning M.H. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 178-183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 6Murata T. Kurokawa R. Krones A. Tatsumi K. Ishii M. Taki T. Masuno M. Ohashi H. Yanagisawa M.

It is one of the most potent histone acetyltransferases, which can acetylate all four-core histones within nucleosomes as well as free histone forms. The HAT activity of p300 is regulated by several other factors. For example, the viral oncoprotein E1A binds to p300 and inhibits its activity, whereas phosphorylation of CBP by cyclin E/Cdk2 kinase activates its HAT activity (7Ait-Si-Ali S. Ramirez S. Barre F.X. Dkhissi F. Magnaghi-Jaulin L Girault J.A. Robin P. Knibiehler M. Pritchard L.L. Ducommun B. Trouche D. Harel-Bellan A. Nature. 1998; 396: 184-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). During the process of transcription, p300 is recruited on to the chromatin template through the direct interaction with the activator and enhances the transcription by acetylation of promoter proximal nucleosomal histones (8Kundu T.K. Palhan V. Wang Z. An W. Cole P.A. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 551-561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Although significant progress has been made in the field of histone deacetylase inhibitors as antineoplastic therapeutics, and some of the compounds are already in human trials (4Marks P.A. Rifkind R.A. Richon V.M. Breslow R. Miller T. Kelly W.K. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 194-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (1693) Google Scholar), the reports of HAT inhibitors/activators are scanty. Prior to the molecular characterization of HAT enzymes, several polyamine-CoA conjugates were found to block HAT activity in cell extracts. However, the target enzyme(s) for these conjugates was not known (9Cullis P.M. Wolfeuden R. Cousens L. Alberts B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12165-12169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, two peptide-CoA conjugates, namely Lysyl CoA (Lys-CoA) and H3-CoA-20, were synthesized that specifically inhibit the HAT activity of p300 and PCAF, respectively (10Lau O.D. Kundu T.K. Soccio R.E. Ait-Si-Ali S. Khalil E.M. Vassilev A. Wolfe A.P. Nakatani Y. Roeder R.G. Cole P.A. Mol. Cell. 2000; : 589-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Costanzo A. Merlo P.

Here we report that a small molecule compound anacardic acid from cashew nut shell liquid, known to have antitumor activity (12Kubo I. Ochi M. Vieira P.C. Komatsu S. J. Agric. Food Chem. 1993; 41: 1012-1015Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar), inhibits HAT activity of p300 and PCAF. Surprisingly, the amide derivative of the same compound shows an enhancement of p300 HAT activity with human core histones and positive transcriptional coactivator, PC4, as substrates. Furthermore, since this compound does not induce the HAT activity of PCAF, it is p300-specific. It had no effect in HDAC1 activity. As expected, it enhanced the HAT-dependent transcriptional activation from chromatin template but did not show any effect on in vitro DNA transcription. This selective activator should be a very useful biological tool to understand the mechanisms of p300 function and may also introduce a novel group of compounds for antineoplastic therapeutics. Purification of Human Core Histones and Recombinant Proteins— Human core histones were purified from HeLa nuclear pellet as described previously (13Kundu T.K. Wang Z. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1605-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The FLAG epitope-tagged human topoisomerase I, histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), and PCAF were purified from the recombinant baculovirus-infected insect cell line, Sf21, by immunoaffinity purification using M2-agarose (Sigma) (14Wang Z. Roeder R.G. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1315-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Full-length p300 was also purified from the recombinant baculovirus-infected Sf21 cells as a His6-tagged protein through the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity column (Qiagen) as described previously (13Kundu T.K. Wang Z. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1605-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The His6-tagged nucleosome assembly protein 1 (NAP1) used for the in vitro chromatin assembly was purified from Escherichia coli cells as reported previously (13Kundu T.K. Wang Z. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1605-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and the FLAG-tagged chimeric activator Gal4-VP16 was expressed in E. coli and purified by immunoaffinity purification with M2 agarose. Human positive transcriptional coactivator, PC4, was expressed in E. coli and purified as described earlier (15Prashanth Kumar B.R. Swaminathan V Banerjee S. Kundu T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16804-16809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The peptide substrate, a 45-residue core histone H3 N-terminal peptide (N-CARTKQTARKSTGGKAPRQLASKAARKSAPSTGGVKKPHRYKPG-C), was synthesized and purified (by high performance liquid chromatography) in the Peptide Research Laboratory, Cancer Research, London, UK. Synthesis of N-(4-Chloro-3-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-2-ethoxy-6-pentadecyl-benzamide (CTPB) (6Murata T. Kurokawa R. Krones A. Tatsumi K. Ishii M. Taki T. Masuno M. Ohashi H. Yanagisawa M.

Rev. 2000; 64, 2: 435-459Crossref Scopus (1412) Google Scholar)—Anacardic acid 2 (molecular weight, 348) was treated with diethyl sulfate (16Kiong L.S. Tyman J.H.P. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1. 1981; : 1942-1952Crossref Google Scholar) in the presence of K2CO3 in acetone, which yielded diethyl ester 3. Diethyl ester on treatment with potassium t-butoxide (17Chang F.C. Wood N.F. Tetrahedron Lett. 1964; : 2969-2973Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar) in Me2SO yielded O-ethyl anacardic acid 4. The compound 4 on treatment with thionyl chloride in the presence of a catalytic amount of N,N-dimethylformamide yielded the corresponding acid chloride 5. The resultant acid chloride was taken for a condensation step without further purification. Compound 5 was condensed with 5-amino-2-chloro benzenetriflouride in dichloromethane in the presence of triethylamine as acid scavenger to yield compound (CTPB) 6 (molecular weight, 554) (see Fig. 3A). The formation of the derivatives was confirmed by IR and NMR spectroscopy (data not shown). X-ray Structure Determination of CTPB—Good quality, needle-shaped crystals of the CTPB (0.1 mm, 0.055 g), grown from a mixture of hexane and dichloromethane (2:1) by slow evaporation at room temperature, were chosen after examination under an optical microscope and coated with epoxy before mounting. X-ray diffraction intensities were measured by ω scans using a Siemens three-circle diffractometer attached with a CCD area detector and a graphite monochromator for the MoKα radiation (50 kV, 40 mA). A hemisphere of reciprocal space was collected using the SMART software with 2θ setting of the detector at 28°. Data reduction was performed using the SAINT program (Siemens). The phase problem was solved by direct methods, and the non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically, by means of the full matrix least-squares procedure using the SHELXTL program (Siemens). All the hydrogen atoms were located using the difference Fourier method. The absolute structure of CTPB is shown in Fig. 3B. HAT Assay—HAT assays were performed as described elsewhere (13Kundu T.K. Wang Z. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1605-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Briefly, indicated amounts of proteins/peptide (see the figure legends) were incubated in HAT assay buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethyl sulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 10 mm sodium butyrate at 30 °C for 10 min in the presence or absence of compound followed by the addition of 1 μl of 6.2 Ci/mmol [3H]acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) and were further incubated for another 10 min. The final reaction volume was 30 μl. The reaction mixture was then blotted onto P-81 (Whatman) filter papers, and radioactive counts were recorded on a Wallac 1409 liquid scintillation counter. To characterize the inhibition kinetics of anacardic acid, filter binding assays were done using a constant amount of HeLa core histones in the presence or absence of AA with increasing concentrations of [3H]acetyl-CoA (see the legend for Fig. 2). To visualize the radiolabeled acetylated histones, the reaction mixtures were resolved on 15% SDS-PAGE and processed for fluorography as described elsewhere (15Prashanth Kumar B.R. Swaminathan V Banerjee S. Kundu T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16804-16809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Histone Deacetylase Assay—Deacetylation assays were performed in the HAT assay buffer without sodium butyrate. 2 μg of core histones was incubated with 20 ng of p300 and 1 μl of 6.2 Ci/mmol [3H]acetyl-CoA for 15 min at 30 °C. The activity of p300 was inhibited by incubating the reaction mixture with 10 nm p300-HAT-specific inhibitor, Lysyl-CoA (10Lau O.D. Kundu T.K. Soccio R.E. Ait-Si-Ali S. Khalil E.M. Vassilev A. Wolfe A.P. Nakatani Y. Roeder R.G. Cole P.A. Mol.

The samples were analyzed by fluorography. In Vitro Chromatin Assembly—A chromatin template for in vitro transcription experiments was assembled and characterized as described earlier (8Kundu T.K. Palhan V. Wang Z. An W. Cole P.A. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 551-561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) In Vitro Transcription Assay—Transcription assays were essentially carried out as described elsewhere (8Kundu T.K. Palhan V. Wang Z. An W. Cole P.A. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 551-561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The scheme of transcription is enumerated in Fig. 5A. Briefly, 30 ng of DNA/equivalent amount of chromatin template was incubated with 30 ng of activator (Gal4-VP16) in a buffer containing 4 mm HEPES (pH 7.8), 20 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm sodium butyrate, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2% glycerol (8Kundu T.K. Palhan V. Wang Z. An W. Cole P.A. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 551-561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The compound CTPB was added to the acetylation reaction along with p300 and acetyl-CoA and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. This was followed by addition of the p300-specific inhibitor Lysyl CoA (5 μm) to quench the acetylation reaction (see “Results and Discussion”). For AA, the HAT p300 was preincubated with indicated amounts of AA on ice for 20 min, following which it was added to the acetylation reaction in the transcription assay (see Fig. 5A, scheme). For the DNA transcription assays and chromatin transcription inhibition assays, the Lysyl CoA step was omitted. After acetylation, HeLa nuclear extract (5 μl, which contains ∼8 mg/ml protein) was added to initiate the preinitiation complex formation. Transcription reaction was started by the addition of NTP-mix and α-[32P]UTP after the preinitiation complex formation. The incubation was continued for 40 min at 30 °C. Transcription was terminated by the addition of 250 μl of stop buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 1% SDS, and 0.025 ng/μl tRNA). The 32P-radiolabeled transcript was extracted with phenol-chloroform, ethanol-precipitated, dried pellet-dissolved in loading dye (8 m urea, 0.005% bromphenol blue, and xylene cyanol), and analyzed on 5% urea-polyacrylamide gel. Gels were then dried and subjected to autoradiography at -70 °C. Quantification of transcription was done by Fuji BAS system. Quantitation of DNA and chromatin transcription data represents three independent experiments. There are several reports on the inhibitors of histone deacetylases (HDAC), whereas those regarding HAT inhibitors are scanty. Recently, two enzyme-specific HAT inhibitors have been synthesized that are peptide conjugates of acetyl-CoA, Lys-CoA for p300 and H3-CoA-20 for PCAF (10Lau O.D. Kundu T.K. Soccio R.E. Ait-Si-Ali S. Khalil E.M. Vassilev A. Wolfe A.P. Nakatani Y. Roeder R.G. Cole P.A. Mol. Cell. 2000; : 589-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, there is no report yet regarding naturally occurring inhibitors of any of the HATs. We have screened the plant extracts known to possess anticancer properties. The extracts (both polar and nonpolar) were tested for their HAT inhibitory activity in filter binding assays (see “Experimental Procedures”) using highly purified HeLa core histones (Fig. 1A) as a substrate- and baculovirus-expressed PCAF or p300, as the histone acetyltransferases (Fig. 1, C and D). This led us to find out that cashew nut shell liquid possessed inhibitory activity toward p300. The systematic bioactivity-guided fractionation of cashew nut shell liquid yielded an unsaturated anacardic acid mixture, namely the 8′Z-monoene, the 8′Z, 11′Z-diene, and the 8′Z, 11′Z, 14′Z-triene, which are the chief constituents (∼75%) of cashew nut-shell liquid (18Shobha S.V. Ravindranath B. J. Agric. Food Chem. 1991; 39: 2214-2217Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar), having maximum HAT inhibitory activity (data not shown). The hydrogenation of the unsaturated anacardic acids mixture yielded a single compound, anacardic acid (2-hydroxy-6-pentadecylbenzoic acid), showing an equally potent inhibitory activity toward p300 (Fig. 2A). These data indicated that the absence of unsaturation in anacardic acid did not alter its HAT inhibitory property. To further test the specificity and concentration dependence of inhibition, we compared the effect of a range of concentrations of anacardic acid on the HAT activities of p300 and PCAF. Since the compound was in Me2SO, we added an appropriate control in the HAT assays. The solvent does not produce any appreciable change in the HAT activities of either p300 or PCAF (Fig. 2A, bar 3 versus bar 2). Although at 5 μm concentration of anacardic acid, p300 showed a minimal enhancement in HAT activity, the same concentration of anacardic acid with PCAF showed an inhibition of 50% (Fig. 2A, bar 4 versus bar 3, see inset). Further increase in the concentration of anacardic acid produced a rapid inhibition of HAT activities of both p300 and PCAF, with 15 μm anacardic acid quenching HAT activity >90% (Fig. 2A, bar 6 versus bar 3). To visualize the anacardic acid-mediated inhibition of p300 HAT activity on different core histones, we analyzed the radiolabeled histones on SDS-PAGE followed by fluorography. The results were similar to the observation made in the filter binding assays. In the presence of 5 μm anacardic acid, there is an increase in the acetylation of histone H4 (Fig. 2B, lane 4). However, the overall acetylation remains the same as compared with acetylation in absence of the inhibitor. Further increase in the concentration of anacardic acid completely quenches the HAT activity (Fig. 2B, lane 7). The gel assay for PCAF shows a correlation with the filter binding assay (Fig. 2C), with higher concentrations of anacardic acid completely shutting off HAT activity (Fig. 2C, lane 7). The IC50 values of anacardic acid for p300 and PCAF were found to be ∼8.5 μm (data not shown) and ∼5 μm (Fig. 2A, bar 4), respectively. The filter binding assays were also repeated, using the human histone H3 N-terminal peptide as the substrate for p300 HAT to confirm the specificity of AA toward the HAT. Addition of AA to the reaction produced the characteristic inhibition of HAT activity (Fig. 2D), and the IC50 value for H3 peptide was found to be ∼500 nm (Fig. 2D, bar 7 versus bar 3). We went on to characterize the nature of inhibition of anacardic acid on the p300 HAT activity. The rate of the acetylation reaction at different concentrations of the inhibitors (and in its absence) was recorded with increasing concentrations of [3H]acetyl-CoA and a constant amount of core histones. The double reciprocal plot for each inhibitor concentration and in its absence (1/cpm versus 1/[acetyl-CoA]) was plotted as shown in Fig. 2E. The results suggest that AA is a non-competitive type of p300-HAT inhibitor. Due to the apparent lack of specificity toward HATs, we were interested in altering the various functional groups of anacardic acid, keeping the parent structure intact, to end up with a molecule with a better inhibitory effect or even selectivity. Since the side chain of the compound had already been negated from having any effect (no change in the HAT inhibition of unsaturated versus saturated anacardic acid), we modified the other functional groups on the phenolic ring in anacardic acid. The acidic group on the anacardic acid was modified to different amide derivatives using substituted anilides (“Experimental Procedures”). One of these compounds, with a 5-amino-2-chlorobenzotrifluoride moiety substituted on anacardic acid, CTPB (Fig. 3, A and B), when tested in an in vitro HAT assay (filter binding), surprisingly showed an enhancement in the p300 HAT activity while keeping the PCAF HAT activity mostly unperturbed (Fig. 4A). The concentration-dependent HAT activity profile revealed a maximum for p300 HAT activity at 275 μm CTPB (Fig. 4A, inset, bar 7c), an ∼4-fold increase over the Me2SO control (Fig. 4A, inset, lane 7c versus lane 3). Further increase in the concentration of CTPB to 300 μm resulted in a drop in the activation levels. These results were confirmed using the H3 peptide as a substrate in the HAT assays with p300 (data not shown). To analyze the effect of the compound on the acetylation of the individual core histones, the radiolabeled products of the HAT assays were separated on a 15% SDS-PAGE and visualized by fluorography. Addition of CTPB in increasing amounts in the presence of p300 resulted in the gradual increase in the acetylation of both histones H3 and H4, peaking at 200 μm (Fig. 4B, lane 7). In contrast to the filter binding assays, the enhancement in the gel assays is ∼5-fold more than the Me2SO control (Fig. 4B, lane 7 versus lane 3). Further increase in the concentration of CTPB brings down the HAT activity. A drop in the enhancement of HAT activity at higher concentrations of the activator, CTPB, a nonpolar compound, could be due to an alteration in the reaction condition affecting the efficiency of the HAT. In case of PCAF, there is a slight increase in the levels of H4 acetylation, whereas the H3 acetylation levels remain constant (Fig. 4C). This reflects the congruence between the filter binding and gel assay data. Despite using highly purified p300 and PCAF for our HAT assays, we went on to check the effect of CTPB on histone deacetylases, enzymes that catalyze the reverse reaction of HATs. This was done to ensure that CTPB does not affect other enzymes or the substrate (histones) in a nonspecific manner. The HDAC assays protocol was modified (as elaborated under “Experimental Procedures”) to include acetylation of histones followed by the quenching of the HAT activity by the p300-selective HAT inhibitor, Lys-CoA, and the incubation with the purified recombinant human HDAC1 (Fig. 1B), either in the presence or in the absence of CTPB. Deacetylation of the core histones in the presence or absence of the compound, CTPB at 100 or 500 μm, shows no difference whatsoever (Fig. 4D, lanes 5 and 6 versus lane 3). Preincubation of HDAC1 with CTPB does not affect its deacetylation activity (data not shown). Interestingly, addition of CTPB, after quenching the p300 HAT activity by Lys-CoA, does not show the characteristic enhancement (Fig. 4D, lane 7 versus lane 2). Addition of the solvent, Me2SO, has a slight inhibitory effect on the deacetylase activity of HDAC1 (Fig. 4D, lane 4 versus lane 3). These results indicate the specific nature of CTPB toward p300. To confirm that the target of CTPB is p300, we have used a nonhistone substrate, human transcription coactivator PC4, for p300 acetylation. PC4 is acetylated specifically by p300 (16Kiong L.S. Tyman J.H.P. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1. 1981; : 1942-1952Crossref Google Scholar). The addition of CTPB (100 μm) enhances PC4 acetylation by p300 (Fig. 4E, lane 5 versus lane 3) substantially. A further increase in the concentration of CTPB produces a drop in the enhancement of PC4 acetylation (data not shown), as observed in the case of the histones. Taken together, these results indicate that the probable target of CTPB is the enzyme p300. p300, along with its homologue CBP, is known to be a prominent transcription coactivator, capable of interacting with a large number of transcriptional activators possessing HAT activity. Acetylation of histones is a distinctive feature of active genes (19Allfrey V. Faulkner R.M. Mirsky. A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1964; 51: 786-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (1787) Google Scholar). It has been conclusively proved that the acetylation of the promoter proximal histones by p300 is necessary and sufficient for the initiation of transcription. Thus, modulators of the HAT activity of p300 can be applied in the study of transcriptional regulation. To address the effect of CTPB on transcription from a chromatin template, we used the in vitro chromatin-based transcription system (8Kundu T.K. Palhan V. Wang Z. An W. Cole P.A. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 551-561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). This system requires the HAT activity of p300 for the initiation of transcription (Fig. 5A). Such a system would be ideal for testing CTPB. To establish the HAT-specific nature of our compound, we first tested its effect on transcription from a histone-free DNA template. This system does not require p300 HAT activity for transcriptional initiation (Fig. 5B). Addition of the solvent, Me2SO, to this assay produces a drop in transcript levels (Fig. 5B, lane 3 versus lane 2). However, the addition of increasing concentration of either AA or CTPB does not produce any variation in the transcript levels as compared with the Me2SO control (Fig. 5B, lanes 4–7 for AA and lanes 8–10 for CTPB versus lane 3, and see also the legend for Fig. 5). This suggests that the compounds do not affect any component of the basal transcription machinery. The drop in transcript levels upon addition of Me2SO may be due to the disruption of certain key protein-protein interactions. We went on to test the effect of the compound CTPB on HAT-dependent transcription from a chromatin template. The template pG5ML-array (8Kundu T.K. Palhan V. Wang Z. An W. Cole P.A. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 551-561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) was assembled into chromatin by using the NAP1-mediated assembly method (“Experimental Procedures”). Addition of CTPB to the HAT-dependent transcription reaction along with the p300 and acetyl-CoA (without addition of Lys-CoA) did not produce a significant variation in the transcript levels with or without the compound (data not shown). A close scrutiny of the transcription assay scheme revealed that the HAT activity of p300 remains active throughout the assay period, within which time the promoter proximal histones could be completely acetylated. To characterize a HAT activator, it would be necessary to limit the period of acetylation to a small window. We achieved this by adding the p300-specific inhibitor Lys-CoA (10Lau O.D. Kundu T.K. Soccio R.E. Ait-Si-Ali S. Khalil E.M. Vassilev A. Wolfe A.P. Nakatani Y. Roeder R.G. Cole P.A. Mol. Cell. 2000; : 589-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) after allowing for 30 min of acetylation either in the presence or in the absence of the compound. Under these conditions, we found that the addition of Me2SO produced a slight drop in the transcript levels (Fig. 5C, lane 5 versus lane 4), whereas the addition of CTPB enhanced the levels of transcription 1.6-fold over the Me2SO control (Fig. 5C, lane 6 versus lane 5). Thus, this result indicates that CTPB specifically enhances the HAT activity of p300, a function that is reflected even at the transcriptional level. To explain the 1.6-fold increase in transcription levels, in contrast to the ∼5-fold increase in the histone acetylation levels, we carried out a time course experiment to analyze the effect of CTPB on histone acetylation over a 30-min time period. We used Me2SO-treated p300 acetylation reactions as the control on which the activation levels were calculated (Fig. 5D). Since the histone concentration remains constant, the difference in the levels of histone acetylation drops over time. After a 30-min incubation, the difference stands at 1.6-fold (Fig. 5D, bar 4), the same as what we observe in the transcription assay. Anacardic acid did not affect the transcription from the DNA template, but the HAT-dependent transcription from chromatin template was inhibited by anacardic acid even at 10 μm concentration (Fig. 5C, lane 10 versus lane 9). We have identified a natural compound that can broadly inhibit the HAT activity but not any other enzymatic activity as revealed by the DNA transcription. Although anacardic acid is not specific for any particular group of HATs, it may serve as a lead compound to synthesize other non-peptide-based specific HAT activity modulators. The most significant finding of this study is the synthesis of a specific activator of p300 HAT activity, CTPB, using anacardic acid as a synthon. The enhancement of p300 HAT activity by CTPB is also reflected at the transcriptional level, where acetylation of histones in the promoter proximal region dictates transcription initiation. Further investigation of the effect of CTPB on in vivo histone acetylation and the functions thereof should be studied to understand the mechanism of action of the compound. This information would be very useful to design a novel group of antineoplastic drugs targeted toward histone acetyltransferases. We thank Drs. Robert G. Roeder, Philip A. Cole, James T. Kadonaga, and Alain Verreault for providing invaluable reagents. We thank Profs. C. N. R. Rao and G. U. Kulkarni for providing facilities for synthesis and x-ray crystal analysis of the compound.

To identify drugs that prevent inflammation, we screened inhibitors of TAK1 catalytic activity. We identified a natural resorcylic lactone of fungal origin, 5Z-7-oxozeaenol, as a highly potent inhibitor of TAK1. This compound did not effectively inhibit the catalytic activities of the MEKK1 or ASK1 MAPKKKs, suggesting that 5Z-7-oxozeaenol is a selective inhibitor of TAK1. In cell culture, 5Z-7-oxozeaenol blocked interleukin-1-induced activation of TAK1, JNK/p38 MAPK, IκB kinases, and NF-κB, resulting in inhibition of cyclooxgenase-2 production. Furthermore, in vivo 5Z-7-oxozeaenol was able to inhibit picryl chloride-induced ear swelling. Thus, 5Z-7-oxozeaenol blocks proinflammatory signaling by selectively inhibiting TAK1 MAPKKK.

We have recently demonstrated that TAK1 also activates IκB kinases (IKKs), ultimately leading to activation of the transcription factor NF-κB (4Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishimoto K. Hiyama A. Inoue J. Cao Z. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 398: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar). TAK1 participates in proinflammatory cellular signaling pathways such as the interleukin-1 (IL-1) pathway by activating both JNK/p38 MAPKs and IKKs. Exposure of cells to IL-1 induces the interaction between endogenous TAK1 and TRAF6 (tumor necrosis factor (TNF)receptor-associated factor6), a molecule essential for IL-1 activation of both JNK/p38 and NF-κB. This interaction in turn leads to TAK1 activation. We have previously identified two TAK1-binding proteins, TAB1 and TAB2 (5Shibuya H. Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Tonegawa A. Gotoh Y. Ueno N. Irie K.

When ectopically co-expressed, TAB1 augments the kinase activity of TAK1, indicating that TAB1 functions as an activator of TAK1 (5Shibuya H. Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Tonegawa A. Gotoh Y. Ueno N.

TAB2 functions as an adaptor linking TAK1 to TRAF6 by directly binding to both, thereby mediating TAK1 activation in the IL-1 signaling pathway (6Takaesu G. Kishida S. Hiyama A. Yamaguchi K.

Several lines of evidence suggest that TAK1 is a key molecule in proinflammatory signaling pathways. Various proinflammatory cytokines and endotoxins activate the kinase activity of endogenous TAK1 (4Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishimoto K. Hiyama A. Inoue J. Cao Z. Matsumoto K.

The Drosophila homolog of TAK1 was recently identified as an essential molecule for host defense signaling in Drosophila(11Vidal S. Khush R.S. Leulier F. Tzou P. Nakamura M. Lemaitre B. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1900-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the TAK1 gene-silencing study using the small interfering RNA method defined that TAK1 is essential for both IL-1- and TNF-induced NF-κB activation in mammalian cells (12Takaesu G. Surabhi R.M. Park K.J. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. Gaynor R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Therefore, it can be expected that inhibition of TAK1 activity may be effective in preventing inflammation and tissue destruction promoted by proinflammatory cytokines. In this study, we screened for compounds that can inhibit TAK1 kinase activity. This strategy resulted in the isolation of one natural compound 5Z-7-oxozeaenol, a resorcylic lactone of fungal origin. We found that 5Z-7-oxozeaenol inhibited the kinase activity of purified TAK1, whereas no significant inhibition of TAK1 activity was observed with structurally related compounds including radicicol. 5Z-7-Oxozeaenol had no significant effect on the kinase activities of other members of the MAPKKK family such as MEKK1 and ASK1. Exposure of cells to 5Z-7-oxozeaenol blocked IL-1-induced activation of TAK1, IKK, JNK, p38, and NF-κB. Furthermore, 5Z-7-oxozeaenol inhibited IL-1-induced production of cyclooxygenase-2 and relieved ear swelling induced by picryl chloride. These results suggest that 5Z-7-oxozeaenol blocks proinflammatory signaling by selectively inhibiting TAK1 MAPKKK. Zeaenol analog and radicicol were prepared from the culture broth of fungal strain f6024 and f6065, respectively.

For the transfection studies, cells (1 × 106) were plated in 10-cm dishes, transfected with a total of 10 μg of DNA containing various expression vectors by the calcium phosphate precipitate method, and incubated for 24–36 h before stimulation. Cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 0.3 ml of 0.5% Triton X-100 lysis buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 12.5 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20 μm aprotinin. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 5 min. Proteins from cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with 1 μg of various antibodies and 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). The immune complexes were washed three times with wash buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 500 mm NaCl, and 10 mmMgCl2, and once with rinse buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 10 mm MgCl2 and suspended in 30 μl of rinse buffer. For immunoblotting, the immunoprecipitates or whole cell lysates were resolved on SDS-PAGE and transferred to Hybond-P membranes (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were immunoblotted with various antibodies, and the bound antibodies were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies against rabbit or mouse IgG using the ECL Western blotting system (Amersham Biosciences). For screening TAK1 inhibitors, insect expression vectors for TAK1 and TAB1 were co-infected into Sf9 cells. After 2 days of incubation, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-TAK1 antibody (M-17). The immunoprecipitates were incubated with various compounds and subsequently incubated with 2 μg of myelin basic protein and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol) in 10 μl of the kinase buffer containing 10 mmHEPES (pH 7.4), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mmMgCl2 at 30 °C for 5 min. Samples were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and 32P incorporated into myelin basic protein was quantified with a bioimage analyzer (FUJIX BAS2000). The catalytic activity of MEK1 was determined by activation of ERK2 (Upstate Biotechnology) to phosphorylate myelin basic protein according to the manufacturer's procedure. The catalytic activity of MEKK1 was measured with 2 μg of myelin basic protein as a substrate in the kinase buffer. For subsequent kinase assays, immunoprecipitates were incubated with 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol) and 1 μg of bacterially expressed MKK6 or GST-IκBα-(1–72) in 10 μl of the kinase buffer at 25 °C for 2 min. Samples were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. Assays for reporter gene activity were performed as described (4Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishimoto K. Hiyama A. Inoue J. Cao Z. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 398: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar). An Ig-κ-luciferase reporter was used to measure NF-κB-dependent transcription. A plasmid containing the β-galactosidase gene under the control of the β-actin promoter (pAct-β-galactosidase) was used for normalizing transfection efficiency. Female BALB/c mice (6 weeks old) were sensitized by applying 0.1 ml of picryl chloride (50 mg/ml) in an olive oil/acetone solution (1:5, v/v) to the shaved abdomen of the mice at day 0. Seven days later, 10 μl of picryl chloride solution (10 mg/ml) in olive oil was applied to each side of the right ear (PC challenge). At day 10, mice were resensitized with picryl chloride. At day 17, the PC challenge was repeated (second PC challenge). Ten μl of 1 mg/ml 5Z-7-oxozeaenol or vehicle alone (ethanol) were painted on each side of the right ear before and after the second PC challenge. The ear thickness was measured with calibrated digital thickness gauges before and 24 h after the second PC challenge, and the difference in thickness was calculated. We have previously shown that TAK1 has no kinase activity when expressed alone but is activated when TAB1 is co-expressed (5Shibuya H. Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Tonegawa A. Gotoh Y. Ueno N. Irie K. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1996; 272: 1179-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 7Kishimoto K. Matsumoto K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7359-7364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). To identify inhibitors of TAK1, we developed an in vitro kinase assay system using purified TAK1 and TAB1 proteins expressed in insect cells. We tested 90 compounds, including 59 compounds that have been reported to inhibit protein kinases, 24 oxindole-related compounds, and 7 resorcylic acid lactone-related compounds. Of these compounds, one resorcylic acid lactone-related compound, 5Z-7-oxozeaenol, was found to be a very potent inhibitor of TAK1, with an IC50 of 8 nm (Fig.1A and TableI). Other structurally related compounds such as radicicol had little inhibitory activity, with an IC50 of >10 μm. The remaining 89 compounds did not exhibit any effective inhibition of TAK1. These included oxindole protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (SU5402 and SU4984), staurosporine-related protein kinase C inhibitors, the platelet-derived growth factor receptor inhibitor AG1433, and the plant flavonoid apigenin. Two compounds, Ro092210 and L783277, with very similar structures to 5Z-7-oxozeaenol were previously demonstrated to inhibit MEK kinase activity (17Williams D.H. Wilkinson S.E. Purton T. Lamont A. Flotow H. Murray E.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9579-9585Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 18Zhao A. Lee S.H. Mojena M. Jenkins R.G. Patrick D.R. Huber H.E. Goetz M.A. Hensens O.D. Zink D.L. Vilella D. Dombrowski A.W. Lingham R.B. Huang L. J. Antibiot. 1999; 52: 1086-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). We examined the effect of 5Z-7-oxozeaenol on purified rat MEK1 kinase activity (Fig.1B). 5Z-7-Oxozeaenol did inhibit MEK1 kinase activity; however, the IC50 of 5Z-7-oxozeaenol required to inhibit MEK1 is 411 nm, which is 50-fold higher than that for TAK1.Table IInhibitory activity of compounds on TAK1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)* IC50 values are means from two or three independent experiments (n = 3). Open table in a new tab * IC50 values are means from two or three independent experiments (n = 3). To explore the mechanism for 5Z-7-oxozeaenol inhibition of TAK1, we examined whether 5Z-7-oxozeaenol is competitive with ATP. We incubated increasing concentrations of ATP and 5Z-7-oxozeaenol with purified TAK1 and subsequently assayed kinase activity of TAK1. We found that the IC50 of 5Z-7-oxozeaenol required to inhibit TAK1 shifted to higher values with increasing ATP concentrations (Fig. 1D), suggesting that 5Z-7-oxozeaenol is a competitive inhibitor of ATP binding to TAK1. When 5Z-7-oxozeaenol was preincubated with TAK1 for 30 min before the addition of ATP, the IC50 values of 5Z-7-oxozeaenol did not shift with increasing ATP concentrations (Fig. 1D), suggesting that the binding of 5Z-7-oxozeaenol to TAK1 is either irreversible or very slowly reversible. Thus, 5Z-7-oxozeaenol is likely to irreversibly interact within the ATP binding site of TAK1, thereby inhibiting the catalytic activity of TAK1. To evaluate whether 5Z-7-oxozeaenol is a specific inhibitor of TAK1 or if it more generally inhibits the MAPKKK family, we tested the effect of 5Z-7-oxozeaenol on bacterially expressed MEKK1 kinase activity in vitro (Fig.1C). 5Z-7-Oxozeaenol had a weak effect on MEKK1 kinase activity. The IC50 of 5Z-7-oxozeaenol required to inhibit MEKK1 was 268 nm. To further verify the effects of 5Z-7-oxozeaenol on MAPKKKs, we utilized ectopically expressed MAPKKKs in 293 cells. TAK1 is known to be active when it is co-expressed together with TAB1 (5Shibuya H. Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Tonegawa A. Gotoh Y. Ueno N. Irie K. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1996; 272: 1179-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 7Kishimoto K. Matsumoto K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7359-7364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). When N-terminal truncated MEKK1 (MEKK1ΔN) or the full-length ASK1 is overexpressed in 293 cells, they are catalytically active (19Ichijo H. Nishida E. Irie K. ten Dijke P. Saitoh M. Moriguchi T. Takagi M. Matsumoto K. Miyazono K. Gotoh Y. Science. 1997; 275: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (2037) Google Scholar, 20Yan M. Dai T. Deak J.C. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Woodgett J.R. Templeton D.J. Nature. 1994; 372: 798-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). FLAG-tagged TAK1 together with TAB1, FLAG-MEKK1ΔN, or FLAG-ASK1 was expressed in 293 cells, and each kinase was immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody. We measured their abilities both to autophosphorylate themselves and to phosphorylate MAPKK MKK6 (Fig. 2). In this assay, 5Z-7-oxozeaenol inhibited autophosphorylation of TAK1 and TAK1 activity to phosphorylate MKK6 at concentrations of 30–300 nm. By contrast, no inhibitory effect of 5Z-7-oxozeaenol was observed on MEKK1 or ASK1. The kinase activity of another MAPKKK, MEKK4, was also not inhibited by 5Z-7-oxozeaenol at concentrations as high as 500 nm (data not shown). Thus, 5Z-7-oxozeaenol is potent and selective inhibitor of TAK1. We have previously demonstrated that TAK1 is involved in the IL-1 signaling pathway (4Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishimoto K. Hiyama A. Inoue J. Cao Z. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 398: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar). The observation that 5Z-7-oxozeaenol inhibits TAK1 activity raised the possibility that this compound might be an effective inhibitor of IL-1 signaling. Treatment of cells with IL-1 activates endogenous TAK1 activity and consequently stimulates the MAPK cascade and IKK, leading to the activation of JNK/p38 MAPKs and NF-κB, respectively. To verify if 5Z-7-oxozeaenol can inhibit IL-1 signaling, we test for the effect of 5Z-7-oxozeaenol on NF-κB-dependent transcriptional activation induced by IL-1 (Fig.3A). We found that treatment of cells with 5Z-7-oxozeaenol effectively inhibited IL-1-induced activation of NF-κB. NF-κB is activated through several pathways including human T-cell leukemia virus Tax protein and TNF pathways. TAK1 is implicated in TNF-induced NF-κB activation (10Sakurai H. Miyoshi H. Toriumi W. Sugita T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10641-10648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 12Takaesu G. Surabhi R.M. Park K.J. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. Gaynor R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), whereas MEKK1 is involved in Tax-induced NF-κB activation (21Yin M.J. Christerson L.B. Yamamoto Y. Kwak Y.T. Xu S. Mercurio F. Barbosa M. Cobb M.H. Gaynor R.B. Cell. 1998; 93: 875-884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). NF-κB can also be activated in the absence of extracellular signals by overexpression of TAK1 and TAB1 together or by NF-κB-interacting kinase alone (4Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishimoto K. Hiyama A. Inoue J. Cao Z. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 398: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar, 22Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1166) Google Scholar). To examine whether the effect of 5Z-7-oxozeaenol is specific to NF-κB activation mediated by TAK1, cells were treated with TNF or transfected TAK1, TAB1, Tax, or NF-κB-interacting kinase expression vectors. We found that 5Z-7-oxozeaenol treatment effectively inhibited activation of NF-κB induced by TNF and overexpression of TAK1 and TAB1, whereas it had marginal inhibitory effect on activation of NF-κB induced by overexpression of Tax or NF-κB-interacting kinase (Fig. 3A). These results suggest that 5Z-7-oxozeaenol specifically inhibits NF-κB activation by blocking TAK1 activity. The IC50 value of 5Z-7-oxozeaenol required to inhibit NF-κB activation by overexpression of TAK1 and TAB1 was 83 nm (Fig. 3B). This IC50 is 10-fold higher than that required to inhibit purified TAK1 in vitro(Fig. 1A). We next examined whether 5Z-7-oxozeaenol inhibits IL-1-induced JNK/p38 activation. We pretreated 293-IL-1RI cells with increasing amounts of 5Z-7-oxozeaenol and stimulated the cells with IL-1 treatment. The activated JNK and p38 were detected with anti-phospho-JNK and -p38 antibodies that specifically recognize the dually phosphorylated activated forms of JNK1/JNK2 and p38, respectively (Fig. 4A). IL-1-dependent JNK/p38 activation was abrogated with treatment of 5Z-7-oxozeaenol in a dose-dependent manner. The amount of 5Z-7-oxozeaenol required to inhibit IL-1-induced JNK/p38 activation was in a similar range to that required for NF-κB inhibition. To further examine the specificity of 5Z-7-oxozeaenol, we tested the effect of 5Z-7-oxozeaenol on MAPK cascades activated by several other stimuli. Hydrogen peroxide is a strong stimulator of JNK/p38; however, it poorly activates TAK1 in 293-IL-1RI cells, 2J. Ninomiya-Tsuji, unpublished result. suggesting that TAK1 is not involved in this pathway. 293-IL-1RI cells were treated with 5Z-7-oxozeaenol for 30 min followed by hydrogen peroxide simulation (Fig. 4B). No pronounced inhibition of either JNK or p38 activation was observed in 5Z-7-oxozeaenol-treated cells. We also assayed UV- and EGF-induced ERK activation. UV and EGF activate the MEK-ERK MAP kinase cascade, in which TAK1 does not participate. 293-IL-1RI cells were pretreated with 5Z-7-oxozeaenol and stimulated with UV or EGF. The activated ERK was detected with anti-phospho-ERK antibody that specifically recognizes the dually phosphorylated activated forms of ERK1 and ERK2 (Fig. 4, C and D). 5Z-7-Oxozeaenol had little effect on UV- or EGF-induced ERK activation even at a concentration of 500 nm. These results suggest that 5Z-7-oxozeaenol selectively inhibits TAK1, thereby inhibiting IL-1-induced JNK/p38 activation in culture cells. We then examined whether 5Z-7-oxozeaenol inhibits kinase activity of endogenous TAK1 upon IL-1 stimulation. We have previously observed that TAK1 is transiently activated around 2–5 min after IL-1 stimulation when 293-IL-1RI cells were treated with IL-1 (8Takaesu G. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishida S. Li X. Stark G.R. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2475-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). We treated 293-IL-1RI cells with various concentrations of 5Z-7-oxozeaenol prior to IL-1 stimulation. At 5 min after IL-1 stimulation, cells were lysed, and endogenous TAK1 was immunoprecipitated with anti-TAK1 antibody. The catalytic activity of TAK1 was measured using MKK6 as a substrate (Fig.5A, upper panel). Treatment of the cells with 5Z-7-oxozeaenol inhibited kinase activity of endogenous TAK1. The IC50 of 5Z-7-oxozeaenol to inhibit endogenous TAK1 was 65 nm (Fig. 5A), which is correlated with the IC50 to inhibit NF-κB and JNK/p38 activation (Fig. 3and 4). We next tested whether the 5Z-oxozeaenol-mediated inhibition of TAK1 in culture cells is reversible or irreversible. We treated 293-IL-1RI cells with 100 nm 5Z-7-oxozeaenol for 30 min and then incubated for an additional 30 min without 5Z-7-oxozeaenol. The cells were subsequently stimulated with IL-1, and the catalytic activity of endogenous TAK1 was measured (Fig.5B). 5Z-7-Oxozeaenol significantly inhibited TAK1 kinase activity even after 5Z-7-oxozeaenol was removed from the culture medium. These results suggest that 5Z-7-oxozeaenol irreversibly binds to and inhibits TAK1 in 293-IL-1RI cells, consistent with the result showing that 5Z-7-oxozeaenol irreversibly inhibits ATP binding to TAK1in vitro (Fig. 1D). Thus, it is likely that 5Z-7-oxozeaenol, when added into the culture medium, inhibits TAK1 activity by irreversibly inhibiting the binding of ATP to TAK1. We also investigated the time course of activation of TAK1, IKK, JNK, and p38 upon IL-1 stimulation. In this assay, 293-IL-1RI cells were treated with 500 nm 5Z-7-oxozeaenol for 30 min to completely inhibit kinase activity of TAK1 and then stimulated with IL-1 (Fig. 6). Cells were harvested at 3 and 12 min post-IL-1 stimulation, and the lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-TAK1 followed by in vitrokinase assay (Fig. 6A). 5Z-7-Oxozeaenol treatment abolished IL-1-induced activation of TAK1. We have previously shown that autophosphorylation of TAK1 upon IL-1 stimulation is essential for its activation (7Kishimoto K. Matsumoto K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7359-7364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). TAK1 autophosphorylation can be detected on SDS-PAGE as slowly migrating TAK1 bands (Fig.6A, lower panel). We observed that 5Z-7-oxozeaenol inhibited IL-1-induced autophosphorylation of TAK1. We have also previously demonstrated that endogenous TAK1 constitutively interacts with TAB1 (7Kishimoto K. Matsumoto K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7359-7364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The amount of coprecipitated TAB1 in TAK1 immunoprecipitates was not changed with treatment of 5Z-7-oxozeaenol (Fig. 6A, lower panel), suggesting that 5Z-7-oxozeaenol did not interfere with interaction of TAK1 with TAB1. IKK activity was measured using GST-IκB as a substrate (Fig. 6B). 5Z-7-Oxozeaenol treatment inhibited 70–80% of the kinase activity of the IL-1-induced IKK activity. Since 5Z-7-oxozeaenol had no inhibitory effect on kinase activity of IKK itself (Fig. 2), 5Z-7-oxozeaenol presumably inhibits IL-1-induced activation of IKK by inhibiting TAK1 activity. We also observed that 5Z-7-oxozeaenol abolished IL-1-induced activation of JNK and p38 (Fig. 6, C and D). Taken together, our results indicate that 5Z-7-oxozeaenol inhibits the IL-1 signaling pathways that normally lead to activation of both NF-κB and JNK/p38 by inhibiting TAK1. IL-1 is a proinflammatory cytokine that induces the expression of many genes that up-regulate inflammation (23Dinarello C.A. Blood. 1996; 87: 2095-2147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One such gene product is cyclooxgenase 2 (COX-2), which catalyzes the production of prostaglandin (24Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. Garavito R.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 145-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2477) Google Scholar). We tested the effect of 5Z-7-oxozeaenol on IL-1-induced COX-2 production (Fig.7A). The level of COX-2 proteins was increased after IL-1 treatment, whereas no increase was detected when cells were pretreated with 5Z-7-oxozeaenol, even in the presence of IL-1. Thus, 5Z-7-oxozeaenol inhibits production of inflammation mediators. We next examined whether 5Z-7-oxozeaenol could suppress inflammation in vivo. For this experiment, we used PC-induced ear swelling as a model for COX-2-mediated inflammation. The ear swelling system has been widely used as a model for allergic cutaneous diseases and inflammatory skin disorders (25Krueger G.G. Stingl G. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1989; 92: 32-51Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 26Weston W.L. Ann. Allergy. 1976; 37: 346-352PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, it has been shown that inhibitors of COX-2 block PC-induced ear swelling (27Lavaud P. Rodrigue F. Carre C. Touvay C. Mencia-Huerta J.M. Braquet P. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1991; 97: 101-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Furthermore, reduction of IL-1 production have also been shown to block ear swelling induced by PC (28Goto Y. Inoue Y. Tsuchiya M. Isobe M. Ueno T. Uchi H. Furue M. Hayashi H. Int. Arch. Allergy Immunol. 2000; 123: 341-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), suggesting that IL-1 signaling is involved in this disorder. When 5Z-7-oxozeaenol was administrated to the PC-challenged ear, ear swelling was reduced by up to 50% of that of the control ear treated with vehicle (Fig.7B). Thus, 5Z-7-oxozeaenol is able to prevent inflammation, probably through inhibiting TAK1 activity. Our screening for a TAK1 kinase inhibitor identified a natural compound, 5Z-7-oxozeaenol, a fungal resorcylic acid lactone that has been previously reported to inhibit endotoxin-induced production of TNF (29Rawlins P. Mander T. Sadeghi R. Hill S. Gammon G. Foxwell B. Wrigley S. Moore M. Int. J. Immunopharmacol. 1999; 21: 799-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). 5Z-7-Oxozeaenol is also able to inhibit anisomycin-induced JNK/p38 activation (30Takehana K. Sato S. Kobayasi T. Maeda T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms underlying these inhibitory effects had been unclear. Here we demonstrate that 5Z-7-oxozeaenol specifically inhibits the catalytic activity of TAK1. Since TAK1 is activated upon treatment with various endotoxins and stresses, it is likely that 5Z-7-oxozeaenol might inhibit TAK1 activity activated by endotoxin and anisomycin, thereby reducing TNF production and JNK/p38 activation. TAK1 is a multifunctional protein kinase involved not only in the IL-1 signaling pathway but also in the transforming growth factor-β family signaling pathway (3Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Shibuya H.

Irie K. Matsumoto K. Nishida E. Ueno N. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1019-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have recently found that TAK1 is involved in a MAP kinase-like pathway that negatively regulates the Wnt signaling pathway (32Ishitani T. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Nagai S. Nishita M.

Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Since 5Z-7-oxozeaenol is a highly potent and selective inhibitor of TAK1, this compound will be a useful tool for studies on these signal transduction pathways. Furthermore, in this study, we show that when applied topically, 5Z-7-oxozeaenol significantly reduces the level of PC-induced ear swelling. These results suggest that 5Z-7-oxozeaenol might be a useful therapeutic agent for allergic cutaneous disorders such as allergic contact dermatitis and atopic dermatitis. We thank H. Ichijo, S.

Moreover, expression of the GluR1 cytoplasmic tail, a construct that inhibits synaptic delivery of endogenous AMPA-Rs during long-term potentiation, blocked experience-driven synaptic potentiation.

Clp/Hsp100 proteins can be classified into two distinct subfamilies. Class I proteins (ClpA and ClpB inE. coli) are composed of two highly conserved nucleotide binding domains (termed ATP-1 and ATP-2), whereas class II proteins (ClpX and HslU, as representatives of E. coli) contain only a single NBD (homologous to ATP-2) (1Schirmer E.C.

Sequence analysis of the NBDs revealed a significant sequence homology between Clp/Hsp100 and AAA proteins (ATPase associated with a variety of cellular activities), and consequently a new AAA+ superfamily, representing both protein classes, was proposed (2Neuwald A.F.

The conserved AAA-domain (also referred to as AAA module) is made up of two domains, a core region that forms the nucleotide binding pocket, containing the classical Walker A and B motifs, and a C-terminal α-helical domain (C-domain). The ATP binding pocket is located at the interface of neighboring subunits in the oligomer. The C-domain contacts its own core ATPase domain and that of adjacent subunits and is involved in nucleotide binding and hexamerization in HslU (3Bochtler M. Hartmann C. Song H.K. Bourenkov G.P.

ClpA and ClpB have homologous N-domains of about 150 residues that consist of two sequence repeats and form an independent structural domain still of unknown function (7Lo J.H. Baker T.A. Sauer R.T.

Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18843-18848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), whereas HslU lacks an N-terminal domain but rather contains an extra domain (the I-domain) inserted into the AAA-domain (3Bochtler M.

The most striking difference between members within the class I subfamily is the presence/absence of a region that is proposed to link the two AAA-domains ATP-1 and ATP-2. The presence of this variable linker region serves as a criteria for classification of Hsp100 proteins; the linker is longest in ClpB (∼140 residues) but is absent in ClpA (see Fig. 1) (1Schirmer E.C. Glover J.R. Singer M.A. Lindquist S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 289-296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar).ClpB is unique among the Hsp100/Clp proteins because it does not associate with a proteolytic partner protein. Recently, an essential docking site of the peptidase ClpP was identified within ClpX (9Kim Y.I. Levchenko I. Fraczkowska K. Woodruff R.V. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Nat. Struct.

The signature motif (LIV-G-FL) is conserved in all other ClpP-interacting proteins like ClpA but is missing in ClpB, thereby explaining why ClpB acts independently of peptidases. Instead ClpB mediates the resolubilization of aggregated proteins in cooperation with the DnaK chaperone system (10Goloubinoff P. Mogk A. Peres Ben Zvi A. Tomoyasu T. Bukau B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The mechanism of the disaggregation reaction and the basis of ClpB/DnaK cooperation are still not understood.Here we report a structure-function analysis of ClpB that is aimed at identifying the roles of individual domains and conserved motifs in the disaggregation process and the coupling of the ATPase cycle with the chaperone activity. Constructed ClpB variants were characterized with respect to their structural integrity, as determined by oligomerization studies and partial proteolysis. Additionally the ATPase and chaperone activities of all constructs were tested.DISCUSSIONHere we present a detailed structure-function analysis of the AAA+ chaperone ClpB, which mediates resolubilization of protein aggregates in cooperation with the DnaK chaperone system. Oligomerization of ClpB was dependent on both AAA-domains; however, each domain seemed to play a different role in ClpB assembly. Deletion of the α-helical C-domain of the second AAA-domain (ClpB ΔSSD) resulted in a severe defect in oligomerization defect. ClpB ΔSSD stayed predominantly monomeric even in cross-linking experiments. On the other hand we could demonstrate that ATP binding to the first AAA-domain was also necessary for stabilizing the ClpB hexamer. Several observations support this model. First, the Walker A (K212A) and Arg finger (R332A) mutants of the first AAA module did not form stable hexamers in the presence of ATP, whereas corresponding mutations in the second nucleotide binding domain (K611A and R756A) had no influence on ClpB oligomerization, although these mutants exhibited severe structural deficiencies. Second, the introduction of amino acids into the C-domain of the first AAA module (ClpB-(Δ410–532) and ClpB ΔLBL) also resulted in destabilization of ClpB oligomers, underlining the importance of this domain in hexamerization. We also could show that high salt conditions (addition of 100 mm(NH4)2SO4) cause dissociation of ClpB oligomers by interfering predominantly with subunit contacts between the first AAA-domains. Interestingly, the recently determined structure of monomeric ClpA suggests that electrostatic interactions between the first AAA-domains of ClpA could play a much more important role than the second AAA modules in protein oligomerization (29Guo F. Maurizi M.R. Esser L. Xia D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46743-46752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). These findings might also explain the observed salt sensitivity of ClpB oligomerization and underline the functional importance of the first AAA-domain in this process. Finally, the observed changes in fluorescence of Trp-543, located in the C-domain of the first AAA module, revealed a conformational rearrangement of this region in response to nucleotides. The observed blue shift (4 nm) in the wavelength for maximum fluorescence could be attributed to ClpB oligomerization. We suggest that changes in Trp-543 fluorescence reflect interactions of the first C-domain not only with itself but also adjacent ATPase domains, thereby leading to increased shielding of Trp-543 and stabilization of the oligomer. Nucleotide-dependent conformational changes of the C-terminal α-helical domain was also demonstrated by limited proteolysis. Whereas the C-domain was rapidly degraded in the absence of nucleotides, it became largely resistant to proteases upon nucleotide addition (Fig. 5B). Similarly the C-domain of the second AAA module was also protected by addition of nucleotides. This protection is likely to be caused by the interaction of C-domains with their own AAA-domain and that of adjacent subunits, thereby becoming less accessible to proteases. Consistently, ClpB mutants with defects in nucleotide binding (K212A and K611A;813AAA815) did not exhibit stabilization of the corresponding C-domains.A functional importance of the first ATPase domain for Hsp100 oligomerization has also been reported for E. coli ClpA (30Singh S.K. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29537-29545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,31Seol J.H. Baek S.H. Kang M.-S. Ha D.B. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8087-8092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and ClpB from Thermus thermophilus (32Watanabe Y.H. Motohashi K. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5804-5809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). It is intriguing that the contributions of the individual AAA-domains differ in the ClpB homologues Hsp104 and Hsp78 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here mutations of the Lys residue in the Walker A motif of the second AAA-domain resulted in a loss of ability to form hexamers (33Parsell D.A. Kowal A.S. Lindquist S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4480-4487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Schirmer E.C. Queitsch C. Kowal A.S. Parsell D.A. Lindquist S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15546-15552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 35Krzewska J. Konopa G. Liberek K. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 901-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).Hexamerization of ClpB is a prerequisite for its chaperone activity. Because ATP is bound at the interface of two neighboring subunits in the hexamer, oligomerization additionally influences the ATPase activity of ClpB. Consequently high salt conditions inhibit ATP hydrolysis by ClpB. Furthermore, ClpB variants with defects in oligomerization exhibited little or no ATPase activity. On the other hand, the stimulation of ATP hydrolysis by substrates, such as α-casein, is most likely because of the stabilization of ClpB oligomers.Mutations of conserved Lys and Glu residues in the Walker A and Walker B motifs of both AAA modules completely abolished ATP hydrolysis by the corresponding AAA-domain. Because single mutants still retained significant ATPase activity, both AAA-domains seem to contribute to the basal rate of ATP hydrolysis by ClpB. Interestingly, ClpB homologues from different organisms differ significantly in their ATPase cycle. Although both AAA-domains of ClpB from T. thermophilus (26Schlee S. Groemping Y. Herde P. Seidel R. Reinstein J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 889-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar,32Watanabe Y.H. Motohashi K. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5804-5809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) also contribute to the basal ATPase activity, ATP hydrolysis by the yeast homologue Hsp104 is dominated by the first AAA module (25Hattendorf D.A. Lindquist S.L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Such differences may potentially explain the observed species specificity in the cooperation of ClpB/Hsp104 proteins with the corresponding Hsp70 partners (36Krzewska J. Langer T. Liberek K. FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Variations in the basal ATPase activity of ClpB mutants indicate communication between both AAA-domains. However, different mutations in the same AAA-domain (E678A and R756A) exhibited different influences on the ATPase activity of the other AAA module. The signaling between both AAA-domains appears to be rather complex, and subtle conformational changes within ClpB mutants can have completely different consequences on the other AAA module.The function of the N-domain still remains enigmatic. Isolated N-domains from ClpA and ClpB have been shown to form stable, monomeric domains, which are probably separated from the AAA-domains by a flexible linker (7Lo J.H. Baker T.A. Sauer R.T. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 551-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 37Singh S.K. Rozycki J. Ortega J. Ishikawa T. Lo J. Steven A.C. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29420-29429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 38Tek V. Zolkiewski M. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1192-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Consistent with this model, N-domains are not essential for oligomerization of ClpA or ClpB (23, 37, and this work). The connector is apparently sterically inaccessible to proteases because partial proteolysis of ClpB did not release significant amounts of isolated N-domains but rather produced a fragment comprising the N-domain and the core domain of the first AAA module (aa 1–353). Similar findings have been reported for ClpA (37Singh S.K. Rozycki J. Ortega J. Ishikawa T. Lo J. Steven A.C. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29420-29429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The reported consequences of N-terminal deletions of ClpB on its chaperone activity are contradictory. Zolkiewski and co-workers (23Barnett M.E. Zolkiewska A. Zolkiewski M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37565-37571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) showed that a ClpB variant, starting from the internal start site (aa 149–857), was completely inactive in refolding of aggregated luciferase. In contrast, a ClpB ΔN-(143–857) variant showed the same chaperone activity as wild type ClpB both in vitro and in vivo(resolubilization of protein aggregates and development of thermotolerance). In agreement with these data, an N-terminal truncated ClpB derivative of Synechococcus sp. PCC7942 conferred the same degree of thermotolerance in vivo as full-length ClpB; likewise, the N-terminal truncated version of T. thermophilus ClpB was also shown to be active in protein disaggregation in vitro (39Clarke A.K. Eriksson M.J. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 7092-7096Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 40Beinker P. Schlee S. Groemping Y. Seidel R. Reinstein J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47160-47166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The existence of ClpB homologues completely lacking an N-domain in Mycoplasma sp. also argues against an essential function of the N-domains in the disaggregating activities of ClpB (41Fraser C.M. Gocayne J.D. White O. Adams M.D. Clayton R.A. Fleischmann R.D. Bult C.J. Kerlavage A.R. Sutton G. Kelley J.M. et al.Science. 1995; 270: 397-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (2105) Google Scholar, 42Himmelreich R. Hilbert H. Plagens H. Pirkl E. Li B.C. Herrmann R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4420-4449Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar).What might be the function of the N-domain with respect to these conflicting results? N-domains have been proposed to mediate substrate binding; however, the reported activities of N-terminally truncated ClpB variants clearly rule out an essential function in this process. Interestingly, defects in substrate binding were also not the basis of the inactivation of ClpB-(149–857), because this deletion variant interacted with casein and unfolded luciferase indistinguishable from ClpB wild type (38Tek V. Zolkiewski M. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1192-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). N-domains may therefore be involved in a mechanism for coupling the ATPase cycle of ClpB with its proposed unfolding activity. Because a longer deletion of the N-domain, including parts of the flexible linker to the first AAA-domain, has been reported to be inactive, this linker could potentially contribute to induced structural changes in bound substrates. Alternatively, N-domains may be involved in other ClpB activities, which are so far unknown and are not related to protein disaggregation. Such new activities have been described for a second ClpB homologue in Synechococcus, which is essential for cell viability but is not involved in thermotolerance (43Eriksson M.J. Schelin J. Miskiewicz E. Clarke A.K. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 7392-7396Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the N-domain of this ClpB variant seems to be crucial for its unknown activity and may serve as binding sites for special substrates or, alternatively, for specific adaptor proteins. Binding of adaptor proteins to N-domains has been demonstrated for ClpA (44Dougan D.A. Reid B.G. Horwich A.L. Bukau B. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 673-683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) and the AAA protein p97 (45Rouiller I. Butel V.M. Latterich M. Milligan R.A. Wilson-Kubalek E.M. Mol.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2181-2192Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar).The linker region of ClpB was originally suggested to separate both AAA-domains (1Schirmer E.C. Glover J.R. Singer M.A. Lindquist S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 289-296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). We propose that the linker instead interrupts the C-domain of the first AAA-domain as was suggested recently (47Cashikar A.G. Schirmer E.C. Hattendorf D.A. Glover J.R. Ramakrishnan M.S. Ware D.M. Lindquist S.L. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 751-760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) for the yeast homologue Hsp104. A comparison of different ClpB fragments (aa 1–409 and 1–567) with respect to their oligomerization and their resistance to proteolysis supports this model. First, cross-linking studies revealed that ClpB-(1–567) can form dimeric species in contrast to the shorter variant (aa 1–409), which remains monomeric under all conditions. Additionally, partial proteolysis revealed a more pronounced protection of the full-length version (aa 1–567), which was not observed for ClpB-(1–409). Formation of dimeric species and the observed partial stabilization is likely to be caused by the interaction of the helical C-domain, which can only be formed in ClpB-(1–567), with its own and an adjacent AAA-domain. Interestingly, a very similar domain organization has been proposed for ClpA (37Singh S.K. Rozycki J. Ortega J. Ishikawa T. Lo J. Steven A.C. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29420-29429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In ClpA, which is missing the linker region, a short basic loop (KRKK) is also inserted into the C-domain of the first AAA module.The linker region of ClpB, in contrast to the N-domain, is essential for chaperone activity. It is proposed to form a 4 times repeated coiled-coil (48Celerin M. Gilpin A.A. Schisler N.J. Ivanov A.G. Miskiewicz E. Krol M. Laudenbach D.E. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5173-5182Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is very likely to play an important role in ClpB function. Conformational changes in response to nucleotides within the linker region were shown by its increased proteolytic stability in the context of full-length ClpB. We assume that the linker is not an integral part of the ClpB hexamer, because oligomerization was still possible in case of a ClpB variant missing the linker region (ClpB-(Δ410–532)). Similarly, the I-domain of HslU, although inserted into the AAA-domain, forms an independent structural domain and is exposed at the surface of the oligomer (3Bochtler M. Hartmann C. Song H.K. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Nature. 2000; 403: 800-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 4Sousa M.C. Trame C.B. Tsuruta H. Wilbanks S.M. Reddy V.S. McKay D.B. Cell. 2000; 103: 633-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The function of the linker region is still unknown. The postulated coiled-coil structure might be involved in protein-protein interaction. Because the ATPase activity of ClpB-(Δ410–532) was still strongly stimulable by casein, the linker region cannot serve as a primary substrate-binding site, at least for this type of substrate. Alternatively, the linker region is necessary for coupling ATP hydrolysis and substrate unfolding, as proposed recently by Lindquist and co-workers (47Cashikar A.G. Schirmer E.C. Hattendorf D.A. Glover J.R. Ramakrishnan M.S. Ware D.M. Lindquist S.L. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 751-760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The Escherichia coli chaperone ClpB belongs to the ring-forming Clp/Hsp100 proteins. Clp/Hsp100 proteins can be classified into two distinct subfamilies. Class I proteins (ClpA and ClpB inE. coli) are composed of two highly conserved nucleotide binding domains (termed ATP-1 and ATP-2), whereas class II proteins (ClpX and HslU, as representatives of E. coli) contain only a single NBD (homologous to ATP-2) (1Schirmer E.C. Glover J.R. Singer M.A. Lindquist S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 289-296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of the NBDs revealed a significant sequence homology between Clp/Hsp100 and AAA proteins (ATPase associated with a variety of cellular activities), and consequently a new AAA+ superfamily, representing both protein classes, was proposed (2Neuwald A.F. Aravind L. Spouge J.L. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 27-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The structural basis of this superfamily was confirmed by determination of the first Clp/Hsp100 protein structure, HslU, that showed significant similarity to the AAA proteins N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein and p97 (3Bochtler M. Hartmann C. Song H.K. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Nature. 2000; 403: 800-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 4Sousa M.C. Trame C.B. Tsuruta H. Wilbanks S.M. Reddy V.S.

To breach the specialized blood-brain barrier, activated leukocytes interact with CNS endothelial cells (EC) and activate a CD54-mediated signaling pathway controlling the Rho GTPase. To function correctly Rho requires posttranslational prenylation, and this can be inhibited by depleting the supply of isoprenoids through inhibition of the cholesterol synthesis pathway with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase (HMG-CoA reductase) inhibitors (statins). Here we show that treatment of brain EC in vitro with lovastatin inhibits Rho-mediated transendothelial T cell migration. This effect can be reversed by supplementation with mevalonolactone, the downstream product of HMG-CoA reductase, or by ectopic expression of myristoylated Rho, which remains active in the absence of prenylation. In a relapsing-remitting mouse model of MS, lovastatin treatment inhibited leukocyte migration into the CNS and significantly attenuated the development of both acute and relapsing clinical disease. These studies demonstrate that the indirect pharmacological inhibition of Rho proteins in brain EC by statins can inhibit a key stage in the pathogenesis of neuroinflammation, namely leukocyte migration across the blood-brain barrier. These studies demonstrate a novel effect of statins in modulating the immune response in neuroinflammtory diseases and may provide additional rationale for their use in the treatment of MS."

Indeed, no significant associations with mothers' welfare and employment transitions were found for preschoolers, and the dominant pattern was also of few statistically significant associations for adolescents. The associations that did occur provided slight evidence that mothers' entry into the labor force was related to improvements in adolescents' mental health, whereas exits from employment were linked with teenagers' increased behavior problems."
https://openalex.org/W2065589829,"Mutations in the cytochrome P450 family 1, subfamily B, polypeptide 1 (CYP1B1) gene are a common cause of human primary congenital glaucoma (PCG). Here we show that Cyp1b1-/- mice have ocular drainage structure abnormalities resembling those reported in human PCG patients. Using Cyp1b1-/- mice, we identified the tyrosinase gene (Tyr) as a modifier of the drainage structure phenotype, with Tyr deficiency increasing the magnitude of dysgenesis. The severe dysgenesis in eyes lacking both CYP1B1 and TYR was alleviated by administration of the tyrosinase product dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-dopa). Tyr also modified the drainage structure dysgenesis in mice with a mutant Foxc1 gene, which is also involved in PCG. These experiments raise the possibility that a tyrosinase/l-dopa pathway modifies human PCG, which could open new therapeutic avenues."

Certain diarylsulfonylureas inhibit this response, and are designated cytokine release inhibitory drugs (CRIDs). CRIDs arrest activated monocytes so that caspase-1 remains inactive and plasma membrane latency is preserved. Affinity labeling with [14C]CRIDs and affinity chromatography on immobilized CRID were used in seeking potential protein targets of their action. Following treatment of intact human monocytes with an epoxide-bearing [14C]CRID, glutathioneS-transferase (GST) Omega 1-1 was identified as a preferred target. Moreover, labeling of this polypeptide correlated with irreversible inhibition of ATP-induced IL-1औ posttranslational processing. When extracts of human monocytic cells were chromatographed on a CRID affinity column, GST Omega 1-1 bound selectively to the affinity matrix and was eluted by soluble CRID. Recombinant GST Omega 1-1 readily incorporated [14C]CRID epoxides, but labeling was negated by co-incubation with S-substituted glutathiones or by mutagenesis of the catalytic center Cys32 to alanine. Peptide mapping by high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry also demonstrated that Cys32 was the site of modification. AlthoughS-alkylglutathiones did not arrest ATP-induced IL-1औ posttranslational processing or inhibit [14C]CRID incorporation into cell-associated GST Omega 1-1, a glutathione-CRID adduct effectively demonstrated these attributes.

Int. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 457-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Unlike most other cytokines generated by these cells, IL-1 is not constitutively released. Rather, efficient IL-1 export requires that the cytokine-producing cell encounter an effector that initiates an unusual posttranslational processing mechanism leading to cytokine release (2Hogquist K.A.

A separate secretion stimulus is needed because the initial IL-1 translation product lacks a signal sequence (5March C.J. Mosley B. Larsen A. Cerretti D.P. Braedt G. Price V. Gillis S. Henney C.S.

Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 87-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). From this location, polypeptides destined for secretion typically proceed to the cell surface via a common secretory apparatus involving the Golgi complex and small secretory vesicles (8Traub L.M. Kornfeld S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In the absence of the recognition marker for entry to the endoplasmic reticulum, newly synthesized IL-1 accumulates within the cytoplasmic compartment (9Singer I.I. Scott S. Hall G.L. Limjuco G.

Separate but related genes encode the procytokine forms of IL-1α and IL-1औ (5March C.J. Mosley B. Larsen A. Cerretti D.P. Braedt G. Price V. Gillis S. Henney C.S. Kronheim S.R. Grabstein K.

In response to proper cellular stimuli, the 31-kDa translation products of both genes are proteolytically processed to the mature 17-kDa cytokines. In the case of IL-1α, the mature and procytokine species both are capable of binding to the IL-1 receptor complex and initiating cytokine signaling (11Mosley B. Urdal D.L. Prickett K.S. Larsen A.

ATP-induced IL-1औ posttranslational processing proceeds via activation of the P2X7 receptor, a ligand-gated ion channel. Immediately following ATP binding, the P2X7receptor acts as a non-selective cation channel (25Surprenant A. Rassendren F. Kawashima E. North R.A. Buell G.

Receptor mutagenesis has suggested that the intracellular carboxyl terminus of the receptor polypeptide is necessary for pore formation (25Surprenant A. Rassendren F. Kawashima E. North R.A. Buell G. Science. 1996; 272: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1496) Google Scholar), but whether the pore forms as a result of a change in the receptor itself or as a result of an association with other polypeptides remains to be determined (30Schilling W.P.

We recently identified a series of cytokine release inhibitory drugs (CRIDs) that potently and selectively disrupt stimulus-induced IL-1औ posttranslational processing (44Perregaux D.G. McNiff P. Laliberte R. Hawryluk N. Peurano H. Stam E. Eggler J. Griffiths R. Dombroski M.A. Gabel C.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 299: 187-197PubMed Google Scholar). These agents do not directly inhibit caspase-1, and they do not act as antagonists of the P2X7 receptor; their mechanism of action remains to be established. This paper describes studies aimed at identifying their molecular target. Our results indicate that GST Omega 1-1, an atypical member of the glutathioneS-transferase superfamily previously associated with stress-induced apoptosis, is a CRID-binding protein. Therefore, GST Omega 1-1 may perform an important, although currently unidentified, role in ATP-induced IL-1औ posttranslational processing. 1-(4-Chloro-2,6-diisopropylphenyl)-3-[2-fluoro-5-oxiranyl benzenesulfonyl]urea (CP-452,759; CRID 1), [14C]CRID 1, 1-(1,2,3,5,6,7- hexahydro-s-indacen-4-yl)-3-[2-fluoro-5-oxiranylbenzenesulfonyl]urea (CP-470,947; CRID 2), and [14C]CRID 2 were prepared as detailed previously (45Eggler J.F.

CRID 3 was isolated as the sodium salt by precipitation with pentane and filtration, and was purified by recrystallization from isopropyl alcohol (m.p. of free acid = 153–154 °C). 1,2-Epoxy-3-(4-nitrophenoxy)propane was purchased from Ryan Scientific (Isle of Palms, SC). 1-(1,2,3,5,6,7-Hexahydro-s-indacen-4-yl)-3-[2-fluoro-5-(2-amino-4-[1-(carboxymethylcarbamoyl)-2-(2-hydroxyethylsulfanyl)ethylcarbamoyl]butyric acid)benzenesulfonyl]urea trisodium salt (CRID 2-SG) was prepared by reaction of glutathione with CRID 2 in the presence of 0.1m sodium methoxide in methanol and was purified by trituration from tetrahydrofuran. Human carbonic anhydrase (type II) and porcine liver carboxyl esterase were purchased from Sigma. A plasmid encoding human glyoxalase I was obtained from Dr. Bengt Mannervik (Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden) and expressed inE. coli; the recombinant polypeptide was purified and assayed as previously described (48Ridderstrom M. Cameron A.D. Jones T.A. Mannervik B. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis by automated Edman degradation was performed on an Applied Biosystems model 494 Procise sequencing system. Proteins isolated in the form of Coomassie Blue-stained gel bands were reduced with DTT,S-alkylated with iodoacetamide, and digested with trypsin (Promega chemically modified, sequencing grade) or Glu-C (Roche Applied Science, sequencing grade) by the method of Stone and Williams (49Stone K.L. Williams K.R. Matsudaira P. A Practical Guide to Protein and Peptide Purification for Microsequencing. Academic Press, San Diego1993: 43-69Crossref Google Scholar). Peptide mapping of the digests by LC-MS was conducted using a Vydac C18 column (type 218TP51) operating at 0.1 ml/min with a gradient of acetonitrile in 0.17 trifluoroacetic acid. A Hewlett-Packard model 1090 chromatograph was used in tandem with a Thermo Finnigan LCQ ion-trap mass spectrometer using a standard Finnigan electrospray interface and controlled by Xcalibur software. For experiments to identify the site of affinity labeling, the chromatograph was an Agilent 1100 operating at 5 ॖl/min with a Vydac type 218MS5.510 column (0.5 × 100 mm). The HPLC solvents were: A, 0.027 trifluoroacetic acid; B, 0.027 trifluoroacetic acid in CH3CN. From initial conditions of 1.67 B (0–2 min), the gradient consisted of steps from 1.6 to 357 B (2–98 min) and from 35 to 807B (98–108 min). The standard Finnigan electrospray interface was modified by replacing the sample needle with a coated fused silica tip (TaperTip; part no. TT150-50-50-CE-5, New Objective Inc., Woburn, MA). Data-dependent MS/MS was performed on MS peaks exceeding a preset threshold (50Jonscher K.R. Yates J.R. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 244: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), and proteins were identified by data base searching using a version of the SEQUEST program (51Eng J.K. McCormack A.L. Yates III, J.R. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1994; 5: 976-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (5386) Google Scholar) licensed from Finnigan. When necessary, the spectrometer was programmed to select specific peaks for multistage MS using standard programming features of Xcalibur. Human mononuclear cells were isolated from normal volunteers as previously detailed (15Perregaux D. Gabel C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15195-15203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 2.5 × 107 mononuclear cells were seeded into each well of a 60-mm dish, and monocytes were allowed to attach for 2 h at 37 °C. Media and nonattached cells were then removed, and 5 ml of fresh serum-free medium (Invitrogen; catalog no. 12065-074) containing 0.17 penicillin/streptomycin and 100 ng/ml macrophage colony stimulating factor was added to each dish. These cultures were incubated overnight at 37 °C in a 57 CO2 environment after which FBS and LPS (Sigma; E. coli serotype 055:B5) were introduced to achieve final concentrations of 57 and 10 ng/ml, respectively. Following an additional 3-h incubation, media were removed, the cells were washed several times with RPMI medium devoid of FBS, and then 3 ml of RPMI 1640 medium containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 6.9, and the indicated concentration of either [14C]CRID 1 or [14C]CRID 2 was added, and the cultures were incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. The cells subsequently were washed repeatedly with RPMI 1640 medium containing 25 mm Hepes, 5 mmsodium bicarbonate, pH 6.9, 17 FBS, 2 mm glutamine, 17 penicillin/streptomycin (Chase Medium). At this point, labeled cells in some experiments were subjected to ATP activation; 3 ml of fresh Chase Medium containing 2 mm ATP was added to each dish and the cultures were incubated for 60 min. Following this treatment, the dishes were placed on ice and media were removed for IL-1औ analysis (by ELISA). Cells, with or without ATP treatment, were extracted with 1 ml of 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 ॖg/ml leupeptin, 1 ॖg/ml pepstatin, 0.1 mm PMSF, and 0.57 saponin for 30 min on ice. These extracts subsequently were clarified by centrifugation (45,000 rpm in a Beckman TLA.4 rotor). Resulting supernatants were recovered as the soluble fraction and were concentrated by Centricon YM-30 (Millipore, Bedford, MA) centrifugation. The final concentrates were lyophilized overnight, then resuspended in SDS sample buffer. The saponin-insoluble microsomal pellets were solubilized directly into SDS sample buffer. All SDS-containing samples subsequently were heated at 56 °C for 3 min; heating to higher temperatures was avoided because of breakdown of the radiolabel. The disaggregated samples then were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the resulting dried gel was profiled by autoradiography and/or phosphorimager analysis. To allow visualization of the mature cytokine species, a metabolic labeling approach was employed to study IL-1औ posttranslational processing. For this approach, 1 × 107 mononuclear cells were added to each well of six-well multi-dishes in 2 ml of RPMI 1640 containing 25 mm Hepes, 57 FBS, 2 mm glutamine, 17 penicillin/streptomycin, pH 7.2 (Maintenance Medium). Monocytes were allowed to adhere for 2 h, after which the supernatants were discarded and the attached cells were rinsed twice and then incubated in Maintenance Medium overnight at 37 °C in a 57 CO2 environment. The cultured monocytes then were incubated with 10 ng/ml LPS for 2 h and labeled for 60 min in 1 ml of methionine-free RPMI 1640, containing 17 dialyzed FBS, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, and 83 ॖCi/ml [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences; 1000 Ci/mmol). The pulse medium subsequently was discarded, the radiolabeled cells were rinsed once with 2 ml of Chase Medium, and then 1 ml of Chase Medium, with or without a test agent, was added to each well. Where indicated, ATP was added (from a 100 mm stock solution, pH 7.0) to achieve a final concentration of 2 mm. Radiolabeled monocytes were treated with ATP at 37 °C for 3 h after which the medium was recovered and clarified by centrifugation; the resulting supernatants were harvested and adjusted to 17 in Triton X-100, 0.1 mm PMSF, 1 mm iodoacetic acid, 1 ॖg/ml pepstatin, and 1 ॖg/ml leupeptin by addition of concentrated stock solutions of these reagents. Adherent monocytes were solubilized by addition of 1 ml of an extraction buffer composed of 25 mmHepes, 17 Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mmPMSF, 1 mm iodoacetic acid, 1 ॖg/ml pepstatin, 1 ॖg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mg/ml ovalbumin, pH 7.0; 50 ॖl of this extraction buffer also was added to the pellets obtained after clarification of the media supernatants, and these samples were combined with their corresponding cell extracts. After a 30-min incubation on ice, both the media and cell extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 45,000 rpm for 30 min. For the ELISA-based assay, 2 × 105 mononuclear cells were seeded into each well of 96-well plates in a total volume of 0.1 ml. Monocytes were allowed to adhere for 2 h, after which the supernatants were discarded and the attached cells were rinsed twice and then incubated in Maintenance Medium overnight at 37 °C in a 57 CO2 environment. These cultured monocytes were activated with 10 ng/ml LPS for 2 h after which the activation medium was removed, the cells were rinsed twice with 0.1 ml of Chase Medium, and then 0.1 ml of Chase Medium containing a test agent was added and the plate was incubated for 30 min; each test agent concentration was evaluated in triplicate wells. ATP then was introduced (from a 100 mm stock solution, pH 7.0) to achieve a final concentration of 2 mm, and the plate was incubated at 37 °C for an additional 3 h. Media were harvested and clarified by centrifugation, and their IL-1औ content was determined by ELISA (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). THP-1 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) and activated with 200 ng/ml LPS for 2 h. These activated cells (5 × 108 cells) then were incubated with 10 ॖm [14C]CRID 1 in 100 ml of hypotonic medium (27 mm NaCl, 0.9 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.53 mm KCl, 0.29 mm KH2PO4, 20 mm Hepes, 5 mm glucose, 5 mm NaHCO3, 10 ng/ml LPS, pH 7.0) as a suspension culture for 60 min at 37 °C, after which the cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and suspended in 50 ml of 25 mmHepes, 30 mm KCl, 30 mm sodium gluconate, 0.9 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1 ॖg/ml leupeptin, 1 ॖg/ml pepstatin, pH 7.0. This suspension was subjected to nitrogen cavitation (650 p.s.i. for 15 min), and the resulting lysate was clarified by ultracentrifugation. The supernatant was recovered and applied to an anion exchange resin (10-ml HiTrap Q column; Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 20 mm Tris, 20 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 1 ॖg/ml pepstatin, and 1 ॖg/ml leupeptin, pH 8.0, and bound proteins were eluted with a linear 200-ml gradient from 20 to 250 mm NaCl. An aliquot of each fraction was monitored by liquid scintillation counting, and peak fractions were pooled and concentrated; their polypeptide content subsequently was assessed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Under the conditions used, the 31-kDa radiolabeled polypeptide failed to bind to the anion exchanger and was recovered in the flow-through (Fig. 3). In contrast, the 32- and 56-kDa species bound to the column and were eluted at distinct regions of the NaCl gradient (Fig. 3). The radiolabeled 32-kDa polypeptide co-migrated with a discrete Coomassie Blue staining polypeptide and was excised from the gel and analyzed. The 31-kDa polypeptide, however, required additional purification. Material that ran through the anion exchange column was fractionated on a Superose 12 HR 10/30 column, and the 31-kDa polypeptide was eluted from this sizing column as a single peak. When analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and autoradiography, this peak was found to contain a single radiolabeled polypeptide that corresponded to a distinct Coomassie Blue staining polypeptide (data not shown). This was excised from the dried gel and analyzed. The 56-kDa enriched peak from the anion exchange column was dialyzed overnight against 20 mmsodium phosphate, 20 mm NaCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 ॖg/ml pepstatin/leupeptin, pH 6.0, and then fractionated on a HiTrap SP column (5 ml). A linear gradient of NaCl (from 20 to 500 mm) was applied to the column, and a single radioactive peak was eluted. Fractions comprising this peak were pooled and concentrated by Centricon YM-30 centrifugation. This concentrate then was applied to the Superose 12 column. Again, a single peak of radioactivity was observed. Fractions within this peak were pooled, concentrated by Centricon YM-30 centrifugation, and fractionated by SDS-PAGE. Following autoradiography, the Coomassie Blue staining polypeptide corresponding to the radiolabeled 56-kDa species was excised for sequence analysis by digestion and LC-MS. Thiopropyl-Sepharose (7 g;Amersham Biosciences) initially was suspended in buffer (10 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0) containing 50 mm DTT to generate free sulfhydryl groups. The activated resin then was washed to remove DTT and suspended in 70 ml of 10 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, pH 9.3, containing 120 mg of CRID 2; to allow success of the coupling to be monitored, a small amount of [14C]CRID 2 was added to the reaction mixture. After a 16-h incubation at 4 °C, the resin was recovered and washed extensively with 10 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm DTT, pH 7.0. Next, the resin was washed free of DTT and treated with 14 mmN-ethylmaleimide in 0.1 m sodium bicarbonate, 100 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, for 30 min at room temperature to cap unreacted free sulfhydryl groups. Following this step, the resin was washed extensively with 50 mm Tris, 5 mm DTT, pH 7.0. A 10-ml column of the resin was employed for the purification of T"

It is becoming increasingly clear that the Neanderthals and their modern human successors did not mix and that the Neanderthals are an extinct side branch of humanity. Yet, as [Klein][1] explains in his Perspective, it remains unclear why they disappeared shortly after modern humans arrived in Europe and west Asia. Archaeological studies show that Neanderthals shared many advanced behaviors with modern humans, but that they were not as culturally advanced. Neither archaeology nor fossils can reveal Neanderthal cognitive capacity, but genetic studies may shed light on whether the demise of the Neanderthals can be attributed to limited cognitive ability.

We propose that excitation of vibrational overtones of H2SO4 and its hydrate in the near-infrared and visible leads to photolysis, forming sulfur trioxide (SO3) and water. On the basis of absorption cross sections calculated with ab initio methods calibrated to experimental measurements, we estimated J values that are sufficient to explain stratospheric and mesospheric sulfur dioxide (SO2) concentrations and the observation of the sulfate layer."
https://openalex.org/W1993753481,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder with no effective protective treatment, characterized by a massive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SNpc) and the subsequent loss of their projecting nerve fibers in the striatum. To elucidate PD pathogenic factors, and thus to develop therapeutic strategies, a murine PD model based on the administration of the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) has been used extensively. It has been demonstrated that activated microglia cells actively participate in the pathogenesis of MPTP-induced PD through the release of cytotoxic factors. Because current treatments for PD are not effective, considerable research focused lately on a number of regulatory molecules termed microglia-deactivating factors. Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), a neuropeptide with a potent anti-inflammatory effect, has been found to be protective in several inflammatory disorders. This study investigates the putative protective effect of VIP in the MPTP model for PD. VIP treatment significantly decreases MPTP-induced dopaminergic neuronal loss in SNpc and nigrostriatal nerve-fiber loss. VIP prevents MPTP-induced activation of microglia in SNpc and striatum and the expression of the cytotoxic mediators, iNOS, interleukin 1beta, and numor necrosis factor alpha. VIP emerges as a potential valuable neuroprotective agent for the treatment of pathologic conditions in the central nervous system, such as PD, where inflammation-induced neurodegeneration occurs."
https://openalex.org/W1991169541,"A critical role is traditionally assigned to transition states (TSs) and minimum energy pathways, or intrinsic reaction coordinates (IRCs), in interpreting organic reactivity. Such an interpretation, however, ignores vibrational and kinetic energy effects of finite temperature. Recently it has been shown that reactions do not necessarily follow the intermediates along the IRC. We report here molecular dynamics (MD) simulations that show that dynamics effects may alter chemical reactions even more. In the heterolysis rearrangement of protonated pinacolyl alcohol Me 3 C-CHMe-OH 2 + (Me, methyl), the MD pathway involves a stepwise route with C-O bond cleavage followed by methyl group migration, whereas the IRC pathway suggests a concerted mechanism. Dynamics effects may lead to new interpretations of organic reactivity."

Induced in Y1 cells at an early stage of ACTH stimulation, it regulated the initial steps of steroidogenesis. Here we report the identification of its isoform SIK2. When a green fluorescent protein-fused SIK2 was expressed in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, it was mostly present in the cytoplasm. When coexpressed in cAMP-responsive element-reporter assay systems, SIK2 could repress the cAMP-responsive element-dependent transcription, although the degree of repression seemed weaker than that by SIK1. SIK2 was specifically expressed in adipose tissues. When 3T3-L1 cells were treated with the adipose differentiation mixture, SIK2 mRNA was induced within 1 h, the time of induction almost coinciding with that of c/EBPβ mRNA. Coexpressed with human insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) in COS cells, SIK2 could phosphorylate Ser794 of human IRS-1. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of SIK2 in adipocytes elevated the level of phosphorylation at Ser789, the mouse equivalent of human Ser794. Moreover, the activity and content of SIK2 were elevated in white adipose tissues ofdb/db diabetic mice.

Molecular identification of several protein kinases responsible for the serine phosphorylation of IRS proteins has been reported (12–24). Salt-inducible kinase (SIK) was first cloned from the adrenal glands of rats fed a high salt diet (25Halder S.K. Takemori H. Hatano O. Nonaka Y. Wada A. Okamoto M.

It is a serine/threonine protein kinase that belongs to a sucrose-nonfermenting-1 protein kinase/AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) family. It was induced in adrenocortical cells at a very early phase of ACTH stimulation, and its molecular properties have been investigated in detail (27Lin X. Takemori H. Katoh Y. Doi J. Horike N.

Doi J. Horike N. Makino A. Nonaka Y. Okamoto M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1264-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Examining the genomic data base, we noticed the presence of an isoform of SIK. A cDNA clone of the isoform was isolated; the newly identified enzyme was named SIK2, and the previously reported isoform was renamed SIK1. We demonstrate here that SIK2 was abundantly expressed in adipose tissues and was induced at a very early stage during the process of preadipocyte-adipocyte differentiation. When expressed together with human IRS-1 in COS-7 cells, it phosphorylated Ser794 of human IRS-1. Moreover, its activity and content in white adipose tissues of diabetic animals were elevated. Male ddY, C57BL/6Cr, and C57BLKs/Jdb/db (30Lee G.H. Proenca R. Montez J.M. Carroll K.M. Darvishzadeh J.G. Lee J.I. Friedman J.M. Nature. 1996; 379: 632-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (2112) Google Scholar) mice (10 weeks old) were purchased from SLC Co. Ltd. (Shizuoka, Japan) and maintained under standard conditions of light and temperature. All experiments were carried out in accordance with guidelines for animal care of Osaka University Medical School. By searching human genome data base GenBankTM/EMBL/DDBJ for SIK homolog, we found that the putative protein kinase KIAA0781 (GenBankTMaccession number AB018324) and SIK1 were rather similar to each other, although the COOH-terminal half of KIAA0781 seemed completely different from SIK1. We examined the chromosomal loci of human SIK1and KIAA0781 genes; the SIK1 gene was found on chromosome 21 (GenBankTM accession numbers AP001046 andAP001047), whereas the KIAA0781 gene was found on chromosome 11 (GenBankTM accession number AP000925), indicating that the two genes were similar but distinct. Because the KIAA0781 protein predicted from the data base lacked its NH2-terminal part, we decided to isolate a full-length cDNA of KIAA0781 protein. However, the available knowledge of expressed human cDNAs was poorer than that of mouse cDNAs. Therefore, a mouse expression tag (EST) clone data base was searched for mouse homologs of the two genes. As the result, a 3′ non-coding cDNA fragment of mouse SIK1 (GenBankTM accession number U11494) and that of mouse KIAA0781 protein (GenBankTM accession number AA880086) were identified. Based on the cDNA structure, a 3′ non-coding region of mouse SIK1 cDNA was amplified by PCR by using primers, 5′-TTGCTCATGCCTGTGTAGTG and 5′-TTCGCCTGTCTGGAGAGTAA. An EST clone containing a 3′ non-coding region of mouse KIAA0781, IMAGE:1230878, was purchased from Invitrogen. By using these cDNA fragments as probes, we found that mouse mRNA for KIAA0781 protein was abundantly expressed in white adipose tissues. Next, we amplified a full-length mouse KIAA0781 protein cDNA with reverse transcription-PCR by using F primer (5′-TTGGATCCATGGTCATGGCGGATGGCCCGAGGCA) and R primer (5′-CTAGGTCTCCCGGGCTAAGCAGCTCACAACCCCATTGTGTTGTGGGTCCACAGC). (The F primer was designed by taking account of the sequence of an EST clone (GenBankTM accession number AV146436), similar to human KIAA0781 protein and having about 300 bp corresponding to the NH2-terminal peptide. In addition, a BamHI site was added to the 5′ terminus of the F primer to make the cloning of cDNA into several expression vectors easier. Based on the termination codon of IMAGE:1230878, we could expect the presence of aBamHI site near the 3′ terminus. So the R primer was designed to have a mutation at the BamHI site without amino acid substitution.) The PCR products were directly cloned into pTarget vector (Promega, Madison, WI), providing five clones that were sequenced. All clones had the same nucleotide sequence and were 88.8 and 54.7% identical to the coding regions of human KIAA0781 protein and rat SIK1, respectively. We named the protein encoded by this cDNA “mouse SIK2” and used it for further study. The amino acid sequence of mouse SIK2 was 91.5% identical to that of human KIAA0781 protein and was 33.5% to that of rat SIK1. To construct vectors for green fluorescence protein (GFP)-tagged SIK2 and glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged SIK2, BamHI-NotI fragments of mouse SIK2 cDNA were cloned into the BamHI-NotI sites of pGFPC (29Takemori H.

Site-directed mutagenesis kits, GeneEditor (Promega), were used with the mutagenic primers, 5′-CGGAGGTGGCTATCATGATAATAGACAAGTCACAGC and 5′-GAAGGCCGCAGAGCTGCAGATACGTCCCTTAC, to produce mutated SIK2s, SIK2(K49M) and SIK2(S587A), respectively. Escherichia coli expression vectors for GST-fused rat IRS-1 peptide (784–793 residues) and a mutated peptide, IRS-1(S789A), were prepared by introducing oligonucleotides into theBamHI/EcoRI site of pGEX-6P3 (Amersham Biosciences). Nucleotide sequences of oligonucleotides used are as follows: for wild-type IRS-1, 5′-GATCCCTTCGTCTCTCTTCAAGCTCTGGACGCCTTG and 5′-AATTCAAGGCGTCCAGAGCTTGAAGAGAGACGAAGG; for IRS-1(S789A), 5′-GATCCCTTCGTCTCTCTTCAGCCTCTGGACGCCTTG and 5′-AATTCAAGGCGTCCAGAGGCTGAAGAGAGACGAAGG. To prepare a mammalian expression vector for human IRS-1, pEBG-hIRS-1, SpeI and NotI sites were created by site-directed mutagenesis in human IRS-1 cDNA at the 5′ and the 3′ termini (13Ogihara T.

The resultant full-length human IRS-1 cDNA was isolated by SpeI andNotI digestion and ligated into theSpeI/NotI site of pEBG vector. A vector for mutated human IRS-1(S794A) was similarly prepared by site-directed mutagenesis by using an oligonucleotide, 5′-CAGCACCTCCGCCTTTCCACTGCTAGCGGTCGCCTTCTCTATGC. cDNA fragments for mouse SREBP-1 and aP2 were amplified by reverse transcription-PCR from mouse adipose RNAs by using the following primers: for SREBP-1, forward (5′-TGGCCCTGTGTGTACTGGTC) and reverse (5′-GCAGCTGCCACGTAGATCTC); and for aP2, forward (5′-CCCCATTGGTCACTCCTACA) and reverse (5′-ATTTCCATCCAGGCCTCTTC). The amplified fragments were cloned into pT7-Blue vector (Novagen, Madison, WI). cDNA probes for c/EBPs and PPARγ were were described previously (32Kurebayashi S. Sumitani S. Kasayama S. Jetten A.M.

A specific antibody to SIK2 was raised against a peptide at the COOH-terminal side (346- 931 residues) in rabbits as described (34Takemori H. Zolotaryov F.N. Ting L. Urbain T. Komatsubara T.

To produce the antigen, a cDNA fragment encoding the above peptide was amplified by PCR with primers, 5′-AAGGATCCGTGGAGCAGAGACTTGATG and 5′-TGCGGCCGCTAGGTCTCCCGGGCTAAG, digested byBamHI/NotI, and cloned into aBamHI/NotI site of pET28a (Novagen). An antibody against phospho-Ser789 of rat IRS-1 was described before (35Qiao L.Y. Zhande R. Jetton T.L. Zhou G. Sun X.J. J. Biol.

Doi J. Okamoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42334-42343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The homogenates were preincubated with 100 μl of protein-G-Sepharose at 4 °C for 30 min to remove nonspecifically bound proteins. The mixture was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 15 min, and the resulting infranatant was recovered, and the protein concentration was determined with Protein Assay (Bio-Rad). The protein solutions, 3 mg obtained from white adipose, 3 mg from brown adipose, 18 mg from liver, or 18 mg from skeletal muscles, were incubated with 10 μl of anti-SIK2-specific antiserum and 50 μl of protein-G-Sepharose at 4 °C for 3 h. The SIK2-IgG-protein-G-Sepharose complex was precipitated by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 5 s, washed three times with 1 ml of lysis buffer, and washed once with 1 ml of SIK-reaction buffer (27Lin X.

The final precipitate was suspended in the SIK-reaction buffer with a final volume of 50 μl. Two aliquots of the SIK2-IgG suspension were used for the immunoblot analysis and in vitro kinase assay. To prepare the samples from cultured cells, fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer, and aliquots of the lysate were incubated with anti-IRS-1 antibody (5 μl), anti-phospho-Ser789 IRS-1 antiserum (10 μl), or anti-SIK2 antiserum (10 μl) in the presence of 50 μl of protein-A-Sepharose for 3 h. 3T3L-1 cells, obtained from Japan Health Sciences Foundation, were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Sigma) containing 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics, at 37 °C under an atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air. After reaching confluence, the cells were treated with a differentiation mixture (36Yeh W.C. Cao Z. Classon M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 168-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar), MIX (0.5 mm 3-methyl-1-isobutylxanthine, 1 μg/ml insulin, and 1 μm dexamethasone), in DMEM containing high concentration of glucose (2.5 g/liter). After the 2 days of treatment, the cells were transferred into DMEM containing high glucose, and the medium was changed every 2nd day. COS-7 cells were also maintained in DMEM. For transfection of expression vectors, LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) was used in this study. The phosphorylation of Ser794 in human IRS-1 by SIK2 in COS-7 cells was performed by a method described previously (29Takemori H. Katoh Y. Horike N. Doi J. Okamoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42334-42343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) with some modification. COS-7 cells, after having been transformed with pTarget-SIK2 and pEBG-hIRS-1, were incubated with 32PO4 (0.05 mCi, 1.85 MBq) for 12 h in phosphate/serum-free medium. GST-human IRS-1 expressed in the cells was purified using a glutathione-conjugated column (MicroSpinTM GST Purification Module, Amersham Biosciences) and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. To overexpress SIK2 protein in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, ViraPowerTM adenoviral expression system (Invitrogen) was used. cDNA fragments of wild-type SIK2, SIK2(S587A), and SIK2(K49M) were prepared byBamHI/NotI digestion and ligated into theBamHI/NotI site of pENTR-1A vector (Invitrogen). pAd/CMV/V5-DEST vector and the Gateway system were used to construct adenovirus DNAs. About 1 × 108 plaque-forming units of virus were used for infection of 3T3-L1 adipocytes in 6-cm dishes. Expression of GST-tagged proteins inE. coli and COS-7 cells and their purification was described before (27Lin X. Takemori H. Katoh Y. Doi J. Horike N. Makino A. Nonaka Y. Okamoto M. Mol.

Fig.1A shows the sequence similarity between mouse SIK2 and rat SIK1, highlighting three highly conserved domains. Domain 1, a serine/threonine protein kinase domain, was found near the NH2 terminus of SIK2, at the region 20–271 residues. Amino acid residues in the SIK2 and SIK1 kinase domains were 78% identical to each other. Domain 2, a 54-amino acids stretch, with 70% residues identical between SIK2 and SIK1, was found in the central part of the protein. A computer-assisted data base search (www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Pfam/) revealed that this domain contained a ubiquitin-associate motif, a motif found in several proteins having connections with ubiquitin-dependent intracellular protein degradation. Whether domain 2 plays a role for the intracellular turnover of SIK protein remains to be explored. Domain 3, present one-third from the COOH terminus, contained a protein kinase A-dependently phosphorylatable Ser587, a SIK2 equivalent for Ser577 of SIK1. Full-length SIK2 and SIK1 were expressed as GST-fused proteins in COS-7 cells and purified by using a glutathione-Sepharose column. The purified GST-SIKs were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot analyses using the anti-GST antibody. The expressed GST-SIK2 had an apparent molecular mass of about 150 kDa, the sum of GST and SIK2 (left panel in Fig. 1B). The purified GST-SIK2 was next incubated with GST-Syntide 2 in the presence of 32P-labeled ATP, and the reaction mixture was subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography (right panel in Fig. 1B). Two radioactive bands appeared on an x-ray film, and the band with the lower molecular weight was that of the phosphorylated Syntide 2, whereas that with the higher molecular weight was that of the autophosphorylated SIK2. Lys49 of SIK2, present in the ATP-binding loop (shown in Fig. 1A), is an SIK2 equivalent to Lys56 of SIK1 that was essential for the kinase activity. A mutant SIK2 having Met-49 instead of Lys was assayed for the kinase activity, with the expected results of the mutant being inactive. The similar experiments performed with SIK1 provided the results completely consistent with those reported previously. Our previous study of SIK1 demonstrated that it was present in both nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments of resting Y1 cell, with the higher content in the nucleus (29Takemori H. Katoh Y. Horike N. Doi J. Okamoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42334-42343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Also shown was that when the cells were stimulated with ACTH, Ser577 was protein kinase A-dependently phosphorylated, and the phosphorylated SIK1 was translocated to the cytoplasm. We examined the subcellular distribution of SIK1 and SIK2 by expressing GFP-fused SIKs in 3T3-L1 cells (Fig. 1C). GFP-SIK1, expressed in 3T3-L1 cells, like that expressed in Y1 cells, was mostly present in the nucleus, and the protein was translocated to the cytoplasm after the cells were stimulated with a differentiation mixture (MIX). In contrast, GFP-SIK2 seemed to exist mostly in the cytoplasmic compartment of both resting and stimulated cells, although weak green fluorescence signal could be detected in the nucleus as well. That SIK2 was in fact present in the nucleus was more clearly shown in the cells expressing GFP-SIK2(S587A), whose phosphorylatable Ser587 had been replaced with Ala. SIK1, when coexpressed with CRE-reporter gene in Y1 cells, could repress the PKA-dependently activated reporter activity (28Doi J. Takemori H. Lin X.-Z. Horike N. Katoh Y. Okamoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15629-15637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We examined the effect of SIKs on CRE-dependent transcription efficiency in 3T3-L1 cells by using CRE-reporter cotransfection assays. The extent of SIK2-mediated inhibition of the forskolin-dependent activation of CRE-reporter was about 40% weaker (lower panel in Fig.1D), compared with about 80% obtained by SIK1 (upper panel in Fig. 1D). As expected, SIK2(S587A), whose PKA-dependent phosphorylation site had been abolished, could repress the CRE activity more prominently than the wild-type SIK2. The SIK kinase activity was indispensable for this repressive effect, because the enzymatically inactive SIK2(K49M) did not seem to be repressive. The tissue distribution of SIK2 was examined by Northern blot analyses of various tissues taken from 10-week-old ddY mice (Fig.2A). Large amounts of SIK2 transcripts were found in both white adipose and brown adipose tissues, and a little was found in the testis. Two SIK2 mRNA bands, 4 and 6 kb long, were consistently detected; this seemed to result from an alternative splicing. As reported before (27Lin X. Takemori H. Katoh Y. Doi J. Horike N. Makino A. Nonaka Y. Okamoto M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1264-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), SIK1 mRNA was present mainly in adrenal gland and in smaller amounts in ovary, brain, testis, and skeletal muscle in the diminishing order. The high expression of sik2 genes in adipose tissues prompted us to examine the level of SIK2 mRNA during the process of preadipocyte-adipocyte differentiation. Thus, 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were cultured for 4 days in DMEM to attain confluence. Then they were treated with the differentiation mixture to initiate the differentiation. At several time points after the treatment, the cells were harvested to examine mRNA levels of SIK2 and several other adipocyte differentiation markers. As shown in Fig. 2B, SIK2 mRNA was prominently expressed after the first 24-h incubation, and the level remained high until day 7, when the preadipocytes were mostly differentiated into mature adipocytes (judged by oil Red-O staining; data not shown). On the other hand, the level of SIK1 mRNA, although quite lower compared with that of SIK2 (see the difference in film exposure times given in the legend), seemed to rise a little during the first 24 h and remained at the elevated level until day 7. The level of Pref-1 mRNA, a marker of preadipocytes (37Smas C.M. Sul H.S. Cell. 1993; 73: 725-734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar), began to decline after the day 2. The mRNA levels of c/EBPβ and c/EBPδ, transcription factors known to appear early in the adipocyte differentiation (36Yeh W.C. Cao Z. Classon M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 168-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar), rose during the first 24 h in a manner similar to that of SIK2. The mRNA levels of known late response genes of adipogenesis, such as SREBP-1, c/EBPα, PPARγ, and aP2 (38Rosen E.D. Spiegelman B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37731-37734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar,39Soukas A. Socci N.D. Saatkamp B.D. Novelli S. Friedman J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34167-34174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), began to rise after day 2 or day 4. We further examined the expression of mRNAs during the first 12 h after the stimulation (Fig. 2C). The SIK2 mRNA level rose within 1 h after the stimulation, and the elevation almost coincided with that of c/EBPβ mRNA. The elevation of c/EBPδ mRNA level occurred within 1 h as well, but the level gradually declined after a few hours. In order to examine which agent in the mixture of three hormones, insulin, cAMP, and dexamethasone, was required to stimulate the transcription of sik2 gene, the preadipocytes were incubated for 2 h with a single hormone or a mixture of the three, and the mRNA levels were examined (Fig. 2D). The transcription of sik2 gene seemed to be activated by dexamethasone alone to the similar degree as by the mixture, although even insulin alone could also substantially activate the transcription. The above findings strongly suggest that SIK2 may be involved in the signal transduction pathways in adipose tissues. But nothing more could be added to this issue until we could identify the intracellular target molecule(s) of SIK2 action. In our attempt to search for the target molecule, we noticed that several serine/threonine kinases, including AMPK, to whose family SIK2 belongs, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase, are known to play important roles in modulating the insulin-dependent stimulus-response coupling (6White M.F. Diabetologia. 1997; 40 Suppl. 2: 2-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 7Saltiel A.R. Cell. 2001; 104: 517-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Therefore, we surmised that the target molecules(s) of SIK2 might be found somewhere in the insulin-stimulated signaling pathways of adipose tissues. Our in vitro kinase assays using various synthetic peptide substrates suggest that the canonical phosphorylation motif of SIK is (Hy)((B)X orX(B))XX(S/T)XXX(Hy), whereS/T is the phosphorylatable Ser or Thr, and (Hy) and (B) are hydrophobic and basic residues, respectively. 2Y. Katoh, H. Takemori, and M. Okamoto, unpublished results. Because a peptide stretch, Leu-Arg-Leu-Ser-Thr-Ser794-Ser-Gly-Arg-Leu, in human IRS-1 seemed consistent with the canonical motif, we first tested whether or not several synthetic peptides having sequences similar to this stretch could serve as substrates of E. coli-expressed SIK2. As shown in Fig. 3A, a rat IRS-1-derived peptide (784–793 residues), Leu784-Arg-Leu-Ser-Ser-Ser789-Ser-Gly-Arg-Leu793, was strongly phosphorylated, and the Ser789-disrupted mutant peptide was weakly phosphorylated by SIK2. Because the rat IRS-1 peptide contained four successive serine residues, we surmised that one, or several, of the neighboring three residues, Ser787, Ser788, or Ser790, in the Ser789-disrupted peptide(S789A) might be weakly phosphorylated by SIK2. In any case, this result clearly indicated that Ser789 in rat IRS-1, an equivalent for Ser794in human IRS-1, was a possible candidate for phosphorylation by SIK2in vitro. Next, GST-linked full-length human IRS-1 or its Ser794-disrupted derivative was coexpressed with SIK2 or Lys49-disrupted inactive SIK2 in H332PO4-preincubated COS-7 cells. As seen in the upper panel of Fig. 3B, the wild-type IRS-1 was prominently phosphorylated in the wild-type SIK2-expressed cells, although a weakly phosphorylated IRS-1 was found in the inactive SIK2(K49M)-expressed cells, indicating that IRS-1 could also be phosphorylated in COS-7 cells by a protein kinase(s) other than SIK2. In contrast, the Ser794-disrupted IRS-1 could only weakly, if at all, be phosphorylated in either the wild-type SIK2- or the inactive SIK2-expressed cells. This result suggests that Ser794 in hum"

We report a phenomenon unique to three-dimensional cracks: Locally stronger fault sections, rather than slowing ruptures, drive them forward at velocities exceeding the shear wave speed. This supershear mechanism differentiates barrier and asperity models of fault heterogeneity, which previously have been regarded as indistinguishable. High strength barriers concentrate energy, producing potentially destructive pulses of strong ground motion."

The aim of our study was to determine gene-protein pathways of the antioxidants, dopamine (DA), R-apomorphine (R-APO), melatonin, and green tea polyphenol (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), in neuroblastoma cells, using a customized cDNA microarray and quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction gene expression techniques. We demonstrate a concentration-dependent correlation between these compounds and modulation of cell survival/cell death-related gene pathways. High toxic concentration of DA (500 microM), R-APO (50 microM), melatonin (50 microM), and EGCG (50 microM) exhibited a similar profile of proapoptotic gene expression, increasing the level of bax, caspase-6, fas ligand, and the cell-cycle inhibitor gadd45 genes, while decreasing antiapoptotic bcl-2 and bcl-xL. Conversely, the low neuroprotective concentrations (1-10 microM) of these compounds induced an antiapoptotic response. Melatonin displayed an extremely low index of mortality, which may be partially explained by the observation that a high concentration did not significantly affect the expression of mitochondrial Bcl-2 family members, bcl-2 and bax. Protein analysis of Bcl-2, Bax, and activated caspase-3 correlated with the gene expression pattern. Our results provide for the first time new insights into the molecular events involved in the dose-dependent neuroprotective and neurotoxic activities of catechols and indole amine compounds."
https://openalex.org/W1974341306,"Bcl-2 family proteins are important regulators of apoptosis. They can be pro-apoptotic (e.g. Bid, Bax, and Bak) or anti-apoptotic (e.g. Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL). The current study examined Bid-induced apoptosis and its inhibition by Bcl-2. Transfection of Bid led to apoptosis in HeLa cells. In these cells, Bid was processed into active forms of truncated Bid or tBid. Following processing, tBid translocated to the membrane-bound organellar fraction. Bcl-2 co-transfection inhibited Bid-induced apoptosis but did not prevent Bid processing or tBid translocation. On the other hand, Bcl-2 blocked the release of mitochondrial cytochromec in Bid-transfected cells, suggesting actions at the mitochondrial level. Alkaline treatment stripped off tBid from the membrane-bound organellar fraction of Bid plus Bcl-2-co-transfected cells, but not from cells transfected with only Bid, suggesting inhibition of tBid insertion into mitochondrial membranes by Bcl-2. Bcl-2 also prevented Bid-induced Bax translocation from cytosol to the membrane-bound organellar fraction. Finally, Bcl-2 diminished Bid-induced oligomerization of Bax and Bak within the membrane-bound organellar fraction, shown by cross-linking experiments. In conclusion, Bcl-2 inhibited Bid-induced apoptosis at the mitochondrial level by blocking cytochrome c release, without suppressing Bid processing or activation. Critical steps blocked by Bcl-2 included tBid insertion, Bax translocation, and Bax/Bak oligomerization in the mitochondrial membranes. Bcl-2 family proteins are important regulators of apoptosis.

For example, anti-apoptotic members, like Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, contain four BH domains, whereas some pro-apoptotic molecules such as Bax and Bak contain three (BH1–3), and others contain only one, the BH3 domain (7Martinou J.C.

Unlike others, Bid activation depends on the proteolytic processing of intact Bid into truncated forms of tBid. tBid, thus generated, translocates to mitochondria and leads to disruption of the organelles and the release of apoptogenic molecules such as cytochrome c (14Luo X.

Recent studies (19Wei M.C. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A.J. Roth K.A. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J.

Despite these important observations, it remains unclear how Bcl-2 antagonizes the pro-apoptotic action of Bid or tBid (20Esposti M.D. Apoptosis. 2002; 7: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 21Yin X.M.

Our results show that Bcl-2 inhibited Bid-induced cytochrome c release and apoptosis, without suppressing Bid processing into tBid and subsequent tBid translocation to mitochondria. At the mitochondria, three critical events that were blocked by Bcl-2 have been identified. First, Bcl-2 suppressed tBid insertion into mitochondrial membranes. Second, Bcl-2 inhibited Bid-induced Bax translocation from the cytosol to mitochondria. Third, Bcl-2 diminished Bid-induced Bax/Bak oligomerization in the mitochondrial membranes. The results suggest that Bcl-2 may suppress Bid-induced apoptosis at the mitochondrial level by multiple mechanisms. PcDNA-Bid was prepared as described previously (13Wang K. Yin X.M. Chao D.T.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2859-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). pऔactBcl-2 was a gift from Dr. Junyin Yuan at Harvard Medical School. pEGFP was purchased from Clontech. Transfection reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. Chemical cross-linkers dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate (DSP), bismaleimidohexane (BMH), and bis[2-(succinimidyloxycarbonyloxy)-ethyl] sulfone (BSOCOES) were purchased from Pierce. Antibodies used in this study were from the following sources: rabbit polyclonal anti-Bax (N-20), mouse monoclonal anti-Bcl-2 (C-2), rabbit polyclonal anti-Bcl-2 (ΔC21), and goat polyclonal anti-lamin B from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); rabbit polyclonal anti-Bak from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.

All secondary antibodies were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). HeLa cells were maintained in minimum essential medium supplemented with 107 fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mm non-essential amino acids, 2 mml-glutamine, and 17 antibiotics. The cells were plated at 3.0 × 105/35-mm dish to reach ∼507 confluence by the next day for transfection. Cells in each dish were transfected with 0.25 ॖg of empty pcDNA vectors, 0.25 ॖg of pcDNA-Bid, or 0.25 ॖg of pcDNA-Bid along with 0.25 ॖg of pऔactBcl-2. To identify the transfectants, the same dishes were co-transfected with pEGFP-C1, which led to the expression of green fluorescence protein in transfected cells. Transfection was facilitated with LipofectAMINE PLUS (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfection efficacy was usually over 707. After transfection, cells were incubated in serum-free medium for 4–5 h and then transferred to full growth medium. Morphological and biochemical analyses were conducted at ∼17 h post-transfection. Apoptotic cells were identified by their morphology as described in our previous studies (22Dong Z. Venkatachalam M.A. Wang J. Patel Y. Saikumar P. Semenza G.L. Force T. Nishiyama J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18702-18709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Typical apoptotic morphology evaluated included cellular shrinkage and the formation of apoptotic bodies. To verify apoptosis, nucleus was stained with Hoechst 33342 to reveal nuclear condensation and fragmentation. For each condition, apoptosis was monitored in five fields with ∼60 cells per field. The experiments were repeated for at least four times with duplicate dishes for each condition in every experiment. To analyze the distributions of various proteins, cells were fractionated into cytosolic and membrane-bound organellar fractions with low concentrations of digitonin (23Dong Z. Saikumar P. Patel Y. Weinberg J.M. Venkatachalam M.A. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 669-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 24Saikumar P. Dong Z. Patel Y. Hall K. Hopfer U. Weinberg J.M.

Digitonin permeabilization has been used to study protein redistributions within cells during apoptosis (24Saikumar P. Dong Z. Patel Y. Hall K. Hopfer U. Weinberg J.M.

Briefly, cells were exposed to 0.057 digitonin in isotonic sucrose buffer (in mm: 250 sucrose, 10 Hepes, 10 KCl, 1.5 MgCl2, 1 EDTA, and 1 EGTA; pH 7.1) for 2 min at room temperature to collect the soluble fraction as cytosolic extracts. Digitonin-insoluble fraction was washed with isotonic sucrose buffer and further dissolved in 27 SDS buffer to collect the membrane-bound organellar fraction. Because apoptotic redistribution of cytochromec and Bcl-2 family proteins including Bid and Bax mainly takes place between the cytosol and mitochondria, immunoblot analysis of the membrane-bound part is expected to reveal mitochondrial content of the molecules. Cross-linking was conducted by procedures modified from our previous work (25Mikhailov V. Mikhailova M. Pulkrabek D.J. Dong Z. Venkatachalam M.A. Saikumar P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18361-18374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). All cross-linking chemicals (DSP, BMH, and BSOCOES) were dissolved in Me2SO at concentrations of 100 mm prior to experiments and further diluted in phosphate-buffered saline to 10 mmbefore using. DSP was added to the cells for 30 min of incubation at room temperature under constant mixing. The cells were subsequently fractionated by digitonin as described above. For BMH and BSOCOES, cells were first fractionated to collect the membrane fraction for cross-linking. Cross-linked samples were subjected to electrophoresis under non-reducing conditions for immunoblot analysis. Cytochromec immunofluorescence was examined as described in our previous publications (23Dong Z. Saikumar P. Patel Y. Weinberg J.M. Venkatachalam M.A. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 669-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 24Saikumar P. Dong Z. Patel Y. Hall K. Hopfer U. Weinberg J.M. Venkatachalam M.A. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3401-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown on collagen-coated glass coverslips and subjected to transfection. The cells were fixed in a modified Zamboni's fixative containing 47 paraformaldehyde and 0.197 picric acid and permeabilized with 0.17 SDS prior to blocking and primary antibody (mouse anti-native cytochrome c) exposure. Finally, antigenic sites within the cells were revealed by staining with CY-3-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies. To examine the nucleus, Hoechst 33342 (10 ॖg/ml) was added to cells in phosphate-buffered saline and stained for 5 min at room temperature. After digitonin permeabilization, the membrane-bound organellar fraction was collected and washed once with phosphate-buffered saline. The fraction was incubated on ice in 0.1m Na2CO3 at pH 11.5 for 30 min and then subjected to 1 h of centrifugation at 100,000 ×g at 4 °C to collect the supernatant and pellet. The supernatant contained the proteins released during alkaline incubation, whereas the pellet contained the proteins that were resistant to the treatment (28Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar). Cells were extracted directly with RIPA buffer to collect whole cell lysate, or subjected to sequential extractions with 0.057 digitonin and RIPA buffer to collect cytosolic and membrane-bound organellar extracts, respectively. Isotonic digitonin buffer was described above under “Subcellular Fractionation.” The composition of RIPA buffer was (in mm): 150 NaCl, 1 MgCl2, 1 EGTA, 10 औ-mercaptoethanol, 15 Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.57 sodium deoxycholate, 0.27 SDS, and 17 Triton X-100. Immunoprecipitation was conducted according to our previous work (24Saikumar P. Dong Z. Patel Y. Hall K. Hopfer U. Weinberg J.M. Venkatachalam M.A. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3401-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 25Mikhailov V. Mikhailova M. Pulkrabek D.J. Dong Z. Venkatachalam M.A. Saikumar P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18361-18374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Extracts (whole cell extracts by RIPA, cytosolic extracts by digitonin, post-digitonin extracts by RIPA) from ∼1 × 106 cells were pre-cleared by incubation with 1 ॖg of normal serum and 30 ॖl of agarose protein A/G (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The pre-cleared lysates were subsequently incubated for 2 h with 2 ॖg of immunoprecipitation antibody and 30 ॖl of agarose protein A/G. Immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation and dissolved in SDS sample buffer for immunoblot analysis. To detect Bcl-2 and Bid/tBid interaction, a mouse monoclonal anti-Bcl-2 was used for immunoprecipitation, and the resultant precipitates were subjected to immunoblot analysis of Bid/tBid. We initially determined whether transfection of full-length Bid induced apoptosis in HeLa cells and whether Bcl-2 co-transfection was able to suppress it. To identify the transfected cells, a vector containing green fluorescence protein (GFP) was co-transfected. The results are shown in Fig. 1A. The control group that was transfected with empty vectors had an apoptosis rate of 22.87. Bid transfection led to a dramatic increase in apoptosis, to 81.37. Bid-induced apoptosis was blocked by Bcl-2 co-transfection. As a result, cells co-transfected with Bid + Bcl-2 showed an apoptosis rate of 33.77 (Fig. 1A). The morphological observations were confirmed by biochemical analyses. As shown in Fig. 1B, Bid transfection led to the cleavage of lamin B into an apoptosis-indicative fragment of 46 kDa (lane 2). Co-transfection of Bcl-2 blocked lamin B cleavage (lane 3). Data not shown also demonstrated apoptotic cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase in Bid-only transfected cells, which was again suppressed by Bcl-2 co-transfection. Together, these experiments have demonstrated Bcl-2 inhibition of Bid-induced apoptosis in HeLa cells. A major cellular site targeted by Bcl-2 family proteins is the mitochondrion (7Martinou J.C. Green D.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar, 8Adams J.M. Cory S.

Cell Res. 2000; 256: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Disruption of this organelle results in the release of apoptogenic molecules including cytochromec and may therefore underlie the pro-apoptotic actions of Bid (20Esposti M.D. Apoptosis. 2002; 7: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 21Yin X.M. Cell Res. 2000; 10: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Thus, to pursue the mechanisms responsible for Bcl-2 inhibition of Bid-induced apoptosis, we examined cellular distributions of cytochrome c. The results are shown in Fig.2. By immunoblot analyses, the majority of cytochrome c was detected in the mitochondrial fraction of the control cells (Fig. 2A, lane 1). Bid transfection led to an increase of cytochrome c in the cytosol, accompanied by loss of the molecule from the membrane-bound organellar fraction (lane 2), indicating cytochromec release from mitochondria in these cells. Significantly, Bcl-2 co-transfection blocked Bid-induced cytochrome crelease (lane 3). The immunoblot results were confirmed by immunofluorescence staining of cytochrome c within these cells. As shown in Fig. 2B, Bid-transfected cells (a, green) exhibited typical morphology of apoptosis, assuming a round-up and fragmented configuration. In the same cells, cytochrome c (Fig. 2B, b,red) was released from mitochondria, resulting in whole cell staining. In sharp contrast, cells co-transfected with Bid + Bcl-2 displayed a much healthier morphology (Fig. 2B,c). These cells maintained cytochrome c in the mitochondria, showing a punctated perinuclear staining (Fig.2B, d). The results suggest that Bcl-2 inhibited Bid-induced apoptosis at the mitochondrial level by blocking cytochromec leakage from mitochondria. The pro-apoptotic activity of Bid depends on its processing into the active forms of tBid (14Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3080) Google Scholar, 15Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3790) Google Scholar). Thus, to identify further the mechanisms responsible for Bcl-2 inhibition, we examined Bid processing in transfected cells and the effects of Bcl-2 co-transfection by using whole cell lysates. The results are shown in Fig. 3. In Bid-transfected cells, intact Bid of 22 kDa was expressed at high levels (lane 2), compared with control transfection (lane 1). Moreover, tBid of 15 and 13 kDa was detected, indicating Bid processing in these cells (lane 2). Bcl-2 co-transfection did not attenuate either Bid expression or it processing into tBid (lane 3). The results suggest that Bcl-2 inhibited Bid-induced apoptosis without significantly suppressing Bid expression or processing. An important event for Bid activation and toxicity is the targeting of mitochondria by tBid (14Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3080) Google Scholar, 15Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3790) Google Scholar). Thus, our subsequent experiments tested the possibility that Bcl-2 might inhibit Bid-induced apoptosis by blocking tBid translocation. For this purpose, transfected cells were fractionated into cytosolic and membrane-bound organellar fractions for immunoblot analysis of Bid/tBid. The results are shown in Fig. 4. In Bid-only transfected cells (lanes 1 and 3), intact Bid of 22 kDa was detected mainly in the cytosol, whereas tBid of 15 kDa showed both cytosolic and organellar distributions, and p13 was detected only in the membrane-bound organellar fraction. Bcl-2 co-transfection did not change the cellular localization of these molecules (Fig. 4,lanes 2 and 4). The results, together with those shown in Fig. 3, indicate that Bcl-2 inhibited Bid-induced cytochromec leakage and apoptosis without blocking Bid processing and translocation. Bcl-2 did not affect Bid processing into tBid or tBid translocation (Figs. 3 and4). However, it inhibited Bid-induced mitochondrial disruption including the release of cytochrome c (Fig. 2). These observations promoted us to examine the status of tBid association with mitochondrial membranes. Specifically, we asked the following: does Bcl-2 prevent tBid integration or insertion into the membranes? To address this question, we utilized a classical method of alkaline treatment to examine the integration status of tBid (28Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar). Alkaline incubation of cellular membranes at pH 11.5 leads to the dissociation of loosely attached proteins, whereas integrated proteins remain. This approach was successfully employed to demonstrate Bax insertion into mitochondria (29Eskes R. Desagher S. Antonsson B. Martinou J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 929-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar, 30Goping I.S. Gross A. Lavoie J.N. Nguyen M. Jemmerson R. Roth K. Korsmeyer S.J. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). In our experiments, cells were transfected with Bid alone or Bid + Bcl-2. Membrane-bound organellar fractions were collected for incubation with 0.1 m NaHCO3 at pH 11.5. Proteins stripped into the incubation solution were collected and analyzed for Bid/tBid, along with the proteins that were resistant to alkaline incubation. The results are shown in Fig.5. In Bid-only transfected cells, alkaline incubation stripped off intact Bid of 22 kDa from the organellar membranes into the supernatant (lane S1). However, tBid of 15 and 13 kDa was rather resistant to the treatment and thus remained associated with the membranes after alkaline exposure (lane P1), suggesting that tBid and not intact Bid had integrated into the mitochondrial membranes in these cells. In sharp contrast, for Bid + Bcl-2-co-transfected cells, alkaline treatment led to the release of not only intact Bid but also a significant portion of 15-kDa tBid (lane S2). To estimate the percentage of 15-kDa tBid that was sensitive to alkaline treatment, blots from 4 separate experiments were analyzed by densitometry (Fig. 5B). In cells co-transfected with Bcl-2, over 307 of 15-kDa tBid was released during alkaline incubation; by sharp contrast, less than 27 was released from cells transfected with Bid only. As a control, cytochrome oxidase IV, an integral mitochondrial membrane protein, was not stripped off from the membranes under these experimental conditions, regardless of the presence or absence of Bcl-2 (Fig. 5A,lower panel). The results suggest that Bcl-2 may suppress Bid-induced mitochondrial disruption partly by prevention of tBid insertion into the organellar membranes. Our results suggested that Bcl-2 inhibited tBid insertion into mitochondrial membranes (Fig. 5). However, the underlying mechanism was unclear. One hypothesis was that Bcl-2 might directly interact with tBid, resulting in conformational changes in this molecule that prevented its integration into organellar membranes. To test this possibility, we examined the interactions between Bcl-2 and Bid/tBid by co-immunoprecipitation. In this experiment, cells were extracted either directly with RIPA buffer to collect whole cell lysate or sequentially with digitonin and RIPA buffer to collect the cytosolic fraction and the membrane-bound organellar fraction including mitochondria. The extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation with Bcl-2 antibodies. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed for the presence of Bid and tBid. As shown in Fig. 6A, intact Bid was detected in all Bcl-2 immunoprecipitates, irrespective of the extracts utilized for immunoprecipitation. On the contrary, tBid was not shown in any of the Bcl-2 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 6A). To demonstrate that the extracts prior to immunoprecipitation did contain tBid,"

It endonucleolytically makes a nick immediately adjacent to 5′ of an apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site and generates a hydroxyl group at the 3′ terminus upstream of the nick and a 5′-deoxyribose phosphate moiety downstream (6Wilson III, D.M.

DNA polymerase β further processes the product of APE1 by inserting a nucleotide into the gap and releasing the 5′-deoxyribose phosphate by its intrinsic lyase activity (7Matsumoto Y. Kim K.

Bivins C. Jolivet J. Kantarjian H.M. J. Clin. Oncol. 2002; 20: 656-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The incorporation of l-OddC into DNA terminates DNA chain elongation because of the lack of the 3′-hydroxyl group on the sugar moiety of l-OddC. The cytotoxicity ofl-OddC is proportional to the amount of l-OddC in DNA, suggesting that the mechanism of action of l-OddC is to stop DNA replication. Therefore, the exonuclease activity of APE1 may play a critical role in determining the cytotoxicity ofl-OddC (15Grove K.L. Cheng Y.C. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4187-4191PubMed Google Scholar). We also discovered that APE1 has a significant preference for the removal of mispaired nucleotides from the 3′ terminus of DNA when compared with matched pairs (16Chou K.M. Cheng Y.C. Nature. 2002; 415: 655-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Because physical interaction between polymerase β and APE1 had been established (17Bennett R.A. Wilson III, D.M. Wong D. Demple B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7166-7169Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) and APE1 showed a significant preference for 3′ mispaired nicked DNA (16Chou K.M. Cheng Y.C. Nature. 2002; 415: 655-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), APE1 could be the proofreading enzyme correcting the misincorporations introduced by DNA polymerase β (16Chou K.M. Cheng Y.C. Nature. 2002; 415: 655-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar).In addition to its DNA repair activities, APE1 was shown to possess redox activity, which regulates the DNA binding of a number of transcription factors, including Jun and Fos (18Xanthoudakis S. Miao G. Wang F. Pan Y.C. Curran T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3323-3335Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar, 19Xanthoudakis S. Curran T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 653-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). The redox activity of APE1 resides in the N-terminal region (5Xanthoudakis S. Miao G.G. Curran T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), and cysteine 65 is considered to be the active site (4Walker L.J. Robson C.N. Black E. Gillespie D. Hickson I.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5370-5376Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 20Walker L.J. Craig R.B. Harris A.L. Hickson I.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4884-4889Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Previous reports (4Walker L.J. Robson C.N. Black E. Gillespie D. Hickson I.D. Mol. Cell.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4884-4889Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) indicated that Cys-65 has no impact on the DNA endonuclease activity of APE1. The biological function of this redox activity of APE1 is, however, not well understood.Several groups (21Gorman M.A. Morera S. Rothwell D.G. de La Fortelle E. Mol C.D. Tainer J.A. Hickson I.D.

Biol. 2001; 307: 1023-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) have solved the crystal structure of APE1 in the presence or absence of abasic DNA. Mol et al. (22Mol C.D. Izumi T. Mitra S. Tainer J.A. Nature. 2000; 403: 451-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar) reported the crystal structure of APE1-AP DNA complex and proposed a mechanism of action for the APE1 endonuclease activity in which amino acid Glu-96 binds to a metal ion, His-309/Asp-283 interacts with the phosphate backbone of DNA, and Asp-210 deprotonates a water molecule during nucleophilic attack on the AP site (22Mol C.D. Izumi T. Mitra S. Tainer J.A. Nature. 2000; 403: 451-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Beernink et al. (23Beernink P.T. Segelke B.W. Hadi M.Z. Erzberger J.P. Wilson III, D.M. Rupp B. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 1023-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) subsequently proposed another mechanism of action based on the structure of APE1 crystallized under a neutral pH in the absence of AP DNA. According to the latter model, there are two metal-binding sites in the active center of APE1 endonuclease; Glu-96 is involved in coordinating one metal ion, which stabilizes the O-3′ leaving group (23Beernink P.T. Segelke B.W. Hadi M.Z. Erzberger J.P. Wilson III, D.M. Rupp B. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 1023-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar); and Asp-210 and His-309 coordinate the other metal ion to deprotonate a water molecule, which generates a nucleophile. In both models, Glu-96, Asp-210, and His-309 are involved in endonucleolytic activity of APE1. Mutations at these sites resulted in a significant decrease in endonuclease activity.The monophosphate metabolites of ribonucleosides and several nucleoside analogs have been shown to have inhibitory effects on DNA exonucleases and DNA polymerase-associated exonucleases (24Huang P. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 25Tsurumi T. Virology. 1992; 189: 803-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 26Pelicano H. Kukhanova M. Cheng Y.C. Mol.

In this study, we have characterized the biochemical properties of APE1 including optimal pH, Mg2+ requirements, and kinetic parameters of matched, 3′ mispaired as well as l-OddC terminated DNA. The role of the specific amino acids Cys-65, Glu-96, Asp-210, and His-309 in the exonucleolytic action of APE1 was also examined. In addition, we have examined the potential inhibitory effects of naturally occurring ribonucleosides and deoxyribonucleosides and nucleotides on both exonuclease and endonuclease activities of APE1. Interestingly, among all the nucleosides and nucleotides, the dinucleotide compound Gp4G was the only potent inhibitor of both endonuclease and exonuclease activities of APE1. Gp4G is a product of GTP:GTP guanylyltransferase (28McLennan A.G. Pharmacol. Ther. 2000; 87: 73-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 29Liu J.J. McLennan A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11787-11794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or originates from the low activity of mRNA capping enzymes (30Smith R.E. Furuichi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 485-494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the detailed functions of Gp4G are not well understood in the cell, several Gp4G analogs were synthesized and shown to be substrates for human immunodeficiency virus-reverse transcriptase (30Smith R.E. Furuichi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 485-494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,31Ruth J.L. Cheng Y.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1981; 20: 415-422PubMed Google Scholar). The inhibition of APE1 activities by Gp4G suggests a novel regulatory role of Gp4G for APE1 in cells.DISCUSSIONWe demonstrated previously (12Chou K.M. Kukhanova M. Cheng Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31009-31015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) that APE1 is the major exonuclease that removes the unnatural l-configuration nucleoside analog, l-OddC, as well as other l-nucleoside analogs from DNA. We subsequently discovered that the exonuclease activity of APE1 has a significant preference for the removal of 3′ mispaired nucleotides from DNA over the matched ones (16Chou K.M. Cheng Y.C. Nature. 2002; 415: 655-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Because physical interaction between APE1 and DNA polymerase β has been established, this novel 3′ mispair removal function of APE1 could explain why the mutation rate is lower than expected, given that the error rate of DNA polymerase β is 1 per 4000, and at least 104 abasic sites are generated per cell per day (1Lindahl T. Mutat. Res. 2000; 462: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar).In this report, we have further characterized the biochemical properties of the exonuclease activity of APE1. Several crystal structures of APE1 have been solved in the presence or absence of abasic DNA under different crystallization conditions (21Gorman M.A. Morera S. Rothwell D.G. de La Fortelle E. Mol C.D. Tainer J.A. Hickson I.D. Freemont P.S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6548-6558Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 22Mol C.D. Izumi T. Mitra S. Tainer J.A. Nature. 2000; 403: 451-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar, 23Beernink P.T. Segelke B.W. Hadi M.Z. Erzberger J.P. Wilson III, D.M. Rupp B. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 1023-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Based on the structures, different mechanisms of action were proposed for the endonuclease activity of APE1. The latest crystal structure solved by Beernink et al. (23Beernink P.T. Segelke B.W. Hadi M.Z. Erzberger J.P. Wilson III, D.M. Rupp B. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 1023-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) indicated that there are two divalent ion binding sites in the APE1 active center under neutral pH. Given the fact that the optimal pH for APE1 endonuclease activity is between 6.6 and 8.6 (23Beernink P.T. Segelke B.W. Hadi M.Z. Erzberger J.P. Wilson III, D.M. Rupp B. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 1023-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), the crystal structure solved under neutral pH could be a more favorable conformation during the endonuclease action of the enzymes. However, because the structure was crystallized in the absence of DNA, the structure of APE1 bound to abasic DNA at neutral pH is still not clear. As different structures of APE1 were obtained under different pH, the optimal pH for the exonuclease activity of APE1 was examined and compared with that of the endonuclease activity. The results indicated that pH 7.4 is optimal for the exonuclease activity as well as for the endonuclease activity, and this observation agrees with a previous report (23Beernink P.T. Segelke B.W. Hadi M.Z. Erzberger J.P. Wilson III, D.M. Rupp B. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 1023-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar).Both endonuclease and exonuclease activities require magnesium for the catalytic reactions (12Chou K.M. Kukhanova M. Cheng Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31009-31015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 33Barzilay G. Walker L.J. Robson C.N. Hickson I.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1544-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). At pH 7.5, the optimal magnesium requirement for exonuclease activity (0.1–2 mm) is substantially lower than that of endonuclease (10–15 mm). Interestingly, as shown in Fig. 1c, at a low MgCl2 concentration (2 mm) NaCl could achieve the same endonuclease activity as the higher concentration of MgCl2 (12.5 mm). This suggests that both endonuclease and exonuclease activities of APE1 may have the same MgCl2 requirement; however, the higher MgCl2concentration requirement for the optimal endonuclease activity may not be specific because NaCl can achieve the same activity. The crystal structure showed that the abasic DNA was severely distorted from B-form DNA during the endonuclease action (22Mol C.D. Izumi T. Mitra S. Tainer J.A. Nature. 2000; 403: 451-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Although theKm values of APE1 exonuclease on 3′ mispaired nicked DNA and endonuclease on F-DNA are very similar, despite different MgCl2 concentrations (2 and 12.5 mm, respectively), the structure of nicked DNA is very different from AP-DNA (no strand breakage). Therefore, the higher concentrations of MgCl2 or NaCl may facilitate the enzyme conformation changes to favor its action on F-DNA.The Km of APE1 exonuclease on recessed DNA is about 3-fold higher than on the nicked or F-DNA, which suggested that APE1 could have higher affinity for nicked or F-DNA than the recessed DNA. It also explains the higher efficiency of APE1 in the removal of 3′ mispaired nucleotide from nicked than the recessed DNA (16Chou K.M. Cheng Y.C. Nature. 2002; 415: 655-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), although the kcat values are similar for both substrates. In contrast, the kcat value of exonuclease on the matched DNA is significantly lower than for either 3′ mispaired orl-OddC DNA. These data further support our previous results (16Chou K.M. Cheng Y.C. Nature. 2002; 415: 655-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) that APE1 has a higher efficiency for the removal of 3′ mispaired nucleotides than matched nucleotides from DNA. DNAs withl-OddC at the 3′ terminus were better substrates for the APE1 exonuclease activity as compared with the 3′ mispaired DNAs, because the kcat values are higher than those for the 3′ mispaired DNA on both recessed and nicked DNA. The unnaturall-configuration of l-OddC may cause a distortion in DNA rendering it a more favorable substrate. Under the optimal reaction conditions, F-DNA is the most favorable substrate for APE1, and the kcat value of endonuclease activity was 9- and 6-fold higher than the exonuclease activity on the 3′ mispaired or l-OddC terminated nicked DNA, respectively. More detailed pre-steady-state kinetic parameters are being explored to further the understanding of the interactions between APE1 and various DNA substrates as well as the catalysis of endonuclease and exonuclease cleavage.The crystal structure of APE1 revealed that there is only one active center in APE1 (21Gorman M.A. Morera S. Rothwell D.G. de La Fortelle E. Mol C.D. Tainer J.A. Hickson I.D. Freemont P.S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6548-6558Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 22Mol C.D. Izumi T. Mitra S. Tainer J.A. Nature. 2000; 403: 451-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar, 23Beernink P.T. Segelke B.W. Hadi M.Z. Erzberger J.P. Wilson III, D.M. Rupp B. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 1023-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), although different mechanisms of action for the endonuclease have been proposed. The redox activity of APE1 resides within the N-terminal region, and Cys-65 has been implicated to be the active center (4Walker L.J. Robson C.N. Black E. Gillespie D. Hickson I.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5370-5376Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 5Xanthoudakis S. Miao G.G. Curran T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 19Xanthoudakis S. Curran T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 653-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). The site-directed Cys-65 mutant APE1 protein was shown to possess similar endonuclease activity as wild type (4Walker L.J. Robson C.N. Black E. Gillespie D. Hickson I.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5370-5376Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar,20Walker L.J. Craig R.B. Harris A.L. Hickson I.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4884-4889Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In this report, we further showed that C65A mutant APE1 has similar exonuclease activity as the wild type APE1 on both recessed and nicked 3′ mispaired DNA. These data further support that Cys-65 is not involved in the DNA repair activity of APE1.All the crystal structures of APE1, obtained under various crystallization conditions, indicated that amino acids Glu-96, Asp-210, and His-309 were critical for the endonuclease activity (21Gorman M.A. Morera S. Rothwell D.G. de La Fortelle E. Mol C.D. Tainer J.A. Hickson I.D. Freemont P.S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6548-6558Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 22Mol C.D. Izumi T. Mitra S. Tainer J.A. Nature. 2000; 403: 451-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar, 23Beernink P.T. Segelke B.W. Hadi M.Z. Erzberger J.P. Wilson III, D.M. Rupp B. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 1023-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The site-directed mutagenesis results shown in Table II indicated that mutation of Glu-96 to alanine reduced both exonuclease and endonuclease activities of APE1 significantly (104 and 105, respectively), which suggested that Glu-96 was critical but might have a different impact on the two enzyme activities. The exonuclease activity of E96Q decreased about 230-fold as compared with that of the wild type APE1 (but was ∼35-fold higher than that of E96A), which indicated that the carboxyl group of Glu-96 might be critical for both enzyme activities. Moreover, E96Q endonuclease activity did not require higher MgCl2 concentration. Mobility shift studies using native gel electrophoresis showed the E96Q mutant but not the wild type or other mutant APE1 proteins bound to F-DNA in the presence of magnesium (12.5 mm). To explore whether E96Q APE1 and F-DNA formed covalent bonds, the complexes were boiled in the presence of SDS and electrophoresed on an SDS-PAGE gel. No complexes were observed after electrophoresis (data not shown), which indicated that no covalent bonds formed in the complex. These results suggested that the dissociation of E96Q mutant from its AP endonuclease product is very slow, and Glu-96 is critical in determining thekcat value for APE1 endonuclease activity. Glu-96 was proposed to play important roles in magnesium placement, and the lack of dose dependence for magnesium and the slow dissociation of E96Q from its DNA product suggested that the higher ionic strength requirement for the optimal APE1 endonuclease activity is needed for the enzyme to disassociate from its product.The APE1 D210E mutant protein also showed a significant decrease in both endonuclease and exonuclease activities, although the substituted glutamic acid can provide the same carboxyl group as the aspartic acid. This indicated that steric hindrance has a profound effect on the enzyme reaction. The D210N mutant APE1 showed extremely low exonuclease and endonuclease activities, which supported the critical role of carboxyl group of glutamic acid (35Rothwell D.G. Hang B. Gorman M.A. Freemont P.S. Singer B. Hickson I.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2207-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The H309N mutant showed very low exonuclease and endonuclease activities. Interestingly, the Glu-96 and Asp-210 APE1 mutant proteins, with the exception of E96Q, showed similar magnesium requirement profiles for endonuclease and exonuclease activities as the wild type APE1 on 3′ mispaired recessed DNA, nicked DNA, and F-DNA. We conclude that all the amino acids studied in this report are important for both endonuclease and exonuclease activities of APE1, but their roles in the two reactions may not be identical.AMP and GMP were shown to be inhibitors for a number of DNA polymerase-associated exonuclease activities (24Huang P. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 25Tsurumi T. Virology. 1992; 189: 803-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 26Pelicano H. Kukhanova M. Cheng Y.C. Mol.

Chem. 1981; 256: 8525-8530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here we report that the APE1 endonuclease and exonuclease activities cannot be inhibited by AMP, GMP, and other natural nucleoside or their mono-, di-, and triphosphate metabolites. Interestingly, Gp4G but not Ap4A competitively inhibited both activities of APE1. The intracellular concentration of Gp4G in mammalian cells is not clear yet; however, the physiological concentrations of Gp4G was shown to be in the nanomolar to micromolar range in rat tissues and human blood platelets (40Schluter H. Grobeta I. Bachmann J. Kaufmann R. van der Giet M. Tepel M. Nofer J.R. Assmann G. Karas M. Jankowski J. Zidek W. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 682-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 41Renart M.F. Renart J. Sillero M.A. Sillero A. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 4962-4966Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In addition, the concentrations of Gp4G were in the nanomolar to micromolar ranges in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and E. colicells, depending on the growth condition (37Coste H. Brevet A. Plateau P. Blanquet S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12096-12103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In exponentially growingS. cerevisiae cells, the Gp4G concentration was determined to be 60 nm, whereas after the temperature shift to a non-growing condition, the concentration of Gp4G increased to 1.15 μm (37Coste H. Brevet A. Plateau P. Blanquet S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12096-12103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This implies that the concentration of Gp4G may be higher in nonproliferating tissues in mammals. In Artemia salina, Gp4G comprises as high as 50% of the total nucleotide pool (10 mm) in dormant cysts, which was suggested to serve as a source of purine for DNA synthesis (38Warner A.H. McClean D.K. Dev. Biol. 1968; 18: 278-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). It was also proposed that Gp4G regulates the activity of endoribonuclease VI inArtemia, by alternating its concentration under different developmental stages (39Grau P.P. Heredia C.F. FEBS Lett. 1988; 236: 291-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). An in vitro experiment has shown that Gp4G activates GMP reductase activity in bothArtemia and human erythrocytes at nanomolar concentrations (41Renart M.F. Renart J. Sillero M.A. Sillero A. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 4962-4966Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 42Spector T. Jones T.E. Miller R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2308-2315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Grau et al. (43Grau V.P. Sillero M.A. Sillero A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11848-11851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) proposed a relationship between Gp4G binding capacity and the time of development of rat embryos. It was also suggested that Gp4G might play a role in the regulation of organ perfusion and vascular growth (40Schluter H. Grobeta I. Bachmann J. Kaufmann R. van der Giet M. Tepel M. Nofer J.R.

In each species, two members are identified with a sequence identity of >907 in the basic helix-loop-helix region and ∼407 in the total proteins, respectively. Recently, we have reported that DEC1 is abundantly expressed in colon carcinomas but not in the adjacent normal tissues. The present study was undertaken to extend the expression study of DEC1 and to determine whether DEC1 and DEC2 had similar expression patterns among paired cancer-normal tissues from the colon, lung, and kidney. Without exceptions, DEC1 was markedly higher in the carcinomas, whereas the opposite was true with DEC2. In stable transfectants, tetracycline-induced expression of DEC1 caused proportional decreases in the expression of DEC2. Co-transfection with DEC1 repressed the activity of a DEC2 promoter reporter by as much as 907. The repression was observed with wild type DEC1 but not its DNA binding-defective mutants. Studies with deletion and site-directed mutants located, in the proximal promoter, an E-box motif that supported the DEC1-mediated repression. Disruption of this E-box markedly abolished the ability of the reporter to respond to DEC1. Our findings assign for DEC1 the first target gene that is regulated through direct DNA binding. DEC/STRA/SHARP proteins are highly identical in the DNA binding domain but much more diverse in other areas. DEC1-mediated repression on the expression of DEC2 provides an important mechanism that these transcription factors regulate the cellular function not only by modulating the expression of their target genes but also the expression of members within the same class.

Disruption of this E-box markedly abolished the ability of the reporter to respond to DEC1. Our findings assign for DEC1 the first target gene that is regulated through direct DNA binding. DEC/STRA/SHARP proteins are highly identical in the DNA binding domain but much more diverse in other areas. DEC1-mediated repression on the expression of DEC2 provides an important mechanism that these transcription factors regulate the cellular function not only by modulating the expression of their target genes but also the expression of members within the same class. basic helix-loop-helix helix-loop-helix electrophoretic mobility shift assay reverse transcription The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)1 proteins are intimately associated with developmental events such as cell differentiation and lineage commitment (1Littlewood T.D.

Evan G.I. Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1998: 1-48Google Scholar). Based on sequence alignment and domain analysis, human DEC (differentially expressed in chondrocytes), mouse STRA (stimulated withretinoic acid), and rat SHARP (split and hairy relatedprotein) constitute a new and structurally distinct class of bHLH proteins (7Boudjelal M.

These proteins are distantly related toDrosophila Hairy and E(spl) as well as the mammalian homologues (e.g. HES) with the highest sequence identity (∼407) in the bHLH region (1Littlewood T.D.

Like Hairy/E(spl)/Hes, DEC/STRA/SHARPs contain an orange domain and a proline residue in the DNA binding domain. However, the proline is located 2 residues more toward the NH2 terminus (1Littlewood T.D. Evan G.I. Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1998: 1-48Google Scholar, 8Fujimoto K. Shen M. Noshiro M. Matsubara K. Shingu S. Honda K. Yoshida E. Suardita K. Matsuda Y. Kato Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 164-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Another major structural difference on the functional domains is that DEC/STRA/SHARPs, unlike Hairy/E(Spl)/Hes proteins, lack the COOH-terminal WRPW tetrapeptide motif (13Fisher A.L. Ohsako S. Caudy M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2670-2676Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar).

Two members of DEC/STRA/SHARP proteins are identified in each mammalian species studied with a sequence identity of >907 in the bHLH region and ∼407 in the total proteins, respectively (8Fujimoto K.

They exhibit an overlapping tissue distribution, and their expression is highly elevated in response to environmental stimuli (7Boudjelal M. Taneja R. Matsubara S. Bouillet P. Dollè P. Chambon P.

In rats that undergo seizure induction by kainic acid, the levels of mRNA encoding SHARP1 or -2 are sharply increased within 1 h in the brain (9Rossner M.J. Dörr J. Gass P. Schwab M.H. Nave K.A. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 460-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In cultured human cells, both DEC1 and DEC2 are markedly induced in response to hypoxia (19Miyazaki K. Kawamoto T. Tanimoto K. Nishiyama M. Honda H. Kato Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47014-47021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Co-transfection experiments with promoter reporters have identified functional hypoxia response elements in both DEC1 and DEC2 genes. These elements show high affinity toward hypoxia-inducible factor-1α and -औ, providing a molecular explanation on the co-regulatory phenomena of DEC1 and DEC2 during hypoxia response (19Miyazaki K.

Rapid induction of these proteins in response to environmental stimuli suggests that DEC/STRA/SHARPs are protective against detrimental conditions. In addition to a potential protective role against environmental stimuli, DEC/STRA/SHARPs have been implicated in cell differentiation (7Boudjelal M. Taneja R. Matsubara S. Bouillet P. Dollè P.

Nature. 2002; 419: 841-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). In a cell culture system, mouse STRA13 promotes neuronal but represses mesodermal and endodermal differentiation (7Boudjelal M. Taneja R. Matsubara S. Bouillet P. Dollè P. Chambon P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2052-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Consistent with the inductive effect on neuronal differentiation, rat SHARP proteins are abundantly expressed in a subset of mature neurons (9Rossner M.J. Dörr J. Gass P. Schwab M.H. Nave K.A. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 460-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). DEC1 has recently been shown to promote chondrocyte differentiation at the early and terminal stages (20Shen M. Yoshida E. Yan W. Kawamoto T. Suardita K. Koyano Y. Fujimoto K. Noshiro M. Kato Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50112-50120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). STRA13-deficient mice, although surviving to adulthood, develop autoimmune diseases accompanied by accumulation of spontaneously activated T and B cells (21Sun H. Lu B. Li R.Q. Flavell R.A. Taneja R. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 1040-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In addition, the mouse proteins are recently found to regulate the expression of biological clock regulator Per(22Honma S. Kawamoto T. Takagi Y. Fujimoto K. Sato F. Noshiro M. Kato Y. Honma K. Nature. 2002; 419: 841-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Recently, we and other investigators have recently demonstrated that deregulated cell survival by DEC1 may have oncogenic significance. In paired samples, DEC1 is abundantly expressed in colon carcinomas but not in the adjacent normal tissues (23Li Y. Zhang H. Xie M. Hu M. Ge S. Yang D. Wan Y. Yan B. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 413-422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). High levels of DEC1 transcript are also detected in an array of cancer cell lines derived from a wide range of organs (24Ivanova A.V. Ivanov S.V. Danilkovitch-Miagkova A. Lerman M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15306-15315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Cells that lack the functional tumor suppressor VHL (von Hippel-Lindau) express higher levels of DEC1 (24Ivanova A.V. Ivanov S.V. Danilkovitch-Miagkova A. Lerman M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15306-15315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Forced expression of DEC1 antagonizes serum deprivation-induced apoptosis and selectively inhibits the activation of procaspases (23Li Y. Zhang H. Xie M. Hu M. Ge S. Yang D. Wan Y. Yan B. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 413-422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These findings suggest that overexpression of DEC1 provides cells with an unusual survival mechanism and thus is oncogenic. The present study was undertaken to extend the expression study on DEC1 and to determine whether DEC1 and DEC2 displayed similar expression patterns among paired tumor-normal tissues from the colon, lung, and kidney. Without exceptions, DEC1 was expressed markedly higher in the carcinomas, whereas DEC2 was expressed markedly higher in the adjacent normal tissues. Forced expression of DEC1 sharply decreased the expression of DEC2 and markedly repressed the activity of a DEC2 promoter reporter. Co-transfection experiments with mutant reporters and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) located, in the proximal promoter, an E-box that supports DEC1-mediated repression. These findings provide direct evidence that DEC1 negatively regulates the expression of DEC2, which is largely achieved through direct DNA binding to the E-box in the proximal promoter of DEC2. Tri-reagent, FLAG-cytomegalovirus vector, and anti-FLAG antibody were purchased from Sigma. The goat anti-rabbit-IgG conjugated with alkaline phosphatase or horseradish peroxidase and ECL substrate were from Pierce. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, LipofectAMINE, and the ThermoScript I reverse transcription-coupled PCR kit were from Invitrogen. The Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system and DNA binding buffer were from Promega. Unless otherwise indicated, all other reagents were purchased from Fisher. Samples were collected from patients who underwent surgical resection for histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma. As paired controls, specimens from the adjacent, grossly normal tissues were harvested. The samples (12 pairs) were collected from the colon, kidney, and lung with four pairs from each organ. The age of the patients was between 23 and 68 with seven male and five female. The size of tumors was generally 2–5 cm in diameter, and the degree of differentiation of tumors was moderate or poor as determined by pathological examination. Samples were freshly processed for RNA isolation and protein extraction. Total RNA was isolated with a Tri-reagent as described previously (25Zhang H. LeCluyse E. Liu L. Hu M. Matoney L. Yan B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 368: 14-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). For the preparation of protein extracts, tissues were homogenized in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 17 Triton X-100, 17 sodium deoxycholate, 0.17 SDS, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). The homogenates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min to remove any insoluble precipitates. The protocol of using human pathological tissues was reviewed by the Institutional Review Board. The expression of DEC1 and DEC2 in human tissues and cultured cells was primarily determined by RT-PCR experiments with a ThermoScript I kit. Total RNA (2 ॖg) was subjected to the synthesis of the first strand cDNA with an oligo(dT) primer and a ThermoScript reverse transcriptase. The reactions were incubated initially at 50 °C for 30 min and then at 60 °C for 60 min after additional reverse transcriptase was added. The cDNAs were then subjected to PCR amplification with cycling parameters as follows: 95 °C for 30 s, 52 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 30 or 40 s for a total of 32 cycles. The primers for DEC1 amplification were 5′-GTCTGTGAGTCACTCTTCAG-3′ and 5′-GAGTCTAGTTCTGTTTGAAGG-3′. The primers for DEC2 amplification were 5′-CGCCCATTCAGTCCGACTTGGAT-3′ and 5′-TGGTTGATCAGCTGGACACAC-3′. The primers for औ-actin amplification were 5′-GTACCCTGGCATTGCCGACAGGATG-3′ and 5′-CGCAACTAAGTCATAGTCCGCCTA-3′. The PCR-amplified products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. A cDNA encoding the full-length DEC1 was isolated by a cDNA-trapping method (23Li Y. Zhang H. Xie M. Hu M. Ge S. Yang D. Wan Y. Yan B. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 413-422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Hu M. Yan B. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 266: 233-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Several DEC1 mutant constructs were prepared by PCR with the full-length DEC1 as the template. These mutants had a specific sequence deleted or one or more amino acids substituted. Some of the mutant constructs were prepared with the SPORT vector (the NH2-terminal truncated mutants), whereas others (the COOH-terminal truncated mutants) were prepared with the FLAG vector to facilitate immunodetection. In some cases, a Kozak sequence was introduced for effective translation initiation. The DEC2 promoter reporter was prepared with the pGL3-basic luciferase vector (Promega). Human genomic DNA was isolated from the placenta with a DNA extraction kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. A genomic fragment (−1,888 to +11) was generated by PCR with 5′-AACAGATGAACTGAACGGACCG-3′ and 5′-CCTCAGTGCAGTGTTGAAAGTG-3′. This PCR fragment was ligated to the pGL3 vector. Deletion mutants of this reporter were prepared by endonuclease digestion followed by ligation or PCR. The DEC2 promoter reporter had two E-box motifs that probably interact with DEC1, and the studies with deletion mutants suggested that the E-box in the proximal region supports DEC1-mediated repression. In order to definitively establish such a role, site-directed mutagenesis was performed to substitute two of the six nucleotides. The mutant construct was prepared with a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Complementary oligonucleotides (5′-GATGGTACGTTCCGAACGGGAGCTGGGTGCTGG-3′) were synthesized to target this region. To perform the substitutions, the primers were annealed to a DEC2 promoter reporter and subjected to a thermocycler for a total of 15 cycles. The resultant PCR-amplified constructs were then digested with DpnI to remove the nonmutated parent construct. The mutated PCR-amplified constructs were used to transform XL1-Blue. The same approach was used to prepare three DEC1 mutants that had single or double residues substituted in the DNA binding domain (P56A, R58P, or both). The general sequence for the site-directed mutagenic oligonucleotides was 5′-GAGACCTACAAATTGGCGCACCCGCTCATCGAGAAAAAGAG-3′ with the nucleotides in boldface type substituted individually or simultaneously. All mutated constructs were subjected to sequencing analysis to confirm the desired mutation being made without secondary mutations. Cells (293T) were plated in 24-well plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 107 fetal calf serum at a density of 1.6 × 105cells/well. Transfection was conducted by lipofection with LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfection mixtures contained DEC1 or a mutant construct (100 ng), reporter plasmid (100 ng), and the pRL-TK Renilla plasmid (1 ng). If a DEC1-stable line was used, DEC1 or its mutant construct was omitted from the transfection mixture. The transfected cells were cultured for an additional 24 h, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in passive lysis buffer (Promega). The lysed cells were subjected to two cycles of freezing/thawing. The reporter enzyme activities were assayed with a Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system. This system contained two substrates, which were used to determine the activity of two luciferases sequentially. The firefly luciferase activity, which represented the reporter gene activity, was initiated by mixing an aliquot of lysates (20 ॖl) with Luciferase Assay Reagent II. Then the firefly luminescence was quenched, and the Renillaluminescence was simultaneously activated by adding Stop & Glo reagent to the sample wells. The firefly luminescence signal was normalized based on the Renilla luminescence signal. In cases where the reading on the luciferase activity was too high, the lysates were diluted, and luciferase activities were then determined to minimize the interference on the reading of the Renilla luciferase activity. Cells (293T) were transfected with DEC1 or a mutant, and nuclear extracts were prepared with a nuclear extraction kit (Active Motif). In some cases, DEC1-stable transfected cells were used but cultured in the presence or absence of tetracycline to modulate the expression of transfected DEC1. Nuclear proteins (10 ॖg) were incubated with radiolabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides (5′-CGTTCCGCACGTGAGCTGGG-3′) in a final volume of 10 ॖl containing 1× DNA binding buffer. For competition experiments, nuclear extracts were first incubated with a 10- or 50-fold molar excess of cold probe and then mixed with the radiolabeled probe. Oligonucleotides with a disrupted E-box were also used in the competition assays. For supershift assays, the anti-DEC1 or an anti-FLAG antibody was added either before or after the nuclear extracts were incubated with the radiolabeled probe. The protein-DNA complexes were resolved in 67 PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. Western analyses were conducted as described previously (27Zhu W. Song L. Matoney L. LeCluyse E. Yan B. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2000; 28: 186-191PubMed Google Scholar). The anti-DEC1 antibody against the COOH-terminal peptide was described elsewhere (23Li Y. Zhang H. Xie M. Hu M. Ge S. Yang D. Wan Y. Yan B. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 413-422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined with BCA assay (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Data are presented as mean ± S.D. of at least four separate experiments, except where results of blots are shown, in which case a representative experiment is depicted in the figures. We have reported that DEC1 is abundantly expressed in colon carcinoma but not in the adjacent normal tissues (23Li Y. Zhang H. Xie M. Hu M. Ge S. Yang D. Wan Y. Yan B. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 413-422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The initial focus of the present study was to extend the expression study on DEC1 and to determine whether DEC1 and DEC2 shared similar expression patterns among paired cancer-normal tissues from the colon, kidney, and lung. RT-PCR experiments with primers specific to DEC1 and DEC2 were performed. As shown in Fig.1, without exceptions, the levels of DEC1 mRNA were markedly higher in the carcinomas, whereas the levels of DEC2 mRNA were markedly higher in the adjacent normal tissues. Between paired samples, the levels of औ-actin mRNA were comparable. The carcinoma-related increase in DEC1 expression was also detected by Western blot (top of each depicted figure), suggesting that mRNA levels are indicative of the overall expression of these two genes. The inversed expression patterns between DEC1 and DEC2 suggest that DEC1 negatively regulates the expression of DEC2 orvice versa. In order to directly test this possibility, DEC1-stable transfected lines were used to study the expression relationship between DEC1 and DEC2. Two clonal stable lines were included: one expressing DEC1 (wild type) and the other expressing DEC1-M, which lacked the DNA binding domain. The stable lines were prepared with 293T cells and the pcDNA6/TR-pcDNA4 expression system; therefore, the expression of DEC1 and DEC1-M was inducibly regulated by tetracycline as described previously (23Li Y. Zhang H. Xie M. Hu M. Ge S. Yang D. Wan Y. Yan B. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 413-422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, the addition of tetracycline caused a concentration-dependent increase on the levels of DEC1 as determined by Western blots (Fig.2A, top). Consistent with the inducible increase in the levels of DEC1 protein, the levels of DEC1 mRNA were proportionally increased (data not shown). In contrast to the increased expression of DEC1, the levels of DEC2 mRNA were proportionally decreased (Fig. 2A). However, such inversed expression patterns were observed only in the cells expressing wild-type DEC1 (Fig. 2A) and not the cells expressing the DEC1 mutant, although the levels of DEC1-M were markedly induced by tetracycline (Fig. 2B). The inability of DEC1-M to down-regulate the expression of DEC2 suggests that DEC1-mediated repression is achieved through a DNA-binding mechanism. In order to directly test this possibility, reporter experiments and EMSA were conducted. A DEC2 promoter reporter (pLuc-1888) was constructed to contain the basal promoter and other potential regulatory sequences of the DEC2 gene (−1,888 to +11). This region was chosen because it contained two E-box motifs that commonly serve as target sequences for bHLH transcription factors (1Littlewood T.D. Evan G.I. Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1998: 1-48Google Scholar). A series of 5′ deletion mutants of this reporter was also prepared and designed to specify the location of DNA sequence that is targeted by DEC1 (Fig.3A, left). Co-transfection experiments were conducted to test these reporters for their ability to support DEC1-mediated activity. The stable transfected line (wild-type DEC1 only) was transfected again with a reporter construct and cultured in the presence or absence of tetracycline to modulate the expression of DEC1. The pRL-TK Renilla plasmid was also included in the transfection mixture to normalize transfection efficiency. As described in Fig. 3A (right), the addition of tetracycline decreased the activity of the pLuc-1888 reporter by as much as 907. Similar repression was observed with the reporters that had the sequence deleted up to nucleotide −535. In contrast, reporter pLuc-125, which had a further deletion from nucleotide −535 to −125, simultaneously lost the basal transcription activity and the ability to respond to DEC1, suggesting the importance of this region (−535 to −125) in both basal and regulatory transcription. We next examined whether responsiveness to DEC1 could be separated from the basal transcription activity in the DEC2 promoter reporter. Given the fact that this region (−535 to −125) contains a single E-box that is probably targeted by DEC1, a reporter with this E-box disrupted was tested for the ability to confer basal transcription. Reporter pLuc-535 was subjected to site-directed mutagenesis to selectively disrupt the E-box (CACGTG to AACGGG). Similarly, co-transfection experiments were performed. As shown in Fig.3A (bottom), disruption of this E-box (pLuc-535-M) caused little change in the basal activity (cultured without tetracycline), suggesting that this E-box contributes little to basal transcription. In contrast, the reporter mutant (pLuc-535-M) exhibited only ∼357 repression in response to DEC1 (Fig.3A, lane 8), which contrasts strikingly with 907 repression observed with the corresponding nonmutagenic reporter (Fig. 3A, lane 5). These findings suggest that the proximal E-box is largely responsible for DEC1-mediated repression. It should be emphasized that a similar observation was made with a substitution mutant reporter prepared from the longest reporter pLuc-1888, and the expression levels of DEC1 were comparable among all cells as determined by Western blots (data not shown). We next examined whether this E-box interacted directly with DEC1. The DEC1-stable line was cultured in the presence or absence of tetracycline, and nuclear extracts were prepared. Double-stranded oligonucleotides harboring this E-box were synthesized and radiolabeled. The labeled probe was incubated with the nuclear extracts and analyzed by EMSA. As shown in Fig. 3B, incubation with the extracts from the cells cultured in the presence of tetracycline yielded a shifted band (lane 8). This band was not detected when incubation was performed with the extracts from the cell cultured without tetracycline (lane 7). The shifted band was competed completely by 50× (lane 1) or partially by 10× excess cold probe (lane 3). However, the oligonucleotides (50×) that harbored a mutated E-box (E-box-M) showed no competitive activity (lane 2). In addition, the shifted band was supershifted by the anti-DEC1"
https://openalex.org/W2058780226,"In Pseudomonas aeruginosa the extracellular metabolite and siderophore pyochelin is synthesized from two major precursors, chorismate and l-cysteine via salicylate as an intermediate. The regulatory role of isochorismate synthase, the first enzyme in the pyochelin biosynthetic pathway, was studied. This enzyme is encoded by pchA, the last gene in the pchDCBA operon. The PchA protein was purified to apparent electrophoretic homogeneity from a PchA-overexpressingP. aeruginosa strain. The native enzyme was a 52-kDa monomer in solution, and its activity strictly depended on Mg2+. At pH 7.0, the optimum, a Km = 4.5 ॖm and a kcat = 43.1 min−1 were determined for chorismate. No feedback inhibitors or other allosteric effectors were found. The intracellular PchA concentration critically determined the rate of salicylate formation both in vitro and in vivo. In cultures grown in iron-limiting media to high cell densities, overexpression of the pchA gene resulted in overproduction of salicylate as well as in enhanced pyochelin formation. From this work and earlier studies, it is proposed that one important factor influencing the flux through the pyochelin biosynthetic pathway is the PchA concentration, which is determined at a transcriptional level, with pyochelin acting as a positive signal and iron as a negative signal. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa the extracellular metabolite and siderophore pyochelin is synthesized from two major precursors, chorismate and l-cysteine via salicylate as an intermediate. The regulatory role of isochorismate synthase, the first enzyme in the pyochelin biosynthetic pathway, was studied. This enzyme is encoded by pchA, the last gene in the pchDCBA operon. The PchA protein was purified to apparent electrophoretic homogeneity from a PchA-overexpressingP. aeruginosa strain. The native enzyme was a 52-kDa monomer in solution, and its activity strictly depended on Mg2+. At pH 7.0, the optimum, a Km = 4.5 ॖm and a kcat = 43.1 min−1 were determined for chorismate. No feedback inhibitors or other allosteric effectors were found. The intracellular PchA concentration critically determined the rate of salicylate formation both in vitro and in vivo. In cultures grown in iron-limiting media to high cell densities, overexpression of the pchA gene resulted in overproduction of salicylate as well as in enhanced pyochelin formation. From this work and earlier studies, it is proposed that one important factor influencing the flux through the pyochelin biosynthetic pathway is the PchA concentration, which is determined at a transcriptional level, with pyochelin acting as a positive signal and iron as a negative signal. isochorismate synthase dihydroaeruginoate dithiothreitol isopropyl-औ-d- thiogalactopyranoside In bacteria, biosynthetic pathways are regulated, as a rule, by their end products, which can cause feedback inhibition of early key enzymes as well as repression of some or all enzymes of the pathway (1Madigan M.T. Martinko J.M. Parker J. Brock Biology of Microorganisms. 9th Ed. Prentice-Hall, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ2000: 212-235Google Scholar). For example, in histidine biosynthesis of Salmonella enterica, histidine allosterically inhibits the first enzyme and represses, by an attenuation mechanism, the expression of all enzymes of the pathway (2Winkler M.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella, Cellular and Molecular Biology. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 485-505Google Scholar). In arginine biosynthesis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, arginine inhibits the first and the second enzyme and represses the sixth enzyme, involving the transcriptional regulator ArgR (3Haas D. Kurer V. Leisinger T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 31: 290-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 4Haas D. Leisinger T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 52: 377-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 5Park S.M. Lu C.D. Abdelal A.T. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5309-5317Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A more complicated situation arises in branched biosynthetic pathways where the end products may exert control functions at several checkpoints. For instance, in aromatic biosynthesis of P. aeruginosa (Fig. 1), tryptophan inhibits one isoenzyme carrying out the first reaction (AroA) and, in addition, inhibits the first tryptophan-specific enzyme, anthranilate synthase (TrpEG). Tyrosine causes feedback inhibition of the second AroA isoenzyme and two tyrosine-specific enzymes. Furthermore, tyrosine activates and phenylalanine inhibits one key enzyme (AroQ-PheA) in the phenylalanine biosynthetic branch (Fig. 1). Repression plays a relatively minor role in aromatic biosynthesis of P. aeruginosa and appears to be limited to three steps in the tryptophan biosynthetic branch (6Calhoun D.H. Pierson D.L. Jensen R.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1973; 121: 117-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 7Patel N. Pierson D.L. Jensen R.A. J. Biol.

Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4061-4070Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It is important to note that, in the examples cited, all end products are intracellular metabolites. The question which concerns us here is whether the same general rules also apply to the bacterial production of extracellular metabolites. As an example, we will consider the siderophore pyochelin and its biosynthetic precursor salicylate (Fig. 1), which are produced and excreted by P. aeruginosa during iron limitation (12Cox C.D. Rinehart Jr., K. Moore M.L. Cook Jr., J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4256-4260Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Pyochelin synthesis starts from chorismate (13Ankenbauer R.G. Toyokuni T. Staley A. Rinehart K.L. Cox C.D. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 5344-5351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Serino L. Reimmann C. Baur H. Beyeler M. Visca P. Haas D. Mol. Gen.

Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 248-257Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a branch point intermediate in aromatic biosynthesis, and uses two molecules ofl-cysteine (Fig. 1). Interestingly, pyochelin causes induction rather than repression of its biosynthetic enzymes (16Reimmann C. Serino L. Beyeler M. Haas D. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 3135-3148Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The mechanism of this autoinduction is not entirely clear but probably involves an initial interaction of pyochelin with its outer membrane receptor, FptA, followed by activation of the transcriptional regulator PchR, which turns on the transcription of the pyochelin biosynthetic operons pchDCBA and pchEFGHI (16Reimmann C. Serino L. Beyeler M. Haas D. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 3135-3148Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 17Heinrichs D.E. Poole K. J.

Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 813-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In this signal transduction pathway, the end product pyochelin is unlikely to accumulate in the cytoplasm. A similar regulatory mechanism has been observed for another siderophore of P. aeruginosa, pyoverdin (19Lamont I.L. Beare P.A. Ochsner U. Vasil A.I. Vasil M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7072-7077Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). When cells have accumulated excess iron the Fur repressor is activated, which switches off the expression of the pyochelin and pyoverdin biosynthetic genes (15Serino L. Reimmann C. Visca P. Beyeler M. Della Chiesa V. Haas D. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 248-257Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Reimmann C. Serino L. Beyeler M. Haas D. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 3135-3148Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 20Barton H.A. Johnson Z. Cox C.D. Vasil A.I. Vasil M.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 1005-1017Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Here, we ask how the activity of the first enzyme of pyochelin biosynthesis, isochorismate synthase (ICS1; EC 5.4.99.6), is regulated. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of chorismate to isochorismate and is the product of pchA, the last gene of the pchDCBA operon in P. aeruginosa (14Serino L. Reimmann C. Baur H. Beyeler M. Visca P. Haas D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 249: 217-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 15Serino L. Reimmann C. Visca P. Beyeler M. Della Chiesa V. Haas D. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 248-257Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The subsequent reaction is catalyzed by the pchB product, isochorismate pyruvate-lyase (21Gaille C. Kast P. Haas D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21768-21775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), which produces salicylate (Fig.1). The pchA gene is strictly co-expressed with the upstream pchB gene; withoutpchB being present in cis no expression ofpchA can be observed (14Serino L. Reimmann C. Baur H. Beyeler M. Visca P. Haas D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 249: 217-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), suggesting that ICS and isochorismate pyruvate-lyase are produced in proportional amounts by the cells under all circumstances. Here, we report that purified ICS ofP. aeruginosa is insensitive to end products of aromatic biosynthesis, in particular to salicylate, and that salicylate formation is determined essentially by the concentration rather than by allosteric control of the first enzyme. This also has implications for the productivity of the pyochelin biosynthetic pathway. P. aeruginosa strains PAO1 (wild type) and ADD1976 (PAO1 with the T7 RNA polymerase, chromosomally expressed from the lac promoter) (25Brunschwig E. Darzins A. Gene. 1992; 111: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) as well as plasmid pME3359 (PT7-pchBA) have been described previously (14Serino L. Reimmann C. Baur H. Beyeler M. Visca P. Haas D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 249: 217-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The construction of plasmid pME3395 is detailed in the legend of Fig.2. Media and culture conditions for growth of P. aeruginosahave been given elsewhere (14Serino L. Reimmann C. Baur H. Beyeler M. Visca P. Haas D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 249: 217-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 15Serino L. Reimmann C. Visca P. Beyeler M. Della Chiesa V. Haas D. J.

Sodium isochorismate, used as a reference, was a kind gift from E. W. Leistner (University of Cologne) or was prepared and purified as described previously (21Gaille C. Kast P. Haas D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21768-21775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Racemic dihydroaeruginoate (Dha) and chorismate were prepared by the methods of Serino et al. (15Serino L. Reimmann C. Visca P. Beyeler M. Della Chiesa V. Haas D. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 248-257Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Grisostomi et al. (26Grisostomi C. Kast P. Pulido R. Huynh J. Hilvert D. Bioorg. Chem. 1997; 25: 297-305Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar), respectively. Crude cell extracts were prepared from P. aeruginosa ADD1976 harboring the T7 promoter construct pME3359 (Fig. 2) and grown in 750 ml of nutrient yeast broth with isopropyl-औ-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) induction, as described for the extraction of PchB from a similar strain (25Brunschwig E. Darzins A. Gene. 1992; 111: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Extracts contained ∼8 mg of protein per milliliter of buffer A (50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 107 (v/v) glycerol and 1 mmdithiothreitol (DTT)). Crude extract (15 ml) was applied to a DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B column (1.6 × 20 cm) equilibrated with 10 volumes of buffer A. PchA was eluted by washing the column with 300 ml of buffer A at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The fractions containing PchA (180 ml) were combined and loaded onto a column of phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B (1.6 × 10 cm) equilibrated with buffer A. Most of the contaminant proteins, including PchB, were eluted by washing the column with 200 ml of buffer A at 1 ml/min. More hydrophobic proteins were eluted with a step gradient of ethylene glycol as follows: 257 (v/v), 60 ml; 25–407 (v/v), 60 ml; and 407 (v/v), 65 ml. PchA was eluted with about 40 ml of 407 (v/v) ethylene glycol. This fraction was diluted five times, resulting in a buffer of 10 mmpotassium phosphate, 87 (v/v) ethylene glycol, 27 (v/v) glycerol, and 1 mm DTT, and it was loaded onto a MonoQ HR 5/5 column (fast protein liquid chromatography) equilibrated with modified buffer A containing 10 mm potassium phosphate. PchA was eluted by washing the column with standard buffer A at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. PchA-containing fractions (4 ml) were pooled and stored at −80°C. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (27Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215676) Google Scholar) using a commercial reagent (Bio-Rad) and bovine serum albumin as the standard. The N-terminal sequence of PchA was determined by Dr. P. James (Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule, Zürich, Switzerland) on an Applied Biosystems peptide sequencer model 473A using Edman degradation. The subunit molecular mass of PchA was estimated by SDS-PAGE according to Lämmli and Favre (28Lämmli U.K. Favre M. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 80: 575-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (3025) Google Scholar) using the low molecular weight calibration kit from Amersham Biosciences as a standard. The molecular mass of native PchA was estimated by gel filtration chromatography on Sephadex G-150 (1.6 × 70 cm, 0.1 ml/min) and Bio-Gel P100 (1.6 × 70 cm, 0.1 ml/min) columns in buffer A with ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa), lysozyme (14.6 kDa), proteinase K (28.8 kDa), pepsin (34.5 kDa), protein A (42 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), and bovine serum albumin (67 kDa) as markers. The elution volumes were plotted against the logarithm of molecular masses for the standards, and the linear regression curve was used to estimate the apparent molecular mass of PchA. The molecular mass of native PchA was also estimated from PAGE in non-denaturing gels of 7.5, 10, 12, 15, and 207 polyacrylamide, with the low molecular weight calibration kit fromAmersham Biosciences as a standard, by Ferguson plot analysis (29Tietz D. Chrambach A. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 395-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The slopes obtained from plots of the logarithm of relative mobilityversus polyacrylamide concentration were plotted against the molecular mass values of the standard proteins. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were generated by subcutaneous injection of about 410 ॖg of purified PchA and used in immunoblots as described (21Gaille C. Kast P. Haas D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21768-21775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise stated, the incubation mixture contained, in a final volume of 500 ॖl, 100 mmpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 10 mmMgCl2, 107 (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 500 ॖm chorismate (purified by high pressure liquid chromatography), 48 units of purified PchB (corresponding to 3.7 ॖg) (21Gaille C. Kast P. Haas D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21768-21775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and ≤ 2 units of PchA. One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the formation of 1 nmol of isochorismate (assayed as salicylate) per minute for ICS and isochorismate pyruvate-lyase. The reaction at 37 °C was initiated by the addition of chorismate to the enzyme solution and terminated after 5 min by the addition of 10 ॖl of concentrated HCl (10 m), followed by extraction with 3 ml of ethyl acetate. Blanks were obtained from non-incubated complete reaction mixtures. The product of the coupled enzymatic reaction, salicylate, was measured by its fluorescence using an excitation wavelength of 305 nm and an emission wavelength of 440 nm. The amount of salicylate formed was determined from a standard curve obtained with 0.5–8 ॖm salicylic acid in ethyl acetate. Assays for kinetic studies were performed in triplicate with 0.96 ॖg of purified PchA and 3.7 ॖg of PchB in standard incubation buffer with chorismate concentrations varying from 1 to 500 ॖm. The steady-state kinetic values did not vary by more than ± 107. Initial velocity data were fitted to the equation of Hanes, using Enzpack software (Biosoft). The influence of Mg2+ on the activity of PchA was studied in an incubation mixture containing 100 mm potassium phosphate pH 7.0, 1 mm DTT, and 107 glycerol (v/v). PchA (3.9 ॖg) was preincubated at 37 °C for 10 min. EDTA and MgCl2 were added at concentrations of 1 mm and 10 mm, respectively. The reaction was started by adding PchB (0.54 ॖg) and 100 ॖm chorismate and stopped after 5 min. ICS activity was measured in a coupled assay in the presence of an excess of PchB (typically ∼30-fold with respect to units of enzyme activity). Thus, the isochorismate formed was converted quantitatively to salicylate during the incubation. Because the pchA gene is expressed only when the pchB gene is present in cis (14Serino L. Reimmann C. Baur H. Beyeler M. Visca P. Haas D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 249: 217-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), we isolated PchA from P. aeruginosa ADD1976 carrying pME3359, which expresses both the pchBA genes from the T7 promoter (Fig.2), according to the purification scheme described under “Experimental Procedures.” PchA was purified to apparent homogeneity with 587 yield by three chromatographic steps (Table I). SDS-PAGE of the fraction obtained after the final MonoQ chromatography step indicated a ≥ 987 pure protein of about 50 kDa (data not shown). This subunit molecular mass is in good agreement with that (52.1 kDa) calculated from the deduced sequence of 476 amino acids residues (14Serino L. Reimmann C. Baur H. Beyeler M. Visca P. Haas D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 249: 217-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the PchA polypeptide (Ser-Arg-Leu-Ala-Pro-Leu-Ser-Gln) obtained by Edman degradation matched that predicted from sequence data (14Serino L. Reimmann C. Baur H. Beyeler M. Visca P. Haas D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 249: 217-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and indicates cleavage of the N-terminal methionine.Table IPurification of the PchA enzyme from P. aeruginosa ADD1976/pME3359Purification stepProteinActivitySpecific activityYieldPurificationmgunitsunits/mg7-foldCrude cell extract13310,369781001DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B31.68,814279853.6Phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B8.07,1058906911.4MonoQ HR 5/53.66,0151,6715821.4Data shown are taken from a typical preparation.

In three independent experiments, the reproducibility of the purification factors was ± 107. During PchA purification PchB activity was also followed, as there had been some previous speculation that PchA and PchB might form an enzymatic complex (14Serino L. Reimmann C. Baur H. Beyeler M. Visca P. Haas D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 249: 217-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). However, during the first chromatographic step on DEAE-Sepharose, PchA was eluted after and well separated from PchB. Moreover, gel filtration of crude extracts on Bio-Gel P100 did not reveal any association of PchA and PchB (data not shown). This was estimated by gel exclusion chromatography on Sephadex G-150 and Bio-Gel P100 and by native PAGE at varying polyacrylamide concentrations. The molecular masses of 48 ± 2, 50 ± 2, and 50 ± 2 obtained by the three methods, respectively, indicate that the enzyme exists as a monomer. Like the entC andmenF isoenzymes having ICS activity in Escherichia coli (30Liu J. Quinn N. Berchtold G.A. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1417-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 31Daruwala R. Bhattacharyya D.K. Kwon O. Meganathan R. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3133-3138Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), the PchA enzyme of P. aeruginosastrictly depended on the presence of Mg2+. The PchA enzyme, pretreated with 1 mm EDTA and incubated in an incubation mixture without Mg2+, was inactive (≤ 1.17 activity). The addition of 10 mm MgCl2 restored activity (data not shown). PchA showed hyperbolic saturation kinetics with its substrate, chorismate, with an apparent Km = 4.5 ± 0.5 ॖm and a kcat = 43.1 ± 4.9 min−1. Optimal activity was observed at pH 7.0 (data not shown). The chorismate-isochorismate interconversion catalyzed by PchA was reversible; incubation of PchA with isochorismate yielded chorismate (Fig. 3). Reversibility has also been observed for both ICSs of E. coli (30Liu J. Quinn N. Berchtold G.A. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1417-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 32Dahm C. Müller R. Schulte G. Schmidt K. Leistner E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1425: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We tested a range of potential effectors of PchA. However, <107 inhibition or activation of ICS activity was found under standard assay conditions after the addition of either the end product pyochelin (100 ॖm), the pathway intermediates salicylate (10 ॖm) or dihydroaeruginoate (Dha in Fig. 1) (100 ॖm), and the aromatic amino acids tryptophan (100 ॖm), tyrosine (100 ॖm) or phenylalanine (100 ॖm). Furthermore, the addition of Fe2+(100 ॖm) or cysteine (200 ॖm) did not significantly alter ICS activity. Thus, there is no evidence that aromatic amino acids or metabolites of the pyochelin pathway inP. aeruginosa (Fig. 1) can regulate the activity of the PchA enzyme. To determine the rate-limiting factor in salicylate production, we prepared a crude extract from PAO1 wild type cells grown under iron limitation. A sample of this extract containing ∼150 ng of PchA and ∼100 ng of PchB, as judged by Western blots (data not shown) per 290 ॖg of total cellular protein, was incubated in the presence of 100 ॖm chorismate in 500 ॖl of incubation buffer. Under these conditions, the formation of salicylate was limited by the PchA concentration in the extract (Fig.4). This could be seen when an excess (500 ng) of purified PchA was added; thereby, the rate of salicylate synthesis was increased ∼3-fold and the transient time,i.e. the lag before steady state conditions were reached in the coupled enzyme reaction, was shortened from 1.5 min to <0.1 min (Fig. 4). This reduction of the transient time illustrates the fact that added PchA enhances the availability of the intermediate isochorismate to the second enzyme in the extract, PchB. By contrast, the addition of 500 ng of purified PchB did not enhance the capacity of the extract to synthesize salicylate (Fig. 4). These results indicate that in a crude P. aeruginosa PAO1 extract the activity of the first enzyme of the pathway, i.e. the synthesis of isochorismate, limits the rate of salicylate production. To test the role of the first enzyme in salicylate formation and to see how salicylate availability influences the productivity of the pyochelin pathway, we constructed thepchA overexpression plasmid pME3395 (Fig. 2) in which thepchBA genes were fused to the inducible tacpromoter (Ptac), and the pchBfunction was inactivated by an in-frame deletion, removing notably the codon for the essential Ile-88 residue of isochorismate pyruvate-lyase (21Gaille C. Kast P. Haas D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21768-21775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We verified that in vivo the internally truncated PchB protein was totally devoid of isochorismate pyruvate-lyase activity. The mutated protein also lacked chorismate mutase activity (data not shown), the second PchB function (21Gaille C. Kast P. Haas D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21768-21775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Using this somewhat unconventional construct, we overcame the problem that thepchA open reading frame cannot be expressed alone, even when it is equipped with a strong promoter and a good ribosome binding site (14Serino L. Reimmann C. Baur H. Beyeler M. Visca P. Haas D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 249: 217-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Salicylate, Dha, and pyochelin were measured in cultures of the wild type PAO1, with or without the PtacpchA overexpression construct pME3395. The growth medium used (GGP) contains glycerol and proteose peptone and favors pyochelin production because of limited iron availability (16Reimmann C. Serino L. Beyeler M. Haas D. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 3135-3148Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 33Carmi R. Varmeli S. Levy E. Gough F.G. J. Nat. Prod. 1994; 57: 1200-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Proteose peptone, a milk fraction containing mostly casein cleavage products, is a rich source of amino acids with the notable exception of cysteine, which is underrepresented (34Steele B.F. Sauberlich H.E. Reynolds M.S. Baumann C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1949; 177: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore also conducted a series of experiments using GGP medium amended with 2 mml-cysteine. In both media, pchA overexpression driven by the addition of the inducer IPTG caused strong salicylate accumulation and pyochelin overproduction during stationary phase, concomitant with the increased accumulation of Dha (TableII). During late exponential phase, the addition of 2 mml-cysteine significantly enhanced the conversion of salicylate to pyochelin; however, irrespective of cysteine addition, pyochelin concentrations were consistently increased by pchA overexpression in comparison with wild type cultures (Table II).Table IIEffects of PchA overexpression on the in vivo synthesis of salicylate, Dha, and pyochelin by P. aeruginosaPlasmid in PAO12-aCells of P. aeruginosa PAO1, without or with the pchA+ plasmid pME3395, were grown aerobically at 37 °C in 200 ml of GGP medium (33) containing glycerol and proteose peptone to the OD600nm indicated. 1.0 OD600nm unit corresponds to approx. 109 cells/ml.Addition to growth medium2-bConcentration of supplements were IPTG, 1 mM;l-cysteine (Cys), 2mm.Growth phaseOD600nmConcentration in culture supernatant2-cThe values given represent the means ± S.D. for three independent experiments.SalicylateDhaPyochelinnmol ml−1nmol ml−1nmol ml−1NoneNoneLate exp.2-dLate exp., late exponential.3.9 ± 0.29.0 ± 8.01.5 ± 1.3173.5 ± 24.0Stationary5.9 ± 0.527.4 ± 23.811.8 ± 3.2550.0 ± 81.3pME3395NoneLate exp.3.2 ± 0.413.7 ± 2.96.4 ± 0.5307.8 ± 31.6Stationary5.9 ± 0.38.4 ± 7.949.1 ± 6.4741.4 ± 53.4pME3395IPTGLate exp.4.1 ± 0.2267.6 ± 34.19.3 ± 0.4516.0 ± 10.3Stationary6.6 ± 0.5914.9 ± 130.773.5 ± 2.41007.6 ± 34.2NoneCysLate exp.3.8 ± 0.2<8<1.2159.0 ± 19.2Stationary5.5 ± 0.1<85.1 ± 0.7730.8 ± 56.1pME3395CysLate exp.3.5 ± 0.3<82.8 ± 0.2363.6 ± 9.0Stationary6.6 ± 0.1<860.1 ± 6.31314.8 ± 102.3pME3395Cys, IPTGLate exp.4.5 ± 0.116.8 ± 1.49.2 ± 1.21072.4 ± 96.6Stationary6.6 ± 0.2744.7 ± 85.7128.3 ± 44.01708.6 ± 210.82-a Cells of P. aeruginosa PAO1, without or with the pchA+ plasmid pME3395, were grown aerobically at 37 °C in 200 ml of GGP medium (33Carmi R.

Open table in a new tab PchA induction by IPTG was monitored in parallel by Western blot analysis and showed the expected expression pattern (Fig.5A). The amount of PchB protein was also followed by Western blots; there was no indication of the chromosomally encoded PchB protein being overexpressed duringpchA induction (data not shown). In another control experiment we confirmed that the addition of excess iron to the growth medium completely abolished the expression of the chromosomalpchA gene in strain PAO1 (Fig. 5B). From these results we conclude the following. (i) The intracellular concentration of PchA determines the rate of salicylate production bothin vivo and in vitro. (ii) PchA concentration also determines the flux to pyochelin, and this effect is seen whether or not the medium contains an extra supply of the cosubstratel-cysteine. (iii) Excess iron brings the expression of PchA (and the other enzymes of the pathway as well) to a halt by Fur-mediated repression of the pchDCBA andpchEFGHI operons (15Serino L. Reimmann C. Visca P. Beyeler M. Della Chiesa V. Haas D. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 248-257Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Reimmann C. Serino L. Beyeler M. Haas D. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 3135-3148Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Using the siderophore pyochelin of P. aeruginosa as an example, we have addressed the question of where the bottleneck lies in a bacterial biosynthetic pathway leading to extracellular products. Clearly, the classical pattern, i.e. feedback inhibition and repression by the end product, is not observed here. Instead, we propose that the concentration of the first, non-allosteric enzyme, ICS, is one key determinant controlling the productivity of the pyochelin pathway (Table II). A similar observation has been made in filamentous fungi where penicillin production is critically dependent on the amount of the first enzyme, δ-(l-α-aminoadipyl)-l-cysteinyl-d-valine synthetase (35Kennedy J. Turner G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 253: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in Streptomyces clavuligerusthe reaction catalyzed by this enzyme is a rate-limiting step in cephalosporin biosynthesis (36Khetan A. Malmberg L.H. Sherman D.H. Hu W.S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 782: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). However, in other bacterial pathways producing extracellular compounds, the rate-limiting steps have rarely (if ever) been investigated. In its native context, the pchA gene is placed last in thepchDCBA operon, which encodes, in this order, a salicylate-activating enzyme (22Quadri L.E. Keating T.A. Patel H.M. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14941-14954Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), a thioesterase of unknown function (15Serino L. Reimmann C. Visca P. Beyeler M. Della Chiesa V. Haas D. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 248-257Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), isochorismate pyruvate-lyase (21Gaille C. Kast P. Haas D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21768-21775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and ICS (Ref. 14Serino L. Reimmann C. Baur H. Beyeler M. Visca P. Haas D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 249: 217-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, and this study). The promoter of this operon is positively controlled by the PchR protein in the presence of pyochelin (16Reimmann C. Serino L. Beyeler M. Haas D. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 3135-3148Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and negatively by the Fur repressor in the presence of iron (15Serino L. Reimmann C. Visca P. Beyeler M. Della Chiesa V. Haas D. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 248-257Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Within the operon, the expression of the pchDC and pchBA genes is tightly coordinated at a post-transcriptional level (14Serino L. Reimmann C. Baur H. Beyeler M. Visca P. Haas D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 249: 217-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Thus, iron availability and pyochelin acting as an autoinducer are two major signals that determine the productivity of the pathway by regulatingpchA expression. The high affinity of PchA for chorismate (Km = 4.5 ॖm) enables this enzyme to draw effectively on the chorismate pool in competition with the other enzymes of aromatic metabolism in P. aeruginosa (Fig. 1). In strain PAO1/pME3395, maximizing PchA expression by IPTG addition caused no measurable reduction in exponential growth rate and growth yield (data not shown), suggesting that maximal pyochelin synthesis does not seriously deplete the chorismate resources. The data of Table II also show that cysteine availability in the growth medium improves the conversion of salicylate to pyochelin during growth and enhances the yield of pyochelin, especially in the stationary phase. Similar observations have recently been reported for another strain of P. aeruginosa (37Audenaert K. Pattery T. Cornelis P. Höfte M. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 2002; 15: 1147-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). It is not known, however, whether there are regulatory links between pyochelin and cysteine synthesis in P. aeruginosa. A multiple sequence alignment (Fig. 6) (38Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (55638) Google Scholar) places PchA of P. aeruginosa in a family of a dozen microbial ICSs that are currently known. As noted previously (14Serino L. Reimmann C. Baur H. Beyeler M. Visca P. Haas D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 249: 217-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), the TrpE component of anthranilate synthase and the PabB component of the aminodeoxychorismate synthase of various microorganisms show significant sequence identities with PchA, essentially because of a shared chorismate binding domain (39Wang Y. Addess K.J. Geer L. Madej T. Marchler-Bauer A. Zimmerman D. Bryant S.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 243-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 40Wildermuth M.C. Dewdney J. Wu G. Ausubel F.M. Nature. 2001; 414: 562-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar). However, the members of the ICS family do not intermingle with the PabB and TrpE families, contrary to the intrusion of the PabB ofBacillus subtilis into the TrpE cluster (Fig. 6,left side). The ICS tree constructed by sequence alignment (Fig. 6, right side) has strictly no resemblance with phylogenetic trees based on a sequence comparison of 16 S rRNAs or housekeeping proteins (41Ludwig W. Schleifer K.-H. ASM News. 1999; 65: 752-757Google Scholar), suggesting that the ICS genes have traveled widely in the microbial world. This idea is supported by the finding that the irp-9 and ybtS genes, which are required for yersiniabactin biosynthesis, are part of mobile pathogenicity islands (42Brem D. Pelludat C. Rakin A. Jacobi C.A. Heesemann J. Microbiology. 2001; 147: 1115-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Other ICS genes might also be part of pathogenicity islands and, as such, are transmissible between different bacteria. It has been speculated that MbtI of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, YbtS of Yersinia pestis, and Irp-9 ofYersinia enterocolitica, which are peripheral ICS family members (Fig. 6) and are slightly smaller proteins than PchA, might carry out the direct conversion of chorismate to salicylate, basically because in these organisms no pchB homolog has been found in the vicinity of the ICS genes (43Gehring A.M. DeMoll E. Fetherstone J.D. Mori I. Mayhew G.F. Blattner F.R. Walsh C.T. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: 573-586Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 44Quadri L.E. Sello J. Keating T.A. Weinreb P.H. Walsh C.T. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: 631-645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). We have examined the purifiedP. aeruginosa ICS for its ability to produce salicylate but found no evidence for such a reaction in vitro (Fig. 3).In vivo, PchA did not have salicylate synthase activity either, as an entC mutant of E. coli carrying pME3395 (pchA+) was unable to produce salicylate, whereas the same strain carrying pME3368 (pchAB+) did (14Serino L. Reimmann C. Baur H. Beyeler M. Visca P. Haas D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 249: 217-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). If the MbtI, YbtS, and Irp-9 proteins catalyzed just the chorismate-to-isochorismate conversion, another explanation should be sought. We found that the PchB enzyme of P. aeruginosa is structurally and perhaps also functionally related to chorismate mutase (21Gaille C. Kast P. Haas D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21768-21775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). It is therefore conceivable that in Yersinia and Mycobacteriumspp. the isochorismate pyruvate-lyase reaction might be executed by a chorismate mutase. A similar situation may possibly also occur inArabidopsis thaliana, where a PchA-like enzyme but no PchB homolog has been found (40Wildermuth M.C. Dewdney J. Wu G. Ausubel F.M. Nature. 2001; 414: 562-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar). We thank L. Rindisbacher for help with antibody preparation and E.W. Leistner for a gift of isochorismate."
https://openalex.org/W1995519722,We estimate the cosmic production rate of helium relative to metals (DeltaY/DeltaZ) using K dwarf stars in the Hipparcos catalog with accurate spectroscopic metallicities. The best fitting value is DeltaY/DeltaZ = 2.1 +/- 0.4 at the 68% confidence level. Our derived value agrees with determinations from H II regions and with theoretical predictions from stellar yields with standard assumptions for the initial mass function. The amount of helium in stars determines how long they live and therefore how fast they will enrich the interstellar medium with fresh material.
https://openalex.org/W2026879988,"Clinical studies suggest that estrogen may improve cognition in Alzheimer's patients. Basic experiments demonstrate that 17beta-estradiol protects against neurodegeneration in both cell and animal models. In the present study, a human SH-SY5Y cell model was used to investigate molecular mechanisms underlying the receptor-mediated neuroprotection of physiological concentrations of 17beta-estradiol. 17beta-estradiol (<10 nM) concomitantly increased neuronal nitric oxide synthase (NOS1) expression and cell viability. 17beta-estradiol-induced neuroprotection was blocked by the receptor antagonist ICI 182,780, also prevented by inhibitors of NOS1 (7-nitroindazole), guanylyl cyclase (LY 83,583), and cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) (Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPs). In addition to the expression of NOS1 and MnSOD, 17beta-estradiol increased the expression of the redox protein thioredoxin (Trx), which was blocked by the inhibition of either cGMP formation or PKG activity. The expression of heme oxygenase 2 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor was not altered. Estrogen receptor-enhanced cell viability against oxidative stress may be linked to Trx expression because the Trx reductase inhibitor, 5,5'-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) significantly reduced the cytoprotective effect of 17beta-estradiol. Furthermore, Trx (1 microM) inhibited lipid peroxidation, proapoptotic caspase-3, and cell death during oxidative stress caused by serum deprivation. We conclude that cGMP-dependent expression of Trx--the redox protein with potent antioxidative and antiapoptotic properties--may play a pivotal role in estrogen-induced neuroprotection."
https://openalex.org/W2112002571,"Lymphocyte emigration from the blood into most secondary lymphoid organs and chronically inflamed tissues occurs at the level of high endothelial venules (HEV). A unique characteristic of HEV endothelial cells (HEVEC) is their capacity to incorporate large amounts of sulfate into sialomucin-type counter-receptors for the lymphocyte homing receptor L-selectin. We have previously shown that sulfate uptake into HEVEC is mediated by two distinct functional classes of sulfate transporters: Na+-coupled transporters and sulfate/anion exchangers. Here, we report the molecular characterization from human HEVEC of SLC26A11, a novel member of the SLC26 sulfate/anion exchanger family. Functional expression studies in COS-7 and Sf9 insect cells revealed that SLC26A11 is targeted to the cell membrane and exhibits Na+-independent sulfate transport activity, sensitive to the anion exchanger inhibitor 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (DIDS). Northern blot analysis showed the highest SLC26A11 transcript levels in placenta, kidney, and brain. The SLC26A11 gene mapped to human chromosome 17q25, very close to the hereditary hearing loss diseases loci DFNA20, DFNA26, and USH1G. RT-PCR analysis of SLC26 sulfate transporters in human HEVEC revealed coexpression of SLC26A11 with SLC26A2/DTDST and lack of SLC26A1/SAT1, SLC26A3/DRA, and SLC26A8/TAT1. Together, our results indicate that SLC26A11 is a novel Na+-independent sulfate transporter that may cooperate with SLC26A2 to mediate DIDS-sensitive sulfate uptake into HEVEC."

Nonetheless, profound differences remain in the acquisition, progression, and outcome of important diseases such as AIDS and Alzheimer's, for which the underlying basis remains obscure. We explored the utility of human high-density oligonucleotide arrays to survey the transcription profile of NHP genomes. Total RNA from prefrontal cortices of human (Homo sapiens), common chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), cynomolgous macaque (Macaca fascicularis), and common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) was labeled and hybridized to Affymetrix U95A GeneChip probe arrays. Corresponding data obtained previously from common chimpanzee and orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus) were added for comparison. Qualitative (present or not detected) and quantitative (expression level) analysis indicated that many genes known to be involved in human neurological disorders were present and regulated in NHPs. A gene involved in dopamine metabolism (catechol-O-methyltransferase) was absent in macaque and marmoset. Glutamate receptor 2 was up-regulated, and transcription-associated genes were down-regulated in NHPs compared with humans. We demonstrate that transcript profiling of NHPs could provide comparative genomic data to validate and better focus experimental animal models of human neurological disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2113236143,"2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB) has been widely used as a blocker of the IP3 receptor and TRP channels, including store-operated calcium channels. We now show in monolayers of normal rat kidney cells (NRK/49F) that 2-APB completely and reversibly blocks gap junctional intercellular communication at concentrations similar to that required for inhibition of PGF2alpha-induced increases in intracellular calcium. Gap junctional conductances between NRK cells were estimated with single-electrode patch-clamp measurements and were fully blocked by 2-APB (50 microM), when applied extracellularly but not via the patch pipette. Half maximal inhibition (IC50) of electrical coupling in NRK cells was achieved at 5.7 microM. Similar results were obtained for human embryonic kidney epithelial cells (HEK293/tsA201) with an IC50 of 10.3 microM. Using 2-APB as an electrical uncoupler of monolayer cells, we could thus measure inward rectifier potassium, L-type calcium, and calcium-dependent chloride membrane currents in confluent NRK monolayers, with properties similar to those in dissociated NRK cells in the absence of 2-APB. The electrical uncoupling action described here is a new 2-APB property that promises to provide a powerful pharmacological tool to study single-cell properties in cultured confluent monolayers and intact tissues by electrical and chemical uncoupling of the cells without the need of prior dissociation."
https://openalex.org/W2049201395,"Repetitive mechanical deformation may stimulate intestinal epithelial proliferation. Because the extracellular matrix modulates static intestinal epithelial biology, we examined whether matrix proteins influence intestinal epithelial responses to deformation. Human Caco-2BBE cells and nontransformed human enterocytes (HIPEC) were subjected to 10% average cyclic strain at 10 cycles/min on flexible membranes precoated with matrix proteins without or with plasma fibronectin or functional anti-integrin antibodies in the medium. Strain stimulated proliferation, focal adhesion kinase, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK), p38, and Jun N-terminal kinase similarly on collagen I or IV, and more weakly on laminin, but had no effect on fibronectin. MEK blockade (PD98059) prevented strain-stimulated proliferation on collagen but did not affect proliferation on fibronectin. Adding tissue fibronectin to a collagen substrate or plasma fibronectin to the media suppressed strain s mitogenic and signal effects, but not those of epidermal growth factor. Functional antibodies to the alpha5 or alpha(v) integrin subunit blocked strain's effects on Caco-2 proliferation and ERK activation, although ligation of the alpha2 or alpha6 subunit did not. Repetitive strain also stimulated, and fibronectin inhibited, human intestinal primary epithelial cell proliferation. Repetitive deformation stimulates transformed and nontransformed human intestinal epithelial proliferation in a matrix-dependent manner. Tissue or plasma fibronectin may regulate the intestinal epithelial response to strain via integrins containing alpha5 or alpha(v)."
https://openalex.org/W2094459188,"kpm is a human serine/threonine kinase that is homologous to Drosophila tumor suppressor warts/lats and its mammalian homologue LATS1.

Western blot analysis showed that high levels of expression of kpm-wt as well as kpm-kd with an apparent mass of 150 kDa were induced after the removal of doxycycline. Induction of kpm-wt expression resulted in a marked decline in viable cell number measured by both trypan blue dye exclusion and MTT assay, whereas that of kpm-kd or luciferase had no effect.

Introduction of human LATS1 into Drosophilawarts/lats mutants could prevent tumor formation and support normal development, demonstrating that the functions of these genes are conserved from flies to humans. Moreover, mice deficient for mouseLATS1 developed soft tissue sarcomas and ovarian tumor (13St John M.A. Tao W. Fei X. Fukumoto R. Carcangiu M.L. Brownstein D.G. Parlow A.F. McGrath J. Xu T. Nat.

Nishiyama Y. Kawasuzi M. Hiraoka T. Mimori T. Araki N. Izawa I. Inagaki M. Saya H. FEBS Lett. 2002; 529: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Overexpression of kpm resulted in an increase in cell population at the S/G2/M phase. However, in contrast to LATS1, our knowledge of kpm is still limited and its physiological function remains largely unclear. Thus, it is to be determined whether kpm plays a crucial role in regulation of cell growth as has been demonstrated with LATS1. In the present study, we generated HeLa-derived stable transfectants of kpm based on the tetracycline-responsive expression system and analyzed the function of kpm in terms of cell cycle progression and cell viability. Here we present data indicating that kpm negatively regulates cell growth by inducing G2/M arrest and apoptotic cell death through its kinase activity. HeLa Tet-Off cells (16Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4256) Google Scholar) were purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) (Invitrogen) and 100 μg/ml G418 (Sigma Chemical Co.). For selection of double transfectants and induction of gene expression, tetracycline-free FCS (Clontech) was used. The hemagglutinin-A (HA)1-tagged wild-typekpm cDNA and its kinase-dead mutant described previously (1Hori T. Takaori-Kondo A. Kamikubo Y. Uchiyama T. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3101-3109Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) were recloned into pTRE vector (Clontech) downstream of the tetracycline-responsive promoter to make pTRE-kpm-wt and pTRE-kpm-kd, respectively. pTRE-Luc control response plasmid (16Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4256) Google Scholar) was obtained from Clontech. HeLa Tet-Off cells were transfected with pTRE-kpm-wt, pTRE-kpm-kd, or pTRE-Luc together with pTK-Hyg (Clontech) by electroporation using a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). After 2 days, transfected cells were subjected to selection with 200 μg/ml hygromycin B (Invitrogen) in the presence of 10 ng/ml doxycycline (Clontech). Hygromycin-resistant cell lines were screened for induction of kpm-wt or kpm-kd expression upon removal of doxycycline by Western blotting. Induction of luciferase activity in pTRE-Luc-transfectants was confirmed with the luciferase assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI) and luminometry (Berthold Australia Pty Ltd., Bundoora, Australia). Both adherent and non-adherent cells were harvested by trypsinization, and the viable cell number as well as the cell viability was measured by microscopic examination with trypan blue dye exclusion. Cellular proliferation was measured by reduction of MTT, which corresponds to living cell number and metabolic activity (17Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (46516) Google Scholar). Cells were thoroughly washed, plated at 5×104 cells/well in 24-well plates and incubated with or without 10 ng/ml doxycycline for various periods of time (for 1–5 days). 50 μl of 1 mg/ml MTT solution (WST-8, Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) was added to each well. After 1 h of incubation, the absorbance of each well was measured at 492 and 630 nm using a microplate reader Benchmark (Bio-Rad Laboratories) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were harvested and lysed in TG-VO4 solution (18Sun Z. Fay D.S. Marini F. Foiani M. Stern D.F. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 395-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) (1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 0.198 trypsin inhibitor units (TIU) of aprotinin per milliliter of Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline lacking divalent cations with fresh 100 mm Na3VO4) containing 0.1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1× Complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). After centrifugation, the supernatants were collected, and the protein concentration of each cell lysate was measured. Adjusted amounts of cell lysates were separated on 7.5 or 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). After blocking, the membranes were incubated for 1 h with the first antibodies followed by incubation with peroxidase-conjugated second antibody for 1 h. The protein bands were detected using the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The antibodies used for Western blotting were mouse anti-HA monoclonal antibody (12CA5) (Roche Applied Science), rabbit anti-Cdc2 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), rabbit anti-cyclin B polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), a specific anti-phospho-Cdc2-Y15 rabbit polyclonal antibody (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), rabbit anti-Cdc25C polyclonal antibody (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), and goat anti-actin polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). kpm-wt-, kpm-kd-, and Luc-inducible HeLa Tet-Off cell lines were cultured in medium without doxycycline for the indicated periods of time, harvested and washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1% glucose. Cells were then fixed with 70% ethanol for 1 h and incubated in 1 ml of PBS containing 50 μl/ml of propidium iodide (Sigma), and 66 units/ml RNase (Invitrogen) on ice for 30 min. DNA content analysis was performed by a FACScan with CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). Cell populations at G2 and M phases were distinguished by the reactivity with mitotic protein monoclonal 2 (MPM-2 mouse monoclonal antibody) (Upstate, Waltham, MA) as described (19Kuang J. Ashorn C.L. Gonzalez-Kuyvenhoven M. Penkala J.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 20Yaffe M.B. Schutkowski M. Shen M. Zhou X.Z. Stukenberg P.T.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2926-2930Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were fixed in 70% methanol and stained with MPM-2 antibody followed by incubation with (Fab′)2 fraction of FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (BIOSOURCE, Camarillo, CA). After washing, cells were incubated with propidium iodide for DNA staining and then analyzed by two-color flow cytometry using the FACScan (BD Biosciences). MPM-2 reactive cells were considered to be at the mitotic phase, and the percentage of this population represented the mitotic index. Kpm-wt-, kpm-kd-, and Luc-inducible HeLa Tet-Off cell lines were cultured for 48 h with or without doxycycline, and then treated with 0.5 μg/ml nocodazole (Sigma) for the last 24 h (11Tao W. Zhang S.

Both adherent and non-adherent cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed three times with PBS (−) for thorough removal of nocodazole, and cultured without nocodazole for 50 min. Fluorescent microscopy of DAPI-stained cells indicated that most cells were in prometaphase and metaphase at this time point. Cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed three times with PBS (−), and lysed with TG-VO4solution containing 0.1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1× Complete protease inhibitors. The protein concentrations of the cell lysates were measured and adjusted equally. A part of each cell lysate was used for the study of whole cell expression of Cdc2, cyclin B, Cdc25C, and β-actin by Western blotting. The rest of the lysate was subjected to immunoprecipitation by anti-cyclin B monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Half of the immunoprecipitate was used to monitor Cdc2 co-immunoprecipitated with cyclin B by Western blotting. The Cdc2 fraction phosphorylated at Tyr-15 was detected by a specific anti-phospho-Cdc2-Y15 antibody. The remaining immunoprecipitate bound to beads was used for in vitro immune complex kinase assay as follows (18Sun Z. Fay D.S. Marini F. Foiani M. Stern D.F. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 395-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The precipitated beads were washed five times with TG-VO4solution and once with kinase buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA) and incubated in 20 μl of reaction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmNa3VO4, 0.1 mm ATP, 10 μCi of [α-32P]ATP, 5 μg of histone H1) at room temperature for 20 min. 20 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer was added and boiled for 5 min to stop the reaction. The phosphorylation of histone H1 (Sigma) was examined by separating the samples on a 15% SDS-PAGE gel and autoradiography. Apoptosis was measured by TUNEL (24Gold R. Schmied M. Giegerich G. Breitschopf H. Hartung H.P. Toyka K.V. Lassmann H. Lab. Invest. 1994; 71: 219-225PubMed Google Scholar). HeLa Tet-Off-kpm-wt, -kpm-kd, or -Luc cells were cultured for 5 days without doxycycline and then subjected to TUNEL assay using the FlowTACS FITC kit (Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD). TUNEL+ cells were quantified by flow cytometric analysis. To confirm the findings of TUNEL assay, apoptotic cells were also detected by DAPI staining (25Hull H.M. Hoshaw R.W. Wang J.C. Stain Technol. 1982; 57: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Cells were washed with PBS (−), transferred to 1.5-ml microtubes, and fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde at room temperature for 30 min. After washing with PBS (−), cells were resuspended in 20 μl of PBS (−) and mixed with 5 μl of 10 μl/ml DAPI (Sigma). Cell suspensions were mounted on slide glasses and subjected to fluorescence microscopic examination. HeLa Tet-Off cells were transfected with either pTRE-kpm-wt, pTRE-kpm-kd, or pTRE-Luc together with pTK-Hyg and subjected to selection with hygromycin B. Several stable transfectant lines of the three genes were expanded and screened for efficient gene induction by the removal of doxycycline. Representative transfectants of each of the three genes were compared with parental cells for the gene expression in the absence or presence of doxycycline. Western blot analysis showed that the representative lines of HeLa Tet-Off-kpm-wt and -kpm-kd were induced to express a large amount of kpm protein when cultured without doxycycline (Fig.1A). Expression of kpm was detected after 12 h and reached maximal levels after 48 h, dependent on the concentrations of doxycycline (Fig. 1B). Based on scanning densitometry, removal of doxycycline resulted in more than 100-fold induction of kpm-wt or kpm-kd by probing with anti-kpm polyclonal antibody, which recognize both endogenous and exogenous kpm (data not shown). Likewise, high levels of luciferase activity were induced in a representative HeLa Tet-Off-Luc upon the removal of doxycyline (data not shown). In order to explore the biological function of kpm, we first examined the effects of overexpression of kpm on cell viability and proliferation. HeLa Tet-Off-kpm-wt, -kpm-kd, and -Luc cells were switched into the culture without doxycycline, and the viable cell number was counted daily by trypan blue dye exclusion. As shown in Fig.2A, induction of kpm-wt expression resulted in a decline in viable cell number after 2 days compared with non-induced culture. In contrast, cell growth of HeLa Tet-Off-kpm-kd as well as -Luc was not affected by expression of these genes. In accordance with this, the MTT assay also showed that overexpression of kpm-wt suppressed cell proliferation while that of kpm-kd or luciferase had no effect (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that kpm is involved in either cell cycle progression or cell viability, and negatively regulates cell growth. Since overexpression of kpm-kd had no effect on cell viability or proliferation as that of luciferase, it is suggested that anti-proliferative effect of kpm is dependent on its kinase activity and kd mutant does not function as a dominant negative form at least in this particular assay system. Since overexpression of kpm-wt resulted in inhibition of cell proliferation and a decline in viable cell number, a cell cycle arrest was suspected to have occurred. To determine at which stage of the cell cycle cells were arrested, we performed the cell cycle analysis in the three transfectant lines upon removal of doxycycline. As shown in Fig. 3A, overexpression of kpm-wt induced an increase in cell population in G2/M phase and a decrease in cell population in G1 phase compared with non-induced culture. In contrast, there was no difference in the profile of cell cycle progression between non-induced and induced overexpression of kpm-kd or that of luciferase. To further analyze the kpm-induced cell cycle arrest and determine whether it was a G2/M transition arrest or a mitotic arrest, we performed scoring of mitotic index by MPM-2 assay that had long been used to identify mitotic cells. Overexpression of kpm-wt increased the cell proportion in G2/M phase as has been shown but with no significant changes in cell proportion in mitotic phase expressing MPM-2 antigen (Fig. 3B), indicating that overexpression of kpm-wt resulted in a G2/M transition arrest. Since the overexpression of kpm induced cell cycle arrest at the G2/M boundary, we next examined whether overexpression of kpm negatively regulated the kinase activity of the Cdc2-cyclin B complex. In parallel with the gene induction, cells were synchronized in prometaphase and metaphase by the nocodazole method. Western blotting with whole cell lysates showed that induction of kpm-wt, kpm-kd, or luciferase did not affect the total amounts of Cdc2 or cyclin B (Fig. 4A). Likewise, there was no particular difference in the amount of Cdc2 co-immunoprecipitated with cyclin B between non-induced and induced cells. However, the Cdc2-cyclin B complex of kpm-wt-induced cells showed much lower histone H1 phosphorylation acitivity than that of non-induced cells, while induction of kpm-kd or luciferase had no effect on the kinase activity (Fig. 4B). We repeated these experiments three times and obtained similar results. Synchronization by the double thymidine block did not work well with HeLa Tet-Off cells and gave only incomplete results (data not shown), which were nevertheless consistent with what we observed by the nocodazole method. As has been described elsewhere (26Draetta G. Beach D. Cell. 1988; 54: 17-26Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 27Ohashi A. Minami N. Imai H. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 65: 1195-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), Cdc2 co-immunoprecipitated with cyclin B consisted of a doublet of bands of which the upper one represented the hyperphosphorylated inactive form, and the lower one represented the dephosphorylated active form. As shown in Fig.4B, the proportion of the hyperphosphorylated inactive form of Cdc2 was increased in kpm-wt-induced cells, which was also demonstrated by Western blotting using a specific anti-phospho-Cdc2-Y15 antibody. These data suggest that Cdc2 bound to cyclin B remained or was rendered inactive by the phosphorylation at Thr-14 and Tyr-15, which seems to be the major mechanism of the G2/M arrest. We next investigated the possible involvement of Cdc25C in the down-regulation of the Cdc2-cyclin B kinase. It is known that in SDS-PAGE Cdc25C consists of an 85-kDa band of the hyperphosphorylated form with the highest phosphatase activity and a doublet of 60- and 57-kDa bands, which represent the Ser-216-phosphorylated inactive form and the dephosphorylated form with weak phosphatase activity, respectively (28Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Cell. 1992; 70: 139-151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 29Peng C.Y. Graves P.R. Thoma R.S. Wu Z. Shaw A.S. Piwnica-Worms H. Science. 1997; 277: 1501-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1189) Google Scholar). In parallel with gene induction, cells were synchronized in prometaphase and metaphase by the nocodazole method. Western blotting with whole cell lysates showed that the 85-kDa hyperphosphorylated active form as well as the doublet of Cdc25C were present in luciferase- or kpm-kd-induced cells as described above. In contrast, it was noted that the mitotic hyperphosphorylated form was almost undetectable and conversely the Ser-216-phosphorylated inactive form (the upper band of the doublet) was increased in kpm-wt-induced cells (Fig. 4C). These data suggest that Cdc25C remains or is rendered inactive by overexpression of kpm-wt resulting in the decrease in the activity of dephosphorylating Cdc2, which seems to be one of mechanisms of the inactivation of the Cdc2-cyclin B kinase. Because many tumor suppressor genes are known to inhibit cell growth by inducing apoptosis as well as cell cycle arrest, we examined whether this was also the case with kpm. In fact, induction of apoptosis by kpm was already suggested by cell cycle analysis in which an increase in sub-G1 phase cells with a DNA content less than 2 N was observed after an elongated induction of kpm-wt for more than 4 days (Table I). To demonstrate that this population was generated as a result of apoptosis, cells after kpm induction were first subjected to TUNEL assay. As shown in Fig.5A, an increase in TUNEL-positive cells was clearly detectable in kpm-wt-induced but not non-induced cells. Induction of kpm-kd or luciferase elicited no change in TUNEL-positive cells. Presence of apoptotic cells was confirmed by DAPI staining and immunofluorescence microscopy. Induction of kpm-wt resulted in chromatin condensation and segregation characteristics of apoptotic cells whereas that of kpm-kd or luciferase did not (Fig.5B).Table ISub-G1 populations in Luc-, kpm-wt-, or kpm-kd-induced cellsLuckpm-wtkpm-kdInduction−+−+−+Sub-G1(%)191921482019HeLa Tet-Off-Luc, -kpm-wt, or -kpm-kd cells were cultured for 5 days without doxycycline and then subjected to cell staining by propidium iodide.

Open table in a new tab HeLa Tet-Off-Luc, -kpm-wt, or -kpm-kd cells were cultured for 5 days without doxycycline and then subjected to cell staining by propidium iodide. Sub-G1 phase cells with a DNA content less than 2 N were counted by flow cytometry, which seemed to represent apoptotic cells and fragmented cell debris. We previously reported the molecular cloning of kpm, which encodes a putative human serine/threonine kinase homologous towarts/lats, a Drosophila tumor suppressor (1Hori T. Takaori-Kondo A. Kamikubo Y. Uchiyama T. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3101-3109Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Prior to our article, Tao et al. (11Tao W. Zhang S. Turenchalk G.S. Stewart R.A. St. John M.A. Chen W. Xu T. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) described a human as well as mouse homologue ofwarts/lats named LATS1 that could functionally compensate the defect of warts/latsin Drosophila. In contrast to LATS1 that has been extensively studied, the function of kpm remains largely unknown. It is to be determined whether kpm has similar or unique function compared with LATS1. In the present study, we established HeLa-derived stable transfectants of wild-type kpm (kpm-wt), a kinase-dead mutant of kpm (kpm-kd), and luciferase under the control of tetracycline-responsive promoter in order to define the biological function of kpm. Using this system (16Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4256) Google Scholar,30Stebbins M.J. Urlinger S. Byrne G. Bello B. Hillen W. Yin J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10775-10780Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), we demonstrated that overexpression of kpm-wt resulted in suppression of cell proliferation due to cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase and subsequent apoptotic cell death. Cell cycle analysis combined with MPM-2 assay clearly showed that overexpression of kpm-wt induced a cell cycle arrest by blockade of G2/M transition rather than delaying progress of mitosis. Consistent with this, we showed that the histone H1 kinase activity of the Cdc2-cyclin B complex was markedly diminished in kpm-wt-induced cells. Furthermore, Cdc2 bound to cyclin B remained or was rendered phosphorylated at Tyr-15 in kpm-induced cells. It is well known that the transition between the G2 phase and mitosis is regulated through inhibitory phosphorylation of the Cdc2 kinase (31O'Connor P.M. Ferris D.K. Pagano M. Draetta G. Pines J. Hunter T. Longo D.L. Kohn K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8298-8308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,32Rhind N. Furnari B. Russell P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 504-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Since overexpression of kpm-wt did not change the protein levels of Cdc2 and cyclin B in the whole cell lysates as well as in the immunoprecipitates by anti-cyclin B, it seems likely that overexpression of kpm led to a cell cycle arrest at G2/M by increasing the ratio of the hyperphosphorylated inactive form of Cdc2. We examined whether Cdc25C was involved in the inactivation of Cdc2 because it is established that phosphorylated Cdc2 is dephosphorylated by this dual-specific phosphatase. Western blot analysis showed that overexpression of kpm-wt resulted in a marked decrease in the hyperphosphorylated active form of Cdc25C and an increase in the Ser-216-phosphorylated inactive form. Considering that 14-3-3 proteins bind to phosphoserine 216 of Cdc25C and translocate it from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, the overall phosphatase activity of Cdc25C should be strongly down-regulated in kpm-wt-induced cells, which seems to be one of the mechanisms of the increase in phosphorylated inactive form of Cdc2. Although we do not exclude other possible mechanisms for the kpm-induced cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase, it is certain that the kinase activity of kpm itself plays the central role in such a putative phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cascade, because kpm-kd had no effect. LATS1 has also been reported to inhibit cell growth and induce cell cycle arrest in G2/M (33Yang X. Li D.M. Chen W. Xu T. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6516-6523Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 34Xia H. Qi H. Li Y. Pei J. Barton J. Blackstad M. Xu T. Tao W. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1233-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of the cell cycle arrest in LATS1 overexpression is different from that of kpm described here. According to Tao et al. (11Tao W. Zhang S. Turenchalk G.S. Stewart R.A. St. John M.A. Chen W. Xu T. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) LATS1 could associate with Cdc2 and competitively inhibit the binding of cyclin B to Cdc2, which resulted in a decrease in kinase activity of the Cdc2-cyclin B complex. In addition, ectopic expression of LATS1 in MCF-7 cells has been reported to induce specific down-regulation of protein levels of cyclin A and cyclin B, while no effect was found on cyclin E, Cdc2, CDK2, p27KIP, and p21CIP levels (34Xia H. Qi H. Li Y. Pei J. Barton J. Blackstad M. Xu T. Tao W. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1233-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The discrepancy between kpm and LATS1 may be simply because these two molecules are distinct from each other. The experimental systems were also different, in which we used a tetracycline-responsive gene expression system in HeLa-derived cells (30Stebbins M.J. Urlinger S. Byrne G. Bello B. Hillen W. Yin J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10775-10780Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 35Rennel E. Gerwins P. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 309: 79Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) whereas LATS1 overexpression was induced by transduction of fibroblasts and other cancer cells using adenovirus vectors (33Yang X. Li D.M. Chen W. Xu T. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6516-6523Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 34Xia H. Qi H. Li Y. Pei J. Barton J. Blackstad M. Xu T. Tao W. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1233-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). We do not exclude the possibility that kpm has the capacity to associate with Cdc2 although we have not been able to demonstrate the association of these moleculesin vivo. However, the data presented here clearly indicated that, at least in this system and in HeLa cells, the cell cycle arrest at G2/M transition is not mediated by the competitive inhibition of binding between Cdc2 and cyclin B but rather by the increase in the ratio of phosphorylated inactive form of Cdc2 bound to cyclin B. Thus, the present study has revealed the presence of a novel pathway of G2/M regulation through kpm and the Cdc2-cyclin B complex. It is likely that the function of kpm is not restricted to the regulation of the Cdc2-cyclin B kinase. In fact, we showed that overexpression of kpm induced apoptotic cell death after cell cycle arrest. With regard to this, our preliminary experiments have suggested that expression of Bcl-2 protein is specifically downregulated after 3 days of kpm-wt induction (data not shown) although the signaling cascade leading to apoptosis from kpm overexpression remains unclear. In particular, the relationship between the cell cycle arrest and the induction of apoptosis needs to be investigated. On the other hand, a new cytoplasmic protein named salvador (hWW45, a WW domain containing-gene) has recently been described that interacts with LATS1 to cause both cell cycle arrest in G1/S as well as G2/M and apoptotic cell death (36Tapon N.

Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 990-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). kpm also has a PPXY motif (1Hori T. Takaori-Kondo A. Kamikubo Y. Uchiyama T.

https://openalex.org/W2003094067,"Hypoxia causes several renal tubular dysfunctions, including abnormal handling of potassium and sodium and increased blood pressure. Therefore, we investigated the impact of hypoxia on 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11beta-HSD2) enzyme, a crucial prereceptor gatekeeper for renal glucocorticosteroid-mediated mineralocorticoid action. The effect of hypoxia was assessed in vitro by incubating LLC-PK1 cells with antimycin A, an inhibitor of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Antimycin A induced a dose- and time-dependent reduction of 11beta-HSD2 activity. The early growth response gene, Egr-1, a gene known to be stimulated by hypoxia was investigated because of a potential Egr-1 binding site in the promoter region of 11beta-HSD2. Antimycin A induced Egr-1 protein and Egr-1-regulated luciferase gene expression. This induction was prevented with the MAPKK inhibitor PD 98059. Overexpression of Egr-1 reduced endogenous 11beta-HSD2 activity in LLC-PK1 cells, indicating that MAPK ERK is involved in the regulation of 11beta-HSD2 in vitro. In vivo experiments in rats revealed that Egr-1 protein increases, whereas 11beta-HSD2 mRNA decreases, in kidney tissue after unilateral renal ischemia and in humans the renal activity of 11beta-HSD2 as assessed by the urinary ratio of (tetrahydrocortisol+5alpha-tetrahydrocortisol)/tetrahydrocortisone declined when volunteers were exposed to hypoxemia at high altitude up to 7000 m. Thus, hypoxia decreases 11beta-HSD2 transcription and activity by inducing Egr-1 in vivo and in vitro. This mechanism might account for enhanced renal sodium retention and hypertension associated with hypoxic conditions."

As one means of addressing this question, we have determined the affinities and number of adenosine di- and triphosphate binding sites within MutS. Nitrocellulose filter binding assay and equilibrium fluorescence anisotropy measurements have demonstrated that MutS has one high affinity binding site for ADP and one high affinity site for nonhydrolyzable ATP analogues per dimer equivalent. Low concentrations of 5′-adenylylimidodiphosphate (AMPPNP) promote ADP binding and a large excess of AMPPNP is required to displace ADP from the protein. Fluorescence energy transfer and filter binding assays indicate that ADP and nonhydrolyzable ATP analogues can bind simultaneously to adjacent subunits within the MutS oligomer with affinities in the low micromolar range. These findings suggest that the protein exists primarily as the ATP·MutS·ADP ternary complex in solution and that this may be the form of the protein that is involved in DNA encountersin vivo.

The key protein responsible for initiation of this reaction is MutS, which recognizes mismatched base pairs (9Su S.-S. Lahue R.S. Au K.G. Modrich P. J. Biol.

In addition to its mismatch recognition function, MutS has a carboxyl-terminal ATPase that is required for function of the protein in mismatch repair (11Haber L.T. Walker G.C.

For members of the ABC family, shared motifs around the nucleotide binding domain comprise an integral part of a subunit-subunit interface (17Jones P.M. George A.M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 179: 187-202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As a consequence, nucleotide binding and hydrolysis within one subunit can induce conformational changes across this interface to cooperatively influence nucleotide binding and hydrolysis by the other (19Hou Y.

While the MutS ATPase center is required for function of the protein in mismatch repair, the functional roles of nucleotide binding and hydrolysis in modulating interaction of the protein with DNA is controversial. Several possible functions for the ATPase have been suggested in this regard. One class of model is based on the observation that ATP promotes release of bacterial MutS and human MutSα from the mismatch, resulting in movement of the proteins along the helix contour (25Allen D.J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 34339-34347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This movement has been postulated to play a role in signaling between the mismatch and the secondary DNA site that serves as the strand signal that directs repair. This sort of model is appealing because it accounts for the preferential utilization of proximal strand signals (7Cooper D.L. Lahue R.S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11823-11829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Bruni R. Martin D. Jiricny J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 4875-4890Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and for the fact that the excision system is loaded at the strand signal with an orientation bias (31Dao V. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9202-9207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Two distinct mechanisms for MutS homolog movement along the helix have been suggested. One model posits directional movement along the helix that is coupled to ATP binding and hydrolysis by the DNA-bound protein (25Allen D.J. Makhov A. Grilley M. Taylor J. Thresher R. Modrich P. Griffith J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4467-4476Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The problem with this proposal is that it is difficult to reconcile the rate of MutS movement along the helix (several hundred to several thousand base pairs per minute) with the modest turnover rate of its ATPase (about 4 min−1 per monomer equivalent in the presence of heteroduplex) (24Bjornson K.P. Allen D.J. Modrich P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3176-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 25Allen D.J. Makhov A. Grilley M. Taylor J. Thresher R. Modrich P. Griffith J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4467-4476Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). However, a mechanism that supports directional movement along the helix with limited energy input has been suggested (26Blackwell L.J. Martik D. Bjornson K.P. Bjornson E.S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32055-32062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Study of human MutSα has led to proposal of a molecular switch model for movement of MutS homologs along the helix. This mechanism postulates mismatch recognition by the MutS·ADP complex, with the mispair promoting exchange of ADP for ATP (27Gradia S. Subramanian D. Wilson T. Acharya S. Makhov A. Griffith J. Fishel R. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 255-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 32Gradia S. Acharya S. Fishel R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3922-3930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Since the resulting MutS·ATP complex is envisioned to freely diffuse along the helix, the modest turnover number of the MutS ATPase is readily accommodated within this model. On the other hand, several lines of evidence indicate that movement of MutS homologs from the mismatch is dependent on ATP hydrolysis by the heteroduplex-bound protein (25Allen D.J. Makhov A. Grilley M. Taylor J. Thresher R. Modrich P. Griffith J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4467-4476Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 26Blackwell L.J. Martik D. Bjornson K.P. Bjornson E.S. Modrich P. J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 2080-2086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). A distinct function for the MutS ATPase that does not invoke movement of the protein along the helix has also been described (15Junop M.S. Obmolova G. Rausch K. Hsieh P. Yang W. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 33Schofield M.J. Nayak S. Scott T.H. Du C. Hsieh P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 22: 28291-28299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (116) Google Scholar). This model invokes ATPase function in a kinetic proofreading process that enhances mismatch specificity of MutS-DNA interaction. In this proposal, ATP binding by DNA-bound MutS preferentially reduces the affinity of the protein for homoduplex sequences, leading to abortion of an incorrect recognition complex that might occur at a canonical Watson-Crick base pair. The model also suggests that ATP binding by heteroduplex-bound MutS serves to verify mismatch recognition. The finding that ATP promotes release of MutS homologs from a mismatch (22Gradia S.

Bjornson K.P. Allen D.J. Modrich P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34339-34347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) are seemingly incompatible with these ideas. To some extent, these disparate models reflect the lack of information concerning the effects of ATP binding and hydrolysis and, hence, potential states of nucleotide occupancy on MutS-DNA interaction. Structural studies of carboxyl-terminal MutS truncations have shown that the MutS dimer is capable of mismatch recognition and that the two subunits within dimer·heteroduplex complex are not equivalent (13Obmolova G. Ban C. Hsieh P. Yang W. Nature. 2000; 407: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar,14Lamers M.H. Perrakis A. Enzlin J.H. Winterwerp H.H. de Wind N. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2000; 407: 711-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). Consequently, the two nucleotide binding sites within the MutS dimer can potentially be filled in nine different ways (37Sixma T.K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent work indicates that MutS dimers undergo a concentration-dependent assembly reaction that is promoted by binding of nucleotide or heteroduplex DNA, probably to a tetramer end state (14Lamers M.H. Perrakis A. Enzlin J.H. Winterwerp H.H. de Wind N. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2000; 407: 711-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar, 24Bjornson K.P. Allen D.J. Modrich P.

Bjornson, T. Polhaus, J. Warren, J. Genschel, L. Beese, and P. Modrich, unpublished observations. This dramatically increases the complexity of the system. To clarify potential nucleotide occupancy states of the protein, we have determined the number and the affinities of di- and triphosphate binding sites within MutS. We show that MutS binds ADP and non-hydrolyzable ATP analogues with similar affinities, that the protein has one high affinity ADP site and one high affinity triphosphate site per dimer equivalent, and that di- and triphosphate binding sites can be simultaneously occupied. MutS preparations were those described previously (29Blackwell L.J. Bjornson K.P. Allen D.J. Modrich P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34339-34347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Concentrations of the protein are expressed in terms of monomer equivalents. [2,8-3H]ADP (33.9 Ci/mmol) and [35S]ATPγS (adenosine 5′ (γ-thio) triphosphate, 1250 Ci/mmol) were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. [α-32P]AMPPNP (5′-adenylylimidodiphosphate, 50 Ci/mmol) was from ICN. BODIPY FL (2′ or 3′)-AMPPNP and BODIPY TR (2′ or 3′)-ADP (custom synthesis) were purchased from Molecular Probes. Nucleotide binding assays were performed using a modified Schleicher and Schuell 96-well filter apparatus (38Wong I. Lohman T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5428-5432Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), which was stored at 4 °C prior to use. Nitrocellulose membranes (PROTRAN BA85, Schleicher and Schuell) were briefly soaked in 0.4 m KOH, extensively rinsed with distilled water until the pH was neutral, and then equilibrated with binding buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6 (determined at 4.0 °C), 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% (v/v) glycerol). Binding reactions (100 μl) containing nucleotides and MutS as indicated were allowed to equilibrate on ice for 10 min. Thirty-μl samples of each binding reaction were applied to three different wells, filtered (filtration time less than 10 s), and then rinsed with 100 μl of binding buffer. Affinity measurements for [3H]ADP and [32P]AMPPNP were performed using only radiolabeled nucleotides, whereas the stoichiometric binding experiments contained a fixed amount of radiolabeled nucleotide (<0.5 μm), which was isotopically diluted with unlabeled nucleotide (ADP, USB Corp.; AMPPNP, ICN: ATPγS, Calbiochem-Novabiochem) to yield the desired concentration. After filtration, the nitrocellulose membrane was blotted dry and further dried under a heat lamp. For single label experiments, [3H]ADP and [32P]AMPPNP binding was quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software with a low energy PhosphorImager screen used for the former isotope. For dual label experiments using [35S]ATPγS and [3H]ADP, filter-retained radioactivity was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting, and counts in the tritium channel were corrected for a 5% spillover from the 35S channel. Nucleotide-MutS interaction under stoichiometric binding conditions was analyzed by nonlinear regression fit (39Marquardt D.W. J. Soc. Indust. Appl. Math. 1963; 11: 431-441Crossref Google Scholar) to Equation 1.[SA]=Kd+At+St−(−Kd−At−St)2−4StAt2Equation 1 [SA] is the concentration of bound nucleotide,At is the total added nucleotide concentration,Kd is the dissociation constant for nucleotide binding, and St is the total concentration of available nucleotide binding sites that was determined in this analysis. Binding of BODIPY FL (2′ or 3′)-AMPPNP and BODIPY TR (2′ or 3′)-ADP to MutS was monitored by equilibrium fluorescence anisotropy determination using an SLM 8100 fluorometer (Jobin Yvon, Inc.) equipped with Glan-Thomson calcite polarizers. Reactions contained binding buffer (above), 100 nm fluorescent nucleotide, and MutS as indicated. BODIPY FL (2′ or 3′)-AMPPNP was excited at 490 nm, and fluorescence emission determined at 514 nm, whereas the BODIPY TR (2′ or 3′)-ADP fluorophore was excited at 590 nm, and emission measured at 620 nm. Anisotropy measurements were taken in the L-format using binding buffer as blank and correcting for the instrument G-factor as described (40Lakowicz J.R. 2nd Ed. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York1999: 368-391Google Scholar). The theoretical value forR0, the distance between the energy transfer pair which gives a 50% efficiency, was calculated from overlap of the emission spectra of the donor, BODIPY FL (2′ or 3′)-AMPPNP (arbitrary units versus wavelength) with the excitation spectra of the acceptor, BODIPY TR (2′ or 3′)-ADP (extinction coefficientversus wavelength). R0 was calculated from physical constants and the overlap integral using Equation 2(40Lakowicz J.R. 2nd Ed. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York1999: 368-391Google Scholar).R06=9000·(ln10)·κ2·QD128·π5·N·n4×∫0∞FD(λ)·ɛA(λ)·λ4dλ∫0∞FD(λ)dλEquation 2 QD is the quantum yield of the donor, BODIPY FL (2′ or 3′)-AMPPNP for which a value of 0.9 was used. The κ2 parameter is a factor relating the relative orientation of the transition dipoles of the donor and acceptor. A value of 2/3 was used, assuming random dynamic averaging of donor and acceptor dipoles. Although this assumption may not be valid in all cases, the sixth root dependence R0 on κ2 limits the potential error in the calculated distance to less than 36% (40Lakowicz J.R. 2nd Ed. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York1999: 368-391Google Scholar). N is Avogadro's number andn is the refractive index of the medium, for which a value of 1.33 was used. The overlap integral was calculated numerically using the program Kaleidagraph and normalized by dividing by the total integrated area under the emission spectra. Substitution of these values into Equation 2 yielded an R0 distance of 38.1 Å for this donor-acceptor pair. The efficiency, E, of fluorescence energy transfer (FRET) between BODIPY FL (2′ or 3′)-AMPPNP (donor) and BODIPY TR (2′ or 3′)-ADP (acceptor) was obtained using the Ratio A procedure as described (41Clegg R.M. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 211: 353-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). Using this method the efficiency, E, of fluorescence energy transfer can be determined in a single cuvette by measuring the ratio of the fluorescence intensity of the acceptor when the donor is excited (490 nm) to the fluorescence intensity observed upon direct excitation of the acceptor (590 nm) as shown in Equation3.RatioA=E·d+·ɛFL(490nm)ɛTR(590nm)+ɛTR(490nm)ɛTR(590nm)Equation 3 The fluorescence intensity at 620 nm contains emission intensity due to energy transfer as well as some spillover fluorescence intensity from the emission of the donor. To correct for this non-FRET contribution, the fluorescence spectra of the donor was subtracted from the FRET emission spectra using the SLM 8100 software as described (41Clegg R.M. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 211: 353-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). Ratio A is the ratio of the corrected fluoresce intensity of the acceptor, BODIPY TR (2′ or 3′)-ADP at 620 nm upon donor excitation at 490 nm divided by the fluorescence intensity of the acceptor, BODIPY TR (2′ or 3′)-ADP upon direct excitation (no FRET) at 590 nm. The term d+ is the efficiency of donor labeling for which a value of unity was used. This term will be less than unity if less than 100% of donor and acceptor-labeled nucleotides are bound by MutS (see “Results”). The factor εFL(490 nm)/εTR(590 nm) is the ratio of the extinction coefficients of the donor at 490 nm and the acceptor at 590 nm and was experimentally determined as 0.51. The last term in Equation 3 is the ratio of the fluorescence intensity of the acceptor upon excitation at 490 nm to that observed when excitation was at 590 nm, for which a value of 0.036 was experimentally determined. Using Equation 3, the efficiency, E, can be calculated upon the determination of Ratio A. The efficiency of energy transfer was converted into the molecular distanceR, separating the donor and acceptor pair using Equation 4(40Lakowicz J.R. 2nd Ed. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York1999: 368-391Google Scholar).R=1−EE6·R0Equation 4 Nucleotide binding by MutS was examined by filter assay using radiolabeled ADP and nonhydrolyzable AMPPNP and by fluorescent anisotropy determination using nucleotides chemically modified with the BODIPY (FL or TR) fluorophore on the 2′ or 3′ positions of the ribose moiety (see “Experimental Procedures”). The latter method is based on the observation that whereas free nucleotides have a low anisotropy in solution, binding to MutS leads to an approximate 8-fold increase in this parameter. As shown in Fig. 1, similar binding profiles were obtained with radiolabeled and fluorophore-tagged nucleotides, indicating that the derivatization of ADP and AMPPNP with the BODIPY fluorophore has little effect on nucleotide binding by MutS. As judged by either assay method, the MutS concentration where half of the nucleotide is bound is ∼1 μm for both ADP and AMPPNP. Because these experiments were performed by titrating a fixed nucleotide concentration with a multivalent protein, this analysis addresses only the highest affinity nucleotide binding site(s) within the MutS oligomer. Inspection of ADP and AMPPNP binding profiles at low MutS concentrations (0–0.2 μm) reveals that the curves are sigmoidal in shape, indicating an apparent increase in nucleotide affinity with increasing MutS concentration. This observation is consistent with the finding that MutS dimer oligomerization in this concentration range is promoted by the presence of ATP (24Bjornson K.P. Allen D.J. Modrich P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3176-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The stoichiometry of ADP and AMPPNP binding was determined by nucleotide titration of a high fixed concentration of the protein (10 μm monomer, Fig. 2). Under these conditions binding is expected to be essentially stoichiometric. This analysis yielded stoichiometries of 2.1 ± 0.2 MutS monomers/ADP and 2.4 ± 0.3 MutS monomers/AMPPNP, suggesting that only half of the nucleotide binding sites within the protein are available for binding of ADP or the triphosphate. This finding is in agreement with structural analysis of heteroduplex-protein co-crystals obtained in the presence of ADP withE. coli MutS800, a carboxyl-terminal truncation that oligomerizes to yield dimers only (14Lamers M.H. Perrakis A. Enzlin J.H. Winterwerp H.H. de Wind N. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2000; 407: 711-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). ADP occupancy is restricted to one MutS subunit within the DNA·(MutS800)2 complex (14Lamers M.H. Perrakis A. Enzlin J.H. Winterwerp H.H. de Wind N. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2000; 407: 711-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar,37Sixma T.K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Using titration assay, we have confirmed half-site occupancy for ADP binding by MutS800 (2.9 ± 0.3 MutS800 monomers/ADP) in the absence of DNA and have obtained similar results with AMPPNP (2.2 ± 0.3 MutS800 monomers/AMPPNP, Fig. 2). These observations suggest that half-site nucleotide specificity is determined at the dimer level. The experiments described above indicate one high affinity ADP binding site and one high affinity triphosphate binding site per MutS dimer equivalent. Since ADP and AMPPNP bind to MutS with similar affinities (Fig. 1), each nucleotide should be a highly effective competitor of the other if both bind to a common site. Fig.3 shows a competition binding study in which MutS-bound [3H]ADP was examined as a function of increasing concentrations of unlabeled ADP or AMPPNP. Under initial conditions (4 μm MutS and 2 μm[3H]ADP), the [3H]ADP was only partially bound, and as expected, addition of unlabeled ADP competed for binding of the radiolabeled diphosphate. By contrast, [3H]ADP binding by MutS was potentiated by low concentrations of AMPPNP (< 5 μm). Significant AMPPNP competition was evident only when the triphosphate analogue was present at 10-fold molar excess over [3H]ADP, and near complete competition was observed at 100-fold excess. In view of the similar affinities of MutS for the ADP and AMPPNP (Fig. 1), the pattern of AMPPNP competition is inconsistent with the possibility that the two nucleotides share a common high affinity site. Indeed, the potentiation of [3H]ADP binding observed at low AMPPNP concentrations indicates that the two nucleotides bind simultaneously to distinct sites with apparent positive cooperativity. A similar cooperative interaction has been demonstrated for the nucleotide binding centers of the multidrug resistance protein MRP1, another ABC superfamily member (19Hou Y. Cui L. Riordan J.R. Chang X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20280-20287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 20Hou Y.X. Cui L. Riordan J.R. Chang X.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5110-5119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). While these observations indicate the presence of distinct di- and triphosphate binding sites within MutS, the specificity of these sites is not absolute as judged by the ability of high concentrations of AMPPNP to compete with ADP binding. To further address the possibility that di- and triphosphate binding involves distinct, high affinity sites within the MutS oligomer, we asked whether the protein is capable of binding ADP and AMPPNP simultaneously. These experiments exploited the fact that BODIPY FL (2′ or 3′)-AMPPNP and BODIPY TR (2′ or 3′)-ADP form a fluorescence energy transfer pair. As shown in Fig. 4, the emission spectrum of the donor BODIPY FL (2′ or 3′)-AMPPNP overlaps the absorption spectrum of the BODIPY TR (2′ or 3′)-ADP acceptor. The overlap integral shown in Fig. 4 permits calculation ofR0, the distance between the donor and acceptor that yields 50% energy transfer efficiency (40Lakowicz J.R. 2nd Ed. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York1999: 368-391Google Scholar), for which a value of 38.1 Å was obtained (see “Experimental Procedures”). Fig. 5 shows the fluorescence emission spectrum of an equimolar (4 μm) mixture of the BODIPY FL (2′ or 3′)-AMPPNP and BODIPY TR (2′ or 3′)-ADP upon excitation at 490 nm (AMPPNP donor excitation). As can be seen, the emission intensity is almost exclusively that of the donor at 514 nm, and there is no discernable peak at the wavelength (620 nm) expected for emission of the BODIPY TR (2′ or 3′)-ADP acceptor. However, addition of 8 μm (monomer) MutS or MutS800, resulted in a decrease in donor emission at 514 nm and a concomitant appearance of fluorescence intensity at 620 nm as expected for acceptor emission. Furthermore, the sensitized emission at 620 nm observed in the presence of MutS and MutS800 was largely abolished by addition of excess ATP, and this was accompanied by partial restoration of donor emission at 514 nm. These observations are consistent with MutS bringing ADP and AMPPNP into proximity by virtue of simultaneous binding of the two nucleotides. By taking the ratio of the sensitized emission intensity of the acceptor (Fig. 5, inset) to that obtained by directly exciting the acceptor molecule bound to MutS or MutS800 (data not shown), the efficiency of energy transfer was determined (Equation 3, “Experimental Procedures” (41Clegg R.M. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 211: 353-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar)). The efficiency calculated in this manner is 25% for both MutS and MutS800, corresponding to a 46-Å separation between the fluorophores on the BODIPY FL (2′ or 3′)-AMPPNP donor and BODIPY TR (2′ or 3′)-ADP acceptor (Equation 4, “Experimental Procedures”). This distance estimate represents an upper limit because it assumes 100% binding of both nucleotides as well as 100% labeling efficiency of the AMPPNP donor molecule (thatd+ = 1 in Equation 4). If these assumptions are not valid, then the actual distance between the nucleotides would be less than 46 Å. Since assembly of MutS800 is restricted to dimer formation (13Obmolova G. Ban C. Hsieh P. Yang W. Nature. 2000; 407: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar, 14Lamers M.H. Perrakis A. Enzlin J.H. Winterwerp H.H. de Wind N. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2000; 407: 711-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar), the similar energy transfer efficiencies for native MutS and the MutS800 indicate that simultaneous ADP and AMPPNP binding occurs at the dimer level and does not depend on oligomerization of this species. The possibility that MutS di- and triphosphate binding sites can be simultaneously occupied was confirmed by filter binding assay using differentially radiolabeled ADP and ATPγS. Complexes between MutS (10 μm) and [35S]ATPγS (5 μm) were prepared (Fig. 6). Since this [35S]ATPγS concentration is 25 times theKd (0.2 μm, data not shown), binding was near stoichiometric, and essentially all the input label was recovered as filter-retained complexes in the presence of MutS. As shown in Fig. 6, titration of [35S]ATPγS·MutS complexes with [3H]ADP led to retention of both nucleotides on the filter, and the yield of MutS-bound [35S]ATPγS was unaffected by [3H]ADP addition until the diphosphate concentration equaled that of [35S]ATPγS. Further [3H]ADP addition resulted in a modest reduction of [35S]ATPγS binding, consistent with the competition results shown in Fig. 3. The apparent stoichiometry of [3H]ADP·MutS complex formation determined from this analysis is 2.3 ± 0.2 MutS monomers per ADP bound, in good agreement with that observed in the absence of the ATP analogue (2.1 ± 0.2 monomers per ADP, Fig. 2). These results demonstrate that MutS can simultaneously bind ADP and ATPγS when protein and nucleotide concentrations are in the low micromolar range. Structural analysis of the E. coli MutS800 complex with heteroduplex DNA and ADP has demonstrated asymmetry with respect to interaction of the two subunits with DNA and with nucleotide (14Lamers M.H. Perrakis A. Enzlin J.H. Winterwerp H.H. de Wind N. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2000; 407: 711-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar, 37Sixma T.K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Whereas the nucleotide binding site is occupied within the MutS800 subunit responsible for mismatch recognition, the nucleotide binding center within the other subunit is empty. This ADP binding stoichiometry is recapitulated in the solution studies described here. Since our experiments were performed in the absence of DNA, it is clear that half-site ADP occupancy does not depend on the presence of DNA. Binding of nonhydrolyzable AMPPNP and ATPγS (data not shown) also displays a similar half-site stoichiometry, and the diphosphate and triphosphate sites can be simultaneously and differentially occupied at nucleotide concentrations in the low micromolar range. The specificity of the sites is not absolute, however, because high concentrations of AMPPNP can displace ADP from MutS (Fig. 3) and excess ADP competes weakly for ATPγS binding (Fig. 6). Differential and simultaneous occupancy of nucleotide binding sites have been reported for other members of the ABC superfamily. For example, cross-linking of azido-ATP to MRP1 is stimulated by ADP up to equimolar amounts, although excess ADP inhibits the cross-linking reaction (19Hou Y. Cui L. Riordan J.R. Chang X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20280-20287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 20Hou Y.X. Cui L. Riordan J.R. Chang X.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5110-5119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These results are similar to our finding that AMPPNP increases ADP binding but competes for ADP binding when present in excess (Fig. 3). Further studies will be required to determine whether the observed heterogeneity in MutS binding site specificities reflects a stable asymmetry in the oligomer that is maintained during steady-state ATP hydrolysis or whether the individual subunits alternate specificity in an ordered fashion. Precedent for both possibilities has been documented with other ABC transporters. For example, nucleotide hydrolysis by P-glycoprotein has been attributed to a catalytic cycle in which the two subunits alternately bind and hydrolyze ATP (42Senior A.E. Acta Physiol. Scand. Suppl. 1998; 643: 213-218PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, the nucleotide centers of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator function in a different manner, with one of the two distinct domains supporting more rapid hydrolytic turnover than the other (43Aleksandrov L. Aleksandrov A.A. Chang X.B. Riordan J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15419-15425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). We presume that the MutS·adenine nucleotide complexes described here reflect occupancy states that occur during the course of ATP hydrolysis by the protein. Pre-steady-state analysis of ATP hydrolysis by MutS in the absence of DNA has demonstrated a burst of ADP production during the first hydrolytic turnover that is substoichiometric with respect to the available number of MutS monomer equivalents (24Bjornson K.P. Allen D.J. Modrich P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3176-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Although the basis of this effect has not been established, this observation indicates that only a subset of MutS protomers is capable of ATP hydrolysis at any given instant. Because the ADP burst indicates that the rate-limiting step for turnover occurs after hydrolysis, it is also clear that a hydrolytically active protomer spends most of its lifetime as the ADP complex in the absence of mismatched DNA. Given the millimolar concentrations of ATP in vivo, available triphosphate binding sites would certainly be filled under these conditions. Since we have shown that MutS supports simultaneous binding of di- and triphosphate, these arguments strongly suggest that the protein exists predominantly as an ATP·MutS·ADP ternary complex in solution. This suggestion is in contrast to the molecular switch model that restricts nucleotide occupancy to either the MutS·ADP or MutS·ATP complex (27Gradia S. Subramanian D. Wilson T. Acharya S. Makhov A. Griffith J. Fishel R. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 255-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Recognition of the multivalent nature of MutS with regard to nucleotide occupancy allows for the possibility of multiple roles for ATP binding and hydrolysis to coordinate the intricate functions attributed to MutS in the mismatch repair pathway. Indeed, distinct roles for ATP binding and hydrolysis have already been proposed. ATP and ADP binding by MutS is coupled to tetramer formation (Ref. 24Bjornson K.P. Allen D.J. Modrich P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3176-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar and Fig. 1), whereas ATP hydrolysis has been postulated to be involved in the production of mobile complexes on DNA (25Allen D.J.

ATP binding is also postulated to function in a signaling manner to promote the recruitment of downstream repair activities like MutL (34Grilley M. Welsh K.M. Su S.-S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1000-1004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Galio L. Bouquet C. Brooks P.

Chem. 1998; 273: 23176-23182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). As noted above, the complex with bound diphosphate and triphosphate may represent the form of the enzyme that encounters DNA. In the crystal structure of the MutS·ADP· heteroduplex complex the protein envelops the DNA in a clamp-like channel (14Lamers M.H. Perrakis A. Enzlin J.H. Winterwerp H.H. de Wind N. Sixma T.K.

However, the distance between the nucleotide binding sites in the ATP·MutS·ADP complex measured by FRET (≈46 Å, Fig. 5) in the absence of DNA is greater than that in the MutS·ADP·heteroduplex crystalline complex (≈20 Å, (14Lamers M.H. Perrakis A. Enzlin J.H. Winterwerp H.H. de Wind N. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2000; 407: 711-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar, 37Sixma T.K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar)). Although the separation distance estimated by FRET is a maximum value, an attractive hypothesis is that the ATP·MutS·ADP complex represents an open form of the protein that allows DNA to enter the heteroduplex binding site. Further studies will be required to test this idea. However, proposals concerning the role of ATP binding and hydrolysis by MutS in mismatch repair must consider the complexity inherent in the possibility of differential occupancy of multiple nucleotide binding sites."

Much information has been gathered on the homeostasis mechanisms of glucose regulation by insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells. Here we demonstrate high expression levels of gelatinase B (matrix metalloproteinase-9, MMP-9) by neutrophils in acute pancreatitis and by ductular epithelial cells in chronic pancreatitis. Because gelatinase B processes cytokines and chemokines, we investigated whether and how gelatinase B cleaves insulin. Pure human neutrophil gelatinase B was found to destroy insulin by cleavage at 10 sites. Pancreatic islet and ductular cells are relatively spared in comparison with the complete destruction of acinar cells of the exocrine pancreas in chronic pancreatitis. High expression levels of gelatinase B are maintained in the immediate proximity of insulin-secreting beta cells. Consequently, diabetes may be worsened by enzymatic degradation of insulin by gelatinase B and by the consequent enhancement of the autoimmune process. Gelatinase B is diabetogenic in acute and chronic pancreatitis by cleaving insulin."

In contrast, mutation in Crm1p results in nuclear accumulation of Gln3p and up-regulation of Gln3p-dependent genes (11Carvalho J. Bertram P.G. Wente S.R. Zheng X.F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25359-25365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The transport of Gln3p also involves the Ran GTPase pathway as a mutation in the yeast Ran GTPase activating protein, Rna1p, causes Gln3p to remain in the cytoplasm in the presence of rapamycin (11Carvalho J. Bertram P.G. Wente S.R. Zheng X.F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25359-25365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Srp1p preferentially interacts with the hypophosphorylated Gln3p (11Carvalho J. Bertram P.G. Wente S.R. Zheng X.F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25359-25365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), suggesting that phosphorylation controls Gln3p nuclear import by regulating the interaction between Gln3p and Srp1p.Although previous research has revealed key insights into Gln3p, a detailed understanding of the mechanism by which TOR and Ure2p regulate Gln3p nuclear translocation is lacking. In this study, we performed structure-function analysis on Gln3p. Here we report that Gln3p contains classic nuclear localization signal (NLS) and nuclear export signal (NES) sequences that are necessary for its interaction with Srp1p and Crm1p, respectively, and TOR-regulated nuclear transport. We also identified an N-terminal region of amino acids critical for Gln3p interaction with its inhibitor Ure2p and a C-terminal Tor1p-binding domain. Finally, we localized a lysine/arginine-rich motif crucial for a rapamycin-sensitive function that is unrelated to Gln3p localization. These results provide a detailed understanding of Gln3p structure and function.RESULTSTo define sequences that are important for Gln3p localization and function, we performed systematic deletion analysis of Gln3p-MYC9 (Fig.1A).GLN3-MYC9 under the GLN3 promoter on a single copy plasmid is expressed at the physiological level and can complement the gln3Δ mutation in all possible tests (11Carvalho J. Bertram P.G. Wente S.R. Zheng X.F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25359-25365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Wild type and mutant GLN3-MYC9 were expressed in the gln3Δ strain. We have previously found that thegln3Δ mutant is significantly resistant to rapamycin (Fig.1B) (8Bertram P.G. Choi J. Carvalho J. Ai W.D. Zeng C.B. Chan T.F. Zheng X.F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35727-35733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 12Bertram P.G. Choi J.H. Carvalho J. Chan T.-F.

A. 2000; 97: 13227-13232Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Expression ofGLN3-MYC9 restored rapamycin sensitivity to the wild type strain level (Fig. 1A). Therefore, we decided to use the rapamycin sensitivity phenotype to evaluate the function of different Gln3p mutants in this study. We found that cells expressing a Gln3p-MYC9 mutant without the first 101 amino acids were still sensitive to rapamycin (Fig. 1, A and B). However, cells expressing Gln3p mutants with a deletion of 200 amino acids or more from the N terminus were as highly rapamycin-resistant as the gln3Δ strain (Fig. 1, A and B). A common feature of these rapamycin-resistant mutants is that the Gln3p transcriptional activation domain (aa 126–140) is deleted, suggesting that transcriptional activation is critical for the rapamycin-sensitive function of Gln3p. We also tested several Gln3p-MYC9mutants with internal deletions. As expected, deletion of amino acids 102–498 that encompass the transcriptional activation domain causes rapamycin resistance (Fig. 1, A and B). To our surprise, cells carrying Gln3p-MYC9 mutants with internal deletions from amino acids 330–600 and 388–600, which did not affect the transcriptional activation domain, were also highly resistant to rapamycin (Fig. 1, A and B). This observation suggests that there may be one or more other domains critical for the rapamycin-sensitive function within these regions.To further investigate the nature of the rapamycin-sensitive phenotypes, we performed localization studies of the Gln3p-MYC9 mutants by indirect immunofluorescence (IF) microscopy in the absence or presence of rapamycin. The results of these studies are summarized in Fig. 1A. In agreement with previous findings, Gln3p-MYC9 was localized to the cytoplasm in the absence of rapamycin and accumulated in the nucleus within 10 min of rapamycin treatment (Fig. 1, A andC) (8Bertram P.G.

Wente S.R. Zheng X.F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25359-25365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In contrast, all the mutants with N-terminal deletion up to amino acid 387 were nuclear in the absence or presence of rapamycin treatment (Fig. 1, A and C). Further deletion up to amino acid 466 caused Gln3p to remain in the cytoplasm even in the presence of rapamycin (Fig. 1, A andC). In addition, internal deletions of amino acids 102–498, 330–600, and 388–600 also resulted in constitutive cytoplasmic localization of Gln3p (Fig. 1, A and C). These IF results reveal two distinct domains important for Gln3p localization. The constitutive nuclear localization mutants lacking up to 387 amino acids suggest that there are one or more domains within amino acids 1–387, such as the NES, which are inhibitory to Gln3p nuclear localization. On the other hand, the constitutive cytoplasmic mutants indicate that there is a sequence crucial for nuclear localization between amino acids 388 and 466, possibly an NLS (Fig. 1, Aand C). The lack of nuclear localization of these mutants in the presence of rapamycin is consistent with the idea that nuclear localization and transcriptional activation are necessary for the rapamycin-sensitive function of Gln3p (Fig. 1, A andC).We further sought to identify the Gln3p NLS and NES sequences. Upon scanning the amino acid sequence of Gln3p by the PSORT sequence analysis program, we found one motif (336LHGTMRPLSL345) characteristic of the canonical leucine-rich nuclear export signal (Fig. 2A) (28Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar, 29Neville M. Stutz F. Lee L. Davis L.I. Rosbash M. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 767-775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). The fact that Gln3p nuclear export is dependent on the classic nuclear export pathway involving Crm1p (11Carvalho J. Bertram P.G. Wente S.R. Zheng X.F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25359-25365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) suggests that this motif is a likely NES. To confirm this, we deleted this motif and tested for its effect on Gln3p localization. As would be expected for a mutation in the NES, this mutant localized to the nucleus even in the absence of rapamycin (Fig. 2B). Given that Crm1p can interact with the classic leucine-rich NES sequences (28Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar, 29Neville M. Stutz F. Lee L. Davis L.I. Rosbash M. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 767-775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), we investigated the interaction between Crm1p and Gln3p in the presence or absence of the putative NES sequence. By the yeast two-hybrid interaction assay, we found that the Gal4p activation domain (AD)-Crm1p fusion protein interacted with the Gal4p DNA-binding domain (BD)-Gln3p fusion protein (Fig.2C). In contrast, Gal4p AD-Crm1p failed to interact with the Gal4p AD-Gln3p fusion protein missing the putative NES (Fig.2D). These data suggest that the leucine-rich motif is most likely the NES sequence for Gln3p.Figure 2Gln3p contains a classic nuclear export signal (NES) sequence at amino acids 336–345 essential for Gln3p export and interaction with the export factor Crm1p.A, sequence comparison between the NES consensus and the leucine-rich motif in Gln3p. Underlined amino acids are consensus residues defining the classic NES signature. B, the putative NES is essential for Gln3p nuclear export. Yeast cells expressing either wild type Gln3p-MYC9 protein or mutant Gln3p-MYC9 protein with an internal deletion of amino acids 336–345 were treated without or with rapamycin (200 nm, 10 min) (−/+Rap). The localization of Gln3p-MYC9was examined by IF with mAb 9E10. Yeast nuclei were stained with DAPI.C, Gln3p interacts with Crm1p in the yeast two-hybrid assay.

The interaction between SV40 large T antigen (LgT) and p53 was used as a positive control. D, the putative Gln3p NES is necessary for Gln3p interaction with Crm1p.

Raikhel N.V. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 155-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). No bipartite NLS motifs were found. Deletion of NLS1 alone was sufficient to inhibit Gln3p nuclear localization in the presence of rapamycin (Fig. 3,B and C). Deletion of NLS1 in combination with other sequences as shown in Figs. 1A and 3B also resulted in constitutive cytoplasmic localization (Figs. 1A,3B, and 3C). In contrast, deletion of NLS2 has no effect on Gln3p localization in the absence or presence of rapamycin (Fig. 3, B and C). In corroboration with the IF analysis, the NLS1-deletion mutants were rapamycin-resistant, whereas the deletions only encompassing NLS2 were still sensitive like wild type (Fig. 3, B and D). There is also a K/R-rich region at amino acids 351–361 (KKRISKKRAK) that has been suggested as an NLS for Gln3p (31Kulkarni A.A. Abul-Hamd A.T. Rai R. El Berry H. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32136-32144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Despite its K/R-rich sequence, it does not follow the NLS consensus sequences (Fig. 3A). Moreover, deletion of this sequence had no effect on Gln3p localization in the absence and presence of rapamycin, indicating that it is dispensable for the TOR-regulated Gln3p localization (Fig. 3, B andC). Nonetheless, deletion of the K/R-rich region of Gln3p was rapamycin-resistant (Fig. 3, B and D). Therefore, it is still important for the rapamycin-sensitive function.Figure 3Gln3p contains a classic nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequence at amino acids 388–394 essential for Gln3p nuclear localization.A, sequence comparison between the NLS consensus and the K/R-rich motifs in Gln3p reveal two putative NLS signals (NLS1 and NLS2).

Cultures of yeast expressing different Gln3p-MYC9 proteins were serially diluted (10-fold) and spotted onto SC medium minus leucine in the absence or presence of rapamycin (10 nm).

Bertram P.G. Wente S.R. Zheng X.F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25359-25365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To further study the relevance of NLS1, we used the yeast two-hybrid system to determine the interaction between Srp1p and Gln3p in the presence or absence of NLS1. We found that Gal4p AD-Srp1p interacted with Gal4p BD-Gln3p but not the Gal4p BD-Gln3p fusion protein lacking NLS1 (Fig.4A). In addition to thesrp1 mutation, a temperature-sensitive mutation inCSE1, which encodes for the export receptor of Srp1p, also inhibited Gln3p nuclear import in the presence of rapamycin (11Carvalho J. Bertram P.G. Wente S.R. Zheng X.F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25359-25365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Although the cse1 mutation is most likely to influence Gln3p nuclear localization indirectly by blocking Srp1p export, it is possible that Cse1p acts as a Gln3p importing factor. However, Gal4p AD-Cse1p did not interact with Gal4p BD-Gln3p (Fig. 4B), providing further support to the model that Cse1p is the Srp1p exporter as opposed to an import karyopherin for Gln3p.Figure 4NLS1 is essential for interaction with import factor Srp1p.A, NLS1 is essential for Gln3p interaction with Srp1p. Gal4p AD-Srp1p specifically interacts with Gal4p BD-Gln3p-(141–731) but not with Gal4p BD-Gln3p-(141–731) without NLS1. The yeast two-hybrid reporter strain (PJ69-4a) expressing different BD and AD fusion proteins was assayed for growth on an adenine dropout plate or a histidine dropout plate containing 3-AT (3 mm). B, Gln3p does not interact with Cse1p, the nuclear export receptor for Srp1p. Gal4p AD-Cse1p does not interact with Gal4p BD-Gln3p-(141–731) or with Gal4p BD-Gln3p-(141–731) without NLS1.

Because these sequences do not contain the NES, the results suggest that there is another negative element for Gln3p nuclear localization within amino acids 1–316. One possibility is the Ure2p-binding domain (BD). To test this possibility, we performed protein-protein interaction studies between Gln3p and Ure2p. Yeast cell extracts containing different Gln3p-MYC9proteins were incubated with bacterially produced GST or GST-Ure2p bound on glutathione-agarose beads. Gln3p-MYC9 specifically bound to GST-Ure2p, but not to GST alone, confirming a previous observation (Fig. 5A) (8Bertram P.G. Choi J. Carvalho J. Ai W.D. Zeng C.B. Chan T.F. Zheng X.F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35727-35733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In addition, GST-Ure2p bound to deletions of Gln3p-MYC9lacking the NES, the K/R-rich motif, and a protein missing both the NES and K/R-rich motifs (Fig. 5A), indicating that none of these regions are necessary for Ure2p binding. In contrast, deletion of amino acids 1–200 completely abolished the ability of Gln3p to bind to GST-Ure2p, as did further deletions from the N terminus (Fig.5A). Deletion of N-terminal amino acids 1–101 resulted in reduced interaction between GST-Ure2p and Gln3p-MYC9 (Fig.5A). Therefore, amino acids 102–200 appear to be critical for the Gln3p-Ure2p interaction, possibly directly involved in binding to Ure2p. The first 101 amino acids may also be needed for a stable Ure2p-Gln3p interaction, because Gln3p(Δ1–101)-MYC9 binds weakly to Ure2p, which could explain why the 1–101 deletion of Gln3p-MYC9 is localized to the nucleus even in the absence of rapamycin treatment (Fig. 1,A and C).Figure 5Identification of a Ure2p-binding domain at the N terminus of Gln3p.A, Gln3p binds Ure2pin vitro via an N-terminal Ure2p-binding domain.

https://openalex.org/W2150936201,"Aqueous humor is a clear fluid, primarily a blood filtrate, which circulates through the anterior chamber of the eye and bathes the cornea. We explored the possibility that components in the aqueous humor play a direct part in maintaining the avascular environment of the cornea. We report here that heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) was found in bovine aqueous humor and that it directly inhibits binding of basic fibroblast growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor to cell-surface heparan sulfate. We demonstrate that this holds true for all heparin binding proteins tested but not for epidermal growth factor, which does not bind heparin. Furthermore, we show, with mathematical modeling, that the concentration of HSPG in aqueous humor (approximately 4 microg/ml), when combined with the clearance of aqueous humor from the eye due to circulation, is sufficient to block the binding of heparin binding growth factors to corneal endothelium. This mechanism suggests a physiological process to control bioavailability of angiogenic growth factors in the cornea."

Using K562 cells, we have studied valproic acid-induced transcription from the human Gαi2 gene promoter, which lacks AP-1-binding motifs. We find that valproic acid-induced expression of Gαi2 is inhibited by mithramycin A, a compound that interferes with Sp1 binding to GC boxes in DNA. Three Sp1-binding sequences, located at +68/+75, −50/−36, and −92/−85 in the promoter, accounted for about 60% of this transcriptional effect, as judged by transient transfection assays. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated that these sites bind members of the Sp family of transcription factors. Binding to DNA was inhibited by mithramycin A and was greater in nuclear extracts from cells treated with valproic acid than in control cells. Okadaic acid, calyculin A, and fostriecin, which are potent inhibitors of protein phosphatase, suppressed the transcriptional response to valproic acid. This inhibitory effect was not observed when promoter constructs containing mutations in the referenced Sp1-binding sites were used for transfections. In nuclear extracts from cells cultured in the presence of these inhibitors, the binding of Sp1/Sp3 to DNA probes was much less than in control cells. Alkaline phosphatase treatment of nuclear extracts resulted in enhanced binding of Sp proteins to the DNA probes. These results are consistent with the idea that dephosphorylating conditions enhanced Sp binding to the DNA probes as well as Sp-mediated transcription induced by valproic acid.

Valproic acid is a new addition to this list and was shown recently to inhibit histone deacetylase inXenopus and human embryonic kidney (293T) cells (9Phiel C.J. Zhang F. Huang E.Y. Guenther M.G.

Taken together with the studies of Doetzlhofer et al. (22Doetzlhofer A. Rotheneder H. Lagger G. Koranda M. Kurtev V. Brosch G. Wintersberger E. Seiser C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5504-5511Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) that show that inhibition of HDAC by HDAC inhibitors releases an inhibitory constraint on Sp1, making it possible for this transcription factor to associate with other accessory proteins to effect transcription, our present study provides an important dimension to further understanding of mechanisms underlying valproic acid-induced gene transcription.Valproic acid-induced transcription demonstrated in this study was sensitive to three powerful inhibitors of PP1 and PP2A (i.e.okadaic acid, calyculin A, and fostriecin), indicating that it requires the action of protein phosphatase. These chemical inhibitor studies, however, do not precisely pinpoint which protein phosphatase may be involved. That the transcriptional action of Sp1 can be influenced by its phosphorylation state has been amply demonstrated (31Daniel S. Zhang S. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Kim K.-H. J. Biol.

Kahn-Perlès B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9598-9605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated, in interleukin-2-treated T lymphoma cell line Kit225, that PP2A but not PP1 dephosphorylates Sp1, resulting in increased binding of Sp1 to DNA as well as up-regulation of its transcriptional activity with respect to the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 long terminal repeat promoter as well as a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene under the control of six tandem Sp1-binding sites from SV40 early promoter (SV40-tkCAT). Also, Li et al. (54Li J. Park S.W. Loh H.H. Wei L.-N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39967-39972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) recently showed in studies with mouse embryonal carcinoma P19 cells that retinoic acid-induced transcription from the mouse κ-opioid receptor gene promoter is mediated by increased binding of dephosphorylated Sp1 to GC box elements in that promoter. We can infer from their studies and from our protein phosphatase experiments (Figs. Figure 7, Figure 8, Figure 9) that dephosphorylated Sp1/Sp3 mediated valproic acid-induced transcription from the Gαi2 gene promoter observed in our present study. Besides Sp1, not much is known about post-translational modification(s) that might influence the transcriptional activity of Sp family of transcription factors. Our present work suggests that, like Sp1, phosphorylation state of Sp3 might influence its DNA binding/transcriptional activity. Interestingly, two research groups (55Ross S. Best J.L. Zon L.I. Gill G. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 831-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 56Sapetschnig A. Rischitor G. Braun H. Doll A. Schergaut M. Melchior F. Suske G.

We can infer from their studies and from our protein phosphatase experiments (Figs. Figure 7, Figure 8, Figure 9) that dephosphorylated Sp1/Sp3 mediated valproic acid-induced transcription from the Gαi2 gene promoter observed in our present study. Besides Sp1, not much is known about post-translational modification(s) that might influence the transcriptional activity of Sp family of transcription factors. Our present work suggests that, like Sp1, phosphorylation state of Sp3 might influence its DNA binding/transcriptional activity. Interestingly, two research groups (55Ross S. Best J.L. Zon L.I.

A recent study involving induction of differentiation in F9 embryocarcinoma cells has suggested that valproic acid induces the expression of peroxisome proliferating activating receptor δ and has associated this induction with the occurrence of valproic acid-induced teratogenicity (45Werling U.

However, it is unclear whether the gene expression-inducing effect of valproic acid can be attributed solely to its activation of AP-1 binding to DNA. In fact, Phiel et al.(9Phiel C.J. Zhang F.

In the present study, we have used the human Gαi2 gene promoter, which does not contain AP-1 sequence motifs (15Weinstein L.S. Spiegel A.M. Carter A.D.

Valproic acid-induced transcription was also substantially depressed when three Sp1-binding sequences in the human Gαi2 gene promoter were mutated. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated that these sequences bind not only Sp1 but also Sp2 and Sp3, three closely related members of the Sp family of transcription factors. Together with the results of our reporter gene assays, these data support the conclusion that one or more members of the Sp family of transcription factors is involved in the transcriptional effect of valproic acid on the human Gαi2gene promoter. This study provides a substantially different perspective from reports (8Yuan P.-X. Huang L.-D. Jiang Y.-M. Gutkind J.S. Manji H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31674-31683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 13Yuan P. Chen G. Manji H.K. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 2299-2309Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) that defined the AP-1 response element as the modality by which valproic acid induces gene expression. The finding that mutations at these critical Sp1 sites from the Gαi2 gene promoter did not completely suppress transcription in our cellular transfection system suggests that other transcription factor(s) besides Sp family members may also be involved in the demonstrated transcriptional effect of valproic acid.

https://openalex.org/W2106133325,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) involves the progressive degeneration of motor neurons in the spinal cord and motor cortex. It has been shown that 15-20% of patients with familial ALS (FALS) have defects in the Sod1 gene that encodes Cu, Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD). To elucidate the pathological role of mutated Cu, Zn-SODs in FALS, the susceptibility of mutants to glycation was examined. Mutated Cu, Zn-SODs (G37R, G93A, and I113T) related to FALS and wild type were produced in a baculovirus/insect cell expression system. Glycated and nonglycated proteins were separated on a boronate column, and the nonglycated fraction was then incubated with glucose. The mutated Cu, Zn-SODs were found to be highly susceptible to glycation compared with the wild-type enzyme as estimated by Western blot analysis using an anti-hexitol lysine antibody. The mutated Cu, Zn-SOD incubated with glucose generated higher levels of hydrogen peroxide than the wild-type enzyme. Mutated Cu, Zn-SODs were also shown to be highly susceptible to fructation, and the fructated mutant also produced higher levels of hydrogen peroxide than the wild type. These results suggest that high susceptibility of mutated Cu, Zn-SODs to glycation could be the origin of the oxidative stress associated with neuronal dysfunction in FALS."

In this study, we have identified three Skn-1 isoforms, which encode proteins with various N termini, generated by alternative promoter usage. These isotypes showed distinct expression patterns in various skin samples, internal squamous epithelia, and cultured human keratinocytes. Skn-1a and Skn-1d1 bound the<i>SPRR2A</i> octamer site with comparable affinity and functioned as transcriptional activators. Skn-1d2 did not affect<i>SPRR2A</i> expression. Skn-1a, the largest protein, functionally cooperated with Ese-1/Elf-3, an epithelial-specific transcription factor, previously implicated in <i>SPRR2A</i>induction. This cooperativity, which depended on an N-terminal pointed-like domain in Skn-1a, was not found for Skn-1d1. Actually, Skn-1d1 counteracted the cooperativity between Skn-1a and Ese-1. Apparently, the human <i>Skn-1</i> locus encodes multifunctional protein isotypes, subjected to biochemical cross-talk, which are likely to play a major role in the fine-tuning of keratinocyte terminal differentiation."

The phosphorylation of the GPCR promotes binding of β-arrestin, which is required for dynamin II-dependent endocytosis of the receptor-signal complex and subsequent activation of p42/p44 MAPK (13Daaka Y.

Thus, the expression of dominant-inhibitory β-arrestin I or dynamin II mutants impairs insulin-like growth factor-1-, β-adrenergic-, and lysophosphatidic acid-dependent activation of p42/p44 MAPK (14Ahn S.

Science. 1996; 271: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). In the presence of these inhibitory mutants, the p42/p44 MAPK signaling cascade proceeds only as far as Raf activation (16Ferguson S.S.G. Downey III, W.E. Colapietro A.-M. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. Science. 1996; 271: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). β-Arrestin is a clathrin adaptor that binds certain receptor complexes and targets them to clathrin-coated pits, whereas dynamin II is a GTPase involved in the “pinching off” of clathrin-coated endocytic vesicles containing the receptor-signal complex (17Clague M.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 271-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The hydrolysis of GTP by dynamin II is believed to be catalytic for pinching off of endocytic vesicles and subsequent relocalization of receptor signal complexes with cytoplasmic MEK-1 and p42/p44 MAPK. The phototransduction cascade involving rhodopsin (GPCR), GRK, β-arrestin, and RGS9Gβ5 (18Stryer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10711-10714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) bears many similarities with signaling by growth factors and G-protein-coupled receptors in other mammalian cell systems. The phototransduction cascade involves cGMP phosphodiesterases that are expressed in rod and cone photoreceptors (termed PDE6) as tetrameric proteins composed of two catalytic subunits and two γ subunits (PDEγ). PDEγ inhibits cGMP hydrolysis at the catalytic sites. The two types of photoreceptor cells, rod and cone, express different isoforms of PDEγ. These proteins differ in their extreme N-terminal regions, whereas the central polycationic and C-terminal domains that are involved in the interaction with both PDE6 and transducin are almost identical. We have found that PDEγ has a wider role in mammalian cell biology (19Lochhead A. Nekrasova E. Arshavsky V.Y. Pyne N.J. J. Biol.

Indeed, we have reported that rod PDEγ is expressed in lung, kidney, testes, liver, heart, airway, and pulmonary smooth muscle and HEK 293 cells and is absent from these tissues in rod PDEγ knockout mice. We have also identified a novel role for PDEγ in regulating the EGF- and thrombin-dependent activation of the p42/p44 MAPK pathway in HEK 293 cells (21Wan K.-F. Sambi B. Frame M. Tate R.J. Pyne N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37802-37808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We also found that GRK2 is required for the stimulatory effect of rod PDEγ on both the EGF- and thrombin-dependent activation of p42/p44 MAPK. Indeed, rod and cone PDEγ are substrates for phosphorylation by GRK2. Moreover, a GRK2 phosphorylation-resistant (Thr-62 changed to Ala) rod PDEγ mutant failed to increase the EGF- or thrombin-dependent activation of p42/p44 MAPK, and in fact functioned as a dominant negative. We also presented evidence to show that thrombin stimulates the formation of a complex between rod PDEγ and dynamin II (21Wan K.-F. Sambi B. Frame M. Tate R.J. Pyne N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37802-37808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is significant because it is well established that GTP hydrolysis by dynamin II promotes endocytosis of vesicles containing receptor signal complexes that subsequently relocalize with and activate cytoplasmic p42/p44 MAPK. Taken together, the data are consistent with the phosphorylation of Thr-62 in rod PDEγ by GRK2 being essential for interaction with dynamin II. In this paper, we have further explored the dynamic of the interaction between PDEγ and GRK2. We show for the first time that PDEγ is a functional linker/regulator of both c-Src and GRK2. We also show that a GRK2 phosphorylation-resistant PDEγ mutant (Thr-62 PDEγ mutant) is less effective than the wild type protein in binding GRK2 in response to EGF. The mutant appears to function as an endogenous dominant negative by acting as a sink for c-Src. We also provide the first evidence for a negative feedback mechanism involving p42/p44 MAPK that regulates PDEγ and appears to limit the duration of p42/p44 MAPK activation in response to EGF.

HEK 293 cells were maintained in minimal essential medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum. These cells were placed in minimal essential medium for 24 h before experimentation. ASM cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum and 10% donor horse serum. These cells were placed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.1% (v/v) fetal calf serum for 24 h before experimentation. HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected with vector or rod PDEγ or Thr-62 rod PDEγ mutant pcDNA-6xHis plasmid constructs or pRK5-GRK2 plasmid constructs. Cells at 90% confluence were placed in minimal essential medium containing 2% (v/v) fetal calf serum and transfected with 2 μg of plasmid construct following complex formation with LipofectAMINETM 2000, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cDNA-containing media were then removed following incubation for 24 h at 37 °C, and the cells were incubated for a further 24 h in serum-free medium prior to addition of epidermal growth factor. ASM cells were transiently transfected with mouse lung rod (wild type and Thr-22 mutant) PDEγ pcDNA-3.1 plasmid constructs in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 2% (v/v) fetal calf serum for 24 h before experimentation. To generate the Thr-62 (replaced with Ala) mutant, a PCR was performed using mouse lung rod PDEγ pcDNA-3.1 plasmid construct with forward (5′-GGA AGG CCT GGG G(G)C AGA TAT CAC CGT CAT C-3′) and reverse primers (5′-GAT GAC GGT GAT ATC TG(C) CCC CAG GCC TTC C-3′) (Invitrogen). To generate the Thr-22 (replaced with Ala) mutant, a PCR was performed using mouse lung rod PDEγ pcDNA-3.1 plasmid construct with forward (5′-GGA GGA CCA GTC GCC CCC AGG AAA G-3′) and reverse primers (5′-C TTT CCT GGG GGC GAC TGG TCC TCC-3′) (Invitrogen). Both of these sets of primers were used in a QuikChange (Stratagene) PCR. The PCR conditions were per the QuikChange manual with the following changes: 1 cycle at 95 °C for 30 s followed by 12 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for 11 min. The reaction was digested withDpnI, and a 1-μl aliquot was transformed into Top10 strainEscherichia coli (Invitrogen). Plasmid preparations were obtained from the resultant colonies and screened for the correct mutation by sequencing. The mutated insert was subcloned from pcDNA-3.1 by digesting with BamHI and HindIII and was also inserted in-frame into pTrcHis-B (Invitrogen). Stimulations of HEK 293 cells were carried out at 37 °C in serum-free medium. After stimulation, medium was removed from the monolayer cell and washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 1 ml of buffer containing 1× phosphate-buffered saline, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm PMSF, leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin (all protease inhibitors were at 10 μg/ml). The lysates were passed through the 21-gauge needle to shear the DNA. The lysates were then incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. The cell lysate supernatant was then harvested by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The open reading frame of mouse lung rod PDEγ was subcloned into an expression vector pTrcHis (Invitrogen). The vector was transformed into TOP10F′E. coli strain. The E. coli was grown in 2 ml of Luria Broth (LB) containing 10% (w/v) tryptone, 5% (w/v) yeast extract, and 10% (w/v) NaCl supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C overnight. The overnight E. coli culture was then diluted 50-fold with 100 ml of LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and grown for an additional 2.5 h, until theA600 of the culture was 0.6–0.8. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside was then added to a final concentration of 1 mm for induction of the culture at 30 °C. After a suitable period of induction (3 h), the cells were harvested by centrifugation (A-18C rotor Centrikon T-42K, 15 min at 7,400 rpm at 4 °C) and resuspended in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.8. Each sample was then lysed by 3 times ultrasonication followed by 3 times freeze-thaw cycles in lysis buffer. All buffers above contained protease inhibitors (20 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 mmbenzamidine, and 0.1 mm PMSF) to inhibit proteolytic reaction in the sample. The lysed cells were then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm/10 min at 4 °C (Sigma laboratory centrifuge IK15) to remove the insoluble cell debris. The supernatant was stored at −70 °C. Ni-NTA magnetic agarose beads (Qiagen) were resuspended by vortexing for 2 s. 500 μl of the recombinant His6-tagged rod PDEγ was immediately added to 50 μl of the 5% (w/v) Ni-NTA magnetic agarose beads suspension. The suspension was incubated on an end-over-end shaker for 1 h at 4 °C. This was to allow efficient binding of the His-tagged rod PDEγ to the Ni-NTA magnetic agarose beads. After 1 h, the microcentrifuge tubes containing the complexes were placed on a 12-tube magnetic separator for 1 min, and the supernatant was removed with a pipette. The magnetic beads-His-tagged rod PDEγ complexes were washed with wash buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, and 20 mm imidazole, pH 8.0) for 3 times at 4 °C, and the wash buffer was removed by placing the microcentrifuge tubes on the magnetic separator for 1 min. The HEK 293 cell lysate supernatant was then added to the magnetic beads. The suspension was incubated on an end-over-end shaker for 1 h at 4 °C. After 1 h, the complexes were washed with wash buffer once, and the wash buffer was removed as described above. The potential interaction proteins with His-tagged rod PDEγ were eluted with elution buffer containing 50 mmNaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, pH 8.0, and collected for detection by SDS-PAGE/Western blot. The medium was removed, and cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer ((1 ml) containing 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1% (w/v) deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 20 mmTris-HCl, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.2 mmPMSF, leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin (all protease inhibitors were at 10 μg/ml, pH 8.0)) for immunoprecipitation. The cells were harvested and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. The concentration of cell lysate supernatant was determined and equalized by performing Bradford colorimetric assay (0.5–1 mg/ml). Cell lysate supernatant was electrophoresed in polyacrylamide gel as positive control. For immunoprecipitation assay, cell lysate supernatant (500 μl) was taken for immunoprecipitation with specific antibodies (2 μg of antibodies and 100 μl of 1:1 protein A-Sepharose CL4B; 1:1 indicates equal part of protein A-Sepharose and immunoprecipitation buffer). After agitation for 2 h at 4 °C, the immune complex was collected by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 15 s at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed twice with ice-cold buffer A (containing 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40) and once in buffer A without Nonidet P-40. The immunoprecipitates were resuspended in boiling sample buffer containing 62 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 1.25% (w/v) SDS, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 3.75% (v/v) mercaptoethanol, and 0.05% (w/v) bromphenol blue. The samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Western blotting for phosphorylated p42/p44 MAPK, c-Src, GRK2, Grb-2, dynamin II, and PDEγ was as described previously (21Wan K.-F. Sambi B. Frame M. Tate R.J. Pyne N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37802-37808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit. The phosphorylated forms of p42/p44 MAPK were detected by Western blotting cell lysates with anti-phospho-p42/p44 MAPK antibody. Anti-p42 MAPK antibody was used to establish equal loading of p42 MAPK in each sample. Quantification was by densitometry. The ability of GRK2 to phosphorylate PDEγ in an EGF-dependent manner prompted us to investigate whether these proteins exist in a complex in HEK 293 cells. In addition, several reports (23Sarnago S. Elorza A. Mayor Jr., F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34411-34416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) have shown that growth factors activate c-Src and GRK2 and that these proteins regulate each other in a bi-directional manner. Moreover, in previous studies (21Wan K.-F. Sambi B. Frame M. Tate R.J. Pyne N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37802-37808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) we reported that the overexpression of GRK2 and/or PDEγ increases the activation of p42/p44 MAPK induced by EGF. Therefore, HEK 293 cells were transfected with PDEγ plasmid constructs and PDEγ, c-Src, and GRK2 immunoprecipitated with specific respective antibodies from lysates of cells treated with and without EGF. We report here that PDEγ and c-Src exist in a pre-formed complex and that stimulation of cells with EGF promotes association of GRK2 with the PDEγ-c-Src complex. This was based upon several lines of evidence. First, Fig.1a shows that recombinant overexpressed PDEγ (14 kDa) and c-Src (60 kDa) are co-immunoprecipitated with GRK2 (85 kDa) from lysates of HEK 293 cells using anti-GRK2 antibodies. The amount of both c-Src and recombinant PDEγ co-immunoprecipitated with GRK2 was increased from cells treated with EGF (fold stimulations in response to EGF: c-Src, 2.74 ± 1.26-fold; PDEγ, 1.75 ± 0.05-fold, n = 3,p < 0.05 versus control). The EGF-dependent increase in the amount of c-Src and PDEγ retrieved in anti-GRK2 immunoprecipitates is entirely to be expected if c-Src and PDEγ are indeed pre-complexed, and EGF stimulation of cells promotes their association with GRK2. The data obtained are therefore entirely compatible with this model. Second, Fig. 1b shows that PDEγ and GRK2 were co-immunoprecipitated with c-Src using anti-c-Src antibodies. The amount of PDEγ co-immunoprecipitated was not increased from cells treated with EGF. In contrast, the amount of GRK2 associated with c-Src was increased from cells treated with EGF (fold stimulations in response to EGF: GRK2, 1.85 ± 0.12-fold, GRK2 plus recombinant overexpressed PDEγ, 1.47 ± 0.21-fold,n = 3, p < 0.05 versuscontrol). In addition, there is a 3.05 ± 0.64-fold increase (n = 2) in the amount of GRK2 associated with c-Src in cells overexpressing PDEγ compared with cells expressing only endogenous PDEγ. The fact that the association of PDEγ with c-Src is not sensitive to EGF stimulation provides additional evidence that these proteins are in a pre-formed complex that is strictly EGF-independent. The increased amount of GRK2 in anti-c-Src immunoprecipitates isolated from cells treated with EGF provides additional evidence that it is the binding of GRK2 to the PDEγ-c-Src complex that is, in fact, EGF-dependent. We also found that Grb-2 (26 kDa) was co-immunoprecipitated with c-Src, indicating association between these proteins. This association was also increased in cells transfected with PDEγ. Third, Fig. 1c shows that c-Src and GRK2 were co-immunoprecipitated with PDEγ from lysates. The amount of c-Src co-immunoprecipitated with PDEγ using anti-PDEγ antibodies was not increased from cells treated with EGF. Again, this is entirely in line with our interpretation that the c-Src-PDEγ complex is pre-formed in an EGF-independent manner. The amount of GRK2 co-immunoprecipitated with PDEγ was increased from cells treated with EGF (fold stimulations in response to EGF: GRK2, 2.01 ± 0.82-fold, n = 3, p < 0.05versus control), again indicating that it is the GRK2 binding step that is EGF-dependent. None of the proteins were co-immunoprecipitated when antibodies were omitted from the immunoprecipitation procedure (data not shown). Only a small fraction of PDEγ is present in the complex with c-Src and GRK2 (see Fig. 1, a and b compared withc). Thus, only a limited increase in the expression of this protein is actually required to bind c-Src and GRK2 in order to support EGF receptor signaling. This is corroborated by previous findings (21Wan K.-F. Sambi B. Frame M. Tate R.J. Pyne N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37802-37808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showing that PDEγ is limiting for EGF receptor signaling to p42/p44 MAPK. The current findings are also compatible with the fact that cells are stimulated with a single agonist that might use only a relatively small fraction of the PDEγ expressed. The fold increases in the EGF-dependent association of GRK2 with the c-Src-PDEγ complex reported here are also in agreement with the potentiation of EGF-stimulated p42/p44 MAPK activation by PDEγ (see Fig.1d). In addition to the recombinant form of the protein, we have also reported previously (21Wan K.-F. Sambi B. Frame M. Tate R.J. Pyne N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37802-37808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that endogenous PDEγ participates in regulating EGF receptor signaling to p42/p44 MAPK. This was supported by data showing that the effect of endogenous PDEγ can be ablated by transfection of cells with PDEγ antisense plasmid construct (21Wan K.-F. Sambi B. Frame M. Tate R.J. Pyne N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37802-37808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Endogenous PDEγ, c-Src, and GRK2 clearly form a complex in cells, as significant amounts of these proteins were isolated in anti-Src immunoprecipitates from vector-transfected cells (Fig. 1b). As with overexpressed recombinant PDEγ, EGF promoted the association of GRK2 with endogenous PDEγ in this complex (Fig. 1b). Our findings are important because they are the first to define a role for PDEγ as a functional linker between GRK2 and c-Src. Thus, PDEγ may function to recruit GRK2 close to c-Src, whereupon there may be the reciprocal activation of each kinase. This functional interaction between PDEγ, GRK2, and c-Src is important because the formation of the complex appears to be required for EGF-dependent activation of p42/p44 MAPK. Thus, overexpression of PDEγ or GRK2 increased EGF-dependent activation of p42/p44 MAPK (Fig.1d, fold stimulations in response to EGF versusvector-transfected cells: rod PDEγ, 1.7 ± 0.1; GRK2, 1.8 ± 0.2, n = 3, p < 0.05versus vector-transfected cells), whereas pretreatment of cells with the c-Src inhibitor, PP2, ablated EGF-dependent activation of p42/p44 MAPK (Fig. 1e). We have also obtained additional evidence for a mechanistic link between c-Src-PDEγ and p42/p44 MAPK. We report here that the p42/p44 MAPK activated in response to EGF associates with the c-Src-PDEγ complex. Thus, phosphorylated p42/p44 MAPK is present in anti-PDEγ immunoprecipitates with PDEγ, c-Src, and GRK2 from vector- and PDEγ-transfected cells treated with EGF but not from control cells (Fig. 1f). These data strongly suggest that the inhibition of the pool of PDEγ associated c-Src by PP2 is directly responsible for the attenuation of the EGF-dependent activation of p42/p44 MAPK by this compound. The results therefore further highlight the physiological significance of the PDEγ-c-Src complex in regulating this kinase pathway. These findings also suggest that the PDEγ-c-Src-GRK2 complex might undergo endocytosis and relocalization with components of the p42/p44 MAPK pathway. In previous studies we reported that GRK2 phosphorylates PDEγ on Thr-62. Thus, mutagenesis of the Thr-62 (to Ala) produces a protein whose phosphorylation by GRK2 is severely impeded (21Wan K.-F. Sambi B. Frame M. Tate R.J. Pyne N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37802-37808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of the Thr-62 in PDEγ has no impact on the folding of this protein, which exists in solution as a polypeptide without tertiary structure. In contrast with wild type PDEγ, the Thr-62 mutant cannot support EGF-dependent activation of p42/p44 MAPK and, indeed, functions as a dominant negative to block the involvement of endogenous PDEγ in regulating p42/p44 MAPK signaling (Fig.2a, fold stimulations of p42/p44 MAPK in response to EGF versus vector-transfected cells: rod PDEγ, 1.6 ± 0.34; Thr-62 PDEγ, 0.54 ± 0.02-fold, n = 3, p < 0.05versus vector-transfected cells). We now show that the mutant PDEγ is not an efficient binding partner of GRK2 in cells stimulated with EGF when compared with wild type PDEγ (Fig.2b). Consistent with this, we found that the amount of GRK2 associated with c-Src was reduced by 52 ± 30% (n = 3, p < 0.05 versusvector transfected cells) in EGF-stimulated cells overexpressing Thr-62 mutant PDEγ compared with vector-transfected cells. This finding indicates that the mutant might prevent GRK2 binding to endogenous PDEγ (Fig. 2b). How can this be achieved? One possibility is that the Thr-62 mutant might act as a sink for c-Src, thereby preventing interaction of c-Src with GRK2 via endogenous PDEγ. Consistent with this possibility is our finding that the Thr-62 mutant was still capable of binding c-Src. Thus, the amount of wild type or Thr-62 mutant PDEγ co-immunoprecipitated with c-Src was similar (Fig.2b). Mutation of Thr-62 in PDEγ also reduced the interaction between the c-Src and Grb-2 (Fig. 2b). We have also detected transcript for a short cone PDEγ isoform, which has a 41-bp deletion (corresponding to exon 3) resulting in a frame change (22Tate R.J. Arshavsky V.Y. Pyne N.J. Genomics. 2002; 79: 582-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). This deletion produces a new “in-frame” stop codon resulting in an early termination to produce a truncated protein (short cone PDEγ) that lacks Thr-62. This protein is predicted to have an identical N-terminal and polycationic mid-region but a different C-terminal domain compared with the larger version of cone PDEγ. We have therefore investigated the effect of the truncated recombinant cone PDEγ on p42/p44 MAPK signaling. Overexpression of the truncated cone PDEγ reduced the EGF-dependent activation of p42/p44 MAPK (Fig. 3, upper panel, fold stimulations of p42/p44 MAPK in response to EGFversus vector-transfected cells: rod PDEγ, 1.6 ± 0.34; short cone PDEγ; 0.59 ± 0.27; rod PDEγ plus short cone PDEγ; 1.15 ± 0.06, n = 3–6, p< 0.05 for rod PDEγ plus short cone PDEγ-transfectedversus rod PDEγ-transfected cells). The increase in thrombin-dependent activation of p42/p44 MAPK induced by either rod or large cone PDEγ was also reduced in cells overexpressing the truncated cone PDEγ (Fig. 3, lower panel, fold stimulations of p42/p44 MAPK in response to thrombinversus vector-transfected cells: rod PDEγ, 2.3 ± 0.2; cone PDEγ, 2.05 ± 0.18; short cone PDEγ, 0.77 ± 0.15; short cone PDEγ plus rod PDEγ, 0.95 ± 0.03; short cone PDEγ plus cone PDEγ, 0.84 ± 0.12, n = 3–6,p < 0.05 for rod or cone PDEγ plus short cone PDEγ-transfected versus rod or cone PDEγ-transfected cells). Thus, the truncated cone PDEγ may also act as an endogenous dominant negative modulator of EGF- and thrombin-dependent stimulation of the p42/p44 MAPK pathway. One of the structural determinants in PDEγ that may be important for association with c-Src is an SH3-binding site. PDEγ contains an SH3 consensus binding site20PVTPRKGPP28, which is identical with the corresponding region in the cone isoform with the exception that valine at amino acid position 21 is replaced by threonine. This site may therefore interact with an SH3 domain in c-Src. In previous studies (21Wan K.-F. Sambi B. Frame M. Tate R.J. Pyne N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37802-37808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) we reported that thrombin also promotes the association of PDEγ with dynamin II. This might also involve interaction of dynamin II SH3-binding site via an intermediate double SH3 domain containing protein (e.g. Grb-2) with20PVTPRKGPP28 in PDEγ. Thus, PDEγ might bind several proteins via SH3 interaction. Indeed, along with c-Src and GRK2, dynamin II is involved in endocytic processes that are required for certain GPCR/growth factor-dependent activations of p42/p44 MAPK (4Luttrell L. Van Biesen T.

It is therefore possible that PDEγ might form either dimers or tetramers, thereby increasing the number of SH3 domain binding sites from 1 to 4. Indeed, it is well established that PDEγ forms dimers via hydrophobic interaction, and indeed, two molecules of PDEγ bind to PDE6 in rod photoreceptors (18Stryer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10711-10714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To assess this possibility, we immobilized His-tagged PDEγ on a nickel-agarose matrix in order to capture endogenous PDEγ-c-Src-Grk2 complexes present in lysates from HEK 293 cells. Fig.4a shows that GRK2 (85 kDa), c-Src (60 kDa), dynamin II (112 kDa), and Grb-2 (26 kDa) in lysates from control cells were all trapped by the His-tagged PDEγ-agarose matrix and eluted with imidazole. The amount of each of these proteins binding to the His-tagged PDEγ-agarose matrix was increased from lysates of cells treated with EGF (fold stimulations in response to EGFversus control cells: GRK2, 1.73 ± 0.51-fold; dynamin II, 1.53 ± 0.18-fold; Grb-2, 1.47 ± 0.14-fold; c-Src, 1.45 ± 0.11-fold, n = 3, p < 0.05 for all versus control). PDEγ was also eluted with imidazole from the nickel matrix (Fig. 4b). The fold increases in the binding of the various proteins are all similar. This is entirely consistent with the possibility that EGF treatment of cells might promote the binding of the entire complex of proteins to PDEγ immobilized on the nickel matrix. Taken together, these findings suggest that EGF may increase the affinity of PDEγ for PDEγ- protein complexes. We conclude that the stimulation of cells with EGF might induce three events. First, EGF promotes association of GRK2 with the c-Src-PDEγ complex. Second, EGF promotes GRK2-catalyzed phosphorylation of PDEγ; and third, the growth factor may increase the affinity of PDEγ for PDEγ. This may promote formation of a dimeric or tetrameric PDEγ platform upon which other proteins involved in endocytic signaling to p42/p44 MAPK, such as dynamin II, can associate. The20PVTPRKGPP28 site in rod PDEγ also contains a consensus site for phosphorylation by p42/p44 MAPK (20PVTP23). Indeed, we found that this site was phosphorylated by p42/p44 MAPK. Paglia and colleagues (24Paglia M.J. Mou H. Cote R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5017-5023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) have formerly reported stoichiometric phosphorylation of PDEγ by p42 MAPK. Therefore, we have mutated Thr-22 to establish its effect on PDEγ-mediated regulation of p42/p44 MAPK. For this purpose we used cultured airway smooth muscle cells. These cells contain abundant amounts of PDEγ (18Stryer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10711-10714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), such that the protein is saturating for EGF-stimulated p42/p44 MAPK activation (data not shown). Transfection of these cells with Thr-22 mutant PDEγ-pcDNA3.1 plasmid construct led to a prolonged activation of p42/p44 MAPK by EGF compared with vector (H)-transfected cells (Fig.5). These data are compatible with the possibility that p42/p44 MAPK can phosphorylate PDEγ at Thr-22 to exert the feedback inhibition of PDEγ-c-Src/GRK2 activity, thereby limiting the duration of p42/p44 MAPK activation in response to EGF. Presumably, mutagenesis of Thr-22 to Ala does not in itself disrupt interaction between PDEγ, c-Src, and GRK2, as this mutant is still capable of supporting activation of p42/p44 MAPK in response to EGF. Indeed, the mutant is more efficient compared with the endogenous wild type PDEγ. In this case, the Thr-22 mutant presumably replaces endogenous wild type PDEγ in the signaling pathway regulating p42/p44 MAPK. To conclude, these findings highlight an important role for PDEγ in transducing signals from GRK2/c-Src to p42/p44 MAPK. They also demonstrate that PDEγ functions as an important intermediate regulating this mitogenic signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1988965126,"We recently reported that Arachis hypogaea serine/threonine/tyrosine (STY) protein kinase is developmentally regulated and is induced by abiotic stresses (Rudrabhatla, P., and Rajasekharan, R. (2002) Plant Physiol. 130, 380–390). Other than MAPKs, the site of tyrosine phosphorylation has not been documented for any plant kinases. To study the role of tyrosines in the phosphorylation of STY protein kinase, four conserved tyrosine residues were sequentially substituted with phenylalanine and expressed as histidine fusion proteins. Mass spectrometry experiments showed that STY protein kinase autophosphorylated within the predicted kinase ATP-binding motif, activation loop, and an additional site in the C terminus. The protein kinase activity was abolished by substitution of Tyr 297 with Phe in the activation loop between subdomains VII and VIII. In addition, replacing Tyr 148 in the ATP-binding motif and Tyr 317 in the C-terminal domain with Phe not only obliterated the ability of the STY protein kinase protein to be phosphorylated, but also inhibited histone phosphorylation, suggesting that STY protein kinase is phosphorylated at multiple sites. Replacing Tyr 213 in the Thr-Glu-Tyr sequence motif with Phe resulted in a 4-fold increase in autophosphorylation and 2.8-fold increase in substrate phosphorylation activities. Mutants Y148F, Y297F, and Y317F displayed dramatically lower phosphorylation efficiency ( k cat / K m ) with ATP and histone, whereas mutant Y213F showed increased phosphorylation. Our results suggest that autophosphorylation of Tyr 148 , Tyr 213 , Tyr 297 , and Tyr 317 is important for the regulation of STY protein kinase activity. Our study reveals the first example of Thr-Glu-Tyr domain-mediated autoinhibition of kinases."

Wandinger-Ness A. Roitbak T. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 374-381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Oftentimes a single point mutation or a deletion in the coding region of a gene is the underlying cause for the generation of the folding mutant. The mechanisms of folding and vesicular transport of proteins implicate structural elements in the protein itself and cellular protein components interacting with these structures (2Hammond C. Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). A complex cascade of association, dissociation, and reassociation dominates the life cycle of many proteins that transiently reside in the ER1 prior to their exit and further trafficking to their final destination at the cell surface, the Golgi apparatus, or the lysosomes (for a review, see Ref. 3Ellgaard L. Helenius A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). These bindings involve ER-resident proteins, molecular chaperones that retain proteins until they have acquired a correct conformation ultimately enabling them to leave the ER. For many proteins a transport-competent configuration is critically associated with homodimerization or formation of a multimeric complex comprising the diverse subunits of the protein. These steps are subject to a quality control mechanism that discriminates between proteins in terms of their folding pattern and permits correctly folded proteins to exit the ER. The majority of the naturally occurring mutants implicated in diseases cannot traverse the quality control machinery of the ER and are retained in that organelle (1Stein M. Wandinger-Ness A. Roitbak T. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 374-381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In a few cases of the intestinal disorder congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency (CSID), however, arrest of the protein in the trans-Golgi, cis-Golgi, and ERGIC compartments is reminiscent of escaping the ER quality control and suggests the existence of a quality control mechanism operating beyond the ER (4Hauri H.P.

Hauri H.P. J. Clin. Investig. 1988; 82: 667-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is supported by another example of a cell surface protein that is blocked beyond the ER (most likely in thecis-Golgi): the temperature-sensitive tsO45 mutant of the G protein of the vesicular stomatitis virus (6Doms R.W. Keller D.S. Helenius A. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1957-1969Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). This mutant form undergoes several cycles of anterograde and retrograde trafficking between the ER and the cis-Golgi at the permissive temperature before acquisition of a transport-competent configuration. It is not clear whether mutant forms of SI that are localized in the Golgi are causally temperature-sensitive and would follow a pattern of folding mechanisms similar to the G protein. Temperature-sensitive mutants are characterized by a drastic alteration in their folding and biological activity above a certain temperature, known as the non-permissive temperature. Below this temperature the structure and function is restored to similar levels as the wild type proteins. There are few examples of temperature-sensitive mutants of membrane proteins that are implicated in diseases. One known temperature-sensitive mutant phenotype is the deletion mutant ΔF508 of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator that is responsible for the onset of the severe disease cystic fibrosis in almost 70% of the cases (7Cheng S.H. Gregory R.J. Marshall J. Paul S. Souza D.W. White G.A. O'Riordan C.R. Smith A.E. Cell. 1990; 63: 827-834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1418) Google Scholar). However, this mutant is exclusively localized in the ER and is therefore not implicated in a hypothetical quality control mechanism beyond the ER as proposed for SI phenotype II and the temperature-sensitive G protein. The arrest of the phenotype II of SI in the cis-Golgi coincides with a mutation of glutamine to proline at residue 1098 of the sucrase subunit (SIQ/P) (8Ouwendijk J. Moolenaar C.E. Peters W.J. Hollenberg C.P. Ginsel L.A. Fransen J.A. Naim H.Y. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 97: 633-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). It is proposed that this mutation is harbored within a cryptic signal responsible for the retention of the mutant protein in thecis-Golgi. Presumably this mutation could have induced a limited structural alteration in the SI protein not monitored by the quality control machinery in the ER permitting the mutant protein to escape the ER up to the level of ERGIC andcis-Golgi. Scanning the conformation of SI in this phenotype with several monoclonal antibodies revealed that only one of the monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) did not recognize the mutant protein indicating that gross alterations did not occur (8Ouwendijk J.

In this study we set out to investigate the folding properties and the biosynthetic features of the mutant phenotype II SIQ/P in CSID at reduced temperatures to determine whether this mutant possesses the properties of a temperature-sensitive mutant, anticipating a more detailed pattern of the folding events of the mutant and its potential interactions with ER components. Streptomycin, penicillin, glutamine, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, fetal calf serum, and trypsin were purchased from BioWest, Essen, Germany.

The cells were incubated in methionine-free minimum Eagle's medium containing 50 μCi of [35S]methionine for the indicated time intervals and chased in pulse-chase experiments with nonlabeled methionine for different periods of time. Subsequently the cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized with 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, 0.5% deoxycholate, and 0.5% Triton X-100 supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml antipain, and 50 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor for 30 min at 4 °C. After 1 h of preclearing with 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose, the immunoprecipitation was performed with the mAb anti-SI mixture and 50 μl of protein-A-Sepharose as described previously (13Jacob R. Weiner J.R. Stadge S. Naim H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10630-10637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). For the assessment of SI interactions with BiP or calnexin, the cellular extracts were immunoprecipitated with mAb anti-BiP or mAb anti-calnexin followed by immunoprecipitation of SI as described previously (14Jacob R.

The immunoprecipitates were further processed by SDS-PAGE according to Laemmli (15Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206658) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis the gels were fixed and analyzed by a phosphorimaging device (Bio-Rad). Wild type and mutant SI antigens were isolated from the surface of COS-1 cells as described previously (16Jacob R. Brewer C. Fransen J.A. Naim H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2712-2721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transiently transfected COS-1 cells were labeled with 50 μCi of [35S]methionine for 4 h at 37 °C, 12 h at 20 °C, or 12 h at 20 °C followed by 2 h at 37 °C. Subsequently the cells were shifted to 4 °C, and wild type or mutant SI expressed at the cell surface was labeled by mAb anti-SI added to the medium. The cells were solubilized in lysis buffer, and SI was immunoprecipitated with protein A-Sepharose prior to SDS-PAGE analysis. The immunoprecipitates from transiently transfected, [35S]methionine-labeled COS-1 cells were treated with 2, 20, or 500 μg/ml trypsin for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by cooling on ice at 4 °C and addition of 200 μg of soybean trypsin inhibitor (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Confocal images of living cells were acquired 2 days after transfection on a Leica TCS SP2 microscope with a ×63 water planapochromat lens (Leica Microsystems). Dual color CFP and YFP images were obtained by sequential scans with the 458 and 514 nm excitation lines of an argon laser and the optimal emission wavelength for CFP or YFP, respectively, as previously described (17Jacob R. Peters K. Naim H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8217-8225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). SI in phenotype II of CSID is predominantly expressed as an endoglycosidase H-sensitive mannose-rich polypeptide. Initial localization of SI in intestinal epithelial by immunoelectron microscopy using monoclonal anti-SI revealed an intensive labeling of the ER, the intermediate compartment ERGIC, and thecis-Golgi cisternae. Similar structural features and subcellular localization could also be demonstrated in non-intestinal cells as assessed in transfection experiments of mutant SI cDNA in COS-1 cells. These observations clearly indicate that the function of the mutation Q1098P in the sucrase domain is not specific for intestinal or polarized cells. The partial intracellular localization of the SI phenotype II in the ER, ERGIC, and cis-Golgi suggests that minimal folding requirements of the mutant SI protein were fulfilled permitting a partially folded protein to egress the ER to the cis-Golgi. Fig.1 A shows a pulse-chase analysis of COS cells expressing the mutant SIQ/P or wild type SI as a control. At physiological temperatures of 37 °C, no conversion of the endoglycosidase H-sensitive mannose-rich SIQ/P species to a complex glycosylated form could be observed as was seen in the control experiment. This indicates that the majority of the protein remains in the ER or is blocked in thecis-Golgi as previously demonstrated in immunofluorescence and electron microscopical analyses (8Ouwendijk J.

It is likely that the proportion that makes it through the Golgi apparatus has probably acquired correct folding through several cycles of anterograde and retrograde transport between thecis-Golgi and the ER. We wanted therefore to determine whether slowing down the processing rate of the mutant SI protein and prolongation of its residence time in the ER influence its structural features and biological activity. Furthermore the pulse-chase experiments showed that the SIQ/P protein undergoes intracellular degradation at 37 °C. We therefore compared the fate of SIQ/P under the two different labeling temperatures, 20 °C and 37 °C. Here a dramatic difference in the turnover rates was observed. While SIh was gradually degraded with increasing chase periods at 37 °C in Fig. 1 A, longer chase periods of up to 24 h at 20 °C resulted in an efficient conversion of mannose-rich SIh to a predominantly labeled complex glycosylated SIc. Interestingly this protein was now as enzymatically active as its wild type SI counterpart (Ref. 18Naim H.Y. Lacey S.W. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. J. Biol.

To further examine the stability and folding of SIQ/P at the permissive temperature, we probed its sensitivity toward trypsin. Correctly folded wild type brush border SIc is processed in the intestinal lumen to the two subunits sucrase and isomaltase by pancreatic trypsin. Thereafter the two species remain associated with each other through strong non-ionic interactions and are trypsin-resistant (19Hauri H.P. Wacker H. Rickli E.E. Bigler-Meier B. Quaroni A. Semenza G.

Changes in the protein folding of SI would be therefore monitored by variation in its susceptibility to trypsin. As shown before (8Ouwendijk J. Moolenaar C.E. Peters W.J. Hollenberg C.P. Ginsel L.A.

By contrast, SIQ/P synthesized and processed at 20 °C was digested to a pattern similar to the wild type protein, i.e. to the individual subunits I and S (Fig. 1 B) (note that the almost similar apparent molecular weights of I and S as well as their heavy glycosylation do not allow a clear separation of the two subunits electrophoretically (20Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7242-7253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). Further digestion with trypsin did not generate any alteration in the electrophoretic pattern compatible with a trypsin-resistant profile of SIQ/P synthesized and processed at 20 °C. The acquisition of a complex glycosylated protein pattern as well as trypsin resistance at 20 °C similar to the wild type enzyme indicates that SIQ/P exhibits characteristics of a temperature-sensitive protein. Under these conditions the SIQ/P protein exits the ER and is processed in the Golgi apparatus more efficiently than is the protein synthesized at 37 °C. We assessed therefore the intracellular localization of the SIQ/P at the various temperatures and determined whether this form is capable of reaching the cell surface after the temperature block has been eliminated. For this, the trafficking of SIQ/P as compared with the wild type species was examined in transfected COS-1 cells using confocal laser microscopy at the permissive and non-permissive temperatures. The cDNA encoding SIQ/P fused to the yellow variant of the green fluorescent protein (pSIQ/P-YFP) was used. Confocal analysis of these cells at 37 °C revealed a predominant uniform pattern of distribution of SIQ/P-YFP in the ER (Fig.2 A) and to some extent in the Golgi area. This is in line with the biochemical data in which a predominant mannose-rich glycosylated protein was detected. The wild type protein was detected in the ER and Golgi as well as at the cell surface (Fig. 2 B). At 20 °C the SIQ/P protein was predominantly localized to the Golgi membranes as assessed by the strong labeling of this organelle in cells expressing the SIQ/P-YFP protein (Fig. 2 C). This result supports the biochemical analysis, which demonstrated a substantial conversion of the mannose-rich species to the complex glycosylated mature protein. We next asked whether the acquired complex glycosylation of the SIQ/P mutant protein in the Golgi apparatus at 20 °C was sufficient for its further trafficking to the cell surface or whether the Q1098P mutation per se does hamper this transport despite maturation and retains the protein in the Golgi. Many membrane and secretory proteins that are destined for the cell surface undergo a transport block in the Golgi apparatus at 20 °C. This block is eliminated, and the protein transport continues at the physiologic temperature of 37 °C. To determine whether the SIQ/P mutant processed at 20 °C is capable of exiting the Golgi, the cells expressing the SIQ/P mutant were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min after the 20 °C block (Fig.2 D). Confocal images in living transfected cells show that SIQ/P-containing vesicles have started to pinch off thetrans-Golgi network membrane, and some vesicles have already exited this organelle. These vesicles were devoid of the Golgi protein marker galactosyltransferase (GT). To corroborate these data by a different approach cell surface immunoprecipitation of biosynthetically labeled cells expressing the SIQ/P mutant was performed (Fig. 2 E). Here the cells were labeled at 20 °C followed by a chase at 37 °C. The complex glycosylated SIQ/Pmolecule was isolated from the cell surface indicating that this protein has reached the cell surface and thus confirming the fluorescence data. At 20 °C no molecules were isolated from the cell surface, and the entire protein was retained intracellularly as it would be expected at this temperature. In sum, the data unequivocally demonstrate that the SIQ/P mutant is a typical temperature-sensitive mutant that acquires a complex glycosylated mature form at the permissive temperature and can be further transported thereafter to the cell surface at the non-permissive temperature. Notably this behavior indicates that the Q1098P mutation in the S subunit does not give rise to a Golgi retention signal but rather generates a folding determinant that cannot overcome a potential quality control operating in the cis-Golgi where phenotype II of CSID is blocked (21Fransen J.A. Hauri H.P. Ginsel L.A. Naim H.Y. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 45-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The temperature-sensitive properties of SIQ/P prompted us to investigate the interaction of this mutant with proteins of the folding machinery, such as BiP and calnexin, and compare this interaction to that of the wild type counterpart. First we analyzed the steady state binding of these proteins to the SI forms. Here transfected COS-1 cells expressing wild type as well as mutant SI were biosynthetically labeled with [35S]methionine continuously for 6 h, and the cellular detergent extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-BiP or anti-calnexin antibodies. The antigenic material bound to the beads was eluted and examined for the presence of SI by immunoprecipitation with mAb anti-SI. As shown in Fig. 3 A the binding of BiP to the wild type protein occurs during early stages of the biosynthesis when the SI protein is in its mannose-rich glycosylated form. This is in line with the pattern established for a variety of proteins interacting with this molecular chaperone. Likewise BiP was found associated with the mannose-rich form of the mutant SIQ/Pform. This mutant, however, bound more strongly than the wild type protein supporting a prolonged intracellular localization of this form in the ER. Similar binding profiles were obtained with calnexin (Fig.3 A). Here again calnexin bound more strongly the SIQ/P mutant than the wild type species. The binding kinetics of BiP and calnexin to the wild type and mutant forms SI were assessed by using a pulse-chase protocol. As shown in Fig.3 B BiP and calnexin bound strongly the mannose-rich mutant SIQ/P during the first time interval after 30 min of pulse. The binding capacity to BiP diminished after 30 min of chase at 20 °C, whereas the amount of mannose-rich mutant SIQ/Pbound to calnexin was increased at this time point. These patterns changed after 60 min of chase with a significant binding of SIQ/P to BiP and to a lesser extend to calnexin. Essentially a reversed binding pattern was obtained within 240 min of chase. Here more SIQ/P molecules were found associated with calnexin than with BiP, indicating that the mutant SI polypeptide is subject to cycles of association, dissociation, and reassociation with the ER-resident proteins BiP and calnexin. The sequential pattern of association of SIQ/P with BiP and calnexin changes when the protein is adequately folded to be transported to the medial andtrans-Golgi where it matures to a complex glycosylated protein at the permissive temperature. In conclusion, the mutant SIQ/P reveals characteristics of a temperature-sensitive mutant. Temperature-sensitive mutants of a gene are characterized by a marked drop in the level of activity or altered structural features of the gene product when the gene is expressed above a certain temperature (the non-permissive temperature). Below this temperature the activity and structure are recovered and are usually very similar to that of wild type. The acquisition of correct folding at the permissive temperature is in all likelihood the result of an anterograde and retrograde transport between the ER and thecis-Golgi. This is supported by the observation that several cycles of association and dissociation with the molecular chaperones BiP and calnexin take place. In this mechanism calnexin plays a central role in view of recent observations that have shown that a correctly folded sucrase subunit plays a critical role as a C-terminally located intramolecular chaperone in the folding of isomaltase by competing with calnexin in the binding to similar sites in isomaltase (22Jacob R. Purschel B. Naim H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32141-32148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The mutation Q1098P, which is located in the intramolecular chaperone sucrase, generates a misfolded sucrase species as shown by epitope mapping with monoclonal antibodies (9Moolenaar C.E. Ouwendijk J. Wittpoth M. Wisselaar H.A. Hauri H.P. Ginsel L.A. Naim H.Y. Fransen J.A. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 557-567Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with a subsequent loss of its function as an efficient competitor for calnexin in binding the isomaltase subunit. At the permissive temperature sucrase becomes correctly folded and capable of competing again with calnexin, substituting for calnexin, and generating a correctly folded pseudodimer with isomaltase. The mechanism proposed here is to our knowledge not only the first of its kind reported for an intestinal enzyme deficiency or an intestinal disorder but also for an endogenous cell surface membrane protein. Another known case of a protein that recycles between the ER and the Golgi is that of the tsO45 mutant of the G protein of the vesicular stomatitis virus (6Doms R.W. Keller D.S. Helenius A. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1957-1969Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). However, overexpression of the viral protein and possible saturation of the quality control machinery in the ER are factors that do not conform to the in vivo situation of an endogenous protein such as SI.
