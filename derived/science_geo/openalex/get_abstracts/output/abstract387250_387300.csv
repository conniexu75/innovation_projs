https://openalex.org/W2133302347,"Bitter taste receptors (TAS2Rs) on the tongue probably evolved to evoke signals for avoiding ingestion of plant toxins. We found expression of TAS2Rs on human airway smooth muscle (ASM) and considered these to be avoidance receptors for inhalants that, when activated, lead to ASM contraction and bronchospasm. TAS2R agonists such as saccharin, chloroquine and denatonium evoked increased intracellular calcium ([Ca²(+)](i)) in ASM in a Gβγ-, phospholipase Cβ (PLCβ)- and inositol trisphosphate (IP₃) receptor-dependent manner, which would be expected to evoke contraction. Paradoxically, bitter tastants caused relaxation of isolated ASM and dilation of airways that was threefold greater than that elicited by β-adrenergic receptor agonists. The relaxation induced by TAS2Rs is associated with a localized [Ca²(+)](i) response at the cell membrane, which opens large-conductance Ca²(+)-activated K(+) (BK(Ca)) channels, leading to ASM membrane hyperpolarization. Inhaled bitter tastants decreased airway obstruction in a mouse model of asthma. Given the need for efficacious bronchodilators for treating obstructive lung diseases, this pathway can be exploited for therapy with the thousands of known synthetic and naturally occurring bitter tastants."

https://openalex.org/W2039310245,"We conducted a multi-stage, genome-wide association study of bladder cancer with a primary scan of 591,637 SNPs in 3,532 affected individuals (cases) and 5,120 controls of European descent from five studies followed by a replication strategy, which included 8,382 cases and 48,275 controls from 16 studies. In a combined analysis, we identified three new regions associated with bladder cancer on chromosomes 22q13.1, 19q12 and 2q37.1: rs1014971, (P = 8 × 10⁻¹²) maps to a non-genic region of chromosome 22q13.1, rs8102137 (P = 2 × 10⁻¹¹) on 19q12 maps to CCNE1 and rs11892031 (P = 1 × 10⁻⁷) maps to the UGT1A cluster on 2q37.1. We confirmed four previously identified genome-wide associations on chromosomes 3q28, 4p16.3, 8q24.21 and 8q24.3, validated previous candidate associations for the GSTM1 deletion (P = 4 × 10⁻¹¹) and a tag SNP for NAT2 acetylation status (P = 4 × 10⁻¹¹), and found interactions with smoking in both regions. Our findings on common variants associated with bladder cancer risk should provide new insights into the mechanisms of carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2041514837,"Ian Tomlinson, Richard Houlston, Malcolm Dunlop and colleagues report results of a large genome-wide association study of colorectal cancer. They identify four new risk loci and suggest that many more loci of similar effect size are likely to exist. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified ten loci harboring common variants that influence risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC). To enhance the power to identify additional CRC risk loci, we conducted a meta-analysis of three GWAS from the UK which included a total of 3,334 affected individuals (cases) and 4,628 controls followed by multiple validation analyses including a total of 18,095 cases and 20,197 controls. We identified associations at four new CRC risk loci: 1q41 (rs6691170, odds ratio (OR) = 1.06, P = 9.55 × 10−10 and rs6687758, OR = 1.09, P = 2.27 × 10−9), 3q26.2 (rs10936599, OR = 0.93, P = 3.39 × 10−8), 12q13.13 (rs11169552, OR = 0.92, P = 1.89 × 10−10 and rs7136702, OR = 1.06, P = 4.02 × 10−8) and 20q13.33 (rs4925386, OR = 0.93, P = 1.89 × 10−10). In addition to identifying new CRC risk loci, this analysis provides evidence that additional CRC-associated variants of similar effect size remain to be discovered."
https://openalex.org/W1977535645,"S-nitrosylation of proteins by nitric oxide is a major mode of signalling in cells. S-nitrosylation can mediate the regulation of a range of proteins, including prominent nuclear proteins, such as HDAC2 (ref. 2) and PARP1 (ref. 3). The high reactivity of the nitric oxide group with protein thiols, but the selective nature of nitrosylation within the cell, implies the existence of targeting mechanisms. Specificity of nitric oxide signalling is often achieved by the binding of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) to target proteins, either directly or through scaffolding proteins such as PSD-95 (ref. 5) and CAPON. As the three principal isoforms of NOS--neuronal NOS (nNOS), endothelial NOS (eNOS) and inducible NOS (iNOS)--are primarily non-nuclear, the mechanisms by which nuclear proteins are selectively nitrosylated have been elusive. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is physiologically nitrosylated at its Cys 150 residue. Nitrosylated GAPDH (SNO-GAPDH) binds to Siah1, which possesses a nuclear localization signal, and is transported to the nucleus. Here, we show that SNO-GAPDH physiologically transnitrosylates nuclear proteins, including the deacetylating enzyme sirtuin-1 (SIRT1), histone deacetylase-2 (HDAC2) and DNA-activated protein kinase (DNA-PK). Our findings reveal a novel mechanism for targeted nitrosylation of nuclear proteins and suggest that protein-protein transfer of nitric oxide groups may be a general mechanism in cellular signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W2124977778,"Endothelial cells form a vascular niche that supports haematopoietic stem cell function. Akt activation in endothelial cells upregulates angiocrine factors to promote long-term haematopoietic stem cell repopulation capacity while co-activation of Akt and MAPK shift the balance towards maintenance and differentiation of their progenitors. Endothelial cells establish an instructive vascular niche that reconstitutes haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) through release of specific paracrine growth factors, known as angiocrine factors. However, the mechanism by which endothelial cells balance the rate of proliferation and lineage-specific differentiation of HSPCs is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that Akt activation in endothelial cells, through recruitment of mTOR, but not the FoxO pathway, upregulates specific angiocrine factors that support expansion of CD34−Flt3− KLS HSPCs with long-term haematopoietic stem cell (LT-HSC) repopulation capacity. Conversely, co-activation of Akt-stimulated endothelial cells with p42/44 MAPK shifts the balance towards maintenance and differentiation of the HSPCs. Selective activation of Akt1 in the endothelial cells of adult mice increased the number of colony forming units in the spleen and CD34−Flt3− KLS HSPCs with LT-HSC activity in the bone marrow, accelerating haematopoietic recovery. Therefore, the activation state of endothelial cells modulates reconstitution of HSPCs through the modulation of angiocrine factors, with Akt–mTOR-activated endothelial cells supporting the self-renewal of LT-HSCs and expansion of HSPCs, whereas MAPK co-activation favours maintenance and lineage-specific differentiation of HSPCs."
https://openalex.org/W2104548381,"In songbirds, the remarkable temporal precision of song is generated by a sparse sequence of bursts in the premotor nucleus HVC. To distinguish between two possible classes of models of neural sequence generation, we carried out intracellular recordings of HVC neurons in singing zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata). We found that the subthreshold membrane potential is characterized by a large, rapid depolarization 5–10 ms before burst onset, consistent with a synaptically connected chain of neurons in HVC. We found no evidence for the slow membrane potential modulation predicted by models in which burst timing is controlled by subthreshold dynamics. Furthermore, bursts ride on an underlying depolarization of ∼10-ms duration, probably the result of a regenerative calcium spike within HVC neurons that could facilitate the propagation of activity through a chain network with high temporal precision. Our results provide insight into the fundamental mechanisms by which neural circuits can generate complex sequential behaviours. The nature of the neural mechanism underlying sequence generation in the brain remains a fundamental unanswered question in neuroscience. Songbirds, in which single neurons in premotor areas of the brain fire coordinated bursts that are precisely timed to the dynamics of the song, provide an ideal model for its study. Long et al. now report a technical tour de force — intracellular recording in premotor HVC neurons in singing birds — which allows them to test models of burst generation. They found that membrane potential rapidly depolarizes 5–10 milliseconds before burst onset, consistent with models in which HVC neurons form synaptically connected chains. When songbirds sing, neurons in premotor areas fire coordinated bursts precisely timed to the dynamics of the song. The cellular mechanism for such sequence generation is unknown. These authors make the technical breakthrough of recording intracellularly in HVC neurons in singing birds, allowing them to test models of burst generation. They found that membrane potential rapidly depolarizes 5–10 ms before burst onset, consistent with models in which HVC neurons form synaptically connected chains."
https://openalex.org/W1978201430,"The mTOR pathway is a well-known regulator of cell size, and deregulation of mTOR has been observed in cilia-related diseases. Cilia modulate cell size by restricting LKB-1-mediated activation of AMPK to the basal body, which subsequently affects mTOR signalling. The mTOR pathway is the central regulator of cell size1. External signals from growth factors and nutrients converge on the mTORC1 multi-protein complex to modulate downstream targets, but how the different inputs are integrated and translated into specific cellular responses is incompletely understood2,3,4. Deregulation of the mTOR pathway occurs in polycystic kidney disease (PKD)5,6,7, where cilia (filiform sensory organelles) fail to sense urine flow because of inherited mutations in ciliary proteins8. We therefore investigated if cilia have a role in mTOR regulation. Here, we show that ablation of cilia in transgenic mice results in enlarged cells when compared with control animals. In vitro analysis demonstrated that bending of the cilia by flow is required for mTOR downregulation and cell-size control. Surprisingly, regulation of cell size by cilia is independent of flow-induced calcium transients, or Akt. However, the tumour-suppressor protein Lkb1 localises in the cilium, and flow results in increased AMPK phosphorylation at the basal body. Conversely, knockdown of Lkb1 prevents normal cell-size regulation under flow conditions. Our results demonstrate that the cilium regulates mTOR signalling and cell size, and identify the cilium-basal body compartment as a spatially restricted activation site for Lkb1 signalling."
https://openalex.org/W1985891852,"A role for Cu2+ ions in Alzheimer disease is often disputed, as it is believed that Cu2+ ions only promote nontoxic amorphous aggregates of amyloid-β (Aβ). In contrast with currently held opinion, we show that the presence of substoichiometric levels of Cu2+ ions in fact doubles the rate of production of amyloid fibers, accelerating both the nucleation and elongation of fiber formation. We suggest that binding of Cu2+ ions at a physiological pH causes Aβ to approach its isoelectric point, thus inducing self-association and fiber formation. We further show that Cu2+ ions bound to Aβ are consistently more toxic to neuronal cells than Aβ in the absence of Cu2+ ions, whereas Cu2+ ions in the absence of Aβ are not cytotoxic. The degree of Cu-Aβ cytotoxicity correlates with the levels of Cu2+ ions that accelerate fiber formation. We note the effect appears to be specific for Cu2+ ions as Zn2+ ions inhibit the formation of fibers. An active role for Cu2+ ions in accelerating fiber formation and promoting cell death suggests impaired copper homeostasis may be a risk factor in Alzheimer disease.

IntroductionAlzheimer disease (AD) 2The abbreviations used are: ADAlzheimer diseaseAβamyloid-β-peptideTEMtransmission electron microscopyThTthioflavin T. is characterized by extracellular amyloid plaques, composed predominantly of fibrillar amyloid-β peptide (Aβ), a 39–43-residue peptide. Genetic alterations underlying familial AD are associated with mutations or increased production of Aβ, indicating that Aβ plays a central role in the disease (1.Hardy J. Selkoe D.J. Science. 2002; 297: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (10796) Google Scholar).A notable characteristic of AD is altered metal ion concentrations in the brain and disrupted metal ion homeostasis (2.Barnham K.J. Bush A.I. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2008; 12: 222-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Cu2+ ions are found concentrated within senile plaques of AD patients directly bound to Aβ (3.Dong J.

Recent in vivo studies using a Drosophila model of AD have shown that impaired copper homeostasis enhances the toxic effects of Aβ (6.Sanokawa-Akakura R. Cao W. Allan K. Patel K. Ganesh A. Heiman G.

Furthermore, copper in a cholesterol high diet induces amyloid plaques and learning deficits in a rabbit model of AD (7.Sparks D.L. Schreurs B.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 11065-11069Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Other in vivo studies have shown that copper homeostasis can influence AD pathology. In contrast to the Drosophila model, transgenic mice have shown a reduced AD pathology with increased intracellular copper levels (8.Phinney A.L. Drisaldi B. Schmidt S.D. Lugowski S. Coronado V.

Alternatively, oligomers may be in competition with fiber formation. Both possibilities require the self-association of monomeric Aβ, and thus factors that affect fibrillization will also influence oligomer generation.The mechanism by which Aβ is toxic is hotly debated (11.Yankner B.A. Lu T.

It has been proposed that Aβ can form ion channels or pores or can thin the membrane, all of which will cause membrane leakage and loss of cellular Ca2+ ion homeostasis. One popular hypothesis is that the membrane integrity is compromised by lipid peroxidation from reactive oxygen species, which is a key feature of the pathogenesis of AD (16.Butterfield D.A. Reed T.

It is well established that hydrogen peroxide mediates Aβ toxicity and the antioxidant enzyme catalase protects cells from Aβ toxicity (18.Behl C. Davis J.B. Lesley R. Schubert D.

Furthermore, extracellular Cu2+ levels in the brain interstitial fluid are 100 nm. A picomolar affinity for Cu2+ allows Aβ to compete for Cu2+ ions with other extracellular Cu2+ chelators, especially at the synapse during neuronal depolarization where fluxes of Cu2+ are reported to be 20–250 μm (39.Kardos J.

These initial studies did not make the distinction between amorphous aggregates, which are nontoxic to cells, and the formation of amyloid fibers.

Furthermore, we wanted to establish whether there was a link between the influence of Cu2+ ions on fiber formation and the effect of Cu2+ ions on cell toxicity of Aβ.CONCLUSIONSCu2+-Aβ is more toxic to PC12 cells than Aβ on its own; furthermore, cytotoxic effects are related to the ability of Cu2+ ions to promote amyloid fibers and protofibrils. We suggest that Cu2+ ions increase the rate of fiber formation, at pH 7.4, by causing Aβ to approach its isoelectric point. To put our observation in context, the increase in fiber growth rates measured here due to Cu2+ ions is comparable with that observed for (metal-free) Aβ(1–40) mutants associated with familial early onset AD (E22K/G/Q), where a halving of the growth times (t50) of fiber formation is also reported (60.Murakami K.

IntroductionAlzheimer disease (AD) 2The abbreviations used are: ADAlzheimer diseaseAβamyloid-β-peptideTEMtransmission electron microscopyThTthioflavin T. is characterized by extracellular amyloid plaques, composed predominantly of fibrillar amyloid-β peptide (Aβ), a 39–43-residue peptide. Genetic alterations underlying familial AD are associated with mutations or increased production of Aβ, indicating that Aβ plays a central role in the disease (1.Hardy J. Selkoe D.J.

Recent in vivo studies using a Drosophila model of AD have shown that impaired copper homeostasis enhances the toxic effects of Aβ (6.Sanokawa-Akakura R. Cao W. Allan K. Patel K. Ganesh A. Heiman G.

Alternatively, oligomers may be in competition with fiber formation. Both possibilities require the self-association of monomeric Aβ, and thus factors that affect fibrillization will also influence oligomer generation.The mechanism by which Aβ is toxic is hotly debated (11.Yankner B.A. Lu T.

It has been proposed that Aβ can form ion channels or pores or can thin the membrane, all of which will cause membrane leakage and loss of cellular Ca2+ ion homeostasis.

Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 4388-4402Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Affinity measurements of the Cu2+-Aβ complex have been revised, indicating a considerably tighter affinity than previously believed, setting the conditional dissociation constant, pH 7.4, at 60 × 10−12 m (25.Sarell C.J.

Furthermore, extracellular Cu2+ levels in the brain interstitial fluid are 100 nm. A picomolar affinity for Cu2+ allows Aβ to compete for Cu2+ ions with other extracellular Cu2+ chelators, especially at the synapse during neuronal depolarization where fluxes of Cu2+ are reported to be 20–250 μm (39.Kardos J.

Furthermore, extracellular Cu2+ levels in the brain interstitial fluid are 100 nm. A picomolar affinity for Cu2+ allows Aβ to compete for Cu2+ ions with other extracellular Cu2+ chelators, especially at the synapse during neuronal depolarization where fluxes of Cu2+ are reported to be 20–250 μm (39.Kardos J.

CONCLUSIONSCu2+-Aβ is more toxic to PC12 cells than Aβ on its own; furthermore, cytotoxic effects are related to the ability of Cu2+ ions to promote amyloid fibers and protofibrils. We suggest that Cu2+ ions increase the rate of fiber formation, at pH 7.4, by causing Aβ to approach its isoelectric point.

In this study, we found that vitamin D receptor expression was induced in a CD4+ effector T cell lineage, Th17 cells, which required the transcription factors, RORα, RORγt, and STAT3. Treatment of mice with an active ligand of vitamin D receptor (VDR), 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25D3), ameliorated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, accompanied with reduced IL-17 and IL-17F expression. In vitro, treatment of CD4+ T cells with the physiological doses of 1,25D3 preferentially inhibited cytokine production by Th17 cells, in a VDR-dependent manner, without affecting the expression of transcription factors or surface molecules. Moreover, at these concentrations, cytokine expression was suppressed only at protein but not at mRNA levels. Stimulation of Th17 cells with 1,25D3, in a concentration-dependent manner, induced the expression of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), a molecule involved in endoplasmic reticulum stress and translational inhibition. In addition, overexpression of CHOP in developing Th17 cells suppressed their cytokine production. Our results suggest a novel, post-transcriptional mechanism whereby Th17 cytokines are inhibited by VDR, which may underscore future therapeutic usage of vitamin D in treatment of autoimmune diseases."

Despite increasing recognition of the importance of this process, an extremely limited number of small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) protein ligases (E3s) have been identified. Here we show that at least some members of the functionally diverse tripartite motif (TRIM) superfamily are SUMO E3s. These TRIM proteins bind both the SUMO-conjugating enzyme Ubc9 and substrates and strongly enhance transfer of SUMOs from Ubc9 to these substrates. Among the substrates of TRIM SUMO E3s are the tumor suppressor p53 and its principal antagonist Mdm2. The E3 activity depends on the TRIM motif, suggesting it to be the first widespread SUMO E3 motif. Given the large number of TRIM proteins, our results may greatly expand the identified SUMO E3s. Furthermore, TRIM E3 activity may be an important contributor to SUMOylation specificity and the versatile functions of TRIM proteins."

In response to ischemia-reperfusion, glial cells stiffened significantly in wild-type mice and rats but were unchanged in GFAP−/− Vim−/− mice. Cell stiffness (elastic modulus) correlated with the density of IFs. These results support the hypothesis that rigid glial scars impair nerve regeneration and that IFs are important determinants of cellular viscoelasticity in reactive glia.

https://openalex.org/W2064398546,"The Rickettsia protein Sca2 was previously implicated in actin ‘comet tail’ formation and bacterial cell motility. Sca2 is now found to possess formin-like properties and assembles long, unbranched actin filaments. Diverse intracellular pathogens subvert the host actin-polymerization machinery to drive movement within and between cells during infection. Rickettsia in the spotted fever group (SFG) are Gram-negative, obligate intracellular bacterial pathogens that undergo actin-based motility and assemble distinctive 'comet tails' that consist of long, unbranched actin filaments1,2. Despite this distinct organization, it was proposed that actin in Rickettsia comet tails is nucleated by the host Arp2/3 complex and the bacterial protein RickA, which assemble branched actin networks3,4. However, a second bacterial gene, sca2, was recently implicated in actin-tail formation by R. rickettsii5. Here, we demonstrate that Sca2 is a bacterial actin-assembly factor that functionally mimics eukaryotic formin proteins. Sca2 nucleates unbranched actin filaments, processively associates with growing barbed ends, requires profilin for efficient elongation, and inhibits the activity of capping protein, all properties shared with formins. Sca2 localizes to the Rickettsia surface and is sufficient to promote the assembly of actin filaments in cytoplasmic extract. These results suggest that Sca2 mimics formins to determine the unique organization of actin filaments in Rickettsia tails and drive bacterial motility, independently of host nucleators."

However, the specific mechanisms of T cell transformation downstream of TLX1 remain to be elucidated. Here we show that transgenic expression of human TLX1 in mice induces T-ALL with frequent deletions and mutations in Bcl11b (encoding B cell leukemia/lymphoma-11B) and identify the presence of recurrent mutations and deletions in BCL11B in 16% of human T-ALLs. Most notably, mouse TLX1 tumors were typically aneuploid and showed a marked defect in the activation of the mitotic checkpoint. Mechanistically, TLX1 directly downregulates the expression of CHEK1 (encoding CHK1 checkpoint homolog) and additional mitotic control genes and induces loss of the mitotic checkpoint in nontransformed preleukemic thymocytes. These results identify a previously unrecognized mechanism contributing to chromosomal missegregation and aneuploidy active at the earliest stages of tumor development in the pathogenesis of cancer."

Decorin binds and down-regulates several RTKs, including Met, the receptor for hepatocyte growth factor. Here we demonstrate that decorin blocks several biological activities mediated by the Met signaling axis, including cell scatter, evasion, and migration. These effects were mediated by a profound down-regulation of noncanonical β-catenin levels. In addition, Myc, a downstream target of β-catenin, was markedly down-regulated by decorin, whereas phosphorylation of Myc at threonine 58 was markedly induced. The latter is known to destabilize Myc and target it for proteasomal degradation. We also discovered that systemic delivery of decorin using three distinct tumor xenograft models caused down-regulation of Met and a concurrent suppression of β-catenin and Myc levels. We found that decorin protein core labeled with the near infrared dye IR800 specifically targeted the tumor cells expressing Met. Even 68-h post-injection, decorin was found to reside within the tumor xenografts with little or no binding to other tissues.

https://openalex.org/W2032217719,"The Krüppel-like zinc-finger protein GLI1 functions as a downstream transcription factor of Hedgehog signaling and plays a pivotal role in the cellular proliferation of many types of tumors, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA). PDA develops from dysplastic lesions called pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) through a multistep carcinogenesis process that changes its cellular characteristics, including a mucin expression profile. Increased expression of a gel-forming mucin, MUC5AC, was previously revealed as a major biomarker for the poor prognosis of PDA patients, but the molecular mechanisms responsible for its expression and correlation with poor prognosis are not fully understood. Here we show that MUC5AC is a direct transcriptional target of GLI1 in PDA cells. Overexpression of GLI1 enhanced MUC5AC expression, and a double knockdown of GLI1 and GLI2 suppressed endogenous MUC5AC expression in PDA cells. Luciferase reporter assays revealed that GLI1 and GLI2 can activate the MUC5AC promoter through its conserved CACCC-box-like cis-regulatory elements. We also found that GLI1-upregulated MUC5AC was expressed in the intercellular junction between cultured PDA cells and interfered with the membrane localization of E-cadherin, leading to decreased E-cadherin-dependent cell–cell adhesion and promoting the migration and invasion of PDA cells. Consistently, GLI1 induced the nuclear accumulation and target gene expression of β-catenin in a MUC5AC-dependent manner. Finally, immunohistochemical analysis revealed that GLI1 expression statistically correlated with MUC5AC expression and also with altered subcellular localization of E-cadherin and β-catenin in PanIN lesions and PDA.

YAP and TAZ both possess WW domains, which are important protein-protein interaction modules that mediate interaction with proline-rich motifs, most commonly PPXY. The WW domains of YAP have complex regulatory roles as exemplified by recent reports showing that they can positively or negatively influence YAP activity in a cell and context-specific manner. In this study, we show that the WW domain of TAZ is important for it to transform both MCF10A and NIH3T3 cells and to activate transcription of ITGB2 but not CTGF, as introducing point mutations into the WW domain of TAZ (WWm) abolished its transforming and transcription-promoting ability. Using a proteomic approach, we discovered potential regulatory proteins that interact with TAZ WW domain and identified Wbp2. The interaction of Wbp2 with TAZ is dependent on the WW domain of TAZ and the PPXY-containing C-terminal region of Wbp2. Knockdown of endogenous Wbp2 suppresses, whereas overexpression of Wbp2 enhances, TAZ-driven transformation. Forced interaction of WWm with Wbp2 by direct C-terminal fusion of full-length Wbp2 or its TAZ-interacting C-terminal domain restored the transforming and transcription-promoting ability of TAZ. These results suggest that the WW domain-mediated interaction with Wbp2 promotes the transforming ability of TAZ."

https://openalex.org/W2022064271,"VEGF was first described as vascular permeability factor, a potent inducer of vascular leakage. Genetic evidence indicates that VEGF-stimulated endothelial proliferation in vitro and angiogenesis in vivo depend on heparan sulfate, but a requirement for heparan sulfate in vascular hyperpermeability has not been explored. Here we show that altering endothelial cell heparan sulfate biosynthesis in vivo decreases hyperpermeability induced by both VEGF(165) and VEGF(121). Because VEGF(121) does not bind heparan sulfate, the requirement for heparan sulfate suggested that it interacted with VEGF receptors rather than the ligand. By applying proximity ligation assays to primary brain endothelial cells, we show a direct interaction in situ between heparan sulfate and the VEGF receptor, VEGFR2. Furthermore, the number of heparan sulfate-VEGFR2 complexes increased in response to both VEGF(165) and VEGF(121). Genetic or heparin lyase-mediated alteration of endothelial heparan sulfate attenuated phosphorylation of VEGFR2 in response to VEGF(165) and VEGF(121), suggesting that the functional VEGF receptor complex contains heparan sulfate. Pharmacological blockade of heparan sulfate-protein interactions inhibited hyperpermeability in vivo, suggesting heparan sulfate as a potential target for treating hyperpermeability associated with ischemic disease."
https://openalex.org/W2018630214,"We have previously identified lipocalin 2 (Lcn2) as a cytokine playing a critical role in the regulation of body fat mass, lipid metabolism, and insulin resistance. Lcn2 deficiency reduces PPARγ gene expression in adipocytes. In this study, we investigated the role of Lcn2 in PPARγ activation and function via assessing the insulin sensitization and fatty acid (FA) homeostasis of PPARγ agonist in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity in Lcn2−/− mice. We found that rosiglitazone (Rosi) significantly improved insulin sensitivity in Lcn2−/− mice as effectively as in wild-type (WT) mice; unfed-state levels of blood glucose, free FAs, and triglycerides (TGs) were significantly reduced after a 25-d treatment of Rosi in Lcn2−/− mice. However, Rosi action on fat deposition and FA homeostasis was altered; Rosi-induced body weight and subcutaneous fat gain and liver lipid accumulation were markedly lessened in Lcn2−/− mice. The results of in vivo metabolic labeling showed that Rosi markedly reduced de novo lipogenesis in adipose tissue of Lcn2−/− mice. In brown adipose tissue (BAT), the expression of the genes functioning in TG hydrolysis and mitochondrial oxidation was up-regulated more in Lcn2−/− than in WT mice. Most strikingly, Rosi stimulated significantly higher levels of uncoupling protein-1 expression in BAT, and completely rescued cold intolerance in Lcn2−/− mice. We demonstrate that Lcn2 is a critical selective modulator of PPARγ activation and function in lipid homeostasis and energy expenditure.—Jin, D., Guo, H., Bu, Y.

https://openalex.org/W2160433176,"Metastasis accounts for the majority of cancer-related deaths. Accurate prediction of metastatic potential of tumors has been elusive, and the search for clinically useful markers continues. We previously reported that GIV/Girdin triggers tumor cell migration by virtue of a C-terminal guanine-nucleotide exchange factor motif that activates Gαi. Here we identify GIV as a metastasis-related protein whose full-length transcript (GIV-fl) is expressed exclusively in highly invasive colon, breast, and pancreatic carcinoma cells and not in their poorly invasive counterparts. A prospective, exploratory biomarker study conducted on a cohort of 56 patients with stage II colorectal cancer revealed a significant correlation between GIV-fl expression in tumor epithelium and shortened metastasis-free survival. Survival rate for patients with GIV-fl-positive tumors is significantly reduced compared with the patients with GIV-fl-negative tumors [P<0.0001; hazard ratio=0.076; CI=0.052-0.30 (95%)]. At the 5-yr mark, survival is 100% in the GIV-fl-negative group and 62 ± 9% (mean±SE; P=6×10(-5)) in the GIV-fl-positive group. Furthermore, GIV-fl expression predicts a risk of mortality independent of the microsatellite stability status, a well-established prognosticator of colorectal cancers. We conclude that GIV-fl is a novel metastasis-related protein and an independent adverse prognosticator that may serve as a useful adjunct to traditional staging strategies in colorectal carcinoma."

TAG and SE are hydrophobic compounds separated from the aqueous cellular environment of the cytoplasm in specialized structures called lipid droplets (1Martin S. Parton R.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). Lipid droplets are dynamic organelles that play important roles in the biosynthesis, mobilization, and trafficking of intracellular neutral lipids. They function in close apposition with other organelles, particularly the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), endosomes, mitochondria, and peroxisomes (2Goodman J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 28005-28009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 3Murphy S. Martin S. Parton R.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1791: 441-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar).In the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the formation of lipid droplets is tightly linked to the synthesis of TAG and SE. The diacylglycerol acyltransferases encoded by the DGA1 and LRO1 genes (Fig. 1) are the main enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of TAG (4Oelkers P. Cromley D. Padamsee M. Billheimer J.T.

These four enzymes account for all TAG and SE biosynthesis in yeast, which begins during exponential growth and reaches its peak as cells enter stationary phase (9Müllner H. Daum G. Acta Biochim. Pol. 2004; 51: 323-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). During times of energy scarcity or upon recovery from stationary phase when exposed to glucose, TAG degradation occurs via the activity of lipid hydrolases encoded by the TGL3, TGL4, and TGL5 genes (10Athenstaedt K.

Cell. 2009; 33: 53-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The products of TAG degradation, diacylglycerols (DAG) and free fatty acids, also serve as precursors for membrane lipid synthesis (13Taylor F.R. Parks L.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 575: 204-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) as well as for energy production when free fatty acids are the only carbon source available in the growth medium (14Rajakumari S. Grillitsch K. Daum G. Prog. Lipid Res. 2008; 47: 157-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). At the cellular level, TAG degradation is up-regulated by Cdc28p/Cdk1p-dependent phosphorylation of the Tgl4p lipase (12Kurat C.F. Wolinski H. Petschnigg J. Kaluarachchi S. Andrews B. Natter K. Kohlwein S.D. Mol. Cell. 2009; 33: 53-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Lipolysis contributes to bud formation, presumably by providing precursors for synthesis of lipids involved in membrane biogenesis or signaling (12Kurat C.F. Wolinski H. Petschnigg J. Kaluarachchi S. Andrews B. Natter K. Kohlwein S.D. Mol. Cell. 2009; 33: 53-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Conversely, impairment in membrane trafficking leads to a block in phospholipid synthesis and concomitant TAG accumulation (15Gaspar M.L. Jesch S.A. Viswanatha R. Antosh A.L. Brown W.J. Kohlwein S.D.

The sole growth phenotypes relative to wild type that have been reported for this strain are unsaturated fatty acid-induced toxicity and a prolonged lag phase after transfer to fresh YPD media (17Garbarino J.

No significant change in growth of this strain was observed during exponential or stationary phase (4Oelkers P. Cromley D. Padamsee M. Billheimer J.T. Sturley S.L. J. Biol.

These data suggest that the reserve of TAG and SE is not essential to sustain growth in yeast, at least when cells grow in rich media.Certain mutants, defective in membrane trafficking (Sec−), were shown to exhibit increased TAG synthesis at the expense of phospholipid synthesis when shifted to a temperature that restricted membrane trafficking and cell growth (15Gaspar M.L. Jesch S.A. Viswanatha R. Antosh A.L. Brown W.J. Kohlwein S.D. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 25735-25751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). That study specifically showed that deleting the DAG acyltransferases, Dga1p and Lro1p, in the sec13-1 mutant, defective in membrane and protein transport from the ER, led to a lowering of the temperature at which the mutant could grow (i.e. its restrictive temperature). The lowering of the restrictive temperature in the sec13-1dga1Δlro1Δ strain, was especially pronounced when it was grown in the absence of the phospholipid precursor, inositol. In wild type cells, lack of inositol supplementation results in a substantial reduction in the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol (PI) (19Gaspar M.L. Aregullin M.A. Jesch S.A. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 22773-22785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 20Kelley M.J. Bailis A.M. Henry S.A. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18078-18085Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The above-summarized evidence suggests that the cell coordinates the synthesis and breakdown of storage lipids with its demand for membrane lipid synthesis. Consistent with this idea, we showed in a previous study that the fatty acids required for the rapid burst of PI synthesis after inositol supplementation to cells deprived of inositol are derived in part from both de novo fatty acid synthesis and phosphatidylcholine (PC) turnover (19Gaspar M.L. Aregullin M.A. Jesch S.A. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 22773-22785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 21Loewen C.J. Gaspar M.L. Jesch S.A. Delon C. Ktistakis N.T. Henry S.A. Levine T.P. Science. 2004; 304: 1644-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). However, these two sources of fatty acids do not fully account for the burst in PI synthesis (19Gaspar M.L. Aregullin M.A. Jesch S.A. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 22773-22785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), suggesting that additional fatty acids might be derived from hydrolysis of TAG. In the current study we tested the ability of the cells to grow in the absence of inositol and to rapidly restore PI content in response to inositol reintroduction when they are unable to mobilize TAG. We report that upon inositol reintroduction, the dga1Δlro1Δare1Δare2Δ strain, unable to synthesize TAG or SE, and the tgl3Δtgl4Δtgl5Δ strain, lacking the TAG lipases, both exhibit slow recovery of PI content in comparison to wild type cells. However, only the dga1Δlro1Δare1Δare2Δ strain failed to grow in the absence of inositol. Thus, failure to hydrolyze TAG does not fully explain the Ino− phenotype of the dga1Δlro1Δare1Δare2Δ strain. We present evidence that this mutant exhibits reduced synthesis of PI even when grown continuously in the presence of exogenous inositol. The mutant also devotes a larger percentage of newly synthesized PI to the synthesis of inositol-containing sphingolipids for which PI serves as a precursor.DISCUSSIONThe Ino− phenotype is classically associated with a deficiency in expression of INO1, the structural gene for the inositol-3-phosphate synthase (23Carman G.M. Henry S.A. Prog. Lipid Res. 1999; 38: 361-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 39Greenberg M.L. Lopes J.M. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 1-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, we report that the dga1Δlro1Δare1Δare2Δ mutant, which totally lacks lipid droplets (4Oelkers P. Cromley D. Padamsee M. Billheimer J.T. Sturley S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8877-8881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 16Sandager L. Gustavsson M.H. Ståhl U. Dahlqvist A. Wiberg E. Banas A. Lenman M. Ronne H. Stymne S. J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 6478-6482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), exhibited no significant defect in INO1 expression at 37 °C in I−C− medium compared with wild type. Nevertheless, its ability to grow on agar plates under these conditions was greatly reduced (Fig. 2). Immediately after a shift of actively growing cells to I−C+ medium at 37 °C, the mutant actually exhibited higher INO1 expression than the wild type strain (Fig. 5), but within a few hours after the shift to I−C+ medium at 37 °C, INO1 expression was similar to that in the wild type strain. The dga1Δlro1Δare1Δare2Δ strain is not the first mutant reported to exhibit an Ino− phenotype and yet to be able to express INO1. The sac1Δ mutant (40Rivas M.P. Kearns B.G. Xie Z. Guo S. Sekar M.C.

Cell. 1999; 10: 2235-2250Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and mutants defective in the protein kinase C (PKC) stress response pathway also have Ino− phenotypes and yet express INO1 (30Nunez L.R. Jesch S.A. Gaspar M.L. Almaguer C. Villa-Garcia M. Ruiz-Noriega M. Patton-Vogt J. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 34204-34217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Moreover, PKC signaling is triggered both by growth in the absence of inositol and by growth at high temperature (30Nunez L.R. Jesch S.A. Gaspar M.L. Almaguer C. Villa-Garcia M. Ruiz-Noriega M. Patton-Vogt J. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 34204-34217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 41Levin D.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol.

The Ino− phenotypes of mutants defective in the PKC pathway, like that of the dga1Δlro1Δare1Δare2Δ mutant, are strengthened in the presence of choline at 37 °C (30Nunez L.R. Jesch S.A. Gaspar M.L.

Growth in the absence of inositol activates a number of stress response pathways in addition to PKC (43Jesch S.A. Liu P. Zhao X. Wells M.T. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24070-24083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The phenotype of the dga1Δlro1Δare1Δare2Δ strain suggests that the absence of storage lipid synthesis adds to the stress-associated with growth in I−C+ medium at 37 °C. The fact that the mutant devotes a higher proportion of newly synthesized PI to sphingolipid synthesis than the wild type strain under these conditions is consistent with this hypothesis, as sphingolipids have been implicated in several stress response pathways including PKC signaling (44Dickson R.C. J. Lipid Res. 2008; 49: 909-921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar).However, the mutant also displayed alterations in phospholipid biosynthesis including reduced synthesis of PI even when grown continuously in I+C+ medium (Fig. 6), a growth condition under which inositol was completely derived from the medium. Labeling of PA, CDP-DAG, and PS were also lower in the mutant in comparison to wild type in the presence of inositol, suggesting that the mutant synthesizes PA, the immediate precursor of CDP-DAG, PI, and PS at a reduced rate. Because the INO1 gene was completely repressed in the mutant as well as in the wild type strain in medium containing inositol (Fig. 5), the decrease in PI synthesis in the mutant under these conditions (Fig. 6) is clearly independent from its ability to derepress the INO1 gene or its gene product, inositol-3-phosphate synthase. Moreover, in the mutant, in comparison to wild type, newly synthesized PI was also utilized to a greater extent in the synthesis of inositol-containing sphingolipids, especially when it was growing in the absence of inositol, a topic that will be discussed below. Based on these observations, we conclude that the storage lipid synthesis actively influences the metabolism of membrane lipids, both phospholipids and sphingolipids, in logarithmically growing cells.Lack of TAG Hydrolysis in Logarithmically Growing Cells Attenuates the Burst in PI Synthesis in Response to Inositol ReintroductionIn studies on stationary-phase cells reentering active growth, Taylor and Parks in 1979 (13Taylor F.R. Parks L.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 575: 204-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) proposed that fatty acids derived from TAG are utilized for the synthesis of phospholipids upon resumption of growth. Most recently, the lipid hydrolases that catalyze TAG degradation were identified (10Athenstaedt K. Daum G. J. Biol.

In this study we report that both the dga1Δlro1Δare1Δare2Δ mutant, which lacks the ability to produce TAG (4Oelkers P. Cromley D. Padamsee M. Billheimer J.T. Sturley S.L. J. Biol.

Consistent with these results, TAG is consumed in proliferating wild type cells upon inositol reintroduction coincident with the rebuilding of PI content. We propose a new metabolic role for TAG as donor of fatty acids for the synthesis of PI in logarithmically growing yeast cells, particularly when inositol is reintroduced to cultures previously lacking this lipid precursor.However, the dga1Δlro1Δare1Δare2Δ strain also exhibits impaired growth in medium lacking inositol. This growth defect is not simply due to the inability of the dga1Δlro1Δare1Δare2Δ mutant to mobilize TAG for PI synthesis, as the tgl3Δtgl4Δtgl5Δ strain is able to sustain growth in I− medium at 37 °C in the presence of choline. As we discuss below, the ability to synthesize TAG was shown to be protective under conditions of impaired membrane trafficking and declining phospholipid synthesis (15Gaspar M.L. Jesch S.A. Viswanatha R. Antosh A.L. Brown W.J. Kohlwein S.D. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 25735-25751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In addition, the reduced recovery of PI content immediately after inositol reintroduction displayed by both mutants in comparison to wild type suggests that a pool of fatty acids derived from TAG degradation may be used for rapid restoration of PI after inositol reintroduction. The data presented here also confirm the combined contribution of de novo fatty acid synthesis and PC turnover for the burst of PI content after inositol reintroduction, as previously reported (19Gaspar M.L. Aregullin M.A. Jesch S.A. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 22773-22785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Thus, we conclude that there are at least three different metabolic pathways capable of providing fatty acids for the dramatic increase in PI upon inositol reintroduction in wild type cells.The Absence of Lipid Droplets Affects Synthesis of Both PI and Inositol-containing SphingolipidsThe Ino− phenotype of the dga1Δlro1Δare1Δare2Δ strain is clearly not due simply to its inability to mobilize TAG, and thus, the inability to store fatty acids in TAG and SE must contribute to its phenotype. Despite the fact that the dga1Δlro1Δare1Δare2Δ mutant is not able to store fatty acids in either TAG or SE, it is viable under the culture conditions employed in the studies by Oelkers et al. (4Oelkers P. Cromley D. Padamsee M. Billheimer J.T. Sturley S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8877-8881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) and Sandager et al. (16Sandager L. Gustavsson M.H. Ståhl U. Dahlqvist A. Wiberg E. Banas A. Lenman M. Ronne H. Stymne S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6478-6482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). These two studies showed that storage lipids are not essential to sustain active logarithmic growth in yeast. However, TAG hydrolysis does play an important role in the recovery of cells from stationary phase into active growth (12Kurat C.F. Wolinski H. Petschnigg J. Kaluarachchi S. Andrews B. Natter K. Kohlwein S.D. Mol. Cell. 2009; 33: 53-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 13Taylor F.R. Parks L.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 575: 204-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Moreover, active TAG biosynthesis was shown to be protective under conditions of secretory stress (15Gaspar M.L. Jesch S.A. Viswanatha R. Antosh A.L. Brown W.J. Kohlwein S.D. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 25735-25751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The sec13-1 strain, which has a defect in COPII vesicle trafficking from the ER when shifted to its restrictive temperature of 37 °C, experienced a dramatic decrease in phospholipid synthesis relative to the wild type control, whereas synthesis of TAG increased. Thus, it appears that when membrane trafficking pathways are compromised, synthesis of phospholipids required for membrane proliferation declines in a fashion that is coordinated with the slowing of membrane trafficking. Under these conditions, excess fatty acids are channeled into TAG (15Gaspar M.L. Jesch S.A. Viswanatha R. Antosh A.L. Brown W.J. Kohlwein S.D. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 25735-25751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Moreover, when the genes encoding the DAG acyltransferases, Dga1p and Lro1p, were deleted in the sec13-1 mutant, the restrictive temperature of the sec13-1 dga1Δ lro1Δ strain decreased by two degrees compared with the parental strain (sec13-1 DGA1 LRO1) in media lacking inositol (15Gaspar M.L. Jesch S.A. Viswanatha R. Antosh A.L. Brown W.J. Kohlwein S.D. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 25735-25751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Thus, the increased synthesis of TAG appears to serve under these conditions to absorb the excess fatty acids not being used in membrane proliferation, providing a degree of protection under conditions of secretory stress (15Gaspar M.L. Jesch S.A. Viswanatha R. Antosh A.L. Brown W.J. Kohlwein S.D. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 25735-25751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar).The above evidence suggests that both TAG synthesis and breakdown are interdependent with ongoing membrane lipid synthesis. In agreement with these reports, we found that the lack of storage lipids in the dga1Δlro1Δare1Δare2Δ mutant has a profound impact on the synthesis of membrane lipids. The inability of the mutant to synthesize TAG and SE affects the synthesis of all the phospholipids derived directly from PA (Fig. 6), and this effect is not specific to PI synthesis alone. These results indicate that the storage lipids in lipid droplets are required to maintain normal rates of phospholipid synthesis in proliferating cells. Furthermore, the dga1Δlro1Δare1Δare2Δ mutant utilizes more of its newly synthesized PI in the formation of inositol-containing sphingolipids than the wild type strain. In contrast, the tgl3Δtgl4Δtgl5Δ mutant was reported to exhibit decreased formation of sphingolipids in comparison to wild type (45Rajakumari S. Rajasekharan R. Daum G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1801: 1314-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).Sphingolipids together with sterols are highly enriched in the plasma membrane (46Hechtberger P. Zinser E. Saf R. Hummel K.

Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 741-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), where they are believed to form microdomains within a phospholipid environment, referred to as lipid rafts (50Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8019) Google Scholar, 51Simons K. van Meer G. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6197-6202Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). Thus, the maintenance of sphingolipid synthesis in the dga1Δlro1Δare1Δare2Δ mutant despite lower PI synthesis may be correlated with the elevated synthesis of free sterols seen in the mutant under all growth conditions examined (Fig. 8). It has also been proposed that lipid droplets are in part involved in the transport of free sterols from the ER to the plasma membrane in wild type cells (52Sorger D. Athenstaedt K. Hrastnik C. Daum G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31190-31196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Because this mode of transport is not possible in the dga1Δlro1Δare1Δare2Δ mutant, the delivery of free sterols must occur by routes such as membrane transport or non-vesicular transport pathways. There is also evidence indicating a role for sterols and sphingolipids in the generation of lipid gradients along the secretory pathway (53Klemm R.W. Ejsing C.S. Surma M.A. Kaiser H.J. Gerl M.J. Sampaio J.L. de Robillard Q. Ferguson C. Proszynski T.J. Shevchenko A. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 185: 601-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Thus, the active production of complex sphingolipids in the dga1Δlro1Δare1Δare2Δ mutant in the absence of lipid droplets might also be required to facilitate the transport of the excess free sterols produced in the mutant from the ER to the plasma membrane by means of the membrane transport pathways.In summary, we have found that the dga1Δlro1Δare1Δare2Δ strain is not able to sustain growth in the absence of inositol at 37 °C. This is not due to a defect in INO1 expression but may be due in part to the absence of a pool of storage lipids from which to draw fatty acids as precursors to sustain optimal synthesis of PI and other membrane phospholipids in logarithmically growing yeast cells. The need for a higher proportion of newly synthesized PI in producing sphingolipids may also be a factor contributing to the growth defect experienced by the mutant in the absence of inositol. Together, these results suggest that synthesis of storage lipids"

This channel is assembled from three homologous subunits with the majority of the protein's mass found in the extracellular domains. Acid-sensing ion channel 1 (ASIC1) is homologous to ENaC, but a key functional domain is highly divergent. Here we present molecular models of the extracellular region of α ENaC based on a large data set of mutations that attenuate inhibitory peptide binding in combination with comparative modeling based on the resolved structure of ASIC1. The models successfully rationalized the data from the peptide binding screen. We engineered new mutants that had not been tested based on the models and successfully predict sites where mutations affected peptide binding. Thus, we were able to confirm the overall general fold of our structural models. Further analysis suggested that the α subunit-derived inhibitory peptide affects channel gating by constraining motions within two major domains in the extracellular region, the thumb and finger domains."

The dimer interface is not similar to that observed in vertebrates, i.e. through an anti-parallel β-sheet involving the B-chain C termini but, in contrast, is formed through an anti-parallel β-sheet involving the B-chain N termini. DILP5 binds to and activates the human insulin receptor and lowers blood glucose in rats. It also lowers trehalose levels in Drosophila.

We report here the first crystal structure of invertebrate insulins expressed from cloned cDNAs, namely two variants of DILP5, DB and C4, that differ by the absence or presence of an Asp-Phe-Arg sequence extension at the N terminus of the A-chain. The structures demonstrate a conservation of the classical insulin fold with interesting variations and an unusual dimer structure compared with other known insulins. In addition, we characterize in detail the properties of human insulin and DILP 5 binding to the human and Drosophila insulin receptors as well as to two insect insulin-binding proteins; that is, the insulin-related peptide-binding protein from Spodoptera frugiperda (sf-IBP), and the imaginal morphogenesis protein-Late 2 (IMP-L2) from D. melanogaster. Moreover, we study the sugar lowering potency of DILP5 in vivo in rats and flies. We discuss the implications of our findings in the context of the structural biology and evolution of the insulin/receptor system. The cDNA encoding dilp5 was obtained by RT-PCR from D. melanogaster (OreR) ovaries mRNA. The C4 version of DILP5 consisted of amino acids 24–51 (B-chain, B2–29) and 84–108 (A-chain, A1–25) (Uniprot code Q7KUD5), and the DB version consisted of amino acids 24–51 (B-chain, B2–29) and 87–108 (A-chain, A4–25) (Uniprot code Q7KUD5). The cDNAs were subcloned into the yeast vector pIM45. The pIM45 vector was designed to optimize the insulin expression and is similar to the pAK405 vector (19Kjeldsen T. Brandt J. Andersen A.S.

Experimental details about fermentation procedure are given in the supplemental information.

The two-chain insulin molecule was purified by reversed phase HPLC (Waters 600 system) on a C18 column using an acetonitrile gradient. The purity of the protein was estimated by analytical LC (Waters Acquity Ultra-Performance Liquid Chromatography system) on a C18 column, and the molecular weight was confirmed by mass spectrometry (Bruker Daltonics Autoflex II TOF/TOF). Finally, gel filtration was performed in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 20 mm NaCl (for crystallization experiments) or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) using a PD-10 column (GE Healthcare). Dynamic light scattering was performed using a DynaPro Titan Temperature Controlled MicroSampler (Wyatt Technology Corp., Santa Barbara, CA). All measurements were performed at 25 °C, and the data were then processed using the DYNAMICS software (Wyatt Technology Corp.). Details of proteins crystallization, data collection, and processing and refinement statistics are given in the supplemental information. Briefly, crystallization of the proteins was carried out in hanging-drop vapor-diffusion experiments by mixing 1 μl of protein (9 mg/ml) and 1 μl of reservoir solution (20% PEG 4000). Both variants C4 and DB crystallized in the same space group P43212 with cell parameters a = b = 40.45 Å, and c = 45.24 Å for DILP5-C4 and a = b = 39.79 Å, and c = 45.32 Å for DILP5-DB. The structure of DILP5-C4, which contains six cysteines, was solved by means of sulfur single wave length anomalous dipersion phasing using data collected at a wavelength of 1.5418 Å (Cu-Kα) with Sharp/Autosharp (22De La Fortelle E.

The quality of the electron density map is shown in supplemental Fig. 7. The atomic coordinates and structure factor files corresponding to DILP5-C4 (PDB code 2WFV) and DILP5-DB (PDB code 2WFU) have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank.

The insulin analogues X92 (TA8H, HB10D, and B25 Y-amide), X92DOP (TA8H, HB10D, and Des B23-B30), DOP (Des B23-B30), and H2 (TA8H, EB4H, HB10D, and TB27H) were from Novo Nordisk A/S. Dissociation assays were performed as described (27de Meyts P. Roth J. Neville Jr., D.M. Gavin 3rd, J.R. Lesniak M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The cells were then resuspended in binding buffer at the initial volume. Duplicate aliquots were diluted 40-fold in the absence or presence of 170 nm unlabeled ligand and incubated at 4, 15, and 25 °C. The cells were centrifuged, and the bound activity was counted. Duplicate aliquots of 25 μl of preincubated cell suspension were counted as the time 0. To obtain a dose-response curve for negative cooperativity, duplicate aliquots were diluted 40-fold in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled ligand for 30 min at 15 °C (28DeMeyts P. Bainco A.R. Roth J. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 1877-1888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The production of sf-IBP and IMPL2 and the binding assays are described in Sloth et al.

Briefly, sf-IBP/IMPL2 was incubated for 16 h at 4 °C with 125I-labeled TyrA19 C4 and increasing amounts of unlabeled insulin or C4. Bound counts were recovered by precipitation with 2% γ-globulin and 30% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000 and counted in a γ-counter. DNA synthesis was quantified as [3H]thymidine (Amersham Biosciences) incorporation into DNA according to Bonnesen et al. (30Bonnesen C. Nelander G.M. Hansen B.F. Jensen P. Krabbe J.S. Jensen M.B.

Glucose incorporation into the lipid phase was determined in primary rat (Sprague-Dawley) adipocytes as described before (32Schäffer L. Brissette R.E. Spetzler J.C. Pillutla R.C. Østergaard S.

U.S.A. 2003; 100: 4435-4439Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The blood glucose lowering effects of the ligands were measured using male Sprague-Dawley rats according to Schäffer et al. (32Schäffer L. Brissette R.E. Spetzler J.C. Pillutla R.C. Østergaard S. Lennick M. Brandt J. Fletcher P.W. Danielsen G.M. Hsiao K.C. Andersen A.S. Dedova O. Ribel U. Hoeg-Jensen T. Hansen P.H.

Briefly, at t = 0, human insulin and DB were injected intravenously in the tail, and blood samples were collected at different time points. Each ligand was tested in four rats, and the experiment was repeated three times. The experiments were performed as described (33Belgacem Y.H. Martin J.R. J. Neurobiol. 2006; 66: 19-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Briefly, flies at time 0 were sham-injected with PBS, and flies for collection at later times were injected with insulin diluted in PBS to a final concentration of 0.01 mg/ml into the intersegmental integument of the abdomen. Flash-frozen samples for each time point were prepared from five flies pooled together. Trehalose content was determined by estimating the glucose content of each sample before and after digestion with trehalase. Each pooled sample was homogenized in 1 ml of ice-cold buffer (0.01 m KH2PO4, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, plus protease inhibitors (CompleteMini, Roche Applied Science). Homogenates were centrifuged, and five replicates of 2.5 μl from each supernatant were assayed in a 96-well plate for glucose content using Infinity Glucose (Hexokinase) reagent (ThermoElectron). After the initial readout, porcine kidney trehalase (Sigma, T8778) at the concentration of 0.05 units/ml was added to each well. Plates were covered and incubated overnight at 37 °C, and optical density was measured at 340 nm. Both DILP variants (C4 and DB) crystallized readily in space group P43212 with one molecule in the asymmetric unit and diffracted to a resolution of 1.85 Å. Because of the high quality of the dataset and to avoid model bias, the structure of DILP5-C4 was determined by sulfur single wave length anomalous dipersion phasing using Autosharp/Sharp (22De La Fortelle E. Bricogne G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar). Both structures fold basically identically (Fig. 1, A–C). Residues B25–29 (SMFAK) of C4, B26–29 (MFAK) of DB, and A1–2 (DF) of C4 were not defined by the electron density due to flexibility and consequently were not included in the final model. DILP5 folds similarly to other proteins of the insulin family such as human insulin, human relaxin, and bombyxin II from Bombyx mori. DILP5 and human insulin share 27.8% of sequence identity. When compared with the x-ray structure of human insulin (PDB code 1MSO), the major conformational differences are found in the C-terminal region of the B-chain, which is more flexible and consequently more disordered in DILP5. DILP5 does not fold into a β-turn after the C terminus of the B-chain helix (B20–23 GERG) and consequently is in an extended conformation so that the C terminus is pointing in a different direction when compared with insulin (Fig. 1D). The N terminus of the B-chain of DILP5 exhibits a folding surprisingly comparable with the T-state of human insulin with first residues B1–5 (NSLRA) extended similarly to the N-terminal B1–6 residues of insulin (FVNQHL). Structures of DILP5 and the T-form of insulin display a root mean square deviation of 1.57 Å when superimposing 37 corresponding C-α atoms (the rest of the residues were rejected with the cut-off of 3.67 Å using the default alignment algorithm in PyMOL; Fig. 1D). DILP5 demonstrates lower sequence identity to human relaxin (PDB code 6RLX) (17.2%) compared with human insulin. Structural similarity between DILP5 and human relaxin is described by a root mean square deviation of 1.2 Å based on 26 C-α atoms (the rest of residues were rejected with the cut-off of 1.35 Å; Fig. 1E). DILP5 and bombyxin-II (PDB code 1BOM) share 20.8% sequence identity, and the structures are similar with an root mean square deviation of 1.33 Å on 31 C-α atoms (the rest of the residues were rejected with the cut-off of 1.54 Å; Fig. 1F). Thus, folding of DILP5 resembles the conformation of the T-form of insulin, relaxin, and bombyxin II. Analysis of packing contacts in DILP5 crystals indicates that DILP5, similarly to relaxin and insulin, crystallizes as a dimer formed by a crystallographic 2-fold axis. The dimerization mode for DILP5 differs from both human insulin and relaxin. In DILP5, the N termini of the B-chains (residues B1–5 NSLRA) form an anti-parallel β-sheet. The whole dimerization interface is formed by residues PheA16, B1–5 (NSLRA), ProB8, AlaB9, AspB12, and MetB13 (Fig. 2A). In comparing the DILP5 sequences from the genomes of 12 different Drosophila species (34Groenke S. Clarke D.F. Broughton S. Andrews T.D. Partridge L. PLoS Genet. 2010; 6: e1000857Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar), it appears that this interface is well conserved in the DILP5s of a closely related subgroup (Dmel, Dsec, Dsim, Dyak, and Dere) but not in the other seven species, thus, possibly representing an aggregation mechanism particular to that subgroup. In human insulin several of the equivalent residues are involved in the hexamerization interface and in insulin receptor binding site 2 (4De Meyts P. BioEssays. 2004; 26: 1351-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Analysis of protein packing using the PDBe PISA-server revealed the largest total buried accessible surface area of 1129.6 Å2 for two molecules of DILP5 (17.65% of total solvent-accessible area), indicating that DILP5 could dimerize in solution (35Krissinel E. Henrick K. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372: 774-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (6929) Google Scholar). The same analysis was performed for dimerization interfaces of human insulin and human relaxin. A buried interface area for two insulin molecules of 1252.8 Å2 (17.2% of total solvent-accessible area) was calculated. Residues mostly contributing to the dimerization are AsnA21, GlyB8, SerB9, ValB12, GluB13, TyrB16, GluB21, B23–28 (GFFYTP), and ThrB30 (Fig. 2B). For relaxin, a buried interface area for two molecules involved in dimerization was calculated to be 1442 Å2 (20.1% of total solvent-accessible area). Relaxin residues mostly involved in dimerization are SerA4, AsnA8, ArgA22, PheA23, ArgB13, ValB16, and ArgB17 (Fig. 2C). Thus, the relative size of buried interface area for DILP5 is comparable with the corresponding areas for insulin and relaxin, indicating the possibility of DILP5 dimerization in solution (see Table 1 for an overview).TABLE 1Comparison of structures of human insulin, human relaxin, and bombyxin II from B. mori to the structure of DILP5DILP5Human insulinHuman relaxinBombyxin IIPDB code2WFV1MSO6RLX1BOMSequence identity to DILP5 (%)10027.817.220.8r.m.s.d.

Upon dilution there was a trend toward a smaller hydrodynamic radius, indicating the DILPs were approaching a monomeric state. The binding of 125I human insulin to DIR is time, temperature, and pH-dependent (supplemental Fig. 1, A and B). The optimal conditions for binding were found to be 15 °C, pH 6.5, and 60 min of incubation compared with 15 °C, 150 min, and pH 7.6 for HIR. The association was only slightly faster at higher temperatures, and the maximum binding was found after 90 min incubation at 25 °C but was diminished afterward probably due to higher internalization rate compared with the lower temperatures. The equilibrium binding for all temperatures at pH 7.6 was similar, whereas it was different for the association at pH 6.5. The binding was affected by pH with a bell-shaped curve with a pH optimum at about pH 6.5, whereas the optimum for human insulin binding to HIR is pH 8.0 (36De Meyts P. Blecher M. Methods in Receptor Research. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1976: 301-383Google Scholar). The dissociation was also temperature and pH-dependent (supplemental Fig. 2) as it is for the HIR. The dissociation rates increased as the temperature was increased, 25 °C showing the fastest and 4 °C showing the slowest rate. When the pH was lowered from 7.6 to 6.5, the dissociation was markedly decreased at all temperatures examined, which was the opposite effect of what was seen for HIR (28DeMeyts P. Bainco A.R. Roth J. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 1877-1888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A clear acceleration of non-first order dissociation was seen at all temperatures and pH values in a 40-fold dilution in the presence of 170 nm unlabeled human insulin, the hallmark of negative cooperativity (27de Meyts P. Roth J. Neville Jr., D.M. Gavin 3rd, J.R. Lesniak M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1973; 55: 154-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 3A, supplemental Fig. 2). To further investigate this, we performed dose-response curves for accelerated dissociation where the amount of tracer bound after 30 min of dissociation was measured as a function of increasing concentrations of human insulin (Fig. 3C and supplemental Fig. 3). Dissociation of 125I human insulin from the HIR by human insulin produced a bell-shaped curve as previously reported (27de Meyts P. Roth J. Neville Jr., D.M. Gavin 3rd, J.R. Lesniak M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1973; 55: 154-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar) and shown in Fig. 3C. The same was seen for the DIR, with a rightward shift in the curve reflecting a reduced affinity of human insulin for the DIR Fig. 3C. A decrease in the maximal acceleration of dissociation was found when the dose-response curve for negative cooperativity was done at pH 6.5 but the curve was still bell-shaped (supplemental Fig. 3). When the dissociation of prebound 125I human insulin from DIR was carried out in the presence of 5 μm DILP5 DB or C4, a clear acceleration of dissociation was seen to the same extent as when dissociation was carried out in the presence of unlabeled human insulin (Fig. 3B). However the dose-response curve for negative cooperativity was sigmoid when the dissociation was carried out in the presence of increasing concentrations of DB or C4 in contrast to the bell-shaped dose-response curve for human insulin (Fig. 3D). To compare the binding affinity of DIR and HIR, the affinities of various ligands for DIR were determined in heterologous competition studies using a constant amount of 125I human insulin and increasing concentrations of unlabeled ligands. The average Kd value for each ligand and ±S.D. are shown in Table 2, and the curves are shown in Fig. 4. The DILP5s had the highest affinity (lowest Kd values) for the DIR. The Kd of human insulin for the DIR was 60 nm at pH 7.6, which is higher than the reported 15 nm, pH 7.9, by Petruzzelli et al. (37Petruzzelli L. Herrera R. Garcia-Arenas R. Rosen O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 16072-16075Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Kd for IGF-II was 30 nm, which is lower than 250 nm reported by Petruzzelli et al. (11Petruzzelli L. Herrera R. Garcia R. Rosen O.M. Cancer Cells. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1985: 115-122Google Scholar). The above Kd values were obtained by fitting to a single class of sites, but the competition curves for the high affinity ligands were clearly biphasic (Fig. 4, B and D).TABLE 2Competitive binding for the Drosophila insulin receptor of increasing concentrations of human insulin analogues IGFs and the DILP5s (C4 and DB) and a fixed concentration of 125I human insulinAnalogueKd ± S.D.nmHuman insulin59.6 ± 5Insulin-like growth factor-I5913 ± 3188Insulin-like growth factor -II30 ± 6.3Desoctapeptide468 ± 131X92 Desoctapeptide277 ± 47H212.3 ± 3.9X92 Kd10.19 ± 0.11X92 Kd212.3 ± 5.5C4 Kd10.76 ± 0.16C4 Kd2429 ± 125DB Kd10.35 ± 0.09DB Kd2276 ± 94 Open table in a new tab Curve-fitting of the competition experiments was done assuming that there are two independent classes of binding sites (receptor species). Using the harmonic oscillator model of insulin receptor binding (see the supplemental information and supplemental Figs. 5 and 6), one can show that this assumption is not necessary. However, the Kd of the first binding class corresponds to the apparent high affinity binding of the DILP molecule to the cross-linked receptor, and the Kd of the second binding class corresponds to the low affinity partial site of the receptor, whereas the high affinity partial site of the receptor is not “visible” in the competition plot. Thus, this method allows easy quantification of the receptor apparent high affinity binding and also of the binding to the low affinity partial site. In contrast, quantification with the harmonic oscillator model requires measurement of multiple dose-response curves for the accelerated dissociation, which was not attempted in this study. The affinities of the ligands ranked as follows: X92 > DB > C4 ≫ H2 > IGF-II > human insulin ≫ X92DOP > DOP ≫ IGF-I. 125I-C4 and DB did not show any specific binding to the human receptor on IM-9 cells. Heterologous competition studies using constant amount of 125I human insulin and increasing concentrations of unlabeled DILP5s, C4 and DB, were carried out to determine the affinities (Fig. 4E). The Kd of C4 and DB for the human receptor were much higher than that of human insulin (C4: 5336 nm, D"
https://openalex.org/W2048401333,"Protein aggregation is a hallmark of many diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) where aggregation of copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) is implicated in pathogenesis. We report here that fully metallated (holo) SOD1 under physiologically relevant solution conditions can undergo changes in metallation and/or dimerization over time and form aggregates that do not exhibit classical characteristics of amyloid. The relevance of the observed aggregation to disease is demonstrated by structural and tinctorial analyses, including the novel observation of binding of an anti-SOD1 antibody that specifically recognizes aggregates in ALS patients and mice models. ALS-associated SOD1 mutations can promote aggregation but are not essential. The SOD1 aggregation is characterized by a lag phase, which is diminished by self- or cross-seeding and by heterogeneous nucleation. We interpret these findings in terms of an expanded aggregation mechanism consistent with other in vitro and in vivo findings that point to multiple pathways for the formation of toxic aggregates by different forms of SOD1."

LKB1 is a well studied tumor suppressor kinase that regulates cell growth and polarity. Here, we analyzed the LKB1-LIP1 and the Smad4-LIP1 protein complexes and found that LIP1 can self-oligomerize. We further demonstrate that LKB1 is capable of phosphorylating Smad4 on Thr77 of its DNA-binding domain. LKB1 inhibits Smad4 from binding to either TGFβ- or bone morphogenetic protein-specific promoter sequences, which correlates with the negative regulatory effect LKB1 exerts on Smad4-dependent transcription. Accordingly, LKB1 negatively regulates TGFβ gene responses and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Thus, LKB1 and LIP1 provide negative control of TGFβ signaling.

We examined CysLT synthesis and arachidonic acid (AA) and lysophospholipid release by eosinophils mediated by recombinant human sPLA2-X. We found that recombinant sPLA2-X caused marked AA release and a rapid onset of CysLT synthesis in human eosinophils that was blocked by a selective sPLA2-X inhibitor. Exogenous sPLA2-X released lysophospholipid species that arise from phospholipids enriched in AA in eosinophils, including phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, and phosphatidylethanolamine as well as plasmenyl phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine. CysLT synthesis mediated by sPLA2-X but not AA release could be suppressed by inhibition of cPLA2α. Exogenous sPLA2-X initiated Ser505 phosphorylation of cPLA2α, an intracellular Ca2+ flux, and translocation of cPLA2α and 5-lipoxygenase in eosinophils. Synthesis of CysLTs in response to sPLA2-X or lysophosphatidylcholine was inhibited by p38 or JNK inhibitors but not by a MEK 1/2 inhibitor. A further increase in CysLT synthesis was induced by the addition of sPLA2-X to eosinophils under conditions of N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine-mediated cPLA2α activation. These results indicate that sPLA2-X participates in AA and lysophospholipid release, resulting in CysLT synthesis in eosinophils through a mechanism involving p38 and JNK MAPK, cPLA2α, and 5-lipoxygenase activation and resulting in the amplification of CysLT synthesis during cPLA2α activation.

https://openalex.org/W2011781339,"ATP hydrolysis-dependent rotation of the F(1) sector of the ATP synthase is a successive cycle of catalytic dwells (∼0.2 ms at 24 °C) and 120° rotation steps (∼0.6 ms) when observed under V(max) conditions using a low viscous drag 60-nm bead attached to the γ subunit (Sekiya, M., Nakamoto, R. K., Al-Shawi, M. K., Nakanishi-Matsui, M., and Futai, M. (2009) J. Biol. Chem. 284, 22401-22410). During the normal course of observation, the γ subunit pauses in a stochastic manner to a catalytically inhibited state that averages ∼1 s in duration. The rotation behavior with adenosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) as the substrate or at a low ATP concentration (4 μM) indicates that the rotation is inhibited at the catalytic dwell when the bound ATP undergoes reversible hydrolysis/synthesis. The temperature dependence of rotation shows that F(1) requires ∼2-fold higher activation energy for the transition from the active to the inhibited state compared with that for normal steady-state rotation during the active state. Addition of superstoichiometric ε subunit, the inhibitor of F(1)-ATPase, decreases the rotation rate and at the same time increases the duration time of the inhibited state. Arrhenius analysis shows that the ε subunit has little effect on the transition between active and inhibited states. Rather, the ε subunit confers lower activation energy of steady-state rotation. These results suggest that the ε subunit plays a role in guiding the enzyme through the proper and efficient catalytic and transport rotational pathway but does not influence the transition to the inhibited state."

The interaction of light chain LC8 with the natively disordered N-terminal domain of IC induces helix formation at distant IC sites in or near a region predicted to form a coiled-coil. This fostered the hypothesis that LC8 binding promotes IC self-association to form a coiled-coil or other interchain helical structure. However, recent studies show that the predicted coiled-coil sequence partially overlaps the light chain LC7 recognition sequence on IC, raising questions about the apparently contradictory effects of LC8 and LC7. Here, we use NMR and fluorescence quenching to localize IC self-association to residues within the predicted coiled-coil that also correspond to helix 1 of the LC7 recognition sequence. LC8 binding promotes IC self-association of helix 1 from each of two IC chains, whereas LC7 binding reverses self-association by incorporating the same residues into two symmetrical, but distant, helices of the LC7-IC complex. Isothermal titration experiments confirm the distinction of LC8 enhancement of IC self-association and LC7 binding effects.

https://openalex.org/W2057109887,"The protein kinase C (PKC)-MAPK signaling cascade is activated and is essential for viability when cells are starved for the phospholipid precursor inositol. In this study, we report that inhibiting inositol-containing sphingolipid metabolism, either by inositol starvation or treatment with agents that block sphingolipid synthesis, triggers PKC signaling independent of sphingoid base accumulation. Under these same growth conditions, a fluorescent biosensor that detects the necessary PKC signaling intermediate, phosphatidylinositol (PI)-4-phosphate (PI4P), is enriched on the plasma membrane. The appearance of the PI4P biosensor on the plasma membrane correlates with PKC activation and requires the PI 4-kinase Stt4p. Like other mutations in the PKC-MAPK pathway, mutants defective in Stt4p and the PI4P 5-kinase Mss4p, which generates phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, exhibit inositol auxotrophy, yet fully derepress INO1, encoding inositol-3-phosphate synthase.

F., King, S. A., Nygaard, E. B., Rigor, R. R., and Cala, P. M. (2007) <i>J. Biol. Chem.</i> 282, 19716–19727). Here, we present a structural model of the transmembrane part of hNHE1 that further supports this conclusion. The hNHE1 model was based on the crystal structure of the <i>Escherichia coli</i> Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter, NhaA, and previous cysteine scanning accessibility studies of hNHE1 and was validated by EPR spectroscopy of spin labels in TM IV and TM XI, as well as by functional analysis of hNHE1 mutants. Removal of all endogenous cysteines in hNHE1, introduction of the mutations A173C (TM IV) and/or I461C (TM XI), and expression of the constructs in mammalian cells resulted in functional hNHE1 proteins. The distance between these spin labels was ∼15 A, confirming that TM IV and TM XI are in close proximity. This distance was decreased both at pH 5.1 and in the presence of the NHE1 inhibitor cariporide. A similar TM IV·TM XI distance and a similar change upon a pH shift were found for the cariporide-insensitive <i>Pleuronectes americanus</i> (pa) NHE1; however, in paNHE1, cariporide had no effect on TM IV·TM XI distance. The central role of the TM IV·TM XI arrangement was confirmed by the partial loss of function upon mutation of Arg<sup>425</sup>, which the model predicts stabilizes this arrangement. The data are consistent with a role for TM IV and TM XI rearrangements coincident with ion translocation and inhibitor binding by hNHE1."
https://openalex.org/W2031006495,"Prior work indicates that IL-6 can stimulate c-Myc expression in multiple myeloma (MM) cells, which is independent of effects on transcription and due to enhanced translation mediated by an internal ribosome entry site in the 5'-UTR of the c-Myc RNA. The RNA-binding protein hnRNP A1 (A1) was also critical to IL-6-stimulated translation. Because A1 shuttles between nucleus and cytoplasm, we investigated whether the ability of IL-6 to enhance Myc translation was mediated by stimulation of A1 shuttling. In MM cell lines and primary specimens, IL-6 increased A1 cytoplasmic localization. In contrast, there was no effect on the total cellular levels of A1. Use of a dominant negative A1 construct, which prevents endogenous A1 from nucleus-to-cytoplasm transit, prevented the ability of IL-6 to enhance Myc internal ribosome entry site activity, Myc protein expression, and MM cell growth. IL-6-stimulated cytoplasmic localization was mediated by alterations in the C-terminal M9 peptide of A1, and this correlated with the ability of IL-6 to induce serine phosphorylation of this domain. A p38 kinase inhibitor prevented IL-6-induced A1 phosphorylation. Thus, IL-6 activates c-Myc translation in MM cells by inducing A1 phosphorylation and cytoplasmic localization in a p38-dependent fashion. These data suggest A1 as a potential therapeutic target in MM."

We previously showed that ribosomal stalk is required for depurination of the SRL by ricin toxin A chain (RTA). The interaction between RTA and ribosomes was characterized by a two-step binding model, where the stalk structure could be considered as an important interacting element. Here, using purified yeast ribosomal stalk complexes assembled in vivo, we show a direct interaction between RTA and the isolated stalk complex. Detailed kinetic analysis of these interactions in real time using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) indicated that there is only one type of interaction between RTA and the ribosomal stalk, which represents one of the two binding steps of the interaction with ribosomes. Interactions of RTA with the isolated stalk were relatively insensitive to salt, indicating that nonelectrostatic interactions were dominant. We compared the interaction of RTA with the full pentameric stalk complex containing two pairs of P1/P2 proteins with its interaction with the trimeric stalk complexes containing only one pair of P1/P2 and found that the rate of association of RTA with the pentamer was higher than with either trimer. These results demonstrate that the stalk is the main landing platform for RTA on the ribosome and that pentameric organization of the stalk accelerates recruitment of RTA to the ribosome for depurination. Our results suggest that multiple copies of the stalk proteins might also increase the scavenging ability of the ribosome for the translational GTPases.

RTA is thought to interact with 60S ribosomes at a site overlapping that of the elongation factors 1 and 2 (eEF1 and eEF2), and eEF2 can partially protect the ribosome from RTA damage (5.Nolan R.D.

The eEF2 and other translational GTPases (tGTPases) interact with the ribosomes at the GTPase associated center (GAC), which includes the ribosomal stalk and the SRL (9.Wahl M.C. Möller W. Curr.

The stalk is a key player in the recruitment of tGTPases and in the stimulation of factor-dependent GTP hydrolysis during translation (10.Diaconu M. Kothe U. Schlünzen F. Fischer N. Harms J.M.

Remacha M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 55: 157-193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain of the P0 protein is responsible for attachment of the stalk to the large rRNA, and the P-domain anchors the P1/P2 proteins at two separate binding sites (17.Krokowski D.

In S. cerevisiae, the P1 and P2 proteins are further subdivided into P1α and P1β and P2α and P2β, and they form two heterodimers, P1α/P2β and P1β/P2α (24.Guarinos E. Remacha M. Ballesta J.P. J. Biol.

In contrast, a heptamer is described in Archaea (26.Maki Y. Hashimoto T. Zhou M. Naganuma T. Ohta J. Nomura T. Robinson C.V. Uchiumi T. J. Biol.

It is not clear why the ribosomal stalk contains multiple copies of the dimers. It was suggested that the protein synthesis machinery may function more efficiently with multiple copies of the dimers (18.Hagiya A. Naganuma T. Maki Y. Ohta J. Tohkairin Y. Shimizu T. Nomura T.

Biol. 2010; 395: 897-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, these studies provided only a fragmentary view of the ribosome interactions because individual P proteins or short peptides were used. Our previous work, using intact ribosomes, showed that RTA interacts with the ribosomal stalk to access its substrate, the SRL in yeast, and that this interaction is important for the cytotoxicity of RTA (39.Chiou J.C. Li X.P. Remacha M. Ballesta J.P. Tumer N.E. Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 70: 1441-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The interaction of RTA with ribosomes did not follow a simple 1:1 interaction model and was characterized by a two-step binding model (40.Li X.P. Chiou J.C. Remacha M. Ballesta J.P. Tumer N.E. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 3853-3863Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). According to this model, the slower, nonspecific interactions concentrate RTA molecules on the surface of ribosomes and facilitate faster, more specific interactions with the stalk (40.Li X.P. Chiou J.C. Remacha M. Ballesta J.P. Tumer N.E. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 3853-3863Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Based on this model, we predicted that there should be only one type of interaction between RTA and the isolated stalk complex. Here, we present the binding kinetics and affinity of the interactions between RTA and the native stalk isolated from the yeast, S. cerevisiae. Our results show that RTA interacts with the isolated stalk pentamer in a simple 1:1 interaction model, consistent with our previously proposed model (40.Li X.P. Chiou J.C. Remacha M. Ballesta J.P. Tumer N.E. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 3853-3863Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We further show that the association rate of RTA with the stalk pentamer is higher than with either trimer, demonstrating that multiple copies of stalk proteins accelerate the recruitment of RTA to the ribosome for depurination. Two yeast strains, P0-TH199 (MATa; RPP0-TH199; his3Δ1; leu2Δ0; lys2Δ0; ura3Δ0), and P0-TH230 (MATa; RPP0-TH230; his3Δ1; leu2Δ0; lys2Δ0; ura3Δ0) were used in the purification of the stalk pentamer and trimer as described previously (17.Krokowski D. Boguszewska A. Abramczyk D. Liljas A. Tchórzewski M. Grankowski N. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 386-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A new strain, P0ΔH2-TH199 (MATa; RPP0Δ231–258-TH199; his3Δ1; leu2Δ0; lys2Δ0; ura3Δ0) was prepared according to the previously described protocol (17.Krokowski D. Boguszewska A. Abramczyk D. Liljas A. Tchórzewski M. Grankowski N. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 386-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In all strains, the gene encoding the ribosomal P0 protein (RPP0) had been modified to introduce a thrombin cleavage site (Fig. 1). Yeast strain P0-TH199, in which a thrombin cleavage site and a His6 peptide were inserted after Pro-199 of the P0 protein, was used to isolate the stalk pentamer TH199 (P0200–312-P1α/P2β-P1β/P2α). The yeast strain P0-TH230, in which the thrombin cleavage site plus a His6 were inserted at the position after Pro-230, was used to isolate the stalk trimer, TH230 (P0231–312-P1β/P2α). The yeast strain P0ΔH2-TH199, in which the thrombin cleavage site plus the His6 were the same as strain TH199, but the binding site for P1β/P2α on the P0 (Δ231–258) was deleted, was used to isolate the stalk trimer, TH199ΔH2 (ΔH2P0200–312-P1α/P2β). There were no significant differences in growth rates between wild type strain and the strains carrying the modified RPP0 gene under normal growth conditions. The purity of stalk complexes was verified by four different biochemical methods: size exclusion chromatography, isoelectrofocusing, native PAGE, and nondenaturing mass spectrometry (data not shown). All complexes were shown to be stable entities; in particular, TH199 represented an exceptionally stable structure (15.Grela P. Krokowski D. Gordiyenko Y. Krowarsch D. Robinson C.V. Otlewski J. Grankowski N. Tchórzewski M. Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 924-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). N-terminal His-tagged recombinant RTA was obtained from BEI Resources (Manassas, VA). The C-terminal His-tagged RTA was purified from Escherichia coli as described previously (40.Li X.P. Chiou J.C. Remacha M. Ballesta J.P. Tumer N.E. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 3853-3863Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Both proteins showed a single band on SDS-PAGE by Coomassie Blue staining and by immunoblot analysis and were active in in vitro translation inhibition and ribosome depurination assays (40.Li X.P. Chiou J.C. Remacha M. Ballesta J.P. Tumer N.E. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 3853-3863Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Protein A-agarose (20 μl) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was incubated with polyclonal rabbit anti-RTA serum (10 μl) overnight at 4 °C in 70 μl of Biacore running buffer (10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgOAc, pH 7.4, with 0.005% surfactant P20) and washed three times with running buffer. Stalk complexes (50 pmol) were mixed with 500 pmol N-His-tagged RTA in 50 μl of Biacore running buffer and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The washed protein A-agarose was added to the RTA-stalk complexes in 400 μl of final volume, and the mixture was rotated at 4 °C for 3 h. The agarose was washed three times with PBS. The proteins were eluted with 20 μl 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and 10 μl of each protein was separated by 15% SDS-PAGE. The P proteins were detected by monoclonal antibody against the C termini of all P proteins (3BH5) (41.Vilella M.D. Remacha M. Ortiz B.L. Mendez E. Ballesta J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) at a 1:4 dilution. The blot was stripped with 8 m guanidine-HCl and reprobed with monoclonal antibody against RTA (MAB 3) from BEI Resources at a 1:1000 dilution. The kinetic studies were conducted using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) with either a Biacore 3000 or a Biacore T100 (GE Healthcare). We first tried to capture the stalk complexes on activated nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) chips as the ligand because the stalk complexes contained a His-tag at the N-terminal end of truncated P0. The stalk complexes were captured on NTA chips to <5 resonance units (RU) when their concentrations were varied up to 30 nm, indicating that the activated NTA chip was not able to capture the stalk complexes efficiently. As our previous results indicated that N-His-tagged RTA or C-His tagged RTA was readily captured by the NTA chip (40.Li X.P. Chiou J.C. Remacha M. Ballesta J.P. Tumer N.E. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 3853-3863Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), we immobilized N-His or C-His tagged RTA on the NTA chip as the ligand in subsequent experiments. RTA was captured on the NTA chip in the detection channel at 1000 RU, and the same amount of His-tagged enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP), which did not interact with the isolated stalk complexes, was captured on the reference channel as the control. The purified yeast stalk pentamer or the trimer complexes were passed over the reference channel and the detection channel as the analyte, and the binding was measured in real time. When Biacore 3000 was used, multicycle kinetic analysis was performed where each sample concentration was run in a separate cycle, and the surface was regenerated between each cycle with NTA regeneration buffer and 0.3% SDS. The association was monitored for 3 min and dissociation for 5 min. In contrast, in Biacore T100, kinetic analysis can be performed using single-cycle kinetics, in which a concentration series of the analyte is injected in a single-cycle without regenerating the surface between injections. Single-cycle kinetics approach was used with a Biacore T100 by evaluating five different stalk complex concentrations in each cycle and then regenerating the surface with NTA regeneration buffer and 0.3% SDS. The association was monitored for 5 min, and the final dissociation was monitored for 10 min. Standard NTA running buffer (0.01 m HEPES, 0.15 m NaCl, 50 μm EDTA, and 0.005% surfactant P20, pH 7.4) containing different concentrations of MgOAc and KCl were used. Different flow rates were analyzed to examine mass transport limitation (supplemental Fig. S1) and a flow rate of 60 μl/min was selected for all kinetic measurements. The data presented in Table 2 was analyzed by analysis of variance using SAS software (version 9.1.3, SAS Institute, Inc.). Mean comparisons were performed using Fisher's least significant difference.TABLE 2Kinetic parameters of the interaction of RTA with the stalk pentamer and the stalk trimers using single-cycle kinetic analysisComplex stoichiometryStalk pentamer, TH199 (P0200–312-P1α/P2β-P1β/P2α)Stalk trimer, TH230 (P0231–312-P1β/P2α)Stalk trimer, TH199ΔH2 (ΔH2P0200–312-P1α/P2β)kon (m−1 s−1)(2.81 ± 0.17) × 106 aMeans corresponding to kon and KD followed by the same letter in each row are not significantly different (Fisher's least significant difference; p ≤ 0.001).

Open table in a new tab The configurations of the three different stalk complexes prepared from yeast are shown in Fig. 1. The pentameric complex, P0200–312-P1α/P2β-P1β/P2α (TH199) and the trimeric complex, P0231–312-P1β/P2α (TH230) were described previously (15.Grela P. Krokowski D. Gordiyenko Y. Krowarsch D.

To construct the third complex, ΔΗ2P0200–312-P1α/P2β (TH199ΔH2), the amino acid region corresponding to hypothetical α-helix 2 (residues 231–258), which is responsible for P1β/P2α binding, was removed (17.Krokowski D. Boguszewska A. Abramczyk D. Liljas A. Tchórzewski M. Grankowski N. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 386-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The complexes were purified to homogeneity (supplemental Figs. S2, A and B). Nondenaturing mass spectrometry showed that all complexes represented stable protein entities, and their measured masses closely corresponded to the theoretical one, indicating proper stoichiometric organization (data not shown) (15.Grela P.

To determine whether RTA interacts with the purified yeast stalk complexes, polyclonal RTA antibodies were used to coimmunoprecipitate RTA with the different stalk complexes. The RTA-stalk complexes pulled down with anti-RTA were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with monoclonal antibodies against the conserved C termini of P proteins (41.Vilella M.D. Remacha M. Ortiz B.L. Mendez E. Ballesta J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, the three different stalk complexes were each immunoprecipitated only when mixed with RTA and not when they were incubated alone. When RTA was coimmunoprecipitated with the pentamer (TH199), the intensity of the lower band, which corresponds to four different P1/P2 proteins, was less than the intensity of the upper band, which corresponds to P0, possibly because the monoclonal antibody (41.Vilella M.D. Remacha M. Ortiz B.L. Mendez E. Ballesta J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) does not recognize the C termini of all four P proteins equally well, as shown in the supplemental Fig. S2B. When the blot was stripped and probed with monoclonal anti-RTA, RTA was detected in the lanes that contained the stalk proteins (Fig. 2B), indicating that RTA interacts with the three different stalk complexes in a stable manner. To characterize the RTA and stalk complex interaction, we examined the binding kinetics of the interaction between RTA and the TH199 complex using a Biacore 3000 under the same conditions that were previously used to study the interaction of RTA with ribosomes (40.Li X.P. Chiou J.C. Remacha M. Ballesta J.P. Tumer N.E. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 3853-3863Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A, the interaction of RTA with the stalk pentamer could fit well with a simple 1:1 interaction model, indicating that only one type of interaction (AB) was observed between RTA and the stalk pentamer. Both association (kon) and dissociation (koff) rate constants were slower than the previously reported AB1 interactions thought to be specific for the stalk but faster than the stalk-nonspecific AB2 interactions between RTA and ribosomes (Table 1, 200 mm salt). To further analyze the interaction between RTA and the stalk pentamer, we increased the total salt concentration in the running buffer as we did in the RTA-ribosome interaction studies (40.Li X.P. Chiou J.C. Remacha M. Ballesta J.P. Tumer N.E. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 3853-3863Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, we found that the interaction between RTA and the stalk pentamer was not very sensitive to the salt concentration. Even in the presence of 300 or 400 mm salt (Fig. 3, B and C), the interaction fit well with the single 1:1 interaction model, indicating that monovalent ions did not exert a strong effect on the RTA-pentamer interaction. Although the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of the RTA-stalk pentamer interaction did not change much when the salt concentration was increased, the association (kon) and the dissociation (koff) rate constants decreased slightly with increasing salt concentrations (Table 1). The decrease in kon and koff with increasing salt concentrations is shown in Fig. 3D, where interaction of the stalk complex with RTA was compared at three different salt concentrations. These results indicated that the interaction of RTA with the isolated stalk pentamer is strong and is not dominated by the electrostatic interactions. In contrast, previous analyses showed that RTA-ribosome interaction is salt-dependent and sensitive to high salt concentrations (40.Li X.P. Chiou J.C. Remacha M. Ballesta J.P. Tumer N.E.

https://openalex.org/W2059604911,"CD4 is a co-receptor for binding of T cells to antigen-presenting cells and the primary receptor for the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV). CD4 exists in three different forms on the cell surface defined by the state of the domain 2 cysteine residues: an oxidized monomer, a reduced monomer, and a covalent dimer linked through the domain 2 cysteines. The disulfide-linked dimer is the preferred immune co-receptor. The form of CD4 that is preferred by HIV was examined in this study. HIV entry and envelope-mediated cell-cell fusion were tested using cells expressing comparable levels of wild-type or disulfide bond mutant CD4 in which the domain 2 cysteines were mutated to alanine. Eliminating the domain 2 disulfide bond increased entry of HIV reporter viruses and enhanced HIV envelope-mediated cell-cell fusion 2–4-fold. These observations suggest that HIV enters susceptible cells preferably through monomeric reduced CD4, whereas dimeric CD4 is the preferred receptor for binding to antigen-presenting cells. Cleavage of the domain 2 disulfide bond is possibly involved in the conformational change in CD4 associated with fusion of the HIV and cell membranes."
https://openalex.org/W2092449508,"Myeloproliferation with prominent eosinophilia is associated with rearrangements of PDGFR-A or -B. The most common rearrangement is FIP1L1-PDGFRA (FP). The majority of patients with PDGFR-rearranged myeloproliferation respond to treatment with imatinib. In contrast to BCR–ABL-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia, only few cases of imatinib resistance and mutations of the FP kinase domain have been described so far. We hypothesized that the number of critical residues mediating imatinib resistance in FP in contrast to BCR–ABL might be limited. We performed an established systematic and comprehensive in vitro resistance screen to determine the pattern and frequency of possible TKI resistance mutations in FP. We identified 27 different FP kinase domain mutations including 25 novel variants, which attenuated response to imatinib, nilotinib or sorafenib. However, the majority of these exchanges did not confer complete inhibitor resistance. At clinically achievable drug concentrations, FP/T674I predominated with imatinib, whereas with nilotinib and sorafenib, FP/D842V and the compound mutation T674I+T874I became prevalent. Our results suggest that the PDGFR kinase domain contains a limited number of residues where exchanges critically interfere with binding of and inhibition by available PDGFR kinase inhibitors at achievable concentrations, which might explain the low frequency of imatinib resistance in this patient population. In addition, these findings would help to select the appropriate second-line drug in cases of imatinib-resistant disease and may be translated to other neoplasms driven by activated forms of PDGFR-A or -B."
https://openalex.org/W2066816256,"A critical observation in sporadic cancers is that not all individuals are equally prone to developing cancer following exposure to a given environmental carcinogen. Epidemiological studies have suggested that the difference in the timing of cancer onset in response to exogenous DNA damage is likely attributable to genetic variations, such as those associated with base excision repair (BER) genes. To test this long-standing hypothesis and elucidate how a genetic variation in the BER gene flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1) results in susceptibility to environment insults and causes cancer, we established a mutant mouse model carrying a point mutation (E160D) in Fen1. We demonstrate that the E160D mutation impairs the ability of FEN1 to process DNA intermediate structures in long-patch BER using nuclear extracts or reconstituted purified BER proteins. E160D cells were more sensitive to the base-damaging agents methylnitrosourea and hydrogen peroxide, leading to DNA strand breaks, chromosomal breakage and chromosome instabilities in response these DNA insults. We further show that E160D mice are significantly more susceptible to exposure to methylnitrosourea and develop lung adenocarcinoma. Thus, our current study demonstrates that a subtle genetic variation (E160D) in BER genes (FEN1) may cause a functional deficiency in repairing base damage, such that individuals carrying the mutation or similar mutations are predisposed to chemical-induced cancer development."

However, GlcCer destined for higher GSL synthesis is transferred through the Golgi by FAPP2, which contains a C-terminal GLTP-like domain, rather than by GLTP (13D'Angelo G. Polishchuk E.

Yet, GLTP docking with vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum also appears possible as well as action as an intracellular glycolipid sensor involved in GSL homeostasis (1Brown R.E.

In the present study, our goal was to evaluate GLTP gene expression within the context of GSL metabolic homeostasis by determining if alterations in key sphingolipid metabolites trigger changes in GLTP transcription, as regulated by its previously uncharacterized GLTP gene promoter. Recently, we characterized human GLTP, a single-copy gene on chromosome 12 (12q24.11) (12Zou X. Chung T. Lin X. Malakhova M.L. Pike H.M. Brown R.E. BMC Genomics. 2008; 9: 72Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). GLTP mRNA matures via classic cis-splicing into 5-exon transcripts, a highly conserved organizational pattern in therian mammals and other vertebrates (12Zou X. Chung T. Lin X. Malakhova M.L. Pike H.M. Brown R.E. BMC Genomics. 2008; 9: 72Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The discovery of an unusually G+C-rich CpG island in the 5′-UTR of GLTP indicated possible regulation by transcriptional factors that bind to GC boxes, e.g. Sp1 (specific protein-1)/Sp3 (22Zhao C. Meng A. Dev. Growth Differ. 2005; 47: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 23Li L. Davie J.R. Ann. Anat. 2010; 192: 275-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The present study provides the first insights into human GLTP transcriptional regulation, including characterization of constitutive and basal GLTP promoter (GenBankTM accession no. GU971358) and adjacent regulatory regions. Promoter analyses using luciferase and GFP reporters as well as in vivo analyses by real-time PCR and other approaches show GLTP regulation via mechanistic participation of Sp1/Sp3 transcription factors in a manner influenced by ceramide but not by related sphingolipid metabolites. HEK 293T, HeLa, and T47D cells (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) were cultured at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in DMEM (Mediatech Inc, Herndon VA) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Innovative Research, Inc., Novi, MI). To assess human GLTP promoter regulation in response to increasing endogenous ceramide, HeLa cells were transfected with pGL3(−1150/+19) and then treated with vehicle (0.1% DMSO) or with GlcCer synthase inhibitor, d-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (PDMP; Sigma-Aldrich) at 10 μm for 24 h before measuring luciferase activity. To reduce endogenous ceramide and assess the effect on human GLTP promoter activity, HeLa cells were transfected with pGL3(−1150/+19) for 8 h before replenishing with fresh DMEM medium and treating with (dihydro)-ceramide synthase inhibitor, fumonisin B1 (FB1; Sigma-Aldrich) for 40 h at 25 μm. To elevate endogenous ceramide levels, cells were treated with PDMP for 24 h at 10 μm. To analyze the effect of C6-ceramide treatment on endogenous ceramide levels, cells were grown to ∼60% confluency and then treated with 10 μm C6-ceramide for 24 h. Endogenous ceramide levels were assessed by HPLC mass spectrometry (Lipidomics Core, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC). Total RNA was isolated from HeLa cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Transcriptional start sites were identified by FirstChoice RNA ligase-mediated rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RLM-RACE, Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX). Master-AmpTM Tth DNA polymerase and PCR enhancer (Epicenter, Madison, WI) were used for 70 °C reverse transcription. Herculase® II fusion DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla CA) supplemented with betaine (Sigma-Aldrich) was used for standard PCR amplification. Primer Ra1 and Ra2 were used for first and second round PCR amplifications (supplemental Table S1). Reaction products were separated by 1.2% agarose gel electrophoresis before cloning in pGEM-T (Promega, Madison, WI) and sequencing (Genewiz, South Plainfield, NJ). Human genomic DNA from normal blood (Promega), primer pairs Pt1/Pt2 (supplemental Table S1) designed for Homo sapiens contig. NT_009775.16 sequence, and Herculase® II fusion DNA polymerase plus betaine were used for PCR amplification of GC-rich regions within and upstream of human GLTP exon 1 (12Zou X. Chung T. Lin X.

To study promoter activity, a 1169-bp PCR fragment (Phr1/Phr2), was amplified by using pGEM-T-1491 plasmid as the template (supplemental Table S1) and then inserted into phrGFP vector (Stratagene) containing humanized recombinant GFP (hrGFP) gene and no known eukaryotic promoter or enhancer element, via BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites, to generate phrGFP(−1150/+19) plasmid. To map the human GLTP promoter, a 1350-bp fragment (amplified with primer pair PG1/PG2) and a 1169-bp fragment (PG1/PG3) were amplified (supplemental Table S1) and ligated into the promoterless Firefly luciferase reporter vector pGL3-basic (Promega) via KpnI and HindIII restriction sites, to generate pGL3(−1150/+200) and pGL3(−1150/+19) plasmids, respectively. To construct 5′ deletion mutants, fragments of 5627 bp (primer pair PL1/APL1), 5303 bp (PL2/APL1), 5207 bp (PL3/APL1), 5141 bp (PL4/APL1), 5075 bp (PL5/APL1), 5004 bp (PL6/APL1), and 4917 bp (PL7/APL1) were amplified in pGL3(−1150/+19) (supplemental Table S1). Products were purified and self-ligated to generate pGL3 plasmids with inserts (−836/+19), (−512/+19), (−416/+19), (−350/+19), (−284/+19), (−213/+19), and (−126/+19). Similarly, to construct 3′ deletion mutants, fragments of 5032 bp (primer pair Ds1/Da1), 4969 bp (Ds1/Da2), and 4928 bp (Ds1/-Da3) were amplified in pGL3(−350/+19) (supplemental Table S1). Products were purified and self-ligated to generate pGL3 plasmids with (−350/−91), (−350/−154), and (−350/−195) inserts. Deletion mutants were confirmed by sequencing (Genewiz). Mutants, generated by QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene), were verified by sequencing (Genewiz). Basal promoter (pGL3 −350/+19) was used as template for amplification. HEK 293T, HeLa, and T47D cells, grown to ∼60% confluency, were transfected with firefly luciferase construct (0.6 μg) and internal control Renilla luciferase construct, pRL-TK (20:1 ratio). Luciferase activities were measured after 48 h (Promega). pGL3-basic served as a promoterless negative control. HEK 293T cells, in six-well plates at 60% confluence, were transfected with phrGFP or phrGFP(−1150/+19) (2 μg) using ExpressfectTM (Denville Scientific, Inc., South Plainfield, NJ). After 48 h, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature and washed with PBS (pH 7.4). Nuclei were stained with 300 nm DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were imaged using an epifluorescence microscope (Leica, Mannheim, Germany). 5′-Biotin-labeled, single-strand probes were synthesized by Sigma. Double-stranded oligonucleotide probes were generated by incubating equimolar amounts of complementary oligonucleotides in STE annealing buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) for 3 min at 95 °C, slow cooling to room temperature, and storing (−20 °C). EMSA reaction mixtures were incubated in 5× binding buffer (Promega) on ice for 10 min with or without unlabeled competitor, prior to adding end-labeled oligonucleotides for 20 min on ice. For supershift assays, HeLa cell nuclear extracts (Promega) were incubated on ice for 10 min with anti-Sp1 (PEP-2) and anti-Sp3 (D-20) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) prior to addition of end-labeled oligonucleotides for 30 min on ice and electrophoresis on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels in Tris borate-EDTA buffer (0.5×) at 70 V for 30 min at 4 °C and then at 120 V for ∼60 min. Binding reactions were analyzed by transferring to Biodyne B precut modified nylon membrane (Pierce) at 350 mA for 60 min, cross-linking for 5 min using UV light (312 nm bulb), and fixing at 80 °C for 60 min before detection with biotin-labeled DNA using light-shift electrophoretic mobility shift reagent (Pierce). Antibody-protein complexes were observed as supershifted or immunodepleted complexes. Chromatin isolated from HeLa cells was used in ChIP assays performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Upstate Biotech., Lake Placid, NY). For amplification of the GLTP promoter, primer pairs CH-1/CH-2 (first round) and CH-3/CH-4 (second round) were used for nested PCR. Primer pair Ne-1/Ne-2 (first and second PCR rounds), designed to amplify +489/+707 of human GLTP exon 5, served as control lacking Sp1/Sp3 binding sites. Herculase® polymerase plus betaine, was used for PCR amplification. Cycling conditions were: 2 min at 98 °C; 25 cycles of 98 °C for 20 s, 63 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 30 s; and final extension at 72 °C for 3 min. Cells were treated with Pierce classic immunoprecipitation kit (Thermo Scientific) according to manufacturer's instructions and then were analyzed by Western blot analysis. Cells were extracted using Mammalian Cell-PE LBTM buffer (G-Biosciences, Maryland Heights, MO), separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, incubated with rabbit anti-β-actin, anti-eIF4E, anti-phospho-Ser65 4E-BP1, anti-Sp1 (PEP-2), anti-Sp3 (D-20) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-acetylated lysine (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA) or chicken multiclonal anti-GLTP (Bio-Synthesis, Lewisville, TX), followed by horseradish peroxidase conjugates of goat anti-mouse antibodies, goat anti-rabbit antibodies (Thermo Scientific), or goat anti-chicken antibodies (Aves Labs, Inc., Tigard, OR), respectively, visualized using SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Scientific), and exposed to Kodak BioMax film. Bands were imaged by scanning densitometry (Epson V700 Dual Lens System, Seiko Epson, Long Beach, CA), were quantified using Quantity One® software (Bio-Rad), and were expressed as the ratio between proteins of interest and β-actin. eIF4E translation was silenced by transfecting HeLa cells with eIF4E siRNA (Cell Signaling; 25 nm) using TransIT-siQUESTTM (Mirus, Madison, WI) and analyzing for exogenous protein expression level after 48 h. Sp1/Sp3 siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used to knockdown Sp1 or Sp3. Nonspecific siRNA served as control. HeLa cells were transfected with different plasmid constructs for 24 h and then replenished with fresh medium. C6-ceramide, C6-dihydroceramide, C8-ceramide 1-phospate, C18-sphingosine, C18-sphingosine-1-phosphate, C8-glucosylceramide, ganglioside GM1 or C12-3-sulfo-galactosylceramide (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL), dissolved in DMSO, were added to the medium to final concentrations of 5 and 10 μm. Luciferase activity was measured using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system 24 h after lipid treatment. To assess the regulatory role of acetylation, HeLa cells were transfected with pGL3(−1150/+19) and, after 24 h, treated with trichostatin A (TSA; dissolved in DMSO and added to medium to 100 ng/ml final concentration), or with C6-ceramide (10 μm) and TSA for 24 h. Luciferase activity was measured using the dual luciferase reporter assay system. Total RNA, isolated from HeLa cells using RNeasy Plus minikits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and TRIzol reagent, was reverse-transcribed with Superscript III (Invitrogen). Real-time RT-PCR was performed using TaqMan Gene Expression assays (ID Hs00829505_g1 for human GLTP gene and ID Hs99999903_m1 for the β-actin gene; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Three to six independent experiments were always performed, and the Student's t test was used to compare mean values and generate standard errors using Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA). RLM-RACE is designed to utilize only full-length, capped mRNA during amplification of cDNA, facilitating accurate identification of transcriptional start sites (TSS) (25Maruyama K. Sugano S. Gene. 1994; 138: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 26Schaefer B.C. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 227: 255-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). To identify the TSSs of human GLTP, we performed RLM-RACE PCR using mRNA from HeLa cells and GLTP-specific primers (supplemental Table S1). A single cDNA band of ∼400 bases was obtained and cloned into T vector for DNA sequencing (supplemental Fig. S1). Ten randomly selected clones revealed TSSs located 26 bases (TSS1, seven clones) and 24 bases (TSS2, three clones) from the translation initiating ATG codon of human GLTP (Fig. 1). Similar results were obtained with HEK 293T cells (data not shown), indicating that human GLTP can be transcribed from more than one start sites but that TSS1 represents the major start site. To define the human GLTP promoter, the −1150/+19 region (relative to major transcriptional start site) was inserted into promoterless phrGFP. Fig. 2A shows that cells transfected with phrGFP(−1150/+19) became fluorescent after 48 h but not when mock-transfected with empty phrGFP. Similar results were obtained in HeLa and HEK 293T cells, indicating a functional promoter in the −1150/+19 region of the human GLTP gene. Next, the basal and proximal regulatory regions of the GLTP promoter were characterized by constructing a series of luciferase reporter plasmids containing 5′ deletions of the putative (−1150/+19) promoter region and transfecting into HeLa, HEK 293T, and T47D cells along with Renilla luciferase reporter as internal control. Deletion of sequence between −1150 and −350 increased transcriptional activity by 2- to 3-fold over pGL3(−1150/+19) in the different cell lines (Fig. 2B), suggesting a negative regulatory region upstream of −350. In contrast, pGL3(−1150/+200) transcriptional activity was higher than that of pGL3(−1150/+19), consistent with a positive regulatory region between +19 and +200 (Fig. 2B). Deletion to position −350 did not significantly change the promoter activity compared with pGL3(−416/+19). Additional sequence deletion between −350 and −126 resulted in continuous, stable reduction of promoter activity (Fig. 2B), suggesting that the 225-bp region −350/−126 is the GLTP basal promoter. Further analyses, involving 3′ deletions of the putative promoter, were performed in different cell lines (Fig. 2C). Compared with pGL3(−350/+19), promoter activity for pGL3(−350/−154) decreased ∼30% in HEK 293T cells and ∼55% in T47D cells. With pGL3(−350/−195), promoter activity also decreased in HeLa (∼15%), HEK 293T (∼30%) and T47D cells (∼52%), suggesting important regulatory elements are located in the −350/−91 region. A notable characteristic of human GLTP promoter is the extremely high G+C content, which is 79.54% for −416/+19 and 76.13% for the entire CpG island. Human GLTP also contains an extremely long first intron and the 5′ and 3′ regions of the first exon are highly G+C-rich. These features raised the issue of whether human GLTP falls into a gene class regulated at the translational level (27De Benedetti A. Graff J.R. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3189-3199Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). With such mRNAs, the highly structured 5′-UTRs require eIF4E binding to the mRNA cap structure to mediate initiation of translation, thus facilitating efficient scanning and start codon recognition and enhancing translation of these mRNAs (27De Benedetti A. Graff J.R. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3189-3199Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar, 28Graff J.R. Konicek B.W. Carter J.H. Marcusson E.G. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 631-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, neither RNAi suppression of eIF4E by 3- to 4-fold nor rapamycin treatment decreased GLTP levels despite phospho-Ser65 4E-BP1 decrease, which enhances eIF4E and 4E-BP1 binding, preventing assembly into eIF4F complex and inhibiting cap-dependent translation. The results show that GLTP gene expression is not regulated by the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) signaling pathway. Bioinformatics analyses indicated that the 225-bp region (−350/−126) lacked canonical CCAAT and TATA boxes but contained consensus binding sites for various other transcription factors including Sp1/Sp3. To determine whether GC-boxes functioned as viable binding sites for Sp1 and Sp3, nuclear extracts from HeLa cells were analyzed by EMSA. As shown in Fig. 4, bound biotin-labeled probe showed several labeled bands. Binding specificity was confirmed by the significantly decreased intensity resulting from incubation with 100-fold excess of unlabeled probe and the lack of intensity change by incubation with a 100-fold excess of unlabeled mutated probes. A major, low mobility Sp1 complex was observed, which supershifted upon addition of Sp1-specific antibody (Fig. 4). Furthermore, in the presence of Sp3-specific antibody, the supershifted band became very faint, the intensity of the major complex decreased, and the lower Sp3 complex disappeared, indicating competitive binding by Sp3. When both Sp1 and Sp3 antibodies were added, the intensity of the major complex was dramatically decreased, and the lower Sp3 complex again disappeared (Fig. 4). The binding affinity hierarchy for Sp1/Sp3 was as follows: −191/−186 > −270/−265 > −219/−214 > −154/−149 based on staining density. Collectively, the EMSA analyses demonstrate that the GC-boxes located on the GLTP proximal promoter do serve as binding sites for Sp1 and Sp3. The in vivo binding status of Sp1 and Sp3 was assessed by ChIP. As shown in Fig. 5A, the human GLTP promoter was immunoprecipitated by either Sp1 or Sp3 antibody, but not by β-actin antibody. Plasmid controls as well as sheared and cross-linked input DNA served as templates for positive control bands (Fig. 5A). No signal was observed using a control primer pair specific for the GLTP exon 5 region (Fig. 5A). The results clearly show in vivo binding of Sp1/Sp3 to the proximal region of the GLTP promoter. To directly assess the effect of Sp1/Sp3 on GLTP promoter activity, siRNA was used to knock down Sp1 and Sp3 expression (Fig. 5B). Down-regulation of Sp1/Sp3 expression resulted in a 27∼35% reduction in GLTP promoter activity (Fig. 5C). Treatment with mithramycin A, a drug that binds GC-rich regions of DNA and blocks Sp1 binding (29Blume S.W. Snyder R.C. Ray R. Thomas S. Koller C.A. Miller D.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1613-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), also reduced GLTP promoter activity (Fig. 5C). Taken together, the data show regulation of human GLTP gene expression by Sp1/Sp3. The contribution of representative Sp1/Sp3 binding sites were defined by site-directed mutagenesis. Because previous EMSA indicated that the mutated oligonucleotide duplexes could not compete for transcription factor binding, we concluded these mutant probes could not bind transcription factors Sp1/Sp3. As shown in Fig. 6A, site mutation of −219/−214 had a strong negative effect on GLTP promoter activity; whereas mutations at −270/−265, −191/−186, and −154/−149 had only mild effects on promoter activity. Interestingly, in T47D cells, significantly decreased GLTP promoter activity resulted from mutation at −191/−186, but not in HeLa cells and HEK 293T cells (Fig. 6A). BLAST searches of the GLTP 5′-flanking sequence of H. sapiens and Macaca mulatta showed conservation of all four Sp1/Sp3 binding sites except for a single base substitution at the (−154/−149) binding site (Fig. 6B; M4). Thus, the −219/−214 Sp1/Sp3 binding site, but not the −270/−265, −191/−186, and −154/−149 sites, is a key regulator of human GLTP promoter activity. During the past decade, important signaling roles have emerged for nonglycosylated and glycosylated sphingolipids (15Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 139-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (2462) Google Scholar). To determine whether various glycosylated and nonglycosylated sphingolipids regulate GLTP promoter activity, HeLa cells were transfected with pGL3(−1150/+19) and then incubated with either C6-ceramide, C6-dihydroceramide, C8-ceramide 1-phosphate, C18-sphingosine, C18-sphingosine 1-phosphate, C8-glucosylceramide, ganglioside GM1, or C12-3-sulfo-galactosylceramide. Fig. 7A shows that only C6-ceramide significantly increased pGL3(−1150/+19) luciferase activity (∼20–47%). C6-ceramide treatment also resulted in the following: (i) elevated GLTP transcript levels in vivo (Fig. 7B); (ii) elevated endogenous long chain ceramide levels (Fig. 7C); (iii) mitigated decreases in GLTP promoter activity induced by Sp1/Sp3-siRNA (∼58–61%) or by mithramycin A (∼42–66%) (supplemental Fig. S2, A and B). Truncations of the GLTP promoter enabled mapping of the ceramide-response region. As shown in Fig. 8A, ceramide treatment increased the activity of pGL3(−284/+19) by ∼20%, but had no effect on pGL3(−213/+19) or pGL3(−126/+19), suggesting that the −350/−213 region contai"
https://openalex.org/W2013058445,"Processive stepping of myosin Va (myoV) has been tracked by monitoring either the tail position (center of mass) or the position of one or both heads. Here, we combine these two approaches by attaching a quantum dot to one of the motor domains and a bead to the tail. Using laser trapping and total internal reflection microscopy, the position of one head and the tail are observed simultaneously as myoV moves processively on an actin filament bundle against the resistive load of the laser trap. The head moves one step (73 ± 10 nm) for every two steps of the tail (35 ± 9 nm). One tail step occurs concurrently with quantum dot-labeled head movement, whereas the other occurs with movement of the unlabeled head, consistent with a hand-over-hand model. Load increases the probability of the motor taking a back step. The back step is triggered by the motor taking a shorter forward step (head step, 68 ± 11 nm; tail step, 32 ± 10 nm), likely one actin monomer short of its preferred binding site. During a back step, the motor reverses its hand-over-hand motion, with the leading head detaching and reattaching to one of multiple actin sites behind the trailing head. After a back step, the motor can correct its mistake and step processively forward at resistive loads <0.7 piconewton or stall or detach at higher loads. Back stepping may provide a mechanism to ensure efficient cargo delivery even when myoV encounters obstacles within the actin cytoskeletal meshwork or when other motors are attached to the same cargo."
https://openalex.org/W2063744186,"The paired box domain of PAX5 was reported to fuse with the sequence of promyelocytic leukemia (PML) to produce PAX5–PML chimeric protein in two patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In the present studies, we found, by gel shift assays, that PAX5–PML bound to a panel of PAX5-consensus sequence acts as a homodimer with reduction of its DNA-binding affinities in comparison with wild-type PAX5. In transient transfection assays using 293T and HeLa cells, and retrovirus transduction of murine hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells together with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis, PAX5–PML inhibited wild-type PAX5 target gene transcriptional activity. Studies comparing PAX5–PML with PAX5–PML(ΔCC) demonstrated that the coiled-coil (CC) protein interaction domain located within the PML moiety was required for PAX5–PML homodimer complex formation and partial transcriptional repression of genes controlled by PAX5. Fluorescent microscopic examination of transiently expressed YFP-tagged proteins in HeLa and 293T cells demonstrated that YFP–PAX5–PML and YFP–PAX5–PML(ΔCC) exhibited a diffuse granular pattern within the nucleus, similar to PAX5 but not PML. By fluorescent recovery after photobleach (FRAP), we have shown that PAX5–PML fusion protein has reduced intranuclear mobility compared with wild-type PAX5. Furthermore, the dimerization domain (CC) of PML was responsible for the reduced intranuclear mobility of PAX5–PML. These results indicate that the CC domain of PAX5–PML is important for each of the known activities of PAX5–PML fusion proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2020266343,"In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Wee1-dependent inhibitory phosphorylation of the highly conserved Cdc2/Cdk1 kinase determines the mitotic onset when cells have reached a defined size. The receptor of activated C kinase (RACK1) is a scaffolding protein strongly conserved among eukaryotes which binds to other proteins to regulate multiple processes in mammalian cells, including the modulation of cell cycle progression during G1/S transition. We have recently described that Cpc2, the fission yeast ortholog to RACK1, controls from the ribosome the activation of MAPK cascades and the cellular defense against oxidative stress by positively regulating the translation of specific genes whose products participate in the above processes. Intriguingly, mutants lacking Cpc2 display an increased cell size at division, suggesting the existence of a specific cell cycle defect at the G2/M transition. In this work we show that protein levels of Wee1 mitotic inhibitor are increased in cells devoid of Cpc2, whereas the levels of Cdr2, a Wee1 inhibitor, are down-regulated in the above mutant. On the contrary, the kinetics of G1/S transition was virtually identical both in control and Cpc2-less strains. Thus, our results suggest that in fission yeast Cpc2/RACK1 positively regulates from the ribosome the mitotic onset by modulating both the protein levels and the activity of Wee1. This novel mechanism of translational control of cell cycle progression might be conserved in higher eukaryotes.

This novel mechanism of translational control of cell cycle progression might be conserved in higher eukaryotes. Cell reproduction involves the passing through a series of events collectively known as the cell cycle, which consists of alternative stages involving DNA replication (S phase), chromosome segregation and nuclear division (mitosis), as well as cell division (cytokinesis). Entry into mitosis is induced by the activation of a cyclin B-bound Cdc2/Cdk1 kinase, which is highly conserved among eukaryotic cells (1.Nurse P. Nature. 1990; 344: 503-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2228) Google Scholar). In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the inhibitory phosphorylation at a conserved tyrosine 15 (Tyr15) in Cdc2 regulates its kinase activity that determines the mitotic onset and the start of division when the cells have reached a defined size (2.Rupes I. Trends Genet. 2002; 18: 479-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The kinase Wee1 down-regulates Cdc2 by inhibitory Tyr15 phosphorylation, which is reversed by Cdc25 phosphatase, leading to Cdc2 activation and triggering of mitotic entry (3.Russell P. Nurse P. Cell. 1987; 49: 559-567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar, 4.Gould K.L. Nurse P. Nature. 1989; 342: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar, 5.Featherstone C.

Consequently, fission yeast cells lacking Wee1 activity enter mitosis before reaching a critical size to produce two small daughter cells (7.Nurse P.

On the contrary, mutants in Cdc25 enter mitosis at an increased cell size, indicating that the activities/levels of both Cdc25 and Wee1 must be tightly regulated to provide an accurate control of the mitotic onset.

For example, in the parasite Trypanosoma brucei, TRACK (RACK1 ortholog) participates in the control of the final stages of mitosis and cytokinesis (28.Rothberg K.G. Burdette D.L. Pfannstiel J. Jetton N. Singh R. Ruben L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9781-9790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Also, genetic and biochemical approaches have shown that RACK1 negatively regulates cell cycle progression at the G1/S transition in mammalian cells by suppressing the activity of Src, a nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinase that plays a multitude of roles in cell signaling, and Src-mediated cell cycle regulators in G1, thereby promoting a delay of entry into S phase (29.Mamidipudi V.

However, fission yeast mutants lacking Cpc2 display an increased cell size at division, suggesting the existence of a specific cell cycle defect at the G2/M transition (21.McLeod M. Shor B. Caporaso A. Wang W. Chen H. Hu L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4016-4027Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In this work we have taken advantage of S. pombe as a suitable model to identify molecular mechanisms related to cell cycle, and we show that Cpc2 is a key element involved in the regulation of the mitotic onset in this organism. The S. pombe strains (Table 1) were grown with shaking at 28 °C in either YES medium or EMM2 (34.Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3148) Google Scholar) with 2% of glucose, and supplemented with adenine, leucine, histidine, or uracil (100 mg/liter, Sigma) depending on their particular requirements. In experiments performed with cdc25-22 or cdc10-129 thermosensitive mutant strains, the cells were grown in YES medium to an A600 of 0.2 at 25 °C (permissive temperature), shifted to 37 °C for 3.5 h, and released from the growth arrest by transfer back to 25 °C.TABLE 1S. pombe strains used in this studyStrainGenotypeSource/ReferenceMM1h+ade6-M216 leu1-32 ura4D-1833.Madrid M.

Cells were rehydrated in 50 mm sodium citrate, 0.1 mg/ml RNaseA, incubated at 37 °C for 2 h, and stained with 4 μg/ml propidium iodide. Cells were analyzed using a Becton Dickinson FACSort cytometer equipped with CellQuest software. This assay was performed following the protocol described by Kearsey et al. (35.Kearsey S.E. Montgomery S. Labib K. Lindner K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1681-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), with slight modifications. Briefly, the cells were recovered by centrifugation (3000 × g for 1 min) and resuspended in ZM buffer (50 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.6, 1.2 m sorbitol, 0.5 mm magnesium acetate, and 10 mm DTT) plus 2 mg/ml zymoliase 50T (Seikagaku Corporation), and permeabilized by incubation at 32 °C for 10 min. The cells were then washed twice in Stop buffer (0.1 m MES, pH 6.6, 1.2 m sorbitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm magnesium acetate) and resuspended in EB buffer (20 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 0.4 m sorbitol, 2 mm magnesium acetate, and 150 mm potassium acetate plus a specific protease inhibitor mixture obtained from Sigma). The cell suspensions were divided into two aliquots; one remained unchanged, and the other was treated with 0.02 volume of Triton X-100 for 5 min at room temperature. Afterward, the cells were recovered by centrifugation, resuspended first in methanol, then in acetone, and finally observed by fluorescence microscopy (see below). The cpc2+-null mutants were obtained by entire deletion of the corresponding coding sequence and its replacement with the KanR cassette by PCR-mediated strategy using plasmid pFA6a-KanR as template (36.Bähler J. Wu J.Q. Longtine M.S. Shah N.G. McKenzie 3rd, A. Steever A.B. Wach A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 943-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (1771) Google Scholar). Mutant strains were obtained either by transformation (lithium acetate method) (34.Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3148) Google Scholar) or by mating and diploid selection in EMM2 without supplements. Spores were purified by glusulase treatment (37.Soto T. Beltrán F.F. Paredes V. Madrid M. Millar J.B.A. Vicente-Soler J. Cansado J. Gacto M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5056-5065Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and allowed to germinate in EMM2 plus the appropriate requirements. Correct construction of strains was verified by PCR and Western blot analyses (see below). In plate assays, wild-type and mutant strains of S. pombe were grown in YES liquid medium to an A600 of 0.6. Appropriate dilutions were spotted per duplicate on YES solid plates containing 2% (w/v) Bacto Agar (Difco) and incubated at either 25, 30, 32, 34, or 37 °C for 3 days and then photographed. In all cases 30–40 ml of culture was harvested by centrifugation at 4 °C, the cells washed with cold PBS buffer, and the yeast pellets immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total cell homogenates were prepared under native conditions as described (38.Madrid M. Núñez A. Soto T. Vicente-Soler J. Gacto M. Cansado J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 4405-4419Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), employing chilled acid-washed glass beads and lysis buffer (10% glycerol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, plus specific protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures for fungal and yeast extracts, obtained from Sigma). The lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min and resolved in 6–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, depending on the relative size of the fusion protein, and transferred to filters. The following antibodies were employed in Western blotting experiments: mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody (clone 12CA5; Roche Molecular Biochemicals), rabbit polyclonal anti-Cdc2 pY15 antibody (Chemicon International), mouse monoclonal anti-GFP antibody (Roche Applied Science). A rabbit polyclonal anti-Cdk1/Cdc2 (PSTAIR) antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) was used as loading control. Immunoreactive bands were detected employing anti-mouse or anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma) and either the ECL (Amersham Biosciences) or Supersignal (Pierce) systems. Yeast cells were grown in YES medium to an A600 of 0.8, and volumes of 50 ml of the cultures were recovered. Total RNA preparations were obtained as described previously and resolved through 1.5% agarose-formaldehyde gels. Northern (RNA)-hybridization analyses were performed as reported earlier (22.Núñez A. Franco A. Madrid M. Soto T. Vicente J. Gacto M. Cansado J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 3996-4009Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The probes employed were amplified by PCR and included a 0.8-kbp fragment of the wee1+ gene that was amplified with the 5′ oligonucleotide TCTCTCCATTTGCATCGGGC and the 3′ oligonucleotide AGGAGGAGGATCGAACCTCA; a 1.5-kbp fragment of the nim1+ gene amplified with the 5′ oligonucleotide GGGACGTCTATTTTGATTGCC and the 3′ oligonucleotide ATGGTGAAGCGACACAAAAAT; a 1.2-kbp fragment of the cdr2+ gene amplified with the 5′ oligonucleotide GGACGGATTGTCGTTGACGA and the 3′ oligonucleotide AGCAGCATCCAACGGGC; and a 1-kbp fragment of the leu1+ gene amplified with the 5′ oligonucleotide TCGTCGTCTTACCAGGAG and the 3′ oligonucleotide CAACAGCCTTAGTAATAT. For DNA labeling Ready-To-Go DNA labeling beads (GE Healthcare) were used. To establish quantitative conclusions, the level of mRNAs was determined in a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) and compared with the internal control (leu1+ mRNA). To determine cell size at division the yeast strains were grown in either EMM2 or YES medium to an A600 of 0.5 and treated with Calcofluor white, which specifically stains cell wall and septum (39.Alfa C. Fantes P. Hyams J. Mcleod M. Warbrick E. Experiments with Fission Yeast. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993Google Scholar). A minimum of 200 septated cells were scored for each mutant. Binucleated cells were estimated after DAPI staining of nuclei as described previously (39.Alfa C. Fantes P. Hyams J. Mcleod M. Warbrick E. Experiments with Fission Yeast. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993Google Scholar). In the Mcm4-GFP chromatin binding assay, the Triton X-100-extracted and nonextracted cells were recovered in acetone, resuspended in TBS buffer with 2 mm CaCl2, and stained with DAPI. The percentage of cells with nuclear Mcm4-GFP in extracted versus nonextracted cells was estimated. A Leica DM 4000B fluorescence microscope equipped with a 100× objective was employed, and the images were captured with a cooled Leica DC 300F camera and IM50 software, and then imported into Adobe PhotoShop CS3 (Adobe Systems). All experiments were repeated at least three times with similar results. Representative results are shown. S. pombe mutants lacking Cpc2 increased cell size at division (Fig. 1A) (21.McLeod M. Shor B. Caporaso A. Wang W. Chen H. Hu L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4016-4027Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 22.Núñez A. Franco A. Madrid M. Soto T. Vicente J. Gacto M. Cansado J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 3996-4009Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In eukaryotic cells, Cdk1/Cdc2 kinase activity is down-regulated during G2 phase of the cell cycle by phosphorylation at Tyr15 (2.Rupes I. Trends Genet. 2002; 18: 479-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). We thus examined the levels of Cdc2 phosphorylation at Tyr15 during the cell cycle in synchronized cultures of strains PPG148 (cdc25-22) and AN-CC18 (cdc25-22 cpc2Δ) after growth at 25 °C to log phase, a shift to 37 °C for 3.5 h to arrest cells in G2, and then incubation back to 25 °C. As indicated in Fig. 1B, the lowest level of Cdc2-Tyr15 phosphorylation in cdc25-22 cpc2Δ cells showed a delayed kinetics compared with control cells (∼150 min in cdc25-22 cpc2Δ cells versus ∼90 min in control cells). The maximum percentage of binucleated (entering mitosis) and septated cells was also retarded in the cdc25-22 cpc2Δ mutant, confirming a cell cycle defect at G2. Interestingly, both the thermosensitive phenotype and the increased cell size at division were enhanced in the cdc25–22 mutant by simultaneous deletion of cpc2+ (Fig. 1, C and D). Taken together, these results suggest that in fission yeast Cpc2 positively regulates G2/M transition during the cell cycle by affecting the phosphorylation status of Cdc2 kinase. RACK1, the Cpc2 ortholog in higher eukaryotic cells, regulates cell growth by suppressing the activity of Src kinase in G1, therefore delaying entry into S phase (29.Mamidipudi V. Zhang J. Lee K.C. Cartwright C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6788-6798Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 30.Mamidipudi V. Miller L.D. Mochly-Rosen D. Cartwright C.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 352: 423-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Conversely, down-regulation of RACK1 activates Src-mediated signaling and accelerates G1/S progression (29.Mamidipudi V. Zhang J. Lee K.C. Cartwright C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6788-6798Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Although the results shown above suggest that Cpc2 regulates the length of the G2 phase during the cell cycle in fission yeast, it might also be true that it plays a role during G1/S transition. To test this possibility, we performed a set of experiments with control and cpc2Δ cells harboring a thermosensitive allele of Cdc10 (cdc10-129), which induces the transcription of several genes required for progression through G1 into S phase (40.McInerny C.J. Kersey P.J. Creanor J. Fantes P.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4761-4768Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Strains 326 (cdc10-129) and AN-CC10 (cdc10-129 cpc2Δ) were synchronized at early G1 by incubation at 37 °C for 4 h and then cultured again to 25 °C. Flow cytometry analysis of samples taken at subsequent times revealed that the rate of increase in DNA content from 1C to 2C during G1/S transition was similar in both strains (Fig. 2A), supporting that Cpc2 does not participate in the regulation of this phase of the cell cycle. We further analyzed G1/S transition by employing both control and cpc2Δ cdc10ts cells expressing a C-terminal GFP-tagged version of Mcm4, a DNA replication factor that forms part of the prereplicative complex during early S phase (35.Kearsey S.E. Montgomery S. Labib K. Lindner K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1681-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Mcm4 is an ideal tool to investigate the kinetics of G1/S transition under different situations because this factor binds stably to chromatin during anaphase B and is displaced as replication proceeds during S phase (35.Kearsey S.E. Montgomery S. Labib K. Lindner K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1681-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 41.Tvegård T. Soltani H. Skj⊘lberg H.C. Krohn M. Nilssen E.A. Kearsey S.E. Grallert B. Boye E. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 649-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2B (upper and lower), the presence of chromatin-bound Mcm4-GFP was maximal 60 min after releasing the cells from the restrictive temperature in cdc10tts control (41.Tvegård T. Soltani H. Skj⊘lberg H.C. Krohn M. Nilssen E.A. Kearsey S.E. Grallert B. Boye E. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 649-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and cdc10ts cpc2Δ cultures, decreasing thereafter. Moreover, the increase in Cdc2-Tyr15 phosphorylation during G1/S transition in cdc10ts cells was not affected by the absence of Cpc2 (Fig. 2C). As a whole, these results confirm that Cpc2 does not regulate G1/S transition during the fission yeast cell cycle. Until now, we have demonstrated that cpc2Δ mutant cells undergo a specific cell cycle delay at G2/M transition. The MAPK Sty1, which is main effector of the SAPK pathway, controls in the fission yeast the mitotic onset in at least two distinct levels: (i) by phosphorylating Plo1 (Polo kinase) at Ser402 and promoting its recruitment in the spindle pole bodies to modulate Cdc25/Wee1 control of Cdc2 activity (42.Petersen J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2009; 37: 273-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar); and (ii) by binding and phosphorylating the MAPKAP kinase-2 related protein Srk1, which controls mitotic entry through direct phosphorylation and inhibition of Cdc25 phosphatase (43.López-Avilés S.

Whereas sty1Δ cells display division at increased size as a result of a G2/M delay, mutant cells expressing a constitutively activated version of MAPK kinase Wis1 (wis1DD), which directly activates Sty1, advance mitotic commitment and divide at reduced cell size (Fig. 3A) (42.Petersen J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2009; 37: 273-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 44.Shiozaki K. Russell P. Nature. 1995; 378: 739-743Crossref Pu"
https://openalex.org/W2008204969,"Potentiators are molecules that increase the activity of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Some potentiators can also inhibit CFTR at higher concentrations. The activating binding site is thought to be located at the interface of the dimer formed by the two nucleotide-binding domains. We have hypothesized that if binding of potentiators involves titratable residues forming salt bridges, then modifications of cytosolic pH (pH(i)) would alter the binding affinity. Here, we analyzed the effect of pH(i) on CFTR activation and on the binding of genistein, a well known CFTR potentiator. We found that pH(i) does modify CFTR maximum current (I(m)) and half-activation concentration (K(d)): I(m) = 127.7, 185.5, and 231.8 μA/cm(2) and K(d) = 32.7, 56.6 and 71.9 μm at pH 6, 7.35, and 8, respectively. We also found that the genistein apparent dissociation constant for activation (K(a)) increased at alkaline pH(i), near cysteine pK (K(a) = 1.83, 1.81 and 4.99 μm at pH(i) 6, 7.35, and 8, respectively), suggesting the involvement of cysteines in the binding site. Mutations of cysteine residues predicted to be within (Cys-491) or outside (Cys-1344) the potentiator-binding site showed that Cys-491 is responsible for the sensitivity of potentiator binding to alkaline pH(i). Effects of pH(i) on inhibition by high genistein doses were also analyzed. Our results extend previous data about multiple effects of pH(i) on CFTR activity and demonstrate that binding of potentiators involves salt bridge formation with amino acids of nucleotide-binding domain 1."

The objective of our study was to verify whether initial asymptomatic lung cancers, identified by high-resolution low-dose CT (LD-CT) on a high-risk population, show genetic abnormalities that could be indicative of the early events of lung carcinogenesis. We analyzed 78 tumor samples: 21 (pilot population) from heavy smokers with asymptomatic non-screening detected early-stage lung cancers and 57 from 5203 asymptomatic heavy smoker volunteers, who underwent a LD-CT screening study. During surgical resection of the detected tumors, tissue samples were collected and short-term cultures were started for karyotype evaluation. Samples were classified according to the normal (NK) or aneuploid (AK) karyotype. The NK samples were further analyzed by the Affymetrix single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) technology. Metaphase spreads were obtained in 73.0% of the selected samples: 80.7% showed an AK. A statistically significant correlation was found between presence of vascular invasion and abnormal karyotype. A total of 10 NK samples were suitable for SNPs analysis. Subtle genomic alterations were found in eight tumors, the remaining two showing no evidence to date of chromosomal aberrations anywhere in the genome. Two common regions of amplification were identified at 5p and 8p11. Mutation analysis by direct sequencing was conducted for the K-RAS, TP53 and EGFR genes, confirming data already described for heavy smokers. We show that: (i) the majority of screening-detected tumors are aneuploid; (ii) early-stage tumors tend to harbor a less abnormal karyotype; (iii) whole genome analysis of NK tumors allows for the detection of common regions of copy number variation (such as amplifications at 5p and 8p11), highlighting genes that might be considered candidate markers of early events in lung carcinogenesis."
