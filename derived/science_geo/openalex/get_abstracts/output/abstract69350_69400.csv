https://openalex.org/W1551383822,"Injection into rabbits of radioactive ceruloplasmin from which sialic acid had been removed enzymatically resulted in a rapid disappearance of the asialoceruloplasmin from the serum and its appearance in parenchymal cells, but not in Kupffer cells, of the liver. The rapidity of this transfer was dependent upon the presence of intact galactose residues as the terminal, nonreducing sugar of the carbohydrate moiety. Intact asialoceruloplasmin, doubly labeled with tritium and 64Cu, was isolated from the liver in good yield 24 min after intravenous injection."

https://openalex.org/W2020968590,Temperatures of small leaves of many desert plants are within 3 degrees C of air temperature in contrast to the temperature of Opuntia in the same locale; this plant has a temperature 10 degrees to 16 degrees C above air temperature. Theoretical4 justification for the observation is given based on an energy budget analysis.
https://openalex.org/W1526850712,"Abstract Human peripheral lymphocytes are stimulated to change, in vitro, from a resting state to one of progressive enlargement, culminating in mitosis, by treatment with Phaseolus vulgaris phytohemagglutinin. The sedimentation characteristics and fate of rapidly synthesized RNA have been studied in this system after 20 hours of stimulation with phytohemagglutinin, a time when RNA synthesis has been accelerated but DNA synthesis has not begun. The following findings are reported. 1. RNA synthesized during any short interval was found to be largely polydisperse in sedimentation behavior, with s values predominantly greater than 28 S. This material did not serve as a macromolecular precursor to ribosomal RNA or to other discretely sedimenting RNA species. Base composition determinations, by 32P incorporation, indicated that this material was neither ribosome-like nor DNA-like, since it had a high uridylate and low adenylate content. Estimates of the half-life of the polydisperse RNA gave a range of ½ to 2 hours. 2. The sequence of events in the production of ribosomal RNA was examined in detail in the lymphocyte system and was found to be essentially similar to that reported for HeLa cells: a 45 S precursor is converted, during a period of 15 min, to 32 S and 18 S molecules. The 32 S molecule is then converted, during the next 1 to 2 hours, to the 28 S ribosomal RNA. 3. Lymphocytes were found to be relatively resistant to the effects of actinomycin D, requiring longer times of exposure, and larger doses, to produce the inhibitory effects on RNA synthesis which have been reported with other cell systems."
https://openalex.org/W2024498079,"Renal tubules of crocodiles, lizards, snakes, and turtles have intercellular spaces similar in type to those observed in the mammalian gall bladder, but different from those of mammalian renal tubules. The fluid movements across renal tubules of reptiles are correlated with the width of the tubular intercellular spaces. In the proximal tubules, where transport is always isosmotic, the spaces are open whenever the tubular epithelium is tranporting, but closed when no transport is taking place. In distal tubules, intercellular spaces are wide open when the osmolality of the urine is close to that of the blood, that is, when the fluid resorbed is almost isosmotic to the tubular fluid. The apical two-thirds of the intercellular spaces are closed when the urine is hypoosmotic. They are also closed when the tubules are not transporting, as in collapsed tubules or tubules poisoned with ouabain. Thus, as in the gall bladder, the open intercellular spaces appear to be found whenever there is fluid transport across the epithelium."
https://openalex.org/W1520705611,"The circular dichroic spectra of oxytocin and four analogues of oxytocin are presented at several pH values in the wave length interval, 220 to 320 mµ. The analogues are 2-isoleucine- and 2-glycine-oxytocin, in which the tyrosine residues in Position 2 have been replaced by isoleucine and glycine, respectively, as well as deamino-oxytocin and deamino-2-isoleucine-oxytocin, in which the α-NH2 groups of oxytocin and 2-isoleucine-oxytocin, respectively, have been replaced by hydrogen. Measurements of lysine-vasopressin are also reported. All of these compounds show positive circular dichroism bands associated with disulfide absorption near 250 mµ, corresponding to disulfide dihedral angles close to 90°. The intensity of this circular dichroism band is sharply diminished in deamino-2-isoleucine-oxytocin, and the band is only barely discernible in deamino-oxytocin. Neutralization of the amino group—when one is present— also diminishes the intensity of the band, but not as dramatically as replacement altogether by hydrogen. At longer wave lengths, near 280 mµ, oxytocin and its analogues exhibit a band which, at least in one case, can only be due to disulfide and which, in two other cases, may be contributed to by tyrosine. A large tyrosine band is also observed in oxytocin and lysine-vasopressin at shorter wave lengths, but this band is absent in deamino-oxytocin. These results are discussed in terms of interactions among residues within these peptides and of possible conformational differences among the derivatives examined."
https://openalex.org/W2064407545,Purified extract of juvenile hormone from the cecropia silkmoth prevents the transformation of larva to pupa in Galleria. The injected extract acts independently of the insect's own corpora allata. A morphological response occurs only when juvenile hormone remains in the body from the time of injection until the end of the period in which any cells are still sensitive to the hormone. The extent of the effect depends upon the age at which the larva receives the injection. The maximum effect (perfect superlarva) is produced when the extract is provided not later than in the first third of the instar.
https://openalex.org/W1482111439,"Abstract The circular dichroism of ribonuclease A, ribonuclease S, S-protein, S-peptide, and ribonuclease S' has been measured in aqueous solutions in the 215 to 300 mµ region. The circular dichroism spectra of ribonuclease A and ribonuclease S are virtually identical; that of ribonuclease S' is similar but lacks a positive peak at 240 mµ. S-protein exhibits a more negative ellipticity between 232 and 265 mµ. Upon addition of S-peptide to S-protein, the circular dichroism in this region becomes less negative. These differences are tentatively attributed to changes in the contribution of a tyrosyl residue near 240 mµ. Ribonuclease A and ribonuclease S exhibit no positive 240 mµ circular dichroism maximum in solutions below pH 2 and 3.5, respectively; this pH dependence suggests that a side chain carboxylic acid residue interaction occurs."
https://openalex.org/W1983145805,"Residues of DDT [1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane] averaging 6.44 parts per million in eggs and chicks of the carnivorous Bermuda petrel indicate widespread contamination of an oceanic food chain that is remote from applications of DDT. Reproduction by the petrel has declined during the last 10 years at the annual rate of 3.25 percent; if the decline continues, reproduction will fail completely by 1978. Concentrations of residues are similar to those in certain terrestrial carnivorous birds whose productivity is also declining. Various considerations implicate contamination by insecticides as a probable major cause of the decline."
https://openalex.org/W2022688636,"The placement of melatonin and of 5-hydroxytryptophol in the median eminence of castrated male rats is followed 5 days later by a significant decrease in pituitary stores of luteinizing hormone. Pituitary reserve of this hormone is also depleted after the implantation of melatonin, 5-hydroxytryptophol, and 5-methoxytryptophol in the reticular formation of the midbrain. It is suggested that these indole compounds, which are normally synthesized in the pineal gland, may intervene in the control of the secretion of luteinizing hormone, possibly by acting on specific receptors localized in the median eminence and in the midbrain."
https://openalex.org/W1548021696,"Partial hepatectomy of the rat leads to a 10- to 12-fold increase in the rate of liver ribosome formation. To learn about the mechanism of the increase as well as the controls that ordinarily govern hepatic ribosome synthesis, the effects of cycloheximide were studied in normal and in partially hepatectomized animals. Ribosome formation in normal animals can be only partly governed by protein synthesis since the liver contains preformed proteins that are available to make ribosomes. The rise in ribosome formation in regenerating liver, on the other hand, is totally dependent upon protein synthesis, presumably upon an enhanced rate of formation of ribosomal proteins. An unsuccessful effort was made to learn whether the greater ribosome production after partial hepatectomy depends upon an enhanced synthesis of RNA as well as of protein. A large increase in the incorporation of 14C-orotate into ribosomal precursor RNAs occurred in regenerating liver. Reason was found, however, to believe that the increased incorporation is not a valid measure of the rate of synthesis of ribosomal precursor RNA."
https://openalex.org/W1509876229,"Abstract Transferase I loses activity slowly when incubated in Tris buffer with MgCl2 and NH4Cl at 37°; when GTP is added to these incubations, the enzyme loses activity rapidly. In the presence of GTP, aminoacyl-transfer RNA protects transferase I completely against inactivation while, in the absence of the nucleotide, aminoacyl-transfer RNA protects only partly against the temperature-dependent loss of activity. All of the nucleoside diphosphates and 5'-guanylyl-methylenediphosphonate inhibit the aminoacyl transfer reaction. GDP, 5'-guanylyl-methylenediphosphonate, and to some extent UDP, which are competitive inhibitors, also catalyze the rapid nucleotide-stimulated loss of activity of transferase I. Whereas transferase I is protected against inactivation when aminoacyl-transfer RNA is incubated with 5'-guanylylmethylenediphosphonate (as with GTP), aminoacyl-transfer RNA has no effect on the GDP-stimulated loss of activity. Other nucleoside triphosphates have no significant effect on aminoacyl transfer or on the activity of transferase I. When ribosomes, transferase I, GTP, and aminoacyl-transfer RNA are incubated, the ribosomes sedimented from the reaction mixture catalyze aminoacyl transfer in the absence of added transferase I. This observation, which suggests that transferase I is bound to ribosomes, also occurs with 5'-guanylyl-methylenediphosphonate but not with GDP, ATP, or with stripped transfer RNA."
https://openalex.org/W1972593754,"Studies to elucidate the fate of 3,4-dichloropropionanilide (propanil) in rice (Oryza sativa L. var. Nato) plants have shown that the propanil molecule is cleaved and the propionic acid moiety metabolized. To ascertain the fate of the 3,4-dichloroaniline moiety of propanil, rice plants were exposed to propanil in liquid culture. The roots and shoots of treated rice plants were extracted and quantitatively assayed for four aniline-containing metabolites. One of the four metabolites proved to be 3,4-dichloroaniline, while the remaining three metabolites contained complexed 3,4-dichloroaniline. N-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-glucosylamine was identified as one of the complexes. A time-course study of the four metabolites indicated the appearance of the 3,4-dichloroaniline-containing metabolites within 6 hours. After 14 days of treatment, the complexed aniline metabolites amounted to only 10 percent of the total propanil administered to the rice plants."

This occurred despite the purification of the polyethylene glycol by passage through exchange columns. The toxic properties, which developed some time after purification, increased with time of storage of solutions of polyethylene glycol 1540 at room temperature."

https://openalex.org/W1512885383,"Abstract Gel filtration studies indicate that ribonuclease has five cupric ion-binding sites in the pH region 5.5 to 7.0. At pH 5.5, there are one strong and four weaker sites, all of which can bind both free cupric ion and the copper-monoacetate complex. At pH 7, the distribution of cupric ion among the five sites is acetate-dependent. Affinities of the different sites for cupric ions are given."
https://openalex.org/W1564341683,"Abstract A number of stable protein adducts formed by the interaction of trace amounts of a metabolite or metabolites of the carcinogenic aromatic amide, N-2-fluorenylacetamide-9-14C, with the nuclear proteins of rat liver have been isolated and purified to constant specific radioactivity with the use of gel filtration on Sephadex G-25 and of ion exchange chromatography on carboxymethyl cellulose. Certain of the nuclear proteins which bound the reactive metabolite or metabolites were characterized as the lysine-rich and the arginine-rich histones by their amino acid composition. The highest level of binding comparable to that of the previously described specific cytoplasmic protein receptor of this metabolite or metabolites was attained by a group of basic nuclear proteins which were identified as the acid-insoluble proteins previously isolated from rat liver nuclei by Laurence and Butler. Binding of the metabolite by the arginine-rich histones was 2-fold greater than that by the remaining basic nuclear proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1966801574,"After their application to sterile nutrient agar, both aldrin and dieldrin disappeared rather rapidly from the agar in glass-covered petri dishes. In most instances this disappearance was considerably retarded from agar inoculated with either fungi or bacteria. In the presence of microorganisms, aldrin was also epoxidized into dieldrin. Half of the applied aldrin volatilized from the agar during the first day of incubation; dieldrin volatilized more slowly and at a constant rate."

https://openalex.org/W1993288372,"At the outset a distinction was made between criticisms directed at the validity of tests and criticisms not affected by the validity of the tests. It was noted further that all criticisms of tests must take into consideration the type of test and the use to which the test is put. Criticisms of the validity of tests involved the following issues: (i) tests may be unfair to certain groups and individuals, including the extremely gifted, the culturally disadvantaged, and those who lack experience in taking tests; (ii) tests are not perfect predictors of subsequent performance; (iii) tests may be used in overly rigid ways; (iv) tests may not measure inherent qualities of individuals; and (v) tests may contribute to their own predictive validity by serving as self-fulfilling prophecies. Criticisms that are more or less independent of test validity included the effects of tests on (i) thinking patterns of those tested frequently; (ii) school curricula; (iii) self-image, motivation, and aspirations; (iv) groups using tests as a criterion for selection or allocation, or both; and (v) privacy. Several concluding remarks are in order: 1) This paper has focused almost entirely on criticisms of tests. However, the positive value of standardized tests should not be ignored. Here we must keep in mind what possible alternative measures would be used if standardized tests were abandoned. 2) We must begin thinking about tests in a much broader perspective- one that includes consideration of the social effects of tests as well as their validity and reliability. 3) Finally, an effort should be made to develop rational and systematic policies on the use of tests with the culturally disadvantaged, the dissemination of test results, and the problem of invasion of privacy. Such policies can be formulated only if we are willing to take a long hard look at the role we want testing to play in the society. Standardized tests currently are a cornerstone in the edifice of stratification in American society. It is up to the social scientist to conduct research that will enable policy makers in education, business and industry, and government to determine in a consistent and rational way the ultimate shape of this edifice."
https://openalex.org/W1983097551,The locomotor reactions to apparent depth made by chicks and rats were measured in situations offering physical support with and without optical information for support. Chicks avoided an optical void though it provided physical support. Rats responded indifferently to the presence or absence of optical information for support as long as physical support was available.
https://openalex.org/W1548421406,"Abstract Radioactive samples of coenzyme Q were obtained after administration of formate-14C and benzoate-1-14C (i.e. ring labeled) to rats. After reductive acetylation the hydroquinone diacetates were treated with ozone to obtain 3',6'-diacetoxy-4',5'-dimethoxy-2'-methylphenylacetic acid. The latter acid was, in turn, degraded (a) to tetramethylammonium iodide by the Zeisel reaction, and (b) to acetic acid by the Kuhn-Roth oxidation. The results of these degradations established that formate labels the two O—CH3 and the C—CH3 groups of coenzyme Q. The ingoing C—CH3 group does not displace the carboxyl group of the benzoate precursor of coenzyme Q."
