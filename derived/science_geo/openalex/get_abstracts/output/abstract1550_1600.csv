https://openalex.org/W2077563872,"In rhesus monkeys with hypothalamic lesions that abolish gonadotropic hormone release by the pituitary gland, the constant infusion of exogenous gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) fails to restore sustained gonadotropin secretion. In marked contrast, intermittent administration of the synthetic decapeptide once per hour, the physiological frequency of gonadotropin release in the monkeys, reestablishes pituitary gonadotropin secretion. This phenomenon is attributable to the pattern of GnRH delivery rather than to the amounts of this hormone to which the cells of the pituitary are exposed. Moreover, the initiation of continuous GnRH administration in animals with lesions and in which gonadotropin secretion is reestablished by intermittent GnRH replacement can result in a ""desensitization"" or ""down regulation"" of the processes responsible for gonadotropin release."
https://openalex.org/W1963552271,"Under depolarizing voltage clamp of Paramecium an inward calcium current developed and subsequently relaxed within 10 milliseconds. The relaxation was substantially slowed when most of the extracellular calcium was replaced by either strontium or barium. Evidence is presented that the relaxation is not accounted for by a drop in electromotive force acting on calcium, or by activation of a delayed potassium current. Relaxation of the current must, therefore, result from an inactivation of the calcium channel. This inactivation persisted after a pulse, as manifested by a reduced calcium current during subsequent depolarization. Inactivation was retarded by procedures that reduce net entry of calcium, and was independent of membrane potential. The calcium channel undergoes inactivation as a consequence of calcium entry during depolarization. In this respect, inactivation of the calcium channel departs qualitatively from the behavior described in the Hodgkin-Huxley model of the sodium channel."
https://openalex.org/W1981187528,"The experiments identify some of the processes underlying arm movements in rhesus monkeys. Three monkeys were trained to point to a target with the hand and forearm and to hold that position for about 1 second to obtain a reward. Forearm movements were performed without sight of the arm before and after bilateral dorsal rhizotomy. In both intact and deafferented animals, we unexpectedly displaced the forearm prior to movement initiation and observed that the arm moved accurately to the target. These results are relevant to the question of what is being controlled by motor commands. The controlled variable appears to be an equilibrium point between agonist and antagonist muscles. The findings suggest that the feedback system plays a major role in updating and adjusting the central programs subserving the execution of learned motor patterns."
https://openalex.org/W1505957065,"A high molecular weight glycoprotein consisting of three disulfide-linked 142,000 molecular weight chains has been isolated from human blood platelets. The glycoprotein, designated thrombospondin, is released by platelets in response to thrombin treatment and is proteolyzed when left in the presence of platelets after liberation. It is relatively insensitive to degradation by thrombin. Thrombospondin is a filamentous protein of dimensions approximately 7 X 70 nm and contains 1.9% neutral sugars, 1.4% amino sugars, 0.7% sialic acid, and no hexuronic acid. Amino acid analysis reveals that the level of cysteine is approximately 260 residues per molecule. Thrombospondin binds to immobilized heparin but is released by 0.45 M sodium chloride. A single band is obtained by isoelectric focusing, indicating a pI of 4.7 as well as a relatively high degree of purity. Degradation of the intact molecule with trypsin yields a stable core particle of molecular weight 210,000 comprised of three 70,000 chains."
https://openalex.org/W2014140030,"Five Japanese macaques and five other Old World monkeys were trained to discriminate among field-recorded Japanese macaque vocalizations. One task required discrimination of a communicatively relevant acoustic feature (""peak""), and a second required discrimination of an orthogonal feature of the same vocalizations (""pitch""). The Japanese animals more proficiently discriminated the peak feature when stimuli were presented to the right ear (primarily left cerebral hemisphere), as opposed to the left ear (primarily right hemisphere). In discriminating the pitch feature, the Japanese animals either showed (i) a left-ear processing advantage or (ii) no ear advantage. The comparison animals, with one exception, showed no ear advantage in processing either feature of the vocalizations. The results suggest that Japanese macaques engage left-hemisphere processors for the analysis of communicatively significant sounds that are analogous to the lateralized mechanisms used by humans listening to speech."

https://openalex.org/W3209588409,"Three important aspects of immunoglobulin gene organization and structure have emerged from studies of cloned immunoglobulin kappa chain genes. (i) Multiple variable genes are encoded separately in the genome of both immunoglobulin-producing and uncommitted (embryonic) cells, thereby establishing the evolutionary base for generating immunoglobulin diversity. (ii) These genes exist as many small, closely related families (subgroups) that share close sequence homology largely within their own subgroup. (iii) Comparison of two cloned variable gene segments derived from a single subgroup reveals a feature of their structure that distinguishes them from fixed genes (that is, globin genes) and provides, through extensive surrounding sequence homology, a large target for intergenic recombination. This last observation suggests that a simple recombination mechanism may account for their genetic instability in both germ line and somatic cells."

https://openalex.org/W2073004668,"Three synthetic oligonucleotides were prepared to be complementary to known regions of the mouse immunoglobulin light chain mRNA, and their ability to prime the transcription of complementary DNA (cDNA) was studied. The sequence of the cDNA was determined by adapting for mRNA the DNA sequencing method of Sanger et al., 1977 Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. DNA sequencing with chain terminating inhibitors. in: Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA. 74. 1977: 5463-5467 Google Scholar which uses 2′3′ dideoxyribonucleotides. A continuous sequence of 532 nucleotides was obtained, 321 corresponding to the whole of the constant region of the mRNA and the remaining 211 being the complete 3′ noncoding region of the mRNA. The termination codon U-A-G occurs at the expected position in the mRNA corresponding to the triplet following the C terminal cystine. The nucleotide sequence is partially corroborated by the sequence of fragments obtained previously from 32P-mRNA fingerprints and endonuclease IV digests of 32P-cDNA, and is in agreement with the amino acid sequence of the constant region, except for a rearrangement of four amino acids (between amino acid positions 163 and 166). A revision of the amino acid sequence confirms the nucleic acid sequence."

https://openalex.org/W1524448000,"A procedure is described for the preparation of stable phycobilisomes from the unicellular cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. 6301 (also known as Anacystis nidulans). Excitation of the phycocyanin in these particles at 580 nm leads to maximum fluorescence emission, from allophycocyanin and allophycocyanin B, at 673 nm. Electron microscopy shows that the phycobilisomes are clusters of rods. The rods are made up of stacks of discs which exhibit the dimensions of short stacks made up primarily of phycocyanin (Eiserling, F. A., and Glazer, A. N. (1974) J. Ultrastruct. Res. 47, 16-25). Loss of the clusters, by dissociation into rods under suitable conditions, is associated with loss of energy transfer as shown by a shift in fluorescence emission maximum to 652 nm. Synechococcus sp. 6301 phycobilisomes were shown to contain five nonpigmented polypeptides in addition to the colored subunits (which carry the covalently bound tetrapyrrole prosthetic groups) of the phycobiliproteins. Evidence is presented to demonstrate that these colorless polypeptides are genuine components of the phycobilisome. The nonpigmented polypeptides represent approximately 12% of the protein of the phycobilisomes; phycocyanin, approximately 75%, and allophycocyanin, approximately 12%. Spectroscopic studies that phycocyanin is in the hexamer form, (alpha beta)6, in intact phycobilisomes, and that the circular dichroism and absorbance of this aggregate are little affected by incorporation into the phycobilisome structure."

https://openalex.org/W2056957730,"Owl monkeys (Aotus trivirgatus griseimembra) were effectively immunized against a human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. Two injections of antigen, primarily mature segmenters with fully developed merozoites, mixed with adjuvant (6-O-stearoyl-N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine and liposomes) were administered intramuscularly at a 4-week interval. Approximately 2 weeks after the second vaccination, the monkeys were challenged with the homologous strain of P. falciparum. All immunized monkeys survived the challenge. The substitution of Freund's complete adjuvant is an encouraging step toward the development of an effective and safe vaccine for human malaria."

https://openalex.org/W2141129301,"When the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in one hemisphere of a rhesus monkey is resected 6 weeks before birth and the fetus survives to postnatal ages, neurons of the corresponding cortex in the intact hemisphere issue a greatly expanded projection to the contralateral caudate nucleus in addition to a normal projection to the ipsilateral caudate. The enhancement of the crossed prefronto-caudate pathway after prenatal neurosurgery provides direct evidence for lesion-induced neuronal rearrangement in the primate telencephalon."
https://openalex.org/W2021367613,"Nesting success of ospreys (Pandion haliaetus) breeding in the Connecticut--Long Island area has increased since 1973 and is now approaching the levels recorded prior to the 1950's. Simultaneously, DDE and dieldrin residues have declined in unhatched eggs. Levels of polychorinated biphenyls have shown no changes over the period 1969 to 1976. The increase in productivity is attributed primarily to lower levels of DDE contamination. Detrimental effects in the past on ospreys in the Connecticut River estuary are attributed to local contamination with dieldrin."
https://openalex.org/W2014747284,"The substantia gelatinosa of the mammalian spinal cord is generally believed to be a closed system; that is, its neurons are thought to project only to the substantia gelatinosa of the same or the contralateral side. Experiments in monkeys, using injections of the marker enzyme horseradish peroxidase, show that at least some neurons of the substantia gelatinosa project to the thalamus and thus belong to the spinothalamic tract. Such neurons include two cell types intrinsic to the gelatinosa, the central cells and the limitrophe cells of Cajal."

https://openalex.org/W1583126439,"A slow migrating monosialosyl ganglioside with blood group H activity was isolated from human erythrocyte membranes and identified as monosialosylceramide decasaccharide. Its structure was determined by degradation with exo- and endoglycosidases, by mass spectrometric characterization of a nonasaccharide liberated by endo-beta-galactosidase, and by methylation analysis and mass spectrometry of permethylated glycolipids before and after enzymatic degradation. The ganglioside contains two oligosaccharide chains branched through GlcNAcbeta1 leads to 6(GlcNAcbeta1 leads to 3) Gal structure, and the terminal Gal of the 1 leads to 6-linked oligosaccharide was fucosylated, whereas that of the 1 leads to 3-linked oligosaccharide was sialosylated as seen below."
https://openalex.org/W1526076455,"Human factor VIII/von Willebrand factor protein containing 120 +/- 12 nmol of sialic acid and 135 +/- 13 nmol of galactose/mg of protein was digested with neuraminidase. The affinity of native factor VIII/von Willebrand factor and its asialo form for the hepatic lectin that specifically binds asialoglycoproteins was assessed from in vitro binding experiments. Native factor VIII/von Willebrand factor exhibited negligible affinity while binding of the asialo derivative was comparable to that observed for asialo-alpha1-acid glycoprotein. Incubation of asialo-factor VIII/von Willebrand factor with Streptococcus pneumoniae beta-galactosidase removed only 62% of the galactose but abolished binding to the purified hepatic lectin. When the asialo derivative was incubated with purified beta-D-galactoside alpha2 leads to 6 sialyltransferase and CMP-[14C]NeuAc, only 61% of the galactose incorporated [14C]NeuAc. From the known specificites of these enzymes, it is concluded that galactose residues important in lectin binding are present in a terminal Gal/beta1 leads to 4GlcNAc sequence on asialo-factor VIII/von Willebrand factor. The relative ristocetin-induced platelet aggregating activity of native, asialo-, and agalacto-factor VIII/von Willebrand factor was 100:38:12, respectively, while procoagulant activity was 100:100:103."
https://openalex.org/W2020296929,"The yeast Kluyveromyces lactis synthesizes a beta-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.32) which is inducible by lactose. We have isolated the gene that codes for this enzyme using recombinant DNA techniques. K. lactis DNA was partially digested with the restriction endonuclease Eco R1 and joined to Eco R1-digested pBR322 plasmid DNA using DNA ligase. ligase. A lac-mutant of Escherichia coli lacking the structural gene for beta-galactosidase was transformed with ligated DNA. Three lac+ transformants containing recombinant plasmids were selected. Two of the plasmids (pK15 and pK17) contain four Eco R1-K. lactis DNA fragments having molecular weights of 2.2, 1.4, 0.55 and 0.5 x 10(6) daltons. The other plasmid (pK16) lacks the smallest fragment. E. coli carrying any of these plasmids produce beta-galactosidase activity that has a sedimentation coefficient and immunological determinants that are nearly identical to K. lactis beta-galactosidase and distinctly different from E. coli beta-galactosidase. DNA-DNA hybridization studies show that the four Eco R1 fragments in pK15 hybridize to K. lactis but not to E. coli DNA."

This remodeling involves the death of an entire population of neurons that received synapses from sensory afferent axons and the possible relocation of these afferents upon subsequently generated viable substantia gelatinosa neurons.
https://openalex.org/W2052597175,"A method for purifying sequences adjacent to satellite DNA in the heterochromatin of D. melanogaster is described. A cloned DNA segment containing part of a copia gene adjacent to 1.688 g/cm3 satellite DNA has been isolated. The copia genes compose a repeated gene family which codes for abundant cytoplasmic poly(A)-containing RNA ( Young and Hogness, 1977 Young M.W. Hogness D.S.

We have identified two major poly(A)-containing RNA species [5.2 and 2.1 kilobases (kb)] produced by the copia gene family. The cloned segment contains copia sequences homologous to the 5′ end of RNA within 0.65 kb of the 1.688 satellite DNA sequences. Seven different cloned copia genes from elsewhere in the genome have also been isolated, and a 5.2 kb region present in five of the clones was identified as copia by heteroduplex analysis. In addition, three unusual copies of copia were found: a “partial” copy of the gene (3.7 kb) which has one endpoint in common with the 5.2 kb unit; a copia gene flanked on one side by a 1.6 kb sequence and on the other by the same 1.6 kb sequence in the inverted orientation; and a copia gene flanked only on one side by the same sequence."

The reasons for these changes are not clear. The changes in optical transmission may be useful in the study of photoreceptor function. However, the study of photoreceptor functions through the use of indicator dyes may be confounded by the intrinsic light-induced changes of optical properties of the photoreceptor cells."

https://openalex.org/W54118844,"A reconstituted heme oxygenase system which was composed of a purified heme oxygenase from pig spleen microsomes and a partially purified NADPH-cytochrome c reductase from pig liver microsomes could not catalyze the conversion of cobaltic protoporphyrin IX (Co-heme) to biliverdin, although Co-heme could bind with the heme oxygenase protein to form a complex. The heme oxygenase system in the microsomes from pig spleen, rat spleen, and rat kidney also failed to oxidize Co-heme to biliverdin. Properties of the complex of Co-heme and heme oxygenase closely resembled those of cobalt myoglobin and cobalt hemoglobin; the Co-heme bound to the heme oxygenase protein did not react with cyanide and azide, the Co-heme moiety was reduced but only slowly with sodium dithionite, and the reduced form of the Co-heme did not appear to bind carbon monoxide. The co-heme bound to heme oxygenase was not reduced with the NADPH-cytochrome c reductase system in air. These findings further support the views that heme oxygenase may have a heme-binding crevice similar to those of myoglobin and hemoglobin and that reduction of heme is the prerequisite for the oxidative degradation of heme in the heme oxygenase reaction."

https://openalex.org/W1583583144,"The three-dimensional structure of carbonic anhydrase is a result of specific folding of the protein chain to form a compact, globular molecule. Fluorescence measurements on the nature of the rate-limiting steps in folding from the random coil to the native structure show that each step involves an actual folding reaction of the protein chain. Emission intensity and polarization of the intrinsic fluorescence due to tryptophan residues reach a maximum during the early period of the folding process. The changes occur in at least three kinetic phases (tau1 less than 3 S, tau2 = 1 min, tau3 = 10 min, 1 M guanidinium chloride, 2 M NaC1, pH 7, 20 degrees C). None of these phases are explained by configurational changes in the fully unfolded chain. The results are consistent with a kinetic scheme that involves stepwise acquisition of the specific folded structure of the native enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W2132911240,"The topography of an entire redundant locus was analyzed by both genetic and molecular means. Three mutants (min0, min1, min2) allelic to the 5S rRNA genetic locus on chromosome 2 of D. melanogaster were isolated. Flies exhibit a mutant phenotype when hemizygous for a min allele, but flies having two doses are wild-type. Saturation hybridization experiments show that the alleles are gross defieciencies each deleting an equal amount of 5S DNA. Each of the three mutant min alleles produces a distinct temperature-sensitive viability phene, and thus they are suggested to be pseudoalleles within the same redundant locus. Using the segmental aneuploid method (Lindsley et al., 1972), the 5S gene cluster was subdivided into proximal and distal halves. Both saturation hybridization experiments and genetic tests show that each half contains about eighty 5S genes. The complementation of the min alleles with the proximal and distal halves of the cluster indicates that both halves function independently. We present evidence which supports the model that all of the 160 5S genes are arranged as a single continuous cluster of tandem repeats with no large interdispersive DNA segments not complementary to 5S rRNA."

https://openalex.org/W1569871546,"Abstract Intact cells of Bacillus cereus catalyze the breakdown of exogenous AMP to hypoxanthine and ribose 1-phosphate through the successive action of 5'-nucleotidase, adenosine deaminase, and inosine phosphorylase. Inosine hydrolase was not detectable, even in crude extracts. Inosine phosphorylase causes a translocation of the ribose moiety (as ribose 1-phosphate) inside the cell, while hypoxanthine remains external. Even though the equilibrium of the phosphorolytic reaction favors nucleoside synthesis, exogenous inosine (as well as adenosine and AMP) is almost quantitatively transformed into external hypoxanthine, since ribose 1-phosphate is readily metabolized inside the cell. Most likely, the translocated ribose 1-phosphate enters the sugar phosphate shunt, via its prior conversion into ribose 5-phosphate, thus supplying the energy required for the subsequent uptake of hypoxanthine in B. cereus."

It requires no divalent cations and is insensitive to EDTA; it has no associated exonuclease. These properties are very similar to those of Escherichia coli endonuclease IV, which is also insensitive to EDTA and has no exonuclease activity, and very different from those of the main endonuclease for apurinic sites (endonuclease IV) of the same bacterium."
https://openalex.org/W1564216773,"Twenty-nine oligonucleotides, 11 to 26 nucleotides in length, arising by complete RNase T1 digestion of bacteriophage Qbeta RNA and isolated by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, were sequenced. Their location within the genome was established with two methods. (a) In vitro synthesis of Qbeta RNA plus strands was started synchronously, using minus strands as template and nucleoside [alpha-32P]triphosphates as substrate; after various times, the reaction was stopped and the length of the products formed was correlated with their content of T1 oligonucleotides. (b) Qbeta [32P]RNA was elongated with poly(A) using terminal riboadenylate transferase; after mild treatment with alkali the fragments were fractionated by size and the poly(A)-containing molecules of each size class were isolated by chromatography on poly(U)-Sephadex and assayed for T1 oligonucleotides. The oligonucleotides in the 5' region were localized more precisely with method a, those near the 3' end with method b; in the middle region, the results of the two sets of analyses confirmed each other. The use of these oligonucleotides in the sequence determination of Qbeta RNA is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1511318294,"The DNA polymerase induced by Bacillus subtilis bacteriophage PBS2 (whose DNA contains uracil instead of thymine) has been purified and characterized for its specificity. The enzyme requires a high ionic strength for optimal stability and activity and is sensitive to various anions and to sulfhdryl reagents. Both dUTP and dTTP are incorporated efficiently as substrates and are competitive inhibitors at the same active site. The apparent Km and Ki values are about 6 micrometers for dTTP and 15 micrometers for dUTP, when denatured, uracil-containing B. subtilis or salmon sperm DNA (3.9 micrometers for dUTP and 2.6 micrometers for dTTP). The PBS2 enzyme works best on denatured DNA, on double-stranded DNA activated by DNase to produce gaps, or on primed homopolymeric DNA. Using denatured DNA preparations of average molecular weight 6.2 million, the apparent Km values are 270 micrograms/ml for B. subtilis DNA and 360 micrograms/ml for PBS2 DNA; the Vmax value for denatured PBS2 DNA containing uracil is 7-fold greater than that for denatured B. subtilis DNA containing thymine. However, lower molecular weight DNAs have 10-fold lower apparent Km values and show similar Vmax values for both B. subtilis and PBS2 DNAs. Thus, the PBS2 phage-induced DNA polymerase (which likely replicates only uracil-containing phage DNA using dUTP in vivo) has little selectivity for uracil- versus thymine-containing deoxyribonucleotides or DNA in vitro."

The polypeptide bands observed on gel electrophoresis in dodecyl sulfate have apparent molecular weights of 78,000 and 69,000 (and possibly another 27,000) in equimolar amounts. In buffers of low ionic strength, the enzyme appears to form large aggregates and even precipitates, with about 90% loss of activity. A nuclease activity co-purifies with the PBS2 DNA polymerase and shows similar responses to changes in pH, MgCl2, N-ethylmaleimide, temperature, and dextran sulfate levels. The nuclease produces deoxyribonucleoside 5'monophosphates from denatured DNA containing thymine or uracil. No endonuclease activity is detectable on supercoiled DNA. The inhibition of nuclease activity by added deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates, the DNA-dependent turnover of triphosphates, to free monophosphates during DNA polymerization, the inhibition of nuclease activity by 3'-phosphates on the DNA template-primer, and the pattern of digestion of 5'-[32P]phosphate-labeled DNA all indicate that the PBS2 DNA polymerase-associated hydrolytic activity is a 3' leads to 5'-exonuclease."
https://openalex.org/W1536514774,"Abstract A method for the isolation of RNA fragments originating from defined regions of bacteriophage Qbeta RNA minus strands is described. Large RNase T1 oligonucleotides were isolated on a preparative scale from Qbeta RNA. The nucleotide sequences (13 to 26 nucleotides) and map positions of these oligonucleotides were known from previous work (Billeter, M. A. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 8381-8389). After addition of AMP residues (50 in the average) using terminal adenylate transferase, these pure oligonucleotides were hybridized to 32P-labeled Qbeta RNA minus strands synthesized in vitro. Fragments in the size range of 100 to 500 nucleotides were then generated by partial digestion with RNase T1. Fragments hybridized to such oligonucleotides were recovered by chromatography on poly(U)-Sephadex and then resolved according to their size by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The specificity and reproducibility of the method as well as its suitability for the sequence analysis of Qbeta RNA was verified by using in particular a linker oligonucleotide derived from a Qbeta RNA region near the 3' end. The sequence catalogues of the RNase T1 and RNase A oligonucleotides of two fragments isolated in this way, 202 and 310 nucleotides in length, were established and all fragments isolated were shown to contain a sequence complementary to the linker oligonucleotide."
