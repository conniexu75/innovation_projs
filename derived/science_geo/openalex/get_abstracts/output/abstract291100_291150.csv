https://openalex.org/W2150508097,"To examine the problem of how far coral larvae disperse from their natal reef, coral recruitment densities were experimentally determined at distances up to 5 kilometers from a small, relatively isolated platform reef, Helix Reef, on the central Great Barrier Reef for 7 months. High concentrations of recruits, accounting for up to 40 percent of all recruitment, were found downstream of the reef in areas of high water residence time, suggesting that near-field(proximal) circulation has a profound influence on dispersal and recruitment of coral larvae. Coral recruitment declined logarithmically with distance from the reef, decreasing by an order of magnitude at radial distances of only 600 to 1200 meters. On an ecological time scale, advective dispersal of semipassive marine larvae with relatively short planktonic lives(minimally days) may be extensive, but success of recruitment is highly limited. Through evolutionary time, sufficient dispersal occurs to ensure gene flow to reef tracts hundreds or possibly thousands of kilometers apart. In the short term, however, coral reefs appear to be primarily self-seeded with respect to coral larvae."
https://openalex.org/W2054128768,"Continuous measurement of heat dissipation from brine shrimp embryos during reversible transitions from aerobic development to anaerobic dormancy demonstrates a primary role for intracellular pH (pHi) in this metabolic switching. Artificially elevating the depressed pHi during anoxia by adding ammonia markedly reactivates metabolism, as judged by increases in heat dissipation, trehalose catabolism, and the ratio of adenosine triphosphate to adenosine diphosphate. Energy flow during anaerobic dormancy is suppressed to 2.4 percent of aerobic values, which is the lowest percentage thus far reported for euryoxic animals. Use of diguanosine tetraphosphate stores cannot account for this observed heat dissipation. Thus, mobilizing trace amounts of trehalose may explain the energy metabolism during quiescence."
https://openalex.org/W2090332080,"The Whittier Narrows earthquake sequence (local magnitude, M(L) = 5.9), which caused over $358-million damage, indicates that assessments of earthquake hazards in the Los Angeles metropolitan area may be underestimated. The sequence ruptured a previously unidentified thrust fault that may be part of a large system of thrust faults that extends across the entire east-west length of the northern margin of the Los Angeles basin. Peak horizontal accelerations from the main shock, which were measured at ground level and in structures, were as high as 0.6g (where g is the acceleration of gravity at sea level) within 50 kilometers of the epicenter. The distribution of the modified Mercalli intensity VII reflects a broad north-south elongated zone of damage that is approximately centered on the main shock epicenter."
https://openalex.org/W2024371571,"Gases trapped in Miocene to Upper Cretaceous amber were released by gently crushing the amber under vacuum and were analyzed by quadrupole mass spectrometry. After discounting the possibility that the major gases N2, O2, and CO2 underwent appreciable diffusion and diagenetic exchange with their surroundings or reaction with the amber, it has been concluded that in primary bubbles (gas released during initial breakage) these gases represent mainly original ancient air modified by the aerobic respiration of microorganisms. Values of N2/(CO2 + O2) for each time period give consistent results despite varying O2/CO2 ratios that presumably were due to varying degrees of respiration. This allows calculation of original oxygen concentrations, which, on the basis of these preliminary results, appear to have changed from greater than 30 percent O2 during one part of the Late Cretaceous (between 75 and 95 million years ago) to 21 percent during the Eocene-Oligocene and for present-day samples, with possibly lower values during the Oligocene-Early Miocene. Variable O2 levels over time in general confirm theoretical isotope-mass balance calculations and suggest that the atmosphere has evolved over Phanerozoic time."

The enormous computer resources required by quantum chromodynamic calculations have inspired the design and construction of very powerful, highly parallel, dedicated computers optimized for this work. This article gives a brief description of the numerical structure and current status of these large-scale lattice gauge theory calculations, with emphasis on the computational demands they make. The architecture, present state, and potential of these special-purpose supercomputers is described. It is argued that a numerical solution of low energy quantum chromodynamics may well be achieved by these machines."

This year's models feature increasing automation, particularly for aspects of sample presentation. The 1988 generation of so-called hyphenated systems emphasize a combination of techniques within the same work station—gas chromatography to detect and separate organic contaminants combined with mass spectrometry to identify them, for example. And in keeping with strict environmental standards, many companies are stressing the ability of their latest instruments to detect levels of environmental pollutants in the parts per billion, rather than parts per million, range."
