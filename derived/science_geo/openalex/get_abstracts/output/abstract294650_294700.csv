https://openalex.org/W2035217074,"Meteorologists and climatologists have produced significant new data on the fluid dynamics of the atmosphere, thus allowing biologists to examine more closely the cause-effect relation between the large-scale structure of the atmosphere and the dominant patterns of global biogeography. The inability to characterize the high-frequency variability of the weather has constrained such efforts. A method that allows year-to-year patterns of weather variability to be characterized in the contexts of global warming and cooling trends is applied in a combined analysis of long-term monthly weather records and data from an ecological monitoring project in southern New Mexico. The analysis suggests a cause-effect hypothesis of recent desertification in the North American Southwest. The links between the atmosphere and the biosphere are based on the fundamentally different responses to specific weather regimes of semidesert grasses with a C(4) photosynthetic pathway and desert shrubs with a C(3) photosynthetic pathway. The hypothesis appears to be of sufficient generality to explain the complex, but well-documented, floristic changes that have occurred in the same region since the last glacial maximum."

This transition corresponds to the pK for the first hydrolysis constant of the aqueous aluminum ion and appears to be a consistent phenomenon independent of field location, ionic strength, and sulfate concentration. Nonconservative behavior is closely correlated with the equilibrium solubility of a microcrystalline gibbsite or amorphous aluminum hydroxide."
https://openalex.org/W2065246226,A new instrument called the tunneling microscope has recently been developed that is capable of generating real-space images of surfaces showing atomic structure. These images offer a new view of matter on an atomic scale. The current capabilities and limitations and the physics involved in the technique are discussed along with specific results from a study of silicon crystal surfaces.
https://openalex.org/W2073070845,"Phenotypic reversal of Nif(-) mutant strains to Nif(+) under molybdenum-deficient conditions has been cited as evidence that Azotobacter vinelandii possesses two nitrogen fixation systems: the conventional molybdenum-enzyme system and an alternative nitrogen-fixation system. Since explanations other than the existence of an alternative system were possible, deletion strains of A. vinelandii lacking the structural genes for conventional nitrogenase (nifHDK) were constructed. These strains were found to grow in molybdenum-deficient nitrogen-free media, reduce acetylene (at low rates), and incorporate molecular nitrogen labeled with nitrogen-15. Thus it can be concluded that the phenotypic reversal phenomenon cannot be due to altered phenotypic expression of nif mutations under molybdenum-deficient conditions, but is due to the existence of an alternative nitrogen-fixation system in A. vinelandii as originally proposed."

The active compound was isolated from chloroform:methanol extracts of L. arvalis mycelia and characterized as a previously unknown hydroxy fatty acid, (Z,Z-9,12-8-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid."
https://openalex.org/W2089107920,"An oxygen-binding hemoglobin localized in the nerves of Tellina alternata (Bivalvia) required 30 minutes to unload oxygen when excised nerves were exposed to pure nitrogen. Neural excitability under these conditions could be sustained only until deoxygenation of the hemoglobin was complete. When the oxygen-combining function of the hemoglobin was abolished with carbon monoxide, the neural excitability ceased within a few minutes of oxygen removal, a response identical to that of hemoglobinless homologous nerves of other bivalves. These results demonstrate that aerobic activity can be supported by the oxygen stored on hemoglobin in microscopic tissues for a considerable time under anoxic conditions."

https://openalex.org/W2013589773,"Pattern discrimination by dewinged walking flies (Boettcherisca peregrina) was tested in behavioral experiments. After emergence, the flies were deprived of light or visual patterns. Deprivation impaired the normal development of visual pattern discrimination without impairing phototaxis. Flies kept in a lighted, white, unpatterned environment could not discriminate visual patterns, nor could flies kept in continuous darkness. These results indicate that there is considerable plasticity in the structure of the visual system of these flies."
https://openalex.org/W2078279670,"Nearly continuous measurements at Cape Meares, Oregon, revealed that methane was increasing in the earth's atmosphere and that its concentration varied cyclically with the seasons. After 6 years of measurements, results show that the rate of increase in methane undergoes interannual variations; the most prominent of these coincided with the last major El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation, when methane concentrations fell far below expected levels. One of the consequences of the interannual variability is that the long-term rate of increase at Cape Meares is now about 16 parts per billion by volume per year, or about 1 percent annually, which is significantly less than that indicated by the earliest calculations."

Despite many attempts, embryos have not been observed until now. This report details the surface morphology and extraembryonic circulatory pattern. It was found that development, as in other extant cephalopods, is direct, without larval stages. There appears to be no embryonic protoconch associated with shell ontogeny."
