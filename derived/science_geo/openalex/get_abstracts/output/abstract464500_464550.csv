https://openalex.org/W1967440935,"Adrenal aldosterone-producing adenomas (APAs) constitutively produce the salt-retaining hormone aldosterone and are a common cause of severe hypertension. Recurrent mutations in the potassium channel gene KCNJ5 that result in cell depolarization and Ca(2+) influx cause ∼40% of these tumors. We identified 5 somatic mutations (4 altering Gly403 and 1 altering Ile770) in CACNA1D, encoding a voltage-gated calcium channel, among 43 APAs without mutated KCNJ5. The altered residues lie in the S6 segments that line the channel pore. Both alterations result in channel activation at less depolarized potentials; Gly403 alterations also impair channel inactivation. These effects are inferred to cause increased Ca(2+) influx, which is a sufficient stimulus for aldosterone production and cell proliferation in adrenal glomerulosa. We also identified de novo germline mutations at identical positions in two children with a previously undescribed syndrome featuring primary aldosteronism and neuromuscular abnormalities. These findings implicate gain-of-function Ca(2+) channel mutations in APAs and primary aldosteronism."

https://openalex.org/W1982088425,"Glioblastoma is one of the most challenging forms of cancer to treat. Here we describe a computational platform that integrates the analysis of copy number variations and somatic mutations and unravels the landscape of in-frame gene fusions in glioblastoma. We found mutations with loss of heterozygosity in LZTR1, encoding an adaptor of CUL3-containing E3 ligase complexes. Mutations and deletions disrupt LZTR1 function, which restrains the self renewal and growth of glioma spheres that retain stem cell features. Loss-of-function mutations in CTNND2 target a neural-specific gene and are associated with the transformation of glioma cells along the very aggressive mesenchymal phenotype. We also report recurrent translocations that fuse the coding sequence of EGFR to several partners, with EGFR-SEPT14 being the most frequent functional gene fusion in human glioblastoma. EGFR-SEPT14 fusions activate STAT3 signaling and confer mitogen independence and sensitivity to EGFR inhibition. These results provide insights into the pathogenesis of glioblastoma and highlight new targets for therapeutic intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2147538742,"Predictions about future rewarding events have a powerful influence on behaviour. The phasic spike activity of dopamine-containing neurons, and corresponding dopamine transients in the striatum, are thought to underlie these predictions, encoding positive and negative reward prediction errors. However, many behaviours are directed towards distant goals, for which transient signals may fail to provide sustained drive. Here we report an extended mode of reward-predictive dopamine signalling in the striatum that emerged as rats moved towards distant goals. These dopamine signals, which were detected with fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV), gradually increased or--in rare instances--decreased as the animals navigated mazes to reach remote rewards, rather than having phasic or steady tonic profiles. These dopamine increases (ramps) scaled flexibly with both the distance and size of the rewards. During learning, these dopamine signals showed spatial preferences for goals in different locations and readily changed in magnitude to reflect changing values of the distant rewards. Such prolonged dopamine signalling could provide sustained motivational drive, a control mechanism that may be important for normal behaviour and that can be impaired in a range of neurologic and neuropsychiatric disorders."

Such cells, which have been identified in rats, bats and monkeys, are believed to support a wide range of spatial behaviors. Recording neuronal activity from neurosurgical patients performing a virtual-navigation task, we identified cells exhibiting grid-like spiking patterns in the human brain, suggesting that humans and simpler animals rely on homologous spatial-coding schemes."
https://openalex.org/W2102152192,"Although angiogenesis inhibitors have provided substantial clinical benefit as cancer therapeutics, their use is limited by resistance to their therapeutic effects. While ample evidence indicates that such resistance can be influenced by the tumor microenvironment, the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Here, we have uncovered a paracrine signaling network between the adaptive and innate immune systems that is associated with resistance in multiple tumor models: lymphoma, lung and colon. Tumor-infiltrating T helper type 17 (T(H)17) cells and interleukin-17 (IL-17) induced the expression of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) through nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and extracellular-related kinase (ERK) signaling, leading to immature myeloid-cell mobilization and recruitment into the tumor microenvironment. The occurrence of T(H)17 cells and Bv8-positive granulocytes was also observed in clinical tumor specimens. Tumors resistant to treatment with antibodies to VEGF were rendered sensitive in IL-17 receptor (IL-17R)-knockout hosts deficient in T(H)17 effector function. Furthermore, pharmacological blockade of T(H)17 cell function sensitized resistant tumors to therapy with antibodies to VEGF. These findings indicate that IL-17 promotes tumor resistance to VEGF inhibition, suggesting that immunomodulatory strategies could improve the efficacy of anti-angiogenic therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2018217184,"Mutations in mitochondrial DNA that inhibit the normal function of this organelle can result in disease if a sufficient percentage of mitochondria in the body's cells harbor such alterations. Using transcription activator–like effector nuclease (TALEN) technology, Carlos Moraes and his colleagues show that mutant mitochondria can be selectively targeted and eliminated, allowing for a sufficient percentage increase of normal mitochondria and thus restoration of normal respiration in a cell-based model. Mitochondrial diseases are commonly caused by mutated mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which in most cases coexists with wild-type mtDNA, resulting in mtDNA heteroplasmy. We have engineered transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) to localize to mitochondria and cleave different classes of pathogenic mtDNA mutations. Mitochondria-targeted TALEN (mitoTALEN) expression led to permanent reductions in deletion or point-mutant mtDNA in patient-derived cells, raising the possibility that these mitochondrial nucleases can be therapeutic for some mitochondrial diseases."

In this work acylation and deacylation rates were measured against the clinically important enzymes CTX-M-15, KPC-2, Enterobacter cloacae AmpC, Pseudomonas aeruginosa AmpC, OXA-10, and OXA-48. The efficiency of acylation (k2/Ki) varied across the enzyme spectrum, from 1.1 × 101 m−1s−1 for OXA-10 to 1.0 × 105 for CTX-M-15. Inhibition of OXA-10 was shown to follow the covalent reversible mechanism, and the acylated OXA-10 displayed the longest residence time for deacylation, with a half-life of greater than 5 days. Across multiple enzymes, acyl enzyme stability was assessed by mass spectrometry. These inhibited enzyme forms were stable to rearrangement or hydrolysis, with the exception of KPC-2. KPC-2 displayed a slow hydrolytic route that involved fragmentation of the acyl-avibactam complex. The identity of released degradation products was investigated, and a possible mechanism for the slow deacylation from KPC-2 is proposed.Background: Avibactam is a β-lactamase inhibitor with a broad spectrum of activity.Results: Kinetic parameters of inhibition as well as acyl enzyme stability are reported against six clinically relevant enzymes.Conclusion: Inhibition efficiency is highest against class A, then class C, and then class D.Significance: These base-line inhibition values across enzyme classes provide the foundation for future structural and mechanistic enzymology experiments.

https://openalex.org/W2008069212,"Neuromodulatory control by oxytocin is essential to a wide range of social, parental and stress-related behaviours. Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are associated with deficiencies in oxytocin levels and with genetic alterations of the oxytocin receptor (OXTR). Thirty years ago, Mühlethaler et al. found that oxytocin increases the firing of inhibitory hippocampal neurons, but it remains unclear how elevated inhibition could account for the ability of oxytocin to improve information processing in the brain. Here we describe in mammalian hippocampus a simple yet powerful mechanism by which oxytocin enhances cortical information transfer while simultaneously lowering background activity, thus greatly improving the signal-to-noise ratio. Increased fast-spiking interneuron activity not only suppresses spontaneous pyramidal cell firing, but also enhances the fidelity of spike transmission and sharpens spike timing. Use-dependent depression at the fast-spiking interneuron-pyramidal cell synapse is both necessary and sufficient for the enhanced spike throughput. We show the generality of this novel circuit mechanism by activation of fast-spiking interneurons with cholecystokinin or channelrhodopsin-2. This provides insight into how a diffusely delivered neuromodulator can improve the performance of neural circuitry that requires synapse specificity and millisecond precision."
https://openalex.org/W1982429165,"The germ-cell lineage ensures the continuity of life through the generation of male and female gametes, which unite to form a totipotent zygote. We have previously demonstrated that, by using cytokines, embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells can be induced into epiblast-like cells (EpiLCs) and then into primordial germ cell (PGC)-like cells with the capacity for both spermatogenesis and oogenesis, creating an opportunity for understanding and regulating mammalian germ-cell development in both sexes in vitro. Here we show that, without cytokines, simultaneous overexpression of three transcription factors, Blimp1 (also known as Prdm1), Prdm14 and Tfap2c (also known as AP2γ), directs EpiLCs, but not embryonic stem cells, swiftly and efficiently into a PGC state. Notably, Prdm14 alone, but not Blimp1 or Tfap2c, suffices for the induction of the PGC state in EpiLCs. The transcription-factor-induced PGC state, irrespective of the transcription factors used, reconstitutes key transcriptome and epigenetic reprogramming in PGCs, but bypasses a mesodermal program that accompanies PGC or PGC-like-cell specification by cytokines including bone morphogenetic protein 4. Notably, the transcription-factor-induced PGC-like cells contribute to spermatogenesis and fertile offspring. Our findings provide a new insight into the transcriptional logic for PGC specification, and create a foundation for the transcription-factor-based reconstitution and regulation of mammalian gametogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2023440163,"Obesity is often accompanied by hyperuricemia. However, purine metabolism in various tissues, especially regarding uric acid production, has not been fully elucidated. Here we report, using mouse models, that adipose tissue could produce and secrete uric acid through xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) and that the production was enhanced in obesity. Plasma uric acid was elevated in obese mice and attenuated by administration of the XOR inhibitor febuxostat. Adipose tissue was one of major organs that had abundant expression and activities of XOR, and adipose tissues in obese mice had higher XOR activities than those in control mice. 3T3-L1 and mouse primary mature adipocytes produced and secreted uric acid into culture medium. The secretion was inhibited by febuxostat in a dose-dependent manner or by gene knockdown of XOR. Surgical ischemia in adipose tissue increased local uric acid production and secretion via XOR, with a subsequent increase in circulating uric acid levels. Uric acid secretion from whole adipose tissue was increased in obese mice, and uric acid secretion from 3T3-L1 adipocytes was increased under hypoxia. Our results suggest that purine catabolism in adipose tissue could be enhanced in obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2086718017,"Drp1 (dynamin-related protein 1) is recruited to both mitochondrial and peroxisomal membranes to execute fission. Fis1 and Mff are Drp1 receptor/effector proteins of mitochondria and peroxisomes. Recently, MiD49 and MiD51 were also shown to recruit Drp1 to the mitochondrial surface; however, different reports have ascribed opposing roles in fission and fusion. Here, we show that MiD49 or MiD51 overexpression blocked fission by acting in a dominant-negative manner by sequestering Drp1 specifically at mitochondria, causing unopposed fusion events at mitochondria along with elongation of peroxisomes. Mitochondrial elongation caused by MiD49/51 overexpression required the action of fusion mediators mitofusins 1 and 2. Furthermore, at low level overexpression when MiD49 and MiD51 form discrete foci at mitochondria, mitochondrial fission events still occurred. Unlike Fis1 and Mff, MiD49 and MiD51 were not targeted to the peroxisomal surface, suggesting that they specifically act to facilitate Drp1-directed fission at mitochondria. Moreover, when MiD49 or MiD51 was targeted to the surface of peroxisomes or lysosomes, Drp1 was specifically recruited to these organelles. Moreover, the Drp1 recruitment activity of MiD49/51 appeared stronger than that of Mff or Fis1. We conclude that MiD49 and MiD51 can act independently of Mff and Fis1 in Drp1 recruitment and suggest that they provide specificity to the division of mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W2091446808,"By examining the genetic makeup of Northern Finnish sub-isolate populations, Stoll et al. show association between deletion of a topoisomerase III gene (TOP3B) and both schizophrenia and cognitive impairment. They also uncover a mechanism for the concomitant integration of TOP3β with the fragile X protein FMRP into messenger ribonucleoprotein complexes Implicating particular genes in the generation of complex brain and behavior phenotypes requires multiple lines of evidence. The rarity of most high-impact genetic variants typically precludes the possibility of accruing statistical evidence that they are associated with a given trait. We found that the enrichment of a rare chromosome 22q11.22 deletion in a recently expanded Northern Finnish sub-isolate enabled the detection of association between TOP3B and both schizophrenia and cognitive impairment. Biochemical analysis of TOP3β revealed that this topoisomerase was a component of cytosolic messenger ribonucleoproteins (mRNPs) and was catalytically active on RNA. The recruitment of TOP3β to mRNPs was independent of RNA cis-elements and was coupled to the co-recruitment of FMRP, the disease gene product in fragile X mental retardation syndrome. Our results indicate a previously unknown role for TOP3β in mRNA metabolism and suggest that it is involved in neurodevelopmental disorders."

https://openalex.org/W2004575367,"Topoisomerases are crucial for solving DNA topological problems, but they have not been linked to RNA metabolism. Here we show that human topoisomerase 3β (Top3β) is an RNA topoisomerase that biochemically and genetically interacts with FMRP, a protein that is deficient in fragile X syndrome and is known to regulate the translation of mRNAs that are important for neuronal function, abnormalities of which are linked to autism. Notably, the FMRP-Top3β interaction is abolished by a disease-associated mutation of FMRP, suggesting that Top3β may contribute to the pathogenesis of mental disorders. Top3β binds multiple mRNAs encoded by genes with neuronal functions linked to schizophrenia and autism. Expression of one such gene, that encoding protein tyrosine kinase 2 (ptk2, also known as focal adhesion kinase or FAK), is reduced in the neuromuscular junctions of Top3β mutant flies. Synapse formation is defective in Top3β mutant flies and mice, as well as in FMRP mutant flies and mice. Our findings suggest that Top3β acts as an RNA topoisomerase and works with FMRP to promote the expression of mRNAs that are crucial for neurodevelopment and mental health."
https://openalex.org/W2004132028,"By monitoring metabolic and neuronal activity in nonhuman primates after long-term training, Picard, Matsuzaka and Strick show that skill learning is correlated with a reduction in metabolic activity in the primary motor cortex without affecting neuronal firing. This suggests that skill learning results in an increase in the metabolic and synaptic efficiency in the motor cortex. How does long-term training and the development of motor skills modify the activity of the primary motor cortex (M1)? To address this issue, we trained monkeys for ∼1–6 years to perform visually guided and internally generated sequences of reaching movements. Then, we used [14C]2-deoxyglucose (2DG) uptake and single-neuron recording to measure metabolic and neuron activity in M1. After extended practice, we observed a profound reduction of metabolic activity in M1 for the performance of internally generated compared to visually guided tasks. In contrast, measures of neuron firing displayed little difference during the two tasks. These findings suggest that the development of skill through extended practice results in a reduction in the synaptic activity required to produce internally generated, but not visually guided, sequences of movements. Thus, practice leading to skilled performance results in more efficient generation of neuronal activity in M1."
https://openalex.org/W2133748767,"Augmentation of endogenous cannabinoid (eCB) signaling represents an emerging approach to the treatment of affective disorders. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) oxygenates arachidonic acid to form prostaglandins, but also inactivates eCBs in vitro. However, the viability of COX-2 as a therapeutic target for in vivo eCB augmentation has not been explored. Using medicinal chemistry and in vivo analytical and behavioral pharmacological approaches, we found that COX-2 is important for the regulation of eCB levels in vivo. We used a pharmacological strategy involving substrate-selective inhibition of COX-2 to augment eCB signaling without affecting related non-eCB lipids or prostaglandin synthesis. Behaviorally, substrate-selective inhibition of COX-2 reduced anxiety-like behaviors in mice via increased eCB signaling. Our data suggest a key role for COX-2 in the regulation of eCB signaling and indicate that substrate-selective pharmacology represents a viable approach for eCB augmentation with broad therapeutic potential."

Endothelial dysfunction is the common denominator. To shed light on the underlying mechanism, we participated in the Progress 40P mission with Spaceflight of Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs): an Integrated Experiment (SPHINX), which consisted of 12 in-flight and 12 ground-based control modules and lasted 10 d. Postflight microarray analysis revealed 1023 significantly modulated genes, the majority of which are involved in cell adhesion, oxidative phosphorylation, stress responses, cell cycle, and apoptosis. Thioredoxin-interacting protein was the most up-regulated (33-fold), heat-shock proteins 70 and 90 the most down-regulated (5.6-fold). Ion channels (TPCN1, KCNG2, KCNJ14, KCNG1, KCNT1, TRPM1, CLCN4, CLCA2), mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, and focal adhesion were widely affected. Cytokine detection in the culture media indicated significant increased secretion of interleukin-1α and interleukin-1β. Nitric oxide was found not modulated. Our data suggest that in cultured HUVECs, microgravity affects the same molecular machinery responsible for sensing alterations of flow and generates a prooxidative environment that activates inflammatory responses, alters endothelial behavior, and promotes senescence.—Versari, S., Longinotti, G., Barenghi, L., Maier, J.

https://openalex.org/W2143622218,"Changes in the regulation of connective tissue ATP-mediated mechano-transduction and remodeling may be an important link to the pathogenesis of chronic pain. It has been demonstrated that mast cell-derived histamine plays an important role in painful fibrotic diseases. Here we analyzed the involvement of ATP in the response of human subcutaneous fibroblasts to histamine. Acute histamine application caused a rise in intracellular Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)]i) and ATP release from human subcutaneous fibroblasts via H1 receptor activation. Histamine-induced [Ca(2+)]i rise was partially attenuated by apyrase, an enzyme that inactivates extracellular ATP, and by blocking P2 purinoceptors with pyridoxal phosphate-6-azo(benzene-2,4-disulfonic acid) tetrasodium salt and reactive blue 2. [Ca(2+)]i accumulation caused by histamine was also reduced upon blocking pannexin-1 hemichannels with (10)Panx, probenecid, or carbenoxolone but not when connexin hemichannels were inhibited with mefloquine or 2-octanol. Brefeldin A, an inhibitor of vesicular exocytosis, also did not block histamine-induced [Ca(2+)]i mobilization. Prolonged exposure of human subcutaneous fibroblast cultures to histamine favored cell growth and type I collagen synthesis via the activation of H1 receptor. This effect was mimicked by ATP and its metabolite, ADP, whereas the selective P2Y1 receptor antagonist, MRS2179, partially attenuated histamine-induced cell growth and type I collagen production. Expression of pannexin-1 and ADP-sensitive P2Y1 receptor on human subcutaneous fibroblasts was confirmed by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy and Western blot analysis. In conclusion, histamine induces ATP release from human subcutaneous fibroblasts, via pannexin-1 hemichannels, leading to [Ca(2+)]i mobilization and cell growth through the cooperation of H1 and P2 (probably P2Y1) receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2038119991,"Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a heterotrimeric serine/threonine phosphatase involved in essential cellular functions. T cells from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) express high levels of the catalytic subunit of PP2A (PP2Ac). A mouse overexpressing PP2Ac in T cells develops glomerulonephritis in an IL-17-dependent manner. Here, using microarray analyses, we demonstrate that increased expression of PP2Ac grants T cells the capacity to produce an array of proinflammatory effector molecules. Because IL-17 is important in the expression of glomerulonephritis, we studied the mechanism through which PP2Ac dysregulation facilitates its production. We report that PP2Ac is involved in the regulation of the Il17 locus by enhancing histone 3 acetylation through a mechanism that involves activation of interferon regulatory factor 4. Increased histone 3 acetylation of the Il17 locus is shared between T cells of PP2Ac transgenic mice and patients with SLE. We propose that, by promoting the inflammatory capacity of T cells, PP2Ac dysregulation contributes to the pathogenesis of SLE."
https://openalex.org/W2161082720,"The gram-negative anaerobe Porphyromonas gingivalis colonizes the gingival crevice and is etiologically associated with periodontal disease that can lead to alveolar bone damage and resorption, promoting tooth loss. Although susceptible to antibiotics, P. gingivalis can evade antibiotic killing by residing within gingival keratinocytes. This provides a reservoir of organisms that may recolonize the gingival crevice once antibiotic therapy is complete. Polymersomes are nanosized amphiphilic block copolymer vesicles that can encapsulate drugs. Cells internalize polymersomes by endocytosis into early endosomes, where they are disassembled by the low pH, causing intracellular release of their drug load. In this study, polymersomes were used as vehicles to deliver antibiotics in an attempt to kill intracellular P. gingivalis within monolayers of keratinocytes and organotypic oral mucosal models. Polymersome-encapsulated metronidazole or doxycycline, free metronidazole, or doxycycline, or polymersomes alone as controls, were used, and the number of surviving intracellular P. gingivalis was quantified after host cell lysis. Polymersome-encapsulated metronidazole or doxycycline significantly (P<0.05) reduced the number of intracellular P. gingivalis in both monolayer and organotypic cultures compared to free antibiotic or polymersome alone controls. Polymersomes are effective delivery vehicles for antibiotics that do not normally gain entry to host cells. This approach could be used to treat recurrent periodontitis or other diseases caused by intra-cellular-dwelling organisms.—Wayakanon, K., Thornhill, M. H., Douglas, C. W. I., Lewis, A.

https://openalex.org/W2050445393,"DNA polymerase δ (Pol δ4) is a heterotetrameric enzyme, whose p12 subunit is degraded in response to DNA damage, leaving behind a trimer (Pol δ3) with altered enzymatic characteristics that participate in gap filling during DNA repair. We demonstrate that CRL4(Cdt2), a key regulator of cell cycle progression that targets replication licensing factors, also targets the p12 subunit of Pol δ4 in response to DNA damage and on entry into S phase. Evidence for the involvement of CRL4(Cdt2) included demonstration that p12 possesses a proliferating cell nuclear antigen-interacting protein-degron (PIP-degron) and that knockdown of the components of the CRL4(Cdt2) complex inhibited the degradation of p12 in response to DNA damage. Analysis of p12 levels in synchronized cell populations showed that p12 is partially degraded in S phase and that this is affected by knockdowns of CUL4A or CUL4B. Laser scanning cytometry of overexpressed wild type p12 and a mutant resistant to degradation showed that the reduction in p12 levels during S phase was prevented by mutation of p12. Thus, CRL4(Cdt2) also regulates the subunit composition of Pol δ during the cell cycle. These studies reveal a novel function of CRL4(Cdt2), i.e. the direct regulation of DNA polymerase δ, adding to its known functions in the regulation of the licensing of replication origins and expanding the scope of its overall control of DNA replication. The formation of Pol δ3 in S phase as a normal aspect of cell cycle progression leads to the novel implications that it is involved in DNA replication as well as DNA repair."
https://openalex.org/W2163785679,"Transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) has significant profibrotic activity both in vitro and in vivo. This reflects its capacity to stimulate fibrogenic mediators and induce the expression of other profibrotic cytokines such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF/ErbB) ligands. Here we address both the mechanisms by which TGFβ induced ErbB ligands and the physiological significance of inhibiting multiple TGFβ-regulated processes. The data document that ErbB ligand induction requires PDGF receptor (PDGFR) mediation and engages a positive autocrine/paracrine feedback loop via ErbB receptors. Whereas PDGFRs are essential for TGFβ-stimulated ErbB ligand up-regulation, TGFβ-specific signals are also required for ErbB receptor activation. Subsequent profibrotic responses are shown to involve the cooperative action of PDGF and ErbB signaling. Moreover, using a murine treatment model of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis we found that inhibition of TGFβ/PDGF and ErbB pathways with imatinib plus lapatinib, respectively, not only prevented myofibroblast gene expression to a greater extent than either drug alone, but also essentially stabilized gas exchange (oxygen saturation) as an overall measure of lung function. These observations provide important mechanistic insights into profibrotic TGFβ signaling and indicate that targeting multiple cytokines represents a possible strategy to ameliorate organ fibrosis dependent on TGFβ.—Andrianifahanana, M., Wilkes, M.

https://openalex.org/W2039694742,"It is a little known fact that plastoquinone-9, a vital redox cofactor of photosynthesis, doubles as a precursor for the biosynthesis of a vitamin E analog called plastochromanol-8, the physiological significance of which has remained elusive. Gene network reconstruction, GFP fusion experiments, and targeted metabolite profiling of insertion mutants indicated that Arabidopsis possesses two paralogous solanesyl-diphosphate synthases, AtSPS1 (At1g78510) and AtSPS2 (At1g17050), that assemble the side chain of plastoquinone-9 in plastids. Similar paralogous pairs were detected throughout terrestrial plant lineages but were not distinguished in the literature and genomic databases from mitochondrial homologs involved in the biosynthesis of ubiquinone. The leaves of the atsps2 knock-out were devoid of plastochromanol-8 and displayed severe losses of both non-photoactive and photoactive plastoquinone-9, resulting in near complete photoinhibition at high light intensity. Such a photoinhibition was paralleled by significant damage to photosystem II but not to photosystem I. In contrast, in the atsps1 knock-out, a small loss of plastoquinone-9, restricted to the non-photoactive pool, was sufficient to eliminate half of the plastochromanol-8 content of the leaves. Taken together, these results demonstrate that plastochromanol-8 originates from a subfraction of the non-photoactive pool of plastoquinone-9. In contrast to other plastochromanol-8 biosynthetic mutants, neither the single atsps knock-outs nor the atsps1 atsps2 double knock-out displayed any defects in tocopherols accumulation or germination."

https://openalex.org/W1999156258,"The KLF5 (Krüppel-like factor 5) transcription factor is specifically expressed in a subset of estrogen receptor α-negative breast cancers. Although KLF5 promotes breast cancer cell cycle progression, survival, and tumorigenesis, the mechanism by which KLF5 promotes breast cancer is still not entirely understood. Here, we demonstrate that mPGES1, encoding microsomal prostaglandin E2 synthase 1 (mPGES1), is a KLF5 direct downstream target gene. KLF5 overexpression or knockdown positively altered the levels of mPGES1 mRNA and protein in multiple breast cell lines. 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate induced the expression of both KLF5 and mPGES1 in dosage- and time-dependent manners. The induction of KLF5 was essential for 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate to induce mPGES1 expression. Additionally, KLF5 bound to the mPGES1 gene proximal promoter and activated its transcription. Both KLF5 and mPGES1 promoted prostaglandin E2 production; regulated p21, p27, and Survivin downstream gene expression; and likewise stimulated cell proliferation. Overexpression of mPGES1 partially rescued the KLF5 knockdown-induced downstream gene expression changes and growth arrest in MCF10A cells. Finally, we demonstrate that the expression of mPGES1 was positively correlated with the estrogen receptor α/progesterone receptor/HER2 triple-negative status. These findings suggest that mPGES1 is a target gene of KLF5, making it a new biomarker and a potential therapeutic target for triple-negative breast cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2037093831,"The carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP) is a glucose-responsive transcription factor that plays a critical role in converting excess carbohydrate to storage fat in liver. In response to changing glucose levels, ChREBP activity is regulated by nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of ChREBP via interactions with 14-3-3 proteins and importins. The nuclear/cytosol trafficking is regulated partly by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of serine 196 mediated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase and protein phosphatase.

These metabolites were identified as β-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate. Nuclear localization of GFP-ChREBP is rapidly inhibited in hepatocytes incubated in β-hydroxybutyrate or fatty acids, and the observed inhibition is closely correlated with the production of ketone bodies.

ChREBP is a large transcription factor of 96 kDa containing several functional domains, including two nuclear export signals, NES1 and NES2, an extended bipartite nuclear import signal (NLS), and a DNA binding basic helix-loop-helix/Zip domain (Fig. 1). ChREBP function is regulated at two levels, nuclear translocation and DNA binding (1.Uyeda K. Repa J.J.

Phosphorylation/dephosphorylation is a major mechanism by which ChREBP activity is regulated, and it is mediated through multiple phosphorylation sites, including consensus sites for cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and AMP-dependent protein kinase (AMPK) (8.Kawaguchi T.

Phosphorylation by either PKA or AMPK inhibits glycolysis and lipogenesis through inactivation of ChREBP.

When glucose availability is low, the phosphorylated inactive pool of ChREBP (ChREBP-Ser(P)-196) binds 14-3-3 proteins and CRM-1, transits out of the nucleus, and localizes in the cytosol (5.Sakiyama H.

After ingestion of food, increased glucose levels lead to the conversion of inactive ChREBP(P) in the cytosol into active ChREBP, which results in ChREBP binding to import proteins and translocation into the nucleus to facilitate transcription of target genes encoding proteins important for glycolysis and lipogenesis (8.Kawaguchi T.

To begin to elucidate how ChREBP senses glucose, we have used a biochemical approach to determine the steps involved in ChREBP import and export (Fig. 2). We determined that the first step in nuclear localization of ChREBP is activation of the ChREBP(P)·14-3-3 complex by dephosphorylation of ChREBP in the cytosol, presumably by xylulose-5-P (Xu-5-P)-activated protein phosphatase (PP2A) (14.Kabashima T. Kawaguchi T. Wadzinski B.E. Uyeda K. Xylulose 5-phosphate mediates glucose-induced lipogenesis by xylulose 5-phosphate-activated protein phosphatase in rat liver.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 5107-5112Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The activated dephospho-ChREBP next forms a complex with importin proteins, and the complex subsequently transits to the nucleus. Under conditions of low glucose, phosphorylation by PKA inactivates ChREBP, resulting in association of ChREBP(P) with 14-3-3 proteins and CRM-1, followed by translocation to the cytosol. Thus, the following functional domains can be assigned to the ChREBP/N-terminal region of ChREBP (residues 1–250), which binds 14-3-3, CRM-1, and/or importin α and is solely responsible for the import and export of ChREBP, and the C-terminal region (residues 251–846), which is responsible for transcriptional activity (5.Sakiyama H. Wynn R.M. Lee W.R. Fukasawa M. Mizuguchi H. Gardner K.H. Repa J.J. Uyeda K.

Despite extensive investigation, the biochemical mechanisms responsible for glucose sensing and for induction of ChREBP activity remain unclear. No approaches have yet identified a specific metabolite or allosteric ligand that is responsive to circulating blood glucose levels, thus serving as a glucose-signaling second messenger. It has been suggested that glucose-6-P instead, or in addition to Xu-5-P, functions as a glucose-signaling compound (15.Dentin R. Tomas-Cobos L. Foufelle F. Leopold J. Girard J. Postic C. Ferré P.

Xu-5-P activates only the dephosphorylation reaction of ChREBP(P) catalyzed by PP2ABδC, the first step in ChREBP activation. We hypothesize that other metabolites might control nuclear import of ChREBP, the second step in the activation process. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. Bacterial expression vectors for GST-tagged importin α were gifts from Dr. Y. Yoneda (Osaka University, Osaka, Japan), and those for the human 14-3-3 proteins were gifts from Dr. Steven L. McKnight (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). His-tagged human 14-3-3β was transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21. Expression of the 14-3-3β proteins was facilitated by the addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.1 mm) followed by incubation at 20 °C with shaking at 200 rpm for 16 h. GST fusion proteins were purified using glutathione-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's instructions. His-tagged proteins were purified by affinity chromatography using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid. The peptides containing α-helix (residues 117–149) of ChREBP phosphorylated at Ser-140, designated as “α2-Ser-140p,” were synthesized by the Peptide Synthesis Group at the University of Texas Southwestern. The peptide containing the α3-helix regions and the phosphorylated Ser-196 site of ChREBP (residues 170–198), designated as “α3-Ser-196p” was also synthesized by the Peptide Synthesis group at the University of Texas Southwestern. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Research Advisory Committee of the Veterans Affairs Medical Center approved all animal studies. Male rats 6–10 weeks of age were housed in temperature-controlled facilities with 12-h light/dark cycles and maintained on standard rodent chow (“NIH”) (Harlan-Teklad Mouse/Rat Diet 7002; Harlan-Teklad Premier Laboratory Diets). The high sucrose (“HS”) and high fat (“HF”) diets were described as before (17.Iizuka K. Miller B. Uyeda K.

Immunoblotting method (“pulldown”) was carried out as described before (5.Sakiyama H. Wynn R.M. Lee W.R. Fukasawa M. Mizuguchi H. Gardner K.H. Repa J.J. Uyeda K.

Briefly, FLAG-tagged wild type (WT)-ChREBP was expressed in HEK293 cells and then purified from cell lysate by binding to anti-FLAG antibody beads in the reaction mixture containing 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.3, 0.5 mm EGTA, 60 mm KAc, 2 mm MgAc, 5 mm NaAc, 1% Nonidet P-40 and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle rocking. Pure exogenous 14-3-3β and/or GST-tagged importin α were added to the beads bound with ChREBP and the 14-3-3 and/or importin α proteins and incubated with shaking for 1.5 h at 4 °C. Bound FLAG-ChREBP and the 14-3-3 and importin α proteins were then eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer and subjected to gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments were carried out using a VP-ITC microcalorimeter (MicroCal) as described before (5.Sakiyama H. Wynn R.M. Lee W.R. Fukasawa M. Mizuguchi H.

Briefly, His-tagged 14-3-3 proteins were dialyzed overnight into 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 mm EDTA. From these samples, 25 μm solutions of monomeric subunits were placed in the cell chamber of the calorimeter (cell volume 1.8 ml). For most ITC measurements, human 14-3-3β was used. Binding isotherms were measured as α2-Ser-140p or α3-Ser-196p and added to the chamber from a syringe with an initial peptide concentration of 250 μm. All titration experiments were performed at 20 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 mm EDTA. The ChREBP peptide was injected into the calorimetric cell in 10-μl increments. The binding isotherm derived from heat changes was used to calculate the standard free energy of binding (ΔG0) according to the equation ΔG0 = −RTlnKa, where R is the gas constant; T is the absolute temperature, and Ka is the association constant. From the binding isotherm, the number of binding sites (n) was obtained. Curve fitting and the derivation of thermodynamic parameters were carried out with the ORIGIN version 7.0 software package (MicroCal). The concentrations of 14-3-3 proteins and the ChREBP peptides, α2-Ser-140p (residues 117–149) and α3-Ser-196p (residues 170–198), were determined using extinction coefficients at 280 nm of 25.7 and 13.98 mm−1 cm−1, respectively. For metabolite isolation, protein-free extracts of livers were prepared according to the extraction methods described by Newton et al. (19.Newton R.P. Salih S.G. Salvage B.J. Kingston E.E.

Freeze-clamped rat liver (1 g) was homogenized in 3 ml of ice-cold 0.6 n HClO4 using a Polytron homogenizer at 0–4 °C, and the homogenate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant solution was neutralized with cold 1 n KOH. The precipitate was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant solution was either used directly for enzymatic assays for ketone bodies or for isolation of metabolites by HPLC. HPLC analysis of protein-free extracts was carried out as follows. Metabolite extracts (0.2 ml) were applied on a CarboPac PA1 column (4 mm × 250 mm) (Dionex) and eluted with a linear gradient of ammonium acetate (0–1 m, pH 5.0) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Eluted fractions were collected, concentrated by lyophilization, and assayed for an activity to increase the ChREBP·14-3-3β interaction using the “pulldown assay.” HPLC analysis was also carried out using a Synergi Fusion column (4.6 mm × 250 mm) (Phenomenex) and eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 50% saturation of methanol for the initial 5 min, followed by a linear gradient of 50–75% from 5 to 35 min. Eluates were concentrated by lyophilization and assayed. The early steps in the nuclear/cytosol translocation of ChREBP are direct protein/protein interactions between active dephospho-ChREBP with importin α in the nuclear import step, and inactive phosphorylated ChREBP(P) with the 14-3-3 proteins and CRM-1 in the export step (5.Sakiyama H.

Because ChREBP plays a critical role in coordinating carbohydrate metabolism and lipogenesis, independent of insulin, we hypothesize the existence of specific metabolites that might activate nuclear import of ChREBP in response to increased glucose uptake after eating. These proposed metabolites along with others might trigger nuclear export of ChREBP upon starvation. To this end, we searched first for a metabolite(s) in starved rat liver that might promote ChREBP binding to 14-3-3β. Using a ChREBP·14-3-3β pulldown assay, we identified a crude protein-free extract in the livers from starved rats containing a metabolite that promoted interaction between these proteins. This metabolite was highest in livers from starved (ST) animals, lowest in livers from HS animals (Fig. 3A), and intermediate in livers from animals fed lab chow (NIH) and HF diets. To isolate and identify the metabolite, ST liver extracts were subjected to HPLC separation, and the resolved eluates were assayed in a pulldown reaction containing FLAG-ChREBP and 14-3-3β. The results (Fig. 3B) indicated that only one fraction (fraction 10) contained a metabolite(s) that activated the ChREBP(P)/14-3-3 interaction. The active metabolites in the fraction were subsequently identified as the ketone bodies βHB and AcAc by enzymatic assay using β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase and GC-mass spectrometry analysis. Both βHB and AcAc standards elute within the same HPLC fraction, confirming the identities of the activator metabolites as ketone bodies. To confirm that βHB and AcAc were responsible for promoting ChREBP(P)/14-3-3 interaction in vivo, we measured the concentrations of total ketone bodies in the crude liver extracts of rats fed different diets (Fig. 3C). The concentration of βHB and AcAc was highest in the starved livers (2.2 μmol/g liver) and 5.2-fold higher than that in livers from the NIH-diet fed animals (0.43 μmol/g), which compares favorably to the extent of activation (4.5-fold) of ChREBP(P)/14-3-3 interaction (Fig. 3A). Similarly, the total ketone concentration in the livers from the high fat-fed animals (0.8 μmol/g) was 1.9-fold higher than that in the livers from animals fed the NIH diet, and the level of ChREBP(P)/14-3-3 activation by these extracts was ∼1.9-fold. The ketone concentration in livers from animals fed the HS diet (0.41 μmol/g) was similar to that in livers from the NIH diet-fed animals, but the activation was lower (0.8-fold). These observations indicate that activation of the ChREBP(P)·14-3-3 complex formation correlates very closely with the total ketone body concentrations in liver, further supporting a regulatory role for βHB and AcAc in promoting cytosolic localization of ChREBP during starvation. Ketone bodies are synthesized from β-hydroxy-β-methylglutaryl-CoA in cytoplasm generated by fatty acid oxidation in liver tissue exposed to starvation or a high fat diet (17.Iizuka K. Miller B. Uyeda K. Deficiency of carbohydrate-activated transcription factor ChREBP prevents obesity and improves plasma glucose control in leptin-deficient (ob/ob) mice.Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2006; 291: E358-E364Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Ketone bodies cannot be metabolized in liver because the tissue lacks 3-oxoacid CoA transferase (20.Orii K.E. Fukao T. Song X.Q. Mitchell G.A. Kondo N. Liver-specific silencing of the human gene encoding succinyl-CoA:3-ketoacid CoA transferase.Tohoku J. Exp. Med. 2008; 215: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and they are therefore exported out of the liver to other tissues where they are used as a source of energy. βHB and AcAc increase between 1 and 2 mm in blood and liver of rats when fasting as the liver switches to fatty acid oxidation (21.Williamson D.H. Lund P. Krebs H.A. The redox state of free nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide in the cytoplasm and mitochondria of rat liver.Biochem. J. 1967; 103: 514-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar), increasing to as much as 6–8 mm in liver during prolonged starvation (22.Lawson J.W. Guynn R.W. Cornell N.W. Veech R.L. Hansen R.W. Mehlman M.A. Gluconeogenesis: Its Regulation in Mammalian Species. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1976Google Scholar). In contrast, most major metabolites of glycolysis, the pentose-phosphate shunt, and glycogenolysis are decreased at least 2–4-fold under these conditions. Thus, it is plausible that βHB and AcAc activate and stabilize the ChREBP(P)·14-3-3 complex to ensure that ChREBP remains in the cytoplasm during starvation where it is incapable of activating lipogenesis. To determine how ketones promote ChREBP(P)/14-3-3 heterodimer formation, we measured the effect of βHB and AcAc on ChREBP affinity for 14-3-3 using a pulldown assay. Both ketone bodies promote ChREBP·14-3-3 heterodimer interactions with similar affinity (Ka = 0.5 mm) (Fig. 4A). The results also demonstrate that the affinity (Ka) of ChREBP for 14-3-3 increased ∼2-fold in the presence of 1 mm βHB compared with its absence (Fig. 4B), which is within the physiological concentration ranges of ketone bodies in livers of starved animals (>2 mm) and fed livers (<0.4 mm) (23.Lawson J.W. Uyeda K. Effects of insulin and work on fructose 2,6-bisphosphate content and phosphofructokinase activity in perfused rat hearts.J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3165-3173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To further investigate the mechanism by which ketone bodies promote ChREBP(P)/14-3-3 interactions, ITC was used to measure the effect of βHB on the interaction between 14-3-3β protein and two distinct ChREBP peptides corresponding to two 14-3-3-binding sites (amino acids 117–149, ”α2-Ser-140p,” and amino acids 170–198, “α3-Ser-196p”) (5.Sakiyama H. Wynn R.M. Lee W.R. Fukasawa M. Mizuguchi H. Gardner K.H. Repa J.J. Uyeda K. Regulation of nuclear import/export of carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP): interaction of an α-helix of ChREBP with the 14-3-3 proteins and regulation by phosphorylation.J. Biol.

Chem. 2011; 286: 28119-28127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). β-HB failed to bind to either the ChREBP peptides or the 14-3-3 proteins individually, but they did bind when both 14-3-3β and either of the ChREBP peptides were present (Table 1 and Fig. 5A). The interaction between the peptides and the 14-3-3β protein increased nearly 2-fold (KD decreased from 1.5 × 10−6 to 0.6 × 10−6 m) in the presence of 10 μm and 1 mm β-HB, respectively, and the binding of 14-3-3β protein to α3-Ser-196p peptide, which is a weaker binding site, was 30% lower than the same concentrations of the ketone body (KD decreased from 0.83 × 10−6 to 0.59 × 10−6 m). AcAc had little effect on the peptides binding under these conditions (Table 2 and Fig. 5B). These results suggest that ketone bodies directly promote ChREBP·14-3-3β protein interactions, possibly by inducing conformational changes in ChREBP and thereby stabilizing the ChREBP(P)·14-3-3 protein complex. Thus, we conclude based on the ITC data that ketone bodies represent a physiological signal produced by the liver in response to low blood glucose levels during starvation that inhibit fat synthesis by promoting ChREBP(P)·14-3-3 complex formation in the cytosol.TABLE 1Thermodynamic parameters for the interactions of human 14-3-3 proteins with human ChREBP peptides α2-Ser-140p and α3-Ser-196p in the presence of βHB as determined by isothermal titration calorimetryPeptides and β-hydroxybutyrateKdmα2-Ser-140p1.1 × 10−6α2-Ser-140p + 10 μm βΗΒ1.5 × 10−6α2-Ser-140p + 100 μm βΗΒ0.71 × 10−6α2-Ser-140p + 1000 μm βΗΒ0.60 × 10−6α3-Ser-196p0.78 × 10−6α3-Ser-196p + 10 μm βHB0.83 × 10−6α3-Ser-196p + 100 μm βΗΒ0.63 × 10−6α3-Ser-196p + 1000 μm βΗΒ0.59 × 10−6 Open table in a new tab TABLE 2Thermodynamic parameters for the interactions of human 14-3-3 proteins with human ChREBP peptides α2-Ser-140p and α3-Ser-196p in the presence of acetoacetate as determined by isothermal titration calorimetryPeptides and acetoacetateKdmα2-Ser-140p1.1 × 10−6α2-Ser-140p + 10 μm acetoacetate1.2 × 10−6α2-Ser-140p + 100 μm acetoacetate1.3 × 10−6α2-Ser-140p + 1000 μm acetoacetate1.1 × 10−6α3-Ser-196p0.51 × 10−6α3-Ser-196p + 10 μm acetoacetate0.62 × 10−6α3-Ser-196p + 100 μm acetoacetate0.64 × 10−6α3-Ser-196p + 1000 μm acetoacetate0.65 × 10−6 Open table in a new tab The discrepancy in the AcAc binding to ChREBP·14-3-3 could be because the ITC measurements were performed using the ChREBP peptides, whereas the pulldown assays were carried out with full-length FLAG-ChREBP protein, which would be closer to physiological conditions. To determine whether our biochemical findings with respect to ketone body promotion of ChREBP(P)/14-3-3 interactions have physiological relevance, we investigated whether ketone bodies affect nuclear localization and transcriptional activity of ChREBP. Ketone bodies are transported into hepatocytes by a monocarboxylate transporter (24.Koehler-Stec E.M. Simpson I.A. Vannucci S.J. Landschulz K.T. Landschulz W.H. Monocarboxylate transporter expression in mouse brain.Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: E516-E524PubMed Google Scholar). Primary hepatocytes expressing GFP-ChREBP were incubated in high glucose in the presence of βHB or AcAc, and GFP-ChREBP nuclear export was determined. Cells were incubated in high glucose (27.5 mm) along with βHB and AcAc to minimize ketone bodies that were otherwise produced by hepatocytes if plated under low glucose conditions. Under high glucose conditions, nuclear localization of GFP-ChREBP was rapidly inhibited by βHB and AcAc, reaching a maximum level within 2–3 h (Fig. 6A). Cytoplasmic localization of GFP-ChREBP in the presence of ketones was comparable with that present under low glucose (5.5 mm) conditions. In the high glucose control cells incubated in the absence of ketone bodies, GFP-ChREBP remained in the nucleus. We next investigated whether ketone bodies would affect ChREBP signaling. The transcriptional activity of ChREBP, which was assayed using a reporter containing the ChREBP-responsive liver pyruvate kinase promoter, decreased ∼20% when assayed 6 h after addition of ketone bodies (Fig. 6B). However, the transcriptional activity increased slowly after 6 h and recovered completely from the ketone inhibition after 12 h, suggesting that βHB and AcAc were either exported out of the cells or degraded or both. The concentrations of ketones in hepatocytes plated using high glucose conditions could not be measured accurately because the cells were not only incubated in high βHB concentrations but the hepatocytes also released ketone bodies rapidly upon washing. However, ketone levels in control hepatocytes incubated under low glucose conditions increased, whereas the concentrations of ketone bodies remained constant under high glucose conditions for at least 6 h. Because ketone bodies are also produced by the metabolism of fatty acid in liver, we investigated the effect of the addition of saturated fatty acids, stearate and palmitate, and unsaturated fatty acids, oleate and linoleate, on the nuclear/cytosol localization of GFP-ChREBP in hepatocytes. The results demonstrated that fatty acid metabolism also inhibited ChREBP nuclear localization with similar kinetics as those during starvation, reaching maximum inhibition within 3 h following addition of the saturated fatty acids (Fig. 6C), but the unsaturated fatty acids continued to inhibit the nuclear localization of ChREBP beyond 3 h. The rates and the amounts of βHB and AcAc produced by palmitate and oleate oxidation in hepatocytes were the same and correlated well with inhibition of nuclear localization of ChREBP (Fig. 6D). The differences in the extent of inhibition of the ChREBP activity observed between the saturated and unsaturated fatty acids suggest that the latter fatty acids had additional inhibitory effects on ChREBP, possibly involving denaturation of proteins and membranes. Because the rates of ChREBP nuclear export and ketone production by fatty acid oxidation correlate closely, we conclude that ketone bodies are responsible for the inhibition of ChREBP nuclear import. These in vivo and in vitro results are in total support of a role for βHB and AcAc in the inhibition of ChREBP nuclear localization in hepatocytes and suggest that this is a critical mechanism by which ChREBP is maintained as an inactive ChREBP(P)·14-3-3 complex in cytosol under low glucose conditions induced by starvation or induced by a high fat diet. We have demonstrated previously that 14-3-3 inhibits importin α binding to ChREBP directly at a “secondary or regulatory” site that overlaps a long bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) (13.Ge Q. Nakagawa T. Wynn R.M. Chook Y.M. Miller B.C. Uyeda K. Importin-α protein binding to a nuclear localization signal of carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP).J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 28119-28127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). It is possible that ketone bodies provide an additional stabilizing effect for ChREBP(P)/14-3-3 interactions while at the same time decreasing access of importin α to ChREBP, the first step in nuclear localization. To investigate this possibility, we used a pulldown assay to compare the effects of crude liver metabolite extracts from starved rats or rats fed different diets on importin α in the presence and the absence of 14-3-3β binding to ChREBP. The results shown in Fig. 7A (left panel) demonstrate that 14-3-3β binding to the secondary binding site of ChREBP (NLS-containing site) was completely dependent on the metabolite extract of the ST liver, partially activated by liver extracts prepared from the HF chow-fed rats, but completely inhibited by liver extracts prepared from the HS chow or NIH standard chow-fed rats. However, in the absence of 14-3-3β, the importin α binding was not inhibited significantly by the ST extract or the HF extract (Fig. 7A, right panel). These results strongly suggest that ketone bodies promote 14-3-3 binding to the regulatory site of ChREBP and promote ChREBP(P)/14-3-3 heterodimer formation. More importantly, there was an opposite effect of dietary conditions on the ChREBP/importin α interaction compared with ChREBP·14-3-3 complex formation. Importin α binding was activated by the HS and the NIH extracts and was inhibited almost completely by the ST extract and partially by the HF extract when both 14-3-3β and importin α were present. Thus, ChREBP·importin α and ChREBP·14-3-3 complex formation is inversely regulated by different diets, and these differences can be accounted for by differences in ketone body production in the liver. To confirm that ketone bodies in ST liver extracts are responsible for the reciprocal effects on ChREBP·importin α and ChREBP·14-3-3 complex formation, ST extract was subjected to additional HPLC analysis on a Synergi column (Fig. 7B), and the eluates were assayed for effects on both the ChREBP(P)/14-3-3 and ChREBP/importin α interactions. The results demonstrated that only two fractions, which contain βHB and AcAc, conferred the reciprocal effects (Fig. 7B). The ketone bodies in these fractions were identified as βHB in fraction 11 and AcAc in fraction 12 by the enzymatic assay using βHB dehydrogenase. In addition, standard βHB and AcAc were eluted in the same fractions under the identical conditions. This is further evidence that ketone bodies inhibit nuclear import by blocking importin α binding to the NLS of ChREBP as well as by promoting ChREBP(P)/14-3-3 interactions, thus resulting in cytosolic localization of ChREBP. Recently, we solved the crystal structure of 14-3-3β bound to its primary binding site on ChREBP, the α2-helix (amino acid residues 117–137), which occurs in a novel phosphate-independent manner. 14-3-3 also binds to the secondary binding site of ChREBP consisting of α3-helix (170–190), especially when a nearby residue Ser-196 is phosphorylated by PKA (8.Kawaguchi T. Takenoshita M. Kabashima T. Uyeda K. Glucose and cAMP regulate the L-type pyruvate kinase gene by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of the carbohydrate response element binding protein.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 13710-13715Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). This secondary binding site of 14-3-3 overlaps with NLS resulting in a competitive binding between 14-3-3 and importin α, and it serves as a regulatory site for nuclear/cytosol localization of ChREBP in response to glucose (25.Ge Q. Huang N. Wynn R.M. Li Y. Du X. Miller B. Zhang H. Uyeda K. Structural characterization of a unique interface between carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP) and 14-3-3β protein.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 41914-41921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In low glucose, 14-3-3 binds to both the primary and the secondary sites containing the nearby phosphorylated Ser(P)-196 and blocks importin α from binding to the NLS, thus promoting export, whereas under high glucose Ser-196 is dephosphorylated, which facilitates importin α binding and activates nuclear import of ChREBP. We suggest that the molecular mechanism for promotion of ChREBP(P)·14-3-3 complex formation is an allosteric activation induced by βHB binding at the interface between these two proteins, which further increases the affinity of ChREBP(P) and 14-3-3. ChREBP lacks conformation in isolation when in solution and is stabilized only by binding to the more rigid 14-3-3 proteins, which can be considered an example of “allosteric stabilization” (18.Gardino A.K. Smerdon S.J. Yaffe M.B. Structural determinants of 14-3-3 binding specificities and regulation of subcellular localization of 14-3-3-ligand complexes: a comparison of the x-ray crystal structures of all human 14-3-3 isoforms.Semin. Cancer Biol. 2006; 16: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the ChREBP(P)·14-3-3β complex revealed that the ChREBP α2-helix adopts an α-helical conformation and binds 14-3-3 in a unique phosphorylation-independent manner (25.Ge Q. Huang N. Wynn R.M. Li Y. Du X. Miller B. Zhang H. Uyeda K. Structural characterization of a unique interface between carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP) and 14-3-3β protein.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 41914-41921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The interaction involves both electrostatic and van der Waals interaction, and interestingly, the binding is also strengthened by anions such as free sulfate or phosphate present in the molecular structure of the crystals. Thus, small ligands such as β-HB may allosterically enhance the interaction between ChREBP and 14-3-3, which is supported by ITC measurements (Table 1). It is possible that monocarboxylate ions such as βHB and AcAc can bind to the same anion- binding site on the interface to enhance the binding and stabilization of the ChREBP(P)/14-3-3 heterodimer. Structural studies will be needed to determine precisely how βHB is bound to the ChREBP(P)·14-3-3 complex. In summary, we demonstrate that metabolites generated in animals fed specific diets or subjected to starvation alter gene expression patterns by directly affecting an unexpectedly simple signal transduction pathway. Ketone bodies produced during fasting or in animals fed a high fat diet inhibit lipogenesis by sequestering inactive ChREBP(P)/14-3-3 heterodimer in the cytosol and, at the same time, by inhibiting nuclear import by preventing importin α binding to ChREBP. Thus, ketone bodies are proposed to represent a “low glucose signal” that reciprocally regulates ChREBP signaling mediated by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation events induced by a high glucose signal.

Apoptosis of skeletal muscle precursor cells driven by TGFβ1 contributes to the negative role exerted by the cytokine in tissue repair, although the underlying molecular mechanisms are still elusive. Herein we report the identification of a new signaling pathway, relying on Rho kinase-2 stimulation, subsequent to SMAD-dependent S1P4 up-regulation and transactivation via sphingosine kinase (SK)-2, that accounts for TGFβ1-induced apoptosis in cultured myoblasts. S1P4-specific gene silencing reduced by almost 50% activation of caspase-3 and poly-ADP ribosyl transferase cleavage elicited by TGFβ1. Moreover, the selective S1P4 antagonist CYM50358 also reduced the TGFβ1 proapoptotic effects. By employing pharmacological and molecular biological approaches, the involvement of SK2 and ROCK2 in the transmission of the TGFβ1 apoptotic action was also demonstrated. These results reinforce the notion that the SK/S1P axis plays a fundamental role in TGFβ1 mode of action in skeletal muscle cells and, by disclosing a novel mechanism by which TGFβ1 exerts its harmful action, pinpoint new molecular targets that in principle could be beneficial in the treatment of several skeletal muscle disorders or aging-dependent muscle atrophy."

Circadian shedding of retinal photoreceptor cell discs with subsequent phagocytosis by the neighboring retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) is essential for removal of toxic metabolites and lifelong survival of these postmitotic neurons. Defects in photoreceptor phagocytosis can lead to severe retinal pathology, but the biochemical mechanisms remain poorly defined. By first documenting a 2.8-fold burst of photoreceptor phagocytosis events in the mouse eye in the morning compared with the afternoon by serial block face imaging, we established time points to assess transcriptional readouts by RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). We identified 365 oscillating protein-coding transcripts that implicated the phosphoinositide lipid signaling network mediating the discrete steps of photoreceptor phagocytosis. Moreover, examination of overlapping cistromic sites by core clock transcription factors and promoter elements of these effector genes provided a functional basis for the circadian cycling of these transcripts. RNA-Seq also revealed oscillating expression of 16 long intergenic noncoding RNAs and key histone modifying enzymes critical for circadian gene expression. Our phenotypic and genotypic characterization reveals a complex global landscape of overlapping and temporally controlled networks driving the essential circadian process in the eye."

SST-14, SST-28, and peptide analogs (octreotide, lanreotide, and vapreotide) stimulated clathrin- and dynamin-mediated internalization of SSTR2A, which colocalized with ECE-1 in endosomes and the Golgi. After incubation with SST-14, SSTR2A recycled to the plasma membrane, which required active ECE-1 and an intact Golgi. SSTR2A activated by SST-28, octreotide, lanreotide, or vapreotide was retained within the Golgi and did not recycle. Although ECE-1 rapidly degraded SST-14, SST-28 was resistant to degradation, and ECE-1 did not degrade SST analogs. SST-14 and SST-28 induced transient interactions between SSTR2A and β-arrestins that were stabilized by an ECE-1 inhibitor. Octreotide induced sustained SSTR2A/β-arrestin interactions that were not regulated by ECE-1. Thus, when activated by SST-14, SSTR2A internalizes and recycles via the Golgi, which requires ECE-1 degradation of SST-14 and receptor dissociation from β-arrestins. After activation by ECE-1-resistant SST-28 and analogs, SSTR2A remains in endosomes because of sustained β-arrestin interactions. Therapeutic SST analogs are ECE-1-resistant and retain SSTR2A in endosomes, which may explain their long-lasting actions.Background: Somatostatin regulates gut function via neuronal somatostatin receptors.Results: Somatostatin susceptibility to degradation by endosomal endothelin-converting enzyme 1 (ECE-1) defines receptor function.Conclusion: ECE-1 regulates the duration of somatostatin receptor signaling and trafficking.Significance: Therapeutic somatostatin analogs are ECE-1-resistant, which underlies their prolonged actions. Somatostatin (SST) 14 and SST 28 activate somatostatin 2A receptors (SSTR2A) on enteric neurons to control gut functions.

https://openalex.org/W2041979684,"Despite the progress made in targeted anticancer therapies in recent years, challenges remain. The identification of new potential targets will ensure that the arsenal of cancer therapies continues to expand. FAM83B was recently discovered in a forward genetic screen for novel oncogenes that drive human mammary epithelial cell (HMEC) transformation. We report here that elevated FAM83B expression increases Phospholipase D (PLD) activity, and that suppression of PLD1 activity prevents FAM83B-mediated transformation. The increased PLD activity is engaged by hyperactivation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which is regulated by an interaction involving FAM83B and EGFR. Preventing the FAM83B/EGFR interaction by site-directed mutation of lysine 230 of FAM83B suppressed PLD activity and MAPK signaling. Furthermore, ablation of FAM83B expression from breast cancer cells inhibited EGFR phosphorylation and suppressed cell proliferation. We propose that understanding the mechanism of FAM83B-mediated transformation will provide a foundation for future therapies aimed at targeting its function as an intermediary in EGFR, MAPK and mTOR activation."
https://openalex.org/W2101041156,"Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-13 is one of the mammalian collagenases that play key roles in tissue remodelling and repair and in progression of diseases such as cancer, arthritis, atherosclerosis, and aneurysm. For collagenase to cleave triple helical collagens, the triple helical structure has to be locally unwound before hydrolysis, but this process is not well understood. We report crystal structures of catalytically inactive full-length human MMP-13(E223A) in complex with peptides of 14–26 aa derived from the cleaved prodomain during activation. Peptides are bound to the active site of the enzyme by forming an extended β-strand with Glu40 or Tyr46 inserted into the S1′ specificity pocket. The structure of the N-terminal part of the peptides is variable and interacts with different parts of the catalytic domain. Those areas are designated substrate-dependent exosites, in that they accommodate different peptide structures, whereas the precise positioning of the substrate backbone is maintained in the active site. These modes of peptide-MMP-13 interactions have led us to propose how triple helical collagen strands fit into the active site cleft of the collagenase.—Stura, E.

Low light bioluminescence microscopy was employed to localize p21 expression to specific regions of the brain. Interestingly, p21 expression was observed in the paraventricular, arcuate, and dorsomedial nuclei of the hypothalamus, regions that detect nutrient levels in the blood stream and signal metabolic actions throughout the body. These results suggested a link between p21 expression and metabolic regulation.

Bioluminescence imaging demonstrated that fasting induced a 7-fold increase in p21 expression in livers of reporter mice and Western blotting demonstrated an increase in protein levels as well.

Conclusion: This study advances the role of p21 in metabolic stress response. Significance: Metabolic stress induces a cell cycle regulator even in non-dividing cells. The p21Waf1/CIP1 protein (hereafter called p21) is a cyclin-dependent protein kinase (CDK) 3The abbreviations used are: CDKcyclin-dependent kinaseBLIbioluminescence imagingFOXO1Forkhead Box O1FOXO3Forkhead Box O3KOknockoutNTN terminus. inhibitor that binds to cyclin-CDK complexes, as well as free CDKs, to inhibit cell cycle progression. Inhibition of cell cycle progression by p21 occurs during cell differentiation and in response to DNA damage and oxidative stress (2.Abbas T. Dutta A. p21 in cancer: intricate networks and multiple activities.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2009; 9: 400-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (1914) Google Scholar). Paradoxically, low levels of p21 positively regulate cell cycle progression by aiding in the assembly of stable CDK4-Cyclin D complexes. p21 also binds to and inhibits pro-apoptotic factors and binds to PCNA to regulate DNA replication and repair. Several signaling pathways impact the regulation of p21 at the level of transcriptional activation, mRNA elongation, and protein stability. cyclin-dependent kinase bioluminescence imaging Forkhead Box O1 Forkhead Box O3 knockout N terminus. Transcriptional regulation of the gene encoding p21, Cdkn1a (hereafter called p21), is controlled through many signaling pathways. The tumor suppressor protein p53 was one of the first transcription factors found to activate p21 transcription, particularly when cells are exposed to various forms of stress. While many upstream signals activate p21 through p53, there are a growing number of p53-independent mediators of p21 transcription. A subset of these p53-independent mechanisms includes Ras signaling through E2F1, nuclear receptors such as progesterone acting through their cognate response elements, and TGFβ through a complex containing SMAD3/4 and FOXO (3.Seoane J. Le H.V. Shen L. Anderson S.A. Massagué J. Integration of Smad and forkhead pathways in the control of neuroepithelial and glioblastoma cell proliferation.Cell. 2004; 117: 211-223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). To monitor upstream signaling pathways that specifically regulate p21 promoter activity, we previously generated and characterized reporter mice that enable noninvasive and repetitive imaging of p21 promoter activity in vivo using molecular imaging strategies (1.Tinkum K.L. Marpegan L. White L.S. Sun J. Herzog E.D. Piwnica-Worms D. Piwnica-Worms H. Bioluminescence imaging captures the expression and dynamics of endogenous p21 promoter activity in living mice and intact cells.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2011; 31: 3759-3772Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). p21 was ubiquitously expressed in reporter mice including in cells and organs that are relatively quiescent with respect to proliferation, such as hepatocytes and brain. In this study, low light bioluminescent imaging was employed to localize p21 expression to specific regions of the brain. Interestingly, bioluminescence was detected in the hypothalamus and in particular hypothalamic nuclei involved in metabolic regulation. This prompted us to examine p21 expression under conditions of short-term starvation (fasting). We report that p21 expression is robustly activated in several tissues in response to the metabolic stress induced by fasting, including metabolic organs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this stress response is independent of p53. Instead, FOXO1 was demonstrated to bind to the p21 promoter in the fasted, but not fed state, and to be necessary for activation of p21 expression during fasting. This study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments at Washington University approved all animal protocols used in this study. DNA sequences of the mouse p21 chromosome locus and its transcript were obtained from Ensembl Mouse Genome Database. PCR was utilized to amplify DNA encoding p21 from mouse 129/SvJ genomic DNA (Invitrogen). The 5′ arm was generated using primers 5′-GAT CCC CGG TCC TTG TGA A-3′ and 5′-CCA TGG TGC CTG TGG CTG AAA C-3′ to amplify 4.0 kb of p21 genomic DNA beginning within intron 1 and extending to immediately after the start codon in exon 2. The primer design inserted an NcoI site after the ATG start codon in exon 2. The second PCR reaction generated the 3′ arm using primers 5′-TGT CCG ACC TGT TCC GCA CAG-3′ and 5′-GGT AAG ACC AGG GAA TCC CAC-3′ to amplify 1.8 kb extending from inside exon 2 to the noncoding sequences downstream of exon 3. A modified version of pBigT was used as the backbone for inserting the 5′ and 3′ homologous arms and the Luciferase gene. pBigT contains a lox-P flanked PGK-NEO cassette (phosphoglycerate kinase promoter driving expression of neomycin phosphotransferase) and was modified with the sequence TAG TAA TGA C TAG TAA TGA C TAG TAA TGA between neomycin and the first poly(A) to provide three additional stop codons in each reading frame (pMBigT). The 4.0 kb BamHI/NcoI 5′ arm blunt fragment was cloned into SnaBI digested pMBigT. The 1.8 kb EcoRI/EcoRI 3′ arm blunt fragment was cloned into Asc I-digested pMBigT. A 1.6 kb NcoI/XbaI blunt fragment from pCBR (Promega) encoding Click Beetle Red Luciferase was cloned into NheI/SacI-digested pMBigT. Constructs were initially sequenced to confirm no point mutations and junctions were sequenced with each round of cloning. SSC10 ES cells (Siteman Cancer Center at Washington University) were electroporated with 13.4 kb Pac1 linearized targeting vector and selected with Geneticin (G418; Invitrogen) using established protocols (Siteman Cancer Murine Embryonic Stem Cell Core). A total of 144 G418-resistant ES colonies were analyzed for homologous recombination. Genomic DNA was digested with NdeI followed by Southern blotting with the 5′ probe (primers: Forward 5′-GCG ATA TCC AGA CAT TCA GAG-3′, Reverse 5′-GGA ATC CCT AGA AAC ATT GGC-3′) and with BglII/SphI followed by Southern blotting with the 3′ probe (primers: Forward 5′-CCA GTT GGG GTT CTC AGT GAC-3′, Reverse 5′-TCT CGT GAG ACG CTT ACA ATC-3′). The sizes of the WT and recombinant alleles probed with the 5′ probe were 10.5 kb and 15.0 kb, respectively, and with the 3′ probe were 8.5 kb and 5.9 kb, respectively. Four were positive for homologous recombination. ES cell clones #2, 4, 12, and 48 were karyotyped and clones #2 and 4 were microinjected into C57BL/6 blastocysts and subsequently implanted into the uteri of pseudopregnant C57BL/6 x C3H foster mothers. Male chimeras were selected by percentage of agouti color and were mated to C57BL/6 females. Germ line transmission was determined by agouti coat color. Progeny from ES clone #2 were selected for further propagation. F1 animals were tested for the targeted p21 allele by PCR analysis of tail DNA. PCR analysis was performed with three primers (A: 5′-TCT TGT GTT TCA GCC ACA GGC-3′, B: 5′-CTG TCA GGC TGG TCT GCC TCC-3′, C: 5′-TGC TAA AGC GCA TGC TCC AGA C-3′). The sizes of the WT and recombinant alleles were 453 and 160, respectively, when probed with primers A, B, and C. In the recombinant locus, we knocked-in the CBRLuciferase gene into the endogenous p21 locus; however, CBRLuciferase was not expressed, as it is downstream of 3 stop codons in each reading frame. The mice were crossed with transgenic mice expressing Cre under control of the Albumin promoter (4.Postic C. Magnuson M.A. DNA excision in liver by an albumin-Cre transgene occurs progressively with age.Genesis. 2000; 26: 149-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). To confirm Cre-mediated excision of the stop codon, DNA was isolated from livers and PCR analysis was performed with four primers (A-C above and D: 5′-CTA ACG ACG TCG TTC ATC TTG T-3′). The sizes of the WT, recombinant pre-Cre-mediated excision and recombinant post-Cre-mediated excision were 453, 160 and 350, respectively, when probed with primers A, B, C, and D. Unless otherwise stated, equivalent numbers of male and female mice at 4–6 weeks of age were used. p21+/FLucmice were previously published (1.Tinkum K.L. Marpegan L. White L.S. Sun J. Herzog E.D. Piwnica-Worms D. Piwnica-Worms H. Bioluminescence imaging captures the expression and dynamics of endogenous p21 promoter activity in living mice and intact cells.Mol. Cell.

Albumin-Cre mice were provided by Dr. Shin Imai and FOXO1 floxed mice were provided by Dr. Ronald DePinho. Wild type mice used in the studies were littermates of p21+/FLuc mice on the B6-albino background. All experimental mice were housed singly on aspen bedding. BLI was performed as previously published for studies carried out in vivo and ex vivo (1.Tinkum K.L. Marpegan L. White L.S. Sun J. Herzog E.D. Piwnica-Worms D. Piwnica-Worms H.

Livers isolated from p21+/Fluc and p21FLuc/FLuc mice were flash frozen. Livers were thawed followed by homogenization in mammalian cell lysis buffer (MCLB (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm DTT, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm microcystin (Sigma), 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm PMSF)) supplemented with 1 mm sodium fluoride, protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma) and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Calbiochem). Clarified lysates were resolved directly by SDS-PAGE (10%/15% layered SDS gel) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for Western blotting. Membranes were blocked in TBST (20 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% nonfat milk and incubated overnight in primary antibody diluted in TBST/1% nonfat milk. Membranes were washed in TBST, incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h in TBST/1% nonfat milk, and washed again in TBST. Membranes were incubated with ECL (Pierce) and analyzed using a GelDoc Imaging System (Bio-Rad). Primary antibodies included anti-p21 at 1:1000 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, F5), and anti-Actin at 1:10,000 (Sigma, A4700). Secondary antibodies were HRP-conjugated, AffiniPure goat anti-mouse (Jackson). Male and female p21+/FLuc mice were allowed to feed ad libitum or were fasted for 24 h. Mice were sacrificed and brains were isolated. Isolated brains were placed in ice cold Hanks-buffered Saline Solution (HBSS, pH 7.4) (Sigma) and cut into 200 μm sections on a vibratome (immersed in HBSS maintained at 4 °C). Three brain slices containing the hypothalamus at −0.58 mm, −1.82 mm, and −1.94 mm Bregma were placed on separate organotypic Millicell culture inserts (Millipore) in a 35-mm Petri dish containing HEPES-buffered DMEM supplemented with B27 (Invitrogen), 0.1 μm d-luciferin (BioThema), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). All images were initiated within 45 min of organ isolation. To allow for imaging multiple tissues from within one mouse, three low light imaging systems were utilized and kept consistent for each region: a Versarray back-thinned illuminated CCD camera (Princeton Instruments), and an iXon DU-897E EM CCD camera (Andor Technology), each coupled to TE-2000 Nikon inverted microscopes were equipped with custom light tight environmental chambers (InVivo Scientific) that prevented light leaks and allowed maintenance of a constant temperature of 37 °C, or in a light tight box with an intensified CCD camera (XR/Mega-10Z; Stanford Photonics Inc.)

Image processing of target regions identified by comparison to a mouse brain atlas (6.Paxions G. Franklin K.B.J. The Mouse Brain in Stereotatic Coordinates. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, 2001Google Scholar) was performed with ImageJ software (7.Abramoff M.D. Magelhaes P.J. Ram S.J. Image processing with Image J.Biophotonics Int. 2004; 11: 36-42Google Scholar) and included subtraction of a background image, removal of random bright spots (using despeckle filtering algorirthm, ImageJ) and adjusting the brightness and contrast equally across the entire image. Intensity scale ramps were scaled and normalized to the time over which the image was acquired and are represented as RLU/minute. Pseudocolored images were generated using the RainbowRGB look-up table (LUT) on the bioluminescence image. ROIs were analyzed using ImageJ and were normalized as target region to non-target region. Brains were dissected from p21+/+ or p21FLuc/FLuc mice, sliced coronally into three sections using a coronal brain tissue matrix, immediately frozen in optimal cutting temperature (OCT, TissueTek) compound, and stored at −80 °C. 30 μm sections ranging from Bregma −0.58 to −0.82 mm (paraventricular nucleus) and from Bregma −1.70 mm to −1.94 mm (arcuate nucleus and dorsomedial hypothalamus) were cut coronally on a cryostat and sections were placed on PEN membrane slides (Leica). Unstained slides were stored in a desiccator at −80 °C. Tissue-mounted slides were fixed in 100% ethanol (30 s), rehydrated in ethanol (95, 75, 50%) for 30 s each, stained in 1% Crystal Violet (Sigma Co) in RNase-free water (1 min) and dehydrated in ethanol (50, 75, 95, 100, and 100%) for 30 s each. Slides were rinsed in xylene and dried in a desiccator for at least 5 min immediately prior to laser capture microdissection. Sections were dissected using the Leica LMD7000 laser capture microdissection system. RNA was isolated from laser capture microdissected tissue using the RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen). Isolated RNA was treated with DNaseI (Qiagen and Ambion) and quality of RNA was determined by chip electrophoresis (Bio-Rad) and only high quality samples were analyzed. RNA was reverse-transcribed using the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems). Real-time PCR of laser-captured samples was performed as previously reported (1.Tinkum K.L.

Livers of p21+/+ mice were perfused with PBS containing 50 ng/ml heparin followed by PBS containing 1% formaldehyde. Livers were incubated in PBS/1% formaldehyde for 5 min, dissected, and incubated at 30 °C for 5 min. Crosslinking was halted by the addition of ice-cold glycine. Hepatocytes were isolated by mincing the liver, manually disrupting the tissue between 2 frosted slides, passing mixture through a 70-μm filter and centrifuging flow through for 5 min at 50 × g. Hepatocytes were resuspended in nuclear lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 μm EDTA, 1% SDS in ddH2O with Protease Inhibitor cocktail (Roche)), and sonicated 30 times (30 s on, 60 s off) at 60% amplitude. Cleared lysates were diluted in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium dodecylsulfate, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate), pre-cleared with Dynal beads (Invitrogen), and incubated overnight with FOXO1 antibody (gift from Anne Brunet) or IgG (Invitrogen) coated Dynal beads (5 μg/50 μl beads in 1 ml of PBS supplemented with 5 mg/ml BSA) rocking at 4 °C. Precipitates were washed sequentially with Low Salt Wash Buffer (once), High Salt Wash Buffer (twice), LiCl Buffer (3 times), and TE Buffer (twice) (Upstate), followed by elution in a 1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3 buffer at 65 °C for 2 h. Eluates were incubated at 65 °C overnight followed by phenol-chloroform extraction and PCR cleanup (Qiagen). PCR was performed with 2× Brilliant PCR Mix (Agilent), containing 250 nm of each primer and 1 μl of 1:50 diluted chromatin immunoprecipitation sample in a Applied Biosystem Venti 96-well Thermal-Cycler (95 °C 10 min, then 35 cycles of 95 °C 30 s, 63 °C 1 min, 72 °C 30 s, followed by 72 °C 4 min). PCR products were analyzed on a 2% agarose gel. PCR primers were as follows: FHB forward primer: CCTGGAGGCCAAGGGGATTTGG; FHB reverse primer: CAG GGG CCA GCA CAG GAT GTC A; Distal fwd: TGG GCA GCT TGC CAG AGG TC; Distal rev: AGC CGC CAG GCT CCT TAC CT. Plasma was isolated from 5-week-old male p21+/+ and p21FLuc/FLuc littermates that had been allowed to feed ad libitum and from the same mice 1 week later after a 24 h fast. 100 μl of heparinized blood was centrifuged and plasma was isolated. Total triglycerides, cholesterol, glucose, and free fatty acids were quantified using previously published protocols (10.Marshall B.A. Tordjman K. Host H.H. Ensor N.J. Kwon G. Marshall C.A.

Triglycerides, cholesterol, and glucose were measured using Infinity reagents (Thermo Scientific), and free fatty acids were measured using reagents provided by Wako Chemicals. 4–6-week-old p21+/+ and p21FLuc/FLuc male littermates were allowed to feed ad libitum or were fasted for 24 h. Livers were isolated, weighed, and flash frozen. Glycogen was analyzed according to recommendations of the manufacturer (Abcam). pCMV5 encoding HA-FOXO1 (plasmid 12142) and Flag-pCMV5 encoding the N terminus of FOXO3 (FOXO3NT, plasmid 14938) were purchased from Addgene. PCR reactions were carried out to add 5′ Xho1 and 3′ HindIII restriction sites to each cDNA using the following 5′-CCATGGACTACAAGGACGAC and 5′-ACTGGGGAGGGGTCACAG. Reaction products were sequenced and cDNAs were cloned into XhoI/HindIII digested pAdTrack. Recombinant adenoviruses were generated using the pAdEasy protocol (11.He T.-C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J.

Photon flux was measured at baseline, and recombinant adenovirus encoding FOXO3NT or FOXO1WT was delivered by tail vein injection of 5 × 1010 viral particles per 4–6-week-old mouse. BLI was measured 3, 6, and 9 days postinjection and mice were fasted for 24 h at 9 days postinjection. Livers were isolated after 24 h of fasting, fixed, frozen in OCT, and 5 μm sections were analyzed to determine efficiency of viral infection by quantification of the percent of GFP-positive cells within 5 fields of view. We previously reported the generation and characterization of knock-in reporter mice that enable endogenous Cdkn1a (hereafter, p21) promoter activity to be monitored dynamically using bioluminescence imaging (BLI) (1.Tinkum K.L. Marpegan L. White L.S. Sun J. Herzog E.D. Piwnica-Worms D. Piwnica-Worms H. Bioluminescence imaging captures the expression and dynamics of endogenous p21 promoter activity in living mice and intact cells.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2011; 31: 3759-3772Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). p21+/FLuc reporter mice express firefly luciferase (FLuc) cDNA under control of the endogenous p21 promoter. We detected p21 promoter activity in most organs of the mouse, including the brain. To localize p21 promoter activity within specific regions of the brain, live brain slices were imaged ex vivo using low light microscopy (5.Marpegan L. Swanstrom A.E. Chung K. Simon T. Haydon P.G. Khan S.K. Liu A.C. Herzog E.D. Beaulé C. Circadian regulation of ATP release in astrocytes.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 8342-8350Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Brains were isolated from p21+/FLuc mice, placed in buffers to maintain viability, immediately sectioned, then bathed in media containing d-luciferin. p21 promoter activity was localized to several hypothalamic nuclei, including the paraventricular, arcuate, periventricular, and dorsomedial nuclei (Fig. 1). These regions of the hypothalamus are involved in modulating stress, hunger, and whole body metabolic homeostasis. Given that p21 was specifically expressed in regions of the hypothalamus involved in metabolic regulation, we asked if fasting modulated p21 expression. p21+/FLuc littermates were allowed to feed ad libitum or were fasted for 48 h. Mice were subjected to whole-body BLI at baseline and after 24 and 48 h of fasting. As seen in Fig. 2 (panels A and B), p21 promoter activity in mice fasted for 24 h was 8-fold higher than that in fed littermates and rose to 13-fold higher in mice fasted for 48 h. As seen in Fig. 2 (panels C and D), fasting induced p21 expression in several mouse organs and differences between fed and fasted states reached statistical significance in liver, pancreas, brain, lung, salivary gland, heart, kidney, and bladder. To determine if increased p21 promoter activity led to a corresponding increase in endogenous p21 protein, lysates were prepared from livers of fed and fasted p21+/FLuc mice, and p21 was analyzed by Western blotting. As seen in Fig. 2E, endogenous p21 protein was higher in livers of fasted mice compared with livers of fed littermates. Thus, fasting induced p21 expression and led to an increase in p21 protein in liver. To obtain a more uniform genetic background for metabolic studies, p21+/FLuc reporter mice (of the mixed background 129/SvJ and C57BL/6J) were backcrossed to Albino-B6 (B6(Cg)-Tyrc-2J/J) mice for at least 3 generations. Albino-B6 mice are derivatives of C57BL/6J mice that carry a mutant Tyrosinase gene resulting in a white coat color, enabling enhanced sensitivity for detecting bioluminescence in vivo. Inbred progeny obtained after 3 rounds of backcrossing died if they were fasted for 48 h, so all subsequent fasting experiments performed in this study were performed for 24 h. We next asked if fasting increased p21 expression in the paraventricular, arcuate, periventricular, and dorsomedial nuclei of the hypothalamus. Brains were isolated from mice that had been allowed to feed ad libitum or that had been fasted for 24 h. Brains were subjected to coronal sectioning in buffers that maintained tissue viability. Brain sections through the hypothalamus at Bregma −0.58, −1.82, and −1.94 were bathed in media containing d-luciferin and bioluminescence was detected using low-light imaging (LLI) microscopy. Within each section, photon output was quantified from the known location of the target region and normalized to a non-target region to control for background (Figs. 3, A and B). Fasting resulted in a trend toward increased bioluminescence within each nucleus, although differences between fed and fasted states did not reach significance. To test the p21 response in an independent assay, we performed laser-capture microdissection followed by real-time, quantitative PCR (Fig. 3C). Results confirmed that endogenous p21 mRNA increased in the paraventricular nucleus, arcuate nucleus, and dorsomedial hypothalamus in fasted mice compared with fed littermates. Because of technical limitations, we were unable to measure p21 mRNA levels in periventricular nuclei. Together, these data demonstrate that fasting increases p21 expression in the metabolic regulatory regions of the hypothalamus. To monitor tissue-specific and temporal regulation of p21 expression in individual mouse tissues, knock-in mice that conditionally express click beetle (Pyrophorus plagiophthalamus) red luciferase (CBRLuc) under the control of the endogenous p21 promoter were generated (Fig. 4A). Successful homologous recombination of the conditional p21-CBRLuc targeting vector in ES cell clones was confirmed by Southern blotting (Fig. 4, B and C). PCR analysis of tail DNA confirmed the expected recombination within the p21 locus (Fig. 4D). To examine p21 promoter activity specifically within hepatocytes, conditional floxed stop p21-CBRLuc (p21f/+) reporter mice were crossed with transgenic mice expressing Cre under the control of the albumin promoter (hereafter, Alb-Cre+) (4.Postic C. Magnuson M.A. DNA excision in liver by an albumin-Cre transgene occurs progressively with age.Genesis. 2000; 26: 149-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) to generate Alb-Cre+; p21f/+ mice (hereafter p21Liv-Luc/+). Liver-specific expression was chosen because of the primary role that the liver plays in regulating systemic metabolism. PCR analysis of liver DNA demonstrated Cre-mediated recombination of the p21 allele (Fig. 4E). Importantly, bioluminescence was detected in the abdominal region of p21Liv-Luc/+ mice but not in littermates lacking the Albumin-Cre allele (hereafter, p21f/+) (Fig. 4F) and ex vivo BLI c"

Here, we provide evidence for the pathways that control the specific expression of GalNAc moieties on human CD4+ T cells. GalNAc epitopes were readily detectable on the cell surface after T cell activation and required de novo protein synthesis. Expression of GalNAc-containing MGL ligands was completely dependent on PKC and did not involve NF-κB.

https://openalex.org/W2031452060,"Increased endothelin-1 (ET-1) levels, disordered thiol protein status, and erythrocyte hydration status play important roles in sickle cell disease (SCD) through unresolved mechanisms. Protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) is an oxidoreductase that mediates thiol/disulfide interchange reactions. We provide evidence that PDI is present in human and mouse erythrocyte membranes and that selective blockade with monoclonal antibodies against PDI leads to reduced Gardos channel activity (1.6±0.03 to 0.56±0.02 mmol·10(13) cell(-1)·min(-1), P<0.001) and density of sickle erythrocytes (D50: 1.115±0.001 to 1.104±0.001 g/ml, P=0.012) with an IC50 of 4 ng/ml. We observed that erythrocyte associated-PDI activity was increased in the presence of ET-1 (3.1±0.2 to 5.6±0.4%, P<0.0001) through a mechanism that includes casein kinase II. Consistent with these results, in vivo treatment of BERK sickle transgenic mice with ET-1 receptor antagonists lowered circulating and erythrocyte associated-PDI activity (7.1±0.3 to 5.2±0.2%, P<0.0001) while improving hematological parameters and Gardos channel activity. Thus, our results suggest that PDI is a novel target in SCD that regulates erythrocyte volume and oxidative stress and may contribute to cellular adhesion and endothelial activation leading to vasoocclusion as observed in SCD."
https://openalex.org/W2071327722,"In eukaryotic organisms, cysteine palmitoylation is an important reversible modification that impacts protein targeting, folding, stability, and interactions with partners. Evidence suggests that protein palmitoylation contributes to key biological processes in Apicomplexa with the recent palmitome of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum reporting over 400 substrates that are modified with palmitate by a broad range of protein S-acyl transferases. Dynamic palmitoylation cycles require the action of an acyl-protein thioesterase (APT) that cleaves palmitate from substrates and conveys reversibility to this posttranslational modification. In this work, we identified candidates for APT activity in Toxoplasma gondii. Treatment of parasites with low micromolar concentrations of β-lactone- or triazole urea-based inhibitors that target human APT1 showed varied detrimental effects at multiple steps of the parasite lytic cycle. The use of an activity-based probe in combination with these inhibitors revealed the existence of several serine hydrolases that are targeted by APT1 inhibitors. The active serine hydrolase, TgASH1, identified as the homologue closest to human APT1 and APT2, was characterized further. Biochemical analysis of TgASH1 indicated that this enzyme cleaves substrates with a specificity similar to APTs, and homology modeling points toward an APT-like enzyme. TgASH1 is dispensable for parasite survival, which indicates that the severe effects observed with the β-lactone inhibitors are caused by the inhibition of non-TgASH1 targets. Other ASH candidates for APT activity were functionally characterized, and one of them was found to be resistant to gene disruption due to the potential essential nature of the protein."
https://openalex.org/W1977098850,"The role of clathrin-coated vesicles in receptor-mediated endocytosis is conserved among eukaryotes, and many of the proteins required for clathrin coat assembly and disassembly have orthologs in yeast and mammals. In yeast, dozens of proteins have been identified as regulators of the multistep reaction required for endocytosis, including those that regulate disassembly of the clathrin coat. In mammalian systems, clathrin coat disassembly has been reconstituted using neuronal clathrin baskets mixed with the purified chaperone ATPase 70-kDa heat shock cognate (Hsc70), plus a clathrin-specific co-chaperone, such as the synaptic protein auxilin. Yet, despite previous characterization of the yeast Hsc70 ortholog, Ssa1p, and the auxilin-like ortholog, Swa2p, testing mechanistic models for disassembly of nonneuronal clathrin coats has been limited by the absence of a functional reconstitution assay. Here we use single-particle burst analysis spectroscopy, in combination with fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, to follow the population dynamics of fluorescently tagged yeast clathrin baskets in the presence of purified Ssa1p and Swa2p. An advantage of this combined approach for mechanistic studies is the ability to measure, as a function of time, changes in the number and size of objects from a starting population to the reaction products. Our results indicate that Ssa1p and Swa2p cooperatively disassemble yeast clathrin baskets into fragments larger than the individual triskelia, suggesting that disassembly of clathrin-coated vesicles may proceed through a partially uncoated intermediate."
https://openalex.org/W2065294113,"Listeria monocytogenes is adaptable to low pH environments and therefore crosses the intestinal barrier to establish systemic infections. L. monocytogenes aguA1 and aguA2 encode putative agmatine deiminases (AgDIs) AguA1 and AguA2. Transcription of aguA1 and aguA2 was significantly induced at pH 5.0. Deletion of aguA1 significantly impaired its survival both in gastric fluid at pH 2.5 and in mouse stomach, whereas aguA2 deletion did not show significant defect of survival in gastric fluid. With agmatine as the sole substrate, AguA1 expressed in Escherichia coli was optimal at 25 °C and over a wide range of pH from 3.5 to 10.5. Recombinant AguA2 showed no deiminase activity. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that all nine AguA1 mutants completely lost enzymatic activity. AguA2 acquired AgDI activity only when Cys-157 was mutated to glycine. AguA1 mutation at the same site, G157C, also inactivated the enzyme. Thus, we have discovered Gly-157 as a novel residue other than the known catalytic triad (Cys-His-Glu/Asp) in L. monocytogenes that is critical for enzyme activity. Of the two putative AgDIs, we conclude that only AguA1 functionally participates in the AgDI pathway and mediates acid tolerance in L. monocytogenes."
https://openalex.org/W2030612939,"Phospholipase C (Plc1p) is required for the initial step of inositol polyphosphate (InsP) synthesis, and yeast cells with deletion of the PLC1 gene are completely devoid of any InsPs and display aberrations in transcriptional regulation. Here we show that Plc1p is required for a normal level of histone acetylation; plc1Δ cells that do not synthesize any InsPs display decreased acetylation of bulk histones and global hypoacetylation of chromatin histones. In accordance with the role of Plc1p in supporting histone acetylation, plc1Δ mutation is synthetically lethal with mutations in several subunits of SAGA and NuA4 histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complexes. Conversely, the growth rate, sensitivity to multiple stresses, and the transcriptional defects of plc1Δ cells are partially suppressed by deletion of histone deacetylase HDA1. The histone hypoacetylation in plc1Δ cells is due to the defect in degradation of repressor Mth1p, and consequently lower expression of HXT genes and reduced conversion of glucose to acetyl-CoA, a substrate for HATs. The histone acetylation and transcriptional defects can be partially suppressed and the overall fitness improved in plc1Δ cells by increasing the cellular concentration of acetyl-CoA. Together, our data indicate that Plc1p and InsPs are required for normal acetyl-CoA homeostasis, which, in turn, regulates global histone acetylation."
https://openalex.org/W2031108898,"Reconstructing the phylogenetic relationships of the main evolutionary lines of the mammalian peroxidases lactoperoxidase and myeloperoxidase revealed the presence of novel bacterial heme peroxidase subfamilies. Here, for the first time, an ancestral bacterial heme peroxidase is shown to possess a very high bromide oxidation activity (besides conventional peroxidase activity). The recombinant protein allowed monitoring of the autocatalytic peroxide-driven formation of covalent heme to protein bonds. Thereby, the high spin ferric rhombic heme spectrum became similar to lactoperoxidase, the standard reduction potential of the Fe(III)/Fe(II) couple shifted to more positive values (-145 ± 10 mV at pH 7), and the conformational and thermal stability of the protein increased significantly. We discuss structure-function relationships of this new peroxidase in relation to its mammalian counterparts and ask for its putative physiological role."
https://openalex.org/W2052638109,"The AAA-type ATPase Vps4 functions with components of the ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required for transport) machinery in membrane fission events that are essential for endosomal maturation, cytokinesis, and the formation of retroviruses. A key step in these events is the assembly of monomeric Vps4 into the active ATPase complex, which is aided in part by binding of Vps4 via its N-terminal MIT (microtubule interacting and trafficking) domain to its substrate ESCRT-III. We found that the 40-amino acid linker region between the MIT and the ATPase domain of Vps4 is not required for proper function but plays a role in regulating Vps4 assembly and ATPase activity. Deletion of the linker is expected to bring the MIT domains into close proximity to the central pore of the Vps4 complex. We propose that this localization of the MIT domain in linker-deleted Vps4 mimics a repositioning of the MIT domain normally caused by binding of Vps4 to ESCRT-III. This structure would allow the Vps4 complex to engage ESCRT-III subunits with both the pore and the MIT domain simultaneously, which might be essential for the ATP-driven disassembly of ESCRT-III."
https://openalex.org/W2075006581,"The bacterial transcription elongation factor, NusA, functions as an antiterminator when it is bound to the lambdoid phage derived antiterminator protein, N. The mode of N-NusA interaction is unknown, knowledge of which is essential to understand the antitermination process. It was reported earlier that in the absence of the transcription elongation complex (EC), N interacts with the C-terminal AR1 domain of NusA. However, the functional significance of this interaction is obscure. Here we identified mutations in NusA N terminus (NTD) specifically defective for N-mediated antitermination. These are located at a convex surface of the NusA-NTD, situated opposite its concave RNA polymerase (RNAP) binding surface. These NusA mutants disrupt the N-nut site interactions on the nascent RNA emerging out of a stalled EC. In the N/NusA-modified EC, a Cys-53 (S53C) from the convex surface of the NusA-NTD forms a specific disulfide (S-S) bridge with a Cys-39 (S39C) of the NusA binding region of the N protein. We conclude that when bound to the EC, the N interaction surface of NusA shifts from the AR1 domain to its NTD domain. This occurred due to a massive away-movement of the adjacent AR2 domain of NusA upon binding to the EC. We propose that the close proximity of this altered N-interaction site of NusA to its RNAP binding surface, enables N to influence the NusA-RNAP interaction during transcription antitermination that in turn facilitates the conversion of NusA into an antiterminator."
