https://openalex.org/W2159715390,"Prostate cancer is the second most common cause of male cancer deaths in the United States. However, the full range of prostate cancer genomic alterations is incompletely characterized. Here we present the complete sequence of seven primary human prostate cancers and their paired normal counterparts. Several tumours contained complex chains of balanced (that is, ‘copy-neutral’) rearrangements that occurred within or adjacent to known cancer genes. Rearrangement breakpoints were enriched near open chromatin, androgen receptor and ERG DNA binding sites in the setting of the ETS gene fusion TMPRSS2–ERG, but inversely correlated with these regions in tumours lacking ETS fusions. This observation suggests a link between chromatin or transcriptional regulation and the genesis of genomic aberrations. Three tumours contained rearrangements that disrupted CADM2, and four harboured events disrupting either PTEN (unbalanced events), a prostate tumour suppressor, or MAGI2 (balanced events), a PTEN interacting protein not previously implicated in prostate tumorigenesis. Thus, genomic rearrangements may arise from transcriptional or chromatin aberrancies and engage prostate tumorigenic mechanisms. Prostate cancer is a common cause of male cancer-related deaths. Complete genome sequencing of seven 'high-risk' primary prostate cancers and their paired normal counterparts now reveals previously unknown balanced rearrangements, at which multiple intra- and inter-chromosomal loci exchange their breakpoint arms without any loss of genetic material. The anomalies seem to arise through errors in transcription or abnormal chromatin structure, and genes affected include the known prostate tumour suppressor PTEN as well as MAG12, a gene not previously implicated in prostate tumorigenesis. Prostate cancer is a common cause of male cancer-related deaths. Complete sequencing of prostate cancer genomes now reveals previously unknown balanced rearrangements. Single-nucleotide resolution afforded by sequencing indicates that complex rearrangements may arise from transcriptional or chromatin aberrancies and engage prostate tumorigenic mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2030658020,"The RNA-binding protein Staufen1 (STAU1) promotes the degradation of double-stranded messenger RNA in the process known as Staufen-mediated decay (SMD). STAU1 binds to transcripts in the 3′ untranslated region (UTR), and although a specific stem-loop binding site had been defined for one SMD target, it was unclear how STAU1 was directed to other SMD targets that lack this structure. Chenguang Gong and Lynne Maquat report that pairing of Alu element sequences in long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and in the 3′ UTR of the SMD target generates a double-stranded RNA structure that STAU1 recognizes. This result highlights a new function for lncRNAs. Staufen 1 (STAU1) protein binds regions of dsRNA in the 3′ UTR of mRNAs and promotes their degradation, a process known as SMD (Staufen-mediated mRNA decay). Although a specific stem-loop binding site had been defined for one SMD target, it was unclear how STAU1 was directed to other SMD targets that lack this structure. This paper reports that pairing of Alu element sequences in long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and in the 3′ UTR of the SMD target generates a dsRNA structure that STAU1 recognizes. This result highlights a new function for lncRNAs. Staufen 1 (STAU1)-mediated messenger RNA decay (SMD) involves the degradation of translationally active mRNAs whose 3′-untranslated regions (3′ UTRs) bind to STAU1, a protein that binds to double-stranded RNA1,2. Earlier studies defined the STAU1-binding site within ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1) mRNA as a 19-base-pair stem with a 100-nucleotide apex2. However, we were unable to identify comparable structures in the 3′ UTRs of other targets of SMD. Here we show that STAU1-binding sites can be formed by imperfect base-pairing between an Alu element in the 3′ UTR of an SMD target and another Alu element in a cytoplasmic, polyadenylated long non-coding RNA (lncRNA). An individual lncRNA can downregulate a subset of SMD targets, and distinct lncRNAs can downregulate the same SMD target. These are previously unappreciated functions of non-coding RNAs and Alu elements3,4,5. Not all mRNAs that contain an Alu element in the 3′ UTR are targeted for SMD even in the presence of a complementary lncRNA that targets other mRNAs for SMD. Most known trans-acting RNA effectors consist of fewer than 200 nucleotides, and these include small nucleolar RNAs and microRNAs. Our finding that the binding of STAU1 to mRNAs can be transactivated by lncRNAs uncovers an unexpected strategy that cells use to recruit proteins to mRNAs and mediate the decay of these mRNAs. We name these lncRNAs half-STAU1-binding site RNAs (1/2-sbsRNAs)."
https://openalex.org/W2124098526,"Telomere dysfunction activates p53-mediated cellular growth arrest, senescence and apoptosis to drive progressive atrophy and functional decline in high-turnover tissues. The broader adverse impact of telomere dysfunction across many tissues including more quiescent systems prompted transcriptomic network analyses to identify common mechanisms operative in haematopoietic stem cells, heart and liver. These unbiased studies revealed profound repression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, coactivator 1 alpha and beta (PGC-1α and PGC-1β, also known as Ppargc1a and Ppargc1b, respectively) and the downstream network in mice null for either telomerase reverse transcriptase (Tert) or telomerase RNA component (Terc) genes. Consistent with PGCs as master regulators of mitochondrial physiology and metabolism, telomere dysfunction is associated with impaired mitochondrial biogenesis and function, decreased gluconeogenesis, cardiomyopathy, and increased reactive oxygen species. In the setting of telomere dysfunction, enforced Tert or PGC-1α expression or germline deletion of p53 (also known as Trp53) substantially restores PGC network expression, mitochondrial respiration, cardiac function and gluconeogenesis. We demonstrate that telomere dysfunction activates p53 which in turn binds and represses PGC-1α and PGC-1β promoters, thereby forging a direct link between telomere and mitochondrial biology. We propose that this telomere-p53-PGC axis contributes to organ and metabolic failure and to diminishing organismal fitness in the setting of telomere dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2012254260,"To mark the tenth anniversary of the publication reporting a draft sequence of the human genome by the Human Genome Project, this issue of Nature presents three major papers about human genomics. Eric Lander, present at the birth of the Human Genome Project, looks back at what has been achieved in genomics and speculates on future prospects. Elaine Mardis discusses the DNA sequencing technologies that have catalysed the rapid genomic advances over the past ten years. And Eric Green, Mark Guyer and others from the US National Human Genome Research Institute provide a vision for the future of genomic medicine. There has been much progress in genomics in the ten years since a draft sequence of the human genome was published. Opportunities for understanding health and disease are now unprecedented, as advances in genomics are harnessed to obtain robust foundational knowledge about the structure and function of the human genome and about the genetic contributions to human health and disease. Here we articulate a 2011 vision for the future of genomics research and describe the path towards an era of genomic medicine."

https://openalex.org/W2137155095,"Electrical stimulation of certain hypothalamic regions in cats and rodents can elicit attack behaviour, but the exact location of relevant cells within these regions, their requirement for naturally occurring aggression and their relationship to mating circuits have not been clear. Genetic methods for neural circuit manipulation in mice provide a potentially powerful approach to this problem, but brain-stimulation-evoked aggression has never been demonstrated in this species. Here we show that optogenetic, but not electrical, stimulation of neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus, ventrolateral subdivision (VMHvl) causes male mice to attack both females and inanimate objects, as well as males. Pharmacogenetic silencing of VMHvl reversibly inhibits inter-male aggression. Immediate early gene analysis and single unit recordings from VMHvl during social interactions reveal overlapping but distinct neuronal subpopulations involved in fighting and mating. Neurons activated during attack are inhibited during mating, suggesting a potential neural substrate for competition between these opponent social behaviours."
https://openalex.org/W2026404421,"Individuals with congenital or acquired prolongation of the QT interval, or long QT syndrome (LQTS), are at risk of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia. LQTS is commonly genetic in origin but can also be caused or exacerbated by environmental factors. A missense mutation in the L-type calcium channel Ca(V)1.2 leads to LQTS in patients with Timothy syndrome. To explore the effect of the Timothy syndrome mutation on the electrical activity and contraction of human cardiomyocytes, we reprogrammed human skin cells from Timothy syndrome patients to generate induced pluripotent stem cells, and differentiated these cells into cardiomyocytes. Electrophysiological recording and calcium (Ca(2+)) imaging studies of these cells revealed irregular contraction, excess Ca(2+) influx, prolonged action potentials, irregular electrical activity and abnormal calcium transients in ventricular-like cells. We found that roscovitine, a compound that increases the voltage-dependent inactivation of Ca(V)1.2 (refs 6-8), restored the electrical and Ca(2+) signalling properties of cardiomyocytes from Timothy syndrome patients. This study provides new opportunities for studying the molecular and cellular mechanisms of cardiac arrhythmias in humans, and provides a robust assay for developing new drugs to treat these diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2002404684,"Genome-wide association studies have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 9p21 gene desert associated with coronary artery disease (CAD) and type 2 diabetes. Despite evidence for a role of the associated interval in neighbouring gene regulation, the biological underpinnings of these genetic associations with CAD or type 2 diabetes have not yet been explained. Here we identify 33 enhancers in 9p21; the interval is the second densest gene desert for predicted enhancers and six times denser than the whole genome (P < 6.55 × 10(-33)). The CAD risk alleles of SNPs rs10811656 and rs10757278 are located in one of these enhancers and disrupt a binding site for STAT1. Lymphoblastoid cell lines homozygous for the CAD risk haplotype show no binding of STAT1, and in lymphoblastoid cell lines homozygous for the CAD non-risk haplotype, binding of STAT1 inhibits CDKN2BAS (also known as CDKN2B-AS1) expression, which is reversed by short interfering RNA knockdown of STAT1. Using a new, open-ended approach to detect long-distance interactions, we find that in human vascular endothelial cells the enhancer interval containing the CAD locus physically interacts with the CDKN2A/B locus, the MTAP gene and an interval downstream of IFNA21. In human vascular endothelial cells, interferon-γ activation strongly affects the structure of the chromatin and the transcriptional regulation in the 9p21 locus, including STAT1-binding, long-range enhancer interactions and altered expression of neighbouring genes. Our findings establish a link between CAD genetic susceptibility and the response to inflammatory signalling in a vascular cell type and thus demonstrate the utility of genome-wide association study findings in directing studies to novel genomic loci and biological processes important for disease aetiology."

https://openalex.org/W2016053029,"The acoel flatworms are among the simplest animal forms, so simple that they have neither a through-gut nor a body cavity. But new molecular research has pulled them from their basal position in animal evolution, uniting them with creatures such as echinoderms (starfish, sea urchins and the like) and placing them much closer to the chordates, the group that includes humans. This follows previous revelations that Xenoturbella, a simple flatworm with mysterious evolutionary connections, also belonged to this group. The research implies that acoels are not primitively simple, as had been thought, but have become simpler with time, losing features such as a body cavity, anus and gill slits. New molecular research has pulled acoel flatworms from their basal position in animal evolution, uniting them with creatures such as echinoderms (starfish, sea urchins and allies) — indeed, very much closer to the chordates, the group that includes ourselves. The work follows previous revelations that Xenoturbella, a simple flatworm of mysterious evolutionary connections, also belonged to this group. The research implies that acoels are not primitively simple, as had been thought, but have lost features such as a body cavity, anus and gill slits. Xenoturbellida and Acoelomorpha are marine worms with contentious ancestry. Both were originally associated with the flatworms (Platyhelminthes), but molecular data have revised their phylogenetic positions, generally linking Xenoturbellida to the deuterostomes1,2 and positioning the Acoelomorpha as the most basally branching bilaterian group(s)3,4,5,6. Recent phylogenomic data suggested that Xenoturbellida and Acoelomorpha are sister taxa and together constitute an early branch of Bilateria7. Here we assemble three independent data sets—mitochondrial genes, a phylogenomic data set of 38,330 amino-acid positions and new microRNA (miRNA) complements—and show that the position of Acoelomorpha is strongly affected by a long-branch attraction (LBA) artefact. When we minimize LBA we find consistent support for a position of both acoelomorphs and Xenoturbella within the deuterostomes. The most likely phylogeny links Xenoturbella and Acoelomorpha in a clade we call Xenacoelomorpha. The Xenacoelomorpha is the sister group of the Ambulacraria (hemichordates and echinoderms). We show that analyses of miRNA complements8 have been affected by character loss in the acoels and that both groups possess one miRNA and the gene Rsb66 otherwise specific to deuterostomes. In addition, Xenoturbella shares one miRNA with the ambulacrarians, and two with the acoels. This phylogeny makes sense of the shared characteristics of Xenoturbellida and Acoelomorpha, such as ciliary ultrastructure and diffuse nervous system, and implies the loss of various deuterostome characters in the Xenacoelomorpha including coelomic cavities, through gut and gill slits."
https://openalex.org/W1968138311,"Under physiological conditions the gut-associated lymphoid tissues not only prevent the induction of a local inflammatory immune response, but also induce systemic tolerance to fed antigens. A notable exception is coeliac disease, where genetically susceptible individuals expressing human leukocyte antigen (HLA) HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 molecules develop inflammatory T-cell and antibody responses against dietary gluten, a protein present in wheat. The mechanisms underlying this dysregulated mucosal immune response to a soluble antigen have not been identified. Retinoic acid, a metabolite of vitamin A, has been shown to have a critical role in the induction of intestinal regulatory responses. Here we find in mice that in conjunction with IL-15, a cytokine greatly upregulated in the gut of coeliac disease patients, retinoic acid rapidly activates dendritic cells to induce JNK (also known as MAPK8) phosphorylation and release the proinflammatory cytokines IL-12p70 and IL-23. As a result, in a stressed intestinal environment, retinoic acid acted as an adjuvant that promoted rather than prevented inflammatory cellular and humoral responses to fed antigen. Altogether, these findings reveal an unexpected role for retinoic acid and IL-15 in the abrogation of tolerance to dietary antigens."

https://openalex.org/W1988801159,"Background Argonaute (AGO) proteins bind to small-interfering (si)RNAs and micro (mi)RNAs to target RNA silencing against viruses, transgenes and in regulation of mRNAs. Plants encode multiple AGO proteins but, in Arabidopsis, only AGO1 is known to have an antiviral role. Methodology/Principal Findings To uncover the roles of specific AGOs in limiting virus accumulation we inoculated turnip crinkle virus (TCV) to Arabidopsis plants that were mutant for each of the ten AGO genes. The viral symptoms on most of the plants were the same as on wild type plants although the ago2 mutants were markedly hyper-susceptible to this virus. ago2 plants were also hyper-susceptible to cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), confirming that the antiviral role of AGO2 is not specific to a single virus. For both viruses, this phenotype was associated with transient increase in virus accumulation. In wild type plants the AGO2 protein was induced by TCV and CMV infection. Conclusions/Significance Based on these results we propose that there are multiple layers to RNA-mediated defense and counter-defense in the interactions between plants and their viruses. AGO1 represents a first layer. With some viruses, including TCV and CMV, this layer is overcome by viral suppressors of silencing that can target AGO1 and a second layer involving AGO2 limits virus accumulation. The second layer is activated when the first layer is suppressed because AGO2 is repressed by AGO1 via miR403. The activation of the second layer is therefore a direct consequence of the loss of the first layer of defense."
https://openalex.org/W2056891826,"Previous work on nucleophilic additions catalysed by chiral Brønsted acids has been restricted to polarized heteroatom-containing functionalities such as imines, aziridines and carbonyls. This limitation has yet to be overcome despite the fact that acid-catalysed 'Markovnikov' additions to olefins have been known for more than a century. Here the authors show that chiral dithiophosphoric acids can catalyse the intramolecular hydroamination and hydroarylation of dienes and allenes to generate heterocyclic products in exceptional yield and enantiomeric excess. They present a mechanistic hypothesis that involves the addition of the acid catalyst to the diene, followed by SN2′ displacement of the resulting dithiophosphate intermediate. The proposed mechanism is supported by mass spectroscopy and deuterium labelling studies. Here it is shown that chiral dithiophosphoric acids can catalyse the intramolecular hydroamination and hydroarylation of dienes and allenes to generate heterocyclic products in exceptional yield and enantiomeric excess. A mechanistic hypothesis is presented that involves the addition of the acid catalyst to the diene, followed by SN2′ displacement of the resulting dithiophosphate intermediate, and mass spectroscopic and deuterium labelling studies support the proposed mechanism. Chiral Brønsted acids (proton donors) have been shown to facilitate a broad range of asymmetric chemical transformations under catalytic conditions without requiring additional toxic or expensive metals1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Although the catalysts developed thus far are remarkably effective at activating polarized functional groups, it is not clear whether organic Brønsted acids can be used to catalyse highly enantioselective transformations of unactivated carbon–carbon multiple bonds. This deficiency persists despite the fact that racemic acid-catalysed ‘Markovnikov’ additions to alkenes are well known chemical transformations. Here we show that chiral dithiophosphoric acids can catalyse the intramolecular hydroamination and hydroarylation of dienes and allenes to generate heterocyclic products in exceptional yield and enantiomeric excess. We present a mechanistic hypothesis that involves the addition of the acid catalyst to the diene, followed by nucleophilic displacement of the resulting dithiophosphate intermediate; we also report mass spectroscopic and deuterium labelling studies in support of the proposed mechanism. The catalysts and concepts revealed in this study should prove applicable to other asymmetric functionalizations of unsaturated systems."
https://openalex.org/W1965342510,"An increasing body of evidence indicates that accumulation of soluble oligomeric assemblies of β-amyloid polypeptide (Aβ) play a key role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Specifically, 56 kDa oligomeric species were shown to be correlated with impaired cognitive function in AD model mice. Several reports have documented the inhibition of Aβ plaque formation by compounds from natural sources. Yet, evidence for the ability of common edible elements to modulate Aβ oligomerization remains an unmet challenge. Here we identify a natural substance, based on cinnamon extract (CEppt), which markedly inhibits the formation of toxic Aβ oligomers and prevents the toxicity of Aβ on neuronal PC12 cells. When administered to an AD fly model, CEppt rectified their reduced longevity, fully recovered their locomotion defects and totally abolished tetrameric species of Aβ in their brain. Furthermore, oral administration of CEppt to an aggressive AD transgenic mice model led to marked decrease in 56 kDa Aβ oligomers, reduction of plaques and improvement in cognitive behavior. Our results present a novel prophylactic approach for inhibition of toxic oligomeric Aβ species formation in AD through the utilization of a compound that is currently in use in human diet."

https://openalex.org/W2055515566,"miRNAs are now recognized as key regulator elements in gene expression. Although they have been associated with a number of human diseases, their implication in acute and chronic asthma and their association with lung remodelling have never been thoroughly investigated.In order to establish a miRNAs expression profile in lung tissue, mice were sensitized and challenged with ovalbumin mimicking acute, intermediate and chronic human asthma. Levels of lung miRNAs were profiled by microarray and in silico analyses were performed to identify potential mRNA targets and to point out signalling pathways and biological processes regulated by miRNA-dependent mechanisms. Fifty-eight, 66 and 75 miRNAs were found to be significantly modulated at short-, intermediate- and long-term challenge, respectively. Inverse correlation with the expression of potential mRNA targets identified mmu-miR-146b, -223, -29b, -29c, -483, -574-5p, -672 and -690 as the best candidates for an active implication in asthma pathogenesis. A functional validation assay was performed by cotransfecting in human lung fibroblasts (WI26) synthetic miRNAs and engineered expression constructs containing the coding sequence of luciferase upstream of the 3'UTR of various potential mRNA targets. The bioinformatics analysis identified miRNA-linked regulation of several signalling pathways, as matrix metalloproteinases, inflammatory response and TGF-β signalling, and biological processes, including apoptosis and inflammation.This study highlights that specific miRNAs are likely to be involved in asthma disease and could represent a valuable resource both for biological makers identification and for unveiling mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of asthma."
https://openalex.org/W2026264690,"Orexins are neuro-modulatory peptides involved in the control of diverse physiological functions through interaction with two receptors, orexin-1 (OX1R) and orexin-2 (OX2R). Recent evidence in pre-clinical models points toward a putative dichotomic role of the two receptors, with OX2R predominantly involved in the regulation of the sleep/wake cycle and arousal, and the OX1R being more specifically involved in reward processing and motivated behaviour. However, the specific neural substrates underlying these distinct processes in the rat brain remain to be elucidated. Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in the rat to map the modulatory effect of selective OXR blockade on the functional response produced by D-amphetamine, a psychostimulant and arousing drug that stimulates orexigenic activity. OXR blockade was produced by GSK1059865 and JNJ1037049, two novel OX1R and OX2R antagonists with unprecedented selectivity at the counter receptor type. Both drugs inhibited the functional response to D-amphetamine albeit with distinct neuroanatomical patterns: GSK1059865 focally modulated functional responses in striatal terminals, whereas JNJ1037049 induced a widespread pattern of attenuation characterised by a prominent cortical involvement. At the same doses tested in the fMRI study, JNJ1037049 exhibited robust hypnotic properties, while GSK1059865 failed to display significant sleep-promoting effects, but significantly reduced drug-seeking behaviour in cocaine-induced conditioned place preference. Collectively, these findings highlight an essential contribution of the OX2R in modulating cortical activity and arousal, an effect that is consistent with the robust hypnotic effect exhibited by JNJ1037049. The subcortical and striatal pattern observed with GSK1059865 represent a possible neurofunctional correlate for the modulatory role of OX1R in controlling reward-processing and goal-oriented behaviours in the rat."
https://openalex.org/W2027589602,"Massively parallel DNA sequencing is capable of sequencing tens of millions of DNA fragments at the same time. However, sequence bias in the initial cycles, which are used to determine the coordinates of individual clusters, causes a loss of fidelity in cluster identification on Illumina Genome Analysers. This can result in a significant reduction in the numbers of clusters that can be analysed. Such low sample diversity is an intrinsic problem of sequencing libraries that are generated by restriction enzyme digestion, such as e4C-seq or reduced-representation libraries. Similarly, this problem can also arise through the combined sequencing of barcoded, multiplexed libraries. We describe a procedure to defer the mapping of cluster coordinates until low-diversity sequences have been passed. This simple procedure can recover substantial amounts of next generation sequencing data that would otherwise be lost."
https://openalex.org/W2158718496,"In humans, the antimicrobial peptide LL-37 and leukotriene B4 (LTB4) are important proinflammatory mediators, whereas lipoxin A4 (LXA4) and resolvin E1 (RvE1) possess anti-inflammatory, prore-solving properties. Previously, we reported that LTB4 triggers LL-37 release from human neutrophils (PMNs) and, conversely, that LL-37 promotes LTB4 production from these cells. Here we show that this effect of LL-37 is mediated via the GPCR FPR2/ALX. LL-37 (5–30 µg/ml) induces intracellular calcium mobilization in a dose-dependent manner, and the signal transduction leading to LTB4 release involves p38 MAP kinase and phosphorylation of cPLA2. LXA4, an endogenous lipid ligand of FPR2/ALX, and a stable LXA4 analog [benzo-LXA4] were ineffective as stimuli at the concentrations of 0.1–10 nM for LTB4 release from PMNs. Likewise, the BLT1 ligand RvE1, a derivative of eicosapentaenoic acid, inhibited LTB4-induced LL-37 production from PMNs at 1–100 nM, whereas chemerin, a peptide ligand of the RvE1 receptor ChemR23, failed to block LTB4-induced LL-37 release at the same concentrations. Hence, in human neutrophils, binding of LL-37 to FPR2/ALX promotes LTB4 production, which can bind to BLT1 and elicit further LL-37 release. This proin-flammatory circuit might be inhibited by LXA4 and RvE1 acting at FPR2/ALX and BLT1, respectively, leading to dampened mediator release.—Wan, M., Godson, C., Guiry, P. J., Agerberth, B., Haeggström, J. Z. Leukotriene B4/antimicrobial peptide LL-37 proinflammatory circuits are mediated by BLT1 and FPR2/ALX and are counterregulated by lipoxin A4 and resolvin E1.

https://openalex.org/W2025005589,"Guanylyl Cyclase C (GCC) signaling via uroguanylin (UGN) and guanylin activation is a critical mediator of intestinal fluid homeostasis, intestinal cell proliferation/apoptosis, and tumorigenesis. As a mechanism for some of these effects, we hypothesized that GCC signaling mediates regulation of intestinal barrier function.Paracellular permeability of intestinal segments was assessed in wild type (WT) and GCC deficient (GCC-/-) mice with and without lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge, as well as in UGN deficient (UGN-/-) mice. IFNγ and myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) levels were determined by real time PCR. Expression of tight junction proteins (TJPs), phosphorylation of myosin II regulatory light chain (MLC), and STAT1 activation were examined in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and intestinal mucosa. The permeability of Caco-2 and HT-29 IEC monolayers, grown on Transwell filters was determined in the absence and presence of GCC RNA interference (RNAi). We found that intestinal permeability was increased in GCC-/- and UGN-/- mice compared to WT, accompanied by increased IFNγ levels, MLCK and STAT1 activation in IECs. LPS challenge promotes greater IFNγ and STAT1 activation in IECs of GCC-/- mice compared to WT mice. Claudin-2 and JAM-A expression were reduced in GCC deficient intestine; the level of phosphorylated MLC in IECs was significantly increased in GCC-/- and UGN-/- mice compared to WT. GCC knockdown induced MLC phosphorylation, increased permeability in IEC monolayers under basal conditions, and enhanced TNFα and IFNγ-induced monolayer hyperpermeability.GCC signaling plays a protective role in the integrity of the intestinal mucosal barrier by regulating MLCK activation and TJ disassembly. GCC signaling activation may therefore represent a novel mechanism in maintaining the small bowel barrier in response to injury."
https://openalex.org/W1970419675,"In geometrically frustrated materials, an intrinsic incompatibility between fundamental interaction rules and the underlying lattice geometry leads to exotic material behaviour. The phenomenon is well known in magnetic materials but had not been reported in ferroelectrics, a technologically important class of materials. Choudhury et al. present computational results that show that it is possible to induce geometric frustration in ferroelectrics — they use barium–strontium titanate — with compositional grading. Their simulations predict the formation of exotic ordered phases. These new structures shed light on the microscopic origin of frustration in such systems, and may provide a versatile experimental system for the study of frustration. In geometrically frustrated materials there is an intrinsic incompatibility between fundamental interaction rules and the underlying lattice geometry, which leads to exotic material behaviour. So far, geometric frustration has been reported for a range of magnetic materials but not yet in ferroelectrics, which would be of significant fundamental interest. This study reports computational results that show that geometric frustration can be induced in ferroelectrics with compositional grading. The findings reveal unusual ordered phases, allowing new microscopic insights in the phenomenon of geometric frustration. Geometric frustration is a broad phenomenon that results from an intrinsic incompatibility between some fundamental interactions and the underlying lattice geometry1,2,3,4,5,6,7. Geometric frustration gives rise to new fundamental phenomena and is known to yield intriguing effects such as the formation of exotic states like spin ice, spin liquids and spin glasses1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17. It has also led to interesting findings of fractional charge quantization and magnetic monopoles5,6. Mechanisms related to geometric frustration have been proposed to understand the origins of relaxor and multiferroic behaviour, colossal magnetocapacitive coupling, and unusual and novel mechanisms of high-transition-temperature superconductivity3,4,5,12,16. Although geometric frustration has been particularly well studied in magnetic systems in the past 20 years or so, its manifestation in the important class formed by ferroelectric materials (which are compounds with electric rather than magnetic dipoles) is basically unknown. Here we show, using a technique based on first principles, that compositionally graded ferroelectrics possess the characteristic ‘fingerprints’ associated with geometric frustration. These systems have a highly degenerate energy surface and display critical phenomena. They further reveal exotic orderings with novel stripe phases involving complex spatial organization. These stripes display spiral states, topological defects and curvature. Compositionally graded ferroelectrics can thus be considered the ‘missing link’ that brings ferroelectrics into the broad category of materials able to exhibit geometric frustration. Our ab initio calculations allow deep microscopic insight into this novel geometrically frustrated system."
https://openalex.org/W1975469223,"Background Graves' disease (GD) is the leading cause of hyperthyroidism and thyroid eye disease inherited as a complex trait. Although geoepidemiology studies showed relatively higher prevalence of GD in Asians than in Caucasians, previous genetic studies were contradictory concerning whether and/or which human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles are associated with GD in Asians. Methodology/Principal Findings We conducted a case-control association study (499 unrelated GD cases and 504 controls) and a replication in an independent family sample (419 GD individuals and their 282 relatives in 165 families). To minimize genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity, we included only ethnic Chinese Han population in Taiwan and excluded subjects with hypothyroidism. We performed direct and comprehensive genotyping of six classical HLA loci (HLA-A, -B, -C, -DPB1, -DQB1 and -DRB1) to 4-digit resolution. Combining the data of two sample populations, we found that B*46:01 (odds ratio under dominant model [OR] = 1.33, Bonferroni corrected combined P [PBc] = 1.17×10−2), DPB1*05:01 (OR = 2.34, PBc = 2.58×10−10), DQB1*03:02 (OR = 0.62, PBc = 1.97×10−2), DRB1*15:01 (OR = 1.68, PBc = 1.22×10−2) and DRB1*16:02 (OR = 2.63, PBc = 1.46×10−5) were associated with GD. HLA-DPB1*05:01 is the major gene of GD in our population and singly accounts for 48.4% of population-attributable risk. Conclusions/Significance These GD-associated alleles we identified in ethnic Chinese Hans, and those identified in other Asian studies, are totally distinct from the known associated alleles in Caucasians. Identification of population-specific association alleles is the critical first step for individualized medicine. Furthermore, comparison between different susceptibility/protective alleles across populations could facilitate generation of novel hypothesis about GD pathophysiology and indicate a new direction for future investigation."

Molecular dating places the divergence time of the lineages leading to beavers and Anomalurus as early as around 54 million years ago (mya). The living beaver species, Castor canadensis from North America and Castor fiber from Eurasia, although similar in appearance, appear to have diverged from a common ancestor more than seven mya. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that a migration of Castor from Eurasia to North America as early as 7.5 mya could have initiated their speciation. We date the common ancestor of the extant Eurasian beaver relict populations to around 210,000 years ago, much earlier than previously thought. Finally, the substitution rate of Castor mitochondrial DNA is considerably lower than that of other rodents. We found evidence that this is correlated with the longer life span of beavers compared to other rodents.A phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial genome sequences suggests a sister-group relationship between Castor and Anomalurus, and allows molecular dating of species divergence in congruence with paleontological data. The implementation of a relaxed molecular clock enabled us to estimate mitochondrial substitution rates and to evaluate the effect of life history traits on it."
https://openalex.org/W1966276188,"Previous studies of E2F family members have suggested that protein-protein interactions may be the mechanism by which E2F proteins are recruited to specific genomic regions. We have addressed this hypothesis on a genome-wide scale using ChIP-seq analysis of MCF7 cell lines that express tagged wild type and mutant E2F1 proteins. First, we performed ChIP-seq for tagged WT E2F1. Then, we analyzed E2F1 proteins that lacked the N-terminal SP1 and cyclin A binding domains, the C-terminal transactivation and pocket protein binding domains, and the internal marked box domain. Surprisingly, we found that the ChIP-seq patterns of the mutant proteins were identical to that of WT E2F1. However, mutation of the DNA binding domain abrogated all E2F1 binding to the genome. These results suggested that the interaction between the E2F1 DNA binding domain and a consensus motif may be the primary determinant of E2F1 recruitment. To address this possibility, we analyzed the in vivo binding sites for the in vitro-derived consensus E2F1 motif (TTTSSCGC) and also performed de novo motif analysis. We found that only 12% of the ChIP-seq peaks contained the TTTSSCGC motif. De novo motif analysis indicated that most of the in vivo sites lacked the 5' half of the in vitro-derived consensus, having instead the in vivo consensus of CGCGC. In summary, our findings do not provide support for the model that protein-protein interactions are involved in recruiting E2F1 to the genome, but rather suggest that recognition of a motif found at most human promoters is the critical determinant."
https://openalex.org/W2028853048,"Polyphosphate is a ubiquitous linear homopolymer of phosphate residues linked by high-energy bonds similar to those found in ATP. It has been associated with many processes including pathogenicity, DNA uptake and multiple stress responses across all domains. Bacteria have also been shown to use polyphosphate as a way to store phosphate when transferred from phosphate-limited to phosphate-rich media – a process exploited in wastewater treatment and other environmental contaminant remediation. Despite this, there has, to date, been little research into the role of polyphosphate in the survival of marine bacterioplankton in oligotrophic environments. The three main proteins involved in polyphosphate metabolism, Ppk1, Ppk2 and Ppx are multi-domain and have differential inter-domain and inter-gene conservation, making unbiased analysis of relative abundance in metagenomic datasets difficult. This paper describes the development of a novel Isofunctional Homolog Annotation Tool (IHAT) to detect homologs of genes with a broad range of conservation without bias of traditional expect-value cutoffs. IHAT analysis of the Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) dataset revealed that genes associated with polyphosphate metabolism are more abundant in environments where available phosphate is limited, suggesting an important role for polyphosphate metabolism in marine oligotrophs."
https://openalex.org/W1994540190,"Tumor microenvironments present significant barriers to penetration by antibodies and immunoconjugates. Tumor microenvironments, however, are difficult to study in vitro. Cells cultured as monolayers exhibit less resistance to therapy than those grown in vivo and an alternative research model more representative of the in vivo tumor is more desirable. SS1P is an immunotoxin composed of the Fv portion of a mesothelin-specific antibody fused to a bacterial toxin that is presently undergoing clinical trials in mesothelioma.Here, we examined how the tumor microenvironment affects the penetration and killing activity of SS1P in a new three-dimensional (3D) spheroid model cultured in vitro using the human mesothelioma cell line (NCI-H226) and two primary cell lines isolated from the ascites of malignant mesothelioma patients. Mesothelioma cells grown as monolayers or as spheroids expressed comparable levels of mesothelin; however, spheroids were at least 100 times less affected by SS1P. To understand this disparity in cytotoxicity, we made fluorescence-labeled SS1P molecules and used confocal microscopy to examine the time course of SS1P penetration within spheroids. The penetration was limited after 4 hours. Interestingly, we found a significant increase in the number of tight junctions in the core area of spheroids by electron microscopy. Expression of E-Cadherin, a protein involved in the assembly and sealing of tight junctions and highly expressed in malignant mesothelioma, was found significantly increased in spheroids as compared to monolayers. Moreover, we found that siRNA silencing and antibody inhibition targeting E-Cadherin could enhance SS1P immunotoxin therapy in vitro.This work is one of the first to investigate immunotoxins in 3D tumor spheroids in vitro. This initial description of an in vitro tumor model may offer a simple and more representative model of in vivo tumors and will allow for further investigations of the microenvironmental effects on drug penetration and tumor cell killing. We believe that the methods developed here may apply to the studies of other tumor-targeting antibodies and immunoconjugates in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W2001410779,"N-terminal proteolysis of huntingtin is thought to be an important mediator of HD pathogenesis. The formation of short N-terminal fragments of huntingtin (cp-1/cp-2, cp-A/cp-B) has been demonstrated in cells and in vivo. We previously mapped the cp-2 cleavage site by mass spectrometry to position Arg167 of huntingtin. The proteolytic enzymes generating short N-terminal fragments of huntingtin remain unknown. To search for such proteases, we conducted a genome-wide screen using an RNA-silencing approach and an assay for huntingtin proteolysis based on the detection of cp-1 and cp-2 fragments by Western blotting. The primary screen was carried out in HEK293 cells, and the secondary screen was carried out in neuronal HT22 cells, transfected in both cases with a construct encoding the N-terminal 511 amino acids of mutant huntingtin. For additional validation of the hits, we employed a complementary assay for proteolysis of huntingtin involving overexpression of individual proteases with huntingtin in two cell lines. The screen identified 11 enzymes, with two major candidates to carry out the cp-2 cleavage, bleomycin hydrolase (BLMH) and cathepsin Z, which are both cysteine proteases of a papain-like structure. Knockdown of either protease reduced cp-2 cleavage, and ameliorated mutant huntingtin induced toxicity, whereas their overexpression increased the cp-2 cleavage. Both proteases partially co-localized with Htt in the cytoplasm and within or in association with early and late endosomes, with some nuclear co-localization observed for cathepsin Z. BLMH and cathepsin Z are expressed in the brain and have been associated previously with neurodegeneration. Our findings further validate the cysteine protease family, and BLMH and cathepsin Z in particular, as potential novel targets for HD therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2081098793,"A-T (ataxia telangiectasia) is a genetic disease caused by a mutation in the Atm (A-T mutated) gene that leads to neurodegeneration. Despite an increase in the numbers of studies in this area in recent years, the mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration in human A-T are still poorly understood. Previous studies demonstrated that neural stem cells (NSCs) isolated from the subventricular zone (SVZ) of Atm-/- mouse brains show defective self-renewal and proliferation, which is accompanied by activation of chronic p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and a lower level of the polycomb protein Bmi-1. However, the mechanism underlying Bmi-1 down-regulation and its relevance to defective proliferation in Atm-/- NSCs remained unclear. Here, we show that over-expression of Bmi-1 increases self-renewal and proliferation of Atm-/- NSCs to normal, indicating that defective proliferation in Atm-/- NSCs is a consequence of down-regulation of Bmi-1. We also demonstrate that epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced Akt phosphorylation renders Bmi-1 resistant to the proteasomal degradation, leading to its stabilization and accumulation in the nucleus. However, inhibition of the Akt-dependent Bmi-1 stabilizing process by p38 MAPK signaling reduces the levels of Bmi-1. Treatment of the Atm-/- NSCs with a specific p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 extended Bmi-1 posttranscriptional turnover and H2A ubiquitination in Atm-/- NSCs. Our observations demonstrate the molecular basis underlying the impairment of self-renewal and proliferation in Atm-/- NSCs through the p38 MAPK-Akt-Bmi-1-p21 signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1983739061,"The distribution of lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] levels can differ dramatically across diverse racial/ethnic populations. The extent to which genetic variation in LPA can explain these differences is not fully understood. To explore this, 19 LPA tagSNPs were genotyped in 7,159 participants from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III). NHANES III is a diverse population-based survey with DNA samples linked to hundreds of quantitative traits, including serum Lp(a). Tests of association between LPA variants and transformed Lp(a) levels were performed across the three different NHANES subpopulations (non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, and Mexican Americans). At a significance threshold of p<0.0001, 15 of the 19 SNPs tested were strongly associated with Lp(a) levels in at least one subpopulation, six in at least two subpopulations, and none in all three subpopulations. In non-Hispanic whites, three variants were associated with Lp(a) levels, including previously known rs6919246 (p = 1.18 × 10(-30)). Additionally, 12 and 6 variants had significant associations in non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican Americans, respectively. The additive effects of these associated alleles explained up to 11% of the variance observed for Lp(a) levels in the different racial/ethnic populations. The findings reported here replicate previous candidate gene and genome-wide association studies for Lp(a) levels in European-descent populations and extend these findings to other populations. While we demonstrate that LPA is an important contributor to Lp(a) levels regardless of race/ethnicity, the lack of generalization of associations across all subpopulations suggests that specific LPA variants may be contributing to the observed Lp(a) between-population variance."
https://openalex.org/W1963871324,"Protein phosphatase M (PPM) regulates key signaling pathways in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Novel structures of bacterial PPM members revealed three divalent metal ions in their catalytic centers. The function of metal 3 (M3) remained unclear. To reveal its function, we created variants of tPphA from Thermosynechococcus elongatus in all metal-coordinating residues, and multiple variants were created for the M3 coordinating Asp-119 residue. The structures of variants D119A and D193A were resolved, showing loss of M3 binding but unaffected binding of M1 and M2 in the catalytic center of D119A, with the nucleophilic water molecule in the correct place. The catalytic activity of this variant was highly impaired. This and further structure-function analyses showed that M3 is required for catalysis by providing a water molecule as a proton donor during catalysis. Mutation of the homologue Asp residue in human PP2Cα also caused loss of function, suggesting a general requirement of M3 in PPM-catalyzed reactions."
https://openalex.org/W1982713585,"The transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) channel is a thermosensory receptor implicated in diverse physiological and pathological processes. The TRP domain, a highly conserved region in the C terminus adjacent to the internal channel gate, is critical for subunit tetramerization and channel gating. Here, we show that cell-penetrating, membrane-anchored peptides patterned after this protein domain are moderate and selective TRPV1 antagonists both in vitro and in vivo, blocking receptor activity in intact rat primary sensory neurons and their peripheral axons with mean decline time of 30 min. The most potent lipopeptide, TRP-p5, blocked all modes of TRPV1 gating with micromolar efficacy (IC(50)<10 μM), without significantly affecting other thermoTRP channels. In contrast, its retrosequence or the corresponding sequences of other TRPV channels did not alter TRPV1 channel activity (IC(50)>100 μM). TRP-p5 did not affect the capsaicin sensitivity of the vanilloid receptor. Our data suggest that TRP-p5 interferes with protein-protein interactions at the level of the TRP domain that are essential for the ""conformational"" change that leads to gate opening. Therefore, these palmitoylated peptides, which we termed TRPducins, are noncompetitive, voltage-independent, sequence-specific TRPV1 blockers. Our findings indicate that TRPducin-like peptides may embody a novel molecular strategy that can be exploited to generate a selective pharmacological arsenal for the TRP superfamily of ion channels."
https://openalex.org/W2091400998,"The mitotic checkpoint functions to ensure accurate chromosome segregation by regulating the progression from metaphase to anaphase. Once the checkpoint has been satisfied, it is inactivated in order to allow the cell to proceed into anaphase and complete the cell cycle. The minus end-directed microtubule motor dynein/dynactin has been implicated in the silencing of the mitotic checkpoint by “stripping” checkpoint proteins off kinetochores. A recent study suggested that Nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) stimulates dynein/dynactin-mediated transport of its cargo including ZW10 (Zeste White 10). We analyzed the effects of NDGA on dynein/dynactin dependent transport of the RZZ (Zeste White 10, Roughdeal, Zwilch) complex as well as other kinetochore components from kinetochores to spindle poles. Through this approach we have catalogued several kinetochore and centromere components as dynein/dynactin cargo. These include hZW10, hZwilch, hROD, hSpindly, hMad1, hMad2, hCENP-E, hCdc27, cyclin-B and hMps1. Furthermore, we found that treatment with NDGA induced a robust accumulation and complete stabilization of hZW10 at spindle poles. This finding suggests that NDGA may not induce dynein/dynactin transport but rather interfere with cargo release. Lastly, we determined that NDGA induced accumulation of checkpoint proteins at the poles requires dynein/dynactin-mediated transport, hZW10 kinetochore localization and kinetochore-microtubule attachments but not tension or Aurora B kinase activity."
https://openalex.org/W2031271690,"Transgenic mice expressing eGFP under population specific promoters are widely used in neuroscience to identify specific subsets of neurons in situ and as sensors of neuronal activity in vivo. Mice expressing eGFP from a bacterial artificial chromosome under the Nr4a1 promoter have high expression within the basal ganglia, particularly within the striosome compartments and striatal-like regions of the extended amygdala (bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, striatal fundus, central amygdaloid nucleus and intercalated cells). Grossly, eGFP expression is inverse to the matrix marker calbindin 28K and overlaps with mu-opioid receptor immunoreactivity in the striatum. This pattern of expression is similar to Drd1, but not Drd2, dopamine receptor driven eGFP expression in structures targeted by medium spiny neuron afferents. Striosomal expression is strong developmentally where Nr4a1-eGFP expression overlaps with Drd1, TrkB, tyrosine hydroxylase and phospho-ERK, but not phospho-CREB, immunoreactivity in ""dopamine islands"". Exposure of adolescent mice to methylphenidate resulted in an increase in eGFP in both compartments in the dorsolateral striatum but eGFP expression remained brighter in the striosomes. To address the role of activity in Nr4a1-eGFP expression, primary striatal cultures were prepared from neonatal mice and treated with forskolin, BDNF, SKF-83822 or high extracellular potassium and eGFP was measured fluorometrically in lysates. eGFP was induced in both neurons and contaminating glia in response to forskolin but SKF-83822, brain derived neurotrophic factor and depolarization increased eGFP in neuronal-like cells selectively. High levels of eGFP were primarily associated with Drd1+ neurons in vitro detected by immunofluorescence; however ∼15% of the brightly expressing cells contained punctate met-enkephalin immunoreactivity. The Nr4a1-GFP mouse strain will be a useful model for examining the connectivity, physiology, activity and development of the striosome system."
https://openalex.org/W1966903866,"Embryonic development is guided by a complex and integrated set of stimuli that results in collective system-wide organization that is both time and space regulated. These regulatory interactions result in the emergence of highly functional units, which are correlated to frequency-modulated stimulation profiles. We have determined the dynamic response of vertebrate embryonic tissues to highly controlled, time-varying localized chemical stimulation using a microfluidic system with feedback control. Our approach has enabled localized spatiotemporal manipulation of the steroid hormone dexamethasone (DEX) in Animal Cap (AC) tissues isolated from gastrulating Xenopus embryos. Using this approach we investigated cell-scale responses to precisely controlled stimulation by tracking the redistribution of a GFP-tagged DEX-reporter constructed from the human glucocorticoid receptor (GR). We exposed defined regions of a single AC explant to different stimulation conditions--continuous stimulation, periodic stimulation, and no stimulation. We observed collective behavior of the GR transport into the nucleus was first-order. Furthermore, the dynamic response was well-modeled by a first-order differential equation with a single time derivative. The model predicted that responses to periodic stimulations closely matched the results of the frequency-based experiments. We find that stimulation with localized bursts versus continuous stimulation can result in highly distinct responses. This finding is critical as controlled space and time exposure to growth factors is a hallmark of complex processes in embryonic development. These complex responses to cellular signaling and transport machinery were similar to emergent behaviors in other complex systems, suggesting that even within a complex embryonic tissue, the overall system can converge toward a predictive first-order response."
https://openalex.org/W2158129079,"We present a cell based system and experimental approach to characterize agonist and antagonist selectivity for ligand-gated ion channels (LGIC) by developing sensor cells stably expressing a Ca2+ permeable LGIC and a genetically encoded Förster (or fluorescence) resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based calcium sensor. In particular, we describe separate lines with human α7 and human α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, mouse 5-HT3A serotonin receptors and a chimera of human α7/mouse 5-HT3A receptors. Complete concentration-response curves for agonists and Schild plots of antagonists were generated from these sensors and the results validate known pharmacology of the receptors tested. Concentration-response relations can be generated from either the initial rate or maximal amplitudes of FRET-signal. Although assaying at a medium throughput level, this pharmacological fluorescence detection technique employs a clonal line for stability and has versatility for screening laboratory generated congeners as agonists or antagonists on multiple subtypes of ligand-gated ion channels. The clonal sensor lines are also compatible with in vivo usage to measure indirectly receptor activation by endogenous neurotransmitters."
https://openalex.org/W2011100601,"We have used microarray-based methods of global gene expression together with quantitative PCR and Western blot analysis to identify dysregulation of genes and aberrant cellular processes in human fibroblasts and in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells made HPRT-deficient by transduction with a retrovirus stably expressing an shRNA targeted against HPRT. Analysis of the microarray expression data by Gene ontology (GO) and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) as well as significant pathway analysis by GeneSpring GX10 and Panther Classification System reveal that HPRT deficiency is accompanied by aberrations in a variety of pathways known to regulate neurogenesis or to be implicated in neurodegenerative disease, including the canonical Wnt/β-catenin and the Alzheimer's disease/presenilin signaling pathways. Dysregulation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway is confirmed by Western blot demonstration of cytosolic sequestration of β-catenin during in vitro differentiation of the SH-SY5Y cells toward the neuronal phenotype. We also demonstrate that two key transcription factor genes known to be regulated by Wnt signaling and to be vital for the generation and function of dopaminergic neurons; i.e., Lmx1a and Engrailed 1, are down-regulated in the HPRT knockdown SH-SY5Y cells. In addition to the Wnt signaling aberration, we found that expression of presenilin-1 shows severely aberrant expression in HPRT-deficient SH-SY5Y cells, reflected by marked deficiency of the 23 kDa C-terminal fragment of presenilin-1 in knockdown cells. Western blot analysis of primary fibroblast cultures from two LND patients also shows dysregulated presenilin-1 expression, including aberrant proteolytic processing of presenilin-1. These demonstrations of dysregulated Wnt signaling and presenilin-1 expression together with impaired expression of dopaminergic transcription factors reveal broad pleitropic neuro-regulatory defects played by HPRT expression and suggest new directions for investigating mechanisms of aberrant neurogenesis and neuropathology in LND and potential new targets for restoration of effective signaling in this neuro-developmental defect."
https://openalex.org/W2045731555,"The identity and subcellular sources of endocannabinoids (eCBs) will shape their ability to affect synaptic transmission and, ultimately, behavior. Recent discoveries support the conclusion that 2-arachidonoyl glycerol, 2-AG, is the major signaling eCB, however, some important issues remain open. 2-AG can be synthesized by a mechanism that is strictly Ca2+-dependent, and another that is initiated by G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and facilitated by Ca2+. An important question is whether or not the 2-AG in these cases is synthesized by the same pool of diacylglycerol lipase alpha (DAGLα). Using whole-cell voltage-clamp techniques in CA1 pyramidal cells in acute in vitro rat hippocampal slices, we investigated two mechanistically distinct eCB-mediated responses to address this issue. We now report that pharmacological inhibitors of DGLα have quantitatively different effects on eCB-mediated responses triggered by different stimuli, suggesting that functional, and perhaps physical, distinctions among pools of DAGLα exist."

https://openalex.org/W2013583809,"We investigated the hypothesis that salivary gland inoculation stimulates formation of ectopic germinal centers (GCs), transforming the gland into a mucosal inductive site. Intraglandular infection of mice with murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV; control: UV-inactivated MCMV) induces salivary gland ectopic follicles comprising cognate interactions between CD4(+) and B220(+) lymphocytes, IgM(+) and isotype-switched IgG(+) and IgA(+) B cells, antigen presenting cells, and follicular dendritic cells. B cells coexpressed the GC markers GCT (57%) and GL7 (52%), and bound the lectin peanut agglutinin. Lymphoid follicles were characterized by a 2- to 3-fold increase in mRNA for CXCL13 (lymphoid neogenesis), syndecan-1 (plasma cells), Blimp-1 (plasma cell development/differentiation), and a 2- to 6-fold increase for activation-induced cytidine deaminase, PAX5, and the nonexcised rearranged DNA of an IgA class-switch event, supporting somatic hypermutation and class-switch recombination within the salivary follicles. Intraglandular inoculation also provided protection against a systemic MCMV challenge, as evidenced by decreased viral titers (10(5) plaque-forming units to undetectable), and restoration of normal salivary flow rates from a 6-fold decrease. Therefore, these features suggest that the salivary gland participates in oral mucosal immunity via generation of ectopic GCs, which function as ectopic mucosal inductive sites."
https://openalex.org/W2088812843,"The mechanisms that regulate the incorporation and release of tissue factors (TFs) into cell-derived microparticles are as yet unidentified. In this study, we have explored the regulation of TF release into microparticles by the phosphorylation of serine residues within the cytoplasmic domain of TF. Wild-type and mutant forms of TF, containing alanine and aspartate substitutions at Ser253 and Ser258, were overexpressed in coronary artery and dermal microvascular endothelial cells and microparticle release stimulated with PAR2 agonist peptide (PAR2-AP). The release of TF antigen and activity was then monitored. In addition, the phosphorylation state of the two serine residues within the released microparticles and the cells was monitored for 150 min. The release of wild-type TF as procoagulant microparticles peaked at 90 min and declined thereafter in both cell types. The TF within these microparticles was phosphorylated at Ser253 but not at Ser258. Aspartate substitution of Ser253 resulted in rapid release of TF antigen but not activity, whereas TF release was reduced and delayed by alanine substitution of Ser253 or aspartate substitution of Ser258. Alanine substitution of Ser258 prolonged the release of TF following PAR2-AP activation. The release of TF was concurrent with phosphorylation of Ser253 and was followed by dephosphorylation at 120 min and phosphorylation of Ser258. We propose a sequential mechanism in which the phosphorylation of Ser253 through PAR2 activation results in the incorporation of TF into microparticles, simultaneously inducing Ser258 phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of Ser258 in turn promotes the dephosphorylation of Ser253 and suppresses the release of TF."

The soluble domain is anchored to the membrane through interaction with two hydrophobic membrane-spanning subunits (SdhC/FrdC and SdhD/FrdD). The flavoprotein and iron-sulfur protein subunits are highly conserved throughout eukaryotes and prokaryotes; however, the primary sequence of the membrane-spanning subunit is more varied (1Hägerhäll C.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 18007-18012Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 6Oyedotun K.S. Sit C.S. Lemire B.D. Biochim. Biophys.

In E. coli and related bacteria, different quinones are utilized during aerobic or anaerobic growth of the organism (8Unden G. Bongaerts J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1320: 217-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). EPR and redox studies have shown that a difference between QFR and SQR is that the chain of iron-sulfur clusters is of lower potential in QFR compared with SQR, consistent with the physiological role of the two enzymes in anaerobic and aerobic respiration, respectively (1Hägerhäll C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1320: 107-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 2Cecchini G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 77-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 3Lancaster C.R.D.

Acta. 2002; 1553: 140-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Consequently, for QFR, menaquinone (MQ; Em,7 = −74 mV) is the preferred physiological donor of electrons to the [3Fe-4S]1+,0 cluster, whereas in SQR, ubiquinone (UQ; Em,7 = +90 mV) is the acceptor of electrons from this cluster. Similar to many other electron transfer proteins, a chain of redox cofactors connects the spatially separated catalytic sites where the substrates, dicarboxylates and quinones, are oxidized/reduced. Iron-sulfur clusters comprise one of the most common classes of such redox electron carriers. The midpoint potential (Em) of the redox cofactors is usually defined by the Em values of the redox transitions catalyzed. The redox potential of the [3Fe-4S] cluster in E. coli SQR is Em = +70 mV (5Tran Q.M. Rothery R.A. Maklashina E. Cecchini G. Weiner J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 18007-18012Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), near the potential of its electron acceptor UQ, whereas for QFR it is some 140 mV lower (Em = −70 mV) (9Kowal A.T. Werth M.T.

Ackrell B.A. Kearney E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13631-13638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), nearly isopotential with its electron donor MQ. Thus, it appears that the enzymes have evolved so that the protein environment controls the redox potential of the iron-sulfur cluster involved in accepting/donating electrons from the quinones. A number of factors have been proposed to control the Em of iron-sulfur clusters including (i) the local hydrogen bonding network, (ii) solvent accessibility, (iii) charged residues in the vicinity of the iron-sulfur cluster affecting the electrostatics of the region, and (iv) the proximity of main chain amide dipoles (11Stephens P.J.

Complex II is an excellent model system to evaluate the effect of the type of quinone and potential of the iron-sulfur cluster in modulating electron transfer catalysis. Both E. coli SQR and QFR are capable of functioning with either benzo- or naphthoquinones (7Maklashina E. Cecchini G. Arch. Biochem.

In the present study, we used a combination of x-ray crystallography, EPR and visible spectroscopy, site-directed mutagenesis, and kinetic analysis to show that a side chain of an amino acid near the [3Fe-4S] cluster attenuates the Em of the cluster. We made equivalent substitutions in the SQR SdhB and QFR FrdB subunits to show that the solvent-exposed side chain of SdhB His-207/FrdB Thr-205 modulates the electronic properties of the [3Fe-4S] cluster and binding of quinones. Detergents dodecylmaltoside and C12E9 ( polyoxyethylene 9-lauryl ether) were obtained from Anatrace (Maumee, OH). Carboxin (5,6-dihydro-2-methyl-1,4-oxathiin-3-carboxanilide) was obtained from Duchefa Biochemie (Haarlem, The Netherlands). E. coli strain DW35 (ΔfrdABCD, sdhC::kan) was used as the host for expression of SQR as described (16Maklashina E. Berthold D.A. Cecchini G. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5989-5996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid pH3 (frdA+B+C+D+) was used for expression of wild-type QFR (17Westenberg D.J. Gunsalus R.P. Ackrell B.A. Sices H. Cecchini G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 815-822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and plasmid pFAS (PFRDsdhC+D+A+B+) was used for expression of wild-type SQR (16Maklashina E. Berthold D.A. Cecchini G. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5989-5996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations were introduced using the QuikChange (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) mutagenesis kit using pFAS or pH3 as templates (16Maklashina E. Berthold D.A. Cecchini G. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5989-5996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Primers for mutagenesis were obtained from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). The SdhB H207T substituted enzyme was expressed, purified, and crystallized following the published procedures (18Ruprecht J. Yankovskaya V. Maklashina E. Iwata S. Cecchini G. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 29836-29846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Initial crystals grown under conditions used for the wild-type enzyme were in a different space group, H3, and were perfect merohedral twins. Addition of organic additives promoted growth of untwinned crystals, in space group P212121, with cell dimensions similar to those of the crystals of wild-type enzyme. The crystals used for data collection were from SdhB H207T enzyme mixed in a 1:10 (v/v) ratio with the inhibitor carboxin (from a 10 mm stock solution in ethanol). The reservoir solution contained 0.1 m Tris (pH 8.5), 0.1 m Li2SO4, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.009% dodecylmaltoside, 3% 1,6-hexanediol, and 10% (w/v) PEG 4000. The crystals appeared overnight and were frozen within 4 days of setup using 30% glycerol as cryoprotectant and mounted with mesh LithoLoopsTM (Molecular Dimensions Ltd., Suffolk, UK) to support the large plate crystals. X-ray data were collected from frozen crystals at 100 K at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility beamline ID23-1. The data set was collected from three different positions on the crystal, to minimize the effects of radiation damage and increase the resolution of the complete data set, using a 100 × 100-μm beam.

Non-protein atoms were omitted from the search model and initial phase calculation. Difference maps (mFo − DFc) calculated from the initial phases confirmed the location of the mutation. Density for carboxin was clearly visible in the Q-site in 2mFo − DFc maps. Manual model building was performed using the program Coot (23Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar), and refinement was done using phenix.refine (24Afonine P.V. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adam P.D.

Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar). Strict non-crystallographic symmetry restraints were applied to the protein part of the model during refinement. Coordinates and restraints for carboxin were downloaded from the PRODRG server (25Schüttelkopf A.W. van Aalten D.M. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 1355-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (4360) Google Scholar). Ideal coordinates for the malate-like intermediate TEO were obtained from the HIC-Up data base (26Kleywegt G.J.

Water molecules were fitted using phenix.refine and Coot and validated using Coot. The model was refined to Rcryst = 21.7% and Rfree = 25.3%. TLS refinement (28Winn M.D. Isupov M.N. Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar) was implemented in the final stages of refinement, defining each chain in the asymmetric unit as a separate TLS group. This produced a model with a final Rcryst of 19.0% and Rfree of 22.2%. The TLS model was validated using TLSANL (29Howlin B. Butler S.A. Moss D.S. Harris G.W. Driessen H.P.C. J. Appl.

The side chain of SdhD Trp-113 was truncated at the Cβ atom because density for the side chain was poor, and it was not possible to model it as a common rotamer without introducing clashes with symmetry-related side chains.

Titrations of the heme and [3Fe-4S] cluster signals were carried out at pH 7.0 in a buffer containing 100 mm MOPS, 5 mm EDTA, and 1 mm malonate. Titrations of ubisemiquinone radical signals were carried out at pH 8.0 in an identical buffer except that Tricine was substituted for MOPS. The following redox mediators were used at a concentration of 25 μm: 2,6-dichlorindophenol, 1,2-naphthoquinone, toluylene blue, phenazine methosulfate, thionine, methylene blue, resorufin, indigotrisulfonate, indigocarmine, anthraquinone-2-sulfonic acid, and neutral red. EPR spectra were recorded using a Bruker ESP300E spectrometer. [3Fe-4S]1+,0 cluster and Fe3+ heme EPR spectra were recorded at 12 K (20-milliwatt microwave power and 100-kHz modulation frequency) using an Oxford Instruments ESR900 flowing helium cryostat. [3Fe-4S]1,+ and Fe3+ heme spectra were recorded at modulation amplitudes of 10 and 20 Gpp, respectively. Flavin and ubisemiquinone radical spectra were recorded at 150 K (microwave power of 20 milliwatts and a modulation amplitude of 2 Gpp at 100 kHz) using a Bruker liquid nitrogen cryostat (an ER4111 VT Variable Temperature Unit).

The standard assay medium contained 30 mm Bistris propane (pH range, 6.0–8.5), 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.006% detergent C12E9, and 3 mm potassium cyanide at 30 °C. The succinate oxidase reaction of SQR was monitored by the decrease of the absorbance at 600 nm in the presence of succinate, 1.5 mm phenazine ethosulfate, and 50 μm 2,6-dichloroindophenol (ϵ600 = 21.8 mm−1 cm−1 (pH 7.8)). The succinate-ferricyanide reductase activity of QFR was determined at 420 nm with 0.5 mm potassium ferricyanide (ϵ420 = 1 mm−1 cm−1) and 20 mm succinate. Fumarate reduction activities of QFR and SQR with quinol analogues were determined in a reaction coupled to DT diaphorase (NADH:quinone reductase) as described previously (7Maklashina E. Cecchini G. Arch. Biochem.

Protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) method (Pierce) with BSA as a standard in the presence of 1% (w/v) SDS. Heme b was determined by the pyridine hemochromogen method (38Berry E.A. Trumpower B.L. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). To investigate the effect of the redox potential of the [3Fe-4S] cluster on catalytic activity of complex II enzymes, two mutant proteins were constructed. The [3Fe-4S]1+,0 cluster in SQR has positively charged amino acid residues adjacent to one of the Cys ligands, whereas the lower redox potential cluster in QFR has uncharged polar side chains. Therefore, SdhB His-207 was mutated to a Thr residue, and the equivalent Thr residue in FrdB was mutated to His to mimic the SQR protein. The resulting SdhB H207T and FrdB T205H substituted enzymes were expressed in E. coli, and the yield and stability of the mutant proteins were equivalent to those of wild-type enzyme. To determine the structural effects of the SdhB H207T substitution, we determined the x-ray structure of the protein in the presence of the quinone-binding site inhibitor carboxin. The crystal structure shows that the SQR SdhB H207T substituted enzyme is folded in a stable conformation and that the folds of the individual subunits are essentially identical to those of the wild-type enzyme. SQR molecules form a tightly packed trimeric arrangement in the asymmetric unit as described for the wild-type enzyme (18Ruprecht J. Yankovskaya V. Maklashina E. Iwata S. Cecchini G. J. Biol.

The overall root mean square deviations for Cα atoms following superposition of chains A–D of the wild-type and mutant structures are 0.15 Å for SdhA, 0.15 Å for SdhB, 0.17 Å for SdhC, and 0.19 Å for SdhD. These values are within the estimated coordinate error of the two structures (0.27 Å for the SdhB H207T substituted structure and 0.19 Å for wild-type SQR-binding carboxin; see Table 1 here and supplemental Table 1 in Ref. 18Ruprecht J.

Analyzing the deviations for Cα atoms following superposition of individual chains does reveal some small but interesting changes around the site of the mutation.

Methodology/Principal Findings We constructed DNA plasmid encoding H5HA (A/Shenzhen/406H/06, subclade 2.3.4) and generated VLP expressing the same H5HA and N1NA. We then compared neutralizing antibody responses and immune protection elicited with heterologous DNA-VLP, homologous DNA-DNA and VLP-VLP prime-boost strategies against HPAI H5N1 viruses in mice. We demonstrate that DNA-VLP elicits the highest neutralizing antibody titers among the three prime-boost strategies, whereas DNA-DNA elicits higher neutralizing antibody titers than VLP-VLP. We show that although all three prime-boost strategies protect mice from death caused by 10 MLD50 of homologous and heterologous H5N1 challenge, only DNA-VLP and DNA-DNA protect mice from infection as manifested by no weight loss and no lung pathology. In addition, we show that although DNA-VLP and DNA-DNA protect mice from death caused by 1,000 MLD50 of homologous H5N1 challenge, only DNA-VLP protects mice from infection. Moreover, we show that after 1,000 MLD50 of heterologous H5N1 challenge, while all mice in PBS, VLP-VLP and DNA-DNA died, 3 of 6 mice in DNA-VLP actually survived. Finally, we show that DNA-VLP completely protects mice from infection after 1,000 MLD50 of homologous H5N1 challenge even when the challenge was administrated at 60 days post the boost. Conclusions/Significance These results provide strong support for clinical evaluation of heterologous DNA-VLP prime-boost strategy as a public health intervention against a possible H5N1 pandemic."

Natural killer T (NKT) cells are a rare subset of T cells with immune regulatory functions and are already activated in utero. To test the hypothesis that NKT cells are part of the regulatory network that sets the fetal Th2 predominance, percentages of Vα24+Vβ11+ NKT cells expressing Th1/Th2-related chemokine receptors (CKR) were assessed in cord blood. Furthermore, IL-4 and IFN-γ secreting NKT cells were quantified within the single CKR+ subsets. Results Cord blood NKT cells expressed the Th2-related CCR4 and CCR8 at significantly higher frequencies compared to peripheral blood NKT cells from adults, while CXCR3+ and CCR5+ cord blood NKT cells (Th1-related) were present at lower percentages. Within CD4negCD8neg (DN) NKT cells, the frequency of IL-4 producing NKT cells was significantly higher in cord blood, while frequencies of IFN-γ secreting DN NKT cells tended to be lower. A further subanalysis showed that the higher percentage of IL-4 secreting DN NKT cells was restricted to CCR3+, CCR4+, CCR5+, CCR6+, CCR7+, CCR8+ and CXCR4+ DN subsets in cord blood. This resulted in significantly decreased IFN-γ /IL-4 ratios of CCR3+, CCR6+ and CCR8+ cord blood DN NKT cells. Sequencing of VA24AJ18 T cell receptor (TCR) transcripts in sorted cord blood Vα24Vβ11 cells confirmed the invariant TCR alpha-chain ruling out the possibility that these cells represent an unusual subset of conventional T cells. Conclusions Despite the heterogeneity of cord blood NKT cells, we observed a clear Th2-bias at the phenotypic and functional level which was mainly found in the DN subset. Therefore, we speculate that NKT cells are important for the initiation and control of the fetal Th2 environment which is needed to maintain tolerance towards self-antigens as well as non-inherited maternal antigens."
https://openalex.org/W2062330247,"The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is the most important genomic region that contributes to the risk of graft versus host disease (GVHD) after haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Matching of MHC class I and II genes is essential for the success of transplantation. However, the MHC contains additional genes that also contribute to the risk of developing acute GVHD. It is difficult to identify these genes by genetic association studies alone due to linkage disequilibrium in this region. Therefore, we aimed to identify MHC genes and other genes involved in the pathophysiology of GVHD by mRNA expression profiling.To reduce the complexity of the task, we used genetically well-defined rat inbred strains and a rat skin explant assay, an in-vitro-model of the graft versus host reaction (GVHR), to analyze the expression of MHC, natural killer complex (NKC), and other genes in cutaneous GVHR. We observed a statistically significant and strong up or down regulation of 11 MHC, 6 NKC, and 168 genes encoded in other genomic regions, i.e. 4.9%, 14.0%, and 2.6% of the tested genes respectively. The regulation of 7 selected MHC and 3 NKC genes was confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR and in independent skin explant assays. In addition, similar regulations of most of the selected genes were observed in GVHD-affected skin lesions of transplanted rats and in human skin explant assays.We identified rat and human MHC and NKC genes that are regulated during GVHR in skin explant assays and could therefore serve as biomarkers for GVHD. Several of the respective human genes, including HLA-DMB, C2, AIF1, SPR1, UBD, and OLR1, are polymorphic. These candidates may therefore contribute to the genetic risk of GVHD in patients."
https://openalex.org/W2082462897,"Children with complex urogenital anomalies often require bladder reconstruction. Gastrointestinal tissues used in bladder augmentations exhibit a greatly increased risk of malignancy, and the bladder microenvironment may play a role in this carcinogenesis. Investigating the influences of the bladder microenvironment on gastrointestinal and urothelial cell cycle checkpoint activation and DNA damage response has been limited by the lack of an appropriate well-differentiated urothelial cell line system.To meet this need, we have developed a well-differentiated conditionally immortalized urothelial cell line by isolating it from the H-2K(b)-tsA58 transgenic mouse. These cells express a thermosensitive SV40 large T antigen that can be deactivated by adjustment of cell culture conditions, allowing the cell line to regain normal control of the cell cycle. The isolated urothelial cell line demonstrates a polygonal, dome-shaped morphology, expresses cytokeratin 18, and exhibits well-developed tight junctions. Adaptation of the urothelial cell line to hyperosmolal culture conditions induces expression of both cytokeratin 20 and uroplakin II, markers of a superficial urothelial cell or ""umbrella cell."" This cell line can be maintained indefinitely in culture under permissive conditions but when cultured under non-permissive conditions, large T antigen expression is reduced substantially, leading to increased p53 activity and reduced cellular proliferation.This new model of urothelial cells, along with gastrointestinal cell lines previously derived from the H-2K(b)-tsA58 transgenic mouse, will be useful for studying the potential mechanisms of carcinogenesis of the augmented bladder."
https://openalex.org/W2080019120,"The application of a rapid and direct proteotyping approach with which to identify the gene origin of viral antigens in a reassortant influenza strain is demonstrated. The reassortant strain, constructed for a vaccine against type A 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza, contains genes derived from a wild-type pandemic strain (A/California/7/2009) and an egg adapted high-growth strain (denoted NYMC X-157) derived from an earlier A/Puerto Rico/8/34 strain. The proteotyping approach employs modern proteomics methods and high resolution mass spectrometry to correctly establish that the genes of the surface antigens, hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, are derived from the A/California/7/2009 strain while those for nucleoprotein and matrix protein M1 antigens are derived from the NYMC X-157 strain. This is achieved for both gel-separated antigens and those from a whole vaccine digest. Furthermore, signature peptides detected in the mass spectra of the digested antigens enable the engineered reassortant strain to be identified as a type A virus of the H1N1 subtype in accord with earlier studies. The results demonstrate that proteotyping approach provides a more direct and rapid approach over RT-PCR with which to characterize reassortant strains of the influenza virus at the molecular protein level. Given that these strains pose the greatest risk to human and animal health and have been responsible for all human pandemics of the 20th and 21st centuries, there is a vital need for the origins and evolutionary history of these strains to be rapidly established."
