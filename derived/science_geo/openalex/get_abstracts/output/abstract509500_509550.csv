Our results establish CRISPRi and CRISPRa as powerful tools that provide rich and complementary information for mapping complex pathways. Dramatic advances in sequencing technology have cataloged a universe of transcribed loci—greatly exceeding the number of canonical protein-coding open reading frames (ORFs)—which collectively are responsible for carrying out the instructions encoded by the genome (Djebali et al., 2012Djebali S. Davis C.A. Merkel A. Dobin A. Lassmann T. Mortazavi A. Tanzer A. Lagarde J. Lin W. Schlesinger F. et al.Landscape of transcription in human cells.Nature. 2012; 489: 101-108Google Scholar). A central challenge now is to understand the biological role of these transcripts and how quantitative differences in their expression define cellular states in normal development and in disease. Despite intense efforts, the function of many protein-coding genes remains poorly defined. Even less is known about the biological roles of most noncanonical transcripts such as enhancer RNAs, upstream antisense RNAs, lncRNAs, or other intergenic RNAs (Cech and Steitz, 2014Cech T.R. Steitz J.A. The noncoding RNA revolution-trashing old rules to forge new ones.Cell. 2014; 157: 77-94Google Scholar). Efforts to address this deficiency in our knowledge would be greatly aided by techniques that are capable of dynamically and precisely controlling the expression of individual transcripts. One way to explore the function of genes is to disrupt their expression through repression. The dominant tool for programmed knockdown of mRNAs is RNA interference (RNAi) (Chang et al., 2006Chang K. Elledge S.J. Hannon G.J. Lessons from Nature: microRNA-based shRNA libraries.Nat. Methods. 2006; 3: 707-714Google Scholar). However, RNAi has pervasive problems with off-target effects, which can be especially confounding in the context of large-scale screens (Adamson et al., 2012Adamson B. Smogorzewska A. Sigoillot F.D.

Quattrochi B. King R.W. A bioinformatics method identifies prominent off-targeted transcripts in RNAi screens.Nat. Methods. 2012; 9: 363-366Google Scholar). Additionally, because RNAi is mediated by cytoplasmic argounaute proteins, gene silencing through this approach is best suited to depletion of cytosolic mRNA targets. An alternative emerging strategy is the use of programmable genome editing methods that permanently delete or modify DNA using designable, sequence-specific endonucleases such as zinc finger, transcription activator-like effector (TALE) nucleases, or CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)/Cas9 (CRISPR-associated protein 9) proteins (Gaj et al., 2013Gaj T.

CRISPR-Cas systems for editing, regulating and targeting genomes.Nat. Biotechnol. 2014; 32: 347-355Google Scholar). A series of elegant studies recently exploited the readily programmable nature of Cas9, in which the specificity is determined by a short guide (sg)RNA, to enable genome-scale loss-of-function screens (Koike-Yusa et al., 2014Koike-Yusa H. Li Y. Tan E.-P. Velasco-Herrera Mdel.C. Yusa K. Genome-wide recessive genetic screening in mammalian cells with a lentiviral CRISPR-guide RNA library.Nat.

Genetic screens in human cells using the CRISPR-Cas9 system.Science. 2014; 343: 80-84Google Scholar). These studies established CRISPR-mediated cutting as a powerful screening technology complementary to RNAi and haploid mutagenesis screens (Carette et al., 2009Carette J.E. Guimaraes C.P. Varadarajan M. Park A.S. Wuethrich I. Godarova A. Kotecki M. Cochran B.H. Spooner E. Ploegh H.L. Brummelkamp T.R. Haploid genetic screens in human cells identify host factors used by pathogens.Science. 2009; 326: 1231-1235Google Scholar). Nonetheless, screening approaches based on genome editing are currently focused on loss-of-function studies involving irreversible frameshift disruptions, limiting their utility for the study of essential genes and long noncoding RNAs. Additionally, double-stranded DNA breaks can be cytotoxic (Huang et al., 1996Huang L.C. Clarkin K.C. Wahl G.M. Sensitivity and selectivity of the DNA damage sensor responsible for activating p53-dependent G1 arrest.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1996; 93: 4827-4832Google Scholar, Jackson, 2002Jackson S.P. Sensing and repairing DNA double-strand breaks.Carcinogenesis. 2002; 23: 687-696Google Scholar). Finally, indels formed from error-prone DNA repair are often short and in-frame, which could limit the ability to disable all of the alleles of a gene. A programmable DNA-binding protein that can recruit an effector domain to turn transcription on and off in a dynamic and quantitative manner offers, in principle, a more flexible tool for interrogating the many transcripts in complex genomes. Pioneering experiments with designed chimeric zinc finger and TALE proteins fused to transcription effector domains demonstrate that such an approach can modulate transcription of endogenous genes (Beerli et al., 1998Beerli R.R. Segal D.J. Dreier B. Barbas 3rd, C.F. Toward controlling gene expression at will: specific regulation of the erbB-2/HER-2 promoter by using polydactyl zinc finger proteins constructed from modular building blocks.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Efficient construction of sequence-specific TAL effectors for modulating mammalian transcription.Nat. Biotechnol. 2011; 29: 149-153Google Scholar). However, as each transcript target requires a unique fusion protein, expanding these methods to genome-scale is arduous. Recently, we and others have used catalytically inactive Cas9 (dCas9) fusion proteins guided by gene-specific sgRNAs to localize effector domains to specific DNA sequences to either repress (CRISPRi) or activate (CRISPRa) transcription of target genes (Gilbert et al., 2013Gilbert L.A. Larson M.H. Morsut L. Liu Z. Brar G.A. Torres S.E. Stern-Ginossar N. Brandman O. Whitehead E.H. Doudna J.A. et al.CRISPR-mediated modular RNA-guided regulation of transcription in eukaryotes.Cell. 2013; 154: 442-451Google Scholar, Sander and Joung, 2014Sander J.D. Joung J.K. CRISPR-Cas systems for editing, regulating and targeting genomes.Nat. Biotechnol. 2014; 32: 347-355Google Scholar). To date, a small number of sgRNAs have been tested, leaving unanswered whether CRISPRi/a is a feasible strategy for globally interrogating gene function and, if so, how best to target a gene to activate or repress transcription while minimizing off-target effects. Here, we describe the development and application of a method for high-specificity, genome-scale modulation of transcription of endogenous genes in human cells using CRISPRi/a. To accomplish this, we first performed a saturating screen in which we tested the activity of every unique sgRNA broadly tiling around the transcription start sites (TSSs) of 49 genes known to modulate cellular susceptibility to ricin (Bassik et al., 2013Bassik M.C. Kampmann M. Lebbink R.J. Wang S. Hein M.Y. Poser I. Weibezahn J. Horlbeck M.A. Chen S. Mann M. et al.A systematic mammalian genetic interaction map reveals pathways underlying ricin susceptibility.Cell. 2013; 152: 909-922Google Scholar). From this, we extracted distinct rules for regions where either CRISPRi or CRISPRa maximally changes the expression of endogenous genes, as well as rules for predicting off-target effects, providing an algorithm to design two genome-scale libraries targeting each gene with 10 sgRNAs. We validated these libraries by screening for genes that control cell growth and response to a chimeric cholera/diphtheria fusion toxin (CTx-DTA) (Guimaraes et al., 2011Guimaraes C.P. Carette J.E. Varadarajan M. Antos J. Popp M.W. Spooner E. Brummelkamp T.R. Ploegh H.L. Identification of host cell factors required for intoxication through use of modified cholera toxin.J. Cell Biol. 2011; 195: 751-764Google Scholar). These experiments demonstrate that our CRISPRi/a screening platform is robust, showing high reproducibility and activity with undetectable intrinsic toxicity. More generally, we establish that transcriptional repression is inducible, reversible, and can target essential genes. We demonstrate that we can use CRISPRi and CRISPRa to control transcript levels for endogenous genes across a wide dynamic range. We also provide extensive evidence that properly designed CRISPRi reagents are highly specific. As such, these methods represent transformative tools for defining transcript function across the breadth of transcripts encoded by the human genome. CRISPRi can repress transcription by directly blocking RNA polymerase activity (dCas9) or through effector domain-mediated transcriptional silencing (dCas9-KRAB) (Gilbert et al., 2013Gilbert L.A. Larson M.H. Morsut L. Liu Z. Brar G.A. Torres S.E. Stern-Ginossar N. Brandman O. Whitehead E.H. Doudna J.A. et al.CRISPR-mediated modular RNA-guided regulation of transcription in eukaryotes.Cell. 2013; 154: 442-451Google Scholar, Qi et al., 2013Qi L.S. Larson M.H. Gilbert L.A. Doudna J.A. Weissman J.S. Arkin A.P. Lim W.A. Repurposing CRISPR as an RNA-guided platform for sequence-specific control of gene expression.Cell. 2013; 152: 1173-1183Google Scholar). In order to better understand and optimize CRISPRi activity, we used a pooled high-throughput screen to define rules that determine CRISPRi repression of endogenous genes. We targeted 49 genes that we had previously shown to modulate cellular susceptibility to the AB toxin ricin (Bassik et al., 2013Bassik M.C. Kampmann M. Lebbink R.J. Wang S. Hein M.Y. Poser I. Weibezahn J. Horlbeck M.A. Chen S. Mann M. et al.A systematic mammalian genetic interaction map reveals pathways underlying ricin susceptibility.Cell. 2013; 152: 909-922Google Scholar). The extent of gene repression for these genes typically has a monotonic relationship with the ricin-resistance phenotype, allowing us to use a ricin-resistance score calculated by monitoring sgRNA frequencies in a pooled screen to indirectly measure transcriptional repression. Using massively parallel oligonucleotide synthesis, we generated a library of sgRNAs that tile the DNA in a 10-kilobase window around the TSS of these 49 genes (54,810 total sgRNAs) (Bassik et al., 2009Bassik M.C. Lebbink R.J. Churchman L.S. Ingolia N.T. Patena W. LeProust E.M. Schuldiner M. Weissman J.S. McManus M.T. Rapid creation and quantitative monitoring of high coverage shRNA libraries.Nat. Methods. 2009; 6: 443-445Google Scholar) (Figure 1A). We also included 1,000 negative control sgRNAs derived from scrambled sequences corresponding to the same windows. We packaged this tiling library of sgRNAs into lentiviral particles and transduced K562 human myeloid leukemia cells stably expressing dCas9 or a dCas9-KRAB fusion protein, which we have previously described (Gilbert et al., 2013Gilbert L.A. Larson M.H. Morsut L. Liu Z. Brar G.A. Torres S.E. Stern-Ginossar N. Brandman O. Whitehead E.H. Doudna J.A. et al.CRISPR-mediated modular RNA-guided regulation of transcription in eukaryotes.Cell. 2013; 154: 442-451Google Scholar). We harvested populations of cells expressing the library either at the outset of the experiment, after growth under standard conditions, or following ricin treatment. We then counted the frequency of each sgRNA in the library in each sample using deep sequencing to determine how each sgRNA in the library modulates cell growth and cellular susceptibility to ricin phenotypes. We defined these phenotypes quantitatively as gamma (γ) and rho (ρ), respectively (See Figure S1A, available online, and Kampmann et al., 2013Kampmann M. Bassik M.C. Weissman J.S. Integrated platform for genome-wide screening and construction of high-density genetic interaction maps in mammalian cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110: E2317-E2326Google Scholar). Many sgRNAs potently repress gene expression, as evidenced by their impact on ricin sensitivity (Figures 1B and S2A). Plotting this data for all 49 genes showed that active sgRNAs cluster around or just downstream from the TSS of each gene for dCas9-KRAB and dCas9, respectively (Figure 1C). We saw that strong CRISPRi activity is obtained by targeting dCas9-KRAB to a window of DNA from −50 to +300 bp relative to the TSS of a gene, with a maximum in the ∼50–100 bp region just downstream of the TSS (Figures 1C and 1D). This suggested that optimal activity leverages the combined activity of dCas9 interference along with repression from the KRAB domain. We also observed that sgRNAs with protospacer lengths of 18–21 base pairs were significantly more active than sgRNAs containing longer protospacers (Figure S2B). Nucleotide homopolymers had a strongly negative effect on sgRNA activity (Figure S2D). However, neither the DNA strand that was targeted nor the sgRNA GC content across a broad range strongly correlated with sgRNA activity (Figures S2C and S2E). To evaluate the feasibility of genome-scale genetic screens based on CRISPRi, we compared the strength of phenotypes obtained with CRISPRi to our previously published shRNA data. We applied the rules described above to data from our sgRNA tiling library to select all sgRNAs predicted to be highly active and then randomly subsampled sets of 10 or 24 sgRNAs. We calculated a normalized phenotype Z score by dividing mean phenotypes for each gene by the standard deviation of sgRNA phenotypes from the nontargeting control set (Figure S1B). We see significant ricin phenotypes for each of the 49 genes. Moreover, in virtually every case the normalized ricin phenotype Z score or p value is stronger (in many cases far stronger) than seen with a comparably-sized shRNA library (generated by subsampling our published data) (Figures 1E and S2F). To assess CRISPRi off-target activity at endogenous genes, we selected a set of 30 sgRNAs from our tiling library (6 sgRNAs/gene targeting five genes). For each of these sgRNAs, we tested the activity of a series of derivative sgRNAs with a variable number and position of mismatches (Figure 2). This experiment allowed us to measure the relative amount of gene repression for sgRNAs with or without mismatch base pairing targeting the same DNA locus. We found that even a single mismatch at the 3′ end of the protospacer decreased CRISPRi activity on average, while combinations of mismatches that pass our off-target filter abolished activity (Figures 2, and S3, and Extended Experimental Procedures). From this analysis, we concluded that properly designed CRISPRi sgRNAs have minimal off-target transcriptional repression activity.Figure S3CRISPRi Activity is Highly Sensitive to Mismatches Between the sgRNA and DNA Sequence, Related to Figure 2Show full captionThe on- and off- target activity of dCas9, dCas9-KRAB and Cas9 was measured for a series of sgRNAs with a varying number and position of mismatches.

We recently developed an improved CRISPRa method, termed sunCas9, in which expression of a single sgRNA with one binding site is sufficient to robustly activate transcription (Tanenbaum et al., 2014Tanenbaum M.E. Gilbert L.A. Qi L.S. Weissman J.S. Vale R.D. A versatile protein tagging system for signal amplification in single molecule imaging and gene regulation.Cell. 2014; 159 (this issue): 635-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (913) Google Scholar, this issue). In the sunCas9 system, a single dCas9 fusion protein bound to DNA recruits multiple copies of the activating effector domain, thus amplifying our ability to induce transcription (Figure 3A). To define rules for optimal CRISPRa sgRNA design, we used our tiling library, which targets genes capable of modulating cellular sensitivity to ricin. We previously showed for several of the genes in this tiling library that knockdown and plasmid overexpression resulted in opposite ricin phenotypes (Bassik et al., 2013Bassik M.C. Kampmann M. Lebbink R.J. Wang S. Hein M.Y. Poser I. Weibezahn J. Horlbeck M.A. Chen S. Mann M. et al.A systematic mammalian genetic interaction map reveals pathways underlying ricin susceptibility.Cell. 2013; 152: 909-922Google Scholar). For example, knockdown of SEC23B sensitized cells to ricin, whereas SEC23B overexpression desensitized cells to ricin. These observations suggested that we should be able to observe reversed phenotypes in this tiling screen arising from CRISPRa activity. We transduced K562 cells stably expressing the sunCas9 system (Figure 3A) with the sgRNA tiling library and screened for ricin phenotypes as described for CRISPRi above. Analysis of data for individual genes or averaged data for all 49 genes demonstrated that many sgRNAs for each gene affected ricin resistance (Figures 3B, S4A, and S4B). Our negative control sgRNAs showed very little activity and were not correlated between biological replicate screens, suggesting that CRISPRa activity is specific. We observed a peak of active sgRNAs for CRISPRa at −400 to −50 bp upstream from the TSS (Figure 3B). This activity pattern fits with a model in which each VP16 domain can bind the mediator complex and recruit basal transcription machinery, activating transcription when spaced appropriately from a TSS (Mittler et al., 2003Mittler G. Stühler T. Santolin L. Uhlmann T. Kremmer E. Lottspeich F. Berti L. Meisterernst M. A novel docking site on Mediator is critical for activation by VP16 in mammalian cells.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6494-6504Google Scholar). With this system, we have shown we can turn on genes that are poorly expressed and increase the expression of well-expressed genes (Figure 3E). Overall, our CRISPRi/a tiling screens provide rules for how CRISPRi/a controls expression of endogenous genes. For many genes, we do not know how the relative abundance of the encoded protein relates to its function. We observed a marked anticorrelation in our ricin screens between CRISPRa phenotypes and CRISPRi phenotypes for individual genes (Figure 3C). As the genes targeted by our tiling library were selected based on a knockdown phenotype, all genes showed phenotypes in the CRISPRi screen, but only a subset showed phenotypes in the CRISPRa screen. To validate results from both the CRISPRi and CRISPRa tiling screens, we selected an allelic series of sgRNAs by phenotype from the screen and retested each sgRNA individually (38 sgRNAs targeting four genes). Our results show that our CRISPRi/a screens produced reliable phenotype scores, robustly reproduced upon retesting, and that CRISPRi/a can activate and repress the transcription of endogenous genes over a wide dynamic range (up to ∼1,000-fold) (Figures 3D and 3E), enabling systematic interrogation of how gene dosage controls cellular functions of interest. The results of our tiling CRISPRi screen established our ability to pick active sgRNAs with low off-target activity and provided a set of rules enabling us to design a robust genome-scale sgRNA library. We chose a library size of 10 sgRNAs/gene for the following reasons. Over half of the sgRNAs conforming to these rules gave clear ricin phenotypes. For a library with 10 sgRNAs/gene, 94% of the genes would thus have 2 or more highly active sgRNAs. Finally, computational subsampling of the phenotypic data from our tiling library data to 10 sgRNAs/gene and calculation of Z scores for hit genes indicated that a library with 10 sgRNAs/gene would reliably detect hit genes (Figure 1E). We synthesized and cloned a genome-scale CRISPRi sgRNA library targeting 15,977 human protein-coding genes (10 sgRNAs/TSS, targeting 20,898 TSS) with 11,219 nontargeting control sgRNAs for a total of 206,421 sgRNAs (Table S2). To evaluate this library, we first screened for genes essential for cell growth in K562 cells. Briefly, K562 cells stably expressing dCas9-KRAB were transduced in replicate with the entire genome-scale library, and each replicate was grown for 10 days at a minimum library coverage of 3,750 cells/sgRNA in a single spinner flask. To characterize our screening methodology and library design, we examined the correlation between screen replicates. Individual sgRNAs reproducibly showed dramatic depletion (up to 256-fold) over a 10 day screen, demonstrating that individual sgRNAs can have profound effects on cell growth (Table S2) (Figure 4A). The distribution of our negative control sgRNAs was very narrow with little correlation between replicates (Spearman R = 0.036), suggesting that the off-target activity of these controls is very low (Figure 4A). Indeed, 99.7% of our negative controls had no detectable activity. The observed specificity is consistent with our previously published RNA-seq data (Gilbert et al., 2013Gilbert L.A. Larson M.H. Morsut L. Liu Z. Brar G.A. Torres S.E. Stern-Ginossar N. Brandman O. Whitehead E.H. Doudna J.A. et al.CRISPR-mediated modular RNA-guided regulation of transcription in eukaryotes.Cell. 2013; 154: 442-451Google Scholar). To further explore the prevalence of off-target effects, we examined two classes of genes not expected to show any on-target activity in our screen: olfactory receptors and genes on the Y chromosome. The sgRNAs that target these genes were designed and picked in the same manner as the rest of the library; however, olfactory receptors should not be expressed in this cell type and, as K562 cells are derived from a female donor, sgRNAs that target genes on the Y chromosome lack a DNA target. As with the negative controls, these genes show no phenotype on average and exhibit very little correlation between replicates (Spearman R = 0.057 for olfactory genes and −0.052 for Y targeting) (Figure 4A). We also observed no evidence of nonspecific toxicity due to expression of dCas9-KRAB and our sgRNA library in K562 cells, suggesting that dCas9 bound to the genome is not toxic under these conditions (Figure 4B). Thus, CRISPRi is highly specific and nontoxic. To identify hit genes in this screen, we used a metric of average growth phenotype (γ) for the top three sgRNAs for each gene (see Experimental Procedures and Table S3). Among the top hits were genes involved in essential cellular functions, including translation, transcription, and DNA replication (Figures 4C and S5A) (Huang et al., 2009aHuang W. Sherman B.T. Lempicki R.A. Systematic and integrative analysis of large gene lists using DAVID bioinformatics resources.Nat. Protoc. 2009; 4: 44-57Google Scholar, Huang et al., 2009bHuang W. Sherman B.T. Lempicki R.A. Bioinformatics enrichment tools: paths toward the comprehensive functional analysis of large gene lists.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: 1-13Google Scholar), thus validating our approach as a screening platform. The results of our CRISPRa tiling screen established our ability to confidently measure gene phenotypes resulting from inducing expression with single sgRNAs. As with the CRISPRi tiling screens, our data enabled the development of a set of rules that allowed construction of a genome-scale CRISPRa library. Many of these rules overlapped with those of CRISPRi (e.g., sgRNA length and sequence preferences). A key difference is that the optimal window for targeting sgRNAs for CRISPRa lies upstream of the TSS (Figure 3B). We therefore constructed an independent CRISPRa library, designing 10 sgRNAs between −400 to −50 base pairs upstream of each TSS for 15,977 human genes, along with 5,968 nontargeting control sgRNAs, for a total of 198,810 sgRNAs. We evaluated our CRISPRa platform in a screen for genes that affect cell growth when induced in K562 cells constitutively expressing the sunCas9 system. Replicate screens were conducted as described above. The magnitude of growth defects seen in our CRISPRa screen was comparable to that of the above CRISPRi screen, although fewer sgRNAs caused a growth phenotype (Figure S5B and Table S2). We analyzed control sgRNAs with no genomic target or Y chromosome targets and found minimal phenotypes, which lacked substantial correlation between experimental replicates (Spearman R = 0.155 and R = 0.010, respectively), indicating that the phenotype distribution observed in nontargeting controls was primarily a result of stochastic noise rather than off-target effects. Furthermore, the fraction of cells expressing sgRNAs and the sunCas9 system was stable over the course of the experiment, indicating that there was no general toxicity associated with the CRISPRa platform (Figure 4B). These data suggest that, like CRISPRi, CRISPRa is specific and nontoxic. We then investigated the genes whose induction caused cells to deplete over the course of our CRISPRa screen. We scored genes by the average γ of the three most active sgRNAs as above, and compared these phenotypes to those observed in the CRISPRi screen (Figure 4D and Tab"

Harnessing this principle, we have developed a protein scaffold, a repeating peptide array termed SunTag, which can recruit multiple copies of an antibody-fusion protein. We show that the SunTag can recruit up to 24 copies of GFP, thereby enabling long-term imaging of single protein molecules in living cells. We also use the SunTag to create a potent synthetic transcription factor by recruiting multiple copies of a transcriptional activation domain to a nuclease-deficient CRISPR/Cas9 protein and demonstrate strong activation of endogenous gene expression and re-engineered cell behavior with this system. Thus, the SunTag provides a versatile platform for multimerizing proteins on a target protein scaffold and is likely to have many applications in imaging and controlling biological outputs. Signals in many biological processes can be amplified by recruiting multiple copies of regulatory proteins to a site of action. Harnessing this principle, we have developed a protein scaffold, a repeating peptide array termed SunTag, which can recruit multiple copies of an antibody-fusion protein. We show that the SunTag can recruit up to 24 copies of GFP, thereby enabling long-term imaging of single protein molecules in living cells. We also use the SunTag to create a potent synthetic transcription factor by recruiting multiple copies of a transcriptional activation domain to a nuclease-deficient CRISPR/Cas9 protein and demonstrate strong activation of endogenous gene expression and re-engineered cell behavior with this system. Thus, the SunTag provides a versatile platform for multimerizing proteins on a target protein scaffold and is likely to have many applications in imaging and controlling biological outputs. Recruitment of multiple copies of a protein to a target substrate (e.g., DNA, RNA, or protein) presents a general principle for signal amplification in biological systems. For example, binding of multiple copies of a transcription factor to a single promoter dramatically enhances transcriptional activation of the target gene (Anderson and Freytag, 1991Anderson G.M.

Biol. 1990; 214: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Similarly, the recruitment of multiple copies of an RNA-binding protein to an mRNA can result in potent regulation of translation (Pillai et al., 2004Pillai R.S. Artus C.G. Filipowicz W. Tethering of human Ago proteins to mRNA mimics the miRNA-mediated repression of protein synthesis.RNA. 2004; 10: 1518-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, Piqué et al., 2008Piqué M.

Protein localization and interactions also can be modulated by the copy number of interaction sites within a polypeptide sequence. For example, many nuclear proteins contain multiple nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequences, which control robustness of nuclear import (Luo et al., 2004Luo M. Pang C.W. Gerken A.E. Brock T.G. Multiple nuclear localization sequences allow modulation of 5-lipoxygenase nuclear import.Traffic. 2004; 5: 847-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The principle of signal amplification via protein multimerization has also been widely used in imaging and engineering of biological systems. A commonly used method to study RNA localization, even at the single-molecule level, is to insert multiple copies (as many as 24) of the MS2-binding RNA hairpin into a target RNA molecule, which then recruits many MS2-GFP fusion proteins, fluorescently labeling the RNA molecule with many GFP molecules (Bertrand et al., 1998Bertrand E. Chartrand P. Schaefer M. Shenoy S.M. Singer R.H. Long R.M. Localization of ASH1 mRNA particles in living yeast.Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 437-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1157) Google Scholar, Fusco et al., 2003Fusco D. Accornero N. Lavoie B. Shenoy S.M. Blanchard J.M. Singer R.H. Bertrand E. Single mRNA molecules demonstrate probabilistic movement in living mammalian cells.Curr. Bio. 2003; 13: 161-167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). The activity of a RNA-binding protein can also be studied by artificially tethering it to an RNA in multiple copies using the MS2 system (Coller and Wickens, 2007Coller J. Wickens M. Tethered function assays: an adaptable approach to study RNA regulatory proteins.Methods Enzymol. 2007; 429: 299-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Similar multimerization approaches have also been used to fluorescently label a specific region of a chromosome. For example, the LacO operon can be inserted into a chromosomal locus in many tandem repeats and then visualized by the recruitment of many copies of GFP-LacI (Gordon et al., 1997Gordon G.S. Sitnikov D. Webb C.D. Teleman A. Straight A. Losick R. Murray A.W. Wright A. Chromosome and low copy plasmid segregation in E. coli: visual evidence for distinct mechanisms.Cell. 1997; 90: 1113-1121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). GFP-tagged DNA-binding proteins, such as the CRISPR-associated protein Cas9, can also be used to fluorescently label a native repetitive DNA sequence, as such repetitive sequences recruit many copies of the GFP-tagged DNA-binding proteins (Chen et al., 2013Chen B. Gilbert L.A. Cimini B.A. Schnitzbauer J. Zhang W. Li G.W. Park J. Blackburn E.H. Weissman J.S. Qi L.S. Huang B. Dynamic imaging of genomic loci in living human cells by an optimized CRISPR/Cas system.Cell. 2013; 155: 1479-1491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1259) Google Scholar). Furthermore, as with native transcriptional regulation, a gene can be artificially activated when a binding site for a synthetic transcription factor is placed upstream of a gene in multiple copies; this principle is employed in the “Tet-On” system for inducible transgene expression (Huang et al., 1999Huang C.J. Spinella F. Nazarian R. Lee M.M. Dopp J.M. de Vellis J. Expression of green fluorescent protein in oligodendrocytes in a time- and level-controllable fashion with a tetracycline-regulated system.Mol. Med. 1999; 5: 129-137PubMed Google Scholar, Sadowski et al., 1988Sadowski I. Ma J. Triezenberg S. Ptashne M. GAL4-VP16 is an unusually potent transcriptional activator.Nature. 1988; 335: 563-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies demonstrate the power of introducing multiple copies of protein-binding sites within RNA or DNA for the purpose of signal amplification. Despite the success of multimerizing nucleic-acid-based motifs within RNA and DNA, for protein recruitment, no comparable and generic system exists for controlling copy number of protein-protein interactions. For fluorescence imaging, fusion of three copies of GFP to a protein of interest has been used to increase signal intensity, but a further increase in the copy number of fluorescent proteins is challenging due to their size (∼25 kDa) and bacterial recombination when constructing DNA plasmids encoding such proteins. Here, we describe a synthetic system for recruiting as many as 24 copies of a protein to a target polypeptide chain. We demonstrate that this approach can be used to create bright fluorescent signals for single-molecule protein imaging in living cells through the recruitment of 24 copies of GFP to a target protein. We also demonstrate that the system can be used to modulate gene expression through the recruitment of multiple copies of gene regulatory effector domains to a nuclease-deficient CRISPR/Cas9 protein targeted to specific sequences in the genome. The ability to amplify biological signals through controlled protein multimerization will likely have many additional uses in biological research and biotechnology. Protein multimerization on a single RNA or DNA template is made possible by identifying protein domains that bind with high affinity to a relatively short nucleic acid motif. We therefore sought a protein-based system with similar properties, specifically a protein that can bind tightly to a short peptide sequence (Figures 1A and 1B ). Antibodies are capable of binding to short, unstructured peptide sequences with high affinity and specificity, and, importantly, peptide epitopes can be designed that differ from naturally occurring sequences in the genome. Furthermore, whereas antibodies generally do not fold properly in the cytoplasm, single-chain variable fragment (scFv) antibodies, in which the epitope-binding regions of the light and heavy chains of the antibody are fused to form a single polypeptide, have been successfully expressed in soluble form in cells (Colby et al., 2004Colby D.W.

We expressed three previously developed single-chain antibodies (Colby et al., 2004Colby D.W. Garg P. Holden T. Chao G. Webster J.M. Messer A. Ingram V.M. Wittrup K.D.

Chem. 2000; 275: 2795-2803Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) fused to EGFP in U2OS cells and coexpressed their cognate peptides (multimerized in four tandem copies) fused to the cytoplasmic side of the mitochondrial protein mitoNEET (Colca et al., 2004Colca J.R.

Metab. 2004; 286: E252-E260Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) (referred to here as Mito, Figure S1A). We then assayed whether the antibody-GFP fusion proteins would be recruited to the mitochondria by fluorescence microscopy, which would indicate binding between antibody and peptide (Figure 1B). Of the three antibody-peptide pairs tested, only the GCN4 antibody-peptide pair showed robust and specific binding while not disrupting normal mitochondrial morphology (Figures 1C and S1B). Thus, we focused our further efforts on the GCN4 antibody-peptide pair. The GCN4 antibody was optimized to allow intracellular expression in yeast (Wörn et al., 2000Wörn A. Auf der Maur A. Escher D. Honegger A. Barberis A. Plückthun A. Correlation between in vitro stability and in vivo performance of anti-GCN4 intrabodies as cytoplasmic inhibitors.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2795-2803Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In human cells, however, we still observed some protein aggregates of scFv-GCN4-GFP at high expression levels (Figure S2A). To improve scFv-GCN4 stability, we added a variety of N- and C-terminal fusion proteins known to enhance protein solubility and found that fusion of superfolder-GFP (sfGFP) alone (Pédelacq et al., 2006Pédelacq J.D. Cabantous S. Tran T. Terwilliger T.C. Waldo G.S. Engineering and characterization of a superfolder green fluorescent protein.Nat. Biotechnol. 2006; 24: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar) or along with the small solubility tag GB1 (Gronenborn et al., 1991Gronenborn A.M. Filpula D.R. Essig N.Z. Achari A. Whitlow M. Wingfield P.T. Clore G.M. A novel, highly stable fold of the immunoglobulin binding domain of streptococcal protein G.Science. 1991; 253: 657-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar) to the C terminus of the GCN4 antibody almost completely eliminated protein aggregation, even at high expression levels (Figure S2A). Thus, we performed all further experiments with scFv-GCN4-sfGFP-GB1 (hereafter referred to as scFv-GCN4-GFP). Very tight binding of the antibody-peptide pair in vivo is critical for the formation of multimers on a protein scaffold backbone. To determine the dissociation rate of the GCN4 antibody-peptide interaction, we performed fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments on scFv-GCN4-GFP bound to the mitochondrial-localized mito-mCherry-4xGCN4pep. After photobleaching, very slow GFP recovery was observed (half-life of ∼5–10 min [Figures 2A and 2B ]), indicating that the antibody bound very tightly to the peptide. It is also important to optimize the spacing of the scFv-GCN4 binding sites within the protein scaffold so that they could be saturated by scFv-GCN4 because steric hindrance of neighboring peptide binding sites is a concern. We varied the spacing between neighboring GCN4 peptides and quantified the antibody occupancy on the peptide array using the mitochondrial localization assay described above combined with quantitative fluorescence microscopy (Figures 2C–2E and S2B). The ratio of GFP fluorescence (from the scFv-GCN4-GFP antibody) to mCherry fluorescence (present in one copy on the mito-4xGCN4pep scaffold) on the mitochondria provided a measure of the number of antibodies recruited to the protein scaffold. To correct for different intensities of the two fluorescent proteins, this ratio was normalized to the GFP-mCherry fluorescence intensity ratio of a control protein in which GFP and mCherry were directly fused (Figure S2B). We compared a short (GGSGG) and long (GGSGGSGGSGGSGG) linker separating the 22 aa GCN4 peptide and found an average GFP:mCherry corrected intensity ratio of 3.4 ± 1.5 and 4.1 ± 1.6, respectively (n = 40 cells) (Figures 2C–2E). Complete saturation of all binding sites would result in a GFP:mCherry molar ratio of 4, whereas a maximal molar ratio of 2 is expected if two antibodies could not bind to adjacent peptides due to steric hindrance. Thus, the results from this experiment indicate that a spacer as short as five amino acids sufficiently separates peptides to allow binding of antibodies to neighboring peptides. Importantly, in a peptide array containing 24 tandem copies of the peptide, separated by five aa linkers, we found an average GFP:mCherry corrected fluorescence intensity ratio of 24 (Figures 2C and 2E). These results show that full antibody occupancy can be achieved with as many as 24 copies of a peptide binding site. Taken together, these results show that this optimized GCN4 antibody-peptide pair meets all the requirements for an effective system for recruiting many copies of a protein to a polypeptide scaffold in a controlled fashion. As the GCN4 antibody-peptide pair allows ultrabright fluorescent labeling of molecules, we named the tagging system SUperNova (SunTag) after the very bright stellar explosion. Single-molecule imaging is a powerful emerging tool in cell biology; in our first application of the SunTag, we tested whether SunTag24x (24 copies of the peptide binding site) could be used for single-molecule imaging in living cells (all imaging in this study was performed at 37°C). We first fused a plasma membrane targeting domain (CAAX) to the C terminus of the SunTag24x (SunTag24x-CAAX) (see Extended Experimental Procedures for details on nomenclature). SunTag24x-CAAX was coexpressed with the scFv-GCN4-GFP antibody fused to a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) to sequester unbound antibody into the nucleus (together referred to as SunTag24x-CAAX-GFP), which resulted in the appearance of bright punctae on the plasma membrane (Figure 3A). Individual fluorescent punctae could be visualized diffusing in the plane of the membrane, either by spinning disk confocal microscopy (Figure 3A and Movie S1) or by total internal fluorescence microscopy (TIRF; data not shown). The fluorescence intensity of single SunTag-CAAX foci was on average 18-fold brighter than that of single sfGFP-CAAX molecules when using identical imaging conditions (Figure 3A), largely consistent with one antibody-GFP fusion bound to each peptide in the 24× peptide array. This result also supports the conclusion that individual fluorescence foci are indeed single SunTag24x-CAAX molecules. As the SunTag foci were much brighter than single GFP, it was possible to use lower excitation laser power to detect single foci; when using 10 mW laser power when imaging SunTag24x-CAAX compared with 55 mW for sfGFP-CAAX, we observed that the signal-to-noise (single-molecule brightness compared to neighboring background) was still 5.5-fold greater, and the rate of photobleaching was more than 10-fold lower for the SunTag compared to single GFP (half-life was 6.8 s; n = 150 molecules in 5 cells for SunTag24x-CAAX versus 0.57 s; n = 60 molecules in 4 cells for sfGFP-CAAX). Thus, due to the brighter signal, SunTag24x-CAAX could be imaged at lower laser intensities than sfGFP-CAAX, and single foci could be imaged substantially longer. Single-molecule imaging in the interior of the cell is more difficult than at the plasma membrane due to lower signal to background and the inability to use TIRF microscopy. We therefore tested whether the SunTag could be used to image single molecules deep inside the cell. When the SunTag24x was expressed as a cytosolic protein (SunTag24x-GFP) or a nuclear protein by fusing it to a nuclear import sequence (NLS-SunTag24x-GFP), bright foci were observed rapidly diffusing in the cytoplasm or nucleus, respectively, using spinning disk confocal microscopy (Figure S3A and Movie S1). Thus, SunTag provides a very visible fluorescent marker for single molecules within the cell interior. Because the SunTag with 24 bound GFPs would be ∼1.4 mDa, much larger than a single GFP tag, we wished to determine the effect on diffusion. Using single-molecule tracking (see the Experimental Procedures section), we found that SunTag24x-GFP-CAAX molecules diffused more slowly in the plasma membrane than GFP-CAAX (diffusion coefficients of 1.3 ± 0.28 μm2/s; n = 924 molecules in 3 cells versus 0.12 ± 0.02 μm2/s; n = 3,767 molecules in 4 cells [mean ± SEM], respectively) (Figures S3B and S3C). Similarly, single-molecule tracking revealed a diffusion coefficient of single cytoplasmic SunTag24x-GFP foci of 0.76 ± 0.06 μm2/s (mean ± SEM; n = 1,369 tracks in 6 cells) (Figure S3D). This value is reduced compared to an average-sized protein tagged with a single GFP (∼20 μm2/s) (Baum et al., 2014Baum M. Erdel F. Wachsmuth M. Rippe K. Retrieving the intracellular topology from multi-scale protein mobility mapping in living cells.Nature Commun. 2014; 5: 4494Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) but well within the expected range of a multimer of 24 GFP molecules (Baum et al., 2014Baum M. Erdel F. Wachsmuth M. Rippe K. Retrieving the intracellular topology from multi-scale protein mobility mapping in living cells.Nature Commun. 2014; 5: 4494Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Together, these results show, as expected, that the relatively large SunTag reduces protein diffusion compared to a single GFP. We next imaged SunTag in other intracellular compartments. The mitoNEET mitochondrial targeting domain fused to the SunTag24x was expressed in U2OS cells together with scFv-GCN4-GFP and imaged using spinning disk confocal microscopy. Bright punctae could be observed very rapid diffusing in the mitochondrial membrane (Movie S1). We also examined a histone H2B-SunTag24x-GFP fusion and found that punctae exhibited slow, highly confined diffusion in the nucleus (D = 2.1 ± 0.6 × 103 nm2/s) (Figures S3E and S3F and Movie S2), which is consistent with an interaction with DNA. Together, these results show that the SunTag24x can be targeted to different regions of the cell and used as a single-molecule fluorescent reporter. We next tested whether the SunTag could be used to make single-molecule measurements of cytoskeletal motors moving in vivo. Previous studies have imaged single motor proteins fused to three copies of GFP using TIRF microscopy (Cai et al., 2009Cai D. McEwen D.P. Martens J.R. Meyhofer E. Verhey K.J. Single molecule imaging reveals differences in microtubule track selection between Kinesin motors.PLoS Biol. 2009; 7: e1000216Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), but the signal is relatively weak, and imaging by TIRF microscopy is limited to molecules that are very close to the glass surface (<200 nm). We first fused SunTag24x to a truncated version of kinesin-1 (termed K560), which is a processive motor that lacks its cargo binding domain. Spinning-disk confocal imaging (10 frames/s) of K560-SunTag24x-GFP revealed bright foci moving unidirectionally throughout the cell with an average speed of 1.29 ± 0.24 μm/s (Figures 3B and S3G and Movie S3). Due to the very low photobleaching, we were able to measure run lengths of single K560-SunTag24x-GFP molecules, revealing an average run length of 1.28 ± 0.63 μm (Figure S3H), which is consistent with previous measurements (0.91 μm) (Cai et al., 2009Cai D. McEwen D.P. Martens J.R. Meyhofer E. Verhey K.J. Single molecule imaging reveals differences in microtubule track selection between Kinesin motors.PLoS Biol. 2009; 7: e1000216Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). These results show that the SunTag allows long-term single-molecule imaging of functional cytoskeletal motor proteins in vivo. Interestingly, when we imaged motility of K560-SunTag24x-GFP (which moves exclusively toward plus ends of microtubules), we found that a substantial fraction of K560-SunTag24x-GFP motors moved toward the cell interior, indicating that the microtubule tracks for these motors have their plus ends directed inward (Figures 3C and 3D). This was surprising, as microtubules are generally thought to be oriented with their plus ends outward. Indeed, in these same cells, when microtubule polarity was assessed using a conventional method of visualizing EB3-tdTomato, a protein that selectively marks the growing plus ends of microtubule (Akhmanova and Steinmetz, 2008Akhmanova A. Steinmetz M.O. Tracking the ends: a dynamic protein network controls the fate of microtubule tips.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 309-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar), then microtubule plus ends were found to be oriented almost exclusively toward the cell periphery (Figures 3C and 3D). By fusing the microtubule minus-end binding protein Camsap2 to SunTag, we indeed could confirm that a subset of microtubules had their minus ends near the cell periphery in these cells (Figure S3I and Movie S4). Thus, live-cell imaging using K560-SunTag24x-GFP as a reporter for microtubule polarity suggests that cells contain a subpopulation of microtubules that are not growing (and hence not interacting with EB3) and have inverted polarity with respect to the cell periphery. We next sought to test whether the SunTag could be used to study cytoskeletal motors whose motility has not been characterized. Kif18b is a member of the kinesin superfamily, which has been shown to track with growing microtubule plus ends and regulate their dynamics (Stout et al., 2011Stout J.R. Yount A.L. Powers J.A. Leblanc C. Ems-McClung S.C. Walczak C.E. Kif18B interacts with EB1 and controls astral microtubule length during mitosis.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2011; 22: 3070-3080Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, Tanenbaum et al., 2011Tanenbaum M.E. Macurek L. van der Vaart B. Galli M. Akhmanova A. Medema R.H.

Bio. 2011; 21: 1356-1365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). However, it is currently unclear whether individual Kif18b molecules track the growing plus ends by rapidly binding and releasing the plus end, as is the case for other plus-end tracking proteins (Akhmanova and Steinmetz, 2008Akhmanova A. Steinmetz M.O. Tracking the ends: a dynamic protein network controls the fate of microtubule tips.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 309-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar) or whether it walks along the microtubule, remaining at the tip as it elongates. Although Kif18b motility has not been directly measured, homologs of Kif18b were found to move at rates in vitro that are far too slow to keep up with microtubule growth (<100 nm/s), arguing against the latter model. To analyze Kif18b’s motility in vivo, we expressed full-length Kif18b with a C-terminal SunTag24x in U2OS cells. Surprisingly, and unlike what was reported for its homologs, single KIF18b-SunTag24x-GFP molecules translocated along microtubules at high speeds (635 ± 163 nm/s; mean ± SD) (Figures 3E and 3F and Movie S5), which is substantially faster than the speed of microtubule growth in these cells (Tanenbaum et al., 2006Tanenbaum M.E. Galjart N. van Vugt M.A. Medema R.H. CLIP-170 facilitates the formation of kinetochore-microtubule attachments.EMBO J. 2006; 25: 45-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). These results reveal that the SunTag can be used to determine the physical properties of molecular motors in vivo. We also tested whether the SunTag could be used to image single cytoskeletal filament dynamics in dense networks using a novel type of fluorescence speckle microscopy (FSM). Traditional FSM visualizes and tracks identifiable fluorescent “speckles” that arise from the stochastic variations in the incorporation of fluorescently labeled actin or tubulin monomers into complex cytoskeletal networks (Waterman-Storer et al., 1998Waterman-Storer C.M. Desai A. Bulinski J.C. Salmon E.D. Fluorescent speckle microscopy, a method to visualize the dynamics of protein assemblies in living cells.Curr. Bio. 1998; 8: 1227-1230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, due to the stochastic number of fluorophores contained within a diffraction-limited spot in traditional FSM, the brightness of fluorescent speckles varies considerably. Furthermore because multiple fluorophores give rise to an individual speckle, a speckle can contain fluorescently labeled monomers that are present in different filaments, which is problematic for following single filament dynamics. Therefore, we examined whether single SunTag molecules could be used to create positional marks to follow the movements of individual microtubules in living cells. For this purpose, we fused SunTag24x to an ATP hydrolysis defective K560 mutant that forms a tight, rigor bond with microtubules but does not translocate along them (termed K560rig). When K560rig-SunTag24x-GFP was expressed in cells at low levels, individual GFP foci colocalized with microtubules (visualized by α-tubulin-mCherry), thus providing a sparse labeling pattern of the microtubule network (Figures 3G and 3H and Movie S6). Although the microtubule network appeared largely static when the microtubules were imaged directly with mCherry-tubulin (Movie S6), imaging of K560rig-SunTag24x-GFP revealed many microtubules undergoing translocation events in cells (Figure 3H and Movie S6). Microtubule translocation occurred with an average speed of 1.1 ± 0.3 μm/s (mean ± SD; n = 21 events in 4 cells), a rate suggesting that they were propelled by microtubule-based motor proteins. The frequency of microtubule translocation was 0.17 min−1 per cell, and these movements had a duration of 1.9 ± 0.7 s (mean ± SD, n = 21 events in 4 cells). Angular movements of the microtubule axis also could be observed in cases in which a single microtubule had two or more K560rig-SunTag24x-GFP molecules bound as fiducial markers (Figure 3H and Movie S6). These results reveal that the SunTag provides a powerful tool to study movements of individual microtubule filaments in dense microtubule networks in living cells. The first generation construct of SunTag24x (termed v1) described in the previous sections was expressed at extremely low levels,"
https://openalex.org/W2126231259,"Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia, characterized by two pathological hallmarks: amyloid-β plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. The amyloid hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease posits that the excessive accumulation of amyloid-β peptide leads to neurofibrillary tangles composed of aggregated hyperphosphorylated tau. However, to date, no single disease model has serially linked these two pathological events using human neuronal cells. Mouse models with familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) mutations exhibit amyloid-β-induced synaptic and memory deficits but they do not fully recapitulate other key pathological events of Alzheimer's disease, including distinct neurofibrillary tangle pathology. Human neurons derived from Alzheimer's disease patients have shown elevated levels of toxic amyloid-β species and phosphorylated tau but did not demonstrate amyloid-β plaques or neurofibrillary tangles. Here we report that FAD mutations in β-amyloid precursor protein and presenilin 1 are able to induce robust extracellular deposition of amyloid-β, including amyloid-β plaques, in a human neural stem-cell-derived three-dimensional (3D) culture system. More importantly, the 3D-differentiated neuronal cells expressing FAD mutations exhibited high levels of detergent-resistant, silver-positive aggregates of phosphorylated tau in the soma and neurites, as well as filamentous tau, as detected by immunoelectron microscopy. Inhibition of amyloid-β generation with β- or γ-secretase inhibitors not only decreased amyloid-β pathology, but also attenuated tauopathy. We also found that glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) regulated amyloid-β-mediated tau phosphorylation. We have successfully recapitulated amyloid-β and tau pathology in a single 3D human neural cell culture system. Our unique strategy for recapitulating Alzheimer's disease pathology in a 3D neural cell culture model should also serve to facilitate the development of more precise human neural cell models of other neurodegenerative disorders."

We apply a bioinspired, omniphobic coating to tubing and catheters and show that it completely repels blood and suppresses biofilm formation. The coating is a covalently tethered, flexible molecular layer of perfluorocarbon, which holds a thin liquid film of medical-grade perfluorocarbon on the surface. This coating prevents fibrin attachment, reduces platelet adhesion and activation, suppresses biofilm formation and is stable under blood flow in vitro. Surface-coated medical-grade tubing and catheters, assembled into arteriovenous shunts and implanted in pigs, remain patent for at least 8 h without anticoagulation. This surface-coating technology could reduce the use of anticoagulants in patients and help to prevent thrombotic occlusion and biofouling of medical devices."

Xianqin Zhang et al. show that intracellular ISG15, an interferon-stimulated ubiquitin-like molecule, functions as negative regulator of type I interferon. ISG15 deficiency in humans leads to a failure to maintain adequate levels of USP18, triggering an increase in type I interferon production and signalling, and promoting auto-inflammatory disease. This work suggests that the primary role for ISG15 in humans is not antiviral — a possibility much studied in the past — but is to prevent IFN-α/β-dependent auto-inflammation. Intracellular ISG15 is an interferon (IFN)-α/β-inducible ubiquitin-like modifier which can covalently bind other proteins in a process called ISGylation; it is an effector of IFN-α/β-dependent antiviral immunity in mice1,2,3,4. We previously published a study describing humans with inherited ISG15 deficiency but without unusually severe viral diseases5. We showed that these patients were prone to mycobacterial disease and that human ISG15 was non-redundant as an extracellular IFN-γ-inducing molecule. We show here that ISG15-deficient patients also display unanticipated cellular, immunological and clinical signs of enhanced IFN-α/β immunity, reminiscent of the Mendelian autoinflammatory interferonopathies Aicardi–Goutières syndrome and spondyloenchondrodysplasia6,7,8,9. We further show that an absence of intracellular ISG15 in the patients’ cells prevents the accumulation of USP1810,11, a potent negative regulator of IFN-α/β signalling, resulting in the enhancement and amplification of IFN-α/β responses. Human ISG15, therefore, is not only redundant for antiviral immunity, but is a key negative regulator of IFN-α/β immunity. In humans, intracellular ISG15 is IFN-α/β-inducible not to serve as a substrate for ISGylation-dependent antiviral immunity, but to ensure USP18-dependent regulation of IFN-α/β and prevention of IFN-α/β-dependent autoinflammation."

Importantly, hippocampal inactivation did not alter the total amount of activity in most brain regions. Instead, it selectively prevented neurons that were active during learning from being reactivated during retrieval. These data provide functional evidence that the hippocampus reactivates specific memory representations during retrieval. Since patient H.M., researchers have known that the hippocampus is essential for memory (Scoville and Milner, 1957Scoville W.B. Milner B. Loss of recent memory after bilateral hippocampal lesions.J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatry. 1957; 20: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4869) Google Scholar). This discovery was confirmed by animal studies showing that dysfunction in this area produces profound amnesia for spatial and contextual information (Kim and Fanselow, 1992Kim J.J. Fanselow M.S. Modality-specific retrograde amnesia of fear.Science. 1992; 256: 675-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (1965) Google Scholar, Morris et al., 1986Morris R.G. Anderson E. Lynch G.S. Baudry M.

Despite these facts, it is still unknown why the hippocampus is so fundamental for memory. The dominant idea, based on the work of Marr, is that memory is retrieved when the hippocampus reinstates patterns of cortical activity that were observed during learning (Alvarez and Squire, 1994Alvarez P. Squire L.R. Memory consolidation and the medial temporal lobe: a simple network model.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1994; 91: 7041-7045Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar, Marr, 1971Marr D.

Computational analysis of the role of the hippocampus in memory.Hippocampus. 1994; 4: 374-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). This idea is supported by spatial studies in rodents showing that learned sequences are replayed in the hippocampus and cortex after training (Ji and Wilson, 2007Ji D. Wilson M.A. Coordinated memory replay in the visual cortex and hippocampus during sleep.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 100-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar). Similar effects have been observed in human patients during free recall of episodic memories (Gelbard-Sagiv et al., 2008Gelbard-Sagiv H. Mukamel R. Harel M. Malach R. Fried I. Internally generated reactivation of single neurons in human hippocampus during free recall.Science. 2008; 322: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). However, it has yet to be determined whether cortical representations formed during learning are reinstated by the hippocampus during retrieval. Recent studies have used fos-tTA reporter mice to tag active neurons in the hippocampus, cortex, and amygdala during context fear learning and show that they are reactivated several days later when memory is retrieved (Liu et al., 2012Liu X. Ramirez S. Pang P.T. Puryear C.B. Govindarajan A. Deisseroth K. Tonegawa S.

Similar to recording experiments, these data indicate that specific context representations are reactivated after learning. However, studies to date have not determined whether the hippocampus is responsible for reinstating memory representations in other structures as is widely assumed (Frankland and Bontempi, 2005Frankland P.W. Bontempi B. The organization of recent and remote memories.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar). To examine this idea, we used fos-tTA mice to tag active CA1 neurons with the long-lasting fluorescent protein H2B-GFP and the light-activated proton pump archaerhodopsin (ArchT). These proteins allowed us to identify encoding neurons several days after learning and inactivate them with laser stimulation. When tagged CA1 neurons were silenced, we found that memory retrieval was impaired and representations in the cortex (entorhinal, retrosplenial, and perirhinal) and amygdala (central nucleus) could not be reactivated. These results provide direct evidence that the hippocampus is fundamental for memory because it reinstates patterns of activity that were originally present during learning. To identify and label active neurons, we used fos-tTA reporter mice that express the long-lasting fluorescent protein H2B-GFP. We previously found that ≈40% of tagged neurons in the CA1 region of the hippocampus are reactivated when context fear memories are retrieved (Tayler et al., 2013Tayler K.K. Tanaka K.Z. Reijmers L.G. Wiltgen B.J. Reactivation of neural ensembles during the retrieval of recent and remote memory.Curr. Biol. 2013; 23: 99-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). To selectively silence these cells, we engineered our reporter mice to express Cre recombinase under the control of the tetO promoter. In the absence of doxycycline (DOX), c-Fos activity leads to the expression of tTA, H2B-GFP, and Cre in these animals (Figure 1A). Previous studies showed that activity-dependent labeling in fos-tTA reporter mice largely recapitulates the expression of endogenous c-Fos in the hippocampus (Liu et al., 2012Liu X. Ramirez S. Pang P.T. Puryear C.B. Govindarajan A. Deisseroth K. Tonegawa S. Optogenetic stimulation of a hippocampal engram activates fear memory recall.Nature. 2012; 484: 381-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). To silence CA1 neurons that were active during learning, we infused an adeno-associated virus (AAV) that encodes a double-floxed inverted ArchT gene into the dorsal hippocampus (AAV-FLEX-ArchT) (Figure 1B). Once expressed, ArchT can be activated with green light to produce robust silencing of neural activity (Han et al., 2011Han X. Chow B.Y. Zhou H. Klapoetke N.C. Chuong A. Rajimehr R. Yang A. Baratta M.V. Winkle J. Desimone R. Boyden E.S. A high-light sensitivity optical neural silencer: development and application to optogenetic control of non-human primate cortex.Front Syst Neurosci. 2011; 5: 18Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). In our mice, Cre is expressed in active neurons and causes the ArchT gene to be inverted and expressed under the control of the constitutively active CAG promoter. Figure 1B (top left) shows the expression of ArchT in the dorsal hippocampus of fos-tTA/tetO-Cre mice that underwent context fear conditioning off DOX. Expression was restricted to CA1 dendrites and axons and was not observed in cell bodies. We estimated that ArchT was expressed in ≈1.05 mm3 of tissue in the dorsal hippocampus (Figure S1 available online). Expression was not observed in the ventral hippocampus (bottom left). We also did not observe ArchT expression in mice that were fear conditioned on DOX (top right). Given that ArchT was selectively expressed in CA1 dendrites and axons, we used H2B-GFP to determine which cells were active during learning. Figure 1B (bottom right) shows the expression of H2B-GFP in cell nuclei and ArchT in fibers of fos-tTA/tetO-Cre/tetO-H2B-GFP mice that were trained off DOX. Consistent with previous work, expression was observed almost exclusively in excitatory cells (Figure S2) (Liu et al., 2012Liu X. Ramirez S. Pang P.T. Puryear C.B. Govindarajan A. Deisseroth K. Tonegawa S. Optogenetic stimulation of a hippocampal engram activates fear memory recall.Nature. 2012; 484: 381-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, Reijmers et al., 2007Reijmers L.G.

Given their distinct localization, we could not determine the degree to which H2B-GFP and ArchT overlapped in CA1 neurons. However, the inactivation data presented in the next section provides direct evidence that ArchT is selectively expressed in H2B-GFP-positive cells. We also examined the expression of H2B-GFP in control mice (n = 3) that had DOX removed but were not trained. Consistent with previous work, these animals had significantly fewer H2B-GFP-positive neurons in CA1 (11%) than mice in the ArchT (28%) and No ArchT Laser (23%) groups (main effect of group, F (2, 11) = 7.2, p < 0.05; planned comparisons, Fisher’s PLSD, p values < 0.05) (Tayler et al., 2013Tayler K.K. Tanaka K.Z. Reijmers L.G. Wiltgen B.J. Reactivation of neural ensembles during the retrieval of recent and remote memory.Curr. Biol. 2013; 23: 99-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). To inactivate ArchT-positive neurons during memory retrieval, we infused AAV-FLEX-ArchT into dorsal CA1 (dCA1) and implanted bilateral optic fibers in the same region. During context fear conditioning, DOX was removed to induce the selective expression of ArchT and H2B-GFP in active neurons (Figure 1C, left). After training, we administered high-concentration DOX to suppress additional expression of H2B-GFP and ArchT. A memory test was conducted 2 days later and green laser light (532 nm, 10mW) was delivered to both hippocampi to stimulate ArchT. We compared performance in the ArchT-Laser group to three control conditions. One group received laser stimulation but did not express ArchT (No ArchT-Laser). Another expressed ArchT but did not receive laser stimulation (ArchT-No Laser). The third control group did not express ArchT and did not receive laser stimulation (No ArchT-No Laser). In each of these groups, H2B-GFP-positive neurons should be intact during testing and express c-Fos when memory is retrieved (Figure 1C, right). When tagged CA1 neurons were silenced, we found that memory retrieval was significantly impaired in the ArchT-Laser group relative to controls (Figure 2A; main effect of group F (3,19) = 5.15, p < 0.05; planned comparisons, Fisher’s PLSD, p values < 0.05). Freezing levels did not differ between any of the control groups (planned comparisons, Fisher’s PLSD, p values > 0.05). These results provide functional evidence that memory retrieval requires the reactivation of previously engaged CA1 neurons. To determine the degree to which reactivation was disrupted, we quantified the expression of H2B-GFP and c-Fos 90 min after the memory test. As in our previous work, we compared the percentage of double-labeled neurons observed in dCA1 to that expected by chance alone (percent H2B-GFP × percent c-Fos) (Tayler et al., 2013Tayler K.K. Tanaka K.Z. Reijmers L.G. Wiltgen B.J. Reactivation of neural ensembles during the retrieval of recent and remote memory.Curr. Biol. 2013; 23: 99-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). We found a significant reduction in double labeling (normalized to chance) in the ArchT-Laser group compared to that observed in No ArchT-Laser mice (Figure 2B; main effect of group F (1,9) = 43.83, p < 0.05). Reactivation of dCA1 neurons exceeded chance levels in No ArchT-Laser mice (paired t test, p < 0.05) but did not in the ArchT-Laser group (paired t test, p > 0.05). These results indicate that ArchT stimulation prevented the reactivation of dCA1 neurons during memory retrieval. Laser stimulation in the No-ArchT group did not appear to disrupt reactivation as the degree of overlap was nearly identical to that seen in nonstimulated control animals (Figure S2). The amount of freezing observed during testing was strongly correlated with the degree of reactivation in the dCA1 region of No ArchT-Laser mice (Figure 2C; r = 0.88, p < 0.05). This correlation was completely eliminated in the ArchT-Laser group (r = −0.15, p > 05.). Expression levels of H2B-GFP (no effect of group, F (1,9) = 2.18, p > 0.05) and c-Fos (no effect of group, F (1,9) = 1.21, p > 0.05) in dCA1 were similar in both groups. However, as expected, c-Fos expression was selectively reduced in tagged neurons relative to untagged cells in ArchT-Laser animals (Figure 2D; group × cell type interaction, F (1,9) = 127.4, p < 0.05). This result demonstrates that ArchT was selectively expressed in H2B-GFP-tagged neurons. Interestingly, c-Fos expression in the ArchT-Laser group was decreased in tagged cells (Fisher’s PLSD, p < 0.05) and increased in untagged neurons (Fisher’s PLSD, p < 0.05) compared to No ArchT-Laser controls. This finding is consistent with the idea that active CA1 neurons can suppress the activity of neighboring cells (Hirase et al., 2001Hirase H. Leinekugel X. Czurkó A. Csicsvari J. Buzsáki G. Firing rates of hippocampal neurons are preserved during subsequent sleep episodes and modified by novel awake experience.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2001; 98: 9386-9390Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). To determine the anatomical specificity of our manipulation, we also examined reactivation in dorsal CA3 (dCA3) and ventral CA1 (vCA1). We found that ArchT stimulation in dCA1 had no effect on c-Fos expression in H2B-GFP-positive or -negative neurons in dCA3 (Figure 2E; no effect of group F (1, 9) = 1.51, p > 0.05; no group × cell type interaction F < 1) or vCA1 (Figure 2F; no effect of group F (1, 9) = 4.07, p > 0.05; no group × cell type interaction F (1, 9) = 1.5, p > 0.05). These results indicate that ArchT-mediated silencing was restricted to neurons in the dorsal segment of CA1. Our data suggest that a specific subset of dCA1 neurons mediate memory retrieval. However, an alternative possibility is that retrieval is impaired anytime hippocampal activity is disrupted (independent of which neurons are affected). To test this idea, we silenced dCA1 neurons that were either part of the trained context representation (overlapping) or orthogonal to it (distinct). If memory retrieval requires the reactivation of specific CA1 cells, then performance should only be impaired when an overlapping representation is silenced. Inactivation of a distinct context representation should have no effect. To test this idea, we trained mice in similar environments (A and A’) that activate many of the same cells in dCA1 (Figure S3). Mice were first exposed to A’ (off DOX), where active neurons were tagged with ArchT (Figure 2G). Two days later, animals were fear conditioned (on DOX) in context A. Neurons were not tagged during this session. Memory was then tested in context A while neurons from A’ were silenced via ArchT stimulation. Given the significant overlap between these representations, we predicted that memory retrieval would be impaired. In a second procedure, we prevented overlap between context representations by inactivating A’ neurons while mice were fear conditioned in A. Once again, active neurons were first tagged with ArchT in context A’. To prevent overlap, these cells were silenced during subsequent training in A (Figure 2H). Silencing A’ cells during testing in this group should not alter the representation of context A and, as a result, memory should be intact. Figure 2I shows the freezing levels during the context A memory test when ArchT-labeled neurons were silenced. As predicted, inactivating these cells impaired retrieval in mice that had overlapping context representations and had no effect on animals with distinct representations of A and A’ (Figure 2I; main effect of group F (1,12) = 9.42, p < 0.05). The amount of freezing in the Distinct memory group was comparable to that observed in the control groups shown in Figure 2A. An analysis of overlap in H2B-GFP-positive mice from each group suggests that ArchT stimulation silenced a similar number of tagged neurons in both conditions (Figure S3). Together, these data demonstrate that hippocampal inactivation impairs retrieval only when the same neurons that were active during encoding are silenced during retrieval. We next examined the assumption that the hippocampus reactivates cortical representations during memory retrieval. To do this, we quantified the expression of H2B-GFP and c-Fos in regions that receive monosynaptic projections from dCA1: subiculum (SUB), lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC), perirhinal cortex (PER), and retrosplenial cortex (RSC) (Cenquizca and Swanson, 2007Cenquizca L.A. Swanson L.W. Spatial organization of direct hippocampal field CA1 axonal projections to the rest of the cerebral cortex.Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 2007; 56: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). We observed a large number of ArchT-labeled fibers in each of these regions (Figures 3A, 3D, and 3G ). We used these fibers to trace the axons of tagged CA1 cells and examine activity in directly connected cortical regions. When dCA1 neurons were silenced, we found that the total amount of c-Fos expression in the SUB and RSC were unaltered (Figures 3B and 3E; no effect of group, SUB F < 1; RSC F < 1). However, there was a significant reduction in c-Fos expression in tagged neurons (Fisher’s PLSD, p < 0.05) compared to untagged cells (Fisher’s PLSD, p > 0.05) in the ArchT-Laser group (Figures 3C and 3F; significant group × cell type interaction, SUB F (1, 9) = 44.73, p < 0.05; significant group × cell type interaction RSC F (1, 9) = 4.63, p = 0.05). In LEC/PER, there was a slight reduction in the total amount of c-Fos expression (Figure 3H; main effect of group, F (1,9) = 6.54, p < 0.05) that was observed in both tagged (Fisher’s PLSD, p < 0.05) and untagged (Fisher’s PLSD, p < 0.05) cells (Figure 3I). However, similar to the results in SUB and RSC, the size of this reduction was significantly larger in tagged neurons compared to untagged cells (significant group × cell type interaction, F (1, 9) = 16.83, p < 0.05). Together, these data demonstrate that the hippocampus is fundamental for memory because it can reinstate patterns of cortical activity that were originally observed during learning. In our final analyses, we examined activity in two regions of the amygdala that are known to be essential for context fear; the central nucleus (CeA) and the basolateral nucleus (BLA) (Figure 4A) (Maren, 2001Maren S. Neurobiology of Pavlovian fear conditioning.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 897-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar). The CeA receives dense inputs from SUB, LEC, and PER and light inputs from vCA1 (Pitkänen et al., 2000Pitkänen A. Pikkarainen M. Nurminen N. Ylinen A. Reciprocal connections between the amygdala and the hippocampal formation, perirhinal cortex, and postrhinal cortex in rat. A review.Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 2000; 911: 369-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). We found that ArchT stimulation in dCA1 did not affect the total amount of c-Fos expression in this region (Figure 4B; no effect of group, F (1,9) = 3.05, p > 0.05). However, c-Fos expression in tagged neurons was significantly reduced (Fisher’s PLSD, p < 0.05) compared to that observed in untagged cells (Fisher’s PLSD, p > 0.05) (significant group × cell type interaction, F (1, 9) = 17.86, p < 0.05) (Figure 4C). These data suggest that dCA1 modulates activity in the CeA via its projections to the SUB, LEC, and/or PER. In contrast to the CeA, the BLA exhibited no change in overall levels of c-Fos (Figure 3E, top; no effect of group, F (1,8) = 0.34, p > 0.05) or c-Fos expression in tagged (Figure 3E, bottom; Fisher’s PLSD, p > 0.05) and untagged neurons (Fisher’s PLSD, p > 0.05) (no group × cell type interaction, F (1, 9) = 1.4, p > 0.05; no effect of group, F < 1) when dCA1 was silenced. This result is consistent with the fact that the BLA receives dense projections from vCA1, which exhibited normal reactivation in our experiments (Pitkänen et al., 2000Pitkänen A. Pikkarainen M. Nurminen N. Ylinen A. Reciprocal connections between the amygdala and the hippocampal formation, perirhinal cortex, and postrhinal cortex in rat. A review.Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 2000; 911: 369-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). Together, these data suggest that dorsal and ventral CA1 can independently modulate the retrieval of context fear memories in the amygdala, a finding that is not predicted by traditional models (Wiltgen and Fanselow, 2003Wiltgen B.J. Fanselow M.J. A model of hippocampal-cortical-amygdala interactions based on contextual fear conditioning.in: Jeffery K. The Neurobiology of Spatial Behaviour. Oxford University Press, New York2003: 83-103Crossref Google Scholar). The hippocampus is essential for retrieving spatial and contextual memories (Kim and Fanselow, 1992Kim J.J. Fanselow M.S. Modality-specific retrograde amnesia of fear.Science. 1992; 256: 675-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (1965) Google Scholar, Moser and Moser, 1998Moser M.B. Moser E.I. Distributed encoding and retrieval of spatial memory in the hippocampus.J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7535-7542PubMed Google Scholar). It is thought to mediate this process by activating unique representations of the environment that were formed during learning. To test this idea, we combined fos-tTA/tetO-Cre mice with hippocampal infusions of AAV to induce ArchT expression in an activity-dependent manner. This allowed us to selectively silence CA1 neurons that were sufficiently active to drive the c-fos promoter. When these cells were inactivated with laser stimulation, mice were unable to retrieve a previously formed context fear memory. Silencing CA1 neurons that were not active during learning had no effect on retrieval. These results are consistent with the idea that specific ensembles of CA1 neurons are used to encode context memories (Guzowski et al., 1999Guzowski J.F. McNaughton B.L. Barnes C.A. Worley P.F. Environment-specific expression of the immediate-early gene Arc in hippocampal neuronal ensembles.Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 1120-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). The expression of immediate-early genes (IEGs) requires high-frequency activity that is sufficient to activate NMDARs (Steward and Worley, 2001Steward O. Worley P.F.

The Hippocampus as a Cognitive Map. Oxford University Press, Oxford1978Google Scholar). Consistent with this idea, the number of neurons expressing IEGs after spatial exploration is similar to the number of place cells that are found in recording studies (Guzowski et al., 1999Guzowski J.F.

Neurosci. 1999; 2: 1120-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar, Leutgeb et al., 2004Leutgeb S. Leutgeb J.K. Treves A. Moser M.B. Moser E.I. Distinct ensemble codes in hippocampal areas CA3 and CA1.Science. 2004; 305: 1295-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). In addition, manipulations that alter the activity of place cells produce similar effects on IEG-labeled (e.g., Arc) neurons (Vazdarjanova and Guzowski, 2004Vazdarjanova A. Guzowski J.F. Differences in hippocampal neuronal population responses to modifications of an environmental context: evidence for distinct, yet complementary, functions of CA3 and CA1 ensembles.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 6489-6496Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Given that gene expression in fos-tTA mice largely recapitulates endogenous c-Fos expression (Liu et al., 2012Liu X. Ramirez S. Pang P.T. Puryear C.B. Govindarajan A. Deisseroth K. Tonegawa S. Optogenetic stimulation of a hippocampal engram activates fear memory recall.Nature. 2012; 484: 381-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), it is likely that place cell activity played a major role in the induction of H2B-GFP, Cre, and ArchT in our experiments. The current study also examined the idea that the hippocampus retrieves memory by reinstating patterns of cortical activity that were observed during learning. This assumption has been central to theories of hippocampal function for decades (Frankland and Bontempi, 2005Frankland P.W. Bontempi B. The organization of recent and remote memories.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar). Previous work showed that hippocampal and cortical neurons are reactivated after learning during memory retrieval and sleep (Ji and Wilson, 2007Ji D. Wilson M.A. Coordinated memory replay in the visual cortex and hippocampus during sleep.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 100-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar, Tayler et al., 2013Tayler K.K. Tanaka K.Z. Reijmers L.G. Wiltgen B.J. Reactivation of neural ensembles during the retrieval of recent and remote memory.Curr. Biol. 2013; 23: 99-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). However, these studies did not determine whether the hippocampus is required to induce reactivation in the cortex as is assumed by current models. To test this idea, we traced ArchT-labeled fibers from tagged dCA1 neurons to their targets in SUB, LEC, PER, and RSC. When CA1 neurons were silenced during retrieval, reactivation was disrupted in these regions (Figure 4F). Importantly, the disruption was selective; activity was normal in cortical neurons that were not engaged during learning (i.e., H2B-GFP-negative cells). Therefore, when dCA1 is prevented from retrieving a specific context memory, representations in connected cortical regions also cannot be reactivated. This finding implies that extrahippocampal inputs to these cortical areas cannot fully activate representations that were established during learning. The fact that reactivation was reduced in the cortex while overall activity was maintained suggests that new cortical neurons came online during the retrieval test. We observed a similar effect in CA1 (Figures 2 and S3). These data suggest that memory retrieval depends on the reactivation of specific cells in the hippocampus and cortex. Our previous work (showing reactivation in the training context but not a distinct environment) is consistent with this finding (Tayler et al., 2013Tayler K.K. Tanaka K.Z. Reijmers L.G. Wiltgen B.J. Reactivation of neural ensembles during the retrieval of recent and remote memory.Curr. Biol. 2013; 23: 99-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Increased activity in new cortical cells may have been difficult to detect in our experiments because the number of H2B-GFP-negative neurons is quite large compared to that observed in CA1 (90%–95% in cortex versus 75%–80% in CA1) (Tayler et al., 2013Tayler K.K. Tanaka K.Z. Reijmers L.G. Wiltgen B.J. Reactivation of neural ensembles during the retrieval of recent and remote memory.Curr. Biol. 2013; 23: 99-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). As a result, a large number of H2B-GFP-negative cells in the cortex would need to express c-Fos to significantly increase activity in this population. In the current experiments, reactivation was only analyzed in cortical regions that contained ArchT-labeled fibers. These areas were quantified because they received direct projections from the tagged CA1 neurons that were silenced during retrieval. However, models of hippocampal function predict widespread disruption in the cortex when the hippocampus is compromised (Frankland and Bontempi, 2005Frankland P.W. Bontempi B. The organization of recent and remote memories.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar). This assumption was difficult to assess because indirectly connected cortical regions did not contain ArchT-labeled fibers. Given that only a portion of CA1 was silenced (Figure S1), nonlabeled regions probably contain areas that lost input from the hippocampus as well as areas that retained it. Therefore, in the absence of ArchT-labeled fibers, it is difficult to know where reactivation should be examined. Despite this fact, we did observe activity changes in amygdala nuclei that are indirectly connected to dCA1. We believe that this was the case because the CeA and BLA are relatively small and their role in context fear conditioning has been thoroughly described (Goosens and Maren, 2001Goosens K.A. Maren S. Contextual and auditory fear conditioning are mediated by the lateral, basal, and central amygdaloid nuclei in rats.Learn. Mem. 2001; 8: 148-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Current models of fear conditioning assume that contextual information is relayed from the ventral hippocampus to the BLA, where it can be associated with aversive events (Maren and Fanselow, 1995Maren S. Fanselow M.S. Synaptic plasticity in the basolateral amygdala induced by hippocampal formation stimulation in vivo.J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 7548-7564PubMed Google Scholar). The CeA is typically viewed as an output structure that receives input from the BLA and induces fear responding via its projections to the midbrain (LeDoux, 2000LeDoux J.E. Emotion circuits in the brain.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 23: 155-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (6169) Google Scholar) (but see Balleine and Killcross, 2006Balleine B.W. Killcross S. Parallel incentive processing: an integrated view of amygdala function.Trends Neurosci. 2006; 29: 272-279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). However, the CeA also receives dense projections from the SUB, LEC, and PER that could influence fear responding (Pitkänen et al., 2000Pitkänen A. Pikkarainen M. Nurminen N. Ylinen A. Reciprocal connections between the amygdala and the hippocampal formation, perirhinal cortex, and postrhinal cortex in rat. A review.Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 2000; 911: 369-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). Consistent with this idea, we found that silencing dCA1 neurons disrupted reactivation in each these cortical regions and in the CeA (Figure 4F). Activity in vCA1 and the BLA were not affected. In contrast to traditional models, these data suggest that the dorsal hippocampus can modulate fear responding independent of the ventral hippocampus. To summarize, three main discoveries were made in the current study. First, we found that a subset of dCA1 neurons (those that were engaged during learning) must be reactivated for context fear memories to be retrieved. This result provides functional evidence that specific CA1 ensembles are used to encode context memories. Second, we showed that silencing previously active CA1 neurons prevents reactivation in cortical regions that are known to be important for context memory. This result provides direct evidence that the hippocampus is fundamental for memory because it can reinstate patterns of cortical activity that were observed during learning. Third, we found that silencing dCA1 neurons did not affect activity in the ventral hippocampus or BLA but, instead, disrupted reactivation in CeA. This result suggests that the dorsal hippocampus can modulate fear responding independent of the ventral hippocampus. Together, these data illustrate the utility of new genetic tools that can be used to answer fundamental questions about the hippocampus and memory, some of which have remained intractable for decades. Triple transgenic fos-tTA/tetO-H2B-GFP/tetO-Cre (TetTag-Cre) mice were generated by crossing heterozygous double transgenic mice expressing H2B-GFP under control of the tetO promoter (tetO-H2B-GFP) and a tetracycline-transactivator (tTA) protein under control of the c-fos promoter (fos-tTA) (Tayler et al., 2013Tayler K.K.

Biol. 2013; 23: 99-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) with heterozygous transgenic mice expressing Cre recombinase under control of the tetO promoter (tetO-Cre, JAX 006234). TetTag-Cre animals were maintained in a C57BL/6J background. B6/129 F1 hybrids were generated by breeding TetTag-Cre animals with 129S6 mice (Taconic). All of the mice used in the current experiments were F1 hybrids. All experiments were approved by the UC Davis, Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). At 8–12 weeks of age, mice received stereotaxic infusions of AAV and optic fiber implantation. Briefly, AAV2/5-CAG-FLEX-ArchT-GFP was microinjected bilaterally into the CA1 region of the dorsal hippocampus (anterioposterior [AP] −2.0 mm from bregma, mediolateral [ML] ± 1.5 mm, dorsoventral [DV] 1.5 mm). Optic fibers were constructed as previously described (Sparta et al., 2012Sparta D.R. Stamatakis A.M. Phillips J.L. Hovelsø N. van Zessen R. Stuber G.D. Construction of implantable optical fibers for long-term optogenetic manipulation of neural circuits.Nat. Protoc. 2012; 7: 12-23Crossref Scopus (273) Google Scholar) and implanted into the same stereotaxic coordinates. TetTag-Cre mice were born and raised on low-concentration DOX chow (40 mg/kg, Harlan Laboratories). To label active neurons with H2B-GFP and ArchT, we removed DOX 3 days prior to fear conditioning in context A or exposure to context A’. After the conditioning/exposure session, mice were immediately given high-concentration DOX chow (1 g/kg, Harlan Laboratories) to suppress further H2B-GFP and Cre expression. Memory was assessed 2 days after conditioning by returning the mice to the training context for 30 min and measuring the freezing response. The automated Video Freeze System (Med Associates) was used to quantify freezing as previously described (Anagnostaras et al., 2010Anagnostaras S.G. Wood S.C. Shuman T. Cai D.J. Leduc A.D. Zurn K.R.

Automated assessment of pavlovian conditioned freezing and shock reactivity in mice using the video freeze system.Front Behav Neurosci. 2010; 4: 158Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Animals in the Laser groups received stimulation (532 nm, 10 mW) that was directed at dorsal CA1. See Supplemental Information for detailed procedures. Group differences were analyzed with one-way ANOVAs or repeated-measure factorial ANOVAs followed by planned comparisons (Fisher’s PLSD). The percentage of double-labeled neurons ([H2B-GFP and c-Fos]/DAPI) was compared to that expected by chance ([H2B-GFP/DAPI] × [c-Fos/DAPI]) using paired t tests.

The disability, mortality and costs caused by osteoporosis-induced nonvertebral fractures are enormous. We demonstrate here that Wnt16-deficient mice develop spontaneous fractures as a result of low cortical thickness and high cortical porosity. In contrast, trabecular bone volume is not altered in these mice. Mechanistic studies revealed that WNT16 is osteoblast derived and inhibits human and mouse osteoclastogenesis both directly by acting on osteoclast progenitors and indirectly by increasing expression of osteoprotegerin (Opg) in osteoblasts. The signaling pathway activated by WNT16 in osteoclast progenitors is noncanonical, whereas the pathway activated in osteoblasts is both canonical and noncanonical. Conditional Wnt16 inactivation revealed that osteoblast-lineage cells are the principal source of WNT16, and its targeted deletion in osteoblasts increases fracture susceptibility. Thus, osteoblast-derived WNT16 is a previously unreported key regulator of osteoclastogenesis and fracture susceptibility. These findings open new avenues for the specific prevention or treatment of nonvertebral fractures, a substantial unmet medical need."
https://openalex.org/W2104742248,"Declarative memories are thought to be stored within anatomically distributed neuronal networks requiring the hippocampus; however, it is unclear how neocortical areas participate in memory at the time of encoding. Here, we use a c-fos-based genetic tagging system to selectively express the channelrhodopsin variant, ChEF, and optogenetically reactivate a specific neural ensemble in retrosplenial cortex (RSC) engaged by context fear conditioning. Artificial stimulation of RSC was sufficient to produce both context-specific behavior and downstream cellular activity commensurate with natural experience. Moreover, optogenetically but not contextually elicited responses were insensitive to hippocampal inactivation, suggesting that although the hippocampus is needed to coordinate activation by sensory cues, a higher-order cortical framework can independently subserve learned behavior, even shortly after learning."
https://openalex.org/W2099357999,"Genome-wide chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) is used to investigate three-dimensional genome organization in Schizosaccharomyces pombe; small domains of chromatin interact locally on chromosome arms to form globules, which depend on cohesin but not heterochromatin for formation, and heterochromatin at centromeres and telomeres provides crucial structural constraints to shape genome architecture. Mammalian and Drosophila genomes are organized into megabase-sized topological associated domains (TADs), the borders of which are enriched in cohesin and CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF). Here, Shiv Grewal and colleagues have performed Hi-C analysis to investigate three-dimensional genome organization in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, which has conserved features and mechanisms present in higher eukaryotes. The authors describe TAD-like structures in yeast for the first time. They also find smaller domains of local chromatin interactions on chromosome arms which they term 'globules'. The formation of globules requires cohesin but not heterochromatin, whereas heterochromatin seems to have a complementary role in distinct aspects of genome architecture such as at centromeres and telomeres. Eukaryotic genomes are folded into three-dimensional structures, such as self-associating topological domains, the borders of which are enriched in cohesin and CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) required for long-range interactions1,2,3,4,5,6,7. How local chromatin interactions govern higher-order folding of chromatin fibres and the function of cohesin in this process remain poorly understood. Here we perform genome-wide chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) analysis8 to explore the high-resolution organization of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe genome, which despite its small size exhibits fundamental features found in other eukaryotes9. Our analyses of wild-type and mutant strains reveal key elements of chromosome architecture and genome organization. On chromosome arms, small regions of chromatin locally interact to form ‘globules’. This feature requires a function of cohesin distinct from its role in sister chromatid cohesion. Cohesin is enriched at globule boundaries and its loss causes disruption of local globule structures and global chromosome territories. By contrast, heterochromatin, which loads cohesin at specific sites including pericentromeric and subtelomeric domains9,10,11, is dispensable for globule formation but nevertheless affects genome organization. We show that heterochromatin mediates chromatin fibre compaction at centromeres and promotes prominent inter-arm interactions within centromere-proximal regions, providing structural constraints crucial for proper genome organization. Loss of heterochromatin relaxes constraints on chromosomes, causing an increase in intra- and inter-chromosomal interactions. Together, our analyses uncover fundamental genome folding principles that drive higher-order chromosome organization crucial for coordinating nuclear functions."

The ability to differentiate human pluripotent stem cells into endothelial cells with properties of cord-blood endothelial colony–forming cells (CB-ECFCs) may enable the derivation of clinically relevant numbers of highly proliferative blood vessel–forming cells to restore endothelial function in patients with vascular disease. We describe a protocol to convert human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) or embryonic stem cells (hESCs) into cells similar to CB-ECFCs at an efficiency of >108 ECFCs produced from each starting pluripotent stem cell. The CB-ECFC-like cells display a stable endothelial phenotype with high clonal proliferative potential and the capacity to form human vessels in mice and to repair the ischemic mouse retina and limb, and they lack teratoma formation potential. We identify Neuropilin-1 (NRP-1)-mediated activation of KDR signaling through VEGF165 as a critical mechanism for the emergence and maintenance of CB-ECFC-like cells."
https://openalex.org/W2086439867,"Visual attention enhances the responses of visual neurons that encode the attended location. Several recent studies have shown that attention also decreases correlations between fluctuations in the responses of pairs of neurons (termed spike count correlation or r(SC)). These results are consistent with two hypotheses. First, attention-related changes in rate and r(SC) might be linked (perhaps through a common mechanism), with attention always decreasing r(SC). Second, attention might either increase or decrease r(SC), possibly depending on the role of the neurons in the behavioral task. We recorded simultaneously from dozens of neurons in area V4 while monkeys performed a discrimination task. We found strong evidence in favor of the second hypothesis, showing that attention can flexibly increase or decrease correlations depending on whether the neurons provide evidence for the same or opposite choices. These results place important constraints on models of the neuronal mechanisms underlying cognitive factors."
https://openalex.org/W1983908479,"Valuation is a key tenet of decision neuroscience, where it is generally assumed that different attributes of competing options are assimilated into unitary values. Such values are central to current neural models of choice. By contrast, psychological studies emphasize complex interactions between choice and valuation. Principles of neuronal selection also suggest that competitive inhibition may occur in early valuation stages, before option selection. We found that behavior in multi-attribute choice is best explained by a model involving competition at multiple levels of representation. This hierarchical model also explains neural signals in human brain regions previously linked to valuation, including striatum, parietal and prefrontal cortex, where activity represents within-attribute competition, competition between attributes and option selection. This multi-layered inhibition framework challenges the assumption that option values are computed before choice. Instead, our results suggest a canonical competition mechanism throughout all stages of a processing hierarchy, not simply at a final choice stage."

In this study, we aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying ART-induced cell death. We first confirmed that ART induces apoptotic cell death in cancer cells. Interestingly, we found that ART preferably accumulates in the lysosomes and is able to activate lysosomal function via promotion of lysosomal V-ATPase assembly. Furthermore, we found that lysosomes function upstream of mitochondria in reactive oxygen species production. Importantly, we provided evidence showing that lysosomal iron is required for the lysosomal activation and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production induced by ART. Finally, we showed that ART-induced cell death is mediated by the release of iron in the lysosomes, which results from the lysosomal degradation of ferritin, an iron storage protein. Meanwhile, overexpression of ferritin heavy chain significantly protected cells from ART-induced cell death. In addition, knockdown of nuclear receptor coactivator 4, the adaptor protein for ferritin degradation, was able to block ART-mediated ferritin degradation and rescue the ART-induced cell death.

On the other hand, lysosomes are known to play a critical role in autophagy; at the maturation/degradation stage, autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes to form autolysosomes for degradation (13Mizushima N.

At present, the effects of ART on autophagy and lysosome remain controversial. It has been reported that ART inhibits autophagy via inhibition of lysosomal turnover without affecting lysosomal functions in breast cancer cells (15Hamacher-Brady A. Stein H.A. Turschner S.

Moreover, ART-induced cancer cell death was shown to be dependent on lysosomes, although the mechanism is unclear (15Hamacher-Brady A. Stein H.A. Turschner S. Toegel I. Mora R. Jennewein N.

Chem. 2011; 286: 6587-6601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Iron is an essential nutrient, and its intracellular availability is tightly regulated. One of the key regulatory mechanisms involves ferritin (17Rouault T.A. The role of iron regulatory proteins in mammalian iron homeostasis and disease.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 406-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). Ferritin functions as the major iron storage protein in mammals and consists of 24 protein subunits that can store up to 4,500 atoms of iron per ferritin (18Ford G.C. Harrison P.M. Rice D.W. Smith J.M. Treffry A. White J.L. Yariv J. Ferritin: design and formation of an iron-storage molecule.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1984; 304: 551-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). There are two subunits of ferritin, ferritin heavy chain (FTH) and ferritin light chain (FTL). FTH has a ferroxidase function that can catalyze extracellular iron into nontoxic ferric iron form and store this form of iron in the ferritin complex (19Harrison P.M. Arosio P. The ferritins: molecular properties, iron storage function and cellular regulation.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 161-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (2246) Google Scholar). Ferritin is stable in iron-rich conditions, whereas it is rapidly degraded under conditions of iron starvation (20Asano T. Komatsu M. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Ishikawa F. Mizushima N. Iwai K. Distinct mechanisms of ferritin delivery to lysosomes in iron-depleted and iron-replete cells.Mol. Cell Biol. 2011; 31: 2040-2052Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Ferritin has been reported to be degraded either in the lysosomes or by the proteasomes depending on the cellular stimulants (21De Domenico I. Ward D.M. Kaplan J. Specific iron chelators determine the route of ferritin degradation.Blood. 2009; 114: 4546-4551Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Recently, the nuclear receptor coactivator 4 (NCOA4) was identified as the cargo for the ferritin degradation via autophagic pathway, and the autophagic turnover of ferritin is termed ferritinophagy (22Mancias J.D. Wang X. Gygi S.P. Harper J.W. Kimmelman A.C. Quantitative proteomics identifies NCOA4 as the cargo receptor mediating ferritinophagy.Nature. 2014; 509: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar). To date, the effect of ART on ferritin and the link between free iron ions and lysosomal function in ART-induced cell death have not been well studied. In this study, we aimed to clarify the effect of ART on autophagy and lysosomal function as well as to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms of how lysosome is involved in ART-induced cell death. Here, we utilized a blue fluorescence-tagged ART to investigate its localization, and our results clearly showed that ART accumulates in lysosome. Interestingly, we found that ART promotes lysosomal function via engaging lysosomal V-ATPase. More importantly, we provided clear evidence demonstrating that ferritin degradation via lysosomes is essential for ART-induced cell death. The results from our study shed new light on the molecular mechanisms underlying ART-induced cell death and support the development of this important anti-malaria drug as a cancer therapeutic agent.

All cell lines were maintained in DMEM (Sigma-Aldrich, D1152) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, SV30160.03) in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. After the indicated times of designated treatments, cells were collected and rinsed with PBS. The whole cell lysates were prepared in the Laemmli buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 2% SDS, 2 mm DTT, phosphatase inhibitor, and proteinase inhibitor mixture). Protein concentrations were determined by the DCTM protein assay (Bio-Rad, 162-0177). An equal amount of protein was resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad). After blocking with StartingBlock blocking buffers (Thermo Scientific, 37538), the membrane was probed with designated first and second antibodies, developed with the enhanced chemiluminescence method (Thermo Scientific, 34076), and visualized using Kodak Image Station 4000R (Eastman Kodak Co.).

All of the other antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology: anti-lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) antibody (catalog nos. 3243S and 9091S), anti-phospho-S6 (catalog no. 2211), anti-S6 (catalog no. 2217), caspase 3 (catalog no. 9662), and anti-PARP-1 (catalog no. 9542). Briefly, cells were first cultured on 8-well Lab-TekTM chambered coverglass (Thermo Scientific, 155411) overnight, followed by designated treatment. All of the confocal images were obtained with 60× oil objective (numerical aperture 1.4) lenses of Olympus Fluoview FV1000. The images were processed with FV10-ASW 3.0 Viewer software. Cell death was estimated by morphological changes under phase-contrast microscopy and quantified by a propidium iodide (PI; 5 μg/ml) exclusion assay coupled with flow cytometry (BD Biosciences). Western blotting was also used to indicate the cell death via PARP-1 and caspase-3 cleavages. The cells were treated with blue fluorescent ART (20 μm, LynxTag-ARTTMASBlue, from BioLynx Technologies) with or without bafilomycin A1 (BAF) (50 nm) in full DMEM for 30 min. Subsequently, 50 nm LysoTracker Red DND-99 (LTR; Invitrogen, L7528) or MitoTracker Red CMXRos (MTR; Invitrogen, M7512) was added for 30 min. The cells were washed with PBS twice, and DMEM full medium was added into the well, followed by observation under the confocal microscope. After the designated treatments, cells were incubated with 50 nm LTR or LysoTracker Green DND-26 (LTG; Invitrogen, L7526) reagents in full DMEM for 30 min for labeling and tracking acidic organelles in live cells. For labeling mitochondria, the cells were incubated with 50 nm MTR in PBS for 15 min and then washed twice with PBS followed by incubation of full DMEM for the imaging or collection for flow cytometry. The cells in the chambered coverglass were observed under a confocal microscope. The cells from the 24-well plate were collected, and the fluorescence intensities of 10,000 cells/sample were measured by flow cytometry using the BD FACS cytometer (BD Biosciences). We recorded the fluorescence of LTR and MTR using the FL-2 channel of FACS (BD Biosciences). Lysosomal function was also estimated by the cathepsin B and L enzymatic activity. After designated treatment, cells were further loaded with Magic RedTM cathepsin B (Immunochemistry Technologies, 938) or cathepsin L (Immunochemistry Technologies, 942) reagents for 30 min. The cells in the chambered coverglass were observed under a confocal microscope. The cells from the 24-well plate were collected, and the fluorescence intensities of 10,000 cells per sample were measured by flow cytometry. We recorded the fluorescence of Magic Red using the FL-2 channel of FACS. Lysosomal protein proteolysis was estimated by DQ Red BSA (Invitrogen, D12051) staining. Cells were first incubated with DQ Red BSA for 1 h and then washed with PBS two times, followed by the designated treatment. The cells in the chambered coverglass were observed under a confocal microscopy. The cells from the 24-well plate were collected, and the fluorescence intensities of 10,000 cells/sample were measured by flow cytometry. We recorded the fluorescence of DQ Red BSA using the FL-3 channel of FACS. Cells were first cultured in an 8-well chambered coverglass overnight. After the designated treatment, cells were first fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at 37 °C and then permeabilized with 0.01% saponin in PBS for 10 min. After blocking with 1% BSA in PBS for 30 min, cells were incubated with V-ATPase B2 primary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, SC-166122) in a 1:100 dilution overnight at 4 °C. On the second day, the cells were then incubated with LAMP1 in a 1:100 dilution (Cell Signaling Technology, 9091S) for 3 h at room temperature, followed by Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Invitrogen, A-11029) and Alexa Fluor 555 donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Invitrogen, A-31572). The cells were examined using a confocal microscope, and representative cells were selected and photographed. The use of two different proximity ligation assay probes with amplifiable DNA reporter enabled us to visualize and quantify the protein-protein interactions in situ (24Jarvius M. Paulsson J.

Treated cells were first fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at 37 °C and then permeabilized with 0.01% saponin in PBS for 10 min, followed by blocking with 1% BSA in PBS for 30 min. Cells were then incubated with anti V-ATPase V1 domain subunit B2 (V1B2) and anti-V-ATPase V0 domain subunit D1 (V0D1) in a 1:100 dilution, incubated overnight at 4 °C. The chamber was then performed with the procedure based on the manufacturer's instructions (Olink Bioscience). The scrambled RNAi oligonucleotides (Dharmacon, ON-TARGETplus Non-targeting Pool, D-001810–10-05) and siRNAs targeting ATG7 (Dharmacon, SMARTpool, ON-TARGETplus human ATG7, L-020112-00-0005; target sequences: CCAACACACUCGAGUCUUU, GAUCUAAAUCUCAAACUGA, GCCCACAGAUGGAGUAGCA, and GCCAGAGGAUUCAACAUGA), TFEB (Dharmacon, SMARTpool, ON-TARGETplus human TFEB, L-009798-00-0005; target sequences: CAACAGUGCUCCCAAUAGC, GCAGCCACCUGAAUGUGUA, UGAAAGGAGACGAAGGUUC, and GCAGAUGCCCAACACGCUA), and NCOA4 (Dharmacon, SMARTpool, ON-TARGETplus human NCOA4, L-010321-00-0005; target sequences: CAGAUUCACAGUUGCAUAA, ACAAAGAUCUAGCCAAUCA, ACAAGUGGCUGCUUCGAAA, and GAGAAGUGGUUAUAUCGAA) were transfected into HeLa cells using the DharmaFECT 4 Transfection Reagent (Dharmacon, T-2001-02) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After 48 h, the cells were subjected to the designated treatment. For plasmid transfection, HeLa cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA or FTH-FLAG plasmid using LipofectamineTM 2000 according to the manufacturer's protocol. After 24 h, the cells were treated as indicated. CM-H2DCFDA (Invitrogen, C6827) and MitoSOXTM Red (MSR; Invitrogen, M36008) were chosen for the detection of intracellular ROS and mitochondrial superoxide production, respectively. When CM-H2DCFDA passively diffuses into cells, its acetate groups are cleaved by intracellular esterases and subsequently oxidized by ROS and yield a fluorescent adduct, CM-DCF (25Aon M.A. Cortassa S.

Commun. 2007; 358: 203-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were first cultured in a Lab-TekTM chambered coverglass or 24-well plate overnight. After the designated treatments, cells were incubated with 5 μm MSR or 1 μm CM-H2DCFDA in PBS for 10 min. Then the MSR or CM-H2DCFDA was removed, and the cells were washed with PBS twice. The cells in the coverglass were incubated in full medium and observed under a confocal microscope. The cells in the 24-well plate were collected, and fluorescence intensity was measured. We recorded the fluorescence of CM-DCF using the FL-1 channel and MSR with the FL-2 channel of FACS (BD Biosciences). TFEB luciferase vector was provided by Dr. A. Ballabio (27Sardiello M. Palmieri M. di Ronza A. Medina D.L. Valenza M. Gennarino V.A. Di Malta C. Donaudy F. Embrione V. Polishchuk R.S. Banfi S. Parenti G. Cattaneo E. Ballabio A. A gene network regulating lysosomal biogenesis and function.Science. 2009; 325: 473-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1568) Google Scholar). The transient transfection of the TFEB luciferase vector was done in HeLa cells using LipofectamineTM 2000 transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's protocols. Renilla luciferase vector was used as a transfection control. The luciferase activity was measured at 48 h after transfection using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega, E1960) based on the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Briefly, following the treatments, the cell lysate was collected from each well after the addition of cell lysis reagent. After the addition of luciferase assay substrate, the firefly luciferase activity was determined using a luminometer (Promega), and the Renilla luciferase activity was then measured by adding the Stop & Glo substrate. RNA was extracted with the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, 217004). A reverse transcription reaction was performed using 1 μg of total RNA with iScriptTM Reverse Transcription Supermix for RT-qPCR (Bio-Rad, 170-8841). The mRNA expression levels were determined by real-time PCR using SsoFast EvaGreen Supermix (Bio-Rad, 172-5201AP) and the CFX96 Touch Real-time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as an internal control of RNA integrity. Real-time PCR was performed in triplicate. The primers used for FTH and FTL were purchased from Qiagen: Hs_FTH1_1_SG QuantiTect primer assay (QT00072681) and Hs_FTL_1_SG QuantiTect Primer Assay (QT00055860). All Western blot data and image data presented are representative of three independent experiments. The numeric data except for quantitative RT-PCR data are presented as mean ± S.D. from three independent experiments and analyzed using Student's t test. Quantitative RT-PCR data are presented as mean ± S.D. from two independent experiments (each in triplicate). ART has been shown to inhibit cell growth, induce radiosensitivity, and enhance TRAIL-induced apoptosis in human cervical cancer HeLa cells (28Luo J. Zhu W. Tang Y. Cao H. Zhou Y. Ji R. Zhou X. Lu Z.

Inhibition of human cancer cell line growth and human umbilical vein endothelial cell angiogenesis by artemisinin derivatives in vitro.Pharmacol. Res. 2003; 48: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). In this study, we first examined the cytotoxicity of ART on HeLa cells. We found that ART (50 μm for 48 h) caused evident cell death in HeLa cells, as assessed by morphological changes (Fig. 1A, top), Hoechst staining for chromatin condensation (Fig. 1A, bottom), and quantitatively through PI-live cell exclusion test (Fig. 1, B and C). ART-induced cell death was also found to be dose-dependent in HeLa cells (Fig. 1D). In addition to its toxicity, treatment with ART alone or combined with N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Phe-Ala-fluoromethylketone (Z-VAD-fmk) was also shown to reduce the number of cells (Fig. 1A), which is consistent with the earlier findings that ART inhibits cancer cell proliferation (6Zhao Y.

To further examine the type of cell death induced by ART, we tested the protective effect of the general caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk on ART-mediated cell death. As shown in Fig. 1, A–C, the cell death induced by ART was dramatically protected by Z-VAD-fmk. Consistently, we also observed cleavage of both caspase-3 (17 kDa) and PARP-1 (89 kDa), both classical markers of apoptotic cell death in HeLa cells treated with ART (Fig. 1E). The caspase-3 and PARP cleavage can also be blocked by Z-VAD-fmk (Fig. 1F). Similar results were also observed in HepG2 cells (data not shown). In order to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying ART-mediated cell death, we utilized LynxTag-ARTTM ASBlue, a blue fluorescence-tagged ART, to investigate its cellular localization. As shown in Fig. 2, ART was found to be predominantly localized in lysosomes, as evidenced by its co-staining with LTR (Fig. 2A) and LAMP1 (Fig. 2B). There was little colocalization of ART with MTR (Fig. 2C). Altogether, the data showed that ART accumulates in the lysosomes. Notably, treatment with BAF, an inhibitor of lysosomal acidification via inhibition of the lysosomal V-ATPase activity (31Yoshimori T. Yamamoto A. Moriyama Y. Futai M. Tashiro Y. Bafilomycin A1, a specific inhibitor of vacuolar-type H+-ATPase, inhibits acidification and protein degradation in lysosomes of cultured cells.J. Biol.

Here, we combine theory, quantitative imaging, and perturbations to analyze how tissue geometry, cell divisions, and mechanics interact to shape the presumptive enveloping layer (pre-EVL) on the zebrafish embryonic surface. We find that, under geometrical constraints, pre-EVL flattening is regulated by surface cell number changes following differentially oriented cell divisions. The division pattern is, in turn, determined by the cell shape distribution, which forms under geometrical constraints by cell-cell mechanical coupling. An integrated mathematical model of this shape-division feedback loop recapitulates empirical observations. Surprisingly, the model predicts that cell shape is robust to changes of tissue surface area, cell volume, and cell number, which we confirm in vivo. Further simulations and perturbations suggest the parameter linking cell shape and division orientation contributes to epithelial diversity. Together, our work identifies an evolvable design logic that enables robust cell-level regulation of tissue-level development."

Present study explores the ameliorative effect of withanolide A, a major component of withania root extract and its molecular mechanism against hypoxia induced memory impairment. Withanolide A was administered to male Sprague Dawley rats before a period of 21 days pre-exposure and during 07 days of exposure to a simulated altitude of 25,000 ft. Glutathione level and glutathione dependent free radicals scavenging enzyme system, ATP, NADPH level, γ-glutamylcysteinyl ligase (GCLC) activity and oxidative stress markers were assessed in the hippocampus. Expression of apoptotic marker caspase 3 in hippocampus was investigated by immunohistochemistry. Transcriptional alteration and expression of GCLC and Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)–related factor 2 (Nrf2) were investigated by real time PCR and immunoblotting respectively. Exposure to hypobaric hypoxia decreased reduced glutathione (GSH) level and impaired reduced gluatathione dependent free radical scavenging system in hippocampus resulting in elevated oxidative stress. Supplementation of withanolide A during hypoxic exposure increased GSH level, augmented GSH dependent free radicals scavenging system and decreased the number of caspase and hoescht positive cells in hippocampus. While withanolide A reversed hypoxia mediated neurodegeneration, administration of buthionine sulfoximine along with withanolide A blunted its neuroprotective effects. Exogenous administration of corticosterone suppressed Nrf2 and GCLC expression whereas inhibition of corticosterone synthesis upregulated Nrf2 as well as GCLC. Thus present study infers that withanolide A reduces neurodegeneration by restoring hypoxia induced glutathione depletion in hippocampus. Further, Withanolide A increases glutathione biosynthesis in neuronal cells by upregulating GCLC level through Nrf2 pathway in a corticosterone dependenet manner."
https://openalex.org/W2054558091,"Catastrophic flooding resulting from extreme meteorological events has occurred more frequently and drawn great attention in recent years in China. In coastal areas, extreme precipitation and storm tide are both inducing factors of flooding and therefore their joint probability would be critical to determine the flooding risk. The impact of storm tide or changing environment on flooding is ignored or underestimated in the design of drainage systems of today in coastal areas in China. This paper investigates the joint probability of extreme precipitation and storm tide and its change using copula-based models in Fuzhou City. The change point at the year of 1984 detected by Mann-Kendall and Pettitt's tests divides the extreme precipitation series into two subsequences. For each subsequence the probability of the joint behavior of extreme precipitation and storm tide is estimated by the optimal copula. Results show that the joint probability has increased by more than 300% on average after 1984 (α = 0.05). The design joint return period (RP) of extreme precipitation and storm tide is estimated to propose a design standard for future flooding preparedness. For a combination of extreme precipitation and storm tide, the design joint RP has become smaller than before. It implies that flooding would happen more often after 1984, which corresponds with the observation. The study would facilitate understanding the change of flood risk and proposing the adaption measures for coastal areas under a changing environment."

Most evidence is derived from homogenous populations such as health professionals. Large community-based analyses in more diverse samples are lacking. Methods We studied the association of protein type and major dietary protein sources and risk for incident CHD in 12,066 middle-aged adults (aged 45–64 at baseline, 1987–1989) from four U.S. communities enrolled in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study who were free of diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease at baseline. Dietary protein intake was assessed at baseline and after 6 years of follow-up by food frequency questionnaire. Our primary outcome was adjudicated coronary heart disease events or deaths with following up through December 31, 2010. Cox proportional hazard models with multivariable adjustment were used for statistical analyses. Results During a median follow-up of 22 years, there were 1,147 CHD events. In multivariable analyses total, animal and vegetable protein were not associated with an increased risk for CHD before or after adjustment. In food group analyses of major dietary protein sources, protein intake from red and processed meat, dairy products, fish, nuts, eggs, and legumes were not significantly associated with CHD risk. The hazard ratios [with 95% confidence intervals] for risk of CHD across quintiles of protein from poultry were 1.00 [ref], 0.83 [0.70–0.99], 0.93 [0.75–1.15], 0.88 [0.73–1.06], 0.79 [0.64–0.98], P for trend = 0.16). Replacement analyses evaluating the association of substituting one source of dietary protein for another or of decreasing protein intake at the expense of carbohydrates or total fats did not show any statistically significant association with CHD risk. Conclusion Based on a large community cohort we found no overall relationship between protein type and major dietary protein sources and risk for CHD."
https://openalex.org/W2074491062,"Histone ubiquitination at DNA double strand breaks facilitates the recruitment of downstream repair proteins; however, how the ubiquitination is dynamically regulated during repair and terminated after repair is not well understood. Here we report that the histone H2A deubiquitinase USP16 interacts with HERC2, fine-tunes the ubiquitin signal during repair, and importantly, is required for terminating the ubiquitination signal after repair. HERC2 interacts with the coiled-coil domain of USP16 through its C-terminal HECT domain. HERC2 knockdown affects the levels of ubiquitinated H2A through the action of USP16. In response to DNA damage, USP16 levels increase, and this increase is dependent on HERC2. Increased USP16 serves as a negative regulator for DNA damage-induced ubiquitin foci formation and affects downstream factor recruitment and DNA damage response. The functional significance of USP16 is further manifested in human Down syndrome patient cells, which contain three copies of USP16 genes and have altered cellular response to DNA damage. Finally, we demonstrated that USP16 could deubiquitinate both H2A Lys-119 and H2A Lys-15 ubiquitination in vitro. Therefore, this study identifies USP16 as a critical regulator of DNA damage response and H2A Lys-15 ubiquitination as a potential target of USP16."
https://openalex.org/W2090722621,"The Cas9/CRISPR system has become a popular choice for genome editing. In this system, binding of a single guide (sg) RNA to a cognate genomic sequence enables the Cas9 nuclease to induce a double-strand break at that locus. This break is next repaired by an error-prone mechanism, leading to mutation and gene disruption. In this study we describe a range of refinements of the method, including stable cell lines expressing Cas9, and a PCR based protocol for the generation of the sgRNA. We also describe a simple methodology that allows both elimination of Cas9 from cells after gene disruption and re-introduction of the disrupted gene. This advance enables easy assessment of the off target effects associated with gene disruption, as well as phenotype-based structure-function analysis. In our study, we used the Fan1 DNA repair gene as control in these experiments. Cas9/CRISPR-mediated Fan1 disruption occurred at frequencies of around 29%, and resulted in the anticipated spectrum of genotoxin hypersensitivity, which was rescued by re-introduction of Fan1."
https://openalex.org/W2029613061,"The type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a bacterial nanomachine for the transport of effector molecules into prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. It involves the assembly of a tubular structure composed of TssB and TssC that is similar to the tail sheath of bacteriophages. The sheath contracts to provide the energy needed for effector delivery. The AAA(+) ATPase ClpV disassembles the contracted sheath, which resets the systems for reassembly of an extended sheath that is ready to fire again. This mechanism is crucial for T6SS function. In Vibrio cholerae, ClpV binds the N terminus of TssC within a hydrophobic groove. In this study, we resolved the crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa ClpV1 and observed structural alterations in the hydrophobic groove. The modification in the ClpV1 groove is matched by a change in the N terminus of TssC, suggesting the existence of distinct T6SS classes. An accessory T6SS component, TagJ/HsiE, exists predominantly in one of the classes. Using bacterial two-hybrid approaches, we showed that the P. aeruginosa homolog HsiE1 interacts strongly with ClpV1. We then resolved the crystal structure of HsiE1 in complex with the N terminus of HsiB1, a TssB homolog and component of the contractile sheath. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that these differences distinguish T6SS classes that resulted from a functional co-evolution between TssB, TssC, TagJ/HsiE, and ClpV.

However, the lack of genomic information regarding this species limits our understanding of the genetics and biological mechanisms in Trachinotus ovatus. In this study, high throughput transcriptome sequencing was used to obtain comprehensive genomic information in Trachinotus ovatus. Principal Findings Transcriptome sequencing was performed by using Illumina paired-end sequencing technology. The 98,534,862 high quality reads were yielded, and were de novo assembled into 156,094 unigenes with an average sequence length of 1179 bp. Transcriptome annotation revealed that 75,586 and 67,923 unigenes were functionally annotated in the NCBI non-redundant database and Swiss-Prot protein database, respectively. Functional analysis demonstrated that 67,923 unigenes were grouped into 25 Cluster of Orthologous Groups (COG) functional categories, 37,976 unigenes were clustered into 61 Gene Ontology (GO) terms, and 38,172 unigenes were assigned to 275 different Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways. Based on the transcriptome dataset, a large number of unigenes associated with reproduction, growth and immunity were identified. Furthermore, a total number of 38,794 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) were discovered and 16 polymorphic loci were characterized in Trachinotus ovatus. Conclusion/Significance The present study is the first transcriptome analysis of a fish species belonging to the genus Trachinotus and provides a valuable genomic resource for novel gene discovery, gene expression and regulation studies, and the identification of genetic markers in Trachinotus ovatus and the other fish of the genus Trachinotus."
https://openalex.org/W2148236129,"Sterols are essential biological molecules in the majority of life forms. Sterol reductases including Δ(14)-sterol reductase (C14SR, also known as TM7SF2), 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR7) and 24-dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR24) reduce specific carbon-carbon double bonds of the sterol moiety using a reducing cofactor during sterol biosynthesis. Lamin B receptor (LBR), an integral inner nuclear membrane protein, also contains a functional C14SR domain. Here we report the crystal structure of a Δ(14)-sterol reductase (MaSR1) from the methanotrophic bacterium Methylomicrobium alcaliphilum 20Z (a homologue of human C14SR, LBR and DHCR7) with the cofactor NADPH. The enzyme contains ten transmembrane segments (TM1-10). Its catalytic domain comprises the carboxy-terminal half (containing TM6-10) and envelops two interconnected pockets, one of which faces the cytoplasm and houses NADPH, while the other one is accessible from the lipid bilayer. Comparison with a soluble steroid 5β-reductase structure suggests that the reducing end of NADPH meets the sterol substrate at the juncture of the two pockets. A sterol reductase activity assay proves that MaSR1 can reduce the double bond of a cholesterol biosynthetic intermediate, demonstrating functional conservation to human C14SR. Therefore, our structure as a prototype of integral membrane sterol reductases provides molecular insight into mutations in DHCR7 and LBR for inborn human diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2040628873,"Infections by influenza A viruses (IAV) are a major health burden to mankind. The current antiviral arsenal against IAV is limited and novel drugs are urgently required. Medicinal plants are known as an abundant source for bioactive compounds, including antiviral agents. The aim of the present study was to characterize the anti-IAV potential of a proanthocyanidin-enriched extract derived from the aerial parts of Rumex acetosa (RA), and to identify active compounds of RA, their mode of action, and structural features conferring anti-IAV activity. In a modified MTT (MTTIAV) assay, RA was shown to inhibit growth of the IAV strain PR8 (H1N1) and a clinical isolate of IAV(H1N1)pdm09 with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 2.5 µg/mL and 2.2 µg/mL, and a selectivity index (SI) (half-maximal cytotoxic concentration (CC50)/IC50)) of 32 and 36, respectively. At RA concentrations>1 µg/mL plaque formation of IAV(H1N1)pdm09 was abrogated. RA was also active against an oseltamivir-resistant isolate of IAV(H1N1)pdm09. TNF-α and EGF-induced signal transduction in A549 cells was not affected by RA. The dimeric proanthocyanidin epicatechin-3-O-gallate-(4β→8)-epicatechin-3′-O-gallate (procyanidin B2-di-gallate) was identified as the main active principle of RA (IC50 approx. 15 µM, SI≥13). RA and procyanidin B2-di-gallate blocked attachment of IAV and interfered with viral penetration at higher concentrations. Galloylation of the procyanidin core structure was shown to be a prerequisite for anti-IAV activity; o-trihydroxylation in the B-ring increased the anti-IAV activity. In silico docking studies indicated that procyanidin B2-di-gallate is able to interact with the receptor binding site of IAV(H1N1)pdm09 hemagglutinin (HA). In conclusion, the proanthocyanidin-enriched extract RA and its main active constituent procyanidin B2-di-gallate protect cells from IAV infection by inhibiting viral entry into the host cell. RA and procyanidin B2-di-gallate appear to be a promising expansion of the currently available anti-influenza agents."
https://openalex.org/W1982192849,"Purpose Intra-arterial chemotherapy is a promising strategy for intra-ocular retinoblastoma. Neutropenia is the most commonly encountered systemic toxicity and in this study we aimed to determine the risk factors associated with the development of severe (≥grade 3) neutropenia. Methods Retrospective review of 187 evaluable cycles of melphalan-containing intra-arterial chemotherapy from the first three cycles administered to 106 patients with intra-ocular retinoblastoma from May 2006 to June 2011. Cycles were considered to be evaluable if (1) blood count results were available in the 7 to 14 days post-treatment interval and (2) concurrent intravenous chemotherapy was not administered. Toxicity was assessed via the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. Results 54 cycles (29%) were associated with grade 3 (n = 43) or grade 4 (n = 11) neutropenia. Multivariate stepwise logistic regression revealed that a higher melphalan dose (>0.40 mg/kg) was significantly associated with severe neutropenia during all 3 cycles (odds ratio during cycle one 4.11, 95% confidence interval 1.33–12.73, p = 0.01), but the addition of topotecan and/or carboplatin were not. Prior treatment with systemic chemotherapy was not associated with severe neutropenia risk in any analysis. Conclusions Intra-arterial melphalan-based chemotherapy can cause severe neutropenia, especially when a dose of greater than 0.40 mg/kg is administered. Further study with a larger sample may be warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2084736928,"A new synthetic biology circuit using recombinases to control the timing of downstream steps allows 1,000-fold differences in signal between on and off states, facilitating cell identification and selective turn-on of cytotoxic agents. Transient delivery of gene circuits is required in many potential applications of synthetic biology, yet the pre-steady-state processes that dominate this delivery route pose major challenges for robust circuit deployment. Here we show that site-specific recombinases can rectify undesired effects by programmable timing of gene availability in multigene circuits. We exemplify the concept with a proportional sensor for endogenous microRNA (miRNA) and show a marked reduction in its ground state leakage due to desynchronization of the circuit's repressor components and their repression target. The new sensors display a dynamic range of up to 1,000-fold compared to 20-fold in the standard configuration. We applied the approach to classify cell types on the basis of miRNA expression profile and measured >200-fold output differential between positively and negatively identified cells. We also showed major improvements in specificity with cytotoxic output. Our study opens new venues in gene circuit design via judicious temporal control of circuits' genetic makeup."
https://openalex.org/W2019688585,"Uncontrolled proliferation, a major feature of cancer cells, is often triggered by the malfunction of cell cycle regulators such as protein kinases. Recently, cell cycle-related protein kinases have become attractive targets for anti-cancer therapy, because they play fundamental roles in cellular proliferation. However, the protein kinase-targeted drugs that have been developed so far do not show impressive clinical results and also display severe side effects; therefore, there is undoubtedly a need to investigate new drugs targeting other protein kinases that are critical in cell cycle progression. Vaccinia-related kinase 1 (VRK1) is a mitotic kinase that functions in cell cycle regulation by phosphorylating cell cycle-related substrates such as barrier-to-autointegration factor (BAF), histone H3, and the cAMP response element (CRE)-binding protein (CREB). In our study, we identified luteolin as the inhibitor of VRK1 by screening a small-molecule natural compound library. Here, we evaluated the efficacy of luteolin as a VRK1-targeted inhibitor for developing an effective anti-cancer strategy. We confirmed that luteolin significantly reduces VRK1-mediated phosphorylation of the cell cycle-related substrates BAF and histone H3, and directly interacts with the catalytic domain of VRK1. In addition, luteolin regulates cell cycle progression by modulating VRK1 activity, leading to the suppression of cancer cell proliferation and the induction of apoptosis. Therefore, our study suggests that luteolin-induced VRK1 inhibition may contribute to establish a novel cell cycle-targeted strategy for anti-cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2041366444,"Probes that form covalent bonds with RNA molecules on the basis of their chemical reactivity would advance our ability to study the transcriptome. We developed a set of electrophilic activity-based RNA probes designed to react with unusually nucleophilic RNAs. We used these probes to identify reactive genome-encoded RNAs, resulting in the discovery of a 42-nt catalytic RNA from an archaebacterium that reacts with a 2,3-disubstituted epoxide at N7 of a specific guanosine. Detailed characterization of the catalytic RNA revealed the structural requirements for reactivity. We developed this catalytic RNA into a general tool to selectively conjugate a small molecule to an RNA of interest. This strategy enabled up to 500-fold enrichment of target RNA from total mammalian RNA or from cell lysate. We demonstrated the utility of this approach by selectively capturing proteins in yeast cell lysate that bind the ASH1 mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W2075855559,"Despite the widespread use of CD34-family sialomucins (CD34, podocalyxin and endoglycan) as vascular endothelial cell markers, there is remarkably little known of their vascular function. Podocalyxin (gene name Podxl), in particular, has been difficult to study in adult vasculature as germ-line deletion of podocalyxin in mice leads to kidney malformations and perinatal death. We generated mice that conditionally delete podocalyxin in vascular endothelial cells (PodxlΔEC mice) to study the homeostatic role of podocalyxin in adult mouse vessels. Although PodxlΔEC adult mice are viable, their lungs display increased lung volume and changes to the matrix composition. Intriguingly, this was associated with increased basal and inflammation-induced pulmonary vascular permeability. To further investigate the etiology of these defects, we isolated mouse pulmonary endothelial cells. PodxlΔEC endothelial cells display mildly enhanced static adhesion to fibronectin but spread normally when plated on fibronectin-coated transwells. In contrast, PodxlΔEC endothelial cells exhibit a severely impaired ability to spread on laminin and, to a lesser extent, collagen I coated transwells. The data suggest that, in endothelial cells, podocalyxin plays a previously unrecognized role in maintaining vascular integrity, likely through orchestrating interactions with extracellular matrix components and basement membranes, and that this influences downstream epithelial architecture."
https://openalex.org/W2085288290,"Adrenarche is a key early life event that marks middle childhood at approximately 7 years of age. Earlier work with British-Bangladeshi migrant women suggested that environmental conditions experienced before adrenarche influence adult reproductive function. We therefore investigated whether Bangladeshi children who migrate to the United Kingdom (UK) reach adrenarche earlier than non-migrants in Bangladesh or the United Kingdom.Healthy girls, aged 5-16 years, were recruited from schools in Sylhet, Bangladesh and London, England comprising four groups: Sylhetis (n = 165), first-generation migrants to the United Kingdom (n = 42), second-generation girls (n = 162), and British girls of European origin (n = 50). Anthropometric measurements were collected together with questionnaire data for migration and socioeconomic characteristics. Saliva samples were assayed for dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEAS) using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Multiple linear regressions tested for group differences in anthropometric and socioeconomic variables and DHEAS levels. Median ages at adrenarche (DHEAS>400 pg/ml) were estimated using Weibull regression models for parametric survival analysis. Hazard ratios for reaching adrenarche earlier and 95% confidence intervals (CI), both unadjusted and adjusted for anthropometric variables, were estimated from the survival analyses. First-generation migrants had a median age at adrenarche (5.3 years) that was significantly earlier than Sylheti (7.2), second-generation (7.4), and European (7.1) girls. In univariate analyses, first-generation girls reached adrenarche significantly earlier than Sylhetis [HR (CI): 2.8 (1.4-5.5]. In multivariate models, first generation girls still reached adrenarche earlier than Sylhetis after adjusting for height [HR(CI): 1.9 (0.9-4.1)] and weight [HR(CI):1.7 (0.8-3.8)], but these results were attenuated.We suggest that rapid catch-up growth experienced by first generation girls during early childhood may explain their advanced adrenarche. The environmental conditions leading to an earlier adrenarche, as well as the health implications of this early transition, merit further exploration."
https://openalex.org/W2019190656,"Auditory feedback is required to maintain fluent speech. At present, it is unclear how attention modulates auditory feedback processing during ongoing speech. In this event-related potential (ERP) study, participants vocalized/a/, while they heard their vocal pitch suddenly shifted downward a ½ semitone in both single and dual-task conditions. During the single-task condition participants passively viewed a visual stream for cues to start and stop vocalizing. In the dual-task condition, participants vocalized while they identified target stimuli in a visual stream of letters. The presentation rate of the visual stimuli was manipulated in the dual-task condition in order to produce a low, intermediate, and high attentional load. Visual target identification accuracy was lowest in the high attentional load condition, indicating that attentional load was successfully manipulated. Results further showed that participants who were exposed to the single-task condition, prior to the dual-task condition, produced larger vocal compensations during the single-task condition. Thus, when participants' attention was divided, less attention was available for the monitoring of their auditory feedback, resulting in smaller compensatory vocal responses. However, P1-N1-P2 ERP responses were not affected by divided attention, suggesting that the effect of attentional load was not on the auditory processing of pitch altered feedback, but instead it interfered with the integration of auditory and motor information, or motor control itself."
https://openalex.org/W2095171614,"Although there was a report about the seasonal variation in Wuhan city, it only analyzed the prevalence data of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) cases, and just studied the seasonality by subgroup of smear positive and negative from 2006 to 2010 by spectral analysis. In this study, we investigated the seasonality of the total newly notified pulmonary TB cases by subgroups such as time period, sex, age, occupation, district, and sputum smear result from 2004 to 2013 in Wuhan by a popular seasonal adjustment model (TRAMO-SEATS).Monthly pulmonary TB cases from 2004 to 2013 in Wuhan were analyzed by the TRAMO-SEATS seasonal adjustment program. Seasonal amplitude was calculated and compared within the subgroups.From 2004 to 2013, there were 77.76 thousand newly notified pulmonary TB cases in Wuhan, China. There was a dominant peak spring peak (March) with seasonal amplitude of 56.81% and a second summer peak (September) of 43.40%, compared with the trough month (December). The spring seasonal amplitude in 2004-2008 was higher than that of 2009-2013(P<0.05). There were no statistical differences for spring seasonal amplitude within subgroups of gender, age, district, and sputum smear result (P>0.05). However, there were significant differences in spring seasonal amplitude by occupation, with amplitude ranging from 59.37% to 113.22% (P<0.05). The summer seasonal amplitude in 2004-2008 was higher than that of 2009-2013(P<0.05). There were no statistical differences in summer seasonal amplitude within subgroups of gender, district, sputum smear result(P>0.05). There were significant differences in summer seasonal amplitude by age, with amplitude ranging from 36.05% to 100.09% (P<0.05). Also, there were significant differences in summer seasonal amplitude by occupation, with amplitude ranging from 43.40% to 109.88% (P<0.05).There was an apparent seasonal variation in pulmonary TB cases in Wuhan. We speculated that spring peak in our study was most likely caused by the increased reactivation of the latent TB due to vitamin D deficiency and high PM2.5 concentration, while the summer peak was mainly resulted from the enhanced winter transmission due to indoor crowding in winter, overcrowding of public transportation over the period of the Spring Festival and health care seeking delay in winter."
https://openalex.org/W2166585484,"The transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) constitutes a focal element in the adaptive immune response against infected or malignantly transformed cells. TAP shuttles proteasomal degradation products into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum for loading of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. Here, the heterodimeric TAP complex was purified and reconstituted in nanodiscs in defined stoichiometry. We demonstrate that a single heterodimeric core-TAP complex is active in peptide binding, which is tightly coupled to ATP hydrolysis. Notably, with increasing peptide length, the ATP turnover was gradually decreased, revealing that ATP hydrolysis is coupled to the movement of peptide through the ATP-binding cassette transporter. In addition, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations show that the observed 22 lipids are sufficient to form an annular belt surrounding the TAP complex. This lipid belt is essential for high affinity inhibition by the herpesvirus immune evasin ICP47. In conclusion, nanodiscs are a powerful approach to study the important role of lipids as well as the function, interaction, and modulation of the antigen translocation machinery."
https://openalex.org/W2049658618,"MicroRNA-19 (miR-19) was recently identified as the key oncogenic component of the polycistronic miR-17∼92 cluster, also known as oncomiR-1, which is frequently upregulated or amplified in multiple tumor types. However, the gene targets and the pathways underlying the tumor-promoting activity of miR-19 still remain largely elusive. CtIP/RBBP8 promotes DNA-end resection, a critical step in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) by homologous recombination (HR), and is considered to function as a tumor suppressor. In this study, we show that miR-19 downregulates CtIP expression by binding to two highly conserved sequences located in the 3'-untranslated region of CtIP mRNA. We further demonstrate that CtIP expression is repressed by miR-19 during continuous genotoxic stress in a p53-dependent manner. Finally, we report that miR-19 impairs CtIP-mediated DNA-end resection, which results in reduced HR levels and DNA damage hypersensitivity. By downregulating CtIP, miR-19 overexpression suppresses the faithful repair of DSBs that is crucial for genome maintenance. Our findings thus provide new mechanistic insight into the oncogenic role of the miR-17∼92 cluster."

In the present study, we purified the glycosylated extracellular domain of calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) (ECD) (residues 20–612), containing either complex or high mannose N-glycan structures depending on the host cell line employed for recombinant expression. Both glycosylated forms of the CaSR ECD were purified as dimers and exhibit similar secondary structures with ∼50% α-helix, ∼20% β-sheet content, and a well buried Trp environment.

https://openalex.org/W2120515360,"Background Chronic inflammation has been postulated to be one mediating mechanism explaining the association between low socioeconomic position (SEP) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). We sought to examine the association between life course SEP and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in adulthood, and to evaluate the extent to which health-risk behaviors and metabolic alterations mediate this association. Additionally, we explored the possible modifying influence of gender. Methods and Findings Our analytical sample comprised 13,371 participants from ELSA-Brasil baseline, a multicenter prospective cohort study of civil servants. SEP during childhood, young adulthood, and adulthood were considered. The potential mediators between life course SEP and CRP included clusters of health-risk behaviors (smoking, low leisure time physical activity, excessive alcohol consumption), and metabolic alterations (obesity, hypertension, low HDL, hypertriglyceridemia, and diabetes). Linear regression models were performed and structural equation modeling was used to evaluate mediation. Although lower childhood SEP was associated with higher levels of CRP in adult life, this association was not independent of adulthood SEP. However, CRP increased linearly with increasing number of unfavorable social circumstances during the life course (p trend <0.001). The metabolic alterations were the most important mediator between cumulative SEP and CRP. This mediation path accounted for 49.5% of the total effect of cumulative SEP on CRP among women, but only 20.2% among men. In consequence, the portion of the total effect of cumulative SEP on CRP that was mediated by risk behaviors and metabolic alterations was higher among women (55.4%) than among men (36.8%). Conclusions Cumulative SEP across life span was associated with elevated systemic inflammation in adulthood. Although health-risk behaviors and metabolic alterations were important mediators of this association, a sizable fraction of this association was not mediated by these factors, suggesting that other pathways might play a role, especially among men."

We cross-tabulated all active diagnoses with treatments recommended by guidelines for each diagnosis. Then, we identified potential therapeutic conflicts and classified them as either major or minor conflicts according to their clinical significance.166 emergency inpatients with multimorbidity were included. The mean number of active diagnoses per patient was 6.6 (SD±3.4). We identified a total of 239 therapeutic conflicts in 49% of the of the study population. In 29% of the study population major therapeutic conflicts, in 41% of the patients minor therapeutic conflicts occurred.Therapeutic conflicts are common among multimorbid patients, with one out of two experiencing minor, and one out of three experiencing major therapeutic conflicts. Clinical practice guidelines need to address frequent therapeutic conflicts in patients with co-morbid medical conditions."

Local epithelial stem cells appear to play a major role in such mucosal renewal or pathological regeneration. Less is clear about the involvement of multipotent stem cells from blood in GI repair. We attempted to explore a role of bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BMMSCs) and soluble stem cell factor (SCF) in GI mucosa regeneration in a rat model of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Methods BMMSCs labelled with the fluorescent dye PKH26 from donor rats were transfused into rats suffering indomethacin-induced GI injury. Experimental effects by BMMSCs transplant and SCF were determined by morphometry of intestinal mucosa, double labeling of PKH26 positive BMMSCs with endogenous proliferative and intestinal cell markers, and western blot and PCR analyses of the above molecular markers in the recipient rats relative to controls. Results PKH26 positive BMMSCs were found in the recipient mucosa, partially colocalizing with the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), Lgr5, Musashi-1 and ephrin-B3. mRNA and protein levels of PCNA, Lgr5, Musashi-1 and ephrin-B3 were elevated in the intestine in BMMSCs-treated rats, most prominent in the BMMSCs-SCF co-treatment group. The mucosal layer and the crypt layer of the small intestine were thicker in BMMSCs-treated rats, more evident in the BMMSCs-SCF co-treatment group. Conclusion BMMSCs and SCF participate in but may play a synergistic role in mucosal cell regeneration following experimentally induced intestinal injury. Bone marrow stem cell therapy and SCF administration may be of therapeutic value in IBD."

Research focusing on the diversity and distribution of relevant autotrophs is significant to our comprehension of the biosphere. In this study, a draft genome of a bacterium from candidate phylum SBR1093 was reconstructed with the metagenome of an industrial activated sludge. Based on comparative genomics, this autotrophy may occur via a newly discovered carbon fixation path, the hydroxypropionate-hydroxybutyrate (HPHB) cycle, which was demonstrated in a previous work to be uniquely possessed by some genera from Archaea. This bacterium possesses all of the thirteen enzymes required for the HPHB cycle; these enzymes share 30∼50% identity with those in the autotrophic species of Archaea that undergo the HPHB cycle and 30∼80% identity with the corresponding enzymes of the mixotrophic species within Bradyrhizobiaceae. Thus, this bacterium might have an autotrophic growth mode in certain conditions. A phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene reveals that the phylotypes within candidate phylum SBR1093 are primarily clustered into 5 clades with a shallow branching pattern. This bacterium is clustered with phylotypes from organically contaminated environments, implying a demand for organics in heterotrophic metabolism. Considering the types of regulators, such as FnR, Fur, and ArsR, this bacterium might be a facultative aerobic mixotroph with potential multi-antibiotic and heavy metal resistances. This is the first report on Bacteria that may perform potential carbon fixation via the HPHB cycle, thus may expand our knowledge of the distribution and importance of the HPHB cycle in the biosphere."

We recently described an RNAi high throughput screening performed in the Hepa-1 mouse hepatoma cell line, which revealed that SIN3A is necessary for the induction of CYP1A1-dependent ethoxyresorufin-o-deethylase (EROD) enzymatic activity by TCDD. In the current studies, we sought to provide insight into the role of SIN3A in this process, particularly because studies on SIN3A have usually focused on its repressive activity on transcription. We report that ectopic expression of human SIN3A in Hepa-1 cells enhanced EROD induction by TCDD and efficiently rescued TCDD induction of EROD activity in cells treated with an siRNA to mouse SIN3A, thus validating a role for SIN3A in CYP1A1 induction. We demonstrate that SIN3A is required for TCDD induction of the CYP1A1 protein in Hepa-1 cells but not for expression of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor protein. In addition, siRNAs for SIN3A decreased TCDD-mediated induction of CYP1A1 mRNA and EROD activity in human hepatoma cell line Hep3B. We establish that TCDD treatment of Hepa-1 cells rapidly increases the degree of SIN3A binding to both the proximal promoter and enhancer of the Cyp1a1 gene and demonstrate that increased binding to the promoter also occurs in human Hep3B, HepG2, and MCF-7 cells. These studies establish that SIN3A physically interacts with the CYP1A1 gene and extends the transcriptional role of SIN3A to a gene that is very rapidly and dramatically induced."
https://openalex.org/W2086252362,"Copy number variations (CNVs) have been previously associated with several different neurodevelopmental psychiatric disorders, such as autism, schizophrenia, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The present study consisted of a pilot genome-wide screen for CNVs in a cohort of 16 patients with early-onset obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and 12 mentally healthy individuals, using array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) on 44K arrays. A small rare paternal inherited microdeletion (∼64 kb) was identified in chromosome 15q13.3 of one male patient with very early onset OCD. The father did not have OCD. The deletion encompassed part of the FMN1 gene, which is involved with the glutamatergic system. This finding supports the hypothesis of a complex network of several genes expressed in the brain contributing for the genetic risk of OCD, and also supports the glutamatergic involvement in OCD, which has been previously reported in the literature."
https://openalex.org/W2134215615,"The Arabidopsis constitutive induced resistance 1 (cir1) mutant displays salicylic acid (SA)-dependent constitutive expression of defence genes and enhanced resistance to biotrophic pathogens. To further characterise the role of CIR1 in plant immunity we conducted epistasis analyses with two key components of the SA-signalling branch of the defence network, ENHANCED DISEASE SUSCEPTIBILITY1 (EDS1) and PHYTOALEXIN DEFICIENT4 (PAD4). We demonstrate that the constitutive defence phenotypes of cir1 require both EDS1 and PAD4, indicating that CIR1 lies upstream of the EDS1-PAD4 regulatory node in the immune signalling network. In light of this finding we examined EDS1 expression in cir1 and observed increased protein, but not mRNA levels in this mutant, suggesting that CIR1 might act as a negative regulator of EDS1 via a post-transcriptional mechanism. Finally, as environmental temperature is known to influence the outcome of plant-pathogen interactions, we analysed cir1 plants grown at 18, 22 or 25°C. We found that susceptibility to Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst) DC3000 is modulated by temperature in cir1. Greatest resistance to this pathogen (relative to PR-1:LUC control plants) was observed at 18°C, while at 25°C no difference in susceptibility between cir1 and control plants was apparent. The increase in resistance to Pst DC3000 at 18°C correlated with a stunted growth phenotype, suggesting that activation of defence responses may be enhanced at lower temperatures in the cir1 mutant."
https://openalex.org/W2038324331,"Background The arginine vasopressin receptor (AVPR) and oxytocin receptor (OXTR) genes have been demonstrated to contribute to prosocial behavior. Recent research has focused on the manner by which these simple receptor genes influence prosociality, particularly with regard to the AVP system, which is modulated by the clock gene. The clock gene is responsible for regulating the human biological clock, affecting sleep, emotion and behavior. The current study examined in detail whether the influences of the OXTR and AVPR1b genes on prosociality are dependent on the clock gene. Methodology/Principal Findings This study assessed interactions between the clock gene (rs1801260, rs6832769) and the OXTR (rs1042778, rs237887) and AVPR1b (rs28373064) genes in association with individual differences in prosociality in healthy male Chinese subjects (n = 436). The Prosocial Tendencies Measure (PTM-R) was used to assess prosociality. Participants carrying both the GG/GA variant of AVPR1b rs28373064 and the AA variant of clock rs6832769 showed the highest scores on the Emotional PTM. Carriers of both the T allele of OXTR rs1042778 and the C allele of clock rs1801260 showed the lowest total PTM scores compared with the other groups. Conclusions The observed interaction effects provide converging evidence that the clock gene and OXT/AVP systems are intertwined and contribute to human prosociality."
https://openalex.org/W2041482453,"High solar radiation along with extreme transparency leads to high penetration of solar radiation in the Red Sea, potentially harmful to biota inhabiting the upper water column, including zooplankton. Here we show, based on experimental assessments of solar radiation dose-mortality curves on eight common taxa, the mortality of zooplankton in the oligotrophic waters of the Red Sea to increase steeply with ambient levels of solar radiation in the Red Sea. Responses curves linking solar radiation doses with zooplankton mortality were evaluated by exposing organisms, enclosed in quartz bottles, allowing all the wavelengths of solar radiation to penetrate, to five different levels of ambient solar radiation (100%, 21.6%, 7.2%, 3.2% and 0% of solar radiation). The maximum mortality rates under ambient solar radiation levels averaged (±standard error of the mean, SEM) 18.4±5.8% h−1, five-fold greater than the average mortality in the dark for the eight taxa tested. The UV-B radiation required for mortality rates to reach ½of maximum values averaged (±SEM) 12±5.6 h−1% of incident UVB radiation, equivalent to the UV-B dose at 19.2±2.7 m depth in open coastal Red Sea waters. These results confirm that Red Sea zooplankton are highly vulnerable to ambient solar radiation, as a consequence of the combination of high incident radiation and high water transparency allowing deep penetration of damaging UV-B radiation. These results provide evidence of the significance of ambient solar radiation levels as a stressor of marine zooplankton communities in tropical, oligotrophic waters. Because the oligotrophic ocean extends across 70% of the ocean surface, solar radiation can be a globally-significant stressor for the ocean ecosystem, by constraining zooplankton use of the upper levels of the water column and, therefore, the efficiency of food transfer up the food web in the oligotrophic ocean."
