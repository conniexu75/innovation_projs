https://openalex.org/W1579899042,"The fatty acid contents of 26 different serum albumin preparations representing different species and obtained from various commercial sources have been determined. Some samples had surprisingly little fatty acid contamination, but it was found that other samples contained between 2 and 3 moles of acid per mole of protein, in confirmation of earlier reports. Treatment of these samples with charcoal at low pH resulted in the virtually complete removal of fatty acids. The conditions for such treatment were investigated as a function of the type of fatty acid, pH, and the amount of charcoal required. Charcoal treatment removed at least 99% of albumin-bound radioactive fatty acids under optimal conditions, whereas the amount of protein adsorbed onto charcoal was 4.9%. The protein that remained in solution following separation of the charcoal appeared to be native, as judged by a number of criteria, including analytical ultracentrifugation, optical rotatory dispersion, the ability to bind fatty acids, and the ability to bind the fluorescent dye, 8-anilinonaphthalene-1-sulfonic acid, as well as several other fluorescence parameters. Fluorescence spectra of human serum albumin samples indicated that impurities are sometimes present which can be removed by charcoal at neutral pH. A possible explanation for the gentleness of charcoal treatment is offered. Acid-charcoal treatment is a much more rapid method of removing lipid impurities than other methods previously described."
https://openalex.org/W1603492764,"Abstract A method is described for the simultaneous measurement of partial specific volumes and molecular weights of proteins and other substances by sedimentation equilibrium experiments in H2O and D2O (or D2O18) solutions. In effect, the method is a differential sedimentation equilibrium technique based upon the change produced in the equilibrium concentration distribution when the density of the solution is increased by the use of D2O (or D2O18). The equations used for the two parallel sedimentation equilibrium experiments in H2O and D2O (or in H2O and D2O18) account for deuterium exchange by the incorporation of a factor which changes only slightly for different proteins and can be estimated with sufficient accuracy from knowledge of the composition of the solute. Experiments were conducted on H2O and D2O solutions of adenosine, ferredoxin, ribonuclease, myoglobin, α-chymotrypsinogen, and bovine plasma albumin, and the resulting values of the partial specific volumes and molecular weights were in excellent agreement with currently accepted values. In addition excellent results were obtained for myoglobin and α-chymotrypsinogen from parallel sedimentation equilibrium experiments on H2O and D2O18 solutions. With D2O18 solutions the potential accuracy in the determination of partial specific volumes is substantially greater than with D2O since the density of D2O18 is so much greater and the consequent effect on the redistribution of the solute molecules is so large. The method is direct and no more laborious than a conventional sedimentation equilibrium experiment, does not depend on knowledge of the solute concentration, yields partial specific volumes accurate to better than 1.0%, and can be used in certain situations with impure samples."
https://openalex.org/W1479846693,"Abstract The two chicken creatine kinases from brain and from muscle have been purified as well as the chicken hybrid enzyme. The brain and muscle enzymes from the rabbit have also been purified and compared to the chicken enzymes. There are significant differences in amino acid composition between the brain and muscle types; the hybrid enzyme has an intermediate composition. Peptide maps of the muscle and brain types further indicate that the sequences of the two types are considerably different. Antibodies prepared against the chicken muscle type enzyme do not cross-react, as measured by complement fixation methods or by Ouchterlony tests, with the chicken brain type enzymes; antibodies against the purified brain type enzyme do not react with the muscle type enzyme. However, the hybrid enzyme reacts with both antibodies, although quantitatively less than with the pure enzymes. The two brain type enzymes from the chicken and rabbit, or the two muscle enzymes, are more similar in their properties than are the brain and muscle forms of one species."
https://openalex.org/W1584619265,"Abstract An enzyme from Clostridium perfringens capable of catalyzing the cleavage of the carbon-nitrogen bond in 3α,7α, 12α-trihydroxy-5β-cholan-24-oylglycine is described. The 15-fold purified enzyme hydrolyzes 3α,12α-dihydroxy-5β-cholan-24-oylglycine at a slightly faster rate than glycocholic acid. The Km for glycocholic acid in 0.01 m acetate buffer, pH 5.6, is approximately 8.0 x 10-3 m. 3,7,12-Triketo-5β-cholan-24-oylglycine, a substrate analogue, and 3,7,12-triketo-5β-cholanoic acid are enzyme inhibitors. Cholic acid exhibited competitive product inhibition in the present system. The enzyme is inhibited by sulfhydryl group inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W1726818992,"Four purified creatine kinases have been studied with respect to their s value, sedimentation equilibrium, and elution volume on gel filtration. These studies indicate that the creatine kinases all have approximately the same molecular weight, near 80,000. The chicken muscle enzyme at low pH in the presence of a reducing agent had a molecular weight one-half that of the native enzyme. On electrophoresis in starch gel the enzymes all migrated differently. The two creatine kinases from muscle (chicken and rabbit) remained near the origin while the brain enzymes (chicken and rabbit) migrated toward the cathode. The dissociation of the enzymes in urea has been studied; when two dissimilar enzymes are dissociated together in urea and allowed to recombine, both parent enzymes, plus a hybrid enzyme, are formed. Two moles of iodoacetate per mole of enzyme will inactivate the creatine kinases; p-hydroxymercuribenzoate will bind to the enzymes but upon dilution recovery of enzymic activity occurs. The results indicate that creatine kinase has a dimeric structure."
https://openalex.org/W1523710595,"Abstract A new sickling hemoglobin variant designated hemoglobin Charlem (Hb Ch) migrated slightly anodally to the position of hemoglobin C on electrophoresis at pH 8.6, and has been shown to have the structure αa2 β6 glu → val, 73 asp → asn2. Hemoglobin Ch comprised 40% of the hemoglobin in individuals of two generations of an American Negro family and is the first instance in which two amino acid substitutions in a single polypeptide chain have been defined in a human hemoglobin variant. Hemoglobin Ch appeared not to differ significantly from Hb A in its oxygen equilibria, ultraviolet spectra of the oxy and deoxy forms, and titratable sulfhydryl groups. Probably by virtue of its β6 val substitution, Hb Ch shared with Hb S (αa2 β6 glu → val2) the properties of erythrocyte sickling and relative insolubility and gelation of the deoxyhemoglobin. However, gelation experiments suggested that the β73 asn substitution resulted in a decrease in the intermolecular interactions of deoxyhemoglobin Ch as compared with deoxyhemoglobin S, and implied conformational differences between the two deoxyhemoglobins."
https://openalex.org/W1976238604,"It has been shown that human test subjects have the ability, under controlled laboratory conditions, to use echoes to detect the presence or absence of targets placed before them. In addition, blind and sighted persons have been able to detect a target monaurally, to make simple shape discriminations, and to locate a target in space. Signal, environmental, and individual variability affect performance in a measurable fashion."
https://openalex.org/W1981546667,"Rats deficient in thiamine were allowed to drink saccharin-flavored water. They were then given an injection of thiamine which caused their intake of the nonnutritive fluid to increase. Delay of the intramuscular injection up to 30 minutes had no effect upon the acquisition of this conditioning. Presumably, this delay reflects specialization in the central integrative mechanisms which serve these afferent modalities."
https://openalex.org/W1481643460,"1. Human pancreatic juice contains amylase, lipase, ribonuclease, deoxyribonuclease, proelastase, procarboxypeptidase A, procarboxypeptidase B, chymotrypsinogen, and trypsinogen, as well as a trypsin inhibitor. The level of the inhibitor is such that 1 ml of pancreatic juice containing 4 mg of protein will inhibit about 0.08 mg of bovine trypsin. The inhibitor is a small, basic protein, soluble in 2.5% trichloracetic acid. It differs from the Kunitz bovine inhibitor in its slower migration rate in polyacrylamide gels at pH 4.1 and in its kinetic properties. 2. The proteins of human pancreatic juice have been separated into anionic and cationic fractions at pH 6.5. The cationic proteins include amylase, lipase, RNase, and pancreatic trypsin inhibitor; the anionic proteins include chymotrypsinogen, procarboxypeptidases A and B, and two components showing tryptic activity. 3. The cationic proteins have been separated on polyacrylamide gels and identified by histochemical methods. Zones containing amylase, lipase, RNase, and pancreatic trypsin inhibitor have been localized."
https://openalex.org/W1530906906,"Abstract An examination of the subcellular distribution of alanine aminotransferase activity in pig cardiac tissue showed that about 10% of the total activity was bound to particulate material, with the highest specific activity in the sarcosomal fraction. The soluble enzyme was obtained in a high state of purity, as indicated by sedimentation velocity, starch gel electrophoresis, and spectral analyses. It had a sedimentation coefficient of 6.0 and an estimated molecular weight of about 100,000. Spectral, fluorescent, and optical rotatory properties of the enzyme are described. The enzyme-substrate interactions were studied by kinetic and spectral methods. Kinetic parameters of the enzyme-catalyzed reaction involving amino transfer from l-alanine to α-ketoglutarate were determined at 37°, pH 7.8. At pH 6.9, pyruvate was found to bind effectively to the phosphopyridoxal form of the enzyme and, thereby, competitively inhibit amino transfer from both alanine and glutamate to pyruvate."
https://openalex.org/W1666075882,"Abstract The phospholipid N-methyltransferase system in microsomes of normal Neurospora crassa was compared with those in two choline-deficient mutant strains. The normal transferase system catalyzed the three transmethylations leading to the synthesis of lecithin, and the three phosphatide bases involved in this sequence of reactions were isolated as isotope-labeled products. The microsomes of a mutant, strain 34486, proved to have a subnormal phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase activity. The microsomes of a second mutant, strain 47904, could not catalyze the twostep conversion of phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine to lecithin at a measurable rate and therefore were deficient in the phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine N-methyltransferase found in the normal strain. Evidence was presented to corroborate the view based on previous studies that a single enzyme in N. crassa converts phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine to lecithin."
https://openalex.org/W1490710835,"Abstract A kinetic study has been made of phosphorylase a from rabbit brain and of phosphorylase b from rabbit brain and muscle. In the case of brain phosphorylase a the kinetic data indicate strong cooperative interaction between glycogen and phosphate sites and between glycogen and adenylate sites. Under the experimental conditions there was found little evidence of interaction between phosphate and adenylate sites, although from a few experiments under different conditions and from the work of others, some interaction is possible. Although there are presumably at least two glycogen sites and two phosphate sites in the active form of the enzyme, there was no sign of interaction of one glycogen site with another or one phosphate site with another. The kinetic behavior of brain phosphorylase a is similar to that reported earlier for muscle phosphorylase a except for the failure to show the strong phosphate-adenylate interaction characteristic of the latter. The muscle enzyme also has much greater affinity for glycogen and somewhat lower affinity for adenylate and phosphate. The kinetic behavior of phosphorylase b is more complicated than that of phosphorylase a. The data for muscle phosphorylase b can be adequately explained by a formulation involving two binding sites each for 5'-adenylate and inorganic phosphate, and one site for glycogen. Random order of addition is indicated with marked interaction between many of the sites. Of the 17 independent kinetic constants demanded by this formulation 10 have been provisionally evaluated. The kinetic pattern of brain phosphorylase b resembles that of the muscle enzyme but the apparent affinities for phosphate and adenylate are greater. Raising the temperature to 38° profoundly decreases apparent affinity of all four enzymes for glycogen, with comparatively little effect on apparent affinity for phosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1557496869,"Cell-free extracts of yeast convert 14C-mevalonic acid into squalene, lanosterol, zymosterol, and sterols more polar than ergosterol. Formation of two of the more polar sterols (Es1 and Es2) has also been demonstrated with methyl-labeled methionine and with 14C-adenosylmethionine as precursors. The two polar sterols, Es1 and Es2, formed from radioactive methyl donors yield labeled formaldehyde on chemical degradation. Es2 is reduced to a mixture of ergosterol and ergostanol on partial reduction with Raney nickel and hydrogen. The tentative structure 5,7,22,24(28)-ergostatetraene-3β-ol is assigned to one of the sterols (Es2). Intact yeast cells convert zymosterol to Es2 anaerobically, and aerobically they convert Es2 to ergosterol. Evidence for the role of Es1 and Es2 as intermediates in ergosterol biosynthesis is discussed, and it is suggested that a C27 sterol is the acceptor in the transmethylation reaction."
https://openalex.org/W2029877204,Substances labeled with phosphate-32 and carbon-14 and applied to hypoglossal nuclei in rabbits traveled down the hypoglossal nerves and after several days began entering only the muscle cells of the tongue. Prevention of axonal delivery on one side caused unilateral labeling of the tongue. Labeled substances delivered by extracellular fluids labeled all cells indiscriminately. The axonal conveyance of neuroplasmic components to peripheral cells may provide a basis for trophic influences of neurons on other cells.

https://openalex.org/W1561865504,"Rat liver microsome fractions contain two general kinds of inhibitors of amino acid incorporation in vitro. The first is derived from lysosomes contaminating the microsome fractions. Lysosomes may be removed from rough vesicles (ribosomes plus endoplasmic membranes) by a density centrifugation technique. Lysosomal inhibition of incorporation in vitro is much more prominent in normal than in regenerating liver microsomes even though the lysosome content is the same, suggesting that normal lysosomes release their degradative enzymes more readily during incubation. Rough vesicles from normal and regenerating livers are alike in activity, as are the polyribosomes derived therefrom. The second inhibitor is a heat-labile factor associated with the endoplasmic reticular membrane, which requires oxidized glutathione under certain conditions and which can be reversed by an excess of guanosine triphosphate or sulfhydryl reagents. The inhibitor-sensitive step is the transfer of amino acids from aminoacyl soluble ribonucleic acid to protein. Enzymes catalyzing the transfer of amino acids from soluble ribonucleic acid to protein are less than half as active (per mg of supernatant protein) in normal as in regenerating liver when tested at limiting concentration and in the absence of GTP. Their activity is equalized in the presence of an excess of GTP. The enzymes from normal liver also increase in activity upon aging at 0°, to become more nearly equal in activity to the enzymes from regenerating liver."
https://openalex.org/W1491205821,"The properties of the particulate starch synthetase from different sources were studied. The specificity of this enzyme toward a number of sugar nucleotides and its Km values and maximum velocities were determined. The properties of the particulate enzyme were considerably changed when the structure of the granules was modified by mechanical disruption. After this treatment uridine diphosphate glucose was no longer a substrate, while the activity with adenosine diphosphate glucose was enhanced. The new specificity is similar to that of the soluble glucan synthetases. The results obtained would suggest that both the synthetase bound to the granule and the soluble synthetase could be different forms of the same enzyme. The addition of branching enzyme considerably increased the incorporation of glucosyl moieties into the intact grain or into the amylopectin left after the granule was ground. The action of α- and β-amylase and of concentrated urea solutions on the starch grains was also studied."

https://openalex.org/W2018884416,"Electrical stimulation of those points in the lateral hypothalamic area of the brain that promote feeding, but not of other points, elicited intense hoarding activity in satiated rats, similar to that produced by long-term food deprivation. This result suggests that hoarding of food is organized by a hypothalamic drive mechanism sensitive to the effects of long-term nutritional depletion."
https://openalex.org/W1587862303,"Abstract The peptides produced by the tryptic digestion of S-aminoethylated bovine pancreatic ribonuclease support the generally accepted amino acid sequence for this enzyme and also demonstrate the usefulness as well as some special limitations of the aminoethylation procedure. The relative extents of hydrolysis at different peptide bonds were estimated from the yields of purified peptides. Under the conditions used here for tryptic hydrolysis the approximate cleavage of arginyl and lysyl bonds was estimated at 83%, while the corresponding cleavage of aminoethylcysteinyl bonds averaged 56%. Exceptions to these generalizations included the very limited cleavage of lysyl and aminoethylcysteinyl bonds which were adjacent to other basic amino acid residues, and, of course, the negligible splitting of the lysyl proline bond and the amino-terminal lysyl glutamic acid bond. The extent of cleavage at aminoethylcysteinyl bonds appeared to show greater variability than that at lysyl and arginyl bonds."
https://openalex.org/W1982450865,"A factor capable of effecting passive transfer in vivo of delayed hypersensitivity to tuberculin to recipients that are tuberculin negative was isolated from the dialyzate of disrupted leukocytes of tuberculin-positive individuals. After this factor was incubated with cultures of peripheral leukocytes from tuberculin-negative individuals, the addition of purified protein derivative of tubercle bacilli resulted in leukocyte stimulation similar to that observed after addition of purified protein derivative to leukocytes from tuberculin-positive individuals."
https://openalex.org/W1970818849,Among the identifiable cells in the abdominal ganglion of Aplysia californica are five that generate bursting rhythms endogenous to the cells. In the four bursting cells of the left upper quadrant the rhythm is modulated by a unitary inhibitory postsynaptic potential; in the bursting cell of the right lower quadrant the rhythm is modulated by a unitary excitatory postsynaptic potential. Both the excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials are mediated by separate branches of a single interneuron. The pharmacological properties of the double action interneuron as well as those of the follower cells suggest that a single transmitter (acetylcholine) is involved in both the excitatory and the in-hibitory action of the interneuron.
https://openalex.org/W1565945181,"Abstract An enzyme system present in both mammalian and dogfish liver was found to catalyze the conversion of cetyl alcohol to wax. The product was isolated by column chromatography and repeated thin layer chromatography. It was identified by thin layer chromatography, by analysis of the hydrolysis products, and by gas chromatography. Microsomal and supernatant fractions of liver were active. Synthesis was stimulated by detergents such as Triton X-100, Tween 20, and bile salts. Wax formation occurred without activation, i.e. formation of acyl coenzyme A. With an enzyme preparation from which lipids had been substantially removed wax synthesis required both long chain fatty acids and cetyl alcohol. It is postulated that the synthesis of waxes from long chain alcohols and fatty acids without activation is possible in an environment from which water is essentially excluded and can be envisioned as resulting from the interaction of two nonpolar compounds and an enzyme in a micellar state."

https://openalex.org/W1570896459,"Abstract A urinary metabolite of dl-carnitine has been identified as β-methylcholine, a decarboxylation product of the parent compound. An enzymatic assay for the decarboxylation of carnitine-1-14C to β-methylcholine and 14CO2 in vitro has been developed. The enzyme has been found in rat liver, kidney, muscle, and adrenals, and in largest amount in the heart. Intact mitochondria have the highest activity, and the enzyme has been purified about 30-fold from a soluble fraction of sonically treated mitochondria. Initial velocities of the reaction have shown an apparent Km for dl-carnitine of 2.4 x 10-4. Acetyl- and palmitylcarnitine seem to have higher Km values. Adenosine triphosphate and Mg++ are essential for activity; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, biotin, and pyridoxal phosphate are not. The activity of carnitine decarboxylase appears to be increased in vivo under conditions of increased fatty acid oxidation. The possible physiological significance of this decarboxylation is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1527135177,"Abstract Glucose-1-14C and glucose 6-phosphate-1-14C have been incubated with hemidiaphragm and intact diaphragm in a bicarbonate buffer. The relative incorporation of 14C from these two substrates into glycogen, CO2, lactate, and protein indicates the existence of two pools of glucose-6-P in the preparations. If this interpretation of the data is correct, one pool is accessible to glucose and glucose-6-P; CO2 and lactate are formed in this pool and their formation is not responsive to insulin. Exogenous glucose-6-P can have only minimal access, if at all, to the second pool. Glycogen is formed in this pool from glucose and its formation is responsive to insulin. While the two pools cannot be assigned with certainty to the muscle cell, evidence is presented which suggests that they are located in the muscle cell and that they are not an artifact of the preparations."
https://openalex.org/W1660328142,"The pyridoxal phosphate-containing glycine decarboxylase from Peptococcus glycinophilus exhibited fluorescence emission peaks at 390 and 500 mµ when activated at 340 and 420 mµ, respectively. Removal of the pyridoxal phosphate resulted in the loss of the 500 mµ peak, but did not affect the 390 mµ peak. When the holoenzyme was reduced with sodium borohydride only a single emission peak at 390 mµ was detectable, but the intensity of the emission was approximately 10-fold greater than the emission at 390 mµ of the nonreduced holoenzyme or of either the reduced or nonreduced apoenzyme. Estimation of the molar ratio of pyridoxal phosphate to enzyme protein was achieved by comparing the increase in fluorescence at 390 mµ, the increase in ultraviolet absorption at 430 mµ, and the increase in catalytic activity of a known amount of apoenzyme upon incubation with increasing amounts of pyridoxal phosphate. It was found that each mole of enzyme bound 2 moles of pyridoxal phosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1481873437,"Abstract The substrate specificity of soluble alanine aminotransferase from pig heart was examined. On the basis of competitive inhibition studies it was concluded that, in many cases, the low reactivities of enzyme-substrate analogue complexes were due to the effect of the amino acid side chains on the maximum reaction velocity rather than to a change in the Michaelis constant. Formate was found to stimulate alanine aminotransferase-catalyzed amino transfer from alanine to either pyruvate or α-ketoglutarate, but to inhibit that from glutamate to either α-ketoglutarate or pyruvate. Rates of removal of the α-hydrogen atoms of glutamate and alanine in D2O were affected by formate in the same manner as were the rates of transamination. Other monocarboxylate anions inhibited both transamination reactions. Formate acted as a noncompetitive inhibitor of α-aminobutyrate transamination. Results were interpreted to mean that activation by formate was due to its binding to the site which normally binds the γ-carboxyl group of glutamate. No effect of formate on the spectrum of the enzyme in the presence of an excess of alanine and pyruvate was observed, and its effect on the spectrum of the enzyme in the presence of excess glutamate and α-ketoglutarate was slight. Two other enzymes, d-alanine aminotransferase from Bacillus subtilis and aspartate aminotransferase from pig heart, catalyze amino transfer from alanine to α-ketoglutarate, at rates which are increased by monocarboxylate anions."
https://openalex.org/W1563841371,"The enzymatic synthesis of homocysteine (from homoserine and H2S) and cysteine (from serine and H2S) has been demonstrated in Neurospora crassa. Purification and properties of the enzyme, or enzymes, are described. Both homocysteine and cysteine synthetase are subject to end product feedback control by methionine, which appears to be noncompetitive inhibition. Repression of both activities by methionine and repression of cysteine synthetase by cysteine and homocysteine synthetase by homocysteine were observed. Regulation of both activities by cystathionine via its cleavage products, cysteine or homocysteine, is described. Cystathionineless and homocysteineless mutants grown with limiting methionine have both homocysteine and cysteine synthetase, or synthetases, with specific activities much lower than that of wild type grown in the presence of equivalent methionine. When the mutants and wild type are grown in the presence of limiting homocysteine, the specific activities for cysteine synthetase in both mutants are lower than that in wild type, and homocysteine synthetase is nearly totally repressed in both mutants. Cysteine mutants have cysteine synthetase and homocysteine synthetase with specific activities of the same magnitude as those for wild type grown with equivalent cysteine supplement. The demonstration of homocysteine and cysteine synthetase, or synthetases, permits the concept of direct and separate biosynthetic pathways for cysteine and methionine in Neurospora and obviates the requirement for cystathionine for forward transsulfuration."
https://openalex.org/W1557342740,"Abstract Phosphoenolpyruvate was formed by rabbit liver mitochondria during incubations in the presence of dinitrophenol with α-ketoglutarate and with other Krebs cycle intermediates as substrates. These intermediates, as indicated by experiments with labeled compounds, served as precursors for the carbon skeleton of the synthesized phosphoenolpyruvate. The phosphate, in the absence of exogenous supply, was derived from multiple endogenous sources; 70 to 90% was contributed by adenosine triphosphate, adenosine diphosphate, and inorganic phosphate. When α-ketoglutarate was the substrate, the synthesis of phosphoenolpyruvate was stimulated with addition of exogenous phosphate and was inhibited by arsenite and by arsenosophenylbutyrate. A portion of the phosphate, presumably, was activated by the succinic thiokinase reaction. On the other hand, when malate was the substrate, exogenous phosphate was not utilized, and the reaction was relatively insensitive to the arsenicals. In this case, phosphate was provided from endogenous sources by different, and as yet unidentified, reactions. In the presence of citrate, or in the presence of citrate and dinitrophenol, phosphoenolpyruvate was displaced from the mitochondria with inorganic phosphate but with only small losses of other organic phosphate compounds."
https://openalex.org/W1650221334,"Abstract Formiminotetrahydrofolate cyclodeaminase has been purified approximately 40-fold from lyophilized cells of Clostridium cylindrosporum. The purified enzyme is homogeneous by ultracentrifugation, and the molecular weight is estimated as approximately 38,000. The affinity constant for (-)-formiminotetrahydrofolate is 2.8 x 10-5 m. The formimino derivatives of tetrahydropteroyl-l-aspartate and tetrahydropteroyltri-l-glutamate (γ linkage) were synthesized, and the kinetic constants were determined. The activity of the enzyme is inhibited strongly by (±)-tetrahydrofolate and several other pteridine derivatives, as well as by metal ions. The enzyme has optimum activity at pH 7.2. The spectral evidence obtained suggested that the reaction is reversible to a small extent at pH 8.2."
https://openalex.org/W1654493962,Abstract The capacity of the mature human red cell membrane to synthesize palmitylcarnitine has been demonstrated. The localization of carnitine palmityltransferase in a membrane is consonant with the previously proposed function of carnitine as a carrier of activated long chain fatty acyl groups across a mitochondrial barrier. The presence of carnitine palmityltransferase in the red cell membrane raises the possibility that long chain fatty acylcarnitine might play a role in translocating long chain fatty acids across cell surface membranes.
https://openalex.org/W1539172843,"Abstract Carboxamidomethyl derivatives of sperm whale metmyoglobin were prepared by reaction at pH 6.8 with iodoacetamide. The modified protein is similar to previously studied carboxymethyl preparations and shows many of the properties of the native, unmodified protein. Preparations were obtained with compositions in the following ranges, expressed as moles of histidine derivative per mole of protein: histidine 4.8 to 7.5; dicarboxamidomethylhistidine, 1.6 to 4.6; 1-carboxamidomethylhistidine, trace to 0.5; and 3-carboxamidomethylhistidine, 1.6 to 2.6. Lysine was converted to the extent of 0.5 to 2.4 residues into the dicarboxamidomethyl derivative, out of a total of 19 lysine residues. The cupric complexes of the modified preparations are relatively soluble and easily studied in terms of maximum binding and of absorption and optical rotatory dispersion spectra near pH 6. The maximum binding of cupric ions was reduced by about the degree of conversion of histidine residues to the dicarboxamidomethyl derivative. The modified proteins were indistinguishable from the unmodified protein with respect to changes in absorption spectrum and optical rotatory dispersion in the Soret region upon copper (II) binding, and the changes were essentially fully reversible by EDTA. The modified proteins underwent smaller, reversible changes in rotation at 233 mµ on the addition of cupric ions. The inability of a dicarboxamidomethylhistidine derivative to react with cupric ion near pH 6 was confirmed with a derivative prepared from acetylglycylglycyl-l-histidine. The results are interpreted as indicating that the carboxamidomethyl modification reaction has little if any effect on the ability of cupric ions to disrupt the heme-protein relationship, but greatly alters the ability of cupric ions to bring about a second step in disruption of the protein structure."
https://openalex.org/W2076390258,"Arsanilic acid conjugates of polymers of L-typrosine, glutamic acid, and alanine are immunogenic and can elicit hapten-specific, delayed-hypersensitivity reactions in sensitized guinea pigs. Conjugates of the D-amino acid polymers are neither immunogenic nor capable of eliciting delayed reactions. Mixtures of small amounts of conjugates capable of eliciting a delayed reaction with larger amounts of D-amino acid polymer conjugates produce only small delayed reactions. I suggest that the delayed reaction is an active response requiring the continued participation of immunogenic material in sensitized animals; it is not the reaction of preformed antibody-like material with the antigenic determinant."
https://openalex.org/W25036243,"Abstract Factors affecting the respiratory control ratio of isolated rabbit heart mitochondria have been studied. The magnitude of the control ratio was shown to be affected by the presence of endogenous substrates, the nature of exogenous substrate, and the concentrations of mitochondria and of adenosine triphosphate. Higher control ratios were obtained in the presence of endogenous substrates and at a high mitochondrial concentration while lower control ratios usually resulted from an increase in ATP concentration. The endogenous substrates appear to act by maintaining a high capacity for activated respiration. An increase in mitochondrial concentration tended to increase the State 3, and to decrease the State 4 Qoo2. An increase in ATP concentration tended to increase the State 4 rate. The respiratory control ratio of a single preparation may vary as a result of alterations in any one or several of these factors. The occurrence of anomalous State 3 to 4 transitions has been noted and possible origins of the effect are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1585746208,"Abstract Rabbit heart mitochondria were isolated in the presence of low concentrations (150 to 250 µm) of pyruvate-2- or -3-14C to label the endogenous substrates. Chromatographic analyses of protein-free filtrates of the mitochondria indicated that the principal labeled endogenous substrates were citrate, malate, glutamate, and alanine. During storage of the mitochondria under anoxic conditions at 0°, radioactive citrate disappeared while aspartate and succinate increased. Continual changes in the composition of the endogenous substrates occurred during storage. When air was supplied to the mitochondrial suspension, the changes were similar to, but more rapid than, those occurring under anoxic conditions. Under aerobic conditions, however, radioactive succinate did not appear. Changes in total citrate, alanine, glutamate, and aspartate paralleled the changes in their radioactivity. Although partially metabolized, the endogenous substrates were largely retained by the mitochondria during repeated washing. During storage, in addition to metabolism, partial loss of some substrates into the medium was evident. Possible relationships of the metabolism of the endogenous substrates to the metabolic properties of isolated mitochondria are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1583495252,"Abstract Deoxyribose 5-phosphate aldolase was purified about 2000-fold from rat liver by ammonium sulfate fractionation and diethylaminoethyl cellulose and hydroxylapatite chromatography. The purified enzyme was free of triosephosphate isomerase. The Michaelis-Menten constants for acetaldehyde, d-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, and 2-deoxy-d-ribose 5-phosphate were found to be 2.67 x 10-4 m, 2.0 x 10-4 m, and 1.7 x 10-4 m, respectively. The equilibrium constant for the aldolase-catalyzed reaction was approximately 2 to 3 x 10-4 at pH 7.5 and 22°. The purified enzyme preparations were essentially inactive in the absence of a carboxylate ion activator such as citrate. Half-maximal activation of the enzyme by citrate, succinate, and glutarate occurred at 1 x 10-4 m, 2 x 10-4 m, and 5 x 10-4 m, respectively. The molecular weight of the purified enzyme was estimated to be 253,000 by sucrose density gradient techniques. Although the enzyme showed a marked tendency to aggregate to form a dimer and trimer, the presence of an activating carboxylate ion did not influence the observed aggregation."

More significantly, they were viable, in normal numbers, through two sex ual reorganizations. The strains ap parently did not sustain genetic dam age during the treatment. The tech niques offer considerable promise for the maintenance of breeding stocks in ciliated protozoans."
https://openalex.org/W1584323054,"Changes in the State 3 respiratory rate and the respiratory control ratio of isolated rabbit heart mitochondria with the use of pyruvate as the substrate parallel changes in, and depletion of, the endogenous substrates. The endogenous substrates of these mitochondria are more efficient in maintaining the Krebs cycle than are exogenous dicarboxylic acids. The quantitative nature of pyruvate metabolism by rabbit heart mitochondria is markedly altered following depletion of the endogenous substrates. These results indicate that the order of and the time interval between addition of reactants to mitochondrial systems may be important determinants of the nature of substrate metabolism and, hence, of respiratory rates and respiratory control ratios."
https://openalex.org/W1484532721,"Abstract In the presence of 0.1 µg per ml of actinomycin D, a concentration of drug that inhibits T4 progeny formation in Escherichia coli from 98 to g 99% but does not inhibit the synthesis of macromolecules, T4-infected cells fail to synthesize mature phage deoxyribonucleic acid leading to the accumulation of a DNA species that appears to be identical with replicating T4 DNA. The data suggest that the antibiotic acts by blocking the normal packaging of phage DNA within the head membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1556091360,"Abstract The relationship between light-induced absorbance changes and photophosphorylation has been studied in extracts of the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodospirillum rubrum purified by partition in dextran-methyl cellulose mixtures. In these preparations infrared light induces absorbance changes in the visible region of the spectrum which are modified by the addition of reductants required for photophosphorylation. The kinetics of photophosphorylation has been compared with light-induced absorbance changes, by measuring ATP formation in flashing light. With submaximal flash duration, the ultimate yield of ATP per flash parallels the absorbance change induced during the flash. The light-off absorbance change is characterized by a rapid phase and slower subsequent phase, or phases. The dark stage of photophosphorylation coincides with the rapid phase of the light-off absorbance change (the first 0.1 sec). The effects of potent inhibitors of photophosphorylation upon absorbance change kinetics are limited to the rapid phase of the light-off reaction. This phase is almost eliminated by antimycin A and other inhibitors of similar characteristics. It is significantly slowed by phenylmercuric acetate and by oligomycin. The carbonyl cyanide phenylhydrazones stimulate the rapid phase of the absorbance change, but only in the absence of adenosine diphosphate or in the presence of oligomycin. The rapid phase of the light-off reaction is also stimulated by adenosine diphosphate. These results suggest that the rapid phase of the light-off absorbance change may represent electron transport associated with phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2009112960,"Contrary to the results of transecting one half of the rostral pons, unilateral partial lesions of the rostral pons, involving either ""specific"" or ""aspecific"" structures, do not prevent the appearance of the desynchronized electroencephalographic patterns of deep sleep in the ipsilateral hemi sphere in cats. This effect, however, is obtained by lesions of the medial as well as lateral tegmental structures of the midbrain. These findings seem to indicate that (i) there is not a single pontine structure or group of structures of crucial importance for the EEG desynchronization of deep sleep; the whole rostral pons appears to contrib ute to the EEG-desynchronizing influ ence; (ii) this influence runs rostrally through the midbrain tegmentum, without following any known fiber pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2038898019,"The retention of orally administered zinc-65 was influenced by the previous diet. Zinc-deficient rabbits fed a diet containing 25 parts of zinc per million incorporated naturally in soybean protein still retained 58 percent of an oral dose of zinc-65 16 days after the dose was given, while rabbits fed the same diet supplemented with zinc (54 parts per million) as zinc oxide retained only 14 percent. The weight gain and the appearance of the animals fed these two diets were different."

https://openalex.org/W1562296762,"Abstract In the presence of tyrosinase, red blood cells are lysed. Lysis follows an enzyme-mediated reaction, with the amount of lysis being proportional to the tyrosinase concentration. Cyanide, which inhibits tyrosinase, prevents lysis of the red blood cells by tyrosinase. Heat-denatured tyrosinase has no effect on red blood cells. Tyrosinase also exhibits a pronounced effect on the permeability of isolated rat diaphragms. Glucose uptake is inhibited 28 to 44% whereas glycine uptake is stimulated 50% by tyrosinase. Ehrlich ascites cells, in the presence of tyrosinase, show decreased viability as measured by eosin dye uptake. These data strongly suggest that the tyrosyl residues of the protein layers of the cell membrane are involved in the maintenance of cell membrane integrity."
