https://openalex.org/W2001472611,"Anoxia occurs annually in deeper waters of the central portion of the Chesapeake Bay and presently extends from Baltimore to the mouth of the Potomac estuary. This condition, which encompasses some 5 billion cubic meters of water and lasts from May to September, is the result of increased stratification of the water column in early spring, with consequent curtailment of reoxygenation of the bottom waters across the halocline, and benthic decay of organic detritus accumulated from plankton blooms of the previous summer and fall. The Chesapeake Bay anoxia appears to have had significant ecological effects on many marine species, including several of economic importance."
https://openalex.org/W1982893769,"A reciprocal and apparently symmetrical interchange of land mammals between North and South America began about 3 million years ago, after the appearance of the Panamanian land bridge. The number of families of land mammals in South America rose from 32 before the interchange to 39 after it began, and then back to 35 at present. An equivalent number of families experienced a comparable rise and decline in North America during the same interval. These changes in diversity are predicted by the MacArthur-Wilson species equilibrium theory. The greater number of North American genera (24) initially entering South America than the reverse (12) is predicted by the proportions of reservoir genera on the two continents. However, a later imbalance caused by secondary immigrants (those which evolved from initial immigrants) is not expected from equilibrium theory."
https://openalex.org/W2068633942,"The instantaneous California Current is seen to consist of intense meandering current filaments (jets) intermingled with synoptic-mesoscale eddies. These quasi-geostrophic jets entrain cold, upwelled coastal waters and rapidly advect them far offshore; this behavior accounts for the elongated, cool surface features that are seen extending across the California Current region in satellite infrared imagery. The associated advective mechanism should provide significant cross-shore transports of heat, nutrients, biota, and pollutants. The dynamics of the current system should be crucially influenced by its highly variable structure."
https://openalex.org/W2064474762,"Toxins with unusual characteristics are involved in some destructive diseases of plants. Certain parasitic fungi produce toxins of low molecular weight that selectively affect the host plant; nonhosts are tolerant. These toxins have diverse structures, including cyclic peptides and linear polyketols. Genetic and other data show that resistance to each fungus is based on tolerance to its toxin. The same fungal genes control toxin production and ability to cause disease. Little is known about toxic action, although one toxin selectively affects mitochondria. Plant cell membranes are affected; this may allow the fungus to colonize tissues. Resistant cells may lack toxin receptor sites."
https://openalex.org/W2073774892,"The failure of interspecific and intergeneric crosses in the grasses is commonly due to zygotic inviability, embryo abortion, or endosperm abnormalities, all of which occur after fertilization. Often, however, there is difficulty in obtaining fertilization because the pollen tube fails to reach the embryo sac. This article concerns recent research on pollen-stigma interaction in the grasses and the light it is beginning to throw on prefertilization self- and cross-incompatibilities."
https://openalex.org/W1980265126,"Cesium iodide, a simple ionic salt at low pressures, undergoes a second-order transformation at 40 gigapascals (400 kilobars) from the cubic B2 (cesium chloride-type) structure to the body-centered tetragonal structure. Also, the energy gap between valence and conduction bands decreases from 6.4 electron volts at zero pressure to about 1.7 electron volts at 60 gigapascals, transforming cesium iodide from a highly ionic compound to a semiconductor. The structural transition increases the rate at which the band gap closes, and an extrapolation suggests that cesium iodide becomes metallic near (or somewhat above) 100 gigapascals. Similar changes in bonding character are likely to occur in other alkali halides at pressures above 100 gigapascals."
https://openalex.org/W2065847907,"A new gravitational lens system, the triple radio source MG2016+112, has been discovered. Five emission lines at a redshift of 3.2733+/-0.0014 have been identified in the spectra of two stellar objects of magnitude 22.5 coincident with radio components 3.4 arc seconds apart. The lines are the narrowest ever observed in objects at such a large redshift. The redshift of a 23rd-magnitude extended optical object coincident with the third radio component has not been determined spectroscopically, but its known optical properties are consistent with those of a giant elliptical galaxy with a redshift of about 0.8."
https://openalex.org/W2082093475,"Associations of carbonaceous material with iron-nickel alloy, carbides, and oxides were identified by analytical electron microscopy in ten unmelted chondritic porous micrometeorites from the earth's stratosphere. These associations, which may be interpreted in terms of reactions between a carbon-containing gas and catalytically active dust grains, suggest that some of the carbon in the chondritic porous subset of interplanetary dust was emplaced through heterogeneous catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W2031619776,"A pollen stratigraphy from late Miocene lacustrine strata (Teewinot Formation) in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, permits analysis of vegetation and climate history over a time interval of less than 300,000 years with better temporal resolution of data than has been reported from terrestrial Tertiary deposits. The flora was essentially modern, and six successive pollen assemblages indicate alternating dry and wet conditions. The frequency of climatic change in this record is similar to that inferred from marine isotope records for both late Tertiary and Quaternary time."

https://openalex.org/W1970208702,"Tax policy should be formulated with recognition of its effects on research and development and innovation. Many changes in tax policy designed to stimulate innovation have been proposed in recent years. Some of these changes were embodied in the 1981 tax bill. Basic economic analysis and rudimentary statistics enable economists to make some useful statements about the effects of recent and proposed tax changes but, because practically no studies have been conducted in this area, there is little or no dependable information concerning the quantitative impact of particular changes of this sort on the rate of innovation."
https://openalex.org/W2008826329,"In the past 25 years, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration has engaged in a range of cooperative activities in space with other countries and international organizations, most of the scientific interactions being with Europe. The character of U.S.-European cooperation in space science is changing as a result of the increased maturity and level of space capability which Europe is bringing to the partnership; the consequent addition of a competitive dimension to the relationship; the increasing cost of space science missions; and the relative scarcity of funds available for space science. A number of issues flow from the current situation, but in general the outlook is for continued productive cooperation between the United States and Europe in space science.."

https://openalex.org/W1981050695,"The Reagan Administration has proposed to relax or rescind the rule that since 1973 has limited the use of lead as cheap gasoline additive. Hearings on this proposal are scheduled for April 1-2, 1982 at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in Washington, DC. In making the proposal, EPA estimates that refiners may be able to save $200-300 million, but objections from environmental groups are expected to be considerable. This article briefly discusses the health effects associated with lead additives to gasoline, and outlines the controversy of the proposal. (JMT)"
