Biochemical and visual studies shown here demonstrate that the role of CD14 in signal transduction is to enhance LPS binding to MD-2, although its expression is not essential for cellular activation. These studies clarify how MD-2 functions: we found that MD-2 enables TLR4 binding to LPS and allows the formation of stable receptor complexes. MD-2 must be bound to TLR4 on the cell surface before binding can occur. Consequently, TLR4 clusters into receptosomes (many of which are massive) that recruit intracellular toll/IL-1/resistance domain-containing adapter proteins within minutes, thus initiating signal transduction. TLR4 activation correlates with the ability of MD-2 to bind LPS, as MD-2 mutants that still bind TLR4, but are impaired in the ability to bind LPS, conferred a greatly blunted LPS response. These findings help clarify the earliest events of TLR4 triggering by LPS and identify MD-2 as an attractive target for pharmacological intervention in endotoxin-mediated diseases.

Invasive Gram-negative infection is a life-threatening medical disorder that accounts for >300,000 cases of sepsis in the United States annually (1Angus D.C. Linde-Zwirble W.T. Lidicker J.

A milestone in understanding the molecular pathogenesis of this life-threatening condition was the discovery and characterization of germ line-encoded immune receptors known as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 1The abbreviations used are: TLRsToll-like receptorsLPSlipopolysaccharide(s)LBPlipopolysaccharide-binding proteinmAbmonoclonal antibodyGFPgreen fluorescent proteinPBSphosphate-buffered salineYFPyellow fluorescent proteinCFPcyan fluorescent proteinIL-8interleukin-8sCD14soluble CD14.1The abbreviations used are: TLRsToll-like receptorsLPSlipopolysaccharide(s)LBPlipopolysaccharide-binding proteinmAbmonoclonal antibodyGFPgreen fluorescent proteinPBSphosphate-buffered salineYFPyellow fluorescent proteinCFPcyan fluorescent proteinIL-8interleukin-8sCD14soluble CD14.

Following the recognition of their cognate ligands, TLRs initiate a complex signal transduction cascade that results in the production of a variety of immunologically active substances, including cytokines and vasoactive lipids (3Medzhitov R.

Activation of TLR4 by LPS is absolutely dependent upon the presence of MD-2 (12Schromm A.B. Lien E. Henneke P. Chow J.C. Yoshimura A. Heine H. Latz E. Monks B.G. Schwartz D.A. Miyake K.

In addition, sensitive responses to LPS depend on two additional proteins, lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) and CD14. Both of these molecules play a pivotal role in providing LPS to the signal transduction machinery (20Ingalls R.R. Heine H. Lien E. Yoshimura A. Golenbock D. Infect. Dis. Clin. North Am. 1999; 13: 341-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Using forward genetic screening, we identified an LPS non-responder cell line derived from CD14-transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells. These cells expressed a point mutation in MD-2 that resulted in the conversion of a conserved cysteine to tyrosine (12Schromm A.B. Lien E. Henneke P. Chow J.C. Yoshimura A. Heine H. Latz E. Monks B.G. Schwartz D.A. Miyake K. Golenbock D.T. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Human MD-2 bearing the same amino acid substitution was unable to confer LPS responsiveness to TLR4-expressing cells. These findings implied an absolute requirement for MD-2 in LPS receptor complex function. This conclusion has been confirmed both in vitro (e.g. Refs. 21Re F. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23427-23432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar and 22Kawasaki K. Nogawa H. Nishijima M. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and in vivo (13Nagai Y. Akashi S. Nagafuku M. Ogata M. Iwakura Y. Akira S. Kitamura T. Kosugi A. Kimoto M. Miyake K. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 667-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar), as animals with a targeted disruption of the MD-2 gene exhibit the same LPS non-responder phenotype. To gain insights into the mechanisms by which the LPS receptor complex activates cells, we analyzed the molecular basis for the impaired function of MD-2C95Y and found that it lacks both the ability to bind TLR4 on the cell surface and to interact with LPS. Based on the lipid-binding motifs of other LPS-interacting proteins (23Ferguson A.D. Welte W. Hofmann E. Lindner B. Holst O. Coulton J.W. Diederichs K. Struct. Fold Des. 2000; 8: 585-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 24Mancek M. Pristovsek P. Jerala R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 880-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 25Schumann R.R. Lamping N. Hoess A. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 5599-5605PubMed Google Scholar, 26Lamping N. Hoess A. Yu B. Park T.C. Kirschning C.J. Pfeil D. Reuter D. Wright S.D. Herrmann F. Schumann R.R. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4648-4656PubMed Google Scholar), we hypothesized that a highly positively charged region in human MD-2 (amino acids 122–132) might be involved in LPS recognition. Using targeted point mutagenesis, we discovered that lysines 128 and 132 are critical for binding to LPS, but not to TLR4. As no previous work had demonstrated how CD14 and LBP relate to MD-2, we sought to characterize this interaction. We found that MD-2 binding to LPS is greatly enhanced by both CD14 and LBP, thus explaining their LPS-sensitizing effect. In addition, we found evidence that TLR4 and LPS physically interact, consistent with a previous study from our group concerning the pharmacology of TLR4 and lipid A (27Golenbock D.T. Hampton R.Y. Qureshi N. Takayama K. Raetz C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19490-19498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The formation of these stable complexes requires the presence of MD-2. The functional outcome of this interaction is the formation of surface aggregates of TLR4 that can be visually observed on the cell surface following LPS binding to TLR4 on transfected HEK293 cells. We found that the resultant cytoplasmic surface formed by this cluster rapidly recruits toll/IL-1/resistance domain-containing adapter molecules via homophilic interactions and propagates the activation signal to downstream effectors, culminating in the activation of NF-κB-dependent gene expression. We propose that the induction of large aggregates of TLR4 promoted by MD-2 is the critical event that initiates LPS signal transduction. HEK293 cell lines stably expressing fluorescent protein-tagged TLR4 have been described previously (19Latz E. Visintin A. Lien E. Fitzgerald K.A. Monks B.G. Kurt-Jones E.A. Golenbock D.T. Espevik T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47834-47843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells stably expressing MD-2 or MD-2C95Y were generated by retroviral transduction (18Visintin A. Mazzoni A. Spitzer J.A. Segal D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12156-12161Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli 0111:B4 LPS was purchased from Sigma and repurified to remove contaminating TLR2 ligands as described (28Hirschfeld M. Ma Y. Weis J.H. Vogel S.N. Weis J.J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibody (mAb) HTA125 (IgG2a), which recognizes TLR4, was a gift from Dr. Kensuke Miyake (29Shimazu R. Akashi S. Ogata H. Nagai Y. Fukudome K. Miyake K. Kimoto M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1777-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (1717) Google Scholar). The mAb and polyclonal antiserum against green fluorescent protein (GFP) were from Clontech and Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR), respectively. The horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-biotin polyclonal antibody was from New England Biolabs Inc. (Beverly, MA). Unless otherwise stated, all other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Adherent cells from a confluent 10-cm dish were labeled with biotin (Pierce) on ice, solubilized in detergent (1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors), subjected to immunoprecipitation with the indicated antibodies (2 μg/ml) in 20 μl of packed protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) for 16 h at 4 °C, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and electrotransferred onto Hybond-C nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were blocked in 5% dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and 0.1% Tween 20 for 30 min at 37 °C and probed for an additional 30 min at 37 °C with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-biotin polyclonal antibody (1 μg/ml). Biotinylated proteins were revealed by enhanced chemiluminescence using a commercial kit for this purpose (Amersham Biosciences). Identical conditions for immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were used for all of the blots presented in this work. FLAG-tagged MD-2 was revealed by probing the membranes with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated mAb M2, whereas GFP-tagged TLR4 was detected by blotting with anti-GFP mAb, followed by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary reagent (Bio-Rad). When necessary, membranes were stripped for 30 min in 0.1 m glycine (pH 2.2), 1% Tween 20, and 0.1% SDS and reprobed. The polysaccharide moiety of repurified LPS was biotin-labeled using biotin hydrazide (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 1 mg of LPS was treated with 10 mm of sodium metaperiodate on ice for 30 min in coupling buffer (0.1 m sodium acetate at pH 5.5). After quenching in 50 mm glycerol for 5 min, excess oxidant and glycerol were removed by gel filtration using a Sephadex G-25 PD-10 desalting column (Amersham Biosciences), and LPS was eluted in coupling buffer. Biotinylation was performed by adding biotin hydrazide to a 5 mm final concentration for 2 h at room temperature. Unreacted biotin hydrazide was removed by a second purification step with a PD-10 column, and biotinylated LPS was finally eluted in Hanks' balanced saline solution. Biotinyated LPS was subjected to SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blotting using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-biotin polyclonal antibody (see above), which revealed a smeared band ranging from 100 to 20 kDa, as would have been predicted because of the heterogeneous nature of the polysaccharide portion of LPS and the likelihood that the number of biotins per LPS would not be constant (30Raetz C.R. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3222) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the bioactivity of the LPS was retained as assessed by comparing the ability of non-biotinylated LPS with that of biotinylated LPS in an NF-κB activation assay of TLR4-expressing HEK293 cells. The binding of LPS to FLAG-tagged soluble MD-2 was examined by incubating 10 ml of supernatant from HEK293 cells that had been transfected with MD-2 with 0.5–1 μg of biotinylated LPS/ml either overnight at 4 °C or for 1 h at room temperature in the presence of 25 μl of packed streptavidin-Sepharose CL-4B. Beads were collected by centrifugation, washed three times with Hanks' balanced saline solution, and resuspended in reducing SDS sample buffer, and anti-FLAG Western analysis was performed as described above. Washing with lysis buffer did not dissociate MD-2·LPS complexes. To study LPS interactions with TLR4, adherent cells from 10-cm confluent dishes were washed extensively with PBS and incubated for 30 min with 5 ml of prewarmed complete medium containing 1 μg/ml biotinylated LPS. Cells were then washed with Hanks' balanced saline solution and lysed as described above for immunoprecipitations. Biotinylated LPS·protein complexes were collected by addition of 20 μl of packed streptavidin beads and processed exactly as described for the immunoprecipitation protocol. The presence of TLR4 in the LPS complexes was assessed by Western blotting with anti-GFP antibody (which also recognizes the spectral variants of GFP such as yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) and cyan fluorescent protein (CFP)). Confocal Microscopy—To visualize the surface distribution of TLR4 and MD-2, HEK293 cells stably expressing YFP-TLR4 were seeded on 35-mm glass-bottom tissue culture dishes (Mattek Corp., Ashland, MA) and transfected with MD-2 or MD-2C95Y using GeneJuice (Novagen, La Jolla, CA). The following day, cells were washed twice with PBS supplemented with 1% fetal bovine serum and incubated for 30 min on ice with mouse anti-FLAG mAb M2 (10 μg/ml). After two washes with PBS/fetal bovine serum, the cells were incubated with Alexa 647-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (2 μg/ml) for 15 min on ice. Confocal images were collected from living cells incubated on a warm-stage apparatus at 37 °C for 15 min with a Zeiss Axiovert 100-M inverted microscope using an LSM 510 laser scanning unit. YFP was excited using the 514-nm line of a 25-milliwatt argon laser, and Alexa 647 was excited with a helium/neon laser emitting at 633 nm. Band-pass or long-pass filters were chosen to optimally separate the fluorescence emissions between the different photomultipliers using single-labeled samples of the probes as controls. LPS-induced clustering of TLR4 and MyD88 recruitment was monitored as follows. HEK293 cells stably expressing YFP-TLR4 and MD-2 or YFP-TLR4 and MD-2C95Y were grown on glass-bottom tissue culture dishes and transiently transfected with CFP-tagged MyD88. The cells were then incubated with 250 ng of Cy5-labeled repurified E. coli 0111:B4 LPS/ml of culture medium. After 10 min, the cells were washed twice with prewarmed culture medium and imaged with a Zeiss confocal microscope using a warm-stage apparatus set at 37 °C. Sequential scans were taken for CFP, YFP, and Cy5 using excitation at 458, 514, and 633 nm, respectively. z-stacks were acquired by scanning the cells from top to bottom. Side views of the cells were generated by electronically overlaying the images in the xy axis and visualizing the z axis. Scanning Electron Microscopy—Cells were grown on poly-l-lysine-treated coverslips and treated with 1 μg/ml LPS for 5 min at 37 °C. Samples were chilled on ice, washed with ice-cold Hanks' balanced saline solution, fixed for 20 min in 4% glutaraldehyde, and stained for 30 min with mAb HTA125 (1 μg/sample) in 200 μl. Antigen·antibody complexes were revealed by a 30-min incubation with a Nanogold™-labeled anti-mouse F(ab′)2 polyclonal antibody, followed by silver enhancement (LIS silver enhancement kit, L-24919, Molecular Probes, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The silver-enhanced coverslips were then washed twice for 5 min with ultrapure water, dehydrated through a graded series of ethanol soaks to 100%, and then critical point-dried in liquid CO2 (31Robards A.W. Wilson A.J. Procedures in Electron Microscopy, Current Core Edition & Updates. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999Google Scholar). The coverslips with the dried cells were mounted and gold-coated for scanning electron microscopy. Samples were examined on an Etec Autoscan electron microscope at 20 kV. Atomic contrast imaging was performed on the samples' backscatter to confirm the silver nature of the white particles. TLR4-induced cell signal transduction was monitored by measuring either NF-κB activity or interleukin-8 (IL-8) secretion. To measure NF-κB activation, 2 μg of a reporter plasmid in which NF-κB drives the synthesis of luciferase was transiently cotransfected with 5 μg of the indicated cDNA by lipofection (GeneJuice) in 10-cm tissue culture dishes following the manufacturer's recommendations. The following morning, cells were seeded at a density of 50,000 cells/well in a 96-well plate, allowed to recover for 5 h, and stimulated as indicated between 6 and 18 h. Luciferase activity was measured with a plate reader luminometer (Victor2, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using chemicals provided with the luciferase assay system (Promega, Madison, WI). All data are presented as the means ± S.D. of triplicate well readings, normalized to a value of 1.0 in comparison with an unstimulated negative control. Antibody cross-linking experiments were performed by coating the 96-well high protein-binding tissue culture plates (catalog no. 3361, Costar, Corning, NY) overnight with 50 μl of mAbs (or LPS) in PBS at the indicated concentrations. Excess antibody was removed by washing the plates with pyrogen-free PBS, and cells transfected with the NF-κB-luciferase reporter plasmid were seeded. At 6–18 h post-seeding, NF-κB activation was assessed as described above, and IL-8 levels in the supernatants were measured using a commercial IL-8 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) following the manufacturer's recommendation. As a negative control, antibodies were boiled for 10 min before coating the plates. TLR4 and MD-2 Form Noncovalently Bound Complexes on the Cell Surface of HEK293 Cells—Substitution of cysteine 95 with a tyrosine residue generates a mutant form of human MD-2 (MD-2C95Y) that binds to TLR4 in the cytoplasm and partially immunoprecipitates with TLR4 (12Schromm A.B. Lien E. Henneke P. Chow J.C. Yoshimura A. Heine H. Latz E. Monks B.G. Schwartz D.A. Miyake K. Golenbock D.T. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). MD-2C95Y is unable to confer LPS responsiveness to TLR4 (12Schromm A.B. Lien E. Henneke P. Chow J.C. Yoshimura A. Heine H. Latz E. Monks B.G. Schwartz D.A. Miyake K. Golenbock D.T. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). However, substituting cysteine 95 with a serine residue, which is sterically closer to a cysteine, generates a mutant form of MD-2 (MD-2C95S) that has been shown to be slightly active when cotransfected with TLR4 (32Mullen G.E. Kennedy M.N. Visintin A. Mazzoni A. Leifer C.A. Davies D.R. Segal D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3919-3924Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the failure of MD-2C95Y to enable LPS signaling was due to its failure to properly bind to surface TLR4. Cells stably expressing YFP-tagged TLR4 were transfected with FLAG-tagged MD-2, MD-2C95Y, or MD-1. Cell-surface proteins were biotin-labeled, and whole cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-GFP polyclonal antiserum, which recognizes epitopetagged TLR4. Anti-GFP precipitates were resolved by electrophoresis, blotted, and probed for surface biotin (Fig. 1). The same lysates were also precipitated with anti-FLAG mAb, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose. Because of size differences in the proteins of interest, this blot was then bisected, and each portion was developed individually by Western blotting using anti-FLAG antibody for the lower portion or anti-GFP antibody for the upper portion of the blot. We found that TLR4 and MD-2 co-immunoprecipitated from the cell surface (Fig. 1, lane 1). In contrast, neither the MD-2C95Y mutant protein nor MD-1 associated with TLR4 on the cell surface (Fig. 1, lanes 2 and 3), despite comparable levels of these proteins in the lysates (lanes 4–9). MD-2C95Y Does Not Co-localize with TLR4 on the Cell Surface—Western blot analysis of transfected HEK293 cells and their supernatants established that MD-2C95Y is synthesized, glycosylated, and secreted (data not shown). HEK293 cells stably expressing YFP-tagged TLR4 were transiently transfected with MD-2 (Fig. 2, upper panels) or the MD-2C95Y mutant (lower panels) and stained with anti-FLAG mAb. MD-2 was then cross-linked and visualized by incubating these cells at 37 °C with Alexa 647-conjugated anti-mouse IgG polyclonal antibody. Confocal microscopic scans of YFP fluorescence (TLR4) and Alexa 647 fluorescence (MD-2) were obtained. In the absence of antibody treatment, TLR4 is uniformly distributed on the cell surface, as well as in the Golgi apparatus (19Latz E. Visintin A. Lien E. Fitzgerald K.A. Monks B.G. Kurt-Jones E.A. Golenbock D.T. Espevik T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47834-47843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Additionally, quantitative analysis of TLR4 by flow cytometry demonstrated that, in transfected HEK293 cells, the level of TLR4 surface expression was independent of MD-2 or MD-2C95Y coexpression (data not shown). Treatment of wild-type MD-2 with anti-FLAG antibody resulted in the clustering of MD-2 on the cell surface. Because MD-2 is bound to TLR4 on the cell surface, we subsequently observed the reorganization of surface TLR4 in the exact same distribution as MD-2 (yellow signal). Surprisingly, although our immunoprecipitation analysis suggested that MD-2C95Y would not bind TLR4 (and it is not known to bind any other TLR), it was consistently found on the surface of HEK293 cells that had been transfected with the TLR4 and MD-2C95Y cDNAs. Antibody cross-linking aggregated the mutant form of MD-2, but no commensurate changes in the distribution of TLR4 were observed (Fig. 2, lower panels). These results indicate that the MD-2C95Y mutant is not capable of binding to TLR4. Antibody-mediated Aggregation of MD-2 Efficiently Triggers TLR4 —The co-localization of TLR4 with MD-2 correlates with LPS responsiveness and thus suggests that binding of MD-2 to TLR4 is required for the assembly of an active LPS receptor. It is reasonable to postulate that the MD-2C95Y mutant failed to function because of its inability to mediate the assembly of a signaling complex. If the assembly of a heteromeric complex were truly the initiating event in signal transduction, then cross-linking TLR4 and/or MD-2 with antibodies instead of a ligand should mimic receptor activation. To directly test this hypothesis, we coated the surface of plastic dishes with mAbs and plated transfected cells on the antibody-coated surface. mAb HTA125 (29Shimazu R. Akashi S. Ogata H. Nagai Y. Fukudome K. Miyake K. Kimoto M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1777-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (1717) Google Scholar) recognizes TLR4, and anti-FLAG mAb M2 binds the epitope tag on MD-2 and MD-2C95Y. As shown in Fig. 3, anti-FLAG mAb stimulated IL-8 secretion when wild-type MD-2 was present, but not when the MD-2C95Y mutant was expressed. This indicates that TLR4 is present on the cell surface despite the presence of a mutant form of MD-2 (because the plated antibody can bind only to surface TLR4). Identical antibody-induced activation was obtained in cells that did not express any exogenous MD-2 (data not shown). Isotype-matched antibodies and boiled antibodies did not activate cells (see Fig. 5) (data not shown), indicating that activation was not caused by contaminating LPS. We conclude that aggregation is an effective triggering signal for TLR4-mediated cellular activation. The MD-2C95Y mutant is incapable of activating TLR4 when cross-linked with a mAb because it fails to co-aggregate TLR4.Fig. 5MD-2 has a TLR4-binding domain and a second positively charged domain that is necessary for full activation.A, shown is an alignment of a highly basic region of MD-2 orthologs. The asterisks indicate the lysine residues in human MD-2; the lysine residues that were used to prepare mutant MD-2 molecules (MD-2K128E and MD-2K132E) are shown in boldface. B, HEK293 cells stably expressing YFP-TLR4 were transiently transfected with wild-type MD-2 (MD-2wt) or mutant MD-2 constructs and an NF-κB/luciferase reporter plasmid. TLR4 and MD-2 were immunoprecipitated (IP) from cell lysates or supernatants using anti-GFP or anti-FLAG antibody as indicated. Immunoprecipitates were resolved by 4–15% reducing SDS-PAGE, transferred to a Hybond membrane, bisected with a razor, and probed individually for TLR4 or MD-2"

It is well established that RA functions by activating retinoic acid receptors (RARs), which, in turn, control cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. However, perplexing reports of diverse and sometime opposing actions of RA have been published. Hence, while RA induces apoptosis and inhibits cell growth in some settings, it potentiates proliferation and acts as an anti-apoptotic agent in others. These observations raise the possibility that signaling pathways other than RAR may be involved in mediating RA activities. Here we show that RA is a high affinity ligand for another nuclear receptor, namely the orphan receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) β/δ. We demonstrate that while RA does not activate PPARα and PPARγ, it binds to PPARβ/δ with nanomolar affinity, modulates the conformation of the receptor, promotes interaction with the coactivator SRC-1, and efficiently activates PPARβ/δ-mediated transcription. Transcriptional signaling by RA is thus exerted by a dual pathway, providing a rationale for understanding divergent cellular responses to this hormone.

Consequently, RA plays key roles in embryonal development (3Ross S.A. McCaffery P.J. Drager U.C. De Luca L.M. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1021-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar, 4Rohwedel J. Guan K. Wobus A.M. Cells Tissues Organs. 1999; 165: 190-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) and is also used as a therapeutic agent in a number of pathologies including several cancers (5Lotan R. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1031-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 6Miller Jr., W.H. Cancer. 1998; 83: 1471-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). It is well established that the pleiotropic activities of RA are mediated by members of the superfamily of nuclear hormone receptors known as retinoic acid receptors (RARs), which upon activation modulate the rates of transcription of numerous target genes. Like other class 2 nuclear receptors, RARs function as heterodimers with retinoid X receptors (RXRs). These heterodimers bind to specific response elements in the promoter regions of target genes and function as ligand-inducible transcription factors (1Chambon P. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 940-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2606) Google Scholar, 7Mangelsdorf D. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Sporn M.B., Roberts, A.B., and Goodman, D.S.

For example, while this hormone induces apoptosis and inhibits cell growth in some settings (8Breitman T.R. Collins S.J. Keene B.R. Blood. 1981; 57: 1000-1004Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Raffo P.

These observations raise the possibility that signaling pathways other than RAR may be involved in mediating RA activities. In search for a mechanism that may underlie these inconsistencies, we considered the orphan nuclear receptor PPARβ/δ, for which no physiological ligand has been reported. The biological functions of PPARβ/δ are not as well understood as those of its PPARα and PPARγ isotypes. It was, however, recently demonstrated that PPARβ/δ mediates differentiation in keratinocytes and oligodendrocytes (15Tan N.S. Michalik L. Noy N. Yasmin R. Pacot C. Heim M. Fluhmann B. Desvergne B. Wahli W. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3263-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 16Saluja I. Granneman J.G. Skoff R.P. Glia. 2001; 33: 191-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). It was also shown that by up-regulating the expression of antiapoptotic genes and down-regulating the expression of proapoptotic genes, PPARβ/δ significantly increases cell resistance to apoptosis (15Tan N.S. Michalik L. Noy N. Yasmin R. Pacot C. Heim M. Fluhmann B. Desvergne B. Wahli W. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3263-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 17Di-Poi N. Tan N.S. Michalik L. Wahli W.

We show that RA is a high affinity ligand for PPARβ/δ. We demonstrate that while RA does not activate PPARα and PPARγ, it binds to PPARβ/δ with nanomolar affinity, modulates the conformation of the receptor, promotes interaction with the coactivator SRC-1, and efficiently activates PPARβ/δ-mediated transcription. These observations suggest that transcriptional signaling by RA is exerted by a dual pathway, which, in turn, may lead to divergent cellular responses.

Fluorescence Titrations—Bacterially expressed mPPARα-LBD, mPPARβ/δ-LBD, and mPPARγ-LBD (0.2–1 μm) were titrated directly in a cuvette with RA dissolved in ethanol. Ethanol concentration was usually below 1% and never exceeded 2%. To ensure equilibration between protein and ligand, the fluorescence was monitored until a constant value was reached. The progress of titrations was monitored by following the decrease in the intrinsic fluorescence of the protein (excitation, 280 nm; emission, 340 nm), which accompanies RA binding. Inner filtering by the ligand, reflected by linear slopes observed following saturation of the protein, was corrected for as described (20Cogan U. Kopelman M. Mokady S. Shinitzky M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 65: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Corrected data were analyzed to obtain equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd). Analyses were carried out by fitting the data to equation (1Chambon P. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 940-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2606) Google Scholar) derived from simple binding theory (23Norris A.W.

In Vitro Transcription/Translation— 35S-Labeled PPARβ/δ and SRC-1 were synthesized using the TNT-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega). Proteolysis Assay— 35S-Labeled PPARβ/δ (2 μl) was incubated for 20 min at 25 °C in a total volume of 8 μl of 22 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 75 mm KCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, and 2 mm dithioerythritol in the presence of vehicle or ligand (10 μm). Protein was digested with chymotrypsin (25 °C, 20 min), resolved by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography. “Pull-down” Assays—GST-PPARβ/δ-LBD was immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithioerythritol, 0.1% (v/v), Igepal CA-630, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 5% (w/v) fatty acid-free milk powder. ∼5 μg of protein was mixed with 8 μl of 35S-labeled in vitro transcribed/translated SRC-1. Mixtures were incubated for2hat4 °C. Beads were washed three times in 1 ml of buffer without milk powder, and bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. Band intensities were quantitated using the Cyclone phosphorimager system (Packard Bioscience). Transactivation Assays—COS-7 cells were maintained with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% charcoal-treated newborn calf serum. Cells were transfected using FuGENE (Roche Diagnostics) with a (PPRE)3-luciferase reporter (0.3 μg/well), expression vectors for receptors (0.3 μg/well), and pCH110 (0.2 μg/well). Medium was replaced with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 24 h. Cells were treated with denoted ligands for 24 h and lysed. Lysates were analyzed for reporter activity and normalized for β-galactosidase. Binding of RA to PPARα, PPARβ/δ, and PPARγ was studied by fluorescence titrations. This method relies on the considerable overlap of the absorption spectrum of RA with the fluorescence emission spectra of tryptophanes and tyrosines, a consequence of which is that RA-binding results in quenching of the intrinsic fluorescence of a binding protein (20Cogan U. Kopelman M. Mokady S. Shinitzky M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 65: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 21Kersten S. Pan L. Noy N.

PPARs were titrated with RA and the ligand-induced decrease in protein fluorescence was monitored (Fig. 1). Titration curves were corrected for inner filtering and fitted to a simple binding equation (23Norris A.W. Cheng L. Giguere V. Rosenberger M. Li E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1209: 10-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) to obtain equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd , Table I). RA bound to PPARα and PPARγ with a low affinity demonstrated by Kd values of 100–200 nm. In contrast, RA associated with PPARβ/δ with a Kd of 17 nm, revealing both high affinity and isotype selectivity. The measured affinity of PPARβ/δ for RA is thus comparable with that of various PPAR ligands for these receptors (24Lin Q. Ruuska S.E. Shaw N.S. Dong D. Noy N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) and with that of the synthetic PPARβ/δ-selective ligand L165041 (25Tan N.S. Shaw N.S. Vinckenbosch N. Liu P. Yasmin R.

O'Malley B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19513-19520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protease sensitivity assays were carried out to compare the effects of RA to those of the synthetic PPARβ/δ-selective agonist L165041 (Fig. 2). As shown previously (28Jorgensen C. Krogsdam A.M. Kratchmarova I. Willson T.M. Knudsen J. Mandrup S. Kristiansen K. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2002; 967: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), addition of L165041 decreased the sensitivity of the receptor to chymotrypsin digestion and resulted in preservation of protease-resistant fragments (denoted by lines on the right in Fig. 2). RA also increased the resistance of the receptor to proteolysis but gave rise to a different pattern of protected fragments. It was reported previously that different PPAR agonists may give rise to differential protection profiles (29Dowell P. Peterson V.J. Zabriskie T.M. Leid M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2013-2020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the observations in Fig. 2, showing differences between the effects of RA and L165041, raise the question whether RA is a bona fide PPARβ/δ agonist. The hallmark of active nuclear receptor ligands is that they enable the recruitment of transcriptional coactivators (30Westin S. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Adv. Pharmacol. 2000; 47: 89-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The ability of RA to promote association of PPARβ/δ with the coactivator SRC-1 was thus investigated by GST-pull-down assays (Fig. 3). Similarly to L165041, the interactions of SRC-1 with PPARβ/δ were significantly stabilized in the presence of RA but not upon addition of the RAR-selective ligand TTNPB (Fig. 3a). Moreover, RA-induced enhancement of SRC-1 binding by the receptor occurred in dose-depended fashion (Fig. 3, b and c). The ability of RA to enhance the transcriptional activity of PPARα, PPARβ/δ, and PPARγ was then directly examined by transactivation assays. In these, a luciferase reporter driven by a consensus PPAR response element (PPRE) was utilized. Cells were cotransfected with the reporter construct together with expression vectors for each of the PPAR isotypes, and the effect of RA treatment of reporter expression was studied. RA did not activate PPARγ and poorly activated PPARα. In contrast, RA efficiently enhanced the transcriptional activity of PPARβ/δ (Fig. 4), displaying an EC50 for this subtype that was an order of magnitude lower than that observed for PPARα (Fig. 4a). Control experiments showed that all three PPAR isotypes were similarly activated in these cells by synthetic isotype-selective ligands, verifying that the inability of RA to activate PPARα and PPARγ did not stem from poor expression of these isotypes (Fig. 4b). The data thus demonstrated that RA is a potent and selective activator of PPARβ/δ. The transcriptional activities of PPARs are mediated by their heterodimers with RXR (31Desvergne B. Wahli W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 649-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (2746) Google Scholar). Both PPAR-RXR heterodimers and RXR homodimers bind to similar response elements comprised of two repeats separated by a single base pair (DR-1). In either complex, RXR can be activated by 9-cis-RA. It can thus be argued that RA may have been converted to an RXR ligand within the cells and that its transcriptional activity reflected activation of RXR rather than PPARβ/δ. While the observations that RA selectively activated PPARβ/δ renders this possibility unlikely, we examined it directly. An RXR construct lacking its AF-2 domain (RXRΔH12) was used. RXRΔH12 can heterodimerize with PPAR (32Gampe Jr., R.T. Montana V.G. Lambert M.H. Miller A.B. Bledsoe R.K. Milburn M.V. Kliewer S.A. Willson T.M. Xu H.E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 545-555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar) and properly associate with cognate DNA (33Zhao Q. Chasse S.A. Devarakonda S. Sierk M.L. Ahvazi B. Rastinejad F. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 509-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), but it cannot activate transcription on its own. Consequently, PPAR-RXRΔH12 dimers do not respond to RXR ligands but can be activated by PPAR agonists (albeit at a somewhat lower efficiency than in the presence of WT-RXR). Cells were cotransfected with expression vectors for RXRΔH12 and PPARβ/δ, and the ability of RA to activate the PPRE-reporter was studied (Fig. 4c). As expected, the RXR-selective agonist LG268 was ineffective. In contrast, both the PPARβ/δ ligand L165041 and RA activated the reporter, demonstrating that RA acts in these assays through PPARβ/δ and not via RXR. Note as well that the observed reporter activity was not mediated by RAR, which does not function through the PPRE used in these assays (Fig. 4d). These observations lead to the surprising conclusion that in addition to activating RAR, RA is a potent and selective ligand for the orphan receptor PPARβ/δ. The biological functions of PPARβ/δ have only began to be elucidated as it was recently reported that this receptor mediates differentiation in keratinocytes and oligodendrocytes (15Tan N.S. Michalik L. Noy N. Yasmin R. Pacot C. Heim M. Fluhmann B. Desvergne B. Wahli W. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3263-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 16Saluja I. Granneman J.G. Skoff R.P. Glia. 2001; 33: 191-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). It was also demonstrated that expression and activation of PPARβ/δ increases cell resistance to apoptosis (15Tan N.S. Michalik L. Noy N. Yasmin R. Pacot C. Heim M. Fluhmann B. Desvergne B. Wahli W. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3263-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). This activity was traced to PPARβ/δ-mediated transcriptional up-regulation of the expression of ILK and PDK1, leading to activation of the anti-apoptotic Akt1 signaling pathway (17Di-Poi N. Tan N.S. Michalik L. Wahli W. Desvergne B. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 721-733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The current use of RA as a chemotherapeutic agent in several cancers is based on the pronounced growth inhibitory activities of this hormone, which are believed to be mediated by RARs. It was reported that in various carcinomas, RA induces apoptosis (34Seewaldt V.L. Johnson B.S. Parker M.B. Collins S.J. Swisshelm K.

Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3163-3172PubMed Google Scholar), and that in some cells, and it inhibits proliferation by a combination of effects (37Wightman J. Roberson M.S. Lamkin T.J. Varvayanis S. Yen A.

However, it has also been reported that in some settings, RA treatment may result in enhanced proliferation (11Ahlemeyer B. Huhne R. Krieglstein J. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 60: 767-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 12Kitamura M. Ishikawa Y. Moreno-Manzano V. Xu Q. Konta T. Lucio-Cazana J. Furusu A. Nakayama K. Nephrol. Dial.

Terakawa N. Aono T. Tanizawa O. Matsumoto K. Endocrinology. 1986; 118: 1530-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). For example, it was shown that RA potentates epidermal growth factor-induced proliferation in cultured explants of mouse mammary gland (14Komura H. Wakimoto H. Chen C.F. Terakawa N. Aono T. Tanizawa O. Matsumoto K. Endocrinology. 1986; 118: 1530-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), inhibits lobuloalveolar differentiation of cultured mouse mammary glands (13Kistler A. Carcinogenesis. 1986; 7: 1175-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and promotes at late stages of malignant progression in some cell variants in breast cancer tumors (39Sapi E. Flick M.B. Tartaro K. Kim S. Rakhlin Y. Rodov S. Kacinski B.M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5578-5585PubMed Google Scholar). The basis for the opposing activities of RA on cell growth is unknown at present. However, an intriguing possibility suggested by our observations is that while RA exerts growth inhibition through activating RAR, it may evoke anti-apoptotic activities, and thus promote growth via activation of PPARβ/δ. An important question in regard to this possibility is how the partitioning of RA between its dual transcriptional signaling may be regulated.

In addition, through purification of MRGBP and its associated proteins from HeLa cell nuclear extracts, we identify the thyroid receptor coactivating protein (TRCp120), DMAP1, and the related MRG15 and MRGX proteins as MRGBP-associating proteins, and we present biochemical evidence that they are previously unrecognized components of the TRRAP/TIP60 HAT complex.

In this report, we identify a previously uncharacterized protein encoded by the FLJ10914 ORF, which we designate MRGBP, as a new component of the TRRAP/TIP60 HAT complex. In addition, through purification of MRGBP and its associated proteins from HeLa cell nuclear extracts, we identify the thyroid receptor coactivating protein (TRCp120), DMAP1, and the related MRG15 and MRGX proteins as MRGBP-associating proteins, and we present biochemical evidence that they are previously unrecognized components of the TRRAP/TIP60 HAT complex. Taken together, our findings shed new light on the structure and function of the mammalian TRRAP/TIP60 histone acetyltransferase complex.

To date, the best characterized TRRAP-containing HAT is the Saccharomyces cerevisiae SAGA complex (1Grant P.A. Sterner D.E. Duggan L.J. Workman J.L. Berger S.L.

The SAGA complex includes the yeast TRRAP homolog Tra1, the Ada1, Ada2, and Ada3 proteins, the Spt3, Spt7, Spt8, and Spt20 proteins, several TAFs including TAF5, TAF6, TAF9, TAF10, and TAF12, and Gcn5, the founding member of the Gcn5-related N-acetyltransferase (GNAT) superfamily of HATs. In contrast to yeast, mammalian cells contain multiple TRRAP-containing SAGA-like HATs including the STAGA (SPT3-TAF(II)31-Gcn5-L acetyltransferase), PCAF (p300/CBP-associated factor), and TFTC (TATA-binding protein-free TAF(II) complex) complexes. These GNAT HATs have overlapping but non-identical subunit compositions. The STAGA complex includes TRRAP, mammalian homologs of the yeast Ada1 (STAF42), Ada2, and Ada3 proteins, mammalian homologs of the yeast Spt3 and Spt7 proteins, TAF9 and TAF12, PAF65α, and PAF65β, which are similar to TAF6 and TAF5, respectively, the splicing factor SAP130, the UV-damaged DNA-binding protein DDB1, and a mammalian homolog of the yeast Gcn5 HAT referred to as Gcn5L (4Martinez E.

Finally, the TFTC complex includes TRRAP, the mammalian Ada2 and Spt3 proteins, TAF2, TAF4, TAF5, TAF6, TAF7, TAF9, TAF10, and TAF12, the PAF65α and PAF65β proteins, SAP130, and Gcn5 (7Wieczorek E.

In addition to its role as a subunit of the S. cerevisiae SAGA and mammalian SAGA-like complexes, the TRRAP protein is also a component of a structurally unrelated HAT referred to in yeast as the NuA4 complex. The S. cerevisiae NuA4 complex includes TRRAP homolog Tra1, the Enhancer of Polycomb protein, the chromodomain protein Eaf3, p33ING1 tumor suppressor homolog Yng2, actin-like protein Arp4, actin, and Esa1, a HAT belonging to the MYST family (10Allard S.

A multiprotein NuA4-like HAT has also been identified in mammalian cells and, like the yeast NuA4 complex, was found to include TRRAP, the Enhancer of Polycomb protein, actin-like protein BAF53a, which is a homolog of yeast Arp4, actin, and TIP60, an Esa1-related HAT belonging to the MYST family. In addition to these homologs of known yeast NuA4 subunits, the mammalian Nua4-like HAT includes the SNF2-related helicase p400 and the AAA ATPases TIP49a and TIP49b (14Ikura T. Ogryzko V.

In this report, we identify a previously uncharacterized protein encoded by the FLJ10914 ORF as a new component of the TRRAP/TIP60 HAT complex. In addition, through purification of FLJ10914 and its associating proteins from HeLa cell nuclear extracts, we identify the thyroid receptor-coactivating protein (TRCp120), DMAP1, and the related MRG15 and MRGX proteins as FLJ10914-interacting proteins, and we present biochemical evidence that these proteins are previously unrecognized components of the TRRAP/TIP60 HAT complex. Materials—Anti-FLAG-agarose, anti-FLAG (M2) monoclonal anti-bodies, and anti-FLAG peptide were purchased from Sigma. Anti-TRRAP (T-17) antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-TIP60 antibodies were from Upstate-Cell Signaling Solutions. Anti-DMAP1 antibodies were purchased from Affinity BioReagents. Anti-MRGBP rabbit polyclonal antibodies were raised against the full-length bacterially expressed MRGBP protein (Cocalico Biologicals, Inc.) Mass Spectrometry—Proteins were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins in gel slices were subjected to in-gel reduction, S-carboxyamidomethylation, and tryptic digestion. Peptide sequences were determined in a single run by microcapillary reversed-phase HPLC coupled to the nanospray ionization source of a quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer (Finnigan LCQ, San Jose, CA). Identification of proteins present in gel slices was facilitated by the algorithm SEQUEST. We previously reported partial purification from rat liver nuclear extracts of a multiprotein Med8-containing Mediator complex with an apparent native molecular mass of more than 1000 kDa (15Brower C.S. Sato S. Tomomori-Sato C. Kamura T. Pause A. Stearman R. Klausner R.D. Malik S. Lane W.S. Sorokina I. Roeder R.G. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10353-10358Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Analysis of proteins present in the most highly enriched Med8-containing Mediator fractions by tandem mass spectrometry led to the identification of many known mammalian Mediator subunits, as well as a collection of potential Mediator subunits including the p28b, Surf5, HSPC296, and LCMR1 proteins, which we subsequently demonstrated are indeed bona fide Mediator subunits (16Sato S. Tomomori-Sato C. Banks C.A. Sorokina I. Parmely T.J. Kong S.E. Jin J. Cai Y. Lane W.S. Brower C.S. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15123-15127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Among the additional proteins present in the most highly enriched Med8-containing Mediator fractions and identified by mass spectrometry was a previously uncharacterized, 204-amino acid protein encoded by the FLJ10914 ORF. In further experiments, we did not, however, detect the FLJ10914 protein in the well characterized human TRAP/SMCC Mediator complex by Western blotting or mass spectrometry (data not shown), suggesting that it is not an integral subunit of the mammalian Mediator or that it associates only transiently with the complex under some conditions. Consistent with these findings, we observed that the bulk of the detectable FLJ10914 protein present in rat liver nuclear extracts fractionates away from the Med8-containing Mediator complex during chromatography, suggesting that the bulk of the FLJ10914 protein is not associated with the Mediator. To shed light on the function of the FLJ10914 protein and to clarify its relationship with Mediator, we began by attempting to identify FLJ10914-associating proteins. As discussed in more detail below, these efforts led to the discovery that the FLJ10914 protein is associated with components of the TRRAP/TIP60 histone acetyltransferase complex and binds directly to the MORF4-related MRG15 and MRGX proteins. We henceforth refer to the FLJ10914 protein as MRG-binding protein, MRGBP. To expedite isolation of MRGBP-associating proteins, we generated a HeLa cell line stably expressing the MRGBP protein containing an N-terminal FLAG tag. Nuclear extracts were prepared from parental and FLAG-MRGBP expressing HeLa cells and subjected to anti-FLAG-agarose immunoaffinity chromatography. As shown in the silver-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel of Fig. 1A, anti-FLAG-agarose eluates from FLAG-MRGBP expressing HeLa cells included, in addition to FLAG-MRGBP, two abundant proteins of ∼35 and ∼39 kDa and a set of more than 10, less abundant polypeptides ranging in size from ∼43 to more than 300 kDa (lane 3). As shown in lane 2, these polypeptides appear to be specifically associated with FLAG-MRGBP, since they are not apparent in anti-FLAG-agarose eluates prepared from parental HeLa cells. To identify the MRGBP-associating proteins, anti-FLAG-agarose eluates were further fractionated and concentrated by adsorption to a TSK SP-NPR HPLC column at 0.1 m KCl, followed by step elution with buffer containing 1 m KCl. Proteins present in the peak MRGBP-containing fraction were resolved by preparative SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 1B). Proteins present in gel slices were subjected to in-gel reduction, S-carboxyamidomethylation, and digestion with trypsin. The sequences of tryptic peptides, which are presented in Table I of Supplemental Material, were determined in a single run by microcapillary reversed-phase chromatography coupled to the nanospray ionization source of a quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer. Among the MRGBP-associating proteins identified by mass spectrometry in the TSK SP-NPR eluate were the ATM family member TRRAP, the SNF2-related p400 helicase, the Enhancer of Polycomb protein, the histone acetyltransferase TIP60, actin-related protein BAF53a, actin, tubulin, and the AAA ATPases TIP49a and TIP49b, which were all previously shown to be subunits of the multiprotein TRRAP/TIP60 histone acetyltransferase complex, suggesting that the MRGBP protein associates with components of the TRRAP/TIP60 complex. The mammalian MRGBP protein had not been identified previously as a subunit of the TRRAP/TIP60 complex nor had its apparent S. cerevisiae ortholog encoded by the YNL136w ORF (E-value 3e –4) been identified as a subunit of the homologous yeast NuA4 HAT complex. In addition to the known subunits of the TRRAP/TIP60 complex, the TSK SP-NPR eluate contained a set of additional MRGBP-associating proteins not previously recognized as components of the complex (Fig. 1B). These proteins included the thyroid hormone receptor-coactivating protein TRCp120, DMAP1, ING, MRG15, MRGX, Gas41, and the protein encoded by the FLJ11730 ORF, which were present in ∼120-, ∼60-, ∼45-, ∼40-, ∼35-, ∼29-, and ∼27-kDa protein bands, respectively (Fig. 1B); the presence of the TRRAP, DMAP1, TIP60, and MRGBP proteins in anti-FLAG eluates from FLAG-MRGBP expressing but not parental HeLa cells was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 1C). TRCp120 protein (thyroid receptor-coactivating protein p120) was originally identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen as a thryoid hormone receptor-interacting protein that is capable of stimulating thyroid hormone receptor-dependent transcription (17Monden T. Wondisford F.E. Hollenberg A.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29834-29841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). TRCp120 includes a C-terminal bromodomain, and reiterative PSI-BLAST searches of the S. cerevisiae protein data base identified the bromodomain-containing proteins Rsc2, a subunit of the RSC chromatin remodeling complex, and Bdf1 as its two most likely yeast orthologs. Although neither Rsc2 nor Bdf1 had been shown to be components of the yeast NuA4 HAT complex, deletion of Bdf1 is lethal in yeast when combined with mutations in the NuA4 HAT Esa1 or with non-acetylable variants of histone H4 (18Matangkasombut O. Buratowski S. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 353-363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The DMAP1 protein was originally identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen as a DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1)-associated protein and shown to be capable of acting as a transcriptional corepressor in some contexts (19Rountree M.R. Bachman K.E. Baylin S.E. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). The DMAP1 protein shares significant sequence similarity with the protein encoded by the S. cerevisiae YGR002c ORF (E-value 4e –16), which had not been previously identified as a component of the yeast NuA4 HAT complex. Members of the mammalian ING (inhibitor of growth) protein family resemble the S. cerevisiae Yng2 protein, which had been previously identified as a subunit of the yeast NuA4 HAT complex (12Nourani A. Doyon Y. Utley R.T. Allard S. Lane W.S. Cote J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7629-7640Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), suggesting that the ING protein could be a subunit of the TRRAP/TIP60 complex. The chromodomain-containing MRG15 and MRGX proteins share significant sequence similarity (E-value e –106) and are members of a larger family that includes the MORF4 protein, which was originally identified as a protein capable of inducing a senescent phenotype in a subset of immortal human cell lines (20Bertram M.A. Bérubé N.G.

Biol. 2002; 22: 7868-7876Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The human MRG15 and MRGX proteins share significant sequence similarity with the S. cerevisiae chromodomain-containing protein Eaf3 (E-values 7e –33 and 5e –22, respectively), which had been previously identified as a subunit of the yeast NuA4 HAT complex (24Eisen A. Utley R.T. Nourani A. Allard S. Schmidt P. Lane W.S. Lucchesi J.C. Cote J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3484-3491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), suggesting that one or both of the MRG15 and MRGX proteins could be subunits of the TRRAP/TIP60 complex. The Gas41 protein shares significant sequence similarity with the S. cerevisiae Yaf9 protein (E-value e –24), which was very recently identified as a new subunit of the yeast NuA4 HAT complex (25Le Masson I. Yu D.Y. Jensen K. Chevalier A. Courbeyrette R. Boulard Y. Smith M.M. Mann C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6086-6102Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Reiterative PSI-BLAST searches of the S. cerevisiae protein data base suggest that the FLJ11730 protein is related to the S. cerevisiae Eaf6 protein, which has been identified as a possible Esa1-associated protein in the NuA4 complex. 2D. Cronier, S. Allard, and J. Cote, S. cerevisiae genome data base entry. Since neither the mammalian TRCp120 and DMAP1 proteins nor their potential yeast orthologs had been previously identified as subunits of the TRRAP/TIP60 or NuA4 HAT complexes, we sought to determine whether these proteins were previously unrecognized components of the TRRAP/TIP60 complex. As a means of addressing this question, we subjected anti-FLAG-agarose eluates from FLAG-MRGBP expressing HeLa cells to further purification by TSK SP-NPR HPLC. As shown in Fig. 2, both the TRCp120 and DMAP1 proteins cofractionated closely with components of the TRRAP/TIP60 complex. Western blotting analysis revealed that DMAP1 coeluted with TIP60 and TRRAP during TSK SP-NPR HPLC, consistent with the notion that it is a bona fide component of the TRRAP/Tip60 complex (Fig. 2A). In addition, when fractions from TSK SP-NPR HPLC were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and proteins were visualized by silver staining, bands corresponding in size to TRCp120 were observed to coelute from the column with TRRAP. Based (i) on the stoichiometries of MRGBP, MRG15, MRGX, and other components of the TRRAP/TIP60 complex and (ii) on our observation that MRGBP binds directly to MRG proteins (data not shown), the anti-FLAG eluate from FLAG-MRGBP expressing HeLa cells is likely a mixture of the MRGBP-associated TRRAP/TIP60 complex and MRGBP-MRG15 and MRGBP-MRGX heterodimers, which are resolved by TSK SP-NPR HPLC with a peak of MRGBP-MRG15 heterodimers eluting from the column in fractions 16 and 17 and with a peak of MRGBP-MRGX heterodimers eluting from the column in fractions 20 and 21 (Fig. 2B). To characterize further the MRGBP-associating proteins and to confirm the association of TRCp120 and DMAP1 with the TRRAP/TIP60 complex, an anti-FLAG-agarose eluate that had been concentrated by stepwise elution from a TSK SP-NPR column (Fig. 1B) was subjected to analytical gel filtration on Superose 6. Proteins eluting from the column were visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The identities of all proteins labeled in the figure were confirmed by tandem mass spectrometry (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 3, a discrete peak of TRCp120, DMAP1, and MRGX eluted from the column in fractions 33 and 34 with other components of the TRRAP/TIP60 complex, including TRRAP, p400, TIP49a, TIP49b, Baf53, and actin. Whereas a small fraction of the MRGX protein is clearly observed to cofractionate with the TRRAP/TIP60 complex during Superose 6 gel filtration, it is not possible to determine unequivocally whether MRG15 also associates with the TRRAP/TIP60 complex, since a peak containing approximately stoichiometric amounts of MRG15 and MRGBP overlaps the peak of the TRRAP/TIP60 complex. Finally, we note that the TRRAP/TIP60 complex elutes reproducibly from the Superose 6 gel filtration column with a smaller than predicted Stokes radius, similar to that of catalase. Because TRRAP and p400 are themselves substantially larger than catalase, we believe this is most likely due to interaction of one or more proteins in the TRRAP/TIP60 complex with the Superose 6 resin, which has been reported previously to bind some proteins ionically or hydrophobically (see Amersham Biosciences product literature). In summary, in this report we present biochemical evidence that TRCp120, DMAP1, and MRGBP are previously unrecognized components of the mammalian TRRAP/TIP60 histone acetyltransferase complex. Although we initially identified the MRGBP protein in preparations of a Med8-containing Mediator complex from rat liver nuclei, the findings presented here argue that the bulk of detectable MRGBP in nuclear extracts is associated with components of the TRRAP/TIP60 complex. Whether MRGBP associates, perhaps transiently, with the Mediator complex in some contexts remains to be determined. Nevertheless, our findings identify a collection of novel subunits of the TRRAP/TIP60 histone acetyltransferase complex and shed new light on the overall architecture of the complex. We thank Drs. M.

https://openalex.org/W1998783652,"Complete oxidation of carbohydrates to CO<sub>2</sub> is considered to be the exclusive property of the ubiquitous tricarboxylic acid cycle, the central process in cellular energy metabolism of aerobic organisms. Based on metabolism-wide <i>in vivo</i> quantification of intracellular carbon fluxes, we describe here complete oxidation of carbohydrates via the novel P-enolpyruvate (PEP)-glyoxylate cycle, in which two PEP molecules are oxidized by means of acetyl coenzyme A, citrate, glyoxylate, and oxaloacetate to CO<sub>2</sub>, and one PEP is regenerated. Key reactions are the constituents of the glyoxylate shunt and PEP carboxykinase, whose conjoint operation in this bi-functional catabolic and anabolic cycle is in sharp contrast to their generally recognized functions in anaplerosis and gluconeogenesis, respectively. Parallel operation of the PEP-glyoxylate cycle and the tricarboxylic acid cycle was identified in the bacterium <i>Escherichia coli</i> under conditions of glucose hunger in a slow-growing continuous culture. Because the PEP-glyoxylate cycle was also active in glucose excess batch cultures of an NADPH-overproducing phosphoglucose isomerase mutant, one function of this new central pathway may be the decoupling of catabolism from NADPH formation that would otherwise occur in the tricarboxylic acid cycle."

The goal of this study was to search for regulatory elements of the endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) gene responsive to hypoxia. Levels of eNOS mRNA, measured by real time reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis, were increased, and heNOS promoter activity was enhanced by hypoxia as compared with normoxia control experiments. Promoter truncation followed by footprint analysis allowed the mapping and identification of the hypoxia-responsive elements at position –5375 to –5366, closely related to hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-responsive element (HRE). To test whether known HIF-1 and HIF-2 are involved in hypoxia-induced heNOS promoter activation, HMEC-1 and HUVEC were transiently transfected with HIF-1α and HIF-1β or HIF-2α and HIF-1β expression vectors. Exogenous HIF-2 markedly increased luciferase reporter activity driven by the heNOS promoter in its native location. The induction of luciferase was conserved with the antisense construct and was increased in cotransfection experiments when this fragment was cloned 5′ to the proximal 785-bp fragment of the eNOS promoter. Deletion analysis and site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that the two contiguous HIF consensus binding sites spanning bp –5375 to –5366 relative to the transcription start site were both functional for heNOS promoter activity induction by hypoxia and by HIF-2 overexpression. In conclusion, we demonstrate that heNOS is a hypoxia-inducible gene, whose transcription is stimulated through HIF-2 interaction with two contiguous HRE sites located at –5375 to –5366 of the heNOS promoter.

In addition, different physiological and pathological conditions can modulate the level of eNOS expression in endothelial cells (6Li H. Wallerath T. Forstermann U.

In response to hypoxia, systemic arteries vasodilate, allowing more blood to be delivered to peripheral tissues. This vasodilation occurs within seconds after hypoxia and is maintained for hours (12Greenberg B. Kishiyama S. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: H1712-H1720PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular basis of hypoxic vasodilation is not fully understood. Possible mechanisms include direct relaxation of vascular smooth muscle cells induced by changes in pH and ion channel conductance or a decrease in ATP levels (13Leach R.M. Hill H.S. Snetkov V.A. Ward J.P. Respir. Physiol. Neurobiol. 2002; 132: 55-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Endothelial cells also reduce the amount of released vasoconstrictors such as endothelin or thromboxane and release increased amounts of vasodilators such as adenosine, prostacycline, endothelial hyperpolarizing factor, and NO (14Isozumi K. Fukuuchi Y. Takeda H. Itoh Y. Keio J. Med. 1994; 43: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 15McPherson R.W. Koehler R.C. Traystman R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: H476-H482PubMed Google Scholar). Various effects of hypoxia on eNOS expression and NO synthesis in endothelial cells have been described. In some studies the activity (16Pohl U.

Pharmacol. 2001; 421: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The discrepancies between these studies could be explained first by differences in the duration of exposure to hypoxia, and second by the differences in endothelial cell types used. The decrease observed in eNOS mRNA levels during prolonged hypoxia could be due, at least in part, to mRNA destabilization by Rho kinase because it is inhibited by a Rho kinase inhibitor (25Takemoto M. Sun J. Hiroki J. Shimokawa H. Liao J.K. Circulation. 2002; 106: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). No known hypoxia-sensitive element has been reported previously in the eNOS promoter (1600 bp). In two previous studies, a hypoxia-induced up-regulation of the eNOS gene expression in endothelial cells (19Arnet U.A. McMillan A. Dinerman J.L. Ballermann B. Lowenstein C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15069-15073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 20Hoffmann A. Gloe T. Pohl U. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 188: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) was reported but without demonstration of an involvement of an HIF-1 related pathway. In the first study, the 5′-region flanking the eNOS gene (1600-bp) used in transfection experiments for demonstrating hypoxia response does not contain any HIF-1 consensus sequence (19Arnet U.A. McMillan A. Dinerman J.L. Ballermann B. Lowenstein C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15069-15073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The second study showed that the enhanced eNOS expression observed is because of a redox-sensitive AP1-mediated transcription (20Hoffmann A. Gloe T. Pohl U. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 188: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In the present study, we searched for other elements of the eNOS promoter responsible for transcriptional induction under hypoxia. We identified a hypoxia-response element at position –5375 to –5366-bp of the heNOS promoter, and we show that transcription factor HIF-2 preferentially binds this response element under hypoxia and activates eNOS transcription. Materials—Poly(dI·dC) was from Roche Applied Science. Desferrioxamine (DFO), MCDB-131 medium, hydrocortisone, Nonidet P-40 (Igepal), and SYBR-Green JumpStart Taq Ready Mix were from Sigma. Fetal calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin were from Seromed (Berlin, Germany). Human epidermal growth factor (hEGF) and polyethyleneimine suspension (EXGEN 500) were from Euromedex (Souffelweyersheim, France). RPMI medium, phosphate-buffered saline, l-glutamine dNTP, Moloney murine leukemia virus, and RNaseOUT were from Invitrogen. Pfu enzyme was from Stratagene (Amsterdam, The Netherlands). DNase I was from Worthington. Cell Culture—HMEC-1 cells are human dermal microvascular endothelial cells immortalized by transfection with a pBR322-derived plasmid containing the coding region for the simian virus 40 A gene product, large T antigen, and were a gift from Thomas J. Lawley (Emory University, School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA) (26Ades E.W. Candal F.J. Swerlick R.A. George V.G. Summers S. Bosse D.C. Lawley T.J. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1992; 99: 683-690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were isolated as described by Jaffe et al. (27Jaffe E.A. Nachman R.L. Becker C.G. Minick C.R. J. Clin. Investig. 1973; 52: 2745-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (6019) Google Scholar), and cells were used at passage 2 and 3. Both cell types were cultured in MCDB-131 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 10 ng/ml human recombinant epidermal growth factor, and 1 μg/ml hydrocortisone. HeLa cells were cultured in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in an humidified incubator. Hypoxia Treatment—Cells were incubated in a temperature and humidity-controlled environmental chamber IG750 (Jouan) in an atmosphere containing 2% O2, 5% CO2, 94% N2. Hypoxia was also mimicked by treatment with 130 μm of iron chelator DFO. Extraction of RNA and cDNA Synthesis—For preparation of RNA, total RNA was extracted from cells using Trizol® reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After isolation the RNA was used for cDNA synthesis using 0.5 μg of total RNA from each sample, pd(N)6 random hexamer (Amersham Biosciences) and dNTPs (1 mm), 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase, and 20 units of RNase inhibitor. Reverse transcription was carried out for 50 min at 37 °C and stopped by heating to 65 °C for 5 min. Real Time PCR Analysis—The levels of eNOS transcript were determined by real time reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR using SYBR Green chemistry (28Dhar A.K. Roux M.M. Klimpel K.R. J. Clin. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 2835-2845Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). To normalize for input load of cDNA between samples, Ribosomal Protein L32 (RPL32) was used as an endogenous standard. Specific primers were designed with Primer3 (www-genome.wi.mit.edu/cgi-bin/primer/primer3_www.cgi): eNOS1674S, 5′-TGTATGGATGAGTATGACGTG-3′; eNOS1834R, 5′-TGTTCCGGCCGAGGG-3′; RPL32forward, 5′-CCCAAGATCGTCAAAAAGA-3′; and RPL32 reverse, 5′-TCAATGCCTCTGGGTTT-3′. cDNA corresponding to 50 ng of RNA was added to the SYBR-Green JumpStart Taq Ready Mix (0.375 μm of each specific primer, 0.2 μl of internal reference dye, and 10 μl of SYBR-Green JumpStart Taq Ready Mix) in a total volume of 20 μl. PCRs were carried out in a real time PCR cycler (Mx4000, Stratagene). The thermal profile was 95 °C for 2 min, 40 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, and 60 °C for 1 min. At the end of each phase at 60 °C, fluorescence was measured and used for quantitative purposes. eNOS mRNA expression data were normalized to RPL32 content, and relative transcript level between two samples (1 and 2) was calculated using the formula: 2(Ctenos1-CtRPL1)–(Ctenos2-CtRPL2). Independent experiments were performed with different HUVEC preparations derived from different subjects, and then for each preparation two reverse transcriptions were performed, and two PCRs with each reverse transcription were done. DNA Constructs and Site-directed Mutagenesis—A 6047-bp fragment of the heNOS promoter (numbered according to GenBank™ accession number AC092466 sequence) and deletion mutants were cloned upstream from the luciferase gene (29Laumonnier Y. Nadaud S. Agrapart M. Soubrier F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40732-40741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and used in transient transfection experiments. As a control reporter plasmid, the oligonucleotide HRE of the erythropoietin gene 5′-GGAGCTTGCCCTACGTGCTGTCTCAG-3′ (30Semenza G.L. Wang G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5447-5454Crossref PubMed Scopus (2224) Google Scholar) was subcloned 5′ to the luciferase reporter gene driven by the SV40 promoter (vector pGL3-SV40, Promega), creating a construct containing four putative hypoxia-response element (HRE) motifs (HRE-pGL3-SV40). Other constructs were generated by sub-cloning the corresponding Pfu polymerase amplification product 5′ to the 1704- or 785-bp promoter fragments of the heNOS gene. The fragment –5569 to –5005 was subcloned immediately 5′ to the 1704-bp promoter and 5′ to the 785-bp promoter. Reporter plasmids with a 565-bp fragment (–5569 to –5005) divided up into four overlapping parts (part A, –5569 to –5395; part B, –5434 to –5305; part C, –5338 to –5153; and part D, –5203 to –5005) were also generated. The complete cDNAs HIF-1α, HIF-2α, and HIF-1β were RT-PCR-amplified from HUVEC RNA using Pfu enzyme, cloned into the HindIII-EcoRI site of the pcDNA3.1 expression vector (Invitrogen) under the control of the SV40 early promoter, and used in cotransfection experiments (pcDNA3.1-HIF-1α, pcDNA3.1-HIF-2α, and pcDNA3.1-HIF-1β). These expression vectors were also used in in vitro transcription-translation assay. HIF-1α, HIF-2α, and HIF-1β proteins were generated in vitro using a transcription-translation kit (TnT System, Promega). The putative eNOS HRE 41-bp sequence was inserted upstream the SV40 promoter driving the luciferase reporter gene (heHREpGL3SV40). Mutations were introduced into the pGL3-6047 plasmid, using an oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis system (QuickChange Site-directed Mutagenesis kit, Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Constructs and mutants were sequenced using the DYEnamic™ ET Terminator cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Biosciences) and an Applied Biosystems 377 DNA sequencer. Transient Transfection Assays—Cell transfections of plasmid DNA were carried out using polyethyleneimine suspension in a commercially available solution (EXGEN 500). Briefly, HUVECs were plated on a 6-well plate at 2.5 × 105 cells/well, incubated for 24 h, and then incubated for 4 h by adding to 3 ml of fresh medium, 100 μl of transfection mix containing 0.37 pmol of the relevant reporter gene vector, 0.37 pmol of pRenilla luciferase gene vector (Promega) as transfection standardizing control, and 20 μl of EXGEN 500 in 100 mm NaCl. HMEC-1 and HeLa cells were seeded on 2-cm2 multidish plates at 5 × 104 cells/well, incubated 24 h, and then incubated for 4 h by adding to 1 ml of medium 100 μl of transfection mix containing 0.13 pmol of the relevant reporter gene vector, 0.13 pmol of pRenilla luciferase gene vector (Promega), and polyethyleneimine suspension (4 μl for 2 μg of total DNA). Coexpression experiments were performed using expression vectors containing cDNA for various transcription factors, pcDNA3.1-HIF-2α and pcDNA3.1-HIF-1β or pcDNA3.1-HIF-1α and pcDNA3.1-HIF-1β. Similar experimental procedures were used, except that relevant expression vectors were included, in polyethyleneimine suspension at a molar ratio reporter vector/expression vector equal to 10:3. Luciferase activity was measured by luminometry using the dual luciferase revelation system (Promega) as described by the manufacturer. Luciferase signals were normalized for transfection efficiency to the signals obtained with the Renilla luciferase reporter driven by the SV40 promoter. Preparation of Nuclear Protein Extracts—HMEC-1 or HUVEC were grown to subconfluence and then treated or not with 130 μm DFO for 2 h before cell lysis. For hypoxic cell extracts, cell lysis was performed with the cells still under hypoxia to avoid reoxygenation effects. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously by Khachigian et al. (31Khachigian L.M. Williams A.J. Collins T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27679-27686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). DNase I Footprinting Analysis—The –5569 to –5305 heNOS promoter fragment was obtained by PCR. For radioactive labeling, one primer (1.5 pmol) was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 DNA polynucleotide kinase (Invitrogen) before a 25-cycle PCR amplification using 10 pmol of the second primer. DNase I footprinting analyses were performed by incubating 5000 cpm of probe with 40 μg of nuclear extracts for 30 min on ice in 25 mm Hepes, 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol before submission to increasing amounts of DNase I for 2 min. The reactions were performed in the presence of nuclear extracts of cells treated for 2 h by 130 μm DFO compared with control cells. Reactions were stopped by addition of stop buffer (200 μg of proteinase K, 50 mm EDTA, 100 μg/ml tRNA, 1% SDS) and incubated for 1 h at 50 °C. Samples were phenol-extracted, ethanol-precipitated, and recovered in loading buffer (98% formamide, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 0.1% xylene cyanol), denatured, and applied, together with a G + A Maxam-Gilbert sequence of the probe, on a 6% acrylamide, 8 m urea sequencing gel. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Gel retention assays were performed as described previously (30Semenza G.L. Wang G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5447-5454Crossref PubMed Scopus (2224) Google Scholar) using double-stranded [γ-32P]ATP end-labeled oligonucleotide probes. Wild-type and mutated oligonucleotides corresponding to heHRE region were designed according to the sequence of the heNOS promoter (GenBank™ accession number AC092466) (Fig. 4A). Protein translated in vitro (5 μl representing 1/10 of the total reaction mixture) or crude nuclear extracts (5 μg) of DFO-treated or not treated cells were incubated with ∼0.15 pmol of [γ-32P]ATP end-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg of poly(dI·dC). After incubation for 30 min on ice, complexes were resolved by electrophoresis on pre-run 5% acrylamide/bisacrylamide (29:1) native gels. Competition and supershift experiments were performed by preincubating nuclear extract with relevant competitor oligonucleotides or purified antibodies prior to addition of labeled probes. Computer and Statistical Analysis—eNOS promoter regions were analyzed for hypoxia-binding sites using TRANSFAC data base (transfac.gbf.de/TRANSFAC/) and MatInspector 2.0 software (32Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2427) Google Scholar). All transfection data are expressed as mean ± S.E. All transfection data were analyzed by the analysis of variance test. Induction of heNOS mRNA Expression in Endothelial Cells Treated by DFO—The response to DFO was studied for the endogenous heNOS gene by real time semi-quantitative RT-PCR analyses using RPL32 as a reference mRNA. Iron chelation by DFO is used to mimic hypoxia (33Templeton D.M. Liu Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1619: 113-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and induces expression of target genes in particular through the HIF-1/HRE mechanism (34Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. Blood. 1993; 82: 3610-3615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Jiang B.H. Zheng J.Z. Leung S.W. Roe R. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19253-19260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Compared with non-treated cells, the heNOS/RPL32 ratio was significantly increased in HUVEC exposed to DFO for 2 h (1.9-fold ± 0.2, n = 3) and decreased after 8 h (Fig. 1A). Hypoxia time course experiments on HMEC-1 cells revealed similar results (Fig. 1B), showing a rapid increase of eNOS expression after DFO exposure. Functional Regulation of the heNOS Promoter by Hypoxia— To test whether this response was due to a transcriptional effect, three truncated promoter regions located upstream of the heNOS gene were analyzed for their ability to respond to hypoxia (2% O2 for 24 h) in fusion constructs with the luciferase gene. Under hypoxia conditions, an induction was observed in primary cultured endothelial cells (HUVEC) with the 6047-bp heNOS construct (2.3-fold ± 0.25, n = 4) and with the 5523-bp construct (2.3-fold ± 0.18, n = 4), but this response was abolished with the 5039-bp fragment, indicating that a hypoxia-response element (called heHRE for hypoxia-response element of the heNOS gene) is localized between bp –5523 and –5039 of the heNOS promoter (Fig. 2). Similar results were obtained with non-endothelial cells (HeLa cells) (data not shown). In Vitro Footprint Analysis of the Hypoxia-responsive Region of the heNOS Promoter—DNase I footprint experiments were performed to localize sites of hypoxia response in the region of the heNOS distal promoter identified as functional. Computer-assisted analysis of the region allowed us to select a region containing the core sequence of a consensus HIF-1-response element (HRE) 5′-RCGTG-3′ (36Semenza G.L. Jiang B.H. Leung S.W. Passantino R. Concordet J.P. Maire P. Giallongo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32529-32537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1376) Google Scholar) located at –5371. An end-labeled 265-bp PCR product from –5569 to –5305-bp of the heNOS distal promoter was used as a probe in footprint experiments performed with nuclear extracts from DFO-treated or non-treated endothelial cells (HMEC-1 or HUVEC). As shown in Fig. 3, nuclear proteins protected the antisense probe in a large region in DFO-treated cells. This region was not protected in extracts from normoxic cells. The protected element spans 27 bp from –5382 to –5356 and is limited in its 3′-part by a DNase I-hypersensitive site. The same protection was observed using the sense probe (data not shown). The protection observed is centered on two potential HRE sites (site 1, 5′-CGTG-3′ located at –5375, and site 2, 5′-TACGTG-3′located at –5371; Fig. 3). Binding of Hypoxia-inducible Proteins to the eNOS Promoter Region (–5382/–5356)—To identify proteins that bind to the heHRE region, we performed gel-shift experiments. A 41-bp oligonucleotide (eHRE) was designed (Fig. 4A) to be centered on the protected region of the heNOS promoter identified by footprint analysis and contains the two potential overlapping HREs (–5375 to –5366). The double-stranded oligonucleotide eHRE was 32P-labeled and incubated with 5-μg aliquots of nuclear extract from DFO-treated or non-treated HMEC-1 cells. EMSA showed that a specific DNA-protein complex, absent with control extracts from normoxic cells, is formed with nuclear extracts from DFO-treated HMEC-1 (Fig. 4B), because it is displaced by an excess of cold probe. Competition assays with a 10- and 100-fold molar excess of the unlabeled eHRE wild-type (lanes 3 and 4) or mutated probes were performed (Fig. 4B). Mutating only one of the two potential HREs as in mutants E1 (lanes 5 and 6) and E2 (lanes 7 and 8) maintained competition with the probe because of the presence of a DNA-protein interaction involving the other site. However, mutating both sites as in mutants E3 (lanes 9 and 10) and E4 (lanes 11 and 12) abolished the competition with the wild-type probe. Therefore, each of these sites is able to form specific DNA-protein complexes. The first two nucleotides (TA) of the 3′ HRE site located at –5371 are essential for the binding as shown by the E4 mutant (lanes 11 and 12), but the two nucleotides before the 5′-CGTG-3′ of the –5375 HRE site are not essential for the binding as shown by the E5 mutant (lanes 13 and 14) which competed with the probe. As deduced from these experiments, the core sequences of the two sites are CGTG and TACGTG. Other mutations within the 41-bp region but not altering the two core sites resulted in a competition with the wild-type probe and confirmed the essential role of the two core sequences (data not shown). To identify proteins involved in the formation of these complexes, we performed supershift assays. These experiments showed that antiserum raised against HIF-2α (Fig. 4B, lane 3), HIF-1α (lane 5), or HIF-1β (lane 6) but not by the preimmune serum (lane 4) decreased the formation of the hypoxia-inducible complex and provoked the appearance of a supershifted complex. These results indicate that both HIF-1 and HIF-2 are present in these hypoxia-induced complexes. To further confirm these results, we performed EMSA experiments with in vitro translated proteins HIF-2α, HIF-1α, and HIF-1β and wild-type or mutant eHRE probes. DNA-protein-specific complexes with wild-type eHRE probe were observed in the presence of in vitro translated proteins HIF-2α and HIF-1β or HIF-1α and HIF-1β but not with HIF-1α and HIF-2α alone (Fig. 4D). The series of mutant probes used for EMSA experiments showed that only the mutants (E3 and E4) that altered both HRE-like response elements abolished the binding. Therefore, both HIF-1 and HIF-2 complexes are able to bind (on their own) to the heHRE sequence in vitro. Effect of Coexpression of HIF-1 and HIF-2 on the Promoter Activity of the heNOS Gene—To investigate whether the increase in the heNOS promoter activity depends on HIF-1 or HIF-2, we performed cotransfection experiments in different cell types. The reporter plasmid containing 6047 bp of the heNOS promoter upstream to the firefly luciferase coding sequence was cotransfected into HMEC-1, HUVEC, and HeLa cells in the absence or the presence of expression vectors encoding HIF-1α and ARNT (i.e. HIF-1) or HIF-2α and ARNT (i.e. HIF-2) (Fig. 5B). The activation control reporter plasmid HREpGL3-SV40, containing the four putative HRE motifs from the 3′-flanking sequence of the human erythropoietin gene (30Semenza G.L. Wang G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5447-5454Crossref PubMed Scopus (2224) Google Scholar), was also tested in cotransfection experiments (Fig. 5A). Coexpression of HIF-2 or HIF-1 induced transcription of the control HRE reporter plasmid. By using the HIF-1 expression vector, the control reporter expression was increased 3.8 (±0.5), 6.2 (±0.2), and 12.8 (±0.8)-fold (compared with the transfection with the empty pcDNA3.1 vector), respectively, in HMEC-1, HUVEC, and HeLa cells (Fig. 5A). The control reporter expression in the pre"
https://openalex.org/W2051973889,"Many serine proteinase inhibitors of the serpin superfamily have evolved in vertebrates and invertebrates to regulate serine proteinase cascades that mediate the host defense responses. We have isolated an immuneresponsive serpin from the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta. This inhibitor, M. sexta serpin-3, contains a reactive site loop strikingly similar to the proteolytic activation site in prophenoloxidase (pro-PO). Molecular cloning and sequence comparison indicate that serpin-3 is orthologous to Drosophila melanogaster serpin 27A, a regulator of melanization. M. sexta serpin-3 is constitutively present in hemolymph at a low concentration of 5–12 μg/ml and increases to 30–75 μg/ml after a microbial challenge. Recombinant serpin-3 efficiently blocks pro-PO activation in the hemolymph, and it forms SDS-stable acyl-enzyme complexes with purified pro-PO-activating proteinases (PAPs) from M. sexta. PAP-serpin-3 complexes were isolated by immunoaffinity chromatography from hemolymph activated by treatment with Micrococcus luteus. Kinetic analysis of PAP-serpin-3 association strongly suggests that serpin-3 is a physiological regulator of the pro-PO activation reaction."

This peptide consisted of 43 amino acid residues starting from N-terminal pyroglutamic acid and ending at C-terminal arginine-phenylalanine-amide. We therefore named it QRFP after pyroglutamylated arginine-phenylalanine-amide peptide. We subsequently searched for its receptor and found that Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing an orphan G protein-coupled receptor, AQ27, specifically responded to QRFP. We analyzed tissue distributions of QRFP and its receptor mRNAs in rats utilizing quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization. QRFP mRNA was highly expressed in the hypothalamus, whereas its receptor mRNA was highly expressed in the adrenal gland. The intravenous administration of QRFP caused the release of aldosterone, suggesting that QRFP and its receptor have a regulatory function in the rat adrenal gland.

In the last decade, advances in cDNA and genomic DNA sequencing have revealed the existence of hundreds of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) 1The abbreviations used are: GPCRG protein-coupled receptorQRFPpyroglutamylated arginine-phenylalanine-amide peptideRF-amidearginine-phenylalanine-amideRFRPRFamide-related peptideRTreverse transcriptionCHOChinese hamster ovaryFLIPRfluorometric imaging plate readerHEKhuman embryonic kidneyMALDI-TOFmatrix-assisted-laser desorption/ionization time-of-flightACTHadrenocorticotropic hormoneTAMRA5-carboxytetramethylrhodamineFAM5-carboxyfluorescein. genes in the human genome. Those for which the ligands have not yet been identified are referred to as orphan GPCRs. GPCRs play pivotal roles in cell-to-cell communication and in the regulation of cell functions. For this reason, the identification of endogenous ligands for orphan GPCRs will open the door for clarifying new regulatory mechanisms of the human body. Furthermore, as GPCRs are considered to be some of the most important drug target molecules, the identification of ligands of orphan GPCRs will provide opportunities for developing novel drugs (1Hinuma S. Onda H. Fujino M. J. Mol. Med. 1999; 77: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Orphan GPCR research is therefore important from the aspects of both basic and applied science. We have previously established a widely applicable method to identify ligands for orphan GPCRs through monitoring specific signal transductions in cells expressing orphan GPCRs (2Hinuma S. Habata Y.

Through this method we succeeded in identifying various orphan GPCR ligands including peptides with arginine-phenylalanine-amide (RFamide) structure at their C termini (2Hinuma S. Habata Y. Fujii R.

The first report on a peptide with RFamide was the isolation of FMRFamide from bivalve mollusks. Since then, a number of bioactive peptides with the same structure have been found throughout the animal kingdom and are called RFamide peptides (5Price D.A. Greenberg M.J. Science. 1977; 197: 670-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). It has been found that more than 20 RFamide peptide genes encode over 50 distinctive peptides in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (6Li C. Kim K. Nelson L.S. Brain Res. 1999; 848: 26-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In mammals, four RFamide peptide genes have so far been identified, that is neuropeptide FF (7Perry S.J. Yi-Kung H.E. Cronk D.

All of their receptors have been identified through orphan GPCR research. Based on the identification of prolactin-releasing peptide and RFRP, we have proposed that a variety of RFamide peptides exist and have physiological functions even in mammals and that RFamide peptides are evolutionally related to members of the neuropeptide Y family (8Elshourbagy N.A.

However, their precise molecular and functional characterizations remain to be elucidated. In our present research, we have independently found the same new RFamide peptide gene utilizing a human genome data base and subsequently identified its receptor among orphan GPCRs by applying our previously established method. Here we report the molecular characterization of this newly identified RFamide peptide and its receptor including their binding properties and precise tissue distribution determined through in situ hybridization. In addition, we demonstrate that they function to regulate hormone secretion from the adrenal gland in rats. Cloning of QRFP cDNA—To isolate a human QRFP cDNA by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, we designed primers (5′-ATGGTAAGGCCTTACCCCCTGATCTAC-3′ and 5′-CAAATCCTTCCAAGGCGTCCTGGCCCT-3′) based on the Celera Discovery Systems and Celera Genomics-associated data base. PCR was performed in a reaction mixture (25 μl in total) containing a 0.2 μm concentration of the primers, a template cDNA synthesized from human brain poly(A)+ RNA (Clontech) using a Marathon cDNA amplification kit (Clontech), 0.1 mm dNTPs, 1.25 units of KlenTaq DNA polymerase (Clontech), and 2.5 μl of a buffer provided by the manufacturer. This was conducted at 94 °C for 2 min followed by 40 cycles at 98 °C for 10 s, at 63 °C for 20 s, and at 72 °C for 60 s. We obtained a PCR product of about 300 bp containing a full coding region and determined its nucleotide sequence with an ABI Prism 377 DNA sequencer using a dideoxyterminator cycle sequence kit (PE Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Various primers were synthesized on the basis of the human cDNA sequence thus obtained, and with these primers, a rat QRFP cDNA fragment was isolated by RT-PCR from rat brain poly(A)+ RNA. We subsequently synthesized primers based on this cDNA sequence, and then isolated rat QRFP cDNA with a full coding region by 5′- and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends using a Marathon cDNA amplification kit (Clontech). In a manner similar to obtaining the rat cDNA fragment, we isolated mouse and bovine QRFP cDNA from poly(A)+ RNA fractions prepared from mouse brain and bovine hypothalamus, respectively. Cloning of AQ27 cDNAs—We designed primers (5′-TGTCAGCATGCAGGCGCTTAACATTACCCCGGAGCAG-3′ and 5′-GACTAGTTTAATGCCCACTGTCTAAAGGAGAATTCTC-3′) to isolate a human AQ27 cDNA by RT-PCR. The PCR was performed in a reaction mixture (25 μl in total) containing a 0.2 μm concentration of the primers, a template cDNA synthesized from a human fetal brain cDNA (Clontech), 0.2 mm dNTPs, 1.25 units of Advantage 2 polymerase mixture (Clontech), and 2.5 μl of a buffer provided by the manufacturer. The mixture was heated at 95 °C for 1 min followed by 5 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s and at 72 °C for 4 min, 5 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s and at 70 °C for 4 min, 30 cycles of at 95 °C for 30 s, at 68 °C for 30 s, and at 66 °C for 4 min, and finally an extension reaction at 68 °C for 3 min. We obtained a product with about 1600 bp that contained a full coding region and determined its nucleotide sequence. Based on the human cDNA sequence thus obtained, we synthesized various primers and isolated rat and mouse AQ27 cDNA with full coding regions by PCR from rat and mouse brain cDNA, respectively. Preparation of Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) Cells Expressing QRFP cDNA—The entire coding region of the human QRFP cDNA was cloned into the downstream region of an SR α promoter in the expression vector pAKKO-111H (11Hinuma S. Hosoya M. Ogi K. Tanaka H. Nagai Y. Onda H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1219: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The resultant expression vector plasmid was transfected into dhfr– CHO cells, and then dhfr+ CHO cells were selected as described previously (11Hinuma S. Hosoya M. Ogi K. Tanaka H. Nagai Y. Onda H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1219: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Reporter Gene Assays—An expression vector with the human AQ27 cDNA (pAKKO-hAQ27) was constructed by inserting the AQ27 coding region into pAKKO-111H (11Hinuma S. Hosoya M. Ogi K. Tanaka H. Nagai Y. Onda H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1219: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were used as host cells. In transient expression assays, the AQ27 expression vector and a reporter gene (i.e. a fusion gene of cAMP-responsive element and luciferase) were co-transfected into the host cells with LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). After culture overnight, the transfected cells were incubated with test samples for 4 h. After incubation, luciferase activity was measured with a PicaGene LT 2.0 kit (Toyo Ink). Agonistic activities of the samples were detected as the increase of luciferase activity in the presence of forskolin (2 μm). Structual Analysis of QRFP—Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry was performed using a Voyager-DE PRO (PE Applied Biosystems). Samples were mixed with a matrix of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid on a MALDI target. External calibration was performed with ACTH (7–38) and insulin. Data were obtained in the linear and delayed extraction mode with positive polarity. According to the manufacturer, under these conditions mass accuracy at the 0.05% level can be achieved. cAMP Assays—We transfected expression vectors with various GPCR cDNAs in pAKKO-111H into dhfr– CHO cells and established CHO cells expressing each GPCR. Synthetic QRFPs were prepared as described previously (2Hinuma S. Habata Y. Fujii R. Kawamata Y. Hosoya M. Fukusumi S. Kitada C. Masuo Y. Asano T. Matsumoto H. Sekiguchi M. Kurokawa T. Nishimura O. Onda H. Fujino M. Nature. 1998; 393: 272-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). The suppression of forskolin-induced cAMP production in CHO cells was determined as described previously (12Fukusumi S. Kitada C. Takekawa S. Kizawa H. Sakamoto J. Miyamoto M. Hinuma S. Kitano K. Fujino M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Ca2+Mobilization Assays—Ca2+ mobilization assays using a stable CHO cell line expressing AQ27 (CHO-hAQ27) cells and mock CHO cells were conducted as described elsewhere (13Hosoya M. Moriya T. Kawamata Y. Ohkubo S. Fujii R. Matsui H. Shintani Y. Fukusumi S. Habata Y. Hinuma S. Onda H. Nishimura O. Fujino M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29528-29532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations induced by QRFPs were measured with a fluorometric imaging plate reader (FLIPR; Amersham Biosciences). Receptor Binding Assays—Receptor binding assays were conducted principally as described previously (8Elshourbagy N.A. Ames R.S. Fitzgerald L.R. Foley J.J. Chambers J.K. Szekeres P.G. Evans N.A. Schmidt D.B. Buckley P.T. Dytko G.M. Murdock P.R. Milligan G. Groarke D.A. Tan K.B. Shabon U. Nuthulaganti P. Wang D.Y. Wilson S. Bergsma D.J. Sarau H.M. J. Biol.

In brief, a tyrosine residue of synthetic human QRFP (i.e. <EDEGSEATGFLPAAGEKTSGPLGNLAEELNGYSRKKGGFSFRFamide, where <E indicates pyroglutamic acid) was radioiodinated with Na125I (IMS-30, Amersham Biosciences) by using lactoperoxidase. This labeling did not affect its cAMP production-inhibitory activity on CHO cells expressing AQ27 (data not shown). The membrane fractions of CHO-hAQ27 cells were mixed with [125I-Tyr32]QRFP and incubated at room temperature for 90 min. To determine the amount of nonspecific binding, 1 μm unlabeled QRFP was added to the mixture. After filtration, the radioactivity of [125I-Tyr32]QRFP bound to the membrane fractions was determined. Quantification of Rat QRFP and AQ27 mRNAs by RT-PCR— Poly(A)+ RNA fractions were prepared from rat tissues, and their expression levels of QRFP and AQ27 mRNAs were quantitatively analyzed by means of RT-PCR using an ABI Prism 7700 sequence detector as described elsewhere (14Fujii R. Hosoya M. Fukusumi S. Kawamata Y. Habata Y. Hinuma S. Onda H. Nishimura O. Fujino M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21068-21074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The following primer sets and probes were used: 5′-AGCACACTGGCTTCCGTCTAG-3′, 5′-CGCTGGCCTTCTCTGAGTCA-3′, and 5′(FAM)-AGGCAGGACAGTGGCAGTGAAGCC-(TAMRA)3′ for rat QRFP mRNA and 5′-CGGAAGCCTGGGAATTCTG-3′, 5′-ATGTGTCTCCTTTGGTTTCTTCCA-3′, and 5′(FAM)-AGCAAAGTTATCTCGACCACAGCGTCCA-(TAMRA)3′ for rat AQ27 mRNA. PCR was performed at 50 °C for 10 min for the reaction of uracil-N-glycosylase to prevent the amplification of carried over PCR products, at 95 °C for 2 min for the activation of AmplyTaq Gold DNA polymerase, and for 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and at 57 °C for 80 s for the amplification. In Situ Hybridization—Under pentobarbital anesthesia, male Wistar rats (8–9 weeks old) were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde via the left cardiac ventricle. Frozen sections prepared from the brains and adrenal glands were hybridized with digoxigenin-labeled antisense RNA probes synthesized from full-length rat QRFP and AQ27 template cDNAs according to the floating method described previously (15Fujiwara K. Maruyama M. Usui K. Sakai T. Matsumoto H. Hinuma S. Kitada C. Inoue K. Neurosci. Lett. 2003; 338: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Visualization of QRFP and AQ27 mRNAs was conducted with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibody using 4-nitroblue tetrazolium chloride and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate. Assays for Plasma Hormone Concentrations—Male Wistar rats (8–9 weeks old) were provided with food and water ad libitum and kept under controlled lighting (lights on 8:00 to 20:00) and temperature (25 °C) until used for the experiments. A cannula was inserted into the right jugular vein of each rat under sodium pentobarbital anesthesia (50 mg/kg). The cannula-implanted rats were housed in individual cages where they were kept for 3 days before the experiments. The day after the implantation, 10 μl of phosphate-buffered saline either with or without the peptide was injected into the right jugular vein via the inserted cannula. Before the intravenous injection of the peptide, 400 μl of blood was withdrawn from each rat through the cannula, and 0.01 m EDTA with aprotinin (300 kallikrein-inactivating units/ml) was immediately added. This was performed between 13:00 and 17:00. Plasma aldosterone concentrations were determined by radioimmunoassay. To analyze other adrenal gland hormones (i.e. corticosterone and testosterone), other sets of rats were treated in the same manner, and their plasma concentrations were measured as described previously (8Elshourbagy N.A. Ames R.S. Fitzgerald L.R. Foley J.J. Chambers J.K. Szekeres P.G. Evans N.A. Schmidt D.B. Buckley P.T. Dytko G.M. Murdock P.R. Milligan G. Groarke D.A. Tan K.B. Shabon U. Nuthulaganti P. Wang D.Y.

Identification of a Novel RFamide Peptide Gene—We searched for unknown members of the RFamide peptide family in the human genome data base using queries to detect repetitive patterns generating RFamide peptide (i.e. RFGR or RFGK where RF is followed by G as an amide donor and by R or K as a proteolytic cleavage site) and a secretory signal peptide sequence upstream of the patterns as reported previously (8Elshourbagy N.A. Ames R.S. Fitzgerald L.R. Foley J.J. Chambers J.K. Szekeres P.G. Evans N.A. Schmidt D.B. Buckley P.T. Dytko G.M. Murdock P.R. Milligan G. Groarke D.A. Tan K.B. Shabon U. Nuthulaganti P. Wang D.Y.

Signal sequences were predicted with the SignalP Version 2.0 software program (16Nielsen H. Brunak S. Heijne V.G. Protein Eng. 1999; 12: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). By this search, we found a human genomic sequence that possibly encoded an RFamide peptide (i.e. QRFP). On the basis of the sequences detected, we isolated human, bovine, rat, and mouse cDNAs with full coding regions by RT-PCR. The isolated cDNAs encoded preproproteins with amino acid lengths of 124–136 (Fig. 1). In each preproprotein sequence, 17 or 18 amino acid residues at the N-terminal were thought to comprise the secretory signal peptide. Two RFGR motifs were found in the human preproprotein. The motif at the C-terminal side was conserved among the different species, but that at the N-terminal was not. Based on these sequence analyses, we predicted that an RFamide peptide (QRFP) would be produced from the C-terminal motif in the human preproprotein. In addition, we noticed that the C-terminal amino acid sequence of the predicted RFamide peptide (i.e. GGFSFRF-amide) quite resembled that of Met-enkephalinamide (i.e. YGGFMRFamide) (Fig. 2). However, QRFP did not show apparent homology to other known mammalian RFamide peptides except for its RFamide structure.Fig. 2Comparison of amino acid sequences of known RFamide peptides and QRFP.

We have previously searched for ligands of various orphan GPCRs by exposing synthetic peptides to CHO cells expressing orphan GPCRs (2Hinuma S. Habata Y. Fujii R. Kawamata Y. Hosoya M. Fukusumi S. Kitada C. Masuo Y. Asano T. Matsumoto H. Sekiguchi M. Kurokawa T. Nishimura O. Onda H. Fujino M. Nature. 1998; 393: 272-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 3Tatemoto K. Hosoya M. Habata Y. Fujii R. Kakegawa T. Zou M.X. Kawamata Y. Fukusumi S. Hinuma S. Kitada C. Kurokawa T. Onda H. Fujino M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 471-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (1363) Google Scholar). We found that CHO cells expressing the orphan GPCR, AQ27, weakly but specifically responded to Met-enkephalinamide peptide (data not shown). AQ27 is a novel GPCR that we isolated from human brain poly(A)+ RNA based on public genome information (GenBank™ accession number AQ270411), and has been found to be identical to GPR103 as recently reported (17Lee D.K. Nguyen T. Lynch K.R. Cheng R. Vanti W.B. Arkhitko O. Lewis T. Evans J.F. George S.R. O'Dowd B.F. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 275: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). We isolated its rat and mouse counterparts from their respective brain poly(A)+ RNA by RT-PCR. The amino acid sequences deduced from human, rat, and mouse cDNA are aligned in Supplemental Fig. 1. These had amino acid lengths of 431 or 433 and showed 84–96% amino acid identity to each other. Among the GPCRs for which ligands are known, AQ27 showed homology with OT7T022 (the receptor for RFRP) and HLWAR77 (the receptor for neuropeptide FF), that is 30 and 32% amino acid identity, respectively, as determined by the Gapped Blast program. As a result of phylogenic analysis, GPR103 has been predicted to be an RFamide peptide receptor (18Joost, P., and Methner, A. (2002) Genome Biol., http://genomebiology.com/2002/3/11/RESEARCH/0063,Google Scholar). We therefore inferred that QRFP might act as a ligand for AQ27. To examine this, we synthesized a short peptide with an amino acid length of 7 (GGFSFRFamide). We derived this from the C-terminal RFGR motif of the human QRFP preproprotein because, in RFamide peptides, C-terminal portions are essential sites to bind receptors, and even short C-terminal peptides frequently retain receptor binding activity (19Yoshida H. Habata Y. Hosoya M. Kawamata Y. Kitada C. Hinuma S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1593: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). We subjected this short peptide to an assay with HEK293 cells transiently expressing AQ27 and a reporter gene (cAMP-responsive element-luciferase). This assay was modified from the method of Chen et al. (20Durocher Y. Perret S. Thibaudeau E. Gaumond M.H. Kamen A. Stocco R. Abramovitz M. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 284: 316-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 21Chen W. Shields T.S. Stork P.J. Cone R.D. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 226: 349-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). They demonstrated that the activation of GPCRs coupled with Gs and/or Gq causes an increase in the transcription of the cAMP-responsive element promoter. We modified their method for detecting Gq signals so that, by our technique, Gq signals were detected as the increase of luciferase activity in the presence of forskolin. As AQ27 coupled to Gq, we detected the activation of AQ27 treated with the peptide as the increase of luciferase activity (data not shown). However, the agonistic activity of this peptide appeared to be very weak with its effective dose ranging from 10–5 to 10–6m (data not shown). Determination of a Fully Active Form of QRFP—As the agonistic activity of the 7-amino acid-long synthetic peptide was considerably weak, we thought that a longer form of the peptide would show full activity. To ascertain this, we expressed the human QRFP cDNA in CHO cells and examined whether more effective peptidic ligands were secreted in the culture supernatant. As we could detect specific and strong stimulatory activity on HEK293 cells expressing AQ27 in the culture supernatant, we decided to purify the ligands for AQ27 from the culture supernatant. To do so, we used affinity column chromatography using a monoclonal antibody (1F3) for RFRP-1 (22Fukusumi S. Habata Y. Yoshida H. Iijima N. Kawamata Y. Hosoya M. Fujii R. Hinuma S. Kitada C. Shintani Y. Suenaga M. Onda H. Nishimura O. Tanaka M. Ibata Y. Fujino M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1540: 221-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) because 1F3 could cross-react with the short form of QRFP (GGFSFRFamide). The culture supernatant (2.4 L) was boiled and centrifuged, and the resulting supernatant was applied to the affinity chromatography. Elution was conducted with 0.2 m glycine-HCl (pH 2.2) containing 0.5 m NaCl. The eluate was subsequently fractionated through a Vydac C18 218TP5415 column with a 20–35% linear gradient of CH3CN, and each fraction was examined in assays with HEK293 cells transiently expressing human AQ27 and a reporter gene. Finally active fractions in the assays were applied to μRPC C2/C18 SC2.1/10 column chromatography. AQ27-stimulatory activities were detected in eluted fractions, which corresponded to at least two peaks (i.e. peaks 1 and 2 in Fig. 3A). Although peaks 1 and 2 matched absorbance peaks at 215 nm, the main absorbance peak at 280 nm matched only with peak 1. In the C-terminal region of QRFP there is a Tyr residue that should give absorbance at 280 nm. Since the absorbance of peak 2 was faint at 280 nm, we believe that it contained impurities. In the reporter gene assay, both peaks appeared to reach plateau levels of luciferase activity. Considering these results, we concluded that peak 1 was a major product derived from the QRFP cDNA-transfected CHO cells and that peak 2 was not a major peak, although it showed activity. We determined the structure of the purified peptide in peak 1 as follows. Since the quantity of the peptide in peak 1 was calculated to be less than 1 pmol from its absorbance peak height, we analyzed it by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Fig. 3B) and found that it produced a protonated molecular ion (m/z 4505.7). Considering this together with other evidence, we concluded the structure of the peptide to be <EDEGSEATGFLPAAGEKTSGPLGNLAEELNGYSRKKGGFSFRFamide (<E indicates pyroglutamic acid). Although we could not determine from the mass spectrometric data whether or not the C-terminal residue was amidated, we determined the C-terminal RFamide structure of the peptide by the following reasoning. (i) The cDNA sequence of QRFP had motifs to generate RFamide peptides, and we knew that the synthetic 7-amino acid-long peptide with C-terminal RFamide showed weak but significant agonistic activity in the reporter assay (data not shown). (ii) It has been well established that RFamide structure is essential for RFamide peptides to interact with their receptors (23Mekler D.J. Enzyme Microb. Technol. 1994; 16: 450-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). (iii) We confirmed with synthetic peptides that the nonamidated form of this peptide showed drastically reduced agonistic activity (Table I). (iv) The M + H+ calculated average masses of the amidated and nonamidated form were 4504.9 and 4505.9, respectively. Although the M + H+ observed average mass (m/z 4505.7) seemed to be closer to the M + H+ calculated average mass of the nonamidated peptide than that of the amidated form, both M + H+ calculated average masses were within the allowable error limit (0.05%) of delayed extraction MALDITOF mass spectrometry in linear mode using external calibration. Therefore, the mass spectrometric data did not contradict the predicted RFamide structure. We determined the N-terminal structure as follows. (i) It is well known that an N-terminal glutamine or glutamic acid residue is easily circularized and converted to pyroglutamic acid (24Busby Jr., W.H. Quackenbus"
https://openalex.org/W2069283306,"We have identified a novel protein-disulfide isomerase and named it endothelial protein-disulfide isomerase (EndoPDI) because of its high expression in endothelial cells. Isolation of the full-length cDNA showed EndoPDI to be a 48 kDa protein that has three APWCGHC thioredoxin motifs in contrast to the two present in archetypal PDI. Ribonuclease protection and Western analysis has shown that hypoxia induces EndoPDI mRNA and protein expression. In situ hybridization analysis showed that EndoPDI expression is rare in normal tissues, except for keratinocytes of the hair bulb and syncytiotrophoblasts of the placenta, but was present in the endothelium of tumors and in other hypoxic lesions such as atherosclerotic plaques. We have compared the function of EndoPDI to that of PDI in endothelial cells using specific siRNA. PDI was shown to have a protective effect on endothelial cells under both normoxia and hypoxia. In contrast, EndoPDI has a protective effect only in endothelial cells exposed to hypoxia. The loss of EndoPDI expression under hypoxia caused a significant decrease in the secretion of adrenomedullin, endothelin-1, and CD105; molecules that protect endothelial cells from hypoxia-initiated apoptosis. The identification of an endothelial PDI further extends this increasing multigene family and EndoPDI, unlike archetypal PDI, may be a molecule with which to target tumor endothelium.

Protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI) 1The abbreviations used are: PDIprotein-disulfide isomeraseERendoplasmic reticulumEndoPDIendothelial protein-disulfide isomeraseHUVEChuman umbilical vein endothelial cellsHDMEChuman dermal microvascular endothelial cellsFACSfluorescence-activated cell sortingsiRNAshort interfering RNAvWFvon Willebrand factorFITCfluorescein isothiocyanateTrxthioredoxin. is a ubiquitously expressed multifunctional protein found in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It constitutes around 0.8% of total cellular protein and can reach near millimolar concentrations in the ER lumen of some tissues. PDI plays a role in protein folding because of its ability to catalyze the formation of native disulfide bonds and disulfide bond rearrangement (1Freedman R.B. Hirst T.R. Tuite M.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 331-336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Proteins targeted for secretion by the cell are inserted into and translocated across the ER membrane and enter the ER lumen in an unfolded state. PDI, together with a variety of other folding factors and molecular chaperones resident in the ER correctly fold the proteins ready for secretion (2Gething M.J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (3607) Google Scholar). The accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER, known as the Unfolded Protein Response, results in increased transcription of chaperones and folding catalysts. Proteins that fail to fold correctly are relocated to the cytosol for proteasomal degradation. protein-disulfide isomerase endoplasmic reticulum endothelial protein-disulfide isomerase human umbilical vein endothelial cells human dermal microvascular endothelial cells fluorescence-activated cell sorting short interfering RNA von Willebrand factor fluorescein isothiocyanate thioredoxin. PDI is a modular protein consisting of a, b, b′, a′, and c domains (3Edman J.C. Ellis L. Blacher R.W. Roth R.A. Rutter W.J. Nature. 1985; 317: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). The a and a′ domains show sequence and structural homology to thioredoxin (Trx) and both contain the active site WCGHCK motif, constituting two independent catalytic sites for thiol-disulfide bond exchange reactions (4Hawkins H.C. Freedman R.B. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 335-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 5LaMantia M.L. Lennarz W.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 899-908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 6Lyles M.M. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30946-30952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Darby N.J. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11725-11735Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). A rate-limiting step in the folding of many newly synthesized proteins is the formation of disulfide bridges (1Freedman R.B. Hirst T.R. Tuite M.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 331-336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar) and the presence of WCGHCK in PDI is essential for this process, as confirmed by the loss of PDI activity following mutation of the cysteine residues within these motifs (5LaMantia M.L. Lennarz W.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 899-908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 8Yao Y. Zhou Y. Wang C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The b and b′ domains also have the thioredoxin structural fold but lack the active site motif. Thus, PDI contains both redox active and inactive thioredoxin modules. The C-terminal c domain, a putative Ca2+ binding region, is rich in acidic amino acids and contains the -KDEL motif, which is necessary and sufficient for the retention of a polypeptide within the lumen of the ER. The C-terminal domain is, however, not necessary for the enzymatic, chaperone (see below) or disulfide isomerase activities of PDI (9Koivunen P. Pirneskoski A. Karvonen P. Ljung J. Helaakovski T. Notbohm H. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In fact, the smallest PDI fragment showing an efficient catalysis of disulfide bond rearrangement has been shown to be a construct containing the b′-a′-c modules (7Darby N.J. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11725-11735Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In addition to its disulfide isomerase activity, PDI also shows chaperone activity, for example it can function as the β-subunit of prolyl-4 hydroxylase, preventing the misfolding and aggregation of the α-subunit (10John D.C. Grant M.E. Bulleid N.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1587-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This function is similar to that of some molecular chaperones such as Hsp90 in other proteins (1Freedman R.B. Hirst T.R. Tuite M.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 331-336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PDI is able to interact with and correctly fold type X collagen polypeptides that contain no cysteine residues (11McLaughlin S.H. Bulleid N.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 793-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). There is now an increasing family of protein-disulfide isomerases, each having two or more thioredoxin or catalytically inactive b domains (1Freedman R.B. Hirst T.R. Tuite M.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 331-336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 12Clissold P.M. Bicknell R. Bioessays. 2003; 25: 603-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Sequence homology between members is poor, their relatedness lying in the structural similarity of the thioredoxin-like fold (12Clissold P.M. Bicknell R. Bioessays. 2003; 25: 603-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that different PDIs may show different substrate specificities (1Freedman R.B. Hirst T.R. Tuite M.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 331-336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar) and support for this has been provided in studies showing that ERp57 is specific for the folding of N-glycosylated proteins (13Elliott J.G. Oliver J.D. High S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13849-13855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 14Oliver J.D. van der Wal F.J. Bulleid N.J. High S. Science. 1997; 275: 86-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). We now report the identification of a novel PDI-like protein, which we have called EndoPDI because of its high expression in endothelial cells. This tissue-specific expression is unusual among members of the PDI family (12Clissold P.M. Bicknell R. Bioessays. 2003; 25: 603-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Previous work has shown that PDI, the archetypal member of the PDI family, can protect neurons and endothelial cells from hypoxic cell death. Thus, we have investigated whether EndoPDI can similarly protect endothelial cells from stress-induced apoptosis and compared its activity to that of PDI. In contrast to PDI, which is essential for the survival of endothelial cells in the resting as well as the stressed state, EndoPDI protects endothelial cells only under conditions of stress. We have sought a possible protective role of EndoPDI under hypoxia and found that loss of EndoPDI results in reduced secretion of adrenomedullin and endothelin-1 together with a reduction in membrane-bound CD105. While EndoPDI is essential for folding of CD105, PDI is not, illustrating differences at the molecular level in the mechanisms of protection afforded by two molecules. Bioinformatic Methods—EndoPDI was initially found as a gene preferentially expressed in vascular endothelial cells by analysis of expression data deposited in SAGEmap (15Lash A.E. Tolstoshev C.M. Wagner L. Schuler G.D. Strausberg R.L. Riggins G.J. Altschul S.F. Genome. Res. 2000; 10: 1051-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Briefly, the SAGEmap data set was downloaded from the project website (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SAGE/) in February 2001 and deposited in a MySQL data base. Only normal tissue libraries (total = 37) were used in the analysis. There were two libraries representing vascular endothelium; SAGE Duke HMVEC and SAGE Duke HMVEC+VEGF. The Preferential Expression Measure (PEM) was used to identify genes preferentially expressed in vascular endothelium. PEM = log(o/e), where o is the observed SAGE tag count in vascular endothelium, and e is the expected tag count if the distribution was uniform across the libraries. e = (G * N/T), where G is the total number of SAGE tags for a given gene, N is the total number of tags for vascular endothelium (110, 460), and T is the total number of tags in all normal libraries (1, 077, 231). The vascular endothelial PEM score for EndoPDI was 1.941. The highest vascular endothelial score yet seen is attributed to EGF-containing fibulin-like extracellular matrix protein-1 at 2.081. Von Willebrand factor (vWF) is a well characterized endothelial-specific gene that had a PEM score of 1.847. Culture of Endothelial Cells—Human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMEC) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were purchased from Clonetics BioWhittaker (Wokingham, Berkshire, UK) and were cultured in MCDB131 medium (Invitrogen) containing 20% fetal calf serum (Sigma-Aldrich), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm glutamine, 5 IU/ml heparin, and 50 μg/ml endothelial cell growth supplement (Sigma, Dorset, UK). Cells were routinely split 1 in 3 and were used up to the 8th passage. Isolation of Full-length cDNA for EndoPDI—Total RNA was extracted from HDMEC and 1 μg was reverse transcribed using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The first 270 nucleotides at the 5′-end were then amplified by PCR using the upstream primer 5′-CCGGTACCCCCGCGCGCCCAGGACGCCTCCTCC-3′, designed to include a KpnI restriction endonuclease site, and the downstream primer 5′-GCAGCATCCAGTTTTCCAGT-3′ and the PCR product cloned into the topo II PCR vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced. An IMAGE clone (3356029) containing partial EndoPDI cDNA sequence was identified from the Unigene data base. The clone is complete at the 3′-end but is truncated by 255 nucleotides at the 5′-end. The unique BstUI site at position 267 was used to enable the ligation of the IMAGE clone EndoPDI insert with the cloned 270 nucleotides of the 5′-end to give a full-length cDNA of EndoPDI. Production of Polyclonal Antibodies to EndoPDI and Western Blotting—The peptide of sequence ADGEDGQDPHSKC was synthesized by the Protein and Peptide Chemistry Department of Cancer Research UK, using standard techniques. This sequence corresponds to amino acids 52–63 of the human EndoPDI protein sequence with an additional cysteine residue added to the C terminus to enable coupling to a carrier protein. The peptide was coupled to Imject® Maleimide-activated mcKLH (Pierce) following the manufacturer's instructions and diluted with Freund's adjuvant before injection into rabbits. A standard immunization protocol was followed with 200 μg of immunogen used for the first injection and 100 μg of immunogen for subsequent boosts. The test bleeds were screened against pre-bleeds by ELISA to identify the presence of antibodies to EndoPDI in the rabbit serum. Serum that was found to contain EndoPDI antibodies by ELISA was used at 1:100 dilution in Western blotting experiments for the detection of EndoPDI protein by standard Western blotting techniques. Antibodies to PDI were purchased from Bioquote Ltd. (North Yorkshire, England) for use in Western blotting. Preparation of a Recombinant EndoPDI Construct for Riboprobe Synthesis—A 300-bp region of the 3′-UTR of EndoPDI was amplified by PCR from plasmid DNA containing the EndoPDI clone described above using 5′-TGTGGCTCCTGAGTTGAGTG-3′ as the upstream forward primer and 5′-ACTCAGGCACGGTCAGAAGT-3′ as the reverse downstream primer. The Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) (16Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar) was used to ensure that the chosen region of EndoPDI did not have homology to other sequences. The PCR product was cloned into pCRII-TOPO (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions and sequenced to confirm identity and orientation. Riboprobes were transcribed (MAXIscript in vitro transcription kit, Ambion AMS Ltd, Witney, Oxon, UK) from linearized plasmids in the presence of [32P]UTP (Amersham Biosciences) to give radioactively labeled probe. RNase Protection Assay—Total RNA was extracted from cells in culture using TRI reagent (Sigma). RNase protection assays were performed in duplicate on 10–30 μg of total RNA as described (16Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar). To attenuate the signal strength of the highly abundant loading control, U6 small nuclear RNA (accession no. X01366), a riboprobe of significantly lower specific activity was prepared by addition of unlabeled CTP to the labeling reaction. The protected fragment size for EndoPDI was 300 nucleotides. In each assay, a positive and negative (tRNA only) control and undigested riboprobes were analyzed. Intensity of signal, quantified on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Chesham, Buckinghamshire, UK) was calculated as the ratio of the signal of interest to U6 mRNA to correct for variations in loading. In Situ Hybridization—In situ hybridization analysis was performed with radioactively labeled probes as described in Poulsom et al., 1998 (17Poulsom R. Longcroft J.M. Jeffery R.E. Rogers L.A. Steel J.H. Eur. J. Histochem. 1998; 42: 121-132PubMed Google Scholar). The EndoPDI-specific probe used for in situ hybridization was the same as that used for the RNase protection assay described above. Human tissue was collected with full ethical approval during routine pathology, fixed in formalin, and embedded in paraffin. Multiple Tissue Array Analysis—Human multiple tissue expression arrays (Clontech, Oxford, UK) with poly(A)+ RNA from different tissues were used for analysis of the distribution of EndoPDI mRNA in human tissues. DNA from the same region of EndoPDI used for riboprobe production was used for preparation of a cDNA probe. The cDNA was labeled with [32P]dCTP (Rediprime random primer labeling kit, Amersham Biosciences) and hybridized at 65 °C overnight in ExpressHyb (Clontech) solution following the manufacturer's instructions. Transfection of Microvascular Endothelial Cells with siRNA—EndoPDI specific (5′-GAAGCTGTGAAGTACCAGGTT-3′) and PDI-specific (5′-GACCTCCCCTTCAAAGTTGTT-3′) siRNA oligos were synthesized using the Silencer™ siRNA Construction kit (Ambion, Huntingdon, UK) following the manufacturer's instructions. HDMEC (5 × 105 cells) were plated onto 0.2% gelatin coated 10-cm Petri dishes and incubated for 24 h. Cells were then transfected with 10 nm EndoPDI and/or PDI siRNA using oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were then incubated for 24 h prior to hypoxia for 16 h (0.1% O2,5%CO2, and 94.9% N2) or continuation of normoxic exposure for 16 h before performing FACS analysis as described. FACS Analysis—To distinguish apoptotic from necrotic cells, double staining for exposed phosphatidylserine and propidium iodide (PI) exclusion was performed as follows: Cells were harvested, washed twice with PBS, and resuspended in binding buffer (10 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2). 5 μl of annexin V-FITC antibody (BD Pharmingen, San Diego) and 10 μl of PI (50 μg/ml) were added to the cells. After incubation for 15 min in the dark at room temperature, the cells were analyzed by a FACScan. Controls of unstained cells, cells stained with annexin V-FITC only, and cells stained with PI only were used to set up compensation and quadrants. The cell surface expression of CD105 was quantified by incubating 105 cells per tube with 50 μl (10 μl/ml in phosphate-buffered saline) of monoclonal antibody to CD105 on ice for 1 h and washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline. After incubation with FITC-labeled rabbit anti-mouse F(ab)2 (1/40 DAKO) for 30 min on ice, the cells were washed and resuspended in 0.3 ml of 2% buffered formalin and analyzed on a FACScan. Measurement of Endothelin-1 Secretion by ELISA—The secretion of endothelin-1 by endothelial cells was measured using a human endothelin-1 ELISA (R&D Systems, Abindgdon, UK) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 50,000 cells were treated with RNAi oligos as before, the medium collected and diluted 1/25 for use in the ELISA. Measurement of Adrenomedullin by Radioimmunoassay—The secretion of adrenomedullin by endothelial cells was measured using an adrenomedullin radioimmunoassay (Peninsula Laboratories Europe, Ltd, Merseyside, England) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 50,000 cells were treated with RNAi oligos as before, the medium collected and used in the radioimmunoassay. Identification of EndoPDI using Bioinformatic and cDNA Sequence Analysis—We utilized serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) libraries (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SAGE) to find genes that are highly expressed in endothelial cells. Using this approach we identified a novel gene, which we subsequently called EndoPDI, that is highly expressed in both VEGF-stimulated and quiescent microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC) with counts of 1224 and 741 tags per million, respectively (Table I). The library with the next highest tag count for EndoPDI was the foreskin fibroblast library with 204 tags per million, i.e. less than a third of that for HMVEC. Homologues of EndoPDI have been identified in the mouse, rat, Xenopus, Drosophila, and mosquito (Fig. 1A). While PDI has only two APWCGHC thioredoxin motifs, EndoPDI has three (Fig. 1B); however, both have in common a C-terminal KDEL sequence, which is characteristic of proteins that are retained within the endoplasmic reticulum. We used the Neural Network program, SignalIP (18Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4942) Google Scholar) to analyze the protein sequence of EndoPDI and found that it contains a signal peptide, MPARPGRLLPLLARPAALTALLLLLLGHGGGGRW at the N terminus with the most likely cleavage site being located between positions 32 and 33 (GGG-RW). All other members of the PDI family contain a domain that has the thioredoxin structural fold, also called the b domain, but contain no thioredoxin active site. Using the structure prediction program VAST (19Gibrat J.F. Madej T. Bryant S.H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar) we found that EndoPDI has the structure ao, a, a′, c, with no b domain (Fig. 1B).Table IExpression of EndoPDI in SAGE libraries of normal tissues The NCBI database for serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) was used to examine the relative expression of EndoPDI. EndoPDI expression was found in a total of 211 libraries, and of these, 26 were derived from normal tissues. The tags per million counts for EndoPDI in these 26 libraries is shown in the table.Cell/Tissue typeTags per millionSAGE Duke HMVEC + VEGF (vascular normal endothelium cell line)1224SAGE Duke HMVEC (vascular normal endothelium cell line)741Foreskin fibroblasts204SAGE TSU (prostate normal cell line)175SAGE PR317 (prostate normal SAGE microdissected)117SAGE H126 (pancreas epithelium ductal normal cell line)91SAGE 293 CTRL (kidney normal cell line)90SAGE IOSE29 11 (ovary epithelium normal cell line)82SAGE 293 IND (kidney normal cell line)63SAGE HOSE 4 (ovary epithelium normal)61SAGE Chen Normal Pr (prostate normal bulk)60SAGE mammary epithelium (mammary gland epithelium ductal normal)60SAGE NHA (5th) brain normal SAGE astrocyte57SAGE breast myoepithelial (mammary gland normal myoepithelial)51SAGE NC2 (epithelium normal colon)40SAGE NC1 (epithelium normal colon)39SAGE normal gastric body epithelium (stomach normal)39SAGE PERITO 13 (normal peritoneum)36SAGE normal pediatric cortex H1571 (normal cortex juvenile)25SAGE normal lung22SAGE Duke thalamus (normal bulk thalamus)20SAGE normal spinal cord18SAGE normal pool (6th) (brain normal)15SAGE normal liver14SAGE normal heart11SAGE BB542 whitematter (brain normal)10 Open table in a new tab Genomic Organization, Chromosomal Localization, and Tissue Distribution of EndoPDI—The putative full-length gene encoding EndoPDI has been found in genome databases (accession no. BD127641) and mapped to human chromosome 6 at position 6p25.2. This region of chromosome 6 also encodes another molecule containing thioredoxin-like domains called PICOT (20Witte S. Villalba M. Bi K. Liu Y. Isakov N. Altman A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1902-1909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). We performed RNase protection analysis to examine the expression of EndoPDI in vitro in ten different cell types (Fig. 2). As expected, EndoPDI expression was highest in endothelial cells. The other cell lines tested were MRC-5 (fibroblast), SY-SH-SY (neuroblastoma), SK23 (skin fibroblast), MDA468 (breast carcinoma), NCIH520 (squamous lung carcinoma), ZR75 (estrogen-dependent breast carcinoma), and HL60 (promyelocytic leukemia). We found that EndoPDI expression was greatest in large vessel endothelial cells (HUVEC) compared with microvascular endothelial cells (HDMEC), with the immortalized cell line HMME displaying the lowest expression among the endothelial cells. The promyelocytic leukemia cell line, HL60 displayed a 2.5-fold higher expression of EndoPDI than MDA468, the next highest expressing cell line. Expression of EndoPDI in HL60 may reflect the common cell lineage of hematopoetic and endothelial cells in that both originate from hemangioblasts in the embryonic blood islands. The expression of EndoPDI in the remaining 6 cell lines was at least 4-fold lower than in endothelial cells. Tissue Expression Array Studies—Human multiple tissue expression arrays were used to determine the relative expression of EndoPDI mRNA in human tissues (Fig. 3A). The blots contained poly(A)+ RNA from 72 different human tissues. EndoPDI was detected in 20 of 72 tissue spots. The highest levels were found in lymph node, followed by stomach then heart. The high expression in the stomach was unexpected since the stomach is not a particularly well vascularized organ, and in light of the hypoxic induction of EndoPDI described later, not known to be hypoxic. Arrays containing tissue from matched tumor and normal tissue samples were used to determine whether EndoPDI is up-regulated in human tumors (Fig. 3B). Up-regulation of endoPDI was found in tumors of the cervix, uterus, stomach, and lung. In Situ Hybridization Studies—In situ hybridization studies were performed in order to define expression of EndoPDI in human tissues in vivo (Fig. 4). Expression was found to be rare and seen only in the vasculature of human melanoma (A–D), the syncytiotrophoblasts of placenta (E and F), in macrophages and the microvasculature of the atherosclerotic plaque (G and H) and in the keratinocytes of a hair follicle (I and J). EndoPDI Is Up-regulated by Hypoxia in HDMEC—We next investigated whether EndoPDI is regulated by hypoxia. Using RNase protection analysis we found that EndoPDI is 2-fold up-regulated after 1 h hypoxia in HDMEC with a maximal 2.5-fold induction after 16 h hypoxia (Fig. 5A). Western analysis confirmed the protein to be 3-fold up-regulated by hypoxia (Fig. 5B). Loss of EndoPDI Causes Increased Apoptotic Cell Death in Microvascular Endothelial Cells in Hypoxia but Not Normoxia—Since the up-regulation of PDI has been previously shown to have a protective effect against apoptotic cell death induced by hypoxia in neuronal cells (21Tanaka S. Uehara T. Nomura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10388-10393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), we investigated whether EndoPDI has a role in protecting endothelial cells from apoptosis under hypoxia. The approach we used was to down-regulate EndoPDI expression using specific siRNA oligos. The siRNA efficiently down-regulated EndoPDI mRNA (Fig. 6A) and protein (Fig. 6B). Cells were treated with either transfection reagents alone, EndoPDI-specific siRNA, or scrambled siRNA. Scrambled siRNA is siRNA that contains the same overall nucleotide composition as the gene-specific siRNA but has no homology to any known genes according to BLAST search results. We found that under normoxia, HDMEC that had been treated with transfection reagents alone (control) or with scrambled oligos expressed the same level of EndoPDI mRNA and protein, and this expression was completely blocked after transfection with EndoPDI-specific siRNA (Fig. 6). Similar results were observed when the cells were subjected to 16 h hypoxia (0.1% O2) in that the expression level of EndoPDI mRNA and protein was unaffected by treatment with scrambled siRNA (Fig. 6). Again under hypoxia, there was loss of EndoPDI expression after transfection with siRNA specific to EndoPDI. We used the same approach to down-regulate the expression of PDI using siRNA oligos specific to PDI. As with EndoPDI, we found that HDMEC treated with siRNA to PDI had lost PDI protein expression under both normoxia and hypoxia (Fig. 6C). We used siRNA to examine the effect of down-regulation of EndoPDI on HDMEC survival under hypoxia. We found that down-regulation of EndoPDI under normoxia had no effect on HDMEC survival (Fig. 7A). However, when HDMEC were treated with EndoPDI siRNA under hypoxia there was a significant increase in the apoptotic and necrotic cell populations (Fig. 7B). Loss of PDI Causes Increases Apoptotic Cell Death in Microvascular Endothelial Cells in Both Normoxia and Hypoxia— The effect of EndoPDI on endothelial cell behavior was compared with that of PDI. Using PDI-specific siRNA to down-regulate PDI, we performed FACS analysis to determine the extent of apoptosis resulting from the loss of PDI (Fig. 8). In contrast to EndoPDI, we found that loss of PDI caused a high level of apoptosis in normoxia as well as under hypoxia. In fact, under the same conditions, PDI down-regulation resulted in 55 and 48% of the cell population being apoptotic in normoxia and hypoxia, respectively, whereas 12% of the cell population was apoptotic under hypoxia after down-regulation of EndoPDI and only 4.5% apoptotic under normoxia. The Effect of Lack of EndoPDI and PDI Expression on the Secretion or Cell Surface Expression of Hypoxically Induced Endothelial Survival Factors—Under hypoxia, endothelial cells produce a number of molecules that act as hypoxia survival factors. Examples of such molecules are endothelin-1 (22Shichiri M. Kato H. Marumo F. Hirata Y. Hypertension. 1997; 30: 1198-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) adrenomedullin (23Oehler M.K.

The tumor suppressor gene p53 encodes a transcription factor that controls the expression of a number of genes, the products of which mediate either cell cycle arrest or apoptosis (1Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6727) Google Scholar). Because of this growth inhibitory activity, under most physiological conditions, p53 is kept at low levels through rapid protein degradation, which ensures cell survival and proper organ development. p53 turnover is mediated primarily by MDM2, an E3 1The abbreviations used are: E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; MEF, mouse embryo fibroblasts; DKO, double knock-out; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP; RT, reverse transcriptase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; NES, nuclear export sequence; NLS, nuclear localization sequence; RNAi, RNA interference; RFD, Ring finger domain; Gy, grays.1The abbreviations used are: E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; MEF, mouse embryo fibroblasts; DKO, double knock-out; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP; RT, reverse transcriptase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; NES, nuclear export sequence; NLS, nuclear localization sequence; RNAi, RNA interference; RFD, Ring finger domain; Gy, grays. ubiquitin ligase, which targets p53 for ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal proteolysis, although non-proteasomal degradation may also play a role under certain conditions (2Vousden K.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1602: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). At the same time, MDM2 itself is a transcriptional target of p53, thus forming a negative feedback loop in which p53 controls the expression of its own negative regulator. The current model of p53 activation suggests that diverse stress signals converge on a single regulatory node, namely the p53-MDM2 module, and interfere with the ability of MDM2 to target p53 for degradation. Available evidence indicates that inhibition of MDM2-mediated p53 degradation can be achieved through two major mechanisms: either by preventing MDM2 from binding to p53 via DNA damage-induced phosphorylation or by functional inactivation of MDM2 through oncogene-induced expression of p14ARF (2Vousden K.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1602: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). MDMX is a close structural homologue of MDM2 (3Shvarts A. Steegenga W.T. Riteco N. van Laar T. Dekker P. Bazuine M. van Ham R.C. van der Houven van Oordt W. Hateboer G. van der Eb A.J. Jochemsen A.G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5349-5357Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Analogous to MDM2, it binds to p53 and inhibits its transactivation function. In contrast to MDM2, however, MDMX lacks ubiquitin E3 ligase activity in cells and is unable to target p53 for ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent proteolysis (4Stad R. Little N.A. Xirodimas D.P. Frenk R. van der Eb A.J. Lane D.P. Saville M.K. Jochemsen A.G. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 1029-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Interestingly, MDMX ablation is associated with p53-dependent embryonic death in mice (5Parant J. Chavez-Reyes A. Little N.A. Yan W. Reinke V. Jochemsen A.G. Lozano G. Nat.

MDM2 is an extremely unstable protein since it is capable of self-ubiquitination that leads to rapid proteasomal degradation (8Honda R. Yasuda H. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1473-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Regulation of MDM2 stability might therefore be another important mechanism by which p53 activity can be controlled. Indeed, we have recently shown that MDMX binds to and increases the stability of MDM2, thus directly contributing to the ability of MDM2 to maintain p53 at low levels (9Gu J. Kawai H. Nie L. Kitao H.

We demonstrate here that MDMX contributes to the regulation of DNA damage-induced p53 activation. In addition, our study identifies MDMX as a novel substrate of MDM2. Interestingly, MDM2 utilizes distinct mechanisms to target MDMX and p53 for degradation, therefore exerting differential control over the levels of these two proteins in response to DNA damage. Plasmid Design—p53, MDM2, MDMX, and MDM2 mutants and IκBα expression plasmids have been described previously (9Gu J. Kawai H. Nie L. Kitao H. Wiederschain D. Jochemsen A.G. Parant J. Lozano G.

MDMXRNAi was described previously (9Gu J. Kawai H. Nie L. Kitao H. Wiederschain D. Jochemsen A.G. Parant J. Lozano G. Yuan Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19251-19254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Transfection—MCF-7 cells (American Type Culture Collection), wild type MEFs, p53 -/- MEFs, and double knock-out (DKO) MEFs (p53 -/- MDM2 -/- MEFs) were maintained in minimal essential medium (Cellgro) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. HCT116 and HCT116-p53 -/- cells were maintained in McCoy's 5A medium (Cellgro). Cells were transfected by LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) method according to the manufacturer's instructions. Preparation of Whole Cell Extracts and Western Blot Analysis—Cells were transfected in 60-mm plates with 5 μg of DNA and harvested at 24 h after transfection. Cell lysates were prepared as described previously (12Kawai H. Wiederschain, D. Yuan Z.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4939-4947Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad). After the addition of 5× loading buffer, the samples were incubated at 95 °C for 5 min and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) and probed with the following antibodies as indicated: anti-MDMX (6B1A), anti-FLAG (M5; Sigma), anti-p53 (Ab-6; Oncogene), anti-MDM2 (Ab-1; Oncogene), anti-MDM2 (Ab-3; Oncogene), anti-p21 (187; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-actin (AC-15; Sigma), and anti-GFP (Clontech). Proteins were visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Preparation of Total RNA and Quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from MCF-7 cells using Trizol/chloroform extraction as directed by the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). RNA was then subjected to DNase treatment (DNAfree; Ambion) and purified according to the manufacturer's instructions using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). Quantitative RT-PCR was performed in two-step reactions: First, cDNA templates were created in final reaction conditions containing 2 μg of total RNA, 500 ng of oligo(dT), 100 ng of random hexamers, 0.5 mm dNTPs, 100 mm dithiothreitol, and 200 units of Superscript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Quantitative PCR reactions were performed using the QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions using specific primers (p53, 5′-aggccttggaactcaaggat-3′ and 5′-tgagtcaggcccttctgtct-3′; MDMX, 5′-agacgatatccccacactgc-3′ and 5′-tcccactcctcaaatccaag-3′; γ-actin, 5′-tccttcctgggtatggaatc-3′ and 5′-caccgtgttggcgtacag-3′). For each set of primer combinations, a standard curve was created to ensure similar efficiencies between PCR reactions. Each standard curve contained a “minus RT” reaction to ensure that there was no DNA contamination in the cDNA templates. 100 ng of cDNA template was used in the optimized PCR reactions for determining relative expression levels between MDMX and p53. Quantitative PCR reactions were carried out using the Opticon monitor thermocycler and analyzed using corresponding software (MJ Research, Inc.). Expression levels of MDMX and p53 following IR treatment were calculated relative to the γ-actin housekeeping gene. Cell Cycle Analysis—Cells were harvested by trypsinization, and after washing in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), the cells were fixed in 70% ethanol. Following PBS washes, cells were stained with propidium iodide solution (50 μg/ml) containing 100 μg/ml RNase A at 37 °C for 1 h, and DNA content of 10,000 cells was analyzed using Beckman-Coulter ELITE flow cytometer (Kresge Center for Environmental Health Sciences, Harvard School of Public Health) and Multicycle cell cycle analysis software (Phoenix Flow Systems). Retrovirus Infection—Phoenix Ampho Φ cells were transfected with pMSCV-FLAG MDMX (10 μg), pCG-gagpol (5 μg), and pCG-VSVG (1 μg) (Dr. R. Mulligan, Harvard Medical School) by calcium-phosphate method as described previously (9Gu J. Kawai H. Nie L. Kitao H. Wiederschain D. Jochemsen A.G. Parant J. Lozano G. Yuan Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19251-19254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Retroviral supernatant was harvested 48 h after transfection. HCT116 and HCT116-p53 -/- cells were infected by incubation with retroviral supernatants and polybrene (4 μg/ml) for 24 h followed by selection in puromycin (1.5 μg/ml)-containing media for 5 days. Immunoprecipitation Analysis—Immunoprecipitations were performed as described elsewhere (9Gu J. Kawai H. Nie L. Kitao H. Wiederschain D. Jochemsen A.G. Parant J. Lozano G. Yuan Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19251-19254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were prepared in 0.5% Triton X-100 lysis buffer and incubated with anti-MDMX antibody (p55 and p56) and Protein G PLUS-Agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 12 h. Immune complexes and whole lysates were analyzed by Western blotting. The filters were incubated with anti-MDMX (6B1A). Subcellular Distribution Assay—Cells were grown on Chamber Slides (Nunc) and transfected with the indicated FLAG-tagged vector. Cells were washed with PBS 24 h after transfection and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) for 30 min at 4 °C. After washing with PBS, cells were permeabilized with ice-cold 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min, blocked with 0.5% bovine serum albumin for 30 min, and then incubated with the indicated antibody for 1 h. The slides were incubated with secondary antibody (Texas-Red X goat anti-mouse IgG, Molecular Probes) and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (10 μg/ml, Sigma). Following PBS wash, the slides were mounted with Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotechnology Associates) containing 2.5 mg/ml n-propyl gallate (Sigma). Specimens were examined under the fluorescent microscope (Olympus). Contribution of MDMX to DNA Damage-induced p53 Activation—Having recently identified mutual dependence of MDM2 and MDMX in their functional inactivation of p53 in non-stressed cells (9Gu J. Kawai H. Nie L. Kitao H. Wiederschain D. Jochemsen A.G. Parant J. Lozano G. Yuan Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19251-19254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), we asked whether MDMX plays any role in DNA damage-induced p53 activation when the ability of MDM2 to target p53 for degradation is inhibited. Response of MCF-7 cells to IR was analyzed by Western blot using the indicated antibodies (Fig. 1A). As expected, p53 protein levels were readily induced by IR followed by the induction of p21 and MDM2 (Fig. 1A). In sharp contrast to the p53 induction, IR caused a marked decrease in endogenous MDMX levels over time. Significant and dose-dependent down-regulation of MDMX was further confirmed as a novel molecular event in response to IR in a separate experiment, as shown in Fig. 1B. To determine whether this decrease in MDMX abundance was due to either decreased protein synthesis or increased protein degradation, proteasome inhibitor MG132 was added to the culture immediately following IR treatment. Measurement of cellular levels of MDMX revealed that the addition of proteasome inhibitor almost completely blocked the IR-induced reduction in MDMX protein (Fig. 1C). Together with the failure to detect any significant effect of the dose of IR used on MDMX mRNA level (Fig. 1E), these results suggest that IR induces MDMX down-regulation via an increased proteolysis. Interestingly, in contrast to p53 accumulation, the addition of proteasome inhibitor to non-stressed cells did not result in detectable alteration in MDMX levels (Fig. 1D), suggesting that MDMX degradation is triggered by DNA damage. To substantiate this notion, we determined the half-life of MDMX in MCF-7 cells exposed to IR, as well as in mock-treated cells. We utilized cyclohexamide to inhibit de novo protein synthesis and monitored the disappearance of MDMX, MDM2, and p53 by Western blot analysis at the indicated time points (Fig. 1F). Although MDMX is a rather stable protein in non-stressed cells, the half-life of MDMX was markedly shortened in IR-treated cells, indicating that a decrease in MDMX levels is the result of IR-induced protein degradation. Notably, the shortened half-life of MDM2 and prolonged half-life of p53 tightly correlated with IR-induced MDMX degradation (Fig. 1F). Since various forms of genotoxic stress can activate p53, there are likely to be multiple modes of p53 induction. To determine whether down-regulation of MDMX is specific for IR or reflects a general response to DNA damage, we tested the response of MCF-7 cells to either UV irradiation (Fig. 1G, lanes 1-4) or adriamycin (Fig. 1G, lanes 5-8) treatment. Western analysis of the cell lysates prepared at the indicated times after treatment revealed significant reductions in MDMX levels in response to both UV and adriamycin treatment, although it was slightly delayed when compared with IR-treated cells. Once again, MDMX down-regulation was associated with p53 activation. Analogous to IR-induced MDMX degradation, the proteasome inhibitor blocked MDMX disappearance in UV- and adriamycin-treated cells (Fig. 1G, lanes 9-16). Strong correlation between p53 induction and MDMX decrease in response to IR prompted us to ask whether this MDMX down-regulation is important to p53 activation. To address this, we transiently expressed exogenous MDMX to counteract MDMX decline induced by DNA damage. Western analysis demonstrated that p53 activation in response to IR was severely compromised in MDMX-expressing cells, as evidenced by the significantly diminished induction of p53 target gene products p21 and MDM2 (Fig. 2A, lanes 4-6). To test whether this MDMX-dependent suppression of p53 activation can translate into impaired biological response, DNA damage-induced G1 cell cycle arrest was analyzed. Comparison of the S-phase population between control and IR-treated cells indicated that sustained MDMX expression resulted in impaired G1 arrest induced by IR (Fig. 2B). To further examine the MDMX-dependent p53 regulation, MCF-7 cells deficient in MDMX expression were generated by RNAi-mediated gene silencing. Consistent with our previous results (9Gu J. Kawai H. Nie L. Kitao H. Wiederschain D. Jochemsen A.G. Parant J. Lozano G. Yuan Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19251-19254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), inhibition of MDMX expression was associated with partial p53 activation, as demonstrated by elevated p53 and p21 levels in RNAi transfected cells (Fig. 2C, lane 4). Importantly, IR exposure resulted in greater p53 activation in MDMX-deficient cells than in control cells (Fig. 2C, lanes 2 and 3 versus lanes 5 and 6). Cell cycle analysis further demonstrated that MDMX deficiency is associated with p53 functional activation (Fig. 2D). IR-induced MDMX Down-regulation Is Mediated by MDM2—Having shown that exposure of MCF-7 cells to DNA damage agents results in the increased degradation of the MDMX protein, we went on to examine the underlying mechanism. Since our results demonstrate that MDMX is degraded through the proteasomal pathway (Fig. 1), and given the fact that MDMX binds to MDM2, which possesses an E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, we asked whether MDM2 could target MDMX for degradation. MCF-7 cells deficient in MDM2 expression were generated using RNAi. Since MDM2 expression is transcriptionally controlled by p53, efficient reduction in MDM2 levels required the use of both p53RNAi and MDM2RNAi. We first tested each RNAi for its ability to inhibit the expression of the corresponding gene and evaluated its effect on p53 activity. RNAi-mediated suppression of either MDMX (Fig. 3A, lane 2) or MDM2 (Fig. 3A, lane 4) expression resulted in p53 activation as evidenced by the induction of p21. In contrast, p53RNAi effectively reduced endogenous p53 levels, leading to down-regulation of p21 and MDM2 (Fig. 3A, lane 3). Combination of MDM2RNAi and p53RNAi inhibited the expression of both genes (Fig. 3A, lane 5). Significantly, MDMX levels remained constant following IR treatment in cells transfected with both MDM2RNAi and p53RNAi (Fig. 3B, lanes 4-6, top panel). To determine whether p53 contributes to the IR-induced MDMX reduction, we utilized p53-wild type or p53-null HCT116 cell lines retrovirally transduced with MDMX that had comparable levels of MDM2 under non-stressed conditions. Our results demonstrate that IR-induced MDMX degradation is p53-independent as both p53-wild type and p53-null HCT116 cells exhibited almost identical decrease in MDMX in response to IR (Fig. 3C, lanes 1-3 versus lanes 4-6). To further verify that MDMX levels are controlled by MDM2, we analyzed IR-induced response in p53-null HCT116 cells in which MDM2 expression was inhibited by MDM2RNAi. Western analysis indicated that deficiency in MDM2 was indeed associated with the resistance of MDMX to IR-induced degradation (Fig. 3D). Finally, MEFs isolated from wild type, p53 knock-out, or p53-MDM2 DKO mice were used to confirm the results obtained in RNAi experiments. As shown in Fig. 3E, IR exposure resulted in marked MDMX reduction in wild type and p53 -/- MEFs, but not in DKO MEFs (Fig. 3E), thus confirming that IR-induced MDMX down-regulation depends on MDM2, but not on p53. We next tested whether MDM2, which has an E3 ligase activity, could target MDMX for ubiquitination/degradation. To accomplish this, MDMX-expressing plasmid was co-transfected with either control vector or MDM2 expressing vector into DKO MEFs. Plasmids encoding p53 and IκBα were included as controls. Western analysis of cellular protein abundance at 24 h after transfection indicated that, as expected, MDM2 targeted p53, but not IκBα, for efficient degradation (Fig. 4A, lanes 1 and 2 versus lanes 5 and 6). Significantly, coexpression of MDM2 also resulted in a significant reduction in MDMX protein abundance (Fig. 4A, lanes 3 and 4). Anti-Actin and anti-GFP blots demonstrate that the observed difference in protein levels was not a result of unequal loading or transfection efficiency. Since the E3 ligase activity of MDM2 is essential to target p53 for degradation, we proceeded to test whether the Ring domain mutant of MDM2 (MDM2RM, C464A), which lacks the E3 ligase activity, is capable of down-regulating MDMX. Our data show that the E3 ligase-deficient MDM2 mutant completely lost its ability to reduce MDMX levels (Fig. 4B, lane 2 versus lane 3). To further analyze the MDM2-targeted MDMX degradation, we asked whether the steady state levels of MDMX could be affected by MDM2. To this end, the half-life of MDMX was determined in the presence of either wild type MDM2 or the Ring domain mutant of MDM2. We monitored the disappearance of MDMX as well as MDM2 by Western blot analysis in cyclohexamide-treated cells. DKO MEFs expressing the indicated vectors were analyzed at 0, 30, 60, 120, and 180 min following the addition of cyclohexamide. Substantially prolonged half-life of MDMX in the MDM2RM-expressing cells when compared with the wild type MDM2-transfected cells (Fig. 4C) supports an E3 ligase-dependent regulation of MDMX protein stability by MDM2. MDM2 is a shuttling protein that contains both the nuclear localization sequence (NLS) and the nuclear export sequence (NES). Our previous finding that MDMX is in fact a cytoplasmic protein which redistributes into the nucleus upon binding to MDM2 (9Gu J. Kawai H. Nie L. Kitao H. Wiederschain D. Jochemsen A.G. Parant J. Lozano G. Yuan Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19251-19254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 10Migliorini D. Danovi D. Colombo E. Carbone R. Pelicci P.G. Marine J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 13: 13Google Scholar) led us to ask whether subcellular distribution plays a role in the MDM2-targeted MDMX degradation. MDM2 mutants deficient in either nuclear import or nuclear export were tested for their ability to degrade MDMX. Although mainly cytoplasmically localized when expressed alone, coexpression with MDM2 mutants caused MDMX to colocalize with the MDM2 protein either in the nucleus (MDM2ΔNES) or in the cytoplasm (MDM2ΔNLS) (Fig. 4D). Western analysis revealed that coexpression of either MDM2 mutant was associated with a marked decrease in cellular MDMX levels (Fig. 4E), regardless of distribution, indicating that the MDM2-mediated MDMX degradation is independent of its subcellular localization. The inverse correlation between DNA damage-induced p53 induction and MDMX down-regulation suggests the possibility that MDM2 might target MDMX for degradation by a mechanism that is distinct from p53 degradation. Since recent studies have shown that the Ring finger domain (RFD) of MDM2 is necessary but not sufficient for p53 degradation (11Fang S. Jensen J.P. Ludwig R.L. Vousden K.H. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8945-8951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar), we asked whether it was also the case for MDMX down-regulation. Having recently demonstrated that the E3 ligase activity of MDM2 is transferable to MDMX via fusion of the MDM2RFD into MDMX backbone (12Kawai H. Wiederschain, D. Yuan Z.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4939-4947Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), we assessed the ability of MDM2RFD- or MDM2ZnRFD-bearing chimeric proteins to degrade MDMX. Consistent with our recent data (12Kawai H. Wiederschain, D. Yuan Z.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4939-4947Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), these MDMX-MDM2 chimeras were unable to target p53 for degradation as no detectable reduction in p53 levels was seen in chimera-expressing cells, whereas p53 levels were significantly diminished in the wild type MDM2-expressing cells (Fig. 5A, lane 2 versus lanes 3 and 4). Interestingly, the MDMX protein was markedly decreased by coexpression with MDM2 as well as with MDMX-MDM2 chimeras (Fig. 5A, lane 5 versus lanes 6-8). Consistent with the involvement of the zinc motif in binding to MDMX (13Sharp D.A. Kratowicz S.A. Sank M.J. George D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38189-38196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), the MDMX-MDM2ZnRFD exhibited greater potency in MDMX degradation than MDMX chimera that contained only the RFD of MDM2 (Fig. 5A, lane 7 versus lane 8). In a parallel experiment, the acidic domain deletion mutant of MDM2 (MDM2Δ222-302) was tested for its ability to target MDMX for degradation. Wild type MDM2 and MDM2RM were included as controls. Measurement of cellular MDMX abundance revealed that MDM2Δ222-302 was just as efficient as wild type MDM2 in targeting MDMX for degradation, whereas the MDM2RM had no effect on MDMX levels (Fig. 5B). Similarly, ubiquitinated forms of MDMX were observed in cells expressing either wild type MDM2 or MDM2Δ222-302, but not MDM2RM (Fig. 5B, top panel). Finally, to test whether the MDM2ZnRFD is sufficient for targeting MDMX for degradation, plasmid encoding the corresponding sequence of MDM2 was coexpressed with MDMX. Our data show that this E3 ligase containing mini-protein is indeed sufficient to degrade MDMX, albeit with reduced potency (Fig. 5C, lane 2 versus lane 3), whereas not having any effect on p53 levels (Fig. 5C, lane 5 versus lane 6). Taken together, our results demonstrate that the C terminus of MDM2 is necessary and sufficient to target MDMX for ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent proteolysis. Available evidence indicates that inhibition of MDM2-mediated p53 degradation is essential for adequate p53 activation in response to various forms of genotoxic stress. Two major pathways of p53 activation have been well documented: phosphorylation-dependent disruption of p53-MDM2 complex upon DNA damage and oncogene-induced MDM2 inactivation by p14ARF. We demonstrate here that an additional layer of regulation of p53 activation in response to stress is present in the intricate interplay between MDMX and MDM2. Biochemical analysis has demonstrated that MDMX expression is necessary to render MDM2 sufficiently stable so that it can function at its full potential (9Gu J. Kawai H. Nie L. Kitao H. Wiederschain D. Jochemsen A.G. Parant J. Lozano G. Yuan Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19251-19254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In non-stressed cells, MDMX forms heterocomplex with MDM2, resulting in enhanced MDM2 protein stability and thus ensuring low p53 levels. Upon DNA damage, as our data show, MDMX is rapidly degraded via a MDM2-dependent mechanism, which leads to optimal p53 activation. Indeed, restoration of MDMX expression suppresses DNA damage-induced p53 activation, whereas down-regulation of MDMX is associated with p53 activation. It is particularly interesting that the DNA damage-induced MDMX down-regulation is mediated by MDM2 that targets MDMX for ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent proteolysis. However, MDM2 directs p53 and MDMX into the degradation pathway through distinct mechanisms. Although sufficient for MDMX degradation, the Ring domain of MDM2 is necessary but not sufficient for p53 destruction. This difference may represent a key mechanism by which DNA damage differentially modulates MDM2-mediated p53 and MDMX degradation. Our results demonstrate that in contrast to the significantly prolonged half-life of p53 in IR-treated cells, MDMX is rapidly degraded by MDM2 following stress. Therefore, MDMX down-regulation inversely correlates with p53 induction, thus ensuring rapid and maximal p53 activation. Although the importance of phosphorylation in DNA damage-induced p53 activation has been well documented, it has also been shown that a phosphorylation-resistant mutant of p53 can still be readily induced by DNA damage (14Ashcroft M. Kubbutat M.H. Vousden K.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1751-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), suggesting the presence of an alternative mechanism for p53 activation. The intricate interplay between MDM2 and MDMX, as demonstrated in this study, represents a novel mode of DNA damage-induced p53 activation. We are grateful to Dr. A.

Recently, a cell culture system in which the HCV subgenomic replicon is efficiently replicated and maintained for a long period in Huh-7 cells has been established. Taking advantage of this replicon system, we detected the activity to synthesize the subgenomic RNA in the digitonin-permeabilized replicon cells. To elucidate how and where this viral RNA replicates in the cells, we monitored the activity for HCV RNA synthesis in the permeabilized replicon cells under several conditions. We obtained results suggesting that HCV replication complexes functioning to synthesize the replicon RNA are protected from access of nuclease and proteinase by possible cellular lipid membranes. We also found that a large part of the replicon RNA, including newly synthesized RNA, was present in such a membranous structure but a large part of each NS protein was not. A small part of each NS protein that was resistant to the proteinase action was shown to contribute sufficiently to the synthesis of HCV subgenomic RNA in the permeabilized replicon cells. These results suggested that a major subcellular site of HCV genome replication is probably compartmentalized by lipid membranes and that only a part of each NS protein forms the active replication complex in the replicon cells.

Infection of hepatitis C virus (HCV) 1The abbreviations used are: HCVhepatitis C virusNSnon-structuralERendoplasmic reticulumDHFRdihydrofolate reductase.1The abbreviations used are: HCVhepatitis C virusNSnon-structuralERendoplasmic reticulumDHFRdihydrofolate reductase. is estimated to occur in about 3% of the worlds population. HCV infection frequently causes chronic hepatitis, which often leads to the development of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma after a long period (1.Liang T.J. Jeffers L.J. Reddy K.R.

Current combination therapy with interferon-α and ribavirin, a nucleotide analogue, is effective in many patients with chronic hepatitis C (4.Fried M.W. Hoofnagle J.H. Semin.

Therefore, extensive studies have been performed to develop highly effective anti-HCV drugs. Such a drug, however, has not been produced yet, possibly because of the lack of detailed information about the life cycle of this virus.HCV is a member of the Flaviviridae family and contains a single-strand RNA genome of positive polarity (6.Kato N.

The RNA genome is ∼9.6 kb in length and consists of a 5′-untranslated region of 341 nucleotides, a large open reading frame encoding a single precursor polyprotein of ∼3000 amino acids, and a 3′-untranslated region of variable length (6.Kato N.

The polyprotein is processed by the host and viral proteinases to generate at least 10 functional viral proteins: core (C), envelope (E) 1, E2, p7, non-structural protein (NS) 2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B (from the amino- to the carboxyl-terminal) (9.Hijikata M.

C, E1, and E2 are believed to form viral particles as structural proteins. p7 was recently reported to form an ion channel-like structure (13.Griffin S.D. Beales L.P. Clarke D.S. Worsfold O.

NS molecules have been considered to function in the replication of HCV subgenomic RNA (15.Lohmann V. Korner F. Koch J. Herian U. Theilmann L. Bartenschlager R. Science. 1999; 285: 110-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (2480) Google Scholar). Using recombinant proteins produced in either bacterial or insect cells, the proteinase and helicase activities of NS3 and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity of NS5B have been biochemically characterized (16.Behrens S.E.

However, it was not clear whether these recombinant proteins function in HCV genomic replication as it has been revealed that HCV genomic sequences are highly variable among all isolates and furthermore, it is unclear whether the genes for these viral enzymes were derived from infectious HCV genomes.Recently, HCV subgenomic RNA that replicates efficiently and is maintained for a long period in the human hepatoma cell line Huh-7 was developed and called the HCV subgenomic replicon (15.Lohmann V. Korner F. Koch J. Herian U. Theilmann L. Bartenschlager R. Science. 1999; 285: 110-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (2480) Google Scholar). Functional replicons originating from different HCV isolates have been reported (15.Lohmann V. Korner F. Koch J. Herian U. Theilmann L. Bartenschlager R.

Virol. 2003; 77: 3181-3190Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The HCV subgenomic RNA was constructed by replacing the structural and part of the non-structural protein-encoding regions (C-NS2) of the HCV genome with the neomycin phosphotransferase gene (neor) and an internal ribosome entry site of encephalomyocarditis virus (21.Kishine H. Sugiyama K. Hijikata M. Kato N. Takahashi H. Noshi T. Nio Y. Hosaka M. Miyanari Y. Shimotohno K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 993-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This implies that HCV proteins encoded in this subgenomic RNA (NS3-NS5B) are functional and sufficient for this RNA replication. In this model system, it has been suggested that mutations of particular amino acids in the NS region enhanced the efficiency of the replication (24.Lohmann V. Korner F. Dobierzewska A. Bartenschlager R. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 1437-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 25.Blight K.J. Kolykhalov A.A. Rice C.M.

Virol. 2003; 77: 3007-3019Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). It was also demonstrated that the existence of the cis-acting elements in either the 5′- or 3′-untranslated regions were required for efficient replication (27.Lohmann V. Hoffmann S. Herian U. Penin F. Bartenschlager R. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 3007-3019Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 28.Friebe P. Lohmann V. Krieger N. Bartenschlager R. J.

Recent observations indicated that the replication of the replicon RNA could be reproduced in vitro using particular cellular fractions from replicon cells (30.Ali N. Tardif K.D. Siddiqui A. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 12001-12007Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 31.Lai V.C. Dempsey S. Lau J.Y. Hong Z. Zhong W. J.

Virol. 2003; 77: 2029-2037Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). It remains, however, to be elucidated how and where the HCV RNA is synthesized in the cells. So, we intended to clarify these points using digitonin-treated replicon cells of which plasma membranes were permeabilized. This permeabilized cell system is often used to monitor several cellular events, such as a nuclear protein transport as well as replication of positive-strand RNA viruses.Cell biological and biochemical analyses have demonstrated that all HCV NS proteins are directly or indirectly associated with inner cellular membranes and colocalize on the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes (33.Tanji Y.

So, we expected the active HCV replication complexes to be retained on the inner cellular membranes in permeabilized replicon cells. In this paper, we report that the functional replication complexes are retained in permeabilized replicon cells and its activity is easily detected by using this system. We also obtained data suggesting that a part of each NS protein in the cells, which is probably located in a membranous compartment, forms the active replication complex and contributes to the synthesis of HCV subgenomic RNA.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Cultures—The human hepatoma cell line Huh-7 was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen), and 100 μg/ml penicillin and streptomycin sulfate (Invitrogen). MH-14 cells were cultured in the same medium with 500 μg/ml G418 (GENETICIN, Invitrogen).Sequencing Analysis—The nucleotide sequence of the HCV subgenomic replicon RNA in MH-14 cells was determined by reverse transcription-PCR-based DNA sequencing as described previously (21.Kishine H. Sugiyama K. Hijikata M. Kato N. Takahashi H. Noshi T. Nio Y. Hosaka M. Miyanari Y. Shimotohno K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 993-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar).Plasmid Construction—The plasmid pGEM-NN was constructed by inserting the cDNA fragment of the subgenomic replicon from pNNRZ2 (21.Kishine H. Sugiyama K. Hijikata M. Kato N. Takahashi H. Noshi T. Nio Y. Hosaka M. Miyanari Y. Shimotohno K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 993-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) into the TA site of pGEM-T-Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The cDNA fragment was obtained by PCR using the oligonucleotides 5′-GCCAGCCCCCGATTGGGGGCGACAC-3′ and 5′-ACATGATCTGCAGAGAGGCCAG-3′ and the plasmid pNNRZ2 as primers and a template, respectively.In Vitro Transcription—pGEM-NN was linearized with PvuI or SpeI for plus or minus strand subgenomic HCV RNA synthesis, respectively, and used as a template for in vitro RNA synthesis with MEGA script Sp6 or T7 kit (Ambion, Austin, TX), respectively.Preparation of RNA and Northern Blot Analysis—RNA was extracted from cells and a reaction mixture with Sepasol RNA I and II super reagent (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan), respectively, according to the manufacturer's protocol. Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously (37.Hijikata M. Kato N. Sato T. Kagami Y. Shimotohno K. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 4632-4639Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the preparation of the 32P-labeled probe, the EcoRI fragment of pNNRZ2 was labeled with a Ready-to-Go DNA labeling beads (-dCTP) kit (Amersham Biosciences) in the presence of 50 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Biosciences).Western Blotting—The preparation of the cell lysate, SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting were performed as previously described (10.Hijikata M. Mizushima H. Akagi T. Mori S. Kakiuchi N. Kato N. Tanaka T. Kimura K. Shimotohno K. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4665-4675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The antibodies used in the immunoblotting were those against HCV NS3, NS4A (α-NS4A), NS4B (NS4B-52), NS5A (α-NS5A), NS5B (NS5B-14) (21.Kishine H. Sugiyama K. Hijikata M. Kato N. Takahashi H. Noshi T.

Kohara (Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science).Indirect Immunofluorescence—Indirect immunofluorescence analysis was essentially performed as described previously (38.Marusawa H. Hijikata M. Chiba T. Shimotohno K. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 4713-4720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with minor modifications. 1.0 × 105 cells were seeded on poly-l-lysine (Sigma)-coated coverslips. Three days post-seeding, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, and 1.4 mm KH2PO4) for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were treated with pre-chilled 100% methanol for 10 min at –20 °C after the fixation. In the case of permeabilized cells, permeabilization with digitonin followed by washing with buffer B (see below) was performed before or after fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde and then the cells were permeabilized completely with chilled 100% methanol after fixation. The antibodies against NS5A (α-NS5A), NS5B (NS5B-12), and protein-disulfide isomerase (StressGen) were used as primary antibodies. NS5B-12 was a gift from Dr. M. Kohara (Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science). The fluorescent secondary antibodies were Alexa 568 goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) and Alexa 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) conjugates (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The nucleus was visualized by staining with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. All imaging experiments were performed on a Leica SP2 confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Germany).Cell Permeabilization and Synthesis of HCV Subgenomic RNA— Cells of about 80% confluency in 12- or 6-well plates were precultured in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5 μg/ml actinomycin D (Nacalai Tesque) for 2 h, then washed with cold buffer B: 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.7 at 27 °C), 110 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm EGTA, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. The cells were permeabilized by incubation in buffer B containing 50 μg/ml digitonin for 5 min at 27 °C and the reaction was stopped by washing twice with cold buffer B. The permeabilized cells were, then, incubated for 4 h at 27 °C in the labeling reaction mixture: 2 mm manganese(II) chloride, 1 mg/ml acetylated bovine serum albumin (Nacalai Tesque), 5 mm phosphocreatine (Sigma), 20 units/ml creatine phosphokinase (Sigma), 50 μg/ml actinomycin D, 500 μm ATP, CTP, and GTP (Roche Diagnostics), and 10 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (Amersham Biosciences) in buffer B (pH 7.7), for 4 h at 27 °C unless otherwise specified. The reaction was terminated by the addition of Sepasol RNA I or II super reagent.For the treatments with microccocal nuclease and/or Nonidet P-40, the permeabilized cells were pre-washed twice with buffer D: 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.7 at 27 °C), 110 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm CaCl2. Then the permeabilized cells were incubated in buffer D containing 0.1 unit/ml microccocal nuclease (United States Biochemical Corp.), with or without 0.5% Nonidet P-40 for 15 min at 37 °C or 0.5% Nonidet P-40 for 15 min on ice.Slot Blot Hybridization—RNA products synthesized in the permeabilized cells in the presence of 200 μCi of [α-32P]UTP were fractionated by denaturing agarose gel. The 8-kb RNA bands were eluted from the gel using RNade (BioOne, Carlsbad, CA). To increase the hybridization signal, the 32P-labeled 8-kb RNA eluted from the gel was subjected to alkaline hydrolysis to generate fragments of ∼250 nucleotides in length and used in hybridization. Newly synthesized replicon RNA in intact replicon cells was metabolically labeled by adding 1200 μCi of [32P]orthophosphate to the culture medium (see below) and handled in the same manner. For detection of plus and minus strand replicon RNA, minus and plus strand replicon RNA were prepared as riboprobes by in vitro transcription, respectively, as described above. Then 2 μg of each riboprobe was applied to a nylon membrane filter (Hybond-N, Ambion). Slot blot hybridization was performed as described previously (39.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), except that ULTRAhyb (Ambion) was used for hybridization buffer.Metabolic Labeling—For metabolic labeling of the replicon RNA, after a preculture in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 2% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 200 μg/ml G418, and 5 μg/ml actinomycin D for 2 h, 4 × 105 cells were cultured for 12 h in the same medium with 100 μCi of [32P]orthophosphate (Amersham Biosciences), as described previously (21.Kishine H. Sugiyama K. Hijikata M. Kato N. Takahashi H. Noshi T. Nio Y. Hosaka M. Miyanari Y. Shimotohno K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 993-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar).Proteinase K Treatment—After permeabilization of the replicon cells, the cells were scraped into 400 μl of cold buffer B and transferred to a siliconized tube. The cells were treated with various concentrations of proteinase K at 37 °C for 5 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and followed by trichloroacetic acid precipitation. The trichloroacetic acid precipitates were solubilized in 1× sample buffer containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and used in Western blotting analysis.RESULTSSelection of Replicon Cell Clones in Which Replicon RNA Efficiently Replicated—We reported the establishment of a cell clone, NN 50-1, in which HCV subgenomic replicon RNA originating from the HCV genome isolated from the cultured human T cell line MT-2C infected with HCV in vitro efficiently replicated (21.Kishine H. Sugiyama K. Hijikata M. Kato N. Takahashi H. Noshi T. Nio Y. Hosaka M. Miyanari Y. Shimotohno K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 993-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we obtained a cell clone, MH-14, in which the HCV subgenomic RNA level is nearly 5-fold higher than that in NN 50-1 (data not shown). Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that the replicon RNA in MH-14 cells bore two point mutations in the NS4B and NS5A encoding regions. One was a thymine to cytosine transition at nucleotide position 5985 (the number corresponds to the nucleotide number of the HCV genotype 1b genome) in the NS4B-encoding region without an amino acid substitution. Another was a cytosine to adenine transition at nucleotide 6953 in the NS5A-encoding region, resulting in the substitution of arginine for serine at amino acid position 2204. The substitution at amino acid 2204 has already been reported as one of the adaptive mutations enhancing the efficiency of viral replication (25.Blight K.J. Kolykhalov A.A. Rice C.M. Science. 2000; 290: 1972-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar). Then we used MH-14 cells, refereed as the replicon cells, in the following experiments to analyze the mechanism of HCV genomic replication.Replicon RNA and NS Proteins Were Retained in Digitonin-permeabilized Replicon Cells—Previous papers suggested that all HCV NS proteins are directly or indirectly associated with the inner cellular membranes, especially rough ER membranes, and form replication complexes on the membranes (10.Hijikata M. Mizushima H. Akagi T. Mori S. Kakiuchi N. Kato N. Tanaka T. Kimura K. Shimotohno K. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4665-4675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40.Egger D. Wolk B. Gosert R. Bianchi L. Blum H.E. Moradpour D. Bienz K. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 5974-5984Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). This suggested to us that functional HCV replication complexes could be retained in the replicon cells whose plasma membranes had been permeabilized with digitonin. To test this possibility, first, the fate of NS proteins in the replicon cells was investigated after digitonin treatment by Western blotting. In this experiment, ectopically expressed mouse DHFR was used as a cytoplasmic protein marker. After digitonin treatment, DHFR was not detected in the permeabilized cells (Fig. 1A, lanes 2 and 3), indicating that cytoplasmic soluble proteins were washed efficiently out of the cells under these conditions. On the other hand, HCV NS proteins (NS3-NS5B) were detected just like BiP/Grp78, an ER marker, in the permeabilized replicon cells as in the intact cells that were not treated with digitonin, as expected (Fig. 1A, lanes 2 and 3). Moreover, when we analyzed the RNA by Northern blotting, the retention of replicon RNA in the permeabilized replicon cells was observed (Fig. 1B, lanes 2 and 3). Treatment of the permeabilized replicon cells with the high salt buffer containing 2 m KCl did not greatly influence the amount of replicon RNA and NS proteins retained in the cells (data not shown). To investigate whether newly synthesized replicon RNA in the intact replicon cells was retained after permeabilization with digitonin, we performed metabolic labeling of the cells with [32P]orthophosphate. As shown in Fig. 1C, newly synthesized replicon RNA was detected after permeabilization (Fig. 1C, lane 3), although the amount was slightly decreased compared with that in the intact cells (Fig. 1C, lane 2). The localization of NS5A and NS5B in the permeabilized replicon cells was also analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence. These proteins were seen to accumulate around the perinuclear region and to be mostly colocalized with protein-disulfide isomerase, an ER marker, in the permeabilized replicon cells (Fig. 1D, panels i–p), just as in the intact replicon cells (Fig. 1D, panels a--h). This indicated that treatment with digitonin did not markedly affect subcellular localization of these proteins. From all of these results, it seemed likely that the replication complexes including replicon RNA were retained in the permeabilized replicon cells just like in the intact cells.The Replication Complexes in the Permeabilized Replicon Cells Functioned to Synthesize the HCV Subgenomic RNA—To see whether the replication complexes in the permeabilized replicon cells were active in HCV RNA synthesis, permeabilized or intact cells were incubated in reaction mixtures including [α-32P]UTP for 4 h. Actinomycin D, which showed no inhibitory effect on the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity of HCV NS5B (15.Lohmann V. Korner F. Koch J. Herian U. Theilmann L. Bartenschlager R. Science. 1999; 285: 110-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (2480) Google Scholar), was also added to the reaction mixture to inhibit the cellular activities of DNA-dependent DNA and RNA synthesis. After the reaction, total RNA of the cells and the reaction supernatants were extracted and analyzed by denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography. A radiolabeled product ∼8 kb in length, which was equivalent to the subgenomic replicon RNA in size, was found in RNA from the permeabilized replicon cells but not from Huh-7 cells (Fig. 2A, lanes 1–4). When overexposed, the 8-kb band became detectable in RNA sample from the intact replicon cells, although the signal was much lower than that from the permeabilized replicon cells (data not shown). This 8-kb product, however, was not detected in all the reaction supernatants (Fig. 2A, lanes 5–8). The radiolabeled 8-kb product was degradated by treatment with RNase A (data not shown), suggesting that it was HCV subgenomic RNA synthesized by the replication complexes in the permeabilized replicon cells. To examine whether the 8-kb RNA synthesized in the permeabilized cells was actually HCV subgenomic RNA, we performed slot blot hybridization analysis using each plus and minus strand HCV RNA synthesized in vitro as probes on the nylon membrane filter. After denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis, the radiolabeled 8-kb RNA derived from the permeabilized replicon cells was eluted from the gel and hybridized with the probes on the filter. Then the radioactivity hybridized with either the plus or minus strand-specific probe on the filter was detected by autoradiography (Fig. 2B, 8 kb RNA), whereas radiolabeled RNA prepared from permeabilized Huh-7 cells in the same way did not show any hybridization signals on the filter (data not shown). By the same procedure, we also confirmed that the metabolically radiolabeled 8-kb RNA in Fig. 1C was actually replicon RNA (data not shown). The ratio of plus to minus strand RNA synthesized in the permeabilized replicon cells was estimated to be 2.7 ± 0.4 (average ± S.D.) by three independent experiments. These results indicated that the radiolabeled 8-kb RNA was actually HCV subgenomic RNA synthesized in the permeabilized replicon cells and contained both plus and minus strands of the HCV RNA, implying that the functional HCV replication complexes were present in the permeabilized replicon cells.Fig. 2The activity for synthesis of the HCV subgenomic RNA was retained in the permeabilized replicon cells.A, the replicon cells (R; lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7) and the parental Huh-7 cells (H; lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8) were used in this experiment after treatment with (lanes 1, 2, 5, and 6) or without (lanes 3, 4, 7, and 8) digitonin. Total RNA extracted from the cell fraction (Cell), as well as the reaction supernatant (Sup), of these cells after incubation in the reaction mixtures for 4 h was analyzed by denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography. The 8-kb RNA specifically found in the cell fraction of replicon cells is indicated by an arrowhead. B, characterization of the radiolabeled 8-kb RNA synthesized in the permeabilized replicon cells.

However, whether it also has an intracellular function is still a matter of great debate. Overexpression of sphingosine kinase type 1, which generated S1P, induced extensive stress fibers and impaired formation of the Src-focal adhesion kinase signaling complex, with consequent aberrant focal adhesion turnover, leading to inhibition of cell locomotion. We have dissected biological responses dependent on intracellular S1P from those that are receptor-mediated by specifically blocking signaling of Gαq, Gαi, Gα12/13, and Gβγ subunits, the G proteins that S1P receptors (S1PRs) couple to and signal through. We found that intracellular S1P signaled “inside out” through its cell-surface receptors linked to G12/13-mediated stress fiber formation, important for cell motility. Remarkably, cell growth stimulation and suppression of apoptosis by endogenous S1P were independent of GPCRs and inside-out signaling. Using fibroblasts from embryonic mice devoid of functional S1PRs, we also demonstrated that, in contrast to exogenous S1P, intracellular S1P formed by overexpression of sphingosine kinase type 1 promoted growth and survival independent of its GPCRs. Hence, exogenous and intracellularly generated S1Ps affect cell growth and survival by divergent pathways. Our results demonstrate a receptor-independent intracellular function of S1P, reminiscent of its action in yeast cells that lack S1PRs.

In contrast, increasing intracellular levels of S1P in human breast cancer cells inhibits cell motility, leading us to suggest a possible role for intracellular S1P in inhibiting cell motility independent of its receptors (16Wang F.

In addition, expression of SphK1 in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts elevates intracellular levels of S1P, expedites the G1/S transition, and protects against apoptosis (21Olivera A. Kohama T. Edsall L.C. Nava V.

Because the involvement of S1PRs in these responses has not been conclusively ruled out and because intracellular targets of S1P have not yet been identified, whether S1P has direct intracellular effects remains controversial. Dissection of the intra- and extracellular actions of S1P is further complicated by the observation that binding of S1P to its receptors can stimulate SphK and generation of intracellular S1P (27Meyer zu Heringdorf D.

Moreover, tethering of the PDGFR with S1P1 may provide a platform for integrative signaling by these two types of receptors (30Alderton F. Rakhit S. Choi K.K. Palmer T. Sambi B. Pyne S. Pyne N.J. J.

On the other hand, S1P can specifically be transported into cells by the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator, a member of the ATP-binding cassette transporter family (31Boujaoude L.C.

In this study, we examined the effects of overexpression of SphK1 and elevated intracellular S1P while simultaneously blocking signaling of the heterotrimeric G proteins that S1PRs couple to and signal through, to dissect biological functions dependent on intracellular S1P from those mediated by S1PRs. Whereas SphK1 overexpression stimulated “inside-out” signaling leading to cytoskeleton rearrangement and stress fiber formation mediated by a S1PR coupled to Gα12/13, SphK1-promoted growth and survival were independent of S1PR signaling. Our results clearly demonstrate a receptor-independent intracellular function of S1P, reminiscent of its action in yeast and plants that lack S1PRs. Cell Culture and Transfections—NIH 3T3 fibroblasts (American Type Culture Collection CRL-1658) stably transfected with pcDNA3-SphK1 or empty vector were cultured as described previously (32Kohama T.

For transient transfections, NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were plated on collagen-coated dishes or coverslips and, after 16 h, transfected using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfection efficiencies were 30–40%. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were derived from embryonic day 14 embryos generated by wild-type or double knockout intercrosses of C57BL/6N mice as described previously (33Ishii I. Ye X.

MEFs were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Only cells from passages 2 to 4 were used for experiments.

Adhesion Assay—Six-well plates were coated with collagen I (0.1 mg/ml), fibronectin (0.5 mg/ml), polylysine (0.1 mg/ml), or Matrigel (1:10 dilution) and then incubated with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 30 min to block nonspecific binding sites, followed by extensive PBS washes. NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, harvested by scraping in PBS and 10 mm EDTA, were resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 3% BSA at 1 × 105 cells/ml. 2 × 105 cells were added to each well and then incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times. Nonadherent cells were removed, and attached cells were fixed in 70% ethanol for 20 min and stained with crystal violet. Incorporated dye was dissolved in 0.1 m sodium citrate in 50% ethanol (pH 4.2), and the absorbance was measured at 540 nm (34Wang F. Nohara K. Olivera A. Thompson E.W. Spiegel S. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 247: 17-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Western Blotting and Immunoprecipitation—Cells were plated in 100-mm dishes coated with 50 μg/ml collagen at 1.4 × 106 cells/dish. After the indicated treatments, cells were lysed for 10 min in buffer A (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1mm EDTA, 2 mm orthovanadate, 4 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin) and scraped off the plates. After centrifugation of the cell lysates for 15 min at 10,000 × g, equal amounts of the Triton X-100-insoluble and -soluble fractions were separated by 7 and 10% SDS-PAGE, respectively, and then transblotted onto nitrocellulose. Antibodies to paxillin and FAK (BD Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY); pan-c-Src (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA); phospho-Try418 Src, phospho-Tyr577 FAK, and phospho-Tyr397 FAK (BIOSOURCE); phospho-p38, p38, and phospho-ERK1/2 (New England Biolabs Inc); and PDGFR, vinculin, and phosphotyrosine (monoclonal antibody 4G10, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) were used as primary antibodies. Immunocomplexes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence as described (28Rosenfeldt H.M. Hobson J.P. Maceyka M. Olivera A. Nava V.E. Milstien S. Spiegel S. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2649-2659Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The blots shown are representative of at least three independent experiments. Where indicated, quantification of immunocomplexes was performed by densitometric scanning of the bands and integration with NIH Image software. Blots were further edited with Adobe PhotoShop Version 5.5 and/or Microsoft PowerPoint 2001 for Macintosh. For immunoprecipitation studies, cells were lysed in buffer A containing 0.5% deoxycholate and 0.1% SDS. 400 μg of the clarified lysates were incubated with 1–2 μg of anti-paxillin or anti-pan-Src antibodies at 4 °C overnight and then with protein A/G-Sepharose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) for an additional 1 h to capture immunocomplexes. After pelleting and washing by brief spins at 10,000 × g, the beads were resuspended in 2× sample buffer, and proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Immunostaining—Cells grown on glass coverslips coated with collagen I (50 μg/ml) were incubated overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 μg/ml transferrin and 20 μg/ml BSA. After treatment, cells were washed with PBS, fixed in 1.8% formalin and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 min, and then permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 10 min. Actin filaments were visualized with Alexa 488-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), and focal complexes were visualized with antibody to paxillin, followed by staining with Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibody. After washing three times with PBS, coverslips were mounted on slides using an anti-fade kit (Molecular Probes, Inc.), and >80 cells were examined with a confocal laser scanning microscope (Olympus Fluoview). All experiments were repeated at least three times. Rho Activation—Cytosolic extracts were incubated with freshly prepared glutathione S-transferase-rhotekin fusion protein bound to glutathione-agarose beads for 30 min at 4 °C. The bound proteins were separated by 15% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and blotted with anti-Rho antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). GTP-Rho was quantified using NIH Image software and normalized with total cellular Rho. Incorporation of Bromodeoxyuridine—Cells were plated on collagen-coated 5-cm2 coverslips at 2 × 105 cells and transfected the next day with the various constructs at a 5:1 ratio with green fluorescent protein (GFP). 24 h after transfection, NIH 3T3 cells were serum-starved in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 μg/ml transferrin and 20 μg/ml BSA for 8 h and then stimulated with various agents. Cells were incubated for 3 h with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd; 10 μm) and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde containing 5% sucrose (pH 7.0) for 20 min at room temperature. Nuclei incorporating BrdUrd were stained exactly as described (21Olivera A. Kohama T. Edsall L.C. Nava V. Cuvillier O. Poulton S. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 545-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Coverslips were mounted on slides, and cells expressing GFP and cells with positive BrdUrd staining were counted using a Zeiss fluorescence microscope. At least 400 cells were scored per point, which included at least four different randomly chosen fields. Staining of Apoptotic Nuclei—Apoptosis was assessed by staining cells with 8 μg/ml Hoechst dye in 30% glycerol and PBS for 10 min at room temperature as described previously (21Olivera A. Kohama T. Edsall L.C. Nava V. Cuvillier O. Poulton S. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 545-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Cells expressing GFP were examined with an inverted fluorescence microscope, and apoptotic cells were distinguished by condensed fragmented nuclear regions. The percentage of intact and apoptotic nuclei in cells expressing GFP fluorescence was determined. A minimum of 500 cells were scored in a double-blind manner. DNA Synthesis—[3H]Thymidine incorporation into DNA was measured as described (21Olivera A. Kohama T. Edsall L.C. Nava V. Cuvillier O. Poulton S. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 545-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Values are the means of triplicate determinations, and S.D. values were routinely <10% of the mean. SphK Inhibits Cell Motility toward PDGF and Serum without Affecting Cell Adhesion or PDGFR Signaling through the MAPK Family—We have recently shown that PDGF-induced chemotaxis requires SphK stimulation, S1P formation, and consequent transactivation of S1P1 (28Rosenfeldt H.M. Hobson J.P. Maceyka M. Olivera A. Nava V.E. Milstien S. Spiegel S. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2649-2659Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 29Hobson J.P. Rosenfeldt H.M. Barak L.S. Olivera A. Poulton S. Caron M.G. Milstien S. Spiegel S. Science. 2001; 291: 1800-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). In contrast, SphK1 overexpression and concomitant increased S1P levels inhibit the motility of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells, which do not express S1P1 (16Wang F. Van Brocklyn J.R. Edsall L. Nava V.E. Spiegel S. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6185-6191PubMed Google Scholar). The inside-out signaling by S1P, whereby its intracellular generation can lead to activation of S1PRs (29Hobson J.P. Rosenfeldt H.M. Barak L.S. Olivera A. Poulton S. Caron M.G. Milstien S. Spiegel S. Science. 2001; 291: 1800-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 35Johnson K.R. Becker K.P. Facchinetti M.M. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35257-35262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), prompted us to reinvestigate the roles of S1PRs in PDGF-induced chemotaxis. Similar to human breast cancer cells (16Wang F. Van Brocklyn J.R. Edsall L. Nava V.E. Spiegel S. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6185-6191PubMed Google Scholar), overexpression of SphK1 in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, which do express S1P1, markedly reduced chemotactic responses toward PDGF and serum (Fig. 1A). It is possible that this could result from altered adhesion to the collagen I matrix, which coated the filters utilized in the Boyden chamber assay. However, overexpression of SphK1 had no significant effects on the adhesiveness of cells to collagen (Fig. 1, B and C) or even to fibronectin, Matrigel, or polylysine (Fig. 1C). Cellular responses induced by PDGF, including chemotaxis, are initiated by activation and tyrosine phosphorylation of PDGFR, and this also was not affected by SphK1 overexpression (Fig. 1D). Moreover, activation of MAPK family members, in particular ERK1/2 and p38, which have been implicated in PDGF-mediated chemotaxis (36Ronnstrand L. Heldin C.H. Int. J. Cancer. 2001; 91: 757-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), was not reduced by overexpression of SphK1, whereas SAPK1/JNK was not stimulated by PDGF (Fig. 1D). These results suggest that the decreased motility is not due to a general impairment of PDGFR signaling. Expression of SphK1 Enhances Formation of Stress Fibers and Focal Adhesions—We next examined by histochemistry whether SphK1 influences the architecture of the actin cytoskeleton by phalloidin staining of actin filaments and using antibodies to focal adhesion components. In agreement with other studies (14Hall A. Science. 1998; 280: 2074-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 37Wang F. Nobes C.D. Hall A. Spiegel S. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 38Machesky L.M. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 913-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), in the absence of PDGF, vector-transfected cells had few thin actin filaments in the cell body, and only sparse small focal points at the cell periphery were detected with antibody against paxillin (Fig. 2C) or vinculin (data not shown). In contrast, even in the absence of PDGF, 3T3 cells expressing SphK1 had numerous stress fibers and focal adhesions (Fig. 2, E and G) that resembled those formed after PDGF stimulation (Fig. 2, B and D). Addition of PDGF to SphK1 transfectants did not further enhance stress fiber or focal adhesion formation (Fig. 2, F and H). These cytoskeletal rearrangements were mediated by increased formation of S1P, as the stress fibers in SphK1-expressing cells were completely eliminated by the SphK inhibitor N,N-dimethylsphingosine. It is well established that Rho triggers formation of contractile stress fibers and focal adhesion complexes (39Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3832) Google Scholar). Expression of SphK1 increased the cellular amount of the GTP-bound active form of Rho (Fig. 3A). In agreement with the established link between PDGF-mediated receptor stimulation and the Rho family of GTPases (40Sander E.E. ten Klooster J.P. van Delft S. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1009-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar, 41Ryu Y. Takuwa N. Sugimoto N. Sakurada S. Usui S. Okamoto H. Matsui O. Takuwa Y. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), PDGF induced transient activation of Rac (data not shown) and rapid inactivation of Rho (Fig. 3A), which was blunted by SphK1. Hyperphosphorylation of Src and FAK and Translocation of Paxillin and Vinculin to Focal Adhesions in SphK1 Transfectants—FAK and the Src family protein-tyrosine kinases (Src, Yes, and Fyn; hereafter referred to as Src) have been implicated in the organization and turnover of focal adhesions (42Salazar E.P. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28371-28378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 43Sieg D.J. Hauck C.R. Ilic D. Klingbeil C.K. Schaefer E. Damsky C.H. Schlaepfer D.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar). In agreement, PDGF rapidly increased phosphorylation of cytoskeleton-associated FAK at Tyr577, which is located in the kinase catalytic domain and is required for maximal activity, whereas in SphK1 transfectants, PDGF had no effect, and Tyr577 appeared to be constitutively hyperphosphorylated (Fig. 3B). PDGF also induced activation of cytoskeleton-associated Src, as determined with an antibody specific for Src phosphorylated at Tyr418, an autophosphorylation site located in its catalytic domain required for full activity. By contrast, basal Src activation was higher, and PDGF did not further in"

Two ATP-dependent AAA proteases with catalytic sites at opposite membrane surfaces are key components of this proteolytic system. Here we describe the identification of a novel conserved metallopeptidase that exerts activities overlapping with the m-AAA protease and was therefore termed Oma1. Both peptidases are integral parts of the inner membrane and mediate the proteolytic breakdown of a misfolded derivative of the polytopic inner membrane protein Oxa1. The m-AAA protease cleaves off the matrix-exposed C-terminal domain of Oxa1 and processively degrades its transmembrane domain. In the absence of the m-AAA protease, proteolysis of Oxa1 is mediated in an ATP-independent manner by Oma1 and a yet unknown peptidase resulting in the accumulation of N- and C-terminal proteolytic fragments. Oma1 exposes its proteolytic center to the matrix side; however, mapping of Oma1 cleavage sites reveals clipping of Oxa1 in loop regions at both membrane surfaces. These results identify Oma1 as a novel component of the quality control system in the inner membrane of mitochondria.

The majority of mitochondrial proteins is nuclear encoded and synthesized at cytosolic ribosomes. Import into mitochondria is mediated by various protein translocases in the outer and inner membrane that allow the passage of preproteins only in a largely unfolded conformation (1Truscott K. Brandner K. Pfanner N. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: R326-R337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 2Neupert W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 863-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar). Folding and assembly of mitochondrial proteins must therefore occur inside mitochondria. Little is known about the efficiency of this process, but it is clear that mitochondria, as other organelles, harbor a quality control system that ensures the recognition and removal of non-native polypeptides, preventing their potentially harmful accumulation within the organelle (3Käser M. Langer T. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 181-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Notably, a functional impairment of components of this system leads to neurodegeneration in various forms of hereditary spastic paraplegia, illustrating the importance of protein quality control for mitochondrial function (4Hansen J.J.

In line with the endosymbiotic origin of mitochondria, many of these components exhibit significant homology to bacterial proteins. ATP-dependent proteases homologous to Lon proteases (6Wang N.

Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 207-256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). These membrane-embedded peptidases were termed m- and i-AAA proteases to indicate their different topology in the inner membrane; the m-AAA protease is active on the matrix and the i-AAA protease on the intermembrane side of the membrane. Both proteases consist of homologous subunits conserved in all eukaryotic cells. The m-AAA protease is a hetero-oligomeric complex of Yta10 and Yta12 subunits in yeast (12Arlt H. Tauer R. Feldmann H. Neupert W. Langer T. Cell. 1996; 85: 875-885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) and of AFG3L2 and paraplegin subunits in human (13Atorino L. Silvestri L. Koppen M.

Protein degradation by ATP-dependent proteases results in the formation of peptides composed of ∼5–20 amino acid residues (17Kuzela S. Goldberg A.L.

Other known peptidases act as processing enzymes cleaving off mitochondrial targeting sequences from newly imported preproteins (25Gakh O. Cavadini P. Isaya G. Biochim. Biophys.

These include the mitochondrial processing peptidase and the intermediate peptidase in the matrix and, in the inner membrane, the inner membrane peptidase and the rhomboid peptidase Pcp1 (also termed Rbd1 or Mdm37), which has been linked to the processing of cytochrome c peroxidase (26Esser K.

Here we have analyzed the degradation of a misfolded variant of the polytopic membrane protein Oxa1, and we describe the identification of Oma1, a novel metallopeptidase in the inner membrane of mitochondria. Similar to the m-AAA protease, Oma1 is capable of degrading non-native membrane proteins and therefore represents a novel component of the quality control system that is conserved in higher eukaryotes, eubacteria and archaebacteria. Yeast Strains and Cloning Procedures—Yeast strains used in this study are derivatives of W303. The Δyta10 (YGS101 (29Arlt H. Steglich G. Perryman R. Guiard B. Neupert W. Langer T.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1281-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) mutant strains were described previously. Cells were grown on YP medium containing 2% galactose and 0.5% lactate at 30 °C or, in case of temperature-sensitive oxa1 mutant strains, at 24 °C. YTA10, YME1, and OMA1 were disrupted by PCR-targeted homologous recombination using the heterologous marker cassettes HIS3MX6 or KanMX4, respectively (31Wach A. Brachat A. Poehlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2232) Google Scholar). The complete open reading frame of OMA1 and an internal fragment of YTA10 (bp 150–2170) were replaced by the disruption cassettes. Homologous recombination was verified by PCR. Expression of a C-terminally Myc-tagged variant of Oma1 was achieved by modification of the genomic OMA1 gene by PCR-targeted homologous recombination (32Longtine M.S. McKenzie III, A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4135) Google Scholar).

Homologous recombination was verified by PCR. For in vitro synthesis of Oma1, the OMA1 gene was amplified by PCR using the primer pair 5′-GGG CTG CAG ATG TTC CGC TAT GAC AAT GGT-3′ (5′-primer) and 5′-GGG GGA TCC TTA CAT TGA GAA AAA ACT TTT-3′ (3′-primer). The PCR product was cloned into the pCRII-TOPO-vector (Promega) to allow in vitro transcription by the SP6 RNA polymerase. Site-directed Mutagenesis of OMA1—Point mutations were introduced into OMA1 using a PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis kit (QuikChange; Stratagene) according to the instructions from the provider. OMA1 cloned into the yeast expression vector YCplac111 under the control of the ADH1 promoter was used as a template in the PCR. Glutamic acid residue 173 was replaced by glutamine by using the primer pair 5′-GATGGGATTGCCACTGTTTTAGCACACCAATTTGCTCATCAGCTAGCAAGAC-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-GTCTTGCTAGCTGATGAGCAAATTGGTGTGCTAAAACAGTGGCAATCCCATC-3′ (reverse primer); the histidine residue 176 was replaced by tyrosine by using the primer pair 5′-GCCACTGTTTTAGCACACGAATTTGCTTATCAGCTAGCAAGACACACAGTGGC-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-CGGCTGTGTGTGTCTTGCTAGCTGATAACAAATTCGTGTGCTAAAACAGTGGC-3′ (reverse primer); and histidine residue 181 was replaced by tyrosine by using the primer pair 5′-GCTCATCAGCTAGCAAGATACACAGCCGAAAATTTGTCGAAGGCTCC-3′(forward primer) and 5′-GGAGCGTTCGACAAATTTTCGGCTGTGTATCTTGCTAGCTGATGAGC-3′ (reverse primer). Nucleotide exchanges were verified by DNA sequencing. Protein Import into Isolated Mitochondria—Mitochondria were isolated as described previously (33Daum G. Gasser S.M. Schatz G. J. Biol.

After in vitro transcription of the genes using SP6 polymerase, precursor proteins were synthesized in reticulocyte lysate (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine and imported into mitochondria for 15 min at 25 °C as described (35Wagner I. Arlt H. van Dyck L. Langer T. Neupert W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5135-5145Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Mitochondria harboring the temperature-sensitive Oxa1 mutant protein were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C prior to import to induce the phenotype. Non-imported preproteins were digested by the addition of 100 μg/ml trypsin (for 20 min at 4 °C). To inhibit the protease, a 20-fold molar excess of soybean trypsin inhibitor was added. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Proteolysis of Oxa1ts—After import and protease treatment, mitochondria were re-isolated and suspended in import buffer (50 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.2, 0.5 m sorbitol, 80 mm KCl, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, 1 mm MgCl2, 3% (w/v) fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin) containing an ATP-regenerating system (2 mm ATP, 20 mm phosphocreatine, 100 μg/ml creatine kinase). The stability of imported polypeptides was examined at 37 °C. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. To assess the proteolytic breakdown of endogenous Oxa1ts, mitochondria (30 μg) were incubated in import buffer containing ATP and the ATP-regenerating system at 25 or 37 °C. Proteolysis was halted at the indicated times by cooling the samples on ice. Mitochondria were reisolated, and mitochondrial proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Subfractionation of Mitochondria—Mitoplasts were generated by hypotonic swelling of mitochondria. Mitochondria (30 μg) were suspended at a concentration of 0.1 mg/ml in 20 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.2, supplemented with import buffer (10%). Proteinase K (50 μg/ml) was added where indicated. Samples were then incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. The protease treatment was halted by adding PMSF 1The abbreviation used is: ! PMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. (2 mm). Control mitochondria (non-swelling conditions) were diluted to the same extent in SHKCl buffer (0.6 m sorbitol, 80 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.2). Mitochondria and mitoplasts were re-isolated by centrifugation, washed once with SHKCl buffer supplemented with PMSF (1 mm), and lysed in SDS sample buffer. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. The efficiency of swelling was assessed by immunodecoration with antisera against cytochrome b2 (soluble intermembrane space protein), the ADP/ATP carrier (inner membrane protein), and Mge1 (soluble matrix protein). phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. For alkaline extraction of mitochondrial membranes, mitochondria were suspended at a concentration of 0.1 mg/ml in 0.1 m Na2CO3, pH 10.5, and 1 mm PMSF. After incubation for 30 min at 4 °C, soluble and insoluble proteins were separated by centrifugation for 60 min at 220,000 × g. Soluble proteins were trichloroacetic acid-precipitated, and both fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. The fractionation was tested by immunodetection of marker proteins as described above. Gel Filtration Analysis—Mitochondria expressing a Myc-tagged variant of Oma1 (600 μg) were solubilized during an incubation for 15 min at 4 °C in 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 150 mm potassium acetate, 4 mm magnesium acetate, 0.5 mm PMSF, 30 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, at a concentration of 5 mg/ml. After a clarifying spin for 15 min at 30,000 × g, mitochondrial extracts were loaded onto a Superose 6 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences). Eluate fractions were collected, trichloroacetic acid-precipitated, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting by using an antiserum against the c-Myc epitope. Sequence Alignments—Sequences homologous to yeast Oma1 (open reading frame YKR087c) were identified by FastA (36Pearson W.R. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 183: 63-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (1643) Google Scholar) in the TrEMBL + Swiss Protein Database. These were compiled by PileUp (GCG Wisconsin Package, version 10.2 (Accelrys Inc.)) in a multi-sequence alignment. Those sequences that are homologous to the region surrounding the HEXXH region of Oma1 were included in a second multisequence alignment by ClustalW (37Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55409) Google Scholar). This resulted in the identification of the conserved proteolytic domain. Prediction of transmembrane regions was done by TopPred (38van Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 487-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar) and “DAS” (39Cserzo M. Wallin E. Simon I. van Heijne G. Elofsson A. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 673-676Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Antibody Production—Degradation of endogenous Oxa1ts in mitochondria was monitored using antisera directed against a C-terminal peptide of Oxa1 (40Herrmann J.M. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2217-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and an N-terminal peptide of Oxa1. For generation of the latter, the peptide CSIDELTSSAPSLSASTSD-amide (corresponding to amino acid residues 61–78 of the preprotein) was coupled with maleimide-activated carrier protein (Imject, Pierce) to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and used for generation of antibodies in rabbits. Proteolysis of a Mutant Variant of Oxa1 Causing a Temperature-sensitive Growth Phenotype—Oxa1 is a polytopic mitochondrial membrane protein with an N-terminal domain facing the intermembrane space and a C-terminal domain exposed to the matrix space (Fig. 1A) (40Herrmann J.M. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2217-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 41Luirink J. Samuelsson T. de Gier J.W. FEBS Lett. 2001; 501: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 42Yen M.R. Harley K.T. Tseng Y.H. Saier M.H. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2001; 204: 223-231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A temperature-sensitive mutant allele of OXA1 has been identified (43Bauer M. Behrens M. Esser K. Miachelis G. Pratje E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 245: 272-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), which causes an exchange of leucine 240, located in a loop region in the intermembrane space, to serine (44Meyer W. Bauer M. Pratje E. Curr. Genet. 1997; 31: 401-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis of mitochondria isolated from an oxa1ts mutant strain grown at permissive temperature revealed reduced steady state levels of Oxa1 when compared with wild type mitochondria (Fig. 1B). We therefore examined the stability of mutant Oxa1 and incubated isolated mitochondria at 37 °C (Fig. 1B). Endogenous Oxa1ts was degraded within mitochondria with a half-life of about 10 min, whereas Oxa1 was stable under these conditions (Fig. 1B). In subsequent experiments, both proteins were synthesized in rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence of [35S]methionine and imported post-translationally into isolated wild type mitochondria at permissive temperature. We observed proteolysis of Oxa1ts but not of Oxa1 when mitochondria were further incubated at 37 °C after completion of import (Fig. 1C). Oxa1ts retains functional activity under permissive conditions (43Bauer M. Behrens M. Esser K. Miachelis G. Pratje E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 245: 272-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). It is therefore conceivable that replacement of leucine 240 by serine destabilizes Oxa1 causing its rapid degradation under non-permissive conditions. Alternatively, the mutant protein might be mislocalized within mitochondria due to an impaired insertion of Oxa1ts into the inner membrane. To test the validity of either possibility, mitochondria isolated from wild type and the oxa1ts strain were subfractionated, and the intramitochondrial localization of mutant and wild type Oxa1 was determined. Both proteins were accessible to externally added proteinase K after osmotic disruption of the outer membrane (Fig. 1D). In agreement with previous observations (40Herrmann J.M. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2217-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), C-terminal fragments of Oxa1 with a molecular mass of about 27 kDa were generated under these conditions by proteolytic removal of the N-terminal domain of Oxa1 in the intermembrane space. In contrast, a C-terminal fragment with a molecular mass of about 19 kDa accumulated in mitoplasts of oxa1ts mitochondria under these conditions (Fig. 1D and Fig. 6). The L240S mutation apparently resulted in a destabilization of the loop region between transmembrane regions 2 and 3, making it accessible for proteolytic degradation by proteinase K. Oxa1 and Oxa1ts as well as the C-terminal fragments generated by proteinase K treatment of mitoplasts were exclusively recovered from the membrane fraction upon alkaline extraction (Fig. 1D). Although its exact membrane topology remains to be determined, these results demonstrate the insertion of Oxa1ts into the inner membrane. We therefore conclude that local misfolding of the mutant protein rather than its impaired insertion into the inner membrane causes the lability of Oxa1ts. Degradation of Oxa1ts by the m-AAA Protease but Not the i-AAA Protease—In order to identify proteases involved in the degradation of Oxa1ts, the stability of the mutant protein was analyzed after import into Δyta10 and Δyme1 mitochondria lacking the m-AAA protease or the i-AAA protease, respectively. Deletion of YME1 did not affect the proteolytic breakdown of Oxa1ts (Fig. 2A), even though mutating leucine 240 to serine was found to cause misfolding of an intermembrane space loop of Oxa1 (Fig. 1D). Degradation of full-length Oxa1ts was impaired, however, in mitochondria lacking the m-AAA protease subunit Yta10 (Fig. 2A). Proteolytic fragments that were not detectable in wild type mitochondria accumulated in these mitochondria (Fig. 2A). Thus, the m-AAA protease is involved in but is not essential for the degradation of newly imported Oxa1ts. We generated oxa1ts mutant strains lacking either the m- or the i-AAA protease to monitor the role of these proteases during degradation of Oxa1tsin vivo. Mitochondria were isolated from these strains, incubated at non-permissive temperatures where indicated, and subsequently analyzed by immunoblotting with polyclonal antisera directed against N- or C-terminal peptides of Oxa1 (Fig. 2B). Whereas no N-terminal fragments were detected, a C-terminal fragment of about 14 kDa (C14) corresponding to the matrix-exposed domain of Oxa1 accumulated in oxa1ts mitochondria (Fig. 2B). This fragment was generated by the m-AAA protease because it was not detected in oxa1tsΔyta10 mitochondria (Fig. 2B). In agreement with the import studies (Fig. 2A), several other proteolytic fragments of Oxa1ts accumulated in these mitochondria. These include the N-terminal fragments N22, N25, and N27 (the numbers indicate the estimated molecular weights) and the C-terminal fragments C15, C16, C17, and C20 (Fig. 2B and Fig. 6). Deletion of the i-AAA protease did not impair the degradation of Oxa1tsin vivo. We only observed the accumulation of the proteolytic fragment C14 as in oxa1ts mitochondria (Fig. 2B). These findings assign a crucial role to the m-AAA protease for the degradation of Oxa1tsin vitro as well as in vivo and provide evidence for the involvement of yet another protease in the proteolytic breakdown of this polytopic membrane protein. The i-AAA protease is known to exert an overlapping substrate specificity to the m-AAA protease (45Leonhard K. Guiard B. Pellechia G. Tzagoloff A. Neupert W. Langer T. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 629-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Therefore, it cannot be excluded that the i-AAA protease, although not essential for proteolysis, generates proteolytic fragments of Oxa1ts in the absence of the m-AAA protease. The evaluation of this hypothesis is made difficult by the synthetic lethality of mutations in both AAA proteases (45Leonhard K. Guiard B. Pellechia G. Tzagoloff A. Neupert W. Langer T. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 629-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 46Lemaire C. Hamel P. Velours J. Dujardin G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23471-23475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We used biochemical means to characterize the generation of the proteolytic fragments of newly imported Oxa1ts in oxa1tsΔyta10 mitochondria (Fig. 3). Although affecting the accumulation of C20, depletion of mitochondria of ATP did not significantly affect the formation of N22 (Fig. 3A). For further characterization, the requirement for divalent metal ions for the proteolytic breakdown of newly imported Oxa1ts in oxa1tsΔyta10 mitochondria was examined (Fig. 3B). Mitochondria were depleted of divalent metal ions by adding the chelating agents EDTA and o-phenanthroline, the latter being membrane-permeable. Formation of fragments N22 and C20 was strongly reduced under these conditions (Fig. 3B). Notably, N22 and C20 accumulated if only EDTA was added to the reaction suggesting that divalent metal ions are required in the mitochondrial matrix space (Fig. 3B). An involvement of the ATP-dependent i-AAA protease which exposes its metal-binding site to the intermembrane space can therefore be excluded. Thus, these experiments suggest that a novel metallopeptidase can degrade Oxa1ts which exposes its catalytic site(s) to the matrix space. Genome-wide Screening for Mitochondrial Metallopeptidases in Silico—In order to identify this proteolytic activity, we screened the genome sequence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae for open reading frames encoding putative metallopeptidases with consensus metal-binding motifs HEXXH or HXXEH. The pattern search led to the identification of 180 and 93 putative proteins containing the HEXXH and the HXXEH motif, respectively. Proteins with known functions in cellular compartments other than mitochondria were not further considered. In the next step, the probability of localization in mitochondria was evaluated using the PSORTII algorithm (47Nakai K. Kanehisa M. Genomics. 1992; 14: 897-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar). As mitochondrial inner membrane proteins often lack a cleavable mitochondrial presequence, making the prediction of the cellular localization more difficult, we also examined the remaining proteins for the existence of hydrophobic segments that might serve as transmembrane regions. This procedure led to the identification of several genes coding for putative mitochondrial metallopeptidases, including both soluble as well as membrane-bound proteins. OMA1 Encodes a Novel Metallopeptidase in the Inner Membrane of Mitochondria—The open reading frame YKR087c attracted our attention as it codes for a putative membrane-bound mitochondrial protein of 35.8 kDa that harbors a conserved domain of the metallopeptidase family M48 (48Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. Academic Press, London1998: 989-991Google Scholar). Homologous proteins are present in higher eukaryotes, including plants, and in eubacteria as well as archaebacteria (Fig. 4, A and B) but have not been analyzed. Notably, homologues in higher eukaryotic cells have an N-terminal extension that is missing in eubacterial and archaebacterial proteins (Fig. 4, A and B). For reasons outlined below, the yeast protein encoded by YKR087c was termed Oma1 (for overlapping activity with m-AAA protease). To determine the subcellular localization of Oma1, we generated a variant carrying a Myc tag at the C terminus. Yeast cells expressing Oma1m"

Moreover, ER exit of apoB was inhibited by dominant-negative Sar1.

Using membranes from cells incubated in the presence or absence of OA, we determined that apoB100-lipoproteins in ER vesicles had not become lipidated to VLDLs. VLDL particles resided in the Golgi, but not the ER, after fractionation of OA-treated cells. We conclude that apoB100-lipoproteins exit the ER in COPII vesicles, but under conditions favorable for VLDL formation final lipid loading occurs post-ER.

Intracompartmental protein transport in the secretory pathway can be mediated by vesicles that form upon coat protein recruitment. After budding from the donor membrane, vesicles dock, shed their coats, and fuse with target membranes to deliver cargo (1Barlowe C.

The COPII complex functions in ER-derived vesicle formation for anterograde transport and was identified through yeast genetic and biochemical approaches (2Barlowe C. Orci L. Yeung T. Hosobuchi M.

These subunits associate with cargo molecules and form ER-derived vesicles, which are typically 60–80 nm in diameter (5Kuge O. Dascher C. Orci L. Rowe T. Amherdt M. Plutner H. Ravazzola M.

A major question related to COPII-mediated cargo capture is how cargo larger than this size can be transported beyond the ER. endoplasmic reticulum apolipoprotein B high density lipoprotein low density lipoprotein oleic acid very low density lipoprotein trans-Golgi network hemagglutinin wild-type medium-speed supernatant bovine serum albumin protein disulfide isomerase McArdle. One such cargo is the class of lipoproteins containing apolipoprotein B (apoB). ApoB has two forms, apoB48 (expressed in mammalian intestine and in rodent liver) and apoB100 (expressed in mammalian liver) (8Fisher E.A. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17377-17380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Lipoproteins transport water-insoluble lipids, such as triglycerides, cholesterol, and cholesteryl esters in the plasma. The apoB-containing particles are chylomicrons (of intestinal origin), very low density lipoprotein (VLDL; of hepatic origin), and low density lipoprotein (LDL; a product of VLDL metabolism), and they all promote atherosclerosis. Depending on the amount of neutral lipid (cholesteryl ester and triglyceride) associated with chylomicrons and VLDL, the secretory pathways of the intestine and liver, respectively, have to accommodate lipoproteins that often possess diameters well in excess of >100 nm. In fact, it has been suggested that novel transport processes may be required for apoB-lipoprotein intracellular trafficking (9Schekman R. Mellman I. Cell. 1997; 90: 197-200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Another formidable barrier to transport these lipoproteins regards the complexity of the particle assembly process. In addition to apoB, cholesteryl ester, and triglyceride, phospholipids, cholesterol, and other apolipoproteins are also components of these particles. In the liver, the initial assembly involves the co-translocational association of apoB polypeptides with lipids, which is mediated by the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein and results in the formation of a relatively small (∼20 nm) dense lipoprotein particle. The other components, including additional lipids, are added subsequently. The outcome is the production of mature VLDL particles of 80–200 nm in diameter (8Fisher E.A. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17377-17380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Although experimental data suggest that final maturation of VLDL takes place in the ER (10Alexander C.A. Hamilton R.L. Havel R.J. J.

In the present report, we investigated both the nature of the ER exit process of hepatic apoB100-lipoprotein particles and the site of VLDL formation. These studies were performed in rat hepatoma cells (McArdle RH-7777), which have many features of primary hepatocytes (18Lin Y. Smit M.J. Havinga R. Verkade H.J. Vonk R.J. Kuipers F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1256: 88-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and in cell-free systems using enriched, intracellular components. In addition, we regulated the size of the mature, secreted, lipoprotein particles by maintaining cells in either a basal or a lipid-rich medium to stimulate triglyceride synthesis and thereby increase lipid loading. We found that ER exit of apoB100-lipoproteins employs a COPII-dependent mechanism, although the transport vesicles carrying apoB100 had a number of features distinct from those containing more typical cargo. In addition, we found that independent of the final size of the lipoprotein, relatively small, dense apoB100-lipoproteins exit the ER, and under conditions that support VLDL formation, additional lipid loading occurs post-ER.

DNA fragment encoding Sar1 WT-HA was subcloned from the pET3a vector using KpnI and BglII restriction sites into a pTARGET vector (Promega, Madison, WI) using KpnI and BamHI cloning sites. Cell Culture—Rat hepatoma McA-RH7777 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 10% horse serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The medium was changed every 3 days. Preparation of Cytosol and Microsomal Membranes—Rat liver cytosol was prepared as described (19Bonifacino J.S. Dasso M. Harford J.B. Lippincott-Schwartz J.

McA-RH7777 cells were grown to confluency on 100-mm tissue culture dishes and labeled with [35S] protein labeling mix (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 3 h (100 μCi/ml/dish). Microsomal membranes were prepared as described (19Bonifacino J.S. Dasso M. Harford J.B. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yamada K.M. Morgan K.S. Current Protocols in Cell Biology.

In Vitro Formation and Isolation of ER-derived Vesicles—In vitro vesicle-formation assay was performed mainly as described (20Rowe T. Aridor M. McCaffery J.M. Plutner H. Nuoffer C. Balch W.E. J.

The budding reaction was carried out in total volume of 80 μl and contained microsomal membranes (50 mg total protein) from McA-RH7777 cells, 600 mg of rat liver cytosol, and an ATP regenerating mix (1.5 mm ATP, 0.5 mm GTP, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 5 units/ml of creatine kinase) in BBV buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 250 mm sorbitol, 70 mm potassium acetate, 1.5 mm magnesium acetate, 5 mm EGTA). For control reactions either the ATP regenerating mix and rat liver cytosol were omitted, or the ATP regenerating mix was substituted with 10 units/ml of the ATP hydrolyzing enzyme, apyrase. The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. In pilot studies, recovery of apoB100 or albumin failed to significantly increase after this time (data not shown). The reaction was then placed on ice for 2 min. Membranes were collected by centrifugation at 135,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C in Beckman TLA100 rotor (60,000 rpm). Pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of ice-cold resuspension buffer (20 mm HEPES, 250 mm sucrose, pH 7.4) by repeated pipetting for 10 min on ice, and potassium acetate and magnesium acetate were added to obtain final concentrations of 150 and 2.5 mm, respectively. After the mixture was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, 80% of the total of the medium-speed supernatant (MSS) was retained, and the rest of the supernatant was aspirated from the medium-speed pellet. The medium-speed pellet and MSS were resuspended in NET buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS), and apoB was immunoprecipitated with rabbit-anti-rat apoB antibody. For Western blot assays, MSS was centrifuged at 135,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C in a Beckman TLA100 rotor (60,000 rpm) to recover the high-speed pellet containing transport vesicles. For protease protection assays, MSS was treated with trypsin at a final concentration 0.1 mg/ml as described (22Gusarova V. Caplan A.J. Brodsky J.L. Fisher E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24891-24900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), and the indicated proteins were immunoprecipitated with rabbit-anti-rat apoB antibody or α2-macroglobulin antiserum. Immunoisolation of Vesicles Containing apoB—In vitro budding reactions were performed, and vesicles and membranes were separated as above. MSS was treated under non-denaturing conditions with rabbit anti-rat apoB antibody. The supernatant was reserved, the beads were washed, and the immunoprecipitated vesicles, containing apoB, were released with NET buffer containing 2% SDS and 1% Triton X-100. ApoB and albumin were immunoprecipitated from the reserved supernatant, and the material that was released from protein A vesicles with rabbit-anti-rat apoB and rabbit-anti-albumin antibodies. Density Gradient Fractionation and Immunoanalysis of Vesicles— McA-RH7777 cells were incubated with [35S] protein labeling mix, and vesicles were generated from the membranes purified from these cells. The vesicles were separated on sucrose gradients as described previously (23Muniz M. Morsomme P. Riezman H. Cell. 2001; 104: 313-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). To determine the distribution of apoB among the fractions, an aliquot of each fraction was taken, and apoB was immunoprecipitated in NET buffer with anti-apoB antibody. The material released from protein A was separated by SDS-PAGE, and the recovered apoB was detected by autoradiography. To determine the distributions of COPII, albumin, and transferrin, the remainder of each fraction was centrifuged at 60,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C in a Beckman TLA100 rotor, then pellets were resuspended in sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 20% β-mercaptoethanol, 2.5% bromphenol blue), and Western blotting was performed using the appropriate antibodies. Subcellular Fractionation—McA-RH7777 cells were grown on four 100-mm tissue culture dishes and pre-incubated in a low serum medium in 5% CO2 at 37 °C for 16 h (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum, 0.5% horse serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin). Two dishes of cells were incubated with BSA (0.16 mm), or to promote lipid loading of apoB, another two were incubated with OA/BSA (0.6 mm of OA; OA:BSA molar ratio = 5:1) for 2 h in the same medium. Cells were labeled with [35S] protein labeling mix for 3 h (100 μCi/ml) in the presence of BSA or OA/BSA in cysteine/methionine-free medium. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in 2.5 ml of homogenization buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 250 mm sucrose, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1× EDTA-free protease inhibitors mixture, 20 units/ml RNase inhibitor). Cells were homogenized by 10 passages through a 25-gauge needle and then 10 passages through a 30-gauge needle. Homogenates were centrifuged at 1900 × g for 10 min at 4 °C in a Beckman JS-4.3 rotor. Supernatants (2.3 ml) were loaded onto a sucrose density gradient containing the following layers (from the bottom): 56% sucrose (0.46 ml), 50% (0.92 ml), 45% (1.38 ml), 40% (2.3 ml), 35% (2.3 ml), 30% (1.38 ml), 20% (0.46 ml). After ultracentrifugation in a Beckman SW41 rotor at 39,000 rpm for 18 h at 4 °C, 15 fractions were collected from each centrifuge tube (0.75 ml each) from the top to the bottom. The distribution patterns of the subcellular compartment markers were achieved by either enzymatic assay (for mannosidase II, Golgi marker) (24Storrie B. Madden E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 203-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar) or Western blot (for calnexin, ER marker; TGN38, trans-Golgi network marker). Isolation of Microsomal Lumenal Contents—Lumenal contents were released from microsomes in the supernatant by treatment with 0.1 m sodium carbonate (pH 11) and deoxycholic acid (0.025%) for 25 min at room temperature, after which BSA was added to a final concentration of 5 mg/ml. These conditions have been shown previously (25Boren J. Rustaeus S. Olofsson S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25879-25888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to quantitatively remove apoB from microsomal membranes but not to delipidate apoB-lipoproteins. The samples were centrifuged at 60,000 rpm in a Beckman TLA 100.4 rotor for 1 h at 4 °C to separate microsomal membranes (pellet) from lumenal contents (supernatant). Lumenal contents were adjusted to pH 7.4 by the addition of 10% acetic acid. Sucrose Gradient Separation of ApoB-containing Lipoproteins—Microsomal membranes were prepared from cells treated or mock-treated with OA as above, and in vitro budding reactions were performed with these microsomal membranes in a final volume of 500 μl. Vesicles (high-speed pellet) were treated with sodium carbonate/deoxycholic acid to extract lipoproteins. The supernatants containing the extracted lipoproteins were recovered by centrifugation at 60,000 rpm for 1 h at 4 °C in a Beckman TLA100.4 rotor. Lipoproteins were separated according to density by ultracentrifugation on a sucrose gradient (25Boren J. Rustaeus S. Olofsson S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25879-25888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) after adjusting 4.8 ml of the supernatant to a sucrose concentration of 12.5% (w/v). The adjusted supernatants were then placed on the top of a step gradient consisting of 1.9 ml of 49% sucrose and 1.9 ml of 20% sucrose. Phosphate-buffered saline (2.8 ml) was layered over the gradient. All solutions contained a protease inhibitor mixture. The gradients were centrifuged in a Beckman SW41Ti rotor at 35,000 rpm for 65 h at 10 °C. Twelve fractions (0.95 ml each), with densities ranging from 1.005 to 1.21 g/ml, were collected from the top of the tube, and apoB was immunoprecipitated from each fraction with anti-apoB antibody. The density of each fraction was determined as the ratio of the weight of a 1-ml aliquot to the weight of a 1-ml aliquot of water. Immunofluorescence—Indirect immunofluorescence was performed as described (26Mitchell D.M. Zhou M. Pariyarath R. Wang H. Aitchison J.D. Ginsberg H.N. Fisher E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14733-14738Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The primary antibodies were anti-rat apoB (1:2000), anti-TGN38 (1:1000), anti-mannosidase II (final dilution 1:1000), and anti-PDI (1:1000). The secondary antibodies were either fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-rabbit or Texas Red-labeled anti-mouse (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). The fluorescent images were collected on a Zeiss laser confocal microscope. Transfection Studies—LipofectAMINE PLUS reagent (Invitrogen) was used to transfect McA-RH7777 cells with either the pTARGET-Sar1 WT-HA plasmid (control) or the pTARGET-Sar1 T39N-HA plasmid according to the protocol of the manufacturer. Five h later, cells were permeabilized, fixed, and treated as described previously (26Mitchell D.M. Zhou M. Pariyarath R. Wang H. Aitchison J.D. Ginsberg H.N. Fisher E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14733-14738Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 27Fisher E.A. Zhou M. Mitchell D.M. Wu X. Omura S. Wang H. Goldberg A.L. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol.

Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Samples for immunoprecipitation were diluted in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS and incubated with appropriate antibodies at 4 °C for 2 h followed by incubation with protein A-Sepharose at 4 °C for 2 h. The beads were washed three times with the same buffer, and immunoprecipitated material was released by heating at 100 °C in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. For Western blots, proteins were first resolved by SDS-PAGE and then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Typically, the primary and secondary antibodies were used at 1:1000 and 1:10,000 dilutions, respectively, with final detection of signal by the Western blot Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cell-free Reconstitution of ApoB100 ER Export—An in vitro budding assay (20Rowe T. Aridor M. McCaffery J.M. Plutner H. Nuoffer C. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 895-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 28Rexach M.F. Schekman R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 219-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) was used to study ER export of apoB100. Microsomes isolated from McA-RH7777 cells were incubated in the presence or absence of rat hepatic cytosol and an ATP regenerating system. There are two forms of apoB synthesized in rat hepatoma McA-RH7777 cells, apo48 and apoB100. Here, we monitored the results for apoB100 not only because these cells primarily synthesize this form, but also because only apoB100 is made by human liver, where it serves as the major structural protein for VLDL (8Fisher E.A. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17377-17380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). ApoB100 appeared in a vesicle-containing (v) fraction in a cytosol and energy-dependent manner (Fig. 1). As expected, the typical hepatic secretory protein albumin was also present in the vesicle fraction, and its appearance was also dependent on cytosol and energy (Fig. 1). The budding efficiencies of the complete reactions for apoB100 and albumin were 16% ± 3 (n = 4) and 23% ± 5(n = 4), respectively, comparable with that of other proteins studied in similar in vitro budding assays (21Nohturfft A. Yabe D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Espenshade P.J. Cell. 2000; 102: 315-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 23Muniz M. Morsomme P. Riezman H. Cell. 2001; 104: 313-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Budding was inefficient (less than 3%) if the reaction was performed on ice. The Sec23 protein (Fig. 1, COPII panel) was found in both membrane and vesicle fractions, suggesting that the vesicles were coated with COPII. The Western blot analyses displayed in Fig. 1 showed that the resident ER proteins calnexin, Sec61β, and PDI remained in the membrane fraction, making it unlikely that the vesicle fraction was created by nonspecific fragmentation of or leakage from the donor membranes. The absence of TGN38, a TGN marker, in the membrane fraction could not be explained by lack of immunoreactivity of the antibody (see Fig. 8) and is consistent with no or extremely low contamination of the microsomes by Golgi membranes, as predicted from the microsomal isolation protocol we employed (19Bonifacino J.S. Dasso M. Harford J.B. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yamada K.M. Morgan K.S. Current Protocols in Cell Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1998: 11.3.10-11.3.13Google Scholar). Further supporting the low level of Golgi contamination was an immunoblot analysis/comparison between our microsomal membrane preparation and purified rat liver Golgi membranes (kindly provided by David Sabatini, New York University School of Medicine). The Western blot signal for the Golgi proteins syntaxin 6 or Vti1a in the membrane preparation was <1% of the signal in an equivalent amount of Golgi protein (29Wendler F. Tooze S. Traffic. 2001; 2: 606-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 30Xu Y. Wong S.H. Tang B.L. Subramaniam V.N. Zhang T. Hong W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21783-21789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Overall, the data in Fig. 1 establish that we were successful in reconstituting apoB100 vesicle-mediated export from very highly enriched, ER-derived microsomes. Domain Exposure of apoB100 in ER-derived Vesicles— Though it does not possess a classic transmembrane domain, we and others have shown that apoB100 has domains exposed to the cytosol when it is present in the ER and Golgi (31Du X. Stoops J.D. Mertz J.R. Stanley C.M. Dixon J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 585-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 32Liang J. Wu X. Fisher E.A. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32003-32010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 33Davis R.A. Thrift R.N. Wu C.C. Howell K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10005-10011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore wondered whether there is also domain exposure of apoB100 in the ER-derived vesicles. Thus, apoB from the vesicle fraction was immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal antibody under either denaturing or non-denaturing conditions. Fig. 2 (panel A) shows that the recovery of apoB100 was comparable using either condition, implying that the majority of vesicles carrying apoB100 have a domain or domains exposed to the cytosol. Additional evidence for apoB100 domain exposure was obtained by incubating vesicles with exogenous trypsin. Fig. 2 (panel B) shows that apoB100, but not α2-macroglobulin (a soluble protein known to be fully translocated (34Ingram M.F. Shelness G.S. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 2202-2214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), was sensitive to trypsin. This result also demonstrated vesicle integrity. Albumin topology was not similarly examined, because it was shown previously (34Ingram M.F. Shelness G.S. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 2202-2214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that albumin, presumably because of its highly globular structure, is trypsin-resistant in the absence or presence of Triton X-100. ApoB100 Exits the ER in Vesicles Different from Those Containing the Typical Hepatic Secretory Protein, Albumin—To determine whether apoB100 resides in the same ER-derived vesicles as other hepatic secretory proteins, we performed the following sequential immunoprecipitation analysis. An in vitro ER budding reaction was performed, and vesicles and membranes were separated by low speed centrifugation. ApoB in the supernatant fraction (vesicles) was first immunoprecipitated with a specific antibody under non-denaturing conditions to isolate apoB-containing vesicles and to maintain their integrity. Aliquots of the supernatant and of the resuspended immunoprecipitate were then subjected to additional immunoprecipitations under denaturing conditions with either anti-apoB or anti-albumin antibody. That the vesicles maintained their integrity was confirmed by incubating them with trypsin after the non-denaturing immunoprecipitation with anti-apoB antibody. This resulted in protease sensitivity data identical to that presented in Fig. 2B, left panel (data not shown). Fig. 3A shows that after the first non-denaturing immunoprecipitation, apoB100 was depleted from the supernatant, in contrast to albumin (compare the two lanes 1). In addition, the vesicles containing apoB100 (lane 2, left) lack albumin (lane 2, right). These data suggest that apoB100 is packaged into vesicles distinct from those harboring a more typical secreted protein. The Sucrose Gradient Density Distribution of Vesicles Containing apoB100 Is Distinct from Those of Other Hepatic Secretory Proteins—The finding that apoB100 and albumin might reside in distinct vesicle populations prompted us to explore whether vesicles containing apoB100 were distinguishable on sucrose gradients from vesicles containing other cargo. By comparison, it was shown previously (23Muniz M. Morsomme P. Riezman H. Cell. 2001; 104: 313-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) that glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins reside in distinct vesicle populations from other cargo proteins. To this end, the ER-derived vesicles from an in vitro budding reaction were separated on sucrose gradients, and the distributions of apoB100, albumin, transferrin, and COPII were determined by either immunoprecipitation (apoB100) or Western blot analysis (all others). As shown in Fig. 3B, apoB100 was found in the bottom (dense) fractions of the gradient"

Here we show that the cross-talk between GnRHR and EGFR in gonadotropic cells is accomplished via gelatinases A and B (matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) 2 and 9), identifying gelatinases as the first distinct members of the MMP family mediating EGFR transactivation by G protein-coupled receptors. Using a specific MMP2 and MMP9 inhibitor, Ro28-2653, GnRH-dependent EGFR transactivation was abrogated. Proving the specificity of the effect, transient transfection of αT3-1 cells with ribozymes directed against MMP2 or MMP9 specifically blocked EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation in response to GnRH stimulation. GnRH challenge of αT3-1 cells furthered the release of active MMP2 and MMP9 and increased their gelatinolytic activities within 5 min. Rapid release of activated MMP2 or MMP9 was inhibited by ribozyme-targeted down-regulation of MT1-MMP or MMP2, respectively. We found that GnRH-induced Src, Ras, and ERK activation were also gelatinase-dependent. Thus, gelatinase-induced EGFR transactivation was required to engage the extracellular-signal regulated kinase cascade. Activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase and p38 MAPK by GnRH was unaffected by EGFR or gelatinase inhibition that, however, suppressed GnRH induction of c-Jun and c-Fos. Our findings suggest a novel role for gelatinases in the endocrine regulation of pituitary gonadotropes.

Our findings suggest a novel role for gelatinases in the endocrine regulation of pituitary gonadotropes. While the effect of receptor/G protein systems in sensory transduction and maintenance of cell homeostasis have been appreciated for quite some time, it has only recently been fully realized that heptahelical receptors play an important role in cellular growth, differentiation, and even transformation (1Dhanasekaran N.

Fischer O.M. Streit S. Hart S. Ullrich A. Endocr. Relat. Cancer. 2001; 8: 11-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Transactivation of the EGFR has been shown to be a common phenomenon of GPCR-dependent signal transduction (4Gschwind A. Zwick E. Prenzel N. Leserer M. Ullrich A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1594-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Our mechanistic understanding of this kind of receptor cross-talk as well as its biological importance, however, are still rather vague.An attractive model providing a mechanistic explanation for EGFR activation via GPCRs is based on regulated proteolytic release of local EGF-like ligands from transmembrane precursors (5Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. ).Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1491) Google Scholar). Secreted agonists are then thought to activate vicinal EGFRs after binding to the extracellular receptor domain (4Gschwind A. Zwick E. Prenzel N. Leserer M. Ullrich A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1594-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). EGF-related growth factors like amphiregulin, transforming growth factor-α, betacellulin, HB-EGF, and epiregulin are synthesized as membrane spanning pro-growth factors and are released through proteolytic processing. Enzymes that have been implicated in ectodomain shedding of growth factors mainly belong to two families: matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and metalloprotease-disintegrin proteins (MDCs/ADAMs) (3Prenzel N. Fischer O.M. Streit S. Hart S. Ullrich A. Endocr. Relat. Cancer. 2001; 8: 11-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 6Carpenter G. Sciences's STKE. 2000; http://wwwl.stke.org/2000/15/PE1PubMed Google Scholar).MMPs are a group of zinc- and calcium-dependent enzymes that regulate cell-matrix composition by degrading components of the extracellular matrix. MMPs are synthesized as zymogens with a signal sequence and a propeptide segment being removed during activation. After activation, MMPs are secreted into the extracellular medium, except for the membrane type (MT)-MMPs, which are tethered to the cell surface by a hydrophobic transmembrane domain (7Werb Z. Cell. 1997; 91: 439-442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1129) Google Scholar). Because GPCR-induced EGFR transactivation is sensitive to pretreatment of cells with the broad-spectrum MMP inhibitor batimastat, a cardinal role of MMPs in the receptor cross-talk has been invoked (5Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. ).Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1491) Google Scholar). However, the identity of the participating MMPs, their activation mechanism, as well as their physiological relevance for GPCR-initiated signaling processes still remain elusive.ADAMs are transmembrane proteins characterized by a zinc-dependent metalloproteinase, an adhesion domain, a fusion domain, and an intracellular signaling domain (8Blobel C.P. Cell. 1997; 90: 589-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Recently, ADAM9 MDC9/meltrin-γ has been identified as the protease responsible for the shedding of HB-EGF precursor in response to PKC activation (9Izumi Y. Hirata M. Hasuwa H. Iwamoto R. Umata T. Miyado K. Tamai Y. Kurisaki T. Sehara-Fujisawa A. Ohno S. Mekada E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7260-7272Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). However, GPCR-stimulated HB-EGF cleavage cannot be suppressed by dominant-negative forms of ADAM9, indicating that yet another protease mediates EGFR activation in response to GPCR signaling.In the pituitary gland, the decapeptide GnRH interacts with a heptahelical receptor to regulate the synthesis and secretion of the gonadotropins leutinizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone and to secure the maintenance of the gonadotropic phenotype (10Kaiser U.B. Conn P.M. Chin W.W. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 46-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). In transfected COS-7 cells and αT3-1 cells derived from the gonadotrope lineage, the GnRHR initiates multiple signaling pathways by exclusively coupling to Gq/11 proteins (11Grosse R. Schmid A. Schoneberg T. Herrlich A. Muhn P. Schultz G. Gudermann T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9193-9200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In αT3-1 cells, all four subfamilies of MAPKs, i.e. ERKs, JNK/SAPK, p38 MAPK, and big MAPK (BMK1/ERK5) (12Pearson G. Robinson F. Beers Gibson T. Xu B.E. Karandikar M. Berman K. Cobb M.H. Endocr. Rev. 2001; 22: 153-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (3488) Google Scholar), are activated upon GnRH stimulation (13Naor Z. Benard O. Seger R. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 11: 91-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), and ERK activity is required for GnRH-induced expression of the common α-subunit gene (14Roberson M.S. Misra-Press A. Laurance M.E. Stork P.J. Maurer R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3531-3539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) through a pathway critically involving PKC (15Reiss N. Llevi L.N. Shacham S. Harris D. Seger R. Naor Z. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1673-1682Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 16Sundaresan S. Colin I.M. Pestell R.G. Jameson J.L. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 304-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that GnRHR/Gq/11-coupling leads to rapid PKC-dependent ERK activation requiring functional Ras. Additionally, the kinetics and maximal response of ERK activation critically depends on EGFR transactivation (17Grosse R. Roelle S. Herrlich A. Höhn J. Gudermann T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12251-12260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, the exact mechanism underlying GnRH-induced EGFR activation as well as its consequences for transcriptional responses in gonadotropes remain unknown.Here we dissect the signal transduction pathway underlying GnRH-induced EGFR activation in αT3-1 and LβT2 cells. By applying a pharmacological approach with a set of specific MMP inhibitors as well as ribozyme-mediated down-regulation of MMP gene expression, we show that MMP2 and MMP9 (gelatinases A and B, respectively) become activated within 5 min after GnRH challenge leading to EGFR transactivation. We provide initial evidence that MT1-MMP is involved in this process in αT3-1 cells. Furthermore, gelatinase-evoked EGFR activation is of cell physiological relevance because it is indispensable for the induction of immediate early response genes c-fos and c-jun by GnRH. Thus, apart from defining a role of gelatinases for the endocrine regulation of gonadotropic cells, we describe a novel signaling concept, namely the activation of gelatinases by Gq/11-coupled receptors.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsThe cell culture supply was purchased from PAA (Coelbe, Germany).

All other reagents were obtained from Sigma.MethodsTissue Culture—αT3-1 cells and LβT2 cells were kind gifts of P. L. Mellon (18Turgeon J.L. Kimura Y. Waring D.W. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 439-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Windle J.J. Weiner R.I. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). PC-3 cells were from the American Type Culture Collection. αT3-1 cells were grown in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 5% horse serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 5 μg/ml l-glutamine. LβT2 cells were maintained in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 5 μg/ml l-glutamine. PC-3 cells were grown in RPMI medium supplemented with 50 mm Hepes, 10% fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 5 μg/ml l-glutamine. Cells were seeded into 6-well plates and grown to 80% confluency. Prior to stimulation, cells were serum starved for 6 (αT3-1 cells), 18 (LβT2 cells), or 36 h (PC-3 cells). Experiments were performed in serum-free medium containing various substances as indicated in the figure legends. Basal values were determined in serum-depleted medium.Precipitation and Western Blotting Procedures—Stimulation of cells was carried out as indicated in the respective figure legends. Reactions were stopped by washing cells once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. For Western blotting, cells were lysed by adding 200 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Lysates were sonicated and boiled for 3 min at 95 °C. Precleared lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE. The EGFR was immunoprecipitated as described before (17Grosse R. Roelle S. Herrlich A. Höhn J. Gudermann T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12251-12260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Precipitates were resuspended in 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, boiled for 3 min, and resolved by SDS-PAGE. The protein samples were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes following immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. To control the amounts of detected proteins, blots were stripped in stripping buffer (100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7) for2hat65 °C and reprobed with the indicated antibodies. For detection of gelatinases by Western blotting, cell culture media were concentrated using a concentration device (Centrikon, Millipore, Illkrich, France). Samples containing 15 μg of protein were electrophoresed on 9% SDS-PAGE. After using the appropriate secondary horseradish-specific peroxidase-conjugated antibodies, visualization was carried out on x-ray film by enhanced chemiluminescence. GST fusion proteins containing the minimal Ras-binding domain of Raf-1 (amino acids 51-131) were prepared as described (20Herrmann C. Martin G.A. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2901-2905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), and GTP loading of Ras activity was determined as outlined in detail before (21de Rooij J. Bos J.L. Oncogene. 1997; 114: 623-625Crossref Scopus (420) Google Scholar).Gelatin Zymography—Zymography was performed according to a previously published method (22Heussen C. Dowdle E.B. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 102: 196-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (1844) Google Scholar). In brief, cell culture media were concentrated using a concentration device (Centrikon, Millipore, Illkrich, France). Samples containing 15 μg of protein were electrophoresed on 9% non-reducing SDS-PAGE gels containing 0.1% gelatin as a substrate. Gels were washed two times in 2.5% Triton X-100 for 15 min. Gels were preincubated in reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 1 μm ZnCl2, 0.02% Brij-35) for 30 min and subsequently incubated in reaction buffer for 18 h at 37 °C. Gelatinolytic activity was visualized as clear areas in a Coomassie Blue-stained gel.Ribozyme Transfection—Hammerhead ribozymes were synthesized as all-RNA molecules targeting MMP2 (Rz-MMP2, 5′-CCACAGUGCUGAUGAGUCCGUUUAGGGACGAAACAUAGCG-3′), MMP9 (Rz-MMP9, 5′-ACGUCUGGCUGAUGAGUCCGUUAGGACGAAACACCACA-3′), MMP12 (Rz-MMP12, 5′-UGAUGGUGCUGAUGAGUCCGUUAGGACGAAACUGCUAG-3′), MT1-MMP (Rz-MT1-MMP, 5′-CUCAUUUUGCUGAUGAGUCCGUUAGGACGAAACAGUCCA-3′), ADAM10 (Rz-ADAM10, 5′-CAAUGACACUGAUGAGUCCGUUAGGACGAAACCCAUGA-3′), or fibroblast growth factor-binding protein (Rz-FGF-BP, 5′-UUCCAAUACUGAUGAGUCCGUUAGGACGAAACUCUCU-3′). αT3-1 cells were seeded into 6-well plates and cultivated to ∼80% confluency. Ribozymes were complexed and transfected into αT3-1 cells as described before (23Aigner A. Fischer D. Merdan T. Brus C. Kissel T. Czubayko F. Gene Ther. 2002; 24: 1700-1707Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In brief, 0.5 μg of ribozomal RNA were added to 50 μl of 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, and mixed with 3 μl of jetPEI prior diluted in 50 μl of 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, per well. After vortexing, the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 15 min and subsequently added to the cells as indicated in the figure legends. Cells were incubated with the RNA/jetPEI mixture for 6 h and then cultured on serum-free medium for another 6 h before stimulation. Basal levels of cells transfected with ribozymes were monitored in each experiment. Because values did not change significantly from basal values of non-transfected cells, they were taken out of the figures to simplify matters.Reproducibility of Results—All assays were performed independently at least three times. One representative experiment is shown.RESULTSGelatinase Activity Is Involved in GnRH-mediated EGFR Transactivation in Gonadotropic Cells—To identify distinct proteolytic enzymes involved in GnRH-mediated EGFR transactivation, we first chose a pharmacological approach. Because members of the gelatinase subfamily of MMPs (MMP2 and MMP9) are expressed in pituitary tumors and normal pituitary glands (24Beaulieu E. Kachra Z. Mousseau N. Delbecchi L. Hardy J. Beliveau R. Neurosurgery. 1999; 45: 1432-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 25Paez-Pereda M. Ledda M.F. Goldberg V. Chervin A. Carrizo G. Molina H. Muller A. Renner U. Podhajcer O.

Metab. 2000; 85: 2931-2935Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), we initially focused on a potential involvement of MMP2 and MMP9 in GnRH-dependent signal transduction in gonadotropes.Prior to GnRH challenge, αT3-1 cells were incubated with Ro28-2653, a novel pyrimidine-2,4,6-trion-based MMP inhibitor characterized by a high selectivity for MMP2 and MMP9 (27Arlt M. Kopitz C. Pennington C. Watson K.L. Krell H.-W. Bode W. Gansbacher B. Khokha R. Edwards D.R. Kruger A. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 5543-5550PubMed Google Scholar, 28Grams F. Brandstetter H. D'Alo S. Geppert D. Krell H.-W. Leinert H. Livi V. Menta E. Oliva A. Zimmermann G. Gram F. Brandstetter H. D'Alo S. Geppert D. Krell H.-W. Leinert H. Livi V. Menta E. Oliva A. Zimmermann G. Biol.

Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2089-2096Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Subsequent to agonist stimulation, the EGFR was immunoprecipitated and Western blots of immunoprecipitates were probed with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. As shown in Fig. 1A, GnRH transactivated the EGFR in a Ro28-2653-sensitive manner implicating a role for gelatinases in the crosstalk between GnRHR and EGFR. The unspecific MMP inhibitor batimastat (BB-94) had only a minor inhibitory effect on GnRH-mediated EGFR activation in αT3-1 cells at the concentration tested (10 μm). We have previously shown that GnRH-induced ERK activation in αT3-1 cells is preceded by EGFR transactivation (17Grosse R. Roelle S. Herrlich A. Höhn J. Gudermann T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12251-12260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Because ERK activation in these cells is dependent on Src activity, we chose antibodies specific for EGFRY845 to detect activated EGFR. Tyrosine 845 within the catalytic domain of the EGFR has been shown to be phosphorylated by Src and is involved in regulating receptor function (30Biscardi J.S. Maa M.C. Tice D.A. Cox M.E. Leu T.H. Parsons S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8335-8843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). GnRH challenge led to phosphorylation of tyrosine 845 of the EGFR, which was inhibited by preincubation of the cells with Ro28-2653 (Fig. 1B). Batimastat treatment had only a less pronounced effect (Fig. 1B). Ro28-2653 or BB-94 treatment of unstimulated cells did not reduce the basal phosphorylation status of the EGFR. GnRH-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR was almost completely prevented by pretreatment of cells with 1,10-phenanthroline, a chelator of bivalent ions such as zinc (data not shown), thus lending additional support to the involvement of zinc-dependent endopeptidases. As a control, the effect of Ro28-2653 and batimastat on EGF-mediated EGFR activation in αT3-1 cells was examined. As expected, EGF increased EGFR phosphorylation in a Ro28-2653- and batimastat-independent way (data not shown). Batimastat has been reported to ablate bombesin-induced EGFR transactivation in PC-3 prostate cancer cells (5Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. ).Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1491) Google Scholar). To control for the activity of the batimastat solution used, PC-3 cells were pretreated with batimastat and subsequently stimulated with bombesin. Batimastat abrogated bombesin-induced EGFR phosphorylation (data not shown) demonstrating that the observed weak inhibitory property of batimastat (Fig. 1, A and B) was a characteristic feature of αT3-1 cells. These results indicate a predominant role of gelatinases for GPCR-induced EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation in gonadotropic cells.To unequivocally define the role of gelatinases for the activation of EGFR by GnRH, an independent specific ribozyme-based approach was applied. αT3-1 cells were transiently transfected with ribozymes directed against MMP2 (Rz-MMP2), MMP9 (Rz-MMP9), and, as controls, against MMP12 (Rz-MMP12) or an unrelated fibroblast growth factor-binding protein (Rz-FGF-BP). MMP12, human macrophage elastase belonging to the MMP subgroup of stromelysins, was targeted because Ro28-2653 inhibits MMP12 apart from MMP2 and MMP9 (28Grams F. Brandstetter H. D'Alo S. Geppert D. Krell H.-W. Leinert H. Livi V. Menta E. Oliva A. Zimmermann G. Gram F. Brandstetter H. D'Alo S. Geppert D. Krell H.-W. Leinert H. Livi V. Menta E. Oliva A. Zimmermann G. Biol. Chem. 2001; 382: 1277-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Beforehand, the kinetics of ribozyme-induced down-regulation of MMP2 and MMP9 expression in αT3-1 cells were studied. Cells were incubated with ribozymes Rz-MMP2 or Rz-MMP9 for 6, 12, 18, and 24 h. Incubation of αT3-1 cells with ribozymes for 6 h resulted in maximal suppression of GnRH-mediated EGFR phosphorylation, whereas longer incubation times had no further inhibitory effect (data not shown). Basal values did not change significantly in cells transfected with either ribozyme compared with non-transfected cells (Fig. 1C). The most prominent inhibitory effect was observed when αT3-1 cells were transfected with ribozyme Rz-MMP2 (Fig. 1C). GnRH-mediated EGFR activation was also substantially blocked in cells transfected with ribozymes directed against MMP9. However, GPCR-induced EGFR phosphorylation was nearly unaffected in cells transfected with ribozyme Rz-MMP12. As a negative control, αT3-1 cells were transiently transfected with a ribozyme directed against FGF-BP, because this binding protein is not involved in the receptor cross-talk under study. As expected, cells transiently expressing Rz-FGF-BP were not affected with regard to GnRH-mediated EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 1C).We further extended our study to another gonadotropic cell line, LβT2 cells. LβT2 cells express both the α- and β-subunit of leutinizing hormone as well as GnRHR (18Turgeon J.L. Kimura Y. Waring D.W. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 439-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LβT2 cells were pretreated with the gelatinase inhibitor Ro28-2653 or the EGFR-specific tyrphostin AG1478 prior to GnRH treatment and activation of EGFR was analyzed with an antibody recognizing phosphorylation of tyrosine 845. Pretreatment of cells with Ro28-2653 resulted in a decline of EGFR phosphorylation to basal levels. Furthermore, phosphorylation of EGFR was completely blocked by AG1478 pretreatment (Fig. 1D).To investigate whether gelatinases are activated in a GnRH-dependent manner, conditioned αT3-1 cell culture supernatants were concentrated, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and probed with anti-MMP2- or anti-MMP9 antibodies. A 5-min GnRH challenge resulted in enhanced release of MMP2 (Fig. 2, A and B, upper panels). Preincubation of αT3-1 cells with Ro28-2653 decreased the MMP2 contents of the medium as did transfection with ribozymes targeting MMP2 (Fig. 2, A and B, upper panels). On the contrary, transfection of cells with Rz-MMP9, Rz-MMP12, or Rz-FGF-BP had no impact on MMP2 levels (Fig. 2B, upper panel). GnRH stimulation also led to an increase in MMP9 protein levels in the medium (Fig. 2, A and B, lower panels). The release of MMP9 was counteracted by preincubation of cells with Ro28-2653 (Fig. 2A, lower panel) or transfection with Rz-MMP9 (Fig. 2B, lower panel). Targeting MMP2 via Rz-MMP2 entailed a decrease in MMP9 release (Fig. 2B, lower panel) potentially indicating a role for MMP2 in MMP9 activation (31Murphy G. Stanton H. Cowell S. Butler G. Knauper V. Atkinson S. Gavrilovic J. Acta Pathol. Microbiol. Immunol. Scand. 1999; 107: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). MMP12 or FGF-BP do not govern MMP9 activation because down-regulation of these proteins did not inhibit MMP9 activation (Fig. 2B, lower panel).Fig. 2GnRH-mediated gelatinase activation is inhibited by Ro28-2653 as well as targeting gelatinases by ribozymes and MT1-MMP is activated in a GnRH-dependent manner in αT3-1 cells.A, serum-starved αT3-1 cells were preincubated with 10 μm Ro28-2653 for 30 min and subsequently stimulated with 1 μm GnRH for 5 min. Culture media were collected and concentrated. Western blots of samples containing 15 μg of protein were probed with an anti-MMP2 antibody (upper panel) or an antibody directed against MMP9 (lower panel). B, αT3-1 cells were transiently transfected with ribozymes directed against MMP2 (Rz-MMP2), MMP9 (Rz-MMP9), MMP12 (Rz-MMP12), or FGF-BP (Rz-FGF-BP). After serum depletion, cells were stimulated with 1 μm GnRH for 5 min. Culture media were collected and concentrated. Western blots of samples containing 15 μg of protein were probed with an anti-MMP2-(upper panel) or an anti-MMP9 (lower panel) antibody. C, serum-starved αT3-1 cells were preincubated with 10 μm Ro28-2653 for 30 min and subsequently stimulated with 1 μm GnRH for 5 min. Culture media were collected and concentrated. Samples containing 15 μg of protein were subjected to gelatin zymography. Molecular weight markers are indicated at the right. D, serum-starved αT3-1 cells were stimulated with 1 μm GnRH for 5 min. Western blots of cell lysates (upper panel) and concentrated culture medium containing 15 μg of protein (lower panel) were probed with anti-MT1-MMP antibodies. E, αT3-1 cells were transfected with ribozymes directed against MT1-MMP (Rz-MT1-MMP). After serum depletion, cells were stimulated with 1 μm GnRH for 5 min. After collection and concentration of culture media, Western blots of samples containing 15 μg of protein were probed with an anti-MMP2 antibody. F, upper panel, αT3-1 cells were transiently transfected with ribozyme Rz-MT1-MMP. After serum starvation, cells were stimulated with 1 μm GnRH for 5 min. Western blots of cell lysates were probed with an anti-phospho-EGFR antibody. Lower panel, blots were reprobed with an anti-EGFR antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res"

We previously demonstrated that the 24.8.A iNKT cell hybridoma was broadly reactive with CD1d-transfected cell lines and recognized the polar lipid fraction of a tumor cell extract. In the present study, the antigen recognized by the 24.8.A iNKT cell hybridoma was purified to homogeneity and identified as palmitoyl-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (16:0–18:1 PE). The 24.8.A iNKT cell hybridoma recognized synthetic 16:0-18:1[cis] PE, confirming that this phospholipid is antigenic. Recognition correlated with the degree of unsaturation of the acyl chains. Using a panel of synthetic PEs, the 24.8.A iNKT cell hybridoma was shown to be activated by PEs that contained at least one unsaturated acyl chain. The configuration of the double bonds was important, as the 24.8.A iNKT cell hybridoma recognized unsaturated acyl chains in the cis, but not the trans, configuration. PEs with multiple double bonds were recognized better than those with a single double bond, and increasing acyl chain unsaturation correlated with increased binding of PE to CD1d.

The second subset of NKT cells will be referred to as invariant NKT (iNKT) cells. It is this subset that has been implicated in a variety of pathological processes, and activation of iNKT cells promotes host rejection of tumors, ameliorates autoimmune disease, and enhances immunity to certain infectious diseases (1Wang B.

In some cases, the beneficial effects of iNKT cells appear to be mediated by other cell types, and this finding has led to the concept that CD1d-restricted iNKT cells function as immunoregulatory T cells (10Taniguchi M.

Although αGalCer has been extremely useful in elucidating the biology of iNKT cells, little is known about the naturally occurring antigens that are recognized by iNKT cells. To understand how iNKT cells participate in immunity, the physiological antigens recognized by the iNKT cell TCR require identification. Many of the first CD1d-restricted NKT cells studied were self-reactive, and recognized both human and murine CD1d in the absence of exogenously added antigen (14Behar S.M. Podrebarac T.A. Roy C.J.

These include peptides, phosphatidylinositol (PI) and PI-containing compounds, and other phospholipids (17Gumperz J.E. Roy C. Makowska A. Lum D. Sugita M. Podrebarac T. Koezuka Y. Porcelli S.A.

We have previously characterized a panel of CD1d-restricted T cells and T cell hybridomas (both invariant and diverse) that recognize CD1d-transfected cell lines in the absence of exogenously added antigen (14Behar S.M. Podrebarac T.A. Roy C.J. Wang C.R. Brenner M.B. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 161-167PubMed Google Scholar). However, these CD1d-restricted NKT cells are antigen-dependent and some have been shown to recognize endogenous cellular lipid antigens (17Gumperz J.E. Roy C. Makowska A. Lum D. Sugita M.

Using an in vitro assay that was developed for the purpose of antigen discovery, the antigen recognized by the 24.8.A iNKT cell hybridoma was partially purified from RMA-S tumor cells and characterized as a polar lipid (14Behar S.M. Podrebarac T.A. Roy C.J. Wang C.R. Brenner M.B. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 161-167PubMed Google Scholar, 17Gumperz J.E. Roy C. Makowska A. Lum D. Sugita M. Podrebarac T. Koezuka Y. Porcelli S.A.

We have now purified the antigen to homogeneity and identified the antigen as palmitoyl-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (16:0–18:1 phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)). We show that unsaturation of acyl chains is important for recognition and suggest that this is likely because of its effect on lipid packing and the ability of the lipid tails to load into the CD1d binding groove. Materials—Unless stated otherwise, all chemicals were obtained commercially and used without further purification. Dicaproyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (di-6:0 PE), dicapryloyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (di-8:0 PE), dicapryl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (di-10:0 PE), dilauroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (di-12:0 PE), dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (di-14:0 PE), dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (di-16:0 PE), distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (di-18:0 PE), dipalmitoleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (di-16:1[cis] PE), dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (di-18:1[cis] PE), dielaidoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (di-18:[trans] PE), dilinoleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (di-18:2[cis] PE), dilinolenoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (di-18:3[cis] PE), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (16:0–18:1[cis] PE), and 1-stearoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (18:0–18:1[cis] PE) were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids. The number and conformation of the double bonds in the different acyl chains are the following: palmitoleoyl is cis-9-hexadecenoyl; oleoyl is cis-9-octadecenoyl; elaidoyl is trans-9-octadecenoyl; linoleoyl is cis,cis-9,12-octadecadienoyl; and linolenoyl is all cis-9,12,15-octadecatrienoyl. Naturally occurring phospholipids were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Alabaster, AL). Phospholipid stock solutions were prepared in chloroform (CHCl3) and stored at –70 °C. Phospholipid suspensions were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) as follows. Phospholipid in CHCl3, or an equivalent amount of CHCl3 (CHCl3 control), was dried down in a round-bottomed glass tube under nitrogen gas. Me2SO was added to the lipid film, and the sample was then vortexed vigorously and redissolved at 30–40 °C (unless otherwise specified) for 20 min in a sonicator bath. Phospholipid concentrations were determined by the method of Bartlett (20Bartlett C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 243: 466-468Google Scholar). Cells and Cell Lines—The CD1d-restricted 24.8 iNKT cell clone and the 24.8.A iNKT hybridoma, both of which express a TCR encoded by the invariant TCRα (Vα14-Jα281) and Vβ8.2 genes, have been previously described (14Behar S.M. Podrebarac T.A. Roy C.J. Wang C.R. Brenner M.B. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 161-167PubMed Google Scholar, 17Gumperz J.E. Roy C. Makowska A. Lum D. Sugita M. Podrebarac T. Koezuka Y. Porcelli S.A. Cardell S. Brenner M.B. Behar S.M. Immunity. 2000; 12: 211-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). The RMA-S cell line was derived from the RBL-5 T cell lymphoma and has a defective transporter associated with antigen processing-2 (TAP2) gene, which disrupts its MHC class I processing pathway (21Ljunggren H.G. Ohlen C. Hoglund P. Franksson L. Karre K. Int. J. Cancer Suppl. 1991; 6: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It also expresses low levels of endogenous CD1d and does not express cell surface MHC class II protein. Fractionation of Lipids—As previously described, total cellular lipid was isolated from RMA-S cells and fractionated into neutral lipids, glycolipids, and phospholipids, by sequential elution of the lipid from a silica column using solvents of increasing polarity (17Gumperz J.E. Roy C. Makowska A. Lum D. Sugita M. Podrebarac T. Koezuka Y. Porcelli S.A. Cardell S. Brenner M.B. Behar S.M. Immunity. 2000; 12: 211-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). The strategy used to purify and identify the antigen was selected based on our initial observation that the relevant antigen was enriched in the phospholipid-containing methanol fraction (17Gumperz J.E. Roy C. Makowska A. Lum D. Sugita M. Podrebarac T. Koezuka Y. Porcelli S.A. Cardell S. Brenner M.B. Behar S.M. Immunity. 2000; 12: 211-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). The methanol-eluted fraction was separated by two-dimensional thin layer chromatography (TLC) using 500 μm silica gel-coated plates (Scientific Adsorbants, Inc, Atlanta, GA). The first dimension was resolved with 60:35:6 chloroform/methanol/water, and the second dimension was run in 40:25:3:6 chloroform/acetic acid/methanol/water. Areas containing lipids were detected using water mist, scraped, and eluted with 2:1 CHCl3/methanol to extract lipids. Certain low abundance lipids were detected with iodine vapor and then extracted in the same way. Eluted lipids were assayed for stimulation of T cells and highly bioactive fractions were used to determine the structure of the antigen by mass spectrometry. Mass Spectrometric Analysis of the Antigens—Structural analysis was performed on lipid fractions capable of stimulating the 24.8.A iNKT hybridoma. Electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry experiments were performed on a Quattro II triple quadrupole (Micromass) mass spectrometer to acquire both single stage (MS) and tandem (MS/MS) data at unit mass resolution. Accurate mass determinations were performed using an IonSpec Ultima Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer with a 7T actively shielded superconducting magnet, also using electrospray ionization. Plate-bound mCD1d Hybridoma Stimulation Assay for T Cell Recognition of Phospholipids—Purification of the mCD1d fusion protein was as previously described (17Gumperz J.E. Roy C. Makowska A. Lum D. Sugita M. Podrebarac T. Koezuka Y. Porcelli S.A. Cardell S. Brenner M.B. Behar S.M. Immunity. 2000; 12: 211-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). The plate-bound mCD1d fusion protein hybridoma stimulation assay was performed as previously described (17Gumperz J.E. Roy C. Makowska A. Lum D. Sugita M. Podrebarac T. Koezuka Y. Porcelli S.A. Cardell S. Brenner M.B. Behar S.M. Immunity. 2000; 12: 211-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar), with the exception that protein G-coated plates (Pierce) were used in place of protein A-coated plates. This assay will be referred to hereafter as the plate-bound CD1 assay. Briefly, phospholipid antigens diluted in PBS were added to the wells of a protein G-coated plate, followed by mCD1d fusion protein (0.5-1.0 μg/well in PBS). Following incubation of the plates for 24 h at 37 °C, the plates were washed with PBS and medium. 24.8.A iNKT hybridoma cells were added to the coated wells at a concentration of 1 × 105 cells/well in a total volume of 150 μl/well. Assays were performed using 3 replicate wells and repeated a minimum of twice. Controls included wells coated with anti-CD3 (positive) or PBS (negative). In some experiments, anti-CD1d (19G11), anti-MHC I (M1/42.3.9.8.HLK), or anti-MHC II (M5/114.15.2) blocking monoclonal antibody was included at a concentration of 20 μg/ml. The coefficient of variation between replicate wells was generally <10%. Competitive mCD1d Phospholipid Binding Assay—A competitive phospholipid binding assay was developed to evaluate the ability of phospholipids to compete with biotinylated di-18:0 PE bound to streptavidin-coated plates for binding to mCD1d. The concentrations of biotinylated di-18:0 PE and mCD1d used in this assay were selected to fall on the linear portion of their binding curve. Immulon-2 (Dynatech, Chantilly, VA) plates were coated for ∼16 h at 4 °C with 5 μg/ml streptavidin (ICN, Irvine, CA) in 0.015 m sodium carbonate buffer, pH 9.6. The coated plates were washed 3 times with PBS and then blocked with PBS containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen, Burlington, ON) and 0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h at 25 °C. Following three washes with PBS, 30 μl of biotinylated di-18:0 PE (Northern Lipids, Vancouver, BC), diluted to 50 μg/ml in 0.01 m Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4 (TBS), was added to the blocked steptavidin-coated wells and incubated for 1 h at 25 °C. Competitive binding samples for the assay were prepared by incubating 30 μl of phospholipid competitors, diluted from the Me2SO stock solution into TBS containing 0.1% ovalbumin (assay buffer), with 20 μl of purified mCD1d (approximate final concentration of 4 μg/ml). The samples were incubated in borosilicate glass tubes for 16 h at 37 °C. 50 μl of the competitor/CD1 solution were added in duplicate to the blocked streptavidin-coated plates, and incubated for 4 h at 25 °C. The plates were washed four times with PBS. Bound mCD1d was detected by the addition of alkaline phosphatase-conjugated human-absorbed goat anti-mouse IgG (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Birmingham, AL), diluted at 1:1000 in PBS containing 0.4% bovine serum albumin, and incubation for 16 h at 4 °C. A colored reaction was developed by adding p-nitrophenol phosphate substrate (Sigma) and developing for ∼20 min at 37 °C. The OD405 was read in an ELISA reader (Titertek Multiskan MCC/340, Flow Systems, Huntsville, AL). The coefficient of variation between replicate wells was generally <10%. Purification and Identification of Palmitoyl-oleoyl PE as the RMA-S Antigen Recognized by the 24.8.A iNKT Cell Hybridoma—Previous studies had shown that the iNKT cell hybridoma 24.8.A was most potently stimulated by the phospholipid-enriched methanol fraction of RMA-S cellular lipids (17Gumperz J.E. Roy C. Makowska A. Lum D. Sugita M. Podrebarac T. Koezuka Y. Porcelli S.A. Cardell S. Brenner M.B. Behar S.M. Immunity. 2000; 12: 211-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). To determine the identity of the natural antigens, the methanol fraction was further fractionated by two-dimensional TLC, which yielded 20 distinct lipid species (data not shown). Ten spots were visualized based on the exclusion of a fine water mist (spots 1–10), and a further ten spots were visualized using iodine vapor (spots 11–20). The silica corresponding to each spot was scraped and the lipids eluted with CHCl3/methanol. The ability of each of these fractions to stimulate the 24.8.A NKT cell hybridoma was tested using the plate-bound CD1 assay. One of the fractions (fraction 7) strongly stimulated the 24.8.A iNKT cell hybridoma to produce IL-2 in the plate-bound CD1d assay, similar to the original methanol fraction (Fig. 1). Plate-bound CD1d alone, in the presence of PBS, showed little or no reactivity. To determine the identity of the reactive lipid, fraction 7 was analyzed by negative ion mass spectrometry. It contained a single isotopic cluster with the nominal mass per unit charge of m/z 716. The accurate mass m/z 716.5233 was determined (calc. m/z 716.5236 for the C39H75NO8P– anion). Deuterium exchange experiments indicated that two exchangeable protons were present (data not shown). Both of these findings are consistent with the structure of palmitoyl-oleoyl PE. Further structural analysis of this anion by collision-induced decomposition (CID) MS/MS revealed fragments at m/z 255 and m/z 281, consistent with the presence of 16:0 and 18:1 acyl chains (Fig. 2a). At slightly higher energy, fragmentation of the glycerol backbone or the glycerophosphate bond resulted in fragments at m/z 196 [C3H5OPO4CH2CH2NH2]– and m/z 140 [HPO4CH2CH2NH2], which are characteristic of PEs (Fig. 2b) (22Smith P.B. Snyder A.P. Harden C.S. Anal. Chem. 1995; 67: 1824-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Comparison of the MS/MS data to data in the literature for the two possible isomers, where carboxylate anion were preferentially generated from the sn-2 position during low energy CID of PEs, indicates that the 18:1 acyl group is located at the sn-2 position, although a mixture with lower levels of the other isomer cannot be ruled out (22Smith P.B. Snyder A.P. Harden C.S. Anal. Chem. 1995; 67: 1824-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). 1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (16:0–18:1[cis] PE) is postulated as the most probable structure (Fig. 2c). To confirm that 16:0–18:1[cis] PE was an antigen recognized by the 24.8.A iNKT cell hybridoma, synthetic 16:0–18:1[cis]PE was obtained and evaluated in the plate-bound CD1 assay. Synthetic 16:0–18:1[cis] PE was recognized by the 24.8.A iNKT cell hybridoma and its recognition was completely blocked by antibodies specific for CD1d (Fig. 3). Antibodies specific for MHC I or MHC II did not block antigen recognition. These data indicate that PE is an endogenous self-lipid antigen that can be presented by CD1d to the self-reactive 24.8.A iNKT cell hybridoma. The 24.8.A iNKT Cell Hybridoma Recognizes Microbial, Mammalian, and Plant PEs—Once it was confirmed that PE was an endogenous antigen recognized by the 24.8.A iNKT cell hybridoma, we systematically examined reactivity to naturally occurring PEs. These included PE from the bacterium, Escherichia coli. We were particularly interested in bacterial PE, as many species of bacteria modify the acyl chains of their phospholipids through cyclopropanation and cis → trans isomerization. These modifications are not commonly reported in eukaryotic cells and can affect recognition of lipid antigens by CD1-restricted iNKT cells (23Cronan Jr., J.E. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2002; 5: 202-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 24Grant E.P. Beckman E.M. Behar S.M. Degano M. Frederique D. Besra G.S. Wilson I.A. Porcelli S.A. Furlong S.T. Brenner M.B. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 3933-3940Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Plant PE was recognized most strongly, followed by bovine brain PE and egg PE, heart PE, and liver PE (Fig. 4). PE from E. coli was recognized by the 24.8.A iNKT cell hybridoma, but not better than PEs from plant or animal sources. The degree of recognition of E. coli PE was similar to that of liver PE. In general, we found that most sources of natural PEs were well recognized, and the degree of recognition correlated with the percentage of 18:1 + 18:2 + 18:3 acyl chains for the PEs for which this information is known (Fig. 4). For example, plant PE was the most potent activator of the 24.8.A iNKT cell hybridoma and has 73.2% of its acyl chains (18:1, 18:2, and 18:3) unsaturated. In contrast, liver PE was the least potent activator and contained only 14.7% unsaturated 18-carbon acyl chains. This observation led us to more carefully examine the role of the acyl chains in recognition of antigen by the 24.8.A hybridoma using a panel of synthetic PE. Fatty Acyl Chain Unsaturation Is Critical for Recognition of PE—The paradigm for binding of lipid antigens to CD1 is that the acyl chains are buried deep in the hydrophobic cleft formed by the CD1 α1 and α3 domains, leaving the polar head group exposed on the surface of the molecule, a model confirmed by the crystal structure of murine CD1d, human CD1a, and human CD1b (25Beckman E.M.

Immunol. 2002; 168: 5514-5520Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Furthermore, alteration of the polar head group of the lipid antigen or the polar amino acid residues in the TCRβ CDR3 region both have a dramatic effect on TCR-dependent recognition of the antigen (24Grant E.P. Beckman E.M. Behar S.M. Degano M. Frederique D. Besra G.S. Wilson I.A. Porcelli S.A. Furlong S.T. Brenner M.B. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 3933-3940Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 30Moody D.B.

Science. 1997; 278: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). However, changes in the structure of acyl chains can also affect T cell recognition and lipid antigen processing (31Moody D.B. Briken V. Cheng T.Y. Roura-Mir C. Guy M.R. Geho D.H. Tykocinski M.L. Besra G.S. Porcelli S.A. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 32Niazi K. Chiu M. Mendoza R.

The plate-bound CD1d assay detects the recognition of PE by the 24.8.A T iNKT cell hybridoma independently of antigen processing. As the lipid antigen is not processed and recognition depends only on the direct binding of the phospholipid to the CD1d fusion protein, we were able to determine the effect of different acyl chains on recognition of PE by the 24.8.A iNKT cell hybridoma. To determine the effect of length and saturation of the fatty acyl chains on recognition of PE by the 24.8.A iNKT cell hybridoma, we first examined a series of synthetic saturated 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamines (Fig. 5b). Although the chain length varied between 6 and 18 carbons, none of the saturated diacyl PEs was recognized, with the exception of di-12:0 PE. As the PE purified from RMA-S cells (i.e. 16:0–18:1 PE) contained one monounsaturated acyl chain, we next examined whether PEs containing unsaturated acyl chains were better recognized than those containing saturated acyl chains. We first evaluated PEs containing acyl chains with a single double bond. Both di-16:1[cis] PE and di-18:1[cis] PE were recognized by the 24.8.A iNKT cell hybridoma, while PEs with saturated acyl chains of the same length (di-16:0 and di-18:0, respectively) were not (Fig. 5c). Furthermore, the introduction of a second double bond conferred greater recognition upon the PE, as shown by di-18:2[cis] PE (Fig. 5d). The introduction of a third double bond in each acyl chain, however, as in di-18:3[cis] PE, did not improve upon the recognition observed with di-18: 2[cis] PE. Since the RMA-S cell-derived antigen, 16:0–18:1 PE, contained mixed fatty acyl chains, we next investigated the reactivity of synthetic PEs with two different fatty acyl chains. Although di-16:0 PE and di-18:0 PE were not recognized, 16:0–18:1[cis] PE and 18:0–18:1[cis] PE were both well recognized, demonstrating that the presence of a single acyl chain containing one double bond can confer recognition (Fig. 5e). Interestingly, the stereochemistry of the double bond had a great impact upon recognition by the 24.8.A iNKT cell hybridoma. We evaluated two different isomers of di-18:1 PE, di-18: 1[cis] PE (cis isomer) and di-18:1[trans] PE (trans isomer). Chemically, these two forms differ only in the stereochemistry of the single double bond in the acyl chains, either cis or trans. However, structurally, these isomers take on very different forms in aqueous suspension at 37 °C: di-18:1[cis] PE is in the hexagonal HII phase, while di-18:1[trans] PE is in the lamellar phase (33Tilcock C.P.S. Cullis P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 684: 212-218Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We found that di-18:1[cis] PE was well recognized, while di-18:1[trans] PE was not recognized (Fig. 5f). The structures for di-18:0 PE, di-18:1[trans] PE, di-18:1[cis] PE, and di-18:2[cis] PE are shown in Fig. 5a. The 24.8.A iNKT cell hybridoma recognized structures with one or more double bonds in one or both acyl chains, but only if the double bonds were in the cis configuration. The Phase"

CITED2 is inducible by varying stimuli including lipopolysaccharide, hypoxia, and cytokines such as interleukin 9 and interferon γ. Using the immortalized human chondrocyte cell line, C-28/I2, we investigated whether CITED2 could be responsive to mechanical stimuli, and if so, whether CITED2 could mediate shear-driven regulation of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) genes. The C-28/I2 cells were cultured under flow shear at 1–20 dyn/cm2, and the role of CIT-ED2 in regulation of MMPs was examined using the plasmids encoding sense and antisense CITED2 DNA sequences. The results showed that flow shear at 5 dyn/cm2 increased CITED2 mRNA and protein levels and down-regulated MMP-1 and MMP-13 mRNA and protein levels as well as enzyme activities. Consistent with the coordinated expression patterns of CITED2 and MMPs, overexpression of CITED2 repressed MMP-1 and MMP-13 mRNA levels and activities, whereas antisense CITED2 plasmids prevented the shear-induced down-regulation of MMP expression. Interleukin-1β induced the formation of p300-Ets-1 complexes without affecting expression of CITED2. Transforming growth factor-β as well as flow shear at 5 dyn/cm2 stimulated not only the expression of CITED2 but also the association of CIT-ED2 with p300 by dissociating Ets-1 from p300. These results indicate that CITED2 plays a major role in shear-induced down-regulation of MMP-1 and MMP-13 via a transforming growth factor-β-dependent pathway.

Chondrocytes in cartilage experience a variety of stresses, strains, and pressure that result from normal activities of daily living. Determining how shear stress alters chondrocyte metabolism is fundamental to understanding how to limit matrix destruction and stimulate cartilage repair and regeneration (31Lane Smith R.

In inflammatory joint diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, MMPs are considered pivotal proteinases of cartilage degradation. Because IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor-α are known to stimulate the expression and activities of MMPs, cytokine antagonists and receptor-blocking antibodies have been studied as potential agents for blocking cartilage destruction in joint diseases (9Goldring M.B.

Transcription factors such as Ets-1, NFκB, and Stat2 not only bind DNA directly but also interact with CREB-binding protein (CBP) and p300 (15Vo N. Goodman R.H. J. Biol.

CBP and p300 are transcriptional co-activators, and they play a critical role in many cellular functions through interactions with TFIIB and RNA polymerase II as well as regulatory transcription factors (16Goodman R.H.

Recently, a new family of transcriptional co-regulators, the CITED (CBP/p300-interacting transactivator with ED-rich tail) family, was discovered. These factors interact with the first cysteine-histidine-rich (CH1) region of CBP/p300 (17Yahata T. de Caestecker M.P. Lechleider R.J. Andriole S. Roberts A.B. Isselbacher K.J. Shioda T. J. Biol.

Recent studies have shown that CITED2 is involved in regulation of stress-responsive genes such as HIF1 and LIM (21Yin Z. Haynie J. Yang X. Han B. Kiatchoosakun S. Restivo J. Yuan S. Prabhakar N.R.

To our knowledge, however, the role of CITED in mechanical stress and regulation of MMPs has not been investigated. MMP-1 and MMP-13 are collagenases whose expression is elevated in inflamed joints (22Konttinen Y.T. Ainola M. Valleala H. Ma J. Ida H. Mandelin J. Kinne R.W. Santavirta S. Sorsa T. Lopez-Otin C.

Thus, we investigated whether CITED2 could be induced by flow shear in chondrocytes and, if so, whether CITED2 could mediate the down-regulation of MMP expression and activities in response to flow shear. As a reproducible model, we used the C-28/I2 chondrocyte cell line and analyzed MMP-1 and MMP-13 mRNA levels and enzyme activities after application of flow shear with intensity up to 20 dyn/cm2. Our results using the sense and antisense CITED2 plasmids, overexpressed in the C-28/I2 cells prior to application of flow shear, support the critical role of CITED2 in flow shear-induced down-regulation of MMP-1 and MMP-13. Ets-1 is responsive to IL-1 and known to activate the transcription of many MMPs (24Wasylyk C. Gutman A. Nicholson R. Wasylyk B.

In this report, we have identified a mechanism whereby IL-1β and inflammatory flow shear at 20 dyn/cm2 facilitate association of Ets-1 with p300 and TGF-β and anti-inflammatory flow shear at 5 dyn/cm2 stimulate formation of p300-CITED2 complexes. Cell Culture—The immortalized human chondrocyte cell line, C-28/I2, was used for this study (27Goldring M.B. Birkhead J.R. Suen L.F. Yamin R. Mizuno S. Glowacki J. Arbiser J.L. Apperley J.F. J. Clin.

Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2000; 8: 96-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The use of human cell cultures was approved by the Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis Institutional Committee. Cells were plated on a glass slide coated with 2 μg/ml type I collagen and grown to reach ∼70% confluency in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. After a mild starvation in medium containing 1% serum for 18 h, the cells were exposed to 1-h flow shear at intensity of <20 dyn/cm2 in a Streamer Gold flow device (Flexcell International). In some experiments, the cells were incubated with recombinant human IL-1β (Calbiochem) or TGF-β (Calbiochem) at concentrations of 5–100 ng/ml for 0–6 h. Transfection of Sense and Antisense CITED2 Plasmids—Expression vectors containing the sense or antisense CITED2 DNA sequences were constructed in pcDNA3.1 to examine the function of CITED2 (Fig. 1). Sequences from the coding region of human CITED2 DNA was amplified by PCR using the primers containing EcoRI and BamHI sites, and the amplified fragments were subcloned into the pcDNA3.1 vector. The sense CITED2 plasmid (pcDNA3.1-CITED2S) was used to overexpress CITED2, and the antisense CITED2 plasmid (pcDNA3.1-CITED2AS) was designed to block translation of CITED2 mRNA. The plasmids were transfected in chondrocytes at a concentration of 0.1 or 1 μg of DNA/2 × 105 cells using the Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen). In a parallel experiment using pIRES-EGFP plasmids (5.3 kb), transfection efficiency was estimated as 14.1 + 2.2% (0.1 μg of DNA) and 46.7 + 2.4% (1.0 μg of DNA). The CITED2 protein level was determined by immunoblotting using the antibody specific for CITED2. Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—RT-PCR was conducted to determine the mRNA levels of CITED2, MMP-1, and MMP-13. Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) and reverse-transcribed with random hexamers. Semi-quantitative PCR was performed by hot-start at 94 °C for 5 min using the primers listed in Table I. We employed 32 PCR cycles with a temperature profile at 94 °C for denaturation (1 min), 55–65 °C for annealing (1 min), and 72 °C for extension (45 s to 1 min, 30 s). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as RT-PCR control. To further quantify the effects of shear and/or IL-1β on MMP-1 mRNA and MMP-13 mRNA, real-time PCR was conducted using ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system (PE Applied Biosystems) as described previously (30Sun H.B. Yokota H. Matrix Biol. 2002; 21: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The primers were 5′-CTCAATTTCACTTCTGTTTTCTG-3′ and 5′-CATCTCTGTCGGCAAATTCGT-3′ (MMP-1) and 5′-AAGGAGCATGGCGACTTCT-3′ and 5′-TGGCCCAGGAGGAAAAGC-3′ (MMP-13). The fluorescent probes were 5′-FAM-CACAACTGCCAAATGGGCTTGAAGC-TAMRA-3′ (MMP-1) and 5′-FAM-CCTCTGGCCTGCTGGCTC-TAMRA-3′ (MMP-13). A threshold cycle was determined to estimate differences in the starting cDNA copy number with and without IL-1β and/or the shear treatment. GAPDH was used as an internal control with the primers and the probe in the TaqMan assay control kit (PE Applied Biosystems).Table IPCR primers used in the studyGeneSense primerAntisense primerSizebpCITED25′-GGCGGCTCTGGCAGCAGCTC-3′5′-CGGGCAGCTCCTTGATGCGG-3′205MMP-15′-CACAGCTTTCCTCCACTGCTGCTGC-3′5′-GGCATGGTCCACATCTGCTCTTGGC-3′396MMP-135′-TGGTGGTGATGAAGATGATTTGTCT-3′5′-AGTTACATCGGACCAAACTTTGAAG-3′376GAPDH5′-CCACCCATGGCAAATTCCATGGCA-3′5′-TCTAGACGGCAGGTCAGGTCCACC-3′598 Open table in a new tab Immunoblot/Immunoprecipitation Assay—An immunoblot assay was performed by using antibodies specific for MMP-1 (Calbiochem), MMP-13 (Calbiochem), and CITED2. The primary antibodies for MMP-1 and MMP-13 recognized both the latent and active forms. Approximately 10 μg of the extracted proteins were separated by electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) in a 10% polyacrylamide gel, and the separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond, Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies followed by incubation with secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (ECL Western blotting analysis system, Amersham Biosciences). The expected molecular sizes were 42/46 kDa (MMP-1), 48/60 kDa (MMP-13), and 28 kDa (CITED2). A mouse antibody specific for β-actin (42 kDa, Sigma) was used as loading control. For immunoprecipitation, 100 μg of nuclear extracts were mixed with 8 μg of p300-specific antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) and incubated with gentle rocking at 4 °C overnight. The immunocomplexes were captured by mixing with protein G-agarose beads for 2 h at 4 °C. The collected agarose beads were washed four times with an ice-cold cell lysis buffer, and the precipitated proteins were eluted by boiling the beads for 5 min in the SDS sample buffer. Fractions of the supernatant were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using antibodies against p300, CITED2, and Ets-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The expected molecular sizes of p300 and Ets-1 were 300 and 54 kDa, respectively. MMP Activity Assay—MMP activities were determined using fluorophore-labeled substrates specific for MMP-1 or MMP-13 and collagenases or gelatinases (Molecular Probes) (30Sun H.B. Yokota H. Matrix Biol. 2002; 21: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The proteins isolated from the culture medium were incubated with the fluorescent substrates in a reaction buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, and 0.2 mm sodium azide at room temperature for 2 h. Fluorescent intensity, a measure of MMP activity, was determined by a FluoroMax-2 spectrofluorometer (Instruments S. A., Inc.). An absorption/emission wavelength was set to 382/441 nm (MMP-1), 325/393 nm (MMP-13), and 495/515 nm (collagenases and gelatinases). The culture medium itself exhibited basal MMP activity that was ∼5% of that in the medium incubated with control cells. Data Analysis—All of the experiments were performed three times. To examine statistically significant changes in the levels of mRNAs, proteins, and MMP activities, a Student's t test was conducted using StatView software (version 5.0, SAS Institute Inc.) and p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. MMP-1 and MMP-13 mRNA, Protein Levels, and Enzyme Activities Were Altered by Flow Shear—The C-28/I2 cells expressed constitutive levels of MMP-1 and MMP-13 mRNA that could be detected by the sensitive RT-PCR technique under the conditions of culture. The levels of mRNA were reflected in the protein levels detected by immunoblotting and the respective enzyme activities. In response to flow shear at 0 (control), 1, 2, 5, 10, and 20 dyn/cm2 for 1 h, MMP-1 and MMP-13 mRNA, protein levels, and enzyme activities were modulated in a stress intensity-dependent manner (Fig. 2). Low intensities of shear at 1 and 2 dyn/cm2 had no effect, whereas shear at 5 dyn/cm2 reduced significantly (p < 0.05) the MMP-1 and 13 mRNA levels (Fig. 2A), protein levels (Fig. 2B), and enzyme activities (Fig. 2C). The antibody against MMP-1 detected the active form (46 kDa), and the antibody against MMP-13 identified both the active form (48 kDa) and the proenzyme (60 kDa). However, increasing the shear to 10 dyn/cm2 resulted in less inhibition, whereas a further elevation to 20 dyn/cm2 increased protein and activity levels of these collagenases but did not change the mRNA levels relative to controls. MMP-1 responses to shear at both 5 and 20 dyn/cm2 were altered to a greater extent than MMP-13. A positive correlation was observed in Fig. 2 between the mRNA level and the protein level with r (correlation coefficient) = 0.75 and between the protein level and the activity level with r = 0.89. We determined not only the protein level but also the activity level, because both MMP-1 and MMP-13 need to be post-translationally modified for activation. Increased Expression of CITED2 in Response to Flow Shear at 5 dyn/cm2—CITED2 is a transcriptional activator known to be inducible by many biological stresses, but no study on the responses to mechanical stress has been conducted previously. Thus, we wished to determine whether CITED2 could be expressed in chondrocytes in response to flow shear. The C-28/I2 cells expressed detectable levels of CITED2 mRNA and proteins as shown in Fig. 3. Application of flow shear at 5 dyn/cm2 for 1 h increased CITED2 mRNA and protein levels by 1.9- and 2.0-fold, respectively. However, flow shear at 10 or 20 dyn/cm2 did not alter either mRNA or protein level relative to controls (Fig. 3). These data indicate that the induction of CITED2 expression occurs at the same level of fluid sheer, 5 dyn/cm2, that causes down-regulation of MMP expression. Suppression of the Levels of MMP-1 and MMP-13 mRNA, Protein, and Enzyme Activities by Overexpression of CIT-ED2—To examine the role of CITED2 in regulation of MMP-1 and MMP-13, we overexpressed CITED2 in C-28/I2 cells. Transfection of pcDNA3.1-CITED2S elevated the mRNA protein levels of CITED2, and the increases were dependent on the dosage of plasmids used for transfection. A 10-fold increase in the amount of plasmid DNA raised transfection efficiency by 3.3-fold (Fig. 4, A and B). The MMP-1 and MMP-13 mRNA levels and enzyme activities were reduced by overexpression of CITED2 (Fig. 4, A and C). Compared with the cells transfected with the empty pcDNA3.1 vector, transfection of the sense CITED2 plasmids at 0.1 and 1 μg/2 × 105 cells reduced MMP-1 enzyme activity by 43 and 66% and MMP-13 activity by 23 and 43%, respectively. Loss of Shear-induced Repression of MMP-1 Expression after Overexpression of Antisense CITED2—To determine whether flow shear-induced CITED2 was indeed capable of suppressing MMP-1 expression, we transfected antisense CITED2 in the C-28/I2 cells for 72 h followed by application of flow shear at 5 dyn/cm2 for 1 h. The antisense plasmid reduced the level of CITED2 protein by 81% in control cells and 80% in sheartreated cells at 5 dyn/cm2 (Fig. 5A). In the cells transfected with the empty vector alone, the expression of CITED2 was not altered either in the presence or absence of flow shear (Fig. 5A). However, the level of MMP-1 mRNA was increased by overexpression of antisense CITED2 in either the absence or presence of flow shear (Fig. 5B). Suppression of IL-1β-stimulated MMP-1 and MMP-13 mRNA Levels and Enzyme Activities by Flow Shear—IL-1β is known to up-regulate the expression and activities of many members of the MMP family in connective tissues. In response to IL-1β, we observed that the constitutive mRNA levels of MMP-1 and MMP-13 were further elevated. Consistent with the expected anti-catabolic effects of flow shear at 5 dyn/cm2, the IL-1β-stimulated mRNA levels were significantly reduced by flow shear. In the real-time PCR assay, the MMP-1 mRNA levels were 4.3-fold (IL-1β), 0.4-fold (shear at 5 dyn/cm2), and 1.9-fold (IL-1β and shear at 5 dyn/cm2) of the level in control cells (Fig. 6A). Similarly, MMP-1, MMP-13, gelatinases, and collagenases enzyme activities were all up-regulated by IL-1β, whereas the IL-1β-driven increases in MMP activities were suppressed by flow shear (Fig. 6B). The average percentages of reduction in MMP activities were 45% (with IL-1β) and 24% (without IL-1β). CITED2 Expression in C-28/I2 Chondrocytes Was Unaltered by IL-1β but Activated by TGF-β—We wished to determine whether the anti-catabolic effects of CITED2 were via modulation of IL-1β expression or TGF-β expression in C-28/I2 chondrocytes. After a 1-h incubation with IL-1β at a concentration of 5, 25, 50, and 100 ng/ml, the level of CITED2 mRNA was unchanged (Fig. 7A). Furthermore, the level of CITED2 mRNA was not affected by incubation with 25 ng/ml IL-1β for up to 4 h (Fig. 7B). On the other hand, a 1-h incubation with TGF-β at a concentration of 5, 25, 50, and 100 ng/ml elevated the mRNA level of CITED2 (Fig. 7C). The elevated level of CITED2 mRNA after a 30-min incubation with 25 ng/ml TGF-β was maintained at least for up to 4 h (Fig. 7D). The mRNA level of MMP-1 was undetectable in the presence of TGF-β (data not shown). Formation of p300-Ets-1 Complexes by IL-1β and Inflammatory Shear at 20 dyn/cm2 and Formation of p300-CITED2 Complexes by TGF-β and Anti-inflammatory Shear at 5 dyn/cm2— Because CITED2 and Ets-1 are known to interact with p300, we determined whether IL-1β or TGF-β, which have opposite effects on MMP expression, could modulate the interactions with this cofactor. The C-28/I2 cells were incubated with 25 ng/ml IL-1 β or 25 ng/ml TGF-β for 1 h. Nuclear extracts were prepared and incubated with the antibody specific for p300 to immunoprecipitate p300 protein complexes. Western blotting identified equal amounts of p300 in control and treated extracts (Fig. 8). In control cells, no p300-Ets-1 or p300-CITED2 complex was detectable. In contrast, p300-Ets-1 complexes were detected in the extracts from IL-1β-treated cells and cells under flow shear at 20 dyn/cm2 and p300-CITED2 complexes were identified in the TGF-β-treated cells and cells under flow shear at 5 dyn/cm2. These results suggest that CITED2 mediates TGF-β-dependent effects on gene transcription via protein-protein interactions with p300. In this study, we provide evidence that CITED2 is a shear-responsive transcriptional mediator in chondrocytes and that it plays a critical role in reducing expression and activity of MMP-1 and MMP-13 at intensities of flow shear that are physiologically relevant (31Lane Smith R. Trindade M.C. Ikenoue T. Mohtai M. Das P. Carter D.R. Goodman S.B. Schurman D.J. Biorheology. 2000; 37: 95-107PubMed Google Scholar). We used the immortalized human chondrocyte cell line, C-28/I2, which has served as a reproducible model for examining intracellular signaling and gene transcriptional mechanisms relevant to chondrocyte functions (28Loeser R.F.

J. 2003; 369: 103-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Our results clearly show that CITED2 mRNA and protein levels are elevated most effectively by shear stress at 5 dyn/cm2 and that this shear intensity down-regulates expression and activities of MMP-1 and MMP-13. A positive correlation between the MMP protein level and the activity level indicates that expression of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases, a natural inhibitor of MMPs, does not overturn the shear-induced regulation of MMP-1 and MMP-13. Overexpression of CITED2 results in the reduction of expression of MMP-1 and MMP-13, and transfection of antisense CITED2 suppresses the shear-induced down-regulation of MMPs. Because association of CITED2 with p300 is affected by TGF-β but not by IL-1β, the CITED2-mediated mechanical responses leading to down-regulation of MMP-1 and MMP-13 expression appear to be regulated by the TGF-β signaling pathway. The observed anti-inflammatory effects of mechanical stimuli are consistent with previous studies in various cell types, although excessive mechanical loads elevate expression of MMPs in chondrocytes (35Honda K.

In peridontal ligament cells, 6–10% of mechanical strain was shown to reduce IL-1β-induced expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-8 (8Long P. Hu J. Piesco N. Buckley M. Agarwal S. J. Dent. Res. 2001; 80: 1416-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Expression of MMP-1 was decreased by 1–4% of strain in vascular smooth muscle cells and by 6% of strain in fibrochondrocytes (36Yang J.H. Briggs W.H. Libby P. Lee R.T. J. Biol.

Using synovial cells, we have shown previously that mechanical stimuli such as small strain at ∼1% and flow shear at ∼2 dyn/cm2 are effective in reducing expression and activities of MMPs induced by IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α (30Sun H.B. Yokota H. Matrix Biol. 2002; 21: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Elucidation of the molecular mechanism underlying the CIT-ED2-mediated down-regulation of MMP-1 and MMP-13 requires investigation of the interactions of CITED2 with p300/CBP and many transcription factors that control MMP promoter activities by interacting with p300/CBP, such as c-Fos, Ets-1, NFκB, and SMAD family members (16Goodman R.H.

Chem. 2002; 277: 20399-20408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In our previous studies using human synovial cells, the mRNA expression of c-Fos and Ets-1 was responsive to mechanical stimuli and the response was dependent on shear intensity (7Sun H.B. Yokota H. Bone (NY). 2001; 28: 303-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In computational simulations where the expression of MMPs in response to mechanical stimuli was modeled using multiple transcription-factor binding motifs, the PEA3 binding motif, which is recognized by Ets-1, was identified as a stimulatory factor (12Qian L. Liu Y. Sun H.B. Yokota H. Front Biosci. 2002; 7: a126-a134Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In the same model, the AP-2 binding motif was predicted as an inhibitory factor that is known to be activated by CITED2 (19Bamforth S.D. Braganca J. Eloranta J.J. Murdoch J.N. Marques F.I. Kranc K.R. Farza H. Henderson D.J. Hurst H.C. Bhattacharya S. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 469-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Taken together, these experimental and computational results suggest that CITED2 could orchestrate the expression of MMPs by regulating interactions between p300 and other transcription factors that either down-regulate (AP-2) or up-regulate (Ets-1 and NFκB) MMP gene expression. The multifunctional p300/CBP has been shown to play a major role in SMAD-dependent TGF-β stimulation of the type I collagen promoter (38Ghosh A.K. Yuan W. Mori Y. Varga J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3546-3555Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Our studies suggest that CITED2 provides an alternative mechanism of TGF-β-induced metabolic responses. The observed link of the CITED2-mediated reduction in MMP expression to the TGF-β pathway is consistent with the known role of TGF-β in down-regulation of MMP-1 expression (28Loeser R.F. Sadiev S. Tan L. Goldring M.B. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2000; 8: 96-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). TGF-β leads to dissociation of Ets-1 from the p300/CBP complexes (26Czuwara-Ladykowska J. Sementchenko V.I. Watson D.K. Trojanowska M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20399-20408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and TGF-β-null mice develop uncontrolled inflammation and joint destruction (18Shull M.M. Ormsby I. Kier A.B. Pawlowski S. Diebold R.J. Yin M. Allen R. Sidman C. Proetzel G. Calvin D. Annunziata N. Doetschman T. Nature. 1992; 359: 693-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (2586) Google Scholar). The observation that the anti-catabolic effects of CITED2 were not directly linked to the IL-1β signaling pathway was unexpected, because a previous study in mouse D10 T cells reported that CITED2 was inducible by IL-1α. Differential responses to IL-1 in T cells and chondrocytes may result from cell-type dependent signaling pathways. We used IL1-β (29Sun H.B. Zhu Y.X. Yin T. Sledge G. Yang Y.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13555-13560Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), because this is the dominant IL-1 isoform in human tissues and it plays a central role in the inflammation and connective tissue destruction observed in rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. The observed quick increase in MMP-1 expression in chondrocytes after 1 h of the IL-1β treatment is consistent with the responses to IL-1 in synoviocytes (30Sun H.B. Yokota H. Matrix Biol. 2002; 21: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). IL-1β suppresses the expression of the type II collagen gene in C-28/I2 chondrocytes (39Tan L. Peng H. Osaki M. Choy B.K. Auron P.E. Sandell L.J. Goldring M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17688-17700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). However, because CITED2 down-regulates and IL-1β up-regulates MMP expression in chondrocytes, CITED2 could be interfering with the actions of IL-1-induced transcription factors on MMP promoters. Consistent with our observation in C-28/I2 chondrocytes, Xu et al. (40Xu Z. Buckley M.J. Evans C.H. Agarwal S. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) reported that cyclic tensile strain, which generated an anti-inflammatory signal in chondrocytes, was not mediated through IL-1 receptors but instead was an antagonist of IL-1 actions (40Xu Z. Buckley M.J. Evans C.H. Agarwal S. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In conclusion, we have identified CITED2 as the critical repressor of MMP-1 and MMP-13 gene expression and associated proteolytic activities using flow shear as a probe. Further elucidation of CITED2-mediated mechanotransduction of chondrocytes would contribute to controlling catabolic responses in rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. We thank J. McAteer and E.

This may be via increased oxidative stress and/or mitochondrial dysfunction either on its own or through its interaction with endogenous or exogenous neurotoxic species. We have created genetically engineered dopaminergic PC12 cell lines with subtly increased levels of MAO-B mimicking those observed during normal aging. In our cells, increased MAO-B activity was found to result in increased H2O2 production. This was found to correlate with a decrease in mitochondrial complex I activity which may involve both direct oxidative damage to the complex itself as well as oxidative effects on the tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (KGDH) which provides substrate for the complex. Both complex I and KGDH activities have been reported to be decreased in the Parkinsonian brain. These in vitro events are reversible by catalase addition. Importantly, MAO-B elevation was found to abolish the spare KGDH threshold capacity, which can normally be significantly inhibited before it affects maximal mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates. Our data suggest that H2O2 production via subtle elevations in MAO-B levels can result in oxidative effects on KGDH that can compromise the ability of dopaminergic neurons to cope with increased energetic stress.

The observed 2–3-fold age-related increase in brain MAO-B levels results in increased oxidative stress that may act as a predisposing factor in the vulnerability of the brain to age-related neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD) (11Cohen G. J. Neural. Transm. 1990; 32: 229-238Google Scholar, 12Barbeau A. J. Am. Geriatr. Soc. 1973; 21: 145-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 13Cohen G. J. Neural.

Neuroscience. 1988; 25: 439-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar).Age-related increases in MAO-B levels are consistent with localization of MAO-B within glial cells (17Terry R.D. DeTeresa R. Hansen L.A. Ann. Neurol. 1987; 21: 530-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar) and with reports that glial cell numbers increase with age in the normal human brain (18Bignami A. Dahl D. Kennmann H. Ranson B.R. Neuroglia. Oxford University Press, New York1995: 843-858Google Scholar) as well as in neurodegenerative disease and following brain injury (19Fowler J.S. Volkow N.D. Wang G.J. Logan J. Pappas N. Shea C. MacGregor R. Neurobiol. Aging. 1997; 18: 431-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The increase in MAO-B is not merely due to increased glial cell numbers but also occurs as a per cell increase in its enzymatic levels (20Ekblom J. Jossan S.S. Bergstrom M. Oreland L. Walum E. Aquilonius S.M. Glia. 1993; 8: 122-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 21Halliwell B. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 1609-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (2629) Google Scholar). H2O2 produced as a consequence of substrate oxidation by MAO-B within glia has a high membrane permeability and can diffuse into nearby mid-brain dopaminergic neurons leading to the production of toxic reactive oxygen species (21Halliwell B. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 1609-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (2629) Google Scholar).The substantia nigra, the brain area affected in PD, contains high numbers of MAO-B-positive astrocytes which are themselves protected to some degree from resulting H2O2 by high levels of glutathione and glutathione peroxidase, which can reduce peroxides to water (22Kang Y. Oiao X. Jurma O. Knusel B. Andersen J.K. Neuroreport. 1997; 8: 2053-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 23Raps S.P. Lai J.C. Hertz L. Cooper A.J.

Nedergaard M. Preuss A. Gelbard A.S. Perumal A.S. Cooper A.J. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Neurons, which contain significantly lower levels of these protective components, are particularly vulnerable to this mild oxidizing agent (26Buckman T.D. Sutphin M.S. Mitrovic B. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 2046-2058Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 27Behl C. Davis J.B. Lesley R. Schubert D.

Hydrogen peroxide produced within substantia nigra glial cells by MAO-B may be either broken down to H2O by the glutathione system or diffuse into nearby vulnerable dopaminergic neurons where it may elicit toxic effects (11Cohen G. J. Neural. Transm. 1990; 32: 229-238Google Scholar, 13Cohen G. J. Neural. Transm. 1983; 19: 89-103Google Scholar).MAO-B-catalyzed increased free radical production may contribute to an observed age-related increase in the incidence of mitochondrial damage in the brain, particularly in the substantia nigra (29Soong N.W. Hinton D.R. Cortopassi G. Arnheim N. Nat. Genet. 1992; 2: 318-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Addition of the MAO substrate tyramine to brain mitochondria results in increased H2O2 and mitochondrial DNA damage, suggesting that H2O2 generated during MAO-catalyzed substrate oxidation may contribute to impairment of mitochondrial function (30Hauptmann N. Grimsby J. Shih J.C. Cadenas E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 335: 295-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Addition of tyramine to rat brain mitochondria also decreases pyruvate-mediated state 3 respiration by about 30% and uncoupled respiration by about 50%, which is reversible by MAO-specific inhibitors (31Cohen G. Kesler N. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 2310-2315Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Therefore, increased MAO activity and monoamine turnover may serve as a source of oxidative stress that can suppress mitochondrial respiration. The amount of H2O2 produced via addition of the MAO-specific substrate tyramine to rat brain mitochondria exceeds that generated by succinate-driven mitochondrial respiration by 48-fold, suggesting that H2O2 production via MAO is an important contributor to mitochondrial damage and dysfunction (32Giulivi C. Cadenas E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1366: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).Interestingly, complex I has been found to be one of the mitochondrial enzymes most affected by oxidative stress (33Lenaz G. Bovina C. Castelluccio C. Fato R. Formiggini G. Genova M.L. Marchetti M. Pich M.M. Pallotti F. Parenti Castelli G. Biagini G. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 174: 329-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Reductions in the activity of complex I are associated with PD (34Beal M.F. Ann. Neurol. 1992; 31: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar, 35Haas R.H. Nasirian F. Nakano K. Ward D. Pay M. Hill R. Shults C.W. Ann.

Neurol. 1998; 44: S72-S84Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar), and cybrids containing mitochondria from PD patients display reduced complex I activity (37Sheehan J.P. Swerdlow R.H. Parker W.D. Miller S.W. Davis R.E. Tuttle J.B. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1221-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Selective inhibitions of complex I via systemic administration of either 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) or rotenone show patterns of morphological damage similar to Parkinsonian brain (38Ricaurte G.A.

Panov A.V. Greenamyre J.T. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 1301-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (2885) Google Scholar). MAO-B is responsible for conversion of MPTP to its toxic form MPP+. MPP+ is selectively transported into dopaminergic neurons causing toxic effects via direct inhibition of mitochondrial complex I activity (40Calne D.B. Langston J.W. Lancet. 1983; 2: 1457-1459Abstract PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 41Langston J.W. Irwin I. Clin. Neuropharmacol. 1986; 9: 485-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Exogenous or endogenous toxins similar to MPTP or rotenone may act in concert with age-related elevations in brain MAO-B levels to elicit the disease.Addition of pathological levels of H2O2 to hamster brain synaptosomes has been found to result in depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential and impaired mitochondrial calcium sequestration (42Tretter L. Chinopoulos C. Adam-Vizi V. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 2529-2537Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 43Chinopoulos C. Adam-Vizi V. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 893: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). These effects appeared to be due to selective inhibition of certain mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes including α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (KGDH) by H2O2 resulting in reduced production of NADH as substrate for mitochondrial complex I (44Chinopoulos C. Adam-Vizi V. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 302-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This may have important implications for PD where H2O2 is generated in excess, and not only complex I but also KGDH activity has been reported to be impaired (45Mizuno Y. Suzuki K. Ohta S. J. Neurol. Sci. 1990; 96: 49-57Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 46Mizuno Y. Matuda S. Yoshino H. Mori H. Hattori N. Ikebe S. Ann. Neurol. 1994; 35: 204-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In addition, H2O2 generation may also have direct oxidative effects on the enzyme complex (47Jha N. Jurma O. Lalli G. Liu Y.

Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4227) Google Scholar). This model system has allowed us to explore the possible role of subtle elevations in MAO-B and subsequent oxidative stress on mitochondrial dysfunction as it related to PD and to understand some of the possible mechanisms involved.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—All chemicals were obtained from Sigma, unless otherwise noted.Creation of Doxycycline-inducible MAO-B PC12 Cell Lines—A neomycin-resistant (neoR), rtTA-expressing clonal PC12 cell line (47Jha N.

PC12 rtTA cells were maintained by growth at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 5% horse serum, 1% streptomycin-penicillin in the presence of 200 μg/ml G418; MAO-B-transfected rTta cells were selected by using 200 μg/ml hygromycin-B for 15 days (Fig. 1). MAO-B PC12 clones were neuronally differentiated by using 50 ng/ml NGF for 2 days, before addition of dox to induce MAO-B. Clones were characterized for the presence of transgenes via PCR, for inducible increase in MAO-B protein levels via Western blot analysis using an anti-MAO-B antibody (Serotec) and actin (Chemicon) as loading control, and MAO-B enzymatic activity using 14C-β-PEA as substrate (49Westlund K.N.

After dox induction (40 μg/ml for 8 h) followed by addition of various concentrations of MPTP (0, 5, 7, and 10 μm for 4 h), viable cells were measured using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT). Briefly, 20 μl of 50 mg/ml MTT was added to cells and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. Media were removed. The resulting dark blue formazan crystalline product was dissolved in Me2SO, and the absorbance was analyzed in a Spectramax plate reader (Molecular Devices) at 570 nm.Amplex Red Assay—Cells were plated at 5 × 103 per well. After being allowed to settle for 4–5 h, the cells were induced for 6 h with 40 μg/ml dox ± 10 μm deprenyl, 10 μm PEA, or both. Amplex Red reagent (Molecular Probes) was added in a reaction buffer containing peroxidase (50Zhou M. Panchuk-Voloshina N. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 253: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The resulting increase in fluorescence over time was measured at 563 nm excitation/587 nm emission in a Spectramax fluorometer (Molecular Devices).Mitochondrial Preparation—Mitochondria were prepared by homogenizing cells in mitochondrial medium containing 320 mm sucrose, 5 mm TES, and 1 mm EGTA, centrifuging the homogenate at 1,000 × g, and pelleting the mitochondria in the resulting supernatant at 10,000 × g. The mitochondria were resuspended in 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm TES, and 0.1% (w/v) fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, pH 7.2, for complex I, KGDH, and citrate synthase assays.Complex I Activity—Activity was assayed in homogenates from isolated mitochondria as rotenone-sensitive NADH dehydrogenase activity by measuring 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol reduction in mitochondrial extract following addition of 200 μm NADH, 200 μm decylubiquinone, 2 mm KCN, and 0.002% 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol in the presence and absence of 2 μm rotenone (51Trounce I.A.

Values for this and all subsequent assays were normalized per protein by using Bio-Rad reagent.KGDH Activity—KGDH activity was assayed as the rate of NAD+ reduction at 340 nm upon addition of 5.0 mm MgCl2, 40.0 μm rotenone, 2.5 mm α-ketoglutarate, 0.1 mm CoA, 0.2 mm thymine pyrophosphate, and 1.0 mm NAD to freeze-thawed mitochondria (52Nulton-Persson A.C.

Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 484-509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Oxygen Consumption—Mitochondrial respiration was assayed in digitonin-permeabilized cells (2 μg/ml) in a buffer containing 125 mm KCl, 2 mm KH2PO4, 1 mm MgCl2, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0 (53Murphy A.N. Bredesen D.E. Cortopassi G. Wang E. Fiskum G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9893-9898Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), at 37 °C by using a Clark-type oxygen electrode (Hansatech). Respiration was calculated as the rate of oxygen consumption by using either 5.0 mm α-ketoglutarate, 5.0 mm malate as substrates for KGDH or 5.0 mm glutamate, 5.0 mm malate as substrates for complex I in the presence or absence of selective inhibition with 0–100 nm arsenite (KGDH) or 2.0 μm rotenone (complex I), respectively. 5.0 mm ascorbate, 10 μmN,N,N,N-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (TMPD) were used to assay KCN-inhibitable (1 mm) cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV)-driven respiration. Carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (10 μm) was added as uncoupler to assess maximum respiration rates.Assessment of Susceptibility to Exogenous Oxidative Stress via H2O2 Treatment and Monitoring of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential and Cytoplasmic Free Calcium Levels—Changes in mitochondrial membrane potential over time were measured at single cell resolution in populations of dox-treated versus untreated cells equilibrated with 20 nm tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM) fluorescence at 485 nm excitation and >520 nm emission as reported previously (54Ward M.W. Rego A.C. Frenguelli B.G. Nicholls D.G. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7208-7219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) following addition of 500 μm H2O2versus untreated controls. Changes in cytoplasmic free calcium levels were concurrently measured as the function of the change of the fura2 fluorescence ratio (340/380 nm excitation and >520 nm emission) in the same cell population (54Ward M.W. Rego A.C. Frenguelli B.G. Nicholls D.G. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7208-7219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mean fluorescence for each parameter was obtained by examining 10 cells per field in an average of 3 fields per condition every minute over an 8-min period. Fluorescence measurements were performed on an Olympus confocal microscope utilizing the Merlin imaging system.Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as means ± S.D., and significance testing was performed using analysis of variance.RESULTSDox-inducible MAO-B Expression in Dopaminergic PC12 Cells—In order to generate stable dopaminergic PC12 cell lines with inducible MAO-B levels, a full-length cDNA for human MAO-B was subcloned into the pTet-On vector (Clontech) under the control of an inducible tetracycline-responsive promoter (48Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4227) Google Scholar). The construct was used to transfect rtTA-expressing PC12 cells, and among the stable transfectant clones obtained, we found two that expressed 2–3-fold increases in levels of MAO-B after induction by dox (PC12-MAO-B4 and -B5) (Fig. 1) akin to increases seen during normal aging. Because both the clones displayed similar increases in MAO-B activity, we chose clone PC12-MAO-B5 for all further analyses. MAO-B protein levels and enzymatic activity in cell homogenates from this line were dox-inducible as measured by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2A) and a radiometric MAO-B enzyme assay (Fig. 2, B and C). MAO-B activity in the desired range was achieved at dox concentrations of 40–60 μg/ml (Fig. 2B). This activity was inhibited by the MAO-B-specific inhibitor deprenyl at a concentration of 10 μm; other studies have used deprenyl in this same approximate range (55Szutowicz A. Tomaszewicz M. Orsulak P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17660-17664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 56Glover V. Elsworth J.D. Sandler M. J. Neural. Transm. (suppl.). 1980; 16: 163-172Google Scholar). Based on time course of induction, we observed that deprenyl-sensitive activity in the desired range occurred by 4–6 h post-dox addition (40 μg/ml) and remained stable for more than 24 h (Fig. 2C). Upon withdrawal of the drug (at 12 h), MAO-B activity remained elevated for up to 72 h (data not shown). Based on these studies, dox pretreatment at a concentration of 40 μg/ml for 12 h was used for all subsequent experiments unless otherwise noted.Fig. 2MAO-B protein and activity levels are inducible by dox addition.A, Western blot demonstrating a dox-dependent increase in MAO-B protein levels. Cells were treated with 0 (N), 20, 30, 40, or 60 μg/ml dox over a 12-h period, and cell homogenates were isolated for Western blot using an MAO-B-specific antibody; the Western blot shown is representative of two separate experiments. The blot was stripped and re-probed with anti-actin antibody as loading control. Densitometry was performed to quantitate relative MAO-B protein levels in the representative Western blot. B, dox concentration curve of dox-induced MAO-B activity. MAO-B activity was measured following addition of either 0, 20, 40, or 60 μg/ml dox for 12 h via a radiometric method using 14C-β-phenylethylamine as substrate in the absence (♦) or presence (▴) of 10 μm deprenyl and normalized for protein (49Westlund K.N. Denney R.M. Kochersperger L.M. Rose R.M. Abell C.W. Science. 1985; 230: 181-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). C, time course of induction of MAO-B enzyme activity. MAO-B activity was measured at various time points following addition of 40 μg/ml dox in the absence (♦) or presence (▴) of deprenyl. Data represent triplicate values from three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Increased MAO-B Levels Exacerbate MPTP-induced Cell Death—The Parkinsonian-inducing neurotoxin MPTP is converted to its active form, MPP+, via MAO-B. MPP+ is well established as a specific reversible inhibitor of mitochondrial complex I and results in dopaminergic cell death (57Burns R.S. Chiueh C.C. Markey S.P. Ebert M.H. Jacobowitz D.M.

As proof of the functionality of our model system, we exposed dox-treated cells expressing MAO-B to 0, 5, 7, or 10 μm MPTP and measured cell survival in comparison to untreated controls by using the MTT reduction assay (Fig. 3). MAO-B expression alone resulted in a small degree of cell death and exacerbated MPTP-induced cell death in a dose-dependent fashion.Fig. 3Effects of dox induction on MPTP-mediated cell death as measured by the MTT assay. MPTP (5, 7, and 10 μm) was added 8 h post-dox treatment (40 μg/ml) to cells, and cell death was analyzed 4 h later, n = 4 per condition from three separate experiments; values are expressed as means ± S.D. *, p < 0.01 in comparison to no dox; **, p < 0.01 in comparison to dox alone.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Subtle MAO-B Elevations Result in Increased H2O2 Levels— H2O2 production via MAO-B-mediated oxidative deamination of substrate has been postulated to be an influencing factor for age-related neurodegeneration in PD. We assessed production of H2O2 as a function of increased MAO-B expression in our cell system via resorufin fluorescence by the Amplex Red assay (50Zhou M. Panchuk-Voloshina N. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 253: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). PC12MAO-B cells were induced with 40 μg/ml dox before adding Amplex Red. The resulting fluorescence was recorded in a spectrofluorometer. H2O2-mediated fluorescence was induced by the addition of either dox or the presence of the MAO-B substrate PEA (Fig. 4). Either dox or PEA alone caused an increase in H2O2 production. Applied together, they appear to have a synergistic effect that was deprenyl-inhibitable.Fig. 4MAO-B elevation results in increased H2O2 levels. H2O2 levels were measured as relative fluorescence over time (30 min) via the Amplex Red assay in cells cultured for 6 h in the absence (•) or presence (○) of dox (40 μg/ml), PEA alone (▵), dox + PEA (×), or dox + PEA+ deprenyl (▴) and assayed for fluorescence following addition of Amplex Red assay reagents. Plot shown is representative of at least three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Subtle MAO-B Elevations Result in Decreased Complex I Activity via Increased H2O2 Production—H2O2 generated during MAO-catalyzed substrate oxidation has been implicated in oxidative impairment of mitochondrial function. Of particular interest is mitochondrial complex I as its activity appears to be selectively inhibited in PD. Complex I activity was measured as a function of rotenone-sensitive NADH dehydrogenase activity using mitochondrial extracts from uninduced versus dox-induced cells (Fig. 5). At this level of MAO-B elevation, complex I activity in the induced cells was inhibited by 40% in comparison to uninduced cells. This inhibition was abolished in deprenyl-treated dox-induced cells. Addition of PEA to the dox-induced cells exacerbated the loss in activity (to nearly 70% uninduced), whereas addition of deprenyl to cells treated with both dox and PEA returned their activity to nearly control levels. Co-incubation of dox-treated cells with the H2O2 scavenger catalase attenuated the dox-induced loss in complex I activity. Citrate synthase activity was used as a normalizing control"

When microbial products bind to pathogen recognition receptors, macrophages are activated and release a broad array of mediators, such as cytokines, that orchestrate the inflammatory responses of the host. Phosphatidic acid (PA) has been implicated as an important metabolite of phospholipid biosynthesis and in membrane remodeling and has been further suggested to be a crucial second messenger in various cellular signaling events. Here we show that PA is an essential regulator of inflammatory response. Deleterious effects of PA are associated with the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, and the production of nitric oxide, prostaglandin E2, which are predominantly released by macrophage Raw264.7 cells. Furthermore, the administration of PA to mice increased the serum cytokine level. Moreover, direct or lipopolysaccharide-induced PA accumulation by macrophages led to the Akt-dependent activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin-p70 S6 kinase 1, a process required for the induction of inflammatory mediators. These findings demonstrate the importance of the role of PA in systemic inflammatory responses, and provide a potential usefulness as specific targets for the development of therapies.

These findings demonstrate the importance of the role of PA in systemic inflammatory responses, and provide a potential usefulness as specific targets for the development of therapies. Mononuclear phagocytes represent a large family of cell types that includes macrophages, Kupffer cells, and microglia. Macrophages exert key functions during the innate immune response, which is vital for the recognition and elimination of invasive microbial pathogens (1Hoffmann J.A. Kafatos F.C. Janeway C.A. Ezekowitz R.A. Science. 1999; 284: 1313-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (2167) Google Scholar, 2Aderem A. Underhill D.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 593-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (2112) Google Scholar). However, under certain circumstances macrophages have deleterious effects. This is the case in septic shock, which is a severe systemic inflammatory response triggered by interaction between some bacterial components and macrophages and other host cells (3Parrillo J.E. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 328: 1471-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1507) Google Scholar). Many pathogenic mediators of sepsis have been described, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS). 1The abbreviations used are: LPS, lipopolysaccharide; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; IL, interleukin; PG, prostaglandin; PA, phosphatidic acid; PLD, phospholipase D; iNOS, inducible nitric-oxide synthase; S6K, S6 kinase; 4E-BP1, eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; Ab, antibody; COX, cyclooxygenase-2; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; RT, reverse transcription; EIA, enzyme immunoassay; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; TTBS, Tris-buffered saline plus Tween 20; HEK, human embryonic kidney. As the major outer membrane component of Gram-negative bacteria, LPS serves as a potent modulator of acute inflammation (4Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 19-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). The most important factors of this are believed to be TNF-α, and IL-1β, but other factors play significant roles, including IL-6, IL-8, macrophage migration inhibitory factor (5Bozza M. Satoskar A.R. Lin G. Lu B. Humbles A.A. Gerard C. David J.R. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar), and high mobility group 1 protein (6Andersson U. Wang H. Palmblad K.

LPS also triggers the activation of multiple intracellular signaling cascades, resulting in the release of immunoregulatory molecules such as nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin (PG) (7Szabo C. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 851: 422-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 8Uematsu S. Matsumoto M. Takeda K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 5811-5816Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). This process may lead not only to tissue damage, but also to hemodynamic changes, multiple organ failure, and ultimately death. Phosphatidic acid (PA) participates and regulates numerous cellular pathways, including ligand-mediated secretion, endocytosis, and respiratory burst (9Choi W.S. Chahdi A. Kim Y.M. Fraundorfer P.F.

Phospholipase D (PLD), an important effector enzyme in receptor-mediated signaling pathways, catalyzes the hydrolysis of the most abundant membrane phospholipid, phosphatidylcholine, and generates PA and choline. PLD was first identified in plants but has subsequently been shown to be highly conserved across all species and to be present in large amounts in bacteria, yeast, and mammalian cells (12Exton J.H. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 303-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 13Morris A.J. Engebrecht J. Frohman M.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1996; 17: 182-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). A role for PA as a key intracellular signaling molecule has been proposed, as PA has been shown to directly activate protein kinases (14Rizzo M.A. Shome K. Vasudevan C. Stolz D.B. Sung T.C.

Cell Biochem. 1996; 60: 529-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Extensive attention has been recently given to the diverse biological effects of PA released by activated macrophages and multiple other cells (18Kusner D.J. Hall C.F. Jackson S. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2266-2274PubMed Google Scholar, 19Bandyopadhyay R. Basu M.K. Mol. Cell Biochem. 2000; 203: 127-133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Of particular interest, PA acts as an intermediary messenger with various selective pro-inflammatory targets. PA has been suggested to protect by pharmacologic inhibition in LPS-induced septic mice (20Rice G.C. Brown P.A. Nelson R.J. Bianco J.A. Singer J.W. Bursten S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3857-3861Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Zhang et al. (21Zhang F. Zhao G. Dong Z. Int. Immunopharmacol. 2001; 1: 1375-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) found that the stimulation of LPS leading to PLD activation results in inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) induction. However, in these studies, the action mechanism of the PLD activated by LPS was not defined, and the relationship of the activation of PLD to the various signaling enzyme cascades following LPS stimulation was unknown. Although the regulation of PA generation represents a multi-potent strategy for modulating the occasionally self-destructive forces unleashed by exuberant self-defensive responses, the intracellular signaling mechanisms triggered by PA in cells have not been fully elucidated. The regulation of translation initiation is the main control point of mRNA translation. Several steps in translation are regulated by signaling events coupled to the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a Ser/Thr protein kinase that is specifically inhibited by the immunosuppressant rapamycin (22Gingras A.C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 807-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar). Its best known downstream effectors include the ribosomal subunit S6 kinase (S6K) and the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein (4E-BP1) (23Gingras A.C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 913-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1766) Google Scholar). Both the activation of S6K and the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 are stimulated by mitogens, and mTOR is required to trigger this mitogen response (24Brown E.J. Beal P.A. Keith C.T. Chen J. Shin T.B. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1995; 377: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). In addition, mitogenic activation of S6K and 4E-BP1 requires the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway (25Sekulic A. Hudson C.C. Homme J.L. Yin P. Otterness D.M. Karnitz L.M. Abraham R.T. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3504-3513PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, Fang et al. (26Fang Y. Vilella-Bach M. Bachmann R. Flanigan A. Chen J. Science. 2001; 294: 1942-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar) reported that PA (likely to be produced by PLD) directly mediates the mitogenic stimulation of mTOR signaling to S6K1. However, a major unanswered question is how PA is sensed by cells and how such signals are transduced through mTOR to downstream effectors. We hypothesized that the PA is involved in macrophage activation leading to production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, NO, and PGE2. To examine this possibility, we used Raw264.7 cells to test the production of these cytokines, NO, and PGE2 in the presence of synthetic PA or LPS. The addition of synthetic PA to macrophages led to an increase in pro-inflammatory mediators through the Akt and the mTOR-p70 S6K1 pathways. We also analyzed PLD activity in LPS-treated macrophages and investigated whether produced PA can modulate pro-inflammatory mediators. We found that LPS-stimulated PA clearly induced pro-inflammatory mediators, an effect that was mediated by the Akt-mTOR pathway. These findings support the hypothesis that PLD generating PA is an important factor in the production of macrophage systemic inflammatory mediators. Reagents and Antibodies—LPS (Escherichia coli serotype 0111:B4), dioctanoyl PA (99%), 1-butanol, and 1-propranolol were obtained from Sigma; LY294002 was from BIOMOL (Plymouth Meeting, PA); and rapamycin was obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). For Western blot analysis, we used a rabbit Ab against iNOS (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2; Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor, MI), phospho-Akt (Thr-308), Akt, phospho-mTOR (Ser-2448), phospho-p70 S6K1 (Thr-389), and p70 S6K1 (Cell Signaling Technology). Peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, anti-goat IgG, or anti-mouse IgG were used as secondary antibodies. Cell Culture—Raw264.7 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 10 units/ml penicillin, and 10 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in a water-saturated atmosphere. The cells were treated with LPS or synthetic PA for the indicated times. Determination of NO and PGE2 Production—NO production was estimated by measuring nitrate/nitrite in the cell culture media. Macrophages were cultured in RPMI, and samples were stored at –80 °C until assayed. Reduced samples were incubated with an equal volume of Griess reagent, and absorbance was measured at 550 nm. Total nitrate/nitrite concentration was determined versus a standard curve. PGE2 production was measured using a commercial PGE2 enzyme immunoassay (EIA) kit (Amersham Biosciences). Cells were cultured in 6-well or 12-well plates and stimulated with PA or LPS. Supernatant samples were obtained at the indicated times and subjected to EIA analysis. Cytokine Measurements—The concentrations of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 were determined by cytokine-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, according to the instructions from the manufacturer (R&D Systems). Analysis of Blood Cytokines in PA-stimulated Mice—Female C57BL/6 mice (8–10 weeks, 19–22 g) were randomly grouped (5–7 mice/group) and injected intraperitoneally with PA over different periods of time, in a blind fashion. Blood was collected, and serum TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 levels were determined. Akt, mTOR, and p70 S6K1 Activation—Cells were treated with PA or LPS as described above. Cells were then lysed with lysis solution, and Western blots were performed as described above; membranes so obtained were probed with Ab against active (phosphorylated) Akt, mTOR, or p70 S6K1. Blots were stripped and reproved with Ab recognizing both active and total Akt, mTOR, or p70 S6K1, to demonstrate equal loading. PLD Activity Assay—For the PA production analysis, cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate (5 μCi/ml) in DMEM phosphate-free medium containing 1% fetal bovine serum for 24 h. The radioactive medium was replaced with DMEM, and challenged with LPS in DMEM containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin for specific times. Incubations were terminated by the addition of 1 ml of methanol:HCl (100:1), and lipids were extracted. PA was identified by the co-spotting of standards and quantified after separating total radioactive lipids by TLC using ethyl acetate, 2,2,4-trimethyl pentane, glacial acetic acid, and water (65:10:15:50) as the developing solvent system. Transfection and Promoter Activity Assay—Cells were transfected with full-length iNOS or COX-2 promoter DNA using LipofectAMINE 2000. After transfection, cells were incubated in complete media for 24 h at 37 °C before being stimulated with PA or LPS for 12 h at 37 °C. In some experiments, cells were preincubated with 1-butanol or 1-propranolol for 10 min at 37 °C before adding LPS. Cell lysates were assayed for luciferase activity according to the instructions from the manufacturer (Promega) using a luminometer. Total RNA Isolation and RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from PA-stimulated Raw264.7 cells using Tri reagent according to the instructions from the manufacturer and was then reverse transcribed using a GeneAmp RNA PCR core kit (Applied Biosystems). The PCR was performed using an annealing temperature of 55 °C with the following primers: TNF-α forward (5′-TTC TGT CTA CTG AAC TTC GGG GTG ATC GGT CC-3′) and reverse (5′-GTA TGA GAT AGC AAA TCG GCT GAC GGT GTG GG-3′, which generates a product of 354 bp), IL-1β forward (5′-GAA GCT GTG GCA GCT ACC TAT GTC T-3′) and reverse (5′-CTC TGC TTG TGA GGT GCT GAT GTA C-3′, which generates a product of 523 bp), IL-6 forward (5′-TTC CCT ACT TCA CAA GTC-3′) and reverse (5′-ACT AGG TTT GCC GAG TAG-3′, which generates a product of 564 bp), and the housekeeping gene β-actin forward (5′-TCC TTC GTT GCC GGT CCA CA-3′) and reverse (5′-CGT CTC CGG AGT CCA TCA CA-3′, which generates a product of 509 bp). Protein Extraction and Western Blot Analysis—Cells were washed twice in cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed on ice with lysis solution (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, and protease inhibitor mixture). Sample protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Proteins from the cell lysates (30 μg) were boiled at 95 °C in Laemmli SDS loading buffer, separated on 8% SDS-PAGE, and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked for at least 30 min at room temperature in Tris-buffered saline plus 0.05% Tween-20 (TTBS) containing 5% nonfat dry milk and then incubated with TTBS containing the primary Ab. For immunoblotting, incubation was performed for 4 h at room temperature. After five washes of 30 min each in TTBS, the membranes were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated secondary Ab for 1 h. After five washes of 30 min with TTBS, enhanced chemiluminescence detection (Amersham Biosciences) was performed and the membranes were exposed to x-ray films. PA Induces the Production of Pro-inflammatory Cytokines in Macrophages—Exogenous PA added to cell culture medium incorporates rapidly into cellular membranes and subsequently participates in cellular functions (27Fukami K. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10988-10993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Reeves H.L. Thompson M.G. Dack C.L. Burt A.D. Day C.P. Hepatology. 2000; 31: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). TNF-α is one of the earliest cytokines released by activated macrophages, and occupies a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of inflammation, endotoxic shock, and tissue injury. We measured TNF-α in supernatants conditioned by Raw264.7 macrophages exposed to PA for 2 h, and observed a PA dose-dependent stimulation of TNF-α (Fig. 1A). PA concentrations as low as 10 μm significantly increased TNF-α release. To address the molecular basis of PA-induced macrophage activation, we measured TNF-α mRNA levels in PA-stimulated cells. RT-PCR results demonstrated that stimulation with PA significantly induced TNF-α mRNA production in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). Up-regulation of TNF-α mRNA was observed within 2 h of PA addition, and decreased the levels of TNF-α mRNA. To assess the specificity of cytokine response to PA, we measured the release of other macrophage-derived cytokines in PA-stimulated macrophage cell cultures. PA time-dependently induced the release of other pro-inflammatory cytokines, i.e. IL-1β and IL-6 mRNA and protein (Fig. 1, B and C), but failed to induce the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-2, transforming growth factor-β, and interferon-γ; data not shown). The kinetic profiles of IL-1β and IL-6 differed significantly from that observed in the TNF-α, in which peak IL-1β and IL-6 mRNA levels occurred within 4 and 6 h, respectively (Fig. 1B). This activation was PA-specific, because none of the other phospholipids tested were found to stimulate these cytokines, including lysophosphatidic acid and diacylglycerol (Fig. 1D). To exclude contamination of endotoxin effect, the endotoxin content was determined by using a kinetic quantitative chromogenic Limulus amoebocyte lysate kit (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) and showed no contamination of endotoxins (<0.001 ng/ml). Administration of PA to Mice Stimulates Increased Serum Cytokines—To determine whether PA can stimulate cytokines synthesis in vivo, we administered PA to C57BL/6 mice and measured serum cytokines by ELISA. Cytokines levels in animals injected intraperitoneally with PA were monitored and compared with those of animals that had received control injections of saline. The administration of doses of PA (0.5–2 mg) to mice significantly stimulated the appearance of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 in serum, indicating that the systemic exposure to PA activates systemic pro-inflammatory cytokines in vivo (Fig. 2A). The kinetic pattern of PA-activated cytokines synthesis differed from that of LPS-induced mice. The administration of LPS to mice activated TNF-α synthesis within 1 h, and this then rapidly declined to basal levels as judged by ELISA (data not shown). In contrast to LPS, PA administration showed TNF-α synthesis within 2 h and this slowly reduced over at least 30 h (Fig. 2B). Lethality was monitored over time (10 days) and compared with animals that had received control injections of saline or LPS. 100% of the mice treated with PA survived as compared with 0% of the LPS-treated mice. PA Induces iNOS and COX-2 Expression—Cytokines, such as TNF-α and IL-1β, are major activator of macrophages, a cell type in which iNOS and COX-2 have been reported to be highly up-regulated upon exposure to several pro-inflammatory signals. We characterized the effect of PA on iNOS and COX-2 expression and on their products. To analyze the effect of PA on NO and PGE2 production, we treated PA to cells and assayed nitrites and PGE2 using Griess reagent and an EIA kit, respectively. Nitrites were detected within 10 h of incubation with PA and dramatically increased after 12 h. In contrast to nitrite production, PGE2 was detected within 2 h of incubation with PA, peaked at 8 h, and slowly increased after 24 h (Fig. 3A). Treatment of macrophages with different doses of PA showed a dramatic increase in proteins and their products, although detectable levels of both proteins and their products were observed after treatment with as little as 10 or 50 μm PA (Fig. 3B). Next, we investigated the mechanism by which PA induces both of these proteins, by transiently transfecting the cells with iNOS and COX-2 promoter luciferase reporter. PA was found to induce iNOS and COX-2 promoter activities in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3C). Taken together, these results indicate that iNOS and COX-2 protein synthesis are up-regulated by PA in mouse macrophages. PA Induction of Pro-inflammatory Mediators Requires the Akt Pathway—We observed that extracellular PA stimulated three cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) and iNOS and COX-2 protein expressions in Raw264.7 cells. The understanding of the PA-initiated intracellular pathways leading those responses is important. Akt could participate in these signaling reactions, as it is a well known mediator, and was recently shown to be activated in macrophages (29Park D.W. Kim J.R. Kim S.Y. Sonn J.K. Bang O.S. Kang S.S. Kim J.H. Baek S.H. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 2093-2099Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To determine whether Akt is involved in the PA-stimulated production of three cytokines and two proteins, we examined the activation of Akt by detecting their phosphorylated forms by Western blotting using specific anti-phospho-Akt Ab. PA strongly stimulated a rapid (within 10 min) increase in Akt phosphorylation, which peaked at 20 min, and then declined to base-line level (Fig. 4A). To confirm the involvement of the Akt pathway, we analyzed the phosphorylation of Akt in cells treated by LY294002, an inhibitor of PI3K/Akt. Fig. 4B illustrates the observed inhibition of the phosphorylation of Akt by LY294002. To determine whether the Akt pathway is required for the PA induction of cytokines and the two proteins in Raw264.7 cells, we examined the effect of LY294002 on PA-induced mediator production and expression. LY294002 strongly inhibited the PA induction of all cytokines. In addition, LY294002 inhibited the PA induction of nitrites and PGE2 production, and iNOS and COX-2 expression (Fig. 4, C and D). These results indicate that the Akt pathway mediates the PA induction of cytokine production, and of iNOS and COX-2 expression. Rapamycin Specifically Abrogates the PA-mediated Production of Cytokines and the Expressions of iNOS and COX-2— Rapamycin, a specific mTOR inhibitor, was used to examine the role of mTOR signaling in the PA-induced production of inflammatory mediators. We examined whether the mTOR-S6K pathway is activated by PA in macrophages. PA strongly induced the phosphorylation of p70 S6K1 at Thr-389 from 20 min and this was sustained for at least 4 h. In addition, PA stimulated the phosphorylation of mTOR at Ser-2448 (Fig. 5A). As expected, rapamycin did not affect Akt phosphorylation (data not shown), but it completely inhibited p70 S6K1 phosphorylation (Fig. 5B). We then examined whether the mTOR-p70 S6K1 pathway is activated by PA through Akt. In contrast to rapamycin, LY294002 completely inhibited Akt and p70 S6K1 phosphorylation by PA (Fig. 5C). To confirm the sequential activation of PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway, cells pretreated with the LY294002 before PA stimulation and evaluated the mTOR activation. PA-stimulated mTOR phosphorylation was significantly inhibited by LY294002 (Fig. 5D). Thus, it is clear that PA activates a rapamycin-sensitive Akt-mTOR-p70 S6K1 signaling pathway in macrophages. To confirm that mTOR-p70 S6K1 is recruited by PA to produce cytokines and the expressions of iNOS and COX-2, we determined the cytokine levels and iNOS and COX-2 expression by PA in the presence or absence of rapamycin. Rapamycin caused a dose-dependent abrogation of PA-induced cytokines, nitrites, and PGE2 production and of iNOS and COX-2 expression (Fig. 6, A and B). Thus, the PA-induced production of pro-inflammatory mediators in macrophages occurs through an Akt-sensitive mTOR-p70 S6K1 pathway.Fig. 6Involvement of mTOR and p70 S6K1 in the PA-induced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and mediators. Cells were treated with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin (Rapa; 30 min) before stimulation with 100 μm PA for 18 h. A, the concentrations of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 in the culture media were determined by ELISA. B, nitrites and PGE2 secreted into the medium were quantified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Western blot analyses of iNOS and COX-2 were performed using anti-iNOS or anti-COX-2 antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The PLD Activity Is Required for LPS-induced Pro-inflammatory Mediators—To determine whether PLD is involved in the LPS-induced production of pro-inflammatory mediators, we investigated the expression of PLDs in Raw264.7 cells, and found that expression of PLD2 is enriched in these cells (Fig. 7A). We tested the response of these cells to LPS by monitoring the production of PA. Stimulation of these cells with LPS led to an acute increase in the amount of cellular PA within 5 min, which returned to its basal level after 30 min (Fig. 7B). PLD2 is predominantly expressed in the Raw264.7 cells. Therefore, effects of PLD2 on iNOS and COX-2 promoter activities were examined with HEK293 cells stably transfected with empty vector or human PLD2. iNOS and COX-2 promoter activities were significantly enhanced in PLD2-transfected cells compared with vector-transfected cells (Fig. 7C). 1-Butanol, but not 2-butanol (data not shown), significantly blocked the LPS-stimulated release of cytokines, whereas propranolol potentiated this LPS stimulatory effect (Fig. 8A), thus confirming the specificity of involvement of PA in the PLD-mediated pathway. Furthermore, the levels of iNOS and COX-2 proteins and of luciferase reporter activity achieved by LPS stimulation were significantly inhibited by 1-butanol and were conversely increased by propranolol (Fig. 8, B and C). Thus, PA production through PLD appears to be required for the LPS stimulation of pro-inflammatory mediators.Fig. 8Effect of 1-butanol and 1-propranolol on the LPS-induced production of pro-inflammatory mediators. Raw264.7 cells were grown in 6-well plates and treated with the indicated concentrations of LPS in the presence of 0.5% 1-butanol (▪) or 100 μm 1-propranolol (□). A, the concentration of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 in the culture media was determined by ELISA. B, secreted nitrites and PGE2 were quantified using Griess reagent and EIA as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Western blot analyses of iNOS or COX-2 were performed using anti-iNOS or anti-COX-2 antibodies. Results are the means ± S.D. of triplicate measurements and are representative of the results of three separate experiments. Con, control; 1-BuOH, 1-butanol; Propra, 1-propranolol. C, Raw264.7 cells were grown in 6-well plates and transiently transfected with an iNOS or a COX-2 promoter-driven luciferase reporter plasmid. 24 h after transfection, cells were incubated for 12 h with the indicated concentrations of LPS in the presence of 1-butanol (▪) or 1-propranolol (□). Luciferase activity was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures” and normalized with respect to total protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The rapid stimulation of PLD in LPS-treated macrophages is consistent with the idea that this phospholipase mediates the activation of Akt-mTOR-p70 S6K1. To test this hypothesis directly, p70 S6K1 phosphorylation was measured in Raw264.7 cells that had been treated with LY294002 or rapamycin before LPS exposure. Both compounds were found to substantially inhibit LPS-stimulated p70 S6K1 phosphorylation (Fig. 9A). We then examined whether LY294002 or rapamycin affected pro-inflammatory mediator production in LPS-treated raw264.7 cells, and found that both inhibitors partially inhibited mediators production stimulated by LPS (Fig. 9B). These functions of LPS were also mediated, in part, by the sequential activation of the Akt-mTOR-p70 S6K1 pathway. These results demonstr"

In this study, we found that two gene products (Plh1p and Dga1p) are responsible for the terminal step of TAG synthesis in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe through two different mechanisms: Plh1p is a phospholipid diacylglycerol acyltransferase, whereas Dga1p is an acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase. Cells with both dga1+ and plh1+ deleted (DKO cells) lost viability upon entry into the stationary phase and demonstrated prominent apoptotic markers. Exponentially growing DKO cells also underwent dramatic apoptosis when briefly treated with diacylglycerols (DAGs) or free fatty acids. We provide strong evidence suggesting that DAG, not sphingolipids, mediates fatty acids-induced lipoapoptosis in yeast.

In mammals, TAG synthesis plays essential roles in a number of physiological processes, including intestinal fat absorption, energy storage in muscle and adipose tissue, and lactation. It also contributes to pathological conditions such as obesity and hypertriglyceridemia (1Farese Jr., R.V. Cases S. Smith S.J. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2000; 11: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). TAG synthesis through both the glycerol-3-phosphate pathway and the monoacylglycerol pathway is acyl-CoA-dependent. The transfer of an acyl group from acyl-CoA to diacylglycerols (DAGs) catalyzed by the enzyme diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) is regarded as the only committed reaction in TAG synthesis in the glycerolipid pathway, because DAG is diverted from membrane glycerolipid biosynthesis (2Bell R.M. Coleman R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 459-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Two distinct mammalian DGAT genes have been identified recently.

In addition, acyl-CoA-independent TAG synthesis was also shown to exist in eukaryotes.

Dga1p is highly homologous to mammalian DGAT2, whereas Lro1p encodes a protein with significant sequence similarity to the mammalian enzyme lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase. Dga1p utilizes acyl-CoA to esterify DAG, whereas Lro1p transfers an acyl group from a phospholipid molecule to the sn-3 position of DAG. Dga1p and Lro1p mediate the bulk of TAG synthesis; however, in their absence, 2–4% of normal TAG synthesis could still be detected. It was later determined that Are1p and Are2p, two acyl-CoA sterol acyltransferases in yeast, are responsible for this residual activity. When all four genes are deleted simultaneously, synthesis of both sterol esters and TAG is completely blocked. However, no obvious growth defects were detected in the budding yeast cells completely free of either TAG or neutral lipids. This is rather surprising, because neutral lipids have long been regarded as a safe depot for polar and potentially toxic lipids such as fatty acids, DAG, or sterols. A recent study has proven that synthesis of TAG prevents fatty acids-induced lipotoxicity in mammalian cells (12Listenberger L.L. Han X. Lewis S.E. Cases S. Farese Jr., R.V. Ory D.S. Schaffer J.E.

Although the fission and budding yeasts are as divergent from each other as each from the mammals, S. pombe has been shown to have greater similarity to mammals at least in certain steps of cell division and in aspects of stress signaling (15Toone W.M. Jones N. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 485-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The enzymes and pathways of lipid metabolism, their physiological significance, and their resemblance to mammalian systems are largely unexplored in S. pombe. In this work, we describe the identification of two genes, plh1+ and dga1+, that encode enzymes that are responsible for the bulk of TAG synthesis in the fission yeast. We provide convincing evidence that fission yeast cells defective in TAG synthesis undergo apoptosis upon entry into the stationary phase. The important role of DAG in the induction of lipoapoptosis is also investigated.

Transformed cells were suspended in 200 μl of 1.2 m sorbitol and selected on EMM plates with appropriate amino acid supplements. Clones bearing the individual or double gene deletions were identified by diagnostic PCR with primers in the coding region of ura4+ or his3+ (GAGAAAGAATGCTGAGTAG for ura4+ and GAGTCTTTAATTCATTAC for his3+), and primers in the region outside of the flanking fragment of dga1+ or plh1+ (CGATAGTAGTCAATACCAG and GTATATTAGTATTGCCTAAT accordingly). The DKO strain was constructed by consecutive deletions of plh1+ and dga1+ in MBY266. The TKO strain was generated by deletion of pca1+ from the DKO strain.

Cell Viability Assay—For cell viability at different growth phases, cells were grown to various densities in YES (determined by A595). The number of viable cells was obtained after cells were diluted properly in distilled water and plated in triplicates on YES agar. Colonies were scored after 3 days of incubation at 30 °C. For cell viability after various treatments, cells were grown to early log phase (A595 = 0.1) before lipids or other chemicals were added. After treatment, cells were collected and viability was analyzed as described above. DAG, Fatty Acids, and Ceramide Treatment—For fatty acids treatment, palmitic acid and oleic acid were dissolved in chloroform as 500 mm stock. Each microliter of fatty acids was dissolved in 12.5 μl of tyloxapol:enthanol (1:1) and added into growth medium. Wild type and DKO strains were grown to early log phase and then incubated in medium containing different concentrations (0.5, 0.8, and 1 mm) of palmitic acid or oleic acid for 0–3 h. Control groups were cultured in the medium added with the same volume of tyloxapol:enthanol without fatty acids. After incubation, cells were analyzed for viability and DNA fragmentation. DiC8 DAG and ceramide were dissolved in Me2SO. The working concentrations for DAG were 0.1, 0.2, or 0.3 mm, whereas for ceramide they were 10 or 20 μm (23Kearns B.G. McGee T.P. Mayinger P.

Nile Red Staining—Cells were grown to early stationary phase, washed with deionized H2O two times, and incubated with 1 μg/ml Nile Red (1 mg/ml in acetone stock). Fluorescence images were obtained with a Leica DMLB microscope (25Yang H. Bard M. Bruner D.A. Gleeson A. Deckelbaum R.J. Aljinovic G. Pohl T.M. Rothstein R. Sturley S.L. Science. 1996; 272: 1353-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Detection of Apoptotic Markers—All assays that follow were performed as previously described (26Madeo F. Frohlich E. Ligr M. Grey M. Sigrist S. Wolf D.H. Frohlich K.U. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 757-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). For 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining, cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min, washed once with PBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and twice with PBS, and then stained with DAPI. Cells were viewed using a Leica DMLB microscope. For terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL), cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 1 h, digested with zymolase, washed with PBS, incubated in a permeabilization solution (0.1% Triton in 0.1% sodium citrate) for 2 min on ice, washed twice with PBS, and incubated with 50-μl TUNEL mixtures for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed with PBS twice and then viewed using a Leica DMLB microscope. For annexin V staining, cells were washed in sorbitol buffer (1.2 m sorbitol, 0.5 mm MgCl2, potassium phosphate, pH 6.8), digested with zymolase for 2 h at room temperature, harvested, washed in binding buffer (10 mm HEPES/NaOH, 140 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.2 m sorbitol), pelleted, and resuspended in binding buffer. 2 μl of annexin-FITC and 2 μl of propidium iodide were added to a 38-μl cell suspension and then incubated for 20 minutes at room temperature. The cells were harvested, suspended in binding buffer, and applied to microscopic slides. Production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was detected by dihydroethidium (Sigma), which was used at 5 μg/ml cell culture. After incubation for 10 min, cells were viewed under a Leica DMLB microscope through a Texas Red filter. The free radical spin trap reagent 3,3,5,5,-tetramethylpyrroline N-oxide (TMPO) was used at 125 μg/ml cell culture. Cells were pretreated with TMPO for 2 h before lipids were added. In Vivo Assay of Oleate Incorporation—The incorporation of [3H]oleate into TAG was used as a measurement of DAG esterification essentially as described previously (9Oelkers P. Tinkelenberg A. Erdeniz N. Cromley D. Billheimer J.T. Sturley S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15609-15612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Briefly, Cells were cultured in YES or EMM without appropriate nutrients for plasmid maintenance when necessary. Approximately 5 ml of cells at logarithmic (log) phase (A595 = 0.55–0.80) were pulsed with 5 μCi of [3H]oleate at 30 °C for 30 min with shaking. Cells were washed twice with 0.5% Nonidet P-40, once with dH2O, and lyophilized. The dried cell pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of lyticase stock solution (1700 units/ml in 10% glycerol, 0.02% sodium azide) and incubated at -70 °C for 1 h and at 30 °C for 15 min. Lipids were extracted by hexane and analyzed by TLC. The plates were developed in hexane:diethyl ether:acetic acid (70:30:1) and stained with iodine vapor. Incorporation of label into lipids was determined after scintillation counting and normalization to a [14C]cholesterol internal standard and cell dry weight. For each assay, at least three independent strains of each genotype were used. Statistical analysis was performed using a paired t test. Analysis of DAG Accumulation by Steady-state Labeling—Cells were grown for 18–25 h to mid-log phase or early stationary phase in media containing 1 μCi/ml [3H]oleate (9Oelkers P. Tinkelenberg A. Erdeniz N. Cromley D. Billheimer J.T. Sturley S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15609-15612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested, and lipids were extracted, separated, visualized, and quantified as described above. Isolation of Microsomes—Microsomes were isolated as described (27Zinser E. Daum G. Yeast. 1995; 11: 493-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Briefly, wild type and mutant strains were cultivated overnight in 1 liter of YES medium at 30 °C to log phase. Cells were collected through centrifugation. The pellets were washed with dH2O, resuspended, and incubated at 0.5 g wet wt/ml in 0.1 m Tris SO4 (with 10 mm dithiothreitol) at room temperature for 10 min. Cells were harvested, washed once with 1.2 m sorbitol, and resuspended at 0.15 g wet wt/ml in 1.2 m sorbitol (with 20 mm K3PO4 and 0.5 mg/ml lyticase), pH 7.2. Spheroplasts were formed after a 90-min incubation at 30 °C. Cells were washed twice with 1.2 m sorbitol, resuspended, and disrupted with 20 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer using a tight fitting pestle at 4 °C. Homogenates were spun at 20,000 × g for 30 min. The pellets were discarded. The supernatants were collected and spun at 100,000 × g for 45 min. The final pellets containing microsomes were resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). Protein concentrations were determined by using a Bradford assay kit from Bio-Rad. In Vitro (Microsomal) Assay of DAG Esterification—Enzyme activity was determined by the incorporation of [1-14C]oleoyl-CoA, 1-stearoyl-2-[14C]arachidonyl-sn-glycerol or l-3-phosphatidylethanolamines, 1-palmitoyl-2-[1-14C]linoleoyl into TAG. Each standard assay was performed in triplicate in 150 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, and the final volume was 200 μl, containing 80 μg of microsomal proteins, 15 μm bovine serum albumin, 150 μm DAG, 8 mm MgCl2,150 μm phosphatidylserine (PS)/phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs) liposomes (1:1 molar ratio), and 50 μm oleoyl-CoA. All the assays were conducted at room temperature for 25 min. For PDAT assay, oleoyl-CoA was omitted while [14C]phosphatidylethanolamines were added in liposomes at different concentration (0, 15, 30, 45, and 60 μm). For DGAT assay, [14C]oleoyl-CoA was added at different concentrations (0, 5, 20, 25, and 50 μm). In the diacylglycerol transacylase assay, [14C]DAG was added at 0, 7.5, 15, 35, and 70 μm, whereas MgCl2 and bovine serum albumin were omitted. In control assays, all components were the same except microsomes were removed. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 6 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1). Phase separation was induced by the addition of 1.2 ml of water. 1 μl of [3H]cholesterol and 15 μg of triolein were added as an internal standard and carrier, respectively. The lipid-containing phase was dried with nitrogen, and the lipids were dissolved in 100 μl of chloroform for spotting on TLC plates. The plates were developed in hexane:diethyl ether:acetic acid (70:30:1), and TAG was quantified by scintillation counting Diacylglycerol Kinase Assay—The assay was conducted as described in the Biotrak assay reagents system (Amersham Biosciences). Wild type and DKO yeast cells were grown in YES medium to mid-log phase and then treated with medium containing 0.8 mm palmitate or oleate. Cells were collected at different time points (0, 30, 60, and 120 min). DAG was extracted with other lipids and quantified through a phosphorylation reaction catalyzed by a bacterial DAG kinase. Identification of plh1+and dga1+in S. pombe—We searched the fission yeast genome data base for homologous sequences to human DGAT1 (hDGAT1), human DGAT2 (hDGAT2), and the budding yeast LRO1 using tBLASTX. A sequence with significant homology to hDGAT2 (40% identity at protein level) was identified and named dga1+ (GeneDB systematic name: SPCC1235.15). In addition, as previously reported, an open reading frame highly homologous (45% identity at protein level) to the budding yeast LRO1 was found in the fission yeast genome and named plh1+ (for Pombe LRO1 Homolog 1, GeneDB systematic name: SPBC776.14) in this study. A few open reading frames showing limited homology to DGAT1 were also found, but they are unlikely to play a role in TAG synthesis as suggested by a previous report (9Oelkers P. Tinkelenberg A. Erdeniz N. Cromley D. Billheimer J.T. Sturley S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15609-15612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). plh1+ predicts a protein of 623 amino acids, with a putative transmembrane domain near its N terminus. Plh1p also has a conserved serine lipase motif HS(M/L)G between amino acids 292 and 296. dga1+ encodes a 349-residue protein with at least one transmembrane domain. The region of the putative glycerol phospholipid domain in hDGAT2 was also found to be conserved in Dga1p (45% identity over 80 amino acids). Deletion of plh1+and dga1+Resulted in a Viable Yeast Cell without Detectable TAG—To determine whether Plh1p and Dga1p are involved in TAG synthesis in the fission yeast, we generated Δplh1, Δdga1 single and Δplh1Δdga1 double deletion (referred to as the DKO strain thereafter) mutants by homologous recombination. All mutants were viable at 16 °C, 30 °C, and 37 °C on rich or minimal media and on different carbon sources (data not shown). We were also unable to observe any obvious morphological changes in the DKO cells under light microscope. To investigate whether cellular TAG mass was affected in these strains, cells were grown to mid-log phase, and lipids were extracted, separated by TLC, and stained by iodine vapor. Although the TAG mass in each single deletion mutant was visually indistinguishable from that of the wild type cells, virtually no TAG mass could be seen for DKO cells (data not shown). The sterol ester mass was clearly visible for all mutants, ruling out a lipid extraction error for the DKO strain. To further examine the ability of these strains to synthesize TAG, cells in log phase were pulse-labeled with [3H]oleate, and its incorporation into TAG was measured (Fig. 1A). No significant differences in oleate incorporation into TAG were detected between wild type and the Δdga1 mutant. However, TAG synthesis decreased by nearly 50% due to the loss of Plh1p. Most notably, the double mutant was almost totally deficient in TAG synthesis. In contrast, sterol ester biosynthesis was normal in all mutants (data not shown). In the budding yeast, it has been confirmed that Are1p and/or Are2p are responsible for the residual TAG synthesis activity (about 3% of the wild type level). In S. pombe, there are two proteins (GeneDB systematic names: SPAC13G7.05 and SPCP1E11.05) that share strong homology with Are1p and Are2p. We have determined that these two homologs catalyze sterol esterification in S. pombe (data not shown); however, whether these proteins have a role in TAG synthesis remains to be examined. To confirm that either Plh1p or Dga1p was sufficient for TAG synthesis, we overexpressed plh1+ and dga1+ in wild type and DKO strains. Both genes were placed under the control of a modified nmt1 promoter (21Basi G. Schmid E. Maundrell K. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 123: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar), and each gene was able to complement the TAG synthesis defect in the DKO mutant, indicating an overlapping function of these two genes (Fig. 1B). Overexpression of plh+ and dga1+ also caused a significant increase in TAG synthesis in WT and mutant strains, suggesting these genes could be regulated at transcription level. These results imply that TAG synthesis is mediated by two gene products in fission yeast, whereas Plh1p plays a major role at log phase. To further confirm the absence of TAG in the DKO strain, we treated yeast cells with Nile Red, a fluorescent dye with strong and specific affinity for neutral lipids (28Greenspan P. Mayer E.P. Fowler S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 965-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (1842) Google Scholar). In both of the wild type and DKO cells, cytoplasmic fluorescent droplets could be seen in early stationary phase cultures. However, the number and intensity of the droplets observed in DKO cells was significantly less than those in wild type strains (Fig. 1C). In Vitro Microsomal Assays of DAG Esterification—The results described above demonstrated the essential roles of Plh1p and Dga1p in TAG synthesis; however, they did n"

Here we report a role of the stress-induced p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) in the component of M. tuberculosis phagosome maturation arrest that has been linked previously to the reduced recruitment of the endosomal and phagosomal membrane-tethering molecule called early endosome autoantigen 1 (EEA1; Fratti, R. A., Backer, J. M., Gruenberg, J., Corvera, S., and Deretic, V. (2001) J. Cell Biol. 154, 631–644). A pharmacological inhibition of M. tuberculosis var. bovis Bacillus Calmette-Guérin-induced p38 MAPK activity caused a marked increase in EEA1 colocalization with mycobacterial phagosomes. Consistent with the increase in EEA1 association and its role in phagosomal maturation, the pharmacological block of p38 activity caused phagosomal acidification and enrichment of the late endocytic markers lysobisphosphatidic acid and CD63 (lysosomal integral membrane protein 1) on mycobacterial phagosomes. A negative regulatory role of p38 MAPK activation in phagosome maturation was further demonstrated by converse experiments with latex bead phagosomes. Artificial activation of p38 MAPK caused a decrease in EEA1 colocalization with model latex bead phagosomes, which normally acquire EEA1 and subsequently mature into the phagolysosome. These findings show that p38 MAPK activity contributes to the arrest of M. tuberculosis phagosome maturation and demonstrate a negative regulatory role of p38 in phagolysosome biogenesis.

Mycobacterial phagosomes exclude or alter the dynamics of EEA1 acquisition and thus avoid further maturation into the phagolysosome.Recent studies by Gruenberg and co-workers have demonstrated that endocytic pathway and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) stress signaling are interconnected (28Cavalli V.

In this work we examined whether the activation of p38 plays a role in EEA1 exclusion from M. tuberculosis phagosomes and in inhibiting the maturation of mycobacterial phagosomes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Line and Bacterial Culture Conditions—The murine macrophage-like cell line, J774, was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with l-glutamine and 5% fetal bovine serum. M. tuberculosis var. bovis BCG harboring phsp60-gfp (30Dhandayuthapani S. Via L.E. Thomas C.A. Horowitz P.M. Deretic D. Deretic V. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 901-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) was grown in Middlebrook 7H9 broth. Single cell suspensions were generated using a Tenbroek tissue grinder, followed by a 5-min pulse in a water bath sonicator. Remaining bacterial aggregates were removed by centrifugation.Phagosome Purification—Synchronization of latex beads and M. tuberculosis var. bovis BCG phagocytosis was achieved by allowing latex beads or M. tuberculosis var. bovis BCG to attach to macrophages cooled to 4 °C without allowing uptake. Samples were shifted to 37 °C for the required periods of time, and mycobacterial or latex bead phagosomes were isolated and characterized as described previously (10Via L.E. Deretic D. Ulmer R.J. Hibler N.S. Huber L.A. Deretic V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13326-13331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Briefly, for mycobacterial phagosomes, macrophages were infected with a multiplicity of infection of 25 M. tuberculosis var. bovis BCG input per macrophage. Cells were mechanically lysed by passage through 22-gauge needles connected to a syringe apparatus. Cellular debris and nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 200 × g to generate post-nuclear supernatants. Post-nuclear supernatants from different samples were sedimented by centrifugation through a sucrose step gradient of 8.5, 15, and 50% sucrose at 1,000 × g for 45 min. The sediment from the 15 and 50% sucrose samples was collected and loaded onto a linear 32–53% sucrose gradient. Organelles were separated by isopycnic centrifugation (100,000 × g for 15 h). Membranes were pelleted from each fraction by centrifugation at 250,000 × g for 40 min and resuspended in Hepes-KCl. For latex bead phagosome purification, J774 cells were infected with latex beads and incubated as indicated above. Latex bead phagosomal compartments (LBCs) were isolated from post-nuclear supernatants by flotation as described (22Desjardins M. Huber L.A. Parton R.G.F. Griffiths G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 677-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar).Treatment with Inhibitors—When required, cells were pre-treated with SB203580 (10 μm) or PD98059 (10 μm) (Calbiochem) at 37 °C for 1 h prior to infection. Some cells were also treated with 1 mm H2O2 during the infection period. All treatments remained throughout the experiment.Epifluorescence and Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy—Macrophages grown on glass coverslips were infected with latex beads or M. tuberculosis var. bovis BCG. Synchronization of infection was achieved by centrifugation of particles onto macrophages at 107 × g for 5 min. Macrophages were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilization was achieved with 0.2% saponin. After blocking, cells were incubated with primary antibody followed by secondary Alexa 568-conjugated antibody (Molecular Probes). LysoTracker Red DND-99 staining of acidic organelles was carried out as described previously (31Via L.E. Fratti R.A. McFalone M. Pagan-Ramos E. Deretic D. Deretic V. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 897-905Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Epifluorescence microscopy images were collected and processed using LSR Esprit software. Confocal fluorescence microscopy images were collected and processed using the PerkinElmer Life Sciences UltraView confocal microscopy system. Colocalization of endocytic markers with phagosomes were determined using the previously described methods of unbiased counting (11Fratti R.A. Backer J.M. Gruenberg J. Corvera S. Deretic V. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 631-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 32Botelho R.J. Hackam D.J. Schreiber A.D. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15717-15727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).Western Blot Analysis—For immunoblots of phagosomes, equal amounts of MPCs and LBCs (by protein) were separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were probed with primary antibodies followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. When comparing MPCs and LBCs on discontinuous membranes, antibody incubations as well as ECL reactions were performed on these membranes simultaneously. When examining the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, cells were lysed with ice-cold lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 μm okadaic acid, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, and protease inhibitors) on ice for 30 min while shaking. Bound antibodies were visualized using the ECL Western blotting system. Membranes were exposed to film simultaneously, and identical exposure times were used.Antibodies—For Western blotting and immunofluorescence experiments, we used antibodies against EEA1 (from S. Corvera, University of Massachusetts, Worcester, MA), GDP dissociation inhibitor (GDI; from A. Sheshiva, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI), lysobisphosphatidic acid (LBPA) (from J. Gruenberg, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland), p38 MAPK (Transduction Labs), phospho-p38 MAPK (Cell Signaling Technology), Rab5 (from L. Huber, Research Institute of Molecular Pathology, Vienna, Austria), syntaxin 8 (provided by W. Hong, Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, Singapore), and CD63 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).Statistical Analysis—All statistical analyses were calculated using Fisher's protected least squares difference (LSD) post hoc test (ANOVA) (SuperANOVA 1.11, Abacus Concepts, Inc.). p values of ≤ 0.05 were considered significant.RESULTSp38 MAPK Activation during Mycobacterial Infection—To determine the activation state of p38 MAPK after the uptake of M. tuberculosis var. bovis BCG, we monitored the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK by Western blot using a phospho-specific antibody (Fig. 1). Cells were allowed to phagocytose latex beads or M. tuberculosis var. bovis BCG for 15 min prior to lysis and Western blot analysis. Although both latex beads and M. tuberculosis var. bovis BCG caused an increase in p38 phosphorylation, M. tuberculosis var. bovis BCG caused a significantly greater level of p38 activation (Fig. 1, lane 2) relative to latex beads (Fig. 1, lane 1). To determine whether the phosphorylation of p38 was due to autophosphorylation or to cross-talk between the p38 pathway and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway, we used specific inhibitors to monitor p38 phosphorylation. Treating cells with the p38-specific inhibitor SB203580 completely inhibited M. tuberculosis var. bovis BCG-mediated p38 activation (Fig. 1, lane 3), whereas the extracellular signal-regulated kinase-specific inhibitor PD98059 had no effect (Fig. 1, lane 4). As a positive control for p38 MAPK activation, cells were treated with 1 mm H2O2 for 15 min in the presence or absence of SB203580 or PD98059. As expected, exposing macrophages to H2O2 caused a marked increase in the phosphorylation of p38 (Fig. 1, lane 6) relative to untreated cells (Fig. 1, lane 5). This was inhibited when cells were treated with SB203580 (Fig. 1, lane 7) but not when they were treated with PD98059 (Fig. 1, lane 8).Inhibition of p38 MAPK Activity Enhances EEA1 Recruitment to Mycobacterial Phagosomes—Previously, we have reported that the exclusion of EEA1 from M. tuberculosis var. bovis BCG phagosomes is a critical event in mycobacterial phagosome maturation arrest (11Fratti R.A. Backer J.M. Gruenberg J. Corvera S. Deretic V. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 631-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Because EEA1 can be excluded from endosomes upon activation of p38 MAPK (28Cavalli V. Vilbois F. Corti M. Marcote M.J. Tamura K. Karin M. Arkinstall S. Gruenberg J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 421-432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) and M. tuberculosis is known to stimulate p38 MAPK activation (29Perskvist N. Zheng L. Stendahl O. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 959-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), we tested whether inhibiting p38 MAPK activity could restore the maturation of mycobacterial phagosomes. Cells were treated with the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 or carrier (Me2SO) alone and infected with M. tuberculosis var. bovis BCG. Mycobacterial phagosomes were examined for EEA1 recruitment. We found that inhibiting p38 MAPK with SB203580 caused a 250% increase in mycobacterial phagosome colocalization with EEA1 in SB203580-treated cells relative to control (Figs. 2, A–F, and 3) (p = 0.0001; ANOVA). The colocalization of EEA1 and mycobacteria was confirmed by confocal microscopy (Fig. 2, M–O). These findings suggest that the exclusion of EEA1 from mycobacterial phagosomes relative to model latex bead phagosomes is, in part, due to p38 MAPK-mediated EEA1 displacement from phagosomal membranes (28Cavalli V. Vilbois F. Corti M. Marcote M.J. Tamura K. Karin M. Arkinstall S. Gruenberg J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 421-432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar).Fig. 2Inhibition of p38 MAPK activity enhances EEA1 recruitment and maturation of mycobacterial phagosomes.

Backer J.M. Gruenberg J. Corvera S. Deretic V. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 631-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). To test whether inhibiting M. tuberculosis-mediated p38 MAPK activation causes the acquisition of late endocytic traits, we examined the accumulation of the late endosome-specific marker lysobisphosphatidic acid (33Kobayashi T. Stang E. Fang K.S. de Moerloose P. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. Nature. 1998; 392: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). LBPA, which is excluded from mycobacterial phagosomes, is acquired by model phagosomes in an EEA1-dependent manner (11Fratti R.A. Backer J.M. Gruenberg J. Corvera S. Deretic V. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 631-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Thus, treatments that cause increases in EEA1 acquisition are expected to correspond with an accelerated maturation rate that can be measured by the acquisition of LBPA. When cells were treated with SB203580, we found the LBPA localization on mycobacterial phagosomes was increased by nearly 300% relative to untreated macrophages (Figs. 2, G–I, and 3) (p = 0.0001; ANOVA). Additional markers of phagosomal maturation, LysoTracker Red DND-99, which accumulates in acidic organelles, including properly acidified phagosomes (31Via L.E. Fratti R.A. McFalone M. Pagan-Ramos E. Deretic D. Deretic V. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 897-905Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the lysosomal integral membrane protein CD63 were tested by confocal fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 4, A–L). A >2-fold increase in the accumulation of LysoTracker Red DND-99 and CD63 on mycobacterial phagosomes was associated with SB203580 treatment (Fig. 4, M and N). These findings show that mycobacteria-induced p38 MAPK activity plays a role in the arrest of phagosomes containing M. tuberculosis var. bovis BCG by affecting EEA1 recruitment and subsequent trafficking events as reported previously (11Fratti R.A. Backer J.M. Gruenberg J. Corvera S. Deretic V. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 631-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar).Fig. 4Inhibition of p38 MAPK enhances CD63 recruitment to mycobacterial phagosomes and their acidification.

Quantitation of LysoTracker Red DND-99 (n = 424) (M) and CD63 (n = 827) (N) colocalization with the phagosomes took place 30 min post-infection for LysoTracker Red DND-99 (LT) and 30, 60, and 120 min post infection for CD63 in SB 203580 (SB)-treated and control cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Mycobacterial Phagosomes Retain GDI—Gruenberg and colleagues (28Cavalli V. Vilbois F. Corti M. Marcote M.J. Tamura K. Karin M. Arkinstall S. Gruenberg J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 421-432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) have found that, during the activation of p38 MAPK, Rab GDI is phosphorylated, resulting in its higher state of activation and affinity for Rab5. Consequently, GDI activation causes a net displacement of EEA1 from endocytic membranes (28Cavalli V. Vilbois F. Corti M. Marcote M.J. Tamura K. Karin M. Arkinstall S. Gruenberg J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 421-432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). When we examined phagosomal membranes for the presence of GDI, we found that purified MPCs consistently contained GDI (Fig. 5, A and B), whereas GDI was not detected on isolated LBCs (Fig. 5, A and B). The persistence of GDI on mycobacterial phagosomes is consistent with a higher state of GDI activity, resulting in an increased steady state level of membrane-associated GDI. This correlates with the higher activation state of p38 MAPK in cells infected with M. tuberculosis var. bovis BCG relative to those that have ingested latex beads. To test whether p38 activation causes GDI accumulation on phagosomes, we isolated LBCs from cells treated with H2O2 in the presence or absence of SB203580 (Fig. 5C). We found that activating p38 resulted in the retention of GDI on LBCs (Fig. 5C). The effect of p38 activity on GDI retention by latex bead phagosomes was reversed when cells were treated with SB203580. The link between p38 activity and GDI retention is specific, because other agents that arrest phagosome maturation, such as wortmannin and brefeldin A, did not cause GDI association with LBCs.Fig. 5GDI retention on mycobacterial phagosomes.A, Western blot analysis of purified LBCs and MPCs from macrophages following synchronized infection after 20, 40, and 60 min of phagocytosis.

In yeast and mammals copper acquisition occurs through the action of the Ctr1 family of high affinity copper transporters. Here we describe studies using Drosophila melanogaster to investigate the role of copper acquisition through Ctr1 in normal growth and development. Three distinct Drosophila Ctr1 genes (Ctr1A, Ctr1B, and Ctr1C) have been identified, which have unique expression patterns over the course of development. Interestingly, Ctr1B, which is expressed exclusively during the late embryonic and larval stages of development, is transcriptionally activated in response to nutritionally induced copper deprivation and down-regulated in response to copper adequacy. The generation of Ctr1B mutant flies results in decreased larval copper accumulation, marked body pigmentation defects that parallel defects in tyrosinase activity, and specific developmental arrest under conditions of both nutritional copper limitation and excess. These studies establish that copper acquisition through the Drosophila Ctr1B transporter is crucial for normal growth and in early and specific stages of metazoan development.

These studies establish that copper acquisition through the Drosophila Ctr1B transporter is crucial for normal growth and in early and specific stages of metazoan development. The normal growth and development of eukaryotic cells and organisms require appropriate spatial and temporal patterns of gene expression, signal transduction, and biosynthetic and metabolic reactions. Key to these important biochemical reactions is the availability of many enzymatic co-factors that are acquired dietarily. One such co-factor is copper, a trace metal that is essential for normal growth and development (1Puig S. Thiele D.J. Curr. Opin. Chem.

Indeed, copper serves as a catalytic co-factor for a wide variety of enzymes that play general roles in cell growth and protection including cytochrome oxidase (energy generation), ceruloplasmin (iron mobilization), and Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (oxidative stress protection), as well as enzymes with specialized roles in development such as tyrosinase (pigmentation) and peptidylglycyl-α amidating monooxygenase (neuropeptide processing) (4Askwith C.

Although copper plays many essential biochemical roles that may be crucial to normal growth and development, copper can also be a potent cytotoxin when allowed to accumulate in excess of cellular needs (10Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M. Mol. Aspects Med. 1985; 8: 89-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). Cells have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to control copper homeostasis at the level of uptake, distribution, sequestration, and export (1Puig S. Thiele D.J. Curr. Opin. Chem.

Upon delivery of copper by Ctr1 proteins to the interior of cells, it is transferred to copper-dependent enzymes, or the compartments where these enzymes are assembled, via the action of three copper-binding chaperones: CCS for delivery to Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase, Atx1/Atox1 for delivery to secretory compartments, and Cox17 for delivery to mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase (11Culotta V.C.

The importance of copper and the Ctr1 high affinity copper transporter in development is demonstrated by the observations that mice bearing a targeted deletion of the Ctr1 gene exhibit profound developmental defects and die in utero approximately midway through gestation (21Lee J.

A. 2001; 98: 6836-6841Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Furthermore, clear tissue-specific defects in copper accumulation, and in the activities of copper-dependent enzymes, are manifest in heterozygous Ctr1 knockout mice and in Ctr1-/- embryonic fibroblasts (21Lee J.

However, because of the early lethality of Ctr1-/- mice and the failure to rescue this phenotype by dietary copper, the precise roles that copper and Ctr1 play in mammalian development are not well understood. Drosophila melanogaster is a powerful model system for dissecting the identity and function of genes that play crucial roles in gene expression, signal transduction, and other important events in metazoan development. Although little is known about the mechanisms for copper accumulation and homeostasis in flies, previous studies have demonstrated the existence of specialized cells, denoted copper cells (24Filshie B.K. Poulson D.F. Waterhouse D.F. Tissue Cell. 1971; 3: 77-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), that line the lumen of the middle mid-gut and that accumulate high levels of copper in lysosomes (25Tapp R.L. J.

Genet. 1987; 24: 127-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), are likely to have important developmental functions in flies. In this work we have identified three Drosophila genes encoding high affinity copper transporters in the Ctr1 family that exhibit distinct expression profiles in fly development. One copper transporter, Ctr1B, is exclusively expressed in the late embryonic and larval stages of development, and Ctr1B mRNA levels are induced under conditions of copper limitation. The generation of Ctr1B mutant flies results in markedly decreased larval copper accumulation, abdominal pigmentation defects that parallel defects in tyrosinase activity, and a terminal developmental arrest at the second instar larval stage under conditions of nutritional copper limitation. These studies demonstrate the importance of copper delivery for the activation of specific copper-dependent enzymes, via Ctr1, and for early and defined stages of normal metazoan development. Cloning and the Expression of Drosophila Ctr1 Genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae—Three potential copper transporter (Ctr1) genes were identified from the D. melanogaster genome by a BLAST search at the Flybase web site (flybase.bio.indiana.edu/) using human Ctr1 and Schizosaccharomyces pombe Ctr5 protein sequences as probes; the three genes were designated Ctr1A, Ctr1B, and Ctr1C. Ctr1A (Flybase no. CG3977) was directly cloned from a Drosophila embryo cDNA library by PCR methods with gene-specific primers (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Ctr1B (Flybase no. CG7459) was cloned from a genetic screen in the S. cerevisiae ctr1Δctr3Δ strain MPY17, which is deficient in high affinity copper transport and, consequently, cannot grow on nonfermentable carbon sources (29Labbé S. Peña M.M. Fernandes A.R. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36252-36260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This strain was transformed with a Drosophila cDNA library expressed from the constitutive yeast ADH1 promoter (30Elledge S.J. Mulligan J.T. Ramer S.W. Spottswood M. Davis R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1731-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), and transformants were identified that complement the respiratory growth defect of ctr1Δctr3Δ cells. The full sequence of the Ctr1B cDNA was recovered twice from the screen (data not shown). Ctr1C (Flybase no. CG15551) was cloned by reverse transcriptase-PCR from third instar larval and S2 cell RNA. The PCR products were subcloned into the SpeI/EcoRI sites of the S. cerevisiae expression vector p413GPD (31Mumberg D. Muller R. Funk M. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 156: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1579) Google Scholar). The plasmids were transformed into the strain MPY17, and growth on SC-His and YPEG was assayed. Copper Transport Assays—The Ctr1A, Ctr1B, and Ctr1C open reading frames were subcloned into the expression vector pAC5.1A (Clontech). S2 cells were independently transfected with these plasmids or the empty vector using FuGENE 6 (Roche) and cultured in Schneider medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum. After 48 h, cells were washed with fresh medium and incubated with 1 μm64CuCl2 for 10 min at room temperature before washing with cold 20 μm EDTA to terminate 64Cu uptake, followed by phosphate-buffered saline, and counted with a Cobra II γ counter (Packard). Fly Stocks and Genetics—To generate a Drosophila Ctr1B null allele, an imprecise P element excision strategy was used (32Rørth P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12418-12422Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). The EP(3)833 line, which harbors a single P element ∼800 bp upstream of the Ctr1B transcription start site, was obtained from the Bloomington Stock Center (Bloomington, IN). This strain was crossed to a transposase-expressing Δ2–3 Sb/TM6 line, and the Sb/p[w+] male progeny were crossed to TM3/TM6 females. The male w/Y; Sb+ progeny were pooled into groups of 30–40, crossed to TM3/TM6 females, and genomic DNA was extracted from the eggs laid by these pools. PCR reactions with primers OHZ115 and OHZ146 were performed using genomic DNA as template. Males in the pools that gave shorter products than predicted precise excision were separated and individually crossed to TM3/TM6 females; their progeny were again characterized by the PCR method described above, and the DNA sequence in the Ctr1B region determined. Among ∼1,500 independent excision events, 12 imprecise excision events, carrying different deletions in the Ctr1B genomic region, were identified. Several precise excision events, with 8-bp sequence differences from the wild type, were also recovered. The deficiency line Df(3R) p40, which removes the entire Ctr1B genomic region, was acquired from the Bloomington Stock Center. Flies were raised on standard glucose/yeast fly food defined as 10% d-dextrose, 10% yeast peptone, 1.5% agar, and 0.3% Tegosept (33Ashburner M. Drosophila: A Laboratory Handbook. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). RNA Extraction and Copper Accumulation Studies—Flies were allowed to lay eggs on normal yeast/glucose food or with either copper- or bathocuproine disulfonate (BCS) 1The abbreviations used are: BCSbathocuproine disulfonateICPMSinductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometryTTMtetrathiomolybdatePHMpeptidylglycyl α-amidating monooxygenase.-supplemented food, and were allowed to develop into late third instar larvae before wandering, when they were collected and total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). RNA blots were performed as described (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and the membranes were scanned by PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Larvae collected in the same manner were digested with 0.1 m hot nitric acid and total body copper accumulation determined by ICP-MS in triplicate (34Woodhouse L.R. Abrams S.A. Advances in Isotope Methods for the Analysis of Trace Elements in Man. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL2001: 1-22Google Scholar). bathocuproine disulfonate inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry tetrathiomolybdate peptidylglycyl α-amidating monooxygenase. Fly Development Assays—ctr1B3–4/TM6 and the +/TM6 precise excision flies were self-crossed and allowed to lay eggs on food supplemented with different metals or metal chelators. The density of the eggs was controlled for each vial such that 80–150 adult progeny emerged. The progeny with different genotypes were counted as F1 adults, and the frequency of development to adulthood of the homozygous flies was calculated by dividing the number of homozygous progeny with the expected number according to Mendel's law. For data presentation we used the relative development index to adulthood to reflect the survival of ctr1B3–4 homozygous adult flies on different types of food. The development rate on each food type was normalized with the rate on normal food to give the relative development index, and the difference between wild type and ctr1B3–4 flies was compared. The hatching rate of ctr1B3–4 homozygotes was normal, as 100% of the eggs laid by ctr1B3–4/TM6 flies hatched into first instar larvae, as counted on grape juice plates. Body Pigmentation and Tyrosinase Assays—ctr1B3–4/TM6 and +/TM6 flies were grown on food supplemented with 100 μm AgNO3 and 100 μm BCS and adults photographed within 4 h after emergence. For tyrosinase assays, total protein was extracted from late pupae or young adults and the in-gel tyrosinase assay was performed as previously described (23Lee J. Petris M.J. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40253-40259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The Drosophila Genome Encodes Three Ctr1 Family Copper Transporters—We have initiated studies of copper homeostasis in D. melanogaster to begin to understand the roles of copper and the Ctr1 family of copper transporters in metazoan development. The completion of the Drosophila genome DNA sequence allowed a genome-wide search for potential Ctr1 family members. Using sequences from mammalian and yeast Ctr1 family members (14Zhou B. Gitschier J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7481-7486Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 15Lee J. Prohaska J.R. Dagenais S.L. Glover T.W. Thiele D.J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 20529-20535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) in BLAST searches, we identified three Ctr1 homologs, encoded by distinct genes, in the Drosophila genome. All three share common structural features with other Ctr1 family members that include the presence of three predicted transmembrane domains with conserved hydrophobic sequences, the MX3M motif in the second transmembrane domain, and a conserved methionine residue preceding the first transmembrane domain that is essential for Ctr1 function in yeast and mammals (17Puig S. Lee J. Lau M. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26021-26030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). We predicted that the three genes encode putative Ctr1 family copper transporters, and denoted these genes and their encoded proteins Ctr1A, Ctr1B, and Ctr1C. We also detected two apparent splicing isoforms of Ctr1A that differed by 10 amino acids (data not shown), and therefore designated these as Ctr1A-L (Ctr1A long, 217 amino acid residues) and Ctr1A-S (Ctr1A short, 207 amino acid residues). As an initial test of whether the putative Drosophila Ctr1 family members function as high affinity copper transporters, we expressed each cDNA in an S. cerevisiae mutant strain to test whether they can suppress the respiratory deficiency that results from defects in high affinity copper uptake (12Dancis A. Yuan D.S. Haile D. Askwith C. Eide D. Moehle C. Kaplan J. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 393-402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, the expression of each of the three Drosophila Ctr1 cDNAs in yeast can suppress this respiratory deficiency, as indicated by their ability to restore growth on the nonfermentable carbon sources glycerol and ethanol in these cells. To test whether these Ctr1 family members stimulate copper transport activity in Drosophila cells, we expressed them under actin promoter by transfection in S2 cells and 64Cu uptake studies were carried out. As shown in Fig. 2B, expression of either Ctr1A or Ctr1B strongly stimulated copper uptake from the medium. Although no stimulation of copper uptake was observed with a Ctr1C expression vector in S2 cells, it is currently unclear whether the encoded protein is poorly expressed, improperly localized, or naturally resides on the membrane of an intracellular compartment. Taken together, the structural features of the Drosophila Ctr1A, Ctr1B, and Ctr1C proteins; their function in yeast; and their ability to stimulate 64Cu uptake in cultured S2 cells strongly suggest that these proteins function in copper transport in Drosophila. The Drosophila Ctr1 Family Is Differentially Expressed during Development—To gain insight into the potential roles of the three distinct Ctr1 family members, the expression profile of these genes was assessed during Drosophila development. Fertilized eggs from wild type flies were collected and allowed to mature for 4-h intervals before total RNA was extracted. RNA was also extracted from wandering third instar larvae, adults, and cultured S2 cells, and the expression profile for Ctr1A, Ctr1B, and Ctr1C was assessed by RNA blotting. As shown in Fig. 3, the three Ctr1 genes displayed very distinct expression patterns during development. Ctr1A was constitutively expressed at all stages represented in the experiment, with relatively minor variations in early and late embryos, as well as slightly elevated levels in females as compared with male adults. S2 cells, which have an embryonic origin (36Schneider I. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1972; 27: 353-365PubMed Google Scholar), also express high levels of Ctr1A mRNA. Ctr1B was robustly expressed in late embryonic stages and larval stages, but was poorly expressed in early embryonic stages and adults, and not detectable in S2 cells. Ctr1C expression was also found in late larval stages, and interestingly, in adult males, but was not detected at other stages of development or in S2 cells. These observations suggest that the three Ctr1 genes might have distinct roles in copper homeostasis during Drosophila development. Ctr1B Expression Is Regulated by Dietary Copper Availability—Because Ctr1B was most strongly expressed in the larval stages of development, when flies absorb most of their nutrients and build body mass, we reasoned that Ctr1B might play a major role in copper uptake in early stages of the Drosophila life cycle and therefore further characterized this gene in detail. Although Ctr1 family members share common structural and functional features across species, there is an important difference among organisms in the regulation of Ctr1 gene expression. Genes encoding Ctr1 family members in bakers' yeast and fission yeast are transcriptionally regulated by copper availability and by copper metalloregulatory transcription factors; expression of Ctr1 mRNA is high during copper scarcity and low under conditions of copper adequacy (29Labbé S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 15951-15958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In contrast, studies in cultured mammalian cells or whole animals thus far indicate no significant changes in Ctr1 mRNA as a function of copper status, but rather copper levels regulate changes in Ctr1 trafficking and stability (15Lee J. Prohaska J.R. Dagenais S.L. Glover T.W. Thiele D.J. Gene. 2000; 254: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 39Petris M.J. Smith K. Lee J. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9639-9646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). To determine whether Drosophila Ctr1A, Ctr1B or Ctr1C mRNA expression is regulated by dietary copper availability, wild type larvae were raised on food supplemented with either 100 μm CuSO4 or 10 μm of the Cu(I)-specific chelator BCS, RNA was extracted and analyzed by RNA blotting. Ctr1A and Ctr1C mRNA levels were not detectably altered in response to the changes in copper availability imposed by these conditions (data not shown). However, as shown in Fig. 4A (lanes +/+), Drosophila Ctr1B steady state mRNA levels were strongly regulated by dietary copper availability. When wild type larvae were grown on food supplemented with 100 μm CuSO4 Ctr1B mRNA levels were significantly reduced as compared with larvae raised on normal food. Conversely, the inclusion of BCS in fly food, to limit copper availability by chelation, resulted in a significant elevation in Ctr1B steady state mRNA levels. As a control for the imposed changes in copper availability in food, steady state mRNA levels for a metallothionein isoform encoded by the MtnA gene were assessed. Metallothionein A (MtnA) is one of four metallothionein isoform genes in flies that bind copper and other metals and protect flies from metal toxicity (40Lastowski-Perry D. Otto E. Maroni G. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1527-1530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Egli D. Selvaraj A. Yepiskoposyan H. Zhang B. Hafen E. Georgiev O. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 100-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). These four genes are transcriptionally induced by elevated copper levels and the metalloregulatory transcription factor MTF1 (41Egli D. Selvaraj A. Yepiskoposyan H. Zhang B. Hafen E. Georgiev O. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 100-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 42Zhang B. Egli D. Georgiev O. Schaffner W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4505-4514Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4A, MtnA mRNA expression follows a pattern that is opposite to that of Ctr1B, with MtnA being strongly induced by exogenous copper, but not induced by copper limitation. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the Ctr1B member of the high affinity copper transporter family is regulated by dietary copper availability in a manner consistent with a predicted role in copper acquisition in Drosophila. Generation of Ctr1B Mutants—To investigate the physiological function of Ctr1B, a Ctr1B loss-of-function mutation was generated in flies by imprecise excision of a P element transposon adjacent to the Ctr1B locus. We performed 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends to determine the Ctr1B transcription start site and found that Ctr1B transcription initiates ∼20 bp further upstream than was predicted at www.flybase.org (data not shown). Using a fly strain harboring a P-element upstream of the Ctr1B initiation site (32Rørth P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12418-12422Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar), flies were generated and selected in which imprecise excision events eliminated the P-element and variable lengths of downstream flanking sequences, without perturbation of sequences upstream of the P-element. One such allele, ctr1B3–4, suffered a deletion of ∼1.2 kb of chromosomal sequence, which removed the entire first exon of the Ctr1B gene, including the transcription start site and the ATG start codon (Fig. 4B). To verify the loss of Ctr1B expression in this background, RNA blotting experiments were carried out on total RNA isolated from homozygous ctr1B3–4 third instar larvae. As shown in Fig. 4A, homozygous ctr1B3-4 larvae (-/-) expressed no detectable Ctr1B RNA under any growth condition, whereas ctr1B3-4 heterozygous larvae (+/-) expressed less than the wild type under all conditions of growth. Isogenic flies harboring an allele with a precise P-element excision expressed Ctr1B mRNA at levels that were indistinguishable from the wild type under all conditions analyzed (data not shown). Because the precise excision line is isogenic to the ctr1B3–4 mutant, we used this line as the wild type control for further analysis. Defective Copper Homeostasis in Ctr1B Mutant Larvae—The analysis of MtnA expression, as a control for Ctr1B regulation by copper, demonstrated that the expression level of MtnA in homozygous ctr1B3–4 flies was significantly lower under all conditions (Fig. 4A). Because MtnA expression is tightly regulated by t"

The sequence of mPAPLA1β encodes a 460-amino acid protein containing a lipase domain with significant homology to the previously identified phosphatidic acid (PA)-selective PLA1, mPA-PLA1α. mPA-PLA1β contains a short lid and deleted β9 loop, which are characteristics of PLA1 molecules in the lipase family, and is a member of a subfamily in the lipase family that includes mPA-PLA1α and phosphatidylserine-specific PLA1. Both mPA-PLA1β and mPA-PLA1α recombinant proteins exhibited PA-specific PLA1 activity and were vanadate-sensitive. When mPAPLA1β-expressing cells were treated with bacterial phospholipase D, the cells produced lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). In both mPA-PLA1α and β-expressing cells, most of the PA generated by the phospholipase D (PLD) treatment was converted to LPA, whereas in control cells it was converted to diacylglycerol. When expressed in HeLa cells most mPA-PLA1α protein was recovered from the cell supernatant. By contrast, mPA-PLA1β was recovered almost exclusively from cells. Consistent with this observation, we found that mPA-PLA1β has higher affinity to heparin than mPA-PLA1α. We also found that the membrane-associated mPA-PLA1s were insoluble in solubilization by 1% Triton X-100 and were detected in Triton X-100-insoluble buoyant fractions of sucrose gradients. The present study raises the possibility that production of LPA by mPA-PLA1α and -β occurs on detergent-resistant membrane domains of the cells where they compete with lipid phosphate phosphatase for PA.

PLA1 is a group of enzymes that hydrolyzes the sn-1 fatty acids from phospholipids. Recent studies have identified several molecules that exhibited PLA1 activities in mammals (11.Sonoda H. Aoki J.

These PLA1 isozymes can be classified into two groups based on their structures and cellular localization. One group are intracellular enzymes that include phosphatidic acid-preferring phospholipase A1 (PA-PLA1), an enzyme purified and cloned from bovine testis (21.Higgs H.N. Han M.H. Johnson G.E. Glomset J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5468-5477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and KIAA0725 identified as a PA-PLA1 homologue, which has a wide variety of substrates (24.Nakajima K.

The other group are extracellular enzymes that include phosphatidylserine-specific PLA1 (PS-PLA1) (20.Sato T. Aoki J. Nagai Y. Dohmae N. Takio K. Doi T. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol.

We recently identified membrane-associated PA-selective PLA1 (designated in this study as mPA-PLA1α) as a new member of extracellular PLA1s (11.Sonoda H. Aoki J. Hiramatsu T. Ishida M. Bandoh K. Nagai Y. Taguchi R. Inoue K. Arai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34254-34263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). All these molecules are members of the lipase family. Lipase is an enzyme that cleaves ester bonds at the sn-1 and sn-3 positions of triacylglycerol and has been implicated in triacylglycerol metabolism in blood. Mammals have at least 8 lipase-related genes that form a lipase family. Some of these enzymes have PLA1 activity, whereas the other do not. Indeed, hepatic lipase (HL), pancreatic lipase-related protein, EL, PS-PLA1, and mPA-PLA1α were shown to have PLA1 activity. HL (29.Gillett M.P. Vieira E.M. Dimenstein R. Int. J. Biochem. 1993; 25: 449-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), PLRP (30.Payne R.M. Sims H.F. Jennens M.L. Lowe M.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: 914-921PubMed Google Scholar), and EL (22.Jaye M.

PS-PLA1 is the best characterized PLA1 in this family (26.Aoki J. Nagai Y. Hosono H. Inoue K. Arai H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1582: 26-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). PS-PLA1 specifically hydrolyzes PS to produce lysophosphatidylserine, a potential lysophospholipid mediator with an activity to stimulate mast cell degranulation (31.Hosono H. Aoki J. Nagai Y. Bandoh K. Ishida M. Taguchi R. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29664-29670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and neurite outgrowth (32.Lourenssen S. Blennerhassett M.G. Neurosci. Lett. 1998; 248: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We recently showed that mPA-PLA1α-expressing insect cells produced LPA with unsaturated fatty acid but did not produce any other lysophospholipids (11.Sonoda H. Aoki J. Hiramatsu T. Ishida M. Bandoh K. Nagai Y. Taguchi R. Inoue K. Arai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34254-34263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The result suggested that mPA-PLA1α has a preference for PA, although a precise ligand specificity of mPA-PLA1α using a conventional PLA1 assay remained to be solved. When we compare the structures of these molecules, one striking feature of molecules belonging to the lipase family that show PLA1 activity is the existence of “short” or “mini” lids that surround the active sites of lipases (33.Carriere F. Withers M.C. van Tilbeurgh H. Roussel A. Cambillau C. Verger R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 417-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In most lipases such as pancreatic lipase, HL, and lipoprotein lipase, the lids are composed of 22 or 23 amino acids. By contrast, PS-PLA1, mPA-PLA1α, DolmI PLA1, and EL have short lids composed of 12, 12, 7, and 18 amino acids, respectively. The other domain structure that is characteristic of PLA1 is the β9 loop, which is also located in the vicinity of the active site of lipases (33.Carriere F. Withers M.C. van Tilbeurgh H. Roussel A. Cambillau C. Verger R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 417-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The loop is present in PL, HL, and lipoprotein lipase, whereas it is absent in PS-PLA1 and mPAPLA1α, DolmI PLA1. Thus, it is likely that simultaneous deletions of the β9 loop and the lid domain may determine the molecular characteristics of PLA1 in the lipase family. These molecular features may allow us to identify other PLA1 isozymes in the future. In this study as a part of our continuing study to clarify the biological function of PLA1 molecules, we identify a novel PLA1 molecule, mPA-PLA1β, which is a close homologue of mPA-PLA1α. We report here the biochemical characterization of both mPA-PLA1α and mPA-PLA1β as LPA-producing enzymes. Materials—Phospholipase D from Actinomadura was kindly donated by Meito Sangyo (Tokyo, Japan). 1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-PA (16:0, 18:1), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-PC (16:0, 18:1), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) (16:0, 18:1), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-PS (16:0, 18:1), and 1-oleoyl-LPA (18:1) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids. [14C]1-Palmitoyl-LPC and [3H]1-oleoyl-LPA (18:1) were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Other chemicals were purchased from Wako Chemicals (Osaka, Japan). Clone Identification—The expressed sequence tag clone AA470035 was identified by searching the GenBank™ EST data base using the amino acid sequence of mPA-PLA1α. The nucleotide sequence of the clone was determined by DNA sequence using the ABI377 autosequencer. To determine the N-terminal sequence of mPA-PLA1β, we conducted 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends using human testis Marathon-Ready™ cDNA (Clontech) and the Advantage2 PCR Kit (Clontech). We also amplified the cDNA of mPA-PLA1β by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using SUPERSCRIPT™ reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and Ex-Taq polymerase (Takara, Kyoto, Japan) from human testis-derived total RNA. The nucleotide sequence data reported in this paper have been submitted to the GenBank™ data base under accession number AY197607 for human mPA-PLA1β. Expression of mPA-PLA1β in Sf9 Cells—The DNA fragment covering the coding region of mPA-PLA1β (BamHI-NotI fragment) was subcloned into the BamHI and NotI sites of pFASTBAC1 transfer vector (Invitrogen) to generate a donor plasmid. Recombinant viruses were prepared using the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The resulting recombinant baculovirus was used to infect Sf9 cells. Sf9 insect cells were grown in a serum-free EX-CELL 420 insect cell medium (JRH Biosciences) at 27 °C. For infection, Sf9 cells were mixed with recombinant or wild-type Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus to produce a multiplicity of infection of 10 and incubated for 72 h at 27 °C. Expression of mPA-PLA1α and mPA-PLA1β in Mammalian Cells—HeLa and CHO-K1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 medium, respectively, supplemented with antibiotics, glutamine, and 10% fetal bovine serum under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The DNA fragment covering the coding region of mPA-PLA1α and mPA-PLA1β (both EcoRI-EcoRI fragments) were subcloned into the EcoRI site of pCAGGS mammalian expression vector (kindly donated by Dr. Junichi Miyazaki, Osaka University). The resulting cDNAs were used to transfect HeLa and CHO-K1 cells using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. PLA1Assay—Sf9 cells were harvested 72 h after baculovirus infection. The cells were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 8.1 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mm KH2PO4) and homogenized using a Branson sonifier. The supernatant obtained by centrifugation of the homogenate at 190 × g for 10 min was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The resulting pellet suspended in phosphate-buffered saline followed by freezing and thawing from -80 to 4 °C was used as the “membrane fractions.” The preparation of 1-[14C]palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate, 1-[14C]palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserine, 1-[14C]palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, and 1-[14C]palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine were prepared as described previously (20.Sato T.

Inoue K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1988; 103: 442-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The PLA1 activity was determined using the micelle assay system as described previously (20.Sato T. Aoki J. Nagai Y. Dohmae N. Takio K. Doi T. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2192-2198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-PA, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-PC, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-PE, or 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-PS (40 μm each) containing a 14C-labeled fatty acid at the sn-1 position, were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with membrane fractions prepared from mPAPLA1β- or mPA-PLA1α-expressing cells (each 100 μg of protein) in buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 4 mm CaCl2, and 0.1% cholic acid. The fatty acid liberated was extracted by a modification of Dole's method and radioactivity measured using a scintillation counter. The lipase activity was measured as described previously (20.Sato T. Aoki J. Nagai Y. Dohmae N. Takio K. Doi T. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2192-2198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) using 3H-labeled triolein as a substrate. Ca2+Assay—Evaluation of LPA3 activation was done by Ca2+ assays using LPA3-expressing Sf9 cells as described (16.Bandoh K. Aoki J. Tsujimoto M. Arai H. Inoue K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 478: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). 48 h after LPA3-baculovirus infection, the cells were loaded with 2 mm Fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (Fura-2 AM; Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR) for 45 min. After the free Fura-2 AM was washed out, agonist-induced Fura-2 AM fluorescence of samples in quartz cuvettes was measured by the ratio of emission wavelength of 500 nm by excitation wavelengths at 340 and 380 nm using a CAF-110 (Japan Spectroscopy, Inc., Tokyo, Japan). LPA Quantification and Lipid Preparation—Concentration of LPA was determined by an enzyme-linked fluorometric method described previously (35.Aoki J. Taira A. Takanezawa Y. Kishi Y. Hama K. Kishimoto T. Mizuno K. Saku K. Taguchi R. Arai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39696-39702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Phospholipids were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (36.Bligh E.C. Dyer W.F. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41844) Google Scholar) in acidic condition (by lowering the pH to 3.0 with 1 n HCl). Lipids in the aqueous phase were re-extracted and pooled with the previous organic phase. The extracted lipids were dried, dissolved in chloroform/methanol (1:1), and used for mass spectrometry analysis. A recovery of lipids was monitored by addition of trace amounts of 1-[3H]oleoyl-LPA in our samples. In our condition the recovery of 1-[3H]oleoyl-LPA was always >95%. MS Analysis—MS analysis was performed essentially as described previously (11.Sonoda H. Aoki J. Hiramatsu T. Ishida M. Bandoh K. Nagai Y. Taguchi R. Inoue K. Arai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34254-34263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) using Quattro Micro tandem quadrupole mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, United Kingdom) equipped with an electrospray ion source (ESI). Lipid extracts from cell culture supernatants and cells were analyzed by 2-μl aliquots of samples (0.1–50 pmol/μl) dissolved in chloroform/methanol (2:1). The samples were introduced by means of a flow injector into the ESI chamber, at the flow rate of 2 μl/min. The eluting solvent used was acetonitrile/methanol/water (2:3:1) containing 0.1% ammonium formate (pH 6.4). The mass spectrometer was operated in the positive and negative ion scan modes. The nitrogen drying gas flow rate was 12 liters/min, and its temperature was 80 °C. Essentially, the capillary voltage was set at 3.7 kV and the cone voltage was set at 30 V, both in the positive and negative ion modes. For MS/MS experiments, 3–4 × 10-4 torr of argon was used as collision gas, and a collision energy of 30–40 V was used for obtaining fragment ions for precursor ions. Antibodies—A peptide consisting of the C-terminal 19 amino acids of mPA-PLA1β (442CKDREEVFLNPNTCTPKNT460) was conjugated with keyhole limpet hemocyanin. The conjugate was used to immunize rats (WKY/Izm strain) in the hind footpads with Freund's complete adjuvant. The enlarged medial iliac lymph nodes from the rats were used for cell fusion with mouse myeloma cells, PAI. The antibody-secreting hybridoma cells were selected by screening with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunofluorescence, and Western blotting. The monoclonal antibody for mPA-PLA1α was prepared as described previously (11.Sonoda H. Aoki J. Hiramatsu T. Ishida M. Bandoh K. Nagai Y. Taguchi R. Inoue K. Arai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34254-34263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Western Blotting—Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using the Bio-Rad protein transfer system. The membranes were blocked with Tris-buffered saline containing 5% (w/v) skimmed milk and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, incubated with anti-mPA-PLA1β monoclonal antibody (clone H4C6), and then treated with anti-rat IgG-horseradish peroxidase. Proteins bound to the antibodies were visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Immunofluorescent Staining—Sf9 cells infected with baculoviruses grown on glass coverslips were fixed with ice-cold methanol, and blocked with 10% goat serum. After incubation with anti-mPA-PLA1β monoclonal antibody, followed by incubation with goat anti-rat IgG conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes, Inc.), the antibody was detected by a fluorescence microscope (Axiophot 2, Zeiss, Germany) and a confocal laser scanning microscope (Fluoview, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Human semen was collected from healthy volunteers. After ejaculation, samples were left stand at room temperature for 30 min, mixed with an equal volume of phosphate-buffered saline, and then strained through 24-gauge needle. The pellet of centrifugation at 500 × g for 10 min was used as sperm. Northern Blotting—Human poly(A)+ RNA blot was purchased from Origene Technologies. The PCR product of 3′-terminal 0.6 kb was used as a specific probe. The membrane was hybridized with a random-primed 32P-labeled probe at 65 °C for 4 h in a Rapid hybridization buffer (Amersham Biosciences). The blot was rinsed in 2× SSC at room temperature for 5 min, washed twice in 0.5× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 15 min, and used to expose Kodak X-Omat AR film (Eastman Kodak Co.) at -80 °C with an intensifying screen for 72 h. The blots were rehybridized with β-actin as an internal standard. Fractionation of Triton X-100-insoluble Membranes—Sucrose gradient centrifugation was used to isolate Triton X-100-insoluble membranes. Sf9 cells infected with baculoviruses were harvested 72 h after infection and suspended in TNE buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA) containing 1% Triton X-100. Then the cells were homogenized 10 strokes with a Dounce homogenizer. The homogenates were mixed with an equal volume of TNE buffer containing 80% sucrose. The sample was then transferred to a centrifuge tube and was overlaid with TNE buffer containing a linear gradient of 5 to 30% sucrose. After centrifuging the tube for 16 h at 4 °C at 190,000 × g in a Hitachi RPS40T-1171 rotor, the fractions were collected from the top of the tube. The total protein in each fraction was determined by Lowry's method (37.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The samples were denatured in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and Western blot was performed as described elsewhere. Heparin Column Chromatography—The cell culture supernatants from HeLa cells transfected with mPA-PLA1 cDNAs were loaded onto a HiTrap heparin column (Amersham Biosciences) using ÄKTA (Amersham Biosciences), and bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (0–1.5 m). For mPA-PLA1α 20 ml of cell culture supernatant was used. For mPA-PLA1β and cont"
https://openalex.org/W1984463832,"Thermoresponsive structures in the 5′-untranslated region of mRNA are known to control translation of heat shock and virulence genes. Expression of many rhizobial heat shock genes is regulated by a conserved sequence element called ROSE for repression of heat shock gene expression. This cis-acting, untranslated mRNA is thought to prevent ribosome access at low temperature through an extended secondary structure, which partially melts when the temperature rises. We show here by a series of in vivo and in vitro approaches that ROSE is a sensitive thermometer responding in the physiologically relevant temperature range between 30 and 40 °C. Point mutations predicted to disrupt base pairing enhanced expression at 30 °C. Compensatory mutations restored repression, emphasizing the importance of secondary structures in the sensory RNA. Only moderate inducibility of a 5′-truncated ROSE variant suggests that interactions between individual stem loops coordinate temperature sensing. In the presence of a complementary oligonucleotide, the functionally important stem loop of ROSE was rendered susceptible to RNase H treatment at heat shock temperatures. Since major structural rearrangements were not observed during UV and CD spectroscopy, subtle structural changes involving the Shine-Dalgarno sequence are proposed to mediate translational control. Temperature perception by the sensory RNA is an ordered process that most likely occurs without the aid of accessory factors.

Hengge-Aronis R. Bacterial Stress Responses. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.2000: 3-18Google Scholar). They operate posttranscriptionally by the formation of secondary structures that mask the ribosome binding site at low temperatures. Elevated temperatures disrupt base pairing and thereby facilitate ribosome entry and translation initiation.In Escherichia coli, the cellular level of the heat shock transcription factor RpoH (σ32) is controlled at different stages of transcription, translation, protein activity, and stability (8Yura T. Kanemori M. Morita M.T. Storz G. Hengge-Aronis R. Bacterial Stress Responses. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.2000: 3-18Google Scholar). Computer predictions, mutational analyses, structure probing techniques, and toeprinting assays established that translation efficiency of the rpoH gene that codes for σ32 is modulated by two cis-acting regions within the 5′-coding sequence of its mRNA, which form an extended secondary structure occluding the ribosome binding site, in a temperature-dependent manner (8Yura T. Kanemori M. Morita M.T. Storz G. Hengge-Aronis R. Bacterial Stress Responses. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.2000: 3-18Google Scholar, 9Morita M.T. Tanaka Y. Kodama T.S. Kyogoku Y. Yanagi H. Yura T.

A close inspection of rpoH sequences from other γ-proteobacteria strongly suggests that translational control of rpoH is conserved among these bacteria (11Nakahigashi K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4383-4390PubMed Google Scholar). Access of ribosomes to the liberated Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence at temperatures above 35 °C also permits translation of the virulence gene activators prfA in Listeria monocytogenes and lcrF in Yersinia pestis (12Johansson J. Mandin P. Renzoni A. Chiaruttini C. Springer M. Cossart P. Cell. 2002; 110: 551-561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 13Hoe N.P. Goguen J.D. J.

Mitta M. Inouye M. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6284-6291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, in contrast to the earlier cases, the secondary structure at low temperature is thought to permit ribosome loading and translation. Another classical example in this category is λ cIII mRNA, which exists in dynamic equilibrium between two alternate conformations (15Altuvia S. Kornitzer D. Teff D. Oppenheim A.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 210: 265-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). At 37 °C, lysogeny is stimulated by production of cIII protein from the free translation initiation region of the mRNA. However, raising the temperature to 45 °C shifts the equilibrium toward the other structure shielding the ribosome binding site, which impedes translation and thereby favors the lytic pathway. In a more complex mode of control, temperature-induced mRNA-mediated activation of translation occurs by pairing of trans-acting elements like the small regulatory DsrA RNA to the leader of the mRNA of the general stress sigma factor RpoS in E. coli (16Repoila F. Gottesman S. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4012-4023Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar).Our knowledge on mRNA-based translational control of heat shock genes derives mainly from two systems, the E. coli rpoH gene and the rhizobial ROSE (repression of heat shock gene expression) element. The expression of multiple small heat shock proteins in Bradyrhizobium japonicum and other rhizobia is controlled by ROSE (17Narberhaus F. Käser R. Nocker A. Hennecke H. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To date, 15 ROSE elements have been described (18Nocker A. Krstulovic N.P. Perret X. Narberhaus F. Arch. Microbiol. 2001; 176: 44-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). All these 70–120-nucleotide-long regulatory elements are located in the 5′-UTR of the heat shock operon in rhizobial species. According to computer predictions, they form extended secondary structures with a highly conserved hairpin covering the SD sequence and AUG start codon. Base pairing in this region is imperfect due to the presence of internal loops and a highly conserved bulged residue. Nucleotide exchanges predicted to disrupt base pairing increased basal expression of the ROSE-lacZ fusions at 30 °C (19Nocker A. Hausherr T. Balsiger S. Krstulovic N.P. Hennecke H. Narberhaus F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4800-4807Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). On the contrary, mutations that improved base pairing further enhanced repression and abolished heat induction. Thus, a delicate balance between paired and unpaired nucleotides is critical to ensure repression at low temperatures and induction at higher temperatures.Here, we set out to address several open questions. We first determined how sensitive the thermosensor is in vivo by measuring the threshold temperature at which expression of ROSE-controlled genes was initiated. Several single and double point mutations were studied, and it was determined whether elevated expression caused by individual point mutations could be reverted to wild-type levels by compensatory mutations. Furthermore, the importance of individual stem loop regions in ROSE was elucidated. Finally and most importantly, we showed by a series of in vitro experiments that the isolated ROSE RNA can open up its conformation in response to temperature without the assistance of cellular components.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—Escherichia coli strains were grown in Luria-Bertani medium at 30 or 37 °C. B. japonicum 110spc4 was propagated aerobically at 30 °C in peptone-salts-yeast extract (PSY) medium (20Regensburger B. Hennecke H. Arch. Microbiol. 1983; 135: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.1% (w/v) arabinose. If appropriate, antibiotics were added in the following concentrations: spectinomycin, 100 μg/ml; chloramphenicol, 30 μg/ml (for counterselection against E. coli donor strains); tetracycline, 10 μg/ml for E. coli strains and 50 μg/ml for B. japonicum strains.Plasmid and Strain Constructions—Standard protocols were used for recombinant DNA technology (21Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York2001Google Scholar). All plasmids were constructed in E. coli DH5α. Point mutations in ROSE1 and the Δ1–67 deletion to obtain Mini-ROSE constructs (ROSE1 constructs consisting of stem loop IV only) were introduced by mutagenic oligonucleotides using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with the pUC18-derived plasmid pRJ5064 as a template. It carries a 718-bp PstI fragment containing ROSE1 flanked by a 264-bp upstream sequence and 352 bp of the 5′-end of hspA (17Narberhaus F. Käser R. Nocker A. Hennecke H. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). For ROSE variants with two nucleotide exchanges, appropriate plasmids with single point mutations were selected for a second round of mutagenesis. The sequences of mutated ROSE elements were confirmed by automated sequencing.Mutated inserts were isolated after restriction with PstI or PstI and SmaI (depending on the exact history of the plasmid) and transferred upstream of the lacZ gene in the vector pSUP482 (22Minder A.C. Fischer H.M. Hennecke H. Narberhaus F. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 14-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), which had been digested with the same enzymes. For integration into the B. japonicum chromosome, plasmids were conjugated from E. coli S17-1. Correct genomic integration was confirmed by colony PCR and automated sequencing of the product.β-Galactosidase Assay—Duplicate cultures of E. coli and B. japonicum were grown at the temperatures indicated to a cell density of ∼0.5 at A600. β-Galactosidase assays were performed as described previously (23Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1972Google Scholar).In Vitro Transcription—PCR products containing the T7 promoter followed by the wild-type or mutated ROSE sequence were generated from corresponding plasmids. RNA was transcribed from the PCR templates with T7 RNA polymerase in a reaction mixture containing transcription buffer: 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9 at 25 °C), 6 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm NaCl, and 2 mm spermidine; 4 mm ribonucleoside triphosphates and RNase inhibitor. The reaction was incubated for 3 h at 37 °C, and RNA was precipitated with salt and ethanol.In vitro experiments were routinely performed with RNA redissolved in cacodylate buffer containing 50 mm sodium cacodylate, 50 mm KCl, and 10 mm MgCl2. Some CD experiments were carried out in the same buffer containing 1 mm MgCl2 or in water.Spectroscopic Studies—UV spectroscopy was carried out with Hewlett Packard 8452A diode array spectrophotometer containing a Peltier device. Temperature was raised at 1 °C/min. The cuvette was incubated for 5 min at the temperature at which the A260 was measured to attain the specified temperature. A wavelength scan from 220 to 320 nm was recorded for each temperature.For CD measurements, RNA was quantified by UV absorbance at 260 nm and used at a concentration of 0.7 μg/ml. A wavelength scan from 200 to 320 nm was done in a Bio-Kine 32 scanning spectrophotometer MS450 with an acquisition of 10 s. The desired temperature was maintained with the cuvette chamber being connected to a water bath provided within the instrumental setup. The CD spectra at different temperatures were found to be reproducible for several experiments.RNaseH Treatment—[α-32P]CTP-labeled transcripts of ROSE were incubated with the oligonucleotides A (5′-GCCGGGCCCCTAGGGCGCC-3′), B (5′-CCTCCGGCGCCCGTCTCCGCCGGG-3′), C (5′-GTCCTCATAGCCAAATCCTCC-3′), or D (5′-GATAGTTGATCGCCACAGGGGGCTGATG-3′) at the specified temperatures for 10 min in cacodylate buffer. 0.5 units of RNaseH were added to the reaction mixture followed by a further incubation of 5 min. The products were then loaded on 8% denaturing PAGE containing 8 m urea. Transcripts of known size were run as size standards. The experiment with the mutants of ROSE was slightly modified by annealing the oligonucleotide at the specified temperature. All reactions were then incubated with RNaseH at 20 °C to maintain uniformity of the enzymatic action.RESULTSTemperature-responsiveness of ROSE-type Thermosensors in Vivo—To assess temperature control of ROSE-regulated genes, we chose two translational lacZ fusions, namely B. japonicum ROSE1-hspA-lacZ and Bradyrhizobium sp. (Parasponia) ROSEP3-hspD-lacZ. Both ROSE sequences have been shown to be functionally interchangeable repressor elements in rhizobia (18Nocker A. Krstulovic N.P. Perret X. Narberhaus F. Arch. Microbiol. 2001; 176: 44-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In the present study, expression of the plasmid-borne fusions was measured in E. coli. Thermally controlled expression cannot be monitored under steady-state conditions in the homologous backgrounds because most rhizobia are unable to grow at temperatures higher than 34 °C. However, they survive a prolonged heat shock even at 42 °C (24Narberhaus F. Weiglhofer W. Fischer H.M. Hennecke H. Arch. Microbiol. 1998; 169: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). As one protective measure, ROSE-controlled heat shock proteins are strongly induced at non-permissive growth temperatures ranging from 37 to 42 °C in B. japonicum (25Münchbach M. Nocker A. Narberhaus F. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 83-90Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). From previous studies, we know that thermoregulation by ROSE can be simulated in E. coli (19Nocker A. Hausherr T. Balsiger S. Krstulovic N.P. Hennecke H. Narberhaus F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4800-4807Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) (see also Figs. 3 and 4).Fig. 4Expression of Mini-ROSE1-hspA-lacZ fusions. Mini-ROSE fusions lack nucleotides 1–67 of ROSE1 (Fig. 2). Expression was measured as indicated in the legend for Fig. 3. WT, wild type. MU, Miller units.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)As in rhizobial backgrounds (18Nocker A. Krstulovic N.P. Perret X. Narberhaus F. Arch. Microbiol. 2001; 176: 44-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), both lacZ fusions showed different basal expression levels in E. coli. The ROSE1 fusion produced a very low β-galactosidase activity of ∼0.2 Miller units at 25 °C, whereas the ROSEP3 fusion generated 24.4 megaunits. Despite this initial difference, both fusions exhibited a very similar temperature response (Fig. 1). Induction started around 33 °C and led to ∼10- and 35-fold elevated expression levels at 35 and 37 °C, respectively. As a control, we used a B. japonicum rpoN2-lacZ fusion (26Kullik I. Fritsche S. Knobel H. Sanjuan J. Hennecke H. Fischer H.M. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 1125-1138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which was expected not to be thermally controlled. Starting from 59 megaunits at 25 °C, β-galactosidase activity indeed increased only slightly with increasing temperatures.Fig. 1Temperature responsiveness of translational ROSE-lacZ fusions from two different Bradyrhizobium strains.E. coli cultures carrying plasmids with the corresponding lacZ fusions were grown overnight at 30 °C, diluted, and grown at the indicated temperatures for ∼3 h before β-galactosidase activity was measured. A B. japonicum rpoN2-lacZ fusion served as not temperature-regulated control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Derepression by Point Mutations in ROSE—Previous mutational studies revealed a number of point mutations in ROSE1 that altered its regulatory properties (19Nocker A. Hausherr T. Balsiger S. Krstulovic N.P. Hennecke H. Narberhaus F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4800-4807Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Two additional single exchange variants, U70A and A78U, were constructed and assayed in comparison with the existing U98A and A106U mutations (Fig. 2). All four mutations are predicted to reduce the free energy of the ultimate hairpin of ROSE1 without directly interfering with base pairing of the SD sequence and translational start codon. Expression of translational lacZ fusions on pSUP482-derived plasmids in E. coli or of chromosomally integrated fusions in B. japonicum was determined. The point mutations partially relieved ROSE-mediated repression at 30 °C in both backgrounds, reinforcing the idea that correct stem loop formation is critical for regulation (Fig. 3, A and B). Although significantly derepressed at 30 °C, expression of point-mutated ROSE variants was further enhanced at 37 °C. The introduction of two simultaneous mismatches in ROSE (U70A, U98A and A78U, A106U) resulted in massive expression at 30 °C (Fig. 3, A and B). Some additional stimulation was observed when the E. coli cultures were grown at 37 °C (Fig. 3A).Fig. 2Computer-predicted secondary structure of ROSE1.Top, schematic representation of the ROSE1-regulated hspArpoH1 operon (17Narberhaus F. Käser R. Nocker A. Hennecke H. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 36Narberhaus F. Weiglhofer W. Fischer H.M. Hennecke H. J.

Bottom, blowup of the ultimate hairpin masking the ribosome binding region. The SD sequence and translational start codon are highlighted in gray. Nucleotide exchanges relevant for this study are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Compensatory Mutations Restore Repression—If base pairing rather than the exact nucleotide sequence was important for regulation, double mutations introducing a complementary nucleotide opposite to an unpaired point mutation should restore wild-type properties. This prediction was tested by construction of the A78U, U98A and A106U, U70A mutants (Fig. 2). In fact, E. coli or B. japonicum strains carrying these complementary mutations fully regained repression at 30 °C (Fig. 3, A and B), pointing out that base pairing is the major determinant for ROSE-mediated repression.Importance of Stem Loops I–III for Thermosensing—A length of around 100 nucleotides and the complex structure of all known ROSE elements raise the question of whether the predicted stem loop structures at the 5′-end are functionally important. A Mini-ROSE construct was compared with the full-length version. Expression of corresponding hspA-lacZ fusions in E. coli or B. japonicum showed that the Mini-ROSE variant was capable of repression at 30 °C (Fig. 4, A and B). Interestingly, heat induction in E. coli was less pronounced than in the full-length context (Fig. 4A). Introduction of nucleotide exchanges equivalent to U98A or A106U into Mini-ROSE led to enhanced expression at 30 °C in E. coli and B. japonicum (Fig. 4, A and B). The overall expression levels in E. coli at 30 and 37 °C were ∼10 times lower than in the full-length mutants (compare with Fig. 3A). These results clearly show that Mini-ROSE consisting of stem loop region IV is a functional repressor element. However, temperature responsiveness appears less efficient in the absence of region I–III.Subtle Temperature-mediated Alterations in the RNA Thermometer—To further investigate the thermal response of ROSE, we performed several in vitro experiments. ROSE-containing transcripts were synthesized in vitro from corresponding PCR-generated templates carrying the T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence. Thermally induced structural changes in the wild-type ROSE RNA were recorded by UV spectroscopy. Only a moderate, gradual increase in A260 values was observed with the increase in temperature from 20 to 60 °C (Fig. 5). Hyperchromicity was reversible with decreasing temperature. The mild transition between 35 and 40 °C might be indicative of local melting in a subregion of ROSE.Fig. 5Structural changes of ROSE RNA shown by UV spectroscopy.A260 values of wild-type ROSE were plotted against temperature. The RNA preparation was first treated up to 60 °C and then cooled down again.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Melting studies were also carried out by CD spectroscopy. Fig. 6A shows the profile of a wavelength scan for wild-type ROSE from 200 to 320 nm with increasing temperature from 25 to 80 °C. The decrease in peak intensities around 270 nm and a peak shift toward 275 nm with rising temperatures indicates loss of base stacking interactions in the RNA molecule. Again, drastic melting of the structure was not observed in the physiologically relevant temperature range. When the maxima around 270 nm were plotted against temperature, it became evident that subtle structural changes progressed gradually up to a temperature of 60 °C with a very mild transition around 35–40 °C (Fig. 6, B and D). Complete melting resulting in the loss of base stacking (between 270 and 290 nm) and large conformational changes (between 240 and 260 nm) was evident at 80 °C (Fig. 6A, dark red line). The study was further extended with the G83Δ and U98A mutants of ROSE and with the wild-type Mini-ROSE fragment. From the wavelength profiles, the highest peak intensity obtained at a particular temperature around 270 nm was plotted against that temperature in Fig. 6B. It appears that the G83Δ RNA is more resistant to a temperature increase up to about 50 °C than the wild-type species, agreeing well with its predicted higher conformational stability. On the contrary, the height of the peaks from RNA of the derepressed U98A mutant dropped more steadily with increasing temperature, suggesting a looser structure. Only meager changes in peak intensities with increasing temperature were registered for the Mini-ROSE RNA lacking stem loops I, II, and III. Consistent with the in vivo data, this reflects that it is not as effective a thermosensor as the full-length structure.Fig. 6Thermal response of ROSE RNAs demonstrated by CD spectroscopy. In A, wild-type ROSE RNA in cacodylate buffer containing 10 mm MgCl2 was subjected to a wavelength scan from 200 to 320 nm. Measurements were taken at 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 60, 70, and 80 °C. The traces recorded with increasing temperatures are color-coded from dark blue (25 °C) over yellow (45 °C) to dark red (80 °C). The decreasing peak intensity around 275 nm with increasing temperature is indicated by a downward arrow. The shift of the profile in the opposite direction in the range of 240–260 nm is indicated by the upward arrow. In B, peak maxima (in millidegrees, derived from A) of ROSE and its variants around 275 nm were plotted against temperature. C, comparison of structural changes in ROSE wild-type RNA under different buffer conditions. The maxima around 275 nm were plotted against temperature as in B. In D, temperature profiles of ROSE variants were recorded in water and plotted as above. E, reversible structural changes of wild-type ROSE RNA (in cacodylate buffer with 10 mm MgCl2) at temperatures between 25 and 50 °C. The temperature was first increased up to 50 °C before the RNA sample was cooled down again.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Since RNA conformation may be influenced by divalent cations and overall ionic strength, we carried out similar CD experiments with wild-type ROSE RNA dissolved in water or in cacodylate buffer containing high or low magnesium concentrations. The traces recorded under all three conditions were superimposable (Fig. 6C). In accordance with the measurements at high magnesium concentrations, a comparative analysis in water showed that the G83Δ RNA was more stable up to 45 °C and that the U98 RNA was more labile at 30 °C than the wild-type RNA (Fig. 6D). As in the UV experiment, structural changes in the RNA were reversible between 25 and 50 °C (Fig. 6E). When shifted beyond 70 °C, the ROSE RNA was unable to restore its conformation upon cooling (data not shown).RNaseH Protection Experiments Reveal Temperature-controlled Base Pairing—In yet another approach, the accessibility of the individual stem loops to complementary DNA oligonucleotide was assessed at different temperatures. Oligonucleotides A, B, and C were targeted against stem loops II, III, and IV, respectively (Fig. 2). Oligonucleotide D is complementary to the coding sequence of the hspA gene 11 nucleotides downstream of the translation start codon. Hydrogen bonding between the synthetic RNA and the complementary oligonucleotides is assumed to be possible only in unpaired RNA stretches. As a consequence, the resulting DNA-RNA hybrids will become a substrate for RNaseH, which will cleave the transcript into smaller products.Fig. 7A shows full-length ROSE RNA in lane 1. Cleavage by RNaseH in the presence of oligonucleotide A was obtained at 30 and 42 °C. With oligonucleotide B, RNaseH cleavage started even as low as 0 °C followed by enhanced cleavage at higher temperatures. Interestingly, prominent protection of region IV against RNaseH attack was observed with oligonucleotide C at 20 and 30 °C (Fig. 7B), whereas strong cleavage was obtained at 42 °C. As one might expect, the region downstream of ROSE was accessible to oligonucleotide D and hence processed by RNaseH already at 0 and 30 °C.Fig. 7Antisense-oligonucleotide (oligo) induced RNaseH cleavage. RNaseH-treated products were run on 8% denaturing PAGE. Lane 1 in A shows untreated full-length wild-type ROSE RNA as a control. Lanes 2–4 show RNaseH-treated ROSE RNA in the presence of oligonucleotide A at 0, 30, and 42 °C, respectively. The expected products are 188 and 17 nucleotides. The smaller product is not visible. Lanes 5–7 show RNaseH-digested products in the presence of oligonucleotide B. The products are 169 and 31 nucleotides. Again, the smaller fragment is not visible. In B, RnaseH products of ROSE RNA obtained at 0, 30, and 42 °C in presence of oligonucleotide C and oligonucleotide D are shown. The respective cleavage products are indicated.View Large Image"

The activated form of Claspin contains two repeated phosphopeptide motifs that mediate its binding to Chk1. We show that these phosphopeptide motifs bind to Chk1 by means of its N-terminal kinase domain. The binding site on Chk1 involves a positively charged cluster of amino acids that contains lysine 54, arginine 129, threonine 153, and arginine 162. Mutagenesis of these residues strongly compromises the ability of Chk1 to interact with Claspin. These amino acids lie within regions of Chk1 that are involved in various aspects of its catalytic function. The predicted position on Chk1 of the phosphate group from Claspin corresponds to the location of activation-loop phosphorylation in various kinases. In addition, we have obtained evidence that the C-terminal regulatory domain of Chk1, which does not form a stable complex with Claspin under our assay conditions, nonetheless has some role in Claspin-dependent activation. Overall, these results indicate that Claspin docks with a phosphate-binding site in the catalytic domain of Chk1 during activation by ATR.

For example, cells prevent the initiation of mitosis if DNA replication has not occurred normally. In vertebrates, this control system, which is known as the DNA replication checkpoint, employs the effector kinase Chk1 to suppress activation of the Cdc2-cyclin B complex, a critical regulator of the G2/M transition (3Morgan D.O.

Cell. 2000; 6: 839-849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). The activation of Xchk1 requires phosphorylation on conserved Ser-Gln/Thr-Gln (SQ/TQ) motifs in its C-terminal domain by the Xenopus homologue of ATR (Xatr) (4Guo Z. Kumagai A. Wang S.X. Dunphy W.G.

Dunphy W.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 839-849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Homologues of Claspin called Mrc1 were identified subsequently in budding and fission yeast as regulators of the checkpoint effector kinases Rad53 and Cds1, respectively (10Alcasabas A.A. Osborn A.J. Bachant J. Hu F. Werler P.J. Bousset K. Furuya K. Diffley J.F. Carr A.M. Elledge S.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 958-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 11Tanaka K. Russell P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 966-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Likewise, Claspin shares functional properties with budding yeast Rad9 and fission yeast Crb2, which control the activation of Rad53 and Chk1, respectively (1Melo J. Toczyski D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Claspin is also found in human cells, where it likewise functions as a critical component of the DNA replication checkpoint (9Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 839-849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 12Chini C.C. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30057-30062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In recent studies, it was shown that Claspin interacts with chromatin in a highly regulated manner during S-phase (13Lee J. Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 329-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The chromatin binding properties of Claspin suggest that it acts as a checkpoint sensor protein that detects the presence of active DNA replication complexes in the nuclei of vertebrate cells (13Lee J. Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 329-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Mrc1 may fulfill a similar function in the yeast systems (14Osborn A.J. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1755-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar).In previous structure-function studies, we identified properties of Claspin that allow it to interact with Xchk1 (15Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Claspin contains a 57-amino acid segment, the Chk1-binding domain (CKBD), which is both necessary and sufficient for this interaction. The CKBD contains two repeated Chk1-binding (CKB) motifs that are approximately 10 amino acids in length. A serine residue in the center of each motif (Ser-864 and Ser-895) undergoes phosphorylation during a DNA replication checkpoint response. Phosphorylation of both Ser-864 and Ser-895 is necessary for efficient binding of Claspin to Xchk1, and this phosphorylation-dependent binding is essential for the activation of Xchk1 by Xatr. On the basis of these observations, we surmised that Xchk1 might contain a phosphate-binding site that would allow it to dock with Claspin. In this report, we have investigated the molecular features of Xchk1 that mediate its interaction with Claspin.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProduction of Recombinant Xchk1 Proteins—A version of pFastBac encoding Xchk1 with GST and His6 tags at the C-terminal end (Xchk1-GH) was described previously (9Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 839-849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). To prepare the various truncation mutants of Xchk1-GH that are described in this study, the RsrII-SpeI fragment of pFastBac-Xchk1-GH was removed by digestion with RsrII and SpeI. DNA fragments encoding the desired sections of Xchk1 were amplified by PCR with the appropriate primers containing RsrII or SpeI sites. These fragments were ligated back into the digested pFastBac-Xchk1-GH vector. The N135A and 4AQ point mutants of Xchk1-GH were described before (9Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 839-849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). The T377A and 4AQ/T377A mutants of Xchk1-GH were produced by swapping the appropriate DNA fragments from pFastBacHTa-Xchk1-T377A and pFastBacHTa-Xchk1–4AQ/T377A (16Wang S.X. Dunphy W.G. FEBS Lett. 2000; 487: 277-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) into pFastBac-Xchk1-GH. The K53A, K54A, R129A, T153A, and R162A point mutants of Xchk1-GH were produced with the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). Recombinant baculoviruses were produced with the Bac-to-Bac system (Invitrogen). Recombinant proteins were expressed in Sf9 insect cells and purified as described previously (9Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 839-849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). A 35S-labeled fragment of Xchk1 containing amino acids 266–474 as well as Met and Ala at the N terminus was produced by using the TnT T7 Quick for PCR DNA kit (Promega) as described previously (15Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). For this procedure, the 5′ primer contained a T7 promoter sequence.Preparation of Maltose-binding Protein (MBP)-CKBD—A DNA fragment encoding amino acids 838–920 of Claspin, which contains the CKBD, was amplified by PCR and cloned into pMAL (New England Biolabs) that had been digested with SalI and HindIII. MBP-CKBD was expressed in Codon-Plus (RIL) Escherichia coli cells, isolated with amylose resin (New England Biolabs), and eluted with HEPES-buffered saline containing 20 mm maltose.Assay for Binding of Claspin to Xchk1 and Its Fragments—In one type of assay, recombinant Xchk1-GH and various mutants (1 μg) bound to nickel-agarose beads were added to 100 μl of Xenopus egg interphase extract containing 100 μg/ml cycloheximide, 3 μm okadaic acid, and 50 μg/ml of an annealed mixture consisting of poly(dA)70 and poly(dT)70, as indicated. The extracts were incubated for 100 min at room temperature under constant agitation. After the incubation, the beads were isolated by centrifugation and washed five times with buffer A (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EGTA, 20 mm β-glycerol phosphate, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40). Alternatively, soluble Xchk1-GH and various mutants (1 μg) were incubated in egg extracts under the same conditions. Following the incubation, the extracts were diluted with 200 μl of buffer A and centrifuged through a 1-ml Sephadex G-25 column. The eluate was incubated with 10 μl of glutathione-agarose for 30 min at 4 °C. The beads were collected and washed three times with buffer A. Finally, all samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE.Miscellaneous—35S-Labeled wild-type Claspin and Claspin-2AG were produced with the TnT in vitro transcription/translation system (Promega) as described (15Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Kinase assays for the activity of Xchk1 were performed with a GST-Cdc25C peptide as substrate as described previously (8Kumagai A. Guo Z. Emami K.H. Wang S.X. Dunphy W.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1559-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting with antibodies against Claspin, GST, and Ser(P)-344 of Xchk1 was described earlier (9Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 839-849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 13Lee J. Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 329-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Anti-MBP antibodies were purchased from New England Biolabs.RESULTSClaspin Interacts with the N-terminal Kinase Domain of Xchk1—In previous studies, we demonstrated that Claspin binds to a recombinant form of Xchk1 (Xchk1-GH) in Xenopus egg extracts containing an annealed mixture of poly(dA)70 and poly(dT)70 (hereafter called pA-pT) and a phosphatase inhibitor such as tautomycin (9Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 839-849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Subsequently, we have found that okadaic acid is comparably effective to tautomycin. We have used this assay to investigate what region of Xchk1 is necessary for binding to Claspin. Initially, we prepared various C-terminal truncations of Xchk1 (Fig. 1, A and B). We observed that truncations containing amino acids 1–409 and 1–373 of Xchk1 showed reduced binding to Claspin in comparison with full-length Xchk1 (residues 1–474). A more severe truncation containing amino acids 1–311 consistently bound to Claspin somewhat more efficiently than the 1–409 and 1–373 fragments. A further shortening of the 1–311 fragment to yield the minimal kinase domain (residues 1–265) resulted in diminished binding. Nonetheless, we found that the 1–265 fragment of Xchk1 bound well to Claspin under various assay conditions. As a control, we showed that a His6-GST fusion protein alone could not bind to Claspin under these conditions. These experiments indicate that Claspin clearly interacts with the kinase domain of Xchk1 (residues 1–265). Nonetheless, removal of all or part of the C-terminal regulatory domain of Xchk1 (residues 266–474) reduces the binding of Claspin.Next, we sought to identify the location in the kinase domain that interacts with Claspin (Fig. 1, C and D). As one approach, we prepared a variety of C- and N-terminal truncations of the kinase domain (residues 1–265). In these experiments, we were unable to identify any fragment of Xchk1 smaller than the minimal kinase domain that could interact detectably with Claspin (Fig. 1, C and D). These results indicate that Xchk1 most probably must possess an intact and properly folded kinase domain to associate with Claspin.Interaction of Claspin with the Kinase Domain of Xchk1 Involves the CKBD—In parallel, we asked whether the binding of Claspin to the kinase domain of Xchk1 involves the mechanism that we previously identified for interaction with full-length Xchk1. We first examined whether a polypeptide containing the CKBD from Claspin could bind to the kinase domain of Xchk1 (Fig. 2A). For this experiment, we prepared a fusion protein that contains the MBP and residues 838–920 of Claspin. We incubated the MBP-CKBD in egg extracts containing full-length Xchk1-GH, Xchk1-(1–311)-GH, or Xchk1-(1–265)-GH. We observed that all three Xchk1 polypeptides bound to the MBP-CKBD with relative efficiencies that were comparable with what we had observed for binding to full-length Claspin. In a control incubation, MBP alone did not interact with Xchk1 in this assay. We also asked whether the binding of Claspin to the kinase domain of Xchk1 requires phosphorylation on Ser-864 and Ser-895 of Claspin. For this purpose, we incubated 35S-labeled versions of full-length, wild-type Claspin or the Claspin-2AG mutant (which contains alanine at positions 864 and 895) in egg extracts with full-length Xchk1-GH, Xchk1-(1–265)-GH, or Xchk1-(266–474)-GH in the presence of pA-pT. As shown in Fig. 2B, full-length Xchk1 and the 1–265 fragment bound to wild-type Claspin but not to the Claspin-2AG mutant. There was no detectable binding of the 266–474 fragment of Xchk1 to either form of Claspin. Taken together, these results indicate that the kinase domain of Xchk1 binds to the CKBD of Claspin in a manner that requires phosphorylation on Ser-864 and Ser-895.Fig. 2Binding of Claspin to the kinase domain of Xchk1 involves the CKBD and requires phosphorylation of Claspin on Ser-864 and Ser-895.A, MBP-CKBD (lanes 1–5) and MBP alone (lane 6) were incubated in egg extracts containing full-length (FL) Xchk1-GH and the indicated fragments of Xchk1 in the presence of pA-pT and okadaic acid.

The crystal structure of residues 1–289 from human Chk1 has been solved to atomic resolution (17Chen P. Luo C. Deng Y. Ryan K. Register J. Margosiak S. Tempczyk-Russell A. Nguyen B. Myers P. Lundgren K. Kan C.C. O'Connor P.M. Cell. 2000; 100: 681-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). A notable feature of this structure is that it contains a sulfate ion near the catalytic center of Chk1. There are numerous examples in which sulfate ions mimic phosphate groups and associate with phosphate-binding sites in proteins during crystallization procedures (17Chen P. Luo C. Deng Y. Ryan K. Register J. Margosiak S. Tempczyk-Russell A. Nguyen B. Myers P. Lundgren K. Kan C.C. O'Connor P.M. Cell. 2000; 100: 681-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In the case of human Chk1, the sulfate ion resides in a positively charged cluster of amino acids that contains Lys-54, Arg-129, Thr-153, and Arg-162 (17Chen P. Luo C. Deng Y. Ryan K. Register J.

B, wild-type Xchk1-GH and various mutant forms of Xchk1 with the indicated alterations in its kinase domain were incubated in egg extracts in the absence (lanes 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13) or presence (lanes 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14) of pA-pT. All samples contained okadaic acid. The tagged Xchk1 proteins were reisolated. In some cases, the samples were processed for immunoblotting with antibodies against Claspin (top panel), GST (second panel from top), and Ser(P)-344 of Xchk1 (third panel from top). For the bottom panel, the various reisolated Xchk1 proteins were assayed for kinase activity toward a GST-Cdc25C peptide. The samples were subjected to gel electrophoresis, and 32P incorporation was detected with a PhosphorImager.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 4Illustration of the putative phosphate-binding site in Chk1.A, ribbon diagram of residues 1–289 from human Chk1.

This position corresponds to that of the sulfate group in the crystal structure of human Chk1-(1–289) (17Chen P. Luo C. Deng Y. Ryan K. Register J. Margosiak S. Tempczyk-Russell A. Nguyen B. Myers P.

Distances are indicated in angstroms.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)For illustration, we have diagramed how these residues could interact with a phosphate group (see Fig. 4). Interestingly, these amino acids all sit in regions of Chk1 that are generally important for various aspects of catalytic function in a wide variety of kinases (18Johnson L.N. Noble M.E. Owen D.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar, 19Huse M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2002; 109: 275-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1344) Google Scholar). For example, Arg-129 precedes Asp-130, which is a highly invariant residue in the catalytic loop of protein kinases (Fig. 3A). The corresponding amino acid in the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (cAPK) is Asp-166. This residue acts as the base that removes a proton from the hydroxyl group of the protein kinase substrate. Thr-153 and Arg-162 lie in a section of Chk1 that corresponds to the activation loop in various kinases. In the cases of cAPK and Cdk2, for example, this loop undergoes a phosphorylation that helps to position the critical aspartate residue in the catalytic loop. Finally, Lys-54 precedes Glu-55 in the αC helix of Chk1. The equivalent glutamic acid in the αC helix of cAPK is Glu-91, which forms a ion pair with Lys-72 and thereby helps to stabilize interactions between Lys-72 and the α and β phosphates of ATP. Significantly, the position of the sulfate ion in the crystal structure of human Chk1 corresponds to the location of the activating phosphorylation in cAPK and Cdk2 (18Johnson L.N. Noble M.E. Owen D.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar, 20Morgan D.O. De Bondt H.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Paradoxically, however, Chk1 appears not to undergo this type of activating phosphorylation on its polypeptide chain (17Chen P. Luo C. Deng Y. Ryan K. Register J. Margosiak S. Tempczyk-Russell A. Nguyen B. Myers P. Lundgren K. Kan C.C. O'Connor P.M. Cell. 2000; 100: 681-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar).We mutated Lys-54, Arg-129, Thr-153, and Arg-162 individually to alanine in the full-length Xchk1-GH protein. We observed that none of the K54A, R129A, T153A, or R162A mutants could associate stably with Claspin under the conditions of our binding assay (Fig. 3B). For comparison, we mutated Lys-53, which is a positively charged residue that lies immediately adjacent to Lys-54, but does not face the putative phosphate-binding site. We found that the K53A mutant of Xchk1 binds very well to Claspin. We also investigated the Claspin binding properties of a previously characterized kinase-inactive mutant of Xchk1 (N135A) in which Asn-135 has been changed to alanine (9Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 839-849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Although Asn-135 also resides in the catalytic center of Chk1, we observed that the N135A mutant interacts efficiently with Claspin.To pursue these observations further, we asked whether mutants of Xchk1 with alterations in the putative phosphate-binding site could undergo Xatr-mediated phosphorylation and activation (Fig. 3B). For this analysis, we examined the phosphorylation of Ser-344 on Xchk1 in the absence and presence of pA-pT. Ser-344 is a major site on Xchk1 for phosphorylation by Xatr (4Guo Z. Kumagai A. Wang S.X. Dunphy W.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2745-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). We also assayed the kinase activity of Xchk1 toward a GST-Cdc25C peptide (8Kumagai A. Guo Z. Emami K.H. Wang S.X. Dunphy W.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1559-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In the case of the R129A and T153A mutants, we observed that the checkpoint-dependent phosphorylation of Xchk1 on Ser-344 was almost completely abolished. The R129A mutant displays negligible kinase activity in both the absence and presence of pA-pT. The T153A mutant possesses a basal kinase activity similar to that of wild-type Xchk1. However, the T153A mutant, in contrast to wild-type Xchk1, does not undergo an increase in activity in response to pA-pT.In the case of the K54A mutant, there was reduced but detectable phosphorylation on Ser-344. Likewise, activation of the K54A mutant in the presence of pA-pT was diminished substantially but not abolished. Finally, the R162A mutant underwent significant phosphorylation on Ser-344, but this protein did not undergo any increase in activity in the presence of pA-pT. Thus, for the R162A mutant, there appears to be an uncoupling between phosphorylation on Ser-344 and elevated kinase activity. Although we could not detect binding of the K54A and R162A mutants to Claspin, these mutants may still be capable of interacting transiently with Claspin. Perhaps this transient binding would be sufficient to enable some phosphorylation of Xchk1 by Xatr. Overall, these experiments indicate that residues in the phosphate-binding site of Xchk1, especially Arg-129 and Thr-153, are important for the Claspin-dependent activation of Xchk1.The C-terminal Regulatory Domain of Xchk1 Requires Claspin for Its Phosphorylation—Although Claspin binds to the N-terminal kinase domain of Xchk1, the C-terminal domain of Xchk1 also appears to have some role in regulating the interaction with Claspin. For example, removal of all or part of the C-terminal regulatory domain from Xchk1 significantly diminishes binding to Claspin (Fig. 1B). This observation raises the possibility that the C-terminal domain of Xchk1 might contain a second binding site for Claspin or might contribute to the Claspin-binding site in the N-terminal kinase domain. However, we have not been able to observe stable binding of Claspin to the isolated C-terminal domain of Xchk1 (see Fig. 1B). To investigate this issue further, we examined the checkpoint-dependent phosphorylation of the C-terminal regulatory domain of Xchk1 in the presence and absence of Claspin (Fig. 5). Consistent with previous results (21Michael W.M. Ott R. Fanning E. Newport J. Science. 2000; 289: 2133-2137Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), we observed that a 35S-labeled fragment of Xchk1 containing its C-terminal regulatory domain (amino acids 266–474) underwent phosphorylation in the presence of pA-pT and okadaic acid. Significantly, this phosphorylation was abolished in extracts from which Claspin had been removed by immunodepletion. Furthermore, the checkpoint-dependent phosphorylation of the Xchk1-(266–474) fragment could be restored by the addition of recombinant His6-Claspin to the Claspin-depleted extracts. The phosphorylation of the Xchk1-(266–474) fragment still occurred in extracts from which the endogenous full-length Xchk1 protein had been immunodepleted (not shown). Therefore, the phosphorylation of the Xchk1-(266–474) fragment cannot be facilitated by association with endogenous full-length Xchk1. Overall, these observations suggest that Claspin also may associate transiently with the C-terminal regulatory domain of Xchk1.Fig. 5The C-terminal regulatory domain of Xchk1 depends upon Claspin for its phosphorylation.A, immunodepletion of Claspin.

Dual targeting of cytochrome P4502B1 by two targeting signals to the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria is controlled by phosphorylation of the protein, which activates its mitochondrial targeting signal and functionally inhibits its ER 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; Aky2, adenylate kinase; MPP, mitochondrial matrix peptidase; CCCP, carbonyl cyanide p-chlorophenylhydrazone; TE buffer, 10 mM Tris/1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser-desorption time-of-flight; PK, proteinase K; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; hsp70, 70,000-Da heat-shock protein; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; QTOF, quantitative time-of-flight; MS, mass spectrometry.1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; Aky2, adenylate kinase; MPP, mitochondrial matrix peptidase; CCCP, carbonyl cyanide p-chlorophenylhydrazone; TE buffer, 10 mM Tris/1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser-desorption time-of-flight; PK, proteinase K; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; hsp70, 70,000-Da heat-shock protein; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; QTOF, quantitative time-of-flight; MS, mass spectrometry. targeting signal (3Anandatheerthavarada H.K.

The NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase (Mcr1p) is sorted to the outer mitochondrial membrane or the mitochondrial intermembrane space in yeast because of what seems to be an incomplete translocation through the outer membrane. More recently, Bandlow and co-workers (5Strobel G. Zollner A. Angermayr M. Bandlow W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1439-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) have suggested that competition between spontaneous protein folding and mitochondrial targeting determines the distribution of the yeast major adenylate kinase (Aky2). Their model proposes that Aky2 is imported into mitochondria before commencement of significant tertiary structure formation, yet once folded in the cytosol, it is in an enzymatically active state and not competent for import. In plant cells, there are cases in which a protein is targeted by means of a single targeting presequence to both mitochondria and chloroplasts. Such signal sequences are called “ambiguous” even though different regions of the targeting sequence may be recognized by the different organelles (7Peeters N. Small I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1541: 54-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Cytosolic and mitochondrial fumarase isoenzymes are encoded by the same gene (FUM1) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (8Wu M. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12275-12282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously shown that these proteins follow a unique mechanism of subcellular localization and distribution. There is only one translation product of FUM1 that is targeted to mitochondria by an N-terminal presequence, which is then removed by the mitochondrial matrix peptidase (MPP) (1Stein I. Peleg Y. Even-Ram S. Pines O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4770-4778Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The working model proposes that a subset of the processed fumarase molecules is fully imported into the matrix, whereas the majority (∼70%) is partially translocated, so that their amino termini become accessible to MPP. These latter molecules are released back into the cytosol as soluble enzyme by retrograde movement through the translocation pore (9Knox C. Sass E. Neupert W. Pines O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25587-25593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Another unique feature of fumarase is that both in vivo and in vitro, its translocation into the mitochondrial matrix occurs only while it is being translated (1Stein I. Peleg Y. Even-Ram S. Pines O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4770-4778Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 9Knox C. Sass E. Neupert W. Pines O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25587-25593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that although a mitochondrial targeting sequence is required for interaction of the protein with mitochondria, the specific fumarase targeting signal and the immediate sequence downstream are not crucial for the dual distribution phenomenon. In this study, we have isolated fumarase mutants in which dual targeting is abolished because of perturbation of its conformation. We show that the two isoenzymes are identical and that their distribution can be affected by hsp70 molecular chaperones. These results support the notion that fumarase distribution is determined by its folding in the cell. Strains and Plasmids—The S. cerevisiae strains used were DMM1–15A (leu2, ura3, ade2, his5) (1Stein I. Peleg Y. Even-Ram S. Pines O. Mol. Cell.

Strains harboring the appropriate plasmids were grown overnight at 30 °C in synthetic depleted medium containing 0.67% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (Difco) and 2% glucose or galactose (w/v) supplemented with the appropriate amino acids (50 μg/ml). Plasmids pFT2 (Fum-WT) and pFSE24 (ΔSP) are described elsewhere (1Stein I. Peleg Y. Even-Ram S. Pines O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4770-4778Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 14Sass E. Blachinsky E. Karniely S. Pines O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46111-46117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Plasmids encoding six histidine-tagged versions of fumarase and derivatives are described elsewhere (14Sass E. Blachinsky E. Karniely S. Pines O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46111-46117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). For pFUMΔ255, pFT2 was cut with Bgl-II (and filled in) and HpaI and ligated. For, pFUMΔ59, the NsiI of pFT2 was filled in and changed to BamHI by subcloning into the Bluescript (+/-) SmaI site. The resulting plasmid was cleaved with BamHI and ligated. For pFUMΔ32, pFT2 was cut with BamHI, and Acc65I was filled in and ligated. For pFUMΔ95, an SmaI site was introduced into pFT2 with the oligonucleotide 5′-TCACCCGGGGGTACCACCTTGTGCCA-3′, and the resulting plasmid was cut with SmaI and HpaI and then ligated. pΔB contains a deletion of the DNA sequence encoding amino acids 335–350; we used primers 5′-TTGGGTCGAC CTGCAGC-3′ and 5′-GGGGTTAAC TTCATGGTAGCCGCAACG-3′ and cloned the PCR product (on an FUM1 template) into the SalI and HpaI sites of pFT2. pΔCter contains a deletion of the DNA sequence encoding amino acids 421–488; we used the SalI primer with 5′-CCGGGCCCTTA CTCATTGGCTTTGATACC-3′ and cloned the PCR product (on an FUM1 template) into the SalI and SmaI sites of pFT2-sma (a pFT2 derivative with an SmaI site before the stop codon). The following pFT2 derivatives were created by PCR using the primer-overlapping method (15Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6812) Google Scholar). For pΔE, pFT2 encoding fumarase with a deletion between positions 101–119, we used primers 5′-GCTATTCAACAGTTCCAAACGGGTTCCG-3′ and 5′-CGTTTGGAACTGTTGAATAGCCTTGG-3′. pM5, pFT2 encoding fumarase containing five substitutions (Ala103 → Ser, Ser108 → Asp, His114 → Lys, Pro116 → Val, and Val118 → Asp) was created by using primers 5′-GTTGCTGATGGTAAGCTT GATGATAAATTTGTTTTGGATGTTTTCCAAACGGGTTCCGCG-3′ and 5′-CATCAAGCTT ACCATCAGCAACTTCATCAGAGGCCTGTTGAATAGCCTTGG-3′. Metabolic Labeling—Induced cultures (in galactose) were harvested and labeled with 10 μCi/ml [35S]methionine and incubated further for 30 min at 30 °C or as indicated. When required, 20 μm CCCP was added at the start of labeling. The labeled cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in TE buffer (pH 8.0) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, broken with glass beads, and centrifuged to obtain the supernatant fraction. Supernatants were denatured by boiling in 1% SDS, immunoprecipitated with anti-fumarase rabbit antiserum and protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Subcellular Fractionation—Induced yeast cultures were grown to 1.5 A at 600 nm. Mitochondria were isolated as described previously (9Knox C. Sass E. Neupert W. Pines O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25587-25593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Spheroplasts were prepared in the presence of Zymolyase-20T (ICN Pharmaceuticals). Each of our subcellular fractionation experiments were assayed for the activity of mitochondrial (citrate synthase or isocitrate dehydrogenase) and cytosolic (glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase) enzymes. In Western blots, αHSP60 or αHSP70 were used as mitochondrial markers. For labeled fractionation, strains were grown in 40 ml of synthetic dextrose medium at 24 °C. When cultures reached 1.5–2.0 A, they were labeled with 400 μCi for 15 min. Labeling was stopped by the addition of excess cold methionine, cysteine, 0.1 mg/ml cycloheximide, and 10 mm NaN3. After the labeling, standard fractionation and immunoprecipitation were performed. Biotin Labeling—Water-soluble biotin cross-linker (Biotin-x-NHS, Calbiochem) was used at a final concentration of 9 mm in 20 mm phosphate buffer. The cross-linker was incubated at 4 °C with purified mitochondria prepared by standard subcellular fractionation, as described previously (9Knox C. Sass E. Neupert W. Pines O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25587-25593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and the reaction was stopped by using 40 mm ammonium chloride. Samples were immunoprecipitated with fumarase antiserum and electro-blotted, followed by detection of biotinylated protein with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin. Enzyme Activities—Induced cultures (in galactose) were harvested and resuspended in TE buffer (pH 8.0) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, broken with glass beads, and centrifuged to obtain the supernatant fraction. Fumarase was assayed by the method of Kanarek and Hill (16Kanarek L. Hill R. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 5: 465-474Google Scholar) at 250 nm with l-malic acid as substrate. Citrate synthase was assayed by following the reduction of acetyl-CoA in the presence of 5,5′-dithiobis(nitrobenzoic acid) at 412 nm (17Worthington, C. C. E., ed (1988) Worthington Manual, pp. 159–161Google Scholar). Isocitrate dehydrogenase was measured by following the formation of NADH at 340 nm. Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase was assayed by following the formation of NADH in the presence of glucose-6-phosphate at 340 nm (18Weizman P.D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1969; 13: 22-24Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (19Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar). Blue Native Gels—Blue native gel electrophoresis was performed according to Schagger (20Schagger H. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65: 231-244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unless indicated otherwise, detergents were omitted from all solutions. Culture extracts were prepared with glass beads in buffer (0.5 m e-caproic acid, 20 mm Bistris, pH 7.0, 2 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol) and centrifuged for 15 min at 10,000 × g (at 4 °C). The recovered supernatants were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with native loading buffer, separated on a gradient gel (5.5–16%), and blotted as described (20Schagger H. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65: 231-244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mass Spectrometry—Histidine-tagged fumarase derivatives were expressed in yeast under the GAL10 promoter, cell-free extracts were prepared, and the proteins were affinity-purified using Co+2 (Clontech) or Ni+2 (Qiagen) columns under denaturing conditions, according to the manufacturer's instructions. For matrix-assisted laser-desorption time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) analysis, peptides were deposited on a metal target as co-crystals with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Aldrich). The mass spectrometry analysis was done using MALDI-TOF (2E, Micromass, UK) in the positive ion mode. For QTOF analysis, samples were subjected to reverse-phase HPLC followed by solid-phase extraction with C4 reverse-phase resin-filled tips (Zip Tips, Waters Associates). After elution with 75% CH3CN and 5% CHOOH, the solution was adjusted to a concentration of ∼0.3 μg/μl in 65% CH3CN, 3% CHOOH, and nanosprayed into the QTOF MS system. Deconvolution was carried out by the Maxent1 program. Mass spectrometry was carried out with QTOF2 (Micromass) using a nanospray attachment (21Wilm M. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (1696) Google Scholar). Data analysis was done with the BioLynx package (Micromass). Proteinase K Resistance—10 ml of induced cultures (in galactose) were harvested, resuspended in 400 μl of cold PK buffer (0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 2.5 m EDTA), and broken with glass beads. Total extracts were equilibrated to the same protein concentration with PK buffer and incubated with varying concentrations of proteinase K (1.0–5.0 μg/ml) at 30 °C for 10 min. Proteolysis was stopped by the addition of 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, incubated further on ice for 15 min, and boiled in SDS gel loading buffer. Samples were analyzed on 10% SDS-PAGE, electro-blotted, and probed with fumarase antiserum. Subcellular Localization of Mutant Fumarases—The fumarase amino terminus contains the mitochondrial-targeting sequence and the deletion of the signal peptide results as expected in exclusive cytosolic localization (1Stein I. Peleg Y. Even-Ram S. Pines O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4770-4778Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 8Wu M. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12275-12282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Peleg Y. Rokem J.S. Goldberg I. Pines O. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1990; 56: 2777-2783Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because fumarase targeting to mitochondria occurs only while it is being translated, we initially assumed that distribution information would be located at the amino terminus of the protein. Nevertheless, as reported previously, the exchange of the fumarase signal peptide for that of cytochrome b2 or deletion of the sequence immediately downstream to the cleavage site (through amino acid 37) did not abolish the dual distribution phenomenon (14Sass E. Blachinsky E. Karniely S. Pines O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46111-46117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Here, in a rather brutal approach, a fumarase gene was created and expressed harboring a 255 amino acid deletion from a total of 488 amino acids (Fig. 1A, Δ96–350). Cultures of S. cerevisiae were grown on galactose as the carbon source to induce the expression of fumarase derivatives under the GAL10 promoter. Subcellular fractionation of these cultures revealed that Δ255 exhibited a complete alteration of distribution; the vast majority was targeted to mitochondria, whereas for the wild type, most of the fumarase (∼70%) is in the cytosol. The exclusive targeting and localization of mHsp60 to mitochondria demonstrates the integrity of the organelles in these experiments (Fig. 1A). In addition, each of our subcellular fractionation experiments were carefully controlled by assaying for the activity of mitochondrial (citrate synthase or isocitrate dehydrogenase) and cytosolic (glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase) enzymes. We then created shorter deletions within fumarase based on the structure of the protein. The fumarase subunit, based on the crystal structure (24Weaver T. Lees M. Zaitsev V. Zaitseva I. Duke E. Lindley P. McSweeny S. Svensson A. Keruchenko J. Keruchenko I. Gladilin K. Banaszak L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), has three domains (amino acids 24–160, amino acids 161–419, and amino acids 420–488). The middle domain forms a 5-helix bundle, which in the full tetramer is part of a 20-helix bundle. The active site of fumarase is predicted to be situated between interfaces of the amino-terminal, carboxyl terminal, and middle domains. Here we show that deletions within each one of these domains abolished dual targeting, with essentially all of the fumarase being targeted to mitochondria (Fig. 1A, Δ33–91, Δ256–350, and Δ421–488). All of these fumarase derivatives, including the 255-amino acid deletion, were efficiently processed in yeast cells in a membrane potential-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). This was shown by labeling yeast cultures expressing the various fumarases with [35S]methionine either in the presence or absence of the proton ionophore CCCP and was followed by preparation of cell extracts, immunoprecipitation, PAGE, and autoradiography. Upon blocking import of these proteins into mitochondria, the precursor forms were detected (Fig. 1B, compare CCCP – with +). Thus, these derivatives, like the wild type, have retained their ability to be targeted and processed in mitochondria but, in contrast, have lost the ability to move back into the cytosol by retrograde movement. To examine the effect of shorter deletions, two sequences of fumarase were chosen, one that seemed more conserved in eukaryotes than in prokaryotes and another that is part of the active site of the enzyme. The first was acquired by comparing the fumarase sequence from eukaryotes and prokaryotes using the ClustalX program. Fumarase was distributed between the cytosol and mitochondria of all eukaryotes examined (26Akiba T. Hiraga K. Tuboi S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1984; 96: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The notion was that if a sequence dedicated to distribution exists in fumarase, then it may be conserved in eukaryotes but not in bacteria, for which distribution is meaningless. One of a number of such candidate sequences is located between amino acids 102–119. Deletion of this sequence caused exclusive targeting of fumarase to mitochondria (Fig. 1A, Δ102–119). This was also true for substitutions within this sequence, and, as shown in Fig. 1, substitutions of five amino acids (M5-SALVA) of yeast fumarase for amino acids frequently found at corresponding positions in bacterial fumarases still abolished dual targeting. The second sequence examined was via a deletion of a 16 amino acid sequence of fumarase that has been implicated as being part of the active site of the enzyme (24Weaver T. Lees M. Zaitsev V. Zaitseva I. Duke E. Lindley P. McSweeny S. Svensson A. Keruchenko J. Keruchenko I. Gladilin K. Banaszak L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Like the other deletions, this deletion caused a total mis-distribution of mature fumarase to mitochondria (Fig. 1A, ΔB Δ335–350). The various deletion and mutant fumarases described above seem to be targeted to mitochondria and processed, yet whether they are fully imported or remain adhered to the surface of the organelle remained to be determined. Fumarase expressed in yeast in vivo is very resistant to proteases because of its very compact folding, and therefore, protease sensitivity was not our first choice for such localization studies. For this reason, we employed cross-linking with biotin in which the linking agent was not membrane permeable. Only proteins that are inside the mitochondrial membranes are protected from this labeling, whereas treatment with detergent dissolves the membranes and exposes all the protein to the linker. Isolated mitochondria from cultures expressing the various fumarase derivatives were treated with Biotin-X-NHS in the presence or absence of Triton. Quencher (NH4Cl) was added, and extracts of the mitochondria were prepared, immunoprecipitated with fumarase antiserum, run on SDS-PAGE, electro-blotted, and detected with horseradish peroxidase-streptavidin. As shown in Fig. 2, mtHsp70, a matrix resident protein, was labeled weakly in the absence of Triton, whereas fumarase lacking a signal peptide (small amounts of which nonspecifically adhere to mitochondria, not shown) presents identical labeling in the presence or absence of Triton. Based on this analysis (Fig. 2), one can conclude that wild-type fumarase, ΔE, ΔB, and ΔCter are translocated across the membrane into mitochondria, because their signal is significantly weaker in the absence of Triton than in its presence (Fig. 2, top panels, compare + and –). An exception, which we do not understand at present, is Δ59, for which there is a very similar signal with and without Triton. This protein had not leaked out of the mitochondria, according to subcellular fractionation controls (see above), but rather remained adhered externally to mitochondria (after being completely processed by MPP) because it was fully biotinylated (Fig. 1B). The amount of fumarase in treated and untreated samples was determined by regular Western blot analysis with mthsp70 and fumarase antiserum (Fig. 1B, bottom panels). Activity, Resistance to Proteolysis, and Tetramerization of Fumarase—Importantly, none of the deletions or substitutions exhibited enzymatic activity when expressed in yeast. Table I presents the activities found in the cell extracts of yeast strains expressing the various fumarases under the GAL10 promoter. Whereas extracts from cells expressing the wild-type protein or the protein lacking a signal peptide exhibit high fumarase specific activity, extracts from all the mutants exhibit a low specific activity, which is similar to the background activity provided by the chromosomally encoded enzyme. The reason we did not use chromosomal knockouts in most experiments was to avoid complications of petite phenotypes. Nevertheless, the ability to complement the fum1 petite phenotype of a knockout strain is a means of examining fumarase activity in vivo (Table I). In this regard, the ability to complement the petite phenotype is not dependent on mitochondrial targeting because fumarase lacking a signal sequence (ΔSP), which is not imported into mitochondria, is capable of complementation of a fumarase knockout strain. None of the mutants in the current study were capable of complementing the FUM1 deletion, indicating that they were devoid of activity in the cells. Even the M5-SALVA exhibited no enzymatic activity or capability of complementation, even though its alteration did not lie within the active site of fumarase. One can assume that the inactivity of M5-SALVA was the result of a change in conformation.Table IComplementation and enzymatic activity of mutant fumarasesFumarase plasmid (chromosome)VariationSpecific activity of proteinGAL10-FUM1Complementation by the plasmidaThe ability of the respective plasmid to complement the petite phenotype of a fuml knockout yeast strain.μmol/min/mg protein%Fum1 (+)Unmutated19.2100+Fum-ΔSP (+)Δaa(1-23)19.9103+M5 (+)SALVA0.74-Deletions (+)—bΔ255, Δ59, Δ32, Δ95, ΔE, ΔB, ΔCter0.2-0.51-3-(+)Chromosomal wild type0.42-(-)Chromosomal knockoutND0-a The ability of the respective plasmid to complement the petite phenotype of a fuml knockout yeast strain.b Δ255, Δ59, Δ32, Δ95, ΔE, ΔB, ΔCter Open table in a new tab Another indication for changes in the conformation in the various mutant fumarases described here comes from examination of protease sensitivity of fumarase derivatives in cell extracts. Changes in conformation that affect the compactness of the protein are expected to increase sensitivity to cleavage by proteases. Two experiments in which cell extracts were treated with increasing concentrations of PK (Fig. 3) were subsequently analyzed by Western blotting. Our deletion mutants (e.g. Δ32, Δ59, ΔB, and ΔCter) were very sensitive to PK. On the other hand, M5-SALVA and ΔE show only a slight increase in sensitivity to PK. Thus, even minor effects detected in the final conformation of the protein may indicate an alteration in fumarase folding during import which, in turn, causes mis-distribution. The quaternary structure of fumarase and derivative mutants was examined by testing their ability to form tetramers, which is the structure of the active enzyme. Extracts of yeast cultures expressing the different fumarases were subjected to Blue native PAGE and then were blotted and detected with anti-fumarase antiserum. Wild-type fumarase is partially disassembled in 1% CHAPS, thus allowing detection of both the monomer and tetramer in a single sample. As shown in Fig. 4, WT, ΔE, ΔB, and ΔCter readily form tetramers, whereas for ΔB there is a smear of higher and lower bands, indicating a problem in normal assembly of this mutant fumarase into tetramers. Interestingly, the deletion in ΔB occurs within the middle domain, whereas the other deletions occur within the amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains. In fact, the crystal structure of fumarase (24Weaver T. Lees M. Zaitsev V. Zaitseva I. Duke E. Lindley P. McSweeny S. Svensson A. Keruchenko J. Keruchenko I. Gladilin K. Banaszak L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) indicates that the middle domain forms a five-helix bundle which, in the full protein, together with the middle domains of the other three subunits, forms a bundle of 20 α-helices, which, in turn, probably hold the tetramer together. With respect to subcellular distribution, formation of the tetramer does not ensure that dual targeting will occur. Mass Spectrometry of Fumarase Isoenzymes—It has been shown previously that fumarase mitochondrial and cytosolic isoenzymes migrate identically on SDS-PAGE (1Stein I. Peleg Y. Even-Ram S. Pines O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4770-4778Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (27Blachinski E. Molecular Biology.

https://openalex.org/W1975830464,"The secretory vesicle protein synaptotagmin I (syt) plays a critical role in Ca2+-triggered exocytosis. Its cytoplasmic domain is composed of tandem C2 domains, C2A and C2B; each C2 domain binds Ca2+. Upon binding Ca2+, positively charged residues within the Ca2+-binding loops are thought to interact with negatively charged phospholipids in the target membrane to mediate docking of the cytoplasmic domain of syt onto lipid bilayers. The C2 domains of syt also interact with syntaxin and SNAP-25, two components of a conserved membrane fusion complex. Here, we have neutralized single positively charged residues at the membrane-binding interface of C2A (R233Q) and C2B (K366Q). Either of these mutations shifted the Ca2+ requirements for syt-liposome interactions from ∼20 to ∼40 μm Ca2+. Kinetic analysis revealed that the reduction in Ca2+-sensing activity was associated with a decrease in affinity for membranes. These mutations did not affect sytsyntaxin interactions but resulted in a ∼50% loss in SNAP-25 binding activity, suggesting that these residues lie at an interface between membranes and SNAP-25. Expression of full-length versions of syt that harbored these mutations reduced the rate of exocytosis in PC12 cells. In both biochemical and functional assays, effects of the R233Q and K366Q mutations were not additive, indicating that mutations in one domain affect the activity of the adjacent domain. These findings indicate that the tandem C2 domains of syt cooperate with one another to trigger release via loop-mediated electrostatic interactions with effector molecules. The secretory vesicle protein synaptotagmin I (syt) plays a critical role in Ca2+-triggered exocytosis. Its cytoplasmic domain is composed of tandem C2 domains, C2A and C2B; each C2 domain binds Ca2+. Upon binding Ca2+, positively charged residues within the Ca2+-binding loops are thought to interact with negatively charged phospholipids in the target membrane to mediate docking of the cytoplasmic domain of syt onto lipid bilayers. The C2 domains of syt also interact with syntaxin and SNAP-25, two components of a conserved membrane fusion complex. Here, we have neutralized single positively charged residues at the membrane-binding interface of C2A (R233Q) and C2B (K366Q). Either of these mutations shifted the Ca2+ requirements for syt-liposome interactions from ∼20 to ∼40 μm Ca2+. Kinetic analysis revealed that the reduction in Ca2+-sensing activity was associated with a decrease in affinity for membranes. These mutations did not affect sytsyntaxin interactions but resulted in a ∼50% loss in SNAP-25 binding activity, suggesting that these residues lie at an interface between membranes and SNAP-25.

In both biochemical and functional assays, effects of the R233Q and K366Q mutations were not additive, indicating that mutations in one domain affect the activity of the adjacent domain. These findings indicate that the tandem C2 domains of syt cooperate with one another to trigger release via loop-mediated electrostatic interactions with effector molecules. Synaptotagmins are a family of proteins thought to function in the fusion and recycling of synaptic vesicles, large dense core granules, lysosomes, and potentially other trafficking organelles (1Marqueze B. Berton F. Seagar M. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 409-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 2Craxton M. Genomics. 2001; 77: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 3Chapman E.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 498-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Members of this gene family are anchored to the membranes of secretory organelles via an N-terminal transmembrane domain and have a large cytoplasmic domain composed of two conserved motifs called C2 domains that, in many isoforms of synaptotagmin, form Ca2+-sensing modules. The membrane-proximal C2 domain is C2A and the C-terminal C2 domain is C2B. The most abundant isoform in brain is synaptotagmin I (syt), 1The abbreviations used are: sytsynaptotagmin IPS1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-l-serine]PC1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholinePE1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolaminedansyl-PE1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-(5-dimethylamino-1-naphthalenesulfulfonyl)FRETfluorescence resonance energy transferWTwild typeGSTglutathione S-transferaseAEDANS5-[2-(acetyl)amino]ethyl]amino]naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid.1The abbreviations used are: sytsynaptotagmin IPS1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-l-serine]PC1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholinePE1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolaminedansyl-PE1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-(5-dimethylamino-1-naphthalenesulfulfonyl)FRETfluorescence resonance energy transferWTwild typeGSTglutathione S-transferaseAEDANS5-[2-(acetyl)amino]ethyl]amino]naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid. where the Ca2+-sensing ability of each of its C2 domains appears be critical for docked synaptic vesicles to fuse in response to stimulation (4Fernandez-Chacon R.

The key to the function of syt lies in understanding how Ca2+ triggers the activation of its tandem C2 domains. Insights into how metals activate C2 domains began with structural studies of the C2 domain of phospholipase C δ-1, where it was shown that metal binding opened two Ca2+ binding loops or “jaws,” resulting in significant changes in the electrostatic potential around the jaws (9Grobler J.A. Essen L.O. Williams R.L. Hurley J.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 788-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). It was subsequently demonstrated that Ca2+ triggers the partial penetration of these jaws/loops into lipid bilayers (10Chapman E.R. Davis A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13995-14001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 11Davis A.F. Bai J. Fasshauer D. Wolowick M.J. Lewis J.L. Chapman E.R.

A. 2002; 99: 1665-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Whereas hydrophobic interactions between some side chains and the interior of the bilayer occur, the overall interaction of the C2 domains of syt with anionic lipid surfaces is highly sensitive to increases in ionic strength (10Chapman E.R. Davis A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13995-14001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), consistent with an electrostatic mechanism for docking onto membranes. These loops dip into membranes at Ca2+ levels that trigger secretion and with kinetics that are rapid enough to mediate excitation-secretion coupling (13Bai J. Wang P. Chapman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1665-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). These findings prompted a model in which the C2 domains of syt interact with lipids in the plasma membrane to help pull the bilayers together to accelerate Ca2+-triggered membrane fusion (3Chapman E.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 498-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that syt may also regulate membrane fusion through interactions with components of the SNARE complex. This complex is composed of a vesicle SNARE (v-SNARE; synaptobrevin/VAMP) and two target membrane SNAREs (t-SNAREs; syntaxin and SNAP-25 (15Sollner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2588) Google Scholar)) that assemble into a parallel four-helix bundle (16Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1879) Google Scholar). Zippering together of SNARE proteins is thought to pull the lipid bilayers together to mediate membrane fusion (17Weber T. Zemelman B.V. McNew J.A. Westermann B. Gmachl M. Parlati F. Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 759-772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1988) Google Scholar). Syt binds directly to syntaxin and SNAP-25 in a Ca2+-promoted manner (18Bennett M.K. Calakos N. Scheller R.H. Science. 1992; 257: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar, 19Schiavo G. Stenbeck G. Rothman J.E. Sollner T.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Baltus A.E. Garment M.B. Carlson S.D. Ganetzky B. Chapman E.R. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1421-1433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and enhances the rate of SNARE catalyzed membrane fusion (22Mahal L.K. Sequeira S.M. Gureasko J.M. Sollner T.H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), but these effects were not modulated by Ca2+, suggesting that additional factors are required to impart Ca2+ control to SNARE-catalyzed membrane fusion in vivo. In PC12 cells, mutations in SNAP-25 that selectively disrupt interactions with syt reduce secretion (23Zhang X. Kim-Miller M.J. Fukuda M. Kowalchyk J.A. Martin T.F. Neuron. 2002; 34: 599-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), and selective inhibitors of syt-t-SNARE interactions acutely block exocytosis (24Earles C.A. Bai J. Wang P. Chapman E.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 1117-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), further supporting a functional role for syt-t-SNARE interactions during release. NMR studies suggested that syt binds syntaxin in the same manner that it engages lipid bilayers (25Ubach J. Zhang X. Shao X. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3921-3930Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 26Fernandez I. Ubach J. Dulubova I. Zhang X. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. Cell. 1998; 94: 841-849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). However, these studies were largely based on a fragment of syntaxin that is completely dispensable for binding (20Chapman E.R. Hanson P.I. An S. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23667-23671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 27Matos M.F. Rizo J. Sudhof T.C. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 79: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Thus, little is known concerning the interfaces that mediate assembly of syt with t-SNAREs (3Chapman E.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 498-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Here, we report experiments aimed at testing a current model in which Ca2+ activates the C2 domains of syt by flipping an electrostatic switch. In this model, the change in electrostatic potential around the Ca2+-binding loops of syt triggers interactions with effector molecules to drive secretion. To test this and to selectively tune the membrane binding affinity of syt, we neutralized positively charged residues in the membrane penetration loops of each C2 domain. R233Q in C2A and K366Q in C2B shifted the Ca2+ dependence for binding to membranes to higher [Ca2+] and reduced the affinity of syt for membranes. When expressed in PC12 cells, these mutant forms of syt reduced the rate of secretion. Unexpectedly, in each of the assays described in this study, the effects of the R233Q and K366Q mutations were not additive, indicating that mutations in one C2 domain can affect the properties of the adjacent C2 domain. Surprisingly, both of the charge neutralization mutations also selectively reduced SNAP-25 binding activity. These data suggest that residues 233 and 366, in the tips of the membrane penetration loops, lie at a junction between Ca2+, membranes, and components of the SNARE complex. Perturbation of the electrostatic potential at the distal tips of these loops disrupts exocytosis, supporting the electrostatic switch model for activation of syt.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5854-5860Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), bead-immobilized proteins were treated with RNase/DNase (10 μg/ml in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 m NaCl, and 1 mm MgCl2) for 10 min at room temperature. Samples were then washed three times in HEPES buffer (50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 0.1 m NaCl), and in some cases the syt fragments were cleaved from the GST moiety using thrombin as described (32Chapman E.R.

Lipids—Synthetic 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-l-serine] (PS), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PC), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (PE), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-(5-dimethylamino-1-naphthalenesulfulfonyl) (dansyl-PE), and brain phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids. Lipids were dried under a stream of nitrogen and suspended in HEPES buffer. For fluorescence studies, large (∼100-nm) unilamellar liposomes were prepared by extrusion as described previously (11Davis A.F. Bai J. Fasshauer D. Wolowick M.J. Lewis J.L. Chapman E.R.

Liposomes were prepared by sonication using a Microson ultrasonic cell disruptor (Misonics), and 3H-labeled liposome binding assays were carried out as described previously (11Davis A.F. Bai J. Fasshauer D. Wolowick M.J. Lewis J.L. Chapman E.R. Neuron. 1999; 24: 363-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) in 100 μl of HEPES buffer using 6 μg of immobilized protein and 22 nm liposomes per data point. In all experiments, error bars represent the S.D. from triplicate determinations. Stopped-flow Rapid Mixing Experiments—Kinetics experiments were carried out using an Applied Photophysics SX.18MV stopped-flow spectrometer at 25 °C as described (11Davis A.F. Bai J. Fasshauer D. Wolowick M.J. Lewis J.L. Chapman E.R. Neuron. 1999; 24: 363-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Binding was monitored via fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). The Trp residues in C2A (5 μm) or C2A-C2B (2 μm) were excited at 285 nm, and the emission from the dansyl-PE acceptor (5% dansyl-PE, 25% PS, 70% PC) was collected using a 523-nm band pass filter. Proteins were loaded into one syringe of the stopped flow, and Ca2+/EGTA plus liposomes were loaded into the other syringe. After mixing (dead time ∼1.2 ms), a rapid increase in fluorescence was observed in samples containing Ca2+. The on (kon) and off rates (koff) of syt-liposome complexes were calculated, assuming pseudo-first-order kinetics, according to the following equation.kods=[liposome]kon+koff(Eq. 1) Co-sedimentation Assays—Large (∼100 nm) unilamellar liposomes were prepared by extrusion as described (11Davis A.F. Bai J. Fasshauer D. Wolowick M.J. Lewis J.L. Chapman E.R. Neuron. 1999; 24: 363-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). 4 μm syt fragments were incubated with 22 nm liposomes composed of 25% PS/75% PC (2 mm total lipids) in 150 μl of HEPES buffer for 15 min at room temperature, in the presence of 1 mm Ca2+ or 2 mm EGTA. Samples were then centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 40 min in a Beckman Optima MAX-E table top ultracentrifuge, and the supernatants and pellets were separated. Pellets were washed once with 150 μl of HEPES buffer and collected again via centrifugation. Equal fractions of the supernatants and pellets were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and proteins were stained with Coomassie Blue. Measuring syt-t-SNARE Interactions—Binding of wild type and mutant C2A-C2B to bead-immobilized full-length GST-syntaxin and GST-SNAP-25 was monitored as described (24Earles C.A. Bai J. Wang P. Chapman E.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 1117-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) but as a function of [Ca2+]free. Briefly, 15 μg of immobilized t-SNARE was incubated with 1.5 μm syt in 150 μl of HEPES-buffered saline for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times in binding buffer, bound protein was solubilized by boiling in SDS sample buffer, and samples were separated by SDS-PAGE. Bound syt was detected using an anti-syt I monoclonal antibody (41.1) and Pierce SuperSignal enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents in the linear range. Binding of syt to SNAP-25 was also monitored in solution using FRET. For these experiments, the native Trp residues in C2A-C2B were excited at 285 nm and served as the energy donors. The Cys residues of SNAP-25 were labeled with 1,5-IAEDANS (5-[[2-[(iodoacetyl)amino]ethy]amino]naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid) (labeling was carried out as described for syt in Ref. 13Bai J. Wang P. Chapman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1665-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar; the stoichiometry for AEDANS to SNAP-25 was ∼3.6:1) and served as energy acceptors (34Chapman E.R. Alexander K. Vorherr T. Carafoli E. Storm D.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12819-12825Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Fluorescence measurements were made at 24 °C using a PTI QM-1 fluorometer and Felix software. C2A-C2B (2 μm) and AEDANS-SNAP-25 (0.5 μm) were mixed in a cuvette using a castle-style stir bar, and the emission of the acceptor was collected from 430 to 550 nm (2-nm slits) as a function of [Ca2+]free. Emission spectra were corrected for blank, dilution, and instrument response. Amperometry—Full-length syt (wild type (WT), R233Q, K366Q, and R233Q/K366Q double mutant) were subcloned into pIRES2EGFP and transfected into PC12 cells via electroporation, and their effects on secretion were monitored from green fluorescent protein-positive cells using carbon fiber amperometry as described (35Wang C.T. Grishanin R. Earles C.A. Chang P.Y. Martin T.F. Chapman E.R. Jackson M.B. Science. 2001; 294: 1111-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were depolarized with 105 mm KCl for 6.5 s using a picospritzer. Release was monitored by applying a polarization potential (+650 mV) to a freshly cut 5-μm carbon fiber electrode (ALA Scientific Instruments) placed against the cell. A VA-10 npi amplifier (ALA Scientific Instruments) amplified and transferred the signal to a computer running pClamp8. The signal was digitized at 4 kHz and low pass-filtered at 1 kHz. The distal tips of the Ca2+-binding loops of syt I (shown in Fig. 6) rapidly penetrate into lipid bilayers composed of PS/PC. This was first shown by placing fluorescent reporters at positions 234 in C2A and 367 in C2B (10Chapman E.R. Davis A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13995-14001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 11Davis A.F. Bai J. Fasshauer D. Wolowick M.J. Lewis J.L. Chapman E.R.

Chem. 2000; 275: 25427-25435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). These positions are flanked by positively charged residues, Arg233 and Lys366, hypothesized to participate in electrostatic interactions with the head groups of anionic phospholipids, an idea that was prompted by the observation that syt selectively binds to membranes that contain negatively charged lipids (14Chapman E.R. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5735-5741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Davletov B.A. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26386-26390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To test this, we neutralized Arg233 and Lys366 by substitution with glutamine. We then determined the effects of these mutations on syt-effector interactions and on secretion. Analysis of the isolated C2A domain revealed that the R233Q mutation shifted the [Ca2+]½ for binding liposomes composed of PS/PC from 19 ± 0.8 to 42 ± 0.5 μm Ca2+ (Hill coefficients of 2.6 ± 0.2 to 3.6 ± 0.2; Fig. 1A). Similar results were reported in a previous study (4Fernandez-Chacon R. Konigstorfer A. Gerber S.H. Garcia J. Matos M.F. Stevens C.F. Brose N. Rizo J. Rosenmund C. Sudhof T.C. Nature. 2001; 410: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). At saturating Ca2+, the total level of binding was slightly reduced in the R233Q mutant, suggesting that the affinity of Ca2+-loaded C2A-liposomes interactions might be impaired (for more details, see below). In the context of C2A-C2B, the C2B domain of syt also binds tightly to liposomes composed of PS/PC (13Bai J. Wang P. Chapman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This finding raises the question of whether an adjacent wild type C2B domain can compensate for the impaired interaction of R233Q-C2A with membranes. As shown in Fig. 1B, the R233Q mutation shifted the Ca2+ dependence of the intact cytoplasmic domain of syt (designated C2A-C2B) from 18 ± 1.0 to 37 ± 0.7 μm; thus, C2B failed to rescue this defect under steady-state conditions. Interestingly, the K366Q mutation resulted in a virtually identical shift as did the R233Q mutation (EC50 = 35 ± 0.4 μm Ca2+), consistent with the idea that C2A and C2B dock onto membranes via similar electrostatic interactions (13Bai J. Wang P. Chapman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1665-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). We then determined whether the effects of R233Q in C2A and K366Q in C2B were additive and found that this was not the case; the double mutant had an EC50 of 36 ± 0.9 μm (Fig. 1B). With the exception of the experiment on isolated C2A, these mutations selectively shifted the apparent affinity for Ca2+, leaving the Hill coefficient unchanged. To further characterize the effects of the R233Q and K366Q mutations, we assayed for membrane binding activity using a C2A-C2B-liposome co-sedimentation assay. Sedimentation involves both the membrane binding and oligomerization activity of C2A-C2B (37Wu Y. He Y. Bai J. Ji S.R. Tucker W.C. Chapman E.R. Sui S.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2082-2087Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, WT C2A-C2B co-sediments with liposomes that contain PS/PC in a strictly Ca2+-dependent manner. In contrast, C2A-C2B exhibits significant levels of co-sedimentation with phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2)/PC membranes in the absence of Ca2+ (Fig. 2A); co-sedimentation is complete in the presence of Ca2+. As negative controls, C2A-C2B did not co-sediment with liposomes composed of PC or PE/PC (Fig. 2A). Co-sedimentation assays were repeated for WT and the charge neutralization mutants as a function of increasing ionic strength (Fig. 2B). Consistent with previous reports, membrane interactions are highly sensitive to [NaCl] (10Chapman E.R. Davis A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13995-14001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The R233Q and K366Q single and double mutant versions of C2A-C2B were more readily stripped from the liposomes by increasing the ionic strength (Fig. 2C). These results are consistent with the idea that Arg233 and Lys366 participate in the docking of the cytoplasmic domain of syt onto membranes. The effects of the charge neutralization mutations on the affinity of syt-PS/PC interactions were first addressed by measuring the on and off rates of WT and R233Q mutant C2A-liposome interactions in response to Ca2+. FRET from a naturally occurring tryptophan residue (in position 259) to a dansyl-PE acceptor that has been incorporated into the liposomes was used to monitor binding in real time using a stopped-flow rapid mixing approach. Representative kinetic traces are shown in Fig. 3A; kobs was plotted as a function of the liposome concentration (Fig. 3A, inset), and the rate constants are summarized in Table I. The R233Q mutation increased the off-rate and decreased the on-rate, resulting in a ∼13-fold reduction in affinity of C2A for membranes (Table I).Table IKinetics of syt-PS/PC interactions The data shown in the table correspond to the experiments described in the legend to Fig. 3.

There is an initial activation of cPLA2 that induces expression of Group V PLA2, which in turn induces both the expression of COX-2 and most of the arachidonic acid substrate for COX-2-dependent prostaglandin E2 generation. Because Group V PLA2 is a secreted enzyme, it has been assumed that after cellular stimulation, it must be released to the extracellular medium and re-associates with the outer membrane to release arachidonic acid from phospholipids. In the present study, confocal laser scanning microscopy experiments utilizing both immunofluorescence and green fluorescent protein-labeled Group V PLA2 shows that chronic exposure of the macrophages to lipopolysaccharide results in Group V PLA2 being associated with caveolin-2-containing granules close to the perinuclear region. Heparin, a cell-impermeable complex carbohydrate with high affinity for Group V PLA2, blocks that association, suggesting that the granules are formed by internalization of the Group V sPLA2 previously associated with the outer cellular surface. Localization of Group V PLA2 in perinuclear granules is not observed if the cells are treated with the Group IV PLA2 inhibitor methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphonate, confirming the important role for Group IV PLA2 in the activation process. Cellular staining with antibodies against COX-2 reveals the presence of COX-2-rich granules in close proximity to those containing Group V PLA2. Collectively, these results suggest that encapsulation of Group V PLA2 into granules brings the enzyme to the perinuclear envelope during cell activation where it may be closer to Group IV PLA2 and COX-2 for efficient prostaglandin synthesis.

Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1488: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar). PLA2 constitutes the main metabolic route by which fatty acids such as arachidonic acid (AA) are liberated from their lipid storage sites for the synthesis of eicosanoids, a family of compounds with important pathophysiological roles. Controlling the production of eicosanoids has been found to be of great benefit for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. The PLA2-catalyzed release of AA constitutes a new alternative pharmacological target for the development of anti-inflammatory therapies, and it is for this reason that mammalian PLA2s have been so extensively studied in the recent years (2Murakami M. Kudo I. Prostaglandins. 2002; 68–69: 3-583Google Scholar). However, the signaling cascades and the identification of mechanisms for PLA2 activation is a very complicated issue because of the presence of multiple PLA2 forms within a single cell (3Balsinde J. Winstead M.V. Dennis E.A. FEBS Lett. 2002; 531: 2-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). phospholipase A2 cytosolic phospholipase A2 secreted phospholipase A2 arachidonic acid bacterial lipopolysaccharide cyclooxygenase-2 methyl arachidonoyl flourophosphonate prostaglandin prostaglandin E2 fluorescein isothiocyanate green fluorescent protein GFP-Group V sPLA2. phospholipase A2 cytosolic phospholipase A2 secreted phospholipase A2 arachidonic acid bacterial lipopolysaccharide cyclooxygenase-2 methyl arachidonoyl flourophosphonate prostaglandin prostaglandin E2 fluorescein isothiocyanate green fluorescent protein GFP-Group V sPLA2. Using the murine macrophage-like cell line P388D1, we have shown that AA mobilization and prostaglandin production in response to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) occurs in two temporally distinct manners. In an immediate phase, the LPS does not act as a trigger of the response itself but rather enables the cells to rapidly respond to a second pro-inflammatory stimulus such as platelet-activating factor (4Balsinde J.

This immediate phase (LPS-primed phase) is completed within minutes and appears to occur at the expense of pre-existing effectors. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production is detected within 10 min of cellular exposure to platelet-activating factor (after LPS priming), and depends on the coupling of three different enzymes: the cytosolic Group IV PLA2 (cPLA2), the Group V PLA2, and COX-2. The elevation of the intracellular Ca2+ generated by occupancy of the platelet-activating factor receptor appears to be a key signaling event for cPLA2 activation. The transient elevation of intracellular AA (or of one of its metabolites) would then help increase the activity of preexisting Group V PLA2, generating a second wave of AA liberation that would be metabolized to PGE2 by COX-2, which exists at low levels under these conditions (4Balsinde J.

In the second pathway of activation, called the delayed pathway, LPS induces AA release on its own in a process that takes several hours to develop and involves the de novo synthesis of two of the effector enzymes involved, namely Group V PLA2 and COX-2 (8Shinohara H.

Importantly, the elevated expression of these two effectors can be prevented by inhibiting the cPLA2 with methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphonate (MAFP) (6Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol.

Moreover, inhibition of Group V PLA2, by antisense technology or by chemical inhibitors, abolishes COX-2 expression in the LPS-treated cells (8Shinohara H. Balboa M.A. Johnson C.A. Balsinde J.

Thus Group V PLA2 plays two separate roles in the process: on one hand, it provides the bulk of AA release; on the other, Group V PLA2 controls the induction of the enzyme that metabolizes the free AA i.e. COX-2. It is interesting to note that, despite the marked differences between the two pathways of AA release involving LPS, both of them appear to utilize the same PLA2 effectors, i.e. cPLA2, and Group V sPLA2. The cPLA2 fundamentally plays a regulatory role, whereas the sPLA2 plays an augmentative role by providing most of the AA metabolized by COX-2 (6Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol.

Although some of these studies have suggested that this internalization may serve as a means to terminate signaling (i.e. the internalized protein is degraded) (12Kim K.P. Rafter J.D. Bittova L.

In the current work we have sought to study the subcellular localization of the de novo Group V sPLA2 in P388D1 cells treated with LPS to release AA and generate PGs in a delayed phase.

P388D1 cells were plated onto coverslips, allowed to adhere overnight, and used for experiments the following day. For stimulation, the cells were washed and placed in serum-free medium. Where indicated, the cells were incubated with 100 ng/ml LPS for the indicated periods of time. When heparin was used, it was added at 1 mg/ml. All experiments were conducted in serum-free medium. Immunofluorescence—After each treatment, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were then permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100/phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min at room temperature and blocked for 30 min in 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 2% normal donkey serum, and 50 mm glycine in phosphate-buffered saline (blocking buffer). Incubations with primary and secondary antibodies were performed at a 1:500 dilution in working buffer (1:5 dilution of blocking buffer) for 1–2 h at room temperature. Secondary antibodies were FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG for Group V sPLA2 antibody and Red X-conjugated anti-mouse IgG for caveolin-2 and COX-2 antibodies. Extensive washes in between incubations with antibodies were performed in phosphate-buffered saline. Specimens were mounted in anti-fade medium and viewed with a Bio-Rad MRC-1024 laser-scanning confocal system coupled to a Zeiss Axiovert 35M microscope.

The fluorescence of FITC was monitored at 488-nm argon excitation using a 522–535 nm band pass barrier filter whereas that of Red-X was monitored at 568-nm argon excitation using a 605–632 nm band pass barrier filter. The specificity of the anti-Group V PLA2 antibody was tested by using the antibody absorbed with the Group V PLA2 peptide used to obtain the rabbit anti-Group V PLA2 serum: ELKSMIEKVTGKNAFKNYG (16Bingham C.O.

To this end the Group V PLA2 peptide or a control peptide (CMETTPLNSQKVLSE) were conjugated to an agarose column (Hitrap affinity column, Amersham Biosciences), and the pass-through fraction of the Group V antibody (1:500 final dilution) was used for immunostaining. Construction of the Plasmid Encoding GFP-Group V sPLA2 (GFP-GV) and Production of Transfectants Stably Expressing GFP-GV—A cDNA fragment of human Group V sPLA2 having a native signal peptide at the N terminus was produced by PCR with HPLA2–10 (18Chen J.

The sense primer was 5′-TTGAGATCTGAGATGAAAGGCCTCCTCCCA-3′, the antisense primer 5′-AAAGAGATCTGGGAGCAGAGGATGTTGGG-3′. The PCR product of Group V PLA2 was digested with BglII and then subcloned into the BglII site in pEGFPN1 (Clontech). Approximately 5.5 μg of plasmids encoding GFP-GV or GFP (pEGFPN1) was mixed with 15 μl of TransIT™-LT1 (Panvera Co., Madison, WI) in 1000 μl of Opti-MEM for 10 min at room temperature and then added to the P388D1 cells (0.8 × 106 cells). After incubation at 37 °C for 4 h, the medium was replaced by the usual culture medium and incubated for an additional 12–18 h period. To obtain the GFP-GV or GFP stably expressing cells, the transfected cells were cloned by limiting dilution and kept in culture medium supplemented with 1 mg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen) using 96-well plates. After 2 weeks, wells containing a single colony were chosen for further expansion, and the fluorescence of the cells was examined under an epifluorescence microscope. Among the cell clones exhibiting GFP fluorescence, stable-transfectants for GFP-GV or GFP were selected by immunoblotting and PLA2 activity measurement. The stable cell lines were kept in culture in medium supplemented with 1 mg/ml Geneticin. Subcellular Distribution of Group V sPLA2 in LPS-treated Cells—Arm and co-workers (16Bingham C.O.

In unstimulated cells, confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed a diffuse pattern of cytoplasmic staining with anti-Group V sPLA2 antibody (Fig. 1).

The staining was ablated when the primary antibody was first absorbed out with the Group V PLA2 peptide antigen (see “Experimental Procedures”) as shown in Fig. 2, but not with a control peptide. A magnification of those granules can be observed in Fig. 3, where the perinuclear localization is evident. Fig. 4 shows the kinetics of Group V sPLA2 localization during exposure of the cells to LPS. An intense granular staining was already observed after 6 h of stimulation, increasing gradually with time. Staining was more prominent after 18 h of treatment (Fig. 4).Fig. 2Group V PLA2 antibody specificity. The cells were treated with LPS 100 ng/ml for 18 h, fixed, permeabilized, and treated with the antibody anti-Group V PLA2 absorbed to either a control peptide (A) or to the Group V PLA2 peptide used for immunization (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 3Magnification of Group V PLA2-stained granules.

The fusion protein was enzymatically active as judged by in vitro enzyme assay. 2Y. Shirai and E. A. Dennis, unpublished data. Control unstimulated cells (0 h stimulation) showed diffuse fluorescence in the cytoplasm, whereas exposure to LPS increased staining of cytoplasmic granular structures (Fig. 5A). These observations fully agree with the results shown in previous figures utilizing immunofluorescence. Control cells transfected only with GFP did not show those structures but a pattern of fluorescence evenly distributed across the cells, and no changes were observed after activation (Fig. 5B). To investigate the Group V sPLA2-containing granules in more detail, double antibody staining experiments were conducted in LPS-treated cells. Anti-Group V sPLA2 and anti-caveolin-2 antibodies revealed co-localization of both proteins in granules close to the nuclear envelope (Fig. 6), although it should be noted that not all of the Group V sPLA2 is associated with caveolin-2. In contrast to LPS-treated cells, unstimulated cells revealed a very poor staining with caveolin-2, 2Y. Shirai and E. A. Dennis, unpublished data. a finding that suggests up-regulation of caveolin-2 during cell activation, as previously reported for caveolin-1 in other macrophage cell lines (19Gargalovic P. Dory L. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 44: 11-21Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (84) Google Scholar). No cross-reactivity was found between the secondary antibody anti-rabbit IgG and the monoclonal antibody bound to caveolin-2, or between the secondary antibody anti-mouse IgG against the polyclonal antibody bound to Group V PLA2. LysoTracker or cathepsin D, markers for acidic granules, did not co-localize with Group V sPLA2, indicating that Group V-rich granules are not of lysosomal origin (data not shown). The co-localization of Group V sPLA2 and caveolin-2 into perinuclear granules suggests the possibility that the sPLA2 present in these granules comes from the outside of the cell via a caveolae-mediated endocytotic event or potocytosis, as previously suggested by others (11Murakami M. Koduri R.S. Enomoto A. Shimbara S. Seki M. Yoshihara K. Singer A. Valentin E. Ghomashchi F. Lambeau G. Gelb M.H. Kudo I. J. Biol.

To test this possibility, cellular treatment with LPS was conducted in the presence of heparin in the extracellular medium. Heparin, a cell-impermeable polysaccharide, tightly binds Group V sPLA2 in the incubation medium, thereby preventing the enzyme from interacting with the plasma membrane (8Shinohara H.

As a result of this action, heparin strongly blunts agonist-induced delayed AA mobilization in macrophages as well as other cells (20Murakami M. Kambe T. Shimbara S. Yamamoto S. Kuwata H. Kudo I. J.

The presence of heparin in the incubation medium drastically reduced the appearance of Group V sPLA2-containing perinuclear granules in LPS-activated cells (Fig. 7), suggesting an extracellular origin for those structures. Also, a side-by-side comparison of the effects of heparin on the co-localization of Group V sPLA2 with caveolin-2 in LPS-treated cells is shown in Fig. 8. Because in the presence of heparin no perinuclear sPLA2-containing granules are observed, no-colocalization between caveolin-2 and GV sPLA2 was detected.Fig. 8Effect of heparin on the colocalization of Group V sPLA2 with caveolin-2 in LPS-treated cells. The macrophages were treated with 100 ng/ml LPS for 18 h in the absence (A–C) or presence (D–F) of 1 mg/ml heparin.

It has been described that COX-2 localizes close to or by the nuclear envelope (23Spencer A.G. Woods J.W. Arakawa T. Singler I.I. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9886-9893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). We performed some experiments using antibodies against COX-2 to define the localization of this enzyme in LPS-treated cells. As shown in Fig. 9, COX-2 localizes in granules near the nucleus in close proximity to Group V PLA2. As indicated above, long term stimulation by LPS promotes activation of cPLA2, which leads to an early increase of free AA. Blocking cPLA2 activity with MAFP prevents PGE2 synthesis in LPS-treated cells, due to inhibition of the induction of Group V PLA2. Confocal microscopy experiments were performed in the LPS-treated cells in the presence of MAFP. As shown in Fig. 10, no perinuclear Group V PLA2-enriched granules were found under those conditions (Fig. 10, C and D). Ongoing studies in our laboratory for several years have delineated two pathways for AA release and metabolism in LPS-treated macrophages. The first one, referred to as the “primed immediate pathway” takes place in minutes and is elicited by the Ca2+-mobilizing agonist platelet-activating factor, but requires the cells to be exposed first to LPS for 1 h (4Balsinde J.

Overexpressed p57KIP2 also suppressed UV- and MEKK1-induced apoptotic cell death. p57KIP2 expression during C2C12 myoblast differentiation resulted in repression of the JNK activity stimulated by UV light. Furthermore, UV-stimulated JNK1 activity was higher in mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from p57–/– mice than in the cells from wild-type mice. Taken together, these findings suggest that p57KIP2 modulates stress-activated signaling by functioning as an endogenous inhibitor of JNK/SAPK. p57KIP2, a member of the Cip/Kip family of enzymes that inhibit several cyclin-dependent kinases, plays a role in many biological events including cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, tumorigenesis and developmental changes.

Enzymatic activities of CDKs are positively regulated by specific cyclins and negatively by CDK inhibitors (1Morgan D.O.

On the basis of structural and functional characteristics, CDK inhibitors can be grouped into two families (2Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3200) Google Scholar). The INK4 family, which includes p16INK4a, p15INK4b, p18INK4c, and p19INK4d, inhibits the cyclin D-dependent CDKs, CDK4 and CDK6. The Cip/Kip family, which includes p57KIP2, p21CIP1/WAF1, and p27Kip1, can inhibit all CDKs that regulate the G1/S-phase transition (2Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3200) Google Scholar, 3Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Curr. Opin. Genet.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 650-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). p57KIP2 and p27Kip1 also have unique carboxyl-terminal QT domains. The function of the QT domain is unclear. The human p57KIP2 gene, which encodes a 316-amino acid protein, is located in chromosome 11p15.5, a region implicated in sporadic cancers and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, a familial cancer syndrome (5Matsuoka S.

Interestingly, p57KIP2 null mice show altered cell proliferation and differentiation, apoptosis, and many other phenotypes that can be observed in patients with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (6Zhang P.

Thus, p57KIP2 has been implicated in the modulation of many cellular events including cell cycle control, differentiation, apoptosis, tumorigenesis, and development. However, the mechanism by which p57KIP2 exerts its modulatory functions is not yet fully understood. cyclin-dependent kinase 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole green fluorescent protein enhanced green fluorescent protein glutathione S-transferase hemagglutinin mouse embryonic fibroblast mitogen-activated protein kinase MAPK kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase MAPK/ERK kinase MEK kinase c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase stress-activated protein kinase terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling. cyclin-dependent kinase 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole green fluorescent protein enhanced green fluorescent protein glutathione S-transferase hemagglutinin mouse embryonic fibroblast mitogen-activated protein kinase MAPK kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase MAPK/ERK kinase MEK kinase c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase stress-activated protein kinase terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling. A variety of extracellular stimuli initiate intracellular signaling through the sequential protein phosphorylations leading to the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). The mammalian MAPK family includes several subgroups such as extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p38 MAPK, and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase (JNK/SAPK) (8Cobb M.H.

The JNK/SAPK signaling pathway is preferentially stimulated in cellular responses to a variety of stresses that include UV light, ionizing irradiation, DNA-damaging chemicals, reactive oxygen species, heat and osmotic shock, and metabolic inhibitors (9Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar, 10Minden A. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: F85-F104PubMed Google Scholar). The JNK/SAPK signaling cascade is composed of JNK/SAPK and its upstream kinases, MAPK kinases such as SEK1/JNKK1/MKK4 and MAPK kinase kinases such as MEKK1. Once activated, JNK/SAPK phosphorylates its cellular substrates, which include several transcription factors such as c-Jun, ATF2, and TCF/Elk-1, thereby enhancing their transcriptional activities (11Gupta S. Campbell D. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1333) Google Scholar, 12Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J.

Accordingly, JNK/SAPK has been implicated in the regulation of diverse cellular activities such as cell growth, transformation, survival, and death (9Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin.

JNK/SAPK activity has been shown to be modulated by other proteins through protein-protein interactions (14Park H.S. Lee J.S. Huh S.-H. Seo J.-S. Choi E.-J.

We previously reported that overexpressed p21CIP1/WAF1 binds and inhibits JNK/SAPK (15Shim J. Lee H. Park J. Kim H. Choi E.J. Nature. 1996; 381: 804-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated whether p57KIP2 can modulate the JNK/SAPK signaling pathway. Our findings indicate that p57KIP2 negatively regulates the JNK/SAPK signaling cascade through direct inhibition of JNK/SAPK, independently of its well known inhibitory function on CDKs. This new function of p57KIP2 on JNK/SAPK may be an important mechanism by which p57KIP2 can modulate the intracellular signaling events that mediate a variety of cellular activities including cell differentiation and survival. Plasmid Construction—The full-length human p57KIP2 (ATCC 99411) was subcloned into pcDNA3 (Clontech) and fused to GST in pGEX-4T-3 (Amersham Biosciences). The plasmids encoding GST fusion proteins of p57-(1–79), p57-(1–158), p57-(126–316), and p57-(238–316) were created by PCR amplification from a human p57KIP2 cDNA template and cloning in-frame into pGEX-4T. Cell Culture and Transfection—Human embryonic kidney HEK293, COS7, and HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. Mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells from wild-type mice and from p57 knockout mice were used between passage three and five (17Takahashi K. Nakayama K. Nakayama K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 127: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and they were in the same passage during the experiments. Myoblast C2C12 cells were routinely grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (growth medium). Where indicated, C2C12 cells were moved to a complete culture medium containing 2% fetal bovine serum (differentiation medium). Transfection of cultured cells was performed by the LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) or calcium phosphate method. Immune Complex Kinase Assay—Cultured cells were lysed in lysis buffer solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 12 mm glycerophosphate, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 3 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin. Cell extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation using the appropriate antibodies and analyzed for protein kinase activity by immune complex kinase assay (14Park H.S. Lee J.S. Huh S.-H. Seo J.-S. Choi E.-J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 446-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The antibodies used in the immune complex kinase assays were as follows: mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma), mouse monoclonal anti-HA (Roche Applied Science), rabbit polyclonal anti-p38 (Pharmingen), and rabbit polyclonal anti-ERK2 (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.). GST-c-Jun or GST-ATF2 fusion protein was used as substrate for JNK/SAPK, GST-ATF2 for p38, myelin basic protein for ERK2, and GST-SEK1 for MEKK1. Protein Kinase Assay for GST-SEK1—Cultured cells were transiently transfected with an expression vector pEBG encoding GST-SEK1. Cell lysates of the transfected cells were subjected to microcentrifugation at 4 °C for 10 min and solubilized with 1% Triton X-100. The soluble fraction was applied to glutathione-agarose beads, and GST-SEK1 was prepared as described previously (15Shim J. Lee H. Park J. Kim H. Choi E.J. Nature. 1996; 381: 804-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). GST-SEK1 eluted from the beads was assayed for SEK1 activity using GST-SAPKβ as substrate. Co-immunoprecipitation of JNK and p57KIP2—To test the physical association of endogenous p57KIP2 and JNK1 protein in intact cells, HeLa cells were lysed in buffer A containing 120 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm NaF, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1% digitonin. The lysates were then subjected to immunoprecipitation with the use of rabbit polyclonal anti-p57KIP2 antibody or rabbit pre-immune IgG. The resulting immunopellets were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 10% polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by immunoblot with mouse monoclonal anti-JNK1 antibody. To test the interactions of ectopically expressed proteins, HEK293 cells were transfected with pcDNA3 vectors encoding HA-JNK3/SAPKβ and p57KIP2. The transfected cells were lysed with buffer A, and the cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with the use of mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody or mouse preimmune IgG as the negative control. The immunopellets were analyzed by immunoblot probed with rabbit polyclonal anti-p57KIP2 antibody. In Vitro Binding Assay—GST fusion proteins were bacterially expressed using pGEX-4T vector. JNK1, JNK3/SAPKβ, p38, and ERK2 were in vitro translated in the presence of [35S]methionine using the TnT reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). 35S-Labeled proteins were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with GST fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads in 400 μl of binding buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate. After the beads were rinsed three times with washing buffer (1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Tween 20, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5), 35S-labeled proteins were eluted from the beads and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Apoptotic Cell Death—COS7 cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA3 empty vector, pcDNA3-p57KIP2, pcDNA3-Δ MEKK1, or pcDNA3-SEK(K129R) along with pEGFP. After 24 h of transfection, the cells were fixed with 70% ethanol, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). DAPI-stained nuclei were examined for apoptotic morphology with a Zeiss Axiovert fluorescence microscope. The percentage of GFP-expressing cells with apoptotic nuclei was determined from three independent dishes. TUNEL staining was performed using in situ cell death detection kit (Roche Applied Science) as described previously (14Park H.S. Lee J.S. Huh S.-H. Seo J.-S. Choi E.-J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 446-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). p57KIP2 Inhibits JNK/SAPK Activity in Intact Cells—To investigate whether p57KIP2 could modulate the JNK signaling pathway, we examined the effect of p57KIP2 on JNK activity in intact cells. We transfected HEK293 cells with plasmids encoding p57KIP2 and JNK1 and induced JNK stimulation by exposing transfected cells to UV light (Fig. 1). Our data indicate that ectopic p57KIP2 inhibited the UV-stimulated activity of JNK1 (Fig. 1A) or SAPKβ/JNK3 (data not shown), whereas it did not affect either the UV-stimulated p38 MAPK activity or the phorbol ester-stimulated ERK2 activity (Fig. 1A). Because the JNK signaling system comprises JNK and its upstream kinases, which include a MAPK kinase such as SEK1/MKK4/JNKK1 and a MAPK kinase kinase such as MEKK1, we decided to examine whether p57KIP2 would also inhibit SEK1 or MEKK1 activity. HEK293 cells were transfected with plasmid encoding GST-SEK1, and then the transfected cells were unexposed or exposed to UV light. UV irradiation enhanced the kinase activity of GST-SEK1 in the cells (Fig. 1B). Co-expressed p57KIP2 did not affect the UV-stimulated GST-SEK1 activity. Similarly, p57KIP2 also did not affect the UV-induced stimulation of MKK7, which is another MAPK kinase upstream of JNK (data not shown). We looked next for a possible effect of p57KIP2 on MEKK1 activity (Fig. 1C). HEK293 cells transfected with plasmid expressing MEKK1 showed high enzymatic activity of MEKK1 even without any further treatment, and ectopic p57KIP2 did not alter the MEKK1 activity. A separate transfection study also indicated that p57KIP2 did not affect the UV-stimulated MEKK1 activity (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that p57KIP2 suppresses the JNK/SAPK signaling pathway through acting on a site or sites downstream of MAPK kinase, probably JNK itself. p57KIP2 Physically Interacts with JNK—In the following experiments, we tested whether p57KIP2 could interact with JNK/SAPK. An in vitro binding study using in vitro translated 35S-labeled protein kinase proteins revealed that GST-p57KIP2 protein directly interacted with 35S-labeled JNK1 and SAPKβ/JNK3 but not with 35S-labeled ERK2 or p38 (Fig. 2A). Next we examined the physical association of p57KIP2 and JNK in HEK293 cells after co-transfecting the cells with plasmids encoding p57KIP2 and HA-JNK1 (Fig. 2B). The transfected HEK293 cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibody, and the resulting immunoprecipitates were subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-p57KIP2 antibody. The immunoblot data showed that HA-JNK1 physically associated with p57KIP2 in the transfected cells. We also examined the physical interaction between endogenous p57KIP2 and endogenous JNK1 in HeLa cells. HeLa cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with the use of anti-p57KIP2 antibody. Immunoblot analysis using anti-JNK1 antibody of the p57KIP2 immunoprecipitates revealed that endogenous JNK1 physically interacted with endogenous p57KIP2 (Fig. 2C). Next, we examined the effect of p57KIP2 on the interaction between JNK1 and c-Jun, a substrate of JNK1, in intact cells. Co-immunoprecipitation data showed that the physical interaction between JNK1 and c-Jun markedly decreased in the cells expressing p57KIP2 (Fig. 3). These results thus suggest that 57KIP2, by binding JNK1, inhibits an interaction between JNK1 and c-Jun. The QT Domain of p57KIP2 Is Involved in Inhibition of JNK— Next, we investigated the in vitro effects of p57KIP2 and p57KIP2 variants on JNK activity. An in vitro kinase study showed that recombinant GST-p57KIP2 inhibited JNK1 activity, whereas the GST control protein did not affect the kinase activity (Fig. 4A). GST-p57-(126–316) and GST-p57-(238–316) also inhibited JNK1 activity, whereas GST-p57-(1–79) and GST-p57-(1–158) did not. In comparison, GST-p57-(238–316) did not inhibit CDK2 activity in vitro, whereas GST-p57-(1–79) did (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that p57KIP2 inhibits JNK and CDK2 by distinct mechanisms and that the carboxyl-terminal QT domain of p57KIP2 is crucial for JNK inhibition. Transfection studies using HEK293 cells also showed that UV-stimulated JNK1 activity was inhibited by ectopically expressed p57 (238–316) but not by p57 (1–79) (data not shown). GST-p57KIP2 protein was not phosphorylated in vitro by JNK1 (data not shown). p57KIP2 Suppresses JNK-involved Apoptosis—The JNK/SAPK signaling pathway has been shown to be involved in the mechanism of apoptosis (9Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar, 18Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E.

Chem. 1996; 271: 31929-31936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether ectopic p57KIP2 could suppress the JNK-involved apoptosis (Fig. 5). First, we examined the effect of p57KIP2 on apoptosis induced by expression of ΔMEKK1, a constitutively active mutant of MEKK1 (Fig. 5A). Apoptotic cell death was enhanced in HEK293 cells expressing ΔMEKK1, and ΔMEKK1-induced apoptosis was reduced when SEK1(K129R) was co-expressed. These data suggest that ΔMEKK1 induces apoptotic cell death through the MEKK1-SEK1-JNK signaling cascade. ΔMEKK1-induced apoptosis was suppressed in cells expressing ectopic p57KIP2. Because p57KIP2 does not inhibit either MEKK1 or SEK1 activity (Fig. 1), these results suggest that JNK inhibition is the major mechanism by which p57KIP2 suppresses JNK-mediated apoptosis. Next, we examined the effect of p57KIP2 on UV-induced apoptosis. The DAPI staining data indicated that exposure of HEK293 cells to UV light resulted in a marked increase in apoptotic cell death (Fig. 5B). The UV-induced apoptosis was decreased in cells expressing SEK1(K129R), a dominant-negative mutant of SEK1, suggesting that the JNK signaling cascade was involved in the mechanism of UV-induced apoptosis. We found that cells transfected with plasmid encoding p57KIP2 became more resistant to UV radiation than cells transfected with control plasmid. TUNEL staining data showed similar results (Fig. 5C). Depletion of Endogenous p57KIP2 Enhances Kinase Activity of Endogenous JNK in Intact Cells—Recently it has been shown that expression of p57KIP2 is enhanced during C2C12 myoblast differentiation (20Reynaud E.G. Pelpel K. Guillier M. Leibovitch M.P. Leibovitch S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7621-7629Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), which can be induced by withdrawing serum from the culture medium. We therefore tested whether the induction of p57KIP2 expression by serum withdrawal would result in suppression of JNK activity in C2C12 myoblast cells. We confirmed a dramatic induction of p57KIP2 expression in C2C12 cells after reducing the serum concentration from 20% (growth medium) to 2% (differentiation medium; data not shown). We then measured JNK1 activity in undifferentiated and differentiated C2C12 cells (Fig. 6). Our data show that the UV-stimulated JNK1 activity was inhibited in C2C12 cells in differentiation medium, compared with C2C12 cells in growth medium (Fig. 6A). The immunoblot data revealed the induction of p57KIP2 expression in the cells in differentiation medium. To further examine whether p57KIP2 induction was responsible for the inhibition of JNK activity during C2C12 cell differentiation, we constructed C2C12 cells that were stably transfected with p57KIP2 antisense vector. Expression of p57KIP2 protein was markedly reduced in the C2C12 cells harboring the p57KIP2 antisense compared with control cells that were stably transfected with the empty vector alone (Fig. 6B). Our data thus indicate that suppression of p57KIP2 expression prevents the inhibitory action of p57KIP2 on UV-stimulated JNK1 activity. To further investigate the biological relevance of the inhibitory action of p57 on JNK activity, we examined the UV-stimulated activity of endogenous JNK1 in MEF cells derived from p57+/+ and p57–/– mice. The JNK1 activity at the UV-stimulated state was higher in MEFp57(–/–) cells than in MEFp57(+/+) cells (Fig. 7). Thus, these results suggest that p57KIP2 is an endogenous inhibitor of JNK/SAPK. We have demonstrated here that p57KIP2 can modulate stress-activated signaling through negatively regulating the JNK/SAPK pathway. p57KIP2 appears to suppress the JNK signaling pathway by targeting JNK. p57KIP2 did not affect other MAPK family members such as ERK and p38. p57KIP2 physically associates with and inhibits JNK in intact cells. Thus we show in this study that p57KIP2 functions as a natural inhibitory protein of JNK/SAPK, independently of its inhibitory action on CDKs. p57KIP2 contains the NH2-terminal CDK binding domain, the PAPA domain, and the carboxyl-terminal QT domain (4Lee M.H. Reynisdottir I. Massague J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar, 5Matsuoka S. Edwards M.C. Bai C. Parker S. Zhang P. Baldini A. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 650-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). p57 shares sequence homology with other members of the p21 family, p21 and p27, in the NH2-terminal CDK binding domain (4Lee M.H. Reynisdottir I. Massague J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar, 5Matsuoka S. Edwards M.C. Bai C. Parker S. Zhang P. Baldini A. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 650-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal QT domain of p57KIP2 also exhibits sequence similarity to that region in p27. Although the function of the QT domain of p57KIP2 remains unclear, this domain is thought to be involved in protein-protein interaction (5Matsuoka S. Edwards M.C. Bai C. Parker S. Zhang P. Baldini A. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 650-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). Our present data show that a carboxyl-terminal p57KIP2 fragment containing the QT domain is crucial for the inhibition of JNK/SAPK. Interestingly, p27, which also contains the QT domain in its carboxyl-terminal region, failed to inhibit JNK/SAPK activity in vitro (data not shown). The difference between the actions of p57KIP2 and p27 on JNK/SAPK may be due to a relatively low level (about 35%) of amino acid sequence identity between these QT domains. In humans, the p57KIP2 gene is located in chromosome 11p15.5, a region implicated in both sporadic cancers and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, a familial cancer syndrome (5Matsuoka S. Edwards M.C. Bai C. Parker S. Zhang P. Baldini A. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 650-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). Among patients with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, several mutations in the p57KIP2 gene have been detected that include deletions in the QT domain of p57KIP2 (21Hatada I. Nabetani A. Morisaki H. Xin Z. Ohishi S. Tonoki H. Niikawa N. Inoue M. Komoto Y. Okada A. Steichen E. Ohashi H. Fukushima Y. Nakayama M. Mukai T. Hum.

Mukai T. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 171-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). A deletion in the QT domain of p57KIP2 may possibly help JNK/SAPK escape from negative regulation by p57KIP2. The resultant increase in JNK/SAPK activity may thus contribute to oncogenic transformation (9Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar, 23Behrens A. Jochum W. Sibilia M. Wagner E.F. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2657-2663Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Previous studies using p57KIP2 knockout mice reported an increase in apoptosis and altered differentiation during mouse development (6Zhang P. Liegeois N.J. Wong C. Finegold M. Hou H. Thompson J.C. Silverman A. Harper J.W. DePinho R.A. Elledge S.J. Nature. 1997; 387: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar, 7Yan Y. Frisen J. Lee M.H. Massague J. Barbacid M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 973-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). p57KIP2 protein also plays a role in the regulation of myoblast differentiation and apoptotic processes (20Reynaud E.G. Pelpel K. Guillier M. Leibovitch M.P. Leibovitch S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7621-7629Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 24Zhang P. Wong C. Liu D. Finegold M. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that JNK/SAPK signaling pathway may be involved in the regulatory mechanism of apoptosis and differentiation (9Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar, 10Minden A. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: F85-F104PubMed Google Scholar, 25Nagata Y. Todokoro K.

It is plausible, therefore, to conclude that JNK/SAPK inhibition could be an important mechanism by which p57KIP2 exerts its functions on apoptosis and differentiation. Further studies are needed to verify this possibility. On the basis of our data, we suggest a novel function for p57KIP2, that it may regulate stress-activated signals by suppressing the JNK/SAPK signaling pathway. We thank Drs. R. J. Davis, J. W.

By use of spectrophotometric assays based on the oxidation of NAD(P)H and formation of [Fe(II) (1,10-phenanthroline)3]2+ as well as by utilizing electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometry, it was demonstrated that the NAD(P)H-dependent flavoenzyme lipoyl dehydrogenase (diaphorase, EC 1.8.1.4) effectively catalyzes the one-electron reduction of Fe(III) complexes of citrate, ATP, and ADP at the expense of the co-enzymes NAD(P)H. Deactivated or inhibited lipoyl dehydrogenase did not reduce the Fe(III) complexes. Likewise, in the absence of NAD(P)H or in the presence of NAD(P)+, Fe(III) reduction could not be detected. The fact that reduction also occurred in the absence of molecular oxygen as well as in the presence of superoxide dismutase proved that the Fe(III) reduction was directly linked to the enzymatic activity of lipoyl dehydrogenase and not mediated by O2·¯.

The present data suggest a (patho)physiological role for lipoyl dehydrogenase and other flavoenzymes in intracellular iron metabolism. The biological importance of iron is substantially based on the fact that the function of numerous cellular proteins is coupled to the intramolecular presence of this transition metal. By far, the largest part of the intracellular iron is tightly bound to different proteins (e.g. ferritin or heme proteins), which are distributed over the variety of the intracellular compartments. However, a small part (0.2–3%) of the cellular iron constitutes “iron in transit,” which is complexed to low molecular weight organic chelators of relatively low affinities for iron ions, e.g. citric acid, amino acids, sugars, ascorbate, ADP, ATP, and other nucleotides or is loosely associated to proteins or membrane lipids (1Breuer W.

This fraction constitutes the metabolically and catalytically reactive iron of the cell and is commonly termed “labile iron pool” or “chelatable iron pool” (5Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C.

In contrast to the iron bound in iron storage or functional proteins, iron in transit has a substantial cytotoxic potential. This cytotoxicity is mainly related to the fact that it catalyzes the formation of hydroxyl radicals (•OH) from hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, Reaction 1 (11Fenton H.J.H. J. Chem. Soc. 1894; 65: 899-910Crossref Google Scholar, 12Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. 3rd Ed.

Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. 3rd Ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford1999Google Scholar). Consequently, such reactive oxygen species-mediated, iron-dependent injurious processes are considered to be crucial pathogenetic factors for numerous diseases (5Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C.

At least a small fraction of the iron in transit must exist within the ferrous (Fe(II) oxidation state, which is the basis for the numerous metabolic functions of iron (e.g. in mitochondrial heme synthesis) but also for the participation in deleterious radical-generating reactions.

The intracellular maintenance of the Fe(II) oxidation state requires the presence of effective Fe(III)-reducing equivalents within the cell in order to counteract several (patho)physiological oxidizing processes, e.g. rapid reduction of molecular oxygen or H2O2 (5Halliwell B.

In recent studies ascorbic acid and glutathione, as well as NAD(P)H, α-keto acids, ferredoxin, O2·¯, and thioredoxin have been regarded as the intracellular reductants for Fe(III) (5Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 1-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (4442) Google Scholar, 6Petrat F. de Groot H. Sustmann R. Rauen U. Biol. Chem.

More recently, however, doubt arose whether these “classical” reductants are really responsible for the intracellular reduction of the metabolically and catalytically reactive iron, at least under certain conditions. It has been proposed that as yet unidentified NAD(P)H-dependent redox enzymes can effectively reduce ferric ions to the ferrous state (23Woodmansee A.N. Imlay J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34055-34066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). More than 1 decade ago, Shi and Dalal (27Shi X. Dalal N.S. FEBS Lett. 1990; 276: 189-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) demonstrated that lipoyl dehydrogenase, a NAD(P)H-dependent flavoenzyme that often is denominated as diaphorase (26Massey V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1960; 37: 314-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), is able to catalyze the one electron reduction of Cr(IV) and V(V). Until now, however, the ability of this enzyme to reduce Fe(III) ions complexed to physiological ligands has not been studied, which is more surprising as lipoyl dehydrogenase has been reported to reduce the biochemical standard one-electron oxidant [Fe(CN)6]3–very rapidly (26Massey V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1960; 37: 314-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In the present work, we therefore utilized spectrophotometric techniques based on the oxidation of NAD(P)H and on the Fe(II) chelator 1,10-phenanthroline as well as EPR spectrometry to study whether lipoyl dehydrogenase (EC 1.8.1.4) from Clostridium kluyveri and from porcine heart is able to reduce Fe(III) ions of the labile iron pool. The ability of other NAD(P)H-dependent flavoenzymes (i.e. glutathione reductase, EC 1.6.4.2; cytochrome c reductase, EC 1.6.99.3; and cytochrome P450 reductase, EC 1.6.2.4) to reduce Fe(III) was studied for comparison. As both the reduction potential of Fe(III) and the kinetics of enzymatic iron reduction (may) largely depend on the (chelating) ligands bound to the Fe(III) center, comparative studies were performed with ferric iron ions coordinated to a variety of common intracellular low molecular weight iron ligands, namely citrate, ADP, and ATP. Chemicals—Citric acid trisodium salt (dihydrate) and l-ascorbic acid were obtained from Merck; ADP was from Fluka (Neu-Ulm, Germany); and catalase (6500 units mg–1 protein, from beef liver), ATP, NADH, NADPH, glutathione reductase (EC 1.6.4.2; 150 units mg–1 protein; from yeast), and aldehyde dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.5; 41.2 units mg–1 protein; from yeast) were from Roche Applied Science.

Acta. 1960; 37: 314-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) oxidizes 1 μmol of β-NADH min–1 (at pH 7.5, 25 °C) with the corresponding reduction of the electron acceptor 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol as defined by the manufacturer. Concentrations of lipoyl dehydrogenase and of the other (flavo)enzymes were calculated on the basis of their molecular masses as follows: lipoyl dehydrogenase, 100,000 Da (28Massey V. Hofmann T.

Comparative measurements were performed using identical enzyme side concentrations (= enzyme concentration × active sides). All gas mixtures were delivered by Messer Griesheim (Oberhausen, Germany). 3,3′-methylene-bis(4-hydroxycoumarin) 1,5-methoxyindole-2-carboxylic acid ethyl ester superoxide dismutase 1,3-bis(chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea. Preparation of Fe(III) and Fe(II) Complexes—Concentrated stock solutions of the Fe(III)-chelating ligands ATP, ADP, and citrate (1–100 mm each) were prepared with Tris buffer (10–100 mm, pH 7.4, 25 °C) that had been pretreated with Chelex 100 (33Evans P.J. Halliwell B. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 82-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 34Petrat F. Rauen U. de Groot H. Hepatology. 1999; 29: 1171-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) in order to minimize contamination by transition metal ions. Stock solutions of Fe(III) complexes (100-fold) were prepared by mixing FeCl3 (200 mm dissolved in double-distilled water) with a 6- (ATP and ADP) or 10-fold (citrate) molar excess of aqueous solutions of the ligands. In some experiments, the ligands were directly added from their stock solutions to the buffer solution (10–100 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4), and then an aqueous solution of FeCl3 was added to give the above molar ratios. By this means precipitation of Fe(III) as insoluble Fe(III)-oxyhydroxide polymers at neutral pH was avoided. In some experiments a Fe(III)-citrate complex was used instead of preparing the iron-citrate complex described above. This complex was dissolved in Tris buffer by gentle heating to give a 100-fold stock solution. Fe(II) stock solutions were prepared by dissolving ferrous ammonium sulfate (1 mm) in an aqueous solution of citric acid trisodium salt dihydrate (1 mm). Complete reduction of the complexed iron ions was achieved by incubation with 20 mm ascorbate for 30 min (35Petrat F. de Groot H. Rauen U. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 376: 74-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and confirmed by using the FOX assay (36Wolff S.P. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 182-189Crossref Scopus (1069) Google Scholar). From this stock solution Fe(II) standards were prepared, which were used in the 1,10-phenanthroline-based Fe(II) assay described below. All stock solutions of the iron complexes were freshly prepared and used within 5 h; all molarities are expressed in terms of the iron content. Recording of NADH Oxidation—All experiments in this study were performed using Chelex 100-treated Tris buffer (see above). Phosphate buffers, although often used in studies on lipoyl dehydrogenase activity, appeared not to be suitable here for the following reasons. Phosphate is known to complex Fe(III) and consequently may compete with the Fe(III) ligands studied here. Because phosphate complexes Fe(III) better than Fe(II), it promotes Fe(II) autoxidation (37Cher M. Davidson N. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1955; 77: 793-798Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 38Reinke L.A. Moore D.R. Rau J.M. McCay P.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 758-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Furthermore, on mixing of ferric phenanthroline with phosphate buffer, formation of a precipitate has been reported (39Funkhouser E.A. Ackermann R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 66: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), which would affect the 1,10-phenanthroline-based assay for Fe(II) as used here (see below). In contrast to phosphate buffer, imidazole buffer has been reported to strongly diminish the rate of Fe(II) oxidation (40Jonas S.K. Riley P.A. Cell Biochem. Funct. 1991; 9: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and thus would likewise influence redox reactions of iron ions. As virtually all buffer agents contain functional groups with the potential to coordinate to iron ions, thereby affecting their redox potential, the concentration of the Tris buffer used here was kept low (10–100 mm). In experiments performed under normoxic conditions, NADH (200 μm) was added from a concentrated stock solution to a quartz cuvette containing Chelex 100-treated Tris buffer (10–100 mm, pH 7.4, 25 °C). NADH oxidation was recorded by monitoring its UV/visible absorption at 340 nm (UV/Visible Lambda 40, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using Tris buffer as blank. After recording the NADH base-line absorption for 5 min at 0.1-min intervals, lipoyl dehydrogenase from either C. kluyveri or porcine heart was added, and the absorption measurements were resumed. Afterward, the various Fe(III) complexes were added from their stock solutions to give the concentrations given under “Results.” In experiments performed under hypoxic conditions, Tris buffer (6 ml) containing NADH (5–200 μm) and either ATP, ADP, or citrate (0.06–20.0 mm) was transferred to a reaction tube and continuously bubbled with argon by means of a cannula piercing the rubber stopper of the reaction tube. Afterward, Fe(III) (0.01–2.0 mm; as FeCl3) was added using a Hamilton syringe (see above). After equilibration of the Fe(III) complexes (optical check), an aliquot (1 ml) of the reaction mixture was transferred with a Hamilton syringe to an argon-flushed quartz cuvette, and the recording of the absorption was started. After recording of the background absorption (E340) of the sample, lipoyl dehydrogenase from either C. kluyveri or porcine heart (0.39 μm) or, for comparison, cytochrome P450 reductase, glutathione reductase, cytochrome c reductase, or aldehyde dehydrogenase, which is no flavoenzyme and served as control, was added to the reaction tube. NADH absorption was recorded from aliquots repetitively sampled from the reaction tube at different time points. Immediately after a sample had been transferred to the cuvette, 2% SDS was added to the cuvette in order to terminate the enzymatic reaction. NADH oxidation was quantified from changes at E340 using a calibration curve. Rates of NADH oxidation (μm min–1) were evaluated from the initial (i.e. within the first 10 min) decrease of E340 after addition of the (flavo)enzymes in order to ensure that enzymatic activity was not underestimated due to significant changes in substrate concentrations. Further experiments with lipoyl dehydrogenase were performed in the presence of superoxide dismutase (SOD, 500 units ml–1) or catalase (500 units ml–1) or with NADPH instead of NADH. In some experiments enzymatic activity of lipoyl dehydrogenase was inhibited by preincubation (30 min) of the enzyme with the inhibitors 3,3′-methylene-bis(4-hydroxycoumarin) (dicumarol, 200 μm (41Karczewski J.M. Peters J.G.P. Noordhoek J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 57: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 42Dinkova-Kostova A.T. Talalay P. Free Radic. Biol.

Med. 1997; 22: 535-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar)), or 1,3-bis(chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU, 300 μm (45Becker K. Schirmer R.H. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 251: 173-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar)). Determination of Fe(II) Formation Using Spectrophotometry—Fe(II) formation was determined by using an assay based on complexation with the strong iron chelator 1,10-phenanthroline (46Hardwick T.J. Can. J. Chem. 1957; 35: 428-436Crossref Google Scholar). 1,10-Phenanthroline has a much higher binding affinity (apparent binding constant, Kapp) for Fe(II) (log Kapp = 21.0 (47Smith R.M. Martell A.E. Critical Stability Constants. Vol. 2. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1990: 251-252Google Scholar)) than for Fe(III) (log Kapp = 14.1 (47Smith R.M. Martell A.E. Critical Stability Constants. Vol. 2. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1990: 251-252Google Scholar)). In the presence of Fe(II) the chelator forms the red colored tris-o-phenanthroline-Fe(II) ion [Fe(II) (1,10-phenanthroline)3]2+ with a characteristic absorption maximum at 510 nm, whereas the Fe(III)-1,10-phenanthroline complex hardly absorbs at this wavelength (46Hardwick T.J. Can. J. Chem. 1957; 35: 428-436Crossref Google Scholar). Because of the rapid autoxidation of Fe(II) in the presence of O2, Fe(II) formation was assessed in the absence of oxygen similarly as described above for the determination of lipoyl dehydrogenase-mediated NADH oxidation. After incubation of the various Fe(III) complexes with either lipoyl dehydrogenase or cytochrome P450 reductase, glutathione reductase, cytochrome c reductase, or aldehyde dehydrogenase in the presence of NAD(P)H, repetitively sampled aliquots from the reaction tube were transferred to a cuvette containing 2% SDS. Then 1,10-phenanthroline (1 mm; stock solutions 0.1 m in 100 volume % ethanol) was added, and the absorption of the [Fe(II) (1,10-phenanthroline)3]2+ complex was determined at 510 nm. The concentration of the Fe(II) formed was calculated from the absorption using a calibration curve obtained from 1,10-phenanthroline (1 mm) and Fe(II) standard solutions prepared from ferrous ammonium sulfate and ascorbate (see above). Rates of Fe(II) formation (μm min–1) were determined from the initial increase of E510 after addition of lipoyl dehydrogenase and the other (flavo)enzymes, respectively. All values were corrected for background absorption, monitored in the absence of 1,10-phenanthroline. Further experiments with lipoyl dehydrogenase were performed in the presence of SOD (500 units ml–1) and catalase (500 units ml–1) or with NAD+ or NADPH, respectively, instead of NADH. Quantification of Fe(II) using 1,10-phenanthroline was neither affected by the presence of the organic ligands (ATP, ADP, and citrate) nor by the presence of the flavoenzymes or SDS. Kinetic properties of Fe(III) reduction mediated by lipoyl dehydrogenase, cytochrome P450 reductase, glutathione reductase, or cytochrome c reductase, respectively, as well as enzyme-mediated NAD(P)H oxidation were calculated with GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Determination of the Redox State of Iron Ions Using EPR Spectrometry—Because (high spin) Fe(III) generally shows a characteristic, easily detectable EPR signal (48Pilbrow J.R. Transition Metal Ion Electron Paramagnetic Resonance. Clarendon Press, Oxford1990: 135-144Google Scholar), EPR spectrometry is a widely used method to study Fe(III) reduction by recording the decrease in signal intensity to a broad and indistinct high spin or EPR-silent low spin Fe(II) signal (23Woodmansee A.N. Imlay J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34055-34066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 49Kozlov A.V. Yegorov D.Y. Vladimirov Y.A. Azizova O.A. Free Radic. Biol.

Med. 1993; 15: 565-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed in the strict absence of molecular oxygen in order to avoid the following: (i) one-electron reduction of O2 to O2·¯ (which itself is a reductant for Fe(III)) by the flavin moiety of porcine heart lipoyl dehydrogenase (see below); (ii) rapid reoxidation of Fe(II) by molecular oxygen; and (iii) formation of insoluble Fe(III)-oxyhydroxide polymers at the concentrations required for EPR spectroscopy. In order to obtain Fe(III) EPR signals with a sufficiently low signal-to-noise ratio, relatively high concentrations of Fe(III) (1 mm) were employed. EPR spectra were recorded at 77 K on a Bruker ESP-300E X-band spectrometer (Bruker, Rheinstetten, Germany) equipped with a TM110 wide bore cavity. The instrument settings used were as follows: microwave frequency, 9.53 GHz; modulation, 10 G; signal gain, 2.5 × 104; sweep range, 2000; sweep time, 6 min; modulation frequency, 100 kHz. Chelex 100-treated Tris buffer (5 ml, 100 mm, pH 7.4, 25 °C) was transferred to a reaction tube and continuously bubbled with argon to remove oxygen (see above). Then NADH (10 mm) and either ATP, ADP (both 6 mm), or citrate (10 mm) was added from concentrated stock solutions followed by addition of 1 mm Fe(III) (as FeCl3, dissolved in double-distilled water) using a Hamilton syringe. The solution was incubated until complex formation between Fe(III) and the ligands became visually evident from the disappearance of an initially formed white precipitate (in case of ATP and ADP) or from the appearance of a yellow color (in case of citrate), respectively. Then an aliquot (0.5 ml) of the reaction mixtures was quickly transferred to an argon-flushed Suprasil quartz tube (4 mm outer diameter) using a Hamilton syringe. The quartz tube was immediately immersed in a liquid nitrogen Dewar insert, and EPR measurements were started. After having recorded the base signal of the Fe(III) complexes, lipoyl dehydrogenase from either C. kluyveri (1.93 μm) or porcine heart (9.65 μm) was added from concentrated stock solutions to the reaction tube to start the enzymatic reaction. Aliquots (0.5 ml) were repetitively sampled from the reaction tube and frozen to 77 K at the time points given under “Results,” and the EPR signals of Fe(III) were recorded. In some experiments reduced glutathione (5 mm) or ascorbate (2 mm) instead of lipoyl dehydrogenase was used as reductant. Similar experiments were performed in the presence of SOD (500 units ml–1) or catalase (500 units ml–1). In another series of experiments, lipoyl dehydrogenase instead of NADH was added to the reaction mixture, and the reaction was started by addition of NADH. In further control experiments NADH was replaced by NAD+ or NADPH, respectively. Spectra were evaluated with the Bruker Win-EPR software and plotted using SigmaPlot 8.0 (SPSS Inc.). Statistics—All experiments were repeated at least twice. Traces shown in the figures are representative of all the corresponding experiments performed. The data are expressed as means ± S.D. Effect of Lipoyl Dehydrogenase on NADH Oxidation in the Presence of Fe(III) Complexes—In order to assess whether physiological Fe(III) complexes (Fe(III)-ATP, -ADP, and -citrate) may act as electron acceptors in an NADH-dependent lipoyl dehydrogenase reaction, we studied the effect of the complexes on NADH oxidation by spectrophotometric recordings of NADH absorption at 340 nm under normoxic conditions. Addition of all Fe(III) complexes (60 μm) to Chelex 100-treated Tris buffer (25 °C, pH 7.4) containing 0.39 μm lipoyl dehydrogenase from C. kluyveri and NADH (200 μm) led to a rapid and linear decrease in NADH absorption (Fig. 1), ind"

The glue-like property of sericin is attributed to the hydrogen bonding between serine residues of sericin with serine residues in the fibroin structural components of silk fiber. Silk of Bombyx mori is composed of two kinds of proteins: the fibroin which is synthesized in the posterior silk gland and the sericins produced by the middle silk gland. The sericins bind two fibroin fibers together in the anterior region of the gland as the fibers are spun to form the cocoon. Sericins represent a family of proteins whose molecular mass ranges from 20 to 310 kDa (2Kaplan D. Adams W.W. Farmer B. Viney C. Silk Polymers: Materials Science and Biotechnology.

Two genes encode sericins, Ser1 and Ser2 (5Okamoto H. Ishikawa E. Suzuki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 15192-15199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Michaille J.J. Garel A. Prudhomme J.C.

Some conformation studies with sericins from the silk gland of B. mori or regenerated sericin from B. mori cocoons suggested random coil with some β structure (9Tsukada M. Komoto T. Kawai T. Polymer.

However, the samples used in these studies were mixtures of the various native sericin proteins, therefore the structure of the individual proteins is unknown and the contribution of specific sequences toward secondary structure is not confirmed.

The ability of poly(l-serine) to fold into a β conformation depended on molecular weight. Low molecular weight poly(l-serine) (molecular weight 650) was soluble and adopted a random coil conformation in aqueous solution, whereas high molecular weight poly(l-serine) (molecular weight 105,000) formed β-sheets and was insoluble in water (11Tooney N.M. Fasman G.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 36: 355-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, homopolypeptides like poly(l-serine) do not match native sericin in terms of amino acid composition, sequence, and molecular weight. Therefore, to better understand sericin structure, interactions between sericin and fibroin, and the biological relevance of sericin in fiber structure, high molecular weight pure sericin-like proteins are required. Sericin 1 encoded by Ser 1 consists of 70 repeats of the 38-amino acid motif (5Okamoto H. Ishikawa E. Suzuki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 15192-15199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar): SSTGSSSNTDSNSNSVGSSTSGGSSTYGYSSNSRDGSV. The molecular mass of sericin 1 proteins is 76-284 kDa. The 38-amino acid repeat motif exhibits a high content of hydrophilic amino acids: 44.7% serine, 10.5% threonine, and 7.9% tyrosine, very close to the average amino acid composition of sericin (4Lucas F. Rudall K.M. Comprehensive Biochemistry, Vol. 26B, 475-558. Elsevier Science Publishers, Amsterdam1968Google Scholar): 38.1% serine, 7.5% threonine, and 4.7% tyrosine. Hence, a sericin-like protein can be synthesized based on this 38-amino acid motif. Proteins derived from genetic engineering are characterized by control over composition, sequence, molecular weight, and stereochemical purity. Motifs of silkworm and spider silk proteins have been studied in a similar manner to understand structures in different environments, and spider silk proteins have been modified for the purpose of controlled assembly (17Prince J.T.

Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and Congo red (CR) staining to gain insight into the structure and assembly of this protein. Materials—Oligonucleotides coding for the sericin 38-mer repeat from sericin 1 were purchased from MWG-Biotech (High Point, NC). All restriction enzymes, calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase, T4 polynucleotide kinase, T4 DNA ligase, DNA ladders, and pUC19 were purchased from New England Biolab (NEB, Beverly, MA). Qiagen (Valencia, CA) plasmid miniprep kits were used to purify plasmid from transformed cells. Qiagen MinElute extraction kits and MinElute gel extraction kits were used to purify DNA fragment from agarose gels. Qiagen MinElute reaction cleanup kits were used to purify ligated oligonucleotide and digested plasmid. The Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA)-agarose resin was purchased from Qiagen. Slide-A-Lyzer dialysis cassettes were purchased from Pierce. Library efficiency DH5α™ and MAX efficiency Stbl2™ competent cells were purchased from Invitrogen. Kanamycin, ethidium bromide, urea, and imidazole were purchased from Sigma. Other chemicals with the highest grade of purity were purchased from Fisher. Construction of Synthetic B. mori Sericin Motif DNA—Two sense and two antisense oligonucleotides of about 70 base (Fig. 1) were synthesized on a 0.05 μmol scale. After phosphorylation the complementary oligonucleotides were annealed by heating at 95 °C for 5 min and cooling slowly to room temperature. The two sets of annealed oligonucleotides were ligated to form one oligonucleotide monomer building block that was 132 nucleotides long encoding the sericin 38 amino acid motif. The ligated oligonucleotide was purified by Qiagen MinElute reaction clean up kit and ligated into BamHI-digested and -dephosphorylated vector pUC19. Five microliters of the ligation reaction was transformed into 100 μl Library efficiency DH5α™ competent cells. Recombinant plasmid was identified by DNA sequencing with forward and reverse M13 primers. The obtained clone was named pUC19-SRC1. Construction of Multimeric B. mori Sericin Motif DNA—The recombinant pUC19-SRC1 was digested with XhoI and SalI to release the 114 bp SRC monomer. pUC19-SRC1 was digested and dephosphorylated before comparing its concentration with that of the purified SRC monomer DNA fragment by 1.2% gel electrophoresis. The molar ratio of pUC19-SRC1 and SRC1 monomer was 1:5 for ligating SRC1 into pUC19-SRC1 to generate pUC19-SRC2. Five microliters of the ligation reaction was transformed into 100 μl MAX efficiency Stbl2™ competent cells. The correct clones of pUC19-SRC were determined by DNA sequencing with forward and reverse M13 primers. DNA inserts with more SRC1 repeats were constructed in the same strategy and termed pUC19-SRCn, where n indicates the number of monomeric repeats. The longest insert contained twenty tandem repeats of SRC1 monomer. Modification of Expression Plasmid pET21a(+)—Two sense and antisense oligonucleotides of 36 base (Fig. 2) were synthesized on a 0.01 μmol scale for the construction of pET21a(+) adaptor. Oligonucleotides were phosphorylated and purified, then ligated into pET21a(+) expression plasmid digested with BamHI and XhoI using the same method as described for gene construction. Five microliters of the ligation reaction was transformed into 100 μl Library efficiency DH5α™ competent cells. Only pET21a(+) plasmid that could be digested with AgeI was chosen for DNA sequencing with T7 forward and reverse primers. Six histidines were introduced into pET21a(+) at the C terminus for the purpose of purification of the target protein by specific interaction with Ni-NTA resin. Construction of Recombinant Expression Plasmid pET21a(+)-SRCn—pUC19 containing SRC of 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 repeats were digested with BamHI to liberate the SRCn inserts. SRCn inserts were purified and recovered by the same method described in gene construction and then inserted into BamHI-digested and calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase-dephosphorylated pET21a(+) plasmid, which had been modified with the adaptor in Fig. 2. The molar ratio of SRC inserts and modified pET21a(+) was controlled in the range of 1:3-5. Five microliters of the ligation reaction was transformed into 100 μl MAX efficiency Stbl2™ competent cells. The correct clones of recombinant expression plasmid pET21a(+)-SRCn were determined by DNA sequencing with forward and reverse T7 primers. The amino acid sequence of the sericin-like protein cloned in the pET21a(+)-SRCn plasmid is shown in Fig. 3. Protein Expression—Recombinant expression plasmid pET21a(+)-SRCn prepared from Stlb2™ cells was transformed into Escherichia coli RY-3041 strain, which was kindly provided by Professor Ry Young (Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX). RY-3041 is a BL21(DE3) SlyD- strain that is defective in the expression of SlyD (25Yan S.Z. Beeler J.A. Chen Y. Shelton R.K. Tang W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8500-8506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Fed-batch cultures were grown at 37 °C in a 1.25 liter jar fermentor (Bioflo 3000; New Brunswick Scientific Co., Edison, NJ) containing 1 liter of R/2 medium, which consisted of (g/l distilled water): glucose, 10; yeast extract, 20; (NH4)2HPO4, 2; KH2PO4, 6.75; citric acid, 0.85; MgSO4·7H2O, 0.7; FeSO4·7H2O, 0.05; ZnSO4·7H2O, 0.01125; CuSO4·5H2O, 0.005; MnSO4·H2O, 0.0025; Na2B4O7·10H2O, 0.00115; CaCl2·2H2O, 0.01; (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O, 0.0005; 30 mg ampicilin (26Kim Y.C. Kwon S. Lee S.Y. Chang H.N. Biotechnology Letter. 1998; 20: 799-803Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). A seed culture (50 ml) was prepared in the same medium. The culture pH was controlled at 6.8 by the addition of 28% (v/v) ammonia water except for periods when the pH increased due to glucose depletion. The dissolved oxygen concentration was kept at 40% of air saturation by automatically increasing the agitation speed to 850 rpm and by supplying pure oxygen when required. A nutrient feed solution (500 g of glucose/l, 20 g of MgSO4·7H2O/l, 100 g of yeast extract/l; 30 μg/ml kanamycin) was automatically added when pH was higher than 6.83. Expression was induced by adding isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside to a final concentration of 2 mm at the early log phase when A 600 was about 30. Cells were harvested after 3 h of induction. Protein Purification—The cultures were harvested and centrifuged at 4 °C, 6000 × g, for 10 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (100 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm Tris base, 8 m urea, 20 mm imidazole, pH 8.0) by stirring at 5 ml per gram wet weight for 1 h, and then the lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min at room temperature to pellet the cellular debris. The supernatant containing the unpurified protein was stored at -70 °C until further processing. The recombinant sericin-like protein was purified using Ni-NTA agarose resin. One ml of 50% Ni-NTA slurry was added to 8 ml of lysate supernatant and mixed gently by shaking for 1 h at room temperature. The lysate-resin mixture was loaded into a column and then washed twice with wash buffer C (100 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm Tris base, 8 m urea, 20 mm imidazole, pH 6.3). Protein was eluted with elute buffer D (100 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm Tris base, 8 m urea at pH 5.9) and elute buffer E (100 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm Tris base, 8 m urea at pH 4.5). The protein concentration was analyzed by bicinchoninic assay (Pierce) against a bovine serum albumin standard. Purified protein was dialyzed using Slide-A-Lyzer dialysis cassette (molecular weight cut-off = 3,500) against deionized distilled water or 1 mm phosphate buffer, pH 8. Fibril formation occurred when the protein was dialyzed against deionized water, pH 6.3, to remove high concentration urea and other salts during purification. High pH could be used to decrease precipitation of SRC protein because the protein was negatively charged at high pH and the charge repulsion slowed down the protein aggregation. LDS-PAGE and Western Blots—LDS-PAGE was performed using NuPAGE™ 4-12% Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen), and the protein bands were visualized with colloidal blue staining (Invitrogen). Western blotting to nitrocellulose was performed using XCell SureLock™ Mini-Cell and Xcell II™ blot module with a NuPAGE transfer buffer, pH7.2. The T7-tag fusion proteins were detected on blots using a T7-tag alkaline phosphatase conjugate. Standards containing the S-tag peptide were used with molecular masses of 15, 25, 35, 50, 75, and 150 kDa and were detected by S-protein alkaline phosphatase conjugate. Target bands were visualized with chemiluminescent DCP-Star™ substrate. Membranes were developed with TBST (10 mm Tris-HCL, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) and 1% gelatin and then incubated with S-protein alkaline phosphatase conjugate according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Novagen). Amino Acid Composition Analysis—Amino acid analysis was carried out at the Yale University W. M. Keck Biotechnology Resource Laboratory on a Beckman Model 7300 ion-exchange instrument following a 16 h hydrolysis at 115 °C in 100 μl of 6 N HCl and 0.2% phenol that also contained 2 nmol norleucine. The latter serves as an internal standard to correct for losses that may occur during sample transfers and drying. After hydrolysis, the HCl was dried in a Speedvac and the resulting amino acids dissolved in 100 μl Beckman sample buffer that contained 2 nmol homoserine with the latter acting as a second internal standard to independently monitor transfer of the sample onto the analyzer. MALDI-TOF—A Bruker Proflex™ mass spectrometer (Bruker, Billerica, MA) was used for molecular weight determinations. Recombinant protein concentration was 1 μg/μl, and the matrix α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid concentration was 10 g/l in 50:50 water/acetonitrile solution. The protein and matrix were mixed at 1:1 ratio. Protein calibration standards including trypsinogen, protein A, and bovine albumin were used to calibrate mass spectrometer and the covered mass range is from 20 to 70 kDa. Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—Purified SRC samples (starting concentration of 2.5 mg/ml) were dialyzed against 1 mm phosphate buffer, pH 8, using Slide-A-Lyzer dialysis cassettes (molecular weight cut-off = 3,500). Samples were removed at various time points and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was analyzed by CD at 20 °C in a JASCO J-710 spectropolarimeter (Easton, MD) under a nitrogen atmosphere. Denatured purification buffer (pH 4.5) of the same volume as the SRC sample was also dialyzed against 1 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and was removed at various time points and analyzed by CD as background after filtering with a 0.22 μm filter. A quartz cell with a path length of 0.1 cm was used and the spectra were recorded between 260 and 190 nm at 1 nm intervals, with a response time 8 s, scan speed 10 nm/min, bandwidth 1 nm, and accumulation of 3 scans. The protein concentration was analyzed by bicinchoninic assay against a bovine serum albumin standard, and the experimental data were expressed as mean residue molar ellipticities [τ]. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy—FTIR studies were performed using a Bruker Equinox 55 FTIR spectrometer with an FTIR microscope attachment. Pellets were removed from SRC samples taken at various time points as described under “Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy.” The supernatant was dried on ZnS crystals and examined with the FTIR microscope in the transmission mode. Hydrophilic ZnS crystal surface can preserve the solution-state conformation of protein (23Winkler S. Wilson D. Kaplan D.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12739-12746Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Both second derivatization and Fourier self-deconvolution were performed to determine the peaks in amide I band and ensure the fidelity of each method. The Gaussian × Lorentzian function was applied to curve fit data peaks using Peak Fit v4 (Jandel). The contribution of each component band to the amide I band was evaluated by dividing the total area of amide I band with area of each component band. For comparison, FTIR spectra of regenerated sericin was also taken after the drop of sericin solution dried. Regenerated silk sericin was prepared after treating cocoons of B. mori silkworm with boiling water for 60 min and filtering using 0.2 μm polyvinylidene difluoride filter (Millipore). Scanning Electron Microscopy—Ten μl of a fibril sample formed after dialysis against distilled water, pH 6.3, for 10 h was taken from dialysis cassettes and loaded onto a silicon chip. After adsorption to the surface for 5 min, the sample was rinsed with deionized distilled water and air-dried. Fibril morphology was characterized with a LEO 982 Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (LEO Electron Microsopy, Inc., Thornwood, NY) at 1.0 kV. Congo Red Staining and Polarized Light Microscopy—One hundred μl SRC8 protein fibril suspensions formed by dialysis against distilled water, pH 6.4, and 500 μl CR solution (100 μm in TBS solution, pH 7.4) were incubated at room temperature overnight. After centrifuge at 14,000 rpm for 5 min, the pellet was resuspended with 1 ml TBS solution, pH 7.4, and centrifuged again to pellet the sample. Unbound Congo red was removed by repeating the process twice. One-hundred μl TBS, pH 7.4, was added to the fibril pellet and 20 μl sample was pipetted onto a glass slide. The slide was then dried for a few hours. Birefringence was determined with a Nikon Eclipse E600 Polarized microscope. Construction of Recombinant Expression Plasmid pET21a(+)-SRCn—Fig. 4 shows the results of electrophoresis analysis of SRC inserts of various length in the modified pET21a(+) expression plasmid and SRC monomeric insert in pUC 19. pET21a(+)-SRCn was digested with NheI (restriction site in pET21a(+) plamid) and AgeI (restriction site introduced with the adaptor) instead of BamHI because the inserts of SRCn can self-ligate before inserting into pET21a(+) to form pET21a(+)-(SRCn)n. Double digestion with NheI and AgeI separates multimerized SRCn from single SRCn constructs. Protein Expression and Purification—Sericin-like proteins were expressed in E. coli RY 3041 strain, a mutant of BL21(DE3). The C terminus of SlyD protein expressed by RY3041 was deleted so that SlyD protein cannot coelute with the target protein by binding to the Ni-NTA resin (25Yan S.Z. Beeler J.A. Chen Y. Shelton R.K. Tang W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8500-8506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The longest SRC insert contained 20 SRC1 tandem repeats (totally 1368 bp), but the largest SRC expressed, SRC12 (46.5 kDa) was much shorter than SRC20. The protein concentration of purified SRCn decreased with the length of the target protein, which may be because of the high content of serine placing excessive demand on Ser tRNA so that no intact protein can be expressed if the DNA encoding for the target protein is too long. Because the His-tag is designed at the C-terminal of the protein, no truncated target protein will be detected. The same issue has been observed previously in expression of spider silk genes (17Prince J.T. McGrath K.P. DiGirolamo C.M. Kaplan D.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10879-10885Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 22Szela S. Avtges P. Valluzzi R. Winkler S. Wilson D. Kirschner D. Kaplan D.L. Biomacromolecules. 2000; 1: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Overall yield of purified SRCn was 15-36 mg/l depending on the molecular weight of SRCn. The apparent molecular weights of the SRC proteins as estimated by LDS-PAGE were double the molecular weight of the SRC proteins (Fig. 5a). Reduced electrophoretic mobility has been observed previously for various proteins (27McGrath K.P. Fournier M.J. Mason T.L. Tirrell D.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 727-733Crossref Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 28Kaufmann E. Geisler N. Weber K. FEBS Lett. 1984; 170: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 29Mira H. Vilar M. Perez-Paya E.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1870-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and this can stem from unusual amino acid composition, intrinsic net charge or protein oligomerization. The pI values of SRC proteins are 5.98, 5.02, and 4.61 for SRC4, 8, and 12, respectively. Therefore, these acidic proteins bind the anionic surfactant lithium dodecyl sulfate at working pH 8.5 weakly due to electrostatic repulsion. The constant charge/mass ratio was lower than normal resulting in reduced electrophoretic mobility. Western blot analysis (Fig. 5b) also detected the SRC proteins based on the T7-tag. Amino Acid Composition Analysis—Amino acid composition analysis confirmed the correct composition for the purified SRCn (Table I). SRC8 was chosen for further structural study because of the combination of high molecular weight and high expression yield compared with SRC4 and SRC12. The purity of the SRC8 protein sample for further structural study was > 93% based on amino acid composition analysis. Analysis of SRC8 by MALDI-TOF showed a single peak of molecular mass of 32219 Da, close to the theoretical mass of 31947 Da.Table IAmino acid composition analysis of the predominant amino acids in the recombinant sericin-like proteinsAmino acidSRC4 (17.4 kDa)SRC8 (31.9 kDa)SRC12 (46.5 kDa)Sericin3ExpectedActualExpectedActualExpectedActual%%%Serine40.640.242.539.743.242.538.1Glycine16.719.716.317.516.115.316.9Asparagines + aspartic acid11.113.312.012.412.412.911.1Threonine10.66.910.610.310.58.87.5Valine4.45.04.84.85.04.96.1Tyrosine6.76.67.27.57.47.64.7Arginine2.82.52.72.82.72.72.7 Open table in a new tab Circular Dichroism—CD spectra of SRC8 dialyzed for 1 h showed a minimum at 196 nm, suggesting random coil structure (Fig. 6). However, there was no random coil maximum at 212 nm, the [τ] value around 220 is below zero, suggesting there were other structures coexisting with random coil, such as β-sheet and β-turn (33Woody R.W. Blout E.R. Bovey F.A. Lotan N. Goodman M. Peptides, Polypeptides, and Proteins. Wiley, New York1974: 338-350Google Scholar, 34Woody R.W. J. Polym. Sci. Macromole. Rev. 1977; 12: 181-199Crossref Scopus (143) Google Scholar), which exhibit negative bands near 216 and between 220 and 230 nm, respectively. Therefore, the secondary structure of SRC8 dialyzed for 1 h appears to be the combination of random coil, β-turn, and β-sheet. The CD spectra changed as a function of time, indicating a gradual transition upon dialysis. After dialysis for 3.5 h, CD spectra showed the maximum at 196 nm, the minimum at 218 nm, diagnostic of β-sheet secondary structure. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy—FTIR spectra of SRC8 dialyzed for 1 h is similar to regenerated native sericin, which has broad peaks around 1658 cm-1 (amide I), and 1538 cm-1 (amide II), indicating random coil and β turn conformations (35Valluzzi R.

After dialysis for 3 h, the FTIR spectra exhibit aminde I and II vibrational modes at 1621, 1699 and 1522 cm-1, respectively, characteristic of β-sheet conformation. The weak amide I component at 1697 cm-1 is the large splitting of the amide I mode cau"
https://openalex.org/W2073797323,"Bovine beta-lactoglobulin (beta-lg) has been used extensively as a model for studying protein folding. One of the problems preventing clarification of the folding mechanism is the incomplete reversibility from the unfolded state, probably caused by the thiol-disulfide exchange between a free thiol at Cys-121 and two disulfide bonds. We constructed and expressed three beta-lg subtype A mutants in which Cys-121 was replaced by Ala, Ser, or Val (i.e. C121A, C121S, and C121V). We studied the reversibilities of these mutants from urea denaturation using circular dichroism, tryptophan fluorescence, reversed-phase and gel-filtration high performance liquid chromatographies, and SDS-PAGE. The folded structure of each mutant was similar to that of wild-type beta-lg. Urea-induced unfolding at pH 7.0 and 3.0 showed that although the C121S mutation notably decreases the stability, the destabilizing effects of the C121A and C121V mutations are less severe. For all of the mutants, complete refolding from the unfolded state in 8 M urea at both pH 7.0 and 3.0 was observed. Kinetics of the formation of the irreversibly unfolded species of wild-type beta-lg in 8 M urea at pH 7.0 indicated that, first, an intramolecular thiol-disulfide exchange occurs to produce a mixture of species with non-native disulfide bonds followed by the intermolecular thiol-disulfide exchange producing the oligomers. These results indicate that intramolecular and intermolecular thiol-disulfide exchange reactions cause the low reversibility of wild-type beta-lg especially at neutral pH and that the mutation of Cys-121 improves the reversibility, enabling us to study the folding of beta-lg more exactly under various conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1990528785,"We have identified a cDNA encoding a novel isoform of the mouse V-ATPase d subunit (d2). The protein encoded is 350 amino acids in length and shows 42 and 67% identity to the yeast d subunit (Vma6p) and the mouse d1 isoform, respectively. Reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis using isoform-specific primers demonstrate that d2 is expressed mainly in kidney and at lower levels in heart, spleen, skeletal muscle, and testis. Although d1 and d2 show similar levels of sequence homology to Vma6p, only the d1 isoform can complement the phenotype of a yeast strain in which VMA6 has been disrupted when cells are grown at 30 °C. The d2 isoform, however, can complement the vma6Δ phenotype when cells are grown at 25 °C. Moreover, partial assembly of the V-ATPase complex on the vacuolar membrane can be detected under these conditions, although assembly is significantly lower than that observed for the strain expressing Vma6p. This reduced assembly is also reflected in a reduced level of concanamycin-sensitive ATPase activity and proton transport in isolated vacuoles. Comparison of the kinetic properties of V-ATPase complexes containing Vma6p and d1 demonstrate that although the Km for ATP hydrolysis is similar (0.26 and 0.31 mm, respectively), the coupling ratio (proton transport/ATP hydrolysis) is ∼3–6-fold higher for d1-containing complexes than for Vma6p-containing complexes. These results suggest that subunit d may play a role in coupling of proton transport and ATP hydrolysis. We have identified a cDNA encoding a novel isoform of the mouse V-ATPase d subunit (d2).

The V1 domain is a peripheral complex with molecular mass of 640 kDa composed of eight different subunits of molecular mass 70–14 kDa (subunits A-H) that is responsible for ATP hydrolysis. The V0 domain is a 260-kDa integral complex composed of five subunits of molecular masses 100–17 kDa (subunits a, d, c, c′, and c″) that is responsible for proton translocation. In yeast cells, all subunits are encoded by single genes with the exception of subunit a, which is encoded by two genes, VPH1 and STV1 (14Manolson M.F. Proteau D. Preston R.A. Stenbit A. Roberts B.T.

Information about the function of four of the five V0 subunits has been obtained by site-directed and random mutagenesis. Thus, each of the three proteolipid subunits (c, c′, and c″) have been shown to contain a single, buried glutamate residue that is essential for proton translocation (16Noumi T. Beltran C. Nelson H.

Despite this information regarding most of the V0 subunits, virtually nothing is known about the function of subunit d. The gene encoding subunit d was initially cloned from bovine adrenal medulla (23Wang S.-Y. Moriyama Y. Mandel M. Hulmes J.D. Pan Y.-C.E. Danho W. Nelson H. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 263: 17638-17642Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) and subsequently from yeast as the VMA6 gene, where its disruption was shown to lead to a typical Vma- phenotype (24Bauerle C. Ho M.N. Lindorfer M.A. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12749-12757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sequence analysis revealed the presence of no obvious transmembrane segments (23Wang S.-Y. Moriyama Y. Mandel M. Hulmes J.D. Pan Y.-C.E. Danho W. Nelson H. Nelson N. J. Biol.

Puopolo K. Marquez-Sterling N. Arai H. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 967-973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or, in vivo, upon glucose withdrawal (26Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17025-17032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that subunit d is bound to the V0 domain through protein-protein interactions rather than by integration into the membrane. Mild proteolysis results in rapid cleavage of subunit d in intact clathrin-coated vesicles, suggesting that it is exposed on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane (27Adachi I. Arai H. Pimental R. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 960-966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to yeast and bovine, the gene encoding subunit d has also been cloned and sequenced from humans and plants (28Smith A.N. Borthwick K.J. Karet F.E. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 297: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 29Sze H. Schumacher K. Muller M.L. Padmanaban S. Taiz L. Trends Plant Sci. 2002; 7: 157-161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Like numerous other V-ATPase subunits in higher eukaryotes, subunit d appears to be encoded by multiple genes (28Smith A.N. Borthwick K.J. Karet F.E. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 297: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In this paper, we have identified a novel isoform of subunit d in mouse, investigated its pattern of expression, and begun to probe the function of this subunit by heterologous expression in yeast. Materials—Escherichia coli culture media was purchased from Difco Laboratories. Restriction endonucleases, T4 DNA ligase, and other molecular biology reagents were from Invitrogen, Promega, and New England Biolabs. Most other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Isolation of cDNA Clones—The cDNA encoding the mouse d subunit isoform d2 was identified in the expression sequence tag data base and expressed sequence tag clone uj32h10 was obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The cDNA encoding the mouse d1 isoform (uj10a07) was also obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection. Test of the Ability of the Mouse d Subunit Isoforms to Complement the Phenotype of the Yeast VMA6 Deletion Strain—Yeast cells lacking the functional endogenous VMA6 gene were made from YPH500 (MATα ura3–52 lys2–801amber ade2–101ochre trp1-Δ63 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1) by replacing the coding region of VMA6 with the TRP1 gene. The yeast VMA6 gene was isolated from the YPH500 genomic DNA by PCR using the following primers: forward, ctccagcatacatattaagttgca; reverse, gtccaggttaggcgaggatattact. The amplified fragments were cloned into the TOPO-pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen). The VMA6 gene was excised from the resulting plasmid at XbaI and EcoRI sites and integrated into the XbaI and EcoRI sites of the pRS413 vector for expression. The mouse d subunit isoform cDNAs were inserted just downstream of the GPD gene promoter in the pRS413 vector (ATCC). Cells were transformed with plasmids pRS413, pRS413-VMA6, pRS413-GPD-m d1, and pRS413-GPD-m d2 using the lithium acetate method and selected on SD histidine minus plates. Growth phenotypes of the transformants were assessed on YPD plates buffered with 50 mm KH2PO4/succinic acid to either pH 7.5 or 5.5. RT-PCR—RT-PCR was performed using cDNA prepared from different mouse tissues or different developmental stages of mouse embryos and the following subunit-specific primers: m d1 forward AGTCTAGTTGCGTGCGGGCAGAT; m d1 reverse, ATAAGTTATGAAGTCCAGGAAGCTGGCGA; m d2 forward, TTCAGTTGCTATCCAGGACTCGGA; m d2 reverse, GCATGTCATGTAGGTGAGAAATGTGCTCA. Identification of Transcription Initiation Sites for d Subunit Isoform Genes—To determine the transcription initiation site for each d subunit isoform gene, 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends was performed using the First-Choice rapid amplification of cDNA ends kit (Ambion). Reactions were performed using the manufacturer's recommended protocol, and mouse kidney poly(A) RNA was purchased from Ambion (Palo Alto, CA). Amplified fragments were cloned into the TOPO-pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced. Primers specific for the genes encoding the d subunit isoforms (m d1Rv and m d2 Rv2) that were used for amplification are indicated above. Isolation of Vacuole-enriched Membranes—Subcellular fractionation of organelles from yeast cells expressing Vma6p, the mouse d1 isoform, or the mouse d2 isoform was performed by differential centrifugation of cell lysates as described previously (30Horazdovsky B.F.

Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Yeast cells were cultured in SD-HIS medium to an A600 of 1 at 30 or 25 °C. Cells (3 × 109) were converted to spheroplasts by treatment with 150 μg/ml Zymolase 100T in 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5), 1.2 m sorbitol, 1 mm MgCl2 followed by lysis in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.2 m sorbitol, 1 mm EDTA) and sedimentation for 5 min at 500 × g to remove unbroken cells. The supernatant was centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 × g to generate the vacuole-enriched membrane fraction, and the supernatant (S13) was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant of this high speed sedimentation was used as the cytosol fraction. The vacuole-enriched fraction was resuspended in sample buffer (8 m urea, 5% SDS, 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.4 mg/ml bromphenol blue, 10% 2-mercaptoethanol). Proteins in the cystosol fraction were precipitated by the addition of trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 5%, collected by centrifugation for 5 min at 13,000 × g, washed twice, and resuspended in sample buffer. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 12.5% acrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose filters, and probed with the antibodies indicated in the figure legends. Blots were developed using appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and the chemiluminescence detection kit from Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories. Vacuole Membrane Isolation—Vacuole membrane vesicles were isolated as described previously (22Kawasaki-Nishi S. Nishi T. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17941-17948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) except that all incubations carried out prior to treatment with Zymolyase were performed at 25 °C. The yeast vma6Δ strain transformed with pRS413-VMA6, pRS413-TEF-d1, and pRS413-TEF-d2 were grown to an A600 of 0.8 at 25 °C. Cells were pelleted, washed once with water, and resuspended and incubated in alkaline buffer (10 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.4) at 25 °C for 15 min. Cells were pelleted, resuspended in YEPD medium containing 0.7 m sorbitol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm Mes-Tris (pH 7.5), and 50 μg/ml Zymolase 100T, and incubated at 30 °C with gentle shaking for 60 min. Spheroplasts were washed with YEPD medium containing 0.7 m sorbitol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, osmotically lysed by incubation in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) 0.2 m sorbitol, 1 mm EDTA), and the vacuoles were isolated by flotation on two consecutive Ficoll gradients as previously described (22Kawasaki-Nishi S. Nishi T. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17941-17948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were measured by the BCA protein assay (Pierce). Detection of V-ATPase Subunits Present on Isolated Vacuolar Membranes—Vacuolar membranes were isolated from the yeast vma6Δ strain transformed with pRS413-VMA6, pRS413-TEF-d1, or pRS413-TEF-d2 and were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis using the mouse monoclonal antibodies 10D7 against Vph1p, 8B1-F3 against Vma1p, and 13D11-B2 against Vma2p (Molecular Probes, Inc.). Blots were also probed with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against Vma6p, Vma7p, Vma8p, Vma10p, and Vma13p (all generously provided by Dr. Tom Stevens), Vma4p (a generous gift of Dr. Dan Klionsky), and Vma5p (a generous gift of Dr. Patricia Kane). Following removal of unbound primary antibodies by washing, blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad) and developed using a chemiluminescence detection method obtained from Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories. Other Methods—Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA protein assay (Pierce). ATPase activity was measured using a coupled spectrophotometric assay in the presence or absence of 1 μm concanamycin, as previously described (22Kawasaki-Nishi S. Nishi T. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17941-17948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). ATP-dependent proton transport was measured in transport buffer (25 mm Mes-Tris (pH 7.2) 5 mm MgCl2) using the fluorescence probe 9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxyacridine in the presence or absence of 1 μm concanamycin, as previously described (22Kawasaki-Nishi S.

Identification of the cDNA Encoding the Mouse V-ATPase d2 Subunit Isoform—The cDNA sequence encoding the d subunit of the V-ATPase was first reported in bovine (23Wang S.-Y. Moriyama Y. Mandel M.

Genomic sequencing has recently demonstrated the existence of a second isoform of subunit d, d2, which has been identified in humans (28Smith A.N. Borthwick K.J. Karet F.E. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 297: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and plants (29Sze H. Schumacher K. Muller M.L. Padmanaban S. Taiz L. Trends Plant Sci. 2002; 7: 157-161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). A search of the mouse expressed sequence tag and genome data bases revealed several clones encoding the second isoform of subunit d in mouse. One of these clones (uj32h10) was completely sequenced and the deduced amino acid sequence was aligned with the other d subunit isoform, d1, and the yeast d subunit, Vma6p (Fig. 1). The protein encoded contains 350 amino acid residues and has a predicted molecular mass of 40,459. The gene encoding the mouse d1 isoform is located on chromosome 4, whereas the gene encoding d2 is located on chromosome 8. Based on the genomic sequence, the genes encoding the d1 and d2 isoforms contain seven introns, with the intron/exon borders located at the same sites (Fig. 1). The overall identity (and similarity) to the mouse d1, human d1 (33van Hille B. Vanek M. Richener H. Green J.R. Bilbe G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), human d2 (28Smith A.N. Borthwick K.J. Karet F.E.

These results suggest that clone uj32h10 encodes the mouse d2 subunit isoform of the V-ATPase. Comparison of the amino acid sequences between species reveals that isoforms of the V-ATPase d subunit may have arisen more than once during the course of evolution (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Evolutionary relationship between the d subunit isoforms. The phylogenetic tree constructed on the basis of the sequences shown in Fig. 1 as well as other previously reported d subunit sequences (24Bauerle C. Ho M.N. Lindorfer M.A. Stevens T.H. J. Biol.

Accession numbers of these isoforms are NP_038505.1 (mouse d1, m d1), AAF45902.1 (D. melanogaster d-a, Dm d-a), AAF56104.1 (D. melanogaster d-b, Dm d-b), BAB02186 (A. thaliana d1, At d1), Q9LHA4 (A. thaliana d2, At d2), NP_491515.1 (C. elegans, Ce d).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Tissue Distribution of the Mouse d Subunit Isoforms—To investigate the tissue distribution of mRNA for the two d subunit isoforms, RT-PCR was performed using isoform-specific primers and RNA isolated from eight mouse tissues and several developmental stages. As can be seen in Fig. 3, the d1 isoform is ubiquitously expressed in all tissues tested, whereas the d2 isoform is expressed predominantly in kidney, although some expression is also detected in lung, testis, skeletal muscle, and heart, in agreement with previous observations (23Wang S.-Y. Moriyama Y. Mandel M. Hulmes J.D. Pan Y.-C.E. Danho W. Nelson H. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 263: 17638-17642Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). With respect to developmental stage, the d1 isoform is expressed throughout early development, whereas the d2 isoform is expressed heavily at day 7 followed by a disappearance and a gradual recovery to original levels by day 17. Development of the mouse kidney begins after embryonic day 14. These results suggest that expression of the d2 isoform from day 15 is correlated with kidney development. Expression of the d2 isoform at day 7 suggests that this isoform may also serve some other function in early mouse development. The 5′-Untranslated Region of the Mouse and Human d Subunit Isoforms—To address the basis for the tissue-specific expression of the d2 isoform, the nucleotide sequence of 5′-upstream regions of the mouse and human genes were compared. The 5′-upstream sequence of each gene was identified from human and mouse genome sequence data bases reported at NCBI. Harr-plot analysis indicates that although the 5′-upstream regions of the genes encoding the mouse d1 and d2 isoforms have no obvious homology (data not shown), both of the d1 and d2 5′-upstream regions show significant sequence homology between mouse and human (Fig. 4). The transcription initiation sites were identified using 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends, primers specific for each gene and mouse kidney cDNA as the template and are shown in Fig. 4, a and b, by closed circles. As can be seen, for the gene encoding the d1 these sites fall within one of the two regions of high sequence conservation, whereas for the gene encoding d2, transcription starts just downstream of the 3′ most region of homology. Complementation of the Yeast vma6Δ Phenotype by the Mouse d Subunit Isoforms at 30 °C—To analyze the function of the mouse d subunit isoforms, we expressed each of these isoforms in a yeast strain (vma6Δ) in which the endogenous VMA6 gene has been disrupted. Despite the very similar level of sequence identity between the two mouse proteins and Vma6p (45 and 42% for d1 and d2, respectively), only d1 was able to complement the growth defect of this strain when assayed at pH 7.5 and 30 °C (Fig. 5a). There are several possible reasons to account for the inability of the d2 isoform to complement the Vma- phenotype of the vma6Δ strain, including loss of activity of the V-ATPase and failure to assemble a complex. As an initial assessment of the assembly competence of the heterologously expressed proteins, Vma6p, the mouse d1 isoform or the mouse d2 isoform were expressed in the vma6Δ strain, the cells were homogenized and the whole cell lysate was fractionated by differential sedimentation to give a cytosolic fraction and a vacuole-enriched fraction, as previously described (30Horazdovsky B.F. Emr S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4953-4962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Graham L.A. Hill K.J. Stevens T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This method was employed rather than the conventional vacuole isolation procedure because it is gentler and therefore less likely to disrupt V-ATPase complexes. These fractions were then separated by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis was performed using antibodies against Vma1p (a marker for the V1 domain) and Vph1p (a marker for the V0 domain). As can be seen in Fig. 5b, in cells expressing the d2 isoform no assembly of subunit A (Vma1p) onto vacuoles occurs. By contrast, for cells expressing either Vma6p or the d1 isoform, assembly of subunit A onto vacuolar membranes is observed. Vph1p is observed in both the whole cell lysate and on vacuolar membranes of cells expressing Vma6p but is not observed in cells lacking subunit d or in cells expressing the d2 isoform. This is consistent with previous observations indicating that a stable V0 domain is not formed in the absence of"

https://openalex.org/W1991985619,"The urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) is released from human cancers and is readily detected in blood. In animal models, soluble uPAR (SuPAR) antagonizes cancer progression; however, the mechanism by which SuPAR functions in vivo remains unclear. It is generally thought that SuPAR scavenges uPA and prevents its interaction with membrane-anchored uPAR. In this study, we demonstrate a novel molecular mechanism by which SuPAR may inhibit cancer progression. We show that SuPAR has the potential to directly and in a uPA-independent manner block the signaling activity of membrane-anchored uPAR. Whether SuPAR inhibits signaling is cell type-specific, depending on the state of the endogenous uPA-uPAR signaling system. In uPAR-deficient cells that lack endogenous uPAR signaling, including uPAR–/–murine embryonic fibroblasts and human embryonal kidney 293 cells, SuPAR functions as a partial signaling agonist that activates ERK/mitogen-activated protein kinase. By contrast, in cells with potent autocrine uPA-uPAR signaling systems, including MDA-MB 231 breast cancer cells and low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1-deficient murine embryonic fibroblasts, SuPAR substantially decreases ERK activation. The mechanism probably involves competitive displacement of membrane-anchored uPAR-uPA complex from signaling adaptor proteins. As a result of its effects on cell signaling, SuPAR blocks cell growth and inhibits cellular invasion of Matrigel™. Cleavage of SuPAR by proteinases increases its signaling agonist activity and reverses its inhibitory effects on growth and invasion. Thus, proteolytic cleavage represents a molecular switch that neutralizes the anticancer activity of SuPAR. The urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) is released from human cancers and is readily detected in blood. In animal models, soluble uPAR (SuPAR) antagonizes cancer progression; however, the mechanism by which SuPAR functions in vivo remains unclear. It is generally thought that SuPAR scavenges uPA and prevents its interaction with membrane-anchored uPAR. In this study, we demonstrate a novel molecular mechanism by which SuPAR may inhibit cancer progression. We show that SuPAR has the potential to directly and in a uPA-independent manner block the signaling activity of membrane-anchored uPAR. Whether SuPAR inhibits signaling is cell type-specific, depending on the state of the endogenous uPA-uPAR signaling system. In uPAR-deficient cells that lack endogenous uPAR signaling, including uPAR–/–murine embryonic fibroblasts and human embryonal kidney 293 cells, SuPAR functions as a partial signaling agonist that activates ERK/mitogen-activated protein kinase. By contrast, in cells with potent autocrine uPA-uPAR signaling systems, including MDA-MB 231 breast cancer cells and low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1-deficient murine embryonic fibroblasts, SuPAR substantially decreases ERK activation. The mechanism probably involves competitive displacement of membrane-anchored uPAR-uPA complex from signaling adaptor proteins. As a result of its effects on cell signaling, SuPAR blocks cell growth and inhibits cellular invasion of Matrigel™. Cleavage of SuPAR by proteinases increases its signaling agonist activity and reverses its inhibitory effects on growth and invasion. Thus, proteolytic cleavage represents a molecular switch that neutralizes the anticancer activity of SuPAR.

Biol. 2002; 3: 932-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). uPAR-associated uPA readily activates plasminogen and thereby initiates a cell surface proteinase cascade, which culminates in metalloproteinase activation and degradation of extracellular matrix proteins, particularly in association with leading lamellipodia in migrating cells (3Estreicher A.

Because uPAR is glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored, adaptor proteins are necessary to transmit signaling responses, and in this capacity, multiple proteins have been implicated, including integrins, the epidermal growth factor receptor, FPR-like receptor-1/lipoxin A4 receptor, caveolin, and gp130 (11Aguirre Ghiso J.A.

The function of uPA may be to alter the conformation of uPAR so that association with transmembrane adaptor proteins is favored (20Ploug M. Kjalke M. Ronne E. Weidle U. Hoyer-Hansen G. Dano K. J.

Mature uPAR consists of three homologous domains joined by flexible linker sequences. The principal uPA-binding sequence is located in the most N-terminal domain (D1); however, secondary binding sites are contributed by D2 and D3 (22Behrendt N. Ploug M. Patthy L. Houen G. Blasi F.

D2 contains vitronectin recognition sequences, which may be supported by sequences in the other domains (25Hoyer-Hansen G. Behrendt N. Ploug M. Dano K. Preissner K.T.

Eriksen J. Solberg H. Nielsen B.S. Kristensen P. Lund L.R. Dano K. FEBS Lett. 1993; 326: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Resnati et al. (30Resnati M. Guttinger M. Valcamonica S.

Cleavage exposes the active epitope, SRSRY, which remains intact and associated with D2, depending on the actual peptide bond that is cleaved. Cleaved SuPAR (CSuPAR) activates the Src family member hck and induces changes in the cytoskeleton and relocation of integrins to the leading edge of cellular migration, mimicking the responses observed when cells are treated with uPA (30Resnati M.

Similarly, Aguire Ghiso et al. (11Aguirre Ghiso J.A. Kovalski K. Ossowski L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 89-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar) reported that SuPAR activates ERK in uPAR antisense RNA-expressing epidermoid carcinoma cells. In the MCF-7 and epidermoid carcinoma cell systems, SuPAR cleavage apparently was not necessary. In breast cancer and other forms of malignancy, high levels of uPA and uPAR have been correlated with cancer progression and a poor prognosis (5Andreasen P.A. Kjoller L. Christensen L. Duffy M.J.

In humans, SuPAR is normally found in the plasma; however, the level of SuPAR may be dramatically increased in patients with various forms of malignancy, including ovarian cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, leukemia, colon cancer, and breast cancer (35Pappot H.

In xenograft animal model experiments, SuPAR reduces the growth and metastasis of MDA-MB 231 breast cancer cells and OV-MZ-6#8 ovarian cancer cells (44Kruger A. Soeltl R. Lutz V. Wilhelm O.G.

The mechanism was assumed to involve SuPAR functioning as a scavenger for uPA, like a high affinity antibody, because alternative mechanisms by which SuPAR may counteract cancer progression had not been identified (44Kruger A. Soeltl R. Lutz V. Wilhelm O.G. Magdolen V. Rojo E.E. Hantzopoulos P.A. Graeff H. Gansbacher B. Schmitt M. Cancer Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 292-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 45Lutz V.

Rettenberger P. Schmitt M. Graeff H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 337: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The purpose of the present investigation was to test the hypothesis that SuPAR inhibits cancer progression by directly regulating cell signaling, as opposed to “uPA scavenging.” To test this hypothesis, we studied the effects of human SuPAR on murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Human SuPAR does not bind murine uPA, eliminating uPA scavenging as a possible mechanism (47Estreicher A. Wohlwend A. Belin D. Schleuning W. Vassalli J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1180-1189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that SuPAR may activate or inhibit ERK phosphorylation, depending on the state of the autocrine uPA-uPAR signaling system. In cells that have a highly activated autocrine signaling system, including low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP-1)-deficient MEFs and MDA-MB 231 breast cancer cells, SuPAR inhibits ERK activation, cell growth, and Matrigel™ invasion. The most likely mechanism involves competition with membrane-anchored uPAR-uPA complex for signaling adaptor proteins. Proteinase cleavage serves as a molecular switch, converting SuPAR from a partial agonist into a full agonist and thereby eliminating its function as an anticancer agent. Reagents and Antibodies—Recombinant human SuPAR was from R & D Systems, Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). CSuPAR was prepared by treating SuPAR with 2.0 nm chymotrypsin for 7 h at 37 °C. The chymotrypsin was inactivated with 1.0 mm PMSF, as described (22Behrendt N. Ploug M. Patthy L. Houen G. Blasi F. Dano K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7842-7847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Chymotrypsin, poly-l-lysine, sodium orthovanadate, and protease inhibitor mixture were from Sigma-Aldrich. Antibody that specifically detects phosphorylated ERK1 and ERK2 was from Cell Signaling Technologies (Beverly, MA). Polyclonal antibody that recognizes total ERK was from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies specific for rabbit IgG was from Amersham Biosciences. Cell Culture—LRP-1-deficient MEF-2 cells were originally prepared by Willnow and Herz (48Willnow T.E. Herz J. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 719-726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). uPAR–/– MEFs (A1 cells) were prepared as previously described (13Ma Z. Thomas K.S. Webb D.J. Moravec R. Salicioni A.M. Mars W.M. Gonias S.L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 1061-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Both cell lines and human embryonal kidney (HEK) 293 cells (ATCC) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). MDA-MB 231 cells (ATCC) were maintained in L-15 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). The cells were plated in tissue culture wells that were precoated with vitronectin (5 μg/ml) purified as previously described (49Yatohgo T. Izumi M. Kashiwagi H. Hayashi M. Cell Struct. Funct. 1988; 13: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar), fibronectin (10 μg/ml), type-1 collagen (25 μg/ml) (BD biosciences), or poly-l-lysine (25 μg/ml). ERK Phosphorylation—MEF-2, A1 MEFs, and MDA-MB 231 cells were plated in 60-mm dishes and cultured in serum-free medium. After 18 h, the cultures were washed and then treated with recombinant human SuPAR or CSuPAR, as indicated. The cells were extracted in 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, containing protease inhibitor mixture and sodium orthovanadate (1 mm). The protein concentration in each extract was determined by bicinchoninic acid assay (Sigma-Aldrich). Equal amounts of cell extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 10% slabs, electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and probed with specific antibodies for phosphorylated ERK and total ERK. Control experiments were performed in which PMSF alone or PMSF-treated chymotrypsin was added to cultures. Changes in ERK phosphorylation were not observed. Cell Growth—Cell growth was measured by MTT assay, using the Cell Proliferation Kit I (Roche Applied Sciences). The cells were plated in 96-well plates and cultured for 18 h in serum-containing medium. The cultures were then washed with serum-free medium and treated with SuPAR, CSuPAR, or vehicle in serum-free medium for 48 h. MTT hydrolysis was determined, as directed by the manufacturer and detected on the basis of the absorbance at 570 nm. In each experiment, parallel cultures were analyzed prior to the 48-h incubation with SuPAR, CSuPAR, or vehicle. MTT hydrolysis is proportional to the number of viable cells in a culture. Matrigel™ Invasion—Matrigel™ invasion chambers with polymerized growth factor-reduced Matrigel™ were purchased from BD Biosciences. MDA-MB 231 cells were plated in vitronectin-coated wells and cultured in serum-free L-15 medium for 18 h. The cells were then treated with SuPAR, CSuPAR, or vehicle as indicated, released from monolayer culture, and transferred to the upper wells of the Invasion Chambers. SuPAR or CSuPAR were added to both chambers when the cells had been pretreated with either reagent. The lower chamber also contained 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were allowed to invade for 24 h, at which time the Matrigel™ and cells that were associated with the top surfaces of the membranes were removed using cotton swabs. Cells that penetrated through the Matrigel™ to the underside surfaces of the membranes were fixed and stained with 0.1% crystal violet, as previously described (50Webb D.J. Nguyen D.H. Gonias S.L. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 123-134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The dye was eluted with 10% acetic acid, and the absorbance at 570 nm was determined. Regulation of ERK Activation by SuPAR—There is considerable evidence that SuPAR interacts directly with transmembrane adaptor proteins to elicit cellular responses that are equivalent to those caused by membrane-associated uPAR-uPA complex (17Resnati M. Pallavicini I. Wang J.M. Oppenheim J. Serhan C.N. Romano M. Blasi F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1359-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 30Resnati M. Guttinger M. Valcamonica S. Sidenius N. Blasi F. Fazioli F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1572-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 51Mizukami I.F. Todd III, R.F. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 64: 203-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To eliminate the possibility that SuPAR scavenges endogenously produced uPA and thereby indirectly affects cell signaling, we took advantage of the strict species specificity in uPA action (47Estreicher A. Wohlwend A. Belin D. Schleuning W. Vassalli J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1180-1189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and studied the response of MEFs to human SuPAR. A1 MEFs are uPAR-deficient murine cells, prepared from uPAR gene knock-out embryos (13Ma Z. Thomas K.S. Webb D.J. Moravec R. Salicioni A.M. Mars W.M. Gonias S.L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 1061-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Because uPAR is absent, these cells cannot establish autocrine uPA-uPAR signaling. When A1 cells were cultured in serum-free medium for 18 h, the basal level of ERK phosphorylation was very low, irrespective of whether the cells were plated on vitronectin, fibronectin, type-1 collagen, or poly-l-lysine (Fig. 1). Treatment with 10 nm human SuPAR for 2 min activated ERK in quiescent A1 cells, and the extent of activation was similar under each of the culture conditions. MEF-2 cells are murine and LRP-1-deficient. These cells have increased levels of uPA and uPAR and establish autocrine signaling in serum-free medium so that the basal level of activated ERK is elevated (13Ma Z. Thomas K.S. Webb D.J. Moravec R. Salicioni A.M. Mars W.M. Gonias S.L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 1061-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 52Weaver A.M. Hussaini I.M. Mazar A. Henkin J. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14372-14379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Similarly, MDA-MB 231 breast cancer cells express large amounts of uPA and uPAR, which form an autocrine signaling loop to maintain an elevated level of activated ERK under serum-free conditions (53Ma Z. Webb D.J. Jo M. Gonias S.L. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3387-3396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In both of these cells lines, SuPAR (10 nm, 2 min) actually decreased ERK phosphorylation, and this result was extracellular matrix protein-independent. One explanation for these results is that SuPAR scavenges uPA and prevents uPA binding to membrane-anchored uPAR. However, in experiments with MEF-2 cells, human SuPAR cannot scavenge murine uPA, eliminating this mechanism in favor of a model in which SuPAR suppresses ERK activation by direct interaction with the cells. The Effects of SuPAR on ERK Activation Are Sustained— ERK activation by uPA may be highly transient. In MCF-7 breast cancer cells, the response is sustained for 5 min or less; however, this duration of response is sufficient to induce long-lived effects on cell migration (10Nguyen D.H. Hussaini I.M. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8502-8507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Cell growth and the rate of apoptosis are not affected by uPA in MCF-7 cells, consistent with the work of others demonstrating the requirement for sustained ERK phosphorylation for cells to enter the S phase (54Weber J.D. Raben D.M. Phillips P.J. Baldassare J.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 55Balmanno K. Cook S.J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3085-3097Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Fig. 2A shows that ERK activation by SuPAR in uPAR-deficient A1 MEFs is sustained through 60 min. As a second cell culture model system in which the cells do not express uPAR, we studied HEK 293 cells (17Resnati M. Pallavicini I. Wang J.M. Oppenheim J. Serhan C.N. Romano M. Blasi F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1359-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Again, SuPAR activated ERK, and the response was sustained. Suppression of ERK activation by SuPAR, in LRP-1-deficient MEF-2 cells, was also sustained, without apparent change through 60 min (the time course of the complete experiment). We also explored the SuPAR concentration dependence of ERK activation and deactivation. SuPAR, at a concentration of 10 pm, consistently activated ERK in A1 MEFs (Fig. 2B). Maximum ERK activation was observed with SuPAR at concentrations from 0.1 to 10 nm. Similarly, in experiments with MEF-2 cells, inhibition of ERK activation was consistently observed with 10 pm SuPAR. These results indicate that fairly low concentrations of SuPAR are sufficient to directly regulate cell signaling. Because SuPAR induced sustained changes in ERK activation, we undertook experiments to examine the potential of SuPAR to regulate cell growth. We measured cell growth using the MTT assay, which determines the total number of viable cells. As shown in Fig. 3, SuPAR increased A1 MEF proliferation by 2.2-fold in 48 h (p < 0.05, n = 8). By contrast, in MEF-2 and MDA-MB 231 cells, SuPAR essentially blocked cell growth over the same time period. Thus, the effects of SuPAR on cell growth correlate with its effects on the level of ERK activation. SuPAR may also have promoted apoptosis in MEF-2 and MDA-MB 231 cells. This effect would have been indistinguishable from growth inhibition by MTT assay. SuPAR Cleavage by Proteinase Reverses Its Inhibitory Activity—Chymotrypsin cleaves SuPAR in the linker region between D1 and D2 + D3, revealing the sequence, SRSRY, as the new N terminus of D2. Because of this activity, chymotrypsin serves as a model of proteinases that activate SuPAR for cell signaling (30Resnati M. Guttinger M. Valcamonica S. Sidenius N. Blasi F. Fazioli F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1572-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 31Fazioli F. Resnati M. Sidenius N. Higashimoto Y. Appella E. Blasi F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7279-7286Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). We performed experiments to determine whether cleavage of SuPAR by chymotrypsin reverses its activity as an inhibitor of ERK activation and cell growth. Fig. 4A shows that chymotrypsin completely cleaved SuPAR, generating new bands with the anticipated mobilities of D1 and D2 + D3. CSuPAR and SuPAR activated ERK equivalently in uPAR–/– A1 MEFs, indicating that the proteinase-cleaved product was active (Fig. 4B). In control experiments, the chymotrypsin, which was used to cleave SuPAR, had no effect on ERK activation in A1 MEFs, when added alone (data not shown). The chymotrypsin was treated with PMSF before incubation with the cells, following the protocol used to prepare CSuPAR. In MEF-2 cells and MDA-MB 231 cells, SuPAR and CSuPAR yielded different results. After incubation with cells for 2 min, SuPAR decreased ERK phosphorylation as already described; however, in multiple experiments, CSuPAR either had no effect on or slightly increased ERK phosphorylation. Equivalent results were obtained when the time of incubation with CSuPAR was extended (data not shown). Because CSuPAR did not inhibit ERK activation, in MEF-2 and MDA-MB 231 cells, we tested its effects on cell growth. As anticipated, CSuPAR did not inhibit growth of the MEF-2 and MDA-MB 231 cells (Fig. 5). Thus, SuPAR cleavage neutralizes its ability to function as an inhibitor of ERK"

At the present time there is little information about activation of this pathway and the consequences of its inhibition in acute lymphocytic leukemia cells (ALL). In the present study, constitutive MAPK pathway activation, as evidenced by phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2, was observed in 8 of 8 human lymphoid cell lines and 33% (8:24) of pretreatment ALL bone marrows. Inhibition of this pathway by the MEK inhibitors CI-1040 and PD098059 induced apoptosis through a unique pathway involving dephosphorylation and aggregation of Fas-associated death domain protein followed by death receptor-independent caspase-8 activation. Jurkat cell variants lacking Fas-associated death domain protein or procaspase-8 were resistant to CI-1040-induced apoptosis, as were Jurkat or Molt3 cells treated with the O-methyl ester of the caspase-8 inhibitor N-(Nα-benzyloxycarbonylisoleucylglutamyl) aspartate fluoromethyl ketone. In contrast, CI-1040-induced apoptosis was unaffected by blocking anti-Fas antibody, soluble tumor necrosis factor-α-related apoptosis-inducing ligand decoy receptor, or transfection with cDNA encoding the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Mcl-1 or dominant negative caspase-9.

Additional studies have demonstrated that CI-1040 (previously designated PD184352), an orally bioavailable MEK inhibitor derived from a chemical series structurally distinct from PD098059, inhibits ERK phosphorylation in colon cancer xenografts for up to 12 h after administration to tumor-bearing mice (19Sebolt-Leopold J.S.

Investig. 2001; 108: 851-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) have demonstrated constitutive ERK activation in 50–70% of clinical AML specimens. Importantly, ERK phosphorylation correlates with the ability of CI-1040 to induce apoptosis in AML in vitro (22Milella M. Kornblau S.M. Estrov Z. Carter B.Z. Lapillonne H. Harris D. Konopleva M. Zhao S. Estey E. Andreeff M. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 851-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). In AML cell lines, CI-1040-induced apoptosis is preceded by a p27Kip1-mediated G1 arrest and by down-regulation of the anti-apoptotic proteins Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL (22Milella M. Kornblau S.M. Estrov Z.

The latter changes suggest that CI-1040 might induce apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway, a series of reactions involving cytochrome c translocation to the cytoplasm, ATP-dependent assembly of the procaspase-9/Apaf-1 holoenzyme, and subsequent proteolytic activation of caspases-3, -6, and -7 (reviewed in Refs. 23Slee E.A.

Biol. 1999; 15: 269-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (2249) Google Scholar). Potential involvement of other caspases in MEK inhibitor-induced killing has not been examined previously.Because the number of ALL specimens examined previously was limited, less is known about MAPK pathway activation in this disorder. ALL occurs about 1/3 as often as AML in adults and remains a difficult malignancy to treat. Most adult ALL patients respond to initial therapy but then relapse and die of this disease (25Litzow M.R. Curr. Treat. Options Oncol. 2000; 1: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 26Velders M.P. ter Horst S.A. Kast W.M.

Am. 2001; 15: 97-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Accordingly, there is considerable interest in identifying mechanisms of drug resistance and developing new therapies for this disorder.In the present study, we examined the biochemical consequences of MAPK inhibition in ALL. In particular, in view of data presented below showing constitutive ERK phosphorylation in clinical ALL samples, we examined the effect of the MEK inhibitor CI-1040 on cell cycle progression and survival in lymphoid cell lines. Results of these studies differed substantially from previously reported effects of MEK inhibition in solid tumor and AML cell lines. In particular, CI-1040 induced S phase arrest in 6 of 8 lymphoid cell lines examined. This was followed by FADD dephosphorylation and aggregation, which led to receptor-independent caspase-8 activation. Collectively, these observations indicate that the MAPK pathway is frequently activated in ALL cells and identify a novel mechanism by which MEK inhibitors can kill these cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—The broad spectrum caspase inhibitor ZVAD(OMe)-fmk (28Garcia-Calvo M.

After treatment, cells were harvested for assessment of cell cycle distribution and apoptosis.To determine cell cycle distribution, cells were sedimented at 200 × g for 10 min, washed in ice-cold calcium- and magnesium-free Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in 50% ethanol, treated with RNase A, and stained with 50 μg/ml propidium iodide in 0.1% sodium citrate (34Bible K.

After 20,000 cells were analyzed on a FACScan flow cytometer using an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and an emission wavelength of 617 nm, data were analyzed using ModFit software (BD Biosciences).Apoptosis was assessed by using one of two techniques. For morphological analysis, cells were sedimented at 200 × g for 10 min, fixed in 3:1 (v/v) methanol/acetic acid, stained with 1 μg/ml Hoechst 33258 in 50% (v/v) glycerol, and examined under epi-illumination using a Zeiss Axioplan microscope. At least 300 cells/sample were scored for apoptotic changes (peripheral chromatin condensation or nuclear fragmentation) as illustrated previously (35Martins L.M. Mesner P.W. Kottke T.J. Basi G.S.

Alternatively, the sedimented cells were subjected to flow microfluorimetry essentially as described above. After 10,000 events were collected, data were analyzed for the percentage of subdiploid cells using CellQuest software (Verity Software House, Topsham, ME). In experiments where both methods of quantitating apoptotic cells were employed, the results agreed within 3–5%.Samples for immunoblotting were treated with CI-1040 for the indicated length of time. For whole cell lysates, cells were sedimented at 200 × g for 10 min, washed in buffer A (RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4 at 4 °C)), lysed in alkylation buffer (6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 250 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5 at 21 °C), and 10 mm EDTA supplemented before use with 1 mm α-phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 150 mm β-mercaptoethanol), and prepared for SDS-PAGE as described previously (36Kaufmann S.H.

To evaluate FADD solubility, washed cells were extracted at 4 °C for 15 min with DISC buffer (1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5 at 4 °C), 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm α-phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 mm NaF, 1 mm Na2VO4, 20 nm microcystin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin and pepstatin A) and sedimented at 15,000 × g for 15 min. Aliquots containing 50 μg of total cellular protein or the Triton-soluble versus -insoluble fractions were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and probed with antibodies as described above. To assess caspase activation, cytosol (100,000 × g supernatant) was prepared and incubated with DEVD-AFC exactly as described (31Eischen C.M. Kottke T.J. Martins L.M. Basi G.S. Tung J.S.

After washing, cells were incubated with phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-mouse IgG for an additional 30 min on ice. Following washing, cells were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde and stored in the dark at 4 °C until analyzed by flow cytometry.Transient Transfections—Plasmids encoding EGFP alone (pEGFPN1), a dominant negative caspase-9/EGFP fusion protein, a dominant negative FADD/EGFP fusion protein, or Mcl-1 were obtained from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA), Emad Alnemri (Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia), Greg Gores (Mayo Clinic), and Ruth Craig (Dartmouth Medical School.

After a 24-h incubation, 30–45% of the cells displayed green fluorescence. The brightest 10–12% of the total cell population was isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting, exposed to drug or diluent as indicated in each figure legend, fixed, and examined for apoptotic morphological changes.RT-PCR—After log phase Jurkat cells were treated with 10 μm CI-1040 for the indicated length of time, total RNA was isolated (RNeasy™ mini kit, Qiagen, Valencia, CA). cDNAs were synthesized using a Superscript™ First-strand Synthesis kit (Invitrogen). One-twentieth of the cDNA product was used for each amplification reaction.Using the primers described in Table I, PCRs were performed using Expand™ high fidelity PCR reagents from Roche Applied Science following the supplier's instructions. Following amplification, products were electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide in 1× TAE buffer (30.7 mm Tris, 20 mm sodium acetate, and 1 mm EDTA), visualized on a UV transilluminator, and sequenced to confirm their identity.Table IPrimers used for RT-PCRTranscriptForward primerReverse primerβ-Actin5′-TCCTGTGGCATCCACGAAACT-3′5′-ATCGTCCACCGCAAATGCTTC-3′c-Myc5′-CTACTGCGACGAGGAGGAGAAC-3′5′-CGCAGATGAAACTCTGGTTCAC-3′Cdc25a5′-AGCCCCAAAGAGTCAACTAATCCAGA-3′5′-CCGGTAGCTAGGGGGCTCACA-3′p27Kip15′-GAGGACACGCATTTGGTGG-3′5′-GAGGCAGATCATTTAAGAGTG-3′p215′-CCTGCCGAAGTCAGTTCC-3′5′-CTGTGGGCGGATTAGGGC-3′Mcl-15′-CGGTAATCGGACTCAACCTC-3′5′-CCTCCTTCTCCGTAGCCAA-3′Bcl-25′-CTGAAGAGGACCTGGACC-3′5′-ACAATTGCAGAGCCATAGG-3′Bcl-xL5′-TGGCACCTGGCAGACAGC-3′5′-CGGAGGATGTGGTGGAGC-3′TNF-R15′-ACCAAGTGCCACAAAGGAAC-3′5′-TCTGGCGTAGGCACAACTTC-3′TNF-αaTNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α5′-AGCCCATGTTGTAGCAAACC-3′5′-GGAAGACCCCTCCCAGATAG-3′Fas5′-CAAGGGATTGGAATTGAGGA-3′5′-GACAAAGCCACCCCAAGTTA-3′Fas ligand5′-GGCCTGTGTCTCCTTGTGAT-3′5′-TCATCATCTTCCCCTCCATC-3′DR45′-CTGAGCAACGCAGACTCGCTGTCCAC-3′5′-TCCAAGGACACGGCAGAGCCTGTGCCAT-3′DR55′-GCCTCATGGACAATGAGATAAAGGTGGCT-3′5′-CCAAATCTCAAAGTACGCACAAACGG-3′TRAIL5′-GGAACCCAAGGTGGGTAGAT-3′5′-TCTCACCACACTGCAACCTC-3′GAPDHbGAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase5′-GGCAAATTCCATGGCACCGTCAGG-3′5′-GGAGGCATTGCTGATGATCCTGAGG-3′a TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-αb GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase Open table in a new tab Clinical Samples—In conjunction with an institutional review board-approved treatment protocol (39Kaufmann S.H. Karp J.E. Burke P.J. Gore S.D. Leuk. & Lymphoma. 1996; 23: 71-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), heparinized bone marrow aspirates were obtained from the posterior iliac crests of newly diagnosed ALL patients prior to the initiation of induction chemotherapy. Within 2 h of aspiration, samples were sedimented on ficoll-Hypaque step gradients (density = 1.077 and 1.119 g/cm3). Cells collected from the upper interface were diluted with buffer A, sedimented at 200 × g for 10 min, and resuspended in buffer A. After aliquots were removed for counting and cytospins, samples were sedimented at 200 × g for 10 min, solubilized in alkylation buffer, prospectively prepared for electrophoresis as described above, and lyophilized in multiple single-use vials (36Kaufmann S.H. Svingen P.A. Gore S.D. Armstrong D.K. Cheng Y.-C. Rowinsky E.K. Blood. 1997; 89: 2098-2104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Aliquots containing 5 × 105 marrow mononuclear cells were subjected to electrophoresis on gels containing a 5–15% acrylamide gradient. To provide a positive control, HL-60 cells, which are known to have constitutively phosphorylated ERK1 and ERK2 (40Meighan-Mantha R.L. Wellstein A. Riegel A.T. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 234: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), were prepared for electrophoresis in an identical fashion. After SDS-PAGE, samples were transferred to nitrocellulose and probed with primary antibodies followed by horse-radish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies as described previously (41Kaufmann S.H. Kellner U. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 80: 223-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Blots were quantified on a FluorS Max Multimaging System (Bio-Rad) and considered positive for ERK phosphorylation if the integrated phospho-ERK signal was ≥20% of the total ERK signal.RESULTSMAPK Pathway Activation in Lymphoid Cell Lines and Clinical ALL—To assess MAPK pathway activation in lymphoid cells, whole cell lysates were subjected to immunoblotting with a rabbit antiserum that specifically recognizes dually phosphorylated ERK1 and ERK2. In contrast to solid tumor cell lines, some of which fail to exhibit constitutive MAPK activation (19Sebolt-Leopold J.S. Dudley D.T. Herrera R. Van Becelaere K. Wiland A. Gowan R.C. Tecle H. Barrett S.D. Bridges A. Przybranowski S. Leopold W.R. Saltiel A.R. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 810-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar), immunoblotting readily demonstrated phosphorylated ERK1 and ERK2 in all lymphoid cell lines examined (Fig. 1A and data not shown). Collectively, these lymphoid lines provide a model system to examine the effect of MEK inhibition in the studies described below.To determine whether the MAPK pathway is also constitutively activated in the clinical setting, 24 pretreatment ALL bone marrow samples that contained >80% blasts + lymphocytes (median 88% blasts) and additional samples from patients with other leukemias were examined using identical techniques. Results of this analysis are summarized in Table II. Constitutive MAPK activation was not detectable in specimens of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (Table II), an indolent lymphoid malignancy with an extremely low proliferative index. In contrast, 12 of 33 ALL marrows displayed constitutive ERK phosphorylation, as illustrated in Fig. 1B. Reprobing of the same blots with antiserum that recognized ERK regardless of phosphorylation state confirmed the presence of ERK1 and ERK2 in all samples at similar levels (Fig. 1B, middle panel). Collectively, these results not only provide evidence for MAPK activation in 1/3 of pretreatment ALL samples but also demonstrate that this activation is independent of ERK overexpression, a factor that has been implicated in MAPK activation in some AML samples (21Kim S.-C. Hahn J.-S. Min Y.-H. Yoo N.-C. Ko Y.-W. Lee W.-J.

In order to determine the retrograde role of muscle in regulating the expression of AChE in motor neuron, a chimeric co-culture of NG108-15 cell, a cholinergic cell line that resembles motor neuron, with chick myotube was established to mimic the neuromuscular contact in vitro. A DNA construct of human AChE promoter tagged with luciferase (pAChE-Luc) was stably transfected into NG108-15 cells. The co-culture with myotubes robustly stimulated the promoter activity as well as the endogenous expression of AChE in pAChE-Luc stably transfected NG108-15 cells. Muscle extract derived from chick embryos when applied onto pAChE-Luc-expressing NG108-15 cells induced expressions of AChE promoter and endogenous AChE. The cAMP-responsive element mutation on human AChE promoter blocked the muscle-induced AChE transcriptional activity in cultured NG108-15 cells either in co-culturing with myotube or in applying muscle extract. The accumulation of intracellular cAMP and the phosphorylation of cAMP-responsive element-binding protein in cultured NG108-15 cells were stimulated by applied muscle extract. Part of the muscle-induced signaling was mimicked by application of calcitonin gene-related peptide in cultured NG108-15 cells.

Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 911-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). A single gene encodes this enzyme, and adult mammalian muscles express a single gene variant, corresponding to the catalytic subunit of type T (AChET) (1Massoulié J. Pezzementi L. Bon S. Krejci E. Vallette F.-M. Prog. Neurobiol. 1993; 41: 31-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). AChE is restricted to the nmj at a density of ∼650–2500 sites/μm2 (4Anglister L. Stiles J.R. Salpeter M.M. Neuron. 1994; 12: 783-794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) that is mainly contributed by muscle enzyme and mediated by agrin that induces the aggregation of AChE and acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) under the motor nerve (5Sanes J.R. Lichtman J.W. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 389-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (1235) Google Scholar). The motor nerve provides trophic factors to regulate the postsynaptic AChE expression in muscle; these neural factors include calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) that increases the synthesis of cAMP (6Fontaine B.

Lett. 1997; 236: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Although muscle is the primary source of all forms of AChE at the nmj, two other cell types, presynaptic motor neuron and myelinating Schwann cell, also contribute to the synaptic AChE activity, but to a lower extent (1Massoulié J. Pezzementi L. Bon S. Krejci E. Vallette F.-M. Prog. Neurobiol. 1993; 41: 31-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). The contribution of synaptic AChE from the myelinating Schwann cell, if any, is limited (15Anglister L. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 755-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence indicate that the presynaptic motor neuron is able to synthesize and secrete AChE at the nmj. In frog nmjs, the muscle was permanently removed by x-ray irradiation and all of the synaptic AChE activity was irreversibly blocked by an AChE inhibitor, but the motor axons were kept intact. After a month in the absence of postsynaptic muscle fiber, the AChE activity was recovered, indicating that the motor nerve was capable of producing part of the AChE activity at the synaptic cleft (15Anglister L. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 755-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In chicks, a globular form of AChE is expressed in the presynaptic motor neurons, which is down-regulated toward maturity and by nerve denervation (16Tsim K.W.K. Choi R.C.Y. Dong T.T.X. Wan D.C.C. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 479-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 17Wan D.C.C. Ng Y.P. Choi R.C.Y. Cheung W.T. Dong T.T.X. Tsim K.W.K. Neurosci. Lett. 1997; 232: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). In addition, both asymmetric and globular forms of AChE are entirely transported by fast axonal flow in the sciatic nerve of chicken (18Goemaere-Vanneste J. Couraud J.-Y. Hassig R. Di Giamberardino L. van den Bosch de Aguilar P. J. Neurochem. 1988; 51: 1746-1754Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Moreover, AChE at the nerve terminus is secreted in an activity-dependent manner (1Massoulié J. Pezzementi L. Bon S. Krejci E. Vallette F.-M. Prog. Neurobiol. 1993; 41: 31-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar, 19Brimijoin S. Skau K.A. Wiermaa M.J. J. Physiol. 1978; 285: 143-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Having the aforementioned evidence, the possibility that motor neuron-derived AChE may play functional roles at the nmj is still an open question. The transcriptional activity of the AChE gene has been demonstrated to play a role in AChE regulation, and several regulatory elements within the promoter have been reported to regulate the transcriptional activity of AChE gene in Torpedo (20Ekström T.J.

Among these possible AChE regulatory elements, a cAMP-responsive element (CRE) site located on the human AChE promoter has been shown to regulate the level of AChE transcripts in muscle (25Choi R.C.Y.

Here, we would like to determine the regulation mechanism of neuronal AChE mediated by the interacting muscle in a co-culture system of neuroblastoma × glioma hybrid cells NG108-15 with chick myotubes; this co-culture has been used to resemble the formation of nmjs in vitro previously (14Choi R.C.Y.

By using a luciferase-tagged human AChE promoter construct as a tool, the transcriptional element that mediated the muscle-induced neuronal AChE expression in the neuron-muscle co-culture was elucidated. The gene activation was demonstrated to be mediated by a cAMP-dependent signaling pathway. Tissue Cultures—Eggs of New Hampshire chicks were purchased from a local farm and hatched in the University Animal Care Facility. In primary chick myotube cultures, hind limb muscles dissected from 11-day-old chick embryos were minced and then dissociated by trypsinization, stirring, and centrifugation (29Pun S. Tsim K.W.K. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1997; 10: 87-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Muscle cells were routinely cultured in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum, 2% chick embryo extract, 1 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cell culture medium, fetal bovine serum, and other cell culture reagents were from Invitrogen. The cultures were incubated at 37 °C in a water-saturated incubator of 95% air and 5% CO2. Myotubes were treated with mitotic inhibitor (10–5m cytosine arabinoside) at day 3 after plating. Mouse C2C12 muscle cells were obtained from the ATCC (Manassas, VA). Undifferentiated C2C12 myoblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Invitrogen) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and incubated at 37 °C in a water-saturated incubator of 95% air and 5% CO2. About 3 × 105 C2C12 myoblasts were allowed to grow in 12-well tissue culture plates for 2 days in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin until confluent. They were then induced to differentiate into myotubes by replacing the growth medium in DMEM supplemented with 2% heat-inactivated horse serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (26Siow N.L. Choi R.C.Y. Cheng A.W.M. Jiang J.X.S. Wan D.C.C. Zhu S.Q. Tsim K.W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36129-36136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Mouse neuroblastoma × rat glioma NG108-15 cells were cultured in 100-mm culture dishes as described (28Busis N.A. Daniels M.P. Bauer H.C. Pudimat P.A. Sonderegger P. Schaffner A.E. Nirenberg M. Brain Res. 1984; 324: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Undifferentiated NG108-15 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 5–10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and incubated at 37 °C in a water-saturated incubator of 95% air and 5% CO2. Stably transfected NG108-15 cells were treated for 48 h with muscle extract at different concentrations or with dibutyryl cyclic AMP (Bt2cAMP; 1 mm) or forskolin (50 μm in Me2SO). These drugs were purchased from Sigma. The fresh medium or medium together with the muscle extract/drug treatment was renewed every day. NG108-15 cells were added at different cell density onto the 4–5-day-old chick myotubes or C2C12 myotubes. The co-culture was carried out for 2–3 days, and the medium was changed daily. For control cultures, equal amount of NG108-15 cells were added onto a 12-well plate in the myotube culture medium but without myotubes; the myotube medium showed a weak effect on the neuronal differentiation of cultured NG108-15 cells. To determine the effect of neuron-muscle contact, a cell culture insert with pore size of 0.4 μm (BD Biosciences Clontech) was employed. In brief, chick myotubes were allowed to grow inside the cell culture insert and placed onto a 6-well plate that contained NG108-15 cells. The numbers of NG108-15 cell in both control and co-culture groups were counted by a microscope before the cell collection. 20 different views were randomly selected for each well. cDNA Transfection—The ∼2.2-kb DNA fragment of human AChE promoter (24Ben Aziz-Aloya R.

This ∼2.2-kb regulatory element was shown to reflect the genuine situation of AChE regulation in a C2C12 cell; the activity of this promoter was in parallel with the endogenous AChE expression during the myogenic differentiation of C2C12 myotube (26Siow N.L. Choi R.C.Y. Cheng A.W.M. Jiang J.X.S. Wan D.C.C. Zhu S.Q. Tsim K.W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36129-36136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The 2.1-kb mouse AChE promoter, generated by PCR using the published sequence as described in Li et al. (21Li Y. Camp S. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5790-5797Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was tagged with luciferase and designated as pAChEm-Luc. The DNA construct of CRE sequence tagged with a luciferase (pCRE-Luc), AP-1 sequence tagged with a luciferase (pAP-1-Luc), and NF-κB sequence tagged with a luciferase (pNFκB-Luc) were from BD Biosciences Clontech. Double-stranded oligonucleotides containing four repeats of the intact CRE sequence (–2194CAC GTC A–2188; 5′ to 3′) derived from human AChE promoter were subcloned into pTA-Luc luciferase reporter vector (BD Biosciences Clontech) to form pCREHp-Luc. For pAP-2-Luc construction, double-stranded oligonucleotides containing four repeats of the intact AP-2 binding sequences (–1626GCC GGA GGC–1634; 5′ to 3′) derived from human AChE promoter were subcloned into pTA-Luc vector. The construct of β-galactosidase gene under a cytomegalovirus promoter (pCMV-β-gal) from BD Biosciences Clontech was used as a control vector. For the construction having AChE as a reporter, the human AChE promoter was tagged upstream of a cDNA encoding the chick AChE catalytic subunit (14Choi R.C.Y. Pun S. Dong T.T. Wan D.C. Tsim K.W.K. Neurosci. Lett. 1997; 236: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) to form the pAChE-cAChE construct. DNAs encoding various constructs were purified by a Qiagen column, and they were stably transfected into NG108-15 cells by calcium phosphate precipitation method (29Pun S. Tsim K.W.K. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1997; 10: 87-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). All of the expression plasmids contained a G418-resistant gene as described by the supplier. G418-resistant stable cell lines were selected in medium containing 400 μg/ml G418 (Geneticin; Invitrogen) and tested for the expression of luciferase. Normally, four or five stable cell lines were generated for each DNA construct. For transient transfection, pCMV-β-gal was co-transfected with others, serving as a control, in determining the transfection efficiency that was normally over 50% in the cultured NG108-15 cells. Preparation of Muscle Extract—1 g of hind limb muscle dissected from 19-day-old chick embryos was homogenized in 5 ml of ice-cold DMEM containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride by a Polytron homogenizer (Ultra-Turrax T25; Labortecknik) with 24,000 rpm for 1 min three times, followed by centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was excluded when the cultured cells were being used for the AChE enzymatic assay. The supernatant was filtered by a 0.2-μm filter and freshly used within the same day. NG108-15 cells were treated with the extracts at different protein concentrations from 0.125 to 1.0 mg/ml culture medium. Immunoblotting and Phosphorylation Assay—Neuron-muscle co-cultures or muscle extract-treated NG 108-15 cell cultures in 12-well culture plates were homogenized in 0.3 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.5% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mg/ml bacitracin, and 1 m NaCl, followed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Protein samples were denatured in 100 °C for 5 min in a buffer containing 1% SDS and 1% dithiothreitol and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In phosphorylation analyses of cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB), cultures were washed with 1 mm Na3VO4/phosphate-buffered saline, followed by the addition of 200 μl of lysis buffer containing 50 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm Na3VO4 (pH 8.0), 5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% SDS for lysis. Lysates were collected and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 2 min at 4 °C. Fifty μl of supernatant was used in SDS-PAGE. Proteins from the gel were electroblotted (Bio-Rad Mini-Protean II transblot system) onto nitrocellulose paper for 16 h (16Tsim K.W.K. Choi R.C.Y. Dong T.T.X. Wan D.C.C. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 479-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The blot was absorbed with blocking agent of 5% nonfat milk powder in Tris-buffered saline-Tween (20 mm Tris base, 137 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.6). The chemiluminescence method was used according to the ECL protocol provided by the supplier (Amersham Biosciences). The anti-mouse AChE polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) was used at a 1:1,000 dilution. Anti-chick AChE catalytic subunit (ACB-1) monoclonal antibody from hybridoma cells was used (16Tsim K.W.K. Choi R.C.Y. Dong T.T.X. Wan D.C.C. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 479-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and the antibody was purified from hybridoma medium using protein G-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). The working concentration of protein-G purified primary antibody for AChE was 5–10 μg/ml. The anti-neurofilament 200 and anti-α-tubulin antibodies were from Sigma and were used at a 1:5,000 dilution. The anti-SNAP-25 monoclonal antibody (BD Biosciences) was used at a 1:2,000 dilution. The anti-phospho-CREB and total CREB antibodies (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) were in a 1:1,000 dilution. The peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:5,000) were from Cappel (Belgium). The immunocomplexes were visualized using the ECL method (Amersham Biosciences). The intensities of the bands were compared on an image analyzer, using in each case a calibration plot constructed from a parallel gel with serial dilutions of one of those samples. The intensity of the recognized protein band was determined by a densitometer. Sucrose Density Gradient—Separation of various molecular forms of AChE was performed by sucrose density gradient analysis according to previous study (30Tsim K.W.K. Randall W.R. Barnard E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1262-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). 5–20% sucrose gradients were prepared on a 0.5-ml cushion of 60% sucrose in 12-ml polyallomer tubes. Sucrose gradients were in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 m NaCl. Cell extract (∼0.1 ml) was loaded onto the gradient. Centrifugation was run for 16 h at 38,000 rpm by a Sorvall TH 641 rotor at 4 °C. Sedimentation markers (catalase, 11.4 S; β-galactosidase, 16 S) were used for calibration of the gradient. About 40 fractions were collected for AChE enzymatic activity determination. cAMP Accumulation Assay—The NG108-15 cell cultures were cultured in 35-mm culture dishes. After a 30-min treatment of chick muscle extract, or CGRP, the cell cultures were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and collected in 1 ml of 4 mm EDTA containing 50 μm 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine followed by boiling for 4 min, and the cell debris was removed by centrifugation. 50 μl of the supernatant was assayed for cAMP using the cAMP assay kit from Amersham Biosciences. Assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Drug Treatments—To determine the role of muscle in affecting the transcription and translation of AChE synthesis, cultured NG108-15 cells were pretreated with 10 μm actinomycin D (a transcription inhibitor) and 20 μm cycloheximide (a translation inhibitor; both from Sigma) for 1 h, followed by the treatment of 1 mg/ml muscle extract for 10 h. Rat αCGRP and αCGRP8–37 (an antagonist of CGRP receptor) were purchased from Sigma. They were stored at 0.5 mm in H2O. 1 nm to 10 μm of CGRP was used to induce the cyclic AMP accumulation and the CREB phosphorylation in cultured NG108-15 cells. 30 μm CGRP8–37 was used to block the phosphorylation of CREB, which was induced by 3 μm CGRP or 0.5 mg/ml muscle extract, respectively. In the blocking experiment, NG108-15 cells were pretreated with CGRP8–37 for 1 h before the application of CGRP or muscle extract. Other Assays—The protein concentration was measured routinely by Bradford's method (31Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar) with a kit from Bio-Rad. The luciferase assay was performed according to the kit supplied (Tropix Inc., Bedford, MA). In brief, cell cultures were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 0.2% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.8). 30 μl of lysate per sample was used in luciferase assay. The luminescent reaction was quantified by Tropix TR717 microplate luminometer (Tropix), and the activity was expressed in absorbance per mg of protein. The activity of AChE was assayed by the method of Ellman et al. (32Ellman G.L. Courtney K.D. Andres Jr., V. Featherstone R.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1961; 7: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (21516) Google Scholar) in a medium containing 0.1 mm tetraisopropylpyrophosphoramide as an inhibitor of butyrylcholinesterase as described (30Tsim K.W.K. Randall W.R. Barnard E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1262-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Values of AChE or of luciferase were calculated per single well of cells in the co-culture or per μg of protein in the stable cells. Statistical tests were made by the PRIMER program (60Glantz S.A. Primer of Biostatistics, version 1. McGraw-Hill, Inc., 1988Google Scholar), and differences from basal or control values (as shown in the plots) were classified as highly significant (**) where p < 0.001. Induction of Neuronal AChE Expression in Neuron-Muscle Co-culture—The co-culture of cholinergic NG108-15 cells with chick myotubes could resemble the formation of nmjs in vitro. Having co-cultured with myotubes, NG108-15 cells were induced to differentiate, and neurite outgrowth was revealed (Fig. 1A). Both myotube and NG108-15 cells are able to express AChE in the co-culture. In order to discriminate the source of AChE in the neuron-muscle co-culture, a mammal-specific anti-AChE antibody was used, which recognized AChE from NG108-15 cells. A molecular mass of ∼68 kDa on SDS gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1B) corresponding to the catalytic subunit of mouse AChE was revealed only from NG108-15 cells (14Choi R.C.Y. Pun S. Dong T.T. Wan D.C. Tsim K.W.K. Neurosci. Lett. 1997; 236: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 27Wan D.C.C. Choi R.C.Y. Siow N.L. Tsim K.W.K. Neurosci. Lett. 2000; 288: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar); the muscle-derived AChE (chick) was not recognized by the mammal-specific antibody (Fig. 1B). AChE in chick myotube, recognized by the chick-specific antibody, had a molecular mass of ∼105 kDa. By using the species-specific anti-AChE antibody, the expression of neuronal AChE was found to increase over 4–6-fold by co-culturing with chick myotubes. In parallel, the expressions of neurofilament at ∼200 kDa (NF-200) and SNAP-25 at ∼25 kDa, specific markers of NG108-15 cell, were increased over 3–6-fold in the co-culture (Fig. 1, C and D), indicating the muscle-induced neuronal differentiation of the cultured neurons. The amount of myoblasts used in the co-culture was optimized here to ensure a sufficient number of myotubes formed; a higher number of myotubes showed inhibition to the growth of added NG108-15 cells (data not shown). Various amounts of NG108-15 cells were co-cultured with a constant amount of chick myotubes for 2 days in order to optimize the co-culture condition that could trigger higher induction of neuronal AChE (Fig. 1, C and D). A higher amount of NG108-15 cells did not show a better induction of neuronal AChE. When the intensities of stained bands were analyzed by a densitometer, the level of neuronal AChE expression was increased over 4-fold by co-culturing with 10,000 NG108-15 cells (Fig. 1D). In view of the possibility that the induced AChE expression could be due to rapid division of NG108-15 cells in the co-culture, the cell number of the NG108-15 cells was determined with or without the co-culture, which, however, did not show any significant variation (Fig. 1D). In contrast, the co-culture of NG108-15 cells with myotubes by using a culture insert of 0.4-μm pore size did not show any induction of these neuronal proteins (Fig. 1, C and D). Thus, a close proximity of neuron-muscle contact was required for activation of specific gene expression in NG108-15 cells. To further investigate the effect of muscle in inducing neuronal AChE expression, NG108-15 cells stably transfected with a construct of human AChE promoter (∼2.2 kb in length) tagged with luciferase (pAChE-Luc) were co-cultured with chick myotubes. Over 4-fold induction of luciferase activity was revealed when pAChE-Luc-expressing NG108-15 cells were co-cultured with myotubes; similar -fold induction was revealed at different concentrations of NG108-15 cell (Fig. 2A). The co-culture effect was also revealed when NG108-15 cells were transfected with a construct of luciferase-tagged mouse AChE promoter (∼2.1 kb), namely pAChEm-Luc (Fig. 2A). The muscle-induced AChE expression in NG108-15 cell was time-dependent; the induction reached a maximum at ∼5-fold for both human and mouse AChE promoters after 2 days of co-culture (Fig. 2B). As a control, stable NG108-15 cells transfected with a β-galactosidase gene driven under a cytomegalovirus promoter were co-cultured with myotubes; however, the expression of β-galactosidase remained unchanged (Fig. 2A), which indicated a specific effect of muscle on AChE promoter activity. The induction of AChE expression in the co-culture was specific for muscle regardless of the origin from chick or mouse, and the co-culture of pAChE-Luc stably expressed NG108-15 cells with COS-7 or HEK293 cells showed no induction effect (Fig. 2C). A cAMP-dependent Signaling Mediates Muscle-induced Neuronal AChE Expression—In order to determine the transcriptional element(s) that is responsible for the muscle-induced neuronal AChE expression, multiple copies of DNA sequences of different transcriptional elements, including CRE, AP-2, AP-1, and NF-κB, were tagged with luciferase in a mammalian expression vector as pCRE-Luc, pAP-2-Luc, pAP-1-Luc, and pNFκB-Luc, respectively. These constructs were stably transfected into NG108-15 cells and subsequently co-cultured with"

Each lineage is derived from the multipotent gastric stem cell and undergoes perpetual renewal within discrete mucosal invaginations (gastric units). In this report, we analyze the molecular features of ZCs and their contributions to gastric epithelial homeostasis. GeneChip analysis yielded a dataset of 57 mRNAs encoding known proteins and 14 ESTs enriched in adult mouse ZCs. This dataset, obtained from comparisons of cellular populations purified by counterflow elutriation and lectin panning, was validated by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR studies of the in vivo expression of selected genes using cells harvested from different regions of gastric units by laser capture microdissection. ZC-enriched mRNAs include regulators of angiogenesis (e.g. platelet-derived growth factors A and B). Because PCs are enriched in transcripts encoding other angiogenic factors (e.g. Vegfb), the contributions of these two lineages to vascular development was examined by performing quantitative three-dimensional imaging of the capillary networks that surround gastric units in two types of mice. In normal adult gnotobiotic FVB/N animals, network density is on average 2-fold higher in ZC- and PC-containing units located in the proximal (corpus) region of the stomach compared with units positioned in the distal (antral) region that lack these lineages (p < 0.01). Gnotobiotic transgenic mice with an engineered ablation of all ZCs and PCs have a 2-fold reduction in capillary network density in their corpus region gastric units compared with the corpus units of normal littermates (p < 0.01). These results support an emerging theme that angiogenesis in the adult mouse gut is modulated by cross-talk between its epithelial lineages and the underlying mesenchyme.

These results support an emerging theme that angiogenesis in the adult mouse gut is modulated by cross-talk between its epithelial lineages and the underlying mesenchyme. The human gastric epithelium is renewed continuously throughout life with an estimated 500,000 cells shed/min in adults (1Croft D.N. Pollock D.J. Coghill N.F. Gut. 1966; 7: 333-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Dysregulated renewal results in a number of disease states including gastric adenocarcinoma, the second most common cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide (2Murray C.J. Lopez A.D. Lancet. 1997; 349: 1269-1276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3418) Google Scholar). The mouse has been used as a model organism to characterize the cellular and molecular features of this renewal and to decipher its regulation. The proximal third of the mouse stomach (forestomach) is lined with a squamous epithelium, while its distal two-thirds is lined with a glandular epithelium. The glandular epithelium contains thousands of tubular mucosal invaginations known as gastric units. In the central or corpus region of the stomach, each unit has a steady-state population of ∼200 epithelial cells representing three principal lineages (pit, parietal, and zymogenic) and two minor lineages (enteroendocrine, and caveolated) (3Karam S.M. Leblond C.P. Anat. Rec. 1992; 232: 231-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). All of the lineages are derived from multipotent stem cells located in the mid-portion (isthmus) of each unit (Fig. 1, A-C) (4Bjerknes M. Cheng H. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: G767-G777Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 5Karam S.M. Leblond C.P. Anat. Rec. 1993; 236: 259-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar).

Mucus-producing pit cells derived from one of the stem cell's committed daughters differentiate during a rapid (3-day) migration from the stem cell niche located in the middle portion of the unit (isthmus) through the upper portion of the unit (pit region) to the surface epithelium where they are removed by apoptosis or necrosis (Fig. 1A) (7Karam S.M. Leblond C.P. Anat. Rec. 1993; 236: 280-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In contrast, members of the zymogenic cell lineage differentiate during a downward migration from the isthmus through the neck region to base of the unit. During this passage, they undergo a series of morphologic transitions from pre-neck to neck to pre-zymogenic and finally to mature zymogenic cells (Fig. 1, A, B, and D) (6Karam S.M. Leblond C.P. Anat. Rec. 1993; 236: 297-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Zymogenic cells (ZCs), 1The abbreviations used are: ZC, zymogenic cell; PC, parietal cell; GEP, gastric epithelial lineage progenitor; n-LCM, navigated form of laser capture microdissection; qRT-PCR, real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR; DBA, Dolichos biflorus agglutinin; GSII, Griffonia simplifolia II lectin; AAA, Anguilla anguilla agglutinin; Igf, insulin-like growth factor; Igfbp, Igf-binding protein; Pdgf, platelet-derived growth factor; Pdgfr, Pdgf receptor; Vegf, vascular endothelial growth factor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; EM, electron microscopy. also known as chief cells, are cleared at the base of the unit via necrosis and apoptosis or are phagocytosed by neighboring cells. The zymogenic lineage turns over every 190 days (6Karam S.M. Leblond C.P. Anat. Rec. 1993; 236: 297-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Unlike pit and zymogenic cells, acid-secreting parietal cells (PCs) differentiate within the isthmus (8Karam S.M. Anat. Rec. 1993; 236: 314-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 10Karam S.M. Li Q. Gordon J.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G1209-G1220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1. A, B, and E). PCs then migrate up through the pit region where they are eliminated by necrosis, exfoliation, or phagocytosis, or down to the base where they are removed by apoptosis or phagocytosis. The average lifespan of members of this lineage is 54 days (8Karam S.M. Anat. Rec. 1993; 236: 314-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). We have embarked on a mouse gastric genome anatomy project (mG-GAP) (see Ref. 11Mills J.C. Syder A.J. Hong C.V. Guruge J.L. Raaii F. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13687-13692Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, genome.wustl.edu/GSCGAP/, and www.scgap.org) to delineate the molecular features of these epithelial lineages with the goal of identifying new mediators/regulators of their renewal, new insights regarding their functions, and new perspectives regarding gastric physiology. To date, PCs and isthmal gastric epithelial progenitors (GEPs) have been characterized using a variety of functional genomics methods. Studies of PCs purified by lectin panning from the stomachs of normal adult mice belonging to the FVB/N inbred strain yielded a data base of 240 genes preferentially expressed in this lineage compared with all of the other mucosal lineages (11Mills J.C. Syder A.J. Hong C.V. Guruge J.L. Raaii F. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13687-13692Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Thirty-five percent of these genes encode proteins involved in various aspects of energy metabolism, a finding consistent with the fact that the proton pumps of PCs require high energy-generating capacity. PCs are also enriched in mRNAs encoding free radical scavengers that protect against potential damage from high rates of oxidative phosphorylation, proteins involved in various aspects of lipid metabolism (PCs maintain an elaborate tubulovesicular apparatus), and components of calcium signaling pathways (e.g. those involving calcineurin) (11Mills J.C. Syder A.J. Hong C.V. Guruge J.L. Raaii F. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13687-13692Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In another study, we generated a data base of 147 transcripts enriched in GEPs using an approach that did not physically disrupt the isthmal stem cell niche (12Mills J.C. Andersson N. Hong C.V. Stappenbeck T.S. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14819-14824Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). A substantial fraction of the transcripts encode products required for processing and cytoplasmic localization of mRNAs, including homologs of Drosophila genes needed for axis formation during oogenesis. These mRNA-targeting proteins may help gut epithelial progenitors establish differential communications with their neighbors (12Mills J.C. Andersson N. Hong C.V. Stappenbeck T.S. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14819-14824Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 13Stappenbeck T.S. Mills J.C. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1004-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In this report, we present a molecular profile of ZCs retrieved from adult FVB/N mouse stomachs using counterflow elutriation and lectin panning. A GeneChip-derived dataset of transcripts enriched in ZCs compared with other gastric epithelial lineages was validated by real-time quantitative RT-PCR studies of laser capture-microdissected populations harvested from gastric cryosections. One finding from the analysis is that ZCs are a source of platelet-derived growth factors (Pdgf) A and B. Our previously published molecular profile of PCs (11Mills J.C. Syder A.J. Hong C.V. Guruge J.L. Raaii F. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13687-13692Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) revealed that they are a source of another angiogenic factor, vascular endothelial growth factor B (Vegfb). The results of quantitative three-dimensional imaging studies of the capillary networks that surround gastric units in the proximal and distal glandular epithelium of adult germ-free transgenic mice with an engineered ablation of their PCs and ZCs, and in their normal germ-free littermates, provide direct evidence that these lineages contribute to the regulation of angiogenesis. Animals—Conventionally raised, specified pathogen-free normal FVB/N mice were maintained under a strict 12-h light cycle and fed a standard chow diet (Picolab rodent diet 20, Purina Mills). Members of a pedigree of germ-free FVB/N transgenic mice that express an attenuated diphtheria toxin A fragment (tox176) under the control of nucleotides from -1035 to +24 of the mouse gene encoding the β-subunit of H+/K+-ATPase (14Syder A.J. Oh J.D. Guruge J.L. O'Donnell D. Karlsson M. Mills J.C. Bjorkholm B.M. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Stappenbeck T.S. Wong M.H. Gordon J.I. Sansonetti P. Methods in Microbiology. Vol. 31. Academic Press, London2002: 559-589Google Scholar). All experiments involving mice were conducted using protocols approved by the Animal Studies Committee of Washington University. Isolation of ZCs by Elutriation and Lectin Panning—For each cell preparation, 10 conventionally raised mice were sacrificed at 8 weeks of age. Their stomachs were rapidly removed and placed in sterile 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. Ligatures were positioned at the junction between the esophagus and forestomach and at the pylorus. A 2-mm incision was made in the forestomach, and the entire stomach was everted through the incision. Another ligature was placed at the junction between the forestomach and corpus, and 500 μl of a solution of 1.0 mg/ml Streptomyces griseus Pronase E (7 units/mg, Roche Applied Science) in medium A (70 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 50 mm HEPES, 1 mm Na2HPO4, 0.5 mm NaH2PO4, 20 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm EDTA, 11 mm glucose, 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.8) was instilled with a 27-gauge needle. Filled gastric sacs were placed in a flask containing 75 ml of medium A and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C (16Andersson N. Rhedin M. Peteri-Brunback B. Andersson K. Cabero J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1451: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 17Prinz C. Kajimura M. Scott D.R. Mercier F. Helander H.F. Sachs G.

The everted sac was then put into 75 ml of medium B (medium A with 100 mm CaCl2, 15 mm MgCl2 and no EDTA, pH 7.4) and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with constant gentle magnetic stirring. The medium, containing shed epithelial cells, was decanted and passed though a nylon mesh (60-μm-pore diameter, Millipore). Cells in the flow-through were recovered by centrifugation (150 × g, 5 min, 23 °C) and re-suspended in 5 ml of medium C (140 mm NaCl, 12 mm MgSO4, 10 mm CaCl2, 15 mm HEPES, 11 mm glucose, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4). Cellular viability was defined by staining an aliquot with a solution containing 0.1% Neutral Red, 0.1% Brilliant Cresyl Blue, and 0.01% Janus Green in PBS. Cellular concentration was adjusted to 1.5 × 107/ml medium C, and 5 × 107 cells were subjected to counterflow elutriation (JE-6 elutriator rotor with standard chamber (Beckman Instruments), injection flow rate 10 ml/min medium C containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). Details of the elutriation protocol are provided in Supplemental Table 1. Fractions 1-5 (Supplemental Table 1) were each subjected to Dolichos biflorus agglutinin (DBA)-streptavidin-conjugated magnetic bead panning (11Mills J.C. Syder A.J. Hong C.V. Guruge J.L. Raaii F. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13687-13692Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) to recover PCs (PCs are the only gastric epithelial lineage in FVB/N mice that express GalNAcα(1-3)Gal-containing glycans, see Ref.18Falk P. Roth K.A. Gordon J.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: G987-G1003Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lectin-panned cells from fractions 2-5(“PC+ population”) were pooled, and their viability and purity were defined with the vital dye mixture described above (Supplemental Tables 1 and 2) and by transmission EM. Cells in fractions 4 and 5 that remained after DBA panning (Supplemental Table 2) were pooled to generate a “ZC+” fraction. The purified ZC+ population, the purified PC+ population, and the cells in fractions 1-2 remaining after DBA panning (ZC-/PC- population) were each collected by centrifugation (150 × g, 5 min, 23 °C), re-suspended in RLT lysis buffer (Qiagen), and RNA was extracted (RNeasy mini kit with on-column DNase treatment, Qiagen). GeneChip Analysis—Equal amounts of ZC+, PC+, or ZC-/PC- RNA from each preparation (n = 6 preparations) were pooled (5 μg/cell population/preparation). Equal-sized aliquots of each RNA pool (9 μg) were used to generate biotinylated cRNA targets (11Mills J.C. Syder A.J. Hong C.V. Guruge J.L. Raaii F. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13687-13692Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 19Lee C.K. Weindruch R. Prolla T.A. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 294-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). Each cRNA target, in turn, was used to interrogate a set of Mu11K GeneChips (Affymetrix) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Data from each chip were scaled to an average target intensity of 150. A series of pairwise comparisons were performed (Fig. 2A) using proprietary GeneChip software (version 4.0). Real-time Quantitative (q)RT-PCR—Selected findings from the GeneChip study were independently validated by qRT-PCR analysis of the same RNAs employed for generating cRNA targets. Each 25-μl qRT-PCR reaction mixture contained cDNA (20Stappenbeck T.S. Hooper L.V. Manchester J.K. Wong M.H. Gordon J.I. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 356: 168-196Google Scholar), 12.5 μl of 2× SYBR Green master mixture (Applied Biosystems), 900 nm of gene-specific primers (Supplemental Table 3), and 0.25 units of UDP-N-glycosidase (Invitrogen). A melting curve (15Hooper L.V. Mills J.C. Roth K.A. Stappenbeck T.S. Wong M.H. Gordon J.I. Sansonetti P. Methods in Microbiology. Vol. 31.

Methods Enzymol. 2002; 356: 168-196Google Scholar) was used to define a temperature where the amplicon and not primer-dimers was the source of SYBR Green-bound fluorescence. All assays were performed in triplicate with an ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detector (Applied Biosystems). Data were normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA (ΔΔCT method). Navigated Laser Capture Microdissection (n-LCM)—Stomachs from conventionally raised 8-week-old mice (n = 5) were divided in half along their lesser and greater curvatures and rinsed quickly in PBS. Each half was imbedded in O.C.T. compound (Sakura Finetek, Torrance, CA) and frozen in Cytocool II (Richard-Allen Scientific, Kalamazoo, MI). Serial 7 μm-thick cryosections were cut, placed on Superfrost/Plus slides (Fisher Scientific), and stained with methyl green/eosin Y (20Stappenbeck T.S. Hooper L.V. Manchester J.K. Wong M.H. Gordon J.I. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 356: 168-196Google Scholar). Well oriented gastric units (i.e. having an uninterrupted epithelial column that extended from the base to the apex of the pit), located in the corpus region of the stomach, were subjected to n-LCM (PixCell II apparatus, 7.5-μm spot diameter; CapSure HS LCM caps, Arcturus, Mountain View, CA) as described under “Results.” Epithelial cells were recovered from three different areas: the lowest ∼25% (base of the gastric unit consisting mainly of ZCs); the top ∼25% (pit, predominantly pit cells); and the mesenchyme immediately below the gastric unit (n = 300 gastric units microdissected/cryosection, 4-5 cryosections sections/mouse). RNA was isolated from ∼5000 cells/fraction/mouse using the PicoPure RNA isolation kit (Arcturus) with on-column DNase treatment. Equal amounts of RNA from each area were pooled from three mice and the material used for qRT-PCR studies. Transmission EM—Cells recovered by elutriation/lectin panning were subjected to transmission EM analysis using protocols described in a previous publication (11Mills J.C. Syder A.J. Hong C.V. Guruge J.L. Raaii F. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13687-13692Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Three-dimensional Imaging Studies of the Gastric Microvasculature—8-week-old germ-free normal and tox176 mice were anesthetized, and 200 μl of a 20 mg/ml aqueous solution of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled high molecular mass (2000 kDa) dextran (Sigma) was injected in their retro-orbital plexus using a 30-gauge needle attached to a 1-ml syringe. Three minutes after the 10-15-s infusion, animals were sacrificed and their stomachs were removed and perfused with fixation solution (0.5% paraformaldehyde, 15% picric acid, 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0). Each stomach was opened with an incision along its greater curvature, pinned on wax, and shaken at 4 °C for 12 h in fixation solution. Following three washes in ice-cold PBS (5 min/cycle), the stomach was incubated for 3 h in 10% sucrose/PBS (4 °C) and then overnight in 20% sucrose, 10% glycerol/PBS (4 °C). After freezing the tissue in O.C.T., 60 μm-thick cryosections were cut along the cephalocaudal axis. Sections were air-dried (2 h at room temperature in the dark), re-hydrated in ice-cold PBS (1 min), incubated overnight (4 °C) in 3% deoxycholic acid (Sigma), rinsed with deionized water (2 cycles, 5 min each, room temperature) followed by a PBS wash (5 min, room temperature), and stained with either Syto61 (1:1000 dilution in PBS, 1 h at room temperature, Molecular Probes) or FITC-DBA. Following three more PBS washes (5 min/cycle, room temperature), sections were mounted in 50% glycerol/PBS, viewed under a LSM 510 confocal microscope (Zeiss), and scanned at 3-μm-thick intervals. Scans were projected in three dimensions by taking 20 serial images, aligning them at 7-10° intervals, and then compiling/rotating them around the y axis using LSM 510 software. Purification of Zymogenic Cells from Adult FVB/N Mouse Stomachs—ZCs were purified from the stomachs of conventionally raised 8-week-old mice belonging to the FVB/N inbred strain. Mucosa from the corpus region of the stomach was dissociated by Pronase E digestion, and the cellular suspension was size-fractionated by counterflow elutriation. Five fractions were recovered, and each fraction was subjected to lectin panning with DBA-magnetic bead conjugates to remove parietal cells. This approach yielded two fractions enriched for ZCs (fractions 4 and 5 in Supplemental Tables 1 and 2). Histochemical and immunohistochemical analyses using a previously described panel of lineage-specific lectins and antibodies (11Mills J.C. Syder A.J. Hong C.V. Guruge J.L. Raaii F. Gordon J.I. Proc.

Overall cell viability in the two fractions, which together composed the ZC+ population, was >90% as defined by vital dye exclusion (Supplemental Table 1). Transmission EM studies confirmed that the purified ZCs had retained the characteristic morphologic features of mature members of this lineage (Fig. 2B). A PC+ population obtained by combining the cells from fractions 2-5 that bound DBA contained 84 ± 1% PCs versus 21 ± 2% in the starting material (Supplemental Table 2 and Fig. 2C) with an overall viability of 91 ± 3% (n = 6 preparations). A third population was obtained by pooling DBA non-reactive cells from the two elutriated fractions that contained the smallest average cell size (fractions 1-2 in Supplemental Tables 1 and 2). This ZC-/PC- fraction contained an average of 50% pit cells, 20% neck cells, <1% PCs, <2% ZCs, and 27% of other cell types (GEPs, enteroendocrine cells, and mesenchymal components) (Supplemental Table 2 and Fig. 2D). GeneChip-based Dataset of Transcripts Enriched in Zymogenic Cells—Total cellular RNA was extracted from the ZC+, PC+, and ZC-/PC- populations obtained from each of the six preparations. Equivalent amounts of RNA from a given population/preparation were pooled. Two cRNA targets were then independently prepared from each pooled RNA sample (ZC+, PC+, or ZC-/PC-), and each cRNA was used to interrogate Affymetrix Mu11K GeneChips containing probe sets that recognize ∼11,000 mouse genes and ESTs. Duplicate comparisons of ZC+ versus PC+ RNAs yielded a dataset of 187 transcripts (156 encoding characterized proteins, 31 encoding unknown or hypothetical proteins) enriched in the ZC+ population (Supplemental Table 4). Duplicate comparisons of ZC+ versus ZC-/PC- RNAs identified 124 ZC+-enriched transcripts (95 encoding characterized proteins, 29 specifying unknown/hypothetical proteins, Supplemental Table 5). The union of these two datasets (Fig. 2A) produced a list of 57 known genes and 14 uncharacterized genes from what amounted to quadruplicate comparisons (Supplemental Table 6). A reciprocal analysis of PC+ versus ZC+ and PC+ versus ZC-/PC- datasets identified 83 transcripts enriched in PCs (data not shown). This list shared 93% identity (77 of 83 mRNAs) with our previously published datasets of transcripts enriched in PCs harvested by direct lectin panning (i.e. without an elutriation step, see Ref. 11Mills J.C. Syder A.J. Hong C.V. Guruge J.L. Raaii F. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13687-13692Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The similarity between the current and previous PC+ datasets indicated that the elutriation protocol used in the present study did not artifactually skew the transcriptional profiles of sorted cells. Verification of the Dataset—12 genes were culled from the ZC+ dataset for initial real-time qRT-PCR confirmation of their enriched expression in ZCs. Assays were performed on the same RNAs used to generate cRNA targets for the GeneChip study. 7 of the 12 genes were known to be expressed in ZCs: Pepf (pepsinogen F, see Ref. 22Blandizzi C.

Carboxylase has ten cysteine residues, but their form (sulfhydryl or disulfide) is largely unknown. Pudota et al. in Pudota, B. N., Miyagi, M., Hallgren, K. W., West, K. A., Crabb, J. W., Misono, K. S., and Berkner, K. L. (2000) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 97, 13033–13038 reported that Cys-99 and Cys-450 are the carboxylase active site residues. We determined the form of all cysteines in carboxylase using in-gel protease digestion and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry. The spectrum of non-reduced, trypsin-digested carboxylase revealed a peak at m/z 1991.9. Only this peak disappeared in the spectrum of the reduced sample. This peak's m/z is consistent with the mass of peptide 92–100 (Cys-99) disulfide-linked with peptide 446–453 (Cys-450). To confirm its identity, the m/z 1991.9 peak was isolated by a timed ion selector as the precursor ion for further MS analysis. The fragmentation pattern exhibited two groups of triplet ions characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric cleavage of disulfide-linked tryptic peptides containing Cys-99 and Cys-450. Mutation of either Cys-99 or Cys-450 caused loss of enzymatic activity. We created a carboxylase variant with both C598A and C700A, leaving Cys-450 as the only remaining cysteine residue in the 60-kDa fragment created by limited trypsin digestion. Analysis of this fully active mutant enzyme showed a 30- and the 60-kDa fragment were joined under non-reducing conditions, thus confirming Cys-450 participates in a disulfide bond. Our results indicate that Cys-99 and Cys-450 form the only disulfide bond in carboxylase.

The carboxylation reaction occurs in the lumen of the ER (3Bristol J.A. Ratcliffe J.V. Roth D.A. Jacobs M.A. Furie B.C. Furie B. Blood. 1996; 88: 2585-2593Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Carlisle T.L. Suttie J.W. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 1161-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and uses the substrates carbon dioxide, oxygen, and vitamin K hydroquinone. During the process of carboxylation, the γ-proton of the glutamic acid is abstracted, followed by the addition of carbon dioxide (5Vermeer C. Biochem. J. 1990; 266: 625-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Simultaneous with carboxylation, the vitamin K hydroquinone is converted to vitamin K epoxide, which is converted back to vitamin K by the enzyme epoxide reductase. The formation of vitamin K epoxide has sometimes been called an epoxidation reaction. Gla modification is critical for the function of more than a dozen proteins involved in blood coagulation and calcium homeostasis (6Furie B. Bouchard B.A. Furie B.C. Blood. 1999; 93: 1798-1808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Berkner K.L. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 1877-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The importance of vitamin K-dependent proteins may be even greater than previously thought, as evidenced by the discovery of growth-arrest protein gas-6 (8Manfioletti G. Brancolini C. Avanzi G. Schneider C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4976-4985Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar), and the very recent identification of four putative vitamin K-dependent membrane Gla proteins PRGP1, PRGP2, TMG3, and TMG4 (9Kulman J.D.

U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1370-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). There are ten cysteine residues in the human carboxylase molecule. Our work on the topology of the carboxylase predicts that of these ten cysteines, two are located in the cytoplasm, three are buried in the ER membrane, and five are found in the lumen of the ER (11Tie J. Wu S.M. Jin D. Nicchitta C.V. Stafford D.W. Blood. 2000; 96: 973-978Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sulfhydryl groups and disulfide bonds are important for both the structure and function of proteins (12Giles N.M. Giles G.I. Jacob C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 300: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 13Hiniker A. Bardwell J.C. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1179-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 14Wedemeyer W.J. Welker E.

For example, the natural abundance of cysteine is 1.2%, but these residues constitute 5.6% of enzyme catalytic sites (16Bartlett G.J. Porter C.T. Borkakoti N. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 105-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Therefore, identification of free cysteine residues or those involved in disulfide bond formation can give valuable information about the structure and function of proteins. Several studies have implicated cysteine in the function of carboxylase. Chemical modification of carboxylase by sulfhydryl-reactive reagents suggests that cysteine residues are important for the carboxylation reaction (17Morris D.P. Soute B.A. Vermeer C. Stafford D.W. J.

Science. 1995; 269: 1684-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) developed a “base strength amplification mechanism” for carboxylation. They proposed that two free cysteines are involved in the active site of carboxylase. Recently, Pudota et al. (21Pudota B.N. Miyagi M. Hallgren K.W. West K.A. Crabb J.W. Misono K.S. Berkner K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13033-13038Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) analyzed the catalytically important cysteine residues of the carboxylase by modifying free cysteines with the radiolabeled sulfhydryl-reactive reagent 14C-NEM. These authors reported that cysteine residues 99 and 450 are the active site residues of carboxylase (21Pudota B.N. Miyagi M. Hallgren K.W. West K.A. Crabb J.W. Misono K.S. Berkner K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13033-13038Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In contrast to the multiple studies on the importance of free cysteines in carboxylase, the only information about disulfide bridges in the structure of the carboxylase is the study by Wu et al. (23Wu S.M. Mutucumarana V.P. Geromanos S. Stafford D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11718-11722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This study demonstrated that limited trypsin digestion of carboxylase at residues 349 and 351 results in a 30 kDa amino-terminal fragment disulfide linked to a 60 kDa carboxyl-terminal fragment. Although mass spectrometry has been used to characterize soluble proteins, its application to integral membrane proteins has lagged because of their unique characteristics (24Santoni V. Molloy M. Rabilloud T. Electrophoresis. 2000; 21: 1054-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar, 25Wu C.C. Yates J.R. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Integral membrane proteins represent around 30% of all proteins and play important roles in various cellular processes including signal transduction, cell adhesion, ion transport, endocytosis, and many enzymatic reactions (26Stevens T.J. Arkin I.T. Proteins. 2000; 39: 417-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 27Wallin E. von Heijne G. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1029-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar). The hydrophobic nature of the integral membrane proteins requires the use of detergents for solubilization and stability (28Garavito R.M. Ferguson-Miller S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32403-32406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar), but most detergents are not compatible with mass spectrometric analysis. Therefore, new approaches for the application of mass spectrometry to characterize and identify membrane proteins are being actively pursued (25Wu C.C. Yates J.R. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 29Wu C.C. MacCoss M.J. Howell K.E. Yates J.R. Nat.

Mass Spectr. 2002; 37: 322-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Among recent studies, van Montfort et al. (30van Montfort B.A. Canas B. Duurkens R. Godovac-Zimmermann J. Robillard G.T. J. Mass Spectr. 2002; 37: 322-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) reported an improved in-gel approach to generate peptide maps of integral membrane proteins for MALDI-MS. In this study, we have used in-gel protease digestion and MALDI-TOF MS/MS to identify the disulfide linkage of the human vitamin K-dependent carboxylase. Our results indicate that a disulfide bond joins cysteine residues 99 and 450. Mutation of either of these two cysteines significantly decreases the carboxylase activity. This is expected if the structure of the enzyme is compromised by the lack of the disulfide bond. Materials—All chemicals were reagent grade. CHAPS, n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside, α-cyano-4-hydroxysuccinnamic acid, and N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). 1,2-Dioleoylsn-Glycero-3-Phosphocholine (PC) was from Avanti (Alabaster, AL). H-d-Phe-Pro-Arg-chloromethylketone and FLEEL were from Bachem (King of Prussia, PA). NaH14CO3 (specific activity, 54 mCi/mmol) was from ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Costa Mesa, CA). Tris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) hydrochloride was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Vitamin K1 was from Abbott Laboratories (Chicago, IL). PNGase F (500,000 units/ml) and all the restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Aprotinin and sequencing grade modified trypsin and chymotrypsin were from Roche (Indianapolis, IN). The BacVector-3000 kit for insect cell transfection was from Novagen (Madison, WI). Coomassie Blue R-250, protein standard markers, and SDS-PAGE ready gel were from Bio-Rad. SP-Sepharose was from Amersham Biosciences, and anti-HPC4 resin was kindly provided by Dr. Charles Esmon (Cardiovascular Biology Research Program, Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, Oklahoma City, OK). Site-directed Mutagenesis—Oligonucleotides and PCR primers used for site-directed mutagenesis were synthesized by Invitrogen Life Technologies (Frederick, MD). Site-directed cysteine mutagenesis of human carboxylase was conducted by the “Megaprimer” method of PCR mutagenesis (31Sarkar G. Sommer S.S. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407PubMed Google Scholar, 32Datta A.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4530-4531Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Wild-type human carboxylase cDNA with a FLAG tag (DYKDDDDK) at the amino terminus and a HPC4 tag (EDQVDPRLIDGK) at the carboxyl terminus (33Stearns D.J. Kurosawa S. Sims P.J. Esmon N.L. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 826-832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used as template DNA for the PCR. Mutations were screened by restriction digestion, verified by sequencing the entire cDNA of the carboxylase and subcloned to the expression vector pVL1392. Expression and Purification of Human Carboxylase in Insect Cells— Wild-type or cysteine mutant carboxylase cDNA engineered in the expression vector was co-transfected with BacVector 3000 triple-cut virus DNA into Sf9 cells. The recombinant virus was isolated by plaque purification, amplified, and screened by carboxylase activity assay of the cell lysate. Expression of carboxylase was done by infection of ∼2 × 106/ml High Five cells with the recombinant virus at a mutiplicity of infection of ∼1. Cells were collected after 48 h of infection, and the expressed carboxylase was purified by affinity chromatography using anti-HPC4 antibody-coupled Sepharose resin as described (34Stanley T.B. Jin D.Y. Lin P.J. Stafford D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16940-16944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Further concentration of the protein was accomplished by binding the affinity-purified enzyme to SP-Sepharose in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% PC, 0.3% CHAPS, and 15% glycerol, followed by step elution with 500 mm NaCl in the same buffer. The reducing reagent dithiothreitol was excluded from all purification steps. Because our results on the activity of carboxylase with point mutations C343S and C288S differ from those of Pudota et al. (21Pudota B.N. Miyagi M. Hallgren K.W. West K.A. Crabb J.W. Misono K.S. Berkner K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13033-13038Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 35Pudota B.N. Hommema E.L. Hallgren K.W. McNally B.A. Lee S. Berkner K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46878-46886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), we isolated the virus DNA from which these mutant proteins were prepared and the entire cDNA sequence was again confirmed. Carboxylase Activity Assays—The carboxylase activity assay was performed in a total volume of 125 μl containing 25 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 0.8 m (NH4)2SO4, 0.12% PC, 0.28% CHAPS, 4 μm proFIX, 5 μCi of NaH14CO3 (specific activity, 54 mCi/mmol), 222 μm vitamin K hydroquinone, and 1.25 mm FLEEL. The reaction was started by the addition of 10 μl of an ice-cold mix of NaH14CO3 and vitamin K hydroquinone; the reaction mix was immediately transferred to a 20 °C water bath and incubated for 30 min. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 1 ml of 5% trichloroacetic acid, and the amount of 14CO2 incorporated into the small substrate FLEEL was determined, as previously described (34Stanley T.B. Jin D.Y. Lin P.J. Stafford D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16940-16944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Deglycosylation and NEM Modification of the Carboxylase—Glycoproteins often yield poor peptide maps for mass analysis because the oligosaccharides can effectively shield proteolytic cleavage sites (36Rudd P.M. Joao H.C. Coghill E. Fiten P. Saunders M.R. Opdenakker G. Dwek R.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Therefore, freshly purified carboxylase was deglycosylated before being subjected to protease digestion by adding 100 μl of Buffer G7 (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5 at 25 °C) and 10 μl of PNGase F (500 units/μl) to a 900-μl carboxylase sample. Three hours at 37 °C was sufficient for deglycosylation of denatured carboxylase; however, 16 h at 18 °C was required for deglycosylation of native carboxylase. The efficiency of deglycosylation was evaluated by SDS-PAGE. NEM modification of carboxylase was performed at room temperature, as described by Pudota et al. (21Pudota B.N. Miyagi M. Hallgren K.W. West K.A. Crabb J.W. Misono K.S. Berkner K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13033-13038Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), except, instead of quenching the reaction by dithiothreitol, it was loaded directly onto non-reducing SDS-PAGE and the NEM used in our experiments was not radioactively labeled. In-gel Protease Digestion—Carboxylase samples were loaded onto 10% SDS-PAGE gels in the absence of reducing reagent. After separation, the gel was fixed with 25% isopropyl alcohol/10% acetic acid for 20 min and stained with 0.01% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250 in 10% acetic acid for 1 h. It was destained with 10% acetic acid, the protein band excised, and the gel pieces treated as described (30van Montfort B.A. Canas B. Duurkens R. Godovac-Zimmermann J. Robillard G.T. J. Mass Spectr. 2002; 37: 322-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The gel pieces were completely destained with 50 mm NH4HCO3 in 40% ethanol, and then washed with 1000 μl of 25 mm NH4HCO3 three times for 15 min and cut into pieces of <1 mm3. Subsequently, the gel pieces were dehydrated with 1000 μl of acetonitrile three times for 10 min and completely dried with a SpeedVac. Protease digestion was started by the addition of sufficient 100 ng/μl sequencing grade-modified trypsin or chymotrypsin in 25 mm NH4HCO3 buffer to immerse the dried gel pieces. After re-hydration, the gel pieces were covered with an overlay of 20 μl of 25 mm NH4HCO3 buffer so that they remained immersed throughout the digestion. The protein was digested overnight by trypsin at 30 °C without agitation. Digestion reaction supernatants were directly pooled for MALDI-TOF mass spectrum. After collecting the supernatant, the digested gel pieces were extracted three times by sonication for 5 min in 60% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and 0.1% n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside. These extracts were combined and dried in a SpeedVac. The dried sample was dissolved in 5 μl of 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, sonicated for 2 min, and used for recording the MALDI-TOF mass spectrum. Chymotrypsin digestion was as above, with the exception that digestion was performed for 5 h and the reaction was stopped by adding trifluoroacetic acid to a final concentration of 5%. Reaction supernatant and extracts were combined and concentrated to ∼20 μl by SpeedVac. The pH was adjusted by NH4HCO3 if needed. Reduced samples were prepared by adding freshly prepared TCEP to a final concentration of 2 mm to the non-reduced samples. MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry—0.3 μl of the above sample and 0.3 μl of 10 mg/ml 1-cyano-4-hydroxysuccinnamic acid in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v) were deposited on the target plate and air-dried. MALDI mass spectra were recorded with an ABI 4700 Proteomics Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometer. A frequency-tripled Nd:YAG laser ionized samples at a pulse frequency of 200 Hz with its power adjusted between 15 and 30 μJ, depending on the sample. Laboratory air was used as the collision gas and the collision cell vacuum pressure was 7–9 × 10–7 Torr. MALDI-TOF data from tryptic digests were calibrated with auto-proteolytic peaks (internal standards) and mass errors were less than 20 ppm. The mass range for TOF MS scan functions was set to m/z 500 to 4000. TOF MS/MS scan functions were calibrated externally against the fragments of either angiotensin I or adrenocorticotropic hormone fragment 18–39 depending upon the precursor mass. The mass accuracy of CID data was typically better than 50 ppm. Limited Trypsinization of Carboxylase—Limited trypsin digestions of carboxylase in the presence of propeptide were performed as previously described (23Wu S.M. Mutucumarana V.P. Geromanos S. Stafford D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11718-11722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A pilot reaction was run for each batch of trypsin and carboxylase to determine the optimal conditions for limited cleavage. Cleavage was accomplished on ice in the presence of 5 μm proFIX. Trypsin cleavage was stopped by the addition of H-d-Phe-Pro-Arg chloromethylketone and Aprotinin to a final concentration of 1.6 μm. Samples were subjected to a reducing and non-reducing gradient (4–20%) SDS-PAGE, and the protein bands were made visible through silver staining. Peptide Mass Fingerprint of Human Vitamin K-dependent Carboxylase by MALDI-TOF MS—Freshly purified carboxylase (37Presnell S.R. Tripathy A. Lentz B.R. Jin D.Y. Stafford D.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11723-11733Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) was deglycosylated, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and digested in-gel (30van Montfort B.A. Canas B. Duurkens R. Godovac-Zimmermann J. Robillard G.T. J. Mass Spectr. 2002; 37: 322-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows a typical MALDI-TOF mass spectrum of the trypsin-digested non-reduced carboxylase. The MS-Fit search program (38Clauser K.R. Baker P. Burlingame A.L. Anal. Chem. 1999; 71: 2871-2882Crossref PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar), a part of “Protein Prospector” Version 4.0.4 (available at prospector.ucsf.edu), was used to identify the mass peaks in the “NCBInr.5.28.2003” data base. The results of the search are shown in Table I. Cysteine-containing peptides are marked by an asterisk in Fig. 1. A diagram of the sequence coverage of carboxylase by MALDI-TOF MS is shown in Fig. 2. For trypsin digestion, 38.8% of the expected peptides were recovered; this coverage could be increased to 41.9% by re-extraction of the gel pieces after the supernatant had been removed.Table IAssignment of fragment ions obtained from MALDI-TOF MS of the in-gel trypsin digestion of human vitamin K-dependent γ-glutamyl carboxylaseResiduesMeasured massExpected massm/zm/z407-412735.3536735.390284-90747.3871747.4001666-671787.4305787.4314674-680900.4328900.4328—1-9906.4529906.4467446-453aCysteine-containing peptides.941.4496941.4515327-334952.6205952.6195319-326aCysteine-containing peptides.965.4939965.4879319-326aCysteine-containing peptides.,bAcrylamide modified cysteine residue containing peptide.1036.52761036.525092-100aCysteine-containing peptides.1053.50461053.5039673-6801056.54611056.5339235-2421061.55371061.557320-291085.60001085.595592-100aCysteine-containing peptides.,bAcrylamide modified cysteine residue containing peptide.1124.55021124.5410437-445cPeptides recovered from the gel extract.1143.54221143.5621579-5881173.58361173.5727335-346aCysteine-containing peptides.1249.61671249.6251648-6611511.82301511.8222486-4981516.79981516.7912192-2041552.84671552.838937-491609.80481609.8015420-4351738.87841738.876469-83cPeptides recovered from the gel extract.1824.97421824.9722499-5131828.95611828.9420219-2341933.87371933.864251-681983.14031983.1391218-2342061.95922061.9592689-704aCysteine-containing peptides.,bAcrylamide modified cysteine residue containing peptide.2076.08302076.1251458-476dGlycosylated peptides.2373.19782372.1563625-647dGlycosylated peptides.2433.29032432.2561623-647dGlycosylated peptides.2690.42702689.3936a Cysteine-containing peptides.b Acrylamide modified cysteine residue containing peptide.c Peptides recovered from the gel extract.d Glycosylated peptides.

Nicchitta C.V. Stafford D.W. Blood. 2000; 96: 973-978Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence coverage for tryptic digestion is 41.9%. Chymotryptic sequence coverage is 30.5%. The combined sequence coverage is 62.3%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) There are three peptide peaks (Table I) at m/z 2373.2, 2433.3, and 2690.4 corresponding to residues 458–476, 625–647, and 623–647 that differ by 1 unit from the expected trypsin-digested fragments. Each of these peptides has a consensus sequence for N-glycosylation. Because deglycosylation by PNGase F converts an asparagine residue to an aspartic acid residue, the 1-unit mass shift is expected. This prediction was confirmed by MS/MS sequencing of the tryptic peptides and deglycosylation of carboxylase in the presence of 18O-labeled water (data not shown). To increase the sequence coverage, limited chymotrypsin digestion of carboxylase was performed. Chymotrypsin digestion alone covers 30.5% of the carboxylase sequence, some of which overlaps with the sequence recovered by trypsin digestion (Fig. 2). Total sequence coverage with trypsin and chymotrypsin was 62.3% of the entire carboxylase. Higher sequence coverage is difficult to obtain because the hydrophobic peptide region and the membrane-spanning segments are either not readily accessible to proteolytic enzymes, and/or are difficult to extract from the gel pieces. As shown in Fig. 2, peptides containing all of the ten cysteines were recovered. Disulfide-linked Peptides of the Carboxylase Molecule—The program MS-Fit in Protein Prospector was used to search for possible disulfide-linked peptides in both the trypsin and chymotrypsin digestions of the non-reduced carboxylase samples. The candidate peaks were then compared with the peptides from a MALDI-TOF mass spectrum of the reduced sample. A peptide ion of m/z at 1991.9 (Fig. 3A) from the trypsin-digested non-reduced sample matches the expected size of a peptide consisting of residues 92–100 (m/z at 1053.5) disulfide-linked to residues 446–453 (m/z at 941.4). As would be expected if this peak represented a disulfide-linked peptide, it was not present in the spectrum of the reduced sample (Fig. 3B). This is the only candidate disulfide-linked peptide that disappears in the reduced sample. Therefore, it appears to be the only disulfide bond in the carboxylase because peptides containing all of the ten cysteines were identified (Fig. 2). Small signals of the reduced forms of peptides 92–100 (m/z at 1053.5) and 446–453 (m/z at 941.4) were also observed in the non-reduced trypsin-digested carboxylase sample (Table I). This is the result of MALDI-induced cleavage of the disulfide bond, as observed by other groups (39Patterson S.D. Katta V. Anal.

MS/MS Analysis of Peptide m/z at 1991.9 —We isolated the peptide consisting of residues 92–100 disulfide-linked to residues 446–453 at m/z 1991.9 by a timed ion selector as the precursor ion for further MS analysis (Fig. 4)."

Irvine R.F. Nature. 1989; 341: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (3288) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in non-mammalian cells, namely Dictyostelium, evidence has been presented that the abundant higher inositol polyphosphates, particularly Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 can also be degraded to Ins(1,4,5)P3 (7Van Dijken P. de Haas J.R.

Viggars J. Harwood A.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2734-2745Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), thus separating Ins(1,4,5)P3 production from PIP2 breakdown and the diacylglycerol-mediated activation of protein kinase C. However, these studies did not report whether the Ins(1,4,5)P3 so produced could impact intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis. In intact mammalian cells no such pathway has been reported; however, in vitro multiple inositol polyphosphate phosphatase (MIPP) has been shown to possess the enzymatic activity to convert Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 to Ins(1,4,5)P3 via inositol tetrakisphosphate intermediates (7Van Dijken P. de Haas J.R.

The role of this pathway in an intact cell is rather problematic because of the fact that the majority of the MIPP is confined in the ER (9Ali N. Craxton A. Shears S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6161-6167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Craxton A. Caffrey J.J. Burkhart W. Safrany S.T. Shears S.B. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and thus removed from Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5, which exists largely in the cytosol (11Stuart J.A. Anderson K.L. French P.J. Kirk C.J. Michell R.H. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 517-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). There are, however, exceptions to this generalization as membrane-associated MIPP activity in human erythrocytes is exposed to the cytosol (12Estrada-Garcia T. Craxton A. Kirk C.J. Michell R.H. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1991; 244: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). However, in general, the limited access of MIPP to its substrates restricts its use as a tool to study the impact of higher inositol polyphosphate-generated Ins(1,4,5)P3 on [Ca2+]i. In contrast, we reasoned that a cytosolic version of this enzyme (cyt-MIPP) may be a such a tool, allowing us to separate the production of Ins(1,4,5)P3 from the concomitant breakdown of lipids. To best judge the impact of cyt-MIPP expression we used a β-cell line with an abnormally low basal intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), reasoning that this system would represent the most sensitive assay for recording a possible impact of cyt-MIPP on [Ca2+]i homeostasis. We now report for the first time that cyt-MIPP expression can generate Ins(1,4,5)P3 in an intact cell. Furthermore, it significantly impacts on cellular Ca2+ homeostasis by both raising the low basal [Ca2+]i in our model cell line to more normal levels and, as a likely consequence, considerably enhancing a previously poor Ca2+ response to glucose. This enhanced response was mediated by several interlinked factors. These included the sensitizing of the ryanodine receptor (RYR) to Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) and the subsequent enhancement of Ca2+ entry, predominantly through store-operated Ca2+ channels. These data suggest that cyt-MIPP will be a useful tool in the investigation of Ins(1,4,5)P3 in intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis, as evidenced by 1) data suggesting a link between basal Ins(1,4,5)P3 concentration and basal [Ca2+]i and 2) the importance of this basal [Ca2+]i in determining the responsiveness of the RYR. Moreover, it should be noted that the full-length form of MIPP has unrestricted access to the cytosol in some mammalian cells (12Estrada-Garcia T. Craxton A. Kirk C.J. Michell R.H. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1991; 244: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Hence, the pathway discussed here may have an impact on cellular Ca2+ handling in general. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Labeling Protocols—HIT M2.2.2. cells were routinely maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) as described previously (13Leibiger I.B. Walther R. Pett U. Leibiger B. FEBS Lett. 1994; 337: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). For experiments a modified RPMI 1640, 1640-M, was used. This modified medium contained additional MgSO4 (to give a final concentration of 0.8 mm) and 50 μm inositol (to make it more representative of the physiological milieu and to enable more efficient labeling) and 5.5 mm glucose. The 10% serum in this medium had been dialyzed (1000 molecular weight cut-off; Spectro Por) to remove inositol. HIT M2.2.2 cells were plated at about 10% of their confluent density into 35- or 92-mm dishes and allowed to grow in the above RPMI 1640-M medium for 24 h. The cells were then changed into the transfection medium, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, with the same inositol concentration as the experimental RPMI 1640-M. Cyt-MIPP expression plasmid (pCI.FLAG-MIPP) or vector alone were transfected into the cells using a Ca2+ phosphate precipitation technique (13Leibiger I.B. Walther R. Pett U. Leibiger B. FEBS Lett. 1994; 337: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The next day the cells were washed and reintroduced into the RPMI 1640-M medium and maintained for a further 24 h. For some experiments measuring inositol polyphosphates and [Ca2+]i, cells were washed twice in a Krebs buffer and preincubated for 45 min in the RPMI 1640-M medium, with a reduced glucose concentration (0.1 mm). To determine cell number and approximate volume, cells were trypsinized from the dish and counted, and the volume was estimated by measuring the diameter of spherical cells with a microscope and calibrated graticule. For the measurement of inositol phosphates cells were labeled for the entire growth period of 72 h with 6 μCi/ml myo-[3H]inositol (Amersham Biosciences) in the above medium in either 35- or 92-mm-diameter dishes. Inositol Phosphate Analysis—Inositol phosphates were extracted using previously published methodologies (14Barker C.J. Nilsson T. Kirk C.J. Michell R.H. Berggren P.O. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 15Larsson O. Barker C.J. Sjöholm A. Carlqvist H. Michell R.H. Bertorello A. Nilsson T. Honkanen R.E. Mayr G.W. Zwiller J.

J. 1995; 306: 557-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, medium was removed from the cells, and the cells were washed rapidly with Krebs-Ringer before addition of ice-cold 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. The cell debris was pelleted, and the supernatant was removed and neutralized by ether washing and the addition of 0.1 m EDTA (pH 7.0) to bring the final pH to 6.5–7.0. To determine the mass of Ins(1,4,5)P3 a commercial binding protein assay was used (Amersham Biosciences). The assay was carried out exactly as described in the supplied manual using a perchloric acid extraction protocol. Samples were then stored at –20 °C until required for HPLC. HPLC—We performed HPLC on a 25-cm Whatman Partisphere-SAX column (Laserchrom, United Kingdom). For InsP separations HPLC was carried out as described previously (16Barker C.J. French P.J. Moore A.J. Nilsson T. Berggren P.O. Bunce C.M. Kirk C.J. Michell R.H. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 557-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Initial identification of InsP species was carried out by the inclusion of [3H]inositol phosphate standards: inositol 1-phosphate, inositol 1,4-bisphosphate, inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate, Ins(1,4,5)P3, Ins(1,3,4,5)P4, and InsP6 in samples split into two. The two halves were run with and without standards. Standards were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, with the exception of inositol 1,3,4 trisphosphate, which was prepared from the Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 by dephosphorylation using human erythrocyte membranes. Other inositol phosphates were identified by their relative elution positions and comparison of a previous study (16Barker C.J. French P.J. Moore A.J. Nilsson T. Berggren P.O. Bunce C.M. Kirk C.J. Michell R.H. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 557-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) on β-cells using [14C]-labeled internal standards and identical elution conditions. Actual concentrations of InsPs were estimated based on the known volume of the cells and the known specific activity of the inositol used to label the majority of the cellular material. Radioactivity was determined by the addition of Packard Ultima Flo AP scintillant and counting on a Packard CA 2000 scintillation counter (both from CIAB, Stockholm, Sweden). Measurement of [Ca2+]i—Cells were cultured and transfected as above. They were then preincubated in basal glucose (0.1 mm) for 45 min. At the beginning of this preincubation period cells were loaded with Fura-2/AM to give a final concentration of 2 μm. Transfected cells were identified by DsRed (Molecular Probes, Leiden, Netherlands) fluorescence following coexpression with pRcCMVi.DsRed. DsRed was used rather than GFP because of the substantial interference of GFP in Fura-2 measurements, whereas DsRed has little impact. Fluorescence imaging was performed with a cool charged-coupled device camera (CH250 with KAF 1400; Photometrics, Tucson, AZ) connected to an imaging system (Inovision, Durham, NC) placed on a Zeiss Axiovert 135TV microscope (Carl Zeiss AGT, Göttingen, Germany) with a 515/40 emission filter using the Ratiotool software (Inovision). A SPEX fluorolog-2 CMlT11I spectrofluorimeter (SPEX industries, Edison, NJ) was used for fluorescence excitation at 340 and 380 nm. [Ca2+]i was expressed as the ratio of fluorescence at 340 and 380 nm. To estimate basal [Ca2+]i in the MIPP-versus mock-transfected cells, the experiments were calibrated as described previously (17Islam M.S. Kindmark H. Larsson O. Berggren P.O. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 347-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To verify that the pharmacological agents were working, we did parallel experiments on normal mouse β-cells. Thus we alternated measurements of mouse β-cell [Ca2+]i changes with those of the HIT M2.2.2 cells. Normal mouse β-cells have previously been extensively characterized and thus served as positive controls to all procedures and reagents during [Ca2+]i measurements. The responses of the normal mouse β-cells in the present study were similar to those reported previously in the literature (data not shown). Electrophysiology—HIT M2.2.2 cells were transfected with either pCI.FLAG-MIPP (cyt-MIPP) in combination with pRcCMVi.EGFP or pRcCMVi.EGFP alone as mock transfection. In this case DsRed was not needed as no Fura-2 Ca2+ measurements were carried out. The transfected cells were cultured from 2 to 4 days on coverslips. The cells expressing EGFP were selected for single channel recordings. Pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries (Hilgenberg, Malsfeld, Germany) on a horizontal programmable puller (DMZ Universal Puller; Zeitz-Instrumente, Ausburg, Germany). Typical electrode resistance was 2–4 megohms. Cell-attached single channel recordings were made with Ba2+ as the charge carrier (in mm): 110 BaCl2, 10 tetraethyl ammonium chloride, 5 HEPES-Ba(OH)2, pH 7.4. A depolarizing external recording solution, containing (in mm) 125 KCl, 30 KOH, 10 EGTA, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 5 HEPES-KOH, pH 7.15, was used to bring the intracellular potential to approx 0 mV. Recordings were made with an Axopatch 200 amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Voltage pulses (200 ms) were applied at a frequency of 0.5 Hz to depolarize cells from a holding potential of –70 mV to a membrane potential of 0 mV. Resulting currents were filtered at 1 kHz, digitized at 5 kHz, and analyzed with the software program pCLAMP 6 (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). The construct used in this study was based on the N-terminal truncated rat MIPP sequence first reported by Craxton et al. (10Craxton A. Caffrey J.J. Burkhart W. Safrany S.T. Shears S.B. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This sequence lacks the signal peptide necessary for translocation into the ER and was used to degrade cytosolic inositol polyphosphates. Although our cyt-MIPP had no ER signal peptide, recent reports have suggested that other internal peptide sequences can confer ER targeting (18Ouzzine M. Magdalou J. Burchell B. Fournel-Gigleux S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31401-31409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the only other published study using a truncated MIPP (19Chi H. Yang X. Kingsley P.D. O'Keefe R.J. Puzas J.E. Rosier R.N. Shears S.B. Reynolds P.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6496-6507Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) had both the signal peptide and the ER retention sequence removed, whereas in the current study the construct still had the ER retention sequence. To verify that the cyt-MIPP was indeed cytosolic and not ER-localized, a cyt-MIPP bearing a GFP tag was expressed in HIT M2.2.2 cells. Examination with confocal microscopy discerned that GFP-cyt-MIPP was present throughout the cytosol. There was no co-localization with the fluorescent ER marker Brefeldin A, BODYiPY 558/568 conjugate, Molecular Probes (data not shown). Our experience (20Leibiger B. Leibiger I.B. Moede T. Kemper S. Kulkarni R.N. Kahn C.R. de Vargas L.M. Berggren P.O. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 559-570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), along with the experience of many others (21Tsien R.Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 509-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (4841) Google Scholar), is that a GFP tag itself does not present a restriction for the entry of peptides into the ER. Changes in Inositol Polyphosphate Profile following cyt-MIPP Expression—In our initial experiments we established that cyt-MIPP expression decreased the concentration of its principal substrates, Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 and InsP6. Note, however, that only 30% of the cells were transfected (data not shown), so changes in concentration of inositol polyphosphates in a single cyt-MIPP-transfected cell were considerably underestimated because of the dilution with non-transfected cells. Fig. 1A indicates a significant 25% reduction in the concentrations of both Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 and InsP6 after cyt-MIPP expression. Next we wanted to assess the downstream products of Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 and InsP6 degradation. To enable us to detect changes in Ins(1,4,5)P3 resulting from cyt-MIPP transfection, we insured that little Ins(1,4,5)P3 was being generated from PtdIns(4,5)P2 by preincubating the cells for 45 min in medium with low glucose (0.1 mm) thereby creating a basal state. All subsequent data (unless stated otherwise) were obtained from cells preincubated in this manner. Fig. 2 presents a scheme depicting the putative products of cyt-MIPP-catalyzed metabolism of Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 and InsP6. There were significant increases in Ins(1,2,3)P3 (20%) and in peaks with the elution characteristics of d/l-Ins(1,4,6)P3 (56%) and Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 (79%) in cyt-MIPP-compared with mock-transfected cells, (data not shown). However, it is important to note that the concentrations of these inositol polyphosphates were initially so low (∼0.2 μm) that even an increased production is unlikely to have any cellular impact. These inositol polyphosphates could all be derived directly or indirectly from cyt-MIPP degradation of Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 and InsP6 (see Fig. 2). The shape of the mock- but not the cyt-MIPP-transfected Ins(1,4,5)P3 peak was skewed (data not shown), indicating that more than one InsP3 isomer was present in the peak. The fact that only the mock-transfected Ins(1,4,5)P3 peak was skewed suggests that this contaminant did not go up after cyt-MIPP transfection. Noteworthy is that the contribution of the contaminant to the Ins(1,4,5)P3 signal in the mock-transfected cells reduced our ability to detect an increase in genuine Ins(1,4,5)P3 against a high non-Ins(1,4,5)P3 background. In a previous study in normal mouse β-cells, the peak of Ins(1,4,5)P3 (14Barker C.J. Nilsson T. Kirk C.J. Michell R.H. Berggren P.O. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) also indicated contamination from an unknown InsP3, which masked bona fide Ins(1,4,5)P3. Thus, we used a commercial mass assay, specific for d-myo-Ins(1,4,5)P3, to determine the true increase in Ins(1,4,5)P3. We estimated that approximately half of the HPLC-resolved Ins(1,4,5)P3 was another InsP3. Fig. 1B illustrates a significant 36% increase in Ins(1,4,5)P3 concentration between cyt-MIPP- and mock-transfected cells, when only genuine Ins(1,4,5)P3 was measured. It is important to note that because of the 30% transfection rate (see above) the actual rise in concentration of Ins(1,4,5)P3 in a transfected cell would be considerably greater, about double the concentration in the mock-transfected cells. Thus cyt-MIPP expression significantly enhanced basal Ins(1,4,5)P3 concentration in intact cells and not just in vitro as has been reported previously (7Van Dijken P. de Haas J.R. Craxton A. Erneux C. Shears S.B. Van Haastert P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29724-29731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Effect on Basal [Ca2+]i—The next important question was whether this increased Ins(1,4,5)P3 impacted on cellular [Ca2+]i homeostasis. We therefore examined the [Ca2+]i homeostasis in cyt-MIPP-expressing cells. In contrast to the data derived for the inositol phosphates, which were obtained from batch-transfected cells, [Ca2+]i measurements were performed at the single cell level in cells identified by DsRed fluorescence after co-transfection with cyt-MIPP and DsRed. Because we only measured cells that had been transfected, eliminating non-transfected cells from consideration, we substantially improved the signal to noise ratio. HIT M2.2.2 cells transfected with cyt-MIPP or mock-transfected were loaded with the Ca2+-sensitive dye Fura-2/AM, and the [Ca2+]i in individual DsRed-positive cells were recorded using digital fluorescence imaging. Fig. 3 represents a quantification of basal [Ca2+]i in mock- and cyt-MIPP-transfected cells, determinations made in 45 separate cells from more than three separate preparations. Basal [Ca2+]i in cyt-MIPP-transfected cells was significantly higher (3-fold) than in mock-transfected cells (115.1 ± 4.1 versus 35.5 ± 2.5 nm ± S.E.). Untransfected cells had a [Ca2+]i similar to mock-transfected cells (data not shown). Because the parent HIT T15 cell line has a basal [Ca2+]i between 100 and 150 nm, the untransfected HIT M2.2.2 cells clearly have an abnormally low basal [Ca2+]i. Thus cyt-MIPP expression is able to raise the basal [Ca2+]i in HIT M2.2.2 cells to a more normal level. Effect on Glucose-stimulated Rise in [Ca2+]i—Next we wanted to clarify whether the changes in basal [Ca2+]i implemented by cyt-MIPP influenced the way that glucose, the principal stimulus of pancreatic β-cells, affected [Ca2+]i. Fig. 4A is a representative trace illustrating the stimulatory effect of glucose (16.7 mm) on [Ca2+]i. The Ca2+ responses of cyt-MIPP-transfected cells were considerably greater in amplitude and duration than the responses for the mock-transfected cells, which were rather feeble. Moreover, the pattern of multiple peaks in cyt-MIPP-transfected cells was not discerned in the mock-transfected cells. This pattern of multiple peaks has also been recorded in β-cell studies in which the RYR was sensitized (22Lemmens R. Larsson O. Berggren P.O. Islam M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9971-9977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and are thought to be representative of CICR. These data suggest that cyt-MIPP transfection was able to dramatically enhance the glucose-stimulated rise in [Ca2+]i in this previously poorly responsive insulin-secreting cell line. Thus it was important to understand the mechanism of this transformation in greater depth. In normal pancreatic β-cells the dominant mechanism whereby glucose raises [Ca2+]i is thought to be through the opening of voltage-dependent l-type Ca2+ channels (23Berggren P.O. Larsson O. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1994; 22: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To establish whether l-type Ca2+ channels were involved in the improved response in cyt-MIPP-expressing cells, we pretreated the cells with the specific l-type Ca2+ channel blocker nimodipine and then stimulated with glucose. Fig. 4B demonstrates that nimodipine abolished the small rise in [Ca2+]i seen in mock-transfected cells, suggesting that in mock-transfected cells the small glucose-stimulated rise in [Ca2+]i is dependent on l-type Ca2+ channels. In contrast, the overall increase in [Ca2+]i in cyt-MIPP-transfected cells was reduced by only 20% when nimodipine was applied (see Fig. 4B and accompanying legend). These data suggest that only a minor component of the glucose-induced [Ca2+]i rise in cyt-MIPP-expressing cells is dependent on influx of Ca2+ through l-type channels. However, the majority of the increase in [Ca2+]i in cyt-MIPP-expressing cells is coming from another source. So where is this Ca2+ coming from? The Ca2+ could come through another membrane Ca2+ channel or from intracellular stores or a combination of both. Fig. 4C indicates that removal of extracellular Ca2+ completely blocked the rise in [Ca2+]i elicited by glucose in cyt-MIPP-transfected cells. This suggests that if intracellular Ca2+ stores are involved they require the entry of extracellular Ca2+ to sustain the response. The most likely kind of mechanism would be a store-operated capacitative Ca2+ entry through the plasma membrane (24Putney Jr., J.W. Broad L.M. Braun F.J. Lievremont J.P. Bird G.S. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2223-2229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus Ca2+ influx via the l-type Ca2+ channel, and maybe more importantly, non-voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, played key parts in the restoration of the glucose-induced rise in [Ca2+]i in cyt-MIPP-expressing cells. Role of Voltage-dependent l-type Ca2+Channels—To address the role of voltage-dependent l-type Ca2+ channels in the improved Ca2+ response following cyt-MIPP expression in more detail, single channel activity was recorded, using the cell-attached mode of the patch clamp technique. Both mock- and cyt-MIPP-transfected cells were examined for l-type Ca2+ current. Transfected cells were identified by co-expression of GFP. Fig. 5A illustrates examples of Ba2+ currents flowing through single Ca2+ channels recorded from patches attached to cells subjected to mock transfection (left panel) and cyt-MIPP transfection (right panel), respectively. The cell transfected with cyt-MIPP displayed more frequent openings of the Ca2+ channel than the control cell. Open time (Fig. 5B) and current amplitude (Fig. 5C) distributions from the same recordings were fit by a single exponential function and exhibit Gaussian distributions with a clear separation between closed and open states, respectively. This indicates that only one channel was present in the patches recorded. Compiled data demonstrated that cyt-MIPP expression significantly increased open probability (Fig. 5E) and availability (Fig. 5F) of single l-type Ca2+ channels without influencing mean open time (Fig. 5D). Thus l-type Ca2+ channels from cyt-MIPP-transfected cells have changed characteristics that may favor increased Ca2+ flux into the cell. Examination of Intracellular Ca2+Stores—Fig. 4, B and C clearly indicate that a substantial amount of the glucose-induced [Ca2+]i rise is independent of Ca2+ entry through voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels and is coming through some other membrane channel. One mechanism for Ca2+ entry could be the emptying of intracellula"

In contrast, other antiterminators of this family are negatively regulated by phosphorylation of the first histidine in PRD1, and presumably activated by phosphorylation of the histidines in PRD2. In this work, a screen for mutant BglG proteins that escape repression by EIIBgl yielded exchanges of nine residues within PRD1, including conserved histidines His-101 and His-160, and C-terminally truncated proteins. Genetic and phosphorylation analyses indicate that His-101 in PRD1 is phosphorylated by EIIBgl and that His-160 contributes to negative regulation. His-208 in PRD2 is essential for BglG activity, suggesting that it is phosphorylated by HPr. Surprisingly, phosphorylation by HPr is not fully abolished by exchanges of His-208. However, phosphorylation by HPr is inhibited by exchanges in PRD1 and the phosphorylation of these mutants is restored in the presence of wild-type BglG. These results suggest that the activating phosphoryl group is transiently donated from HPr to PRD1 and subsequently transferred to His-208 of a second BglG monomer.

The bacterial phosphoenolpyruvate:carbohydrate phosphotransferase system (PTS) 1The abbreviations used are: PTSphosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) carbohydrate phosphotransferase systemEIenzyme I of the PTSHPrhistidine-containing protein of the PTSEIIBglaryl-β-glucoside-specific PTS transporter encoded by bglFCATco-antiterminatorPRDsPTS regulation domainsRATribonucleic antiterminatorIPTGisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. is central in uptake and utilization of various carbohydrates (reviewed in Ref. 1Postma P.W. Lengeler J.W. Jacobson G.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 543-595Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Primarily, it catalyzes a chain of phosphoryl transfer reactions toward the incoming carbohydrates. The first steps in this chain are the autophosphorylation of EI with PEP and subsequent transfer of the phosphoryl group from phospho-EI to HPr. Phospho-HPr is the general donor of phosphoryl groups to the various carbohydrate-specific transport proteins called enzymes II (EIIs). The EIIs consist of at least three domains, IIA, IIB, and IIC. HPr phosphorylates a histidine residue in domain IIA, from which the phosphoryl group is transferred to a residue in domain IIB, and from there to the sugar during its uptake by the integral membrane domain, IIC. Uptake of PTS substrates leads to dephosphorylation of the PTS proteins. The phosphorylation state of the PTS is measured to modulate the activity of a large number of proteins involved in carbohydrate uptake, in chemotaxis, and in gene regulation (2Lengeler J.W.

Transcriptional antiterminators of the BglG/SacY family are gene regulators directly controlled by PTS-catalyzed phosphorylations (reviewed in Refs. 5Rutberg B. Mol.

Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 685-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). They all control genes coding for EIIs and other functions involved in uptake and breakdown of PTS carbohydrates. All antiterminators carry a ∼55 residue long RNA-binding domain called CAT at the N terminus (9Manival X. Yang Y. Strub M.P. Kochoyan M. Steinmetz M. Aymerich S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5019-5029Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), followed by two homologous domains, which putatively receive the signals from the PTS and transmit them by their dimerization, and which are therefore called PRDs (PTS regulation domains; Ref. 6Stülke J. Arnaud M. Rapoport G. Martin-Verstraete I. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 865-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). PRDs are also found in DNA binding activators, which, together with antiterminators, form a superfamily (10Greenberg D.B. Stülke J. Saier Jr., M.H. Res. Microbiol. 2002; 153: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). BglG/SacY-type antiterminators allow readthrough of transcription at specific Rho-independent terminators present within the transcription units they control. They bind as dimers to a conserved sequence in the RNA called RAT, thereby preventing formation of the overlapping terminator stem loop structure. Each antiterminator controls the expression of an assigned EII, which negatively regulates its antiterminator. This is achieved by phosphorylation of the antiterminator in the absence of substrate for the respective EII. The antiterminator becomes dephosphorylated by its EII and thereby reactivated when substrate becomes available, as has been demonstrated first for the BglG/EIIBgl pair in Escherichia coli (11Amster-Choder O. Houman F. Wright A. Cell. 1989; 58: 847-855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 12Schnetz K. Rak B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5074-5078Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In this case, a direct transfer of phosphoryl groups from the phosphorylation site cysteine 24 in IIBBgl to BglG has been proposed (13Chen Q. Arents J.C. Bader R. Postma P.W. Amster-Choder O. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4617-4627Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). BglG regulates the bgl operon, which codes for BglG itself, EIIBgl, and other functions for uptake and utilization of aryl-β-glucosides (14Schnetz K. Toloczyki C. Rak B. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 2579-2590Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Andersen C. Rak B. Benz R. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 499-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Recent work has elucidated that some of the antiterminators, including BglG in E. coli, SacT and LicT in Bacillus subtilis, and LacT in Lactobacillus casei, are in addition positively controlled by HPr. These antiterminators have to be phosphorylated by HPr at a second site to gain activity (16Arnaud M. Vary P. Zagorec M. Klier A. Debarbouille M. Postma P.W. Rapoport G. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3161-3170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Gosalbes M.J. Monedero V. Perez-Martinez G. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3928-3934Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Görke B. Rak B.

This second phosphorylation event may provide a catabolite control mechanism to down-regulate activity of the antiterminators: when other, more favorable PTS-sugars, become available, the activating phosphoryl groups are withdrawn toward the preferred PTS-carbohydrate. The two antagonistic acting phosphorylations presumably modulate the transition from the inactive monomeric to the active dimeric form and vice versa. According to the current model these antiterminators exist in three different states, non-phosphorylated, phosphorylated by HPr, and multiple-phosphorylated by HPr and EII (reviewed for BglG in Refs. 3Gunnewijk M.G.W. van den Bogaard P.T.C.

Microbiol. 2002; 5: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). At physiological concentrations, exclusively, the HPr phosphorylated form, which appears in the presence of the respective substrate but absence of preferred PTS substrates, is believed to dimerize and to be active in vivo. Each PRD contains two highly conserved histidines, and all evidence suggests that they represent the phosphorylated sites (19Lindner C. Galinier A. Hecker M. Deutscher J. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 995-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 20Tortosa P. Declerck N. Dutartre H. Lindner C. Deutscher J. Le Coq D. Mol.

Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7037-7044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). BglG is an exception in that it lacks the second histidine within PRD2. Where investigated, the first conserved histidine in PRD1 was found to be crucial for negative control. Exchange of this histidine leads to constitutively high antitermination activity in vivo even in the absence of the specific substrate (20Tortosa P. Declerck N. Dutartre H. Lindner C. Deutscher J. Le Coq D. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 1381-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 24Bachem S. Stülke J. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5319-5326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Gosalbes M.J. Esteban C.D. Perez-Martinez G. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 695-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The second histidine in PRD1 participates in negative control of LicT and LacT (20Tortosa P. Declerck N. Dutartre H. Lindner C. Deutscher J. Le Coq D. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 1381-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 25Gosalbes M.J. Esteban C.D. Perez-Martinez G. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 695-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In contrast, the histidine(s) in PRD2 were shown to be necessary for activity of the dually controlled proteins SacT, LicT, and LacT (6Stülke J. Arnaud M. Rapoport G. Martin-Verstraete I. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 865-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 20Tortosa P. Declerck N. Dutartre H. Lindner C. Deutscher J. Le Coq D. Mol.

Microbiology. 2002; 148: 695-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), and preferential phosphorylation of these residues by HPr has been demonstrated for LicT (19Lindner C. Galinier A. Hecker M. Deutscher J. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 995-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, it has been proposed that these proteins are stimulated by HPr-dependent phosphorylation of the histidines in PRD2 and inhibited by EII-dependent phosphorylation of the first histidine in PRD1. However, quite different findings have been reported for BglG. In this case it was concluded that the conserved His-208 residue in PRD2 is the target of negatively acting phosphorylation by EIIBgl (26Chen Q. Engelberg-Kulka H. Amster-Choder O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17263-17268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Thus, no general rules appear to exist concerning the molecular mechanisms governing the regulation of this protein family (8van Tilbeurgh H. Declerck N. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 685-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 20Tortosa P. Declerck N. Dutartre H. Lindner C. Deutscher J. Le Coq D. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 1381-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The work presented here was initiated to define residues in BglG important for negative regulation by EIIBgl. Using a genetic screen a number of BglG variants that escape negative regulation by EIIBgl were identified. In addition, BglG mutants with different substitutions for His-208 were constructed. Analysis of activity and regulation of the various mutants in vivo demonstrates a direct role of PRD1 rather than PRD2 in negative control. The role of the histidyl residues in BglG resembles their counterparts in the other dually PTS-controlled antiterminators; His-101 and His-160 in PRD1 both contribute to negative control, whereas His-208 in PRD2 appears to be a target of activating phosphorylation. Protein phosphorylation studies confirmed that indeed His-101 is phosphorylated by EIIBgl, but yielded surprising results for the phosphorylation event directly catalyzed by HPr. The data suggest that HPr primarily donates its phosphoryl group to PRD1, from where it is subsequently transferred to the His-208 residue of a second BglG monomer within a dimer in a trans intramolecular reaction. Strains—The genotypes of E. coli strains are given in Table I. For phenotypic screening of mutant BglG proteins, strain R2243 was constructed as follows: First, the λPL-bglt2-lacZ cassette of plasmid pFDX3128 (see below) was integrated into the λ attachment site (attB) of strain R1279 as recently described (27Görke B. Rak B. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 131-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). From the resulting strain (R1735) a streptomycin-resistant mutant derivative was isolated, into which the F′ lacIq lacZΔM15 lacY+proA+proB+ episome was introduced by conjugation with strain BMH71-18. Strain constructions followed the procedures given by Miller (28Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics.

These plasmids and their derivatives are listed in Table V, and oligonucleotides used in this study are given in Table VI under Supplemental Materials, respectively. Details on construction of recombinant plasmids are also described under Supplemental Materials. Random Mutagenesis of bglG by Error-prone PCR and Isolation of Mutant bglG Alleles—Mutagenic PCRs were carried out according to Ref. 29Zhou Y. Zhang X. Ebright R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6052Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar. The 200-μl reactions were 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 50 μm of each dNTP, and contained 30 pmol of primers 619 and 620, 5 units of Taq polymerase and 2 fmol of the BspHI-SspI fragment of plasmid pFDX3736 (Fig. 2) as template. Primer 619 spans the AflII site in bglG and primer 620 spans the XbaI site between bglG and bglF and ends with the bglG stop codon at the 3′-end. Thirty cycles were carried out (1′ 94 °C, 2′ 59 °C, 3′ 72 °C). The PCR fragments were digested with AflII and XbaI and ligated to the XbaI-AflII vector moiety of plasmid pFDX3736. Recombinants were selected on MacConkey lactose plates containing tetracyclin (12.5 μg/ml). Plasmid DNAs of 100 Lac-positive colonies were isolated and subjected to restriction enzyme analysis. Plasmids with restriction patterns indistinguishable from that of the original plasmid pFDX3736 were reintroduced into strain R2243. All transformants retained the Lac+ phenotype. The transport function of EIIBgl encoded on the mutagenized plasmids was tested on MacConkey plates supplemented with arbutin and IPTG as inducer for expression of the bglG-bglF cassette. Arbutin is taken up by EIIBgl and is subsequently hydrolized by phospho-β-glucosidase A which is encoded by the constitutively expressed bglA gene that is not part of the bgl operon/regulon (30Prasad I. Young B. Schaefler S. J. Bacteriol. 1973; 114: 909-915Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Junne T. Schnetz K. Rak B. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6615-6616Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All but two transformants produced Arb-positive phenotypes indistinguishable from transformants with the original plasmid pFDX3736. Sequencing of the plasmids isolated from the two Arb-negative colonies revealed in both cases a spontaneous frameshift mutation within the 5′-part of the bglF gene. Determination of β-Galactosidase Activities—Assays were according to Miller (28Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1972Google Scholar) as described (32Schnetz K. Stülke J. Gertz S. Krüger S. Krieg M. Hecker M. Rak B. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1971-1979Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Enzyme activities are expressed in Miller units. In Vivo Protein Phosphorylation—Cells were labeled with HIn Vivo Protein Phosphorylation[32P]O4 as described (18Görke B. Rak B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3370-3379Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). For induction of tacOP-controlled gene expression, 0.1 mm IPTG was added. Proteins were separated on 13.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The experiments were carried out at least twice, yielding reproducible results. It should be noted that due to a change in laboratory during this study different electrophoresis systems were used. In Fig. 5 proteins were separated by a workshop-made electrophoresis system whereas in the other cases a Hoefer system was applied, explaining apparent differences in separation. The PRD-containing Moiety of BglG Is Essential for All Signal Reception from the PTS—The first step was a verification that the putative PRDs in BglG are the domains that relay the signals from the PTS to the RNA-binding domain by their dimerization. A chimeric BglG derivative was constructed in which the PRDs were replaced by the dimerization domain of an unrelated protein. The first 51 codons of bglG encoding the RNA-binding domain (CAT) were fused in-frame to codons 96–237 of the phage λ cI repressor gene encoding a flexible linker and its dimerization domain. To investigate whether the fusion protein is still subject to negative regulation, its gene was placed on a plasmid downstream of the IPTG-inducible tacOP either alone or together with the bglF gene (encoding EIIBgl) in tandem. For comparison, plasmids were analyzed that carried wild-type bglG alone or together with bglF or its mutant with a C24S exchange. Cys-24 represents the second phosphorylation site of EIIBgl and is essential for negative regulation of BglG (13Chen Q. Arents J.C. Bader R. Postma P.W. Amster-Choder O. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4617-4627Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To decide about the role of the PRDs in dimerization, a plasmid, which encoded only the CAT domain was additionally employed. The various expression plasmids were introduced into strain R1279 (Δbgl, Δlac) as well as its derivative R1653 lacking the ptsHIcrr operon (which encodes HPr, EI and IIAGlc, respectively), in order to determine whether activity of the CATΦλCI fusion protein is still modulated by phospho-HPr. Antitermination activity was tested using reporter plasmid pFDY226 (Fig. 1), which allows quantitative monitoring of BglG activity (18Görke B. Rak B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3370-3379Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The β-galactosidase enzyme activities were determined in the presence of different concentrations of IPTG (0, 0.05, 0.1, and 1 mm) to compare the antitermination activities at different expression levels (Fig. 1). This was important, because the intracellular concentration of BglG is crucial for its undisturbed regulation by the PTS (18Görke B. Rak B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3370-3379Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). As expected, expression of the bglG-bglF cassette in the pts-positive strain led to only low enzyme activities (Fig. 1A, bar 1) close to the background level of this system (= 37 units, the activity detected with plasmid pFDY226 alone; Ref. 18Görke B. Rak B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3370-3379Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In contrast, activities up to ∼1600 units at maximum expression levels (1 mm IPTG) were obtained in the absence of bglF or when the bglF-C24S allele was present (Fig. 1A, bars 2 and 3). These results reflect negative control of BglG by wild-type EIIBgl as well as its escape from this control in the presence of mutant EIIBgl-C24S (13Chen Q. Arents J.C. Bader R. Postma P.W. Amster-Choder O. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4617-4627Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 18Görke B. Rak B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3370-3379Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Expression of the bglG as well as the bglG-bglF-C24S cassette in the pts-negative strain led to drastically reduced activities when compared with the pts-positive strain (bars 2 and 3) due to the second level of activity control of BglG, which requires phosphorylation by HPr to be active (18Görke B. Rak B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3370-3379Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, as has been shown previously (18Görke B. Rak B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3370-3379Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), in the pts-negative background a considerable level of BglG activity is detectable at higher expression levels (induction with 1 mm IPTG), suggesting that the unphosphorylated BglG forms active dimers at high protein concentrations. A similar result has also been obtained for LicT (33Declerck N. Dutartre H. Receveur V. Dubois V. Royer C. Aymerich S. van Tilbeurgh H. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 671-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Expression of the CAT domain (BglG1–51) led to only background activities in both strains (bar 4), suggesting that the PRDs are indispensable for dimerization. However, upon a further increase of BglG1-51 expression using a more efficient ribosomal binding site, antitermination activity became again detectable (data not shown), suggesting that the CAT domain alone already has a weak potential to dimerize. Similar observations have been made for the CAT domains of SacY and LicT (9Manival X. Yang Y. Strub M.P. Kochoyan M. Steinmetz M. Aymerich S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5019-5029Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 34Declerck N. Vincent F. Hoh F. Aymerich S. van Tilbeurgh H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 389-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Antitermination activity was completely restored when the dimerization domain of λCI was fused to the CAT domain (Fig. 1, bar 5). Most importantly, activity of this fusion was constitutive and neither affected by the additional co-expression of bglF (bar 6) nor by the absence of the general pts genes (Fig. 1, bars 5 and 6) and is thus not subject to any PTS control. This demonstrates that the PRDs in BglG mediate both negative as well as positive control of activity by the PTS and that their dimerization is a prerequisite for antitermination. Amino Acid Exchanges in PRD1 and Truncations of PRD2 Account for a Release of Negative Control of BglG—To get an insight into the differential roles of the two PRDs in BglG activity control and to possibly identify the histidine(s) phosphorylated by EIIBgl and other residues involved in negative control, the DNA encompassing the two PRDs were mutated and screened for mutant BglG variants that escape repression by EIIBgl. The experimental strategy is outlined in Fig. 2. For identification of the mutants, strain R2243 was constructed, which carries a chromosomal λPL-bglt2-lacZ antitermination reporter cassette and exhibits a Lac-positive phenotype exclusively i"

We cloned a novel gene with considerable homology to RIBP/TSAd/Lad, an adaptor involved in T cell activation and interleukin-2 (IL-2) promoter activation. Expression of this gene is limited to the spleen and thymus. We have named this gene ALX, adaptor in lymphocytes of unknown function X. Because the related adaptor RIBP is involved in IL-2 regulation, we investigated whether ALX had a similar function. ALX overexpression in Jurkat T cells results in inhibition of IL-2 promoter activation after stimulation with superantigen. The IL-2 promoter contains several binding sites for transcription factors including the composite element RE/AP, which is the primary site of CD28 transcriptional activation. ALX overexpression had the greatest effect on the activation of a RE/AP reporter as opposed to an AP-1 reporter. Interestingly, ALX overexpression strongly inhibited RE/AP activation in response to anti-CD28/phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) stimulation but had minimal effect when anti-TCR/PMA was used. Therefore, it appears that ALX may function downstream of CD28 costimulation during T cell activation. In addition, the mobility of ALX shifts upon TCR/CD28 costimulation to a greater extent than what is observed with either stimulus alone demonstrating that ALX is a target of both TCR and CD28 costimulatory signaling pathways.

The activation of T cells is critical to the generation of an immune response. Minimally, two signals are required to activate resting T cells into effector T cells: an antigen-specific signal through the T cell receptor (TCR) 1The abbreviations used are: TCR, T cell receptor; IL-2, interleukin-2; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; SED, staphylococcal enterotoxin D; SEC2, staphylococcal enterotoxin C2; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; SH, Src homology; EST, expressed sequence tag; MEKK2, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase 2; RIBP, Rlk- and Itk-binding protein; TSAd, T cell SH2 domain-containing adaptor protein; Lad, Lck-associated adaptor.1The abbreviations used are: TCR, T cell receptor; IL-2, interleukin-2; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; SED, staphylococcal enterotoxin D; SEC2, staphylococcal enterotoxin C2; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; SH, Src homology; EST, expressed sequence tag; MEKK2, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase 2; RIBP, Rlk- and Itk-binding protein; TSAd, T cell SH2 domain-containing adaptor protein; Lad, Lck-associated adaptor. and a second antigen-independent “costimulatory” signal, which is primarily provided by CD28 in naïve T cells (reviewed in Ref. 1Chambers C.A. Allison J.P. Curr. Op. Immunol. 1997; 9: 396-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). The biochemical events immediately downstream of TCR engagement are well characterized, initiating with activation of Src family kinases Lck and Fyn, phosphorylation of tyrosines within ITAM motifs within CD3, and recruitment of Syk family kinases to the ITAM motifs. Their subsequent activation by Src family kinases leads to the recruitment of many signaling proteins to the site of T cell/APC interaction (reviewed in Ref. 2Mustelin T. Abraham R.T. Rudd C.E. Alonso A. Merlo J.J. Front. Biosci. 2002; 7: D918-D969Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The biochemical events downstream of CD28 and how they synergize with TCR signals to result in T cell activation are much less understood. A critical step in T cell activation is the induction of the IL-2 gene, which occurs through both a transcriptional up-regulation of its promoter and increased stability of its mRNA (3Jain J. Loh C. Rao A. Curr. Op. Immunol. 1995; 7: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 4Umlauf S.W. Beverly B. Kang S.-M. Brorson K. Tran A.-C. Schwartz R.H. Immunol. Rev. 1993; 133: 177-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).One molecule involved in TCR signaling is the adaptor molecule TSAd (also designated Lad, and for the mouse ortholog RIBP) (5Spurkland A. Brinchmann J.E. Markussen G. Pedeutour F. Munthe E. Lea T. Vartdal F. Aasheim H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4539-4546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This adaptor was identified in separate two-hybrid screens for proteins that associated with the Tec family kinases Rlk and Itk (6Rajogopal K. Sommers C.L. Decker D.C. Mitchell E.O. Kortbauer U. Sperling A.I. Kozak C.A. Love P.E. Bluestone J.A J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1657-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), the Src family kinase Lck (7Choi Y.B. Kim C.K. Yun Y. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 5242-5249PubMed Google Scholar), and the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase MEKK2 (8Sun, W., Kesavan, K., Schaefer, B. C., Garrington, T. P., Ware, M., Johnson, N. L., Gelfand, E. W., and Johnson, G. L. J. Biol. Chem., 276, 5093–5100Google Scholar). Although the mechanism of TSAd action is not well characterized, a role for TSAd in the regulation of IL-2 was demonstrated in the RIBP knock-out mouse (6Rajogopal K. Sommers C.L. Decker D.C. Mitchell E.O. Kortbauer U. Sperling A.I. Kozak C.A. Love P.E. Bluestone J.A J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1657-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These mice have no gross abnormalities in T cell development, but mature T cells show a moderate defect (∼70% decrease) in proliferation and IL-2 production upon TCR or TCR/CD28 stimulation. TSAd has been reported to localize to the cytoplasm in T cells and to translocate to the immunological synapse during T cell activation (8Sun, W., Kesavan, K., Schaefer, B. C., Garrington, T. P., Ware, M., Johnson, N. L., Gelfand, E. W., and Johnson, G. L. J. Biol. Chem., 276, 5093–5100Google Scholar), although it also has been reported to be primarily nuclear (9Marti F. Post N.H. Chan F. King P.D. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1425-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Although TSAd is reported to bind to and modulate the activity of several kinases (Lck, Itk, Rlk, and MEKK2) involved in the proximal events in T cell activation, TSAd is not expressed in resting, naïve T cells but rather is rapidly induced within hours of T cell activation, suggesting that it may not play a role in proximal events in T cell activation. Therefore, it is possible that another adaptor, belonging to the same family as TSAd, is present in naïve T cells and can mediate effects similar to those of TSAd.Redundancy is observed in many of the signaling pathways downstream of the TCR, and strong phenotypes or defects in TCR signaling may not be observed until multiple protein family members are deleted. Mice deficient in both Src family kinases Lck and Fyn have a more severe defect in T cell development than mice singly deficient in either Lck or Fyn (10van Oers N.S. Lowin-Kropf B. Finlay D. Connolly K. Weiss A. Immunity. 1996; 5: 429-436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Mice deficient in the Tec family kinases Itk and Txk/Rlk have mild defects in T cell function, whereas the doubly deficient animals reveal a critical role for Tec family kinases in T cell activation (11Schaeffer E.M. Broussard C. Debnath J. Anderson S. McVicar D.W. Schwartzberg P.L. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 987-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Such redundancy is observed for adaptor molecules as well. Mice deficient in STAM1 or STAM2 have no defect in T cell development or activation, whereas T cell-specific double mutations in STAM1 and STAM2 show a pronounced defect in T cell development (12Yamada M. Ishii N. Asao H. Murata K. Kanazawa C. Sasaki H. Sugamura K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8648-8658Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Therefore, one interpretation of the mild phenotype observed in the RIBP knockout mice is that the deficiency in RIBP may be compensated for by a related family member that is co-expressed in T cells. We report the identification and characterization of an adaptor related to TSAd, which we call ALX (adaptor in lymphocytes of unknown function X), that functions downstream of CD28 during T cell activation to regulate IL-2 transcription.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloning of a Complete ALX cDNA—To extend the 5′ end of the EST containing the putative coding sequence of ALX until a stop codon was reached in-frame, a 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends was performed using Marathon-Ready cDNA from the human spleen (BD Biosciences) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Three rounds of nested amplifications were performed using two 5′-primers corresponding to adaptors ligated to the ends of the cDNA (BD Biosciences) and three nested gene-specific primers to ALX. The resulting product was subcloned using the TOPO-TA cloning kit (Invitrogen). Individual plasmids were screened for the correct insert by the presence of an internal SmaI site present in ALX and subsequently sequenced. Clones with the extended 5′ sequence to ALX were checked by a BLAST search to determine whether the amplified product was continuous with genomic DNA. One isolated clone containing an ALX upstream sequence was not continuous with the genomic sequence, specifically lacking genomic sequences that were bound by consensus mRNA splice sites. Therefore, we concluded that this clone represented a true extension of the 5′-cDNA. This clone also contained an upstream stop codon in-frame with the ALX open reading frame. The first methionine after the stop codon was preceded by a sequence that nearly matched a consensus Kozak sequence for initiation suggesting that it is the translational start site. This proposed translation-initiation site was present in IMAGE 1307506 (belonging to the same Unigene cluster as the original IMAGE clone 711563), which, after 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends was performed, was shown to contain the entire ALX coding sequence. The human ALX nucleotide sequence was used in a NCBI BLAST search of the mouse EST data base to identify mouse ALX cDNA. A set of ESTs with considerable homology to human ALX was identified, and the ESTs with the largest inserts were sequenced. IMAGE 3998585 was found to contain the entire coding region of murine ALX, including a stop codon in-frame with the initiating ATG start codon in-frame. The nucleotide and protein sequences of human and murine ALX were submitted to GenBank™ (accession numbers AY319652 and AY319653, respectively).Plasmids, Antibodies, and Cell Lines Used—The RE/AP and AP-1 luciferase reporters have been described previously (13Shapiro V.S. Mollenauer M.N. Greene W.C. Weiss A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1663-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 14Shapiro V.S. Truitt K.E. Imboden J.B. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4051-4058Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The IL-2 promoter luciferase reporter was a generous gift from Gerry Crabtree. An untagged ALX expression construct was generated by subcloning the insert from a NotI/EcoRI digest of IMAGE number 1307506 into pcDEF3 (15Goldman L.A. Cutrone E.C. Kotenko S.V. Krause C.D. Langer J.A. BioTechniques. 1996; 21: 1013-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). To generate the YFP-tagged versions of ALX and TSAd, a PCR product was generated using primers that amplified amino acid two to the stop codon for insertion in-frame into pEYFP-C1 (BD Biosciences) using BglII/EcoRI. To generate the C-terminal myc/His-tagged version of ALX, a PCR product was generated using primers that amplified the complete coding region of ALX (without the stop codon), and it was ligated in-frame into pEF6/MYC-His B (Invitrogen). PCR-amplified ALX and TSAd were sequenced to ensure that unintentional mutations were not introduced. C305 is a monoclonal antibody specific to the clonotypic TCR of Jurkat T cells and was generously provided by Art Weiss, University of California, San Francisco (16Weiss A. Stobo J.D. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 160: 1284-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Anti-myc tag antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technologies (catalog no. 2276). Anti-CD28 antibodies were from Caltag (catalog no. MHCD-2800). Jurkat T cells were provided by Art Weiss (University of California, San Francisco). Jurkat T cells that stably express myc/His-tagged ALX were generated by electroporation with pEF6/MYC-His B-ALX plasmid and selected with blasticidin. Individual drug resistance clones were examined for expression of the myc/His-tagged ALX by Western blotting with anti-myc. CEM25 is a high TCR-expressing subline of the CEM human T cell line that was generated by subcloning CEM by limiting dilution and identifying a line with high TCR expression as compared with the parental (data not shown).Northern Analysis—A murine multiple-tissue Northern blot (First-Choice mouse blot 1, Ambion) was probed with a 315-bp PstI fragment from the murine ALX cDNA, using UltraHyb (Ambion) as per the manufacturer's instructions. The blot was visualized by autoradiography using Biomax MS film (Kodak) overnight at –80 °C using Tran-Screen HE intensifying screens (Kodak). The blot was subsequently stripped and reprobed for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase to verify the presence of RNA in samples that did not express ALX.Generation of Rabbit Polyclonal Antisera against ALX—A XmaI fragment of ALX, corresponding to the C terminus that is least conserved between ALX and TSAd, was subcloned into pGEX-3X (Amersham Biosciences). GST-ALX fusion protein was expressed in BL21 Codon-Plus (DE3)-RP (Stratagene), purified using glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), and cleaved from glutathione S-transferase using Factor Xa (New England Biolabs) as per the manufacturers' instructions. Recombinant ALX was sent to Cocalico Biologicals for generation of rabbit polyclonal antisera using a standard 90-day protocol. Three rabbits were each injected with a total of 500 μg of purified recombinant ALX. To verify specificity of the antisera, 293T cells were transfected with 1 μg of pEYFP-C1 (BD Biosciences), YFP-ALX, or YFP-TSAd with FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Twenty four hours later, Nonidet P-40 lysates were generated and examined by Western blotting with anti-YFP (to verify expression of all three constructs) and polyclonal antisera from rabbit 1576T (to demonstrate specificity of the antisera for ALX). This anti-ALX antisera (1576T) was used in all experiments.Transfections and Luciferase Assays—Transfections, stimulations, and luciferase assays were performed as described previously (14Shapiro V.S. Truitt K.E. Imboden J.B. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4051-4058Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 17Shapiro V.S. Mollenauer M.N. Weiss A. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4051-4058Google Scholar). Briefly, 15 × 106 Jurkat T cells or CEM25 T cells were washed once and resuspended in 0.4 ml of serum-free RPMI. 20 μg of reporter or various amounts of expression plasmid (see legend for Fig. 4) were added. Electroporation was performed using a Gene Pulser II (Bio-Rad) at 250 V and 950 microfarads. Cells were resuspended in 10 ml of RPMI with 5% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). The following day, live cells were counted by trypan blue exclusion (Bio-Whittaker), and 105 cells/sample were stimulated as denoted in Figs. 4, 5, and 6. Cells were left either unstimulated or stimulated with antibodies to TCR (C305, 1:1000 final dilution), CD28 (1 μg/ml), and/or with 5 ng/ml PMA and/or 1 μm ionomycin (Calbiochem) for 7 h. Alternately, transfected cells were stimulated with superantigen presented by Raji B cells for 16 h. Jurkat T cells were stimulated with 300 ng/ml SED (staphylococcal enterotoxin D, Toxin Technology). CEM25 cells were stimulated with 300 ng/ml SEC2 (staphylococcal enterotoxin C2, Toxin Technology). Luciferase assays were performed as described previously (14Shapiro V.S. Truitt K.E. Imboden J.B. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4051-4058Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar).Fig. 5ALX overexpression inhibits RE/AP but not AP-1 activation. Jurkat or CEM25 T cells were transfected with a RE/AP or AP-1 reporter with 2.0 μg of pEYFP-C1 vector alone or ALX or TSAd expression constructs. The following day, cells were left either unstimulated or stimulated with superantigen (SED for Jurkat and SEC2 for CEM25) presented by Raji B cells for 16 h.

Total peripheral blood mononuclear cell lysate and cytoplasmic lysate from purified CD4+ T cells were gifts from Randy Cron (Children's Hospital of Philadelphia) and Jim Riley and Gary Koretzky (University of Pennsylvania). Briefly, lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore), and examined using rabbit 1576 polyclonal antisera against ALX at a final dilution of 1:1000. The blot was stripped and reprobed with anti-ERK1/2 as a control (p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase, Cell Signaling Technologies, catalog no. 9102).RESULTSIdentification of ALX, an Adaptor Related to TSAd—While examining Jurkat T cell microarray data, we found an EST (IMAGE no. 711563) that demonstrated considerable homology when translated and compared with the SH2 domain of TSAd, and we hypothesized that this gene could be related to TSAd and also play a role in T cell activation. The large open reading frame extended through to the 5′ end of this clone. Consequently, we used 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends to isolate further upstream sequences of the cDNA until a stop codon was reached in-frame with the large open reading frame. Translation of this large open reading frame predicted a protein containing 352 amino acids with considerable homology to TSAd (Fig. 1). We have designated this gene ALX, for adaptor in lymphocytes of unknown function X. Performing a BLAST search, we identified an EST that contained the complete cDNA for the murine homolog of ALX. Comparison of the mouse and human ALX protein sequences demonstrated that they share a 52% identity (Fig. 1). Like TSAd, the ALX protein contains a single SH2 domain and several potential sites for protein-protein interactions including several polyproline PXXP (SH3-binding) motifs and potential sites of tyrosine phosphorylation (a tyrosine closely preceded by an acidic residue). The similar size, relative placement of the SH2 domain, and potential sites of protein-protein interaction, as well as the degree of homology (35%), all indicate that ALX might be functionally related to TSAd and represent the second member of a new family of adaptor molecules (Fig. 1).Fig. 1Amino acid sequence of ALX. a, schematic representation of the adaptors TSAd and ALX showing similar placement of protein-protein interaction sites including a single N-terminal SH2 domain, potential sites of tyrosine phosphorylation, and polyproline PXXP sites. b, alignment of protein sequences of TSAd, RIBP, and human and mouse ALX (hALX and mALX, respectively). A ClustalW alignment was performed using MacVector (Genetics Computer Group). Positions are highlighted in the alignment where an identical or similar amino acid is present in at least three of the four proteins. The GenBank™ accession numbers for the human and mouse ALX nucleotide/protein sequences are AY319652 and AY319653, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)ALX Expression Is Limited to Hematopoietic Cells, Primarily Lymphocytes—To determine the tissue distribution of ALX expression, a murine multiple-tissue Northern blot was examined (Ambion FirstChoice Mouse Blot 1). Because there is substantial homology between mouse RIBP and ALX in the SH2 domain, a probe was chosen corresponding to the C terminus of ALX, which is not well conserved between ALX and RIBP. The 315-bp PstI mouse ALX probe chosen was 46% identical to the corresponding sequence in RIBP, too low to cross-hybridize in standard blotting conditions. In addition, this PstI probe was compared with the NCBI mouse EST data base and did not show any significant homology to any other transcript. Therefore, this probe should be specific to ALX. As shown in Fig. 2, the ALX message is ∼2.2 kb in size. The ALX message was found only in the spleen and thymus. As a control for the total RNA levels in each lane, the blot was stripped and reprobed for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Significant levels of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase expression were found in every tissue except testes. Therefore, we can conclude that ALX is not expressed in the heart, brain, liver, kidney, embryo, lung, or ovary, although ALX expression in testes cannot be ruled out.Fig. 2ALX mRNA expression is limited to hematopoietic tissues. A mouse multiple-tissue Northern blot (Ambion) was probed with mouse ALX cDNA (upper blot) or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNA (lower blot). RNA size markers are shown on the left. The tissues used in each lane are labeled at the top of the blot.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To verify that ALX protein is expressed in hematopoietic cells, ALX-specific antisera was generated and used to examine ALX protein expression by Western blotting of cytoplasmic extracts of several human hematopoietic cell lines, as well as total peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and purified (greater than 95%) CD4+ T cells. As shown in Fig. 3a, the anti-ALX antisera recognized ALX but not TSAd in lysates from transiently transfected 293T cells (although both proteins were expressed as demonstrated by blotting with antibodies to the YFP tag). The endogenous expression of ALX in normal cells and cell lines is shown in Fig. 3b. As a control to demonstrate electrophoretic mobility of ALX, 293T cells were transfected with vector or with an untagged ALX expression construct (Fig. 3b, lanes 1 and 2). Based upon a coding sequence of 352 amino acids, the ALX protein ran substantially slower than its predicted molecular mass of 39 kDa. ALX was strongly expressed in all of the B cell lines examined (Raji, Arp-1, and Ark-1) and in two of the three T cell lines examined (CEM and HUT78). In Jurkat cells, although ALX message was detectable (data not shown), only a minute amount of ALX protein was detected. ALX was found to be expressed in the cytoplasmic extract from normal human tissue, being present in total peripheral blood mononuclear cells extract and purified CD4+ T cells. ALX was not present in the K562 erythroleukemia cell line or the 293T human embryonic kidney cell line. As a control, the membrane was stripped and reprobed with anti-ERK1/2 (p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase). Therefore, ALX is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells, particularly lymphocytes. The molecular weight of the endogenous ALX protein matched our untagged ALX expression construct, confirming our conclusion from 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends that we had cloned the entire ALX coding sequence. In the course of the work presented here, the predicted protein sequence of a gene designated HSH2 was reported (18Oda T. Muramatsu M. Isogai T. Masuho Y. Asano S. Yamashita T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 1078-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In this report, the initiating methionine was not conclusively identified, as the open reading frame extended through to the 5′ end of the clone, and protein expression was not determined. However, it should be noted that the sequence of ALX matches the predicted protein sequence of HSH2.Fig. 3Expression of ALX protein in T and B cells. a, specificity of the anti-ALX antisera. 293T cells were transfected with 1 μg of pEYFP-C1 vector, YFP-ALX, or YFP-TSAd as denoted in the figure. Nonidet P-40 whole cell extracts were prepared ∼24 h after transfection and examined by Western blotting (WB) for expression of either the YFP constructs using anti-YFP antisera (Clontech) or 1576T anti-ALX antisera. Arrows denote the mobility of the YFP constructs. b, Nonidet P-40 whole cell extracts were prepared from several hematopoietic cell lines and analyzed for expression of ALX protein using anti-ALX antisera. As a control, 293T cells were transfected with either vector control or untagged ALX expression construct to define the specific ALX band in the Western blot. Arrows denote the specific ALX band or a nonspecific (NS) band. Cell extracts from normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and purified (95%) CD4+ T cells as well as from the non-hematopoietic cell line 293T (human embryonic kidney) were also examined. The blot was stripped and reprobed with antibodies to ERK1/2 as a control for total protein level. Note that in lanes 1 and 2 significantly lower total protein was loaded, resulting in a greatly decreased signal for ERK1/2 as compared with the other samples.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)ALX Overexpression in Jurkat T Cells Inhibits IL-2 Promoter Activation—T cells from RIBP-deficient mice (the murine ortholog of human TSAd) produce decreased IL-2 upon T cell stimulation demonstrating that TSAd/RIBP functions as a positive regulator of T cell activation.

This is not unusual for an adaptor/scaffolding protein, because overexpression may disrupt the stoichiometry of a complex, giving the appearance of being a negative regulator of signaling. To determine whether ALX and TSAd may have similar functions, we compared the effects of ALX and TSAd overexpression on IL-2 promoter activation using YFP-tagged proteins. As shown in Fig. 4, and as has been demonstrated previously, overexpression of TSAd in Jurkat T cells inhibited IL-2 promoter activity (19Sundvold V. Torgersen K.M. Post N.H. Marti F. King P.D.

https://openalex.org/W2021145037,"The ETS family transcriptional repressor TEL is frequently disrupted by chromosomal translocations, including the t(12;21) in which the second allele of TEL is deleted in up to 90% of the cases. Consistent with its role as a putative tumor suppressor, TEL expression inhibits colony formation by Ras-transformed NIH 3T3 cells and hinders proliferation of a variety of cell types. Although we observed no alteration in the cell cycle of TEL-expressing cells, we did find a marked increase in apoptosis of serum-starved TEL-expressing NIH 3T3 cells. This decrease in cell survival required the DNA binding domain of TEL, suggesting that TEL repressed an anti-apoptotic gene. These observations prompted us to search for genes regulated by ETS family proteins that regulate apoptosis. The anti-apoptotic molecule Bcl-XL contains multiple ets-factor binding sites within its promoters, and TEL repressed a Bcl-XL promoter-linked reporter gene. Moreover, the enforced expression of TEL decreased the endogenous expression of both Bcl-XL mRNA and protein. TEL-mediated repression of Bcl-XL likely affects cell survival via regulation of the apoptotic pathway."

The issue was addressed in this study. HLA-B27-bound peptide repertoires from human and murine cells overlapped by 75–85%, indicating that many endogenous HLA-B27 ligands are generated and presented in both species. Of 20 differentially presented peptides that were sequenced, only 40% arose from obvious inter-species protein polymorphism, suggesting that differences in antigen processing-loading accounted for many species-specific ligands. Digestion of synthetic substrates with human and murine 20 S proteasomes revealed cleavage differences that accounted for or correlated with differential expression of particular peptides. One HLA-B27 ligand found only in human cells was similarly generated in vitro by human and murine proteasomes. Differential presentation correlated with significantly decreased amounts of this ligand in human tapasin-deficient cells reconstituted with murine tapasin, indicating that species-specific interactions between HLA-B27, tapasin, and/or other proteins in the peptide-loading complex influenced presentation of this peptide.

However, antigen presentation by HLA-B27 or any other HLA class I molecule expressed on murine cells implies some inherent differences, relative to human cells, that have not been sufficiently characterized at a molecular level. Thus, species-related differences in the proteome, in proteasome cleavage specificity, in the peptide specificity of the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP), and in the interaction of the human class I molecule with human or murine tapasin or other proteins in the peptide-loading complex, all might influence the HLA-B27-bound peptide repertoire and antigen presentation upon expression on murine cells. Numerous studies have addressed the peptide-transporting preferences of human and murine TAP (reviewed in Refs. 17Schmitt L. Tampe R. Chembiochemistry. 2000; 1: 16-35Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 18Lankat-Buttgereit B. Tampe R. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 187-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), but the actual influence of species-related differences in this and other steps of the processing-loading pathway on HLA class I-mediated antigen presentation in murine cells is little known. Knowledge of such differences is critical for assessing the validity of HLA class I transgenic models for antigen presentation and human disease. In this study, we have comparatively analyzed the HLA-B27-bound peptide repertoires expressed on human and murine cells and have characterized the origin of the differential expression of multiple HLA-B27 ligands in only one cell type. The results indicate a substantial lack of overlap between both peptide repertoires, which is only partially explained by species- or cell type-related protein differences. Both proteasome specificity differences and heterologous interactions in the peptide-loading complex contribute to differential peptide presentation by HLA-B27 on either human or murine cells. Our results have general implications for human MHC class I-mediated antigen presentation in murine systems. Cell Lines and Monoclonal Antibodies—HMy2.C1R (C1R) is a human lymphoid cell line with low expression of its endogenous class I antigens (19Storkus W.J. Howell D.N. Salter R.D. Dawson J.R. Cresswell P. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 1657-1659PubMed Google Scholar, 20Zemmour J. Little A.M. Schendel D.J. Parham P. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 1941-1948PubMed Google Scholar). B*2705-C1R transfectant cells were described elsewhere (21Calvo V. Rojo S. Lopez D. Galocha B. Lopez de Castro J.A. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 4038-4045PubMed Google Scholar). P815-HTR (P815) is a murine mastocytome cell line. B*2705-P815 transfectant cells were previously described (22Rojo S. Lopez D. Calvo V. Lopez de Castro J.A. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 634-642PubMed Google Scholar). Both the human and murine transfectants express high and similar HLA-B27 levels (23Galocha B. Lopez D. Lopez de Castro J.A. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 1653-1662PubMed Google Scholar). These were periodically checked by flow cytometry to ensure stable expression of this molecule. The C1R and P815 cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 7.5% fetal bovine serum (both from Invitrogen, Paisley, UK). 721.220 is a human lymphoblastoid cell line (a gift from Dr. James McCluskey, University of Melbourne, Australia) in which HLA-A and HLA-B genes have been deleted and a non-functional tapasin protein is expressed (24Greenwood R. Shimizu Y. Sekhon G.S. DeMars R. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 5525-5536PubMed Google Scholar, 25Copeman J. Bangia N. Cross J.C. Cresswell P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 3783-3791Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This cell line expresses low levels of endogenous HLA-Cw*0102. Transfections of HLA-B*2705 and wild type human or murine tapasin into 721.220 have been previously described (26Peh C.A. Burrows S.R. Barnden M. Khanna R. Cresswell P. Moss D.J. McCluskey J. Immunity. 1998; 8: 531-542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). These cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The mAb used in this study were W6/32 (IgG2a, specific for a monomorphic HLA-A, -B, and -C determinant) (27Barnstable C.J. Bodmer W.F. Brown G. Galfre G. Milstein C. Williams A.F. Ziegler A. Cell. 1978; 14: 9-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1598) Google Scholar) and ME1 (IgG1, specific for HLA-B27, -B7, and -B22) (28Ellis S.A. Taylor C. McMichael A. Hum. Immunol. 1982; 5: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Flow Cytometry—About 6 × 104 cells were washed twice in 200 μl of PBS and resuspended in 50 μl of undiluted mAb supernatant. After incubating 30 min, cells were washed twice in 200 μl of PBS and resuspended in 50 μl of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG rabbit antiserum (Calbiochem-Novabiochem GmbH, Schwalbach, Germany), incubated for 30 min, and washed two times in 200 μl of PBS. All operations were done at 4 °C. Flow cytometry was carried out on a BD Biosciences FACSCalibur instrument using CellQuest software. Isolation of B*2705-bound Peptides—This was carried out from 1010 C1R or P815 transfectant cells lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 in the presence of a mixture of protease inhibitors, after immunopurification of HLA-B27 with the W6/32 mAb and acid extraction, exactly as described elsewhere (29Paradela A. Garcia-Peydro M. Vazquez J. Rognan D. Lopez de Castro J.A. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 5481-5490PubMed Google Scholar). HLA-B27-bound peptide pools were fractionated by HPLC at a flow rate of 100 μl/min as previously described (30Paradela A. Alvarez I. Garcia-Peydro M. Sesma L. Ramos M. Vazquez J. Lopez de Castro J.A. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and 50-μl fractions were collected. Mass Spectrometry Analysis and Sequencing—The peptide composition of HPLC fractions was analyzed by matrix-assisted desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) MS using a calibrated Kompact Probe instrument (Kratos-Shimadzu) operating in the positive linear mode, as previously described (30Paradela A. Alvarez I. Garcia-Peydro M. Sesma L. Ramos M. Vazquez J. Lopez de Castro J.A. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Alternatively, a Bruker Reflex™ III MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker-Franzen Analytic GmbH, Bremen, Germany) equipped with the SCOUT™ source in positive ion reflector mode was also used, as described elsewhere (31Alvarez I. Sesma L. Marcilla M. Ramos M. Martí M. Camafeita E. Lopez de Castro J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32729-32737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Peptide sequencing was carried out by quadrupole ion trap nanoelectrospray MS/MS in an LCQ instrument (Finnigan ThermoQuest, San Jose, CA), as previously described (32Yague J. Vazquez J. Lopez de Castro J.A. Tissue Antigens. 1998; 52: 416-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 33Marina A. Garcia M.A. Albar J.P. Yague J. Lopez de Castro J.A. Vazquez J. J. Mass Spectrom. 1999; 34: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In a few cases microelectrospray MS/MS was used, using the same procedure, except that samples were injected, through an HPLC equipped with a C18 capillary column (150 × 0.18 mm) connected online, at a flow rate of 1.5 μl/min. In some cases, peptide sequencing was also done by post-source decay (PSD)-MALDI-TOF MS, as previously described (31Alvarez I. Sesma L. Marcilla M. Ramos M. Martí M. Camafeita E. Lopez de Castro J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32729-32737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In all cases peptide-containing HPLC fractions were dried and resuspended in 5 μl of methanol/water (1:1) containing 0.1% formic acid. Aliquots of 0.5 or 1 μl were used for MALDI-TOF or nanoelectrospray MS analyses, respectively. For microelectrospray MS/MS-dried samples were resuspended in 0.5% acetic acid. Synthetic Peptides—Peptides were synthesized using the standard solid-phase Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry and were purified by HPLC. The correct composition and molecular mass of purified peptides were confirmed by amino acid analysis using a 6300 Amino Acid Analyzer (Beckman Coulter, Palo Alto, CA), which also allowed their quantification, and MALDI-TOF MS, respectively. Purification of 20 S Proteasome—The 20 S proteasome was purified from 3 × 109 B*2705-C1R or B*2705-P815 cell lysates by ion-exchange chromatography and centrifugation in a glycerol gradient as previously described (30Paradela A. Alvarez I. Garcia-Peydro M. Sesma L. Ramos M. Vazquez J. Lopez de Castro J.A. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Proteasome-containing fractions from the previous purification step were identified by 12% SDS-PAGE and further subjected to anion-exchange chromatography by fast protein liquid chromatography using a Mono-Q SR5/5 column (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden), at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, as follows: isocratic conditions with buffer A (50 mm Tris/HCl, 50 mm KCl, pH 8) for 1 h, followed by a linear gradient of 0–100% buffer B (50 mm Tris/HCl, 0.5 m KCl, pH 8) for 1 h. Purity of the fractions was assessed by SDS-PAGE. Aliquots of purified proteasome were stored at –80 °C. Absence of contaminant proteases in the 20 S proteasome samples was assessed by inhibition of proteolytic cleavage of a synthetic peptide substrate, histone 2A-(77–105), with the irreversible proteasome inhibitors lactacystine (50 μg/ml) and epoxomicin (1 μg/ml). Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis of 20 S Proteasomes—Samples of purified 20 S proteasomes were loaded by hydration of immobilized pH gradient (IPG) strips, non-linear pH 3–10, of 18-cm length (Amersham Biosciences), previously diluted to a total volume of 350 μl in 6 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 2% CHAPS, IPG non-linear pH 3–10, 1 mm Tris-(2-carboxymethyl)phosphine-HCl, and bromphenol blue. In the first dimension, IEF was performed in a IPGphor (Amersham Biosciences) under the following conditions: 30 V for 6 h, 60 V for 6 h, 500 V for 30 min, 1,000 V for 30 min, a gradient of 1,000–8,000 V for 30 min, and 8,000 V up to 32,000 Vh. After IEF, strips were equilibrated in 6 m urea, 30% glycerol, 2% SDS, and bromphenol blue, twice for 20 min. Dithiothreitol (2%) and 4% iodoacetamide were added in the first and second equilibration steps, respectively. The second dimension was performed using 12.5% SDS-PAGE. Gels were stained with silver nitrate and analyzed using the software ImageMaster (Amersham Biosciences). Spots were assigned by tryptic digestion followed by MS fingerprinting. Digestion of Synthetic Substrates—Peptide substrates (125 μg/ml) were incubated at 37 °C with purified 20 S proteasome at an enzyme/substrate ratio of 1:10 (w/w) in 20 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.6. Digestion was stopped by adding 1/5 volume of 0.4% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid. Digestion mixtures were dried down to 100 μl in a Speed-Vac and fractionated by HPLC using the same conditions as for HLA-B27-bound peptides. Individual digestion products were identified on the basis of their molecular mass by MALDI-TOF MS and, when necessary for unambiguous assignment, by PSD-MALDI-TOF or electrospray MS/MS sequencing. HLA-B27 Presents Distinct Peptide Repertoires on Human and Murine Cells—Peptide pools were isolated by acid extraction from HLA-B*2705 immunopurified from C1R and P815 transfectant cells and fractionated by HPLC under identical conditions and consecutive runs. The peptide composition of correlative HPLC fractions from both peptide pools were systematically compared by MALDI-TOF MS, using the same strategy as previously used to compare HLA-B27 subtype-bound peptide repertoires (34Sesma L. Montserrat V. Lamas J.R. Marina A. Vazquez J. Lopez de Castro J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16744-16749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 35Ramos M. Paradela A. Vazquez M. Marina A. Vazquez J. Lopez de Castro J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28749-28756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In short, the MS spectrum of any given HPLC fraction from one peptide pool was compared with the MS spectra of the correlative, previous, and following HPLC fractions from the other peptide pool. This was done to account for slight shifts in retention time that may occur between consecutive chromatographic runs. Ion peaks of the same (±1) mass-to-charge (m/z) ratio and retention time were considered to reflect shared peptides on human and murine cells. Identity of retention time and m/z does not necessarily indicate peptide identity, because in very complex mixtures unrelated peptides sharing these features might eventually co-elute. However, it is reasonable to assume that the over-whelming majority of identical peptide masses compared correspond to identical peptides. Indeed, in four of four cases in which ion peaks of the same m/z and retention time were sequenced from both the human and murine peptide pools they corresponded to identical peptides (Fig. 1). In nine additional cases a peptide sequenced from the murine peptide pool showed an identical counterpart in the human pool known from previous sequencing studies of HLA-B27-bound peptides from C1R cells to be the same peptide (Fig. 1). Ion peaks found in only one cell type in two independent experiments were considered as differentially expressed peptides. A total of 1372 and 1551 molecular species were compared from C1R and P815, respectively (Table I). Of these, 211 (15%) and 390 (25%) peptides were found only in human or in murine cells, respectively. In addition, of 351 shared peptides that showed particularly strong intensity signals in the MALDI-TOF spectra of at least one cell line, 54 (15%) and 82 (23%) showed 10-fold or higher intensity in the human or murine cells in two independent experiments, respectively. This is consistent with substantially higher expression of the shared ligand in the corresponding cell line. No significant differences in the average size of peptides expressed on either cell type were found (Table I).Table IComparison of HLA-B*2705-bound peptides from human and murine cellsC1R-B*2705P815-B*2705Total peptides compared13721551Mass range860-1667 Da860-1667 DaAverage mass1154 Da1154 DaShared peptides1161 (85%)1161 (75%)Specific peptides211 (15%)390 (25%)Average mass of shared peptides1144 Da1144 DaAverage mass of specific peptides1205 Da1193 DaMajor peaks countedaIon peaks that showed particularly strong intensity in the MALDI-TOF spectrum from one or both cell lines.351351Quantitative differencesbIon peaks that showed 10-fold or more intensity in the MALDI-TOF spectrum from one cell line.54 (15%)82 (23%)a Ion peaks that showed particularly strong intensity in the MALDI-TOF spectrum from one or both cell lines.b Ion peaks that showed 10-fold or more intensity in the MALDI-TOF spectrum from one cell line. Open table in a new tab The reproducibility of the MALDI-TOF spectra was assessed in two ways: by obtaining independent spectra from the same sample and by performing two independent comparisons with different peptide preparations. In both cases, the MS spectra of the same, or equivalent, HPLC fraction were in general very reproducible both in the nature of the ion peaks detected and in their relative intensities, although occasionally some variation was found. For this reason, assignment of both qualitative and quantitative differences was always done on the basis of reproducibility in two independent experiments. These results indicate that the HLA-B27-bound peptide repertoires on human and murine cells, although highly overlapping, contain a significant number of differentially bound ligands, as well as shared ones presented at substantially different amounts Murine TAP Does Not Impair Presentation of B*2705 Ligands with C-terminal Basic Residues—A total of 27 shared ligands, including 3 octamers, 13 nonamers, 7 decamers, 3 undecamers, and 1 dodecamer, were sequenced by MS (Fig. 1). In addition, the sequence of 20 B*2705 ligands found only in human (9 peptides) or murine cells (11 peptides) was also determined (Fig. 2). All shared peptides corresponded to conserved sequences between both species. All the peptides sequenced contained the canonic anchor motif of HLA-B27, Arg2. Shared ligands also presented the same variety of C-terminal peptide residues previously defined for HLA-B*2705 ligands from human cells, including aliphatic, aromatic, and basic residues. The number of shared ligands with C-terminal basic residues was 6 of 27. Among differential peptides (Fig. 2), 5 of 11 found only in C1R cells and 2 of 11 found only in P815 cells showed a C-terminal basic motif. Thus, of a total of 36 peptides from human cells and 38 peptides from murine cells, 11 (31%) and 8 (21%), respectively, contained C-terminal basic residues. The percentage from human cells is nearly the same as that (32%) previously reported in an independent compilation (36Lamas J.R. Paradela A. Roncal F. Lopez de Castro J.A. Arthritis Rheum. 1999; 42: 1975-1985Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and is only moderately higher than the percentage of B*2705 ligands with C-terminal basic residues found in murine cells. These results strongly suggest that the low preference of murine TAP for C-terminal basic residues reported from in vitro transport studies (37Momburg F. Roelse J. Howard J.C. Butcher G.W. Hammerling G.J. Neefjes J.J. Nature. 1994; 367: 648-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) introduces little bias against presentation of peptides with these motifs by HLA-B27 on murine cells. Differential Presentation of HLA-B27 Ligands Is Only Partially Due to Protein Polymorphism—The 20 B*2705 ligands found only in either human or murine cells that were sequenced could be classified in three subsets (Fig. 2). Group 1, which included two peptides (10%), consisted of ligands arising from species- or cell type-specific proteins. Group 2, which included six peptides (30%), consisted of ligands arising from proteins present on both cell types but differing in one or more residues within the sequence of the peptide. Group 3, which included 12 peptides (60%) consisted of ligands arising from proteins that are either identical in both cell types (i.e. the HLA-B27 and human β2m transgene products) or identical in the region corresponding to the peptide ligand and its neighborhood. Thus, less than half of the species- or cell type-related differences in the HLA-B27-bound peptide repertoire are explained by obvious differences in the parental proteins (groups 1 and 2). These results imply that differential processing, transport, and/or loading have a significant influence on differential peptide presentation by HLA-B27 on human or murine cells. Distinct Proteasomal Cleavage Contributes to Differential Presentation of HLA-B27 Ligands—To assess the contribution of proteasomal processing to differential expression of particular HLA-B27 ligands in one cell type, we used synthetic precursors of four differentially expressed ligands from group 3 (Fig. 2), including two peptides found only in C1R cells and two others found only in P815 cells, with the sequence of the parental proteins in and around the sequence of the ligand. Each of these substrates was digested in vitro, in parallel experiments, with 20 S proteasomes purified from C1R and from P815 cells. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis analysis indicated that both the human and murine proteasome preparations contained a mixture of proteasome and immunoproteasome. The proteasome/immunoproteasome ratio was similar in both cases, within the limits of the technique used, as judged from the relative intensities of the spots corresponding to β1/β1i and β2/β2i subunits (the murine β5 subunit did not appear in the two-dimensional gel due to its very basic pI) in the human and murine samples (Fig. 3). This technique does not allow us to rule out putative small differences in proteasome composition between cell lines, due to inaccuracies inherent to silver staining, whose intensity is variable for different proteins. However, given the similarity in proteasome/immunoproteasome composition between both cell lines, it is very unlikely that the cleavage differences observed (described below: Figs. 4,5,6,7), in particular differential cleavage of specific peptide bonds by the 20 S proteasome of only one cell line, can be attributed to cell-dependent variation in proteasome composition.Fig. 4Digestion pattern of the histone 2A-(77–105) synthetic substrate by purified 20 S proteasome from C1R (A) or P815 (B) cells. The sequence of the HLA-B27 ligand is shaded. Thick, medium, and thin lines indicate peptide products recovered with >5%, 1–5%, and <1% yield of the total digest, respectively. Only peptides recovered with >0.1% yield are indicated. The IRNDEELNK peptide is indicated by a horizontal arrow.

https://openalex.org/W2002677614,"Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) comprises an α subunit and a β subunit, whereas the FSH receptor consists of two halves with distinct functions: the N-terminal extracellular exodomain and C-terminal membrane-associated endodomain. FSH initially binds to exodomain, and the resulting FSH/exodomain complex modulates the endodomain and generates signal. However, it has been difficult to determine which subunit of FSH contacts the exodomain or endodomain and in what orientation FSH interacts with them. To address these crucial issues, the receptor was Ala-scanned and the hormone subunits were probed with photoaffinity labeling with receptor peptides corresponding to the N-terminal region of the exodomain and exoloop 3 of the endodomain. Our results show that both regions of the receptors are important for hormone binding and signal generation. In addition, the FSH β subunit is specifically labeled with the N-terminal peptide, whereas the α subunit is labeled with the exoloop 3 peptide. These contrasting results show that the FSH β subunit is close to the N-terminal region and that the α subunit is projected toward exoloop 3 in the endodomain. The results raise the fundamental question whether the α subunit, common among the glycoprotein hormones, plays a major role in generating the hormone signal common to all glycoprotein hormones.

Both of the subunits are necessary for hormone action (1Jackson A.M. Berger P. Pixley M. Klein C. Hsueh A.J. Boime I. Mol.

The crystal structure of human FSH (3Fox K.M. Dias J.A. Van Roey P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 378-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) shows that the two subunits are tightly associated in a crescent with the C termini in the concave side and the N termini in the convex side (Fig. 1A). This is essentially the same as the human chorionic gonadotropin structure (4Lapthorn J.P. Harris D.C. Littlejohn A. Lustbader J.W. Canfield R.E. Machin K.J. Morgan F.J. Isaacs N.W.

An exception to this intermingled subunit structure is the two polarized tips of the crescent: the α tip consisting of the α loops 1 and 3 and the β tip of the β loops 1 and 3.In contrast to the tightly held hormone structure, the FSH receptor (FSHR), a G protein-coupled receptor, has two distinct domains as shown in Fig. 1B. The extracellular N-terminal exodomain comprises ∼350 amino acids, and the membrane-associated C-terminal endodomain with a similar number of amino acids consists of seven transmembrane helices, three exoloops, three cytoloops, and the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail (6Sprengel R.

FSH initially interacts with the exodomain, and the resulting FSH/exodomain complex modulates the endodomain to generate hormone signal. Important amino acids have been identified for the interaction of the hormone and receptor (23Dias J.A. Lindau-Shepard B. Hauer C. Auger I. Biol.

However, the orientation of FSH α and β in the ternary complex of the hormone, exodomain, and endodomain has been a major enigma and difficult to determine.The bulk of the exodomain comprises 8–9 Leu-rich repeats (LRR) (7McFarland K.

LRRs are thought to form a one-third of a doughnut structure (26Jiang X. Dreno M. Buckler D. Cheng S. Ythier A. Wu H. Hendrickson W. Tayar N.

However, it is unclear which subunit of FSH contacts the exodomain or endodomain and in what orientation FSH interacts with them, although the concave C-terminal side of FSH appears to interact with the receptor. For example, FSH may interact horizontally or vertically with LRRs (Fig. 1, C and D) and in two directions. These are crucial pieces of information for understanding the interactions among the hormone, exodomain, and endodomain and the mechanistics of signal generation. In addition, the information will facilitate the design of agonists and antagonists and development of new therapeutics. Because of the importance, the interactions of glycoprotein hormones with their receptors have been modeled (3Fox K.M. Dias J.A. Van Roey P. Mol.

Nature. 1995; 374: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). However, the evidence has been elusive.In a step to resolve this issue, we set out to distinguish the interactions of the FSH subunits with the N-terminal region of the exodomain and exoloop 3 in the endodomain. Our results show the interaction of FSHβ with the N-terminal region of the exodomain and the α tip of FSHα with exoloop 3 (Fig. 1E).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Human FSH was purchased from the National Hormone and Pituitary Program. Denatured FSH was prepared by boiling the hormone in 8 m urea for 30 min. Rabbit anti-FSHα serum, rabbit anti-FSHβ serum, and monoclonal anti-FSHR 106.105 antibody were kindly provided by Dr. James Dias. Anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with peroxidase was purchased from Pierce. Peptide mimics including wild type peptides corresponding to the Ser9-Lys40 sequence (FSHR9–40) and exoloop 3 and a photoactivable peptide containing benzoyl phenylalanine (Bpa) in place of Phe13 (FSHR9–40F13Bpa) were synthesized by Genemed Synthesis (San Francisco, CA) and purified on a Vydac C18 high pressure liquid chromatography column using solvent gradient from 100% of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water to 20% of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water and 80% 1-propanol.Mutagenesis and Functional Expression of FSH Receptors—Mutant FSHR cDNAs were prepared in the pSELECT vector using the Altered Sites mutagenesis system (Promega), sequenced on a Beckman CEQ 2000XL capillary sequencer, subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) as described previously (32Ji I. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20851-20854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and sequenced again to verify mutation sequences. This procedure does not involve polymerase chain reaction and therefore does not have its infidelity problems. Wild type and mutant receptor constructs were transfected into HEK 293 cells by the calcium phosphate method as described previously (32Ji I. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20851-20854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Stable cell lines were established in minimum essential medium containing 10% horse serum and 500 μg/ml G418. These cells were used for hormone-binding cAMP production. All of the assays were carried out in duplicate and repeated 4–5 times, and the means ± S.D. were calculated.125I-FSH Binding and Intracellular cAMP Assay—Stable cells were assayed for 125I-FSH binding in the presence of 100,000 cpm of 125I-FSH (33Ji I. Ji T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 5465-5469Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and increasing concentrations of unlabeled FSH. The Kd values were determined by Scatchard plots. For intracellular cAMP assay, cells were washed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated in the medium containing 0.1 μg/ml isobutylmethylxanthine for 15 min. Increasing concentrations of FSH were then added, and incubation was continued for 45 min at 37 °C. After removing the medium, the cells were rinsed once with fresh medium without isobutylmethylxanthine, lysed in 70% ethanol, freeze-thawed in liquid nitrogen, and scraped. After pelleting cell debris at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was collected, dried under vacuum, and resuspended in 10 μl of cAMP assay buffer (Amersham Biosciences). cAMP concentrations were determined with an 125I-cAMP assay kit (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's instructions and validated for use in our laboratory.125I-FSH Binding to Solubilized FSHR—Transfected cells were washed twice with ice-cold 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 (buffer A). Cells were scraped on ice, collected in buffer A containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mmN-ethylmaleimide, and 10 mm EDTA), and pelleted by centrifugation at 1300 × g for 10 min. Cells were resuspended in 0.6 ml of buffer A containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 20% glycerol, and the above protease inhibitors (buffer B), incubated on ice for 15 min, and diluted with 5.4 ml of buffer A containing 20% glycerol plus the protease inhibitors (buffer C). The mixture was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The supernatant (500 μl) was mixed with 100,000 cpm of 125I-FSH and 6.5 μl of 0.9% NaCl and 10 mm Na2HPO4 at pH 7.4 containing increasing concentrations of unlabeled FSH. After incubation for 12 h at 4 °C, the solution was thoroughly mixed with 250 μl of buffer A containing bovine γ-globulin (5 μg/ml) and 750 μl of buffer A containing 20% polyethylene glycol 8000. After incubation for 10 min at 4 °C, samples were pelleted at 1,300 × g for 30 min and supernatants removed. Pellets were resuspended in 1.5 ml of buffer A containing 20% polyethylene glycol 8000, centrifuged, and counted for radioactivity. Monoclonal anti-FSHR antibodies were radioiodinated and used for binding to nonbinding mutant FSHRs expressed on the intact cell surface as described previously (34Hong S. Phang T. Ji I. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13835-13840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).Derivatization and Radioiodination of Peptides—In the dark, 30 μg of receptor peptides in 40 μl of 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, was mixed with 1 mCi of Na-[125I]iodine in 10 μl of 0.1 m NaOH and 7 μl of chloramine-T (1 mg/ml) in 10 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.4. After 20 s, 7 μl of sodium metabisulfite (2.5 mg/ml) in 10 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.4, was introduced to terminate radioiodination. Radioiodinated peptides were mixed with 60 μl of 16% sucrose solution in PBS and fractionated on Sephadex Superfine G-10 column (0.6 × 15 cm) using PBS. Peptides were derivatized with 4-azidobenzoyl glycine (ABG) and radioiodinated as described previously (35Sohn J. Ryu K.S. Sievert G. Jeoung M. Ji I. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50165-50175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).Photoaffinity Labeling of FSH—The following solutions were sequentially introduced to siliconized glass tubes: 20 μl of 0.9% NaCl and 10 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.4, in PBS, 10 μl of FSH in PBS, and 10 μl of 125I-FSHR9–40F13Bpa in PBS. Competitive inhibition experiments were carried out as described for the photoaffinity-labeling experiments with the exception that 10 μl instead of 20 μl of PBS was introduced to each tube and the mixture was incubated with 10 μl of increasing concentrations of nonradioactive receptor peptides. The mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 90 min in the dark, irradiated with a Mineralight R-52 UV lamp for 3 min as described previously (36Ji I. Ji T.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 7167-7170Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and solubilized in 2% SDS, 100 mm dithiothreitol, and 8 m urea. The samples were electrophoresed on 8–12% polyacrylamide gradient gels. Gels were dried on filter paper and exposed to an imaging screen overnight, which was scanned on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics).Deglycosylation—The FSH α and β subunits co-migrate on SDS-PAGE. To separate them on the gel, FSH was photoaffinity-labeled and deglycosylated with PNGase F. Enzymatic cleavage was done by incubation of the labeled FSH complex with 20 or 50 units of PNGase F (New England BioLabs) in 40 μl for 18 h at 37 °C. The samples were solubilized in SDS under the reducing condition and electrophoresed on 15% gel containing 9 m urea.Immunoblot of FSH Subunits—Separated proteins were blotted onto 0.2-μm nitrocellulose membrane as described previously (37Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44707) Google Scholar). Membranes were treated for 1 h with 5% blocking buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, 1.4 m NaCl, 5% nonfat dry milk, 0.2% sodium azide, 1% Nonidet P-40, pH 7.4) and incubated with polyclonal anti-FSH and anti-FSH α and β antibodies (dilution 1:2000 and 1:3500 each in blocking buffer) for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were washed three times (5 min each) with the blocking buffer and incubated with anti-rabbit peroxidase-conjugated IgG (dilution 1:5000 in the blocking buffer) for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were washed three times (5 min each) with the blocking buffer and twice (5 min each) with 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Membranes were incubated in staining solution (0.05% 3,3′-diaminobenzidine, 0.02% CoCl2, 0.03% H2O2) until bands became visible.RESULTSActivities of the N-terminal Region—In a first step to check the importance of the N-terminal region of human FSHR, each amino acid of the 8SNRVFLCQESKVTEIPSDLPRNAIE33 sequence was individually substituted with Ala. This sequence is diverse among the glycoprotein hormone receptors (Fig. 2), although these receptors share a high overall homology and structural similarity (38Ji T.H. Grossmann M. Ji I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17299-17302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). In contrast, the FSHR sequence is highly conserved among species, implicating its importance. HEK 293 cells were stably transfected with mutant receptor plasmids and selected for stably expressing individual mutant receptors. These cells were assayed for 125I-FSH binding and FSH-dependent cAMP induction. The results show that some of the Ala substitutions significantly impacted the hormone binding and/or cAMP induction.Fig. 2Comparison of the primary sequence of the first 34 residues of the glycoprotein hormone receptors. The FSH receptor sequences of various species were compared with the corresponding sequences of the human LH receptor and TSH receptor. Cys15, Ser18, Pro24, Asp26, and Leu27 of FSHR are conserved among the species.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Ala substitutions for Ser9, Asn10, Arg11, Val12, Phe13, and Leu14 improved FSH binding (Fig. 3, A and B), FSH-dependent cAMP induction (Fig. 3C), or both. The Kd values of FSHRN10A, FSHRR11A, and FSHRL14A were lower than the wild type value as were the EC50 values of FSHRS9A, FSHRN10A, FSHRV12A, FSHRF13A, and FSHRL14A (see tables in Fig. 3). Ala substitutions for Gln16, Glu17, Lys19, and Val20 did not impact the EC50 values and maximal cAMP induction (Fig. 3F), and Kd values of the mutants were similar to or somewhat higher than the wild type value (Fig. 3, D and E). In contrast, the S18A substitution resulted in a considerably lower EC50 value despite a higher Kd value. These results show an improved cAMP induction despite a lower hormone binding affinity and suggest an interesting and potentially crucial role of Ser18 in modulating signal generation.Fig. 3Ala substitutions for Ser9-Val20.A–F, residues from Ser9 to Val20 of the FSH receptor were individually substituted with Ala, and the resulting mutant receptors were stably expressed in HEK 293 cells. Intact cells were used for 125I-FSH binding in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled FSH (A and D) and for cAMP production (C and F). The competitive inhibition data (A and D) were converted to Scatchard plot (B and E). Experiments were repeated 4–6 times in duplicate, and the means ± S.D. were calculated. NS, not significant.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Ala substitution for Thr21, Glu22, or Ser25 did not significantly impact hormone binding or cAMP induction (Fig. 4). On the other hand, the I23A substitution partially impaired the cAMP induction with a 23-fold higher EC50 value and 2.6-fold lower maximal cAMP level. The P24A, D26A, and L27A substitutions completely abrogated hormone binding and therefore cAMP induction, suggesting the importance of these residues and this region. The P28A, R29A, N30A, A31G, I32A, and E33A substitutions did not dramatically impact the Kd and EC50 values or the maximal cAMP production (Fig. 4). The nonbinding mutants were either incapable of binding the hormone or trapped in cells, and these possibilities have successfully been tested by assaying hormone binding after solubilization of cells in nonionic detergents (34Hong S.

The binding assay for receptors solubilized in Nonidet P-40 showed that FSH did not bind to any of the C15A, P24A, D26A, and L27A mutants (Fig. 5A), indicating that they are incapable of hormone binding. However, the result does not necessarily prove the surface expression of the nonbinding mutants and nonbinding on the surface. Therefore, the cells expressing them were probed with 125I-anti-FSHR antibody. The antibody bound to the cells (Fig. 5B), indicating the surface expression of the mutants and their inability to bind the hormone on the cell surface. These results, taken together, show several distinct effects of Ala substitutions as shown in the summary bar graph (Fig. 6). C15A, P24A, D26A, and L27A abolished hormone binding. In contrast to these nonbinding mutations, N10A, R11A, and L14A improved hormone binding. On the other hand, I23A impaired cAMP induction by dramatically increasing the EC50 value. Remarkably, S9A, V12A, F13A, S18A, and I32A reduced the EC50 value by 2–3-fold while maintaining or slightly enhancing the maximum cAMP induction level. These results suggested the importance of this region of the receptor in hormone binding and cAMP induction and raised a question as to whether this region directly interacts with the hormone or indirectly impacts the global structure of the receptor.Fig. 4Ala substitutions for Thr21-Glu33.A–F, residues from Thr21 to Glu33 of the FSH receptor were individually substituted with Ala, and the resulting mutant receptors were expressed in HEK 293 cells and assayed as described in the legend to Fig. 3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 5Hormone binding in solution and anti-FSHR antibody binding to intact cells.A, cells individually transfected with the C15A, P24A, D26A, or L27A mutant receptor were solubilized in Nonidet P-40 and assayed for 125I-FSH binding as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, intact cells were also probed with 125I-labeled monoclonal anti-FSHR 106.105 antibody for the surface expression of the nonbinding mutants.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 6Comparison of Ala substitution mutations.

A Tyr residue was attached to the N terminus for radioiodination, and the N terminus was acetylated while the C terminus amidated. Phe13 was substituted with Bpa for photoaffinity labeling (41Kauer J.C. Erickson-Viitanen S. Wolfe Jr., H.R. DeGrado W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10695-10700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ketone moiety of the Bpa group can be activated with UV at >350 nm and is capable of reacting with unreactive α-CH bonds of amino acids (41Kauer J.C. Erickson-Viitanen S. Wolfe Jr., H.R.

To determine whether the resulting peptide 125I-FSHR9–40F13Bpa could bind and photoaffinity-label FSH, it was incubated with FSH and irradiated with UV for increasing time periods. Samples were solubilized in SDS under reducing conditions and then electrophoresed. The autoradiographic phosphorimage of the gel (Fig. 7B) revealed labeling of the FSH band. The autoradiograph suggests that the two subunits of human FSH comigrated. The band was not labeled when the sample was not irradiated with UV, indicating the requirement for UV irradiation. The extent of the labeling was dependent on the irradiation time, reaching maximum labeling after 30-s irradiation. The result shows that the labeling is saturable. The hormone was labeled next with increasing concentrations of 125I-FSHR9–40F13Bpa while maintaining FSH at a constant concentration (Fig. 7C). Conversely, increasing concentrations of FSH were labeled with a constant concentration of 125I-FSHR9–40F13Bpa (Fig. 7D). If the labeling was specific, the concentrations should reach a plateau under both conditions. Indeed, the labeling plateaued under both conditions, indicating saturable and specific labeling of a substantial portion (>50%) of FSH. Furthermore, the labeling should be inhibited by nonradioactive peptide and unmodified wild type peptide. Therefore, FSH was incubated with 125I-FSHR9–40F13Bpa in the presence of increasing concentrations of wild type peptide and nonradioactive FSHR9–40F13Bpa (Fig. 7E). The peptides inhibited the photoaffinity labeling in a dose-dependent manner and eventually blocked the labeling. Peptides corresponding to exoloops 1–3, FSHRexo1, FSHRexo2, and FSHRexo3, were also tested. FSHRexo2 inhibited the labeling as FSHR9–40 did. In contrast, FSHRexo1 inhibited the labeling with a ∼30-fold less potency. On the other hand, FSHRexo3 failed to block the labeling.Fig. 7Photoaffinity labeling of FSH with photoactivable FSHR9–40F13Bpa. The FSH receptor peptide corresponding to the sequence Ser9-Lys40 (FSHR9–40) was synthesized with a Tyr at the N terminus for radioiodination and Bpa at the position of Phe13 for photoaffinity labeling (A).

Homogeneously damaged oligonucleotides, which contained a single cis-syn cyclobutane thymine dimer (CTD) at one of six different sites in the internal control region (ICR) of the 5 S rRNA gene to generate a series of damaged DNA substrates, were prepared by chemical synthesis. Binding of TFIIIA to the substrates was assayed by measurement of dissociation constants (Kd), dissociation rates (k off), and protein-DNA contacts. The results indicated that a single CTD in the ICR does not significantly affect the Kd of TFIIIA. In contrast, CTDs at positions +55 and +72 (from the transcription start site) in the ICR markedly enhanced k off of TFIIIA from the complex. In addition, CTDs in these two sites increased methylation of the N7 of guanines (by dimethyl sulfate) in the zinc finger contacts of the ICR-TFIIIA complex. Furthermore CTDs at +55 and +72 were more efficiently removed from the complex than CTDs at other sites in the ICR by Xenopus oocyte nuclear extracts. This suggests that repair of CTDs closely correlates with changes in the binding of individual zinc fingers of the ICR-TFIIIA complex. These results have implications for the mechanism of DNA damage recognition and repair in protein-DNA complexes.

These results have implications for the mechanism of DNA damage recognition and repair in protein-DNA complexes. Ultraviolet radiation can induce a variety of negative biological effects in cells including necrosis, apoptosis, mutagenesis, and carcinogenesis. These diverse effects result from the generation of stable UV photoproducts, such as cis-syn cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) 1The abbreviations used are: CPD, cis-syn cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer; TF, transcription factor; zf, zinc finger; 5 S rDNA, 5 S ribosomal RNA gene; ICR, internal control region; IE, intermediate element; CTD, cis-syn cyclobutane thymine dimer; pyrimidine-pyrimidone (6-4), 6-(1,2)-dihydro-2-oxo-4-pyrimidinyl-5-methyl-2,4-(1H,3H)-pyrimidinediones; NER, nucleotide excision repair; dmg_, damaged substrate; RNAP, RNA polymerase; DMS, dimethyl sulfate; endo, endonuclease.1The abbreviations used are: CPD, cis-syn cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer; TF, transcription factor; zf, zinc finger; 5 S rDNA, 5 S ribosomal RNA gene; ICR, internal control region; IE, intermediate element; CTD, cis-syn cyclobutane thymine dimer; pyrimidine-pyrimidone (6-4), 6-(1,2)-dihydro-2-oxo-4-pyrimidinyl-5-methyl-2,4-(1H,3H)-pyrimidinediones; NER, nucleotide excision repair; dmg_, damaged substrate; RNAP, RNA polymerase; DMS, dimethyl sulfate; endo, endonuclease. and pyrimidine-pyrimidone (6-4) dimers, which contain covalent bonds connecting two adjacent pyrimidines (1Patrick M.H.

These lesions disrupt base stacking in the DNA helix and weaken interactions between base pairs, significantly altering the local structure of the DNA helix (3Kim J.K. Patel D. Choi B.S. Photochem.

Jasper N.G. Hoeijmakers J.H. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 768-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). NER targets a broad spectrum of bulky lesions, which distort the DNA helix and modify DNA chemistry (10Hess M.T. Schwitter U. Petretta M. Giese B. Naegeli H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6664-6669Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Bulky lesions occurring throughout the genome are repaired by global genome repair. The process is initiated by specific binding of damage recognition proteins to the lesions. In the case of pyrimidine-pyrimidone (6-4) dimers and cisplatin adducts, the XPC-HR23B complex is believed to be the recognition proteins (9de Laat W.L. Jasper N.G. Hoeijmakers J.H. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 768-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). In contrast, damaged DNA-binding protein has been proposed to act as a recognition factor for CPDs prior to the binding of the XPC-HR23B complex (11Tang J. Chu G. DNA Repair. 2002; 1: 601-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 12Wakasugi M. Kawashima A. Morioka H. Linn S. Sancar A. Mori T. Nikaido O. Matsunaga T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1637-1640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar).Several factors are known to influence repair of UV photoproducts. First, the degree of helical distortion induced by a lesion may be related to its repair rate, suggesting that recognition of damage is a rate-limiting step for NER (13Batty D.P. Wood R.D. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 241: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). In addition, the position of a lesion is one of the determinants of repair rates. Efficient repair in the transcribed strand of an active gene, called transcription-coupled repair, has been found in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells (14Mellon I. Hanawalt P.C. Nature. 1989; 342: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 15Mellon I. Spivak G. Hanawalt P.C.

A. 2002; 99: 649-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). It has been postulated that transcription-coupled repair is initiated by a stalled RNA polymerase and requires transcription-repair coupling factor in Escherichia coli or CSA, CSB, TFIIH, and XPG in mammalian cells (17Selby C.P. Sancar A. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 317-329Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Svejstrup J.Q. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). In contrast to preferential repair of the transcribed region, low NER rates have been observed at upstream promoter sites in human JUN, CDC2, and PGK genes (19Tu Y. Tornaletti S. Pfeifer G.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 675-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 20Tommasi S. Oxyzoglou A.B. Pfeifer G.P.

Since the slow repair regions correspond to transcription factor binding sites, it has been suggested that the assembly of transcription factors around the promoters inhibits NER by shielding lesions from the NER machinery. Furthermore inhibition of NER by a transcription factor has been demonstrated with the TFIIIA-5 S rDNA complex in vitro where CPD removal is markedly decreased by TFIIIA binding (22Conconi A. Liu X. Koriazova L. Ackerman E.J. Smerdon M.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1387-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar).Xenopus TFIIIA is a prototype for zinc finger proteins, consisting of nine tandemly repeated C2H2-type zinc fingers and a C-terminal domain. High affinity binding (Kd = 0.4–2 nm) of TFIIIA for the ICR of 5 S rDNA results from the sequence-specific interactions between the nine fingers and three separate promoter regions in the ICR (Fig. 1): the A-box (+50 to +64), intermediate element (IE, +67 to +72), and C-box (+82 to +92) (23Clemens K.R.

The first three zinc fingers (zf1–zf3) and the last three (zf7–zf9) make contacts with bases in the major groove of the C-box and A-box, respectively, and zf5 interacts with bases in the IE. The three segments are connected by zf4 and zf6 crossing the minor groove (25Nolte R.T. Conlin R.M. Harrison S.C. Brown R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2938-2943Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar).Inhibition of UV photoproducts by TFIIIA binding to 5 S rDNA is observed using UV-irradiated DNA fragments as a binding substrate (6Liu X. Conconi A. Smerdon M.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13710-13717Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, since UV irradiation of homogenous DNA fragments produces a mixed population of fragments with various photoproducts at different positions and different yields, it has remained unresolved which CPD sites in the 5 S rDNA may reduce the DNA binding affinity of TFIIIA. Moreover analysis of in vitro repair of UV-irradiated DNA in the TFIIIA-DNA complex has similar limitations due to the heterogeneity of the DNA substrates.To overcome these limitations, DNA fragments containing CTDs at specific positions in 5 S rDNA were prepared from chemically synthesized DNA oligonucleotides (Fig. 2A). The results of TFIIIA binding demonstrate that a single CTD in the ICR only slightly modulates the DNA binding affinity of TFIIIA, depending on the position of the CTD. However, CTDs at positions +55 and +72 in the ICR noticeably enhanced dissociation of the TFIIIA-DNA complex and modulated the TFIIIA contacts around the CTD sites. Furthermore in vitro repair of these substrates showed that NER was more efficient at the two sites (+55 and +72) where significant increases in off-rates occurred. Conversely TFIIIA binding inhibited repair of CTDs in the ICR where no significant change in binding occurred. Therefore, these results suggest that modulation of TFIIIA binding by CTDs leads to the heterogeneity of repair rates in the ICR.Fig. 2Location of CTDs in 5 S rDNA substrates.

Reactions were stopped with 20 μl of 98% formamide loading buffer, and the samples were heated to 90 °C. The resulting DNA fragments were resolved on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel (8 m urea, 10% polyacrylamide, TBE buffer).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)MATERIALS AND METHODSConstruction of 5 S rDNA Oligonucleotides Containing CTDs at Specific Sites—Oligonucleotides were synthesized on an ABI 380B automated DNA synthesizer using phosphoramidite chemistry. The 5′-dimethoxytrityl CTD phosphoramidites were synthesized and incorporated into specific sites (Fig. 2A) during synthesis as described previously (26Kosmoski J.V. Smerdon M.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9485-9494Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). After synthesis and high pressure liquid chromatography purification, the final single strand oligonucleotides were dissolved in TE buffer (10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5) and quantified by UV absorbance at 260 nm.Double-stranded DNA fragments were prepared by mixing the complementary sequences in equal molar ratio and slow cooling from 90 °C to 4 °C. The annealed fragments were separated from single-stranded oligonucleotides on 10% polyacrylamide native gels in TBE buffer (90 mm Tris base, 90 mm borate, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.3). The double-stranded DNA band was identified by exposing the wet gel to long wavelength UV (365 nm) on a PhosphorImager screen (Amersham Biosciences) and locating the band by its “shadow” in the phosphorimage (27Kosmoski J.V. Designer Nucleosomes for DNA Repair. Ph.D. thesis, Washington State University, Pullman, WA1999Google Scholar). DNA was extracted from the gel by elution in TE buffer at 37 °C for 8 h. The solution was filtered with a 0.45-μm centrifuge filter to remove the gel particles, and the DNA was precipitated with ethanol. For strand-specific 5′-end labeling, the appropriate single strand oligonucleotide was phosphorylated with T4 kinase (Invitrogen) and [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The labeled strand was annealed to its complementary sequence as described above.Construction of 5 S rDNA Substrates for NER Containing CTDs at Specific Sites—The 125-bp (or 101-bp) 5 S rDNA substrates used in this study were prepared by ligation of 67-mer double-stranded fragments to adjacent sequences. Briefly single strand oligonucleotides were synthesized, purified, and phosphorylated with [γ-P32]ATP, as described above, to label the 5′-end of the damaged strand. When a 5′-phosphate was required for ligation, the appropriate 5′-end was phosphorylated with unlabeled ATP. Then oligonucleotides were annealed to their complementary sequences to generate 5- or 6-base overhangs on the 3′-end. The resulting DNA fragments with +38 to +104 of 5 S rDNA were ligated to the sequence of –20 to +37 to produce a 125-bp (–21 to +104) DNA fragment with CTDs at +50 (dmg_A1) or +55 (dmg_A2). Similarly a 101-bp (+38 to +144) 5 S rDNA fragment with CTDs at +88 (dmg_C2), +90 (dmg_C3), and +101 (dmg_OC) were prepared by ligation of the 67-bp damaged fragment to the sequence of +105 to +144. Standard ligation reactions were carried out using 1 unit of T4 DNA ligase (Invitrogen) in 25 μl of reaction buffer at 22 °C for 1 h. The ligated products were isolated on a 7 m urea, 8% polyacrylamide gel and used for in vitro repair experiments.Preparation of Recombinant TFIIIA—Recombinant Xenopus laevis TFIIIA was expressed and purified from E. coli BL21(DE3) containing plasmid pTA-102 as described by Del Rio and Setzer (28Del Rio S. Setzer D.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6197-6203Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Briefly TFIIIA expression was induced with 1 mm of isopropylthio-β-d-galactoside and 100 μm ZnSO4. After cell lysis, the inclusion body of TFIIIA was suspended in buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μm ZnSO4, 10% glycerol) with 250 mm NaCl, 5 m urea, and 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and the mixture was stirred at 4 °C for 24 h to dissolve TFIIIA. The solution was mixed with buffer A, saturated with (NH4)2SO4, to obtain a soluble fraction in 40–80% (NH4)2SO4. TFIIIA was purified on a BioRex70 column (Bio-Rad) and eluted with high salt buffer (buffer A, 1 m NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride). Final purification was carried out using a phenyl Superose column (Amersham Biosciences) and a 100-ml gradient from 1.2 to 0.5 m (NH4)2SO4. Protein concentration was measured using the Bradford method (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213426) Google Scholar), and the purified TFIIIA solution (about 500 nm) was stored at –70 °C. The stock solution was diluted to an appropriate concentration with TFIIIA binding buffer (see below) before use.Measurement of Dissociation Constants (Kd) of TFIIIA-5 S rDNA Complexes—The 67-bp DNA substrates were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 kinase as described above. The labeled DNA fragments were incubated with TFIIIA in 20 μl of TFIIIA binding buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 7 mm MgCl2, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 70 mm KCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml poly(dI·dC), and 10 μm ZnCl2) at room temperature for 1 h (28Del Rio S. Setzer D.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6197-6203Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The TFIIIA and DNA substrates were incubated at varying concentrations as indicated in each figure. The binding mixtures were loaded onto native gels (10% polyacrylamide, 25 mm Tris base, 200 mm glycine, 5% glycerol) and run in 25 mm Tris base, 200 mm glycine buffer at 10 V/cm for about 2 h to obtain sufficient separation of free and bound DNA. Subsequently the gels were vacuum-dried and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen, and each lane was scanned on a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences, Model 445-P90). Intensities of DNA bands were quantified by integration of peak intensities using ImageQuant NT (Amersham Biosciences) and PeakFit 4.0 (SPSS Inc.) as described in Li et al. (30Li S. Waters R. Smerdon M.J. Methods. 2000; 22: 170-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Bound and free DNA concentrations were calculated from the intensities and total concentration of DNA ausing the following equations, [boundDNA]=IboundIbound+Ifree×[totalDNA](Eq. 1) [freeDNA]=IfreeIbound+Ifree×[totalDNA](Eq. 2) where I bound and I free are the intensities of the integrated bound and free DNA, respectively. The ratio of bound and free DNA versus the concentration of bound DNA was plotted and fit to a least-squares linear regression to obtain a Kd value using the following equation (31Clemens K.R.

After incubation, the mixture was divided into eight aliquots of 9 μl, and the dissociation reaction was initiated by addition of unlabeled competitor (67-bp undamaged 5 S rDNA) to the aliquots. (The times of addition of competitor were adjusted such that samples having the desired incubation times could be loaded simultaneously onto the gel.) The mixtures containing competitor and TFIIIA-DNA complex were incubated at 22 °C for various times (0, 7.5, 15, 22.5, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min) and loaded onto 10% native polyacrylamide gels to separate bound and free DNA. The bound and free DNA concentrations were quantified as described above, and dissociation time courses were obtained by plotting [bound] t /[bound]0 as a function of incubation time. (The ratio of [bound] t /[bound]0 was calculated from the fractional intensities of bound DNA at times t and 0, respectively.) To calculate k off and half-lives (t ½), the natural log of [bound] t /[bound]0 versus time was plotted and fit to a linear regression. The k off and t ½ values were determined from the following equations (31Clemens K.R. Zhang P. Liao X. McBryant S.J. Wright P.E. Gottesfeld J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 23-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). ln[bound]t[bound]0=-koff×t(Eq. 5) t12=ln2koff(Eq. 6) Methylation Protection in TFIIA-5 S rDNA Complexes—End-labeled 67-bp DNA substrates (0.3 pmol) were incubated with about 1.5 pmol of TFIIIA in 50 μl of TFIIIA binding buffer. Then 1 μl of 8% dimethyl sulfate (DMS) in ethanol was added to the free DNA or complex solution and incubated at room temperature for 2 min. The samples were loaded onto 8% native polyacrylamide gels and run until bound and free DNA were well separated. The DNA was recovered from the gel by elution in 400 μl of TE buffer at 50–60 °C for 5 h followed by extraction using a QIAEX kit (Qiagen). The DNA samples were dried and redissolved in 70 μl of 10% piperidine and incubated at 90 °C for 30 min to depurinate and cleave the phosphate backbone at methylated G residues. Each sample was dried and washed two times with 20 μl of H2O. The cleaved DNA fragments were resolved on denaturing gels (20 × 60 cm) containing 7 m urea, 12% polyacrylamide, and TBE buffer for 2 h at 60 watts. After electrophoresis, the gels were dried and exposed to Phosphor-Imager screens to visualize DNA bands as described above.NER of CTDs in TFIIIA-DNA Complexes—For NER of CTDs, TFIIIA-DNA complexes were formed in 70 μl of TFIIIA binding buffer with 0.35 pmol of DNA and about 1.75 pmol of TFIIIA supplemented with 7.7 μg of poly(dI·dC). This high concentration of poly(dI·dC) was required to suppress nuclease activity in the Xenopus oocyte nuclear extracts (22Conconi A. Liu X. Koriazova L. Ackerman E.J. Smerdon M.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1387-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Prior to addition of repair buffer, the complexes were identified by native gel electrophoresis. The samples were mixed with an equal volume of repair buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 3 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25 mm dNTP, 70 mm KCl, 7 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 1% polyvinylpyrrolidone) to a final volume of 130 μl, and the repair reaction was initiated by addition of 7 μl of Xenopus oocyte nuclear extracts at room temperature (32Oda N. Saxena J.K. Jenkins T.M. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Ackerman E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13816-13820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). At various times, 24-μl aliquots of the mixture were extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1). Samples were ethanol-precipitated and redissolved in 9 μl of T4 endo V digestion buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 10 mm EDTA). About 8 ng of T4 endo V (provided by Dr. R. S. Lloyd, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX) was added to the solution and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. After the reactions, 10 μl of gel loading buffer (98% formamide, 10 mm EDTA) was added to the solution and heated to 90 °C for 2 min. The resulting DNA fragments were separated on a denaturing gel (7 m urea, 10% polyacrylamide, 1× TBE) for about 1 h at 15 V/cm. The intensities of resolved bands on a denaturing gel were quantified using ImageQuant and PeakFit 4.0 software (30Li S. Waters R. Smerdon M.J. Methods. 2000; 22: 170-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The percentage of CTDs remaining was determined at varying times using the equation 100 × Ft /F 0, where Ft and F 0 are fractional intensities in the CTD band at times t and 0, respectively.RESULTSConstruction of 5 S rDNA Substrates Containing CTDs at Specific Sites—As illustrated in Fig. 2A, DNA substrates were designed to contain CTDs in the A-box (dmg_A1 and dmg_A2), IE (dmg_IE), and C-box (dmg_C2 and dmg_C3) and outside of the ICR (dmg_OC). Since synthesis of CC, TC, or CT cyclobutane dimer phosphoramidites has not been established in our laboratory, a C→ T mutation was required for insertion of CTDs in the C-box. Therefore, cytosines at +87 (dmg_C2) and +89 (dmg_C3) were chosen as mutation sites, and the mutated sequences were used as controls (Fig. 2A).The location of CTDs in the DNA substrates was verified by T4 endo V digestion, which produces a single strand break at CPD sites (33McCullough A.K. Dodson M.L. Lloyd R.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 255-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2B, about 80% of the DNA substrates contained a CTD at the designed position (i.e. are cut by T4 endo V). Impurities, represented as uncut bands on T4 endo V (+) lanes, result, in part, from a reverse reaction of CTDs and/or chemical modification of the CTD during oligonucleotide synthesis as described by Kosmoski and Smerdon (26Kosmoski J.V. Smerdon M.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9485-9494Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 27Kosmoski J.V. Designer Nucleosomes for DNA Repair. Ph.D. thesis, Washington State University, Pullman, WA1999Google Scholar).Binding Affinity of TFIIIA to the ICR Containing a Single CTD—The Kd values of TFIIIA-DNA complexes were obtained by titration of a fixed amount of TFIIIA with increasing amounts of 67-bp DNA substrates followed by gel mobility shift assays. Variation in DNA concentration was used since, compared with protein titration, concentrations of DNA are more accurately estimated, and the variation of Kd values was reduced. Representative gels and Scatchard plots are shown in Fig. 3. Consistent with the report by Clemens et al. (31Clemens K.R. Zhang P. Liao X. McBryant S.J. Wright P.E. Gottesfeld J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 23-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), the undamaged ICR fragment has a Kd of 2.1 nm. On the other hand, the mutated control sequences (control C2, +87C→ T; control C3, +89C→ T) had a 2-fold lower affinity for TFIIIA with a Kd of 4 nm (Table I), values similar to those obtained by Pieler et al. (34Pieler T. Hamm J. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1987; 48: 91-100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and Veldhoen et al. (35Veldhoen N. You Q. Setzer D.R. Romaniuk P.J.

Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and Scatchard analysis of TFIIIA binding to undamaged DNA (A) and dmg_A2 DNA (B) are shown. Binding reactions were performed with ∼8 nm TFIIIA and increasing amounts of labeled DNA. Bound and free DNA were separated on native gels and quantified as described under “Materials and Methods” to measure the concentration of bound and free DNA. The ratio of [bound DNA] to [free DNA] was plotted versus [bound DNA], and Kd values were calculated from the inverse slope of the straight lines.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IDissociation constants and free energies of TFIIIA-5 S rDNA complexesKdN aNumber of independent experiments.

Open table in a new tab As shown in Table I, a CTD at +50 (number corresponds to the 5′-side of the CTD in 5 S rDNA) in dmg_A1 had no significant effect on the binding affinity of TFIIIA (Kd = 2.3 nm). Footprinting and mutation studies indicate that +49T+50T is located on the edge of the TFIIIA binding region (24Hayes J.J. Tullius T.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 407-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 34Pieler T. Hamm J. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1987; 48: 91-100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Hence TFIIIA may tolerate the conformational change in DNA induced by a CTD at +50, and the binding affinity is not significantly changed. Similarly, as expected, a CTD at +101 (dmg_OC) had no influence on TFIIIA binding. On the contrary, a CTD at +55 (dmg_A2) or +72 (dmg_IE) increased the Kd value about 2-fold (Kd ≈ 3.8–4 nm). This small change in Kd yields a difference in ΔG 0 between the undamaged DNA and damaged DNA fragments of about +0.3 kcal/mol (Table I). Furthermore, in contrast to the CTDs in the A-box, a CTD at +88 (dmg_C2) enhanced binding affinity about 2-fold (Kd = 1.9 nm, ΔΔG 0 = –0.5 kcal/mol) compared with the undamaged DNA control (Kd = 4."
https://openalex.org/W2169124912,"The homotetrameric structure of the ryanodine-sensitive intracellular calcium (Ca2+) release channel (ryanodine receptor (RyR)) suggests that the four RyR subunits either combine to form a single pore or that each RyR subunit is an independently conducting pathway. Previously we showed that methanethiosulfonate ethylammonium (MTSEA+) covalently modifies the RyR to reduce current amplitudes in a time-dependent and stepwise manner. To ascertain the number of functionally conducting pores in the RyR, two approaches were combined: modification of the receptor by MTSEA+ and the use of different sized current carriers. Previous reports (Tinker, A., and Williams, A. J. (1993) J. Gen. Physiol. 102, 1107–1129) have shown that the organic cations methylamine, dimethylamine, ethylamine, and trimethylamine are permeant through the RyR but with reduced current amplitude depending upon the diameter of the respective amine. Experiments using the thiol reagent MTSEA+ to modify the channel protein showed that the current amplitudes decrease in steps leading to complete block of the channel when cesium (Cs+) is the current carrier. MTSEA+ modification decreased the number of channel substates as the diameter of the current carrier increased. Comparison of the degree of inhibition of MTSEA+-modified currents allows for differentiation between the two models for channel architecture.

These results demonstrate that the conduction pathway for the RyR is comprised of a single central pore. The ryanodine receptor (RyR) 1The abbreviations used are: RyR, ryanodine receptor; MTSEA+, methanethiosulfonate ethylammonium.1The abbreviations used are: RyR, ryanodine receptor; MTSEA+, methanethiosulfonate ethylammonium. is an intracellular calcium (Ca2+) release channel found in the endoplasmic reticulum of numerous cell types and is especially concentrated in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of striated muscle. These channels play crucial roles in Ca2+-mediated signaling pathways leading to T-lymphocyte activation, fertilization, excitation-contraction coupling, and many other cellular functions (2Marks A.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: H597-H605Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The RyR channel is a multimeric structure comprised of four identical subunits assumed to contribute directly to currents through the RyR (3Lai F.A. Erickson H.P. Rousseau E. Liu Q.-Y. Meissner G. Nature. 1988; 331: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 4Smith J.S. Imagawa T. Ma J. Fill M. Campbell K.P. Coronado R. J. Gen. Physiol. 1988; 92: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). It is unknown how the individual subunits fold in cellular membranes to form the pore(s) of the channel nor is it known how many pores are contained within a RyR. Two simple possibilities exist. One possibility is that the four identical subunits come together to form a single pore that is divided into quadrants, and the pore is influenced by the conformation of each subunit. The second possibility is that each subunit forms an independent pore that contributes one-fourth of the unitary current of the channel (5Quinn K.Q. Ehrlich B.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Previous efforts to elucidate the structure of the RyR pore have produced conflicting results. Using single channel analysis of the RyR, four subconductance states have been observed where each state represents one-quarter of the full conductance of the channel (4Smith J.S. Imagawa T. Ma J. Fill M. Campbell K.P. Coronado R. J. Gen. Physiol. 1988; 92: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The equal spacing of the substates suggests that the receptor is comprised of four distinct pores. The functional association between FK-506-binding protein and the RyR also supports the suggestion that the channel complex consists of multiple pores. The dissociation of FK-506-binding protein from the RyR after the addition of the immunosuppressant agents FK-506 or rapamycin leads to the occurrence of subconductance states that have been interpreted as ion flow through individual uncoordinated RyR monomers (6Kaftan E. Marks A.R. Ehrlich B.E. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 990-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 7Brillantes A.B. Ondrias K. Scott A. Kobrinsky E. Ondriasova E. Moschella M.C. Jayaraman T. Landers M. Ehrlich B.E. Marks A.R. Cell. 1994; 77: 513-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar, 8Williams A.J. West D.J. Sitsapesan R. Q. Rev. Biophys. 2001; 34: 61-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Evidence further supporting the four-pore theory comes from three-dimensional image reconstructions of the RyR (9Wagenknecht T. Grassucci R. Frank J. Saito A. Inui M. Fleischer S. Nature. 1989; 338: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). These studies routinely show four small radial openings, which branch out from a common origin. However, some views also show a large central opening, which makes interpretation of these studies complex. In contrast, there are also a number of studies that support a one-pore model. Only one cationic binding site was measured in the RyR (10Tinker A. Williams A.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 479-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), suggesting a single permeation pathway. Although an equal distribution of subconductance states has been used to support a four-pore model, a theoretical analysis demonstrating that single pore channels can also exhibit subconductance states of equal steps lends support to the single pore theory (11Dani J.A. Fox J.A. J. Theor. Biol. 1991; 153: 401-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Additional theoretical bases for favoring a single pore model derive from the calculation that each subunit would need a pore large enough to pass cations measuring up to 0.6 nm in diameter (10Tinker A. Williams A.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 479-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), a pore size difficult to create from the limited number of transmembrane helixes present in a single subunit (5Quinn K.Q. Ehrlich B.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Further support for the single pore model of the RyR tetramer comes from co-expression of a modified RyR construct designed to produce a low conductance channel with the wild type RyR. The expressed heteromeric proteins produced channel currents that could be separated into six groups where the unitary conductance ranged from wild type to that of the homomeric mutant (8Williams A.J. West D.J. Sitsapesan R. Q. Rev. Biophys. 2001; 34: 61-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The six conductance groups were then correlated with six possible arrangements of mutant and wild type RyR subunits. The conclusion from this study was that the conduction pathway was a single pore created by an equal contribution from each subunit (12Zhao M. Li P. Li X. Zhang L. Winkfein R.J. Chen S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25971-25974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Finally images using negative stain electron microscopy showed that the RyR complex exists as a four-subunit structure encircling a central “hole” (3Lai F.A. Erickson H.P. Rousseau E. Liu Q.-Y. Meissner G. Nature. 1988; 331: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Similarly a three-dimensional model of the RyR, generated at a resolution of 25 Å using electron microscopy and single particle reconstitution methods, reveals a central pore in the transmembrane region of the RyR homotetramer but multiple openings in the cytoplasmic domain (13Orlova E.V. Serysheva I.I. van Heel M. Hamilton S.L. Chiu W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 547-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Unfortunately the resolution is not sufficient to resolve the question of pore architecture. To functionally determine the pore architecture of the RyR we combined two approaches: modification of the receptor by MTSEA+ and the use of different sized current carriers. The current carriers used were cesium (Cs+) and the monovalent organic cations methylamine, dimethylamine, ethylamine, and trimethylamine. Organic amines have been shown to permeate through the RyR at rates that correspond to the size of the ion (1Tinker A. Williams A.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1993; 102: 1107-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and the relative permeability of the tested cation was inversely proportional to the diameter of the respective species. Cations with a diameter larger than 6.8 Å were impermeant (1Tinker A. Williams A.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1993; 102: 1107-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). MTSEA+ has been shown to covalently modify cysteine residues located in the pore region of ion channels and has been utilized in the study of the conduction pathway of a number of channel types (14Xu M. Akabas M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21505-21508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Kurz L.L. Zuhlke R.D. Zang H.J. Joho R.H. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 900-905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 16Akabas M.H. Stauffer D.A. Xu M. Karlin A. Science. 1992; 258: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar, 17Liu J. Siegelbaum S.A. Neuron. 2000; 28: 899-909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). MTSEA+ has also been shown to decrease Ba2+-mediated RyR currents in four incremental steps where the first modification occurred quickly with subsequent steps occurring with increasing duration of exposure to MTSEA+ (5Quinn K.Q. Ehrlich B.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). These results, coupled with the observation that MTSEA+ was only effective when the channel was open, were used to indicate that MTSEA+ modification occurred on four sites within the conduction pathway. We proposed that the size exclusion properties of the amines coupled with the stepwise decrease in RyR channel conductance induced by MTSEA+ could be used to uniquely determine the configuration of the RyR pore. Our results indicate that MTSEA+ decreases membrane currents in a stepwise manner in the presence of Cs+, methylamine, dimethylamine, ethylamine, and trimethylamine. The relative conductance of these amines is inversely proportional to the ionic diameter. More importantly, the number of subconductance levels observed in the MTSEA+-modified channels decreases as the diameter of the permeating ion increases, suggesting that a constriction in the pore has become too small to pass the larger cations. These results could only occur if the RyR channel consists of a single conducting pore. Materials—The methanethiosulfonate compound MTSEA+ was obtained from Toronto Research Chemicals Inc. (Ontario, Canada). The cationic amines methylamine, dimethylamine, ethylamine, and trimethylamine were purchased from Sigma. All other chemicals were acquired from standard commercial sources. Preparation of Sarcoplasmic Reticulum Membrane Vesicles—Cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles were isolated from dog heart according to the method of Feher (18Feher J.J. Davis M.D. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1991; 23: 249-258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) with a few modifications. Ventricles were isolated (10–15 g) and washed in ice-cold homogenization buffer (1 m KCl, 10 mm imidazole, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.2), blotted with absorbent paper, weighed, and minced. Tissues were homogenized in 5 volumes of ice-cold homogenization buffer using a Polytron (Brinkmann Instruments) in two steps. (a) The homogenate from a soft tissue grind, on ice, of three 10-s pulses at 20,000 rpm was centrifuged for 20 min at 10,000 × g max at 4 °C, and the supernatant was discarded. (b) The pellet was resuspended in ice-cold homogenization buffer to its original volume and rehomogenized in a hard tissue grind, on ice, of five 15–20-s pulses at 20,000 rpm. The resulting homogenate was centrifuged at 6,000 × g max for 20 min. The supernatant was collected and further centrifuged at 24,000 × g max for 25 min, and the pellet was discarded. The supernatant was Dounced, layered on a discontinuous sucrose gradient (two layers of 19 and 34% sucrose), and centrifuged at 41,000 × g max for 2 h in a swinging bucket rotor. The band at the interface was collected, diluted 100% with homogenization buffer, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g max for 1 h. The final pellet was resuspended in storage buffer (10% sucrose, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.0) at ∼5 mg/ml protein. Aliquots were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C until used. Planar Lipid Bilayer Measurements—Cardiac RyRs were incorporated into planar lipid bilayer membranes as described previously (19Buck E.D. Lachnit W.G. Pessah I.N. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 289: 477-485PubMed Google Scholar). Bilayer membranes were formed from a 5:3 mixture of phosphatidylethanolamine: phosphatidylcholine suspended (50 mg/ml) in decane by painting the lipid/decane mixture across a 200-μm hole in the side of a polystyrene cup separating two chambers with a volume of 1 ml each. In experiments using Cs+ as the primary current carrier, sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes containing RyR (5 μg of total protein) were added to the cis chamber, which contained 500 mm CsCl, 200 μm CaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, whereas the trans chamber contained 250 mm CsCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. After fusion of vesicles, the cis chamber was rapidly perfused with 15 ml of the trans buffer with no added Ca2+. Single channel activity was measured at various holding potentials with respect to the trans (ground) side in the presence or absence of MTSEA+. In experiments using organic amines as the primary current carrier, sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles were fused to the bilayer, and the cis chamber was perfused with either CsCl or an amine-containing solution. Ruthenium red (2 μm) was applied to the cis chamber to verify that the channel activity being observed was ion currents through the RyR. Data were amplified (BC-525C, Warner Instruments, Inc., Hamden, CT), filtered at 1–3 kHz with a low pass eight-pole Bessel filter, digitized at 10 kHz (Digidata 1200, Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA), and stored on a personal computer. Subsequent data analysis was performed using pClamp (Axon Instruments). The MTSEA+-induced, stepwise decrease of the RyR current was irreversible and cumulative over time resulting in complete inhibition of channel currents as observed previously (5Quinn K.Q. Ehrlich B.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Sulfhydryl Compound Treatment—Modification of channel currents by MTSEA+ was performed in the presence of CsCl and various organic amines. After incorporation of RyR channels into the bilayer membrane, control measurements were acquired for at least 2 min followed by addition of MTSEA+ to the cis chamber. In all experiments, 50 μm MTSEA+ was used to modify the channel. At least three experiments were completed with each organic cation. Organic Amine Experiments—Current-voltage experiments were performed under bi-ionic conditions. Organic amines (250 mm amine, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) were present in the trans chamber, and the cis buffer was comprised of 250 mm CsCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Cs+ currents were measured at positive potentials, whereas the amine currents were measured at negative holding potentials. For experiments monitoring the development of subconductance levels, organic amines (250 mm amine, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) were present in both the cis and trans chambers. The amine subconductance levels were measured at –30 mV. Analysis of Current Amplitudes—Current amplitudes for the current-voltage relationships as shown in Figs. 2 and 3 were generated using all-point histograms (pClamp, Axon Instruments) for each current carrier. Open channel current amplitudes were collected for channels in the presence and absence of 50 μm MTSEA+. For clarity of presentation, only one transition state is shown for each current carrier tested. Lines through the points were generated by linear regression fits to the data.Fig. 3The Effect of MTSEA+ on the current-voltage relationship for each of the amines tested. Currents obtained before treatment with MTSEA+ are represented by circles, and MTSEA+-modified currents are represented by triangles. In each panel, data from a single experiment are shown; the number of experiments used in the analysis is provided after each test compound. The current amplitude for methylamine (n = 4) (A), dimethylamine (n = 4) (B), and ethylamine (n = 4) (C) were obtained at holding potentials ranging from –20 to –70 mV, and for trimethylamine (n = 3) (D) the holding potential was between –30 and –70 mV. MTSEA+ decreased the current amplitude for all current carriers. Only one MTSEA+-modified state was examined over the entire voltage range to calculate a conductance for this figure. Each point is the average of >100 channel openings. Error bars represent S.E. E (traces a–e), current traces of Cs+ and trimethylamine (TriMA) under bi-ionic conditions (250 mm CsCl in the cis chamber, 250 mm trimethylamine in the trans chamber). Trace a, the fully open state; trace b, the 3/4 state; trace c, the 1/2 state; trace d, the 1/4 state; trace e, blocked state. To the right of each trace, the full conductance for Cs+ is represented as a long dashed line, the subconductance state of both Cs+ and trimethylamine is a short dotted line, and the solid line represents the closed state. Note that trimethylamine current is abolished by MTSEA+ modification at the same time that the Cs+ current is only attenuated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The open channel current amplitudes sequentially decreased in response to prolonged exposure to MTSEA+. Once a channel reached the blocked state, transitions out of the blocked state were never observed. The subconductance current values were generated using all-point histograms. All-point histograms were generated from at least 2 s of continuously recorded data. Data were filtered at 1 kHz and fit with a Gaussian curve. Current amplitudes were calculated as the difference between the Gaussian means of the open and closed states. Errors shown in the figures were derived using the standard deviations from the Gaussian fit described above. Subconductance levels were determined by following the time course of the stepwise decrease in current amplitude. The fully open channel current amplitude for a given amine was divided by 4 to estimate the expected substate current amplitudes. The estimated and measured values were similar. All representative current traces shown in the figures were filtered at 500 Hz and are at least 500 ms long. Mean open and closed dwell times were calculated by generating events lists from filtered (700 Hz) data recordings lasting at least 2.5 min using pClamp (Axon Instruments). Histograms were drawn, and the data were fit to exponential curves using a simplex-least squares fitting method. The open and closed dwell time values were extracted from the fits to the data. In all cases error bars represent the S.E. of the exponential fit. Effect of MTSEA + on RyR Cationic Conductance—The modification of RyR currents by MTSEA+ was used to probe the conductance of several cations through the channel. Previous work showed that MTSEA+ reduced the single channel conductance of the RyR in a stepwise manner when Ba2+ was used as the current carrier (5Quinn K.Q. Ehrlich B.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). A difficulty associated with using this approach is that the relatively low conductance of Ba2+ (∼100 picosiemens) makes subconductance currents difficult to resolve. To address this issue, Cs+ was used as the control current carrier because the large amplitude currents carried by this ion allow greater discrimination of MTSEA+-induced subconductance states of the RyR. Then organic amines of increasing size (Table I) were used as test cations to probe the nature of the conducting pathway.Table IDiameters of the current carriersCurrent carriersDiameterÅCs+3.4Methylamine CH3NH3+3.8Dimethylamine (CH3)2NH2+4.6Ethylamine C2H5NH3+4.4Trimethylamine (CH3)3NH2+5.6 Open table in a new tab The relative difference in current amplitude among the test cations (Cs+, methylamine, dimethylamine, and ethylamine) was measured in the unmodified state at a holding potential of –30 mV except for trimethylamine, which was measured at –50 mV (Fig. 1). Trimethylamine currents were measured at a larger holding potential to increase the amplitude of the currents. As can be seen in Fig. 1, the observed current decreases with increasing ionic diameter. Although dimethylamine has a larger diameter than ethylamine, it has a larger conductance than ethylamine (Tables I and II). This result has been previously reported, and an explanation was provided that is based upon differences in the three-dimensional shape of the amines (20Tinker A. Williams A.J. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 1678-1683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The rod-like structure of dimethylamine results in a smaller orthogonal profile for this amine.Table IIConductance of the current carriersCurrent carriersControlMTSEA+Percentage of maximumpSCs+733 ± 35416 ± 5557Methylamine425 ± 43306 ± 3172Dimethylamine333 ± 9145 ± 2143Ethylamine189 ± 79134 ± 3071Trimethylamine120 ± 10—a—, no conductance was observed.—a —, no conductance was observed. Open table in a new tab The calculated conductances for the amines (Table II) are slightly larger than those reported previously (20Tinker A. Williams A.J. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 1678-1683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) because the concentration of amine used in our experiments was larger than those in the prior report (250 versus 210 mm, respectively (20Tinker A. Williams A.J. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 1678-1683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar)). However, when experiments in this series were performed using the same concentration as previously reported, similar conductance values were obtained. The permeability of the amines relative to Cs+ is similar to those reported by Tinker and Williams (1Tinker A. Williams A.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1993; 102: 1107-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) considering that the permeability ratio of K+/Cs+ is 0.6. To modify the channel, 50 μm MTSEA+ was used in all experiments because this concentration reduced RyR currents on a time scale slow enough for substate transitions to be monitored. Current-voltage relationships using Cs+ as the current carrier were acquired when the channel was in the full state and a subconductance state, showing that MTSEA+ modified the transmembrane current at every applied potential (Fig. 2). When transmembrane currents were measured using organic amines as the primary current carriers, MTSEA+ modified the currents at every applied potential (Fig. 3, A–D). The experiments using organic amines were performed under biionic conditions. In all cases, MTSEA+ modification of amine currents resulted in a concomitant modification of Cs+ currents. When the largest cation, trimethylamine, was used as current carrier, complete block of amine currents occurred before full block of Cs+ currents. That is, following partial modification of the RyR by MTSEA+, Cs+ was still able to pass through the channel with a reduced current amplitude, whereas trimethylamine currents could not be detected (Fig. 3E). This result indicates that the immediate loss of all trimethylamine currents was associated with partial block of the pore. When monitoring Ba2+ currents through the RyR, MTSEA+ modified the amplitude of the currents but not the ability to activate the channel with Ca2+ or ATP. Neither were the open probability (Po) nor the mean open and closed times of the receptor affected (5Quinn K.Q. Ehrlich B.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In this study, MTSEA+ also had no significant effect on the same parameters. In addition, the mean open and closed times for each tested current carrier (Table III) correlates directly with the Po (Table IV). Dashes in Table IV indicate the absence of channel activity due to modification by MTSEA+. The only alteration observed was the appearance of subconductance levels (Figs. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and Table V).Table IIIMean open (τo) and closed times (τc) of the RyR in the absence and presence of MTSEA+ for each current carrier used Values are presented as mean ± S.E.Current carriersStateCs+MethylamineDimethylamineEthylamineTrimethylamineτoτcτoτcτoτcτoτcτoτcmsFull16.12 ± 1.181.20 ± 0.1212.98 ± 0.451.17 ± 0.326.15 ± 0.352.35 ± 0.542.50 ± 0.558.22 ± 0.091.24 ± 0.176.63 ± 0.553/410.12 ± 0.604.44 ± 0.311.81 ± 0.349.57 ± 0.723.72 ± 0.615.88 ± 0.230.882 ± 0.195.02 ± 0.32—a—, subconductance states were not observed.—1/21.81 ± 0.251.00 ± 0.441.02 ± 0.287.42 ± 0.354.20 ± 0.164.11 ± 0.371.35 ± 0.223.89 ± 0.6——1/41.44 ± 0.1328.85 ± 0.721.99 ± 0.1852.75 ± 0.89—bThe number of openings was too low for analysis.—bThe number of openings was too low for analysis.————a —, subconductance states were not observed.b The number of openings was too low for analysis.
