https://openalex.org/W2155868854,"A cDNA encoding a novel member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPKK) family, MAPKK6, was isolated and found to encode a protein of 334 amino acids, with a calculated molecular mass of 37 kDa that is 79% identical to MKK3. MAPKK6 was shown to phosphorylate and specifically activate the p38/MPK2 subgroup of the mitogen-activated protein kinase superfamily and could be demonstrated to be phosphorylated and activated in vitro by TAK1, a recently identified MAPKK kinase. MKK3 was also shown to be a good substrate for TAK1 in vitro. Furthermore, when co-expressed with TAK1 in cells in culture, both MAPKK6 and MKK3 were strongly activated. In addition, co-expression of TAK1 and p38/MPK2 in cells resulted in activation of p38/MPK2. These results indicate the existence of a novel kinase cascade consisting of TAK1, MAPKK6/MKK3, and p38/MPK2."

The removal of sulfur-centered radicals or H2O2 has been proposed as the protective mechanism of TSA. Like catalase, TSA prevents the initiation of the rapid O2 uptake phase during MCO of DTT but causes only partial inhibition when added after the reaction is well into the propagation phase. Stoichiometric studies showed that the antioxidant property of TSA is, at least in part, due to its ability to catalyze the destruction of H2O2 by the overall reaction 2 RSH + H2O2→ RSSR + H2O. Results of kinetic studies demonstrate that the removal of H2O2 by TSA correlates with its ability to protect glutamine synthetase from inactivation. In the presence of thioredoxin, TSA is more active, whereas C170S (an active mutant of TSA in which cysteine 170 was replaced by a serine) and open reading frame 6 (a human antioxidant protein homologous to TSA with only one conserved cysteine residue) are only slightly affected. The thiol specificity of the protective activity of TSA derives from the fact that the oxidized form of TSA can be converted back to its sulfhydryl form by treatment with thiols but not by ascorbate.

As forskolin has been shown to stimulate intestinal Na+/glucose cotransport, we have used electrophysiological techniques to examine the role of protein kinases in regulating Na+/glucose cotransporters, SGLT1, expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. We monitored SGLT1 kinetics, the number of SGLT1 cotransporters in the plasma membrane, and plasma membrane area before and after activation of protein kinases. 8-Bromoadenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (8-Br-cAMP) and sn-1,2-dioctanoylglycerol (DOG) were used as membrane permeable activators of protein kinases A (PKA) and C (PKC), respectively. In oocytes expressing rabbit SGLT1 8-Br-cAMP increased by 28 ± 4% (n = 10), and DOG decreased by 51 ± 5% (n = 13) the maximum rate of Na+/glucose cotransport. These reversible changes in the maximum transport rate occurred within minutes, and were accompanied by proportional changes in the number of cotransporters in the membrane and area of the plasma membrane. This suggests that protein kinases regulate rabbit SGLT1 activity by controlling the distribution of transporters between intracellular compartments and the plasma membrane, and that this occurs by exo- and endocytosis. Similar increases in maximum transport were obtained with activation of PKA in oocytes expressing rabbit, human, and rat SGLT1 isoforms, but with activation of PKC the response was isoform-dependent. PKC activation decreased the maximum rate of transport by rabbit and rat SGLT1, but increased transport by human SGLT1. We conclude that: (i) the regulation of SGLT1 expression in oocytes by protein kinases occurs mainly by regulated endo- and exocytosis; (ii) it is independent of consensus phosphorylation sites in the transporter; and (iii) the effect of a given kinase depends upon the actual sequence of the cotransporter expressed. These considerations may also apply to the regulation of other cotransporters by protein kinases in oocytes, cells, and tissues.

https://openalex.org/W2059039694,"When mouse 30A5 preadipocytes are exposed to high glucose concentrations, acetyl-CoA carboxylase is induced through glucose activation of promoter II of the acetyl-CoA carboxylase gene. Glucose treatment of the cells increases Sp1 binding to two GC-rich glucose response elements in promoter II. We have investigated the mechanism by which glucose increases Sp1 binding and transactivation of promoter II in 30A5 cells. DNA mobility shift assays have shown that nuclear extracts from glucose-treated cells exhibit increased Sp1 binding activity. This increase in the binding activity is not due to glucose-mediated changes in the amount of Sp1 in the nucleus but to an increase in the activity that modifies Sp1 so that it binds more effectively to the promoter sequence. This Sp1 modifying activity is inhibited by okadaic acid and phosphatase inhibitor 2, and has a molecular mass of 38–42 kDa. The catalytic subunit of type 1 protein phosphatase, whose molecular mass is 38 kDa, also increased the ability of Sp1 to bind to promoter II. Treatment of nuclear extract with antibodies against the catalytic subunit partially suppressed the nuclear activity for Sp1 activation. From these results, we conclude that the Sp1 transcription factor exhibits enhanced binding to promoter II and transcriptional activation is the result of glucose-induced dephosphorylation by type 1 phosphatase.

https://openalex.org/W2075445167,"Subcellular localization and coupling to ATP synthesis were investigated with respect to the denitrifying systems of two fungi, Fusarium oxysporum and Cylindrocarpon tonkinense. Dissimilatory nitrate reductase of F. oxysporum or nitrite reductase of C. tonkinense could be detected in the mitochondrial fraction prepared from denitrifying cells of each fungus. Fluorescence immunolocalization, cofractionation with mitochondrial marker enzymes, and cytochromes provided evidence that the denitrifying enzymes are co-purified with mitochondria. Respiratory substrates such as malate plus pyruvate, succinate, and formate were effective donors of electrons to these activities in the mitochondrial fractions. Moreover, nitrite and nitrate reduction were shown to be coupled to the synthesis of ATP with energy yields (P:NO3− or P:2e ratios) of 0.88 to 1.4, depending upon whether malate/pyruvate or succinate were provided as substrates. Nitrate or nitrite reductase activity was inhibited by inhibitors such as rotenone, antimycin A, and thenoyltrifluoroacetone. Thus, fungal denitrification activities are localized to mitochondria and are coupled to the synthesis of ATP. The existence of these novel respiration systems are discussed with regard to the origin and evolution of mitochondria.

The existence of these novel respiration systems are discussed with regard to the origin and evolution of mitochondria. Denitrification is a process whereby nitrate or nitrite is reduced to a gaseous form of nitrogen (N2 or N2O). Biological denitrifying activities, which play important roles in the global nitrogen cycle, were believed to be uniquely characteristic of prokaryotes (1Zumft W.G. Balows A. Truper H.G. Dworkin M.

Whether the fungal denitrification systems resemble bacterial systems for anaerobic respiration and, if so, whether they are localized to mitochondria has not been established. Bacterial denitrification usually involves four sequential reactions, which are catalyzed by nitrate reductase (Nar), 1The abbreviations used are: Narnitrate reductaseNirnitrite reductaseNornitric oxide reductaseP450cytochrome P450P450nor and P450nor2cytochrome P450 nitric oxide reductase and its isozymePMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoridePMSphenazine methosulfateTMPDN,N,N′,N′-tetramethylphenylenediamineMVHreduced methylviologenTTFAthenoyltrifluoroacetoneMes4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. nitrite reductase (Nir), nitric oxide (NO) reductase (Nor), and nitrous oxide (N2O) reductase, respectively (1Zumft W.G.

Among fungal denitrifying systems, those of Fusarium oxysporum and Cylindrocarpon tonkinense have been best characterized (6Usuda K. Toritsuka N. Matsuo Y. Kim D.-H. Shoun H. Appl. Environ.

Fungal systems usually lack N2O reductase, and consequently evolve N2O as the final denitrification product (4Shoun H. Tanimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11078-11082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Shoun H. Kim D.-H. Uchiyama H. Sugiyama J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1992; 94: 277-282Crossref Google Scholar, 6Usuda K. Toritsuka N. Matsuo Y. Kim D.-H. Shoun H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 883-889Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Many systems such as that of C. tonkinense also lack Nar. However, many bacterial denitrifying (or nitrate-respiring) systems may also lack part of the reductase chain (1Zumft W.G. Balows A. Truper H.G. Dworkin M. Harder W. Schleifer K.H.

Involvement of cytochrome P450 (P450nor) for Nor is typical in the fungal systems that have been analyzed to date (4Shoun H. Tanimoto T. J. Biol.

In contrast, Nir isolated from F. oxysporum is very similar to its copper-containing counterparts of bacteria (11Kobayashi M. Shoun H. J. Biol.

Toritsuka N. Matsuo Y. Kim D.-H. Shoun H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 883-889Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These findings are highly indicative that fungal denitrification is an energy-yielding process like the bacterial counterpart. nitrate reductase nitrite reductase nitric oxide reductase cytochrome P450 cytochrome P450 nitric oxide reductase and its isozyme phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride phenazine methosulfate N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylphenylenediamine reduced methylviologen thenoyltrifluoroacetone 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. We proposed previously that the reactions catalyzed by Nar in F. oxysporum and by Nir in C. tonkinense might be coupled to the synthesis of ATP (4Shoun H. Tanimoto T. J. Biol.

We now demonstrate the intracellular localization of the reductases, characterize their electron donors, and show they are coupled to the synthesis of ATP. F. oxysporum MT 811, first identified as a fungal denitrifier (4Shoun H. Tanimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11078-11082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and C. tonkinense IFO 30561, that was shown to grow under denitrifying conditions (6Usuda K. Toritsuka N. Matsuo Y. Kim D.-H. Shoun H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 883-889Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were used throughout this work. Denitrifying cells (5 g, wet weight), cultivated in a glycerol-containing medium under micro-aerobic condition (4Shoun H. Tanimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11078-11082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Kobayashi M. Shoun H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4146-4151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), were disrupted by grinding in a mortar on ice with quartz sand (12.5 g) and 10 ml of sucrose buffer (0.8 M sucrose, 2 mM EDTA, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.2) that contained 0.3 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). After addition of another 10 ml of the same buffer, the slurry was centrifuged 3 times at 1,500 × g for 15 min to remove the quartz sand and undisrupted cells. The subsequent pellet obtained by two sequential centrifugations at 10,000 × g for 40 min was suspended in the sucrose buffer and then subjected to ultracentrifugation in a discontinuous sucrose density (43.1, 50.4, and 68.9%) gradient, at 105,000 × g for 180 min. The 10,000 × g supernatant was further fractionated into the soluble and microsomal fractions by centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 60 min. Each fraction obtained was incubated under aerobic conditions for 60 min at room temperature in the sucrose buffer containing 4 mM ADP, 4 mM MgCl2, and 10 mM sodium phosphate to deplete endogenous electron donors. Finally, each fraction was pelleted by centrifugation at 150,000 × g and subsequently resuspended in the sucrose buffer. Denitrifying cells were cultured under initially aerobic condition (6Usuda K. Toritsuka N. Matsuo Y. Kim D.-H. Shoun H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 883-889Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, glucose in the reported culture medium was replaced with an equivalent level of glycerol. Cells were disrupted as above except that the buffer was 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.6 M mannitol, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.3 mM PMSF, 0.3 mM leupeptin, and 0.5 mM tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone. Subcellular fractions were prepared as in the case of F. oxysporum above except that the 10,000 × g pellet was fractionated in a sucrose density gradient of 25, 35, 42, and 53%. All manipulations were performed at room temperature. A drop of the putative mitochondrial fraction from F. oxysporum was smeared on a glass slide, air-dried, and fixed for 10 min with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl). The sample was washed for 10 min in phosphate-buffered saline and blocked with BAT (10% BlockAce (Dainihonseiyaku Inc., Osaka, Japan), 0.1% Triton X-100) for 30 min. Rabbit antiserum against Nir was diluted 1:200 with BAT and incubated with the sample for 2 h. The sample was then washed for 15 min in TBS-TX (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100) and incubated for 1 h with a drop of Texas Red-linked antibodies against rabbit IgG raised in a donkey (Amersham Corp., Bucks, UK) and diluted 1:100 with BAT containing 1 µg/ml Hoechst 33342 (Hoechst, Germany). The sample was washed for 15 min in TBS-TX, rinsed in TBS (TBS-TX without Triton X-100), and mounted in anti-fade solution (0.1% paraphenylenediamine, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 90% glycerol). Confocal fluorescence images were obtained with a laser scanning confocal system (MRC-500; Bio-Rad) attached to a microscope with epifluorescence optics (BHS-RFC; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Fluorescence due to Hoechst 33342 was recorded with a CD camera (model XC-73CE; Sony, Tokyo, Japan) and the MRC-500 system. The antiserum against Nir was produced by immunizing a rabbit with purified Nir from F. oxysporum (11Kobayashi M. Shoun H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4146-4151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) (Biologica, Nagoya, Japan). The specificity of the antiserum was confirmed by Western blot analysis (see Fig. 4C). A negative control was also prepared in which antiserum against Nir was replaced by preimmune rabbit serum. No staining with Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibody was observed (data not shown). ATP was quantitated by the luciferin-luciferase bioluminescence technique with a Lucifer-LU kit (Kikkoman, Chiba, Japan) and an ATP photometer (NU-620; Niti-ion, Tokyo, Japan). An aliquot (0.1 ml) was taken for each time point and added to 0.4 ml of 0.125 N perchloric acid on ice. The solution was then neutralized with 0.5 ml of 0.1 N NaOH. After centrifugation (10,000 × g, 60 min, 4°C) the sample was diluted to a concentration below 1 µM ATP with 20 mM HEPES-NaOH buffer (pH 7.55) that contained 10 mM MgSO4 and 2 mM EDTA. The amount of ATP synthesized is indicated as the difference between the total amount at each time point and that at 0 time. Nar activity was detected by quantitation of its product, nitrite, by the method of Nicholas and Nason (13Nicholas D.J.D. Nason A. Methods Enzymol. 1957; 3: 981-984Crossref Scopus (408) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture for Nar (final volume, 2 ml) contained 10 mM sodium nitrate, 50 mM methylviologen, 2 mM dithionite, and a fraction that contained Nar in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.7). Reactions were incubated anaerobically at 30°C. For assays of mitochondrial Nar, each fraction was incubated anaerobically at 25°C in the sucrose buffer plus 10 mM sodium nitrate, 4 mM MgCl2, 10 mM sodium phosphate, 4 mM ADP, and an electron donor (5 mM) (total volume, 2 ml). The anaerobic technique was described previously (11Kobayashi M. Shoun H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4146-4151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The gas phase was replaced with carbon monoxide to suppress the activities of Nir and cytochrome oxidase. Nir activity derived by physiological electron donors was assayed by quantitating its reaction product (NO) either by the P450nor-trapping method (11Kobayashi M. Shoun H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4146-4151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) or by gas chromatography. The gas chromatography method employed quantification of N2O that was converted from NO by an NAD(P)H-dependent reaction catalyzed by P450nor of F. oxysporum or P450nor2 of C. tonkinense (6Usuda K. Toritsuka N. Matsuo Y. Kim D.-H. Shoun H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 883-889Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Kobayashi M. Shoun H. J. Biol.

The reaction mixture (2 ml) for assays by the P450nor-trapping method contained the mitochondrial fraction (0.09 mg protein), 2 mM sodium nitrite, 10 mM potassium phosphate, 2 µM P450nor from F. oxysporum (7Nakahara K. Tanimoto T. Hatano K. Usuda K. Shoun H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8350-8355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 5 mM electron donor, and a buffer containing 0.6 M mannitol, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.3 mM PMSF, and 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). Reactions were incubated at 25°C in a Thunberg-type cuvette and the increase in absorbance at 432 nm was monitored. The gas phase in the cuvette was replaced with helium and the reaction was initiated by mixing a condensed solution of the electron donor in a side arm containing to other reaction mixture components. The reaction mixture (1.75 ml) for assays by the gas chromatography method contained 5 mM sodium nitrite, 0.8 µM P450nor2, 10 mM potassium phosphate, 1.5 mM sodium azide (to inhibit aerobic respiration), 5 mM ADP, 2.5 mM NADPH, 5 mM electron donor, and the mitochondrial fraction (0.33 mg protein). Reactions were incubated at 25°C in a test tube sealed with a butyl rubber stopper (7 ml). The gas phase in the tube was replaced with helium. Nir activity driven by artificial electron donors was assayed either by the gas chromatography method or P450nor-trapping method above except NADH-phenazinemethosulfate (PMS) or ascorbate-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylphenylenediamine (TMPD) were provided as electron donors. The difference absorption spectrum was measured with an RSP-701 multichannel spectrophotometer (Unisoku, Osaka, Japan) equipped with a xenon lamp. Cytochrome oxidase activity was assayed aerobically in 100 mM Mes-KOH buffer (pH 6.7) with 10 µM reduced cytochrome c from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Sigma), and the change in absorbance at 550 nm at 25°C was monitored. -Denitrifying cells of F. oxysporum and C. tonkinense were disrupted and fractionated, and the distribution in the various subcellular fractions of Nar (F. oxysporum) and Nir (C. tonkinense) was investigated (Fig. 1). Fig. 1A shows distribution of Nar activity in fractions from F. oxysporum. In addition to an artificial electron donor (reduced methylviologen (MVH)), respiratory substrates, malate plus pyruvate, were effective donors of electrons for the activity. Although MVH-dependent Nar and the marker enzyme (cytochrome oxidase) activities were recovered in various fractions, Nar activity supported by malate plus pyruvate was enriched in fraction II (50.4% sucrose). The result is highly indicative that the fraction contained intact mitochondria. Nir activity was also detected in fraction II of F. oxysporum (data not shown). This fraction additionally contained cytochromes a and b (Fig. 2), as well as cytochrome oxidase activity (Fig. 1A).Fig. 2Presence of cytochromes a and b in the mitochondrial fraction of F. oxysporum. Difference absorption spectrum of dithionite-reduced minus nonreduced fraction II in Fig. 1 was recorded.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig. 1B shows distribution of cytochrome oxidase and Nir among various subcellular fractions of C. tonkinense. Most of the NADH-PMS-dependent Nir activity was recovered in the 35% sucrose fraction (fraction 2). Most of cytochrome oxidase activity was also recovered in this fraction, whereas catalase (a marker enzyme of peroxisome) activity was primarily in the 42% sucrose fraction (fraction 3) (data not shown). Apparently, mitochondria of C. tonkinense grown under micro-aerobic conditions are less dense and/or have a smaller sedimentation coefficient than those of F. oxysporum. As shown above, malate plus pyruvate were effective donors of electrons to the Nar activity of the mitochondrial fraction of F. oxysporum. This suggests that electrons were supplied to Nar from these respiratory substrates via the mitochondrial electron transport system. As shown in Fig. 3, formate and succinate were also effective electron donors for Nar. In contrast, NADH is ineffective in donating electrons to the activity, consistent with the fact that NADH does not permeate into the mitochondrial matrix. Formate is a physiological electron donor for the reduction of nitrate in the nitrate respiration system of Escherichia coli (14Ferry J.G. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 87: 377-382Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 15Sawers G. Antonie Leeuwenhoek. 1994; 66: 57-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and the fungal Nar system resembles the bacterial system in this regard. Malate plus pyruvate and succinate were also effective donors of electrons to the mitochondrial Nir activity of C. tonkinense (see Fig. 6, Fig. 7, Fig. 8).Fig. 6Effects of respiratory inhibitors on the Nir activity in the mitochondrial fraction of C. tonkinense.Fraction 2 (0.09 mg of protein) in Fig. 1B was assayed for Nir activity in the presence of each inhibitor (20 µM) employing malate plus pyruvate (A), succinate (B), or ascorbate (5 mM), TMPD (0.2 mM) (C) as electron donors. Formation of NO, the reaction product, was monitored by the P450nor-trapping method. Inhibitor: (– - - –), rotenone; (- - - - -), antimycin A; (– - –), TTFA; (––), no inhibitor; (- - - -), no inhibitor but without nitrite (employed only in C).

ATP synthesis in C and D are coupled, respectively, to the NO formation in A and B. NO was quantitated by the gas chromatography method. As in the case of NADH in Fig. 3, NADPH added to support the reaction catalyzed by P450nor2 had no effect on the mitochondrial Nir activity (data not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 7Association of Nar of F. oxysporum with the respiratory chain that is coupled to oxidative phosphorylation.Fraction II (0.45 mg of protein) in Fig. 1 was incubated with ADP employing pyruvate plus malate as an electron donor under the anaerobic and carbon monoxide-replaced conditions (see “Experimental Procedures”), and formed nitrite (A) and ATP (B) were quantitated simultaneously. (○), complete; (•), minus nitrate. The amount of ATP synthesized is indicated as the difference between the absolute amount at each time point and that at 0 time. The increase in the level of ATP in the replicate experiment without nitrate (B) might have been due to myokinase activity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Further evidence that fraction II from F. oxysporum really contained mitochondria was obtained by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 4). Staining by the indirect fluorescent antibody technique showed that particles in fraction II contained Nir (Fig. 4A). These also reacted with the DNA-specific dye (Fig. 4B) showing that they were mitochondria. The results of immunostaining (Fig. 4A) further supported our previous assertion that the Nir of this fungus is located in the intermembrane space of the mitochondrion (11Kobayashi M. Shoun H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4146-4151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The effectiveness of various respiratory substrates as electron donors for the mitochondrial activities of Nar and Nir are strong evidence that the fungal denitrifying system was associated with the mitochondrial respiratory chain. This was confirmed by the effects of treatments with a detergent or respiratory inhibitors on the mitochondrial Nar and Nir activities. The malate plus pyruvate-dependent mitochondrial Nar activity of F. oxysporum was lost upon treatment with deoxycholate, while the MVH-dependent activity was unaffected (Fig. 5). Inhibitors of respiration, namely rotenone, antimycin A, and thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTFA), strongly inhibited the mitochondrial Nir activity of C. tonkinense (Fig. 6, A and B), while they did not affect the ascorbate-TMPD-dependent activity (Fig. 6C). Deoxycholate (Fig. 5) apparently did not inhibit Nar activity itself but destroyed the aligned electron transport system for oxidation of pyruvate and malate. Thus, pyruvate- and malate-dependent Nir activity was inhibited by rotenone and antimycin but was not inhibited by TTFA, while succinate-dependent Nir activity was inhibited by antimycin and TTFA but not by rotenone (Figs. 6, A and B). Therefore, the fungal Nir shares the mitochondrial electron transport system for aerobic respiration and requires electrons from complex III as do the bacterial nitrite reductases (1Zumft W.G. Balows A. Truper H.G. Dworkin M. Harder W. Schleifer K.H. The Prokaryotes. 2nd Ed. Springer -Verlag, New York1992: 554Google Scholar). The mitochondrial reactions catalyzed by Nar and Nir were coupled to the synthesis of ATP (Fig. 7, Fig. 8). The energy yield (P:NO3− or P:2e ratio) (1Zumft W.G. Balows A. Truper H.G. Dworkin M. Harder W. Schleifer K.H. The Prokaryotes. 2nd Ed. Springer -Verlag, New York1992: 554Google Scholar, 16Yamanaka T. Ota A. Okunuki K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1962; 51: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) was 1.4 for the pyruvate/malate-dependent reaction catalyzed by Nar (at 3 min), and it was 1.0 and 0.88 for the pyruvate- and malatedependent and the succinate-dependent reaction catalyzed by Nir (between 2 and 6 min), respectively. The synthesis of ATP was also inhibited by antimycin A (data not shown). No synthesis of ATP was observed in replicate experiments in which the mixture of pyruvate and malate together or succinate was replaced by Nar or Nir artificial electron donors, even though formation of the reaction products, namely nitrite or NO, were detected (data not shown). Our results clearly demonstrate the presence of novel forms of respiratory metabolism in mitochondria of denitrifying fungi. While the mitochondrion has been regarded as the aerobic organelle of eukaryotes, the occurrence of anaerobic respiration in fungal mitochondria evokes interesting questions. First, what is the evolutionary relationship between the fungal and bacterial denitrifying systems? We previously determined that Nir of F. oxysporum bears close resemblance to the copper-containing counterpart in bacteria (11Kobayashi M. Shoun H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4146-4151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Intracellular localization in the intermembrane space in mitochondria (see Fig. 4) would also parallel localization in the periplasm of most of the bacterial enzymes (1Zumft W.G. Balows A. Truper H.G. Dworkin M. Harder W. Schleifer K.H. The Prokaryotes. 2nd Ed. Springer -Verlag, New York1992: 554Google Scholar, 2Stouthamer A.H. Antonie Leeuwenhoek. 1992; 61: 1-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 3Ferguson S.J. Antonie Leeuwenhoek. 1994; 66: 89-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Since formate can donate electrons to the mitochondrial Nar activity (Fig. 3), we suppose there is a formate dehydrogenase system that is directly associated with the respiratory chain that can support the anaerobic reduction of nitrate (14Ferry J.G. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 87: 377-382Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 15Sawers G. Antonie Leeuwenhoek. 1994; 66: 57-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Thus the fungal Nar system generally resembles the nitrate-reducing system in E. coli and other nitrate-respiring bacteria. Further, Nar of F. oxysporum resembles the bacterial counterpart in that it is membrane-bound and composed of 3 (or 4) subunits which are similar in molecular size to those of bacteria. 2H. Enjoji, A. Takimoto, and H. Shoun, unpublished data. While the Nar and Nir systems in F. oxysporum seem to resemble those of the bacterial denitrifying systems, the P450-dependent Nor system of fungi contrasts with the cytochrome bc type Nor of bacteria (1Zumft W.G. Balows A. Truper H.G. Dworkin M. Harder W. Schleifer K.H. The Prokaryotes. 2nd Ed. Springer -Verlag, New York1992: 554Google Scholar, 2Stouthamer A.H. Antonie Leeuwenhoek. 1992; 61: 1-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 3Ferguson S.J. Antonie Leeuwenhoek. 1994; 66: 89-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Nor of the P450 type has not been detected bacteria, although we have suggested horizontal transfer of the P450 gene from bacteria to the denitrifying fungi during evolution (17Kizawa H. Tomura D. Oda M. Fukamizu A. Hoshino T. Gotoh O. Yasui T. Shoun H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10632-10637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). According to John and Whatley (18John P. Whatley F.R. Nature. 1975; 254: 495-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), the denitrifying bacterium Paracoccus denitrificans has many features of mitochondria that render it as a direct descendant of the endosymbiotic protomitochondria that gave rise to the mitochondrion. The mitochondria of eukaryotic cells are believed, therefore, to have lost adaptive systems, such as denitrification, during their evolution. This hypothesis is supported by systematic comparisons of sequences of 16S rRNA that show that the α subclass of proteobacteria, to which P. denitrificans belongs, are most closely related to mitochondria (2Stouthamer A.H. Antonie Leeuwenhoek. 1992; 61: 1-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 19Yang D. Oyaizu Y. Oyaizu H. Olsen G.J. Woese C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4443-4447Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 20Van de Peer Y. Neefs J.-M. De Wachter R. J. Mol. Evol. 1990; 30: 463-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 21Margulis L. Symbiosis in Cell Evolution. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman Co., New York1993: 305Google Scholar). In view of this hypothesis, the present results may indicate that fungal mitochondria have retained the adaptive denitrifying system of the protomitochondrion. However, this hypothesis cannot account for the unique involvement of P450 in the fungal Nor system. While P450nor is recovered from fungal cells in a soluble form, there are two isoforms of P450nor, one of which contains in its gene a presequence resembling the targeting and sorting signals for import into mitochondria. 3K. Nakahara and H. Shoun, unpublished data. 4T. Kudo, D. Liu, D. Tomura, and H. Shoun, unpublished data. While mitochondria of denitrifying fungi seem to contain a set of reductases (Nar, Nir, and Nor in F. oxysporum, and Nir and Nor in C. tonkinense) it is unclear whether the fungal denitrifying system is truly a remnant of the protomitochondrion or it is system that was acquired at a later evolutionary stage. The morphology of mitochondria during the anaerobic growth also deserves attention. The mitochondria of yeasts exist in a “promitochondria” form when cells are growing under anaerobic, fermenting conditions (21Margulis L. Symbiosis in Cell Evolution. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman Co., New York1993: 305Google Scholar). In contrast, fungal mitochondria are only moderately modified during exposure to denitrifying conditions (Fig. 4). The fungal cells used in this study were grown under a micro-aerobic or an initially aerobic (4Shoun H. Tanimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11078-11082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Usuda K. Toritsuka N. Matsuo Y. Kim D.-H. Shoun H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 883-889Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) condition and cytochrome oxidase was also detected (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). However, the denitrifying systems of F. oxysporum and C. tonkinense differ in response to oxygen tensions. The system of F. oxysporum seems to be induced to supplement the aerobic respiration (22Tanimoto T. Nakahara K. Shoun H. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1992; 56: 2058-2059Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar), while that of C. tonkinense acts more positively to support cell growth even under much more restricted aeration (6Usuda K. Toritsuka N. Matsuo Y. Kim D.-H. Shoun H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 883-889Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The morphological and electron transport capabilities of mitochondria in C. tonkinense that grown under denitrification, restricted aeration conditions deserves further study."

These results suggest that dynamic and regulated interactions occur between neurofilaments to form viscoelastic networks with properties distinct from other cytoskeletal structures. Neurofilaments function in axons by providing mechanical stability to these long processes and forming a scaffolding upon which other structural elements, including microtubules, microfilaments, mitochondria, and perhaps the cell membrane, are supported (1Hirokawa N.

Like all intermediate filament proteins, neurofilament (NF) 1The abbreviations used are: NFneurofilamentMTmicrotubuleMes4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidPIP2phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphateIFintermediate filament. proteins share a conserved sequence responsible for the formation of α-helical coiled coil dimers that assemble further into tetramers and then into long filaments of 10-nm diameter. Neurofilaments are unique in being composed of three subunits (NF-H, NF-M, and NF-L) two of which (NF-H and NF-M) have long C-terminal extensions that influence, but are not absolutely required for filament assembly in vitro. On the other hand, at least one of the large subunits must be expressed in vivo to produce filaments (3Nakagawa T. Chen J. Zhang Z. Kanai Y. Hirokawa N. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 411-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and the function of the long extensions appears to be formation of bridges to other NF (4Hirokawa N. J.

Phosphorylation of numerous sites on repetitive sequences of NF side arms occurs during NF axonal transport and is locally modified in correlation with increased NF bundle density in Ranvier nodes (12Mata M. Kupina N. Fink D.J. J. Neurocytol. 1992; 21: 199-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Hyperphosphorylated NF epitopes are associated with abnormal accumulation of NF in pathological situations (13Itoh T. Sobue G. Ken E. Mitsuma T. Takahashi A. Trojanowski J.Q. Acta Neuropathol. 1992; 83: 240-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 14Lee M.K. Cleveland D.W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 34-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). How such phosphorylations affect interactions of neurofilaments with each other or with other molecules is not known. The hypothesis that transient interactions between NF and/or between NF and other subcellular elements such as microtubules (MT) participate in the slow transport of polymerized NF is suggested by the local accumulation of axonal NF after their separation from MT following iminodipropionitrile intoxication (15Griffin J.W. Hoffman P.N. Clark A.W. Carroll P.T. Price D.L. Science. 1978; 202: 633-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). This alteration of NF transport may result from the disruption by the drug of the MT-NF cross-bridges (16Papasozomenos S.C. Binder L.I. Bender P.K. Payne M.R. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 74-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The impairment of NF axonal transport in mice expressing a transgene bearing β-galactosidase at the end of the NF-H carboxyl-terminal side arm also suggests the requirement for labile interactions between NF in the active mechanism of their export from the perinuclear cytoplasm. The presence of active β-galactosidase in NF networks is likely to stabilize cross-links between NF polymers mediated by β-galactosidase tetramerization (17Eyer J. Peterson A. Neuron. 1994; 12: 389-405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). One of the consequences of interactions between side arms of long filamentous polymers is that they alter the mechanical properties of networks formed by such filaments. Previous reports showed that purified NF form highly viscous gels (18Leterrier J.-L. Eyer J. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) which are influenced by the phosphorylation level of NF subunits (19Eyer J. Leterrier J.F. Biochem. J. 1988; 252: 655-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 20Gou J.P. Eyer J. Leterrier J.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 368-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the extent of NF gelation is affected in vitro by iminodipropionitrile (21Eyer J. Mclean W.G. Leterrier J.F. J. Neurochem. 1989; 52: 1759-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and Al3+ ions (22Leterrier J.F. Langui D. Probst A. Ulrich J. J. Neurochem. 1992; 58: 2060-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), two compounds that induce NF accumulation in animal models of neuropathies (15Griffin J.W. Hoffman P.N. Clark A.W. Carroll P.T. Price D.L. Science. 1978; 202: 633-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 23Bizzi A. Crane R.C. Autilio G.L. Gambetti P. J. Neurosci. 1984; 4: 722-731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cross-bridges between purified NF in vitro exhibit the same morphological characteristics as those measured in situ (3Nakagawa T. Chen J. Zhang Z. Kanai Y. Hirokawa N. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 411-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 6Gotow T. Takeda M. Tanaka T. Hashimoto P.H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 58: 331-345PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that similar domains of the NF-H and NF-M subunits are involved in both situations. We analyzed in this work the structure and viscoelastic, or rheologic, properties of NF networks using a variety of rheometric and optical methods. The structures of single NF in solution and within a gel were determined by electron microscopy and by video-enhanced fluorescence microscopy of labeled NF protein. To distinguish the specific effects of NF cross-bridges from viscoelastic features common to IF, similar experiments were also done with vimentin, an IF protein that lacks long C-terminal extensions. To assess the possibility that cross-bridge formation might be modulated in situ, effects of various potential modulators such as phosphorylation levels, inositol lipids, and actin filaments were also examined. Bovine spinal cords were obtained from a local slaughterhouse. NF were purified according to Leterrier and Eyer (18Leterrier J.-L. Eyer J. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) with some modifications; the crude NF pellet was purified by sedimentation at 200,000 × g for 3 h 30 min at 4°C onto 5 ml of 1.5 M sucrose in buffer A (Mes 0.1 M, MgCl2 1 mM, EGTA 1 mM, pH 6.8) and 15 ml of 0.8 M sucrose in buffer A. This step recovers NF as a pellet, removing minor contaminants in the sucrose layer. Purified NF resuspended in buffer A containing 0.8 M sucrose were dialyzed against the same buffer at 4°C (24 h). Dialyzed NF were gently homogenized with a Teflon-glass potter, and 1-ml aliquots were frozen in liquid nitrogen for storage at −135°C. Samples were slowly thawed on ice before measurements of rheology at 24°C of 3 mg of NF/ml in the presence of 5 mM MgCl2 (see below: precautions for reproducible measurements) and a mixture of protease inhibitors at the final concentrations: Nα-p-tosyl-L-arginine methyl ester 0.1 mg/ml; aprotinin 0.05 unit/ml; pepstatin A 1 µM; leupeptin 1 µM; phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride 1 mM; chloroquin 0.1 mM; soybean trypsin inhibitor 10 nM. Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), protease inhibitors, and acid phosphatase (type II from potato; 0.93 mg/ml, 88 units/mg) were from Sigma. Vimentin, purified according to Nelson and Traub (24Nelson W.J. Traub P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5536-5543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was a gift from Peter Traub and Manfred Schliwa. 3 mg/ml vimentin was dissolved in 10 mM Tris, pH 7.6, 6 mM dithiothreitol, and 6 M urea, and dialyzed overnight against the same buffer lacking urea. Vimentin polymerization was initiated by adding 150 mM KCl and protease inhibitors before incubation. Actin was purified from rabbit skeletal muscle (25Spudich J. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and polymerized in 2 mM MgCl2, 150 mM KCl, 0.2 mM CaCl2, 0.2 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM ATP, 2 mM Tris, pH 7.4. Gelsolin was obtained according to Kurokawa et al. (26Kurokawa H. Fujii W. Ohmi K. Sakurai T. Nonomura Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 168: 451-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Most viscoelastic measurements were made with a torsion pendulum (27Janmey P.A. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1991; 22: 41-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) by measuring free oscillations after imposition of a momentary displacement. Frequency-dependent oscillatory measurements were made with a Rheometrics (Piscataway NJ) RFSII instrument (28Janmey P.A. Hvidt S. Käs J. Lerche D. Maggs A. Sackmann E. Schliwa M. Stossel T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32503-32513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Dynamic measurements with the pendulum were made by applying a momentary impulse causing a low strain (<5%). The resonance frequency of oscillations of the sample after its initial perturbation allowed the determination of G′. This measurement was made repeatedly on samples at rest during the time course of the gel formation. Alternatively, after gel formation was largely complete, G′ was measured from oscillations in samples that were deformed under a constant stress. In these cases the deformation (strain) induced by the constant stress was usually much larger than the additional strain during oscillations, and therefore such measurements reflect the viscoelastic resistance of the sample in a deformed state. A third condition was the application of a constant stress to gelled samples followed by the measurement of strain as a function of time. The formation of NF gels in vitro is highly dependent on the conformation of the polymers (18Leterrier J.-L. Eyer J. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Several experimental conditions must be carefully controlled to form NF gels with reproducible viscoelastic properties. The homogenization forces must be standardized to solubilize the initial material but avoid breaking long NF polymers into fragments. Such fragments will not assemble from the first soluble extract into a sedimentable pellet after incubation with glycerol (see purification procedure) and will therefore be lost. On the other hand, the NF will remain with the membranous pellet if the homogenization strength is too low and the original NF network is not disrupted. An efficient procedure is to use an Omnimixer (for bovine spinal cords) at the lower speed (chop), five times for 15 s, at 4°C, until the homogenate is of a milk shake appearance, and noticeably more viscous than the buffer (this latter indication is of major importance for the quality of the NF preparation, since viscosity is related to the average length of NF pieces). The final NF preparation (after dialysis overnight at 4°C against buffer A, 0.8 M sucrose) should be resuspended with a hand-driven Teflon-glass homogenizer before storage. Freezing and storage of NF samples should be done in liquid nitrogen. Some loss of the NF gelation rate occurs after storage (10–20%), although it remains constant for over a year. Samples kept at −80°C do not exhibit the same stability after prolonged storage. Frozen samples must be thawed by leaving the tube on ice, without any perturbation of the sample before the complete disappearance of frozen pieces. Then, the NF suspension should be stirred on a vortex mixer at maximal speed for a controlled time: 3 times 20 s with standing in ice for 30 s. between stirring. This step disrupts any NF aggregate already formed during storage (NF interactions occur slowly in cold) and provides homogenous NF suspensions in which no gelation seed (small NF aggregate) remains. The same vigorous stirring should be applied to all NF samples mixed with other components, in order to allow the reproducibility of measurements. Avoiding any of these specific conditions will result in uncontrolled NF samples in which either no viscosity changes occur, or variable results are obtained from apparently identical samples. The nature and pH of buffers can also affect NF gelation; Tris buffers should be systematically avoided. The optimum pH for gelation is 6.5, and no gel is obtained at pH above 7.5 or under 5. Furthermore, monovalent cations inhibit gelation, which is instead stimulated by divalent cations (18Leterrier J.-L. Eyer J. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Attempts to purify rapidly crude NF from contaminant proteins by high salt (such as 1 M KCl) result in variable NF preparations which, under current incubation conditions, will remain highly fluid for very long times before sudden transformation into a nearly solid gel. 2J. F. Leterrier, unpublished observations. The presence of either glycerol or sucrose, although not strictly necessary for interactions between NF, allows the stable conformation of the polymers during long incubation periods. In our hands, the best buffer for protecting gelation properties of purified NF was buffer A made in 100% D2O, containing 0.5 M sucrose. Among sugars, sucrose was the most convenient, although a slightly different behavior of NF occurs when using a variety of other sugar species, glucose being the closest to sucrose in protecting NF gelation capacity under long time of incubation.2 After the long dialysis at 24°C needed for substantial NF dephosphorylation by phosphatases (19Eyer J. Leterrier J.F. Biochem. J. 1988; 252: 655-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), the gelation behavior of NF is slightly modified in control samples (loss of some of the gelation capacity), suggesting that minor conformational changes of the polymers occur during dialysis at 24°C. The presence of either glycerol or sucrose is an absolute requirement for protecting NF in these conditions. NF gels in buffer A were fixed for 10 min with 1% glutaraldehyde in the same buffer. Fixed samples were extensively washed with distilled water to remove buffer. Platinum/carbon replicas of rapidly frozen, freeze-dried, and fractured samples were obtained as described (29Janmey P.A. Hvidt S. Oster G.F. Lamb J. Stossel T.P. Hartwig J.H. Nature. 1990; 347: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Rhodamine N-hydroxysuccinimide ester was prepared from rhodamine B and N-hydroxysuccinimide by a standard dicyclohexylcarbodiimide coupling procedure. The three reactants were incubated at a ratio of 1:1.2:1.2 in methylene chloride for 1 h at O°C, and 20 h at 20°C. Dicyclohexylurea was filtered off, and the residue was triturated with hexane. The crude product was recrystallized from isopropanol/ether. Thin layer chromatography was performed on Merck Alufolien and gave RF = 0.565 (n-BuOH:AcOH:water, 4:1:1). NF proteins were labeled by incubating 1.6 mg/ml NF (in buffer A containing 0.4 M sucrose) for 30 min at 24°C in the presence of a 1000 times excess molar ratio of succinimidyl rhodamine B (estimated NF molecular mass 103 kDa for a 2/3/7 molar ratio of NF-H, NF-M, and NF-L). Labeled NF were recovered by centrifugation at 332,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C on a 0.8 M sucrose layer in buffer A. Pellets were resuspended in the same buffer, and aggregates were removed by centrifugation for 2 min at 15,000 × g. Observations of labeled NF were done on diluted samples (10 µg/ml) alone or mixed with 3 mg/ml unlabeled NF, using uncoated glass slides or slides precoated with 5 mg/ml casein in buffer A, sucrose 0.8 M, and washed with the same buffer. When gelation of neurofilaments was initiated by addition of 6 mM MgCl2, the elastic storage shear modulus G′ rose for 2 h following an apparent lag of a few minutes. This parameter is closely related to the extent of network formation in a polymerized system (28Janmey P.A. Hvidt S. Käs J. Lerche D. Maggs A. Sackmann E. Schliwa M. Stossel T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32503-32513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1A shows that the time course of increase in G′ for a NF gel is complex. A relatively slow increase in elasticity is followed by a more rapid rise that occurs approximately 90 min after addition of MgCl2. Similar results were obtained from more than 10 similar experiments. The structural change responsible for the increased elasticity is not polymerization of NF de novo since the intensity of light scattered from similarly treated samples did not change over this time (data not shown). Fig. 1B shows a typical free oscillation of a NF gel measured 50 min after warming a sample in a torsion pendulum. The good fit of a damped sinusoidal function to the data allows the determination of the shear moduli, and the relatively low degree of damping implies that the ratio of the loss modulus (G”) to the elastic storage modulus (G′) is small. Fig. 1C shows G′ and G” during NF gelation as measured in a Rheometrics RFS instrument by forced oscillations. The absolute value of G′ and its rate of increase are similar to those measured in the torsion pendulum, and the low value of G” relative to G′, especially at longer times is consistent with the low damping shown in Fig. 1B and with the formation of a strong elastic network. The frequency dependence of NF viscoelasticity is shown in Fig. 2. The values of G′ and G” are nearly constant over a range of deformation frequencies from 0.1 to 100 rad/s, and G′≫ G” over the entire frequency range, as expected for a material with little viscous loss. The broad plateau in shear moduli demonstrates that very few free molecular motions occur in NF gels that can dissipate mechanical energy within 0.01-10 s. These data are consistent with either a network containing very long filaments that cannot diffuse to relieve stress within this time or a network of filaments linked together by cross-links with average lifetimes greater than 10 s. Another aspect of the time-dependent viscoelasticity of NF gels is shown in Fig. 3 which depicts how the stress induced by a sudden strain to 5% relaxes in measurements made on the same sample at two different times after gel formation. When such a measurement is done 100 and 200 min after addition of MgCl2, the initial static shear moduli G(t) are 70 and 200 Pa, respectively, and consistent with the dynamic shear moduli shown in Fig. 1C. Despite the difference in magnitudes of G at these two times, the rates of stress relaxation are nearly the same, and are very nearly fit by a single exponential function that appears to decay to zero at very long, experimentally unattainable times. These results suggest that a single type of molecular response dominates the stress relaxation, and that the magnitude but not the time constant of this response changes as the overall gel strength increases. All of these features suggest that the shear modulus increases because the number of transient but long-lived interfilament contacts, or cross-links, increases, rather than that the modulus increases because of changes in filament length, concentration, or overall geometry. A common characteristic of biopolymer gels is the strong dependence of their viscoelastic properties on the amount by which they are deformed (30Janmey P.A. Hvidt S. Peetermans J. Lamb J. Ferry J.D. Stossel T.P. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8218-8227Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 31Janmey P.A. Euteneuer U. Traub P. Schliwa M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). In order to compare the mechanical properties of vimentin and NF gels, increasing degrees of steady stress (resulting in a relatively constant strain) were applied to both samples after the same incubation time. At stresses below 40 Pa, causing strains near or below 100%, a large, strain-dependent increase in G′ (strain hardening) occurs for both vimentin and NF gels (Fig. 4A), consistent with previous measurements of vimentin (31Janmey P.A. Euteneuer U. Traub P. Schliwa M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). However, the vimentin gel ceases to harden and abruptly ruptures at stresses above 50 Pa, whereas the NF gel continues to increase resistance to stresses greater than 200 Pa. The initial increase of G′ with strain is predicted to be a function of semiflexible filament networks, as increasing strain begins to pull out the slack of filaments between points of cross-linking or entanglement (32MacKintosh F. Käs J. Janmey P. Phys. Rev. Lett. 1995; 75: 4425-4428Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar), and the similar responses of NF and vimentin at low strains suggests that the basic intermediate filament structure of these proteins is similar. However, the much greater resistance of NF gels to high stresses suggests the dominant contribution of specific cross-links between NF that vimentin strands lack. The increased resistance of NF gels to increasing stresses is also shown in Fig. 4B, which depicts the resistance of a NF gel to the increasing strains applied by the Rheometrics device at a constant shear rate of 0.05/s. At strains below 4, the stress continuously increases, as expected for an elastic material, and the upward curvature of the plot confirms the strain hardening property of these networks, since the shear modulus is approximately the slope of this curve. However, once a critical strain above 5 is imposed, there is an abrupt fall in the resistance to additional strain, and the stress at constant shear rate declines to a stable value, characteristic of viscous flow, suggesting that either filament cross-links or the filaments themselves have broken. Differences between NF and vimentin gels are also evident from their slow deformations under steady shear stress (Fig. 5). Immediately after imposition of a small stress both types of gels deform to the same extent, but the NF gel quickly reaches a steady level of deformation that remains constant for a period of minutes. In contrast, the vimentin network continues to deform (creep) without limit, as reported earlier (31Janmey P.A. Euteneuer U. Traub P. Schliwa M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). This difference again suggests that cross-links between network strands dominate the rheology of NF gels, whereas the rheology of vimentin is consistent with that of a network of long intertwined filaments that have no permanent connections. Dynamic light scattering provides information about the intramolecular motions of long overlapping polymers, and this technique has been used to measure the bending stiffness of actin filaments in solution (28Janmey P.A. Hvidt S. Käs J. Lerche D. Maggs A. Sackmann E. Schliwa M. Stossel T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32503-32513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Farge E. Maggs A. Macromolecules. 1993; 26: 5041-5044Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Fig. 6 shows a qualitative comparison of intensity autocorrelation functions obtained from 0.2 mg/ml concentrations of vimentin, neurofilaments, actin filaments, and taxol-stabilized microtubules. This concentration is low enough so that NF gels containing large bundles do not form, and the scattering is presumably dominated by the thermal motions of individual polymers. Since dynamic light scattering probes molecular motions on a scale (∼10-100 nm) that is much smaller than the interfilament distance, these measurements are relatively insensitive to filament length or to the presence of interfilament cross-links. This comparison suggests that, despite their larger diameters, both vimentin and neurofilaments are more flexible than F-actin, and much more flexible than microtubules. Neurofilaments appear to be slightly stiffer than vimentin filaments, but an exact comparison is complicated by that the fact that these filament types require different solution conditions for optimal polymer formation. Preliminary quantitative measurements of vimentin networks suggest that they are approximately 10 times more flexible than actin filaments. 3A. Maggs and P. A. Janmey, unpublished data. Single rhodamine-labeled neurofilaments adherent on a glass surface appear as thin, relatively straight filaments with lengths as large as 20 µm (Fig. 7). When these filaments are imaged in solution, before adhering to the surface of the microscope cover glass, only diffuse spherical images are seen, suggesting that the single filaments in solution are so flexible that they curl into coils whose structure is not resolved by light microscopy or that intrafilament cross-links constrain them to a compact shape. In contrast, single actin filaments and microtubules in solution are easily resolved by the same methods as stiff or semiflexible rods, consistent with their greater stiffness (34Janmey P. Käs J. Saasen A. Annual Transactions of the Nordic Rheology Society. HCO Tryk, Copenhagen1994: 8Google Scholar) (data not shown). The straight images of neurofilaments seen when they adhere on a glass surface, or when a trace of fluorescent filaments co-assemble with an excess of unlabeled neurofilaments to form bundles, appear to require an unfolding of the inherently flexible filament onto the surface, and perhaps stabilization by inter-NF cross-bridging. Replicas of NF gels obtained from samples incubated for 90 min at 24°C showed two types of filament arrangements. Very long thick bundles of dense parallel arrays of NF running throughout the sample are connected to less dense NF domains in which NF polymers are linked together in a spider-web fashion (Fig. 8). Such bundling was not observed in nongelled NF, in which unoriented and unaligned wavy NF predominate (35Leterrier J.F. Wong J. Liem R.K. Shelanski M.L. J. Neurochem. 1984; 43: 1385-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Previous experiments have shown that dephosphorylation on specific sites of NF subunits affects NF interactions in opposite manners, depending on the accessibility of the phosphorylated sites to phosphatases (19Eyer J. Leterrier J.F. Biochem. J. 1988; 252: 655-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The effect"

These highly integrated cellular features play major roles in the manifold processes governing angiogenesis, in tissue remodeling following injury, and in the ability of cancerous cells to invade and metastasize (Brenner et al., 4Brenner C.A. Adler R.R. Rappolee D.A. Pedersen R.A. Werb Z. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 848-859Google Scholar; Liotta et al., 32Liotta L.A. Steeg P.A. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Cell. 1991; 64: 327-336Google Scholar; Chen, 7Chen W.-T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 802-809Google Scholar). In addition to their extensive matrix protein synthetic repertoire, cells synthesize a broad array of variably specific enzymes required for the physiologic turnover of ECM proteins within the extracellular space. Recently, considerable attention has been focused on the role of the matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) in these events, with a particular emphasis on the ability of these enzymes to facilitate tumor invasion and metastasis (Mignatti and Rifkin, 43Mignatti P. Rifkin D.B. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 161-195Google Scholar). The MMPs belong to the collagenase gene family and are characterized by secretion in latent, proenzyme form, dependence on zinc, and neutral pH for activity in the extracellular space and inhibition by the low molecular weight proteins, TIMP-1-TIMP-3 (Woessner, 59Woessner J.F. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2145-2154Google Scholar). The primary functional roles of the MMPs are generally considered to be the basal turnover of ECM proteins, including Types IV and V collagens, fibronectin, and laminin. In addition to facilitation of tumor progression, the augmented expression of MMPs in various inflammatory pathologic states, such as rheumatoid arthritis, is postulated to contribute to tissue injury, while suppression is believed to result in matrix protein accumulation and sclerosis (Kenyon, 28Kenyon K.R.

The intrinsic glomerular mesangial cell is centrally involved in both the acute inflammatory and chronic sclerotic processes characteristic of many forms of glomerular disease (Sterzel et al., 56Sterzel R.B.

We have recently demonstrated a close temporal linkage between mesangial cell activation (augmented proliferation and synthesis of ECM proteins) and the enhanced secretion of the 72-kDa gelatinase A (MMP-2) in a model of immune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis (Lovett et al., 34Lovett D.H. Johnson R.J. Marti H.-P. Martin J. Davies M. Couser W.G. Am. J. Pathol. 1992; 141: 85-98Google Scholar; Marti et al., 37Marti H.-P. Lee L. Kashgarian M. Lovett D.H. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 144: 82-94Google Scholar). The linkage between cellular activation and enhanced MMP-2 expression suggested that a primary action of this enzyme may be a direct effect upon the cells, with subsequent induction of the inflammatory phenotype. Using cultured mesangial cells, which accurately replicate the inflammatory phenotype described in vivo, we demonstrate that antisense RNA or ribozyme-mediated reduction in MMP-2 synthesis leads to the restoration of the non-inflammatory, quiescent phenotype characteristic of the normal glomerular mesangium. Furthermore, this pro-inflammatory effect of MMP-2 is dependent upon the active form of the enzyme, which we demonstrate can be produced by an autocatalytic activation process on the mesangial cell plasma membrane. The methods for the establishment, characterization, and maintenance of homogeneous cultures of rat glomerular mesangial cells have been reported in detail (Davies et al., 12Davies M. Thomas G. Martin J. Lovett D.H. Biochem. J. 1988; 251: 419-425Google Scholar; Lovett et al., 35Lovett D.H. Sterzel R.B. Kashgarian M. Ryan J.L. Kidney Int. 1983; 23: 342-349Google Scholar). The serum-free supernatants from single cell clones of rat MC were screened for high level, constitutive secretion of the 72-kDa gelatinase A (MMP-2) using a quantitative [3H]gelatin assay (Martin et al., 38Martin J.

To obtain clones in which the only gelatinolytic activity was due to MMP-2, the serum-free conditioned media were analyzed by gelatin zymography. MC plasma membrane-enriched fractions were prepared by sucrose gradient centrifugation as reported (Lovett et al., 33Lovett D.H. Szamel M. Bursten S. Martin M. Gemsa D. Resch K.

J. 1993; 291: 441-446Google Scholar) was subcloned in an antisense orientation relative to the Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat of vector pRBK. pRBK is an episomally replicating expression vector containing the human papova virus BK origin of replication, the BK large T antigen, and a hygromycin resistance cassette. MC were transfected with the antisense MMP-2 construct (pRBK-AD), or with a control pRBK vector not containing an insert, using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) as recommended by the manufacturer. After initial selection in 100 µg/ml hygromycin B, resistant colonies were selected with cloning rings, expanded, and exposed in a stepwise fashion to increasing concentrations of hygromycin (up to 250–500 µg/ml). These resistant cultures were then subjected to two cycles of single cell cloning, of which six clones were chosen for further analysis. To verify transfection and replication of the episomal vector, low molecular weight extrachromosomal DNA from controls and transfected clones was prepared according to the method of Hirt (Hirt, 24Hirt B. J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 26: 365-369Google Scholar; DeBenedetti and Rhoads, 15DeBenedetti A. Rhoads R.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1925-1931Google Scholar) and used to transform Escherichia coli XL-1 Blue to ampicillin resistance. Supercoiled plasmid added to Hirt extracts of untransfected cells was also used to transfect XL-1 Blue bacteria as a standard for determining episomal number. The retroviral vector pLNCX (Miller et al., 44Miller A.D. Miller D.G. Garcia J.V. Lynch C.M. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 217: 581-599Google Scholar), was modified by the introduction of a linker, which placed unique ApaI, NotI, BglII, MluI, and HpaI restriction enzyme sites between the existing HindIII and ClaI sites. A hammerhead ribozyme cassette was created out of two overlapping 101-mer oligonucleotides terminating in NotI and MluI cohesive ends and ligated into the NotI and MluI sites of the modified pLNCX vector to create pLNCmx2. The ribozyme cassette contained two hammerhead ribozyme sequences designed to cleave GUC nucleotide motifs within the sequences located at 974 and 1994 of the rat MMP-2 cDNA. The ribozyme cassette contained the sequences GGGGAActgatgagtccgtgaggacgaaACACATGGG, hybridizing with the GUC at nt 974, and CAGAGGAGctgatgagtccgtgaggacgaaACAGAGCC, hybridizing with the GUC at nt 1994. In each case the uppercase nucleotides represent the inverse complement of the MMP-2 mRNA, while the nucleotides in lowercase represent the hammerhead ribozyme constant region. In vitro ribozyme activity was evaluated by preparing RNA transcripts of both the ribozyme cassette and a partial length MMP-2 containing the ribozyme target sites. In order to demonstrate ribozyme catalytic activity, synthetic T7 RNA polymerase (Ambion)-produced RNA transcripts of the ribozyme sequence were synthesized and incubated with synthetic, partial length (2200 nt) MMP-2 RNA transcripts synthesized in the presence of [32P]CTP. After incubation as described by McCall et al. (40McCall M.J. Hendry P. Jennings P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5710-5714Google Scholar), RNA species were resolved on 6% polyacrylamide, 7 M urea gels and analyzed by autoradiography of the dried gels. PA317 cells were transfected with the ribozyme vector by electroporation. The medium overlying these cells was collected at 24 and 48 h after transfection, 8 µg/ml Polybrene was added and applied to subconfluent ψ-2 cells. After 48 h 800 µg/ml G418 was added and resistant clones selected and screened for virus production. Viral supernatants from the ψ-2 producer cells were used to infect subconfluent mesangial cells at a low multiplicity of infection (≈100 viruses/100-mm dish). Infected mesangial cells were subsequently selected in 800 µg/ml G418. G418-resistant colonies were pooled without further subcloning. Control MC and pRBK-AD clones were grown on etched coverslips. For staining of MMP-2 antigen, monensin (1 µM) was added for the last 3 h of culture (Marti et al., 37Marti H.-P. Lee L. Kashgarian M. Lovett D.H. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 144: 82-94Google Scholar). After fixation for 20 min with 4% paraformaldehyde, the cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, PBS and blocked with 5% goat serum in 0.1% bovine serum albumin in PBS. Cells were incubated with 5 µg/ml affinity-purified rabbit anti-MMP-2 IgG as reported (Lovett et al., 34Lovett D.H. Johnson R.J. Marti H.-P. Martin J. Davies M. Couser W.G. Am. J. Pathol. 1992; 141: 85-98Google Scholar). For detection of extracellular matrix proteins, the cells were incubated with rabbit anti-human fibronectin (1 µg of IgG/ml, Collaborative Biomedical Research), rabbit anti-mouse Type IV collagen (10 µg of IgG/ml, Collaborative Biomedical Research), or rabbit anti-Type III collagen (2.5 µg of IgG/ml, Chemicon). Biotinylated F(ab′)2 goat-anti-rabbit IgG (5 µg/ml, Zymed) was used as the secondary antibody, followed by incubation with either fluorescein- or rhodamine-conjugated streptavidin (Molecular Probes, Inc.). Mouse monoclonal anti-α-smooth muscle actin (5 µg/ml, Dako) was followed with biotinylated F(ab′)2 goat-anti-mouse IgG (5 µg/ml) and streptavidin-fluorescein. A mouse monoclonal anti-statin IgG (2 µg/ml) was kindly provided by Dr. Eugenia Wang, McGill University, Quebec, Canada. Mouse monoclonal anti-human PCNA (5 µg/ml, Dako) was followed with biotinylated F(ab′)2 goat anti-mouse IgG and streptavidin-coupled horseradish peroxidase (Vector). Pre-embedding immunoelectron microscopy using the indirect horseradish peroxidase method was performed as reported in detail (Lovett et al., 34Lovett D.H. Johnson R.J. Marti H.-P. Martin J. Davies M. Couser W.G. Am. J. Pathol. 1992; 141: 85-98Google Scholar). Control MC and a selected antisense subclone were grown on etched coverslips for 2 days in biotin-free RPMI medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum. After fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde, cells were delipidated, rehydrated, permeabilized, and blocked with avidin/biotin solutions (Vector), as reported (Pollock and Lovett, 52Pollock A.S. Lovett D.H. Biochem J. 1992; 284: 725-732Google Scholar). The cells were then prehybridized at 37°C for 30 min in hybridization solution containing 6 × SSC, 25% deionized formamide, 1 × Denhardt's solution, 200 µg/ml yeast tRNA, and 100 µg/ml salmon sperm DNA. For hybridization, 100 ng/ml Type IV α-1 collagen primer (murine sequence, nucleotides 582–606, 5′-CAACATCTCGCTTCTCTCTATGGTG-3′) was applied in the same solution and incubated at 37°C for 18 h. After a stringency wash with 1 × SSC at 55°C for 2 min, the slips were rinsed in reverse transcription buffer (50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 120 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2). Reverse transcription was carried out for 2 h at 37°C with 200 units/ml avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase in the above buffer containing 7.5 mM DTT, 100 µg/ml actinomycin-D, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP (600 µM each), 50 µM biotin-7-dATP, 0.01% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 100 units/ml placental ribonuclease inhibitor. Thereafter, the cells were washed briefly at 55°C with 0.1 × SSC and then in PBS, before they were blocked for 30 min at 25°C with 3% rabbit serum in 0.1% bovine serum albumin, PBS. Incubation with 2.5 µg/ml mouse anti-biotin IgG (Dako) for 1 h at 25°C was followed by incubation with biotinylated F(ab′)2 rabbit anti-mouse IgG (1 µg/ml, Zymed) for 2 h, and finally with fluorescein-conjugated streptavidin at 10 µg/ml. Controls included reverse transcriptions run without a specific primer, as well as sections pretreated with RNAse. MMP-2 in the latent form was purified to homogeneity from the conditioned medium of control MC according to the protocol of Okada et al. (48Okada Y. Morodomi T. Enghild J. Suzuki K. Yasui A. Nakanishi I. Nagase H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 194: 721-730Google Scholar). Subconfluent cultures of control MC and an individual antisense clone with greater than 95% reduction in MMP-2 synthesis were rinsed twice with warm PBS and incubated in a serum-free growth medium (CHO-S-SFM, Life Technologies, Inc.), which supports MC growth. Purified MMP-2 was added in concentrations ranging from 10 nM to 1 µM in either the latent or active form (generated by autocatalysis, confirmed by zymography). Controls were maintained in CHO medium alone. After 24 h all cultures were terminated by fixation. All experimental groups were evaluated by Giemsa staining for morphology, immunofluorescence staining for α-smooth muscle actin and immunoperoxidase staining for PCNA. To quantify MMP-2-dependent changes in cell phenotype, 6 random fields containing at least 100 cells each were evaluated by direct cell counting on duplicate coverslips. An additional experiment to demonstrate the specificity of MMP-2 for MC phenotypic reconstitution was performed using the closely related enzyme, MMP-9 (92-kDa gelatinase B). COS 6 M cells were transiently transfected with the human MMP-9 cDNA (gift of Dr. B. Marmer, Washington University, St. Louis, MO) cloned into the expression vector pCDM8 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). Latent MMP-9 was purified to homogeneity from the conditioned culture medium by chromatography over gelatin-Sepharose and Lens culinaris lectin-agarose (McMillan et al., 41McMillan J. Riordan J. Couser W.G. Pollock A.S. Lovett D.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1094-1101Google Scholar). MMP-9 was activated with 0.5 mM p-aminophenylmercuric acetate (confirmed by zymography), dialyzed against PBS, and added at a final concentration of 100 nM to control MC and antisense clones. Evaluation of MMP-9-treated cells was done as detailed above. Poly(A)+ RNA was prepared from MC_SF and MDA-MB231 cells by standard techniques. Double-stranded cDNA was prepared from this RNA using Superscript H− reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Both oligo(dT) and random hexamers were used to prime first strand synthesis. cDNAs were size selected by column chromatography to remove fragments ≤500 bp. Two ng of cDNA from either MC-SF or MDA-MB231 cells were used as template in a PCR reaction. The 5′ primer was GGGAAACAAATACTGGAAATTCAAC (beginning at nt 1169 of human MT-MMP, nt 1226 of rat MT-MMP); the 3′ primer contained the sequence GTTGAATTTCCAGTATTTGTTCCC (beginning 3′-5′ at nt 1580 of human MT-MMP, nt 1633 of rat MT-MMP). PCR was performed by standard techniques using Taq polymerase and a Perkin-Elmer 9600 cycler repeating 38 cycles of a 30-s denaturation step at 92°C, a 30-s annealing step at 60°C, and a 30-s extension step at 72°C. This reaction amplified a 413-base pair product in which the rat sequence is 93% homologous to the corresponding human sequence. For analytical purposes the entire PCR reaction was electrophoresed on a 1.5% agarose gel. In order to prepare a probe for Northern analysis, 10 PCR reactions using the MDA-MB231 RNA as template were combined and resolved on 1% low melting temperature agarose gel. The 413-bp ethidium bromide-stained band was identified and excised, and the DNA recovered using β-agarase. Two µg of poly(A)+ RNA from MDA-MB231 cells and 20 µg of poly(A)+ RNA from MC-SF were electrophoresed in a 1% agarose, 2.2 M formaldehyde gel. RNA was capillary transferred to Hybond N+ and fixed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Twenty-five ng of the PCR-derived probe were labeled with [32P]dCTP and hybridized overnight at 65°C in 6 × SSC, 1% SDS, 100 µg/ml sheared salmon sperm DNA, 10% dextran sulfate. The blot was washed at 55°C in 0.1 × SSC, 1% SDS for 1 h and exposed to XAR film using two intensifying screens. Zymographic analysis of MC_SF and MDA-MB231 plasma membrane fractions was performed to determine the presence or absence of actual MT-MMP enzymatic activity in these respective preparations. Plasma membrane-enriched fractions from each cell type were prepared and characterized as detailed (Lovett et al., 33Lovett D.H. Szamel M. Bursten S. Martin M. Gemsa D. Resch K. Kidney Int. 1987; 34: 26-35Google Scholar). In addition, 50-µg aliquots of membrane fractions were analyzed for the physical associations of MMP-2 and MT-MMP activities using: 1) salt extraction in 1 M potassium acetate, pH 8.0, for 15 min at 4°C; 2) acid stripping in 50 mM glycine, 0.1 M NaCl, pH 3.0, for 3 min at 4°C; and 3) detergent extraction in which membranes were incubated in 1% Triton X-114/PBS for 5 min at 4°C, centrifuged, and warmed to 37°C to permit phase separation. The Triton X-114 phase was recovered and analyzed by zymography. The kinetic and inhibition patterns of MMP-2 activation were compared using purified fluid phase MMP-2 and plasma membrane-associated enzyme. Sucrose density gradient purified MC_SF plasma membrane fractions were prepared as detailed above. Fifty-µg aliquots of plasma membrane preparations, which contained 170 ng (0.25 nmol) of MMP-2 protein by quantitative assay, were incubated at 37°C for increasing time periods in 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Thereafter, the materials were analyzed by gelatin zymography as detailed above. Parallel incubations were performed with the same concentration of purified fluid phase MMP-2, with subsequent zymographic analysis. The extent of conversion of the 72-kDa MMP-2 precursor to the 66-kDa activated form was quantified by densitometric analysis of the zymographic gels. Inhibition studies of the membrane-associated MMP-2 activation process were performed by the inclusion of 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM 1,10-phenanthrolene, or 5 µg of recombinant human TIMP-1 (the gift of Dr. Gillian Murphy, Strangeways Research Laboratory, Cambridge, United Kingdom) in the incubation mixture, followed by zymographic analysis. Cultured rat glomerular mesangial cells were subjected to sequential rounds of cloning to identify populations with high level, constitutive expression of a single matrix metalloproteinase, the 72-kDa gelatinase A (MMP-2). Constitutive secretion of the 72-kDa gelatinase enzyme into the culture medium from a selected MC clone, MC_SF, was 2.2 µg/24 h/100 µg of cellular protein, and this clone was similar to the other clones selected in all characteristics. In addition to high levels of secreted enzyme, these cells expressed large amounts of the enzyme on the cell surface. Quantitative determination of sucrose density gradient-prepared plasma membrane-enriched fractions revealed 340 ng of MMP-2/100 µg of membrane protein. In both the case of the secreted and membrane-associated enzyme, greater than 95% of the MMP-2 was present in the latent form. Indirect immunoperoxidase electron microscopic analysis revealed a distinct pattern of mesangial cell surface MMP-2 staining, with prominent staining on the leading edges and extended filopodial processes (Fig. 1). Clone MC_SF was transfected with the episomally replicating pRBK vector, which contained the rat MMP-2 cDNA (bp 25-2299) in an antisense orientation (vector pRBK-AD). Controls included MC stably transfected with the pRBK vector alone (denoted MC-φ). Hygromycin-resistant colonies were subjected to stepwise increments in hygromycin concentration in order to maximize episome numbers, after which the colonies were further segregated by two rounds of single-cell cloning. Episomal replication of the antisense vector was verified by transfection of E. coli with low molecular weight Hirt DNA extracts of antisense clones and counting of ampicillin-resistant bacterial colonies. Simultaneous addition of pure supercoiled pRBK-AD plasmid DNA to Hirt extracts of untransfected cells were used as a standard to determine that highly suppressed antisense clones maintained greater than 500 episomal copies/cell. Supernatant levels of MMP-2 activity in multiple individual clones were measured and revealed suppression of the secreted enzyme ranging from 37% to greater than 95% (Fig. 6). Histochemical staining of these individual clones demonstrated a marked decrease in cell-associated MMP-2 antigen as compared to controls (Fig. 2, panels a and b).Fig. 2Immunohistochemical staining for MMP-2 and growth patterns in 72-kDa antisense-RNA transfected cells. Upper panels, MMP-2 antisense-transfected clones (b) show a significant decrease in cell-associated MMP-2 as compared to controls (a). Middle panels, higher magnification double exposure (epifluorescence and Nomarski optics) reveals MMP-2 concentrated along the plasma membranes of the prominent lamellopodia of control MC-φ (c). MMP-2 antisense clones appear as rounded, non-motile cells with minimal plasma membrane staining for MMP-2 (d). Lower panels, cells were stained with hematoxylin. Control MC grow as randomly distributed, motile cells with prominent elongation (e), whereas MMP-2 antisense cells grow in tight clusters of larger, rounded cells (f). Final magnification for a, b, e, and f, ×900; for c and d, ×3600.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Analysis of the antisense-bearing clones revealed several distinguishing features. Control MC-φ cells exhibited the typical morphologic features of the activated mesangial phenotype (Bursten et al., 5Bursten S.L. Stevenson F. Torrano F. Lovett D.H. Am. J. Pathol. 1991; 139: 371-382Google Scholar), with elongation and prominent lamellopodia at the leading edges of these migratory cells. Directly corresponding with the immunoelectron microscopic studies, there was a notable concentration of MMP-2 staining along the bases of these lamellopodial extensions (Fig. 2, panel c). In contrast, the highly suppressed MMP-2 antisense clones contained large numbers of rounded, non-motile cells, with minimal or no surface staining for the MMP-2 antigen (Fig. 2, panel d). Quantitative analysis of membrane MMP-2 activities confirmed the impressions given by immunofluorescence staining, with reductions to less than 14 ng/100 µg of membrane protein. The growth patterns of the highly suppressed MMP-2 antisense clones were distinctive when compared to the control MC-φ. Sparsely plated cultures of control MC-φ consisted of randomly distributed individual cells, with prominent elongation and minimal cellular contacts (Fig. 2, panel e). The cells of the various MMP-2 antisense clones were considerably larger, rounded, and present in tight clusters evidencing multiple cellular contacts at all degrees of confluence (Fig. 2, panel f). The normally quiescent cells of the glomerular mesangium do not express the α variant of smooth muscle cell actin; however, in a number of diseases characterized by mesangial proliferation, α-actin is synthesized at high levels by the intrinsic mesangial cells (Johnson et al., 26Johnson R.J. Iida H. Alpers C. Majesky M. Schwartz S.M. Pritzl P. Gordon K. Gown A. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 847-858Google Scholar; Elger et al., 18Elger M. Drenckhahn D. Nobiling R. Mundel P. Kriz W. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 142: 497-509Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical staining of the rapidly proliferating control MC-φ demonstrated intense cellular staining for α-actin (Fig. 3, panel a), consistent with the activated nature of these cells, while there was virtually no detectable α-actin within the MMP-2 antisense clones (Fig. 3, panel b). This points to the return to a quiescent state, which occurs even in the continued presence of the growth stimulatory factors present in the culture medium. The extracellular matrix protein synthetic profiles of cultured, proliferating rat MC have been extensively characterized and are typified by a preferential synthesis of interstitial collagens (Types I and III), minimal synthesis of Type IV collagen, and abundant cell surface-associated fibronectin (Ishimura e"
https://openalex.org/W2041465863,"In this report, we describe an auto-regulatory loop in human keratinocytes, whereby all-trans retinoic acid (retinoic acid) regulates its own biosynthesis from all-trans retinol (retinol) through regulation of retinol esterification. Retinol esterification activity was low in normal proliferating human keratinocytes, cultured in retinoid-free media. Treatment of keratinocytes with retinoic acid induced retinol esterifying activity (8-fold). Induction of retinol esterifying activity was blocked by either actinomycin D or cycloheximide. Based on substrate specificity and inhibitor sensitivity, lecithin:retinol acyltransferase (LRAT) was identified as the retinoic acid-inducible retinol esterifying enzyme. Induction of LRAT by retinoic acid reduced conversion of retinol to retinoic acid by 50%. This reduction in retinoic acid synthesis resulted from sequestration of retinol as retinyl esters, since inhibition of LRAT restored retinoic acid synthesis to control levels. In normal human skin, undifferentiated keratinocytes, in the lowest cell layer, esterified retinol 4 times greater, than differentiating keratinocytes, in upper cell layers, reflecting an induced state, under conditions of retinol sufficiency. Regulation of LRAT activity by retinoic acid provides a novel mechanism through which retinoic acid can regulate its own level by controlling availability of retinol for conversion to retinoic acid. In human skin in vivo, retinyl esters synthesized in basal keratinocytes could undergo hydrolysis during differentiation and thus serve as a source of retinol for keratinocytes in upper layers of skin.

https://openalex.org/W1968883066,"The current study utilizes human, apoE-free high density lipoprotein reconstituted with a highly specific fluorescent-cholesteryl ester probe to define the initial steps and regulatory sites associated with the uptake and intracellular itinerary of lipoprotein-derived cholesteryl esters. Bt2cAMP-stimulated ovarian granulosa cells were used as the experimental model, and both morphological and biochemical fluorescence data were obtained. The data show that cholesteryl ester provided through the selective pathway is a process which begins with a temperature-independent transfer of cholesteryl ester to the cell's plasma membrane. Thereafter transfer of the lipid proceeds rapidly and accumulates prominently in a perinuclear region (presumed to be the Golgi/membrane sorting compartment) and in lipid storage droplets of the cells. The data suggest that lipid transfer proteins (or other small soluble proteins) are not required for the intracellular transport of the cholesteryl esters, nor is an intact Golgi complex or an intact cell cytoskeleton (although the transfer is less efficient in the presence of certain microtubule-disrupting agents). The intracellular transfer of the cholesteryl esters is also somewhat dependent on an energy source in that a glucose-deficient culture medium or a combination of metabolic inhibitors reduces the efficiency of the transfer. A protein-mediated event may be required for cholesteryl ester internalization from the plasma membrane, in that N-ethylmaleimide dramatically blocks the internalization phase of the selective uptake process. Taken together these data suggest that the selective pathway is a factor-dependent, energy-requiring cholesteryl ester transport system, in which lipoprotein-donated cholesteryl esters probably flow through vesicles or intracellular membrane sheets and their connections, rather than through the cell cytosol."
https://openalex.org/W2028763835,"To investigate the role of human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) in the maintenance and remodeling of the extracellular matrix, we evaluated the expression by HBECs of 72- and 92-kDa gelatinases under basal conditions and after exposure to bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Confluent HBECs from explants were cultured in plastic dishes coated with type I and III collagens. Gelatin zymography of HBEC-conditioned media showed constitutive major 92-kDa and minor 72-kDa gelatinases recognized by specific human antibodies and totally inhibited by the metalloproteinase inhibitor EDTA. The identification of the two matrix metalloproteinases was confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Identical patterns of gelatinase expression were observed with repetitive primary cultures issued from the same explants. Zymography showed that exposure of HBECs to LPS induced 2- and 20-fold increases in 92-kDa gelatinase production and activation, respectively, as well as a smaller increase in activated 68-kDa gelatinase. With [3H]gelatin substrate, elevated metallogelatinolytic activity (138 µg of hydrolyzed gelatin/48 h/106 cells) was also observed, whereas no activity was detected in the absence of LPS. A human epithelial cell line (16HBE14o−) exhibited the same basal profile of gelatinase activity, but this profile remained unchanged after exposure to LPS. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction demonstrated only minimal changes in 92-kDa mRNA levels in response to LPS, but the half-life of 92-kDa gelatinase mRNA was increased with exposure to LPS. In contrast, concomitant slight increases in 72-kDa gelatinase protein and mRNA were found, suggesting that the control mechanisms regulating the expression of 92- and 72-kDa gelatinases by HBECs in response to LPS are divergent. All these data allowed us to propose that HBECs may be actively involved in the physiological and physiopathological remodeling of the airway basement membrane.

https://openalex.org/W2014698177,"Regulation of calcium transport by sarcoplasmic reticulum provides increased cardiac contractility in response to β-adrenergic stimulation. This is due to phosphorylation of phospholamban by cAMP-dependent protein kinase or by calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, which activates the calcium pump (Ca2+-ATPase). Recently, direct phosphorylation of Ca2+-ATPase by calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase has been proposed to provide additional regulation. To investigate these effects in detail, we have purified Ca2+-ATPase from cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum using affinity chromatography and reconstituted it with purified, recombinant phospholamban. The resulting proteoliposomes had high rates of calcium transport, which was tightly coupled to ATP hydrolysis (∼1.7 calcium ions transported per ATP molecule hydrolyzed). Co-reconstitution with phospholamban suppressed both calcium uptake and ATPase activities by ∼50%, and this suppression was fully relieved by a phospholamban monoclonal antibody or by phosphorylation either with cAMP-dependent protein kinase or with calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase. These effects were consistent with a change in the apparent calcium affinity of Ca2+-ATPase and not with a change in Vmax. Neither the purified, reconstituted cardiac Ca2+-ATPase nor the Ca2+-ATPase in longitudinal cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles was a substrate for calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, and accordingly, we found no effect of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation on Vmax for calcium transport.

Neither the purified, reconstituted cardiac Ca2+-ATPase nor the Ca2+-ATPase in longitudinal cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles was a substrate for calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, and accordingly, we found no effect of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation on Vmax for calcium transport."

The signal transduction cascades initiated by IL-10 ligation to its cognate receptor remain to be elucidated. Here, we demonstrate that in both primary monocytes and the D36 cell line, IL-10 rapidly and transiently stimulated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity associated with the p85 subunit of the enzyme. IL-10 also activated p70 S6 kinase in both cell types. The activation of both of these kinases was sensitive to wortmannin, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. The activation of p70 S6 kinase was also inhibited by the immunosuppressive drug rapamycin. Both rapamycin and wortmannin inhibited the IL-10-induced proliferation of D36 cells but in contrast had no effect on the antiinflammatory effects of the cytokine on lipopolysaccharide-stimulated monocytes. Similar results on D36 proliferation and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated monocyte inhibition by IL-10 were obtained with another phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor, LY294002. This suggests that the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and p70 S6 kinase is involved in the proliferative functions of IL-10 and that other as yet uncharacterized pathways affect the suppressive effects on monocytes, indicating that multiple and distinct signaling pathways mediate the various pleiotropic activities of IL-10. Furthermore, these findings suggest that it may be possible in the future to modulate the antiinflammatory effects of IL-10 for therapeutic benefit without disrupting other functions of the cytokine.

INTRODUCTIONThe φX-type primosome was identified initially as being required during the first stage of φX174 bacteriophage DNA replication, providing the priming activity for complementary strand DNA synthesis (1Wickner S.

It has thus been suggested that the φX-type primosome is active at the Escherichia coli replication fork (7Wu C.A. Zechner E.L. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4030-4044Google Scholar). Additionally, recent genetic evidence has suggested its participation in DNA repair and recombination (8Sandler S.J. Samra H.S. Clark A.J. Genetics. 1996; 143: 5-13Google Scholar, 9Sandler S.J. Mol.

Lark K.G. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 136: 1008-1017Google Scholar, 12Lark K.G. Lark C.A. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1978; 43: 537-549Google Scholar, 13Masai H. Bond M.W. Arai K. Proc. Natl. Acad.

CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 17: 153-215Google Scholar). They are PriA, PriB, PriC, DnaB, DnaC, DnaG, DnaT, and SSB (1Wickner S. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 4120-4124Google Scholar, 2Weiner J. McMacken R. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 752-756Google Scholar, 5Lee M.S. Marians K.J. J. Biol.

Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5273-5280Google Scholar). On an SSB-coated φX174 phage DNA, the PAS, which has a hairpin-like structure (20Shlomai J. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 799-803Google Scholar), is exposed. A preprimosome is formed by the concerted action of PriA, PriB, PriC, DnaB, DnaC, and DnaT. The preprimosome is capable of translocating bidirectionally along single-stranded DNA (5Lee M.S. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14531-14542Google Scholar) displacing SSB in the process (19Arai K. Low R. Kobori J. Shlomai J. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5273-5280Google Scholar), as well as acting as a bidirectional DNA helicase (5Lee M.S. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14531-14542Google Scholar). An important feature of the preprimosome is its ability to attract DnaG, enabling it to synthesize primers for complementary strand synthesis, via a functional interaction with at least one primosomal protein, DnaB (21Tougu K. Peng H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4675-4682Google Scholar).The roles of some of the primosomal proteins in primosome assembly and subsequent replication are more apparent than others. PriA specifically recognizes the PAS as evident from the hyperstimulation of its ATPase by that DNA sequence (20Shlomai J. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 799-803Google Scholar, 22Wickner S. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 3342-3346Google Scholar). It can be viewed as the recognition factor for the site of primosome assembly. In addition, its 3′→ 5′ helicase activity (23Lee M.S. Marians K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8345-8349Google Scholar, 24Lasken R.S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5512-5518Google Scholar) probably accounts for the translocation of the preprimosome in the same direction (5Lee M.S. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14531-14542Google Scholar). DnaB, a 5′→ 3′ helicase (25LeBowitz J. McMacken R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4738-4748Google Scholar), is likely responsible for the 5′→ 3′ translocation activity of the preprimosome (5Lee M.S. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14531-14542Google Scholar) and the interaction with primase during primer synthesis (21Tougu K. Peng H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4675-4682Google Scholar). DnaC forms a complex in solution with DnaB that facilitates binding of DnaB to DNA (26Wickner S. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 921-925Google Scholar, 27Kobori J.A. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13770-13775Google Scholar, 28Wahle E. Lasken R.S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2463-2468Google Scholar, 29Wahle E. Lasken R.S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2469-2475Google Scholar). On the other hand, the lack of information on the enzymatic nature of PriB, PriC, and DnaT provides few clues to their functions in the assembly process. Although various efforts have been made to determine the composition of an active φX-type primosome, the evidence accrued has been mostly indirect, relying on detecting the biochemical activities of the proteins involved (18Allen Jr., G.C. Kornberg A. J. Biol Chem. 1993; 268: 19204-19209Google Scholar, 19Arai K. Low R. Kobori J. Shlomai J. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5273-5280Google Scholar, 20Shlomai J. Kornberg A. Proc.

A. 1981; 78: 1436-1440Google Scholar). Questions remain as to (i) how and in what order the φX-type primosome is assembled, (ii) which primosomal proteins stably associate with the PAS during assembly, and (iii) whether the composition of the primosome changes as it makes the transition from assembly to complementary strand DNA synthesis.In order to resolve these issues, we examined the assembly process and subsequent complementary strand synthesis in a stepwise fashion. Ambiguity was minimized by physical detection of the primosomal proteins involved. In this report, the first two questions are addressed. We demonstrate the stepwise assembly of the primosome using gel mobility shift analysis to isolate intermediate complexes coupled with physical detection of the primosomal proteins present in these complexes. A model of ordered primosomal assembly is proposed. The accompanying articles describe studies on the composition of the primosome from assembly through replication (31Ng J.Y. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15649-15655Google Scholar), and the role of PriB during primosome assembly (32Liu J. Nurse P. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15656-15661Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONAlthough the φX-type primosome was first characterized during the analysis of the replication of an E. coli phage, its normal cellular functions are closely tied to the well being and survival of the bacterium. Mutational analysis has lent insight to the significance of the primosomal proteins. Conditional-lethal mutations in dnaB, dnaC, dnaG, and dnaT that cease DNA replication at the nonpermissive temperature have been identified, a clear sign of their indispensable involvement in the chromosomal replication machinery. priA disruption mutants were viable but manifested partial induction of the SOS response, UV sensitivity, and inefficiencies in recombination, plasmid replication, cell growth, and cell division (41Nurse P. Zavitz K.H. Marians K.J. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6686-6693Google Scholar, 42Lee E.H. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3029-3032Google Scholar). This has led to several models proposing that the φX-type primosome provides the helicase and primase activities at the E. coli replication fork (41Nurse P. Zavitz K.H. Marians K.J. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6686-6693Google Scholar, 43Zavitz K.H. Marians K.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 2869-2873Google Scholar, 44Allen G.C. Dixon N.E. Kornberg A. Cell. 1993; 74: 713-722Google Scholar).The phenotypes of the priA disruption mutants were also informative in providing clues to other possible functions of PriA and the φX-type primosome in E. coli. Recent studies have shown that the primosome assembly function of PriA was essential for DNA repair and recombination (8Sandler S.J. Samra H.S. Clark A.J. Genetics. 1996; 143: 5-13Google Scholar, 9Sandler S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 871-880Google Scholar, 10Kogoma T. Cadwell G.W. Barnard K.G. Asai T. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1258-1264Google Scholar). Compelling genetic data pointed to the participation of PriA, DnaC, and DnaT in inducible, as well as constitutive stable DNA replication (10Kogoma T. Cadwell G.W. Barnard K.G. Asai T. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1258-1264Google Scholar, 11Lark C.A. Riazi J. Lark K.G. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 136: 1008-1017Google Scholar, 12Lark K.G. Lark C.A. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1978; 43: 537-549Google Scholar, 13Masai H. Bond M.W. Arai K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1256-1260Google Scholar, 14Masai H. Arai K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15083-15093Google Scholar, 15Masai H. Asai T. Kubota Y. Arai K. Kogoma T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5338-5345Google Scholar), which are alternative pathways of DNA replication activated during stress. It has also been suggested that φX-type primosome activity was required for resolution of recombination intermediates that arise during double-strand break repair (45Asai T. Kogoma T. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1807-1812Google Scholar). We therefore set out to develop a clear picture of the mechanism of primosome assembly. A gel mobility shift protocol was designed and optimized to isolate and resolve intermediates in primosome assembly. The identity of primosomal proteins present in each complex was then determined using specific antibodies and a highly sensitive immunoblotting technique. Our interpretation of the results is summarized in a model of ordered φX primosome assembly (Fig. 7) and is discussed below.When primosomal proteins were tested individually for their ability to bind to PAS304, only PriA showed affinity for the DNA. DnaB could also form a complex with PAS304 in the presence of DnaC and ATP. However, this represented the previously established ability of DnaB to bind SSB-free single-stranded DNA (38Arai K. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5253-5259Google Scholar). In fact, no equivalent of a BC complex could be detected when the gel shift assays were repeated with SSB-coated PAS304 (data not shown). Thus, it seems likely that PriA is the recognition factor in φX primosome assembly (Fig. 7, step a). Nevertheless, the role of PriA is not limited to recognizing and binding to the PAS. The PriA-PAS interaction clearly induces the binding of other primosomal proteins, at least one of which, PriB, in turn stabilizes the PriA-PAS interaction. As described in the accompanying manuscript by Liu et al. (32Liu J. Nurse P. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15656-15661Google Scholar), the PriB-PriA interaction results in a decreased off rate for PriA from the PAS.Under typical reaction conditions, the PriA-PriB complex is likely the precursor of the PriA-PriB-DnaT complex (Fig. 7, step b). Evidence is presented in an accompanying article (32Liu J. Nurse P. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15656-15661Google Scholar) that whereas DnaT can associate with PriA on the DNA, the concentration of DnaT required is lowered by a factor of 10 in the presence of PriB. PriB may also stabilize the preprimosomal complexes by virtue of its interaction with SSB. This has been suggested previously (46Low R.L. Shlomai J. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6242-6250Google Scholar) and is discussed in the accompanying manuscript by Ng and Marians (31Ng J.Y. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15649-15655Google Scholar).The final step in preprimosome assembly is the addition of DnaB from a DnaB-DnaC complex in solution to the PriA-PriB-DnaT-PAS complex (Fig. 7, step c). This step requires ATP hydrolysis. Presumably, as suggested by Wahle and Kornberg (28Wahle E. Lasken R.S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2463-2468Google Scholar, 29Wahle E. Lasken R.S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2469-2475Google Scholar), it is actually DnaC that hydrolyzes the ATP and not DnaB. This would be consistent with the view (because DnaC is not found in any of the primosomal protein-DNA complexes) that DnaC is acting as a DnaB-specific chaperon-like protein during primosome assembly, facilitating the interaction of DnaB with at least one of the proteins in the PriA-PriB-DnaT complex.Thus, under the reaction conditions described here, a preprimosomal complex is composed of PriA, PriB, DnaT, and DnaB. Because only PriA out of this group binds DNA, it seems clear that formation of the PriA-PriB-DnaT-PAS complex requires specific protein-protein interactions: interaction of PriB with PriA and interaction of DnaT with either PriA or PriB. Association of DnaB with this complex could be a result of either an additional specific protein-protein interaction or a PriA-PriB-DnaT-induced stabilization of DnaB bound to single-stranded DNA in very close proximity to the existing primosomal protein-DNA complex.In the studies reported here, PriC had no effect on primosomal complex formation and could not be found in any of the protein-DNA complexes. PriC stimulation in vitro of the complementary strand synthesis step of the φX174 viral life cycle is variable. Currently, in our hands, using recombinant proteins (that are known not to be cross-contaminated with PriC based on ECL-Western analysis), purified from overexpression strains, PriC stimulates the replication assay by only 2- or 3-fold. This suggests that PriC may be a stability or specificity factor whose role was more prominent during the early stages of the study of primosome mechanism, when the primosomal proteins were both less pure and less concentrated. This is consistent with the observations, reported in the accompanying article (31Ng J.Y. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15649-15655Google Scholar), that PriC is present in the preprimosomal complex when it assembles on full-length bacteriophage DNA, where there is a huge excess of nonspecific DNA present in the assembly reaction.Our current findings correlate well with our previous report on the assembly steps required to generate a bidirectional helicase complex in the presence of the primosomal proteins (5Lee M.S. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14531-14542Google Scholar). Our findings differ from previous reports based on detection of individual proteins by indirect biochemical assays (18Allen Jr., G.C. Kornberg A. J. Biol Chem. 1993; 268: 19204-19209Google Scholar, 47Arai K. McMacken R. Yasuda S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5281-5286Google Scholar) in that we demonstrate the existence of a PriA-PriB complex and a PriA-PriB-DnaT complex and show that DnaT clearly remains associated with the preprimosome. Consistent with previous reports (1Wickner S. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 4120-4124Google Scholar, 2Weiner J. McMacken R. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 752-756Google Scholar) and with the transient nature of its interaction with DnaB (21Tougu K. Peng H. Marians K.J. J. Biol.

INTRODUCTIONThe φX-type primosome was identified initially as being required during the first stage of φX174 bacteriophage DNA replication, providing the priming activity for complementary strand DNA synthesis (1Wickner S. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 4120-4124Google Scholar, 2Weiner J. McMacken R. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 752-756Google Scholar). Subsequent studies showed that the primosome was (i) capable of translocation and primer synthesis along single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB) 1The abbreviations used are: SSBthe E. coli single-stranded DNA-binding proteinPASprimosome assembly sitePA-sthe PriA-slow complexPA-fthe PriA-fast complexPA·PB-sthe PriA-PriB-slow complexPA·PB-fthe PriA-PriB-fast complexPA·PB·Tthe PriA-PriB-DnaT complexBCthe DnaB-DnaC complexECLenhanced chemiluminescenceAMP-PNP5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate. -coated single-stranded DNA (3Arai K.

A. 1981; 78: 707-711Google Scholar), (ii) a bidirectional DNA helicase (5Lee M.S. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14531-14542Google Scholar), and (iii) capable of providing the DNA helicase and Okazaki fragment-priming activities at replication forks reconstituted with purified proteins (6Mok M. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2304-2309Google Scholar, 7Wu C.A. Zechner E.L. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4030-4044Google Scholar). It has thus been suggested that the φX-type primosome is active at the Escherichia coli replication fork (7Wu C.A. Zechner E.L. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4030-4044Google Scholar). Additionally, recent genetic evidence has suggested its participation in DNA repair and recombination (8Sandler S.J. Samra H.S. Clark A.J. Genetics. 1996; 143: 5-13Google Scholar, 9Sandler S.J. Mol.

Lark K.G. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 136: 1008-1017Google Scholar, 12Lark K.G. Lark C.A. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1978; 43: 537-549Google Scholar, 13Masai H. Bond M.W. Arai K. Proc. Natl. Acad.

CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 17: 153-215Google Scholar). They are PriA, PriB, PriC, DnaB, DnaC, DnaG, DnaT, and SSB (1Wickner S. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 4120-4124Google Scholar, 2Weiner J. McMacken R. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 752-756Google Scholar, 5Lee M.S. Marians K.J. J. Biol.

Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5273-5280Google Scholar). On an SSB-coated φX174 phage DNA, the PAS, which has a hairpin-like structure (20Shlomai J. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 799-803Google Scholar), is exposed. A preprimosome is formed by the concerted action of PriA, PriB, PriC, DnaB, DnaC, and DnaT. The preprimosome is capable of translocating bidirectionally along single-stranded DNA (5Lee M.S. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14531-14542Google Scholar) displacing SSB in the process (19Arai K. Low R. Kobori J. Shlomai J. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5273-5280Google Scholar), as well as acting as a bidirectional DNA helicase (5Lee M.S. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14531-14542Google Scholar). An important feature of the preprimosome is its ability to attract DnaG, enabling it to synthesize primers for complementary strand synthesis, via a functional interaction with at least one primosomal protein, DnaB (21Tougu K. Peng H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4675-4682Google Scholar).The roles of some of the primosomal proteins in primosome assembly and subsequent replication are more apparent than others. PriA specifically recognizes the PAS as evident from the hyperstimulation of its ATPase by that DNA sequence (20Shlomai J. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 799-803Google Scholar, 22Wickner S. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 3342-3346Google Scholar). It can be viewed as the recognition factor for the site of primosome assembly. In addition, its 3′→ 5′ helicase activity (23Lee M.S. Marians K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8345-8349Google Scholar, 24Lasken R.S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5512-5518Google Scholar) probably accounts for the translocation of the preprimosome in the same direction (5Lee M.S. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14531-14542Google Scholar). DnaB, a 5′→ 3′ helicase (25LeBowitz J. McMacken R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4738-4748Google Scholar), is likely responsible for the 5′→ 3′ translocation activity of the preprimosome (5Lee M.S. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14531-14542Google Scholar) and the interaction with primase during primer synthesis (21Tougu K. Peng H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4675-4682Google Scholar). DnaC forms a complex in solution with DnaB that facilitates binding of DnaB to DNA (26Wickner S. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 921-925Google Scholar, 27Kobori J.A. Kornberg A.

Chem. 1989; 264: 2469-2475Google Scholar). On the other hand, the lack of information on the enzymatic nature of PriB, PriC, and DnaT provides few clues to their functions in the assembly process. Although various efforts have been made to determine the composition of an active φX-type primosome, the evidence accrued has been mostly indirect, relying on detecting the biochemical activities of the proteins involved (18Allen Jr., G.C. Kornberg A. J. Biol Chem. 1993; 268: 19204-19209Google Scholar, 19Arai K. Low R. Kobori J. Shlomai J. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5273-5280Google Scholar, 20Shlomai J. Kornberg A. Proc.

A. 1981; 78: 1436-1440Google Scholar). Questions remain as to (i) how and in what order the φX-type primosome is assembled, (ii) which primosomal proteins stably associate with the PAS during assembly, and (iii) whether the composition of the primosome changes as it makes the transition from assembly to complementary strand DNA synthesis.In order to resolve these issues, we examined the assembly process and subsequent complementary strand synthesis in a stepwise fashion. Ambiguity was minimized by physical detection of the primosomal proteins involved. In this report, the first two questions are addressed. We demonstrate the stepwise assembly of the primosome using gel mobility shift analysis to isolate intermediate complexes coupled with physical detection of the primosomal proteins present in these complexes. A model of ordered primosomal assembly is proposed. The accompanying articles describe studies on the composition of the primosome from assembly through replication (31Ng J.Y. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15649-15655Google Scholar), and the role of PriB during primosome assembly (32Liu J. Nurse P. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15656-15661Google Scholar)."
https://openalex.org/W2023378571,"We demonstrate a critical role for Asn102 of the human gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor in the binding of GnRH. Mutation of Asn102, located at the top of the second transmembrane helix, to Ala resulted in a 225-fold loss of potency for GnRH. Eight GnRH analogs, all containing glycinamide C termini like GnRH, showed similar losses of potency between 95- and 750-fold for the [Ala102]GnRHR, compared with wild-type receptor. In contrast, four GnRH analogs that had ethylamide in place of the C-terminal glycinamide residue, showed much smaller decreases in potency between 2.4- and 11-fold. In comparisons of three agonist pairs, differing only at the C terminus, glycinamide derivatives showed an 11–20-fold greater loss of potency for the mutant receptor than their respective ethylamide derivatives. Thus Asn102 is a critical determinant of potency specifically for ligands with C-terminal glycinamide, while ligands with C-terminal ethylamide are less dependent on Asn102. These findings indicate a role for Asn102 in the docking of the glycinamide C terminus and are consistent with hydrogen bonding of the Asn102 side chain with the C-terminal amide moiety. Taken with previous data, they suggest a region of the GnRH receptor formed by the top of helices 2 and 7 as a binding pocket for the C-terminal part of the ligand.

https://openalex.org/W2020947886,"Presteady-state and steady-state kinetic studies performed on human glutathione transferase P1-1 (EC) with 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene as co-substrate indicate that the rate-determining step is a physical event that occurs after binding of the two substrates and before the σ-complex formation. It may be a structural transition involving the ternary complex. This event can be related to diffusion-controlled motions of protein portions as k°cat/kcat linearly increases by raising the relative viscosity of the solution. Similar viscosity dependence has been observed for KGSHm, while KCDNBm is independent. No change of the enzyme structure by viscosogen has been found by circular dichroism analysis. Thus, kcat and KGSHm seem to be related to the frequency and extent of enzyme structural motions modulated by viscosity. Interestingly, the reactivity of Cys-47 which can act as a probe for the flexibility of helix 2 is also modulated by viscosity. Its viscosity dependence parallels that observed for kcat and KGSHm, thereby suggesting a possible correlation between kcat, KGSHm, and diffusion-controlled motion of helix 2. The viscosity effect on the kinetic parameters of C47S and C47S/C101S mutants confirms the involvement of helix 2 motions in the modulation of KGSHm, whereas a similar role on kcat cannot be ascertained unequivocally. The flexibility of helix 2 modulates also the homotropic behavior of GSH in these mutants. Furthermore, fluorescence experiments support a structural motion of about 4 Å occurring between helix 2 and helix 4 when GSH binds to the G-site.

(EC) is a dimeric enzyme composed of two identical subunits each containing one binding site for GSH (G-site) and a second binding site for the electrophilic co-substrate (H-site). Inspection of the three-dimensional structure indicates the presence near the G-site of the irregular α helix 2 (residues 37–46) which is exposed to the solvent (1Reinemer P. Dirr H.W. Ladenstein R. Huber R. Lo Bello M. Federici G. Parker M.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 214-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Lys-44, a part of this helix, is involved in the binding of GSH. At the end of helix 2 is Cys-47 which is probably linked by ion pair formation with Lys-54. This electrostatic interaction seems important for the correct spatial arrangement of the G-site (2Lo Bello M. Parker M.W. Desideri A. Polticelli F. Falconi M. Del Boccio G. Pennelli A. Federici G.

We therefore suggested that Cys-47 acts as a hinge which limits the extent or frequency of conformational transitions involving helix 2 (3Ricci G. Lo Bello M. Caccuri A.M. Pastore A. Nuccetelli M.

In its absence, helix 2 would become more flexible and contact the adjacent subunit via helix 4 thereby inducing the observed cooperativity (4Lo Bello M. Battistoni A. Mazzetti A.P. Board P.G. Muramatsu M. Federici G. Ricci G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1249-1253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Several pieces of evidence indicate that the irregular α helix 2 is a flexible region even in the wild-type enzyme; it displays the highest temperature factors among all other regions of domain I (5Lo Bello M.

Finally, the strongest evidence for large motions of helix 2 is the disulfide bond formation between Cys-101 and Cys-47, which are 18 Å apart in the reduced enzyme complexed with S-hexylglutathione (6Ricci G.

Is the catalytic efficiency of GST P1-1 related, in some way, to flexibility and fluctuations of some portions of the enzyme and, in particular, of the α helix 2? This paper and the following one (7Caccuri A.M. Ascenzi P. Antonini G. Parker M.W. Oakley A.J. Chiessi E. Nuccetelli M. Battistoni A. Bellizia A. Ricci G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16193-16198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) explore this hypothesis. It is well known that polymers such as proteins undergo significant fluctuations at room temperature. The x-ray structure of an enzyme represents the average of atomic positions, but atoms and portions of the molecule often exhibit motions of sizable amplitudes about these averages. Obviously, this phenomenon is more emphatic in solution than in the crystal. In a number of enzymes, not only local side chain or loop motions have been observed but also larger scale motions involving helix, domain, and subunit (8Brooks C.L. Karplus M. Pettitt B.M. Prigogine I. Rice S.A. Proteins: A Theoretical Perspective of Dynamics, Structure, and Thermodynamics. John Wiley & Sons, New York1988: 1Google Scholar). The presence of such fluctuations implies that a protein displays a range of transient conformations, sometimes quite different from the average structure. For a number of enzymes, it has been also demonstrated that these motions play a significant role in the catalytic mechanism (8Brooks C.L. Karplus M. Pettitt B.M. Prigogine I. Rice S.A. Proteins: A Theoretical Perspective of Dynamics, Structure, and Thermodynamics. John Wiley & Sons, New York1988: 1Google Scholar). In the case of GST, dynamics of this enzyme and its relation to the catalytic mechanism have never been investigated. At present, the static picture of the four isoenzymes (Alpha, Mu, Pi, and Theta) supplied by x-ray data does not allows such correlation. Data in this paper, obtained at pH 6.5 by using 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) as co-substrate, point out a connection between diffusion-controlled motions of protein regions, in particular of helix 2, and the catalytic parameters of GST P1-1. Evidence is also given that, in solution, the structure of this enzyme in complex with GSH is different from that of the apoenzyme. Human placenta GST P1-1 wild-type, C47S mutant, and C47S/C101S double mutant were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (4Lo Bello M. Battistoni A. Mazzetti A.P.

GSH, CDNB, and 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (FDNB) were purchased from Sigma. CDNB was dissolved in ethanol. S-(2,4-Dinitrophenyl) glutathione (GS-DNP) was synthesized as previously reported (5Lo Bello M. Pastore A. Petruzzelli R. Parker M.W. Wilce M.C.J. Federici G. Ricci G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 804-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Steady-state kinetics of GST P1-1 with CDNB as co-substrate was measured at 340 nm where the GS-DNP product absorbs (ε340 nm = 9.6 mM−1 cm−1) (9Habig W.H. Jakoby W.B. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 77: 398-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (2029) Google Scholar). Measurements were performed with a double-beam UVICON 940 spectrophotometer (Kontron Instruments) equipped with a cuvette holder fixed at 25°C. Kinetic experiments were done in 1 ml (final volume) of 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, containing 0.1-0.3 µg of GST and variable amounts of substrates. The reaction rates were measured at 0.1-s intervals for a total period of 12 s. Initial rates were determined by linear regression and corrected for the spontaneous reaction. kcat and KCDNBm values for wild type, and Cys-47 mutants were calculated at fixed GSH concentration (10 mM) and variable CDNB concentrations (from 50 µM to 1 mM). KGSHm value for wild type was obtained at fixed CDNB concentration (1 mM) and variable GSH concentrations (from 50 µM to 10 mM). Steady-state kinetic mechanism at pH 6.5 was studied by varying CDNB and GSH from 50 µM to 1 mM over a matrix of 36 substrate concentrations. Stopped-flow measurements were performed on a stopped-flow spectrophotometer consisting of a High-Tech SHU-51 rapid mixing device thermostatted at 25°C equipped with a Jasco J600 spectropolarimeter. Light path of the cell was 0.2 cm. Dead-time of the instrument was <5 ms. Presteady-state analysis was performed by rapid mixing of GST P1-1 (150 µM active sites) in 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, containing 1 mM GSH with an identical volume of 2 mM CDNB in the same buffer. Blank was done in the same conditions without GST. The increase of absorbance at 340 nm was monitored every 0.5 ms. The cooperativity of Cys-47 mutants of GST P1-1 toward GSH was assayed by following the dependence of the enzymatic rate upon GSH concentration (from 10 µM to 10 mM) at constant CDNB concentration (1 mM) in 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5 (25°C). Kinetic data were analyzed by the KaleidaGraph (version 2.0.2.) (Abelbeck Software) computer program and fitted to a rate equation expressing cooperativity as previously reported (3Ricci G.

The best fit fulfills [S]GSH0.5 and Hill coefficient (nH). The effect of viscosity on kinetic parameters and cooperativity was assayed at 25°C by using 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffers containing variable glycerol or sucrose concentrations. Viscosity values (η) were calculated as described (22Wolf A.V. Brown M.G. Prentiss P.G. Weast R.C. Astle M.J. Beyer W.H. Handbook of Chemistry and Physics.

Viscosities are reported relative to that of 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5 (η°). CD spectra of GST P1-1 at pH 6.5 in the presence (η/η°= 3.8) or absence of glycerol were obtained by means of a Jasco J600 spectropolarimeter. The reactivity of Cys-47 toward 2,2′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) was assayed at 25°C by following the increase of absorbance at 412 nm where the thionitrobenzoate ion absorbs (ε412 nm = 13.6 mM−1 cm−1) (10Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (20884) Google Scholar). A typical incubation mixture contained 4.4 µM (active site) GST P1-1 and 0.2 mM DTNB in 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0. At this pH value only Cys-47 and Cys-101 react with DTNB, but Cys-47 is about 10-fold more reactive than Cys-101 (6Ricci G. Del Boccio G. Pennelli A. Lo Bello M. Petruzzelli R. Caccuri A.M. Barra D. Federici G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21409-21415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); thus, the second-order kinetic constants (kGSTDTNB), calculated from the initial slopes at 412 nm at variable DTNB concentrations (from 0.1 to 0.5 mM), must be referred to Cys-47, exclusively. Similar experiments were performed on C47S and C101S to calculate kGSTDTNB for Cys-101 and Cys-47, respectively. The second-order kinetic constant for the reaction between free cysteine and DTNB (kCysDTNB) was obtained in 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, at fixed cysteine concentration (10 µM) and variable DTNB (from 0.1 to 0.5 mM). Pseudo first-order kinetic constant for the oxidation involving Cys-47 and Cys-101 (kGSTox) was obtained by following the inactivation of GST P1-1 (10 µM) incubated at 25°C in 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, in the presence of 2 µM CuSO4. In similar conditions, the pseudo first-order kinetic constant (kCysox) for the oxidation of free cysteine (10 µM) was also calculated. The viscosity effect on the dissociation constant of GSH binding (KGSHD) was evaluated by fluorometry. At different glycerol concentrations, binding of GSH (varied from 10 µM to 1 mM in 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5) was measured by intrinsic fluorescence quenching, as described previously (3Ricci G. Lo Bello M. Caccuri A.M. Pastore A. Nuccetelli M. Parker M.W. Federici G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1243-1248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Fluorescence measurements were done with a Perkin-Elmer LS-5 fluorometer with a sample holder at 25°C. Excitation was at 280 nm and the emission was at 340 nm. GST labeled with 2-(4′-maleimidylanilino)naphthalene-6-sulfonic acid (MIANS) was prepared by reacting 10 µM C47S mutant with 100 µM MIANS in 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5. After 30 min at 25°C, the excess of reagent was removed by a G-25 Sephadex column equilibrated with the same buffer. In a typical experiment, different amounts of GSH (from 10 to 100 mM) were added to 0.34 µM C47S-MIANS protein. Emission spectra were recorded after each addition on a single-photon-counting spectrofluorometer (Fluoromax, S.A. Instruments, Paris, France). The bandwidth of excitation and emission monochromators was D = 4 nm. All measurements were carried out at 25°C. The efficiency of energy transfer, E0, between donors (Trp-28 and Trp-38) and acceptor (MIANS) was evaluated from the relative quantum yield of the donors (11Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1983: 303Crossref Google Scholar) according to Equation 1 E0=1−FDA0/FD0(Eq.1) where F0D and F0DA are the donors' quantum yields in absence or in presence of the acceptor. A similar equation was used to evaluate the transfer efficiency in presence of GSH, E#: E#=1−FDA#/FD#.(Eq.2) The above equations may be written in terms of the distances between the donors and the acceptor in the two cases, (R0 and R#, respectively) as E0=α0FD0α0FD0+(R0)6(Eq.3) and E#=α#FD#α#FD#+(R#)6(Eq.4) where the α0 and α# factors depend on chemico-physical parameters (i.e. the overlapping integral, the refraction index, and the relative donors-acceptor dipole orientation). Assuming that GSH molecule has a small effect on these factors, α0≅α# so that the ratio between the Equations 3 and 4 yields the following relationship: R#R0FD#FD01−E#E#E01−E06=K(Eq.5) From the last equation it is possible to evaluate in which percentage K, the mean distance between donors and acceptors, is affected when the substrate GSH is added in solution. Nucleophilic aromatic substitution reactions proceed in solution via formation of a σ-complex intermediate. Variation of the leaving group is a diagnostic procedure to define the rate-limiting step. In the uncatalyzed reaction between GSH and CDNB the second-order kinetic constant (ksp) increases about 48-fold by substituting the more electronegative F for Cl in the aromatic reagent (Table I). In this case the rate-determining event is the formation of the σ-complex intermediate. The same reaction catalyzed by GST P1-1 is quite insensitive to the nature of the leaving group, giving a kFDNBcat/kCDNBcat ratio of 1.4. Thus, the rate-limiting step of the enzyme-catalyzed reaction seems not to be related to a chemical event, i.e. the formation of the σ-complex or its decomposition. In the latter case a kFDNBcat/kCDNBcat ratio <1 is expected due to the stronger C-F bond. Previously, a physical rate-determining step has been claimed to occur in the reaction between GSH and 4-chloro-3-nitro-1-(trifluoromethyl) benzene catalyzed by the 3–3 isoenzyme from rat liver (Mu class) (12Johnson W.W. Liu S. Ji X. Gilliland G.L. Armstrong R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11508-11511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In that case the product dissociation has been suggested to be rate-limiting.Table IEffect of leaving groupGST P1-1 catalyzed reactionSpontaneous reactionkFDNBcat (s−1)106kCDNBcat (s−1)76kFDNBcat/kCDNBcat1.4kFDNBsp (µM−1 min−1)25kCDNBsp (µM−1 min−1)0.52kFDNBsp/kCDNBsp48 Open table in a new tab During an enzymatic reaction, the existence of a rate-limiting step occurring after the product formation must be signaled by a burst phase before the attainment of the steady state. This does not occur with GST P1-1, as shown in Fig. 1. This finding and the scarce effect of the leaving group suggest that the rate-limiting step occurs before the σ-complex formation. Moreover, the steady-state kinetics analysis performed at pH 6.5 (data not shown) confirms that the reaction proceeds by a rapid equilibrium random sequential bi-bi mechanism as already described by Ivanetich and Goold (13Ivanetich K.M. Goold R.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 998: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Thus, the rate-limiting step must be localized between the ternary complex formation and the chemical event; it should be one or more conformational transitions occurring after the binding of the substrates. The viscosity variation method provides a means for checking the presence of a diffusion-limited component for an enzyme-catalyzed reaction. With very efficient enzymes in which the rate-determining step is the encounter of substrates with the enzyme (kcat/Km = 107-1010M−1 s−1), the second-order rate constant kcat/Km decreases linearly by increasing the microviscosity of the medium as predicted by the Stokes-Einstein relationship (14Kramers H.A. Physica. 1940; 7: 284-304Crossref Scopus (7019) Google Scholar). Plots of the inverse relative specificity constant k°cat/K°m/kcat/Km against the relative viscosity (η/η°) have slopes ranging from unity to a fractional number depending on whether the reaction is a strictly or partially diffusion-controlled process. Similar viscosity dependence must be observed for enzyme in which the rate-limiting step is a diffusion-controlled product release but, in this case, the unimolecular constant kcat is affected (12Johnson W.W. Liu S. Ji X. Gilliland G.L. Armstrong R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11508-11511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A different behavior on viscosity has been found for rate-determining events involving diffusion-controlled motions of enzyme portions. As this is an intramolecular event, plots of k°cat/kcat against η/η° usually display slopes <1 because the solvent viscosity effect is damped by an internal friction of protein regions (15Sampson N.S. Knowles J.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8488-8492Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Clearly, the effect of viscosogen on kcat may vary depending on its accessibility and then on its molecular hindrance. The viscosity effect on GST P1-1 with CDNB as co-substrate may be related to that latter case. Although GST P1-1 is far from a “perfect” enzyme (kcat/Km≅ 5·105M−1 s−1), its kinetic parameters are remarkably affected by viscosity (Fig. 2 and Table II). In the presence of glycerol as co-solvent, k°cat/kcat increases linearly with η/η° giving a slope of about 0.8, while the uncatalyzed reaction is fully viscosity-independent. KGSHm is also affected by glycerol; a linear plot of Km°/Km against η/η° was obtained with a slope of 0.61. On the contrary, no change has been observed for KCDNBm. The lowering of KGSHm by viscosity really reflects a thermodynamic increased affinity; the decrease of KGSHD on viscosity measured by fluorescence quenching experiments, parallels approximately that of KGSHm (Table II). A larger viscosogen such as sucrose also lowers both kcat and KGSHm values, but less efficiently (Table II and Fig. 2).Table II.Viscosity effect on kinetic parameters and on Cys-47 reactivityCo-solventGlycerol, αaα are the slopes of the dependence of kinetic parameters on η/η° as derived from the best linear fit of the experimental data. kCDNBsp, second-order kinetic constant for the spontaneous reaction of GSH with CDNB at pH 6.5; KGSHD, dissociation constant for the GSH-GST complex at pH 6.5; kGSTDTNB, second-order kinetic constant for the reaction of Cys-47 with DTNB at pH 5.0; kCysDTNB, second-order kinetic constant for the reaction of cysteine with DTNB at pH 5.0; kGSTox, first-order kinetic constant for the oxidation between Cys-47 and Cys-101 at pH 8.0: kCysox, second-order kinetic constant for the oxidation of cysteine at pH 8.0.Sucrose, αk°cat/kcat0.81 ± 0.040.30 ± 0.02kCDNB°sp/kCDNBsp0.01 ± 0.010.02 ± 0.01KGSH°m/KGSHm0.61 ± 0.050.34 ± 0.08KGSH°D/KGSHD0.90 ± 0.2KCDNB°m/KCDNBm0.03 ± 0.050.01 ± 0.1kGST°DTNB/kGSTDTNB0.95 ± 0.050.54 ± 0.04kCys°DTNB/kCysDTNB0.03 ± 0.010.00 ± 0.01kGST°ox/kGSTox1.23 ± 0.09kCys°ox/kCysox0.02 ± 0.030.01 ± 0.02a α are the slopes of the dependence of kinetic parameters on η/η° as derived from the best linear fit of the experimental data. kCDNBsp, second-order kinetic constant for the spontaneous reaction of GSH with CDNB at pH 6.5; KGSHD, dissociation constant for the GSH-GST complex at pH 6.5; kGSTDTNB, second-order kinetic constant for the reaction of Cys-47 with DTNB at pH 5.0; kCysDTNB, second-order kinetic constant for the reaction of cysteine with DTNB at pH 5.0; kGSTox, first-order kinetic constant for the oxidation between Cys-47 and Cys-101 at pH 8.0: kCysox, second-order kinetic constant for the oxidation of cysteine at pH 8.0. Open table in a new tab These findings can be interpreted by a static picture in which viscosogens modify “aspecifically” the structure of the enzyme lowering both kcat and KGSHm values. This possibility is not supported by CD spectra of GST P1-1 which, in the absence and in the presence of glycerol (η/η° = 3.8), are indistinguishable either in the 210–240 or in the 250–300 nm regions (spectra not shown). More likely, we can assume a dynamic scenario in which kcat and KGSHm are modulated by diffusion-controlled motions of one or more parts of the protein. Because of its high flexibility, helix 2 is a good candidate for such a phenomenon. Cys-47 is the most reactive among the four cysteinyl residues present in each subunit. At pH 5.0, DTNB reacts exclusively with Cys-47 and Cys-101, but the reaction with Cys-47 is about 10-fold faster (6Ricci G. Del Boccio G. Pennelli A. Lo Bello M. Petruzzelli R. Caccuri A.M. Barra D. Federici G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21409-21415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cys-47 is located at the end of helix 2 with its sulfhydryl function probably linked in an ion pair with Lys-54 and placed in a hydrophobic pocket formed by the main chain atoms of Lys-44 and Gln-51 and side chain atoms of Trp-38 and Leu-52 (2Lo Bello M. Parker M.W. Desideri A. Polticelli F. Falconi M. Del Boccio G. Pennelli A. Federici G. Ricci G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19033-19038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the apoenzyme the accessibility of this residue may be related to the flexibility and frequency of spatial fluctuations of helix 2. Thus, we used Cys-47 as an intrinsic probe to assay the influence of viscosogens on diffusion-controlled motions of this protein region. As shown in Table II and Fig. 3, the reactivity of Cys-47 with DTNB is modulated by viscosity. By using glycerol as co-solvent, the dependence of kGSTDTNB°/kGSTDTNB against η/η° is strictly linear with a slope of about 0.9. Sucrose is again less effective giving a slope of 0.5. On the contrary, both viscosogens have no effect on the reaction between free cysteine and DTNB. The viscosity dependence of Cys-47 reactivity parallels that obtained for kcat and KGSHm and points out a possible correlation between diffusion-controlled fluctuations of helix 2, kcat, and KGSHm. A more evident effect by viscosity was observed in the oxidative process in which Cys-47 must fluctuate greatly so as to approach Cys-101 (located on helix 4), which is 18 Å away in the reduced enzyme (1Reinemer P. Dirr H.W. Ladenstein R. Huber R. Lo Bello M. Federici G. Parker M.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 214-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 6Ricci G. Del Boccio G. Pennelli A. Lo Bello M. Petruzzelli R. Caccuri A.M. Barra D. Federici G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21409-21415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pseudo first-order kinetic constant of this reaction (kGSTox) is again linearly lowered by increasing viscosity while the oxidation process of free cysteine is viscosity-independent. A linear plot of kGSTox°/kGSTox against η/η° was obtained with a slope of 1.23 (Table II). This high value probably reflects a cumulative effect of viscosity on two different diffusion-dependent fluctuations possibly involving helix 2 and helix 4. In this context, it may be informative to observe the effect of an increased viscosity on the reactivity of Cys-47 and Cys-101 in the C101S and C47S mutants, respectively. Both Cys-47 and Cys-101 reactivities toward DTNB are remarkably affected by viscosity (Table III), thus suggesting also that helix 4 is involved in diffusion-controlled motions.Table III.Viscosity effect on kinetic parameters and on the reactivity of Cys-47 and Cys-101 in some GST mutantsMutantC47S, αaα are the slopes of the dependence of kinetic parameters on η/η° (glycerol as co-solvent) as derived from the best linear fit of the experimental data.

A possible explanation of this induced communication between subunits is an increased flexibility of helix 2 caused by the absence of Cys-47 so helix 2 becomes in contact with helix 4 of the adjacent subunit (4Lo Bello M.

Also this peculiar phenomenon seems to be dependent on diffusional-controlled motions of helix 2, as increased viscosity by glycerol strongly lowers the cooperativity of both C47S and C47S/C101S mutants (Table IV). Similar to that observed for the wild-type enzyme, also [S]GSH°0.5/[S]GSH0.5 and k°cat/kcat ratios for C47S, C101S, and C47S/C101S linearly increase by increasing η/η° (Table III).Table IV.Viscosity effect on the positive cooperativity of Cys-47 mutants by GSHRelative viscosityaExperiments were performed in triplicate at pH 6.5 with and without glycerol as co-solvent as described under “Experimental Procedures.” (η/η°)13.8nHbnH are the Hill coefficients calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Values at η/η° = 1 are drawn from Ref. 3.nHC47S1.431.10C47S/C101S1.561.02a Experiments were performed in triplicate at pH 6.5 with and without glycerol as co-solvent as described under “Experimental Procedures.”b nH are the Hill coefficients calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Values at η/η° = 1 are drawn from 3Ricci G.

Open table in a new tab A crucial question, related to the structural flexibility of GST P1-1, is the possible existence of an induced-fit mechanism by the substrate binding. A recent report showing similar x-ray structures for the apoenzyme and GSH-complexed Alpha class GST, rules out this possibility in that case (16Cameron A.D. Sinning I. L'Eremite G. Olin B. Board P.G. Mannervik B. Jones T.A. Structure. 1995; 3: 717-727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). We obtained a different result for GST P1-1 in solution. Evidence for conformational change upon GSH or GSH analogue binding has been previously deduced from the intrinsic fluorescence quenching and from changes in the near-UV CD spectrum (17Caccuri A.M. Aceto A. Rosato N. Di Ilio C. Piemonte F. Federici G. It. J. Biochem. 1991; 40: 304-311PubMed Google Scholar). A more quantitative evidence for an induced-fit mechanism is now obtained by means of the fluorescent probe (MIANS) linked on Cys-101 (helix 4) which is 18 Å from Trp-38 on the mobile helix 2 and 23 Å from Trp-28. These experiments have been performed on C47S mutant as any chemical modification on Cys-47 yields a complete inactivation (18Desideri A. Caccuri A.M. Polizio F. Bastoni R. Federici G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2063-2066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The C47S-MIANS enzyme has a kcat value of 28 s−1 and KGSHm value of 13 mM. The fluorescence spectrum of C47S-MIANS is shown in Fig. 4. Upon excitation at 280 nm a residual tryptophanyl emission is present around 340 nm and a major emission peaks at about 425 nm indicating a very efficient energy transfer between the tryptophans and MIANS. When variable amounts of GSH are added in solution, a decrease of the fluorescence at 425 nm is observed with a concomitant increase of the emission at 340 nm (Fig. 4). In Table V both the quantum yields and the transfer efficiencies are reported. According to the Förster theory of energy transfer (11Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1983: 303Crossref Google Scholar), a decrease in the transfer efficiency corresponds to an increase in the distance R between the donor and the acceptor. Using the equations reported under “Experimental Procedures” we evaluated a ratio R#/R0 = 1.25 between the Förster mean distance in presence (R#) or in absence (R0) of GSH. It follows that upon GSH binding the distance between MIANS (helix 4) and tryptophans increases 4.5, 3.5, or 4.0 Å depending whether the energy donors are Trp-28, Trp-38, or both, respectively.Table V.Fluorometry dataSample (%)a is the relative intrinsic fluorescence quantum yield.E (%)bE is the transfer efficiency.

The three-dimensional structure of GST P1-1 showing the relative positions of residues referenced in this paper is reported in Fig. 5. On the basis of presteady-state and steady-state kinetic experiments, the rate-determining step of the catalyzed reaction between GSH and CDNB must be localized between the ternary complex formation and the chemical event. For the sake of simplicity we assume this event(s) to be a single conformational transition of the ternary complex. The minimal kinetic pathway is shown in Equation 6: E+S1+S2→←slowS1−E*−S2→E−P⇄E+P(Eq.6) In this context, GST P1-1 behaves differently both from the Muclass 4–4 isoenzyme where the σ-complex formation has been demonstrated to be rate-limiting (19Chen W.-J. Graminski G.F. Armstrong R.N. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 647-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and from the 3–3 isoenzyme in which the dissociation of products is probably the rate-determining step (12Johnson W.W. Liu S. Ji X. Gilliland G.L. Armstrong R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11508-11511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The viscosity variation procedure indicates that kcat and KGSHm are modulated by diffusion-controlled motions of the protein. As the kcat value for GST P1-1 is 76 s−1 (Table I), far from that expected for diffusion controlled kinetics, we must assume that the attainment of the kinetically productive conformation is a rare event among a number of fast diffusion-controlled motions. Sucrose, a larger viscosogen, lowers again KGSHm and kcat values but less efficiently than glycerol. This may be due to a lesser possibility of sucrose to reach the inside protein pockets. The reactivity of Cys-47, which is located at the end of helix 2, has been used to probe possible diffusional-controlled fluctuations of helix 2. The increase of viscosity by glycerol lowers the reactivity of Cys-47 toward DTNB (Table II). A similar effect by viscosity has been observed in the oxidative process involving Cys-47 and Cys-101 residues. Interestingly, this viscosity effect on Cys-47 reactivity parallels that observed on KGSHm and kcat. The fascinating hypothesis that both kcat and KGSHm are modulated by diffusion-controlled motions of helix 2 cannot be unequivocally demonstrated because other parts of the enzyme display diffusion-controlled motions (i.e. helix 4) as suggested by the viscosity-dependence of Cys-101 reactivity in C47S mutant enzyme. In Cys-47 mutants the increased flexibility of helix 2, which triggers the kinetic and binding cooperativity of GSH, is viscosity-dependent and appears diffusion-controlled. At high η/η° values, the positive cooperativity almost disappears for C47S single mutant and C47S/C101S double mutant with a concomitant decrease of [S]GSH0.5 and kcat values (Table III., Table IV.). Thus, the suggested relationship between cooperativity and flexibility of helix 2 (3Ricci G. Lo Bello M. Caccuri A.M. Pastore A. Nuccetelli M. Parker M.W. Federici G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1243-1248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) is further confirmed. Functionally important dynamics of GST P1-1 were also suggested by an increase in the distance between helix 2 and helix 4 (about 4 Å) upon GSH binding as calculated by means of fluorescence experiments with MIANS."

P2U agonists reportedly induce limited enzyme secretion and enhance the respiratory burst in response to chemotactic factors. We demonstrate here that P2U agonists are chemotactic for neutrophils or differentiated HL60 cells. Rhodamine phalloidin staining indicates that ATPγS treatment induces actin polymerization and shape changes similar to those seen when these cells are treated with chemotactic peptide fMet-Leu-Phe. Although undifferentiated HL60 cells fail to mount a rise in Ca2+ when challenged with fMet-Leu-Phe, they increase Ca2+ in response to P2U agonists. However, functional expression of phospholipase C-coupled receptors is not sufficient for chemotaxis since HL60 cell migration in response to these agonists or to fMet-Leu-Phe occurs only after exposure to differentiating agents such as BT2cAMP. In addition to the well known G protein-linked receptors for lipid or peptide chemotactic factors, neutrophils apparently also can utilize G protein-linked purino/pyrimidino receptors to recognize nucleotides as chemoattractants.

https://openalex.org/W2161740628,"Prolactin (PRL) is essential for progesterone biosynthesis and luteal cell hypertrophy of the rat corpus luteum during pregnancy. Both the long and short form of the PRL receptor have been identified in the corpus luteum of pregnant rat. The long form has been shown to transduce PRL signal in other cells, whereas no information is available on the role of the short form, especially in the corpus luteum. In the present study, we have cloned a rat ovarian-specific phosphoprotein, PRAP (RL eceptor ssociated rotein), which has no significant homology to other known proteins. We have demonstrated that this protein is immunoprecipitated by anti-PRL receptor and anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. To determine whether PRAP associates with either the long or the short form of the PRL receptor, fusion proteins with glutathione S-transferase containing the cytoplasmic domain of the long or short form of the PRL receptor were produced, purified, and incubated with luteal proteins. Our results indicate that PRAP preferentially binds to the short form of the PRL receptor. Thus, the long form and short forms of the PRL receptor may signal through distinct pathways. These data provide evidence for the involvement of a novel protein in PRL signal transduction and suggest that PRAP may contribute to the luteotropic effects of PRL on the corpus luteum during pregnancy.

It enhances luteinizing hormone receptor activity in the pregnant rat corpus luteum (1Gibori G. Richards J.S. Endocrinology. 1978; 102: 767-774Google Scholar) by inducing luteinizing hormone receptor mRNA levels (2Segaloff D.L. Wang H. Richards J.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1856-1865Google Scholar). It also sustains elevated levels of estrogen receptors in the corpus luteum (3Gibori G. Richards J.S. Keyes P.L. Biol. Reprod. 1979; 21: 419-424Google Scholar, 4Gibori G. Keyes P.L.

Moreover, PRL sustains the high level of progesterone by inhibiting the expression of 20α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, thereby reducing the transformation of progesterone into inactive 20α-hydroxyprogesterone (7Albarracin C.T.

Although the effects of PRL on the corpus luteum are well documented, the mechanism through which the PRL ligand-receptor interaction is transduced in the ovary remains completely uncharacterized. Unlike the mouse, in which there are multiple forms of the PRL receptors, three short forms and one long form (8Clarke D.L. Young K.H. Linzer D.I.H. Hsueh A.J.W. Schomberg D.W. Ovarian Cell Interactions. Springer -Verlag Inc., New York1994: 110Google Scholar, 9Davis J.A. Linzer D.I.H. Mol.

They share identical extracellular and transmembrane domains but differ in the length and sequence of their cytoplasmic domains (10Boutin J.-M. Jolicoeur C. Okamura H. Gagnon J. Edery M. Shirota M.

In addition, an intermediate form of the PRL receptor specific to Nb2 cells has been cloned and shown to be a mutant of the long form of the rat PRL receptor (13Ali S. Pellegrini I. Kelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20110-20117Google Scholar). Recently, both the long form and short form of the PRL receptor were found to be expressed in the whole rat ovary (11Shirota M. Banville D. Ali S.

It is unknown whether either or both of these receptor forms can transduce PRL signal in the corpus luteum. Lacking enzymatic activity, the PRL receptor ultimately relies on interactions with receptor-associated cellular proteins for the generation of second messengers (17Lebrun J.J. Ali S. Sofer L.

Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13246-13253Google Scholar). Extensive studies carried out on Nb2 cells and mammary gland cells have shown that the long form and the intermediate form are fully capable of transducing a signal through an association with protein kinases (23Lesueur L. Edery M. Ali S. Paly J. Kelly P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 824-828Google Scholar, 24Ali S. Edery M. Pellegrini I. Lesueur L. Paly J. Djiane J. Kelly P.A. Mol.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2182-2191Google Scholar). As a result of PRL binding to the long form, a tyrosine kinase (JAK2) is activated, which subsequently phosphorylates a transcription factor (Stat5). Upon activation by phosphorylation, Stat5 binds to the PRL response element of an appropriate target gene, such as the β-casein gene promoter, and induces β-casein gene transcription (26Wakao H. Gouilleux F. Groner B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2182-2191Google Scholar, 27Shuai K. Ziemiecki A. Wilks A. Harpur A.G. Sadowski H.B. Gilman M.Z. Darnell J.E.

Little information is available on the role of the short form of PRL receptor in the PRL signal transduction pathway, although a recent report indicates that one of the three short forms of the PRL receptor in the mouse can induce MAP kinase phosphorylation and cell proliferation in response to ligand binding (30Das R. Vonderhaar B.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1750-1759Google Scholar). To date, no proteins capable of binding to the cytoplasmic domain of the PRL receptor have been identified in the corpus luteum. Such proteins would presumably play an important role in the response of the corpus luteum to PRL during pregnancy. We have previously demonstrated that PRL and estradiol regulate the levels of a 32-kDa luteal phosphoprotein (31McLean M.P. Nelson S. Parmer T. Khan I. Steinschneider A. Puryear T. Gibori G. Endocrinology. 1990; 126: 1796-1805Google Scholar, 32Parmer T.G. McLean M.P. Duan W.R. Nelson S.E. Albarracin C.T. Khan I. Gibori G. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 2213-2221Google Scholar). In the present study, we describe the cloning of this 32-kDa protein and show that this protein interacts with the short form of PRL receptor in the rat corpus luteum. We now name this protein PRAP for RL eceptor ssociated rotein. Glutathione-agarose beads, glutathione, and mouse IgG1 were from Sigma. Protein G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow bead suspension was purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Mouse monoclonal antibody to rat PRL receptor (U6) was kindly provided by Dr. Paul A. Kelly (Nekar Hospital, Paris, France). Mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Products for ECL (enhanced chemiluminescence) were from Amersham. Corpora lutea from day 15 pregnant rats were used as a source of PRAP. Microsomal fractions from the corpora lutea were obtained by differential centrifugation (31McLean M.P. Nelson S. Parmer T. Khan I. Steinschneider A. Puryear T. Gibori G. Endocrinology. 1990; 126: 1796-1805Google Scholar). Protein samples for sequencing were purified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (33LeGendre N. Mansfield M. Weiss A. Matsudaira P. Matsudaira P. A Practical Guide to Protein and Peptide Purification for Microsequencing. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1993: 74Google Scholar). Separated proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidine difluoride membranes and stained with Ponceau S, and the 32-kDa band was excised. Protein sequencing was performed by The Protein Sequencing/Synthesis Laboratory at The University of Illinois at Chicago. An oligo(dT)-primed rat cDNA expression library made from the mRNA of corpora lutea of day 15 pregnant rats was constructed in λZAP II (Stratagene). The peptide sequence MRKVVLIT at the N terminus of PRAP was used to design a degenerate 24-mer oligonucleotide. This oligonucleotide was labeled at the 5′ end with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham) and used as a probe. The cDNA library was screened following standard methods (34Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring HarborNew York1989: 12.1Google Scholar). pBluescript SK(−) containing the insert was excised in vivo by ExAssist/SOLR system (Stratagene). Two of the 38 positive clones were selected for DNA sequencing using the dideoxy chain termination method (35Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Google Scholar) with a Sequenase Version 2.0 DNA-sequencing kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Both strands of cDNA of the two clones were completely sequenced. The amino acid sequence predicted from the isolated cDNA was compared with sequences in PDB (Brookhaven Protein Data Bank), SwissProt (SWISS-PROT, release 31.0), PIR (Protein Identification Resources, release 45.0), and GenPept (CDS translations from GenBank, release 90.0) data bases, using the BLAST and FASTA software at the Research Resources Center of The University of Illinois at Chicago. Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) was done essentially as described by Frohman et al. (36Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Google Scholar). The first strand cDNA was synthesized using 1 µg of dT16-adapter primer supplied with the 3′-RACE System (Life Technologies, Inc./BRL, Life Technologies) and 1 µg of total RNA from the corpus luteum of day 15 pregnant rats as template. Polymerase chain reaction amplification was done using Universal Amplification Primer (UAP) from 3′-RACE System and gene specific primer 1 (GSP1) (AGATCACCACAGCTGACA) and Oligo 3 primer (CTACAAGACCTTACT) derived from the 3′ end sequence common to both clones. The products were analyzed on an agarose gel, and amplifications were repeated by extracting a 5-µl plug of agarose from the original amplification and adding it to 50 µl of a complete amplification reaction containing the gene specific primer 2 proceeded by four repeats of CUA (CUACUACUACUAACGTTCCCCAGAGCA), the sequence downstream of GSP1. After amplification, 3′-RACE products was directly cloned into a vector using CLONEAMP pAMP10 system (Life Technologies, Inc./BRL, Life Technologies) (37Nisson P.E. Rashtchian A. Watkins P.C. PCR Meth. Appl. 1991; 1: 120-123Google Scholar) and transformed into DH5α competent cells. The cDNA was sequenced from both strands as described above. Corpora lutea were obtained from day 13–15 intact pregnant rats and dissected from adhering ovarian follicles and interstitial tissues. Corpora lutea were kept in serum-free media and divided into four groups for treatment with PRL (NIDDK oPRL-18, 1 µg/ml) for 0, 20, 40, or 60 min. Corpora lutea were then homogenized in the homogenizing buffer (31McLean M.P. Nelson S. Parmer T. Khan I. Steinschneider A. Puryear T. Gibori G. Endocrinology. 1990; 126: 1796-1805Google Scholar) with or without 250 mM Na3VO4. The cDNAs encoding the cytoplasmic domains of the long and short forms of the PRL receptor were inserted into the pGEX3X vector (8Clarke D.L. Young K.H. Linzer D.I.H. Hsueh A.J.W. Schomberg D.W. Ovarian Cell Interactions. Springer -Verlag Inc., New York1994: 110Google Scholar, 38Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Google Scholar) in-frame with the upstream sequences encoding glutathione S-transferase (GST). Expression of PRL-R fusion proteins was induced in Escherichia coli strain DH5α cells transformed with these constructs by addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside. To purify the fusion proteins, cells were harvested by centrifugation and suspended in 12.5 ml of 25% sucrose, 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0. Cells were lysed by treatment with 1 mg/ml lysozyme for 5 min, followed by addition of β-mercaptoethanol to 20 mM, EDTA to 250 mM, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to 5 mM and agitation for 15 min at 4°C. Samples were adjusted to 100 mM KCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, incubated for an additional 15 min at 4°C, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C. The supernatant was collected and the fusion proteins were recovered by binding to glutathione-agarose beads. The agarose beads were collected by centrifugation (1,000 × g) after a 60-min incubation at room temperature or overnight binding at 4°C, and washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline. The GST-PRL receptor-agarose beads were resuspended in an equal volume of phosphate-buffered saline. Fusion proteins were eluted with 50 mM free glutathione in 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, and analyzed on SDS-PAGE (38Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Google Scholar). Luteal protein extracts were incubated with glutathione-agarose beads for 60 min at room temperature to remove proteins that bound nonspecifically. Samples were centrifuged at 1,000 × g, and the supernatant was recovered and adjusted to 1% CHAPS. Fusion proteins containing the long (PRL-RL) or short (PRL-RS) form of the PRL receptor were isolated on glutathione-agarose beads, and the beads were then incubated overnight at 4°C with 200 µg of luteal proteins. Following incubation, the beads were collected by centrifugation and washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. GST or PRL-R fusion proteins and their attached proteins were then eluted with either SDS-PAGE sample buffer or 500 µl of 50 mM glutathione with continuous mixing for 20 min at room temperature. Eluted proteins were precipitated in 10% trichloroacetic acid and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and stained. Immunoblotting was performed with PRAP antiserum at a 1:1000 dilution. Immunoreactive proteins were detected using the ECL system. Luteal homogenates were solubilized in 1% Nonidet P-40 and 0.25% deoxycholate. 300 µg of solubilized luteal proteins were incubated overnight at 4°C with shaking with PRL receptor monoclonal antibody or with nonspecific mouse monoclonal antibody of subtype IgG1 at a concentration of 10 µg/ml. Polyclonal PRL receptor antiserum (9Davis J.A. Linzer D.I.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 674-680Google Scholar) and an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody were also used for immunoprecipitation. In these experiments, 300 µg of luteal proteins from corpora lutea treated with PRL were incubated overnight at 4°C with polyclonal PRL receptor antiserum at a 1:500 dilution or with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (10 µg/ml). 20 µl of protein G-Sepharose beads were added into the immune complexes and incubated at 4°C or room temperature for 30 min. The beads were collected by centrifugation and washed extensively. Beads were then suspended in 15 µl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and immunoblotted with PRAP antiserum and polyclonal PRL receptor antiserum (1:500). To explore the possibility that the PRL-inducible 32-kDa luteal phosphoprotein may be involved in the PRL signal transduction pathway, we first examined if this protein associates with the PRL receptor in the corpus luteum. Luteal cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with the U6 monoclonal antibody against the rat PRL receptor and then immunoblotted with the PRAP antiserum. As seen in Fig. 1, the 32-kDa protein was efficiently precipitated by the U6 antibody, but not by a control IgG. Since this result demonstrates that the 32-kDa protein is associated with the PRL receptor in luteal cell extracts, we now refer to this protein as PRL receptor associated protein, or PRAP. Parallel incubations of the luteal cell extracts with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody also resulted in the immunoprecipitation of PRAP (Fig. 1), consistent with PRAP being a substrate for PRL receptor-associated protein tyrosine kinases. To determine if the association of PRAP with the PRL receptor is dependent upon PRL binding, corpora lutea obtained from day 13 pregnant rats were treated with PRL for 0, 20, 40, and 60 min. A polyclonal PRL receptor antiserum was utilized for this immunoprecipitation and was also able to co-precipitate PRAP (Fig. 2A) and the PRL receptor (Fig. 2B). Even though both PRL receptor forms were probably recovered by this procedure, only the long form was detected, presumably because of the greater abundance of that form in the ovary (11Shirota M. Banville D. Ali S. Jolicoeur C. Boutin J.-M. Edery M. Djiane J. Kelly P.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1136-1143Google Scholar, 14Clarke D.L. Arey B.J. Linzer D.I.H.

The amount of PRAP associated with the receptor did not change in response to PRL treatment (Fig. 2A), indicating that PRAP is able to bind to the receptor in the basal state. Extracts from PRL-treated corpora lutea were also subjected to immunoprecipitation with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody to determine if PRAP tyrosine phosphorylation is PRL-dependent. As shown in Fig. 3, PRL treatment did not affect the tyrosine phosphorylation status of this protein.Fig. 3Effect of PRL on PRAP tyrosine phosphorylation. Luteal tissues from day 13 pregnant rats were cultured in serum-free medium and treated with PRL for 0, 20, 40, and 60 min. Luteal extracts were prepared, precipitated with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, and immunoblotted with PRAP antiserum.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Since the corpus luteum contains both short and long PRL receptors, we next sought to determine which form of the receptor is capable of associating with PRAP. Prolactin receptor cytoplasmic domains were expressed in bacteria as GST fusion proteins. Luteal cell extracts from day 15 pregnant rats were applied to glutathione-Sepharose columns to which GST alone or GST linked to the cytoplasmic domain of either the long or short form of the PRL receptor was bound. Proteins retained on the column were recovered by addition of glutathione and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with the PRAP antiserum. Strikingly, PRAP was detected in association with the short form of the PRL receptor, but not with the long form of the PRL receptor nor GST (Fig. 4A). This experiment was repeated with fusion constructs containing either the whole cytoplasm domain of the long receptor form or just the unique cytoplasmic domain of the long receptor; PRAP failed to bind to either of these fusion proteins, but again was able to bind to the short receptor cytoplasmic domain (Fig. 4C). In the condition when GST and GST-PRLR were eluted with glutathione in the absence of luteal proteins, no signal was detected in any of the lanes except the last lane containing luteal proteins rich in PRAP (Fig. 4B). The specific association of PRAP with the short PRL receptor is in marked contrast to the reported association of other factors with the long form of the receptor (18Rui H. Kirken R.A. Farrar W.L. J.

A more complete characterization of PRAP might therefore provide some insight into the role of the short receptor form in PRL action in the ovary. Purified PRAP was subjected to N-terminal protein sequencing, and a sequence for the first 18 amino acids was obtained (MRKVVLITGASSGIGLAL). A degenerate oligonucleotide based on the first eight amino acids was used to screen a rat corpus luteum cDNA library. Thirty-eight positive clones were isolated, and clones 13A5 and 14A1 were completely sequenced from both strands. The 1161-base pair sequence of clone 13A5 (Fig. 5) is identical to the 14A1 sequence except for an extra 94 base pairs at the 5′ of clone 14A1 and differences in the 3′-untranslated region. Both clones contain a single identical open reading frame beginning with the 18 codons predicted from the N-terminal amino acid sequencing (Fig. 5, double underline), confirming that the isolated cDNA clone encodes PRAP. Two adjacent ATG triplets are found at the beginning of the open reading frame, but only one methionine was detected at the N terminus of the protein. Inspection of the two ATG codons reveals that the first ATG has a pyrimidine (T) at position −3, whereas the second ATG has a purine (A) at −3; thus, the second ATG is in a stronger context to act as a translation initiating codon (41Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Google Scholar). Furthermore, an in-frame stop codon (TGA) is present immediately 5′ to the first ATG, thereby precluding the use of another, upstream methionine codon to initiate translation. A termination codon (TGA) is present at position 1017-1019, and thus the open reading frame encodes a protein of 334 amino acids with a calculated Mr of 37,372, slightly larger than the size of the protein detected by gel electrophoresis. Based on the absence of a polyadenylation signal, the initial cDNA clones apparently lacked a complete 3′-untranslated region. To obtain a cDNA clone from this region of the PRAP mRNA, 3′-RACE was used with a (dT)16-adapter primer for reverse transcription of total luteal mRNA from day 15 pregnant rats, and oligonucleotides from the 13A5 and 14A1 3′-untranslated region and the antisense universal adapter primer as polymerase chain reaction primers. A second gene-specific primer was used for reamplification of the 3′-RACE products, which were then cloned and sequenced (Fig. 5, with the gene-specific primer underlined). The sequences at the 5′-end of the clone obtained by 3′-RACE match the sequences at the 3′-end of clone 13A5, but not clone 14A1. This analysis extended the 3′-end of the 13A5 cDNA clone by 537 base pairs, a region that contains a putative polyadenylation signal AATTAAA (shown underlined in Fig. 5) and a residual poly(A) tail. Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequence to the contents of protein data bases failed to identify any significant similarities to known proteins. However, sequence analysis revealed the presence of three potential N-glycosylation sites (positions 37, 178, and 229), two protein kinase C phosphorylation sites (170 and 195), and several casein kinase II phosphorylation sites (118, 125, 180, and 315) (Fig. 5). A PROSITE data base search did not indicate a tyrosine phosphorylation site. However, when compared to the sequence of tyrosine phosphorylation site of Stat1 and Stat5 (26Wakao H. Gouilleux F. Groner B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2182-2191Google Scholar), it appears that this protein contains a putative tyrosine phosphorylation site at position 296 which is presumably a target of JAK2. A hydropathy plot (42Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Google Scholar) identified a hydrophobic region at the N terminus (Fig. 5, Fig. 6), suggesting the presence of a secretion signal peptide which is usually proteolytically removed during protein maturation. However, since the N-terminal peptide sequence predicted from the cDNA clone matches that of the purified protein, this region is not cleaved off. Another hydrophobic region spanning 21 amino acids is located between residues 230 and 250 (Fig. 6); this region may function as a transmembrane domain. If the N-terminal hydrophobic domain is used to initiate translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and the second domain acts as a stop-anchor, then mature PRAP at the cell surface would have the unusual structure of a membrane protein with an extracellular loop rather than an extracellular domain with a free end. The corpus luteum is an important target tissue of PRL (43MacDonald G.J. Yoshinaga K. Greep R.O. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1971; 136: 687-688Google Scholar, 44Gibori G. Khan I. Warshaw M.L.

PRL and PRL-like hormones of placental origin are essential for the survival of this endocrine gland and for its ability to produce progesterone during pregnancy (44Gibori G. Khan I. Warshaw M.L.

Raven Press Ltd., New York1993: 261Google Scholar). Luteal cells are terminally differentiated and do not undergo cell division when stimulated by PRL, in contrast to the mitogenic effect of PRL on Nb2 lymphoma cells. PRL receptors, therefore, may mediate distinct signaling events in Nb2 cells, a standard model for PRL signal transduction, and the corpus luteum. Throughout pregnancy, both forms of the PRL receptor are present in the corpus luteum, with the long form more abundant than the short form (14Clarke D.L. Arey B.J. Linzer D.I.H. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 2594-2603Google Scholar).2 The long form of the PRL receptor is able to signal through JAK2 and Stat5 (17Lebrun J.J. Ali S. Sofer L. Ullrich A. Kelly P.A. J. Biol.

Reprod. 1995; 52: A353Google Scholar, 47Zhong L. Mao J. Robertson M.C. Gibori G. Biol. Reprod. 1995; 52: A379Google Scholar). Preliminary data from our laboratory indicate that treatment of luteinized granulosa cells with PRL causes increased phosphorylation of both JAK2 and Stat5 (47Zhong L. Mao J. Robertson M.C. Gibori G. Biol. Reprod. 1995; 52: A379Google Scholar). In addition, PRL induced the level of Stat5 mRNA and Stat5 binding to the cis-acting DNA elements of the α2-macroglobulin gene (46Dajee M. Raught B. Fey G. Richards J.S. Biol. Reprod. 1995; 52: A353Google Scholar), a gene known to be up-regulated by PRL in the rat ovary (48Gaddy-Kurten D. Hickey G.J. Fey G.H. Gauldie J. Richard J.S. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 2985-2995Google Scholar, 49Gaddy-Kurten D. Richard J.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1280-1291Google Scholar). These data are consistent with a PRL signal being transduced through the JAK2-Stat5 system in the rat ovary, presumably via the long receptor form. However, inhibition of JAK2 activity with tyrosine kinase inhibitors did not affect the regulation of the 20α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase gene by PRL, implying the involvement of other kinase systems or the presence of another PRL signaling pathway in the rat corpus luteum (47Zhong L. Mao J. Robertson M.C. Gibori G. Biol. Reprod. 1995; 52: A379Google Scholar). Indeed, a serine/threonine kinase, Raf-1, has been reported to be complexed with the PRL receptor and activated by PRL (21Clevenger C.V. Torigoe T. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5559-5565Google Scholar), perhaps via recruitment of SHC and Ras to the receptor complex (40Erwin R.A. Kirken R.A. Malabarba M.G. Farrar W.L. Rui H. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3512-3518Google Scholar). Although results from several studies have revealed that the short form is unlikely to be involved in milk gene transcription and cell proliferation, the short form was found to be expressed in many tissues, as ubiquitously as the long form (15Nagano M. Kelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13337-13345Google Scholar). Thus, the short form may also play a particular role in signaling. The short form of the PRL receptor may regulate PRL responsiveness in target tissues by forming inactive heteromeric receptor complexes (25O'Neal K.D. Yu-Lee L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26076-26082Google Scholar). Recent data, although, demonstrate that the short receptor can also signal and stimulate cell proliferation (30Das R. Vonderhaar B.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1750-1759Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate the preferential association of PRAP to the cytoplasmic domain of the short form of the PRL receptor in luteal cells and further suggest that the short form may also be important in the luteotropic action of PRL. It is interesting to note that a 32-kDa protein, with a pI similar to that of PRAP, is expressed in HC11 cells and also associates with the short form of the PRL receptor (8Clarke D.L. Young K.H. Linzer D.I.H. Hsueh A.J.W. Schomberg D.W. Ovarian Cell Interactions. Springer -Verlag Inc., New York1994: 110Google Scholar), although this protein has not yet been identified. PRAP antiserum does recognize a 32-kDa protein in this mammary gland epithelial cell line (data not shown). PRL treatment had no effect on the receptor association or the tyrosine phosphorylation of PRAP. Thus, phosphorylated PRAP appears to be associated with PRL receptor in the basal state. PRAP is tyrosine phosphorylated, and a putative tyrosine phosphorylation site at position 296 (GTNYVKGQ) is similar to the JAK2 phosphorylation sites on Stat1 (GTGYIKTE) and Stat5 (VDGYVKPQ) (26Wakao H. Gouilleux F. Groner B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2182-2191Google Scholar). Thus, one possible role for PRAP may be to occupy JAK2 and prevent it from acting on other targets in the absence of PRL. However, PRAP protein might also be a substrate of other tyrosine kinases, such as c-src, which has recently been reported to associate with the PRL receptor in the rat liver (39Berlanga J.J. Vara J.A.F. Martin-Perez J. Garcia-Ruiz J.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1461-1467Google Scholar), a tissue in which the short form of the receptor is present at high levels (15Nagano M. Kelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13337-13345Google Scholar). The predicted amino acid sequence of the PRAP protein includes an N-terminal as well as an internal hydrophobic region that may function as a signal sequence and a transmembrane domain, respectively. In this model, the N-terminal 229 amino acids would serve as an extracellular domain containing all N-linked glycosylation sites, and the C-terminal 84 amino acids would represent an intracellular domain containing the potential tyrosine phosphorylation site. However, sequence analysis of the purified PRAP protein demonstrated that the N-terminal sequence is not cleaved off. Therefore, if PRAP is translocated to the cell surface, it may have the unusual structure of a transmembrane protein in which the extracellular domain is attached at both ends to the cell membrane to form an extracellular loop. If PRAP is a transmembrane protein, its association with the PRL receptor may be similar to the interaction of gp130 with other cytokine receptors (16Davis S. Aldrich T.H. Stahl N. Pan L. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Ip N.Y. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1993; 260: 1805-1808Google Scholar, 50Hibi M. Murakami M. Saito M. Hirano T. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Cell. 1990; 63: 1149-1157Google Scholar). In summary, we have succeeded in cloning and characterizing a novel 32-kDa luteal protein which is the first identified protein shown to associate with the short form of the PRL receptor. It will be interesting to determine whether PRAP participates in PRL signal transduction and whether PRL inhibition of elongation factor 2 phosphorylation and/or inhibition of 20α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase gene expression involve the short form of the PRL receptor-PRAP complex.

Unfolding by chemical denaturants was irreversible and accompanied by self-association of the protein to form vitronectin multimers. Self-association was evaluated by equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation which demonstrated that multimers form only during the refolding process after removal of denaturant, that multimeric vitronectin dissociates to constituent subunits readily upon treatment with chemical denaturant, and that intermolecular disulfide cross-linking occurs primarily at the dimer level among a subset of constituent vitronectin subunits within the multimer.

Blut. 1989; 59: 419-431Google Scholar, 2Preissner K.T. Jenne D. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1991; 66: 123-132Google Scholar, 3Preissner K.T. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 275-310Google Scholar, 4Tomasini B.R. Mosher D.F. Prog. Hemostasis Thromb. 1991; 10: 269-305Google Scholar, 5Preissner K.T. Jenne D. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1991; 66: 189-194Google Scholar). The broad range in activities of vitronectin stems from its interaction with a wide variety of macromolecules, including zymogens, serpins, serpin-protease complexes, components of the membrane attack complex of complement, and mucopolysaccharides. Quantification and detailed characterization of macromolecular ligand binding activities of vitronectin has been complicated by the fact that different molecular species of vitronectin are recovered from different purification protocols. The protein was first isolated by traditional biochemical approaches as S-protein, a species which associates with the terminal attack complex of complement and renders the complex soluble and unable to insert into target cell membranes (6Kolb W.P. Muller-Eberhard H.J. J. Exp. Med. 1975; 141: 724-735Google Scholar, 7Dahlback B. Podack E.R. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2368-2374Google Scholar). This form of the protein has a molecular weight of approximately 72,000 and exists predominantly as a monomer. Higher yields of vitronectin were achieved using an alternative strategy for purification in which the protein is chemically denatured and isolated by affinity chromatography on a heparin column (8Yatohgo T. Izumi M. Kashiwagi H. Hayashi M. Cell Struct. Funct. 1988; 13: 281-292Google Scholar). The observation that vitronectin from denatured plasma bound to the heparin column, whereas binding of vitronectin from untreated, whole plasma was minimal, led to a model in which the heparin-binding site in vitronectin is cryptic in the native protein (9Preissner K.T. Muller-Berghaus G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 156: 645-650Google Scholar, 10Preissner K.T. Muller-Berghaus G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12247-12253Google Scholar). After quite some time it was realized that the heparin affinity-based purification of vitronectin yielded a high molecular weight form of the protein comprised of multiple vitronectin subunits (11Bittorf S.V. Williams E.C. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24838-24846Google Scholar, 12Hogasen K. Mollnes T.E. Harboe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23076-23082Google Scholar). Chemical denaturation of vitronectin (13Tomasini B.R. Owen M.C. Fenton II, J.W. Mosher D.F. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7617-7623Google Scholar, 14Tomasini B.R. Mosher D.F. Blood. 1988; 72: 903-912Google Scholar), as well as macromolecular association with the thrombin-antithrombin III (13Tomasini B.R. Owen M.C. Fenton II, J.W. Mosher D.F. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7617-7623Google Scholar, 14Tomasini B.R. Mosher D.F. Blood. 1988; 72: 903-912Google Scholar) or the complement C5b-9 complex (12Hogasen K. Mollnes T.E. Harboe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23076-23082Google Scholar, 15Hildebrand A. Preissner K.T. Muller-Berghaus G. Teschemacher H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15429-15434Google Scholar), has been associated with a conformational transition of vitronectin to an altered form which is detected using monoclonal antibodies. Differences in functional reactivity of native and altered forms of vitronectin were initially demonstrated by changes in heparin-binding properties (13Tomasini B.R. Owen M.C. Fenton II, J.W. Mosher D.F. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7617-7623Google Scholar), and differences between the conformers have since been observed in interactions with plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (16Gechtman Z. Sharma R. Kreizman T. Fridkin M. Shaltiel S. FEBS Lett. 1993; 315: 293-297Google Scholar, 17Chain D. Korc-Grodzicki B. Kreizman T. Shaltiel S. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 387-394Google Scholar, 18Naski M.C.

Chem. 1986; 261: 16698-16703Google Scholar), urokinase receptor (20Wei Y. Waltz D.A. Rao N. Drummond R.J. Rosenberg S. Chapman H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32380-32388Google Scholar), β-endorphin (15Hildebrand A. Preissner K.T. Muller-Berghaus G. Teschemacher H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15429-15434Google Scholar), and whole cells (21Zanetti A. Conforti G. Hess S. Martin-Padura I. Ghibaudi E. Preissner K.T. Dejana E. Blood. 1994; 84: 1116-1123Google Scholar). Furthermore, different forms of vitronectin exhibit different efficiencies for incorporation into the extracellular matrix (22Panetti T.S. McKeown-Longo P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11988-11993Google Scholar, 23Panetti T.S. McKeown-Longo P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11492-11495Google Scholar). Indeed, immunological evidence suggests that this altered form of vitronectin, only detected in plasma in minor amounts, may be the predominant form of the protein found in extravascular sites (24Preissner K.T. Grulich-Henn J. Ehrlich H.J. Declerck P. Justus C. Collen D. Pannekoek H. Muller-Berghaus G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18490-18498Google Scholar). Recently, attention has turned to structural characterization of the native and conformationally altered forms of vitronectin and the mechanism for conversion of the protein between alternative conformations. Initial demonstrations of altered immunoreactivity and heparin-binding properties were extended by Stockmann et al. (25Stockmann A. Hess S. Declerck P. Timpl R. Preissner K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22874-22882Google Scholar), who demonstrated the propensity of vitronectin to self-associate into multimers upon treatment with chaotropes, detergents, extreme pH, or heat. Conformation-specific monoclonal antibodies were used extensively by these authors to demonstrate that structural alterations generally precede formation of the multimeric species with altered heparin binding. However, immunoreactivity varied according to individual epitopes recognized by monoclonal antibodies, as well as according to the stimulus used to induce self-association. A similar analysis of reactivity of native and heat-denatured vitronectin with a separate panel of monoclonal antibodies also indicated structural alterations which are not limited to the heparin-binding region of the protein (26Seiffert D. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 155-159Google Scholar). Bittorf et al. (11Bittorf S.V. Williams E.C. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24838-24846Google Scholar) demonstrated an apparently irreversible conversion of vitronectin from a monomeric species to the oligomeric form to depend on the concentration of denaturant, with a transition in the range between 2 and 4 M urea. These in vitro studies point to the likelihood that conformationally altered forms of vitronectin found in vivo are also multimeric in nature. A detailed analysis of the unfolding of vitronectin and refolding to a multimeric form is presented in this study, along with an evaluation of potential models for the mechanism of self-association of the protein in an accompanying report (27Zhuang P. Li H. Williams J.G. Wagner N. Seiffert D. Peterson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 270: 14333-14343Google Scholar). Spectroscopic and hydrodynamic methods are used to evaluate structural changes which characterize unfolding and refolding of vitronectin. Particular attention is paid to the following questions. Is unfolding/refolding of native or multimeric vitronectin reversible? How do the different conformational forms of vitronectin differ according to secondary and tertiary structure? Do chemical denaturation and heat treatment of vitronectin yield the same conformer upon renaturation? To what extent is multimeric vitronectin stabilized by covalent intermolecular linkages? Vitronectin was purified by a modification of the original procedure of Dahlback and Podack (7Dahlback B. Podack E.R. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2368-2374Google Scholar), essentially as described by Bittorf et al. (11Bittorf S.V. Williams E.C. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24838-24846Google Scholar). Purity was assessed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of β-mercaptoethanol (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). The molecular weight of the protein was determined to be 72,000 by equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation (described below), and an extinction coefficient of 1.02 ml·mg−1·cm−1 was explicitly determined from the amino acid composition derived from a total amino acid hydrolysis on a protein sample of known absorbance. Multimeric vitronectin was prepared by treatment of protein in 8 M urea at room temperature for 2 h, with subsequent removal of denaturant by dialysis into standard phosphate buffer (0.1 M sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, containing 0.15 M NaCl, and 1 mM EDTA). Similar methods were used by both Stockmann et al. (25Stockmann A. Hess S. Declerck P. Timpl R. Preissner K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22874-22882Google Scholar) and Bittorf et al. (11Bittorf S.V. Williams E.C. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24838-24846Google Scholar) to prepare the multimeric form of vitronectin. Heat-denatured vitronectin was prepared by incubating the protein in standard phosphate buffer at 55°C for 2 h and subsequent cooling on ice (25Stockmann A. Hess S. Declerck P. Timpl R. Preissner K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22874-22882Google Scholar, 26Seiffert D. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 155-159Google Scholar). Ultrapure guanidine hydrochloride was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Urea was a product of ICN biomedical. All other chemicals were of reagent grade quality. high performance liquid chromatography guanidine hydrochloride polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. high performance liquid chromatography guanidine hydrochloride polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Native and multimeric proteins were analyzed in standard phosphate buffer by HPLC using a Beckman ultraspherogel SEC2000 column (7.5 mm × 30 cm). Elution of protein from the column was monitored by absorbance at 280 nm. Retention times characteristic of native and multimeric vitronectin were 6.8 ± 0.1 and 5.6 ± 0.1 min, respectively. Equilibrium sedimentation and sedimentation velocity measurements were performed with a Beckman XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman Instruments, Spinco Division). Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed at approximately 20°C using protein concentrations in the range of 0.1 to 0.3 mg·ml−1 in standard phosphate buffer or urea or GdnHCl in the same buffer. Data were collected after equilibrium had been established, generally after 18–24 h, using a rotor speed of 10,000 to 15,000 rpm for experiments on protein in buffer, or 48–72 h, with a rotor speed of 15,000 to 20,000 rpm, for experiments on protein in urea or GdnHCl. The distribution of a single, homogeneous species within the ultracentrifuge cell at equilibrium is given by the equations: cr=cmexp(σ)+base(Eq. 1) σ=M(1−v¯ρ)ω2(r2−rm2)/2RT(Eq. 2) in which cr and cm are the concentrations of the protein at radial position, r, and at a reference position, rm (i.e. the meniscus), respectively. M is the protein molecular weight, is the partial specific volume, equal to 0.73 ml·g−1, ω is the angular velocity, R is the gas constant, T is absolute temperature, and base is a term for non-sedimenting baseline absorbance. Solvent density, ρ, was estimated to be 1.018 for the buffer, and the density of guanidine or urea solutions was calculated according to Kawahara and Tanford (29Kawahara K. Tanford C. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 3228-3232Google Scholar). For the analysis of samples containing multiple sedimenting species, e.g. monomer, dimer, etc., the concentration distribution can be written as the sum of the distributions for the individual species, i, as: cr=∑cm,iexp(σi)+base(Eq. 3) Data were analyzed using nonlinear least squares methods, as described by Brooks et al. (30Brooks I. Wetzel R. Chan W. Lee G. Watts D.G. Soneson K.K. Hensley P. Shuster T.M. Laue T.M. Modern Analytical Ultracentrifugation: Acquisition and Interpretation of Data for Biological and Synthetic Polymer Systems. Birkhauser, Boston1994: 15Google Scholar, 31Brooks I. Watts D.G. Soneson K.K. Hensley P. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 240: 459-478Google Scholar), using IGOR (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR) on a Macintosh computer. Sedimentation velocity data were likewise analyzed using the IGOR software package. After reaching full centrifugation speed of 60,000 rpm, data sets were collected at 4–8-min intervals, with at least 10 data sets collected per run. The sedimentation coefficient, s20,w, was determined from the slope of a plot of ln rmversus ω2t. Unfolding of vitronectin was induced by GdnHCl or urea and monitored by changes in intrinsic protein fluorescence. Protein fluorescence measurements were made on a Perkin-Elmer LS-50B spectrofluorimeter. Emission spectra were recorded between 300 and 450 nm using an excitation wavelength of 290 nm and a pathlength of 1 cm. Changes in emission spectra were quantified as the average emission wavelength, which was calculated according to the following expression: λ¯=∑λiIi∑Ii(Eq. 4) where λi and Ii are the emission wavelength and its corresponding fluorescence intensity at that wavelength (32Royer C.A. Mann C.J. Matthews C.R. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1844-1852Google Scholar). To facilitate comparison between different experiments, the average emission wavelength at any denaturant concentration is converted to Fapp, the fraction of unfolded protein, by the equation Fapp = (λobs−λF)/(λU−λF) in which λF and λU are the average emission wavelengths associated with folded and unfolded proteins, respectively. Buffer used for the unfolding and refolding experiments was standard phosphate buffer containing 0.04% Tween 20. GdnHCl and urea concentrations were calculated using equations relating refractive indexes to concentrations (33Pace C.N. Shirley B.A. Thomsom J.A. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1990: 311Google Scholar), and refractive indexes were measured using a Zeiss refractometer. Urea solutions were made fresh daily. Quenching of tryptophan fluorescence was performed by addition of sodium iodide as described by Lakowicz (34Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983: 258Google Scholar). Sodium iodide was dissolved in standard phosphate buffer to a final concentration of 5 M, and aliquots were added to solutions of vitronectin (0.1 µM) in standard phosphate buffer or 7 M GdnHCl. The excitation wavelength was 290 nm, and emission was measured at the maximum wavelength observed in the emission spectra, 340, 351, and 350 nm, for native, multimeric, or fully denatured protein, respectively. Circular dichroism measurements were made on a Jasco Model J710 Spectrapolarimeter at 22°C using a cell with a pathlength of 0.02 cm. The average of four accumulations is reported, using a 1-nm band width, 1-nm step resolution, 50 nm·min−1 scan rate, and 2-s response time. Instrument sensitivity was set at 20 millidegrees. Protein concentration was 0.95 mg·ml−1 in 0.1 M sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, containing 0.15 M NaCl. Spectra were collected for protein in buffer and protein in buffer plus 6.5 M GdnHCl under the same conditions. A mean residue molecular weight of 113.8 was used. Studies of protein folding generally rely on one or more probes of structure and function, monitoring changes in those parameters as denaturation conditions are varied. In order to more fully characterize the unfolding transition of vitronectin, spectroscopic methods were evaluated to reliably monitor structural alterations which accompany the unfolding transition for this particular protein. Fig. 1 shows far UV circular dichroism spectra for vitronectin under native and highly denaturing (6.5 M GdnHCl) conditions. The spectrum for the native protein, which has been reported by Pitt et al. (35Pitt W.G. Fabrizius-Homan D.J. Mosher D.F. Cooper S.L. J. Colloid Interface Sci. 1989; 129: 231-239Google Scholar), exhibits a gradual slope from approximately 230 nm, with a trough near 205 nm. This spectrum is characteristic of a protein with predominant β-sheet and random fold character, with little α-helical content. 2The CD spectrum for the multimeric form of vitronectin does not differ substantially in overall shape from that recorded for the native, monomeric protein. The spectrum for denatured vitronectin exhibits loss of negative ellipticity in the 215–230 nm region, with a concomitant increase in negative ellipticity in the vicinity of the 205-nm trough. Spectra could not be accurately measured below 207 nm on protein samples in denaturant solutions due to absorption of guanidine. Intrinsic fluorescence of vitronectin was also perturbed upon chemical denaturation (Fig. 2). Denaturation of vitronectin is associated with an increase in quantum yield, along with a red shift in emission maximum, expected upon exposure of buried tryptophan residues to a more hydrophilic environment upon unfolding. Changes observed in both circular dichroism and fluorescence indicate loss of secondary and tertiary structure upon chemical denaturation. Since accurate measurements cannot be obtained by CD due to absorption by the denaturant in the region where ellipticity changes appear to be the greatest, detailed characterization of the unfolding transition of vitronectin was pursued exclusively using the fluorescence method. Changes in fluorescence emission maxima for vitronectin were monitored as a function of chemical denaturant using either GdnHCl (Fig. 3A) or urea (Fig. 3B). Unfolding of vitronectin in GdnHCl occurs at a lower concentration of denaturant than in urea, with midpoints of 3.2 M and 5.9 M denaturant, respectively. The unfolding transition of vitronectin occurs over a narrow concentration range in GdnHCl, compared to the more gradual denaturation observed over the broad range from 3 to 9 M urea. The unfolding curves in either chemical denaturant are indistinguishable for vitronectin concentrations varied over a 10-fold range (Fig. 3), indicating that there are no association or dissociation phenomena which accompany unfolding of the protein. Table I lists the midpoints for denaturation of vitronectin measured for both denaturants using different protein concentrations.Table I.Behavior of native and multimeric vitronectin in chemical denaturation/renaturation experimentsVitronectin sampleaSamples are labeled according to the state of the starting material for the experiment as: native, corresponding to the untreated monomeric protein; multimeric, corresponding to the chemically denatured then renatured form of the protein; and heat treated, corresponding to the protein heated to 55°C as described under “Experimental Procedures.”DenaturantMidpoint (M)FbThe intensity averaged wavelength corresponding to folded, F, or unfolded, U, protein.

Open table in a new tab The aggregation state of vitronectin in the presence and absence of chemical denaturants was evaluated by sedimentation equilibrium in an analytical ultracentrifuge. This technique is considered to be the most reliable for determining molecular weight and is ideally suited for examining association and dissociation phenomena. Fig. 4A shows a representative data set with a diagnostic distribution of native protein at equilibrium from the meniscus, which is depleted of protein, to the bottom of the centrifugation cell, which contains a high concentration of protein. The smooth curve represents a fit to a single species, which yielded a molecular weight of 73,800 for this data set, and residuals shown in Fig. 4B. The homogeneity of the sample is noteworthy, with no evidence for even small amounts of multimeric vitronectin in the preparation. Data from a representative equilibrium centrifugation experiment on vitronectin unfolded in a high concentration of GdnHCl is shown in Fig. 4C, again with a smooth curve through the data representing a fit to a single species of molecular weight 70,900 and the residuals of the fit shown in Fig. 4D. Clearly, there is no association of vitronectin to form multimers in the presence of GdnHCl, as not even a small amount of high molecular weight protein is detected by this method. Sedimentation velocity experiments at 60,000 rpm were used to verify this conclusion; at these high centrifugation speeds, there were no faster sedimenting species and the unfolded monomer was observed as the only form of vitronectin present (data not shown). Table II summarizes results from equilibrium sedimentation analysis of vitronectin, using a variety of experimental conditions.Table II.Molecular weight determinations for vitronectin samples under native and denaturing conditionsVitronectin sampleaSamples are labeled according to the state of the starting material for the experiment as: native, corresponding to the untreated monomeric protein; multimeric, corresponding to the chemically denatured then renatured form of the protein; and heat treated, corresponding to the protein heated to 55°C as described under “Experimental Procedures.”SolventSedimentation velocity experiments, s20,wSedimentation equilibrium experimentsMrAverage MrNativePBSbPhosphate-buffered saline (40 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, containing 0.15 M NaCl).4.1 S72,40073,100NativeBuffercUnless otherwise noted, buffer is standard phosphate buffer.73,800Native8.76 M Urea77,30073,700Native8.02 M Urea70,100Native7.08 M GdnHCl71,300Native6.53 M GdnHCl70,90070,600Native5.98 M GdnHCl69,700MultimerBuffercUnless otherwise noted, buffer is standard phosphate buffer.11 S∼420,000Multimer6.0 M GdnHCl∼70% Monomer, Mr = 72,000∼30% Disulfide-linked speciesHeat-treatedBuffercUnless otherwise noted, buffer is standard phosphate buffer.22 Sa Samples are labeled according to the state of the starting material for the experiment as: native, corresponding to the untreated monomeric protein; multimeric, corresponding to the chemically denatured then renatured form of the protein; and heat treated, corresponding to the protein heated to 55°C as described under “Experimental Procedures.”b Phosphate-buffered saline (40 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, containing 0.15 M NaCl).c Unless otherwise noted, buffer is standard phosphate buffer. Open table in a new tab Early in the work evaluating chemical denaturation of vitronectin, it was observed that unfolding of the protein occurs on an extremely slow time scale. Precautions were observed to establish that equilibrium had been reached in the denaturation process since one of the original goals for this study was to evaluate the thermodynamics of unfolding of vitronectin. The kinetics of unfolding of vitronectin at two different concentrations of denaturant are shown in Fig. 5. As expected, the slowest rate of unfolding is observed at denaturant concentrations close to the midpoint in the unfolding curve. Unfolding is complete only after chemical treatment for many hours, with small changes in fluorescence at 3 M GdnHCl observed even up to 24-h incubation times. Extremely slow unfolding has been observed with other proteins and has in some cases confused interpretation of energetics of unfolding (36Steif C. Weber P. Hinz H.J. Flossdorf J. Cesareni G. Kokkinidis J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3867-3876Google Scholar, 37Munson M. O'Brien R. Sturtevant J.M. Regan L. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2015-2022Google Scholar). For this reason, equilibrium unfolding of vitronectin was explicitly tested by evaluating the reversibility of the chemically-induced unfolding reaction. Refolding of vitronectin was measured by first treating the protein with high concentrations of chemical denaturant for 16 h and then allowing refolding to proceed in varying mixtures of denaturant and buffer for long time periods. The refolding behavior exhibited by vitronectin treated with GdnHCl and urea is plotted, along with the unfolding curves measured in both chemical denaturants, in Fig. 6. Hysteresis in refolding versus unfolding curves is observed with both types of denaturants, with the most pronounced differences exhibited for GdnHCl treatment. 3Indeed, the marked dissimilarity observed between unfolding and refolding of vitronectin in GdnHCl spurred our re-evaluation of earlier data in urea (40Peterson C.B. Preissner K.T. Rosenblatt S. Kost C. Wegerhoff J. Biology of Vitronectins and Their Receptors. Elsevier, Amsterdam1993: 67Google Scholar), in which the observed differences were not as obvious, and supported the interpretation that observed variations represent true differences in unfolding and refolding patterns rather than imprecision in measurements. The non-identical nature of the unfolding and refolding curves for vitronectin indicates either that unfolding and refolding proceed by different pathways, or that the starting and ending protein species are chemically distinct. Table I summarizes the results from the unfolding and refolding studies performed on vitronectin with both GdnHCl and urea, including the midpoints for the denaturatio"

We investigated the effects of the lipid composition of emulsion particles, specifically those of cholesterol enrichment and core replacement (replacing core triglyceride with cholesteryl oleate), on the physical states of surface and core lipids. Steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence anisotropies were measured in lipid emulsions using 1,6-diphenylhexatriene to probe the core and 1,6-diphenylhexatriene analogues for the outer and inner hydrophobic portions of surface phospholipids. In the absence of cholesterol, core replacement had little effect on the surface rigidity, despite the large difference in core mobility. However, core replacement caused a marked increase in surface rigidity in the presence of cholesterol. Quenching experiments using the fluorescent cholesterol analogue, dehydroergosterol, indicated that core replacement allowed surface dehydroergosterol to redistribute from the inner to the outer regions in the emulsion surface. These results indicated that core replacement modulates the surface properties of the emulsion particles through the redistribution of cholesterol in the surface layers. Furthermore, core replacement significantly decreased the binding of apolipoprotein E to the emulsion surface, whereas the binding of apolipoprotein CII responded to the cholesterol enrichment. This binding behavior of exchangeable apolipoproteins may closely correlate with the location of surface cholesterol and the mobility of core lipids.

Human plasma chylomicrons, very low density lipoproteins, and high density lipoproteins contain apolipoprotein E (apoE), 1The abbreviations used are: apoE and apoCIIapolipoproteins E and CII, respectivelyTGtriglycerideLDLlow density lipoproteinCholcholesterolCOcholesteryl oleateDPH1,6-diphenylhexatrieneTMA-DPH1-[4-(trimethylamino)phenyl]phenylhexatrieneDPHpPC1-palmitoyl-2-[3-(diphenylhexatrienyl)propionyl]-sn-3-phosphatidylcholinePCegg yolk phosphatidylcholine. which plays a crucial role in lipoprotein metabolism through specific interactions with cell membrane receptors (1Mahley R.W. Science. 1988; 240: 622-630Google Scholar). In triglyceride (TG)-rich lipoproteins such as chylomicrons and very low density lipoproteins, the hydrolysis of core TG by lipoprotein lipase produces remnant particles that are rapidly recognized by cell receptors and taken up into the liver through receptor-mediated endocytosis (2Atkinson D. Small D.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1986; 15: 403-456Google Scholar, 3Small D.M. Kreisberg R.A. Segrest J.P. Plasma Lipoproteins and Coronary Artery Disease.

Alternatively, the apoE-mediated uptake of TG-rich particles by cell receptors is partially inhibited by other apolipoproteins that are associated with these lipoproteins, e.g. apolipoprotein Cs (5Weisgraber K.H.

Thus, the transfer of apolipoprotein Cs and apoE to and from TG-rich lipoproteins exerts profound effects on their capacity to interact with cell receptors and, therefore, has a major regulating effect on plasma TG transport and on the remnant removal processes. apolipoproteins E and CII, respectively triglyceride low density lipoprotein cholesterol cholesteryl oleate 1,6-diphenylhexatriene 1-[4-(trimethylamino)phenyl]phenylhexatriene 1-palmitoyl-2-[3-(diphenylhexatrienyl)propionyl]-sn-3-phosphatidylcholine egg yolk phosphatidylcholine. Several studies have shown that the lipid composition of lipoproteins and lipid emulsions influence their metabolic properties. The modulation of core TG content of low density lipoproteins (LDL; 7Aviram M. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Chait A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16842-16848Google Scholar) and the lipid emulsions (8Quarfordt S.H. Landis B.A. Oswald B.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1255: 82-86Google Scholar) alters the cellular uptake of these particles. The increase in the cholesterol (Chol) concentration of LDL leads to reduced uptake by macrophages (9Aviram M. Keidar S. Rosenblat M. Brook G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11567-11574Google Scholar), and the amount of free Chol also regulates the emulsion metabolism (10Maranhao R.C. Tercyak A.M. Redgrave T.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 875: 247-255Google Scholar, 11Redgrave T.G. Vassiliou G.G. Callow M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 921: 154-157Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated the effects of Chol and cholesteryl oleate (CO) on the metabolic process of the emulsions through lipolysis of TG and organ uptake (12Handa T. Eguchi Y. Miyajima K. Pharm. Res. 1994; 11: 1283-1287Google Scholar). These alterations in the metabolic behavior are thought to arise from changes in the conformation and binding properties of apolipoproteins. A close relationship between conformational changes in apolipoproteins and the thermal transition of surface and core lipids has been suggested (13Mims M.P. Soma M.R. Morrisett J.D. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6639-6647Google Scholar, 14Bañuelos S. Arrondo J.L.R. Goni F.M. Pifat G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9192-9196Google Scholar). Although the modification of surface and core lipid composition may play a role in the organization and the dynamics of lipids, little is known about the effect of the surface and core modifications on the motional state of lipids in lipoproteins and the emulsions. In this study, we examined the effect of Chol enrichment and of replacing core TG with CO on the physical states of surface and core lipids in lipid emulsions. Emulsion particles containing only TG or CO represent extremes in the composition of lipoprotein core lipids. We assessed differences in the surface and core properties using the fluorescent probes: 1,6-diphenylhexatriene (DPH) for probing the core lipids, as well as 1-[4-(trimethylamino)phenyl]phenylhexatriene (TMA-DPH) and 1-palmitoyl-2-[3-(diphenylhexatrienyl)propionyl]-sn-3-phosphatidylcholine (DPHpPC) for different portions of the surface layers. The DPH moiety of TMA-DPH is located near the phospholipid-water interface, whereas that of DPHpPC is aligned with the phospholipid acyl chains. Thus, the motion of the outer and inner hydrophobic portions of the surface phospholipids can be monitored using TMA-DPH and DPHpPC, respectively. Furthermore, we estimated the relationship between the physical states of the surface and core lipids and the binding affinity of the exchangeable apolipoproteins, apolipoprotein CII (apoCII) and apoE. The results of these fluorescence and apolipoprotein binding studies demonstrated that the physical states of not only surface but also core lipids significantly affect the binding behavior of apolipoproteins. Egg yolk phosphatidylcholine (PC) was kindly provided by Asahi Kasei Co. The purity (over 99.5%) was determined by thin-layer chromatography. Chol and CO were purchased from Sigma and used without further purification. Soybean TG obtained from Nacalai Tesque was purified using silicate (Wakogel C-200; Wako Pure Chemicals) column to remove fatty acids, diglycerides, and monoglycerides. DPH, TMA-DPH, and DPHpPC were purchased from Molecular Probes. Dehydroergosterol was purchased from Sigma. All other chemicals were of special grade from Wako Pure Chemicals. Water was double distilled using a quartz still. TG emulsion particles were prepared as described (15Saito H. Nishiwaki K. Handa T. Ito S. Miyajima K. Langmuir. 1995; 11: 3742-3747Google Scholar) using a high pressure emulsifier (Nanomizer; Nanomizer Inc., Tokyo, Japan). Emulsion particles containing CO instead of TG were prepared in a similar manner: PC (or PC + Chol) and CO were dissolved in chloroform at a molar ratio of 1:2. After removing the solvent, the dried lipids were resuspended in 30 ml of 10 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, and 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4, and emulsified at 1200-1300 kg/cm2 and 60–70°C. The crude emulsions were placed in polyallomer tubes and washed twice with the buffer in a Beckman SW 28 rotor at 27,000 rpm for 1 h to remove any contaminating vesicles. After removing large emulsions by centrifugation in a Beckman 50.1 rotor at 32,000 rpm for 10 min, homogeneous emulsion particles with a diameter of 100–130 nm (determined from quasi-elastic light scattering measurements; Photal LPA-3000/3100; Otsuka Electronic Co.) were obtained. PC vesicles with a diameter of about 100 nm were prepared by an extrusion method as described (15Saito H. Nishiwaki K. Handa T. Ito S. Miyajima K. Langmuir. 1995; 11: 3742-3747Google Scholar). Diluted vesicle or emulsion suspensions were labeled with DPH (in tetrahydrofuran) or TMA-DPH (in dimethyl sulfoxide) to yield PC:probe molar ratios of 200–400:1 or 100–200:1, respectively. For the samples labeled with DPHpPC, lipids and DPHpPC stocks were mixed in chloroform at a PC:probe molar ratio of 200–400:1 before the preparation of vesicles or emulsions. Steady-state fluorescence anisotropy was measured using a SHIMADZU RF-5000 spectrofluorometer at 25°C. Excitation was at 360 nm through HOYA U360 and TOSHIBA UV-31 filters, and emission was measured through a cutoff filter HOYA L42 at 434 nm. Samples were diluted to ensure that anisotropy values were not affected by light scattering. Fluorescence lifetimes and anisotropy decay were measured by a time-correlated single-photon counting method on a HORIBA multichannel-TAC NAES-550 system. The probe was excited through HOYA U360 and TOSHIBA UV-31 filters and detected using a cutoff filter (HOYA L42). The temperature was maintained at 25°C. The total fluorescence decay S(t) was analyzed with an exponential decay function with the fractional amplitudes αi and the lifetimes τi. S(t)=∑i=1nαiexp(−t/τi)(Eq. 1) The mean lifetime τ was defined as follows. τ=∑i=1nαiτi2/∑i=1nαiτi(Eq. 2) The fluorescence anisotropy r(t) is expressed by the equation, r(t)=I∥(t)−GI⊥(t)I∥(t)+2GI⊥(t)(Eq. 3) where I∥(t) and I⊥(t) are the parallel and perpendicular polarized components of the fluorescence, respectively, and G represents the compensating factor for the anisotropy sensitivity of the instrument. According to the wobble-in-cone model, r(t) is expressed as (16Lipari G. Szabo A. Biophys. J. 1980; 30: 489-506Google Scholar, 17Lehrer S.S. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 3254-3263Google Scholar, 18Li Q.-T. Sawyer W.H. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 503-512Google Scholar), r(t)=(r0−r∞)exp(−t/ϕ)+r∞(Eq. 4) where φ is the rotational correlation time, r0 is the initial anisotropy at t = 0, and r∞ is the residual anisotropy at infinite time. The order parameter S and the cone angle θc were calculated using the following equation. S=r∞r01/2=12cosθc(1+cosθc)(Eq. 5) The wobbling diffusion constant DW was estimated as follows (16Lipari G. Szabo A. Biophys. J. 1980; 30: 489-506Google Scholar), Dwϕ(1−S2)=−x2(1−x)2{ln[(1+x)/2]+(1−x)/2}/[2(1−x)]+(1−x)(6+8x-x2−12x3−7x4)/24(Eq. 6) where x = cos θc (Fig. 1). Dehydroergosterol quenching experiments were performed at an excitation wavelength of 328 nm at 25°C. Dehydroergosterol was incorporated into emulsions and vesicles by replacing 20% of the Chol during the preparation process. Aliquots of sodium iodide were added to the emulsion or vesicle suspensions in increasing amounts, from a 5 M stock solution containing 1 mM Na2S2O3 to prevent I−3 formation. After each addition of the quencher, the emission spectra were recorded from 360 to 440 nm, and the areas under each peak were calculated. The values were corrected for dilution and scatter contribution by sodium iodide titration of an emulsion or vesicle blank. Quenching data were analyzed according to the modified Stern-Volmer equation for collisional quenching (17Lehrer S.S. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 3254-3263Google Scholar, 18Li Q.-T. Sawyer W.H. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 503-512Google Scholar), F0/(F0−F)=1/(faKSV[Q])+1/fa(Eq. 7) whereF0 and F are the fluorescence emissions in the absence and presence of quencher, respectively, KSV is the Stern-Volmer constant for the collisional quenching process, [Q] is the quencher concentration, and fa is the fraction of accessible fluorophores. From the slope and the ordinate intercept of the modified Stern-Volmer plot, KSV and fa were obtained. Human serum was centrifuged for 1.5 h at 27,000 rpm in the Beckman SW 28 rotor to remove the top fraction containing chylomicrons. Emulsions containing 2–5 µmol of total lipid were added to 2 ml of the chylomicron-free serum and incubated for 20 min at 37°C. The mixtures were centrifuged for 20 min at 32,000 rpm in a Beckman SW 50.1 rotor, resulting in a clear and emulsion-free supernatant. The equilibrium concentrations of apoCII and apoE in the supernatant were determined in single radial immunodiffusion assay plates, purchased from Dai-ichi Pure Chemicals (Tokyo, Japan). The amount of apolipoproteins bound to the emulsions was calculated from the difference between the apolipoprotein concentrations before and after the incubation with the emulsions. The phospholipid concentration was determined by the phosphorus assay according to the method of Bartlett (19Bartlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 466-468Google Scholar). The concentrations of other lipids were determined using enzymatic assay kits for TG and free and total Chol, purchased from Wako Pure Chemicals. Fig. 2 shows the steady-state anisotropy of DPH, TMA-DPH, and DPHpPC for vesicles and emulsions. Although both the surface and core phases of emulsions are accessible to DPH, we confirmed that over 95% of DPH was located in the core from the partition analysis of DPH between the surface and core phases. The anisotropy value of DPH in CO-PC emulsions was much higher than that for TG-PC emulsions, consistent with the fact that TG is a disordered liquid, whereas CO exists as a smectic-like ordered structure at that temperature (20Ginsburg G.S. Small D.M. Atkinson D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8216-8227Google Scholar). However, the difference in the core mobility between these emulsions had a small effect on the anisotropy of the surface layers. As shown in Fig. 2, the anisotropy value in CO-PC emulsions was similar for TMA-DPH and slightly higher for DPHpPC compared with those in TG-PC emulsions. For both surface probes, the anisotropy in TG-PC and CO-PC emulsions exhibited higher values than that in vesicles (15Saito H. Nishiwaki K. Handa T. Ito S. Miyajima K. Langmuir. 1995; 11: 3742-3747Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows the fluorescence anisotropy of TMA-DPH in TG-PC and CO-PC emulsions as a function of the surface mole percent of Chol. We have reported the characteristics of TG-PC emulsion particles in terms of the lipid composition and surface distribution of Chol (15Saito H. Nishiwaki K. Handa T. Ito S. Miyajima K. Langmuir. 1995; 11: 3742-3747Google Scholar). Although PC and Chol compositions of CO-PC emulsion particles were similar to those in TG-PC emulsions, the surface content of Chol in CO-PC emulsions tends to be smaller than those in TG-PC emulsions due to the smaller distribution coefficient of Chol between the surface and the core (2Atkinson D. Small D.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1986; 15: 403-456Google Scholar). Chol showed a delayed rigidification of the TG-PC emulsion surface (15Saito H. Nishiwaki K. Handa T. Ito S. Miyajima K. Langmuir. 1995; 11: 3742-3747Google Scholar), while the anisotropy values in CO-PC emulsions increased rather linearly with the increasing surface content of Chol (Fig. 3). In contrast, the anisotropy values of DPHpPC increased with surface Chol in a similar manner in both emulsions (Fig. 3, inset). These results indicated that, in general, Chol affected the rigidity of the surface layers both in TG-PC and CO-PC emulsions, but this depended on the depth of the surface layers, i.e. the outer and inner layers in TG-PC emulsions. We further investigated the effect of Chol on the molecular orientation and dynamics of DPHpPC in surface layers of vesicles and emulsions using time-resolved fluorescence measurements. Since DPHpPC itself is a phospholipid analogue, it should reflect the motional dynamics of phospholipid molecules in the membrane. Fig. 4 shows the typical fluorescence decay of DPHpPC, and Table I summarizes the results of the time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy and lifetime measurements of DPHpPC. Both in vesicles and emulsions, the fluorescence decay of DPHpPC was accurately represented by the biexponential fit with the minor lifetime component in the absence of Chol, whereas the monoexponential fit showed satisfactorily low χ2 values in the presence of Chol. An increasing amount of Chol led to a modest increase in the mean lifetime τ, both in vesicles and in the emulsions as shown in Table I. Since Chol is known to exert a “homogenizing” effect in lipid bilayers due to a decrease in membrane water permeability (21Kalb E. Paltauf F. Hermetter A. Biophys. J. 1989; 56: 1245-1253Google Scholar, 22Li Q.-T. Das N.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 315: 473-478Google Scholar), these results indicated that Chol exerts the same effect in emulsion surface layers. In addition, the lifetime of DPHpPC was shorter in the emulsion surface than in the vesicles, indicating that the more polar environment of DPHpPC probably arose from the presence of adjacent core lipids with ester bonds. The values of the order parameter, S, the rotational correlation time, φ, the cone angle, θc, and the wobbling diffusion constant, DW, are also given in Table I. In the absence of Chol, DPHpPC was more ordered in the emulsion surface than in vesicles, as reflected by the increase in the order parameter and the decrease in the cone angle. However, the rate of rotational motion reflected in the values of φ and DW remained unaltered in TG-PC emulsions but decreased in those in CO-PC, as compared with the vesicles. Chol increased the order and decreased the rotational motion for all vesicles and emulsions. In the presence of a high content of Chol (40 mol%), the difference in the order between the vesicles and the emulsions disappeared, but the rotational motion in CO-PC emulsions seemed to remain slower than that in vesicles and TG-PC emulsions. Based on the finding that the effect of Chol on the surface rigidity differed between TG-PC and CO-PC emulsions, we considered that the location of Chol might be different in the surface layers between the two emulsions. To investigate this possibility, we performed quenching experiments using the fluorescent Chol analogue, dehydroergosterol. This compound is a close structural analogue of Chol, and it has a similar surface-core distribution coefficient in emulsions (23Li Q.-T. Sawyer W.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1166: 145-153Google Scholar). Iodide was used as an aqueous-phase quencher, which is considered to access only surface dehydroergosterol. Table II shows the Stern-Volmer quenching constant KSV and the fraction of accessible dehydroergosterol fa for the vesicles and the emulsions containing Chol (20 mol%). The predicted fa values were calculated from the lamellarity determined by 31P nuclear magnetic resonance for PC vesicles (15Saito H. Nishiwaki K. Handa T. Ito S. Miyajima K. Langmuir. 1995; 11: 3742-3747Google Scholar) and from the lipid composition using surface-core distribution coefficient values of 19.4 for TG-PC emulsions (15Saito H. Nishiwaki K. Handa T. Ito S. Miyajima K. Langmuir. 1995; 11: 3742-3747Google Scholar) and 6 for CO-PC emulsions (2Atkinson D. Small D.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1986; 15: 403-456Google Scholar). For all vesicles and emulsions, the KSV values were similar, but dehydroergosterol in TG-PC emulsions seemed to be less exposed to the quencher than that in those of CO-PC. In PC vesicles and CO-PC emulsions, the fa values obtained from modified Stern-Volmer plots were identical to the predicted values, whereas the observed fa value was significantly lower than that predicted for TG-PC emulsions, indicating that there is a compartment of dehydroergosterol inaccessible to the aqueous phase in surface layers of TG-PC emulsions. We examined the binding of the exchangeable apolipoproteins, apoCII and apoE, to the emulsion surface in human serum to investigate the effect of the lipid composition of the emulsions on the binding behavior of apolipoproteins. As shown in Table III, apoCII and apoE readily associated with TG-PC emulsions when incubated with serum, where apoCII had a markedly higher binding capacity than apoE for all emulsions examined (24Tajima S. Yokoyama S. Yamamoto A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10073-10082Google Scholar, 25Yokoyama S. Kawai Y. Tajima S. Yamamoto A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 16375-16382Google Scholar). The addition of Chol to TG-PC emulsions remarkably reduced the amount of bound apoCII, whereas there was a slight decrease in apoE binding. Replacing core TG with CO in the emulsions more effectively reduced the binding of apoE than of apoCII. Both apoCII and apoE failed to bind to the surface of emulsion particles consisting of a high content of Chol (40 mol%) and core CO. Previous study has shown that the surface monolayers of TG-PC emulsion particles are more rigid than PC bilayers by means of steady-state anisotropy and lifetime measurements of TMA-DPH (15Saito H. Nishiwaki K. Handa T. Ito S. Miyajima K. Langmuir. 1995; 11: 3742-3747Google Scholar). In this study, we measured the time-resolved anisotropy decay of DPHpPC in bilayers and emulsion surface layers to obtain information about the structure and dynamics in the inner surface layers. The S and φ values in Table I show that the surface layers of TG-PC emulsions were more ordered than PC bilayers, whereas the rotational motion of surface lipids in TG-PC emulsions was similar to that for bilayers. These results could be explained on the basis of the interaction between surface and core lipids. The surface monolayer of vesicles abuts the fatty acyl chains of the inner phospholipid monolayer, whereas the monolayer of emulsion particles abuts the neutral lipid core. The acyl chains of core TG, therefore, could partially penetrate into the hydrophobic interior of surface monolayers in TG-PC emulsions, resulting in a restriction of motional freedom and consequently, an increase in the order of acyl chains of the surface PC in the emulsions. However, the rotational motion itself of surface layers in TG-PC emulsions was not affected by partial penetration of the core TG, probably because of the similar mobility of TG and PC acyl chains (see the data for DPH in Fig. 2). This interpretation is further supported by the data for CO-PC emulsions. That is, the partial penetration of core CO increased the order of surface PC in CO-PC emulsions in a similar manner to TG-PC emulsions, whereas the rotational motion of surface PC in the former was more restricted than in those of the latter, because the structure of core CO is more ordered than that of TG. Another interpretation of the different effect of core TG and CO on the rotational motion of surface PC is as follows. The Chol moiety of CO penetrates into surface layers as well as the acyl chain moiety of CO, whereas TG has only acyl chains that penetrate into surface layers. The interaction of core CO with surface PC thus may cause an increase in the order and a decrease in the rotational motion of PC acyl chains, as usually seen in the effect of Chol on PC acyl chains (Table I). The interaction of the surface phospholipids with the core lipids in the emulsion particles is known to cause broadening (26Li Q.-T. Tilley L. Sawyer W.H. Looney F. Curtain C.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1042: 42-50Google Scholar) and an elevation in the temperature (20Ginsburg G.S. Small D.M. Atkinson D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8216-8227Google Scholar, 27Mims M.P. Guyton J.R. Morrisett J.D. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 474-483Google Scholar) of the phase transition of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine monolayers in the emulsions. We also found that the phase transition of the dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine in TG-dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine emulsions was significantly broadened as compared with that for dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine bilayer vesicles. 2H. Saito, T. Minamida, I. Arimoto, T. Handa, and K. Miyajima, unpublished data. In contrast to these profound differences in the organization and dynamics of the surface lipids between the emulsion particles and the vesicles, the physical state of the core lipids seemed to have a minor influence on the surface properties. Although the core lipids were more ordered in CO-PC emulsions than in TG-PC emulsions, there was little difference in the anisotropy of the outer surface probe, TMA-DPH (Fig. 2). These results are consistent with the findings that the motional states of the surface and core lipids are relatively independent in reconstituted LDL (28Kroon P.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4879-4884Google Scholar). It is likely that the physical state of core lipids in LDL influences the apolipoprotein B conformation, not through an alteration in surface structure but through the direct interaction of apolipoprotein B with the core lipids, as suggested by Bañuelos et al. (14Bañuelos S. Arrondo J.L.R. Goni F.M. Pifat G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9192-9196Google Scholar). Chol can distribute between the surface and core phases in lipid emulsions (29Miller K.W. Small D.M. J. Colloid Interface Sci. 1982; 89: 466-478Google Scholar, 30Miller K.W. Small D.M. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 443-451Google Scholar) and lipoproteins (31Miller K.W. Small D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 13772-13784Google Scholar). Although Chol preferentially partitions into the surface, the incorporation of CO into core TGs increases the distribution of Chol into the core phase, arising from the association of Chol with CO in the core (2Atkinson D. Small D.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1986; 15: 403-456Google Scholar). From the surface-core phase equilibrium consideration, we estimated that over 80% of the Chol was associated with the surface phase in TG-PC emulsions studied here, whereas only about one-half of the Chol was located at the surface in CO-PC emulsions. Chol significantly affects the structure and physical properties of bilayers. Chol is considered to be located so that the 3β-hydroxyl is in the immediate vicinity of the phospholipid ester carbonyl (32Yeagle P.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 822: 267-287Google Scholar, 33Finean J.B. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1990; 54: 147-156Google Scholar), probably due to hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl of Chol and the carbonyl groups (34Sankaram M.B. Thompson T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8686-8690Google Scholar, 35Robinson A.J. Richards W.G. Thomas P.J. Hann M.M. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 164-170Google Scholar), and it markedly enhances the orientational order and the packing of lipid acyl chains in the liquid-crystalline state (36Delmelle M. Butler K.W. Smith I.C.P. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 698-704Google Scholar, 37Seelig J. Seelig A. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1980; 13: 19-61Google Scholar, 38Sankaram M.B. Thompson T.E. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10676-10684Google Scholar). In contrast, the effects and location of Chol in the emulsion surface layers remain uncertain. Reisinger and Atkinson (39Reisinger R.E. Atkinson D. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 849-858Google Scholar) have revealed that Chol broadens the thermal transition of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine in CO-dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine microemulsions, suggesting that Chol is located primarily in the microemulsion surface. As shown in Table I, Chol increased the order parameter and decreased the rotational motion of DPHpPC in emulsion surface layers as well as in bilayers (40Kinosita K.J. Kawato S. Ikegami A. Adv. Biophys. 1984; 17: 147-203Google Scholar, 41Saito H. Araiso T. Shirahama H. Koyama T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1991; 109: 559-565Google Scholar). We identified increases in the fluorescence anisotropy of TMA-DPH and DPHpPC in CO-PC emulsions with increasing surface Chol content (Fig. 3). In TG-PC emulsions, however, the increase in the anisotropy of TMA-DPH caused by Chol tended to be delayed (15Saito H. Nishiwaki K. Handa T. Ito S. Miyajima K. Langmuir. 1995; 11: 3742-3747Google Scholar), whereas the fluorescence anisotropy of DPHpPC changed in a manner similar to that seen in CO-PC emulsions, indicating that the ordering effect of Chol is significant in the inner hydrocarbon region, rather than in the outer region. One explanation for these findings is that Chol is located in a different manner on the surface layers of TG-PC and CO-PC emulsions. For TG-PC emulsions, we have proposed (15Saito H. Nishiwaki K. Handa T. Ito S. Miyajima K. Langmuir. 1995; 11: 3742-3747Google Scholar) that Chol can be accommodated in the surface membranes spanning the surface-core interface with the hydroxyl group in the opposite direction, presumably by hydrogen bond formation between the carbonyl groups of TG and the hydroxyl group of Chol. If so, the different effects of Chol on the molecular order of TMA-DPH and DPHpPC could be explained by an arrangement in which Chol is associated with surface phospholipids but located deep in the inner hydrocarbon region. Since only one carbonyl group is present in CO compared with three for TG, CO is thought to be less effective in terms of hydrogen bonding with Chol. Thus, replacing core TG with CO would cause the core-adjacent surface Chol to be squeezed toward the outer parts of the surface layers. The marked differences in the anisotropy of TMA-DPH between TG-PC and CO-PC emulsions shown in Fig. 3 are likely to result from this redistribution of Chol in the surface layers rather than the direct interaction of surface and core lipids. The quenching studies using dehydroergosterol indicated that some surface-associated Chol is inaccessible to the aqueous phase in TG-PC emulsions, whereas all of it is accessible in CO-PC emulsions. This suggested that surface Chol in TG-PC emulsions is located in a deep hydrocarbon region of surface layers, consistent with the notion of the Chol location discussed above. However, the fraction of surface Chol with a hydroxyl group facing the aqueous phase is not known from the quenching results because the location of Chol could vary continuously with the depth in the hydrocarbon region. Direct information using nuclear magnetic resonance is required to determine the precise location of Chol in the emulsion surface monolayers. The data in Table III indicate that the core mobility modulated by replacing TG with CO is a major determinant for apoE binding to the emulsions. apoE is a 299-residue protein that contains the 22-kDa receptor-binding and carboxyl-terminal lipid-binding domains. The lipid-binding domain contains two types of amphipathic helices, class A and G*, which are responsible for lipid binding affinity (42Segrest J.P. Jones M.K. De Loof H. Brouillette C.G. Venkatachalapathi Y.V. Anantharamaiah G.M. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 141-166Google Scholar). The 22-kDa domain contains a four-helix bundle arrangement. This bundle is thought to undergo a conformational change when associated with lipid, such that it opens up with a broad hydrophobic face (about 3000 Å2) that can interact with lipid (4Weisgraber K.H. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 249-302Google Scholar). Thus, the binding of apoE to the lipid surface will create large packing defects in the hydrophobic interior of the surface layers. If so, the core TG could fill the packing defects by deeply penetrating toward the surface to allow apoE to bind to the emulsion surface. The penetrating ability of CO for filling the packing defects would be weaker than that of TG due to the ordered structure of CO. The large difference between the mobility of TG and CO, therefore, must result in the preferential binding of apoE to TG-PC, rather than to CO-PC emulsions. This interpretation may be closely related to the finding that 3–4-fold more pig apolipoprotein AI (261 residues) binds to TG-PC emulsions than to PC vesicles.2 This may be because the lack of core penetration in PC vesicles causes it to have a poor binding capacity for apolipoproteins. In contrast, replacing the core lipids had little effect on the binding of apoCII to the emulsions (Table III). apoCII is a 78-residue small protein with high affinity for the lipid surface through a well defined class A helical domain (42Segrest J.P. Jones M.K. De Loof H. Brouillette C.G. Venkatachalapathi Y.V. Anantharamaiah G.M. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 141-166Google Scholar). Based on the snorkel model proposed by Segrest et al. (43Segrest J.P. De Loof H. Dohlman J.G. Brouillette C.G. Anantharamaiah G.M. Proteins. 1990; 8: 103-117Google Scholar), the class A helices of apoCII are thought to insert into surface layers such that the amphipathic helices are buried within the hydrophobic interior of phospholipid monolayers. The binding of apoCII to the lipid surface will not, therefore, need as much penetration of core lipids to fill the packing defects in the hydrophobic interior of surface monolayers as apoE, resulting in the high binding affinity of apoCII to CO-PC emulsions. Previously, we have demonstrated that PC has large lateral attractive interactions with apolipoprotein AI, whereas very low interactions between Chol and apolipoprotein AI occurred at the triolein-saline interface (44Handa T. Saito H. Tanaka I. Kakee A. Tanaka K. Miyajima K. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1415-1420Google Scholar). In this study, Chol reduced the binding affinity of apolipoproteins, but the binding behavior of apoCII and apoE responded differently to Chol enrichment. Chol increases the lipid molecular order and thereby reduces the conformational flexibility of lipid acyl chains. This motional restriction of PC by Chol may be unfavorable for the lipid binding of class A amphipathic helix with the “snorkeling” structure, presumably because of the inhibition of the helix insertion into the hydrophobic interior of surface layers. In this respect, the presence of Chol in the emulsion surface will significantly decrease the binding affinity of class A helices in apoCII. The weak effect of Chol on the binding affinity of apoE may be due to the higher content of the class G* helix than the class A helix in apoE (42Segrest J.P. Jones M.K. De Loof H. Brouillette C.G. Venkatachalapathi Y.V. Anantharamaiah G.M. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 141-166Google Scholar). For the complete dissociation of apoE from the emulsion surface, not only Chol enrichment but also replacing core TG with CO is needed. During the metabolism of the plasma TG-rich lipoproteins, chylomicrons, and very low density lipoproteins, the lipoprotein particles become smaller and vary in lipid composition: specifically, their CO content in the core. Particle size is an important factor in regulating the distribution of exchangeable apolipoproteins (24Tajima S. Yokoyama S. Yamamoto A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10073-10082Google Scholar, 45Granot E. Schwiegelshohn B. Tabas I. Gorecki M. Vogel T. Carpentier Y.A. Deckelbaum R.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15190-15197Google Scholar). In this study, we partially elucidated the mechanism in which the increase in core CO exerts metabolic effects on the lipoprotein particles. We showed that replacing core TG with CO causes the redistribution of Chol in the surface layers of the emulsions and thereby modulates the surface properties. Furthermore, the reduced mobility of core lipids arising from replacing TG with CO appears to decrease the penetration of core lipids for filling packing defects in the surface layers. As a result, exchangeable apolipoproteins such as apoCII and apoE will dissociate from the Chol-enriched, CO-core emulsions that represent the lipid composition of LDL. In TG-rich lipoproteins, the hydrolysis of core TG produces Chol-enriched remnant particles (3Small D.M. Kreisberg R.A. Segrest J.P. Plasma Lipoproteins and Coronary Artery Disease. Blackwell Scientific Publications Ltd., London1992: 57Google Scholar). During this process, the bound apolipoprotein Cs begin to leave the remnant particles, while apoE remains bound to the remnant surface, thus mediating the uptake of the particles. This binding behavior of exchangeable apolipoproteins during the metabolic process is consistent with the present findings that apoCII dissociated from the Chol-enriched emulsion particles, whereas apoE remained bound. Our results suggested that the binding sensitivity of apolipoproteins for the lipid composition of lipoproteins, such as Chol enrichment, plays an important role in lipoprotein metabolism."

The mutational spectra of the two DNA polymerases suggest that template slippage occurred with higher frequency in the presence of the more distributive DNA polymerase β. The molecular mechanisms of mutagenesis are not well understood. One general pathway is thought to involve error-prone replication past unrepaired DNA damage. Bulky DNA lesions can result from cellular exposure to agents such as UV light or a variety of chemical carcinogens. Studies performed in vivo indicate that mammalian cells possess the ability to circumvent blocks to DNA synthesis and are able to replicate in the presence of these lesions (1Kadyk L.C. Hartwell L.H.

In vitro, it has been demonstrated that a number of purified cellular DNA polymerases can replicate through bulky adducts. For example, calf thymus DNA polymerase δ has been shown to replicate past cis-syn- and trans-syn-cyclobutane-thymine dimers in the presence of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (5O'Day C.L. Burgers P.M.J. Taylor J.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5403-5406Google Scholar). We have recently shown that an intrastrand cross-link formed by the anticancer and mutagenic agent cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (cisplatin) blocked calf thymus DNA polymerases α, δ, and ε, while DNA polymerase β is capable of replicating past the lesion (6Hoffmann J.S.

DNA polymerase β, the structurally simplest of the five known mammalian DNA polymerases, is believed to function primarily in the repair of damaged DNA. It is a monomeric protein of 335 amino acids (39 kDa) that lacks exonuclease activities and works in a distributive manner, although it is capable of processive gap-filling synthesis on single-stranded DNA templates for up to 6 nucleotides (7Singhal R. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15906-15911Google Scholar). DNA polymerase β appears to be the least accurate of the eukaryotic DNA polymerases in replicating undamaged DNA in vitro (8Kunkel T.A. J. Biol.

Human immunodeficiency virus reverse transcriptase (HIV-1 RT) also catalyzes highly error-prone replication (10Perrino F.W. Preston B.D. Sandell L.L. Loeb L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Science. 1994; 264: 1930-1935Google Scholar). The mutagenic consequences of the replicative bypass of a single Pt-d(GpG) adduct in vitro are unknown. We compare here the fidelity of replicative bypass of this DNA lesion by HIV-1 RT and DNA polymerase β. Escherichia coli MC1061 (hsdR, mcrB, araD, 139Δ-(araABC-leu), 7679ΔlacX74, galU, galK, rpsL, thi), the transformation host, and an F′ derivative of strain CSH50 (Δ(pro-lac)thi, ara, strA/F′(proAB, la-cla-zΔM15)), used as an indicator for the transfected E. coli MC1061, were provided by Dr. Lawrence Loeb (Seattle, WA). Calf thymus DNA polymerase β was purified as described previously (16Chang L.M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 3789-3795Google Scholar) and was a generous gift of Drs. Vladimir Podust and Ulrich Hübscher (Zürich, Switzerland); 1 unit of DNA polymerase β corresponds to 1 nmol of dNTP incorporated into acid-insoluble materials at 37°C in 60 min. HIV-1 RT was purified according to Preston et al. (17Preston B.D. Poiesz B.J. Loeb L.A. Science. 1988; 242: 1168-1171Google Scholar) and was generously provided to us by Dr. Lawrence Loeb. One unit of HIV-1 RT is the amount of enzyme required to incorporate 1.0 nmol of [3H]TTP into an acid-insoluble product in 10 min at 37°C using poly(dA)/oligo(dT) as a template. EcoRI was from New England Biolabs. BamHI and DNA ligase were from Eurogentec. Deoxynucleoside triphosphates and dideoxynucleoside triphosphates were from Pharmacia. Taq DNA polymerase was purchased from Promega. [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) was from NEM Corp. The 60-mer and the 60-mer platinum-containing oligonucleotides were constructed and purified as described (6Hoffmann J.S. Pillaire M.J. Maga G. Podust V. Hübscher U. Villani G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5356-5360Google Scholar). These templates contain the sequence of the protooncogene HRAS from codon 7 to codon 14 (nucleotides 2–25). For primer extension assays, these templates were hybridized to 5′-32P-labeled 17-mer (positions 44–60) and 39-mer (positions 22–60) synthetic primers. All oligonucleotides used were synthesized with the Cyclone Plus DNA synthesizer from MilliGen/Bioresearch and purified on 20% polyacrylamide gel. For calf thymus DNA polymerase β, the reactions (15 µl) contained 25 mM Hepes (pH 8.5), 125 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, and 500 µM each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP. In assays with HIV-1 RT, the reaction mixtures contained, in a final volume of 15 µl: 60 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.2), 7 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM EDTA, 10 mM KCl, 100 µM of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP. At the end of the reactions, 5 µl of stopping buffer (90% formamide, 0.1% xylene cyanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 0.1 mM EDTA) was added. The products were then analyzed on 15% acrylamide, 7 M urea, 30% formamide gel. The 17-mer synthetic primer 5′-d(TACAACCAAGAGCATAC)-3′ was labeled at its 5′ terminus using [γ-32P]ATP and annealed to the 60-mer and the 60-mer platinum-containing templates. Labeled primed-templates (100 ng) were extended in vitro by 50 units of calf thymus DNA polymerase β or 40 units of HIV-1 RT at 37°C for 120 min in 10 independent samples of 15 µl for each enzyme. DNA synthesis was terminated by the addition of stopping buffer, and the replicated DNA was heat-denatured and resolved by electrophoresis through a 15% polyacrylamide, 7 M urea, 30% formamide gel. The bypass products were then excised from the gel, and the DNA extracted overnight at room temperature in presence of 300 mM NaCl and centrifuged through a Sephadex G-50 minicolumn to remove salts and unincorporated [γ32P]ATP. Approximately 0.1 ng of the purified bypass product (bypass 1 and 2, Fig. 4A; and bypass product, Fig. 4B) were mixed with 30 pmol each of PCR primers; a 27-mer primer (5′-GAATTCACAACCAAGAGCATACGACGG-3′), which complemented positions 39–59 of the 60-mer and bore an EcoRI restriction site, and a 22-mer primer (5′-GCGGGATCCGGTGGTGGTGGGC-3′), which corresponded to nucleotides 1–13 of the 60-mer and bore a BamHI restriction site. Amplification was obtained in a final volume of 50 µl containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, and 1 unit of Ampli-Taq DNA polymerase. The reaction mixtures were heated to 95°C for 1.5 min, followed by 30 cycles of DNA reannealing (60°C; 1 min), elongation (72°C; 1.5 min), and denaturation (95°C; 30 s). The PCR products were visualized on a 2% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide and purified by extraction with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alchohol, followed by precipitation with ethanol. The PCR products were then digested with EcoRI and BamHI, ligated into the polylinker region of M13mp10 using 1 unit of DNA ligase, and incubated overnight at 16°C. E. coli MC1061 were electroporated in the presence of 4 µl of ligation reaction at 2 kV, 25 microfarads, and 200 ohms using a Gene-Pulser electroporator (Bio-Rad). The transformed cells were plated with E. coli CSH50 cells. Colorless plaques were picked, single-stranded DNA was prepared, and the inserted DNA segments were sequenced (18Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Google Scholar). After replication, the products were resolved by electrophoresis through a 15% polyacrylamide, 7 M urea, 30% formamide gel. The autoradiograms were then scanned using a Whole Band Analyzer version 3.2.2, and the bands were quantified with the Bioimage® application (Roissy-France). We annealed the 60-mer and the 60-mer platinum-containing templates with a 5′-phosphorylated 17-mer oligonucleotide primer (Fig. 1A) and investigated primer extension by different amounts of enzyme and at different incubation times. The newly synthesized DNA products were resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. Fig. 1B shows the replication of 10 ng of intact and treated oligonucleotides by increasing amounts of enzyme. Full-size (60-mer) products were observed after replication of unplatinated template by all HIV-1 RT concentrations tested, although about half of the available primers were not processed by the enzyme at the highest enzyme concentration. An intermediate product, located at a GGG run (nucleotides 10–12 of the template sequence; indicated by an asterisk in Fig. 1B, left lanes) was also observed, indicating the presence of a replicative pause during polymerization. Two classes of reaction products were observed after replication of the cisplatin-damaged template (Fig. 1B, right lanes). The products migrating as 39-, 40-, and 41-mers correspond to arrest of replication either at the base preceding the lesion or at the bases opposite the platinated guanines. The other products are roughly located at the position of the full-size template. The amount of bypass products increased with the concentration of HIV-1 RT, reaching 53% of the elongated products in presence of 1 unit of enzyme (Fig. 1C). A kinetic study, performed with 1 unit of HIV-1 RT for incubation times ranging from 5 to 60 min gave comparable results (data not shown). The pause site observed following synthesis on undamaged template (asterisk in Fig. 1B, left) was less intense when replication occurred on the platinated 60-mer (see also Fig. 2), suggesting that HIV-1 RT dissociated less frequently at the (GGG) run when replicating the platinated template. These results showed that purified HIV-1 RT can efficiently bypass the Pt-d(GpG) adduct during in vitro replication of the 60-mer substrate, thus resembling calf thymus DNA polymerase β (6Hoffmann J.S.

Pillaire M.J. Maga G. Podust V. Hübscher U. Villani G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5356-5360Google Scholar). To assess the importance of this mechanism for HIV-1 RT, we analyzed its capacity to extend a 39-mer primer, whose 3′ dA terminus was positioned opposite the dT base prior to the lesion (Fig. 2A). Fig. 2B (left lanes) shows that primer extension on the intact template by HIV-1 RT generated a full-length 60-mer product and the intermediate product previously detected (see Fig. 1). The enzyme efficiently initiated DNA synthesis from the nucleotides opposite the Pt-d(GpG) adduct (Fig. 2B, right lanes). Bypass products represented more than 60% of the extended oligonucleotides after 1 h at 37°C (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that the mechanism enabling in vitro bypass of the Pt-d(GpG) adduct by HIV-RT is similar to the one proposed for DNA polymerase β. Primer utilization on both platinated and unplatinated templates was greater then for the 17-mer (Fig. 1), perhaps reflecting greater stability of the initiation complex with the annealed 39-mer. As was observed for the 17-mer primed 60-mer platinated template, the intensity of the pause site located at the GGG run was greatly reduced upon replication of the 39-mer primed 60-mer platinated template compared to the intact template (Fig. 3). Hence, the presence of the adduct diminished the pausing of HIV-1 RT, which might suggest a more processive mode of DNA synthesis when replicating the damaged substrate. In order to investigate the fidelity of DNA replication past the Pt-(GpG) adduct catalyzed by DNA polymerase β and HIV-1 RT, we examined the sequences of the high molecular weight bypass products generated by the enzymes. These were resolved by electrophoresis on a polyacrylamide gel, excised, purified, and amplified (see Fig. 4, A and B, and “Materials and Methods” for details). Translesion replication products represented 55% of the extended products with HIV-1 RT, and 72% with DNA polymerase β. As a control, products generated on the undamaged template were also purified in the same way. As can be seen in Fig. 4A, DNA polymerase β generated a second, minor higher molecular weight product after bypassing the cisplatin lesion. This product, designed bypass 2, represented 8% of the elongated products and migrated as a 72-mer according to a M13 sequence reaction products that were loaded on the same gel (not shown). We were able to PCR-amplify the bypass 2 product by using the same PCR primers used to amplify the bypass 1 (see “Materials and Methods”). We found that the single-stranded bypass products migrated at the same position on denaturing gels as the platinated single-stranded templates (data not shown). Consequently, the non-radioactive platinated templates were purified together with the radioactive synthesized bypass products. In order to assure exclusive amplification of the bypass products by PCR, we verified that the Taq DNA polymerase was unable to amplify the damaged templates in the course of the PCR reaction. To do this, the 60-mer undamaged and damaged templates were annealed to 5′-32P-labeled 17-mer primer and replicated by the Taq DNA polymerase at 72°C for 1.5 min to mimic the first cycle of the amplification reaction. The products of replication by the Taq were then resolved by electrophoresis on a polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography. The enzyme, which can efficiently elongate the untreated control template, stopped opposite the thymine base immediately preceding the lesion (data not shown). Hence, an abortive product was obtained, which could not be amplified during the subsequent cycles. This result indicated that the cisplatin-damaged templates present among the population of the bypass products cannot be processed by the Taq DNA polymerase and therefore cannot be PCR-amplified. The PCR-amplified bypass products were cloned into the polylinker region of M13mp10 replicative form DNA so that they created an out-of-frame insert in the lacZ gene. The recombinant DNA was electroporated into MC1061 E. coli cells, and colorless plaques were randomly picked. Single-stranded DNA was prepared, and nucleotide sequences of the bypass products were determined by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method (18Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Google Scholar). No mutations were observed among the 25 clones sequenced from full-size products generated by the DNA polymerase β on the intact template. This demonstrates that the mutations detected on platinated template were caused by DNA polymerase β replication errors during translesion synthesis past the Pt-(GpG) adduct and that no mutagenic events occurred at high frequency during PCR amplification. Sequencing of 36 recombinant molecules containing bypass 1 products generated in vitro by DNA polymerase β yielded a total mutation frequency of 42%. Table I shows the location, type, number, and relative frequency of mutations obtained. The most frequent modifications were −1 deletions of the cytosine situated immediately in 5′ of the two adjacent guanines involved in the cisplatin lesion.Table ISpectrum of mutations induced by the single cisplatin intrastrand cross-link during replication of the 60-mer substrate by calf thymus DNA polymerase β Some of these −1 frameshift modifications were accompanied by one or two additional mutations at the sequence CGCC (template nucleotides 13–16), essentially deletions of cytosines (Table I). The presence of these double and triple mutants suggested that modifications at the first hot spot 5′ of the adduct might have promoted mutations at the CGCC sequence. We found three mutants deleted in the cytosine at position 13 of the template, which is the 3′-terminus of the left PCR primer (Table I). These mutations are likely not the result of a PCR artifact, since such mutations were not observed among the clones sequenced as controls. The fact that all these three mutants were also deleted at the guanine at position 14 allowed the hybridization of the left PCR primer to nucleotide 15 of the bypass product (dG) and the subsequent amplification. The sequence of bypass 2 is presented in Fig. 5. A single insertion of the sequence 5′-TGGTGGTGGGCG-3′ between the base dG (site 14) and the base dC (site 15) was observed (see arrow in Table I). This inserted sequence corresponds to nucleotides 3–14 of the original DNA template. As in the case of DNA polymerase β, no mutations were detected after sequencing 25 clones derived from replication of the intact templates by HIV-1 RT. Sequencing of 42 recombinant molecules containing bypass products generated in vitro by HIV-1 RT yielded a mutation frequency of 26%, less than the frequency observed with DNA polymerase β. In addition, the observed mutation spectrum was different (Table II); most of the modifications were single mutations, and 90% of these (9/10) were at the site of the lesion. Among these modifications, 54% (6/11) were one-base deletions opposite one of the two guanines involved in the adduct, while 27% (3/11) were insertion of T opposite G at position 20. These data demonstrate that the mutagenic consequences of the bypass catalyzed by HIV-1 RT are different from whose obtained with calf thymus DNA polymerase β.Table IISpectrum of mutations induced by the single cisplatin intrastrand cross-link during replication of the 60-mer substrate by human immunodeficiency virus type I reverse transcriptase cis-Diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (cisplatin) is an anticancer agent that is frequently used in the treatment of testicular and ovarian cancers (19Loehrer P.J. Einhorn L.H. Ann. Intern. Med. 1984; 100: 704-713Google Scholar). DNA damage is responsible for the cytotoxic and mutagenic effects of cisplatin, and it has been shown that the Pt-d(GpG) adduct is the most common lesion formed on DNA by this agent (20Sherman S.E. Lippard S.J. Chem. Rev. 1987; 87: 1153-1181Google Scholar). This lesion is refractory to repair by crude cell extracts (21Calsou P. Frit P. Salles B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 6363-6368Google Scholar, 22Szymkowski D.E. Yarema K. Essigmann J.M. Lippard S.J. Wood R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10772-10776Google Scholar), mainly due to protection of the lesion from repair enzymes by high mobility group-domain proteins (23Huang J.C. Zamble D.B. Reardon J.T. Lippard S.J. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10394-10398Google Scholar). Cisplatin induces mutations in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Thus patients treated with this drug may risk developing secondary tumors (24Greene M.H. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1992; 84: 306-312Google Scholar). A possible mechanism of cisplatin-induced mutagenesis is an error-prone replication past the Pt-d(GpG) adduct. We have recently observed efficient translesion synthesis of this adduct by calf thymus DNA polymerase β (6Hoffmann J.S. Pillaire M.J. Maga G. Podust V. Hübscher U. Villani G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5356-5360Google Scholar), the least accurate of the eukaryotic DNA polymerases (9Kunkel T.A. Alexander P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 160-166Google Scholar, 25Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12866-12874Google Scholar). We show here that, like pol β, HIV-1 RT is able to bypass the same defined Pt-d(GpG) adduct (Fig. 1). A bulky adduct such as Pt-d(GpG) might be expected to strongly reduce DNA polymerase binding, as suggested by the capacity of Pt-d(GpG) to terminate DNA synthesis by numerous DNA polymerases (6Hoffmann J.S. Pillaire M.J. Maga G. Podust V. Hübscher U. Villani G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5356-5360Google Scholar, 26Hoffmann J.S. Johnson N.P. Villani G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15130-15135Google Scholar, 27Comess K.M. Burstyn J.N. Essigmann J.M. Lippard S.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3975-3990Google Scholar, 28Belguise-Valladier P. Maki H. Sekiguchi M.

Structural studies of these enzymes suggest that contacts between the protein and template-primers might be severely perturbed by the presence of DNA damage. In contrast, the Pt-d(GpG) adduct did not inhibit replication by HIV-1 RT (Fig. 1) and pol β (6Hoffmann J.S. Pillaire M.J. Maga G. Podust V. Hübscher U. Villani G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5356-5360Google Scholar). Both were capable of initiating replication at 3′ terminus across from the lesion, suggesting that the mechanism enabling in vitro bypass may be similar for these enzymes (Fig. 2 and 6Hoffmann J.S. Pillaire M.J. Maga G. Podust V. Hübscher U. Villani G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5356-5360Google Scholar). Furthermore, replication across the Pt-d(GpG) adduct by HIV-1 RT and pol β was highly mutagenic (Table I, Table II). To our knowledge, this is the first time that the mutagenic power of the cisplatin has been demonstrated in vitro, and that this property is shown to be the result of translesion synthesis. We observed that 42% of the replication products of calf thymus DNA polymerase β contained mutations. We found that 26% of these mutations were single-base deletions of the cytosine in 5′ of the lesion and that 60% of the mutagenic events were multiple mutations. Most of these modifications occurred at two hot spots, one situated at the nucleotide dC in 5′ to the cisplatin bifunctional lesion (template nucleotide 19), and the other located at the sequence CGCC (template nucleotides 13–16) (Table I). It is of interest to compare the mutation spectrum of this adduct in vitro with results in mammalian cells where polymerase β might be expected to be an important element in replicative bypass. A single-stranded DNA vector bearing the same cisplatin-modified HRAS sequence has been replicated in simian COS-7 cells with an observed mutation frequency of 21%. However, in contrast to results with purified DNA polymerase β, the most frequent modifications in vivo were base substitutions and 92% of the mutagenic events occurred at one or both of the platinated guanines (3Pillaire M.J. Margot A. Villani G. Sarasin A. Defais M. Gentil A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2519-2524Google Scholar). A direct comparison of these data is difficult, since DNA repair after translesion replication (mismatch repair or loop repair) may substantially alter in vivo results. Furthermore, the discrepancy between the in vivo and the in vitro mutagenesis spectra might be explained by the different stability and topology of the DNA templates used (60-mer oligonucleotide versus single-stranded DNA). Finally, it is entirely possible that bypass replication of the platinated HRAS sequence in vivo requires the action of DNA polymerases other than DNA polymerase β, or the involvement of yet unidentified accessory proteins. Different frequencies and positions of mutations were obtained with HIV-1 RT (Table II); 26% mutagenesis was observed (compared to 42% with pol β), and mutations were primarily one-base deletions targeted at a hot spot opposite the lesion. DNA polymerase β, the least processive enzyme, shows a higher propensity for frameshifts in an in vitro M13mp2 mutagenesis assay compared to other DNA polymerases (25Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12866-12874Google Scholar). HIV-1 RT also shows a strong tendency to generate frameshifts within runs of three or more of the same nucleotide on M13mp2 DNA (11Bebenek K. Abbotts J. Roberts J.D. Wilson S.H. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16948-16956Google Scholar). Hence, the capacity of both enzymes to produce one-base frameshift deletions at or near the Pt-d(GpG) adduct was not unexpected. Frameshift mutations from transient misalignment of the primer-template junction at a DNA lesion have been reported previously (30Ripley L.S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1990; 24: 189-213Google Scholar, 31Kunkel T.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8003-8011Google Scholar, 32Lambert I.B. Napolitano R.L. Fuchs R.P.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1310-1314Google Scholar, 33Wang C.I. Taylor J.S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3671-3681Google Scholar). A similar mechanism of dislocation, induced by the rigid conformational constraint of the Pt-d(GpG) adduct (34Herman F. Kozelka J. Stoven V. Guittet E. Girault J.P. Huynh-Dinh T. Igolen J. Lallemand J.Y. Chottard J.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 194: 119-133Google Scholar), could explain the one-base deletions at the damage after HIV-1 RT replication (Fig. 6A). In the case of DNA polymerase β, however, two correct nucleotides dC have been incorporated opposite the platinated guanines (Table I). This result and our previous data (6Hoffmann J.S. Pillaire M.J. Maga G. Podust V. Hübscher U. Villani G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5356-5360Google Scholar) suggest that translesion synthesis is more efficient by pol β than by HIV-1 RT. With this enzyme, template slippage appears to occur 5′ of the lesion (Fig. 6B). The unexpected second mutation hot spot observed with calf thymus DNA polymerase β deserves comment (Table I). This site was located at the sequence CGCC, 4–7 nucleotides 5′ to the cisplatin adduct. Two types of mutations were detected. First, two-base frameshift deletions appeared at the CGCC hot spot concomitantly with a mutation across from the lesion. Although modification of the replication complex at the lesion may somehow favor a strand slippage at the second hot spot, the reasons for this apparent “two hit” mutagenesis and for the relative positions of the two hot spots are unclear. Second, a 12-nucleotide repeat (nucleotides 3–14 of the template) was observed between dG and dC of the CGCC hot spot with a frequency of 8% of the elongated products (bypass 2, Fig. 4). Further studies with other DNA lesions and template sequences will be necessary to determine whether these unusual mutagenic events represent a general phenomenon. If so, damage-induced tandem replication by DNA polymerase β could be an important mechanism for genetic instability. DNA polymerase β has a distributive mode of DNA synthesis (35Wang T.S.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 513-552Google Scholar) and likely dissociates and reassociates frequently with the substrate. These dissociation events could increase the opportunities for template flexibility and slippage induced by the presence of a bulky adduct. In contrast, higher processivity could explain why HIV-1 RT produced fewer frameshift mutations compared to DNA polymerase β. A correlation between the probability of dissociation from the template of HIV-1 RT and its capacity to generate frameshift has been proposed (36Bebenek K. Abbotts J. Wilson S.H. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10324-10334Google Scholar, 37Bebenek K. Beard W.A. Casas-Finet J.R. Kim H.R. Darden T.A. Wilson S.H. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19516-19523Google Scholar). In spite of a common polymerase folding motif (15Sawaya M.R. Pelletier H. Kumar A. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Science. 1994; 264: 1930-1935Google Scholar), the co-crystal structure of HIV-1 RT showed that the enzyme can bind to a DNA template-primer in an orientation opposite to that of DNA polymerase β (38Kohlstaedt L.A. Wang J. Friedman J.M. Rice P.A. Steitz T.A. Science. 1992; 256: 1783-1790Google Scholar, 39Jacobo-Molina A. Ding J. Nanni R.G. Clark A.D. Lu X. Tantillo C. Williams R.L. Kamer G. Ferris A.L. Clark P. Hizi A. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6320-6324Google Scholar). This anti-pol β mode of DNA synthesis has been shown to confer processivity to the enzyme (40Huber H.E. McCoy J.M. Seehra J.S. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4669-4678Google Scholar, 41Reardon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8743-8751Google Scholar). Increased processivity of HIV-1 RT is suggested by the observation that this polymerase paused less at the GGG sequence during replication of cisplatin-damaged DNA than while replicating undamaged template (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). Therefore, distributive mode of DNA synthesis could be an important mechanism for DNA damage-induced instability. We are deeply grateful to Dr. Neil Johnson for comments on the manuscript."

As reported previously for bromotetramisole, levamisole activated wild-type CFTR channels stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells in the absence of other secretagogues and without elevating intracellular cAMP or calcium. The protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor N - (2-(p-bromocinnamylamino)ethyl)-5-isoquinolinesul-fonamide abolished activation by forskolin but only partially inhibited stimulation by levamisole, suggesting the involvement of other kinases. CFTR channels bearing mutations at multiple phosphorylation sites, in the membrane domains, and in the first nucleotide binding domain (including the disease-causing mutations G551D and ΔF508) all responded to phenylimidazothiazoles. Moreover, levamisole and bromotetramisole increased the activity of wild-type and mutant channels already exposed to PKA + MgATP, consistent with the inhibition of a constitutive, membrane-associated phosphatase activity. We conclude that phenylimidazothiazole drugs can open normal and mutated CFTR channels by stabilization of phosphoforms of CFTR that are produced by basal activity of PKA and alternative protein kinases.

Phosphatase inhibitors have been suggested as potential therapies for cystic fibrosis (18Becq F. Jensen T.J. Chang X.-B. Savoia A. Rommens J.M. Tsui L.-C. Buchwald M. Riordan J.R. Hanrahan J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9160-9164Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar); however, the phosphatase that regulates CFTR in airway epithelia and CHO cells remains to be identified. It does not appear to be PP1, PP2A, or PP2B (8Tabcharani J.A. Chang X.-B. Riordan J.R. Hanrahan J.W. Nature. 1991; 352: 628-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 18Becq F. Jensen T.J.

The role of PP2C, which was defined based on its magnesium dependence, has been difficult to establish definitively because there are no specific inhibitors of this enzyme. PP2C, alkaline phosphatase (23Fernley H.N. Walker P.G. Biochem. J. 1967; 104: 1011-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and the CFTR channel itself (22Dousmanis A.G. Nairn A.C.

We recently obtained evidence that CFTR is associated with a membrane-bound phosphatase activity that controls spontaneous deactivation (rundown) of channel activity in excised patches (8Tabcharani J.A.

Several phosphodiesterase and/or alkaline phosphatase inhibitors were found to slow rundown and inhibit CFTR protein dephosphorylation in isolated membranes.

CHO-K1 cells that had been stably transfected with pNUT vector alone (denoted CFTR(−)) or with wild-type CFTR (CFTR(+)) or various mutated versions (G551D, R347D, R117H, and ΔF508) in pNUT were used (8Tabcharani J.A. Chang X.-B. Riordan J.R. Hanrahan J.W. Nature. 1991; 352: 628-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 15Chang X.-B. Tabcharani J.A. Hou Y.-X. Jensen T.J. Kartner N. Alon N. Hanrahan J.W.

Cells were cultured in α-minimum essential medium containing 7% fetal bovine serum, 0.5% penicillin-streptomycin (all from Life Technologies, Inc.), and 100–200 µM methotrexate (obtained from Horner) and maintained at 37°C in 5% CO2. CHO cells were plated at low density on glass coverslips and cultured at 37°C in 5% CO2 for 1–4 days before use. The methods used for patch-clamp recordings are similar to those previously described (8Tabcharani J.A. Chang X.-B. Riordan J.R. Hanrahan J.W. Nature. 1991; 352: 628-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 18Becq F. Jensen T.J. Chang X.-B. Savoia A. Rommens J.M. Tsui L.-C. Buchwald M. Riordan J.R. Hanrahan J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9160-9164Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Single-channel currents were recorded from both cell-attached and excised patches. Data were continuously recorded using an Axopatch 200A amplifier (Axon Instruments, Inc., Foster City, CA) and video tape recorder. Recordings were low pass filtered at 150 Hz (8-pole Bessel) and digitized at 1 kHz for analysis by a laboratory computer and custom software. Current amplitudes were determined using a semi-automated procedure in which unitary currents were measured at each potential from amplitude histograms computed for short segments of record, and values were displayed as current-voltage (I/V) relationships at the end of the run. Reversal potentials and conductances data were obtained from the I/V curves by least square regression analysis. Voltage was referenced to the external surface of the membrane patch. In all illustrations, outward currents (flowing into the patch electrode) are displayed in the upward direction. The pipette solution contained (in mM); 150 NaCl, 2 MgCl2, and 10 TES (pH 7.4); the bath contained (in mM); 145 NaCl, 4 KCl, 2 MgCl2, and 10 TES (pH 7.4). Cells were stimulated with 15 µM forskolin (from 15 mM stock in dimethyl sulfoxide; final Me2SO concentration, 0.1%). Channels were activated in excised patches by exposure to 1 mM MgATP and 180 nM PKA catalytic subunit. Open probability (Po) was calculated for 10-s intervals during recordings that lasted ∼600 s. Experiments were performed at room temperature (20–22°C). CFTR(−) or CFTR(+) CHO cells were loaded for 1 h at room temperature with the following buffer (in mM): 136 NaI, 3 KNO3, 2 Ca(NO3)2, 11 glucose, and 20 HEPES, pH 7.4. Extracellular NaI was removed by thoroughly washing with efflux buffer (136 mM NaNO3 replacing the same amount of NaI). Cells were equilibrated for 1 min in a final 1-ml aliquot. The first four aliquots were used to establish a stable baseline efflux, and then agonist was added (at time 0) and the amount of iodide in each aliquot was determined using an iodide-specific electrode. Alternatively, a radioisotopic method for measuring iodide was used to measure iodide efflux and gave equivalent results. After removing the culture medium, CFTR(−) or CFTR(+) CHO cells were washed twice with 2 ml of modified Earle's salt solution (solution B) containing (in mM): 137 NaCl, 5.36 KCl, 0.4 Na2HPO4, 0.8 MgCl2, 1.8 CaCl2, 5.5 glucose, and 20 HEPES, pH 7.4. Cells were loaded in solution B containing 1 µM KI (0.1 µCi of 125I-Na/ml, Amersham Corp.) for 30 min. The first two aliquots were used to establish a stable baseline efflux, and then the buffer was replaced with fresh solution containing agonist for subsequent aliquots. The medium was recovered at the end of the incubation, cells were solubilized in 1 N NaOH, and radioactivity was determined using a γ counter (Compu Gamma, LKB). Efflux curves were constructed by plotting the percent of cellular content accumulated in the medium versus time. Cells were grown to confluence, washed twice with Ca2+- and Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline and detached from plates with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% EDTA. They were spun down at 800 rpm for 10 min at 4°C and resuspended in KRH buffer (140 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 1.2 mM MgSO4, 1.2 mM KH2PO4, 6 mM glucose, 25 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4). Samples were taken for cyclic AMP determination by using a cyclic AMP enzyme immunoassay kit (Sigma). Cells were loaded with fura 2 acetoxymethyl ester (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) as described previously (24Harris R.A. Hanrahan J.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 265: C781-C791Crossref Google Scholar). Briefly, individual coverslips were mounted in the bottom of a temperature-controlled, laminar flow-through chamber mounted on a Nikon inverted microscope equipped for epifluorescence (Diaphot, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Excitation light was from a 75 W mercury-xenon arc lamp. The emitted fluorescence was deflected to the eyepieces or to an intensified charge-coupled device video camera (Model 2468, Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu City, Japan). Analyses were performed using a computer-based image analysis system (Fluor-1; Universal Imaging, West Chester, PA) and are presented as ratios of the fluorescence intensities at 520 nm measured during excitation at 340 or 380 nm. The catalytic subunit of PKA was obtained from the laboratory of M. P. Walsh and was described previously (8Tabcharani J.A. Chang X.-B. Riordan J.R. Hanrahan J.W. Nature. 1991; 352: 628-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). The protein kinase inhibitor N-(2-(p-bromocinnamylamino)ethyl)-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide (H89) and protein phosphatase inhibitors calyculin A and okadaic acid were from RBI (Natick, MA). Levamisole and bromotetramisole were purchased from Aldrich (Metuchen, NJ), forskolin was from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA), and other chemicals were from Sigma. The data are presented as the means ± S.E. Statistical significance was assessed at the 95% confidence level using the Student's t test. We showed previously that bromotetramisole can activate single CFTR channels on cultured cells; however, it was not clear if such stimulation would generate a significant macroscopic flux. Thus we compared 125I effluxes from CFTR(−) and CFTR(+) CHO cells during stimulation by bromotetramisole or forskolin. Fig. 1A shows that 125I efflux from CFTR-expressing CHO cells was stimulated by 5 µM forskolin, consistent with previous studies of these and other CFTR-expressing cells (9Berger H.A. Anderson M.P. Gregory R.J. Thompson S. Howard P.W. Maurer R.R. Mulligan R. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1422-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Bromotetramisole (2 mM) evoked a similar iodide efflux from CFTR(+) but not from CFTR(−) cells (Fig. 1B). Importantly, bromotetramisole (2 mM) stimulated 125I efflux from CFTR(+) CHO cells in the absence of forskolin (Fig. 1, B and D), and the response was comparable with the one evoked by forskolin. Many cells have calcium-activated chloride conductances that could potentially mediate 125I effluxes. Therefore, we examined the effect of raising intracellular Ca2+ using a calcium ionophore. The ionophore A23187 (10 µM) failed to modulate iodide effluxes from CFTR(−) or CFTR(+) CHO cells, suggesting that elevating calcium is not sufficient to activate this anion permeability (compare Figs. 1, C and D). Single channel activity was studied in cell-attached patches from CFTR(+) and CFTR(−) CHO cells with or without phenylimidazothiazole drugs in the bath (Fig. 2). Spontaneous openings of CFTR channels did not occur on resting CFTR(+)cells (n = 15) but were consistently observed following addition of 600 µM levamisole to the bath (Fig. 2, A and B). The maximum number of channels activated by levamisole (N) averaged 6.5 ± 1.04 (n = 6 patches), as estimated from the largest number of simultaneous openings during long recordings. Channel open probability (Po) averaged 0.35 ± 0.01 (n = 6) during stimulation by levamisole alone. The current-voltage relationship of levamisole-stimulated CFTR channels and the magnitude and time course of the levamisole-induced iodide efflux were similar to those obtained during forskolin stimulation (Fig. 2, C and D) and are consistent with previous reports using CHO cells (8Tabcharani J.A.

Cell. 1992; 68: 809-818Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). On CFTR(+) CHO cells, CFTR channel activity was observed in 86% of experiments with 1 mM levamisole (20 out of 23 patches; Fig. 2E) and in 66% of experiments in the presence of 1 mM bromotetramisole (14 out of 21 patches; data not shown). Importantly, forskolin and other cAMP agonists were not present during these studies of levamisole and bromotetramisole effects. Both drugs failed to activate channels on CFTR(−) CHO cells (Fig. 2E). Stimulation of CFTR channels by levamisole was concentration-dependent (Fig. 3). Open probability was 0.03 ± 0.01 with 60 µM levamisole (n = 3); however, this may be overestimated because the number of channels tends to be underestimated when Po is low because all the channels in the patch rarely open simultaneously. By contrast, the number of active CFTR channels in cell-attached patches was 14 ± 1 (n = 4), and mean Po was 0.45 ± 0.2 (n = 4) during exposure to 5 mM levamisole. The concentration of levamisole required to elicit 50% of the maximal response (EC50) was 450 µM. Maximal stimulation of the Po was obtained with millimolar levels of levamisole (Fig. 3, B and C). This potency is considerably lower than reported previously for inhibition of alkaline phosphatase by levamisole (11 µM) and bromotetramisole (1.2 µM; 25Metaye T. Millet C. Kraimps J.L. Saunier B. Barbier J. Begon F. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 1507-1511Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), indicating low membrane permeability or the phosphatase regulating CFTR may be distinct from known alkaline phosphatases despite having an epitope recognized by an antibody to alkaline phosphatase (7Becq F. Fanjul M. Merten M.D. Figarella C. Hollande E. Gola M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 327: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Two lines of evidence suggest that activation by phenylimidazothiasole drugs was relatively specific for CFTR. First, we did not observe activation of any other ion channels by levamisole or bromotetramisole in the 38 cell-attached patches or many more that were recorded in the inside-out configuration. Second, bath addition of the dextro isomer D-bromotetramisole (1 mM, n = 8), which does not inhibit alkaline phosphatase and is often used as a control for nonspecific actions (26Van Belle H. De Broe M.E. Wieme R.J. Clin. Chem. 1977; 23: 454-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), had no effect on CFTR channels in the cell-attached configuration. The protein phosphatase 1 and 2A inhibitors calyculin A (10 µM, n = 5) and okadaic acid (10 µM, n = 10) also failed to activate CFTR channels in cell-attached patches, as expected from their inability to slow rundown of channel activity in excised patches (18Becq F. Jensen T.J. Chang X.-B. Savoia A. Rommens J.M. Tsui L.-C. Buchwald M. Riordan J.R. Hanrahan J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9160-9164Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). We examined the effects of phenylimidazothiazoles on signaling pathways by measuring intracellular cAMP and free Ca2+ concentrations in CHO cells during maximal stimulation by levamisole. cAMP levels increased from 6.4 ± 0.1 pmol/well in resting CHO cells (n = 3, Fig. 4A) to 66.6 ± 10 pmol/well during exposure to 15 µM forskolin (n = 3, Fig. 5A). By contrast, incubation with levamisole (1 mM) or bromotetramisole (1 mM) had no effect on cAMP levels (8.6 ± 0.5 pmol/well (n = 3, Fig. 5A) and 5.3 ± 0.8 pmol/well (n = 3), respectively). Thus phenylimidazothiazoles do not increase anion permeability by raising intracellular cAMP. To examine the possibility that calcium mobilization mediates chloride channel activation by these drugs, we determined cytosolic free Ca2+ concentrations before and during exposure to levamisole or the calcium ionophore ionomycin using digital fluorescence imaging. CHO cells were superfused with 1 or 5 mM levamisole for 8 min, allowed to recover for 10 min, and then exposed to 100 µM ionomycin for another 8 min. As shown in Fig. 5B, levamisole had no effect on the fluorescence ratio, whereas ionomycin caused a more than 3-fold increase. Similar results were obtained using levamisole (1 mM, data not shown). These data showing that phenylimidazothiazole drugs do not affect the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration are consistent with those in Fig. 2 (C and D), which demonstrated that the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 does not stimulate iodide efflux.Fig. 5Functional response of 8SE-CFTR stably expressed in CHO cells.

Nairn A.C. Gadsby D.C. Ped. Pulmonol. 1995; 20: 418-426Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Levamisole (1 mM) still activated CFTR channels in the presence of high concentrations of H89 (50 µM) in five out of eight experiments (mean number of channels; n = 1.6 ± 1.3). H89 effectively inhibited the PKA-dependent pathway under these conditions because forskolin stimulation was completely blocked (n = 5). Nevertheless, the number of active CFTR channels per patch was decreased by 75% compared with control conditions (i.e., levamisole without H89). Partial activation by levamisole in the presence of H89 suggests that other kinases in addition to PKA contribute to CFTR activation during exposure to phosphatase inhibitors. Rich et al. (27Rich D.P. Berger H.A. Cheng S.H. Travis S.M. Saxena M. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20259-20267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that a mutant CFTR containing eight serine-to-aspartate substitutions generated channels that could open without PKA-dependent phosphorylation. We studied a similar mutant in which the eight R domain serines had been replaced with glutamates (8SE). 8SE channel activity was occasionally observed on unstimulated cells (Fig. 5, A and B), although open probability and number of active channels per patch were similar with (Po = 0.11 ± 0.1, n = 8; n = 1.1 ± 0.8, n = 8 patches) or without exposure to 15 µM forskolin (Po = 0.12 ± 0.15, n = 7; n = 1.4 ± 0.9, n = 7 patches). This ineffectiveness of forskolin contrasted with levamisole and bromotetramisole (1 mM), which increased the Po and the number of active 8SE-CFTR channels by 3.5-fold (Fig. 5, A and B). Fig. 5C shows a representative experiment in which 1 mM bromotetramisole was added to an unstimulated cell stably expressing 8SE-CFTR. The low level of constitutive activity before the addition of the drug was increased significan"
https://openalex.org/W2079316046,"A lutein-binding protein was purified from fifth instar larval midgut of Bombyx mori by a combination of ammonium sulfate fractionation and three chromatographic procedures, gel filtration, chromatofocusing, and anion exchange chromatography. The protein has a pI of 5.4 and an apparent molecular mass of 35,000 Da, as determined by a linear gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The lutein-protein complex is water-soluble and more stable than the carotenoid or protein alone. The carotenoid moiety was identified by thin layer chromatography, light absorption spectroscopy, and high performance liquid chromatography as all-trans-lutein. Lutein is specifically and stoichiometrically bound to the protein, with a ratio of 3 mol of lutein per mol of protein. Binding of lutein (absorption maximum in hexane at 454 nm) to the apoprotein results in a marked red spectral shift of about 38 nm, giving rise to absorption maxima at 432, 462, and 492 nm in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0. The lutein-protein complex is characterized by fine spectral structure indicating that lutein is in a relatively rigid environment. This protein is distributed in equal amounts throughout the midgut and in all developmental stages of the larval B. mori.

This protein is distributed in equal amounts throughout the midgut and in all developmental stages of the larval B. mori. Carotenoids cannot be synthesized by animals or insects and must be acquired from exogenous sources. In many insects, absorption of dietary carotenoids is selective with a preference for carotenes in Orthoptera and Phasmida, and for xanthophylls (oxygenated carotenes) in Lepidoptera, as in the case for the silkworm, Bombyx mori, the subject of this study (1Britton G. Armitt G.M. Lau S.Y.M. Patel A.K. Shone C.C. Britton G. Goodwin T.W. Carotenoid Chemistry and Biochemistry. Pergamon Press, Oxford1982: 237Google Scholar, 2Kayser H. Kerkut G.A. Gilbert L.I. Comprehensive Insect Physiology and Pharmacology. Pergamon Press Inc., New York1985: 367Google Scholar). Once absorbed, carotenoids are either irreversibly or reversibly modified. Irreversible modification includes (a) decomposition of the carbon skeleton into smaller units or (b) the addition of new functional groups, e.g. hydroxylation. Reversible modification includes (a) esterification of the hydroxy carotenoids with long chain fatty acids, as observed in fat body (3Harashia K. Ohno T. Sawachika T. Hidaka T. Ohnishi E. Insect Biochem. 1972; 2: 29-48Google Scholar, 4Kayser H. Insect Biochem. 1975; 5: 861-875Google Scholar), or (b) conjugation of the carotenoids with proteins forming carotenoid-protein complexes (carotenoproteins) which are water-soluble and more stable than the carotenoids alone (5Chino H.

Biochem. Physiol. 1981; 68: 89-93Google Scholar). Such carotenoproteins occur mainly in invertebrates and plants (8Zagalsky P.F. Pure Appl. Chem. 1976; 47: 103-120Google Scholar). In B. mori, a major fate of the absorbed carotenoids is incorporation into the cocoon, which imparts various colors to the cocoon depending on the type of carotenoid. The mechanisms by which carotenoids are transported from the lumen of the midgut to the hemolymph lipoprotein, lipophorin, and from lipophorin into the silk gland, where the cocoon is produced, are unknown. Cocoons of the wild-type B. mori are yellow in color due to presence of lutein. There are three known mutants in B. mori that produce white cocoons, and genetic analysis has revealed that two mutations are in midgut-expressed proteins, whereas the third mutation is in a silk gland-specific protein (9The Silkworm: An Important Laboratory Tool. National Institute of Genetics, Mishima, Japan1978: 53-81Google Scholar). Currently, we are using these mutants as a model system to examine, at the molecular level, the pathways by which dietary carotenoids are absorbed and transported to their final destination, and as part of this study a specific luetin-binding protein has been isolated and partially characterized from the B. mori midgut. Benzamidine hydrochloride, aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin A, glutathione, dithiothreitol, butylated hydroxy toluene, and thin layer chromatography (TLC) plates (Whatman 60A) were purchased from Sigma; Spherogel TSK DEAE-5PW was purchased from Beckman; Sephacryl S-200, Sephadex G-75 superfine, polybuffer 74, and polybuffer exchanger PBE 94 were purchased from Pharmacia Biotech. YMC C-18 (250 × 4.6 mm) was purchased from Wilmington, NC. Silkworms of the polyvoltine race N4 (a gift from Dr. Y. Yamashita, Nagoya University) were reared at 25–27°C on an artificial diet prepared from mulberry leaves (Yakult Corp., Tokyo, Japan). Third- and fourth-day fifth instar larvae of both sexes were used as sources of the lutein-binding protein. The silkworms were anesthetized on ice for 30 min and then the midguts were dissected. The midgut contents were removed and the tissue washed three times with ice-cold buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, containing 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mM diisopropyl fluorophosphate, and 0.5 mM benzamidine). The midguts were either frozen at −70°C or immediately used for preparation of solubilized cytosolic proteins. Using a Polytron homogenizer, midguts were homogenized in buffer A, followed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C, and the supernatant was then subjected to an ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C in a Ti 60 rotor. To remove lipophorin (d <1.12 g/ml), which itself contains carotenoids and is bound to the surface of the midgut, the midgut supernatant was adjusted to a density of 1.31 g/ml with solid KBr and subjected to density gradient ultracentrifugation at 50,000 rpm for 16 h at 4°C (10Shapiro J.P. Law J.H. Wells M.A. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 1984; 23: 297-318Google Scholar), and the gradient was fractionated from the top of the tube into 1-ml fractions using a fraction collector. Lipophorin-free fractions, with a density ≥1.2 g/ml, were pooled and dialyzed overnight at 4°C against buffer A. All subsequent purification steps were carried out at 4°C with minimum illumination. Sufficient solid ammonium sulfate was added slowly, with continuous stirring, to the lipophorin-free supernatant to achieve 25% saturation. The suspension was maintained in an ice water bath for 30 min, followed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g at 4°C for 30 min, and the pellet was discarded. Using the same procedure, solid ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant to obtain, sequentially, 10% increments of ammonium sulfate fractionation. The precipitated proteins obtained between 25–35, 35–45, 45–55, 55–65, 65–75, 75–85, and 85–100% ammonium sulfate saturation were resuspended in a minimum amount of buffer B (20 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.0, containing 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM benzamidine, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 0.25 mg/liter pepstatin A, 0.25 mg/liter aprotinin, and 0.1 mg/liter leupeptin). Protein and carotenoid concentrations were determined for each fraction. Proteins precipitated in the range of 45–55% ammonium sulfate saturation were used to purify the lutein-binding protein. This sample was loaded onto a Sephacryl S-200 column (2 × 78 cm) packed following the manufacturer's instructions and pre-equilibrated with buffer A. The column was eluted with the same buffer at a flow rate of 0.23 ml/min, and 3-ml fractions were collected and monitored at 280 and 460 nm for protein and carotenoids, respectively. Fractions containing the lutein-binding protein were pooled and concentrated by precipitation with solid ammonium sulfate (85%, w/v). The precipitate was resuspended in a minimum amount of buffer B and loaded onto a Sephadex G-75 superfine column (2.5 × 65 cm) pre-equilibrated with buffer A. The column was eluted with buffer A at a rate of 0.3 ml/min; 2.5-ml fractions were collected and monitored for protein and for carotenoids. Fractions containing the lutein-binding protein were concentrated by ultrafiltration using an Amicon model 52 with a YM10 ultrafiltration membrane and then diluted with 25 mM histidine-HCl buffer, pH 6.3, and reconcentrated. The concentrated sample was loaded on a PBE 94 chromatofocusing column (0.5 × 18 cm) pre-equilibrated with 25 mM histidine-HCl buffer, pH 6.3, and prewashed with 5 ml of polybuffer PBE 74, pH 5. The column was developed with polybuffer PBE 74, and 1-ml fractions were collected. The pH of each fraction was measured, and all fractions were monitored at 280 and 460 nm. In order to remove the polybuffer PBE 74, solid ammonium sulfate (85%, w/v) was added to the lutein-binding protein fractions, and after 1 h on a shaker at 4°C, the precipitate was collected by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge tube at 15,000 × g for 30 min in the cold room. The yellow precipitate was washed 3 times with ice-cold 85% ammonium sulfate buffer and then frozen at −70°C for further analysis. The peak obtained from the chromatofocusing column was dialyzed overnight at 4°C against 10 mM BisTris 1The abbreviations used are: BisTris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)-propane-1,3-diolHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. -HCl buffer, pH 7.0, and loaded on a HPLC Spherogel TSK DEAE column (7.5 mm × 7.5 cm) pre-equilibrated with the same buffer, and fractions were eluted using a 100 mM NaCl linear gradient in the same buffer and 0.5-ml fractions collected. All fractions were monitored for 280 and 460 nm. 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)-propane-1,3-diol high performance liquid chromatography polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Purification was monitored spectrophotometrically using a Diode array spectrophotometer. Fold purification achieved was determined as the ratio of the carotenoid absorbance at 460 nm to protein absorbance at 280 nm. Carotenoid-containing samples were incubated with an equal volume of ice-cold ethanol for 10 min, followed by two extractions with equal volumes of hexane. The samples were briefly centrifuged to facilitate phase separation, and the organic extracts were pooled and evaporated under argon gas. Carotenoids were analyzed using isocratic HPLC in which 25 µl were injected onto a YMC C18 column (250 × 4.6 mm; S-5 mm; 120A) equilibrated with 90% methanol, 10% tetrahydofuran containing 0.25 g/liter butylated hydroxy toluene. Eluted components were identified using either a Milton Roy dual wavelength detector or a Hewlett Packard photodiode array detector. Using the dual detector, the chromatograms were monitored at 452 and 280 nm, and with the photodiode array the spectrum was scanned from 200 to 550 nm. Carotenoid standards were run under the same conditions. Lutein concentrations were determined from standard curves. Extracted carotenoids, carotenoid standards, and standards of triglycerides, diglycerides, monoglycerides, free fatty acids, and cholesterol were also applied to TLC plates and developed with hexane/acetone (19:1, v/v). Antibodies were raised by intramuscular injection of the protein-adjuvant mixture (Ribi Immunochem Research, Hamilton, MT) into a New Zealand White male rabbit. The antibody was stored at 4°C in the presence of 0.02% azide. Tissue specificity of the lutein-binding protein was determined on the following samples from hormonal sac and eggs from day 2 adults and from day 3 fifth instar larvae: whole midgut, midgut divided into three parts (anterior, middle, and posterior), hemolymph, fat body, testis, ovaries, and silk gland. For each sample, 20 µg of protein was separated on a 4–15% linear gradient SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted using goat anti-rabbit IgG and an alkaline phosphatase color development system (Bio-Rad). To determine the developmental appearance of the lutein-binding protein in the midgut, 40 µg of midgut homogenates from larvae on day 3 of the first through the fifth instar were separated on 4–15% linear gradient SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA method following the manufacturer's procedure with bovine serum albumin as a standard (11Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). Apparent molecular weights were determined using either a gradient (4–15%) or linear (12%) SDS-PAGE prepared as described by Laemmli (12Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) in the presence of low and high molecular weight markers obtained from Sigma. All gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Protein bands on some gels were photometrically scanned using a Beckman Gel Scanner which determined the purity as well as the amount of the protein present. In order to test for glycosylation, 15 µg of the partially purified protein (obtained from the chromatofocusing step) were run on two 12% SDS-PAGE. The protein on one gel was transferred to nitrocellulose and incubated in a solution containing 100 µg of fluorescein-labeled concanavalin A in 50 ml of 20 mM HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, containing 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MnCl2, and 1 mM CaCl2 for 1 h at room temperature, rinsed in the same buffer, and observed under UV illumination (Calbiochem). The second gel was incubated in 25% 2-propanol, 10% acetic acid for 6 h at room temperature, followed by another incubation in the same solution containing 0.2% thymol for 90 min. Then the gel was immersed in 80% sulfuric acid, 20% ethanol until the gel clarified and glycoproteins appeared as pink-red bands (13Racusen P. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 99: 474Google Scholar). In the larvae of B. mori, the only tissues that contain significant amounts of carotenoids are the midgut, the hemolymph, and the silk glands. During larval development, the fat body does not contain any detectable carotenoids until late in the fifth instar and the spinning stage, when carotenoids are relocated to the fat body, which becomes yellowish in color. Midgut carotenoids account for 32.2 and 35.5% of the total carotenoids present in the larvae on the 3rd and 4th days of fifth instar, respectively, whereas on the 1st and 2nd days the midgut carotenoids account for only 11.7 and 20.6%, respectively, of the total carotenoids. For this reason, only 3rd- and 4th-day fifth instar insects were used to isolate the carotenoid-binding protein. Lipophorin, the major hemolymph carrier of lipids in insects, is rich in carotenoids (14Kawai N. J. Insect Physiol. 1976; 22: 207-216Google Scholar, 15Fujii H. Morooka J. Tochihara S. Kawaguchi Y. Sakaguchi B. J. Seric. Sci. Jpn. 1988; 57: 94-99Google Scholar, 16Gilbert L.I. Chino H. J. Lipid Res. 1974; 15: 439-456Google Scholar). In B. mori, about 40% of the total carotenoids found in the larvae are present in lipophorin. In order to remove lipophorin which was absorbed to the midgut, the midgut cytosolic fraction was subjected to a density gradient ultracentrifugation. Ammonium sulfate fractionation of the lipophorin-free cytosolic homogenates demonstrated the presence of carotenoids in all fractions (Fig. 1). Light absorption spectra of the three ammonium sulfate fractions that contained the bulk of the carotenoids are depicted in the inset to Fig. 1. All fractions displayed a relatively high absorption spectra with discernible peaks in the visible region between 310 and 500 nm. The presence of these peaks suggests that the carotenoids are bound to proteins. For example, proteins precipitated between 35–45% and 75–85% exhibited distinguishable single peaks, characterized by some spectral fine structures at 410 and 368 nm and accounted for 11 and 5% carotenoids, respectively (Fig. 1, inset, A and C). The majority of the midgut carotenoids (60%) were present in the fraction precipitating between 45 and 55%. This fraction exhibited a light absorption spectrum with two discernible peaks at 458 and 480 nm and a ratio of carotenoid absorbance at 460 nm to protein absorbance at 280 nm of 0.0189 (Fig. 1, inset, B). Thus, this fraction was used as the source of lutein-binding protein. The elution patterns of the lutein-binding protein on gel filtration chromatography are depicted in Fig. 2. On Sephacryl S-200, two peaks with absorption spectra at 460 nm were observed (Fig. 2A). Fraction I, with an apparent molecular mass greater than 125 kDa, accounted for less than 25% of the total carotenoids and was not further characterized. The second peak (II) contained the bulk of the carotenoids (70%) and was characterized by absorption maxima at 430, 458, and 490 nm and a ratio of 0.043 for the absorbance at 460 to 280 nm. The pooled fractions from this peak were precipitated with 85% ammonium sulfate, reconstituted with buffer B, and applied to a G-75 superfine Sephadex column. The elution profile indicated the presence of one major carotenoid-containing peak with a ratio of 0.143 for the absorbance at 460 to 280 nm (Fig. 2B). When the material from the G-75 column was loaded onto a PBE 94 isoelectric focusing column, only one peak at 460 nm was obtained, with a ratio of 0.625 for the absorbance at 460 to 280 nm and a pI value of 5.4 (Fig. 3A). SDS-PAGE analysis of the protein obtained from chromatofocusing step revealed the presence of two bands of 35 and 31 kDa (Fig. 3B). Final purification of the lutein-protein was achieved using HPLC and a TSK-DEAE column (Fig. 4A). Only the high molecular weight protein (35 kDa) which was eluted at 40 mM NaCl contained carotenoids (Fig. 4B) and exhibited a ratio of 2.5 for the absorbance at 460 to 280 nm. This represents a 350-fold purification from the lipophorin-free supernatant (Table I).Table ISummary of the purification of the lutein-binding protein from B. mori larval midgutStepA460/A280Purification-foldLipophorin-free supernatant0.00711.045-55% ammonium sulfate fraction0.01892.6Sephacryl fraction0.0436.1Sephadex G-75 fraction0.14320.0Chromatofocusing fraction0.62587.5DEAE fraction2.5350.0 Open table in a new tab The absorption spectrum of the purified lutein-binding protein is characterized by three absorbance maxima in the visible region at 432, 460, and 492 nm (Fig. 5A), and the position of the three maxima was the same in all preparations and was independent of the ionic strength of the medium and pH within the range of 5 and 8. There is considerable variation in the absorption maxima for carotenoproteins, depending on the color of the carotenoprotein. The majority of invertebrate carotenoproteins exhibit absorption maxima between 560 and 680 nm, characteristic of blue or green coloration, but absorption maxima between 490 and 530 nm (red or purple) and 370 to 410 nm (yellow and blue) have also been reported (17Buchwald M. Jencks W.P. Biochemistry. 1968; 7: 844-859Google Scholar, 18Salares V.R. Young N.M. Carey P.R. Bernstein H.J. J. Raman Spectrosc. 1977; 6: 282-288Google Scholar, 19Salares V.R. Young N.M.

The carotenoids extracted from the purified protein were examined by thin layer chromatography and only one carotenoid was identified which cochromatographed with the lutein standard (no other lipids were detected, data not shown). The absorption spectrum of the extracted carotenoid was also identical to that of lutein standard (Fig. 5, B, inset). Isocratic HPLC analysis of the extracted carotenoid confirmed the presence of only all-trans-lutein, with a ratio of 3 mol of lutein per mol of protein (Fig. 5B). The absorbance maxima of the lutein-binding protein represent a significant red shift of 22–38 nm compared with the spectrum of lutein in hexane or acetone, respectively. This major distinctive spectral shift in the complex is attributed to the polarizing effect of the apoprotein on the conjugated double bonds of the polyene chains of the carotenoid, as observed for the crustacyanins by resonance Raman spectroscopy (19Salares V.R. Young N.M. Bernstein H.J. Carey P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 576: 176-191Google Scholar). The polarization effect could be involved in binding, as well as in the spectral shift. It is possible that the C-3 and C-3′ hydroxy groups of lutein are involved in holding the carotenoid in the binding cavity of the protein and that other charged groups in the protein interact with the polyene system and affect the electronic configuration, resulting in a lower energy complex with a higher spectral shift. In α-crustacyanin, Weesie et al. (22Weesie R.J. Askin D. Jansen F.J.H.M. de Groot H.J.M. Lugtenburg J. Britton G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 34-38Google Scholar) have shown that a charge redistribution mechanism is the only cause for the bathochromic shift observed for astaxanthin. Britton et al. (1Britton G. Armitt G.M. Lau S.Y.M. Patel A.K. Shone C.C. Britton G. Goodwin T.W. Carotenoid Chemistry and Biochemistry. Pergamon Press, Oxford1982: 237Google Scholar) have reported that the presence of an oxo group in the carotenoid is important for binding to the protein and for production of a spectral shift through enolization, Schiff base formation, or hydrogen bonding to the amino acids of the protein. Recombination of the apoproteins of the lobster, Homarus gammarus, crustacyanin and of the star fish, Asterias rubens, asteriarubin with different carotenoids indicated that C-4 oxo groups in both rings are essential for the production of the large bathochromic shift (1Britton G. Armitt G.M. Lau S.Y.M. Patel A.K. Shone C.C. Britton G. Goodwin T.W. Carotenoid Chemistry and Biochemistry. Pergamon Press, Oxford1982: 237Google Scholar). This is not the case with ovorubin, in which some of the largest shifts were seen with carotenoids containing only one oxo group, for example adonixanthin (119 nm) and 3-hydroxycheinenone (120 nm) and even zeaxanthin (24 nm) and crustaxanthin (33 nm) which have no oxo group at all. The magnitude of the spectral shift observed for the B. mori lutein-binding protein is similar to that observed in recombination studies of ovorubin using zeaxanthin and crustaxanthin, indicating that significant spectral shifts are obtained despite the absence of the 4-oxo groups. The absorption spectrum of the lutein-binding protein is not only characterized by a significant bathochromic shift, but by fine structure, indicating that the carotenoids are in a relatively rigid environment (Fig. 5A). This observation favors the distortion/freezing mechanism in which the binding of the carotenoid to the protein results in twisting of the polyene system of the carotenoid (17Buchwald M. Jencks W.P. Biochemistry. 1968; 7: 844-859Google Scholar). In previous recombination studies, it was observed that carotenoids with two 4-oxo-β-rings exhibited a considerable increase in spectral fine structure on binding to protein, but that in the case of carotenoids with only one C-4 oxo group the increase in fine structure was very small, and that the binding of carotenoids with two hydroxy groups and no oxo functions caused almost complete loss of vibronic structure (1Britton G. Armitt G.M. Lau S.Y.M. Patel A.K. Shone C.C. Britton G. Goodwin T.W. Carotenoid Chemistry and Biochemistry. Pergamon Press, Oxford1982: 237Google Scholar). In contrast, the B. mori lutein-binding protein exhibited fine spectral structure, even though it has two hydroxy groups and does not have any oxo groups. These spectral structural differences could be attributed to the nature of the binding of the lutein to the apoprotein. Fig. 6, Fig. 7 present data on the tissue specificity of the lutein-binding protein. Western analysis of the different tissue proteins indicated that the lutein-binding protein is present in the midgut, fat body, and testis tissues, and in ovary and silk gland tissues (data not shown). This protein is not found in the hemolymph, hormonal sac, or eggs (Fig. 6B). The lutein-binding protein was equally distributed throughout the length of the midgut (Fig. 7B), and the midgut of all larval instars have the lutein-binding protein in equal amounts (Fig. 8B), suggesting that this protein is involved in lutein uptake throughout the larval development stages.Fig. 7Distribution of the lutein-binding protein within the midgut of larval Bombyx mori. Twenty µg of midgut homogenate protein from the anterior (lane 1), middle (lane 2), and posterior (lane 3) portion of the midgut were separated on a 4–15% linear gradient SDS-PAGE gel.

Gel B was transferred to nitrocellulose and immunoblotted using rabbit anti-lutein-binding protein antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The acidic nature of the lutein-binding protein (pI = 5.4) is not unique to this protein, as several studies have reported carotenoid-protein complexes to be acidic in nature and rich in aspartic acid (8Zagalsky P.F. Pure Appl. Chem. 1976; 47: 103-120Google Scholar, 23Shone C.C. Britton G. Goodwin T.W. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1978; 62: 507-513Google Scholar). In invertebrates, carotenoid-protein complexes have pI values between 3.6 and 5 (23Shone C.C. Britton G. Goodwin T.W. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1978; 62: 507-513Google Scholar, 24Rivas J.D.L.

In plants, Bryant et al. (26Bryant J.D. McCord J.D. Knight Unlu L. Erdman Jr., J.W. J. Agric. Food Chem. 1992; 40: 545-549Google Scholar) reported the purification of carotenoproteins from carrot roots with pI values of 3.6 and 3.8. Most carotenoproteins identified to date are very large complexes with molecular masses ranging from 100 to 1000 kDa (8Zagalsky P.F. Pure Appl. Chem. 1976; 47: 103-120Google Scholar, 26Bryant J.D.

Physiol. 1989; 93: 339-353Google Scholar) and are made up of more than two subunits ranging in size between 6 and 43 kDa (2Kayser H. Kerkut G.A. Gilbert L.I. Comprehensive Insect Physiology and Pharmacology. Pergamon Press Inc., New York1985: 367Google Scholar). The molecular mass of 35 kDa for the midgut lutein-binding protein of B. mori is small in comparison to these large complexes and is similar in mass to the tocopherol-binding protein isolated from rat liver (28Yoshida H. Yusin M. Ren I. Kuhlenkamp T. Stolz A. Kaplowitz N. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 343-350Google Scholar). Both the lutein- and tocopherol-binding proteins are about twice as large as the superfamily of lipid-binding proteins which includes fatty acid- and retinol-binding proteins (29Banaszak L. Winter N. Xu Z. Bernlohr D.A. Cowan S. Jones A. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 89-151Google Scholar). The absence of carbohydrates in the lutein-binding protein was demonstrated by the failure to obtain a positive stain with thymol-sulfuric acid, as well as the absence of a fluorescent band in the presence of fluorescein-labeled concanavalin A. Our results are in agreement with the α-crustacyanin and related crustacyanin carapace carotenoproteins that lack glycosylation (25Garate A.M. Milicua J.C.G. Gomez R. Macarulla J.M. Britton G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 881: 446-455Google Scholar). Both sugar and lipids have been found more frequently in carotenoid-protein complexes from ovaries and eggs (8Zagalsky P.F. Pure Appl. Chem. 1976; 47: 103-120Google Scholar). Purification and characterization of this lutein-binding protein is the first step in characterizing the pathways by which dietary carotenoids are absorbed and transported in insects. To our knowledge this lutein-binding protein represents the first example of a carotenoid-binding protein which may be involved in the intracellular transport and/or absorption of carotenoids.

In the present article we demonstrate that POU transcription factors suppress transcription of the human involucrin (hINV) promoter. Cotransfection of pINV-2473, a construct containing 2473 base pairs of hINV upstream sequence linked to luciferase, with POU homeodomain transcription factors Oct1, Oct2, Brn4, SCIP, Skn1a or Skn1i, results in a strong suppression of basal promoter activity. The hINV upstream region includes a consensus POU transcription factor binding site, 5′-ATGCAAAT-3′, centered around nucleotide −1277. Although this site interacts with POU factors, assays of promoter activity for a series of progressive 5′ end truncations demonstrate that this site is not required for POU factor-dependent transcriptional suppression. Suppression is observed with the shortest truncation construct tested, pINV-41, suggesting that this inhibition may be mediated by effects on TATA box proteins. SCIP mutants that lack transactivation or DNA binding domains were shown to suppress transcription, suggesting that the DNA binding and transactivation domains are not required for suppression. Moreover, cotransfection of the pINV-2473 with pKSM13(+)OCT, which contains a single consensus OCT binding site, results in an increase in basal promoter activity, suggesting that endogenous POU factors suppress hINV promoter activity. In addition to inhibiting basal transcription, POU transcription factors also suppress phorbol ester-stimulated hINV promoter activity. These studies suggest that suppression of hINV promoter activity does not require the amino-terminal segment of the POU factor or direct POU factor interaction with DNA and suggest that the suppression may be via indirect interaction with other proteins in the vicinity of the TATA box.

Three different nitrogen mass isotopomers of urea were found, containing no, one, or two atoms of 15N. Four glutamine isotopomers were found, containing no 15N, one atom of 15N in either the amino or amide position, or two 15N atoms. A mathematical relationship was deduced that predicts that the relative proportions of the urea isotopomers depends not only on the relative enrichment of 15N in the two precursor pools of urea nitrogen (mitochondrial ammonia and cytoplasmic aspartate) but on their absolute enrichment. This relationship was validated in experiments in which the isotopic enrichment of the substrate, 15NH4Cl, was varied.

By further deletion mapping of the pepsinogen C promoter, a minimal region (AGAACTattTGTTCC) was identified as being responsible for glucocorticoid-, androgen-, and progesterone-regulated gene expression."

Human procathepsin D was expressed in a baculovirus system to obtain correctly folded, glycosylated enzyme that upon acidification completely converts to the active intermediate, pseudocathepsin D. The oligosaccharide moieties of this recombinant enzyme contributed to about 5% of the apparent molecular mass of the enzyme, and the carbohydrate composition was quite similar to the native material. However, specificity constants (kcat/Km) of this glycosylated pseudoform for several synthetic chromogenic substrates were considerably less (33%-50%) than those for the native enzyme and were virtually identical with those observed with nonglycosylated pseudocathepsin D.A cleavable junction suitable for self-processing at the normal maturation point of human cathepsin D was engineered into procathepsin D according to known specificity requirements of this enzyme, and the construct was expressed using baculovirus. Following experiments that demonstrated that the new proenzyme failed to process to the expected point, the new cleavage junction was moved 6 residues toward the amino terminus of procathepsin D and expressed in Escherichia coli. After refolding, the protein containing the newly engineered junction self-processed, generating a shortened mutant form of pseudocathepsin D that is 6 residues longer at the amino terminus than the native material.

To sustain steady-state Cl− absorption by a mechanism of exchange for intracellular oxalate requires the presence of one or more pathways for recycling oxalate from lumen to cell. Accordingly, we evaluated the mechanisms of oxalate transport in luminal membrane vesicles isolated from the rabbit renal cortex. We found that transport of oxalate by Na+ cotransport is negligible compared to the transport of sulfate. In contrast, we demonstrated that oxalate shares the electroneutral pathway mediating Na+-independent sulfate-carbonate exchange. We also demonstrated the presence of OH−-oxalate exchange (indistinguishable from H+-oxalate cotransport). The process of OH−-oxalate exchange was electrogenic and partially inhibited by Cl−, indicating that it occurs, at least in part, as a mode of the Cl−-oxalate exchanger described previously. An additional component of OH−-oxalate exchange was insensitive to inhibition by either Cl− or sulfate, suggesting that it takes place by neither the Cl−-oxalate exchanger nor the sulfate-carbonate exchanger. We conclude that multiple anion exchange mechanisms exist by which oxalate can recycle from lumen to cell to sustain Cl− absorption occurring via apical membrane Cl−-oxalate exchange in the renal proximal tubule.

Both mRNAs begin at a common site 1338 bp upstream of the initiation codon, contain 3477 and 4411 nucleotides, respectively, and are encoded by two exons; exon 1 contains 0.5 kb of the 5′-noncoding region (NCR), while exon 2 encodes the remaining 0.8 kb of the 5′-NCR, the entire coding region (2 kb), and all of the 3′-NCR.

Although the proteins generated from either transcript are identical, the two mRNAs are functionally different, the 3.5-kb transcript producing ∼4-5-fold larger currents when expressed in Xenopus oocytes compared to the 4.5-kb mRNA.

Here we report the characterization of the entire transcriptional unit of mouse Kv1.4 (mKv1.4) which may represent the first such analysis for any member of the extended voltage-gated ion channel gene family. A multiple-tissue mouse mRNA blot obtained from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA) was probed with different regions of the 11-kb mKv1.4 genomic clone (stringency = 0.5 × SSC, 0.1% SDS and 60°C, exposure = 3–7 days). Blots were stripped of probe by boiling in 0.1% SDS and cooling to room temperature, and reused after ensuring that no residual probe remained. Three luciferase-containing constructs were used in this study. The control vector contains the SV40 enhancer and promoter elements upstream of the luciferase gene. The enhancer vector contains (from 5′ to 3′) the SV40 enhancer, a multiple cloning site for introducing the putative promoter-containing element, and the luciferase reporter gene. The basic vector includes only the luciferase gene with an upstream multiple cloning site for introducing the putative promoter fragment. Several 5′-flanking fragments from the mKv1.4 genomic clone were cloned into the enhancer or basic vectors using appropriate restriction enzymes, and their ability to induce luciferase activity was determined. The integrity of all constructs was confirmed by restriction mapping and/or by sequencing. C2C12 myoblast cells were grown in minimum essential medium (Cell Grow Mediatech, Washington, D. C.) containing 4.5 g/liter glucose, 10% fetal bovine serum (Summit Biotechnology, Greeley, CO), 0.1 IU/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin (ICN Biomedicals Inc., Costa Mesa, CA). NIH-3T3 mouse fibroblasts were maintained under almost similar conditions, except for a lowered glucose concentration (1 g/liter) in the minimum essential medium. One day prior to transfection, 5 × 105 cells/dish were plated into 100-mm Petri dishes, and fresh medium was added 1 h prior to transfection. Cells in each plate were transfected with 20 µg of DNA (isolated using the Qiagen Maxi-prep, Qiagen Inc., Chatsworth, CA) for 16 h by the calcium phosphate method and placed into fresh medium. Seventy-two hours post-transfection, the cells were washed with 1 × phosphate-buffered saline, harvested, and lysed for 20 min in 200 µl of Promega lysis reagent (Promega, Madison, WI), the cell lysates were pelleted, and the supernatants were frozen until assayed using the Luciferase Assay Kit (Promega) in a Monolight 2010 Luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, San Diego, CA). The Kv1.4 coding region was cloned into the pTM-1 vector (3Wymore R.S. Korenberg J.R. Kinoshita K.D. Aiyar J. Coyne C. Chen X.-N. Hustad C.M. Copeland N.G. Gutman G.A. Jenkins N.A. Chandy K.G. Genomics. 1994; 20: 191-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The Kv1.3/Kv1.4 chimeric construct was created as follows: the 3′-NCR BglII/EcoRI fragment of mKv1.4 (containing five ATTTA motifs) was inserted downstream of the coding region of the reporter molecule, Kv1.3, containing an antibody-recognizable epitope (gene 10) at its N terminus. This construct was linearized at either a SalI site (upstream of the ATTTAs) or an EcoRI site (downstream of all five ATTTAs), and cRNA was prepared. In a second chimeric construct, an oligonucleotide (Chemgenes, Needham, MA) corresponding to nt 395–447 of the 3′-NCR of mKv1.4 (ATTTAs 1–3) was linked to the 3′-end of Kv1.3. In a third construct, an oligonucleotide containing AGTGAs in place of the three ATTTA motifs (bp 395–447 of the 3′-NCR) was attached to the 3′ end of Kv1.3. The latter two constructs were linearized at the EcoRI site (downstream of the three ATTTAs or three AGTGAs), and cRNA was prepared. The cRNAs from all these constructs are identical in their Kv1.3-derived sequences (5′-NCR, coding region, and proximal 0.2 kb of the 3′-NCR), and differ only in the lengths of the Kv1.4-derived 3′-NCRs which they contain. cRNA from each construct was injected into Xenopus oocytes and evaluated as described (3Wymore R.S. Korenberg J.R. Kinoshita K.D. Aiyar J. Coyne C. Chen X.-N. Hustad C.M. Copeland N.G. Gutman G.A. Jenkins N.A. Chandy K.G. Genomics. 1994; 20: 191-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 11Soreq H. Seidman S. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 207: 225-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). cRNA for each of these constructs was synthesized and radiolabeled with [32P]CTP. Unincorporated nucleotides were removed by centrifugation through a Sephadex C-50 chromatography column (Boehringer Mannheim) followed by ethanol precipitation, and the cRNA concentration was adjusted to 1 mg/ml. Forty-six ng of cRNA were injected into each oocyte, and total RNA was extracted from 7 oocytes for each data point, either at time 0 (immediately after injection) or after 48 h. Oocytes were lysed in 1.2 ml of cell lysis solution (Promega), RNA-extracted, and run on a 1.5% agarose gel, autoradiographed to quantitate the levels of extracted RNA (X-omat film, Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY), scanned using a Hewlitt-Packard Scanjet IIcx with a transparency adaptor, and analyzed on a Macintosh computer using the public domain NIH Image program. 2The NIH Image program was written by Wayne Rasband, U. S. National Institutes of Health, and is available over the Internet by anonymous ftp from zippy.nimh.nih.gov. For each experiment, cRNA was injected into six oocytes; 48 h later, the oocytes were washed in fresh, ice-cold oocyte Ringer solution (96 mM NaCl, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 5 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 290–320 mosM), and completely lysed in ice-cold buffer (7.5 mM Na2HPO4, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (1 mg/ml leupeptin, 20 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mg/ml pepstatin A (Sigma). Oocyte yolk was removed by centrifugation (400 × g, 5 min at 4°C), the membranes were pelleted (12,000 × g, 30 min, 4°C), washed once in lysis buffer, and resuspended in Laemmli loading buffer (12Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 259: 680-685Crossref Scopus (204216) Google Scholar). The membrane-associated proteins were electrophoresed in a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (12Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 259: 680-685Crossref Scopus (204216) Google Scholar), electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp.) in Towbin buffer (192 mM glycine, 25 mM Tris base in 20% methanol), and blocked with 5% powdered milk. Western blot analysis was then performed using the mouse anti-gene 10 antibody (T-7 Tag, Novagen, Madison, WI; 1:4000 dilution) and the horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat-anti-mouse second antibody (Caltag, San Francisco, CA, 1:2000 dilution) as immunoprobes; the bands were visualized by the Enhanced Chemiluminescent System (Amersham) and exposed to Hyperfilm (Amersham, Buckinghamshire, UK) for 1–5 min. Autoradiographs were scanned and analyzed as described. Total RNA was extracted from mouse brain using Promega's total RNA isolation kit (Promega). This RNA (10 µg) was hybridized to an antisense cRNA probe derived from the mKv1.4 genomic clone. The 1.4-kb SacI/BamHI fragment was linearized at MspI (580 bp), and a [32P]dCTP (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) radiolabeled antisense cRNA probe was generated using T7 RNA polymerase. The total RNA and probe were hybridized overnight at 47°C in hybridization buffer (4 M NaCl, 400 mM PIPES, 10 mM EDTA, and 80% formamide). The reaction was digested with RNase A and T1 (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature. The digestion reaction was stopped with 10% SDS, followed by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The precipitated pellet was resuspended in 5 µl of water and 4 µl of loading buffer, heated at 85°C, and then loaded onto a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The gel was dried and autoradiography was performed overnight (−70°C, intensifying screen). In the negative control, yeast tRNA was substituted for the mouse brain RNA. A separate lane contained the full-length undigested probe. A synthetic oligonucleotide, 5′-GACAGCAGCGATCACTTG-3′, representing the sequence 53–70 nt downstream of the PstI site in the genomic region thought to be near the 5′-end of mKv1.4 (3Wymore R.S. Korenberg J.R. Kinoshita K.D. Aiyar J. Coyne C. Chen X.-N. Hustad C.M. Copeland N.G. Gutman G.A. Jenkins N.A. Chandy K.G. Genomics. 1994; 20: 191-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), was annealed to 3 mg of total mouse brain RNA at 55°C for 3 min and placed on ice. To this was added [32P]dCTP (25 mCi in 1 ml, 3000 Ci/mmol) and a mixture consisting of unlabeled deoxynucleotides (1 mM each dATP, dGTP, dTTP, Perkin-Elmer Corp., Norwalk, CT), reverse transcriptase (20 units, Promega), and RNase inhibitor (20 units, Boehringer Mannheim) in a final reaction volume of 50 µl, and the mixture was incubated for 10 min at 24°C, followed by 1 h at 40°C. The product was concentrated, mixed with acrylamide gel loading dye, and loaded onto a 6% acrylamide sequencing gel (6 ml/lane) adjacent to a sequencing reaction of the genomic clone primed with the identical oligonucleotide (20Kruys V.I. Marinx O. Shaw G. Deschamps J. Huez G. Science. 1989; 245: 852-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) (Sequenase, U. S. Biochemical Corp.). These were then electrophoresed and autoradiographed. A Northern blot probed with a mKv1.4-specific 3′-NCR fragment revealed hybridizing ∼3.5- and ∼4.5-kb bands in mouse brain and heart poly(A)+ mRNA, a weakly hybridizing ∼2.5-kb band in skeletal muscle, and additional faint signals in both lung and muscle; the probe did not hybridize detectably to mRNA from spleen, liver, kidney, or testes (Fig. 1). These results are consistent with previous reports describing the tissue distribution of the rat and human Kv1.4 homologues (4Stuhmer W. Ruppersberg J.P. Schroter K.H. Sakman B. Stocker M. Giese K.P. Perschke A. Baumann A. Pongs O. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3235-3244Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar, 5Tamkun M.M. Knoth K.M. Walbridge J.A. Kroemer H. Roden D.M. Glover D.M.

Tanouye M.A. FEBS Lett. 1990; 268: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). DNA fragments derived from six regions of the genomic clone (Fig. 2A) were used to probe poly(A)+ mRNA from mouse brain (Fig. 2B). The 4.5-kb band was found to hybridize with probes 1–5, while the 3.5-kb band was only detected by probes 1–3. Probe 6 hybridized to neither transcript, although it did hybridize to the Kv1.4 genomic clone used as a positive control (not shown); reprobing this lane with probe 4 revealed the expected 4.5-kb hybridizing band, indicating that the lack of hybridization to probe 6 was not due to the absence of mRNA in this lane. These hybridization patterns show that both of the mouse Kv1.4 transcripts share the 5′ exon, the entire coding region, and at least 0.2 kb of the 3′-NCR (probe 3), while the 4.5-kb mRNA contains an additional ∼900 nt in the 3′-NCR, the region spanned by probes 4 and 5. Examination of the 3′-NCR sequence reveals a consensus poly(A)+ signal (AATAAA) 177 bp downstream from the stop codon (Figs. 2A and 3). The 3.5-kb transcript must terminate at or near this poly(A)+ signal, since it does not hybridize with probe 4 (Fig. 2B) which begins 40 bp farther downstream (Figs. 2A and 3). The 4.5-kb transcript terminates at or close to a second poly(A)+ signal located 934 bp 3′ of the first, since it shows no hybridization with probe 6 which begins 40 bp downstream of this signal (Figs. 2A and 3). The significance of the A/T-rich motifs in the 3′-NCR (Fig. 3B) is discussed below. To delineate more precisely the 5′ end of the transcript, we used a 580-bp MspI/BamHI probe (Fig. 4A) in RNase protection assays. Mouse brain RNA (lane 3, Fig. 4B) protected a radiolabeled ∼280-bp fragment from RNase digestion, while the probe did not survive RNase treatment when incubated with control yeast tRNA (lane 2); the full-length undigested 580-bp probe is visible in lane 1. The size of the protected fragment suggests that the transcript initiation site is likely to be at or very close to the PstI site indicated by the asterisk in Fig. 2A. In primer extension experiments (Fig. 4C), a single band was visible. This band aligns with an adenosine in the nearest sequencing lane, which is 3 bp downstream from the PstI site (CTGCAGCCA) and 1337 bp upstream of the methionine initiation codon; we therefore designated this nucleotide nt +1 of mKv1.4 (Fig. 5). Thus, the two mKv1.4 mRNAs (4.5 and 3.5 kb) begin at the same site and appear to be identical except for the presence of an additional longer 3′-NCR sequence in the 4.5-kb transcript. The proteins generated by either mRNA are identical since they use the same coding region. The “3.5-kb” transcript contains 3476 nt (excluding any poly(A)+ tail) comprised of 1337 nt of 5′-NCR, 1962 nt of protein-coding region, and 170 nt of 3′-NCR. The “4.5-kb” transcript contains an additional 948 nt of 3′-NCR, yielding a total length of 4415 nt. The 2.5-kb transcript which is faintly visible in skeletal muscle (Fig. 1) remains to be characterized. If it includes the entire 1962-bp coding region, it must contain no more than ∼0.5 kb of total NCR. Assuming it uses the first polyadenylation site (yielding 170 nt of 3′-NCR), it would include only ∼370 nt of 5′-NCR. Do the two mKv1.4 mRNAs differ functionally? To address this question, we made a mKv1.4 expression construct containing the entire coding region which was linearized either at BglII or EcoRI sites (Fig. 6A); the BglII-linearized version ends 212 bp downstream of the stop codon and corresponds closely to the 3.5-kb mRNA, while the EcoRI-linearized form terminates 892 bp farther 3′ and represents the longer transcript. Both cRNAs produced typical rapidly inactivating K+ currents when expressed in Xenopus oocytes, although the shorter transcript produced ∼4-5-fold more mKv1.4 currents than the longer one (Fig. 6B). Clearly, the presence of the additional 3′-NCR sequence in the 4.5-kb mRNA reduces functional channel expression in oocytes (Fig. 6, B and C). This region is 66% AU-rich and contains five AUUUA repeats that are conserved in rat and bovine homologues of Kv1.4 (Fig. 3B, 1 and 3). These motifs are also present in the 3′-NCRs of many other genes expressed in diverse mammalian cell types (14Duret L. Dorkel F. Gautier C.

The presence of three or more such repeats, either by themselves or as part of the larger nonanucleotide motif (UUAUUUA(A/U)(A/U)), has been reported to reduce mRNA stability in almost every case examined (e.g. 14Duret L. Dorkel F. Gautier C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2315-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 15Asson-Batres M.A. Spurgeon S.L. Diaz J. DeLoughery T.G. Bagby G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Blood. 1994; 83: 3182-3187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In view of this, it seems very likely that the 3′-NCR of Kv1.4 has a destabilizing effect on the 4.5-kb transcript in mammalian cells. In Xenopus oocytes, however, AUUUA-mediated mRNA degradation is minimal; this mechanism therefore cannot account for the decreased expression of the 4.5-kb transcript in oocytes. The octanucleotide repeat, UUAUUUAU, has been reported to inhibit translation of diverse messages in oocytes and in in vitro translation systems (19Kruys V.I. Wathelet M.G. Huez G.A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 72: 191-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 20Kruys V.I. Marinx O. Shaw G. Deschamps J. Huez G. Science. 1989; 245: 852-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 21Kruys V.I. Beutler B. Huez G. Enzyme. 1990; 44: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 22Marinx O. Bertrand S.

A. 1987; 84: 6030-6034Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). While the 3′-NCR of mKv1.4 does not contain this octanucleotide motif (Fig. 5), we considered the possibility that the shorter AUUUA motif might possess translation inhibitory activity. To test this idea, we coupled a reporter gene (gene-10-containing Kv1.3) to mKv1.4 3′-NCR sequences containing 0–5 ATTTA repeats (Fig. 7A). The presence of 5 AUUUAs decreased expression of the reporter protein 11-fold, while three AUUUAs caused 3.5-fold suppression (Fig. 7C); mutating these three AUUUAs to AGUGA completely relieved the suppression. The total amount of protein loaded in each of these lanes was roughly equal, as evidenced by the Coomassie stain of a 100-kDa endogenous oocyte protein (Fig. 7D). The presence of the AUUUA repeats did not appreciably alter levels of Kv1.4 cRNA during the course of the experiment (Fig. 7B). The levels of [32P]CTP-labeled reporter-gene cRNA remained unchanged even after 48 h, regardless of the presence or absence of AUUUAs (Fig. 7B), and densitometric analysis revealed no more than an 8% difference in the intensity of the bands. Thus, the observed AUUUA-mediated reduction in functional expression of the longer 4.5-kb transcript in oocytes must be mediated via suppression of translation. Using the reasoning of Kruys and co-workers (19Kruys V.I. Wathelet M.G. Huez G.A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 72: 191-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 20Kruys V.I. Marinx O. Shaw G.

A. 1987; 84: 6030-6034Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), we argue that the AUUUA-motifs in the Kv1.4 3′-NCR might also reduce translational efficiency of the 4.5-kb mRNA in mammalian cells. To identify the mKv1.4 promoter, 5′-flanking regions upstream of exon 1 were engineered either into the pLuciferase-enhancer or the basic vector (see “Materials and Methods”). These were transfected into two cell lines (C2C12, NIH-3T3), and luciferase activity was measured; of the two, only C2C12 cells are known to express Kv1.4 (10Lesage F. Attali B. Lazdunski M. Barhanin J. FEBS Lett. 1992; 310: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). A 2.1-kb SacI/BamHI fragment was found to confer very high levels of promoter activity in both cell lines (Fig. 8). Deletion of an internal 464-bp PstI fragment eliminated promoter activity suggesting that the basal promoter is located within this region. Consistent with this notion, this PstI fragment, located just upstream of the transcription initiation site (Fig. 4, Fig. 5), induced transcription of the luciferase gene, although at a substantially lower level than the entire SacI/BamHI fragment. These data indicate the presence of additional enhancer element(s) outside the 464-bp PstI fragment. Since DNA fragments may exhibit spurious promoter activity in the presence of powerful enhancers (e.g. SV40 enhancer), it was important to determine if the PstI fragment could induce transcription in the absence of the SV40 enhancer. For this purpose, the fragment was engineered into the basic vector (lacking an enhancer), and transcription of the luciferase gene was measured following transfection into NIH 3T3 cells. The PstI fragment clearly contains a fully functional promoter, since it is capable of initiating transcription of the luciferase gene without the help of an exogenous enhancer (Fig. 8, legend). This region, seen in Fig. 5, is 66% (G/C)-rich, lacks canonical TATAAA and GGCAATCT boxes (24Nussinov R. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1990; 25: 185-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), contains three SP1 sites (CCGCCC), multiple E-boxes (CANNTG) (Myod-1 binding sites), one each of the motifs for fibroblast enhancer (CCAAT) and AP2 (ATTTGC), and resembles the promoters of many housekeeping genes (25Sauerwald A. Hoeshe C. Oschwald R. Kilimann M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14932-14937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Azizkhan J.C. Jensen D.E. Pierce A.J. Wade M. Crit. Rev.

Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8757-8761Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). We report the mapping of two mKv1.4 transcripts, 4.5 and 3.5 kb, that are expressed in brain and heart. These two are identical except in the 3′-NCR, with the longer transcript terminating at a polyadenylation signal 934 nt downstream from the signal utilized by the 3.5-kb form. Although the same coding region is utilized by both transcripts to generate identical mKv1.4 proteins, we have shown that the 3′-NCR regulates the levels of functional channels via AU-dependent regulation of translation efficiency and most likely also of mRNA stability. The presence of multiple ATGs lying upstream of the initiation methionine in the 5′-NCRs of both transcripts would be expected to decrease translational efficiency (Fig. 5). Thus, the unusually long and well conserved NCRs of Kv1.4 play important roles in modulating Kv1.4 channel expression. The promoter for this gene has little if any tissue specificity, is located in a GC-island containing three SP1 binding sites (CCGCCC), and is modulated by at least one region containing enhancer activity. The high GC content of the Kv1.4 promoter might reduce its accessibility to RNA polymerase (e.g. 29Blake M.C. Jambou R.C. Kahn J.W. Azizkhan J.C. Mol. Cell Biol. 1990; 10: 6632-6641Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The mechanisms responsible for tissue-specific expression of this gene have yet to be determined. Positive and negative transcriptional regulators are known to be responsible for tissue- and developmental stage-specific expression of sodium channel genes (30Sheng Z.H. Zhang H. Barchi R.L. Kallen R.G. DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 9-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 31Maue R.A. Kraner S.D. Goodman R.H. Mandel G.

Neuron. 1992; 9: 45-54Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), and similar elements upstream of the SacI/BamHI fragment might be required for tissue-specific expression of mKv1.4. Alternatively, mKv1.4 gene expression might be inactivated by methylation in tissues other than the brain, heart, and skeletal muscle; this GC-rich region, in fact, contains multiple potential methylation sites (33Singer J. Roberts-Ems J. Riggs A.D. Science. 1979; 203: 1019-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 34Albini A. Toffenetti J. Zhu Z. Chader G.J. Noonan D.M.

Future studies will provide answers to these questions and determine whether other K+ channels use similar mechanisms to control their expression. The tight transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of mKv1.4 expression may reflect the need to maintain the number of functional channels at closely defined levels in mammalian tissues. A rapidly inactivating K+ current like mKv1.4, which can open in the subthreshold range of excitation, would likely reduce the excitatory effects of depolarizing currents on neurons in a time-dependent fashion (6Ruppersberg J.P. Frank R. Pongs O. Stocker M. Nature. 1991; 17: 657-660Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar); a deficit of Kv1.4 current might therefore enhance neural excitability, while increased numbers of such channels may have hypoexcitatory effects. Alteration of transcriptional or post-transcriptional processes might be associated with pathological states, possibly contributing, for example, to the enhanced Kv1.4 mRNA expression seen in cardiac hypertrophy (36Matsubara H. Suzuki J. Inada M. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1659-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We thank Drs.

A mechanism for the folding reactions of vitronectin has been proposed (Zhuang, P., Blackburn, M. N., and Peterson, C. B. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 14323-14332) in which vitronectin acquires a partially folded intermediate structure which is highly prone to oligomerize into a multimeric form. Strongly oxidizing conditions adopted for refolding from urea were effective at preventing disulfide rearrangement which disrupts distal disulfides near the C terminus of the protein. Prohibiting disulfide rearrangement under these conditions, however, was not sufficient to achieve reversibility in folding. In contrast, variations in the ionic strength of the refolding medium affect the partitioning of species so that refolded monomers are obtained at high ionic strength, and self-association is precluded. The effects of ionic strength on the partially folded intermediate in the vitronectin folding pathway appear to favor intramolecular hydrophobic collapse to form a stable hydrophobic core for the monomer versus intermolecular hydrophobic interactions which stabilize multimeric vitronectin. Although both ionic and hydrophobic interactions presumably contribute to subunit interfaces within the multimer, the basic heparin-binding region near the C terminus of the protein does not provide binding interactions which are important for self-association of vitronectin.

Vitronectin is a multi-functional protein which is found in a plasma form, which circulates in the bloodstream at high concentrations, and in tissue forms, which are present within platelets, deposited into the extracellular matrix of endothelial cells, or localized to other extravascular sites. The multiple functions of vitronectin are a manifestation of specific interactions with many other macromolecules, including the integrin class of receptors on cells, the inactive antithrombin-thrombin complex, the terminal membrane attack complex of complement, collagen and other extracellular matrix components, plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1, and the mucopolysaccharide, heparin. Binding of these target ligands appears to be modulated through alterations in the conformation of vitronectin, an observation that was originally noted for interactions with heparin (1Barnes D.W. Reing J.E. Amos B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9117-9122Google Scholar, 2Hayashi M. Akama T. Kono I. Kashiwagi H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1985; 98: 1135-1138Google Scholar) and subsequently extended to other physiologically relevant macromolecules (reviewed in 3Preissner K.T. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 275-310Google Scholar, 4Preissner K.T. Jenne D. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1991; 66: 123-132Google Scholar, 5Preissner K.T. Blut. 1989; 59: 419-431Google Scholar, 6Tomasini B.R. Mosher D.F. Prog. Hemostasis Thromb. 1991; 10: 269-305Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies have been useful to demonstrate the conformational lability of vitronectin (7Tomasini B.R. Mosher D.F. Blood. 1988; 72: 903-912Google Scholar, 8Tomasini B.R. Owen M.C. Fenton II, J.W. Mosher D.F. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7617-7623Google Scholar, 9Bittorf S.V. Williams E.C. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24838-24846Google Scholar, 10Seiffert D. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 155-159Google Scholar), which has been characterized using chemical or thermal denaturation methods to mimic the more physiologically relevant stimuli for structural rearrangement. Justification for this approach came early in the evaluation of structural changes in vitronectin, with the demonstration by Tomasini and Mosher (7Tomasini B.R. Mosher D.F. Blood. 1988; 72: 903-912Google Scholar) using monoclonal antibody 8E6 that conformational alterations induced upon treatment with urea were similar to those observed upon association of vitronectin with the antithrombin-thrombin complex. Comparison between plasma vitronectin and tissue-associated forms is by no means complete, but several recent studies have indicated that non-circulating forms of the protein exist in the structurally-altered form, detected by several conformation-specific monoclonal antibodies, including the 8E6 prototype (11Stockmann A. Hess S. Declerck P. Timpl R. Preissner K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22874-22882Google Scholar). The structural basis for the conformational lability of vitronectin is incompletely understood. Alterations in the conformation of vitronectin induced by chemical denaturation are notably accompanied by self-association to form vitronectin multimers in vitro (9Bittorf S.V. Williams E.C. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24838-24846Google Scholar, 11Stockmann A. Hess S. Declerck P. Timpl R. Preissner K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22874-22882Google Scholar, 12Zhuang P.

In a companion paper (12Zhuang P. Blackburn M.N. Peterson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 270: 14323-14332Google Scholar), spectroscopic methods were used to characterize structural changes which accompany unfolding and subsequent refolding of purified plasma vitronectin. Unfolding and refolding curves generated by varying concentrations of chemical denaturants were non-coincident, although precautions were taken to ensure complete unfolding prior to renaturation. Refolding from high denaturant concentrations was accompanied by association to a multimeric form of vitronectin with an average molecular weight of 420,000. The hysteresis observed is indicative of different pathways for unfolding versus refolding and/or the conversion of vitronectin from one stable form to a second, differently folded structure. Scheme 1 can be used to describe the folding and self-association of vitronectin. V represents the native, monomeric form of vitronectin, V* an intermediate, partially folded form of the protein, U the fully unfolded form, and Mv, the multimeric form of vitronectin. Folding of vitronectin appears to be regulated by partitioning of folding intermediates toward either of two conformations, one that exists as a stable monomer and another that associates into a multimeric form. Partial unfolding of vitronectin results in a pronounced tendency for the protein to self-associate, and refolding of the protein following chemical or thermal denaturation is invariably accompanied by oligomerization to the multimeric form at physiological ionic strengths. This study expands on the work which germinated Scheme I to consider the following questions. Does intramolecular disulfide rearrangement stabilize an alternative fold with a tendency to multimerize? Are there conditions which favor refolding of vitronectin to a monomeric form without self-association as a prominent side reaction? What effect do charged biomolecules or salts have on the distribution of refolded vitronectin between monomeric and multimeric forms? What contributions do ionic and hydrophobic interactions make to the process of self-association of vitronectin? Does the heparin-binding region of vitronectin contribute intermolecular interactions which participate in oligomerization to the multimeric form? Analytical and immunochemical approaches have been used to address these questions and gain insight into the mechanism by which multimeric vitronectin is produced. Vitronectin was purified by a modification of the original procedure of Dahlback and Podack (14Dahlback B. Podack E.R. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2368-2374Google Scholar), essentially as described by Bittorf et al. (9Bittorf S.V. Williams E.C. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24838-24846Google Scholar). The modifications of Bittorf et al. (9Bittorf S.V. Williams E.C. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24838-24846Google Scholar) include addition of DTNB 2J. A. Lamerdin, C. B. Peterson, and E. H.

Chem. 1993; 268: 24838-24846Google Scholar) indicate that there is not clear evidence that DTNB is maintained on vitronectin throughout the protein preparation, since reduction of the purified vitronectin sample with dithiothreitol was not accompanied by release of the thionitrobenzoate anion (9Bittorf S.V. Williams E.C. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24838-24846Google Scholar). Purity was assessed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of β-mercaptoethanol (15Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). A molecular weight for the protein of 72,000 and an extinction coefficient of 1.02 ml·mg−1·cm−1 were used for purified vitronectin (12Zhuang P. Blackburn M.N. Peterson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 270: 14323-14332Google Scholar). The number of free sulfhydryls in purified vitronectin was determined under native, denaturing, or reducing conditions using DTNB (16Robyt J.F. White B.J. Biochemical Techniques: Theory and Practice. Waveland Press, Prospect Heights, IL1987Google Scholar). Multimeric vitronectin was prepared by treatment of protein in 8 M urea at room temperature for 2 h, with subsequent removal of denaturant by dialysis into standard phosphate buffer (0.1 M sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, containing 0.15 M NaCl and 1 mM EDTA). Heat-denatured vitronectin was prepared by incubating the protein in phosphate-buffered saline (40 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, containing 0.15 M NaCl) or standard phosphate buffer at 55°C for 1–2 h and subsequent cooling on ice (10Seiffert D.

The 18-residue peptide which corresponds to amino acids 346 to 363 in vitronectin, LAKKQRFRHRNRKGYRSQ, was purchased from Chiron Mimetopes. The peptide from the commercial vendor was greater than 85% pure and was used without further purification. The amino acid sequence of the peptide was confirmed by amino acid analysis and NMR characterization, and heparin binding activity was established by fluorescence methods during the initial structural work on the peptide. 1The abbreviations used are: DTNBdithionitrobenzoateGdnHClguanidine hydrochloridePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisGSH and GSSGthe reduced and oxidized forms of glutathione, respectivelymAbmonoclonal antibodyELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayCpn60 and Cpn70charperonins 60 and 70 (sometimes referred to as Hsp60 and Hsp70)HPLChigh performance liquid chromatography.

Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) 153 and 1244 were obtained by standard hybridoma techniques using denatured vitronectin as the immunogen (17Seiffert D. Ciambrone G. Wagner N.V. Binder B.R. Loskutoff D.J. J Biol Chem. 1994; 269: 2659-2666Google Scholar), and the hybridoma clone producing mAb 8E6 was kindly provided by Dr. Deane Mosher (University of Wisconsin). MAbs were produced as ascites, and the resulting IgG was purified by using protein A-agarose (mAbs 153 and 1244) or by the caprylic acid method (mAb 8E6) (18Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Native PAGE was performed using a 3% polyacrylamide stacking gel and 7.5% polyacrylamide resolving gel run in the Laemmli buffer system (15Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) without SDS. For Western blotting, proteins in the gel were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and analyzed using mAb 1244 as described (17Seiffert D. Ciambrone G. Wagner N.V. Binder B.R. Loskutoff D.J. J Biol Chem. 1994; 269: 2659-2666Google Scholar). Binding of the anti-vitronectin antibodies was detected using 125I-labeled sheep anti-mouse IgG. Conformational changes in vitronectin were quantified by a competitive ELISA method principally as described (7Tomasini B.R. Mosher D.F. Blood. 1988; 72: 903-912Google Scholar, 9Bittorf S.V. Williams E.C. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24838-24846Google Scholar, 10Seiffert D. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 155-159Google Scholar), in which mAb binding is partitioned between denatured vitronectin coated on microtiter wells and competing vitronectin in solution. Bound IgG was detected with biotin-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, followed by streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate, and the substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate in a final step. In the concentration range used for the experiments, the addition of amino acids or NaCl did not interfere with the binding of mAbs to immobilized vitronectin; neither did the added reagents remove coated vitronectin from the microtiter wells. Vitronectin at a concentration of 5 µM was treated overnight with 5 M urea, a concentration of denaturant very near the midpoint in the unfolding curve (12Zhuang P. Blackburn M.N. Peterson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 270: 14323-14332Google Scholar) which has been shown to lead to rearrangement of disulfides (9Bittorf S.V. Williams E.C. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24838-24846Google Scholar). Various combinations of oxidized and reduced glutathione were added along with 5 M urea to individual vitronectin samples to vary the redox potential during unfolding from strongly oxidizing to strongly reducing potentials. Urea solutions were made fresh for each experiment. Redox potential was calculated from the Nernst equation as follows, Eh=E∘+(2.303RT/nF)×log([GSSG]/[GS−]2)(Eq. 1) in which E°, the standard redox potential for glutathione is −0.24 V (19Huth J.R. Perini F. Lockridge O. Bedows E. Ruddon R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16472-16482Google Scholar), n equals 2, R is the gas constant, 8.314 J·K−1·mol−1, and F is Faraday's constant, 97,485 C·mol−1. Samples were analyzed for disulfide rearrangement on 10% SDS-PAGE gels in which samples were prepared in loading buffer without added reducing agents (i.e. non-reducing SDS-PAGE). Electrophoresis was performed according to Laemmli (15Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). Native and multimeric proteins were analyzed by HPLC using a Beckman ultraspherogel SEC2000 column (7.5 mm × 30 cm) at a flow rate of 1 ml·min−1 in standard phosphate buffer. Samples were generally 1 mg·ml−1 in concentration, and 20-µl samples were analyzed per run. Elution of protein from the column was monitored by absorbance at 280 nm. Retention times characteristic of monomeric and multimeric vitronectin were 6.8 ± 0.1 and 5.6 ± 0.1 min, respectively. In a similar fashion, analytical gel filtration was performed in some experiments using a Superose-12 column (1 × 30 cm; 23.7-ml bed volume) with a Pharmacia FPLC system. Vitronectin (1 mg·ml−1) was denatured for 16 h in 5 M urea in standard phosphate buffer, and the same denaturant solution was used for chromatography at flow rates of 0.5 ml·min−1. Duplicate experiments were performed in 5 M urea in standard phosphate buffer plus 10 mM GSSG. Initial sample volume applied to the column was 0.5 ml or less. Protein elution patterns were detected by monitoring absorbance at 280 nm. Unfolding and refolding of vitronectin were induced by GdnHCl and monitored by changes in intrinsic protein fluorescence, as described (12Zhuang P. Blackburn M.N. Peterson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 270: 14323-14332Google Scholar). Buffer used for the unfolding and refolding experiments was standard phosphate buffer containing 0.04% Tween 20. For experiments to test the effects of limiting disulfide rearrangement, the same buffer was used with the addition of 10 mM GSSG. Aliquots from a concentrated protein stock were diluted to a final concentration of 0.5 µM protein in varying concentrations of denaturant. Samples were incubated at room temperature overnight to ensure complete unfolding before the measurements were made. For refolding studies, vitronectin was first unfolded in 7 M GdnHCl in standard phosphate buffer plus 10 mM GSSG for 16 h. Aliquots of vitronectin in 7 M GdnHCl were then diluted 10-fold into mixtures of buffer and GdnHCl solution, both containing 10 mM GSSG, and again incubated overnight. GdnHCl concentrations were calculated using equations relating refractive indexes to concentrations (20Pace C.N. Shirley B.A. Thomson J.A. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure: A Pracical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1990: 311Google Scholar), and refractive indexes were measured using a Zeiss refractometer. Although vitronectin has been proposed to contain cysteines in a combination of oxidized disulfides and reduced -SH forms, the number of free sulfhydryls in vitronectin has been disputed (9Bittorf S.V. Williams E.C. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24838-24846Google Scholar, 14Dahlback B. Podack E.R. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2368-2374Google Scholar, 21Preissner K.T. Wassmuth R. Muller-Berghaus G. Biochem. J. 1985; 231: 349-355Google Scholar). In order to quantitate free sulfhydryls in the purified protein used for these experiments, vitronectin was treated with DTNB under native and denaturing conditions. Native vitronectin was found to have essentially no available free sulfhydryls, consistent with previous observations (9Bittorf S.V. Williams E.C. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24838-24846Google Scholar), whereas vitronectin denatured in 6 M urea contained 2 sulfhydryls (Table I). These results indicate that vitronectin contains a mixture of oxidized and reduced sulfur groups, and that the free sulfhydryls are buried in the native protein. It is not until vitronectin is denatured that these sulfhydryls are exposed and available to promote disulfide rearrangement in the protein. DTNB reactions on fully denatured and reduced vitronectin gave an average of 12.1 -SH groups per protein molecule, in fair agreement with the 14 sulfhydryls expected from the known sequence of the protein (22Suzuki S. Oldberg A. Hayman E.G. Pierschbacher M.D. Ruoslahti E. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2519-2524Google Scholar).Table I.Determination of free sulhydryls in native and denatured vitronectinExperimental conditions(mol TNB)/(mol protein)aMol of thionitrobenzoate anion released per mol of protein.

It was noted early in the work on urea denaturation of vitronectin that disulfide rearrangement occurs upon chemical treatment (7Tomasini B.R. Mosher D.F. Blood. 1988; 72: 903-912Google Scholar, 8Tomasini B.R. Owen M.C. Fenton II, J.W. Mosher D.F. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7617-7623Google Scholar). This observation was made from SDS-PAGE run under non-reducing conditions in which disulfide rearrangement disrupts interchain cross-links between the 62,000 and 10,000 polypeptide chains of vitronectin and two polypeptides are observed on gels rather than a single 72,000 species. Although disulfide rearrangement could result in intermolecular cross-linking of constituent proteins within multimeric vitronectin, only a minority of chains within the multimer are linked by disulfide bonds (12Zhuang P. Blackburn M.N. Peterson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 270: 14323-14332Google Scholar) so that the multimer is not uniformly cross-linked. Although intermolecular disulfides are not uniform within the multimer and thus do not fully account for assembly of the multimer, the possibility exists that intramolecular disulfide rearrangement stabilizes an alternative conformation of vitronectin which is prone to self-associate upon refolding. To test this hypothesis, variations in redox potential during unfolding and refolding were used to define conditions which prohibit disulfide rearrangement. Fig. 1 shows the effects of varying redox potential with GSH and GSSG during unfolding. A clear trend is observed in which appearance of the 62,000 chain upon release of the 10,000 fragment is minimized as unfolding reactions are conducted under strongly oxidizing conditions. Under the most highly oxidizing conditions tested, disulfide rearrangement appears to be prohibited. Exposed sulfhydryls are prevented from catalyzing intramolecular disulfide rearrangement within vitronectin due to the great excess of glutathione, which provides a small molecular weight substrate for disulfide exchange and formation of mixed disulfides. The results of the SDS-PAGE were confirmed by using analytical gel filtration to test for dissociation of the disulfide cross-linked two-chain form of vitronectin to separated 62,000 and 10,000 chains upon denaturation in 5 M urea plus or minus 10 mM GSSG (Fig. 2). Under normal denaturation conditions without added glutathione, urea treatment results in disruption of the covalent disulfide cross-link between the 62,000 and 10,000 chains of vitronectin, so a late eluting peak corresponding to the 10,000 polypeptide is clearly seen on analytical gel filtration. In contrast, addition of oxidized glutathione to the denaturation mixture prevented the disulfide rearrangement which leads to release of the 10,000 C-terminal fragment, and a single peak corresponding to a 72,000 species was observed in analytical gel filtration under these conditions. Within the limitations of these assays, it appears that highly oxidizing conditions conferred during unfolding of vitronectin prohibit intra- or intermolecular disulfide rearrangement. Hysteresis between unfolding and refolding curves was noted in the absence of GSSG and can be attributed either to the possibility that the two processes proceed via different pathways or to the prospect of a different fold for native compared to denatured/renatured vitronectin. Since oxidizing conditions prevented disulfide rearrangement, GSSG was included in the denaturation mixtures, and unfolding and refolding behavior were tested as a function of GdnHCl by monitoring changes in intrinsic fluorescence of the protein (12Zhuang P. Blackburn M.N. Peterson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 270: 14323-14332Google Scholar). The results shown in Fig. 3 exhibit hysteresis between unfolding and refolding curves, demonstrating that inclusion of GSSG in the reactions to stem disulfide rearrangement does not lead to reversible unfolding/refolding behavior. Midpoints for the denaturation curves and intensity-averaged wavelengths corresponding to folded and unfolded protein are summarized in Table II. Values are also listed in Table II for GdnHCl unfolding/refolding curves generated without GSSG (12Zhuang P. Blackburn M.N. Peterson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 270: 14323-14332Google Scholar); parameters describing unfolding and refolding of vitronectin in GdnHCl are virtually indistinguishable regardless of addition of GSSG.Table II.Behavior of native and multimeric vitronectin in chemical denaturation/renaturation experimentsVitronectin sampleaSamples are labeled according to the state of the starting material for the experiment as: native, corresponding to the untreated monomeric protein; multimer, corresponding to urea treated protein which is subsequently renatured at physiological ionic strength; and heat treated, corresponding to the protein heated to 55°C and cooled at physiological ionic strength as described under “Experimental Procedures,” heat-treated/refolded protein has been heated at 55°C and cooled to room temperature in buffer containing 1 M NaCl; urea-treated/refolded protein has been denatured overnight in 8 M urea followed by dialysis into 0.1 M sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, containing 1 mM EDTA and 1 M NaCl.DenaturantMidpoint (M)FbThe intensity averaged wavelength corresponding to folded, F, or unfolded, U, protein.

https://openalex.org/W1988839252,"The binding of ligands to N-formyl peptide chemoattractant receptors in human neutrophils results in a rapid association of these receptors with a cytoskeletal fraction and a specific activation and release of Gi2α-subunits from this fraction. In the present study we could show that pretreating neutrophils with GDPβS prevented the fMet-Leu-Phe-induced association of its receptor with a cytoskeletal fraction and also blocked the release of Gi2α-subunits from the same cytoskeletal fraction. In contrast, direct activation of Gi2 proteins by addition of GTPγS or AlF−4 not only caused a release of Gi2α-subunits from the cytoskeleton but also an association of formyl peptide receptors with the cytoskeleton.

The present findings suggest a possible mechanism for the initiation of formyl peptide receptor desensitization during neutrophil locomotion. Human neutrophils are phagocytic cells specialized in the destruction of invading microorganisms. To perform this important role in host defense, these cells emigrate from the blood vessels to the sites of infection. This directed locomotion, as well as other neutrophil responses, is triggered by chemotactic factors, e.g. complement fragment 5a (C5a), 1The abbreviations used are: C5acomplement fragment 5aFPRformyl peptide receptorfMet-Leu-PheN-formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanineG-proteinGTP-binding proteinGi2α-subunitα-subunit of the Gi2 proteinGnαα-subunit of the Gi2 proteinGsα-subunitα-subunit of the Gs proteinGDPβSguanosine-5′-O-(2-thiodiphosphate)GTPγSguanosine-5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate)PVDFpolyvinylidene difluorideTX-100Triton X-100. leukotriene B4, and N-formylated peptides. Many of the receptors for these ligands have been cloned (Boulay et al., 3Boulay F. Tardif M. Brouchon L. Vignais P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 168: 1103-1109Google Scholar; Gerard and Gerard, 7Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9274-9281Google Scholar) and shown to belong to a subclass of small seven-transmembrane-spanning G-protein-coupled receptors (Probst et al., 19Probst W.C. Snyder L.A. Schuster D.I. Brosius J. Sealfor S.C. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 1-20Google Scholar; Prossnitz et al., 20Prossnitz E.R. Quehenberger O. Cochrane C.G. Ye R.D. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 581-587Google Scholar). Related chemoattractant receptors show a greater degree of homology in their intracellular domains than in their extracellular domains, suggesting that they may have common mechanisms of signal transduction and receptor regulation (Ye et al., 31Ye R.D. Prossnitz E.R. Zou A.H. Cochrane C.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 180: 105-111Google Scholar). The neutrophil receptor for N-formylated peptides (FPR) is one of the most thoroughly studied chemoattractant receptors (for review, see Murphy, 17Murphy P.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 593-633Google Scholar). This receptor is a glycosylated protein with an apparent molecular mass of 50–70 kDa, as estimated by photoaffinity labeling (Tardif et al., 29Tardif M. Mery L. Brouchon L. Boulay F. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 3534-3545Google Scholar; Sengeløv et al., 24Sengeløv H. Boulay F. Kjeldsen L. Borregaard N. Biochem.

To be able to move in a chemotactic gradient, motile cells like the human neutrophil must respond to changes in the concentration of one or probably several stimuli. In part, this is achieved by an adaptive process that results in a blunted response despite the permanent presence of agonists. This process, which is also called desensitization, involves receptor down-regulation by internalization as well as more rapid mechanisms by which components of the signaling pathway are modified. In general, two types of desensitization have been characterized, and these are designated homologous and heterologous (Sibley and Lefkowitz, 26Sibley D.R. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1985; 317: 124-129Google Scholar). Homologous desensitization affects only the receptor system that has been activated by an agonist, whereas heterologous desensitization also inactivates other receptors coupled to the same effector system. Both types of desensitization results in the uncoupling of receptors from their effector enzymes. Several potentially interrelated mechanisms for how the receptor-G-protein interaction are altered when cells get desensitized have been demonstrated and hypothesized (Sibley et al., 27Sibley D.R. Strasser R.H. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3883-3886Google Scholar; McLeish et al., 16McLeish K.R. Gierschik P. Jakobs K.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 36: 384-390Google Scholar). Considering the neutrophil FPR, it has previously been suggested that binding to the cytoskeleton is an important step in the desensitization of this receptor to chemotactic peptides (Jesaitis et al., 10Jesaitis A.J. Naemura J.R. Sklar L.A. Cochrane C.G. Painter R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 1378-1387Google Scholar; Jesaitis et al., 11Jesaitis A.J. Tolley J.O. Allen R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13662-13669Google Scholar). In addition to the association of FPRs with the cytoskeleton, a lateral segregation of the FPR from its G-protein has also been observed (Jesaitis et al., 12Jesaitis A.J. Tolley J.O. Bokoch G.M. Allen R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2783-2790Google Scholar; for review, see Jesaitis, 9Jesaitis A.J. Comments Mol. Cell Biophys. 1992; 8: 97-114Google Scholar). Such segregation could well be a consequence of the N-formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine (fMet-Leu-Phe)-induced release of the α-subunits of the Gi2 protein (Gi2α-subunits) from the cytoskeleton (Särndahl et al., 23Särndahl E. Bokoch G.M. Stendahl O. Andersson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6552-6556Google Scholar) and would, as part of the desensitization process, serve to keep the FPR from transducing its signal to its corresponding G-protein. Although both the activation and cellular handling of Gi2 proteins and FPRs are most likely of importance in the desensitization process, it is still unclear whether they are in any way interrelated. The present study was performed to reveal whether or not the activation and release of Gi2α-subunits from the cytoskeleton and the association of FPRs with the cytoskeleton are interdependent processes. This was done to gain further knowledge about the desensitization of FPRs that is necessary for neutrophil locomotion. All reagents used were of an analytical grade. Dextran and Ficoll-Paque were from Pharmacia Biotech (Sollentuna, Sweden), fMet-Leu-Phe was obtained from Sigma, and GDPβS and GTPγS were both from Boehringer Mannheim (Mannheim, Germany). The peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antiserum was obtained from Dako A/S (Glostrup, Denmark), and the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system was from Amersham Int. (Buckinghamshire, U. K.). The affinity purified rabbit anti-FPR antibody was raised against amino acid 340–350 of the carboxyl tail of the human FPR (i.e. the FPR C-terminal peptide; Tardif et al., 29Tardif M. Mery L. Brouchon L. Boulay F. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 3534-3545Google Scholar). The rabbit antiserum R16,17 was raised against a peptide corresponding to the 9-amino acid C-terminal sequence of Gi and was shown to react specifically with Gi2α > Gi1α> Gi3α or Goα (Bokoch et al., 2Bokoch G.M.

After sedimentation on dextran, the neutrophils were isolated according to the method described by 4Böyum A. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. 1968; 97: 77-89Google Scholar. The obtained cell suspension, which consisted of approximately 98% neutrophils, was washed twice and then resuspended in a calcium-containing medium as described previously (Särndahl et al., 23Särndahl E. Bokoch G.M. Stendahl O. Andersson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6552-6556Google Scholar). The cells were routinely pretreated with 2.5 mM diisopropyl fluorophosphate for 10 min and then kept on ice pending further processing. Neutrophils were electrically permeabilized according to a previously described method (Särndahl et al., 22Särndahl E. Lindroth M. Bengtsson T. Fällman M. Gustavsson J. Stendahl O. Andersson T. J.

The cells were kept on ice and rendered permeable by repeated exposures (150 µs each) to an electrical field of 1.7 kV/cm. After permeabilization, the cells were immediately exposed to stimuli, as indicated in the figure legends. Cytoskeletal fractions were prepared using Triton X-100 (TX-100) as described by Särndahl et al. (22Särndahl E. Lindroth M. Bengtsson T. Fällman M. Gustavsson J. Stendahl O. Andersson T. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2791-2799Google Scholar, 23Särndahl E. Bokoch G.M. Stendahl O. Andersson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6552-6556Google Scholar). The obtained cytoskeletal preparations were washed once, pelleted, and prepared for electrophoresis by resuspending the pellets in a sample buffer previously described (Särndahl et al., 23Särndahl E. Bokoch G.M. Stendahl O. Andersson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6552-6556Google Scholar). Cytoskeletal preparations were solubilized in sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. Thereafter, the proteins of each sample (1 × 106 cell equivalents per lane) were separated on a 7.5 or 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel to detect FPRs and Gi2α-subunits, respectively. The proteins were then blotted onto a PVDF membrane as described previously (Särndahl et al., 23Särndahl E. Bokoch G.M. Stendahl O. Andersson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6552-6556Google Scholar). The membranes were blocked with 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.3, overnight at 4°C, and then with 0.5% (w/v) dried milk for 30 min at 37°C. The immunoblotting was performed by exposing the PVDF membranes to the different primary antibodies, after which a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was added and the immune reaction was detected as enhanced chemiluminescence. When using the anti-FPR antibody, control experiments were performed by adding the antibody (1:300 dilution) to the FPR C-terminal peptide against which the antibody had been raised (10 µg/ml) for 24 h at 4°C. This mixture was then added to the PVDF membrane, and the immune reaction was detected as described above. Densitometric analysis was performed with an UltroScan XL enhanced laser densitometer (LKB, Bromma, Sweden). In a previous study (Särndahl et al., 22Särndahl E. Lindroth M. Bengtsson T. Fällman M. Gustavsson J. Stendahl O. Andersson T. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2791-2799Google Scholar), we used radiolabeled ligand to detect FPR and found that pretreatment of permeabilized cells with GDPβS appeared to prevent the binding of ligand-receptor complexes to the cytoskeleton. However, it is possible that these results actually reflected a decreased binding of the radiolabeled ligand to the receptor and not a true reduction in the binding of the ligand-receptor complex to the cytoskeleton. On the other hand, our original interpretation is supported by the present finding that the association between the FPR and the cytoskeleton was inhibited in GDPβS-treated neutrophils, as shown by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1A). The affinity purified anti-FPR antibody we used detected a rather thin and distinct protein band at approximately 55 kDa, which is somewhat different to the protein band(s) that Sengelφv et al. (1994) observed as a smear around 50–70 kDa when photolabeling were used. The specificity of the binding of the antibody in the present study was confirmed by the finding that if the anti-FPR antibody was preincubated with the peptide against which the antibody was raised, this resulted in a failure to detect the 55-kDa protein band (data not shown). Although not addressed in the present study, it is possible that the association of FPRs with the cytoskeleton is somehow associated with a structural modification of the receptor. Using the same batch of cells, GDPβS was also noted to have an inhibitory effect on the fMet-Leu-Phe-induced release of the 40-kDa Gi2α-subunit from the cytoskeleton (Fig. 1B). Densitometer analysis of these blots revealed that 94 ± 1% (mean ± S.E., n = 4) of the 40-kDa protein band remained associated with the cytoskeletal fraction in GDPβS-pretreated neutrophils after fMet-Leu-Phe stimulation in contrast to 23 ± 4% (mean ± S.E., n = 5) when not pretreated with GDPβS. Despite the effects of GDPβS noted in the presence of fMet-Leu-Phe, GDPβS alone was not found to have any effect on the binding of either FPRs or Gi2α-subunits to the cytoskeleton (data not shown). The association of FPRs with the cytoskeleton was further examined by incubating the cells with GTPγS or AlF−4 to activate the G-protein in a ligand-independent manner. As shown in Fig. 2A (2nd and 5th lanes), GTPγS and AlF−4, respectively, induced an association between the receptor and the cytoskeleton, even in the absence of fMet-Leu-Phe. These effects were quite comparable with the association obtained when using fMet-Leu-Phe alone (Fig. 2A, 3rd and 6th lanes). Parallel immunoblot analysis also confirmed that both GTPγS and AlF−4 induced a release of Gi2α-subunits from the cytoskeletal fraction (Fig. 2B, 2nd and 5th lanes) that was quite similar to that observed upon stimulation with fMet-Leu-Phe alone (Fig. 2B, 3rd and 6th lanes, and Fig. 1B). Densitometer analysis revealed that only 22 ± 7 and 26 ± 6% (mean ± S.E., n = 6 and 5) of the 40-kDa protein band remained associated with the cytoskeletal fraction after GTPγS- or AlF−4 activation, respectively. The receptor for C5a, which is known to couple to Gi2 proteins, caused a release of Gi2α-subunits from the cytoskeleton (Fig. 3B, 2nd lane) similar to that caused by fMet-Leu-Phe (Fig. 3B, 3rd lane, and Fig. 1B). Densitometer analysis revealed that only 33 ± 5% (mean ± S.E., n = 4) of the 40-kDa protein band remained associated with the cytoskeletal fraction after C5a stimulation. Of even greater interest, C5a stimulation led to an association between FPRs and the cytoskeleton (Fig. 3A, 2nd lane). Since these findings were obtained with a natural ligand that is known to activate Gi2 proteins, they confirm the results gained by direct manipulation of the Gi2 proteins with GTPγS and AlF−4 (Fig. 2). To examine the kinetics of the release of Gi2α-subunits and the interaction of FPRs with the cytoskeleton, neutrophils were stimulated with fMet-Leu-Phe at 15°C. At that temperature, the receptor is converted into a high affinity form and becomes associated with the cytoskeletal fraction but is not internalized (Jesaitis et al., 10Jesaitis A.J. Naemura J.R. Sklar L.A. Cochrane C.G. Painter R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 1378-1387Google Scholar; Sklar et al., 28Sklar L.A. Finney D.A. Oades Z.G. Jesaitis A.J. Painter R.G. Cochrane C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5661-5669Google Scholar); in contrast, internalization occurs rapidly at 37°C (t1/2 15–20 s; Janeczek et al., 8Janeczek A.H. Marasco W.A. Van Alten P.J. Walter R.J. J. Cell Sci. 1989; 94: 155-168Google Scholar). Only very few FPRs could be detected in the cytoskeletal fraction of unstimulated neutrophils (Fig. 4A, inset, 1st lane). The fMet-Leu-Phe-induced association of FPR with the cytoskeletal fraction occurred rapidly and then leveled off (Fig. 4A, and inset, 2nd through 4th lanes). Concurrently, the number of 40-kDa Gi2α-subunits associated with the cytoskeletal fraction of unstimulated neutrophils (Fig. 4B, inset, 1st lane) decreased upon stimulation with fMet-Leu-Phe. Comparison of the cellular handling of FPRs and Gi2α-subunits reveals that the fMet-Leu-Phe-induced association of FPRs with the cytoskeleton precedes the release of Gi2α-subunits from the same cellular fraction (Fig. 4). Using the immunoblot technique and antibodies directed against the FPR or the Gi2α-subunit, we studied the interdependence of the binding of chemotactic peptide receptors to the cytoskeleton and the activation and release of Gi2α-subunits from the cytoskeleton. Exposing neutrophils to GDPβS, a GDP analogue that keeps the G-protein in an inactivated state, prevented the chemotactic peptide-induced release of Gi2α-subunits from the cytoskeletal fraction and also inhibited the association of FPRs with the cytoskeleton. These findings suggest that binding of FPRs to the cytoskeleton is regulated by a G-protein, as previously proposed (Särndahl et al., 22Särndahl E. Lindroth M. Bengtsson T. Fällman M. Gustavsson J. Stendahl O. Andersson T. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2791-2799Google Scholar). In the cited investigation, we used a radiolabeled ligand to detect FPRs when measuring the effects of GDPβS; hence, it is possible that the results actually reflect a reduced binding affinity between the ligand and its receptor. This alternative interpretation is based on the fact that both GDPβS and GTPγS cause a concentration-dependent reduction in the affinity of the FPR for its ligand (Koo et al., 14Koo C. Lefkowitz R.J. Snyderman R. J. Clin. Invest. 1983; 72: 748-753Google Scholar; Posner et al., 18Posner R.G. Fay S.P. Domalewski M.D. Sklar L.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 65-73Google Scholar). However, in the present study we employed an immunoblot technique to directly detect the receptor protein itself and also found that GDPβS and GTPγS affected the FPR cytoskeletal association in completely different ways. We are therefore convinced that the major effect of GDPβS, in this context, is to inhibit the association of FPR with the cytoskeleton. The impaired association of FPR with the cytoskeleton obtained by incubating the cells with GDPβS was obtained in the presence of the commonly used ligand fMet-Leu-Phe. On the other hand, and perhaps of greater interest in the present study, both GTPγS and AlF−4 were found to induce association of FPRs with the cytoskeleton, even in the absence of any natural FPR ligand (Fig. 2A). This means that association of the FPR with the cytoskeleton requires neither the binding of a natural ligand nor the immediate conformational change that occurs in the receptor as a result of that protein-protein interaction. Furthermore, these findings are in agreement with a regulatory role of G-proteins in the process of FPR cytoskeleton association. The fact that stimulation with either GTPγS or AlF−4 triggers an association between FPRs and the cytoskeleton and a parallel release of Gi2α-subunits from the cytoskeleton (Fig. 2B) suggests that the FPR cytoskeletal association might be related to an activation-dependent release of Gi2α-subunits from the cytoskeleton. Analysis of the time dependence of both the binding of FPRs to and the release of Gi2α-subunits from the cytoskeleton (at 15°C) revealed that the former association of FPRs occurred faster than the latter release of Gi2α-subunits. This suggests that a mechanism more complex than a simple protein-for-protein exchange is involved in the FPR cytoskeletal association; however, such a conclusion might be uncertain due to the difference in number of FPRs and Gi2α-subunits. In this context, it should be mentioned that receptor phosphorylation is another step that is most likely involved in desensitization of the FPR, as has previously been demonstrated in the visual system (Wilden et al., 30Wilden U. Hall S.W. Kuhn H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1174-1178Google Scholar) and in the β-adrenergic receptor system (Lefkowitz et al., 15Lefkowitz R.J. Hausdorff W.P. Caron M.G. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1990; 11: 190-194Google Scholar). This supposition is based on the finding that the FPR in differentiated HL60 cells undergoes phosphorylation soon after stimulation (t1/2 around 1 min, Tardif et al., 29Tardif M. Mery L. Brouchon L. Boulay F. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 3534-3545Google Scholar) and that there is a correlation between the phosphorylation and the desensitization of this receptor (Ali et al., 1Ali H. Richardson R.M. Tomhave E.D. Didsbury J.R. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24247-24254Google Scholar). Recently, it has also been suggested based on in vitro experiments that the FPR might be phosphorylated by a cytosolic kinase that has features similar to those of GRK2, a G-protein-coupled receptor kinase (Prossnitz et al., 21Prossnitz E.R. Kim C.M. Benovic J.L. Ye R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1130-1137Google Scholar). The present finding that G-protein activation could be an initial step in the association of FPRs with the cytoskeleton is compatible with the idea that phosphorylation of the FPR is a subsequent step in the desensitization process; this is true because an initial activation of G-proteins is known to activate several downstream protein kinases. A G-protein-induced phosphorylation of the FPR may be required to allow this receptor to become associated with the cytoskeleton and segregated from its Gi2 protein (which at the same time is released from the cytoskeleton). If this is the case, then it is not surprising that desensitization had no effect on the affinity in FPR-G-protein interactions as seen in reconstitution experiments (Klotz and Jesaitis, 13Klotz K.-N. Jesaitis A.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 48: 1297-1300Google Scholar). Additional experiments are needed, however, to determine whether phosphorylation of FPR precedes or follows the association of FPR with the cytoskeleton. Desensitization of the N-formyl peptide receptor was demonstrated several years ago in a number of laboratories (Showell et al., 25Showell H.J. Williams D. Becher E.L. Naccache P.H. Sháafi R. J. Reticuloendothel. Soc. 1979; 25: 139-150Google Scholar; Jesaitis et al., 11Jesaitis A.J. Tolley J.O. Allen R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13662-13669Google Scholar). Notwithstanding, the molecular basis of this process is still unknown, although both homologous and heterologous desensitization appear to be involved (Didsbury et al., 5Didsbury J.R. Uhing R.J. Tomhave E. Gerard C. Gerard N. Snyderman R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11564-11568Google Scholar; McLeish et al., 16McLeish K.R. Gierschik P. Jakobs K.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 36: 384-390Google Scholar). Interestingly, Didsbury and co-workers (1991) proposed that a third type of desensitization, referred to as “class desensitization,” also exists. These researchers observed that two chemotactic receptors in human neutrophils, namely the receptors for fMet-Leu-Phe and C5a, which are both coupled to the Gi2 protein, are able to desensitize each other but that the α1-adrenergic receptor, which is coupled to a different G-protein (i.e. Gq), is not affected by pre-exposure to either fMet-Leu-Phe or C5a. Our experiments show that the FPR associates with the cytoskeleton not only when it is activated by its ligand but, more importantly, also when it is activated by another chemotactic stimulus, namely C5a. These findings are supported by the fact that the FPR also becomes associated with the cytoskeleton when the Gi2 protein is directly activated by GTPγS or AlF−4 in the absence of a ligand. Taken together, these results agree with the idea of class desensitization (Didsburyet al., 1991) and suggest that the FPR can be desensitized by other receptors at the G-protein level. Moreover, in the present study stimulation with C5a released the α-subunits of its transducing G-protein (i.e. Gi2 protein) from the cytoskeleton. This finding provides additional support to the hypothesis that cellular segregation of FPRs and Gi2 proteins is an essential part of the mechanism underlying the termination and/or desensitization of FPR signaling properties (Jesaitis et al., 12Jesaitis A.J. Tolley J.O. Bokoch G.M. Allen R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2783-2790Google Scholar; for review see 9Jesaitis A.J. Comments Mol. Cell Biophys. 1992; 8: 97-114Google Scholar). Furthermore, the previous observation that fMet-Leu-Phe-stimulation causes a selective release of Gi2α-subunits without affecting the association of Gsα-subunits to the cytoskeleton (Särndahl et al., 23Särndahl E. Bokoch G.M. Stendahl O. Andersson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6552-6556Google Scholar) provides at least a partial explanation for the selectivity of class desensitization that is indicated in the model proposed by Didsbury and co-workers (1991). We are much indebted to Susanne Thunholm and Pia Druid for expert technical assistance and Patricia Ödman for linguistic revision of the manuscript."

INTRODUCTIONChaperones are involved in (a) facilitating the maintenance of other polypeptides in the unfolded state, thus permitting their correct transmembrane targeting, intracellular folding, or oligomeric assembly; (b) the removal of denatured proteins after stress; and (c) the disassembly of several protein complexes (reviewed in 1Ellis R.J.

Chaperones appear to interact also with several hydrophilic or charged amino acids; SecB, DnaK, Hsc70, and BiP bind hydrophobic peptides with a variable preference for peptides including basic residues (12Flynn G.C. Pohl J. Flocco M.T. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1991; 353: 726-730Google Scholar, 13Gragerov A. Zeng L. Zhao X. Burkholder W. Gottesman M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 848-854Google Scholar, 14Hightower L.E.

Previous studies and the present results suggest that three types of peptides interact with chaperones70: (i) Hydrophobic peptides, (ii) amphiphilic peptides containing Arg/Lys, and (iii) Arg/Lys-rich peptides.Hydrophobic peptides can bind to chaperones70 without requiring the presence of Arg/Lys at an extremity; most of the peptides that bind to BiP contain hydrophobic and aromatic amino acids but are not enriched in hydrophilic amino acids, or only very little (12Flynn G.C. Pohl J. Flocco M.T. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1991; 353: 726-730Google Scholar, 15Blond-Elguindi S. Cwirla S.E. Dower W.J. Lipshutz R.J. Sprang S.R. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 717-728Google Scholar). Peptides enriched in internal hydrophobic residues are preferential DnaK substrates (13Gragerov A. Zeng L. Zhao X. Burkholder W. Gottesman M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 848-854Google Scholar), and the remarkable specificity of DnaK for hydrophobic amino acids (16Richarme G. Kohiyama M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24074-24077Google Scholar) demonstrates the importance of hydrophobic amino acid side chains for DnaK-protein interaction. In fact, the interaction of chaperones with hydrophobic sequences is probably the basis of their interaction with unfolded proteins (1Ellis R.J. Hemmingsen S.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 339-342Google Scholar, 2Georgopoulos C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 295-296Google Scholar, 3Hendrick J.P. Hartl F.U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 349-384Google Scholar, 17Shrake A.

Biol. 1971; 55: 379-400Google Scholar, 20Vitanen P.V. Gatenby A.A. Lorimer G.H. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 363-369Google Scholar).The presence of Arg/Lys at one extremity of a hydrophobic peptide is beneficial for its interaction with DnaK. Selection of peptides by DnaK from a peptide display library showed an enrichment in hydrophobic peptides containing Arg/Lys (13Gragerov A. Zeng L. Zhao X. Burkholder W. Gottesman M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 848-854Google Scholar). While this enrichment might reflect the influence of a neighboring negatively charged aspartate residue in the recombinant protein used for the display library, the specificity of Arg/Lys for DnaK has been confirmed by experiments with synthetic peptides (13Gragerov A. Zeng L. Zhao X. Burkholder W. Gottesman M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 848-854Google Scholar and this study). The existence of an arginine/lysine binding site and its cooperation with the hydrophobic sites of DnaK supports the hypothesis that these positively charged amino acids play a role in DnaK-peptide interaction. The interaction of DnaK with amphiphilic peptides containing Arg/Lys at one extremity could be implicated in the membrane targeting of signal sequences (34Von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 192: 287-290Google Scholar, 35Wild J. Altman E. Yura T. Gross C. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 1165-1172Google Scholar) or of membrane-spanning sequences, whose hydrophobic stretches are inserted into the membrane, while their positive N terminus remains on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane (21Dalbey R.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 253-257Google Scholar, 22Boyd D. Beckwith J. Cell. 1990; 62: 1031-1033Google Scholar). In protein folding and renaturation, interaction of chaperones70 with such amphiphilic bipartite sequences might allow the recognition of the interior/exterior boundary of soluble proteins, as previously suggested (13Gragerov A. Zeng L. Zhao X. Burkholder W. Gottesman M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 848-854Google Scholar, 14Hightower L.E. Sadis S.E. Takenaka I.M. The Biology of Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperones. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 179Google Scholar). The decrease by DnaJ of the interaction between DnaK and the hydrophobic part of these sequences (this study) would permit their release for membrane insertion (22Boyd D. Beckwith J. Cell. 1990; 62: 1031-1033Google Scholar, 34Von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 192: 287-290Google Scholar, 35Wild J. Altman E. Yura T. Gross C.

Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 363-369Google Scholar), or for transfer to the GroEL chaperone machine (30Langer T. Lu C. Echols H. Flanagan J. Hayer M.K. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1992; 356: 683-689Google Scholar).Arg/Lys-rich sequences seem to interact with chaperones70 without any need for neighboring hydrophobic amino acids. Hsc70 recognizes Arg/Lys-rich nuclear targeting sequences (14Hightower L.E. Sadis S.E. Takenaka I.M. The Biology of Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperones. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 179Google Scholar, 36Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Google Scholar). The present study shows that poly-Arg and poly-Lys interact strongly with DnaK, similarly to their interaction with the SecB chaperone (27Randall L.L. Science. 1992; 257: 241-255Google Scholar). It has been suggested that these positively charged residues interact with a negatively charged cluster in or near the peptide binding site of chaperones70 or with a negatively charged cluster near the C terminus of these chaperones (14Hightower L.E. Sadis S.E. Takenaka I.M. The Biology of Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperones. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 179Google Scholar). As for DnaK, it remains to be determined whether the binding of Arg/Lys-rich sequences is involved in a physiological function of the chaperone (such as a preferential interaction with DNA binding proteins, which contain such sequences).The cochaperone DnaJ attenuates the hydrophobic sites of DnaK but not its arginine/lysine site. The selective attenuation of the hydrophobic sites of DnaK by its cochaperone DnaJ might be important for protein folding and protein insertion into the membranes, as discussed above. This effect of DnaJ on DnaK is similar to that of the cochaperone GroES on GroEL (28de Crouy-Chanel A. El Yaagoubi A. Kohiyama M. Richarme G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10571-10575Google Scholar, 37Fenton W.A. Kashl Y. Furtak K. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1994; 371: 614-619Google Scholar), and the hydrophobic/hydrophilic flip flop of these chaperone machines might be important for their function. The cooperation between DnaK and DnaJ in polypeptide binding might depend on whether the polypeptide interacts with DnaK only or with both DnaK and DnaJ. It might also be conditioned by the mode of peptide binding to DnaK (hydrophobic, amphiphilic, hydrophilic). These different possibilities might explain the various effects of DnaJ and DnaJ-like proteins on hsp70-peptide interactions (30Langer T. Lu C. Echols H. Flanagan J. Hayer M.K. Hartl F.U.

INTRODUCTIONChaperones are involved in (a) facilitating the maintenance of other polypeptides in the unfolded state, thus permitting their correct transmembrane targeting, intracellular folding, or oligomeric assembly; (b) the removal of denatured proteins after stress; and (c) the disassembly of several protein complexes (reviewed in 1Ellis R.J. Hemmingsen S.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 339-342Google Scholar, 2Georgopoulos C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 295-296Google Scholar, 3Hendrick J.P. Hartl F.U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 349-384Google Scholar). One class of chaperones is formed by the 70-kDa heat shock proteins (hsp70), which includes the DnaK protein of Escherichia coli (4Liberek K. Skowyra D. Zylicz M. Johnson C. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14491-14496Google Scholar, 5Liberek K. Galitski T.P. Zylicz M. Georgopoulos C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3516-3520Google Scholar). DnaK is involved in protein folding, protein secretion, lambda phage replication, and regulation of the heat shock response (1Ellis R.J. Hemmingsen S.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 339-342Google Scholar, 2Georgopoulos C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 295-296Google Scholar, 3Hendrick J.P. Hartl F.U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 349-384Google Scholar). DnaK has also been implicated in cell division (6Bukau B. Walker G.C. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 2337-2346Google Scholar), murein synthesis (7Wu B. Georgopoulos C. Ang D. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5258-5264Google Scholar), flagellar assembly (8Shi W. Zhou J. Wild J. Adler J. Gross C.A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6256-6263Google Scholar), and osmoregulation (9Meury J. Kohiyama M. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4404-4410Google Scholar). Members of the hsp70 family can distinguish native proteins from their non-native forms (4Liberek K. Skowyra D. Zylicz M. Johnson C. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14491-14496Google Scholar, 10Palleros D.R. Welch W.J. Fink A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5719-5723Google Scholar), owing to the specificity of their peptide binding site. They reversibly bind unfolded proteins and peptides with concomitant ATP hydrolysis and display a peptide-dependent ATPase activity (4Liberek K. Skowyra D. Zylicz M. Johnson C. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14491-14496Google Scholar, 10Palleros D.R. Welch W.J. Fink A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5719-5723Google Scholar, 11Flynn G.C. Chappell T.G. Rothman J.E.

Several studies with BIP, DnaK, and Hsc70 have shown that chaperones70 interact specifically with peptides enriched in internal hydrophobic residues, with a preference for positively charged peptides (12Flynn G.C.

DnaK binds peptides containing hydrophobic residues and terminal positively charged residues (13Gragerov A. Zeng L. Zhao X. Burkholder W. Gottesman M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 848-854Google Scholar). Hsc70 binds peptides containing hydrophobic residues and basic amino acids, predominantly lysines (14Hightower L.E. Sadis S.E. Takenaka I.M. The Biology of Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperones. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 179Google Scholar). We have recently reported that DnaK interacts specifically with the aliphatic amino acids (Ile, Leu, Val, Ala) and the aromatic amino acids (Phe, Trp, Tyr) (16Richarme G. Kohiyama M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24074-24077Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that DnaK interacts specifically with the positively charged amino acids arginine and lysine, and we describe the effect of DnaJ on the hydrophobic sites and on the Arg/Lys binding sites of DnaK. The Arg/Lys binding site of DnaK possibly interacts with the polar head of hydrophobic sequences and may be involved in protein folding, protein renaturation (14Hightower L.E. Sadis S.E.

https://openalex.org/W2025021754,"The in vivo studies of transcriptional regulation by glucose, in general, have yielded ambiguous interpretations due to the closed loop relationship between insulin and glucose. Insulin cannot be held as a constant since elevated glucose levels will elicit a corresponding rise in insulin and current animal models of insulinopenia are associated with a plethora of counter-regulatory hormone responses. One potential solution to increase intracellular glucose flux without a further increase in insulin was achieved by transgenic overexpression of the insulin-sensitive glucose transporter, GLUT4, in specific skeletal muscles (previously described in Tsao, T.-S., Burcelin, R., Katz, E. B., Huang, L., and Charron, M. J. (1996) Diabetes 45, 28–36). Using these MLC-GLUT4 transgenic mice as a model, we investigated the effects of increased glucose flux on hexokinase II (HK II) gene expression in skeletal muscle. Under conditions where blood glucose levels were normal and insulin levels decreased by 36%, HK II mRNA level was reduced in non-GLUT4-overexpressing tissues (i.e. heart and adipose tissue) of 2–4-month-old male MLC-GLUT4 transgenic mice. This reduction in HK II mRNA was prevented in skeletal muscle, where overexpression of GLUT4 caused a 2.5-fold increase in basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. The levels of HK II mRNA in heart, muscle, and adipose tissue are paralleled by HK II enzymatic activity. In conclusion: 1) due to relative mild insulinopenia, HK II expression is decreased in non-GLUT4-overexpressing tissues of MLC-GLUT4 mice compared to age/sex-matched controls, and 2) GLUT4-mediated increase in cellular glucose flux can prevent the decrease in HK II expression (in GLUT4-overexpressing tissues) as a result of relative mild insulinopenia. Indeed, during the process of aging, the return of circulating insulin levels of MLC-GLUT4 mice to normal levels is associated with the normalization of HK II expression in all tissues of MLC-GLUT4 and age/sex-matched control mice. We propose that: 1) glucose flux has an amplifying effect on the ability of insulin to stimulate skeletal muscle HK II gene expression and 2) insulin-dependent glucose flux may be a potential mechanism by which HK II gene expression is regulated by sensitivity to insulin.

https://openalex.org/W1992640460,"We reported previously that a 116-kDa lipoprotein lipase (LPL)-binding protein from endothelial cells has sequence homology to the amino-terminal region of apolipoprotein (apo) B. We now tested whether endothelial cells synthesize apoB mRNA and protein. Primers were designed to the human apoB cDNA sequence and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was performed using total RNA isolated from bovine and human endothelial cells. With primers to the 5′ region of the apoB mRNA (amino-terminal region of apoB protein) expected size PCR products were generated from both bovine and human endothelial cells as well as from mouse liver RNA, which was used as a control. Primers designed to the 3′ region of apoB mRNA generated PCR products from human endothelial cells and HepG2 cells but not from bovine or mouse cells. These data suggest that endothelial cells contain full-length apoB mRNA and that the 5′ or the amino-terminal region of apoB is highly conserved from mouse to human. This was confirmed by direct sequencing of the mouse and bovine PCR products. To test whether apoB protein was produced, bovine endothelial cell proteins were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine or [3H]leucine and immunoprecipitated with anti-human apoB antibodies. Using extracts from cells labeled for 1 h, monoclonal antibody 47, directed to the low density lipoprotein receptor binding region of apoB, precipitated a protein of approximate molecular mass 550,000, the size of full-length apoB. Immunoprecipitation of the 550-kDa protein was abolished in the presence of added unlabeled low density lipoprotein. From cells labeled for 16 h, a 116-kDa protein was immunoprecipitated by polyclonal anti-apoB antibodies. This protein was partly released from cells by heparin treatment. Pulse-chase analysis showed that the 116-kDa fragment appeared at the same time as the full-length apoB began disappearing. The immunoprecipitated 116-kDa fragment also bound labeled LPL on ligand blot, further suggesting that it is an amino-terminal fragment of apoB. Incubation of endothelial cells with oleic acid (0.25 and 0.5 mM) did not significantly alter the production of either the full-length apoB or the 116-kDa fragment. These data show that endothelial cells synthesize apoB. The full-length apoB appears to be cleaved to form a 116-kDa fragment that can function as a LPL-binding protein.

The amino-terminal region of apoB is the relatively hydrophilic part of apoB. It contains six cystine disulfide bridges making it highly globular (1Young S.G. Circulation. 1990; 82: 1574-1594Google Scholar, 2Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25621-25624Google Scholar). Models of apoB suggest that this region of apoB extends away from the lipid core of LDL (7Yang C. Gu Z. Weng S. Kim T.W. Chen S. Pownall H.J. Sharp P.M. Liu S. Li W. Gotto A.M. Chan L.

Although the amino-terminal, but not the COOH-terminal, region of apoB is preserved in the two circulating forms of apoB, apoB-100 in VLDL and LDL, and apoB-48 in chylomicrons, no function has been attributed to this region. Previous studies from our laboratory showed that lipoprotein lipase (LPL) binds to the amino-terminal region of apoB (9Sivaram P. Choi S.Y. Curtiss L.K. Goldberg I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9409-9412Google Scholar, 10Choi S.Y. Sivaram P. Walker D. Curtiss L.K. Gretch D.G. Sturley S.L. Attie A.D. Deckelbaum R.J. Goldberg I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8081-8086Google Scholar). A 116-kDa LPL-binding protein isolated from bovine aortic endothelial cells had sequence homology with regions near the amino terminus of apoB (9Sivaram P. Choi S.Y. Curtiss L.K. Goldberg I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9409-9412Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) that recognize the amino-terminal, but not the carboxyl-terminal, region of apoB inhibited LPL binding to endothelial cells (9Sivaram P. Choi S.Y. Curtiss L.K. Goldberg I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9409-9412Google Scholar). Thus, we postulated that LPL binding to endothelial cells may involve two molecular interactions, the well known LPL association with heparan sulfate proteoglycans (11Cheng C.F. Oosta G.M. Bensadoun A. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12893-12898Google Scholar, 12Shimada K. Gill P.J. Silbert J.E. Douglas W.H. Fanburg B.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1981; 68: 995-1002Google Scholar, 13Stins M.F. Sivaram P. Sasaki A. Goldberg I.J. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1853-1861Google Scholar) and a second protein-protein interaction between LPL and apoB (9Sivaram P. Choi S.Y. Curtiss L.K. Goldberg I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9409-9412Google Scholar). The origin of the 116-kDa apoB fragment found on cultured endothelial cells was uncertain. It might have been synthesized by the endothelial cells, or it could have originated in the culture medium. ApoB is extremely susceptible to proteolysis and lipid-free amino-terminal fragments of apoB have been found in serum (14Cardin A.D. Witt K.R. Chao J. Margolius H.S. Donaldson V.H. Jackson R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8522-8528Google Scholar, 15Byrne R.E. Scanu A.M. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 109-120Google Scholar). Much of the apoB-100 that is synthesized by cells undergoes intracellular degradation (16Dixon J.L. Ginsberg H.N. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 34167-34179Google Scholar). However, a 85-kDa amino-terminal apoB fragment escapes intracellular degradation and is secreted by the human liver cell line HepG2 (17Thrift R.N. Drisko J. Dueland S. Trawick J.D. Davis R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9161-9165Google Scholar, 18Sallach S.M. Adeli K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1265: 29-32Google Scholar). Although full-length apoB is degraded by apoB transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells, these cells will secrete amino-terminal apoB fragments (19Du E. Kurth J. Wang S.-L. Humiston P. Davis R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24169-24176Google Scholar). Conceivably, the liver or other organs could synthesize fragments of apoB that circulate in the plasma and then attach to the luminal endothelial surface. Alternatively, apoB fragments could be synthesized by endothelial cells. The experiments described here provide evidence that cultured endothelial cells produce both a full-length and an amino-terminal fragment of apoB. Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) were isolated and cultured as described (20Sivaram P. Klein M.G. Goldberg I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16517-16522Google Scholar). The cells (5–15 passages) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Human aortic endothelial cells (HEC, passage 3) were purchased from Clonetics Corp. (San Diego, CA) and were cultured in endothelial cell growth medium (catalog number CC-3024, Clonetics) containing 2% fetal bovine serum, 10 ng/ml human epidermal growth factor, and 12 µg/ml of bovine brain extract. These cells were positive for factor VIII (von Willebrand's) antigen and uptake of di-acetylated LDL, endothelial cell markers. The following primers were designed (Designer-PCR software, Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL) based on the human apoB sequence (21Cladaras C. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Nolte R.T. Atkinson D. Zannis V.I. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 3495-3507Google Scholar). Downstream (DS) primers were used in the reverse transcription reaction and DS together with upstream (US) primers were used in the PCR reaction: US1 (nucleotides (nt) 249–268), 5′ CCC GAT TCA AGC ACC TCC G 3′; DS1 (complementary to nucleotides 441–422), 5′ CAG GGT TGA AGC CAT ACA C 3′; DS2 (complementary to nucleotides 883–864), 5′ GCT TCC TCT TAG CGT CCA G 3′; US2 (nucleotides 12,355-12,372), 5′ GGG TCC TTT ATG ATT ATG T 3′; DS3 (complementary to nucleotides 12,735-12,716), 5′ CGG AAA CTG GAA TCT GGG G 3′. RNA from confluent monolayers of endothelial cells was isolated using total RNA isolation reagent (TRISOLV, Biotecx, Houston, TX) according to manufacturer's instructions. PCR primers for human apoB cDNA were synthesized by National Biosciences (Plymouth, MN). RT-PCR was performed using GeneAmp RNA PCR kit from Perkin-Elmer (Rosche Laboratories, Branchburg, NJ). Amplification was carried out for 30 cycles, and PCR products were analyzed by 2% agarose gels (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 6.3Google Scholar). For PCR at the amino-terminal region (5′ of mRNA), primers US1 and DS1 were used. The expected product size is 193 bp. For PCR near the carboxyl terminus (3′-terminus), primers US2 and DS3 were used that would give a PCR product of 381 bp. Double-stranded sequencing of PCR products was performed using Applied Biosystems automated sequencing apparatus (Sequetech Corp., Mountain View, CA). A 1-kilobase fragment of apoB (representing approximately 7% of the amino terminus of apoB) was generated from a pCMV5-apoB plasmid (gift of Dr. Z. Yao) (22Yao Z. Blackert B.D. Linton M.F. Taylor S.M. Young S.G. McCarthy B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3300-3308Google Scholar) by StuI/NotI digestion. The fragment was 32P-labeled by the random prime labeling procedure (Boehringer Mannheim) according to manufacturer's instructions. 32P-Labeled apoB cDNA was used to screen a λgt11 bovine intestine cDNA library. Positive clones were isolated and DNA from viral supernatants was prepared by standard protocols (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 6.3Google Scholar). PCR of bovine apoB was performed using primers US1 and DS2. The expected product size is 635 bp. DS2 was designed such that sequence for a larger part of apoB at the amino-terminal region could be obtained. Rabbit anti-human apoB polyclonal antibody was kindly provided by Drs. X. Wu and H. Ginsberg of this department. Monoclonal anti-human apoB antibody, mAb47, was provided by Dr. L. Curtiss (Scripps Research Institute, CA). mAb47 has epitopes at the receptor binding domain of human apoB (24Young S.G. Witzum J.L. Casal D.C. Curtiss L.K. Bernstein S. Arteriosclerosis. 1986; 6: 178-188Google Scholar) and also binds to bovine LDL (9Sivaram P. Choi S.Y. Curtiss L.K. Goldberg I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9409-9412Google Scholar). Confluent monolayers of endothelial cells were incubated either with [35S]methionine/cysteine mixture (Translabel™) or with [3H]leucine (Amersham Corp.). Following labeling, media were collected and cells were lysed in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.25 M sucrose, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 50 µg/ml each of leupeptin and pepstatin and 0.5 mM PMSF (lysis buffer) for 6 h at 4°C. Cell lysates were centrifuged for 20 min at 14,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge, and the supernatants were used for immunoprecipitation. In some experiments following labeling, cells were washed with PBS containing 10 units/ml of heparin prior to lysis of cells. Proteins in the medium, cell lysates, and heparin-released fractions were immunoprecipitated with anti-apoB antibodies (25Dixon J.L. Furukawa S. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5080-5086Google Scholar) and analyzed by 3–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (9Sivaram P. Choi S.Y. Curtiss L.K. Goldberg I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9409-9412Google Scholar). Gels were immersed in Autofluor (National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA) for 1 h, dried, and autoradiographed. Biotinylation of LPL and ligand blotting were performed as described previously (9Sivaram P. Choi S.Y. Curtiss L.K. Goldberg I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9409-9412Google Scholar, 26Sivaram P. Wadhwani S.W. Klein M.G. Sasaki A. Goldberg I.J. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 214: 511-516Google Scholar). We tested whether endothelial cells express apoB message by performing RT-PCR. Primers to the 5′ region of apoB that are complementary to nucleotides 249–268 in exon 3 and nucleotides 422–441 in exon 4 were used. Because these primers span an intron, a different size product will be generated from any DNA contamination. RT-PCR of total RNA from BAEC and HEC resulted in the generation of the expected 193-bp PCR product (Fig. 1A). Human liver cell line HepG2 RNA and mouse liver RNA were used as positive controls. In addition to the 193-bp product, some lower molecular mass products were also observed in PCR reactions from BAEC and HEC. Southern blotting with labeled HepG2 PCR product showed binding with only the 193-bp product from BAEC (not shown). These results show that endothelial cells express apoB mRNA. Yeast RNA did not produce the PCR product and no products were generated from endothelial cell RNA when reverse transcriptase was omitted in the reaction (not shown). We then tested whether a full-length apoB mRNA is expressed by these cells. Primers to nucleotides (12,355-12,372 and 12,735-12,716) in the 3′ region of human apoB were used. Using these primers expected size PCR products (381 bp) were generated only from HEC and HepG2 cells (Fig. 1B). No PCR products were generated from BAEC or mouse liver RNA. No PCR products were generated from HEC RNA when reverse transcriptase was omitted from the reaction (HEC without RT). These results suggest that HEC express a full-length apoB mRNA. The primers designed to human apoB mRNA did not react with bovine and mouse mRNA sequences. Thus, the 5′-terminal region of apoB mRNA (amino-terminal region of apoB) appears to be more conserved from mouse to human than the 3′ or carboxyl-terminal region. Alternative possibilities, although less likely, are that BAEC synthesize only the 5′-terminal part of the apoB or that another protein with homology to the 5′-terminal region of apoB is synthesized by bovine endothelial cells. To further confirm that the amino-terminal region of apoB is highly conserved, PCR products from bovine endothelial cells and mouse liver were sequenced and compared with human apoB sequence. Bovine apoB showed a 92–94% nucleotide and amino acid homology in this amino-terminal region, and mouse apoB was 80–85% homologous, suggesting that this region of apoB is very highly conserved. PCR products from another bovine source, bovine intestine library, were also sequenced. The sequence showed a 88–90% homology for the region of nucleotide 460 to nucleotide 860, strongly suggesting that it is a highly conserved region. In our previous studies we used BAEC to characterize LPL binding to cells and to identify the 116-kDa apoB like LPL-binding protein. We therefore used BAEC in the following experiments to examine whether full-length apoB and a 116-kDa apoB fragment are synthesized by these cells. Because apoB is rapidly degraded in several cell lines, we initially used short labeling times that would allow us to precipitate an apoB size protein (Fig. 2A). Cells were labeled for 1 h, and cell extracts were immunoprecipitated by either polyclonal apoB antibody or mAb47. A protein of the size of full-length apoB was immunoprecipitated by mAb47. The immunoprecipitation of this large apoB size protein was competed when unlabeled LDL was used in the reaction (mAb47 + LDL). No smaller size products were precipitated by mAb47. Polyclonal antibody did not precipitate either a full-length or a 116-kDa fragment of apoB from 1-h labeled cells (not shown). These data suggest that endothelial cells produce full-length apoB. Our previous results showed the presence of a labeled 116-kDa LPL-binding protein in cells incubated overnight with [35S]methionine (20Sivaram P. Klein M.G. Goldberg I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16517-16522Google Scholar). To determine whether a 116-kDa apoB fragment was synthesized by cells, BAEC were labeled for 16 h with [35S]methionine, and proteins were immunoprecipitated with polyclonal apoB antibodies. ApoB antibodies precipitated a 116-kDa protein in both the heparin-released fraction (HR) and cell extracts (Fig. 2B). This band was not found when immunoprecipitation was performed in the presence of excess unlabeled LDL (HR + LDL). This suggested that the 116-kDa protein was a fragment of apoB. As has been described by others (25Dixon J.L. Furukawa S. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5080-5086Google Scholar), we occasionally observed a fragment of molecular mass ∼250 kDa that was precipitated by nonspecific antibodies and was not competed by LDL (not shown). We showed previously that LPL binds to amino-terminal, but not COOH-terminal, fragments of apoB (9Sivaram P. Choi S.Y. Curtiss L.K. Goldberg I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9409-9412Google Scholar, 10Choi S.Y. Sivaram P. Walker D. Curtiss L.K. Gretch D.G. Sturley S.L. Attie A.D. Deckelbaum R.J. Goldberg I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8081-8086Google Scholar). To confirm that the 116-kDa fragment was an amino-terminal fragment of apoB, we performed ligand blotting with biotinylated LPL (9Sivaram P. Choi S.Y. Curtiss L.K. Goldberg I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9409-9412Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates obtained from polyclonal apoB antibodies were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose (Fig. 2C). In this figure the nonspecific 250-kDa protein is also seen. Biotinylated LPL bound to the 116-kDa fragment precipitated by polyclonal apoB antibodies, suggesting that the 116-kDa apoB is an amino-terminal fragment. To determine if the 116-kDa fragment of apoB arises by proteolytic cleavage of full-length apoB, we carried out pulse-chase experiments. Cells were labeled with [3H]leucine for 1 h and chased for up to 2 h in the absence of label. Immunoprecipitations were performed with both mAb47 to identify full-length apoB (B-100) and with polyclonal apoB antibodies to identify the 116-kDa fragment (Fig. 3). A 550-kDa band was immunoprecipitated by mAb47 in the 1-h labeled cells. In up to 1 h of chase, no significant loss in the intensity of this band was observed. In 2 h, however, the intensity decreased significantly. In proteins precipitated with the polyclonal antibody, a 116-kDa protein was evident at 2 h, but not earlier. Therefore, as the apoB-100 size band decreased, the 116-kDa protein became evident. These data suggest that the 116-kDa protein arises from proteolysis of apoB-100. Studies in HepG2 cells showed that incubation with oleic acid resulted in decreased degradation and increased secretion of apoB in lipoprotein particles (25Dixon J.L. Furukawa S. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5080-5086Google Scholar, 27Bostrom K. Boren J. Wettesten M. Sjoberg A. Bondjers G. Wilkund O. Carlsson P. Olofsson S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4434-4442Google Scholar, 28Pullinger G.R. North J.D. Teng B.B. Rifici V.A. Ronhild de Brito A.E. Scott J. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 1065-1077Google Scholar). In endothelial cells no detectable apoB was found either in the total medium or in a lipoprotein (d < 1.21) fraction (not shown). We next tested whether oleic acid will affect apoB production by endothelial cells. Cells were incubated with 0.25 and 0.5 mM oleic acid for 30 min, and cells were then labeled with [3H]leucine for 1 or 4 h. Media and cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with polyclonal apoB antibodies or mAb47. The intensity of the 116-kDa apoB was not significantly affected by treatment with oleic acid in 4-h labeled cells (Fig. 4, polyclonal, lanes 6 and 8). No apoB, full-length or 116 kDa, was observed in the medium of control and oleic acid-treated cells (lanes 4, 5, 7, and 9). Similarly in 1-h labeled cells full-length apoB was not significantly different in control and oleic acid-treated cells (lanes 1–3). These results suggest that endothelial apoB production is not regulated by oleic acid. Since the major function for apoB is assembly of lipoproteins, it is generally assumed that cells that do not make lipoproteins do not synthesize apoB. However, other investigators have found apoB mRNA and protein in tissues other than liver and intestine (29Blue M.L. Protter A.A. Williams D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10048-10051Google Scholar, 30Demmer L.A. Levin M.S. Elovson J. Reuben M.A. Lusis A.J. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8102-8106Google Scholar). Our interest in apoB stems from the observation that cultured BAEC contained a 116-kDa amino-terminal fragment of apoB (9Sivaram P. Choi S.Y. Curtiss L.K. Goldberg I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9409-9412Google Scholar). Initial experiments to detect apoB mRNA by Northern blotting were not successful (not shown). We then used the more sensitive PCR, using primers designed to the 5′ region of human apoB mRNA. Much to our surprise we obtained PCR products from total RNA of endothelial cells. With 2 µg of total RNA, PCR products from endothelial cells could be generated in 20 cycles compared with 15 cycles for HepG2 RNA. Although BAEC often produced an easily visible PCR product, occasional batches of cells were negative. We suspect that this was because some BAEC lost the ability to synthesize apoB due to repetitive passage or, perhaps, other factors related to their culture conditions. PCR using primers to the 5′ region was positive across species, from human to cow to mouse. When the 5′ region of apoB was sequenced from the PCR products and from bovine intestinal library, the degree of interspecies homology was quite striking. We were surprised at the extent of conservation in the amino-terminal region, 90–95% between human and bovine and 80–85% between mouse and human both at nucleotide and amino acid levels. Previous studies by Matsumoto et al. (31Matsumoto A. Aburatani H. Shibasaki Y. Kodama T. Takaku F. Itakura H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 142: 92-99Google Scholar) showed that rat apoB was 83% homologous to human apoB in the region comprising amino acids 138–522. Such conservation during evolution suggests that the region near the amino terminus has an important function. High interspecies homology has been reported for two other regions of apoB. The LDL receptor binding domain (nucleotides 9623-10,442) is highly conserved. This region has a 75% homology at the nucleotide level between mouse and human and 79.9% between human and pig (32Law A. Scott J. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 1109-1120Google Scholar). The mRNA editing region of apoB (nucleotides 6640-6720) is also highly conserved. Homology in this region varies from 88 to 93% among different species and humans (33Greeve J. Altkemper I. Dieterich J-H. Greten H. Windler E. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1367-1383Google Scholar). In our studies, using the primers to the 3′ terminal region of human apoB mRNA, PCR was only positive with HepG2 and HEC. Thus, the primers chosen for the 3′ terminal reaction were species specific. However, these data suggested that endothelial cells contain full length apoB mRNA. Not only do endothelial cells contain apoB mRNA, but they also synthesize apoB protein. Full length apoB was precipitated from labeled BAEC using mAb47. This immunoprecipitated band was found with short-term labeling of the cells. Longer chase times decreased the amount of full-length apoB, suggesting that this protein was degraded or converted to proteolytic fragments. One of these, a fragment of 116 kDa, was found with longer labeling. Our pulse-chase data suggest that the 116 kDa protein comes from apoB-100. The 116 kDa band was most evident as the larger full-length apoB band decreased in intensity. Although we attempted to block proteolysis with N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal, the cysteine protease inhibitor used in HepG2 cells (16Dixon J.L. Ginsberg H.N. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 34167-34179Google Scholar, 34Sakata N. Wu X. Dixon J.L. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22967-22970Google Scholar), these experiments were unsuccessful. Lower concentrations of ALLN had no effect on the cells, while higher concentrations (e.g. 40 µg/ml used in other studies) were toxic to the endothelial cells. Therefore, the site and the events leading to the apoB proteolysis are not clear. Although a full-length apoB was produced in the cells, no detectable amount was secreted into the medium. This may be due to lack of machinery in endothelial cells for lipoprotein assembly and secretion. Immunoblot analysis of total microsomes isolated from and human and bovine endothelial cells showed no detectable microsomal triglyceride transfer protein, a necessary component in the secretion of apoB lipoproteins by liver and intestine (35Wetterau J.R. Aggerback L.P. Bouma M.E. Eisenberg C. Munck A. Hermiern A. Schmitz J. Gay G. Rader D.J. Gregg R.E. Science. 1992; 258: 999-1001Google Scholar). Thus lipoprotein production does not appear to be the purpose of apoB production by endothelial cells. This may be the reason why oleic acid had no effect on the production of endothelial apoB. HepG2 cells secrete a smaller, 85-kDa apoB proteolytic fragment (19Du E. Kurth J. Wang S.-L. Humiston P. Davis R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24169-24176Google Scholar). Other proteolytic fragments, including one that is approximately 116 kDa, are also found in these cells. These proteins, however, are less abundant than the 85-kDa protein. Differences either in the apoB (bovine versus human) or in cells (HepG2 versus endothelial) might be responsible for the generation of different size apoB fragments. In this regard, a recent study reported that human endothelial cells contain both 116- and 85-kDa LPL-binding proteins (36Wolle J. Ferguson E. Devall L.J. Newton R.J. Saxena U. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 906-912Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that human and bovine endothelial cells process apoB differently. In our experiments mAb47, but not polyclonal antibodies, precipitated full-length apoB. The same polyclonal antibodies, however, precipitated full-length apoB from HepG2 cells (not shown). This may be a reason why no full-length apoB was precipitated in our 16-h labeling experiments (Fig. 2B). The inability of the polyclonal antibody to precipitate bovine full-length apoB could be because the polyclonal antibodies contain subspecies of antibodies that recognize several epitopes in the human apoB that may not have been conserved in the bovine apoB. In addition, the 116-kDa protein could have competed for those epitopes in the amino-terminal region of apoB that are conserved, making the polyclonal antibodies less likely to work well in immunoprecipitating bovine full-length apoB. The 116-kDa protein was released from the cells by treatment with heparin. This suggests that the protein is on the cell surface and, therefore, able to interact with LPL. Moreover, it suggests that this apoB fragment is either associated with proteoglycans or is attached to the cells via an ionic interaction. Some 116-kDa protein was not heparin-releasable. This could occur if the carboxyl end of the molecule is relatively hydrophobic and inserted into the membrane. Alternatively, the heparin treatment might have been only partially effective in removing the cell surface 116-kDa protein, or the non-heparin-sensitive 116-kDa protein may be intracellular. Based on our observations, several models for LPL association with the endothelial cell surface can be proposed (Fig. 5). LPL can either directly interact with cell surface HSPG (model 1) or a cell surface amino-terminal fragment of apoB (models 2 and 3). Alternatively, LPL can bind to both HSPG and apoB protein (models 4 and 5). We predict and have shown (37Ling P. Sivaram P. Goldberg I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 261 (in press)Google Scholar) that this double attachment enhances the stability of the LPL association with cells. LPL association with the endothelial cell surface is in constant competition with other heparin-binding proteins. Hence, a cooperative binding involving both HSPG and a 116-kDa apoB fragment could improve LPL's chances of staying on the surface and hydrolyzing lipoprotein-triglyceride in the most efficient way."
https://openalex.org/W2080810690,"The hematopoietic cytokine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) mediates its activity through binding to cell surface receptors. The receptor for GM-CSF belongs to a superfamily of cytokine receptors characterized by a conserved extracellular motif. The high affinity GM-CSF receptor (GMR) consists of two transmembrane anchored subunits; a ligand binding α subunit (transmembrane GMRα) and a signal transducing β subunit (GMRβ), both of which belong to the cytokine receptor superfamily. The human GM-CSF receptor α subunit also exists in a soluble form (solGMRα), which antagonizes GM-CSF activity in vitro. We directly tested the potential for solGMRα to interact with GMRβ in vitro. Our experiments demonstrated that exogenous solGMRα, even in the presence of GM-CSF, does not interact with GMRβ on the cell surface. However, when solGMRα and GMRβ are co-expressed in baby hamster kidney cells, solGMRα is retained on the cell surface and forms a functional intermediate affinity GM-CSF binding complex (Kd = 331 pM). In addition, the cell surface expression of solGMRα is independent of the presence of GM-CSF as demonstrated using flow cytometry. Cells expressing only solGMRα do not show cell surface retention or form functional GM-CSF cell surface binding complexes. Sequencing of our GMRβ clone revealed a nucleotide substitution (A → C) resulting in the substitution of Ala for Glu at position 9 from the amino terminus of the mature GMRβ peptide. Because the GMRβ (A → C) clone is capable of forming functional high affinity receptors with transmembrane GMRα (Kd = 64 pM), we feel that the cell surface retention of solGMRα is independent of the GMRβ mutation. We suggest that the co-expression and interaction of solGMRα and GMRβ represents a previously unrecognized GM-CSF receptor complex and a novel, ligand-independent mechanism of cytokine receptor assembly. The hematopoietic cytokine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) mediates its activity through binding to cell surface receptors. The receptor for GM-CSF belongs to a superfamily of cytokine receptors characterized by a conserved extracellular motif. The high affinity GM-CSF receptor (GMR) consists of two transmembrane anchored subunits; a ligand binding α subunit (transmembrane GMRα) and a signal transducing β subunit (GMRβ), both of which belong to the cytokine receptor superfamily. The human GM-CSF receptor α subunit also exists in a soluble form (solGMRα), which antagonizes GM-CSF activity in vitro. We directly tested the potential for solGMRα to interact with GMRβ in vitro. Our experiments demonstrated that exogenous solGMRα, even in the presence of GM-CSF, does not interact with GMRβ on the cell surface. However, when solGMRα and GMRβ are co-expressed in baby hamster kidney cells, solGMRα is retained on the cell surface and forms a functional intermediate affinity GM-CSF binding complex (Kd = 331 pM). In addition, the cell surface expression of solGMRα is independent of the presence of GM-CSF as demonstrated using flow cytometry. Cells expressing only solGMRα do not show cell surface retention or form functional GM-CSF cell surface binding complexes. Sequencing of our GMRβ clone revealed a nucleotide substitution (A → C) resulting in the substitution of Ala for Glu at position 9 from the amino terminus of the mature GMRβ peptide. Because the GMRβ (A → C) clone is capable of forming functional high affinity receptors with transmembrane GMRα (Kd = 64 pM), we feel that the cell surface retention of solGMRα is independent of the GMRβ mutation. We suggest that the co-expression and interaction of solGMRα and GMRβ represents a previously unrecognized GM-CSF receptor complex and a novel, ligand-independent mechanism of cytokine receptor assembly.

GM-CSF stimulates these activities through its interaction with a highly specific receptor expressed in low numbers on the surface of responding cells (6Nicola N.A. Immunol.

The receptor for GM-CSF belongs to a cytokine receptor superfamily characterized by conserved extracellular structures (8Bazan J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6934-6938Google Scholar). In addition to conservation of structure, the cytokine receptor superfamily also exhibits several trends. The cell surface receptors are multisubunit complexes with most being composed of a ligand-specific α subunit and a nonligand binding β subunit that is responsible for providing the receptor complex with signal transduction capabilities. As well, many of the cytokines that have overlapping functions share subunits among their receptor complexes. For example, the receptors for IL-3, IL-5, and GM-CSF each contain a ligand specific α subunit exhibiting low affinity binding; however, all three utilize a common β subunit to convert the receptor to a high affinity binding complex and to initiate signal transduction (reviewed in 9Miyajima A. Mui A.L.-F. Ogorochi T. Sakamaki K. Blood. 1993; 82: 1960-1974Google Scholar). Another common feature of many cytokine receptors is the formation of soluble isoforms (reviewed in 10Heaney M.L. Golde D.W. Blood. 1996; 87: 847-857Google Scholar). These have been described for many receptors including those that bind granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, GM-CSF, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, ciliary neurotropic factor (CNTF), and erythropoietin. Although the generation of soluble isoforms is common for many cytokine receptors, the mechanism used to generate them varies. They include alternative splicing of RNA transcripts, proteolytic cleavage of extracellular domains, and cleavage of glycosyl-phosphatidyl-inositol membrane anchors. Several of these soluble cytokine receptors have been detected in human body fluids in both physiological and pathological conditions, suggesting that these soluble isoforms have a physiological role. Several functions have been proposed for soluble receptors ranging from ligand protection and transport to conferring new cytokine responsiveness to cells or antagonizing the activities of the cytokines. The receptor for GM-CSF is a cell surface membrane-spanning heterodimer. The α subunit (tmGMRα) is ligand-specific and binds GM-CSF with low affinity (Kd = 2–8 nM) (11Gearing D.P. King J.A. Gough N.M. Nicola N.A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3667-3676Google Scholar). The β subunit (GMRβ) is incapable of binding GM-CSF on its own, but in conjunction with GMRα, GMRβ forms a high affinity binding complex (Kd = 50–100 pM) (12Kitamura T. Sato N. Arai K. Miyajima A. Cell. 1991; 66: 1165-1174Google Scholar, 13Hayashida K. Kitamura T. Gorman D.M. Arai K.-I. Yokota T. Miyajima A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9655-9659Google Scholar, 14Chiba S.

Larsen A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4295-4299Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that the α and β subunits can only be co-immunoprecipitated in the presence of GM-CSF (16Eder M. Ernst T.J. Ganser A. Jubinsky P.T. Inhorn R. Hoelzer D. Griffin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30173-30180Google Scholar). It is likely that in the absence of GM-CSF, GMRα and GMRβ remain as separate but perhaps spatially close molecules on the cell surface and GM-CSF induces GMRα and GMRβ interaction to form a receptor complex. Current evidence suggests that the β subunit can transduce signals; however, controversy remains over the GMRα subunit's role in signaling (17Kitamura T. Hayashida K. Sakamaki K. Yokota T. Arai K.

Blood. 1993; 82: 3298-3306Google Scholar). The α subunit of the GM-CSF receptor exists in both transmembrane (tmGMRα) and soluble forms (solGMRα). Examination of the genomic structure of the GMRα gene reveals that exon 11 encodes the transmembrane domain and alternative splicing of this exon would result in a 97-nucleotide deletion (23Nakagawa Y. Kosugi H. Miyajima A. Arai K. Yokota T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10905-10912Google Scholar); the precise sequence deleted in the solGMRα cDNA (24Ashworth A. Kraft A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 7178Google Scholar, 25Raines M.A. Liu L. Quan S.G. Joe V. DiPersio J.F. Golde D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8203-8207Google Scholar, 26Crosier K.E. Wong G.G. Mathey-Prevot B. Nathan D.G. Sieff C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7744-7748Google Scholar). This deletion also causes a frameshift that results in premature termination of translation and the formation of a unique 16-amino acid carboxyl-terminal tail. The RNA message for solGMRα has been demonstrated in unfractionated bone marrow, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, T-lymphocytes, and fibroblasts from the synovial tissue of rheumatoid arthritis patients and unfractionated synovial tissue from osteoarthritis patients (27Williams W.V. VonFeldt J.M. Rosenbaum H. Ugen K.E. Weiner D.B. Arthritis Rheum. 1994; 37: 1468-1478Google Scholar) as well as several human myeloid leukemic cell lines (28Heaney M.L. Vera J.C. Raines M.A. Golde D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2365-2369Google Scholar); however, the protein has yet to be detected in vivo. Several groups have cloned the cDNA for solGMRα (24Ashworth A. Kraft A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 7178Google Scholar, 25Raines M.A. Liu L. Quan S.G. Joe V. DiPersio J.F. Golde D.W. Proc. Natl.

Recombinant solGMRα is a 55–60-kDa glycoprotein that binds to GM-CSF in solution and antagonizes the activity of GM-CSF when added exogenously to assays of GM-CSF biological activity (27Williams W.V. VonFeldt J.M. Rosenbaum H. Ugen K.E. Weiner D.B. Arthritis Rheum. 1994; 37: 1468-1478Google Scholar, 29Brown C.B. Beaudry P. Dickinson-Laing T. Shoemaker S. Kaushansky K. Blood. 1995; 85: 1488-1495Google Scholar). The data suggest a mechanism of antagonism whereby solGMRα binds GM-CSF in solution and functions by keeping the ligand away from its cell surface receptors, indicating that exogenous solGMRα does not interact with GMRβ. In this paper, we describe studies directly testing the potential for solGMRα to interact with GMRβ in the presence or the absence of GM-CSF in vitro. We demonstrate that solGMRα added exogenously to BHK cells expressing GMRβ does not form a cell surface complex with GMRβ; however, co-expression of solGMRα and GMRβ leads to retention of solGMRα on the cell surface and the formation of a functional GM-CSF binding complex. In addition, the cell surface expression of solGMRα is independent of the presence of GM-CSF. The cloning of human tmGMRα and solGMRα and the establishment of stable BHK cell lines overexpressing tmGMRα or solGMRα has been previously described (29Brown C.B. Beaudry P. Dickinson-Laing T. Shoemaker S. Kaushansky K. Blood. 1995; 85: 1488-1495Google Scholar). The human GMRβ cDNA (gift of Dr. K. Kaushansky, University of Washington) was cloned into the mammalian expression vector pDx (Zymogenetics Inc., Seattle, WA) to produce pDGMRβ. Sequencing of this clone revealed the presence of a single nucleotide substitution (A → C) resulting in a substitution of Ala for Glu at amino acid position 9 of the mature GMRβ peptide (13Hayashida K. Kitamura T. Gorman D.M. Arai K.-I. Yokota T. Miyajima A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9655-9659Google Scholar). pDGMRβ was co-transfected into BHK cells with a vector bearing the dihydrofolate reductase gene (pZEM229R, Zymogenetics Inc., confers methotrexate resistance) to establish GMRβ-expressing lines. In addition, pDGMRβ was co-transfected with a vector containing the cDNA for tmGMRα (pDtmGMRα) and pZEM229R or pZEM229RsolGMRα. Transfections were performed using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (30Minty A. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 2125-2136Google Scholar). Clonal cell lines expressing GMRβ or GMRβ and GMRα were established by selection in 500 µM methotrexate (David Bull Laboratories Pty. Ltd., Mulgrave, Victoria, Australia). Colonies were screened for the cell surface expression of GMRβ by fluorescence-activated cell sorting using a mouse anti-human GMRβ monoclonal antibody (3D7, gift of Dr. A. Lopez, Adelaide, Australia). BHK cells co-transfected with the cDNA for solGMRα and GMRβ were grown for 2 months before being sorted for GMRα expression using flow cytometry. Stable cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium, 10% fetal calf serum, and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic solution (Life Technologies, Inc., Mississauga, ON, Canada). Cell surface-associated receptor binding assays and soluble receptor binding assays were performed as described previously (29Brown C.B. Beaudry P. Dickinson-Laing T. Shoemaker S. Kaushansky K. Blood. 1995; 85: 1488-1495Google Scholar). The soluble receptor binding assay is designed to specifically precipitate complexes of solGMRα/GM-CSF in the presence of PEG 6000 in a manner that allows for the receptor complexes to be separated from free components using centrifugation. The specific activity of the 125I-labeled human recombinant GM-CSF (DuPont NEN, Mississauga, ON, Canada) was determined using a human GM-CSF enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay and was found to differ from the values provided by the manufacturer. All experiments were analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay determined GM-CSF specific activity (422-1294 µCi/µg). The results of hot saturation receptor binding experiments (125I-GM-CSF concentration varied, and unlabeled GM-CSF was constant at >50-fold excess) were analyzed using the LIGAND software program (RADLIG v 4.0 for PC, Biosoft Inc., Cambridge, UK) to determine the statistically favored binding model, numbers of receptors, and dissociation constants. Soluble GMRα was purified to near homogeneity as described previously (29Brown C.B. Beaudry P. Dickinson-Laing T. Shoemaker S. Kaushansky K. Blood. 1995; 85: 1488-1495Google Scholar). The control buffer used in all experiments consisted of a late fraction collected from column purification of solGMRα and contained no GM-CSF binding activity. Column purified soluble GMRα was added to 106 GMRβ-expressing cells in binding reactions to give a concentration of 2.8 nM solGMRα (35,000 soluble receptors available to each cell, determined by Scatchard analysis) in a 25-µl volume. In addition, GMRβ-expressing cells were co-cultured with an equal number of solGMRα-expressing cells and were tested repeatedly over a period of 2 months for the presence of solGMRα on the cell surface using flow cytometry and cell receptor binding assays. After washing with 2 × 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), cells were detached from the tissue culture plates using Puck's solution (5.4 mM KCl, 140 mM NaCl, 4.2 mM NaHCO3, 5 mM dextrose, 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM EDTA) and rewashed three times with PBS. Cells were incubated with 0.5 µg/ml primary antibody (anti-GMRβ antibody 3D7 or mouse anti-human GMRα monoclonal antibody (CDw116), Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) in 1 ml of PBS for 30 min at 22°C. After a further three washes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium to remove unbound primary antibody, cells were incubated in 1 µg of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Becton Dickinson, Mississauga, ON, Canada) in a minimal volume for 30 min at 22°C. After washing three times in PBS to remove unbound secondary antibody, cells were resuspended in PBS containing 1 mM EDTA and were analyzed in a flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). To examine the interaction between exogenously added solGMRα and GMRβ in the presence of GM-CSF, we developed a BHK cell line that stably expresses GMRβ. The presence of GMRβ on the cell surface was confirmed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis using an anti-GMRβ monoclonal antibody (data not shown). The surface fluorescence level of GMRβ-expressing BHK cells is approximately 100-fold greater than that of GMRβ BHK cells incubated with the secondary antibody alone or control BHK cells. To examine for the potential interaction of exogenous solGMRα with cell-surface GMRβ in the presence of GM-CSF, we incubated our GMRβ-expressing cells with 125I-GM-CSF in the presence or the absence of a >50-fold excess of unlabeled GM-CSF in addition to column purified solGMRα or control buffer (Fig. 1) and looked for specifically bound 125I-GM-CSF (cell-associated counts that could be competed off by unlabeled GM-CSF) on the GMRβ cells. Untransfected BHK cells showed no specific binding of 125I-GM-CSF, and this was not altered by the presence of either control buffer or solGMRα. The tmGMRα-expressing cell line specifically bound GM-CSF and served as the positive control. The cell associated counts on tmGMRα-expressing cells decreased in the presence of exogenous solGMRα, confirming that solGMRα can compete with tmGMRα for the binding of GM-CSF (29Brown C.B. Beaudry P. Dickinson-Laing T. Shoemaker S. Kaushansky K. Blood. 1995; 85: 1488-1495Google Scholar). The control buffer had no effect. Our GMRβ cell line failed to show specific binding of GM-CSF even in the presence of exogenously added solGMRα indicating that although exogenous solGMRα is capable of binding GM-CSF (as shown by competition with tmGMRα for GM-CSF binding), this ligand-soluble receptor complex is unable to interact with GMRβ on the cell surface. To further test the ability of solGMRα to interact with GMRβ, we co-cultured equal numbers of GMRβ- and solGMRα-expressing cells and tested for the presence of soluble receptor on the cell surface by cell receptor binding assays and flow cytometry. The co-cultured cells were unable to bind GM-CSF and GMRα could not be demonstrated on the cell surface by flow cytometry (data not shown). In preliminary experiments conducted to determine the sensitivity of the binding assay, we could detect as few as 12 ± 2 receptors/cell on the cell surface (data not shown). Studies done by several groups have shown the presence of solGMRα transcripts in GMRβ-expressing cells (27Williams W.V. VonFeldt J.M. Rosenbaum H. Ugen K.E. Weiner D.B. Arthritis Rheum. 1994; 37: 1468-1478Google Scholar). To recreate this potential for co-expression in vitro, we co-transfected BHK cells with the cDNAs for both GMRβ and solGMRα. We confirmed the presence of cell surface GMRβ using flow cytometry and the expression of solGMRα by performing soluble receptor binding assays on cell culture supernatants from the solGMRα/GMRβ co-transfected BHK cells (data not shown). We examined the ability of solGMRα/GMRβ co-transfected cells to bind GM-CSF in cell receptor binding assays (Fig. 2) and found specific cell surface binding of 125I-GM-CSF. Specific cell-surface binding was absent in untransfected BHK cells and cells expressing either GMRβ alone or solGMRα alone. Several different solGMRα/GMRβ clones were examined, and all were capable of binding GM-CSF. Receptor binding assays were performed with the solGMRα/GMRβ-expressing cells (co-transfected cell line) and the tmGMRα/GMRβ-expressing cells (co-transfected cell line and HL-60 cells) to directly compare the dissociation constants (Kd) and the numbers of receptors (r) for these receptor complexes. The results were analyzed using the LIGAND software program, and representative Scatchard values are shown in Fig. 3. The co-transfected tmGMRα/GMRβ cells exhibit a single class of high affinity binding site (Kd = 64 ± 8.7 pM; r = 529 ± 24; n = 2) similar to HL-60 cells (Kd = 59 ± 10 pM; r = 79 ± 32; n = 3). The affinity of GM-CSF for solGMRα/GMRβ was intermediate (Kd = 331 ± 56 pM; r = 127 ± 55; n = 4) to the affinities of GM-CSF for the low (solGMRα, Kd = 3.8 ± 2.5 nM; n = 3) (29Brown C.B. Beaudry P. Dickinson-Laing T. Shoemaker S. Kaushansky K. Blood. 1995; 85: 1488-1495Google Scholar) and high (tmGMRα/GMRβ) affinity GM-CSF receptors. Scatchard analysis of solGMRα/GMRβ also revealed a single class of binding sites. To confirm the presence of solGMRα on the surface of the solGMRα/GMRβ cell line and to determine the ligand dependence of this interaction, we tested for the presence of solGMRα in the absence of GM-CSF by flow cytometry using an anti-GMRα monoclonal antibody (Fig. 4). The GMRβ cell line and cells expressing solGMRα alone were negative for cell surface GMRα expression. In contrast, solGMRα/GMRβ-expressing cells demonstrated an approximately 100-fold increase of cell associated fluorescence intensity, indicating the presence of solGMRα on the cell surface. The presence of cell surface solGMRα correlated with the expression of GMRβ and occurred in the absence of GM-CSF. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to confirm that only solGMRα and not tmGMRα was being expressed in these cells (data not shown). We have shown that exogenous solGMRα in the presence of GM-CSF is incapable of interacting with GMRβ expressed on the cell surface. In contrast, when solGMRα and GMRβ are co-expressed in BHK cells, we can demonstrate the retention of solGMRα on the cell surface in the presence or the absence of GM-CSF, suggesting that GMRβ anchors solGMRα on the cell surface in a ligand-independent manner. The α subunit of the GM-CSF receptor was first described as a 400-amino acid ligand binding protein expressed on the surface of GM-CSF-sensitive cells (11Gearing D.P. King J.A. Gough N.M. Nicola N.A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3667-3676Google Scholar). Since the initial characterization of the tmGMRα cDNA, many groups have described isoforms of this transcript including a second transmembrane form (GMRB) (26Crosier K.E. Wong G.G. Mathey-Prevot B. Nathan D.G. Sieff C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7744-7748Google Scholar), which differs from the original transcript in its cytoplasmic tail, and a soluble form (solGMRα), which lacks the transmembrane domain and has a unique 16-amino acid carboxyl-terminal tail (24Ashworth A. Kraft A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 7178Google Scholar, 25Raines M.A. Liu L. Quan S.G. Joe V. DiPersio J.F. Golde D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8203-8207Google Scholar). The soluble isoform of GMRα is likely generated by alternative splicing of GMRα RNA (23Nakagawa Y. Kosugi H. Miyajima A. Arai K. Yokota T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10905-10912Google Scholar), a mechanism commonly used for the generation of soluble cytokine receptors (10Heaney M.L. Golde D.W. Blood. 1996; 87: 847-857Google Scholar). This is in contrast to receptors like the IL-1R soluble isoform, which may be generated by proteolysis of the extracellular portion of the mature receptor (31Symons J.A. Duff G.W. FEBS Lett. 1990; 272: 133-136Google Scholar), and the soluble CNTF-R, which is released from the cell surface by cleavage of the glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol linkage by phospholipase C (32Davis S. Aldrich T.H. Valenzuela D.M. Wong V. Furth M.E. Squinto S.P. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1991; 253: 59-63Google Scholar). In vitro studies have shown that soluble cytokine receptors exhibit contrasting functions. Several have antagonist properties (20Kitamura T. Miyajima A. Blood. 1992; 80: 84-90Google Scholar, 27Williams W.V. VonFeldt J.M. Rosenbaum H. Ugen K.E. Weiner D.B. Arthritis Rheum. 1994; 37: 1468-1478Google Scholar, 33Tavernier J. Tuypens T. Plaetinck G.

Ip N.Y. Stahl N. Scherer S. Farruggella T. DiStefano P.S. Curtis R. Panayotatos N. Gascan H. Chevalier S. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1993; 259: 1736-1739Google Scholar) as exemplified by the solIL-5 receptor α subunit. This soluble receptor can bind IL-5 in solution and inhibit IL-5-dependent proliferation and differentiation (37Tavernier J. Devos R. Cornelis S. Tuypens T. Van der Heyden J. Fiers W. Plaetinck G. Cell. 1991; 66: 1175-1184Google Scholar). However, solIL-5Rα does not interact with the cell surface anchored IL-5R β subunit in the presence of IL-5 (33Tavernier J. Tuypens T. Plaetinck G. Verhee A. Fiers W. Devos R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7041-7045Google Scholar). In contrast, the soluble CNTF receptor exhibits agonist properties by binding CNTF in solution and subsequently interacting with cell surface anchored leukemia inhibitory factor receptor and gp 130 receptor subunits, the other components of the CNTF-R that are incapable of binding CNTF on their own (36Davis S. Aldrich T.H. Ip N.Y. Stahl N. Scherer S. Farruggella T. DiStefano P.S. Curtis R. Panayotatos N. Gascan H. Chevalier S. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1993; 259: 1736-1739Google Scholar). This interaction imparts new CNTF sensitivities to leukemia inhibitory factor receptor and gp130-expressing cells, which were previously unreactive toward CNTF. The soluble IL-6R shows a similar ability in that solIL-6R in the presence of IL-6 can interact with its β receptor component, gp130, and induce an IL-6 response in gp130-expressing cells normally unresponsive to IL-6 (34Taga T. Hibi M. Hirata Y. Yamasaki K. Yasukawa K. Matsuda T. Hirano T. Kishimoto T. Cell. 1989; 58: 573-581Google Scholar). To date, no soluble receptor has been shown to exhibit both antagonist properties and binding capabilities to their β subunit counterparts. Previous studies done by us and others have shown that solGMRα, when added exogenously to GM-CSF-dependent bio-assays, antagonizes GM-CSF activity (27Williams W.V. VonFeldt J.M. Rosenbaum H. Ugen K.E. Weiner D.B. Arthritis Rheum. 1994; 37: 1468-1478Google Scholar, 29Brown C.B. Beaudry P. Dickinson-Laing T. Shoemaker S. Kaushansky K. Blood. 1995; 85: 1488-1495Google Scholar). We undertook experiments to characterize the mechanism of this antagonism by solGMRα. By establishing a GMRβ-expressing cell line, we were able to examine the ability of exogenous solGMRα to interact with cell surface GMRβ in the presence of GM-CSF. We failed to see any interaction of exogenous solGMRα with cell surface GMRβ despite creating an assay that was capable of detecting as few as 12 ± 2 receptors/cell while providing approximately 35,000 solGMRα for each GMRβ-expressing cell. In addition, we could not detect cell surface solGMRα after co-culturing GMRβ-expressing cells with cells expressing solGMRα. This observation is similar to the characteristics exhibited by solIL-5Rα (33Tavernier J. Tuypens T. Plaetinck G. Verhee A. Fiers W. Devos R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7041-7045Google Scholar). Many cells of hematopoietic origin have been found to express mRNA transcripts for both solGMRα and GMRβ (27Williams W.V. VonFeldt J.M. Rosenbaum H. Ugen K.E. Weiner D.B. Arthritis Rheum. 1994; 37: 1468-1478Google Scholar, 28Heaney M.L. Vera J.C. Raines M.A. Golde D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2365-2369Google Scholar). We wanted to reflect this observation in an in vitro system and developed cell lines that co-express solGMRα and GMRβ. Using these cells, we were able to detect expression of solGMRα not only in the cell culture supernatant conditioned by solGMRα/GMRβ co-transfected cells but also on the surface of these cells. The cell surface expression of solGMRα resulted in functional GM-CSF binding; however, the retention of solGMRα on the cell surface was independent of GM-CSF. The solGMRα subunit exhibits both antagonistic properties and is capable of binding its β receptor subunit counterpart. Controversy remains as to whether tmGMRα and GMRβ exist as preformed complexes on the surface of cells. Recent evidence indicates they do not (16Eder M. Ernst T.J. Ganser A. Jubinsky P.T. Inhorn R. Hoelzer D. Griffin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30173-30180Google Scholar), and we cannot co-immunoprecipitate tmGMRα with GMRβ from co-transfected BHK cells unless GM-CSF is present. 2E. W. Murray and C. B. Brown, unpublished observations. This suggests that the binding of GM-CSF induces stabilization or assembly of the high affinity GMR complex. In contrast, the data presented in this paper suggest a direct, GM-CSF-independent interaction of solGMRα with GMRβ seen only when these subunits are co-expressed. Perhaps co-expression of solGMRα and GMRβ induces conformational changes in one or both of the subunits that reflect possible changes induced by GM-CSF binding to tmGMRα in the presence of GMRβ during high affinity complex formation on the cell surface. Ligand-independent interactions of tmGMRα and GMRβ have been described by Ronco et al. (38Ronco L.V. Silverman S.L. Wong S.G. Slamon D.J. Park L.S. Gasson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 277-283Google Scholar), who made a tmGMRα (Cys136→ Ser) mutant that was unable to bind GM-CSF but formed a high affinity GMR complex when co-expressed with GMRβ. They suggest this observation implies that tmGMRα/GMRβ exist as preformed complexes on the cell surface; however, immunoprecipitation studies in the presence or the absence of GM-CSF were not done to confirm this. It is possible that the mutation (Ala for Glu) present in our GMRβ clone is responsible for the cell surface retention of solGMRα in the co-transfected cell line. However, we utilized this GMRβ clone to produce the co-transfected tmGMRα/GMRβ cell line, and Scatchard analysis of 125I-GM-CSF receptor binding assays (Fig. 3) indicates that this cell line forms functional high affinity GM-CSF receptor complexes with a binding affinity comparable with HL-60 cells and with values reported widely in current literature (7DiPersio J.

A. 1986; 83: 669-673Google Scholar). We feel this observation suggests that at least with respect to GM-CSF binding, the GMRβ (A → C) clone behaves similarly to wild-type GMRβ and that GM-CSF-independent cell surface retention of solGMRα in the co-transfected cell lines is not merely a result of the GMRβ mutation. Most hematopoietic cells that bind GM-CSF do so with either low and/or high affinity (7DiPersio J. Billing P. Kaufman S. Eghtesady P. Williams R.E. Gasson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1834-1841Google Scholar, 39Gasson J.C. Kaufman S.E. Weisbart R.H. Tomonaga M. Golde D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 669-673Google Scholar, 40Baldwin G.C. Gasson J.C.

Blood. 1989; 73: 1033-1037Google Scholar), likely reflecting the presence of tmGMRα alone and/or tmGMRα/GMRβ complexes. Soluble GMRα has yet to be detected in vivo. HL-60 cells, a GM-CSF-sensitive human myeloid leukemic cell line (41Tomonaga M. Golde D.W. Gasson J.C. Blood. 1986; 67: 31-36Google Scholar), express native high affinity GM-CSF receptors with a dissociation constant (Kd) of approximately 14–60 pM (7DiPersio J. Billing P. Kaufman S. Eghtesady P. Williams R.E. Gasson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1834-1841Google Scholar, 39Gasson J.C. Kaufman S.E. Weisbart R.H. Tomonaga M. Golde D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 669-673Google Scholar). In addition, Heaney et al. (28Heaney M.L. Vera J.C. Raines M.A. Golde D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2365-2369Google Scholar) have shown that HL-60 cells make the mRNA transcript for solGMRα. Interestingly, cross-linking and immunoprecipitation studies of the cell surface GM-CSF receptors on HL-60 cells show the presence of two major bands after gel electrophoresis (7DiPersio J. Billing P. Kaufman S. Eghtesady P. Williams R.E. Gasson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1834-1841Google Scholar). One corresponds well to the tmGMRα subunit; however, the second, smaller band is undefined by the authors and may represent the soluble receptor. A smaller band is also detected by immunoprecipitation and cross-linking studies in the M14 melanoma cell line (42Baldwin G.C. Golde D.W. Widhopf G.F. Economou J. Gasson J.C. Blood. 1991; 78: 609-615Google Scholar) and in COS cells (40Baldwin G.C. Gasson J.C. Kaufman S.E. Quan S.G. Williams R.E. Avalos B.R. Gazdar A.F. Golde D.W. DiPersio J.F. Blood. 1989; 73: 1033-1037Google Scholar). We were able to detect solGMRα in both cell culture supernatant and on the surface of solGMRα/GMRβ co-transfected cells, suggesting that solGMRα is likely in excess and there are no “free”β subunits left to interact with. This solGMRα/GMRβ cell surface interaction appears to be stable and has GM-CSF binding capabilities of intermediate affinity. Intermediate binding affinity for GM-CSF has also been demonstrated in primary melanoma cells (Kd = 230 pM) and the M14 melanoma cell line (Kd = 720 pM) (42Baldwin G.C. Golde D.W. Widhopf G.F. Economou J. Gasson J.C. Blood. 1991; 78: 609-615Google Scholar) and in COS cells (Kd = 510 pM) (40Baldwin G.C. Gasson J.C. Kaufman S.E. Quan S.G. Williams R.E. Avalos B.R. Gazdar A.F. Golde D.W. DiPersio J.F. Blood. 1989; 73: 1033-1037Google Scholar). In addition, Cannistra et al. (43Cannistra S.A. Koenigsmann M. DiCarlo J. Groshek P. Griffin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12656-12663Google Scholar) found neutrophils to have a 2-fold lower binding affinity for GM-CSF (Kd = 90 pM) than other high affinity myeloid cells (monocytes, 24 pM; purified normal bone marrow, 39 pM; myeloblasts from patients with AML, 34 pM), whereas others have found neutrophils to have a single class of high affinity GM-CSF receptors (Kd = 17–50 pM) (7DiPersio J. Billing P. Kaufman S. Eghtesady P. Williams R.E. Gasson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1834-1841Google Scholar, 39Gasson J.C. Kaufman S.E. Weisbart R.H. Tomonaga M. Golde D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 669-673Google Scholar). A number of mechanisms can be involved to account for such intermediate affinities; however, it is possible that the intermediate binding affinities observed for some cell types may represent the presence of soluble GMRα on the cell surface. Questions have remained over the physiological significance of solGMRα in vivo. Two recent studies have examined the ratios of solGMRα to tmGMRα transcript levels in vitro in an attempt to elucidate a role for solGMRα in vivo (27Williams W.V. VonFeldt J.M. Rosenbaum H. Ugen K.E. Weiner D.B. Arthritis Rheum. 1994; 37: 1468-1478Google Scholar, 28Heaney M.L. Vera J.C. Raines M.A. Golde D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2365-2369Google Scholar). Both groups have demonstrated that the ratio of solGMRα to tmGMRα transcripts varies depending on the cell examined, the state of cellular differentiation and, in some instances, the presence of a disease phenotype, suggesting that the expression of solGMRα and tmGMRα are independently regulated. These studies support the idea that solGMRα plays a significant physiological role in vivo. Our data represent the first report of a soluble receptor having both antagonistic properties when exogenous to the cell and the ability to interact with its β counterpart when co-expressed. The significance of this observation is unknown. Until studies on the functions of solGMRα are performed in vivo, the physiological significance of solGMRα remains speculative.

https://openalex.org/W2076035135,"A transgenic mouse overexpressing a mutant form of calmodulin (CaM-8) that is selectively targeted to pancreatic beta-cells has an impaired ability to secrete insulin in response to elevated blood glucose. Fluorescence measurements of cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) showed that intracellular Ca2+ rises produced by glucose were smaller than normal in beta-cells of CaM-8 mice. Glucose utilization rates were not different between the CaM-8 and control beta-cells, suggesting that glucose metabolism was unperturbed by CaM-8. Ion channel defects were implicated in the phenotype of CaM-8 beta-cells because treatment of these cells with tolbutamide, a blocker of ATP-sensitive K+ channels, produced smaller than normal amounts of insulin secretion and Ca2+ rises. Depolarization with elevated extracellular K+ also produced smaller Ca2+ rises in beta-cells from CaM-8 mice. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings revealed that Ca2+ channel currents of beta-cells from CaM-8 mice were half as large as Ca2+ currents in control cells, while the currents carried by delayed rectifier and ATP-sensitive K+ channels were similar in magnitude in both cell types. We conclude that expression of the CaM-8 form of calmodulin causes a down-regulation of Ca2+ channel currents, which reduces Ca2+ entry and accumulation when glucose stimulates closure of the ATP-sensitive K+ channels. The reduction in intracellular Ca2+ accumulation then prevents an adequate amount of insulin from being secreted from beta-cells of CaM-8 mice.

The reduction in intracellular Ca2+ accumulation then prevents an adequate amount of insulin from being secreted from beta-cells of CaM-8 mice. The exocytotic secretion of insulin from pancreatic beta-cells requires the transduction of numerous internal and external signals, beginning with the sensing of elevated glucose levels (1Holz G.G. Habener J.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 388-393Google Scholar, 2German M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1781-1785Google Scholar). The transduction of the glucose signal through metabolic pathways results in the generation of ATP which closes ATP-dependent K+ channels in the plasma membrane (3Rorsman P. Trube G. Pflugers Arch. 1985; 405: 305-309Google Scholar, 4Ashcroft S.J.H. Ashcroft F.M. Cell. Signaling. 1990; 2: 197-214Google Scholar). This depolarizes the membrane and opens voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, elevating the intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) 1The abbreviations used are: [Ca2+]icytosolic calcium concentrationCaMcalmodulinKRBKreb's Ringer-bicarbonate. and triggering exocytotic insulin secretion (5Rorsman P. Trube G. J. Physiol. 1986; 374: 531-550Google Scholar, 6Smith P.A. Rorsman P. Ashcroft F.M. Nature. 1989; 342: 550-553Google Scholar, 7Herchuelz A. Pochet R. Pastiels C. VanPraet A. Cell Calcium. 1991; 12: 577-586Google Scholar). The molecular basis of the action of Ca2+ in insulin secretion is not clear, although it has been proposed that the intracellular Ca2+-receptor protein, calmodulin (CaM), may play a key role in this process (8Sugden M.C. Christie M.R. Ashcroft S.T. FEBS Lett. 1979; 105: 95-100Google Scholar, 9Henquin J.C. Biochem. J. 1981; 196: 771-780Google Scholar, 10Valverde I. Malaisse W.J. Experimentia. 1984; 40: 1061-1068Google Scholar). cytosolic calcium concentration calmodulin Kreb's Ringer-bicarbonate. As part of an effort to elucidate the functional role of calmodulin in pancreatic beta-cells, transgenic mouse lines have been established that specifically overexpress CaM in their beta-cells (11Epstein P.N. Overbeek P.A. Means A.R. Cell. 1989; 58: 1067-1073Google Scholar). These mice have defective insulin secretion at an early age, due to an impairment in the metabolism of glucose and the subsequent generation of ATP (12Epstein P.N. Ribar T.J. Decker G.L. Yaney G. Means A.R. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 1387-1393Google Scholar, 13Ribar T.J. Jan C.R. Augustine G.J. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28688-28695Google Scholar). Another mouse line, referred to as CaM-8, expresses in its beta-cells a mutant form of CaM that lacks 8 amino acids in its central helix and does not activate calmodulin-dependent proteins in vitro even though this protein binds Ca2+ with normal affinity (14VanBerkum M.F.A. George S.E. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3750-3756Google Scholar). These mice also demonstrate a reduced insulin secretion in response to fuel secretagogues such as glucose (15Ribar T.J. Epstein P.N. Overbeek P.A. Means A.R. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 106-115Google Scholar), which is surprising because overexpression of this mutant form of CaM in cardiac atrial cells produces no phenotypic abnormalities (16Gruver C.L. DeMayo F. Goldstein M.A. Means A.R. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 376-388Google Scholar). Subtle differences in pancreatic beta-cell responses of 6–8-day-old postnatal CaM-8 and CaM mice suggest that the secretory defects may be different in the two lines of mice. For example, the onset of diabetes begins later in CaM-8 mice than in CaM mice and the kinetics of the glucose-induced secretion response is different in these two mice at this age (15Ribar T.J. Epstein P.N. Overbeek P.A. Means A.R. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 106-115Google Scholar). In addition, depolarization of the beta-cell membrane potential increases insulin secretion much more in CaM mice than in CaM-8 mice (reviewed in 15Ribar T.J. Epstein P.N. Overbeek P.A. Means A.R. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 106-115Google Scholar). Here we examine several key signaling events that underlie insulin secretion (1Holz G.G. Habener J.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 388-393Google Scholar, 2German M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1781-1785Google Scholar, 17Rajan A.S. Aguilar-Bryan L. Nelson D.A. Yaney G.C. Hsu W.H. Kunze D.L. Boyd III, A.E. Diabetes Care. 1990; 13: 340-363Google Scholar) in pancreatic beta-cells of CaM-8 mice. We find that the primary defect in beta-cells from CaM-8 mice is a remarkable reduction in the amount of Ca2+ flowing through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, which results in abnormally small rises in [Ca2+]i during glucose stimulation and presumably leads to or directly accounts for the diabetic phenotype of these animals. These results confirm that the nature and origin of the insulin secretory defect exhibited in CaM-8 mice is quite different from that of CaM mice (13Ribar T.J. Jan C.R. Augustine G.J. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28688-28695Google Scholar) and provide a useful experimental system for the study of intracellular Ca2+ signaling and Ca2+ channel regulation. CsOH was from Mallinckrodt Chemical Co., West Germany. All other chemical reagents were from Sigma, unless otherwise indicated. 6-8-day-old postnatal mice were obtained from active breeding colonies of transgenic CaM-8 and control mice. All animals were cared for in accordance with the rules and regulations set forth by the United States National Institutes of Health. Isolated islets were prepared from normal and CaM-8 mice by collagenase digestion and cultured in fully supplemented RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37°C in an atmosphere of 95% O2, 5% CO2 as described previously (12Epstein P.N. Ribar T.J. Decker G.L. Yaney G. Means A.R. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 1387-1393Google Scholar, 15Ribar T.J. Epstein P.N. Overbeek P.A. Means A.R. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 106-115Google Scholar). Single beta-cells used for patch-clamp analysis were prepared from acutely isolated islets using EDTA and trypsin treatment as described by Ribar et al. (13Ribar T.J. Jan C.R. Augustine G.J. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28688-28695Google Scholar). Isolated beta-cells were then suspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 11.1 mM glucose, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin, plated into 24-well plates (Becton Dickinson, Oxnard, CA) containing 12-mm round glass coverslips (Fischer), and incubated at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% O2, 5% CO2 for 1–3 days until used for experiments. The membrane-permeant fluorescent dyes, fura-2-AM and indo-1-AM (18Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Google Scholar), were used to measure [Ca2+]i in islets and individual beta-cells, respectively. Dyes were loaded into either islets or cells as described previously (13Ribar T.J. Jan C.R. Augustine G.J. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28688-28695Google Scholar). Prior to recording, islets or beta-cells were allowed to equilibrate in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate (133 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM CaCl2, 5 mM KCl, 1.2 mM MgSO4, 1.2 mM KH2PO4, and 5 mM NaHCO3) supplemented with 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2.8 mM glucose, and 15 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) for 45 min at 30–37°C that was also equilibrated with 95% O2, 5% CO2, Fura-2 (Molecular Probes, Junction City, OR) fluorescence was measured using a Zeiss Standard microscope equipped with a Leitz 50× water-immersion objective (1.0 numerical aperture) and the spinning wheel photomultiplier-based system described by Neher (19Neher, E, 1989 in Sellin, L. C., Libelius, R., Thesleff, S., (eds) Neuromuscular Junction, pp. 65–76, Elsevier, Amsterdam.Google Scholar). Fura-2 was excited with light alternated between 360 and 390 nm, while a photomultiplier was used to measure dye emission at wavelengths greater than 510 nm. [Ca2+]i was calculated from the ratio of the light emitted when the dye was excited by the two excitation wavelengths as described previously (19Neher, E, 1989 in Sellin, L. C., Libelius, R., Thesleff, S., (eds) Neuromuscular Junction, pp. 65–76, Elsevier, Amsterdam.Google Scholar, 20Augustine G.J. Neher E. J. Physiol. 1992; 450: 247-271Google Scholar), using software written in AxoBasic by Hui Qiu (Duke University). Indo-1 (Molecular Probes) fluorescence was measured on a Nikon Optiphot microscope equipped with an Odyssey real-time laser-scanning confocal microscope (Noran, Middleton, WI). This microscope was equipped with a water-cooled argon ion laser to excite the dye at 350–360 nm; emitted fluorescence was measured at two emission wavelengths (400–450 nm and 450–500 nm), and fluorescence images were processed with Image-1 software (Universal Imaging, Philadelphia, PA). Insulin secretion from isolated islets was measured with the procedures described by Epstein et al. (12Epstein P.N. Ribar T.J. Decker G.L. Yaney G. Means A.R. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 1387-1393Google Scholar) and Ribar et al. (15Ribar T.J. Epstein P.N. Overbeek P.A. Means A.R. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 106-115Google Scholar). Briefly, 100–200 islets that were cultured short term (24 h) were placed in sealed perifusion chambers (0.5-ml volume) on 0.65 mM Milipore DVPP membranes (Milipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Krebs Ringer bicarbonate (see [Ca2+]i measurement description) containing the appropriate secretagogue was pumped through the chamber at a rate of 300 µl/min at 37°C, collected, and frozen at −20°C until analyzed. Secreted insulin was measured in the eluate fractions using a double-antibody mouse insulin radioimmunoassay kit (Linco, St. Louis, MO) which uses rat insulin as a standard. Glucose utilization assays were done as previously detailed (13Ribar T.J. Jan C.R. Augustine G.J. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28688-28695Google Scholar, 21Ashcroft S.J.H. Weerasinghe L.C.C. Bassett J.M. Randle P.J. Biochem. J. 1972; 126: 525-532Google Scholar) by measuring the formation of 3H2O from the metabolism of D[5-3H]glucose (Amersham Corp.). Conventional whole-cell patch-clamp methods (22Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.T. Pflugers Archiv. 1981; 391: 85-100Google Scholar) were used to measure and control the membrane potential of single beta-cells, as well as to measure transmembrane currents and control the ionic composition of the cell interior. Pipettes were pulled from filamented thin-walled borosilicate glass (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL), and their tips were fire-polished with a microforge. After filling with various internal solutions (see below), pipette resistances ranged from 3 to 5 megohms. The pipette was connected to a patch-clamp amplifier (EPC-9, HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht, West Germany) and a tight seal (>1 gegaohm) was established between the pipette tip and the cell membrane by gentle suction. The whole-cell recording configuration was then obtained by applying a brief pulse of negative pressure to break the membrane patch spanning the pipette tip. All experiments were performed at a temperature of 30–37°C. For Ca2+ current measurements, the extracellular solution contained (in mM) 130 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 1.2 MgCl2, 5.4 CaCl2, 24 NaHCO3, 20 NaHEPES, 2.8 glucose and was oxygenated with a 95% O2, 5% CO2 mixture. In these experiments, the intracellular solution filling the pipette contained (in mM) 145 CsCl, 4 MgCl2, 3 Na2ATP, 10 NaHEPES, 10 Cs2EGTA, 0.3 GTP, and was adjusted to pH 7.15 with CsOH. When measuring K+ currents, the external solution contained (in mM) 133 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2.4 CaCl2, 1.2 MgCl2, 1.1 KH2PO4, 24 NaHCO3, 20 NaHEPES, 2.8 glucose and was oxygenated with 95% O2, 5% CO2. The internal pipette solution varied according to the K+ channel being studied. For delayed rectifier K+ current measurements, it was (in mM) 140 KCl, 10 NaHEPES, 2 Na2ATP, 2 MgCl2, 1 Na2EGTA, and adjusted to pH 7.35 with KOH. Studies of ATP-sensitive K+ current employed (in mM) 140 KCl, 10 NaHEPES, 1 Na2EGTA, 0.3 Na2ATP, 2 MgCl2, and adjusted to pH 7.35 with CsOH. All values are reported as the mean ± S.E. Statistical comparisons were done by utilizing the Student's t test. A significant difference was accepted when p < 0.05. Given the essential role of intracellular calcium in glucose-induced insulin secretion (23Grodsky G.M. Bennett L.L. Diabetes. 1966; 15: 910-912Google Scholar, 24Wang J. Baimbridge K.G. Brown J.C. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 146-152Google Scholar), we examined the ability of glucose to elevate cytosolic [Ca2+]i in beta-cells of CaM-8 and normal mice. For these experiments, isolated pancreatic islets were loaded with the membrane-permeant, fluorescent indicator dye, fura-2-AM (18Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Google Scholar), to monitor [Ca2+]i. Fig. 1 shows examples of experiments illustrating that perifusion of control and CaM-8 islets with Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate saline (KRB) containing a low concentration of glucose (2.8 mM) produced resting [Ca2+]i levels that were similar for both types of islets. Resting [Ca2+]i, measured in KRB containing 2.8 mM glucose, was approximately 100 nM for both control and CaM-8 islets (Fig. 2A) and did not differ significantly between the two groups (p > 0.60). Elevation of the extracellular glucose concentration to 16.8 mM produced robust rises in [Ca2+]i from control cells (Fig. 1, top), as reported in earlier work (24Wang J. Baimbridge K.G. Brown J.C. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 146-152Google Scholar). In contrast, glucose-induced [Ca2+]i rises were much smaller in islets isolated from CaM-8 mice (Fig. 1, bottom). While [Ca2+]i in normal islets increased by approximately 200 nM above the resting level upon exposure to KRB containing 16.8 mM glucose, this rise in [Ca2+]i was only about one-third as large in islets from CaM-8 mice (Fig. 2B). The difference between the mean rises in [Ca2+]i induced by glucose in the two types of islets was significantly different (p < 0.05). Thus, the ability of glucose to elevate [Ca2+]i is impaired in islets from CaM-8 mice.Fig. 2A, mean resting [Ca2+]i in control and CaM-8 islets. B, mean increase in [Ca2+]i (difference between peak [Ca2+]i and resting [Ca2+]i) produced by perifusing islets with 16.8 mM glucose (*p < 0.05). C, mean increase in [Ca2+]i when these same islets were perifused with 16.8 mM glucose and 50 mM K+.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Because it has been suggested that dissociated beta-cells can produce glucose-induced [Ca2+]i responses which differ from those of intact islets (25Smolen P. Rinzel Sherman A. Biophys. J. 1993; 64: 1668-1680Google Scholar), we also measured [Ca2+]i in dissociated beta-cells loaded with indo-1-AM, another membrane-permeant indicator dye. We found that glucose-induced [Ca2+]i transients also were smaller in beta-cells from CaM-8 mice than those in beta-cells from normal mice (data not shown). Thus, in our case the [Ca2+]i responses of isolated beta-cells paralleled those of intact islets, with both indicating that beta-cells from CaM-8 mice produced smaller glucose-induced rises in [Ca2+]i than cells from control mice. In summary, our measurements of [Ca2+]i reveal significant deficiencies in the glucose-induced calcium signaling pathway of CaM-8 beta-cells. Because of the essential role of this pathway for glucose-dependent insulin secretion, it is likely that these deficiencies account for the defective insulin secretion characteristic of the CaM-8 mouse. We next determined the mechanisms underlying this lesion in the calcium signaling pathway. The glucose-induced [Ca2+]i signaling pathway begins with extracellular glucose being transported into β-cells and converted into ATP. To determine whether these early steps in the pathway were altered in CaM-8 mice, we measured the rate of glucose utilization of CaM-8 islets. Fig. 3 shows that under basal metabolic conditions, CaM-8 islets (n = 23) utilized glucose at a rate that was not significantly different (p > 0.10) from that of control islets (n = 32). Elevating the glucose concentration to 16.8 mM resulted in an approximately 4-fold increase in glucose utilization by both CaM-8 and control islets (p > 0.70). These measurements show that glucose metabolism is normal in CaM-8 mice and indicate that the defect in glucose-induced Ca2+ signaling must be downstream of this early step in the signaling cascade. Further, because glucose utilization can be used to predict whether sufficient ATP will be produced to close ATP-sensitive K+ channels (21Ashcroft S.J.H. Weerasinghe L.C.C. Bassett J.M. Randle P.J. Biochem. J. 1972; 126: 525-532Google Scholar), our results suggest that these channels should experience normal ATP levels in CaM-8 cells. The reduced glucose-induced [Ca2+]i signaling of CaM-8 beta-cells could result from a defect in any (or all) of the ion channels that regulate the membrane potential of beta-cells. We next performed experiments designed to identify the ion channel abnormalities that underlie this defect in the glucose-induced calcium signaling pathway. Glucose metabolism in beta-cells induces insulin secretion by closing ATP-sensitive K+ channels in the plasma membrane (4Ashcroft S.J.H. Ashcroft F.M. Cell. Signaling. 1990; 2: 197-214Google Scholar, 26Ashcroft F.M. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1988; 11: 97-118Google Scholar). As an initial test of the function of these channels and their downstream effectors, we examined the sensitivity of CaM-8 islets to tolbutamide, a sulfonylurea drug that blocks ATP-sensitive K+ channels and induces insulin secretion by depolarizating the beta-cell membrane potential (4Ashcroft S.J.H. Ashcroft F.M. Cell. Signaling. 1990; 2: 197-214Google Scholar, 27Trube G. Rorsman P. Ohno Shosaku T. Pflugers Arch. 1986; 407: 493-499Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows that, under basal conditions (2.8 mM glucose), CaM-8 islets and control islets secreted similar amounts of insulin. Addition of tolbutamide (1 mM) induced a 4-fold increase in insulin secretion in the presence of 2.8 mM glucose in control islets. However, while exposure of CaM-8 islets to this concentration of tolbutamide produced an initial burst of insulin secretion, subsequent secretion was only about twice the basal rate (p < 0.05). Furthermore, whereas addition of a high concentration (16.8 mM) of glucose to the tolbutamide-containing saline caused control islets to produce an additional 3-fold increase in insulin secretion, CaM-8 islets (Fig. 4) failed to respond further (p < 0.001). Thus, tolbutamide was less capable of evoking insulin secretion from islets from CaM-8 mice. The differential effects of tolbutamide on insulin secretion in control and CaM-8 islets were paralleled by the actions of this drug upon [Ca2+]i. For both control and CaM-8 islets, treatment with 1 mM tolbutamide (in the presence of 2.8 mM glucose) resulted in sustained and reversible increases in [Ca2+]i, as measured with fura-2 (Fig. 5A). However, the mean rise in [Ca2+]i induced by tolbutamide was approximately half as large in CaM-8 islets as in islets from normal mice (Fig. 5B); this difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05). Taken together, these results indicate that the secretory defect in CaM-8 cells could reside at the level of the ATP-sensitive K+ channels or at some subsequent step in the pathway that normally leads to a rise in [Ca2+]i and resultant secretion of insulin. We next used whole-cell patch-clamp methods (22Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.T. Pflugers Archiv. 1981; 391: 85-100Google Scholar) to examine directly the properties of ATP-sensitive K+ channels in CaM-8 beta-cells. Ionic currents flowing through ATP-sensitive K+ channels were measured using the paradigm illustrated in Fig. 6A. These currents were activated by progressively lowering the cytosolic concentration of ATP by dialyzing the cell interior with a patch pipette solution containing a low concentration (0.3 mM) of ATP (5Rorsman P. Trube G. J. Physiol. 1986; 374: 531-550Google Scholar, 13Ribar T.J. Jan C.R. Augustine G.J. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28688-28695Google Scholar). The amplitude of these currents reached a plateau and then slowly declined after about 10 min (not shown), presumably because the ATP-sensitive K+ channels exhibit “wash-out” during prolonged intracellular dialysis (5Rorsman P. Trube G. J. Physiol. 1986; 374: 531-550Google Scholar). These dialysis-induced currents were unequivocally identified as ATP-sensitive K+ currents because they were rapidly blocked by tolbutamide (0.1 mM; Fig. 6A). While the ATP-sensitive K+ channels were opening during removal of intracellular ATP, the beta-cell membrane potential was alternated between −60, −70, and −80 mV to study the voltage-dependence of the induced currents. These currents were inward at −80 mV and outward at −60 mV; since the equilibrium potential for K+ is approximately −76 mV under our experimental conditions, this behavior is as expected for a current carried by K+ ions. The slope of the relationship between the magnitude of the ATP-sensitive K+ currents and the membrane potential gives the ATP-sensitive K+ conductance; this value was normalized by dividing by the membrane capacitance measured for each cell, to take into account variations in cell membrane area (22Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.T. Pflugers Archiv. 1981; 391: 85-100Google Scholar). When measured in this way, as shown in Fig. 6B, the average ATP-sensitive K+ conductance of CaM-8 beta-cells (n = 19) was found to be significantly larger (p < 0.05) than that of control beta-cells (n = 27). This indicates that beta-cells of CaM-8 mice have a relatively high density of ATP-sensitive K+ channels that are able to function normally. Thus, the defects in glucose-induced and tolbutamide-induced insulin secretion and [Ca2+]i signaling must have a source other than loss of ATP-sensitive K+ channels. The delayed rectifier K+ channel is another type of ion channel that regulates the Ca2+ entry that triggers insulin secretion (5Rorsman P. Trube G. J. Physiol. 1986; 374: 531-550Google Scholar, 17Rajan A.S. Aguilar-Bryan L. Nelson D.A. Yaney G.C. Hsu W.H. Kunze D.L. Boyd III, A.E. Diabetes Care. 1990; 13: 340-363Google Scholar). Currents flowing through this type of K+ channel were measured in isolation by including the Ca2+ buffer, EGTA, in the pipette solution to prevent the rise in [Ca2+]i that would normally activate Ca2+-dependent K+ currents (28Bokvist K. Rorsman P. Smith P.A. J. Physiol. 1990; 423: 327-342Google Scholar), as well as ATP to close the ATP-sensitive K+ channels. Fig. 7A illustrates the ionic currents produced under these conditions when beta-cells were held at a membrane potential of −70 mV and briefly depolarized to a variety of more positive potentials. The resultant currents were outward in polarity, activated rapidly and did not inactivate during 200 ms long depolarizations. Further, they were eliminated by extracellular application of tetraethylammonium ions (data not shown), a blocker of delayed rectifier channels in these cells (28Bokvist K. Rorsman P. Smith P.A. J. Physiol. 1990; 423: 327-342Google Scholar). These properties indicate that the currents measured were K+ currents flowing through delayed rectifier channels. The time course and magnitude of delayed rectifier currents were very similar in beta-cells from control and CaM-8 mice. Membrane current density was quantified for each individual cell by dividing current amplitude by the membrane capacitance. The voltage-dependence of K+ current density was very similar for the two types of beta-cells (Fig. 7B). In both types of cells, delayed rectifier K+ currents activated at membrane potentials of −60 mV and increased in magnitude at more positive potentials. The peak delayed rectifier K+ conductance, measured at +30 mV, was 0.92 ± 0.14 nanosiemens/picofarad in CaM-8 cells (n = 12) and 1.23 ± 0.25 nanosiemens/picofarad in control cells (n = 25) at +30 mV. These two means are not significantly different from each other (p > 0.20), indicating that the delayed rectifier K+ currents in CaM-8 cells are indistinguishable from those of controls. Thus, delayed rectifier K+ channels are not the cause of the low [Ca2+]i transients that lead to deficient insulin secretion in the CaM-8 mice. The reduced glucose-induced [Ca2+]i signaling of CaM-8 beta-cells could result from a defect in voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. We initially tested this possibility by using fura-2 to measure the rises in [Ca2+]i produced when these channels were opened by depolarizing the beta-cell membrane potential by treatment with saline containing 50 mM K+. As has been reported previously (7Herchuelz A. Pochet R. Pastiels C. VanPraet A. Cell Calcium. 1991; 12: 577-586Google Scholar, 13Ribar T.J. Jan C.R. Augustine G.J. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28688-28695Google Scholar), this treatment produced a prompt elevation of [Ca2+]i in islets from normal mice (right side of Fig. 1A). These responses were substantially reduced in islets from CaM-8 mice (Fig. 1B). The peak amplitude of the [Ca2+]- change produced by depolarization of control islets was approximately 400 nM above resting [Ca2+]i but was approximately half this value in CaM-8 mice (Fig. 2C). Although this difference was not statistically significant (p > 0.30), these data suggest possible changes in the Ca2+ channels of CaM-8 beta-cells. Experiments on dissociated beta-cells loaded with indo-1 also indicated similar reductions in the K+ induced [Ca2+]i rise in CaM-8 cells (data not shown). To examine Ca2+ channel properties more directly, we used patch-clamp methods to measure currents flowing through these channels. Ca2+ channel currents were examined in isolation by including cesium ions in the intracellular pipette solution to block K+ channels (29Smith P.A. Ashcroft F.M. Fewtrell C.M.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1993; 101: 767-797Google Scholar). Families of Ca2+ currents recorded from control and CaM-8 cells under such conditions are shown in Fig. 8A. In both cases, the membrane potential initially was held at −70 mV and then briefly stepped to more depolarized voltages to open voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. While the kinetics of these currents were similar in the two populations of cells, Ca2+ current amplitude appeared to be smaller in the CaM-8 cells. This was quantified by calculating Ca2+ current density, using the procedure already described for K+ currents, and determining this parameter over a range of membrane potentials (Fig. 8B). There were no obvious differences in the voltage dependence of Ca2+ currents in beta-cells from the two types of mice; in both cases, Ca2+ currents were activated at −50 mV, increased in magnitude as voltage was increased up to 0 mV, and decreased at more positive potentials. For both cell types, the currents reversed polarity at +50 mV, though efflux of Cs+ makes this value an underestimate of the true reversal potential for Ca2+ currents (30Hess P. Tsien R.W. Nature. 1984; 309: 453-456Google Scho"
