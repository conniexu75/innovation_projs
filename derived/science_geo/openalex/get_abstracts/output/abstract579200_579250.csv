https://openalex.org/W2584523198,"Treatment management for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) has been challenging. However, electroencephalogram (EEG)-based predictions of antidepressant's treatment outcome may help during antidepressant's selection and ultimately improve the quality of life for MDD patients. In this study, a machine learning (ML) method involving pretreatment EEG data was proposed to perform such predictions for Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRIs). For this purpose, the acquisition of experimental data involved 34 MDD patients and 30 healthy controls. Consequently, a feature matrix was constructed involving time-frequency decomposition of EEG data based on wavelet transform (WT) analysis, termed as EEG data matrix. However, the resultant EEG data matrix had high dimensionality. Therefore, dimension reduction was performed based on a rank-based feature selection method according to a criterion, i.e., receiver operating characteristic (ROC). As a result, the most significant features were identified and further be utilized during the training and testing of a classification model, i.e., the logistic regression (LR) classifier. Finally, the LR model was validated with 100 iterations of 10-fold cross-validation (10-CV). The classification results were compared with short-time Fourier transform (STFT) analysis, and empirical mode decompositions (EMD). The wavelet features extracted from frontal and temporal EEG data were found statistically significant. In comparison with other time-frequency approaches such as the STFT and EMD, the WT analysis has shown highest classification accuracy, i.e., accuracy = 87.5%, sensitivity = 95%, and specificity = 80%. In conclusion, significant wavelet coefficients extracted from frontal and temporal pre-treatment EEG data involving delta and theta frequency bands may predict antidepressant's treatment outcome for the MDD patients."
https://openalex.org/W2584790477,"Mapping quantitative trait loci through the use of linkage disequilibrium (LD) in populations of unrelated individuals provides a valuable approach for dissecting the genetic basis of complex traits in soybean (Glycine max). The haplotype-based genome-wide association study (GWAS) has now been proposed as a complementary approach to intensify benefits from LD, which enable to assess the genetic determinants of agronomic traits. In this study a GWAS was undertaken to identify genomic regions that control 100-seed weight (SW), plant height (PH) and seed yield (SY) in a soybean association mapping panel using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers and haplotype information. The soybean cultivars (N = 169) were field-evaluated across four locations of southern Brazil. The genome-wide haplotype association analysis (941 haplotypes) identified eleven, seventeen and fifty-nine SNP-based haplotypes significantly associated with SY, SW and PH, respectively. Although most marker-trait associations were environment and trait specific, stable haplotype associations were identified for SY and SW across environments (i.e., haplotypes Gm12_Hap12). The haplotype block 42 on Chr19 (Gm19_Hap42) was confirmed to be associated with PH in two environments. These findings enable us to refine the breeding strategy for tropical soybean, which confirm that haplotype-based GWAS can provide new insights on the genetic determinants that are not captured by the single-marker approach."

In order to reduce the costs associated with frailty in older age groups, safe and cost-effective strategies are required that will reduce the incidence and severity of frailty.We investigated whether self-reported intensity of physical activity (sedentary, mild, moderate or vigorous) performed at least once a week can significantly reduce trajectories of frailty in older adults who are classified as non-frail at baseline (Rockwood's Frailty Index [FI] ≤ 0.25).Multi-level growth curve modelling was used to assess trajectories of frailty in 8649 non-frail adults aged 50 and over and according to baseline self-reported intensity of physical activity. Frailty was measured in five-year age cohorts based on age at baseline (50-54; 55-59; 60-64; 65-69; 70-74; 75-79; 80+) on up to 6 occasions, providing an average of 10 years of follow-up. All models were adjusted for baseline sex, education, wealth, cohabitation, smoking, and alcohol consumption.Compared with the sedentary reference group, mild physical activity was insufficient to significantly slow the progression of frailty, moderate physical activity reduced the progression of frailty in some age groups (particularly ages 65 and above) and vigorous activity significantly reduced the trajectory of frailty progression in all older adults.Healthy non-frail older adults require higher intensities of physical activity for continued improvement in frailty trajectories."
https://openalex.org/W2583178905,"Obesity is one of the most important public health issues worldwide. Moreover, an extreme phenotype, morbid obesity (MO) has insidiously become a global problem. Therefore, we aimed to document the prevalence trend and to unveil the epidemiological characteristics of MO in Taiwan.Nationally representative samples aged 19 years and above from three consecutive waves of Nutrition and Health survey in Taiwan: 1993-1996, 2005-2008, and 2013-2014 (n = 3,071; 1,673; and 1,440; respectively) were analyzed for prevalence trend. And 39 MO (BMI ≥35 kg/m2) cases from the two recent surveys compared with 156 age, gender, and survey-matched normal weight controls (BMI: 18.5-24 kg/m2) for epidemiological characteristics study. The reduced rank regression analysis was used to find dietary pattern associated with MO.The prevalence of overweight and obesity together (BMI ≥24 kg/m2) was stabilized in the recent two surveys, but that of MO (0.4%, 0.6%, to 1.4%) and obesity (BMI ≥27 kg/m2) (11.8%, 17.9%, to 22.0%) increased sharply. MO cases tended to have lower levels of education, personal income, and physical activity. Furthermore, their dietary pattern featured with a higher consumption frequency of red meat, processed animal products, and sweets/sweetened beverage, but lower frequencies of fresh fruits, nuts, breakfast cereal, and dairy products.This study documents a polarization phenomenon with smaller proportion of overweight people at the center and higher proportions of normal weight and obesity subjects at two extremes. MO was associated with low socioeconomic status and poor dietary pattern. The obesogenic dietary pattern became more prevalent in later time."
https://openalex.org/W2583270703,"Background & aims Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is an increasing health issue that develops rather unnoticed with obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome. We investigated prevalence, determinants and associated metabolic abnormalities of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in the largest population-based cohort to date. Methods Biochemical characteristics, type 2 diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome were determined in the Lifelines Cohort Study (N = 167,729), a population-based cohort in the North of the Netherlands. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease was defined as Fatty Liver Index (FLI)≥60. Exclusion criteria were age <18 years, immigrants, missing data to assess FLI and metabolic syndrome, excessive alcohol use, previous-diagnosed hepatitis or cirrhosis and non-fasting blood sampling. Results Out of 37,496 included participants (median age 44 years, 62.1% female), 8,259 (22.0%) had a FLI≥60. Individuals with a FLI≥60 were more often male, older, obese, had higher levels of hemoglobinA1c, fasting glucose, liver enzymes, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, c-reactive protein and leucocytes and lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (all P<0.0001). Participants with a FLI≥60 showed higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (9.3% vs. 1.4%), metabolic syndrome (54.2% vs. 6.2%), impaired renal function (20.1% vs. 8.7%) and cardiovascular disease (4.6% vs. 1.6%) (all P<0.0001). Multivariable logistic analysis showed that smoking, hemoglobin, leucocytes, c-reactive protein, platelets, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, impaired renal function (OR 1.27, 95%CI 1.15–1.41), metabolic syndrome (OR 11.89, 95%CI 11.03–12.82) and its individual components hyperglycemia (OR 2.53, 95%CI 2.34–2.72), hypertension (OR 1.89, 95%CI 1.77–2.01) and reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (OR 3.44, 95%CI 3.22–3.68) were independently associated with suspected non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (all P<0.0001). Conclusion Twenty-two percent (22.0%) of the population in the North of the Netherlands is suspected to suffer from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, coinciding with a significant increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease and impaired renal function."
https://openalex.org/W2584223899,"Peroxisome inheritance and differentiation For normal tissue structure and function, cells exert strict control over growth versus differentiation. Poor wound healing and aging can result from too little proliferation. Conversely, the development of cancer can involve excessive cell growth. Asare et al. looked for regulators that balance proliferation and differentiation in the epidermis (see the Perspective by Gruneberg and Barr). They observed differences in the transcript profile of epidermal progenitors, their differentiating progeny, and epidermal cancers. Epidermal progenitors that were deficient in the peroxisome-associate protein Pex11b did not segregate peroxisomes properly among dividing cells. This led to a delay in mitosis that perturbed polarized divisions. These events skewed daughter cell fate and resulted in a defective skin barrier. Thus, peroxisome inheritance appears to play a role in normal mitosis and cell differentiation. Science , this issue 10.1126/science.aah4701 ; see also p. 459"
https://openalex.org/W2585702337,"Background Diabetes kills more than 4.9 million adults per year. It becomes rapidly increasing, non-communicable disease—a major threat to global public health particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. Though previous studies among diabetic patients were focused in health institution, limited knowledge, attitude and practice were seen. There is no study conducted about diabetes related to knowledge, attitudes, practice and associated factors in the community level. Objective of the study The study assessed knowledge, attitude, practices, and its associated factors towards diabetes mellitus among non diabetic community members of Bale Zone, Ethiopia. Methods Community based cross-sectional study was conducted from November 15 to December 15, 2015 among 605 non diabetic community members of Bale Zone administrative towns. Data was collected using pretested structured face-to-face interview after taking informed written consent. Respondents were selected by systematic random sampling. The data was entered into EPI data version 3.1 and analyzed using Statistical package for social sciences version 20. Odds ratio and 95% confidence interval were calculated and P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Finally, multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to indicate the independent predictors of knowledge, attitude and practice. Result Response rate of the study was 98.2%. About 52.5% of participants were knowledgeable, 55.9% and 56.6% had good attitude and practice respectively. Earning average monthly family income of ≤500 Ethiopian birr (AOR = 0.4, CI = 0.2, 0.6) and 501–1000 (AOR = 0.4, CI = 0.2, 0.7), heard about diabetes (AOR = 4.4, CI = 1.9, 10.2), had diabetes health education exposure (AOR = 5, CI = 2.5, 9.7) resulted to have good diabetes knowledge. Student, (AOR = 5.1, CI = 2.1,12), government/private employee (AOR = 3,CI = 1.4,6.7), merchant (AOR = 2,CI = 1.1,3.6) and Knowledgeable (AOR = 3, CI = 2.1, 4.7) subjects had positive attitude towards diabetes. Having college and above educational level (AOR = 0.33, CI = 0.16, 0.7), having good attitude towards diabetes (AOR = 2, CI = 1.3, 3) had good practiced. Conclusion Considerable limited knowledge, attitude and practices were seen. A great emphasis on health education regarding symptoms and risk factors modification for diabetes are necessary."
https://openalex.org/W2583376552,"Fertilization sensitivity to heat in rice is a major issue within climate change scenarios in the tropics. A panel of 167 indica landraces and improved varieties was phenotyped for spikelet sterility (SPKST) under 38°C during anthesis and for several secondary traits potentially affecting panicle micro-climate and thus the fertilization process. The panel was genotyped with an average density of one marker per 29 kb using genotyping by sequencing. Genome-wide association analyses (GWAS) were conducted using three methods based on single marker regression, haplotype regression and simultaneous fitting of all markers, respectively. Fourteen loci significantly associated with SPKST under at least two GWAS methods were detected. A large number of associations was also detected for the secondary traits. Analysis of co-localization of SPKST associated loci with QTLs detected in progenies of bi-parental crosses reported in the literature allowed to narrow -down the position of eight of those QTLs, including the most documented one, qHTSF4.1. Gene families underlying loci associated with SPKST corresponded to functions ranging from sensing abiotic stresses and regulating plant response, such as wall-associated kinases and heat shock proteins, to cell division and gametophyte development. Analysis of diversity at the vicinity of loci associated with SPKST within the rice three thousand genomes, revealed widespread distribution of the favourable alleles across O. sativa genetic groups. However, few accessions assembled the favourable alleles at all loci. Effective donors included the heat tolerant variety N22 and some Indian and Taiwanese varieties. These results provide a basis for breeding for heat tolerance during anthesis and for functional validation of major loci governing this trait."
https://openalex.org/W2583620883,"Binge drinking (BD), a harmful pattern of alcohol consumption, is common during adolescence. Young adults with alcohol use disorders exhibit hippocampal alterations and episodic memory deficits. However, it is not known how these difficulties progress in community BD adolescents. Our objective was to analyze the relationship between BD trajectory and verbal episodic memory during the developmental period spanning from adolescence and to early adulthood. An initial sample of 155 male and female first-year university students with no other risk factors were followed over six years. Participants were classified as stable non-BDs, stable BDs and ex-BDs according to the third AUDIT item. At baseline, participants comprised 36 ♂/ 40 ♀ non-BDs (18.58 years), 40 ♂/ 39 ♀ BDs (18.87 years), and at the third follow-up, they comprised 8 ♂/ 8 ♀ stable non-BDs (25.49 years), 2 ♂/ 2 ♀ stable BDs (25.40) and 8 ♂/ 12 ♀ ex-BDs (24.97 years). Episodic memory was assessed four times with the Logical Memory subtest (WMS-III) and the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT). Generalized linear mixed models were applied. The results showed that, relative to non-BDs, stable BDs presented difficulties in immediate and delayed recall in the Logical Memory subtest. These difficulties remained stable over time. The short-term ex-BDs continued to display difficulties in immediate and delayed recall in the Logical Memory subtest, but long-term ex-BDs did not. The effects were not influenced by age of alcohol onset, frequency of cannabis use, tobacco use or psychopathological distress. In conclusion, BD during adolescence and young adulthood is associated with episodic memory deficits. Abandoning the BD pattern may lead to partial recovery. These findings are consistent with the vulnerability of the adolescent hippocampus to the neurotoxic effects of alcohol."
https://openalex.org/W2585808195,"Intracellular parasites can alter the cellular machinery of host cells to create a safe haven for their survival. In this regard, microsporidia are obligate intracellular fungal parasites with extremely reduced genomes and hence, they are strongly dependent on their host for energy and resources. To date, there are few studies into host cell manipulation by microsporidia, most of which have focused on morphological aspects. The microsporidia Nosema apis and Nosema ceranae are worldwide parasites of honey bees, infecting their ventricular epithelial cells. In this work, quantitative gene expression and histology were studied to investigate how these two parasites manipulate their host’s cells at the molecular level. Both these microsporidia provoke infection-induced regulation of genes involved in apoptosis and the cell cycle. The up-regulation of buffy (which encodes a pro-survival protein) and BIRC5 (belonging to the Inhibitor Apoptosis protein family) was observed after infection, shedding light on the pathways that these pathogens use to inhibit host cell apoptosis. Curiously, different routes related to cell cycle were modified after infection by each microsporidia. In the case of N. apis, cyclin B1, dacapo and E2F2 were up-regulated, whereas only cyclin E was up-regulated by N. ceranae, in both cases promoting the G1/S phase transition. This is the first report describing molecular pathways related to parasite-host interactions that are probably intended to ensure the parasite’s survival within the cell."
https://openalex.org/W2584159219,"Globally, case detection of tuberculosis (TB) has stabilized in recent years. Active case finding (ACF) has regained an increased attention as a complementary strategy to fill the case detection gap. In the Philippines, the DetecTB project implemented an innovative ACF strategy that offered a one-stop diagnostic service with a mobile unit equipped with enhanced diagnostic tools including chest X-ray (CXR) and Xpert®MTB/RIF (Xpert). The project targeted the rural poor, the urban poor, prison inmates, indigenous population and high school students.This is a retrospective review of TB screening data from 25,103 individuals. A descriptive analysis was carried out to compare screening and treatment outcomes across target populations. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify predictors of TB for each population. The composition of bacteriologically-confirmed cases by smear and symptom status was further investigated.The highest yield with lowest number needed to screen (NNS) was found in prison (6.2%, NNS: 16), followed by indigenous population (2.9%, NNS: 34), the rural poor (2.2%, NNS: 45), the urban poor (2.1%, NNS: 48), and high school (0.2%, NNS: 495). The treatment success rate for all populations was high with 89.5% in rifampicin-susceptible patients and 83.3% in rifampicin-resistant patients. A relatively higher loss to follow-up rate was observed in indigenous population (7.5%) and the rural poor (6.4%). Only cough more than two weeks showed a significant association with TB diagnosis in all target populations (Adjusted Odds Ratio ranging from 1.71 to 6.73) while other symptoms and demographic factors varied in their strength of association. The urban poor had the highest proportion of smear-positive patients with cough more than two weeks (72.0%). The proportion of smear-negative (Xpert-positive) patients without cough more than two weeks was the highest in indigenous population (39.3%), followed by prison inmates (27.7%), and the rural poor (22.8%).The innovative ACF strategy using mobile unit yielded a substantial number of TB patients and achieved successful treatment outcomes. TB screening in prison, indigenous population, and urban and rural poor communities was found to be effective. The combined use of CXR and Xpert largely contributed to increased case detection."
https://openalex.org/W2583120889,"Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) exhibit undesired phenotypic changes during ex vivo expansion, limiting production of the large quantities of high quality primary MSCs needed for both basic research and cell therapies. Primary MSCs retain many desired MSC properties including proliferative capacity and differentiation potential when expanded on decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM) prepared from primary MSCs. However, the need to use low passage number primary MSCs (passage 3 or lower) to produce the dECM drastically limits the utility and impact of this technology. Here, we report that primary MSCs expanded on dECM prepared from high passage number (passage 25) human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) transduced immortal MSC cell lines also exhibit increased proliferation and osteogenic differentiation. Two hTERT-transduced placenta-derived MSC cell lines, CMSC29 and DMSC23 [derived from placental chorionic villi (CMSCs) and decidua basalis (DMSCs), respectively], were used to prepare dECM-coated substrates. These dECM substrates showed structural and biochemical differences. Primary DMSCs cultured on dECM-DMSC23 showed a three-fold increase in cell number after 14 days expansion in culture and increased osteogenic differentiation compared with controls. Primary CMSCs cultured on the dECM-DMSC23 exhibited a two-fold increase in cell number and increased osteogenic differentiation. We conclude that immortal MSC cell lines derived from different parts of the placenta produce dECM with varying abilities for supporting increased primary MSC expansion while maintaining important primary MSC properties. Additionally, this is the first demonstration of using high passage number cells to produce dECM that can promote primary MSC expansion, and this advancement greatly increases the feasibility and applicability of dECM-based technologies."
https://openalex.org/W2584364866,"Fasciolosis an economically important global disease of ruminants in the temperate and tropical regions, caused by Fasciola hepatica and F. gigantica, respectively, also poses a potential zoonotic threat. In India alone it causes huge losses to stakeholders. Anthelmintics including triclabendazole have been used to control this menace but the emerging resistance against the available compounds necessitates identification of novel and alternative therapeutic measures involving plant derived natural compounds for their anthelmintic potential. Thymoquinone (T) and curcumin (C), the active ingredients of Nigella sativa and Curcuma longa respectively have been used as antiparasitic agents but the information on their flukicidal effect is very limited. Adult flukes of F. gigantica were in vitro exposed to different concentrations of thymoquinone and curcumin separately for 3h at 37+ 1°C. A significant (p<0.05) reduction in the worm motility at 60 μM concentration of both T and C was observed though all the worms remained alive after 3h exposure, whereas the effect on egg shedding was statistically insignificant. Pronounced tegumental disruptions and erosion of spines in the posterior region and around the acetabulum was evident. A significant (p<0.05) decrease in glutathione-S-transferase and superoxide dismutase activity and reduced glutathione (GSH) level was observed, while protein carbonylation increased differentially. A significant inhibition of CathepsinL (CatL) gene expression in thymoquinone treated worms was also evident. Further, in silico molecular docking of T and C with CatL revealed a stronger interaction of curcumin with the involvement of higher number of amino acids as compared to thymoquinone that could be more effective in inhibiting the antioxidant enzymes of F. gigantica. It is concluded that both the compounds understudy will decrease the detoxification ability of F. gigantica, while inhibition of CatL will significantly affect their virulence potential. Thus, both thymoquinone and curcumin appeared to be promising anthelmintic compounds for further investigations."
https://openalex.org/W2224454245,"We present a theoretical analysis of Gaussian-binary restricted Boltzmann machines (GRBMs) from the perspective of density models. The key aspect of this analysis is to show that GRBMs can be formulated as a constrained mixture of Gaussians, which gives a much better insight into the model’s capabilities and limitations. We further show that GRBMs are capable of learning meaningful features without using a regularization term and that the results are comparable to those of independent component analysis. This is illustrated for both a two-dimensional blind source separation task and for modeling natural image patches. Our findings exemplify that reported difficulties in training GRBMs are due to the failure of the training algorithm rather than the model itself. Based on our analysis we derive a better training setup and show empirically that it leads to faster and more robust training of GRBMs. Finally, we compare different sampling algorithms for training GRBMs and show that Contrastive Divergence performs better than training methods that use a persistent Markov chain."
https://openalex.org/W2584666484,"Fungal cell walls contain β-glucan polysaccharides that stimulate immune responses when recognized by host immune cells. The fungal pathogen Histoplasma capsulatum minimizes detection of β-glucan by host cells through at least two mechanisms: concealment of β-glucans beneath α-glucans and enzymatic removal of any exposed β-glucan polysaccharides by the secreted glucanase Eng1. Histoplasma yeasts also secrete the putative glucanase Exg8, which may serve a similar role as Eng1 in removing exposed β-glucans from the yeast cell surface. Here, we characterize the enzymatic specificity of the Eng1 and Exg8 proteins and show that Exg8 is an exo-β1,3-glucanase and Eng1 is an endo-β1,3-glucanase. Together, Eng1 and Exg8 account for nearly all of the total secreted glucanase activity of Histoplasma yeasts. Both Eng1 and Exg8 proteins are secreted through a conventional secretion signal and are modified post-translationally by O-linked glycosylation. Both glucanases have near maximal activity at temperature and pH conditions experienced during infection of host cells, supporting roles in Histoplasma pathogenesis. Exg8 has a higher specific activity than Eng1 for β1,3-glucans; yet despite this, Exg8 does not reduce detection of yeasts by the host β-glucan receptor Dectin-1. Exg8 is largely dispensable for virulence in vivo, in contrast to Eng1. These results show that Histoplasma yeasts secrete two β1,3-glucanases and that Eng1 endoglucanase activity is the predominant factor responsible for removal of exposed cell wall β-glucans to minimize host detection of Histoplasma yeasts."
https://openalex.org/W2584779815,"Accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is an important pathogenic mechanism underling the loss of bone mass and strength with aging and other conditions leading to osteoporosis. The transcription factor erythroid 2-related factor2 (Nrf2) plays a central role in activating the cellular response to ROS. Here, we examined the endogenous response of bone regulated by Nrf2, and its relationship with bone mass and architecture in the male and female murine skeleton. Young (3 month-old) and old (15 month-old) Nrf2 knockout (KO) mice of either sex exhibited the expected reduction in Nrf2 mRNA expression compared to wild type (WT) littermates. Nrf2 deletion did not lead to compensatory increase in Nrf1 or Nrf3, other members of this transcription factor family; and instead, Nrf1 expression was lower in KO mice. Compared to the respective WT littermate controls, female KO mice, young and old, exhibited lower expression of both detoxifying and antioxidant enzymes; young male KO mice, displayed lower expression of detoxifying enzymes but not antioxidant enzymes; and old male KO mice showed no differences in either detoxifying or antioxidant enzymes. Moreover, old male WT mice exhibited lower Nrf2 levels, and consequently lower expression of both detoxifying and antioxidant enzymes, compared to old female WT mice. These endogenous antioxidant responses lead to delayed rate of bone acquisition in female KO mice and higher bone acquisition in male KO mice as quantified by DXA and μCT, demonstrating that Nrf2 is required for full bone accrual in the female skeleton but unnecessary and even detrimental in the male skeleton. Therefore, Nrf2 regulates the antioxidant endogenous response and bone accrual differently depending on sex and age. These findings suggest that therapeutic interventions that target Nrf2 could be developed to enhance the endogenous antioxidant response in a sex- and age-selective manner."
https://openalex.org/W2584816264,"Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the sixth and fourth most common cause of cancer death in men worldwide and in Taiwan, respectively. AURKA, which encodes a centrosome-related serine/threonine kinase, is frequently amplified and overexpressed in many human cancers, particularly advanced OSCC. We conducted a hospital-based case-control study to estimate AURKA single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and environmental risk factors to determine OSCC susceptibility and clinicopathological characteristics.We enrolled a total of 876 OSCC patients and 1200 controls. Four SNPs of AURKA, namely rs1047972, rs2273535, rs2064863, and rs6024836, were analyzed using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Among the 1420 smokers, the AURKA polymorphism carriers with the betel nut chewing habit had a higher risk of oral cancer than AURKA wild-type (WT) carriers without the betel nut chewing habit. Patients with the AURKA rs2064863 gene had a 1.365-fold higher risk of stage III or IV OSCC (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.029-1.811) than those with the rs2064863 WT gene. Furthermore, carriers of the AURKA rs1047972/rs2273535/rs2064863 C-A-T haplotype had a 1.736-fold (95% CI 1.110-2.715) higher risk of OSCC than controls (C-T-T, the most common haplotype). Among patients with the betel quid chewing habit, carriers of other haplotypes (C-T-T, C-A-G, T-A-T, T-A-G, T-T-T, and C-T-G) had a 12.857-fold (95% CI 10.731-15.404) increased risk, and carriers of the C-A-T haplotype had the highest risk (AOR: 31.120; 95% CI 13.864-69.850) of OSCC, compared with those without the betel quid chewing who harbored other haplotypes.In conclusion, betel nut chewing combined with the AURKA C-A-T haplotypes lead to a high risk of OSCC. These findings reveal a novel genetic-environmental predisposition for oral tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2584418414,"Invariant NKT (iNKT) cells can be activated to stimulate a broad inflammatory response. In murine models of sickle cell disease (SCD), interruption of iNKT cell activity prevents tissue injury from vaso-occlusion. NKTT120 is an anti-iNKT cell monoclonal antibody that has the potential to rapidly and specifically deplete iNKT cells and, potentially, prevent vaso-occlusion. We conducted an open-label, multi-center, single-ascending-dose study of NKTT120 to determine its pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and safety in steady-state patients with SCD. Doses were escalated in a 3+3 study design over a range from 0.001 mg/kg to 1.0 mg/kg. Twenty-one adults with SCD were administered NKTT120 as part of 7 dose cohorts. Plasma levels of NKTT120 predictably increased with higher doses. Median half-life of NKTT120 was 263 hours. All subjects in the higher dose cohorts (0.1 mg/kg, 0.3 mg/kg, and 1 mg/kg) demonstrated decreased iNKT cells below the lower limit of quantification within 6 hours after infusion, the earliest time point at which they were measured. In those subjects who received the two highest doses of NKTT120 (0.3, 1 mg/kg), iNKT cells were not detectable in the peripheral blood for a range of 2 to 5 months. There were no serious adverse events in the study deemed to be related to NKTT120. In adults with SCD, NKTT120 produced rapid, specific and sustained iNKT cell depletion without any infusional toxicity or attributed serious adverse events. The next step is a trial to determine NKTT120’s ability to decrease rate of vaso-occlusive pain episodes. Trial Registration: clinicaltrials.gov NCT01783691."
https://openalex.org/W2585392292,"The aim of this study was to investigate the ability of hinokitiol to inhibit the formation of Candida biofilms. Biofilm inhibition was evaluated by quantification of the biofilm metabolic activity with XTT assay. Hinokitiol efficiently prevented biofilm formation in both fluconazole-susceptible and fluconazole-resistant strains of Candida species. We determined the expression levels of specific genes previously implicated in biofilm development of C. albicans cells by real-time RT-PCR. The expression levels of genes associated with adhesion process, HWP1 and ALS3, were downregulated by hinokitiol. Transcript levels of UME6 and HGC1, responsible for long-term hyphal maintenance, were also decreased by hinokitiol. The expression level of CYR1, which encodes the component of signaling pathway of hyphal formation-cAMP-PKA was suppressed by hinokitiol. Its upstream general regulator RAS1 was also suppressed by hinokitiol. These results indicate that hinokitiol may have therapeutic potential in the treatment and prevention of biofilm-associated Candida infections."

The visiting hours and behavior of floral visitors in the floral chamber were recorded, as were the sites of oviposition. Excavations were undertaken around specimens of A. coriacea to determine the location of immature pollinators. Anthesis was nocturnal, starting at sunset, and lasted for 52-56 h. The flowers were bisexual, protogynous and emitted a strong scent similar to the plant´s own ripe fruit. There was pronounced synchrony among all floral events (the period and duration of stigmatic receptivity, release of odor, pollen release and drooping flowers) in different individuals, but no synchrony in the same individuals. All of the flowers monitored were visited by beetle species of the genera Cyclocephala and Arriguttia. Beetles arrived at the flowers with their bodies covered in pollen and these pollen grains were transferred to the stigmata while foraging on nutritious tissues at the base of the petals. With dehiscence of the stamens and retention within the floral chamber, the bodies of the floral visitors were again covered with pollen which they carried to newly opened flowers, thus promoting the cycle of pollination. After leaving the flowers, female beetles often excavated holes in the soil to lay eggs. Larvae were found between the leaf litter and the first layer of soil under specimens of A. coriacea. Cyclocephala beetles were the main pollinators of A. coriacea, but Arriguttia brevissima was also considered a pollinator and is the first species of this genus to be observed in Annonaceae flowers. Annona coriacea was found to be self-compatible with a low reproductive efficiency in the area studied. The results of this investigation provide ecological data that should contribute to the conservation and economic exploitation of A. coriacea."
https://openalex.org/W2583659714,"Serum response factor (SRF) transcriptionally regulates expression of contractile genes in smooth muscle cells (SMC). Lack or decrease of SRF is directly linked to a phenotypic change of SMC, leading to hypomotility of smooth muscle in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. However, the molecular mechanism behind SRF-induced hypomotility in GI smooth muscle is largely unknown. We describe here how SRF plays a functional role in the regulation of the SMC contractility via myotonic dystrophy protein kinase (DMPK) and L-type calcium channel CACNA1C. GI SMC expressed Dmpk and Cacna1c genes into multiple alternative transcriptional isoforms. Deficiency of SRF in SMC of Srf knockout (KO) mice led to reduction of SRF-dependent DMPK, which down-regulated the expression of CACNA1C. Reduction of CACNA1C in KO SMC not only decreased intracellular Ca2+ spikes but also disrupted their coupling between cells resulting in decreased contractility. The role of SRF in the regulation of SMC phenotype and function provides new insight into how SMC lose their contractility leading to hypomotility in pathophysiological conditions within the GI tract."

This paper aimed to investigate cytokeratin-14 (CK14) expression and analyze its association with collective invasion in the invasive front of salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma (SACC) to uncover the role of collective invasion in SACC. Here, in the clinical data of 121 patients with SACC, the positive expression of CK14 was observed in 35/121(28.93%) of the invasive front of SACC. CK14 expression in the invasive front, local regional recurrence and distant metastasis were independent and significant prognostic factors in SACC patients. Then, we found that in an ex vivo 3D culture assay, CK14 siRNA receded the collective invasion, and in 2D monolayer culture, CK14 overexpression induced a collective SACC cell migration. These data indicated that the presence of characterized CK14+ cells in the invasive front of SACC promoted collective cell invasion of SACC and may be a biomarker of SACC with a worse prognosis."

Methods High quality PAFD and RNFLT images acquired on the same day with the Angiovue/RTVue-XR Avanti OCT (Optovue Inc., Fremont, USA) on 1 eye of 27 stable early-to-moderate glaucoma, 22 medically controlled ocular hypertensive and 13 healthy participants were analyzed. Octopus G2 normal visual field test was made within 3 months from the imaging. Results Total peripapillary PAFD and RNFLT showed similar strong positive correlation with global mean sensitivity (r-values: 0.6710 and 0.6088, P<0.0001), and similar (P = 0.9614) strong negative correlation (r-values: -0.4462 and -0.4412, P≤0.004) with global MD. Both inferotemporal and superotemporal sector PAFD were significantly (≤0.039) lower in glaucoma than in the other groups. No significant difference between the corresponding inferotemporal and superotemporal parameters was seen. The coefficient of determination (R2) calculated for the relationship between inferotemporal sector PAFD and superotemporal cluster MD (0.5141, P<0.0001) was significantly greater than that between inferotemporal sector RNFLT and superotemporal cluster MD (0.2546, P = 0.0001). The R2 values calculated for the relationships between superotemporal sector PAFD and RNFLT, and inferotemporal cluster MD were similar (0.3747 and 0.4037, respectively, P<0.0001). Conclusion In the current population the relationship between inferotemporal sector PAFD and superotemporal cluster MD was strong. It was stronger than that between inferotemporal sector RNFLT and superotemporal cluster MD. Further investigations are necessary to clarify if our results are valid for other populations and can be usefully applied for glaucoma research."
https://openalex.org/W2584831625,"Recently, myriapods have attracted the attention of engineers because mobile robots that mimic them potentially have the capability of producing highly stable, adaptive, and resilient behaviors. The major challenge here is to develop a control scheme that can coordinate their numerous legs in real time, and an autonomous decentralized control could be the key to solve this problem. Therefore, we focus on real centipedes and aim to design a decentralized control scheme for myriapod robots by drawing inspiration from behavioral experiments on centipede locomotion under unusual conditions. In the behavioral experiments, we observed the response to the removal of a part of the terrain and to amputation of several legs. Further, we determined that the ground reaction force is significant for generating rhythmic leg movements; the motion of each leg is likely affected by a sensory input from its neighboring legs. Thus, we constructed a two-dimensional model wherein a simple local reflexive mechanism was implemented in each leg. We performed simulations by using this model and demonstrated that the myriapod robot could move adaptively to changes in the environment and body properties. Our findings will shed new light on designing adaptive and resilient myriapod robots that can function under various circumstances."
https://openalex.org/W2585349626,"Although there is a great wealth of data supporting the occurrence of simultaneous synthesis and breakdown of storage carbohydrate in many organisms, previous 13CO2 pulse-chase based studies indicated that starch degradation does not operate in illuminated Arabidopsis leaves. Here we show that leaves of gwd, sex4, bam4, bam1/bam3 and amy3/isa3/lda starch breakdown mutants accumulate higher levels of starch than wild type (WT) leaves when cultured under continuous light (CL) conditions. We also show that leaves of CL grown dpe1 plants impaired in the plastidic disproportionating enzyme accumulate higher levels of maltotriose than WT leaves, the overall data providing evidence for the occurrence of extensive starch degradation in illuminated leaves. Moreover, we show that leaves of CL grown mex1/pglct plants impaired in the chloroplastic maltose and glucose transporters display a severe dwarf phenotype and accumulate high levels of maltose, strongly indicating that the MEX1 and pGlcT transporters are involved in the export of starch breakdown products to the cytosol to support growth during illumination. To investigate whether starch breakdown products can be recycled back to starch during illumination through a mechanism involving ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGP) we conducted kinetic analyses of the stable isotope carbon composition (δ13C) in starch of leaves of 13CO2 pulsed-chased WT and AGP lacking aps1 plants. Notably, the rate of increase of δ13C in starch of aps1 leaves during the pulse was exceedingly higher than that of WT leaves. Furthermore, δ13C decline in starch of aps1 leaves during the chase was much faster than that of WT leaves, which provides strong evidence for the occurrence of AGP-mediated cycling of starch breakdown products in illuminated Arabidopsis leaves."
https://openalex.org/W2585834450,"Background Permanent joint dysfunction due to bone destruction occurs in up to 50% of patients with septic arthritis. Recently, imaging technologies such as micro computed tomography (μCT) scan have been widely used for preclinical models of autoimmune joint disorders. However, the radiological features of septic arthritis in mice are still largely unknown. Methods NMRI mice were intravenously or intra-articularly inoculated with S. aureus Newman or LS-1 strain. The radiological and clinical signs of septic arthritis were followed for 10 days using μCT. We assessed the correlations between joint radiological changes and clinical signs, histological changes, and serum levels of cytokines. Results On days 5–7 after intravenous infection, bone destruction verified by μCT became evident in most of the infected joints. Radiological signs of bone destruction were dependent on the bacterial dose. The site most commonly affected by septic arthritis was the distal femur in knees. The bone destruction detected by μCT was positively correlated with histological changes in both local and hematogenous septic arthritis. The serum levels of IL-6 were significantly correlated with the severity of joint destruction. Conclusion μCT is a sensitive method for monitoring disease progression and determining the severity of bone destruction in a mouse model of septic arthritis. IL-6 may be used as a biomarker for bone destruction in septic arthritis."
https://openalex.org/W2584756254,"Purpose The role of exercise to prevent or reverse aging-induced cognitive decline has been widely reported. This neuroprotection is associated with changes in the synaptic structure plasticity. However, the mechanisms of exercise-induced synaptic plasticity in the aging brain are still unclear. Thus, the aim of the present study is to investigate the aging-related alterations of Rho-GTPase and the modulatory influences of exercise training. Methods Young and old rats were used in this study. Old rats were subjected to different schedules of aerobic exercise (12 m/min, 60 min/d, 3d/w or 5d/w) or kept sedentary for 12 w. After 12 w of aerobic exercise, the synapse density in the cortex and hippocampus was detected with immunofluorescent staining using synaptophysin as a marker. The total protein levels of RhoA, Rac1, Cdc42 and cofilin in the cortex and hippocampus were detected with Western Blot. The activities of RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42 were determined using a pull down assay. Results We found that synapse loss occurred in aging rats. However, the change of expression and activity of RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42 was different in the cortex and hippocampus. In the cortex, the expression and activity of Rac1 and Cdc42 was greatly increased with aging, whereas there were no changes in the expression and activity of RhoA. In the hippocampus, the expression and activity of Rac1 and Cdc42 was greatly decreased and there were no changes in the expression and activity of RhoA. As a major downstream substrate of the Rho GTPase family, the increased expression of cofilin was only observed in the cortex. High frequency exercise ameliorated all aging-related changes in the cortex and hippocampus. Conclusions These data suggest that aerobic exercise reverses synapse loss in the cortex and hippocampus in aging rats, which might be related to the regulation of Rho GTPases."
https://openalex.org/W2585828244,"Identifying the targets of antibody responses during infection is important for designing vaccines, developing diagnostic and prognostic tools, and understanding pathogenesis. We developed a novel deep sequence-coupled biopanning approach capable of identifying the protein epitopes of antibodies present in human polyclonal serum. Here, we report the adaptation of this approach for the identification of pathogen-specific epitopes recognized by antibodies elicited during acute infection. As a proof-of-principle, we applied this approach to assessing antibodies to Dengue virus (DENV). Using a panel of sera from patients with acute secondary DENV infection, we panned a DENV antigen fragment library displayed on the surface of bacteriophage MS2 virus-like particles and characterized the population of affinity-selected peptide epitopes by deep sequence analysis. Although there was considerable variation in the responses of individuals, we found several epitopes within the Envelope glycoprotein and Non-Structural Protein 1 that were commonly enriched. This report establishes a novel approach for characterizing pathogen-specific antibody responses in human sera, and has future utility in identifying novel diagnostic and vaccine targets."

Specifically, caspase-6 has also been implicated in playing a unique and critical role in neurodegeneration; however, structural similarities between caspase-6 and other caspase active sites have hampered precise targeting of caspase-6. All caspases can exist in a canonical conformation, in which the substrate binds atop a α-strand platform in the 130’s region. This caspase-6 region can also adopt a helical conformation that has not been seen in any other caspases. Understanding the dynamics and interconversion between the helical and strand conformations in caspase-6 is critical to fully assess its unique function and regulation. Here, hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry indicated that caspase-6 is inherently and dramatically more conformationally dynamic than closely related caspase-7. In contrast to caspase-7, which rests constitutively in the strand conformation before and after substrate binding, the hydrogen/deuterium exchange data in the L2′ and 130’s regions suggested that before substrate binding, caspase-6 exists in a dynamic equilibrium between the helix and strand conformations. Caspase-6 transitions exclusively to the canonical strand conformation only upon substrate binding. Glu-135, which showed noticeably different calculated pKa values in the helix and strand conformations, appears to play a key role in the interconversion between the helix and strand conformations.

For example, the TRPP2-PKD1 complex has a crucial function in renal physiology, with mutations in either protein causing autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. In contrast, the TRPP3-PKD1L3 complex responds to low pH and was proposed to be a sour taste receptor candidate. It has been shown previously that the protein partners interact via association of the C-terminal or transmembrane segments, with consequences for the assembly, surface expression, and function of the polycystin complexes. However, the roles of extracellular components, especially the loops that connect the transmembrane segments, in the assembly and function of the polycystin complex are largely unknown. Here, with an immunoprecipitation method, we found that extracellular loops between the first and second transmembrane segments of TRPP2 and TRPP3 associate with the extracellular loops between the sixth and seventh transmembrane segments of PKD1 and PKD1L3, respectively. Immunofluorescence and electrophysiology data further confirm that the associations between these loops are essential for the trafficking and function of the complexes. Interestingly, most of the extracellular loops are also found to be involved in homomeric assembly. Furthermore, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease-associated TRPP2 mutant T448K significantly weakened TRPP2 homomeric assembly but had no obvious effect on TRPP2-PKD1 heteromeric assembly.

Further evidence showed that the coiled-coil domains from three TRPP2 subunits form a tightly bundled trimer in both solution and protein crystal (28.Molland K.L. Narayanan A. Burgner J.W.

The downstream region of this trimer forms the PKD1-binding site and binds to one copy of the C-terminal coiled-coil domain of PKD1, determining a 3:1 (TRPP2/PKD1) subunit stoichiometry of the full-length complex (29.Yu Y.

Although several other domains and amino acids were found to be involved in TRPP2 homomeric assembly (31.Feng S. Rodat-Despoix L. Delmas P. Ong A.C. A single amino acid residue constitutes the third dimerization domain essential for the assembly and function of the tetrameric polycystin-2 (TRPP2) channel.J. Biol.

The association between TRPP3 and PKD1L3 differs from that of TRPP2 and PKD1. Since PKD1L3 lacks the C-terminal coiled-coil domain (33.Li A. Tian X. Sung S.W. Somlo S. Identification of two novel polycystic kidney disease-1-like genes in human and mouse genomes.Genomics. 2003; 81: 596-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), the C-terminal interaction may not exist in the TRPP3-PKD1L3 complex. Instead, the transmembrane domains of TRPP3 and PKD1L3 were shown to mediate their association (34.Ishimaru Y. Katano Y. Yamamoto K. Akiba M. Misaka T. Roberts R.W. Asakura T. Matsunami H. Abe K.

PKD and TRPP proteins have unique extracellular components in their structures. TRPP proteins have a large extracellular loop located between the first and the second transmembrane domains (S1-S2 loop), which has 224 amino acids in human TRPP2 (5.Mochizuki T. Wu G. Hayashi T.

As for the PKD proteins, besides the long extracellular N terminus (>3000 amino acids in human PKD1), they all have a relatively large extracellular loop between the sixth and seventh transmembrane domains (S6-S7 loop), which is composed of 211 amino acids in human PKD1 (7.Hughes J.

Considering the fact that the last six transmembrane domains of PKD proteins have sequence similarity with the six transmembrane domains of TRPP proteins, the S1-S2 loop of TRPP and the S6-S7 loop of PKD are located at homologous positions (Fig. 1, A and B). Many ADPKD pathogenic mutations are located in these loops (ADPKD Mutation Database), indicating a notable role of this loop in TRPP2 structure and function. Despite their large size and potential functional importance, very little was known about these extracellular loops until recently. During the preparation of this paper, three TRPP2 cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures were reported (9.Shen P.S. Yang X. DeCaen P.G. Liu X. Bulkley D. Clapham D.E. Cao E.

From these structures, it can be seen that the TRPP2 extracellular loops are involved in the homomeric assembly of the TRPP2 channel and may also be important for ion permeability and channel function regulation (9.Shen P.S. Yang X. DeCaen P.G. Liu X. Bulkley D. Clapham D.E. Cao E.

In this study, we hypothesized that TRPP and PKD proteins also associate through extracellular loops and tested this hypothesis with biochemical and biophysical methods, using the TRPP2-PKD1 and TRPP3-PKD1L3 complexes as model molecules. Our results indicate that the S1-S2 loop of the TRPP proteins and the S6-S7 loop of the PKD proteins bind to each other and play an essential role in the assembly and function of the polycystin complexes. To eliminate the interference of other regions and to mimic their native localization, we expressed the isolated loop fragments on the extracellular side of the plasma membrane and kept it tethered to the membrane. The DNA constructs were made by cloning the cDNA of the loop fragments into the pDisplay vector (Invitrogen). Proteins expressed in this vector have an Ig κ-chain leader sequence fused to the N terminus, which directs the protein to the secretory pathway, and a platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) transmembrane domain fused to the C terminus, which anchors the protein to the plasma membrane (Fig. 1C). An HA tag is inserted between the Ig κ-chain leader sequence and the TRPP2 (or TRPP3) loop fragment. Similarly, a FLAG tag is placed between the Ig κ-chain leader sequence and the PKD1 (or PKD1L3) loop fragment (Fig. 1C). As a signal peptide, the Ig κ-chain leader sequence will be cleaved from the N terminus after expression, and the HA or FLAG tag will be exposed for detection. The expression of the recombinant proteins on the extracellular surface of the plasma membrane was then confirmed by the immunofluorescence experiment (37.Lam C. Pavel M.A. Kashyap P. Salehi-Najafabadi Z. Valentino V. Yu Y. Detection of CXCR2 cytokine receptor surface expression using immunofluorescence.Methods Mol. Biol. 2014; 1172: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). When either TRPP2 S1-S2 and PKD1 S6-S7 loops or TRPP3 S1-S2 and PKD1L3 S6-S7 loops were coexpressed in HEK 293T cells, we detected cell surface expression of both pairs of proteins (Fig. 1D). These results set the basis of our further tests. We then tested the association between TRPP S1-S2 loops and PKD S6-S7 loops with the co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) method. All loop proteins migrate to the 40–50 kDa range on the SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 2). When expressed in HEK 293T cells, the HA-TRPP2 loop was immunoprecipitated by anti-FLAG antibody only when the FLAG-PKD1 loop was present (Fig. 2A, lanes 1–3 in both the top and bottom gels), indicating the association between the two loops. This result was further verified by using anti-HA antibody in co-IP. The FLAG-PKD1 loop was immunoprecipitated together with the HA-TRPP2 loop, which only happens when both proteins are coexpressed (Fig. 2A, lanes 4–6). It is worth noting that the TRPP2 loop gave another weak band with the size of about 100–120 kDa (Fig. 2A, labeled with asterisks). We also observed similar bands for other loops in some of the following experiments. Judging from the molecular weight, these bands most likely represent dimers of the loop proteins that were not completely separated by SDS treatment. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the loops form complexes with endogenously expressed proteins. The homomeric assembly of the loops was tested later in Fig. 3.FIGURE 3Homomeric association between the extracellular loops. Co-IP followed by Western blotting (IB) shows the homomeric interaction between the FLAG- and HA-tagged TRPP2 loops (lanes 2 and 6 of the top two gels), the FLAG- and HA-tagged PKD1L3 loops (lanes 3 and 7 of the top two gels), and the FLAG- and HA-tagged TRPP3 loops (lanes 4 and 8 of the top two gels). However, the FLAG-PKD1 loop was not immunoprecipitated with the HA-PKD1 loop (lanes 1 and 5 of the top two gels), although it expressed well in cells, as can be seen in the flow-through sample (lane 5 in the bottom gel). Co-IP was done with the anti-HA antibody-coated beads.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Similar results were obtained when co-IP was done between the S1-S2 loop of TRPP3 and the S6-S7 loop of PKD1L3 (Fig. 2B). With either anti-FLAG (Fig. 2B, lanes 1–3) or anti-HA antibody (Fig. 2B, lanes 4–6), the HA-TRPP3 loop and the FLAG-PKD1L3 loop were co-immunoprecipitated only when both proteins were coexpressed. The data in Fig. 2 suggest that the association between the extracellular S1-S2 loop of TRPP proteins and the S6-S7 loop of PKD proteins may be common within the complexes formed between these two families. To test the specificity of the loop association, we used the enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) as the negative control to replace the PKD loops in the co-IP experiments. When FLAG-EGFP was coexpressed with the HA-TRPP2 loop or the HA-TRPP3 loop, it was not co-immunoprecipitated with either HA-tagged loop protein (Fig. 2C, lanes 1 and 2), although it was expressed well in the cells, as seen in flow-through samples (Fig. 2C, lanes 3 and 4). These results indicate that the S1-S2 loops of TRPP proteins associate with the S6-S7 loops of their PKD partners. Both the TRPP2-PKD1 and TRPP3-PKD1L3 complexes consist of three TRPP subunits and one PKD subunit (25.Yu Y. Ulbrich M.H. Li M.H. Dobbins S. Zhang W.K. Tong L. Isacoff E.Y. Yang J.

To explore regulatory impacts of these variants we conducted expression quantitative loci (eQTL) analyses on tissue samples from 376 invasive postmenopausal breast cancer cases in the Nurses' Health Study (NHS) diagnosed from 1990-2004. Expression analysis was conducted on all formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples (and on 264 adjacent normal samples) using the Affymetrix Human Transcriptome Array. Significance and ranking of associations between tumor receptor status and expression variation was preserved between NHS FFPE and TCGA fresh-frozen sample sets (Spearman r = 0.85, p<10^-10 for 17 of the 21 Oncotype DX recurrence signature genes). At an FDR threshold of 10%, we identified 27 trans-eQTLs associated with expression variation in 217 distinct genes. SNP-gene associations can be explored using an open-source interactive browser distributed in a Bioconductor package. Using a new a procedure for testing hypotheses relating SNP content to expression patterns in gene sets, defined as molecular function pathways, we find that loci on 6q14 and 6q25 affect various gene sets and molecular pathways (FDR < 10%). Although the ultimate biological interpretation of the GWAS-identified variants remains to be uncovered, this study validates the utility of expression analysis of this FFPE expression set for more detailed integrative analyses."

A total of 1806 HIV-1 protease-reverse transcriptase (PR/RT) sequences from different patients were obtained in the CV between 2004 and 2014. After subtyping and generating a phylogenetic tree with additional HIV-1 subtype B sequences, a very large transmission cluster which included almost exclusively sequences from the CV was detected (n = 143 patients). This cluster was then validated and characterized with further maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analyses and Bayesian coalescent reconstructions. With these analyses, the CV cluster was delimited to 113 patients, predominately men who have sex with men (MSM). Although it was significantly located in the city of Valencia (n = 105), phylogenetic analyses suggested this cluster derives from a larger HIV lineage affecting other Spanish localities (n = 194). Coalescent analyses estimated its expansion in Valencia to have started between 1998 and 2004. From 2004 to 2009, members of this cluster represented only 1.46% of the HIV-1 subtype B samples studied in Valencia (n = 5/143), whereas from 2010 onwards its prevalence raised to 12.64% (n = 100/791). In conclusion, we have detected a very large transmission cluster in the CV where it has experienced a very fast growth in the recent years in the city of Valencia, thus contributing significantly to the HIV epidemic in this locality. Its transmission efficiency evidences shortcomings in HIV control measures in Spain and particularly in Valencia."
https://openalex.org/W2583554723,"Friedel–Crafts alkylation of aromatic systems is a classic reaction in organic chemistry, for which regiospecific mono-alkylation, however, is generally difficult to achieve. In nature, methyltransferases catalyze the addition of methyl groups to a wide range of biomolecules thereby modulating the physico-chemical properties of these compounds. Specifically, S-adenosyl-L-methionine dependent C-methyltransferases possess a high potential to serve as biocatalysts in environmentally benign organic syntheses. Here, we report on the high resolution crystal structure of CouO, a C-methyltransferase from Streptomyces rishiriensis involved in the biosynthesis of the antibiotic coumermycin A1. Through molecular docking calculations, site-directed mutagenesis and the comparison with homologous enzymes we identified His120 and Arg121 as key functional residues for the enzymatic activity of this group of C-methyltransferases. The elucidation of the atomic structure and the insight into the catalytic mechanism provide the basis for the (semi)-rational engineering of the enzyme in order to increase the substrate scope as well as to facilitate the acceptance of SAM-analogues as alternative cofactors."

In this study we assessed the iron and vitamin A status of schoolchildren and the association between vitamin A and iron status.A cross-sectional design using the baseline data of a dietary intervention trial conducted among randomly selected 5-12 years old schoolchildren (n = 224) from 2 rural schools in northern Ghana. Hemoglobin (Hb), serum ferritin (SF) and serum transferrin receptor (sTfR) concentrations were used as measures of iron status. Retinol binding protein (RBP) was used as a measure of vitamin A status. Subclinical inflammation (SCI) was measured using C-reactive protein (CRP) and α1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) concentrations. We examined the cross-sectional association between vitamin A and iron status biomarkers with multiple linear regressions.The proportions of schoolchildren with anemia (WHO criteria), iron-deficiency (ID, SF <15μg/l and/or sTfR >8.5mg/l) and iron-deficiency anemia (IDA, concurrent anemia and ID) were 63.8%, 68.3% and 46.4% respectively. Low or marginal vitamin A status (0.70 μmol/l ≤ RBP < 1.05μmol/l) was present in 48.2% while 37.5% of the schoolchildren had vitamin A deficiency (VAD, RBP <0.70 μmol/l). The prevalence of SCI as well as concurrent VAD and ID were 48.7% and 25% respectively. RBP was associated with Hb (β = 7.2, P = 0.05) but not SF (β = 20.7, P = 0.33) and sTfR concentration (β = 12.0, P = 0.63). In the presence of SCI, RBP was not associated with hemoglobin status but a significant positive association was observed among children without SCI.The study shows that RBP is significantly associated with Hb concentration but not with SF and sTfR. The observed relationship between RBP and Hb is only significant in the absence of SCI."

Moreover, compounds 2b, 3e and 12e were tested for their activity in human skin biopsies. They were able to prevent, at least in part, both the cortisone- and the UV-mediated decreases in collagen content. Thus, inhibition of 11β-HSD1 by these compounds can be further investigated to delay or prevent UV-mediated skin damage and skin aging."
https://openalex.org/W2583101669,"Nearly all living systems feature a temperature-independent oscillation period in circadian clocks. This ubiquitous property occurs at the system level and is rooted in the network architecture of the clock machinery. To investigate the mechanism of this prominent property of the circadian clock and provide general guidance for generating robust genetic oscillators with temperature-compensated oscillations, we theoretically explored the design principle and core network topologies preferred by oscillations with a temperature-independent period. By enumerating all topologies of genetic regulatory circuits with three genes, we obtained four network motifs, namely, a delayed negative feedback oscillator, repressilator, activator-inhibitor oscillator and substrate-depletion oscillator; hybrids of these motifs constitute the vast majority of target network topologies. These motifs are biased in their capacities for achieving oscillations and the temperature sensitivity of the period. The delayed negative feedback oscillator and repressilator are more robust for oscillations, whereas the activator-inhibitor and substrate-depletion oscillators are superior for maintaining a temperature-independent oscillation period. These results suggest that thermally robust oscillation can be more plausibly achieved by hybridizing these two categories of network motifs. Antagonistic balance and temperature insulation mechanisms for achieving temperature compensation are typically found in these topologies with temperature robustness. In the temperature insulation approach, the oscillation period relies on very few parameters, and these parameters are influenced only slightly by temperature. This approach prevents the temperature from affecting the oscillation period and generates circadian rhythms that are robust against environmental perturbations."
https://openalex.org/W2584690879,"Background The recollections of survivors of breast cancer are an important source of information about the disease for their family, friends, and newly diagnosed patients. So far, little is known about these memories. This study investigated how accurately survivors of breast cancer remember their past quality of life (QoL) during the disease and if this memory is modified by women`s present QoL and negative affect. Material and methods The longitudinal population-based study included 133 survivors of breast cancer (response rate 80%). Participants were asked for their present QoL and to recall their baseline QoL (EORTC QLQ-C30, QLQ-BR23) that had been assessed about seven years ago before discharge from hospital. The dependent variable was recall bias in ten QoL dimensions. Present QoL and negative affect (PANAS) were investigated as predictor variables. Results Overall, baseline QoL was retrospectively underrated on seven out of ten scales whereas no significant overestimation was found. In multiple linear regression analyses, controlling for confounders, a stronger underrating of QoL was significantly predicted by a lower present QoL on nine out of ten scales and by higher negative affect on six scales. Conclusions Survivors of breast cancer tend to underestimate their past QoL during the disease when asked about seven years later. Lower present QoL and higher negative affect contribute to this recall bias. This needs to be considered when interpreting retrospectively reported QoL data. Results are discussed in relation to theory of change or stability and mood congruency theory."

Lines of A. thaliana over-expressing purple acid phosphatase 2 (AtPAP2) (OE lines) contain increased levels of ATP and sucrose, with improved growth rate and seed production. Compared to wild type (WT) and pap2 lines, the OE lines were more susceptible to several Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst) strains carrying AvrRpm1, AvrRpt2 AvrRps4, AvrPtoB, HrcC and WT strain DC3000. The increased susceptibility of the OE lines to Pst strains cannot solely be attributed to the suppressed expression of R-genes but must also be attributed to the suppression of downstream signaling components, such as MOS2, EDS1 and EDS5. Before infection, the levels of salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) precursor OPDA were similar in the leaves of OE, pap2 and WT plants, whereas the levels of JA and its derivative JA-Ile were significantly lower in the leaves of OE lines and higher in the pap2 line. The expression of JA marker defense gene PDF1.2 was up-regulated in the OE lines compared to the WT prior to Pst DC3000 infection, but its expression was lower in the OE lines after infection. In summary, high fitness Arabidopsis thaliana exhibited altered JA metabolism and broad suppression of R-genes and downstream genes as well as a higher susceptibility to Pst infections."
https://openalex.org/W2584916524,"Mouse F9 cells differentiate to primitive endoderm (PrE) when treated with retinoic acid (RA). Differentiation is accompanied by increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and while treating F9 cells with antioxidants attenuates differentiation, H2O2 treatment alone is sufficient to induce PrE. We identified the NADPH oxidase (NOX) complexes as candidates for the source of this endogenous ROS, and within this gene family, and over the course of differentiation, Nox1 and Nox 4 show the greatest upregulation induced by RA. Gata6, encoding a master regulator of extraembryonic endoderm is also up-regulated by RA and we provide evidence that NOX1 and NOX4 protein levels increase in F9 cells overexpressing Gata6. Pan-NOX and NOX1-specific inhibitors significantly reduced the ability of RA to induce PrE, and this was recapitulated using a genetic approach to knockdown Nox1 and/or Nox4 transcripts. Interestingly, overexpressing either gene in untreated F9 cells did not induce differentiation, even though each elevated ROS levels. Thus, the data suggests that ROS produced during PrE differentiation is dependent in part on increased NOX1 and NOX4 levels, which is under the control of GATA6. Furthermore, these results suggest that the combined activity of multiple NOX proteins is necessary for the differentiation of F9 cells to primitive endoderm."
https://openalex.org/W2584017295,"This research study analysed the rheological properties of potato amylose and potato amylopectin in binary solutions of the following water and dimethyl sulfoxide concentrations: 90% DMSO (1), 80% DMSO (2) and 50% DMSO (3), with preparation methodology involving the dissolution at the temperature of 98°C. The studies of dynamic light scattering on the biopolymer coils and the determination of main relaxation times of the solutions were carried out. For the amylose solutions, the fast relaxation phenomena are predominant. The results of the quality tests of the hysteresis loop showed, that the amylose solutions in the solvents (1) and (2) are rheologically stable and shear-thickened. The amylose solutions in solvents (3) reveal oscillatory alterations of viscosity in the time. Amylopectin solutions are characterized by 80% share of slow relaxation phenomena, very low diffusion coefficients and hydrodynamic radii in the range of 2000 nm. The amylopectin solutions are rheologically unstable."
https://openalex.org/W2584167098,"Background Men who have sex with men (MSM) are permanently deferred from donating blood in Israel. Pressure to change this policy exists, despite data showing higher prevalence and incidence of HIV in MSM. A survey was conducted to evaluate current knowledge, attitudes, perceptions and compliance if deferral was changed. Study design and methods Anonymous survey was published in a gay-oriented website, collecting demographic information, history of blood donation, attitudes, knowledge and compliance with permanent versus temporary deferral. Responses were analyzed given 1 point for every ""yes"" response (0–7 points). Student’s t-test was applied to compare differences between continuous variables. Correlations were described with the Pearson correlation coefficient. Results Responses from 492 MSM were analyzed. Average age was 31±9 years. 76% donated blood at least once, mostly for social solidarity (score of 3.2 on 1–5 scale). Tests seeking or protest scores were 1.7 and 1.6, respectively. 66% were unaware of the higher risk of HIV transmission by MSM, or the potential to infect 3 recipients. Knowledge regarding HIV transmission by blood positively correlated with knowledge regarding other routes of HIV transmission (r = 0.11; p = 0.03), age (r = 0.10; p = 0.04), and higher rate of non-compliance with the current deferral policy (OR = 1.9; p = 0.02). Activism for LGBT rights was associated with lower risk for non-adherence (OR = 0.5; p = 0.03). If temporary deferral is introduced 66% will comply with the new policy, but 23% will continue to donate as long as MSM deferral policy is in place. Conclusion A high proportion of MSM do not comply with the current lifetime deferral. This may partially change if temporary deferral is introduced."
https://openalex.org/W2584385528,"Background Qigong is a mind-body intervention focusing on interoceptive awareness that appears to be a promising approach in anorexia nervosa (AN). In 2008, as part of our multidimensional treatment program for adolescent inpatients with AN, we began a weekly qigong workshop that turned out to be popular among our adolescent patients. Moreover psychiatrists perceived clinical benefits that deserved further exploration. Methods and findings A qualitative study therefore sought to obtain a deeper understanding of how young patients with severe AN experience qigong and to determine the incentives and barriers to adherence to qigong, to understanding its meaning, and to applying it in other contexts. Data were collected through 16 individual semi-structured face-to-face interviews and analyzed with the interpretative phenomenological analysis method. Eleven themes emerged from the analysis, categorized in 3 superordinate themes describing the incentives and barriers related to the patients themselves (individual dimension), to others (relational dimension), and to the setting (organizational dimension). Individual dimensions associated with AN (such as excessive exercise and mind-body cleavage) may curb adherence, whereas relational and organizational dimensions appear to provide incentives to join the activity in the first place but may also limit its post-discharge continuation. Once barriers are overcome, patients reported positive effects: satisfaction associated with relaxation and with the experience of mind-body integration. Conclusions Qigong appears to be an interesting therapeutic tool that may potentiate psychotherapy and contribute to the recovery process of patients with AN. Further analysis of the best time window for initiating qigong and of its place in overall management might help to overcome some of the barriers, limit the risks, and maximize its benefits."
https://openalex.org/W2584895120,"Recent studies indicate that glutamatergic signaling involves, and is regulated by, thiol modifying and redox-active compounds. In this study, we examined the role of a reactive cysteine residue, Cys-893, in the cytosolic C-terminal tail of GluA1 AMPA receptor as a potential regulatory target. Elimination of the thiol function by substitution of serine for Cys-893 led to increased steady-state expression level and strongly reduced interaction with SAP97, a major cytosolic interaction partner of GluA1 C-terminus. Moreover, we found that of the three cysteine residues in GluA1 C-terminal tail, Cys-893 is the predominant target for S-nitrosylation induced by exogenous nitric oxide donors in cultured cells and lysates. Co-precipitation experiments provided evidence for native association of SAP97 with neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and for the potential coupling of Ca2+-permeable GluA1 receptors with nNOS via SAP97. Our results show that Cys-893 can serve as a molecular target for regulatory thiol modifications of GluA1 receptors, including the effects of nitric oxide."
https://openalex.org/W2583390314,"Emerging evidence has indicated infants’ early sensitivity to acoustic cues in music. Do they interpret these cues in emotional terms to represent others’ affective states? The present study examined infants’ development of emotional understanding of music with a violation-of-expectation paradigm. Twelve- and 20-month-olds were presented with emotionally concordant and discordant music-face displays on alternate trials. The 20-month-olds, but not the 12-month-olds, were surprised by emotional incongruence between musical and facial expressions, suggesting their sensitivity to musical emotion. In a separate non-music task, only the 20-month-olds were able to use an actress’s affective facial displays to predict her subsequent action. Interestingly, for the 20-month-olds, such emotion-action understanding correlated with sensitivity to musical expressions measured in the first task. These two abilities however did not correlate with family income, parental estimation of language and communicative skills, and quality of parent-child interaction. The findings suggest that sensitivity to musical emotion and emotion-action understanding may be supported by a generalised common capacity to represent emotion from social cues, which lays a foundation for later social-communicative development."
https://openalex.org/W2585397334,"Two weeks into the presidency of Donald Trump, waves of angst are sweeping through the Mexican science community. The peso has plummeted against the dollar, affecting the value of grants: Mexican scientists purchase most of the research materials and equipment they use from the United States. Trump9s insistence on building a border wall and making Mexico pay for it has made scientists nervous about the fate of funding and support for cross-border collaborations. In response to increasingly chilly relations, Mexico9s National Council for Science and Technology said it will pursue collaborations beyond the United States, including with the European Union and China. Meanwhile, promising young Mexican scientists planning to go abroad are having second thoughts about studying in the United States, which no longer seems as welcoming as it once did."

https://openalex.org/W2585153258,"Last week, President Donald Trump issued an executive order barring the entry of any citizen from seven mostly Muslim nations for 90 days while procedures for more-rigorous vetting of visa applicants are put in place. The order sparked chaos at airports in the United States and abroad, as dozens of academics and others with valid U.S. entry documents were not allowed to board U.S.-bound flights or were turned back after arriving. It provoked angst in scientists and students from the target countries—Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Sudan, and Yemen—who had secured a visa to come to the United States, and in those already living there. And it raised broader questions about whether the country can continue to benefit from the flow of scientific and engineering talent from overseas."
https://openalex.org/W2583695722,"The U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) is aiming to merge some functions of its three largest optical observatories within a new body called the National Center for Optical and Infrared Astronomy. The new center would provide services to the Gemini Observatory (with twin 8.1-meter telescopes in Hawaii and Chile), the National Optical Astronomy Observatory with a handful of telescopes in Chile and the United States, and the still-rising Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, an 8.4-meter instrument in Chile. The fact that all three receive significant funding from NSF but each is governed by an entirely separate organization is emblematic of the fractured nature of U.S. astronomy. By pooling many functions, NSF hopes to make better use of available expertise and achieve economies of scale while preserving independent scientific operations."
