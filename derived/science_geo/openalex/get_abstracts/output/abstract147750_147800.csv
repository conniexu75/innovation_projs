We found that 2-arachidonoylglycerol induces a rapid transient increase in intracellular free Ca2+concentrations in HL-60 cells. The response was affected by neither cyclooxygenase inhibitors nor lipoxygenase inhibitors, suggesting that arachidonic acid metabolites are not involved. Consistent with this notion, free arachidonic acid was devoid of any agonistic activity. Importantly, the Ca2+ transient induced by 2-arachidonoylglycerol was blocked by pretreatment of the cells with SR144528, a CB2 receptor-specific antagonist, but not with SR141716A, a CB1 receptor-specific antagonist, indicating the involvement of the CB2 receptor but not the CB1 receptor in this cellular response. Gi or Go is also assumed to be involved, because pertussis toxin treatment of the cells abolished the response. We further examined the structure-activity relationship. We found that 2-arachidonoylglycerol is the most potent compound among a number of naturally occurring cannabimimetic molecules. Interestingly, anandamide and N-palmitoylethanolamine, other putative endogenous ligands, were found to be a weak partial agonist and an inactive ligand, respectively. These results strongly suggest that the CB2 receptor is originally a 2-arachidonoylglycerol receptor, and 2-arachidonoylglycerol is the intrinsic natural ligand for the CB2 receptor that is abundant in the immune system.

Δ9- tetrahydrocannabinol 2-arachidonoylglycerol intracellular free Ca2+ concentrations Δ9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC),1 a major psychoactive constituent of marijuana, is known to exert a variety of pharmacological effects on laboratory animals and humans. When administered orally or intravenously, Δ9-THC induces reduced spontaneous motor activity, analgesia, heightened sensory awareness, euphoria, and impairment of short-term memory (1Dewey W.L. Pharmacol. Rev. 1986; 38: 151-178PubMed Google Scholar). Δ9-THC is also known to exert profound effects on several biological systems other than the central nervous system; for example, Δ9-THC exhibits potent immunosuppressive activities (2Hollister L.E.

Pharmacol. 1997; 330: 231-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The mechanism underlying such diverse actions of Δ9-THC remained obscure until the late 1980s. In 1988, Devane et al. (13Devane W.A. Dysarz III, F.A. Johnson M.R. Melvin L.S. Howlett A.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1988; 34: 605-613PubMed Google Scholar) provided clear evidence that rat brain synaptosomes contain a specific binding site for cannabinoids using a radiolabeled synthetic cannabinoid [3H]CP55940. Their finding strongly suggested that various cannabimimetic molecules including Δ9-THC itself bind to a specific receptor site(s) thereby eliciting a variety of responses. To date, two types of cannabinoid receptors have been identified as follows: the CB1 receptor expressed primarily in the nervous system (14Matsuda L.A. Lolait S.J. Brownstein M.J. Young A.C. Bonner T.I. Nature. 1990; 346: 561-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (4176) Google Scholar), and the CB2 receptor expressed mainly in the immune system (15Munro S. Thomas K.L. Abu-Shaar M. Nature. 1993; 365: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (4097) Google Scholar). Both are seven transmembrane, G protein-coupled receptors, and they share 44% overall identity (68% identity for transmembrane domains) (15Munro S. Thomas K.L. Abu-Shaar M. Nature. 1993; 365: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (4097) Google Scholar). The discovery of specific receptors for cannabinoids prompted the search for endogenous ligands. To date, two types of arachidonic acid-containing molecules, anandamide (16Devane W.A. Hanus L. Breuer A. Pertwee R.G. Stevenson L.A. Griffin G. Gibson D. Mandelbaum A. Etinger A. Mechoulam R. Science. 1992; 258: 1946-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (4637) Google Scholar) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) (17Sugiura T. Kondo S. Sukagawa A. Nakane S. Shinoda A. Itoh K. Yamashita A. Waku K.

Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (2330) Google Scholar), have been reported as putative endogenous cannabinoid receptor ligands. Anandamide was isolated from porcine brain (16Devane W.A. Hanus L. Breuer A. Pertwee R.G. Stevenson L.A. Griffin G. Gibson D. Mandelbaum A. Etinger A. Mechoulam R. Science. 1992; 258: 1946-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (4637) Google Scholar), and 2-AG was isolated from rat brain (17Sugiura T. Kondo S. Sukagawa A. Nakane S. Shinoda A. Itoh K. Yamashita A. Waku K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1806) Google Scholar) and canine gut (18Mechoulam R. Ben-Shabat S. Hanus L. Ligumsky M. Kaminski N.E. Schatz A.R. Gopher A.

So far, a number of studies have been directed toward anandamide (19Mechoulam R. Fride E. Pertwee R.G. Cannabinoid Receptors. Academic Press, London1995: 233-258Google Scholar, 20Di Marzo V. Melck D. Bisogno T. De Petrocellis L. Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 521-528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar); yet, apparently, little attention has been paid to 2-AG. Previously, we investigated the level and the biosynthetic pathways for anandamide in the brain (21Sugiura T. Kondo S. Sukagawa A. Tonegawa T. Nakane S. Yamashita A. Ishima Y. Waku K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). We found that the level of anandamide in the fresh brain is very low. Similar results were obtained by several other investigators (22Schmid P.C. Krebsbach R.J. Perry S.R. Dettmer T.M. Maasson J.L. Schmid H.H.O.

Ishima Y. Waku K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) and other investigators (25Di Marzo V. Fontana A. Cadas H. Schinelli S. Cimino G. Schwartz J.-C. Piomelli D. Nature. 1994; 372: 686-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (1340) Google Scholar, 26Cadas H. di Tomaso E. Piomelli D. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1226-1242Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) also provided evidence that anandamide is synthesized through the hydrolysis of N-arachidonoylphosphatidylethanolamine which was formed from phosphatidylethanolamine and arachidonic acid esterified at the 1-position but not at the 2-position of phospholipids through the action of a transacylase, although selective or preferential synthesis of anandamide compared with other molecular species ofN-acylethanolamines has not yet been observed. This observation together with a previous finding of a low level of anandamide in the brain raised the question of whether anandamide is actually of physiological importance, because usually only trace amounts of arachidonic acid are esterified at the 1-position of glycerophospholipids. Recently, we investigated in detail the potencies of various cannabimimetic molecules to induce a Ca2+ transient in neuroblastoma × glioma hybrid NG108–15 cells that are known to express the CB1 receptor (27Sugiura T.

We found that low nanomolar concentrations of 2-AG elicit Ca2+ transients through a CB1 receptor-dependent mechanism, the activity of 2-AG being more potent than those of other structurally related compounds. In contrast to 2-AG, anandamide was found to act as a weak partial agonist at least in this assay system (27Sugiura T. Kodaka T. Kondo S. Tonegawa T. Nakane S. Kishimoto S. Yamashita A. Waku K.

Based on these observations, we proposed that the cannabinoid CB1 receptor is originally a 2-AG receptor (28Sugiura T. Kodaka T. Kondo S. Nakane S. Kondo H. Waku K. Ishima Y. Watanabe K. Yamamoto I.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 152-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) of 2-AG in the brain, neither of which is observed with anandamide, also support this hypothesis. Despite recent rapid progress in cannabinoid receptor research, however, a number of important issues still remain unelucidated. One important question to be answered concerns the endogenous physiological ligand for the CB2 receptor. Previously, Facci et al. (33Facci L. Dal Toso R. Romanello S. Buriani A. Skaper S.D. Leon A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3376-3380Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar) proposed that N-palmitoylethanolamine is an endogenous ligand for the CB2 receptor, yet conflicting experimental results have been reported by other investigators (34Showalter V.M. Compton D.R. Martin B.R. Abood M.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 278: 989-999PubMed Google Scholar). Anandamide and 2-AG are also candidates for the endogenous ligand for the CB2 receptor, yet little information is available concerning the relative physiological importance of these molecules includingN-palmitoylethanolamine as the CB2 receptor agonist. Because the CB2 receptor is assumed essential in the modulation of several immune cell functions (15Munro S. Thomas K.L. Abu-Shaar M.

Here, we investigated the structure-activity relationship of various cannabimimetic molecules by comparing their potencies to induce Ca2+ transients using a promyelocytic leukemia cell line, HL-60, from which the CB2 receptor gene was cloned (15Munro S. Thomas K.L. Abu-Shaar M. Nature. 1993; 365: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (4097) Google Scholar). Arachidonic acid, palmitic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid, γ-linolenic acid, eicosatrienoic acid (n − 3 and n − 6), eicosapentaenoic acid (n − 3), docosatetraenoic acid (n− 6), docosahexaenoic acid (n − 3), and essentially fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (BSA) were purchased from Sigma. Fura-2/AM was obtained from Wako Pure Chemicals (Osaka, Japan). Eicosatrienoic acid (n − 9) and eicosatetraynoic acid were purchased from Cayman Chemical Co. (Ann Arbor, MI). SR141716A, U73122, and U73343 were acquired from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). CP55940 and HU-210 were purchased from Tocris (Bristol, UK). (S)-(+)-2-Amino-1-propanol, (S)-(+)-2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxolane-4-methanol (1,2-O-isopropylidene-sn-glycerol), and (R)-(−)-2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxolane-4-methanol (2,3-O-isopropylidene-sn-glycerol) were obtained from Tokyo Kasei Kogyo (Tokyo, Japan). WIN55212-2 and WIN55212-3 were from Research Biochemicals (Natick, MA). Pertussis toxin was obtained from List Biological Laboratories (Campbell, CA). SR144528 was a generous gift from Sanofi (Montpellier, France). Δ9-THC was provided by Dr. Ikuo Yamamoto (Hokuriku University, Kanazawa, Japan). 1,3-Benzylidene-sn-glycerol was prepared from glycerol and benzaldehyde using sulfosalicylic acid as a catalyst. Various types of fatty acid anhydrides were prepared from respective fatty acids by treatment with dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. 2-Acyl-1,3-benzylideneglycerol was synthesized from 1,3-benzylideneglycerol and fatty acid anhydrides using dimethylaminopyridine as a catalyst. It was then purified by TLC using petroleum ether:diethyl ether:acetic acid (80:20:1, v/v) as the solvent system (R f, 0.22). Purified 2-acyl-1,3-benzylideneglycerols were then treated with boric acid and boric acid trimethyl ester, at 85 °C under vacuum for 3 min, to yield 2-monoacylglycerols as described previously (29Sugiura T. Kodaka T. Nakane S. Miyashita T. Kondo S. Suhara Y. Takayama H. Waku K. Seki C. Baba N. Ishima Y. J. Biol.

To obtain 1-AG and 3-AG, 2,3-O-isopropylidene-sn-glycerol and 1,2-O-isopropylidene-sn-glycerol, respectively, were employed instead of 1,3-benzylidene-sn-glycerol. Anandamide and N-arachidonoylserinol were synthesized by treating arachidonic anhydride with excess amounts of ethanolamine and serinol, respectively, and purified by TLC as described elsewhere (27Sugiura T.

HL-60 cells were grown at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. Poly(A)+ RNAs (5 μg) from HL-60 cells and human brain and spleen were electrophoresed in a 0.7% agarose-formaldehyde gel and transferred onto a Hybond-N+ Nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). CB1 probe (human CB1 receptor cDNA PstI digest, 699 base pairs), CB2 probe (human CB2 receptor cDNA SphI/SfiI digest, 524 base pairs), and β-actin probe (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan) were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (NEN Life Science Products) using Megaprime DNA labeling system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Hybridization was performed at 65 °C for 2 h in QuikHyb solution (Stratagene, Cambridge, UK). The filter was washed in 0.2× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 msodium citrate) containing 0.1% SDS at 65 °C and subjected to autoradiography. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed according to the method employed for the analysis of the platelet-activating factor receptor gene and the β-actin gene (44Kishimoto S. Shimadzu W. Izumi T. Shimizu T. Fukuda T. Makino S. Sugiura T. Waku K. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4126-4132PubMed Google Scholar) with a slight modification in which the CB1 receptor gene or the CB2 receptor gene and β-actin gene were amplified separately. Briefly, cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of poly(A)+RNA using Superscript II reverse-transcriptase and oligo(dT)18 as a primer. One-tenth of the reaction mixture was used for PCR. The primers used to amplify the CB1 receptor mRNA sequence were CB1-2 (sense, 5′-CGCAAAGATAGCCGCAACGTGT-3′) and CB1-5 (antisense, 5′-CAGATTGCAGTTTCTCGCAGTT-3′). The primers for the CB2 receptor mRNA sequence were CB2-5 (sense, 5′-TGGCAGCGTGACTATGACCTT-3′) and CB2-6 (antisense, 5′-ACCTCACATCCAGCCTCATTC-3′). The primers for the β-actin mRNA sequence were ACT1 (sense, 5′-CAGAGCAAGAGAGGCATCCT-3′) and ACT2 (antisense, 5′-AGGATCTTCATGAGGTAGTC-3′). PCR was carried out using 2 units of Taq polymerase in 100 μl of a reaction mixture containing [α-32P]dCTP (111 TBq/mmol, 370 Bq in a reaction) under the following conditions: for the human CB1 receptor gene, denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 58 °C for 1 min, and elongation at 72 °C for 1 min; for the human CB2 receptor gene, denaturation at 95 °C for 1 min, annealing at 60 °C for 1 min, and elongation at 75 °C for 1 min; for the β-actin gene, denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 55 °C for 1 min, and elongation at 72 °C for 1 min. A 10-μl aliquot of the reaction mixture was sampled every cycle during the 24–33 cycles for amplification of either the CB1 receptor gene or the cB2 receptor gene or 16–23 cycles for the β-actin gene. The samples were further incubated at 72 °C for 9 min and then electrophoresed on a 6% polyacrylamide gel. The relative radioactivity (photostimulated luminescence value) of the band corresponding to each PCR product was determined in a bioimaging analyzer BAS-1500 (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). The results were plotted on a semilogarithmic scale versusthe cycle number to obtain amplification curves, and the cycle difference between the logarithmic phase of the amplification curve for the CB1 receptor gene or the CB2 receptor gene and that for the β-actin gene. The ratio of CB1 receptor mRNA or CB2 receptor mRNA to β-actin mRNA was calculated using the following formula: ratio of CB1 receptor mRNA or CB2 receptor mRNA to β-actin mRNA = 2(-Δcycle). Subconfluent cells were further incubated in fresh medium without fetal bovine serum for 24 h. The cells were next suspended by gentle pipetting in 25 mm Hepes-buffered Tyrode's solution (−Ca2+) (pH 7.4) containing 3 μm Fura-2/AM and further incubated at 37 °C for 45 min. The cells were then centrifuged (180 ×g for 5 min), washed twice with Hepes-Tyrode's solution (−Ca2+), and resuspended in Hepes-Tyrode's solution (−Ca2+) containing 0.1% BSA. [Ca2+] i was estimated using a CAF-100 Ca2+ analyzer (JASCO, Tokyo, Japan) as described previously (27Sugiura T. Kodaka T. Kondo S. Tonegawa T. Nakane S. Kishimoto S. Yamashita A. Waku K. Biochem.

CaCl2 was added 4–5 min before the measurement (final Ca2+ concentration in the cuvette, 1 mm). 2-AG and other related compounds were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO), and aliquots (1 μl each) were added to the cuvette (final Me2SO concentration, 0.2%). Me2SO (final concentration, 0.4%) per se did not markedly affect the [Ca2+] i . In some experiments, cells suspended in 500 μl of Hepes-Tyrode's solution (−Ca2+) containing 0.1% BSA were pretreated with CP55940 (final concentration, 10 μm) or 2-arachidonoylglycerol (final concentration, 10 μm) or the vehicle alone (1 μl of Me2SO) at 37 °C for 1 min. Cells were then sedimented by centrifugation and resuspended in Hepes-Tyrode's solution (−Ca2+) containing 0.1% BSA. After the addition of CaCl2 (final concentration, 1 mm), 2-AG (final concentration, 1 μm) was added to the cuvette, and the changes in [Ca2+] i were analyzed. To examine the effect of the removal of extracellular free Ca2+, cells were incubated in Hepes-Tyrode's solution containing 1 mmCaCl2 at 37 °C for 3 min. The cell suspension was then centrifuged, and the supernatant was removed. The sedimented cells were resuspended in Hepes-Tyrode's solution containing 0.1 mmEGTA. The effect of 2-AG (final concentration, 1 μm) on [Ca2+] i was analyzed as described above. First, we examined the subtype of cannabinoid receptor mRNA present in HL-60 cells by Northern blot analysis and by quantitative RT-PCR analysis. Fig. 1 shows the result of Northern blot analysis. HL-60 cells were found to possess the CB2 receptor mRNA but not the CB1 receptor mRNA. This is in contrast to the case in the brain where the CB1 receptor mRNA is predominant. We detected two major transcripts (4.4 and 2.5 kb) for CB2 receptor mRNA in either HL-60 cells or the spleen, the result being consistent with previous reports (15Munro S. Thomas K.L. Abu-Shaar M.

The abundance of the CB2 receptor mRNA compared with the CB1 receptor mRNA in HL-60 cells was further confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 2).FIG. 2Analysis of CB1 receptor mRNA and CB2 receptor mRNA in the human brain and HL-60 cells by quantitative RT-PCR.

Previously, we have found that 2-AG induces a rapid, transient increase in [Ca2+] i in NG108–15 cells through a cannabinoid CB1 receptor-dependent mechanism (27Sugiura T. Kodaka T. Kondo S.

In the present study, we first examined whether or not 2-AG induces a Ca2+transient in HL-60 cells which express the CB2 receptor. We found that 1 μm 2-AG induces a rapid transient increase in [Ca2+] i (Fig. 3). The response was not affected by pretreatment of the cells with either 10 μm indomethacin (a cyclooxygenase inhibitor) or 10 μm nordihydroguaiaretic acid (a lipoxygenase inhibitor) (Fig. 3). We further confirmed that the response was not influenced by pretreatment of the cells with 10 μmeicosatetraynoic acid which blocks both cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase (data not shown). These results clearly indicate that the response induced by 2-AG is not due to arachidonic acid metabolites that may be produced during the incubation of the cells with 2-AG. Next, we examined the effects of pretreatment with cannabinoid receptor antagonists on the response induced by 2-AG. As shown in Fig. 4, pretreatment of the cells with SR141716A, a CB1 receptor-specific antagonist (or inverse agonist), did not affect the response induced by 2-AG, whereas pretreatment of the cells with SR144528, a CB2 receptor-specific antagonist (or inverse agonist), reduced the response markedly. It is evident from these results that the response induced by 2-AG is mediated"
https://openalex.org/W1974747471,"Cholesterol homeostasis in animal cells is achieved by regulated cleavage of membrane-bound transcription factors, designated SREBPs. Proteolytic release of the active domains of SREBPs from membranes requires a sterol-sensing protein, SCAP, which forms a complex with SREBPs. In sterol-depleted cells, SCAP escorts SREBPs from ER to Golgi, where SREBPs are cleaved by Site-1 protease (S1P). Sterols block this transport and abolish cleavage. Relocating active S1P from Golgi to ER by treating cells with brefeldin A or by fusing the ER retention signal KDEL to S1P obviates the SCAP requirement and renders cleavage insensitive to sterols. Transport-dependent proteolysis may be a common mechanism to regulate the processing of membrane proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1996598000,"In chromaffin cells, an increase in intracellular Ca2+ leads to an exocytotic burst followed by sustained secretion. The burst can be further resolved into two kinetically distinct components, which suggests the presence of two separate pools of vesicles. To investigate how these components relate to SNARE complex formation, we introduced an antibody that blocks SNARE assembly but not disassembly. In the presence of the antibody, the sustained component was largely blocked, the burst was slightly reduced, and one of its kinetic components was eliminated. We conclude that SNARE complexes form before Ca2+-triggered membrane fusion and exist in a dynamic equilibrium between a loose and a tight state, both of which support exocytosis. Interaction of the antibody with preformed SNARE complexes favors the loose state."
https://openalex.org/W2050030183,"The unfolded protein response (UPR) mediates signaling from the endoplasmic reticulum to the nucleus. In yeast, a key regulatory step in the UPR is the spliceosome-independent splicing of HAC1 mRNA encoding a UPR-specific transcription factor, which is initiated by the transmembrane kinase/endoribonuclease Ire1. We show that yeast HAC1 mRNA is correctly spliced in mammalian cells upon UPR induction and that mammalian Ire1 can precisely cleave both splice junctions. Surprisingly, UPR induction leads to proteolytic cleavage of Ire1, releasing fragments containing the kinase and nuclease domains that accumulate in the nucleus. Nuclear localization and UPR induction are reduced in presenilin-1 knockout cells. These results suggest that the salient features of the UPR are conserved among eukaryotic cells and that presenilin-1 controls Ire1 proteolysis in mammalian cells."

The highly conserved Runt domain is the DNA binding motif in this family of proteins. AML-1 appears to act as an “organizing” factor for many promoters and enhancers by interacting with co-activators and other DNA binding transcription factors (18Wotton D. Ghysdael J. Wang S.

Biol. 1997; 17: 5581-5587Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). In addition, when fused to the DNA binding domain of GAL-4, Runx family proteins repressed transcription through GAL4 DNA-binding sites (28Aronson B.D. Fisher A.L. Blechman K. Caudy M. Gergen J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5581-5587Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). AML-1 interacted with the Groucho co-repressor in yeast two-hybrid assays, and the Groucho binding domain contributed to repression, but it was not sufficient for full activity (28Aronson B.D. Fisher A.L. Blechman K. Caudy M. Gergen J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5581-5587Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). As well, AML-1 cooperated with LEF-1 to repress transcription of the T-cell receptor α enhancer, and this repression was partially dependent on the Groucho binding domain (29Levanon D. Goldstein R.E. Bernstein Y. Tang H. Goldenberg D. Stifani S. Paroush Z. Groner Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11590-11595Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Thus, AML-1 may act as a master regulator that facilitates the assembly of protein complexes for transcriptional activation or transcriptional repression in a cell type-specific manner.We have established an assay for AML-1β-dependent repression using the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 Waf1/Cip1 promoter (AML-1B is the largest isoform of AML-1(9)). Repression was not mediated by the Groucho binding motif. This led us to identify an association between AML-1B and the mSin3 co-repressors. An AML-1B protein containing a deletion of the mSin3A binding domain lacked the ability to repress transcription. These results define a mechanism for AML-1-dependent repression.DISCUSSIONAML-1B is a transcriptional activator of numerous tissue-specific promoters and enhancers. In this report, we show that AML-1B also acts as a transcriptional repressor of the p21 Waf1/Cip1 promoter. AML-1B and mSin3A interacted in yeast two-hybrid assays and by co-immunoprecipitation from mammalian cells. Although this association is observed in multiple assays, and it is maintained in the presence of ionic detergents, it is possible that this interaction is not direct but that it is mediated by an as yet unidentified protein. As well as the AML-1B SID, a second C-terminal region of AML-1B is required for repression (residues 290–387). This region contains putative protein interaction sites and a nuclear matrix targeting signal (41Zeng C. van Wijnen A.J. Stein J.L. Meyers S. Sun W. Shopland L. Lawrence J.B. Penman S. Lian J.B. Stein G.S. Hiebert S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6746-6751Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that other co-repressors contribute to AML-1-mediated repression or that correct subnuclear localization is required.The mSin3 co-repressors often act in cooperation with accessory proteins such as the nuclear hormone co-repressors N-CoR and SMRT and histone deacetylases (40Torchia J. Glass C. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 373-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). We determined that AML-1B (residues 1–237) and N-CoR (residues 1019–2061) interact in the yeast two-hybrid system, but we have not been able to consistently co-immunoprecipitate AML-1B and N-CoR from mammalian cells.2 Because residues 1–237 of AML-1B also interact with mSin3 proteins, this association between AML-1 and N-CoR may be indirect. Similarly, we have not been able to co-immunoprecipitate consistently histone deacetylase-1 or -2 with AML-1B.2 Again, these associations may be indirect. It is also possible that the conditions required to solubilize AML-1B (AML-1B is a component of the nuclear matrix (41Zeng C. van Wijnen A.J. Stein J.L. Meyers S. Sun W. Shopland L. Lawrence J.B. Penman S. Lian J.B. Stein G.S. Hiebert S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6746-6751Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar)) make it difficult to preserve these weak protein interactions. Although mSin3A can also repress transcription by interacting with TFIIB (38Muscat G.E. Burke L.J. Downes M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2899-2907Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 39Wong C.W. Privalsky M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5500-5510Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), our results with trichostatin A indicate that histone deacetylases contribute to AML-1B-mediated repression.AML-1B can function as both a repressor and an activator of transcription. AML-1B is a weak transactivator in C33A, CV-1, and Jurkat cells but cooperates with transcription factors such as C/EBPα or Ets-1 to more strongly activate transcription (25Westendorf J.J. Yamamoto C.M. Lenny N. Downing J.R. Selsted M.E. Hiebert S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 322-333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Petrovick M.S. Hiebert S.W. Friedman A.D. Hetherington C.J.

AML-1-dependent repression is cell type-specific as it represses p21 Waf1/Cip1 in NIH 3T3 cells (Figs. 1 and 5). We have also observed AML-1-dependent repression of theMultidrug Resistance-1 and Rous sarcoma virus promoters in NIH 3T3 cells. 3S. W. Hiebert, unpublished observations. Because mSin3 levels are similar between these cell lines,2 other factors must influence AML-1 transcriptional activity.Whereas AML-1 can both activate and repress transcription in a cell type-specific manner, the AML-1 fusion proteins found in acute leukemia are constitutive repressors (44Fenrick R. Hiebert S.W. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 31 (suppl.): 194-202Crossref Google Scholar). The work presented here has implications for the mechanism of action of these chromosomal translocation fusion proteins. The entire SID is retained in the t(12;21), which retains nearly all of AML-1 (6Romana S.P. Mauchauffe M. Le Coniat M. Chumakov I. Le Paslier D. Berger R. Bernard O.A.

We have shown that the t(12;21) can bind to mSin3 proteins, and this interaction is mediated by the AML-1 SID as well as by the pointed domain in TEL (46Fenrick R. Amann J. Lutterbach B. Wang L. Westendorf J. Downing J.R. Hiebert S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6566-6574Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Interestingly, transcriptional repression by TEL/AML-1 was abrogated by deletion of the AML-1 SID and the TEL pointed domain (8Hiebert S.W. Sun W. Davis J.N. Golub T. Shurtleff S. Buijs A.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1015-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Although the t(3;21) deletes most of the C terminus of AML-1 in much the same manner as the t(8;21), the t(3;21) breakpoint can retain the entire AML-1 SID (5Nucifora G. Rowley J.D. Blood. 1995; 86: 1-14Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We are currently investigating a role for mSin3 in AML/EVI1 transcriptional repression. Coupled with the utilization of the mSin3 co-repressors by the t(8;21), the t(15;17), and t(11;17) in acute promyelocytic leukemia (44Fenrick R. Hiebert S.W. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 31 (suppl.): 194-202Crossref Google Scholar), our work suggests that this co-repressor may be used by a significant proportion of chromosomal translocation fusion proteins. If so, mSin3A, mSin3B, and their downstream effectors (e.g. histone deacetylases) are potential therapeutic targets in a large proportion of acute leukemias. Translocations that disrupt the AML1 gene are among the most common aberrations found in human leukemia. The t(8;21) is found in 10–15% of myeloid leukemias and gives rise to the AML-11/ETO transcriptional repressor (1Miyoshi H. Shimizu K. Kozu T. Maseki N. Kaneko Y. Ohki M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

AML-1 is a member of the Runt-like transcription factors (Runx-1, -2, and -3), named after the Runt protein that controls segmentation in theDrosophila embryo (11Kania M.A. Bonner A.S. Duffy J.B. Gergen J.P. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1701-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 12Gergen J.P. Butler B.A. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1179-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The highly conserved Runt domain is the DNA binding motif in this family of proteins. AML-1 appears to act as an “organizing” factor for many promoters and enhancers by interacting with co-activators and other DNA binding transcription factors (18Wotton D. Ghysdael J. Wang S.

Both Runt and a second Drosophila runt-like protein Lozenge can repress as well as activate transcription (17Daga A. Karlovich C.A. Dumstrei K. Banerjee U. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1194-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 28Aronson B.D. Fisher A.L. Blechman K. Caudy M. Gergen J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5581-5587Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). In addition, when fused to the DNA binding domain of GAL-4, Runx family proteins repressed transcription through GAL4 DNA-binding sites (28Aronson B.D. Fisher A.L. Blechman K. Caudy M. Gergen J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5581-5587Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). AML-1 interacted with the Groucho co-repressor in yeast two-hybrid assays, and the Groucho binding domain contributed to repression, but it was not sufficient for full activity (28Aronson B.D. Fisher A.L. Blechman K. Caudy M. Gergen J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5581-5587Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). As well, AML-1 cooperated with LEF-1 to repress transcription of the T-cell receptor α enhancer, and this repression was partially dependent on the Groucho binding domain (29Levanon D. Goldstein R.E. Bernstein Y. Tang H. Goldenberg D. Stifani S. Paroush Z. Groner Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11590-11595Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Thus, AML-1 may act as a master regulator that facilitates the assembly of protein complexes for transcriptional activation or transcriptional repression in a cell type-specific manner. We have established an assay for AML-1β-dependent repression using the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 Waf1/Cip1 promoter (AML-1B is the largest isoform of AML-1(9)). Repression was not mediated by the Groucho binding motif. This led us to identify an association between AML-1B and the mSin3 co-repressors. An AML-1B protein containing a deletion of the mSin3A binding domain lacked the ability to repress transcription. These results define a mechanism for AML-1-dependent repression. DISCUSSIONAML-1B is a transcriptional activator of numerous tissue-specific promoters and enhancers. In this report, we show that AML-1B also acts as a transcriptional repressor of the p21 Waf1/Cip1 promoter. AML-1B and mSin3A interacted in yeast two-hybrid assays and by co-immunoprecipitation from mammalian cells. Although this association is observed in multiple assays, and it is maintained in the presence of ionic detergents, it is possible that this interaction is not direct but that it is mediated by an as yet unidentified protein. As well as the AML-1B SID, a second C-terminal region of AML-1B is required for repression (residues 290–387). This region contains putative protein interaction sites and a nuclear matrix targeting signal (41Zeng C. van Wijnen A.J. Stein J.L. Meyers S. Sun W. Shopland L. Lawrence J.B. Penman S. Lian J.B. Stein G.S. Hiebert S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6746-6751Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that other co-repressors contribute to AML-1-mediated repression or that correct subnuclear localization is required.The mSin3 co-repressors often act in cooperation with accessory proteins such as the nuclear hormone co-repressors N-CoR and SMRT and histone deacetylases (40Torchia J. Glass C. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 373-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). We determined that AML-1B (residues 1–237) and N-CoR (residues 1019–2061) interact in the yeast two-hybrid system, but we have not been able to consistently co-immunoprecipitate AML-1B and N-CoR from mammalian cells.2 Because residues 1–237 of AML-1B also interact with mSin3 proteins, this association between AML-1 and N-CoR may be indirect. Similarly, we have not been able to co-immunoprecipitate consistently histone deacetylase-1 or -2 with AML-1B.2 Again, these associations may be indirect. It is also possible that the conditions required to solubilize AML-1B (AML-1B is a component of the nuclear matrix (41Zeng C. van Wijnen A.J. Stein J.L. Meyers S. Sun W. Shopland L. Lawrence J.B. Penman S. Lian J.B. Stein G.S. Hiebert S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6746-6751Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar)) make it difficult to preserve these weak protein interactions. Although mSin3A can also repress transcription by interacting with TFIIB (38Muscat G.E. Burke L.J. Downes M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2899-2907Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 39Wong C.W. Privalsky M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5500-5510Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), our results with trichostatin A indicate that histone deacetylases contribute to AML-1B-mediated repression.AML-1B can function as both a repressor and an activator of transcription. AML-1B is a weak transactivator in C33A, CV-1, and Jurkat cells but cooperates with transcription factors such as C/EBPα or Ets-1 to more strongly activate transcription (25Westendorf J.J. Yamamoto C.M. Lenny N. Downing J.R. Selsted M.E. Hiebert S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 322-333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Petrovick M.S. Hiebert S.W. Friedman A.D. Hetherington C.J.

Biol. 1998; 18: 2444-2454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the p21 Waf1/Cip1 promoter, we observed a modest transactivation by AML-1B in the K562 myeloid cell line (approximately 7-fold). AML-1-dependent repression is cell type-specific as it represses p21 Waf1/Cip1 in NIH 3T3 cells (Figs. 1 and 5). We have also observed AML-1-dependent repression of theMultidrug Resistance-1 and Rous sarcoma virus promoters in NIH 3T3 cells. 3S. W. Hiebert, unpublished observations. Because mSin3 levels are similar between these cell lines,2 other factors must influence AML-1 transcriptional activity.Whereas AML-1 can both activate and repress transcription in a cell type-specific manner, the AML-1 fusion proteins found in acute leukemia are constitutive repressors (44Fenrick R. Hiebert S.W. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 31 (suppl.): 194-202Crossref Google Scholar). The work presented here has implications for the mechanism of action of these chromosomal translocation fusion proteins. The entire SID is retained in the t(12;21), which retains nearly all of AML-1 (6Romana S.P. Mauchauffe M. Le Coniat M. Chumakov I. Le Paslier D. Berger R. Bernard O.A.

We have shown that the t(12;21) can bind to mSin3 proteins, and this interaction is mediated by the AML-1 SID as well as by the pointed domain in TEL (46Fenrick R. Amann J. Lutterbach B. Wang L. Westendorf J. Downing J.R. Hiebert S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6566-6574Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Interestingly, transcriptional repression by TEL/AML-1 was abrogated by deletion of the AML-1 SID and the TEL pointed domain (8Hiebert S.W. Sun W. Davis J.N. Golub T. Shurtleff S. Buijs A.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1015-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Although the t(3;21) deletes most of the C terminus of AML-1 in much the same manner as the t(8;21), the t(3;21) breakpoint can retain the entire AML-1 SID (5Nucifora G. Rowley J.D. Blood. 1995; 86: 1-14Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We are currently investigating a role for mSin3 in AML/EVI1 transcriptional repression. Coupled with the utilization of the mSin3 co-repressors by the t(8;21), the t(15;17), and t(11;17) in acute promyelocytic leukemia (44Fenrick R. Hiebert S.W. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 31 (suppl.): 194-202Crossref Google Scholar), our work suggests that this co-repressor may be used by a significant proportion of chromosomal translocation fusion proteins. If so, mSin3A, mSin3B, and their downstream effectors (e.g. histone deacetylases) are potential therapeutic targets in a large proportion of acute leukemias. AML-1B is a transcriptional activator of numerous tissue-specific promoters and enhancers. In this report, we show that AML-1B also acts as a transcriptional repressor of the p21 Waf1/Cip1 promoter.

Several assembly proteins are required for the late stages of oxidase assembly in eukaryotes; some of these are also present in Rb. sphaeroides. To investigate the role of one of these proteins, Cox11p, the mitochondrial-like oxidase of Rb. sphaeroides was overexpressed and purified from cells that lacked cox11, the gene for Cox11p. The oxidase that assembled in the absence of Cox11p lacked CuBat the active site and contained greatly reduced amounts of metal at the magnesium/manganese-binding site between subunits I and II. This inactive oxidase, however, did contain hemes a anda 3, CuA, and all three subunits. These results indicate that Cox11p is required at a late, perhaps final, step in the assembly of cytochrome oxidase, most likely the insertion of CuB. Oxidase which assembled in a strain with a low copy number of cox11 appeared nearly wild type, suggesting that Cox11p is required in substoichiometric amounts for its role in oxidase assembly.

Heme a has two histidine ligands, whereas hemea 3 is bound by a single histidine residue, leaving the sixth coordination position available for binding O2. CuB is ligated by three histidines and is located 4.5–5.2 Å from the iron of heme a 3 (3Iwata S. Ostermeier C. Ludwig B. Michel H.

Espe M.P. Zhen Y. Babcock G.T. Ferguson-Miller S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7586-7592Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The assembly of the multisubunit oxidase with its metal centers apparently occurs in an ordered sequence; most of the details, however, remain unresolved (15Hundt E. Trapp M. Kadenbach B. FEBS Lett. 1980; 115: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 16Wielburski A. Nelson B.D. Biochem. J. 1983; 212: 829-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 17Nijtmans L.G.J. Taanman J.-W. Muijsers A.O. Speijer D. Van Den Bogert C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, genetic analysis indicates that more than a dozen genes are involved in holoenzyme assembly (18McEwen J.E. Ko C. Kloeckner-Gruissem B. Poyton R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11872-11879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Tzagoloff A. Dieckmann C.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 211-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Orthologs of some of these genes are found in bacteria, suggesting that they are required for assembly of the core subunits and the metal centers (20Saraste M. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1990; 23: 331-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 21Mogi T. Saiki K. Anraku Y. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Two such genes,cox10 and cox11, are present in the Rb. sphaeroides operon that encodes subunits II and III of the oxidase (22Cao J. Hosler J. Shapleigh J. Revzin A. Ferguson-Miller S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24273-24278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The importance of cox10 and cox11 for cytochrome oxidase assembly is underscored by the finding that orthologs of these genes are present in the human genome (23Glerum D.M. Tzagoloff A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8452-8456Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 24Petruzzella V. Tiranti V. Fernandez P. Ianna P. Carrozzo R. Zeviani M. Genomics. 1998; 54: 494-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, cox10 and cox11mutants lack an optically detectable cytochrome c oxidase even though all of the structural subunits are synthesized (25Nobrega M.P. Nobrega F.G. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14220-14226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Tzagoloff A. Capitanio N. Nobrega M.P. Gatti D. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2759-2764Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The product of cox10 (Cox10p) has farnesyltransferase activity and catalyzes the conversion of protoheme to heme O, a precursor of heme A (27Saiki K. Mogi T. Ogura K. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26041-26044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Hill J. Goswitz V.C. Calhoun M. Garcia-Horsman J.A. Lemieux L. Alben J.O. Gennis R.B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11435-11440Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Because heme A is required for function and optical detection of the aa 3-type oxidase, the phenotype of the yeast cox10 mutant is readily understood. Based on the similar phenotypes of the cox10 andcox11 mutants in yeast, it has been suggested that Cox11p also functions in heme A biosynthesis (25Nobrega M.P. Nobrega F.G. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14220-14226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Tzagoloff A. Capitanio N. Nobrega M.P. Gatti D. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2759-2764Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), specifically in the formylation of the heme (29Tzagoloff A. Nobrega M. Gorman N. Sinclair P. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1993; 31: 593-598PubMed Google Scholar). Cox11p is not found in isolated cytochrome oxidase, and its sequence (22Cao J. Hosler J. Shapleigh J. Revzin A. Ferguson-Miller S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24273-24278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) does not reveal any homology to proteins of known function. Sequence analysis predicts that Cox11p of Rb. sphaeroides is a 20.7-kDa protein with a single transmembrane helix and a large globular domain (22Cao J. Hosler J. Shapleigh J. Revzin A. Ferguson-Miller S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24273-24278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunological studies in yeast have shown that Cox11p is localized to the mitochondrial inner membrane (26Tzagoloff A. Capitanio N. Nobrega M.P. Gatti D. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2759-2764Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Our investigation into the function of Cox11p has revealed an essential role for this protein in the formation of the CuB center. In addition, Cox11p was necessary for proper alignment of hemesa and a 3 and stability of the magnesium/manganese center. The presence of Cox11p was not required for heme A biosynthesis, heme A insertion, CuA assembly, and association of the subunits of the oxidase. Experiments altering the copy number of cox11 suggested that Cox11p was required in only substoichiometric amounts relative to the structural subunits. Horse heart cytochrome c (Sigma C-7752) was resuspended in distilled, deionized water and stored at −80 °C. l-α-Phosphatidylcholine (Sigma) was solubilized to 40 mg/ml in 2% sodium cholate (Anatrace).N-Dodecyl-β-d-maltoside was purchased from Anatrace. All other reagents were the highest grade available. Rb. sphaeroides strains were grown in Sistrom's media (30Sistrom W.R. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1960; 22: 778-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) as 500-ml cultures in 2-liter baffled flasks with vigorous shaking at 32 °C and supplemented with 1 μg/ml tetracycline and 50 μg/ml streptomycin and spectinomycin as necessary. To obtain cytochrome oxidase with manganese bound at the magnesium center, the media were supplemented with 0.7 mm MnSO4 (13Hosler J.P. Espe M.P. Zhen Y. Babcock G.T. Ferguson-Miller S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7586-7592Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested at late exponential phase (optical density at 660 nm of 1.0–1.6) and stored at −80 °C. Cytoplasmic membranes were prepared as described previously (1Hosler J.P. Fetter J. Tecklenburg M.M.J. Espe M. Lerma C. Ferguson-Miller S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24264-24272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the oxidases were purified on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) as in Zhenet al. (31Zhen Y. Qian J. Follmann K. Hayward T. Nilsson T. Dahn M. Hilmi Y. Hamer A.G. Hosler J.P. Ferguson-Miller S. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 13: 326-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) with the following exceptions. Dodecyl maltoside was added to a final concentration of 3% to solubilize the purified membranes, and the Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose slurry was added to the membrane solution at 1 ml per 1 mg oxidase. The purified proteins were frozen in liquid N2 and stored at −80 °C. Oxygen reduction assays were performed at 25 °C in a mixture of 2 pmol of wild-type or λCox11 oxidase or 40–60 pmol ΔCox11 oxidase, 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1% dodecyl maltoside, 3 mmascorbate, 0.6 mmtetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine, and 1 mg/ml phosphatidylcholine. The reactions were initiated by the addition of 0.5–100 μm horse heart cytochrome c. Oxygen consumption rates were measured using a Hansatech DW1 oxygen electrode unit, a CB1-D3 control box, and Minirec software (Hansatech) on an IBM-compatible computer. The data were imported into Origin 5.0 (Microcal) for subtraction of the slow rate of non-enzymatic reduction of O2 by ascorbate and calculation of initial slopes. Turnover numbers were calculated as described by Thompson and Ferguson-Miller (32Thompson D.A. Ferguson-Miller S. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 3178-3187Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). V max values were obtained by fitting plots of turnover numbers versus cytochromec concentration to a hyperbolic function. Optical spectra were recorded at 25 °C using a Hitachi U-3000 UV-visible spectrophotometer. Oxidase samples were reduced using solid sodium dithionite in 50 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% dodecyl maltoside, and the concentrations were determined using the extinction values of Vanneste (33Vanneste W.H. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 838-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The heme content of the oxidases was determined optically as in Hosler et al. (1Hosler J.P. Fetter J. Tecklenburg M.M.J. Espe M. Lerma C. Ferguson-Miller S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24264-24272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except that oxidase concentrations were determined from the absorbance at 280 nm using a derived extinction coefficient (ε280–312 nm = 358 mm−1 cm–1). Oxidase samples were prepared for metal content analysis by washing the proteins extensively in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 40 mmKCl, 25 mm EDTA and then reducing the EDTA concentration to 1 mm in a 50-kDa Ultrafree-4 filtration device (Millipore). Samples were concentrated to 25 μm, based on their α-band absorbance (peak around 605 nm), and shipped to the University of Georgia Chemical Analysis Laboratory for inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy. High level expression of wild-type mitochondrial-like cytochrome c oxidase of Rb. sphaeroides was driven by the expression vector pRKpAH1H32. This plasmid was a derivative of the broad host range vector pRK415-1 (34Keen N.T. Tamaki S. Kobayashi D. Trollinger D. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 70: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar) and is similar to pRK-pYJ123H (31Zhen Y. Qian J. Follmann K. Hayward T. Nilsson T. Dahn M. Hilmi Y. Hamer A.G. Hosler J.P. Ferguson-Miller S. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 13: 326-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), except that the coxI andcoxII/III operons are transcribed in opposite directions in pRKpAH1H32. The EcoRI-HindIII fragment of pRKpAH1H32 that contained both operons was inserted into pUC19 to create a smaller plasmid termed pAH1H32. An in-frame deletion in cox11 removed the codons for Thr-38 through Arg-139. Two MluI sites were introduced into pAH1H32 by site-directed mutagenesis (QuickChange, Stratagene) to create pLAJ198. With numbering from Ade of the initiation codon ATG ofRb. sphaeroides cox11 (22Cao J. Hosler J. Shapleigh J. Revzin A. Ferguson-Miller S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24273-24278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) the five nucleotide mutations were G114A, G115C, T118G, G414A, and G417C. The mutations were confirmed by dideoxy DNA sequencing (Sequenase, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The 300-base pair MluI fragment was then deleted by standard techniques (35Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) to create pLAJ200. TheEcoRI-HindIII fragment of pLAJ200 was inserted into pRK415-1 to create pRKpLAJ200, which was identical to pRKpAH1H32 except for the cox11 deletion. A control plasmid was used to test for effects on expression due to mutagenesis. The EcoRI-HindIII fragment of pLAJ198 was cloned into pRK415-1 to create pRKpLAJ198. This plasmid retained cox11 with two amino acid alterations (G39R and F40V) generated by the creation of the upstream MluI site. After conjugation (36Donohue T.J. Kaplan S. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 459-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) into Rb. sphaeroides strain YZ200, which lacks the genomic copy of the operon containing cox11(31Zhen Y. Qian J. Follmann K. Hayward T. Nilsson T. Dahn M. Hilmi Y. Hamer A.G. Hosler J.P. Ferguson-Miller S. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 13: 326-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), it was found that pRKpLAJ198 directed high level expression of normal cytochrome aa 3, similar to the overexpression vector pRKpAH1H32. Thus, the mutagenesis procedures themselves did not appear to have affected normal synthesis of cytochrome oxidase. In order to examine the role of Cox11p in oxidase assembly, the mitochondrial-like oxidase of Rb. sphaeroides was overexpressed in the presence of different copy numbers of cox11. A derivative of pRKpAH1H32, a plasmid containing both cox operons with their natural promoters, was prepared that contained a 300-base pair in-frame deletion in cox11. This Δcox11 plasmid, termed pRKpLAJ200, was conjugated into wild-type Rb. sphaeroides 2.4.1 (37Van Niel C.B. Bacteriol. Rev. 1944; 8: 1-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and YZ200, a strain in which the genomic copy of the coxII/III operon has been deleted (31Zhen Y. Qian J. Follmann K. Hayward T. Nilsson T. Dahn M. Hilmi Y. Hamer A.G. Hosler J.P. Ferguson-Miller S. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 13: 326-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), for overproduction and purification of cytochrome c oxidase. The enzyme isolated from 2.4.1 (wild type) cells harboring the Δcox11 plasmid was termed λCox11 (for “lowcox11”) because it was assembled in a strain with a single copy of cox11 (in the 2.4.1 genome) and about five plasmid-borne copies of coxI, coxII,cox10, and coxIII. Correspondingly, ΔCox11 oxidase was isolated from cells with no copies of cox11 by introducing the same Δcox11 plasmid into YZ200 (ΔcoxII/III). The purified wild-type oxidase used in this study was prepared from strain YZ300, which is deletion strain YZ200 containing pRK-pYJ123H (31Zhen Y. Qian J. Follmann K. Hayward T. Nilsson T. Dahn M. Hilmi Y. Hamer A.G. Hosler J.P. Ferguson-Miller S. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 13: 326-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The level of expression of ΔCox11 and λCox11 was compared with that of the wild-type oxidase (Fig. 1). Because ΔCox11 and λCox11 result from expression of the same plasmid (pRKpLAJ200) in two different host strains (YZ200 and 2.4.1), expression of the wild-type oxidase from the corresponding plasmid, pRKpAH1H32, was measured in both strains. Compared with the expression of the wild-type oxidase in the same host strain, λCox11 accumulated to 100% (Fig. 1, 3rd and 4th columns), whereas ΔCox11 accumulated to approximately 50% (Fig. 1, 1st and 2nd columns). Whencox11 is deleted in yeast, no cytochrome oxidase can be detected by optical spectroscopy (26Tzagoloff A. Capitanio N. Nobrega M.P. Gatti D. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2759-2764Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Thus, a mutation that causes a catastrophic phenotype in yeast had a less severe defect in Rb. sphaeroides. The reduction in oxidase expression observed in the absence of cox11 was completely reversed by a single copy ofcox11 (Fig. 1), suggesting that Cox11p was not required in stoichiometric amounts with the structural subunits for oxidase assembly. The absolute reduced spectrum of purified ΔCox11, but not of λCox11, revealed a 3–4 nm blue shift in both the α (602 versus 605 nm for wild type) and Soret (441 versus 444 nm) peaks (Fig. 2). Because the α band is primarily due to absorption by heme a, whereas the Soret band includes roughly equal contributions from both hemes a anda 3 (33Vanneste W.H. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 838-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 38Liao G.-L. Palmer G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1274: 109-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), the observed shifts indicated altered environments around both heme centers in ΔCox11. Indeed, resonance Raman analysis (not shown) revealed a disturbed hemea 3 environment in ΔCox11, similar to mutant oxidases containing alterations around heme a 3(39Shapleigh J.P. Hosler J.P. Tecklenburg M.M.J. Kim Y. Babcock G.T. Gennis R.B. Ferguson-Miller S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4786-4790Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In contrast, there was no evidence for disturbance of the heme centers in λCox11 by optical or resonance Raman spectroscopy. The pyridine hemochrome spectrum of ΔCox11 was indistinguishable from that of heme extracted from the purified wild-type or λCox11 oxidases (Fig. 3), indicating that ΔCox11 contained bona fide heme A. This argued against a role for Cox11p in heme A synthesis. Furthermore, the heme A content of ΔCox11 was nearly the same as that of the wild-type oxidase (Table I), indicating that Cox11p was not required for insertion of heme A during oxidase assembly.Table IProsthetic group content and O 2 reduction activity of oxidases assembled with varying amounts of Cox11pOxidaseHeme A:oxidaseCu:FeV maxs −1Wild type2.20 ± 0.20 (n = 4, 2 preparations)1.62 ± 0.11 (n = 3)1700ΔCox111.91 ± 0.08 (n = 4, 3 preparations)0.99 ± 0.08 (n = 3)<100λCox112.21 ± 0.08 (n = 4, 2 preparations)1.48 (n = 1)1500 Open table in a new tab SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of purified ΔCox11 and λCox11 revealed that both protein complexes contained all three of the structural subunits (Fig. 4). This showed that Cox11p was not essential for association of the oxidase subunits. The O2reduction activity of cytochrome c oxidase purified from strains with varying amounts of cox11 is listed in Table I. The ΔCox11 oxidase was unable to reduce oxygen efficiently. Measurable activity (80 s−1) using nearly saturating amounts of cytochrome c (90 μm) was observed in only one of three ΔCox11 preparations. The high activity of λCox11 (Table I) indicated that substoichiometric amounts of Cox11p were sufficient for assembly of an active oxidase. This was consistent with the high expression of λCox11 (Fig. 1). Because both of the heme centers were present in ΔCox11, the loss of activity suggested that one of the other metal centers was disrupted. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR) is a sensitive method for examining the environments of CuA and heme a of oxidized cytochrome oxidase, and it is also used to detect the absence of CuB (40Aasa R. Albracht S.P.J. Falk K.-E. Lanne B. Vanngard T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 422: 260-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The heme a 3 and CuB centers are normally EPR-silent due to spin coupling of the metals. However, in the absence of CuB a strong signal for five-coordinate, high spin heme a 3 is seen at approximately g = 6 (41Hunter D.J.B. Moody A.J. Rich P.R. Ingledew W.J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The ΔCox11 spectrum (Fig. 5) showed a signal for high spin heme a 3 at g = 6 with an amplitude similar to oxidases known to lack CuB (41Hunter D.J.B. Moody A.J. Rich P.R. Ingledew W.J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). This strongly suggested that ΔCox11 lacked CuB. In contrast, signals in the g = 2 region of the EPR spectrum showed that ΔCox11 contained wild-type amounts of a normal CuAcenter. The extent to which CuB was lost from ΔCox11 was determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic absorption spectroscopy. The wild-type and λCox11 oxidases gave Cu:Fe values of about 1.5 (Table I) as expected for an enzyme with three coppers (CuB and the di-copper CuA center) and two hemes (7Steffens G.C.M. Biewald R. Buse G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 164: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The Cu:Fe value of ΔCox11 was 0.99 (Table I), suggesting complete loss of CuB. As predicted from the heme A content, iron levels were normal in all three of the oxidases (data not shown). In addition to loss of CuB, the EPR spectra showed significant disturbance of the heme a environment of ΔCox11 and, to a lesser extent, of λCox11. The wild-type hemea signal at g = 2.83 (g z) was replaced by a broad signal around g = 3 in ΔCox11 (Fig. 5). Based on previous analysis of the heme a signals of the mitochondrial-like oxidase of Rb. sphaeroides, this change indicated disruption of the hydrogen bonds to the histidine ligands of heme a in ΔCox11 (1Hosler J.P. Fetter J. Tecklenburg M.M.J. Espe M. Lerma C. Ferguson-Miller S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24264-24272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The blue-shifted optical spectrum of ΔCox11 (Fig. 2) was consistent with this interpretation. The loss of strong hydrogen bonds to the heme a ligands will cause the electron density on the heme iron to decrease, thus forcing the electronic transitions of heme a in ΔCox11 to occur at higher energy (see Ref. 1Hosler J.P. Fetter J. Tecklenburg M.M.J. Espe M. Lerma C. Ferguson-Miller S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24264-24272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The heme a signals of ΔCox11 (g z = 2.98 and g y = 2.30) were also diminished in intensity due to incomplete oxidation of hemea in resting ΔCox11 (data not shown). In order to examine the magnesium/manganese center of cytochrome oxidase, ΔCox11 and λCox11 were prepared from bacteria grown in media supplemented with manganese salts. This allows substitution of manganese, which is EPR-visible, for magnesium at its binding site between subunits I and II (8Ostermeier C. Harrenga A. Ermler U. Michel H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10547-10553Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar, 12Tsukihara T. Aoyama H. Yamashita E. Tomizaki T. Yamaguchi H. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Nakashima R. Yaono R. Yoshikawa S.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7593-7602Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Comparison of the EPR spectra of ΔCox11 and λCox11 (Fig. 6) showed that much less manganese was inserted into the oxidase in the absence of Cox11p. EPR spectra of acid-extracted Mn2+ (not shown) indicated that ΔCox11 bound approximately 15% of the manganese of λCox11. Similarly, metal analysis showed that reduced levels of magnesium (29 ± 11% of the normal oxidase) were incorporated into ΔCox11 purified from cells grown in normal media. Previous work in yeast identified Cox11p as one of several proteins required for the post-translational stages of the assembly of cytochrome c oxidase (26Tzagoloff A. Capitanio N. Nobrega M.P. Gatti D. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2759-2764Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 29Tzagoloff A. Nobrega M. Gorman N. Sinclair P. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1993; 31: 593-598PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we have further defined the role of Cox11p by characterizing the oxidase that was synthesized in its absence. Due to the presence of an alternative cytochromec oxidase in Rb. sphaeroides (43Garcia-Horsman J.A. Berry E. Shapleigh J.P. Alben J.O. Gennis R.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3113-3119Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 44Gray K.A. Grooms M. Myllykallio H. Moomaw C. Slaughter C. Daldal F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3120-3127Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), it is possible to grow strains without the mitochondrial-like oxidase; this permits the study of inactive oxidases. Cells in which most of thecox11 gene was deleted produced a partially assembled oxidase, termed ΔCox11, that contained all three structural subunits, both hemes a and a 3, and the CuA center. Contrary to a previous proposal based on experiments in yeast (26Tzagoloff A. Capitanio N. Nobrega M.P. Gatti D. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2759-2764Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 29Tzagoloff A. Nobrega M. Gorman N. Sinclair P. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1993; 31: 593-598PubMed Google Scholar), the presence of the heme A centers in ΔCox11 argued against a role for bacterial Cox11p in heme A synthesis. Roles for Cox11p in the association of the oxidase subunits, insertion of heme A, and the formation of the CuA center were also eliminated. The principal defects identified in ΔCox11 were diminished accumulation in the membrane, the absence of CuB, a 70–85% decrease in magnesium/manganese content, and altered heme environments. The complete absence of CuB indicated that Cox11p normally functions in the insertion of this metal. In ΔCox11, the magnesium/manganese center was incompletely formed, and perturbation of the heme centers was observed. Therefore, the insertion of CuB is likely to facilitate the stable formation of other structures in subunit I. This seems reasonable because the metal centers of subunit I are close together. For example, CuBand the magnesium atom are only 13.5 Å apart, and imidazole side chains of ligands from each of these centers come within 7 Å (6Yoshikawa S. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Nakashima R. Yaono R.

Ermler U. Michel H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10547-10553Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). Cox11p may be a copper chaperone specific for the CuBcenter of cytochrome oxidase. Specific copper chaperones are required for the assembly of metalloprotein copper centers. For example, CopY, a repressor in Enterococcus hirae, accepts copper from CopZ but not from other copper chaperones (45Cobine P. Wickramasinghe W.A. Harrison M.D. Weber T. Solioz M. Dameron C.T. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 27-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of Cox11p orthologues from several species reveals a conserved CFCF motif that resembles the metal-binding regions of other metal chaperones (45Cobine P. Wickramasinghe W.A.

Science. 1997; 278: 853-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). However, a role for Cox11p in formation of CuB does not require it to bind copper. It is also possible that by interacting with subunit I, Cox11p permits a conformation receptive for copper delivery by a different protein. The final position of the CuBcenter is not solvent-accessible and is within the transmembrane region of subunit I (3Iwata S. Ostermeier C. Ludwig B. Michel H. Nature. 1995; 376: 660-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1985) Google Scholar, 4Tsukihara T. Aoyama H. Yamashita E. Tomizaki T. Yamaguchi H. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Nakashima R. Yaono R. Yoshikawa S.

A. 1997; 94: 10547-10553Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). Thus, the involvement of an integral membrane protein such as Cox11p in the assembly of this site was not unexpected. The level to which ΔCox11 accumulated in the bacterial membrane was one-half that of the normal oxidase that assembled in the presence of Cox11p (Fig. 1). An oxidase lacking CuB would be predicted to have reduced stability at the hemea 3-CuB center. This, in turn, could lead to more rapid degradation of the oxidase resulting in a lower steady-state concentration in the membrane. From a different perspective, it is significant that ΔCox11 did accumulate to relatively high levels. This raises the intriguing possibility that ΔCox11 may be a normal, relatively stable assembly intermediate. Thus, the insertion of CuB may be a late step in oxidase assembly, following heme A insertion and the association of subunit I with subunits II and III. In yeast, the deletion of cox11 eliminates the accumulation of optically detectable cytochrome oxidase in the mitochondrial membrane (26Tzagoloff A. Capitanio N. Nobrega M.P. Gatti D. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2759-2764Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The different results seen in yeast and Rb. sphaeroides are likely a consequence of the complexity of the mitochondrial oxidase. In the mitochondria, association of several nuclear-encoded accessory subunits follows assembly of the catalytic core (17Nijtmans L.G.J. Taanman J.-W. Muijsers A.O. Speijer D. Van Den Bogert C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Despite the near structural identity of the simpler bacterial oxidases and the mitochondrially encoded core subunits of the eukaryotic oxidase, the latter enzyme is not structurally stable in the absence of the accessory subunits (49Poyton R.O. McEwen J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 563-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). In this respect, bacteria are likely to be of greater utility in elucidating the mechanisms of the assembly of the catalytic core of cytochrome oxidase. In summary, the results presented here suggest that ΔCox11 has a primary defect in CuB insertion, with secondary effects being the loss of metal from the magnesium/manganese center and misalignment of the hemes. We propose a role for Cox11p in the insertion of CuB into the aa 3-type cytochrome c oxidase at a late stage in assembly.

Like other STAT proteins, STAT5 undergoes a rapid activation and inactivation cycle upon cytokine stimulation. Tyrosine phosphorylation and dephosphorylation are critical in regulating STAT5 activity. A number of protein tyrosine kinases have been shown to phosphorylate STAT5; however, the phosphatases responsible for STAT5 dephosphorylation remain unidentified. Using CTLL-20 as a model system, we provide evidence that tyrosine dephosphorylation of STAT5 subsequent to IL-2-induced phosphorylation occurs in the absence of STAT5 nuclear translocation and new protein synthesis. Nevertheless, down-regulation of the upstream Janus kinase activity during the deactivation cycle of IL-2-induced signaling does involve new protein synthesis. These findings point to the constitutive presence of STAT5 tyrosine phosphatase activity in the cytosolic compartment. We further demonstrate that SHP-2, but not SHP-1, directly dephosphorylates STAT5 in an in vitro tyrosine phosphatase assay with purified proteins. Furthermore, tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT5 associates with the substrate-trapping mutant (Cys → Ser) of SHP-2 but not SHP-1. These results suggest a potential role for cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine phosphatases in directly dephosphorylating STAT proteins and in maintaining a basal steady state level of STAT activity.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4361-4369Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Two Stat5genes encode proteins STAT5a and STAT5b, which share approximately 95% amino acid identity (6Liu X. Robinson G.W.

In addition to prolactin, both STAT5a and STAT5b are activated by a number of cytokines, including growth hormone, erythropoietin, thrombopoietin, interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-3, IL-5, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15, and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (4Leonard W.J.

Several mechanisms have been demonstrated that may negatively regulate STAT5 activity. (i) Dephosphorylation of the highly conserved tyrosine residue in STAT5 (Tyr-694 in STAT5a and Tyr-699 in STAT5b) would result in the loss of its dimerization and DNA binding activity (5Gouilleux F.

In contrast to protein-tyrosine kinases phosphorylating STAT5, the subcellular localization and the identity of protein-tyrosine phosphatase(s) in dephosphorylating STAT5, as well as other STAT proteins, remain largely unknown. In this report, we examine STAT5 regulation in response to IL-2 using an IL-2-dependent CTLL-20 cell line as a model system. By blocking nuclear transport, we are able to specifically analyze the regulation of cytoplasmic STAT5 proteins. Furthermore, we establish an in vitro system to characterize potential STAT5 protein-tyrosine phosphatases. Maintenance of the IL-2-dependent cell line CTLL-20 (15Yu C.-L. Burakoff S.J. J. Biol.

Digitonin-permeabilized cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in ice-cold RPMI 1640. Nonhydrolyzable GTPγS was added to a final concentration of 200 μm. Cells were incubated on ice for 15 min and then stimulated with 30 units/ml IL-2 at 37 °C. Transient transfection of COS-7 cells was performed as described previously using 2.5 μg of eukaryotic glutathioneS-transferase (GST) expression vector pEBG (24Pratt J.C. Weiss M. Sieff C.A.

Recombinant human IL-2 was a gift of Dr. J. Sepinwall (Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., Nutley, NJ). Digitonin (high purity) and GTPγS were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Cycloheximide, Me2SO, genistein, and staurosporine were from Sigma. Anti-Jak-immunoprecipitating antibodies and anti-phospho-STAT5 (Y694/Y699) antibody were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-STAT5 and anti-Lck antibodies used for immunoprecipitation as well as anti-Jak3, anti-Eps15, anti-Sp1, and anti-GST immunoblotting antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-STAT5, anti-Jak1, and anti-Lck antibodies used for immunoblotting and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine antibody RC20H were from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Anti-STAT5 antibodies used for immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting recognize both STAT5a and STAT5b. Cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and then resuspended in hypotonic buffer (42 mm KCl, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 5 mmMgCl2 and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After a 15-min incubation on ice, cells were homogenized by passing through a 30-gauge needle 10 times. Nuclei and unbroken cells were separated at 600 × g for 5 min as the low speed pellet. The postnuclear supernatant was centrifuged at 150,000 × gfor 30 min at 4 °C to further separate the membrane fraction from cytosol. The low speed pellet was resuspended in hypotonic buffer containing 0.25 m sucrose, followed by centrifugation at 1,300 × g for 5 min to remove unbroken cells and cytoplasmic contaminants. Proteins were then extracted from purified nuclei with high-salt buffer (13Yu C.-L. Jove R. Burakoff S.J. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 5206-5210PubMed Google Scholar, 15Yu C.-L. Burakoff S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14017-14020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Preparation of whole cell lysates, immunoprecipitation, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and immunoblotting were done essentially as described before (13Yu C.-L. Jove R. Burakoff S.J. J.

STAT5 or Lck immune complexes were incubated with GST fusion proteins containing full-length SHP-1 or SHP-2 as described elsewhere (26Gu H. Griffin J.D. Neel B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16421-16430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To determine the time course of the IL-2-induced STAT5 activation and inactivation cycle, IL-2-deprived CTLL-20 cells were stimulated with IL-2 for 5 min, 15 min, 30 min, and 1 h. As shown in Fig. 1, IL-2 induced rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of cytosolic STAT5 within 5 min, and the levels of tyrosine phosphorylation returned to base line after 1 h. Like other cytokine-mediated STAT activation (27Herrington J. Rui L. Luo G. Yu- Lee L. Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5138-5145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), however, IL-2 also induced rapid and transient nuclear translocation of STAT5 (data not shown; also see Fig. 2 B). Therefore, to address the possibility that STAT5 may be dephosphorylated in the cytoplasm, we decided to specifically examine the regulation of cytoplasmic STAT5 by blocking STAT5 nuclear translocation.FIG. 2Nuclear translocation is not essential for STAT5 tyrosine dephosphorylation following IL-2-induced phosphorylation. Panel A, equal numbers of IL-2-deprived CTLL-20 cells were either untreated (lanes 1-7) or pretreated with GTPγS following permeabilization (lanes 8-14). Whole cell lysates were prepared from cells either left unstimulated or stimulated with IL-2 for 5 min to 2 h (120′). Anti-STAT5 immunoprecipitates (IP) were probed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody RC20H (upper panel) or anti-STAT5 antibody (lower panel) as described in the legend to Fig. 1. Panel B, equal numbers of IL-2-deprived CTLL-20 cells were pretreated in the absence (lanes 1 and2) or presence (lanes 3–5) of GTPγS and then either left unstimulated (lane 1) or stimulated with IL-2 for 15 min (lanes 2 and 3), 30 min (lane 4), or 1 h (lane 5). Proteins in the nuclear extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-STAT5 antibody, subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and then analyzed by anti-STAT5 immunoblotting. Panel C, cytosolic (cyt) and nuclear (nuc) fractions were prepared from IL-2-deprived CTLL-20 cells without (lanes 1 and 3) or with GTPγS pretreatment (lanes 2 and 4). Equivalent amounts of cytosolic and nuclear proteins were resolved by 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to membranes, and then probed with anti-Eps15 antibody (αEps15).Panel D, same as panel C, except that anti-Sp1 antibody (αSp1) was used for immunoblotting. The arrows indicate the predicted sizes of proteins of interest.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) It is known that GTP hydrolysis is essential for active nuclear import of macromolecules (28Mattaj I.W. Englmeier L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 265-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). Indeed, we observed that pretreatment with the nonhydrolyzable GTP analog, GTPγS, blocked STAT5 nuclear translocation upon stimulation of CTLL-20 cells with IL-2 for 15 min to 1 h (Fig. 2 B, compare lanes 2 and3–5). Therefore, GTPγS blocks STAT5 nuclear import instead of simply delaying the time course of STAT5 nuclear translocation. Nevertheless, IL-2-induced STAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation and, most importantly, the subsequent dephosphorylation of STAT5 occurred without nuclear translocation (Fig. 2 A). For controls, cytosolic and nuclear fractions prepared from cells with or without permeabilization and GTPγS treatment were analyzed by immunoblotting for Eps15, a cytosolic marker, and Sp1, a nuclear marker (29Muller H. Moroni M.C. Vigo E. Petersen B.O. Bartek J. Helin K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5508-5520Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, C and D, there was very little cross-contamination from either fraction, indicating that the nuclear membranes were still intact after permeabilization. These results suggest that nuclear translocation is not a prerequisite for STAT5 tyrosine dephosphorylation. They also point to the existence of a cytosolic protein-tyrosine phosphatase(s) capable of dephosphorylating STAT5. Mitogen-induced expression of protein phosphatase has been shown to function as a negative feedback control mechanism (30Sun H. Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K. Cell. 1993; 75: 487-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar). To determine if STAT5 tyrosine phosphatase activity needs to be induced by cytokines, we examined the kinetics of IL-2-induced STAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequent dephosphorylation in the absence of new protein synthesis and continuous kinase activity. IL-2-deprived CTLL-20 cells were first pretreated with cycloheximide to block new protein synthesis (Fig. 3 A). Cells were either left unstimulated (lane 1) or stimulated with IL-2 for 15 min to accumulate a pool of tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT5 (lane 2). Genistein, staurosporine, or Me2SO carrier control were then added to block further kinase activity that would phosphorylate STAT5 on tyrosine residues. Without protein kinase inhibitors, IL-2-induced STAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation was sustained in CTLL-20 pretreated with cycloheximide (lanes 3-6). In contrast, in the presence of genistein (lanes 7-10) or staurosporine (lanes 11-14), STAT5 was rapidly tyrosine-dephosphorylated. To further confirm the presence of protein-tyrosine phosphatase activity in cycloheximide-treated cells, pervanadate was used to inhibit phosphatase activity before IL-2 stimulation of CTLL-20 cells. As shown in Fig. 3 B, IL-2-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 was sustained without continuous kinase and phosphatase activities (lanes 3-6). These results suggest that STAT5 tyrosine phosphatase(s) is constitutively present, and the steady state level of STAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation is predominantly determined by the upstream kinase activity. Therefore, the negative feedback control mechanisms regulating STAT activity are directed mostly at preventing further STAT phosphorylation, as described in other studies (18Aman M.J. Migone T.-S. Sasaki A. Ascherman D.P. Zhu M. Soldaini E. Imada K. Miyajima A. Yoshimura A. Leonard W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30266-30272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 19Cohney S.J. Sanden D. Cacalano N.A. Yoshimura A. Mui A. Migone T.S. Johnston J.A. Mol. Cell.

Blood. 1997; 89: 3148-3154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In response to IL-2 stimulation, Jak1 and Jak3 are the two major protein-tyrosine kinases in phosphorylating STAT5 proteins (15Yu C.-L. Burakoff S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14017-14020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). To address the possibility that Jak1 and Jak3 contribute to sustained IL-2-induced STAT5 phosphorylation in the presence of cycloheximide (Fig. 3 A,lanes 2–6), we examined the kinetics of IL-2-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak1 and Jak3. As described previously, Jak1 and Jak3 are rapidly and transiently phosphorylated on tyrosines upon IL-2 stimulation (Fig. 4,panels A and B, respectively, lanes 1–7). In the absence of new protein synthesis, however, IL-2-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak1 and Jak3 was prolonged (Fig. 4, panels A and B, respectively,lanes 8–14). This is consistent with the reported negative feedback control mechanism in down-modulating Jak kinase activity (19Cohney S.J. Sanden D. Cacalano N.A. Yoshimura A. Mui A. Migone T.S. Johnston J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4980-4988Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these results suggest that, upon IL-2 stimulation of cycloheximide-pretreated cells, sustained elevation of Jak kinase activity is involved in maintaining a high steady state level of STAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation. To further identify the cytosolic STAT5 tyrosine phosphatase, we analyzed tyrosine dephosphorylation of STAT5 within a purified cytoplasmic fraction in vitro. Consistent with the existence of constitutive STAT5 tyrosine phosphatase activity in the cytoplasm, Fig. 5 demonstrates that tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT5 in the cytosolic fraction prepared from IL-2-stimulated CTLL-20 could be dephosphorylated in vitroin the absence of nuclei. Sodium orthovanadate completely inhibited STAT5 tyrosine dephosphorylation (compare lanes 5 and6), confirming the involvement of protein-tyrosine phosphatases. No further enhancement of STAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation was observed in the presence of sodium orthovanadate (comparelanes 1 and 6), suggesting that protein-tyrosine kinases capable of phosphorylating STAT5 were not active under these conditions. Not only soluble STAT5, but STAT5 immunoprecipitates on protein A-Sepharose could also be tyrosine dephosphorylated when mixed with cytosol prepared from CTLL-20 or other T cell lines, although to a lesser extent (data not shown). It is possible that the tyrosine residues on immobilized STAT5 were not completely accessible to protein-tyrosine phosphatases. Cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2 have both been implicated in the regulation of Jak-STAT-signaling pathways (4Leonard W.J. O'Shea J.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 293-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1493) Google Scholar). To determine if SHP-1 or SHP-2 can directly dephosphorylate STAT5 on tyrosines, STAT5 immunoprecipitates prepared from IL-2-stimulated CTLL-20 were incubated with purified GST-SHP-1 or GST-SHP-2 fusion proteins from 30 min to 2 h. As shown in Fig. 6 A, GST-SHP-2 dephosphorylated immobilized STAT5 within 30 min (lanes 7-10). In contrast, there was no detectable tyrosine dephosphorylation of STAT5 immunoprecipitates by GST-SHP-1 throughout the time course (lanes 3-6). As a control, immobilized STAT5 did not undergo tyrosine dephosphorylation in the absence of exogenously added phosphatases, indicating that no phosphatase activity was co-immunoprecipitated with STAT5 (lane 2). Quantification of properly exposed films, after normalization to the amount of STAT5 proteins, revealed a 5-fold reduction on the levels of STAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation by GST-SHP-2 as compared with buffer control and GST-SHP-1. To determine whether SHP-2 can dephosphorylate the critical tyrosine residues of STAT5 proteins, an antibody against STAT5 phosphorylated on Tyr-694/Tyr-699 was used in immunoblotting after the in vitro phosphatase assay. As shown in Fig. 6 B, dephosphorylation of Tyr-694/Tyr-699 by SHP-2 occurred within 5 min. The observation that dephosphorylation of Tyr-694/Tyr-699 by SHP-2 (Fig. 6 B) was less than overall tyrosine dephosphorylation of STAT5 by SHP-2 (Fig. 6 A) raises the possibility that SHP-2 may dephosphorylate other tyrosine residues of STAT5 proteins. The inability to completely dephosphorylate STAT5 under these conditions could be due to limited accessibility of the tyrosine residues on immobilized STAT5 as described above. To confirm that GST-SHP-1 is functional, we examined its phosphatase activity toward Lck, a known substrate of SHP-1 (31Lorenz U. Ravichandran K.S. Burakoff S.J. Neel B.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9624-9629Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Fig. 6 C shows that GST-SHP-1 rapidly dephosphorylated Lck immunoprecipitates prepared from LSTRA cells expressing high levels of tyrosine-phosphorylated Lck (13Yu C.-L. Jove R. Burakoff S.J. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 5206-5210PubMed Google Scholar) (lane 3). Tyrosine dephosphorylation of Lck by GST-SHP-2, on the other hand, was much weaker (lane 4). As a control, there was no phosphatase activity co-immunoprecipitated with Lck (lane 2). Therefore, under the in vitro conditions described here, purified GST-SHP-1 and GST-SHP-2 preferentially dephosphorylate Lck and STAT5, respectively. We did not observe the association of SHP-2 and STAT5 in IL-2-stimulated CTLL-20 cells (not shown). This is consistent with the finding that no phosphatase activity was co-immunoprecipitated with STAT5 from IL-2-stimulated cells as described above. One possible explanation is that this enzyme-substrate interaction is not stable. Therefore, we used a substrate-trapping mutant (Cys → Ser) to stabilize the interaction between SHP-2 and STAT5. As shown by glutathione pull-down experiments (Fig. 7), a GST-SHP-2 substrate-trapping mutant stably associated with tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT5 from IL-2-stimulated CTLL-20 cytosol (compare lanes 2 and5). Consistent with the inability of SHP-1 to dephosphorylate STAT5, there was no significant association of the GST-SHP-1 substrate-trapping mutant (Cys → Ser) with tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT5 (lane 6). As a control, GST alone did not associate with STAT5 proteins (lanes 1 and3). These results further establish that STAT5 can be a direct substrate of SHP-2. Although the mechanisms whereby STAT proteins become activated are being delineated, much less is known about their subsequent nucleocytoplasmic trafficking and deactivation (4Leonard W.J. O'Shea J.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 293-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1493) Google Scholar). Nuclear transport of a large number of cellular proteins, including transcription factors, involves the Ran/importin active transport system (28Mattaj I.W. Englmeier L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 265-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). Active nuclear transport requires the interaction between importin and nuclear localization sequences on the target protein and is mediated by the GTPase activity of Ran. We show here that nuclear translocation of STAT5 following IL-2 stimulation can be inhibited by a nonhydrolyzable GTP analog (Fig. 2). Consistent with our finding, there are reports demonstrating the involvement of Ran/importin in interferon-γ-dependent nuclear import of STAT1 (32Sekimoto T. Nakajima K. Tachibana T. Hirano T. Yoneda Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31017-31020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 33Torgerson T.R. Colosia A.D. Donahue J.P. Lin Y.Z. Hawiger J. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6084-6092PubMed Google Scholar). It is, therefore, very likely that nuclear translocation of other STAT family members also requires GTP hydrolysis. However, there is no discernible nuclear localization sequences found on STAT proteins, and the precise mechanism underlying nuclear import of STAT remains unclear (4Leonard W.J. O'Shea J.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 293-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1493) Google Scholar). Deactivation of tyrosine-phosphorylated nuclear STAT proteins involves both tyrosine dephosphorylation and nuclear export back to the cytoplasm for a subsequent cycle of activation/inactivation (34Haspel R.L. Salditt-Georgieff M. Darnell Jr., J.E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6262-6268Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The concomitant tyrosine dephosphorylation and export of nuclear STAT proteins makes it very difficult to determine their sequential order. Using chimeric STAT1 with the amino-terminal sequences from STAT2 or STAT5, Strehlow and Schindler (35Strehlow I. Schindler C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28049-28056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) showed a correlation between a defect in nuclear translocation and prolonged activation of the chimeric STAT proteins. However, a causal relationship cannot be established because the chimeric STAT mutants are intrinsically deficient for tyrosine dephosphorylation. This is consistent with the important role of the amino-terminal domain of STAT1 in regulating its tyrosine dephosphorylation (36Shuai K. Liao J. Song M.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4932-4941Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In contrast, by analyzing endogenous wild-type STAT5 both in vivo (Fig. 2) and in vitro (Fig. 5), we clearly demonstrate the existence of cytosolic protein-tyrosine phosphatases in dephosphorylating STAT5 and possibly other STAT family members. Our results indicate that nuclear translocation of STAT5 is not essential for its tyrosine dephosphorylation (Fig. 2). It should be emphasized, however, that our data do not exclude the possible role of a nuclear protein-tyrosine phosphatase in STAT5 regulation. Cytoplasmic and nuclear protein-tyrosine phosphatases may cooperatively contribute to constitutive STAT5 dephosphorylation in their respective subcellular compartments. Alternatively, protein-tyrosine phosphatases may shuttle between cytoplasm and nucleus. It has been proposed that nuclear translocation of STAT family members may involve other cellular proteins, such as cytokine receptor complexes, as chaperones (37Johnson H.M. Torres B.A. Green M.M. Szente B.E. Siler K.I. Larkin III, J. Subramaniam P.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). It is possible that cytosolic phosphatase translocates to the nucleus with the associated STAT proteins (38Ram P.A. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17694-17702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). However, we have not been able to detect significant amounts of SHP-2 translocation into the nucleus in IL-2-stimulated CTLL-20 cells (data not shown). Among all known cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine phosphatases, SHP-1 and SHP-2 are widely implicated in modulating the Jak-STAT pathway. SHP-1 and SHP-2 have been shown to negatively (38Ram P.A. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17694-17702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and positively (39Gadina M. Stancato L.M. Bacon C.M. Larner A.C. O'Shea J.J. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4657-4661PubMed Google Scholar, 40Berchtold S. Volarevic S. Moriggl R. Mercep M. Groner B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 556-567Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) regulate STAT5 activity, respectively. However, there are also reports demonstrating the opposite effects (41You M. Zhao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23376-23381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 42Servidei T. Aoki Y. Lewis S.E. Symes A. Fink J.S. Reeves S.A. J. Biol.

Biol. 1997; 7: 697-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Furthermore, because both SHP-1 and SHP-2 have been shown to modulate tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak kinases (4Leonard W.J. O'Shea J.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 293-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1493) Google Scholar), which regulate downstream STAT proteins, it is difficult to evaluate the direct effects of SHP-1 and SHP-2 on STAT5. By using purified SHP-1 and SHP-2 proteins, we demonstrate here that SHP-2, but not SHP-1, directly dephosphorylates STAT5 in vitro. Additionally, our results indicate that there is substrate specificity for protein-tyrosine phosphatases, and our in vitro system can be used to identify other potential STAT5 tyrosine phosphatases. Our finding that cycloheximide pretreatment stabilizes IL-2-induced STAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 3) supports the involvement of a negative feedback loop in down-regulating Jak-STAT signaling, such as the induction of Jak-binding protein or cytokine-inducible SH2-containing proteins (18Aman M.J. Migone T.-S. Sasaki A. Ascherman D.P. Zhu M. Soldaini E. Imada K. Miyajima A. Yoshimura A. Leonard W.J. J. Biol.

Blood. 1997; 89: 3148-3154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The inability to induce Jak-binding protein and cytokine-inducible SH2-containing protein expression could result in constitutive Jak kinase activity and continuous recruitment of STAT5 to the IL-2 receptor complex, where the constitutive Jak kinase resides. Consistent with this hypothesis, we observed prolonged IL-2-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak1 and Jak3 in the presence of cycloheximide (Fig. 4). It is unlikely, however, that STAT5 tyrosine phosphatase is part of the negative feedback control because tyrosine dephosphorylation of STAT5 does not require new protein synthesis (Fig. 3). This is consistent with the constitutive presence of SHP-2 in the cells before or after cytokine stimulation (44Kim H. Baumann H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5326-5338Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that SHP-2 may be one of the protein-tyrosine phosphatases that contribute to constitutive dephosphorylation of cytosolic STAT5. Consistent with the constitutive presence of active phosphatases, previous studies have shown that pervanadate treatment alone could induce STAT activation in resting cells (45Barillas-Mury C. Han Y.S. Seeley D. Kafatos F.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 959-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 46Sweitzer S.M. Calvo S. Kraus M.H. Finbloom D.S. Larner A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16510-16513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Following IL-2 stimulation, however, the highly induced kinase activity of Jak1 and Jak3 overcomes the phosphatase activity. This shift of balance results in the accumulation of tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT5, nuclear translocation, and regulation of gene expression. Subsequently, inhibition of Jak kinase activity through negative feedback control and other mechanisms allows the phosphatase activity to become predominant and reduce the steady state of STAT5 phosphorylation to basal level. The observation that STAT activity is controlled by the duration and intensity of upstream Jak kinase activity over the background of constitutive dephosphorylation is not restricted to IL-2-dependent STAT5 regulation. Similar results have been reported for interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 and STAT5 in response to interferon-α and growth hormone, respectively (47Lee C.K. Bluyssen H.A.R. Levy D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21872-21877Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 48Gebert C.A. Park S.H. Waxman D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 400-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Therefore, the delicate balance between kinase and phosphatase activity could be the key determinants in defining steady state activity of various STAT family members. We thank Drs. H. Gu and B. Neel for GST-SHP-1 and GST-SHP-2 fusion proteins and GST fusion constructs expressing the Cys → Ser substrate-trapping mutants of SHP-1 and SHP-2 as well as their helpful comments on the manuscript."

TLE proteins are co-expressed with the Runt-related proteins, Cbfa1 and Cbfa2/AML1 (AML1), in a variety of cell types (7Okuda T. van Deursen J. Hiebert S.W. Grosveld G. Downing J.R.

Dyn. 1995; 203: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In addition, AML1 and TLE proteins can physically interact with each other (28Levanon D. Goldstein R.E. Bernstein Y. Tang H. Goldenberg D. Stifani S. Paroush Z. Groner Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11590-11595Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Furthermore, transient transfection studies in mammalian cells have shown that TLE proteins can inhibit the transactivation mediated by both Cbfa1 and AML1 (14Thirunavukkarasu K. Mahajan M. McLarren K.W. Stifani S. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4197-4208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Levanon D. Goldstein R.E. Bernstein Y. Tang H. Goldenberg D. Stifani S. Paroush Z. Groner Y.

Together, these findings strongly suggest that TLE proteins are involved in the regulation of the transcriptional functions of mammalian Runt-related proteins. Studies in Drosophila have also implicated a second evolutionarily conserved family of transcription factors in the regulation of the functions of Runt-related proteins. Specifically, the basic helix loop helix proteins of the DrosophilaHairy/Enhancer of split (HES) family are co-expressed with Groucho and Runt in a variety of cell types and physically interact with Groucho (18Aronson B.D.

Moreover, genetic studies in Drosophilashow that runt and HES genes contribute to common gene regulatory events important for sex determination and segmentation (30Jimenez G. Pinchin S.H. Ish-Horowicz D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7088-7098Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 31Tsai C. Gergen J.P. Development. 1995; 121: 453-462Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Younger-Shepherd S. Vaessin H. Bier E. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Cell. 1992; 70: 911-922Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Mammalian HES and runt-related genes are also co-expressed with TLE genes in a variety of cell types and their protein products participate in common developmental mechanisms (14Thirunavukkarasu K. Mahajan M. McLarren K.W. Stifani S. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4197-4208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Simeone A. Daga A. Calabi F. Dev.

Kageyama R. Tagawa Y. Shigemoto R. Nakanishi S. Genes Dev. 1992; 5: 2620-2634Crossref Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Together, these findings raise the possibility that Runt-related and HES proteins may interact. Here we describe experiments designed to test whether Cbfa1 can functionally interact with the HES family member, HES-1, which is co-expressed with Cbfa1 in mammalian skeletal cells (9Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A.L. Karsenty G. Cell. 1997; 89: 747-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3618) Google Scholar, 33Matsue M. Kageyama R. Denhardt D.T. Noda M. Bone. 1997; 20: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that Cbfa1 can physically interact with both HES-1 and TLE proteins and identify the domains of these molecules involved in these interactions. HES-1 also interacts with AML1, in addition to Cbfa1. Our studies also show that HES-1 can potentiate Cbfa1-mediated transactivation in transfected cells, possibly by virtue of its ability to antagonize the interaction of Cbfa1 with TLE proteins. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that the transcriptional functions of Cbfa1 are modulated by interactions with both TLE and HES family members. The following is a summary of the names and origins of the constructs used in these studies. Additional information on cloning strategies and oligonucleotide primers used in PCR experiments is available upon request. Vent DNA polymerase was used and PCR products were routinely sequenced before subcloning into the appropriate vectors. For expression of glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion proteins in bacteria, thepGEX1-TLE1(32–770) (near full-length TLE1 lacking the first 31 amino acids), pGEX2-TLE1(1–135) (Q domain of TLE1),pGEX3-TLE3(490–774) (WDR domain of TLE3), andpGEX1-HES-1(3–281) (the entire HES-1 sequence except for the first 2 amino acids) constructs were generated as described previously (35Grbavec D. Stifani S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 223: 701-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 36Grbavec D. Lo R. Liu Y. Stifani S. Eur. J.

The pGEX1-TLE1(290–461) plasmid was obtained by subcloning a PCR product encoding amino acids 290 through 461 (SP domain) of TLE1 into the BamHI andHindIII sites of pGEX-1. ThepGEX2-HES-1 ΔC (truncated HES-1 lacking the last 6 amino acids, WRPWRN) was generated by subcloning a PCR product encoding this portion of HES-1 into the SmaI site ofpGEX-2. The DNA construct for expression of GST-HES1 in mammalian cells, pEBG-HES-1(3–281), was obtained by subcloning a PvuII fragment from the rat HES-1cDNA into the filled-in ClaI site of the pEBGvector (38Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322-5323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1498) Google Scholar). Plasmids for in vitro translation reactions were obtained as follows. pcDNA3-GAL4bd-Cbfa1(241–523)and pcDNA3-GAL4bd-Cbfa1(241–442) (encoding the DNA-binding domain of GAL4 fused to either residues 241–523 or 241–442 of Cbfa1, respectively) were obtained by subcloningXhoI/XbaI fragments from the previously described (14Thirunavukkarasu K. Mahajan M. McLarren K.W. Stifani S. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4197-4208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) constructs pSG424-Cbfa1(241–523) and -Cbfa1(241–442) into the pcDNA3-GAL4bdvector (36Grbavec D. Lo R. Liu Y. Stifani S. Eur. J.

Plasmids pcDNA3-GAL4bd-AML1(2–453)(fusion protein of GAL4bd and AML1b) andpcDNA3-GAL4bd-AML1(2–472) (fusion protein of GAL4bd and AML1a) were generated by digesting pBluescript-AML1b or -a cDNAs (obtained from Y. Groner, The Weizmann Institute) with XhoI (followed by filling-in with Klenow DNA polymerase) and EcoRI, and by subcloning intopcDNA3-GAL4bd digested with EcoRV andEcoRI. DNA constructs for yeast two-hybrid assays were obtained as follows. pGAD424-Cbfa1(468–528) (activation domain of GAL4 fused to residues 468 through 528 of Cbfa1) was generated by subcloning a SmaI fragment frompBluescript-Cbfa1 into the SmaI site ofpGAD424. The plasmids pGBT9-TLE1(1–770), -TLE1(1–435), and -TLE1(444–770) (GAL4bd fused to full-length TLE1, the first 435 amino acids of TLE1, or residues 444 through 770 of TLE1, respectively) were obtained as described previously (36Grbavec D.

J. 1999; 337: 13-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). pGBT9-HES-1(193–281) (GAL4bd fused to amino acids 193 through 281 of HES-1) has been described previously (35Grbavec D. Stifani S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 223: 701-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Plasmids pCMV5-Cbfa1 (full-length Cbfa1),pCMV5-Cbfa1Δ49–96 (truncated form of Cbfa1 lacking the QA domain), and p6OSE2luc (luciferase reporter gene under the control of six Cbfa1-binding sites, the OSE2 element) have been described previously (9Ducy P.

Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4197-4208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pRc/CMV-HES-1construct (full-length HES-1) has been described (39Feder J.N. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). ThepCMV2-FLAG-AML1b plasmid was generated by digestingpcDNA3- GAL4bd-AML1(2–453) with EcoRI andXbaI, followed by filling-in with Klenow DNA polymerase and subcloning into the SmaI site of pCMV2-FLAG. ThepCMV2-FLAG-HES1(3–281) plasmid was obtained by subcloning aPvuII fragment from the rat HES-1 cDNA into the SmaI site of pCMV2-FLAG. ConstructpCMV2-FLAG-HES-1 ΔC was generated by subcloning a PCR product encoding this portion of HES-1 into the filled-inBamHI site of pCMV2-FLAG. ROS17/2.8 cells were grown as described previously (9Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A.L. Karsenty G.

Biol. 1998; 18: 4197-4208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and transfected using the SuperFect reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In each experiment, cells were co-transfected with 1.0 μg of either pCMV5-Cbfa1 DNA orpCMV2-FLAG-AML1b DNA and 1.0 μg of pEBG-HES-1DNA (or pEBG as control). Approximately 24 h after transfection, cells were collected, homogenized as described previously (40Husain J. Lo R. Grbavec D. Stifani S. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 523-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and incubated in the presence of glutathione-Sepharose beads for 60 min. The beads were then collected by centrifugation, washed five times with buffer 1 (25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.8, 200 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100), and immediately incubated in 2 × electrophoresis sample buffer, followed by SDS-PAGE and transfer to nitrocellulose. Nitrocellulose replicas were subjected to Western blotting analysis with previously described anti-Cbfa antibodies (9Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A.L. Karsenty G. Cell. 1997; 89: 747-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3618) Google Scholar, 13Ducy P.R. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell.

Proteins werein vitro translated and GST fusion proteins were expressed in bacteria and purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads as described previously (36Grbavec D. Lo R. Liu Y. Stifani S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 37Grbavec D. Lo R. Liu Y. Greenfield A. Stifani S. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 13-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise indicated, roughly 1 μg of each fusion protein was incubated at 4 °C with glutathione-Sepharose beads for 60 min. After this time, the appropriate in vitrotranslated proteins were mixed with the beads as described previously (36Grbavec D. Lo R. Liu Y. Stifani S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 37Grbavec D. Lo R. Liu Y. Greenfield A. Stifani S. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 13-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and incubations were prolonged for 3 h. Beads were then collected by centrifugation, washed five times with buffer 1, and incubated in 2× electrophoresis sample buffer, followed by SDS-PAGE, and autoradiography. Bacterial preparations of GST-HES-1 fusion proteins contained a number of lower M r species. Western blotting analysis showed that these components were recognized by anti-GST antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), indicating that they represented degradation products of the full-length GST-HES-1 fusion proteins and not unrelated bacterial proteins that co-isolate with GST-HES-1. Human 293 and rat ROS17/2.8 cells were cultured as described previously (9Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A.L. Karsenty G.

J. 1999; 337: 13-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and transfected using SuperFect. Cells were incubated in the presence of the Superfect-DNA complexes for 24 h. The amount of DNA transfected was adjusted using pcDNA3 plasmid so that the total amount of DNA used in each transfection was the same (3.0 μg). Transcription studies with the reporter plasmid p6OSE2luc (0.5 μg), plasmids pCMV5-Cbfa1 or pCMV5Cbfa1Δ49–96(0.5–1.0 μg), and constructs pCMV2-FLAG-HES-1(3–281) orpCMV2-FLAG-HES-1 ΔC (0.1–0.3 μg) were performed as described previously (9Ducy P.

In each case, 0.25 μg of pCMV-β-galactosidase plasmid DNA was co-transfected to provide a means of normalizing the assays for transfection efficiency. Results were expressed as mean value ± S.D. and were tested for statistical significance by the one-tailed Student's t test for paired differences. Yeast transformations and two-hybrid interaction assays were performed exactly as described previously (36Grbavec D. Lo R. Liu Y. Stifani S. Eur. J.

To address this question, we first performed coprecipitation assays using cells co-transfected with expression plasmids for HES-1 and Cbfa1. These factors are normally coexpressed in mammalian osteoblastic cells (9Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A.L. Karsenty G.

Rat ROS17/2.8 osteoblastic cells were transfected with either GST or a fusion protein of GST and HES-1 that contained the entire HES-1 sequence except for the first two amino acids (GST-HES-1(3–281)). Twenty-four hours later, cells were homogenized and the GST proteins were isolated on glutathione-Sepharose beads. Western blotting analysis of the fractions bound to the beads using anti-GST antibodies revealed that GST and GST-HES-1 were both stable and expressed at equivalent levels (Fig. 1 C, lanes 2 and4). Western blotting analysis with previously described (9Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A.L. Karsenty G.

Consistent with this result, the Cbfa1-related protein, AML1b, which represents the full-length form of AML1 (6Ito Y. J. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol. 1996; 84: 321-330Google Scholar, 16Speck N.A.

Together, these results show that HES-1 can associate with both Cbfa1 and AML1 in transfected cells.FIG. 2Interaction of AML1 and HES-1. A, transfection/coprecipitation assays. Rat ROS17/2.8 osteosarcoma cells were co-transfected with thepCMV2-FLAG-AML1b plasmid to express AML1b (lanes 1–4) and either the pEBG-HES-1(3–281) (lanes 1 and 2) or pEBG (lanes 3 and4) plasmids to express GST-HES-1 or GST, respectively. Cell homogenates were collected and incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads. The material that remained bound to the beads after extensive washing was subjected to SDS-PAGE (lanes 2 and 4) together with one-tenth of each input homogenate collected prior to incubation with glutathione-Sepharose beads (lanes 1 and3). An equivalent aliquot of homogenate from control non-transfected cells was loaded onto lane 5. After transfer to nitrocellulose, FLAG-AML1b (see arrow) was visualized by Western blotting with anti-FLAG antibodies.

These TnT FHC mutants were reconstituted into skinned cardiac muscle preparations and characterized for their effect on maximal steady state force activation, inhibition, and the Ca2+ sensitivity of force development. Troponin complexes containing these mutants were tested for their ability to regulate actin-tropomyosin(Tm)-activated myosin-ATPase activity. TnT(R278C) and TnT(F110I) reconstituted preparations demonstrated dramatically increased Ca2+sensitivity of force development, while those with TnT(R92Q) and TnT(I79N) showed a moderate increase. The deletion mutant, TnT(In16), significantly decreased both the activation and the inhibition of force, and substantially decreased the activation and the inhibition of actin-Tm-activated myosin-ATPase activity. ATPase activation was also impaired by TnT(F110I), while its inhibition was reduced by TnT(R278C). The TnT(E163K) mutation had the smallest effect on the Ca2+sensitivity of force; however, it produced an elevated activation of the ATPase activity in reconstituted thin filaments. These observed changes in the Ca2+ regulation of force development caused by these mutations would likely cause altered contractility and contribute to the development of FHC.

TnT(R278C) and TnT(F110I) reconstituted preparations demonstrated dramatically increased Ca2+sensitivity of force development, while those with TnT(R92Q) and TnT(I79N) showed a moderate increase. The deletion mutant, TnT(In16), significantly decreased both the activation and the inhibition of force, and substantially decreased the activation and the inhibition of actin-Tm-activated myosin-ATPase activity. ATPase activation was also impaired by TnT(F110I), while its inhibition was reduced by TnT(R278C). The TnT(E163K) mutation had the smallest effect on the Ca2+sensitivity of force; however, it produced an elevated activation of the ATPase activity in reconstituted thin filaments. These observed changes in the Ca2+ regulation of force development caused by these mutations would likely cause altered contractility and contribute to the development of FHC. troponin tropomyosin familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 3-[N-morpholino]propanesulfonic acid Vertebrate striated (skeletal and cardiac) muscle contraction is activated by the binding of Ca2+ to the low affinity Ca2+-specific (regulatory) sites of troponin (Tn)1 C, the Ca2+-binding subunit of Tn, which together with TnI, TnT, and tropomyosin (Tm) form the regulatory system of the contractile apparatus (1Zot A.S.

Studies of the regulation of skeletal and cardiac muscle contraction have suggested that TnT not only anchors the TnI·TnC complex to the thin filaments through its interaction with TnI and Tm, but also confers the Ca2+ sensitivity to the actomyosin-ATPase activity and/or force (5Greaser M.L.

Whereas individuals with myosin heavy chain mutations, in general, have a higher level of cardiac hypertrophy, those with HCTnT mutations have less hypertrophy, but a higher incidence of sudden cardiac death at a young age (13Watkins H.

At present, 11 amino acid mutations in HCTnT have been identified to be associated with FHC: I79N, R92Q/W/L, A104V, F110I, ΔE160, E163K, E244D, R278C, and an In16 mutation. The latter arises from abnormal splicing of intron 16 (G1 → A) which deletes exon 16 and reads exon 17 in the wrong frame (12Thierfelder L. Watkins H. MacRae C. Lamas R. McKenna W. Vosberg H.P.

The resulting mRNA encodes a protein that lacks the COOH-terminal 28 amino acids (exon 16 and 17) and has an additional 7 residues. There is not a clear understanding of why these mutations in HCTnT lead to the development of FHC or sudden cardiac death. In this study we have focused on the following FHC HCTnT mutations: TnT(I79N), TnT(R92Q), TnT(F110I), TnT(E163K), TnT(R278C), and TnT(In16). Several reports have appeared, which have examined the effects of these mutations on the biochemical and contractile properties of cardiac muscle (13Watkins H. McKenna W.J. Thierfelder L. Suk H.J.

Four of the HCTnT mutants (I79N, R92Q, F110I, and R278C) studied in this paper have been reported in a recent paper from Yanaga et al. (34Yanaga F. Morimoto S. Ohtsuki I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8806-8812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), who investigated their effect on myofibrillar ATPase activity in reconstituted myofibrils.

We have reconstituted the HCTnT mutants into actomyosin, and skinned cardiac (porcine) muscle fiber preparations and studied their effects on inhibition, activation, and the Ca2+ sensitivity of ATPase and steady state force development. Our results are discussed in relation to those from the Ohtsuki lab (32Morimoto S. Yanaga F. Minakami R. Ohtsuki I. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C200-C207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Yanaga F.

We found that TnT(R278C)-, TnT(F110I)-, TnT(I79N)-, and TnT(R92Q)-reconstituted skinned cardiac muscle preparations had significantly increased Ca2+ sensitivity of force development, whereas those reconstituted with TnT(In16) had dramatically decreased maximal force and force inhibition. We also found that troponin complexes made from TnT(F110I) and TnT(In16) had substantially reduced activation of actin-Tm-activated myosin-ATPase activity while those containing TnT(R278C) and TnT(In16) demonstrated impaired inhibition of the ATPase. The cDNAs encoding human cardiac TnT, TnI, and TnC were cloned by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction using a template of total RNA from human myocardium and oligonucleotide primers specific for the 5′ and 3′ regions of the respective coding sequences. Additionally, the six TnT FHC mutants: I79N, R92Q, F110I, E163K, R278C, and In16, a mutation in HCTnT, which arises from abnormal splicing of Intron 16(G1 → A), were made using a sequential overlapping polymerase chain reaction-based method (36Ausubel F.M.

Standard methods were utilized for expression and purification of wild-type HCTnT and its FHC mutants as well as HCTnI and HCTnC (37Pan B.S. Potter J.D. J. Biol.

All clones were sequenced to verify the correct sequences prior to expression and purification of the respective proteins. Rabbit skeletal F-actin was prepared as described by Strzelecka et al. (40Strzelecka Golaszewska H. Jakubiak M. Drabikowski W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 55: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Porcine cardiac myosin was purified according to Murakami et al. (41Murakami U. Uchida K. Hiratsuka T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1976; 80: 611-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Porcine cardiac Tm, TnC, and TnI were prepared from pig ventricles according to Potter (42Potter J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 241-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The complexes of wild-type HCTnT and its FHC mutants with porcine cardiac TnI and TnC were prepared according to the following protocol (42Potter J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 241-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). All Tn subunits (T, I, and C) were first dialyzed against 6 m urea, 10 mmMOPS, pH 7.0, 0.25 mm CaCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.01% NaN3. After dialysis they were mixed at a molar ratio 1.25:1.25:1 (T:I:C) and incubated for 1 h on ice before being dialyzed against buffers with decreasing concentrations of urea. The dialysis buffer contained 1 mKCl, 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01 NaN3 and initially 6, then 3, followed by 0m urea. Subsequently, the complexes were gradually dialyzed against buffers containing decreasing concentrations of KCl, starting from 1, then 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, and finally 0.1 m KCl. Excess of TnT and TnI that precipitated at the low ionic strength + 0m urea buffer was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 rpm for 30 min. The molar ratio of the reconstituted troponin complexes was verified by SDS 15%-PAGE (43Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar) and was 1:1:1 for TnT:TnI:TnC. The ATPase assays were performed with rabbit skeletal muscle F-actin (3.5 μm) containing porcine cardiac Tm (1 μm) and formed Tn complexes (1 μm). The concentration of porcine cardiac myosin was 0.6 μm. All ATPase assays were performed in the presence (0.5 mmCaCl2) or absence (1 mm EGTA) of Ca2+. The ATPase reactions (in 10 mm MOPS, 50 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, pH 7.0) were initiated with 2.5 mm ATP and after 20 min incubation, they were terminated with 5% trichloroacetic acid. Released inorganic phosphate was measured according to Fiske and SubbaRow (44Fiske C.H. SubbaRow Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1925; 66: 375-400Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Porcine muscle fiber bundles were mounted on a force transducer and treated with the pCa 8 relaxing solution containing 1% Triton X-100 for ∼1 h. The composition of the pCa 8 solution was 10−8m Ca2+, 1 mm Mg2+, 7 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgATP2+, 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 20 mm creatinine phosphate, and 15 units/ml creatinine phosphokinase, I = 150 mm. Subsequently, the fibers were transferred into the pCa 8 solution without Triton X-100 and then to the pCa 4 solution for the initial force determination. The composition of the pCa 4 solution was the same as that of the pCa 8 buffer, except the Ca2+ concentration was 10−4m. To determine the Ca2+ sensitivity of force development, the fibers were gradually exposed to the solutions of increasing Ca2+ concentrations, from pCa 8 topCa 4. To displace the endogenous Tn complex from the fibers they were incubated in a solution containing 250 mm KCl, 20 mm MOPS, pH 6.2, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and ≈0.8–1 mg/ml HCWTnT or its FHC mutants, for 1 h at room temperature. A fresh TnT protein was applied to the fibers for another 1-h incubation. This was to increase the efficiency of the endogenous Tn displacement from the fibers. Displaced fibers were then washed with the same solution without the protein (10 min at room temperature) and tested for Ca2+-unregulated force that developed due to the absence of the endogenous porcine cardiac TnI and TnC. The Ca2+ regulation of steady-state force was restored with a preformed HCTnI·HCTnC complex. The reconstitution with the HCTnI·HCTnC complex (30 μm) was performed in thepCa 8 solution for ∼1.5 h at room temperature, or long enough for the force to reach a stable level. Control fibers were run in parallel and treated with the same solutions minus the proteins. The final Ca2+ sensitivity of force development was determined after HCTnI·HCTnC reconstitution and the data were analyzed with the Hill equation: % relative force = 100 × [Ca2+]nH/([Ca2+]nH+ pCa50nH), where pCa50 determines the pCa of a solution in which 50% of a change is produced and n H is the Hill coefficient. In this study we have characterized the following TnT mutations associated with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: I79N, R92Q, F110I, E163K, R278C, and In16 mutation, which arises from abnormal splicing of intron 16 and results in a truncated TnT protein. These TnT mutants together with other Tn subunits (TnC and TnI) were reconstituted in actin-Tm containing thin filaments and tested for the Ca2+ regulation of the actomyosin-ATPase activity. These mutants were also reconstituted in skinned cardiac muscle preparations and investigated for their ability to regulate force development, relaxation, and the Ca2+ sensitivity of force development. Fig. 1 illustrates the amino acid sequence of the adult isoform (HCTnT3) of human cardiac TnT. The cDNA encoding HCTnT isoform lacks a cassette of 30 base pairs located in the 5′ end of the molecule (45Anderson P.A. Greig A. Mark T.M. Malouf N.N. Oakeley A.E. Ungerleider R.M. Allen P.D.

The Ca2+ regulation of the ATPase activity was determined for wild-type HCTnT and its FHC mutants, when complexed with porcine cardiac TnI and TnC. Fig. 3 A shows the activation (+Ca2+) and Fig. 3 B the inhibition (−Ca2+) of the ATPase activity expressed as a percentage of the ATPase determined in the absence of troponin (basal activity). As shown in Fig. 3 A, the mutants TnT(E163K) and TnT(R278C) demonstrated elevated ATPase activity compared with the HCWTnT (p < 0.05). Their ATPase activities were ≈190 ± 9 and 182 ± 6%, respectively, while that of HCWTnT was ≈172 ± 9%. On the other hand, TnT(F110I) and TnT(In16) showed decreased ATPase activation, ≈152 ± 5 and 150 ± 8%, respectively (p < 0.05), while TnT(I79N) activated the ATPase in a similar manner (≈177 ± 5%) to HCWTnT. Alternatively, the inhibition (−Ca2+) of the ATPase activity was impaired with TnT(In16) (≈55 ± 1%) and TnT(R278C) (≈55 ± 8%) compared with ≈86 ± 6% of inhibition assessed with HCWTnT (Fig. 3 B). The mutants, TnT(I79N), TnT(F110I), and TnT(E163K), inhibited the actin-Tm-activated myosin-ATPase activity in a similar manner (≈72 ± 4, 73 ± 8, and 76 ± 6%, respectively) to HCWTnT.Asterisks in Fig. 3 (A and B) indicate the statistical significance of the activation/inhibition of the ATPase activity by the troponin containing wild-type HCTnT and respective FHC TnT mutants, p < 0.05. The physiological significance of the FHC TnT mutations was examined utilizing porcine skinned fibers, in which steady-state force activation, inhibition, and the Ca2+ sensitivity of force development were measured. The skinned cardiac muscle preparations were incubated with HCWTnT and its FHC mutants until a complete loss of the Ca2+ dependence of force was observed. Fig. 4 illustrates an experimental protocol for TnT(E163K)-treated preparations. The same protocol was applied for HCWTnT and the other FHC TnT mutants. As shown in Fig. 4, incubation of the fibers with TnT(E163K) for 2 h at room temperature resulted in a complete loss of the Ca2+dependence of force following displacement of the Tn complex with TnT(E163K). The fibers became insensitive to Ca2+ and could not relax due to the absence of the TnI·TnC complex. The level of Ca2+-unregulated force following the TnT treatment did not depend on the FHC TnT mutant utilized in the displacement procedure and was equal ≈60% of the force developed by the untreated skinned fiber preparations. Since the average rundown of the control fibers treated with the buffers minus proteins for the same amount of time as the experimental fiber was ≈12–18%, the true level of Ca2+-unregulated force was ≈67–71%. For clarity this level was set to 100% for each TnT mutant to determine the percentage of force activation and inhibition following the treatment. For two of the FHC TnT mutants, In16 and F110I, a residual Ca2+sensitivity of force was observed following the TnT(F110) and TnT(In16) treatment. The other FHC TnT mutants, I79N, R92Q, E163K, R278C, and wild-type HCTnT were able to replace the entire Tn complex within the time of incubation as judged by the complete loss of the Ca2+ dependence of force. When Tn-displaced fibers were incubated with a preformed human cardiac TnI·TnC complex, dissolved in the relaxing solution (pCa 8), they underwent a gradual relaxation which was monitored by the inhibition of force in the absence of Ca2+ (pCa 8). Incubation of the Tn-displaced fibers with the HCTnI·HCTnC complex restored the entire Tn complex, and the Ca2+ regulation of force. Fig. 5 demonstrates the SDS-15% PAGE of representative Tn-displaced cardiac muscle preparations utilizing either the HCWTnT or the TnT(R278C) mutant. As shown, the TnT-treated fibers had a greatly reduced endogenous TnI·TnC content (lanes 2 and 7) which was completely reconstituted with a preformed HCTnI·HCTnC complex (lanes 3 and 8). The stoichiometric ratio of other muscle proteins in the fibers: F-actin, tropomyosin, myosin light chains 1 (ELC), and 2 (RLC), was not changed following the TnT treatment/reconstitution. A Western blot of the TnT(R278C)-treated and HCTnI·HCTnC-reconstituted fibers performed with the TnT (A) and TnI (B) specific antibodies (Goat anti-HCTnT polyclonal and monoclonal mouse anti-TnI IE7 GAM-PO) is presented in Fig. 6. As shown, the TnT(R278C)-treated fibers lacked the endogenous TnI that was displaced (lane 1) during the treatment and was easily reconstituted with human cardiac TnI during incubation of the TnT(R278C)-treated fibers with the recombinant HCTnI·HCTnC complex (lane 2).FIG. 5SDS-15% PAGE of HCWTnT- or TnT(R278C)-treated and HCTnI·HCTnC-reconstituted porcine skinned cardiac muscle fibers.

The dashed line indicates the level of Ca2+-unregulated force following the TnT treatment (set to 100% for each TnT mutant). Theopen bars represent the force developed in the presence of Ca2+, while the dashed bars indicate the level of force in the absence of Ca2+ (Fig. 7). As shown, the level of force inhibition (pCa 8) and force activation (pCa 4) following the TnT treatment and HCTnI·HCTnC reconstitution depended on the FHC TnT mutant used in the Tn-displacement procedure. The fibers treated with HCWTnT and reconstituted with HCTnI·HCTnC inhibited (−Ca2+) ≈95.5 ± 7.8% of the Ca2+-unregulated force (100%) and after being switched to the high Ca2+ solution (pCa 4) developed ≈90.6 ± 6.7% of the force. The FHC TnT mutants, I79N and E163K, inhibited and activated force in a similar manner to HCWTnT (Fig. 7). Slightly impaired inhibition of force (in the absence of Ca2+) was demonstrated for R92Q, F110I, and R278C, whereas In16 only inhibited ≈74.7 ± 8.0% of the force. Activation of force (in the presence of Ca2+) was also very impaired for In16 (35 ± 3%), while R278C and F110I-treated fibers developed ≈79 ± 10.4 and 80 ± 12.3% of force, respectively (Fig. 7). Skinned porcine muscle fibers reconstituted with human cardiac Tn were tested for their Ca2+ sensitivity of force development (Fig. 8). As shown in Fig. 8 A, porcine fibers reconstituted with human cardiac Tn (T, I, and C) were less sensitive to Ca2+ (ΔpCa50 ≈ −0.19) than intact untreated fibers. However, when the porcine fibers were reconstituted with porcine Tn (T, I, and C), the same sensitivity of force development, before and after the treatment, was observed (data not shown). Thus, the −0.19 difference in the Ca2+sensitivity between the porci"

Here we studied a mechanism of cell-cell adhesion of the nectin-afadin system by use of a cadherin-deficient L cell line stably expressing the intact form of mouse nectin-2α, a truncated form of nectin-2α incapable of interacting with afadin (nectin-2α-ΔC), or a point-mutated form of nectin-2α capable of interacting with afadin and a cadherin-expressing EL cell line, which transiently expressed the point-mutated form of nectin-2α. We found that the interaction of nectin-2α with afadin was necessary for their clustering at cell-cell contact sites. However, nectin-2α-ΔC showed cisdimerization and trans interaction, both of which did not require the interaction of nectin-2α with afadin. We have previously shown in EL cells that the interaction of nectin-1 with afadin is necessary for its recruitment to adherens junctions. We found that thetrans interaction of nectin-2α was furthermore necessary for this recruitment. On the basis of these observations, we propose a model for the mechanism of cell-cell adhesion of nectin and roles of afadin in this mechanism.

Nectin-2 has two splicing variants, nectin-2α and -2δ. Each member of the nectin family consists of extracellular three Ig-like domains, a single transmembrane region, and a single cytoplasmic region. The cytoplasmic region has a C-terminal conserved motif of four amino acid residues, which interacts with the PDZ domain of afadin, an actin filament-binding protein, and is linked to the actin cytoskeleton through afadin (1Mandai K.

The distal portion of the cytoplasmic region interacts with catenins, including α-, β-, and γ-catenins, which connect cadherin to the actin cytoskeleton. The juxtamembrane portion interacts with p120 ctn (19Yap A.S. Niessen C.M. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 779-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 20Ozawa M. Kemler R. J.

The distal portion positively regulates thetrans interaction through the interaction with catenins, although it is not clear whether this portion directly regulates thecis dimerization. In contrast to cadherin, however, the mechanism by which nectin expresses its adhesion activity has not yet been studied. In this study, we have attempted to examine the mechanism of cell-cell adhesion of nectin and roles of afadin in this mechanism by use of cadherin-deficient mouse L cells and cadherin cDNA-introduced L cells (EL cells), which express intact and mutated forms of mouse nectin-2α.

Gene (Amst.). 1983; 25: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar), respectively. Various constructs of mouse nectin-2α contained the following amino acids: pCAGGSneo-nectin-2α, 1–467 (full-length); pCAGIPuro-nectin-2α-ΔC, 1–463 (deletion of the C-terminal 4 amino acid residues); pPGKIH-nectin-2α, 1–467 (full-length); pPGKIH-nectin-2α-ΔC, 1–463 (deletion of the C-terminal 4 amino acid residues); and pFLAG-CMV1-nectin-2α, 28–467. A point-mutated form of mouse nectin-2α (pm-nectin-2α) contained the following sequence: substitution of TTT at codon 136 with CTT (Phe to Leu; see Fig. 5 A). Constructs of pm-nectin-2α contained the following amino acids: pCAGIPuro-pm-nectin-2α, 1–467 (full-length); and pFLAG-CMV1-pm-nectin-2α, 28–467. The pFLAG-CMV1 vectors were constructed to express the N-terminal FLAG-tagged proteins. L and EL cells were kindly supplied by Drs. Sh. Tsukita and A. Nagafuchi (Kyoto University). These cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. L cell lines stably expressing full-length nectin-2α (nectin-2α-L cells), nectin-2α-ΔC (nectin-2α-ΔC-L cells), or pm-nectin-2α (pm-nectin-2α-L cells) were prepared as described (2Takahashi K.

Briefly, L cells were transfected with the pCAGGSneo, pCAGIPuro, or pPGKIH construct using LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies). The cells were then cultured for 1 day, replated, and selected by culturing in the presence of 500 μg/ml geneticin (Life Technologies), 10 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma), or 500 μg/ml hygromycin (Life Technologies), respectively. EL cells transiently expressing FLAG-tagged nectin-2α or pm-nectin-2α were prepared using the pFLAG-CMV1 construct as described (2Takahashi K. Nakanishi H. Miyahara M. Mandai K. Satoh K. Satoh A.

Briefly, to obtain a single-cell suspension, cells were washed with PBS, incubated with 0.2% trypsin and 1 mm EDTA at 37 °C for 5 min, and dispersed by gentle pipetting. Cells were then suspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution (1 × 106 cells/ml), placed in 12-well plates precoated with bovine serum albumin, and rotated on a gyratory shaker at 37 °C for the indicated periods. Aggregation was stopped with the addition of 2% glutaraldehyde. The extent of aggregation of cells was represented by the ratio of the total particle number at time t of incubation (Nt) to the initial particle number (No). For mixed-cell aggregation assay, nectin-2α-L cells were prelabeled with DiI(Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) as described (38Honig M.G. Hume R.I. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 171-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). The labeled nectin-2α-L cells were mixed with an equal number of pm-nectin-2α-L cells or nectin-2α-ΔC-L cells to give a final concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml and rotated at 37 °C for 30 min. After the addition of 2% glutaraldehyde, aggregates were subjected to phase and fluorescence microscopy, and the cell composition (labeled or unlabeled cells) of four-cell aggregates was determined as described (39Sieber F. Roseman S. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 90: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation was performed as described (2Takahashi K. Nakanishi H. Miyahara M. Mandai K. Satoh K. Satoh A. Nishioka H. Aoki J. Nomoto A. Mizoguchi A. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 539-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were sonicated in buffer A (20 mm Tris/Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A), followed by ultracentrifugation. The supernatant was incubated with the monoclonal anti-nectin-2 Ab at 4 °C for 3 h. Protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were then added to this sample, and incubation was further performed at 4 °C for 1 h. After the beads were extensively washed with buffer A, the bound proteins were eluted by boiling the beads in the SDS sample buffer (60 mmTris/Cl, pH 6.7, 3% SDS, 2% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, and 5% glycerol) and subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blot analysis. Chemical cross-linking was done as described (7Lopez M. Aoubala M. Jordier F. Isnardon D. Gomez S. Dubreuil P. Blood. 1998; 92: 4602-4611Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, a single-cell suspension (1 × 106 cells/ml) obtained as described above was incubated in PBS with 1 mmbis-(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate cross-linker (Pierce). After incubation at 14 °C for 15 min, the reaction was stopped with the addition of 10 mm Tris/Cl, pH 7.5. Cells were washed with PBS and counted to confirm that there was no aggregation in the cell suspension. Immunofluorescence microscopy of cultured cells was done as described (1Mandai K. Nakanishi H. Satoh A. Obaishi H. Wada M. Nishioka H. Itoh M. Mizoguchi A. Aoki T. Fujimoto T. Matsuda Y. Tsukita S. Takai Y. J.

Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 539-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined with bovine serum albumin as a reference protein (40Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was done as described (41Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the C-terminal 4 amino acid residues of each nectin family member are responsible for its interaction with afadin (2Takahashi K. Nakanishi H. Miyahara M. Mandai K. Satoh K. Satoh A. Nishioka H. Aoki J. Nomoto A. Mizoguchi A. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 539-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). We attempted to examine whether this interaction is essential for cell-cell adhesion activity. For this purpose, cadherin-deficient L cells were used, because these cells do not show cell aggregation activity under the conditions used here. We then prepared the following L cell lines: L cells stably expressing various levels of nectin-2α (nectin-2α-L cells; clones 1–3) and L cells stably expressing various levels of the C-terminal 4 amino acid residue-deleted mutant of nectin-2α (nectin-2α-ΔC-L cells; clones 1–3). The expression levels of nectin-2α-ΔC protein in nectin-2α-ΔC-L cell clones 1–3 were similar to those of nectin-2α protein in nectin-2α-L cell clones 1–3, respectively (Fig. 1, A1and A2). By use of these cell lines, we examined cell aggregation activity. Nectin-2α and nectin-2α-ΔC showed similar cell aggregation activity (Fig. 1, B andC1–C3). To confirm whether afadin interacts with nectin-2α but not with nectin-2α-ΔC in intact cells, nectin-2α-L cells (clone 3) and nectin-2α-ΔC-L cells (clone 3) were subjected to immunoprecipitation using the monoclonal anti-nectin-2 Ab. Afadin was coimmunoprecipitated with nectin-2α but not with nectin-2α-ΔC (Fig. 2). These results indicate that the interaction of nectin-2α with afadin is not essential for itstrans interaction. It has previously been shown that nectin-2α forms a cis dimer (7Lopez M. Aoubala M. Jordier F. Isnardon D. Gomez S. Dubreuil P. Blood. 1998; 92: 4602-4611Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To first confirm this result and to then examine whether nectin-2α-ΔC also forms acis dimer, nectin-2α-L cells (clone 3) and nectin-2α-ΔC-L cells (clone 3) were dissociated to single-cell suspensions and incubated with a cell surface cross-linker, bis-(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate, followed by Western blot analysis using the polyclonal anti-nectin-2α Ab. The cross-linking of each cell line resulted in the formation of an additional band with a molecular mass of ∼140 kDa that corresponded to the dimeric form (Fig. 3). The extent of dimerization of nectin-2α-ΔC was similar to that of nectin-2α. Because the cross-linking was done in single-cell suspensions, it is most likely that this dimer is derived from the cis interaction rather than the trans interaction. These results indicate that the interaction of nectin-2α with afadin is not essential for itscis dimerization. To asses a role of afadin in cell-cell adhesion of nectin-2α, we next performed immunofluorescence microscopy of nectin-2α-L cells (clone 1) and nectin-2α-ΔC-L cells (clone 1). Both nectin-2α and nectin-2α-ΔC were localized at cell-cell contact sites, but nectin-2α showed the denser and sharper localization than nectin-2α-ΔC (Fig. 4, A1and B1). In nectin-2α-L cells (clone 1), afadin was concentrated and colocalized with nectin-2α at cell-cell contact sites (Fig. 4 A2). In nectin-2α-ΔC-L cells (clone 1), however, afadin was not concentrated at cell-cell contact sites where nectin-2α-ΔC was localized (Fig. 4 B2). These staining patterns of afadin were consistent with the above results obtained by the immunoprecipitation experiments. These results indicate that the interaction of nectin-2α with afadin is necessary for their clustering at cell-cell contact sites. During the vector construction for nectin-2α, we incidentally obtained a point-mutated form of nectin-2α (pm-nectin-2α). In this mutant, TTT (Phe) was replaced with CTT (Leu) at codon 136, which was located in the first Ig-like domain (Fig. 5 A). Computer analysis of secondary structure prediction indicated that this point mutation does not change the secondary structure of the first Ig-like domain (data not shown). We prepared an L cell line stably expressing pm-nectin-2α (pm-nectin-2α-L cells) and examined its properties. The expression level of pm-nectin-2α protein in this cell line was similar to that of nectin-2α protein in nectin-2α-L cells (clone 3; Fig. 5 B), but pm-nectin-2α-L cells did not show cell aggregation activity under the conditions in which nectin-2α-L cells (clone 3) showed this activity (Fig. 5 C). To confirm this result, mixed-cell aggregation assays between pm-nectin-2α-L cells and DiI-prelabeled nectin-2α-L cells (clone 3) were performed. Aggregates exclusively consisted of DiI-prelabeled nectin-2α-L cells (Fig. 6,A1–A3). In contrast, when nectin-2α-ΔC-L cells (clone 3) were mixed with DiI-prelabeled nectin-2α-L cells (clone 3), aggregates consisted evenly of both labeled and unlabeled cells (Fig. 6, B1–B3). These results indicate that pm-nectin-2α loses the trans interaction activity. Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that afadin was coimmunoprecipitated with pm-nectin-2α, indicating that pm-nectin-2α interacts with afadin in intact cells (Fig. 7). Cell surface cross-linking of pm-nectin-2α-L cells revealed that pm-nectin-2α formed acis dimer (Fig. 8). To examine the localization of pm-nectin-2α, pm-nectin-2α-L cells were subjected to immunofluorescence microscopy. pm-nectin-2α was diffusely distributed throughout the cell surface and hardly concentrated at cell-cell contact sites (Fig. 9 A; see Fig. 4 A1). Afadin showed the similar staining pattern (Fig. 9 B; see Fig. 4 A2). These results indicate that the transinteraction (cell-cell adhesion activity) of nectin-2α is essential for its clustering at cell-cell contact sites.FIG. 8cis Dimerization of pm-nectin-2α. A single-cell suspension of pm-nectin-2α-L cells was incubated in the presence or absence of bis-(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate. Each cell lysate (10 μg of protein each) was subjected to SDS-PAGE (10% polyacrylamide gel), followed by Western blot analysis using the polyclonal anti-nectin-2α Ab.Arrow, monomeric form; arrowhead, dimeric form.

The results shown are representative of three independent experiments. Scale bars, 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In the last set of experiments, we examined the localization of pm-nectin-2α in EL cells, which are cloned by introduction of the exogenous E-cadherin cDNA to L cells (42Nagafuchi A. Shirayoshi Y. Okazaki K. Yasuda K. Takeichi M. Nature. 1987; 329: 341-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). For this purpose, we prepared EL cells transiently expressing FLAG-tagged pm-nectin-2α. In these cells, the FLAG-tagged protein was not recruited to cell-cell AJs where E-cadherin and afadin were localized (Fig. 10, A1, A2, B1, and B2). The colocalization of afadin with E-cadherin at cell-cell AJs might be attributable to the presence of endogenous nectin-1 and -2. In contrast, in EL cells transiently expressing FLAG-tagged nectin-2α, the FLAG-tagged protein was colocalized with E-cadherin and afadin at cell-cell AJs (data not shown). Taken together with our previous observation that nectin-1 is recruited to cadherin-based AJs through the interaction with afadin (2Takahashi K. Nakanishi H. Miyahara M. Mandai K. Satoh K. Satoh A. Nishioka H. Aoki J. Nomoto A. Mizoguchi A. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 539-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar), these results indicate that the recruitment of nectin to cadherin-based AJs requires not only its interaction with afadin but also its trans interaction (cell-cell adhesion activity). Nectin belongs to the Ig superfamily and constitutes a family consisting of at least three members, nectin-1, -2α, and -2δ (2Takahashi K. Nakanishi H. Miyahara M. Mandai K. Satoh K. Satoh A.

The Ig superfamily encompasses diverse molecules that share a common structural homology (43Edelman G.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1986; 2: 81-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 44Williams A.F. Barclay A.N. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1988; 6: 381-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (1791) Google Scholar, 45Buck C.A. Semin. Cell Biol. 1992; 3: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This superfamily includes CAMs and receptors for cytokines and growth factors. Of the Ig superfamily, some members, such as CD4 and ICAM, form cis dimers and interact with their ligands (46Wu H. Kwong P.D. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1997; 387: 527-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 47Casasnovas J.M. Stehle T. Liu J.H. Wang J.H. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4134-4139Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Others, such as the platelet-derived growth factor receptor, interact with their ligands, resulting in theircis dimerization. We have shown here that nectin-2α forms a cis dimer in a single-cell suspension. Furthermore, pm-nectin-2α forms a cis dimer but does not showtrans interaction (cell-cell adhesion activity). It is unlikely that the trans interaction of nectin induces itscis dimerization. It has been shown that the cisdimerization of cadherin is essential for its transinteraction (23Tamura K. Shan W.-S. Hendrickson W.A. Colman D.R. Shapiro L. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1153-1163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 24Tomschy A. Fauser C. Landwehr R. Engel J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3507-3514Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). By analogy with cadherin, the cisdimerization of nectin may be a key regulatory step for itstrans interaction. It has been shown that cell-cell adhesion activity of nectin-2 is inhibited by anti-nectin-2 Abs, which recognize the first and third Ig-like domains (6Aoki J. Koike S. Asou H. Ise I. Suwa H. Tanaka T. Miyasaka M. Nomoto A. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 235: 374-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). It has been proposed from this result that the first and third Ig-like domains interact with each other on opposing cell surfaces in an antiparallel orientation. However, the first and third Ig-like domains of nectin may be responsible for itstrans interaction (cell-cell adhesion activity) andcis dimerization, respectively, because we have shown here that the point mutation in the first Ig-like domain of nectin-2α (pm-nectin-2α) completely abolishes its trans interaction but not its cis dimerization. The first Ig-like domain is classified to the V set according to secondary structure prediction (5Eberlé F. Dubreuil P. Mattei M.-G. Devilard E. Lopez M. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 159: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Computer analysis of secondary structure prediction indicates that the point mutation (Phe to Leu) at the 136th amino acid residue of nectin-2α retains the secondary structure of the V set. Moreover, this Phe residue is conserved in the first Ig-like domain of nectin-1 as well as of nectin-2δ. It is likely that at least the Phe residue of the first Ig-like domain of each nectin member plays a key role in its trans interaction. The cytoplasmic region of cadherin has at least two regulatory domains for the cis dimerization and/or transinteraction: a stimulatory domain at the distal portion, which interacts with catenins; and an inhibitory domain at the juxtamembrane portion, which interacts with p120 ctn (19Yap A.S.

Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Deletion of the distal portion abolishes at least the transinteraction of cadherin (25Nagafuchi A. Takeichi M. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3679-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar, 26Nagafuchi A. Takeichi M. Cell Regul. 1989; 1: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 27Ozawa M. Ringwald M. Kemler R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4246-4250Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Further deletion of the juxtamembrane portion restores the cis dimerization and transinteraction, indicating that the linkage of cadherin to the actin cytoskeleton through catenins is not essential for the cisdimerization or the trans interaction (20Ozawa M. Kemler R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1605-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The properties of nectin-2α-ΔC shown here are apparently similar to those of cadherin lacking both the juxtamembrane and distal regions. The linkage of various CAMs to the actin cytoskeleton may not be required for thecis dimerization or the trans interaction. On the basis of our previous (2Takahashi K. Nakanishi H. Miyahara M. Mandai K. Satoh K. Satoh A. Nishioka H. Aoki J. Nomoto A. Mizoguchi A. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 539-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar) and present observations, we propose a model for the mechanism of cell-cell adhesion of nectin and roles of afadin in this mechanism (Fig. 11). Nectin first forms a cis dimer presumably through the third Ig-like domain, followed by its trans interaction presumably through the first Ig-like domain. Then, the interaction of nectin with afadin induces its clustering and recruitment to cadherin-based AJs. The trans interaction is likely to be an earlier step than the clustering and recruitment, because pm-nectin-2α does not show the clustering or colocalization with E-cadherin. On the other hand, the functional relationship between cadherin and nectin remains to be clarified. It also remains to be clarified how the interaction with afadin recruits nectin to cadherin-based AJs. We have recently identified an afadin-binding protein, named ponsin, which interacts with vinculin (48Mandai K. Nakanishi H. Satoh A. Takahashi K. Satoh K. Nishioka H. Mizoguchi A. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1001-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Because vinculin binds to α-catenin (49Weiss E.E. Kroemker M. Rüdiger A.-H. Jockusch B.M. Rüdiger M J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 755-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), it is possible that the nectin-afadin system is associated with the cadherin-catenin system at least through the ponsin-vinculin system. Further analysis of the nectin-afadin system will lead us to a better understanding of cell-cell adhesion at cadherin-based AJs. We are grateful to Dr. M.

It serves a structural role in arthropods, including crustaceans and insects, as well as mollusks, nematodes, and worms. It is also found in fungi, making up from less than 1% to more than 40% of the cell wall, depending on the organism. Chitin has not been found, however, in mammals. Nevertheless, several mammalian proteins with homology to fungal, bacterial, or plant chitinases have been identified (1Rejman J.J. Hurley W.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The physiological purpose for a mammalian chitinase remains unproven. Because chitin is an integral component of fungal cell walls, a defensive function has been suggested for the enzyme (9Overdijk B. Van Steijn G.J.

The authors speculate that the enzyme, along with other macrophage gene products, may modulate the extracellular matrix in the vessel wall and thus affect the downstream tissue remodeling events associated with atherogenesis.

As part of an effort to analyze gene expression patterns in macrophages, we determined the nucleotide sequences of nearly 3500 random cDNAs from monocyte-derived macrophages (16Chantry D. DeMaggio A.J. Brammer H. Raport C.J. Wood C.L. Schweickart V.L. Epp A. Smith A. Stine J.T. Walton K. Tjoelker L. Godiska R. Gray P.W. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 64: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the chitinase cDNA was the sixth most common transcript found, appearing at a frequency of 0.5%. The only transcripts appearing more frequently were those of the ferritin heavy and light chains, collagenase, β-actin, and annexin II, all serving either housekeeping or tissue remodeling and repair functions. Comparison of the predicted protein sequence of the chitinase open reading frame with chitinases from other species revealed that the protein is likely composed of two distinct domains. The putative catalytic domain, predicted on the basis of its extensive homology with the catalytic domains of the other chitinases (11Boot R.G. Renkema G.H. Strijland A. van Zonneveld A.J. Aerts J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26252-26256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), is contained within the N-terminal 75% of the protein. The remaining one-quarter of the protein has limited homology with the chitin-binding domains of the Manduca sexta and Brugia malayichitinases (11Boot R.G. Renkema G.H. Strijland A. van Zonneveld A.J. Aerts J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26252-26256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Consistent with the possibility that this C terminus is a chitin-binding domain, Renkema et al. (17Renkema G.H. Boot R.G. Strijland A. Donker-Koopman W.E. van den Berg M. Muijsers A.O. Aerts J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) describe a C-terminally truncated form of the human chitinase that can hydrolyze chitotriose but is unable to bind chitin. The possibility of distinct autonomous domains in human chitinase provides an opportunity to dissect out the functional constraints that define the enzyme. In this report, we focus on the chitin-binding domain, describing structural features required for activity and the interaction of the domain with the fungal cell wall. A full-length chitinase clone was isolated from a human macrophage cDNA plasmid library (16Chantry D. DeMaggio A.J. Brammer H. Raport C.J. Wood C.L. Schweickart V.L. Epp A. Smith A. Stine J.T. Walton K. Tjoelker L. Godiska R. Gray P.W. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 64: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This clone was used as a template for generation of all other expression constructs. A truncated form in which the region encoding the C-terminal 72 amino acids is deleted was generated by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)1 using primers anchored on the translation initiation codon (5′-CGCAAGCTTGAGAGCTCCGTTCCGCCACATGGTGCGGTCTGTGGCCTGGG) and terminating on the codon encoding Thr-394 (5′-GACTCTAGACTAGGTGCCTGAAGGCAAGTATGG). This PCR product was digested with HindIII and XbaI and cloned into the corresponding sites of the mammalian expression plasmid, pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). To generate secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP)-chitin-binding domain fusion proteins, PCR was used to obtain both the SEAP and the chitin-binding domain components. The SEAP component was amplified from the pSEAP2-Control plasmid (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) using primers that introduced a HindIII site to the 5′ end (5′-GCTTAAGCTTGCTGCAGCCTGCCGCTGAGCTGCATCATGCTACTACTACTGCTGCTGCTGGGCCTG) and a multiple cloning region to the 3′ end (5′-AACAGGGCCCTTAATTAATTAGGTACCTGCGCGGCCGCAGCATCGATTGCTCTAGAAGCGATATCAGCGAATTCTGTCTGCTCGAAGCGGCCGGCCGCCCCGACTCGAGAGTAAC). This PCR-generated cDNA was cloned into the HindIII andApaI sites of pcDNA3 to generate a vector called pcDNA-SEAP. A series of chitin-binding domain truncates was also generated by PCR, and they were cloned into the EcoRI andXbaI sites of the multiple cloning region of pcDNA-SEAP, thus generating constructs encoding SEAP with chitin-binding domain derivatives fused to its C terminus. The following PCR primers were used to generate the chitin-binding domain truncates. 395–466: sense, 5′-TATAGAATTCCCAGAGCTTGAAGTTCCAAAACCAG; antisense, 5′-AGAGTCTAGATCAATTCCAGGTGCAGCATTTGCAGG. 368–452: sense, 5′-TATAGAATTCTTCTCCTGCAACCAGGGCCGATAC; antisense, 5′-CACATCTAGATTATGTCGGGCAGCTTTGCTGGAACAG. 395–452: sense, 5′-TATAGAATTCCCAGAGCTTGAAGTTCCAAAACCAG; antisense, 5′-CACATCTAGATTATGTCGGGCAGCTTTGCTGGAACAG. 413–452: sense, 5′-TATAGAATTCAGCCCTGGACAAGACACGTTCTGCC; antisense, 5′-CACATCTAGATTATGTCGGGCAGCTTTGCTGGAACAG. 413–464: sense, 5′-TATAGAATTCAGCCCTGGACAAGACACGTTCTGCC; antisense, 5′-AACATCTAGATTAGGTGCAGCATTTGCAGGAGTTGCTGAAC. 368–466: sense, 5′-TATAGAATTCTTCTCCTGCAACCAGGGCCGATAC; antisense, 5′-AGAGTCTAGATCAATTCCAGGTGCAGCATTTGCAGG. 416–466: sense, 5′-CTCTGAATTCCAAGACACGTTCTGCCAGGGCAAAGCT; antisense, 5′-AGAGTCTAGATCAATTCCAGGTGCAGCATTTGCAGG. 416–466: sense, 5′-CTCTGAATTCCAAGACACGTTCTGCCAGGGCAAAGCT; antisense, 5′-AGAGTCTAGATCAATTCCAGGTGCAGCATTTGCAGG. 418–466: sense, 5′-ATATGAATTCACGTTCTGCCAGGGCAAAGCTGATG; antisense, 5′-AGAGTCTAGATCAATTCCAGGTGCAGCATTTGCAGG. 421–466: sense, 5′-AGAGGAATTCCAGGGCAAAGCTGATGGGCTCTATC; antisense, 5′-AGAGTCTAGATCAATTCCAGGTGCAGCATTTGCAGG. 430–466: sense, 5′-ACAGGAATTCAATCCTCGGGAACGGTCCAGCTTCTAC; antisense, 5′-AGAGTCTAGATCAATTCCAGGTGCAGCATTTGCAGG. Point mutations to convert cysteine residues to serine were generated with the PCR using primers that extended from the sequence encoding residue 413 at the 5′ end through the targeted cysteine (for Cys-420 and Cys-440) or the sequence encoding the stop codon at the 3′ end through the targeted cysteine (for Cys-450, Cys-460, Cys-462, and Cys-463). The following PCR primers were used. C420S: sense, 5′-AGAGGAATTCAGCCCTGGACAAGACACGTTCAGCC; antisense, 5′-AGAGTCTAGATCAATTCCAGGTGCAGCATTTGCAGG.

C463S: sense, 5′-TATAGAATTCAGCCCTGGACAAGACACGTTCTGCC; antisense, 5′-TGCTTCTAGATTAATTCCAGGTGCTGCATTTGCAGG. The resulting PCR products were digested with EcoRI and XbaI and cloned into the corresponding sites of the multiple cloning region of pcDNA-SEAP to generate fusion expression constructs. All PCRs contained 100 ng of template cDNA, 1 μg of each primer, 0.125 mm of each dNTP, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 50 mm MgCl2, and 2.5 units of Taqpolymerase. An initial denaturation step of 94 °C for 4 min was followed by 30 cycles of amplification as follows: 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 60 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C. Nucleotide sequences of all PCR-generated constructs were determined by dideoxy nucleotide sequencing to ensure the lack of errors. Expression plasmids were introduced into COS-7 cells grown to 50% confluency in 60-mm tissue culture dishes by incubation in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 0.5 mg/ml DEAE dextran, 0.1 mm chloroquine, and 10 μg of plasmid DNA for 1.5 h. The cells then were treated with 10% dimethyl sulfoxide in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 45 s, washed with serum-free medium, and incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum. After 4 days, culture media were harvested, and nonadherent cells were removed by centrifugation. To produce recombinant chitin-binding domain, an expression construct was designed in which the nucleotides encoding the C-terminal 54 amino acids of the chitinase were fused to the 3′ terminus of sequence encoding the Saccharomyces cerevisiae α-factor pre-pro sequence (18Brake A.J. Merryweather J.P. Coit D.G. Heberlein U.A. Masiarz F.R. Mullenbach G.T. Urdea M.S. Valenzuela P. Barr P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4642-4646Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). The PCR was used to generate a chitin-binding domain-encoding fragment (sense primer, 5′-AAGAGGTACCTTTGGATAAAAGAAGCCCTGGACAAGACACGTTCTGCC; antisense primer, 5′-GAGAGCGGCCGCGACTTAATTCCAGGTGCAGCATTTGCAGG), which was digested with Asp718 I and NotI, ligated into an expression cassette, and cloned into pSAC/VEC, a modified version of the disintegration vector pSAC35 (19Sleep D. Belfield G.P. Balance D.J. Steven J. Jones S. Evans L.R. Moir P.D. Goodey A.R. Bio/Technology. 1991; 9: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This shuttle vector is composed of a complete two micron plasmid with a LEU2d selectable marker and two repeated sequences flanking the pUC-derived E. coli origin of replication and β-lactamase resistance marker. The resulting pSAC2/AF/chitin-binding domain plasmid was transformed into theS. cerevisiae host strain IE41 (19Sleep D. Belfield G.P. Balance D.J. Steven J. Jones S. Evans L.R. Moir P.D. Goodey A.R. Bio/Technology. 1991; 9: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) (ciroleu2 pep4::URA3 L261) and selected by growth on leucine-deficient media. A selected clone was grown overnight at 30 °C in 10 ml of synthetic complete (BioWhittaker)-leu-ura medium containing 2% glucose. One ml of this culture was seeded into 100 ml of the same medium and incubated at 30 °C with shaking. After 19 h, 65 ml of the culture was seeded into 1.2 liters of medium in a 3-liter fermentor. The fermentation was carried out at 30 °C, pH 5.5, with 1200 rpm agitation and an airflow rate of 3 liters/min. After 93 h, cells were harvested by centrifugation. The supernatant was filtered through a prefilter and a 0.2 μm filter and stored at −20 °C until purification of the recombinant protein. The recombinant chitin-binding domain was purified by passing filtered culture medium through a chitin bead column. A 25-ml bed volume of chitin beads (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) was prepared in a 50-ml column (Amicon, Beverly, MA), prewashed with 250 ml of 1% SDS and equilibrated with 250 ml of Buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 8, 500 mm NaCl) at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. Clarified medium was passed through the chitin bead column at a rate of 1 ml/min. Following a 250-ml wash with Buffer A, protein was eluted from the beads with 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroactetate and collected into 4-ml fractions. Acetonitrile was evaporated from the eluate by vacuum centrifugation. Analysis of the purified protein by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry showed a single peak with molecular mass of 5911.9 Da, a value that corresponds favorably to the predicted mass of 5909.6 Da. Chitin binding activity was confirmed by readsorbing the purified protein to chitin beads and eluting with 1% SDS. Monoclonal antibodies were generated using standard protocols (20Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Hybridomas generated from BALB/c mice immunized with recombinant full-length chitinase were screened for chitinase-specific antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Antibody preparations from positive clones were further tested for specificity using Western analysis of complex tissue culture media from cells expressing recombinant chitinase. Binding sites of specific antibodies were mapped to either the N-terminal three-fourths of the molecule or the chitin-binding domain by Western blotting of recombinant truncated chitinase or chitin-binding domain. Tissue culture media from cells transfected with the SEAP-chitin-binding domain fusion expression constructs were assayed for alkaline phosphatase activity as described previously (21Berger J. Hauber J. Hauber R. Geiger R. Cullen B.R. Gene. 1988; 66: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar, 22Flanagan J.G. Leder P. Cell. 1990; 63: 185-194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples were incubated at 65 °C for 10 min to inactivate serum-derived phosphatases. Serial 10-fold dilutions were mixed with an equal volume of a 2× solution containing 2 m diethanolamine, pH 9.8, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 20 mml-homoarginine, and 24 mm p-nitrophenylphosphate. After a 30-min incubation at 37 °C, substrate metabolism was assessed by determination of theA 410. To determine chitin binding activity of COS-7 cell-produced fusion proteins, crab shell chitin (Sigma) was ground to a fine powder using a mortar and pestle, washed three times with Buffer A, and resuspended to 100 mg/ml. One hundred μl of the chitin suspension was added to 1 ml of transfected COS-7 cell medium, and the mixture was incubated 4 h at 4 °C with continuous end-over-end mixing. Following incubation, the chitin was pelleted by centrifugation (5 min at 12,000 × g). Supernatants were either assayed for SEAP activity (in the case of SEAP fusion proteins) or evaluated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Western blotting. For Western blotting, equivalent volumes of supernatant were supplemented with Laemmli buffer and 50 mm dithiothreitol, boiled, and electrophoresed through a 12% polyacrylamide gel (Novex, San Diego, CA). Contents of the gel were subsequently transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Novex) and detected using a monoclonal antibody specific for the N-terminal portion of chitinase. Binding specificity of the chitin-binding domain was determined by incubating the purified, recombinant material with the following insoluble polysaccharides: chitin beads (New England Biolabs), crab shell chitin, chitosan, carboxymethyl cellulose, curdlan, lichenan, mannan, and xylan (all from Sigma). Five hundred μl of recombinant chitin-binding domain at 200 μg/ml in Buffer A was added to 100 μg of washed matrix. After incubation at 23 °C for 30 min on a rocking platform, the insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. Chitin-binding domain remaining in solution was detected by electrophoresing equivalent volumes of the supernatants through a 4–20% gradient polyacrylamide gel (Novex) and staining the gel with Coomassie Blue stain (Gelcode, Pierce). Pelleted polysaccharides were washed twice with Buffer A and boiled in Laemmli buffer with 50 mm dithiothreitol. The resulting material in solution was electrophoresed and stained in parallel to the supernatants described above. Chitotriosidase activity was assayed as described (10Hollak C.E. van Weely S. van Oers M.H. Aerts J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1288-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar) using 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-d-N,N′,N″-triacetylchitotriose (Sigma) as the substrate. To assay for hydrolytic activity on insoluble chitin, ground and washed crab shell chitin (see above) was suspended to 0.4% in 1.5% molten agarose, 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6. The mixture was poured to a thickness of 2 mm in a 10-cm Petri dish and allowed to solidify. Wells 3 mm in diameter were cut into the agarose/chitin matrix. Prior to loading wells, the recombinant proteins in media from transfected COS-7 cells were concentrated 70-fold over a 30,000 molecular weight cutoff filter device (Amicon). Equivalent quantities of full-length and C-terminally truncated recombinant proteins were loaded into adjacent wells. A third well was loaded with concentrated medium from mock-transfected COS-7 cells. Plates were incubated for 48 h at 37 °C in a humidified chamber. After incubation, zones of clearing around the well indicate hydrolysis of the chitin. The chitin-binding domain (C-terminal 54 amino acids of human chitinase) was synthesized using in situ neutralization/HBTU activation protocols for Boc chemistry (23Schnolzer M. Alewood P. Jones A. Alewood D. Kent S.B.D. Int. J. Peptide Res. 1992; 40: 180-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). After synthesis, the final Boc group on the N terminus was removed, and 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine, succinimidyl ester (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was coupled selectively to the N-terminal amine group. Removal of side chain protecting groups and cleavage of polypeptide from resin was achieved by treatment with hydrogen fluoride. The labeled polypeptide was purified and analyzed by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography and electrospray mass spectrometry. The protein was folded and then purified again by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography. A colony of S. cerevisiae (ATCC catalog no. 9763) was inoculated into 3 ml of YEPD medium containing 2% glucose and grown at 37 °C for 16 h. Twenty μl of an overnight culture derived from a single colony ofCandida albicans (strain 32033) was used to innoculate 3 ml of YEPD medium containing 2% glucose and 10% fetal bovine serum (BioWhittaker) and was incubated at 37 °C for 16 h. Mucor rouxii (ATCC catalog no. 44260) was grown as yeast by inoculating spores into YPG medium (24Bartnicki-Garcia S. Nickerson W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 58: 102-119Crossref Scopus (219) Google Scholar) and incubating with stirring at 23 °C for 3 days under continuous CO2 flow. Neurospora crassa hyphal walls were generously provided by Dr. Claude Selitrennikoff (University of Colorado). Cells of all four organisms were pelleted by centrifugation, washed with PBS, and resuspended to high turbidity in PBS. To detect chitin, 30 μl of washed cells was mixed with either no fluorophore or with calcofluor white (BactiDrop, Remel, Lenexa, KS), 2 μg/ml of wheat germ agglutinin-FITC (Sigma), or 2 μg/ml of synthetic chitin-binding domain-rhodamine. Final volume was adjusted to 50 μl with PBS. To demonstrate that any labeling seen with chitin-binding domain-rhodamine was due to the chitin-binding domain, we included control tubes in which only the rhodamine component was added to cells at 20 μg/ml. For staining with calcofluor white, 30 μl of washed cells was pelleted in a microcentrifuge tube then resuspended in 30 μl of BactiDrop. All reactions were incubated on a rocking platform at 23 °C for 2 h in the dark. Following incubation, cells were pelleted, washed twice with PBS, and resuspended in ProLong mounting medium (Molecular Probes). A drop of suspended cells was applied to a glass slide and overlaid with a coverslip, and staining patterns were observed with fluorescence microscopy. Autofluorescence was negligible in control cells incubated in the absence of fluorescent reagents. Fig. 1 illustrates the proposed domain structure of human chitinase and presents the sequence of the C-terminal 72 amino acids. To assess the functional importance of the C-terminal portion of the enzyme, full-length chitinase and a truncated form lacking the C-terminal 72 amino acids were expressed in COS-7 cells. Chitin was incubated with media from the transfected cells then removed by centrifugation. As shown in Fig. 2, full-length chitinase was removed from solution by chitin, but the truncate was not. This is consistent with the prior observation that the C terminus is required for binding of the enzyme to native chitin (17Renkema G.H. Boot R.G. Strijland A. Donker-Koopman W.E. van den Berg M. Muijsers A.O. Aerts J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar).FIG. 2The C terminus is essential for binding of chitinase to chitin. Recombinant full-length chitinase (lanes 1 and 2) and chitinase with the C-terminal 72 amino acids deleted (lanes 3 and 4) (see Fig. 1) were expressed in COS-7 cells. Culture media from transfected COS-7 cells were incubated without (lanes 1 and 3) or with (lanes 2 and 4) crab shell chitin and centrifuged, and then supernatants were submitted to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Protein bands were detected by Western blotting. The absence of a band in lane 2 but not in lane 4demonstrates that the full-length but not the truncated chitinase is precipitated by chitin. M designates lane containing molecular weight makers.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The enzymatic activities of the two forms of chitinase were also compared. Using equivalent molar quantities of each form, we found equivalent substrate turnover when the soluble substrate, 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-d-N,N′,N″-triacetylchitotriose was used (Fig. 3 A). This was not the case, however, with native chitin as substrate. In an agar diffusion assay in which particulate crab shell chitin was incorporated into agarose, the full-length chitinase generated a zone of clearing around the well of origin (Fig. 3 B). In contrast, no clearing of the substrate could be detected around the well containing the truncated enzyme. These observations suggest that although the chitin-binding domain does not appear to affect the catalytic site of the enzyme, its presence is essential for the enzyme to act upon insoluble chitin. The above experiments demonstrate that the C-terminal 72 amino acids of chitinase are sufficient to mediate all of its binding to native chitin. To determine the minimal number of residues necessary to accomplish this binding, we designed a series of expression constructs in which chitin-binding domain derivatives were fused to the C terminus of the human placental SEAP (21Berger J. Hauber J. Hauber R. Geiger R. Cullen B.R. Gene. 1988; 66: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). Media from COS-7 cells transfected with the constructs were assayed for SEAP activity both before and after incubation with crab shell chitin. Depletion of SEAP activity from the media after incubation with chitin indicates a chitin-binding domain-mediated precipitation of the fusion protein. As presented in Fig. 4, 80% of the fusion protein containing the full 72-residue chitin-binding domain (construct 395–466) was depleted from the medium by chitin. This level of depletion was retained with the removal of up to 23 amino acids from the N terminus of the domain (construct 418–466). Removal of three additional residues, however, completely abolished the ability of chitin to precipitate the fusion protein from the medium (construct 421–466). Interestingly, the C terminus of the domain is critical; deletion of as few as two amino acids completely abolished binding activity (construct 413–464). Thus, the minimal chitin-binding domain is composed of the most C-terminal 49 amino acids of chitinase. In order to generate pure chitin-binding domain for further characterization, we constructed a S. cerevisiaeexpression plasmid that encodes the C-terminal 54 amino acids of chitinase fused to the yeast α-factor pre-pro sequence (18Brake A.J.

https://openalex.org/W2329191923,"Membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGI)-1/BAI-associated protein (BAP) 1 and Synapse-associated protein (SAP) 97/human Discs-large tumor suppressor gene (hDLG) are ubiquitous isoforms of synaptic scaffolding molecule (S-SCAM) and Postsynaptic density (PSD)-95/SAP90, both of which are implicated in the structures of synapses, respectively. SAP97/hDLG is localized at epithelial junctions and may function as a scaffolding protein, but the subcellular localization or the function of MAGI-1/BAP1 has not been clarified. In intestinal epithelial cells, MAGI-1/BAP1 was localized at tight junctions, whereas SAP97/hDLG was localized diffusely at cell - cell junctions. In Madine Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, MAGI-1/BAP1 was colocalized with ZO-1, whereas SAP97/hDLG was colocalized with E-cadherin. In MDCK cells, dominant active and negative mutants of Rac1 small G protein changed the amounts of SAP97/hDLG at cell - cell junctions, but not that of MAGI-1/BAP1. When MDCK cells were switched to a low Ca2+ medium, E-cadherin disappeared from the plasma membrane, and cells were dissociated. The phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-treatment after the low Ca2+ switch induced a tight junction-like structure. MAGI-1/BAP1 was recruited with ZO-1 to this structure, but SAP97/hDLG or E-cadherin was not. These findings suggest that MAGI-1/BAP1 is a component of tight junctions of epithelial cells, and that its role is different from that of SAP97/hDLG."
https://openalex.org/W2086354706,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is overexpressed in hyperproliferative diseases, such as psoriasis and cancers, which are characterized by increased angiogenesis. Experimentally, VEGF overexpression can be induced by the treatment of cell cultures and biological tissues with phorbol esters, such as 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). Using normal human keratinocytes in conventional cultures and skin grafted onto nude mice in vivo, we show that retinoids can inhibit TPA-mediated VEGF gene induction at the transcriptional level. Because retinoids are biologically active either by interacting with the nuclear retinoic acid receptors or by interfering with the activator protein 1 (AP1) transcription factor, we studied the effect of the retinoic acid derivative CD 2409, which exhibits strong anti-AP1 activity but does not bind to the known retinoic acid receptors in vitro. The results demonstrate that the inhibition of VEGF expression by retinoids only depends on their anti-AP1 activity and does not require gene transactivation via retinoic acid response elements. Because the VEGF promoter contains four potential AP1 binding sites, we used different promoter constructs to identify the functional site responsible for TPA induction and retinoid inhibition. This site turned out to be localized at position -621 of the 5' flanking region of the VEGF gene."
https://openalex.org/W2063130162,"We determined the effect of nucleotides and protein kinase A (PKA) on the Ca2+-dependent gating of the cloned intermediate conductance, Ca2+-dependent K+ channel, hIK1. In Xenopus oocytes, during two-electrode voltage-clamp, forskolin plus isobutylmethylxanthine induced a Ca2+-dependent increase in hIK1 activity. In excised inside-out patches, addition of ATP induced a Ca2+-dependent increase in hIK1 activity (NPo). In contrast, neither nonhydrolyzable (AMP-PNP, AMP-PCP) nor hydrolyzable ATP analogs (GTP, CTP, UTP, and ITP) activated hIK1. The ATP-dependent activation of hIK1 required Mg2+ and was reversed by either exogenous alkaline phosphatase or the PKA inhibitor PKI5–24. The Ca2+ dependence of hIK1 activation was best fit with a stimulatory constant (K s) of 350 nm and a Hill coefficient (n) of 2.3. ATP increased NPo at [Ca2+] >100 nm while having no effect on K s or n. Mutation of the single PKA consensus phosphorylation site at serine 334 to alanine (S334A) had no effect on the PKA-dependent activation during either two-electrode voltage-clamp or in excised inside-out patches. When expressed in HEK293 cells, ATP activated hIK1 in a Mg2+-dependent fashion, being reversed by alkaline phosphatase. Neither PKI5–24 nor CaMKII281–309 or PKC19–31 affected the ATP-dependent activation. Northern blot analysis revealed hIK1 expression in the T84 colonic cell line. Endogenous hIK1 was activated by ATP in a Mg2+- and PKI5–24-dependent fashion and was reversed by alkaline phosphatase, whereas CaMKII281–309 and PKC19–31 had no effect on the ATP-dependent activation. The Ca2+-dependent activation (K s and n) was unaffected by ATP. In conclusion, hIK1 is activated by a membrane delimited PKA when endogenously expressed. Although the oocyte expression system recapitulates this regulation, expression in HEK293 cells does not. The effect of PKA on hIK1 gating is Ca2+-dependent and occurs via an increase in NPo without an effect on either Ca2+ affinity or apparent cooperativity. We determined the effect of nucleotides and protein kinase A (PKA) on the Ca2+-dependent gating of the cloned intermediate conductance, Ca2+-dependent K+ channel, hIK1. In Xenopus oocytes, during two-electrode voltage-clamp, forskolin plus isobutylmethylxanthine induced a Ca2+-dependent increase in hIK1 activity. In excised inside-out patches, addition of ATP induced a Ca2+-dependent increase in hIK1 activity (NPo). In contrast, neither nonhydrolyzable (AMP-PNP, AMP-PCP) nor hydrolyzable ATP analogs (GTP, CTP, UTP, and ITP) activated hIK1. The ATP-dependent activation of hIK1 required Mg2+ and was reversed by either exogenous alkaline phosphatase or the PKA inhibitor PKI5–24. The Ca2+ dependence of hIK1 activation was best fit with a stimulatory constant (K s) of 350 nm and a Hill coefficient (n) of 2.3. ATP increased NPo at [Ca2+] >100 nm while having no effect on K s or n. Mutation of the single PKA consensus phosphorylation site at serine 334 to alanine (S334A) had no effect on the PKA-dependent activation during either two-electrode voltage-clamp or in excised inside-out patches. When expressed in HEK293 cells, ATP activated hIK1 in a Mg2+-dependent fashion, being reversed by alkaline phosphatase. Neither PKI5–24 nor CaMKII281–309 or PKC19–31 affected the ATP-dependent activation. Northern blot analysis revealed hIK1 expression in the T84 colonic cell line. Endogenous hIK1 was activated by ATP in a Mg2+- and PKI5–24-dependent fashion and was reversed by alkaline phosphatase, whereas CaMKII281–309 and PKC19–31 had no effect on the ATP-dependent activation. The Ca2+-dependent activation (K s and n) was unaffected by ATP. In conclusion, hIK1 is activated by a membrane delimited PKA when endogenously expressed. Although the oocyte expression system recapitulates this regulation, expression in HEK293 cells does not. The effect of PKA on hIK1 gating is Ca2+-dependent and occurs via an increase in NPo without an effect on either Ca2+ affinity or apparent cooperativity. cAMP-dependent kinase two-electrode voltage-clamp N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-ethylenediamine-triacetic acid adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate adenosine 5′-(β,γ-methylene)triphosphate isobutylmethylxanthine charybdotoxin protein kinase C calmodulin kinase II A-kinase anchoring protein cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator Ca2+-dependent K+ channels (KCa) participate in a multitude of physiological processes by coupling intracellular Ca2+ signaling to membrane voltage in both excitable and nonexcitable cells. Traditionally, KCa channels have been classified as large (BKCa), small (SKCa), and intermediate (IKCa) conductance based on their single channel conductance in symmetric K+ solutions (1Vergara C. Latorre R. Marrion N.V. Adelman J.P. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar, 2Latorre R. Oberhauser A. Labarca P. Alvarez O. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1989; 51: 385-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). BKCa and SKCa channels have been studied extensively in neurons where these channels contribute to action potential repolarization and hyperpolarization. In contrast, the IKCa channels have been shown to function primarily in a variety of peripheral nonexcitable cells including secretory epithelia (3Devor D.C. Frizzell R.A. Am. J.

Immunol. 1996; 156: 1425-1430PubMed Google Scholar). Although Ca2+ is the primary regulator of KCa channel gating, phosphorylation has been reported to modulate each of these KCa channels (11Levitan I.B. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 193-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Because Ca2+ and cAMP act in concert to modulate a diverse array of physiological processes, an understanding of the integration between phosphorylation and Ca2+ at the level of these K+ channels is critical in fully appreciating their role in these processes. This synergism between Ca2+ and cAMP has been most extensively studied on the BKCa channels; PKA-mediated phosphorylation alters both the Ca2+ and voltage sensitivity of these channels (12De Peyer J.E.

Neurosci. 1991; 11: 1627-1635Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, the PKA phosphorylation site underlying this response has recently been identified (15Nara M. Dhulipala P.D.K. Wang Y.-X. Kotlikoff M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14920-14924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We previously characterized an IKCa channel in both colonic and airway epithelia that was activated by Ca2+-mediated agonists (3Devor D.C. Frizzell R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C1271-C1280Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Devor D.C. Singh A.K. Lambert L.C. DeLuca A. Frizzell R.A. Bridges R.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 743-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). These channels were blocked with high affinity by both charybdotoxin (16Devor D.C. Singh A.K. Frizzell R.A. Bridges R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: L775-L784PubMed Google Scholar) and clotrimazole (17Devor D.C. Singh A.K. Gerlach A.C. Frizzell R.A. Bridges R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C531-C540Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Rufo P.A. Jiang L. Moe S.J. Brugnara C. Alper S.L. Lencer W.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2066-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Activation of these channels is critical to maintaining the electrochemical driving force for transepithelial Cl− secretion. This is especially true in colonic epithelia, where it was originally proposed that Ca2+-mediated agonists stimulate Cl− secretion solely via the activation of basolateral membrane K+channels, relying on constitutively active apical membrane Cl− channels to carry current across the apical membrane (19Dharmsathaphorn K. Pandol S.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 77: 348-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Ca2+- and cAMP-mediated agonists produce synergistic effects on Cl− secretion across colonic epithelia (20Barrett K.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C859-C868Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although it is generally thought that this effect is due to cAMP-dependent kinase (PKA)1 activation of apical membrane CFTR, thereby removing apical chloride conductance from being rate-limiting, the synergistic effects of these two agonists on IKCa has been little studied. Indeed, in airway epithelia, norepinephrine functions as a dual agonist, simultaneously raising both Ca2+ and cAMP, resulting in the activation of IKCa (21Welsh M.J. McCann J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8823-8826Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Thus, IKCa channels are likely under a dual modulatory role in secretory epithelia being activated by Ca2+ as well as PKA. However, in contrast to the BKCa channels, a detailed understanding of the mechanism by which PKA-dependent phosphorylation modulates the Ca2+-dependent gating of IKCachannels has not been reported. Ishii et al. (22Ishii T.M. Silvia C. Hirschberg B. Bond C.T. Adelman J.P. Maylie J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11651-11656Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar) and Joiner et al. (23Joiner W.J. Wang L.Y. Tang M.D. Kaczmarek L.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11013-11018Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) recently reported the cloning of an IKCa channel. This cloned channel exhibits an identical biophysical and pharmacological profile to that which we previously reported for the IKCa channel expressed in the colonic cell line, T84. We took advantage of the recent cloning of hIK1 to further define the mechanism by which PKA-dependent phosphorylation modulates the Ca2+-dependent gating of hIK1. We demonstrate that hIK1 is activated via a membrane-associated PKA and that the stimulatory effect of PKA is Ca2+-dependent, resulting in an increase in total current flow (NPo) while having no effect on either the affinity or apparent cooperativity of hIK1 for Ca2+. However, the stimulatory effect of PKA-mediated phosphorylation on hIK1 activity is independent of the only PKA consensus site, serine 334. These results suggest that the Ca2+- and cAMP-dependent signaling pathways intersect at the level of hIK1 to modulate transepithelial ion transport. Xenopus laevis care and handling procedures were in accordance with University of Pittsburgh guidelines. X. laevis were obtained from either Xenopus 1 (Dexter, MI) or Nasco (Fort Atkinson, WI). Frogs were anesthetized with 3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester, the ovaries were surgically removed, and the oocytes were dissected in modified Barth's solution containing 88 mm NaCl, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 1 mm KCl, 0.82 mm MgSO4, 0.33 mm Ca(NO3), 0.41 mmCaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. The oocyte follicular cells were removed by incubation in 5 mg/ml collagenase (Life Technologies, Inc.) plus 0.5 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor in Ca2+-free ND-96 (96 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 5 mm HEPES; pH adjusted to 7.5 with NaOH) at room temperature for ∼60 min. The oocytes were then incubated in 100 mm K2HPO4 (pH adjusted to 6.5 with HCl) containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 30 min to remove any remaining follicular cells. Stage 5 and 6 oocytes were presorted and allowed to incubate overnight in modified Barth's solution at 20 °C prior to injection of cRNA. Dr. John Adelman (Vollum Institute, Oregon Health Sciences University) generously provided hIK1 cDNA in the oocyte expression vector pBF containing both 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of the Xenopusβ-globin gene flanking the multi-cloning site. The plasmid was linearized using PvuI (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 5′ capped cRNAs were generated using SP6 polymerase (mMESSAGE mMACHINETM In Vitro Transcription Kit, Ambion). cRNAs were evaluated both spectrophotometrically and by agarose gel electrophoresis with ethidium bromide staining. Oocytes were injected with 5–50 ng of cRNA 2–7 days prior to recording. Oocytes were mounted in a recording chamber maintained at room temperature. Macroscopic currents were measured with the two-electrode voltage-clamp method using a GeneClamp 500B amplifier (Axon Instruments). Data were sampled at 100 Hz using Axoscope software (Axon Instruments). Electrodes were fabricated from borosilicate glass (Kimax-51, Kimble) and pulled on a vertical puller (Narishige) having a resistance of 0.3–5 MΩ when filled with 3 m KCl. Oocytes were continuously superfused with high K+-ND96 containing 96 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, and 5 mm HEPES (pH adjusted to 7.5 with KOH) at room temperature and held at a holding voltage of −60 mV such that activation of a K+ current resulted in an inward current flow. hIK1 was subcloned from pBF into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) and transfected into HEK293 cells using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturers instruction's. Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum and maintained under continuous selection using G418 (1 mg/ml). The oocyte vitelline membrane was mechanically dissected prior to patch-clamping in a hypertonic solution containing 200 mm potassium gluconate, 20 mmKCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES (pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH). Single-channel currents were recorded in the inside-out patch configuration using an Axon 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments) and stored on videotape for later analysis. Pipettes were fabricated from number 8161 glass (World Precision Instruments) and heat polished to resistances of 3–6 MΩ. The pipette solution contained 145 mm potassium gluconate, 5 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 1 mm EGTA (pH adjusted to 7.4 with KOH). The bath contained 145 mm potassium gluconate, 5 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 1 mm EGTA (pH adjusted to 7.2 with KOH). Sufficient CaCl2 was added to obtain the desired free [Ca2+] (program kindly provided by Dr. Dave Dawson, University of Michigan). For experiments with no added Ca2+, Ca2+ was excluded from the bath, and EGTA was maintained at 1 mm (estimated free Ca2+<10 nm). For Mg2+ free experiments, 1 mm N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-ethylenediamine-triacetic acid (HEDTA) was added to the bath solution in the absence of added MgCl2. Ca2+ was clamped at a free concentration of 10 μm in all conditions with the Ca2+ and Mg2+ chelating properties of HEDTA, EGTA, and ATP taken into account using Maxchelator, version 1.7 (24Bers D.M. Patton C.W. Nuccitelli R. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 40: 3-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). All recordings were done at a holding potential of −100 mV. The voltage is referenced to the extracellular compartment, as is the standard method for membrane potentials. Inward currents are defined as the movement of positive charge from the extracellular compartment to the intracellular compartment and are presented as downward deflections from the base line in all recording configurations. Single-channel analysis was performed on records sampled after low pass filtering at 400 Hz. The NPo (the product of the number of channels and the channel open probability) of the channels was determined using Biopatch software (version 3.3, Bio-Logic). NPo was calculated from the mean total current (I) divided by the single channel current amplitude (i), such that NPo = I/i. The single channel current amplitude was determined from the best gaussian fit of the amplitude histogram. Changes in [Ca2+] or [ATP] were not found to alter thei of hIK1 in low activity patches. Therefore, to determine NPo for high activity patches, Ca2+ was titrated at the end of an experiment until i could accurately be determined by amplitude histogram analysis. Diary plots were constructed by averaging NPo over a range of 30–120-s intervals of the experimental record. Ser334 was mutated to alanine (S334A) using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Polymerase chain reactions were carried out using a CGCAGGAAGGAGGCTCATGCTGCCCG primer coupled with a complimentary primer, where the bold letter indicates the change from wild type hIK1. Point mutations were confirmed by sequencing (ABI PRISM 377 automated sequencer, University of Pittsburgh) and sequence alignment (NCBI Blast 2.0) with hIK1 (accession number AF022150). Poly(A)+ mRNA was isolated from confluent T84 and Calu-3 monolayers using the Fast track 2.0 kit (Invitrogen). 3 μg of mRNA was run in a 1% agarose gel and transferred to nitrocellulose. The blot was probed in Expresshyb solution (CLONTECH) at 68 °C with [32P]dCTP-labeled DNA fragments made by random priming of a cDNA template corresponding to amino acid residues 319–427 of hIK1 and including 100 base pairs of 3′-untranslated sequence, stringently washed at 65 °C with 0.1× SSPE, 0.1% SDS and exposed to film for 24 h at −80 °C with two intensifying screens. T84 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 (1:1) supplemented with 14 mm NaHCO3, 10% newborn calf serum, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. Calu-3 cells were grown Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 (1:1) supplemented with 14 mm NaHCO3, 15% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. All cells were incubated in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C, and the medium was replaced every 2 days. For patch-clamp experiments, cells were plated onto glass coverslips 6–48 h prior to experimentation. Ionomycin, forskolin, AMP-PNP, AMP-PCP, GTP, PKI5–24, CaMKII281–309, PKC19–31, and H-89 were purchased from Calbiochem. CTP, UTP, ITP, ADP, IBMX, and alkaline and acid phosphatase were obtained from Sigma. ATP was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Charybdotoxin was obtained from Accurate Chemical and Scientific and was made as a 10 μm stock solution in water. Ionomycin was made as a 5,000-fold stock solution in Me2SO, forskolin as a 1,000-fold stock solution in ethanol, H-89 as a 1,000-fold stock solution in Me2SO, CaMKII281–309 and PKC19–31 as a 1000-fold stock solution in water, and PKI5–24 as 10,000-fold stock solution in water. All data are presented as the means ± S.E., where n indicates the number of experiments. Statistical analysis was performed using a Student's ttest. A value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant and reported. Nonlinear curve fitting of the concentration-response data were iteratively fitted with a Michaelis-Menten-Hill equation using SigmaPlot (version 3.0; Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA). Initially we determined whether hIK1 heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes could be activated by the cAMP elevating agents forskolin (10 μm) and IBMX (1 mm) using the TEVC technique. As shown in Fig. 1, addition of forskolin and IBMX alone had no effect on current flow across the oocyte membrane. In 14 experiments the control current averaged −0.13 ± 0.03 μA, and this was not increased by forskolin/IBMX (−0.14 ± 0.01 μA). Following washout of the forskolin/IBMX mixture, addition of the Ca2+ ionophore, ionomycin (1 μm) resulted in an increase in inward current, consistent with activation of hIK1 in our recording conditions (see “Materials and Methods”). Following establishment of a stable current, the reapplication of forskolin/IBMX in the continued presence of ionomycin resulted in a potentiated current that was sensitive to inhibition by the known hIK1 inhibitor, charybdotoxin (CTX, 50 nm). In 14 experiments, ionomycin increased current to −1.33 ± 0.36 μA, and this was further increased 2-fold by the addition of forskolin/IBMX to −2.51 ± 0.42 μA (p < 0.001). Addition of CTX reduced current to −0.44 ± 0.14 μA. Noninjected oocytes responded to neither ionomycin nor forskolin/IBMX (n = 6; data not shown). These data demonstrate that although elevated cAMP alone does not activate hIK1, it produces a synergistic activation in the presence of elevated intracellular Ca2+. Our TEVC results suggest that PKA-mediated phosphorylation of hIK1 results in activation of the channel in a Ca2+-dependent manner. To define this mechanism of activation we utilized the excised inside-out patch-clamp technique on Xenopus oocytes heterologously expressing hIK1. Initially, we confirmed expression of hIK1 based on its current-voltage (I-V) relationship, Ca2+ dependence and inhibition by clotrimazole (data not shown). Based on the Ca2+ dependence of hIK1, we utilized 400 nmfree Ca2+ in our studies, because either an increase or decrease in hIK1 NPo could readily be resolved. Similar to what has been reported for a wide range of ion channels, following patch excision, hIK1 activity (NPo) slowly declined until a new steady-state level was achieved (Fig. 2 B). Following this “rundown” in activity, channels could easily be resolved as shown for one patch in Fig. 2 A. To begin to elucidate the mechanism by which phosphorylation activates hIK1, we perfused ATP (1 mm) into the bath to provide substrate for exogenously added PKA. However, as shown in Fig. 2, addition of ATP alone resulted in the activation of hIK1. Indeed, upon perfusion of ATP, hIK1 activity slowly and steadily increased to levels greater than or equal to the activity first seen upon patch excision. Following the establishment of a new steady-state NPo, activity remained stable until the end of the experiment (Fig. 2 B). Removal of Ca2+, in the continued presence of ATP, resulted in a complete inhibition of channel activity, demonstrating an absolute requirement for Ca2+ in the gating of hIK1. In 44 experiments ATP increased NPo from 2.16 ± 0.50 to 5.79 ± 1.28 (p < 0.001). Removal of bath Ca2+ resulted in a decrease in NPo to 0.018 ± 0.006. The single channel current amplitude was unaffected by ATP (control, i = 3.15 ± 0.12; ATP,i = 3.18 ± 0.05) as determined by the best gaussian fit to the single channel current amplitude distribution. These data suggest a role for nucleotide binding, hydrolysis, and or phosphorylation in the regulation of hIK1. Our results demonstrate that ATP activates hIK1 in excised inside-out patches. This activation could be due to a direct effect of nucleotides on hIK1 or a secondary effect via an associated kinase. In an initial attempt to distinguish among these possibilities, we determined the effect of several additional nucleotides, both hydrolyzable and nonhydrolyzable. As shown in Fig. 3 A, addition of the poorly hydrolyzable ATP analog, AMP-PCP (300 μm) had no effect on channel gating. However, subsequent addition of ATP (300 μm) resulted in a 6-fold increase in NPo, as described above. Similarly, AMP-PNP (300 μm) failed to activate hIK1 (Fig. 3 B). The average data for these nucleotides are shown in Fig. 3 B. In the presence of 400 nm Ca2+, NPo averaged 1.88 ± 0.64 (n = 7), which was not significantly affected by either AMP-PNP (1.88 ± 0.49) or AMP-PCP (1.99 ± 0.85), whereas the subsequent addition of ATP increased NPo to 7.38 ± 2.48 (p < 0.01). These results suggest that the ATP-dependent activation of hIK1 is not directly nucleotide-dependent and further indicate the possible involvement of an associated kinase. Based on our above results we evaluated the effects of additional nucleotides on hIK1 activity. The results of these experiments are summarized in Fig. 3 B. In four experiments sequential addition of the hydrolyzable nucleotide triphosphates GTP, CTP, UTP, and ITP (all 300 μm) failed to induce an increase in channel activity. However, the subsequent perfusion of ATP (300 μm) resulted in a 2.5-fold increase in NPo(control, NPo = 0.91 ± 0.25; ATP, NPo = 2.47 ± 0.44; p < 0.001). To determine whether the γ-phosphate of ATP is important for hIK1 activation, we evaluated the effect of ADP on hIK1 activity. Like the other nucleotides, ADP failed to activate hIK1 (control, NPo = 1.16 ± 0.41; ADP, NPo = 1.16 ± 0.35), whereas the addition of ATP increased NPo to 2.28 ± 0.46 (n = 5). Finally, we determined whether cAMP could activate hIK1. However, as shown in Fig. 3 B, cAMP failed to modulate hIK1 activity (n = 6). These results demonstrate an absolute requirement for both adenosine and a hydrolyzable γ-phosphate in the nucleotide-dependent activation of hIK1. Our nucleotide results suggest that the ATP-dependent activation of hIK1 relies upon nucleotide hydrolysis and/or phosphorylation. To further evaluate this possibility, we determined whether the ATP-dependent stimulation of hIK1 requires Mg2+; Mg2+ is a necessary cofactor for ATP to serve as a substrate for ATPases and kinases. For these experiments free Ca2+ was maintained at 10 μm. As shown in Fig. 4, addition of ATP (1 mm) in the absence of Mg2+failed to activate hIK1 in excised inside-out patches. However, the subsequent addition of Mg2+ (2.5 mm) in the continued presence of ATP resulted in activation of hIK1. This effect was reversible, because removal of Mg2+ resulted in a decrease in channel activity. The time course for one such experiment is illustrated as a diary plot in Fig. 4 B. In seven experiments, control NPo was 22.52 ± 6.69, and this was not affected by addition of ATP in the absence of Mg2+(17.96 ± 5.85), whereas the readdition of Mg2+resulted in an increase in NPo to 28.68 ± 8.65 (p < 0.01). These results further suggest that the ATP-dependent activation of hIK1 is dependent upon hydrolysis and/or phosphorylation and is not due to direct nucleotide interaction. To discriminate between ATP hydrolysis and phosphorylation in the ATP-dependent activation of hIK1, we evaluated the effect of exogenously added alkaline phosphatase. Alkaline phosphatase would be expected to reverse only phosphorylation-dependent activation of hIK1. The results of one experiment are shown in Fig. 5. Following activation of hIK1 with ATP (1 mm), addition of alkaline phosphatase (5 units/ml) reduced channel activity (NPo) to below control levels. Indeed, removal of ATP, in the continued presence of alkaline phosphatase resulted in a further decrease in channel activity, which was recoverable upon readdition of ATP. In six experiments ATP increased NPo from 4.91 ± 2.38 to 13.88 ± 4.75 with the subsequent perfusion of alkaline phosphatase reducing NPo to 5.10 32 ± 1.57 (p < 0.05). Following washout of ATP, alkaline phosphatase alone further reduced NPo to 2.40 ± 0.84. The subsequent addition of ATP increased NPo to 10.68 ± 3.59, and this was completely reversed by removal of Ca2+ (NPo = 0.06 ± 0.05). Similar to our results with alkaline phosphatase, acid phosphatase (5 units/ml) reversed the ATP-dependent activation of hIK1 (control, NPo = 1.86 ± 1.94; ATP, NPo = 21.11 ± 7.68; ATP + acid phosphatase, NPo = 4.88 ± 0.97; n = 5, p < 0.05). These data suggest that the ATP-induced activation of hIK1 is due to phosphorylation of hIK1 itself or of a closely associated protein. Our results demonstrate that alkaline phosphatase reduced hIK1 activity to below control levels, suggesting that some base-line activity of hIK1 is due to the channel being in a phosphorylated state. This possibility was evaluated by determining the effect of alkaline phosphatase on hIK1 following patch excision prior to addition of ATP. As shown in Fig. 6 (A andB) addition of alkaline phosphatase (5 units/ml) resulted in a decrease in channel activity to below control levels that was not reversed upon washout; consistent with a portion of this base-line activity being due to phosphorylated channels. The subsequent addition of ATP (1 mm) resulted in a large increase in NPo. As summarized in Fig. 6 C, alkaline phosphatase reduced NPo from 12.02 ± 3.18 to 5.59 ± 1.35 (n = 7, p < 0.05) with washout having no effect on NPo (6.06 ± 1.53). The subsequent perfusion of ATP increased NPo to 18.07 ± 5.06 (p < 0.01). These data further suggest that phosphorylation of hIK1 and/or a closely associated protein can modulate its activity. Our TEVC data suggest that a PKA-dependent pathway can activate hIK1 in the presence of elevated Ca2+. Also, our patch-clamp data suggest that PKA could be associated with the membrane. Based on these studies, we determined whether the PKA inhibitors PKI5–24 and H-89 could inhibit the ATP-dependent activation of hIK1 in excised inside-out patches. As shown in Fig. 7, subsequent to activation of hIK1 by ATP, addition of PKI5–24 (100 nm) reduced channel activity, which was recovered upon washout of PKI5–24. The time course for this experiment is shown as a diary plot in Fig. 7 B. In 10 experiments ATP (1 mm) increased NPo from 1.94 ± 0.81 to 4.53 ± 1.68, and this was subsequently reduced to 3.39 ± 1.34 (p < 0.05) upon addition of PKI5–24. Similarly, H-89 (2 μm) reduced NPo from 8.27 ± 2.97 to 5.25 ± 3.17 (p < 0.01,n = 5). These results suggest that the ATP-dependent activation is via a PKA-mediated phosphorylation event. Phosphorylation of BK channels has been shown to alter their Ca2+ dependence such that there is a parallel shift in the Po versus voltage relation"

The p38 kinase inhibitor, SB203580, partially protects HeLa-ER5 cells against apoptosis induced by E2 or by OHT. E2 induces the p38 pathway 12–36-fold in ER-positive cell lines, while OHT induces p38 activity 2–5-fold. In an ER-positive cell line selected for resistance to E2-induced apoptosis, E2 no longer induced p38, and the ER no longer bound to the estrogen response element, while OHT induced both p38 and apoptosis. In cells selected for resistance to OHT-induced apoptosis, OHT no longer induced p38, while E2 induced p38 and apoptosis, and transactivated an estrogen response element-containing reporter gene. In MCF-7 cells, whose growth is stimulated by estrogen, E2 did not induce p38 or apoptosis, while OHT induced both p38 and apoptosis, and SB203580 protected against OHT-induced apoptosis. This work shows that E2 and OHT activate the p38 pathway, suggests that they use different pathways for p38 activation, and links activation of the p38 pathway to apoptosis induced by E2 and by OHT. 17β-Estradiol (E2) or the antiestrogen, 4-hydroxytamoxifen (OHT), induce apoptosis in stably transfected estrogen receptor (ER)-positive HeLa-ER5 cells. p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase is implicated in cellular processes involving apoptosis.

Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2435-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar), the 3 Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) (2Minden A. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: F85-104PubMed Google Scholar), and the p38 MAP kinases (3Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5028) Google Scholar) (also termed stress-activated protein kinase 2). The p38 MAP kinase pathway is activated by proinflammatory cytokines and by environmental stress (4Paul A. Wilson S. Belham C.M. Robinson C.J. Scott P.H. Gould G.W. Plevin R. Cell Signal. 1997; 9: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). While the ERK kinases are activated by mitogenic stimuli, activation of the p38 pathway is strongly correlated with apoptosis (3Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5028) Google Scholar). Although the relationship between p38 activation and apoptosis is not well understood, a recent report links activation of p38 and the induction of apoptosis. p38 kinase, activated by UV light, was shown to phosphorylate the p53 tumor suppresser (5Huang C. Ma W.-Y. Maxiner A. Sun Y. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12229-12235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of p53 is coupled to its ability to activate transcription of genes involved in control of cell cycle progression and apoptosis (6Martinez J.D. Page G. Lohrum M. Sweiland S. Scheidtmann K.-H. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 953-961PubMed Google Scholar, 7Mine D.M. Campbell D.G. Caudwell F.B. Meek D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9253-9260PubMed Google Scholar). The estrogen, 17β-estradiol (E2), can stimulate proliferation, or induce differentiation or death depending on the cell context. In estrogen receptor (ER)-positive MCF-7 human breast cancer cells, E2 strongly stimulates cell proliferation and does not induce cell death. In contrast, in several types of stably transfected cell lines expressing significant levels of ER, E2 is highly toxic and induces cell death (8Kushner P.J. Hort E. Shine J. Baxter J.D. Greene G.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1465-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 9Zhang C.C. Krieg S. Shapiro D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 632-643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The clinically important antiestrogen, tamoxifen, or its active metabolite, 4-hydroxytamoxifen (OHT), also induces cell death in ER-positive cell lines (10Coradini D. Biffi A. Cappelletti V. Di Fronzo G. Anticancer Res. 1994; 14: 1059-1064PubMed Google Scholar, 11Perry R.R. Kang Y. Greaves B. Ann. Surg. Oncol. 1995; 2: 238-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 12Chen H.

While most studies of ER, and of the other steroid/nuclear receptors, have centered on their ability to act as ligand-regulated nuclear transcription factors, recent studies demonstrate that ER also exerts non-genomic effects (14Morey A.K.

Some non-genomic effects of ER may be related to its ability to activate signaling pathways, such as nitric-oxide synthase in endothelial cells (18Chen Z. Yuhanna I.S. Galcheva-Gargova Z. Karas R.H. Mendelsohn M.E. Shaul P.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar) and the p21 ras /MAP kinase pathway (19Migliaccio A. Piccolo D. Castoria G. Di Domenico M. Bilancio A. Lombardi M. Gong W. Beato M. Auricchio F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2008-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). We recently described several lines of HeLa cells stably transfected to express ER. These HeLa-ER cell lines are killed by E2 or by OHT (9Zhang C.C. Krieg S. Shapiro D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 632-643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this work, we show that the specific inhibitor of the p38 MAP kinase pathway SB203580 (20Guenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F. Young P.R. Lee J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1973) Google Scholar) partially protects the HeLa-ER cells against E2 or OHT-induced apoptosis. We show that E2 and OHT induce the p38 pathway. To analyze the role of the p38 pathway in E2- or OHT-induced apoptosis, we used human breast cancer cell lines and cell lines selected for resistance to killing by E2 or by OHT. In each of these cell lines, we observed an excellent correlation between the ability to activate the p38 pathway and the ability of E2 or OHT to induce apoptosis. Activation of the p38 signal transduction pathway represents a novel ER-dependent activity of E2 and OHT. All HeLa-derived cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% charcoal-dextran-treated fetal bovine serum (CD-FBS). These cell lines include: HeLa, the HeLa-ER5 and HeLa-ER3 cell lines that were stably transfected to express hERα (9Zhang C.C. Krieg S. Shapiro D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 632-643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); TRHeLa-ER5, which is a HeLa-ER5-derived cell line selected for resistance to killing by OHT, and ERHeLa-ER5 cells, which is a HeLa-ER5-derived cell line selected for resistance to killing by E2. MCF-7 and MCF-10F cells were maintained in MEM supplemented with 5% FBS (containing 10 μg/ml phenol red). Three days before transfection, MCF-7 and MCF-10F cells were transferred to phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium supplemented with 10% CD-FBS, and they remained in this medium until harvesting. pFA-CHOP and pFR-luc were from Stratagene, La Jolla, CA. pRL-SV40 was from Promega, Madison, WI. 4ERE-luc was constructed by Dr. G. de Haan in this laboratory. MKK3(Ala) was a kind gift of Prof. R. Davis, University of Massachusetts, Worcester, MA. HeLa-ER5 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/10% CD-FBS with 10 nmE2 or 10 nm OHT, respectively. Colonies that grew out and were therefore resistant to cell death were isolated and reseeded into 24-well culture plates in selection media. These cell lines, named ERHeLa-ER5 and TRHeLa-ER5, were further expanded to confluence in T-175 flasks. For long term growth, the cells were maintained under selection in medium containing 10 nm E2 or 10 nm OHT, respectively. The cells were treated with the specific p38 inhibitor SB203580 (20Guenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F. Young P.R. Lee J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1973) Google Scholar) or a specific MEK1 inhibitor PD098059 (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) as described in the figure legends. Cell viability was assayed by exclusion of trypan blue. DNA fragmentation assays were performed using the method described by McGahon et al. (21McGahon A.J. Martin S.J. Bissonnette B.P. Mahboubi A.

Annexin V assays were performed using an apoptosis detection kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Briefly, one million cells were plated in T-25 flasks, treated for 12 h with the indicated concentrations of ligands, harvested, washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline, incubated for 15 min with fluorescein-conjugated annexin V and propidium iodide, and analyzed by flow cytometry. Transient transfections of HeLa, HeLa-ER5, HeLa-ER3, TRHeLa-ER5, and ERHeLa-ER5 cells were performed using Tfx™-20 reagent (Promega, Madison, WI), using the manufacturer's protocol. Transient transfections of MCF-7 and MCF-10F cells were performed using Tfx™-50 reagent (Promega). Transfections were done in 12-well plates, containing the indicated amounts of pFA-CHOP, pFR-luc, or 4ERE-luc, MKK3(Ala), 2.5 ng of PRL-SV40 as internal standard, and PTZ18 U (or pcDNA3 if MKK3(Ala) was used) to bring the total amount of DNA to 600 ng in each well. The indicated concentrations of hormone were added immediately after transfection. After 36 or 48 h, the cells were harvested and dual luciferase assays (Promega) were performed using the manufacturer's protocol. 10 μg of nuclear extract containing ER (for determining ER status) or 100 μg of cell lysates (for p38 MAPK assays) was analyzed by electrophoresis on a 12.5% glycine-SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and the proteins were electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was probed with ER-specific primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature (D547, generously provided by Dr. G. Greene, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL) or with antiphospho-p38 overnight at 4 °C, incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (at 1:2000 dilution) and detected by chemiluminescence with an ECL™ kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 24 h after the removal of serum from HeLa-ER5 cells, the cells were incubated in the presence of ethanol (control), 10 nm E2, or 10 nm OHT for the indicated time at 37 °C. After washing with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline twice, the cells were solubilized in 200 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1% deoxycholic acid, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm NaPPi, 50 ng/μl leupeptin, 5 ng/μl phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 ng/μl pepstatin A, and 0.5 ng/μl aprotinin. The cell lysates were centrifuged to remove insoluble material, and 100 μg of the supernatant protein was used in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. p38 MAPK activation was determined by Western blot analysis using antiphospho-p38 MAPK antibody (Thr180/Tyr182), (New England Bioloabs, Beverly, MA). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were carried out as we recently described (9Zhang C.C. Krieg S. Shapiro D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 632-643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We recently described the isolation and characterization of several HeLa cell lines stably transfected to express human ERα (hERα). We found that addition of E2 or OHT to the culture medium blocks the growth of these ER-positive cells (9Zhang C.C. Krieg S. Shapiro D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 632-643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our subsequent studies showed that concentrations of E2 or OHT as low as 10−13m inhibit growth of these cells (data not shown). To examine the effects of E2 or OHT on the growth of HeLa-ER5 cells, we examined the time course of cell growth and of cell death when the cells were maintained in culture medium containing or lacking E2 or OHT, or inhibitors of MAP kinase pathways. E2 or OHT killed virtually all of the cells. The specific inhibitor of the ERK pathway, PD098059, had no effect on cell death mediated by E2 or by OHT. In contrast, the specific inhibitor of the p38 MAP kinase pathway SB203580 partially protected against cell death induced by E2 or by OHT (Fig. 1, A and B). Because we found (Fig. 1 B and data not shown), as have others (19Migliaccio A. Piccolo D. Castoria G. Di Domenico M. Bilancio A. Lombardi M. Gong W. Beato M. Auricchio F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2008-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar), that high concentrations of SB203580 alone also induced cell death, we used a range of concentrations of SB203580. 1 μm SB203580 largely protected the cells against cell death induced by E2 or by OHT for 3 days (Fig. 1,A and B). The effects of lower (0.1 μm) and higher (10 μm) concentrations of SB203580 were different in the cells treated with E2 or OHT, suggesting that there are differences in the induction of cell death by E2 and by OHT. The observation that SB203580 partially protects HeLa-ER5 cells from cell death suggests that the p38 pathway is involved in the E2- or OHT-induced death of the cells. While our data showed that E2 or OHT induced death of the cells, it was unclear whether cell death was due to necrosis, or to apoptosis. To determine whether E2 or OHT induced apoptosis, we treated the HeLa-ER5 cells with either 10−7m E2 or 10−7m OHT. Genomic DNA was isolated from the treated cells and fractionated on an agarose gel. The DNA samples from the E2- or OHT-treated cells both exhibited the DNA laddering pattern, which is widely used as a marker for apoptosis (Fig. 2 A). We also performed cell cycle analyses and found that E2 or OHT treatment resulted in G1/S arrest (data not shown). To more accurately quantitate the fraction of the cells undergoing apoptosis, we used the annexin V assay, which provides a way to determine the proportion of cells in the early stages of apoptosis, and the proportion of cells in the late stages of apoptosis, or undergoing necrosis. We found that treating the cells with E2 or OHT increased the proportion of cells in the early stages of apoptosis by >10-fold. Perhaps because of the extended time of exposure to E2 and OHT, only a fraction of the cells were in the early stages of apoptosis at a given time. Treating the cells with the specific inhibitor of the p38 signaling pathway, SB203580, partially suppressed E2- or OHT-induced cell death (Fig. 2 B). To measure the activity of the p38 signaling pathway, we used a recently developed reporter gene system (Fig. 3 A). This system is based on the fact that activated p38 directly phosphorylates the CHOP activation domain (CHOP-AD), enabling the CHOP-AD to activate transcription (20Guenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F. Young P.R. Lee J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1973) Google Scholar). In this system, the CHOP activation domain is fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain (pFA-CHOP). p38 activity is measured by the ability of the Gal4 DNA binding domain-CHOP-AD to activate transcription of a luciferase reporter gene controlled by a synthetic promoter that contains five copies of the GAL4 DNA binding site (pFR-luc). We evaluated the level of CHOP activity in response to E2 and OHT, and the pure antiestrogen ICI 182, 780. E2 strongly induced CHOP activity (Fig. 3 B), while OHT elicited a much smaller induction. The pure antiestrogen ICI 182,780 did not induce CHOP activity, and usually suppressed basal CHOP activity (Fig. 3 B, and data not shown). This suggests that part of the basal activity of CHOP in the HeLa-ER5 cells may be due to the presence of traces of estrogen in the medium. The -fold induction of CHOP activity by E2 and by OHT may therefore be somewhat greater than what we report using no added ligand as our base line. The inability of ICI 182,780 to induce CHOP activity is consistent with our previous observation that ICI 182,780 does not induce death of HeLa-ER cells, and actually stimulates their growth (9Zhang C.C. Krieg S. Shapiro D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 632-643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Evidence that the reporter gene system measures p38 activity in the HeLa-ER5 cells is shown by the ability of the p38 pathway inhibitor SB203580 to block induction of luciferase activity by E2 or by OHT. 1 μm SB203580 largely blocked the induction of CHOP activity, and 10 μm SB203580 completely blocked the induction (Fig. 3 B). To analyze the effect of E2 and OHT on p38 activity in more detail, we carried out a series of cotransfections. To determine if the induction of p38 activity by E2 or by OHT requires ER, we performed transfections using pFA-CHOP and pFR-luc in HeLa cells, which are ER-negative, and are not killed by E2 or OHT (9Zhang C.C. Krieg S. Shapiro D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 632-643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Neither E2 nor OHT induced p38 activity in the ER-negative HeLa cells, indicating that ER is required for induction of p38 by E2 and by OHT (Fig. 3 C, HeLa). We then carried out a series of transfections in HeLa-ER5 cells using increasing amounts of pFA-CHOP transactivator and a fixed concentration of the pFR-luc reporter plasmid. E2 and OHT each elicited a CHOP-dependent increase in reporter gene activity. At 1.25 ng of CHOP transactivator, 10 nm E2 induced a 36-fold increase in luciferase activity and 10 nm OHT induced a 5-fold increase in activity (Fig. 3 C). Since there is no induction of p38 in HeLa cells, which are not killed by E2 or by OHT, and ICI 182,780, which does not kill the ER-positive HeLa-ER5 cells, does not induce p38, the stimulation of p38 activity by E2 and by OHT is correlated with apoptosis induced by these ligands. However, OHT, which induces apoptosis at least as well as E2, is much less effective in inducing p38 activity. To be certain that the induction of p38 activity by E2 and by OHT was not due to a unique property of the HeLa-ER5 cell line, we carried out similar experiments in a second ER-positive HeLa cell line, HeLa-ER3, which expresses less ER (9Zhang C.C. Krieg S. Shapiro D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 632-643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The induction of p38 activity by E2 or by OHT was similar in the HeLa-ER5 and HeLa-ER3 cells (see Table I below).Table IInduction of p38 activity and apoptosis is linked in ER-positive cell linesCell linep38 activityApoptosisTransactivation (E2)E2OHTE2OHTHeLa-ER5++++++++++++++++++HeLa-ER3++++++++++++++++++TRHeLa-ER5++++−++++−++++ERHeLa-ER5−++−++++−MCF-7−+−+++++++HeLa−−−−− Open table in a new tab These studies of the activity of the p38 pathway employed a transactivation assay that is dependent on phosphorylation of the p38 MAP kinase target, CHOP. Since this is a relatively new assay, and the subcellular site of CHOP phosphorylation is not precisely defined, we also carried out Western blot analysis with an antibody that directly recognizes phosphorylated p38 MAP kinase. Phospho-p38 was undetectable at time 0 and was clearly induced by both E2 and OHT at 4 h, with the induction persisting for at least 8 h. Consistent with the data obtained using the CHOP phosphorylation assay, E2 was a much stronger inducer of p38 activity than OHT (Fig. 3 D). Since Western blot analysis with antibodies to p38 MAP kinase indicated that levels of p38 MAP kinase were unchanged from 0–16 h in cells treated with E2 or with OHT (data not shown), the induction of phospho-p38 by E2 and by OHT was not due to an increase in the level of p38 MAP kinase. Activation of MKK3 and related proteins is often the first committed step in the p38 pathway (24Derijard B. Raingeaud J. Barrett T. Wu I.H. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar). Cotransfection of HeLa cells with the dominant negative mutant MKK3(Ala) and the pFR-luc and pFA-CHOP reporter system decreased basal p38 activity approximately 2-fold (Fig. 4 A). In contrast, cotransfection of the dominant negative MKK3(Ala) with pFR-luc and pFA-CHOP into HeLa-ER5 cells did not affect the ability of E2 or OHT to induce p38 (Fig. 4 B). Since MKK3(Ala) only suppressed p38 activity 2-fold in the ER-negative HeLa cells, and p38 activation by E2 and by OHT may involve other members of the MKK family, MKK4 and MKK6 (25Han J. Lee J.D. Jiang Y. Li Z. Feng L. Ulevitch R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2886-2891Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar), a role for these MKK proteins in activation of p38 by E2 or by OHT remains to be established. To further analyze the induction of apoptosis by OHT and by E2, we isolated HeLa-ER5 cell lines resistant to killing by OHT or by E2, and analyzed the properties of their ERs and their ability to induce the p38 pathway and apoptosis. OHT has lost the ability to induce apoptosis (data not shown), in the cell line selected for resistance to killing by OHT (designated TRHeLa-ER5, and referred to asTR in Fig. 5). We analyzed the ability of OHT and of E2 to induce p38 and the affect of MKK3(Ala) in the TRHeLa-ER5 cells (Fig. 5 A, TR, left panel). OHT completely lost the ability to induce p38 in the TRHeLa-ER5 cells. When OHT was present, p38 activity in the TRHeLa-ER5 cells was at the same basal level as in the absence of ligand, and was reduced about 2-fold at 50 ng of cotransfected MKK3(Ala) (Fig. 5 A, TR,left panel). However, E2 retained full ability to induce p38 activity in the TRHeLa-ER5 cells and the induction was not blocked by MKK3(Ala) (Fig. 5 A,TR, left panel). E2 also retained full ability to induce apoptosis in the TRHeLa-ER5 cells (data not shown). The cell line selected for resistance to killing by E2 was designated ERHeLa-ER5, and is referred to asER in Fig. 5. In these cells E2 has lost the ability to induce the p38 pathway (Fig. 5 A,ER, left panel) and to induce apoptosis (data not shown). In the ERHeLa-ER5 cell line, OHT retains the ability to induce both the p38 pathway (Fig. 5 A, ER, left panel) and apoptosis (data not shown). To determine whether resistance to E2 or OHT was based on altered transactivation by ER, we analyzed the ability of the ER in these cell lines to activate transcription of a transfected estrogen response element (ERE)-containing reporter gene. The ER in the TRHeLa-ER5 cells retained the ability to activate the ERE-containing reporter gene, while the ER in the ERHeLa-ER5 cells completely lost the ability to activate transcription of the ERE-containing reporter gene (Fig. 5 A,right panel, ER). Since it was possible that expression of ER protein was lost in the ERHeLa-ER5 cells, we carried out Western blot analysis on extracts from the TRHeLa-ER5 and the ERHeLa-ER5 cells. Levels of ER expression were similar in the two cell lines (Fig. 5 B), indicating that the loss of ability to transactivate the ERE-containing reporter gene was not due to the loss of ER in the ERHeLa-ER5 cells. To further analyze the functional activity of the ER in the TRHeLa-ER5 and the ERHeLa-ER5 cells, we prepared nuclear extracts from the two cell lines and examined the ability of the ER in the extracts to bind to a labeled ERE in anin vitro electrophoretic mobility shift assay (Fig. 5 C). Consistent with its ability to transactivate an ERE-containing reporter gene in vivo, the ER in nuclear extracts from the TRHeLa-ER5 cells exhibited concentration-dependent binding to the ERE (Fig. 5 C, TR NE). While the Western blot (Fig. 5 B) showed that the ER is present in ERHeLa-ER5 cells, it had lost the ability to bind to the ERE (Fig. 5 C, ER NE). The inability of the ER in the ERHeLa-ER5 cells to bind to the ERE makes it impossible for the ER in these cells to activate transcription of the ERE-containing reporter gene. These data demonstrate a linkage between the ability of E2or OHT to induce apoptosis and their ability to induce the p38 pathway. The data also suggest that the there are significant differences in the induction of apoptosis by OHT and by E2. Although the p38 pathway was not examined, differences in apoptosis induced by OHT and by E2 were also found in a study of apoptosis in human mammary epithelial cells stably transfected to express ER (26Zajchowski D.A. Wester L. Humm R. White III, F.A. Simmons S.J. Bartholdi M. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 62: 373-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). MCF-7 human breast cancer cells have been widely used as a model for estrogen-dependent growth of breast cancer cells. E2 stimulates the growth of MCF-7 cells and does not induce apoptosis (27Dauvois S. White R. Parker M.J. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 1377-1388Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, transient transfections with the CHOP reporter system show that E2fails to induce p38 activity in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 6). In contrast, in MCF-7 cells, OHT induces both p38 activity (Fig. 6 A) and apoptosis (Fig. 6 B). Consistent with the data from HeLa cells, OHT does not induce p38 in an ER-negative human mammary epithelial cell line, MCF-10F (Fig. 6 A, MCF-10F), indicating that ER is required for the OHT induction of p38 activity. Because of their large size and autofluorescence, quantitation of apoptosis in MCF-7 cells can be difficult. Using the annexin V assay system, we find that SB203580 largely protects MCF-7 cells from OHT-induced apoptosis (Fig. 6 B). While the ability of ER to activate transcription of nuclear genes has received the most attention, recent studies indicate that in some cell contexts E2 can activate an ERK kinase signaling pathway (15Watters J.J. Campbell J.S. Cunningham M.J. Krebs E.G. Dorsa D.M. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4030-4033Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 16Endoh H. Sasaki H. Maruyama K. Takeyama K. Waga I. Shimizu T.

Beato M. Auricchio F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2008-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Under our conditions, addition of E2 to the HeLa-ER culture medium resulted in a robust induction of the p38 signaling pathway, while OHT addition resulted in a much smaller, but readily detectable, induction of p38 activity. We observed induction of the p38 pathway both with a reporter gene assay based on p38 phosphorylation of the CHOP activation domain (Fig. 3, B and C), and by direct detection of phospho-p38 by Western blot analysis. Although precise quantitation is difficult with the Western blot assay for phospho-p38, E2 clearly induces a much higher level of phospho-p38 than OHT (Fig. 3 D). The specific inhibitor of the p38 pathway, SB203580, blocked the induction, providing additional evidence that E2 and OHT induce p38 activity. These data provide the first evidence that estrogens or antiestrogens activate the p38 signaling pathway. In many contexts, activation of JNKs parallels activation of p38. Our preliminary data indicate that E2and OHT also induce JNK (data not shown). In contrast to the p38 pathway, a specific inhibitor of the JNK pathway was not available to us, preventing us from directly linking activation of the JNK pathway to induction of apoptosis by E2 and by OHT. We therefore focused our studies on the p38 signaling pathway. The close correlation between the induction of apoptosis by E2 and by OHT, and the ability to induce p38, enabled us to select cell lines resistant to apoptosis, which clearly distinguish the different effects of E2 and OHT on p38 activity. To simplify comparisons between the several cell lines we used, the properties of the cell lines we analyzed are summarized in Table I. In the ERHeLa-ER5 cell line, E2 has lost the ability to induce p38 and apoptosis. The ER in ERHeLa-ER5 cells has also lost the ability to bind to the ERE in vitro and does not transactivate an ERE-containing reporter gene in the presence of E2. Since OHT retains the ability to induce the p38 pathway in these ERHeLa-ER5 cells, whose ER is non-functional for ERE binding and E2-dependent transactivation, ERE-dependent genomic effects of the OHT-ER complex are probably not important in the induction of p38 by OHT-ER. Additional evidence for distinct mechanisms of p38 induction by E2 and by OHT comes from the TRHeLa-ER5 cells. In these cells, OHT has lost the ability to induce p38 and apoptosis, but the ER remains competent for ERE binding and E2-dependent transactivation, and for induction of p38 and apoptosis. The molecular basis for these intriguing differences in the interactions of OHT-ER and E2-ER with the p38 pathway is not yet known. The inability of the ER in the ERHeLa-ER5 cells to bind to the ERE raises interesting questions related to the activation of p38 by E2-ER. Although the x-ray structure of full-length ER has not yet been reported, the ER ligand binding domain (28Kraus W.L. McInerney E.M. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12314-12318Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and DNA binding domain (9Zhang C.C. Krieg S. Shapiro D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 632-643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) can influence the structure of the AF2 activation domain in the ER hormone binding domain, and thereby alter the interaction of ER with coregulators. Mutations in the DNA binding domain and altered interaction of ER with the ERE could therefore potentially affect the ability of ER to activate the p38 pathway, either through direct protein-protein interactions with the ER DNA binding domain or with other parts of the ER, or indirectly through altered ability of the ER to act at the DNA level. It has been proposed that tamoxifen can exert a variety of effects in breast cancer cells that lack ER (11Perry R.R. Kang Y. Greaves B. Ann. Surg. Oncol. 1995; 2: 238-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 13Fattman C.L. An B. Sussman L. Dou Q.P. Cancer Lett. 1998; 130: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Here we showed that in ER-negative HeLa cells and MCF-10F cells, OHT does not induce the p38 pathway (Figs. 3 C and 6 A). These data indicate that while OHT induction of p38 activity does not require that the ER be competent for ERE-dependent transactivation, intracellular ER must be present. While OHT elicits a lower level of activation of P38 than E2, this activation is unlikely to be based on the weak agonist activity of tamoxifen, as ER binding to ERE-containing genes is unrelated to OHT induction of P38. The inability of ICI 182,780 to activate the p38 pathway may arise from the ability of this class of pure antagonists to interfere with cytoplasmic-nuclear shuttling of ER and to induce the rapid degradation of ER (27Dauvois S. White R. Parker M.J. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 1377-1388Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Dauvois S. Danielian P.S. White R. Parker M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4037-4041Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Several types of data, which are summarized in Table I, indicate that the induction of p38 activity by E2 and by OHT is strongly coupled to their ability to induce apoptosis. (i) In HeLa-ER5 cells, E2 and OHT each induce p38 and each induce apoptosis. The specific inhibitor of the p38 signaling pathway, SB203580, abolishes induction of p38 by E2 and by OHT and greatly reduces their ability to induce apoptosis. (ii) In three different cell lines, ERHeLa-ER5, TRHeLa-ER5, and MCF-7, the ER ligand that retains the ability to induce the p38 pathway also retains the ability to induce apoptosis, and the ER ligand that has lost the ability to induce p38 loses the ability to induce apoptosis. The concentration of SB203580 most effective in blocking apoptosis was different for OHT and for E2 (Fig. 1, 1 μmand 10 μm, respectively), suggesting that other pathways may also play a role in E2 and OHT-induced apoptosis. Our observation that OHT is at least as effective an inducer of apoptosis as E2 suggests that there is not a strict one-to-one relationship between the extent of p38 induction and the ability of an ER ligand to induce apoptosis. It is widely accepted that cell transformation can be achieved either by enhanced levels or activities of proteins which allow cells to transit the cell cycle (such as mitogens and cytokines), or by reduced levels or activities of proteins, such as p53, which serve as cell cycle checkpoints and inducers of apoptosis (30Aitken S.C. Lippman M.E. Kasid A. Schoenberg D.R. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 2608-2615PubMed Google Scholar, 31Innocente S.A. Abrahamson J.L. Cogswell J.P. Lee J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Mutations leading to inactivation of the p53 tumor suppresser are the most common mutations in human cancers (30Aitken S.C. Lippman M.E. Kasid A. Schoenberg D.R. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 2608-2615PubMed Google Scholar). The recent report that activation of p38 stimulates phosphorylation and activation of p53 (5Huang C. Ma W.-Y. Maxiner A. Sun Y. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12229-12235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) provides another potential site for growth control in breast cancer cells. Several recent studies (3Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5028) Google Scholar, 33Lavoie J.N. L'Allemain G. Brunet A. Muller R. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20608-20616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar) have proposed that the balance of activities between the ERK mitogen-activated signaling pathway and the stress-activated p38 pathway may be an important factor in the decision of cells to proliferate, remain quiescent, or undergo apoptosis. Consistent with this hypothesis is our finding that in MCF-7 cells, in which E2 stimulates cell growth, E2 does not induce p38. Most studies of tamoxifen, and of other antiestrogens, have centered on their ability to compete with estrogens for binding to the ER, and thereby antagonize the ability of estrogens to induce the conformational change in the ER, which makes it competent to activate transcription. Several recent studies have described additional activities of tamoxifen, including the ability to induce antioxidant enzymes (34Montano M.M. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2581-2586Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and apoptosis (10Coradini D. Biffi A. Cappelletti V. Di Fronzo G. Anticancer Res. 1994; 14: 1059-1064PubMed Google Scholar, 11Perry R.R. Kang Y. Greaves B. Ann. Surg. Oncol. 1995; 2: 238-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 12Chen H. Tritton T.R.

Cancer Lett. 1998; 130: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It was known that tamoxifen could induce apoptosis in some cells, and clinical applications of tamoxifen in breast cancer therapy often result in tumor regression (35Jordan V.C. Lababidi M.K. Langan-Fahey S. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1991; 83: 492-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). However, there was no biological pathway or system associated with this action of tamoxifen, and it was suggested that this activity of tamoxifen might not require ER (11Perry R.R. Kang Y. Greaves B. Ann. Surg. Oncol. 1995; 2: 238-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In this work we demonstrate that, in the presence of ER, the active metabolite of tamoxifen, 4-hydroxytamoxifen, induces the p38 pathway and apoptosis. The close coupling of apoptosis with induction of p38 activity suggests that it may be possible to carry out preliminary screening of large numbers of putative antiestrogens and selective estrogen receptor modulators using the induction of p38 activity as a surrogate marker for the ability to induce apoptosis. This screen would be based on the ability of antiestrogens to increase luciferase activity using endogenous and stably transfected ER-positive cell lines, and the easily automated, luciferase-based, CHOP reporter gene system we used.

https://openalex.org/W2034250322,"Constitutive activation of the Met tyrosine kinase results in transformation of cells of diverse origin. Recent studies have demonstrated a role for the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) in Met-induced transformation, but little is known about the molecular mechanisms that connect Met to JNK activation. Our studies show that activated Met associates with, and phosphorylates, the docking protein Gab1, which in turn binds to the src homology 2 (SH2)-domain of the adapter protein Crk and recruits Crk to the Met signaling complex. Formation of the Gab1 - Crk complex correlates with Met-induced JNK activation, and mutant forms of Met that fail to induce the complex formation also fail to activate JNK. Importantly, expression of a loss-of-function mutant of Crk severely impairs activation of the JNK pathway by Met. We also show here that Met controls the transcription of the matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) gene in carcinoma cells and that this transcriptional regulation occurs in a Crk - JNK-dependent manner through an AP-1 element in the MMP-1 promoter. Taken together, our data implicate the Gab1 - Crk signaling complex in Met-induced JNK activation and suggest that the Gab1 - Crk complex formation may be an important event in regulating the tumorigenic phenotype of Met-transformed cells."
https://openalex.org/W2332011590,"We have identified a novel cytoskeletal protein, EPLIN (Epithelial Protein Lost In Neoplasm), that is preferentially expressed in human epithelial cells. Two EPLIN isoforms, a 600 amino acid EPLIN-alpha and a 759 amino acid EPLIN-beta, are detected in primary epithelial cells of oral mucosa, prostate and mammary glands. The expression of EPLIN-alpha is either down-regulated or lost in the majority of oral cancer cell lines (8/8), prostate cancer cell lines (4/4) and xenograft tumors (3/3), and breast cancer cell lines (5/6). The amino acid sequence of EPLIN is characterized by the presence of a single centrally located LIM domain. Both EPLIN isoforms localize to filamentous actin and suppress cell proliferation when overexpressed. These findings indicate that the loss of EPLIN seen in cancer cells may play a role in cancer progression."

TN-C is re-expressed during wound healing, fibrotic diseases and in cancer. To better understand the mechanisms that control TN-C gene expression, we examined the regulation of the human TN-C promoter in human fibroblasts. We demonstrate that a short segment of the TN-C promoter between bp -133 and -27 contains three evolutionarily conserved Ets binding sites (EBS). These three EBSs bind in vitro expressed Fli1 protein and mediate transactivation of the TN-C gene by Fli1. Furthermore, two proximal EBSs contribute significantly to basal activity of the TN-C promoter. GABP, which is present in human fibroblast nuclear extracts, interacts with the two proximal EBSs. In addition, several Sp1 and Sp3 binding sites have been located in close proximity to the EBSs within this promoter region. The studies performed in Drosophila cells demonstrate that either Fli1 or GABPalpha+beta1 functionally interact with Sp1 resulting in a synergistic stimulation of the TN-C promoter activity. In conclusion, this study shows for the first time that the TN-C gene is regulated by Ets proteins, which together with Sp1 act as potent activators of TN-C expression."
https://openalex.org/W1899532222,"Activation of muscle contraction is a rapid event that is initiated by electrical activity in the surface membrane and transverse (T) tubules. This is followed by release of calcium from the inner membrane system, the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Using electron microscopy (EM), K. R. Porter and his laboratory defined the SR, the unique junctions between SR and T tubules, and the continuity between T tubules and surface membrane. Current research in this area centers on the interaction between T tubules and SR. This is mediated by 2 well-identified calcium channels: the dihydropyridine receptors (DHPRs) that act as voltage sensors in the T tubules, and the ryanodine receptors (RyRs) or calcium release channels of the SR. The relative positions of these 2 molecules differ significantly in skeletal and cardiac muscle, and this correlates well with known functional differences in the control of contraction. Molecular biology experiments combined with EM indicate that DHPRs are linked to RyRs in skeletal but probably not in cardiac muscle.—Franzini-Armstrong, C.

By contrast, none of these CpG dinucleotides were methylated in the livers from the rats bearing the tumor, which was consistent with the efficient induction of the gene in this tissue by zinc sulfate. Genomic footprinting revealed lack of access of the transcriptional activators to the respective cis-acting elements of the methylatedMT-I promoter in the hepatoma. The absence of footprinting was not due to inactivation of the metal regulatory transcription factor MTF-1, because it was highly active in the hepatoma.

This DNA modification has evolved as an epigenetic mechanism in vertebrates, plants, and fungi but not in yeast, flies, and nematodes. Although CpG dinucleotides are present within the coding region, clusters of this sequence known as CpG islands occur frequently in the promoter regions of some genes. The CpG regions are usually devoid of methylation, but in some cancer cells, these sites appear to be susceptible to methylation. In normal cells, only a few genes on the inactive X chromosome and foreign DNA,e.g. transposable elements and provirus are silenced by this mechanism (4Li E. Beard C. Forster A.C. Bestor T.H.

On the contrary, the promoters of some tumor suppressor genes are methylated, resulting in their inactivation (1Baylin S.B. Herman J.G. Graff J.R. Vertino P.M. Issa J.P. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 72: 141-196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutation in the coding region of the tumor suppressor genes has been generally considered the major mechanism of inactivation of the tumor suppressor genes. Recently, aberrant DNA methylation of the CpG islands in the promoter region has emerged as an alternative mechanism for the silencing of these growth regulatory genes and may be one of the earliest events in the neoplastic transformation of cells (10Toyota M.

In recent years, there has been growing interest in the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms by which DNA methylation represses gene expression. Recent studies have identified two repressor proteins, MeCP1 and MeCP2, that bind specifically to methyl-CpG without apparent sequence specificity and repress methylated promoter activity in vitro as well as in vivo (17Meehan R.R.

Methylated genes can be transcribed efficiently in vitro in the absence of MeCPs.

The constitutive levels of MT-I and MT-II in most tissues are negligible but can be induced rather dramatically by a variety of agents that include heavy toxic metals, UV radiation, restraint stress, and agents that produce reactive oxygen species (for a review see Refs. 27Kagi J.A.

The latter studies indicate a protective role for metallothionein against cellular damage and prompted us to explore the molecular mechanisms for MT expression. Although heavy metals or other inducers up-regulate the expression ofMT-I and MT-II genes in most tissues or cells in culture, there are a few exceptions. For example, none of these genes are induced in the lymphoid-derived tumor cells W7 and S49 by agents like heavy metals, glucocorticoids, etc. (36Compere S.J. Palmiter R.D. Cell. 1981; 25: 233-240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism(s) for the suppression of MT induction in these cells has not been elucidated. Further, the status of MT expression in the parental cells (e.g. thymus) has not been explored. It is also unknown whether repression of MT induction is unique to cancer cells of lymphoid origin and whether such repression is observed in solid tumors growing in animals, which are the prevalent forms of human cancer. The present study was undertaken to test this possibility. For this purpose, we studied the expression of MT-I in a rat hepatoma in response to heavy metals and compared it with that in the liver of the tumor-bearing rats. The data show that the hepatoma is incapable of expressing MT-I following treatment of the hepatoma-bearing rats with CdSO4 or ZnSO4, whereas it is induced in the host liver. Further, this investigation has elucidated the mechanism for the repression of MT gene expression in the tumor. Morris hepatoma 3924A is a poorly differentiated, rapidly growing tumor with a mean doubling time of 4–5 days (37Duceman B.W. Rose K.M. Jacob S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 10755-10758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is grown by transplanting a thin slice (0.5 × 2–3 mm) of the solid tumor with a trocher in the hind leg of rats (ACI strain). The tumor on each leg grows to 15–20 g within 4–5 weeks. Most experiments were performed when the tumors attained this size. For heavy metal treatment, the tumor-bearing rats were injected intraperitoneally with ZnSO4 (200 μmol/kg body weight), CdSO4 (15 μmol/kg body weight), or the same volume of physiological saline. After 4 h, the animals were sacrificed, a fraction of the liver, and the hepatoma were frozen in liquid N2 for RNA isolation, and the remaining tissues were processed for the isolation of nuclei. For 5-AzaC treatment, rats bearing the hepatoma were injected intraperitoneally on alternate day with the drug intraperitoneally (5 mg/kg body weight) dissolved in physiological saline or with saline alone (control) after 18 days of tumor pass (when tumor growth was obvious). After 2 weeks of treatment the rats were injected intraperitoneally with either ZnSO4 (200 μmol/kg) or saline and sacrificed after 4 h to isolate the liver and hepatoma DNA and RNA. Saline injected animals were used as control. No visible adverse effect of the drug on the animals was observe during this period of treatment, but the tumor growth was inhibited significantly. Total RNA was isolated from the liver and the hepatoma by guanidinium thiocyanate-acid phenol method (38Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar). 30 μg of RNA was separated by formaldehyde-agarose (1.2%) gel electrophoresis and transferred to nylon membrane. The membrane was then hybridized to mouse random-primed, [α-32P]dCTP-labeled MT-I minigene (39Glanville N. Durnam D.M. Palmiter R.D.

The liver and the hepatoma nuclei were isolated by homogenization in high density sucrose buffer following the protocol of Gorski et al. (42Gorski K. Carneiro M. Schibler U. Cell. 1986; 47: 767-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar) and Rose et al. (43Rose K.M. Stetler D.A. Jacob S.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The nuclei were then used for in vivofootprinting to make nuclear extract for assay of DNA-binding proteins and for DNA-MTase assay. The DNA-binding proteins were extracted with high salt (0.3m KCl) from the isolated nuclei following the protocol of Wadzinski et al. (44Wadzinski B.E. Wheat W.H. Jaspers S. Peruski Jr., L.F.

Protein in the extract was estimated according to Bradford's method with bovine serum albumin as standard using Bio-Rad reagent. The DNA binding activities of MTF-1 and Sp 1 were measured by EMSA using specific oligonucleotide probes and 10 μg of the extract. These reagents were incubated with 0.1–0.5 ng of the32P-labeled MRE-d oligo in the buffer containing 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 60 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) (23Ghoshal K.

For competition, the extract was preincubated with 100-fold molar excess of the unlabeled competitor oligonucleotides (Sp 1, MRE-s) for 15 min on ice before addition of the labeled oligo. The reaction mixture was incubated on ice for 30 min, and the DNA-protein complexes were resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (4% acrylamide; acrylamide:bisacrylamide = 38.7:1.3) in 0.25 × TBE running buffer. For antibody supershift assay, the reaction mixture at the end of the reaction was incubated with 1 μl of anti-MTF-1 antisera, a generous gift from Dr. Walter Schaffner, or antibodies against p70 subunit of Ku protein (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The sequences of the upper strand of the deoxyoligonucleotides used in the synthesis of probe for EMSA are as follows: (a) MRE-d oligo (for Sp 1 and MTF-1) 5′-GATCCAGGGAGCTCTGCACTCCGCCCGAAAAGTA-3′; (b) MRE-s oligo (for MTF-1) 5′-GATCCAGGGAGCTCTGCACaCgGCCCGAAAAGTA-3′ (the letters in lowercase denote the mutations that abolished Sp 1 binding); and (c) Sp 1 5′-ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC-3′. Nuclei were isolated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation of both hepatoma and liver from the hepatoma bearing rats as described in the earlier section. In vivo methylation of nuclear DNA by dimethyl sulfate and the subsequent DNA preparation were performed following the protocol of Bossard et al. (46Bossard P. McPherson C.E. Zaret K.S. Methods. 1997; 11: 180-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). For the preparation of control genomic G ladder, DNA was isolated from both liver and hepatoma nuclei followed by dimethyl sulfate treatment. Ligation-mediated PCR was carried out according to the procedure of Mueller and Wold (47Mueller P.R. Wold B. Science. 1989; 246: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar), with modifications as described by Ping et al. (48Ping D. Jones P.L. Boss J.M. Immunity. 1996; 4: 455-469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The MRE elements and MLTF/ARE site were analyzed using one set of upper strand and one set of lower strand specific primers. Sequences of the primers used to read the lower and the upper strand, and the conditions for LM-PCR are described by Majumder et al. (49Majumder S. Ghoshal K. Li Z. Jacob S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28584-28589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA from the hepatoma and the liver from rats bearing Morris hepatoma 3924A was isolated. DNA (5 μg) was denatured in 0.3 mNaOH for 30 min at 37 °C in 10 μl of volume, mixed with 100 μl of 2 m sodium metabisulphite (Sigma) containing 0.5 mm hydroquinone (pH 5.0) and cycled in a thermal cycler at 50 °C for 30 min and 95 °C for 2 min for 20 cycles. The bisulfite-treated DNA was then desalted using Wizard DNA Clean-up Kit (Promega) and eluted in 100 μl of H2O. The DNA was then desulfonated in the presence of 0.3 m NaOH at 37 °C for 30 min. The solution was neutralized by addition of NaOAc (pH 4.5) to 0.2 m (final concentration). The bisulfite-converted DNA was then desalted again as stated before and eluted in 70 μl of H2O, and an aliquot (0.5–1 μl) was used for each PCR amplification. The metallothionein promoter from −304 to +148 bp was amplified using two sets of primers from the bisulfite-treated liver and hepatoma DNA. The PCR protocol used is as follows: 50 μl of reaction mixture contains 200 μm dNTPs, 2 μm primers, 2 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.). Hot start amplification was performed in a Perkin-Elmer Thermal Cycler under the following conditions: 94 °C/2 min × 1 cycle, 94 °C/2 min, 60 °C/1 min, 72 °C/2 min × 35 cycles; and 72 °C/10 min × 1 cycle. To avoid any nonspecific amplification, product from the first round of PCR was then subjected to amplification with a set of nested primers under the same PCR condition, with the exception that the annealing temperature was maintained at 59 °C. Sequences of the nested primers used to amplify the upper strand of rat MT-Ipromoter from the bisulfite-treated DNA and the annealing temperatures are described earlier (49Majumder S. Ghoshal K. Li Z. Jacob S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28584-28589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To test the efficiency of bisulfite reaction, the amplified DNA (452 bp) was first digested with the restriction enzymes ApoI (R↓ AATT↑Y) orTsp509I (↓AATT↑) that can cut only the converted DNA but not the unconverted DNA. The restriction sites for these two enzymes are generated only when C residues are converted to T residues. The efficiency of bisulfite conversion was confirmed by complete restriction cut of the amplified DNA with Tsp509I orApoI. Amplified DNA was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, followed by cleaning the eluted DNA using Wizard DNA Clean-up kit. The PCR product was directly sequenced using fmol sequencing kit (Promega) with the S2 and A2 primers (49Majumder S. Ghoshal K. Li Z. Jacob S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28584-28589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The nuclei isolated from rat liver and hepatoma tissue were resuspended in 5 volumes of the following buffer: 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.8), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.01% sodium azide, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% glycerol, 1% Tween 80 and lysed as described by Fiala et al. (50Fiala E.S. Staretz M.E. Pandya G.A. El-Bayoumy K. Hamilton S.R. Carcinogenesis. 1998; 19: 597-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Briefly, the method consists of passing the nuclear suspension through a 25 gauge needle, freezing on dry ice, and subsequent thawing at 37 °C, with the freeze-thaw cycle repeated three times. The suspension was centrifuged at 800 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The protein content was determined using Bio-Rad Protein Assay reagent with bovine serum albumin as the standard. The activity of DNA-MTase was determined essentially as described by Tollefsbol and Hutchison (51Tollefsbol T.O. Hutchison C.A.r. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 494-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To compare the inducibility of MT-I in response to heavy metals in the liver and the hepatoma, the hepatoma-bearing rats were injected with zinc and cadmium salts, and MT-I mRNA level was measured 4 h post injection. Unexpectedly, the tumor was not responsive to either of the metals, whereas the liver expressed MT-I under these conditions (Fig. 1, compare lanes 1–3 withlanes 4–6, respectively). There was no detectable MT-I mRNA induction in the hepatoma even after 8 h and 24 h of zinc and cadmium treatment, respectively (data not shown). The MT-I induction in the liver was 10- and 20-fold after zinc and cadmium treatment, respectively. The reason for the relatively smaller extent of MT induction in this study is probably due to the higher basal level of MT mRNA in the host liver of the tumor bearing animals relative to the livers of normal ones (52Kloth D.M. Chin J.L. Cherian M.G. Br. J. Cancer. 1995; 71: 712-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). 2K. Ghoshal, unpublished data. The higher basal level of MT-I mRNA in the livers of tumor-bearing rats appears to result from stress caused by the tumor burden. This observation is consistent with the dramatic induction of MT in the livers of normal rats exposed to simple stress (23Ghoshal K. Wang Y. Sheridan J.F. Jacob S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27904-27910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). MT-II mRNA in the hepatoma also remained unaltered after heavy metal treatment (data not shown). BecauseMT-I and MT-II are coordinately induced in all tissues in response to heavy metals, it is not surprising that both these isoforms are not expressed in the hepatoma. Because the hepatoma contains a relatively higher level of GAPDH mRNA, 18 S ribosomal RNA profile in ethidium bromide-stained gel was compared with ascertain equal RNA loading. This experiment was repeated with several different tumor bearing rats, and the results were comparable. As a first step toward the elucidation of the mechanism of noninducibility of MT-I gene in the hepatoma, we measured the DNA binding activity of transacting factors by EMSA. The cis-acting elements and a fewtrans-acting factors that regulate MT gene expression are known. There are several copies (a–f) of metal regulatory element (MRE) that span the upstream promoter of mouse MT-I gene (28Palmiter R.D. Experientia. 1987; 52 (suppl.): 63-80Google Scholar, 29Thiele D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1183-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). In addition to MREs, the MT-I promoter also contains the binding sites for Sp 1 and MLTF/USF (53Hamer D.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 913-951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 54Datta P.K. Jacob S.T. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1993; 39: 439-449PubMed Google Scholar). MTF-1, a 69–86-kDa protein containing six zinc fingers, binds to the MREs in response to heavy metals and activates the genes (45Radtke F. Heuchel R. Georgiev O. Hergersberg M. Gariglio M. Dembic Z.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2277-2286Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). This transcription factor is necessary for the basal and inducible expression of MT genes by heavy metals and oxygen free radicals (56Dalton T.P. Li Q. Bittel D. Liang L. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26233-26241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar,57Cagatay G. Heuchel R. Georgiev O. Lichtlen P. Bluthmann H. Marino S. Aguzzi A. Scaffner W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2846-2854Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). EMSA was used to measure the DNA binding activity of MTF-1 in the liver and the hepatoma nuclear extracts. MRE-d was the oligo of choice in this assay, because MTF-1 exhibited strongest binding affinity for this MRE in vitro (45Radtke F. Heuchel R. Georgiev O. Hergersberg M. Gariglio M. Dembic Z. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1355-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 55Heuchel R. Radtke F. Georgiev O. Stark G. Aguet M. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2805-2870Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Because MRE-d has binding sites for both MTF-1 and Sp 1, two DNA-protein complexes were detected in the liver and hepatoma nuclear extracts (Fig. 2 A, lanes 1 and4). To identify the complexes, competitive EMSA was performed with 100-fold molar excess of Sp 1 consensus oligo and MRE-s oligo, a variant of MRE-d in which Sp 1 site is mutated to abolish its binding (45Radtke F. Heuchel R. Georgiev O. Hergersberg M. Gariglio M. Dembic Z. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1355-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The lower complex in both tissues was competed out with MRE-s oligo (lanes 2 and 5), and the upper complex disappeared with Sp 1 oligo (lanes 3 and6). Because identical amounts of the protein were used in this assay, these data clearly show that both MTF-1 and Sp 1 are more active in the hepatoma than the host liver. The DNA binding activities of MTF-1 and Sp 1 were analyzed with several nuclear extracts prepared from different batches of hepatomas, and the results were reproducible. We also tested whether MTF-1 was activated in the hepatoma in response to zinc. For this purpose we made hepatoma nuclear extract from the animals injected intraperitoneal with ZnSO4 (200 μmol/g) for 4 h and measured the MRE-d binding activity (Fig. 2 B). The complexes formed are specific because their formation could be competed out with an excess of unlabeled MRE-d oligo (lane 3). The slower migrating complex was Sp 1, because its formation was competed by unlabeled Sp 1 consensus oligo (lane 4), and the faster migrating complex was MTF-1, because it could be supershifted with antisera against N-terminal fragment of the protein lackin"
https://openalex.org/W2334731906,"The HPV-16 E2 protein is a major regulator of viral DNA replication and gene expression. Through interactions with the viral origin binding protein, E1, it localizes E1 to the origin of replication and stimulates the initiation of viral DNA replication. However, several recent reports have described a number of diverse activities of E2 relating to the induction of apoptosis through both p53 dependent and independent mechanisms, and to induction of growth arrest in both the G1 and G2M phases of the cell cycle. Recent studies have also shown that p53 can specifically inhibit HPV DNA replication, albeit through an unknown mechanism. Since p53 has been described in the replication centres of Herpes Viruses, Adenovirus and SV40 we decided to investigate whether any of the above activities of E2 may be related to an association with p53. We show, in a series of in vitro assays, specific interaction between p53 and HPV-16 E2 via residues in the carboxy terminal half of the E2 protein. Mutational analysis of p53 indicates that sequences in both the DNA binding and oligomerization domains are essential for the interaction, and a mutant of p53 which is unable to bind E2 is also unable to inhibit HPV DNA replication. Finally, using an inducible system of p53 expression we also show that E2 will complex with p53 in vivo. These results raise the intriguing possibility that p53 may also be involved in HPV DNA replication centres, and also provides explanations for some of the diverse activities reported for the HPV E2 proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2051408106,"Ligands that bind to the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor are initially synthesized as integral membrane proteins that are released from the cell surface by regulated proteolysis. To study the role of the membrane-anchoring domain in ligand release, we made two artificial ligands. The first possessed the membrane-anchoring domain from EGF whereas the second had the corresponding domain from heparin binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF). Both ligands lacked amino-terminal extensions, and were epitope-tagged at the carboxyl terminus. Following stable expression in human mammary epithelial cells, their cellular localization and rate of proteolytic release were examined. We found that constructs with the membrane-anchoring domain from EGF were found primarily at the cell surface and displayed a relatively high rate of constitutive release. Constructs with the HB-EGF membrane-anchoring domain displayed a higher internalized fraction and a very low rate of constitutive release. The two ligand constructs also displayed different patterns of stimulated release. Proteolysis of the chimera with the HB-EGF membrane-anchoring domain was stimulated by activation of protein kinase C, but release of EGF from constructs with the EGF membrane-anchoring domain was insensitive to this. Calcium ionophores, calmodulin antagonists, and tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors stimulated the release of both ligands. Furthermore, the release of the two constructs showed different sensitivity to metalloprotease inhibitors. Despite a large fold-increase in ligand proteolysis following cell stimulation, only a small fraction of total cell-associated ligand was released per hour. Our results show that the membrane-anchoring domain of EGF-like ligands can specify both their localization and proteolytic processing. The structures of the membrane-anchoring region of this class of ligands can thus regulate their activity."

PcG proteins are able to repress gene activity over a considerable distance, presumably by spreading along the chromatin fiber. To limit spreading, and thus repression mediated by the PcG complex, endogenous stop signals within the chromatin, such as boundary elements, have been postulated. The concept of boundary elements stems from models in which the eukaryotic genome is divided into functionally independent chromatin domains. Chromatin domains are separated from each other by nucleoprotein structures, called insulators or boundary elements. In this model, insulators shield genes in one chromatin domain against enhancers or repressing complexes, such as the PcG proteins that operate in another chromatin domain (4Corces V.G.

In the enhancer blocking assay, a putative insulator is cloned between an enhancer and a promoter. The scs/scs′ and gypsy insulators as well as the 5′-HS element are able to efficiently prevent enhancer-promoter interactions (6Kellum R. Schedl P. Cell. 1991; 64: 941-950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 7Kellum R. Schedl P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2424-2431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Chung J.H. Whiteley M.

In another, frequently used assay, it is tested whether a putative insulator confers position-independent expression on an eye color (white) reporter gene in Drosophila. Stable integration of the white gene into the genome normally results in variable expression of the white gene, as monitored by the eye color. This variability is due to the random integration of the transgene into the genome. When the whitegene is flanked by the scs and scs′ insulators, the expression ofwhite becomes less variable between transformants (6Kellum R. Schedl P. Cell. 1991; 64: 941-950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). This has been interpreted as an indication that the insulators shield the transgene from either activating or repressing effects, emerging from the surrounding chromatin. This assay is, however, much less defined than the enhancer-blocking assay. In the enhancer-blocking assay, specific DNA sequences cloned in a defined construct can be tested in a controlled assay system. The position dependence assay, on the other hand, relies on random integration of a transgene into various positions in the genome and is, therefore, less defined. To study the ability of insulators to block transcriptional repression in a more controlled manner, we developed a repression assay in a human cell line, to monitor repression of a reporter gene by specific, well defined repressors. We tested whether insulators protect against repression, mediated by the PcG proteins HPC2 (19Satijn D.P.E. Olson D.J. van der Vlag J. Hamer C.M. Lambrechts A.C. Masselink H. Gunster M.J.

We found that the various insulators are able to block repression that is mediated by chromatin-associated repressors but with a high level of selectivity. The scs insulator was most effective in blocking repression, whereas the MAR/SAR element was completely ineffective. Our results suggest that different insulators can be classified according to their ability to block repression mediated by specific chromatin-associated repressors. Polycomb group (PcG)1proteins form chromatin-associated multimeric protein complexes that are involved in maintaining the transcriptional repressive state of genes during Drosophila and vertebrate development (1Cavalli G. Paro R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 354-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 2Kingston R.E. Bunker C.A. Imbalzano A.N.

PcG proteins are able to repress gene activity over a considerable distance, presumably by spreading along the chromatin fiber. To limit spreading, and thus repression mediated by the PcG complex, endogenous stop signals within the chromatin, such as boundary elements, have been postulated. The concept of boundary elements stems from models in which the eukaryotic genome is divided into functionally independent chromatin domains. Chromatin domains are separated from each other by nucleoprotein structures, called insulators or boundary elements. In this model, insulators shield genes in one chromatin domain against enhancers or repressing complexes, such as the PcG proteins that operate in another chromatin domain (4Corces V.G.

In this work, we show that SNURF, via the RING finger domain, enhances protein binding to Sp1 elements/GC boxes and interacts and cooperates with Sp1 in transcriptional activation. The activation of androgen receptor (AR) function requires regions other than the RING finger of SNURF, and SNURF does not influence binding of AR to cognate DNA elements. The zinc finger region (ZFR) together with the hinge region of AR are sufficient for contacting SNURF. The nuclear localization signal in the boundary between ZFR and the hinge region participates in the association of AR with SNURF, and a receptor mutant lacking the C-terminal part of the bipartite nuclear localization signal shows attenuated response to coexpressed SNURF. Some AR ZFR point mutations observed in patients with partial androgen insensitivity syndrome or male breast cancer impair the interaction of AR with SNURF and also render AR refractory to the transcription-activating effect of SNURF. Collectively, SNURF modulates the transcriptional activities of androgen receptor and Sp1 via different domains, and it may act as a functional link between steroid- and Sp1-regulated transcription.

The N-terminal regions of Sp proteins contain transactivation domains rich in glutamine and serine/threonine residues, and an additional transactivation region in the C terminus (the D domain) is involved in Sp1 synergistic function (46Pascal E. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1646-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Sp3 also contains an inhibitory domain, the function of which is promoter- and cell line-dependent. We recently identified a novel coactivator of AR-dependent transcription, a small nuclear RING finger protein termed SNURF, which interacts with the AR ZFR (27Moilanen A.-M. Poukka H. Karvonen U. Häkli M. Jänne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5128-5139Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). SNURF also associates with some other steroid receptors and modulates their transactivating functions. Besides steroid receptor-dependent promoters, SNURF also activates transcription from promoters driven by Sp1 elements/GC boxes. Interestingly, SNURF is able to bind to the TATA-binding protein, and it could thus act as a bridging factor between steroid receptors or other sequence-specific transcription factors and the general transcription machinery (27Moilanen A.-M. Poukka H. Karvonen U. Häkli M. Jänne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5128-5139Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). To gain a better understanding of the functional domains of SNURF, we have examined the ability of mutated SNURF forms to act as transcriptional coactivators in the context of both androgen- and Sp1-regulated promoters. The requirements for interactions between SNURF and AR were investigated by using a panel of mutated AR forms. Protease inhibitors aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were obtained from Sigma. Testosterone was purchased from Makor Chemicals. Mouse monoclonal M2 anti-Flag antibody, mouse monoclonal anti-Lex antibody, rabbit polyclonal anti-Sp1 antibody, and horse radish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG were obtained from Eastman Kodak Co.,CLONTECH, Santa Cruz, and Zymed Laboratories Inc., respectively. AP1 and Sp1 oligonucleotides were from Promega. To construct SNURF deletion mutants, a sequence encoding the Flag epitope was first inserted into pcDNA3.1(+) vector, after which polymerase chain reaction-generated N-terminal and C-terminal SNURF fragments were ligated C-terminal to the Flag-tag. SNURF point mutants were generated by the overlapping polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis strategy and inserted into the same vector. pSG5-rAR expression vectors for rat (r) and human (h) AR have been described (23Palvimo J.J.

Suske (University of Marburg, Germany). Yeast vectors pVP16 for expressing the transactivation domain of herpes simplex virus VP 16 protein and pLexN-a for expressing bacterial Lex-a with the nuclear localization signal of the SV40 large T antigen were kind gifts from Dr. S. M. Hollenberg (Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland, OR). LexN-a AR constructs were generated by inserting polymerase chain reaction-amplified fragments coding for amino acids 537–627 of rat AR into the BamHI/SalI site of pLexN-a, and GST-ZFR fusion proteins were created by inserting the same fragments intoBamHI/SalI site of pGEX-5X-1. COS-1 and CV-1 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 25 units/ml streptomycin and penicillin. For transient transfections using FuGene reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 3–3.5 × 104 cells were seeded on 12-well plates 24 h before transfections. For transfections by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (47Palvimo J.J. Kallio P.J. Ikonen T. Mehto M. Jänne O.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1399-1407PubMed Google Scholar, 48Ikonen T.

Four h before the addition of DNA, the cells received fresh medium with 10% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum. After 18 h, the medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplied with 2% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum and 100 nm testosterone or vehicle. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities and the concentration of soluble cell proteins were assayed as described previously (47Palvimo J.J. Kallio P.J. Ikonen T. Mehto M. Jänne O.A. Mol.

Statistical analyses were carried out with two-tailed Student's ttest. COS-1 cell extracts were prepared in modified radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Immunoprecipitation with mouse monoclonal anti-Flag antibody was performed as described (27Moilanen A.-M. Poukka H. Karvonen U. Häkli M. Jänne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5128-5139Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), and the samples were resolved on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels under denaturing conditions. Proteins were transferred onto Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and visualized by using the ECL detection reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoblots on yeast cell extracts were performed as described previously (27Moilanen A.-M. Poukka H. Karvonen U. Häkli M. Jänne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5128-5139Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). GST and GST-ZFR mutants expressed in E. coli were purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) essentially as described (22Kallio P.J. Poukka H. Moilanen A. Jänne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1017-1028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in a buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.8, 150 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mmMgCl2, 50 μm ZnCl2, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 3 μg/ml pepstatin A. Fusion proteins (5 μg/20 μl glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads) were incubated with 5 μl of [35S]methionine-labeled SNURF or luciferase synthesized by translation in vitro for 60 min at 4 °C in 500 μl of binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 50 mmKCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.4% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 mm MgCl2, and 50 μm ZnCl2) in the presence of protease inhibitors. The beads were then washed four times with 1 ml of binding buffer. Bound proteins were released in an SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer at 95 °C for 4 min, resolved by electrophoresis under denaturing conditions, and visualized by fluorography. EMSAs were performed as previously outlined (50Palvimo J.J. Partanen M. Jänne O.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 993-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, whole cell extracts from COS-1 cells transiently transfected by electroporation or by using FuGene reagent were preincubated at 4 °C for 30 min before the addition of 20 fmol of 32P-labeled double-stranded Sp1-binding site oligonucleotide (5′-ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAG-3′), AP1-binding site oligonucleotide (5′-CGCTTGATGAGTCAGCCGGAA-3′), or androgen receptor response element (ARE) oligonucleotide (5′-GATCATAGTACGTGATGTTCTCAAGATC-3′). When antibodies were used, the preincubation was extended to 90 min before the addition of the probe. The binding reaction was performed for 30 min, and protein-DNA complexes were resolved on 4% polyacrylamide gels under nondenaturing conditions at 4 °C. Saccharomyces cerevisiaestrain L40 (a gift from S. M. Hollenberg) was transformed with plasmids encoding LexN-a AR and VP16 AD or VP16 AD fused to SNURF amino acids 20–177. The transformants were plated on a selective medium, and β-galactosidase activities were assayed from three separate liquid yeast cultures according to the instructions of the Matchmaker two-hybrid system (CLONTECH). To map the functional domains of SNURF, a series of deletion and point mutants was generated (Fig. 1 A). Cotransfection of COS-1 cells with a construct encoding wild-type SNURF along with the reporter Sp12-TATA-LUC, which contains two binding sites for Sp1 in front of the TATA box, activated the promoter by ∼40-fold (Fig. 1 B). Deletion of the N-terminal 20 amino acids containing a part of the consensus bipartite NLS (mutant Δ1–20) did not prevent SNURF from entering the nucleus (data not shown) but blunted its ability to stimulate reporter gene transcription (p < 0.01). Deletion of amino acids 66–98 encompassing a region with positively charged residues also severely attenuated the activation of the reporter gene (p < 0.01), whereas deletions of negatively charged regions (Δ31–65 and Δ99–118) only weakly influenced the function of SNURF. Any insult in the RING finger domain totally abrogated the ability of SNURF to stimulate transcription from the Sp12-TATA-LUC reporter (mutants Δ121–143, Δ178–194, Δ157–194, CS1 (C136S/C139S), CS2 (C177S/C180S), and CS3 (C136S/C139S/C177S/C180S)). Similar results were obtained with the AP1-Sp1-TATA-LUC reporter (27Moilanen A.-M. Poukka H. Karvonen U. Häkli M. Jänne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5128-5139Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). 2H. Poukka, P. Aarnisalo, J. J. Palvimo, and O. A. Jänne, unpublished observations. To elucidate the mechanism(s) underlying SNURF-mediated stimulation of the Sp1-regulated reporter, we examined by using EMSA the possibility that SNURF influences protein binding to Sp1 elements. Extracts from COS-1 cells transfected with an empty expression vector or plasmids encoding SNURF or the RING finger-deficient SNURF-CS1 mutant were incubated with32P-labeled double-stranded Sp1 oligonucleotide. Extracts from cells overexpressing wild-type SNURF but not the SNURF-CS1 mutant showed significantly increased binding of proteins to the Sp1 element (Fig. 2 A, lanes 1–9). All detected protein-DNA complexes were specific for the Sp1 element, as they were fully competed for by a 200-fold molar excess of cold Sp1 oligonucleotide but not by the same amount of AP1 oligonucleotide (lanes 10 and 11). Immunoblotting of the same cell extracts with an Sp1-specific antibody ruled out the possibility that expression of SNURF would have increased the amount of cellular Sp1 protein (Fig. 2 B). To identify Sp1 protein among the protein-DNA complexes, the cell extract was preincubated with an anti-Sp1 antibody, which resulted in the disappearance of the uppermost band and appearance of a supershifted complex (Fig. 2 A, lane 12). The bands unaffected by the Sp1 antibody probably represent other GC box-binding proteins such as Sp3 and/or Sp4. SNURF stabilized DNA binding of these proteins as well, but not to the same extent as that of Sp1 (cf. Fig. 2 A, lanes 5 and6 versus lane 3). The effect of SNURF appeared to be specific for GC box-binding proteins, as SNURF overexpression did not influence AR-ARE interaction or the amount of proteins binding to an AP1 element (Fig. 2, C andD). We performed coimmunoprecipitation assays on extracts from COS-1 cells expressing Flag-tagged SNURF or SNURF-CS1 to assess whether SNURF and Sp1 interact physically. Protein complexes precipitated by a monoclonal anti-Flag antibody were subjected to immunoblotting with an anti-Sp1 antibody. As illustrated in Fig. 3 A, endogenous Sp1 protein coimmunoprecipitated with the wild-type SNURF but not with the RING finger-deficient mutant. To study the role of SNURF in Sp1-mediated transcription further, COS-1 cells were cotransfected with the Sp12-TATA-LUC reporter along with Sp1 and/or SNURF expression vectors. Coexpressed Sp1 stimulated the reporter gene activity only minimally over the activity seen with endogenous Sp1 (Fig. 4). However, a strong synergistic activation was observed when SNURF was cotransfected with Sp1 (p < 0.05). It is of note that the amount of SNURF expression plasmid used in this experiment (100 ng/well) yielded only ∼10% of the maximal activity obtained with a saturating SNURF concentration (300 ng/well, see Fig. 1 B). Ectopic expression of Sp3, an inhibitory member of the Sp1 family (44Hagen G. Müller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar), slightly diminished the reporter activity achieved with SNURF or SNURF together with Sp1, and no synergism between Sp3 and SNURF was observed (Fig. 4). The RING finger of SNURF was necessary for the synergistic activation to occur, as the SNURF-CS1 mutant was unable to cooperate with coexpressed Sp1. The enhancement of reporter gene activity was dependent on the Sp1-binding sites on the promoter, since a reporter construct devoid of these sites did not respond to ectopically expressed Sp1.2 Wild-type SNURF activates AR-mediated transcription more efficiently than the CS1 mutant, but it also enhances the activity of reporter genes in the absence of hormone. SNURF-CS1 exhibits ∼50–80% of the wild-type SNURF activity without influencing the basal activity of androgen-regulated promoters (27Moilanen A.-M. Poukka H. Karvonen U. Häkli M. Jänne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5128-5139Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). To examine the importance of various SNURF regions in the enhancement of AR-dependent transactivation, we transfected COS-1 cells with pARE2-TATA-LUC and pSG5-rAR along with vectors encoding SNURF deletion mutants (Fig. 5 A). To eliminate the influence of SNURF on basal reporter activity, the CS1 mutant was used as a reference, and the CS1 mutation (C136S/C139S) was included in all the deletion constructs shown in Fig. 5. None of the mutants studied activated the reporter gene in the absence of AR or testosterone (data not shown). Interestingly, the loss of the N-terminal 20 amino acids, a region rich in positively charged residues, and deletion of amino acids 31–65, a negatively charged region, abolished the ability of SNURF to enhance AR-dependent transactivation (p < 0.01). Deletion of another region containing a stretch of positively charged residues (CS1Δ66–98) also resulted in a marked reduction in the coactivator function (p < 0.01), whereas the more C-terminal stretch of negatively charged residues (CS1Δ99–118) had a smaller effect on AR function. When the same N-terminal deletions of SNURF were studied in CV-1 cells, a similar pattern was seen (Fig. 5 B). Deletions affecting the RING finger structure tended to diminish the activity of SNURF in both cells lines, whereas point mutations of the two most C-terminal cysteines (CS2) were tolerated in CV-1 cells but, surprisingly, not in COS-1 cells (Fig. 5), suggesting that cell-specific factors are involved in the RING finger interactions. To investigate the ability of SNURF to integrate AR- and Sp1-mediated transcriptional responses, pARE2-tk-LUC reporter containing two AREs in front of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase proximal promoter (−105 to +51) was transfected to COS-1 cells (Fig. 5 C). This portion of herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter contains two GC/GT box sites that are separated by 50 nucleotides. The experiments were carried out in the presence of AR expression, both without and with 100 nm testosterone. Ectopic expression of Sp1 stimulated the reporter gene activity almost 2-fold, and wild-type SNURF and the addition of androgen increased it by 3.8- and 3.3-fold, respectively.

Thereafter, CD5 levels are coordinately up-regulated with cell surface CD3 (5Weiss A. Dazin P.F. Shields R. Fu S.M. Lanier L.L. J. Immunol. 1987; 139: 3245-3250PubMed Google Scholar).

Today. 1991; 12: 389-392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Only the B-1a subset expresses CD5. B-1a cells have unusual properties (reviewed in Ref. 11Tarakhovsky A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 981-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) such as self-renewal capacity. They constitute a substantial fraction of the peritoneal and pleural mouse B cells.It has long been known that in T lymphocytes a proportion of CD5 associates with the T-cell receptor (TCR)1 at the membrane (12Burgess K.E. Yamamoto M. Prasad K.V. Rudd C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9311-9315Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar,13Osman N. Ley S.C. Crumpton M.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 2995-3000Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). CD5 effect on TCR-mediated responses remained, however, elusive until the establishment of CD5-knockout mice. In the absence of CD5, immature T cells were hyperresponsive to TCR stimulation in vitro (14Tarakhovsky A. Kanner S.B. Hombach J. Ledbetter J.A. Müller W. Killeen N. Rajewsky K. Science. 1996; 269: 535-537Crossref Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Increased proliferation and, at the signaling level, increased tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C (PLC) γ-1, LAT (linker for activation of T cells), and Vav associated with increased Ca2+ response were observed. An increased expression of the fully tyrosine phosphorylated p23 species of the TCRζ chain that adequately recruits and activates the protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK) ZAP-70 was also noticed. Accordingly, a possible critical role for CD5 in regulating the phosphorylation state of ζ was also reported in human thymocytes (15Gary-Gouy H. Lang V. Sarun S. Boumsell L. Bismuth G. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 3739-3747PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it was proposed that CD5 may negatively influence the activity of critical signaling elements between the TCR and the Ca2+ response, particularly in immature T cells. The cytoplasmic domain of CD5 is tyrosine phosphorylated after TCR engagement (12Burgess K.E. Yamamoto M. Prasad K.V. Rudd C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9311-9315Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 16Davies A.A. Ley S.C. Crumpton M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It was therefore assumed that this phenomenon may help to recruit Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing signaling molecules with inhibitory properties. Notably, an implication of the SH2 domain-bearing tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 was predicted. SHP-1 is known to exert a negative influence on the early tyrosine phosphorylation events elicited by TCR activation (18Plas D.R. Johnson R. Pingel J.T. Matthews R.J. Dalton M. Roy G. Chan A.C. Thomas M.L. Science. 1996; 272: 1173-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 19Raab M. Rudd C.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and it was reported to associate with CD5 in murine thymocytes (20Pani G. Fischer K.D. Mlinaric-Rascan I. Siminovitch K.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 839-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Moreover, an association of SHP-1 that requires a tyrosine residue (at position 378) in an immunoreceptor tyrosine based inhibition motif (ITIM)-like sequence straddling the transmembrane and the cytoplasmic domain of CD5 was also described in Jurkat T cells (21Perez-Villar J.J. Whitney G.S. Bowen M.A. Hewgill D.H. Aruffo A.A. Kanner S.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2903-2912Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar).CD5 is also associated with the B-cell receptor (BCR) (22Lankester A.C. van Schijndel G.M.W. Cordell J.L. van Noesel C.J.M. van Lier R.A.W. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 812-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and studies in CD5-deficient mice also suggested a negative role of the molecule on BCR signaling. Normal CD5+ peritoneal B-1 cells proliferate poorly in response to an anti-μ stimulation. Proliferation was restored in CD5-negative mice (23Bikah G. Carey J. Ciallella J.R. Tarakhovsky A. Bondada S. Science. 1996; 274: 1906-1909Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Ca2+ response also increased in parallel. Thus, CD5 molecules may also down-regulate some early signaling events of the BCR biochemical pathway. In agreement with this assumption was the finding that a previous cross-linking of CD5 on normal B-1 cells could restore anti-IgM-induced proliferation, likely by moving these molecules away from the BCR (23Bikah G. Carey J. Ciallella J.R. Tarakhovsky A. Bondada S. Science. 1996; 274: 1906-1909Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). However, no direct evidence has been yet provided showing that CD5 could inhibit early signaling events triggered through the BCR. The present study was undertaken to investigate this possibility.To analyze the regulatory properties of CD5 on BCR signaling, we expressed in a murine B cell line a chimeric membrane receptor made of the cytoplasmic domain of CD5 (CD5cyt), beginning at residue lysine 379, with the extracellular and transmembrane domains of the low affinity IgG receptor FcγRIIB. Our results demonstrate that when coligated with the BCR, the CD5 chimera strongly antagonized both biochemical and functional BCR stimulatory events. They also show the key role played by the cytoplasmic sequence of CD5, which comprises two tyrosine residues in a pseudo-immunoreceptor tyrosine based activation motif (ITAM). They further suggest that the inhibitory action of CD5 is mediated by different molecules in B cells and T cells because our results show no clear implication of SHP-1.DISCUSSIONOnly few studies investigated the signaling properties of CD5 in B cells. As with its T-cell counterpart, a privileged physical link between CD5 and the B-cell antigen-specific receptor in CD5+ B cells was demonstrated (22Lankester A.C. van Schijndel G.M.W. Cordell J.L. van Noesel C.J.M. van Lier R.A.W. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 812-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Several reports also suggested a possible cooperation between the two receptors at the functional level leading to the hypothesis that CD5 positively contributes to B cell activation (41Cerutti A. Trentin L. Zambello R. Sancetta R. Milani A. Tassinari C. Adami F. Agostini C. Semenzato G. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 1854-1862PubMed Google Scholar, 42Jamin C. Le Corre R. Lydyard P.M. Youinou P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Other arguments arising from studies in CD5 knockout mice promote instead a negative role of CD5 on BCR-induced responses. To further elucidate this problem, we studied in a murine B cell model the consequences of coligation of BCR with CD5 on BCR-mediated responses.The IIA1.6 murine B cell model, a FcγRIIB-negative variant of the A20 lymphoma B cell line, is ideally suited to analyze the effects of receptors that may interfere with BCR signaling. Indeed, by constructing a chimeric molecule containing the extracellular domain of FcγRIIB and the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor, one can use a straightforward procedure to bring into close contact the chimera with the BCR using a single Ab. We therefore used this system to investigate the effects of CD5 on BCR stimulatory events. Our results unambiguously demonstrate an inhibition of B cell activation by the cytoplasmic domain of CD5. Striking effects were especially observed at the functional level because IL-2 synthesis was suppressed by CD5. This was explained by our parallel observations that, at the biochemical level, both Ca2+ and Ras activation pathways activated through the BCR were strongly antagonized upon coligation with the chimera.BCR-induced Ca2+ responses were negatively controlled by CD5 after coligation of the two receptors. The initial Ca2+rise was identical with RAM IgG or RAM F(ab′)2 fragments, but it was abruptly stopped a few seconds later and returned rapidly to basal levels (Fig. 2). We found in parallel a partial reduction of PLCγ-1 phosphorylation that could explain this Ca2+inhibition. However, kinetic studies showed that induction of PLCγ-1 phosphorylation was not affected at this early time course. We even found an increased phosphorylation for short periods of stimulation with whole IgG. Thus, inhibition of PLCγ-1 metabolism may be not the primary event. The measure of other parameters of PLCγ-1 activation is now under progress to clarify this point. An inhibitory effect of CD5 on TCR-induced Ca2+ responses in Jurkat T cells was recently reported after coligation of CD5 with the CD3 molecule (21Perez-Villar J.J. Whitney G.S. Bowen M.A. Hewgill D.H. Aruffo A.A. Kanner S.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2903-2912Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Experiments in Ca2+-free medium were not performed. However, the obtained Ca2+ profiles suggested no or poor inhibition of the sustained Ca2+ influx phase by CD5. On the contrary, we found a severe inhibition of Ca2+ influx in our B cell model. Sustained Ca2+ influx phase is crucial to trigger transcription of various genes in lymphocytes, like the IL-2 gene (43Crabtree G.R. Cell. 1999; 96: 611-614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). This ultimately suggests that the outcome of CD5-mediated inhibition may be more severe in B cells than in T cells. Accordingly, CD5 seems to have a stronger effect on BCR-induced proliferation, as illustrated in mice by the results obtained with B1a cells whose proliferation is restored in CD5 knockout animals or, more spectacularly, after keeping CD5 well away from the BCR (23Bikah G. Carey J. Ciallella J.R. Tarakhovsky A. Bondada S. Science. 1996; 274: 1906-1909Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar).Coligation of the FcγRIIB-CD5 chimera with BCR induced a strong tyrosine phosphorylation of CD5cyt. The Src PTK Lyn is presumably involved because it has already been shown to be responsible for FcγRIIB1 phosphorylation in similar stimulatory conditions in mast cells (40Malbec O. Fong D.C. Turner M. Tybulewicz V.L. Cambier J.C. Fridman W.H. Daeron M. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1647-1658PubMed Google Scholar). The B-cell coreceptor CD22 is also phosphorylated by Lyn (44Smith K.G.C. Tarlinton D.M. Doody G.M. Hibbs M.L. Fearon D.T. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 807-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation of CD5 is likely required to observe the inhibitory effect. This is in agreement with our observations using the YSQPX 8YPAL CD5 deletant together with the general scheme explaining how cell surface antigens, using particular motifs of their cytoplasmic domain, the so-called ITIM sequences, inhibit neighboring activation receptors. Tyrosine phosphorylated ITIMs recruit SH2-containing phosphatases switching off the activity of PTKs and/or dephosphorylating key downstream elements of the response (reviewed in Refs. 45Unkeless J.C. Jin J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 338-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar and 46Vivier E. Daëron M. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 286-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Whether phosphorylated tyrosine residues inside CD5cyt may also represent docking sites for SH2-containing phosphatases was therefore an important question.SHP-1 is a cytosolic tyrosine phosphatase, widely expressed in hematopoietic cells. SHP-1 exerts a negative regulatory influence on the early tyrosine phosphorylation events elicited after activation of different tyrosine kinase-associated receptors, like the TCR (18Plas D.R.

Commun. 1996; 222: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) or the BCR (47Cyster J.G. Goodenow C.C.

Med. 1995; 181: 2077-2084Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). By means of its two SH2 domains, SHP-1 binds to the phosphorylated tyrosine of the ITIM motifs present in the cytoplasmic domain of various inhibitory receptors, for example molecules of the KIR family in NK cells (49Campbell K.S. Dessing M. Lopez-Botet M. Cella M. Colonna M. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 50Fry A.M. Lanier L.L. Weiss A. J. Exp.

A. 1998; 95: 2446-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) in B cells. Its participation in the inhibitory effects of these receptors is now well accepted, raising the possibility that SHP-1 is also involved in the effects of CD5. This question has been addressed for the first time by Pani et al. (20Pani G. Fischer K.D. Mlinaric-Rascan I. Siminovitch K.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 839-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) in TCR-activated murine thymocytes. They showed that CD5 became heavily phosphorylated after TCR stimulation, and they detected SHP-1 in CD5 immunoprecipitates. However, SHP-1 was also associated with CD5 in resting thymocytes where CD5 was not significantly phosphorylated, suggesting a mechanism not involving SH2-ITIM interaction. In a recent work performed in Jurkat human T cells, an interaction of SHP-1 with CD5, increased after TCR stimulation, was also reported (21Perez-Villar J.J. Whitney G.S. Bowen M.A. Hewgill D.H. Aruffo A.A. Kanner S.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2903-2912Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Especially, it was shown that a particular tyrosine residue of CD5, Tyr378, in an ITIM-like motif, was crucial for the binding of SHP-1 and the inhibition of T cell activation mediated by CD5.However, our results show that the effect of CD5 on BCR signaling is independent of SHP-1 for several reasons. First, and importantly, this tyrosine residue, which is in a very charged region of the molecule just at the junction of transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, was missing in our CD5 chimera. Second, we did not observe any coprecipitation of SHP-1 with the phosphorylated FcγRIIB-CD5 chimera in IIA 1.6 transfected cells. We cannot exclude that a faint amount of SHP-1, not detectable in our assay conditions, is present. A supplementary argument, however, does not support this possibility. Indeed, experiments made with phosphopeptides of CD5cyt showed that the SH2 domains of SHP-1 did not bind to any CD5cyt phosphopeptides (54Dennehy K.M. Broszeit R. Ferris W.F. Beyers A.D. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 1617-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we can notice from the sequence of CD5 (Fig. 1) that a particular motif, with a serine in position −2 (SAYPAL), is also present inside the pseudo-ITAM. It is different from the prototypal inhibitory sequence (I/V)XYXX(L/V) found in most inhibitory receptors. Nevertheless, this motif is present in the mast cell function-associated antigen, a murine inhibitory co-receptor member of the C-type lectin family where the I/V residue at position −2 is replaced by a serine residue (55Guthmann M.D. Tal M. Pecht I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9397-9401Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Thus, we also controlled with a phosphorylated peptide of the pseudo-ITAM that this sequence did not precipitate SHP-1 or SHP-2 from lysates of the lymphoma B cells (data not shown). As a supplementary argument, it should be emphasized that in IIA 1.6 B cells, inhibitory chimeric receptors that recruit SHP-1, such as those containing the cytoplasmic domain of a KIR, abolished the Ca2+ mobilization phase (39Bruhns P. Marchetti P. Fridman W.H. Vivier E. Daeron M. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3168-3175PubMed Google Scholar). This phase is weakly inhibited by CD5, suggesting again a distinct mechanism. This also agrees with our observation that phosphorylation of PLCγ-1 is not impaired by CD5 at the initial phase of the response (Fig. 2 B).Phosphorylated FcγRIIB recruits SHIP in vivo (34Ono M. Bolland S. Tempst P. Ravetch J.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar, 35D'Ambrosio D. Fong D.C. Cambier J.C. Immunol. Lett. 1996; 54: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 36Gupta N. Scharenberg A.M. Burshtyn D.N. Wagtmann N. Lioubin M.N. Rohrschneider L.R. Kinet J.P. Long E.O. J. Exp.

Immunol. 1997; 27: 1994-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). SHIP is a signal transduction molecule with inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatase activity (56Lioubin M.N. Algate P.A. Tsai S. Carlberg K. Aebersold A. Rohrschneider L.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1084-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). One proposed target for SHIP is phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI-3,4,5-P3) (57Scharenberg A.M. El-Hillal O. Fruman D.A. Beitz L.O. Li Z. Lin S. Gout I. Cantley L.C. Rawlings D.J. Kinet J.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1961-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). PI-3,4,5-P3 mediates the translocation to the plasma membrane of important signaling molecules for the Ca2+response containing a PI-3,4,5-P3-binding PH domain, like the Bruton's tyrosine kinase (58Takata M. Kurosaki T. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Thus SHIP could impair Ca2+ responses by regulating membrane association of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (59Bolland S. Pearse R.N. Kurosaki T. Ravetch J.V. Immunity. 1998; 8: 509-516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Moreover, a competitive role was also proposed for SHIP in blocking the interaction of Shc with the Grb2-Sos complex of proteins that lead to Ras activation in B cells (60Tridandapani S. Chacko G.W. Van Brocklyn J.R. Coggeshall K.M. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 1125-1132PubMed Google Scholar, 61Tridandapani S. Pradhan M. LaDine J.R. Garber S. Anderson C.L. Coggeshall K.M. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 1408-1414PubMed Google Scholar). CD5 inhibitory effects seem to be very close from those triggered by FcγRIIB1, suggesting an identical inhibitory mechanism. Thus, quite similar Ca2+ profiles were obtained upon coligation of BCR with either receptors, and we report a strong inhibition of Ras pathway by CD5. However, we did not find any recruitment of SHIP by the phosphorylated chimera in coprecipitation experiments (Fig. 4 B) or by the phosphorylated CD5 peptides (not shown). This prompted us to conclude that the mechanism responsible for the inhibition by CD5 of BCR activation in IIA1.6 murine B cells was also independent of SHIP. Other inhibitory phosphates may exist, and we did not check yet the new inositol 5-phosphatase SHIP2 showing homology with SHIP (62Pesesse X. Deleu S. De Smedt F. Drayer L. Erneux C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar).Obviously, molecules with other biological activities may be responsible. After TCR stimulation, CD5 is phosphorylated on tyrosine but also, heavily, on serine residue (16Davies A.A. Ley S.C. Crumpton M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6368-6372Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic tail of CD5 contains at least five consensus sites for serine/threonine phosphorylation. No clear function was assigned for these phosphorylations in the physiology of CD5, but a serine kinase activity, increased after CD3 stimulation, is immunoprecipitated with CD5 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (63Alberola-Ila J. Places L. Lozano F. Vives J. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 4423-4430PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, a constitutive phosphorylation of CD5 on serine residues 459 and 461 has been reported that can be involved in the regulation of phosphatidylcholine-PLC metabolism by the receptor (64Simarro M. Pelassy C. Calvo J. Places L. Aussel C. Lozano F. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 4307-4315PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, association of CD5 with different serine kinases, like casein kinase II (65Calvo J. Vilda J.M. Places L. Simarro M. Padilla O. Andreu D. Campbell K.S. Aussel C. Lozano F. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6022-6029PubMed Google Scholar) or Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinases (66Gringhuis S.I. de Leij L.F.M.H. Wayman G.A. Tokumitsu H. Vellenga E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31809-31820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar,67Bauch A. Campbell K.S. Reth M. Eur J Immunol. 1998; 28: 2167-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), was reported. CD5 also activates in T cells acidic sphingomyelinase, protein kinase C-ζ, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase, and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (68Simarro M. Calvo J. Vila J.M. Places L. Padilla O. Alberola-Ila J. Vives J. Lozano F. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 5149-5155PubMed Google Scholar). A role for these different pathways, especially those linked to serine phosphorylation of CD5, is therefore disputable to explain its inhibitory action. Our results showed, however, that the pseudo ITAM of CD5 was necessary, suggesting a mechanism governed by phosphorylated tyrosine residues. Importantly, this phosphorylated motif binds different signaling molecules like phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, Ras GTPase-activating protein, and, undirectly, the proto-oncoprotein c-Cbl (54Dennehy K.M. Broszeit R. Ferris W.F. Beyers A.D. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 1617-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 69Dennehy K.M. Broszeit R. Garnett D. Durrheim G.A. Spruyt L.L. Beyers A.D. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 679-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Much speculation can be made how recruitment of these molecules on phosphorylated CD5 within a CD5-BCR complex may hinder the normal functioning of BCR signaling cascade. But phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase is essential for B cell development and proliferation (70Fruman D.A. Snapper S.B. Yballe C.M. Davidson L. Yu J.Y. Alt F.W. Cantley L.C. Science. 1999; 283: 393-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). A critical role is also likely played by c-Cbl because the molecule can negatively regulate Syk PTK (71Lupher Jr., M.L. Rao N.

By altering BCR targeting of such key signaling molecules, CD5 may therefore profoundly influence signaling downstream of the BCR. CD5, a 67-kDa"

PfSUB-1 undergoes extensive posttranslational proteolytic processing. The primary translation product is converted in the parasite endoplasmic reticulum to p54. This is further processed to p47, which accumulates in secretory organelles within the merozoite. Here, we present a detailed study of this processing. In vitro translated PfSUB-1 showed no capacity to undergo autocatalytic processing. However, parasite extracts contain a protease that cleaves the in vitro translated proprotein between Asp219 and Asn220 to form two products of 31 (p31) and 54 kDa; the latter was indistinguishable from authentic p54 and remained complexed with p31 in a noncovalent interaction characteristic of that between a subtilase prodomain and its cognate catalytic domain. Cross-linking studies showed that this complex also exists in the parasite. Expression of PfSUB-1 in recombinant baculovirus also resulted in processing to p54. Mutation of the predicted active site serine abolished processing. Recombinant p54 was secreted in a complex with p31, and could be further converted to p47 in vitro.Conversion required calcium, was an intramolecular autocatalytic process, and involved a second cleavage between Asp251 and Ala252. A decapeptide based on sequence flanking Asp219 was efficiently cleaved by recombinant PfSUB-1. We conclude that PfSUB-1 is a subtilase with an unusual substrate specificity and that it is activated by two autocatalytic processing steps."
https://openalex.org/W2066689625,"Nerve growth factor (NGF) induces apoptosis in a human medulloblastoma cell line (MED283) engineered to express TrkA (MED283-TrkA) (Muragaki, Y., Chou, T. T., Kaplan, D. R., Trojanowski, J. Q., and Lee, V. M. (1997) J. Neurosci. 17, 530–542). To dissect the molecular signaling pathway that mediates this novel effect, specific receptor mutations in Trk have been employed. We showed that phosphorylation of tyrosine 490 is required for activation of phosphoinositide 3-OH kinase, whereas phosphorylation of tyrosine 785 is required for activation of phospholipase C-γ. TrkA-mediated apoptosis was abolished when either the ATP-binding site or both tyrosines 490 and 785 were mutated. Because tyrosines 490 and 785 mediate redundant signaling through the Ras-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Ras-ERK) pathway, we examined the role of Ras-ERK signaling in NGF-induced apoptosis. We found that MED283-TrkA cells expressing a dominant negative Ras inhibitor (N17Ras) failed to undergo ERK activation and apoptosis following NGF treatment, whereas the ERK kinase (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase) inhibitors PD98059 and U0126 eliminated ERK activation but had no effect on apoptosis. We infer from these data that NGF-induced apoptosis is mediated by a novel Ras and/or Raf signaling pathway. Nerve growth factor (NGF) induces apoptosis in a human medulloblastoma cell line (MED283) engineered to express TrkA (MED283-TrkA) (Muragaki, Y., Chou, T. T., Kaplan, D. R., Trojanowski, J.

Barde Y.A. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 289-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (1788) Google Scholar). The signal transduction mechanism by which NGF generates diverse cellular responses has been studied extensivelyin vitro using a variety of cell culture model systems, most notably the rat pheochromocytoma cell line PC12 (2Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4873) Google Scholar). The effects of NGF on PC12 cells are mediated by the high affinity NGF receptor known as TrkA, which is one of the three major cognate receptors of neurotrophins (3Kaplan D.R. Martin-Zanca D. Parada L.F. Nature. 1991; 350: 158-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar, 4Klein R. Jing S.Q. Nanduri V. O'Rourke E. Barbacid M. Cell. 1991; 65: 189-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar). NGF activates TrkA through receptor dimerization and activation of an intrinsic tyrosine kinase (5Jing S. Tapley P. Barbacid M. Neuron. 1992; 9: 1067-1079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Trans-phosphorylation of TrkA by its intrinsic kinase stabilizes the receptor and facilitates phosphorylation of recognition sites for associated signaling molecules (6Cunningham M.E. Stephens R.M. Kaplan D.R. Greene L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10957-10967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). For example, among the better characterized proteins that associate with phosphorylated TrkA are SHC and PLC-γ, which bind to tyrosine residues at positions 490 and 785, respectively (7Obermeier A.

Greene L.A. Kaplan D.R. Neuron. 1994; 12: 691-705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Both of these proteins mediate signaling through the well characterized Ras-ERK pathway and ultimately affect changes in gene expression (9Segal R.A. Greenberg M.E. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 463-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar, 10Wood K.W. Sarnecki C. Roberts T.M. Blenis J. Cell. 1992; 68: 1041-1050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). SHC is also critical for the activation of phosphotidylinositide 3-OH kinase (11Hallberg B. Ashcroft M. Loeb D.M. Kaplan D.R. Downward J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 691-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), which, along with its substrate Akt, participates in the prevention of apoptosis in PC12 cells following NGF withdrawal (12Yao R. Cooper G.M. Science. 1995; 267: 2003-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar, 13Dudek H. Datta S.R. Franke T.F. Birnbaum M.J. Yao R. Cooper G.M. Segal R.A. Kaplan D.R. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1997; 275: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (2222) Google Scholar). Whereas in PC12 cells NGF promotes cell cycle arrest, differentiation, and survival, NGF mediates pleiotropic effects that are cell type-specific. For example, chromaffin cells and TrkA-expressing NIH-3T3 fibroblasts proliferate in response to NGF (14Lillien L.E. Claude P. Nature. 1985; 317: 632-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 15Cordon-Cardo C. Tapley P. Jing S.Q. Nanduri V. O'Rourke E. Lamballe F. Kovary K. Klein R. Jones K.R. Reichardt L.F. Cell. 1991; 66: 173-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). The mechanism whereby NGF induces differentiation in one cell type and proliferation in another remains unclear, but NGF-mediated differentiation has been linked to at least two specific protein kinase targets. First, fibroblast growth factor receptor substrate-2, a lipid-anchored docking protein of tyrosine kinase receptors, is preferentially tyrosine-phosphorylated during NGF-induced differentiation (16Rabin S.J. Cleghon V. Kaplan D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2203-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 17Kouhara H. Hadari Y.R. Spivak-Kroizman T. Schilling J. Bar-Sagi D. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1997; 89: 693-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). And second, the cyclin-dependent-kinase inhibitor p21Waf1/Cip1 is selectively induced in cells that undergo cell cycle arrest in response to NGF (17Kouhara H. Hadari Y.R. Spivak-Kroizman T. Schilling J. Bar-Sagi D. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1997; 89: 693-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar, 18Yan G.Z. Ziff E.B. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 6200-6212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the cell type-specific effects of NGF may be determined by the activation of distinctly different signaling pathways in cells of different lineages. Although there is an extensive body of literature on the important role of neurotrophins in the developing and mature nervous system, only recently have neurotrophins been implicated in the onset or progression of central nervous system tumors. For example, NGF has been suggested to influence the phenotype of MBs, i.e. prototypical primitive neuroectodermal tumors that arise in the cerebellum and that are among the most common central nervous system tumors in children (19Rorke L.B. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Zimmerman R.A. Sutton L.N. Biegel J.A. Goldwein J.W. Packer R.J. Brain Pathol. 1997; 7: 765-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Morphologically, MBs resemble neuroectodermal stem cells, and they often show a neuron-like phenotype, as evidenced by the expression of neuron-specific lineage markers (20Fung K.M. Trojanowski J.Q. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1995; 54: 285-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). MBs are thought to arise from granule cell progenitors in the external granule layer of the developing cerebellum (21Goodrich L.V. Milenkovic L. Higgins K.M. Scott M.P. Science. 1997; 277: 1109-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1435) Google Scholar), and it has been reported that the abundance of trkC mRNA expression correlates with a better response to therapy in pediatric patients with MB (22Segal R.A. Goumnerova L.C. Kwon Y.K. Stiles C.D. Pomeroy S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12867-12871Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Although our earlier studies failed to implicate NGF and low affinity NGF receptor in modulating the behavior of MB cells (23Pleasure S.J. Reddy U.R. Venkatakrishnan G. Roy A.K. Chen J. Ross A.H. Trojanowski J.Q. Pleasure D.E. Lee V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8496-8500Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), a subsequent study of the same MB cells engineered to express TrkA on their cell surface yielded the unexpected finding that activation of these receptors led to extensive apoptosis (24Muragaki Y. Chou T.T. Kaplan D.R. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 530-542Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We hypothesized that NGF may induce apoptosis specifically through activation of specific signal transduction pathways. To begin to elucidate this pathway, we undertook studies described herein, which demonstrate that NGF induces apoptosis in TrkA-transfected MED283 cells (MED283-TrkA) via redundant pathways that are Ras-dependent but MEK-independent. Thus, we report the initial molecular dissection of a novel cell death pathway in MB and suggest that further dissection of this cell death pathway may provide new targets for the development of more effective therapies for these and other brain tumors. Murine NGF was extracted and purified from mouse salivary glands as described previously (25Mobley W.C. Schenker A. Shooter E.M.

The anti-phospho-ERK (E10) monoclonal antibody and the anti-phospho-glycogen synthase kinase-3 polyclonal antibody were purchased from New England Biolabs. The human medulloblastoma cell line MED283 was grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, and antibiotics (50 units/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin) (27Friedman H.S.

PC12–615 cells, derived from PC12 cells stably transfected to overexpress trk by 15–20-fold (28Hempstead B.L. Rabin S.J. Kaplan L. Reid S. Parada L.F. Kaplan D.R. Neuron. 1992; 9: 883-896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% heat-inactivated horse serum, 5% fetal bovine serum, and antibiotics (50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mg/ml G418) (29Loeb D.M.

Retroviral vectors pLNCX carrying human TrkA wild-type, TrkA Y490F, TrkA Y785F, TrkA YY490/785FF, TrkA K538N, and TrkA ΔKFG (8Stephens R.M. Loeb D.M. Copeland T.D. Pawson T. Greene L.A. Kaplan D.R.

Stephens (NCI-Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center, National Institutes of Health). To generate replication-deficient retroviruses, these vectors were individually transfected into the Bing packaging cell line by the calcium phosphate technique as described previously (31Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2306) Google Scholar). Two days later, virus-containing supernatant from these cells was used to infect MED283 cells in the presence of 4 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma). Selection was initiated 3 days postinfection by including G418 (0.8 mg/ml; Life Technologies, Inc.) in the culture medium. After approximately 4–6 weeks, surviving colonies were pooled, expanded, and screened for TrkA protein expression by Western blotting. Replication-deficient adenoviruses bearing the N17Ras construct from G. M. Cooper (Harvard Medical School) were generated using the Adeno-Quest system (Quantum Biotechnologies) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, transfer vector containing the Ad5CMV viral backbone DNA and bearing cDNAs for N17Ras and green fluorescence protein (GFP) or GFP alone were co-transfected into human embryonic kidney 293 cells by a standard calcium phosphate technique. After transfection, 1.25% agarose overlay was added to each 6-cm dish every 4–5 days until cytopathic effects were observed. Immunocytochemistry and Western blotting using the anti-Ras monoclonal antibody Y13–259 identified recombinant viruses. Following amplification and cesium chloride purification, the viruses were stored at −80 °C at a concentration of 108 to 109 plaque-forming units per ml in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% sucrose. For infections, MED283 cells were transduced at a multiplicity of infection of 10 for 2 h and then further incubated in growth medium overnight prior to NGF stimulation. ERK kinase assays were carried out essentially as described previously (32Giasson B.I. Mushynski W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30404-30409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed once in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed lysis buffer (50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 0.2% Nonidet-P40, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.1 μg/ml leupeptin). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. ERK was immunoprecipitated from 250 μg of total protein using 5 μl of anti-ERK antibody and 20 μl of protein A/G-Sepharose suspension (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 3 h at 4 °C. The immunocomplexes were washed four times with lysis buffer and once with kinase buffer (30 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). Assays were initiated by adding to the sedimented beads, 20 μl of kinase buffer containing 10 μg of myelin basic protein (Sigma) and 50 μm[γ-32P]ATP (5 Ci/mmol). Reactions were terminated after 20 min at 30 °C by boiling for 5 min in SDS sample buffer. The samples were resolved on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and quantitated by a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) for γ-32P incorporation. The Akt kinase assays were performed using a glycogen synthase kinase-3 fusion protein substrate according to the manufacturer's protocol (Akt kinase assay kit, New England Biolabs). PLC-γ phosphorylation assay was carried out essentially as described previously (8Stephens R.M. Loeb D.M. Copeland T.D. Pawson T. Greene L.A. Kaplan D.R. Neuron. 1994; 12: 691-705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed once in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.1 μg/ml leupeptin). After 10 min on ice, the lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 ×g for 10 min in 4 °C. Samples normalized for total protein content (1 mg) were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-PLC-γ antibody for 2 h at 4 °C. Precipitates were collected with protein A/G-Sepharose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and washed three times with cold Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. The immunoprecipitates were boiled in SDS sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% w/v SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% w/v bromphenol blue) for 5 min. Western blotting was carried out using anti-phosphotyrosine antibody as described below. Cells were washed once in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in SDS sample buffer. After brief sonication, samples were heated to 95 °C for 5 min. Equal amounts of protein were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After electrophoretic transfer, nitrocellulose membranes were blocked with 5% dry milk/Tris-buffered saline for 1 h and incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibody in 5% milk/Tris buffered saline. Following three washes with 0.1% Tween 20/Tris-buffered saline, blots were incubated with secondary antibody at room temperature for 1 h. Blots were developed using a chemiluminescence system (NEN Life Science Products). To visualize DNA fragmentation, 2 × 106 cells were lysed in 350 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, 20 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, pH 8.0) for 15 min on ice and centrifuged at 4 °C for 15 min at 13,000 × g. The cleared lysate was then incubated with 0.2 mg/ml proteinase K at 55 °C for at least 2 h, followed by two sequential extractions with equal volumes of phenol/chloroform (pH 8.0). Following overnight ethanol precipitation and centrifugation, the pellets were dissolved in water containing 5 μg/ml DNase-free RNase at 37 °C for 1 h. Fragmented DNA was resolved by electrophoresis at 6 V/cm for 2 h in 2% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. Cell viability was assayed using the colorimetric 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)2H-tetrazolium (MTS) assay with the electron coupling reagent phenazine methosulfate according to the manufacturer's protocol (CellTiter 96 AQ, Promega). We initially examined the pattern of tyrosine phosphorylation in whole-cell lysates from MED283-TrkA cells and PC12–615 cells, because distinct proteins become tyrosine-phosphorylated following NGF stimulation in PC12 cells (28Hempstead B.L. Rabin S.J. Kaplan L. Reid S. Parada L.F. Kaplan D.R. Neuron. 1992; 9: 883-896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The PC12–615 cell line is derived from PC12 cells stably transfected to overexpress TrkA at a significantly higher level than both the parent PC12 cell line and MED283-TrkA cell line (24Muragaki Y. Chou T.T. Kaplan D.R. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 530-542Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We used this cell line as a basis for comparison in order to rule out any difference in protein tyrosine phosphorylation that may be attributed simply to TrkA overexpression. To determine the pattern of NGF-induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation in MED283-TrkA cells, we examined Western blots of total lysates prepared from MED283-TrkA cells treated with NGF for various lengths of time using the anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody 4G10. We found that tyrosine phosphorylation in MED283-TrkA cells peaked rapidly at 5 min following NGF treatment and then rapidly declined to basal level 30 min after exposure (Fig. 1). Unlike PC12–615 cells, the overall level of tyrosine phosphorylation of which peaked at 1 h post-NGF stimulation, the MED283-TrkA cells underwent a second wave of tyrosine phosphorylation that peaked at least 24 h after NGF treatment. Because NGF-induced apoptosis and tyrosine phosphorylation can be blocked by K-252a, a potent inhibitor of Trk tyrosine kinases (24Muragaki Y. Chou T.T. Kaplan D.R. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 530-542Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Berg M.M. Sternberg D.W. Parada L.F. Chao M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13-16Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), these findings suggest that NGF activates an apoptotic signaling pathway in the MED283-TrkA cells through a TrkA tyrosine kinase-dependent mechanism. Previous reports demonstrate that signaling pathways induced by activation of the TrkA receptor are mediated in part by mechanisms involving the binding of substrate proteins to tyrosine-phosphorylated sites (7Obermeier A. Lammers R. Wiesmuller K.H. Jung G. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22963-22966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Stephens R.M. Loeb D.M. Copeland T.D. Pawson T. Greene L.A. Kaplan D.R. Neuron. 1994; 12: 691-705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). This prompted us to identify phosphorylation sites on TrkA that may play a critical role in NGF-induced apoptosis. To do so, we engineered MED283 cells to express wild-type TrkA or TrkA receptor mutants with deficiencies in specific signaling capabilities. Retroviral transfection of MED283 cells generated stable cell lines that expressed comparable levels of wild-type and mutant TrkA proteins (Fig. 2 A). In vitro ERK kinase assays demonstrated that only mutations involving both tyrosines 490 and 785 (Y490F/Y785F) reduced NGF-mediated ERK activation (Fig. 2 B). Because the double mutant did not completely abolish ERK activation, other binding sites such as KFG may also be involved in redundant ERK signaling. In contrast, mutation at tyrosine 490 (Tyr-490) or at tyrosine 785 (Tyr-785) had negligible effects on ERK activation. These results are similar to data from Stephens et al. (8Stephens R.M. Loeb D.M. Copeland T.D. Pawson T. Greene L.A. Kaplan D.R. Neuron. 1994; 12: 691-705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar) in PC12 cells. Thus, the putative SHC and PLC-γ binding sites, tyrosine 490 and tyrosine 785, respectively, both contribute to ERK activation in MED283 cells, as well as other sites, such as KFG, because the double mutant still retained partial activity (8Stephens R.M.

Neuron. 1995; 15: 395-406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous observations that SHC is also critical to phosphotidylinositide 3-OH kinase activation following NGF stimulation (11Hallberg B. Ashcroft M. Loeb D.M. Kaplan D.R. Downward J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 691-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), the activity of the phosphotidylinositide 3-OH kinase pathway as measured by Akt kinase assays required phosphorylation of tyrosine 490 (Fig. 2 C). In contrast, tyrosine phosphorylation of immunoprecipitated PLC-γ was not affected by mutation at tyrosine 490 but was abolished by mutation at tyrosine 785 (Fig. 2 D). When these transfected cells were then treated with NGF for 72 h and examined for DNA fragmentation, we observed that cells expressing wild-type TrkA receptors as well as the TrkA mutants with a Y490F or a Y785F substitution underwent massive apoptosis (Fig. 2 E). However, cells expressing the kinase inactive TrkA mutant (L538N) and the double TrkA mutant (Y490F/Y785F) receptors failed to undergo apoptosis and failed to exhibit the delayed second phase of tyrosine phosphorylation (data not shown). The similarity between the pathways described above for NGF-induced apoptosis in MB cells and those leading to NGF-induced PC12 cell differentiation (8Stephens R.M. Loeb D.M. Copeland T.D. Pawson T. Greene L.A. Kaplan D.R. Neuron. 1994; 12: 691-705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar) led us to hypothesize that NGF may simultaneously activate conflicting growth and differentiation signaling mechanisms in MB cells with the end result being apoptosis. If this mechanism is correct, then TrkA mutations that render this receptor unable to signal cell cycle arrest in PC12 cells should also be unable to induce apoptosis. Because the mutant TrkA with a KFG sequence deletion is unable to initiate cell cycle arrest in PC12 cells (30Peng X. Greene L.A. Kaplan D.R. Stephens R.M. Neuron. 1995; 15: 395-406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), we examined whether or not MED283 cells expressing this mutant receptor would be protected from NGF-induced apoptosis. Cells expressing the ΔKFG mutant underwent apoptosis comparable to wild-type TrkA (Fig. 3), suggesting that cell cycle arrest may not be critical for the induction of apoptosis by NGF in these MB cells. In summary, the results from these experiments demonstrate an essential role for the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues at position 490 and 785 on TrkA in mechanisms of NGF-induced apoptosis. In addition, they suggest that binding of either SHC or PLC-γ to TrkA may be necessary for downstream activation of apoptotic machinery in MB cells. Because both tyrosines 490 and 785 mediate signaling through the Ras-ERK pathway, we examined the role of Ras-ERK signaling in NGF-induced apoptosis. Because we could not generate stable clones of MED283-TrkA cells that expressed dominant negative N17Ras (34Feig L.A. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2472-2478Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) by retroviral transfection, we sought to transiently express N17Ras in MED283-TrkA cells using adenoviruses. Cells infected with adenoviruses at a multiplicity of infection of 10 resulted in the expression of N17Ras or GFP at nearly a 100% infection rate as monitored by immunocytochemistry (data not shown). Overexpression of N17Ras completely eliminated ERK phosphorylation at 5 min and 24 h following NGF treatment (Fig. 4 A). In contrast, cells infected with adenoviruses expressing GFP alone showed robust ERK phosphorylation at 5 min following NGF treatment. Significantly, cells infected with N17Ras were partially protected from NGF-induced apoptosis, as evidenced by a decrease in the extent of DNA fragmentation and an increase in cell viability (Fig. 4, Band C). Taken together, these data indicate that suppression of endogenous Ras activity diminishes the extent of apoptosis induced by treating MB cells with NGF. Thus, Ras plays a critical role in the apoptotic pathways that are induced by NGF-mediated activation of TrkA receptors in MB cells. To investigate whether NGF-induced apoptosis was influenced by signaling through the major MEK/ERK pathway (10Wood K.W. Sarnecki C. Roberts T.M. Blenis J. Cell. 1992; 68: 1041-1050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 35Thomas S.M. DeMarco M. D'Arcangelo G. Halegoua S. Brugge J.S. Cell. 1992; 68: 1031-1040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar), we monitored cell viability and apoptosis in MED283-TrkA cells pretreated with the specific inhibitors of MEK PD98059 (50 μm) or U0126 (10 μm) (36Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3259) Google Scholar, 37Favata M.F. Horiuchi K.Y. Manos E.J. Daulerio A.J. Stradley D.A. Feeser W.S. Van Dyk D.E. Pitts W.J. Earl R.A. Hobbs F. Copeland R.A. Magolda R.L. Scherle P.A. Trzaskos J.M. J Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18623-18632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2754) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated ERK from untreated and treated cells was used to phosphorylate myelin basic protein in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP to confirm the inhibition of MEK by PD98049 (Fig. 5 A) and U0126 (data not shown) in MED283-TrkA cells. NGF-induced ERK phosphorylation was inhibited by pretreating cells with PD098059 or U0126. However, neither PD98059 (Fig. 5, B and C) nor U0126 (data not shown) affected cell viability and apoptosis, as shown by MTS and DNA fragmentation assays. Similar results were obtained when medium containing PD98059 or U0126 was changed every 12 h (data not shown). Thus, we conclude from these studies that the induction of apoptosis by NGF in MED283-TrkA cells is mechanistically linked to Ras activation but not to the major MEK/ERK-dependent signaling pathway. Because caspases, a family of cysteine proteases that specifically cleave proteins after Asp residues, have been implicated in signaling pathways that regulate the initiation of apoptotic cell death mechanisms (38Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6182) Google Scholar), we investigated whether or not caspase activation was involved in NGF-induced apoptosis in MED283-TrkA cells. To do this, we examined the effects of BAF, a general caspase inhibitor (39Slee E.A. Zhu H. Chow S.C. MacFarlane M. Nicholson D.W. Cohen G.M. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 21-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar), on the extent of DNA fragmentation associated with apoptosis of the MED283-TrkA cells following NGF treatment. As shown in Fig. 6, BAF (20 μm) completely inhibited DNA fragmentation in NGF-treated samples, and it also inhibited background DNA fragmentation in untreated controls. These results demonstrate an essential role of caspases in DNA fragmentation in NGF-induced as well as background apoptosis in MB cells. The data presented here indicate that NGF activates the TrkA receptor and induces apoptosis in MB cells through activation of a novel Ras-dependent pathway (Fig. 7). We showed that the elimination of both of the tyrosine residues that are specific interaction sites for SHC and PLC-γ in TrkA resulted in a functionally defective receptor, thereby linking these tyrosine residues to critical events in the apoptotic signaling pathways that are initiated by NGF treatment. The requirement of Tyr-490 and Tyr-785 does not imply that activation of SHC or PLC-γ alone is sufficient to induce apoptosis because other substrates may also bind to these tyrosines and collaborate to induce apoptosis, such as fibroblast growth factor receptor substrate-2/SNT (8Stephens R.M.

Neuron. 1995; 15: 395-406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). However, this is not likely given the Ras dependence of TrkA-mediated apoptosis, and mutation of the fibroblast growth factor receptor substrate-2 binding site did not prevent apoptosis. The data presented here also indicate that the common Ras effector MEK is not required for NGF-induced apoptosis, indicating that a novel pathway activated through Ras or Raf is important for this process. This result is consistent with a report from Kim et al.(40Kim J.Y. Sutton M.E. Lu D.J. Cho T.A. Goumnerova L.C. Goritchenko L. Kaufman J.R. Lam K.K. Billet A.L. Tarbell N.J. Wu J. Allen J.C. Stiles C.D. Segal R.A. Pomeroy S.L. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 711-719PubMed Google Scholar), who also demonstrated that ERK activation, but not p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, is also dispensable in NT-3-induced apoptosis in a trkC-expressing MB cell line. Preliminary results in our laboratory suggest that the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway may play a role in NGF-induced apoptosis as well. These results suggest the likelihood of a common pathway in the mechanism leading to NGF- and NT-3-induced apoptosis in MBs. Ras signaling is typically associated with cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. However, activated Ras may also increase cellular sensitivity to signals that induce apoptosis. For example, mice deficient in p120 GTPase-activating protein, a negative regulator of Ras, display a striking increase in the apoptotic death of cells in the anterior neural tube and cranial neural crest (41Henkemeyer M. Rossi D.J. Holmyard D.P. Puri M.C. Mbamalu G. Harpal K. Shih T.S. Jacks T. Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 377: 695-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Conceivably, medulloblastomas may recapitulate some properties of these cells and thereby undergo apoptosis upon Ras activation. In fibroblasts immortalized with the activated c-myc oncogene, oncogenic Ras is an effective promoter of apoptosis through Raf (42Kauffmann-Zeh A. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Ulrich E. Gilbert C. Coffer P. Downward J. Evan G. Nature. 1997; 385: 544-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar). The results presented here share many features with oncogenic Ras-induced apoptosis. First, oncogenic-Ras initiated apoptosis in fibroblasts that overexpress c-myc is p53-independent (43Mayo M.W. Wang C.Y. Cogswell P.C. Rogers-Graham K.S. Lowe S.W. Der C.J. Baldwin A.S.J. Science. 1997; 278: 1812-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). NGF-induced apoptosis is also p53-independent because the Daoy MB cell line carries an inactivating p53 mutation but nevertheless undergoes apoptosis in response to NGF (24Muragaki Y. Chou T.T. Kaplan D.R. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 530-542Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, inactivation of NF-κB induction by cycloheximide exacerbates apoptosis in both systems (43Mayo M.W. Wang C.Y. Cogswell P.C. Rogers-Graham K.S. Lowe S.W. Der C.J. Baldwin A.S.J. Science. 1997; 278: 1812-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Third, c-Myc cooperates with Ras to induce apoptosis in transformed fibroblasts, and MB cell lines in vitro tend to express high levels of c-myc or demonstrate c-myc amplification, including the MED283 cell line (44Bigner S.H. Friedman H.S. Vogelstein B. Oakes W.J. Bigner D.D. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 2347-2350PubMed Google Scholar, 45Bruggers C.S. Tai K.F. Murdock T. Sivak L. Le K. Perkins S.L. Coffin C.M. Carroll W.L. J. Pediatr. Hematol. Oncol. 1998; 20: 18-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). And fourth, PD98059 fails to prevent apoptosis in both systems (42Kauffmann-Zeh A. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Ulrich E. Gilbert C. Coffer P. Downward J. Evan G. Nature. 1997; 385: 544-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar). Because oncogenic Ras-mediated apoptosis is also Raf-dependent and MEK-independent (42Kauffmann-Zeh A. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Ulrich E. Gilbert C. Coffer P. Downward J. Evan G. Nature. 1997; 385: 544-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar), it would be important to determine the role of Raf in NGF-induced apoptosis as well. In summary, this work demonstrates a novel role for Ras that is independent of MEK/ERK in NGF-induced apoptosis and highlights a potential strategy of modulating this pathway for treatment of MBs. We suggest that this apoptotic pathway could play a role in the initiation and/or progression of MBs, as well as other neural tumors, and that it also may be one of several neurotrophin responses that regulate the normal development, maturation, or senescence of the nervous system.

The roles of any specific amino acids or domains of Sec61p are largely undefined, despite the number of functions attributed to this translocon component. A region of yeast Sec61p including transmembrane domain (TM) 6, TM7, and TM8 (residues Leu232–Arg406) has been shown to interact with Sss1p (23Wilkinson B.M. Esnault Y. Craven R.A. Skiba F.

Here, we describe two novel deletion alleles, sec61-Δ2 andsec61-Δ3, in which TM2 or TM3 containing regions of Sec61p have been deleted, respectively. Yeast strains expressing these alleles were viable and displayed defects in post-translational translocation. In addition the sec61-Δ3 mutant strain was induced for the unfolded protein response and had a defect in ER dislocation. These data suggest that the TM2/TM3 region of Sec61p plays a role in the post-translational translocation of preproteins and that in addition the TM3 region is required for the efficient dislocation of misfolded proteins. DNA restriction and modification enzymes were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. [35S]Methionine was from NEN Life Science Products.

Yeast strains were grown at 30 °C in YP medium (2% peptone, 1% yeast extract) containing either 2% glucose (YPD) or 2% galactose (YPGAL) or in minimal medium (0.67% yeast nitrogen base) with 2% glucose or galactose, plus appropriate supplements for selective growth. Solid media were supplemented with 2% Bacto-agar. All media were from Difco Laboratories. Growth rates were determined in YPD cultures at 30 °C with cell density monitored by A 600 nm using a CE292 spectrophotometer (Cecil Instruments, UK).

Extensive subculture on YPD medium was used to generate a Leu− strain (BWY308) that had lost pBW132. The same approach was used to generate aSEC61/sec61:: HIS3,SEC62/sec62-1 heterozygous diploid by crossing RDM50–94C with BWY67, with subculture on YPD medium to produce a Leu− strain (BWY341) lacking pBW11. Asec61::HIS3, sec62-1 haploid was generated by transformation of BWY341 with pBW7 to uracil prototrophy, followed by sporulation and dissection. Tetrads containing four viable spores were scored for temperature sensitivity (37 °C), Ura+/Ura− and the ability to remain Ura+ upon subculture on YPD medium. A temperature-sensitive, His+ spore that was stable for the Ura+ phenotype indicative of the presence of pBW7 in asec61::HIS3 background was named BWY343. SEC61 alleles were combined with the prc1-1allele encoding CPY* by transforming W303–1C with a SEC61plasmid, pBW7 and subsequently replacing the genomic SEC61with the sec61::HIS3 (null mutant) cassette as described previously (11Stirling C.J. Rothblatt J. Hosobuchi H. Deshaies R. Schekman R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 129-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). His+ transformants were confirmed as correct by their inability to grow on 5-FOA medium and hence the inability to survive without the SEC61 plasmid. The wild type and deletion allele plasmids pBW11, pBW132, and pBW134 (see below) were transformed into one such transformant (BWY402) and shuffled into the null mutant background on 5-FOA medium to produce strains BWY403–405. DNA manipulations were carried out according to standard protocols (34Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out as described previously (14Wilkinson B.M. Critchley A.J. Stirling C.J. J. Biol.

The UPRE-lacZ reporter cassette present in strain CS165 (Table I) was recovered by gap repair.Nae1/BamHI-digested pRS314 was transformed into CS165, and Trp+ transformants were selected. Plasmid isolates recovered in E. coli (36Hoffman C.S. Winston R. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 57: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (2040) Google Scholar) from these transformants contained the expected 4.2-kilobase pair repaired insert.HindIII digestion of one of these isolates yielded a fragment containing the UPRE-lacZ cassette, which was ligated into HindIII-digested pRS316 (CEN,URA3) to make pJT30. Low copy number LEU2 plasmids (pRS315 based) encoding deletions of Sec61p were constructed using a series ofBamHI sites produced by substitution in SEC61(14Wilkinson B.M. Critchley A.J. Stirling C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25590-25597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Deletions were made by excision of the singleBamHI/XhoI fragment from a given BamHI mutant of SEC61, followed by replacement with aBamHI/XhoI fragment from a downstreamBamHI mutant to create an in-frame fusion. The following deletion alleles were constructed with nucleotide co-ordinates (numbered from the SEC61 start codon) given for theBamHI sites used together with the amino acid junction (each Gly-Ser pair corresponding to the BamHI site):sec61-Δ2 (211, 316; L70-GS-K108), sec61-Δ3(316, 424; P105-GS-D144), sec61-Δ4 (424, 532; A141-GS-G180), sec61-Δ5 (532, 688; L177-GS-L232),sec61-Δ6 (688, 796; K229-GS-P268), sec61-Δ7(796, 1054; Y265-GS-D354), sec61-Δ8 (1054, 1219; S351-GS-S409), sec61-Δ9 (1219, 1303; R406-GS-D437),sec61-Δ2/3 (211, 424; L70-GS-D144),sec61-Δ3/4 (316, 532: P105-GS-G180),sec61-Δ4/5 (424, 688; A141-GS-L232),sec61-Δ5/6 (532, 796; L177-GS-P268),sec61-Δ6/7 (688, 1054; K229-GS-E354),sec61-Δ7/8 (796, 1219; Y265-GS-S409),sec61-Δ8/9 (1054, 1303; S351-GS-D437), andsec61-Δ9/10 (1219, 1303; R406-GS-W469). The plasmids encoding the sec61-Δ2, sec61-Δ3 andsec61-Δ2/3 alleles were named pBW134, pBW132, and pBW140, respectively. Preparation of radiolabeled yeast cell extracts was carried out as described previously (11Stirling C.J. Rothblatt J. Hosobuchi H. Deshaies R. Schekman R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 129-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). 2.0 A 600 nm unit equivalents of cell extract were added to saturating amounts of antiserum followed by with rotation for 4 h at room temperature. Protein A-Sepharose CL4B beads (Sigma) at 20% suspension in IP buffer (1.25% Triton X-100, 187.5 mm NaCl, 6.25 mm EDTA, 62.5 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4) were added at 5 μl/1 μl of antiserum with further incubation at room temperature for 2 h. Beads were pelleted in a microcentrifuge and washed three times with 1 ml of IP buffer. The addition of 40 μl of SDS sample buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol and heating to 95 °C for 5 min was used to dissociate antigen from the beads. DPAPB antiserum was raised using an hexahistidine-tagged C-terminal portion of DPAPB. For this purpose, a 3.4-kilobase pairSspI/XbaI fragment derived from pRG1 (37Roberts C.J. Pohlig G. Rothman J.H. Stevens T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1363-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) was subcloned into pET16b (Novagen), to create an in-frame fusion between 10 His residues and residues 200–642 of DPAPB under the control of the T7 promoter. The fusion protein was expressed and purified as described previously for His-tagged proteins (14Wilkinson B.M. Critchley A.J. Stirling C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25590-25597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Eluted protein fractions were pooled and subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. A band corresponding to the 77-kDa His-tagged protein was excised, crushed, and provided an antigen to inoculate sheep at the Scottish Antibody Production Unit (Lanark, Scotland). Antisera were tested by immunoblotting whole cell extracts detecting a ∼124-kDa species and a 97-kDa species after tunicamycin treatment consistent with both the mature and unglycosylated forms of the protein (37Roberts C.J. Pohlig G. Rothman J.H. Stevens T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1363-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The CPY antiserum will be described in another manuscript. 2W. Cui and C. J. Stirling, manuscript in preparation. Yeast cells were grown at 30 °C in minimal medium containing 2% glucose and appropriate supplements. Cultures were diluted to A 600 nmof 0.2 and grown for a further 4 h. 0.5A 600 nm units of cells were removed to a 15-ml tube, and the volume was adjusted to 1.35 ml with minimal medium. 150 μl of 10× Z buffer (38Kippert F. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 128: 201-206PubMed Google Scholar) containing 2% Sarcosyl NL-30 was added, and the sample was shaken gently at 30 °C for 30 min. 375 μl ofO-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside solution (4 mg/ml in 1× Z buffer) was added with further incubation at 30 °C for 30 min. 1 ml Na2CO3 solution was added to stop the reaction, and 1 ml was removed to a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube and cleared by centrifugation for 2 min at 14,000 × g. The A 420 nm of 0.9 ml of cleared sample was recorded using a CE292 spectrophotometer (Cecil Instruments). Several observations support the suggestion that TM2 may have a crucial role in Sec61p function. Firstly, multiple alignment of all eukaryotic Sec61p sequences and the more distantly related bacterial SecY homologues reveals the overall conservation of just three residues corresponding to Gly81, Pro84, and Gln93 of S. cerevisiae Sec61p (39Stirling C.J. Brown A.J.P. Tuite M.F. McCarthy J.E.G. Protein Synthesis and Targeting in Yeast. 71. NATO Series H, Cell Biology, Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Germany1993: 293-305Google Scholar, 40Broughton J. Swennen D. Wilkinson B.M. Joyet P. Gaillardin C. Stirling C.J. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2715-2727Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) all located in TM2 (Fig. 1 A). Secondly, during Sec61p assembly into the ER membrane, TM2 appears to be unable to act as a stop-transfer domain, possibly because of its limited hydrophobicity, and requires a downstream region for its membrane integration (14Wilkinson B.M. Critchley A.J. Stirling C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25590-25597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that specific residues that contribute to the limited hydrophobicity of TM2 have been conserved because they are crucial for some aspect of Sec61p function. In addition, cross-linking studies suggest a role for TM2 in binding the signal sequence of ppαF at an early sep in its translocation (24Plath K. Mothes W. Wilkinson B.M. Stirling C.J. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1998; 94: 795-807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of TM2 in Sec61p function, we used site-directed mutagenesis to change the conserved residue Gln93 to Leu93. When this mutation was shuffled into a SEC61 null mutant (Δsec61) background on a low copy plasmid, the cells grew without any discernible growth phenotype (data not shown). Given this rather surprising finding, we used BamHI sites previously introduced into theSEC61 sequence to construct a deletion allele (sec61-Δ2) lacking 35 residues (Asn73-Ser107) of Sec61p including TM2 (Fig. 1 A). A low copy plasmid encoding sec61-Δ2(pBW134) was introduced into a wild type strain to examine the expression of the mutant protein (Sec61Δ2p). The Sec61Δ2p was identified as a relatively poorly expressed species by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 2 A, lane 3). When the plasmid was introduced into BWY47, a haploid strain permitting the analysis of sec61 mutations by complementation of the sec61::HIS3(Δsec61) null allele (14Wilkinson B.M. Critchley A.J. Stirling C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25590-25597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), the sec61-Δ2allele was found to complement the growth defect of the null mutant as efficiently as SEC61 expressed from a low copy plasmid (Fig. 2 B). Plasmid pBW134 was subsequently shuffled into theΔsec61 background by passage of the BWY47 transformant on 5-FOA medium to counter-select the URA3 plasmid pBW62. The expression of Sec61Δ2p was examined in the resulting strain, BWY98,by immunoblot analysis. The mutant protein was now found to be expressed at a level comparable with wild type Sec61p (Fig. 2 A,lanes 6 and 7), suggesting that it is stabilized when present as the only functional source of Sec61p. We considered the possibility that TM3 may act in concert with TM2 not only during their membrane assembly but also in Sec61p function. We addressed this by taking the same approach as described above for TM2 and constructed a sec61-Δ3 allele that removed 36 residues (Lys108–Ser143) including TM3 immediately downstream of the TM2 deletion (Fig. 1 A). The Sec61Δ3p species was also expressed at a low level in a wild type background (Fig. 2 A, lane 4). The sec61-Δ3allele could complement the null mutant (Fig. 2 B), and after plasmid shuffling to generate BWY97, the expression level of Sec61Δ3p was also dramatically raised (Fig. 2 A, lane 8). Because either the TM2 or the TM3 region of Sec61p can be deleted without loss of function, we went on to test a deletion of residues Asn73–Ser143 equivalent to a combination of both deletions. The level of Sec61Δ2/3p expressed by thissec61-Δ2/3 allele was again poor relative to wild type (Fig. 2 A, lane 5). However, thesec61-Δ2/3 allele could not complement theΔsec61 mutant (Fig. 2 B). We have previously shown that sec61 alleles expressing the following deletions that removed the TMs shown in parentheses are nonfunctional: ΔPhe13–Ser72 (TM1); ΔPhe13–Ser107 (TM1/TM2); ΔAsp437–Phe468 (TM10); and ΔSer409–Phe468 (TM9/TM10) (23Wilkinson B.M.

To extend this study, we constructed a series of deletion alleles individually encompassing the remaining transmembrane domains and adjacent pairs of domains (see “Experimental Procedures”"
https://openalex.org/W2054566408,"To study the oncogenic activity of cyclin E in an in vivo system we generated transgenic mice expressing high levels of cyclin E in T-lymphocytes by using a construct containing the CD2 locus control region. These animals were neither predisposed to develop any tumors spontaneously nor showed an increased incidence when crossbred with Emu L-myc transgenic mice but developed hyperplasia in peripheral lymphoid organs at later age with an incidence of 27%. When treated with the DNA methylating carcinogen N-methylnitrosourea (MNU) that provokes the development of T-cell lymphomas, CD2-cyclin E transgenic animals came down with T-cell neoplasia showing a significant higher incidence (54%) than normal non transgenic controls (31%). In one of eight tumors that arose in normal MNU treated mice we could find an expected activating point mutation in the Ki-ras gene (12.5%). In contrast, the same mutation occurred in five of 16 tumors from CD2-cyclin E transgenic mice (31.2%). Whereas cyclin E overexpression alone did not lead to an increased CDK2 activity we observed in all tumors that emerged from either MNU treated normal mice or treated CD2-cyclin E transgenics a downregulation of p27KIP1 and a higher histone H1 kinase activity in CDK2 immunoprecipitates compared to normal tissue. These findings demonstrate that high level expression of cyclin E can predispose T-cells for hyperplasia and malignant transformation. However, the results also suggest that this activity of cyclin E is manifest only when other cooperating oncogenes in particular ras genes are present and activated. This would be consistent with our previous finding that cyclin E and Ha-Ras cooperate in focus formation assays in rat embryo fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W2317537627,"Tumorigenesis is a multistep process that involves the activation of oncogenes and the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes. The transforming activity of the v-Abl oncogene of Abelson murine leukemia virus (A-MuLV) in immortal cell lines has been well studied, while the effects of v-Abl in primary fibroblasts are less clear. Here we show that v-Abl causes cell cycle arrest in primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and elevated levels of both p53 and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21Cip. p53-/- or p19ARF-/- MEFs were resistant to v-Abl-induced cell cycle arrest. Although wild-type MEFs were resistant to v-Abl transforming activity, p53-/- or p19ARF-/- MEFs were susceptible. The results indicate that loss of p19ARF and p53 function plays an important role during the transformation of primary cells by v-Abl. We suggest that although v-Abl is a potent oncogene, its full potential transforming activity cannot be realized until the ARF-, and p53-dependent growth inhibitory pathway is disabled. We also show that p53 is not the mediator of v-Abl toxicity in immortal fibroblasts and does not determine the susceptibility of immortal fibroblasts to v-Abl transformation."

https://openalex.org/W2048019456,"We have identified a novel p53 regulated gene designated DDA3 through differential mRNA display on IW32 erythroleukemia cells containing a temperature sensitive p53 allele, tsp53val-135. DDA3 mRNA induction could be observed in all sublines expressing tsp53val-135 cultured at permissive temperature as well as in NIH3T3 cells undergoing DNA damage. Upregulation of DDA3 could be detected within 2 h after down-shifting the temperature to 32.5°C; upon shifting back to 38.5°C, DDA3 mRNA rapidly degraded with a half-life of less than 2 h. Actinomycin D, but not cycloheximide, inhibited the p53 dependent DDA3 induction, suggesting that the activation is through transcriptional regulation and does not require de novo protein synthesis. DDA3 was expressed in multiple mouse tissues including brain, spleen, lung, kidney and testis. Full-length DDA3 cDNA was cloned and it contained an open reading frame predicted to encode a proline rich protein of 329 amino acids. Overexpression of DDA3 in H1299 lung carcinoma cells suppressed colony formation. These results suggest that DDA3 is a p53-regulated gene that might participate in the p53-mediated growth suppression."
https://openalex.org/W2002141689,"The immediate-early IE62 protein of varicella zoster virus is an acidic transcriptional activator capable of up-regulating many viral and cellular promoters with varying efficiencies. We demonstrate that, in the context of a minimal promoter, a TATA element is both sufficient and essential for IE62-mediated transcriptional activation. Differential levels of activation by IE62 in this context were conferred by a panel of naturally occurring sequence variations within the TATA motif itself. TATA motif-specific, differential induction was not obtained when the IE62 acidic activation domain was targeted as a GAL4 fusion protein to the same panel. The prototype acidic transactivator, VP16 of herpes simplex virus, failed to discriminate between these different TATA motifs when they were placed into an appropriate responsive promoter context. Nonetheless, a chimeric IE62 polypeptide substituted with the VP16 activation domain retained the ability to differentially modulate minimal promoters with various TATA motifs. Taken together with its binding to TATA box-binding protein (TBP) and transcription factor IIBin vitro, we suggest that IE62 has the unusual ability to achieve differential levels of transcriptional activation through different TATA motifs, which may be accomplished either directly or indirectly by recognizing conformational variations in DNA-bound TBP, TBP-transcription factor IIA/B, or TBP-TATA-associated factor complexes.

Taken together with its binding to TATA box-binding protein (TBP) and transcription factor IIBin vitro, we suggest that IE62 has the unusual ability to achieve differential levels of transcriptional activation through different TATA motifs, which may be accomplished either directly or indirectly by recognizing conformational variations in DNA-bound TBP, TBP-transcription factor IIA/B, or TBP-TATA-associated factor complexes. varicella zoster virus herpes simplex virus Epstein-Barr virus cytomegalovirus human cytomegalovirus TATA box-binding protein transcription factor TATA-associated factor interferon amino acid(s) base pair(s) nucleotide(s) glutathione S-transferase chloramphenicol acetyltransferase thymidine kinase 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid initiator major immediate-early Varicella zoster virus (VZV)1 causes chickenpox as a primary infection, and shingles as a reactivated infection. The lytic cycle of this virus begins with the expression of its major immediate-early protein, IE62, a DNA-bindingtrans-regulatory protein containing 1310 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular mass of 140 kDa (1Davison A.J Scott J.E. J. Gen. Virol. 1986; 67: 2279-2286Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). IE62 is a potent transactivator that stimulates transcription not only of target VZV genes, but also a variety of heterologous viral and cellular genes (2Inchauspe G. Nagpal S. Ostrove J.M. Virology. 1989; 173: 700-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar,3Perera L.P. Mosca J.D. Ruyechan W.T. Hay J. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 5298-5304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although there is no definitive genetic proof as yet that IE62 is essential for VZV replication, its ability to regulate the expression of VZV genes of all three putative kinetic classes (immediate-early, early, and late) as well as its sequence homology and functional similarity to the essential ICP4 transactivator of herpes simplex virus (HSV) argue that it serves a critical role in the VZV replicative cycle. Both VZV IE62 and HSV-1 ICP4 bind to specific ATCGTC DNA sequences at the cap site of their own promoters, and these interactions are thought to be involved primarily in negative transcriptional autoregulation. However, the mechanism by which these proteins up-regulate the transcription of responsive viral promoters has not yet been well defined.Accumulating evidence indicates that transcriptional activators, in general, enhance transcription by influencing or stabilizing functional interactions among the general transcription factors including TATA box-binding protein (TBP), TFIIA, and TFIIB, that are essential for the formation of a functional pre-initiation complex (reviewed in Refs.4Buratowski S.

Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 330-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In addition, the in vitro function of transcriptional activators requires a number of co-factors that are not essential for basal transcription in minimal reconstituted systems. Many of these co-factors are physically associated with the TBP polypeptide (TATA-associated factors or TAFs) and constitute the holoTFIID fraction along with TBP. Certain transactivators have been shown to interact specifically with TBP and one or more TAFs, and these interactions appear to function as molecular adapters that bridge between the transactivator and the general transcription initiation machinery and serve to recruit TBP and enhance a rate-limiting step in transcription (reviewed in Refs. 5Goodrich I.A. Cutler G. Tjian R. Cell. 1996; 84: 825-830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 8Sharp P.A.

Cell. 1994; 77: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar).An intriguing aspect of IE62 function is its capacity to activate intrans a diverse array of promoters that lack any apparent conserved motifs in their promoter and upstream regions (2Inchauspe G. Nagpal S. Ostrove J.M. Virology. 1989; 173: 700-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 3Perera L.P. Mosca J.D. Ruyechan W.T. Hay J. J.

In addition, the magnitude of responsiveness to IE62 varies widely from promoter to promoter. Curiously, in both HSV and VZV, most of the immediate-early and early class promoters tend to have classical close-to-consensus TATA motifs, whereas late class promoters typically have highly divergent, non-consensus (but still AT-rich) TATA-like motifs. Both types of promoters respond to IE62 and ICP4, although in HSV other accessory viral factors clearly contribute to both maximal and appropriate temporal responses of late promoters.Previous deletion analysis of the VZV IE62 promoter revealed that a minimal reporter construct possessing the TATA box with only 15 base pairs (bp) of adjacent upstream sequence retains responsiveness to IE62-mediated induction but not to its HSV homolog ICP4 (13Perera L.P. Mosca J.D. Sadeghi-Zadeh M. Ruyechan W.T. Hay J. Virology. 1992; 191: 346-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Because this upstream sequence lacks consensus recognition motifs for binding to IE62 or any other known transcription factors, we have focused our attention on the TATA element itself as a potential key factor in mediating the transcriptional effects of IE62. In this report, we present evidence to suggest that a novel TATA motif-dependent mechanism is both essential and sufficient for IE62-mediated transcriptional activation.DISCUSSIONThe VZV IE62 transcriptional regulatory protein possesses an unusual, TATA motif-dependent mechanism by which it mediates activation of simple, minimal eukaryotic promoter targets. Large variations in the levels of activation of various promoters tested were evident according to which particular TATA sequence was present in them. The one other viral transactivator known to activate minimal promoters via a TATA-dependent mechanism is the adenovirus E1A protein. E1A, however, exhibits an absolute requirement for one specific motif, namely TATAA, for transactivation to occur (44Simon M.C. Fisch T.M. Benecke B.J. Nevins J.R. Heintz N. Cell. 1988; 52: 723-729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar,45Wu L. D. Rosser S. Schmidt M.C. Berk A. Nature. 1987; 326: 512-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Similarly, the muscle-specific enhancer of the myoglobin gene has been shown to function in the presence of its cognate TATAAAA motif, but not with the TATTTAT element from the SV40 promoter (46Wefald F.C. Devlin B.H. Williams R.A. Nature. 1990; 344: 260-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The activity of cellular transcription factor ATF has also been shown to be sensitive to TATA motif changes (47Taylor I.C.A. Kingston R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 165-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).The results presented here argue that VZV IE62 acts primarily by a mechanism that does not involve or require upstream targeting sites or factors and that it is unusually sensitive to the nature of the specific TATA motifs present. Such a mechanism differs significantly from the strong and relatively specific requirements for upstream targeting by other well studied viral and eukaryotic transactivators. For example, HSV VP16, Ad2 E1A, and EBV Zta interact in vitro with TBP and TFIIB (and TAFs) through their activation domains, whereas VZV IE62 interacts with TBP and TFIIB through a region(s) that is distinct from its activation domain. VP16 and E1A principally target upstream sites through indirect protein:protein interactions with Oct-1, and Rb:E2F or ATF-2, respectively, whereas Zta binds directly to upstream ZRE motifs and acts as a bridge between these sites and TFIID, resulting in TFIIA-dependent stabilization of TBP binding to weak TATA motifs such as GATAAA (35Lieberman P.M. Berk A.J. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2441-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar,48Lieberman P.M. Berk A.J. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 995-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The HCMV IE1/IE2 transactivators are also clearly different from IE62 in that they target promoters lacking TATA motifs. Both HCMV IE2 and HSV ICP4 also interact with TBP and TFIIB in vitrothrough regions that are distinct from their activation domains (22Caswell R. Hagemeier C. Chiou C.J. Hayward G.S. Kouzarides T. Sinclair J. J. Gen. Virol. 1993; 74: 2691-2698Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar,49Smith C.A. Bates P. Rivera-Gonzalez R. Gu B. DeLuca N.A. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4676-4687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although ICP4 represses upstream activator-mediated transcription including that of Sp-I, presumably through formation of a tripartite complex consisting of TBP, TFIIB, and ICP4 itself, the activation induced by ICP4 correlates with its interaction with TFIID perhaps via TAF250 requiring the C terminus of ICP4 (49Smith C.A. Bates P. Rivera-Gonzalez R. Gu B. DeLuca N.A. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4676-4687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 50Carrozza M.J. DeLuca N.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3085-3093Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 51Gu B. Kuddus R. DeLuca N.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3618-3626Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). IE62 also differs from ICP4 in possessing a powerful N-terminal activator domain that functions effectively in a GAL4 fusion protein in comparison to a weak, promoter-specific modular activation domain recently reported in ICP4 (19Perera L.P. Mosca J.D. Ruyechan W.T. Hayward G.S. Straus S.E. Hay J. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4474-4483Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 52Xiao W. Pizer L.I. Wilcox K.W. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1757-1765Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, our previous work (13Perera L.P. Mosca J.D. Sadeghi-Zadeh M. Ruyechan W.T. Hay J. Virology. 1992; 191: 346-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) showing that the IE62 promoter positively responds to both ICP4 and IE62 indicates that the promoter elements required for activation by VZV IE62 and HSV ICP4 are different, a finding that was confirmed in the present study by the absence of activation of pIFNTATA by ICP4 (Fig. 1). While the TATA box is dispensable for ICP4-mediated activation of promoters, it does appear to influence the magnitude of activation such that it activates promoters with TATA boxes with low affinity for TBP more efficiently than those with high affinity for TBP (43Cook W.J. Gu B. DeLuca N.A. Moynihan E.B. Coen D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4998-5006Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The related pseudorabies virus IE180 protein also has been shown to activate suboptimally utilized promoters and contains an N-terminal activator domain (53Martin K.J. Lillie J.W. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 1991; 4: 2376-2382Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar), but VZV IE62 differs from it in that the TATA motif alone is a sufficient cis-acting element to mediate transactivation by IE62, but not by IE180 (54Rusconi T.M. Schaffner W. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar).Simon et al. (44Simon M.C. Fisch T.M. Benecke B.J. Nevins J.R. Heintz N. Cell. 1988; 52: 723-729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) showed that, despite similar binding to TFIID and in vitro functionality for the Ad MLP TATAAAA motif and the SV40 TATTTAT motif, only the former responds to E1A transactivation. In this regard, VZV IE62 resembles E1A, except that a much broader pattern of TATA motifs are recognized (i.e.weak or non-responsive for TTTTTAA and TATTTAAATT; moderately responsive for TATTTAA and TATTAAA; highly responsive for TATAAAA, TATATAA, and TATATATAA).The yeast GCN4 and GAL4 proteins (both acidic transactivators) also differ from IE62 in their ability to interact functionally with certain TATA motifs. In fact, this finding was originally used to invoke models for either two different TATA proteins or two types of acidic activator domains with different selectivities (55Harbury P.A. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5298-5304Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). All evidence at present however, points to there being only one universal TBP species.X-ray crystallographic and biochemical analyses indicate that TBP binds directionally to DNA as a monomer, but it exists in unbound form in solution as a stable homodimer (56Kim J.L. Burley S.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 638-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 57Burley S.K. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant.

Chem. 1995; 270: 13842-13849Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Unlike most DNA-binding transcription factors, TBP binds DNA in the minor groove in a two-step process (60Hoopes B.C. LeBlanc J.F. Hawley D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11539-11547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with relatively low discrimination of specific base pairs. In so doing TBP bends and conformationally distorts the helix, while undergoing conformational changes itself (56Kim J.L. Burley S.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 638-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 60Hoopes B.C. LeBlanc J.F. Hawley D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11539-11547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 61Giese K. Cox J. Grosschedl R. Cell. 1992; 69: 185-195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Dissociation of unbound dimers and of DNA-bound monomers of TBP are relatively slow processes compared with the rate of association of monomeric TBP with DNA (62Coleman R.A. Pugh B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13850-13859Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Stabilization of TBP binding to either TATA elements by TFIIA (and TFIIB) (48Lieberman P.M. Berk A.J. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 995-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 63Choy B. Green M.R. Nature. 1993; 366: 531-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 64Lee D.K. DeJong J. Hashimoto S. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5189-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), or to nonspecific DNA sequences by SP-1 and other upstream or Inr protein interactions in the case of TATA less promoters, are thought to be key rate-limiting steps in the formation and processing of initiation complexes. Indeed, binding between TBP and TFIIA has been found recently to be an essential step in transactivation by yeast acidic activator protein domains (9Stargell L.A. Struhl K. Science. 1995; 269: 75-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). TFIIA binding also appears to alter the conformation of bound TBP.Our EMSA results (Fig. 9) indicate that all of the TATA like motifs studied here (both consensus and non-consensus alike) exhibit similar affinity for TBP. These results closely resemble those obtained by Hahnet al. (41Hahn S. Buratowski S. Sharp P.A. Guarente L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5718-5722Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) for purified yeast holo-TFIID on larger DNA fragments by DNase I footprinting of a number of consensus and non-consensus TATA motifs. It seems, therefore, unlikely that either TBP or TBP-TAF complexes directly discriminate between different types of TATA motifs examined in this study. The highly uniform levels of transactivation of both our GAL4-responsive and VP16-responsive promoter panels containing different TATA motifs also suggest that neither basal levels (as supported by CAT activity and RNase protection data) nor upstream-element-mediated activation are influenced by particular TATA motifs in the panel tested. However, it could also be argued that the TATA motifs themselves become irrelevant when multiple upstream response elements are present so as to offset TATA box requirement for transcription by compensatory effects of other transcription factors binding to these upstream elements.Considering the inability of the TBP protein to discriminate significantly among the different TATA motif oligonucleotides used in our in vitro EMSA binding studies, it appears unlikely that TBP interactions with the TATA motif alone can directly account for the specificity of IE62 transactivation. Similarly, neither the GAL4 fusion proteins containing the IE62 N-terminal acidic activation domain, nor Oct-1/TAATGARAT-targeted intact VP16, could discriminate functionally between the different TATA motifs. It also appears unlikely that TATA specificity is attained directly through the properties of any particular subclass of general factors or acidic activator domains. Instead, these properties reside within the core non-activator domain segment of IE62 itself as indicated by our domain-swap experiment (Fig. 6). Although IE62 is also a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein, it preferentially recognizes consensus motifs containing ATCGTC elements, and it neither bound to the TATATAA oligonucleotide probes by EMSA in our work nor protected TATA motif regions in previous foot printing analyses (65Tyler J.K. Everett R.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 513-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The homologous HSV ICP4 protein has also been shown previously by EMSA and DNA footprinting assays to form a cooperative tripartite DNA-bound complex with TFIIB and TBP (or holo-TFIID), but only on a target DNA probe containing both a TATA motif and an ICP4 binding site (49Smith C.A. Bates P. Rivera-Gonzalez R. Gu B. DeLuca N.A. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4676-4687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we are left to conclude that a direct interaction between IE62 with TBP, most likely as a complex with TFIIA or TFIIB or with a specific TAF or co-activator (66Boyer T.G. Berk A.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1810-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), can recognize subtle conformational or stability differences (at either the DNA or protein level) that are imparted by particular base pair arrangements within the TATA motifs, and that these altered interactions manifest themselves as different levels of transactivation.Emerging evidence from in vivo studies in yeast with yTAFII145 implicate distinctions among different core promoters (67Shen W.-C. Apone L.M. Virbasuis C.-M.A. Li X.-Y. Monslave M. Green M.R. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant Biol. 1998; 63: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Our work reinforces this notion that there is a level of discrimination between different types of TATA motifs (particularly for transactivation) that is not currently understood. The VZV IE62 protein is particularly intriguing in this regard, because the effect occurs in the absence of upstream targeting motifs, and certain non-consensus TATA motifs, particularly TATTAAA, are sufficient to mediate activation. In addition, the ability of VZV IE62 to bind to TBPin vitro through an additional internal non-activator domain suggests that it combines the properties expected of both a transactivator and an adapter or co-activating factor. Varicella zoster virus (VZV)1 causes chickenpox as a primary infection, and shingles as a reactivated infection. The lytic cycle of this virus begins with the expression of its major immediate-early protein, IE62, a DNA-bindingtrans-regulatory protein containing 1310 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular mass of 140 kDa (1Davison A.J Scott J.E. J. Gen. Virol. 1986; 67: 2279-2286Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). IE62 is a potent transactivator that stimulates transcription not only of target VZV genes, but also a variety of heterologous viral and cellular genes (2Inchauspe G. Nagpal S. Ostrove J.M.

Although there is no definitive genetic proof as yet that IE62 is essential for VZV replication, its ability to regulate the expression of VZV genes of all three putative kinetic classes (immediate-early, early, and late) as well as its sequence homology and functional similarity to the essential ICP4 transactivator of herpes simplex virus (HSV) argue that it serves a critical role in the VZV replicative cycle.

Random variation in association creates a nonuniform ""fluorescent speckle"" pattern. Fluorescent speckle movements in time-lapse recordings stand out to the eye and can be measured. Because fluorescent speckles represent fiduciary marks on the polymer lattice, FSM provides the opportunity for the first time to see the 2- and 3-dimensional trajectories of lattice movements within large arrays of polymers as well as identifying sites of assembly and disassembly of individual polymers. The technique works with either microinjection of fluorescently labeled subunits or expression of subunits ligated to green fluorescent protein (GFP). We have found for microtubules assembled in vitro that speckles containing one fluorophore can be detected and recorded using a conventional wide-field epi-fluorescence light microscope and digital imaging with a low noise cooled CCD camera. In living cells, optimal speckle contrast occurs at fractions of labeled tubulin of approximately 0.1-0.5% where the fluorescence of each speckle corresponds to one to seven fluorophores per resolvable unit (approximately 0.27 microm) in the microscope. This small fraction of labeled subunits significantly reduces out-of-focus fluorescence and greatly improves visibility of fluorescently labeled structures and their dynamics in thick regions of living cells."

Transcription was done with T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of E. coli topoisomerase I and closed circular DNA. Positive stress was observed in hypotonic conditions or when one of the polyamines, spermidine or spermine, were present. Polycations such as polylysine, polyarginine, histone H1, histones H2A-H2B, and protamine were observed to induce minimal positive stress. It is known that polyamines influence DNA structure by causing both self-association and sequence-specific structural alterations (polyamine-induced localized bending). Experimental evidence indicates that the likely cause of the positive stress is the induced bending. In order to evaluate protein-mediated bending, transcription was done on nucleosomes. A minimum of three nucleosomes on a DNA of 6055 bp was sufficient to generate very high levels of positive stress. Histones H3-H4 in the absence of H2A-H2B were responsible for this effect. Since these histones by themselves are able to maintain negative coils on DNA, it is concluded that protein-mediated bending is yet another mechanism for placing rotational restriction on DNA.

As RNA polymerase transcribes the DNA, it opens 10–15 bp1 of DNA and would therefore be expected to rotate 360° for every 10.5 bp that is transcribed. However, as the length of the transcript increases, the rotational freedom of the polymerase decreases, and the DNA preferentially rotates. This rotation causes an overwinding of the helix in front of the polymerase (positive stress) and an underwinding of the helix in the wake of the polymerase (negative stress).

These studies indicate thatEscherichia coli topoisomerase I functions to remove negative stress and gyrase functions to remove positive stress by introducing negative coils in an energy-dependent process.E. coli topoisomerase I serves a critical role in maintaining an overall negative state in the DNA. This enzyme senses helical distortion (single-stranded character) in DNA that is caused by the transcription-induced negative stress (13Wang J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 55: 523-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 14Kung J. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 5398-5402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Kirkegaard K. Wang J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 185: 625-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The activity of this enzyme decreases rapidly as the DNA becomes increasingly relaxed and therefore provides a mechanism for maintenance of a basal level of negative stress. In vitro transcription studies on closed circular DNA have shown that when this enzyme is present, positive stress is produced on the template (8Tsao Y.P. Wu H-Y. Liu L.F. Cell. 1989; 56: 111-118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Various levels of positive stress have been observed as a result of restricting rotational freedom of both polymerase and DNA (9Ostrander E.A. Benedetti P. Wang J.C. Science. 1990; 249: 1261-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) or by immobilizing the nascent transcript (4Lodge J.K. Kazic T. Berg D.E. J.

Therefore, this topoisomerase has been shown to be an effective reagent for the quantitation of helical distortions, as observed by the accumulation of positive stress on DNA during transcription. In contrast to the topoisomerases of the prokaryote, the eukaryotic topoisomerases (I and II) relax both positively and negatively coiled DNA equally well. A number of studies have been done in yeast with deletion mutants of topoisomerase I and ts mutants of topoisomerase II that indicate that these proteins function in a similar way to remove topological stresses that are induced by transcription (18Brill S.J. Sternglanz R. Cell. 1988; 54: 403-411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 19Giaever G.N. Wang J.C.

In this instance, the presence of nucleosomes does not appear to alter the formation of these induced stresses. Indeed, the induced positive stress in advance of the polymerase may alter the structural state of the nucleosome (22Lee M-S. Garrard W.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 89: 11461-11465Google Scholar, 23Lee M-S. Garrard W.T. EMBO. J. 1991; 10: 607-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar); an alteration that may enhance transcription through them. It has also been suggested that the negative stress in the wake of the polymerase has an important role in facilitating activation of promoters, DNA replication, and recombination (reviewed in Refs. 24Cozzarelli N.R. Wang J.C. DNA Topology and Its Biological Effects. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar, 25Droge P. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 26Sinden R. DNA Structure and Function. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1994Google Scholar, 27Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2086) Google Scholar). It is therefore of interest to evaluate the parameters that facilitate the maintenance of transcription-induced stress. The in vitro experiments that have studied the induction of transcription-induced stress have used variable conditions of ionic strength or polyamine concentrations. We have evaluated these components further in order to define the process whereby positive stress is induced in template DNA when transcription is done in the presence of E. coli topoisomerase I. We conclude that a decrease in flexibility of DNA is a critical factor that is responsible for this effect. This decreased flexibility enhances the maintenance of transcription-induced stress in two ways as follows. 1) When reduced flexibility is present, the induced topological stress has a more profound effect on the helical state of the DNA. Any negative stress that is generated causes a greater helical distortion (single-stranded character), which can be rapidly removed by E. colitopoisomerase I. This reduced flexibility is observed during transcription in hypotonic conditions and in the presence of polyamines. 2) The reduced flexibility as exhibited with the polyamines also decreases the rotational freedom of DNA. Polyamines are known to stabilize alternative DNA structures (i.e. Z DNA) and facilitate sequence-specific bending (28Howell M.L. Schroth G.P. Ho P.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15373-15382Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 29Feurstein B.G. Pattabiraman N. Marton L.J.

Bloomfield V.A. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 3152-3164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The stabilized bending increases the effective diameter of DNA and restricts its rotation during transcription. These two effects, which are a consequence of reduced flexibility, enhance the maintenance of helical distortions and are required for E. coli topoisomerase I to remove the negative stress. We have also evaluated whether similar helical distortions could be produced in the presence of nucleosomes. We observe that as little as three nucleosomes in a plasmid capable of holding 30 nucleosomes will facilitate the formation of very high levels of positive stress. In this instance, a protein-mediated bending of DNA has increased the effective diameter of DNA and reduced its rotational freedom. Histones H3-H4 and not histones H2A-H2B were responsible for this reduced rotational rate, which is an indication that the presence of the stored negative coil is a primary determinate for this rotational restriction. Salmon protamine (grade X), poly-l-lysine (4–15 kDa), poly-l-arginine (5–15 kDa), poly(Asp-Glu) (7 kDa), spermine, spermidine, and protamine were purchased from Sigma. 1,19-Bis(ethylamino)-5,10,15-tirazanonadecane (BE-4-4-4-4) was a gift from Hirac Basu (University of Wisconsin, Madison). Histones were purified from chicken erythrocytes as described previously (33Brooks W. Jackson V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18155-18166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, histones H2A-H2B were separated from H3-H4 by elution from a hydroxylapatite column in which the chromatin had been immobilized. Elution was done with a 0.1 m NaCl step gradient between 0.6 and 2.0 m NaCl. The histones were pooled, concentrated on Amicon filters, and stored at −70 °C. Histone Hl was purified by a 0.6 m NaCl extraction of calf thymus chromatin that had been immobilized on hydroxylapatite. This extract was then treated with 5% perchloric acid in which H1 is preferentially soluble. The H1 was then extensively dialyzed against 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and stored at −70 °C. Topoisomerase I frequently contaminates H1 preparations when eluted from chromatin by NaCl. It is important to remove this activity when characterizing topological states. The perchloric acid extraction destroys this activity. Eukaryotic topoisomerase I was isolated from MSB cells (chicken leukemic cell line) using a modification (34Pfaffle P. Jackson V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16821-16829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of the procedure of Liu and Miller (35Liu L.F. Miller K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 3487-3491Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). One unit is defined as that quantity that achieves 100% relaxation of 0.5 μg of DNA in 30 min at 37 °C. This protein is referred to here as MSB topoisomerase I. Procaryotic topoisomerase I was isolated from a clone of E. coli topoisomerase I (pJW312; a gift of M. Gartenberg and J. C. Wang, Harvard). The procedure for isolation was as described previously (36Lynn R.M. Wang J.C. Protein Struct. Funct. Genet. 1989; 6: 231-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) except that after the final phosphocellulose column, the enzyme was further purified from DNase and RNase activity by collecting the flow-through from a Mono Q column and applying it to a Mono S column. The enzyme eluted in a 0–0.5 m KCl gradient. We have defined 1 unit of activity as the quantity that relaxes 1 μg of DNA from −0.05 superhelical density (SD) to −0.25 SD at 37 °C for 1 min. T7 RNA polymerase was prepared from E. coli strain BL 21, which contained plasmid pAR1219 (a gift of W. Studier and J. Dunn, Brookhaven National Laboratory). The enzyme was purified by the procedures of King et al. (37King G.C. Martin C.T. Pham T.T. Coleman J.E. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 36-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) except with modification as described previously (38Pfaffle P. Gerlach V. Bunzel L. Jackson V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16830-16840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One unit is defined as that amount of enzyme that will incorporate 1 nmol of CTP at 37 °C for 60 min. Nuclear assembly protein 1 (NAP1) was prepared from E. colistrain BL21, which contained plasmid pTN2 (gift of A. Kikuchi, Tokyo Institute of Technology). The protein was purified by the procedure of Fujii-Nakata et al. (39Fujii-Nakata T. Ishimi Y. Okuda A. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20980-20986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except with the modification that after the last purification on the Mono Q column, the protein was reapplied to a Mono S column followed by concentration on a second Mono Q column. This additional step provided a homogenous protein free of RNase and DNase activity. This preparation provided maximum deposition of histone when the ratio of NAP1 to histones was 1:1 by weight. An additional 35-bp sequence containing a T7 promoter was cloned into the XbaI–HindIII site of the T7/T3-19 plasmid (2238 bp; Bethesda Research Laboratories) to yield a plasmid with two T7 promoters 39 bp apart and a size of 2255 bp (2T7/T3-19). This DNA was used as the vector for the insertion of a 3800-bp SacI fragment excised from pT207–18 (gift of P. Yau and M. Bradbury, University of California, Davis). This fragment contains 18 repeats of the 207-bp 5 S gene of Lytechinus variegatus (40O'Neill T.E. Roberge M. Bradbury E.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This insertion yields a DNA of 6055 bp with two tandem promoters that directly transcribe into the insert (p2T7/T3-207-18). Circular, covalently closed, negatively coiled DNA (referred to here as “S”) was purified on CsCl-ethidium bromide density gradients followed by sedimentation on 5–20% sucrose gradients. For the preparation to be used as a template for transcription, the DNA was treated with MSB topoisomerase I at 0 °C in buffer conditions of 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.4. The angle between adjacent base pairs in DNA decreases by about 0.011 rotational degree for each degree centigrade decrease (41Depew R.E. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 4275-4279Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 42Pulleybank D.E. Shure M. Tang D. Vinograd J. Vosberg H.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 4280-4284Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 43Wang J.C. Peck L.J. Becherer K. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1982; 47: 85-91Crossref Google Scholar). By including 10 mmMgCl2, the angle is reduced even further (44Anderson P. Bauer W. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 594-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), so that after the topoisomerase I activity is terminated and the temperature is raised to 37 °C in isotonic conditions, the superhelical density is +0.011 SD. The 6055-bp DNA will contain an average of +6.5 coils. After treatment with the topoisomerase I, the DNA was phenol/chloroform-extracted and ethanol-precipitated prior to use. This DNA is referred to as “R”. The R DNA was used for these studies in order to discriminate by gel electrophoresis the template DNA that had been nicked during post-transcriptional processing of samples from template DNA that had remained covalently closed. In this way, it is possible to determine more precisely the conversion of template DNA from its original topological state (+0.011 SD) to a more positively stressed condition as a result of transcription. The buffer conditions and quantities of T7 RNA polymerase and E. coli topoisomerase I that were used were varied as described. The remainder of the transcription conditions were kept constant and included the following: a final concentration of 50 μg/ml in template DNA and 0.8 mm each of ATP, GTP, CTP, UTP, and 5 μCi/ml [α-32P]GTP (NEN Life Science Products). The UTP was excluded in the initial mix and was added later to initiate extended transcription. The mixture was incubated for 3 min at 37 °C in the presence of polymerase and topoisomerase. During this time, the promoters are saturated with the polymerase and transcription proceeds 13 bases before a UTP is required. Incubation was then continued for an additional 10 min in which the conditions were varied by including polyamines, poly-amino acids, protamine, or histones at the concentrations indicated. Synchronized transcription was then extended by adding UTP, and at specific time points the reaction was terminated by the addition of an equal volume of 0.4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 50 mm Tris, 25 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and 0.25% bromphenol blue. Samples were directly electrophoresed for RNA analysis, or aliquots were taken for analysis of 32P incorporation by trichloroacetic acid precipitation. The remainder was treated with 20 μg/ml RNase A for 30 min followed by 200 μg/ml proteinase K for 5 h at 37 °C. The DNA was electrophoresed on 1.0% agarose gels using buffer conditions as described previously (45Jackson S. Brooks W. Jackson V. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5392-5403Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). DNA was visualized by staining with ethidium bromide, exposed to uv, restained a second time, extensively destained in water, photographed, and imaged on XAR-5 film for densitometric analysis. As reported previously (46Jackson V. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10607-10619Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), highly positively coiled DNA intercalates ethidium bromide very poorly. For accurate quantitation, the gel must be stained and exposed to uv for 5 min in order to nick the DNA. The gel is then restained a second time followed by extensive destaining in water. In the transcription experiments in which histones were used, the buffer conditions were 100 mm NaCl, 40 mm Hepes, 6 mmMgCl2, 10 mm DTT (pH 7.3 or 7.9), and 0.8 mm each ATP, GTP, and CTP. The histone-NAP1 complexes were prepared in this same buffer at a final concentration of 100 μg/ml histone. After a 5-min incubation at 37 °C of the histones in this buffer, NAP1 (1:1 (w/w)) was added, and the incubation continued for 30 min. This solution was directly added to the mix containing the template DNA, and the incubation continued for 10 min before transcription was initiated with the addition of UTP. This 10-min incubation is sufficient to complete the deposition of histones to the template DNA by the NAP1 (see bottom panel of Fig. 9). These transcription studies were done on a closed circular DNA (6055 bp) that contains two tandemly arranged T7 promoters that are 39 bp apart. To facilitate the analysis of changes in the topological state of DNA during transcription, the DNA was preadjusted to a density of +0.011 SD (see “Experimental Procedures”). As shown in Fig. 1 A (lane R), the DNA averages +6.5 coils. As shown in Fig. 1 B, when this DNA was transcribed by 400 units/μg DNA of T7 RNA polymerase in the buffer conditions of 10 mm Hepes, 6 mm MgCl2, 10 mm DTT, pH 7.9, and in the presence of E. coli topoisomerase I (60 units/μg DNA), the number of positive coils increased substantially as transcription proceeded. That this change is due to an increase in positive coils can be shown in the two-dimensional analysis of Fig. 1 C. This pattern of distribution for DNA topoisomers is characteristic of positive coils when the second electrophoretic condition is in the presence of chloroquin (46Jackson V. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10607-10619Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 Dshows an analysis of the RNA that was produced during this transcription and indicates that the rate of transcription was 95 bases/s. That this formation of high levels of positive stress is dependent on the twin domain model of transcription-induced stress can be seen in Fig. 1 B (+ RNase lane). The lack of increased positive stress in this lane is interpreted as indicating that the RNase A is destroying the transcript as synthesis occurs. The RNA polymerase is free to rotate on the DNA and therefore unable to induce stress. We further characterized the conditions responsible for forming the positive stress with the following experiments. As shown in Fig. 1 E, when the quantity of polymerase was increased 4-fold, the number of positive coils increased so extensively that now one major band of very highly positively coiled DNA was observed (Fig. 1,region 1). An estimate of the superhelical density can be determined by an analysis of the DNA on CsCl-ethidium bromide gradients (46Jackson V. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10607-10619Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Using this approach, we estimate the level of stress to average +0.15 SD (data not shown). These results are in contrast to when the buffer condition was adjusted to include 100 mm NaCl. As shown in Fig. 1 F, there was a minimal change in the topological state of the DNA. This more physiological condition has negated the ability of E. colitopoisomerase I to remove negative coils that have been produced by transcription. Graphically shown in Fig. 2 A is an analysis of the levels of positive stress that were generated as a function of variations in ionic strength. Fig. 2 also shows the quantity of RNA that was produced during transcription in order to correlate levels of transcription with the quantity of positive stress that was produced. When the NaCl concentration was raised from 0 to 120 mm, there was a 2-fold increase in transcription. Yet even with this 2-fold increase in transcription, there was a rapid and precipitous decrease in the ability to form positive coils on the template. We interpret this observation as indicating that the monovalent ions are increasing the flexibility of the DNA through neutralization of the phosphates (47Manning G.S. Cell. Biophys. 1985; 7: 57-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 48Baumann C.G. Smith S.B. Bloomfield V.A. Bustamante C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6185-6190Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). The induced negative and positive coils are rapidly neutralized by translational diffusion around the circular plasmid before sufficient stress is generated to cause the helical perturbations (14Kung J. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 5398-5402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Kirkegaard K. Wang J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 185: 625-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 26Sinden R. DNA Structure and Function. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1994Google Scholar). The polyamines, putrescine (diamine) and spermidine (triamine), are found in prokaryotic cells in millimolar concentrations (49Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Microbiol. Rev. 1985; 49: 81-99Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In eukaryotic cells, spermine (tetramine) and spermidine are found in submillimolar and millimolar concentrations, respectively (50Sarhan S. Seiler N. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1989; 370: 1279-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 51Davis R.H. Morris D.R. Coffino P. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 56: 280-290Crossref Google Scholar). The polyamines are thought to function at several levels of RNA and DNA processing (52Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 749-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3236) Google Scholar). With regard to DNA, polyamines interact with both the major and minor groove in a sequence-dependent process (53Basu H.S. Shafer R.H. Marton L.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5873-5886Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 54Schmid N. Behr J.P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4357-4361Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 55Xiao L. Swank R.A. Matthews H.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3701-3708Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).

Because of this general neutralization of charge and the potential bridging of the multivalent polyamines between DNAs, higher concentrations will increase DNA-DNA affinity or self-association (56Krasnow M.A. Cozzarelli N.R.

As shown in Fig. 3, when transcription was done for 5 min in 100 mm NaCl and in the presence of increasing spermidine (Fig. 3 A) or spermine (Fig. 3 C), substantial positive stress was produced on the template. In both cases, the DNA has a superhelical density estimated to be +0.10 SD (Fig. 3 C, region 2). The minimal polyamine concentrations required to obtain this superhelical density were 4 and 0.8 mm, respectively. These data have been quantitated and are graphically shown in Fig. 2 B in order to compare with the levels of transcription that produced this stress. These data indicate that the transcription rate remained relatively unchanged throughout the range in which positive stress continued to be amplified for both polyamines. The increase in positive stress must be a result of a change in the physical property of the DNA or RNA synthesized from it. This altered character could be a change in the flexibility and/or an increase in self-association (aggregation) between nucleic acid molecules. The rate at which this positive stress is produced is shown in Fig. 3 F. In this experiment, the spermidine (6 mm) was added simultaneously with the initiation of transcription. High levels of positive stress were observed after 30 s, which suggests that whatever physical property is changed by the polyamines, it is changed very rapidly. We evaluated the factors that contributed to the induced positive stress by initially characterizing the aggregative state of the RNA and DNA. Transcription was done in the presence of increasing quantities of the polyamines, during which the samples were sedimented 27,000 ×g for 5 min. Both the supernatant (S) and pellet (P) were analyzed by gel electrophoresis for RNA and DNA content. As shown in Fig. 4 A, when the spermidine concentration was increased, there was a proportional increase in aggregation of both RNA and DNA. At 4 mm spermidine, approximately 10% of the DNA and RNA was in the pellet. RNA was the major factor that caused this aggregation, for in the absence of transcription no DNA was in the pellet (see Fig. 7 A). We can differentiate between the role of DNA flexibility and aggregation in inducing positive stress, providing we can minimiz"

Numerous studies have then shown the presence of abnormal transcripts in various tumors which appear to result from aberrant splicing of the gene, rather than from intragenic deletions. Moreover, many studies demonstrated that these aberrantly spliced transcripts were not found in matched normal tissues. We have analysed TSG101 transcripts in 85 breast cancer samples and found that abnormal splicing of the gene is tightly correlated with tumor grade and p53 mutation. In addition, stress induced the appearance of these abnormal transcripts in primary lymphocytes. Hence, TSG101 splicing defects, while unrelated to the oncogenic process per se, could reflect the cellular environment of the tumor cells. The proposed role of stress and hypoxia to select p53 mutant cells could account for the tight association with p53 status."
https://openalex.org/W2056992055,"The product of the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene, pRB, is a demonstrated substrate for the type 1 serine/threonine protein phosphatases (PP1). Curiously, there has been a paucity of data supporting the idea that phosphorylated pRB can be found in a complex with PP1. To more fully characterize the association between these two proteins, we utilized a PP1-affinity chromatography approach to increase our ability to capture from mammalian cell lysate populations of pRB capable of binding to PP1. Western blot analysis of the bound proteins indicates that both faster migrating, hypophosphorylated pRB, as well as slower migrating, hyperphosphorylated pRB can bind. Phosphorylated pRB binding was confirmed by immunoprecipitation of eluted 32P-labeled pRB. In addition, Western blotting of eluted proteins with pRB phosphorylated-site-specific antibodies revealed select phosphorylated forms of pRB binding to PP1. Similar binding studies performed with toxin-inhibited PP1 indicate that catalytic activity of PP1 is not required for pRB binding. The significance of this finding with respect to the functional importance of this interaction is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1587635962,"The spindle checkpoint blocks the initiation of anaphase in mitosis and meiosis if chromosomes are not aligned at the metaphase plate. The checkpoint functions by preventing a ubiquitin ligase called the anaphase-promoting complex/cy-closome (APC/C) from ubiquitinylating proteins whose destruction is required for anaphase onset. The spindle checkpoint signal originates at the kinetochores of unaligned chromosomes and is broadcast to the rest of the cell. Although the spindle checkpoint is not understood in detail, several components of the checkpoint-signaling pathway have been identified. Many of these components associate transiently with the kinetochores of unaligned chromosomes. We propose a model in which kinetochores that lack stable attachments to the spindle microtubules serve as catalytic staging areas for the assembly of inhibitor complexes. These inhibitor complexes then leave the kinetochores and block activity of the APC/C throughout the cell. We suggest that microtubule occupancy at kinetochores or physical tension induced by microtubule capture turns off the capability of the kinetochore to produce the APC/C inhibitor. Subsequently, the inhibitor concentration in the cell wanes and anaphase initiates.—Gorbsky, G. J., Kallio, M., Daum, J. R., Topper, L. M.

https://openalex.org/W1570428012,"There is nothing unusually significant or important associated with the words ‘cell’ or ‘biology’. Both have been around for a long time with clearly understood meanings. However, the phrase ‘cell biology’ as used in this discussion relates to the evolution of a discipline that has recently achieved recognition by scientific societies, granting agencies, and biological politics in general. Particular emphasis is given to the influence of Keith Roberts Porter in the following events. The origin of the term ‘cell biology’ per se would be difficult or impossible to trace. Its first use as a designation of an identifiable area of biology probably occurred shortly after World War II when Caspersson, Brachet, Runstrom, and others were instrumental in forming the International Society for Cell Biology as part of the International Union of Biological Sciences (IUBS). This society, though it had members from the U.S., did not gain great prominence. There was, however, a U.S. National Committee (USNC) of the IUBS. At its second annual meeting (6 April 1959 at the National Academy of Sciences), the USNC resolved that it “considers highly desirable the establishment of a national society of cell biology to act as a national representative of the International Society for Cell Biology.” This resolution was transmitted to the president of the Tissue Culture Association, Morgan Harris, with the feeling that the group might best serve as a base for formation of the new society. A year later, at the third annual meeting of the USNC (3 June 1960), it was recognized that a formal affiliation between a U.S. cell biology society and the IUBS would not be likely. In the interim, under the leadership of Keith Porter, a group of cell biologists met several times in New York and had established a provisional council for the purpose of organizing a society for cell biology. The USNC of the IUBS then graciously passed a resolution commending the action to form a new society. (The resolution passed with one dissenting vote, probably Dr. Thiman, who expressed regret at the formation of a new independent society. He had hoped rather for a federation of existing societies). Montrose Moses, who was an observer at the IUBS meeting, carried the resolution back to the provisional council and recommended that the liaison should be maintained between the two groups. The Tissue Culture Association deserves recognition because there was a major overlap of scientists in the two groups. Also, the first electron microscope developments by Claude, Murphy, Porter, Palade, and others were evolved from tissue culture techniques. In November 1946, at Hershey, Pa., a conference on in vitro problems was organized by Albert Claude for the Physiology Panel of the Committee on Growth of the National Research Council (NRC). (This committee administered the sizeable research funds of the American Cancer Society.) Ross G. Harrison gave the keynote address. By preceding correspondence and conversations during that meeting, Keith Porter collected a splinter group of 34 like-minded scientists to discuss the primary problem of lack of standards for the preparation of media tissue culture. At that time there was no mention of collation of tissue culture techniques. Each laboratory had its own recipe for preparing media (sometimes secret) that were developed empirically by trial and error for their particular needs, sometimes solved by adding a modicum of magic chick embryo extract. Much time was wasted washing glassware, sterilization, etc. At that informal meeting, Dale Coman suggested that Keith Porter be president of a new organization. Porter in turn appointed Dale Coman as vice president. Margaret Murray agreed to be secretary, and Duncan Hetherington became treasurer. Because of the declared need for standardized media, Tissue Culture Commission was chosen as the name, keeping in mind the successful Commission on Biological Stains organized by H. J. Conn. With the adoption of a constitution and increased committee activity, the name was changed to Tissue Culture Association circa 1948. Things progressed rapidly. During 1948–1950, room was provided for a media testing and standardization laboratory under Porter's supervision in the close-by Sloan-Kettering Institute by Director C. P. Rhoads (also chairman of the Committee on Growth, NRC). Harry Eagle, director of the National Cancer Institute, provided material and personnel support for the lab. Space in the Rockefeller was refused because the director, Herbert Gasser, did not want to get involved in possible for-profit research. Porter then attracted the interest of two commercial labs, Microbiological Associates and Difco. By 1949, nine media certified by the Tissue Culture Association were available, three from the former and six from the latter. Tremendously beneficial to the science was Margaret Murray's dedication to the development of a tissue culture bibliography, cross-indexed by subject. Her first two volumes in 1950 contained 86,000 entries. Another important development was the establishment of summer tissue culture technique courses. The first, in 1948, was held in Raymond Parker's tissue culture lab in Toronto, with sixteen students including Harry Eagle and Don Fawcett. According to Porter, Parker became somewhat annoyed by possible contaminations brought in by neophytes. The succeeding year the course was moved to Cooperstown into a space provided by the Mary Imogene Bassett Hospital. The hospital had no interest in tissue culture per se but welcomed the excitement. A good working relationship quickly developed. Porter reported many “fabulous meetings.” The above narrative depicts the tremendous explosion of tissue culture science during the period of 1946–1950 with Porter being a prominent instigator. A review of all personalities involved also explains why the USNC of the IUBS saw fit to recommend that the Tissue Culture Association was a logical base for formation of a U.S. Cell Biology Society. The suggestion was received with definite mixed feelings by the association. After considerable discussion and expression of strong opinion, the proposal was declined primarily on the basis that the more broad potentials of cell biology would dilute and subvert the more clearly defined objectives of the Tissue Culture Association. The decision proved beneficial to both groups. During the period 1953–1956, Malcolm Ray and I were working as professional associates in the Medical Sciences Division of the NRC. Our responsibility was the Committee on Growth, which handled the research grant funds of the American Cancer Society. These were sizable, important research funds administered through several panels (Physiology, etc.) Unfortunately, the American Cancer Society dropped its contract with the NRC and moved its granting activities to an in-house group of experts in New York. Both Malcolm and I migrated to NIH. There I became executive secretary of the Morphology and Genetics Study Section in the Division of Research Grants (DRG). The workload became heavy enough in 1958 to force splitting the study section in two. Kay Wilson became executive secretary for Genetics, and I retained Morphology. The latter section lived only a few days. With permission of Ernest Allen, director of DRG, I changed the name to Cell Biology. Operations remained the same. Most of the following relates to the earlier section. Committee membership rotated, but for the period under immediate discussion, the following names can be mentioned: Don Costello, Don Fawcett, Keith Porter, Hans Ris, Stan Bennett, Folk Skoog, Elmer Butler, Ernst Scharrer, Hewson Swift, and Dale Coman (Fig. 1). C. P. (Pete) Oliver was chairman during most of this time. At the end of his tenure, he chaired the first meeting of the new Cell Biology Study Section on 27 September 1958. Elmer Butler became chairman for meetings after that. It is always interesting to connect names to historical events. The U.S. Public Health Service (USPHS) was originated to care for the health of our U.S. seamen and to guard ports against the influx of possible diseases. The USPH hospitals are called Marine Hospitals. The National Institute of Health (singular) arose later within the USPHS to conduct surveys and study diseases. Gradually, an intramural research program developed. After World War II, the Office of Naval Research closed down its research program (headed by Orr Reynolds). A considerable residual sun was offered to Dr. Parran, surgeon general, USPHS, to be used in some way to promote research. The proposal percolated down through several administrative layers, ending up with Cassius J. Van Slyke, then associate director of NIH (succeeded by James Shannon, director). He circulated an absolutely naive letter to academic institutions asking if they could use some money for research purposes. A deluge of requests descended on him sufficient to attract the attention of Congress. In retrospect, his letter was not so naive because Congress within a few years was awarding almost embarrassingly generous funds that at times far exceeded those recommended by the Administration. Two influential promoters were Senator Hill and Congressman Fogarty. Ernest M. Allen organized and became the first director of the DRG located in an old World War II temporary building, T-6, on the NIH campus. Ernest was one of a kind, bordering on true genius. He graduated from Emory University and attained a Masters degree in French. This was in the midst of the almost forgotten Depression. He then became involved in one of Franklin D. Roosevelt's programs, the National Youth Administration. There his flair for administration caught the attention of a friend of FDR and an influential Democrat, Boisfeuillet Jones (called ‘Bo’ Jones by most and ‘Buffalo’ Jones by a few). With Jones as a mentor, Allen ended up at NIH. His intelligence and natural southern charm defused many tense situations. Further, he did not operate in a vacuum. Working closely with him as deputy was Dale Lindsay, M.D., a career USPHS officer and Berwin (Bert) Cole, chief of the Project Review Branch, DRG. This branch had the important task of reviewing all NIH grant applications and assigning them to study sections for evaluation (plus a priority score) and to the councils of appropriate institutes for program funding. By this method, peer review was isolated from the often political program decisions. The councils, in addition to scientists, had lay members such as Mrs. Mary Lasker, who had considerable political clout. Many pressures were involved. Fortunate to his mission, Bert was one of the most ethical persons I have known. He eventually became an associate commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration before reaching retirement. The primary duty of the study sections was to evaluate each grant application and assign a priority score. In addition to the primary duty, each study section was to be alert to detect new scientific needs that might occur within their purview. For the latter purpose, each study section had a ‘chairman's grant’, an open-end source of funds doled out by someone in the director's office as needed. These funds covered project site visits to investigate applications to see if, for example, they had realistic back-up support for the home institution. The funds could also be used for more or less ad hoc meetings of small groups of scientists to discuss a new scientific idea or problem. In 1957–1958, the Morphology and Genetics Study Section and the new Cell Biology Study Section at their triennial meetings intermittently discussed the desirability of establishing block-type research support for groups of investigators working on the increasingly complex studies of the cell. They hoped to obtain the synergistic effect of interdisciplinary approaches within a group and at the same time decrease the administrative demands of dealing with individual projects. Central to the idea was the sharing of use of major equipment such as electron microscopes. Keith Porter, Don Fawcett, and Dale Coman in particular were strong proponents. Finally, using money from the chairman's grant, Porter and I were authorized to visit some of the more active national institutions in order to ask their opinions. The responses were, predictably, positive and included helpful suggestions. Ernest Allen, director of DRG, had kept a sympathetic eye on our efforts. He immediately circulated a long memo (six pages) to all the National Advisory Councils and all study sections, dated 24 October 1958 and entitled “Recommendation of the Cell Biology Study Section for Special Programming in Cell Biology.” It contained a recommendation from the study section for the establishment of a specific program, called University Laboratories in Cell Biology, funded and operated within existing NIH grant framework. A first draft of the proposal was prepared by an ad hoc group with Keith Porter (chairman), Clifford Grobstein, Heinz Herrmann, Daniel Mazia, Ernst Scharrer, Van Potter, and Herbert Taylor. The final draft was prepared by a formal study section subcommittee composed of C. P. Oliver (chairman), Elmer Butler, Don Costello, Don Fawcett, Keith Porter, and Ernst Scharrer. The final document was approved at the section meeting on 27 September 1958 and forwarded to Ernst Allen. The proposal created quite a stir at NIH but was eventually talked to a quiet death. It did not neatly fit into the existing granting framework, and, equally important, the concept of large project grants was not yet fully recognized. However, the effort paid big dividends because the term ‘cell biology’ then became well recognized as denoting a discipline. In another step to popularize the name ‘cell biology’, Porter, as editor of the Journal of Biophysical and Biochemical Cytology, published by Rockefeller, changed the name to Journal for Cell Biology. The new president of Rockefeller, Detlev Bronk, objected to usurping the name of an already recognized journal but finally gave permission, and the first issue of the new journal appeared as volume 11, January 1962. Using funds from the chairman's grant of the Cell Biology Study Section, NIH, a group of interested biologist met at the Rockefeller University in New York on 9 January and again on 28 May 1960 and established themselves as a provisional council for the formation of the American Society for Cell Biology. The council then appointed an executive committee to handle the details. The executive committee consisted of Don Fawcett, Morgan Harris, Montrose Moses (secretary), Keith Porter (chairman), Hans Ris, Hewson Swift, and Herbert Taylor. The committee met at the Rockefeller University 18 July 1960 and agreed that the first meeting of the new society should be at the centrally located city of Chicago. In March 1961, the National Advisory Health Council of the National Institutes of Health awarded funds to Hewson Swift as principal investigator and Keith Porter as coprincipal investigator for project RG-8554, First Meeting of American Society for Cell Biology. The meeting was held 2–4 November 1961 at the Edgewater Beach Hotel, Chicago. Hewson Swift was chairman of the General Program Committee. The program included three symposia: Cell Continuity (Herbert Stern, chair), Cell Diversification (Heinz Herrmann, chair), and Characteristics of Cell Interfaces (A. K. Solomon, chair). Officers elected were Don Fawcett, president; Alex Novikoff, president-elect; Montrose Moses, secretary; and Hans Ris, treasurer. Because of the rapid changes occurring in the biological sciences, it was quite natural that the National Science Foundation would also recognize the need for revised methods of grant support. In 1953 it established a program in molecular biology that flourished quite well. Cell biology was not neglected, however, having a number of advisory groups including panels for developmental biology, genetics, and for human cell biology. In my correspondence with Herman L. Lewis (head, Cellular Biology Section, NSF, 23 November 1971), he stated that the barrier between molecular and cell biology, if indeed a real one, was disappearing. In recent months I have corresponded with Margaret Henkart, director of the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biology, NSF. Many academic departments now use the joint title, so the terms are indeed compatible. A major share of the above discussion is derived from my own personal knowledge of events amplified by extensive conversations and correspondence with Keith Porter. Details of some of the earlier history of NIH came from Berwin A. Cole. One very memorable moment occurred when the study section, because of scheduling difficulties, was meeting one weekend in a small conference room in the Clinical Center of the NIH campus. Dale Coman happened to be seated next to Don Fawcett, M.D., when Dale collapsed with a heart attack. Fortunately, Luther Terry, director of the Heart Institute (and future surgeon general, USPHS) was in his office at the Clinic. Fast work. Complete success. The indispensable ‘super secretary’ for the study section was Alma Simons, who had already retired from several government positions but still worked because she enjoyed it. She was quite wealthy, and the study section members were delighted to have her meet them at the airport with her Cadillac. Keith Roberts Porter died May 2, 1997, and is interred in his native Nova Scotia with his wife, Elizabeth."
https://openalex.org/W1647978803,"The smooth endoplasmic reticulum (S-ER) is transported on actin filaments in the giant axon of the squid. The identity of the myosin motors that transport S-ER in the squid giant axon has been determined. Our recent studies have shown that the motor for movement of S-ER vesicles on actin filaments is Myosin-V (1). These findings grew out of a series of studies that began with the initial observation that vesicles in the giant axon of the squid move on both microtubules and actin filaments (2). These initial studies documented the ability of individual vesicles to move from microtubules to actin filaments and led to the development of the dual filament model of vesicle transport (3, 4). The model proposes that long-range movement of vesicles occurs on microtubules and short-range movement on actin filaments. S-ER vesicles were identified as the major population of vesicles in the axon that use myosin-V for movement on actin filaments. The S-ER is the primary site of calcium storage, and it regulates the local cytosolic calcium concentration. Calcium release from the S-ER in neurons couples electrical excitation to signal transduction cascades. The signaling cascades triggered by the release of calcium from S-ER in dendritic spines are postulated to initiate the cellular mechanisms that lead to learning and memory."

https://openalex.org/W1865451787,"How can we learn about dynamic fine structures that are far too small to be resolved with the light microscope without destroying the active living cell? Examples spanning the last half century show how polarized light microscopy can-and should-continue to provide an attractive window for such studies. Long before microtubules were found with electron microscopy, or their assembly properties were biochemically characterized in isolated cell-free systems, the dynamic fine structure of the mitotic spindle and assembly properties of its microtubules were revealed in living cells by polarized light microscopy. More recently, the polarizing microscope was improved, by invention of the new Pol-Scope, so that quantitative measurements of bire-fringence retardation and axes could be made rapidly for all image pixels independent of their birefringence axis orientation. In addition, the centrifuge polarizing microscope, just developed, allows us to follow the dynamic ordering of fine structures in living cells as they become stratified or restructured by centrifugal acceleration of up to ten thousand times gravity. The significance of these technological advances is discussed-Inoué, S. Windows to dynamic fine structures, then and now."

https://openalex.org/W1570601082,"Our laboratory studies have shown that transplantation of adrenal medullary tissue or isolated chromaffin cells into central nervous system (CNS) pain modulatory regions (i.e., periaqueductal gray and subarachnoid lumbar spinal cord) can reduce pain sensitivity of rats in both acute and chronic pain. The analgesia produced by these transplants is thought to result from release of both opiate peptides and catecholamines. Morphologically, these animal studies also suggest that there is no development of tolerance over long periods of time, and the transplanted chromaffin cells appear to be robust and well integrated with the host tissue. In our initial clinical studies, where allografts of adrenal medullary tissue were transplanted intrathecally to relieve intractable cancer pain, patients obtained significant and long-lasting pain relief. Increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of metenkephalin were correlated with the decreased pain scores. Histology of autopsy tissue obtained from two patients with 1 year transplants revealed viable transplanted chromaffin cells. Because of the limited availability of human adrenal glands, sources of xenogeneic chromaffin cells will need to be identified if effective transplantation therapy for chronic pain is to be developed further."
