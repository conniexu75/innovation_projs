https://openalex.org/W3046329998,"We created a facet atlas that maps the interrelations between facet scales from 13 hierarchical personality inventories to provide a practically useful, transtheoretical description of lower-level personality traits. We generated this atlas by estimating a series of network models that visualize the correlations among 268 facet scales administered to the Eugene-Springfield Community Sample (Ns = 571-948). As expected, most facets contained a blend of content from multiple Big Five domains and were part of multiple Big Five networks. We identified core and peripheral facets for each Big Five domain. Results from this study resolve some inconsistencies in facet placement across instruments and highlight the complexity of personality structure relative to the constraints of traditional hierarchical models that impose simple structure. This facet atlas (also available as an online point-and-click app at tedschwaba.shinyapps.io/appdata/) provides a guide for researchers who wish to measure a domain with a limited set of facets as well as information about the core and periphery of each personality domain. To illustrate the value of a facet atlas in applied and theoretical settings, we examined the network structure of scales measuring impulsivity and tested structural hypotheses from the Big Five Aspect Scales inventory."
https://openalex.org/W3046866925,"Grapevines, although adapted to occasional drought or salt stress, are relatively sensitive to growth- and yield-limiting salinity stress. To understand the molecular mechanisms of salt tolerance and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and identify genes commonly regulated by both stresses in grapevine, we investigated transcript profiles in leaves of the salt-tolerant grapevine rootstock 1616C under salt- and ER-stress. Among 1643 differentially expressed transcripts at 6 h post-treatment in leaves, 29 were unique to ER stress, 378 were unique to salt stress, and 16 were common to both stresses. At 24 h post-treatment, 243 transcripts were unique to ER stress, 1150 were unique to salt stress, and 168 were common to both stresses. GO term analysis identified genes in categories including ‘oxidative stress’, ‘protein folding’, ‘transmembrane transport’, ‘protein phosphorylation’, ‘lipid transport’, ‘proteolysis’, ‘photosynthesis’, and ‘regulation of transcription’. The expression of genes encoding transporters, transcription factors, and proteins involved in hormone biosynthesis increased in response to both ER and salt stresses. KEGG pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes for both ER and salt stress were divided into four main categories including; carbohydrate metabolism, amino acid metabolism, signal transduction and lipid metabolism. Differential expression of several genes was confirmed by qRT-PCR analysis, which validated our microarray results. We identified transcripts for genes that might be involved in salt tolerance and also many genes differentially expressed under both ER and salt stresses. Our results could provide new insights into the mechanisms of salt tolerance and ER stress in plants and should be useful for genetic improvement of salt tolerance in grapevine."
https://openalex.org/W3046391256,"Flavonoids are key components of licorice plant that directly affect its medicinal quality. Importantly, the MYB family of transcription factors serves to regulate the synthesis of flavonoids in plants. The MYB transcription factors represent one of the largest families of transcription factors in plants and play important roles in the process of plant growth and development. MYB gene expression is induced by a number of plant hormones, including the lipid-based hormone jasmonate (JA). Methyl jasmonate (MeJA) is an endogenous plant growth regulator that can induce the JA signaling pathway, which functions to regulate the synthesis of secondary metabolites, including flavonoids. In this study, MeJA was added to licorice cell suspensions, and RNA-seq analysis was performed to identify the differentially expressed genes. As a result, the MYB transcription factors GlMYB4 and GlMYB88 were demonstrated to respond significantly to MeJA induction. Subsequently, the GlMYB4 and GlMYB88 protein were shown to localize to the cell nucleus, and it was verified that GlMYB4 and GlMYB88 could positively regulate the synthesis of flavonoids in licorice cells. Overall, this research helps illustrate the molecular regulation of licorice flavonoid biosynthesis induced by MeJA."
https://openalex.org/W3046266103,"Osteoporotic hip fracture is a major public health issue. Estimation of the outcome and maximization of functional recovery after fracture is very important in the treatment of older patients. The purposes of this study were to clarify the functional outcomes after the treatment of hip fracture and to identify the factors that influence functional recovery. In the present study, 228 patients admitted to an acute-care hospital from January 2016 to June 2018 were evaluated. The patients were categorized into a trochanteric fracture group (n = 128) and a neck fracture group (n = 100). We retrospectively reviewed their ambulation ability 6 months after fracture using the Functional Ambulation Category (FAC) score. The other survey items were the presurgical duration, length of hospital stay, time until beginning to walk using parallel bars, complications affecting treatment, and mortality rate. The 6-month follow-up rate was 54.4% (n = 124). The results showed that the patients with trochanteric fracture were significantly older than those with neck fracture (86 vs. 82 years, respectively; p = 0.03). In total, 85.0% of patients with trochanteric fracture and 92.2% of patients with neck fracture were independent ambulators before injury (FAC score of 4 or 5). The FAC score 6 months after fracture was positively correlated with the FAC score before fracture and at discharge (all p<0.001) and negatively correlated with patient age (p<0.001) and presurgical duration for patients with neck fracture (p = 0.04). There was no statistically significant correlation with the length of hospital stay or the time until beginning to walk using parallel bars. In conclusion, patients with trochanteric fractures were older than those with neck fractures. In both fracture types, walking recovery 6 months after hip fracture was related to the FAC score before injury and at discharge from an acute-care hospital but not to the time until beginning to walk using parallel bars."
https://openalex.org/W3046857015,"The nature and timing of caregivers’ speech provides an important foundation for infant attention and language development in the first year of life. Infant-directed speech is a key component of responsive parent-infant communication that is typically characterised by exaggerated intonation and positive affect. This study examines the effect of postnatal depression on the expression of positive vocal affect and pitch, the quantity of mothers’ infant-directed speech input and the timing of vocal responses between mother and infant. Postnatal mothers currently experiencing symptoms of depression (n = 13) were matched to postnatal mothers who were not experiencing symptoms of depression (n = 13), and audio-recorded while playing with their 6-month-old infants. Compared with depressed mothers, non-depressed mothers used a higher mean pitch and pitch range, spoke more, gave faster verbal responses and were rated as expressing more positive valence in their voice. These preliminary findings indicate that mothers experiencing low mood use less infant-directed speech and less exaggerated pitch with prelinguistic infants. Postnatal depression is a major health issue that adversely impacts the parent and child. Early interventions for PND may benefit from identifying ways to support the timing of conversations and mothers’ use of appropriate vocal pitch and infant-directed speech modifications. Further research is needed to confirm whether these strategies support early conversations."
https://openalex.org/W3046440438,"Surgical castration of male piglets without analgesia is a painful procedure. This prospective, randomized and double-blinded study aimed to evaluate the analgesic effects of four different local anesthetics for piglet castration during the first week of life. In total, 54 piglets aged 3 to 7 days were distributed into 6 treatment groups: handling (H); castration without pain relief (sodium chloride, NaCl); and castration with a local anesthetic: 4% procaine (P), 2% lidocaine (L), 0.5% bupivacaine (B) or 20 mg/ml mepivacaine (M). By excluding stress and fear as disruptive factors via a minimum anesthesia model, all piglets received individual minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) isoflurane anesthesia. Twenty minutes before castration, all treatment groups except group H received one injection per testis. Then, 0.5 ml of a local anesthetic or NaCl was injected intratesticularly (i.t.), and 0.5 ml was administered subscrotally. Acute physiological responses to noxious stimuli at injection and castration were evaluated by measuring blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), cortisol, epinephrine, norepinephrine and chromogranin A (CgA); limb movements were quantified. The results confirm that castration without analgesia is highly painful. Surgical castration without pain relief revealed significant changes in mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and HR. Local anesthetic administration significantly reduced changes in BP and HR associated with castration. Piglets receiving a preoperative local anesthetic exhibited the fewest limb movements during castration, while the NaCl group exhibited the most. Injection itself was not associated with significant changes in MAP or HR. However, many piglets exhibited limb movements during injection, indicating that the injection itself causes nociceptive pain. No significant differences were found between groups regarding parameters of plasma cortisol, catecholamines and CgA. In conclusion, all four local anesthetics administered are highly effective at reducing signs of nociception during castration under light isoflurane anesthesia. However, injection of a local anesthetic seems to be painful."
https://openalex.org/W3046806428,"This study aimed to examine the association between disability and cardiovascular (CV) disease incidence and mortality in Korea longitudinally, using a national representative sample. We used the National Health Insurance Service-National Health Screening Cohort (NHIS-HEALS) database, which includes information on the disability of the National Screening Program participants such as severity and type of disability, which were obtained from the Korean National Disability Registry. Cox proportional hazard models were used to evaluate the association between disability and CV disease incidence and mortality. We constructed four models with different levels of adjustment, in which Model 3 was a fully adjusted model. This study included 514,679 participants, and 7,317 CV deaths were reported within a mean follow up of 10.8 ± 3.9 years (maximum, 13.9 years). For 5,572,130 person-year (PY) follow-up, the CV mortality rate was 1.313 per 1,000 PY. In Models 1 and 2, CV disease incidence was significantly higher in participants with disability than in those without disability. In Model 3, the incidence was higher only among participants aged 50–64 years and severe disabled participants aged <50 years. CV mortality was significantly higher in participants with disability than in those without disability in all Models, and the mortality increased in both sexes in Models 1 and 2 but only increased in men in Model 3. Similar results were observed in the subgroup analysis of health behavior and chronic diseases. People with disability showed higher CV disease incidence and mortality than those without disability, regardless of the type of disability or risk factors for CV disease."
https://openalex.org/W3046887431,"Australian rates of campylobacteriosis are among the highest in developed countries, yet only limited work has been done to characterize Campylobacter spp. in Australian retail products. We performed whole genome sequencing (WGS) on 331 C. coli and 285 C. jejuni from retail chicken meat, as well as beef, chicken, lamb and pork offal (organs). Campylobacter isolates were highly diverse, with 113 sequence types (STs) including 38 novel STs, identified from 616 isolates. Genomic analysis suggests very low levels (2.3-15.3%) of resistance to aminoglycoside, beta-lactam, fluoroquinolone, macrolide and tetracycline antibiotics. A majority (>90%) of isolates (52/56) possessing the fluoroquinolone resistance-associated T86I mutation in the gyrA gene belonged to ST860, ST2083 or ST7323. The 44 pork offal isolates were highly diverse, representing 33 STs (11 novel STs) and harboured genes associated with resistance to aminoglycosides, lincosamides and macrolides not generally found in isolates from other sources. Prevalence of multidrug resistant genotypes was very low (<5%), but ten-fold higher in C. coli than C. jejuni. This study highlights that Campylobacter spp. from retail products in Australia are highly genotypically diverse and important differences in antimicrobial resistance exist between Campylobacter species and animal sources."
https://openalex.org/W3047575652,"Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) preparations are often extracts of single or multiple herbs containing hundreds of compounds, and hence it has been difficult to study their mechanisms of action. Compound Kushen Injection (CKI) is a complex mixture of compounds extracted from two medicinal plants and has been used in Chinese hospitals to treat cancer for over twenty years. To demonstrate that a systematic analysis of molecular changes resulting from complex mixtures of bioactives from TCM can identify a core set of differentially expressed (DE) genes and a reproducible set of candidate pathways. We used in vitro cancer models to measure the effect of CKI on cell cycle phases and apoptosis, and correlated those phenotypes with CKI induced changes in gene expression. We treated two cancer cell lines with or without CKI and assessed the resulting phenotypes by employing cell viability and proliferation assays. Based on these results, we carried out high-throughput transcriptome data analysis to identify genes and candidate pathways perturbed by CKI. We integrated these differential gene expression results with previously reported results and carried out validation of selected differentially expressed genes. CKI induced cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in the cancer cell lines tested. In these cells CKI also altered the expression of 363 core candidate genes associated with cell cycle, apoptosis, DNA replication/repair, and various cancer pathways. Of these, 7 are clinically relevant to cancer diagnosis or therapy, 14 are cell cycle regulators, and most of these 21 candidates are downregulated by CKI. Comparison of our core candidate genes to a database of plant medicinal compounds and their effects on gene expression identified one-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many regulatory relationships between compounds in CKI and DE genes. By identifying genes and promising candidate pathways associated with CKI treatment based on our transcriptome-based analysis, we have shown that this approach is useful for the systematic analysis of molecular changes resulting from complex mixtures of bioactives."
https://openalex.org/W3046243452,"Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) has recently been shown to be involved in bone development and has been implicated in bone diseases, such as Job's Syndrome. Bone growth and changes have been known for many years to differ between sexes with male bones tending to have higher bone mass than female bones and older females tending to lose bone mass at faster rates than older males. Previous studies using conditional knock mice with Stat3 specifically deleted from the osteoblasts showed both sexes exhibited decreased bone mineral density (BMD) and strength. Using the Cre-Lox system with Cathepsin K promotor driving Cre to target the deletion of the Stat3 gene in mature osteoclasts (STAT3-cKO mice), we observed that 8-week old STAT3-cKO female femurs exhibited significantly lower BMD and bone mineral content (BMC) compared to littermate control (CN) females. There were no differences in BMD and BMC observed between male knock-out and male CN femurs. However, micro-computed tomography (μCT) analysis showed that both male and female STAT3-cKO mice had significant decreases in bone volume/tissue volume (BV/TV). Bone histomorphometry analysis of the distal femur, further revealed a decrease in bone formation rate and mineralizing surface/bone surface (MS/BS) with a significant decrease in osteoclast surface in female, but not male, STAT3-cKO mice. Profiling gene expression in an osteoclastic cell line with a knockdown of STAT3 showed an upregulation of a number of genes that are directly regulated by estrogen receptors. These data collectively suggest that regulation of STAT3 differs in male and female osteoclasts and that inactivation of STAT3 in osteoclasts affects bone turnover more in females than males, demonstrating the complicated nature of STAT3 signaling pathways in osteoclastogenesis. Drugs targeting the STAT3 pathway may be used for treatment of diseases such as Job's Syndrome and osteoporosis."
https://openalex.org/W3046756093,"Background Few studies report the effects of tamoxifen intake and the occurrence of de novo fatty liver and the deterioration of existing fatty liver. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of tamoxifen on fatty change of liver over time and also the impact of fatty liver on the prognosis of patients with breast cancer. Methods This was a single-center, retrospective study of patients who were diagnosed with primary breast cancer from January 2007 to July 2017. 911 consecutive patients were classified into three groups according to treatment method: tamoxifen group, aromatase inhibitor (AI) group, and control group. Results Median treatment duration was 49 months (interquartile range, IQR; 32–58) and median observational period was 85 months (IQR; 50–118). Long-term use of tamoxifen significantly aggravated fatty liver status compared to AI or control groups [hazard ratio (HR): 1.598, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.173–2.177, P = 0.003] after adjusting other factors. When analyzed separately depending on pre-existing fatty liver at baseline, tamoxifen was involved in the development of de novo fatty liver [HR: 1.519, 95% CI: 1.100–2.098, P = 0.011) and had greater effect on fatty liver worsening (HR: 2.103, 95% CI: 1.156–3.826, P = 0.015). However, the progression of fatty liver did not significantly affect the mortality of breast cancer patients. Conclusions Tamoxifen had a significant effect on the fatty liver status compared to other treatment modalities in breast cancer patients. Although fatty liver did not affect the prognosis of breast cancer, meticulous attention to cardiovascular disease or other metabolic disease should be paid when used for a long time."
https://openalex.org/W3046894639,"Environmental adversity is associated with a wide range of biological outcomes and behaviors that seem to fulfill a need to favor immediate over long-term benefits. Adversity is also associated with decreased investment in cooperation, which is defined as a long-term strategy. Beyond establishing the correlation between adversity and cooperation, the channel through which this relationship arises remains unclear. We propose that this relationship is mediated by a present bias at the psychological level, which is embodied in the reproduction-maintenance trade-off at the biological level. We report two pre-registered studies applying structural equation models to test this relationship on large-scale datasets (the European Values Study and the World Values Survey). The present study replicates existing research linking adverse environments (both in childhood and in adulthood) with decreased investment in adult cooperation and finds that this association is indeed mediated by variations in individuals’ reproduction-maintenance trade-off."
https://openalex.org/W3046858192,"There is growing evidence that aquatic physiotherapy may be effective for people with Parkinson's Disease (PD) but most studies have investigated land based type exercises in the aquatic environment. Few studies have examined customised aquatic therapies such as the Halliwick concept which focuses on trunk rotation and core stabilisation.The primary aim was to determine the feasibility of a Halliwick style aquatic physiotherapy intervention for people with PD. The secondary aim was to compare the Halliwick intervention with traditional aquatic and land based physiotherapy in terms of disease severity, balance and fear of falling.Halliwick style aquatic, traditional aquatic and land based physiotherapy were trialled in a single blind pilot study. All interventions ran for 60 minutes per week over 12 weeks. Feasibility outcomes were safety, adherence and attrition. Secondary outcomes included the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor subsection (UPDRS-III), Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Mini BESTest and modified Falls Efficacy Scale (mFES).30 participants with moderate PD were recruited. Participant mean age was 72 years (SD 8.4; range 51-86) with moderate disease severity (median Hoehn & Yahr score 3; IQR 1).No falls occurred during intervention sessions, however ten participants reported falls during the study period. No other adverse consequences were reported. All groups had adherence over 85%. No within group significant differences were found in UPDRS-III, BBS or mFES scores post-intervention for all groups, but the Halliwick aquatic group improved significantly in the Mini BESTest post-intervention (p = 0.011, 95% CI -7.36,-1.31, t (10) = -2.98).Despite people with PD being a vulnerable population, aquatic physiotherapy, including the Halliwick style is a safe treatment option. Promising results for balance in the Halliwick aquatic group were observed, but further studies with larger sample sizes is required to increase confidence in the results."
https://openalex.org/W3046258938,"Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a subtype of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) that can lead to fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma, is characterized by hepatic inflammation. Despite evolving therapies aimed to ameliorate inflammation in NASH, the transcriptional changes that lead to inflammation progression in NAFLD remain poorly understood. The aim of this pilot study was to define transcriptional changes in early, non-fibrotic NAFLD using two independent biopsy-proven NAFLD cohorts.We extracted RNA from liver tissue of 40 patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD based on NAFLD Activity Score (NAS) (23 patients with NAS ≤3, 17 with NAS ≥5) and 21 healthy controls, and we compared changes in expression of 594 genes involved in innate immune function. Using plasma from an independent cohort of 67 patients with NAFLD and 15 healthy controls, we validated the gene changes observed using a multiplex protein assay.Compared to healthy controls, NAFLD patients with NAS ≥5 had differential expression of 211 genes, while those with NAS ≤3 had differential expression of only 14 genes. Notably, osteopontin (SPP1) (3.74-fold in NAS ≤3, 8.28-fold in NAS ≥5) and CXCL10 (2.27-fold in NAS ≤3, 8.28-fold in NAS ≥5) gene expression were significantly upregulated with histologic progression of NAFLD. Plasma osteopontin (SPP1) and CXCL10 are significantly increased in the presence of NAFLD, regardless of histologic grade. In addition, the plasma levels of these two proteins distinguish clearly between the presence or absence of NAFLD (AUC>0.90).Osteopontin (SPP1) and CXCL10 are upregulated early in non-fibrotic NAFLD and may serve as valuable non-invasive biomarkers."
https://openalex.org/W3046507005,"Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) agonists such as dioxin have been associated with obesity and the development of diabetes. Whole-body Ahr knockout mice on high-fat diet (HFD) have been shown to resist obesity and hepatic steatosis. Tissue-specific knockout of Ahr in mature adipocytes via adiponectin-Cre exacerbates obesity while knockout in liver increases steatosis without having significant effects on obesity. Our previous studies demonstrated that treatment of subcutaneous preadipocytes with exogenous or endogenous AHR agonists disrupts maturation into functional adipocytes in vitro. Here, we used platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (Pdgfrα)-Cre mice, a Cre model previously established to knock out genes in preadipocyte lineages and other cell types, but not liver cells, to further define AHR’s role in obesity. We demonstrate that Pdgfrα-Cre Ahr-floxed (Ahrfl/fl) knockout mice are protected from HFD-induced obesity compared to non-knockout Ahrfl/fl mice (control mice). The Pdgfrα-Cre Ahrfl/fl knockout mice were also protected from increased adiposity, enlargement of adipocyte size, and liver steatosis while on the HFD compared to control mice. On a regular control diet, knockout and non-knockout mice showed no differences in weight gain, indicating the protective phenotype arises only when animals are challenged by a HFD. At the cellular level, cultured cells from brown adipose tissue (BAT) of Pdgfrα-Cre Ahrfl/fl mice were more responsive than cells from controls to transcriptional activation of the thermogenic uncoupling protein 1 (Ucp1) gene by norepinephrine, suggesting an ability to burn more energy under certain conditions. Collectively, our results show that knockout of Ahr mediated by Pdgfrα-Cre is protective against diet-induced obesity and suggest a mechanism by which enhanced UCP1 activity within BAT might confer these effects."
https://openalex.org/W3046616840,"The use of natural products as feed additives in the poultry industry is increasing; however, most studies focus on performance and growth with little regard for determining mechanism. Our laboratory designed a chicken (Gallus gallus)-specific immunometabolic kinome peptide array. Using this tool to examine the active enzymes responsible for phosphorylation events (kinases) provides important information on host and cellular functions. The objective of this project was to determine if feeding a microencapsulated product comprised of a blend of organic acids and botanicals (AviPlus®P) impacts the intestinal kinome of broiler chickens (Gallus gallus). Day-of-hatch chicks were provided 0 or 500g/MT of the additive and jejunal and ileal segments collected for kinome analysis to determine the mode-of-action of the additive. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis was performed by uploading the statistically significant peptides to the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes database. As a whole, GO and KEGG analysis showed similar activities in the ileum and jejunum. However, there were a small number of KEGG pathways that were only activated in either the ileum or jejunum, but not both. Analysis of the adipocytokine and PI3K-AKT signaling pathways showed differences between ileal and jejunal activity that were controlled, in part, by AKT3. Additionally, cytokine/chemokine evaluation showed the ileum had higher IL1β, IL6, IL10, TNFα, IFNγ, CXCL8, and CCL4 mRNA expression levels (P<0.05). As a whole, the data showed the addition of microencapsulated organic acids and botanicals to a broiler diet activated many of the same signaling pathways in the ileum and jejunum; however, distinctions were observed. Taken together, the findings of this study begin to define the mode-of-action that microencapsulated organic acids and botanicals have on two important intestinal segments responsible for nutrient digestion and absorption in chickens."
https://openalex.org/W3046740926,"Background Globally, the prevalence of obesity is on the rise and has nearly tripled since 1975. In Ethiopia, despite not having well-documented evidence, abdominal obesity has been increasing dramatically, particularly in urban settings. Therefore, this study is intended to determine the prevalence and risk factors of abdominal obesity among adults in Dilla town, Ethiopia. Methods A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted between January and February 2018 in Dilla Town. A multi-stage sampling technique was employed to recruit 663 adults. The study was conducted in accordance with the World Health Organization (WHO) STEP wise approach. Waist circumference was measured using a flexible metric tape mid-way between the lowest rib and iliac crest with the participant standing at the end of gentle expiration. Abdominal obesity was determined using the International Diabetes Federation cutoff. A logistic regression model was fitted to identify risk factors of abdominal obesity. Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated to show the strength of association. Results A total of 634 adults participated in the study with a response rate of 95.6%. This study revealed that 155 (24.4%) [95% CI: (21.50, 27.80)] adults were abdominally obese. Higher odds of being abdominally obese were noted among adults with a high [AOR = 4.61, 95% CI: (2.51–8.45)] and middle [AOR = 3.22, 95% CI: (1.76–5.88)] wealth rank, consuming less diversified diet [AOR = 2.05, 95% CI: (1.31–3.19)], physical inactivity [AOR = 2.68, 95% CI: (1.70–4.22)] and being female [AOR = 1.92, 95% CI: (1.13–3.28)]. Conclusions The prevalence of abdominal obesity among adults in Dilla town is considerably high, and became an emerging nutrition related problem. Being in the middle and high wealth rank, physical inactivity, consuming less diversified diet, and being female were the risk factors of abdominal obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2794006380,"Spatial autocorrelation and spatial interaction are two important analytical processes for geographical analyses. However, the internal relations between the two types of models have not been brought to light. This paper is devoted to integrating spatial autocorrelation analysis and spatial interaction analysis into a logic framework by means of Getis-Ord’s indexes. Based on mathematical derivation and transform, the spatial autocorrelation measurements of Getis-Ord’s indexes are reconstructed in a new and simple form. A finding is that the local Getis-Ord’s indexes of spatial autocorrelation are equivalent to the rescaled potential energy indexes of spatial interaction theory based on power-law distance decay. The normalized scatterplot is introduced into the spatial analysis based on Getis-Ord’s indexes, and the potential energy indexes are proposed as a complementary measurement. The global Getis-Ord’s index proved to be the weighted sum of the potential energy indexes and the direct sum of total potential energy. The empirical analysis of the system of Chinese cities are taken as an example to illustrate the effect of the improved methods and measurements. The mathematical framework newly derived from Getis-Ord’s work is helpful for further developing the methodology of geographical spatial modeling and quantitative analysis."
https://openalex.org/W3046466757,"Rhodopseudomonas palustris PS3 is one of the purple phototrophic non-sulfur bacteria (PNSB), which have plant growth-promoting effects on various plants. To expand the scale of PS3 fermentation in a time- and cost-effective fashion, the purpose of this work was to evaluate the use of low-cost materials as culture media and to optimize the culture conditions via response surface methodology. Corn steep liquor (CSL) and molasses were identified as potential materials to replace the nitrogen and carbon sources, respectively, in the conventional growth medium. The optimum culture conditions identified through central composite design were CSL, 39.41 mL/L; molasses, 32.35 g/L; temperature, 37.9°C; pH, 7.0; and DO 30%. Under the optimized conditions, the biomass yield reached 2.18 ± 0.01 g/L at 24 hours, which was 7.8-fold higher than that under the original medium (0.28 ± 0.01 g/L). The correlation between the predicted and experimental values of the model was over 98%, which verified the validity of the response models. Furthermore, we verified the effectiveness of the R. palustris PS3 inoculant grown under the newly developed culture conditions for plant growth promotion. This study provides a potential strategy for improving the fermentation of R. palustris PS3 in low-cost media for large-scale industrial production."
https://openalex.org/W3046579681,"In air-breathing fish a reduction of gill surface area reduces the danger of losing oxygen taken up in the air-breathing organ (ABO) to hypoxic water, but it also reduces the surface area available for ion exchange, so that ion regulation may at least in part be transferred to other organs, like the kidney or the gut. In the air-breathing Arapaima gigas, gill lamellae regress as development proceeds, and starting as a water-breathing embryo Arapaima turns into an obligate air-breathing fish with proceeding development, suggesting that ion regulation is shifted away from the gills as the fish grows. In Arapaima the kidney projects medially into the ABO and thus, probably a unique situation among fishes, is in close contact to the gas of the ABO. We therefore hypothesized that the kidney would be predestined to adopt an increased importance for ion homeostasis, because the elevated ATP turnover connected to ion transport can easily be met by aerobic metabolism based on the excellent oxygen supply directly from the ABO. We also hypothesized that in gill tissue the reduced ion regulatory activity should result in a reduced metabolic activity. High metabolic activity and exposure to high oxygen tensions are connected to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), therefore the tissues exposed to these conditions should have a high ROS defense capacity. Using in vitro studies, we assessed metabolic activity and ROS production of gill, kidney and ABO tissue, and determined the activity of ROS degrading enzymes in small (~ 5g, 2-3 weeks old) and larger (~ 670 g, 3-4 months old) A. gigas. Comparing the three tissues revealed that kidney tissue oxygen uptake by far exceeded the uptake measured in gill tissue or ABO. ROS production was particularly high in gill tissue, and all three tissues had a high capacity to degrade ROS. Gill tissue was characterized by high activities of enzymes involved in the glutathione pathway to degrade ROS. By contrast, the tissues of the ABO and in particular the kidney were characterized by high catalase activities, revealing different, tissue-specific strategies in ROS defense in this species. Overall the differences in the activity of cells taken from small and larger fish were not as pronounced as expected, while at the tissue level the metabolic activity of kidney cells by far exceeded the activity of ABO and gill cells."

Based on the literature, we formulate the broad hypotheses that patience relates positively, while present bias associates negatively with positive outcomes in the domains under study. With the exception of unemployment, we document a consistent and often significant positive relationship between patience and the corresponding domain, with the strongest associations in educational attainment, wealth and financial decisions. We find that present bias associates significantly with saving decisions and financial difficulties."
https://openalex.org/W3046403189,"Aims To assess feasibility, acceptability, and early efficacy of monetary incentive-based interventions on fostering oral hygiene in young children measured with a Bluetooth-enabled toothbrush and smartphone application. Design A stratified, parallel-group, three-arm individually randomized controlled pilot trial. Setting Two Los Angeles area Early Head Start (EHS) sites. Participants 36 parent-child dyads enrolled in an EHS home visit program for 0–3 year olds. Interventions Eligible dyads, within strata and permuted blocks, were randomized in equal allocation to one of three groups: waitlist (delayed monetary incentive) control group, fixed monetary incentive package, or lottery monetary incentive package. The intervention lasted 8 weeks. Outcomes Primary outcomes were a) toothbrushing performance: mean number of Bluetooth-recorded half-day episodes per week when the child’s teeth were brushed, and b) dental visit by the 2-month follow-up among children with no prior dental visit. The a priori milestone of 20% more frequent toothbrushing identified the intervention for a subsequent trial. Feasibility and acceptability measures were also assessed, including frequency of parents syncing the Bluetooth-enabled toothbrush to the smartphone application and plaque measurement from digital photographs. Findings Digital monitoring of toothbrushing was feasible. Mean number of weekly toothbrushing episodes over 8 weeks was 3.9 in the control group, 4.1 in the fixed incentive group, and 6.0 in the lottery incentive group. The lottery group had 53% more frequent toothbrushing than the control group and 47% more frequent toothbrushing than the fixed group. Exploratory analyses showed effects concentrated among children ≤24 months. Follow-up dental visit attendance was similar across groups. iPhone 7 more reliably captured evaluable images than Photomed Cannon G16. Conclusions Trial protocol and outcome measures were deemed feasible and acceptable. Results informed the study protocol for a fully powered trial of lottery incentives versus a delayed control using the smart toothbrush and remote digital incentive program administration.

https://openalex.org/W3046853016,"With the introduction of the Clinical Trial Act in 2011, Mauritius has witnessed significant progress in the running of clinical trials. Our aim was to provide insights on the perception of clinical trials among Mauritian citizens and highlight areas of opportunities to address gaps in public perception and awareness.A mixed study was carried out which consisted of 2 phases: a qualitative, with thematic approach followed by a quantitative study with cross-sectional design. For the qualitative study, computer literate individuals were invited to fill an unstructured, online open-ended questionnaire. Conclusions derived from the latter were used to adapt a validated questionnaire which was then distributed to 400 consented participants.There were 23 participants who responded to the online qualitative survey, which showed poor knowledge and diverse views on clinical trials. Quantitatively up to 48% of the participants were not aware of clinical trials which included people of older age group, those from low socioeconomic status and those with low literacy level (p<0.050). Majority of respondents agreed with the value of research while a minority had poor perception related to trust in research companies and conduct of clinical trials. Respondents who had previously engaged in clinical research had better knowledge and perception compared to those who did not participate in one (Odds Ratio = 1.7).This novel study provided a foundation of how Mauritian citizens perceive clinical trials. Public awareness and educational programs can be created to address lack of awareness, the negative perceptions and knowledge gaps of clinical trials among Mauritian citizens."
https://openalex.org/W3046381911,"The occurrence of genotype by environment interaction (G x E), which is defined as the differential response of genotypes to environmental variation, is frequently reported in maize cultures, making it challenging to recommend cultivars. Methods allowing to study the potential nonlinear pattern of genotype responses to environmental variation allied to prior beliefs on unknown parameters are interesting to evaluate the phenotypic adaptability and stability of genotypes. In this context, the present study aimed to assess the adaptability and stability of maize hybrids, by using the Bayesian segmented regression model, and evaluate the efficacy of using informative and minimally informative prior distributions for the selection of cultivars. Randomized complete-block design experiments were carried out to study the yield (kg/ha) of 25 maize hybrids, in 22 different environments, in Northeastern Brazil. The Bayesian segmented regression model fitted using informative prior distributions presented lower credibility intervals and Deviance Criterium of Information values, compared to those obtained by fitting using minimally informative distributions. Therefore, the model using informative prior distributions was considered for the adaptability and stability evaluation of maize genotypes. Once most northeastern farmers in Brazil have limited capital, the genotype P4285HX should be considered for planting, due to its high yield performance and adaptability to unfavorable environments."
https://openalex.org/W3046342372,"Introduction Patient-centered care (PCC) is an approach to involve patients in health care delivery, to contribute to quality of care, and to strengthen health systems responsiveness. This article aims to highlight patient perspectives by showcasing their perceptions of their experience of PCC at primary health facilities in two districts in Uganda. Methods A mixed methods cross-sectional study was conducted in three public and two private primary health care facilities in rural eastern Uganda. In total, 300 patient exit survey questionnaires, 31 semi-structured Interviews (SSIs), 5 Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) and 5 feedback meetings were conducted. Data analysis was guided by a conceptual framework focusing on (1) understanding patients’ health needs, preferences and expectations, (2) describing patients perceptions of their care experience according to five distinct PCC dimensions, and (3) reporting patient reported outcomes and their recommendations on how to improve quality of care. Results Patient expectations were shaped by their access to the facility, costs incurred and perceived quality of care. Patients using public facilities reported doing so because of their proximity (78.3% in public PHCs versus 23.3% in private PHCs) and because of the free services availed. On the other hand, patients attending private facilities did so because of their perception of better quality of care (84.2% in private PHCs versus 21.7% in public PHCs). Patients expectations of quality care were expressed as the availability of medication, shorter waiting times, flexible facility opening hours and courteous health workers. Analysis of the 300 responses from patients interviewed on their perception of the care they received, pointed to higher normalized scores for two out of the five PCC dimensions considered: namely, exploration of the patient’s health and illness experience, and the quality of the relationship between patient and health worker (range 62.1–78.4 out of 100). The qualitative analysis indicated that patients felt that communication with health workers was enhanced where there was trust and in case of positive past experiences. Patients however felt uncomfortable discussing psychological or family matters with health workers and found it difficult to make decisions when they did not fully understand the care provided. In terms of outcomes, our findings suggest that patient enablement was more sensitive than patient satisfaction in measuring the effect of interpersonal patient experience on patient reported outcomes. Discussion and conclusion Our findings show that Ugandan patients have some understanding of PCC related concepts and express a demand for it. The results offer a starting point for small scale PCC interventions. However, we need to be cognizant of the challenges PCC implementation faces in resource constrained settings. Patients’ expectations in terms of quality health care are still largely driven by biomedical and technical aspects. In addition, patients are largely unaware of their right to participate in the evaluation of health care. To mitigate these challenges, targeted health education focusing on patients’ responsibilities and patient’s rights are essential. Last but not least, all stakeholders must be involved in developing and validating methods to measure PCC."
https://openalex.org/W3046375334,"Down syndrome (DS), is the most common cause of intellectual disability, and is characterized by defective neurogenesis during perinatal development. To identify metabolic aberrations in early neurogenesis, we profiled neurospheres derived from the embryonic brain of Ts1Cje, a mouse model of Down syndrome. High-throughput phenotypic microarray revealed a significant decrease in utilisation of 17 out of 367 substrates and significantly higher utilisation of 6 substrates in the Ts1Cje neurospheres compared to controls. Specifically, Ts1Cje neurospheres were less efficient in the utilisation of glucose-6-phosphate suggesting a dysregulation in the energy-producing pathway. T Cje neurospheres were significantly smaller in diameter than the controls. Subsequent preliminary study on supplementation with 6-phosphogluconic acid, an intermediate of glucose-6-phosphate metabolism, was able to rescue the Ts1Cje neurosphere size. This study confirmed the perturbed pentose phosphate pathway, contributing to defects observed in Ts1Cje neurospheres. We show for the first time that this comprehensive energetic assay platform facilitates the metabolic characterisation of Ts1Cje cells and confirmed their distinguishable metabolic profiles compared to the controls."
https://openalex.org/W3046701091,"Historical commons represent self-governed governance regimes that regulate the use and management of natural and man-made shared resources. Despite growing scientific interests, analyses of commons evolution and temporal dynamics are rare and drivers of change (birth, adaptation, dissolution) remain obscure. We apply an interdisciplinary approach and address these issues from an eco-evolutionary perspective. Analyses of > 400 Dutch commons over more than a millennium (between the 9th and the 20th century) uncovered that most commons originated between 1200 and 1700, and that there was a particularly high rate of evolution during 1300–1550, a pattern intermediate to gradualism and punctuated equilibrium in biological evolution. Dissolutions of commons were rare prior to 1800 and peaked around 1850, comparable to a mass extinction in biology. Temporal trends in number, spatial distribution, density, and dispersion of historical commons were distinctive and resembled developments seen at the levels of species and individuals in the growth of biological communities and populations, in that they showed signs of saturation determined by the abundance and distribution of resources. The spatiotemporal dynamics of commons also pointed to important roles of social, economic and political factors, such as new reclamations of resources and pressure on resources due to population growth. Despite internal and external pressures, the self-governing commons studied here were very successful, in the sense that they persisted for on average >350 years. There was a weak positive relationship between the use of multiple resources and the lifespan of commons, resembling associations between diversity and persistence seen in biological systems. It is argued that eco-evolutionary perspectives can further the understanding of the long-term dynamics of commons as institutions for collective action, vitalize future research, improve management of shared goods, and advise about sustainable utilization of finite resources."
https://openalex.org/W3046714359,"In eukaryotic cells, phospholipid flippases translocate phospholipids from the exoplasmic to the cytoplasmic leaflet of the lipid bilayer. Budding yeast contains five flippases, of which Cdc50p-Drs2p and Neo1p are primarily involved in membrane trafficking in endosomes and Golgi membranes. The ANY1/CFS1 gene was identified as a suppressor of growth defects in the neo1Δ and cdc50Δ mutants. Cfs1p is a membrane protein of the PQ-loop family and is localized to endosomal/Golgi membranes, but its relationship to phospholipid asymmetry remains unknown. The neo1Δ cfs1Δ mutant appears to function normally in membrane trafficking but may function abnormally in the regulation of phospholipid asymmetry. To identify a gene that is functionally relevant to NEO1 and CFS1, we isolated a mutation that is synthetically lethal with neo1Δ cfs1Δ and identified ERD1. Erd1p is a Golgi membrane protein that is involved in the transport of phosphate (Pi) from the Golgi lumen to the cytoplasm. The Neo1p-depleted cfs1Δ erd1Δ mutant accumulated plasma membrane proteins in the Golgi, perhaps due to a lack of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate. The Neo1p-depleted cfs1Δ erd1Δ mutant also exhibited abnormal structure of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and induced an unfolded protein response, likely due to defects in the retrieval pathway from the cis-Golgi region to the ER. Genetic analyses suggest that accumulation of Pi in the Golgi lumen is responsible for defects in Golgi functions in the Neo1p-depleted cfs1Δ erd1Δ mutant. Thus, the luminal ionic environment is functionally relevant to phospholipid asymmetry. Our results suggest that flippase-mediated phospholipid redistribution and luminal Pi concentration coordinately regulate Golgi membrane functions."
https://openalex.org/W3046734654,"Physical impairments are common in uraemia, as reflected by the high risk of falls of haemodialysis (HD) patients. Furthermore, these patients often suffer from malnutrition.Up to now, it is unknown which aspects of physical performance are predominantly driven by malnutrition in HD patients. As this answer could steer different interventions, the aim of this study was to evaluate the cross-sectional relationship between nutritional status, muscle strength, exercise capacity and the risk of falls.This study recruited HD patients between December 2016 and March 2018 from two hospital-based and five satellite dialysis units (registration number on clinicaltrial.gov: NCT03910426). The mini-nutritional assessment scale as well as objective measures of protein-energy wasting were obtained (total iron-binding capacity, total protein levels, and CRP). Physical assessment included muscle strength (quadriceps, handgrip force, and sit-to-stand test), exercise capacity (six-minute walking test) and the risk of falls (Tinetti, FICSIT, and dialysis fall index). Their interrelationship was analysed by ridge regression models.Out of 113 HD patients (mean age 67 years ± 16.1, 57.5% male) 36.3% were malnourished according to the mini-nutritional assessment scale and a majority had impaired quadriceps force (86.7%), six-minute walking test (92%), and an increased risk of falls (73.5%). Total protein and CRP levels were identified as relevant nutritional factors in the association with physical performance. Nutritional parameters explained 9.2% of the variance in the risk of falls and 7.6% of the variance in exercise capacity. No conclusive association was found between nutritional status and muscle strength.Protein-energy wasting is a determinant of the risk of falls and exercise capacity in patients on HD. The association between malnutrition and muscle weakness remains inconclusive."
https://openalex.org/W3046744139,Effective biofilm removal from surfaces in the mouth is a clinical challenge. Cavitation bubbles generated around a dental ultrasonic scaler are being investigated as a method to remove biofilms effectively. It is not known how parameters such as surface roughness and instrument distance from biofilm affect the removal. We grew Strepotococcus sanguinis biofilms on coverslips and titanium discs with varying surface roughness (between 0.02–3.15 μm). Experimental studies were carried out for the biofilm removal using high speed imaging and image analysis to calculate the area of biofilm removed at varying ultrasonic scaler standoff distances from the biofilm. We found that surface roughness up to 2 μm does not adversely affect biofilm removal but a surface roughness of 3 μm caused less biofilm removal. The standoff distance also has different effects depending on the surface roughness but overall a distance of 1 mm is just as effective as a distance of 0.5 mm. The results show significant biofilm removal due to an ultrasonic scaler tip operating for only 2s versus 15-60s in previous studies. The technique developed for high speed imaging and image analysis of biofilm removal can be used to investigate physical biofilm disruption from biomaterial surfaces in other fields.
https://openalex.org/W3046750280,"Repeated exposures to environmental allergens in susceptible individuals drive the development of type 2 inflammatory conditions such as asthma, which have been traditionally considered to be mainly mediated by Th2 cells. However, emerging evidence suggest that a new innate cell type, group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2), plays a central role in initiating and amplifying a type 2 response, even in the absence of adaptive immunity. At present, the regulatory mechanisms for controlling ILC2 activation remain poorly understood. Here we report that respiratory delivery of immunogenic extracellular RNA (exRNAs) derived from RNA- and DNA-virus infected cells, was able to activate a protective response against acute type 2 lung immunopathology and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) induced by IL-33 and a fungal allergen, A. flavus, in mice. Mechanistically, we found that the innate immune responses triggered by exRNAs had a potent suppressive effect in vivo on the proliferation and function of ILC2 without the involvement of adaptive immunity. We further provided the loss-of-function genetic evidence that the TLR3- and MAVS-mediated signaling axis is essential for the inhibitory effects of exRNAs in mouse lungs. Thus, our results indicate that the host detection of extracellular immunostimulatory RNAs generated during respiratory viral infections have an important function in the regulation of ILC2-driven acute lung inflammation."

Recurrent outbreaks of ranavirus disease and mortality affecting three species have occurred at a small reservoir in north-west Spain but no data were available on occurrence of the pathogen in the other amphibian and reptile species present or at adjacent sites. We sampled nine species of amphibians and reptiles at the reservoir and nearby sites and screened for ranavirus presence using molecular methods. Our results show infection with ranavirus in all nine species, including first reports for Hyla molleri, Pelophylax perezi, Rana iberica, and Podarcis bocagei. We detected ranavirus in all four local sites and confirmed mass mortality incidents involving Lissotriton boscai and Triturus marmoratus were ongoing. The reservoir regularly hosts water sports tournaments and the risks of ranavirus dispersal through the translocation of contaminated equipment are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3046825061,"Fluorescent markers are a powerful tool and have been widely applied in biology for different purposes. The genome sequence of Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri (X. citri) revealed that approximately 30% of the genes encoded hypothetical proteins, some of which could play an important role in the success of plant-pathogen interaction and disease triggering. Therefore, revealing their functions is an important strategy to understand the bacterium pathways and mechanisms involved in plant-host interaction. The elucidation of protein function is not a trivial task, but the identification of the subcellular localization of a protein is key to understanding its function. We have constructed an integrative vector, pMAJIIc, under the control of the arabinose promoter, which allows the inducible expression of red fluorescent protein (mCherry) fusions in X. citri, suitable for subcellular localization of target proteins. Fluorescence microscopy was used to track the localization of VrpA protein, which was visualized surrounding the bacterial outer membrane, and the GyrB protein, which showed a diffused cytoplasmic localization, sometimes with dots accumulated near the cellular poles. The integration of the vector into the amy locus of X. citri did not affect bacterial virulence. The vector could be stably maintained in X. citri, and the disruption of the α-amylase gene provided an ease screening method for the selection of the transformant colonies. The results demonstrate that the mCherry-containing vector here described is a powerful tool for bacterial protein localization in cytoplasmic and periplasmic environments."

Although current processes primarily involve chemical and physical approaches, the biological breakdown of lignin using enzymes and microorganisms is quickly becoming an interesting eco-friendly alternative to classical processes. As a result, bioprospection of wild fungi from naturally occurring lignin-rich sources remains a suitable method to uncover and isolate new species exhibiting ligninolytic activity. In this study, wild species of white rot fungi were collected from Colombian forests based on their natural wood decay ability and high capacity to secrete oxidoreductases with high affinity for phenolic polymers such as lignin. Based on high activity obtained from solid-state fermentation using a lignocellulose source from oil palm as matrix, we describe the isolation and whole-genome sequencing of Dictyopanus pusillus, a wild basidiomycete fungus exhibiting ABTS oxidation as an indication of laccase activity. Functional characterization of a crude enzymatic extract identified laccase activity as the main enzymatic contributor to fungal extracts, an observation supported by the identification of 13 putative genes encoding for homologous laccases in the genome. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first report of an enzymatic extract exhibiting laccase activity in the Dictyopanus genera, offering means to exploit this species and its enzymes for the delignification process of lignocellulosic by-products from oil palm."
https://openalex.org/W3046315508,"Each resident-type (R-type) killer whale pod has a set of stereotyped calls that are culturally transmitted from mother to offspring. The functions of particular call types are not yet clearly understood, but it is believed that calls with two independently modulated frequency components (biphonic calls) play an important role in pod communication and cohesion at long ranges. In this study we examined the possible functions of biphonic calls in R-type killer whales. First, we tested the hypothesis that the additional component enhances the potential of a call to identify the family affiliation. We found that the similarity patterns of the lower- and higher frequency components across the families were largely unrelated. Calls were classified more accurately to their respective family when both lower- and higher-frequency components were considered. Second, we tested the long-range detectability of the lower- and higher-frequency components. After adjusting the received levels by the killer whale hearing sensitivity to different frequency ranges, the sensation level of the higher-frequency component was higher than the amplitude of the lower-frequency component. Our results suggest that the higher-frequency component of killer whale biphonic calls varies independently of the lower-frequency component, which enhances the efficiency of these calls as family markers. The acoustic variation of the higher-frequency component allows the recognition of family identity of a caller even if the shape of the lower-frequency component accidentally becomes similar in unrelated families. The higher-frequency component can also facilitate family recognition when the lower-frequency component is masked by low-frequency noise."
https://openalex.org/W3046457845,"This paper provides a general framework for controlling quality characteristics related to control variables and limited to the intervals (0, 1], [0, 1), or [0, 1]. The proposed control chart is based on the inflated beta regression model considering a reparametrization of the inflated beta distribution indexed by the response mean, which is useful for modeling fractions and proportions. The contribution of the paper is twofold. First, we extend the inflated beta regression model by allowing a regression structure for the precision parameter. We also present closed-form expressions for the score vector and Fisher's information matrix. Second, based on the proposed regression model, we introduce a new model-based control chart. The control limits are obtained considering the estimates of the inflated beta regression model parameters. We conduct a Monte Carlo simulation study to evaluate the performance of the proposed regression model estimators, and the performance of the proposed control chart is evaluated in terms of run length distribution. Finally, we present and discuss an empirical application to show the applicability of the proposed regression control chart."

This study investigated the potential association between adenotonsillectomy and the development of asthma and upper respiratory infections (URI). This propensity score-matched retrospective cohort study utilized data from the National Sample Cohort 2002–2013. In the asthma cohort, we used a Cox-proportional hazards model to analyze the hazard ratio (HR) of adenotonsillectomy for asthma events. In the URI cohort, equivalence testing of postoperative visits for URI was performed. The margin of equivalence of the difference was set at -0.5–0.5. Asthma incidence was 66.97/1000 person-years in children who underwent adenotonsillectomy and 30.43/1000 person-years in those who did not. Adjusted asthma HRs were 2.25 (95% confidence interval, 1.96–2.57) in the adenotonsillectomy vs. non-adenotonsillectomy groups. In a subgroup analysis, children aged 5–9 years living in metropolitan areas showed a higher incidence of subsequent asthma than those of other ages and areas. However, any significant difference between the groups in terms of URI events in the 1–11-year postoperative period was not identified. Adenotonsillectomy in children is associated with an increased incidence of asthma, with no significant impact on postoperative visits for URI."

However, there is no gold standard for the tape tension used during a KT application. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of KT application with different tension intensities on soleus muscle Hoffmann-reflex (H-reflex) modulation during lying and standing postures. Fifteen healthy university students were tested with 3 tape tension intensities during separate visits with a randomized sequence: tape-on no tension (0KT), moderate (about 50% of the maximal tape tension: (ModKT), and maximal tape tension (MaxKT). During each experimental visit, the H-reflex measurements on the soleus muscle were taken before, during, and after the KT application for both lying and standing postures. The H-wave and M-wave recruitment curves were generated using surface electromyography (EMG). There was a main effect for posture (p = 0.001) for the maximal peak-to-peak amplitude of the H-wave and M-wave (Hmax/Mmax) ratio, showing the depressed Hmax/Mmax ratio during standing, when compared to the lying posture. Even though the tension factor had a large effect (ηp2 = 0.165), different tape tensions showed no significant differential effects for the Hmax/Mmax ratio. The spinal motoneuron excitability was not altered, even during the maximal tension KT application on the soleus muscle. Thus, the tension used during a KT application should not be a concern in terms of modulating the sensorimotor activity ascribed to elastic taping during lying and standing postures."

At the present stage, symbiotic relations and evolutionary trends in a symbiotic system for fresh agricultural product supply chains lack quantitative methods for determining symbiotic criteria. In the sense of quantification -oriented criteria, symbiotic systems for fresh agricultural product supply chains are defined, and an improved stationary state analysis method is proposed. Three key steps in this method are quantifying a symbiotic energy model with an evaluation model of ecological carrying capacity, setting up a system evolution model based on the logistic growth function, and verifying the symbiotic system's singularity and phase transition boundary by Lyapunov indirect method. MATLAB numerical simulation shows that types of singularity and the phase transition boundary of symbiotic system are divided effectively. And in both conditions, infinite exponential growth and convergence to steady state, the mutualism mode is the optimal choice for the symbiotic system we defined, symbiotic relations between farmers and cooperative companies are stable and long-term at this time. Those conclusions provide a reference approach to enhance the overall prospective benefits to the fresh agricultural products supply chain."
https://openalex.org/W3046331051,"Perimeter control is an emerging alternative for traffic signal control, which regulates the traffic flows on the periphery of a road network. Some model-based approaches have been suggested earlier for the optimization of perimeter control based on macroscopic fundamental diagrams (MFDs). However, there are several limitations when considering their application to a large-scale urban area because the model-based approaches may not be scalable to multiple regions and inappropriate for handling various effects caused by the shape change of MFDs. Therefore, we propose a model-free and data-driven approach that combines reinforcement learning (RL) with the macroscopic traffic simulation based on the recently developed network transmission model. First, we design four perimeter control models with different macroscopic traffic variables and parametrizations. Then, we validate the proposed models by evaluating their performances with the test demand scenarios at different levels. The validation results show that the model containing travel demand information adapts to a new demand scenario better than the model containing only density-related factors."
https://openalex.org/W3046736360,"Background There is currently no standardized method for measuring functional status in knee osteoarthritis (OA) patients, despite that it is one of the top priorities when determining eligibility for total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The purpose of the current investigation was to identify factors associated with discordance between individual self-report and performance-based measures of function for obese and non-obese men and women with knee OA. Methods In a cohort of 727 knee OA patients scheduled for TKA, physical function prior to surgery was assessed with the self-reported physical function subscale of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC-pf), and the performance-based Timed Up and Go (TUG). Data on sociodemographic characteristics, health status, knee pain intensity, symptomatic joint site count, and pain catastrophizing were collected via questionnaire. The primary outcome was the difference in rescaled score between a participant’s self-report and performance-based measures of function. Multivariable linear regression stratified by sex and obesity status was used to identify factors associated with discordance. Results The mean age of participants was 65.5 years and 55% were women. With younger age, self-reported scores indicated increasingly worse function compared to performance-based scores, regardless of sex or obesity status. Among non-obese individuals, greater knee pain intensity was associated with a participant’s self-report score indicating increasingly worse function compared to their performance-based score. For obese women, pain catastrophizing, and number of symptomatic joints were also associated with discordance as was reporting fewer comorbidities. Conclusions Physical function may be differentially represented by self-reported and performance-based measures depending on a variety of patient factors. Our findings add to the evidence which suggests both measures should be used when assessing functional status prior to TKA."
https://openalex.org/W3046329872,"Heart failure (HF) impairs diaphragm function. Animal models realistically mimicking HF should feature both the cardiac alterations and the diaphragmatic dysfunction characterizing this disease. The isoproterenol-induced HF model is widely used, but whether it presents diaphragmatic dysfunction is unknown. However, indirect data from research in other fields suggest that isoproterenol could increase diaphragm function. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the widespread rodent model of isoproterenol-induced HF results in increased diaphragmatic contractility. Forty C57BL/6J male mice were randomized into 2 groups: HF and healthy controls. After 30 days of isoproterenol infusion to establish HF, in vivo diaphragmatic excursion and ex vivo isolated diaphragm contractibility were measured. As compared with healthy controls, mice with isoproterenol-induced HF showed the expected changes in structural and functional echocardiographic parameters and lung edema. isoproterenol-induced HF increased in vivo diaphragm excursion (by ≈30%, p<0.01) and increased by ≈50% both ex vivo peak specific force (p<0.05) and tetanic force (p<0.05) at almost all 10–100 Hz frequencies (p<0.05), with reduced fatigue resistance (p<0.01) when compared with healthy controls. Expression of myosin genes encoding the main muscle fiber types revealed that Myh4 was higher in isoproterenol-induced HF than in healthy controls (p<0.05), suggesting greater distribution of type IIb fibers. These results show that the conventional isoproterenol-induced HF model increases diaphragm contraction, a finding contrary to what is observed in patients with HF. Therefore, this specific model seems limited for translational an integrative HF research, especially when cardio-respiratory interactions are investigated."
https://openalex.org/W3046386477,"Stem cells, with their capacity to self-renew and to differentiate to more specialized cell types, play a key role to maintain homeostasis in adult tissues. To investigate how, in the dynamic stochastic environment of a tissue, non-genetic diversity and the precise balance between proliferation and differentiation are achieved, it is necessary to understand the molecular mechanisms of the stem cells in decision making process. By focusing on the impact of stochasticity, we proposed a computational model describing the regulatory circuitry as a tri-stable dynamical system to reveal the mechanism which orchestrate this balance. Our model explains how the distribution of noise in genes, linked to the cell regulatory networks, affects cell decision-making to maintain homeostatic state. The noise effect on tissue homeostasis is achieved by regulating the probability of differentiation and self-renewal through symmetric and/or asymmetric cell divisions. Our model reveals, when mutations due to the replication of DNA in stem cell division, are inevitable, how mutations contribute to either aging gradually or the development of cancer in a short period of time. Furthermore, our model sheds some light on the impact of more complex regulatory networks on the system robustness against perturbations."

The study also examined age-related changes on cloze probabilities, and specified the predictor effects of age and cloze probabilities on idiosyncratic responses and errors (semantic, syntactic, and other errors). Finally, the study also aimed to shed light on cultural effects on word generation by comparing Brazilian and Portuguese sentence databases.361 typically developing monolingual Brazilian speakers, with ages ranging from 7 to 18 years, participated in the study. The cloze task was composed by 100 sentence contexts, grounded on the European Portuguese database. Responses were classified as valid (correct) or invalid (semantic, syntactic, and other-type errors). Statistical analyses were based on mixed-effects logistic models.Sixty-three sentences met criteria for high cloze probabilities, 30 for medium cloze, and 7 for low cloze. Age was a significant predictor of idiosyncratic responses, semantic and syntactic errors: older participants were less likely to produce idiosyncratic responses, as well as semantic and syntactic errors. Cloze probability values were concordant in the Brazilian and Portuguese databases for 31 out of 49 (83.7%) high-cloze sentences and for 7 low-cloze sentences.In this study we have provided a database with cloze probability values for a set of 100 sentence-final word contexts for Brazilian Portuguese children and adolescents. Results showed that both age and sentence contextual level predicted sentence final word completion. Older participants were more likely to choose more consistently the same final word, with the contextual level of a given sentence also contributing to the final word selection. Age should be controlled for in future studies probing semantic processing with this set of sentences."

Beyond its role in APL tumorigenesis, PHRF1 contributes to non-homologous end-joining by linking H3K36 methylation and Nbs1 upon DNA damage insults. However, little is known regarding its function in tumor invasion. Here we highlight the unreported details of PHRF1 in the invasion of lung cancer cells by modulating the transcriptional level of ZEB1, a prominent regulator involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition. PHRF1 associated with the phosphorylated C-terminal repeat domain of Rpb1, the large subunit of RNA polymerase II, through its C-terminal Set2 Rpb1 Interacting (SRI) domain. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that PHRF1 bound to the proximal region adjacent to the transcription start site of ZEB1. SRI-deleted PHRF1 neither associated with Rpb1 nor increased ZEB1's expression. Collectively, PHRF1 might take the stage at migration and invasion by modulating the expression of ZEB1."
https://openalex.org/W3046354119,"Bodily movements representing abstract concepts (e.g., fluidity) can affect divergent creative thinking. A recent study showed that participants who performed fluid arm movements by tracing curved line-drawings (the fluid condition) subsequently generated a larger number of more original alternative uses for newspapers than did those who traced angular line-drawings (the non-fluid condition). This suggests that fluid movements enhance fluency and originality in divergent creative thinking. To replicate these findings, we employed the same task with a larger Japanese sample. Participants in the fluid condition generated more uses for newspapers than in the non-fluid condition, regardless of confounding variables: mood, subjective difficulty of the tracing, and daily use of newspapers. In contrast to previous findings, there were no effects on originality. Our results suggest that fluidity enacted by arm movements robustly enhances creative fluency, although other factors (e.g., culture) could interfere with its effect on originality."
https://openalex.org/W3046584415,"This study compares how lexical inferencing and dictionary consultation affect L2 vocabulary acquisition. Sixty-one L1 Arabic undergraduates majoring in English language read target words in semi-authentic English reading materials and were either asked to guess their meaning or look it up in a dictionary. A pre- and delayed post-test measured participants' knowledge of target words and overall vocabulary size. The results show a significant and comparable learning effect for both vocabulary learning strategies (VLS), with a higher pre-test vocabulary size related to a larger learning effect for both VLS. In addition, the better participants were at guessing correctly, the better they learned words through inferencing. The results suggest that both VLS are equally effective for our learner group and that learners' overall vocabulary size influences the amount of learning that occurs when using these VLS."

However, our understanding of the linkages among groundwater, food, and climate is still limited. Here, we offer a Bayesian framework to simulate crop yield at a regional scale and quantify its relationships and associated uncertainty with climate, groundwater, agricultural, and energy-related variables. We implemented the framework in the rice-producing regions of Louisiana from 1960-2015. To build a parsimonious model, we used a probability-based variable selection approach to detect the key drivers of rice yield. Rice yield increased, groundwater declined, and area planted declined or did not change over 56yrs. The number of irrigation wells, groundwater level, air temperature, and area planted were found to be the key drivers of rice yield. The regression coefficients showed that rice yield was positively related to groundwater level, and negatively related to area planted and the number of irrigation wells. The limited influence of N fertilizer was noted on rice yield for the period when fertilizer data were available. The inverse relationship between rice yield and area planted pointed to the adaption of efficient crop management practices that maintained or increased yield, despite the decline in area planted. The farmers' ability to install irrigation wells during droughts sustained the yields over long-term but not short-term. This decline in rice yield in response to drought over the short-term might explain the negative relation between yield and irrigation wells. Overall, this work highlighted the uncertainty in relationships between rice yield and key drivers and quantified the intimate connection between food and groundwater. This work may have implications for managing two highly competing commodities (i.e., groundwater and food) in agricultural regions."
https://openalex.org/W3046909076,"The soilborne fungus Gaeumannomyces tritici (G. tritici) causes the take-all disease on wheat roots. Ambient pH has been shown to be critical in different steps of G. tritici life cycle such as survival in bulk soil, saprophytic growth, and pathogenicity on plants. There are however intra-specific variations and we previously found two types of G. tritici strains that grow preferentially either at acidic pH or at neutral/alkaline pH; gene expression involved in pH-signal transduction pathway and pathogenesis was differentially regulated in two strains representative of these types. To go deeper in the description of the genetic pathways and the understanding of this adaptative mechanism, transcriptome sequencing was achieved on two strains (PG6 and PG38) which displayed opposite growth profiles in two pH conditions (acidic and neutral). PG6, growing better at acidic pH, overexpressed in this condition genes related to cell proliferation. In contrast, PG38, which grew better at neutral pH, overexpressed in this condition genes involved in fatty acids and amino acid metabolisms, and genes potentially related to pathogenesis. This strain also expressed stress resistance mechanisms at both pH, to assert a convenient growth under various ambient pH conditions. These differences in metabolic pathway expression between strains at different pH might buffer the effect of field or soil variation in wheat fields, and explain the success of the pathogen."
