https://openalex.org/W2067117419,"The platinum chemotherapeutics such as cisplatin and carboplatin are in clinical use in patients with BRCA2-mutated ovarian cancer. The initial response is generally good but most ovarian carcinomas ultimately become resistant to therapy. Two papers in this issue have identified a possible cause of this resistance as further mutation of the BRCA2 gene. Mutations in BRCA2 are associated with familial breast and ovarian cancer. Loss of BRCA2 function impairs DNA repair by homologous recombination and renders cells particular sensitive to cisplatin and also to PARP (poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase) inhibitors. The secondary 'resistance' mutations act by restoring the wild-type BRCA2 reading frame. Ovarian carcinomas with mutations in the tumour suppressor BRCA2 are particularly sensitive to platinum compounds1. However, such carcinomas ultimately develop cisplatin resistance. The mechanism of that resistance is largely unknown2. Here we show that acquired resistance to cisplatin can be mediated by secondary intragenic mutations in BRCA2 that restore the wild-type BRCA2 reading frame. First, in a cisplatin-resistant BRCA2-mutated breast-cancer cell line, HCC1428, a secondary genetic change in BRCA2 rescued BRCA2 function. Second, cisplatin selection of a BRCA2-mutated pancreatic cancer cell line, Capan-1 (refs 3, 4), led to five different secondary mutations that restored the wild-type BRCA2 reading frame. All clones with secondary mutations were resistant both to cisplatin and to a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor (AG14361). Finally, we evaluated recurrent cancers from patients whose primary BRCA2-mutated ovarian carcinomas were treated with cisplatin. The recurrent tumour that acquired cisplatin resistance had undergone reversion of its BRCA2 mutation. Our results suggest that secondary mutations that restore the wild-type BRCA2 reading frame may be a major clinical mediator of acquired resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy."

https://openalex.org/W2047200356,"We followed our initial genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 527,869 SNPs on 1,172 individuals with prostate cancer and 1,157 controls of European origin-nested in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial prospective study-by testing 26,958 SNPs in four independent studies (total of 3,941 cases and 3,964 controls). In the combined joint analysis, we confirmed three previously reported loci (two independent SNPs at 8q24 and one in HNF1B (formerly known as TCF2 on 17q); P < 10(-10)). In addition, loci on chromosomes 7, 10 (two loci) and 11 were highly significant (between P < 7.31 x 10(-13) and P < 2.14 x 10(-6)). Loci on chromosome 10 include MSMB, which encodes beta-microseminoprotein, a primary constituent of semen and a proposed prostate cancer biomarker, and CTBP2, a gene with antiapoptotic activity; the locus on chromosome 7 is at JAZF1, a transcriptional repressor that is fused by chromosome translocation to SUZ12 in endometrial cancer. Of the nine loci that showed highly suggestive associations (P < 2.5 x 10(-5)), four best fit a recessive model and included candidate susceptibility genes: CPNE3, IL16 and CDH13. Our findings point to multiple loci with moderate effects associated with susceptibility to prostate cancer that, taken together, in the future may predict high risk in select individuals."

https://openalex.org/W1481795283,"Terminally misfolded or unassembled proteins in the early secretory pathway are degraded by a ubiquitin- and proteasome-dependent process known as ER-associated degradation (ERAD). How substrates of this pathway are recognized within the ER and delivered to the cytoplasmic ubiquitin-conjugating machinery is unknown. We report here that OS-9 and XTP3-B/Erlectin are ER-resident glycoproteins that bind to ERAD substrates and, through the SEL1L adaptor, to the ER-membrane-embedded ubiquitin ligase Hrd1. Both proteins contain conserved mannose 6-phosphate receptor homology (MRH) domains, which are required for interaction with SEL1L, but not with substrate. OS-9 associates with the ER chaperone GRP94 which, together with Hrd1 and SEL1L, is required for the degradation of an ERAD substrate, mutant alpha(1)-antitrypsin. These data suggest that XTP3-B and OS-9 are components of distinct, partially redundant, quality control surveillance pathways that coordinate protein folding with membrane dislocation and ubiquitin conjugation in mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W2045565089,"An international initiative is developing a scientifically rigorous approach to evaluate the potential risks to nontarget arthropods (NTAs) posed by insect-resistant, genetically modified (IRGM) crops. It adapts the tiered approach to risk assessment that is used internationally within regulatory toxicology and environmental sciences. The approach focuses on the formulation and testing of clearly stated risk hypotheses, making maximum use of available data and using formal decision guidelines to progress between testing stages (or tiers). It is intended to provide guidance to regulatory agencies that are currently developing their own NTA risk assessment guidelines for IRGM crops and to help harmonize regulatory requirements between different countries and different regions of the world."
https://openalex.org/W1977605312,"Hemoproteins are critical for the function and integrity of aerobic cells. However, free heme is toxic. Therefore, cells must balance heme synthesis with its use. We previously demonstrated that the feline leukemia virus, subgroup C, receptor (FLVCR) exports cytoplasmic heme. Here, we show that FLVCR-null mice lack definitive erythropoiesis, have craniofacial and limb deformities resembling those of patients with Diamond-Blackfan anemia, and die in midgestation. Mice with FLVCR that is deleted neonatally develop a severe macrocytic anemia with proerythroblast maturation arrest, which suggests that erythroid precursors export excess heme to ensure survival. We further demonstrate that FLVCR mediates heme export from macrophages that ingest senescent red cells and regulates hepatic iron. Thus, the trafficking of heme, and not just elemental iron, facilitates erythropoiesis and systemic iron balance."

https://openalex.org/W2167668539,"Disruption of signaling pathways such as those mediated by sonic hedgehog (Shh) or platelet-derived growth factor (Pdgf) causes craniofacial abnormalities, including cleft palate. The role that microRNAs play in modulating palatogenesis, however, is completely unknown. We show that, in zebrafish, the microRNA Mirn140 negatively regulates Pdgf signaling during palatal development, and we provide a mechanism for how disruption of Pdgf signaling causes palatal clefting. The pdgf receptor alpha (pdgfra) 3′ UTR contained a Mirn140 binding site functioning in the negative regulation of Pdgfra protein levels in vivo. pdgfra mutants and Mirn140-injected embryos shared a range of facial defects, including clefting of the crest-derived cartilages that develop in the roof of the larval mouth. Concomitantly, the oral ectoderm beneath where these cartilages develop lost pitx2 and shha expression. Mirn140 modulated Pdgf-mediated attraction of cranial neural crest cells to the oral ectoderm, where crest-derived signals were necessary for oral ectodermal gene expression. Mirn140 loss of function elevated Pdgfra protein levels, altered palatal shape and caused neural crest cells to accumulate around the optic stalk, a source of the ligand Pdgfaa. These results suggest that the conserved regulatory interactions of mirn140 and pdgfra define an ancient mechanism of palatogenesis, and they provide candidate genes for cleft palate."
https://openalex.org/W2133507210,"A basic question in the field of motor control is how different actions are represented by activity in spinal projection neurons. We used a new behavioral assay to identify visual stimuli that specifically drive basic motor patterns in zebrafish. These stimuli evoked consistent patterns of neural activity in the neurons projecting to the spinal cord, which we could map throughout the entire population using in vivo two-photon calcium imaging. We found that stimuli that drive distinct behaviors activated distinct subsets of projection neurons, consisting, in some cases, of just a few cells. This stands in contrast to the distributed activation seen for more complex behaviors. Furthermore, targeted cell by cell ablations of the neurons associated with evoked turns abolished the corresponding behavioral response. This description of the functional organization of the zebrafish motor system provides a framework for identifying the complete circuit underlying a vertebrate behavior."

https://openalex.org/W2029651747,"β-Amyloid (Aβ) peptides that accumulate in Alzheimer disease are generated from the β-amyloid precursor protein (βAPP) by cleavages by β-secretase BACE1 and by presenilin-dependent γ-secretase activities. Very few data document a putative cross-talk between these proteases and the regulatory mechanisms underlying such interaction. We show that presenilin deficiency lowers BACE1 maturation and affects both BACE1 activity and promoter transactivation. The specific γ-secretase inhibitor DFK167 triggers the decrease of BACE1 activity in wild-type but not in presenilin-deficient fibroblasts. This decrease is also elicited by catalytically inactive γ-secretase. The overexpression of APP intracellular domain (AICD), the γ/ϵ-secretase-derived C-terminal product of β-amyloid precursor protein, does not modulate BACE1 activity or promoter transactivation in fibroblasts and does not alter BACE1 expression in AICD transgenic brains of mice. A DFK167-sensitive increase of BACE1 activity is observed in cells overexpressing APPϵ (the N-terminal product of βAPP generated by ϵ-secretase cleavage harboring the Aβ domain but lacking the AICD sequence), suggesting that the production of Aβ could account for the modulation of BACE1. Accordingly, we show that HEK293 cells overexpressing wild-type βAPP exhibit a DFK167-sensitive increase in BACE1 promoter transactivation that is increased by the Aβ-potentiating Swedish mutation. This effect was mimicked by exogenous application of Aβ42 but not Aβ40 or by transient transfection of cDNA encoding Aβ42 sequence. The IκB kinase inhibitor BMS345541 prevents Aβ-induced BACE1 promoter transactivation suggesting that NFκB could mediate this Aβ-associated phenotype. Accordingly, the overexpression of wild-type or Swedish mutated βAPP does not modify the transactivation of BACE1 promoter constructs lacking NFκB-responsive element. Furthermore, APP/β-amyloid precursor protein-like protein deficiency does not affect BACE1 activity and expression. Overall, these data suggest that physiological levels of endogenous Aβ are not sufficient per se to modulate BACE1 promoter transactivation but that exacerbated Aβ production linked to wild-type or Swedish mutated βAPP overexpression modulates BACE1 promoter transactivation and activity via an NFκB-dependent pathway. β-Amyloid (Aβ) peptides that accumulate in Alzheimer disease are generated from the β-amyloid precursor protein (βAPP) by cleavages by β-secretase BACE1 and by presenilin-dependent γ-secretase activities.

The increase of cerebral Aβ levels is one of the common denominators characterizing both sporadic and familial forms of AD and therefore, if not demonstrated as the etiological cause of AD pathology, is often considered as a key factor contributing to the degenerative process (1Hardy J.A.

The mechanisms by which Aβ peptides are generated are a matter of intense research in the AD field. Aβ peptides are released from a transmembrane protein, β-amyloid precursor protein (βAPP), by the sequential attacks by β- and γ-secretase that liberate the N- and C-terminal moieties of Aβ peptides, respectively (2Checler F.

BACE1 is a type I transmembrane protein that undergoes several post-transductional modifications. BACE1 is N-glycosylated in its ectodomain where six cysteine residues form intramolecular disulfide bridges (14Haniu M. Denis P. Young Y. Mendiaz E.A. Fuller J. Hui J.O. Bennett B.D. Kahn S. Ross S.

Immature glycosylated BACE1 rapidly undergoes a furin-mediated removal of its pro-domain (15Bennett B.D. Denis P. Haniu M. Teplow D.B. Kahn S. Louis J-C. Citron M. Vassar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37712-37717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) to generate the 70-kDa mature form of the enzyme. Mature BACE1 also undergoes palmitoylation at three cysteine residues and sulfation of N-glycosylated moieties (16Benjannet S. Elagoz A. Wickham L. Mamarbachi M. Munzer J.S. Basak A. Lazure C.

Of most importance, BACE1 depletion leads to full impairment of Aβ production and is apparently safe (17Roberds S.L. Anderson J. Basi G. Bienkowski M.J. Branstetter D.G. Chen K.S. Freedman S.B. Frigon N.L. Games D. Hu K. Johnson-Wood K. Kappenman K.E. Kawabe T.T. Kola I. Kuehn R. Lee M. Liu W. Motter R. Nichols N.F. Power M. Robertson D.W. Schenk D. Schoor M. Shopp G.M. Shuck M.E. Sinha S.

Thus, invalidated embryos are viable whereas adult BACE1-/- mice are fertile. Although recent data indicate that BACE1 could have other substrates besides βAPP, which could be involved in important myelination processes (19Hu X. Hicks C.W. He W. Wong P. Macklin W.B. Trapp B.D. Yan R. Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 1520-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 20Willem M. Garratt A.N. Novak B. Citron M. Kaufmann S. Rittger A. DeStrooper B. Saftig P. Birchmeier C. Haass C. Science. 2006; 314: 664-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar), the above data identify BACE1 as a suitable therapeutic target. PS belong to the high molecular weight γ-secretase complex, which also includes Aph-1, Pen-2, and nicastrin (21De Strooper B. Neuron. 2003; 38: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar, 22Haass C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 483-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Besides their contribution to the intramembranous cleavage of βAPP, PS participate in the proteolytic activation/degradation of a series of other substrates involved in many vital functions (23Thinakaran G. Parent A.T. Pharmacol. Res. 2004; 50: 411-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), thereby explaining the apparent remarkable pleiotropy of these proteins (24Checler F. IUBMB Life. 1999; 48: 33-39Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among other functions, PS contribute to cellular adhesion, cell death control, and cell signaling (23Thinakaran G. Parent A.T. Pharmacol. Res. 2004; 50: 411-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 25Popescu B.O. Ankarcrona M. J. Alzheimer Dis. 2004; 6: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 26McCarthy J.V. Biochem.

Another remarkable property of PS concerns their ability to act as a molecular chaperone as was demonstrated for TrkB (27Naruse S. Thinakaran G. Luo J-J. Kusiak J.W. Iwatsubo T. Qian X. Ginty D.D.

Dis. 2003; 13: 238-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) demonstrated by yeast two-hybrid assay, co-immunoprecipitation procedure, and pulldown experiments that BACE1 and PS1 physically interacted. More recently, Kuzuya et al. (31Kuzuya A. Uemura K. Kitagawa N. Aoyagi N. Kihara T. Ninomiya H. Ishiura S. Takahashi R. Shimohama S. J. Neurosci. Res. 2007; 85: 153-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) established that PS1 could modulate BACE1 maturation. The above data agreed well with the demonstration that βAPP, PS1, and BACE1 co-localized in membrane vesicles that undergo axonal transport by a kinesin-dependent mechanism (32Kamal A. Almenar-Queralt A. LeBlanc J.F. Roberts E.A. Goldstein L.S.B. Nature. 2001; 414: 643-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). However, the functional cross-talk between the two partners and the mechanisms by which PS could control BACE1 activity remained elusive. Here we show that PS control the promoter transactivation of BACE1, and we establish that this PS-dependent effect is related to its associated γ-secretase activity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that BACE1 activity and promoter transactivation were directly linked to exacerbated production of Aβ and unrelated to AICD generation. Finally, we establish that Aβ-mediated transactivation of BACE1 promoter involves the NFκB pathway.

Briefly, samples (30 μg of proteins diluted in 10 mm acetate buffer, pH 4.5) were incubated in a final volume of 100 μl of the above acetate buffer containing BACE1 substrate (10 μm, (7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl)acetyl-SEVNLDAEFRK(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-RRNH2; R & D Systems) in the absence or presence of the previously described BACE1 inhibitor JMV2764 (50 μm) (39Lefranc-Jullien S.

HEK293 cells and fibroblasts devoid of presenilins were cultured in 12-well dishes or 60-mm-diameter dishes and transfected with 2 or 8 μg of the total amount of cDNA, respectively. For Aβ transfection experiments, cells were transfected with a total amount of 3 μg of cDNA encoding rat BACE1 promoter, β-galactosidase, and either empty vector or constructs harboring Aβ-(1-42), Aβ-(42-1), or Aβ-(1-40) (45Ohyagi Y.

Effect of Exogenous Αβ on BACE1 Promoter Transactivation—Twenty four hours after transfection of rat BACE1 promoter, medium was replaced with Opti-MEM medium (Sigma) containing fetal bovine serum (2%) and complemented with phosphoramidon (10 μm) to prevent Aβ degradation. The cells were then treated for 48 h with various concentrations of synthetic Aβ42 or Aβ40 (Bachem).

Analysis of Aβ40 Production—Cells were allowed to secrete Aβ in Opti-MEM medium (Sigma) for 8 or 16 h in the presence of phosphoramidon (10 μm) (to prevent the degradation of secreted Aβ), in the absence or in the presence of DFK167 (50 μm), collected, supplemented with RIPA buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, EDTA 5 mm, NaCl 150 mm), and then incubated overnight with a 100-fold dilution of FCA18 or FCA3340 (47Barelli H.

Aβ40 was immunoprecipitated with protein A-Sepharose, analyzed onto a 16.5% Tris/Tricine gel, Western blotted, and revealed with 6E10 as described previously (36Lefranc-Jullien S. Sunyach C. Checler F. J. Neurochem. 2006; 97: 807-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Stastistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was performed with Prism software (Graphpad, San Diego) using the Student-Newman-Keul's multiple comparison test for one-way analysis of variance or unpaired t test for pairwise comparison. Presenilin 1 and Presenilin 2 Deficiency Affects BACE1 Maturation, Activity, and Promoter Transactivation—We examined the influence of presenilins on the expression of BACE1. In wild-type fibroblasts, pro-BACE1 and mature BACE1 were detected at their previously reported molecular weights (Fig. 1A) (48Vassar R. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 157-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the depletion of both PS1 and PS2 lowers the level of mature BACE1 (44.4 ± 10.1% compared with control, n = 6, p < 0.01) without affecting pro-BACE1 (Fig. 1, B and C). In PS-deficient fibroblasts, an additional band harboring BACE-1-like immunoreactivity was detected above the mature form of the enzyme (Fig. 1A). The identity of this protein is still unknown, but we can rule out the possibility that this protein derives from abnormal prohormone convertase processing that would have occurred in the absence of PS because this protein remains totally insensitive to the convertase inhibitor α1-antitrypsin Portland variant (49Anderson E.D. Thomas L. Hayflick J.S. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24887-24891Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 50Benjannet S. Savaria D. Laslop A. Munzer J.S. Chrétien M. Marcinkiewicz M. Seidah N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26210-26218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar and data not shown). We examined whether PS deficiency-associated reduction of mature BACE1 expression was associated with a decrease of BACE1 enzymatic activity. Thus, the depletion of endogenous PS triggers a significant reduction of BACE1 activity (27.4 ± 4.8% compared with control, n = 6, p < 0.0001; see Fig. 1D). The similar decrease in both mature BACE1 expression and activity suggests that the above-described unidentified protein apparently does not harbor catalytic properties. Of most interest, we establish that fibroblasts devoid of PS display drastically lower BACE1 promoter transactivation (77.4 ± 7.4% compared with control, n = 9, p < 0.0001; see Fig. 1E). Overall, the above data suggested that PS modulate BACE1 activity by apparently controlling this protease at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Presenilin-dependent γ-Secretase Activity Is Involved in the Control of BACE1—We examined whether the modulation of BACE1 activity could be linked to the enzymatic activity displayed by the PS-dependent γ-secretase complex. Two distinct sets of experiments suggest that it is indeed the case. First, we assessed the influence of a double mutation thought to yield a catalytically inactive PS1 (D257A/D385A-PS1, AA-PS1 (51Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1692) Google Scholar)). Unlike wild-type PS1, which slightly increases BACE1 activity (Fig. 2B), AA-PS1 overexpression (Fig. 2A) reduces BACE1 activity (53.4 ± 8.2% compared with WT-PS1, n = 3, p < 0.01; Fig. 2B). Second, we assessed the influence of DFK167, a γ-secretase inhibitor that physically interacts with PS (52Esler W.P. Kimberly W.T. Ostaszewski B. Diehl T.S. Moore C.L. Tsai J-Y. Rahmati T. Xia W. Selkoe D.J. Wolfe M.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 428-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar), on BACE1 activity. As a matter of controls, we first show that DFK167 does not directly interfere with BACE1 activity (Fig. 3A) but indeed abolishes Aβ production in HEK293 cells expressing Swedish mutated βAPP (Fig. 3B). Clearly, DFK167 reduces cellular BACE1 activity in wild-type fibroblasts (40.9 ± 3.6% for 10 μm DFK167 and 46.9 ± 4% for 50 μm DFK167 compared with control untreated cells, n = 16, p < 0.001; Fig. 3C) as well as BACE1 expression (Fig. 3C). However, the γ-secretase inhibitor neither alters BACE1 expression nor activity in PS-deficient cells (Fig. 3D). Altogether, both mutational and pharmacological data indicate that PS-induced modulation of BACE1 activity was apparently linked to PS-associated γ-secretase activity.FIGURE 3Effect of the γ-secretase inhibitor DFK167 on BACE1 expression and activity in wild-type and PS-/- fibroblasts. A and B, DFK167 inhibits Aβ production but does not directly affect BACE1 activity in vitro. A, BACE1 activity was fluorimetrically monitored in PS+/+ homogenates in the absence (Ct) or in the presence of DFK167 (50 μm). B, HEK293 overexpressing Swedish mutated βAPP were incubated for 16 h with phosphoramidon (10 μm), in the absence (Ct) or in the presence of either DFK167 (50 μm) or corresponding amount of Me2SO (DMSO). Secreted Aβ was monitored after immunoprecipitation with FCA18 antibody and analyzed after 16.5% Tris/Tricine electrophoresis and Western blot with 6E10 antibody as described under “Materials and Methods.” PS+/+ (C) and PS-/- (D) fibroblasts were treated for 16 h with the indicated concentration of DFK167 or adequate amount of Me2SO (DMSO), and then endogenous BACE1 expression and activity were measured as described under “Materials and Methods.” Bars correspond to BACE1 activity expressed as percent of that observed in untreated cells (Me2SO, taken as 100) and are the means ± S.E. of 16 independent determinations. *, p < 0.001; ns, not statistically significant.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) AICDs Do Not Modulate BACE1 Activity, in Vitro and in Vivo—Because the modulation of BACE1 was apparently linked to PS-dependent catalytic events, we postulated that the control of BACE1 should involve catabolites generated by PS-dependent γ-secretase-associated processes and harboring transcription factor properties. In this context, we examined whether the C-terminal products of βAPP hydrolysis could contribute to the modulation of BACE1 activity. Thus, these fragments called AICD (APP intracellular domain) have been shown to be derived from DFK167-sensitive γ- and ϵ-secretase proteolytic cleavages (53Passer B. Pellegrini L. Russo C.

https://openalex.org/W2064550803,"Adenosine is a potent endogenous regulator of tissue repair that is released from injured cells and tissues. Hepatic fibrosis results from chronic hepatic injury, and we have previously reported that endogenously generated adenosine, acting at A(2A) receptors, plays a role in toxin-induced hepatic fibrosis. Adenosine may form intracellularly and then be transported to the extracellular space or it may form extracellularly from adenine nucleotides released from injured cells. Because ecto-5'-nucleotidase (CD73) catalyzes the terminal step in extracellular adenosine formation from AMP, we determined whether CD73 plays a role in the development of hepatic fibrosis. Mice were treated overnight with PBS, CCl(4), ethanol, or thioacetamide (TAA); their livers were harvested, and slices were incubated in medium for 20 h before adenosine concentration in the supernatant was measured by HPLC. Hepatic fibrosis was induced by CCl(4) or TAA treatment in CD73 knockout (CD73KO and C57BL/6 background) and C57BL/6 control mice [wild-type (WT)] mice and quantified by digital analysis of picrosirius red stained slides and hydroxyproline content. mRNA expression was quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction, and protein was quantified by Western blot or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Livers from WT mice treated with CCl(4), ethanol, and TAA released 2- to 3-fold higher levels of adenosine than livers from comparably treated CD73KO mice. CD73KO mice were protected from fibrosis with significantly less collagen content in the livers of CD73KO than WT mice after treatment with either CCl(4) or TAA. There were far fewer alpha-smooth muscle actin positive hepatic stellate cells in CCl(4)-treated KO mice than that in WT mice. After CCl(4) treatment, the mRNA level of A(1), A(2A), A(2B), and A(3) adenosine receptors, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL) -1beta, IL-13r alpha1, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-14, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP) -1, and TIMP-2, and IL-13 level increased markedly in both CD73KO and WT mice, but Col1 alpha1, Col3 alpha1, and transforming growth factor-beta1 mRNA increased much more in WT mice than that in KO mice. Moreover, IL-13r alpha2, MMP-13 mRNA, and MMP-13 protein were higher in KO mice than that in WT mice. These results indicate that adenosine, formed extracellularly from adenine nucleotides, plays a major role in the pathogenesis of hepatic fibrosis and that inhibition of adenosine production or blockade of adenosine receptors may help prevent hepatic fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W1988859803,"Oxidation of low density lipoprotein (LDL) occurs in vivo and significantly contributes to the development of atherosclerosis. An important mechanism of LDL oxidation in vivo is its modification with 12/15-lipoxygenase (LO). We have developed a model of minimally oxidized LDL (mmLDL) in which native LDL is modified by cells expressing 12/15LO. This mmLDL activates macrophages inducing membrane ruffling and cell spreading, activation of ERK1/2 and Akt signaling, and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. In this study, we found that many of the biological activities of mmLDL were associated with cholesteryl ester (CE) hydroperoxides and were diminished by ebselen, a reducing agent. Liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectroscopy demonstrated the presence of many mono- and polyoxygenated CE species in mmLDL but not in native LDL. Nonpolar lipid extracts of mmLDL activated macrophages, although to a lesser degree than intact mmLDL. The macrophage responses were also induced by LDL directly modified with immobilized 12/15LO, and the nonpolar lipids extracted from 12/15LO-modified LDL contained a similar set of oxidized CE. Cholesteryl arachidonate modified with 12/15LO also activated macrophages and contained a similar collection of oxidized CE molecules. Remarkably, many of these oxidized CE were found in the extracts of atherosclerotic lesions isolated from hyperlipidemic apoE(-/-) mice. These results suggest that CE hydroperoxides constitute a class of biologically active components of mmLDL that may be relevant to proinflammatory activation of macrophages in atherosclerotic lesions."
https://openalex.org/W2089342240,"c-Jun N-terminal kinases (SAPK/JNKs) are activated by inflammatory cytokines, and JNK signaling is involved in insulin resistance and beta-cell secretory function and survival. Chronic high glucose concentrations and leptin induce interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) secretion from pancreatic islets, an event that is possibly causal in promoting beta-cell dysfunction and death. The present study provides evidence that chronically elevated concentrations of leptin and glucose induce beta-cell apoptosis through activation of the JNK pathway in human islets and in insulinoma (INS 832/13) cells. JNK inhibition by the dominant inhibitor JNK-binding domain of IB1/JIP-1 (JNKi) reduced JNK activity and apoptosis induced by leptin and glucose. Exposure of human islets to leptin and high glucose concentrations leads to a decrease of glucose-induced insulin secretion, which was partly restored by JNKi. We detected an interplay between the JNK cascade and the caspase 1/IL-1beta-converting enzyme in human islets. The caspase 1 gene, which contains a potential activating protein-1 binding site, was up-regulated in pancreatic sections and in isolated islets from type 2 diabetic patients. Similarly, cultured human islets exposed to high glucose- and leptin-induced caspase 1 and JNK inhibition prevented this up-regulation. Therefore, JNK inhibition may protect beta-cells from the deleterious effects of high glucose and leptin in diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2093803942,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) induces phosphorylation of VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) and activates the downstream signaling pathway resulting in endothelial cell migration, proliferation, and survival. Cigarette smoking is associated with abnormal vascular and endothelial function, leading to airspace enlargement. Herein, we investigated the mechanism of cigarette smoke (CS) -induced endothelial dysfunction by studying the VEGF-VEGFR-2 signaling in mouse lung and human endothelial cells. CS exposure caused oxidative stress, as shown by increased levels of 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal-adducts in mouse lung and reactive oxygen species generation in human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC-Ls). Inhibition of VEGFR-2 by a specific kinase inhibitor (NVP-AAD777) enhanced the CS-induced oxidative stress, causing augmented inflammatory cell influx and proinflammatory mediators release in mouse lung. The levels of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and phosphorylated (p) -eNOS in the lungs of mice exposed to CS and/or treated with VEGFR-2 inhibitor were decreased. CS down-regulated VEGFR-2 expression, eNOS levels, and VEGF-induced VEGFR-2 phosphorylation in HMVEC-Ls, resulting in impaired VEGF-induced endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis. Overall, these data show that inhibition of VEGFR-2 augmented CS-induced oxidative stress and inflammatory responses leading to endothelial dysfunction. This explains the mechanism of endothelial dysfunction in smokers and has implications in understanding the pathogenesis of pulmonary and cardiovascular diseases."

https://openalex.org/W2080658486,"Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is influenced by a variety of stimuli, including exercise, but the mechanisms by which running affects neurogenesis are not yet fully understood. Because beta-endorphin, which is released in response to exercise, increases cell proliferation in vitro, we hypothesized that it could exert a similar effect in vivo and mediate the stimulatory effects of running on neurogenesis. We thus analyzed the effects of voluntary wheel-running on adult neurogenesis (proliferation, differentiation, survival/death) in wild-type and beta-endorphin-deficient mice. In wild-type mice, exercise promoted cell proliferation evaluated by sacrificing animals 24 h after the last 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) pulse and by using endogenous cell cycle markers (Ki67 and pH(3)). This was accompanied by an increased survival of 4-wk-old BrdU-labeled cells, leading to a net increase of neurogenesis. Beta-endorphin deficiency had no effect in sedentary mice, but it completely blocked the running-induced increase in cell proliferation; this blockade was accompanied by an increased survival of 4-wk-old cells and a decreased cell death. Altogether, adult neurogenesis was increased in response to exercise in knockout mice. We conclude that beta-endorphin released during running is a key factor for exercise-induced cell proliferation and that a homeostatic balance may regulate the final number of new neurons."

Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) is one of the most abundant ω-3 fatty acids in fish oil, but the mechanism(s) by which EPA exerts its beneficial effects is unknown. Recent studies, however, have demonstrated that oxidized EPA, rather than native EPA, possesses anti-atherosclerotic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-proliferative effects.

Unlike PGs, however, IsoPs have been shown to form in situ in phospholipids and are subsequently cleaved from phospholipid storage sites by phospholipases (11Morrow J.D. Awad J.A. Boss H.J.

It is well known that eicosanoids containing E- and D-type prostane rings are unstable and readily dehydrate in aqueous solutions to form cyclopentenone-containing compounds (13Fitzpatrick F.A. Wynalda M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11713-11718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previously we reported that, analogous to the formation of A-ring and J-ring PGs from the dehydration of the cyclooxygenase-generated PGE2 and PGD2, A2/J2-IsoPs as well as A4/J4-neuroprostanes (NPs), are generated in vitro and in vivo from the oxidation of arachidonic acid and docosohexaenoic acid (C22:6, ω-3; DHA), respectively (13Fitzpatrick F.A.

More recently, our laboratory has confirmed that F-ring IsoP-like compounds, termed F3-IsoPs, are also formed from the free radical-catalyzed peroxidation of EPA (16Gao L. Yin H. Milne G.L. Porter N.A. Morrow J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14092-14099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Based on these studies as well as our interest in the potential bioactivity of cyclopentenone-containing EPA oxidation products, we have hypothesized that, analogous to the formation of A2/J2-IsoPs from the oxidation of arachidonic acid, A- and J-ring IsoPs (A3/J3-IsoPs) can be generated from the oxidation of EPA in vitro and in vivo. A proposed mechanism of formation of A3/J3-IsoPs is shown in Fig. 1. There are four bis-allylic carbons in EPA at carbons 7, 10, 13, and 16 as opposed to only three bis-allylic carbons in arachidonic acid. Hydrogen abstraction can occur at each of these bis-allylic carbons and is followed by oxygen insertion. Depending on the site of oxygen insertion, one of eight different hydroperoxides are generated; these eight hydroperoxides are then further oxidized to yield six bicyclic endoperoxides that can then undergo ring arrangement to form 6-series of E3/D3-IsoPs. These products subsequently dehydrate to generate one of six different series of A3/J3-IsoPs. Each regioisomer is theoretically comprised of eight racemic diastereomers for a total of 48 compounds. A nomenclature system for the IsoPs has been established and approved by the Eicosanoid Nomenclature Committee in which each different regioisomer class is designated by the carbon number on which the side chain hydroxyl is located with the carboxyl carbon designated as C-1 (17Taber D.F. Morrow J.D. Roberts 2nd, L.J. Prostaglandins. 1997; 53: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Thus, in accordance with this nomenclature system, the A3/J3-IsoP regioisomers are designated as 5-, 8-, 11-, 12-, 15-, and 18-series A3/J3-IsoPs. Herein, we present evidence that A3/J3-IsoPs are, in fact, formed in significant amounts in vitro and in vivo from the free radical-catalyzed peroxidation of EPA. Materials—EPA was purchased from Nu-Chek Prep (Elysian, MN) and [2H4]PGA2 was purchased from Cayman Chemical Co. (Ann Arbor, MI). Dimethylformamide, undecane, pentafluorobenzyl bromide, diisopropylethylamine, methoxylamine hydrochloride, and glutathione (GSH) were from Sigma-Aldrich. Bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide was purchased from Supelco (Bellefonte, PA). Bis-[2H9]-(trimethylsilyl)acetamide was procured from CDN Isotopes (Pointe-Claire, PQ). [2H3]Methoxylamine hydrochloride was purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratory (Andover, MA), and 2,2′-azobis(2-amidinopropane) hydrochloride (AAPH) was from Polysciences, Inc. (Warrington, PA). C-18 and silica Sep-Pak cartridges were from Waters Associates (Milford, MA). 60ALK6D TLC plates were from Whatman (Maidstone, UK). Equine liver glutathione S-transferase (GST) was purchased from BioPur (Bubendorf, Switzerland). Oxidation of EPA—5 mg of fresh EPA was dissolved in 100 μl of ethanol and added immediately to 4.9 ml of phosphate-buffered saline solution (pH 7.4) containing 10 mm AAPH. The EPA oxidation reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for varying amounts of time, after which it was placed immediately at –80 °C until further processing. Purification and Analysis of A3/J3-IsoPs—Free and esterified A3/J3-IsoPs were extracted using C-18 Sep-Pak cartridges, converted to methoxylamine (MOX) derivatives in pyridine, extracted, converted to pentafluorobenzyl ester derivatives, purified by thin layer chromatography (TLC), converted to trimethylsilyl (TMS) ether derivatives, and quantified by stable isotope dilution gas chromatography (GC)/negative ion chemical ionization (NICI) mass spectrometry (MS) with [2H4]PGA2 as an internal standard using a modification of the method described for the quantification of A2/J2-IsoPs (14Chen Y. Morrow J.D. Roberts II, L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10863-10868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The only change to the procedure was the TLC purification. Instead of scraping from 1 to 3 cm above where a PGA2 methyl ester standard migrates on TLC for analysis of A2-IsoPs, the scraped area was extended to 5 cm above where PGA2 methyl ester migrates. The [M–CH2C6F5]– ions were monitored for quantification (m/z 432 for A3/J3-IsoPs and m/z 438 for [2H4]PGA2). Quantification of the total amount of A3/J3-IsoPs was determined by integrating the peak area of material in the m/z 432 channel in comparison with the m/z 438 channel. GC/NICI/MS was carried out using an Agilent Technologies 6890N Network GC/MS system. Conjugation of A3/J3-IsoPs with GSH in Vitro—A3/J3-IsoPs obtained from the in vitro oxidation of EPA were purified by Sep-Pak extraction and incubated in 0.1 m K3PO4 buffer (pH 6.5) in the presence of a 10-fold excess (∼1 μg) of GSH and 1 mg of equine liver GST containing a mixture of GSTs at 37 °C for 2 h (14Chen Y. Morrow J.D. Roberts II, L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10863-10868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The incubation mixture was then acidified to pH 3 and extracted with 2 volumes of MeCl2. Unconjugated A3/J3-IsoPs were measured in the organic fraction by GC/MS, and conjugated IsoPs represented the difference between the amount of A3/J3-IsoPs added to the incubation versus that amount present in the organic fraction (15Fam S.S. Murphey L.J. Terry E.S. Zackert W.E. Chen Y. Gao L. Pandalai S. Milne G.L. Roberts L.J. Porter N.A. Montine T.J. Morrow J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36076-36084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Subsequently, A3/J3-IsoP-GSH adducts from a separate incubation were definitively identified by LC/MS. Adducts were purified by extraction using a C18 Sep-Pak cartridge pre-conditioned with acetonitrile and 0.1 m ammonium acetate (pH 3.4) (14Chen Y. Morrow J.D. Roberts II, L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10863-10868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and eluted with 10 ml of 95% ethanol (10 ml), dried under a stream of N2, and analyzed by LC/MS. Samples were suspended in a 1:3 mixture of Phase 1/Phase 2 (Phase 1: acetonitrile/methanol/acetic acid, 95:5:0.1; Phase 2: water/Phase 1/acetic acid, 95:5:0.1). LC was carried out using the Surveyor MS Pump equipped with a Phenomenex Luna C-18 column (50 × 2.00 mm, 3 μm) using Phase 1 and Phase 2 as mobile phases (0.3 ml/min) and an isocratic gradient of Phase 1 for 1 min and then a gradient of 20–70% Phase 1 in 26 min. Samples were analyzed using a ThermoFinnigan TSQ/Quantum Ultra mass spectrometer operating in the negative ion mode. The electrospray (ESI) source was fitted with a deactivated fused silica capillary (100-mm inner diameter). Nitrogen was used as both the sheath gas and the auxiliary gas, and all parameters were tuned in order to have maximum response. For MS/MS experiments, putative A3/J3-IsoPs were collisionally activated between energies of 15 and 30 eV under 1.5 mTorr of argon. Data acquisition and analysis were performed using Xcalibur software, version 2.0. Analysis of A3/J3-IsoPs by LC/ESI-MS/MS—After extraction using the C-18 Sep-Pak methodology described above, samples were suspended in 2:1 methanol/water, and A3/J3-IsoPs were analyzed by LC. LC was performed with a Surveyor MS Pump equipped with a Phenomenex Luna C-18 column (50 × 2.00 mm, 3 μm) at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min starting with 85% Phase 1 (95:5:0.1, acetonitrile/methanol/acetic acid) to 50% from 1 to 17.50 min, holding for 30 s, and returning to 85% at 19.00 min. Phase 2 consisted of water/Phase 1/acetic acid (95:5:0.1). LC/MS was carried out on a ThermoFinnigan TSQ/Quantum Ultra mass spectrometer. The ESI source was fitted with a deactivated fused silica capillary (100-μm inner diameter), and the mass spectrometer was operated in the negative ion mode. Nitrogen was used as both the sheath gas and the auxiliary gas, at 31 and 17 p.s.i., respectively. The capillary temperature was 300 °C. The spray voltage was 5.0 kV, and the tube lens voltage was 80 V. Collision-induced dissociation (CID) of the molecular ion of putative A3/J3-IsoPs was performed from 12 to 28 eV under 1.5 mTorr of argon. Spectra that are shown were obtained at either 18 or 21 eV. Spectra were displayed by averaging scans across chromatographic peaks. Selective reaction monitoring (SRM) was performed according to characteristic fragmentation patterns of A3/J3-IsoPs determined by CID. The collision energy for SRM was 18 eV. Data acquisition and analysis were performed using Xcaliber software, version 2.0. Preparation of A3/J3-IsoPs from Rodent Tissue—Rats were fed with a rodent AIN-93 diet containing either 0 or 4% Menhaden fish oil (by weight). In some studies, animals were administered CCl4 (1 ml/kg) orogastrically to induce oxidative stress 4 h before sacrifice. After 4 weeks of feeding, the rats were sacrificed. Liver and other tissues were removed and immediately flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C. Analyzed tissue samples were homogenized in 5 ml of ice-cold chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) containing butylated hydroxytoluene (0.005%) to prevent ex vivo autoxidation. Esterified A3/J3-IsoPs in phospholipids were enzymatically hydrolyzed using bee venom PLA2 to liberate free A3/J3-IsoPs. As noted previously (18Roberts 2nd, L.J. Montine T.J. Markesbery W.R. Tapper A.R. Hardy P. Chemtob S. Dettbarn W.D. Morrow J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13605-13612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), the addition of various PUFAs including arachidonic acid, EPA, or DHA to tissues during workup does not increase the levels of IsoP-like compounds in tissue extracts. A3/J3-IsoPs in samples were then purified and analyzed as described above. Analysis of A3/J3-IsoP-PCs in Vivo by UPLC/ESI-Ion Trap-MS—Liver tissue samples were obtained from previously mentioned feeding studies, and tissue samples were homogenized in 5 ml of ice-cold chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) containing butylated hydroxytoluene (0.005%) to prevent ex vivo auto-oxidation. Phospholipids were separated from other lipids as follows. An inert II silica Sep-Pak (500 mg) was prewashed with 5 ml of hexanes followed by 5 ml of chloroform. Each sample was applied to a column and initially extracted with 12 ml of hexanes/methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) (200:3, v/v). Unoxidized cholesterol esters and triglycerides elute in this fraction. Subsequently, the column was extracted with 12 ml of methanol/MTBE (5:95, v/v) to remove non-polar lipids and cholesterol. A final extraction using 15 ml of MTBE/methanol/ammonium acetate (0.01 m) (5:8:2, v/v/v) eluted oxidized and unoxidized phospholipids. Samples were dried under N2 and reconstituted in methanol/water (2:1). Products were analyzed by UPLC/ESI-Ion Trap-MS using a Waters Acquity UPLC (Waters Corp., Milford, MA) with a Phenomenex Luna 3μ C-8 column (150 × 4.6 mm) at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min and a flow splitter, which sent ∼35% of the mobile phase to the mass spectrometer. A linear gradient was used starting with 75% solvent A (methanol/water 1:1, 20 mm ammonium acetate) to 0% in 1–10 min, held at 0% from 10- 20 min., and returned to 75% at 25 min. Mobile phase B consisted of 20 mm ammonium acetate in methanol. MS was carried out on a ThermoFinnigan LCQ Deca-XP Ion Trap mass spectrometer. The ESI source was fitted with a deactivated fused silica capillary (100-μm inner diameter), and the mass spectrometer was operated in the negative ion mode. Nitrogen was used as the sheath gas at 38 p.s.i. The capillary temperature was 350 °C. The spray voltage was 4.5 kV, and the tube lens voltage was 100 V. CID of the molecular ion of putative A3/J3-IsoPs esterified in phospholipids was performed at 25 or 35 eV under 1.5 mTorr of argon. Spectra were displayed by averaging scans across chromatographic peaks. Data acquisition and analysis were performed using Xcaliber software, version 2.0. Formation and Characterization of A3/J3-IsoPs in Vitro—EPA was oxidized using the free radical azo initiator AAPH and then analyzed for A3/J3-IsoPs. A representative SIM chromatogram obtained from the GC/MS analysis of putative A3/J3-IsoPs is shown in Fig. 2. The two large peaks shown in the lower m/z 438 ion current chromatogram represent the syn- and anti-MOX isomers of the internal standard [2H4]PGA2. The peak marked with an asterisk (*) is used for calculations of IsoP formation, while the peak marked with a plus (+) represents the other internal standard isomer. In the upper m/z 432 ion current chromatogram are a series of chromatographic peaks eluting over a 1-min interval. These compounds possess the molecular mass predicted for derivatized A3/J3-IsoPs. Furthermore, these chromatographic peaks elute at a later retention time than the deuterated PGA2 internal standard; it would be expected that A3/J3-IsoPs might elute at a different time than PGA2 because of the presence of an additional carbon-carbon double bond in the molecule (16Gao L. Yin H. Milne G.L. Porter N.A. Morrow J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14092-14099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Similar to A2/J2-IsoPs formed from arachidonic acid oxidation and A4/J4-IsoPs formed from DHA oxidation, it is not possible to differentiate between A-ring-containing molecules and J-ring-containing molecules because both chromatograph similarly and have an identical m/z ratio. It should also be noted that the retention times over which A3/J3-IsoPs elute may differ somewhat in the various figures in this report as analyses were performed on different days using different columns that varied in length. Additional experimental approaches were used to provide further evidence that the compounds represented by the chromatographic peaks in the m/z 432 channel were A3/J3-IsoPs. First, the m/z 431 ion current chromatogram contained no chromatographic peaks, indicating that the peaks in the m/z 432 channel are not natural isotope peaks of compounds generating an ion of less than m/z 432 (data not shown). Analysis of A3/J3-IsoPs as [2H3]MOX derivatives resulted in a shift of the m/z 432 chromatographic peaks up 3 Da to m/z 435, indicating the presence of one ketone (Fig. 3). As well, analysis of putative A3/J3-IsoPs as [2H9]TMS ether derivatives resulted in a shift of the m/z 432 chromatographic peaks up 9 Da to m/z 441, indicating the presence of one hydroxyl group (Fig. 4). Finally, A3/J3-IsoPs were analyzed following catalytic hydrogenation as MOX-TMS ether derivatives. Prior to hydrogenation, there were only a few chromatographic peaks present 8 Da above m/z 432 in the m/z 440 chromatogram that did not elute with putative A3/J3-IsoPs. Following hydrogenation, however, intense chromatographic peaks appeared at m/z 440 with a loss of chromatographic peaks in the m/z 432 chromatogram, indicating the presence of four double bonds (Fig. 5). Collectively these data indicate that the compounds represented by the chromatograms shown in Fig. 2 have the functional groups and the double bonds predicted for A3/J3-IsoPs.FIGURE 4Analysis of putative A3/J3-IsoPs as [2H9]TMS ether derivatives. A, analysis of compounds prior to [2H9]TMS ether derivatization. The peaks in the m/z 432 chromatogram represent the MOX-TMS ether-derivatized A3/J3-IsoPs shown in Fig. 2. As shown in the lower chromatogram, no compounds were detected 9 Da above m/z 432. B, analysis after [2H9]trimethylsilyl ether derivatization. Only a small amount of material was detected at m/z 432. A series of peaks were detected at m/z 441, which correspond to A3/J3-IsoPs after [2H9]TMS ether derivatization. The increase of 9 Da indicates the presence of one hydroxyl group in these molecules.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 5Analysis of the putative A3/J3-IsoPs generated in vitro as MOX-TMS ether derivatives prior to and after catalytic hydrogenation.

Morrow J.D. Roberts II, L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10863-10868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Thus, as a further characterization step, we sought to determine whether purified A3/J3-IsoPs obtained from the oxidation of EPA in vitro conjugate with GSH in the presence of GST. We have previously shown that cyclopentenone eicosanoids including 15-A2t-IsoP and A4/J4-NPs readily adduct GSH in the presence of GST in vitro (14Chen Y. Morrow J.D. Roberts II, L.J. J. Biol.

Formation of GSH conjugates of IsoPs was assessed first by determining the percent of A3/J3-IsoPs that did not extract into an organic solvent, methylene chloride, at pH 3. We found that 62 ± 5% of the A3/J3-IsoPs were in the form of a polar conjugate that would not extract after 2 h of incubation with GSH and GST (data not shown). These results were analogous to those found for 15-A2t-IsoP and for A4/J4-NPs (14Chen Y. Morrow J.D. Roberts II, L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10863-10868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 15Fam S.S. Murphey L.J. Terry E.S. Zackert W.E. Chen Y. Gao L. Pandalai S. Milne G.L. Roberts L.J.

These data suggest that, like other cyclopentenone IsoPs, A3/J3-IsoPs are reactive molecules capable of undergoing nucleophilic addition. Subsequently, putative A3/J3-IsoP-GSH adducts were definitively identified by LC/MS. Adducts were partially purified from an incubation mixture and subjected to LC as described above. The predicted [parent molecule–H+]– ion, hereafter referred to as “M–,” for A3/J3-IsoP-GSH adducts is m/z 638. SIM analysis showed multiple chromatographic peaks with this m/z eluting from 10.5 to 11.5 min, presumably representing GSH adducts of different A3/J3-IsoP stereoisomers. CID experiments confirmed"

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6569-6581Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) and has been previously linked to DNA repair through a direct physical interaction between Cdc5L and WRN, the protein deficient in Werner syndrome (18Zhang N.

Human Pso4 contains six successive WD-40 motifs at the C terminus that is known to form a structural interface for the assembly of multiprotein complexes (19Gotzmann J. Gerner C. Meissner M. Holzmann K. Grimm R. Mikulits W. Sauermann G. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 261: 166-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and has been identified as a component of the nuclear matrix (20Gerner C.

Pso4 is also a U-box protein with associated E3 ubiquitin ligase activity crucial for its function in pre-mRNA splicing in vivo (21Ohi M.D. Vander Kooi C.W. Rosenberg J.A. Chazin W.J. Gould K.L. Nat.

Human Pso4 interacts with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), a protein that adds nucleotides to DNA ends generated during V(D)J recombination that are subsequently processed by proteins involved in general DSB repair pathways (16Mahajan K.N.

Purified hPso4 binds double-stranded DNA in a sequence-independent manner but does not bind single-stranded DNA. Human Pso4 protein is induced in cells by γ-radiation and interstrand cross-linkers, but not by UV treatment (16Mahajan K.N. Mitchell B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10746-10751Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). A targeted inhibition of hPso4 expression results in accumulation of DNA DSBs and decreased cell survival after DNA damage (16Mahajan K.N. Mitchell B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10746-10751Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), suggesting that hPso4 plays a unique role in mammalian DNA DSB repair. Nonetheless, the specific role(s) for Pso4 in DSB repair is not known. In this study, we show that hPso4 is a Metnase (SETMAR)-binding partner that forms a stable complex with Metnase on both TIR and non-TIR DNA. Human Pso4 is induced and co-localized with Metnase following ionizing radiation (IR) treatment. Cells treated with hPso4-siRNA failed to show Metnase localization at DSB sites and Metnase-mediated stimulation of DNA end joining, suggesting that hPso4 forms a stable complex with Metnase and mediates Metnase association at DNA damage sites in vivo. Cells, Enzymes, and Chemicals—Human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), penicillin (10 unit/ml; Sigma), and streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml; Sigma). [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences and Analytical Science (Boston, MA), and Bradford reagents and protein molecular weight markers were purchased from Bio-Rad. An anti-Metnase polyclonal antibody was previously described (1Lee S.H. Oshige M. Durant S.T. Rasila K.K. Williamson E.A. Ramsey H. Kwan L. Nickoloff J.A. Hromas R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 18075-18080Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and an anti-Pso4 polyclonal antibody specific for human Pso4 was obtained from the Calbiochem (Darmstadt, Germany) (16Mahajan K.N. Mitchell B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10746-10751Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Anti-FLAG M2 and V5 monoclonal antibodies were from Sigma and Invitrogen, respectively. Generation of Stable Cell Lines and preparation of Cell Extracts and Immunoblot Analysis—Cells stably overexpressing wt-Metnase or wt-hPso4 were generated by transfecting HEK 293 cells with a vector harboring FLAG-Metnase, V5-Metnase, or FLAG-hPso4 using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science), followed by selection with G418 (Invitrogen) for 14 days, after which a single colony was isolated and amplified. For preparation of cell extracts, the cells were briefly washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in a buffer containing 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.3 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 20 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitor cocktails (Sigma). Cell lysates (50 μg) were loaded onto a SDS-PAGE, and following gel electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA) and immunoblotted with primary antibody followed by peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences) and an enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) reaction prior to visualization on Kodak X-Omat film. DNA Substrates—DNA substrates were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). The 32-mer dsDNA containing either the 19-mer core sequence necessary for Metnase binding (TIR32) or a 5-nucleotide mutation at the core (MAR3M) was previously described. For Metnase-induced DNA looping experiment, 118-mer dsDNA containing either two TIR32 sequences in the forward direction separated by 54 bp of random nucleotides (Fwd-Fwd template: 5′-AGG TTG GTG CAA AAG TAA TTG CGG AGC TGG CTA TCG GAA CTC TCG GAA GTT GGG TCA GTT ACA ACG CGC CAC CCG CGC CCC GTA CTG ATA GCA GGG TGC AAA AGT AAT TGC GGA GGT T-3′) or a forward TIR32 sequence and a reverse TIR32 sequence separated by the same 54-bp nucleotides (Fwd-Rev template: 5′-AGG TTG GTG CAA AAG TAA TTG CGG AGC TGG CTA TCG GAA CTC TCG GAA GTT GGG TCA GTT ACA ACG CGC CAC CCG CGC CCC GTA CTG ATA GCA GGG CGT TAA TGA AAA CGT GGA GGT T-3′) were annealed. Identification of Metnase-associated Proteins—Proteins associated with Metnase were identified by immunoprecipitation with an anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) and protein G-agarose beads (Upstate, Temecula, CA). Whole cell extracts of 293 cells overexpressing FLAG-Metnase were incubated with 3 μg of antibody at 4 °C for 2 h, followed by the addition of 100 μl of protein G-agarose beads overnight. The complex was washed four times with 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 250 mm NaCl prior to running on a 10% SDS-PAGE. After staining the gel with Coomassie Blue, individual bands were excised and immersed in 100 μl of 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate and 50% acetonitrile (by volume) to completely cover the gel pieces (25Chen J.Y. Shen C. Yan Z. Brown D.P. Wang M. Comput. Syst. Bioinformatics Conf. 2006; : 389-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, the gel pieces were dehydrated with 100 μl of acetonitrile for 5 min and rehydrated with 100 μl of 10 mm dithiothreitol at 55 °C for 45 min for reduction. Following alkylation with 100 μl of 55 mm iodoacetamide for 30 min at 37 °C, the gel pieces were briefly dehydrated with 100 μl of acetonitrile and treated with a trypsin solution (Promega V5280, 0.1-0.5 μg) overnight at 37 °C. Following trypsin digestion, the peptides were extracted with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and injected onto a 75-μm × 5-cm C-18 reverse-phase column. The peptides were eluted with a gradient from 5 to 45% acetonitrile over 30 min using an Agilent 1100 series nanopump. The column was interfaced with a LTQ ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo), and the data were collected in the data-dependent neutral loss MS3 mode. Tandem mass spectrometry spectra were searched against the IPI human protein data base with SEQUEST algorithm. Purification of FLAG-Metnase and FLAG-hPso4—Metnase (or hPso4)-expressing cells (1.6 × 108) were suspended in 20 ml of extraction buffer (TEGDN; 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1.0% Nonidet-P40, and mammalian protease inhibitor cocktails containing 0.2 m NaCl) and centrifuged (100,000 × g) for 30 min. The supernatant (S100 fraction) was filtered through a Whatman paper and used for immunoaffinity purification. The S100 fraction was incubated at 4 °C for 60 min with anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) that had been pre-equilibrated with TEGDN buffer containing 0.2 m NaCl. The beads were washed three times with TEGDN, 2.0 m NaCl buffer prior to elution of the protein with TEGDN, 0.2 m NaCl containing FLAG peptide (500 μg/ml). The eluant was diluted with 10 volumes of TEGDN buffer and loaded onto a heparin-Sepharose 6 Fast Flow column (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with TEGDN buffer. After washing the column, Metnase (or hPso4) was fractionated using a linear gradient (0-2.0 m NaCl) of TEGDN buffer. The eluted protein was dialyzed against TEGDN buffer containing 50 mm NaCl and stored at -80 °C. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay of Protein-DNA Interaction—Duplex DNA was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The indicated amount of purified Metnase and/or hPso4 was incubated with 200 fmol of 5′-32P-labeled DNA at room temperature for 15 min in a reaction mixture containing 50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.8), bovine serum albumin (0.2 μg/μl), and 50 mm NaCl. The Metnase-DNA complex was analyzed on either 5% polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide:bis-acrylamide 43.2:0.8) in 0.5× TBE or 1% vertical agarose gel in 1× TBE. The gels were dried and exposed to x-ray films (Kodak). For quantification, the bands of interest were excised from the gels and measured for radioactivity using a Beckman Scintillation Counter LS 6500. Transfection of Cells with siRNA—A control scrambled siRNA and Metnase-specific siRNA were obtained from Dharmacon Research Co. (Lafayette, CO). Human 293 cells (2.0 × 104) were plated on 6-well plates and incubated for 24 h prior to transfection. The cells were washed once with fresh medium, and siRNA (0.2-0.4 μm) was diluted in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 to a final volume of 200 μl. The diluted siRNA samples were combined with transfection agent (Oligofectamine) and incubated for 20 min at room temperature before adding to cells. After incubation for 4 h, 0.5 ml of culture medium containing 30% serum was added without removing the transfection mixture, and the cells were further incubated for 48-72 h. The cell lysates were prepared and examined for efficacy of siRNA by Western blot analysis. Laser Scanning Confocal Microscopy—The cells were grown up to 70% confluence on a sterilized Labtek II coverslip, irradiated with Gammacell-40 exactor (Nordion) as a 137Cs source, and further incubated at 37 °C until harvest. Immunofluorescence microscopy was carried out as described previously (26Park S.J. Ciccone S.L. Freie B. Kurimasa A. Chen D.J. Li G.C. Clapp D.W. Lee S.H. J. Biol.

DNA End Joining Coupled to Genomic Integration Analysis— Chromosomal integration was analyzed by the ability of cells to pass foreign nonhomologous DNA containing a selectable marker to progeny. pRNA/U6.Hygro plasmid was transfected into 293 cells stably expressing mock (pFLAG2 vector), pFLAG2-wt-Metnase, or pFLAG2-D483A using calcium phosphate transfection method as previously described (1Lee S.H. Oshige M. Durant S.T. Rasila K.K. Williamson E.A. Ramsey H. Kwan L. Nickoloff J.A. Hromas R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 18075-18080Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Forty-eight hours after transfection, varying numbers of cells were plated into 100-mm dishes, and 24 h later selective marker (hygromycin, 0.15 mg/ml) was added. The cells were incubated for 14 days in the presence of hygromycin, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and stained with 0.17% methylene blue in methanol, and colonies defined as greater than 50 cells were counted. All of the experiments were performed in triplicate. HPso4 Is a Metnase-binding Partner—Although Metnase (SETMAR) preserves most transposase activities including TIR-specific DNA binding, assembly of a paired end complex, and DNA cleavage (6Cordaux R.

Overexpression of Metnase increases both NHEJ and cell survival following IR treatment (1Lee S.H. Oshige M. Durant S.T. Rasila K.K. Williamson E.A. Ramsey H. Kwan L. Nickoloff J.A. Hromas R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 18075-18080Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), suggesting that it plays a positive role in DSB repair, although its function in repair is not known. In an effort to find Metnase-binding partner(s), cell extracts from human 293 cells stably expressing FLAG-Metnase were used to pull down Metnase and its associated protein(s) using a FLAG monoclonal antibody. A SDS-PAGE analysis identified three proteins co-immunoprecipitated with Metnase (Fig. 1A). Based on a proteomic analysis, the 55-kDa protein was identified as the human homolog of the PRP19 gene product of S. cerevisiae (PRP19/Pso4, NCBI accession number NP_055317) involved in pre-mRNA splicing and DNA repair (16Mahajan K.N.

Interestingly, the 37-kDa was identified as the human homolog of Spf27 (NP_060544), a member of the Prp19 core complex involved in pre-mRNA splicing (18Zhang N. Kaur R. Lu X. Shen X. Li L. Legerski R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40559-40567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 28Lu X. Legerski R.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 354: 968-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Because both Metnase and hPso4 are involved in DSB repair (1Lee S.H. Oshige M. Durant S.T. Rasila K.K. Williamson E.A. Ramsey H. Kwan L. Nickoloff J.A. Hromas R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 18075-18080Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 16Mahajan K.N. Mitchell B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10746-10751Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), we examined whether Metnase directly interacts with hPso4. For this, hPso4 cDNA was put into pFLAG-CMV4 vector to generate a stable cell overexpressing FLAG-hPso4. Human 293 cells stably expressing FLAG-Pso4 or V5-Metnase were transfected with pcDNA3-V5-Metnase or pFLAG-Pso4, respectively (Fig. 1B). Reciprocal protein pulldown experiments confirmed that Metnase directly interacted with hPso4 (Fig. 1C). Metnase Associates with Non-TIR DNA in the Presence of hPso4—Human Pso4 is not only a Metnase-binding partner but also a dsDNA-binding protein that plays a major but undefined role in mammalian DNA repair (16Mahajan K.N. Mitchell B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10746-10751Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether the Metnase-DNA interaction is influenced by hPso4. Using affinity-purified proteins (Fig. 2A), we first examined DNA binding activity of Metnase and hPso4. Unlike the TIR-specific DNA binding activity of Metnase (6Cordaux R. Udit S. Batzer M.A. Feschotte C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 8101-8106Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 14Liu D. Bischerour J. Siddique A. Buisine N. Bigot Y. Chalmers R. Mol.

Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 11369-11376Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2C), hPso4 showed dsDNA binding activity with both TIR and non-TIR DNA (Fig. 2, C and D) (16Mahajan K.N. Mitchell B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10746-10751Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). On the basis of a titration experiment, we calculated an approximate KD value of 9.0 × 10-8 m for the hPso4-dsDNA interaction (Fig. 2D). In a reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation experiment, Metnase was able to associate with non-TIR DNA (MAR3M) in the presence of hPso4, but it alone did not (Fig. 3A). To see whether Metnase association with non-TIR DNA represents the Metnase-hPso4-DNA complex, we used biotin-labeled duplex DNA bound to streptavidin beads for a pulldown of the protein(s)-DNA complex. In keeping with the co-immunoprecipitation experiment (Fig. 3A), Metnase interacted with non-TIR DNA in the presence of hPso4, whereas Metnase alone failed to associate with non-TIR DNA (Fig. 3B), suggesting that Metnase associates with non-TIR DNA via interaction with hPso4.FIGURE 3Metnase associates with non-TIR DNA in the presence of hPso4. A, V5-wt-Metnase and/or FLAG-wt-hPso4 were immunoprecipitated with cell extracts (100 μg) overexpressing V5-Metnase (lanes 3, 6, 9, and 12), FLAG-Pso4 (lanes 5, 8, 11, and 14), or both (lanes 4, 7, 10, 13) using either anti-V5 (lanes 3-5 and 9-11) or -FLAG (lanes 6-8 and 12-14) monoclonal antibody. Following immunoprecipitation, either 5′-32P-labeled TIR32 (lanes 3-8) or 32P-MAR3M (lanes 9-14) was added to the mixtures for interaction of Metnase/hPso4 with 32P-labeled DNA. Following 10% SDS-PAGE, gel was dried and exposed to x-ray film. In control lanes (lanes 1 and 2), purified FLAG-Metnase (100 ng) was incubated with either TIR32 or MAR3M prior to immunoprecipitation using an anti-FLAG antibody. B, purified FLAG-wt-Metnase and/or FLAG-wt-hPso4 were incubated for 15 min prior to addition of either biotin-labeled TIR (lanes 3-6) or MAR3M (lanes 7-10). Following the addition of Streptavidin-agarose beads, the protein-DNA complexes were precipitated, washed, and analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE. Western blotting was done using an anti-FLAG antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Metnase Forms a Stable Complex with hPso4 on Both TIR and Non-TIR DNA—To further understand how hPso4-Metnase interaction influences Metnase DNA binding activity, we examined the interaction of Metnase with hPso4 on DNA using a gel mobility shift assay. Metnase showed TIR-specific DNA binding activity, whereas hPso4 formed a stable complex with both TIR and non-TIR DNA (Fig. 4A). A slower migrating band was observed when Metnase and hPso4 was incubated together in the presence of TIR or non-TIR DNA (Fig. 4A, lanes 3 and 7), suggesting that Metnase forms a stable complex with hPso4 on DNA. To confirm that the slower migrating band truly represents the Metnase-hPso4 complex on DNA, we carried out a supershift assay where the complex of V5-Metnase and/or FLAG-hPso4 with 32P-labled DNA was identified by a supershift in the presence of either V5 or FLAG antibody. A more slowly migrating band observed with V5-Metnase, FLAG-hPso4, and DNA (TIR32 or MAR3M) was supershifted in the presence of either V5 or FLAG antibody (Fig. 4B, lanes 9, 10, 13, and 14), which verifies a stable complex of Metnase and hPso4 on both TIR and non-TIR DNA. We next examined how Metnase and hPso4 influence their binding to TIR and non-TIR DNA. In a gel mobility shift assay, the Metnase-hPso4-DNA complex was proportionally increased with increasing amounts of hPso4 (Fig. 5A) or Metnase (Fig. 5B) in the presence of either TIR or non-TIR (MAR3M) DNA, confirming that hPso4 mediates the Metnase-non-TIR DNA interaction via physical interaction. The result also suggests that Metnase and hPso4 form a single complex that appears to have one hPso4 tetramer (23Vander Kooi C.W. Ohi M.D. Rosenberg J.A. Oldham M."

It has recently been shown that the culture supernatant of Escherichia coli induces the expression of S100A7c (psoriasin) in KCs and that S100A7c efficiently kills E. coli. Here we have investigated which of the microbial components triggers the up-regulation of S100A7c expression. Exposure of human primary KCs to ligands of the human Toll-like receptors (TLRs) revealed that only the TLR5 ligand flagellin strongly induced the expression of S100A7c mRNA and protein, whereas all other TLR ligands had no significant effect. In contrast to the supernatant from flagellated wild-type (WT) E. coli, the supernatant of a flagellin-deficient E. coli strain (DeltaFliC) did not induce S100A7c expression. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of TLR5 expression suppressed the ability of KCs to up-regulate S100A7c expression in response to both flagellin and WT E. coli supernatant. Taken together, our data demonstrate that bacterial flagellin is essential and sufficient for the induction of S100A7c expression in KCs by E. coli."

We have characterized the kinetic mechanism of recombinant His-tagged PRMT6 using a mass spectrometry method for monitoring the methylation of a series of peptides bearing a single arginine, MMA, or aDMA residue. We find that PRMT6 follows an ordered sequential mechanism in which S-adenosyl-l-methionine binds to the enzyme first and the methylated product is the first to dissociate. Furthermore, we find that the enzyme displays a preference for the monomethylated peptide substrate, exhibiting both lower Km and higher Vmax values than what are observed for the unmethylated peptide. This difference in substrate Km and Vmax, as well as the lack of detectable aDMA-containing product from the unmethylated substrate, suggest a distributive rather than processive mechanism for multiple methylations of a single arginine residue. In addition, we speculate that the increased catalytic efficiency of PRMT6 for methylated substrates combined with lower Km values for native protein methyl acceptors may obscure this distributive mechanism to produce an apparently processive mechanism.

Most recently several groups have demonstrated that PRMT6 methylation of Arg-2 on histone H3 in vivo exists in an exclusive relationship with Lys-4 methylation, thus adding to the mounting evidence that PRMT6 is a negative regulator of cellular as well as viral transcriptional activation (31Guccione E.

Lett. 2007; 17: 4150-4153Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar).Despite efforts to understand various PRMT activities within a cellular context, very little is known about the mechanism of sequential methyl transfer for this family of enzymes. PRMTs are part of a larger family of AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases that use a Bi-Bi enzyme mechanism to produce two products from two reactants (38Cheng X. S-Adenosylmethionine-dependent Methyltransferases: Structures and Functions. World Scientific Publishing Company, River Edge2000Google Scholar, 39Tamanoi F. Clarke S. The Enzymes: Protein Methyltransferases. Academic Press, San Diego2006Google Scholar). This mechanism is complicated with respect to PRMTs, because the product of a single methylation (MMA) can be the substrate for a second reaction to form the final dimethylated product. Another layer of mechanistic complexity arises when a protein substrate contains multiple arginine residues such as GAR- or arginine-rich motif-containing sequences, thereby increasing the combinations of potential products. Early enzyme preparations of PRMT were purified from animal tissue and often catalyzed the formation of MMA, aDMA, and sDMA residues, indicating contamination with multiple PRMTs. One such study on “protein methylase I” isolated from calf brain exhibited a sequential ordered Bi-Bi reaction mechanism in which AdoMet was determined to bind prior to the protein substrate (40Lee H.W. Kim S. Paik W.K. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 78-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Recent structural evidence from different PRMT·AdoHcy complexes supports the sequential ordered Bi-Bi reaction mechanism (13Yue W.W. Hassler M. Roe S.M. Thompson-Vale V. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 4402-4412Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 14Zhang X. Cheng X. Structure. 2003; 11: 509-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 15Zhang X. Zhou L. Cheng X. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3509-3519Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). All of these structures show a disordered N-terminal helix that resolves upon AdoHcy binding, suggesting a mechanism similar to a trap door that locks AdoMet into place. This helix forms a ridge along which the arginine-containing substrate can bind, implying that AdoMet must bind first to form the binding site for the methyl acceptor (13Yue W.W. Hassler M. Roe S.M. Thompson-Vale V. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 4402-4412Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 14Zhang X. Cheng X.

Interestingly, PRMT dimerization is a requirement to stabilize the enzyme-AdoMet complex, and it places two active sites in close proximity to one another that may contribute to the production of aDMA residues in a processive manner (12Weiss V.H. McBride A.E. Soriano M.A. Filman D.J. Silver P.A. Hogle J.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1165-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 13Yue W.W. Hassler M. Roe S.M. Thompson-Vale V.

Therefore, a model for PRMT activity may involve both monomers loaded with AdoMet and each responsible for one of two methyl transfers. Perhaps this model explains the observation that endogenous PRMT substrates almost exclusively contain aDMA residues (41Boisvert F.M. Cote J. Boulanger M.C. Richard S. Mol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 16935-16945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar)) revealed that formation of aDMA residues over time closely follows formation of MMA residues, suggesting a processive mechanism for multiple methyl transfers (6Frankel A. Yadav N. Lee J. Branscombe T.L. Clarke S. Bedford M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3537-3543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Indeed, apparent processitivity in GST-PRMT1 and GST-PRMT3 methylations of a GAR-like peptide substrate containing four arginine residues has also been observed (48Pahlich S. Bschir K. Chiavi C. Belyanskaya L. Gehring H. Proteins. 2005; 61: 164-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). It has also been speculated that PRMT1 methylates with a partially processive mechanism whereby aDMA production does not occur in an obligate fashion relative to MMA formation, yet it still accumulates in significant amounts (49Osborne T.C. Obianyo O. Zhang X. Cheng X. Thompson P.R. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 13370-13381Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar).In the present study we elucidate the kinetic mechanism of His-tagged PRMT6 (H6PRMT6) using a series of “minimal” peptide substrates bearing either a single arginine residue (R1), an MMA residue (R1(MMA)), or an aDMA residue (R1(aDMA)). Using the R1 and R1(MMA) peptides we describe the kinetic mechanism of single and multiple methylation events by PRMT6 on one arginine residue. A UPLC mass spectrometry (MS) method for directly measuring the rate of methylation is described. We find that PRMT6 follows an ordered sequential mechanism in which AdoMet binds to the enzyme first, and the methylated product is the first product to dissociate. Furthermore, we find that the enzyme displays a preference for the methylated peptide substrate, exhibiting both lower Km and higher Vmax values than those observed for the unmethylated peptide. This difference in substrate Km and Vmax along with the lack of detectable aDMA-containing product from the R1 peptide substrate suggests a distributive rather than processive mechanism for multiple methylations of a single arginine residue.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPRMT6 Enzyme—The construct for His-tagged PRMT6 (H6PRMT6) was generated by subcloning the gene from the pGEX-6P-1 vector (a gift from Dr. Steven Clarke at UCLA) into the pET28a+ vector using the restriction enzymes BamHI and XhoI. H6PRMT6 was induced in BL21 Star (DE3) with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h, and the cells were harvested by centrifugation. Cells were lysed by sonication and purified by a 1-ml His-Trap affinity column (GE Healthcare) according to established methods (50Shimizu Y. Inoue A. Tomari Y. Suzuki T. Yokogawa T. Nishikawa K.

The partially purified H6PRMT6 was desalted using a HiPrep 26/10 desalting column (Amersham Biosciences) and applied to a SynChropak S300 strong cation exchange semi-prep high-performance liquid chromatography column. The column was washed with 20 ml of 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.5, and H6PRMT6 was eluted with 80 ml of a linear 0 to 100% gradient of 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.5, with 1 m NaCl over 20 min. Fractions containing H6PRMT6 were desalted as above and applied to a 5-ml HiTrap Q HP (GE Healthcare) column. The column was washed with 30 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and pure H6PRMT6 was eluted with 90 ml of a linear 0 to 100% gradient of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, with 1 m NaCl over 30 min. Pure H6PRMT6 was concentrated with an Ultra 15 10k NMWCO centrifugal filter (Amicon) and resuspended in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl, 30% glycerol, and 7 mm mercaptoethanol for storage at -80 °C (50Shimizu Y. Inoue A. Tomari Y. Suzuki T. Yokogawa T. Nishikawa K. Ueda T. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 751-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar).To determine the purification of H6PRMT6 away from contaminating proteins that can act as potential substrates we performed methylation reactions after each purification step. Samples were incubated with methylation buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, with 10 mm NaCl and 1 mm dithiothreitol) and 112.5 μm (9.25 kBq) S-adenosyl-l-[methyl-14C]methionine ([14C]AdoMet) at 37 °C for 90 min. Following incubation, the reactions were precipitated with 12% trichloroacetic acid, dried, and mixed with 2× SDS-PAGE sample dilution buffer and applied to a 10% SDS-PAGE gel prepared according to established methods (51Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206057) Google Scholar) using a mini-Protein 3 electrophoresis apparatus (Bio-Rad). The dried gel was exposed to a storage phosphor screen (Amersham Biosciences) for 72 h. The concentration of H6PRMT6 was determined by total acid hydrolysis, and amino acid analysis was performed at the Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada, and confirmed by UV spectrometry using the calculated extinction coefficient of ϵ280 nm = 59275 m-1 cm-1 (52Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5023) Google Scholar).Peptide Substrates—Peptide substrates R1, R1(MMA), R1(aDMA), and R1(sDMA) shown in Fig. 1 were synthesized by Sigma Genosys. The concentrations of the peptides were determined by total acid hydrolysis, and amino acid analysis as above. Peptide concentrations were confirmed with UV spectrometry using the calculated extinction coefficient of ϵ280 nm = 13980 m-1 cm-1 (52Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5023) Google Scholar).Mass Spectrometer Assay—The activity of H6PRMT6 was measured using a UPLC mass spectrometer (UPLC-MS) assay. A Waters Acquity UPLC BEH C18 column (2.1 × 100 mm) was used at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min at 40 °C. The mobile phases 0.1% aqueous formic acid (A) and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile (B) were used in a step gradient of 99% A for 2.3 min and 85% A for 2.4 to 11.5 min. A Quatro Premier XE electrospray mass spectrometer (Micromass MS Technologies) was operated in positive ion mode with a cone voltage of 20 V selected ion recording for ions with m/z 385, 651.9, 658.9, and 665.9 corresponding to AdoHcy+1 R1+2, R1(MMA)+2, and R1(aDMA)+2, respectively. The standards AdoHcy, R1(MMA), and R1(aDMA) were used at concentrations of 0.06 to 3 μm, and all standards were separated by at least 0.5 min (supplemental Fig. S1).Unless stated otherwise enzyme assays were performed with 0.035 μg/μlH6PRMT6 (0.77 μm final concentration) in the methylation buffer (described above) in a total assay volume of 40 μl at 37 °C for 90 min. All reactions were stopped by incubating the samples at 80 °C for 3 min followed by flash freezing in liquid nitrogen. To establish a linear range of enzyme activity, 50 μm R1 or R1(MMA) substrates were incubated with 200 μm AdoMet at 37 °C for 0-300 min. To determine the type of bi-substrate reaction (ping-pong or sequential) we performed enzyme reactions with 25, 50, 75, 150, and 300 μm R1 peptide or 25, 50, 75, 100, and 150 μm R1(MMA) peptide with constant AdoMet concentrations of 5, 10, 25, and 150 μm. Assays with the product inhibitor AdoHcy at concentrations of 2, 5, and 15 μm were performed with constant (100 μm) or variable (25, 50, 75, and 100 μm) R1(MMA) and constant (20 μm) or variable (10, 20, 30, and 50 μm) AdoMet. Complementary assays with the product inhibitor R1(aDMA) at concentrations of 20, 50, 100, and 300 μm were performed with constant (50 μm) or variable (25, 50, 75, and 100 μm) R1(MMA) and constant (20 μm) or variable (10, 20, 30, and 50 μm) AdoMet. For the R1 peptide substrate, assays with the product inhibitor AdoHcy at concentrations of 2, 5, and 15 μm were performed with constant (75 μm) or variable (50, 100, 150, and 200 μm) R1 and constant (20 μm) or variable (10, 20, 30, and 50 μm) AdoMet. Complementary assays with the product inhibitor R1(aDMA) at concentrations of 50, 100, and 300 μm were also performed with the same constant or variable concentrations of R1 and AdoMet as above. For the assays in which AdoHcy was the product inhibitor the reaction was monitored for ions with m/z = 658.9 (R1(MMA)+2) or 665.9 (R1(aDMA)+2) for the substrates R1 and R1(MMA), respectively. Where R1(aDMA) was used as the product inhibitor the reaction was monitored by measuring the accumulation of the ion m/z = 385 corresponding to AdoHcy+1.TLC Assay—The activity of H6PRMT6 was also measured by a TLC assay. Methylation reactions to establish a linear range for enzyme activity were repeated as above with 50 μm R1 or R1(MMA) substrate except that the final reaction volume was 20 μl, and 100 μm [14C]AdoMet (4.1 kBq per 20-μl reaction) was used. The reactions were stopped at times 0-300 min by the addition of 10 μl of a 70% suspension of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid nickel affinity agarose (Qiagen) with 2 μl of 2.5 mm AdoHcy, and incubated for 10 min at ambient temperature. This reaction was centrifuged and the resulting 20-μl supernatant was added to Pyrex hydrolysis tubes, followed by the addition of 100 μl of acetone. The acetone/supernatant mixture was dried in a vacuum centrifuge and then hydrolyzed in vacuo with 6 m HCl at 110 °C for 24 h. The hydrolyzed material for each reaction was resuspended in 10 μl of water of which 1 μl was spotted onto glass-backed 5 × 20-cm silica TLC plates. Unlabeled arginine, MMA, aDMA, and sDMA (250 pmol each) were also spotted onto the plate as reference standards. No-enzyme controls were prepared as above except with 500 μm R1(MMA) and 180 μm [14C]AdoMet (3.6 kBq per 10-μl reaction). The plates were developed in 75% ethanol and 25% concentrated NH4OH, and the dried plate was exposed to a storage phosphor screen along with 0.04-9 pmol spots of [14C]AdoMet as radioactive standards. The unlabeled standards were visualized using ninhydrin according to established methods (53Stewart J. Young J. Stewart J. Young J. 2nd. Ed. Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis. Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL1984: 53-122Google Scholar).Data Analysis—The data for the bi-substrate reaction was initially fit via non-linear least squares using SigmaPlot 8 (SYSTAT) to the Michaelis-Menten equation for a Uni-Uni reaction for eac"
https://openalex.org/W1997794863,"Live-cell detection of intracellular enzyme activity requires that substrates are cell-permeable and that the generated products are easily detected and retained in cells. Our objective was to create a novel fluorogenic substrate that could be used for real-time detection of apoptosis in living cells. We have synthesized a highly cell-permeable caspase-3 substrate, DEVD-NucView488, by linking a fluorogenic DNA-binding dye to the caspase-3 recognition sequence that renders the dye nonfunctional. On substrate cleavage, the dye is released and becomes highly fluorescent on binding to DNA. DEVD-NucView488 detected caspase-3 activation within a live-cell population much earlier and with higher sensitivity compared with other apoptosis reagents that are currently available. Furthermore, cells incubated with DEVD-NucView488 exhibited no toxicity and normal apoptotic progression. DEVD-NucView488 is an ideal substrate for kinetic studies of caspase-3 activation because it detects caspase-3 activity in real-time and also efficiently labels DNA in nuclei of caspase-3-activated cells for real-time fluorescent visualization of apoptotic morphology. The strategy utilized in the design of this fluorogenic substrate can be applied in future endeavors to develop substrates for detecting real-time intracellular enzyme activity."

Activation of PPARγ by TZDs improves insulin sensitivity; however, this is accompanied by the induction of several undesirable side effects. We have identified a novel synthetic PPARγ ligand, T2384, to explore the biological activities associated with occupying different regions of the receptor ligand-binding pocket. X-ray crystallography studies revealed that T2384 can adopt two distinct binding modes, which we have termed “U” and “S”, interacting with the ligand-binding pocket of PPARγ primarily via hydrophobic contacts that are distinct from full agonists. The different binding modes occupied by T2384 induced distinct patterns of coregulatory protein interaction with PPARγ in vitro and displayed unique receptor function in cell-based activity assays. We speculate that these unique biochemical and cellular activities may be responsible for the novel in vivo profile observed in animals treated systemically with T2384. When administered to diabetic KKAy mice, T2384 rapidly improved insulin sensitivity in the absence of weight gain, hemodilution, and anemia characteristics of treatment with rosiglitazone (a TZD). Moreover, upon coadministration with rosiglitazone, T2384 was able to antagonize the side effects induced by rosiglitazone treatment alone while retaining robust effects on glucose disposal. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that interactions between ligands and specific regions of the receptor ligand-binding pocket might selectively trigger a subset of receptor-mediated biological responses leading to the improvement of insulin sensitivity, without eliciting less desirable responses associated with full activation of the receptor.

PPARγ, together with PPARα (NR1C1) and PPARδ (NR1C2), form a subfamily of “lipid sensing” receptors that regulate important aspects of lipid and glucose homeostasis (3Evans R.M. Barish G.D. Wang Y.X. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar, 4Semple R.K. Chatterjee V.K. O'Rahilly S. J. Clin. Investig. 2006; 116: 581-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). At least two PPARγ isoforms exist, γ1 and γ2, resulting from transcription from two different promoters upstream of the PPARG gene (5Fajas L. Auboeuf D. Raspe E. Schoonjans K. Lefebvre A.M. Saladin R. Najib J. Laville M. Fruchart J.C. Deeb S. Vidal-Puig A. Flier J. Briggs M.R. Staels B. Vidal H. Auwerx J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18779-18789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar). PPARγ1 is expressed broadly in many tissues, whereas PPARγ2, which possesses an additional 30 amino acids at its N terminus, is expressed predominantly in adipose tissue. Both “gain of function” and “loss of function” studies have firmly established PPARγ as a master regulator of adipocyte differentiation and a link with the diseased state in type 2 diabetes (3Evans R.M. Barish G.D. Wang Y.X. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar). The important roles PPARγ plays in lipid metabolism, inflammatory cytokine production, and macrophage function may also have direct impacts on dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, and cardiovascular diseases (6Ricote M. Valledor A.F. Glass C.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 230-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar).The first insight into the link between PPARγ and diabetes came from the discovery of PPARγ as the biologic target for the thiazolidinedione class of antidiabetic drugs (TZDs) (7Forman B.M. Tontonoz P. Chen J. Brun R.P. Spiegelman B.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 803-812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2713) Google Scholar, 8Lehmann J.M. Moore L.B. Smith-Oliver T.A. Wilkison W.O. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12953-12956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3443) Google Scholar). Two such drugs, rosiglitazone (Avandia™; GlaxoSmithKline) and pioglitazone (Actos™; Takeda Pharmaceuticals), have been prescribed either as monotherapy or in combination with sulfonylureas, metformin, or insulin to achieve glycemic control in diabetic patients. Interestingly, although TZDs lower glucose and improve lipid and adipocytokine profiles in type 2 diabetics, as full agonists they also stimulate adipocyte differentiation in vitro and result in weight gain in vivo, which normally aggravates the diabetic state. Additional undesirable side effects associated with TZD treatment include edema/hemodilution, cardiomegaly, and anemia (9Nesto R.W. Bell D. Bonow R.O. Fonseca V. Grundy S.M. Horton E.S. Le Winter M. Porte D. Semenkovich C.F. Smith S. Young L.H. Kahn R. Diabetes Care. 2004; 27: 256-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). These side effects most likely result directly from activation of the receptor, because other PPARγ agonists with unrelated chemical structures show similar profiles (10Picard F. Auwerx J. Annu. Rev. Nutrition. 2002; 22: 167-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar).Paradoxically, the reduction of PPARγ activity also results in improvement in insulin sensitivity. Human genetic studies have identified genetic variants in PPARγ associated with altered risks to development of type 2 diabetes. For example, one common polymorphism, Pro12Ala, correlates both with a reduction in the risk of type 2 diabetes and with a reduction in body mass index (11Knouff C. Auwerx J. Endocr. Rev. 2004; 25: 899-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 12Florez J.C. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2004; 89: 4234-4237Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The in vitro characterization of this polymorphism suggests that the Ala allele causes a partial loss of PPARγ function as a result of decreased DNA binding affinity and transcription activity (13Deeb S.S. Fajas L. Nemoto M. Pihlajamaki J. Mykkanen L. Kuusisto J. Laakso M. Fujimoto W. Auwerx J. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 284-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (1190) Google Scholar, 14Masugi J. Tamori Y. Mori H. Koike T. Kasuga M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 178-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In rodents, the reduction of PPARγ expression in PPARγ+/- heterozygotes protects these animals from high fat diet- or aging-induced adipocyte hypertrophy, obesity, and insulin resistance. The heterozygous animals also show reduction in factors associated with insulin resistance, including free fatty acids and tumor necrosis factor α, an up-regulation of leptin and adiponectin, and a significantly increased rate of fatty acid β-oxidation. This latter finding may explain the decrease in triglyceride content of white adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and liver seen in these animals (15Yamauchi T. Kamon J. Waki H. Murakami K. Motojima K. Komeda K. Ide T. Kubota N. Terauchi Y. Tobe K. Miki H. Tsuchida A. Akanuma Y. Nagai R. Kimura S. Kadowaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41245-41254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). These results, in addition to the analysis of other PPARγ polymorphisms (11Knouff C. Auwerx J. Endocr. Rev. 2004; 25: 899-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 16Argmann C.A. Cock T.A. Auwerx J. Eur. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 35: 80-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), suggest that the receptor-mediated side effects associated with TZD treatment could potentially be decoupled from the insulin sensitization effect. In theory, a PPARγ ligand that could modulate receptor activity and mimic the effects observed with a P12A allele or PPARγ heterozygotes might abolish or at least reduce the unwanted side effects associated with full activation of the receptor while still triggering the physiologic responses that allow proper glycemic control.The PPARγ ligand-binding site is a large Y-shaped cavity with a total volume of ∼1,300 Å3, as seen in the apo-PPARγ crystal structure (17Nolte R.T. Wisely G.B. Westin S. Cobb J.E. Lambert M.H. Kurokawa R. Rosenfeld M.G. Willson T.M. Glass C.K. Milburn M.V. Nature. 1998; 395: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (1658) Google Scholar). Rosiglitazone binds in this pocket in a “U-shaped” conformation, wrapping around helix 3 with its central benzene ring directly behind helix 3 and the TZD head group extending toward the AF2 helix to form a direct H-bond with the hydroxyl moiety of the Tyr473 side chain. This interaction is critically important for stabilizing the AF2 helix in a conformation that interacts with coactivator proteins. Because this large binding pocket underlies the surface important for receptor interactions with coactivator and corepressor proteins (17Nolte R.T. Wisely G.B. Westin S. Cobb J.E. Lambert M.H.

Nature. 2002; 415: 813-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar), we reason that ligands bind to different regions of this large pocket, may differentially affect receptor-coregulatory protein interactions, and selectively modulate aspects of receptor activity.Here we describe a novel, potent, and selective PPARγ ligand, T2384, which may represent this new class of molecule. Using a variety of biochemical and cell-based assays, we demonstrate that T2384 binds to PPARγ in multiple conformations, each with potentially distinct biological activities in vitro. Moreover, we suggest that the unique in vitro properties of the ligand we have described might be responsible for this distinctive in vivo pharmacology. In rodent models of diabetes, T2384 effectively lowered plasma glucose and insulin levels without the induction of body weight gain and anemia.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESIn Vitro Reagents and Assay Protocols—Plasmids used, homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF) assay, ligand-binding assay, and transient transfection assay were all described previously (19Lee G. Elwood F. McNally J. Weiszmann J. Lindstrom M. Amaral K. Nakamura M. Miao S. Cao P. Learned R.M. Chen J.L. Li Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19649-19657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Briefly for HTRF assays, the reaction conditions were as follows: a 100-μl reaction volume contains 50 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 800 ng/ml anti-GST-(Eu)K antibody (PerkinElmer), 1 ng/ml GST-PPARγ, 1.5 μg/ml streptavidin conjugated with allophycocyanin (Streptavidin-APC, PerkinElmer), 200 nm biotin-peptide, 5 μl of compound in Me2SO as indicated in figure legends. GST-PPARγ/anti-GST-(Eu)K and biotin-peptide/streptavidin were pair-wise preincubated separately in 20 μl each for 1 h at room temperature before being combined with the remaining components for additional 1 h at room temperature. The reactions were set up in 96-well plates (black polypropylene, Whatman Inc.), and fluorescence was measured on LJL Analyst (LJL Bio-Systems). The data were expressed as the ratio, multiplied by a factor of 1000, of the emission intensity at 665 nm to that at the 620 nm.Mutagenesis was performed using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. All of the data in the manuscript are representative of at least two to three independent experiments, and the results are presented as the means of duplicate or triplicate determinations.Adipocyte Differentiation Assays—Isolated human preadipocytes were cultured and induced to differentiate as described by the manufacturer's (ZenBio, NC) protocol, except either rosiglitazone or T2384 was used in place of the PPARγ agonist in the supplied differentiation medium. The lipid content of the cells was measured with Nile Red staining (Molecular Probes #N1142).Protein Preparation—Human PPARγ LBD (residues 206–478) was PCR-cloned into a pET-30 vector (Novagen, WI) with an N-terminal His6 tag, and human RXRα LBD (residues 221–462) was in pET-15b vector (Novagen, WI) with an N-terminal His6 tag as well. Both proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells (Invitrogen) by growing in LB medium. The proteins were purified by a Ni+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen) and an anion exchange column of Mono-Q (Pharmacia) and then further purified by a gel filtration column of Superdex 75 (Pharmacia). For the heterodimer complex of PPARγ LBD and RXRα LBD, the two proteins were mixed and purified by a cation exchange column of Source 30S (Pharmacia) to remove the excess RXRα. The purified PPARγ LBD protein was concentrated to 1 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 5 mm dithiothreitol before mixing with 5-fold excess of T2384. The protein-ligand mixture was further concentrated to 5–7 mg/ml for crystallization. The purified heterodimer complex of PPARγ and RXRα was concentrated to 1 mg/ml before mixing with 5-fold excess of T2384 as well as 9-cis-retinoic acid and 2–3-fold excess of a coactivator peptide containing the LXXLL motif derived from helical domain one (TSHKLVQLLTTT) of SRC-1. The mixture was then concentrated to 5–7 mg/ml for crystallization.Crystallization—Cocrystals of wild-type PPARγ LBD with T2384 were grown at 20 °C by either hanging drop or sitting drop with 2.5 μl of the protein solution and 2.5 μl of the well solution containing 22–26% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.1 m Hepes, pH 7.5, and 0.2 m sodium acetate. Cocrystals of two mutant PPARγ LBDs with T2384 were obtained with the heterodimer of PPARγ/RXRα LBDs in the presence of 9-cis-retinoic acid and the coactivator peptide in 0.1 m Tris, pH 9.0, 25–27% polyethylene glycol 2000 monomethyl ether, 0.8 m sodium formate. The crystals were transferred into a well solution that contained an additional 15–20% (w/v) of ethylene glycol and then flash frozen in liquid nitrogen.Data Collection, Structure Determination, and Refinement—X-ray diffraction data sets were collected on synchrotron radiation beam lines 5.0.1 and 5.0.2 at the Advanced Light Source (Berkeley, CA). The data were integrated using either DENZO/SCALEPACK (20Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38355) Google Scholar) or MOSFLM (21Leslie A.G.W. Joint CCP4 + ESF-EAMCB Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1992; 26Google Scholar). The PPARγ crystals grew in space group C2 with unit cell dimensions a = 92, b = 63, c = 119 Å, β = 105°. The PPARγ/RXRα heterodimer crystals also grew in space group C2 with unit cells of a = 180, b = 54, c = 67 Å, β = 107°.The cocrystal structures of PPARγ LBD with T2384 were solved by molecular replacement using previously published PPARγ coordinates as a search model. The Protein Data Bank code of 2LBD was used for the PPARγ LBD cocrystal structure, and Protein Data Bank code of 1FM9 was used for the heterodimer cocrystal structures. Manual model building was carried out in Quanta (Accelrys), and refinement was carried out with both CNX (22Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S.

All blood sampling was performed from the retro-orbital plexus under ether anesthesia. The mice were singly housed and randomized into groups of n = 8/treatment group. Compounds were dissolved in ethanol and added to powdered diet (Purina 5053) and after drying overnight to allow for removal of ethanol, delivered to mice in preweighed food jars (day 1). On day 4 of the study, body weight change and food intake were determined, and blood was sampled and assayed for glucose and insulin. EDTA-treated blood samples were submitted for hematology and serum samples for clinical chemistry (Quality Clinical Labs, Mountain View, CA).RESULTST2384 Partially Activates PPARγ and Antagonizes Rosiglitazone Promoted Adipocyte Differentiation—T2384 is chemically distinct from the thiazolidinedione class of PPARγ agonist (Fig. 1A) but binds to the receptor with an affinity similar to that of rosiglitazone with a Ki of 200 nm (Fig. 1B) and shows specificity toward PPARγ (data not shown). Despite a similar affinity for PPARγ, these two ligands show distinct profiles in cell-based assays for receptor activation. Cell-based reporter gene assays in which HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with an expression construct containing the PPARγ LBD fused to the Gal4-DNA-binding domain, together with a luciferase reporter gene under the transcriptional control of the Gal4 upstream activating sequence (Gal4-UAS), were used to measure ligand-dependent effects on transcription mediated by PPARγ. In these cotransfection assays, rosiglitazone activated transcription by 12-fold, whereas in this same context, T2384 only partially activated the receptor (∼3-fold) with an EC50 value of 0.56 μm. Moreover, T2384 inhibited PPARγ transactivation in the presence of rosiglitazone (Fig. 1C), as expected for a partial agonist. Similar results have also been observed using a full-length receptor together with a luciferase reporter gene under the control of a DR1 sequence (data not shown).PPARγ agonists are known to promote the conversion of a variety of preadipocyte cell lines and primary cells into mature adipocytes. Therefore, we compared the ability of rosiglitazone and T2384 to stimulate triglyceride accumulation in preadipocytes (Fig. 1D). Incubation of isolated human preadipocytes with rosiglitazone resulted in their efficient conversion to adipocytes, as indicated by dramatically increased lipid accumulation in these cells. In contrast, T2384 treatment stimulated very little lipid accumulation in these cells (Fig. 1D). T2384 was able to efficiently antagonize the ability of rosiglitazone to convert the preadipocytes into adipocytes (Fig. 1D), consistent with its effects in the reporter gene assay (Fig. 1C).T2384 Can Adopt Multiple Conformations in the Ligand-binding Pocket of PPARγ—Binding of ligands to PPARγ triggers conformational changes that promote interactions between the receptor and an assortment of coregulatory proteins. These transcriptional regulatory proteins, including both coactivators and corepressors, mediate contact between the PPARγ-RXR heterodimer, chromatin, and the basal transcriptional machinery to promote activation or repression of target gene expression.To study T2384-bound PPARγ conformations and their effects on receptor and transcriptional regulatory protein interactions, a homogeneous HTRF based assay was developed (19Lee G. Elwood F. McNally J. Weiszmann J. Lindstrom M. Amaral K. Nakamura M. Miao S. Cao P. Learned R.M. Chen J.L. Li Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19649-19657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) using a panel of peptides derived from these regulatory proteins. Rosiglitazone showed an interaction profile characteristic of full agonists in these assays (Fig. 2). In contrast, T2384 induced a profile that was distinct both from rosiglitazone and a previously described PPARγ antagonist T0070907 (data not shown and Ref. 19Lee G. Elwood F. McNally J. Weiszmann J. Lindstrom M. Amaral K. Nakamura M. Miao S. Cao P. Learned R.M. Chen J.L. Li Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19649-19657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). For example, when a peptide derived from coactivator protein DRIP205 was used, T2384 showed a partial agonist profile at concentrations less than 0.1 μm and an antagonist profile at higher concentrations (Fig. 2A). This biphasic profile is also observed when a peptide from the NCoR corepressor protein was used. The first partial agonist phase, where the NCoR peptide is displaced from the receptor, is at concentrations lower than 0.1 μm, and the second antagonist phase, where NCoR peptide is recruited to the receptor, occurred at higher concentrations (Fig. 2B). One possible explanation for these intriguing observations is that T2384 is structurally flexible, adopting multiple conformations with different intrinsic affinities to the ligand-binding pocket of PPARγ. We speculate that these different conformations of T2384 and their unique interactions with the receptor may be responsible for the different activities seen.FIGURE 2T2384 induced unique profile in PPARγ-LBD and coactivator/corepressor interactions in biochemical assays.

T2384 displayed biphasic responses in both assays.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)More direct evidence for multiple binding conformations came from x-ray crystallographic analysis of T2384-bound PPARγ crystals. We solved the cocrystal structure of T2384 with the PPARγ ligand-binding domain to a resolution of 2.5 Å. Strikingly, the structure shows two crystallographically independent monomers, each with T2384 bound in a different conformation (Fig. 3, A and B). One monomer of PPARγ has one T2384 molecule in the ligand-binding pocket with T2384 wrapping around Cys285 from helix 3 in a U-shaped conformation (Fig. 3C), with B and C rings bind in a similar area as rosiglitazone (17Nolte R.T. Wisely G.B. Westin S. Cobb J.E. Lambert M.H. Kurokawa R. Rosenfeld M.G. Willson T.M. Glass C.K. Milburn M.V. Nature. 1998; 395: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (1658) Google Scholar). In this conformation, the A ring occupies the space between helix 7 and helix 3, which rosiglitzone does not exploit, and makes aromatic stacking interactions with Phe363. Hydrogen bonds are formed between Lys367 in helix 7 and one of the sulfonamide oxygen atoms of T2384, whereas the B ring is sandwiched between Cys285 of helix 3 and Leu330 of helix 5. The region between helix 3 and the β-sheet forms a pocket into which the C ring binds, and this region is defined as the U pocket. The high affinity binding between T2384 and PPARγ results from the single hydrogen bond and numerous hydrophobic interactions between the receptor and the bound ligand. Unlike full agonists, such as the TZDs or tyrosine analogs (17Nolte R.T. Wisely G.B. Westin S. Cobb J.E. Lambert M.H. Kurokawa R. Rosenfeld M.G. Willson T.M. Glass C.K. Milburn M.V.

Cell. 2000; 5: 545-555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar), T2384 shows no direct hydrogen bond interactions with the AF2 helix. Because stabilization of the AF2 helix in the activated conformation is a key characteristic of full agonism, the lack of direct interaction between this domain of the receptor and T2384 may explain the partial agonist/modulator activities of T2384 observed in vitro.FIGURE 3Structure of PPARγ ligand-binding domain in complex with T2384.

Testcross and genetic analyses revealed that among three germline chimeric G0 quail, one male produced transgenic offspring; of 310 hatchlings from the transgenic germline chimera, 24 were identified as donor-derived offspring, and 6 were transgenic (6/310, 1.9%). Conventional transgenesis using stage X blastodermal embryos was also conducted, but the efficiency of transgenesis was similar between the two systems (<1.6 vs. 1.9% for the conventional and gPGC-mediated systems, respectively). However, substantial advantages can be gained from gPGC-mediated method in that it enables an induced germline modification, whereas direct retroviral transfer to stage X embryos causes mosaic integration. The use of gonadal PGCs for transgenesis may lead to the production of bioreactors."

We have now tested the feasibility of using BLI to assess acute effects of the vascular disrupting agent combretastatin A4 phosphate (CA4P) on luciferase-expressing MDA-MB-231 human breast tumor cells growing as xenografts in mice. Following administration of luciferin substrate, there is a rapid increase in light emission reaching a maximum after about 6 min, which gradually decreases over the following 20 min. The kinetics of light emission are highly reproducible; however, following i.p. administration of CA4P (120 mg/kg), the detected light emission was decreased between 50 and 90%, and time to maximum was significantly delayed. Twenty-four hours later, there was some recovery of light emission following further administration of luciferin substrate. Comparison with dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI based on the paramagnetic contrast agent Omniscan showed comparable changes in the tumors consistent with the previous literature. Histology also confirmed shutdown of tumor vascular perfusion. We believe this finding provides an important novel application for BLI that could have widespread application in screening novel therapeutics expected to cause acute vascular changes in tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2024889386,"Fatty acid translocase (FAT/CD36) plays an important role in facilitating long chain fatty acid transport. FAT/CD36 gene deletion protects mice from high fat diet-induced obesity. In this study we have investigated the regulatory mechanism of FAT/CD36 expression at the transcription level. FAT/CD36 expression was activated during 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation, and FAT/CD36 protein levels were positively correlated with CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma. However, a negative correlation was detected between FAT/CD36 and C/EBPbeta. Overexpression of C/EBPalpha or C/EBPbeta increased FAT/CD36 mRNA and protein levels in several types of cells. Restoration of C/EBPalpha or C/EBPbeta expression in C/EBPalpha- or C/EBPbeta-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts increased FAT/CD36 expression. However, in mouse embryonic fibroblasts C/EBPalpha was a more potent activator of FAT/CD36 expression than was C/EBPbeta. Expression of C/EBPalpha robustly increased FAT/CD36 proximal promoter-directed luciferase expression in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. A C/EBP-responsive element was identified in the FAT/CD36 promoter by using 5' and specific site mutations. The binding of C/EBPalpha in the FAT/CD36 promoter was detected by chromatin immunoprecipitation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. These results demonstrated that C/EBPalpha regulates FAT/CD36 gene expression at the transcriptional level."
https://openalex.org/W2003621291,"Matriptase is a member of the novel family of type II transmembrane serine proteases. It was recently shown that a rare genetic disorder, autosomal recessive ichthyosis with hypotrichosis, is caused by a mutation in the coding region of matriptase. However, the biochemical and functional consequences of the G827R mutation in the catalytic domain of the enzyme have not been reported. Here we expressed the G827R-matriptase mutant in bacterial cells and found that it did not undergo autocatalytic cleavage from its zymogen to its active form as did the wild-type matriptase. Enzymatic activity measurements showed that the G827R mutant was catalytically inactive. When expressed in HEK293 cells, G827R-matriptase remained inactive but was shed as a soluble form, suggesting that another protease cleaved the full-length mature form of matriptase. Molecular modeling based on the crystal structure of matriptase showed that replacing Gly827 by Arg blocks access to the binding/catalytic cleft of the enzyme thereby preventing autocatalysis of the zymogen form. Our study, thus, provides direct evidence that the G827R mutation in patients with autosomal recessive ichthyosis with hypotrichosis leads to the expression of an inactive protease."

In this study, controlled proteolysis, EM, and single-particle three-dimensional reconstruction techniques were used to obtain the first insights into the three-dimensional structure of the BchH/ChlH subunit. We visualized substrate-induced conformational changes and mapped the N- and C-terminal domains on the three-dimensional reconstructions. Based on biochemical and structural characterization of truncated BchH polypeptides, we postulate that the N- and C-terminal regions bind Proto cooperatively with the aid of a flexible linker region that facilitates gating between the open and closed states. Production and Purification of BchH Protein—Plasmid pET15bBchH (21Willows R.D. Beale S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34206-34213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) contains the R. capsulatus bchH gene cloned into the pET15b vector (Novagen). The bchH gene encodes the magnesium chelatase BchH subunit, and when expressed from pET15bBchH, it obtains an N-terminal His tag. Plasmid pET15bBchH was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) pLys (Novagen), and the His-tagged BchH subunit was produced and purified as described (21Willows R.D. Beale S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34206-34213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) using a 1-ml Ni2+-chelating column (GE Healthcare) without addition of 5-aminolevulinic acid during expression to reduce the amount of endogenously bound Proto. Purified protein was desalted on NAP-5 columns (GE Healthcare) into 50 mm Tricine-NaOH, pH 8.0, 15 mm MgCl2, 4 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), and 6% glycerol. All purification and further handling of BchH were performed in darkness or under dim green light. Magnesium Chelatase Activity Assays—Aliquots of purified BchH were thawed quickly and kept on ice and in darkness for the entire assay procedure. Assays were performed in 100-μl volumes with 1.76 μg of BchH, 0.63 μg of BchI, and 0.79 μg of BchD. The reaction mixture contained 50 mm Tricine, pH 8.0, 15 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm phosphocreatine, phosphocreatine kinase (2 units/reaction), 4 mm ATP, and 1 μm Proto. Assays were incubated for 30 min at 32 °C, and the reaction was terminated with the addition of 10 volumes of Stop mix (acetone, H2O, 25% ammonia, 80:20:1, v/v/v) followed by centrifugation to remove precipitants. For magnesium protoporphyrin IX (Mg-Proto) detection, the supernatants were analyzed on a FluoroMax-2 spectrophotometer (Spex spectrofluorometer system, Jobin Yvon, Longjumeau, France) with excitation set at 412 nm and emission detected between 550 and 650 nm. Proteolysis and Mass Spectrometry—Proteolysis of BchH was performed under native conditions at an endoproteinase Glu-C (Roche Applied Science)/BchH ratio of 1:200. A mixture containing BchH at 0.2 μg/μl, with or without 1 μm Proto, was digested at 32 °C in 50 mm Tricine, pH 8.0, 15 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm DTT. A volume equivalent to 10 μg of BchH was removed at 5, 10, 15, 30, and 60 min and at 16 h; precipitated with 20 volumes of Stop mix; and centrifuged for 5 min at 16,100 × g. Pellets were resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and frozen until gel loading. The enzyme/substrate ratio was varied (1:50/1000/2000), and the same final digestion pattern was observed throughout. In-gel digestion with 100 ng/μl endoproteinase Glu-C was performed overnight at 37 °C. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectra were acquired with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as matrix on an Applied Biosystems 4700 proteomics analyzer with TOF/TOF™ optics (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany) in positive reflector mode as described previously (28Åhrman E. Lambert W. Aquilina A. Robinson C.V. Sundby Emanuelsson C. Protein Sci. 2007; 16: 1464-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 29Sirijovski N. Olsson U. Lundqvist J. Al-Karadaghi S. Willows R.D. Hansson M. Biochem. J. 2006; 400: 477-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Construction of Truncated BchH Subunits—Two His-tagged truncations of BchH were constructed. BchH-Ndom contains an N-terminal part (amino acid residues 1-733) of the BchH polypeptide, whereas BchH-Cdom contains a C-terminal part (amino acid residues 734-1194). The plasmid pET15bBchH (21Willows R.D. Beale S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34206-34213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) was used as a template for the construction of these truncated polypeptides using the PCR-mediated deletion method (30Hansson M.D. Rzeznicka K. Rosenbäck M. Hansson M. Sirijovski N. Anal. Biochem. 2008; 375: 373-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Proteins were expressed and purified as described for the full-length polypeptide. Porphyrin Binding to Protein—Equal amounts (1.85 μm) of the full-length polypeptide and the truncated variants were incubated separately with the various porphyrins (4 μm) in 50 mm Tricine, pH 8.0, 15 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The incubations were then processed on a 1-ml Ni2+-chelating column at room temperature. The loaded column was washed with the incubation buffer plus imidazole until the fluorescence of the fractions no longer exhibited the corresponding porphyrin peak. The protein was then eluted, and all fractions were analyzed for porphyrin content by fluorescence spectroscopy and for protein content by SDS-PAGE. Electron Microscopy—Carbon-coated 400-mesh copper grids (Ax-labs, Vedbæk, Denmark) were first washed for 1 min with a drop of 50 mm Tricine, pH 8.0, 15 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm DTT. Excess liquid was removed by brief contact with filter paper. Protein samples were diluted to 0.01 mg/ml with the wash buffer. A drop of the protein solution was applied to the grid for 1 min in darkness, and excess sample was removed. The grid was immediately stained with filtered 2% (w/v) uranyl acetate for 30 s, and excess stain was removed. EM was performed using a 120-kV Philips CM-10 microscope at ×55,000 magnification, giving a sampling size corresponding 4.67 Å/pixel. Particles from different micrographs were automatically selected using Boxer (31Ludtke S.J. Baldwin P.R. Chiu W. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 82-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (2108) Google Scholar). The first zero crossing of the contrast transfer function was determined using the ctfit program, and the individual particles were low-passed filtered accordingly. Using only integer shift to avoid interpolation artifacts, translational alignment was performed on all particles using EMAN software (31Ludtke S.J. Baldwin P.R. Chiu W. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 82-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (2108) Google Scholar). Rotationally aligned particles were classified using correspondence analysis and hierarchical ascendant classification as implemented in SPIDER (32Frank J. Radermacher M. Penczek P. Zhu J. Li Y. Ladjadj M. Leith A. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1816) Google Scholar). Initial models were generated by angular reconstitution and Fourier interpolation reconstruction as implemented in the EMAN suite of programs (31Ludtke S.J. Baldwin P.R. Chiu W. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 82-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (2108) Google Scholar). The models were refined iteratively by using the projection matching-based image classification algorithm in EMAN. Chemicals and Other Methods—Protein concentration was determined using Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. SDS-PAGE was performed according to Fling and Gregerson (33Fling S.P. Gregerson D.S. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 155: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar) with colloidal Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining (34Neuhoff V. Arold N. Taube D. Ehrhardt W. Electrophoresis. 1988; 9: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (2356) Google Scholar). Proto was purchased from Frontier Scientific Inc. (Logan, UT). Proto was first dissolved in a small volume of 1 m NaOH and resuspended in water. After centrifugation, the concentration was measured in 2.7 m HCl using an ϵ408 of 262 mm-1 cm-1 (35Falk J.E. Porphyrins and Metalloporphyrins. Elsevier Publishing Co., Amsterdam1964Google Scholar). EM and Single-particle Three-dimensional Reconstruction—We adsorbed recombinant R. capsulatus BchH preparations to carbon-coated grids before negative staining and imaging in the electron microscope. The micrographs revealed discrete entities of a size corresponding to that expected for BchH (Fig. 1A). A few representative views were selected from each micrograph, and additional images were selected semiautomatically using Boxer (31Ludtke S.J. Baldwin P.R. Chiu W. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 82-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (2108) Google Scholar). After two-dimensional alignment and classification, it became evident that the population contained particles in a broad distribution of views (data not shown). We therefore concluded angular reconstitution (36van Heel M. Ultramicroscopy. 1987; 21: 111-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar) to be a suitable method for ab initio reconstruction. The diameter of the BchH particles was measured to ∼100 Å, and no oligomerization was observed. Already at this stage it became clear that the BchH subunit exhibited a compact structure composed of bulbous domains, which in certain orientations possessed a pseudo 3-fold symmetry (Fig. 1B). Three-dimensional Reconstruction of the R. capsulatus Apo-BchH Subunit—After initial single-particle processing (see “Experimental Procedures”), which included translational and rotational alignment, the data set (5176 particles) was compressed to 20 dimensions by correspondence analysis. Reconstitution of the first eight eigenimages (Fig. 2A) revealed a tripartite appearance in factor numbers 6 and 8. Thus, the tripartite appearance did not appear to be a major source of variation in the data set, but confirmed the 3-fold symmetric views described above. Compression of the two-dimensional aligned data set was followed by hierarchical ascendant classification (37Lebart L. Morineau A. Warnick K.M. Multivariate Descriptive Statistical Analysis. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1984Google Scholar) into 77 classes. Of these classes, the 10 most dissimilar and most populated were chosen as a starting set for reference-free alignment. Five initial asymmetrical models were generated from alignments based on different starting sets of three distinctly different views. The models were very similar, and all converged to the same solution after three rounds of iterative alignment and model refinement (Fig. 3). One of these initial models was chosen and used for further rounds of iterative alignment and model refinement. To validate the final reconstructions, clusters of particles were sorted out on the basis of closeness to a set of quasi-evenly distributed Euler angle triplets using the Euclidean norm. For each of the clusters, the reconstructions were projected into the corresponding orientation. The resulting projection averages showed an excellent agreement with the projections (Fig. 1B). The resolution of the reconstructions was determined to ∼25 Å by using a fixed 0.5 Fourier shell correlation threshold value. Plots over the two non-azimuthal Euler angles (Fig. 4) demonstrated that data points were present in the entire Euler angle space, and the resolution was therefore concluded to be isotopic.FIGURE 3Initial models for the three-dimensional reconstruction of the apo-BchH subunit. Five asymmetrical models were generated from reference-free alignments based on different starting sets of three distinctly different views selected from the 10 most dissimilar and most populated classes. The models were very similar, and all converged to the same solution after three rounds of iterative alignment and model refinement. The boxed model was chosen and used for further rounds of iterative alignment and model refinement.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 4Determination of resolution at 0.5 Fourier shell correlation for apo-BchH (25 Å) (A) and BchH·Proto (28 Å) (B). Insets show distribution of particles into classes for the respective preparations, where circles represent a projection of the three-dimensional model, and the intensity is indicative of the number of particles in that class (black, <50; and white, >150) and shows that data points are present in the entire angle space for each data set.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) There are three major lobes of density extending from a flattened basal root along which lobes II and III extend. The bulk of lobe I stands perpendicular to lobes II and III. All lobes are approximately equal in size with the exception of an additional tilted “thumb”-shaped density at the tip of lobe I. Furthermore, a poorly defined “finger”-shaped density protruding from the tip of lobe III is present (Fig. 1C). The volume is 110 Å across the diagonal axis between lobe III and the thumb of lobe I and 90 Å across lobes II and III with a depth of 35-75 Å. The under-representation of the finger across a range of thresholds probably represents flexibility of this domain, i.e. an average of a range of positions it can occupy. Flexibility of protein domains often leads to poorly defined EM densities and sometimes to complete absence of the domain in a reconstruction (38Burgess S.A. Walker M.L. Thirumurugan K. Trinick J. Knight P.J. J. Struct. Biol. 2004; 147: 247-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 39Yang S. Yu X. Galkin V.E. Egelman E.H. J. Struct. Biol. 2003; 144: 162-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Proteolysis of Native Apo-BchH—As a way to probe the flexibility and domain organization of BchH, we conducted protease digestion under native conditions. The rationale behind this approach is that proteolysis can only occur at exposed flexible sites of the protein chain, which in multidomain proteins can result in the dissection of its constituent domains (40Fontana A. Polverino de Laureto P. De Filippis V. Scaramella E. Zambonin M. Folding Des. 1997; 2: 17-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 41Moradian-Oldak J. Jimenez I. Maltby D. Fincham A.G. Biopolymers. 2001; 58: 606-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Endoproteinase Glu-C specifically hydrolyzes peptide bonds at the carboxyl-terminal side of glutamyl and aspartyl residues. No cleavage will occur if a proline residue is on the carboxyl-terminal side (42Drapeau G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1976; 45: 469-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). In the case of R. capsulatus BchH, which contains 135 theoretical cleavage sites, the longest predicted peptide from a complete digestion is 35 residues, amino acids 232-266. Proteolysis experiments were conducted at pH 8.0, at which the BchH subunit exhibits maximum activity in a magnesium chelatase assay. A time course digestion showed that 120-, 80-, and 50-kDa polypeptides appeared after 5 min and steadily accumulated up to 2 h (data not shown). One major band of ∼45 kDa remained after 16 h digestion (Fig. 5, lane 2). We also examined the effect of substrate binding on the proteolytic sensitivity of BchH by preincubating the BchH subunit with Mg2+ and Proto. Mg2+ did not affect the digestion profile. In contrast, Proto had a stabilizing effect, the BchH subunit remained at its native size after 16 h digestion, and the 45-kDa fragment did not appear (Fig. 5, lane 3). Complete digestion of Bacillus subtilis ferrochelatase in the presence of Proto showed that addition of porphyrin did not inhibit Glu-C activity (data not shown). These findings suggest that a substrate-induced conformational change of sufficient magnitude occurs in BchH that increases structural rigidity and impedes initial proteolytic nicking of protein sequences that initiate the progressive degradation. The C-terminal Domain Is Resistant to Proteolysis—The 45-kDa fragment was excised from a denaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gel and digested with Glu-C. Analysis by mass spectrometry revealed peptides from the C terminus of BchH. The most N- and C-terminal peptides identified were 734GLHVV-GRPMTAEARAE749 and 1161ASDRNYWQPDPATLAALQAAADE1183, respectively, from a total polypeptide length of 1194 residues. The theoretical molecular mass of a BchH fragment containing residues 734-1183 is 48.7 kDa and agrees well with the observed size of the protease-resistant BchH fragment. Peptides from the 1184LEDRMEGVAAE1194 carboxyl-terminal end were not detected because either they are below the detection threshold of the mass spectrometer or they were cleaved during the native digest. According to the criteria of domain mapping by proteolysis (40Fontana A. Polverino de Laureto P. De Filippis V. Scaramella E. Zambonin M. Folding Des. 1997; 2: 17-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), the protein sequence flanking residue 734 is flexible and probably represents a dynamic linker region of the N- and C-terminal domains. N- and C-terminal Domains Are Required for Optimum Porphyrin Binding—We sought to understand the means by which substrate binding protects against proteolytic attack by first investigating whether the N- and C-terminal domains bind porphyrin. Expression clones of N- and C-terminal regions of the BchH polypeptide were constructed, using the site of the most N-terminal peptide identified in the 45-kDa Glu-C digestion fragment as the division point. BchH-Ndom includes residues 1-733, and BchH-Cdom includes residues 734-1194. Purified proteins were incubated with various porphyrins and then chromatographed on Ni2+-chelating columns to assess their ability to retain porphyrin (Fig. 6). The full-length polypeptide could both bind and retain deuteroporphyrin IX, Mg-deuteroporphyrin IX, and N-methylmesoporphyrin through the course of Ni2+ affinity chromatography. The estimated protein/porphyrin ratios (Fig. 6) agree with a single porphyrin-binding site that has been suggested for Synechocystis ChlH and Rhodobacter sphaeroides BchH (20Willows R.D.

https://openalex.org/W2002932650,"Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) has many important roles in mammalian cells, including contributing to the control of cell survival and proliferation. S1P is generated by sphingosine kinases (SKs), of which two mammalian isoforms have been identified (SK1 and SK2). To gain a better understanding of SK regulation, we have used a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify SK1-interacting proteins and established elongation factor 1A (eEF1A) as one such protein that associates with both SK1 and SK2. We show the direct interaction of eEF1A with the SKs in vitro, whereas the physiological relevance of this association was demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation of the endogenous proteins from cell lysates. Although the canonical role of eEF1A resides in protein synthesis, it has also been implicated in other roles, including regulating the activity of some signaling enzymes. Thus, we examined the potential role of eEF1A in regulation of the SKs and show that eEF1A is able to directly increase the activity of SK1 and SK2 approximately 3-fold in vitro. Substrate kinetics demonstrated that eEF1A increased the catalytic rate of both SKs, while having no observable effect on substrate affinities of these enzymes for either ATP or sphingosine. Overexpression of eEF1A in quiescent Chinese hamster ovary cells increased cellular SK activity, whereas a small interfering RNA-mediated decrease in eEF1A levels in MCF7 cells substantially reduced cellular SK activity and S1P levels, supporting the in vivo physiological relevance of this interaction. Thus, this study has established a novel mechanism of regulation of both SK1 and SK2 that is mediated by their interaction with eEF1A."
https://openalex.org/W2074312529,"Pathology data from the anthrax animal models show evidence of significant increases in vascular permeability coincident with hemostatic imbalances manifested by thrombocytopenia, transient leucopenia, and aggressive disseminated intravascular coagulation. In this study we hypothesized that anthrax infection modulates the activity of von Willebrand factor (VWF) and its endogenous regulator ADAMTS13, which play important roles in hemostasis and thrombosis, including interaction of endothelial cells with platelets. We previously demonstrated that purified anthrax neutral metalloproteases Npr599 and InhA are capable of cleaving a variety of host structural and regulatory proteins. Incubation of human plasma with these proteases at 37 °C in the presence of urea as a mild denaturant results in proteolysis of VWF. Also in these conditions, InhA directly cleaves plasma ADAMTS13 protein. Npr599 and InhA digest synthetic VWF substrate FRETS-VWF73. Amino acid sequencing of VWF fragments produced by InhA suggests that one of the cleavage sites of VWF is located at domain A2, the target domain of ADAMTS13. Proteolysis of VWF by InhA impairs its collagen binding activity (VWF:CBA) and ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation activity. In plasma from anthrax spore-challenged DBA/2 mice, VWF antigen levels increase up to 2-fold at day 3 post-infection with toxigenic Sterne 34F2 strain, whereas VWF:CBA levels drop in a time-dependent manner, suggesting dysfunction of VWF instead of its quantitative deficiency. This conclusion is further supported by significant reduction in the amount of VWF circulating in blood in the ultra-large forms. In addition, Western blot analysis shows proteolytic depletion of ADAMTS13 from plasma of spore-challenged mice despite its increased expression in the liver. Our results suggest a new mechanism of anthrax coagulopathy affecting the levels and functional activities of both VWF and its natural regulator ADAMTS13. This mechanism may contribute to hemorrhage and thrombosis typical in anthrax."

We recently determined the crystal structure of HSCARG, with functions previously unknown, and demonstrated it is an NADPH sensor, which undergoes restructuring and redistribution in response to changes of intracellular NADPH/NADP levels. In this study, we identified argininosuccinate synthetase (AS), a rate-limiting enzyme in nitric oxide synthesis, as capable of associating with HSCARG and demonstrated further that HSCARG decreased nitric oxide synthesis by down-regulating AS activity, whereas AS overexpression up-regulated hscarg mRNA transcription, suggesting a negative feedback mechanism. A decrease in the NADPH/NADP+ ratio, induced by dehydroepiandrosterone treatment, enhanced the interaction between HSCARG and AS, which resulted in stronger inhibition of AS activity and nitric oxide production. The dimerization region of HSCARG, amino acids 153-189, was identified to undergo critical interactions with AS. Furthermore, the viability of HSCARG RNA interference-treated epithelial cells decreased significantly, accompanied by an increase of the activity of caspase-3, which suggested that the loss of viability was because of apoptosis.

For this reason, NO production is not only limited by the regeneration of arginine but is also affected by the intracellular NADPH concentration, which requires cross-talk between the signaling pathways of NADPH and NO. In addition to its well known function in energy metabolism, NADH, along with its phosphorylated relative NADPH, has been recognized as an important regulatory molecule. Together, their roles are crucial in signaling pathways that control fundamental cellular processes, such as transcription, regulation of calcium homeostasis, and apoptosis (18Berger F. Ramirez-Hernandez M.H. Ziegler M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 111-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 19Ying W. Front.

NAD mainly exists in its oxidized state (NAD+), whereas NADP is largely found in its reduced form, NADPH (21Veech R.L. Eggleston L.V. Krebs H.A. Biochem. J. 1969; 115: 609-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 22Burch H.B. Bradley M.E. Lowry O.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 4546-4554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The predominant function of NADP is to maintain a pool in its reduced form to ensure a rapid regeneration of the defense systems to protect cells from oxidative damage. NADPH holds a key position in the cellular oxidative defense systems and is essential to NO synthesis, NADPH oxidase, and detoxifying pathways (23Pollak N. Niere M. Ziegler M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 33562-33571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 24Pollak N. Dolle C. Ziegler M. Biochem. J. 2007; 402: 205-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Because change of the intracellular ratio of NADPH/NADP+ affects many critical cellular metabolic processes, understanding the mechanisms and subcellular compartmentation of NADP+ and NADPH generation and their roles in cell physiology has attracted more attention recently (24Pollak N. Dolle C. Ziegler M. Biochem. J. 2007; 402: 205-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 25Park J. Chung J.J. Kim J.B. Diabetes Res. Clin. Pract. 2007; 77: 11-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (23) Google Scholar). NADP exerts its function by associating with and regulating NADP-dependent proteins. The crystal structure of HSCARG, which we determined, revealed that an asymmetrical dimer forms with one protein molecule bound with an NADP(H) molecule and the other unoccupied, and the two protein molecules have dramatically different conformation (26Zheng X. Dai X. Zhao Y. Chen Q. Lu F. Yao D. Yu Q. Liu X. Zhang C. Gu X. Luo M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 8809-8814Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Changes in intracellular NADPH/NADP+ levels induced the redistribution of HSCARG, which associates with intermediate filaments, to spread to the cytoplasm and nucleus, suggesting that HSCARG is an NADPH sensor (26Zheng X. Dai X. Zhao Y. Chen Q. Lu F. Yao D. Yu Q. Liu X. Zhang C. Gu X. Luo M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 8809-8814Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The structure switch of HSCARG upon NADP(H) binding suggested a new regulatory mechanism in response to changes of intracellular NADPH or NADP levels. However, many issues regarding the regulating mechanisms of HSCARG still remain unclear, e.g. how does HSCARG regulate intracellular redox balance, whether HSCARG modulates the other biosynthesis processes, and so on, and requires further investigation. In this study, we identified AS, one of the rate-limiting enzymes in NO synthesis, as a partner that could associate with HSCARG. The further assays indicated that HSCARG inhibited the production of NO by down-regulating AS activity. Decreased NADPH/NADP+ levels, which were induced by DHEA treatment, enhanced the interaction between HSCARG and AS and led to stronger inhibition of AS activity and NO production. The amino acids 153-189 of HSCARG, which are part of the NADPH binding sites and the dimerization interface, were found to be critical for AS interaction, which is consistent with the observation that NADPH concentration changes affected AS association with HSCARG. Furthermore, HSCARG was found to be essential for cell viability. Overexpression of HSCARG promoted cell proliferation, whereas the knockdown of HSCARG by RNAi treatment induced cell apoptosis. Thus, HSCARG is a regulatory protein that can sense intracellular levels of NADPH and balance NO production through the regulation of AS activity. Cell Culture and Plasmid Construction—HeLa and human embryonic kidney HEK293T cells were maintained in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone), at 37 °C and 5% CO2. AS and HSCARG cDNAs were inserted into prokaryotic expression vectors, pGEX-4T-1 (BamHI and NotI) and pET21DEST (Gateway cloning system), respectively, as well as into eukaryotic expression vectors, pRK-HA and pRK-FLAG, at the SalI and NotI enzyme restriction sites, respectively. To ascertain the critical region of HSCARG that binds to AS protein, we constructed a series of HSCARG truncates (Fig. 5A). HSCARG amino acid truncates 1-219, 1-189, 153-299, 190-299, and 220-299 were amplified from full-length HSCARG by PCR using corresponding primers. Amplified products were then inserted into the eukaryotic expression vector pRK-FLAG at the SalI and NotI enzyme restriction sites. The resulting plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing. Immunofluorescence Assay—The general determination for the subcellular localization of proteins was performed as described previously (26Zheng X. Dai X. Zhao Y. Chen Q. Lu F. Yao D. Yu Q. Liu X. Zhang C. Gu X. Luo M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 8809-8814Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Co-localization of HSCARG with AS was performed in HeLa cells that were co-transfected with FLAG-fused HSCARG and HA-tagged AS expression vectors. The cells were incubated with rabbit anti-HSCARG and monoclonal anti-HA antibody (Sigma), respectively, followed by fluorescent-labeled secondary antibodies (1:100 in phosphate-buffered saline), goat anti-rabbit IgG-TRITC, or goat antimouse IgG-fluorescein isothiocyanate and visualized by a laser scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 510). Nuclear DNA was stained with 1 μg/ml DAPI. To examine HSCARG redistribution induced by AS overexpression or SNAP treatment, HeLa cells were either transfected with AS expression vector alone for 48 h or cultured with medium containing 100, 200, or 500 μm SNAP for 24 h. Cells transfected with empty vector or cultured without SNAP were used as controls, respectively. Cells were then incubated with rabbit polyclonal antibody, specific to HSCARG, followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Zhongshan Biotech). Cells were counterstained with DAPI and visualized using confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 510). To investigate whether the effect of SNAP on HSCARG distribution is cGMP-dependent, cells were treated with 500 μm SNAP in the presence or absence of 5 μm LY83583, a guanylyl cyclase inhibitor, for about 20 h. Then the subcellular localization of HSCARG was detected following the method described above. Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extracts Preparation and Detection—Highly purified nuclear extractions of the cells that were treated with or without SNAP were obtained by using the nuclear-cytosol extraction kit (Applygen Technologies, Inc.), following the protocol of the manufacturer. Briefly, cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in Cytosol Extraction Buffer A. After incubation on ice for 10 min, Cytosol Extraction Buffer B was added. Cells were then left on ice for 1 min and centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C to separate cytosol from nuclei. The supernatant (cytosol extract) was transferred to a new tube and stored at -70 °C in 20% glycerol. The pellet containing crude nuclei was washed with Cytosol Extraction Buffer A, centrifuged, and resuspended in pre-cold Nuclear Extract Buffer. After incubation on ice for 30 min, the samples were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant containing nuclear extracts was transferred to a new tube. The nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were subjected to Western blotting analyses using the rabbit polyclonal anti-HSCARG. The Cdc2 and actin proteins were used as loading controls. In Vitro Pulldown Assay—Recombinant GST-fused AS and His-tagged HSCARG proteins were purified as described previously (27Dai X. Gu X. Luo M. Zheng X. Protein Pept. Lett. 2006; 13: 955-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The His pulldown assay was carried out by incubating nickel resin-associated recombinant His-tagged HSCARG with GST-fused AS protein at 4 °C for 3 h. The unbound proteins were removed using Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5). The remaining protein complex was eluted with 200 mm imidazole and separated using SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blot with anti-GST antibody. Control experiments were performed using only nickel resin-His-HSCARG-GST or nickel resin-GST-AS. GST pulldown assays were performed similarly by using GSH-Sepharose resin (BD Biosciences)-associated GST-fused AS protein and polyclonal anti-HSCARG antibody for Western blot detection. To study the effect of NADPH on the interaction between AS and HSCARG, a GST pulldown assay was performed. GSH-Sepharose resin, which was bound to 10 μg of GST or GST-AS protein, was incubated with 10 μg of HSCARG proteins that contained various concentrations of NADPH for 3 h at 4 °C. The bound protein complex was subsequently eluted with 10 mm GSH buffer and detected by Western blot analysis using anti-GST and anti-HSCARG antibodies, respectively. Co-immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—To examine HSCARG-AS interactions, co-immunoprecipitation and Western blot analyses were carried out according to procedures described previously (26Zheng X. Dai X. Zhao Y. Chen Q. Lu F. Yao D. Yu Q. Liu X. Zhang C. Gu X. Luo M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 8809-8814Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). RNAi Treatment and Verification—Four separate RNAi duplexes of HSCARG, hscarg1-4, were designed and inserted into the pGCsi vector. The target sequences for HSCARG cDNA are as follows: 1) CCTCATGGTGGACAAGAAA; 2) GCCTCCACTATGTGGTCTA; 3) CCAAGATGACCAGGTCATC; and 4) CCTTCATCGTGACCAATTA. The plasmids were subsequently transfected into HEK293T cells using Lipofectamine 2000, according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). pGCsi-nonsilence was used as a negative control. Cells were collected 48 h post-transfection; the total RNAs and proteins were extracted, followed by RT-PCR and Western blot analyses to examine the effects of RNAi at both the mRNA and protein levels (28Zhao Y. Sun H. Lu J. Li X. Chen X. Tao D. Huang W. Huang B. J. Exp. Biol. 2005; 208: 697-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In Vitro AS Activity Assay—To examine the effect of HSCARG protein on AS activity, we assessed the accumulation of inorganic phosphate, which was produced as a reaction to AS catalyzing argininosuccinate synthesis, in the absence or presence of HSCARG. Equal amounts of AS and HSCARG proteins were added to each reaction, which contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 0.5 mm asparagine, 0.4 mm citrulline, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, and 2 units/ml pyrophosphatase in a final volume of 30 μl. Reactions were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C in 96-well microtiter plates. Subsequently, 120 μl of fluorescence reaction mixture (0.5% sulfuric acid, 0.25 mm ammonium molybdate, 0.05 mm hydrochloric thiamine) was added and incubated for 5 min at 37 °C, followed by termination with 120 μl of borax (100 mm). The accumulation of inorganic phosphate in the samples was measured on Synergy HT (BioTek Instrument) with excitation at 360 nm and emission at 460 nm. Results were compared with an inorganic phosphate standard curve that was made with KH2PO4. Detection of NO Production—A fluorometric method was used to determine cellular NO production released into the medium (29Misko T.P. Schilling R.J. Salvemini D. Moore W.M. Currie M.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 214: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar). HSCARG was either overexpressed or knocked down by transfection of the corresponding plasmids into HEK293T cells in 6-well plates, respectively. Thirty six hours after transfection, the medium containing 10% fetal calf serum was removed, and 1 ml of Hanks' balanced salt solution buffer (1.26 mm CaCl2·2H2O, 5 mm KCl, 0.4 mm KH2PO4, 0.8 mm MgSO4·7H2O, 137 mm NaCl, 4 mm NaHCO3, 0.3 mm Na2HPO4, 5.5 mm glucose) was added, in the presence or absence of 100 μm DHEA. Media were then collected after 12 h, and the living cells were counted after trypan blue staining. 10 μl of freshly made 0.05 mg/ml 2,3-diaminonaphthablene (dissolved in 0.62 m HCl) was added to 100 μl of medium, followed by incubation at 20 °C for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 5 μl of 2.8 m NaOH. The intensity of the fluorescent signal produced by the product 2,3-diaminonaphthotriazole was measured by excitation at 365 nm and emission at 450 nm on the Synergy HT (BioTek Instrument). To calculate the production of NO, NaNO2 was used to make the standard curve. The NO released by per 106 living cells was calculated. The effects of HSCARG truncations on NO production were examined followed the same procedure. To check the influence of HSCARG on NO production in macrophage RAW 264.7 cells, cells were infected with or without the HSCARG recombinant adenoviruses. 48 h after infection, the NO released was determined as described above. Cell Viability Assay—HEK293T cells were transfected with pRK-FLAG-HSCARG, HSCARG RNAi plasmids, and corresponding control vectors, respectively. Meanwhile, part of the HSCARG-depleted cells were either treated with 500 μm l-N(G)-nitroarginine methyl ester (l-NAME), a nonselective nitric-oxide synthase inhibitor, or 1 or 3 mm glutathione monoethyl ester (GSE), a well established membrane-permeable GSH donor. Forty hours later, cell viability was determined by the CellTiter 96® AQueous nonradioactive cell proliferation assay, according to the manufacturer's instruction (Promega). Cells grown in a 96-well plate were incubated with tetrazolium compound, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt, and an electron coupling reagent (phenazine methosulfate) for 1-4 h at 37 °C. The absorbance of the converted formazan by viable cells was measured at 490 nm. A standard curve was made by using a concentration series of cells, and cell viability was calculated subsequent to the different treatments. Apoptosis Detection by Measurement of the Caspase 3 Activity—To measure the activity of caspase-3 (DEVDase), HEK293T cells were transfected with effective HSCARG RNAi plasmid and its control nonsilence vector, respectively. Forty eight hours after transfection, cells were collected, and the activity of caspase-3 was measured by using the CaspACE™ assay system from Promega, according to the manufacturer's instruction (Promega). The p-nitroanilide released from the substrate, upon cleavage with DEVDase, was monitored by a spectrophotometer at 405 nm (DNM-9602, Prolong). The concentration of total proteins of each extract was also determined by the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) method (Applygen Technologies, Inc.), using a bovine serum albumin standard curve. The relative level of p-nitroanilide, which indicated caspase-3 activity, was normalized against the protein concentration. GSH Analysis—Cells that transfected with HSCARG RNAi plasmid were collected, and the GSH content of the cell lysates was determined by using a GSH assay kit (Beyond) followed the manufacturer's protocol. AS, One of the Rate-limiting Enzymes of NO Production, Was Identified as the Partner That Interacts Directly with HSCARG—To identify the target proteins with which HSCARG may associate, immunoprecipitation experiments using anti-HSCARG sera were performed. Several specific bands were observed in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A), and mass spectrometry analysis revealed that AS, one of the rate-limiting enzymes in NO production, may be one of the target proteins that associate with HSCARG. The interaction between HSCARG and AS was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1B) (26Zheng X. Dai X. Zhao Y. Chen Q. Lu F. Yao D. Yu Q. Liu X. Zhang C. Gu X. Luo M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 8809-8814Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To further verify the physical interaction of these two proteins, an in vitro pulldown assay was performed using purified HSCARG and AS proteins (Fig. 1C). In the His pulldown assay, GST-tagged AS indicated an apparent affinity for HSCARG (Fig. 1C, left). In GSH-Sepharose resin, which was loaded with GST-AS, His-tagged HSCARG was found to bind at high levels (Fig. 1C, right). Immunofluorescence analysis, using antibodies specific to HSCARG and HA, illustrated that HSCARG co-localized with AS protein. As shown in Fig. 1D, there was an obvious overlap between HSCARG (red) and AS (green) in the cytoplasm, mainly surrounding the nucleus. This result further validated the intracellular interaction of HSCARG with AS. Unexpectedly, we found that a fraction of HSCARG entered the nucleus when it was co-overexpressed with AS (Fig. 1D), whereas our previous studies showed that under normal culture conditions HSCARG was located primarily in the cytoplasm surrounding the nucleus (26Zheng X. Dai X. Zhao Y. Chen Q. Lu F. Yao D. Yu Q. Liu X. Zhang C. Gu X. Luo M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 8809-8814Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This new observation prompted us to examine the subcellular localization of HSCARG in AS-overexpressed cells. Increase of NO Affects the Subcellular Localization and Expression of HSCARG—To assess whether overexpression of AS could alter the subcellular localization of HSCARG, cells were transfected with an AS expression plasmid, and the localization of HSCARG was mapped using anti-HSCARG polyclonal antibody. Cells transfected with an empty vector were used as controls. Compared with control cells, a fraction of HSCARG was clearly present in the nucleus of AS-transfected cells (Fig. 2A), indicating that overexpression of AS induced redistribution of HSCARG to the nucleus, where HSCARG might exert a potential regulatory role in gene activation by analogy to C-terminal binding protein (30Zhang Q. Piston D.W. Goodman R.H. Science. 2002; 295: 1895-1897PubMed Google Scholar, 31Fjeld C.C. Birdsong W.T. Goodman R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9202-9207Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Recent studies demonstrated that AS is essential for endothelial NO production, and overexpression of AS increases the production of NO (13Xie L. Gross S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16624-16630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To test whether HSCARG redistribution induced by AS overexpression is because of an increase in NO production modulated by AS, cells were treated with different concentrations (100, 200, and 500 μm) of SNAP, which is a NO donor, followed by an examination of the subcellular localization of HSCARG. In cells treated with 200 and 500 μm SNAP, NO released by SNAP indeed resulted in the re-localization of HSCARG; a visible amount of HSCARG, especially in the cells treated with 500 μm SNAP, shifted to the nucleus, compared with control cells devoid of the SNAP treatment (Fig. 2B and supplemental Fig. 1). In addition, HSCARG fluorescence intensity increased as well (Fig. 2B). Western blot analysis of the nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts following SNAP treatment revealed that in the nuclei of unstimulated cells, HSCARG can only be detected at a very low level, whereas in the SNAP-stimulated cells, the concentration of HSCARG is much higher (Fig. 2C), which further supports our immunofluorescence observations. These results demonstrated that an intracellular NO increase could induce redistribution of HSCARG, similar to the effects observed with DHEA (26Zheng X. Dai X. Zhao Y. Chen Q. Lu F. Yao D. Yu Q. Liu X. Zhang C. Gu X. Luo M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 8809-8814Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Because production of NO induces cGMP elevation (32Dimmeler S. Zeiher A.M. Nitric Oxide. 1997; 1: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 33Moncada S. Higgs A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 329: 2002-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (5724) Google Scholar), to examine whether the redistribution of HSCARG induced by SNAP treatment is because of the increase of cGMP, cells were treated with SNAP in the presence or absence of LY83583, a cGMP inhibitor, and then the subcellular localization of HSCARG was determined. Our results showed that the addition of LY83583 inhibited the accumulation of HSCARG in the nucleus induced by SNAP treatment, and less HSCARG was shown in nuclear cells compared with the cells treated with SNAP alone (supplemental Fig. 2), suggesting that the effect of SNAP on the HSCARG redistribution is cGMP-dependent. To investigate the effects of AS overexpression and SNAP treatment on gene expression of HSCARG, the total RNAs of the corresponding cells were extracted, and RT-PCR analyses were performed. Results demonstrated that not only the overexpression of AS but also the SNAP treatment could up-regulate hscarg expression (Fig. 2D), which was consistent with the immunofluorescence analysis (Fig. 2, A and B). Because NO production has been shown to be closely related to inflammation, and the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β has previously been shown to up-regulate expression and activity of AS (34Brasse-Lagnel C. Lavoinne A. Fairand A. Vavasseur K. Deniel N. Husson A. Biochimie (Paris). 2006; 88: 607-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), we performed additional experiments to determine whether proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β and TNFα, could also affect the expression of hscarg. RT-PCR analyses revealed that both IL-1β and TNFα induced an increase in hscarg gene expression at the transcriptional level (Fig. 2E), indicating that HSCARG might also be involved in the regulation of inflammation. This is associated with the vital roles that NADPH plays in the immune defense system (23Pollak N. Niere M. Ziegler M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 33562-33571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 24Pollak N. Dolle C. Ziegler M. Biochem. J. 2007; 402: 205-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar), and further work is required to delineate its mechanism. HSCARG Is a Negative Regulator of NO Production and AS Activity—Through the experiments presented above, we found that HSCARG directly interacts with AS (Fig. 1), and its functions are closely related to NO production, as shown by NO-induced redistribution of HSCARG (Fig. 2). Subsequently, to test whether HSCARG express"
https://openalex.org/W2118088031,"Differential expression, activity, phosphorylation, and oligomerization of tau play a critical role during neuronal development and in a number of age-related neurodegenerative diseases. An experimental system that accurately models the molecular changes involved in tauopathies, particularly changes in tau isoform activity, requires the expression at physiological levels of the full complement of tau isoforms present in the adult human brain. To this end, we analyzed tau expression in human cortical neurons (HCNs) in culture. Here, we show that the isoform profile of tau in HCNs is similar to that in the adult human brain and that isoform expression is regulated during neuronal development and by cellular substrates. Interestingly, 4R tau exhibited a distinct pattern of expression and subcellular localization, suggesting the presence of specific functional roles for tau isoforms in HCNs. Tau phosphorylation, microtubule binding, and subcellular localization were markedly altered by pharmacological manipulation of tau-directed phosphatase activities, which also induced the appearance of tau oligomeric forms associated with memory loss in animal models of tauopathy. Thus, experimentally induced changes in tau activity and function in HCNs recapitulate critical features of tauopathies that may lead to neuronal dysfunction and degeneration in the human brain."

However, methods for probing such interactions are lacking. Methodology has been developed and validated to measure specific molecular-receptor interactions on living human colorectal cancer cells as in vitro models for the gut epithelium. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to measure ligand-receptor interactions and to map receptor locations on cell surfaces. Measurements were made using silica beads attached to the AFM tip-cantilever assembly, which were functionalized by coupling of ligands to the bead surface. Wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) binds to the glycosylated extracellular domain III of the epidermal growth factor receptor. Methodology was tested by measuring binding of WGA to the surface of confluent monolayers of living Caco-2 human intestinal epithelial cells. The measured modal detachment force of 125 pN is typical of values expected for single molecule interactions. Adhesive events were used to map the location of binding sites on the cell surface revealing heterogeneity in their distribution within and between cells within the monolayer."
https://openalex.org/W2159391450,"Neoculin (NCL) is a sweet protein that also has taste-modifying activity to convert sourness to sweetness. However, it has been unclear how NCL induces this unique sensation. Here we quantitatively evaluated the pH-dependent acid-induced sweetness of NCL using a cell-based assay system. The human sweet taste receptor, hT1R2-hT1R3, was functionally expressed in HEK293T cells together with G alpha protein. When NCL was applied to the cells under different pH conditions, it activated hT1R2-hT1R3 in a pH-dependent manner as the condition changed from pH 8 to 5. The pH-response sigmoidal curve resembled the imidazole titration curve, suggesting that His residues were involved in the taste-modifying activity. We then constructed an NCL variant in which all His residues were replaced with Ala and found that the variant elicited strong sweetness at neutral pH as well as at acidic pH. Since NCL and the variant elicited weak and strong sweetness at the same neutral pH, respectively, we applied different proportions of NCL-variant mixtures to the cells at this pH. As a result, NCL competitively inhibits the variant-induced receptor activation. All these data suggest that NCL acts as an hT1R2-hT1R3 agonist at acidic pH but functionally changes into its antagonist at neutral pH."

There are at least 13 proteins acting in the pathway, with the FANCD2 protein apparently functioning as a late term effecter in the maintenance of genome stability. We find that the chromatin remodeling protein, Tip60, interacts directly with the FANCD2 protein in a yeast two-hybrid system. This interaction has been confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and co-localization using both endogenous and epitope-tagged FANCD2 and Tip60 from human cells. The observation of decreased cellular survival after exposure to mitomycin C in normal fibroblasts depleted for Tip60 indicates a direct function in interstrand cross-link repair. The coincident function of Tip60 and FANCD2 in one pathway is supported by the finding that depletion of Tip60 in Fanconi anemia cells does not increase sensitivity to DNA cross-links. However, depletion of Tip60 did not reduce monoubiquitination of FANCD2 or its localization to nuclear foci following DNA damage. The observations indicate that Fanconi anemia proteins act in concert with chromatin remodeling functions to maintain genome stability after DNA cross-link damage.

The post-translational modification of FANCD2 is required for localization of FANCD2 to damage-induced foci in the nucleus and for FA pathway function maintaining normal genome stability after ICL formation (5Garcia-Higuera I.

Remodeling of chromatin structure surrounding DNA damage appears to be required for optimal DNA repair and may be needed for efficient loading of proteins involved in DNA repair after several types of DNA damage, including double strand breaks (DSB) (7Montes de Oca R.

For example, histone H2AX is modified by phosphorylation (γH2AX) by DNA-PK, ATR, or ATM kinases, following DNA damage or strand breaks (11Wang H. Wang M. Wang H. Bocker W. Iliakis G. J. Cell.

Thus there is evidence that chromatin modifications are directly involved in DNA repair and genome stability. Tip60, a histone acetyltransferase (16Yamamoto T. Horikoshi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30595-30598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) that was first identified as a human immunodeficiency virus Tat-interacting protein (17Kamine J. Elangovan B. Subramanian T. Coleman D. Chinnadurai G. Virology. 1996; 216: 357-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), has been implicated in DSB repair (18Ikura T. Ogryzko V.V. Grigoriev M. Groisman R. Wang J. Horikoshi M. Scully R. Qin J. Nakatani Y. Cell. 2000; 102: 463-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar) and as a co-regulator of transcription for a number of proteins, including p53, c-Myc, and others (reviewed in Refs. 19Sapountzi V.

Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 433-442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The acetyltransferase site resides in a conserved motif in the C-terminal region of the protein. Tip60 is a component of a conserved chromatin remodeling complex (21Doyon Y. Cote J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2004; 14: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 22Doyon Y. Selleck W. Lane W.S. Tan S. Cote J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1884-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar), which is homologous to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae NuA4 complex. The yeast homolog of Tip60, Esa1, in the NuA4 complex, is essential for viability. The Drosophila homolog of Tip60 is involved in acetylation and exchange of histones surrounding DSBs (23Kusch T. Florens L. Macdonald W.H. Swanson S.K. Glaser R.L. Yates J.R. 3rd Abmayr S.M. Washburn M.P. Workman J.L. Science. 2004; 306: 2084-2087Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). In addition to histones, Tip60 acetylates several target proteins that are involved in DNA repair or checkpoint responses to DNA damage, including p53 (23Kusch T. Florens L. Macdonald W.H. Swanson S.K. Glaser R.L. Yates J.R. 3rd Abmayr S.M. Washburn M.P. Workman J.L. Science. 2004; 306: 2084-2087Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar) and ATM (24Sun Y. Jiang X. Chen S. Fernandes N. Price B.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13182-13187Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Tip60 also co-localizes with γH2AX in DNA damage-induced foci (24Sun Y. Jiang X. Chen S. Fernandes N. Price B.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13182-13187Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Recently Tip60 has been demonstrated to acetylate H2AX and thereby regulate its ubiquitination by UBC13 during DSB repair (25Ikura T. Tashiro S. Kakino A. Shima H. Jacob N. Amunugama R. Yoder K. Izumi S. Kuraoka I. Tanaka K. Kimura H. Ikura M. Nishikubo S. Ito T. Muto A. Miyagawa K. Takeda S. Fishel R. Igarashi K. Kamiya K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 20: 7028-7040Crossref Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Thus Tip60 is a chromatin remodeling protein for which there is evidence of function in genome stability following DNA damage. As a result of a yeast two-hybrid screen for proteins that interact with FANCD2, we identified Tip60 as a FANCD2-interacting protein. The interaction was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and co-localization of Tip60 and FANCD2 in damage-induced foci. Mutagenesis of the acetyl-CoA-binding site of Tip60 abrogates the interaction with FANCD2, but FANCD2 does not require monoubiquitination to interact. To facilitate monitoring the interaction, epitope-tagged FANCD2 constructs were used in some instances, after demonstrating the functionality of the constructs by complementation of Fancd2 cells for genome stability following mitomycin C (MMC) treatment. Depletion of Tip60 sensitizes cells to the DNA cross-linking agent MMC, but depletion of Tip60 in FA cells does not further sensitize them to ICL agents. Depletion of Tip60 did not reduce formation of FANCD2-Ub or localization of FANCD2 to nuclear foci following ICL formation. Therefore the action of Tip60 must not be in the function of the FA core required for FANCD2-Ub formation. We conclude that Tip60 functions in DNA interstrand cross-link repair, interacting with FANCD2, and that the action of Tip60 is epistatic to the FA pathway. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—A 2751-bp EcoRV-BglII fragment covering amino acid 55–971 of FANCD2 cloned into the SmaI and BamHI sites of pGBKT7 (Clontech), respectively, was transformed into yeast strain AH109 (Clontech), which was mated with yeast strain Y187 (Clontech) pretransformed with a human fetal brain cDNA library. Approximately 2 × 106 diploid colonies growing on complete medium were plated onto synthetic dropout plates lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine. Approximately 300 colonies that arose under this triple selection were then streaked onto synthetic dropout plates lacking tryptophan, leucine, histidine, and adenine supplemented with 1 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole. Approximately 50 colonies survived this quadruple selection, and plasmids were recovered and sequenced. After rejection of genomic clones and out-of-frame sequences, candidate plasmids were retransformed into Y187 and mated with AH109 carrying pGBKT7-FANCD2(55–971) to confirm the interactions by plating on synthetic dropout plates lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine, with X-α-Gal (Clontech) as a reporter of β-galactosidase induction. The cell extracts were also assayed for β-galactosidase activity using O-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma), following the yeast two-hybrid Matchmaker protocol (Clontech). Plasmids and Constructs—Full-length Tip60 cDNA was amplified from a human lymphocyte cDNA library (a gift from Manual Buchwald) with primers Tip60-1 (5′-CACAGAATTCGGGAAGATGGCGGAGGTGG) and Tip60-2 (5′-CACACTCGAGTCACCACTTCCCCCTCTTGC) and cloned into pCMVTag-2B (Stratagene) to generate a FLAG-tagged construct. Tip60 was subcloned into pGex6P-1 (GE Healthcare), pGADT7, and pGBKT7 (Clontech). All three known splice variants of Tip60 were obtained as individual clones, verified by sequencing. Full-length FANCD2 cDNA was subcloned into pAc5.1 (Invitrogen), and the C-terminal V5 and His6 epitope tags, along with the FANCD2 coding sequence, were subcloned into pMMPpuro as pMMPpuro-FANCD2-V5His. For N-terminal epitope-tagged FANCD2, pMMPpuro was modified by adding a synthetic multicloning site that included restriction sites for Eco47III and XhoI. The His6 and V5 cassette was then subcloned into the modified pMMPpuro vector, via NcoI and Eco47III, to yield pMMPpuro-HV. The FANCD2 coding sequence was then amplified, using primers FAD-47III (5′-CACAAGCGCTATGGTTTCCAAAAGAAGACTGTC) and FAD-17 (5′-CACACTCGAGCTAATCAGAGTCATAACTCTC) and cloned into the Eco47III and XhoI sites of pMMP-puro-HV. Pirh2 coding sequence was amplified from a human fetal limb cDNA library using primers pirh2-F (5′-CACAGAATTCATGGCGGCGACGGCCCGG) and pirh2-R (5′-CACAGGATCCTTGCTGATCCAGTGAAAT), cloned into pGADT7 (Clontech). Control pGADT7-FANCA was described previously (26Folias A. Matkovic M. Bruun D. Reid S. Hejna J. Grompe M. D'Andrea A. Moses R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 2591-2597Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Control FANCG coding sequence was amplified with primers MEM-13 (5′-CACAGAGGCCAGTGAATTCATGTC) and MEM-12 (5′-CACAGTCGACCAGGTCACAAGACTTTGGCAGAG, digested with EcoRI and SalI, and cloned into pBridge (Clontech). Routine cloning was with Escherichia coli XL1-Blue MRF′ cells (Stratagene). Immortalized Human Fibroblast Cells—Immortalized GM639, HEK293, GM6914 (FA-A) (NIGMS, National Institutes of Health Human Genetic Cell Repository), PD20 (FA-D2), and PD331 (FA-C) (Oregon Health & Science University Fanconi Anemia Cell Repository) cells were cultured in α-minimum Eagle's medium (Mediatech) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), 5% calf serum (Hyclone), and 0.1% gentamicin (Invitrogen) in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. To generate cell lines stably expressing epitope-tagged FANCD2, the pMMPpuro-FANCD2-V5His construct was packaged in AM12 cells (ATCC), and the viral supernatant was used to transfect PD20 cells. Puromycin-resistant clones were evaluated for functional complementation as defined by normal levels of radial formations after treatment with MMC. Antibodies, Immunoblotting, and Immunoprecipitations—Anti-Tip60 (N-17) (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies), anti-V5 (Invitrogen), monoclonal anti-FANCD2 (Santa Cruz), anti-Tip49 (Abcam), anti-c-Myc (Santa Cruz), anti-FLAG (Sigma), and anti-hemagglutinin (Santa Cruz), were used according to the vendors' recommendations. The blots were visualized by Western Lightning ECL reagent or Millipore ECL reagent and exposure on x-ray film. The immunoblots were performed as described (30Miller J. Stagljar I. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 261: 247-262PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by dye binding (Bio-Rad). For immunoprecipitations, ∼1 mg of extract protein was precleared by adding 6.5 μg of normal mouse serum and 50 μl of protein A/G Plus agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After incubation for 1 h at 4 °C, the beads were removed by centrifugation. Immunoprecipitations with α-V5 used ∼1 mg of precleared extract and 2.5 μg of α-V5 antibody. After binding the α-V5 antibody overnight at 4 °C, 30 μl of protein A/G Plus agarose beads were added, incubated 1 h at 4 °C, and then centrifuged 15 min at 3000 rpm at 4 °C. The beads were then washed three times with 500 μl of lysis buffer, mixed gently for 5 min, and then centrifuged as before. The final bead pellet was resuspended in 80 μl of loading dye consisting of 60 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.1 m dithiothreitol, and 0.001% bromphenol blue and then heated 3 min at 85 °C, followed by centrifugation for 5 min at 3000 rpm to remove beads. The proteins were resolved on 7.5% denaturing acrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes for immunoblotting. Immunoprecipitations of transiently expressed FLAG-tagged Tip60 from HEK293 cells with anti-FLAG antibody were carried out as for the anti-V5 antibody, and control immunoprecipitations were performed with extracts from nontransfected cells. Immunoprecipitation of endogenous FANCD2 from GM639 extracts was carried out as above, but monoclonal anti-FANCD2 antibody was used in place of anti-V5. GST Fusion Pulldown—The GST fusion pulldown assay was adapted (27Frangioni J. Neel B. J. Cell. Sci. 1993; 105: 481-488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as was the interaction assay (28Schmutte C. Sadoff M. Shim K. Acharya S. Fischel R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33011-33018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). GST-Tip60β and GST were grown in BL21 Codon Plus RIL cells (Stratagene) in 10 ml of LB and induced for 4 h with 2 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The cells were harvested, washed in PBSE (PBS plus 1 mm EDTA), and lysed in 0.6 ml of PBSE supplemented with 100 μg/ml lysozyme, chilled on ice 15 min, at which time dithiothreitol was added to 5 mm; phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to 1 mm with lysis by freeze-thawing, 0.6 ml of a 50% slurry of DE52 cellulose (Whatman) equilibrated in 0.3 m KPO4, pH 7.0, was added, and the lysate was cleared by centrifugation. An additional 100 μl of the DE52 slurry was added, mixed, and centrifuged as before. Triton X-100 in PBSE was added to a final concentration of 1.5% to the lysate. 130 μl of a 50% slurry of GSH-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in PBSE were added and rotated 3 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed three times with 0.5 ml of PBSE, pelleted by centrifugation at 2000 rpm, 5 min, 4 °C, and then resuspended in 65 μl of PBSE. 10 μl of the slurry were removed and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining. Bound GST fusion protein concentrations were estimated from the Coomassie-stained gel, using a serial dilution of bovine serum albumin for a standard curve. Approximately 2 μg of GST-Tip60β and GST bound to GSH-Sepharose beads, respectively, were then transferred to clean microcentrifuge tubes and equilibrated in Buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Tween 20, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1× Complete protease inhibitor mixture without EDTA (Roche Applied Science)) by centrifugation and resuspension in 100 μl of Buffer A. Approximately 250 mg of GM639 cleared whole cell extract in Buffer A was added to each sample and rotated 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed three times with 0.5 ml of Buffer A by centrifugation and removal of the supernatant. The final bead pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of SDS-PAGE sample loading dye, and 20 μl was analyzed by immunoblot. Immunofluorescence—The cells were seeded onto glass coverslips. The following day, the cells were transfected with Tip60 siRNA. On day 2, the cells were treated with 80 ng/ml MMC (Sigma). After another 16 h, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. The coverslips were then washed once with PBS and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 (Sigma) in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. The coverslips were again washed with PBS and then blocked with 15% fetal bovine serum in PBS for 1 h at 37 °C. Blocking buffer was then replaced with anti-V5 and anti-Tip60 antibodies, diluted 1:500 and 1:100, respectively, in blocking buffer, 1 h at 37 °C. The coverslips were then washed three times with PBS supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma), for 5 min each wash. Secondary antibodies (Texas Red donkey anti-mouse IgG (Abcam) and AlexaFluor 488 donkey anti-goat IgG (Invitrogen)), diluted 1:1000 in blocking buffer were then added and incubated 1 h at 37 °C. The coverslips were washed three times with PBS supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20 as before, followed by mounting of coverslips on slides with 30 μl of Prolong Gold antifade reagent with 4′,6′-diamino-2-phenylindole (Invitrogen) and curing 24 h in the dark. The slides were examined with a Nikon Eclipse 80i fluorescent microscope, and the images were captured with Elements Basic Research and Image-J (National Institutes of Health) software. siRNA Transfection, DNA Damage, Cell Survival, and Cytogenetics—Transfections with plasmid DNA used Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Transfections with siRNA were performed as previously described (29Bruun D. Folias A. Akkari Y. Cox Y. Olson S. Moses R. DNA Repair. 2003; 2: 1007-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Controls were transfected with either a nonfunctional siRNA duplex or mock transfected. The transfection efficiency was monitored with transfections of labeled siRNAs (FAM Silencer siRNA labeling kit (Ambion)). For controls, a nonfunctioning duplex with the following sequence was used: AAC UUU UGC AAA GCG GAG CCA UU. Tip60 and Tip49 Smartpool siRNA and the nonfunctioning siRNA were from Dharmacon. Cell survival analysis was by colony survival, as described (29Bruun D. Folias A. Akkari Y. Cox Y. Olson S. Moses R. DNA Repair. 2003; 2: 1007-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Chromosome breakage analysis was performed by the Cytogenetics Core Lab at Oregon Health & Science University as previously described (29Bruun D. Folias A. Akkari Y. Cox Y. Olson S. Moses R. DNA Repair. 2003; 2: 1007-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Yeast Two-hybrid Screen Identifies Tip60 as a FANCD2-interacting Protein—The yeast two-hybrid system allows precise definition of protein-protein interaction by prototrophic growth or reporter gene expression (β-galactosidase) because of translation of cDNA sequences fused to a binding domain sequence or transcriptional activation domain sequence when both domains are occupied (30Miller J. Stagljar I. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 261: 247-262PubMed Google Scholar). A yeast two-hybrid screen for FANCD2-interacting proteins was done using a FANCD2 N-terminal construct comprising amino acid 55–971 as bait, fused to the binding domain (Fig. 1A) and a commercially available human fetal brain cDNA library fused to the activation domain. Screening was done by mating cells carrying the FANCD2 bait with cells carrying the library and selecting for growth of the diploids on synthetic drop-out medium. Fifty ADE+ HIS+ clones obtained from screening two million clones were sequenced. After rejecting false positives, six clones, representing four candidate genes, remained. Tip60 was represented by two independent clones from different plates. The C-terminal 228 amino acids present in these clones included the catalytic acetyl-CoA-binding site of the acetyltransferase (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 2Interacting subclones. A, subclones of FANCD2, with interaction with Tip60 indicated as +. The K561R mutation prevents monoubiqutination of FANCD2. B, subclones of Tip60, with interaction with FANCD2 indicated as +. d.m., double mutant.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Confirmation of the FANCD2-Tip60 interaction was done by transformation of yeast with the rescued Tip60 clones and mating with yeast carrying the original FANCD2 (amino acids 55–971) bait. In addition, full-length Tip60 cDNAs (both Tip60α and Tip60β PLIP variants were used interchangeably, with the same results) were cloned into the activation domain of vector pGADT7 and tested with FANCD2 as bait. The rescued FANCD2-interacting clones, as well as the full-length Tip60β constructs, interacted with FANCD2 as demonstrated by growth in the absence of adenine and histidine (Fig. 1B). The FANCD2-Tip60 interaction was verified by switching the bait and prey, i.e. subcloning the FANCD2 insert into the activation domain and the Tip60 clones into the binding domain (Fig. 1B), again producing prototrophic growth. The reporter gene β-galactosidase was also induced on X-α-Gal plates (Fig. 1B). Interaction of FANCA and FANCG was done for comparison, because this interaction is well established (26Folias A. Matkovic M. Bruun D. Reid S. Hejna J. Grompe M. D'Andrea A. Moses R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 2591-2597Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 31Medhurst A.L. Huber P.A. Waisfisz Q. de Winter J.P. Mathew C.G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 423-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The interaction was also indexed by liquid β-galactosidase assays (Fig. 1C) and showed a level of induction comparable with Pirh2-Tip60, a known Tip60 interaction (32Logan I.R. Sapountzi V. Gaughan L. Neal D.E. Robson C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11696-11704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Because the original interacting clones were partial cDNA sequences carrying the C-terminal half of Tip60, the results demonstrate that the FANCD2-interacting domain resides in the C-terminal half of Tip60. There are no FA homologs in yeast, and we have not observed evidence of FANCD2-Ub, with or without DNA damage, in yeast extracts. Immunoblotting of FANCD2 constructs from yeast cells showed a single band (Fig. 1D). Therefore, as expected, site-directed mutagenesis of FANCD2 lysine 561 (the site of FANCD2 monoubiquitination) to arginine did not alter the interaction with Tip60 (Fig. 1D). We also tested whether the acetyl-CoA-binding site of Tip60 was essential for the interaction with FANCD2. Two critical amino acids, asparagine 377 and glycine 380, were mutated to glutamate. These alterations abrogated the FANCD2-Tip60 interaction (Figs. 1D and 2B). The same mutations have been shown to impede DSB repair and apoptosis in human cells (18Ikura T. Ogryzko V.V. Grigoriev M. Groisman R. Wang J. Horikoshi M. Scully R. Qin J. Nakatani Y. Cell. 2000; 102: 463-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). Additional subclones of FANCD2 were tested for the ability to interact with Tip60 (Fig. 2). Deletion of exons 10–13 of FANCD2 (amino acid 248–359) eliminated the interaction (Fig. 1D). FANCD2 subclones spanning amino acid 55–415 and 672–1167 also failed to interact with Tip60, thus localizing the Tip60-interacting region of FANCD2 to amino acid 248–672. Thus the FANCD2-Tip60 interaction depends on an intact acetyl-CoA-binding site, part of the acetyltransferase catalytic site, but does not require FANCD2-Ub. Epitope-tagged FANCD2 Protein Is Functional—As a useful aid for immunoprecipitation studies, we made epitope-tagged FANCD2 constructs. Retroviral expression constructs incorporating the V5 and His6 epitope tags at either the N or C terminus of FANCD2 were packaged, and the viral supernatants were used to transfect PD20 (fancd2) cells. After stable transfectants were selected, individual clones showed varying degrees of FANCD2 expression (Fig. 3). This was easily monitored because PD20 does not manifest significant FANCD2 by immunoblot (Fig. 3). The clones were screened for FANCD2 function by scoring chromosomal aberrations after treatment with MMC. A number of independent, functionally complemented clones with C-terminal or N-terminal tagged FANCD2 protein were obtained. The genome stability of the clones after MMC treatment was comparable with normal cells or a PD20 derivative that had been complemented by microcell-mediated chromosome transfer (33Hejna J.A. Timmers C.D. Reifsteck C. Bruun D.A. Lucas L.W. Jakobs P.M. Toth-Fejel S. Unsworth N. Clemens S.L. Garcia D.K. Naylor S.L. Thayer M.J. Olson S.B. Grompe M. Moses R.E. Am. J. Hum.

The overall efficiency of stable puromycin clone derivation was very low compared with other transfections based on the viral vector, approximately a thousand-fold lower. This observation is compatible with exogenous expression of FANCD2 being toxic to the cell. In an a"
https://openalex.org/W1968948024,"Vitamin B12, the antipernicious anemia factor, is the cyano derivative of adenosylcobalamin, which is one of nature's most complex coenzymes. Adenosylcobalamin is made along one of two similar yet distinct metabolic pathways, which are referred to as the aerobic and anaerobic routes. The aerobic pathway for cobalamin biosynthesis proceeds via cobalt insertion into a ring-contracted macrocycle, which is closely followed by adenosylation of the cobalt ion. An important prerequisite for adenosylation is the reduction of the centrally chelated metal from Co(II) to a highly nucleophilic Co(I) form. We have cloned a gene, cobR, encoding a biosynthetic enzyme with this co(II)rrin reductase activity from Brucella melitensis. The protein has been overproduced, and the resulting flavoprotein has been purified, characterized, and crystallized and its structure determined to 1.6Å resolution. Kinetic and EPR analysis reveals that the enzyme proceeds via a semiquinone form. It is proposed that CobR may interact with the adenosyltransferase to overcome the large thermodynamic barrier required for co(II)rrin reduction. Vitamin B12, the antipernicious anemia factor, is the cyano derivative of adenosylcobalamin, which is one of nature's most complex coenzymes. Adenosylcobalamin is made along one of two similar yet distinct metabolic pathways, which are referred to as the aerobic and anaerobic routes. The aerobic pathway for cobalamin biosynthesis proceeds via cobalt insertion into a ring-contracted macrocycle, which is closely followed by adenosylation of the cobalt ion. An important prerequisite for adenosylation is the reduction of the centrally chelated metal from Co(II) to a highly nucleophilic Co(I) form.

It is proposed that CobR may interact with the adenosyltransferase to overcome the large thermodynamic barrier required for co(II)rrin reduction. Cobalamin (vitamin B12) is a coenzyme that is associated with a range of isomerization, methylation, and dehalogenation reactions, utilizing the unique chemistry of the carbon-cobalt bond that is characteristic of this molecule (1Banerjee R. Ragsdale S.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 209-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). The octahedral geometry of the functional cobalt ion in cobalamin necessitates a structurally complex molecule that consists of a corrin ring, a lower nucleotide loop, and an upper ligand that is either a methyl group in methylcobalamin or an adenosyl group in adenosylcobalamin. The corrin ring is a modified tetrapyrrole and as such bears a structural resemblance to molecules such as heme, chlorophyll, siroheme, and coenzyme F430, reflecting a common synthesis of the tetrapyrrole template as part of a broader branched metabolic pathway (2Warren M.J. Raux E. Schubert H.L. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2002; 19: 390-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). However, cobalamin differs from these other modified tetrapyrroles in two important aspects. First, the carbon framework of the corrin molecule has been contracted such that one of the integral carbons of the tetrapyrrole progenitor has been removed to afford a smaller central cavity into which the cobalt ion is bound. Second, cobalamin provides both upper and lower ligands for the cobalt to complement the ligands provided by the nitrogens from the four pyrrole-derived units of the macrocycle. Central to the role played in catalysis by cobalamin-containing enzymes is the cobalt ion, which forms a unique cobalt-carbon bond with either an upper adenosyl (adenosylcobalamin) or methyl (methylcobalamin) group. It is the physical properties of this bond that mediate the scintillating chemistry associated with B12-dependent transformations (1Banerjee R. Ragsdale S.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 209-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). There is thus some considerable interest in how this bond is formed in the biosynthesis of vitamin B12 (2Warren M.J. Raux E. Schubert H.L. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2002; 19: 390-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). The biosynthesis of cobalamin is a highly complex process, requiring around 30 enzyme-mediated steps for its de novo construction (2Warren M.J. Raux E. Schubert H.L. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2002; 19: 390-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). The attachment of the upper axial ligand occurs comparatively late in the pathway, after the corrin ring has been synthesized. The attachment of the upper axial ligand requires first reduction of the cobalt ion to Co(I) and second adenosylation, with the transfer of the adenosyl group from ATP (3Debussche L. Thibaut D. Cameron B. Crouzet J. Blanche F. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7430-7440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). There are at least two distinct ways in which nature carries out the reduction of the central cobalt ion within the corrin ring. In organisms that operate the anaerobic pathway for cobalamin biosynthesis, there is no dedicated enzyme for cobalt reduction (4Fonseca M.V. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4304-4309Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This conclusion has been reached from a study of the anaerobic biosynthetic B12 operons found in many eubacteria in which no specific reductase gene appears to be encoded. Molecular genetic approaches have also failed to find a reductase gene that is dedicated to B12 biosynthesis (4Fonseca M.V. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4304-4309Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, other biochemical approaches have shown that the ferredoxin (flavodoxin):NADP+ reductase and flavodoxin A proteins can serve as electron donors for the reduction of co(III)rrinoids to co(I)rrinoids in vitro and are therefore likely also to act in vivo (5Fonseca M.V. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32101-32108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In contrast, along the aerobic pathway, a specific enzyme for the reduction of co(II)rrinoid to co(I)rrinoid has been reported in Pseudomonas denitrificans, which acts as soon as the cobalt ion has been inserted into the macrocycle (Fig. 1). In this work, the Rhone Poulenc group isolated an NADH-dependent flavoenzyme exhibiting cob(II)yrinic acid a,c-diamide reductase activity and sequenced its N terminus (6Blanche F. Maton L. Debussche L. Thibaut D. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7452-7454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This enzyme of the cobalamin biosynthetic pathway reduced to the Co(I) state all of the Co(II)-corrinoids isolated from this micro-organism, indicating a broad substrate specificity. Despite the N-terminal sequencing, the authors were unable to identify the gene encoding this enzyme (7Blanche F. Cameron B. Crouzet J. Debussche L. Thibaut D. Vuilhorgne M. Leeper F.J. Battersby A.R. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1995; 34: 383-411Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In this study we have exploited a bioinformatics approach to identify an orthologous cobalt reductase gene located in a cobalamin biosynthetic operon in the bacterium Brucella melitensis. This gene was cloned and expressed, and the encoded protein (CobR) was structurally and functionally analyzed to provide the first systematic characterization of a cobalamin biosynthetic corrinoid reductase. Molecular Biology—To enable high level expression in Escherichia coli, the cobR and cobO genes were amplified by PCR using genomic DNA from B. melitensis as a template. Details of the cloning procedures are given in the supplemental material. Recombinant Protein Overproduction and Purification—The plasmid bearing the cobR gene was transformed into E. coli BL12 DE3 pLysS and grown in LB containing 50 mg/liter ampicillin and 30 mg/liter chloramphenicol with aeration at 37 °C. Upon reaching an A600 of 1, the culture was induced with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.4 mm), and growth was continued overnight at 16 °C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation (20 min, 3,500 × g) and resuspended in 10 ml of binding buffer (0.5 m NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). Cell lysis was achieved by sonication, and the recombinant protein was purified using immobilized metal affinity chromatography using a column loaded with nickel. Further details are given in the supplemental material. Activity Assay—Corrin reductase activity was measured as described previously (6Blanche F. Maton L. Debussche L. Thibaut D. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7452-7454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR)—EPR and ENDOR 3The abbreviations used are: ENDOR, electron nuclear double resonance; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. spectra were obtained using a Bruker ELEXSYS E500/580 EPR spectrometer operating at X-band. Temperature control was effected using Oxford Instruments ESR900 and ESR935 cryostats interfaced with an ITC503 temperature controller. Experimental conditions were as given in the figure legends. Identification of Bound Flavin Cofactor—The purified enzyme was denatured by the addition of ice-cold trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 5%. The solution was centrifugation in a bench-top centrifuge to remove precipitate. The supernatant was decanted and neutralized with the addition of 2 m K2HPO4, 10 μl of which was injected onto an Ace 5 AQ column (4.6 × 210 mm, 5 μm, Advanced Chromatography Technologies) run on an Agilent 1100 series HPLC equipped with on-line diode array and fluorescence detectors at a flow rate of 1 ml min-1. Flavin cofactors were separated isocratically using 25% methanol in 20 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.5, as the eluent. The fluorescence emission at 525 nm was monitored with the excitation wavelength set at 445 nm. Identification of species was based on the comparison of the retention time with that of commercial standards. Redox Potentiometry—Redox titrations were performed in a Belle Technology glove box under a nitrogen atmosphere as described previously. Further details are given in the supplemental material (8Dutton P.L. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 54: 411-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar, 9Munro A.W. Noble M.A. Robledo L. Daff S.N.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13421-13429Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Crystal Structure of CobR—Purified CobR following removal of the His tag was concentrated to 50 mg ml-1. Bright yellow crystals were obtained using 0.5-1.0 m Li2SO4 and 15-20% polyethylene glycol 800 in hanging drop vapor diffusion experiments. CobR crystallized in space group P212121 with four molecules in the asymmetric unit. Crystals were vitrified by briefly soaking them in mother liquor augmented with 20% (v/v) glycerol before plunging them into liquid nitrogen. Se-Met-labeled CobR was used for de novo structure determination using Se-Met SAD-phasing methods. Data collected (720 degrees of data) at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ID29) were processed and scaled using MOSFLM (11Leslie, A. G. W. (1992) Joint CCP4 + ESF-EAMCB Newsletter on Protein Crystallography, No. 26Google Scholar) and the CCP4 (12Collaborative Computational Project No. 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (19770) Google Scholar) program suite. After phase generation using autoSHARP (13de La Fortelle E. Bricogne G. Charles Jr., W. Carter Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar), using four selenium sites, an almost complete model was built using the automatic building procedure ARP/wARP (14Lamzin V.S. Wilson K.S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 269-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Subsequent cycles of manual model refinement in O (15Jones T.A. Zou J.T. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar) and refinement with REFMAC 5 (16Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13870) Google Scholar) produced the final model at 1.6 Å resolution with one flavin bound per dimer and an Rwork of 18.3% and an Rfree of 22.3% (Table 1). FMN was seen bound to CobR, rather than FAD, even when crystals were soaked in fresh FAD immediately prior to data collection.TABLE 1Crystallographic statisticsHigh resolutionSelenium peak dataWavelength (Å)0.88560.9797Resolution (Å)1.62.2Rmerge6.4 (22.5)aThe overall resolution range is 42.8 to 1.60 Å and in parentheses 1.69 to 1.60 Å for the high resolution data set and 58.5 to 2.2 Å and in parenthesis 2.32 to 2.20 Å for the peak data set.8.8 (20.6)Mean I/σ(I)18.6 (6.8)35.6 (18.5)Unique reflections97,683 (13,967)38,415 (5482)% Completeness99.7 (99.2)100.0 (100.0)Multiplicity3.6 (3.5)28.9 (29.2)b720° of data were collected to optimize data quality and facilitate SAD phasing.Mid slope anomalous probability1.0531.836Rwork18.3%Rfree22.3%r.m.s. bond lengths (Å)0.006 (0.021)cFor the stereochemical data, the root mean square (r.m.s.) deviations are given, and in parentheses the target (σ) value is shown.r.m.s. bond angle (°)1.046 (1.955)r.m.s. chiral (Å3)0.069 (0.200)Ramachandran plot (%)Allowed98.6%dLeu-101 and Ser-140 have clear electron density but fall outside the allowed region of the Ramachandran plot where they account for the disallowed 1.4%.B-factors (Å2)eThe mean B-factor from the Wilson plot for the high resolution data was 13.8 Å2.Protein11.3FMN15.6Waters35.5a The overall resolution range is 42.8 to 1.60 Å and in parentheses 1.69 to 1.60 Å for the high resolution data set and 58.5 to 2.2 Å and in parenthesis 2.32 to 2.20 Å for the peak data set.b 720° of data were collected to optimize data quality and facilitate SAD phasing.c For the stereochemical data, the root mean square (r.m.s.) deviations are given, and in parentheses the target (σ) value is shown.d Leu-101 and Ser-140 have clear electron density but fall outside the allowed region of the Ramachandran plot where they account for the disallowed 1.4%.e The mean B-factor from the Wilson plot for the high resolution data was 13.8 Å2. Open table in a new tab Substrate Binding—When CobR crystals were soaked in NAD (0.5 mm for 10 min), no NAD was seen in the resulting electron density. However, NAD binding could be modeled using the NAD-bound to flavin reductase (Protein Data Bank code 1RZ0). The flavin reductase-NAD complex and CobR superimpose with a root mean square deviation of 1.8 Å over 1571 equivalenced atoms (17DeLano, W. L. (2002) The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, DeLano Scientific LLC, San Carlos, CAGoogle Scholar), and superimposition of the two proteins brings the NAD of the flavin reductase into a sterically most plausible position in the CobR cavity. Identification and Cloning of the Cobalt Reductase—The cobalt reductase was identified from BLAST searches conducted with the published N-terminal sequence (NH2-MEK-TRL) of the P. denitrificans corrin reductase enzyme (6Blanche F. Maton L. Debussche L. Thibaut D. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7452-7454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This led to the identification of SMc00514 in S. meliloti, which was annotated as being a putative monooxygenase. This sequence was then used in further BLAST searches that produced a list of analogous proteins from a wide range of organisms. From this list a gene encoding an orthologue from B. melitensis (BMEI0709) was identified within a cobalamin biosynthetic operon (supplemental Fig. S1). This provided further circumstantial evidence that this protein is likely to be involved in vitamin B12 biosynthesis and is a plausible candidate for the corrinoid reductase. This gene, which has been termed cobR, encodes a protein consisting of 173 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 18.7 kDa and has primary sequence similarity to a number of flavoproteins, including the smaller reductive component of the 4-hydroxyphenylacetate 3-monooxygenase (either HpaC from E. coli or Phe(A2) from Geobacillus thermoglucosidasius A7) (supplemental Fig. S1) (18Arunachalam U. Massey V. Vaidyanathan C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25848-25855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Prieto M.A. Garcia J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22823-22829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Some sequence similarity was also observed with PduS (data not shown), a cobalamin reductase that is required for the activation of the diol dehydratase as part of the propanediol utilization metabolosome (20Sampson E.M. Johnson C.L.V. Bobik T.A. Microbiology. 2005; 151: 1169-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To investigate the activity of CobR, the gene was amplified by PCR from the genomic DNA of B. melitensis and cloned into the vector pET-14b to allow the encoded protein to be produced recombinantly with an N-terminal His tag. Purification and Characterization of CobR—The cobalt reductase was purified to homogeneity by metal chelate chromatography and gel filtration (supplemental Fig. S2). The isolated protein was highly soluble, and the solution was bright yellow in color. The UV-visible absorbance spectrum is typical of a flavoprotein, with absorption maxima at 380 and 455 nm and characteristic shoulders at 430 and 485 nm (supplemental Fig. S2). The flavin bound to CobR was identified after the noncovalent cofactor was extracted from the protein by the addition of ice-cold trichloroacetic acid. Following the removal of the precipitate by centrifugation, the supernatant was decanted and neutralized to prevent hydrolysis of FAD. Analysis by reverse phase HPLC revealed that the extracted cofactor exhibited a retention time similar to authentic FAD (supplemental Fig. S3). However, a small quantity of FMN was also present in the extract, which may represent either a limited hydrolysis of the FAD during the extraction procedure or indicate that a small fraction of the purified CobR contains bound FMN. Based on the integral of the peaks, the ratio of FAD to FMN was estimated to be 6:1. Moreover, mass spectral analysis of the flavin, also extracted after acid denaturation of the purified protein, revealed that the major species had a mass consistent with FAD (supplemental Fig. S4). The observation that FAD is the natural cofactor is further supported by fluorescence titrations of both FMN and FAD with the CobR apoprotein (Fig. 2 and Equation 1). F=Fend+Fδ(dCF−(CA+Kd+dCF)−(CA+Kd+dCF)2−4CAdCF2)(Eq. 1) where F is the observed emission intensity after each addition; Fend is the remaining emission intensity at the end of the titration; Fδ is the difference in emission intensity between 1 μm free flavin and 1 μm CobR; CA is the total protein concentration after each addition (apo + holo); Kd is the dissociation constant of the apoflavin complex in μm units; CF is the starting concentration of flavin; and d is the dilution factor of this initial concentration (initial volume/total volume) after each addition. The dissociation constants (Kd) for the complexes formed between oxidized FMN and FAD with the apoCobR protein were determined by titrating apoCobR (obtained by dialysis of CobR against guanidine (2 m) and KBr (2 m)) into a known concentration of flavin. By fitting the observed fluorescence as a function of apoCobR concentration, a Kd of 230 ± 27 nm for FAD and 648 ± 46 nm for FMN was determined. Reduction of CobR—Addition of either NADH or NADPH to a solution of CobR under anaerobic conditions results in bleaching of the cofactor, which is consistent with the reduction of the bound flavin to the 2e- reduced hydroquinone form. Reductive titration against dithionite also revealed that the flavin undergoes an apparent direct reduction to the hydroquinone form, which is inferred from the bleaching of the chromophore and the appearance of an isosbestic point at 340 nm (Fig. 3). This reductive titration was completed over the pH range 4-9, and no significant pH-dependent spectral changes were observed. Equally, no semiquinone formation was observed following rapid mixing of CobR against dithionite by stopped-flow methods. Overall, this indicates rapid disproportionation of the semiquinone and suggests that CobR provides no thermodynamic stabilization for this intermediate. Redox Potentiometry—In light of the particularly negative redox potential required for the reduction of a corrionoid to the Co(I) state, -610 mV (21Lexa D. Saveant J.M. Acc. Chem. Res. 1983; 16: 235-243Crossref Scopus (383) Google Scholar), an investigation into the midpoint redox potential for the flavin housed within CobR was undertaken. A solution of CobR in phosphate buffer at pH 7.0 containing 10% (v/v) glycerol was subjected to a reversible spectro-electrochemical titration using dithionite as the reductant and subsequently ferricyanide for the re-oxidation. No hysteresis was observed in oxidative and reductive directions. The data collected at 455 nm (reflecting maximal changes in spectral properties between oxidized and the 2e- reduced enzyme) was fitted to the Nernst equation, which gave an apparent midpoint reduction potential of -207 ± 3 mV for the quinone/hydroquinone transition (Fig. 3). Corrinoid Reductase Activity—Purified CobR was assayed for Co(III) reductase activities using biosynthetic precursors that included cobyrinic acid, cobyrinic acid a,c-diamide, and cobinamide as well as cobalamin (Fig. 4a). The specific activity for CobR in the presence of NADH for cobyrinic acid was found to be 4 and 13 μmol/min/mg for cobyrinic acid a,c-diamide, 15 μmol/min/mg for cobinamide, and 22 μmol/min/mg for aqua cobalamin. To determine whether CobR is able to perform the reduction of Co(II) corrinoids to Co(I), a coupled assay in which any Co(I) product formed was converted into the corresponding adenosylated derivative by the adenosyltransferase was used. The conversion of cob(II)alamin into adenosylcobalamin was monitored spectrophotometrically by the corresponding increase in absorbance at 525 nm and quantified using the difference in the molar extinction coefficient of Δϵ525 = 4.8 mm-1 cm-1 between cob(II)alamin and the product (Fig. 4b). Unlike adenosylcobalamin, the β-adenosylated form of cobinamide is yellow, and accordingly, the product of the reaction can be followed by the change in the molar extinction coefficient at 469 nm (Fig. 3b), which was estimated to be Δϵ469 = 2.7 mm-1 cm-1. The rates of adenosylcobalamin and adenosylcobinamide formation by CobR were found to be at least 3.4 and 9.2 nmol/min/mg, respectively. These values represent minimal rates of activity because the enzyme was not measured under optimal conditions within the confines of the coupled assay. No activity was detected when CobR was omitted from the reaction mixture, and no additional flavin was required for reductase activity. The UV-visible spectra of completed reactions were characteristic of their respective adenosylated derivatives and comparable with previously published data (22Thomas M.G. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4227-4233Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Moreover, after photolysis of the product for 15 min using a 150-watt tungsten lamp at a distance of 20 cm, the optical spectrum returned to that of Co(II) starting material, which is consistent with loss of the adenosyl group. Co(II)rrin reduction activity could also be detected by alkylating the co(I)rrin form by iodoacetic acid in the absence of the adenosyltransferase (data not shown). CobR Forms a Flavin Semiquinone Radical during Turnover—Evidently, as the enzyme is able to perform the reduction of co(II)rrinoids, CobR must be able to promote the transfer of a single electron from the flavin cofactor to the substrate. This process must proceed through the formation of a flavin semiquinone radical, although reductive methods using dithionite followed by UV-visible spectroscopy have failed to yield this key intermediate (Fig. 3). However, it was possible to identify the flavin semiquinone radical either by employing EPR to monitor single turnover of the reduced enzyme with cob(III)alamin in the forward direction or by reduction of the oxidized protein with cob(I)inamide in the reverse direction. Thus, reduction of the protein with 1 eq of NADH followed by the addition of 1 eq of cob(III)alamin allowed the enzyme to undergo a single turnover. Analysis of the corresponding EPR spectrum revealed that the cob(III)alamin had been reduced to cob(II)alamin and an additional signal was present centered at g = 2.0032 consistent with the presence of a semiquinone radical. However, the yield of semiquinone was low, representing only a few percent of the total spin in the sample. The yield of semiquinone could be significantly increased to >50% by rapidly mixing reduced cooled enzyme with cob(III)alamin and quickly freezing the sample. Alternatively, cob(I)inamide could be used as a reductant to reduce the oxidized flavin. The addition of cob(I)inamide (which was generated by reduction of the Co(III) form with sodium borohydride) to a solution of CobR resulted in the oxidation of the cobalt to Co(II) and the formation of the flavin semiquinone. From such samples it was possible to record the EPR spectrum of the CobR-bound flavin semiquinone radical (Fig. 5a). Despite it not being possible to observe any resolved hyperfine structure from flavoprotein radicals, because of the multiplicity and anisotropies of the hyperfine interactions, it was possible to obtain some structural information from the line width of the EPR signal. An anionic, or red, semiquinone will typically exhibit a line width of ∼15 G, whereas a neutral, or blue, semiquinone is identified from a broader line width of around 19 G (23Palmer, G., Muller, F., and Massey, V. (1971) in Flavins and Flavoproteins (Kamin, H., ed) pp. 123-140, University Park Press, Baltimore, MDGoogle Scholar). With the line width of the CobR spectrum being 20.3 G, the signal has been assigned to that of a blue flavin semiquinone. The Davies ENDOR spectrum of the flavosemiquinone (Fig. 5, b and c) shows several features previously assigned in ENDOR spectra of neutral flavosemiquinones (24Kay C.W.M. Feicht R. Schulz K. Sadewater P. Sancar A. Bacher A. Mobius K. Richter G. Weber S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16740-16748Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 25Kurreck H. Bock M. Bretz N. Elsner M. Kraus H. Lubitz W. Muller F. Geissler J. Kroneck P.M.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 737-746Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 26Weilbacher E. Helle N. Elsner M. Kurreck H. Muller F. Allendoerfer R.D. Magn. Reson. Chem. 1988; 26: 64-72Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The most prominent features can be assigned to the A⊥ (b) and A∥ (d) components of the hyperfine coupling to the 8-methyl protons of the flavosemiquinone. Also evident are features, a, previously assigned to a component of the 6H hyperfine coupling. The use of a first derivative presentation allows for the observation of the lines c and e. These have previously been assigned as the A⊥ and A∥ components, respectively, of a hyperfine coupling to one of the C-1′-ribityl protons attached to the flavosemiquinone at N-10 (24Kay C.W.M. Feicht R. Schulz K. Sadewater P. Sancar A. Bacher A. Mobius K. Richter G. Weber S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16740-16748Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). There are many more features of the ENDOR spectrum lying between 12.5 and 17.5 MHz that could arise from either weak hyperfine coupling to flavosemiquinone protons or hyperfine coupling to protein protons. Further studies employing orientation selected ENDOR, H2O-D2O exchange, and specific deuteration of CobR will allow for the assignment of these lines. The hyperfine coupling to the 8-methyl protons is greater than that reported for many other protein-bound neutral flavosemiquinones or for the neutral flavosemiquinone in vitro being A⊥ = 8.0 Mhz and A∥ = 9.6 MHz. The isotropic hyperfine coupling of the 8-methyl protons, ⅓(2 A⊥ + A∥), is related to the unpaired electron spin density, ρ, at C-8 via the McConnell relation Aiso = QρC-8 (27McConnell H.M. J. Chem. Phys. 1956; 24: 764-766Crossref Scopus (490) Google Scholar), where the constant Q = 81. Thus the Aiso = 8.5 MHz, and ρC-8 is 0.104. This is somewhat higher than previously reported for many protein-bound flavosemiquinones and suggests that more of the unpaired electron spin density of the radical state is located at C-8 than in other flavoproteins. This may reflect the role of the dimethylbenzene part of the flavin, and the C-8 methyl group in particular, in electron transfer to Co(II)-corrinoids. Crystal Structure—Purified CobR was found to crystallize readily (Fig. S2). The crystal structure of CobR was solved de novo using single wavelength anomalous dispersion data and refined at 1.6 Å resolution to give a structure with good stereochemistry and with a Rwork and Rfree of 18.3 and 22.3%, respectively (see “Experimental Procedures”). Two CobR homodimers (four polypeptide chains) were present in the asymmetric unit, and within each homodimer the subunits are in close contact related by a pseudo 2-fold rotation axis. There was clear electron density for residues 8-173, 11-173, 12-173, and 13-173 for chains A, B, C, and D, respectively; the N-terminal part of the polypeptide chain is presumably rather flexible.

MRCK (myotonic dystrophy kinase-related Cdc42 binding kinase), a member of the dystrophia myotonica protein kinase family that functions downstream of Cdc42, contains a C1 domain with substantial homology to that of the diacylglycerol/phorbol ester-responsive C1 domains and has been reported to bind phorbol ester. We have characterized here the interaction of the C1 domains of the two MRCK isoforms α and β with phorbol ester. The MRCK C1 domains bind [20-3H]phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate with Kd values of 10 and 17 nm, respectively, reflecting 60–90-fold weaker affinity compared with the protein kinase C δ C1b domain. In contrast to binding by the C1b domain of PKCδ, the binding by the C1 domains of MRCK α and β was fully dependent on the presence of phosphatidylserine. Comparison of ligand binding selectivity showed resemblance to that by the C1b domain of PKCα and marked contrast to that of the C1b domain of PKCδ. In intact cells, as in the binding assays, the MRCK C1 domains required 50–100-fold higher concentrations of phorbol ester for induction of membrane translocation. We conclude that additional structural elements within the MRCK structure are necessary if the C1 domains of MRCK are to respond to phorbol ester at concentrations comparable with those that modulate PKC.

The C1 domains were first shown to be responsible for the recognition of DAG and phorbol ester by the classical and novel protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms. Subsequently, homologous domains have been identified in some 50 different mammalian proteins. Among these proteins, five families of proteins have been shown to have C1 domains that in fact bind phorbol esters and DAG (5Yang C. Kazanietz M.G. Trends Pharmacol.

J. Cell. Biochem. 2006; 97: 474-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Many other proteins have been described with C1 domains that do not appear to respond to phorbol ester or DAG. Structural analysis suggests that these non-responsive C1 domains can be divided into two groups. X-ray crystallographic and NMR analysis, together with molecular modeling, have provided a detailed understanding of the interaction of phorbol esters and DAG with C1 domains (15Zhang G. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Hurley J.H. Cell. 1995; 81: 917-924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). The phorbol ester binds in a hydrophilic cleft in an otherwise hydrophobic surface at the top of the C1 domain. By occupying this cleft, the phorbol ester both completes the hydrophobic surface and contributes further variable hydrophobic elements. The major class of phorbol ester non-responsive C1 domains, exemplified by that of Raf, shows modifications that disrupt this binding cleft. The C1 domains of the atypical PKCs, in contrast, appear to maintain the structure of the binding cleft but have introduced residues that destabilize membrane insertion and can interpose themselves in the binding cleft, competing for occupancy (16Pu Y.

In the present report, we wished to characterize the phorbol ester responsiveness of the C1 domains of MRCK α and β in more detail and to compare them with the C1b domain of PKCδ, which is perhaps the C1 domain whose interactions with phorbol ester have been evaluated most extensively. We confirm that the C1 domains of MRCK α and β recognize phorbol ester but their affinities both when reconstituted in phospholipid vesicles and in intact cells are substantially weaker than that of the C1b domain of PKCδ.

Rabbit polyclonal anti-PKCδ antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-mouse IgG was purchased from Bio-Rad. Construction of GST- and GFP-fused C1 Domains of MRCKα and MRCKβ—The C1 domains of MRCK α and β were generated by PCR using the Platinum® Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). The full-length cDNA clones of Homo sapiens myotonic dystrophy kinase-related CDC42-binding protein kinase α (DMPK-like) (MRCKα) and H. sapiens myotonic dystrophy kinase-related CDC42-binding protein kinase β (DMPK-like) (MRCKβ) were used as the templates. The following oligonucleotides were used as the PCR primers to pull out the targeted C1 domains: (i) forward and reverse primers for the C1 domain of MRCKα were 5′-CGG GAT CCA GCC TGG TTC AAC TGG CTT T-3′ and 5′-CGG TCG ACG TCA TGT TCC TAT TCC TTT CTG-3′ (3905–3953); (ii) forward and reverse primers for MRCKβ were 5′-AT G AA T TC AGG CCC TGG CTC TGG C-3′ and 5′-AT GTC GAC T GCA CGT CCA CGC CCA-3′ (3330–3561). The C1 domains of MRCK α and β were subcloned into the pGEX vector to produce GST fusion proteins in Escherichia coli strain BL21. To produce a construct suitable for mammalian expression and confocal studies, the cDNAs of the C1 domains of MRCK α and β were amplified by PCR and subcloned into the pEGFP vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). The DNA sequence of each construct was confirmed by sequencing analysis (DNA Minicore, Center for Cancer Research, NCI, National Institutes of Health). Expression in E. coli and Purification of the C1 Domains of MRCK α and β—The recombinant plasmids of the individual C1 domains of MRCK α and β were transformed into BL-21-Gold (DB3) E. coli strain BL21. The expression of the GST fusion proteins was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-O-d-thiogalactopyranoside that was added when the optical density of the Luria Bertani medium containing bacteria (Quality Biological, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) reached 0.5–0.7. The bacteria were harvested after 4 h of induction at 37 °C. The expressed GST-tagged C1 protein was purified using a B-PER GST spin purification kit (Pierce). The purified GST-C1 proteins were stored in 30% glycerol at -70 °C. Measurement of [3H]PDBu Binding—[3H]PDBu binding to the C1 domains of MRCKα/β and PKCα/δ was measured using the polyethylene glycol precipitation assay developed in our laboratory (19Lewin N.E. Blumberg P.M. Methods Mol. Biol. 2003; 233: 129-156PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, the assay mixture (250 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 100 μg/ml phosphatidylserine, 4 mg/ml bovine immunoglobulin G, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and various concentrations of [3H]PDBu was incubated at 18 °C for 10 min in 1.5-ml microfuge tubes. Samples were then chilled on ice for 7 min, 200 μl of 35% polyethylene glycol in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, was added, and the samples were mixed and incubated on ice for an additional 10 min. The tubes were then centrifuged in a Beckman Allegra 21R centrifuge at 4 °C (12,200 rpm, 15 min). A 100-μl aliquot of the supernatant from each tube was removed for determination of the free concentration of [3H]PDBu; the remaining supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was carefully dried. The tip of the centrifuge tube containing the pellet was cut off and transferred to a scintillation vial for the determination of the total bound [3H]PDBu. Radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 30 μm non-radioactive PDBu. Specific binding was calculated as the difference between total and nonspecific binding. To measure competition of [3H]PDBu binding by different compounds, assays were performed under similar conditions but using a fixed concentration of [3H]PDBu and increasing concentrations of the nonradioactive ligand. In a typical competition assay, six to eight different concentrations of the competing ligand were used. Standard Scatchard analysis was performed to determine the dissociation constants (Kd) of the individual C1 domains, and the inhibitory dissociation constants (Ki) were calculated using our standard method as described previously (19Lewin N.E. Blumberg P.M. Methods Mol. Biol. 2003; 233: 129-156PubMed Google Scholar). Binding data of 1,2-dioctanoyl glycerol to the C1 domain of PKCα were analyzed by the modified Hill equation. Values of specific binding were determined in triplicate at each ligand concentration in each experiment. All binding experiments were performed at least three times unless otherwise specified. Expression and Imaging of GFP-tagged C1 Domains in Living Cells—LNCaP cells (obtained from ATCC, Manassas, VA) were cultured at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (0.05 mg/ml) in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. The plasmid DNAs of the GFP-fused individual C1 domain of MRCKα and the C1b domain of PKCδ were transfected into LNCaP cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The translocation of C1 domains was determined 24 h after transfection. Cells were examined with a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss Inc., Thornwood, NY) with an Axiovert 100 M inverted microscope operating with a 25-milliwatt argon laser tuned to 488 nm. Cells were imaged with a 63 × 1.4 NA Zeiss Plan-Apochromat oil immersion objective and with varying zooms (1.4–2). Time lapse images were collected before and after administration of PMA every 30 s using the Zeiss AIM software, in which the green emission was collected in a photomultiplier with an LP 505 filter. Preparation of Cell Fractions and Immunoblot Analysis of Membrane Translocation of the C1 Domain of MRCKα and the C1b Domain of PKCδ in LNCaP Cells—LNCaP cells (obtained from ATCC) were seeded in 60-mm Petri dishes. 24 h after transfection with the C1 domain of MRCKα or the C1b domain of PKCδ, the cells were treated with PMA (0.001–30 μm) for 30 min. The cells were washed with ice-cold Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (KD Medical, Inc., Columbia, MD) and then harvested with 120 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, plus protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Cells were frozen for 1 min in a dry ice-ethanol mixture and subsequently thawed for 1 min in a 37 °C water bath; the process was repeated eight times. 100 μl of the cell lysate was transferred to a Beckman ultracentrifuge tube and centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 2 h to separate the cytosolic and membrane fractions; the remaining 20 μl was used as the total cell fraction. After ultracentrifugation, the supernatant was designated as the cytosolic fraction. The pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, protease inhibitor mixture, and 1% Nonidet P-40) (Calbiochem) and incubated on ice for 1 h. This mixture was again subjected to centrifugation (100,000 × g for 1 h). This supernatant was designated as the membrane fraction. Each sample were diluted in 2× SDS buffer and boiled 10 min on 100 °C. An equal volume of sample (18 μl) for each fraction was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. After the membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h, the blots were probed with anti-GFP monoclonal antibody (Roche Applied Science) and the appropriate secondary antibody. The signal was developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (Amersham Biosciences) and imaged on BioMax MAX films (Kodak). Bands were quantified densitometrically using ImageJ software (NIH Image). In a typical membrane translocation assay, ten concentrations of ligand were used. Binding of Phorbol Esters to the Recombinant C1 Domains of MRCKα and MRCKβ—The structures of MRCK α and β (20Garcia P. Ucurum Z. Bucher R. Svergun D.I. Huber T. Lustig A. Konarev P.V. Marino M. Mayans O. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 1142-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) are shown schematically in Fig. 1A. Both MRCK isoforms contain C1 domains that show high sequence homology with phorbol ester binding C1 domains in PKC isoforms (Fig. 1B), and indeed the C1 domain of MRCKα was shown directly to bind phorbol ester although it was not further evaluated (18Tan I. Seow K.T. Lim L. Leung T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2767-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We wished to determine the binding characteristics of the C1 domains of these proteins for direct comparison with the well characterized domains of protein kinase C isoforms. The isolated C1 domains of MRCK α and β were expressed as GST fusion proteins in E. coli and partially purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” [3H]PDBu binding was measured in the presence of 100 μg/ml of phosphatidylserine. As is the case for the C1 domains of protein kinase C, [3H]PDBu (20 nm) bound rapidly to the C1 domains of MRCK α and β;a maximal level of binding was obtained between 10 and 15 min (data not shown) at 18 °C and slowly decreased thereafter. A similar level of binding was observed at 0 °C (a single experiment), whereas binding at 37 °C was substantially less. For subsequent analysis, we therefore used a 10-min incubation time at 18 °C. Under these conditions, Scatchard analysis revealed that C1 domains of MRCK α and β bound [3H]PDBu with dissociation constants (Kd values) of 10.3 ± 2.0 and 17 ± 1.2 nm, respectively (mean ± S.E., n = 3 experiments), in the presence of 0.1 mm CaCl2. These values were 58- and 96-fold weaker than that for the C1b domain of PKCδ (Kd = 0.18 ± 0.004 nm) and 3- and 5-fold weaker than for the C1b domain of PKCα (Kd = 3.4 ± 0.12 nm) (mean ± S.E., n = 3, experiments performed in parallel for the C1 domains of PKCδ, MRCKα, and MRCKβ) (Table 1; supplemental Fig. S1). These results confirm that the C1 domains are able to bind phorbol ester but suggest that the binding affinities, at least of the isolated C1 domains, are appreciably weaker than those of the C1b domain of PKC δ or α.TABLE 1Structure-activity analysis of binding to the C1 domain of MRCK α/β, PKCα C1b, and PKCδ C1b The Kd values for PDBu binding were measured directly with [3H]PDBu.

Open table in a new tab PDBu Binding to the C1 Domains of MRCKα and MRCKβ as a Function of Phosphatidylserine Concentration and the Total Amount of Phospholipids—Acidic phospholipids are essential cofactors for the activation of PKC (21Takai Y. Kishimoto A. Iwasa Y. Kawahara Y. Mori T. Nishizuka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3692-3695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with phosphatidylserine being the most effective phospholipid for supporting phorbol ester/DAG binding to PKC, n-chimerin, and Unc-13 (22Areces L.B.

Biochem. 1985; 29: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Because of the relatively low affinity binding of [3H]PDBu to the C1 domains of MRCK α and β, we wished to determine whether some lipid conditions other than those selected would lead to enhanced affinities. In the first series of experiments, we determined the specific binding of [3H]PDBu to the MRCKα C1 domain as a function of total phospholipid at various fixed proportions of phosphatidylserine (Fig. 2A). Under all conditions, the [3H]PDBu binding was dependent on the presence of phospholipid. It also showed a marked dependence on phosphatidylserine and, at high proportions of phosphatidylserine, showed inhibition at excess amounts of total lipid. Under our standard conditions of 100% phosphatidylserine, the level of binding was optimal at 100 μg/ml phospholipid and decreased at higher concentrations. In contrast, at 20% phosphatidylserine maximal binding was only achieved at 1000 μg/ml total lipid. A similar pattern was observed when the proportion of phosphatidylserine was varied at various fixed amounts of total phospholipid (Fig. 2B). At 100 μg/ml of total phospholipid, maximal binding was seen at 75% or more phosphatidylserine. In contrast, at 1000 μg/ml total phospholipid, optimal [3H]PDBu binding was observed at 25% phosphatidylserine, with decreasing binding at either higher or lower proportions. In single experiments, we obtained similar results for the C1 domain of MRCKβ, both for the optimal amount of total phospholipid at 20 and 80% phosphatidylserine and for the optimal % phosphatidylserine at 300 and 1000 μg/ml total phospholipid. We conclude that the requirements of the C1 domains of MRCK for phosphatidylserine are appreciably higher than that of the PKCδ C1b domain, which retains 50% of maximal binding in the absence of phosphatidylserine at 100 μg/ml total phospholipid (16Pu Y.

Furthermore, our binding conditions appear appropriate and do not readily explain the relatively low affinity observed for the C1 domains of MRCK α and β. Structure Activity Analysis of Binding to the C1 Domain of MRCKα/β—Different C1 domains show different patterns of ligand recognition (25Irie K. Masuda A. Shindo M. Nakagawa Y. Ohigashi H. Bioorg.

For comparison of the ligand selectivity of the C1 domains of MRCK α and β with that of other C1 domains, we performed competition binding studies using several structurally diverse, high affinity ligands for other C1 domains (Table 1). Competition experiments with the DAG lactone HK-434 (27Garcia-Bermejo M.L. Leskow F.C. Fujii T. Wang Q. Blumberg P.M. Ohba M. Kuroki T. Han K.C. Lee J. Marquez V.E. Kazanietz M.G. J. Biol.

The results for 1,2-dioctanoyl glycerol, for the DAG lactone 130C045 (26Pu Y. Perry N.A. Yang D. Lewin N.E. Kedei N. Braun D.C. Choi S.H. Blumberg P.M. Garfield S.H. Stone J.C. Duan D. Marquez V.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27329-27338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and for sapintoxin D revealed a similar pattern. Both the C1 domains of MRCK α and β and the C1b domain of PKCα bound 1,2-dioctanoyl glycerol with 400–1000-fold weaker affinity than did the C1b domain of PKCδ. Of incidental note, the measurement of the binding affinity of 1,2-dioctanoyl glycerol to the C1b domain of PKCα should be considered approximate because of non-theoretical behavior, probably reflecting a secondary effect of enhanced PDBu affinity as 1,2-dioctanoyl glycerol partitions into the phosphatidylserine in the assay. The C1 domain of MRCK α and β displayed 15,000-fold weaker binding of 130C045 than did the C1 domain of PKCδ, compared with only 5–6-fold weaker binding relative to the C1b domain of PKCα. For sapintoxin D, the C1 domains of MRCK α and β indeed bound with modestly higher affinity than did the C1b domain of PKCα, whereas once again the C1b domain of PKCδ bound with 40–90-fold stronger affinity. We conclude that the C1 domains of MRCK α and β show ligand selectivity similar to the C1b domain of PKCα, at least for this series of ligands. Relative to the C1b domain of PKCδ, the C1 domains of MRCK α and β bind the other ligands examined not appreciably better than they do PDBu, and they bind diacylglycerol, the physiological ligand, markedly more poorly. Comparison of Translocation to the Membrane of the C1 Domain of MRCKα and the C1b Domain of PKCδ in Response to PMA—We were concerned that the apparent weak affinity of the C1 domain of MRCKα for phorbol ester might reflect an inappropriate environment under our assay conditions, despite our efforts to optimize the lipid conditions. We therefore examined the ability of the C1 domain of MRCKα to undergo translocation from the cytosol to the membrane as a function of phorbol ester concentration and compared its sensitivity with that of the C1b domain of PKCδ. We prepared the C1 domain of MRCKα as a fusion construct with GPF and expressed it in the LNCaP human cell line. The transfected LNCaP cells were treated with various doses of PMA (0.001–30 μm) for 30 min, after which the cells were harvested, membrane and cytoplasmic fractions were prepared, and the distribution of the C1 domain of MRCKα between cytosolic and membrane fractions was determined by Western blotting using anti-GFP antibody (Fig. 3A). Translocation required 1–30 μm PMA, in contrast to a concentration of 0.01–0.03 μm PMA for the C1b domain of PKCδ (Fig. 3B). We conclude that, in intact cells as in the in vitro binding assays, the response of the C1 domain of MRCKα was ∼100–1000-fold weaker than that of the C1b domain of PKCδ. Comparison of the Redistribution of the C1 Domain of MRCKα and the C1b Domain of PKCδ in LNCaP Cells after Phorbol Ester Treatment—Using the GFP fusion protein with the C1 domain of MRCKα, we also examined its subcellular distribution in living LNCaP cells as a function of time after treatment with various doses of PMA and compared its response with that of the C1b domain of PKCδ. The cells were maintained at room temperature and imaged with a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope. Under control conditions, most of the C1 domain of MRCKα was present in the cytoplasm of the cells with lower amounts in the nucleus and perhaps a small amount associated with the plasma membrane (Fig. 4A). Addition of PMA led to a slow, concentration-dependent shift in the distribution of the MRCK C1 domain. Translocation only began to be observed at concentrations of PMA of 0.5 μm and higher. Translocation was to the plasma membrane, with loss of MRCK C1 domain from the nucleus also being evident. In contrast, the C1b domain of PKCδ showed slow translocation at 0.01 μm PMA and a more rapid response at higher concentrations of PMA (Fig. 4B). We conclude that the C1 domain of MRCKα was ∼50–100-fold less responsive to PMA under these conditions in living cells. Similar results were obtained with measurements conducted at 37 °C (data not shown). Our analysis confirms the findings of Tan et al. (18Tan I. Seow K.T. Lim L. Leung T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2767-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) that MRCK α and β represent the seventh class of proteins with phorbol ester-responsive C1 domains, along with PKC, protein kinase D, the chimerins, RasGRP, munc-13, and the DAG kinases. MRCK thus provides yet another divergent pathway for phorbol ester action. The interactions of phorbol esters with the pathways involving the small GTPases are extensive. The chimerins function as GTPase-activating proteins for Rac, reducing Rac activity. The RasGRP proteins function as GTP exchange factors for Ras and Rap, enhancing their activity. PKC activates RasGRP1/3 by phosphorylation and has additional effects downstream of Ras. Finally, the MRCK proteins function downstream of Cdc42. One of the very early observations about the response of cultured cells to phorbol esters was their dramatic effect on cellular morphology (28Driedger P.E. Blumberg P.M. Cancer Res. 1977; 37: 3257-3265PubMed Google Scholar). The identification of the multiple targets of phorbol ester action involved in aspects of morphology emphasizes the complexity underlying this observation. The C1 domains of MRCK α and β provide further examples of the diversity of behavior within C1 domains. The differences for the binding affinity of PDBu are in general larger than those reported by Irie et al. (25Irie K. Masuda A. Shindo M. Nakagawa Y. Ohigashi H. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2004; 12: 4575-4583Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) among the C1 domains from previously characterized families of phorbol ester receptors. As observed by us and others, different C1 domains differ in their ligand selectivities (25Irie K. Masuda A. Shindo M. Nakagawa Y. Ohigashi H. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2004; 12: 4575-4583Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 26Pu Y. Perry N.A. Yang D. Lewin N.E. Kedei N. Braun D.C. Choi S.H. Blumberg P.M. Garfield S.H. Stone J.C. Duan D. Marquez V.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27329-27338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Thus, for example, 130C037 has a Kd of 1.8 nm for the C1b domain of PKCδ and a value of >10 μm for that of PKCα. Likewise, depending on the ligand, the difference in selectivity between the C1 domain of MRCKα and the C1b domain of PKCδ ranged from 42-fold for sapintoxin D to 15000-fold for 130C045. These results argue that it is not simply that the MRCK C1 domains have low affinity for ligands but rather that they show altered structure activity relations. The context in which the C1 domains are present plays an important role in their function. Canacarajah et al. (29Canacarajah B. Leskow F.C. Ho J.Y. Mischak H. Saidi L.F. Kazanietz M.G. Hurley J.H. Cell. 2004; 119: 407-418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) have elegantly demonstrated with β2-chimerin that the C1 domain is shielded by other residues in the intact protein and that unfolding of the protein markedly enhances the potency of phorbol ester for inducing translocation. Less direct studies suggest a similar situation for the PKCs (30Oancea E. Meyer T. Cell. 1998; 95: 307-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). For the PKCs, a mechanistic basis for such effects is the presence of other membrane- or ligand-interacting domains, for example the C2 domains of the classical PKCs that contribute, along with phorbol ester binding to the C1 domain, to the overall energetics of membrane association (31Newton A.C. Johnson J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 155-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Thus, whereas the C1b domain of PKCδ binds the selective constrained DAG lactone 130C037 with 300-fold higher affinity than does either of the two isolated C1 domains of PKCα, the intact PKCδ binds 130C037 with only 4-fold stronger affinity than does intact PKCα (26Pu Y. Perry N.A. Yang D. Lewin N.E. Kedei N. Braun D.C. Choi S.H. Blumberg P.M. Garfield S.H. Stone J.C. Duan D. Marquez V.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27329-27338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Our present results with MRCK argue that other structural elements will be needed to drive a robust response to phorbol ester or diacylglycerol. Download .pdf (.3 MB) Help with pdf files"
https://openalex.org/W2089409909,"The Ewing's sarcoma family of tumors (ESFT) includes Ewing's sarcoma (ES), Askin's tumor of the chest wall, and peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor. Basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF2) suppresses the growth of ESFT cells and causes their apoptosis. The underlying mechanism is unclear. Using a human peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor cell line, SK-N-MC, we demonstrated FGF2 stimulated phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2 (pERK1/2) and GSK3beta (pGSK3beta(Tyr-216)), all of which were primarily retained in the cytoplasm. FGF2 promoted the association between ERK and pGSK3beta(Tyr-216). Inhibitors for GSK3beta (TDZD and LiCl) and ERK (PD98059) protected cells from FGF2-induced apoptosis. On the other hand, inhibitors of GSK3beta, but not PD98059 decreased ERK/pGSK3beta(Tyr-216) association and caused a nuclear translocation of pERK1/2. Similarly, expression of a kinase-deficient (K85R) GSK3beta or GSK3beta-small interfering RNA inhibited FGF2-regulated ERK/pGSK3beta(Tyr-216) association and translocated pERK to the nucleus. Both K85R GSK3beta and small interfering RNA offered protection against FGF2-induced cell death. In contrast, overexpression of wild-type GSK3beta sensitized cells to FGF2 cytotoxicity. Hydrogen peroxide and ethanol enhanced FGF2-stimulated pGSK3beta(Tyr-216), ERK/pGSK3beta(Tyr-216) association, and cytoplasmic retention of pERK1/2. As a result, they potentiated FGF2-induced cell death. Taken together, our results suggested that FGF2-induced accumulation of pERK1/2 in the cytoplasm is toxic for SK-N-MC cells. The formation of an ERK.GSK3beta complex retained pERK1/2 in the cytoplasm. In contrast, disruption of the ERK.GSK3beta complex resulted in nuclear translocation of pERK1/2 and offered protection."

Apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1) plays a central role in the repair of AP sites via the base excision repair pathway. Here we found that Bcl2 down-regulates APE1 endonuclease activity in association with inhibition of AP site repair. Exposure of cells to nitrosamine 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone results in accumulation of Bcl2 in the nucleus and interaction with APE1, which requires all of the BH domains of Bcl2. Deletion of any of the BH domains from Bcl2 abrogates the ability of Bcl2 to interact with APE1 as well as the inhibitory effects of Bcl2 on APE1 activity and AP site repair. Overexpression of Bcl2 in cells reduces formation of the APE1·XRCC1 complex, and purified Bcl2 protein directly disrupts the APE1·XRCC1 complex with suppression of APE1 endonuclease activity in vitro. Importantly, specific knockdown of endogenous Bcl2 by RNA interference enhances APE1 endonuclease activity with accelerated AP site repair. Thus, Bcl2 inhibition of AP site repair may occur in a novel mechanism by down-regulating APE1 endonuclease activity, which may promote genetic instability and tumorigenesis.

AP sites can result from spontaneous and chemically initiated hydrolysis through various conditions, including ionizing radiation, UV irradiation, oxidative stress, and exposure to cigarette smoking (1Kelley M.

Human apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1) is a major constituent of the base excision repair (BER) pathway of AP sites of DNA lesions (3Tell G. Damante G. Caldwell D. Kelley M. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2005; 7: 367-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Additionally, APE1 is also named as redox effector factor-1 (1Kelley M. Parsons S. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2001; 3: 671-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) because of its redox abilities on different redox-regulated transcription factors (3Tell G. Damante G. Caldwell D. Kelley M. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2005; 7: 367-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 5Xanthoudakis S. Miao G. Curran T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Two activities of this molecule are split into two functionally independent domains of the protein itself: the N terminus is principally devoted to the redox activity, whereas the C terminus exerts enzymatic activity on the repair of AP sites of DNA lesions (3Tell G. Damante G. Caldwell D. Kelley M. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2005; 7: 367-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 5Xanthoudakis S. Miao G. Curran T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). APE1 specifically binds to abasic sites and cuts the 5′ phosphodiester bond with its endonuclease activity to produce a DNA primer with 3′ hydroxyl end, which is a required step in the BER repair pathway (3Tell G. Damante G. Caldwell D. Kelley M. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2005; 7: 367-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Therefore, APE1 is an essential endonuclease and plays a central role in the repair of AP sites of DNA lesions. apurinic/apyrimidinic or abasic site apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 nitrosamine 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1y-butanone base excision repair Bcl2 homology small interfering RNA wild type phosphate-buffered saline 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid aldehyde reactive probe. Bcl2, a major cellular oncogenic protein, plays pivotal roles in enhancing cell survival, retarding G1/S cell cycle transition, and attenuating DNA repair (4Jin Z. May W.S. Gao F. Flagg T. Deng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14446-14456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 6Deng X. Gao F. Flagg T. Anderson J. May W.S. Mol. Cell.

Because overexpression of Bcl2 results in lymphomagenesis in transgenic mice, this suggests that Bcl2, in addition to its survival activity, may also potentially have an oncogenic property (8Linette G.P. Hess J.L. Sentman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Blood. 1995; 86: 1255-1260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanism(s) by which Bcl2 facilitates oncogenesis is not fully understood. The oncogenic effect of Bcl2 may result from its multiple cellular properties. Bcl2 was originally discovered as a gene product at the chromosomal breakpoint of t(14;18) (9Tsujimoto Y. Cossman J. Jaffe E. Croce C.M. Science. 1985; 229: 1390-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar), which may play a role in genetic instability and tumor development by impeding DNA repair. It has been reported that Bcl2 can enhance benzene metabolite-induced DNA damage and mutagenesis in human promyelocytic HL60 cells (10Kuo M. Shiah S. Wang C. Chuang S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 894-901PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of Bcl2 not only attenuates the nucleotide excision repair capacity and DNA replication in UV-irradiated HL60 cells (11Liu Y. Naumovski L. Hanawalt P. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1650-1653PubMed Google Scholar) but also inhibits γ-ray-induced homologous recombination repair pathways (12Saintigny Y. Dumay A. Lambert S. Lopez B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2596-2607Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Bcl2 can also suppress DNA mismatch repair by inhibiting E2F transcriptional activity (13Youn C.K. Cho H. Kim S. Kim H. Kim M. Chang I. Lee J. Chung M. Hahm K. You H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 137-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, our recent findings reveal that Bcl2 suppression of DNA mismatch repair occur in a mechanism by directly regulating the heterodimeric hMSH2·hMSH6 complex, which leads to enhanced mutagenesis (14Hou Y. Gao F. Wang Q. Zhao J. Flagg T. Zhang Y. Deng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9279-9287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thus, the oncogenic activity of Bcl2 may result from its inhibitory effects on multiple DNA repair pathways. Nitrosamine 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) is the most potent carcinogen contained in cigarette smoke that can induce cellular DNA damage including AP sites of DNA lesions (4Jin Z.

NNK-induced AP sites of DNA lesions, if unrepaired or repaired incorrectly, could be mutagenic, which may lead to mutations and chromosomal breaks with malignant transformation. We previously discovered that Bcl2 potently suppresses the repair of NNK-induced abasic sites of DNA lesions (4Jin Z. May W.S. Gao F. Flagg T. Deng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14446-14456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism(s) is not fully understood. Here we found that Bcl2 not only directly interacts with APE1 but also inhibits its endonuclease activity, which leads to suppression of AP site repair. Materials—Bcl2, APE1, XRCC1, and tubulin antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). NNK was purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals (Toronto, Canada). Purified recombinant WT, ΔBH1, ΔBH2, ΔBH3, and ΔBH4 Bcl2 mutant proteins were obtained from ProteinX Lab (San Diego, CA). Purified recombinant APE1 protein was purchased from Abnova Corporation (Taipei, Taiwan). Synthetic human Bcl2 siRNA (sense strand sequence, GGAUCCAGGAUAACGGAGGTT) was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. All of the reagents used were obtained from commercial sources unless otherwise stated. Generation of Various Bcl2 Deletion Mutants—To create ΔBH1, ΔBH2, ΔBH3, and ΔBH4 Bcl2 deletion mutants, the 5′ phosphorylated mutagenic primers for various precise deletion mutants were synthesized as follow: ΔBH1, 5′-GGA CGC TTT GCC ACG GTG GTG GAG GTG GAG AGC GTC AAC AGG GAG ATG-3′; ΔBH2, 5′-GAG TAC CTG AAC CGG CAT CTG CAC CGA CCT CTG TTT GAT TTC TCC TGG-3′; ΔBH3, 5′-GCG CTC AGC CCT GTG CCA CCT GTG GAC TTC GCA GAG ATG TCC AGT CAG-3′; ΔBH4, 5′-GGA AGG ATG GCG CAA GCC GGG AGA GCT GGA GAT GCG GAC GCG GCG CCC CTG-3′. The WT-Bcl2/pUC19 construct was used as the target plasmid that contains a unique NdeI restriction site for selection against the unmutated plasmid. The NdeI selection primer is: 5′-GAG TGC ACC ATG GGC GGT GTG AAA-3′. Various Bcl2 BH deletion mutants were created by using a mutagenesis kit (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions and confirmed by sequencing of the cDNA. The WT and various Bcl2 deletion mutants were then cloned into the pCIneo (Promega) mammalian expression vector. Cell Lines, Plasmids, and Transfections—Various human lung cancer cells were maintained as previously described (4Jin Z. May W.S. Gao F. Flagg T. Deng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14446-14456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The pCIneo plasmid containing each Bcl2 mutant cDNA was transfected into H1299 cells using LipfectAMINE™2000 (Invitrogen). Clones stably expressing WT or each of the Bcl2 deletion mutants were selected in a medium containing G418 (0.6 mg/ml). The expression levels of exogenous Bcl2 were analyzed by Western blot analysis. Three separate clones for each mutant expressing similar amounts of exogenous Bcl2 were selected for further analysis. Preparation of Cell Lysates—Cells were washed with 1× PBS and resuspended in ice-cold 1% CHAPS lysis buffer (1% CHAPS, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol) with a mixture of protease inhibitors (Calbiochem). The cells were lysed by sonication and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was collected as the total cell lysate and used for protein analysis or co-immunoprecipitation as described (6Deng X. Gao F. Flagg T. Anderson J. May W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 4421-4434Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Subcellular Fractionation—Subcellular fractionation was performed as described previously (4Jin Z. May W.S. Gao F. Flagg T. Deng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14446-14456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells (2 × 107) were washed once with cold 1× PBS and resuspended in isotonic mitochondrial buffer (210 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5) containing protease inhibitor mixture set I (Calbiochem). The resuspended cells were homogenized with a polytron homogenizer operating for four bursts of 10 s each at a setting of 5 and then centrifuged at 2000 × g for 3 min to pellet the nuclei and unbroken cells. The supernatant was centrifuged at 13,000 ×g for 10 min to pellet mitochondria. The mitochondria was washed with mitochondrial buffer, resuspended with 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, rocked for 60 min, and then centrifuged at 17,530 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant containing mitochondrial proteins was collected. For nuclear fractionation, the cells were washed with 1× PBS and suspended in 2 ml of Buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.03% Nonidet P-40 with fresh protease inhibitor mixture set I). The samples were incubated on ice until more than 95% of cells could be stained by trypan blue. The samples were then centrifuged at 500 × g at 4 °C for 5 min. The resulting nuclear pellet was washed with Buffer B (50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 25% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm spermidine, 0.15 mm spermine) and then resuspended in 150 μl of Buffer C (350 mm NaCl, 10 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 25% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm spermidine, 0.15 mm spermine) and rocked at 4 °C for 30 min. After centrifugation (14, 000 × g) at 4 °C, the supernatant (nuclear fraction) was collected. Protein (100 μg) from each fraction was subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting using a Bcl2 antibody. Immunofluorescence Staining—The cell were washed with 1× PBS, fixed with cold methanol and acetone (1:1) for 5 min, and then blocked with 10% normal rabbit serum for 20 min at room temperature. The cells were incubated with a rabbit Bcl2 primary antibody for 90 min. After washing, the samples were incubated with Alexa 594 (red)-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies for 60 min. The cells were washed with 1× PBS and observed under a fluorescent microscope (Zeiss). Pictures were taken of each sample. AP Oligonucleotide Assay for APE1 Endonuclease Activity—A 26-mer oligonucleotide (IDT Technologies, Coralville, IA) containing a tetrahydrofuran (F) residue at position 15 was used as the APE1 substrate as described (1Kelley M. Parsons S. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2001; 3: 671-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 2Lau J. Weatherdon K. Skalski V. Hedley D. Br. J. Cancer. 2004; 91: 1166-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Following 32P labeling, the oligonucleotides were purified using a G25 column and then annealed to a complementary oligonucleotide. Assays using nuclear extract isolated from cells or purified APE1 protein were performed in a 20-μl reaction volume containing 2.5 pmol of labeled double-stranded F oligonucleotide, in 50 mm Hepes, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Triton X-100, pH 7.5. The reactions were allowed to proceed for 15 min in a 37 °C water bath and stopped by adding an equal volume of 96% formamide, 10 mm EDTA, and bromphenol blue. 10 μl of this 40-μl sample was separated with a 20% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea. APE1 endonuclease activity was analyzed by autoradiography. AP Site Counting in Genomic DNA—Genomic DNA was purified using a DNA isolation kit (Dojindo Molecular Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). The number of AP sites was assessed using a DNA damage quantification (AP site counting) kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Dojindo Molecular Technologies, Inc.). Aldehyde reactive probe (ARP) reagent (N′-aminooxymethylcarbonylhydrazino-d-biotin) can react specifically with an aldehyde group that is the open ring form of the AP sites. After treating DNA containing AP sites with ARP reagent, AP sites are tagged with biotin residues. By using an excess amount of ARP, all AP sites can be converted to biotin-tagged AP sites. Standard ARP DNA and purified ARP-labeled sample genomic DNA was fixed on a 96-well plate with DNA binding solution. Then the number of AP sites in the sample DNA was determined by the biotin-avidin-peroxidase assay. The absorbance of the samples was analyzed using a microplate reader with a 650-nm filter. Each experiment was repeated three times, and the data represent the means ± S.D. of three determinations. Bcl2 Silence—This is a technique for down-regulating the expression of a specific gene in living cells by introducing a short homologous double-stranded RNA. H460 cells expressing high levels of endogenous Bcl2 were transfected with Bcl2 siRNA (10 nm) using LipofectAMINE™ 2000. A control siRNA (nonhomologous to any known gene sequence) was used as a negative control. The levels of Bcl2 expression were analyzed by Western blotting. Specific silencing of the targeted Bcl2 gene was confirmed by at least three independent experiments. Expression of Endogenous Bcl2 Is Associated with Decreased APE1 Endonuclease Activity in Various Human Lung Cancer Cells—APE1 is a multifunctional DNA repair enzyme that mainly functions as an abasic endonuclease in the BER pathway (1Kelley M. Parsons S. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2001; 3: 671-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 2Lau J. Weatherdon K. Skalski V. Hedley D. Br. J. Cancer. 2004; 91: 1166-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 3Tell G. Damante G. Caldwell D. Kelley M. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2005; 7: 367-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, APE1 is widely expressed in both small cell lung cancer and nonsmall cell lung cancer cells (Fig. 1A), suggesting that APE1 may play a role in regulating DNA repair in human lung cancer cells. Bcl2, a major antiapoptotic and/or oncogenic protein, is found to co-express with APE1 in H69 and H460 but not in other lung cancer cells tested (Fig. 1A). We previously discovered that Bcl2 can suppress the repair of abasic sites of DNA lesions (4Jin Z. May W.S. Gao F. Flagg T. Deng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14446-14456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism(s) remains enigmatic. To test whether endogenous expression of Bcl2 may potentially regulate APE1 function, AP endonuclease activity was measured in various lung cancer cells. A 26-mer 32P-labeled, AP site mimetic, double-stranded F oligonucleotide was used as an APE1 substrate as described (1Kelley M. Parsons S. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2001; 3: 671-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 2Lau J. Weatherdon K. Skalski V. Hedley D. Br. J. Cancer. 2004; 91: 1166-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1B, the cleaved product should be observed as a 14-mer fragment that will indicate the AP endonuclease repair activity. By contrast, the uncleaved oligonucleotide correlating to no activity should be observed as a 26-mer fragment. Thus, the AP endonuclease activity was determined by the amount of cleaved product (14-mer). 32P-labeled 26-mer AP site mimetic oligonucleotides were incubated with nuclear extract isolated from various human lung cancer cells. Decreased levels of AP endonuclease activity (i.e. smaller amount of cleaved 14-mer products and greater amount of uncleaved 26-mer oligonucleotides) were observed in both H460 and H69 cells that express high levels of endogenous Bcl2 as compared with the other cell lines that express undetectable levels of Bcl2 (Fig. 1C), suggesting that Bcl2 may play a negative role in regulating APE1 endonuclease activity. Overexpression of Exogenous Bcl2 Down-regulates APE1 Activity and Potently Suppresses AP Site Repair—To directly test effects of Bcl2 on APE1 function and AP site repair, Bcl2 was stably overexpressed in H1299 cells that do not express detectable levels of endogenous Bcl2. A majority of the 26-mer oligonucleotides was cleaved into 14-mer products after incubation with the nuclear extract isolated from vector-only control cells, indicating a strong AP endonuclease activity in vector-only H1299 cells (Fig. 2, A and B). In contrast, overexpression of Bcl2 prevents the 26-mer oligonucleotides from cleavage (Fig. 2, A and B). These findings suggest that Bcl2 suppresses APE1 endonuclease activity. Similar results were obtained from three independent clones expressing similar levels of exogenous Bcl2, indicating that these findings are reliable. Because APE1 endonuclease activity is essential for AP site repair, Bcl2-mediated inhibition of APE1 endonuclease activity may suppress AP site repair. To test this possibility, Bcl2-overexpressing H1299 cells or vector-only control cells were treated with NNK for 60 min. The cells were then washed and incubated with normal cell culture medium for various times up to 72 h. AP sites of DNA lesions in genomic DNA were assessed using a DNA damage quantification (AP site counting) kit and analyzed using a microplate reader with a 650-nm filter as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results reveal that NNK significantly enhances the AP sites of DNA lesions in both WT Bcl2-expressing and vector-only control cells within 60 min (Fig. 2C). After removal of NNK from the culture medium, AP sites of DNA lesions in vector-only control cells are significantly reduced within 24 h, indicating that most AP sites are repaired in vector-only control cells (Fig. 2C). By contrast, increased AP sites of DNA lesions are observed in Bcl2-overexpressing cells as compared with vector-only control cells after 24 h (Fig. 2C), suggesting that overexpression of Bcl2 potently inhibits the repair of NNK-induced AP sites of DNA lesions. Similar results were obtained from three independent clones expressing similar levels of exogenous Bcl2 (Fig. 2C). To test whether purified APE1 protein can restore the endonuclease activity in Bcl2 expressing extracts, increasing concentrations (i.e. 0.5–2.0 ng/ml) of purified APE1 protein were added to the nuclear extract(s) isolated from Bcl2-overexpressing H1299 cells in assay buffer. The results reveal that the addition of purified APE1 results in a dose-dependent increase in the production of the cleaved fragments (i.e. 14-mer) with a gradual decrease of the uncleaved 26-mer oligonucleotides (Fig. 2D), indicating that the addition of active APE1 is able to restore the endonuclease activity in Bcl2-expressing extracts. Exposure of Cells to the DNA-damaging Agent NNK Promotes Bcl2 Accumulation and Association with APE1 in Nucleus—Bcl2 is primarily localized in the outer mitochondrial membranes with minor expression in nuclear and endoplasmic reticulum membrane systems (17Hockenbery D. Nunez G. Milliman C. Schreiber R. Korsmeyer S. Nature. 1990; 348: 334-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (3544) Google Scholar, 18Zhu W. Cowie A. Wasfy G. Penn L.Z. Leber B. Andrews D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4130-4141Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Recent reports indicate that Bcl2 also resides in the nucleoplasm and functions within the nucleus (4Jin Z. May W.S. Gao F. Flagg T. Deng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14446-14456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 19Hoetelmans R. van Slooten H. Keijzer R. Erkeland S. van de Velde C. Dierendonck J. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 384-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 20Schardle C. Li S. Re G. Fan W. Willinghamm M. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1999; 47: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that the nuclear-localized Bcl2 has no antiapoptotic activity but is able to suppress DNA repair (4Jin Z. May W.S. Gao F. Flagg T. Deng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14446-14456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To test how Bcl2 regulates APE1 following DNA damage, H460 cells expressing high levels of endogenous Bcl2 and APE1 were exposed to NNK (5 μm) for 60 min. Subcellular distribution of Bcl2 was then examined by immunofluorescent staining. Consistent with our previous findings (4Jin Z. May W.S. Gao F. Flagg T. Deng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14446-14456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), the majority of Bcl2 is localized in cytoplasm, and only a small proportion is located in the nucleus in untreated cells. Intriguingly, Bcl2 is accumulated in nucleus after exposure of cells to NNK for 60 min (Fig. 3A). To further confirm this, subcellular fractionation was carried out to isolate mitochondrial and nuclear fractions. The results reveal that nuclear Bcl2 expression is enhanced within 60 min (Fig. 3B). After 3 h, the increased levels of nuclear Bcl2 are gradually reduced to the same level as the no treatment control (i.e. after the 6-h time point; Fig. 3B), indicating that NNK-enhanced nuclear Bcl2 expression occurs in a time-dependent manner. By contrast, the levels of mitochondrial Bcl2 show no significant change in the time course experiment (Fig. 3B, lower panel). Thus, increased nuclear Bcl2 may not result from a movement from mitochondria into nucleus. This effect on Bcl2 following exposure of cells to NNK may occur through a transcriptional or other unknown mechanism(s). Further study is required to demonstrate this possibility. To test for a direct interaction between Bcl2 and APE1 in nucleus, a co-immunoprecipitation was performed using isolated nuclear extract and an agarose-conjugated APE1 antibody. The results reveal that NNK-induced DNA damage promotes Bcl2 to associate with APE1 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3C, upper panel). Thus, Bcl2 suppression of APE1 activity and AP site repair may occur in a novel mechanism by a direct interaction with APE1. Bcl2 Directly Interacts with APE1 via Its BH Domains, and Deletion of Any of the BH Domains from Bcl2 Results in Loss of the Ability of Bcl2 to Suppress APE1 Endonuclease Activity and AP Site Repair—Bcl2 family members share homology in the BH domains including BH1, BH2, BH3, and BH4 (21Kelekar A. Thompson C. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 324-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). To assess whether Bcl2 directly binds to APE1 via its BH domains, purified recombinant APE1 protein (10 ng) was incubated with purified recombinant WT, ΔBH1, ΔBH2, ΔBH3, or ΔBH4 Bcl2 deletion mutants (10 ng each) in 1% CHAPS lysis buffer at 4 °C for 2 h. The APE1-associated Bcl2 was co-immunoprecipitated with an agarose-conjugated APE1 antibody. The results demonstrate that APE1 is able to associate with WT but not with any of the ΔBH1, ΔBH2, ΔBH3, and ΔBH4 Bcl2 mutants (Fig. 4B, lower panel), indicating that all BH domains are essential for Bcl2 to interact with APE1. Because WT Bcl2 could not be immunoprecipitated by the APE1 antibody in the absence of APE1 (Fig. 4B, lower panel, lane 1 versus lane 2), this suggests that the binding of Bcl2 to APE1 is specific in this assay. To test whether Bcl2 protein directly affects APE1 endonuclease activity in vitro, a 32P-labeled, AP site mimetic, double-stranded F oligonucleotide was incubated with purified, active APE1 (1 ng/ml) in the absence or presence of purified recombinant WT or each of the BH deletion Bcl2 mutant proteins (1 ng/ml each) in the assay buffer as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results reveal that purified APE1 efficiently cleaves the 26-mer oligonucleotides into a 14-mer fragment (Fig. 4C, lane 2). The addition of purified WT Bcl2 protein prevents the 26-mer oligonucleotide from cleavage induced by APE1 (Fig. 4C, lane 3), suggesting that Bcl2 can directly inhibit APE1 endonuclease activity in vitro. Intriguingly, all of the BH deletion Bcl2 mutant proteins fail to suppress APE1-induced cleavage of 26-mer oligonucleotide (Fig. 4C, lanes 4–7), indicating that deletion of any of the BH domains abrogates the capacity of Bcl2 to inhibit APE1 endonuclease activity. To functionally test this in vivo, APE1 endonuclease activity and AP sites of DNA lesions were compared in cells expressing WT or each of the BH deletion mutants. The results indicate that higher levels of APE1 endonuclease activity and accelerated AP site repair were observed in cells expressing each of the BH deletion mutants as compared with WT Bcl2-expressing cells (Fig. 4, D–F). This supports the notion that the binding of Bcl2 to APE1 via its BH domains may be required for the effect of Bcl2 on APE1 activity and AP site repair. Overexpression of Bcl2 in Cells Inhibits Formation of the APE1·XRCC1 Complex, and Purified Bcl2 Directly Disrupts the APE1·XRCC1 Interaction in Association with a Dose-dependent Inhibition of APE1 Endonuclease Activity in Vitro—It has been reported that a physical interaction between APE1 and XRCC1 significantly enhances APE1 endonuclease activity (22Vidal A. Boiteux S. Hickson I. Radicella J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6530-6539Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Because Bcl2 not only directly interacts with APE1 but also suppresses APE1 endonuclease activity in association with inhibition of AP site repair (Figs. 2, 3, 4), Bcl2 may affect the functional interaction between APE1 and XRCC1 via binding to APE1. To test this, association of APE1·XRCC1 was compared in Bcl2-overexpressing H1299 cells and vector-only control cells in the absence and presence of NNK. The results reveal that decreased levels of the APE1·XRCC1 complex were observed in the Bcl2-overexpressing cells as compared with vector control cells with or without NNK treatment, suggesting that expression of Bcl2 inhibits formation of the APE1·XRCC1 complex in cells (Fig. 5A). To further test whether Bcl2 can directly dissociate the APE1·XRCC1 complex in vitro, the APE1·XRCC1 complex was co-immunoprecipitated from H1299 parental cells expressing undetectable levels of endogenous Bcl2 using an APE1 antibody. The immune complex was incubated with increasing concentrations of purified, recombinant Bcl2 at 4 °C for up to 2 h, and proteins released from the complex were identified in the supernatant following centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 5 min. Surprisingly, Bcl2 directly disrupts the APE1·XRCC1 complex in vitro because the addition of purified Bcl2 results in decreased levels of bound XRCC1 on beads and increased levels of nonbound XRCC1 in the supernatant (Fig. 5B). Functionally, the addition of increasing concentrations (0.1–5 ng/ml) of purified, recombinant Bcl2 protein to the nuclear extract(s) isolated from H1299 parental cells results in a dose-dependent reduction in the production of the cleaved fragments (i.e. 14-mer) with a gradual increase of the uncleaved 26-mer oligonucleotides (Fig. 5C). Thus, in addition to a direct binding to APE1, Bcl2-mediated attenuation of APE1 endonuclease activity may also occur, at least in part, through disrupting a functional APE1·XRCC1 association. Specific Knockdown of Bcl2 Expression by RNA Interference Enhance APE1 Endonuclease Activity and Promotes AP Site Repair—To test a physiological role for Bcl2 in regulating APE1 activity and the repair of AP sites, a gene silencing approach was employed to specifically deplete the endogenous Bcl2 from H460 cells that express high levels of endogenous Bcl2. Recent studies have demonstrated that transfection of cells with siRNA concentrations greater than 100 nm frequently produces nonspecific off-target effects, and a concentration of 20–100 nm only occasionally produces off-target effects (23Cullen B. Nat. Methods. 2006; 3: 677-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). However, siRNA concentrations of 10–20 nm generally do not exert nonspecific effects (24Semizarov D. Frost L. Sarthy A. Kroeger P. Halbert D. Fesik S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6347-6352Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). To minimize nonspecific effects, we chose 10 nm of Bcl2 siRNA in the RNA interference experiment. The results reveal that transfection of Bcl2 siRNA significantly reduces the expression level of endogenous Bcl2 by more than 95% in H460 cells (Fig. 6A). This effect of siRNA on Bcl2 expression is highly specific because the control siRNA has no effect (Fig. 6A). Importantly, depletion of Bcl2 from H460 cells expressing high levels of endogenous Bcl2 up-regulates APE1 endonuclease activity (i.e. increased amount of the cleaved, 14-mer products) in association with accelerated AP site repair (Fig. 6, B and C). These findings provide strong evidence that physiologically expressed Bcl2 in cells is able to suppress AP site repair through a mechanism involving the inhibition of APE1 endonuclease activity. One of the most prevalent lesions in DNA is the AP site, which is the product of DNA glycosylases and the first DNA intermediate in the process of BER. If left unrepaired, AP sites are potentially genotoxic and/or mutagenic (25Loeb L. Cell. 1985; 40: 483-484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). APE1, the second enzyme in BER pathway, initiates the repair of AP sites (22Vidal A. Boiteux S. Hickson I. Radicella J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6530-6539Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Growing evidence indicates that Bcl2 can suppress the repair of various types of DNA damage, including AP sites of DNA lesions, in association with increased genetic instability (4Jin Z. May W.S. Gao F. Flagg T. Deng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14446-14456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 10Kuo M. Shiah S. Wang C. Chuang S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 894-901PubMed Google Scholar, 11Liu Y. Naumovski L. Hanawalt P. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1650-1653PubMed Google Scholar, 12Saintigny Y. Dumay A. Lambert S. Lopez B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2596-2607Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 13Youn C.K. Cho H. Kim S. Kim H. Kim M. Chang I. Lee J. Chung M. Hahm K. You H. Nat.

However, the molecular mechanism(s) by which Bcl2 regulates AP site repair remains elusive. Here we found that overexpression of Bcl2 suppresses APE1 endonuclease activity with decreased AP site repair (Fig. 2). Conversely, depletion of endogenous Bcl2 by RNA interference from H460 cells expressing high levels of endogenous Bcl2 enhances APE1 endonuclease activity in association with accelerated AP site repair (Fig. 6). These findings suggest that the inhibitory effect of Bcl2 on AP site repair may occur, at least in part, through down-regulating APE1 endonuclease activity. Bcl2 is mainly localized in mitochondrial membranes to maintain the mitochondrial integrity. Mounting evidence indicates that Bcl2 has also been found in the nucleoplasm and functions within the nucleus (4Jin Z. May W.S. Gao F. Flagg T. Deng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14446-14456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 19Hoetelmans R. van Slooten H. Keijzer R. Erkeland S. van de Velde C. Dierendonck J. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 384-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 20Schardle C. Li S. Re G. Fan W. Willinghamm M. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1999; 47: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, the nuclear Bcl2 does not have antiapoptotic function but still has ability to regulate DNA repair (4Jin Z. May W.S. Gao F. Flagg T. Deng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14446-14456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). APE1 is mainly localized in the nucleus, but cytoplasmic APE1 can also be observed in some cell types (3Tell G. Damante G. Caldwell D. Kelley M. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2005; 7: 367-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Here we found that NNK-induced DNA damage signal can stimulate Bcl2 accumulation in nucleus, which subsequently interacts with APE1 (Fig. 3). This may be a potential mechanism by which Bcl2 down-regulates APE1 activity with suppression of AP site DNA repair. Bcl2 family members share homology in regions designated the BH domains BH1, BH2, BH3, and BH4 (21Kelekar A. Thompson C. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 324-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Structure-function studies with Bcl2 deletion mutants reveal that APE1 directly interacts with Bcl2 and that all of the BH domains in Bcl2 are required for this interaction (Fig. 4, A and B). Because the BH1, BH2, and BH3 domains form the surface binding pocket of Bcl2 (27Castelli M. Reiners J. Kessel D. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 906-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), our findings suggest that in addition to the BH4 domain, the integrity of the surface binding pocket of Bcl2 is also important for Bcl2 to associate with APE1. Functionally, deletion of any of the BH domains abolishes the capacity of Bcl2 to suppress APE1 endonuclease activity as well as AP site repair (Fig. 4), indicating that the physical Bcl2-APE1 binding is required for the effects of Bcl2 on APE1 and AP site repair. XRCC1 acting as both a scaffold and a modulator of the different activities involved in BER provides a link between the incision and sealing steps of the AP site repair process. Intriguingly, XRCC1 not only physically interacts with APE1 but also potently stimulates its enzymatic activity (22Vidal A. Boiteux S. Hickson I. Radicella J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6530-6539Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Because overexpression of Bcl2 in cells or the addition of purified Bcl2 to the APE1·XRCC1 complex directly disrupts APE1·XRCC1 association (Fig. 5), this supports the notion that the inhibitory effect of Bcl2 on APE1 function may result from its physical binding to APE1 and/or subsequent disruption of the APE1·XRCC1 complex. In summary, our findings have uncovered a novel molecular mechanism by which Bcl2 suppresses AP site repair through inhibition of APE1 endonuclease activity. NNK-induced AP sites of DNA lesions facilitate Bcl2 accumulation in nucleus and interaction with APE1 via its BH domains, leading to decreased APE1 activity and attenuation of AP site repair. Because AP sites are mutagenic, Bcl2-mediated suppression of AP site repair may facilitate mutagenesis, genetic instability, and/or cancer development."
https://openalex.org/W2053449516,"One of the most extreme and fascinating examples of naturally occurring mutagenesis is represented by circular permutation. Circular permutations involve the linking of two chain ends and cleavage at another site. Here we report the first description of the folding mechanism of a naturally occurring circularly permuted protein, a PDZ domain from the green alga Scenedesmus obliquus. Data reveal that the folding of the permuted protein is characterized by the presence of a low energy off-pathway kinetic trap. This finding contrasts with what was previously observed for canonical PDZ domains that, although displaying a similar primary structure when structurally re-aligned, fold via an on-pathway productive intermediate. Although circular permutation of PDZ domains may be necessary for a correct orientation of their functional sites in multi-domain protein scaffolds, such structural rearrangement may compromise their folding pathway. This study provides a straightforward example of the divergent demands of folding and function.

This study provides a straightforward example of the divergent demands of folding and function. A crucial development of our knowledge on protein folding has been contributed by correlating rate constants of folding of small proteins with their topology as measured by the gross parameter of the contact order (1Baker D. Nature. 2000; 405: 39-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). The contact order represents the average distance, on the primary structure, between interacting residues in the tertiary structure. A protein with a low contact order will by and large present interacting residues that are close in sequence. On the other hand, high contact order implies a large number of long-range interactions. Baker and coworkers (2Plaxco K.W. Simons K.T. Baker D. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 985-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar) first showed a strong correlation between kinetic and structural parameters, suggesting that protein topology is a key factor in determining the folding pathways and speed. An important corollary of these observations is that folding transition states must reflect a distorted version of the native state. This feature was already captured by the nucleation condensation model (3Abkevich V.I. Gutin A.M. Shakhnovich E.I. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10026-10036Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 4Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 21: 10869-10873Crossref Scopus (459) Google Scholar), which suggested the protein to fold all at once around an extended, weakly formed, folding nucleus. The notion that protein folding pathways are governed by protein topology (1Baker D. Nature. 2000; 405: 39-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar) has recently been challenged by ingenious experiments using topological mutants such as circularly permuted variants (5Li L. Shakhnovich E.I. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 6Lindberg M. Tangrot J. Oliveberg M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 818-822PubMed Google Scholar, 7Miller E.J. Fischer K.F. Marqusee S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10359-10363Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 8Otzen D.E. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8139-8146Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 9Viguera A.R. Serrano L. Wilmanns M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 874-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Despite the dramatic change experienced by the primary structure, circular permutations seem well tolerated by several protein sequences. In nature, circular permutations have been recognized in ∼5% of proteins of known structures (10Lindqvist Y. Schneider G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 422-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 11Vogel C. Morea V. BioEssays. 2006; 28: 973-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Folding studies on artificially permuted proteins have been specifically aimed at monitoring the effect on both folding speed and mechanism. By systematically altering the sequence connectivity of the ribosomal protein S6, Oliveberg and coworkers (12Lindberg M.O. Tångrot J. Otzen D.E. Dolgikh D.A. Finkelstein A.V. Oliveberg M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 891-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) showed that protein folding rate constants of circularly permuted variants are well predicted by the contact order parameter. On the other hand, analysis of protein folding pathways reveals apparently contradicting results. In particular, while the folding pathway of chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 retains its nucleus when challenged with circular permutation (8Otzen D.E. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8139-8146Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), both S6 and the Src homology 3 domain appear to fold via different folding trajectories (6Lindberg M. Tangrot J. Oliveberg M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 818-822PubMed Google Scholar, 9Viguera A.R. Serrano L. Wilmanns M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 874-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In an attempt to reconcile these contradicting results, Lindberg and Oliveberg (13Lindberg M.O. Oliveberg M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2007; 17: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) recently suggested pathway malleability to be a consensus feature of protein folding. When and if the denatured chain may reach its native conformation by means of different independent nuclei, circular permutation, involving the cleavage of a folding nucleus present in a dominant foldon, may result in a different dominant folding pathway. A critical test to verify this hypothesis would imply performing circular permutation experiments of multi-state single domain proteins. Indeed, if pathway malleability is a general feature of protein folding, it is tempting to speculate that circular permutation may affect the stability and possibly the mechanistic role of folding intermediates. Based on lattice model simulations, Li and Shakhnovich (5Li L. Shakhnovich E.I. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) predicted circular permutation to remarkably affect the stability of folding intermediates. No experimental folding study has been so far performed on a multi-state single domain protein. PDZ domains are small globular protein-protein interacting modules that display a fold comprising six β-strands and two α-helices (Fig. 1). Although numerous PDZ domains are found in bacteria and plants, their presence in yeast is questionable. It has therefore been suggested that the PDZ domains in bacteria and plants result from horizontal gene transfer (14Harris B.Z. Lim W.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3219-3231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the PDZ domains from bacteria and plants may be considered as circularly permuted variants of their metazoan counterparts, i.e. sharing the same overall fold but characterized by N and C termini located at different positions along the sequence (15Liao D.I.

Hence, this protein family represents an ideal system to investigate the relationships between sequence connectivity and protein topology and, for the first time, on naturally evolved sequences. The canonical eukaryotic PDZ domains have been shown to fold via a conserved mechanism involving an on-pathway intermediate (16Gianni S. Calosci N. Aelen J.M. Vuister G.W. Brunori M.

Here we report the kinetic folding mechanism of a PDZ domain of the D1 C-terminal-processing protease (D1pPDZ) from the green alga S. obliquus (15Liao D.I. Qian J. Chisholm D.A. Jordan D.B. Diner B.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 749-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). the second PDZ domain from murine Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase-Bas-Like PDZ domain of D1 C-terminal-processing protease from S. obliquus. A structure-based sequence alignment of D1pPDZ with other PDZ domains (Fig. 1) reveals that the primary structure of D1pPDZ is similar to that of its canonical counterparts, displaying pairwise sequence identity of ∼25% and sequence similarity of ∼50%. Despite the high degree of sequence similarity with other members of the PDZ domain family, we have demonstrated here that the folding of D1pPDZ differs considerably from the folding of the canonical PDZ domains and its denatured state may be trapped to a misfolded intermediate that competes with productive folding. Protein Expression and Purification—A synthetic gene encoding D1pPDZ (residues 159–253 of the full D1p) (15Liao D.I. Qian J. Chisholm D.A. Jordan D.B. Diner B.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 749-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) was purchased from GENEART. As previously described for other PDZ domains (17Chi C.N. Gianni S. Calosci N. Travaglini-Allocatelli C. Engstrom K. Jemth P. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 1109-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), an engineered tryptophan was introduced to function as a fluorescent probe (V178W). The gene was subcloned into the expression vector pET28(c), and protein was expressed in BL21(DE3) cells (Invitrogen) as described elsewhere (16Gianni S. Calosci N. Aelen J.M. Vuister G.W. Brunori M. Travaglini-Allocatelli C. Prot. Eng. Des. Sel. 2005; 18: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). After induction with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside the cells were grown for 24 h at 25 °C. The resulting hexahis-tagged protein partly formed inclusion bodies and was resuspended using an excess of urea and purified using nickel affinity chromatography (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, elution using a gradient from 0–1 m imidazole). D1pPDZ was also independently purified from soluble fractions (using a nickel affinity column followed by an S cation exchanger resin), resulting in protein samples displaying similar folding behavior (data not shown). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Four single mutants were constructed, (A188G, V202A, V215A, and V227A), and the mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing of the coding regions. Equilibrium Denaturations—Urea-induced equilibrium experiments were performed on wild type D1pPDZ in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 25 °C, in the absence and presence of 0.4 m sodium sulfate using a FluoroMax-4 spectrofluorometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon). Protein samples were excited at 280 nm, and the emission spectra were recorded between 320 and 380 nm. The experiments were repeated at different protein concentrations (0.2–15 μm). Urea-induced equilibrium denaturations were also performed on the four mutants of D1pPDZ at a protein concentration of 1 μm and in 0.4 m sodium sulfate. Kinetic Experiments—Single-jump (un)folding experiments on wild type D1pPDZ were performed using a Pi-star stopped-flow apparatus (Applied Photophysics, Leatherhead, UK) in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, in the presence and in the absence of 0.4 m sodium sulfate. The protein sample was excited at 280 nm, and the folding reaction was followed by the change in fluorescence using different cutoff filters (305, 320, 335, and 360 nm). An 11-fold dilution of denatured or native protein in appropriate buffer initiated refolding and unfolding. Single-jump (un)folding experiments were also performed on the four variants of D1pPDZ in the presence of 0.4 m sodium sulfate, using the 360 nm cutoff filter. Double-jump interrupted refolding experiments were carried out on an SX18-MV stopped-flow instrument (Applied Photophysics) in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 25 °C and 0.4 m sodium sulfate. Two different double-jump interrupted refolding experiments are reported. On one hand, unfolded D1pPDZ (in 2 or 4 m urea) was allowed to refold for 300 ms (in 1 or 2 m urea, 0.4 m sodium sulfate) and then challenged with different urea concentrations to measure the unfolding rate constant of the intermediate state at different urea concentrations. The combined chevron plot obtained from single- and double-jump experiments was adequately fitted to the analytical solution of the quadratic equation describing folding with an off-pathway intermediate, as previously described (20Jemth P. Gianni S. Day R. Li B. Johnson C.M. Daggett V. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6450-6455Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the time-resolved native state appearances of wild type D1pPDZ and site-directed mutants were studied by performing double-jump interrupted refolding experiments at different delay times between a first (refolding) and a second (unfolding) mix as described previously (21Kiefhaber T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 101: 9029-9033Crossref Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Binding Assays—A peptide (EAPSVNA) mimicking the physiological substrate of D1pPDZ (22Trost J.T.

Equilibrium binding experiments were carried out by exciting the tryptophan at 280 nm and measuring the fluorescence emission of the protein sample (at a protein concentration of 4 μm) between 315 and 385 nm in the presence of different peptide concentrations (10–1500 μm). Data were recorded in the presence of 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, at 25 °C. The function of the D1 C-terminal-processing protease is to remove the C-terminal extension of the D1 polypeptide of photosystem II of oxygenic photosynthesis, which is necessary for assembly of the photosynthesis complex (23Diner B.A. Ries D.F. Cohen B.N. Metz J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8972-8980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Fujita S. Inagaki N. Ono T. Inoue Y. Satoh K. FEBS Lett. 1989; 255: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The suggested function of the PDZ of D1p is to serve as binding site of the C-terminal extension of the target protein (15Liao D.I. Qian J. Chisholm D.A. Jordan D.B. Diner B.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 749-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). A synthetic peptide (EAPSVNA) mimicking the suggested natural binding target, the C-terminal extension of the D1 polypeptide of photosystem II (15Liao D.I. Qian J. Chisholm D.A. Jordan D.B. Diner B.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 749-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 23Diner B.A. Ries D.F. Cohen B.N. Metz J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8972-8980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was employed in ligand binding equilibrium experiments on wild type D1pPDZ (Fig. 2). As previously shown in the case of the PDZ domain family, binding of a ligand may induce a small conformational change that can be probed by intrinsic fluorescence (25Gianni S. Engstrom A. Larsson M. Calosci N. Malatesta F. Eklund L. Ngang C.C. Travaglini-Allocatelli C. Jemth P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34805-34812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The effect of the ligand binding on the tryptophan fluorescence emission of wild type D1pPDZ was followed between 315 and 385 nm at different peptide concentrations (10–1500 μm). The observed transition corresponds to a simple binding isotherm at all wavelengths. The data were fitted to a hyperbolic equation, yielding an apparent KD of ∼250 μm, which is very similar to the Km of the recombinant full D1p (∼300 μm) (26Yamamoto Y. Inagaki N. Satoh K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7518-7525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This suggests that the isolated D1pPDZ domain binds its physiological target sequence with an affinity consistent with previous experiments. These observations indicate that the recombinant D1pPDZ is in a native functionally competent conformation. Urea-induced equilibrium denaturations of D1pPDZ in the presence and absence of stabilizing salt (0.4 m sodium sulfate), monitored by decrease of tryptophan emission, are reported in Fig. 3. At all recorded wavelengths the observed transition follows a simple two-state behavior that would suggest the absence of stable equilibrium intermediates. However, as detailed below, quantitative analysis of observed kinetics reveals a complex (un)folding mechanism of D1pPDZ involving at least one intermediate. The thermodynamic parameters calculated from Fig. 3 using a two-state model are listed in Table 1. Importantly, calculated parameters were independent of protein concentration, as revealed by equilibrium unfolding experiments performed at different protein concentrations (varying from 0.2 to 15 μm).TABLE 1Equilibrium and kinetic folding parameters of D1pPDZ and its site-directed variants[urea]1/2aCalculated from urea-induced equilibrium denaturations.mD-NaCalculated from urea-induced equilibrium denaturations.kDIbCalculated by fitting globally the two observed relaxation rate constants to the analytical solution of a three-state mechanism involving an off-pathway intermediate.kIDbCalculated by fitting globally the two observed relaxation rate constants to the analytical solution of a three-state mechanism involving an off-pathway intermediate.kDNbCalculated by fitting globally the two observed relaxation rate constants to the analytical solution of a three-state mechanism involving an off-pathway intermediate.kNDbCalculated by fitting globally the two observed relaxation rate constants to the analytical solution of a three-state mechanism involving an off-pathway intermediate.mkcal mol-1 m-1s-1kcal mol-1 m-1s-1kcal mol-1 m-1Wild type3.8 ± 0.051.1 ± 0.133 ± 30.20 ± 0.0127 ± 20.005 ± 0.001A188G2.7 ± 0.051.2 ± 0.135 ± 21.5 ± 0.0714 ± 10.07 ± 0.01V202A0.9 ± 0.11.0 ± 0.116 ± 11.2 ± 0.042.0 ± 0.30.06 ± 0.01V215A1.3 ± 0.11.0 ± 0.124 ± 22.0 ± 0.24.3 ± 0.80.05 ± 0.01V227A1.6 ± 0.10.9 ± 0.116 ± 11.1 ± 0.051.9 ± 0.20.06 ± 0.01a Calculated from urea-induced equilibrium denaturations.b Calculated by fitting globally the two observed relaxation rate constants to the analytical solution of a three-state mechanism involving an off-pathway intermediate. Open table in a new tab The kinetics of the (un)folding of D1pPDZ was investigated by single- and double-jump stopped-flow experiments both in the absence and in the presence of stabilizing salt (0.4 m sodium sulfate). The engineered tryptophan was excited at 280 nm, and the (un)folding reactions were followed by fluorescence using different cutoff filters (Fig. 4). Regardless of the filter used, the refolding was clearly biphasic. The fluorescence signals and the relative amplitudes of the two phases were highly dependent on the cutoff filter used, allowing unequivocal determination of the two rate constants over a wide range of denaturant concentration. Furthermore, the two observed phases were independent of protein concentration within a range of 1–80 μm, thus excluding the possibility of transient aggregation events (27Silow M. Oliveberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 1997: 6084-6086Crossref Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The enhanced stability of D1pPDZ in the presence of the stabilizing salt allowed a quantitative description of all the microscopic rate constants describing D1pPDZ folding. Hence, for the purpose of this study we focus on kinetic data recorded in the presence of 0.4 m sodium sulfate. The urea dependence of the two (un)folding rate constants (chevron plot) of D1pPDZ is reported in Fig. 5a. The biphasic behavior of the refolding may be explained either by an on-pathway scheme, in which the fast formation of intermediate (I) is followed by formation of native protein (N), or by an off-pathway scheme, in which there is a competing formation of I and N from denatured protein followed by slow breakdown of I (20Jemth P. Gianni S. Day R. Li B. Johnson C.M. Daggett V. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6450-6455Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Discrimination among the on- and off-pathway scenarios demands experiments aimed at the detection of the fraction of native molecules forming along the time course (see Fig. 4, c and d, in Ref. 20Jemth P. Gianni S. Day R. Li B. Johnson C.M. Daggett V. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6450-6455Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Following Kiefhaber (21Kiefhaber T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 101: 9029-9033Crossref Scopus (296) Google Scholar), such a task may be tackled by performing double-jump interrupted refolding experiments. This approach makes it possible to distinguish partially folded intermediates from native molecules because these states are characterized by different unfolding rate constants. In particular, the native protein, being separated from the denatured state by the highest energy barrier, should unfold more slowly than any partially folded intermediate. Thus, the fractional population of native molecules formed during the delay time, between a first (refolding) and a second (unfolding) mix, is represented by the relative amplitude of the slowest unfolding event. In agreement with an off-pathway scenario, the amplitudes were readily fitted to a double exponential decay (Fig. 5b), the on-pathway mechanism predicting single exponential behavior and a lag phase, as was discussed elsewhere (20Jemth P. Gianni S. Day R. Li B. Johnson C.M. Daggett V. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6450-6455Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). On the basis of this observation we conclude that the observed intermediate in the folding of D1pPDZ is an off-pathway species. It is accepted that multiple pathways leading to fast and slow formation of native molecules may either arise from genuine transiently populated off-pathway intermediates or from structural heterogeneity in the denatured state, as in the case of prolyl-peptidyl cis-trans isomerization events (28Jackson S.E. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10436-10443Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). It should be noticed that, whereas in the first scenario the biphasic appearance of native molecules essentially arises from the fortuitous similarity of the microscopic rate constants for intermediate and native state formation (kinetic coupling), in the latter a multi-phasic signal change is always associated with a multi-phasic native state appearance. In the former case, the relative fraction of native molecules channeled into a fast folding track will approximately approach the partition coefficient as shown in Equation 1 Kpart=kDNkDN+kDI(Eq. 1) where kDN and kDI are the microscopic rate constants for native and intermediate state formation, respectively. To further strengthen our hypothesis of an off-pathway intermediate, we compared the folding kinetics of D1pPDZ with that of destabilized site-directed mutants. Because our purpose was to probe the effect of site-directed mutagenesis on the kinetic coupling between intermediate and native state formation, our strategy was to alter the stability of their relative transition states by introducing conservative mutations in different regions of D1pPDZ (namely A188G, V202A, V215A, and V227A; see Fig. 1). The (un)folding kinetics observed for the four mutants were all biphasic, and the chevron plots of the different variants are shown in Fig. 6 together with their urea-induced equilibrium unfolding. Calculated folding parameters according to a three-state off-pathway folding model are listed in Table 1. Importantly, while the four variants display a biphasic fluorescence refolding kinetics, their native state appearance follows a single exponential time course in some cases, as expected from a reduced Kpart partition coefficient (Fig. 7). This observation suggests that by selectively destabilizing the transition state for intermediate and native state formation it is possible to fine-tune the kinetic coupling responsible for the heterogeneous native state appearance.FIGURE 7Fraction of native molecules being formed during the refolding time course as detected by interrupted refolding experiments for four site-directed mutants of D1pPDZ. As explained under “Results,” due to the kinetic coupling between intermediate and native state formation, the off-pathway model is expected to be associated to a significant fraction of native molecules (Kpart, see Equation 1) forming via a fast folding track. a, A188G, Kpart = 0.3 ± 0.04. The line is the best fit to a double exponential function. All the other mutants (panels b–d) were satisfactorily fitted to a single exponential function. b, V202A, Kpart = 0.11 ± 0.03. c, V215A, Kpart = 0.15 ± 0.04. d, V227A, Kpart = 0.1 ± 0.02. All data were recorded in the presence of 1 m urea, 0.4 m sodium sulfate, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 25 °C (i.e. final conditions after the first mix).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The strategy of circular permutation has been applied to a number of small protein domains, aiming at the investigation of the stability and folding mechanisms upon change of sequence connectivity (5Li L.

Biol. 1996; 3: 874-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The most important theoretical break-through in the protein folding field is generally considered the concept of funneled energy landscape (29Onuchic J.N. Luthey-Schulten Z. Wolynes P.G. Annu. Rev. Phys. Chem. 1997; 48: 545-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (1715) Google Scholar), which suggests the denatured chain to fold to its native conformation via an energy landscape displaying an overall funneled topography. Under such conditions, folding is considered a stochastic process so that a protein reaches its native conformation through folding pathways made up by an ensemble of different trajectories. Because many proteins exhibit single folding pathways, it has been difficult to establish the extent to which these trajectories can differ from each other and characterize the different routes by exquisitely experimental studies. In a recent review, Lindberg and Oliveberg (13Lindberg M.O. Oliveberg M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2007; 17: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) proposed the shifts in folding pathways induced by circular permutation to be a consequence of the funneled energy landscape. Loop entropy perturbations, introduced by permutation, may specifically destabilize dominant folding pathways and favor alternative routes. Thus, the study of circularly permuted proteins provides the unique opportunity to explore experimentally the role of topology on different competing folding trajectories of a given protein. In line with these observations, understanding the effect of circular permutations on multi-state proteins may provide clear-cut evidence for pathway rerouting along the folding funnel. Here we report the first folding mechanism of a multi-state naturally evolved circularly permuted protein in comparison to that of previously characterized PDZ domains (16Gianni S. Calosci N.

Vendruscolo M. Brunori M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 128-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In agreement with theoretical predictions (5Li L. Shakhnovich E.I. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), in the case of the PDZ family circular permutation produces a remarkable stabilization of a folding intermediate. Indeed, contrary to what has been observed for other members of the PDZ family (17Chi C.N. Gianni S. Calosci N. Travaglini-Allocatelli C. Engstrom K. Jemth P. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 1109-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), (i) the intermediate observed for D1pPDZ is a low energy species accumulating during folding; (ii) surprisingly, such an intermediate state represents an off-pathway kinetic trap competing with PDZ folding. It is tempting to speculate that the off-pathway intermediate in the folding of D1pPDZ involves the formation of contacts between residues in the two last β strands, which in the related eukaryotic PDZ domains correspond to a long-range early forming folding nucleus (19Gianni S. Geierhaas C.D. Calosci N. Jemth P. Vuister G.W. Travaglini-Allocatelli C. Vendruscolo M. Brunori M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 128-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Loop entropy perturbations, such as circular permutation, may at the same time perturb the productive folding pathway and stabilize this nucleus, which may thus act as a kinetic trap. It has been suggested that folding pathways of single domain proteins are selected to avoid local energy traps and that protein sequences are sufficiently optimized to rely on minimal energetic frustration of their energy landscapes (30Ferreiro D.U. Hegler J.A. Komives E.A. Wolynes P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; : 19819-19824Google Scholar, 31Oliveberg M. Wolynes P.G. Q. Rev. Biophys. 2006; 38: 245-288Crossref Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The observation that protein folding pathways display energetic traps when sequence connectivity is varied may provide new insights in the energy landscape theory for protein folding, suggesting that (i) alterations of sequence connectivity may dramatically alter the preferential folding pathway of a given protein, and (ii) in line with the observations by Baker (1Baker D. Nature. 2000; 405: 39-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar), protein topology, rather than sequence composition, plays per se a major role in sculpting folding energy landscapes and in optimizing the minimal frustration requirement for productive (and fast) folding. PDZ domains are generally part of multi-domain proteins, and they exert their function by recognizing small target motifs exploiting a specific binding groove. Circular permutation of PDZ domains may have been necessary for the proper integration of the PDZ binding site with respect to the functional sites of other domains (11Vogel C. Morea V. BioEssays. 2006; 28: 973-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, it appears as if the divergent evolutionary demands of function and folding have compromised the folding process of D1pPDZ, as indicated by the presence of a misfolded kinetic trap in the folding process. Over and above the relevant exception of the sunflower albumin 8, which displays an unusually high portion of solvent-exposed hydrophobic residues (32Pandya M.J. Williams P.B. Dempsey C.E. Shewry P.R. Clarke A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 38: 26828-26837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (18) Google Scholar), this was rarely observed in the folding of small single domain proteins. The proteins showing off-pathway kinetic traps often display a complex topology (33Wu Y. Vadrevu R. Kathuria S. Yang X. Matthews C.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 366: 1624-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The molecular details of the folding of the D1pPDZ to its native and intermediate states remain to be elucidated by extensive ϕ-value analysis (34Fersht A.R. Sato S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7976-7981Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Finally, given the postulated relevance of off-pathway intermediates in triggering major misfolding events (35Dobson C.M. Nature. 2003; 426: 884-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (3815) Google Scholar), the notable stability of the off-pathway intermediate of D1pPDZ makes it an excellent candidate to further explore the early events of protein misfolding."
https://openalex.org/W2051122740,"Small insertions and deletions of trinucleotide repeats (TNRs) can occur by polymerase slippage and hairpin formation on either template or newly synthesized strands during replication. Although not predicted by a slippage model, deletions occur preferentially when 5′-CTG is in the lagging strand template and are highly favored over insertion events in rapidly replicating cells. The mechanism for the deletion bias and the orientation dependence of TNR instability is poorly understood. We report here that there is an orientation-dependent impediment to polymerase progression on 5′-CAG and 5′-CTG repeats that can be relieved by the binding of single-stranded DNA-binding protein. The block depends on the primary sequence of the TNR but does not correlate with the thermodynamic stability of hairpins. The orientation-dependent block of polymerase passage is the strongest when 5′-CAG is the template. We propose a “template-push” model in which the slow speed of DNA polymerase across the 5′-CAG leading strand template creates a threat to helicase-polymerase coupling. To prevent uncoupling, the TNR template is pushed out and by-passed. Hairpins do not cause the block, but appear to occur as a consequence of polymerase pass-over.

Expansion of simple trinucleotide repeats (TNRs) 4The abbreviations used are: TNR, trinucleotide repeat; HA, hydroxyapatite; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; SSB, ssDNA-binding protein; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; DTT, dithiothreitol; IPTG, isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein. 4The abbreviations used are: TNR, trinucleotide repeat; HA, hydroxyapatite; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; SSB, ssDNA-binding protein; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; DTT, dithiothreitol; IPTG, isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein. is the underlying genetic defect of a number of human neurodegenerative diseases. TNR-associated pathophysiology in human diseases strictly depends on the number of trinucleotide repeats (reviewed in Refs. 1Mirkin S.M.

Genet. 2001; 27: 407-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) and in somatic cells with age (5Kovtun I.V. Liu Y. Bjoras M. Klungland A. Wilson S.H. McMurray C.T.

Genet. 1997; 15: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), emerging evidence suggests that rapid cell division in the early embryo can reduce the size of the repeats and modulate disease potential (7Kovtun I.V. Thornhill A.R. McMurray C.T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 3057-3068Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). TNR deletion during rapid cell division may serve as a natural defense mechanism for keeping the length of the repeats in check at critical times in development. Reducing the length of the repeat tract in disease genes is being explored as a therapeutic strategy. However, the mechanisms by which deletions rather than expansions are favored during replication remain poorly understood. DNA polymerase and strand slippage has been proposed as the primary mechanism for instability of trinucleotide repeats (1Mirkin S.M. Nature. 2007; 447: 932-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 2Bichara M. Wagner J. Lambert I.B. Mutat. Res. 2006; 598: 144-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 3Pearson C.E. Nichol Edamura K. Cleary J.D. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2005; 6: 729-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). During replication, the TNR units can misalign resulting in an extrahelical DNA loop that increases TNR length if it occurs on the daughter strand and decreases TNR length if it occurs on the template strand (1Mirkin S.M. Nature. 2007; 447: 932-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 2Bichara M. Wagner J. Lambert I.B. Mutat. Res. 2006; 598: 144-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 3Pearson C.E. Nichol Edamura K. Cleary J.D. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2005; 6: 729-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). In both prokaryotic and eukaryotic models, it is well established that TNR instability is sensitive to the length of the repeat (8Malter H.E. Iber J.C. Willemsen R. de Graaff E. Tarleton J.C.

Genet. 2002; 31: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The factors that regulate the probability and frequency of deletion events, however, remain poorly understood. By a polymerase slippage model, a deletion implies that hairpin formation has occurred on the template strand. Theoretically, for an identical sequence located either on the template or daughter strand, slippage and hairpin formation can occur with equivalent frequency on either strand. Yet, deletions are favored over insertions during replication by a factor of 102-105 in yeast and bacteria (14Spiro C. Pelletier R. Rolfsmeier M.L. Dixon M.J. Lahue R.S. Gupta G. Park M.S. Chen X. Mariappan S.V. McMurray C.T. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 1079-1085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). A simple slippage model does not predict the deletion bias. Equally puzzling is the orientation dependence of deletion. 5′-CTG repeats, for example, have greater susceptibility to deletions when they serve as a template for lagging strand DNA synthesis. However, as the leading strand template, 5′-CTG repeats are relatively stable (10Freudenreich C.H. Kantrow S.M. Zakian V.A. Science. 1998; 279: 853-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 19Kang S. Ohshima K. Shimizu M. Amirhaeri S. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27014-27021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The same phenomenon has been observed for 5′-CGG/5′-CCG repeats with fewer contractions when the 5′-CCG sequence is the template for lagging strand DNA synthesis (20Balakumaran B.S. Freudenreich C.H. Zakian V.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Thus, the frequency of TNR instability and the extent of deletion vary with the direction of replication fork progression, despite the fact that the same template sequence is being replicated (1Mirkin S.M. Nature. 2007; 447: 932-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 2Bichara M. Wagner J. Lambert I.B. Mutat. Res. 2006; 598: 144-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 3Pearson C.E.

First, biophysical (14Spiro C. Pelletier R. Rolfsmeier M.L. Dixon M.J. Lahue R.S. Gupta G. Park M.S. Chen X. Mariappan S.V. McMurray C.T. Mol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4202-4209Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) analyses have demonstrated that single-stranded 5′-CTG forms more stable hairpin structures than single-stranded 5′-CAG due to the presence of wobble pairing. Thus, the differential stability of 5′-CTG hairpins and their lifetimes may allow more frequent 5′-CTG loop entrapment and slippage during replication on the lagging strand template (23Zheng M. Huang X. Smith G.K. Yang X. Gao X. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 323-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 24Petruska J. Arnheim N. Goodman M.F.

If correct, however, it is not easy to explain why the thermodynamics of hairpin formation should apply only when 5′-CTG repeats are in the lagging strand template, and why hairpins should not be equally favored on the daughter strand. A second possibility is that the 5′-CTG template during lagging strand DNA synthesis inhibits the binding of single-stranded DNA binding (SSB) protein allowing 5′-CTG hairpins to exist transiently in a single-stranded state. The 5′-CTG hairpins might form more rapidly or unfold more slowly relative to 5′-CAG hairpins in the same orientation (8Malter H.E. Iber J.C. Willemsen R. de Graaff E. Tarleton J.C. Leisti J. Warren S.T. Oostra B.A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 26Usdin K. Woodford K.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4202-4209Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). However, there are few biochemical data on the interaction of SSB with TNR tracts. Finally, TNR instability is influenced by transcription, which is inherently strand-specific. However, the effects of transcription are system-dependent. In cultured mammalian cells, long repeat tracts tend to delete (28Lin Y. Dion V. Wilson J.H. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 179-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). However, in animal models for 5′-CAG repeat diseases, TNR sequences tend to expand in somatic cells even though transcription is active (5Kovtun I.V. Liu Y. Bjoras M. Klungland A. Wilson S.H. McMurray C.T. Nature. 2007; 447: 447-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 6Mangiarini L. Sathasivam K. Mahal A. Mott R. Seller M. Bates G.P. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). In rapidly dividing bacterial and yeast cells, the rate of replication far exceeds that of transcription (7Kovtun I.V. Thornhill A.R. McMurray C.T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 3057-3068Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 29Kovtun I.V. Spiro C. McMurray C.T. Methods Mol.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5775-5783Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and the impact of transcription on deletions appears to be relevant only when cells pass through stationary phase and growth is slow (32Bowater R.P. Jaworski A. Larson J.E. Parniewski P. Wells R.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2861-2868Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Despite extensive analysis of the length and structure dependence of TNR instability during replication (reviewed in Refs. 1Mirkin S.M. Nature. 2007; 447: 932-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 3Pearson C.E. Nichol Edamura K. Cleary J.D. Nat. Rev.

Genet. 2005; 6: 743-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar), none of these existing models adequately explains why hairpins form preferentially on the template rather than the daughter strand during replication, and why 5′-CTG undergoes more deletions as the template in the lagging strand. In this report, we have addressed the underlying mechanism for orientation dependence of deletion using quantitative analyses of TNR instability. In these experiments, we have carefully controlled for effects of copying random repetitive elements. Quantitative analysis reveals previously unknown features relevant to orientation dependence of TRN deletion. TNRs present an impediment to polymerase passage. On the leading strand, 5′-CAG imposes a more severe impediment than 5′-CTG. However, SSB removes the impediment to polymerase passage on the lagging strand. Thus, the orientation dependence of deletion is driven by interaction of DNA polymerase with the 5′-CAG sequence during leading strand DNA synthesis rather than by 5′-CTG sequence during lagging strand DNA synthesis. We propose a “template-push” model in which the orientation dependence arises by a disparity in the polymerase speed and the helicase speed during leading strand synthesis. Deletion occurs in order to prevent uncoupling between the leading strand DNA polymerase and DNA helicase. These observations provide a plausible mechanism for the deletion bias associated with TNR instability and the orientation dependence of deletion during replication. DNA Plasmids and Oligonucleotides—Plasmids used for the in vivo study are listed on Fig. 1A. Triplet repeats of different lengths and sequences were inserted into a plasmid vector pcDNA3 in both orientations to generate a series of increasing long repeat tracts. Constructions are named based on sequence of the leading template. The six plasmids derived from pcDNA3 and containing a trinucleotide repeat of various sequences and lengths used for the in vitro studies are listed and described on Table 1. The plasmid pEmpty is also derived from pcDNA3 but did not contain any repetitive sequence. Constructions are named based on sequence of the template strand. Oligonucleotide sequences are listed on Table 1. Their annealing position respective to the repetitive sequence is shown on Table 1. The p867/4ps oligonucleotide contained four phosphorothioate linkages at its 5′ extremity that made it resistant to the 5′→3′ T7 exonuclease.TABLE 1Description of plasmids and oligonucleotides used in in vitro studiesView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab E. coli Strains—SURE and BL21(DE3pLysE) bacteria were from Stratagene and Novagen, respectively. Proteins—Escherichia coli single-stranded DNA-binding protein was from GE Healthcare. Sequenase Version 2.0 DNA polymerase was from USB. Herculase was from Stratagene. T7 exonuclease; N. AlwI nicking enzyme; EcoRI, NdeI, and XbaI restriction endonucleases; T7 DNA polymerase; and T4 polynucleotide kinase were from New England Biolabs. φ29 DNA polymerase was either a gift from Dr. M. Salas or purchased from New England Biolabs. The T4 DNA polymerases, gp43, 3′→5′ exonuclease deficient or proficient, the T4 single-stranded DNA-binding protein, gp32, the sliding clamp, gp45, were prepared as previously described (35Nossal N.G. Hinton D.M. Hobbs L.J. Spacciapoli P. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 560-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To remove the DNA polymerase activity that contaminated previous protein stocks, the T4 clamp loader, gp44/62 complex, was purified as described previously (35Nossal N.G. Hinton D.M. Hobbs L.J. Spacciapoli P. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 560-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. The ssDNA cellulose column was replaced by a 40-ml hydroxyapatite (HA, Hydroxyapatite Bio-Gel HTP from Bio-Rad) and a 3-ml macro-prep HighS (support from Bio-Rad) columns. Both columns were performed subsequently to the DE52 (Whatman) and P11 (Whatman) columns. The low salt HA buffer contained 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7, 2.5 mm Mg(SO4)2, 10% glycerol, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The high salt HA buffer contained 200 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7, 2.5 mm Mg(SO4)2, 10% glycerol, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The low salt macroprep HighS buffer contained 30 mm MOPS, pH 7, 1 mm Mg(SO4)2, 10% glycerol, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The high salt macroprep HighS buffer contained 30 mm MOPS, pH 7, 750 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm Mg(SO4)2, 10% glycerol, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. gp44/62 containing fractions eluted from the P11 column were dialyzed overnight against 2 liters of low salt HA buffer and loaded onto the HA column at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. Column was next washed with 40 ml of low salt HA buffer, and the gp44/62 protein complex was eluted by a 400-ml salt (20-200 mm potassium phosphate) gradient. The column was finally washed with 40 ml of high salt HA buffer. gp44/62-containing fractions were dialyzed overnight against 2 liters of low salt macroprep HighS buffer and loaded onto the macroprep HighS column at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Column was next washed with 5 ml of low salt macroprep HighS buffer, and the gp44/62 protein complex was eluted by a 25-ml salt (0-750 mm NaCl) gradient. The column was finally washed with 5 ml of high salt macroprep HighS buffer. gp44/62-containing fractions were dialyzed overnight against 1 liter of prestorage buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7, 5 mm Mg(SO4)2, 25% glycerol, 0.5 mm DTT) and for the next 24 h against 1 liter of storage buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7, 5 mm Mg(SO4)2, 50% glycerol, 0.5 mm DTT). Protein complex was at least 98% pure as judged by a gel Coomassie Brilliant Blue R staining. Protein stocks were kept at -20 °C. All protein concentrations were determined by UV absorbance at 280 nm, using molar extinction coefficients of 1.3 × 105 m-1cm-1, 1.91 × 104 m-1cm-1, 1.23 × 105 m-1cm-1, and 3.7 × 105 m-1cm-1 for monomeric gp43 (3′→5′ exonuclease deficient or proficient), monomeric gp45, gp44/62 complex, and monomeric gp32, respectively. DNA polymerase and ssDNA-binding protein concentrations are given in monomeric units, gp44/62 complex concentration is given in protein complex units (one protein complex contains four subunits of gp44 and one subunit of gp62), and gp45 concentration is given in trimeric units. Other Materials—dNTPs, ATP, and [γ-32P]ATP were from GE Healthcare. TNR Plasmids and Stability Assay in E. coli—Plasmids containing triplet repeats of different sizes were generated by overlap PCR. Oligonucleotides containing 25 triplet repeat units were denatured, reannealed, and extended using Taq polymerase. Each round of denaturation generated asymmetric pairing of the oligonucleotides, and, after extension with Taq polymerase, repeats of multiple lengths were generated. Repeats were subcloned into pcDNA3 vectors, and the resulting plasmids were used to create bacterial stocks in SURE cells (Stratagene). Only plasmids containing uninterrupted repeats were used in the analysis (Fig. 1A). The stability of repeat sequences in the plasmids was assayed after growth in culture (36Maniatis, T., Fritsch, E. F., and Sambrook, J. (1989) Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 5.68-65.71, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NYGoogle Scholar). Plasmids were isolated by cesium chloride gradients, restricted using EcoRI, and the lengths of the inserts were determined after separation in a DNA sequencing gel relative to DNA molecular weight markers. For transcription studies, plasmids of known repeat size and sequence were transformed into BL21(DE3LysE) cells. Isolated colonies were grown 18 h in 200 ml of LB in the presence or absence of 0.6 mm IPTG, and plasmids were then extracted. Plasmid yield was quantified by UV spectroscopy, and DNA was stored at -20 °C until further use. Repeat size after growth was evaluated by sizing 5′-end-labeled restriction fragments (NdeI and XbaI) containing the triplet repeat. Labeling was performed using [γ-32P]ATP. Fragments were resolved by gel electrophoresis as previously described (37Goellner G.M. Tester D. Thibodeau S. Almqvist E. Goldberg Y.P. Hayden M.R. McMurray C.T. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 60: 879-890PubMed Google Scholar). Fragments were detected using a PhosphorImager 425 (Amersham Biosciences), and deletion was quantified from digital images using IP Lab Gel software (Signal Analytics). Percent deletion was calculated by dividing the signal from the deletion products by the total signal (original insert size plus deletion products). Plasmid Sequencing—Plasmid sequencing using the Sequenase version 2.0 DNA polymerase was performed as recommended by the manufacturer (USB). Primer Extension Assay—Plasmid denaturation was performed by incubating 2.2 mg of plasmid in a denaturing solution (0.1 mg/ml plasmid, 2.3 mm EDTA, 200 mm NaOH) for 30 min at 37 °C and heating the sample for 2.5 min at 85 °C. The sample was next put on ice, and denatured plasmid was precipitated by adding EtOH and NaOAc and leaving the sample overnight at -20 °C. Precipitated plasmid was recovered by centrifugation (30 min, 4 °C, 14,000 rpm), washed with EtOH 100% and dried. Radiolabeled primer was annealed to the denatured plasmid by resuspending the denatured plasmid in 13.75 ml of primer mix (100 nm radiolabeled p821, 80 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 4 mm MgCl2) and incubating the sample at 85 °C for 1 min followed by 30 min at 37 °C. Sample was diluted two times with H2O, and each of the four dNTPs and DTT were added to a final concentration of 0.240 mm and 2.5 mm, respectively. Primer extension was initiated by adding the DNA polymerase. T4 DNA polymerases, 3′→5′-proficient and -deficient, were used at a final concentration of 35 nm and 50 nm, respectively. F29 DNA polymerase and T7 DNA polymerase were used at a final concentration of 0.5 and 8 milliunits/ml, respectively. When used, SSB proteins were allowed to coat the ssDNA by a 10-min incubation period at 37 °C before adding the DNA polymerase. E. coli SSB and T4 SSB proteins were used at a final concentration of 6 mm and 14 mm, respectively. When processive T4 DNA polymerase was used, NaCl concentration was raised to 250 mm to prevent non-processive DNA polymerase to work. ATP, gp44/62, and gp45 were added to a final concentration of 4 mm, 70 nm, and 600 nm, respectively. Samples containing DNA, gp44/62, and gp45 were incubated 5 min at 37 °C to allow clamp loading before adding the T4 wildtype DNA polymerase. In all cases, primer extension reactions proceeded at 37 °C and were quenched at various time points by adding a mixture of SDS and EDTA to a final concentration of 0.25% and 50 mm, respectively. Sample proteins were degraded by a proteinase K treatment (proteinase K at 0.67 mg/ml, 10 min at 37 °C, 10 min at 65 °C). Denaturing loading blue solution (97.5% deionized formamide, 10 mm EDTA, 0.3% bromphenol blue, 0.3% xylene cyanol-FF) was added, and samples were heated (3 min at 85 °C) before being loaded onto a 6% sequencing gel (19:1 = acrylamide:bisacrylamide mass ratio; TBE (Tris borate/EDTA) 1×;7 m urea) containing 30% formamide. The gel was run at 40 watts for 4 h, dried, and exposed on a PhosphorImager screen. The screen was scanned by using an Amersham Biosciences Storm 820 PhosphorImager, and Image-QuaNT software was used to quantify the results. Preparation of ssDNA Fragments Carrying a TNR Sequence—A PCR reaction using the adequate TNR-containing plasmid or pEmpty plasmid, the p867/4ps, and phosphorylated p1033 oligonucleotides was performed using the following program: cycle 1 (2 min at 95 °C); cycle 2 repeated 25 times (30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, and 25 s at 72 °C); cycle 3 (7 min at 70 °C); and cycle 4 (4 °C throughout reaction). Plasmid and oligonucleotides were at a final concentration of 0.2 ng/ml and 0.5 mm, respectively. Each dNTP was at a final concentration of 250 mm. Herculase DNA polymerase was used at a final concentration of 50 milliunits/ml and was added last. The reaction was done in the Herculase buffer provided by the manufacturer. The PCR product was next radiolabeled with T4 DNA polynucleotide kinase, treated with T7 exonuclease (5 min at 30 °C with 0.35 milliunit/ml enzyme for 5′-GTT53, 5′-CAG60, and random substrates and 40 min at 30 °C with 0.35 milliunit/ml enzyme for 5′-CTG60 substrate). The resulting ssDNA fragment was purified on a 5% acrylamide (29:1 = acrylamide:bisacrylamide mass ratio; TBE 1×) native gel. The band corresponding to the ssDNA was excised, eluted from the gel in TBE 1× buffer (overnight, 37 °C), precipitated and resuspended in TE buffer (Tris/EDTA) supplemented with 100 mm NaCl. Bandshift Assay—Interaction between ssDNA fragments carrying a TNR sequence or a random sequence and SSB proteins were performed in a buffer containing 40 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 4 mm DTT. Protein concentration was as indicated in the appropriate figure legends. After a 10-min incubation period at 25 °C native loading blue (5% glycerol, 0.04% bromphenol blue, 0.04% xylene cyanol-FF, 8 mm EDTA) was added to the samples. Protein-DNA complexes and DNA were separated by electrophoresis (100 V, 24 °C, 2 h) on a 3% or 10% native acrylamide (29:1 = acrylamide:bisacrylamide mass ratio; TBE 1×) gel. After electrophoresis the gel was dried and exposed on a PhosphorImager screen. The screen was scanned using a Storm 820 PhosphorImager. Preparation of a Radiolabeled Nicked 373-bp Long Double-stranded DNA Fragment—A PCR reaction on the pEmpty plasmid (p660 and p1033 oligonucleotides) was performed using the following program: cycle 1 (2 min at 95 °C); cycle 2 repeated 25 times (30 s at 95 °C, 1 min at 60 °C, 1 min at 74 °C); cycle 3 (7 min at 70 °C); cycle 4 (4 °C, throughout reaction). Plasmid and oligonucleotides were at a final concentration of 0.06 ng/ml and 0.5 mm. Each of the four dNTPs was at a final concentration of 250 mm. Herculase DNA polymerase was used at a final concentration of 50 milliunits/ml and was added last. The reaction was carried out in the Herculase buffer provided by the manufacturer. After the PCR reaction, sample was precipitated. The PCR product was purified by electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel made in TBE 1×. After electrophoresis, gel was stained by ethidium bromide, DNA band corresponding to the PCR product (373 bp) was excised, and DNA material was electro-eluted. After electro-elution, DNA was precipitated and resuspended in TE buffer. To introduce the nick, the 373-bp long PCR product was treated with the nick"
https://openalex.org/W2089147622,"RAP250 is a coactivator for nuclear receptors as well as other transcription factors. Recent studies have established RAP250 as an essential coactivator for many important biological processes, but its exact mechanism of action is not fully understood. To identify novel proteins that can associate with RAP250, we used a yeast two-hybrid system to screen cDNA libraries and identified the intracellular mediators of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) response Smad2 and Smad3 as direct interacting proteins. We show that the interaction between RAP250 and Smad2/3 is dependent upon the second LXXLL interaction motif in RAP250 and the MH2 domain in Smad2 and Smad3. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking RAP250 have reduced expression of the TGF-β target gene PAI-1 after stimulation by TGF-β when compared with wild type cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate a cross-talk between TGF-β and liver X receptors (LXR) signaling pathways and show that stimulation of cells with TGF-β and LXR agonists have a synergistic effect on the expression of the LXR target gene ABCG1. Our data identify RAP250 as a new coactivator in the TGF-β signaling pathway that binds Smad2 and Smad3. Our data also suggest that the interaction between RAP250, Smad2, and Smad3 constitutes an important bridging mechanism linking LXR and TGF-β signaling pathways."
