https://openalex.org/W2084837508,"Abscisic acid (ABA) plays an important role in environmental stress responses of higher plants during vegetative growth. One of the ABA-mediated responses is the induced expression of a large number of genes, which is mediated bycis-regulatory elements known as abscisic acid-responsive elements (ABREs). Although a number of ABRE binding transcription factors have been known, they are not specifically from vegetative tissues under induced conditions. Considering the tissue specificity of ABA signaling pathways, factors mediating ABA-dependent stress responses during vegetative growth phase may thus have been unidentified so far. Here, we report a family of ABRE binding factors isolated from young Arabidopsis plants under stress conditions. The factors, isolated by a yeast one-hybrid system using a prototypical ABRE and named as ABFs (ABREbinding factors) belong to a distinct subfamily of bZIP proteins. Binding site selection assay performed with one ABF showed that its preferred binding site is the strong ABRE, CACGTGGC. ABFs can transactivate an ABRE-containing reporter gene in yeast. Expression of ABFs is induced by ABA and various stress treatments, whereas their induction patterns are different from one another. Thus, a new family of ABRE binding factors indeed exists that have the potential to activate a large number of ABA/stress-responsive genes inArabidopsis.

Creelman R.A. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1988; 39: 439-473Crossref Google Scholar, 2.Leung J. Giraudat J. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49: 199-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar). The hormone controls several physiological processes during seed development and germination. During vegetative growth, ABA mediates responses to various adverse environmental conditions such as drought, high salt, and cold/freezing (3.Shinozaki K. Yamaguchi-Shinozaki K. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1996; 7: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 4.Thomashow M.F. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). The ABA-mediated adaptive responses to environmental stresses include stomatal closure and expression of a large number of genes involved in stress tolerance (5.Ingram J. Bartels D. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 47: 377-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (1777) Google Scholar). These and other ABA-mediated stress responses are critical to plant survival and productivity. Hence, ABA biosynthetic mutants are prone to wilting and cannot grow well even under normal, unstressed conditions. Many cis-elements known as ABA-responsive elements (ABREs) have been identified from the promoter analysis of ABA-regulated genes (reviewed in Ref. 6.Busk P.K. Pages M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 37: 425-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Among them, those sharing a (C/T)ACGTGGC consensus sequence are found to be present in numerous ABA and/or stress-regulated genes. The elements, typified by the Em1a element (GGACACGTGGC) of wheat Em gene (7.Guiltinan M.J. Marcotte W.R. Quatrano R.S. Science. 1990; 250: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar), contain the ACGT core sequence and can be considered a subset of a larger group of cis-elements known as “G-box” (CACGTG) (8.Giuliano G Pichersky E. Malik V.S. Timko M.P. Scolnik P.A. Cashmore A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7089-7093Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 9.Menkens A.E. Schindler U. Cashmore A.R. Trend Biochem Sci. 1995; 20: 506-510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). ABREs that do not contain the ACGT element are also known:e.g. “coupling element 3” (CE3) (ACGCGTGTCCTC) of barley HVA1 gene, “motif III” (GCCGCGTGGC) of rice rab16B, and a synthetic element, hex-3 (GGACGCGTGGC) (6.Busk P.K. Pages M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 37: 425-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). The sequences of these elements, which share a CGCGTG consensus, are similar to those of the former type of ABREs, except that the A of the ACGT element is replaced by G in the latter. However, the single base pair difference has been shown to be critical to the binding of plant bZIP proteins, i.e. they cannot bind to the CGCGTG element (10.Izawa T. Foster R. Chua N.-H. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 1131-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Both the G-box-like ABREs and the CGCGTG-containing ABREs, here referred to as G/ABREs and C/ABREs, respectively, are functional not only in monocotyledonus plants but also in dicot plants. Other ABREs that do not belong to the G/or C/ABREs have also been reported: a Sph element-containing sequence (CGTGTCGTCCATGCAT) of the maizeC1 gene, the MYB and the MYC binding sites of theArabidopsis rd22 gene, and an element present in theCdeT27–45 gene of Craterostigma plantagineum. In general, a single unit of ABREs is not sufficient for ABA response, and a minimal sequence unit necessary and sufficient for ABA induction is composed of various combinations of the ABREs. A number of G/ABRE-binding proteins have been reported previously. EmBP-1 and TAF-1 have been isolated based on their interaction with the Em1a and a related element, motif I of rice rab16 genes, respectively (7.Guiltinan M.J. Marcotte W.R. Quatrano R.S. Science. 1990; 250: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar, 11.Oeda K. Salinas J. Chua N.-H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1793-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). GBF3, originally identified as one of the G-box binding factors (GBFs) involved in the light regulation of a ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase gene (12.Schindler U. Menkens A.E. Beckmann H. Ecker J.R. Cashmore A.R. EMBO J. 1992; 4: 1261-1273Crossref Scopus (225) Google Scholar), has been cloned using the ABA-responsive, G-box element of an Arabidopsis Adh1 gene (13.Lu G. Paul A.-L. McCarty D.R. Ferl R.J. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 847-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Recently, a family of embryo-specific bZIP proteins has been reported that can recognize both G/ABRE and C/ABRE (14.Kim S.Y. Thomas T.L. J. Plant Physiol. 1998; 152: 607-613Crossref Google Scholar, 15.Kim S.Y. Chung H.-J. Thomas T.L. Plant J. 1997; 11: 1237-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Also, a whole array of other factors that can bind to the ACGT-containing sequences has been described (16.Foster R. Izawa T. Chua N.-H. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 192-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 17.Meshi T. Iwabuchi M. Plant Cell Physiol. 1995; 36: 1405-1420PubMed Google Scholar). Although ABRE binding factors have been known for some time and some of them are inducible by ABA (13.Lu G. Paul A.-L. McCarty D.R. Ferl R.J. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 847-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 18.Kusano T. Berberich T. Harada M. Suzuki N. Sugawara K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 248: 507-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 19.Nakagawa H. Ohmiya K. Hattori T. Plant J. 1996; 9: 217-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), several observations suggest that hitherto unidentified factors are involved in ABA-regulated gene expression during stress response, especially in vegetative tissues. ABA induction of rice rab16A and Arabidopsis rd29B genes requires de novo protein synthesis (19.Nakagawa H. Ohmiya K. Hattori T. Plant J. 1996; 9: 217-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar,20.Yamaguchi-Shinozaki K. Shinozaki K. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 251-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (1571) Google Scholar), suggesting the involvement of ABA-inducible factors. In vivo binding of ABA-inducible factors has been demonstrated in the maize rab17 gene (21.Busk P.K. Jensen A.B. Pages M. Plant J. 1997; 11: 1285-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In the case of rab16Bgene, currently unknown, C/ABRE binding factor(s) has been suggested to mediate ABA response through the motif III (22.Ono A. Izawa T. Chua N.-H. Shimamoto K. Plant Physiol. 1996; 112: 483-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Indeed, such ABA-inducible DNA-binding protein(s) has been identified in a tobacco leaf nuclear extract by in vitro binding study (23.Chung H.-J. Analysis of the 5′ Upstream Region of the Carrot Dc3 Gene: Bipartite Structure of the Dc3 Promoter for Embryo-specific and ABA-inducible Expression. Doctoral Dissertation. Texas A & M University, 1996Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been well established by genetic studies that different ABA signaling pathways operate in seeds and in vegetative tissues, respectively (2.Leung J. Giraudat J. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49: 199-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar), and tissue-specific ABRE binding activities have been demonstrated (24.Pla M. Vilardell J. Guiltinan M.J. Marcotte W.R. Niogret M.F. Quatrano R.S. Pages M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 21: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). None of the source materials used in the previous protein-DNA interaction clonings, however, were ABA- or stress-treated young plant tissues, and thus, inducible factors that may be critical for the ABA-mediated stress response during vegetative growth phase may have been missed so far. We are interested in ABA-regulated gene expression during environmental stress response and set out to isolate relevant transcription factors. Here, we report a family of ABA-inducible bZIP proteins (designated as ABFs) that can bind to both G/ABREs and C/ABREs. ABFs are also inducible by various stress treatments, and each ABF exhibited unique induction pattern, suggesting that they are probably involved in different ABA-mediated stress-signaling pathways. Arabidopsis thaliana (ecotype Columbia) was grown at 22 °C on pots of soil (a 1:1 mixture of vermiculite and peat moss) irrigated with mineral nutrient solution (0.1% Hyponex) in 8 h light/16 h dark cycles. For RNA isolation, 4–5-week-old plants were subject to various treatments, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and kept at −70 °C until needed. For ABA treatment, roots of plants were submerged after the removal of soil in a 100 μm ABA (Sigma, A 1012) solution for 4 h with gentle shaking. ABA solution was also sprayed intermittently during the incubation period. Salt treatment was performed in the same way, except that 250 mm NaCl solution was employed. For drought treatment, plants were withheld from water for 2 weeks before harvest and left on the bench after removing the soil for 1 h just before collection. For cold treatment, plants were placed at 4 °C for 24 h under dim light before harvest. Standard methods (25.Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K.

DNA sequencing was performed on ABI 310 genetic analyzer according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA sequence analysis was done with DNA Strider® and Generunr®, and BLAST algorithm (28.Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71458) Google Scholar) was used for a data base search. Multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree construction were performed with CLUSTAL W program (29.Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56003) Google Scholar) available on the web. RNA was isolated according to Chomczynski and Mackey (30.Chomczynski P. Mackey K. Biotechniques. 1995; 19: 942-945PubMed Google Scholar) and further purified by LiCl precipitation followed by ethanol precipitation. For RNA gel blot analysis, 25 μg of total RNA was fractionated on 1.1% formaldehyde-agarose gel, transferred to nylon membrane (Hybond N+, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by the “downward capillary transfer” method (25.Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Green Publishing Associates/Wiley Interscience, New York1994Google Scholar) and fixed using the Stratagene UV Crosslinker (Model 2400). Loading of equal amounts of RNAs was confirmed by ethidium bromide staining. Hybridization was at 42 °C in 5× SSC (1× SSC is 0.15m NaCl, 0.015 m sodium citrate), 5× Denhardt's solution (1× Denhardt's solution is 0.02% Ficoll, 0.02% polyvinylpyrrolidene, 0.02% bovine serum albumin), 1% SDS, 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and 50% formamide for 24–30 h. Probes were prepared from the variable regions of ABFs. After hybridization, filters were washed twice in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature and three times in 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 10 min each at 65 °C. Exposure time was 7–8 days. RT-PCR was performed employing the Access RT-PCR System (Promega) using 0.5 μg of total RNA according to the manufacturer's instruction. Amplification after the first strand cDNA synthesis was 45, 35, 40, and 45 cycles for ABF1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. ABF primers (sequences are available upon request) were from variable regions between the bZIP and the conserved regions. The actin primers used in the control reaction were from theArabidopsis actin-1 gene (accession number M20016). A lack of contaminating DNA in RNA samples was confirmed by using primer sets (ABF3 and actin) that flank introns. Poly(A)(+) RNA was isolated from total RNAs prepared from ABA- or salt-treated Arabidopsis seedlings using the Qiagen Oligotex resin. cDNA was synthesized from an equal mixture (6 μg total) of poly(A)(+) RNAs prepared from the two sources of total RNAs employing the Stratagene cDNA synthesis kit. cDNA was fractionated on a Sepharose CL-2B column, peak fractions containing cDNAs larger than 500 base pairs were pooled, and pooled cDNAs were ligated with pYESTrp2 (Invitrogen) predigested withEcoRI-XhoI. The ligation mixture was electroporated into Escherichia coli DH10B cells. The titer of this original library was 5.4 × 107 colony-forming units. Portion of the library (2 × 107) was plated on 15-cm plates at a density of 150,000 colony-forming units/plate. Cells were suspended in LB after overnight growth at 37 °C on plates and pooled together. Finally, plasmid DNA was prepared from the collected cells. pYC7-I and pSK1 (14.Kim S.Y. Thomas T.L. J. Plant Physiol. 1998; 152: 607-613Crossref Google Scholar, 15.Kim S.Y. Chung H.-J. Thomas T.L. Plant J. 1997; 11: 1237-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) were used as HIS3 andlacZ reporter plasmids, respectively. The G/ABRE reporter construct was prepared by inserting a trimer of Em1a element (GGACACGTGGCG) into the SmaI site of pYC7-I and theXbaI site of pSK1. To prepare reporter yeast, YPH 500 was transformed with the StuI-digested pYC7-I reporter construct. Resulting Ura+ colonies were transformed with the pSK1 construct and maintained on a SC-Leu-Ura medium. Screening of the library was performed as described (14.Kim S.Y. Thomas T.L. J. Plant Physiol. 1998; 152: 607-613Crossref Google Scholar) except that transformed reporter yeast was grown on Gal/Raf/CM-His-Leu-Trp plates instead of Glu/CM-His-Leu-Trp plates. Putative positive clones from the screen were streaked on fresh Gal/Raf/CM-His-Leu-Trp plates to purify colonies. After β-galactosidase assay, well-isolated single colonies were patched on Glu/CM-Leu-Trp-Ura plates to be kept as master plates. Galactose dependence of the His+/lacZ+ phenotype of the purified isolates was examined subsequently by comparing their growth pattern and β-galactosidase activity on Gal/Raf/CM-His-Leu-Trp and Glu/CM-His-Leu-Trp dropout plates. Yeast DNA was prepared from 1.5 ml of overnight cultures of the positive clones. PCR was performed with primers derived from the pYESTrp2 vector sequences flanking the inserts (pYESTrp forward and reverse primers). PCR products were digested withEcoRI, HaeIII, or AluI in order to group the cDNAs. For library plasmid rescue, yeast DNAs from representative clones were introduced into DH10B E. colicells by electroporation. Plasmid DNAs used in DNA sequencing and confirmation experiments were isolated from these E. colitransformants by the alkaline lysis method. For the confirmation experiment shown in Fig. 1, plasmid DNAs thus isolated were re-introduced into the yeast containing pSK1 or ABRE-pSK1, transformants were kept on Glu/CM-Leu-Trp plates, and their growth was tested after spotting 5 μl of overnight cultures (1/50 dilutions) on Gal/Raff/CM-His-Leu-Trp or Glu/CM-His-Leu-Trp plates containing 2.5 mm 3-aminotriazole. A PCR approach was used to isolate the missing 5′ portions of clone 11 and clone 19. A data base search revealed that clone 11 was part of the BAC clone F28A23 of the Arabidopsis chromosome IV. On the other hand, the 5′ portion of the clone 19 sequence was identical to the 3′ region of an EST clone, 176F17T7. Based on the sequence information, 5′ PCR primers (5′-GAAGCTTGATCCTCCTAGTTGTAC-3′ for clone 11 and 5′-ATTTGAACAAGGGTTTTAGG-GC-3′ for clone 19) were synthesized. 3′ primers (5′-TTACAATCACCCACAGAACCTGCC-3′ and 5′-GATTTCGTTGCCACTCTTAAG-3′, which are complementary to the 3′-most sequences of clones 11 and 19, respectively) were prepared using our sequence information. PCR was performed with Pwo polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) using the primer sets and 1 μg of our library plasmid DNA. After 30 cycles of reaction, the DNA fragments corresponding to the expected size of the full-length clones were gel-purified and cloned into the PCR-Script vector (Stratagene). Several clones from each PCR product were then sequenced in their entirety. The fidelity of the full-length sequences was confirmed by comparing their sequences with each other and with those of the original partial clones and the genomic clones deposited later by theArabidopsis Genome Initiative Project. To prepare GST-ABF fusion constructs, entire coding regions and the 3′-untranlated regions of ABF1and ABF3 were amplified by PCR using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene). After XhoI digestion followed by gel purification, the fragments were cloned into the SmaI-SalI sites of pGEX-5X-2 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The constructs used in the transactivation assay were also prepared in a similar way. The coding regions were amplified by PCR. The resulting fragments were digested with XhoI, gel-purified, and cloned into pYX243. pYX243 was prepared by NcoI digestion, Klenow fill-in reaction,SalI digestion, and gel purification. Intactness of the junction sequences was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Recombinant ABF1 and ABF3 were prepared employing a GST purification module from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech according to the supplier's instruction. E. coli BL21 cells were transformed with the GST-ABF constructs by electroporation. To prepare bacterial extract, a single colony of transformed bacteria was inoculated in 2YT/Amp medium and grown overnight. The culture was diluted (1:100) into 250 ml of fresh media. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to the culture to a final concentration of 0.1 mm whenA 600 reached 0.7. Cells were harvested by centrifugation after further growth (1.5 h). The bacterial pellet was resuspended in 12.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (0.14 mNaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10.1 mmNa2HPO4, 1.8 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.3) and sonicated on a Branson Sonifier 250 (4 × 40-s burst at setting 5 at 80% duty cycle). The lysate was cleared of cell debris by centrifugation, and the supernatant was loaded onto a column packed with 0.125 ml (bed volume) of glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin. Wash and elution was performed as suggested by the supplier. Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Production of GST-ABF1 fusion protein was confirmed by Western blotting using GST antibody. Mobility shift assay was performed as described (15.Kim S.Y. Chung H.-J. Thomas T.L. Plant J. 1997; 11: 1237-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). To prepare probes, oligonucleotide sets shown in Fig. 4 were annealed by boiling 100 pmol each of complementary oligonucleotides for 5 min and slowly cooling to room temperature. Portions of the annealed oligonucleotides (4 pmol of each set) were labeled by Klenow fill-in reaction in the presence of [32P]dATP. Binding reactions were on ice for 30 min, and electrophoresis was performed at 4 °C. A pool of 58-base oligonucleotides, R58, containing 18 bases of random sequence was synthesized: CAGTTGAGCGGATCCTGTCG(N)18GAGGCGAATTCAGTGCAACT, where N is a nucleotide. The random sequence is flanked byBamHI and EcoRI sites for the convenience of cloning after selection. R58 was made double strand by annealing a primer, RANR (AGTTGCACTGAATTCGCCTC) and then by extending it using Klenow fragment. For the first round of selection, 5 pmol of the double strand R58 (P0 probe) was mixed with 5 μg of the recombinant ABF1 in 100 μl of binding buffer (10% glycerol, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol) containing 4 μg of poly(dI-dC) and incubated on ice for 30 min. The mixture was loaded onto 0.1 ml of glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin packed on a disposable column, washed with 10 volumes of the binding buffer, and eluted with 0.3 ml of 10 mmglutathione. Bound DNA was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation. Amplification of the selected DNA was performed by PCR using 20 pmol each of RANF (CAGTTGAGCGGATCCTGTCG) and RANR primers in a buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 9.0, 50 mm KCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm MgCl2) containing 150 μmdNTP-dATP, 4 μm dATP, 10 μCi of [32P]dATP. The reaction was carried out 20 cycles (10 s, 94 °C for 10 s, 50 °C for1 min, 72 °C). Amplified DNA was purified on a polyacrylamide gel, the band was excised after autoradiography, and DNA was eluted by the standard method to be used as a probe DNA for the next round of selection. The selection cycle was repeated two more times. For the fourth and the fifth rounds of selection, bound DNA was isolated after electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) by eluting DNA from the dried gel fragment containing the shifted bands. The amplified DNA (P5 probe) from the last selection was cloned into pBluescript (Stratagene) after EcoRI andBamHI digestion, and plasmid DNAs from 50 random colonies were sequenced. Reporter yeast containing thelacZ reporter gene (pYC7-I) with or without a trimer of the Em1a element, GGACACGTGGCG, was transformed with various pYX243/ABF constructs, and transformants were kept on Glu/CM-Leu-Ura plates. For the assay, 5 colonies from each transformant group were grown in a Glu/CM-Leu-Ura medium overnight to A 600 of approximately 1. The cultures were diluted 4–6 times with fresh media, grown further for 3 h, and pelleted by brief centrifugation. The cells were washed twice with Gal/Raf/CM-Leu-Ura medium, resuspended in 4 ml of the same medium, and grown for 4 h to induce the expression of ABFs. A 600 was measured at the end of the growth period, and 0.5 ml aliquots of the culture, in duplicates, were pelleted. The pellets were resuspended in 0.665 ml of H buffer (100 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.0) and permeabilized by vortexing for 1 min after the addition of 0.055 ml each of CHCl3 and 0.1% SDS. The reaction was started by adding 0.125 ml of 40 mm stock solution of chlorophenylred-β-d-galactopyranoside, and incubation was continued at 30 °C until the color changed to red. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 0.4 ml of 1 mNa2CO3. The mixtures were microcentrifuged for 5 min to remove cell debris, and A 574 was measured. β-Galactosidase activity was expressed in Miller units. We employed a modified yeast one-hybrid system (14.Kim S.Y. Thomas T.L. J. Plant Physiol. 1998; 152: 607-613Crossref Google Scholar, 15.Kim S.Y. Chung H.-J. Thomas T.L. Plant J. 1997; 11: 1237-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) to isolate ABRE binding factor(s) using the prototypical ABRE, Em1a element (GGACACGTGGCG). A cDNA expression library representing 2 × 107colony-forming units was constructed in a yeast expression vector pYESTrp2 using a mixture of equal amounts of mRNAs isolated from ABA- and salt-treated Arabidopsis plants. The vector contains the B42 activation domain (31.Ma J. Ptashne M. Cell. 1987; 51: 113-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar) whose expression is under the control of yeast GAL1 promoter. Thus, expression of cDNAs, which are inserted as a fusion to the activation domain, is inducible by galactose and repressed by glucose. The library DNA was used to transform a reporter yeast that harbors the ABRE-containing HIS3 andlacZ reporters. From a screen of 4 million yeast transformants, ∼40 His+ blue colonies were obtained, among which 19 isolates were characterized further. Analysis of the cDNA inserts of the positive clones indicated that they could be divided into four different groups according to their restriction patterns. Representative clones with longer inserts from each group were analyzed in more detail. First, binding of the cDNA clones to the G/ABRE in yeast was confirmed. The G/ABRE-HIS3 reporter yeast was retransformed with the library plasmid DNAs isolated from the representative clones. The growth pattern of the transformants on media lacking histidine was then examined to measure the HIS3 reporter activity. The result in Fig.1 showed that transformants obtained with all four clones could grow on a galactose medium lacking histidine but not on a glucose medium. In the same assay, the transformed yeast containing a control reporter construct lacking the ABRE could not grow on the same galactose medium. Thus, the clones could activate the HIS3 reporter gene reproducibly, indicating that they bind to the ABRE in yeast. Next, nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the representative clones were determined. Clone 1, which represents two isolates, contained a cDNA insert of 1578 base pairs including a poly(A)(+) tail (GenBank™ accession number AF093544). An open reading frame (ORF) that is in-frame with the B42 domain was present within the sequence. The ORF, referred to as ABF1, contains an ATG initiation codon near the B42-cDNA junction, suggesting that it is a full-length clone. The amino acid sequence starting from the initiation codon is shown in Fig. 2. The insert of clone 2, which represents 8 isolates, is 1654 base pairs long (GenBank™ accession number AF093545), and the longest ORF including an initiation codon near the B42-cDNA junction encodes a protein of 416 amino acids (ABF2, Fig. 2). The insert of clone 11, representing 6 isolates, encoded a protein containing 434 amino acids. An ORF containing 366 amino acids was found in clone 19 cDNA. The clones were partial, however, and the missing 5′ portions were isolated using the available partial sequence information on data bases (see “Experimental Procedures”). Sequencing of the full-length clones (GenBank™ accession numberAF093546 and AF093547) showed that the original clone 11 was missing the first 20 amino acids, and thus, full-length clone 11 encodes a protein containing 454 amino acids (ABF3, Fig. 2). The longest ORF of clone 19 is composed of 431 amino acids (ABF4, Fig. 2). Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of ABF1 revealed that it has a basic region near its C terminus (Fig. 2). The region immediately downstream of it contains four heptad repeats of leucine, indicating that ABF1 is a bZIP protein (32.Landschulz W.H. Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L. Science. 1988; 240: 1759-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (2547) Google Scholar). Similarly, other ABFs also have a basic region followed by a leucine repeat region (Fig. 2). The basic regions of ABF1 and ABF3 are identical to each other, and those of ABF 2 and ABF4 are also identical. The two shared basic regions are same except that one of the lysine residues of ABF1 and ABF3 is replaced by arginine in ABF 2 and ABF4 (Fig. 2). The analysis shows that a family of bZIP proteins with conserved basic regions interacts with the G/ABRE. ABFs also share several highly conserved regions ou"

Both male and female CD9 −/− mice were born healthy and grew normally. However, the litter size from CD9 −/− females was less than 2% of that of the wild type. In vitro fertilization experiments indicated that the cause of this infertility was due to the failure of sperm-egg fusion. When sperm were injected into oocytes with assisted microfertilization techniques, however, the fertilized eggs developed to term.

The tetraspanins CD9, KAI-1/CD82, and CD63 are involved in metastasis suppression, an effect that may be related to their association with β1 integrins. Knockout mice lacking CD9 were created to evaluate the physiological importance of CD9. CD9 −/− females displayed a severe reduction of fertility.

The Sec pathway requires ATP and cpSecA, a homolog of bacterial SecA, to transport plastocyanin, OE33,1 PSI-F, and the chloroplast-encoded cytochrome f. In contrast, the Delta pH pathway uses a trans-thylakoid pH gradient as its sole energy source to transport OE23, OE17, PSII-T, and PSI-N by a mechanism that requires no soluble protein factors. An SRP pathway targets a family of nuclear-encoded integral thylakoid proteins, LHCPs.

Their homologs, SecY and SecE, are components of the well studied SecYEG translocation pore (translocon) in bacteria (15.Wickner W. Leonard M.R. J. Biol.

A maize mutant exhibiting a selective reduction in the level of proteins transported by the Delta pH system led to the identification of Hcf106 (16.Settles A.M. Yonetani A. Baron A. Bush D.R. Cline K. Martienssen R. Science. 1997; 278: 1467-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The similarity between Hcf106 and predicted proteins in Escherichia coli revealed a homologous Delta pH system in bacteria, the TAT pathway (3.Dalbey R.E. Robinson C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 17-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). A recent study by Mori et al. (17.Mori H. Summer E.J. Ma X. Cline K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) demonstrated that antibodies to cpSecY inhibited transport of Sec pathway precursors, whereas antibodies to Hcf106 and its ortholog, Tha4, blocked transport of precursors that use the Delta pH pathway. In no instance was integration of SRP-targeted LHCP affected by these antibodies, which raises the possibility that LHCP does not require a translocon for integration. Alternatively, LHCP may utilize a translocon that does not employ the function of Hcf106, Tha4, or cpSecY. Studies of protein export in mitochondria have established that the inner membrane protein, Oxa1p, is a translocase component used to integrate a subset of inner membrane proteins encoded by both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA (18.He S. Fox T.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1449-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 19.Hell K. Herrmann J. Pratje E. Neupert W. Stuart R.A.

A. 1998; 95: 2250-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). A homolog of Oxa1p in thylakoids, the albino3 protein (ALB3), was identified inArabidopsis by transposon tagging (21.Sundberg E. Slagter J.G. Fridborg I. Cleary S.P. Robinson C. Coupland G. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 717-730PubMed Google Scholar). Mutants failing to synthesize ALB3 exhibited an albino phenotype, indicating that ALB3 is required for thylakoid biogenesis. Taken together, these observations led to the suggestion that ALB3 is a candidate for the LHCP translocon (17.Mori H. Summer E.J. Ma X. Cline K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Here we show that antibody to ALB3 specifically inhibits LHCP integration without affecting transport of precursors localized by the Sec or Delta pH pathways. Our data support a model wherein the Oxa1p homolog, ALB3, is part of a thylakoid translocase distinct from the Sec or Delta pH transporters. All reagents and enzymes used were purchased commercially. Previously described plasmids were used for in vitrotranscription/translation of pLHCP (psAB80XD/4) (22.Cline K. Fulsom D.R. Viitanen P.V. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and was generously provided by Dr. Kenneth Cline, University of Florida. A cDNA clone for ALB3 was obtained by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using total RNA fromArabidopsis thaliana. Forward and reverse primers (Integrated DNA Technologies) matching the published sequence for ALB3 (21.Sundberg E. Slagter J.G. Fridborg I. Cleary S.P. Robinson C. Coupland G. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 717-730PubMed Google Scholar) were designed to include EcoRI and XbaI sites, respectively, for ligation into pGEM 4Z. The coding sequence for ALB3-50aa, a 50-amino acid segment of ALB3 beginning at PLTKQ and ending at GVNPL, was amplified by PCR and inserted in-frame behind the coding sequence for glutathione S-transferase (GST) in pGEX-6p-2 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to produce pGEX-ALB3-50aa, which codes for the fusion protein GST-ALB3-50aa. All cloned constructs were sequenced (Molecular Resource Laboratory, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR) to verify the fidelity of the PCR reaction. GST and GST-ALB3-50aa fusion protein were expressed in E. coli strain BL21 and purified by affinity to glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). GST-ALB3-50aa was subsequently used as antigen to prepare polyclonal antibodies (Cocalico Biologicals, Reamstown, PA). ALB3-50aa peptide was isolated by on-column cleavage of the GST-ALB3-50aa fusion protein with PreScission protease (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described in the manufacturer's manual, except phosphate-buffered saline (pH 8), 10 mmdithiothreitol was used as cleavage buffer. IgG was purified as described (25.Harlow E. Lane D. Using Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1988: 309-312Google Scholar) using protein A-Sepharose and stored at 4 °C in 0.54m phosphate, pH 7.0. Capped RNA was translated in the presence of [3H]leucine using a wheat germ system to produce radiolabeled precursor proteins (26.Cline K. Henry R. Li C. Yuan J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4105-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Translation products were diluted 3-fold and adjusted to import buffer (IB; 50 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 8.0, 0.33 m sorbitol) containing 30 mmunlabeled leucine. Intact chloroplasts were isolated from 9–10-day-old pea seedlings (Laxton's Progress) and used to prepare thylakoids and stromal extract (SE) (23.Henry R. Carrigan M. McCaffrey M. Ma X. Cline K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 823-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 26.Cline K. Henry R. Li C. Yuan J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4105-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Chlorophyll content was determined according to Arnon (27.Arnon D.I. Plant Physiol. 1949; 24: 1-15Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies were used to inhibit protein transport essentially as described in Mori et al. (17.Mori H. Summer E.J. Ma X. Cline K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), except that thylakoids were suspended to 1 mg/ml chlorophyll in 10 mmHepes-KOH, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2 before dilution to 0.33 mg/ml chlorophyll by the addition of 0.54 mphosphate (pH 7) containing IgG or sera. Alternatively, thylakoids were diluted with IgG that had been incubated with ALB3-50aa peptide (∼30 mol/mol IgG) for 30 min on ice. The ratio of ALB3-50aa peptide:IgG was based on the amount of ALB3-50aa peptide required to block antibody binding to pea ALB3 on Western blots. Briefly, diluted thylakoids were incubated (1 h, 4 °C) with buffer alone, sera (10% of final volume), IgG, or IgG plus ALB3-50aa peptide and washed once with IBM (10 mm MgCl2 in IB) to remove unbound antibody before resuspension in IBM to 1 mg/ml chlorophyll. Transport assays (150 μl, final), conducted at 25 °C for 30 min in light, were initiated by adding radiolabeled precursor protein (25 μl) to antibody-treated thylakoids (50 μg of chlorophyll) mixed with SE (∼0.5 mg of protein), 60 mm MgATP in IB (12.5 μl), and 25 mm NaGTP in IB (6 μl). Recovered thylakoids, post-treated with thermolysin, were dissociated with 25 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer (23.Henry R. Carrigan M. McCaffrey M. Ma X. Cline K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 823-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). A portion of each assay (10 μl) for thylakoid transport/integration was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by fluorography. Quantification was by scintillation counting of radiolabeled proteins extracted from excised gel bands (28.Cline K. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14804-14810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). IgGs were quantified using absorbance at 280 nm (25.Harlow E. Lane D. Using Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1988: 309-312Google Scholar). IgG binding to immunoblots was visualized by staining with bromochloroindolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium (25.Harlow E. Lane D. Using Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1988: 309-312Google Scholar). The concentration of ALB3 in pea chloroplasts was estimated from immunoblots using antibody binding to ALB3-50aa peptide as a standard. The concentration of purified ALB3-50aa peptide was determined by Noninterfering Protein Assay (Genotech). Low range prestained SDS-PAGE standards (Bio-Rad) were used to calculate molecular weights. Based on the sequence similarity between ALB3 and Oxa1p and the topology of Oxa1p in the inner mitochondrial membrane (20.Hell K. Herrmann J.M. Pratje E. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2250-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 29.Herrmann J.M. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2217-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), we predicted that ALB3 in thylakoids would similarly span the membrane 5 times in an Nout-Cin orientation, in which the N terminus extends into the thylakoid lumen. This model ofArabidopsis ALB3 suggests that residues 157–206 of the full-length ALB3 precursor (ALB3-50aa), located between the first and second transmembrane (TM) domains, would be exposed on the stromal thylakoid face. Antibodies directed to this region of ALB3, if added to isolated thylakoids, could bind ALB3 and act as potent inhibitors of its function in protein transport assays. Because our assays for protein transport use thylakoid membranes from pea, we could not be certain that antibodies against ALB3-50aa from Arabidopsiswould cross-react with ALB3 in pea. Therefore, it was necessary to identify pea ALB3. A BLAST search indicated that the ALB3 homolog in pea is PPF-1, the product of a cDNA isolated based on its up-regulation in apical buds following treatment with gibberellin (30.Zhu Y. Zhang Y. Luo J. Davies P.J. Ho D.T. Gene. 1998; 208: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In addition to exhibiting a high level of sequence identity toArabidopsis ALB3, radiolabeled PPF-1 was localized to the thylakoid membrane fraction following its import into isolated chloroplasts, which supports the assertion that PPF-1 is ALB3 in pea. 2M. Moore, and R. Henry, unpublished observation. The mature protein migrated in denaturing gels at a M r of ∼45,000. In the ALB3-50aa region, PPF-1 differs from Arabidopsis ALB3 by only two amino acids. ALB3-50aa, expressed as a GST-fusion protein in E. coli, was purified and used as antigen (Fig.1 A). Western blots demonstrated that the resulting antibodies recognized GST, the GST-ALB3-50aa fusion protein, and the ALB3-50aa fragment purified away from GST (Fig. 1 B, compare lanes 1–3). In addition, a single ∼45-kDa thylakoid protein was recognized in pea chloroplasts (compare lanes 4–6). Antibody binding to the 45-kDa thylakoid protein was prevented when blots were probed in the presence of purified ALB3-50aa peptide (Fig. 1 C). Hence, detection of the 45-kDa polypeptide resulted from binding of antibody to ALB3-50aa and not from binding of antibody against GST. Because mature PPF-1 is a 45-kDa protein in thylakoids, and ALB3 and PPF-1 are 96% identical in the ALB3-50aa region, we conclude that the immunoreactive protein is PPF-1. Using ALB3-50aa as a standard, we calculated that there are ∼650,000 molecules of PPF-1 per pea chloroplast. Serum directed against the GST-ALB3-50aa fusion (hereafter referred to as anti-ALB3-50aa) was used to investigate the involvement of ALB3 in thylakoid protein transport. Fig. 2 shows that preincubation of thylakoids with anti-ALB3-50aa specifically inhibited LHCP integration. Relative to assays conducted with preimmune or anti-SecY treated thylakoids, anti-ALB3-50aa reduced LHCP integration by ∼60%. In contrast, anti-ALB3-50aa had little effect on OE23 or OE33 transport when compared with preimmune-treated thylakoids. As previously reported for Sec pathway precursors, OE33 transport was sensitive to incubation of thylakoids with anti-SecY serum (14.Schuenemann D. Amin P. Hartmann E. Hoffman N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12177-12182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 17.Mori H. Summer E.J. Ma X. Cline K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), which resulted in ∼70% reduction of OE33 transport relative to thylakoids incubated with preimmune or immune ALB3-50aa sera. The level of OE23 transport, a precursor localized by the Delta pH pathway, did not differ among the three sera. IgG isolated from anti-ALB3-50aa serum was used to confirm the results obtained with sera. As shown in Fig.3 A, the efficiency of LHCP integration dropped in an antibody concentration-dependent manner, reduced to 16% at the highest concentration of IgG examined (1.0 mg/ml). Thylakoid pretreatment with anti-ALB3-50aa IgG over a wide concentration range (0.1–1.0 mg/ml IgG) had little influence on OE23 and OE33 transport, demonstrating that the inhibition was specific for LHCP. Inhibition of LHCP integration was reversed by including ALB3-50aa peptide with immune IgG during thylakoid preincubation (Fig.3 A), raising the efficiency of LHCP integration from 16% in the absence of peptide to ∼70% in the presence of peptide. A separate assay showed that when ALB3-50aa peptide was replaced with GST during thylakoid preincubation with immune IgG, inhibition of LHCP integration was not reversed (Fig. 3 B). Taken together, our data suggest that ALB3 is a thylakoid translocase component used to integrate LHCP. In this report we have used antibody to a chloroplast homolog of mitochondrial Oxa1p, ALB3, to study its potential role in thylakoid protein transport. Our results suggest a model whereby a novel post-translational SRP-based targeting system in chloroplasts is used to direct protein precursors, e.g. LHCP, to a translocon composed of or containing ALB3. Based on the mechanism of LHCP targeting to thylakoids, the exact nature of antibody inhibition is not clear. It is believed that imported LHCP, bound to cpSRP in a soluble transit complex, is the LHCP form targeted to thylakoids (9.Li X. Henry R. Yuan J. Cline K. Hoffman N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3789-3793Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 10.Schuenemann D. Gupta S. Persello-Cartieaux F. Klimyuk V.I. Jones J.D.G. Nussaume L. Hoffman N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10312-10316Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). LHCP integration requires the function of an SRP receptor homolog, cpFtsY (11.Tu C.J. Schuenemann D. Hoffman N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27219-27224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 12.Kogata N. Nishio K. Hirohashi T. Kikuchi S. Nakai M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 447: 329-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), which is partitioned between the stroma and thylakoid membrane (11.Tu C.J. Schuenemann D. Hoffman N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27219-27224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). It is possible that recruitment of cpFtsY to thylakoids relies on a cpFtsY-binding protein at the membrane, possibly ALB3 or a protein closely associated with ALB3. In this context, anti-ALB3-50aa could act to block cpFtsY binding to the thylakoid, resulting in a loss of LHCP integration. However, preliminary data indicate that ALB3 antibody does not inhibit cpFtsY binding to thylakoids. 3M. Moore, E. Peterson, and R. Henry, unpublished observation. Therefore, anti-ALB3-50aa most likely blocks LHCP binding to an ALB3 translocon or prevents ALB3 function in the LHCP integration reaction. The involvement of ALB3 in LHCP integration suggests that integration of LHCP into thylakoids may closely resemble Oxa1p-dependent integration of proteins into the inner mitochondrial membrane. In mitochondria, Oxa1p is used to transport N- and C-terminal tails from the matrix to the intermembrane space and also to mediate the insertion of TM domains into the membrane in a pairwise fashion, which results in the export of connecting regions between TM domains (18.He S. Fox T.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1449-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 19.Hell K. Herrmann J. Pratje E. Neupert W. Stuart R.A.

LHCP contains three TM domains in an Nin-Cout topology (31.Kuhlbrandt W. Wang D.N. Fujiyoshi Y. Nature. 1994; 367: 614-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1525) Google Scholar). Integration requires transport of a short C-terminal tail and a 33-amino acid loop between TM domains 1 and 2. By analogy to Oxa1p function (29.Herrmann J.M. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2217-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), the thylakoid ALB3 translocase may insert TM 1 and TM 2 in a pairwise manner and transport the C-terminal tail as a separate translocation event, a model that we are currently testing. In addition to the post-translational SRP targeting system used to route LHCP, cpSRP also appears to function in co-translational targeting of integral thylakoid proteins, e.g. the D1 protein of photosystem II (32.Nilsson R. Brunner J. Hoffman N.E. van Wijk K.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 733-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The identity of translocation components used to integrate proteins targeted by the co-translational SRP pathway is unknown. In E. coli, where SRP-based targeting is exclusively co-translational (6.Rapoport T.A. Jungnickel B. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 271-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar), SRP dependence is not correlated with the use of a specific translocon. For example, SRP-targeted FtsQ (33.Scotti P.A. Valent Q.A. Manting E.H. Urbanus M.L. Driessen A.J. Oudega B. Luirink J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29883-29888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and mannitol permease (34.Koch H.G. Hengelage T. Neumann-Haefelin C. MacFarlane J. Hoffschulte H.K. Schimz K.L. Mechler B. Muller M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2163-2173Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) require the function of a SecYEG translocon for integration, whereas integration of a ProW derivative, which proceeds by an N-terminal tail transport mechanism, takes place in the absence of a functional Sec translocase (35.Cristobal S. Scotti P. Luirink J. von Heijne G. de Gier J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20068-20070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). These results indicate that translocon usage in E. coli is not linked to SRP dependence. Rather, elements in the SRP-targeted protein are used to specify the translocon. If cpSRP is similarly used to localize proteins to other translocons in the thylakoid,e.g. the Sec or Delta pH transporters, then it is likely that elements in LHCP are required to target LHCP to the ALB3 translocase in thylakoids. We are grateful to Kenneth Cline for antibody to cpSecY, to Alicia Kight for excellent technical assistance, and to Mack Ivey and Doug Rhoads for careful reading of the manuscript."

Here, the expression of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class Ib T22 and the closely related T10 molecules is shown to be activation-induced, and they confer specificity to about 0.4% of the gammadelta T cells in normal mice. Thus, the increased expression of T22 and/or T10 might trigger immunoregulatory gammadelta T cells during immune responses. Furthermore, the fast on-rates and slow off-rates that characterize this receptor/ligand interaction would compensate for the low ligand stability and suggest a high threshold for gammadelta T cell activation."

Govers R. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3806-3812Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). In particular, a 10-amino acid motif including Phe-327 within the GHR cytosolic tail (the UbE motif) is involved in both GHR ubiquitination and ligand-induced receptor endocytosis.

However, it has been suggested that the GHR is also transported to the nucleus (7.Lobie P.E. Wood T.J.J. Chen C.M. Waters M.J. Norstedt G. J. Biol.

This dimerization induces recruitment and binding of the tyrosine kinase JAK2, resulting in the activation of various signal transduction pathways (reviewed in Ref. 11.Carter Su C. Smit L.S. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1998; 53: 61-83PubMed Google Scholar). The GHR was initially found to be ubiquitinated upon amino acid sequencing of the receptor from rabbit liver (12.Leung D.W. Spencer S.A.

Degradation of cytosolic proteins is mainly carried out by the 26 S proteasome. The ubiquitin conjugation system selects and targets the proteins for proteasomal degradation (15.Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6907) Google Scholar).

Down-regulation of signal transducing membrane receptors is a part of the highly programmed cascade of events leading both to extinction of the signaling pathway(s) and to rapid degradation of the primary messengers, the receptor and its ligand (5.Roupas P.

Chem. 1997; 272: 11128-11132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In the absence of ligand the half-life of GHR is approximately 1–2 h depending on the cell system used. The assumption is that this is mainly due to a proteolytic cleavage in the extracellular domain of the GHR resulting in soluble GH-binding proteins (30.Baumann G. Stolar M.W. Amburn K. Barasano C.P. deVries B.C. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1986; 62: 134-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar); the fate of the cytosolic tail in this process is unknown. If ligand is present, a completely different scenario follows; two GHR polypeptides dimerize, they are phosphorylated by the tyrosine kinase JAK2 and ubiquitinated, and the complex is then endocytosed. As the ubiquitin conjugation system acts generally in concert with the 26 S proteasome, we examined the effect of proteasomal inhibitors on GH uptake via wild-type GHR and a receptor truncated at amino acid residue 369 in CHO-ts20 cells (1.Strous G.J. van Kerkhof P. Govers R. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3806-3812Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The data show that specific proteasomal inhibitors block GH uptake via the full-length GHR, whereas a truncated receptor can endocytose undisturbed. Nonetheless, the ubiquitin conjugation system remains necessary for the truncated receptor to be endocytosed (14.Govers R. van Kerkhof P. Schwartz A.L. Strous G.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4851-4858Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Evidence is provided that proteasomal action does not require ubiquitination of the receptor itself. A polyclonal antibody to the cytosolic tail was raised in rabbits against the membrane-proximal amino acid residues 271–318 (anti-T) (see Fig. 1) as described in Ref. 1.Strous G.J. van Kerkhof P. Govers R. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3806-3812Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar; antibody (Mab5) recognizing the luminal part of the GHR was from AGEN Inc., Parsippany, NJ. Antiserum specific for protein-ubiquitin conjugates was a generous gift from Dr. A. Ciechanover (Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel). CHO-ts20 was transfected with both the full-length rabbit GHR cDNA sequence and a cDNA encoding GHR truncation 1–369 (1.Strous G.J. van Kerkhof P. Govers R. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3806-3812Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 13.Kulka R.G. Raboy B. Schuster R. Parag H.A. Diamond G. Ciechanover A. Marcus M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15726-15731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 10 mm sodium butyrate was added to the cells 18 h before use to increase GHR expression (14.Govers R. van Kerkhof P. Schwartz A.L. Strous G.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4851-4858Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). cDNA encoding GHR truncation mutant GHR1–369 was constructed by introducing a stop codon at the proper position within the GHR cDNA. For this GHR truncation, a polymerase chain reaction was performed using a 5′-oligonucleotide containing a NcoI restriction site corresponding to the NcoI site in the cDNA of the transmembrane region of the GHR together with a 3′-oligonucleotide containing a KpnI restriction site, a stop codon, and overlapping sequences at position 369 within the cDNA, encoding the intracellular domain of the GHR. The polymerase chain reaction product was cut by NcoI and KpnI and ligated into a PGEM3Z-GHR construct. The truncated GHR cDNA (see Fig. 1) was subcloned into the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). cDNA of mutants GHR F327A and GHR1–399 K271-362R were constructed as described (2.Govers R. ten Broeke T. van Kerkhof P. Schwartz A.L. Strous G.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar,14.Govers R. van Kerkhof P. Schwartz A.L. Strous G.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4851-4858Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). 125I-human GH was prepared using chloramine T (1.Strous G.J. van Kerkhof P. Govers R. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3806-3812Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). For internalization studies, cells were grown in 35-mm dishes, washed with MEMα supplemented with 20 mm Hepes and 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and incubated for 1 h at 30 °C in MEMα/Hepes. 125I-GH (8 nm) was bound on ice for 120 min in the absence or presence of excess unlabeled GH, and the cells were washed free of unbound GH and incubated for 0–30 min at 30 °C. If indicated, lactacystin (20 μm) or its β-lactone (20 μm), MG132 (20 μm), and carboxybenzylleucyl-leucyl-leucinevinylsulfone (20 μm), dissolved in either ethanol or dimethyl sulfoxide, or vehicle only were added 1 h before the start of the experiment. Membrane-associated GH was removed by acid wash (0.15m NaCl, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.05 mglycine, pH 2.5), and internalized GH was determined by measuring the radioactivity after solubilization of the acid-treated cells by 1m NaOH. For metabolic labeling, the cells were incubated in methionine-free MEM for 20 min and then [35S]methionine (Tran-35S Label™, 1.85 MBq/ml, 40 TBq/mmol, ICN Biomedicals, Costa Mesa, CA) was added and the incubation was continued for 20 min; the radioactivity was chased in the presence of MEMα containing 0.05 mm unlabeled methionine, 0.18 μg/ml GH, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and the appropriate proteasomal inhibitor. Cells were lysed in boiling buffer (see below). The radioactivity was determined using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. At the end of the incubation, cells were washed and immediately lysed in boiling buffer containing 1% SDS in PBS. We used this protocol for all of our experiments to ascertain that no GHR or the derived degradation products were lost because of poor solubility of GH·GHR complexes, as reported by Goldsmith et al. (8.Goldsmith J.F. Lee S.J. Jiang J. Frank S.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 36: E932-E941Google Scholar). Equal aliquots of the cell extracts were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting as described (14.Govers R. van Kerkhof P. Schwartz A.L. Strous G.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4851-4858Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). For detection we used the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immunoprecipitations were performed as described previously (1.Strous G.J. van Kerkhof P. Govers R. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3806-3812Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Extracts from cells lysed in boiling buffer were subjected to immunoprecipitation in PBS containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% SDS, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2 μm MG132. The lysates were incubated with anti-ubiquitin or anti-GHR antiserum as indicated in the experiments represented in the figures for 2 h on ice. Immune complexes were isolated by the use of protein A-agarose beads (Repligen Co., Cambridge, MA). Cy3-GH and Cy3-transferrin were prepared using a FluoroLink Cy3 label kit according to the supplier's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cells grown on coverslips were incubated for 60 min in MEMα supplemented with 20 mm Hepes at 30 °C and for 30 min with Cy3-GH (1 μg/ml) or Cy3-transferrin (20 μg/ml). Cells were washed with PBS to remove unbound label and fixed for two h in 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Confocal laser scanning microscopy was performed using a Leica TCS 4D system. Initially, we investigated the life cycle of the GHR at the permissive temperature (30 °C) in the presence of GH in CHO-ts20 cells transfected with GHR cDNA using pulse-chase labeling with [35S]methionine (see Fig. 2 A). The receptor is synthesized as a 110-kDa glycoprotein precursor (double band) and, upon “complex glycosylation” in the Golgi complex, converted to a 130-kDa mature species. The nature of the double band is unknown. Mature GHR was detectable by 20 min of chase and was maximal at 80 min, after which rapid degradation occurred. When the pulse-chase was performed in the presence of the specific proteasomal inhibitors MG132 or the more membrane permeable β-lactone analogue of lactacystin (31.Bogyo M. McMaster J.S. Gaczynska M. Tortorella D. Goldberg A.L. Ploegh H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6629-6634Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 32.Craiu A. Gaczynska M. Akopian T. Gramm C.F. Fenteany G. Goldberg A.L. Rock K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13437-13445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), the amount of labeled mature GHR was hardly decreased after 160 min of chase. Both inhibitors did not affect the endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi transport, as is concluded from the kinetics by which the GHR precursor is converted to the mature GHR. When the experiment was performed with a cell line expressing the GHR with the cytosolic tail truncated after amino acid residue 369 (GHR1–369, Fig.1), basically the same results were obtained (Fig. 2 B). In the presence of clasto-lactacystin β-lactone the amount of GHR1-369 that became mature after 80 min was diminished, but the kinetics of degradation between 80 and 160 min of chase were similar to the results with MG132. These results demonstrate that the mature GHR has a relatively short half-life and that the proteasome plays an important role in GH-induced degradation. Ligand-induced endocytosis of the growth hormone receptor occurs only if the ubiquitin conjugation system is functional. An issue is thus whether at the same time proteasomal action is required. To test this we used the GHR-transfected CHO-ts20 cells expressing approximately 106 ligand-binding sites per cell (14.Govers R. van Kerkhof P. Schwartz A.L. Strous G.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4851-4858Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Incubation for 30 min in the presence of Cy3-labeled GH resulted in abundant fluorescent label in endosomal and lysosomal compartments (Fig. 3 A). If the cells were treated with MG132 (Fig. 3 D) or lactacystin (Fig.3 G) little label was present intracellularly. The same results were obtained when the cells were treated with carboxybenzyl-leucyl-leucyl-leucyl vinylsulfone or clasto-lactacystin β-lactone (not shown). To ascertain that these proteasomal inhibitors did not cause pleiotropic effects on the receptor-mediated endocytic machinery we used Cy3-labeled transferrin under identical conditions (Fig. 3, C, F, and I); no inhibition of transferrin uptake was observed. We next addressed the question as to whether the proteasome acts directly or indirectly on the GHR. Experiments with Chinese hamster cells expressing a GHR1–369 show that the same proteasomal inhibitors as used for the full-length GHR do not affect GH endocytosis (Fig. 3, B, E, and H). Thus, removal of a portion of the cytosolic tail is sufficient to uncouple proteasomal action and GH-dependent endocytosis. To confirm and quantify the effect of the proteasomal inhibitors we measured the uptake of 125I-GH in kinetic experiments (Fig.4). Cells were pre-treated with the inhibitors, 125I-GH was bound on ice, and cells were incubated at 30 °C for various periods of time. After cooling to 0 °C and washing the cells at a low pH value to remove label from the cell surface, uptake was determined. Again, GH uptake was inhibited by MG132. To avoid secondary effects such as receptor recycling and/or early ligand degradation, we measured the initial uptake kinetics. To ascertain the involvement of proteasomes in this process we used several other proteasomal inhibitors; lactacystin reduced the uptake somewhat less effectively, probably because of its poor cell-permeant properties, whereas clasto-lactacystin β-lactone was almost as effective as MG132 (Fig. 4, lower panel). As expected, uptake via the GHR1–369 was not affected by the proteasomal inhibitors. It was also observed that the truncated receptor is internalized much more rapidly than the full-length GHR. To determine background uptake values we used the full-length GHR in which the Phe-327 was mutated to alanine. This mutation abolishes the ubiquitin-dependent uptake of GH. As seen in Fig. 4(GHR-F327A), this receptor shows a low GH uptake that was not further decreased in the presence of MG132. The level of GH uptake via the GHR F327A mutant is similar to that via the wild-type GHR in the presence of MG132, indicating that proteasomal inhibitors affect the ubiquitin system-dependent GH uptake. These results show that ubiquitin system-dependent uptake via the full-length receptor is fully blocked in the presence of proteasomal inhibitors. To investigate the role of ubiquitination in the proteasome-dependent endocytosis of the GHR, we addressed whether ubiquitination of the receptor was required. We constructed a GHR in which all cytoplasmic lysine residues were mutated to arginines. Because internalization of ligand by GHR1–399 is as dependent on an intact ubiquitin conjugation system as the wild-type GHR, we used a construct for these experiments in which all 10 cytoplasmic lysine residues were mutated (GHR1–399, K271-362R) (18.Hein C. Andre B. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 607-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Both truncations endocytose GH in an ubiquitin system-dependent fashion (2.Govers R. ten Broeke T. van Kerkhof P. Schwartz A.L. Strous G.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 shows that MG132 does inhibit ligand uptake for the GHR1–399. In addition it shows that, even if the GHR tail does not contain attachment sites for ubiquitin, endocytosis is inhibited by the proteasomal inhibitor. To quantify the fluorescence experiments 125I-GH uptake was measured in these cells in the presence and absence of the proteasomal inhibitor MG132. Although the inhibitory effect of MG132 is less than for the full-length GHR, it is clear that MG132 inhibits ligand uptake (Fig.6). An important difference between GH-uptake by the full-length and the truncated GHR is that the initial rate of uptake is higher as the cytosolic tail is shorter. This is certainly the case for truncations up to the di-leucine motif at position 349 (33.Govers R. van Kerkhof P. Schwartz A.L. Strous G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16426-16433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). An explanation is still nonexistent. To show that ubiquitin attachment is indeed absent, we immunoprecipitated the two truncated GHRs with an antiserum against ubiquitin after stimulation with GH for 30 min and detected the blots with anti GHR. As seen in Fig. 7, GH induces a strong increase in the amount of ubiquitinated GHR1–399, whereas no signal is detectable for the lysine-less GHR1–399. The amounts of mature receptors in both cell lines is approximately the same, as shown in Fig. 7 (right panel), in which cell lysates were immunoblotted with anti-GHR (anti-T). These results allow two conclusions: 1) the inhibitory effect of proteasomal inhibitors resides in a 30-amino acid segment between amino acid residues 369 and 399, and 2) ubiquitination of the (truncated) GHR is not required for the proteasome-dependent GHR internalization.Figure 6Quantitation of GH-uptake by lysine-less GHR.

Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6907) Google Scholar). At the cytosolic face of the endoplasmic reticulum the ubiquitin/proteasome system is involved in degradation of misfolded endoplasmic reticulum proteins (34.Wiertz E.J. Jones T.R. Sun L. Bogyo M. Geuze H.J. Ploegh H.L. Cell. 1996; 84: 769-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar, 35.Hiller M.M. Finger A. Schweiger M. Wolf D.H. Science. 1996; 273: 1725-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Previously, we have shown that GHR endocytosis requires an intact ubiquitin system and that GH internalization is accompanied by GHR ubiquitination (1.Strous G.J. van Kerkhof P. Govers R. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3806-3812Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 14.Govers R. van Kerkhof P. Schwartz A.L. Strous G.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4851-4858Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Endocytosis of the GHR occurs via clathrin-coated pits (28.Lesniak M.A. Roth J. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 3720-3729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This process requires interaction between adapter proteins such as AP2 or β-arrestin and clathrin as well as endocytosis motifs within the cytosolic tail of membrane proteins. The tyrosine-based motif YXXφ (where X is any amino acid andφ is an amino acid with a bulky hydrophobic group) is involved in the endocytosis of many transmembrane proteins such as the receptors for low density lipoprotein, transferrin, and asialoglycoproteins (36.Chen W.-J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3116-3123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37.Collawn J.F. Stangel M. Kuhn L.A. Esekogwu V. Jing S.Q. Trowbridge I.S. Tainer J.A.

Internalization of the insulin and β2-adrenergic receptors is mediated by the di-leucine endocytosis motif (39.Haft C.R. Sierra N.D.L. Hamer I. Carpentier J.L. Taylor I. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1618-1629Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 40.Goodman O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J. Benovic J.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar). GHR contains an endocytosis-competent di-leucine motif (DTDRLL), but this acts only if the receptor is truncated immediately after the motif (33.Govers R. van Kerkhof P. Schwartz A.L. Strous G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16426-16433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Moreover, ligand-induced GHR endocytosis fully depends on the UbE motif (2.Govers R. ten Broeke T. van Kerkhof P. Schwartz A.L. Strous G.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Herein we present evidence that proteasomal action is required for receptor down-regulation in addition to the ubiquitin system and the clathrin-coated pit machinery. What is the substrate for the proteasome? The most obvious target is the GHR tail itself. This is indicated by the fact that a GHR truncated at position 369 can enter the cells if proteasomal action is blocked. In this scenario the GHR can only be recognized by the endocytic machinery if the tail is cut. In favor of this idea is the fact that attempts to detect full-length GHR intracellularly failed (not shown). Another possibility is that the GHR binds, via the amino acid sequence 369–399, to a factor that has to be removed by the proteasome before endocytosis can proceed. This would explain why ubiquitination of the GHR per se is not required. The amino acid sequence starting at amino acid 365 (DSGRTS) is homologous to an amino acid sequence of human immunodeficiency virus, type I-encoded gene, the membrane protein Vpu. Vpu is a target for the ubiquitin system in the rough endoplasmic reticulum and acts as an intermediary in the degradation of CD4 (41.Margottin F. Bour S.P. Durand H. Selig L. Benichou S. Richard V. Thomas D. Strebel K. Benarous R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 565-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). In the truncated receptor GHR1–369 this motif is disrupted, which would provide a third possible scenario: the F-box protein βTrCP or an analogous protein would bind via its WD40 domain to the motif in the full-length receptor, after which proteasomal action could start. Whatever scenario is correct, it is unlikely that the proteasome truncates the receptor beyond residue 334, because this would disable the UbE motif and prevent endocytosis (14.Govers R. van Kerkhof P. Schwartz A.L. Strous G.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4851-4858Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination of the GHR is not required for proteasomal action. This phenomenon was reported before for GHR endocytosis via the UbE motif. If truncated receptors like GHR1–369 and GHR1–334 are used endocytosis still depends on an active ubiquitin conjugation system, but their ubiquitination is not required (2.Govers R. ten Broeke T. van Kerkhof P. Schwartz A.L. Strous G.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Moreover, proteasomal inhibitors do not affect GH uptake via these short GHRs (Fig. 4 and data not shown). Thus, both proteasomal action and UbE-induced events precede endocytosis (i.e. selection into the coated pits and coated vesicle formation). Collectively, the data indicate that the action of proteasomes precedes the events directed via the UbE motif, although it cannot be excluded that the latter might control the action of the proteasome. For both events, ubiquitination of the GHR tail is not required. A possible explanation is that the ubiquitin ligases involved contain ubiquitin-like proteins as reported for the E3 that is involved in von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor function (42.Liakopoulos D. Busgen T. Brychzy A. Jentsch S. Pause A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5510-5515Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Once established that proteasomal inhibitors prevent endocytosis, it is not surprising that the half-life of the GHR is prolonged under such conditions. Previously we and others have shown that the GHR and its ligand are degraded within the lysosome (1.Strous G.J. van Kerkhof P. Govers R. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3806-3812Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 3.Murphy L.J. Lazarus L. Endocrinology. 1984; 115: 1625-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 6.Yamada K. Lipson K.E. Donner D.B. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4438-4443Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This is certainly the case for the luminal domain of the receptor. Our present data strongly suggest that at least a portion of the GHR is a target for the proteasome system. It has been proposed that the lysosomal and the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway may cooperate in degrading some tyrosine kinase receptors (23.Mori S. Tanaka K. Omura S. Saito Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29447-29452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Proteasomal action has been reported to be involved in the turnover of other receptors like the Met tyrosine kinase receptor (22.Jeffers M. Taylor G.A. Weidner K.M. Omura S. Vandewoude G.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 799-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), the platelet-derived growth factor-β receptor (43.Mori S. Kanaki H. Tanaka K. Morisaki N. Saito Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 217: 224-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), the low density lipoprotein receptor (24.Miura H. Tomoda H. Miura K. Takishima K. Omura S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 227: 684-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and the mannose phosphate receptor (25.Breuer P. Braulke T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33254-33258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Endocytosis of the latter three receptors is not dependent on the ubiquitin/proteasome system. More similarities exist between the degradation of the Met tyrosine kinase receptor and the GHR. Like the GHR, the Met tyrosine kinase receptor undergoes a ligand-independent proteolytic cleavage in its extracellular domain (44.Harrison S.M. Barnard R. Ho K.Y. Rajkovic I. Waters M.J. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 651-659Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the receptor is ubiquitinated upon ligand binding (22.Jeffers M. Taylor G.A. Weidner K.M. Omura S. Vandewoude G.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 799-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Our observation that specific proteasomal inhibitors inhibit degradation of wild-type GHR (at the cell surface) and truncated GHR1-369 (at the cell surface and in endosomes) suggests that the proteasome inhibitors affect both endocytosis and membrane sorting to the lysosomes. One striking difference between the two receptors is that ubiquitination of the Met receptor is increased in the presence of proteasomal inhibitors, whereas ubiquitination of the GHR is decreased under all conditions that block its endocytosis (14.Govers R. van Kerkhof P. Schwartz A.L. Strous G.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4851-4858Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), including proteasomal inhibitors (not shown). As the Met tyrosine kinase receptor lacks the UbE motif that is instrumental in ubiquitin-dependent GHR endocytosis, it is tempting to speculate that stabilization of the Met tyrosine kinase receptor by proteasomal inhibitors is due to an intracellular block e.g. in a membrane-sorting step en route to the lysosomes, analogous to the mechanism that connects cbl to the degradation of epidermal growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor receptors (45.Levkowitz G.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7927-7932Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Although the present findings apply to the GHR, there are indications that the ubiquitin/proteasome system is involved in regulation of the residence time at the cell surface of other membrane proteins as well. The residence time of the sodium channel protein ENaC is regulated by the ubiquitin system (47.Staub O. Gautschi I. Ishikawa T. Breitschopf K. Ciechanover A. Schild L. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6325-6336Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Many signaling membrane receptorse.g. the Met tyrosine kinase receptor (22.Jeffers M. Taylor G.A. Weidner K.M. Omura S. Vandewoude G.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 799-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), the TCR ζ-chain (48.Hou D. Cenciarelli C. Jensen J.P. Nguyen H.B. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14244-14247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the c-Kit receptor (49.Miyazawa K. Toyama K. Gotoh A. Hendrie P.C. Mantel C. Broxmeyer H.E. Blood. 1994; 83: 137-145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), epidermal growth factor receptor (50.Galcheva Gargova Z. Theroux S.J. Davis R.J. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2649-2655PubMed Google Scholar), and prolactin receptor (51.Cahoreau C. Garnier L. Djiane J. Devauchelle G. Cerutti M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 350: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) are all ubiquitinated upon activation. Thus, the ubiquitin/proteasome system may set the timer for cell surface residency and life time for a selected number of key regulatory cell surface molecules. We thank Drs. Alan Schwartz and Guojun Bu for stimulating discussions, Dr. Hidde Ploegh for the proteasomal inhibitors, Dr. William Wood (Genentech) for kindly providing the GHR cDNA, and Eli Lilly for the kind gift of GH."

A potential mechanism for the development of carnitine deficiency is competition between cephaloridine and carnitine for the renal reabsorptive process. OCTN2 is an organic cation/carnitine transporter that is responsible for Na+-coupled transport of carnitine in the kidney and other tissues. We investigated the interaction of several β-lactam antibiotics with OCTN2 using human cell lines that express the transporter constitutively as well as using cloned human and rat OCTN2s expressed heterologously in human cell lines. The β-lactam antibiotics cephaloridine, cefoselis, cefepime, and cefluprenam were found to inhibit OCTN2-mediated carnitine transport. These antibiotics possess a quaternary nitrogen as does carnitine. Several other β-lactam antibiotics that do not possess this structural feature did not interact with OCTN2. The interaction of cephaloridine with OCTN2 is competitive with respect to carnitine. Interestingly, many of the β-lactam antibiotics that were not recognized by OCTN2 were good substrates for the H+-coupled peptide transporters PEPT1 and PEPT2. In contrast, cephaloridine, cefoselis, cefepime, and cefluprenam, which were recognized by OCTN2, did not interact with PEPT1 and PEPT2. The interaction of cephaloridine with OCTN2 was Na+-dependent, whereas the interaction of cefoselis and cefepime with OCTN2 was largely Na+-independent. Furthermore, the Na+-dependent, OCTN2-mediated cellular uptake of cephaloridine could be demonstrated by direct uptake measurements. These studies show that OCTN2 plays a crucial role in the pharmacokinetics and therapeutic efficacy of certain β-lactam antibiotics such as cephaloridine and that cephaloridine-induced carnitine deficiency is likely to be due to inhibition of carnitine reabsorption in the kidney.

Gorboulev V. Arndt P. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 167: 103-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The ability to transport a wide variety of structurally diverse organic cations is a common characteristic of the transporters belonging to this family. However, OCTN2 is unique because it can mediate the transport of not only organic cations but also the zwitterions carnitine and acylcarnitines (2.Wu X. Prasad P.D. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 3.Tamai I. Ohashi R. Nezu J. Yabuuchi H. Oku A. Shimane M. Sai Y. Tsuji A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20378-20382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the transport of organic cations by OCTN2 is Na+-independent, whereas the transport of carnitine and acylcarnitine by the same transporter is Na+-dependent (4.Wu X. Huang W.

Thus, OCTN2 is an organic cation/carnitine transporter. This characteristic is seen with OCTN2 from different animal species (4.Wu X. Huang W. Prasad P.D. Seth P. Rajan D.P. Leibach F.H. Chen J. Conway S.J. Ganapathy V. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 290: 1482-1492PubMed Google Scholar). Carnitine is an endogenous compound with an obligatory role in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. It has been known for several years that cellular uptake of carnitine is mediated by a Na+-dependent, high affinity transporter located in the plasma membrane (5.Stanley C.A. Adv. Pediatr. 1995; 42: 209-242PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Kerner J. Hoppel C. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1998; 18: 179-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This transport mechanism is also responsible for reabsorption of filtered carnitine in the kidney. Genetic defects in this transport system cause primary carnitine deficiency associated with very low levels of carnitine in the circulation resulting from the inability of the kidney to reabsorb filtered carnitine (5.Stanley C.A. Adv. Pediatr. 1995; 42: 209-242PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Kerner J. Hoppel C. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1998; 18: 179-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The clinical symptoms of this disease include cardiac myopathy and skeletal myopathy. Available evidence indicates that OCTN2 is responsible for this Na+-dependent high affinity carnitine transport in the plasma membrane of various tissues including the kidney, heart, and skeletal muscle (2.Wu X.

This antibiotic contains a quaternary nitrogen and exists as a zwitterion under physiological conditions. Therapeutic use of cephaloridine has been found to be associated with nephrotoxicity (12.Tune B.M. Fravert D. Kidney Int. 1980; 18: 591-600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 13.Tune B.M. Hook J.B. Goldstein R.S. Toxicology of the Kidney. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1993: 257-281Google Scholar). Studies on the mechanisms of cephaloridine-induced nephrotoxicity have shown that cephaloridine interferes with carnitine-dependent fatty acid oxidation in mitochondria (14.Tune B.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 562-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 15.Tune B.M. Hsu C.Y. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 270: 873-880PubMed Google Scholar). These studies have also shown that cephaloridine increases fractional renal excretion of carnitine, suggesting that this antibiotic may interfere with the reabsorption of carnitine in the kidney (14.Tune B.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 562-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 15.Tune B.M. Hsu C.Y. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 270: 873-880PubMed Google Scholar). The present work was undertaken to identify the cellular mechanism responsible for enhanced renal excretion of carnitine during cephaloridine therapy. The Na+-dependent high affinity carnitine transporter is a potential target for cephaloridine. The present studies were therefore designed to investigate the interaction of cephaloridine as well as a variety of other β-lactam antibiotics with the carnitine transporter using cell lines which express the transporter constitutively and also using the cloned carnitine transporter OCTN2 following its heterologous expression in mammalian cells. The results of these studies show that cephaloridine and other β-lactam antibiotics that contain a quaternary nitrogen interact with the carnitine transporter and compete with carnitine for the transporter process. These studies also suggest that OCTN2 may play a role in the intestinal and renal absorption as well as in the cellular uptake in other tissues of these antibiotics. l-[3H]Carnitine (specific radioactivity, 65 Ci/mmol), acetyl-l-[3H]carnitine (specific radioactivity, 65 Ci/mmol), and propionyl-l-[3H]carnitine (specific radioactivity, 65 Ci/mmol) were obtained from Moravek Biochemicals, Inc.

HeLa cells (a human cervical cancer cell line) and JAR cells (a human placental choriocarcinoma cell line) were originally obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). The human proximal convoluted tubule (HPCT) epithelial cell line was kindly provided by Dr. Ulrich Hopfer (Case Western University, Cleveland, OH). Cell culture media were from either Mediatech Inc. (Herndon, VA) or Life Technologies, Inc. Lipofectin was obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Most of the β-lactam antibiotics and other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. The JAR cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). The HPCT cells were cultured in ketatinocyte medium, supplemented with epidermal growth factor (0.2 ng/ml), bovine pituitary extract (30 μg/ml), fetal bovine serum (10%), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). All steps involved in uptake measurements were carried out at room temperature. The medium was aspirated, and the cells were washed once with the uptake buffer. 1 ml of uptake buffer containing radiolabeled substrate (l-carnitine, acetyl-l-carnitine, or propionyl-l-carnitine) was added to the cells and incubated for 30 min. Uptake was terminated by aspirating the buffer and subsequently washing the cells three times with fresh uptake buffer. The cells were lysed with 1 ml of 1% SDS in 0.2 n NaOH, and the lysate was transferred to scintillation vials for quantitation of radioactivity.

Ganapathy V. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 290: 1482-1492PubMed Google Scholar). Uptake measurements were made at room temperature using [3H]carnitine or [14C]TEA. The incubation time was 30 min. The procedure for uptake measurements in cDNA-transfected cells was the same as described for JAR and HPCT cells. However, in some experiments dealing with [14C]TEA uptake, measurements were made in the normal Na+-containing uptake buffer as well as in a Na+-free uptake buffer in which NaCl was replaced iso-osmotically byN-methyl-d-glucamine chloride. HeLa cells cultured in 24-well culture plates were transfected with pSPORT vector alone or with hOCTN2 cDNA. The transfected cDNA was functionally expressed by the vaccinia virus expression technique. Vector-transfected control cells and hOCTN2-expressing cells were than incubated with 1 mm cephaloridine in a NaCl-containing medium or in a Na+-free medium in which NaCl was iso-osmotically replaced by N-methyl-d-glucamine chloride. The incubation was carried out at 37 °C for 1 h. Following the incubation, cells were washed with the uptake medium and then lysed with deionized water (150 μl per well). The lysate was centrifuged to remove cellular membranes, and the supernatant was used to measure the levels of cephaloridine. These measurements were made by HPLC (Beckman System Gold) as described previously by Wold and Turnipseed (16.Wold J.S. Turnipseed S.A. J. Chromatogr. 1977; 136: 170-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Chromatography was carried out on a Kromasil C18 column using the solvent consisting of 85% 1m Tris acetate (pH 3.5) and 15% acetonitrile. The flow rate was 1.3 ml/min. Cephaloridine was detected by ultraviolet absorption at 254 nm. The cephaloridine peak appeared at 7.2 min. Cephaloridine content in samples was determined using a standard curve prepared with known concentrations of cephaloridine. Human PEPT1 cDNA (17.Liang R. Fei Y.J. Prasad P.D. Ramamoorthy S. Han H.

The composition of the uptake buffer was 25 mm Mes/Tris (pH 6.0), 140 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mm MgSO4and 5 mm glucose. The remaining procedure for uptake measurements was the same as described for JAR and HPCT cells. Experiments were repeated 2–4 times, each done in duplicate or triplicate. Results are given as mean ± S.E. of these replicate values. Only the specific, saturable component of uptake was used in data analysis. The non-saturable component in each case was determined by measuring the uptake of radiolabeled substrates in the presence of excess of respective unlabeled substrate. Saturable component was determined by subtracting the non-saturable uptake from total uptake. The kinetic parameters, Michaelis-Menten constant (K t) and the maximal velocity (V max), were calculated by nonlinear regression and confirmed by linear regression. Inhibition constants (K i) were calculated from IC50 values (concentration of the unlabeled β-lactam antibiotic necessary to inhibit 50% of the uptake of radiolabeled substrate) according to the method described previously (20.Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12292) Google Scholar). The β-lactam antibiotics that contain a quaternary nitrogen atom are listed with their structures in Fig. 1. The list includes cephaloridine, cefepime, cefoselis, cefluprenam, and ceftazidime. All of these antibiotics are cephalosporins. These antibiotics were tested along with several other penicillins and cephalosporins for their ability to interact with OCTN2 constitutively expressed in JAR cells. These cells express a Na+-dependent carnitine transporter (21.Prasad P.D. Huang W. Ramamoorthy S. Carter A.L. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1284: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) whose characteristics are similar to those of the cloned human OCTN2 (4.Wu X. Huang W. Prasad P.D. Seth P. Rajan D.P. Leibach F.H. Chen J. Conway S.J. Ganapathy V. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 290: 1482-1492PubMed Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis has shown that JAR cells possess OCTN2 mRNA (2.Wu X. Prasad P.D. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Furthermore, human placenta expresses a Na+-dependent carnitine transporter as do the JAR placental cells (22.Roque A.S. Prasad P.D. Bhatia J.S. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1282: 274-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Therefore, Na+-coupled carnitine transport activity in JAR cells represents the transport function of constitutively expressed OCTN2. The interaction of β-lactam antibiotics with OCTN2 in JAR cells was hence studied by assessing the ability of these compounds (2.5 mm) to compete with carnitine (25 nm) for the transport process (TableI). The most potent inhibitors of carnitine transport were cephaloridine and cefepime, followed by cefluprenam and cefoselis. The inhibition of carnitine transport caused by these antibiotics was in the range of 40–90%. Other antibiotics with a less, but significant, inhibitory potency were cyclacillin, cephradine, and ceftazidime. The inhibition in these cases ranged between 20 and 30%. The remaining antibiotics had negligible ability to interact with OCTN2. The dose-response relationship for the inhibition of carnitine transport by cephaloridine and cefepime is given in Fig. 2. The IC50values (i.e. concentration necessary for 50% inhibition) for cephaloridine and cefepime were 0.18 ± 0.02 and 1.0 ± 0.1 mm, respectively. These IC50 values are very close to inhibition constants (K i) because the concentration of carnitine used in these inhibition experiments was severalfold lower than the Michaelis-Menten constant for carnitine (see below).Table IInhibition of carnitine uptake in JAR cells by β-lactam antibioticsβ-Lactam antibiotic[3H]Carnitine uptakefmol/mg of protein/30 min%Control255 ± 22100Cephalexin223 ± 988Cephradine193 ± 1376Cyclacillin171 ± 467Cefdinir228 ± 1389Cefixime236 ± 1293Cefadroxil236 ± 1093Penicillin227 ± 1689Ampicillin231 ± 1291Cephaloridine25 ± 810Cefepime49 ± 119Cefluprenam147 ± 858Cefoselis154 ± 460Ceftazidime206 ± 1081Uptake of [3H]carnitine (25 nm) in monolayer cultures of JAR cells was measured in the presence of Na+ with an incubation period of 30 min.

Therefore, we tested the ability of cephaloridine to inhibit the transport of acetyl-l-carnitine and propionyl-l-carnitine in JAR cells to provide additional evidence for the interaction of this cephalosporin with OCTN2 (Fig.3). The transport of these acyl esters of carnitine was found to be inhibited about 70% by 1 mmcephaloridine. Cefadroxil was one of the cephalosporins that did not have any significant inhibitory effect on carnitine transport. This cephalosporin was found to have no effect on the transport of acetyl-l-carnitine and propionyl-l-carnitine. The kinetic nature of the inhibition was analyzed with cephaloridine (Fig. 4). Carnitine transport in JAR cells was saturable with a Michaelis-Menten constant (K t) of 12.6 ± 1.4 μm and a maximal velocity (V max) of 133 ± 8 pmol/mg protein/30 min. The presence of 0.3 mm cephaloridine caused a 2-fold increase in the K t value (23.1 ± 1.1 μm) without affecting the V max(139 ± 3) pmol/mg protein/30 min). These results show that cephaloridine competes with carnitine for the same binding site on the transporter. OCTN2 in the kidney participates in the reabsorption of filtered carnitine. Brush border membrane vesicles isolated from renal cortex have been shown to possess Na+-dependent high affinity carnitine transport activity (22.Roque A.S. Prasad P.D. Bhatia J.S. Leibach F.H.

We investigated the interaction of cephaloridine and other β-lactam antibiotics containing a quaternary nitrogen with the carnitine transporter expressed constitutively in these renal epithelial cells. The results were very similar to those obtained with JAR cells (data not shown). Cephaloridine, cefepime, cefoselis, and cefluprenam were found to inhibit carnitine transport in these cells with the same potency as found in JAR cells. In addition, the inhibition by cephaloridine was competitive. The cloned human OCTN2 was expressed in HeLa cells heterologously, and its interaction with β-lactam antibiotics was studied (Table II). Among several β-lactam antibiotics tested, only those that contain a quaternary nitrogen atom inhibited human OCTN2-mediated carnitine transport. These antibiotics were cephaloridine, cefepime, cefluprenam, and cefoselis. The only exception was ceftazidime that did not inhibit carnitine transport. All other β-lactam antibiotics tested did not have any significant effect on carnitine transport mediated by human OCTN2. Among the four inhibitors, cephaloridine and cefepime were more potent than cefluprenam and cefoselis. These results with cloned human OCTN2 are similar to those obtained with constitutively expressed OCTN2 in JAR cells and HPCT cells.Table IIInhibition of hOCTN2-mediated carnitine uptake by β-lactam antibioticsβ-Lactam antibiotic[3H]Carnitine uptakepmol/10 6 cells/30 min%Control2.82 ± 0.27100Cephalexin2.73 ± 0.2897Cephradine3.01 ± 0.22107Cyclacillin2.64 ± 0.2494Cefdinir2.89 ± 0.14103Cefixime2.72 ± 0.1797Cefadroxil2.76 ± 0.2198Penicillin2.90 ± 0.29103Ampicillin2.78 ± 0.3299Cephaloridine0.37 ± 0.0613Cefepime0.76 ± 0.0827Cefluprenam2.09 ± 0.0274Cefoselis2.25 ± 0.0480Ceftazidime3.01 ± 0.33107Human OCTN2 was expressed heterologously in HeLa cells, and its transport function was monitored by measuring the uptake of [3H]carnitine (20 nm) in the presence of Na+ with an incubation period of 30 min.

Therefore, it was of interest to evaluate the Na+dependence of the interaction of the inhibitory β-lactam antibiotics with OCTN2. For these experiments, the organic cation TEA was used as the substrate of OCTN2 for transport measurements. The transport of TEA via OCTN2 is Na+-independent and therefore its transport can be studied in the presence or absence of Na+. The Na+ dependence of the interaction of β-lactam antibiotics was investigated by assessing the relative ability of these compounds to inhibit OCTN2-mediated TEA transport in the presence and absence of Na+. Rat OCTN2 was chosen for these studies rather than human OCTN2 because the former transports TEA and carnitine equally well, whereas the latter transports TEA at a much lower rate (4.Wu X. Huang W.

Molecules up to about 600 Da in size are taken up by a set of more or less substrate-specific porins and transporters. Outer membrane proteins were among the first integral membrane proteins for which crystal structures have been solved by x-ray diffraction. In contrast to most proteins of the inner membrane, which are of the helical bundle type, the common structural motif of the outer membrane proteins is the β-barrel, i.e.an antiparallel β-sheet that closes on itself. Porins with 16 (OmpF, OmpC, PhoE (phosphophorin)),118 (LamB), or 22 (FhuA, FepA) antiparallel β-strands have been described (1.Cowan S.W. Schirmer T. Rummel G. Steiert M. Gosh R. Pauptit R.A.

The outer walls of their structures are generally hydrophobic (to match the lipid bilayer), and they have water-filled central pores of variable sizes through which substrates are taken up. Whereas the porins are usually trimeric, the iron-siderophore transporters, FhuA and FepA, are monomeric. The substrate specificity of these proteins arises from specific residues in the pore, special peptide segments (aromatic “greasy slide” in LamB), or entire protein domains (periplasmic “cork” in FhuA). When incorporated into black lipid membranes, porins exhibit single channel activities that strongly depend on the particular porin, the applied transmembrane potential, and the type and concentration of the electrolyte in the environment. For example, OmpF of Escherichia coli has a conductance of 0.8 nanosiemens in 1 m NaCl, whereas the major porin from Rhodopseudomonas blastica, which is of similar size, exhibits a conductance of 3.9 nanosiemens in 1m KCl (5.Phale P.S.

Although the mass of OmpA is similar to that of many other porins, OmpA consists of two separate domains. The N-terminal domain is integrated into the membrane in the form of a small β-barrel of only eight antiparallel β-strands. In addition, a C-terminal globular domain of approximately 150 residues extends into the periplasm. Unlike the porins, OmpA most likely exists as a monomer in the outer membrane. The crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of OmpA has recently been solved by x-ray diffraction (7.Pautsch A. Schulz G.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 1013-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Compared with the larger porins, the barrel of this “miniporin” is very tight, with mostly hydrophilic residues and a few aqueous cavities closely packed in the lumen of the barrel. Providing structural stability to the cell appears to be one of the main functions of OmpA. This is probably accomplished by linking through the C-terminal domain the outer membrane to the periplasmic peptidoglycan. Additionally, OmpA mediates bacterial conjugation and functions as a receptor for various bacteriophages. OmpA has also been reported to form channels or pores in lipid bilayers, although this aspect of the protein is somewhat controversial. Saint et al. (8.Saint N. De E. Julien S. Orange N. Molle G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1145: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) measured single channel conductance events in “solvent-free” planar bilayers on the order of 180 pS at 100 mV and in 0.25 m KCl. Based on osmotic swelling experiments with reconstituted OmpA proteoliposomes, Sugawara and Nikaido (9.Sugawara E. Nikaido H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 17981-17987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) concluded that OmpA forms a diffusion channel of about 10 Å in diameter. However, only 2–3% of all OmpA molecules were in the open conformation in their preparation, and vesicles containing open channels could be separated from closed channel vesicles by density gradient centrifugation. These experiments indicated that the open and closed forms represent two different, relatively stable conformations of OmpA. The crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of OmpA, which was obtained from crystals formed from an OmpA fragment that was solubilized in the detergent C8E4, indicated no obvious aqueous pore, as the water-filled cavities were not connected in that structure (7.Pautsch A. Schulz G.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 1013-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Based on their structure, these authors therefore questioned the ability of OmpA to form ion- or solute-conducting pores. OmpA has also served as an excellent model to study the folding and membrane insertion of a constitutive integral membrane protein (11.Kleinschmidt J.H. Tamm L.K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12993-13000Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 12.Kleinschmidt J.H. Tamm L.K.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5006-5016Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In these studies, OmpA was refolded from 8 m urea by rapid dilution into a solution containing preformed lipid vesicles (or detergent micelles). OmpA seems to be ideally suited for these studies partly because it is a relatively small, yet polytopic integral membrane protein and also because as a β-barrel membrane protein it has a sequence of alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues. This property makes the membrane-spanning sequences on average less hydrophobic than those of helical bundle membrane proteins, which therefore cannot be completely solubilized and unfolded in urea. However, a good functional assay to monitor the refolding of OmpA has been lacking up until now. Because the formation of ion channels by OmpA has not been universally accepted and to develop a practical assay for the refolding of OmpA, we re-investigated the channel activity of OmpA in a well defined reconstituted lipid bilayer system. We found that both native OmpA and OmpA that was refolded in the detergent C8E4forms two types of ion-conducting channels in planar bilayer membranes. The more frequent smaller channels exhibited a conductance of 50–80 pS and the less frequent larger channels a conductance of 260–320 pS in 1m KCl at a 100 mV membrane potential. The smaller but not the larger conductance state was also observed when the N-terminal transmembrane domain, i.e. a fragment comprising residues 1–176, was refolded and incorporated into planar lipid bilayers. Five single tryptophan mutants of OmpA exhibited small and large channel conductances similar to those of wild-type OmpA. OmpA and single tryptophan mutants of OmpA were expressed in the OmpA-deficient E. coli strain MC4100rh− as described previously (13.Kleinschmidt J.H. den Blaauwen T. Driessen A.J.M. Tamm L.K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5006-5016Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). These proteins were purified from the outer membranes by urea extraction and ion-exchange chromatography of the unfolded proteins in 8 m urea using a Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column (11.Kleinschmidt J.H. Tamm L.K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12993-13000Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The transmembrane domain of OmpA Trp-7, Trp-7-(1–176), was generated from the single tryptophan mutant Trp-7 by utilizing site-directed mutagenesis to convert the codon for proline 177 to a stop codon. Briefly, the OmpA gene was transferred from pET1102 (13.Kleinschmidt J.H. den Blaauwen T. Driessen A.J.M. Tamm L.K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5006-5016Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) into pAlter-1 (Promega, Madison, WI). The mutagenic primer 5′-CAGGGCGAAGCAGCTTAAGTAGTTGCTCCGGC-3′, which also contained a unique site for AflII and the commercial Amp selection primer (Promega), were used to introduce a stop codon at position 177. The mutagenized gene was reintroduced into pET1102 for expression in MC4100rh−. The correct sequence was verified by sequencing. Trp-7-(1–176) was purified using essentially the same protocol as for OmpA, except that a final gel filtration step on a Superdex-75 HR column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 20 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.3, 50 mm NaCl, containing 8m urea, was added to separate the transmembrane domain from residual impurities. A sample of wild-type OmpA that was purified in its native form was a kind gift of Dr. Hiroshi Nikaido (University of California, Berkeley). This protein was derived from an OmpF- and OmpC-deficient K12-derivative E. coli strain (HN705) and was purified from the outer membrane by detergent extraction and repeated gel filtration over a Sephacryl S-300 column in dodecylmaltoside (14.Sugawara E. Steiert M. Rouhani S. Nikaido H. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6067-6069Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,15.Sugawara E. Nikaido H. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: A138Google Scholar). Native OmpA was suspended in 10 mm Tris-Cl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% dodecylmaltoside. For single channel measurements, these samples were diluted into a 20 mm micellar solution of tetraoxyethylene mono-n-octylether (C8E4, Bachem, Philadelphia, PA) to a concentration of 80 μg/ml, i.e. the same as that used for the refolded proteins that were obtained by the urea purification method. Refolding of OmpA and its derivatives was carried out as described in more detail by Kleinschmidt et al. (16.Kleinschmidt J.H. Wiener M.C. Tamm L.K. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2065-2071Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μl of a 4 mg/ml solution of unfolded OmpA in 15 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.5, containing 8 m urea was diluted 50-fold into a 20 mm solution of C8E4 in 2 mm sodium borate, pH 10.0, containing 0.4 mmEDTA. The mixture was incubated overnight at 40 °C to ensure complete refolding of the protein. To remove misfolded protein aggregates the samples were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm in a table-top centrifuge (Eppendorff, Rexdale, Ontario) for 15 min prior to the addition to the planar membranes. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed according to the method of Laemmli (17.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207516) Google Scholar). For checking the purity of the proteins, samples were diluted (1:1, v/v) with treatment buffer (0.125m Tris-Cl, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.2% bromphenol blue), boiled at 100 °C for 5 min, and run on 12% polyacrylamide gels for the full-length OmpA proteins or 14% polyacrylamide gels for the transmembrane fragment. For measuring protein refolding by the gel-shift assay, the refolded samples were either boiled or incubated at 40 °C for 5 min and run on a 10–15% gradient polyacrylamide gel. Protein bands were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Planar lipid bilayers were formed from a solution of 17 mg/ml diphytanoylphosphatidylcholine (DPhPC, Avanti Polar Lipids, Birmingham, AL) in n-decane (Aldrich) using the method of Mueller et al. (18.Mueller P. Rudin D.O. Tien H.T. Wescott W.C. Circulation. 1962; 26: 1167-1171Crossref Google Scholar) with some modifications (19.Busath D. Szabo G. Nature. 1981; 294: 371-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The lipid solution was painted on a 500-μm hole in a Teflon partition separating two 1.5-ml compartments, which were filled with KCl buffer (1 m KCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.1). The compartments were connected to the recording system through two chlorided silver electrodes, one of which (the front,cis side) was grounded, whereas the other (the rear,trans side) was connected to a custom designed trans-impedance amplifier. The painted DPhPC/n-decane bilayer membranes were tested for integrity by checking the reflectance optically and also by their resistance and capacitance. After the bilayers were formed, 5 μl of 80 μg/ml of OmpA in C8E4 micelles were added to the ciscompartment and stirred. Conductance measurements were made after about 10 min of equilibration with a 100-mV potential applied to thetrans compartment. The current across the bilayer was recorded on magnetic medium. For analysis, the signal was filtered at 100 Hz with an 8 pole low-pass filter and digitized at 1 KHz (LABMAN, G. Szabo and C. Q. Ye, University of Virginia). Single channel conductance events were analyzed using TRANSIT (Baylor School of Medicine, Houston, TX), and IGOR (Wavemetrics, Portland, OR) software packages. Single channel conductance events were identified automatically in most traces. In a few traces where baseline noise was unusually large, it was difficult to identify transitions reliably by automated analysis. In such cases conductance steps were analyzed interactively using IGOR. The interactive and automated procedures yielded the same results, in terms of conductance levels and single channel histograms in all traces that were analyzed by both methods. The data were averaged from three to seven independent recordings, which all lasted for several minutes for each protein and condition. A typical trace of a single channel recording of OmpA that was purified in its native form from the outer membranes of anE. coli K12-derivative strain by detergent extraction is shown in Fig. 1. In this (and all subsequent) experiment(s) OmpA in C8E4 micelles was added to the cis compartment next to DPhPC/n-decane bilayers and equilibrated, and a 100-mV potential was applied to the trans compartment. Two types of unitary conductance increases, indicated by downward deflections, were immediately induced. When in control experiments the detergent C8E4 alone was added in an amount equivalent to four times of that used in the mixed detergent/OmpA micelles, no channel activity was observed for several minutes (trace labeled C8E4 in Fig. 1). Three different conductance states are evident in the recording of native OmpA. In state I, all channels are closed, exhibiting a baseline conductance. In state II, a single small channel is open, exhibiting a conductance of the order of 50 pS, and in state III, a large channel with a conductance of the order of 320 pS is open. The trace begins at time A in state II with a single small channel open. At B, a large channel opens (state III) and closes again at C (state II). At D, the small channel closes to the baseline conductance state I. Between D and E, a small channel opens and closes. At E, a large channel opens directly from the baseline conductance state (state I → state III) but closes only to the open state of small channel at F (state III → state II), which closes at G to the baseline (state II → state I). A small channel opens again at H (state I → state II) and converts into a large channel at I (state II → state III), which closes directly to the baseline at J (state III → state I). A histogram of the single channel conductance levels of native OmpA is shown in the lower part of Fig. 1. The distribution of 413 total observed events shows three well separated peaks. Small channels of 40–60 pS conductance (mean 52 pS) accounted for 55% of all events. Two additional peaks corresponding to the state II ↔ state III (mean 268 pS) and state I ↔ state III (mean 317 pS) transitions are also evident. One might ask whether the coexistence of small and large channels of OmpA reflects two separate populations of molecules that co-exist in planar bilayers or whether the observed channels originate from a single population with interchanging conformations. The following observations support the latter possibility: first, we never observed the simultaneous opening of two large channels or two small channels; and second, the large channels open and close either from/to the baseline or from/to the open state of a small channel, but small channels only open and close from/to the baseline and never from the open state of a large channel. Therefore, it appears that the small channels are kinetic precursors of the larger channels. OmpA is one of only a few proteins that can be refolded into preformed lipid bilayers. One goal of this study was to determine whether refolded OmpA exhibits the same single channel activity as native OmpA. A convenient assay to follow the refolding of OmpA is to monitor an increase in the mobility on polyacrylamide gels of the refolded relative to the unfolded proteins (20.Schweizer M. Hindennach I. Garten W. Henning U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 82: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). This shift in mobility is only expressed in samples that are not boiled prior to electrophoresis. Upon denaturation by heat (or urea), OmpA runs on SDS gels as a single band that corresponds to an apparent molecular weight of 35 kDa, whereas native or refolded OmpA runs as a single band with an apparent molecular weight of 30 kDa (Fig.2). Refolding of OmpA into lipid bilayers or detergent micelles can also be demonstrated by monitoring a change of the intrinsic Trp fluorescence (11.Kleinschmidt J.H. Tamm L.K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12993-13000Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 16.Kleinschmidt J.H. Wiener M.C. Tamm L.K. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2065-2071Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). When we incorporated refolded OmpA in C8E4 into planar lipid bilayers at the same concentrations as native OmpA, we again found unitary conductance values of similar magnitude as for the small and large channels of native OmpA. However, in contrast to the native protein, interconversions between the two conductance states were much rarer. In most cases, a single bilayer recording contained either small or large channels. About 80–85% of all recordings displayed predominantly small channels and about 15–20% predominantly large channels. Small and large channel recordings are displayed in Figs.3 and 5, respectively. Because the data of the two types of channels are from different recordings (but still from the same refolded OmpA stocks), separate histograms are shown for the small and large channels in Figs. 4and 5, respectively. There are precedents for the observation that single channels occur in two different but well defined conformations with relatively rare interconversions. For example, gramicidin A is known to form “mini-channels” and the interconversion frequency between the main and mini-channels is rather low (19.Busath D. Szabo G. Nature. 1981; 294: 371-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Analyzing 1173 small OmpA channel events from seven independent experiments, we found that their single channel conductance values ranged from 40 to 95 pS and followed an approximately Gaussian distribution with a mean value of 66 pS and a standard error of 15 pS. In all experiments, the membranes were stable, and the channel activity lasted for the duration of 15–30-min experiments. The large channels of refolded OmpA were relatively noisy in the open state (Fig. 5,top trace). Despite this noise, we were able to measure the distribution of the large channel events of the refolded OmpA as shown in the lower left panel of Fig. 5. The mean large channel conductance of refolded OmpA was 261 pS (212 events), i.e.similar to the conductance change associated with the small-to-large channel conversion of native OmpA (see Fig. 1).Figure 3Single channel recordings of small channels of refolded OmpA, its single Trp mutants, and the N-terminal transmembrane domain (residues 1–176) of the Trp-7 mutant in planar bilayers.

The number of evaluated events and mean channel conductances for each protein are described under “Results.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) OmpA contains five tryptophans that are each located on a different transmembrane strand of the N-terminal β-barrel. In previous work we have used single Trp mutants of OmpA to monitor the site-specific rates of polypetide translocation and thus were able to dissect the folding pathway of this protein in lipid bilayers at unprecedent resolution (13.Kleinschmidt J.H. den Blaauwen T. Driessen A.J.M. Tamm L.K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5006-5016Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). These mutants each had four of the five native tryptophans replaced by phenylalanines. To support our earlier conclusion, which was based on the absence of a perturbation of a phage-binding epitope, that these mutations did not significantly perturb the overall structure and function of OmpA, we wanted to know whether these changes had an effect on the single channel conductance of refolded OmpA. Fig.2 shows that all five single Trp mutants that were used in our previous study (13.Kleinschmidt J.H. den Blaauwen T. Driessen A.J.M. Tamm L.K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5006-5016Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) refolded into C8E4 micelles as determined by the gel shift assay. Representative recordings of small channels of each of these refolded mutant proteins are shown intraces 2–6 of Fig. 3. Although there are clear differences in open channel noise levels and average open times, similar single channel conductance levels were observed for all mutants and these were not much different from those of the wild-type protein. The Trp-7 mutant exhibited well defined channels, which, however, were slightly smaller in conductance than the wild-type channels. Analyzing 217 events yielded a mean channel conductance of 51 pS (Fig. 4). The channels of the Trp-15 mutant were typically open for several seconds and closed only for very short durations. The 136 counted events exhibited a mean channel conductance of 54 pS (Fig. 4). A different pattern was observed with the Trp-57 mutant. The channels were either closed or open for several seconds, but while in their open state, they showed fast fluctuations which may correspond to rapid opening and closing events. For 647 events counted, the mean channel conductance was 67 pS. The channels formed by the Trp-102 and Trp-143 mutants displayed a similar behavior, but were open most of the time (Fig. 3). The 624 events counted for Trp-102 had a conductance of 59 pS, whereas the mean channel conductance of Trp-143 was 65 pS, counted for 114 events (Fig. 4). Thus, the mean channel conductance levels were about 60–70 pS for the refolded wild-type, Trp-57, Trp-102, and Trp-143 proteins and about 50–60 pS for native OmpA and the refolded Trp-7 and Trp-15 proteins. Large channels were also observed for all refolded single Trp mutants. For example, Trp-15 exhibited a mean conductance of 246 pS (1040 events) and Trp-143 a mean conductance of 270 pS (365 total >150 pS events; Fig. 5). In addition, relatively rare conductance steps of intermediate size (mean 191 pS) were observed with this mutant. Trp-7, Trp-57, and Trp-102 also showed intermediate size single channel conductance levels (only Trp-7 is shown as an example in Fig. 5). Channels of the order of 198 pS conductance (98 events), 155 pS (42 events), and 161 pS (70 events) were observed for the Trp-7, Trp-57, and Trp-102 mutants, respectively. Fig. 3 (bottom trace) shows the recording of a further control that was carried out with the Trp-57 mutant protein. In this case, the protein was deliberately misfolded. It is well known that OmpA hydrophobically collapses, exhibits a very different CD spectrum, and eventually aggregates when diluted from an 8 m urea solution into an aqueous buffer lacking detergent micelles or lipid bilayers (16.Kleinschmidt J.H. Wiener M.C. Tamm L.K. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2065-2071Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 23.Surrey T. Jähnig F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7457-7461Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). When an equivalent amount of water-collapsed OmpA was added to the planar bilayers, neither small nor large single channel events could be observed. This experiment demonstrates that the channels observed in the upper traces of Figs. 3 and 5 are because of functionally refolded OmpA. Because OmpA is a two domain protein consisting of an N-terminal transmembrane β-barrel domain and a periplasmic C-terminal domain, it is interesting to ask whether the transmembrane domain alone exhibits a similar channel activity as the full-length protein. To address this question we expressed the N-terminal domain (residues 1–176) of the Trp-7 mutant protein, designated Trp-7-(1–176). Trp-7-(1–176) was correctly targeted to the outer membrane of E. coli, which gives a first indication that this domain may fold and assemble normally in the outer membrane. The purified fragment was then refolded in C8E4 and analyzed by its migration on SDS"
https://openalex.org/W2078721711,"Abstract Reactive oxygen species and growth factors stimulate similar intracellular signal transduction events including activation of Src kinase family members and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2). A potentially important downstream effector of Src and ERK1/2 is p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (p90RSK), which plays an important role in cell growth by activating several transcription factors as well as the Na+/H+ exchanger. In the present study, we determined whether H2O2 activates p90RSK to gain insight into signal transduction mechanisms activated by reactive oxygen species. H2O2 (200 μm) stimulated ERK1/2 and p90RSK activity in lymphocytes, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts. The MEK-1 inhibitor, PD98059 (30 μm), inhibited H2O2-mediated activation of ERK1/2 but not of p90RSK. An essential role for Fyn and Ras in p90RSK activation was suggested by five findings. 1) The tyrosine kinase inhibitor, herbimycin A, and the specific Src kinase family inhibitor, PP1, blocked p90RSK activation by H2O2 in a concentration-dependent manner. 2) p90RSK activation by H2O2 was significantly reduced in fibroblasts derived from transgenic mice deficient in Fyn, but not c-Src. 3) H2O2rapidly activated Ras (peak at 2–5 min), which preceded p90RSK activation (peak at 20 min). 4) Dominant negative Ras completely blocked H2O2-induced activation of p90RSK. 5) In Fyn−/− fibroblasts, activation of Ras by H2O2 was significantly attenuated. These results show essential roles for Fyn and Ras in H2O2-mediated activation of p90RSK and establish redox-sensitive regulation of Ras and p90RSK as a new function for Fyn."

We have demonstrated that the amyloidogenic light chain was inherently less thermodynamically stable than its nonpathological counterpart and that the protein hydrogen-deuterium (H-D) exchange rates, which reflect relative levels of partially folded protein molecules, correlated directly with the propensity of these molecules to form fibrils.

In contrast, patient GAL, despite the excretion of up to 100 g of Bence Jones protein daily, did not have any detectable pathologic protein deposits. The lyophilized proteins were reconstituted into 10 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.4 at 37 °C, with 100 mm NaCl (PBS) to a protein concentration of 1 mg/ml (unless otherwise indicated), filtered through a 0.2-μm syringe filter, and incubated at 37 °C. Samples were prepared in PBS alone, PBS plus 1.0m sucrose and PBS plus 1.0 m urea. Fibrils were generated in vitro as described by Solomon et al.(18.Solomon A. Weiss D.T. Murphy C.L. Hrncic R. Wall J.S. Schell M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9547-9551Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), except the sample volume was 0.15 ml. Samples were assayed immediately after preparation and daily thereafter for fibrils (19.Naiki H. Higuchi K. Hosokawa M. Sugita T. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 244-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar) and for soluble protein (20.Kendrick B.S. Randolph T.W. Cleland J.L. Lam X. Nguyen T. Manning M.C. Carpenter J.F. J. Pharm.

For detection of fibrils, 20 μl of 1 mg/ml protein solution were added to 1.98 ml of a 10 μmsolution of thioflavin T prepared in 50 mm glycine buffer (pH 9.0). Fluorescence was measured with an Aviv model ATF105 spectrofluorometer, with excitation at 450 nm and emission at 482 nm. Corrections were made for the fluorescence of 20 μl of solutions prepared without protein. Soluble protein analysis was performed on a Hewlett Packard HP1090 high performance liquid chromatography system using a TOSOHAAS G2000SWXL size exclusion column, with a mobile phase containing 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.9, and a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min. Chromatograms were obtained by monitoring absorbance at 215 nm. The injection amount was 25 μg of protein. Prior to chromatography, samples were centrifuged at 4 °C in a microfuge for 5 min. In addition, a 0.2-μm filter was in place between the injection loop and the column. Far UV circular dichroism spectra were collected and processed as described previously (16.Kendrick B.S.

Infrared spectra of the soluble proteins and fibrils in H2O-PBS buffer were acquired and analyzed as described previously (16.Kendrick B.S. Chang B.S. Arakawa T. Peterson B. Randolph T.W. Manning M.C. Carpenter J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11917-11922Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) using a Bomem Prota infrared spectrometer. Samples (40 mg/ml protein in PBS) were placed in a BioTools liquid sampling cell, equipped with CaF2 windows that provided a 6-μm pathlength. H-D exchange was monitored with infrared spectroscopy, and deuterated sucrose and urea were prepared as described previously (16.Kendrick B.S. Chang B.S. Arakawa T. Peterson B. Randolph T.W. Manning M.C. Carpenter J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11917-11922Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Protein samples in H2O-PBS at 40 mg/ml concentration were diluted into D2O-PBS (alone, or with deuterated sucrose or urea) to give a final protein concentration of 10 mg/ml and a final D2O content of 75%. Samples were immediately placed in the sample cell, and spectra were acquired as a function of time at 23 °C. Spectra were processed and analyzed as described previously (16.Kendrick B.S. Chang B.S.

H-D exchange was monitored by plotting the frequency of the second derivative amide I band, which was at 1692 cm−1 in spectra for the proteins in H2O, as a function time of exposure to 75% D2O. Unfolding curves were constructed by measuring intrinsic protein fluorescence as a function of guanidine HCl concentration or temperature (10.Raffen R. Dieckman L.J. Szpunar M. Wunschl C. Phani R.P. Poras D. Wilkens Stevens P. Cai X. Schiffer M. Stevens F.J. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 509-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 12.McCutchen S.L. Lai Z. Miroy G.J. Kelly J.W. Colon W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13527-13535Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), with an Aviv ATF 105 spectrofluorometer. The fluorescence values of protein solutions were corrected for PBS, 1.0 m sucrose or urea, as appropriate. For chemical denaturation studies, 10 μg/ml protein samples in PBS (alone, or with 1.0 m sucrose or urea) were incubated overnight at 4 °C with a range of guanidine HCl concentrations. For each solution condition, three separate sets of protein/guanidine HCl solutions were prepared and analyzed at 25 °C, and the mean ± S.D. for these triplicate samples were determined. The fraction protein unfolded and the free energy of unfolding of a reference state (BIF protein in PBS) were calculated using the method described by Pace (22.Pace C.N. Trends Biotechnol. 1990; 8: 93-98Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). The free energies of unfolding of BIF in 1.0 m sucrose and 1.0 m urea as well as GAL protein under each solution condition were calculated, employing BIF in PBS as a reference condition and the C m for a given solution (10.Raffen R. Dieckman L.J. Szpunar M. Wunschl C. Phani R.P. Poras D. Wilkens Stevens P. Cai X. Schiffer M. Stevens F.J. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 509-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), using the following relationship: ΔG unf = ΔG unfBIF in PBS + (m BIF in PBS × (C m − C mBIF in PBS)), where m is the slope of the linear transition region and Cm is the midpoint of the transition. This approach was taken because of the differences in slopes of the unfolding curves for the different solution conditions (cf.Ref. 10.Raffen R. Dieckman L.J. Szpunar M. Wunschl C. Phani R.P. Poras D. Wilkens Stevens P. Cai X. Schiffer M. Stevens F.J. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 509-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Thermal unfolding was determined by heating samples (10 μg/ml protein in PBS alone or with 1.0 m sucrose or urea) at 1 °C/min. Determinations were made for triplicate samples of each solution condition. The results were reported as the mean ± S.D. of the apparent midpoints of the thermal unfolding transition (T m), because the thermal unfolding was only ∼80% reversible. The protein GAL was sequenced as described previously (18.Solomon A. Weiss D.T. Murphy C.L. Hrncic R. Wall J.S. Schell M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9547-9551Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Congo red staining and transmission electron microscopic examination of fibrils were performed as described previously (18.Solomon A. Weiss D.T. Murphy C.L. Hrncic R. Wall J.S. Schell M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9547-9551Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). As evidenced from amino acid sequence data (Fig.1), the V gene-encoded proteins of light chains BIF and GAL were products of the Vκ1 germline gene 018-08. The J gene-encoded portions of proteins BIF and GAL were derived from the Jκ2 and Jκ5 germline genes, respectively (23.Heiter P.A. Maizel Jr., J.V. Leder P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1516-1522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, the VL region of the two light chains consisted of 108 amino acid residues that differed from each other at 15 positions (sequence identity, 86%). The constant regions of each protein contained 107 residues that were identical in sequence except for the substitution in BIF of Asn for Ser at position 177. When tested in an in vitro fibrillogenic assay (18.Solomon A. Weiss D.T. Murphy C.L. Hrncic R. Wall J.S. Schell M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9547-9551Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), the amount of native soluble BIF decreased within 1 day, and by day 5, 80% was insoluble (Figs. 2 A and3 A). There was a concomitant increase in thioflavin T fluorescence because of formation of fibrils (Fig.3 B). Incubation of the nonpathological protein GAL under identical conditions for 5 days led to <3% loss of soluble protein and no detectable fibrils (Fig.3).Figure 3Effect of duration of incubation at 37 °C on soluble protein levels and thioflavin T fluorescence. A, relative height of main protein peak on size exclusion chromatogram. Results for samples incubated for ≥1 day in 1.0m urea are based on the actual absorbance of the shoulder occurring at the retention time of the original main peak. This analysis was necessitated because the formation of soluble aggregates shifted the retention time of the largest peak. The shoulder area for which a value is given most likely represents both native and aggregated protein, but the actual levels of each cannot be determined. Thus, the value given represents an overestimate of the actual level of native protein. B, thioflavin T fluorescence of 10 μg/ml protein samples (see “Experimental Procedures”). Results are shown for samples incubated at 1 mg/ml: BIF in PBS alone (●); BIF in PBS with 1.0 m sucrose (▪); BIF in PBS with 1.0 murea (▴); GAL in PBS alone (○); GAL in PBS with 1.0 msucrose (■); GAL in PBS with 1.0 m urea (▵).

After Congo red staining, the fibrils exhibited green birefringence when viewed under cross-polarizers (data not shown). The fibrils had a characteristic intermolecular β-sheet structure as documented by a strong band at 1625 cm−1 (24.Dong A. Prestrelski S.J. Allison S.D. Carpenter J.F. J. Pharm. Sci. 1995; 84: 415-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar) in their second derivative infrared spectrum (Fig.4). There was also a partial loss of native intramolecular β-sheet structure, as indicated by the decrease in absorbance at 1638 cm−1. Quantitative analysis of the spectra (16.Kendrick B.S. Chang B.S. Arakawa T. Peterson B. Randolph T.W. Manning M.C. Carpenter J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11917-11922Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) showed that the fibrils contained 38% intermolecular β-sheet, 27% intramolecular β-sheet, 32% turns, and 3% random elements. The native BIF protein contained 62% intramolecular β-sheet, 5% α-helix, and 33% turn structures (Fig. 4). Native GAL had 61% intramolecular β-sheet, 13% α-helix, and 26% turn structures (Fig. 4). The two proteins also had similar secondary structural contents based on far UV circular dichroism spectroscopy (data not shown). Comparison of Physical Properties of BIF and GAL—In PBS, BIF unfolded at lower guanidine concentrations and had a lower free energy of unfolding compared with GAL (Fig.5; TableI). Also, the apparent midpoint and onset temperatures for thermal unfolding were about 5 °C lower for BIF than for GAL (Fig. 5; Table I).Table IThermodynamic parameters of BIF and GAL determined from unfolding curvesProteinBuffer−mC maCm was calculated by complex sigmoid, nonlinear regression analysis.[GdnHCl]ΔG unfbΔG unf was calculated using BIF in PBS buffer as reference state with: ΔG unf = ΔG unfBIF in PBS + (m BIF in PBS × (C m −C mBIF in PBS)).T mcThe midpoint of the thermal transition is referred to as the apparent midpoint, because thermally induced unfolding was only ∼80% reversible.Kcal/mol/mKcal/mol°CBIFBuffer2.51 ± 0.041.05 ± 0.062.63 ± 0.1845.1 ± 0.351.0 m sucrose1.70 ± 0.081.70 ± 0.024.25 ± 0.0851.0 ± 0.061.0m urea3.33 ± 0.180.72 ± 0.011.80 ± 0.0540.8 ± 0.10GALBuffer1.85 ± 0.041.48 ± 0.013.71 ± 0.0850.2 ± 0.251.0 m sucrose1.47 ± 0.132.13 ± 0.025.35 ± 0.0754.6 ± 0.231.0m urea2.01 ± 0.081.09 ± 0.022.72 ± 0.0845.8 ± 0.17a Cm was calculated by complex sigmoid, nonlinear regression analysis.b ΔG unf was calculated using BIF in PBS buffer as reference state with: ΔG unf = ΔG unfBIF in PBS + (m BIF in PBS × (C m −C mBIF in PBS)).c The midpoint of the thermal transition is referred to as the apparent midpoint, because thermally induced unfolding was only ∼80% reversible. Open table in a new tab The H-D exchange rates of the two proteins also differed. Immediately upon placing the proteins into 75% D2O PBS, there were shifts in the amide I bands because of the exchange of hydrogen for deuterium in residues at the protein surface (Figs. 4, 6). Over the time course of 24 h, there was continued exchange, which can be ascribed to residues that are near the surface of individual molecules (16.Kendrick B.S. Chang B.S. Arakawa T. Peterson B.

The exchange rate was much more rapid for BIF than GAL (Fig. 6), indicating that BIF had a higher level of partially folded species in its molecular population (13.Booth D.R. Sunde M. Bellotti V. Robinson C.V. Hutchinson W.L. Fraser P.E. Hawkins P.N. Dobson C.M. Radford S.E. Blake C.C.F. Pepys M.B. Nature. 1997; 385: 787-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar, 16.Kendrick B.S.

Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 3399-3406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). With 1.0 m sucrose, the thermodynamic stability of BIF was increased to that measured for GAL in PBS alone (Fig. 5 and Table I). As a result, there was complete inhibition of loss of native BIF protein during the same experiment in which 80% of the native protein was lost in PBS alone (Fig. 3 A). Furthermore, no fibrils were detected (Fig. 3 B). Sucrose (1.0 m) also increased the thermodynamic stability of GAL (Fig. 5 and Table I), and loss of neither native protein nor fibrils was detected (Fig. 3). In addition to increasing the free energy barrier between native and unfolded states (14.Lee J.C. Timasheff S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7193-7201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Timasheff S.N. Adv. Protein Chem. 1998; 51: 356-432Google Scholar), sucrose also shifts the equilibrium between protein states toward the most compact native conformation and away from expanded species and, hence, reduces the H-D exchange rate (16.Kendrick B.S. Chang B.S. Arakawa T. Peterson B. Randolph T.W. Manning M.C. Carpenter J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11917-11922Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar,27.Chang B.S.

Cleland J.L. Randolph T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14142-14146Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). With BIF, 1.0 m sucrose reduced the rate of exchange to approximately that noted with nonpathological GAL in PBS alone (Fig. 6). Sucrose also reduced the exchange rate for GAL (Fig.6). To test whether reducing thermodynamic stability would foster protein aggregation and fibril formation, we investigated the effects of 1.0 m urea on BIF and GAL. Size exclusion chromatography of BIF and GAL immediately after exposure to 1.0m urea resulted in elution profiles identical to those determined for respective protein samples in PBS alone, documenting the fact that urea did not cause any immediate formation of soluble or insoluble aggregates (Fig. 2 and data not shown). With BIF, after 1–4 days of incubation at 37 °C, there were greater losses of native, soluble protein than noted in samples prepared in PBS alone (Figs. 2and 3 A), which were due to formation of insoluble fibrils (Fig. 3 B). From days 2–5, the levels of fibrils remained constant. However, there was a progressive decrease in the level of soluble native protein (Figs. 2 B and 3 A), attributed to the formation of higher molecular weight soluble aggregates, which eluted earlier during size exclusion chromatography than did native protein molecules (Fig. 2 B). During incubation of GAL at 37 °C, the elution profile was shifted to earlier time points, but minimally changed in shape and intensity (Fig.1 C), and fibrils were not detected (Fig. 3 B). These results suggest that the protein GAL was forming higher molecular weight soluble aggregates but was not precipitating from solution. Urea (1.0 m) reduced the thermodynamic stability of BIF and GAL (Fig. 5 and Table I). The unfolding curves for GAL in 1.0m urea were almost at the same positions as those for BIF in PBS alone. In addition, 1.0 m urea greatly accelerated the H-D exchange rate of both proteins (Fig. 6). Data are shown only for 8 h of incubation, because for the 18- and 24-h time points, the infrared spectra of both BIF and GAL indicated the presence of non-native protein aggregates containing intermolecular β-sheet (data not shown). During the 24-hour incubation, intermolecular β-sheet bands were not detected in spectra for samples of either protein in PBS alone or in 1.0 m sucrose (data not shown). The H-D exchange experiments were conducted at protein concentrations of 10 mg/ml. To determine how aggregates formed at this concentration compared with those formed in the initial experiments at 1 mg/ml protein concentration, 10 mg/ml solutions of BIF and GAL in 1.0m urea (prepared in H2O-PBS) were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Analysis of the BIF sample by size exclusion chromatography documented a substantial fraction of higher molecular weight soluble aggregates (data not shown). There was also a relatively high level of insoluble fibrils (Fig. 3 B) and a 40% loss of native, soluble protein (Fig. 3 A). With GAL, there was a 20% loss of native, soluble protein (Fig. 3 A) because of fibril formation (Fig. 3 B) but not formation of higher molecular weight soluble aggregates (data not shown). Our results document the fact that light chain BIF forms fibrils at 37 °C in vitro because of its low free energy of unfolding, relative to protein GAL, which neither formed amyloid deposits in vivo nor fibrils in vitro in PBS alone. Thus, fibril formation by intact light chains occurs because of the relatively low thermodynamic stability of the native state, as found in studies of recombinant VL, as well as transthyretin and lysozyme (8.Hurle M.R.

Blake C.C.F. Pepys M.B. Nature. 1997; 385: 787-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar). BIF also had a much greater rate of H-D exchange than GAL, indicating that BIF molecules have native state conformational fluctuations of greater amplitude (25.Englander S.W. Mayne L. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1992; 21: 243-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 26.Bai Y.W. Sosnick T.R. Mayne L. Englander S.W. Science. 1995; 269: 192-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). Thus, there is an increased probability that BIF molecules will be in the appropriate conformation to foster non-native intermolecular interactions when encountering neighboring molecules. From a state equilibrium viewpoint, as has previously been suggested for amyloid-forming variants of lysozyme, BIF at any instant in time has a greater fraction of partially folded species in its molecular population than does GAL (13.Booth D.R. Sunde M. Bellotti V. Robinson C.V. Hutchinson W.L. Fraser P.E. Hawkins P.N. Dobson C.M. Radford S.E. Blake C.C.F. Pepys M.B.

It is well established that non-native protein aggregates are formed from partially folded molecules, which are sparsely and transiently populated relative to the most compact native conformation with which they are in equilibrium (13.Booth D.R.

With the relatively unstable amyloidogenic protein variants, there are sufficiently high levels of partially folded molecules that, during the time scale for amyloid fibril formation of days to weeks or longer, fibrils can form even in nonperturbing environments. Thus, a rational strategy for inhibiting amyloid fibril formation is to use extrinsic factors to increase native state stability and increase the thermodynamic barrier between the most compact native state and aggregation-competent, partially folded species (27.Chang B.S.

With BIF, 1.0 m sucrose sufficiently increased the thermodynamic stability so that the resistance of this protein to amyloid fibril formation was equivalent to that of the nonpathological light chain GAL. Sucrose increases the thermodynamic stability of proteins because it is preferentially excluded from their surface, which increases the chemical potential of proteins (14.Lee J.C. Timasheff S.N. J.

Sucrose increases the free energy barrier between the native and partially or fully unfolded states, because the latter have greater surface area and, hence, greater increase in chemical potential than the native state (14.Lee J.C.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12884-12891Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Thus, sucrose shifts the equilibrium between states toward the most compact native state and away from aggregation-competent molecules (16.Kendrick B.S. Chang B.S. Arakawa T. Peterson B.

Because these effects are independent of protein properties, thermodynamic stabilization and inhibition of aggregation by sucrose is generally applicable to soluble, globular proteins (14.Lee J.C.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12884-12891Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Conversely, urea preferentially binds to proteins and lowers their chemical potential (15.Timasheff S.N. Adv. Protein Chem. 1998; 51: 356-432Google Scholar). Partially and fully unfolded states have a greater surface area for binding than the native state and, hence, are more greatly populated in urea than in buffer alone (15.Timasheff S.N. Adv. Protein Chem. 1998; 51: 356-432Google Scholar). In 1.0m urea, the thermodynamic stability and H-D exchange rate of GAL were rendered equivalent to those measured for BIF in PBS alone. During incubation at 1 mg/ml, this destabilization caused a loss of native GAL due to formation of soluble aggregates. Increasing protein concentration to 10 mg/ml led to the formation of amlyoid fibrils. Similar results were also noted with BIF. In general, the propensity and rate of forming non-native protein aggregates vary directly with protein concentration (29.Fink A.L. Fold. Design. 1998; 3: R9-R23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). This relationship, as well as destabilization by urea, may be important for the frequent renal deposition of light chain amyloid fibrils (6.Dhodapkar M.V. Merlini G. Solomon A. Hematol. Oncol. Clin. N. Am. 1997; 11: 89-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The protein GAL did not form deposits as amyloid in vivo, perhaps because the concentrations of GAL or urea in the extracellular space of the kidney were not sufficiently high. However, there may be cases in which the intrinsic thermodynamic stability of the light chain is low enough that fibril formation will be favored in the kidney because of destabilization by urea. Also, other factors such as relatively high concentrations of NaCl and acidic pH may contribute to renal fibril deposition (17.Garcia-Perez A. Burg M.B. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 1081-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 35.Myatt E.A. Westholme F.A. Weiss D.T. Solomon A. Schiffer M. Stevens F.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3034-3038Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In conclusion, amyloid fibril formation by light chains and other amyloidogenic proteins is predominantly controlled by the thermodynamic stability of the protein molecules. Thus, a rational therapeutic strategy to inhibit amyloidosis is to design ligands that bind with high affinity and specificity to the native protein (32.Miroy G.J. Lai K. Lashuel H.A. Petersen S.A.

Relative to the effects of 1.0 m sucrose, stoichiometric amounts these compounds greatly increase the thermodynamic stability of the native state and reduce the levels of partially and fully unfolded protein molecules (15.Timasheff S.N.

In this regard, naturally occurring stabilizing ligands have been shown to inhibit amyloid fibril formation by transthyretin (32.Miroy G.J. Lai K. Lashuel H.A. Petersen S.A. Stang C. Kelly J.W. Proc.

Dabora J.M. Gress J.O. Burke C.J. Linhardt R.J. Middaugh C.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 30-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). For most amyloidogenic proteins, high affinity ligands have not been identified but can be designed using combinatorial library screening and protein structure-based methods (e.g. Refs. 38.Luque I. Freire E. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 295: 100-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholarand 39.Gold L. Polisky B. Uhlenbeck O. Yarus M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 763-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). Prior to the development of these compounds, a powerful approach is the use of sucrose for a rapid test of the importance of thermodynamic stabilization for inhibiting fibril formation. This strategy is applicable to any amyloidogenic system for which the starting material is a structured, globular protein.

Mutants for Src42A , a Drosophila c- src protooncogene homolog, are described. Src42A functions in epidermal closure during both embryogenesis and metamorphosis. The severity of the epidermal closure defect in the Src42A mutant depended on the amount of Bsk activity, and the amount of Bsk activity depended on the amount of Src42A. Thus, activation of the Bsk pathway is required downstream of Src42A in epidermal closure. This work confirms mammalian studies that demonstrated a physiological link between Src and JNK."

Bordo D. Rizzi M. Tarricone C. Ascenzi P. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1997; 68: 29-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The homodimeric hemoglobin from the aerobic bacterium, Vitreoscilla, is transcribed under oxygen-limiting growth conditions (2.Wakabayashi S. Matsubara H. Webster D.A.

It is postulated that the protein acts as an oxygen carrier under hypoxic conditions and facilitates oxygen diffusion to the terminal oxidase complex. The hemoglobin in the eukaryotic green alga, Chlamydomonas eugametos, is expressed in response to activation of photosynthesis (4.Couture M. Chamberland H. St-Pierre B. Lafontaine J. Guertin M. Mol.

In Escherichia coli andSalmonella typhimurium, a two-domain flavo-hemoglobin is involved in detoxification of nitric oxide (7.Crawford M.J. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol.

Despite this wide array of the physiological functions, all the hemoglobins discovered so far are made of myoglobin-like subunits with a three-over-three α-helical sandwich motif (globin fold) (1.Bolognesi M. Bordo D. Rizzi M. Tarricone C. Ascenzi P. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1997; 68: 29-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar).Recently, we expressed and characterized a hemoglobin (HbN)1 fromMycobacterium tuberculosis that adds a new twist to the scope of the properties of invertebrate hemoglobins (10.Couture M. Yeh S.-R. Wittenberg B.A. Wittenberg J.B. Ouellet Y. Rousseau D.L. Guertin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11223-11228Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). HbN is a homodimeric protein. It displays extremely high oxygen binding affinity and cooperativity, with a Hill coefficient of approximately 2. The sequence alignment with hemoglobins from alga, protozoa, and cyanobacteria suggests that the proximal ligand is His, the distal ligand at the E7 position is Leu, and that at the B10 position is Tyr. To examine the structure of the heme pocket and thereby infer the function of this hemoglobin, we have measured the resonance Raman spectra of the wild type protein and the Tyr → Leu and Tyr → Phe mutants under a variety of oxidation and ligand binding states. The resonance Raman spectra reveal distal features that are unique among the hemoglobins and demonstrate the essential role of B10 Tyr in stabilizing the heme-bound ligands.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESRecombinant M. tuberculosis HbN was cloned, expressed, and purified to near homogeneity as described elsewhere (10.Couture M. Yeh S.-R. Wittenberg B.A. Wittenberg J.B. Ouellet Y. Rousseau D.L. Guertin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11223-11228Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The single amino acid substitution mutants of HbN (Y33L and Y33F) were prepared as described previously (10.Couture M. Yeh S.-R. Wittenberg B.A. Wittenberg J.B. Ouellet Y. Rousseau D.L. Guertin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11223-11228Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The protein was buffered at the desired pH with 50 mm Tris and CAPS at pH 7.5 and 10.5, respectively. For all of the experiments reported here, the protein concentration was 50 μm. The Raman measurements were made with previously described instrumentation (11.Wang J. Caughey W.S. Rousseau D.L. Feelisch M. Stamler J.S. Methods in Nitric Oxide Research. John Wiley & Sons Inc., New York1996: 427-454Google Scholar). The output at 406.7 nm from a krypton ion laser (Spectra Physics) was focused to an ∼30 μm spot (laser power ∼2 mW) on a rotating cell to prevent photo-damage to the sample. The acquisition time was about 30 min for each spectrum. The scattered light was collected at right angles to the incident beam and focused on the entrance slit of a 1.25 m polychromator (Spex) where it was dispersed and then detected by a charge-coupled device camera (Princeton Instruments).RESULTSThe general characteristics of resonance Raman spectra of heme proteins are well established (11.Wang J. Caughey W.S. Rousseau D.L. Feelisch M. Stamler J.S. Methods in Nitric Oxide Research. John Wiley & Sons Inc., New York1996: 427-454Google Scholar, 12.Hu S. Smith K.M. Frei H. Spiro T.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 12638-12646Crossref Scopus (463) Google Scholar). In the high frequency region of the spectrum between 1300 and 1700 cm−1, the oxidation state, spin state, and the axial coordination state of the iron at the center of the heme can be characterized. In particular, the ν2 mode, in the region between 1550 and 1600 cm−1, is sensitive to the iron spin state. The line in the 1475–1520 cm−1 region, assigned as the ν3mode, is sensitive to both the axial coordination and spin state of the iron. The strong line between 1350 and 1400 cm−1, assigned as the ν4 mode, is sensitive to the π-electron density of the porphyrin macrocycle and, therefore, the oxidation state of the iron. The frequency and intensity of these Raman lines are further modulated by the protein environment surrounding the heme and, therefore, provide useful structural information on heme proteins. In the low frequency region of the spectrum between 200 and 800 cm−1, the specific axial ligands coordinated to the prosthetic heme group can be identified by detecting iron-ligand stretching modes.Ligand-free Ferrous HbNThe high frequency resonance Raman spectrum of the wild type ferrous deoxy form of HbN, shown in Fig.1 A, displays a typical five-coordinate high spin pattern with the electron density line (ν4) appearing at 1356 cm−1 and the strong spin/coordination sensitive line (ν3) appearing at 1471 cm−1. In the low frequency region, shown in Fig.2 A, a strong line is detected at 226 cm−1 that is assigned as the iron-histidine (Fe−His) stretching mode. This confirms the prediction from the sequence alignment that histidine is the proximal ligand. The same spectra were obtained for the B10 Tyr → Leu and Phe mutants (data not shown). The frequency of the Fe−His stretching mode is significantly higher than that in any other globin (TableI) and indicates that, unlike other cooperative hemoglobins, there is no proximal strain in this hemoglobin.Figure 2The low frequency resonance Raman spectra of the wild type HbN.

A contribution from a six-coordinate low spin form developed as the pH was raised from 7.5 to 10.5 as indicated by an increase in intensity of the lines at 1501 and 1579 cm−1 for ν3 and ν2, respectively (Fig. 1 C). This is consistent with the optical absorption spectra, in which the intensities of bands at 410, 543, and 578 nm increase with respect to those at 406, 503, and 624 nm as the pH is increased. With H216O−H218O isotopic substitution at pH 10.5, two isotope sensitive lines were detected at 454 and 561 cm−1 in H216O, which shift to 423 and 533 cm−1, respectively, in H218O (Fig. 2 D). Based on the isotope shifts, both of these lines are assigned as Fe−OH stretching modes. The resonance Raman spectra of the B10 Tyr → Leu and Phe mutants of the ferric protein were also measured. In the B10 Tyr → Phe mutant, the line at 454 cm−1 totally disappeared leaving only the high frequency line, which appeared at about 552 cm−1 in H216O and shifted to 520 cm−1 in H218O (Fig.2 E). Associated with this change in the Fe–OH stretching mode, in the high frequency region of the spectrum, the high spin marker line at 1479 cm−1 is diminished in comparison with the low spin marker line at 1501 cm−1 (data not shown). The Raman spectrum of the B10 Tyr → Leu mutant is not detectable because of a high fluorescence background in this preparation (data not shown).O2-bound Ferrous HbNIn the resonance Raman spectrum of the wild type ferrous oxy-derivative, one line was detected at 560 cm−1 that had oxygen isotope sensitivity (Fig.3, A and C). In the difference spectrum, a positive peak at 563 cm−1 for16O2 is shifted to 542 cm−1 for18O2, in accord with the predicted shift for a Fe−O2 diatomic oscillator of 23 cm−1. As may be seen by inspection of Table I, this mode is lower in HbN than in any other hemoglobin. In the B10 Tyr → Leu mutant, the Fe−O2 stretching mode is located at 570 cm−1for 16O2 and shifted to 545 cm−1with 18O2 (Fig. 3, B andD). In the mutant, the Fe−O2 stretching mode has the same frequency as that observed in most other hemoglobins and myoglobins.Figure 3The low frequency resonance Raman spectra of the ferrous O2-bound forms of HbN.

The relative intensity of these two modes is independent of pH, concentration of the protein, and incident laser power. In the resonance Raman spectra of the B10 Tyr → Leu and Phe mutants, only one CO isotope sensitive line remained in the spectrum which was present at 500 cm−1 for the 12C16O derivative and at 489 cm−1 for the13C18O derivative (Fig. 4, B andD).Figure 4The low frequency resonance Raman spectra of the ferrous CO-bound forms of HbN.

In trace D, the signal at ∼1,000 cm−1 is assigned as the overtone of the Fe−CO stretching mode.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In the C−O stretching region of the wild type spectrum, CO-isotope sensitive lines were also detected (Fig.5). A strong line at 1916 cm−1 in 12C16O shifted to 1829 cm−1 in 13C18O. Two lines centered at about 1960 cm−1 in 12C16O derivative appeared as only a single line at 1870 cm−1 in the 13C18O derivative. We assign the lines centered at 1960 cm−1 as originating from a Fermi resonance coupled pair involving a C−O stretching mode and a porphyrin mode. Upon the isotope substitution, this coupling is lost so only a single line appears in the 13C18O derivative. Based on these results, we assign the two Fe−CO stretching modes at 535 and 500 cm−1 as being associated with C−O stretching frequencies of 1916 and 1960 cm−1, respectively.Figure 5The high frequency resonance Raman spectra of the ferrous CO-bound forms of HbN at pH 7.5.

Bordo D. Rizzi M. Tarricone C. Ascenzi P. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1997; 68: 29-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The homodimeric hemoglobin from the aerobic bacterium, Vitreoscilla, is transcribed under oxygen-limiting growth conditions (2.Wakabayashi S. Matsubara H. Webster D.A. Nature. 1986; 322: 481-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 3.Tsai P.S. Kallio P.T. Bailey J.E. Biotechnol. Prog. 1995; 11: 288-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). It is postulated that the protein acts as an oxygen carrier under hypoxic conditions and facilitates oxygen diffusion to the terminal oxidase complex. The hemoglobin in the eukaryotic green alga, Chlamydomonas eugametos, is expressed in response to activation of photosynthesis (4.Couture M. Chamberland H. St-Pierre B. Lafontaine J. Guertin M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 243: 185-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 5.Couture M. Guertin M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 779-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). It is proposed to be involved with the photosynthetic electron transfer chains. The leghemoglobins discovered in plants function as oxygen scavengers, preventing the oxidation of the O2-sensitive nitrogen-fixing machinery of the symbioticRhizobium bacteroids (6.Appleby C.A. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1984; 35: 443-478Crossref Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli andSalmonella typhimurium, a two-domain flavo-hemoglobin is involved in detoxification of nitric oxide (7.Crawford M.J. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12543-12547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 8.Kim S.O. Orii Y. Lloyd D. Hughes M.N. Poole R.K.

Despite this wide array of the physiological functions, all the hemoglobins discovered so far are made of myoglobin-like subunits with a three-over-three α-helical sandwich motif (globin fold) (1.Bolognesi M. Bordo D. Rizzi M. Tarricone C. Ascenzi P. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1997; 68: 29-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Recently, we expressed and characterized a hemoglobin (HbN)1 fromMycobacterium tuberculosis that adds a new twist to the scope of the properties of invertebrate hemoglobins (10.Couture M. Yeh S.-R. Wittenberg B.A. Wittenberg J.B. Ouellet Y. Rousseau D.L. Guertin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11223-11228Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). HbN is a homodimeric protein. It displays extremely high oxygen binding affinity and cooperativity, with a Hill coefficient of approximately 2. The sequence alignment with hemoglobins from alga, protozoa, and cyanobacteria suggests that the proximal ligand is His, the distal ligand at the E7 position is Leu, and that at the B10 position is Tyr. To examine the structure of the heme pocket and thereby infer the function of this hemoglobin, we have measured the resonance Raman spectra of the wild type protein and the Tyr → Leu and Tyr → Phe mutants under a variety of oxidation and ligand binding states. The resonance Raman spectra reveal distal features that are unique among the hemoglobins and demonstrate the essential role of B10 Tyr in stabilizing the heme-bound ligands. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESRecombinant M. tuberculosis HbN was cloned, expressed, and purified to near homogeneity as described elsewhere (10.Couture M. Yeh S.-R. Wittenberg B.A. Wittenberg J.B. Ouellet Y. Rousseau D.L. Guertin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11223-11228Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The single amino acid substitution mutants of HbN (Y33L and Y33F) were prepared as described previously (10.Couture M. Yeh S.-R. Wittenberg B.A. Wittenberg J.B. Ouellet Y. Rousseau D.L. Guertin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11223-11228Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The protein was buffered at the desired pH with 50 mm Tris and CAPS at pH 7.5 and 10.5, respectively. For all of the experiments reported here, the protein concentration was 50 μm. The Raman measurements were made with previously described instrumentation (11.Wang J. Caughey W.S. Rousseau D.L. Feelisch M. Stamler J.S. Methods in Nitric Oxide Research. John Wiley & Sons Inc., New York1996: 427-454Google Scholar). The output at 406.7 nm from a krypton ion laser (Spectra Physics) was focused to an ∼30 μm spot (laser power ∼2 mW) on a rotating cell to prevent photo-damage to the sample. The acquisition time was about 30 min for each spectrum. The scattered light was collected at right angles to the incident beam and focused on the entrance slit of a 1.25 m polychromator (Spex) where it was dispersed and then detected by a charge-coupled device camera (Princeton Instruments).

RESULTSThe general characteristics of resonance Raman spectra of heme proteins are well established (11.Wang J. Caughey W.S. Rousseau D.L. Feelisch M. Stamler J.S. Methods in Nitric Oxide Research. John Wiley & Sons Inc., New York1996: 427-454Google Scholar, 12.Hu S. Smith K.M. Frei H. Spiro T.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 12638-12646Crossref Scopus (463) Google Scholar). In the high frequency region of the spectrum between 1300 and 1700 cm−1, the oxidation state, spin state, and the axial coordination state of the iron at the center of the heme can be characterized. In particular, the ν2 mode, in the region between 1550 and 1600 cm−1, is sensitive to the iron spin state. The line in the 1475–1520 cm−1 region, assigned as the ν3mode, is sensitive to both the axial coordination and spin state of the iron. The strong line between 1350 and 1400 cm−1, assigned as the ν4 mode, is sensitive to the π-electron density of the porphyrin macrocycle and, therefore, the oxidation state of the iron. The frequency and intensity of these Raman lines are further modulated by the protein environment surrounding the heme and, therefore, provide useful structural information on heme proteins. In the low frequency region of the spectrum between 200 and 800 cm−1, the specific axial ligands coordinated to the prosthetic heme group can be identified by detecting iron-ligand stretching modes.Ligand-free Ferrous HbNThe high frequency resonance Raman spectrum of the wild type ferrous deoxy form of HbN, shown in Fig.1 A, displays a typical five-coordinate high spin pattern with the electron density line (ν4) appearing at 1356 cm−1 and the strong spin/coordination sensitive line (ν3) appearing at 1471 cm−1. In the low frequency region, shown in Fig.2 A, a strong line is detected at 226 cm−1 that is assigned as the iron-histidine (Fe−His) stretching mode. This confirms the prediction from the sequence alignment that histidine is the proximal ligand. The same spectra were obtained for the B10 Tyr → Leu and Phe mutants (data not shown). The frequency of the Fe−His stretching mode is significantly higher than that in any other globin (TableI) and indicates that, unlike other cooperative hemoglobins, there is no proximal strain in this hemoglobin.Table IThe frequencies of the iron-histidine (Fe-His), iron-hydroxide (Fe–OH −), iron-CO (Fe–CO) and iron–O2(Fe–O2) stretching modes of various heme-containing proteins determined by resonance Raman scattering.

https://openalex.org/W2023579322,"DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) is involved in joining DNA double-strand breaks induced by ionizing radiation or V(D)J recombination. The kinase is activated by DNA ends and composed of a DNA binding subunit, Ku, and a catalytic subunit, DNA-PKCS. To define the DNA structure required for kinase activation, we synthesized a series of DNA molecules and tested their interactions with purified DNA-PKCS. The addition of unpaired single strands to blunt DNA ends increased binding and activation of the kinase. When single-stranded loops were added to the DNA ends, binding was preserved, but kinase activation was severely reduced. Obstruction of DNA ends by streptavidin reduced both binding and activation of the kinase. Significantly, short single-stranded oligonucleotides of 3–10 bases were capable of activating DNA-PKCS. Taken together, these data indicate that kinase activation involves a specific interaction with free single-stranded DNA ends. The structure of DNA-PKCS contains an open channel large enough for double-stranded DNA and an adjacent enclosed cavity with the dimensions of single-stranded DNA. The data presented here support a model in which duplex DNA binds to the open channel, and a single-stranded DNA end is inserted into the enclosed cavity to activate the kinase.

Little is known about how DNA lesions are recognized and transduced into a signal for these cellular responses. In the case of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs)1 induced by ionizing radiation, recognition is critically important, because DSBs can lead to chromosomal fragmentation and cell death, or to chromosomal translocations and cancer.Ionizing radiation activates the c-Abl tyrosine kinase, which has undefined physiological functions (1.Kharbanda S.

Ionizing radiation also activates the ATM kinase and DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), which have homologous kinase domains. ATM phosphorylates p53 to induce cell cycle arrest or apoptosis (3.Giaccia A.J. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2973-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1170) Google Scholar). DNA-PK is required for the repair of DSBs produced by ionizing radiation and V(D)J recombination, the process that generates immunological diversity in antibodies and T cell receptors (4.Smider V. Chu G. Semin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Understanding how DNA-PK is activated by DSBs can establish a paradigm for how proteins signal the presence of DNA lesions.DNA-PK is a serine-threonine protein kinase consisting of DNA binding and catalytic subunits. The DNA binding subunit is the Ku protein, a heterodimer of 70 and 86 kDa that binds to DNA ends, nicks, and structures containing a transition fork between double-stranded DNA and two single strands (5.Mimori T.

DNA with blunt ends, 5′ overhanging ends, or 3′ overhanging ends activate DNA-PK with equal efficiency (14.Gottlieb T.M. Jackson S.P.

Supercoiled plasmid DNA fails to activate DNA-PK, but supercoiled plasmid DNA containing the NRE1 sequence from mouse mammary tumor virus was reported to activate the kinase (25.Giffin W. Torrance H.

Based on these studies, it was not clear what specific DNA structure was critical for the activation of DNA-PK.In these earlier studies, the DNA structures were tested with different enzyme preparations and a variety of protein substrates. Interpretations of the results were potentially confounded by several factors: DNA preparations may have contained contaminating DNA structures, and enzyme preparations often included Ku, which may have altered or obscured properties of the DNA structures upon binding. Therefore, to define precisely the DNA structure required for kinase activation, we undertook a systematic study of a homogeneous preparation of DNA-PKCS with a series of gel-purified DNA structures in the absence of any cofactors or contaminating proteins.

Chu G. Semin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Understanding how DNA-PK is activated by DSBs can establish a paradigm for how proteins signal the presence of DNA lesions. DNA-PK is a serine-threonine protein kinase consisting of DNA binding and catalytic subunits. The DNA binding subunit is the Ku protein, a heterodimer of 70 and 86 kDa that binds to DNA ends, nicks, and structures containing a transition fork between double-stranded DNA and two single strands (5.Mimori T.

The catalytic subunit of DNA-PK (DNA-PKCS) is a 465-kDa polypeptide (10.Hartley K.O. Gell D. Smith G.C.M. Zhang H. Divecha N. Connelly M.A. Admon A. Lees-Miller S.P. Anderson C.W. Jackson S.P.

The catalytic domain of DNA-PKCS is mutated in the severe combined immunodeficiency mouse (17.Blunt T. Gell D. Fox M. Taccioli G.E. Lehman A.R. Jackson S.P. Jeggo P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Additional studies have suggested that the catalytic kinase activity of DNA-PK is required for rejoining DSBs both in intact cells (22.Kurimasa A. Kumano S. Boubnov N. Story M. Tung C.S. Peterson S.

DNA with blunt ends, 5′ overhanging ends, or 3′ overhanging ends activate DNA-PK with equal efficiency (14.Gottlieb T.M. Jackson S.P. Cell. 1993; 72: 131-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar), whereas double-stranded DNA with hairpin ends fails to activate the kinase (24.Smider V. Rathmell W.K. Brown G. Lewis S. Chu G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6853-6858Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Supercoiled plasmid DNA fails to activate DNA-PK, but supercoiled plasmid DNA containing the NRE1 sequence from mouse mammary tumor virus was reported to activate the kinase (25.Giffin W. Torrance H. Rodda D. Prefontaine G. Pope L. Hache R. Nature. 1996; 380: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 26.Giffin W. Kwast-Welfeld J. Rodda D.J. Prefontaine G.G. Traykova-Andonova M. Zhang Y.

Based on these studies, it was not clear what specific DNA structure was critical for the activation of DNA-PK. In these earlier studies, the DNA structures were tested with different enzyme preparations and a variety of protein substrates. Interpretations of the results were potentially confounded by several factors: DNA preparations may have contained contaminating DNA structures, and enzyme preparations often included Ku, which may have altered or obscured properties of the DNA structures upon binding. Therefore, to define precisely the DNA structure required for kinase activation, we undertook a systematic study of a homogeneous preparation of DNA-PKCS with a series of gel-purified DNA structures in the absence of any cofactors or contaminating proteins.

We report here that B. subtilis HprK forms homo-oligomers constituted most likely of eight subunits.

A positive cooperativity was also detected for the binding of natural nucleotides or their 2′(3′)-N-methylanthraniloyl derivatives, in either phosphorylation or fluorescence experiments. Most interestingly, quenching of the HprK tryptophan fluorescence by using either iodide or acrylamide revealed a heterogeneity of tryptophan residues within the population of oligomers, suggesting that the enzyme exists in two different conformations.

Ghosh S. Roseman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1964; 52: 1067-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Being part of a protein phosphorylation chain, HPr is phosphorylated by enzyme I at His-15, in the presence of phosphoenolpyruvate (2.Gassner M. Stehlik D. Schrecker O. Hengstenberg W. Maurer W.

In Gram-positive bacteria, the phosphoryl-carrier protein HPr is also phosphorylated at a regulatory serine (Ser-46), by the HPr kinase (HprK) in the presence of ATP (3.Deutscher J. Engelmann R.

This ATP-dependent phosphorylation of HPr mediated by HprK regulates expression of several catabolic genes and therefore plays a central role in carbon catabolite repression (9.Saier M.J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1996; 138: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). A recently discovered HPr-like protein of Bacillus subtilis, catabolite repression HPr (Crh) (10.Galinier A. Haiech J. Kilhoffer M.C. Jaquinod M. Stülke J. Deutscher J. Martin-Verstraete I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Signal transduction in carbon catabolite repression continues with a phosphorylation-mediated protein-protein interaction between HPr or Crh and the transcriptional repressor/activator CcpA (catabolite control protein A) (12.Deutscher J.

The ATP-dependent phosphorylation at Ser-46 is a prerequisite for the interaction of either HPr or Crh with CcpA. The resulting protein complexes, CcpA·Ser(P)-HPr or CcpA·Ser(P)-Crh, specifically interact with an operator site called catabolite responsive element (11.Galinier A. Deutscher J. Martin-Verstraete I.

Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 333-340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) hprK, the gene encoding HprK, was only recently identified and cloned during the B. subtilis sequencing program. Preliminary characterization of the purified recombinant B. subtilis HprK showed that it was indeed able to specifically phosphorylate HPr or Crh (5.Galinier A. Kravanja M. Engelmann R.

Sequence comparison revealed that this enzyme is found not only in most Gram-positive bacteria, but also in some pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria like Bordetella pertussis, Treponema pallidum, andNeisseriae. The HprKs constitute a new family of protein kinases which do not contain the domain structure typical for eukaryotic serine/threonine/tyrosine kinases (17.Taylor S.S. Buechler J.A. Yonemoto W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 971-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar, 18.Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 80: 225-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2604) Google Scholar). Instead, an ATP-binding motif, called the P-loop (or A-motif) and typically found in some nucleotide-binding proteins such as F1-ATPase or p21 ras (19.Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4257) Google Scholar, 20.Saraste M. Sibbald P.R. Wittinghofer A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 430-434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1748) Google Scholar), has been detected in the primary structure of this new class of protein kinases. Since disruption of the hprK gene leads to severe growth defects of the B. subtilis mutant strain, HprK might constitute a potential target for new antimicrobial agents in pathogenic bacteria (5.Galinier A. Kravanja M. Engelmann R. Hengstenberg W. Kilhoffer M.C. Deutscher J. Haiech J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1823-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Recent experiments showed that HprK is a bifunctional enzyme which also possesses Ser(P)-HPr phosphatase activity (8.Kravanja M. Engelmann R. Dossonnet V. Blüggel M. Meyer H.E. Frank R. Galinier A. Deutscher J. Schnell N. Hengstenberg W. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The molecular switch between the phosphatase and the kinase activities appears to be controlled by the presence of low molecular weight effectors. In the presence of FBP and ATP, the kinase activity of HprK is predominant, whereas the phosphatase activity becomes prevalent when the concentration of inorganic phosphate rises (8.Kravanja M. Engelmann R. Dossonnet V. Blüggel M. Meyer H.E. Frank R. Galinier A. Deutscher J. Schnell N. Hengstenberg W. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Tryptophan fluorescence provides a very sensitive and widely used tool to monitor the binding of effectors, especially nucleotides and their derivatives, to numerous nucleotide-binding proteins (21.Eccleston J.F.

A. 1998; 95: 9831-9836Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Since the molecular mechanism underlying HPr phosphorylation by the recently discovered HprK was poorly understood, the binding properties of HprK were first investigated by following the variation of its intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence in the presence of different effectors. Our preliminary results suggested that HprK can bind nucleotides or FBP in a cooperative manner and a thorough characterization of its kinetic properties was therefore carried out. This report describes the results obtained from both biochemical and biophysical experiments, and it unambiguously shows that HprK is a homo-oligomeric enzyme which exists in two different conformations. This latter property leads most likely to the positive cooperativity mechanism reported here for the binding of either nucleotides or FBP. Furthermore, it is shown that the enhancement of HPr phosphorylation by FBP essentially occurs at low concentrations of both ATP and HprK. N-Methylanthraniloyl (Mant) derivatives of nucleotides were prepared by reaction of nucleotides withN-methylisatoic anhydride as described by Hiratsuka (26.Hiratsuka T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 742: 496-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar) except that the obtained derivatives were purified on DEAE-cellulose column (27.Woodward S.K. Eccleston J.F. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 422-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) by elution with a linear gradient of 10 to 800 mm triethylammonium bicarbonate. The fluorescent nucleotides eluted far after the unreacted nucleotides and the excess of N-methylisatoic acid. The pooled fractions were dried under vacuum and remaining triethylamine was removed by three successive additions and evaporations of methanol. Purity and homogeneity of the products were tested by both thin-layer chromatography according to Ref. 26.Hiratsuka T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 742: 496-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar and reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography using a C-18 column and elution with a 0 to 60% gradient of acetonitrile in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.0. The concentration of fluorescent nucleotide was determined by UV absorbance at 255 nm for MantADP (ε = 23,300m−1 cm−1) and MantGDP (ε = 22,600 m−1 cm−1). HPr(His)6 and HprK(His)6 were purified on Ni-NTA-agarose columns as described previously (5.Galinier A. Kravanja M. Engelmann R. Hengstenberg W. Kilhoffer M.C. Deutscher J. Haiech J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1823-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 10.Galinier A. Haiech J. Kilhoffer M.C. Jaquinod M. Stülke J. Deutscher J. Martin-Verstraete I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8439-8444Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Proteins were stored at −80 °C in 20 mm ammonium bicarbonate. Size exclusion chromatography experiments were performed on a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 FPLC column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In all experiments, the equilibration buffer contained 20 mm Bis-Tris propane, pH 7.0, and 200 mm NaCl. The samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 15,000 rpm at 4 °C prior to loading 500-μl aliquots onto the column at a protein concentration of 170 μm. The system was calibrated under the same conditions using the Bio-Rad gel filtration standard kit. Proteins present in the eluted fractions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Analytical ultracentrifugation was carried out on a Beckman Optima XL-A equipped with an An60Ti four-hole rotor and a cell with two-channel 12-mm path length centerpieces. Radial scans of absorbance at 280 nm were performed with the sample buffer used as blank. Sedimentation-velocity experiments were performed at 30,000 rpm and 4 °C. Apparent sedimentation coefficients of the species present in the cell were obtained by the time derivative method of W. Stafford (28.Stafford W.F. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar) and the SVEDBERG program of Philo (29.Philo J.S. Schuster T.M. Laue T.M. Modern Analytical Ultracentrifugation: Acquisition and Interpretation of Data for Biological and Synthetic Polymer Systems. Birkhausen, Boston1994: 156-170Crossref Google Scholar). Equilibrium-sedimentation centrifugations were carried out at 5,600, 8,000, and 12,000 rpm at 4 °C. The high molecular weight aggregates that accumulated at the bottom of the cells were not taken into account. Determination of the molecular mass was performed with the software package provided by Beckman. Data were analyzed for average molecular mass in terms of a single homogeneous species according to the equation: A r = A 0 exp [H M (x 2 −x 02)] + E withH = (1 − v bar ρ) ω2/2 RT, where A r is the absorbance at radius x, A 0 the absorbance at a reference radius x 0,v bar the partial specific volume of HprK estimated from its sequence (0.735 ml g−1 at 4 °C), ρ the solvent density (1.009 g ml−1), ω the angular velocity, R the gas constant, T the absolute temperature, M the molecular mass, and E the baseline offset. Phosphorylation of HPr(His)6 by the HprK(His)6 was carried out as described previously (5.Galinier A. Kravanja M. Engelmann R. Hengstenberg W. Kilhoffer M.C. Deutscher J. Haiech J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1823-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). A typical 20-μl phosphorylation mixture contained 30 μm purified HPr(His)6, 350 nm purified HprK(His)6, 50 mmTris/HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, and 50 μm ATP, unless otherwise stated in the figure legend. The reaction mixture was incubated for the time specified in the figure legends. In all cases, a kinetic experiment was performed under the same conditions to ensure that an initial rate of phosphorylation was maintained during the time interval chosen. The phosphorylation reaction was stopped by adding 100 mm EDTA to the assay mixtures before loading the samples onto a nondenaturing 12.5% polyacrylamide gel. On this type of gels, phosphorylated HPr is well separated from the unphosphorylated protein (30.Deutscher J. Kessler U. Hengstenberg W. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 1203-1209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, the gel was stained with Coomassie Blue and scanned in a Densitometer SI (Molecular Dynamics); results were analyzed with the ImagQuant V1.2 software (Molecular Dynamics). For each sample, the percent of Ser(P)-HPr was automatically calculated by integrating the area of the lower band relatively to that of the upper band, corresponding to phosphorylated and unphosphorylated HPr, respectively. All experiments were performed at 25 ± 0.1 °C using a Photon Technology International Quanta Master I spectrofluorometer. The measurements were automatically corrected for intensity fluctuation in lamp emission. All spectra were corrected for buffer fluorescence. Fluorescence measurements were routinely carried out after dilution of HprK (1 μm final concentration) and equilibration for 10 min in 2 ml of buffer containing 25 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 8.2, and 0.1 mmEDTA (except where stated otherwise). Increasing concentrations of nucleotides, Mant-derivatives, or FBP were then added and the emission fluorescence was scanned in the range of either 310–380 nm for nucleotides or FBP or 310–530 nm for Mant-derivatives, upon excitation at 295 nm. Binding of ligands was monitored by the variation of tryptophan-intrinsic fluorescence of HprK (between 310 and 380 nm) produced after addition of increasing concentrations of effectors, and corrections for both the variation of volume and the inner-filter effect of the ligands were performed under the same conditions by usingN-acetyltryptophanamide. Fluorescence resonance-energy transfer between tryptophan residues of HprK and bound Mant-nucleotide derivatives was monitored by the appearance of a fluorescence emission peak between 400 and 530 nm, characteristic of bound nucleotide analogues. Peak integration was carried out at each ligand concentration with the Felix 1.21 software (Photon Technology International) and the observed changes in fluorescence intensity or fluorescence resonance-energy transfer were used for the calculation of ligand affinity. Curve fitting of the data was performed using either the Graphit 2.11 software (Erithacus Software) for the monophasic binding of effectors as described in Ref. 31.Divita G. Goody R.S. Gautheron D.C. Di Pietro A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13178-13186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, or the MacCurvefit 1.0.8 software for the cooperative binding of effectors. Quenching experiments in the presence of either potassium iodide or acrylamide were performed by successive additions of aliquots from concentrated stock solutions. The potassium iodide stock solution also contained 0.1 mm potassium thiosulfate in order to prevent I3− formation, which would quench tryptophan fluorescence emission (32.Divita G. Di Pietro A. Deleage G. Roux B. Gautheron D.C. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3256-3262Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). A control experiment conducted with similar concentrations of KCl indicated that ionic strength did not significantly modify the fluorescence emission of HprK. In the case of acrylamide, the inner-filter effect at the emission wavelength was corrected according to Calhoun et al. (33.Calhoun D.B. Vanderkooi J.M. Englander S.W. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 1533-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The fluorescence quenching data in the presence of either acrylamide or iodide were analyzed according to the Stern-Volmer equation (34.Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 672-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar, 35.Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 114: 199-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1625) Google Scholar) which, when all quenching is collisional (no static quenching), is:F o/F = 1 +K sv[Q], where F oand F are the fluorescence intensities in the absence or presence of quenchers, respectively, K sv the collisional Stern-Volmer constant, and [Q] the quencher concentration. The plot of F o/F versus [Q] is linear if the population of emitting fluorophores is homogenous. In contrast, a downward curvature is observed for a heterogenous population of fluorophores, and a linear plot can then be obtained by using the modified Stern-Volmer relationship introduced by Lehrer (36.Lehrer S.S. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 3254-3263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1679) Google Scholar):F o/(F o − F) = 1/([Q]fa K Q) + 1/f a where f a is the fractional number of accessible fluorophores and K Q their collisional constant. The plot ofF o/(F o − F)versus 1/[Q] allows a graphical determination of f a. Analysis of the HprK oligomerization state was first undertaken by size exclusion chromatography. At the elution volume expected for the monomer (36 kDa), a very small peak was observed the composition of which has not been determined. The major peak containing HprK eluted at a volume corresponding to about 260 kDa, indicating that this enzyme is highly oligomeric (data not shown). Analysis of the chromatograms revealed a small shoulder at the leading edge of the peak, suggesting that some aggregation occurred during the experiments. No noticeable change in the protein elution volume was observed when HprK was incubated with ATP-Mg or FBP prior loading onto the column. In order to obtain additional information on the size of HprK, an analytical ultracentrifugation was conducted on the protein. First, homogeneity was tested by a sedimentation-velocity experiment. A major population (about 85%) was observed with an apparent sedimentation coefficient ofs 20 °C = 9.2. Minor populations of higher molecular weight were also observed. The quaternary structure of HprK was studied by sedimentation-equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation. The experiment was performed at three different ultracentrifugation speeds and repeated three times. Each of the 9 data sets analyzed separately gave a single homogeneous species of average molecular mass 240–320 kDa. A simultaneous fit was then performed yielding an average mass of 274,200 Da, corresponding to 7.6 times the calculated molecular mass of the monomer, i.e. 36,068 (Fig.1). This result suggests that the native form of B. subtilis HprK is an octamer, although the possibility of a more rarely observed heptamer cannot be ruled out. In order to investigate the effect of FBP on HprK, the initial rate of HPr phosphorylation was analyzed at low concentrations of both HprK and ATP and increasing concentrations of FBP (Fig.2). The results show that no stimulation of HPr phosphorylation was observed at FBP concentrations below 1 mm. However, when the FBP concentration was raised above 1 mm, HPr phosphorylation by HprK was strongly stimulated, and after a sharp increase, the activity reached a plateau at about 5 mm FBP. The sigmoidal curve in Fig. 2 suggests that binding of FBP to HprK, HPr, or to both proteins follows a positive cooperativity mechanism. Evidence for direct binding of FBP to HprK was provided by the results presented in Fig. 3. We took advantage that HprK contains a single tryptophan (Trp-235) in its sequence (SWISS-PROT accession number 034483) to study FBP binding by intrinsic fluorescence measurements. In the absence of FBP and with the excitation wavelength set at 295 nm, HprK exhibited a fluorescence emission spectrum characteristic of a rather accessible tryptophan residue (λmax around 340 nm) (Fig. 3 A, lower curve). A progressive increase of the FBP concentration from 0.5 to 12 mm enhanced the fluorescence intensity of HprK (Fig.3 A, upper curves). When the ratio of the HprK fluorescence intensity measured in the presence and absence of FBP (F/F o) was plotted as a function of the FBP concentration, a sigmoidal curve was obtained confirming that FBP binding to HprK follows a positive cooperativity mechanism (Fig.3 B). Curve fitting of the data allowed estimation of the parameters for binding of FBP to HprK (F max/F o = 1.46 ± 0.0062; nH = 2.19 ± 0.067 and apparentK D = 6.03 mm). The apparent discrepancy between the maximal concentrations of FBP required to stimulate the kinase activity in phosphorylation tests (Fig. 2) and to saturate the FBP-binding site of HprK in fluorescence experiments (Fig.3 B) might be due to different temperatures used (25 and 37 °C for fluorescence and kinetic experiments, respectively) but also to differences in buffer composition, for instance, the lack of magnesium in the fluorescence experiments. Magnesium was omitted from the fluorescence buffer since it produced a slow precipitation of the protein during the experiment. Addition of agents known to stabilize proteins, such as 20% glycerol or use of different buffers, did not solve this problem. As a consequence, the fluorescence experiments were carried out in the absence of magnesium. The effect of FBP on HprK fluorescence seems to be very specific, as neither fructose 1-phosphate nor fructose 6-phosphate had any significant effect on the fluorescence emission spectrum of the kinase (Fig. 3 B). This indicates that either these two compounds do not bind to HprK or that they do bind to the enzyme but without inducing any conformational change. Accordingly, fructose 1-phosphate and fructose 6-phosphate were without effect on the phosphorylation activity of HprK (data not shown (6.Reizer J. Hoischen C. Titgemeyer F. Rivolta C. Rabus R. Stülke J. Karamata D. Saier Jr., M.H. Hillen W. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 1157-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar)). The positive cooperativity displayed by HprK for binding of FBP implies that this enzyme contains at least two classes of FBP-binding sites. Whether the binding of FBP to (a) high affinity site(s) induced a change in the affinity of a second class of FBP-binding sites within the same HprK oligomer (by sequential interaction (37.Koshland D.E.J. Nemethy G. Filmer D. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 365-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (2200) Google Scholar)) or whether this reflected an equilibrium between two oligomer conformations of the enzyme (by concerted symmetry (38.Monod J. Wyman J. Changeux J.-P. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 88-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (6150) Google Scholar)) was not known. To decide between the two alternatives, the accessibility of tryptophan residues was assessed by using either acrylamide or iodide. As shown in Fig. 4 A, addition of increasing amounts of iodide, a compound known to quench only surface accessible tryptophan residues (39.Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 3rd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1983Crossref Google Scholar), to native HprK caused a progressive quenching of intrinsic fluorescence. However, a downward curvature was observed in the Stern-Volmer plot for iodide concentrations above 80 mm. This curvature indicates that the population of tryptophan residues is heterogenous. This was confirmed by the modified Stern-Volmer plot (Fig. 4 B), which allowed estimation of the fraction of tryptophan residues accessible to iodide, f a, found to be about 0.5. The iodide effect was not caused by any denaturation of HprK, since the enzyme preincubation with 0.2 m potassium iodide for 1 h prior to measuring its activity by diluting it 1000-fold in an HPr kinase assay mixture did not alter HprK activity (data not shown here). Preincubation of HprK with 20 mm FBP tended to flatten the curve of the Stern-Volmer plot which was reflected by an increase in the fraction of tryptophan residues accessible to iodide (f a = 0.61). In a control experiment, denatured HprK, obtained by incubation with 6 m guanidine hydrochloride for 16 h, was also found to give a linear Stern-Volmer plot, but under these conditions all the tryptophan residues became accessible to iodide (f a of about 1). The same experiment was conducted by using acrylamide, a nonpolar quencher which have facilitated access to some of the buried tryptophans (39.Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 3rd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1983Crossref Google Scholar). In this case, however, the presence of FBP did not significantly change the fraction of tryptoph"

The alpha(2)-adrenergic receptor agonists, UK14304 and epinephrine (EPI), were unable to raise cytosolic levels of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP(3)) or Ca(2+) but potentiated the [Ca(2+)](i) rises evoked by other agonists that act through stimulation of phospholipase C (thrombin or platelet-activating factor) or stimulation of Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release (CICR) in the absence of InsP(3) generation (thimerosal or thapsigargin). In addition, alpha(2)-adrenergic stimulation resulted in a 20% lowering in the cytosolic cAMP level. In platelets treated with G(salpha)-stimulating prostaglandin E(1), EPI increased the Ca(2+) signal evoked by either phospholipase C- or CICR-stimulating agonists mainly through modulation of the cAMP level. The stimulating effects of UK14304 and EPI on platelet Ca(2+) responses, and also on integrin alpha(IIb)beta(3) exposure and platelet aggregation, were abolished by pharmacological stimulation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, and these effects were mimicked by inhibition of this activity. In permeabilized platelets, UK14304 and EPI potentiated InsP(3)-induced, CICR-mediated mobilization of Ca(2+) from internal stores in a similar way as did inhibition of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. In summary, a G(ialpha)-mediated decrease in cAMP level appears to play a major role in the platelet-activating effects of alpha(2A)-adrenergic receptor stimulation. Thus, in platelets, unlike other cell types, occupation of the G(ialpha)-coupled alpha(2A)-adrenergic receptors does not result in phospholipase C activation but rather in modulation of the Ca(2+) response by relieving cAMP-mediated suppression of InsP(3)-dependent CICR."

Although TNF has the ability to induce apoptosis in some cell systems and in some tumors, TNF carries out a majority of its function through the stimulation of gene expression. A large number of genes have been identified that are responsive to TNF (1.Kronke M. Schutze S. Scheurich P. Pfizenmaier K. Immunol. Ser. 1992; 56: 189-216PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Gordon H.M. Kucera G. Salvo R. Boss J.M. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 4021-4027PubMed Google Scholar). Such genes include cytokines, transcription factors, adhesion molecules, and structural proteins. The mechanics of TNF-mediated gene induction has concentrated on the factor NF-κB (3.Schutze S. Wiegmann K. Machleidt T. Kronke M. Immunobiology. 1995; 193: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). NF-κB represents a diverse family of homologous proteins that interact to form a variety of heterodimers, which appear to have distinct functions (4.Perkins N.D. Schmid R.M. Duckett C.S. Leung K. Rice N.R. Nabel G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1529-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 5.Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5515) Google Scholar). The major form is composed of the p50 and p65 subunits. NF-κB is held in an inactive state in the cytoplasm by the inhibitor IκB (reviewed in Ref. 5.Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5515) Google Scholar). Upon TNF signaling, IκB is phosphorylated by the IκB kinase, IKKβ (6.Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar), polyubiquitinated, and degraded (5.Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev.

The separation of IκB from the NF-κB complex reveals a nuclear localization sequence on NF-κB that allows its nuclear transport and gene activation. In most genes, NF-κB alone is not sufficient to activate gene expression, and numerous other factors appear to be involved in mediating expression. In some cases, a complex of proteins, which includes at least one NF-κB molecule, forms a compact regulatory unit that has been termed an enhanceosome (8.Thanos D. Du W. Maniatis T. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1993; 58: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 9.Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 83: 1091-1100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). However, in other genes, such as the monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 gene (MCP-1) (10.Ping D. Jones P.L.

Biol. 1997; 17: 6970-6981Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), the regions controlling gene expression are separated by more than 2 kb of DNA. Such systems are likely to require more extensive and complex interactions for which little is known. Monocyte chemoattractant proteins (MCP) are a family of proinflammatory C-C chemokines that recruit macrophages, monocytes, T cells, and basophils to regions of infection and disease (12.Baggiolini M.

In vivo genomic footprinting (IVGF) and mutational analyses of the upstream region of murine MCP-1 have identified two regulatory regions, proximal and distal, that are separated by ∼2.4 kb (10.Ping D.

Immunol. 1999; 162: 727-734PubMed Google Scholar). The proximal regulatory region contains three sites that became occupied upon TNF induction of MCP-1: a site with partial homology to a κB-binding site, termed κB-3, site B, and a GC box. The κB-3 site does not bind NF-κB family members (10.Ping D. Jones P.L. Boss J.M. Immunity. 1996; 4: 455-469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, in the human gene, κB-3 has homology to a IFN-γ response element and was shown to be required for IFN-γ induction (23.Zhou Z.H. Chartuvedi L. Han P. Aras S. Li Y. Kolattukudy E. Ping D. Boss J.M. Ransohoff R.M. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2908-2916Google Scholar), suggesting that this region might display IFN-γ responsiveness in the mouse. Mutation of site B and κB-3 did not affect TNF induction; however, mutation of the GC box proved to be critical for regulation by both TNF and PDGF (33.Ping D. Boekhoudt G. Boss J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31909-31916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We have recently found that both Sp1 and Sp3 can bind to this site in vitro (33.Ping D. Boekhoudt G. Boss J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31909-31916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), but it is not clear which of these factors function in vivo. Sp1 was one of the first sequence-specific eukaryotic transcription factors purified and cloned (34.Kadonaga J.T. Carner K.R. Masiarz F.R. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 51: 1079-1090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1244) Google Scholar, 35.Dynan W.S. Saffer J.D. Lee W.S. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4915-4919Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Sp1-binding sites (GGGGCGGGG) are found in numerous genes and in genes lacking TATA boxes, suggesting that it may provide a link to the recruitment of TFIID to TATAless promoters (36.Charron D. Adv.

Sp1 has also been found to interact with NF-κB in vitro andin vivo (38.Pazin M.J. Sheridan P.L. Cannon K. Cao Z. Keck J.G. Kadonaga J.T. Jones K.A. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 39.Perkins N.D. Edwards N.L. Duckett C.S. Agranoff A.B. Schmid R.M. Nabel G.J.

Biol. 1994; 14: 6570-6583Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). However, despite the number of genes containing Sp1 sites, little information is available for genes that “require” Sp1 for expression. To address this issue, Marin et al. (41.Marin M. Karis A. Visser P. Grosveld F. Philipsen S. Cell. 1997; 89: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar) constructed ES cells that contained a targeted disruption of the Sp1 gene. This mutation proved to be an embryonic lethal when homozygous in a mouse, demonstrating a critical role for Sp1 in development. The second Sp1 allele was knocked out as well, creating an ES cell line with both genes disrupted. The only major change in gene expression observed in earlySp1−/− embryos was a decrease in theMeCP-2 gene. MeCP-2 encodes a protein that functions in the maintenance of gene silencing at regions of methylated DNA. All other genes examined were close to their normal levels of expression, suggesting some compensating mechanism for Sp1. The role of Sp1 in cytokine induced expression was not examined. The MCP-1 distal regulatory region contains four elements as follows: site A, κB-1, κB-2, and the HS site. Site A is constitutively occupied irrespective of MCP-1 gene expression and is required for maximal induction by TNF (10.Ping D. Jones P.L. Boss J.M. Immunity. 1996; 4: 455-469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The HS site is sensitive to hypermethylation by DMS in cells treated with TNF. The proteins that interact with sites A and HS are currently unknown. The two κB sites are essential for TNF induction and in murine fibroblasts bind p50/p65, NF-κB heterodimer (32.Ping D. Bodkhoudt G.H. Rogers E.M. Boss J.M. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 727-734PubMed Google Scholar). With the exception of site A, the induction of MCP-1 by TNF leads to the occupancy and therefore assembly of both distal and proximal regulatory regions by factors already present in the nucleus and those that are transported into the nucleus, such as NF-κB (10.Ping D. Jones P.L. Boss J.M. Immunity. 1996; 4: 455-469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The coordinate occupancy of both the distal and proximal regions by TNF suggests that interactions between the proteins that bind to these sites may occur that promote factor assembly and/or chromatin remodeling. To investigate factor assembly of both the proximal and distal regions, it is important to identify the factor(s) that could bind to the GC boxin vivo and to determine their role in promoter/regulatory region assembly. In this report, the Sp1−/− ES cells were differentiated into a fibroblast-like cell line and used to study the mechanism of TNF induction on MCP-1 in the absence of functional Sp1. Additionally, a Drosophila cell line system, which lacks endogenous Sp1, was used to determine the minimal mammalian components that were necessary for MCP-1expression. The results show that Sp1 is required for maximalMCP-1 expression. In the absence of Sp1, assembly of the distal regulatory NF-κB region was drastically inhibited, suggesting communication between these two regions. Moreover, the minimal mammalian components necessary for expression in Drosophilacells included Sp1 and the p65 NF-κB subunit. Sp3, a member of the Sp1 family of DNA transcription factors and found to be expressed at normal levels in Sp1−/− cells, could substitute for Sp1 in the Drosophila system. Together, these results provide a genetic proof of the involvement of Sp1 inMCP-1 expression and suggest interactions between Sp1 and NF-κB that span 2.5 kb of DNA. NIH3T3 and BALB/3T3 murine fibroblasts were obtained from the ATCC. Both of these cell lines respond to TNF induction with similar kinetics (10.Ping D. Jones P.L. Boss J.M. Immunity. 1996; 4: 455-469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 32.Ping D. Bodkhoudt G.H. Rogers E.M. Boss J.M. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 727-734PubMed Google Scholar). Fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum (HyClone, Inc., Logan, UT), 1 mmglutamine, and antibiotics. Sp1−/− ES cells were passaged twice on 0.1% gelatin-coated culture dishes, each to about 70% confluency to reduce the MEF feeder cells (mitomycin C-treated) on which the ES cells were maintained. ES colonies were mildly trypsinized from the gelatin-coated dishes, and cell aggregates were carefully removed and added to 150-mm bacteriological Petri dishes containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media + minimum Eagle's medium nonessential amino acids with 15% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and 0.5% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide. Cell aggregates were cultured for 4–6 days with one passage carried out by gravity sedimentation of the aggregates in 50-ml tubes, followed by supernatant aspiration and addition of fresh media. Aggregates were again collected by gravity sedimentation and seeded into 60-mm tissue culture dishes coated with collagen (as recommended by the supplier; Collaborative Biomedical Products, Inc., Bedford, MA) in α- minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 1 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 4 μg/ml insulin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Adherent cells were cultured for 7–14 days with media changes every 2 days. The cultures were then subcultured every 3–4 days allowing at each subculture for cell attachment for 4–6 h followed by media replacement to remove any residual non-adherent cells. By three serial subcultures, the cells exhibited a uniform, fibroblast-like appearance.Sp1−/− cells were passaged on collagen-coated plates in the above conditions. Recombinant human TNF was obtained from Genzyme, Inc. (Cambridge, MA), and was added to the cultures at a final concentration of 500 units/ml for the indicated time. The Drosophila melanogaster Schneider cell line (ATCC, CRL 1963) was maintained in Drosophila cell media (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with fetal bovine serum (10% v/v), antibiotics, and 1 mm glutamine. Cells were grown at room temperature. MCP-1 transcriptional CAT reporter plasmids have all been described previously (10.Ping D. Jones P.L. Boss J.M.

NF-κB p65 and p50 subunitDrosophila expression plasmids (9.Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 83: 1091-1100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar) were provided by A. Neish (Emory University). A similar set of NF-κB mammalian expression vectors were provided by Dr. T. Collins (Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston). A Drosophila Sp1 expression vector was provided by R. Tjian (University of California, Berkeley). The mammalian equivalent was created by cloning the Sp1 cDNA into the pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen, Inc.) expression vector. Transient transfections of NIH3T3 cells were carried out as described previously (10.Ping D. Jones P.L. Boss J.M. Immunity. 1996; 4: 455-469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 32.Ping D. Bodkhoudt G.H. Rogers E.M. Boss J.M. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 727-734PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly 107cells/transfection were grown to 70% confluence, collected, washed, resuspended in 0.8 ml of RPMI, and transfected by electroporation at 290 V, 960 microfarads. All assays contained 20 μg of theMCP-1 reporter DNA and 1 μg of pSV2AlkPhos, an alkaline phosphatase reporter vector (transfection efficiency control plasmid). Cultures were harvested at 48 h post-transfection after receiving TNF or media for the indicated time. BALB/3T3 cells were not used for transient transfections because of their poor transfection efficiency (10.Ping D. Jones P.L. Boss J.M.

Schneider cells were transfected by electroporation as above. Cultures were harvested 48 h post-transfection. In these assays, 20 μg of the indicated reporter was used with 10 μg of each of the indicated expression vectors (p65, Sp1, or Sp3) and 1 μg of the alkaline phosphatase reporter control. The NF-κB p50 expression vector was added in the indicated amount. Promoterless CAT reporter plasmid DNA (pCATbasic) was added to bring the total amount of DNA transfected to 50 μg/assay. IVGF assays were done exactly as described (10.Ping D. Jones P.L. Boss J.M. Immunity. 1996; 4: 455-469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 32.Ping D. Bodkhoudt G.H. Rogers E.M. Boss J.M. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 727-734PubMed Google Scholar). For MCP-1, IVGF assays of the coding strand of the distal regulatory region and the noncoding strand for the proximal regulatory region are shown as these are the most informative strands. IVGF of the distal region and proximal regions were performed in BALB/3T3 cells using the JEκB3-1, -2, and -3 JE5-7, -8, and -9 primer sets as described previously (10.Ping D. Jones P.L. Boss J.M. Immunity. 1996; 4: 455-469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 32.Ping D. Bodkhoudt G.H. Rogers E.M. Boss J.M. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 727-734PubMed Google Scholar). NIH3T3 cells were not used due to a sequence polymorphism in one of theirMCP-1 alleles that prevents interpretation of the footprint. The extension, PCR, and labeling primers used for IVGF of the coding strand of IP-10 gene were as follows: 5′CAGCACTTGGGTTCATGGTGCT, 5′-GGATGTCTCTCAGCGGTGGATGAA, and 5′-AGCGGTGGATGAAGCGCTTCTCGAG, respectively. Nuclear extracts were prepared from BALB/3T3 or the Sp1−/− cell lines as described previously (10.Ping D. Jones P.L. Boss J.M.

In each case, 20, 10-cm plates were used. The standard DNA binding reaction contained 4 μg of nuclear extract, 0.6 μg of poly[dI·dC]-poly[dI·dC], 250 ng of denatured sonicated salmon sperm DNA, 15 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10% glycerol, 50 mm KCl, 0.12 mm EDTA, 5 μg of bovine serum albumin, 12 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, and the indicated amount of competitor DNA. Labeled probe was added after a 10-min preincubation, and the reactions were incubated for an additional 30 min on ice. The sequence of the coding strand of the MCP-1 GC box-specific probe used in the EMSAs was as follows: 5′GCACCCTGCCTGACTCCACCCCCCTGGCTTACAA. Competitor DNA for consensus Sp1 and AP-1 sites were 5′ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAG and 5′CGCTTGATGACTCAGCCGGAA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.; Valencia, CA), respectively, where the underlined bases represent the consensus sites. The sequence for the κB-binding site in the distal region used as a probe spanned κB-2 and is 5′ACTGCCCTCAGAATGGGAATTTCCACGCTCTTATC. Nonspecific DNA competitors encoded site A and site B of the MCP-1 gene are 5′AGAACTGCTTGGCTGCAGGCCCAGCATCTGGAGCTCACATT and 5′TGATGCTACTCCTTGGCACCAAGCACCCTG, respectively. NF-κB p65, p50, Sp1, and Sp3 antibody supershift assays were carried out by adding 1 μl of antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) to the reaction mixture 5 min prior to the addition of the labeled probe. Samples were separated by electrophoresis in a 5% polyacrylamide gel (49:1, acrylamide:bisacrylamide) at 4 °C with recirculating buffer and analyzed by autoradiography. RNA was isolated from subconfluent plates using the Nonidet P-40 lysis procedure as described previously (10.Ping D. Jones P.L. Boss J.M. Immunity. 1996; 4: 455-469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Twelve μg of RNA were separated on denaturing formaldehyde gels, blotted, and probed with random primed and labeled cDNA encoding MCP-1 or glyceraldehyde dehydrogenase (GAPDH) following standard procedures (10.Ping D. Jones P.L. Boss J.M. Immunity. 1996; 4: 455-469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 32.Ping D. Bodkhoudt G.H. Rogers E.M. Boss J.M. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 727-734PubMed Google Scholar). RT-PCR analysis was performed using 0.5 μg of total RNA in an assay kit from Perkin-Elmer, Inc. RT-PCR primers for IP-10 were as follows: mIP-10-5, 5′TCTGCCTCATCCTGCTGGGTCT, and mIP-10-3, 5′CTTGATAACCCCTTGGGAAGATGGTG. GAPDH primers were as follows: mGAP-5, 5′CAGTATGACTCCACTCACGGCA, and mGAP-3, 5′CAGATCCACGACGGACACAT. PCR conditions (30 cycles) included 0.5 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 60 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C. Our previous work suggested a role for Sp1 in both TNF- and PDGF-inducedMCP-1 expression (10.Ping D. Jones P.L. Boss J.M. Immunity. 1996; 4: 455-469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 32.Ping D. Bodkhoudt G.H. Rogers E.M. Boss J.M. J.

However, without direct genetic evidence, several important questions about the function of Sp1 in this system could not be answered. These included the following: is Sp1 essential for the expression of MCP-1; does Sp1 control assembly of the proximal regulatory region; and does Sp1 influence the assembly of the distal regulatory region? The creation of ES cells homozygous for an Sp1-targeted disruption provided an opportunity to obtain a genetic correlation between Sp1 andMCP-1 expression (41.Marin M. Karis A. Visser P. Grosveld F. Philipsen S. Cell. 1997; 89: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, theSp1−/− genotype resulted in an embryonic lethal. To obtain cell lines that could be used to linkMCP-1 and Sp1, ES cells containing a homozygous disruption of the Sp1 gene were differentiated in culture. After supplementing the media with basic fibroblast growth factor and insulin, cells with a fibroblast-like appearance emerged and were passaged. These cells will be referred to asSp1−/− cells. To characterize the Sp1−/− cells, Sp1 expression was examined, and the ability of these cells to respond to TNF was evaluated by examining components of the TNF-signaling pathway. Both alleles of the Sp1 gene in theSp1−/− cell line produce a truncated protein with a molecular mass of 65 kDa (41.Marin M. Karis A. Visser P. Grosveld F. Philipsen S. Cell. 1997; 89: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). The truncated Sp1 protein lacks the DNA binding and activation domains. A Western blot containing lysates prepared from wild-type NIH3T3 andSp1−/− cells was stained with antisera to Sp1 (Fig. 1 A). The results show the expected sizes, demonstrating that wild-type (90 kDa) Sp1 is not present in the Sp1−/− cell line. During induction of gene expression by TNF, the NF-κB inhibitor IκB is phosphorylated, ubiquitinated, and degraded. This process allows NF-κB to translocate to the nucleus. To determine if this process is active in the Sp1−/− cells, the cells were treated with TNF, and a whole cell lysate was prepared and analyzed by Western blotting for the presence of IκB. After 10 min the presence of IκB is diminished, suggesting that the signaling pathway is intact (Fig.1 B). The rapid reappearance of IκB is also normal and is a result of TNF-induced expression of the IκB gene (43.Ito C.Y. Kazantsev A.G. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3787-3792Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Finally, the ability of NF-κB subunits to translocate to the nucleus following TNF treatment was examined. Nuclear extracts prepared fromSp1−/− cells showed that the nuclear concentration of NF-κB p50 and p65 increased following exposure to TNF (Fig. 1 C). Moreover, the transcription factor Sp3, which is not known to be affected by TNF, showed no increase in nuclear concentration. Together, these data demonstrate that the TNF signaling pathway is intact and is functional in Sp1−/− cells. To determine if the loss of Sp1 affects the ability of MCP-1 to be induced by TNF, a Northern blot was carried out on wild-type BALB/3T3 and Sp1−/− cells. As expected, in the wild type, MCP-1 was induced rapidly and maintained expression over the time course of the assay (Fig.2). However, in theSp1−/− cells, the levels of MCP-1were severely compromised (Fig. 2). Thus, Sp1 is required for maximal expression of MCP-1. The low levels of expression suggest an Sp1-independent pathway or that another factor is substituting for Sp1. To determine if the loss of expression was due to Sp1, theSp1 cDNA was cloned into a mammalian expression vector. This clone was transiently transfected into theSp1−/− cells. After 36 h, the cells were treated with TNF. In comparison to wild-type NIH3T3 cells, MCP-1induction by TNF was partially restored (da"
https://openalex.org/W2056837489,"Human involucrin (hINV) mRNA level and promoter activity increase when keratinocytes are treated with the differentiating agent, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). This response is mediated via a p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent pathway that targets activator protein 1 (Efimova, T., LaCelle, P. T., Welter, J. F., and Eckert, R. L. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 24387–24395). In the present study we examine the role of various PKC isoforms in this regulation. Transfection of expression plasmids encoding the novel PKC isoforms δ, e, and η increase hINV promoter activity. In contrast, neither conventional PKC isoforms (α, β, and γ) nor the atypical isoform (ζ) regulate promoter activity. Consistent with these observations, promoter activity is inhibited by the PKCδ-selective inhibitor, rottlerin, but not by Go-6976, an inhibitor of conventional PKC isoforms, and novel PKC isoform-dependent promoter activation is inhibited by dominant-negative PKCδ. This regulation appears to be physiologically important, as transfection of keratinocytes with PKCδ, -e, or -η increases expression of the endogenous hINV gene. Synergistic promoter activation (≥100-fold) is observed when PKCe- or -η-transfected cells are treated with TPA. In contrast, the PKCδ-dependent response is more complex as either activation or inhibition is observed, depending upon PKCδ concentration."

Conventional nitrone- and nitroso-based spin traps are not capable of trapping NO as stable radical adducts, and nitromethane is an effective spin trap only at very alkaline pH values (15.Reszka K.J.

The diethyldithiocarbamate (DETC) ferrous complex is a commonly used spin trap for NO (16.Vedernikov Y.P. Mordvintcev P.I. Malenkova I.V. Vanin A.F. Eur. J.

NO is produced by the nitric oxide synthase-catalyzed oxidation ofl-arginine. Ultimately, NO is oxidized to nitrite and nitrate. Although the nitrite is generally believed to be a fairly stable product of NO oxidation, Samouilov et al. (18.Samouilov A. Kuppusamy P. Zweier J.L. Arch. Biochem.

They also indicated that the conversion rate of nitrite to NO was too slow to be directly measured at physiological pH (18.Samouilov A. Kuppusamy P. Zweier J.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 357: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). However, Hiramoto et al. (19.Hiramoto K. Tomiyama S. Kikugawa K. Free Rad. Res. 1997; 27: 505-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) reported that the coexistence of Fe2+-dithiocarbamate complexes and nitrite produced a triplet EPR spectrum which corresponded to that of the dithiocarbamate-Fe2+-NO complex even at physiological pH.Although it is widely believed that Fe2+-dithiocarbamate complexes specifically react with NO to form dithiocarbamate-Fe2+-NO complex, its production from nitrite by (MGD)2Fe2+ may lead to misinterpretation regarding the actual presence of NO. Nitrite in biological systems originates as an oxidation product of endogenous NO, as a food component (20.Forman D. Al-Dabbagh S. Doll R. Nature. 1985; 313: 620-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), and as the reduction product of nitrate by facultative anaerobic bacteria (21.Sasaki T. Matano K. J. Food Hyg. Soc. Jpn. 1979; 20: 363-369Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 22.Ishiwata H. Tanimura A. Ishidate M. J. Food Hyg. Soc. Jpn. 1975; 16: 89-92Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 23.Tannenbaum S.R. Weisman M. Fett D. Food Cosmet. Toxicol. 1976; 14: 549-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is important to investigate any reaction between nitrite and the Fe2+-dithiocarbamate complex at physiological pH. In this study, EPR spectroscopy was utilized to investigate whether (MGD)2Fe2+complex produces (MGD)2Fe2+·NO in the presence of nitrite under anaerobic conditions.DISCUSSIONIron dithiocarbamate complexes such as DETC (12.Mordvintcev P.

Co-existence of these iron complexes and NO leads to an intense three-line EPR signal at room temperature. The (DETC)2Fe2+·NO complex is very hydrophobic, which is a limitation in its use in vivo (13.Obolenskaya M.Yu. Vanin A.F. Mordvintcev P.I. Mülsch A. Decker K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Physiol. 1998; 274: G857-G862PubMed Google Scholar).Nitrite in biological systems is known to be derived mainly from diet and as the oxidation product of NO, which is synthesized by nitric oxide synthases (NOS) from l-arginine. In 1997, Hiramotoet al. (19.Hiramoto K. Tomiyama S. Kikugawa K. Free Rad. Res. 1997; 27: 505-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) reported the appearance of the EPR spectrum of the dithiocarbamate-Fe2+-NO radical adduct in the presence of nitrite after prolonged incubation. If this were true, it would require a careful interpretation of biological data because the formation of the dithiocarbamate-Fe2+-NO complex would not always indicate the systemic production of NO, but could also detect systemic nitrite.However, the mechanisms for the formation of dithiocarbamate-iron-NO complex from dithiocarbamate-iron complex and nitrite have not been thoroughly investigated. In the present investigation, we explore the reaction mechanisms for the formation of the (MGD)2Fe2+·NO complex from nitrite and the water soluble dithiocarbamate-iron complex, (MGD)2Fe2+. As determined with the NO-electrode (Fig. 2), nitrite can produce NO at acidic pH because acidified nitrite can undergo disproportionation to produce NO (67.Williams D.L.H. Nitrosation. Cambridge University Press, New York1988Google Scholar), 3NO2−+2H+⇌2NO+NO3−+H2OEquation 1 The rate of NO production from 1 mm nitrite at pH 4.0 was calculated to be 1.3 × 10−7m/s, which was in good agreement with the literature value (1.7 × 10−7m/s) (18.Samouilov A. Kuppusamy P. Zweier J.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 357: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Although no NO was detected with an NO-electrode at neutral pH, the triplet EPR spectrum of the (MGD)2Fe2+·NO complex was generated with time (Fig. 3). The rate for the production of NO from nitrite at pH 7.4 was calculated to be 4.1 × 10−8m/s utilizing EPR quantitation of the rate of formation of (MGD)2Fe2+·NO as a measure of the rate of NO formation. However, if all NO were generated by spontaneous decomposition of nitrite via Equation 1, the rate of NO production at pH 7.4 would be 6.9 × 10−11m/s (18.Samouilov A. Kuppusamy P. Zweier J.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 357: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). This value was 1000 times less than the observed rate of NO formation. This difference clearly indicated that another NO generation pathway must exist at neutral pH in the presence of the (MGD)2Fe2+ complex and nitrite.Next, we investigated the individual components of the (MGD)2Fe2+ complex for their effect on the generation of NO from nitrite. As shown in Figs. 4, 5, and 6, the rate of NO production was first-order in the concentration of nitrite, MGD, and hydrogen ion, respectively. However, it was second-order in iron concentration (Fig. 7).When Fe2+ is added to MGD, the (MGD)2Fe2+ complex is formed under anaerobic conditions, Fe2++2MGD→(MGD) 2Fe2+Equation 2 When nitrite is introduced into the solution containing the (MGD)2Fe2+ complex at neutral pH, (MGD)3Fe3+, which is an oxidized form of (MGD)2Fe2+, appears (Fig. 8). We propose that (MGD)2Fe2+ reacts with nitrite, possibly as a transient Fe3+-nitric oxide complex (68.Yonetani T. Yamamoto H. Erman J.E. Leigh Jr., J.S. Reed G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 2447-2455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and then oxidizes (MGD)2Fe2+ to (MGD)3Fe3+, (MGD) 2Fe2++NO2−→H+MGD (MGD) 3Fe3+·NO+OH−Equation 3 The ferric-NO complex, upon reduction by excess (MGD)2Fe2+, will form the (MGD)2Fe2+·NO complex, (MGD) 3Fe3+·NO+(MGD) 2Fe2+ Equation 4 →(MGD) 2Fe2+·NO+(MGD) 3Fe3+If the reduction of (MGD)3Fe3+ is the rate-limiting step, then the net reaction between nitrite and (MGD)2Fe2+ complex can be expressed by adding Equations 3 and 4, 2 (MGD) 2Fe2++NO2−+MGD+H+→Equation 5 (MGD) 3Fe3++(MGD) 2Fe2+·NO+OH−Then, the rate of (MGD)2Fe2+·NO complex formation (v) is expressed as, v=k·[(MGD) 2Fe2+] 2·[NO2−]·[MGD]·[H+]Equation 6 The (MGD)2Fe2+ complex concentration is proportional to iron (Equation 2) because MGD is present in excess (more than 5 times the [Fe2+]). Accordingly, the rate law of Equation 6 accounts for the results of Figs. Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7.These results demonstrate that: 1) the reaction of nitrite and (MGD)2Fe2+ complex can produce (MGD)2Fe2+·NO complex via the reduction of nitrite by the (MGD)2Fe2+ complex; and 2) the rate for the formation of (MGD)2Fe2+·NO complex is a function of [NO2−], [MGD], [H+], and the square of [Fe2+]. On the basis of these results, we propose a mechanism for (MGD)2Fe2+−NO complex production from nitrite under anaerobic conditions (SchemeFS1).Figure FS1Proposed mechanism for the generation of the ( MGD )2Fe2+· NO complex from nitrite.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The plasma nitrite concentration was reported to be as high as 100 μm by the Griess method after lipopolysaccharide administration in rats (69.Kamisaki Y. Wada K. Ataka M. Yamada Y. Nakamoto K. Ashida K. Kishimoto Y. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1362: 24-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The concentration of (MGD)2Fe2+ complex in the blood of an animal during the quantitation of NO is initially estimated to be 0.01–5.71 mm (14.Komarov A. Mattson D. Jones M.M. Singh P.K. Lai C.-S.

Pharmacol. 1999; 33: 78-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.3 B, the (MGD)2Fe2+·NO EPR spectra increased with time in the presence of 100 μm nitrite and 0.5 mm (MGD)2Fe2+ complex. This data clearly demonstrates that the observed (MGD)2Fe2+·NO EPR spectrum does not necessarily indicate genuine NO production, but can also detect nitrite when the (MGD)2Fe2+ complex is introduced into an animal treated with the endotoxin depending on the local nitrite and Fe2+ (MGD)2 concentrations.We have previously demonstrated that under aerobic conditions, (MGD)2Fe2+ rapidly air oxidizes to form reactive oxygen species capable of oxidizing some nitrogen-containing compounds to nitric oxide (Table I) (27.Tsuchiya K. Jiang J.J. Yoshizumi M. Tamaki T. Houchi H. Minakuchi K. Fukuzawa K. Mason R.P. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1999; 27: 347-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We have now demonstrated that under anaerobic conditions, (MGD)2Fe2+ reduces nitrite to form (MGD)2Fe2+·NO at physiological pH values.In vivo, these two reactions will compete with each other. Both of these reactions will also compete with the trapping of authentic NO by (MGD)2Fe2+. Which of these reactions will dominate in vivo will depend, in large measure, on the relative concentrations of molecular oxygen, nitrite, and NO ([O2] ≥ [NO2−] ≫ [NO]) as well as the various reaction rates of (MGD)2Fe2+ (Table I).In summary, the development of the (MGD)2Fe2+·NO complex from biological samples containing nitrite does not necessarily indicate the presence of genuine NO. Special attention to this fact is needed to correctly interpret results obtained by the use of the (MGD)2Fe2+ complex for the detection of NO from nitrite-containing samples. If all nitrite originates from nitric oxide, then the biological interpretations of nitrite-dependent (MGD)2Fe2+·NO complex formation will not change except for the time course, which may be artificially extended. On the other hand, if diet is the source of nitrite, then even more serious misinterpretations of biological significance may result. In any case, the formation of the (MGD)2Fe2+·NO complex cannot uncritically be taken as evidence for the presence of NO in biological systems. Nitric oxide (NO)1 has many important physiological roles which include that of a cytotoxic mediator of the immune system, regulation of vasomotor tone in the cardiovascular system, and as a neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (1.Palmer R.M.J. Ferrige A.G. Moncada S. Nature. 1987; 327: 524-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (9260) Google Scholar, 2.Collier J. Vallance P. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1989; 10: 427-431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). NO is thought to be identical to the endothelium-derived relaxing factor (1.Palmer R.M.J. Ferrige A.G. Moncada S. Nature. 1987; 327: 524-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (9260) Google Scholar), and its insufficiency is believed to contribute to the pathogenesis of vascular disease such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, and myocardial ischemia. As a result, much attention has been focused on the potential therapeutic ability of nitrovasodilators (e.g. nitroglycerin and nitroprusside) (3.Joseph J. Kalyanaraman B. Hyde J.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 926-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and the anti-cancer drug hydroxyurea (4.Jiang J.J. Jordan S.J. Barr D.P. Gunther M.R. Maeda H. Mason R.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 1081-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) to release NO. In order to understand the mechanisms by which NO, a diffusable free radical with a short lifetime, mediates various biological processes, accurate methods for its measurement are required. Several methods for the quantitation of NO such as chemiluminescence (1.Palmer R.M.J. Ferrige A.G. Moncada S. Nature. 1987; 327: 524-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (9260) Google Scholar), methemoglobin formation (5.Ignarro L.J. Buga G.M. Wood K.S. Byrns R.E. Chaudhuri G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 9265-9269Crossref PubMed Scopus (4299) Google Scholar), and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy of nitrosyl-metal complexes (6.Greenberg S.S. Wilcox D.E. Rubanyi G.M. Circ. Res. 1990; 67: 1446-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) have been developed (7.Archer S. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). Production of NO can also be indirectly assessed by measuring the nitric oxide oxidation product, nitrite, with the Griess reaction. EPR spectroscopy is the only specific general technique available for the detection and measurement of radical production, but has severe quantum mechanical limitations for diatomic molecules. EPR methods have been developed which stabilize NO as a polyatomic adduct using endogenous and exogenous spin traps (8.Korth H.-G. Sustmann R. Lommes P. Paul T. Ernst A. de Groot H. Hughes L.

Conventional nitrone- and nitroso-based spin traps are not capable of trapping NO as stable radical adducts, and nitromethane is an effective spin trap only at very alkaline pH values (15.Reszka K.J.

https://openalex.org/W2064097956,"Thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) mediate hormone action by binding to DNA response elements (TREs) and either activating or repressing gene expression in the presence of ligand, T3. Coactivator recruitment to the AF-2 region of TR in the presence of T3 is central to this process. The different TR isoforms, TR-β1, TR-β2, and TR-α1, share strong homology in their DNA- and ligand-binding domains but differ in their amino-terminal domains. Because TR-β2 exhibits greater T3-independent activation on TREs than other TR isoforms, we wanted to determine whether coactivators bound to TR-β2 in the absence of ligand. Our results show that TR-β2, unlike TR-β1 or TR-α1, is able to bind certain coactivators (CBP, SRC-1, and pCIP) in the absence of T3 through a domain which maps to the amino-terminal half of its A/B domain. This interaction is specific for certain coactivators, as TR-β2 does not interact with other co-factors (p120 or the CBP-associated factor (pCAF)) in the absence of T3. The minimal TR-β2 domain for coactivator binding is aa 21–50, although aa 1–50 are required for the full functional response. Thus, isoform-specific regulation by TRs may involve T3-independent coactivator recruitment to the transcription complex via the AF-1 domain. Thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) mediate hormone action by binding to DNA response elements (TREs) and either activating or repressing gene expression in the presence of ligand, T3. Coactivator recruitment to the AF-2 region of TR in the presence of T3 is central to this process. The different TR isoforms, TR-β1, TR-β2, and TR-α1, share strong homology in their DNA- and ligand-binding domains but differ in their amino-terminal domains. Because TR-β2 exhibits greater T3-independent activation on TREs than other TR isoforms, we wanted to determine whether coactivators bound to TR-β2 in the absence of ligand. Our results show that TR-β2, unlike TR-β1 or TR-α1, is able to bind certain coactivators (CBP, SRC-1, and pCIP) in the absence of T3 through a domain which maps to the amino-terminal half of its A/B domain.

Thyroid hormone receptors (TRs)1 belong to the superfamily of nuclear receptors and contain at least five discrete domains: 1) the amino-terminal A/B domain containing AF-1 function; 2) the DNA-binding or C domain, which is highly conserved among nuclear receptors; 3) the hinge region or D domain, where corepressors bind; 4) the ligand-binding or E domain; and 5) the carboxyl-terminal AF-2 or F domain (1.Truss M.

TR acts as a transcription factor on thyroid hormone response elements (TREs) in the absence and presence of its ligand, triiodothyronine (T3) (Ref. 2.Lazar M.A. Endocr.

On positively regulated TREs (e.g. growth hormone, malic enzyme, myosin heavy chain-α), gene expression is repressed in the absence of T3 and stimulated when T3binds to the TR (6.Sap J. Munoz A.

In contrast, on negatively regulated genes (e.g. TSH α und β subunits, myosin heavy chain-β), gene expression is activated in the absence of ligand and repressed in the presence of ligand (9.Wondisford F.E.

A fourth isoform, α-2, does not bind T3 and may inhibit the function of other TRs. The different isoforms of the TR are derived from two different genes, c-erbA-α and c-erbA-β, found on different mammalian chromosomes. TR-α1 and α2 are generated from the c-erbA-α locus by alternative RNA splicing of carboxyl-terminal exons (12.Lazar M.A. Hodin R.A. Darling D.S. Chin W.W. Mol.

Whereas TR-α1 and TR-β1 are expressed ubiquitously (19.Langlois M.F. Zanger K. Monden T. Safer J.D. Hollenberg A.N. Wondisford F.E. J. Biol.

Kaulbach H. Zakaria M. Radovick S. Liberman M.C. Wondisford F.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104 (in press)Google Scholar). Within the TR-β2 amino terminus are two distinct domains (n-terminal and c-terminal) that have been shown to mediate ligand-independent activation on positive and negative TREs, respectively (18.Sjoberg M. Vennstrom B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4718-4726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Langlois M.F. Zanger K. Monden T. Safer J.D. Hollenberg A.N. Wondisford F.E. J. Biol.

Two corepressors, Nuclear receptorCoRepressor (NCoR) and SilencingMediator of Retinoic and Thyroid hormone receptors (SMRT), have been shown to bind to the hinge region of the TR in the absence of ligand (3.Horlein A.J. Näär A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamei Y. Söderström M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1995; 377: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1699) Google Scholar, 4.Chen J.D. Evans R.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1701) Google Scholar). These corepressors mediate ligand-independent repression on positive TREs, probably through deacetylation of histones (23.Alland L. Muhle R. Hou H.J. Potes J. Chin L. Schreiber-Agus N. DePinho R.A.

Binding of the ligand results in release of the corepressor and recruitment of coactivators. Over the last years a number of coactivators have been described that interact with the TR, including the CREBBinding Protein, CBP (26.Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B.

The ligand-independent activation of transcription by the TR-β2 isoform could be mediated by binding of these cofactors to the amino terminus (AF-1 domain) of the receptor. This could explain the greater ligand-independent activation of TR-β2 compared with TR-β1 in some transfection systems. We therefore investigated the interaction of coactivators with the A/B (AF-1) domain of TR isoforms. The TRE constructs contain two copies of an idealized TRE (DR+4, LYS, PAL) upstream of a minimal thymidine kinase promoter (109 bp of 5′-flanking DNA of the herpes simplex TK promoter fused to the luciferase reporter gene (35.Hollenberg A., N. Monden T. Wondisford F.E J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14274-14280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar)). The cDNAs encoding the full-length coactivators CBP, SRC-1, pCIP (generous gift from Dr. W. Chin, Lilly Corp., Indianapolis, IN), p120, and pCAF (generous gift from Dr. Y. Nakatani, National Institutes of Health) were placed into the pSG5 expression vector. The cDNAs encoding human TR-α1, TR-β1, and TR-β2 were inserted into the expression vector pSG5, which employs the SV40 early promoter (36.Breathnach R. Harris B.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 7119-7136Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The human TR amino termini were obtained by polymerase chain reaction amplification of human full-length TR cDNAs (TR-α1 and TR-β1) or genomic DNA (TR-β2) and ligated in-frame into an expression vector containing five copies of the GAL4 DNA binding domain. The TR-β2 amino-terminal deletion constructs were made using polymerase chain reaction to introduce an EcoRI site at the 5′-end and anXbaI site at the 3′-end of the constructs. The amino-terminal cDNAs were cloned in-frame with the GAL4 DNA as anEcoRI-XbaI fragment in the GAL4 vector (37.Cohen R.N. Wondiford F.E. Hollenberg A.N. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1567-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The reporter used for heterologous expression systems was UAS-TK fused upstream of the luciferase gene (38.Daimont B.D. Wagner R.L. Apriletti J.W. Stallcup M.R. Kushner P.J. Baxter J.D. Fletterlick R.J. Yamamoto K.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3343-3350Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). The integrity of all constructs was confirmed by restriction endonuclease digestion and dideoxy sequencing. Transient transfection studies were performed in JEG cells. Transfections were performed in 12-well plates on subconfluent cells, using the calcium-phosphate technique without glycerol shock. In the 12-well format, 1 μg of reporter with 0.2 μg of TR-construct and 0.33 μg of coactivator-pSG5 per well were transfected. Sixteen hours after transfection, culture medium was replaced, and 10 nm T3 was added as indicated. 36–40 h after transfection, cells were harvested and assayed for luciferase activity. Luciferase activity is expressed as -fold stimulation compared with transfection with the empty vector alone. The amino-terminal deletion constructs used in the transfection assays were removed from the GAL4 vector using restriction digest (EcoRI and XbaI) and ligated in-frame with GST in the pGEX4T2 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Recombinant proteins were synthesized in JM 109 bacteria and purified on glutathione-Sepharose resin under nondenaturing conditions, and in the presence of protease inhibitors (CompleteTM, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), GST proteins were analyzed on SDS-PAGE before use in the assay to ensure equivalence of preparations.35S-labeled co-activators (CBP, SRC-1, pCIP, p120, or pCAF) were generated in an in vitro transcription/translation system (TNT, Promega Biotech, Madison, WI). As a control, an unprogrammed translation with 35S-methionine was employed. After a 30-min exposure of the translated proteins to the indicated GST protein and extensive washing with NET (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) at 4° C, the proteins trapped by the resin were resolved on SDS-PAGE and detected by autoradiography. Relative binding of the coactivators was quantified by densitometry. In the absence of ligand (T3), TR-β2 has an increased capacity to activate gene expression on negative TREs, when compared with the other TR isoforms (19.Langlois M.F. Zanger K. Monden T. Safer J.D. Hollenberg A.N. Wondisford F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24927-24933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We first wanted to determine whether this ability of TR-β2 is mediated by its unique amino terminus. As shown in Fig. 1 A, transient transfection studies of the isolated amino terminus of TR-β2 fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain exhibits greater ligand-independent activation than the amino termini of TR-α1 or TR-β1 (7-fold versus 0.5- or 2.0-fold, respectively) on a GAL4 reporter (UAS-TK). Thus, the TR-β2 amino terminus contains a T3-independent activation function in transfected JEG cells. Similar results were obtained in CV-1 cells (data not shown). To investigate whether the amino terminus of TR-β2 functionally interacts with coactivator proteins, we cotransfected the isolated TR amino termini-GAL4 constructs and cDNAs encoding different coactivators: CBP, SRC-1, pCIP, p120, and pCAF. As shown in Fig.1 B, cotransfection of CBP, SRC-1, or pCIP expression vectors with the amino terminus of TR-β2 enhanced transcriptional activation 42-, 50-, and 43-fold, respectively. In contrast, cotransfection of these coactivators with the amino-terminal domains of the TR-α1 or TR-β1 did not increase reporter gene expression over base-line activity observed with a GAL4 “empty vector.” Furthermore, cotransfecting p120 or pCAF with the TR-β2 amino terminus did not augment its activity, indicating that the TR-β2 amino terminus specifically interacts with certain coactivators (CBP, SRC-1, and pCIP). To evaluate whether these coactivators bind to the TR-β2 amino terminus in vitro, we next performed GST interaction assays. As shown in Fig. 2 A, radiolabeled CBP, SRC-1, and pCIP bound avidly to the amino terminus of TR-β2, but not to the TR-α1 or TR-β1 amino terminus. The coactivators pCAF and p120 did not bind to any of the GST amino-terminal fusion constructs. Fig. 2 B confirms that equivalent amounts of GST proteins were used in the GST interaction assays. These data support the results from the transfection assays, suggesting a functional and structural T3-independent interaction between the TR-β2 amino terminus and certain coactivators. To address the question of whether this interaction is of importance in the context of the full-length receptor, we next performed transfection assays and GST-interaction assays with the full-length receptors. Fig.3 A demonstrated that cotransfection of the full-length receptors with either a CBP or SRC-1 expression vector results in a specific 7–12-fold stimulation by TR-β2 in the absence of T3. Deletion of the amino-terminal amino acids 1–50 (construct TR-β2Δ1–50) resulted in complete loss of the ligand-independent activation of TR-β2. In contrast, CBP or SRC-1 cotransfection yielded a 20-fold T3-dependent stimulation of reporter gene expression regardless of the isoform tested, indicating that all three TR isoforms and the TR-β2 deletion construct showed similar functional interaction with these coactivators and the AF-2 domain in the presence of T3. Specific ligand-independent activation of TR-β2 in the presence of CBP or SRC-1 was also observed on other response elements, Lys and Pal element, respectively (Fig.3 B). Fig. 3 C supports these findings by demonstrating that full-length TR-β2 in the absence of T3bound to CBP, SRC-1, and pCIP 25-, 15-, and 21-fold above background, respectively, as quantified by densitometry. In the presence of T3, there was only a small increase in binding of CBP, SRC-1, and pCIP to TR-β2 (26-fold, 27-fold, and 29-fold, respectively). In contrast, full-length TR-β1 interacted much less well with the same coactivators in the absence of T3 (0.5-, 3.1-, and 6.1-fold, respectively) versus in the presence of T3 (25-fold, 11-fold, and 25-fold, respectively). This structural assay also showed specificity, as p120 and pCAF did not exhibit T3-independent interaction with TR-β2. To isolate the region of the TR-β2 amino terminus that is important for ligand-independent interaction with coactivators, we constructed a number of deletion constructs of the TR-β2 amino terminus (shown in Fig. 4 A) fused downstream and in-frame with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain. Shown in Fig. 4 Bare results with GAL4 fusion constructs tested on the UAS-TK reporter. When cotransfected with CBP or SRC-1, only constructs which contain amino acids 1–50 (N-β2, 1–75, and 1–50) were completely sufficient to mediate reporter gene activation. Constructs containing only amino acids 21 to 50 (21–120 and 21–87) stimulated reporter gene expression about 60–80% of the full-length TR-β2 amino terminus, whereas constructs lacking amino acids 1–50 (51–120 and 89–120) were unable to stimulate reporter gene activity. We next expressed these deletion constructs as GST fusion proteins and then employed them in GST-interaction assays. As shown in Fig.4 C, the fusion proteins containing amino acids 1 to 50 (N-β2, 1–75, and 1–50) were able to bind 35S-labeled CBP, SRC-1, and p-CIP as efficiently as the full-length TR-β2 amino terminus. In contrast, proteins with a deletion of the first 50 amino acids were unable to bind to these coactivators (51–120 and 87–120), and proteins retaining amino acids 21–50 showed significant but reduced coactivator binding. Fig. 4 D demonstrates that equal amounts of GST fusion proteins were used in the GST-interaction assays. Members of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily activate gene transcription by binding to their cognate response elements in the regulatory regions of target genes either as monomers, homodimers, or heterodimers with the retinoid X receptor (RXR). Depending on the target gene and nuclear receptor, transcriptional activity is either activated or repressed in the presence of ligand. Ligand-dependent activation of NRs occurs principally through the AF-2 domain of the ligand-binding domain. In the presence of ligand, amino acid residues in helices 3 and 12 allow for the formation of a groove which binds to the LXXLL motifs of coactivator molecules (38.Daimont B.D. Wagner R.L. Apriletti J.W. Stallcup M.R. Kushner P.J. Baxter J.D. Fletterlick R.J. Yamamoto K.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3343-3350Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). Coactivator molecules include members of the p160 family (SRC-1, TIF II, and ACTR), RIP 140, TRIP100, p300/CBP, and p120 as well as members of the DRIP complex and a number of other proteins (39.Hollenberg An N. Curr. Opin. Endocrin. Diab. 1998; 5: 314-320Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 40.Glass C.K. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 222-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism of action of the coactivator complex has not been fully ascertained, it is believed that transcriptional activation is mediated, at least in part, by histone acetylation by the coactivator complex, which is formed in response to ligand. In addition to the AF-2 domain present in the LBD, NRs also possess an AF-1 domain in their amino-terminal region or A/B domain. The AF-1 function has been shown to be responsive to growth factors in context of the ER and to be a target for phosphorylation by MAP kinase in context of PPARγ (41.Shao D. Rangwala S.M. Bailey S.T. Krakow S.L. Reginato M.J. Lazar M.A. Nature. 1998; 396: 377-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 42.Zhang B. Berger J. Zhou G. Elbrecht A. Biswas S. White-Carrington S. Szalkowski D. Moller D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31771-31774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Indeed, the down-regulation of PPARγ transcriptional activity by MAP kinase is because of a decrease in ligand-binding by PPARγ because of intermolecular communication between the A/B and LBDs. Thus, the activity of an NR cannot be viewed in context of the AF-2 domain alone, as the AF-1 domain may influence AF-2 function either through structural alterations or by independently recruiting other proteins. Both of these functions are supported by recent studies which demonstrate that the androgen receptor (AR) AF-1 and AF-2 domains interact in mammalian cells (43.Ikonen T. Palvimo J.J. Janne O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29821-29828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) and that the ERα AF-1 domain can bind members of the p160 coactivator family while the ERβ AF-1 domain can also bind p160 members when phosphorylated by MAP kinase (44.Tremblay G.B. Tremblay A. Labrie F. Gignere V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1919-1927Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The TR isoforms differ most prominently in their A/B domains, though limited function of these domains has been shown. We and others have demonstrated that the separate TR isoform A/B domains affect DNA binding (35.Hollenberg A., N. Monden T. Wondisford F.E J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14274-14280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 45.Hadzic E. Habeos I. Raaka B.M. Samuels H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10270-10278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In addition, a region of the TR-α1 A/B domain directly recruits members of the basal trancriptional machinery (45.Hadzic E. Habeos I. Raaka B.M. Samuels H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10270-10278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the TR-β2 amino terminus appears to possess a function which differentiates its ligand-independent activity from the other TR isoforms. Indeed, the TR-β2 amino terminus has been shown to be constitutively active when fused to a heterologous DNA-binding domain (18.Sjoberg M. Vennstrom B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4718-4726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and its separate activity on negative TREs maps to another unique region in the A/B domain (19.Langlois M.F. Zanger K. Monden T. Safer J.D.

Unlike the majority of nuclear receptors, TR isoforms possess both ligand-independent and dependent functions which are mediated by their ligand-binding domains. In the absence of ligand, TR-α1 and TR-β1 isoforms repress transcription on positive TREs through the recruitment of nuclear corepressors and resulting histone deacetylase containing complexes (39.Hollenberg An N. Curr. Opin. Endocrin. Diab. 1998; 5: 314-320Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In contrast, the TR-β2 isoform is a poor repressor on positive TREs, indicating that its unique A/B domain may confer a separate activity. This is further supported by the increased ligand-independent activity of the TR-β2 isoform on negative TREs (19.Langlois M.F. Zanger K. Monden T. Safer J.D. Hollenberg A.N. Wondisford F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24927-24933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), suggesting that the A/B domain of this isoform may alter its ability to recruit either coactivators or corepressors. In the present study we have demonstrated that the TR-β2 amino terminus allows for the recruitment of members of the p160 family and CBP through a specific domain located between amino acids 1–50. Indeed, this recruitment can be demonstrated in direct in vitro GST pull-down assays as well as in functional studies in mammalian cells where further activation of this region is seen in the presence of either p160 family members or CBP. This region corresponds to the activation function previously mapped by Sjoberg et al. (18.Sjoberg M. Vennstrom B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4718-4726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and suggests that the constitutive function of this isoform may be related to its ability to interact with coactivators in the absence of ligand. Importantly, specificity is also demonstrated in that pCAF, which is known to interact with the DNA-binding domain of the NRs (22.Blanco J.C. Minucci S. Lu J. Yang X.J. Walker K.K. Chen H. Evans R.M. Nakatani Y. Ozato K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1638-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), is unable to enhance the activation function of the TR-β2 amino terminus. As well, p120, another NR coactivator, is unable to augment the function of, or bind to, the TR-β2 amino terminus. To ensure that the interaction of p160 family members and CBP with the TR-β2 amino terminus is not artifactual, we have also demonstrated, using in vitro GST pull-down assays, that the entire TR-β2 isoform selectively binds to these coactivators in the absence of ligand. Furthermore, these binding studies are in agreement with the functional effects of these coactivators on the entire TR-β2 isoform in transfection studies. These data suggest that the recruitment of coactivators by the TR-β2 amino terminus impairs ligand-independent repression by this isoform by either preventing the recruitment of corepressors or more likely by altering the ratio histone acetylation/deacetylation, which ultimately determines the degree of transcriptional activation. In this model, the TR-β2 isoform would recruit both corepressors (through the LBD) and coactivators (through the amino terminus) which would prevent silencing. Tissue-specific expression of coregulators in the pituitary or hypothalamus, where TR-β2 action is paramount, would ultimately affect the ligand-independent activity of this isoform. Further studies in hypothalamic TRH neurons and pituitary thyrotrophs will determine the cofactor profile in these cells."

Tapasin is a subunit of the TAP complex and binds both to TAP1 and MHC class I. In the absence of tapasin, the assembly of MHC class I in the ER is impaired, and the surface expression is reduced. To clarify the function of tapasin in the processing of antigenic peptides, we studied the interaction of peptide and TAP, peptide transport across the membrane of the ER, and association of peptides with MHC class I molecules in the microsomes derived from tapasin mutant cell line 721.220, its sister cell line 721.221 expressing tapasin, and their HLA-A2 transfectants. The binding of peptides to TAP in tapasin mutant 721.220 cells was significantly diminished in comparison with 721.221 cells. Impaired peptide-TAP interaction resulted in a defective peptide transport in tapasin mutant 721.220 cells. Interestingly, despite the diminished peptide binding to TAP, the transport rate of TAP-associated peptides was not significantly altered in 721.220 cells. After transfection of tapasin cDNA into 721.220 cells, efficient peptide-TAP interaction was restored. Thus, we conclude that tapasin is required for efficient peptide-TAP interaction.

Immunoprecipitation with anti-TAP1 antiserum demonstrated that TAP associates with MHC class I heavy chain-β2-microglobulin dimer (10.Ortmann B. Androlewicz M.J. Cresswell P.

Science. 1994; 264: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The importance of the TAP-MHC class I interaction for the assembly of MHC class I and peptides was suggested by the finding in which deficiency in MHC class I surface expression was found in a cell line, 721.220, lacking interaction of MHC class I and TAP (12.Grandea III, A.G. Androlewicz M.J. Athwal R.S. Geraghty D.E. Spies T. Science. 1995; 270: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). With anti-TAP1 antiserum, a 48-kDa protein (tapasin) was coprecipitated, and this protein was missing in 721.220 cells, indicative of requirement of tapasin in the interaction of MHC class I and TAP (13.Sadasivan B.

Immunoprecipitation with anti-TAP1 or anti-tapasin antisera demonstrated a consistent and stoichiometric association of tapasin and TAP1 and TAP2 (14.Li S. Sjogren H.O. Hellman U. Pettersson R.F. Wang P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8708-8713Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The importance of tapasin in MHC class I antigen presentation was demonstrated by restored MHC class I surface expression and class I-TAP interaction in 721.220 cells after transfection with tapasin cDNA (15.Ortmann B. Copeman J. Lehner P.J. Sadasivan B. Herberg J.A. Grandea A.G. Riddell S.R. Tampa R. Spies T. Trowsdale J. Cresswell P. Science. 1997; 277: 1306-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar), suggesting that either tapasin directly regulates the assembly of MHC class I and peptide or the association of MHC class I with TAP enhances peptide loading. The importance of MHC class I-TAP interaction in peptide loading was opposed by recent findings, in which the ER luminal domain of tapasin (soluble tapasin) was expressed in 721.220 cells. Soluble tapasin associated with class I but did not interact with TAP (16.Lehner P.J. Surman M.J. Cresswell P. Immunity. 1998; 8: 221-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). In the absence of interaction with TAP, soluble tapasin restored surface expression of MHC class I and the presentation of viral peptides to CTL (16.Lehner P.J. Surman M.J. Cresswell P. Immunity. 1998; 8: 221-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The conclusion from this study was that tapasin-MHC class I interaction, but not tapasin-TAP interaction, was required for peptide loading (16.Lehner P.J. Surman M.J. Cresswell P. Immunity. 1998; 8: 221-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). However, there are conflicting reports concerning the importance of the tapasin-MHC class I interaction in promoting peptide loading. It has been reported that HLA-B27 and HLA-A2 could assemble with peptide in tapasin mutant cells, although HLA-B27 and HLA-A2 could interact with tapasin in wild type cells (17.Peh C.A. Burrows S.R. Barnden M. Khanna R. Cresswell P. Moss D.J. McCluskey J. Immunity. 1998; 8: 531-542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 18.Lewis J.W. Elliott T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 717-720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, a murine mutant MHC class I Dd (E222K) was discovered having a Glu to Lys mutation at residue 222 of the heavy chain. This mutation caused deficiency in interaction with tapasin (19.Suh W.K. Derby M.A. Cohen-Doyle M.F. Schoenhals G.J. Fråh K. Berzofsky J.A. Williams D.B. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 1530-1540PubMed Google Scholar). Significant peptide loading onto Dd (E222K) was observed (19.Suh W.K. Derby M.A. Cohen-Doyle M.F. Schoenhals G.J. Fråh K. Berzofsky J.A. Williams D.B. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 1530-1540PubMed Google Scholar). These results indicate that the interaction of tapasin and MHC class I is not essential for peptide loading. In this study, we used reporter peptides in which the ε-amino group of lysine was covalently modified by coupling a chemical cross-linker (ANB-NOS), and the tyrosine was labeled by iodination (125I). These modifications allowed photocross-linking of the reporter peptides to TAP and MHC class I and enabled us to monitor the peptide binding to TAP, peptide translocation, and assembly of peptide and MHC class I in purified microsomes derived from tapasin mutant cells, 721.220, and its sister cells, 721.221, as well as their HLA-A2 transfectants. Our results clearly indicate that tapasin is required for efficient peptide-TAP interaction. 721.220 and 721.221 cell lines and 721.220-HLA-A2 and 721.221-HLA-A2 cell lines were kindly provided by Drs. J. C. Solheim and T. Elliott, respectively. The 721.174 cell line was a gift from Dr. S. Kvist The cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine at 37 °C in a 5% CO2atmosphere. The cDNA encoding wild type human tapasin was constructed into pCEP4 expression vector (CLONTECH). The constructs were transfected into 721.220 cells by electroporation. Transfected cells were selected in hygromycin-containing medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) and then cloned by limiting dilution. Expression of transfected tapasin was measured by immunoblotting with anti-human tapasin antiserum. The monoclonal antibody BB7.2, specific for HLA-A2, and rabbit antiserum to human MHC class I (R425) were kindly provided by Dr. S. Kvist. Rabbit antisera against human TAP1 and tapasin were described previously (9.Wang P. Raynoschek C. Svensson K. Ljunggren H.G. J. Biol.

Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in methionine-free RPMI 1640 medium containing 3% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. Then 0.2 mCi/ml [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added, and the incubation was continued for 60 min. At the end of labeling, cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 1% digitonin (Sigma) or 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer containing 0.15 m NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1.5 mg/ml iodoacetamide, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, 30 mg/ml aprotinin, 10 mg/ml pepstatin). The cleared lysates were added to antibodies previously bound to protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). After washing, the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Western blotting and FACS analysis were performed as described previously (9.Wang P. Raynoschek C. Svensson K. Ljunggren H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24830-24835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). All peptides were synthesized in a peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, model 431A), using conventional Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry. Peptides were subsequently purified by high pressure liquid chromatography and dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline. The ε-amino group of lysine in peptides of influenza-A virus nucleoprotein, NP383–391R389K (SRYWAIKTR); influenza-A matrix protein (MP), M58–64G58YF62K (YILGKVFTL); and OVA 257–264I259Y (SIYNFEKL) were covalently modified by a photoreactive cross-linker as described previously (7.Wang P., G. Gyllner Kvist S. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 213-220PubMed Google Scholar). An aliquot (1 μg) of the peptide was labeled by chloramine T-catalyzed iodination (125I). The modification and labeling experiments were performed in the dark. The cross-linker modified and 125I-labeled peptides are referred to as125I-OVA-ANB-NOS or 125I-MP-ANB-NOS or125I-nucleoprotein-ANB-NOS. Microsomes from cell lines were prepared and purified according to Sarasteet al. (20.Saraste J. Palade G.E. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6425-6429Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). For photocross-linking,125I-labeled and ANB-NOS-modified peptide was mixed with 20 μl of microsomes (concentration of 60 A 280/ml) to a final concentration of 100 nm, in RM buffer (250 mm sucrose, 50 mm triethanolamine-HCl, 50 mm KOAc, 2 mm MgOAc2, 1 mm dithiothreitol). This mixture was then kept at 26 °C for 5 min UV irradiation was subsequently carried out for 5 min on ice at 366 nm. Microsomal membranes were recovered by centrifugation through a 0.5 m sucrose cushion in RM buffer containing 1 mm cold peptide (unlabeled peptide without ANB-NOS modification). The microsomal membranes were washed once with cold RM buffer, lysed by 1% digitonin or 1% Nonidet P-40, and subjected to immunoprecipitation. Cross-linked microsomal proteins were immunoprecipitated with specific antiserum. The precipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE or quantitated by a γ-counter. Cross-linking reactions with transport buffer containing 1 mm ATP were performed as described previously (7.Wang P., G. Gyllner Kvist S. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 213-220PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Li S. Sjogren H.O. Hellman U. Pettersson R.F. Wang P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8708-8713Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). For peptide competition, 100 nm of the 125I-labeled and ANB-NOS-modified peptide was mixed with a 10-fold molar excess or with the concentrations indicated in Fig. 3 of unlabeled and unmodified peptide before the cross-linking reaction. It was previously reported that the peptide transport across the ER membrane is a stepwise process including an ATP-independent interaction of peptide and TAP and a subsequent ATP-dependent translocation of peptide (6.Androlewicz M.J. Cresswell P. Immunity. 1994; 1: 7-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 9.Wang P. Raynoschek C. Svensson K. Ljunggren H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24830-24835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). To investigate the involvement of tapasin in TAP function, three reporter peptides (see “Materials and Methods”) were modified with cross-linker and labeled with 125I as described previously (7.Wang P., G. Gyllner Kvist S. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 213-220PubMed Google Scholar) and incubated with microsomes derived from the tapasin mutant cell 721.220, its sister cell line 721.221 with wild type tapasin, and a TAP mutant cell line 721.174 in the absence of ATP. After incubation, the microsomes were irradiated by UV to induce cross-linking. The peptide-bound TAP molecules were precipitated by anti-TAP1 antiserum. Analysis of precipitates revealed efficient binding of all three reporter peptides to TAP in microsomes from 721.221 (Fig.1 A, lanes 2, 4, and 6). Significantly diminished peptide-TAP interaction was observed in tapasin mutant microsomes (Fig.1 A, lanes 3, 5, and7). The expression level of TAP1 and TAP2 in 721.221 and 721.220 was very similar, as indicated by immunoprecipitation with anti-TAP1 antiserum (Fig. 1 B, lanes 2–3). TAP mutant 721.174 served as a negative control in both cross-linking and immunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. 1,lane 1, in A and B). A similar experiment performed with microsomes of tapasin-transfected 721.220 cells demonstrated restoration of an efficient peptide binding to TAP (Fig. 2). These results indicate that tapasin is required for an efficient peptide-TAP interaction.Figure 2Restoration of efficient peptide-binding capacity to TAP in 721.220 tapasin transfectant.Cross-linker-modified OVA peptide was labeled with 125I and incubated with microsomal membranes from 721.220 (A,lane 1) or 721.220 tapasin transfectant (A, lane 2). After cross-linking, the cleared lysates were precipitated with an anti-TAP1 antiserum. The precipitates were analyzed on SDS-PAGE. The expression of transfected tapasin in 721.220 tapasin transfectant was detected by Western blotting with anti-tapasin antiserum (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To assess the binding affinity of peptide to TAP in 721.221 or 721.220 cells, 100 nm of cross-linker-modified reporter peptide, 125I-OVA-ANB-NOS, was incubated with 721.221 or 721.220 microsomes in the presence of native and unlabeled OVA peptide at different concentrations. In order to dissect the peptide binding from the peptide translocation, the assay was done in the absence of ATP as previously reported (9.Wang P. Raynoschek C. Svensson K. Ljunggren H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24830-24835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Again a significant deficiency of peptide-TAP interaction was detected in 721.220 microsomes in the absence of competing peptide (Fig. 3,lane 1). The peptide binding to TAP in 721.220 microsomes was completely competed by a lower concentration (400 nm) of native peptide (Fig. 3), whereas in 721.221 microsomes, more than 1.6 μm concentration was required for completely competing away reporter peptide binding (Fig. 3). These data indicate that the affinity for peptide binding to TAP in tapasin mutant cells is much lower than in wild type cells. After having demonstrated a lower peptide binding to TAP in tapasin mutant cells, we examined the transport efficiency by measuring the time for translocation of 50% TAP-bound peptides into the microsomes of wild type, 721.221A2, or tapasin mutant cells, 721.220A2, in the presence of ATP. After incubation of 125I-MP-ANB-NOS peptide with microsomes from 721.220A2 or 721.221A2 cells, the excess125I-MP-ANB-NOS peptides were washed off. Peptide-loaded microsomes were then resuspended in transport buffer with 100 μm ATP and incubated for different periods of time. After incubation, the microsomes were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and subsequently precipitated with anti-TAP1 or anti-HLA-A2 antibodies. The peptide-bound TAP or HLA-A2 molecules were quantitated by a γ-counter. In the presence of ATP, peptide rapidly dissociated from TAP in both 721.220A2 and 721.221A2 microsomes, despite the fact that the amount of peptide-bound TAP1 in 721.220A2 cells was lower (Fig.4, upper panel). Fifty percent dissociation of peptides from TAP was detected at an early time point in both 721.220A2 and 721.221A2 microsomes (Fig. 4,upper panel). Moreover, 50% of translocated peptides were recovered by anti-HLA-A2 antibody at the same time point in both 721.220A2 and 721.221A2 microsomes, although a much lower amount of peptide-bound A2 was obtained in 721.220A2 microsomes (Fig.4, lower panel). These results indicated that mutation of tapasin greatly affected peptide interaction with TAP but affected the peptide translocation much less or not at all. As shown above, the peptide-TAP interaction is deficient in tapasin mutant cells. To further investigate MHC class I assembly in the absence of tapasin, intact microsomes of 721.221A2 and 721.220A2 cells were mixed with 125I-MP-ANB-NOS peptide, which binds to HLA-A2, in the presence of ATP. The peptide translocation was monitored by 125I-MP-ANB-NOS peptide cross-linked HLA-A2. After cross-linking, microsomes were lysed with 1% digitonin. The cleared lysates were aliquoted and precipitated with anti-TAP1 and anti-HLA-A2, respectively. Consistent with the results shown in Fig. 1, anti-TAP1 recovered peptide-bound TAP and HLA-A2 in 721.221A2 microsomes (Fig. 5,lane 3), but only a weak peptide cross-linked TAP band was detected in 721.220A2 microsomes (Fig. 5, lane 2). With anti-HLA-A2 antibody, less peptide-cross-linked HLA-A2 was recovered in 721.220A2 microsomes (Fig. 5, lane 6) in comparison with 721.221A2 microsomes (Fig. 5,lane 4). In addition, a weak peptide-cross-linked tapasin was also detected (Fig. 5, lane 4), which corresponds to our previous findings (14.Li S. Sjogren H.O. Hellman U. Pettersson R.F. Wang P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8708-8713Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 21.Li S. Paulsson K.M. Sjogren H.O. Wang P. J. Biol.

The less peptide-cross-linked HLA-A2 in 721.220A2 microsomes (Fig. 5,lane 6) was correlated with reduced HLA-A2 surface expression (Fig. 6). However, in 721.220A2 microsomes, anti-HLA-A2 could still precipitate a significant amount of peptide-bound A2 (Fig. 5, lane 6), which was compatible with the amount of peptides bound to TAP (Fig. 5,lane 2) and with the amount of HLA-A2 expressed on the cell surface (Fig. 6).Figure 6Reduced surface expression of HLA-A2 in 721.220A2 cells. The cells of 721.220A2 or 721.221A2 were incubated with BB7.2 antibody and subsequently with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ig antibody. After washing, the BB7.2-labeled cells were analyzed by flow cytometry on a FACScan.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) These results suggest that the reduced surface expression and translocated peptides in the ER of 721.220A2 cells result from deficient peptide-TAP interaction. Moreover, despite the deficiency of peptide-TAP interaction in 721.220A2 cells, TAP still can transport peptides in the presence of ATP, which is compatible with previous findings (12.Grandea III, A.G. Androlewicz M.J. Athwal R.S. Geraghty D.E. Spies T. Science. 1995; 270: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Previously, it was reported that the assembly of peptide and MHC class I in tapasin mutant cells was defective (8.Pamer E. Cresswell P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 323-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that murine tapasin associated with peptide-bound H-2Kb (21.Li S. Paulsson K.M. Sjogren H.O. Wang P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8649-8654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To further confirm the interaction of peptide-bound MHC class I with human tapasin, purified microsomes from 721.220A2 and 721.221A2 were incubated with 125I-MP-ANB-NOS peptide in the presence of ATP. Anti-tapasin antiserum precipitated peptide-bound HLA-A2 and TAP in 721.221A2 but not in 721.220A2 microsomes (Fig.7, lanes 1 and2). This result clearly indicates that tapasin does not exclusively bind to peptide free MHC class I. The function of TAP to mediate peptide transport into the ER is well established (2.Germain R.N.

The importance of a direct interaction between peptide and TAP for peptide translocation was clearly demonstrated by the findings in which the herpes simplex virus ICP47 protein inhibits the MHC class I antigen presentation pathway by occupying the peptide binding site on TAP (22.Fruh K.

Tapasin is a type I ER membrane protein and bridges the association of MHC class I with TAP (13.Sadasivan B. Lehner P.J. Ortmann B. Spies T. Cresswell P.

Geraghty D.E. Spies T. Science. 1995; 270: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), and this defect can be corrected by transfection of wild type tapasin cDNA (13.Sadasivan B. Lehner P.J. Ortmann B. Spies T. Cresswell P. Immunity. 1996; 5: 103-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). Tapasin was suggested to function by promoting the peptide loading onto MHC class I (8.Pamer E. Cresswell P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 323-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar). In the present study, we systematically examined the peptide interaction with TAP, the peptide translocation into the ER, and the peptide assembly with MHC class I in microsomes purified from tapasin mutant cells and wild type cells as well. A severe defect in peptide-TAP interaction was revealed in the tapasin mutated cell 721.220. In contrast, the peptide translocation across the membrane of the ER was intact, as indicated by the same off rate of TAP-associated peptides in tapasin mutated and wild type microsomes in the presence of ATP. The translocated HLA-A2-binding peptide could bind to HLA-A2 molecules in both tapasin mutated and wild type microsomes, although the amount of peptide-associated HLA-A2 in 721.220-A2 cells was much less than that in its sister cell line 721.221-A2 expressing wild type tapasin. This reduction was due to the deficient interaction between peptide and TAP. Tapasin is a subunit of the TAP complex as indicated by the consistent and stoichiometric association of tapasin with TAP1 and TAP2 (14.Li S. Sjogren H.O. Hellman U. Pettersson R.F. Wang P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8708-8713Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Previously, it was reported that peptide transport in tapasin mutant cells was not altered (12.Grandea III, A.G. Androlewicz M.J. Athwal R.S. Geraghty D.E. Spies T. Science. 1995; 270: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In that study, translocation of peptides in 721.220 and wild type cells was analyzed by recovery of a glycosylated reporter peptide in streptolysin O-permeabilized cells. Since TAP-dependent peptide translocation was intact in tapasin mutant cells, it was conceivable that accumulation of translocated peptides in the ER might result from the decay kinetics of transported peptides in tapasin mutant cells. Restored peptide-TAP binding and peptide translocation in tapasin-transfected 721.220 cells clearly demonstrated that tapasin is required for efficient peptide binding to TAP. In agreement with our results from tapasin-transfected 721.220, a study of 721.220B8 tapasin transfectant also revealed a more than 4-fold increase in peptide translocation after expressing tapasin in 721.220B8 cells (16.Lehner P.J. Surman M.J. Cresswell P. Immunity. 1998; 8: 221-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). In addition, it has recently been reported that the C-terminal region of tapasin was identified as a binding site of TAP (25.Bangia N. Lehner P.J. Hughes E.A. Surman M. Cresswell P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29 (1807): 1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Transfection of the C-terminal region of tapasin enhanced the function of TAP in tapasin mutant cells (25.Bangia N. Lehner P.J. Hughes E.A. Surman M. Cresswell P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29 (1807): 1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In previous studies (14.Li S. Sjogren H.O. Hellman U. Pettersson R.F. Wang P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8708-8713Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 21.Li S. Paulsson K.M. Sjogren H.O. Wang P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8649-8654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) as well as the present studies (Fig. 5,lane 4), we found a weak interaction of peptides and tapasin in the presence of ATP but not in the absence of ATP. Since the peptide-TAP interaction is independent of ATP, it is not likely that tapasin is involved in the peptide binding site on the TAP complex. Both TAP1 and TAP2 are required for efficient peptide binding, certain peptides binding preferentially to TAP1 and others to TAP2 (10.Ortmann B. Androlewicz M.J. Cresswell P. Nature. 1994; 368: 864-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Although peptide binding to human TAP is relatively promiscuous, the difference of binding affinity of various peptides can be as great as 3 orders of magnitude, depending on both the terminal and the internal sequence of the peptides (7.Wang P., G. Gyllner Kvist S. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 213-220PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Androlewicz M.J., B. Ortmann P.M. van Endert T. Spies Cresswell P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 716-720Crossref Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Among three peptides tested in this study, similar deficiency in their ability to bind to TAP of 721.220 cells suggested that the requirement of tapasin for peptide-TAP interaction is not based on the sequence of the peptides. Searching for peptide-binding sites, the regions of the TAP subunits to which the photoactive peptides bind were mapped by proteolysis of the TAP proteins after photocross-linking and immunoprecipitation with antisera specific for distinct hydrophilic regions (27.Nijenhuis M. Schmitt S. Armandola E.A. Obst R. Brunner J. Hämmerling G.J. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 2186-2195PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Nijenhuis M. Hämmerling G.J. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 5467-5477PubMed Google Scholar). The results suggest that the binding site is composed of multiple regions of TAP1 and TAP2. Interaction of the same photoreactive peptide to multiple regions of TAP1 and TAP2 may indicate a large binding pocket (27.Nijenhuis M. Schmitt S. Armandola E.A. Obst R. Brunner J. Hämmerling G.J. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 2186-2195PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Nijenhuis M. Hämmerling G.J. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 5467-5477PubMed Google Scholar). This study also suggested that the binding regions are very close to or part of the transmembrane domains. The interaction of tapasin with TAP may largely regulate the peptide binding site. Recently, the ER luminal domain of tapasin was expressed as a soluble form of tapasin in 721.220 cells (16.Lehner P.J. Surman M.J. Cresswell P. Immunity. 1998; 8: 221-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Soluble tapasin bound to MHC class I, but not to TAP. The peptide transport was measured in 721.220, 721.220 transfected with soluble tapasin, and 721.220 with wild type tapasin. Results showed that wild type tapasin increased the efficient peptide translocation in 721.220 cells, but soluble tapasin transfectants retained their deficient peptide transport (16.Lehner P.J. Surman M.J. Cresswell P. Immunity. 1998; 8: 221-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results and our own indicate that the interaction of tapasin and TAP is critical for efficient peptide transport. Tapasin may function to stabilize the peptide-binding site of TAP. Since tapasin directly interacts with MHC class I heavy chain and β2-microglobulin dimer, it was suggested that this interaction enhances peptide loading onto class I molecules, possibly due to a high local concentration of peptides or to the requirement of tapasin itself for peptide-MHC class I assembly. Support for the importance of MHC class I-TAP interaction was evidenced by the finding of a deficient TAP-dependent peptide assembly of a mutant HLA-A2.1 (29.Peace-Brewer A.L. Tussey L.J. Matsui M. Li G. Quinn D.G. Frelinger J.A. Immunity. 1996; 4: 505-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 30.Lewis J.W. Neisig A. Neefjes J. Elliott T. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 873-883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). A point mutation of theronine 134 to lysine resulted in HLA-A2.1 incapable of interacting with TAP (29.Peace-Brewer A.L. Tussey L.J. Matsui M. Li G. Quinn D.G. Frelinger J.A. Immunity. 1996; 4: 505-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 30.Lewis J.W. Neisig A. Neefjes J. Elliott T. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 873-883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Moreover, the deficient assembly of HLA-A2.1 (T134K) was corrected by a direct delivery of peptide to the ER in a TAP-independent manner. Therefore, it was concluded that the interaction of TAP and MHC class I is essential for peptide loading. Recently, this notion has been called into question by the finding that a soluble tapasin restored the surface expression of HLA-B8 in 721.220B8 cells, despite the lack of interaction between MHC class I and TAP (16.Lehner P.J. Surman M.J. Cresswell P. Immunity. 1998; 8: 221-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Notably, soluble tapasin-MHC class I interaction was unstable in detergent lysates and required chemical cross-linking for their detection. Since soluble tapasin lacks the motif of the ER retrieval signal present in the wild type tapasin, the increased surface expression can be explained as a lack of control of MHC class I retention in the ER. Tapasin may regulate the MHC class I release from the ER rather than directly load peptides on MHC class I. Recently, it was found that HLA-B27 and HLA-A2 presented peptides to cytotoxic T cells in tapasin mutant 721.220B27 or 721.220A2 cells (17.Peh C.A. Burrows S.R. Barnden M. Khanna R. Cresswell P. Moss D.J. McCluskey J. Immunity. 1998; 8: 531-542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 31.Lewis J.W. Sewell A. Price D. Elliott T. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 3214-3240Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), although both alleles were found to associate with tapasin in wild type cells. Furthermore, a mutant H2-Dd with a Glu to Lys mutation at residue 222 (Dd E222K) was shown not to be substantially impaired in its ability to present peptides (18.Lewis J.W. Elliott T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 717-720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) despite its loss of ability for interaction with tapasin. Although there is a lack of direct evidence for the involvement of tapasin in peptide loading onto MHC class I, a recent study of the HLA-A2 T134K mutant indicates that the interaction of MHC class I with the TAP complex may be important for the optimization of MHC class I assembly (32.Marguet D. Spiliotis E.T. Pentcheva T. Lebowitz M. Schneck J. Edidin M. Immunity. 1999; 11: 231-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The T134K mutant did not bind to tapasin or calreticulin, and it failed to present endogenous viral peptides to T cells (32.Marguet D. Spiliotis E.T. Pentcheva T. Lebowitz M. Schneck J. Edidin M. Immunity. 1999; 11: 231-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). However, the mutant class I had the ability to bind peptides in vitro (32.Marguet D. Spiliotis E.T. Pentcheva T. Lebowitz M. Schneck J. Edidin M. Immunity. 1999; 11: 231-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was suggested that the TAP complex is involved in a quality control stage during MHC class I assembly. This view is supported by the study of green fluorescence protein-tagged MHC class I (33), which shows that peptide-loaded MHC class I can also be retained in the ER for optimizing peptide loading. In the presented study, most of the peptide-loaded HLA-A2 was found to be associated with tapasin in 721.221A2, which is in line with our previous finding of an association of peptide-loaded mouse MHC class I with tapasin (21.Li S. Paulsson K.M. Sjogren H.O. Wang P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8649-8654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and indicates that tapasin may also regulate the transport of assembled MHC class I to the cell surface.

This m-tyramine-induced increase in reactivity appeared to require the inward transport rather than the outward transport or external binding of m-tyramine, and it was prevented by cocaine. Thus, inward translocation of substrates may involve structural rearrangement of hDAT, which likely exposes Cys-342 to reaction with MTSEA, and Cys-342 may be located on a part of the transporter associated with cytoplasmic gating.

These studies together suggest that cysteine residues in DAT may play a role in both substrate transport and inhibitor binding. The cloning of DAT (15.Shimada S. Kitayama S. Lin C.L. Patel A.

Brain Res. 1992; 15: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) has provided an opportunity to identify the specific cysteines implicated in substrate transport by and inhibitor binding to DAT. The proposed topology for DAT places eight cysteines in putative hydrophilic loops on the external and cytoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane and in the cytoplasmic N and C termini: four cysteines are extracellular (Cys-90, Cys-180, Cys-189, and Cys-306), and four cysteines are intracellular (Cys-6, Cys-135, Cys-342, and Cys-581). Five of the putative loop cysteines are completely conserved among monoamine transporters (Cys-90, Cys-135, Cys-180, Cys-189, and Cys-342), whereas Cys-306 is unique to DAT. Cys-180 and Cys-189 are required for the appropriate processing and membrane insertion of DAT and have been proposed to form a disulfide bond (20.Wang J.B. Moriwaki A. Uhl G.R. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 1416-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A similar proposal has been made for the aligned cysteines in the homologous serotonin transporter (21.Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1479-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Recently, a human DAT (hDAT) construct, X5C, has been created, in which four cysteines in loops (Cys-90, Cys-135, Cys-306, and Cys-342) have been replaced by alanine, and one cysteine in the sixth transmembrane domain (Cys-319), has been replaced by phenylalanine (22.Ferrer J.V. Javitch J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9238-9243Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). [3H]CFT binding to X5C was significantly less sensitive to inhibition by polar sulfhydryl-specific derivatives of methanethiosulfonate (MTS). The accessibility of the four wild-type loop cysteines, when substituted back one at a time into X5C, to MTS reagents was compatible with the originally proposed topology (18.Giros B. El Mestikawy S. Godinot N. Zheng K. Han H. Yang-Feng T. Caron M.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 42: 383-390PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Vandenbergh D.J. Persico A.M. Uhl G.R. Mol. Brain Res. 1992; 15: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Reaction of Cys-90 and Cys-306 with MTS reagents potentiated [3H]CFT binding, whereas reaction of Cys-135 and Cys-342 inhibited binding. Moreover, cocaine increased the accessibility of Cys-90 but protected Cys-135 and Cys-342 (22.Ferrer J.V. Javitch J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9238-9243Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have further characterized the roles of the loop cysteines, Cys-90, Cys-135, Cys-306, and Cys-342, in DA transport. We used rotating disc electrode voltammetry to measure the initial rates of DA transport by the constructs into which the wild-type cysteines were substituted back into X5C and compared their transport properties with those of X5C and wild-type hDAT (WT). We further investigated the effects of MTS reagents on DA uptake as well as the abilities of the substrate m-tyramine and the inhibitor cocaine to alter the rates of reaction of the MTS reagents. We report that Cys-342 may be important for maintaining the transport properties of WT. Furthermore, the reaction of Cys-342 with (2-aminoethyl)methanethiosulfonate (MTSEA) is faster in the presence of substrate and is blocked by cocaine. Thus, Cys-342 or the loop in which this residue is located may participate in the conformational rearrangements associated with substrate translocation. Cysteine mutations and HEK 293 cells stably expressing wild-type and mutant hDAT were generated as described previously (22.Ferrer J.V. Javitch J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9238-9243Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The cells expressing wild-type hDAT or X5C are referred to as WT or X5C. The cells expressing the mutants into which a wild-type cysteine was substituted back into X5C are referred to as X-A90C, X-A135C, X-A306C, X-F319C, or X-A342C. Stably transfected cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum (HyClone) and 2 mm l-glutamine at 37 °C and 5% CO2. When cells had grown to confluence, they were harvested by dissociation and centrifugation. The total cell protein was determined using a Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit. For each mutant the IC50 of CFT was determined from the competition of [3H]CFT (14 nm) (84.5 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) by 10 different concentrations (1 nm to 1 μm) of unlabeled CFT (Research Biochemicals Inc., Natick, MA). In duplicate tubes we combined 5 μl of CFT with 20 μl of cell suspension diluted in binding buffer (130 mm NaCl, 1.3 mm KCl, 2.2 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mmKH2PO4, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4) and 25 μl [3H]CFT in a final volume of 50 μl. The mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 2 h and then filtered with a Brandel cell harvester through Whatman 934AH glass fiber filters (Bethesda, MD) soaked in 0.2% polyethyleneimine. The filter was washed three times with 1 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl and 120 mm NaCl (pH 7.4) at 4 °C. Specific [3H]CFT binding was defined as total binding less nonspecific binding in the presence of 100 μm cocaine. The IC50 values for CFT were determined by fitting the data for CFT competition to the equation for a sigmoidal dose response curve allowing for a variable Hill Slope (Prism, GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Measurement of uptake with rotating disc electrode voltammetry was performed as described previously (23.Chen N Trowbridge C.G. Justice Jr., J.B. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 653-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 24.Chen N. Justice Jr., J.B. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 10257-10268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were resuspended in Krebs/Ringer/HEPES buffer (KRH), which contained 150 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 2.2 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 10 mmHEPES, and 10 mm glucose (pH 7.4). In some cases, Na+ was fully substituted with isosmolar quantities of Li+ in chloride salt form. A Teflon-shielded glassy carbon working electrode (AFMD03GC, 3 mm, Pine Instrument Company, Grove City, PA) was placed slightly below the surface of the cell suspension and rotated with an AFMSRX Analytical Rotator System (Pine Instrument Company) at 4000 rpm. A dual channel microelectrode potentiostat (EI-400, Ensman Instrumentation, Bloomington, IN), with an Ag/AgCl reference electrode and a platinum auxiliary electrode, was used to control the potentials: 350 mV for DA and 650 mV form-tyramine. All data acquisition and processing were performed using Origin (MicroCal Software, Inc., Northampton, MA) linked via a DT-2801 interface board (Data Translation, Marlboro, MA). All transport experiments were performed at 37 °C unless noted. Initial uptake rates were obtained from linear regression analysis of the decrease in medium substrate concentration versus time over the first 10–15 s after an addition of a substrate (23.Chen N Trowbridge C.G. Justice Jr., J.B. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 653-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 24.Chen N. Justice Jr., J.B. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 10257-10268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Burnette W.B. Bailey M.D. Kukoyi S. Blakely R.D. Trowbridge C.G. Justice Jr., J.B. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 2932-2938Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). 100 μm cocaine was used to define the nonspecific uptake. For saturation analysis of DA uptake, initial rates of DA uptake were measured at five to eight different DA concentrations bracketing theK m value of a particular hDAT mutant. Inhibition by cocaine or by m-tyramine of DA uptake was determined at various DA concentrations and a fixed concentration of cocaine (0.5 μm for both WT and mutants) or m-tyramine (0.5 μm for X5C, X-A90C, and X-A306C, 1 μm for X-A135C, 2 μm for X-A342C, and 5 μm for WT). Eadie-Hofstee transformation of the Michaelis-Menten equation was used to calculate the maximal rate of transport (V max) and the half-saturation concentration of DA (K m). Because both cocaine andm-tyramine appeared to be competitive inhibitors of DA transport, the half-saturation inhibition constant (K i) was estimated using the equationK mobs = K m (1 + [compound]/K i), whereK mobs and K m are the half-saturation concentrations of DA in the absence and presence of a tested compound. MTS reagents (Toronto Research Chemicals Inc., Toronto, Canada) were dissolved in water as 40× stocks and placed on ice prior to use. Intact cells (about one-fifth of a confluent 150-mm plate) were resuspended in 200 μl of KRH, and the MTS reagents were added to their final concentrations. Unless otherwise stated, incubations with MTS reagents were done at room temperature (21 °C) for 2 min, and for protection experiments, cocaine orm-tyramine was added 10 min prior to the MTS reagents and remained to the end of the MTS reaction. Reactions were terminated by a 10-fold dilution with KRH, and cells were then washed twice with KRH. If cells were treated with MTSEA in Na+-free, Li+-substituted KRH, they were washed with the Na+-free, Li+-substituted KRH first and then with normal KRH. After washing, cells were resuspended in 300 μl of 37 °C KRH for transport assays. The effect of the MTS reagents on uptake is expressed as the percentage of control (100 × uptake after MTS treatment/uptake before MTS treatment). Second order rate constants (k) were calculated by plotting fractional uptake (F) as a function of time (t) and then fitting the data to the equationF = (1 − F plateau) × exp(−kct) + F plateau, in whichc is the concentration of MTS reagent used,F plateau is the fractional uptake at very larget and is constrained to be ≥0, and k is the second order rate constant (m−1s−1). The expression level for hDAT measured by [3H]CFT binding varied with the individual mutants. X-A135C and X-A342C expressed at levels similar to WT, and the other mutants expressed at levels approximately 15–30% of WT. All of the mutants bound [3H]CFT with an affinity comparable with that of WT (Table I). The Hill slope for unlabeled CFT to inhibit [3H]CFT binding was less than unity in most cases (Table I).Table I[ 3 H]CFT binding to and DA uptake into intact HEK 293 cells stably expressing wild-type or indicated mutant hDATMutant hDAT[3H]CFT bindingDA uptakeaHill slopes of DA uptake by all cell lines were close to unity.BoundIC50Hill SlopeV maxK mpmol/mgnmpmol/s/mgnmWT hDAT2.87 ± 0.7553 ± 6−0.77 ± 0.0561.2 ± 1.92186 ± 94X5C0.42 ± 0.0440 ± 16−0.72 ± 0.061.66 ± 0.13240 ± 15X-A90C0.49 ± 0.0971 ± 27−0.52 ± 0.051.58 ± 0.10220 ± 11X-A135C3.25 ± 0.4145 ± 7−0.81 ± 0.068.40 ± 0.27448 ± 36X-A306C0.86 ± 0.3243 ± 15−0.59 ± 0.051.60 ± 0.06214 ± 24X-F319C0.65 ± 0.0850 ± 17−0.60 ± 0.034.06 ± 0.38240 ± 40X-A342C2.57 ± 0.2640 ± 7−0.88 ± 0.0222.3 ± 1.01005 ± 30For binding assays, cells were incubated with 14 nm[3H]CFT and various concentrations (1 nm to 1 μm) of unlabeled CFT.

Kinetic analysis of DA uptake showed that bothV max and K m were significantly reduced in the mutants (Table I). The uptake properties of X5C, X-A90C, X-A306C, and X-A319C were similar, with theirV max values being 3–7% of WT, andK m values being 10% of WT (Table I). The two mutants retaining normal [3H]CFT binding, X-A135C and X-A342C, showed faster DA uptake rates than the other mutants. However, only X342C displayed near normal properties of DA uptake, as evidenced by V max and K m values within 2-fold of the WT level (Table I). The Hill slopes for DA uptake were close to unity (>0.90) in all cell lines. Both cocaine and m-tyramine inhibited DA uptake by WT and the mutants in a competitive manner. The competitiveK i values for cocaine were similar between WT and the mutants (Table II), consistent with the similar IC50 values for CFT binding to each mutant (Table I). The competitive K i values for the substrate m-tyramine were reduced in the mutants in parallel with the decreases in K m for DA (Table II).Table IIInhibition by cocaine and m-tyramine of DA uptake into intact HEK 293 cells stably expressing wild-type or indicated mutant hDATMutant hDATK i for cocaineK i for m-tyraminenMnMWT320 ± 612607 ± 198X5C230 ± 17317 ± 24X-A90C247 ± 12287 ± 41X-A135C460 ± 108833 ± 55X-A306C250 ± 32253 ± 27X-A342C227 ± 301713 ± 168K i of cocaine or m-tyramine was determined by incubating cells with various concentrations (0.125–8 μm) of DA in the absence and presence of 0.5 μm cocaine or a fixed concentration (more than the IC50 for each particular hDAT) of m-tyramine.

Open table in a new tab K i of cocaine or m-tyramine was determined by incubating cells with various concentrations (0.125–8 μm) of DA in the absence and presence of 0.5 μm cocaine or a fixed concentration (more than the IC50 for each particular hDAT) of m-tyramine. Values are expressed as the means ± SE from three to seven experiments. Reaction of the membrane-impermeant (2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl)methanethiosulfonate (MTSET) (2.5 mm) or (2-sulfonatoethyl)methanethiosulfonate (MTSES) (10 mm) with WT, X5C, X-A135C, and X-A342C slightly reduced DA uptake, consistent with the reaction of residual endogenous cysteines in X5C and the other mutants (Fig.1). Reaction of 2.5 mm MTSET decreased the V max for X5C from 1.66 ± 0.13 to 1.34 ± 0.05 pmol/s/mg (p < 0.05, unpaired t test). In contrast, reaction of MTSET and MTSES with X-A90C and X-A306C produced a statistically significant increase in DA uptake (Fig. 1). Similar effects were also observed with 0.5 and 1 mm MTSET (data not shown). This potentiation resulted from an increase in the V max for DA uptake; before and after treatment with 2.5 mm MTSET, theV max values were 1.58 ± 0.10 and 2.12 ± 0.09 pmol/s/mg for X-A90C and 1.60 ± 0.06 and 2.62 ± 0.09 pmol/s/mg for X-A306C, respectively (p < 0.01, unpaired t test). The K m values for X5C, X-A90C, and X-A306C were increased about 2-fold by MTSET (p < 0.01, unpaired t test; data not shown), indicative of residual reaction of endogenous cysteines in X5C and the other mutants. MTSEA substantially inhibited DA uptake by WT and by all the mutants, including X5C, again consistent with residual reaction of endogenous cysteines (Fig. 1). To test whether the cysteines reacting with MTSEA are different from those reacting with MTSET, we incubated WT or X5C with 2.5 mm MTSET for 2 min followed by another 2-min incubation with 2.5 mm MTSEA. Following this sequential treatment, DA uptake was inhibited to the same degree as observed with MTSEA alone (data not shown), suggesting that an additional cysteine or cysteines react with MTSEA but not with MTSET at the concentration tested. X-A90C appeared to be less sensitive to MTSEA (Fig. 1), likely because the stimulatory effect of MTSEA reacting with Cys-90 partially offset the inhibitory effect of MTSEA reacting with other cysteines. In WT and in X-A342C, the presence of 100 μm m-tyramine 10 min before and during the MTSEA treatment significantly enhanced the MTSEA-induced inactivation of DA uptake (Fig.2). Similar effects were also observed when 3 or 10 μm m-tyramine were added with MTSEA (data not shown). This enhancement of reaction was not observed in X5C, X-A135C (Fig. 2), or in any of the other mutants (data not shown). Additionally, the presence of 100 μm m-tyramine 10 min before and during the MTSET (2.5 mm) treatment did not alter the reactivity of WT (82 ± 2% versus 84 ± 2% of control, n = 6) or X-A342C (85 ± 2% versus 88 ± 3%,n = 6) to MTSET. The ability of m-tyramine to enhance the reaction of MTSEA with X-A342C was further examined as a function of time. Fig.3 shows typical time courses of DA uptake by WT or X-A342C after treatment with MTSEA (2.5 mm) for different times in the absence or presence of m-tyramine (100 μm). The clearance of DA by the cells, as indicated by the decrease in the concentration of medium DA, was slowed by MTSEA. The presence of m-tyramine (100 μm) 10 min before and during the treatment of MTSEA substantially accelerated the inactivation of DA uptake by MTSEA, as inferred from the resulting time curves for DA uptake (Fig. 3, B and D). This effect was clearly observed even after a 0.5-min treatment of MTSEA (Figs. 3 and 4). In WT, MTSEA inhibited DA uptake with rate constants of 5.4 ± 1.3 and 9.2 ± 0.9m−1 s−1 in the absence and presence, respectively, of m-tyramine (p < 0.01, paired t test). In X-A342C, MTSEA inhibited DA uptake with rate constants of 4.3 ± 1.7 and 7.5 ± 1.6m−1 s−1 in the absence and presence, respectively, of m-tyramine (p < 0.01, paired t test).Figure 4Time dependence of MTSEA inactivation of WT and X-A342C.

If present before but not during incubation with MTSEA, but with MTSEA added in the presence of lithium rather than sodium, (condition 4), m-tyramine did not enhance the reactivity of MTSEA (Fig. 5). Similar results were also observed in WT (data not shown). To determine whether m-tyramine acts during binding or translocation to enhance the reactivity of MTSEA with X-A342C, we compared the abilities of m-tyramine to enhance MTSEA reactivity at 21 and 4 °C, under conditions optimized to produce equivalent inhibition by MTSEA. Incubation of the cells with MTSEA (2.5 mm) for 12 min at 4 °C reduced subsequent DA uptake at 37 °C to approximately 70% of control levels. Under these conditions, m-tyramine failed to enhance the reactivity of MTSEA (Fig. 6 A). In comparison, although incubation with MTSEA for 0.5 min at 21 °C also reduced DA uptake to approximately 70% of control levels, under these conditions m-tyramine caused a statistically significant enhancement of the reactivity of MTSEA (Fig. 6 A). The uptake of m-tyramine was extremely slow at 4 °C but appreciable at 21 °C (Fig. 6 B). Thus, at low temperatures, wherem-tyramine binds to DAT but is not substantially translocated, it does not enhance the reactivity of MTSEA with X-A342C. With 10 μm m-tyramine present during MTSEA treatment, cocaine almost completely abolished the enhancement of reaction with X-A342C by m-tyramine (Fig.7 B). With 100 μm m-tyramine present during MTSEA treatment under the same conditions, the cocaine protection was significant but incomplete (data not shown), likely because the concentration of m-tyramine was too high for cocaine to compete effectively and fully inhibit transport. With m-tyramine incubation before but not during treatment with MTSEA, cocaine also almost completely protected against the m-tyramine enhancement in the reactivity of X-A342C (Fig. 7 C). In contrast, the presence of cocaine (10 μm) did not protect against inactivation of DA uptake by MTSEA in the absence of m-tyramine, suggesting that reaction with residual background cysteines is not protected (Fig. 2). The DAT construct X5C, with five mutated cysteines (C90A, C135A, C306A, C319F, and C342A) and the constructs into which the wild-type cysteines were substituted back into X5C, one at a time, all bound [3H]CFT with an affinity close to that of WT. Moreover, dopamine uptake by each of these mutants was inhibited by cocaine with nearly normal affinity. X5C, X-A90C, X-A306C, and X-F319C all expressed at significantly lower levels than did WT, X-A135C, and X-A342C. Despite their nearly normal affinities for CFT and cocaine, the mutants displayed altered DA uptake with significant reductions in bothK m and V max. Analysis of DA uptake by the mutants with the individual cysteines restored indicated that these alterations in uptake might be mainly caused by mutation of Cys-342, in the intracellular loop between transmembrane domains 6 and 7. Thus, replacement of Cys-342 alone into X5C restored theK m and V max to within about 2-fold of that of WT. Further, if [3H]CFT bound to intact cells primarily reflects the surface expression of the transporter, our data imply that the turnover rate may also be significantly improved by introduction of Cys-342. Notably, in rat DAT or serotonin transporter, a single mutation of the cysteine aligned with hDAT Cys-342 did not affect substrate uptake (20.Wang J.B. Moriwaki A. Uhl G.R. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 1416-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 26.Sur C. Schloss P. Betz H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 68-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). These experiments, however, were performed at a single low concentration of labeled substrate, and our observation of decreases in both the K m andV max is therefore consistent with these previous reports but shows that the detailed process of uptake is altered by mutation of Cys-342. Although it is possible that introduction of Cys-342 to X5C improves uptake by enhancing the structural stabilization during synthesis and surface expression of the transporter, the effects of modification of X-A342C with sulfhydryl reagents and the effect of substrate on the reactivity of X-A342C also highlight a potential role of this residue in substrate transport (see below). The similar binding and uptake kinetics among X5C, X-A90C, and X-A306C suggest that Cys-90 and Cys-306, the two cysteines in extracellula"

The Aβ peptide is secreted by numerous cell types in the body but the amyloid deposits are only present in the central nervous system.The amyloid deposits are formed by the aggregation of individual monomers of Aβ peptide into very large polymers which have a fibril-like appearance when observed in an electron microscope (5.Kirschner D.A.

These polymers can also be observed by light microscopy following staining with certain histological dyes such as Congo red and thioflavine T (6.Taylor D.L. Allen R.D. Benditt E.P. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1974; 22: 1105-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).Soluble Aβ peptide can be detected in blood and cerebrospinal fluid. The levels are, however, very low, usually in the low nano- to picomolar range and at these concentrations the peptide polymerizes at a very slow rate (7.Jarrett J.T. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Cell. 1993; 73: 1055-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar). A number of recent studies on the mechanisms of amyloid formation have conclusively shown that the presence of preformed oligo- or polymers of the amyloid peptide in the reaction mixture increases the polymerization rate dramatically (7.Jarrett J.T.

Apolipoprotein E4, a well established risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (10.Strittmatter W.J. Weisgraber K.H. Huang D.Y. Dong L.M. Salvesen G.S. Pericak-Vance M. Schmechel D. Saunders A.M.

In the case of apolipoprotein E, there are conflicting data suggesting that the protein can enhance as well as inhibit amyloidogenesis (14.Wood S.J. Chan W. Wetzel R. Chem.

A. 1995; 92: 763-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar).The existence of putative co-factors capable of enhancing amyloid formation potentially offers new targets for pharmaceuticals for use in the treatment of amyloid disorders. However, so far very little is known about how such compounds might work, and it is therefore difficult to develop assays for finding candidate pharmaceuticals and to predict their molecular mode of action.A number of molecules which function as amyloid ligands have been described. These include the textile dyes Congo red and thioflavine T that bind to amyloid fibrils but not to nonpolymerized peptide. These compounds, therefore, have found widespread use in histopathological diagnosis of amyloid disorders. The elements in the amyloid fibril that these compounds bind to are probably the novel surfaces or binding pockets generated as a result of amyloid peptide polymerization (16.Turnell W.G. Finch J.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 1205-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In addition to these small organic molecules there are also peptide-based ligands. The rationale behind such ligands is that during polymerization short stretches of amino acid residues interact and form β-strands that join the monomers encompassing the fibril (17.Hilbich C. Kisters-Woike B. Reed J. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 460-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 18.Fraser P.E. Nguyen J.T. Surewicz W.K. Kirschner D.A. Biophys.

It was speculated that short peptides corresponding to one of the strands in the β-sheet can bind to the amyloid peptide/protein. With this approach, ligands capable of interfering with amyloid formationin vitro and possibly also in vivo have been identified (20.Tjernberg L.O. Näslund J. Lindqvist F. Johansson J.

Frangione B. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 822-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar).Here, we first investigated if nonpeptidic, synthetic molecules of low molecular weight can have similar effects as the larger natural substances described above. By having access to molecules that easily can be altered structurally, the mechanism through which small molecules regulate the higher order structure of the Aβ peptide can be probed with a more rational, structure based, approach than otherwise. Moreover, small synthetic molecules with pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties allowing them to be easily administered to animals, may also be useful in studies of amyloidogenesis in vivo.DISCUSSIONHere it has been shown that RO-47-1816/001, a synthetic compound with a molecular mass of 592 Da accelerates polymerization of amyloid peptides several times its own size. There are only a few known examples of small molecule compounds regulating the state of polymerization of proteins. The most well known compounds of this class are probably colchicine and paclitaxel (previously taxol), that induce disassembly and assembly, respectively, of microtubuli and are used clinically to treat gout and neoplasms (34.Hardman J.G. Limbird L. Molinoff P.B. Ruddon R.W. Gilman A.G. Goodman & Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics. 9th Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York1996Google Scholar).Binding studies showed that RO-47-1816/001 displayed affinity both to Aβ-amyloid as well as to amyloid formed by a peptide derived from the prion protein (Prp106–126). This is a feature shared by several other organic compounds, including Congo red and thioflavine T. It is believed that the novel surfaces generated as a result of the adoption of β-pleated sheet structures during polymerization serve as binding sites for these amyloid ligands (35.Klunk W.E. Debnath M.L. Koros A.M. Pettegrew J.W. Life Sci. 1998; 63: 1807-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This property of the compounds is widely used to histochemically distinguish amyloid from normal tissue. Because Congo red could interfere with the action of RO-47-1816/001, it is reasonable to assume that the latter interacted with the same binding site(s) as the former and that this site(s) therefore can be of importance for putative amyloid-enhancing compounds and their antagonists.It was interesting to observe that analogues of the amyloid ligand RO-47-1816/001 failed to produce an accelerating effect on amyloid formation despite having similar affinities to Aβ as the original compound. This initially surprising finding was later explained when it was revealed that the inactive ligands insteadantagonized the effect of RO-47-1816/001. The present finding therefore suggests that RO-47-1816/001 exerts its action not only by binding to the amyloid polymer but that it also has an additional effect that the antagonists do not possess. It is tempting to speculate that RO-47-1816/001, after it has bound to the amyloid fibril, binds to the soluble peptide and brings it into close proximity to the fibril (Fig. 8), thereby facilitating docking of the peptides via their specific binding sequences (20.Tjernberg L.O.

Whether cross-linking is mediated directly by RO-47-1816/001 or by a composite surface of RO-47-1816/001 and the Aβ polymer is not clear. The latter mechanism is, however, more favored in nature. The most well known example is probably the interaction of the T-cell receptor with its antigen. The affinity of the receptor for a peptide antigen per se is low but when bound to and presented by the major histocompatibility complex, the affinity increases dramatically. Under these circumstances, the T-cell receptor can bind both to the antigen and the major histocompatibility complex (37.Garboczi D.N. Ghosh P. Utz U. Fan Q.R. Biddison W.E. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1996; 384: 134-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar, 38.Garcia K.C. Degano M. Stanfield R.L. Brunmark A. Jackson M.R. Peterson P.A. Teyton L. Wilson I.A. Science. 1996; 274: 209-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar), and the increased number of contacts leads to increased affinity.There are also examples of natural compounds being used as pharmaceuticals that employ this strategy in mediating their specific action. Cyclosporin A and FK506 both inhibit calcineurin by forming a complex with cyclophilin and FK506-binding protein, respectively, that display high affinity toward the phosphatase (39.Liu J. Farmer Jr., J.D. Lane W.S. Friedman J. Weissman I. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1991; 66: 807-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3567) Google Scholar, 40.Schreiber S.L. Crabtree G.R. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 136-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1947) Google Scholar). Recently, this mechanism was elegantly used to increase the affinity of a bifunctional ligand designed to induce heterodimerization of the FK506-binding protein and an SH2 domain (41.Briesewitz R. Ray G.T. Wandless T.J. Crabtree G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1953-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).It is not clear if the ability to enhance polymerization of amyloid peptides is a common feature in small organic molecules or if it is restricted to a very small number of substances. We do, however, want to point to the possibility that clinically used pharmaceuticals may have this property and, at least theoretically, may promote amyloidogenesis in vivo.It can be speculated that the present results suggest that the brain might contain small endogenous compounds having similar effects as RO-47-1816/001. Apolipoprotein E (apoE) and gangliosides have been mentioned previously, but it is still possible that there are other natural compounds with similar effects. An interesting observation by Selkoe and co-workers (42.Podlisny M.B. Walsh D.M. Amarante P. Ostaszewski B.L. Stimson E.R. Maggio J.E. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3602-3611Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) is that Congo red stabilizes monomeric Aβ in cell culture supernatant, which may suggest that compounds with similar effects as those of RO-47-1816/001 may be secreted by cells. Finally, the finding presented here, that some compounds, including Congo red, displaying affinity for amyloid can antagonize the action of amyloid enhancers, may therefore be of therapeutic significance. The amyloid deposits in brain vasculature and parenchyma that are the main histopathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (1.Selkoe D.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 373-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar) are composed of large polymers of Alzheimer β-amyloid peptide (Aβ).1 This peptide is present in two major forms, one being 40 amino acids long, and the other, more aggregable form being 42 amino acids long (2.Glenner G.G. Wong C.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 122: 1131-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1241) Google Scholar, 3.Glenner G.G. Wong C.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The levels are, however, very low, usually in the low nano- to picomolar range and at these concentrations the peptide polymerizes at a very slow rate (7.Jarrett J.T. Lansbury Jr., P.T.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3602-3611Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) is that Congo red stabilizes monomeric Aβ in cell culture supernatant, which may suggest that compounds with similar effects as those of RO-47-1816/001 may be secreted by cells. Finally, the finding presented here, that some compounds, including Congo red, displaying affinity for amyloid can antagonize the action of amyloid enhancers, may therefore be of therapeutic significance. Here it has been shown that RO-47-1816/001, a synthetic compound with a molecular mass of 592 Da accelerates polymerization of amyloid peptides several times its own size. There are only a few known examples of small molecule compounds regulating the state of polymerization of proteins. The most well known compounds of this class are probably colchicine and paclitaxel (previously taxol), that induce disassembly and assembly, respectively, of microtubuli and are used clinically to treat gout and neoplasms (34.Hardman J.G. Limbird L. Molinoff P.B. Ruddon R.W. Gilman A.G. Goodman & Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics. 9th Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York1996Google Scholar). Binding studies showed that RO-47-1816/001 displayed affinity both to Aβ-amyloid as well as to amyloid formed by a peptide derived from the prion protein (Prp106–126). This is a feature shared by several other organic compounds, including Congo red and thioflavine T. It is believed that the novel surfaces generated as a result of the adoption of β-pleated sheet structures during polymerization serve as binding sites for these amyloid ligands (35.Klunk W.E. Debnath M.L. Koros A.M. Pettegrew J.W. Life Sci. 1998; 63: 1807-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This property of the compounds is widely used to histochemically distinguish amyloid from normal tissue. Because Congo red could interfere with the action of RO-47-1816/001, it is reasonable to assume that the latter interacted with the same binding site(s) as the former and that this site(s) therefore can be of importance for putative amyloid-enhancing compounds and their antagonists. It was interesting to observe that analogues of the amyloid ligand RO-47-1816/001 failed to produce an accelerating effect on amyloid formation despite having similar affinities to Aβ as the original compound. This initially surprising finding was later explained when it was revealed that the inactive ligands insteadantagonized the effect of RO-47-1816/001. The present finding therefore suggests that RO-47-1816/001 exerts its action not only by binding to the amyloid polymer but that it also has an additional effect that the antagonists do not possess. It is tempting to speculate that RO-47-1816/001, after it has bound to the amyloid fibril, binds to the soluble peptide and brings it into close proximity to the fibril (Fig. 8), thereby facilitating docking of the peptides via their specific binding sequences (20.Tjernberg L.O.

Whether cross-linking is mediated directly by RO-47-1816/001 or by a composite surface of RO-47-1816/001 and the Aβ polymer is not clear. The latter mechanism is, however, more favored in nature. The most well known example is probably the interaction of the T-cell receptor with its antigen. The affinity of the receptor for a peptide antigen per se is low but when bound to and presented by the major histocompatibility complex, the affinity increases dramatically. Under these circumstances, the T-cell receptor can bind both to the antigen and the major histocompatibility complex (37.Garboczi D.N. Ghosh P. Utz U. Fan Q.R. Biddison W.E. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1996; 384: 134-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar, 38.Garcia K.C. Degano M. Stanfield R.L. Brunmark A. Jackson M.R. Peterson P.A. Teyton L. Wilson I.A. Science. 1996; 274: 209-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar), and the increased number of contacts leads to increased affinity. There are also examples of natural compounds being used as pharmaceuticals that employ this strategy in mediating their specific action. Cyclosporin A and FK506 both inhibit calcineurin by forming a complex with cyclophilin and FK506-binding protein, respectively, that display high affinity toward the phosphatase (39.Liu J. Farmer Jr., J.D. Lane W.S. Friedman J. Weissman I. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1991; 66: 807-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3567) Google Scholar, 40.Schreiber S.L. Crabtree G.R. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 136-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1947) Google Scholar). Recently, this mechanism was elegantly used to increase the affinity of a bifunctional ligand designed to induce heterodimerization of the FK506-binding protein and an SH2 domain (41.Briesewitz R. Ray G.T. Wandless T.J. Crabtree G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1953-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). It is not clear if the ability to enhance polymerization of amyloid peptides is a common feature in small organic molecules or if it is restricted to a very small number of substances. We do, however, want to point to the possibility that clinically used pharmaceuticals may have this property and, at least theoretically, may promote amyloidogenesis in vivo. It can be speculated that the present results suggest that the brain might contain small endogenous compounds having similar effects as RO-47-1816/001. Apolipoprotein E (apoE) and gangliosides have been mentioned previously, but it is still possible that there are other natural compounds with similar effects.

https://openalex.org/W2073419788,"Murine T10 and T22 are highly related nonclassical major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class Ib proteins that bind to certain gammadelta T cell receptors (TCRs) in the absence of other components. The crystal structure of T22b at 3.1 angstroms reveals similarities to MHC class I molecules, but one side of the normal peptide-binding groove is severely truncated, which allows direct access to the beta-sheet floor. Potential gammadelta TCR-binding sites can be inferred from functional mapping of T10 and T22 point mutants and allelic variants. Thus, T22 represents an unusual variant of the MHC-like fold and indicates that gammadelta and alphabeta TCRs interact differently with their respective MHC ligands."

In many insects, JHE is the predominant anti-JH enzyme found in the hemolymph (blood); JHE hydrolyzes JH to produce JH acid and thereby regulates the titer of circulating JH (1.Hammock B.D. Kerkut G.A. Gilbert L.I. Comprehensive Insect Physiology, Biochemistry, and Pharmacology. Pergamon Press, New York1985: 431-472Google Scholar). The importance of precisely regulated JH and JHE in insect development has been demonstrated by topical application of JH analogs or the JHE inhibitor 3-n-octylthio-1,1,1-trifluoro-2-propanone to Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths), which can result in production of giant larvae (2.Abdel-Aal Y.A.I. Hammock B.D. Science. 1986; 233: 1073-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Conversely, larval development is impeded by removal of the corpora allata, which synthesize JH.During development of lepidopteran larvae, the titers of JHE and JH are inversely regulated; hemolymph JH titers are high when JHE titers are low and vice versa. The titer of circulating JHE is regulated in part by differential transcription rates in fat body tissue (3.Wroblewski V.J. Harshman L.G. Hanzlik T.N. Hammock B.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 278: 461-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). JHE is also cleared from the hemolymph by pericardial cells (4.Crossley A.C. Kerkut G.A. Gilbert L.I.

The molecular processes involved in the processing and degradation of JHE in pericardial cells are unknown.In earlier work, immunoelectron micrographs showed that targeting of JHE to lysosomes in pericardial cells was perturbed when two lysine residues of JHE (Lys29 and Lys524) were mutated to arginines (10.Bonning B.C.

Here, the results of screening aManduca sexta pericardial cell cDNA phage display library for proteins that bind JHE are described.DISCUSSIONLepidopteran insects regulate titers of JHE to achieve the regulation of JH in the hemolymph that is required for development. Hemolymph JHE titers are regulated in part through clearance via receptor-mediated endocytosis into pericardial cells. The endocytosed enzyme is targeted to lysosomes for degradation. In earlier work, we observed that mutation of two residues in JHE perturbed lysosomal targeting of the enzyme in pericardial cells (10.Bonning B.C. Ward V.K. van Meer M. Booth T.F. Hammock B.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6007-6012Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this perturbed protein targeting was shown to result in toxicity to the insect: a recombinant baculovirus expressing the mutant enzyme JHE K29R/K524R killed the host insect significantly faster than a baculovirus expressing JHE (10.Bonning B.C.

Pathol. 1999; 73: 234-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The present study was based on the hypothesis that disruption of lysosomal targeting of JHE K29R/K524R results from decreased affinity for a binding protein involved in protein sorting in the endocytotic pathway. Here, we report the characterization of P29, which is present in pericardial cell and fat body tissues and shows reduced binding to JHE K29R/K524R relative to JHE.Previous research showed that targeting of JHE K29R/K524R to lysosomes in pericardial cells was significantly less efficient than targeting of JHE (10.Bonning B.C. Ward V.K. van Meer M. Booth T.F. Hammock B.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6007-6012Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Our data on reduced binding of P29 to JHE K29R/K524R imply a role for P29 in JHE targeting or processing in lysosomes. P29 is also present in the fat body, which is not involved in uptake of JHE, but is involved in endocytosis of other hemolymph proteins (25.Haunerland N.H. Insect Biochem. Molec. Biol. 1996; 26: 755-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The fat body is also a site of synthesis of JHE (3.Wroblewski V.J. Harshman L.G. Hanzlik T.N. Hammock B.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 278: 461-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To deduce the function of P29, immunoelectron microscopy will be used to determine the intracellular location of P29 and the sites of colocalization with JHE in the two tissues.Because M. sexta JHE had not been cloned at the beginning of this study, recombinant JHE derived from the tobacco budwormHeliothis virescens (26.Hanzlik T.N. Abdel-Aal Y.A.I. Harshman L.G. Hammock B.D. J. Biol.

Ligand blotting with H. virescens-derived JHE against H. virescens pericardial cell and fat body tissues showed the same profiles as blots with M. sextatissues. 2M. Shanmugavelu and B. C. Bonning, unpublished data. H. virescens JHE shares 54% identity with M. sextaJHE. 3A. C. Hinton and B. D. Hammock, unpublished data. Based on these observations, we expect the processing of the two enzymes to be comparable.Use of the phage display library enabled the simultaneous screening for JHE-binding proteins and isolation of the cDNAs encoding binding proteins. cDNAs encoding potential JHE-binding proteins were selectively enriched in the phage display library by interaction of the gene products with JHE. This is the first time that phage display has been used successfully for screening of a tissue-derived library for specific binding proteins. The results highlight the importance of eliminating false positives, which may result from frameshifting (27.Carcamo J. Ravera M.W. Brissette R. Dedova O. Beasley J.R. Alam-Moghe A. Wan C. Blume A. Mandecki W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11146-11151Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) or from production of artificial peptides. Proteins detected for clones with no open reading frame in the cDNA insert are likely to have resulted from the insert being out of frame or from an incomplete coding sequence. The phage display technique limited the clone insert size to ∼1 kilobase. There are clearly larger proteins in the pericardial cell complex that bind to JHE and that were not isolated using this technique (Fig. 3 B). We are currently using alternative means to isolate and to characterize these proteins.

P29 is also present in the fat body, which is not involved in uptake of JHE, but is involved in endocytosis of other hemolymph proteins (25.Haunerland N.H. Insect Biochem. Molec. Biol. 1996; 26: 755-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The fat body is also a site of synthesis of JHE (3.Wroblewski V.J. Harshman L.G. Hanzlik T.N. Hammock B.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 278: 461-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To deduce the function of P29, immunoelectron microscopy will be used to determine the intracellular location of P29 and the sites of colocalization with JHE in the two tissues. Because M. sexta JHE had not been cloned at the beginning of this study, recombinant JHE derived from the tobacco budwormHeliothis virescens (26.Hanzlik T.N. Abdel-Aal Y.A.I. Harshman L.G. Hammock B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12419-12425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used for enrichment and screening of the M. sexta pericardial cell cDNA phage display library. Ligand blotting with H. virescens-derived JHE against H. virescens pericardial cell and fat body tissues showed the same profiles as blots with M. sextatissues. 2M. Shanmugavelu and B. C. Bonning, unpublished data. H. virescens JHE shares 54% identity with M. sextaJHE. 3A. C. Hinton and B. D. Hammock, unpublished data. Based on these observations, we expect the processing of the two enzymes to be comparable. Use of the phage display library enabled the simultaneous screening for JHE-binding proteins and isolation of the cDNAs encoding binding proteins. cDNAs encoding potential JHE-binding proteins were selectively enriched in the phage display library by interaction of the gene products with JHE. This is the first time that phage display has been used successfully for screening of a tissue-derived library for specific binding proteins. The results highlight the importance of eliminating false positives, which may result from frameshifting (27.Carcamo J. Ravera M.W. Brissette R. Dedova O. Beasley J.R. Alam-Moghe A. Wan C. Blume A. Mandecki W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11146-11151Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) or from production of artificial peptides. Proteins detected for clones with no open reading frame in the cDNA insert are likely to have resulted from the insert being out of frame or from an incomplete coding sequence. The phage display technique limited the clone insert size to ∼1 kilobase. There are clearly larger proteins in the pericardial cell complex that bind to JHE and that were not isolated using this technique (Fig. 3 B). We are currently using alternative means to isolate and to characterize these proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1969863463,"During AMP-dependent sulfite oxidation by some sulfur bacteria, the liberation of sulfate from adenosine-5′-phosphosulfate (APS) is catalyzed by APS:phosphate adenylyltransferase (APAT). Here we report the first biochemical and genetic characterization of APAT. We isolated this enzyme from the chemolithoautotroph Thiobacillus denitrificans and cloned the corresponding gene. The enzyme is homodimeric with 41,387-Da subunits and exhibits a specific activity of 2100 μmol min−1 mg−1. The K m values are K m(APS) = 300 μm andK m(Pi) = 12 mm. Catalysis occurs by a ping-pong mechanism with a covalently bound AMP as reaction intermediate. The arsenolysis of APS , but not of ADP, CDP, GDP, UDP, or IDP, is also catalyzed, indicating a specific and unidirectional function. The former enzyme name ADP-sulfurylase implies that the reverse reaction is catalyzed; therefore, this name should not be used any longer. Histidine modification of APAT results in complete inactivation that can be suppressed by substrate addition. APAT is highly similar to galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase and also related to Ap4A phosphorylase. Active site residues of galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase are conserved in APAT and Ap4A phosphorylase, suggesting a histidine as the nucleotide-binding residue in all three enzymes, which together form a new family of nucleotidyltransferases.

Wood A.P. Antonie van Leeuwenhoek. 1997; 71: 95-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Two sulfite oxidation pathways may play a role in this dissimilatory oxidative sulfur metabolism as follows: (a) direct oxidation of sulfite to sulfate by sulfite:acceptor oxidoreductase (EC 1.8.2.1), and (b) indirect AMP-dependent oxidation of sulfite to sulfate via the intermediate APS.1 In the latter pathway APS is formed from sulfite and AMP by the enzyme APS reductase (EC 1.8.99.2) acting in reverse. Sulfate is released from APS in a second step either by ATP sulfurylase (EC 2.7.7.4) or by APS:phosphate adenylyltransferase (APAT) (3.Smith D.W. Strohl W.R. Shively J.M. Barton L.L. Variations in Autotrophic Life. Academic Press, London1991: 121-146Google Scholar, 4.Dahl C. Trüper H.G. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 243: 400-421Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The AMP moiety of APS is transferred either to pyrophosphate by ATP sulfurylase or to phosphate by APAT, resulting in the formation of ATP or ADP, respectively. Since ADP can be converted to ATP and AMP by adenylate kinase, both sulfate-liberating enzymes catalyze substrate phosphorylations that may be of energetic importance, especially in chemolithoautotrophic bacteria (5.Peck Jr., H.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.A. 1960; 46: 1053-1057Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Significant APAT activity has been reported from various chemotrophic and phototrophic sulfur bacteria (5.Peck Jr., H.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.A. 1960; 46: 1053-1057Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Thiele H.H. Antonie van Leeuwenhoek. 1968; 34: 350-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 7.Khanna S. Nicholas D.J.D. J. Gen.

However, in contrast to ATP-sulfurylase, APAT has never been purified from a bacterium, and a corresponding gene has never been cloned. This led some authors (11.Renosto F. Martin R.L. Borrell J.L. Nelson D.C. Segel I.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 290: 66-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) to suggest that APAT does not exist as an enzymatic entity. Observed activities were tentatively explained by the occurrence of side reactions of other enzymes or by incorrect enzyme assays (11.Renosto F. Martin R.L. Borrell J.L. Nelson D.C. Segel I.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 290: 66-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 12.Hagen K.D. Nelson D.C. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 3957-3964Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To examine the existence and properties of APAT, we studied the activity from Thiobacillus denitrificans biochemically and genetically. Tb. denitrificans strain RT (DSMZ 807) was grown anaerobically on thiosulfate and nitrate as described elsewhere (13.Schedel M. Trüper H.G. Arch. Microbiol. 1980; 124: 205-210Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested at late exponential growth phase and kept frozen at −70 °C until use. APS was synthesized from AMP, sulfite, and ferricyanide using APS reductase activity of Tb. denitrificans crude extracts by a method essentially as described elsewhere (14.Cooper B.P. Trüper H.G. Z. Naturforsch. 1979; 34C: 346-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) but modified to obtain salt-free APS after only one chromatographic step. APS synthesis was terminated by boiling for 10 min. Precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation (17,540 ×g, 4 °C, 30 min). In 5-ml aliquots the supernatant was loaded onto a 95 × 3 cm G-25 gel filtration column equilibrated with water (flow rate, 1 ml min−1). APS eluted after a yellow ferricyanide peak and before AMP. Fractions were tested by thin layer chromatography for purity (14.Cooper B.P. Trüper H.G. Z. Naturforsch. 1979; 34C: 346-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). AMP-free fractions of APS were pooled. The APS concentration was determined photometrically (ε259 nm = 15.4 mm−1cm−1) and enzymatically in APAT assays coupled with pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase (see below). APAT activity was measured in a coupled photometric assay system. The assay contained 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.6, 400 μm APS, 1 mm sodium phophoenolpyruvate, 200 μm NADH, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 units of pyruvate kinase, 10 units of lactic acid dehydrogenase, and 10 μl of the tested protein solution in a final volume of 0.5 ml. The activity was derived from the velocity of NADH oxidation (ε366 nm= 3.3 mm−1 cm−1). Since no interfering NADH oxidase activity was detectable, the reaction was started by addition of the protein tested. Start by addition of phosphate or APS gave identical velocities. For determination of the optimum pH, the mixture contained 100 mm Tris glycine buffer of the desired pH. K m values andV max for saturating second substrate concentrations were determined from initial velocities at varied substrate concentrations graphically according to Cleland (15.Cleland W.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1963; 67: 188-196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). APAT was also assayed by thin layer chromatography after incubation of protein with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.6, and 400 μm APS at 30 °C. Chromatograms were developed with isopropyl alcohol:ammonia (33%):water (6:3:1) on F254 silica gel sheets (Merck). This test was especially used to detect APAT in fractions after chromatography. The presence of ATP sulfurylase, ATPase, and adenylate kinase activities were similarly tested by TLC. Phosphate was substituted by 1 mm pyrophosphate in ATP sulfurylase assays. APS was substituted by ADP or ATP for adenylate kinase or ATPase assays, respectively. Phosphate was omitted in those assays. For arsenolysis and molybdolysis, phosphate was replaced by 5 mmNa2HAsO4 or 5 mmNa2MoO4, respectively. To measure the effects of 1 mm MgCl2 or 1 mmMnCl2 on the reaction kinetics, samples were taken in minute intervals from reactions with or without the metal salt, and the turnover was compared by thin layer chromatography. In some assays APS was replaced by 400 μm or 5 mm ADP, GDP, CDP, UDP, or IDP. The concentration of the NDPs was determined photometrically (ADP, ε259 nm = 15.4 mm−1 cm−1; GDP, ε252 nm = 13.7 mm−1cm−1; CDP, ε271 nm = 9.1 mm−1 cm−1; UDP, ε262 nm = 10.0 mm−1cm−1; IDP, ε249 nm = 12.3 mm−1 cm−1). In some assays metal salts were added as indicated in the text. Nucleotides were analyzed by thin layer chromatography as described above. 18 g of cell paste (wet weight) were thawed and resuspended in 2 volumes of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6 (containing 20 mm MgCl2 and some grains of DNase). Cells were broken by sonification (1 min ml−1pulsed mode, Branson Sonifier), and cell debris was removed by centrifugation (30 min, 17,540 × g, 4 °C). The membranes were separated from the supernatant by ultracentrifugation (90 min, 143,000 × g, 4 °C). About 70% of the APAT activity was located in the supernatant after ultracentrifugation. The supernatant was immediately loaded on a 100 ml DEAE-Sephacel (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column (4 °C, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, flow rate: 2 ml min−1). Bound protein was eluted in a 400-ml gradient of 0–400 mm NaCl in 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6. APAT eluted at 100–160 mm NaCl. Active fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6 (4 °C). Subsequently, the solution was brought to 40% (NH4)2SO4 saturation. After 1 h of incubation on ice, precipitated protein was separated by centrifugation (30 min, 17,540 × g, 4 °C). The supernatant contained >80% of the activity and was diluted to 30% saturation before hydrophobic interaction chromatography on a low substitution Phenyl-Sepharose matrix (40-ml matrix, equilibrated with 30% saturated (NH4)2SO4 in 20 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 4 °C, flow rate: 1 ml min−1). Bound protein was eluted by decreasing the (NH4)2SO4 concentration in a nonlinear gradient (30–20% saturation in 20 ml, 20–0% saturation in 150 ml). APAT eluted at 10–5% saturation. Active fractions were pooled, dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, and loaded on a Mono P column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, 0.5 ml min−1, 20 megapascals, room temperature) which was thereafter equilibrated with 20 mm histidine, pH 5.6. After pH 5.6 was reached, the buffer was changed to polybuffer (Poly 74, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, 1:15 diluted, pH 3.9). Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected in 1.5-ml tubes containing 20 μl of 0.5 mTris-HCl, pH 7.6, for immediate stabilization of the enzyme. At pH 4.6 the enzyme eluted from the column. Active fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6. During dialysis contaminating protein precipitated reproducibly and was removed by centrifugation (10 min, 18,180 × g, 4 °C). The supernatant was concentrated to 0.5 ml by ultrafiltration centrifugation (Centriprep, Amicon). The concentrated protein was immediately loaded on a Superdex 200 16/60 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, in 150 mm NaCl using a flow rate of 0.5 ml min−1. APAT eluted in a symmetric peak at 78 ml (K av = 0.40). The native molecular weight was determined by gel filtration chromatography on a Superdex 200 column (calibration standards, Roche Molecular Biochemicals combithek and flavocytochrome c (16.Reinartz M. Tschäpe J. Brüser T. Trüper H.G. Dahl C. Arch. Microbiol. 1998; 170: 59-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar)). Purity and subunit molecular weight of the protein were determined by SDS-PAGE using the Mini Protean II-Cell (Bio-Rad) and the Laemmli method (17.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar) with 12.5% T separating gels. Gels were Coomassie-stained. SDS-PAGE markers were obtained from Sigma. All incubations (100 μl total volume) were carried out at room temperature. Bovine serum albumin (5 mg ml−1) was present to stabilize APAT. For APS protection assays 200 μm APS was present. DEPC (2.5 mm) in 200 mm Bis-Tris, pH 6.0, was used to modify accessible histidines. The reaction was carried out at pH 6.0 for optimized His-specific modification (18.Farley J.R. Christie E.A. Seubert P.A. Segel I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3537-3542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 4 mm5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (in 50 mm Na-EPPS, pH 8.0) and 10 mm iodoacetamide (in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0) were used to modify accessible sulfhydryl groups (18.Farley J.R. Christie E.A. Seubert P.A. Segel I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3537-3542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,19.Steinert P.M. Baliga B.S. Munro H.M. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 59: 416-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). 10 mm phenylglyoxal (in 100 mm bicarbonate buffer pH 8.0) and 10 mm diacetyl (in 100 mmborate buffer pH 9.0) were used to modify accessible arginines (18.Farley J.R. Christie E.A. Seubert P.A. Segel I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3537-3542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In all modification experiments 20 μl of the solution were assayed after desired times for remaining APAT activity, using the photometric assay system. 1 ml of purified APAT was concentrated immediately after the gel filtration step to a final volume of 50 μl (Amicon Centricon system, 10-kDa cut off). This concentration step stabilized enzymatic activity and allowed detection of the enzyme by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight-mass spectroscopy (MALDI-TOF-MS). MALDI-TOF-MS was carried out using a Voyager RP Workstation (Perkin-Elmer). The sample (∼1–3 μm) was 10-fold diluted with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, thereafter 1:1 mixed with 110 mm sinapinic acid (3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid) in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 67% acetonitrile, and air-dried. Measurements were carried out in a linear mode. Further parameters are given in the legend of the corresponding figure. For detection of the enzyme-AMP-intermediate the sample was incubated with 17 μm APS for 5 min at room temperature and treated as described above. Standard methods were used for molecular techniques (20.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Escherichia coli DH5α was used for all cloning steps. From the N-terminal amino acid sequence information obtained by automated Edman degradation (SDNQSAPNEIREIRINPIVP) degenerate primers were derived and used for polymerase chain reaction to amplify a 5′-region of the gene. The following primer combination gave a product of the expected size (53 base pairs): forward primer, 5′-ATG TC(GC) GA(CT) AA(CT) CA(GA) TC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GG(GA) TT(GA) AT(GA) CG(GA) AT(TC) TC-3′. The product was cloned in pGEM-T (Promega) and sequenced using a silver sequencing kit (Promega). The sequence coded for the expected residues of the N terminus. The cloned fragment served as template for the polymerase chain reaction generation of a digoxygenin-labeled gene probe using again the degenerate oligonucleotides. A restriction map was constructed by Southern blot analysis (60 °C hybridization and washing temperature), and a 2.97-kilobase pair EcoRI-SalI fragment was isolated from a partial Tb. denitrificansgenebank of 2.4–3.2-kilobase pair EcoRI-SalI fragments in pBluescript SK II(+). The correct clone (pTDA1) was identified by restriction analysis and verified by activity determination in the heterologous system. The complete fragment was sequenced on one strand, the gene for APAT (apt) was identified, and both strands of it were sequenced. Sequencing of pTDA1 was done commercially with Applied Biosystems sequencers and the dye terminator method, using either standard T7 or T3 promoter primers or sequence derived primers. The sequence of apt was deposited at GenBankTM (accession number AF148553). All chemicals were obtained from Sigma, Aldrich, Fluka, or Roche Molecular Biochemicals and were of highest grade. For arsenolysis experiments, ADP was further purified by anion exchange, to separate it from AMP, which is present in commercially available ADP in significant amounts. Yeast galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase was obtained from Sigma. The purification data are summarized in TableI. The gel filtration purification step indicated a native molecular mass of 82 ± 8 kDa. SDS-PAGE analysis of fractions after gel filtration showed a single band at 41 ± 1 kDa which correlated in its intensity exactly with the elution peak absorption and APAT activity and therefore was identified as APAT (Fig. 1). Native and subunit molecular weights strongly suggest a homodimeric structure of APAT. The purified enzyme exhibited a specific activity of 2100 units mg−1 under standard assay conditions. All further kinetic analysis and all experiments on the reactivity of the enzyme under various conditions were done using purified APAT which was stabilized with 5 mg ml−1 bovine serum albumin.Table IPurification of Tb. denitrificans APATMethodActivityTotal activityProteinSpecific activityRelative purityYieldunits ml −1unitsmg ml −1units mg −1%17,540 × gsupernatant48.5194036.81.321100Soluble fraction43.6174420.22.161.690Membrane fraction13.955613.51.03DEAE-Sephacel49.79197.46.725.147>40% (NH4)2SO422.37141.8612.09.137Phenyl-Sepharose13.95280.3836.62727Mono P76.83460.1264048518Superdex 200212310.012100159112 Open table in a new tab The optimum pH for catalysis was at pH 8.5–9.0. At higher pH some precipitation occurred. To ensure high activity of APAT and the coupled enzymes, all further kinetic analyses were carried out at pH 8.0. Variation of one substrate concentration at several fixed second substrate concentrations resulted in activities that gave a set of parallel lines in Lineweaver-Burk plots (Fig.2). This finding strongly indicated a Ping Pong Bi Bi reaction mechanism that involves the formation of a stable enzyme-bound reaction intermediate from reaction with the first substrate (APS) before binding of the second substrate (Pi). The K m values areK m(APS) = 300 μm andK m(Pi) = 12 mm at saturated second substrate concentrations. Due to the ping-pong mechanism significantly lower apparent K mvalues are observed at unsaturated second substrate concentrations. The theoretical V max of the reaction can be estimated to be at 3850 units mg−1 at optimum pH. Divalent cations in the assay (1 mm MgCl2 or 1 mm MnCl2) did not affect activity of the enzyme. A 1-h preincubation of the enzyme with trace metals had no or slightly negative effects on activity. The following metals (1 μm) were tested (remaining activity): CoCl2(98%), CuCl2 (100%), FeCl2 (86%), MnCl2 (96%), NiCl2 (95%), or ZnCl2 (89%). The purified enzyme was subjected to MALDI mass spectrometry. The enzyme molecular mass was determined with this method to be 41,376 ± 20 Da (Fig.3). After incubation of the enzyme with APS (see “Experimental Procedures”), the main mass peak decreased in parallel to an increase of a new peak of 330 ± 2 Da higher mass (Fig. 3). Since a 329-Da mass difference is expected for covalently bound AMP, the new peak observed after APS addition can be attributed to a covalent enzyme-AMP complex. The bond must be formed between an enzyme nucleophile and the phosphorus atom of AMP, thereby releasing one water molecule, which has to be subtracted in the mass calculation. In order to determine the reactivity of the enzyme with the reaction product ADP and with other NDPs, we carried out arsenolysis experiments. Na2HAsO4 is a phosphate analogue that should be able to react with the putative enzyme-AMP intermediate. The resulting phosphate-arsenate anhydride is chemically instable and immediately hydrolyzes to AMP and arsenate. This AMP formation can be detected by thin layer chromatography. In a control experiment APS rapidly underwent arsenolysis, indicating the functionality of the assay system (Fig. 4). To our surprise, no reaction could be observed with ADP (Fig. 4). Other NDPs (GDP, UDP, CDP, and IDP) also did not react (data not shown). Even after 24 h of incubation arsenolysis was not detectable, although the enzyme still was active (tested by arsenolysis of APS). Obviously the enzyme-AMP complex cannot be formed from NDP substrates with significant rates. Although a back reaction should be possible in any enzyme-catalyzed reaction, its rate must be infinitely slow in the case of APAT so that the catalysis can be regarded as unidirectional. Therefore the former name “ADP-sulfurylase” is misleading and should not be used any longer. Although an enzyme-AMP intermediate formation with ADP as a substrate was not detectable, ADP inhibited the reaction with APS. By thin layer chromatographic analysis, we found that half-maximum inhibition in assays containing 5 mm Pi and 400 μm APS was reached at 5–10 mm ADP. Traces of AMP were present in the ADP inhibition assays (commercially available ADP had to be used without further purification to reach the concentrations required for inhibition). AMP alone has a comparatively low effect on enzyme activity (21.Schug A. Enrichment and Characterization of the ADP Sulfurylase from Thiobacillus dentrificans RT..in: Diploma thesis. University of Bonn, Germany1979Google Scholar). Sulfate inhibits APS phosphorolysis at higher concentrations. Half-maximum inhibition in assays containing 5 mm Pi and 400 μm APS was observed at 100 mm sulfate. The first half-reaction, the formation of an enzyme-AMP intermediate by reaction with APS, could in principle be reversible. Therefore we used the sulfate analogue molybdate instead of phosphate and examined molybdolysis with APS. Since the generated AMP-molybdate anhydride is unstable, the product rapidly hydrolyses into AMP and molybdate, and therefore the reaction product is taken out of the equilibrium continuously. No molybdolysis was observed. This can be taken as evidence against the possibility of a reaction of sulfate with the enzyme-AMP intermediate. To detect residues essential for catalysis, we carried out modification experiments with agents specific for cysteine, histidine, and arginine. The histidine-specific agent DEPC (2.5 mm) resulted in a rapid and complete loss of enzyme activity. Addition of APS slowed down the inactivation kinetics and protected the enzyme from complete inactivation (Fig.5 A). However, some decrease in activity was observed even when the enzyme was protected by bound substrate. The reason may be that DEPC slowly modifies additional unprotected histidines that are required for full activity. Another possibility is that the enzyme-AMP complex is not completely stable, and therefore DEPC slowly modifies even protected enzyme. This slow inactivation of the protected enzyme may be incomplete because DEPC is unstable in long term modifications. This could explain the nonlinear inactivation kinetics of APS-protected APAT as observed in the semilogarithmic plot (Fig. 5 A). Whatever the reason for the slow decrease of activity, it is obvious that substrate binding protects the enzyme from rapid inactivation. Therefore it is most likely that at least one histidine essential for catalytic activity is present in the catalytic center. Incubation with the cysteine-specific agents 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (4 mm) or iodoacetamide (10 mm) had no significant effect on activity. We conclude that accessible cysteine residues with a catalytic function do not exist in APAT. Arginines were modified using phenylglyoxal (10 mm) or diacetyl (10 mm). Phenylglyoxal resulted in an incomplete inactivation to 55% residual activity which then remained completely stable. Diacetyl inactivated the enzyme slowly but completely (Fig. 5 B). Since diacetyl is even more specific for arginine residues than phenylglyoxal, the inactivation indicates an essential role of arginine(s) for APAT. A slight decrease of activity was observed in borate buffer without modifying agent (Fig. 5 B). APAT activity was not affected by any other buffer used. The inactivation by diacetyl was slowed down by substrate binding (200 μm APS). The substrate binding effect was much weaker in the case of diacetyl modification compared with DEPC modification (Fig. 5). Since phenylglyoxal results in 55% residual activity, this comparatively bulky agent modifies less residues than diacetyl. It can be concluded that either arginines are involved in substrate binding or they are crucial for enzyme structure. If accessible and structurally essential arginines are located outside the catalytic site, substrate binding must induce conformational changes of the enzyme that cause slower modification kinetics. The determination of a sequence of 20 N-terminal amino acids allowed cloning and sequencing of the gene coding for APAT (apt) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A good matching ribosomal binding site (AAGGAG) was identified in a six-nucleotide distance from the translational start codon. 281 C-terminal codons of an open reading frame were identified upstream of apt, which code for a protein with very high homology to the E. coli Ras-like protein (Era, BLAST PE value, 2 × 10−79, release 2.0.6, see Ref. 22.Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59759) Google Scholar). Era is an essential G-protein that probably is involved in regulation of growth (23.March P.E. Lerner C.G. Ahnn J. Cui X. Inouye M. Oncogene. 1988; 2: 539-544PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Lin Y.P. Sharer J.D. March P.E. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 44-49Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The distance between era andapt (775 base pairs) and the existence of several AT-rich stretches in this region strongly suggest that apt andera transcription are not coupled. Various putative promoters are found upstream of apt. Therefore detailed genetic analyses are necessary to identify the functional promoter region. Downstream of apt a Rho-independent termination signal could not be identified in the remaining sequence of the cloned fragment (238 base pairs). It therefore cannot yet be excluded that downstream genes are transcriptionally coupled with apt. Further genetic analysis is in progress. Apt codes for a 41,387-Da protein of 370 residues (without the N-terminal methionine, which is cleaved off). This mass is in agreement with SDS-PAGE and MALDI results (see above). The calculated isoelectric point of the protein is at pH 6.0 (ProtParam, ExPASy home page). Available gene banks were screened for proteins with similarity to APAT (BLAST P, release 2.0.7). The sequence of APAT shows high homology to galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferases (GPUT, EC 2.7.7.12) from bacteria, archaea, fungi, plants, and animals (best E value: 3 × 10−27 for Thermotoga neapolitana,E value for E. coli-GPUT: 5 × 10−15). GPUT catalyzes the UMP transfer from UDP-glucose to galactose 1-phosphate. Lower homology exists to all known Ap4A phosphorylases (EC 2.7.7.-) that catalyze the NMP transfer from bis(5′-nucleosidyl)tetraphosphate dinucleotides to phosphate (see Ref. 25.Plateau P. Fromant M. Schmitter J.-M. Blanquet S. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6892-6899Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; best E value, 0.32 forSaccharomyces cerevisiae Ap4A phosphorylase 1). All three related enzymes have in common catalysis of NMP transfers to phosphate groups. Catalysis by Ap4A phosphorylase is not very specific; the yeast enzyme reversibly catalyzes phosphorolysis of various dinucleotides and in unphysiological reactions also a β-phosphate exchange of NDPs, the arsenolysis of NDPs, and very interestingly the arsenolysis and phosphorolysis of APS (25.Plateau P. Fromant M. Schmitter J.-M. Blanquet S. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6892-6899Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Guranowski A. Blanquet S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5943-5946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For that reason we tested the ability of APAT to catalyze reactions with Ap4A. No catalysis was found with 10 mmAp4A neither in a phosphorolysis nor in a hydrolysis reaction. Addition of divalent cations (1 mmMgCl2 or CaCl2, 1 μm of CoCl2, CuCl2, FeCl2, MnCl2, NiCl2, or ZnCl2) did not result in any qualitatively detectable reactivity. We also tested the reacti"

The top3cDNA encodes an 875-amino acid protein, which is nearly 60% identical to mammalian topoisomerase IIIβ enzymes. Similarity between the Drosophila protein and the topoisomerase IIIβs is particularly striking in the carboxyl-terminal region, where all contain eight highly conserved CXXC motifs not found in other topoisomerase III enzymes. We therefore propose theDrosophila protein is a member of the β-subfamily of topoisomerase III enzymes. The top3β gene is a single-copy gene located at 5 E-F on the X chromosome. P-element insertion into the 5′-untranslated region of this gene affects topoisomerase IIIβ protein levels, but not the overall fertility and viability of the fly. We purified topoisomerase IIIβ to near homogeneity and observed relaxation activity only with a hypernegatively supercoiled substrate, but not with plasmid DNA directly isolated from bacterial cells. Despite this difference in substrate preference, the degree of relaxation of the hypernegatively supercoiled substrate is comparable to relaxation of plasmid DNA by other type I enzymes. Drosophila topoisomerase IIIβ forms a covalent linkage to 5′ DNA phosphoryl groups, and the DNA cleavage reaction prefers single-stranded substrate over double-stranded, suggesting an affinity of this enzyme for DNA with non-double-helical structure."

Aβ is produced in the course of normal cellular metabolism of the β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) (1.Octave J.N. Rev. Neurosci. 1995; 6: 287-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A portion of APP is cleaved by α-secretase within the Aβ region. This non-amyloidogenic pathway, which precludes the formation of full-length Aβ, occurs during the processing of APP to the plasma membrane. This cleavage releases the soluble N-terminal domain of APP containing the first 17 amino acids of Aβ. Another fraction of newly synthesized APP appears at the plasma membrane. Following endocytosis of this transmembrane APP, the cleavage by β-secretase at the N terminus of Aβ generates a C-terminal fragment of APP that contains the entire Aβ sequence. The final step in the generation of Aβ is an apparently intramembranous cleavage of this C-terminal fragment by γ-secretase. The most common causes of familial Alzheimer's disease are mutations in genes encoding presenilins (PS) 1 and 2. These mutations alter APP processing and cause increased production of the high amyloidogenic Aβ 42 (2.Hardy J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2095-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Moreover, PS1-deficient mice show decreased γ-secretase processing of APP (3.De Strooper B. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Vanderstichele H. Guhde G. Annaert W. Von Figura K. Van Leuven F. Nature. 1998; 391: 387-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (1551) Google Scholar). PS are hydrophobic proteins that cross 6–8 times the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum. A limited portion of PS undergoes endoproteolysis, and the resulting N- and C-terminal fragments are localized predominantly in the Golgi (4.Xia W. Zhang J. Ostaszewski N.L. Kimberly W.T. Seubert P. Koo E.H. Shen J. Selkoe D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16465-16471Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Presenilins are homologous to proteins involved in vesicle transport or in the Notch developmental pathway in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans(5.Levitan D. Greenwald I. Nature. 1995; 377: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar), and PS1-deficient mice show developmental abnormalities consistent with altered Notch signaling (6.Shen J. Bronson R.T.

Nature. 1998; 393: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar). The recent demonstration that PS1 deficiency reduces the proteolytic release of the Notch intracellular domain indicates that PS1 regulates both APP processing and Notch signaling by influencing protein cleavage events (8.Wolfe M.S.

Because PS1 is required for both the release of the intracellular domain of Notch and the γ-secretase cleavage of APP, it has been proposed that PS1 acts by facilitating the activity of the protease involved or is the protease itself. Mutagenesis of two aspartate residues completely abolishes PS1 endoproteolysis and γ-secretase activity, suggesting that PS1 could be an autoactivated membranous aspartyl protease (8.Wolfe M.S.

To study whether PS1 indeed displays a γ-secretase activity, human APP 695 and PS1 were coexpressed in Sf9 cells using recombinant baculoviruses. The insect cells have been demonstrated to transport human APP at the cell surface in the correct transmembrane orientation (13.Currie J.R. Ramakrishna N. Burrage T.G. Hwang M.C. Potempska A. Miller D.L. Mehta P.D. Kim K.S. Wisniewski H.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1991; 30: 687-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Moreover, human APP expressed by insect cells is cleaved by an α-secretase activity generating a C-terminal fragment of APP identical to that produced in mammalian cells (14.Ramabhadran T.V. Gandy S.E. Ghiso J. Czernik A.J. Ferris D. Bhasin R. Goldgaber D. Frangione B. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2009-2012Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, Sf9 cells are unable to produce Aβ, although they accumulate intracellular C-terminal fragments of APP that contain the full-length Aβ sequence (15.Essalmani R. Guillaume J.M. Mercken L. Octave J.N. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 157-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Here, we show that PS1 expressed in Sf9 cells undergoes endoproteolysis and interacts with APP. However, this interaction does not result in the γ-secretase cleavage of APP. We also demonstrate that, in CHO cells, PS1 allows the secretion of Aβ without endocytosis of APP. The cDNA encoding human APP 695 or human PS1 was cloned in the pACL29 vector. Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 insect cells were cotransfected with 1 μg of linear Autographa california viral DNA and 5 μg of the recombinant plasmid as previously described (15.Essalmani R. Guillaume J.M. Mercken L. Octave J.N. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 157-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Recombinant viruses were harvested 5 days post-transfection, purified, and titered as described (15.Essalmani R. Guillaume J.M. Mercken L. Octave J.N.

Sf9 cell cultures and infections were subsequently carried out in IPL41 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The WO2 monoclonal antibody has been described (16.Ida N. Hartmann T. Pantel J. Schroder J. Zerfass R. Forstl H. Sandbrink R. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. J. Biol.

Immunoblots were developed with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The CHO cell lines expressing human APP 695 or APPΔC have been characterized (19.Essalmani R. Macq A.F. Mercken L. Octave J.N. Biochim. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). These cells were stably transfected with the cDNA encoding wild type PS1, together with a second plasmid containing the hygromycin resistance gene in a 10/1 ratio. Cells coexpressing PS1 and APP were maintained in culture in the presence of 250 μg/ml each of G418 and hygromycin. The amount of APP at the plasma membrane was quantified by the specific binding of125I-radiolabeled antibody raised to the extracellular domain of APP (19.Essalmani R. Macq A.F. Mercken L. Octave J.N. Biochim. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This specific binding was completely removed by acidic (pH 2.5) washes of the cells at 0 °C. The radioactivity internalized following a 15-min reincubation at 37 °C was resistant to these acidic washes, and the internalization was expressed as a percentage of the specific binding. Aβ was immunoprecipitated and quantified as described previously (20.Macq A.F. Czech C. Essalamni R. Brion J.P. Maron A. Mercken L. Pradier L. Octave J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28931-28936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The quantity of soluble Aβ was normalized for total APP in each cell line. Sf9 cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 10 with a human APP 695 recombinant baculovirus. Under these experimental conditions, we previously demonstrated that, by 48 h post-infection, virtually all cells become infected and express APP at the maximal level (15.Essalmani R. Guillaume J.M. Mercken L. Octave J.N. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 157-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Following expression of human APP, the C-terminal fragments were analyzed by Western blot using the WO2 monoclonal antibody (16.Ida N. Hartmann T. Pantel J. Schroder J. Zerfass R. Forstl H.

Chem. 1996; 271: 22908-22914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar), which recognizes the Aβ 5–8-amino acid sequence (Fig. 1 a). In addition to APP, the WO2 antibody detected several C-terminal fragments (from ≈15–30 kDa, Fig. 1 b). The same C-terminal fragments were recognized by the Jonas monoclonal antibody raised against the APP 643–695-amino acid sequence (Fig. 1 a). However, an additional ≈10 kDa C-terminal fragment was detected, which does not contain the Aβ 5–8 sequence (Fig. 1 b). This C-terminal fragment has been previously demonstrated to start at the α-cleavage site of APP (14.Ramabhadran T.V. Gandy S.E. Ghiso J. Czernik A.J. Ferris D. Bhasin R. Goldgaber D. Frangione B. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2009-2012Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is a substrate of γ-secretase (21.Haas C. Hung AY Scholssmacher M.G. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3021-3024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PS1 was coexpressed with APP using an additional recombinant baculovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 10. Using the MAB1563 monoclonal antibody raised against the 21–80 N-terminal residues of human PS1, holoproteins together with N-terminal fragments and aggregates were detected in Sf9 cells (Fig. 1 c), clearly indicating that part of PS1 undergoes endoproteolysis in insect cells. The formation of stable complexes between PS1 and APP in intact living cells has been demonstrated previously by precipitating these complexes with anti-PS1 and anti-APP antibodies (17.Xia W. Zhang J. Perez R. Koo E.H. Selkoe D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8208-8213Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Sf9 cells expressing human APP 695 were infected by a wild type baculovirus or the recombinant baculovirus encoding human PS1. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with the anti-PS1 polyclonal serum B14(18) or a preimmune rabbit serum, and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed in Western blot using the WO2 anti-APP monoclonal antibody. APP was specifically detected in the immunoprecipitate of Sf9 cells expressing both human APP and PS1, and a preimmune serum was not able to precipitate PS-APP complexes (Fig. 1 d). Expression of PS1 did not modify the electrophoretic profile of the APP C-terminal fragments detected by the WO2 or the Jonas antibody (Fig.1 b), indicating that coexpression of APP and PS1 does not result in the production of additional C-terminal fragments generated by γ-secretase-mediated processing of APP. Because PS1 does not cleave APP in Sf9 cells, we investigated the role of PS1 in the cellular trafficking of APP. In CHO cells, endocytosis of transmembrane APP has been demonstrated to be required for Aβ secretion (19.Essalmani R. Macq A.F. Mercken L. Octave J.N. Biochim. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 22.Haass C. Lemere C.A. Capell A. Citron M. Seubert P. Schenk D. Lannfelt L. Selkoe D.J. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 1291-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). In the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain, APP contains a tetrapeptide motif, Tyr-Glu-Asn-Pro, which is the endocytic signal of the protein (23.Perez R.G. Soriano S. Hayes J.D. Ostaszewski B. Xia W. Selkoe D.J. Chen X. Stokin G.B. Koo E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18851-18856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Deletion of this signal was performed by introducing a stop codon after Tyr-653 of APP 695, generating APPΔC. Although 56% of APP was endocytosed by CHO cells during a 15-min incubation at 37 °C, only 1.4% of APPΔC was internalized during the same period of incubation (Fig.2 a). In agreement with our previous study (19.Essalmani R. Macq A.F. Mercken L. Octave J.N. Biochim. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), this reduction of APP endocytosis was concomitant with inhibition of Aβ secretion (Fig. 2 b). Stable CHO cell lines expressing human APP and PS1 were established. Both PS1 holoprotein and N-terminal fragments were detected in the cellular extract by the MAB1563 monoclonal antibody (Fig.3 b), and the WO2 monoclonal antibody recognized human APP in both cellular extracts and culture medium (Fig. 3 a). Coexpression of APP and PS1 in CHO cells does not significantly increase the total Aβ secretion (Fig. 3,c and d). Stable CHO cell lines expressing human APPΔC and PS1 were also established. Both full-length PS1 and N-terminal fragments were detected in cellular extracts (Fig.4 b), and soluble APP was detected in the culture medium (Fig. 4 a). As previously observed (19.Essalmani R. Macq A.F. Mercken L. Octave J.N. Biochim. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), expression of APPΔC did not induce any secretion of extracellular Aβ. However, when PS1 was produced in CHO cells expressing APPΔC, a significant Aβ secretion was measured (Fig. 4,c and d). This Aβ production did not result from APPΔC internalization, because PS1 did not induce endocytosis of APPΔC (Fig. 2 a). Although this extracellular Aβ production was lower than that measured in CHO cells expressing the full-length APP, these results clearly demonstrate that PS1 allows secretion of Aβ without endocytosis of APP by CHO cells.Figure 3Processing of APP and PS1 in CHO cells. a, culture media of CHO cells (7.5% SDS-PAGE, 10 μl) were analyzed in Western blot using the WO2 monoclonal antibody.b, CHO cellular extracts (12% SDS-PAGE, 15 μg/lane) were analyzed in Western blots using the MAB1563 monoclonal antibody specific for human PS1 21–82.

The recent cloning of the β-site APP-cleaving enzyme (BACE) cDNA indicates that it encodes a protein with all the properties of a β-secretase (24.Vassar R. Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Kahn S. Mendiaz E.A. Denis P. Teplow D.B. Ross S. Amarante P. Loeloff R. Luo Y. Fisher S. Fuller J. Edenson S. Lile J. Jarosinski M.A. Biere A.L. Curran E. Burgess T. Louis J.C. Collins F. Treanor J. Rogers G. Citron M. Science. 1999; 286: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (3307) Google Scholar). As for the γ-secretase, the second enzyme needed to release Aβ from APP, it has been suggested that PS1 may in fact be that enzyme (8.Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1691) Google Scholar, 12.Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Moore C.L. Leatherwood D.D. Ostaszewski B. Rahmati T. Donkor I.O. Selkoe D.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4720-4727Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). However, PS1 may also help in the transport of APP or the secretases to the cell site where APP cleavage occurs (25.Hardy J. Israel A. Nature. 1999; 398: 466-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To address this question, APP and PS1 were coexpressed in Sf9 cells. In Sf9 cells, human PS1 is found as a holoprotein together with N-terminal fragments. We conclude, therefore, that PS1 undergoes endoproteolysis in insect cells. This endoproteolysis is important for PS1 activity, because PS1 holoprotein is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, whereas Golgi-type vesicles are known to contain principally the endoproteolytic fragments of PS1 that are thought to be the biologically active form (4.Xia W. Zhang J. Ostaszewski N.L. Kimberly W.T. Seubert P. Koo E.H. Shen J. Selkoe D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16465-16471Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 26.Zhang J. Kang D.E. Xia W. Okochi M.

In Sf9 cells expressing human APP, several C-terminal fragments accumulate and contain the full-length Aβ sequence. The length of these fragments suggests that they are not cleaved by β-secretase. An additional C-terminal fragment is generated by α-secretase, as demonstrated by its N-terminal sequence (14.Ramabhadran T.V. Gandy S.E. Ghiso J. Czernik A.J. Ferris D. Bhasin R. Goldgaber D. Frangione B. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2009-2012Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and is a substrate for γ-secretase (21.Haas C. Hung AY Scholssmacher M.G. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3021-3024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In Sf9 cells expressing both human APP and PS1, a polyclonal anti-PS1 serum was able to precipitate PS1-APP complexes. A polyclonal anti-APP serum also immunoprecipitated APP-PS1 complexes (not shown), but a preimmune serum did not. These results indicate that PS1 interacts with APP in insect cells. However, this physical interaction does not result in the cleavage of APP at the γ-secretase cleavage site, suggesting that PS1 does not have a γ-secretase activity. Our results are more consistent with a more direct role for PS1 in the cellular trafficking of APP. In CHO cells, an APP protein lacking the C-terminal domain is not endocytosed and is not transformed into Aβ. The C-terminal domain of APP is dispensable for the interaction of the protein with PS1(17), and we demonstrate here that this interaction allows the production of Aβ without endocytosis of the transmembrane APP. In CHO cells, this PS1-mediated amyloidogenic catabolic pathway of APP produces 10 times less Aβ as compared with the endocytosis-mediated amyloidogenic catabolic pathway. However, the contribution of PS1 in the production of Aβ without the endocytosis of APP could be much more important in other cell types. In the brain, PS1 shows a neuronal distribution (27.Kovacs D.M. Fausett H.J. Page K.J. Kim T.W. Moir R.D. Merriam D.E. Hollister R.D. Hallmark O.G. Mancini R. Felsenstein K.M. Hyman B.T. Tanzi R.E.

S. cerevisiaeDna2p (ScDna2p) is a DNA helicase and also a nuclease. We have cloned and sequenced the homologous gene from Xenopus(Xenopus Dna2). Xenopus Dna2p (XDna2p) is 32% identical to ScDna2p, and the similarity extends over the entire length, including but not limited to the five conserved helicase motifs. XDna2p is even more closely related (60% identical) to a partial human cDNA. The Xenopus Dna2 (XDna2) gene was able to complement an S. cerevisiae dna2–1 mutant strain for growth at the nonpermissive temperature, suggesting that XDna2p is a functional as well as a structural homolog of the yeast protein. Recombinant XDna2p was expressed in insect cells and purified. Like the ScDna2p purified from yeast, it is a single-stranded DNA endonuclease and a DNA-dependent ATPase, suggesting that both of these activities are part of the essential function of Dna2p. However, unlike ScDna2p from yeast, recombinant XDna2p showed no DNA helicase activity. When XDna2 was immunodepleted from interphase egg extracts, chromosomal DNA replication was almost completely inhibited. From the size of the residually synthesized DNA from the XDna2-depleted egg extracts, it seems that initiation of DNA replication may be impaired.

Baker T.A. DNA Replication. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1992Google Scholar). Identification of additional proteins involved in chromosomal DNA replication in eukaryotes should afford further insight into these processes. The DNA2 gene fromSaccharomyces cerevisiae(ScDNA2)1 is essential for viability. ScDNA2 encodes a protein of 170 kDa with characteristic DNA helicase motifs. Highly purified ScDna2p isolated from S. cerevisiae has intrinsic DNA-dependent ATPase and 3′ to 5′ DNA helicase activity specific for forked substrates. A single-stranded DNA endonuclease activity also copurifies with ScDna2p from yeast (2.Budd M.E. Campbell J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7642-7646Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 3.Budd M.E. Choe W.-c. Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26766-26769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Purification of recombinant ScDna2p from insect cells demonstrated that the single-stranded DNA endonuclease activity was intrinsic to ScDna2p; and, furthermore, an additional comparatively minor nuclease that was ATP-dependent and specific for double-stranded DNA was found in the highly purified preparations (4.Bae S.-H. Choi E. Lee K.-H Park J.S. Lee S.-H. Seo Y.-S J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26880-26890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Curiously, although the recombinant ScDna2p purified from insect cells had DNA-dependent ATPase, it did not show the helicase activity found in ScDna2p purified from S. cerevisiae. This discrepancy may indicate that either posttranslational modification or other protein(s) are required for the helicase activity of ScDna2p (4.Bae S.-H. Choi E. Lee K.-H Park J.S. Lee S.-H. Seo Y.-S J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26880-26890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar).Several lines of evidence point to a role for the Dna2p in DNA replication. Under restrictive conditions, temperature-sensitive Scdna2-1 mutants do not synthesize full-length chromosome-sized DNA and arrest in the cell cycle with a dumbbell-shaped morphology in a Mec1-dependent manner. Permeabilized cells and yeast nuclear extracts capable of semiconservatively replicating supercoiled plasmids have a reduced replication efficiency in the absence of ScDna2p (6.Braguglia D. Heun P. Pasero P. Duncker B.P. Gasser S.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 631-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 7.Kuo C.-L. Huang C.-H. Campbell J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6465-6469Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). TheSchizosaccharomyces pombe DNA2 gene has also been identified and is essential for growth. In high copy number, the S. pombe DNA2 gene suppresses the defect in the essential function ofcdc24. Although the specific role of Cdc24p is unknown,CDC24 is an essential gene implicated in DNA replication, since mutants arrest in G2 with rapid loss of viability and chromosomal breakage at the nonpermissive temperature (8.Gould K.L. Burns C.G. Feoktistiva A. Hu C. Pasion S.G. Forsburg S.L. Genetics. 1998; 149: 1221-1233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the function of Dna2p may also be conserved in other species.But what does Dna2p do during DNA replication? Clues may be offered by the genes and gene products with which ScDNA2 interacts. Human Fen1 protein is a nuclease required for the processing of Okazaki fragments in the Simian virus 40 in vitro replication system (9.Ishimi Y. Claude A. Bullock P. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19723-19733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Li X.Y. Li J. Harrington J. Lieber M.R. Burgers P.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22109-22112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 11.Waga S. Bauer G. Stillman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10923-10934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Genetic evidence suggests that ScDna2p and ScFen1p either interact or have partially overlapping functions. First, overproduction of ScFen1p, encoded by RAD27, suppresses the temperature-sensitive growth of a dna2-1 mutant, and similarly overproduction of ScDna2p suppresses the temperature-sensitive growth of a rad27Δ mutant. Second,dna2-1 and rad27Δ alleles are synthetically lethal. Third, certain rad27 mutants require overproduction of the G1 cyclins for growth, and overproduction of ScDna2p suppresses this requirement (12.Vallen E.A. Cross F.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4291-4302Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Since ScDna2p has a nuclease activity similar to ScFen1p, it is possible that they can serve the same function in replication, accounting for the genetic observations. However, ScDna2p and ScFen1p also coimmunoprecipitate (13.Budd M.E. Campbell J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2136-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Thus, they may actually have independent functions in a similar stage of replication, in which case the genetic data could be explained by their existing in a complex that is stable only in the presence of both proteins. Regardless of the molecular details, theDNA2/RAD27 interactions suggest that one possible role for ScDna2p lies in Okazaki fragment metabolism, and ScDna2p collaborates with or substitutes for ScFen1 in the processing of Okazaki fragments. This point of view was further suggested by the data from a recent paper in which it was shown that both overexpression of ScDna2 and deletion of ScFen1 yielded single-stranded DNA regions on telomeric DNA, and the accumulated single-stranded DNA was the templating strand for lagging-strand synthesis (14.Parenteau J. Wellinger R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4143-4152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).ScDNA2 was found to genetically interact withPOL1 and CTF4, which encode a DNA polymerase subunit and an associated protein (15.Formosa T. Nitiss T. Genetics. 1999; 151: 1459-1470Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Miles J. Formosa T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5274-5735Crossref Google Scholar, 17.Miles J. Formosa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1276-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). ScDna2p purified fromS. cerevisiae contains Ctf4p. 2M. E. Budd and J. L. Campbell, unpublished results. 2M. E. Budd and J. L. Campbell, unpublished results. Therefore, it seems possible that ScDna2p somehow interacts with DNA polymerase α, the DNA polymerase involved in the initiation of DNA synthesis both at origins of replication and at the site of each new Okazaki fragment. Recent, unpublished yeast studies also suggest a role forDNA2 in the early events in S phase. dna2-1 andmcm10 are synthetically lethal in yeast. 3A. Sugino, personal communication. 3A. Sugino, personal communication. Mcm10 is thought to be involved in initiation (18.Merchant A.M. Kawasaki Y. Chen Y. Lei M. Tye B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3261-3271Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Mutation of mcm10 suppresses mutations in the better known mcm2–7genes. 4B. K. Tye, personal communication. 4B. K. Tye, personal communication. A role for Dna2 in a late stage of DNA replication is favored, however, since despite the fact that dna2 mutants fail to synthesize high molecular weight DNA at the restrictive temperature, dna2 mutant haploid strains arrest with an apparent 2C DNA content (3.Budd M.E. Choe W.-c. Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26766-26769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 5.Fiorentino D.F. Crabtree G.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2519-2537Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).In order to establish the stage of replication in which Dna2p participates, we wanted to take advantage of the well establishedin vitro DNA replication system from Xenopus. In order to do so, we have isolated the Xenopus homolog (XDna2) of ScDNA2, whose characterization we report here. The XDna2 gene is probably a functional homolog of ScDNA2, since XDna2 efficiently complements an Scdna2 mutant for growth at the nonpermissive temperature. Like ScDna2p purified from insect cells, purified recombinant XDna2p has DNA-dependent ATPase and single-stranded DNA-specific endonuclease but no detectable DNA helicase activity. Furthermore, chromosomal DNA replication was almost completely inhibited in XDna2-depleted interphase egg extracts.DISCUSSIONUsing a degenerate PCR probe, we cloned XDna2 from aXenopus oocyte cDNA library. XDna2 encodes a protein of 1053 amino acids. We believe that XDna2 is a true homolog ofScDNA2, based on the following observations: 1) the deduced amino acid sequence of XDna2p was 32% identical to ScDna2p, and conserved motifs are located throughout the N-terminal domain in addition to the C-terminal helicase domain; 2) the XDna2 gene could efficiently complement Scdna2-1 mutants for growth at the nonpermissive temperature; 3) the recombinant XDna2p has both the DNA-dependent ATPase and single-stranded DNA endonuclease activities associated with ScDna2p; and 4) depletion of XDna2 from egg extracts inhibits replication of sperm chromatin. The presence of homologous sequences from human, C. elegans, andArabidopsis in the data base indicate that ScDna2p is evolutionarily conserved and suggest that the Dna2 protein must play a very important role in eukaryotic DNA metabolism. With the C. elegans sequence virtually complete, it is also interesting to point out that CDna2p is not similar to any other protein in the worm genome and thus serves a unique function.While the similarities are striking, there are also differences between XDna2p and ScDna2p. Most obvious is the absence of helicase activity on forked substrates. This may not be a real difference, however, since recombinant ScDna2p purified from insect cells also lacked helicase activity (4.Bae S.-H. Choi E. Lee K.-H Park J.S. Lee S.-H. Seo Y.-S J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26880-26890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Only the ScDna2p actually purified from yeast was active as a helicase (2.Budd M.E. Campbell J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7642-7646Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). It may be that the recombinant XDna2p was not correctly folded, assembled into oligomeric form, or posttranslationally modified. It is also possible that the binding of another unknown factor is important for its helicase activity (2.Budd M.E. Campbell J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7642-7646Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 3.Budd M.E. Choe W.-c. Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26766-26769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 4.Bae S.-H. Choi E. Lee K.-H Park J.S. Lee S.-H. Seo Y.-S J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26880-26890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). A second difference is that the weak ATP-dependent nuclease activity of recombinant ScDna2p was not detected in recombinant XDna2p. Since the specific ATPase activity of XDna2p was only 0.01 pmol/min/ng, 500-fold less than ScDna2p, the activity may be very difficult to detect. A third difference is that ScDna2p (1522 amino acids) has 468 amino acids at its N terminus that are not found at all in the XDna2 open reading frame. Much of this region in ScDna2p, 405 amino acids, can be deleted without reducing any of the biochemical activities of wild-type ScDna2p (4.Bae S.-H. Choi E. Lee K.-H Park J.S. Lee S.-H. Seo Y.-S J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26880-26890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and it is possible that more amino acids can be deleted from the N terminus without abolishing activities of ScDna2p. It is not known if the truncated form can support growth, however. This domain is also absent from the Arabidopsis and C. elegans cDNAs. The function of the unique N-terminal domain of ScDna2p is currently unknown.Copurification of ScDna2p with a nuclease activity led to the proposal that Dna2p itself might be a nuclease as well as a helicase (2.Budd M.E. Campbell J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7642-7646Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 3.Budd M.E. Choe W.-c. Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26766-26769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 4.Bae S.-H. Choi E. Lee K.-H Park J.S. Lee S.-H. Seo Y.-S J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26880-26890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). While it could be shown that the structure-specific nuclease Fen1p copurified with the ScDna2p from yeast, the single-stranded nuclease activity remained in a strain carrying a rad27Δ, indicating that at least one additional nuclease was present (13.Budd M.E. Campbell J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2136-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). It now appears that the second activity is intrinsic to Dna2p, since it is present in highly purified recombinant ScDna2p from insect cells. Also, like the yeast enzyme, XDna2p was shown here to be a single-stranded DNA-specific endonuclease that yielded short oligonucleotides as products rather than a structure-specific nuclease. Several known helicases (yeast SGS1, the Werner syndrome helicase, and the bacterial RecB,C,D enzyme) are associated with nuclease activities, although none of the known helicase/nuclease proteins has been shown, like Dna2p, to be involved in DNA replication. Like ScDna2, XDna2 falls in the RecB family of helicase nucleases based on primary structure comparison (28.Aravind L. Walker D.R. Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1223-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar).ScDna2p is required for chromosomal DNA replication, although the exact way in which it contributes has proved elusive. Since ScDna2p and XDna2p are single-stranded DNA endonucleases, and ScDna2p and ScFen1p could reciprocally suppress the temperature-sensitive growth defect of their respective mutants (13.Budd M.E. Campbell J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2136-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), it is possible that Dna2 proteins play a role in Okazaki fragment processing like the nuclease Fen1. Most recently, it was shown that both overexpression of ScDna2 and deletion of ScFen1 yielded single-stranded DNA regions on telomeric DNA. Since the accumulated single-stranded DNA was the templating strand for lagging-strand synthesis, it was suggested that ScDna2 and ScFen1 collaborate in the processing of Okazaki fragments (14.Parenteau J. Wellinger R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4143-4152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A role for Dna2 in a late stage of DNA replication is further supported by the fact that dna2 mutant strains arrest with an apparent 2C DNA content despite the fact that dna2 mutants fail to synthesize high molecular weight DNA at the restrictive temperature (3.Budd M.E. Choe W.-c. Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26766-26769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar,5.Fiorentino D.F. Crabtree G.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2519-2537Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). ScDNA2 genetically interacts with Pol1p and Ctf4p, which encode a DNA polymerase α subunit and an associated protein (15.Formosa T. Nitiss T. Genetics. 1999; 151: 1459-1470Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Miles J. Formosa T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5274-5735Crossref Google Scholar, 17.Miles J. Formosa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1276-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). ScDna2p purified from S. cerevisiae contains Ctf4p.2 dna2-1 and mcm10 are synthetically lethal in yeast.3 Mutation ofmcm10 suppresses mutations in mcm2–7 genes and is thought to be involved in initiation (18.Merchant A.M. Kawasaki Y. Chen Y. Lei M. Tye B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3261-3271Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar).4 Therefore, it seems also possible that ScDna2p may be somehow involved in initiation of DNA replication. The almost complete inhibition of chromosomal DNA replication in XDna2-depleted interphase egg extracts reported here and the large size of the residually synthesized DNA also hint that Dna2 may play a role in a very early step in DNA replication. The 2C DNA content in the arrested yeast dna2 mutant cells may be due to leaky mutations. The recently described soluble nucleoplasmic extract system, which is capable of DNA replication on plasmid templates as well as sperm chromatin, will probably give us a clear answer about whether Dna2 is involved in the initiation, elongation, or both (29.Walter J. Sun L. Newport J. Mol. Cell. 1999; 1: 519-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (217) Google Scholar). It will be possible using plasmid templates to better analyze the stage of DNA replication that is blocked. Sincedna2 mutants of S. cerevisiae have elongated telomeres (15.Formosa T. Nitiss T. Genetics. 1999; 151: 1459-1470Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Dna2p may also be involved in telomere replication. 5W. Choe and J. L. Campbell, unpublished results., 6L. Hoopes, W. Choe, and J. L. Campbell, unpublished results.Alternatively, this may reflect interaction of the lagging-strand complex containing an altered Dna2p with telomerase.The number of proteins with helicase activity implicated in chromosomal replication is gradually increasing. It has been proposed that an MCM protein complex is the helicase for unwinding the origins for DNA replication in eukaryotic cells (30.Ishimi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24508-24513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Another helicase, FFA-1 which is the Xenopus homolog of Werner syndrome protein, was shown to be involved in forming replication foci (31.Yan H. Chen C. Kobayashi R. Newport J. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 375-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). FFA-1 is likely a nuclease too since the human homolog was proved to be a nuclease (32.Huang S. Li B. Gray M.D. Oshima J. Mian I.S. Campisi J. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 114-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). It will be very interesting to elucidate the exact roles of Dna2p, the MCMs, and FFA-1 in DNA replication using a combination of yeast genetics and the in vitro Xenopus DNA replication system.Yeast dna2 mutants, in addition to being defective in DNA replication, are sensitive to DNA-damaging agents, especially x-rays and methylmethane sulfonate. Therefore, Dna2 may have multiple functions in DNA metabolism, like the FEN1, Mre11, and Exo1 nucleases (12.Vallen E.A. Cross F.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4291-4302Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 33.Tishkoff D.X. Boerger A.L. Bertrand P. Filosi N. Gaida G.M. Kane M. Kolodner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A more detailed study of the Dna2 protein family may have clinical in addition to theoretical significance. Although the mechanism of DNA replication is very well understood in virus, phage, and bacterial systems, knowledge about how the replication of chromosomal DNA in eukaryotic cells is initiated, elongated, and terminated and how the fidelity of replication is achieved is still limited (1.Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1992Google Scholar). Identification of additional proteins involved in chromosomal DNA replication in eukaryotes should afford further insight into these processes. The DNA2 gene fromSaccharomyces cerevisiae(ScDNA2)1 is essential for viability. ScDNA2 encodes a protein of 170 kDa with characteristic DNA helicase motifs. Highly purified ScDna2p isolated from S. cerevisiae has intrinsic DNA-dependent ATPase and 3′ to 5′ DNA helicase activity specific for forked substrates. A single-stranded DNA endonuclease activity also copurifies with ScDna2p from yeast (2.Budd M.E. Campbell J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7642-7646Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 3.Budd M.E. Choe W.-c. Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26766-26769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Purification of recombinant ScDna2p from insect cells demonstrated that the single-stranded DNA endonuclease activity was intrinsic to ScDna2p; and, furthermore, an additional comparatively minor nuclease that was ATP-dependent and specific for double-stranded DNA was found in the highly purified preparations (4.Bae S.-H. Choi E. Lee K.-H Park J.S. Lee S.-H. Seo Y.-S J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26880-26890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Curiously, although the recombinant ScDna2p purified from insect cells had DNA-dependent ATPase, it did not show the helicase activity found in ScDna2p purified from S. cerevisiae. This discrepancy may indicate that either posttranslational modification or other protein(s) are required for the helicase activity of ScDna2p (4.Bae S.-H. Choi E. Lee K.-H Park J.S. Lee S.-H. Seo Y.-S J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26880-26890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence point to a role for the Dna2p in DNA replication. Under restrictive conditions, temperature-sensitive Scdna2-1 mutants do not synthesize full-length chromosome-sized DNA and arrest in the cell cycle with a dumbbell-shaped morphology in a Mec1-dependent manner. Permeabilized cells and yeast nuclear extracts capable of semiconservatively replicating supercoiled plasmids have a reduced replication efficiency in the absence of ScDna2p (6.Braguglia D. Heun P. Pasero P. Duncker B.P. Gasser S.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 631-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 7.Kuo C.-L. Huang C.-H. Campbell J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6465-6469Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). TheSchizosaccharomyces pombe DNA2 gene has also been identified and is essential for growth. In high copy number, the S. pombe DNA2 gene suppresses the defect in the essential function ofcdc24. Although the specific role of Cdc24p is unknown,CDC24 is an essential gene implicated in DNA replication, since mutants arrest in G2 with rapid loss of viability and chromosomal breakage at the nonpermissive temperature (8.Gould K.L. Burns C.G. Feoktistiva A. Hu C. Pasion S.G. Forsburg S.L. Genetics. 1998; 149: 1221-1233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the function of Dna2p may also be conserved in other species. But what does Dna2p do during DNA replication? Clues may be offered by the genes and gene products with which ScDNA2 interacts. Human Fen1 protein is a nuclease required for the processing of Okazaki fragments in the Simian virus 40 in vitro replication system (9.Ishimi Y. Claude A. Bullock P. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19723-19733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Li X.Y. Li J. Harrington J. Lieber M.R. Burgers P.M.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 10923-10934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Genetic evidence suggests that ScDna2p and ScFen1p either interact or have partially overlapping functions. First, overproduction of ScFen1p, encoded by RAD27, suppresses the temperature-sensitive growth of a dna2-1 mutant, and similarly overproduction of ScDna2p suppresses the temperature-sensitive growth of a rad27Δ mutant. Second,dna2-1 and rad27Δ alleles are synthetically lethal. Third, certain rad27 mutants require overproduction of the G1 cyclins for growth, and overproduction of ScDna2p suppresses this requirement (12.Vallen E.A. Cross F.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4291-4302Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Since ScDna2p has a nuclease activity similar to ScFen1p, it is possible that they can serve the same function in replication, accounting for the genetic observations. However, ScDna2p and ScFen1p also coimmunoprecipitate (13.Budd M.E. Campbell J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2136-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Thus, they may actually have independent functions in a similar stage of replication, in which case the genetic data could be explained by their existing in a complex that is stable only in the presence of both proteins. Regardless of the molecular details, theDNA2/RAD27 interactions suggest that one possible role for ScDna2p lies in Okazaki fragment metabolism, and ScDna2p collaborates with or substitutes for ScFen1 in the processing of Okazaki fragments.

A subgroup of these proteins, the HMGI(Y)1family, comprises diverse proteins containing short DNA-binding domains (AT-hooks; Ref. 3.Reeves R. Nissen M.S. J. Biol.

Rearrangements or impairing of the HMGI-C gene were found in a number of tumors of mesenchymal origin (9.Ashar H.R. Schoenberg Fejzo M. Tkachenko A. Zhou X. Fletcher J.A. Weremowicz S. Morton C.C.

Nature. 1995; 376: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar), respectively. These observations emphasize involvement of this protein in cell growth and development.However, although different binding sites of HMGI(Y) proteins within gene enhancers and promoters have been described, the organization of this protein-DNA complex is poorly understood. The proteins have three putative AT-hooks that interact with the minor groove of DNA (12.Solomon M.J. Strauss F. Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1276-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Two of them are necessary for strong binding to DNA (13.Claus P. Schulze E. Wiśniewski J.R. J. Biol.

Biol. 1997; 17: 3649-3662Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and the involvement of particular AT-hooks depends on the DNA conformation (16.Frank O. Schwanbeck R. Wiśniewski J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20015-20020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). NMR studies of HMGI revealed that, in the protein-DNA complex, the central portion of the AT-hook, the tripeptide RGR, penetrates the minor groove of the AT-rich stretches, whereas residues on both sides of the peptide establish extensive contacts with the sugar-phosphate backbone (17.Huth J.R. Bewley C.A. Nissen M.S. Evans J.N.S. Reeves R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 657-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). On the basis of the DNA-binding strength and extent of the contacts to the backbone, these DNA binding domains (DBD) were classified as type I DNA binding domains (I-DBD) and type II DBD with high and low binding affinity, respectively (17.Huth J.R. Bewley C.A. Nissen M.S. Evans J.N.S. Reeves R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 657-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar).The proteins of the HMGI(Y) family are phosphoproteins. They are phosphorylated by protein kinase CK2 (18.Palvimo J. Linnala-Kankkunen A. FEBS Lett. 1989; 257: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 19.Ferranti P. Malorni A. Marino G. Pucci P. Goodwin G.H. Manfioletti G. Giancotti V. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 27476-27483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In vivo the entire population of the HMGI-C protein appears to be phosphorylated (23.Giancotti V. Bandiera A. Buratti E. Fusco A. Narzari R. Coles B. Goodwin G.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 198: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This protein possesses four putative phosphorylation sites for CK2 located within its C-terminal acidic tail and two phosphorylation sites for Cdc2 kinase flanking both sides of the central AT-hook (Fig. 1 A) (24.Goodwin G. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The modification within the C-terminal region of the protein by CK2 has a constitutive character, and it appears to be important for proper conformation and function since phosphorylation by this kinase reduces the DNA-binding affinity of the HMGI protein (25.Wang D.-Z. Ray P. Boothby M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22924-22932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and increases resistance of insect HMG proteins to proteinases (26.Wiśniewski J.R. Szewczuk Z. Petry I. Schwanbeck R. Renner U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20116-20122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation by Cdc2 reduces binding strength of the mammalian and insect HMGI proteins to DNA (20.Reeves R. Langan T.A. Nissen M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We show that the N-terminally and the centrally located AT-hooks of the protein interact with the NRDI and PRDII promoter elements, respectively. The third AT-hook and the PRDIII-1 element of the 34-bp fragment do not contribute to protein-DNA interaction. Phosphorylation of the protein by Cdc2 kinase impairs a number of contacts of the central AT-hook with the PRDII element. In contrast binding of the HMGI-C protein to poly(dA-dT)·poly(dA-dT) involves all three AT-hooks and is only weakly affected by phosphorylation. The data presented allow insights in the nature of the HMGI-C protein binding to various DNAs and demonstrate how this interaction is modulated by Cdc2 kinase.DISCUSSIONResults obtained in this study allow a deeper insight to the nature of the interaction between HMGI(Y) type proteins and regulatory elements of the IFN-β gene or pure AT-DNA stretches. Our results extend the picture of the complex of the AT-hook domain with DNA that was obtained by NMR spectroscopic studies (17.Huth J.R. Bewley C.A. Nissen M.S. Evans J.N.S. Reeves R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 657-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). We provide the first description of the organization of a complex of HMGI-C, a member of the HMGI(Y) protein family, and a fragment of the promoter of the β-interferon gene, based on experiments employing the entire protein carrying posttranslational modifications, that are characteristic for its native form.Protein footprinting experiments revealed that, in the presence of unspecific AT-rich DNA, all three AT-hooks present in the protein are involved in contacts with DNA, whereas, in the presence of the promoter of the β-interferon gene, only the first two binding domains are directly involved in binding. A similar situation was described previously for the Chironomus HMGI protein (16.Frank O. Schwanbeck R. Wiśniewski J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20015-20020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar); however, the insect protein binds to the promoter of the β-interferon gene using the second and the third motif. Interestingly, in both cHMGI and HMGI-C, the distance between the centers of those AT-hooks that bind to the promoter is exactly 20 residues. In mammalian HMGI, the distances between the first and the second and the second and the third motifs are 32 and 26 residues, respectively. In this case also, the last both AT-hooks are involved in the binding to the IFN-β promoter (15.Yie J. Liang S. Merika M. Thanos D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3649-3662Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), indicating that this distance of AT-hooks is a prerequisite for interaction with DNA of this type.In the complex with the IFN-β fragment, the third AT-hook of HMGI-C is not involved in contacts with DNA. Moreover, in the complex, this region and a portion of the protein comprising residues that are N-terminally adjacent to it are strongly exposed to solvent. Therefore, this portion of protein may be responsible for protein-protein contacts in assembly of higher order complexes, as those of the enhanceosome. The propensity of AT-hooks to interact with other proteins was previously demonstrated for nuclear factor Y (NF-Y) and HMGI(Y) (44.Currie R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30880-30888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and serum-response factor (SRF) and HMGI(Y) (45.Chin M.T. Pellacani A. Wang H. Lin S.S.J. Jain M.K. Parella M.A. Lee M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9755-9760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). More recently, Yieet al. (46.Yie J. Mererika M. Munshi N. Chen G. Thanos D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3074-3089Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) have suggested that completion of the enhanceosome assembly requires interaction of DNA-bound HMGI(Y) with transcriptional activators. Thus, a HMGI(Y) protein bound to a promoter would facilitate binding of the activators through the AT-hook, which is not involved in DNA binding. Binding of proteins of the HMGI(Y) family to pure AT-tracts results in masking of all three AT-hooks (Ref.16.Frank O. Schwanbeck R. Wiśniewski J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20015-20020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, and this work) and thus probably inhibits binding to the activators. This property of the HMGI(Y) protein family appears to be important in view of their association with DNA of constitutive chromatin (6.Disney J.E. Johnson K.R. Magnuson N.S. Sylvester S.R. Reeves R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1975-1982Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 47.Strauss F. Varshavsky A. Cell. 1984; 37: 889-901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), where recruitment of transcriptional activators is not desired.DNA footprinting and methylation interference assays clearly demonstrate that HMGI-C binds to the PRDII and NRDI elements. Binding of the HMGI protein to this DNA occurs also at these elements (15.Yie J. Liang S. Merika M. Thanos D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3649-3662Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), suggesting that both proteins exhibit similar specificity and probably are able to exert similar function. The quantitative analysis of the footprinting data revealed that the sites protected in the complex match very well with the positions of the sugar-phosphate backbone that contact the central AT-hook of human HMGI (17.Huth J.R. Bewley C.A. Nissen M.S. Evans J.N.S. Reeves R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 657-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The primary structure of this AT-hook is identical in HMGI and HMGI-C. The maxima of protection correspond to positions where the AT-hook enters and exits the minor groove, e.g. in the vicinity of T17 and T21 of the upper and bottom strands, respectively. The higher intensity of protection within the upper strand of PRDII appears to reflect the higher extent of contacts between DBD 2 and the upper strand in comparison to the bottom strand (17.Huth J.R. Bewley C.A. Nissen M.S. Evans J.N.S. Reeves R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 657-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). On the basis of the intensity of protection within the NRDI element, it appears that the contacts between the protein and DNA at this site are more extensive than those observed for the PRDII element. As the binding of the first AT-hook to the promoter of the β-interferon gene appears to involve a region that flanks it C-terminally (residues 33–41), it seems that this part of HMGI-C is responsible for contacts with NRDI. A short stretch of three glutamine residues is present in the region that flanks DBD 1 C-terminally. Glutamine side chain has strong hydrogen binding potential and is often involved in contacting A and G bases within major and minor grooves, respectively. Therefore, it is possible that these residues are integral elements of this DBD. To distinguish it from the previously defined DBDs of HMGI(Y) of type I and II (17.Huth J.R. Bewley C.A. Nissen M.S. Evans J.N.S. Reeves R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 657-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), we propose to designate it DBD of type III.Activation of Cdc2 kinase during G2 phase of the cell cycle is essential for the onset of mitosis in eukaryotic cells. A number of nuclear proteins become phosphorylated by this enzyme. This includes nuclear lamins, nucleolin, histone H1, HMGI(Y), and many other proteins. During cell division HMGI(Y) proteins remain associated with condensed mitotic chromosomes (6.Disney J.E. Johnson K.R. Magnuson N.S. Sylvester S.R. Reeves R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1975-1982Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 48.Falciola L. Spada F. Calogero S. Längst G. Voit R. Grummt I. Bianchi M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) despite their mitotic phosphorylation (20.Reeves R. Langan T.A. Nissen M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1671-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 21.Nissen M.S. Langan T.A. Reeves R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19945-19952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The HMGI-C protein contains two sites that are substrates for Cdc2 kinase, Ser-43 and Ser-58. Phosphorylation at these sites results in a 4-fold reduction in the strength of binding to IFN-β promoter. Previous studies, in which the effect of phosphorylation on DNA binding by HMGI was studied, revealed that differences in binding affinity between phospho- and dephospho- forms of this protein are salt-dependent (21.Nissen M.S. Langan T.A. Reeves R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19945-19952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An increase in salt concentration weakens much more severely the binding of the Cdc2-phosphorylated protein than that of the dephosphorylated one. This suggests that the contribution of ionic interactions in the complex of the phosphorylated HMGI with DNA is higher than in the case of the complex with dephosphorylated protein. Our results demonstrated dramatic changes in the nature of the observed contacts. This includes mainly impairment of a number of contacts between the second AT-hook and the PRDII element and an apparent strengthening of binding of the first AT-hook to the NRDI element on the bottom strand (Fig. 6). The weakening of the binding of the phosphorylated protein to PRDII seems to be partially counterbalanced by additional contacts at the bottom strand of the NRDI element. The observed alterations upon modification by Cdc2 are best accommodated in the model depicted in Fig.8. It appears that phosphorylation leads to an at least partial derailing of the DBDs from the minor groove, which may result in additional ionic contacts with the sugar-phosphate backbone. In vivo, phosphorylation by Cdc2 kinase may contribute to the disassembly of promoter complexes in cells entering mitosis. Strong perturbation of the complex of HMGI-C with the β-interferon promoter upon phosphorylation of the protein by Cdc2 kinase, observed in this study by footprinting techniques, is probably accompanied by changes in the conformation of the DNA.

DBD 1 and 2 of the HMGI-C protein bind to the NRDI and PRDII elements of the IFN-β promoter, respectively. After phosphorylation of the protein at Ser-43 and Ser-58 by Cdc2 kinase multiple contacts of DBDs, especially with the bases, are impaired and the protein binds to DNA in a different way, extending the contacts to the sugar-phosphate backbone. Major changes in the complex are indicated by arrows.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) High mobility group proteins are abundant components of chromatin, which modulate DNA conformation and facilitate assembly of higher order structures (for a review, see Refs. 1.Bustin M.

A subgroup of these proteins, the HMGI(Y)1family, comprises diverse proteins containing short DNA-binding domains (AT-hooks; Ref. 3.Reeves R. Nissen M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8573-8582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and acidic C-terminal regions. They act as regulatory factors affecting indirectly the expression of genes (for a review see Ref. 4.Bustin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5237-5246Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar). High levels of the proteins were found in transcriptionally active chromatin (5.Ghidelli S. Claus P. Thies G. Wiśniewski J.R. Chromosoma. 1997; 105: 369-379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in constitutive heterochromatin of metaphase chromosomes (6.Disney J.E. Johnson K.R. Magnuson N.S. Sylvester S.R. Reeves R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1975-1982Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells three proteins of this type were detected, the HMGI, HMGY, and HMGI-C (7.Johnson K.R. Lehn D.A. Reeves R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2114-2123Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 8.Manfioletti G. Giancotti V. Bandiera A. Buratti E. Sautière P. Cary P. Crane-Robinson C. Coles B. Goodwin G.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6793-6797Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). They are abundantly expressed in embryonic, rapidly proliferating, and tumor cells. Rearrangements or impairing of the HMGI-C gene were found in a number of tumors of mesenchymal origin (9.Ashar H.R. Schoenberg Fejzo M. Tkachenko A. Zhou X. Fletcher J.A. Weremowicz S. Morton C.C.

Nature. 1995; 376: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar), respectively. These observations emphasize involvement of this protein in cell growth and development. However, although different binding sites of HMGI(Y) proteins within gene enhancers and promoters have been described, the organization of this protein-DNA complex is poorly understood. The proteins have three putative AT-hooks that interact with the minor groove of DNA (12.Solomon M.J. Strauss F. Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1276-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Two of them are necessary for strong binding to DNA (13.Claus P. Schulze E. Wiśniewski J.R. J. Biol.

Biol. 1997; 17: 3649-3662Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and the involvement of particular AT-hooks depends on the DNA conformation (16.Frank O. Schwanbeck R. Wiśniewski J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20015-20020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). NMR studies of HMGI revealed that, in the protein-DNA complex, the central portion of the AT-hook, the tripeptide RGR, penetrates the minor groove of the AT-rich stretches, whereas residues on both sides of the peptide establish extensive contacts with the sugar-phosphate backbone (17.Huth J.R. Bewley C.A. Nissen M.S. Evans J.N.S. Reeves R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 657-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). On the basis of the DNA-binding strength and extent of the contacts to the backbone, these DNA binding domains (DBD) were classified as type I DNA binding domains (I-DBD) and type II DBD with high and low binding affinity, respectively (17.Huth J.R. Bewley C.A. Nissen M.S. Evans J.N.S. Reeves R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 657-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The proteins of the HMGI(Y) family are phosphoproteins. They are phosphorylated by protein kinase CK2 (18.Palvimo J. Linnala-Kankkunen A. FEBS Lett. 1989; 257: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 19.Ferranti P. Malorni A. Marino G. Pucci P. Goodwin G.H. Manfioletti G. Giancotti V. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 27476-27483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In vivo the entire population of the HMGI-C protein appears to be phosphorylated (23.Giancotti V. Bandiera A. Buratti E. Fusco A. Narzari R. Coles B. Goodwin G.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 198: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This protein possesses four putative phosphorylation sites for CK2 located within its C-terminal acidic tail and two phosphorylation sites for Cdc2 kinase flanking both sides of the central AT-hook (Fig. 1 A) (24.Goodwin G. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The modification within the C-terminal region of the protein by CK2 has a constitutive character, and it appears to be important for proper conformation and function since phosphorylation by this kinase reduces the DNA-binding affinity of the HMGI protein (25.Wang D.-Z. Ray P. Boothby M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22924-22932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and increases resistance of insect HMG proteins to proteinases (26.Wiśniewski J.R. Szewczuk Z. Petry I. Schwanbeck R. Renner U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20116-20122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation by Cdc2 reduces binding strength of the mammalian and insect HMGI proteins to DNA (20.Reeves R. Langan T.A. Nissen M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In this work we describe the organization of the complex of the murine HMGI-C protein with a 34-bp DNA fragment of the β-interferon gene promoter. We show that the N-terminally and the centrally located AT-hooks of the protein interact with the NRDI and PRDII promoter elements, respectively. The third AT-hook and the PRDIII-1 element of the 34-bp fragment do not contribute to protein-DNA interaction. Phosphorylation of the protein by Cdc2 kinase impairs a number of contacts of the central AT-hook with the PRDII element. In contrast binding of the HMGI-C protein to poly(dA-dT)·poly(dA-dT) involves all three AT-hooks and is only weakly affected by phosphorylation. The data presented allow insights in the nature of the HMGI-C protein binding to various DNAs and demonstrate how this interaction is modulated by Cdc2 kinase. DISCUSSIONResults obtained in this study allow a deeper insight to the nature of the interaction between HMGI(Y) type proteins and regulatory elements of the IFN-β gene or pure AT-DNA stretches. Our results extend the picture of the complex of the AT-hook domain with DNA that was obtained by NMR spectroscopic studies (17.Huth J.R. Bewley C.A. Nissen M.S. Evans J.N.S. Reeves R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 657-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). We provide the first description of the organization of a complex of HMGI-C, a member of the HMGI(Y) protein family, and a fragment of the promoter of the β-interferon gene, based on experiments employing the entire protein carrying posttranslational modifications, that are characteristic for its native form.Protein footprinting experiments revealed that, in the presence of unspecific AT-rich DNA, all three AT-hooks present in the protein are involved in contacts with DNA, whereas, in the presence of the promoter of the β-interferon gene, only the first two binding domains are directly involved in binding. A similar situation was described previously for the Chironomus HMGI protein (16.Frank O. Schwanbeck R. Wiśniewski J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20015-20020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar); however, the insect protein binds to the promoter of the β-interferon gene using the second and the third motif. Interestingly, in both cHMGI and HMGI-C, the distance between the centers of those AT-hooks that bind to the promoter is exactly 20 residues. In mammalian HMGI, the distances between the first and the second and the second and the third motifs are 32 and 26 residues, respectively. In this case also, the last both AT-hooks are involved in the binding to the IFN-β promoter (15.Yie J. Liang S. Merika M. Thanos D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3649-3662Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), indicating that this distance of AT-hooks is a prerequisite for interaction with DNA of this type.In the complex with the IFN-β fragment, the third AT-hook of HMGI-C is not involved in contacts with DNA. Moreover, in the complex, this region and a portion of the protein comprising residues that are N-terminally adjacent to it are strongly exposed to solvent. Therefore, this portion of protein may be responsible for protein-protein contacts in assembly of higher order complexes, as those of the enhanceosome. The propensity of AT-hooks to interact with other proteins was previously demonstrated for nuclear factor Y (NF-Y) and HMGI(Y) (44.Currie R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30880-30888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and serum-response factor (SRF) and HMGI(Y) (45.Chin M.T. Pellacani A. Wang H. Lin S.S.J. Jain M.K. Parella M.A. Lee M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9755-9760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). More recently, Yieet al. (46.Yie J. Mererika M. Munshi N. Chen G. Thanos D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3074-3089Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) have suggested that completion of the enhanceosome assembly requires interaction of DNA-bound HMGI(Y) with transcriptional activators. Thus, a HMGI(Y) protein bound to a promoter would facilitate binding of the activators through the AT-hook, which is not involved in DNA binding. Binding of proteins of the HMGI(Y) family to pure AT-tracts results in masking of all three AT-hooks (Ref.16.Frank O. Schwanbeck R. Wiśniewski J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20015-20020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, and this work) and thus probably inhibits binding to the activators. This property of the HMGI(Y) protein family appears to be important in view of their association with DNA of constitutive chromatin (6.Disney J.E. Johnson K.R. Magnuson N.S. Sylvester S.R. Reeves R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1975-1982Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 47.Strauss F. Varshavsky A. Cell. 1984; 37: 889-901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), where recruitment of transcriptional activators is not desired.DNA footprinting and methylation interference assays clearly demonstrate that HMGI-C binds to the PRDII and NRDI elements. Binding of the HMGI protein to this DNA occurs also at these elements (15.Yie J. Liang S. Merika M. Thanos D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3649-3662Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), suggesting that both proteins exhibit similar specificity and probably are able to exert similar function. The quantitative analysis of the footprinting data revealed that the sites protected in the complex match very well with the positions of the sugar-phosphate backbone that contact the central AT-hook of human HMGI (17.Huth J.R. Bewley C.A. Nissen M.S. Evans J.N.S. Reeves R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 657-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The primary structure of this AT-hook is identical in HMGI and HMGI-C. The maxima of protection correspond to positions where the AT-hook enters and exits the minor groove, e.g. in the vicinity of T17 and T21 of the upper and bottom strands, respectively. The higher intensity of protection within the upper strand of PRDII appears to reflect the higher extent of contacts between DBD 2 and the upper strand in comparison to the bottom strand (17.Huth J.R. Bewley C.A. Nissen M.S. Evans J.N.S. Reeves R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 657-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). On the basis of the intensity of protection within the NRDI element, it appears that the contacts between the protein and DNA at this site are more extensive than those observed for the PRDII element. As the binding of the first AT-hook to the promoter of the β-interferon gene appears to involve a region that flanks it C-terminally (residues 33–41), it seems that this part of HMGI-C is responsible for contacts with NRDI. A short stretch of three glutamine residues is present in the region that flanks DBD 1 C-terminally. Glutamine side chain has strong hydrogen binding potential and is often involved in contacting A and G bases within major and minor grooves, respectively. Therefore, it is possible that these residues are integral elements of this DBD. To distinguish it from the previously defined DBDs of HMGI(Y) of type I and II (17.Huth J.R. Bewley C.A. Nissen M.S. Evans J.N.S. Reeves R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 657-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), we propose to designate it DBD of type III.Activation of Cdc2 kinase during G2 phase of the cell cycle is essential for the onset of mitosis in eukaryotic cells. A number of nuclear proteins become phosphorylated by this enzyme. This includes nuclear lamins, nucleolin, histone H1, HMGI(Y), and many other proteins. During cell division HMGI(Y) proteins remain associated with condensed mitotic chromosomes (6.Disney J.E. Johnson K.R. Magnuson N.S. Sylvester S.R. Reeves R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1975-1982Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 48.Falciola L. Spada F. Calogero S. Längst G. Voit R. Grummt I. Bianchi M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) despite their mitotic phosphorylation (20.Reeves R. Langan T.A. Nissen M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1671-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 21.Nissen M.S. Langan T.A. Reeves R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19945-19952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The HMGI-C protein contains two sites that are substrates for Cdc2 kinase, Ser-43 and Ser-58. Phosphorylation at these sites results in a 4-fold reduction in the strength of binding to IFN-β promoter. Previous studies, in which the effect of phosphorylation on DNA binding by HMGI was studied, revealed that differences in binding affinity between phospho- and dephospho- forms of this protein are salt-dependent (21.Nissen M.S. Langan T.A. Reeves R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19945-19952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An increase in salt concentration weakens much more severely the binding of the Cdc2-phosphorylated protein than that of the dephosphorylated one. This suggests that the contribution of ionic interactions in the complex of the phosphorylated HMGI with DNA is higher than in the case of the complex with dephosphorylated protein. Our results demonstrated dramatic changes in the nature of the observed contacts. This includes mainly impairment of a number of contacts between the second AT-hook and the PRDII element and an apparent strengthening of binding of the first AT-hook to the NRDI element on the bottom strand (Fig. 6). The weakening of the binding of the phosphorylated protein to PRDII seems to be partially counterbalanced by additional contacts at the bottom strand of the NRDI element. The observed alterations upon modification by Cdc2 are best accommodated in the model depicted in Fig.8. It appears that phosphorylation leads to an at least partial derailing of the DBDs from the minor groove, which may result in additional ionic contacts with the sugar-phosphate backbone. In vivo, phosphorylation by Cdc2 kinase may contribute to the disassembly of promoter complexes in cells entering mitosis. Strong perturbation of the complex of HMGI-C with the β-interferon promoter upon phosphorylation of the protein by Cdc2 kinase, observed in this study by footprinting techniques, is probably accompanied by changes in the conformation of the DNA.

Activation of Cdc2 kinase during G2 phase of the cell cycle is essential for the onset of mitosis in eukaryotic cells. A number of nuclear proteins become phosphorylated by this enzyme. This includes nuclear lamins, nucleolin, histone H1, HMGI(Y), and many other proteins. During cell division HMGI(Y) proteins remain associated with condensed mitotic chromosomes (6.Disney J.E. Johnson K.R. Magnuson N.S. Sylvester S.R. Reeves R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1975-1982Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 48.Falciola L. Spada F. Calogero S. Längst G. Voit R. Grummt I. Bianchi M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) despite their mitotic phosphorylation (20.Reeves R. Langan T.A. Nissen M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1671-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 21.Nissen M.S. Langan T.A. Reeves R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19945-19952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The HMGI-C protein contains two sites that are substrates for Cdc2 kinase, Ser-43 and Ser-58. Phosphorylation at these sites results in a 4-fold reduction in the strength of binding to IFN-β promoter. Previous studies, in which the effect of phosphorylation on DNA binding by HMGI was studied, revealed that differences in binding affinity between phospho- and dephospho- forms of this protein are salt-dependent (21.Nissen M.S. Langan T.A. Reeves R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19945-19952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An increase in salt concentration weakens much more severely the binding of the Cdc2-phosphorylated protein than that of the dephosphorylated one. This suggests that the contribution of ionic interactions in the complex of the phosphorylated HMGI with DNA is higher than in the case of the complex with dephosphorylated protein. Our results demonstrated dramatic changes in the nature of the observed contacts. This includes mainly impairment of a number of contacts between the second AT-hook and the PRDII element and an apparent strengthening of binding of the first AT-hook to the NRDI element on the bottom strand (Fig. 6). The weakening of the binding of the phosphorylated protein to PRDII seems to be partially counterbalanced by additional contacts at the bottom strand of the NRDI element. The observed alterations upon modification by Cdc2 are best accommodated in the model depicted in Fig.8. It appears that phosphorylation leads to an at least partial derailing of the DBDs from the minor groove, which may result in additional ionic contacts with the sugar-phosphate backbone. In vivo, phosphorylation by Cdc2 kinase may contribute to the disassembly of promoter complexes in cells entering mitosis. Strong perturbation of the complex of HMGI-C with the β-interferon promoter upon phosphorylation of the protein by Cdc2 kinase, observed in this study by footprinting techniques, is probably accompanied by changes in the conformation of the DNA.

They include two closely related proteins, one that binds to the protein A of Staphylococcus aureus (PAP) and another that binds to the lipopolysaccharide ofEscherichia coli (LBP). PAP binds specifically to staphylococcal protein A (SpA) with a K D of 3.86 × 10−5m, whereas LBP binds to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with a K D of 1.03 × 10−6m. Both PAP and LBP are glycoproteins with an apparent molecular mass of about 40 kDa. N-terminal sequences of PAP and LBP showed 61.9 and 72.2% identity, respectively, to tachylectin-3, a lectin isolated from the amebocyte of T. tridentatus, previously characterized by its affinity to the O-antigen of LPS and blood group A antigen (Muta, T., and Iwanaga, S. (1996) Curr. Opin. Immunol. 8, 41–47). The third protein, a galactose-binding protein (GBP), was found to bind tightly to Sepharose CL-4B and could only be eluted from the column matrix with chaotropic agents, such as 4 m urea or 2 mguanidine hydrochloride. Further analysis indicated that GBP binds tod(+)-galactose with a K D of 2.47 × 10−7m. N-terminal sequence analysis showed that GBP shared a 50% identity with lectin L-6, identified in the granules of amebocyte of T. tridentatus. (Gokudan, S., Muta, T., Tsuda, R., Koori, K., Kawahara, T., Seki, N., Mizunoe, Y., Wai, S. N., Iwanaga, S., and Kawabata, S. (1999) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 96, 10086–10091). Lectin-L6 and tachylectin-3 are nonglycosylated intracellular proteins with about half the molecular mass of PAP, LBP, and GBP. GBP also binds to PAP and LBP with K D values of 1.25 × 10−7 and 1.43 × 10−8m,respectively, and this binding is enhanced about 10-fold upon the addition of SpA and LPS to form the GBP·PAP·SpA and GBP·LBP·LPS complexes, respectively.

The pathogen-specific lectins in the hemolymph are expected to distinguish between self and non-self and to serve as the first line of defense upon the entry of pathogens. The interaction between lectins and pathogens results in the recruitment of other defense mechanisms, which ultimately are responsible for the immobilization and elimination of the invading pathogens.The hemolymph of horseshoe crab contains three major proteins: hemocyanin, C-reactive protein, and α2-macroglobulin. Hemocyanin functions as oxygen-carrying protein. C-reactive proteins are lectins that bind to phosphocholine of the pneumonococcus C-polysaccharide (7.Volanakis J.E. Kaplan M.H. Proc. Exp. Bio. Med. 1971; 136: 612-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) and to the chromatins of damaged cells (8.Robey F.A. Liu T.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 969-975Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). α2-macroglobulin exhibits protease inhibitory activity with a broad specificity that can block the activities of proteases secreted from invading microorganisms (9.Enghild J.J.

The Limulus C-reactive proteins, along with the C3 homologue α2-macroglobulin, participates in a complement-like hemolytic activity in horseshoe crab hemolymph (11.Armstrong P.B. Armstrong M.T. Quigley J.P. Mol. Immunol. 1993; 30: 929-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).Recently, several lectins have been identified in the amebocytes of horseshoe crab, with a broad range of specificity (2.Gokudan S. Muta T. Tsuda R. Koori K. Kawahara T. Seki N. Mizunoe Y. Wai S.N. Iwanaga S. Kawabata S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10086-10091Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 12.Saito T.

Immunol. 1999; 23: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). These lectins have been proposed to function in concert to defend horseshoe crabs from invading pathogens. However, because these lectins are present in the granules of the hemocytes, they are unlikely to be involved in the immediate-early response of host-pathogen interaction.In this study, we report the isolation and characterization of three novel pathogen-specific proteins from the hemolymph of Tachypleus tridentatus that interact with each other and with pathogen specific antigens, in a manner similar to the opsonization process in vertebrates. A model of interaction for these proteins has been proposed.DISCUSSIONAn invertebrate depends solely on innate immunity, consisting of three major coordinately working systems (pattern recognition, enzymatic cascade, and antimicrobial peptide) to protect itself against microbial invasion. Molecular structures that are integral to the Gram − bacteria, such as LPS, are not subjected to changes during the evolutionary process and are highly conserved among these microorganisms. Molecules that are able to recognize these structures would thus be able to identify a wide spectrum of bacteria. In this study, we have isolated and characterized such a protein from the hemolymph of T. tridentatus, the pattern recognition molecules that specifically interact with the LPS of Gram − bacteria. Independently, PAP, a protein that binds to SpA of a Gram + bacterium, S. aureus, was isolated and characterized. Based on the finding that LBP and PAP share an 80% identity in their N-terminal sequences (Fig. 2 D), LBP and PAP must be very similar, yet each recognizes a different ligand.The N-terminal amino acid sequences (residues 1–19) determined for LBP and for PAP share 47–50% identity with residues 2–20 of lectin L-6, an LPS-binding protein isolated from the large granules of amebocyte (Fig. 2, B and C). Significant sequence homologies were not found with any other proteins for which the sequences have been elucidated. Whereas the plasma LBP is a glycosylated protein, lectin L-6 is a nonglycosylated amebocyte protein (12.Saito T. Hatada M. Iwanaga S. Kawabata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30703-30708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The existence of two similar lectins, an intracellular one and an extracellular one, in the horseshoe crab is reminiscent of the mammalian system (19.Pugin J. Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 2193-2200Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 20.Frey E.A. Miller D.S. Jahr T.G. Sundan A. Bazil V. Espevik T. Finlay B.B. Wright S.D. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1665-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar).The principal reactivity of SpA is binding with IgG at the Fc site and affinity chromatography on SpA-Sepharose is the preferred method of isolating IgG from serum of animals (21.Langone J.J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1982; 55: 277-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Although a number of proteins with IgG-like motif and property have been reported to be present in invertebrates, sequences that are homologous to the Fc site of IgG have not been reported, nor has their binding to SpA been demonstrated (22.Mendoza H.L. Faye I. Dev. Comp. Immunol. 1999; 23: 359-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The binding site of PAP to SpA remains to be elucidated.Notably, the peptidase activities induced by exposure of the plasma to a catalytic amount of LPS were almost quantitatively co-adsorbed with LBP-GBP to the LPS-Sepharose CL-4B affinity column and were co-eluted with GBP with 4 m urea. The origin of the peptidase activity is not known, but judging from the specific activity, which is less than 11000 that of trypsin, it is highly unlikely that it is the intrinsic property of GBP.Data obtained from surface plasmon resonance indicated that GBP also binds with PAP and LBP. Binding of PAP and LBP to GBP significantly enhances the affinity of PAP and LBP to their ligands, SpA and LPS, respectively (Table II). Based on these observations, it is suggested that GBP forms a complex with PAP and LBP in the hemolymph of horseshoe crab. Both PAP and LBP contain a higher amount of galactose than GBP (Table I). It is tempting to speculate that the binding of GBP to PAP and to LBP might be mediated by the galactosyl moiety on PAP and LBP.When pathogens carrying SpA or LPS ligand enter into horseshoe crabs, GBP-anchored LBP or PAP docks onto the pathogens to form the GBP·PAP·SpA or GBP·LBP·LPS complex, as illustrated in Fig. 3. This complex formation could result in the recruitment of other defense mechanism in the amebocytes for the elimination of the invading pathogens.Nature has evolved a series of galactose recognition proteins that are ubiquitously distributed throughout invertebrates and vertebrates (23.Dam T.K.

In this study, we have identified a galactose-binding protein from the hemolymph of horseshoe crabs, which could be a counterpart of anti-Gal IgG in invertebrates.It would seem therefore, that upon the entry of Gram − bacteria, GBP·LBP complex binds to LPS on the bacterial cell surface and at the same time recruit LPS-dependent plasma peptidase to initiate proteolytic attack on the microbes. The affinity of PAP for SpA, as demonstrated by its selective adsorption to SpA-affinity column and the pervasive presence of SpA as a membrane component of Gram + bacterium, such as S. aureus, could signify its importance in the recognition of such microorganisms upon their entry into horseshoe crab. Invertebrates have developed several germ line-encoded receptor-dependent pathways, such as proteolytic and prophenol oxidase cascade, pathogen-specific lectins, and antibiotic peptides, which work in concert for the recognition, immobilization, and elimination of the invading pathogens (1.Muta T.

In this study, we have identified a galactose-binding protein from the hemolymph of horseshoe crabs, which could be a counterpart of anti-Gal IgG in invertebrates.It would seem therefore, that upon the entry of Gram − bacteria, GBP·LBP complex binds to LPS on the bacterial cell surface and at the same time recruit LPS-dependent plasma peptidase to initiate proteolytic attack on the microbes. The affinity of PAP for SpA, as demonstrated by its selective adsorption to SpA-affinity column and the pervasive presence of SpA as a membrane component of Gram + bacterium, such as S. aureus, could signify its importance in the recognition of such microorganisms upon their entry into horseshoe crab. An invertebrate depends solely on innate immunity, consisting of three major coordinately working systems (pattern recognition, enzymatic cascade, and antimicrobial peptide) to protect itself against microbial invasion. Molecular structures that are integral to the Gram − bacteria, such as LPS, are not subjected to changes during the evolutionary process and are highly conserved among these microorganisms. Molecules that are able to recognize these structures would thus be able to identify a wide spectrum of bacteria. In this study, we have isolated and characterized such a protein from the hemolymph of T. tridentatus, the pattern recognition molecules that specifically interact with the LPS of Gram − bacteria. Independently, PAP, a protein that binds to SpA of a Gram + bacterium, S. aureus, was isolated and characterized. Based on the finding that LBP and PAP share an 80% identity in their N-terminal sequences (Fig. 2 D), LBP and PAP must be very similar, yet each recognizes a different ligand. The N-terminal amino acid sequences (residues 1–19) determined for LBP and for PAP share 47–50% identity with residues 2–20 of lectin L-6, an LPS-binding protein isolated from the large granules of amebocyte (Fig. 2, B and C). Significant sequence homologies were not found with any other proteins for which the sequences have been elucidated. Whereas the plasma LBP is a glycosylated protein, lectin L-6 is a nonglycosylated amebocyte protein (12.Saito T. Hatada M. Iwanaga S. Kawabata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30703-30708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The existence of two similar lectins, an intracellular one and an extracellular one, in the horseshoe crab is reminiscent of the mammalian system (19.Pugin J. Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 2193-2200Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 20.Frey E.A. Miller D.S. Jahr T.G. Sundan A. Bazil V. Espevik T. Finlay B.B. Wright S.D. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1665-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). The principal reactivity of SpA is binding with IgG at the Fc site and affinity chromatography on SpA-Sepharose is the preferred method of isolating IgG from serum of animals (21.Langone J.J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1982; 55: 277-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Although a number of proteins with IgG-like motif and property have been reported to be present in invertebrates, sequences that are homologous to the Fc site of IgG have not been reported, nor has their binding to SpA been demonstrated (22.Mendoza H.L. Faye I. Dev. Comp. Immunol. 1999; 23: 359-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The binding site of PAP to SpA remains to be elucidated. Notably, the peptidase activities induced by exposure of the plasma to a catalytic amount of LPS were almost quantitatively co-adsorbed with LBP-GBP to the LPS-Sepharose CL-4B affinity column and were co-eluted with GBP with 4 m urea. The origin of the peptidase activity is not known, but judging from the specific activity, which is less than 11000 that of trypsin, it is highly unlikely that it is the intrinsic property of GBP. Data obtained from surface plasmon resonance indicated that GBP also binds with PAP and LBP. Binding of PAP and LBP to GBP significantly enhances the affinity of PAP and LBP to their ligands, SpA and LPS, respectively (Table II). Based on these observations, it is suggested that GBP forms a complex with PAP and LBP in the hemolymph of horseshoe crab. Both PAP and LBP contain a higher amount of galactose than GBP (Table I). It is tempting to speculate that the binding of GBP to PAP and to LBP might be mediated by the galactosyl moiety on PAP and LBP. When pathogens carrying SpA or LPS ligand enter into horseshoe crabs, GBP-anchored LBP or PAP docks onto the pathogens to form the GBP·PAP·SpA or GBP·LBP·LPS complex, as illustrated in Fig. 3. This complex formation could result in the recruitment of other defense mechanism in the amebocytes for the elimination of the invading pathogens. Nature has evolved a series of galactose recognition proteins that are ubiquitously distributed throughout invertebrates and vertebrates (23.Dam T.K. Sarkar M. Ghosal J. Choudhury A. Mol.

(1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 19166–19172). To evaluate the precise roles that specific phosphorylation sites may play in receptor signaling, a series of mutants were expressed transiently in COS-7 cells and stably in the physiologically relevant myeloid HL-60 cells. Ser334 was found to be a key residue that controls receptor phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of either of two serine pairs, namely Ser332 and Ser334 or Ser334 and Ser338, was critical for the phosphorylation of C5aR and its subsequent desensitization. Full phosphorylation and desensitization of C5aR were obtained when these serines were replaced by aspartic acid residues. The mutation S338A had no marked effect on the agonist-mediated phosphorylation of C5aR, but it allowed a sustained C5a-evoked calcium mobilization in HL-60 cells. These findings and the ability of the S314A/S317A/S327A/S332A mutant receptor to undergo desensitization indicate that the phosphorylation of Ser334 and Ser338 is critical and sufficient for C5aR desensitization. The lack of phosphorylation was found to result not only in a sustained calcium mobilization and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 activity but also in the enhancement of the C5a-mediated respiratory burst in neutrophil-like HL-60 cells. For instance, the nonphosphorylatable S332A/S334A mutant receptor triggered a 1.8–2-fold higher production of superoxide as compared with the wild-type receptor. Interestingly, although the desensitization of this mutant was defective, it was sequestered with the same time course and the same efficiency as the wild-type receptor. Thus, in myeloid HL-60 cells, desensitization and sequestration of C5aR appear to occur through divergent molecular mechanisms.

Phagocytes do this in response to a variety of structurally diverse chemoattractants, including bacterialN-formylated peptides, the complement fragment C5a,1 leukotriene B4, platelet-activating factor, and interleukin 8 (reviewed in Ref. 1.Ye R. Boulay F. Adv. Pharmacol. 1997; 39: 221-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Chemoattractants elicit intracellular signaling through specific receptors that are coupled to the pertussis toxin-sensitive heterotrimeric Gi2 protein. This latter activates in turn second messenger-generating enzymes, including phospholipases C, D, and A2 (reviewed in Ref. 2.Bokoch G.M. Blood. 1995; 86: 1649-1660Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as well as kinases, such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (3.Stephens L. Eguinoa A. Corey S. Jackson T. Hawkins P.T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2265-2273Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and sphingosine kinase (4.Alemany R. Meyer zu Heringdorf D. van Koppen C.J. Jakobs K.H. J. Biol.

This is a crucial bactericidal mechanism, but it is also believed to be a major cause of inflammatory disorders when inappropriately activated.The activation of the NADPH-oxidase complex responsible for the production of superoxide requires the coordinated action of multiple signaling pathways. The NADPH-oxidase becomes functional through a multistep assembly of several components at the plasma membrane, namely the flavocytochrome b 558, the small G proteins (Rac and Rap), and cytosolic factors (p47 phox, p67 phox, and p40 phox) (reviewed in Ref. 5.Babior B.M. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 1995; 2: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The ability of chemoattractants to induce the production of superoxide varies from one chemoattractant to another. The activation of the NADPH-oxidase complex is correlated with the rapid increase in Ca2+ and diacylglycerol, which subsequently activate protein kinase C (PKC), and the phosphorylation of the cytosolic factor p47 phox (6.el Benna J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 6374-6378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The involvement of PKC in triggering the activation of NADPH oxidase is supported by the ability of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) to induce a sustained superoxide production and the phosphorylation and translocation of p47 phox to the plasma membrane (8.Faust L.P. El Benna J. Babior B.M. Chanock S.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1499-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar).Despite the persistent presence of chemoattractants, the intracellular signaling events are transient, with a time course in the minute range. This attenuated responsiveness is thought to result from the desensitization of receptors through their phosphorylation and rapid sequestration (reviewed in Refs. 9.Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. Caron M. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 653-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar and 10.Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

The current concept for desensitization of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), largely extrapolated from numerous studies with rhodopsin and the β2-adrenergic receptor, is that arrestin proteins bind to the phosphorylated receptors and sterically prevent its interaction with the G protein (11.Wilden U.

In addition, β-arrestin acts as a clathrin adapter that targets the agonist-occupied β2-adrenergic receptor to the endocytic pathway via clathrin coated pits (14.Goodman O.B. Krupnick J.G.J.

However, mounting evidence indicates that not all GPCRs are internalized through this pathway. For instance, internalization of the angiotensin II 1A and m2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in HEK293 cells is independent of β-arrestin and is not inhibited when the clathrin-coated vesicle pathway is blocked by overexpression of a dominant negative form of dynamin (17.Zhang J.

The C5a receptor (C5aR) is particularly well suited to examine this issue because previous studies have shown the rapid agonist-mediated phosphorylation of this receptor on serine residues in differentiated HL-60 cells and after heterologous expression (20.Tardif M. Mery L. Brouchon L. Boulay F. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 3534-3545PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Ali H. Richardson R.M. Tomhave E.D. Didsbury J.R. Snyderman R. J. Biol.

In transfected COS-7 cells, the six serine residues of the carboxyl-terminal domain, at positions 314, 317, 327, 332, 334, and 338, were identified as the major phosphorylation sites, but it is not known whether a stoichiometry of 6 phosphate groups per receptor is required for receptor desensitization (22.Giannini E. Brouchon L. Boulay F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19166-19172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).In this paper, we show that phosphorylation of either of the two serine pairs (Ser332/Ser334 and Ser334/Ser338) is a prerequisite for full receptor phosphorylation. This strongly supports the notion that C5aR is sequentially phosphorylated upon agonist binding. However, phosphorylation of the first four serine residues was found to be dispensable for receptor desensitization. In stably transfected HL-60 cells, receptor sequestration was found to be independent of receptor desensitization. In addition, the results show for the first time that a nonphosphorylatable receptor is able to support sustained intracellular signaling events that result in a significant increase in the production of superoxide by neutrophil-like differentiated HL-60 cells. This indicates that cell adaptation to a persistent stimulus is to some extent dependent on receptor phosphorylation.

In stably transfected HL-60 cells, receptor sequestration was found to be independent of receptor desensitization. In addition, the results show for the first time that a nonphosphorylatable receptor is able to support sustained intracellular signaling events that result in a significant increase in the production of superoxide by neutrophil-like differentiated HL-60 cells. This indicates that cell adaptation to a persistent stimulus is to some extent dependent on receptor phosphorylation."

Each of these events depends on glucose metabolism. Both intrinsic oscillations of metabolism and repetitive activation of mitochondrial dehydrogenases by Ca2+ have been suggested to be decisive for this oscillatory behavior. Among these dehydrogenases, mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (mGPDH), the key enzyme of the glycerol phosphate NADH shuttle, is activated by cytosolic [Ca2+]i. In the present study, we compared different types of oscillations in β cells from wild-type and mGPDH−/− mice. In clusters of 5–30 islet cells and in intact islets, 15 mm glucose induced an initial drop of [Ca2+]i, followed by an increase in three phases: a marked initial rise, a partial decrease with rapid oscillations and eventually large and slow oscillations. These changes, in particular the frequency of the oscillations and the magnitude of the [Ca2+] rise, were similar in wild-type and mGPDH−/− mice. Glucose-induced electrical activity (oscillations of the membrane potential with bursts of action potentials) was not altered in mGPDH−/− β cells. In single islets from either type of mouse, insulin secretion strictly followed the changes in [Ca2+]i during imposed oscillations induced by pulses of high K+ or glucose and during the biphasic elevation induced by sustained stimulation with glucose. An imposed and controlled rise of [Ca2+]i in β cells similarly increased NAD(P)H fluorescence in control and mGDPH−/− islets. Inhibition of the malate-aspartate NADH shuttle with aminooxyacetate only had minor effects in control islets but abolished the electrical, [Ca2+]i and secretory responses in mGPDH−/− islets. The results show that the two distinct NADH shuttles play an important but at least partially redundant role in glucose-induced insulin secretion. The oscillatory behavior of β cells does not depend on the functioning of mGPDH and on metabolic oscillations that would be generated by cyclic activation of this enzyme by Ca2+.

Physiol. 1996; 271: E702-E710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is still unclear whether oscillations of glucose metabolism are intrinsic and initiate the whole chain of other pulsatile events or are entrained by the oscillations of [Ca2+]i (27.Tornheim K. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1375-1380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Ca2+ sensitivity of mGPDH makes the enzyme a possible key site of the interplay between glucose metabolism and [Ca2+]i oscillations. Thus, imposed oscillations of free Ca2+ in islet mitochondrial extracts induced oscillations of mGPDH activity (28.MacDonald M.J. Al-Masri H. Jumelle-Laclau M. Cruz M.O. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1996-2001Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). If the hypothesis is correct, the oscillatory behavior of stimulus secretion coupling should be perturbed by mGPDH defects. The present study addressed this question with islets isolated from mGPDH knock-out (mGPDH−/−) mice (21.Eto K. Tsubamoto Y. Terauchi Y. Sugiyama T. Kishimoto T. Takahashi N. Yamauchi N. Kubota N. Murayama S. Aizawa T. Akanuma Y. Aizawa S. Kasai H. Yazaki Y. Kadowaki T. Science. 1999; 283: 981-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). We compared the oscillations of β cell membrane potential, [Ca2+]i, and insulin secretion in islet cell clusters or single islets from wild-type (mGPDH+/+) and mGPDH−/− mice. The impact of an inhibition of the malate-aspartate shuttle by aminooxyacetate (AOA) (17.MacDonald M.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 213: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 29.Malaisse W.J. Malaisse-Lagae F. Sener A. Endocrinology. 1982; 111: 392-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) was also evaluated in the two groups.DISCUSSIONThe mGPDH is the rate-limiting enzyme of the glycerol phosphate shuttle which, together with the malate-aspartate shuttle, permits reoxidation of cytosolic NADH by transferring reducing equivalents produced during glycolysis to the mitochondria.mGPDH is particularly abundant in pancreatic islets (16.MacDonald M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8287-8290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and, in contrast to lactate dehydrogenase, much more so in β than non-β cells (12.Schuit F. De Vos A. Farfari S. Moens K. Pipeleers D. Brun T. Prentki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18572-18579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 15.Sekine N. Cirulli V. Regazzi R. Brown L.J.

This peculiar biochemical organization (high mGPDH/lactate dehydrogenase ratio) is thought to be important for optimal coupling of glucose metabolism by the β cell and insulin secretion. Observations of a decreased activity of mGPDH in islets from type 2 diabetic patients and several animal models of the disease (11.Malaisse W.J. Diabetes Rev. 1996; 4: 145-159Google Scholar) have lent support to this concept, although recent studies have challenged the hypothesis (39.MacDonald M.J. Efendic S. Ostenson C.-G. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 886-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 40.Ueda K. Tanizawa Y. Ishihara H. Kizuki N. Ohta Y. Matsutani A. Oka Y. Diabetologia. 1998; 41: 649-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).Mice with a targeted disruption of mGPDH have recently been generated and found to be grossly normal. In particular, they were not diabetic and their islets responded to glucose stimulation by similar increases in the ATP/ADP ratio and insulin secretion to those observed in control islets (21.Eto K. Tsubamoto Y. Terauchi Y. Sugiyama T. Kishimoto T. Takahashi N. Yamauchi N. Kubota N. Murayama S. Aizawa T. Akanuma Y. Aizawa S. Kasai H. Yazaki Y. Kadowaki T. Science. 1999; 283: 981-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). The present study extends these findings in showing that the glucose-induced electrical activity and [Ca2+]i rise are quantitatively equivalent in wild-type and mGPDH−/− islets, and that the oscillatory characteristics of the electrical, ionic, and secretory events induced by glucose are similar in both types of islets. Since no mGPDH could be detected immunologically or enzymatically in mGPDH−/−islets it appears that the malate-aspartate shuttle can compensate for the absence of glycerol-phosphate shuttle in all these biological functions.AOA, an inhibitor of various aminotransferases, is widely used to block the malate-aspartate shuttle in islets and other tissues (17.MacDonald M.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 213: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 29.Malaisse W.J. Malaisse-Lagae F. Sener A. Endocrinology. 1982; 111: 392-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 41.Berry M.N. Gregory R.B. Grivell A.R. Phillips J.W. Schön A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 557-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar,42.Barron J.T. Gu L. Parrillo J.E. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1998; 30: 1571-1579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). At the concentration of 5 mm, AOA inhibed glucose-induced insulin secretion by 50–60% in normal rat islets (17.MacDonald M.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 213: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar,29.Malaisse W.J. Malaisse-Lagae F. Sener A. Endocrinology. 1982; 111: 392-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Smaller effects were observed in wild-type mouse islets. Glucose-induced electrical activity and [Ca2+]irise were only attenuated and insulin secretion was slightly impaired and delayed. If the effects of AOA solely result from an inhibition of the malate-aspartate shuttle, which is uncertain owing to the drug action on several aminotransferases, our results would suggest that the malate-aspartate shuttle might exert functions that cannot be compensated for by the glycerol phosphate shuttle. However, the minor effects of AOA in control islets strikingly contrast with the abrogation by the drug of the electrical, [Ca2+]iand secretory responses to glucose in mGPDH−/− islets. It has been reported that the rise in the ATP/ADP ratio that glucose produces in β cells (43.Detimary P. Dejonghe S. Ling Z. Pipeleers D. Schuit F. Henquin J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33905-33908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) of normal islets (34.Detimary P. Jonas J.C. Henquin J.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1738-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) is markedly attenuated by AOA in mGPDH−/− islets (21.Eto K. Tsubamoto Y. Terauchi Y. Sugiyama T. Kishimoto T. Takahashi N. Yamauchi N. Kubota N. Murayama S. Aizawa T. Akanuma Y. Aizawa S. Kasai H. Yazaki Y. Kadowaki T. Science. 1999; 283: 981-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). This reflects a major alteration of glucose metabolism (21.Eto K. Tsubamoto Y. Terauchi Y. Sugiyama T. Kishimoto T. Takahashi N. Yamauchi N. Kubota N. Murayama S. Aizawa T. Akanuma Y. Aizawa S. Kasai H. Yazaki Y. Kadowaki T. Science. 1999; 283: 981-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) and may explain why the β cell membrane was no longer depolarized and Ca2+ influx, manifested by the electrical activity, was no longer stimulated by glucose. At variance with a previous report (21.Eto K. Tsubamoto Y. Terauchi Y. Sugiyama T. Kishimoto T. Takahashi N. Yamauchi N. Kubota N. Murayama S. Aizawa T. Akanuma Y. Aizawa S. Kasai H. Yazaki Y. Kadowaki T. Science. 1999; 283: 981-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), [Ca2+]i remained low when mGPDH−/−islets were challenged with glucose in the presence of AOA. There was thus no paradoxical dissociation between [Ca2+]iand the suppression of insulin secretion. We, therefore, conclude that the NADH shuttles play an important role in glucose-induced insulin secretion and that the normal functioning of one of the two shuttles can largely compensate for an impairment of the other. This at least partial redundancy of the two NADH shuttles supports the importance of the system for the β cell functioning.The major goal of this study was to evaluate whether mGPDH is involved in the oscillatory behavior of β cells. A number of events regularly oscillate in β cells during stimulation with a constant concentration of glucose. The origin of these oscillations is still incompletely understood (27.Tornheim K. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1375-1380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but a subtle interplay between metabolic and [Ca2+]i changes may be involved. In this respect, the sensitivity of mGPDH to cytosolic [Ca2+]ichanges potentially confers a central position to the enzyme (28.MacDonald M.J. Al-Masri H. Jumelle-Laclau M. Cruz M.O. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1996-2001Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The present results, however, do not support this hypothesis. Thus, no differences could be identified between glucose-induced oscillations of β cell membrane potential and [Ca2+]i in wild-type and mGPDH−/− β cells. The different phases of the changes (initial fall, large increase and oscillations) and the distinct patterns of the oscillations (regular fast or slow, and mixed fast and slow) were all observed in both types of islets. Their quantitative characteristics were also similar.It has been proposed that a rise in β cell cytosolic [Ca2+]i stimulates mitochondrial metabolism at the levels of mGPDH and intramitochondrial dehydrogenases (13.Kennedy E.D. Wollheim C.B. Diabetes Metab. 1998; 24: 15-24PubMed Google Scholar, 14.McCormack J.G. Halestrap A.P. Denton R.M. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 391-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar, 18.Rasschaert J. Malaisse W.J. Biochem. J. 1991; 278: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar,19.Rutter G.A. Pralong W.F. Wollheim C.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1175: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 44.Civelek V.N. Deeney J.T. Shalosky N.J. Tornheim K. Hansford R.G. Prentki M. Corkey B.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This mechanism is viewed as a feed-forward process promoting ATP synthesis to sustain the secretory response. The present study, however, shows that repetitive stimulations with high glucose or high K+ induced pulses of insulin secretion from mGPDH−/− islets, which did not differ from the control ones. No decrease in the response was observed, nor was there any tendency to a fall during the second phase of insulin secretion induced by sustained glucose stimulation. These results do not support the idea that mGPDH is a critical site where changes in cytosolic [Ca2+]i play a regulatory role in glucose metabolism and subsequent functional events. Similar doubts have been raised by studies of the effects of Ca2+ on ATP production by islet mitochondria incubated with glycerol 3-phosphate (45.Idahl L.-A. Lembert N. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). One should also keep in mind that the increase in NAD(P)H fluorescence, that follows glucose stimulation, is largely independent of an intracellular [Ca2+]i rise (Fig. 7). In addition and even more importantly, the increase in NAD(P)H fluorescence brought about by Ca2+ in low or high glucose was not affected by the inactivation of mGPDH. [Ca2+]i stimulation of glucose metabolism through activation of intramitochondrial dehydrogenases thus appears to be independent of the functioning of the glycerol phosphate shuttle and its activation by [Ca2+]i.In conclusion, NADH shuttles play an important role in the regulation of insulin secretion by glucose but seem to be at least partially redundant. Despite its [Ca2+]i dependence and ability to display an oscillatory function in vitro, mGPDH is not the generator of metabolic signals that might in turn induce oscillatory biophysical and secretory responses in β cells. Stimulation of insulin secretion by glucose involves a rise in the cytoplasmic concentration of Ca2+([Ca2+]i)1in β cells (1.Wollheim C.B. Sharp G.W.G. Physiol. Rev. 1981; 61: 914-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar, 2.Prentki M. Matschinsky F.M. Physiol. Rev. 1987; 67: 1185-1248Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Oscillations of the membrane potential drive oscillations of [Ca2+]i, leading to oscillations of insulin secretion that can be amplified by metabolic oscillations (4.Gilon P. Henquin J.C. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1996; 271: E702-E710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is still unclear whether oscillations of glucose metabolism are intrinsic and initiate the whole chain of other pulsatile events or are entrained by the oscillations of [Ca2+]i (27.Tornheim K. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1375-1380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Ca2+ sensitivity of mGPDH makes the enzyme a possible key site of the interplay between glucose metabolism and [Ca2+]i oscillations. Thus, imposed oscillations of free Ca2+ in islet mitochondrial extracts induced oscillations of mGPDH activity (28.MacDonald M.J. Al-Masri H. Jumelle-Laclau M. Cruz M.O. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1996-2001Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). If the hypothesis is correct, the oscillatory behavior of stimulus secretion coupling should be perturbed by mGPDH defects. The present study addressed this question with islets isolated from mGPDH knock-out (mGPDH−/−) mice (21.Eto K. Tsubamoto Y. Terauchi Y. Sugiyama T. Kishimoto T. Takahashi N. Yamauchi N. Kubota N. Murayama S. Aizawa T. Akanuma Y. Aizawa S. Kasai H. Yazaki Y. Kadowaki T. Science. 1999; 283: 981-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). We compared the oscillations of β cell membrane potential, [Ca2+]i, and insulin secretion in islet cell clusters or single islets from wild-type (mGPDH+/+) and mGPDH−/− mice. The impact of an inhibition of the malate-aspartate shuttle by aminooxyacetate (AOA) (17.MacDonald M.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 213: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 29.Malaisse W.J. Malaisse-Lagae F. Sener A. Endocrinology. 1982; 111: 392-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) was also evaluated in the two groups. DISCUSSIONThe mGPDH is the rate-limiting enzyme of the glycerol phosphate shuttle which, together with the malate-aspartate shuttle, permits reoxidation of cytosolic NADH by transferring reducing equivalents produced during glycolysis to the mitochondria.mGPDH is particularly abundant in pancreatic islets (16.MacDonald M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8287-8290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and, in contrast to lactate dehydrogenase, much more so in β than non-β cells (12.Schuit F. De Vos A. Farfari S. Moens K. Pipeleers D. Brun T. Prentki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18572-18579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 15.Sekine N. Cirulli V. Regazzi R. Brown L.J.

This peculiar biochemical organization (high mGPDH/lactate dehydrogenase ratio) is thought to be important for optimal coupling of glucose metabolism by the β cell and insulin secretion. Observations of a decreased activity of mGPDH in islets from type 2 diabetic patients and several animal models of the disease (11.Malaisse W.J. Diabetes Rev. 1996; 4: 145-159Google Scholar) have lent support to this concept, although recent studies have challenged the hypothesis (39.MacDonald M.J. Efendic S. Ostenson C.-G. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 886-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 40.Ueda K. Tanizawa Y. Ishihara H. Kizuki N. Ohta Y. Matsutani A. Oka Y. Diabetologia. 1998; 41: 649-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).Mice with a targeted disruption of mGPDH have recently been generated and found to be grossly normal. In particular, they were not diabetic and their islets responded to glucose stimulation by similar increases in the ATP/ADP ratio and insulin secretion to those observed in control islets (21.Eto K. Tsubamoto Y. Terauchi Y. Sugiyama T. Kishimoto T. Takahashi N. Yamauchi N. Kubota N. Murayama S. Aizawa T. Akanuma Y. Aizawa S. Kasai H. Yazaki Y. Kadowaki T. Science. 1999; 283: 981-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). The present study extends these findings in showing that the glucose-induced electrical activity and [Ca2+]i rise are quantitatively equivalent in wild-type and mGPDH−/− islets, and that the oscillatory characteristics of the electrical, ionic, and secretory events induced by glucose are similar in both types of islets. Since no mGPDH could be detected immunologically or enzymatically in mGPDH−/−islets it appears that the malate-aspartate shuttle can compensate for the absence of glycerol-phosphate shuttle in all these biological functions.AOA, an inhibitor of various aminotransferases, is widely used to block the malate-aspartate shuttle in islets and other tissues (17.MacDonald M.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 213: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 29.Malaisse W.J. Malaisse-Lagae F. Sener A. Endocrinology. 1982; 111: 392-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 41.Berry M.N. Gregory R.B. Grivell A.R. Phillips J.W. Schön A. Eur. J.

Cardiol. 1998; 30: 1571-1579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). At the concentration of 5 mm, AOA inhibed glucose-induced insulin secretion by 50–60% in normal rat islets (17.MacDonald M.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 213: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar,29.Malaisse W.J. Malaisse-Lagae F. Sener A. Endocrinology. 1982; 111: 392-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Smaller effects were observed in wild-type mouse islets. Glucose-induced electrical activity and [Ca2+]irise were only attenuated and insulin secretion was slightly impaired and delayed. If the effects of AOA solely result from an inhibition of the malate-aspartate shuttle, which is uncertain owing to the drug action on several aminotransferases, our results would suggest that the malate-aspartate shuttle might exert functions that cannot be compensated for by the glycerol phosphate shuttle. However, the minor effects of AOA in control islets strikingly contrast with the abrogation by the drug of the electrical, [Ca2+]iand secretory responses to glucose in mGPDH−/− islets. It has been reported that the rise in the ATP/ADP ratio that glucose produces in β cells (43.Detimary P. Dejonghe S. Ling Z. Pipeleers D. Schuit F. Henquin J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33905-33908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) of normal islets (34.Detimary P. Jonas J.C. Henquin J.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1738-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) is markedly attenuated by AOA in mGPDH−/− islets (21.Eto K. Tsubamoto Y. Terauchi Y. Sugiyama T. Kishimoto T. Takahashi N. Yamauchi N. Kubota N. Murayama S. Aizawa T. Akanuma Y. Aizawa S. Kasai H. Yazaki Y. Kadowaki T. Science. 1999; 283: 981-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). This reflects a major alteration of glucose metabolism (21.Eto K. Tsubamoto Y. Terauchi Y. Sugiyama T. Kishimoto T. Takahashi N. Yamauchi N. Kubota N. Murayama S. Aizawa T. Akanuma Y. Aizawa S. Kasai H. Yazaki Y. Kadowaki T. Science. 1999; 283: 981-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) and may explain why the β cell membrane was no longer depolarized and Ca2+ influx, manifested by the electrical activity, was no longer stimulated by glucose. At variance with a previous report (21.Eto K. Tsubamoto Y. Terauchi Y. Sugiyama T. Kishimoto T. Takahashi N. Yamauchi N. Kubota N. Murayama S. Aizawa T. Akanuma Y. Aizawa S. Kasai H. Yazaki Y. Kadowaki T. Science. 1999; 283: 981-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), [Ca2+]i remained low when mGPDH−/−islets were challenged with glucose in the presence of AOA. There was thus no paradoxical dissociation between [Ca2+]iand the suppression of insulin secretion. We, therefore, conclude that the NADH shuttles play an important role in glucose-induced insulin secretion and that the normal functioning of one of the two shuttles can largely compensate for an impairment of the other. This at least partial redundancy of the two NADH shuttles supports the importance of the system for the β cell functioning.The major goal of this study was to evaluate whether mGPDH is involved in the oscillatory behavior of β cells. A number of events regularly oscillate in β cells during stimulation with a constant concentration of glucose. The origin of these oscillations is still incompletely understood (27.Tornheim K. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1375-1380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but a subtle interplay between metabolic and [Ca2+]i changes may be involved. In this respect, the sensitivity of mGPDH to cytosolic [Ca2+]ichanges potentially confers a central position to the enzyme (28.MacDonald M.J. Al-Masri H. Jumelle-Laclau M. Cruz M.O. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1996-2001Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The present results, however, do not support this hypothesis. Thus, no differences could be identified between glucose-induced oscillations of β cell membrane potential and [Ca2+]i in wild-type and mGPDH−/− β cells. The different phases of the changes (initial fall, large increase and oscillations) and the distinct patterns of the oscillations (regular fast or slow, and mixed fast and slow) were all observed in both types of islets. Their quantitative characteristics were also similar.It has been proposed that a rise in β cell cytosolic [Ca2+]i stimulates mitochondrial metabolism at the levels of mGPDH and intramitochondrial dehydrogenases (13.Kennedy E.D. Wollheim C.B. Diabetes Metab. 1998; 24: 15-24PubMed Google Scholar, 14.McCormack J.G. Halestrap A.P. Denton R.M. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 391-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar, 18.Rasschaert J. Malaisse W.J. Biochem. J. 1991; 278: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar,19.Rutter G.A. Pralong W.F. Wollheim C.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1175: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 44.Civelek V.N. Deeney J.T. Shalosky N.J. Tornheim K. Hansford R.G. Prentki M. Corkey B.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This mechanism is viewed as a feed-forward process promoting ATP synthesis to sustain the secretory response. The present study, however, shows that repetitive stimulations with high glucose or high K+ induced pulses of insulin secretion from mGPDH−/− islets, which did not differ from the control ones. No decrease in the response was observed, nor was there any tendency to a fall during the second phase of insulin secretion induced by sustained glucose stimulation. These results do not support the idea that mGPDH is a critical site where changes in cytosolic [Ca2+]i play a regulatory role in glucose metabolism and subsequent functional events. Similar doubts have been raised by studies of the effects of Ca2+ on ATP production by islet mitochondria incubated with glycerol 3-phosphate (45.Idahl L.-A. Lembert N. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). One should also keep in mind that the increase in NAD(P)H fluorescence, that follows glucose stimulation, is largely independent of an intracellular [Ca2+]i rise (Fig. 7). In addition and even more importantly, the increase in NAD(P)H fluorescence brought about by Ca2+ in low or high glucose was not affected by the inactivation of mGPDH. [Ca2+]i stimulation of glucose metabolism through activation of intramitochondrial dehydrogenases thus appears to be independent of the functioning of the glycerol phosphate shuttle and its activation by [Ca2+]i.In conclusion, NADH shuttles play an important role in the regulation of insulin secretion by glucose but seem to be at least partially redundant. Despite its [Ca2+]i dependence and ability to display an oscillatory function in vitro, mGPDH is not the generator of metabolic signals that might in turn induce oscillatory biophysical and secretory responses in β cells.

In this report we have investigated the molecular basis of PAH-induced cell cycle arrest. Mitogenic signaling events involving cyclins D and E, Rb phosphorylation, and transcriptional activation of E2F-responsive genes (including cyclin E and cyclin A) were unaffected in cells containing PAH-damaged DNA. However, PAH-induced growth arrest was associated with post-transcriptional decreases in cyclin A expression. Mitogen-induced expression of cyclin B, an event that is temporally distal to cyclin A expression, was also inhibited in PAH-treated cells. The PAH-induced cell cycle block was transient, and arrested cells resumed DNA synthesis after a prolonged (∼20 h) delay. Resumption of DNA synthesis in PAH-treated cells occurred concomitant with elevated expression of cyclins A and B. PAH-induced cell cycle arrest was overcome by ectopically expressed cyclin A (encoded by a recombinant adenovirus in transiently infected cells).

Overall, our results suggest the existence of a DNA damage checkpoint pathway that arrests cell cycle progression via post-transcriptional control of cyclin A expression. polycyclic aryl hydrocarbon benzo[a]pyrene aryl hydrocarbon receptor benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxides cyclin-dependent kinase cytomegalovirus Polycyclic aryl hydrocarbons (PAHs),1 typified by the common pollutant benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), are widespread and persistent environmental contaminants (1.Baum E.J. Gelboin H.V. Polycyclic Hydrocarbons and Cancer, Environment Chemistry and Metabolism. Academic Press, New York1978: 45-70Google Scholar). PAHs are potent mutagens and carcinogens in experimental animals and transform rodent and human cells to malignancy in culture. (2.Heidelberger C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1975; 44: 79-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). Epidemiological studies have shown strong correlations between human exposure to PAHs and susceptibility to certain cancers (3.Mastrangelo G. Fadda E. Marzia V. Environ. Health Perspect. 1994; 104: 1166-1170Crossref Scopus (373) Google Scholar). For example, PAH-rich tobacco smoke is considered to be a causative factor for lung cancer in smokers (4.Minna J.D. Sekido Y. Fong K.M. Gazdar A.F. Cancer: Principles and Practice of Oncology. 5th Ed. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1997: 849-857Google Scholar). Many PAHs, including B[a]P, are able to bind to and activate a ligand-dependent transcription factor termed thearyl hydrocarbon receptor or AhR (5.Hankinson O. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 307-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1431) Google Scholar). When activated by appropriate ligands, AhR translocates to the nucleus and dimerizes with a related protein termed arylhydrocarbon receptor nucleartranslocator, or ARNT (5.Hankinson O. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 307-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1431) Google Scholar). Ligand-activated AhR/ARNT heterodimers bind to specific nucleotide sequences in the promoter regions of AhR-responsive genes (termed xenobioticresponse elements or XREs). Xenobiotic response elements are present in the promoter regions of genes encoding cytochromes P 450 1A1 and 1A2 (5.Hankinson O. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 307-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1431) Google Scholar, 6.Denison M.J. Whitlock J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18175-18178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). These cytochromes are said to be “substrate-inducible,” since many of the PAHs that induce AhR-dependent transcription of these genes are also substrates for the oxidative reactions carried out by the cytochrome P-450 proteins. PAHs such as B[a]P are not themselves genotoxic (DNA-damaging). However, the hydroxyl and epoxide species resulting from B[a]P metabolism are highly electrophilic and bind covalently to cellular macromolecules, forming bulky hydrophobic adducts (7.Conney A.H. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 4875-4917PubMed Google Scholar).Benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxides (BPDEs) are the major genotoxic (DNA-damaging) species resulting from B[a]P metabolism and are considered to be the “ultimate carcinogens” generated from B[a]P (7.Conney A.H. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 4875-4917PubMed Google Scholar). BPDEs bind covalently to the exocyclic amino group of guanosine (N2 position) or react with phosphate to produce phosphotriesters. PAH-induced mutagenesis and carcinogenesis results from DNA damage elicited by “metabolically activated” aryl hydrocarbons (7.Conney A.H. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 4875-4917PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Dipple A. Carcinogenesis. 1995; 16: 437-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 9.Hemminki K. Carcinogenesis. 1993; 14: 2007-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Potentially, PAH-induced mutations could arise during DNA mis-replication at damaged sites of electrophilic attack or during error-prone DNA repair. Indeed, substitution mutations as well as frameshifts can result from replication of BPDE-adducted DNA. Therefore, multistep chemical carcinogenesis appears to be due to carcinogen-induced mutations in proto-oncogenes and/or tumor suppressor genes (8.Dipple A. Carcinogenesis. 1995; 16: 437-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 9.Hemminki K. Carcinogenesis. 1993; 14: 2007-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). High levels of PAH-adducted DNA have been found in neoplastic tissues from cancer patients (10.Perera F.P. Estabrook A. Hewer A. Channing K. Rundle A. Mooney L.A. Whyatt R. Phillips D.H. Cancer Epidemiol. Biomark. Prev. 1995; 4: 233-238PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Li D. Wang M. Dhingra K. Hittleman W.M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 287-293PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that environmental PAHs may indeed contribute to neoplasia in humans. A crucial requirement for PAH-induced carcinogenesis is that mutations become “fixed” by mis-replication of damaged genes. Since cells are exposed to intrinsic and extrinsic DNA-damaging agents, they have evolved mechanisms to prevent mutagenic mis-replication of damaged DNA. When the integrity of the genome is compromised, checkpoint mechanisms exert negative controls on cell cycle progression (resulting in growth arrest or apoptosis). These controls prevent potentially error-prone DNA synthesis and therefore protect against mutagenesis and genetic instability (12.Hartwell L.H. Kastan M.B. Science. 1994; 266: 1821-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (2309) Google Scholar). Individuals with inherited defects in known checkpoint genes (such as ataxia telagiectasia patients with defects in the ATM gene) are prone to cancer, which highlights the importance of checkpoint control mechanisms. We unexpectedly identified a novel PAH-induced and DNA damage-dependent cell cycle checkpoint in experiments in which we tested the effects of aryl hydrocarbons on growth factor signal transduction (13.Vaziri C. Faller D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2762-2769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The PAH-induced checkpoint is p53-independent and therefore fundamentally different from many previously identified checkpoints. PAH-activated cell cycle arrest is likely to guard normal cells against the mutagenic and tumorigenic effects of ubiquitous environmental contaminants (such as B[a]P). Therefore, it is important to understand the molecular basis of this potentially important checkpoint. In this report, we have extended our initial studies of PAH-induced DNA damage responses and have identified a new mechanism of checkpoint control. Many genotoxic agents perturb the G1 events that mediate cell cycle progression, thereby resulting in cell cycle arrest prior to S-phase entry (14.Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6731) Google Scholar, 15.Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2290) Google Scholar, 16.Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3213) Google Scholar). We initially tested the hypothesis that PAH-induced cell cycle arrest might similarly result from perturbation of mitogenic signal transduction pathways. Accordingly, we analyzed the effects of PAH-induced DNA damage upon the key mitogenic signals that mediate progression of cells through G1 and into S-phase. Surprisingly, our data show that mitogenic signals involving the G1 cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and the retinoblastoma (Rb)/E2F pathway are unperturbed by PAH-induced DNA damage. This contrasts with the cellular effects of other widely studied genotoxic agents (such as UV and ionizing radiation) that elicit p53-dependent G1 arrest in an Rb-mediated manner (14.Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6731) Google Scholar, 15.Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2290) Google Scholar, 16.Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3213) Google Scholar). Instead, we show that PAH-induced cell cycle arrest occurs after completion of G1 and involves post-transcriptional changes in the expression of cyclin A, a protein that is known to be rate-limiting for progression through S-phase. Unlabeled and [3H]B[a]P were purchased from Sigma and Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, respectively. BPDE was purchased from the NCI Carcinogen Repository. All other materials were purchased from previously specified sources. Swiss 3T3 cells were purchased from ATCC. Cell lines stably expressing the DHFR promoter-luciferase, cyclin A promoter-luciferase, and cyclin E promoter-luciferase plasmids were generated by co-transfection of the promoter-reporter construct with a vector conferring neomycin resistance (pClneo), followed by selection of stably transfected cells in medium containing G418. To generate AdCycA, the human cyclin A cDNA was subcloned into the pACCMV shuttle vector (17.Becker T.C. Noel R.J. Coats W.S. Gomez-Foix A.M. Alam T. Gerard R.D. Newgard C.B. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43: 161-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). The resulting vector (pACCycA) and the pJM17 adenovirus plasmid were co-transfected into 293T cells. Recombinant adenovirus clones were isolated by plaque purification (17.Becker T.C. Noel R.J. Coats W.S. Gomez-Foix A.M. Alam T. Gerard R.D. Newgard C.B. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43: 161-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar) and verified by restriction analysis and Southern blotting. AdGFP was derived in the same manner using a shuttle vector (pACGFP) containing the GFP cDNA. AdCon was derived similarly but by co-transfection of “empty” pACCMV shuttle vector with pJM17. Adenovirus particles were purified from 293T cell lysates by polyethylene glycol precipitation, CsCl gradient centrifugation, and gel filtration column chromatography (17.Becker T.C. Noel R.J. Coats W.S. Gomez-Foix A.M. Alam T. Gerard R.D. Newgard C.B. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43: 161-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). Cells were synchronized in G0 by serum starvation for 48 h as described previously (13.Vaziri C. Faller D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2762-2769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Quiescent cells were stimulated to re-enter the cell cycle by treatment with serum or purified growth factors, as indicated under “Results.” Cell cycle progression was monitored by FACScan analysis or using measurements of [3H]thymidine incorporation as described previously (13.Vaziri C. Faller D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2762-2769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To test the effects of PAHs on cell cycle events, the carcinogens were added to quiescent cultures 24 h before treatment with mitogens, unless otherwise noted. To quantify DNA adducts, cultures were treated with [14C]- or [3H]benzo[a]pyrene (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for the indicated times. After purification of DNA from the [14C]benzo[a]pyrene-treated cultures (18.Pruess-Schwartz D. Mauthe R.J. Baird W.M. Carcinogenesis. 1988; 10: 1863-1868Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar), covalently bound radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting. Transfections were performed using standard calcium phosphate co-precipitation methods (13.Vaziri C. Faller D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2762-2769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Luciferase reporter gene assays were performed as described previously (13.Vaziri C. Faller D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2762-2769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). RNA and protein samples were prepared as and analyzed (by RNA blotting and protein immunoblotting) exactly as described previously (13.Vaziri C. Faller D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2762-2769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). After immunoprecipitation of cyclin-CDK complexes from cell lysates, washed immune complexes were incubated with histone H1 and [32P]ATP. Phosphorylated histone was electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and visualized by autoradiography. These experiments were performed exactly as described by Rosenblatt et al. (19.Rosenblatt J. Gu Y. Morgan D.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 99: 2824-2828Crossref Scopus (286) Google Scholar). All data are representative of experiments that were repeated at least three times with essentially similar results. We have previously shown that B[a]P-induced DNA damage inhibits progression of synchronized mitogen-treated cells through S-phase (Ref. 13.Vaziri C. Faller D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2762-2769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar and Fig.1 A). Growth arrest elicited by many genotoxic agents resulted from negative controls exerted upon G1 mitogenic events (14.Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6731) Google Scholar, 15.Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2290) Google Scholar, 16.Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3213) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that PAH-induced DNA damage may similarly perturb the ordered sequence of mitogen-induced events that normally mediate cell cycle progression. Accordingly, we have analyzed the effect of B[a]P-induced DNA upon mitogen-dependent expression of G1 cyclins (cyclins D1 and E), Rb phosphorylation, and E2F activation. Mitogen treatment of quiescent cells resulted in transcriptional induction of cyclin D1, which attained peak levels of expression during mid-G1 (20.Sherr C.J. Cell. 1993; 73: 1059-1065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1992) Google Scholar). When expressed, cyclin D contributed to the activation of CDKs 4 and 6. In turn, these active CDKs were believed to phosphorylate the Rb tumor suppressor protein, enabling the cells to traverse a restriction point termed the “R-point” (21.Herwig S. Strauss M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 581-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). To test whether B[a]P-induced DNA damage perturbed these G1events, we analyzed the expression of cyclin D1 RNA and protein levels and the phosphorylation status of Rb in control and B[a]P-treated cultures of fibroblasts. As expected, serum-treated fibroblasts expressed high levels of cyclin D1 transcripts relative to control (quiescent) cultures (Fig. 1). As shown in Fig. 1 B, when B[a]P-treated cultures were stimulated with serum, cyclin D1 transcripts were induced to the same high levels attained in control cultures (which lacked DNA damage). In a parallel experiment, we tested the effects of B[a]P upon serum-induced cyclin D1 protein levels. As we found for cyclin D1 transcript levels, cyclin D1 protein expression was unaffected by concentrations of B[a]P that inhibited cell cycle progression (Fig. 1 A). These data indicated that cyclin D1 expression was not rate-limiting for cell cycle progression in cells containing PAH-damaged DNA. Furthermore, this suggested to us that B[a]P might perturb the ordered mitogen-dependent regulation of G1-signaling events at a stage distal to cyclin D expression. Cyclin D1 is thought to drive G1 progression largely by contributing to the activation of CDKs and the resulting phosphorylation of Rb. We considered the possibility that B[a]P (and related PAHs) may prevent mitogen-dependent cell cycle progression by perturbing these processes. To test the effect of PAH treatment upon Rb phosphorylation, we performed immunoblot analysis of Rb protein in whole cell lysates from quiescent, serum-stimulated, and serum plus B[a]P-treated fibroblasts. As expected, mitogenic stimulation resulted in an increase in the amount of slowly migrating, hyperphosphorylated Rb (indicated by the arrow in Fig.1 B, lower panel). Mitogen-treated cells that had received B[a]P showed no change in the amount of hyperphosphorylated Rb relative to cells that were stimulated with serum alone. In the same experiments, replicate cultures received identical treatments but were harvested at a later time for FACScan analysis (Fig. 1 A). These control experiments confirmed that the B[a]P-treated cells indeed failed to progress through S-phase. Therefore, Rb phosphorylation was not rate-limiting for S-phase entry under conditions of B[a]P-induced growth arrest. Rb phosphorylation during late G1 is known to result in de-repression of the activity of E2F family transcription factors (22.Nevins J.R. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 585-593PubMed Google Scholar). Mitogen-dependent activation of E2F and DP (E2F-related factors, which form transcriptionally active dimers with E2F family members)-regulated genes occurs subsequent to Rb phosphorylation and is thought to be necessary for the G1/S-phase transition. Indeed, forced expression of E2F is sufficient to drive quiescent cells into S-phase, supporting the idea that E2F plays an essential role in normal cell cycle progression. We performed experiments to test if PAH-induced DNA damage perturbed E2F activity. We stably transfected cells with a heterologous plasmid containing a minimal E2F-responsive promoter linked to a luciferase reporter cDNA (23.Xiao Z-X. Chen J. Levine A.J. Modjtahedi N. Xing J. Sellers W.R. Livingston D. Nature. 1995; 375: 694-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Mitogen-dependent transcription of this reporter construct is entirely dependent upon the E2F sites within the promoter (23.Xiao Z-X. Chen J. Levine A.J. Modjtahedi N. Xing J. Sellers W.R. Livingston D. Nature. 1995; 375: 694-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). The resulting stably transfected Swiss 3T3 cells (designated S.E.2F-LUC) were synchronized in G0 by serum starvation for 48 h. As in previous experiments, some quiescent cultures were treated with B[a]P (to elicit DNA damage) before serum stimulation. After 15 h of serum treatment (time points distal to Rb phosphorylation and E2F activation), we prepared cytosolic extracts from the cells and assayed these for luciferase activity. As shown in Fig. 1 C, serum treatment resulted in a marked increase in E2F-dependent luciferase activity (relative to control quiescent cultures that received no mitogen). Extracts from cells that were treated with B[a]P did not contain decreased luciferase activity. In fact we consistently noticed slight increases in E2F-dependent luciferase activity in the extracts from B[a]P-treated cells. A possible mechanism for this modest enhancement of serum induction will be discussed in a later section below. Nevertheless, these experiments suggested that E2F activity was not limiting for S-phase entry when the cells acquired B[a]P-induced DNA damage. The experiments described above showed that the cyclin D/Rb/E2F signaling axis was unaffected by DNA damage resulting from doses of B[a]P that elicited cell cycle arrest. We hypothesized therefore, that cell cycle events distal to Rb phosphorylation/E2F activation might be perturbed as a result of B[a]P treatment. Transcriptional induction of cyclin E occurs subsequent to Rb phosphorylation and E2F activation (24.Ohtani K. DeGregori J. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12146-12150Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar) and plays a key role in cell cycle progression. Therefore, we tested the possibility that B[a]P-induced DNA damage might affect signaling events involving cyclin E. To test whether transcriptional induction of cyclin E was affected by B[a]P, we stably transfected Swiss 3T3 cells with a heterologous DNA construct containing the promoter region of the murine cyclin E gene linked to a luciferase cDNA. We tested the effects of B[a]P-induced DNA damage on mitogen-dependent activation of the cyclin E promoter essentially as described above for S.E.2F-LUC cells. As shown in Fig. 2 A, cyclin E promoter-driven luciferase expression was induced by mitogen (serum) treatment, as we had observed for E2F-dependent promoter activity. Cyclin E promoter-dependent luciferase expression was not inhibited as a result of B[a]P treatment (in fact, luciferase activity was consistently slightly elevated in extracts from serum and B[a]P-treated cells, relative to cultures that were treated with serum alone). These data suggested that any putative B[a]P-induced lesions in cell cycle signaling events were likely to occur at a stage distal to cyclin E transcription. To test this possibility, we determined the effects of B[a]P-induced DNA damage upon levels of cyclin E protein and cyclin E-dependent CDK activity, as described below. As is in previous experiments, quiescent cultures of Swiss 3T3 cells were treated with B[a]P (or Me2SO for controls) before treatment with mitogen. 15 h after serum stimulation, we prepared whole cell extracts from the cultures. These extracts were analyzed for cyclin E protein levels by immunoblotting (Fig. 2 B,upper panel) or for cyclin E-dependent kinase activity (Fig. 2 B, lower panel). As expected, extracts from serum-treated cells contained high levels of cyclin E protein relative to extracts from control cultures. However, B[a]P treatment had no effect on the serum-induced expression of cyclin E protein (Fig. 2), suggesting that cyclin E levels were not limiting for cell cycle progression in B[a]P-treated cells. To test the potential effects of B[a]P on cyclin E-associated kinase activity, we performed in vitro kinase assays using anti-cyclin E immunoprecipitates from quiescent, serum-stimulated, and serum + B[a]P-treated cells. The lower panel in Fig.2 B represents an autoradiogram of the phosphorylated histone used as an in vitro substrate for CDK in these assays. Relatively low levels of cyclin E-associated kinase activity were present in extracts from quiescent cells. Serum stimulation resulted in an 11-fold increase in the levels of cyclin E-associated kinase activity recovered from the cell extracts (as determined by Cerenkov counting of the phosphorylated histone protein bands excised from the dried gel). The induction of cyclin E-dependent kinase activity elicited by serum was unaffected in cells that had received additional treatment with B[a]P. These data showed that cyclin E/CDK2 signaling was unaffected by PAH-induced DNA damage. Therefore, changes in cyclin E signaling were unlikely to mediate B[a]P-induced growth arrest. Rb phosphorylation, E2F activation, and increases in cyclin E-dependent kinase activity occur very late in G1 and mediate the transition into S-phase. The results described above showed that B[a]P treatment and acquisition of DNA damage did not perturb these events. This suggested to us that PAH-induced cell cycle arrest might actually occur subsequent to completion of G1 (i.e. during S-phase rather than G1). Consistent with this hypothesis, in previous experiments in which we assayed mitogenesis in PAH-treated cells using measurements of [3H]thymidine incorporation, doses of PAH that were maximally effective for inhibition of cell cycle progression failed to completely abrogate thymidine incorporation (see for example Fig. 1 in Vaziri and Faller (13.Vaziri C. Faller D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2762-2769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar)). Moreover, our FACScan profiles from serum plus B[a]P-treated cells show broadening of the apparent G1 peak and the presence of a significant S-phase population (Fig. 1 A), indicative of cell cycle arrest after commencement of DNA replication. These data suggested that cell cycle arrest in response to PAH damage might result from putative checkpoint mechanisms involving S-phase signaling events. In mammalian cells, responses to DNA damage during the S-phase of the cell cycle have not been as extensively studied as G1 checkpoint mechanisms. However, cells are prone to acquisition of DNA damage during all phases of the cell cycle. Therefore it is highly likely that appropriate mechanisms have evolved to modify cell cycle progression in response to damage acquired during S-phase. Indeed, distinct signaling mechanisms that mediate cell cycle stage-specific checkpoint responses to DNA damage (including S-phase-specific responses) have been described in some eukaryotic organisms (25.Elledge S.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1664-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1764) Google Scholar). In experiments described below, we investigated potential lesions in S-phase signaling events that might constitute an S-phase checkpoint mechanism. During an unperturbed cell cycle, transcriptional induction of cyclin A expression occurs at the G1/S-phase boundary, subsequent to Rb phosphorylation and E2F activation (26.Desdouets C. Sobczak-Thepot J. Murphy M. Brechot C. Meyer L. Guidet S. Tung H.Y.L. Progress in Cell Cycle Research. 1. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1995: 115-123Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Expression of cyclin A continues to rise throughout S-phase and peaks during late S/G2. Cyclin A is considered to play an important and necessary role in regulating the transition from G1 into S-phase (as well as progression through S-phase). Since we did not detect any PAH-induced lesions in critical G1 signaling cascades and because the results of our mitogenic assays were consistent with an S-phase block in response to B[a]P, we tested the consequences of PAH-induced DNA damage upon induction of cyclin A expression and cyclin A-dependent kinase activity. We stably transfected Swiss 3T3 cells with a DNA construct containing the promoter region of the murine cyclin A gene linked to a luciferase cDNA. We tested the effects of treatment with B[a]P upon subsequent mitogen-dependent activation of the cyclin A promoter in the resulting stable transfectants (designated S-CycA-LUC). As expected, serum elicited a strong induction of luciferase expression at time points corresponding to activation of the endogenous cyclin A gene by mitogenic stimuli (Fig.3 A). Luciferase activity in extracts from B[a]P-treated cells was not changed (relative to that present in cells given serum alone), suggesting that transcription of the cyclin A gene was unaffected by B[a]P-induced DNA damage. Consistent with this result, serum stimulation resulted in induction of cyclin A transcripts in control (PAH-untreated) as well as in B[a]P-treated cultures (Fig. 3 B). These results suggested that neither transcription of the cyclin A gene nor levels of cyclin A transcripts were limiting for progression through S-phase in PAH-treated cells. Fig. 3 C shows the result of an immunoblotting experiment (performed in parallel with the RNA blot analysis described above) in which we compared levels of cyclin A protein in control and PAH-treated cultures. In control cultures (that had not received PAH), mitogen treatment resulted in induction of cyclin A protein expression relative to quiescent cultures. Interestingly, however, cyclin A protein levels were markedly reduced in cells that had received B[a]P. Serum-induced expression of cyclin B (which ordinarily occurs distal to expression of cyclin A during a normal cell cycle) was also prevented following acquisition of B[a]P-induced DNA damage (Fig. 3 C). We also performed histone H1 kinase assays in vitro using"
https://openalex.org/W2045860840,"We have investigated the mechanisms of activation of the plasma membrane (PM) Ca-ATPase by calmodulin (CaM), which result in enhanced calcium transport rates and the maintenance of low intracellular calcium levels. We have isolated the amino- or carboxyl-terminal domains of CaM (i.e. CaMN or CaMC), permitting an identification of their relative specificity for binding to sites on either the PM Ca-ATPase or a peptide (C28W) corresponding to the CaM-binding sequence. We find that either CaMN or CaMC alone is capable of productive interactions with the PM Ca-ATPase that induces enzyme activation. There are, however, large differences in the affinity and specificity of binding between CaMN and CaMC and either C28W or the PM Ca-ATPase. The initial binding interaction between CaMC and the PM Ca-ATPase is highly specific, having approximately 10,000-fold greater affinity in comparison with CaMN. However, following the initial association of either CaMC or CaMN, there is a 300-fold enhancement in the affinity of CaMN for the secondary binding site. Thus, while CaMC binds with a high affinity to the two CaM-binding sites within the PM Ca-ATPase in a sequential manner, CaMN binds cooperatively with a lower affinity to both binding sites. These large differences in the binding affinities and specificities of the amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains ensure that CaM binding to the PM Ca-ATPase normally involves the formation of a specific complex in which the initial high affinity association of the carboxyl-terminal domain promotes the association of the amino-terminal domain necessary for enzyme activation. We have investigated the mechanisms of activation of the plasma membrane (PM) Ca-ATPase by calmodulin (CaM), which result in enhanced calcium transport rates and the maintenance of low intracellular calcium levels.

These large differences in the binding affinities and specificities of the amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains ensure that CaM binding to the PM Ca-ATPase normally involves the formation of a specific complex in which the initial high affinity association of the carboxyl-terminal domain promotes the association of the amino-terminal domain necessary for enzyme activation. calmodulin N-terminal domain of calmodulin containing amino acids 1–77 N-terminal domain of calmodulin containing amino acids 1–75 C-terminal domain of calmodulin containing amino acids 78–148 plasma membrane a peptide identical to the CaM-binding sequence of the PM Ca-ATPase with the sequence LRRGQILWFRGLNRIQTQIRVVNAFRSS high performance liquid chromatography A range of diverse metabolic activities involved in intracellular signaling is mediated by calmodulin (CaM),1 which functions as the major calcium sensor in all eukaryotes. CaM binding to a range of different target enzymes, including the plasma membrane (PM) Ca-ATPase, has been suggested to result in an increase in enzymatic function as a result of decreased contact interactions between the autoinhibitory domain and catalytic domain elements that result in enhanced rates of substrate binding or utilization (1.Crivici A. Ikura M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1995; 24: 85-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). CaM binding involves two globular domains, which are connected by an exposed α-helical element often referred to as the central helix (2.Babu Y.S. Bugg C.E. Cook W.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 191-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar, 3.Chattopadhyaya R. Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 1177-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Upon calcium binding, the reorientation of α-helices function to expose hydrophobic binding sites within each domain element in CaM that are surrounded by charged amino acids that lead to complex formation and activation of numerous target proteins with little sequence homology (4.Kuboniwa H.

Backbone folds of the amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains in CaM are structurally similar, and in many instances either domain has been shown to partially activate a range of different target proteins to varying extents (7.Newton D.L.

However, despite the structural homology of the individual CaM binding domains, target protein activation appears to normally involve the specific association of the individual domain elements with specific sequences within the CaM-binding sequence of individual target proteins (7.Newton D.L.

In the case of the PM Ca-ATPase, the carboxyl-terminal domain of CaM has been suggested to be essential for enzyme activation, whereas its amino-terminal domain has been suggested to lack the ability to activate the PM Ca-ATPase without prior association of the carboxyl-terminal domain (16.Guerini D. Krebs J. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 15172-15177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Elshorst B. Hennig M. Försterling H. Diener A. Maurer M. Schulte P. Chwalbe H. Friesinger C. Krebs J. Schmid H. Vorherr T. Carafoli E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12320-12332Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Thus, differences in the interactions between the amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains of CaM and their corresponding binding sites within target proteins have been suggested to play essential roles in target protein activation. In this respect, previous measurements have demonstrated that the binding preferences of individual CaM-binding domains for sites within the CaM-binding sequence of skeletal myosin light chain kinase are relatively small (i.e. less than 1 kcal/mol), suggesting the possibility of multiple conformations of bound CaM that could function to regulate the extent of target protein activation observed in the presence of saturating CaM concentrations (9.Persechini A. McMillan K. Leakey P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16148-16154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Barth A. Martin S.R. Bayley P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2174-2183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that differences in the maximal extent of enzyme activation for the PM Ca-ATPase and other target proteins observed in the presence of saturating CaM concentrations following a range of different post-translational modifications (e.g. phosphorylation or methionine oxidation), site-directed deletions, and substitutions of specific amino acids may all involve alterations in the binding mechanism between the opposing globular domains in CaM and target proteins (7.Newton D.L.

It is therefore of interest to identify the binding mechanisms of CaM that normally lead to enzymatic activation of the PM Ca-ATPase. To accomplish this, we have cloned and expressed the amino-terminal domain of CaM and isolated the carboxyl-terminal domain following trypsin digestion and HPLC purification, permitting us to determine the binding specificities of the individual domains of CaM for the CaM-binding sites within the PM Ca-ATPase and the abilities of the individual CaM domains to induce enzyme activation. These measurements take advantage of the fact that the binding affinity and conformation of CaM bound to either a peptide corresponding to the CaM-binding sequence of the PM Ca-ATPase (i.e. C28W) or to the entire PM Ca-ATPase are virtually identical (13.Chapman E.R. Alexander K. Vorherr T. Carafoli E. Storm D.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12819-12825Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 18.Vorherr T. James P. Krebs J. Enyedi A. McCormick D.J. Penniston J.T. Carafoli E. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 355-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 29.Yao Y. Gao J. Squier T.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12015-12028Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We find that while occupancy of the two binding sites on the PM Ca-ATPase with either CaM domain results in complete enzyme activation, there are large differences in the affinities and specificities of the carboxyl- and amino-terminal domains for the sites within the CaM-binding sequence of the PM Ca-ATPase. Thus, while the carboxyl-terminal domain binds sequentially and independently to the two binding sites, the amino-terminal domain binds in a cooperative manner to both sites. The substantially higher affinity of the carboxyl-terminal domain relative to the amino-terminal domain suggests that activation of the PM Ca-ATPase normally involves the initial association between the carboxyl-terminal domain of CaM to a single site within the CaM-binding sequence of the PM Ca-ATPase, followed by subsequent association with the amino-terminal domain. Trypsin and soybean trypsin inhibitor (STI) were from Worthington. All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma and were of the purest grade commercially available. The peptide C28W, corresponding to the CaM-binding sequence of the PM Ca-ATPase (LRRGQILWFRGLNRIQTQIRVVNAFRSS), was synthesized and purified by Quality Control Co. (Hopkinton, MA). The entire vertebrate CaM or a CaM fragment (CaMN) corresponding to first 77 amino acids in CaM was overexpressed in Escherichia coli JM109 (DE3) cells and purified using phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) chromatography. A fragment corresponding to amino acids 78–148 (CaMC) was obtained following trypsin digestion of CaM. In all cases, CaM or its individual domain elements were purified using weak anion exchange HPLC as described previously (30.Sun H. Yin D. Squier T.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12266-12279Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Erythrocyte ghost membranes containing the PM Ca-ATPase were purified as described previously (21.Yao Y. Yin D. Jas G. Kuczera K. Williams T.D. Schöneich C. Squier T.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2767-2787Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 31.Niggli V. Penniston J.T. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9955-9958Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The CaM-dependent ATPase activity associated with the PM Ca-ATPase was determined by measuring phosphate release, essentially as described previously (21.Yao Y. Yin D. Jas G. Kuczera K. Williams T.D. Schöneich C. Squier T.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2767-2787Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 32.Lanzetta P.A. Alverez L.J. Reinsch P.S. Candia O. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1810) Google Scholar). The ghost membrane protein concentration was determined by the Biuret method (33.Gornal A. Bardawill C. David M. J. Biol. Chem. 1949; 177: 751-766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as the standard. CaM concentration was determined using the Micro-BCA assay (Pierce), where a stock solution of desalted CaM was used as a protein standard (ε277 = 3029 m–1cm–1) (7.Newton D.L. Oldewurtel M.D. Krinks M.H. Shiloach J. Klee C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4419-4426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ATPase activity was measured at 37 °C in a solution containing approximately 16 nm Ca-ATPase (i.e. 0.4 mg ml−1 porcine erythrocyte ghost membranes) in 100 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.1 m KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.44 mm CaCl2, 5 mm ATP, and 4 μm A23187. The free calcium concentration was calculated to be 100 μm (34.Fabiato A. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 378-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar). Major tryptic fragments of CaM corresponding to amino acids 1–75 (CaMN′) and 78–148 (CaMC) were purified using HPLC following proteolytic digestion, essentially as described previously (7.Newton D.L. Oldewurtel M.D. Krinks M.H. Shiloach J. Klee C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4419-4426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Persechini A. McMillan K. Leakey P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16148-16154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.5 mg of CaM in 0.05m NaCl, 40 mm NH4HCO3, and 1 mm CaCl2 was incubated with 20 μg ml−1 trypsin at 30 °C for 60 min. The reaction was quenched by adding 100 μg mg−1 soybean trypsin inhibitor, and the digest was directly loaded onto a J. T. Baker (Phillipsburg, NJ) weak anion exchange HPLC column (WP PEI resin) equilibrated with 25 mm Tris (pH 7.0) (buffer A) at room temperature. The gradient was developed between buffer A and buffer B (25 mm Tris (pH 7.0), 1 m(NH4)2SO4). Buffer A was decreased in 6 min from 99 to 88%, in 24 min from 88 to 56%, and in 2 min from 56 to 10%. The fractions of soybean trypsin inhibitor and trypsin were identified by loading authentic standards separately injected onto the column. Other fractions were collected and dialyzed exhaustively against 10 mm NH4HCO3, lyophilized, and identified using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry essentially as described previously (35.Gao J. Yin D.H. Yao Y. Sun H. Qin Z. Schöneich C. Williams T.D. Squier T.C. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 1115-1134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Final protein concentrations were determined using published extinction coefficients, where ε277(CaM) = 3029 m–1cm–1, ε259(CaMN) = 1680m–1 cm–1, and ε276(CaMC) = 3400 m–1cm–1 (7.Newton D.L. Oldewurtel M.D. Krinks M.H. Shiloach J. Klee C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4419-4426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Steady-state fluorescence spectra of 3 μm C28W in the presence of variable CaM concentrations in 0.1 m HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.1m KCl, and 0.5 mm CaCl2 (buffer C) were measured using a Fluoro Max-2 spectrofluorometer (Jobin Yvon Spex; Edison, NJ) equipped with a xenon lamp. Excitation was at 297 nm using 5-nm slit widths. When appropriate, fluorescence intensity changes associated with CaM binding were detected at 370 nm subsequent to a KV-320 long pass filter. Changes in the solvent accessibility of Trp8 in C28W were assessed through collisional quenching, where variable amounts of acrylamide (8 m stock) were added in microliter increments to 3 μm C28W in the presence of variable concentrations of CaM, CaMN, or CaMC in buffer C (V t = 2 ml). The concentration of CaM free in solution was obtained from the following relationship, [CaM] free=[CaM] total−(V−Vmin)(Vmax−Vmin)×[CaM] maxEquation 1 where V max is the maximal calmodulin-dependent ATPase activity, V is the observed ATPase activity at a defined concentration of CaM, [CaM]free is the concentration of CaM free in solution, [CaM]total is the total concentration of CaM added to the solution, and [CaM]max is the total binding capacity of the erythrocyte ghosts for CaM, which was estimated to correspond to 40 pmol of CaM bound per mg of porcine erythrocyte ghost (21.Yao Y. Yin D. Jas G. Kuczera K. Williams T.D. Schöneich C. Squier T.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2767-2787Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The CaM-dependent activation of the PM Ca-ATPase by CaM assumes an ordered binding mechanism of CaM with the CaM-binding sites (A-B) of the Ca-ATPase (see Scheme I) and is described by the equation, Y=[PMCA] free×K2×[CaM] free2(1+K1×[CaM] free+K2×[CaM] free2)×span+minimumEquation 2 where [PMCA] free=−1+(1+4×K2×[CaM] free2×[PMCA] total) 1/22×K2×[CaM] free2Equation 3 Span is the maximal CaM-dependent enzymatic activity in the presence of saturating CaM, minimum represents the CaM-independent enzymatic activity, and Y represents the PM Ca-ATPase activity resulting from the association of both CaM domains with the Ca-ATPase. [CaM]free is the concentration of CaM not bound to the PM Ca-ATPase. [PMCA]total and [PMCA]free, respectively, represent the total concentrations of the Ca-ATPase and the concentration of the Ca-ATPase with no CaM bound. K 1 corresponds to the equilibrium binding constant k 1 of the carboxyl-terminal domain of CaM to the Ca-ATPase, andK 2 represents the product of the association constants of both domains (i.e. k 12 × k 3b), where k 3b is the apparent association constant for the amino-terminal domain of CaM with the Ca-ATPase. An estimate of the actual association constant (k 3) for the amino-terminal domain can be obtained by taking into account the effective concentration of the amino-terminal domain around the binding site following association of the carboxyl-terminal domain, which equals the following. k3=k3b×b/cEquation 4 The bulk concentration (b) of the amino-terminal domain is assumed to correspond to 1/k 1(i.e. 10 nm). The concentration of the amino-terminal domain (c) is approximately 1.4 mm and is calculated as follows. c=1Na×VEquation 5 N a is Avogadro's number, and V is the volume available to the amino-terminal domain, where the radius corresponds to the overall length of CaM (approximately 100 Å after association with the carboxyl-terminal domain) (36.Kruegar J.K. Bishop N.A. Blumenthal D.K. Zhi G. Beckingham K. Stull J.T. Trewhella J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17810-17817Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The activation of the PM Ca-ATPase by CaMC can be described by the following equation. Y=Kv×[CaMC] free21+KU[CaMC] free+KV[CaMC] free2×span+minimumEquation 6 In this case, K U and K V, respectively, correspond to k 1 andk 1 × k 2 in Scheme I and represent the intrinsic equilibrium constants associated with ligand binding to the two classes of CaM binding sites. If one assumes thatk 1 ≫ k 2, then site A is essentially completely filled prior to the titration of site B (see Scheme I), which is associated with the activation of the Ca-ATPase. Under these latter conditions, the binding affinity of site B can be described by the simple binding equation, Y=k2×[CaMC] free1+k2[CaMC] free×span+minimumEquation 7 The activation of the PM Ca-ATPase by CaMN can be described by the following equation derived from Scheme II. Y=KQ×[CaMN] free21+KP[CaMN] free+KQ[CaMN] free2×span+minimumEquation 8 In this case, K P corresponds tok 1 + k 2, andK Q corresponds to k 1 ×k 3 or k 2 ×k 4 as defined in Scheme II. Likewise, activation of the PMCa-ATPase by an equimolar mixture of CaMN and CaMC can be described by the equation, Y=Equation 9 KB×[CaMC] free2+KC×[CaMC] free×[CaMN] free1+KA×[CaMC] free+KB×[CaMC] free2+KC×[CaMC] free×[CaMN] free×span+minimumwhere K A equals k 1,K B equals k 1 ×k 2, and K C equalsk 1 × k 3. [CaMN]free and [CaMC]free are the unbound concentration of the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of CaM, respectively. CaM contains two binding sites that associate with target proteins located in the amino- and carboxyl-terminal domain (1.Crivici A. Ikura M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1995; 24: 85-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar, 6.Tjandra N. Bax A. Crivici A. Ikura M. Carafoli E. Klee C. Calcium in Cellular Regulation. Oxford University Press, Oxford1999: 152-170Google Scholar), respectively. Following mild trypsin digestion, it is possible to isolate an amino-terminal fragment containing amino acids Ala1–Lys75 (CaMN′) and Asp78 -Lys148 (CaMC) using weak anion exchange HPLC. The identity of these fragments was determined using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry; the observed average molecular masses of CaMN′ and CaMC are 8316 ± 1 and 8147 ± 1 Da, respectively, in close agreement with expected monoisotopic molecular masses of 8316.2 and 8147.8 Da for these CaM fragments. These results suggest that previous measurements in which the amino-terminal domain of CaM was reported to be unable to activate the PM Ca-ATPase probably involved CaMN′ (16.Guerini D. Krebs J. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 15172-15177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in case Met76 and Lys77 located in the linker region between the amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains might play a role in facilitating target protein binding, we have cloned and expressed the amino-terminal domain of CaM containing amino acids Ala1–Lys77(CaMN) in E. coli. CaMN was purified using a phenyl-Sepharose hydrophobic column essentially as described for intact CaM (30.Sun H. Yin D. Squier T.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12266-12279Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and was subsequently purified using weak anion exchange HPLC. Using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, we found that CaMN has an observed average molecular mass of 8576 ± 1 Da, in close agreement with the expected average molecular mass of 8575.6 Da. CaM activates the PM Ca-ATPase; the amount of CaM necessary for half-maximal activation is 3.9 ± 0.4 nm (Fig.1). A similar level of enzymatic activation of the PM Ca-ATPase is observed in the presence of saturating concentrations of either CaMN or CaMC. Thus, in contrast to previous reports where CaMN′ was found to lack the ability to activate the Ca-ATPase (16.Guerini D. Krebs J. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 15172-15177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we found that the inclusion of two additional amino acids in CaMN provided an amino-terminal domain fully capable of activation of the PM Ca-ATPase. However, the apparent affinities of these isolated domains are dramatically lower; half-maximal activation occurs at 6 ± 1 μm CaMN and 1.7 ± 0.2 μm CaMC (Table I). The 1500- and 400-fold higher concentrations, respectively, of CaMN or CaMC necessary for enzyme activation indicate that (i) individual CaM binding domains are not equivalent and may preferentially interact with one of the two binding sites on the CaM-binding sequence and (ii) that the central helix, which functions to join the individual domains of CaM, facilitates specific association of individual domains with their target sites on the Ca-ATPase. The role of the central helix and possible differences in the binding specificity of individual CaM domains was further assessed by adding an equimolar mixture of CaMN and CaMC, which results in activation of the PM Ca-ATPase, with a half-maximal activation of enzymatic activity occurring with a concentration of both fragments of 0.35 ± 0.02 μm(Fig. 1). The requirement of 100-fold higher concentrations of CaMN and CaMC for enzyme activation relative to that required for intact CaM indicates that the central helix facilitates binding and enzyme activation, in agreement with previous observations (37.Persechini A. Kretsinger R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12175-12178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38.Persechini A. Jarrett H.W. Kosk-Kosicka D. Krinks M.H. Lee H.G. Biochim. Biophys.

The approximately 4-fold lower concentration of CaMC necessary for half-maximal activation using a combination of CaMC and CaMN relative to that observed using CaMC alone is consistent with previous suggestions that the carboxyl- and amino-terminal domains of CaM may have different specificities for the two CaM-binding sites within the CaM-binding sequence of the PM Ca-ATPase (13.Chapman E.R. Alexander K. Vorherr T. Carafoli E. Storm D.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12819-12825Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To further understand possible differences in the individual domains of CaM in the activation mechanism of the Ca-ATPase, additional measurements of possible differences in binding specificity are necessary.Table IEquilibrium binding affinities between CaM domains and the plasma membrane Ca-ATPaseCaM sequence[CaM]1/2k 1k 2k 3mm −1m −1m −1CaM (Ala1–Lys148)3.9 × 10−91.0 × 108NAaNA, not applicable.∼1 × 105bEstimated affinity based on correction of apparent binding constant (k 3b = 5 ± 4 × 109m−1) for the effective volume available to the amino- terminal domain following association of the carboxyl-terminal domain (see Equation 4).(0.4 × 10−9)(0.1 × 108)CaMN (Ala1–Lys77)6 × 10−61 × 104cAssumes that CaMN has the same affinity for sites A and B (i.e. k 1 = k 2 andk 3 = k 4 in Scheme II).NA3.2 × 106cAssumes that CaMN has the same affinity for sites A and B (i.e. k 1 = k 2 andk 3 = k 4 in Scheme II).(1 × 10−6)(1 × 104)(0.5 × 106)CaMC (Asp78–Lys148)1.7 × 10−6<1.0 × 108>dParameter value based on binding affinity of carboxyl-terminal domain determined for CaM.0.7 × 106ek a = 1.1 ± 0.1 × 106m−1 using Equation 7.NA(0.2 × 10−6)(0.1 × 106)CaMN + CaMC0.4 × 10−6<1.0 × 108>dParameter value based on binding affinity of carboxyl-terminal domain determined for CaM.<0.7 × 106>fParameter value based on activation of PM-Ca-ATPase using CaMC.2.7 × 106gk a = 2.8 ± 0.2 × 106m−1 using Equation 7.(0.1 × 10−6)(0.3 × 106)Equilibrium association constants were derived from macroscopic equilibrium constants obtained from fitting data in Fig. 1 to Equation2 (CaM), Equation 8 (CaMN), Equation 6 (CaMC), and Equation 9(CaMN + CaMC), where relationships between derived binding constants and the mechanisms of CaM association are illustrated in Schemes I and II.

https://openalex.org/W2078814797,"We have generated protein chimeras to investigate the role of the fourth transmembrane segments (TM4) of the Na,K- and gastric H,K-ATPases in determining the distinct cation selectivities of these two pumps. Based on a helical wheel analysis, three residues of TM4 of the Na,K-ATPase were changed to their H,K-counterparts. A construct carrying three mutations in TM4 (L319F, N326Y, and T340S) and two control constructs were heterologously expressed inXenopus laevis oocytes and in the pig kidney epithelial cell line LLC-PK1. Biochemical ATPase assays demonstrated a large sodium-independent ATPase activity at pH 6.0 for the pump carrying the TM4 substitutions, whereas the control constructs exhibited little or no activity in the absence of sodium. Furthermore, at pH 6.0 the K ½(Na+) shifted to 1.5 mm for the TM4 construct compared with 9.4 and 5.9 mm for the controls. In contrast, at pH 7.5 all three constructs had characteristics similar to wild type Na,K-ATPase. Large increases in K ½(K+) were observed for the TM4 construct compared with the control constructs both in two-electrode voltage clamp experiments inXenopus oocytes and in ATPase assays. ATPase assays also revealed a 10-fold shift in vanadate sensitivity for the TM4 construct. Based on these findings, it appears that the three identified TM4 residues play an important role in determining both the specific cation selectivities and the E1/E2 conformational equilibria of the Na,K- and H,K-ATPase.

These molecules couple the energy liberated through ATP hydrolysis to the transmembrane translocation of cations. Much remains to be learned about the structural features of these pumps that determine their functional characteristics. In this study we take advantage of the high mechanistic and functional homology relating the gastric H,K-ATPase and the Na,K-ATPase to investigate the molecular basis for their distinct cation selectivity properties. Both enzymes form functional heterodimers consisting of a larger α-subunit (∼110 kDa) and a highly glycosylated β-subunit (∼35 kDa). For both enzymes, the structural determinants required for enzymatic function have been mapped to the α-subunits, whereas the β-subunits are required to ensure the structural integrity of the protein and for delivery of the heterodimeric pump complex to the plasma membrane (for review see Ref. 1.Moller J.V. Juul B. le Maire M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). The Na,K-ATPase is ubiquitous, whereas the gastric H,K-ATPase is primarily found in gastric parietal cells (2.Courtois-Coutry N. Roush D. Rajendran V. McCarthy J.B. Geibel J. Kashgarian M. Caplan M.J. Cell. 1997; 90: 501-510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), though it has been detected in the kidney as well (3.Doucet A. Exp. Nephrol. 1997; 5: 271-276PubMed Google Scholar). The α-subunits of these two P-type ATPases are 62% homologous, and their hydropathy plots are virtually identical. However, the proteins exhibit major functional differences. Whereas the Na,K-ATPase exports three Na+ ions from the cytoplasm to the extracellular side in exchange for two K+ ions, the H,K-ATPase secretes two protons in exchange for two potassium ions (1.Moller J.V. Juul B. le Maire M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). The high degree of similarity between the Na,K-ATPase and the gastric H,K-ATPase allows their functional determinants to be studied through the generation of chimeras. By exchanging sequence domains and analyzing the functional properties of the resultant chimeric proteins it is possible to identify protein segments that are critical for the different physiological properties of the pumps. We have previously reported that the N-terminal halves of the α-subunits of the Na,K- and H,K-ATPases in part determine their distinct ion specificities (4.Blostein R. Dunbar L.A. Mense M. Scanzano R. Wilczynska A. Caplan M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18374-18381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The N-terminal half of each α-subunit includes the first four transmembrane domains (TM1-TM4)1 as well as half of the large cytoplasmic loop connecting TM4 and TM5. To analyze this region further, a chimera was prepared in which the ectodomain between TM3 and TM4, the fourth transmembrane domain, and the N-terminal half of the large cytoplasmic loop between TM4 and TM5 (amino acids 309–506) 2In previous publications on Na,K-/H,K-ATPase chimeras, we have used a numbering system referring to the positions of gastric H,K-ATPase residues. To facilitate the comparison of the present results to other mutagenesis studies of the Na,K-ATPase, we have employed a numbering system based on the Na,K-ATPase sequence in this manuscript. It should be noted that the Na,K-ATPase amino acid residues 343–506 correspond to amino acids 356–519 of the H,K-ATPase in the chimera H85N/H356–519N (4.Blostein R. Dunbar L.A. Mense M. Scanzano R.

The chimera was transfected into polarized LLC-PK1 pig kidney epithelial cells and was found to accumulate at the apical plasma membrane. When these cells were grown on permeable filter supports, an ouabain-sensitive acidification of the medium bathing their apical surfaces was observed. 3L. A. Dunbar, P. Aronson, and M. J. Caplan, submitted for publication. 3L. A. Dunbar, P. Aronson, and M. J. Caplan, submitted for publication. These data suggest that residues in TM4 and/or its flanking sequences confer the capacity to mediate proton transport. We were not able to analyze the kinetic properties of this chimera, because we could not reliably detect chimera-associated ATPase activity. To define more precisely these amino residues that are critical for the cation selectivity, we have begun to characterize chimeras that have only portions of the Na,K-ATPase sequence between amino acids 309 and 506 replaced by their H,K-counterparts. Recently we have reported that a chimera comprising the Na,K-ATPase sequence in which the proximal half of the cytoplasmic loop (amino acids 343–506) is replaced by the corresponding H,K-ATPase sequence has an altered cation selectivity. In ATPase assays at pH 6.0 this chimera achieved 28% of its maximal activity without any added sodium in the assay solution, whereas there is no detectable sodium-independent activity for the wild type enzyme. This suggests that protons can substitute for Na+ ions in the catalytic cycle of the pump (4.Blostein R. Dunbar L.A. Mense M. Scanzano R. Wilczynska A. Caplan M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18374-18381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Extensive site-directed mutagenesis studies performed on the Na,K- and Ca-ATPase indicate that amino acid residues that reside in four of the predicted transmembrane domains (TM4, TM5, TM6, and TM8) make important contributions to cation binding. Each of these amphiphatic helices contains charged and polar residues whose side chains might be expected to participate in the formation of cation binding sites. Results from several labs indicate that mutations in the fourth transmembrane domain of the Ca-ATPase change this pump's apparent affinity for Ca2+ (for review see Ref. 6.Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. FEBS Lett. 1995; 359: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Comparable results have been obtained for the Na,K-ATPase. In the present study we dissect further the relevance to cation selectivity of selected TM4 residues together with the extracellular ectodomain (residues 309–342). The TM4s of the two pumps differ by only eight amino acid residues. We found that the replacement of only three Na,K-ATPase residues with their H,K-counterparts (L319F, N326Y, and T340S) has dramatic effects on pump function. These three mutations in TM4 together with the exchange of the ectodomains between TM3 and TM4 yield an ATPase, which at pH 6.0 achieves more than 50% of its maximal Na,K-ATPase activity in the absence of sodium. A control construct that only incorporated the ectodomain replacement but not the mutations in TM4 showed only 13% sodium-independent ATPase activity at pH 6.0. Our data suggest, therefore, that these three amino residues play an important role in determining the distinct cation selectivity properties of the Na,K- and H,K-ATPase. The chimeras presented in this paper were constructed between the rat Na,K-ATPase α1-subunit (cDNA provided by E. Benz, Johns Hopkins University) and the rat gastric H,K-ATPase α-subunit (cDNA provided by G. Shull, University of Cincinnati). The Kunkel method of site-directed mutagenesis was used to silently introduceApaI, AccI, and HpaI restriction sites into the two cDNAs. An ApaI site was created in the Na,K-ATPase to match the site existing in the H,K-ATPase at base pair 465 corresponding to amino acid 85. The AccI andHpaI sites corresponding to H,K-ATPase amino acids 329 and 356 were introduced into both cDNAs. Chimera H85N was generated by subcloning the small ApaI fragment of the H,K-ATPase into the larger ApaI fragment of the Na,K-ATPase. The ecto and ecto + A chimeras were constructed by ligating annealed synthetic oligonucleotides between theAccI and HpaI sites of the H85Nchimera. The oligonucleotide 5′-ATACCTTCCT TCGGGCTGTC ATCTTCCTCA TTGGTATCAT CGTAGCCAAC GTGCCGGAAG GTTTGCTAGC CACCGTCACG GTATGTCTGA CGTT-3′ and its complementary strand were used for the ectochimera. The oligonucleotide 5′-ATACCTTCCT TCGGGCCGTC ATCTTCTTCA TTGGTATTAT CGTAGCCTAT GTGCCTGAGG GGCTGCTAGC TACTGTCACG GTCTGCCTGT CGTT-3′ and its complementary strand were used for the ecto + A chimera. Construction of the chimeras took place in either the pBluescript or pSP72 vector (Promega Corp, Madison, WI). Once the chimeras were sequenced through their ligation points, they were subcloned into expression vectors suitable for the different expression systems. For expression in Xenopus oocytes the cDNAs encoding the constructs were excised from pBluescript using the ClaI andXbaI restriction sites and ligated into a modified pBluesript vector using ClaI and SpeI sites. The modified pBluescript vector, enhanced for Xenopus oocyte expression, was kindly provided by William Joiner, Yale University. The polylinker of the vector is flanked by the 5′- and 3′-untranslated region sequences of Xenopus β-globin. This modification has been shown to boost mRNA stability and expression levels inXenopus oocytes (7.Krieg P.A. Melton D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2331-2335Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The 5′-untranslated region is inserted between the KpnI and the ApaI sites of the pBluescript-KS vector. The 3′-untranslated region plus a poly(A) sequence was ligated into the vector using the BstEII site and the BsmI site. For in vitro transcription of the chimera cDNAs, the vector was linearized with XbaI, which cuts downstream from the poly(A) sequence. An Ambion T3 mMessage-mMachine kit was used for the transcription reaction. Oocytes were obtained and treated according to standard methods (8.Fyfe G.K. Canessa C.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 423-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar).Xenopus oocytes were injected with 50 nl of cRNA solution containing a total of 16 ng of α-subunit and 12 ng of Na,K-ATPase β1-subunit RNA. Oocytes were maintained in ND96 medium supplemented with 5 mm pyruvate and 50 μg/ml gentamycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). They were used for experiments on day 3 or 4 postinjection. For expression in LLC-PK1 cells, the chimeric cDNAs were subcloned behind a cytomegalovirus promoter in the mammalian expression vector pCB6 (kindly provided by M. Roth, University of Texas Southwestern), which carries resistance to the antibiotic G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Transfection, antibiotic selection, screening for expression, and ouabain selection were carried out as described in Ref.4.Blostein R. Dunbar L.A. Mense M. Scanzano R. Wilczynska A. Caplan M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18374-18381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar. Electrophysiological measurements of pump currents were performed essentially as described by Horisbergeret al. (9.Horisberger J.D. Jaunin P. Good P.J. Rossier B.C. Geering K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8397-8400Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) with the following minor modifications. Prior to measurements, oocytes were loaded with sodium by incubating them for 2 h at room temperature in a K+- and Ca2+-free medium (97 mm Na+, 0.82 mm Mg2+, 0.5 mm EGTA, 22.5 mm Cl−, 76 mm gluconate, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4). They were subsequently incubated for 15 min in potassium-free bath solution (97 mm Na+, 0.82 mm Mg2+, 0.42 mmCa2+, 5 mm Ba2+, 22.5 mm Cl−, 76 mm gluconate, 2 μm ouabain, and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4). This solution contains barium to block nonspecific potassium currents and 2 μm ouabain to inhibit endogenous XenopusNa,K-ATPase. Finally, oocytes were placed in the chamber of the voltage clamp setup, which initially contained the same potassium-free bath solution. Whole cell currents were measured at a holding potential of −50 mV in the following manner: after the baseline had stabilized with the oocyte in the potassium-free bath, the solution was exchanged for a potassium-containing solution, and the potassium-induced current was recorded. The potassium-free and potassium-containing solutions differed only by the replacement of a fraction of the Na+ions with K+ ions. The total concentration of Na+ and K+ was always 97 mm. To ensure that the observed current was pump-mediated, it was suppressed by replacing the potassium-containing solution with an identical solution to which 5 mm ouabain had been added. The data were obtained using a Warner Instruments Oocyte-Clamp 725C (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT) and analyzed with Pulse and Pulsfit software from HEKA (Darmstadt, Germany). The pump currents were plotted against the corresponding potassium concentrations and fitted to the Hill equation, I=Imax/{1+(K1/2i/[K+]) n}Equation 1 where I max is the maximal or saturated current, K ½i is the half activation constant for the ionic current, [K+] is the potassium concentration in the bath, and n is the Hill coefficient. The following procedure was performed entirely on ice. It has been modified from the method published by Vilsen (10.Vilsen B. FEBS Lett. 1992; 314: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). After LLC-PK1 cells were grown to confluence in 10-cm tissue culture dishes, they were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. They were harvested by scraping with a rubber policeman into 500 μl of a solution containing 250 mm sucrose, 20 mm Tris·HCl, and 1 mm EDTA at pH 7.5. The cells were then sonicated for 1 min using a Branson Sonifier 250 (Branson, Danbury, CT) at an amplitude of 30% on constant duty cycle. The sonicated membranes were spun in a Beckman tabletop centrifuge at 3000 × g for 10 min. The pellet was discarded, and the supernatant was combined with an equal volume of a solution of 1 m NaI, 5 mmMgCl2, 20 mm EDTA, and 160 mm Tris at pH 8.3. This membrane suspension was incubated for 10 min on ice before the membranes were pelleted by ultracentrifugation at 48,000 × g for 90 min. The supernatant was aspirated, and the pellet was resuspended and washed in a sodium-free Tris-EDTA solution (10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4). The membranes were pelleted a second time by ultracentrifugation and resuspended in the same sodium-free Tris-EDTA solution. To homogenize the membrane suspension it was again sonicated for 30 s before the yield was determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay. The membranes were frozen at −80 °C until they were used for experiments. ATPase assays were carried out using a colorimetric procedure for measuring inorganic phosphate released from ATP (11.Jorgensen P.L. Petersen J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 705: 38-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 12.Ottolenghi P. Biochem. J. 1975; 151: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Prior to the assay (except potassium-free assay, see below), the crude plasma membranes were permeabilized by incubation in 0.65 mg/ml deoxycholic acid, 2 mm EDTA, and 20 mm imidazole for 30 min at room temperature. Assays were initiated by adding 25 μl of the membrane suspension to a 475-μl assay solution containing 3 mm MgCl2, 3 mm Tris-ATP, 25 mm imidazole. For sodium titration experiments the assay solutions also contained 20 mm KCl, NaCl, andN-methyl-d-glucamine (NMDG). The combined concentration of NaCl and NMDG was maintained constant at 130 mm to ensure constant ionic strength. For pH titration experiments, the assay solutions contained 20 mm KCl and either 130 mm NMDG or 60 mm NaCl and 70 mm NMDG. For vanadate titration experiments the assay solutions contained 20 mm KCl, 60 mm NaCl, and 70 mm NMDG. The assay solutions for potassium titration experiments contained 100 mm NaCl, KCl, and NMDG, and the combined concentration of the latter two ions was constant at 30 mm. To ensure that each assay measured similar levels of ATPase activity, different amounts of protein were added to the assay medium, depending upon the chimera being tested and the pH of the assay medium. Protein additions were adjusted so that during 2 h of incubation at 37 °C at least 4%, but no more than 10% of the total ATP (3 mm), would be hydrolyzed under V maxconditions. Thus, typical total protein added for pH 7.5 assays was 5–8 mg/test tube for H85N and 8–12 mg for ectoand ecto+A. At pH 6.0 the total protein was increased by 50–100% for each chimera. After 2 h of incubation the reaction was stopped by adding 1 ml of ice-cold stop solution (0.5 mHCl, 3% ascorbic acid, 0.5% ammonium molybdate, and 1% SDS), which was always freshly prepared. All tubes were then transferred to an ice-cold water bath, and 1.5 ml of a solution with 2% sodium meta-arsenite, 2% sodium citrate, and 2% acetic acid was added to each tube. For color development of the phosphate assay the test tubes were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. Free inorganic phosphate was determined by reading the optical density for each test tube at 850 nm on a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 3B spectrophotometer. In every experiment each data point was measured in triplicate, and the chimera-specific ATPase activity was determined as the signal difference from tubes containing either 10 μm (to inhibit endogenous Na,K-ATPase) or 5 mm ouabain. Sodium orthovanadate (Sigma) was prepared as an ∼10 mmstock solution at pH 9.0. Prior to the experiments an aliquot was boiled for at least three minutes, and the vanadate concentration was determined spectrophotometrically at λ 268 nm (13.Gordon J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Individual experiments were carried out in triplicates. They were averaged and normalized to the maximal enzymatic activity (V max), which was computed by fitting the data to a Hill function, V = V max/{1 + (K ½(X+)/[X+]) n }. Each individual experiment was performed at least three times. The data of the individual experiments were averaged and again fitted to the Hill function. The values shown are the means of at least three experiments, and the error bars correspond to the standard deviation between the values obtained in individual experiments. The data are presented as percentage of maximal activity (V max). The apparent K 1/2values were also obtained from the same data fits. Membranes were first permeabilized in a solution containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.65 mg/ml SDS in 15 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, for 10 min at room temperature, after which they were diluted 50-fold with 0.3% bovine serum albumin (14.Forbush B.D. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 128: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The permeabilized membranes were then pretreated for 10 min at 37 °C with 0.5 volume of a solution comprising either 10 mm or 13.3 μm ouabain in 26.7 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 26.7 mm EGTA-Tris, 16 mm MgSO4, and 5.34 mm EDTA-Tris. The assay was initiated by adding a 0.25 volume [γ-32P]ATP and NaCl (final concentrations, 1 μm and 2 mm, respectively) containing the indicated final concentrations of vanadate. Assays were carried out as described by Daly et al. (15.Daly S.E. Lane L.K. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23944-23948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and values shown are the differences in the averages of two sets of triplicates, the one set with low (5 μm) ouabain and the other with high (5 mm) ouabain. As discussed in the introduction, the portion of the Na,K-ATPase α-subunit residing between TM3 and the fluorescein isothiocyanate binding site (residues 309–506) appears to be important in determining cation selectivity. We have previously shown that a portion of this selectivity is attributable to the sequence domain bounded by amino acids 343 and 506, which constitutes roughly half of the large cytoplasmic loop connecting transmembrane segments 4 and 5 (Fig. 2 A). The goal of this study is to further elucidate the role of residues 309–342 of the Na,K-ATPase in determining the cation selectivity properties of the pump. These residues comprise the ectodomain between TM3 and TM4 and all of TM4. Initially, a chimera was generated that had amino acids 309–342 exchanged for the corresponding sequence from the H,K-ATPase α-subunit (Fig. 2 A). Although this construct assembles with the β-subunit and is delivered to the cell surface, no enzymatic activity could be detected (data not shown). We chose, therefore, to generate new pump constructs incorporating more narrowly defined substitutions. Extensive mutagenesis studies have demonstrated that specific residues of the Ca-ATPase, which is structurally and functionally homologous to both the Na,K- and H,K-ATPase α-subunits, play a role in cation binding. Fig. 1 A depicts helical wheel representations of the TM4s of the Na,K- and H,K-ATPase. Residues marked with asterisks correspond to the positions of the five Ca-ATPase amino acids (Ala-305, Ala-306, Glu-309, Gly-310, and Pro-312), which have been shown to play a role in calcium translocation (6.Andersen J.P.

Sci. 1992; 671: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that all five residues are predicted to lie on the same helical face. It would appear, therefore, that TM4 has two domains or faces, one of which is likely to be directed toward the presumed ion translocation pore, whereas the other may face the surrounding lipid domain or adjoining helices. These two putative faces are separated by a dashed line (Fig.1 A). Fig. 1 B shows a sequence alignment of the TM4s of the Na,K- and H,K-ATPase α-subunits. The TM4s of Na,K- and H,K-ATPase differ at only eight amino acid positions marked by the solid black letters. Of these eight residues, only Leu-319, Asn-326, and Thr-340 of the sodium pump are located in the domain that faces the putative ion translocation pore (Fig. 1 A). We have hypothesized, therefore, that these three residues might be intimately involved in establishing the distinct cation selectivities of the Na,K- and H,K-pumps. To test this possibility, construct ecto + A(Fig. 2 B) was generated, which had these three TM4 residues mutated to their H,K-counterparts (L319F, N326Y, and T340S), and includes the ectodomain between TM3 and TM4. This ectodomain replacement resulted in two amino acid replacements compared with the sodium pump sequence, W312F, and E314R (Fig.2 C). To control for a contribution of the ectodomain the construct ecto was produced, which had only the ectodomain replaced with its H,K-ATPase counterpart (Fig. 2 B). Finally, for both constructs the first 72 amino acids of the Na,K-ATPase were replaced with the corresponding H,K-ATPase sequence, which consists of 85 amino acids. An antibody specific to this epitope allows us to distinguish the chimeric constructs, expressed in LLC-PK1 cells or Xenopus oocytes, from endogenous Na,K-ATPase. Previous studies demonstrated that this swap does not alter the functional properties of the Na,K-ATPase (4.Blostein R. Dunbar L.A. Mense M. Scanzano R. Wilczynska A. Caplan M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18374-18381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Thus, construct H85N, which had only the N-terminal replacement, was used as the “wild type” control throughout the study (Fig.2). A two-electrode voltage clamp of oocytes fromXenopus laevis was used to assess whether the chimeric constructs catalyze electrogenic ion fluxes. We took advantage of the species-dependent differences in ouabain sensitivity of the Na,K-ATPase to distinguish current driven by the exogenous recombinant pumps from that mediated by the endogenous sodium pumps of the oocytes. Because the α1-isoform from rat (K i ∼ 10−4m) was used for the construction of all our chimeras, we could inhibit the endogenous Na,K-ATPase (K i ∼ 10−7m) with a low concentration of ouabain (2 μm) without affecting chimera activity. Under conditions that inhibited the background potassium currents in the oocytes, all three constructs were able to produce a potassium-activated outward current (Fig.3, A–C). This current could be inhibited by adding 5 mm ouabain, and as expected, the ouabain block was reversible. We also used this system to determine the apparent affinities of the chimeric pumps for K+. Clamping the oocytes at a holding potential of −50 mV, we stepwise increased the potassium concentration of the bath solution and recorded the current response (Fig. 3 D). The observed plateau currents were plotted versus the corresponding potassium concentration. The resulting potassium activation curves allowed computation of the apparent K ½ values. Averaging over four to six different oocytes for each construct and fitting the data to a Hill function, we found thatK ½(K+) = 5.6 mm for ecto + A, whereasK ½(K+) = 0.56 mm andK ½(K+) = 1.16 mm for the controls H85N and ecto, respectively. Hill coefficients were between 1.5 and 1.7 for all three constructs. The K ½ of 5.6 mm for ecto + A represents only a lower estimate, because the highest K+ concentration employed did not yield a saturated current. The K ½value for H85N corresponds well to what has been reported earlier for the wild type sodium pump under similar ionic conditions (10.Vilsen B. FEBS Lett. 1992; 314: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 17.Kuntzweiler T.A. Wallick E.T. Johnson C.L. Lingrel J.B J. Biol.

For all of the following experiments crude plasma membranes from stably transfected LLC-PK1 cells were used. The LLC-PK1 cell line is derived from pig kidney. Pig Na,K-ATPase α1 has a K i for ouabain of approximately 10−7m, whereas the rat-α1, which was used for our constructs, is only slightly affected by this low concentration of ouabain (K i ∼ 10−4m). Thus, at all times the assay solutions contained a low concentration of ouabain (10 μm), which is sufficient to inhibit the endogenous but not the exogenous Na,K-ATPase. We assessed the Na+ dependence of the ATPase activity of our constructs. The sodium titration experiments were performed both at pH 7.5 and at pH 6. At pH 7.5 the apparent sodium affinities for all three constructs were not significantly different f"

However, in almost all cells PTH potentiated the response to carbachol by about 3-fold. Responses to carbachol did not desensitize, but only the first challenge in Ca2+-free medium caused an increase in [Ca2+]i, indicating that the carbachol-sensitive Ca2+ stores had been emptied. Subsequent addition of PTH also failed to increase [Ca2+]i, but when it was followed by carbachol there was a substantial increase in [Ca2+]i. A similar potentiation was observed between ATP and PTH but not between carbachol and ATP. Intracellular heparin inhibited responses to carbachol and PTH, and pretreatment with ATP and carbachol abolished responses to PTH, suggesting that the effects of PTH involve inositol trisphosphate (IP3) receptors. PTH neither stimulated detectable IP3 formation nor affected the amount formed in response to ATP or carbachol. PTH stimulated cyclic AMP formation, but this was not the means whereby PTH potentiated Ca2+ signals. We suggest that PTH may regulate Ca2+ mobilization by facilitating translocation of Ca2+ between discrete intracellular stores and that it thereby regulates the size of the Ca2+ pool available to receptors linked to IP3 formation.

The ability of PTH to activate two signaling pathways was generally assumed to result from its interaction with the two receptor subtypes, an assumption that gained support from the observation that the two pathways could be differentially stimulated by truncated forms of PTH (8.Fujimori A.

Previous experiments established that with this loading protocol, >95% of the Fura-2 fluorescence came from Fura-2 that was both cytosolic and hydrolyzed to its Ca2+-sensitive form (17.Hargreaves A.C. Lummis S.C.R. Taylor C.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 1120-1128PubMed Google Scholar). Single cell fluorescence imaging at 21 °C using IonVision software, corrections for background fluorescence, and calibration of fluorescence ratios (R 340/380) to [Ca2+]i were performed as described previously (17.Hargreaves A.C. Lummis S.C.R. Taylor C.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 1120-1128PubMed Google Scholar). For microinjection with heparin, Fura-2-loaded cells bathed in nominally Ca2+-free ECM were injected with medium (27 mmK2HPO4, 8 mmNaH2PO4, 26 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.3) containing 10 mg/ml heparin and 1 mg/ml Cascade Blue as a marker for microinjected cells (18.Broad L.M. Cannon T.R. Taylor C.W. J. Physiol. 1999; 517: 121-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). After 30 min, cells were restored to Ca2+-containing ECM prior to measurement of [Ca2+]i. Confluent cultures of HEK/PTH-R1 cells in 6-well plates were preincubated in ECM containing 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (1 mm, 30 min). Agonists were then added, and the incubations were terminated after 10 min by the removal of the medium and the addition of cold 0.1 m HCl in 65% methanol (750 μl). After 30 min on ice, the contents of the wells were scraped, washed (750 μl acidified methanol) into tubes, and centrifuged (1000 × g, 30 min). The supernatants were dried under vacuum (60 °C, 4 h) and stored at −80 °C. A commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit using the nonacetylation protocol specified by the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used to determine the cyclic AMP contents of the samples. HEK/PTH-R1 cells (2.5 × 106 cells/ml) plated onto poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips were grown for 48 h in inositol-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2% fetal calf serum andd-myo-[2-3H] inositol (2 μCi/ml). Cells were washed twice in ECM and incubated for 15 s with the appropriate agents at 21 °C. Reactions were stopped by aspiration and addition of 0.5 ml of 1 mm ice-cold perchloric acid and kept on ice for 30 min. Acid extracts were neutralized and then loaded onto anion exchange columns from which the [3H]IP3 fraction was eluted (18.Broad L.M. Cannon T.R. Taylor C.W. J. Physiol. 1999; 517: 121-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). For most experiments, responses from 25–30 single cells on a coverslip were averaged. Statistical analyses were applied to the average results derived from independent measurements from several coverslips, where the sample size refers to the number of coverslips. Concentration-effect relationships were fitted to four-parameter logistic equations using least squares curve-fitting routines (Kaleidagraph, Synergy Software). Stimulation of the endogenous muscarinic receptors of HEK 293 cells with carbachol (100 μm) evoked an increase in [Ca2+]i irrespective of whether the cells had been transfected with PTH receptors (Fig.1, A–C). PTH (1 μm), however, stimulated an increase in [Ca2+]i only in HEK/PTH-R1 cells, and, in keeping with previous reports comparing PTH with agonists that stimulate IP3 formation (9.Tong Y. Zull J. Yu L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8183-8191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 15.Babich M. Choi H. Johnson R.M. King K.L. Alford G.E. Nissenson R.A.

Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 5282-5292Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), the maximal response to PTH was only 21 ± 5% (n = 7) of that evoked by carbachol (Fig. 1 B). In one previous study (19.Jobert A.-S. Leroy C. Butlen D. Silve C. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 5282-5292Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) but not in others (10.Seuwen K. Boddeke H.G.W.M. Br.

Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 1713-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), it was claimed that HEK 293 cells express type 1 PTH receptors. Our results are consistent with most previous work in demonstrating that PTH evokes Ca2+ mobilization in HEK 293 cells only after transfection with type 1 PTH receptors (Fig. 1). Although the sustained phase of the Ca2+ signal evoked by carbachol and the peak amplitudes of the responses evoked by PTH or carbachol were reduced by removal of extracellular Ca2+(Fig. 1, B and C), both agonists consistently evoked an increase in [Ca2+]i in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 1 C), and responses to both were abolished after pretreatment with thapsigargin in Ca2+-free ECM (not shown). We conclude that both PTH and carbachol stimulate release of intracellular Ca2+ stores. Subsequent experiments addressed the mechanisms responsible for this Ca2+ mobilization. Single cell analyses of HEK/PTH-R1 cells revealed that whereas 96 ± 5% (n = 12 coverslips) of cells responded to carbachol (100 μm) with an increase in [Ca2+]i, only 27 ± 20% of cells responded to PTH (100 nm). In those cells that responded to PTH, the peak increase in [Ca2+]i was 84 ± 16% (n = 11) of that evoked by carbachol in the same cells (Fig. 1 D). Single cell analyses of HEK/PTH-R1 cells were used for all subsequent experiments (see “Experimental Procedures”). The magnitude of the responses to maximal concentrations of carbachol and PTH varied between experiments, although the relative amplitudes of the responses to the two stimuli were maintained. For each cell, we therefore expressed all responses as percentages of the response evoked by carbachol (100 μm) in normal ECM at the beginning of the experiment. After stimulation with carbachol in normal ECM, cells were allowed to recover for 5 min. Further stimulation then evoked indistinguishable responses; the peak increases in [Ca2+]i were 93 ± 6% (n = 3) and 94 ± 8% (n = 3) of the initial response after the second and third stimulation with carbachol, indicating that responses to carbachol do not desensitize. In subsequent experiments, changes in [Ca2+]i are expressed relative to the initial carbachol response recorded in normal ECM. PTH (100 nm) alone stimulated Ca2+ mobilization from only a fraction (27 ± 20%) of HEK/PTH-R1 cells, but it caused an increase in [Ca2+]i in most cells (86 ± 12%,n = 12 coverslips) when added immediately after carbachol (100 μm) (Fig.2 B). From the average responses of each cell in the field, the peak rise in [Ca2+]i evoked by PTH after carbachol was more than 10-fold greater than that evoked by PTH alone (160 ± 10%,n = 13; and 12 ± 7%, n = 11, respectively) (Fig. 2 C). The interaction between PTH and carbachol was also evident when cells were first stimulated with PTH and then with carbachol; the peak rise in [Ca2+]ievoked by carbachol alone was 71 ± 8% (n = 13) of the initial response, and after pretreatment with PTH it increased to 245 ± 10% (n = 8) (Fig. 2, A andC). Similar results were obtained in Ca2+-containing ECM (Fig. 2 C). PTH increased both the maximal amplitude and the sensitivity of the response to carbachol (Fig.3 A). The half-maximal effect (EC50) of carbachol was reduced from 71 ± 6 μm (n = 3) in control cells to 25 ± 3 μm (n = 3) in the presence of PTH. The EC50 for the effect of PTH in potentiating responses to carbachol (100 μm) was 7.8 ± 0.5 nm(Fig. 3 B). Because most HEK/PTH-R1 cells respond to PTH after carbachol pretreatment, whereas untransfected cells are unresponsive, we conclude that even though few HEK/PTH-R1 cells respond directly to PTH alone, most express functional PTH receptors. Carbachol unmasks a latent ability of PTH to stimulate release of intracellular Ca2+stores, and PTH increases by 2–3 fold the Ca2+mobilization evoked by carbachol, which alone stimulates Ca2+ mobilization in all cells. Potentiation of the responses to carbachol by PTH occurred despite [Ca2+]i having returned to its basal level (Fig.2 A), indicating that an increase in [Ca2+]i is not directly responsible for the effect. In Ca2+-free ECM, carbachol caused a transient increase in [Ca2+]i in HEK/PTH-R1 cells, but subsequent challenges with carbachol failed to increase [Ca2+]i, consistent with the first stimulation having fully emptied the carbachol-sensitive Ca2+ stores (Fig. 4 A). PTH alone also failed to increase [Ca2+]i, when added 5 min after carbachol had been removed (Fig. 4 A). However, a further challenge with carbachol after addition of PTH evoked a large transient increase in [Ca2+]i, equivalent to 135 ± 15% (n = 3) of a standard response to carbachol (Fig. 4 A). We conclude that PTH allows carbachol to release intracellular Ca2+ stores that would otherwise be insensitive to carbachol. Similar results were obtained when the order of addition of carbachol and PTH was reversed. PTH caused a substantial mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ stores when added immediately after carbachol had been removed, even though the carbachol itself evoked no increase in [Ca2+]ibecause the carbachol-sensitive Ca2+ stores had already been emptied by prior stimulation (Fig. 4 B). ATP also stimulates IP3 formation and Ca2+ mobilization in HEK/PTH-R1 cells; the Ca2+mobilization evoked by 10 μm ATP was 74 ± 5% (n = 7) of the standard carbachol response (Fig.5 A). Although only 71 ± 7% (n = 6) of cells responded to ATP, in the responsive cells the synergistic interaction with PTH was again evident. PTH added immediately after removal of ATP caused a substantial increase in [Ca2+]i; the response to PTH was 160 ± 30% (n = 4) of the standard carbachol response (Fig. 5 A). When PTH was added first, the increase in [Ca2+]i evoked by subsequent addition of ATP was increased to 159 ± 28% (n = 3) of the standard carbachol response (Fig. 5 B). There was no synergistic interaction between ATP and carbachol (not shown). Carbachol did not increase the fraction of cells that responded to ATP (73 ± 11% before carbachol, and 74 ± 4% after carbachol,n = 4), and in cells that responded to both stimuli, the increase in [Ca2+]i evoked by combined application of carbachol and ATP (198 ± 5%) was similar to the sum of the responses evoked by either agonist alone (71 ± 5 and 97 ± 35% for carbachol and ATP, respectively). Responses to IP3 are positively cooperative (22.Marchant J.S. Taylor C.W. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 510-518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). PTH might therefore have potentiated responses to carbachol and ATP by either directly stimulating formation of a subthreshold level of IP3 or by increasing the amount of IP3 made in response to ATP or carbachol. Neither explanation seems likely because PTH (10 μm) neither directly stimulated detectable IP3 formation (100 ± 23% of control,n = 6) nor affected the amount made in response to ATP (174 ± 23 and 166 ± 14% in the absence and presence of PTH) or carbachol (246 ± 31 and 266 ± 34%). Ca2+ stimulates IP3 receptors (22.Marchant J.S. Taylor C.W. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 510-518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), but this cannot explain the ability of PTH to potentiate responses to carbachol and ATP because the potentiation occurred without an increase in [Ca2+]i (Figs. 2, 4, and 5). Xestospongin, which has been shown to block cerebellar IP3receptors (23.Gafni J. Munsch J.A. Lam T.H. Catlin M.C. Costa L.G. Molinski T.F. Pessah I.N. Neuron. 1997; 19: 723-733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar), proved not to be useful in resolving the involvement of IP3 receptors in the response to PTH. A range of concentrations (10–50 μm) and preincubation periods (10–40 min) failed to separate direct effects of Xestospongin on the emptying of intracellular Ca2+ stores from inhibition of IP3 receptors (not shown) (18.Broad L.M. Cannon T.R. Taylor C.W. J. Physiol. 1999; 517: 121-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Two lines of evidence are, however, consistent with IP3 receptors mediating the enhanced Ca2+ release evoked by ATP or carbachol with PTH. First, and in contrast with a previous report (10.Seuwen K. Boddeke H.G.W.M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 114: 1613-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), microinjected heparin (10 mg/ml in the injection pipette) was similarly effective in blocking both the PTH- and carbachol-evoked increase in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 6). Second, after combined application of ATP and carbachol to release the IP3-sensitive Ca2+ stores, the subsequent response to PTH was almost abolished (down from 160 ± 10 to 25 ± 22%, n = 7). A plausible explanation for these observations is that PTH generates a signal that causes IP3 receptors to become more sensitive to IP3. The increase in [Ca2+]ievoked by PTH alone in some cells might then result from a sufficient basal level of IP3 to cause Ca2+ mobilization from sensitized IP3 receptors. The effects of PTH were persistent; even 10 min after removal of PTH, enhanced increases in [Ca2+]i were observed after carbachol addition (not shown); and this presumably reflects the slow dissociation of PTH from its high affinity receptor (3.Abou-Samra A.-B. Jüppner H. Force T. Freeman M.W. Kong X.-F. Schipani E. Urena P. Richards J. Boneventre J.V. Potts J.T. Kronenberg H.M. Segre G.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2732-2736Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar). However, the ability of carbachol to enhance the rise in [Ca2+]i evoked by PTH was short-lived and reversed within the ∼10 s taken for the three washes required to completely remove the carbachol-containing medium, in keeping with the relatively low affinity of muscarinic receptors for carbachol and the rapid metabolism of IP3. PTH stimulates adenylyl cyclase activity in HEK 293 cells with an EC50 of 20 ± 7 nm(n = 3; not shown); cyclic AMP might therefore have mediated the increases in [Ca2+]i evoked by PTH. Cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) phosphorylates IP3 receptors, and, although the functional consequences differ between cell types, in hepatocytes, which like HEK 293 cells express largely type 2 IP3 receptors (24.Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11678-11683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), phosphorylation increases the sensitivity of IP3 receptors to IP3 (25.Bird G. St J. Burgess G.M. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17917-17923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Forskolin was previously shown not to mimic the effects of activating type 1 PTH receptors on [Ca2+]i (10.Seuwen K. Boddeke H.G.W.M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 114: 1613-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), but forskolin (5 μm) alone only very modestly increased intracellular cyclic AMP (from 0.53 ± 0.05 to 0.91 ± 0.13 pmol/well, n = 3) relative to the increase evoked by PTH (to 3.04 ± 0.05 pmol/well). Similarly modest effects of forskolin on the endogenous adenylyl cyclase activity of HEK 293 cells has been reported previously (26.Wayman G.A. Hinds T.R. Storm D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 270: 24108-24115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, several additional lines of evidence demonstrate that neither cyclic AMP nor PKA mediate the effects of PTH on intracellular Ca2+ stores. First, pretreatment with 8-bromo cyclic AMP (50 μm, 5 min) reduced the Ca2+mobilization evoked by carbachol (Fig.7 A). Second, pretreatment of HEK/PTH-R1 cells with either of two inhibitors of PKA,Rp-8-Br-cAMPS (20 μm, 15 min) (27.Gjertsen B.T. Mellgren G. Otten A. Maronide E. Genieser H.-G. Jastorff B. Vintermyr O.K. McKnight G.S. Doskeland S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20599-20607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) or H89 (5 μm, 10 min) (28.Chijiwa T. Mishima A. Hagiwara M. Sano M. Hayashi K. Inoue T. Toshioka T. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5267-5272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), affected neither the response to PTH alone nor its ability to potentiate the response to carbachol (Fig.7 B). That these inhibitors had effectively blocked activation of PKA is confirmed by their ability to reverse the inhibition of carbachol-evoked Ca2+ mobilization caused by 8-bromo-cAMP (Fig. 7 A). Third, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, which by inhibiting cyclic AMP degradation would be expected to potentiate responses to PTH if they were mediated by cyclic AMP, had the opposite effect. Pretreatment with 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (1 mm, 20 min) abolished the potentiation of carbachol responses by either submaximal (6 nm) or maximal (100 nm) concentrations of PTH (not shown). We conclude that the ability of PTH to potentiate carbachol-evoked Ca2+mobilization is not mediated by cAMP. Indeed PKA, by a mechanism that we have not addressed further, appears to cause desensitization of either muscarinic or PTH receptors. We conclude, in keeping with previous work (29.McCuaig K.A. Clarke J.C. White H.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5051-5055Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), that PTH-mediated Ca2+ mobilization does not result from production of IP3; PTH does not stimulate detectable formation of IP3, it has no detectable effect on the IP3 formation evoked by ATP or carbachol, and the lack of synergy between ATP and carbachol indicates that the IP3formed in response to these receptors is incapable of mimicking PTH. Nor are the potentiated Ca2+ signals evoked by PTH mediated by cyclic AMP (Fig. 7), by Ca2+-induced sensitization of IP3 receptors (Figs. 2, 4, and 5), or by phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase, because wortmannin (1 μm) did not prevent PTH from potentiating responses to carbachol (not shown). Our data are nevertheless consistent with IP3receptors being involved in responses to PTH (Fig. 6). We suggest that activation of type 1 PTH receptors stimulates formation of an intracellular messenger that allows more complete emptying of intracellular Ca2+ stores than is possible with maximal concentrations of either ATP or carbachol alone. To account for the larger maximal response to carbachol in the presence of PTH (Fig.3 A), we suggest that PTH may facilitate translocation of Ca2+ between discrete intracellular Ca2+ stores (Fig. 8), such that stores lacking IP3 receptors are brought into continuity with those expressing them. Such a model would account for the small amount of Ca2+ release evoked by PTH alone (triggered by basal levels of IP3) (Fig. 1 C), for the increase in the size of the pool released by maximal concentrations of carbachol or ATP (Figs. 4 and 5 B), and for the increased sensitivity of the stores to carbachol (Fig. 3 A)."

Recently this product has received attention because of a growing number of discovered biological functions such as regulation of GTPase-activating proteins (1.Cullen P.J. Hsuan J.J. Truong O. Letcher A.J. Jackson T.R. Dawson A.P. Irvine R.F.

Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 3-kinase (IP3K) is one of the few enzymes that bind InsP3 with high affinity and high selectivity. How this combination of affinity and selectivity is achieved by InsP3-binding proteins is largely unknown to date, as are the structural requirements for highly selective InsP3 binding. The most prominent InsP3-binding protein is the InsP3 receptor (IP3R), a tetrameric Ca2+channel residing in the endoplasmic reticulum, of which three isoenyzmes, types I-III, have been characterized on the cDNA level (4.Mignery G.A.

For the IP3R the InsP3binding domain has been confined to the amino-terminal 580 amino acids, with a minimal binding moiety of 353 amino acids (amino acids 226–578), displaying somewhat reduced affinity for InsP3(8.Yoshikawa F.

Particularly, three conserved basic amino acids have been pointed out by site-directed mutagenesis as being involved in ligand binding (8.Yoshikawa F. Morita M. Monkawa T. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18277-18284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Furthermore, photoaffinity labeling with InsP3 analogs identified a peptide comprising amino acids 476–501 of the IP3R as being part of the InsP3 binding site (9.Mourey R.J. Estevez V.A. Marecek J.F. Barrow R.K. Prestwich G.D. Snyder S.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1719-1726Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Besides the IP3R some members of a family of inositol polyphosphate/inositol phospholipid 5-phosphatases are also capable of binding to InsP3 with high affinity (for review, see Refs.10.Woscholski R. Parker P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 427-431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar and 11.Erneux C. Govaerts C. Communi D. Pesesse X. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 185-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). An InsP3 binding segment has been located in the catalytic domain of type II inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatases, with two short, highly conserved amino acid motifs (WXGDXNX R and PXWCDRXL) identified by mutational analysis as being involved in catalysis and/or substrate binding (12.Jefferson A.B. Majerus P.W. Biochemisty. 1996; 35: 7890-7894Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Particularly the arginine residue (Arg-480; bold above) was found to increase the enzyme's K m for InsP3, reflecting a reduced affinity for InsP3 (12.Jefferson A.B. Majerus P.W.

Two further proteins, which do not metabolize InsP3, have been found to bind it by experiments using photoaffinity analogs and specific affinity purification (13.Kanematsu T. Takeya H. Watanabe Y. Ozaki S. Yoshida M. Koga T. Iwanaga S. Hirata M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6518-6525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One of these proteins was identified by peptide sequencing as phospholipase Cδ1, and the other one was found to be closely related to phospholipase Cδ1, although lacking any detectable phospholipase C activity (14.Kanematsu T. Misumi Y. Watanabe Y. Ozaki S. Koga T. Iwanaga S. Ikehara Y. Hirata M. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 319-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Only for phospholipase Cδ1 the structural requirements for InsP3binding are already fairly well understood because the pleckstrin homology domain of this enzyme (amino acids 17–132) has been identified as the InsP3-binding element, and a crystal structure of this domain bound to InsP3 has been obtained (15.Ferguson K.M. Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1995; 83: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Within the NH2-terminal part of the pleckstrin homology domain (amino acids 17–60) five basic, one acidic, and one aromatic amino acid were identified as being directly involved in InsP3 binding (15.Ferguson K.M. Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1995; 83: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Two further basic amino acids within this protein segment were found to be indirectly involved in binding by site-directed mutation. IP3K is known as a highly selective InsP3-binding protein (16.Irvine R.F. Letcher A.J. Heslop J.P. Berridge M.J.

In the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans one gene for IP3K has been identified, which is alternatively spliced into three different mRNAs (27.Clandinin T. DeModena J. Sternberg P. Cell. 1998; 92: 523-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The catalytic domain of the enzyme has been mapped to the C terminus with the last 275 amino acids being indispensable for enzyme activity (28.Takazawa K. Erneux C. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 125-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This domain also shows the highest degree of amino acid conservation (30% identities) between isoforms and between species. Within this region Lys-197 and Asp-414 have been found to be involved in ATP binding in rat isoform A by site-directed mutagenesis (29.Communi D. Takazawa K. Erneux C. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 811-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). A recent study has gathered evidence for the involvement of one lysine residue (Lys-262) in rat isoform A (30.Togashi S. Takazawa K. Endo T. Erneux C. Onaya T. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) in InsP3binding. Here we demonstrate that in the chicken IP3K A-isoform a 35-amino acid region (amino acids 271–305) is protected against tryptic cleavage after InsP3 binding and that monoclonal antibodies recognizing epitopes within this region have inhibitory effects on the enzyme activity and interfere with InsP4 binding to the enzyme. Moreover, the enzymatic properties of recombinantly expressed mutant proteins clearly indicate the direct involvement in InsP3 binding of three residues (Arg-276 and Lys-303) within or close to this region (Arg-322) and a participation in binding of five neighbored residues, all lying within a 73-amino acid segment, centered in the catalytic domain. A bacterial expression vector, designated pGEX-SE1, was constructed by ligation of a 570-base pair fragment from a polymerase chain reaction product (polymerase chain reactions 5 and 4 (21.Bertsch U. Haefs M. Moller M. Deschermeier C. Fanick W. Kitzerow A. Ozaki S. Meyer H.E. Mayr G.W.

XL1 Blue bacteria transformed with pGEX-SE1 according to Ref. 31.Hanahan D. Glover D.M. DNA Cloning: A Practical Approach. IRL Press Ltd., Oxford1985: 109Google Scholar were used for overexpression of the GST-IP3K fusion protein (Pharmacia GST fusion kit). After 2 h of induction of protein expression by 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, the culture was centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 10 min. The bacterial pellet was resuspended in 1/30 of the culture volume of phosphate-buffered saline and frozen at −20 °C. The subsequently thawed bacterial suspension was subjected to lysis by addition of the following components at the respective final concentrations: 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme, 0.1 mg/ml DNase I, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dtt, and by incubation at 35 °C for 5 min followed by 20 min on ice. Fusion protein aggregated in inclusion bodies was pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The pellet was extracted once with 1/3 of the resuspension volume of detergent buffer (200 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-Cl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 1% deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40 at pH 7.5) and twice with the same volume of Triton buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmDTT, 0.5% Triton X-100 at pH 7.5) by vigorous vortexing for several minutes. The extracted pellet was solubilized in 1/3 of the resuspension volume of 8 m urea in water, centrifuged at 10,000 × g, and the supernatant dialyzed exhaustively against dialysis buffer (1 × phosphate-buffered saline, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100). Most of the fusion protein precipitated again during dialysis and was collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g. The pellet was solubilized again in 4 ml of 8 m urea and diluted 1:50 with dialysis buffer. The again dialyzed protein remained soluble and was supplemented with 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, gently mixed with 0.5 ml of glutathione-Sepharose resin and incubated for 40 min at room temperature under repeated mixing. The resin was washed on a column with 3 × 10 ml of dialysis buffer. The bound GST-IP3K fusion protein was eluted in three 1-ml fractions using elution buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, 10 mm glutathione, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 7.5). For these steps the resin was kept for 40, 15, and 15 min at room temperature in elution buffer, respectively. Monoclonal antibodies were produced according to the technique in Ref. 32.Köhler G. Milstein C. Nature. 1975; 256 (449): 495Crossref PubMed Scopus (12802) Google Scholar. A BALB/c mouse was injected on day 0 and day 15 intraperitoneally and subcutaneously with 10 μg of affinity-purified GST-IP3K fusion protein in complete and incomplete Freund's adjuvant, respectively. 53 days later the mouse was boosted with 100 μg of GST-IP3K fusion protein and 200 μg of double-stranded RNA intravenously and intraperitoneally. 3 days after the boost the splenocytes were fused with SP2/O myeloma cells. Plasmid pGEX-SE1 was modified for nested deletion of the IP3K coding fragment from its 3′-end by cleavage with AccI and TthIII and insertion of a double-stranded DNA fragment created from the complementary oligonucleotides ND1 (5′-CTCTAGAAAAGGTACCTGACTGACTGAACGT-3′) and ND2 (5′-TCAGTCAGTCAGGTACCTTTTCTAGA-3′) into the gap. The resulting plasmid pGEX-SE570 was cleaved with KpnI and XbaI and then subjected to a nested deletion reaction using the nested deletion kit of Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The reaction products were used to transform competent XL1 Blue cells (Stratagene), and the resulting transformants were screened by plasmid minipreparation and restriction enzyme digest for the length of the IP3K coding region. Several truncated plasmids were selected and dideoxynucleotide sequenced (33.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar) using an Applied Biosystems 377 automated Sequenator. Bacterial colonies harboring plasmids of interest were then cultured and induced for the expression of GST fusion proteins as described above. Lysates, prepared as described above, were directly used for SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. A 306-amino acid fragment of chicken comprising CaM binding and catalytic domain, designated IP3K147-C, as well as the derived mutant proteins were overexpressed in E. coliBL21(DE3) bacteria transformed with plasmid pEGIK or mutated derivates thereof and purified on phosphocellulose and CaM-Sepharose as described (21.Bertsch U. Haefs M. Moller M. Deschermeier C. Fanick W. Kitzerow A. Ozaki S. Meyer H.E. Mayr G.W. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 228: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). For a time course of proteolysis, affinity-purified IP3K147-C at a concentration of 0.48 mg/ml was digested in a 50-μl volume at 30 °C in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, with 0.01 mg/ml trypsin (sequencing grade) for up to 20 min. Trypsin was added from a 0.5 mg/ml stock solution in 1 mm HCl, and 10-μl samples were withdrawn from the reaction and stopped by mixing with 3.3 μl 4 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer (0.2 mTris-Cl, pH 6.8, 15% glycerol, 8.6% SDS, 0.8 mmercaptoethanol, 0.4 mg/ml bromphenol blue) and immediate heating to 95 °C for 8 min. For experiments regarding the effects of substrates on proteolysis, either 1 mm ATP or 250 μmInsP3 or both were added to the same reaction buffer. The dependence of proteolysis on the InsP3 concentration was determined in parallel reactions (10 μl) containing 50 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.24 mg/ml IP3K, 0.01 mg/ml trypsin, and InsP3 varying from 0.5 to 100 μm. After 20 min the reaction was stopped as above. For the determination of NH2-terminal peptide sequences of proteolysis intermediates, samples separated by SDS-PAGE were blotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (34.Kyhse-Andersen J. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1984; 10: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (2159) Google Scholar), and immobilized protein bands were sequenced on an Applied Biosystems 470 A Sequenator. The mutagenesis of the catalytic domain of chicken IP3K was done essentially as described in Ref. 35.Picard V. Ersdal-Badju E. Lu A. Bock S.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2587-2591Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar. Either plasmid pEGIK (21.Bertsch U. Haefs M. Moller M. Deschermeier C. Fanick W. Kitzerow A. Ozaki S. Meyer H.E.

Gene (Amst.). 1999; 228: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) or plasmid pGEM-IP3K Xba/Sph, based on the vector pGEM3Z (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and containing a 460-base pair insert of chicken IP3K representing amino acids 147–299, was used as template. For the pGEM-IP3K Xba/Sph template, primers NP24 (5′-GACGTTGTAAAACGACGGCCAGTG-3′) and RP24 (5′-AACAGCTATGACCATGATTACGCC-3′) were used as flanking primers, whereas for the pEGIK template primers UB24 (5′-GAAGAGCTCACTGAAGCCCGTGAGAAACC-3′) and UB40 (5′-CTGAGTGATCTCTCTAGAGAAGAAAGTTAGTTA-3′) were used as flanking primers. All oligonucleotides were from MWG Biotech (Ebersberg, Germany). The resulting polymerase chain reaction products were ligated into appropriately digested plasmid vectors. E. coli XL1 Blue cells transformed with the ligation products were selected for positive transformants by plasmid minipreparation and restriction digests. Insert sequences were verified by dideoxynucleotide sequencing. Appropriate restriction fragments of mutated polymerase chain reaction products were ligated into plasmid pEGIK. For the expression of mutant proteins BL21(DE3) bacteria were transformed with these vectors. IP3K activity and the K m values for InsP3 were determined as described previously (21.Bertsch U. Haefs M. Moller M. Deschermeier C. Fanick W. Kitzerow A. Ozaki S. Meyer H.E. Mayr G.W. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 228: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). TheK m values for ATP were derived from initial rates with a saturating initial InsP3 concentration of 25 μm and varying initial concentrations of ATP (0.025–2 mm). Statistic testing was with t test for unpaired samples. SDS-PAGE was done according to Ref. 36.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar. Semidry Western blotting was performed essentially as described (34.Kyhse-Andersen J. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1984; 10: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (2159) Google Scholar). For the simultaneous detection of immunoreactivity of all monoclonal antibodies against fragments of IP3K, a whole SDS-polyacrylamide gel was loaded with protein in a pocket covering the entire width of the gel. After blotting, the membranes were fixed in a multiwell chamber (Phase, Lübeck, Germany) allowing the simultaneous application of up to 20 primary antibody solutions for immunodecoration onto separate, sealed strips of the membrane, with each strip covering the entire separation length of the gel in the running direction. After incubation with primary antibodies on separate membrane strips, the membrane was treated as a whole with secondary antibody, washing, and staining solutions. We subjected the recombinantly expressed catalytic domain of chicken IP3K147-C to a limited protease treatment in the absence or presence of ATP and InsP3 and analyzed the resulting proteolytic fragments on SDS-PAGE. In the absence of substrates, cleavage with trypsin resulted in the immediate formation of at least five distinct bands with slightly reduced apparent molecular masses (36–32 kDa) down to a more protease-resistant fragment of 31 kDa (Fig.1 A). The most prominent stable cleavage intermediate of lower molecular mass was a 16-kDa fragment that was formed shortly after the 31-kDa fragment. The same cleavage pattern was found if ATP was present in the reaction mix at a concentration of 1 mm (not shown). In contrast, the presence of 250 μm InsP3 led to the formation of a quite stable, prominent 21-kDa digestion intermediate, whereas the formation of the 16-kDa fragment was suppressed (Fig. 1 B). Besides, a stabilization of a 31-kDa fragment occurred also. The same pattern of proteolytic fragments was observed when both substrates ATP (1 mm) and InsP3 (250 μm) were present (not shown). Amino-terminal peptide sequences of isolated proteolytic fragments were determined (Fig.2). For the 31-kDa band two superimposed sequences with initial yields of 70 and 49 pmol, respectively, were found, which could be easily assigned to two fragments starting at Tyr-178 and Ala-191, respectively. The 21-kDa band yielded a single peptide sequence (initial yield 159 pmol) corresponding to a fragment starting at Glu-271. Two superimposed sequences were also found for the 16-kDa band, which could be attributed to two fragments starting at Tyr-306 and Glu-311 with initial yields of 78 and 63 pmol, respectively. The observed M r values imply that all fragments are not or only minimally truncated at the COOH terminus of the catalytic domain. Therefore, a segment protected from cleavage by trypsin in the InsP3-bound state (i.e. the NH2-terminal part of the 21-kDa fragment which is not present in the 16-kDa band) comprises 35 amino acids ranging from Glu-271 to Arg-305 (Fig. 3). Using varying InsP3 concentrations during tryptic digestion, an EC50 value of 36 μm was derived for the inhibition of tryptic cleavage after residues Arg-305 and Arg-310 as detected by the percentage of 21-kDa fragment formed. An even lower EC50 value (2.6 μm) was found for the inhibition of cleavage after residue Arg-270 related to the percentage of 31-kDa band formation (Fig. 4).Figure 2NH2-terminal peptide sequences for proteolytic fragments of IP3K.

Western blot experiments with a set of NH2-terminally or COOH-terminally truncated IP3K fragments, generated either by tryptic digestion of IP3K147-C or by nested deletion of the coding sequence for a GST-IP3K fusion protein (see “Experimental Procedures”), revealed for all monoclonal antibodies only epitopes within the 35-amino acid segment protected by InsP3 against tryptic cleavage. All antibodies recognized the NH2-terminally truncated 21-kDa fragment starting at Glu-271 (Fig.5 B) and none the 16 kDa fragment starting at Tyr-306 (Fig. 5 A). On the other hand, the COOH-terminally truncated fragment from Thr-164 to Glu-285 was recognized extremely weakly only by antibodies Kin4, -6, -9, and -17 (Fig. 5 E). The fragment from Thr-164 to Leu-289, four amino acids longer, was recognized strongly by six antibodies (Kin4, -6, -9, -13, -15, and -17; Fig. 5 D), whereas all antibodies reacted with the fragment from Thr-164 to Ala-317(Fig. 5 C). The weak lower M r bands appearing in Fig. 5 Ein the lanes of the antibodies Kin8, -11, -12, and -13 appear to be caused by cross-reactivity toward unrelated E. coliproteins, which are more prominent on this particular blot, since the staining sensitivity was enhanced in order to detect the weak specific reactivity toward the IP3K fusion protein. From this pattern of immunoreactivity we can conclude that the motif “VDPL” (position 286–289) is part of the epitopes recognized by six of the monoclonal antibodies and that their complete epitopes (epitope A) lie between Glu-271 and Leu-289. The epitope recognized by all other antibodies (epitope B) is contained within the segment from Ala-290 to Arg-305. A schematic representation is shown in Fig. 3. In enzyme assays performed with IP3K147-C underV max conditions for both substrates in the presence and absence of antibodies, all antibodies inhibited IP3K activity by at least 30% and up to 70% when they were presen"
https://openalex.org/W2029070230,"Mammalian cells regulate iron levels tightly through the activity of iron-regulatory proteins (IRPs) that bind to RNA motifs called iron-responsive elements (IREs). When cells become iron-depleted, IRPs bind to IREs present in the mRNAs of ferritin and the transferrin receptor, resulting in diminished translation of the ferritin mRNA and increased translation of the transferrin receptor mRNA. Likewise, intestinal epithelial cells regulate iron absorption by a process that also depends on the intracellular levels of iron. Although intestinal epithelial cells have an active IRE/IRP system, it has not been proven that this system is involved in the regulation of iron absorption in these cells. In this study, we characterized the effect of overexpression of the ferritin IRE on iron absorption by Caco-2 cells, a model of intestinal epithelial cells. Cells overexpressing ferritin IRE had increased levels of ferritin, whereas the levels of the transferrin receptor were decreased. Iron absorption in IRE-transfected cells was deregulated: iron uptake from the apical medium was increased, but the capacity to retain this newly incorporated iron diminished. Cells overexpressing IRE were not able to control iron absorption as a function of intracellular iron, because both iron-deficient cells as well as iron-loaded cells absorbed similarly high levels of iron. The labile iron pool of IRE-transfected cell was extremely low. Likewise, the reduction of the labile iron pool in control cells resulted in cells having increased iron absorption. These results indicate that cells overexpressing IRE do not regulate iron absorption, an effect associated with decreased levels of the regulatory iron pool."

Exactly how the latter operate has yet to be elucidated. Both the DNA binding and transactivation functions of TCFs are regulated by mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) (12.Kortenjann M.

For example, Elk-1 possesses nine consensus sites for extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), most of which are phosphorylatedin vivo when cells are stimulated with mitogens (9.Marais R.

Some of the same sites are also recognized by stress-activated protein kinases/c-Jun-N-terminal kinases (SAPKs/JNKs) and isoforms of p38 mapk (16.Cavigelli M. Dolfi F. Claret F.-X. Karin M.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). They appear to be essential for activation by ERKs and SAPK/JNKs but not p38 mapk. MAPKs also form cytoplasmic complexes either directly or through scaffold proteins with their activating kinases (24.Schaeffer H.J. Catling A.D. Eblen S.T. Collier L.S. Krauss A. Weber M.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1668-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 25.Elion E.A. Science. 1998; 281: 1625-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 26.Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 481-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Activation of ERKs by MAP/ERK kinases (MEKs) induces ERK dimerization, which is a prerequisite for translocation of ERKs into the cell nucleus (27.Khokhlatchev A.V. Canagarajah B. Wilsbacher J. Robinson M. Atkinson M. Goldsmith E. Cobb M.H. Cell. 1998; 93: 605-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). This, in turn, is essential for ERK2-induced neurite outgrowth and cell transformation (28.Robinson M.J. Stippec S.A. Goldsmith E. White M.A. Cobb M.H. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1141-1150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus the active nuclear form of ERKs is a dimer. Studies of complexes between TCFs, SRF, and the c-fos SRE suggest that TCF interactions are dynamic (7.Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3317-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Consistent with this idea, it has been proposed that TCFs can be activated selectively (29.Strahl T. Gille H. Shaw P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11563-11568Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and that selective activation leads to changes in SRE occupation by TCFs. 2E. D. Gallagher and P. E. Shaw, manuscript submitted. This implies that TCFs are not necessarily bound to DNA when targeted by MAPKs. Unbound inactive TCFs may exist as dimers, which would serve as appropriate substrates for active ERK dimers. This idea is further supported by reports that related ets proteins can form homo- and heterodimers mediated by their ets domains (30.Carrere S. Verger A. Flourens A. Stehelin D. Duterquecoquillaud M. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3261-3268Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Interactions between Elk-1 carboxyl-terminal domains have also been reported (8.Gille H. Kortenjann M. Strahl T. Shaw P.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1094-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Here we have assessed the ability of Elk-1 to form oligomers and demonstrate that a fraction of Elk-1 can exist in cells as homotypic dimers. These results have implications for our understanding of the mode of action of TCFs. The construction of pQE-Elk-1 and pCMV5-Elk-1(his) has been described elsewhere (15.Gille H. Kortenjann M.

The construction of pCMV5-Sap1a(his) has been described elsewhere (29.Strahl T. Gille H. Shaw P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11563-11568Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). All recombinant plasmid constructs were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. Further details are available upon request. Human embryonal kidney (HEK 293) and COS cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were transfected with 4–6 μg of the various Elk-1 constructs by the standard DNA-calcium phosphate coprecipitation procedure. Eighteen h after transfection, cells were washed and serum-starved (0.2%) for 24 h. Cells were then harvested after prior stimulation where appropriate with EGF (75 nm) for 20 min in 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.8, containing 50 μm NaF, 40 μm Na4P2O7, 5 μm MgCl2, 10 μmNa3VO4, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 40 μg/ml leupeptin, 3 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm benzamidine, 1 μm aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin. After incubation on ice for 20 min, cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation, and the clear lysate was removed. HEK 293 cells were transfected with expression constructs for His-tagged Elk-1 and HA-Elk-1 deletions. Cell lysates were prepared as described above, except that 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, was used instead of 20 mm Tris/HCl and incubated with various concentrations of disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS; Pierce) for 90 min on ice. Samples were then analyzed by Western blotting with the anti-HA antibody (3F10) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or an anti-Elk-1 polyclonal antibody. Bacterially expressed Elk-1 was purified as described (15.Gille H. Kortenjann M. Thomae O. Moomaw C. Slaughter C. Cobb M.H. Shaw P.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 951-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar), except that the elution buffer consisted of 75 mm borate, pH 8.0, containing 25 mm EDTA and 10% glycerol. The purified protein was then concentrated to 0.5–1 mg/ml (Flowgen concentrators) and applied (0.2 ml) at 0.3 ml/min to a Superose-12 HR 10/30 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) pre-equilibrated with 75 mm borate buffer, pH 8.0, and 10% glycerol. Fractions were collected and analyzed by Western blotting with an anti-Elk-1 antibody. COS cells were transfected with expression constructs for His-tagged Elk-1 or Elk-1 deletions, and cell lysates were prepared as described above. Lysates were concentrated to 3–4 mg/ml (Flowgen concentrators) and subjected to gel chromatography as described. The His-tagged proteins were concentrated by incubation of the eluates (0.5 ml) with nickel-agarose beads (Qiagen) and detected by Western blotting with the anti-His antibody (Qiagen). Calibration of the column was carried out with the following protein standards: YADH (Sigma), bovine serum albumin, ovalbumin, and chymotrypsinogen A (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Apparent molecular masses for Elk-1 complexes were estimated by comparing elution peaks from each run with the corresponding calibration curve. Cell lysates were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with nickel-agarose beads (Qiagen) pre-equilibrated with lysis buffer containing 10 mm imidazole. The beads were then washed three times with lysis buffer containing 20 mm imidazole, and complexes were eluted by boiling for 5 min in SDS sample buffer before SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were transferred onto Hybond P nitrocellulose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and probed with the anti-His (Qiagen), anti-HA (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), anti-Elk-1, or anti-phospho-Elk-1 (New England Biolabs) antibodies and visualized by standard ECL procedures (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) on a luminescence imaging system (Fuji). Reprobing of membranes was carried out in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. We previously developed a bacterial system to generate purified Elk-1 protein (15.Gille H. Kortenjann M. Thomae O. Moomaw C. Slaughter C. Cobb M.H. Shaw P.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 951-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). Although yields were not high (250–500 μg/liter of culture), purity and homogeneity were good, with only two major contaminants from the single step purification. Sequencing revealed one of them to be a previously identified bacterial protein with high affinity for nickel-agarose (32.Wulfing C. Lombardero J. Pluckthun A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2895-2901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bacterial Elk-1 elutes from a Superose-12 column as a single peak with an apparent molecular mass of 162 ± 11 kDa (Fig.1). As the calculated molecular mass of Elk-1 is 45 kDa and given our previous demonstrations of the functional integrity of bacterial Elk-1 (8.Gille H. Kortenjann M. Strahl T. Shaw P.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1094-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 15.Gille H. Kortenjann M. Thomae O. Moomaw C. Slaughter C. Cobb M.H. Shaw P.E.

A. 1996; 93: 11563-11568Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), this observation suggests that Elk-1 is unlikely to exist in solution as a monomer. Although the protein preparations were relatively clean, we considered that the behavior of Elk-1 might be due to its interaction with one or more bacterial proteins or some other consequence of expressing Elk-1 in bacteria. To rule out these possibilities, we expressed the same protein in COS cells and applied it to the same gel filtration column. Again Elk-1 eluted with an apparent molecular mass in excess of 160 kDa, indicative of an oligomeric structure (Fig.2 A).Figure 2Detection of Elk-1 oligomers in eukaryotic cell lysates. COS cells were transfected with expression constructs for his-tagged Elk-1 (A) or the Elk-1 deletion mutant ΔB (B). Cell lysates were applied to a Superose-12 HR 10/30 gel filtration column, and 0.5 ml fractions were collected. Elk-1(his) was concentrated by incubation with nickel-agarose beads and analyzed by Western blotting using the anti-His antibody (Qiagen). Quantification was performed on the digital image. AU refers to arbitrary units. The apparent molecular mass for full-length Elk-1(his) expressed in COS cells was 185 ± 23 kDa (n = 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Elk-1 is known to form complexes with other eukaryotic proteins, specifically with SRF and MAPKs. The domains of Elk-1 responsible for these specific interactions, including the B-box and D-box, respectively (see Fig. 4 A), have been mapped (6.Ling Y. Lakey J.H. Roberts C.E. Sharrocks A.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2431-2440Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 22.Yang S.H. Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Sharrocks A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 710-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 23.Jacobs D. Glossip D. Xing H. Muslin A.J. Kornfeld K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). To rule out the possibility that the high apparent molecular mass of Elk-1 expressed in COS cells was due to interactions with either SRF or MAPKs, Elk-1 proteins lacking each of these short domains (see Fig.4 A) were overexpressed, and their oligomeric status was assessed. Although the peaks shifted marginally, both deleted proteins eluted in the same apparent molecular mass range (Fig. 2 Band data not shown). Based on an apparent molecular mass of 62 kDa for Elk-1 expressed in eukaryotic cells, the most likely explanation for these results is that Elk-1 forms dimers in solution. However, as the behavior of a protein under gel filtration is dependent on its Stokes radius and not its molecular mass, we cannot rule out the formation of Elk-1 tetramers. We reasoned that if Elk-1 dimers exist, they could be covalently linked by a chemical cross-linking reagent such as DSS, which would capture and stabilize them. We therefore overexpressed His-tagged Elk-1 in HEK 293 cells, which were serum-starved or starved and stimulated with EGF. Cell lysates were prepared, treated with varying concentrations of DSS, and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting with anti-HA antibodies. Incubation of lysates from either starved or EGF-stimulated cells with DSS led to the appearance of a high molecular mass Elk-1 species (Fig. 3, upper panel). The apparent molecular mass of this species is ∼130 kDa, which implies that Elk-1 is present in a dimeric complex in HEK 293 cells. In some experiments a second complex in excess of 200 kDa was also detected (Fig. 3, upper panel, upper arrow). This may be due to Elk-1-forming tetramers or Elk-1 in complex with other proteins. It has previously been shown that Elk-1 is able to form a quaternary complex with SRF on the c-fos SRE and that the complex is stabilized, in part, by interactions between Elk-1 carboxyl-terminal domains (8.Gille H. Kortenjann M. Strahl T. Shaw P.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1094-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In addition, other ets family proteins have been shown to interact through their ets domains (30.Carrere S. Verger A. Flourens A. Stehelin D. Duterquecoquillaud M. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3261-3268Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We therefore looked for complexes containing Elk-1 proteins that lack various domains (see Fig. 4 A). Elk-1 from which the ets domain had been deleted (HA-Elk-1Δets) yielded a similar low mobility species upon DSS cross-linking (Fig. 3, middle panel). Similarly, the removal of a carboxyl-terminal portion of Elk-1 (HA-Elk-1ΔApa) allowed a single complex to form. We also tested the two deletion mutants Elk-1ΔB and Elk-1ΔD in this assay. Again both gave rise to a comparable high molecular mass complex (not shown). EGF stimulation had no effect on the formation of these complexes, suggesting that phosphorylation has no effect on the oligomeric status of Elk-1. The simplest explanation for these observations is that Elk-1 forms dimers involving two types of homotypic interaction, one betweenets domains and the other mediated by a carboxyl-terminal motif. Consequently, deletion of either the ets domain or carboxyl terminus from Elk-1 still allows dimers to form through the remaining domain. To probe the involvement of Elk-1 domains in directing the formation of Elk-1 dimers further, we co-expressed versions of Elk-1 in HEK 293 cells (Fig.4 A) in pairs, one with a carboxyl-terminal histidine tag (Elk-1(his)) and the other with an amino-terminal hemagglutinin epitope (HA-Elk-1). Elk-1(his) was then isolated from cell lysates on nickel-agarose beads and detected with an antibody against the tag (anti-His). Its association with HA-Elk-1 was assessed by reprobing with an antibody against the epitope tag (anti-HA). As shown in Fig.4 B, a fraction of HA-Elk-1 co-purifies with Elk-1(his) in both serum-starved and EGF-stimulated cells, again suggesting that interactions occur irrespective of the phosphorylation state of Elk-1, which is indicated by the anti-phospho-Elk antibody. Co-expression of similarly tagged versions of Elk-1 from which theets domain had been deleted (Elk-1Δets(his) and HA-Elk-1Δets) also led to HA-Elk-1Δetsco-purifying with its His-tagged counterpart on nickel-agarose beads (Fig. 4 C). This confirms that Elk-1 interactions can occur independently of the ets domain, consistent with our previous results (8.Gille H. Kortenjann M. Strahl T. Shaw P.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1094-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The association between Elk-1 carboxyl-terminal domains was shown previously to require a short, 19-amino acid motif containing hydrophobic residues. As shown in Fig. 4 D, a His-tagged version of Elk-1 lacking this motif (Elk-1Δ19(his)) was able to direct the co-purification of HA-Elk-1ΔApa. In this experiment both proteins can be identified by an antibody specific for Elk-1 (anti-982). This confirms our conclusions from the cross-linking experiments that besides the carboxyl terminus, a second domain in Elk-1 is able to direct Elk-1 dimer formation. Given that other ets proteins have been shown to undergo dimer formation via their ets domains (30.Carrere S. Verger A. Flourens A. Stehelin D. Duterquecoquillaud M. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3261-3268Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) we considered this to be feasible for Elk-1, which would explain the ability of Elk-1Δ19(his) and HA-Elk-1ΔApa to interact. Thus we predicted that a version of Elk-1 without a carboxyl-terminal domain would be unable to interact with Elk-1 lacking an ets domain. When we tested the ability of Elk-1Δets(his) to interact with HA-Elk-1ΔApa under identical conditions, we were unable to detect co-purification of these two forms of Elk-1 (Fig. 4 E). Elk-1 is one of three known TCFs that share structural and functional homology. All three are co-expressed in several cell lines, including mature B lymphocytes (3.Wasylyk B. Hagman J. Gutierrezhartmann A. Trends Biochem. 1998; 23: 213-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar).2 The formation of TCF heteromers would offer the potential for further levels of transcriptional control. We were therefore interested to see if Elk-1 could interact with other TCFs. To this end we overexpressed Sap1a(his) and HA-Elk-1 together and looked for co-purification on nickel-agarose beads. As shown in Fig.5, Elk-1 could not be detected in complex with Sap1a, suggesting that heteromers between Elk-1 and Sap1a do not form. Furthermore, this result also confirms that nonspecific interactions are not the cause of Elk-1 dimer formation. The role of TCFs in regulating gene expression in response to extracellular stimuli is established, but their function at the mechanistic level is only superficially understood. Both DNA binding and transcriptional activation by TCFs is regulated principally by ERKs, which, once phosphorylated by MAP/ERK kinases (MEK), translocate to the nucleus as active dimers. Given that interactions between promoters and TCFs are dynamic and, in the absence of any data suggesting that TCFs and ERKs can form stable, DNA-bound complexes, we hypothesized that TCFs may also have the capacity to form dimers. This contention is supported here by three lines of evidence. Elk-1 derived from either bacterial or eukaryotic cells elutes as a single peak from gel-filtration columns, with a molecular mass above 160 kDa. Although this result may be due to the formation of complexes between Elk-1 and other proteins, this is unlikely given the different sources of Elk-1 and the fact that it was overexpressed in both systems. We also assessed forms of Elk-1 from which the short domains targeted by SRF and MAPKs had been deleted (ElkΔB and ElkΔD, respectively) (6.Ling Y. Lakey J.H. Roberts C.E. Sharrocks A.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2431-2440Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 22.Yang S.H. Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Sharrocks A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 710-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). These two deletion mutants behave in the same way as full-length Elk-1, eluting from the column at the same point as Elk-1 or, in the case of ElkΔB, slightly later, presumably due to its reduced size. These results provide a more specific means of ruling out that the biophysical characteristics of Elk-1 are due to its interactions with other eukaryotic proteins. As the molecular mass of Elk-1 lies somewhere between a calculated value of 45 kDa and an apparent value in denaturing polyacrylamide gels of 62 kDa, the simplest interpretation of these observations is that Elk-1 forms dimers in solution. However, the possibility that Elk-1 forms a tetramer cannot be ruled out. Protein cross-linking experiments yielded a high molecular mass Elk-1 species from both starved and EGF-stimulated cell lysates. The apparent molecular mass of 130 kDa in denaturing SDS gels is consistent with Elk-1 dimerization. That only a fraction of Elk-1 is captured in complexes in these experiments is expected due to the relative inefficiency of the cross-linking agent in whole cell lysates. However, the degree of cross-linking varied among experiments, and in some instances a second, larger complex was observed, which may have formed by Elk-1 complexing with other cellular proteins or as a result of tetramer formation by Elk-1. At present we cannot distinguish between these two possibilities. However, deletion of domains known to confer interaction with SRF and MAPKs did not influence the major cross-linked species (not shown). We therefore infer that this complex consists exclusively of Elk-1. Moreover, deletion of either the amino- or carboxyl-terminal region of Elk-1 had no effect on the formation of this complex. Thus both amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains of Elk-1 appear to direct homotypic interactions in the absence of the remainder of the molecule. Other ets proteins have been shown to form dimers. Erg proteins, of which there are three isoforms, form homo- and heterodimers with each other and with Fli-1, Ets-2, Er81, and Pu-1 (30.Carrere S. Verger A. Flourens A. Stehelin D. Duterquecoquillaud M. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3261-3268Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Two domains of Erg are implicated: the ets domain, which directs both homo- and heterodimerization, and the “pointed” domain, which is implicated only in homodimer formation. Although this would appear to be similar to the case of Elk-1 addressed here, the pointed domain is absent from TCFs. Elk-1 interactions could also be detected in eukaryotic cell lysates by co-immunoprecipitation experiments (results not shown) and by an analogous approach involving affinity purification of histidine-tagged molecules. This kind of experiment is widely established as a means of determining whether proteins associate within cells. Essentially it allowed us to confirm and refine the indications of the cross-linking experiments; the amino-terminal ets domain of Elk-1 interacts with forms of Elk-1 containing the ets domain, and equally, the carboxyl-terminal domain interacts with Elk-1 proteins harboring an intact carboxyl-terminal domain. The deletion of 19 amino acids (375–394) from Elk-1 was sufficient to abolish the carboxyl-terminal interaction (HA-Elk-1Δets and Elk-1Δ19(his); data not shown), in line with previous results obtained in vitro with glutathione S-transferase-Elk fusion proteins (8.Gille H. Kortenjann M. Strahl T. Shaw P.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1094-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Heterotypic interactions between amino and carboxyl-terminal domains of Elk-1 could not be detected. Thus, Elk-1 contains two distinct interaction interfaces that function independently. We also assessed the ability of Elk-1 to form heteromers with its closest relative Sap1a. Despite levels of Sap1a(his) expression exceeding those of Elk-1Δets(his), we were unable to detect any interaction between Elk-1 and Sap1a. In the first instance, this result demonstrates that the interactions we observe in these assays do not result arbitrarily from the overexpression of the proteins in question. Secondly, given the high degree of similarity between these two proteins, it appears that small differences may dictate dimer formation by TCFs, in contrast with at least one otherets protein, Erg, which appears to be somewhat more promiscuous (30.Carrere S. Verger A. Flourens A. Stehelin D. Duterquecoquillaud M. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3261-3268Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation state of Elk-1 had little if any effect on its behavior under gel filtration (results not shown), as Elk-1 eluted as a single peak at the same position whether the protein was purified from serum-starved or serum-stimulated cells. However, it is possible that the column was unable to resolve unphosphorylated and phosphorylated oligomers clearly. Differences between tetramers and dimers may also not have been apparent, although we are confident that monomers would have been resolved. In addition, there was no difference apparent in Elk-1 cross-linking experiments performed with lysates from starved and EGF-stimulated cells. More explicitly, co-purification of Elk-1 species was observed regardless of whether the experiments were performed with lysates of serum-starved or EGF-stimulated cells. Although not implying that the conformation of Elk-1 remains unchanged subsequent to Elk-1 phosphorylation by MAPKs, these results do indicate that under our experimental conditions the intermolecular interactions governing dimerization in solution are maintained. What then is the role of dimerization in Elk-1 function? We have found recently that the occupation of a SRE in the egr-1 promoter by TCFs alters when B cells are stimulated by B cell receptor engagement.2 This implies either that upon activation TCFs transfer from one binding site to another within the genome or that when inactive, they can exist in the nucleus unbound to DNA. Presumably, the higher the level of TCF expression in cells, the more unbound TCF will be present. In this state they would be targeted by MAPKs, which are active in the nucleus as dimers. Elk-1 dimers would thus provide an appropriate substrate for activated MAPKs. It is known that TCFs are high affinity substrates of MAPKs, particularly ERKs, in the absence of DNA and that as a consequence of phosphorylation, the DNA binding affinity of TCFs is increased (9.Marais R. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1993; 73: 381-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar, 10.Janknecht R. Ernst W.H. Pingoud V. Nordheim A.

Kortenjann M. Thomae O. Moomaw C. Slaughter C. Cobb M.H. Shaw P.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 951-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). One means of achieving the latter would be if phosphorylation-dependent conformational changes in Elk-1 unmasked the DNA binding interface such that, in the presence of appropriate sites, DNA binding would then ensue. Thus DNA may effectively cause dissociation of theets domains. This model is outlined in Fig.6. Notably, our experiments were performed in the absence of DNA. Although the solution structures of several ets domains unequivocally show that this motif binds to DNA as a monomer (33.Liang H. Mao X. Olejniczak E.T. Nettesheim D.G., Yu, L. Meadows R.P. Thompson C.B. Fesik S.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 871-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 34.Mo Y. Vaessen B. Johnston K. Marmorstein R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 201-212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), no data on the structure of theets domain in the absence of DNA is presently available. In the case of c-Jun regulation by SAPK/JNKs, a different mechanism appears to prevail. The viral oncogene v-Jun lacks the δ domain of c-Jun, which serves as a docking site in c-Jun for SAPK/JNKs (35.Dérijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.-H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2955) Google Scholar). This deletion results in a gain of function, consistent with the idea that inactive SAPK/JNKs serve as inhibitors of c-Jun function (36.Dai T.N. Rubie E. Franklin C.C. Kraft A. Gillespie D.A.F. Avruch J. Kyriakis J.M. Woodgett J.R. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 849-855PubMed Google Scholar, 37.May G.H.W. Funk M. Black E.J. Clark W. Hussain S. Woodgett J.R. Gillespie D.A.F. Curr. Biol. 1997; 8: 117-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In this context it was shown recently that SAPK/JNKs can interact with c-Jun via the δ domain and a second interface in the DNA binding domain to form a stable, DNA-bound complex (21.May G.H. Allen K.E. Clark W. Funk M. Gillespie D.A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33429-33435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Although TCFs also have a MAPK-docking motif similar to the c-Jun δ domain, its deletion from Elk-1 was shown to result in a transcription factor that is activated only weakly (22.Yang S.H. Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Sharrocks A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 710-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), and no evidence of a stable DNA-bound complex comprising TCFs and MAPKs has been forthcoming (8.Gille H. Kortenjann M. Strahl T. Shaw P.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1094-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). On the basis of our model, at least two predictions can be made. First, if the DNA binding interface of unphosphorylated Elk-1 is masked by intermolecular interactions, stabilization of the inactive Elk-1 dimer would make it refractory to DNA binding even after phosphorylation by MAPKs. Second, dimers formed by Elk-1 mutants lacking the carboxyl-terminal interface may dissociate in the presence ofets DNA binding sites. Experiments to test these predictions are currently under way.

To evaluate the possibility that transcription factors may activate SV40 replication by acting on the chromatin structure of the origin, we used an in vivoreplication system in which we targeted GAL4 fusion proteins to the minimally required origin. We found that the proline-rich transcriptional activation domain of nuclear factor I (NF-I), which has been previously shown to interact with histone H3, specifically activates replication.

They stimulate replication by modulating the efficiency of replication, but not the basic mechanism of replication. Different mechanisms for the stimulation of replication by transcription factors have been proposed. For instance, on the adenovirus origin of replication, cellular transcription factors such as NF-I,1 a member of the CAAT box-binding transcription factor CTF/NF-I family of DNA-binding proteins, activate replication by recruiting the viral DNA polymerase to the origin (1.Nagata K. Guggenheimer R.A. Enomoto T. Lichy J. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6438-6442Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 2.Mul A.M. van der Vliet P.C.

A. 1994; 91: 11537-11541Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In other cases, replication depends on complex arrays of transcription factor binding sites, such as in polyoma and SV40. SV40 DNA replication initiates at a well-defined origin (SV40 ori) that is flanked by two auxiliary sequences. The binding motifs for the Sp1 transcription factor contained in the auxiliary sequences are required for efficient SV40 replication (4.Guo Z. Gutierrez C. Heine U. Sogo J.M. DePamphilis M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3593-3602Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). SV40 is a relatively simple and widely used model to study the activation of cellular DNA replication because its initiation requires only one viral protein, the large T-antigen; all the other proteins needed for initiation and elongation are provided by the host cell (5.Kelly T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17889-17892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, SV40 circular DNA is covered with nucleosomes, analogous to cellular chromatin (6.Cremisi C. Pignatti F. Croissant O. Yaniv M. J. Virol. 1976; 17: 204-211Crossref Google Scholar). The mechanisms allowing SV40 replication activation by transcription factors remain poorly understood. In vitro studies have suggested that transcription factors might recruit replication factors such as Replication Factor A to the origin (7.Li R. Botchan M.R. Cell. 1993; 73: 1207-1221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 8.He Z. Brinton B.T. Greenblatt J. Hassell J.A. Ingles C.J. Cell. 1993; 73: 1223-1232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Alternatively, it has been suggested that transcription factors prevent the chromatin structure from interfering with the binding of initiation factors to the replication origin, analogous to their probable role on promoters. For instance, polyomavirus and SV40 auxiliary sequences are only required in in vitro replication assays in the presence of repressive chromatin structures (9.Majumder S. Miranda M. DePamphilis M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1131-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In infected cells, the SV40 ori is free of nucleosomes in a fraction of the minichromosomes, which is thought to represent the actively replicating fraction. It was suggested that Sp1, which is necessary for efficient initiation of SV40 replication, is involved in these changes in chromatin structure (10.Gruss C. Sogo J.M. Bioessays. 1992; 14: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Interestingly, both Sp1 and NF-I have been reported to bind histone H3, suggesting an involvement of these transcription factors in chromatin remodeling (11.Alevizopoulos A. Dusserre Y. Tsai-Plugfelder M. von der Weid T. Wahli W. Mermod N. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3051-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). NF-I has been implicated in the regulation of several steroid-sensitive promoters subjected to chromatin remodeling, and was shown to mediate reconfiguration of reconstituted chromatin in vitro (11.Alevizopoulos A. Dusserre Y. Tsai-Plugfelder M. von der Weid T. Wahli W. Mermod N. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3051-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 12.Archer T. Cordingley M. Wolford R. Hager G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 688-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 13.Schild C. Claret F.X. Wahli W. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 423-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In addition, NF-I binding sites adjacent to the SV40 ori core have been shown to prevent chromatin-mediated repression of DNA replication in vitro (14.Cheng L. Kelly T.J. Cell. 1989; 59: 541-551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Thus, NF-I and other transcription factors might function by perturbing the local distribution of nucleosomes, thereby increasing the accessibility of the origin to the replication machinery. In this study we investigated whether transcription factors, namely NF-I, can activate SV40 replication through their interaction with chromatin components. We show that the activation domains of several transcription factors previously shown to interact with H3 also mediate SV40 replication activation. Both H3 interaction and replication were found to be similarly reduced by a single amino acid substitution in NF-I, thus strongly correlating the interaction with histone H3 with the activation of replication. This study supports the role of chromatin remodeling activities of transcription factors in the activation of SV40 replication. The replication standard plasmid pUCSV 40ori was constructed by inserting theSalI-HindIII fragment of pSVori Mariacarmen (J. Sogo) into pUC19, cleaved with HindIII andAflIII, after filling in the SalI andAflIII site with the Klenow enzyme. For p5GAL4ori, the replication reporter plasmid, the NcoI HindIII fragment from pSVori Mariacarmen, was inserted into pCTF1 (15.Mermod N. O'Neill E.A. Kelly T.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1989; 58: 741-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar), cleaved with NcoI and HindIII. This intermediate vector was cut with BamHI and XbaI, and five GAL4 binding sites were inserted as a BglII-XhaI fragment from pG5BCAT (16.Lillie J.W. Green M.R. Nature. 1989; 338: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). The sequences encoding the GAL4 fusion proteins of NF-I (11.Alevizopoulos A. Dusserre Y. Tsai-Plugfelder M. von der Weid T. Wahli W. Mermod N. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3051-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) (GAL(399–499), GAL(438–499), and GAL(486–499)) were introduced as HindIII-EcoRV fragments from the respective pSGGAL fusion expression vectors into pRSV BXB (17.Bruder J.T. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 545-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), cut with XbaI and HindIII, with the XbaI site filled in with the Klenow enzyme. The coding sequences for GAL(399–438), GAL(399–472), GAL(399–486), and GAL(438–472) were transferred from their pSG424 backbone asHindIII-XbaI fragments into pRSV BXB cleaved with the same enzymes. The vectors with RSV promoter-driven expression of the GAL4-NF-I fusions carrying a point mutation (GAL(399–499)YD491, GAL(399–499)YD497, and GAL(399–499)YF497) were generated by cloning the latter as HindIII and blunt-ended AflIII fragments into pRSV BXB cleaved with HindIII and Klenow-repaired BamHI. For pRSV GAL(479–499)wt and the point mutation thereof, GAL(479–499)YD497, the relevant fragments were removed from their parental pSG GAL4 fusion vector as HindIII and Klenow-repaired BamHI fragments and cloned into theHindIII and Klenow-repaired AflIII-cut vector pRSV BXB. Coding sequences for the fusions GALSp1(132–243), GALOct2(99–161), and GALAp2(31–76) were removed from their pSG424 backbone (11.Alevizopoulos A. Dusserre Y. Tsai-Plugfelder M. von der Weid T.

This GAL fusion sequence was cloned into theHindIII-XbaI vector fragment of pRSV BXB as aHindIII-XbaI fragment. The construction of pMLV-VP-H3(10–136) has been described previously (11.Alevizopoulos A. Dusserre Y. Tsai-Plugfelder M. von der Weid T. Wahli W. Mermod N. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3051-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). For replication assays, COS7 cells were electroporated with a DNA mixture containing 1 μg of pUCori replication standard plasmid, 10 μg of p5GAL4ori replication reporter, and 10 μg of RSV expression vector. Sonicated salmon sperm DNA (Sigma) was added to a total of 50 μg of transfected DNA. The medium was supplemented with 50 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine. Cells were harvested 36 h after transfection, and plasmid DNA was extracted using the QIAQUICK plasmid extraction kit according to the supplier's instructions (QIAGEN). DNA was eluted from the columns with 50 μl of H2O. Extracted plasmids were linearized byBamHI and separated on a 0.6% agarose gel. Plasmid bands were excised and subjected to scintillation counting in Hionic Fluor R (Packard) to quantify the incorporated radiolabeled thymidine. The value obtained for the reporter plasmid was normalized to that obtained for the standard plasmid. For CAT assays, COS7 cells were co-transfected with three plasmids: (a) an expression vector for the indicated GAL4 fusions, (b) an expression vector for VP16-transcriptional activation domain alone (VP) or an expression vector fused to amino acids 10–136 of histone H3 (VP-H3), and (c) the G5BCAT reporter construct. Cell extracts were prepared with lysis buffer (Promega), and the assays were performed as described previously (11.Alevizopoulos A. Dusserre Y. Tsai-Plugfelder M. von der Weid T. Wahli W. Mermod N. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3051-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). All figures display the mean of at least three experiments. For bandshift analysis of GAL fusion proteins, transiently transfected COS7 cells were harvested 36 h after transfection, washed once in 1× phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in 100 μl of extraction buffer (20 mmTris, pH 7.5, 20% glycerol, 500 mm KCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) by repeated freeze-thaw cycles, as described previously (19.Martinez E. Dusserre Y. Wahli W. Mermod N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2937-2945Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Whole cell lysates were normalized for total protein concentration. 4 μg of total protein extract were incubated in 20 μl of extraction buffer for 10 min at room temperature with a 32P end-labeled double-stranded DNA probe containing the 17-base pair GAL4 binding site (5′-GATCCGGGTCGGAGTACTGTCCTCCGACTGC-3′). Protein-DNA complexes were separated from free probe on native 4% polyacrylamide gels as described in Ref. 20.Carey M. Kakidani H. Leatherwood J. Mostashari F. Ptashne M. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 423-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar and revealed by phosphorimaging (Molecular Dynamics). To evaluate the role of transcription factors in the activation of SV40 replication, COS7 cells were transfected with a replication reporter plasmid containing five GAL4 binding sites adjacent to the SV40 ori core, p5GALori, along with chimeric cDNA expression vectors for GAL fusion proteins. These encode the DNA binding and dimerization domain of the yeast GAL4, either alone (amino acids 1–147; GAL DBD) or fused to the coding sequences of the transcriptional activation domains of CTF/NF-I (amino acids 399–499, GAL Pro) or Sp1 (amino acids 132–243, GAL Sp1) (Fig.1 A). A plasmid with the full origin of replication, including both auxiliary sequences, was used as an internal reference plasmid for transfection and replication (Fig.1 A, pUCori). SV40 DNA replication was assayed by the addition of [3H]thymidine to the growth medium and by the extraction of radiolabeled replicated DNA. To ascertain that the recovered radiolabeled plasmids were true replication products, they were digested with DpnI, which only cleaves methylated DNA that has not been replicated. As an additional control, a digestion with MboI was performed (Fig. 1 B) becauseMboI is dam methylation sensitive and cuts only non-methylated DNA. The recovered plasmids are cleaved byMboI, but not by DpnI, and are therefore replication products. The presence of the five GAL4 binding sites had no influence per se on the basal replication activity of the modified replication origins. No difference in replication activity was detected between the two replication reporter plasmids p5GALori and pCori, a plasmid in which the aux-2 sequence is deleted (data not shown). The proline-rich transcriptional activation domain of CTF/NF-I fused to GAL (Fig.1 B, GAL Pro) efficiently activated replication of p5GALori. The expression of the DNA binding domain of GAL4 (GAL DBD) had a weak but significant activation effect on SV40 replication in the presence of GAL4 binding sites, consistent with previously published results (21.Cheng L. Workman J.L. Kingston R.E. Kelly T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 589-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 22.Bennett-Cook E.R. Hassell J.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 959-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In the absence of binding sites, GAL DBD and other GAL4 fusions had no effect on replication (data not shown). It has been proposed that Sp1 and NF-I bind histone H3 and reorganize chromatin. Oct2, but not VP16, was also found to interact with histone H3 in two-hybrid assays (11.Alevizopoulos A. Dusserre Y. Tsai-Plugfelder M. von der Weid T. Wahli W. Mermod N. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3051-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Thus, the activation domains of the latter transcription factors were tested for their capacity to activate replication using the same experimental approach as that used for NF-I. The activation by GAL NF-I was fixed as the reference level of replication and is used in all comparisons below. Whereas GAL Oct2 and GAL Sp1 stimulated replication, they did so to a lesser extent than GAL NF-I. Activation by these transcription factors was not due to the mere presence of a transcriptional activation domain because expression of a GAL fusion containing the VP16 activation domain or a portion thereof did not result in detectable replication (Fig.2 A; data not shown). Activation of replication by GAL Sp1 was expected because the aux-2 sequence contains Sp1 binding sites (23.Kelman Z. O'Donnell M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 185-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and replacement of the aux-2 sequence with artificial Sp1 binding sites has been reported to activate SV40 replication in CV1 cells (24.Lednicky J. Folk W.R. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6379-6390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of replication by GAL Oct2 is also consistent with the previous finding that Oct binding sites, which are found in the enhancer sequence of the SV40 promoter, can substitute for aux-2 when adjacent to the A/T-rich element of the ori core (4.Guo Z. Gutierrez C. Heine U. Sogo J.M. DePamphilis M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3593-3602Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 25.Lee-Chen G.J. Woodworth-Gutai M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3086-3093Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). NF-I and Oct2 may therefore substitute for Sp1 in replication activation by using the same basic mechanism. However, the activation domain of VP16 did not activate replication in our assay in COS7 cells, indicating that the presence of a potent transcriptional activation domain is not sufficient for replication activation. This suggests that it is not transcriptional activityper se that activates SV40 replication and that another activity is required. Thus, there is a direct correlation between the potential of the activation domains to activate SV40 replication and the ability of the activation domains to interact with histone H3. To test for the interaction of these fusion proteins in COS7 cells, two-hybrid transcription experiments were performed in parallel to the replication assays. COS7 cells were transfected with the CAT reporter construct, expression vectors for the indicated GAL fusion proteins, and expression vectors for the VP16 activation domain, either alone (VP) or fused to mouse histone H3.3 (VP-H3; Fig. 2 B). An interaction between a GAL fusion protein and H3 in VP-H3 recruits the full-length VP16 transcriptional activation domain to the promoter, thus leading to higher levels of transcription. When assayed for transcriptional activity with VP16 alone, all GAL4 fusions activated transcription, and the most potent of all was GAL VP16, as seen previously (11.Alevizopoulos A. Dusserre Y. Tsai-Plugfelder M. von der Weid T. Wahli W. Mermod N. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3051-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In the two-hybrid assay, the proline-rich activation domain of NF-I interacts efficiently with histone H3 in COS7, as do the activation domains of Sp1 and Oct2. However, no interaction between the acidic transcriptional activation domain of VP16 and the VP16-H3 fusion could be detected. Control experiments were performed to rule out the possibility that different activation levels may actually be due to different expression levels of the activator proteins (Fig. 2 C). Gel mobility shift assays demonstrated that all the fusion proteins were expressed at comparable levels and that the presence of H3-VP16 had no effect on the expression levels of the GAL4 fusion proteins. We find a close correlation between the H3 interaction and replication activation. The three transcription factors that interacted with histone H3 also significantly activated SV40 replication, whereas both VP16 and GAL DBD did not significantly activate replication and did not interact with histone H3 in the two-hybrid assay. Together, these data suggest that the presence of a strong transcriptional activation domain, as seen in GAL VP16, is not sufficient for replication activation and that the other domains induce SV40 replication by interacting with H3. Six deletion mutants of the proline-rich domain of NF-I were used to determine more precisely which of its subdomains activate the SV40 origin of replication. The C-terminal deletion mutants GAL(399–472) and GAL(399–438) activated replication but did so less efficiently than the full-length activation domain. This indicates that part of the replication activity maps to the C terminus of the NF-I activation domain. Further deletion of the N-terminal portions of the NF-I transcriptional activation domain, as seen in GAL(438–472), resulted in the loss of all activation potential. Thus, a second part of the replication activation potential of the proline-rich domain resides in the N-terminal portion. Indeed, N-terminal deletion mutants GAL(438–499), GAL(472–499), and GAL(486–499) mediated reduced replication as compared with the full-length domain (Fig.3 A). The loss of activation potential of GAL(438–499) and GAL(399–472) compared with GAL(399–438) and GAL(486–499) is most likely due to the presence of a central inhibitory subdomain (amino acids 438–472). These results indicate that both the C- and N-terminal portions of the NF-I transcriptional activation domain are required for full activation of the replication origin. In contrast, the central portion of the proline-rich domain has no detectable effect on replication activity. The same deletion mutants were used to map the region of GAL(399–499) that interacts with histone H3 in the two-hybrid assay. The assays for H3 interaction and replication activation were performed in the same transfections to allow a direct comparison of the results. The C-terminal deletion mutants GAL(399–472) and GAL(399–438) show strongly reduced transcriptional activation, 30- and 20-fold lower than that of GAL(399–499) (Fig. 3 B). However, their interaction with H3 decreased but remained detectable, in keeping with their transcriptional activity. Conversely, the N-terminal deletion mutant GAL(438–499) showed both reduced transcriptional activity and H3 binding activity. As seen before, the expression of GAL4 fusions was not affected by the coexpression of the histone fusion constructs (Fig.3 C). These data indicate that two NF-I domains interact with H3 and mediate replication activation. One domain maps to the 13 C-terminal amino acids and is similar to the histone H3-interacting domain first identified in mouse fibroblastic cells (11.Alevizopoulos A. Dusserre Y. Tsai-Plugfelder M. von der Weid T. Wahli W. Mermod N. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3051-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Moreover, GAL(472–499) and GAL(486–499) only modestly activate transcription on their own, but they show high levels of activity when assayed for interaction with the VP-H3 fusion protein and replication activation. In addition, we identified another portion of the proline-rich domain that also shows interaction with histone H3. This second histone H3-interacting domain activated SV40 replication to approximately the same extent as the C terminus, yet it did not significantly activate transcription on its own. Deletion of both the C- and N-terminal domains in mutant GAL(438–472) was required to inhibit both interaction with histone H3 and replication activation. Overall, the data indicate a dual role for C- and N-terminal extremities of the NF-I transcriptional activation domain in histone H3 interaction and replication activation and imply that interaction with the histone, rather than mere transcriptional activation, confers SV40 ori activation by NF-I. The C-terminal portion of the transcriptional activation domain is clearly one determinant of H3 interaction and replication activation. To further evaluate the role of this domain, we tested three GAL NF-I fusions bearing single point mutations at the C terminus. GAL(399–499, Y491D) (tyrosine 491 changed to aspartate) and GAL(399–499, Y497F) (tyrosine 497 changed to phenylalanine) efficiently activated both replication and transcription, and interaction with VP16-H3 did not significantly differ from wild type GAL(399–499) (Fig. 4). In contrast, the protein bearing a mutation of tyrosine to aspartate at position 497, GAL(399–499, Y497D), abolished the activation of p5GALori replication. Transcriptional activation and histone interaction were also similarly reduced with this mutation (Fig. 4 B). Further deletion of the N-terminal H3 interaction domain in the Y497D mutant abolished H3 interaction and replication activation, as expected (data not shown). Overall, these results provide evidence that the proline-rich domain of NF-I activates SV40 replication and further implicate the interaction with histone H3 in SV40 replication activation. Previous studies have indicated that NF-I can remodel chromatin in vitro, whereas Sp1 has been suggested to maintain the SV40 origin nucleosome-free (14.Cheng L. Kelly T.J. Cell. 1989; 59: 541-551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 26.Sogo J.M. Stahl H. Koller T. Knippers R. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 189-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). These findings, together with the association of chromatin remodeling and transcriptional activation at many promoters (27.Beato M. Eisfeld K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3559-3563Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 28.Wolffe A.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 240-244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 29.Kadonaga J.D. Cell. 1998; 92: 307-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar), may thus point to chromatin remodeling as a common mechanism for the activation of both transcription and replication. In both cases, chromatin structure alteration by the action, direct or indirect, of transcription factors would be an early step in activation. It is interesting to note that the H3-binding domain of NF-I is capable of restructuring the chromatin of target promoters and concomitantly prevents heterochromatic silencing in yeast. 2C. Boscheron, K. Müller, K. Carmine-Simmen, N. Mermod, and E. Gilson, manuscript in preparation. Therefore, the binding of histone H3 by NF-I may be the key step by which this transcription factor overcomes chromatin repression on both promoters and replication origins."
https://openalex.org/W2063588399,"CD38 ligation has been shown to induce activation of intracellular signaling cascade in T lymphocytes through a Lck-dependent pathway. However, it is not clear how Lck initiates the CD38-mediated signaling process. In the present study, we showed that CD38 and Lck were physically associated through the cytoplasmic tail and the Src homology 2 domain, respectively. This was evidenced by coimmunoprecipitation of Lck with CD38 and Lck with isolated CD38 cytoplasmic domain from T cell lysate, cell lysate of COS-7 cells cotransfected with cDNAs of Lck and CD38, or a mixture of in vitro translated CD38 and Lck. Because the CD38 cytoplasmic domain does not contain any tyrosine residue, the interaction should be independent of phosphotyrosine. The interaction was further confirmed by in vitro interaction between a purified Lck Src homology 2 domain and a nonphosphosynthetic peptide corresponding to the membrane proximal region of the CD38 cytoplasmic domain. In addition, CD38 ligation resulted in an elevated tyrosine kinase activity of the CD38-associated Lck and ultimate activation of interleukin-2 gene transcription. Furthermore, expression of a kinase-deficient Lck mutant suppressed interleukin-2 gene activation in a dose-dependent manner. These results strongly suggested that CD38 ligation indeed tranduced signals for T cell activation using its associated Lck."
https://openalex.org/W2084655397,"Murine and human macrophages rapidly decreased the level of cholesteryl ester hydroperoxides in low density lipoprotein (LDL) when cultured in media non-permissive for LDL oxidation. This process was proportional to cell number but could not be attributed to the net lipoprotein uptake. Macrophage-mediated loss of lipid hydroperoxides in LDL appears to be metal ion-independent. Degradation of cholesteryl linoleate hydroperoxides was accompanied by accumulation of the corresponding hydroxide as the major product and cholesteryl keto-octadecadienoate as a minor product, although taken together these products could not completely account for the hydroperoxide consumption. Cell-conditioned medium possessed a similar capacity to remove lipid hydroperoxides as seen with cellular monolayers, suggesting that the activity is not an integral component of the cell but is secreted from it. The activity of cell-conditioned medium to lower the level of LDL lipid hydroperoxides is associated with its high molecular weight fraction and is modulated by the availability of free thiol groups. Cell-mediated loss of LDL cholesteryl ester hydroperoxides is facilitated by the presence of α-tocopherol in the lipoprotein. Together with our earlier reports on the ability of macrophages to remove peroxides rapidly from oxidized amino acids, peptides, and proteins as well as to clear selectively cholesterol 7-β-hydroperoxide, results presented in this paper provide evidence of a potential protective activity of the cell against further LDL oxidation by removing reactive peroxide groups in the lipoprotein.

Med. 1989; 320: 915-924Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is likely that the cells present in the arterial wall and developing lesions participate in the oxidative process (1.Berliner J.A. Heinecke J.W. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1996; 20: 707-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar, 3.Steinbrecher U.P. Zhang H. Lougheed M. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1990; 9: 155-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which these cells promote lipoprotein oxidation are of great interest and have been investigated in numerous studies (4.Garner B. Jessup W. Redox Report. 1996; 2: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), as they could be potential targets for therapeutic or preventative intervention in the disease process. In addition to pro-oxidant action of cells toward LDL, it has been demonstrated that under certain conditions the cells could have potential antioxidant activity toward the lipoprotein. For example, in some situations macrophages could inhibit metal-catalyzed lipid peroxidation (5.van Reyk D.M. Jessup W. Dean R.T. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 1119-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 6.Kritharides L. Jessup W. Dean R.T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 323: 127-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) by sequestering metals from the culture medium. Endothelial cells have also been shown to prevent formation of lipid hydroperoxides in LDL (7.Smalley D.M. Hogg N. Kalyanaraman B. Pritchard Jr., K.A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 3469-3474Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar); this activity switched to a pro-oxidant action of the cells upon increasing the initial concentrations of hydroperoxides in LDL or metal ions in media. A potential protective role has been demonstrated for human hepatic cells, which selectively take up and detoxify cholesteryl ester hydroperoxides from high density lipoprotein particles (8.Sattler W. Stocker R. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 771-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We have previously reported the capacity of murine macrophages to remove peroxides rapidly from oxidized amino acids, peptides, and proteins (9.Fu S. Gebicki S. Jessup W. Gebicki J.M. Dean R.T. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 821-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In the case of the oxidized proteins at least, this process was likely to be extracellular, as it was not accompanied by significant net uptake of the protein molecules. In the present study, we demonstrated the ability of cells to extracellularly detoxify cholesteryl ester hydroperoxides in LDL in a culture medium that did not support cell-mediated LDL oxidation, and we studied possible mechanisms of this process. We also tested different cell types for their ability to reduce levels of lipid hydroperoxides in lipoprotein and regulation of this process. RPMI 1640, Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS, phenol red-free), phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Fraction V), d-α-tocopherol, bathocuproine disulfonic acid (BCS), trypsin, and diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DETAPAC) were purchased from Sigma. Fetal calf serum (FCS) was obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. White cell concentrate (<24 h ex vivo) and human serum (HS) were kindly provided by the New South Wales Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service, Sydney, Australia. Both FCS and HS were heat-inactivated at 56 °C for 30 min. Dulbecco's minimum essential medium (DMEM) was from Trace BioSciences. EDTA, sodium borohydride (NaBH4), and potassium bromide (KBr) were from BDH, chloramphenicol was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and NaCN was from Merck. 2,2′-Azo-bis(2-amidinopropane)hydrochloride (AAPH) was from Polysciences, desferal (desferrioxamine mesylate, DF) was purchased from Ciba-Geigy (Pendle Hill, New South Wales, Australia). Nanopure water was used for preparation of all aqueous buffers. PBS was subsequently treated with washed Chelex 100 resin (Bio-Rad) to remove contaminating amounts of transition metals (10.van Reyk D.M. Brown A.J. Jessup W. Dean R.T. Free Radical Res. 1995; 23: 533-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). PD-10 columns prepacked with Sephadex G-25 (Medium) were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. HPLC-grade hexane, methanol, and isopropyl alcohol were from Mallinckrodt or EM Science, and ethanol (analytical grade) was from BDH. All other chemicals used were of the highest purity available. Resident macrophages (MPM) were isolated from 6-week-old Quackenbush Swiss strain mice, after CO2asphyxiation, by peritoneal lavage with ice-cold DMEM, containing 0.38% (w/v) sodium citrate, penicillin G (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). The isolated cells were immediately plated in 12-well (22-mm diameter) cell culture plates (Falcon) at 4 × 106 cells per well or at the indicated density for cell number dependence experiments. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h and then washed three times with PBS to remove non-adherent cells. The cells were further incubated in DMEM containing 10% FCS for 18 h. J774 A.1 mouse monocyte-macrophage cells (J774, obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, batch F-10089) were grown in DMEM containing 10% (v/v) FCS in 160-cm2 cell culture flasks (Becton Dickinson). Cells were subcultured at 1:5 dilution every 6–7 days. The day before an experiment the cells were plated in 6-well (35-mm diameter) cell culture plates (Falcon) at 2.5 × 106 cells per well. Human monocytes were isolated from white cell concentrates using centrifugal elutriation as described previously (11.Garner B. Dean R.T. Jessup W. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 421-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Purified monocytes (>90% pure as judged by nonspecific esterase staining) were adhered in 22-mm cell culture wells (Falcon) at 4 × 106 cells per well and cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% (v/v) HS for 7 days to allow them to differentiate to macrophages. The cells were cultured in a humidified incubator at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in air. All tissue culture media were supplemented with 20 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cell viability was assessed by the trypan blue exclusion test. Prior to experiments cells were washed twice with warm PBS. 1-ml portions of DMEM were added to cells and incubated for 2.5 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in air. The medium pooled from several cell culture wells was spun (1,000 × g, 5 min, 5 °C) to remove any detached cells, and the supernatant was used as the cell-conditioned medium. In some experiments 2 ml of cell-conditioned medium was spun in a Centricon-10 concentration unit (Amicon) at 4,900 × gand 4 °C for 45 min, and then the high and low molecular weight fractions (retentate and filtrate, respectively) were reconstituted to the original volume with DMEM. Separation of high and low molecular weight components using filtration through a PD-10 column is described in detail in the legend to Fig. 3. LDL (density range 1.02–1.05) was prepared from plasma from fasted normolipidemic healthy volunteers as described in detail (12.Baoutina A. Dean R.T. Jessup W. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 114-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by density gradient ultracentrifugation (Beckman L8-M ultracentrifuge) using a vertical (VTi50) rotor for 2.5 h at 242,000 × g (mean) and 10 °C. A second centrifugation at a density of 1.063 g/ml with Ti70 rotor (242,000 × g (mean), 22 h, 10 °C) removed traces of contaminating albumin. The LDL was subsequently dialyzed for 18 h at 4 °C against 4 × 1 liter of deoxygenated PBS containing chloramphenicol (0.1 g/liter) and EDTA (1.0 g/liter), filter-sterilized (0.45-μm), and stored in the dark at 4 °C until use (within 7 days). Immediately prior to oxidation or incubation with cells, LDL was passed through two consecutive PD-10 columns equilibrated with Chelex 100-treated PBS to remove EDTA. LDL was further sterilized (0.45-μm filter) for cellular experiments. An aliquot of LDL (in the range of 2–4 mg of LDL protein/ml) was incubated with 1 mm AAPH at 37 °C for approximately 1 h. Under these conditions of low radical flux, oxidation of LDL resulted in formation of small amounts of lipid hydroperoxides with a less than 10% loss of α-tocopherol (α-TOH) and no changes in protein and lipid composition (13.Neuzil J. Thomas S.R. Stocker R. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1997; 22: 57-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 14.Hazell L.J. Stocker R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 541-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). AAPH was removed by two sequential PD-10 column filtrations. The mildly oxidized LDL used in experiments in this study contained 28.5 ± 12.5 nmol CEOOH per mg of LDL protein (mean ± S.D., n = 25) with TOH content being 8.2 ± 3.9 nmol/mg (mean ± S.D.,n = 25). Oxidized α-TOH-depleted LDL was prepared as described in detail (13.Neuzil J. Thomas S.R. Stocker R. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1997; 22: 57-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). LDL (∼2–4 mg/ml) was oxidized with 50 mm AAPH at 37 °C for 20–30 min. AAPH was removed by two sequential gel filtrations using the PD-10 columns. The resulting LDL contained undetectable levels of α-TOH and cholesteryl ester hydroperoxides at levels comparable to that reached in mildly oxidized TOH-containing LDL (prepared as above). Oxidized α-TOH-depleted LDL was without other significant detectable changes in lipid composition (13.Neuzil J. Thomas S.R. Stocker R. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1997; 22: 57-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). TOH-depleted LDL prepared as above was replenished with α-TOH as described (13.Neuzil J. Thomas S.R. Stocker R. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1997; 22: 57-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). In detail, an aliquot of TOH-depleted LDL was incubated with lipoprotein-deficient serum (LPDS) (2:1, v/v) supplemented with α-TOH (dissolved in Me2SO (15.Esterbauer H. Dieber-Rotheneder M. Striegl G. Waeg G. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1991; 53: 314-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar), final concentration of Me2SO <1%) at 37 °C for 4 h. LPDS was prepared from plasma from fasted normolipidemic healthy volunteers (16.Knight B.L. Soutar A.K. Biochem. J. 1982; 202: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and contained no detectable levels of α-TOH. The final concentration of α-TOH in the incubation mixture was seven times that of the corresponding native unoxidized LDL. Control mildly oxidized and control TOH-depleted LDL were incubated with LPDS in the presence of Me2SO (<1%, v/v). After incubation the density of the mixture was adjusted with KBr to 1.21, and LDL was then reisolated using a quick LDL isolation method (17.Sattler W. Mohr D. Stocker R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 469-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) with a 3.5-h centrifugation. The LDL was passed through two consecutive PD-10 columns, filter-sterilized, and used immediately. 1-ml portions of DMEM (or 1.5-ml for J774 cultures) containing 100 μg of LDL protein were incubated in cell culture wells at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in air with or without cells. In experiments using cell-conditioned medium, 1 ml of this was mixed with 100 μg of LDL and incubated in cell-free wells under the above conditions. At the times indicated, the LDL-containing media were removed from the cell culture wells and spun in an Eppendorf centrifuge at 16,000 × g for 2 min at 4 °C to remove any detached cells. 0.5 ml of the supernatant (or cell-free medium) was extracted with 1 ml of cold methanol and 5 ml of hexane and then centrifuged (1,000 × g, 5 min, 10 °C). 4 ml of the hexane phase were withdrawn, evaporated under vacuum, and redissolved in 200 μl of isopropyl alcohol. Samples were sealed in glass vials and stored at −80 °C until HPLC analysis (within 7 days). Recovery of α-TOH and lipid in the extracts was ≥99%; α-TOH, cholesteryl esters (CE) and their hydroperoxides (CEOOH) were stable under this condition for at least 6 weeks (data not shown). In experiments where cellular lipid analysis was carried out, the cells were washed three times with warm PBS, and the cell lipids were extracted twice with 1 ml of hexane/isopropyl alcohol (3:2, v/v) (12.Baoutina A. Dean R.T. Jessup W. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 114-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were then lysed by incubation in 0.5 ml of cold 0.2m NaOH for 15 min at 4 °C, and the lysates were stored at −20 °C for protein assay (within 7 days). Lipid extracts from cells or LDL-containing media were analyzed using reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) with a Supelco ODS column (25 × 0.46 cm, 5 μm particle size with a 2-cm Pelliguard guard column) as described (18.Witting P.K. Mohr D. Stocker R. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 299: 362-375Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar) using a mobile phase of ethanol/methanol/isopropyl alcohol (19.5:6:1, v/v/v) containing 5 mm lithium perchlorate. Analysis was performed using electrochemical or fluorescent detection (for α-TOH, with ≈0.1 pmol and pmol detection limit, respectively), UV210 (for free cholesterol (FC) and cholesteryl esters (CE) detection), or UV234 (for oxidized products of CE) detection. Cholesteryl ester hydroperoxides (CEOOH) were analyzed by post-column chemiluminescence (CL) detection (detection limit ≈1–5 pmol). In some experiments, HPLC analysis was performed as in Kritharides, et al. (19.Kritharides L. Jessup W. Gifford J. Dean R.T. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 213: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) with separation of CEOOH and cholesterol ester hydroxides (CEOH) peaks. In brief, the lipids were separated on an ODS column using acetonitrile/isopropyl alcohol/water (44:54:2, v/v/v) as a mobile phase with UV210detection for unoxidized FC and CE, UV234 detection for CEOOH and CEOH, and UV279 for cholesteryl keto-octadecadienoate (CE=O). Analysis of tocopherylquinone was performed by HPLC with electrochemical detection as described (20.Kohar I. Baca M. Suarna C. Stocker R. Southwell-Keely P. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1995; 19: 197-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar); the response factor was 34,187 area units per pmol of tocopherylquinone. 2P. Witting, personal communication. Quantitation of FC, individual CEs, and α-TOH was performed using calibration curves for each of the commercially available compounds. CEOOH were quantified using a cholesteryl linoleate hydroperoxide standard prepared as described previously (17.Sattler W. Mohr D. Stocker R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 469-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 21.Yamamoto Y. Brodsky M.H. Baker J.C. Ames B.N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 160: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). The concentration of CEOH was calculated using a cholesteryl linoleate hydroxide standard prepared by reduction of corresponding hydroperoxide standard with NaBH4. [3H]Cholesteryl linoleate hydroperoxide ([3H]Ch18:2-OOH) was prepared from [1a,2a-3H]cholesteryl linoleate ([3H]Ch18:2; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, specific activity 45 Ci/mmol) by the method previously described (8.Sattler W. Stocker R. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 771-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) with small modifications. Briefly, 200 μCi of [3H]Ch18:2 dissolved in 200 μl of toluene was oxidized at 60 °C for 5 h using 403 mm 2,2′-azo-bis(2,4-dimethylvaleronitrile) (Polyscience, Warrington, PA). Following oxidation, non-oxidized tracer was separated from [3H]Ch18:2-OOH using an Al2O3 solid phase extraction column as described (8.Sattler W. Stocker R. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 771-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The isolated [3H]Ch18:2-OOH was further purified by RP-HPLC using isopropyl alcohol/acetonitrile/water (44:54:2, v/v/v) mobile phase (19.Kritharides L. Jessup W. Gifford J. Dean R.T. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 213: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) with UV234 and on-line radiometric detection (Radiomatic Flo-One Beta detector, Packard Instrument Co.) using Ultima-FLQ M scintillation mixture at 1.5 ml/min. The activity eluting between 12.6 and 15 min (i.e. retention time of Ch18:2-OOH standard) was collected, dried under argon, and redissolved in isopropyl alcohol. The purified [3H]Ch18:2-OOH (specific radioactivity 1.5 Ci/mmol) was quantified using RP-HPLC with post-column CL detection as described (18.Witting P.K. Mohr D. Stocker R. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 299: 362-375Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar) with Ch18:2-OOH as a standard. To prepare unilamellar liposomes aliquots of stock solutions ofdl-α-phosphatidylcholine dimyristoyl (DMPC), FC, α-TOH, Ch18:2-OOH, and [3H]Ch18:2-OOH were mixed, the organic solvent was evaporated under vacuum, and the lipids were resuspended in PBS. 1 ml of the lipid emulsion contained 0.2 mg of DMPC, 120 nmol of FC, 20 nmol of α-TOH, 30 nmol of Ch18:2-OOH, and 1.5 μCi of [3H]Ch18:2-OOH; the concentrations of α-TOH and Ch18:2-OOH in the liposome preparation were chosen to achieve levels similar to those in the experiments with LDL. The mixture was mixed vigorously, and the emulsion was sonicated in three 1-min cycles on ice (Branson Sonifier 450). The resultant unilamellar liposomes were sterilized (0.45-μm filter) and used within 1 h. In the experiments with cell-conditioned medium an aliquot of liposomes was mixed with the cell-conditioned medium from MPM (1:10 dilution) and incubated for 2.5 h at 37 °C. The lipids were then extracted as above and analyzed using RP-HPLC with UV234 and radiometric detection and isopropyl alcohol/acetonitrile/water mobile phase (see above). The 3H-labeled tracers were identified by comparing their retention times with those of known, unlabeled standards and of purified [3H]Ch18:2-OOH. To assess the total radioactivity in each sample, 50-μl aliquots of methanol and hexane layers of the lipid extracts were mixed with Ultima Gold HFP scintillation mixture and quantified on Liquid Scintillation Analyzer Tri-carb 2100TR (Packard Instrument Co.). More than 99.2% of the total radioactivity in each analyzed sample was detected in the hexane layer of the lipid extract, and further analysis of the methanol layer was not performed. To measure the concentrations of α-TOH, FC, and Ch18:2=O in a sample, an aliquot of each lipid extract was also subjected to a separate RP-HPLC run using identical chromatographic conditions with fluorescent (for TOH), UV210 (for FC), and UV279 (for Ch18:2=O) detection. MPM (7 × 106 cells per 35-mm well in 6-well plate) were washed three times with PBS (37 °C) and subsequently incubated at 37 °C in 1.5 ml of HBSS containing 125 μm BCS and 100 μmascorbate for 3 h. This had no effect on cell viability (22.Garner B. vanReyk D. Dean R.T. Jessup W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6927-6935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Parallel control incubations were performed in the absence of cells. The culture supernatants were removed and centrifuged to remove any cells, and their absorbance was measured at 482 nm. In some experiments the cells were incubated for 3 h in 1.5 ml of HBSS, lacking either ascorbate or BCS, or both of them. After the supernatants were removed and spun, these reagents were added to make the medium complete,i.e. containing 100 μm ascorbate and 125 μm BCS. The concentration of copper was calculated using an extinction coefficient ε = 12.15 mm−1 cm−1 for the BCS·Cu(I) complex (22.Garner B. vanReyk D. Dean R.T. Jessup W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6927-6935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Three separate wells were used for each condition in three independent experiments. The protein content of LDL samples and cell lysates was measured using the bicinchoninic acid method (Sigma) with BSA as a standard. BSA standards were prepared in water or in 0.2m NaOH for the LDL preparations or cell extracts, respectively. The samples were incubated for 60 min at 60 °C, and the absorbance at 562 nm was measured. Incubation of MPM with LDL (100 μg/ml) containing modest levels of CEOOH (28.5 ± 12.5 nmol/mg LDL protein, mean ± S.D. from 25 independent LDL preparations) in DMEM, the medium non-permissive for LDL oxidation, resulted in a time-dependent loss of CEOOH in LDL (Fig.1 A). In the same medium the level of CEOOH remained stable in LDL incubated in cell-free wells (Fig. 1 A). The levels of free cholesterol and cholesteryl esters in the medium remained unchanged during incubation of cells with LDL under these conditions (not shown). This indicates that the observed loss of CEOOH in LDL was not likely to be due to the whole LDL particle uptake by cells or to continuing lipid peroxidation. When LDL was incubated with cells plated at different densities, the decrease in CEOOH concentration occurred at different rates, with higher rate corresponding to the higher cell number condition (not shown). This resulted in the different amounts of CEOOH remaining in LDL at the end of incubation (Fig. 1 B). Parallel to reduction of CEOOH level, incubation of MPM with LDL in DMEM resulted in a decrease in the concentration of TOH in LDL (Fig. 1 C), whereas no significant loss of TOH was observed in cell-free conditions (Fig.1 C). Loss of TOH in LDL also occurred in cell number- (Fig.1 D) and time-dependent manner. No detectable amounts of tocopherylquinone were formed in LDL by the end of incubation with cells (not shown). Stoichiometry between changes in CEOOH and TOH levels was not consistent between experiments and varied from 1:1 to 6.7:1 in 16 independent experiments with the mean 3.5 ± 1.6. Loss of CEOOH in LDL during incubation with cells (Fig. 1 and2 A) was accompanied by formation of the corresponding hydroxides (CEOH), but this was not stoichiometric (Fig. 2 C). The amount of CEOH formed by the end of incubation of LDL with cells was on average 42.5 ± 18.5% of loss of CEOOH (mean ± S.D. from 16 independent experiments), with the lowest and highest values being, respectively, 7.5 and 72%. Analysis of cholesteryl keto-octadecadienoate (CE=O), another product of hydroperoxide metabolism, in media samples demonstrated formation of this product in the presence of cells but not in cell-free controls (Fig. 2 D). However, the amount of CE=O accumulated in LDL during its incubation with cells was severalfold less than amount of CEOOH lost in LDL (Fig. 2, A and D). Statistical analysis of data from six experiments in which this lipid was analyzed demonstrated that average accumulation of CE=O was 9.8 ± 6.1% of loss of CEOOH in LDL. In a separate experiment we studied stability of the CEOH in LDL in the presence of cells to examine the possibility that CEOH undergo further cell-mediated metabolism. Mildly oxidized LDL prepared as described under “Materials and Methods” was treated with NaBH4 to reduce chemically all hydroperoxides to the corresponding hydroxides. After removal of non-reacted NaBH4 by gel filtration of LDL through two sequential PD-10 columns, the LDL was mixed with DMEM (100 μg/ml) and incubated with 4 × 106 MPM for 2.5 h. No changes in the concentration of LDL CEOH, as well as all other lipids assessed, were observed at the end of the incubation (not shown, results are reproducible in two separate experiments each run in triplicate), suggesting that CEOH in LDL was stable in the presence of cells. These results indicate that cell-mediated loss of CEOOH in LDL seen in DMEM could not be completely explained by its stoichiometric reduction to CEOH or CE=O.Figure 2Loss of CEOOH (A) and TOH (B) was not accompanied by stoichiometric formation of corresponding hydroxide (C) or cholesteryl keto-octadecadienoate (D). LDL was incubated in DMEM in the presence of 4 × 106 MPM (open bars) or in cell-free wells (hatched bars). The levels of FC and CE in LDL remained unchanged (not shown). Values are expressed as nmol/mg LDL protein and are means ± S.D. for triplicate wells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To study whether the observed loss of TOH in LDL in the presence of cells could be explained by a transfer of TOH from LDL to cells, we analyzed both cellular lipid extracts and LDL lipid extracts before and after incubation of LDL with cells. The basal level of TOH in MPM plated at 4 × 106 was 3.26 ± 0.26 pmol/well (mean ± S.D. for triplicate cultures). After 2 h incubation with LDL cellular TOH levels increased to 4.86 ± 0.63 pmol/well, and the concentration of TOH in LDL decreased from 8.1 ± 0.7 nmol/well to 4.1 ± 0.1 nmol/well (mean ± S.D.). The fact that TOH loss in LDL exceeds by 250-fold the increase in cellular TOH content during their incubation, together with our earlier data on the stability of TOH content in macrophages incubated in the absence of LDL (12.Baoutina A. Dean R.T. Jessup W. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 114-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicates that loss of TOH in LDL under our experimental conditions could not be accounted for by its selective transfer to cells. Incubation of MPM with LDL in the different metal ion-free medium, HBSS, also resulted in reduction in CEOOH level (not shown). The rate of CEOOH disappearance in LDL in HBSS was 1.9 ± 0.2 times lower than in DMEM (mean ± range of two separate experiments). Similarly to DMEM, levels of FC or CE in LDL incubated with cells in HBSS remained unchanged (not shown). We demonstrated that the different capacity of cells to reduce levels of CEOOH in the two different media could not be explained by the presence of phenol red in DMEM ("
https://openalex.org/W1614211966,"One of the most useful technologies in a cell biologist's toolbox is flow cytometry, usually performed by a machine called a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS). Flow cytometry assesses cellular properties (shape, stainability, and so forth) that can be used to distinguish among cells in mixed populations, which can then be sorted into different collection bins."
