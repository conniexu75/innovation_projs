https://openalex.org/W2034616267,"Quantum tunneling, the passage of a microscopic system from one state to another by way of a classically forbidden path, is theoretically possible in the macroscopic world. One can now make direct observations of such macroscopic quantum tunneling in very small magnetic structures. This is possible because of significant advances both in the ability to obtain magnetic systems of almost any desirable size, shape, and composition and in the development of superconducting instrumentation for the detection of extremely weak magnetic signals. As an example, measurements on magnetic horse spleen ferritin proteins with the predictions of quantum tunneling theory are discussed and shown."

Laser-probe (40)Ar/(39)Ar step-heating of the two most disparate samples yielded plateau dates of 9.94 +/- 0.05 and 5.59 +/- 0.10 Ma, corresponding, within 2 sigma, to the (40)K-(40)Ar dates. The results imply that deep weathering profiles along the eastern Brazilian margin do not reflect present climatic conditions but are the result of a long-term process that was already advanced by the late Miocene. Weathering ages predate pulses of continental sedimentation along the eastern Brazilian margin and suggest that there was a time lag between weathering and erosion processes and sedimentation processes."

Whether this ""convective"" instability is pivotal to the supernova mechanism, pulsar magnetic fields, or a host of other important issues that attend stellar collapse remains to be seen, but its existence promises to modify all questions concerning this most energetic of astronomical phenomena."
https://openalex.org/W1750583868,"This book was originally published prior to 1923, and represents a reproduction of an important historical work, maintaining the same format as the original work. While some publishers have opted to apply OCR (optical character recognition) technology to the process, we believe this leads to sub-optimal results (frequent typographical errors, strange characters and confusing formatting) and does not adequately preserve the historical character of the original artefact. We believe this work is culturally important in its original archival form. While we strive to adequately clean and digitally enhance the original work, there are occasionally instances where imperfections such as blurred or missing pages, poor pictures or errant marks may have been introduced due to either the quality of the original work or the scanning process itself. Despite these occasional imperfections, we have brought it back into print as part of our ongoing global book preservation commitment, providing customers with access to the best possible historical reprints. We appreciate your understanding of these occasional imperfections, and sincerely hope you enjoy seeing the book in a format as close as possible to that intended by the original publisher."
https://openalex.org/W2038425342,"A molecularly thin film of a two-dimensional polymer network formed by hydrogen bonding was synthesized and investigated with scanning tunneling microscopy. Poly(in-caprolactam) (nylon 6) was epitaxially grown on the basal plane of graphite and an ultrathin film of the polymer was obtained after the bulk materials had been washed away with solvents. The polymer chain has a planar, all-trans conformation and adjacent chains run in the antiparallel direction. This produces complete pairing of hydrogen bonding groups, with each amide group lying on a straight line perpendicular to the polymer backbone. This hydrogen-bonded sheet is oriented so that each polymer backbone lies in the (1010) direction on the graphite hexagonal lattice, as opposed to the (1120) direction taken by other paraffinic molecules studied so far. This experiment shows that hydrogen bonding can be used to control the orientation of macromolecules in two dimensions."

https://openalex.org/W2055517975,A method for continuous recording of gastric acidity is described which consists in the introduction into the stomach of the dog of a glass electrode connected with a pH meter and a recording potentiometer. Adequate mixing of the gastric contents is accomplished by the use of an automatic aspirating and injecting device. This method is suggested as a means of studying the effect of drugs and food in normal animals and those in an induced hypersecretory state. Its clinical applications will be reported later.

https://openalex.org/W2101469542,"Modern distance determinations to galaxies were reviewed and placed on a uniform and self-consistent scale. Based on eight separate but not entirely independent techniques, the distance to the Virgo cluster was found to be 15.8 ± 1.1 megaparsec. Twelve different determinations yield a Coma/Virgo distance ratio of 5.52 ± 0.13 and hence a Coma distance of 87 ± 6 megaparsec. With a cosmological redshift of 7210 kilometers per second, this gives a Hubble parameter H0 (local) of 83 ± 6 kilometers per second per megaparsec. From the velocity-distance relation of rich clusters of galaxies, the ratio of the value of H0 (global) to the value of H0 (local) was determined to be 0.92 ± 0.08. In other words, the cluster data do not show a statistically significant difference between the local and global values of the Hubble parameter. If one nevertheless adopts this relation between H0 (global) and H0 (local), then the value of H0 (global) is 76 ± 9 kilometers per second per megaparsec. This observed value differs at the ∼3σ level (where σ is the standard deviation of the distribution) from values in the range 36 ≲ H0 ≲ 50 kilometers per second per megaparsec, which are derived from stellar evolutionary theory in conjunction with standard cosmological models with a density parameter (ω) that is equal to 1 and a cosmological constant (λ) that is equal to 0."

Neither ordinary solids nor conventional small molecules, such atomic clusters have unique chemical, optical, and electronic properties. Since the mid-1970s, when advances in synthesizing and analyzing clusters first enabled researchers to explore this netherworld in earnest, clusters have nucleated a sizable field. Many of its participants gathered in Chicago on 15 to 22 September for the Sixth International Symposium on Small Particles and Inorganic Clusters, the first of the series to be held in the United States. At the top of the agenda for the 300 attendees were the field's old stalwarts, various kinds of metal clusters; its current darlings, the carbon clusters known as fullerenes; and a possible future superstar, silicon clusters."
