https://openalex.org/W1967250117,"The oxidation of water to dioxygen is catalyzed within photosystem II (PSII) by a Mn 4 Ca cluster, the structure of which remains elusive. Polarized extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) measurements on PSII single crystals constrain the Mn 4 Ca cluster geometry to a set of three similar high-resolution structures. Combining polarized EXAFS and x-ray diffraction data, the cluster was placed within PSII, taking into account the overall trend of the electron density of the metal site and the putative ligands. The structure of the cluster from the present study is unlike either the 3.0 or 3.5 angstrom–resolution x-ray structures or other previously proposed models."

Using synchrotron x-ray fluorescence microtomography to directly visualize iron in Arabidopsis seeds, we show that iron is localized primarily to the provascular strands of the embryo. This localization is completely abolished when the vacuolar iron uptake transporter VIT1 is disrupted. Vacuolar iron storage is also critical for seedling development because vit1-1 seedlings grow poorly when iron is limiting. We have uncovered a fundamental aspect of seed biology that will ultimately aid the development of nutrient-rich seed, benefiting both human health and agricultural productivity."
https://openalex.org/W2076870182,"Nuclear pore complexes permit rapid passage of cargoes bound to nuclear transport receptors, but otherwise suppress nucleocytoplasmic fluxes of inert macromolecules >/=30 kilodaltons. To explain this selectivity, a sieve structure of the permeability barrier has been proposed that is created through reversible cross-linking between Phe and Gly (FG)-rich nucleoporin repeats. According to this model, nuclear transport receptors overcome the size limit of the sieve and catalyze their own nuclear pore-passage by a competitive disruption of adjacent inter-repeat contacts, which transiently opens adjoining meshes. Here, we found that phenylalanine-mediated inter-repeat interactions indeed cross-link FG-repeat domains into elastic and reversible hydrogels. Furthermore, we obtained evidence that such hydrogel formation is required for viability in yeast."
https://openalex.org/W2091643574,"Mathematical reaction-diffusion models have been suggested to describe formation of animal pigmentation patterns and distribution of epidermal appendages. However, the crucial signals and in vivo mechanisms are still elusive. Here we identify WNT and its inhibitor DKK as primary determinants of murine hair follicle spacing, using a combined experimental and computational modeling approach. Transgenic DKK overexpression reduces overall appendage density. Moderate suppression of endogenous WNT signaling forces follicles to form clusters during an otherwise normal morphogenetic program. These results confirm predictions of a WNT/DKK-specific mathematical model and provide in vivo corroboration of the reaction-diffusion mechanism for epidermal appendage formation."

https://openalex.org/W2060256600,"Changes in gene regulation likely influenced the profound phenotypic divergence of humans from other mammals, but the extent of adaptive substitution in human regulatory sequences remains unknown. We identified 992 conserved noncoding sequences (CNSs) with a significant excess of human-specific substitutions. These accelerated elements were disproportionately found near genes involved in neuronal cell adhesion. To assess the uniqueness of human noncoding evolution, we examined CNSs accelerated in chimpanzee and mouse. Although we observed a similar enrichment near neuronal adhesion genes in chimpanzee, the accelerated CNSs themselves exhibited almost no overlap with those in human, suggesting independent evolution toward different neuronal phenotypes in each species. CNSs accelerated in mouse showed no bias toward neuronal cell adhesion. Our results indicate that widespread cis-regulatory changes in human evolution may have contributed to uniquely human features of brain development and function."

https://openalex.org/W2088863208,"Reduction of core body temperature has been proposed to contribute to the increased life span and the antiaging effects conferred by calorie restriction (CR). Validation of this hypothesis has been difficult in homeotherms, primarily due to a lack of experimental models. We report that transgenic mice engineered to overexpress the uncoupling protein 2 in hypocretin neurons (Hcrt-UCP2) have elevated hypothalamic temperature. The effects of local temperature elevation on the central thermostat resulted in a 0.3 degrees to 0.5 degrees C reduction of the core body temperature. Fed ad libitum, Hcrt-UCP2 transgenic mice had the same caloric intake as their wild-type littermates but had increased energy efficiency and a greater median life span (12% increase in males; 20% increase in females). Thus, modest, sustained reduction of core body temperature prolonged life span independent of altered diet or CR."
https://openalex.org/W1982388830,"The angiogenic growth factor angiopoietin 2 (Ang2) destabilizes blood vessels, enhances vascular leak and induces vascular regression and endothelial cell apoptosis. We considered that Ang2 might be important in hyperoxic acute lung injury (ALI). Here we have characterized the responses in lungs induced by hyperoxia in wild-type and Ang2-/- mice or those given either recombinant Ang2 or short interfering RNA (siRNA) targeted to Ang2. During hyperoxia Ang2 expression is induced in lung epithelial cells, while hyperoxia-induced oxidant injury, cell death, inflammation, permeability alterations and mortality are ameliorated in Ang2-/- and siRNA-treated mice. Hyperoxia induces and activates the extrinsic and mitochondrial cell death pathways and activates initiator and effector caspases through Ang2-dependent pathways in vivo. Ang2 increases inflammation and cell death during hyperoxia in vivo and stimulates epithelial necrosis in hyperoxia in vitro. Ang2 in plasma and alveolar edema fluid is increased in adults with ALI and pulmonary edema. Tracheal Ang2 is also increased in neonates that develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Ang2 is thus a mediator of epithelial necrosis with an important role in hyperoxic ALI and pulmonary edema."
https://openalex.org/W2012832111,"The effect of ocean biological productivity on marine clouds is explored over a large phytoplankton bloom in the Southern Ocean with the use of remotely sensed data. Cloud droplet number concentration over the bloom was twice what it was away from the bloom, and cloud effective radius was reduced by 30%. The resulting change in the short-wave radiative flux at the top of the atmosphere was –15 watts per square meter, comparable to the aerosol indirect effect over highly polluted regions. This observed impact of phytoplankton on clouds is attributed to changes in the size distribution and chemical composition of cloud condensation nuclei. We propose that secondary organic aerosol, formed from the oxidation of phytoplankton-produced isoprene, can affect chemical composition of marine cloud condensation nuclei and influence cloud droplet number. Model simulations support this hypothesis, indicating that 100% of the observed changes in cloud properties can be attributed to the isoprene secondary organic aerosol."

Treatment could be improved by bioartificial liver (BAL) support, but this approach is hindered by a shortage of human hepatocytes. To generate an alternative source of cells for BAL support, we differentiated mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells into hepatocytes by coculture with a combination of human liver nonparenchymal cell lines and fibroblast growth factor-2, human activin-A and hepatocyte growth factor. Functional hepatocytes were isolated using albumin promoter–based cell sorting. ES cell–derived hepatocytes expressed liver-specific genes, secreted albumin and metabolized ammonia, lidocaine and diazepam. Treatment of 90% hepatectomized mice with a subcutaneously implanted BAL seeded with ES cell–derived hepatocytes or primary hepatocytes improved liver function and prolonged survival, whereas treatment with a BAL seeded with control cells did not. After functioning in the BAL, ES cell–derived hepatocytes developed characteristics nearly identical to those of primary hepatocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1979333743,"We developed an efficient model for responsive gels that captures large-scale, two-dimensional (2D) deformations and chemical reactions within a swollen polymer network. The 2D calculations allowed us to probe not only volume changes but also changes in sample shape. By focusing on gels undergoing the oscillatory Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction, we observed traveling waves of local swelling that form a rich variety of dynamic patterns and give rise to distinctive oscillations in the gel's shape. The observed patterns depend critically on the gel's dimensions. The approach provides a useful computational tool for probing the dynamics of chemomechanical processes and uncovering morphological transformations in responsive gels."
https://openalex.org/W1996851294,"Chirally sensitive measurement techniques have generally been restricted to bulk samples. Here, we report the observation of fluorescence-detected circular dichroism (FDCD) from single (bridgedtriarylamine) helicene molecules by using an excitation wavelength (457 nanometers) in the vicinity of an electronic transition that shows circular dichroism in bulk samples. The distributions of dissymmetry ( g ) parameters by analysis of signals from pure M - and P -type diastereomers are almost perfect mirror images of one another, each spanning a range of both positive and negative values. In addition, we observe a well-defined structure in the histogram of dissymmetry parameters suggestive of specific molecular orientations at the polymer interface. These single-molecule results highlight strong intrinsic circular dichroism responses that can be obscured by cancellation effects in ensemble measurements of a randomly oriented bulk sample."
https://openalex.org/W1988654486,"Endochondral ossification is recapitulated during bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-induced ectopic bone formation. Although BMP and β-catenin have been investigated in bone development and in mesenchymal cells, how they interact in this process is not clear. We implanted recombinant BMP-2 into the muscle of mice to investigate the effect of β-catenin signaling on BMP-induced in vivo endochondral bone formation. BMP-2 induced expression of several Wnt ligands and their receptors and also activated β-catenin-mediated T cell factor-dependent transcriptional activity. An adenovirus expressing Dickkopf-1 (Dkk-1, an inhibitor of canonical Wnt pathway) inhibited β-catenin signaling and endochondral bone formation. Interestingly, Dkk-1 inhibited both chondrogenesis and osteogenesis. Likewise, mice expressing conditional β-catenin null alleles also displayed an inhibition of BMP-induced chondrogenesis and osteogenesis. This is in contrast to studies of embryonic skeletogenesis, which demonstrate that β-catenin is required for osteogenesis but is dispensable for chondrogenesis. These findings suggest that embryonic development pathways are not always recapitulated during post-natal regenerative processes, and the biochemical pathways utilized to regulate cell differentiation may be different.

During in vivo ectopic bone formation, BMP-2 induces β-catenin-mediated signaling through Wnt ligands, and β-catenin is required for both chondrogenesis and osteogenesis. Bone arises from condensation of undifferentiated mesenchymal stem cells during embryogenesis. Bone develops through two different mechanisms, endochondral and intramembranous ossification (1Karsenty G. Dev. Genet. 1998; 22: 301-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Endochondral bone develops from a cartilaginous template forming by the recruitment and condensation of mesenchymal cells, which differentiate into chondrocytes. Cartilage is then replaced with osteoblasts and bone matrix. Endochondral bone formation gives rise to the axial and appendicular portions of the skeleton and is recapitulated during fracture repair (2Chen Q. Johnson D.M. Haudenschild D.R. Goetinck P.F. Dev. Biol. 1995; 172: 293-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 3Cohen Jr., M.M. J. Craniofac. Genet. Dev. Biol. 2000; 20: 84-93PubMed Google Scholar). Intramembranous ossification occurs by direct formation of bone, bypassing the cartilaginous template. A variety of signaling pathways have been investigated in endochondral bone development, including Wnt signaling and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) 3The abbreviations used are: BMP, bone morphogenetic protein; ALP, alkaline phosphatase; Dkk, dickkopf; Fz, Frizzled; HE, hematoxylin-eosin; GSK-3β, glycogen synthase kinase 3β; Lrp, low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein; SO, Safranin O; Tcf, T cell factor; Lef, lymphoid enhancer factor; GFP, green fluorescent protein; RT, reverse transcription; PKC, protein kinase C. 3The abbreviations used are: BMP, bone morphogenetic protein; ALP, alkaline phosphatase; Dkk, dickkopf; Fz, Frizzled; HE, hematoxylin-eosin; GSK-3β, glycogen synthase kinase 3β; Lrp, low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein; SO, Safranin O; Tcf, T cell factor; Lef, lymphoid enhancer factor; GFP, green fluorescent protein; RT, reverse transcription; PKC, protein kinase C. signaling (4DeLise A.M.

Birth Defects Res. C Embryo Today. 2003; 69: 305-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 7Akiyama T. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2000; 11: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). This pathway consists of secreted ligands (Wnts) and various secreted and membrane-bound antagonists of Wnt signaling. These components activate transmembrane receptors such as low density lipoprotein receptor related protein-5/6 (Lrp-5/6) and Frizzleds (Fzs). There are at least three different Wnt signaling pathways, including the canonical Wnt pathway, which regulates β-catenin, the planar cell polarity pathway, and the Wnt/Ca2+ pathway.Signaling through the canonical Wnt pathway is initiated by Wnt ligands activating Fzs and Lrp-5/6. In the absence of appropriate Wnt ligands, β-catenin is targeted for phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and proteosomal degradation by a multiprotein complex comprising glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β), APC, and Axin (8Behrens J.

In the presence of an appropriate Wnt ligand, this multiprotein complex does not target β-catenin for degradation, and β-catenin can translocate to the nucleus, where in concert with members of the T cell-factor/lymphoid-enhancer-factor (Tcf/Lef) family, activates the transcription of a wide range of genes.Studies on embryonic skeletogenesis have demonstrated that Wnt/β-catenin signaling represents a mechanism in mesenchymal precursor cells for selecting between chondrocytic and osteoblastic fates. For example, based on experiments with loss- and gain-of-function alleles of β-catenin, Hill et al. (11Hill T.P. Spater D. Taketo M.M. Birchmeier W. Hartmann C. Dev. Cell. 2005; 8: 727-738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar) demonstrated that β-catenin is required to repress chondrocytic differentiation. In the absence of β-catenin, progenitor cells differentiated into chondrocytes instead of osteoblasts (11Hill T.P. Spater D. Taketo M.M. Birchmeier W. Hartmann C. Dev.

Some BMPs have demonstrated their ability to induce ectopic bone formation, such as BMP-2. When administered in skeletal muscle, BMP-2 induces bone formation via an endochondral mechanism (15Sakou T.

Although previous studies have investigated BMP, Wnt, β-catenin, and their interactions in mesenchymal cells, the role of these factors, and their interactions in endochondral bone formation is not completely elucidated. Furthermore, the role of Wnt and β-catenin in ectopic ossification in mature tissues in vivo is unknown. In this study, we aim at investigating the role of β-catenin signaling pathway in BMP-2-induced in vivo ectopic endochondral bone formation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBMP-2 and Dkk-1—Human recombinant BMP-2 (rhBMP-2) was obtained from ProSpec-Tany TechnoGene (Rehovot, Israel). Adenovirus harboring murine Dickkopf-1 (Dkk-1) cDNA and C-terminal His6 and Flag epitope tags (Ad-Dkk1) was generated as previously described (18Kuhnert F. Davis C.R. Wang H.T. Chu P. Lee M. Yuan J. Nusse R. Kuo C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 266-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Dkk-1 is a secreted protein that binds to Lrp-5/6 and Kremen proteins, thus inducing Lrp endocytosis, which prevents the formation of Wnt-Fz-Lrp5/6 receptor complexes and blocks canonical Wnt signaling (19Glinka A.

These mice possess loxP sites located in introns 1 and 6 of the β-catenin (Catnbfloxed/floxed) gene, resulting into conditional Catnb deletion when treated with a Cre recombinase.

A 5-mm skin incision was made on the dorsal surface of the right lower limb, and a muscle pouch was produced in the gluteus of mice. Freeze-dried collagen type I sponges (Helistat), 5 × 5 x 5 mm3 in size, were loaded with 30 μg of rhBMP-2 or with same volume of phosphate-buffered saline as a control were placed into the muscle pouch. For adenovirus treatment, animals were injected with Ad-Dkk1, Ad-Cre, and Ad-GFP (control), respectively, at a dosage of 109 plaque-forming units per mouse 2 days before BMP-2 implantation.At 3 days, 1, 2, and 3 weeks after operation, mice were sacrificed. Tissues from the site of BMP implantation were harvested, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, decalcified in 20% EDTA (pH 7.4), and embedded in paraffin. Sections were prepared stained using hematoxylin-eosin (HE) and Safranin O (SO). For RNA analysis, RNA was isolated using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen). Proteins were extracted using Tissue PE LB buffer (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's protocol.Immunohistochemistry and β-Galactosidase Assay—For immunostaining, tissue sections were de-paraffinized, dehydrated, rinsed, and incubated with 0.3% H2O2 for 20 min, 3% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min to block nonspecific staining. A goat anti-mouse collagen type II or human anti-mouse collagen type X polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a dilution of 1:50 was added to each section and incubated at 4 °C overnight.

To address the role of β-catenin in BMP induced in vivo bone formation, we implanted rhBMP-2/collagen complex into the hindlimb muscle of Tcf reporter mice and observed changes in Tcf-transcriptional activity using LacZ staining.Three days after implantation, undifferentiated fibroblast-like mesenchymal cells were present on the surface of the BMP/sponge complex. None of these cells demonstrated LacZ staining (Fig. 1, A and E). One week following implantation, cells with cytologic characteristics of prechondrogenic mesenchymal cells or premature chondrocytes were present, and these cells exhibited LacZ staining. Other cells with cytologic characteristics of mature, prehypertrophic and hypertrophic chondrocytes did not exhibit staining (Fig. 1, B and F). Two weeks after BMP implantation, woven bone developed, characterized by trabeculae structure and marrow cavity containing bone marrow-like cells and adipocyte-like cells. At this stage, LacZ staining was present in the osteoblast-like cells. However, the intensity of staining became fainter in regions of more mature appearing bone (Fig. 1, C and G). At 3 weeks, the bone matrix became more mature, and positive staining was present in osteoblasts and in adipocyte-like cells in the marrow cavity. However, there was a low level staining in the fully differentiated osteocytes (Fig. 1, D and H). Seven weeks after BMP-2 implantation, only slight LacZ staining was detected in osteoblasts lining the trabeculae and cortical matrix. The staining was also greatly decreased in adipocytes (data not shown). Implantation of the collagen sponge alone resulted in limited accumulation of fibroblast-like cells at the implantation site, with only very mild LacZ staining in these cells. These results suggested that β-catenin-mediated Tcf-dependent transcription is activated during BMP-2 induction of endochondral bone formation, in particular, during early chondrogenesis (but not late stage of chondrogenesis) and throughout osteogenesis.To determine the level of expression of β-catenin during these processes, we analyzed protein extracts from tissues harvested at different time period using Western analysis. As shown in Fig. 1I, β-catenin protein level increased starting following implantation of BMP-2, peaking at 1 week after implantation. The expression of β-catenin was also maintained at high level at 2 and 3 weeks after surgery, the time point when osteogenesis proceeds. These data suggested that the expression of β-catenin peaks at the stage of chondrogenesis, during endochondral ossification.BMP-2 Induces Expression of Wnt Ligands and Receptors— To determine whether BMP regulates β-catenin by altering the expression of Wnt ligands, we examined the expression of Wnt ligands and frizzled or Lrp receptors using RT-PCR in primary calvarial cultures from the Tcf reporter mice. BMP-2 causes osteoblast differentiation, as confirmed by increased mRNA for both alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and osteocalcin, genes which are marker of osteoblast differentiation (Fig. 2A). Using semiquantitative RT-PCR, in which expression was compared with the housekeeping gene, β2-macroglobin, we found that the expression of Wnt signaling family members was up-regulated by BMP-2. BMP-2 treatment increased expression of Wnt-7a, Wnt-10b, Wnt-11, and Wnt-13 mRNA in a dose-dependent manner. In a similar manner, expression of the Wnt receptors, Fz-1, Fz-3, Fz-10, and Lrp-6, was also increased with BMP-2 treatment (Fig. 2B). The protein level of β-catenin, as measured using Western analysis, showed a dose-dependent increase after BMP-2 treatment (Fig. 2C). Accordingly, β-catenin-mediated Tcf-dependent transcription was also activated after BMP-2 treatment, as detected using the β-galactosidase activity assay (Fig. 2D). Taken together, these data suggested an activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling during BMP-2-mediated osteoblast differentiation.FIGURE 2Canonical Wnt signaling is activated by BMP-2 during osteoblast differentiation. Primary calvarial osteoblast cells were treated with rhBMP-2 at different dosages (0, 100, and 400 ng/ml) for 24 h. Expression was examined using semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis, and protein levels were determined using Western analysis. β-Galactosidase activity was used to determine β-catenin-mediated Tcf-dependent transcriptional activity.

Nadessan P. Poon R. Alman B.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 293: 267-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). To investigate whether BMP-2 has an effect on GSK-3β, we examined expression of GSK-3β and its Ser-9 phosphorylated form during BMP-induced bone formation. As shown in Fig. 3A, there was a significant increase in phosphorylated GSK-3β relative to total GSK-3β level at 3 days and 1 week after implantation, which strongly correlated with increased β-catenin protein levels. Thus, BMP-2 could regulate GSK-3β in a manner consistent with canonical Wnt signaling activation during in vivo bone formation.FIGURE 3Canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling is induced by BMP-2 during ectopic bone formation. BMP-2 at a dosage of 30 μg was implanted into the muscle of wild-type mice. Samples were harvested at different time point. Cell lysates were isolated and examined by Western analysis. A, expression of total GSK-3β- and Ser-9-phosphorylated GSK-3β protein level; B, expression of Wnt-5a and PKC-α protein level. The level of expression of the Ser-9-phosphorylated form of GSK-3β was higher at early stages (i.e. 3 days and 1 week time point) than at late stages (i.e. 2 and 3 week time point) during ectopic bone formation. Wnt-5a and PKC-α were detected after BMP implantation during the early stages (3 days and 1 week time point), and expression levels decreased as the cartilage replaced by bone at the later stages.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Since Wnt can act through canonical and non-canonical pathways, we also investigated expression of Wnt-5a and PKC-α from bone samples.

As shown in Fig. 3B, significantly higher expression of Wnt-5a and PKC-α were detected after BMP implantation during the period in which primarily cartilage is formed and that the expression level gradually decreased as cartilage replaced by bone starting from 2 weeks time point. Thus, it is possible that non-canonical Wnt signaling plays a role during chondrogenesis.Conditional Inactivation of β-Catenin Inhibits in Vivo Chondrogenesis and Osteogenesis Induced by BMP-2—To determine the function of β-catenin in BMP-2-induced endochondral bone formation, we conditionally inactivated the β-catenin gene using injection of Ad-Cre into the muscle of Catnbfloxed/floxed transgenic mice 2 days before BMP implantation. β-Catenin level was reduced to roughly half of control animals with expression of the Ad-Cre (data not shown). These animals exhibited a substantially reduced chondrogenic differentiation at 1 week after BMP-2 treatment, characterized by significantly less cartilaginous matrix (Fig. 4, A-C and G-I). Immunostaining demonstrated that mice expressing the conditional β-catenin null alleles showed low levels of expression of type II (Fig. 5, A, C, D, and F) and type X collagen (Fig. 6, A, C, D, and F). Although some bone tissue and bone marrow were present 3 weeks following implantation, the bone volume was dramatically reduced as compared with mice expressing wild-type β-catenin alleles (Fig. 7, A-C and G-I). In contrast to previous studies of the role of β-catenin during embryonic bone development, these data show that β-catenin is required for osteogenesis as well as chondrogenesis during BMP-2-induced bone formation.FIGURE 4Chondrogenesis induced by BMP-2 is inhibited by Dkk-1 or by expression of conditional null alleles of β-catenin.

https://openalex.org/W2011005136,"Guanosine triphosphatases of the Rab family are key regulators of membrane trafficking, with Rab11 playing a specific role in membrane recycling. We identified a mammalian protein, protrudin, that promoted neurite formation through interaction with the guanosine diphosphate (GDP)-bound form of Rab11. Phosphorylation of protrudin by extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in response to nerve growth factor promoted protrudin association with Rab11-GDP. Down-regulation of protrudin by RNA interference induced membrane extension in all directions and inhibited neurite formation. Thus, protrudin regulates Rab11-dependent membrane recycling to promote the directional membrane trafficking required for neurite formation."

https://openalex.org/W2076305288,"Smad proteins transduce bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) signals upon phosphorylation of their C-terminal SXS motif by receptor kinases. The activity of Smad1 in the BMP pathway and Smad2/3 in the TGFβ pathway is restricted by pathway cross-talk and feedback through protein kinases, including MAPK, CDK2/4, p38MAPK, JNK, and others. These kinases phosphorylate Smads 1-3 at the region that links the N-terminal DNA-binding domain and the C-terminal transcriptional domain. Phosphatases that dephosphorylate the linker region are therefore likely to play an integral part in the regulation of Smad activity. We reported previously that small C-terminal domain phosphatases 1, 2, and 3 (SCP1-3) dephosphorylate Smad1 C-terminal tail, thereby attenuating BMP signaling. Here we provide evidence that SCP1-3 also dephosphorylate the linker regions of Smad1 and Smad2/3 in vitro, in mammalian cells and in Xenopus embryos. Overexpression of SCP 1, 2, or 3 decreased linker phosphorylation of Smads 1, 2 and 3. Moreover, RNA interference-mediated knockdown of SCP1/2 increased the BMP-dependent phosphorylation of the Smad1 linker region as well as the C terminus. In contrast, SCP1/2 knockdown increased the TGFβ-dependent linker phosphorylation of Smad2/3 but not the C-terminal phosphorylation. Consequently, SCP1/2 knockdown inhibited TGFβ transcriptional responses, but it enhanced BMP transcriptional responses. Thus, by dephosphorylating Smad2/3 at the linker (inhibitory) but not the C-terminal (activating) site, the SCPs enhance TGFβ signaling, and by dephosphorylating Smad1 at both sites, the SCPs reset Smad1 to the basal unphosphorylated state."

In this process, an important role is played by megaparsec (Mpc)-scale cosmic shock waves, arising in gravity-driven supersonic flows of intergalactic matter onto dark matter-dominated collapsing structures such as pancakes, filaments, and clusters of galaxies. Here, we report Very Large Array telescope observations of giant (~2 Mpc by 1.6 Mpc), ring-shaped nonthermal radio-emitting structures, found at the outskirts of the rich cluster of galaxies Abell 3376. These structures may trace the elusive shock waves of cosmological large-scale matter flows, which are energetic enough to power them.

Similarly, myelination by Schwann cells is polarized, but the mechanisms involved remain unclear. Here, we show that the polarity protein Par-3 localizes asymmetrically in Schwann cells at the axon-glial junction and that disruption of Par-3 localization, by overexpression and knockdown, inhibits myelination. Additionally, we show that Par-3 directly associates and recruits the p75 neurotrophin receptor to the axon-glial junction, forming a complex necessary for myelination. Together, these results point to a critical role in the establishment of cell polarity for myelination."

A variety of proteins have been shown to interact with IQGAP1, including the small G proteins Rac1 and Cdc42, actin, calmodulin, β-catenin, the microtubule plus end-binding proteins CLIP170 (cytoplasmic linker protein) and adenomatous polyposis coli. However, the molecular mechanism by which IQGAP1 controls actin dynamics in cell motility is not understood. Quantitative co-localization analysis and down-regulation of IQGAP1 revealed that IQGAP1 controls the co-localization of N-WASP with the Arp2/3 complex in lamellipodia. Co-immunoprecipitation supports an in vivo link between IQGAP1 and N-WASP. Pull-down experiments and kinetic assays of branched actin polymerization with N-WASP and Arp2/3 complex demonstrated that the C-terminal half of IQGAP1 activates N-WASP by interacting with its BR-CRIB domain in a Cdc42-like manner, whereas the N-terminal half of IQGAP1 antagonizes this activation by association with a C-terminal region of IQGAP1.

The detailed upstream regulation and the contribution of the different members of the WASP family proteins in cell protrusion and motility is an open issue. Here we show that the C-terminal half of IQGAP1 activates N-WASP in a Cdc42-like fashion and that this activity is abolished by an intramolecular interaction between N- and C-terminal halves suggesting that the relief of the autoinhibited fold of IQGAP1 in turn triggers unfolding and activation of N-WASP, which leads to Arp2/3-dependent actin filament branching. This mechanism emphasizes that signaling to motile events occurs through cooperative cascades of protein unfolding in membrane-associated protein complexes. Antibodies—Anti N-WASP antibody was a gift from J. Peterson: NW011 (33Egile C. Loisel T.P. Laurent V. Li R. Pantaloni D. Sansonetti P.J. Carlier M.F. J.

Benesch S. Rottner K. Franz T. Wehland J. Kuhn R. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 850-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The construction of pGEX4T-1-VCA (residues 392-501 of human N-WASP) was described in a previous study (33Egile C. Loisel T.P. Laurent V. Li R. Pantaloni D. Sansonetti P.J. Carlier M.F. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1319-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). pFastBacHTa-N-WASP was prepared by PCR using a human cDNA and the following primers CLC-NW-3 (5′-CCG GAA TTC ATG AGC TCC GTC CAG CAG CAG CCG-3′) and CLC-NW-4 (5′-CCG CAA GCT TCA GTC TTC CCA CTC ATC ATC ATC-3′). This cDNA was cloned into a pFastBacHTa vector (Invitrogen) using EcoRI/HindIII cloning sites. BR-CRIB fragments were amplified by PfuI polymerase using primers phNW142-phNW276 and pFASTBac-NWASP as template. N-WASP BR-CRIB (amino acids 142-276) cDNA was digested with EcoRI and XhoI and cloned into pGEX4T-1. The fidelity of the constructs was confirmed by sequencing. Cloning of ΔWH1-N-WASP, ΔB-N-WASP, and N-WASP/H208D were previously described (32Rohatgi R. Ma L. Miki H. Lopez M. Kirchhausen T. Takenawa T. Kirschner M.W.

Human GST-IQGAP1-C5 (amino acids 675-1657) was created by PCR (fragments 1-3: 2023-2355, 2320-4129, and 3908-4950 bp) followed by in vivo recombination in yeast. Briefly, PCR fragments, including the restriction sites XmaI/SacII/XhoI and XbaI, were co-transformed into yeast together with a BamHI linearized yeast shuttle vector pCJ36. 7Y. Barral, unpublished data. The resulting vector was used for re-cloning IQGAP1-C5 into pGEX-6P1. The fidelity of the construct was confirmed by sequencing. Cell Culture and Immunofluorescence—MDCK cells were seeded on coverslips and grown in minimal essential medium (Sigma) containing 10% fetal calf serum (Cambrex), 1 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine (Invitrogen). After 24 h cells were starved in medium without fetal calf serum. 16 h later cells were stimulated with minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal calf serum for 10 min, fixed at 37 °C, and stained with primary antibodies against Arp3, IQGAP1, and N-WASP followed by secondary antibodies conjugated with Coumarin Phalloidin, Alexa488, Alexa594, or Alexa647 (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen). Co-localization data originate from multichannel fluorescence XY stacks of islands containing 2-6 cells, which were collected using a confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica TCP-SP2 AOBS, Leica Microsystems). All images were recorded with a high resolution oil immersion objective (PlanApo, 63×, numerical aperture 1.4, Leica) tuning the sampling density to meet the requirements of the Nyquist theorem. In two-color specimens, Alexa488 fluorescence was excited with the 488 nm line of an argon laser and collected in the 495-580 nm optical window, whereas, in parallel, Alexa594 fluorescence was excited with the 594 nm line of an HeNe laser and collected in the 605-770 nm optical window. In three-color specimens serial intra-frame acquisition of the three fluorescence channels was necessary to minimize crosstalk between Alexa594 and Alexa647 fluorescence emissions. First, Alexa488 fluorescence was excited with the 488 nm line of an argon laser and collected in the 495-580 nm optical window, whereas, in parallel, Alexa647 fluorescence was excited with the 633 nm line of an HeNe laser and collected in the 650-800 nm optical window. Second, Alexa594 fluorescence was excited with the 561 nm line of a HeNe laser and collected in the 605-770 nm optical window. Crosstalk between fluorescence channels was assessed in one-color specimens, and the best optical settings were designed with the help of the Fluorescence Spectra Viewer (Molecular Probes) to reduce crosstalk values to <5% maximum intensity. In all specimens an additional transmission channel was recorded in parallel to visualize the two-dimensional profile of the cells under study. Laser intensities and channel gains were tuned to minimize photobleaching and to obtain similar signal to noise ratios in the fluorescence channels. Image Processing and Co-localization Measurement—Image processing and deconvolution were done with the Huygens software package (Scientific Volume Imaging) imposing the optical parameters used to collect the fluorescence XY stacks. Deconvolution was necessary to remove background and other optical artifacts (e.g. chromatic aberration) that can introduce false positive or false negative voxels in the co-localization analysis (49Landmann L. J. Microsc. 2002; 208: 134-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Deconvolved XY stacks were loaded in the Huygens essential version 7.1 and analyzed as follows. An individual cell in the cell island was cropped in three-dimensions using the “crop” tool of Huygens. A region of interest (ROI) was then defined using the “object analyzer tool” of Huygens and than exported to the XY stack under analysis. A careful definition of the ROI was obtained, for each cell in the island, manually outlining on the two-dimensional projection a 3-μm thick closed line from the edge toward the cell cytoplasm. The extracellular voxels selected above and below the cell in the ROI drawn were removed using the crop tool of Huygens to obtain a refined ROI. The cellular voxels selected in this way, containing only the fluorescence signal from the cell's leading edge, represented the functional co-localization of the proteins under study and thus needed to be measured. The channel co-localization in these voxels was measured using the “co-localization analyzer tool” of Huygens. For each cell a single value of the Pearson's coefficient in the refined ROI was measured imposing a threshold value for both channels. The threshold was calculated on both channels based on an algorithm implemented in the Imaris software package (Bit-plane) and obtained using the “automatic thresholding” function of Imaris. Around 20 cells from islands of 2-6 cells were measured per condition. Unspecific co-localization was calculated for each deconvolved XY stack selecting an ROI outside the cell island containing appreciatively the same number of voxels as the cellular ROI and measuring the relative Pearson's coefficient as described above. This value accounted for residual crosstalk between the two channels and for unspecific antibody clustering in the specimen and was back-subtracted from the Pearson's coefficients measured in the cellular ROIs. siRNA—RNA oligonucleotides containing 21 nucleotides in sense and antisense direction were designed according to dog IQGAP1 (accession number: XM_536199). SiIQGAP1 (sense sequence: UGAAGCCAUUGACCAUAGAdTdT) and the Scramble oligonucleotide (sense sequence: UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUdTdT) were from Qiagen. A second IQGAP1 specific siRNA oligonucleotide was used, and comparable results were obtained. MDCK cells were transfected twice using HiPerfect transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Statistical Analysis—Statistical comparisons of Pearson's coefficients measured in individual cells from two to three independent specimens were performed with a one-tailed two-sample t test (α = 0.05) for all data sets (Figs. 1E, 1F, 1G, and 2B) using the “Two Sample t-Test” function of the software OriginPro. Normal distribution of the data sets could be assessed with a Shapiro-Wilk test (α = 0.05) using the “Normality Test” function of OriginPro. Statistical significance was further verified using the more stringent two-tailed non-parametric Mann-Whitney test. This test (α = 0.05) on data sets presented in Fig. 1 (E-G) confirmed a significantly increased co-localization upon serum stimulation between IQGAP1/N-WASP (p < 0.0001), between Arp3 and IQGAP1 (p < 0.0001), and between Arp3 and N-WASP (p = 0.002). Two-tailed Mann-Whitney tests (α = 0.05) on data sets presented in Fig. 2B confirmed a significantly decreased co-localization between Arp3 and N-WASP in siIQGAP1-treated cells (p = 0.0078).FIGURE 2IQGAP1 regulates N-WASP and Arp2/3 co-localization in lamellipodia. A, the expression level of IQGAP1 was specifically reduced after siRNA treatment targeting IQGAP1 (siIQGAP1) when compared with IQGAP1, N-WASP, and actin levels. B, quantification of Arp3/N-WASP co-localization in lamellipodia. Depicted is the 5-95 percentile distribution of the Pearson colocalization coefficients (as Fig. 1, E-G) in control (Scramble)-treated and siIQGAP1 cells. The population mean is reported as a horizontal black line enclosed in a rectangular box whose vertical length represents the S.E. Statistical p value of one-tailed t-tests is depicted. C, single slices of confocal XY stacks reporting the distribution of Arp3, N-WASP, and IQGAP1 in lamellipodia after serum stimulation of MDCK cells treated with nonspecific siRNA (Scramble) and with siIQGAP1 to down-regulate IQGAP1. Arp3 (upper row), N-WASP (middle row), and IQGAP1 (lower row), accumulated in lamellipodia (white arrowheads) only in control-treated cells (Scramble), whereas N-WASP and Arp3 localized like in starved cells (Fig. 1, B-D), and IQGAP1 signals were reduced to background levels.

Pantaloni D. Sansonetti P.J. Carlier M.F. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1319-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar), respectively. His-IQGAP-N2, -C3, and GST-tagged IQGAP1-C1, -C4, -C5, and -N2 were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS and induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The cells were harvested in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2), sonicated, and centrifuged for 30 min at 11,000 rpm. All affinity purification steps were done according to the bead manufacturer's instructions. Various fragments of IQGAP1 and N-WASP were expressed in E. coli as GST fusions using pGEX-6P-1 and purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads. GST was cleaved off using PreScission protease (Amersham Biosciences). His-tagged proteins were purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (Qiagen). GST-VCA was thrombin-cleaved (Sigma). Immunoprecipitation—HEK 293 cells were transfected with various GFP-tagged proteins using Effectene. Cells were lysed in NETN buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, at 4 °C, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1.4 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 mm sodium vanadate, 40 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 μm leupeptin, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonylfluoride hydrochloride, 1 mm dithiothreitol) on ice for 5 min. Cells were scraped and pelleted. 40 μl of the supernatant was used for detection of transfected proteins, 250 μl was used to immunoprecipitate the GFP-tagged proteins (anti-GFP antibody, Molecular Probes), and the rest was used to immunoprecipitate endogenous IQGAP1 (anti-IQGAP1 antibody) overnight. Afterward 20 μl of NETN buffer equilibrated protein A-Sepharose was added, and rotation was continued for another 3 h. Protein A-Sepharose was pelleted, the supernatant was aspirated, and beads were washed in NETN buffer. Protein A-Sepharose was boiled in SDS-loading buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting. Actin Polymerization Fluorescent Assay—Actin polymerization was monitored by the increase in fluorescence of 10% pyrenyl-labeled actin. Actin polymerization was induced by addition of 100 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.2 mm EGTA to a solution of Ca-ATP-G-actin in G buffer (5 mm Tris-Cl-, pH 7.8, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing the desired proteins. Fluorescence measurements were carried out in a Safas spectrofluorometer. Maximal rates of polymerization were measured at half-polymerization time. Relative activation of N-WASP by IQGAP1, R, was calculated as follows: R = (Vx - Vmin)/(Vmax - Vmin) in which Vx is the maximal rate of polymerization in the presence of a given concentration of IQGAP1 and 87 nm N-WASP, Vmin is the maximal rate of polymerization in the absence of IQGAP1 and 87 nm N-WASP, and Vmax is the maximal rate of polymerization at saturation of 87 nm N-WASP by IQGAP1. Observation of Branched Actin Filaments—Actin (2.5 μm) was polymerized in the presence of 25 nm Arp2/3 and 175 nm N-WASP in the absence or presence of 600 nm IQGAP1-C4. As soon as 90% polymerization was reached actin filaments were stabilized and stained with a molar equivalent of Alexa488-Phalloidin, diluted 120-fold in 5 mm Tris-Cl-, pH 7.8, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, and 0.1% methyl cellulose and processed for observation in an Olympus AX-70 microscope with a 100× objective and a Cascade II video camera (Photometrics). The density of branching was defined as the number of branches formed per unit length of filaments, counting a total length of at least 5000 μm. The length was measured using a Metamorph software while branches were counted manually. The experiment was reproduced three times with the same result. IQGAP1 Co-localizes with an Actin Polymerization Machinery in Newly Formed Lamellipodia—Serum stimulation of living cells activates a plethora of signaling pathways leading to site-directed actin assembly that drives membrane ruffling and lamellipodia extension. We observed that newly polymerized actin co-localized with Arp3 and IQGAP1 (Fig. 1A). Therefore,"

Mice deficient in α-actinin-4 develop a recessive phenotype characterized by kidney failure, proteinuria, glomerulosclerosis, and retraction of glomerular podocyte foot processes. However, the mechanism by which α-actinin-4 deficiency leads to glomerular disease has not been defined. Here, we examined the effect of α-actinin-4 deficiency on the adhesive properties of podocytes in vivo and in a cell culture system. In α-actinin-4-deficient mice, we observed a decrease in the number of podocytes per glomerulus compared with wild-type mice as well as the presence of podocyte markers in the urine. Podocyte cell lines generated from α-actinin-4-deficient mice were less adherent than wild-type cells to glomerular basement membrane (GBM) components collagen IV and laminin 10 and 11. We also observed markedly reduced adhesion of α-actinin-4-deficient podocytes under increasing shear stresses. This adhesion deficit was restored by transfecting cells with α-actinin-4-GFP. We tested the strength of the integrin receptor-mediated linkages to the cytoskeleton by applying force to microbeads bound to integrin using magnetic pulling cytometry. Beads bound toα-actinin-4-deficient podocytes showed greater displacement in response to an applied force than those bound to wild-type cells. Consistent with integrin-dependent α-actinin-4-mediated adhesion, phosphorylation of β1-integrins on α-actinin-4-deficient podocytes is reduced. We rescued the phosphorylation deficit by transfecting α-actinin-4 into α-actinin-4-deficient podocytes. These results suggest that α-actinin-4 interacts with integrins and strengthens the podocyte-GBM interaction thereby stabilizing glomerular architecture and preventing disease.

By contrast, the FSGS gene ACTN4 encodes an actin-associated cytoskeletal protein α-actinin-4 that colocalizes with the actin bundles extending along the center of the podocyte extensions known as foot processes (12Kaplan J.M. Kim S.H. North K.N. Rennke H. Correia L.A. Tong H.Q. Mathis B.J. Rodriguez-Perez J.C. Allen P.G. Beggs A.H. Pollak M.R. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar). This suggests that the mechanism of disease in α-actinin-4-deficient mice may be different from that observed in mice (or humans) with deficiency of a slit-diaphragm component.

Thus, α-actinin-4 plays an essential and non-redundant role in podocyte function. In addition to cross-linking actin filaments, α-actinin-4 binds a number of adhesion molecules including β1-integrin and vinculin (16Otey C.A. Pavalko F.M. Burridge K. J.

Le T.C. Kos C.H. Henderson J.M. Allen P.G. Denker B.M. Pollak M.R. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: E167Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Both mice harboring a point mutation implicated in human ACTN4-mediated disease and Actn4-deficient mice develop similar renal disease phenotypes, including similar levels of proteinuria and podocyte foot process effacement (13Kos C.H. Le T.C. Sinha S. Henderson J.M. Kim S.H. Sugimoto H. Kalluri R. Gerszten R.E. Pollak M.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 1683-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 14Yao J. Le T.C. Kos C.H.

Thus, understanding the mechanism of the renal phenotype in α-actinin-4-deficient mice should provide insights into both the mechanism of ACTN4-mediated familial FSGS and the function of its gene product in podocytes. Recent reports have also shown that one mechanism for the development of glomerular disease is podocyte depletion in vivo, as demonstrated by loss of podocyte markers in sclerotic glomeruli as well as the presence of shed podocytes in the urine (20Kim Y.H.

Loss of podocytes is a feature not just of primary glomerular disease but may be an important component in the pathogenesis of common secondary diseases such as diabetic nephropathy (23Pagtalunan M.E. Miller P.L. Jumping-Eagle S. Nelson R.G. Myers B.D. Rennke H.G. Coplon N.S. Sun L. Meyer T.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 342-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar, 24Shirato I. Hishiki T.

Here we report that loss of α-actinin-4 leads to podocyte depletion. We used α-actinin-4-deficient mice both to characterize podocyte depletion in vivo as well as to generate α-actinin-4-deficient podocytes. We used these cultured podocytes as a cell system to understand the mechanism of podocyte depletion in α-actinin-4 deficiency. We demonstrate that α-actinin-4-deficient cells are less adherent than cells expressing α-actinin-4 and that this deficit can be rescued by transfecting α-actinin-4-deficient cells with α-actinin-4. We provide evidence that this altered adhesion is integrin-mediated by demonstrating that α-actinin-4 deficiency weakens the physical linkage of integrins to the cytoskeleton and alters the phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain of β1-integrin. Animals—Actn4-/- mice were developed as described previously (13Kos C.H. Le T.C. Sinha S. Henderson J.M. Kim S.H. Sugimoto H. Kalluri R. Gerszten R.E. Pollak M.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 1683-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Animal studies were performed in accordance with a protocol approved by the Harvard Medical Area Standing Committee on Animals. Cell Culture and Transfection—Podocytes were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Cellgro, Herndon, VA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma), and antibiotics/antimycotics (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY). To differentiate cells, cells were plated for 10-14 days at 37 °C. We used the FuGENE reagent (Roche Applied Science), and 1 μg of DNA to perform transient transfections of podocytes. Adhesion Assays—Plates (96 well) were coated with collagen I (10 μg/ml), collagen IV (10 μg/ml), laminin 10 and 11 (placental) (10 μg/ml), fibronectin (10 μg/ml), vitronectin (10 μg/ml), or laminin-1 (10 μg/ml) with 1% bovine serum albumin as the control. Podocytes were harvested with trypsin/EDTA and resuspended in serum-free medium. Cells were allowed to attach at 37 °C for 1 h. Unbound cells were removed by washing twice with phosphate-buffered saline. Attached cells were fixed in formalin, and cells in each well were counted. Two individuals recorded cell attachment for these experiments. Cell counts were obtained by averaging cell numbers from five wells. We normalized experiments to compare different repetitions of the assay on different days. Because of day-to-day variation in experimental setup, we normalized attachment assays by the average cell attachment/binding for that day. For adhesion studies under shear stress, we plated differentiated podocytes on collagen I, cultured the cells for a minimum of 6 days, and then used a Vera Varistaltic pump for flow rates of 1-9 ml/sec to produce a shear stress of 72-649 dyne/cm2. Observations were made using a cell chamber positioned under a Nikon Diaphot microscope equipped with a CCD camera using IPLab software for Macintosh. Podocyte Number in Glomeruli—3-4-μm renal sections from Actn4-/- and Actn4+/+ mice were fixed in acetone and co-stained for WT1 and DAPI. Co-localization of DAPI and WT1 signal was counted as detection of a podocyte. Two individuals made the experimental counts. The glomerulus was approximated to be a sphere, and a random sampling of 30 Actn4+/+ and 30 Actn4-/- glomeruli were analyzed for spherical size. Cross-sectional areas were calculated from the number of pixels per glomerulus per field to get an average pixel number per glomerulus. Based on the articles of Sanden et al. (27Sanden S.K. Wiggins J.E. Goyal M. Riggs L.K. Wiggins R.C. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2003; 14: 2484-2493Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and Weibel and Gomez (42Weibel E.R. Gomez D.M. J. Appl. Physiol. 1962; 17: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar) describing the counting of structures of sections and approximating the glomerulus to be a sphere, we used cross-sectional area as a measure in order to compare glomeruli size from Actn4+/+ and Actn4-/- mouse kidneys (27Sanden S.K. Wiggins J.E. Goyal M. Riggs L.K. Wiggins R.C. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2003; 14: 2484-2493Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Using ImageJ (ImageJ 1.33u Wayne Rasband, National Institutes of Health), the area of 30 Actn4-/- glomeruli and 30 Actn4+/+ glomeruli were analyzed to assess the relative area of glomeruli in Actn+/+ versus Actn4-/- mice. Area was calculated using ImageJ (pixel density): 18004.22 pixels ± 8365 for Actn4+/+ glomeruli versus 17116 ± 5909 pixels for Actn4-deficient glomeruli. These relative areas were not statistically different. As area was not significantly different between the Actn4+/+ and Actn4-/- mice, we estimated podocyte number per glomerulus by counting glomerular cells that were co-stained for WT1 and DAPI. Mice from both the 1 week and 6-10 week groups were subjected to statistical analysis by comparing all podocyte numbers/glomeruli for a minimum of 95 glomeruli counted per both the WT and Actn4-/- mice groups. Urinary Podocytes—To estimate both the total urine protein loaded on gels and the amount of proteinuria in Actn4-/- mice, we measured the albumin (mg/dl) and albumin/creatinine (mg/g) ratio of urine samples of Actn4-/- mice and controls using a Bayer DCA 2000+ machine. Expression of WT1 was assessed by Western blot of urine samples. Wild-type podocyte cell lysates were loaded as a positive control. Mouse monoclonal anti-WT1 antibody (sc-7385, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used to detect WT1. Immunoblotting—Cells were lysed in ice-cold 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0 buffer with 0.5% Triton X-100 buffer, with 2 mm EGTA, 4 mm EDTA, 30 mm sodium fluoride, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and a protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Complete, Roche Applied Science). Anti-α3-integrin antibody was provided by Dr. Jordan Kriedberg (Children's Hospital, Boston). Anti-β1-integrin antibody was from BD Biosciences (cat. no. 610467) (San Jose, CA). Phosphospecific anti-β1-integrin antibody (serine 785) was from BIOSOURCE (cat. no. 44-870, Camarillo, CA). This antibody specifically recognizes the serine 785 phosphorylation of β1-integrin and has been tested by the manufacturer using purified phosphopeptides to verify specificity (details are at the manufacturer's website). Anti-nephrin and anti-podocin antibodies were previously described (28Hamano Y. Grunkemeyer J.A. Sudhakar A. Zeisberg M. Cosgrove D. Morello R. Lee B. Sugimoto H. Kalluri R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31154-31162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Anti-synaptopodin antibody was provided by Dr. Peter Mundel (Albert Einstein Medical School). For the Kinexus signaling molecule screen, podocyte cell lysates were prepared using modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer as described above. FACS—To specifically assess cell surface expression of β1-integrin, we employed FACS with the antibody FITC-CD29 from BD Biosciences. We also used antibodies PE-α3-integrin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), PE-αV-integrin (BD Biosciences), and PE-β3-integrin (BD Biosciences). Geometric means of replicate samples were analyzed for statistical significance. A minimum of three replicates were analyzed for both WT and Actn4-/- podocyte cell lines. Apoptosis Assays—In vitro apoptosis assays measured histone-complexed DNA fragments: Cell Death Detection Plus ELISA (Roche Applied Science) at absorbance 405 nm following the manufacturer's protocol. Caspase 3 activation was measured by assessing cleavage of caspase 3 (caspase 3 antibody, Stressgen, Victoria, Canada) (29Samali A. Cai J. Zhivotovsky B. Jones D.P. Orrenius S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2040-2048Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). In vivo studies used the TUNEL assay to end-label DNA strand breaks: In situ Cell Death Detection kit, TMR Red (Roche Applied Science). Nuclear staining of kidney sections was also used to assess in vivo apoptosis by staining sections with DAPI. Apoptotic nuclei are detected as small, condensed, symmetrical spheres next to a nucleus; this technique has been used to analyze kidney glomerular apoptosis (30Kelly K.J. Plotkin Z. Vulgamott S.L.

Magnetic Bead-pulling— 4.5 μm Dynal (Invitrogen) magnetic beads were coated with RGD peptide (Integra LS, San Diego, CA). Podocytes were serum-starved in RPMI-alone medium for 24 h prior to experiments. RGD-coated beads were then applied to cells for 10-20 min and an electromagnet (350 pN force) was applied to beads for a 2-s pulse. Bead displacement was measured using IP Lab as described by Matthews et al. (34Matthews B.D. Overby D.R. Alenghat F.J. Karavitis J. Numaguchi Y. Allen P.G. Ingber D.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Comparisons were analyzed by the two-tailed Student's t test. p < 0.05 was considered significant. WT1, a Podocyte Marker, Detected in the Urine of Actn4-deficient Mice— Urinary podocytes have been reported in various human and rodent glomerulopathies (20Kim Y.H. Goyal M. Kurnit D. Wharram B.

We looked for urinary podocyte markers as an indicator of podocyte detachment in vivo in Actn4-/- mice. WT1 is a transcription factor implicated in glomerular disease that specifically localizes to glomerular podocytes (36Mundlos S. Pelletier J. Darveau A. Bachmann M. Winterpacht A. Zabel B.

Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 2379-2394Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We detected WT1 protein in the urine of Actn4-/- mice but not in urine from wild-type littermates. Fig. 1A shows a representative Western blot performed using mouse urinary protein. To detect WT1 expression by Western blot, we used a mouse monoclonal antibody previously shown to be specific for podocytes of mature kidneys (21Petermann A.T. Pippin J. Krofft R. Blonski M. Griffin S. Durvasula R. Shankland S.J. Nephron Exp. Nephrol. 2004; 98: e114-e123Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 27Sanden S.K. Wiggins J.E. Goyal M. Riggs L.K. Wiggins R.C. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2003; 14: 2484-2493Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We have detected urinary podocytes from Actn4-/- mice as early as 8 days of age. We have only observed urinary WT1 in Actn4-/- mice (80%) but never in Actn4-expressing mice. In the early age mice group (1 week), we detected urinary WT1 in 75% of Actn4-/- mice and in the late age mice cohort (6-10-week-old), we detected urinary WT1 in 83% of mice. We also detected the presence of podocin, another podocyte-specific marker, in a subset of urine samples collected from Actn4-/- mice (data not shown). We previously reported that Actn4-/- mice have progressive proteinuria (13Kos C.H. Le T.C. Sinha S. Henderson J.M. Kim S.H. Sugimoto H. Kalluri R. Gerszten R.E. Pollak M.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 1683-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). We assayed urine for protein and compared the age of onset of proteinuria with the age of onset of podocyturia. Fig. 1B summarizes the proteinuria (albuminuria) in Actn4-/- mice as compared with controls and Fig. 1C summarizes the albumin/creatinine ratio. Both albuminuria and albumin/creatinine ratio are used as clinical parameters in determining the extent of urine protein concentration in patient's urine. Again, only Actn4-/- mice had proteinuria as compared with WT control littermates at both age groups (p < 0.002) (Fig. 1, B and C). Moreover, all Actn4-/- mice exhibiting podocyturia showed some degree of proteinuria and vice versa. Thus, podocyturia and proteinuria appear to develop concurrently. None of the wild-type control littermates exhibited detectable proteinuria (Fig. 1, B and C). Podocyte Number per Glomerulus Is Decreased in Actn4-deficient Mice—To correlate urine podocytes with podocyte detachment in vivo, we compared relative podocyte number per glomerulus of Actn4-/- mice versus Actn4+/+ mice. There have been numerous reports detailing methods to estimate podocyte number and podocyte loss (5Wiggins J.E. Goyal M. Sanden S.K. Wharram B.L. Shedden K.A. Misek D.E. Kuick R.D. Wiggins R.C. J.

It is difficult to determine an exact number of podocytes per glomerulus given the complex capillary loop structure on which the podocytes reside. Most techniques rely on using many cross-sections from a given kidney. To obtain a relative measurement of podocytes per glomerulus for comparisons, we used WT1 staining as a marker of podocytes in 3-4-micron thick kidney sections. WT1 has been used before for counting podocytes by approximating the renal glomerulus to be a sphere and assessing volume using equations derived by Weibel and Gomez (22Wharram B.L. Goyal M. Wiggins J.E. Sanden S.K. Hussain S. Filipiak W.E. Saunders T.L. Dysko R.C. Kohno K. Holzman L.B. Wiggins R.C. J. Am. Soc.

Kidney sections were also co-stained for DAPI. Two different investigators used colocalization of WT1 and DAPI to identify podocytes (Fig. 2A). We found a 9.9% (p = 0.02) decrease in podocytes per glomerulus in day 8 Actn4-/- mice compared with day 8 Actn4+/+ mice (Fig. 2B). At 6-10 weeks of age, similar assays revealed an increase in the difference in podocyte number per glomerulus (18.8%, p = 0.008) (Fig. 2B). The 10-20% podocyte loss in podocyte number/glomeruli of young Actn4-/- mice, while not large in absolute magnitude of the change, is similar to what has been observed in other related models. Wharram et al. (22Wharram B.L. Goyal M. Wiggins J.E. Sanden S.K. Hussain S. Filipiak W.E. Saunders T.L. Dysko R.C. Kohno K. Holzman L.B. Wiggins R.C. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2005; 16: 2941-2952Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar) recently described the direct effect of podocyte loss in rat kidneys. They were able to control podocyte loss because rats were engineered to express the diphtheria toxin receptor only on podocytes, rendering these cells susceptible to the toxin. 0-20% podocyte loss caused clear glomerular changes including proteinuria and mesangial cell expansion (22Wharram B.L. Goyal M. Wiggins J.E. Sanden S.K. Hussain S. Filipiak W.E. Saunders T.L. Dysko R.C. Kohno K. Holzman L.B. Wiggins R.C. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2005; 16: 2941-2952Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). 21-40% podocyte loss in this model leads to focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and >40% leads to global glomerulosclerosis (22Wharram B.L.

While we believe the trend toward podocyte loss in Actn4-/- mice would increase with age, we limited our analysis of glomeruli studied to prior to onset of major glomerulosclerosis because significant scarring of glomeruli and altered podocyte morphology makes interpretation of the presence or absence of podocytes unreliable. Other groups have also found small but reproducible podocyte losses in other animal models of glomerular disease. For example, Petermann"
https://openalex.org/W2022031590,"Collagen-related peptide is a selective agonist for the platelet collagen receptor Glycoprotein VI. The triple helical peptide contains ten GPO triplets/strand (single letter amino acid nomenclature, where O is hydroxyproline) and so over-represents GPO compared with native collagen sequence. To investigate the ability of Glycoprotein VI to recognize GPO triplets in a setting more representative of the collagens, we synthesized a set of triple helical peptides containing fewer GPO triplets, varying their number and spacing within an inert (GPP)n backbone. The adhesion of recombinant human Glycoprotein VI ectodo-main, like that of human platelets, to these peptides increased with their GPO content, and platelet adhesion was abolished by the specific anti-Glycoprotein VI-blocking antibody, 10B12. Platelet aggregation and protein tyrosine phosphorylation were induced only by cross-linked peptides and only those that contained two or more GPO triplets. Such peptides were less potent than cross-linked collagen-related peptide. Our data suggest that both the sequences GPOGPO and GPO.........GPO represent functional Glycoprotein VI recognition motifs within collagen. Furthermore, we propose that the (GPO)4 motif can support simultaneous binding of two glycoprotein VI molecules, in either a parallel or anti-parallel stacking arrangement, which could play an important role in activation of signaling."

Phosphorylation was mediated by glycogen synthase kinase 3 and cyclin-dependent kinase 5 protein kinases, while calcineurin was responsible for dephosphorylation. Following the transient phosphorylation of APP, intraneuronal Aβ accumulated and induced neurotoxicity. Phosphorylation of APP on Thr-668 was indispensable for intraneuronal accumulation of Aβ.

Intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles are made of paired helical filaments containing the hyperphosphorylated microtubule-associated protein tau (2Brion J.P. Couck A.M. Passareiro E. Flament-Durand J. J. Submicrosc. Cytol. 1985; 17: 89-96PubMed Google Scholar). The amyloid core of extracellular senile plaques contains fibrils of amyloid β peptide (Aβ) (3Glenner G.G. Wong C.W.

The most compelling evidence that Aβ is the causative agent of AD comes from observations on genetic mutations that cause familial forms of AD. Mutations of APP or presenilin genes alter the processing of APP (6Selkoe D.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5196) Google Scholar), giving rise to increased production of Aβ, in particular of Aβ containing 42 amino acids (Aβ1–42), which is more prone to aggregation (7Snyder S.W.

These genetic data founded the amyloid cascade hypothesis (8Hardy J.A. Higgins G.A. Science. 1992; 256: 184-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (5201) Google Scholar) that implies that plaques should develop before tangles. However, neuropathological studies have indicated that the initial development of tangles precedes the development of amyloid plaques by at least two decades (9Schonheit B. Zarski R. Ohm T.G. Neurobiol. Aging. 2004; 25: 697-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). To reconcile these controversial observations, it has been proposed that the initial neurofibrillary changes are independent of Aβ (10Price J.L. Morris J.C. Ann. Neurol. 1999; 45: 358-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1387) Google Scholar), while this process is accelerated by the presence of Aβ, which can stimulate AD-like phosphorylation of tau in neuronal cultures (11Takashima A. Noguchi K. Sato K. Hoshino T. Imahori K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7789-7793Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). For many years, the amyloid cascade hypothesis maintained that memory failure in AD derived from neuronal death induced by insoluble extracellular deposits of amyloid fibrils. Newer findings, however, demonstrate that accumulation of intraneuronal Aβ is neurotoxic (12Kienlen-Campard P. Miolet S. Tasiaux B. Octave J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15666-15670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 13Pierrot N. Ghisdal P. Caumont A.S. Octave J.N. J. Neurochem. 2004; 88: 1140-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). A common alteration of the neuronal metabolism of APP and tau, leading to the production of both hyperphosphorylated tau and Aβ, remains elusive. Here we show that in cultured neurons membrane depolarization induced a calcium-mediated transient phosphorylation of APP and tau by the Cdk5 and GSK3 protein kinases, followed by a dephosphorylation of both proteins. Following transient phosphorylation of APP, intraneuronal Aβ1–42 accumulated and induced important neurotoxicity. This intraneuronal accumulation of Aβ1–42 was not observed following expression of the APPT668A mutant, indicating that phosphorylation of APP on Thr-668 was indispensable. Thus, an increase of neuronal cytosolic calcium concentration may lead to both neuronal AD-like phosphorylation of tau and intraneuronal accumulation of Aβ, which induces neuronal death in AD. Neuronal Culture—Primary cultures of cortical neurons were prepared from embryonic day 17 rat brains as described (14Macq A.F. Czech C. Essalmani R. Brion J.P. Maron A. Mercken L. Pradier L. Octave J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28931-28936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). All cell culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. Cortices were dissected and incubated in Hanks' Buffered Salt Solution medium (1 mm sodium pyruvate, 10 mm HEPES without Ca2+ and Mg2+), dissociated in the same medium containing 1.26 mm Ca2+, 0.50 mm MgCl2, and 0.41 mm MgSO4. Cells were plated in 6-, 12-, or 96-well culture dishes (4 × 105 cells/cm2), pretreated with 10 μg/ml poly l-lysine, and cultured for 6 days in vitro in Neurobasal™ medium + B-27 supplement and 0.5 mm l-glutamine prior to infection with recombinant adenoviruses. Under these conditions, neuronal cultures (up to 98% neurons) display high differentiation and survival rates (15Brewer G.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 42: 674-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Viral Infections—The construction and purification of recombinant adenovirus encoding wild-type human APP695 (AdRSVAPP) was performed as described previously (16Lemarchand P. Jaffe H.A. Danel C. Cid M.C. Kleinman H.K. Stratford-Perricaudet L.D. Perricaudet M. Pavirani A. Lecocq J.P. Crystal R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6482-6486Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Thr-668 of wild-type human APP695 was mutated to alanine (APPT668A) by PCR, and the mutation was confirmed by sequencing. AdRSVAPPTA was constructed and purified using the AdEasy™ XL adenoviral vector system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). After 6 days in vitro, neurons were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 100 for 4 h in a minimal volume of culture medium. The infection medium was then replaced by fresh culture medium for 4 days. Under these conditions, at least 75% of neurons express the proteins encoded by recombinant adenoviruses (14Macq A.F. Czech C. Essalmani R. Brion J.P. Maron A. Mercken L. Pradier L. Octave J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28931-28936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Neuronal Treatments—Four days after infection, cells were depolarized in neuronal culture medium containing 35 mm KCl (final concentration) for increasing periods of time up to 8 h. In some experiments, neurons were depolarized during 10 min before reincubation for different times up to 7 h in a culture medium without KCl. Depolarization did not induce any modification of APP or tau expression. In some experiments, neurons were pretreated for 1 h with 25 μm SB415286, an ATP-competitive inhibitor of GSK3 kindly provided by A. Goffinet (Université Catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium), with 10 μm roscovitine (Calbiochem) for 1 h, with 1 μm nimodipine (Bayer, Leverkusen, Germany) for 10 min, with 4 mm EGTA (Merck) for 2 h or with 250 nm N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenylacetyl-l-alanyl)]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT), a functional inhibitor of γ-secretase kindly provided by L. Mercken (Sanofi-Aventis, France) for 2 h, with 10 μm calmidazolium (Calbiochem) for 1 h, with 10 μm cyclosporine A (Calbiochem) for 1 h before a further depolarization in the presence of these components. All these treatments did not affect APP or tau expression or neuronal survival. Protein Analysis and Densitometric Quantification—Cell lysates (10 μg protein) were analyzed by Western blotting as previously described (14Macq A.F. Czech C. Essalmani R. Brion J.P. Maron A. Mercken L. Pradier L. Octave J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28931-28936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Proteins were incubated in sample buffer (125 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 4% SDS, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, 1% bromphenol blue) for 5 min at 96 °C, loaded onto 7.5% acrylamide gels or 4–12% Nupage™ bis-Tris gel electrophoresis (Invitrogen), and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the following primary antibodies: WO-2 (1:2,000), a mouse monoclonal antibody that recognizes amino acids 5–8 of human Aβ sequence (Genetics Co., Zurich, Switzerland); anti-PT668 (1:2,000), an anti-phospho-APP Thr-668 antibody (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA); anti-β-actin (1: 2,000), a rabbit polyclonal serum (Sigma); B19 (1:10,000), a rabbit polyclonal serum that recognizes tau in a phosphorylation-independent manner (17Brion J.P. Hanger D.P. Bruce M.T. Couck A.M. Flament-Durand J. Anderton B.H. Biochem. J. 1991; 273: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar); PHF1 (1:5,000), a mouse monoclonal antibody recognizing tau phosphorylated at Ser-396/404 (18Otvos Jr., L. Feiner L. Lang E. Szendrei G.I. Goedert M. Lee V.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 39: 669-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar); anti-Cter (1: 2,000), a rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against the 17 C-terminal residues of human APP (19Sergeant N. David J.P. Champain D. Ghestem A. Wattez A. Delacourte A. J. Neurochem. 2002; 81: 663-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar); TPK1 (1:1000), a mouse monoclonal antibody raised against GSK3β (Transduction Laboratories, Greenland, NH); 44–604G (1:10,000), a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against phospho-Tyr-216 of GSK3β (BIOSOURCE Europe, Nivelles, Belgium); C-19 (1:8000), a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the C terminus of p35 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Blots were revealed with secondary antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase, and immunoreactive bands were detected by the ECL system (Amersham). For quantification of APP and tau phosphorylations (P-APP and P-tau detected with the anti-PT668 and PHF1 antibodies, respectively), membranes were stripped and reincubated with anti-Cter or B19 antibodies. The ratio between immunoreactive bands, detected in each experimental condition, was quantified with an electrophoresis gel imaging system (Bio-Rad Gel Doc 2000) coupled to Quantity One™ software. Immunoprecipitation of APP—Neurons (4 × 106 cells plated in each well of a 6-well plate) were scraped and pelleted in cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were solubilized in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (RIPA 1 × 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) containing protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and phosphatase inhibitors (vanadate 1 mm, nafamostat mesylate 20 mm, EGTA 1 mm, β-glycerophosphate pentahydrate 5 mm, and sodium pyrophosphate 5 mm) purchased from Roche Applied Science. The samples were immunoprecipitated with 1.5 μg of WO-2 antibody (described above) overnight at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose (5 mg/ml; Amersham Biosciences) was then added for 4 h. The samples were centrifuged at 15,800 × g for 2 min at 4 °C, and the pellets were washed twice with RIPA 1 × and once with Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5). Pellets were incubated for 5 min at 96 °C in sample buffer (see above). The samples were then centrifuged at 15,800 × g for 2 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were analyzed by Western blotting on a 4–12% Nupage™ gel using the WO-2 or anti-PT668 antibodies as described previously. Extraction and Quantification of Aβ—Aβ was extracted from cell lysates as described previously (20Skovronsky D.M. Doms R.W. Lee V.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1031-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Neurons (12 × 106 cells) plated in three wells of a 6-well plate were solubilized in 150 μl of formic acid (70%), cleared by centrifugation (55,000 × g, 4 °C, 20 min), and supernatant fluids were vacuum dried. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of alkaline carbonate buffer (2% Na2CO3, 0.1 N NaOH) and centrifuged (15,800 × g, 2 min, 4 °C). Protein concentration was measured on 50 μl of the resulting supernatant fluid, called protein solution, using the BCA protein assay (Pierce). For intracellular Aβ quantification, 100 μl of the remaining protein solution was neutralized and diluted 1:3 in H2O containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 0.5% Triton X-100 (v/v), and 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 (final concentration). For extracellular Aβ quantification, 100 μl of culture medium, collected after neuronal treatments, was treated with protease inhibitors (see above) and cleared by centrifugation (15,800 × g, 5 min, 4 °C). The quantification of Aβ 1–40 and Aβ 1–42 isoforms was performed by fluorescent sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) according to the manufacturer's instructions (BIOSOURCE). Standard curves of synthetic Aβ 1–40 and Aβ 1–42 were performed in the same medium as the samples. Control experiments demonstrated that there is no cross-reaction between Aβ 1–40 and Aβ 1–42 detection. Fluorescence emission was measured on an HTS 7000 Plus plate reader (PerkinElmer) at excitation/emission wavelengths of 485/535 nm, respectively. Aβ 1–42 intracellular concentrations were expressed as pg/mg of cellular protein. Survival Assays—Cell survival was measured by the colorimetric 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltretrazolium bromide assay. Neurons cultured in 96-well culture dishes were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in the presence of 0.5 mg/ml 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (Sigma). Medium was removed, and dark blue crystals that had formed were dissolved by adding 100 μl/well of lysis solution (isopropyl alcohol/0.04 N HCl). Absorbance at 492 nm was measured using a microplate reader (PerkinElmer). Statistical Analysis and Presentation of the Results—The number of samples (n) in each experimental condition is indicated in the figure legends. Statistical analysis was performed by one-way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni's multiple comparison post-test. Differences were considered as significant when p <0.05 (**, p <0.01; ***, p <0.001). Each Western blot presented in the figures is representative of at least three independent experiments. Neuronal Depolarization Affects Tau Phosphorylation—Accumulation of phosphorylated microtubule-associated protein tau in affected neurons in AD has been attributed to increased kinase or decreased phosphatase activity (21Gong C.X. Singh T.J. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 921-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 22Imahori K. Uchida T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 121: 179-188PubMed Google Scholar). Many neuronal protein kinase and phosphatase activities are calcium dependent, and an increase in cytosolic calcium concentration triggers the hyperphosphorylation of tau protein (23Hartigan J.A. Johnson G.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21395-21401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). We investigated whether tau phosphorylation would be affected by neuronal depolarization. Primary cultures of rat cortical neurons were incubated in the presence of 35 mm KCl, and the phosphorylation of tau was measured by increased immunoreactivity toward the PHF1 antibody directed against phosphotau Ser-396/404 (18Otvos Jr., L. Feiner L. Lang E. Szendrei G.I. Goedert M. Lee V.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 39: 669-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Although depolarization did not affect tau expression, a small mobility shift of tau was observed together with an increase in tau phosphorylation after 30 min of depolarization (Fig. 1A). In depolarizing conditions, activation of GSK3β was demonstrated using a phospho-specific antibody recognizing active GSK3β phosphorylated on Tyr-216 (Fig. 1, B and C). In the same experimental conditions, activation of Cdk5 was demonstrated by the processing of p35 to p25 (Fig. 1D). In a kinetic study conducted for up to 8 h, an increase in tau phosphorylation was followed by a dephosphorylation corresponding to a decrease in tau phosphorylation below its initial state (Fig. 1, E and F). A non-toxic concentration of SB415285 completely inhibited GSK3β-mediated phosphorylation of tau but did not affect dephosphorylation of the protein (Fig. 1, E and F). Neuronal Depolarization Affects APP Phosphorylation—Phosphorylation of APP affects the production of Aβ (24Phiel C.J. Wilson C.A. Lee V.M. Klein P.S. Nature. 2003; 423: 435-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar, 25Ryder J. Su Y. Liu F. Li B. Zhou Y. Ni B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 312: 922-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The Thr-668 of APP695 can be phosphorylated by Cdk5 and GSK3 protein kinases (26Aplin A.E. Gibb G.M. Jacobsen J.S. Gallo J.M. Anderton B.H. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 699-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 27Liu F. Su Y. Li B. Zhou Y. Ryder J. Gonzalez-DeWhitt P. May P.C. Ni B. FEBS Lett. 2003; 547: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), which are activated in depolarizing conditions (Fig. 1, B–D) and can be modulated by calcium (23Hartigan J.A. Johnson G.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21395-21401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 28Kerokoski P. Suuronen T. Salminen A. Soininen H. Pirttila T. Neurosci. Lett. 2004; 368: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether neuronal depolarization could modify the phosphorylation of APP695 on Thr-668. Following adenoviral expression of human APP695, rat cultured neurons were incubated for different times in the presence of 35 mm KCl, and the phosphorylation of both transfected and endogenous APP was measured using an anti-phospho-APP Thr-668 antibody. Depolarization did not affect APP expression but induced a transient phosphorylation of APP, followed by a dephosphorylation of the protein (Fig. 2, A and B), with kinetics similar to that observed for the phosphorylation of tau (Fig. 1, E and F). This effect on APP phosphorylation was calcium dependent, because no modification of APP phosphorylation was observed when neurons were depolarized in a culture medium without calcium (Fig. 2, A and B). Roscovitine, an inhibitor of Cdk5 (29Meijer L. Borgne A. Mulner O. Chong J.P. Blow J.J. Inagaki N. Inagaki M. Delcros J.G. Moulinoux J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 527-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar), or SB415286, an inhibitor of GSK3 (30Coghlan M.P. Culbert A.A. Cross D.A. Corcoran S.L. Yates J.W. Pearce N.J. Rausch O.L. Murphy G.J. Carter P.S. Roxbee C.L. Mills D. Brown M.J. Haigh D. Ward R.W. Smith D.G. Murray K.J. Reith A.D. Holder J.C. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: 793-803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar), partly inhibited the phosphorylation of APP. Co-treatment of neurons with non-toxic concentrations of both inhibitors completely inhibited the phosphorylation of APP but did not affect the dephosphorylation of the protein (Fig. 2, A and B). Because depolarization induced a rapid phosphorylation of APP, we investigated whether a short preincubation of neurons in the presence of 35 mm KCl followed by their reincubation for different times without KCl (Fig. 3A) was sufficient to induce APP phosphorylation. In these experimental conditions, an increase in APP phosphorylation was measured during the first 2 h of reincubation. A longer reincubation did not induce APP dephosphorylation below its initial phosphorylation state (Fig. 3, B and C), indicating that dephosphorylation of APP only occurred when neurons were maintained in 35 mm KCl for longer periods of time.FIGURE 3A short neuronal depolarization induces transient phosphorylation of APP without dephosphorylation of the protein. A, rat cortical neurons expressing human APP695 were depolarized with 35 mm KCl during 10 min and reincubated for increasing periods of time, up to 7 h, in a culture medium without KCl. B, the expression of APP or phospho-APP (P-APP) in cell extracts was analyzed by Western blotting using the anti-Cter (upper panel) or the anti-PT668 (lower panel) antibody. C, the P-APP/APP signal ratio, detected in each experimental condition, was quantified and expressed (mean ± S.E.) as relative values; n = 4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Dephosphorylation of APP was inhibited by calmidazolium, indicating the contribution of a calmodulin-dependent phosphatase activity (Fig. 4, A and B). Calcineurin is a calcium/calmodulin neuronal phosphatase that is inhibited by cyclosporine A. Dephosphorylation of APP was indeed inhibited by cyclosporine A, which did not modify phosphorylation of the protein (Fig. 4, A and B). Cyclosporin A also inhibited dephosphorylation of tau by maintaining tau phosphorylation for a longer period of time (Fig. 4, C and D). Transient Phosphorylation of APP Induces Intraneuronal Accumulation of Aβ—Following adenoviral expression of human APP695 in rat cultured neurons, the production of human Aβ was measured by ELISA. Intraneuronal Aβ 1–42, but not Aβ 1–40, was detected after 2 h of depolarization and progressively accumulated in neurons up to 8 h (Fig. 5A). The amount of extracellular Aβ1–40 was not affected by depolarization (13Pierrot N. Ghisdal P. Caumont A.S. Octave J.N. J. Neurochem. 2004; 88: 1140-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Because intraneuronal Aβ 1–42 accumulated during the dephosphorylation period of APP, we investigated whether phosphorylation or dephosphorylation of APP was responsible for Aβ production. Nimodipine, a specific antagonist of L voltage-sensitive calcium channels (31Collins F. Lile J.D. Brain Res. 1989; 502: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), completely inhibited the phosphorylation of APP but did not affect the dephosphorylation of the protein (Fig. 5, B and C). When neurons were depolarized in the presence of nimodipine, intraneuronal Aβ was not detectable by ELISA (not shown), indicating that phosphorylation of APP rather than its dephosphorylation was needed for intraneuronal Aβ production. In the presence of roscovitine, the initial increase in APP phosphorylation was still observed (Fig. 2, A and B) and was sufficient to produce intraneuronal Aβ, because roscovitine did not significantly decrease the amount of intraneuronal Aβ recovered after an 8-h depolarization (not shown). Phosphorylation of APP on Thr-668 Is Indispensable for the Neurotoxic Accumulation of Intraneuronal Aβ—To confirm that phosphorylation of APP695 on Thr-668 is needed for intraneuronal Aβ accumulation, a human APPT668A mutant was expressed in rat cultured neurons using recombinant adenoviruses. Similar levels of APP and APPT668A were detected by immunoblotting using the WO-2 antibody, which specifically detects human APP (Fig. 6A). Following immunoprecipitation with the WO-2 antibody, the anti-phospho-APP Thr-668 antibody detected human APP, but not human APPT668A (Fig. 6B). When neurons expressing human APPT668A were depolarized in the presence of 35 mm KCl, intraneuronal Aβ was not detected by ELISA (Fig. 6C), confirming that the phosphorylation of APP on Thr-668 was indispensable for intraneuronal Aβ 1–42 accumulation. The neurotoxicity induced by intraneuronal accumulation of Aβ 1–42 (12Kienlen-Campard P. Miolet S. Tasiaux B. Octave J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15666-15670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 32Zhang Y. McLaughlin R. Goodyer C. LeBlanc A. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) is prevented by inhibition of Aβ production in depolarized neurons (13Pierrot N. Ghisdal P. Caumont A.S. Octave J.N. J. Neurochem. 2004; 88: 1140-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Because APPT668A did not produce any intraneuronal Aβ, we investigated whether differences in toxicity could be observed following depolarization of neurons expressing either human APP or human APPT668A. In control neurons, >80% of cell survival was measured following a 72-h depolarization (Fig. 6D). On the contrary, in neurons expressing APP only 60% of cell survival was measured, and a significant recovery was observed in the presence of 250 nm DAPT, a functional inhibitor of γ-secretase (Fig. 6D). In neurons expressing APPT668A, no toxicity related to Aβ production was observed (Fig. 6D). In 1985, the major constituents of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, which coexist in AD, were identified as Aβ and tau, respectively (2Brion J.P. Couck A.M. Passareiro E. Flament-Durand J. J. Submicrosc. Cytol. 1985; 17: 89-96PubMed Google Scholar, 4Masters C.L. Simms G. Weinman N.A. Multhaup G. McDonald B.L. Beyreuther K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4245-4249Crossref PubMed Scopus (3683) Google Scholar). Since then, investigators studying the metabolism of tau have provided strong evidence that hyperphosphorylated protein tau plays a key role in the development of AD. In addition, neurofibrillary tangles precede the formation of senile plaques (9Schonheit B. Zarski R. Ohm T.G. Neurobiol. Aging. 2004; 25: 697-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 33Bennett D.A. Schneider J.A. Wilson R.S. Bienias J.L. Arnold S.E. Arch. Neurol. 2004; 61: 378-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Otherwise, strong evidence that Aβ is the causative agent of AD was provided by the study of familial cases in which gene mutations give rise to an increased production of Aβ (6Selkoe D.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5196) Google Scholar). The challenge is to identify common cellular mechanisms that could account for the formation of both typical AD lesions. Transgenic mice expressing human APP and presenilin gene mutations show amyloid deposits in their brain but do not display any neurofibrillary tangles (34Boutajangout A. Authelet M. Blanchard V. Touchet N. Tremp G. Pradier L. Brion J.P. Neurobiol. Dis. 2004; 15: 47-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). These latter lesions are found in the brain of transgenic mice carrying mutations of the human tau gene (11Takashima A. Noguchi K. Sato K. Hoshino T. Imahori K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7789-7793Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). The only way to reproduce both typical AD lesions in vivo is to create transgenic animals expressing human APP, presenilin, and tau gene mutations (35Oddo S. Caccamo A. Kitazawa M. Tseng B.P. LaFerla F.M. Neurobiol. Aging. 2003; 24: 1063-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar), a situation that never occurs in AD. In cultured cells, extracellular Aβ neurotoxicity requires fibril formation (36Walsh D.M. Hartley D.M. Kusumoto Y. Fezoui Y. Condron M.M. Lomakin A. Benedek G.B. Selkoe D.J. Teplow D.B. J. Biol.

Aimoto S. Constantinescu S.N. Octave J.N. Smith S.O. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 5503-5516Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Such neurotoxicity could be related to tau phosphorylation, because extracellular Aβ fibrils stimulate AD-like phosphorylation of tau (11Takashima A. Noguchi K. Sato K. Hoshino T. Imahori K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7789-7793Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). In contrast, extracellular monomeric Aβ is not neurotoxic (12Kienlen-Campard P. Miolet S. Tasiaux B. Octave J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15666-15670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 39Zou K. Gong J.S. Yanagisawa K. Michikawa M. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4833-4841Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In cultured neurons constitutively producing Aβ, neurotoxicity is only observed when intraneuronal Aβ accumulates (12Kienlen-Campard P.

Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). In transgenic mice as well as in AD patients, intraneuronal accumulation of Aβ precedes the formation of extracellular amyloid deposits (40Walsh D.M. Tseng B.P. Rydel R.E. Podlisny M.B. Selkoe D.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10831-10839Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar) and a structural organization of intraneuronal Aβ as small soluble oligomers induces important neurotoxicity (41Klein W.L. Krafft G.A. Finch C.E. Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24: 219-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). Here, we identified a common cellular mechanism leading to transient phosphorylation of both tau and APP followed by intraneuronal accumulation of Aβ. Following depolarization, an increase in cytosolic calcium concentration can activate several signaling pathways and different protein kinases and phosphatases. Consequently, phosphorylation of APP and tau was observed, followed by dephosphorylation of the proteins. Transient phosphorylations of tau and APP showed similar kinetics, indicating that phosphorylation of one protein is not needed for the subsequent phosphorylation of the other one. The use of phospho-specific antibodies recognizing active GSK3β and the analysis of the processing of p35 to p25 demonstrated the activation of GSK3β and Cdk5 in depolarizing conditions. The use of inhibitors identified Cdk5 and GSK3 as protein kinases involved in phosphorylation of APP on Thr-668, confirming previous observations indicating that Thr-668 of APP is indeed a substrate of these protein kinases (26Aplin A.E. Gibb G.M. Jacobsen J.S. Gallo J.M. Anderton B.H. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 699-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 42Iijima K. Ando K. Takeda S. Satoh Y. Seki T. Itohara S. Greengard P. Kirino Y. Nairn A.C. Suzuki T. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1085-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Cdk5 and GSK3β are also involved in AD-like phosphorylation of tau (43Ahlijanian M.K. Barrezueta N.X. Williams R.D. Jakowski A. Kowsz K.P. McCarthy S. Coskran T. Carlo A. Seymour P.A. Burkhardt J.E. Nelson R.B. McNeish J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Lett. 1992; 147: 58-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Following neuronal depolarization, a transient phosphorylation of tau was demonstrated by an increased immunoreactivity toward the PHF1 antibody. Concomitantly, a mobility shift of the protein was observed, although rather small because tau from primary cultures of embryonic neurons is highly phosphorylated. A transient increase in intracellular calcium concentration was previously demonstrated to induce a GSK3β-mediated phosphorylation of tau (23Hartigan J.A. Johnson G.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21395-21401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), and a biphasic effect of calcium influx on tau phosphorylation was also observed (45Shea T.B. Ekinci F.J. J. Alzheimer's Dis. 1999; 1: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Although we have no evidence that tau phosphorylation is associated with intraneuronal Aβ accumulation, the transient phosphorylation of APP on Thr-668 was indispensable to induce the accumulation of intraneuronal Aβ1–42. Inhibition of phosphorylation of APP on Thr-668 was previously demonstrated to influence the amyloidogenic catabolic pathway of APP (24Phiel C.J. Wilson C.A. Lee V.M. Klein P.S. Nature. 2003; 423: 435-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar, 25Ryder J. Su Y. Liu F. Li B. Zhou Y. Ni B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 312: 922-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Cdk5 and its regulatory subunit p35 play a key role in the development of the mammalian central nervous system (46Paglini G. Caceres A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1528-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). A calcium-dependent proteolytic cleavage of p35 generates p25, leading to aberrant Cdk5 activation (47Lee M.S. Kwon Y.T. Li M. Peng J. Friedlander R.M. Tsai L.H. Nature. 2000; 405: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar, 48Lew J. Huang Q.Q. Qi Z. Winkfein R.J. Aebersold R. Hunt T. Wang J.H. Nature. 1994; 371: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). In transgenic mice overexpressing p25 in the postnatal forebrain, endogenous tau was hyperphosphorylated and neurofibrillary tangles developed in the brain (49Cruz J.C. Tseng H.C. Goldman J.A. Shih H. Tsai L.H. Neuron. 2003; 40: 471-483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). The absence of amyloid deposits in these animals could result from the absence of human APP expression, because amyloid deposits were found only in transgenic animals expressing mutated human APP (50Calhoun M.E. Wiederhold K.H. Abramowski D. Phinney A.L. Probst A. Sturchler-Pierrat C. Staufenbiel M. Sommer B. Jucker M. Nature. 1998; 395: 755-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 51Games D. Adams D.

Nature. 1995; 373: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (2251) Google Scholar). Because a modification in intraneuronal calcium concentrations can induce both phosphorylation of tau and the intraneuronal accumulation of Aβ, neuronal calcium homeostasis has to be precisely regulated. Presenilins were recently demonstrated to form endoplasmic reticulum calcium leak channels, a function disrupted by familial AD-linked mutations (52Tu H. Nelson O. Bezprozvanny A. Wang Z. Lee S.F. Hao Y.H. Serneels L. De Strooper B. Yu G. Bezprozvanny I. Cell. 2006; 126: 981-993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). This calcium-signaling function for presenilins provides support for the calcium hypothesis of AD linked to presenilin mutations. In sporadic AD, alterations in cellular calcium homeostasis are associated with neurodegenerative processes (53Mattson M.P. Chan S.L. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 205-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 54Mattson M.P. LaFerla F.M. Chan S.L. Leissring M.A. Shepel P.N. Geiger J.D. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 222-229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). A major protein involved in the control of neuronal calcium homeostasis is the N-methyl-d-aspartate ionotropic glutamate receptor. A decreased glutamate uptake increases extracellular glutamate levels in aging and in AD fibroblasts (55Zoia C.P. Tagliabue E. Isella V. Begni B. Fumagalli L. Brighina L. Appollonio I. Racchi M. Ferrarese C. Neurobiol. Aging. 2005; 26: 825-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and an excessive stimulation of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor triggers neurotoxic intracellular calcium accumulation. Memantine, a non-competitive antagonist of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor, is the only anti-glutamatergic drug currently approved for the treatment of moderate to severe AD (56Koch H.J. Uyanik G.

Brain Res. 2002; 958: 210-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The search for molecules able to control calcium homeostasis as potential drugs is actively underway and might prove to be effective in AD in view of the present results. We thank A.

https://openalex.org/W2083838481,"Vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) is an actin regulatory protein that links signaling pathways to remodeling of the cytoskeleton. VASP functions are modulated by protein kinases, which phosphorylate the sites Ser-157, Ser-239, and Thr-278. The kinase responsible for Thr-278 phosphorylation, biological functions of the phosphorylation, and association with disease states have remained enigmatic. Using VASP phosphorylation status-specific antibodies, we identified AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a serine-threonine kinase and fundamental sensor of energy homeostasis, in a screen for kinases that phosphorylate the Thr-278 site of VASP in endothelial cells. Pharmacological AMPK inhibitors and activators and AMPK mutants revealed that the kinase specifically targets residue Thr-278 but not Ser-157 or Ser-239. Quantitative fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis and serum response factor transcriptional reporter assays, which quantify the cellular F-/G-actin equilibrium, indicated that AMPK-mediated VASP phosphorylation impaired actin stress fiber formation and altered cell morphology. In the Zucker Diabetic Fatty (ZDF) rat model for type II diabetes, AMPK activity and Thr-278 phosphorylation were substantially reduced in arterial vessel walls. These findings suggest that VASP is a new AMPK substrate, that VASP Thr-278 phosphorylation translates metabolic signals into actin cytoskeleton rearrangements, and that this signaling system becomes down-regulated in diabetic vessels.

The regulation of actin dynamics is important for cytoskeletal remodeling, cell morphology, and associated events such as cell migration, adhesion, and motility. In this complex scenario, Enabled/vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (Ena/VASP) 3The abbreviations used are: Ena/VASP, Enabled/vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein; EVH, Ena/VASP homology; PK, protein kinase; ZDF, Zucker Diabetic Fatty; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cells; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; APMP, AMP-activated protein kinase; G-actin, globular actin; F-actin, filamentous actin; SRE, serum response element; SRF, serum response factor; VASP, vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein; 8-Br, 8-bromo-; CA, constitutively active; DN, dominant negative; wt, wild type. proteins coordinate different modes of actin organization including actin filament assembly, cross-linking, and bundling. In mammals the Ena/VASP protein family comprises the VASP, Mena (the homolog of Drosophila Ena), and the Ena-VASP-like protein (Evl). These proteins participate in actin filament networks at sites of cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions and within lamellipodia and filopodia protrusions. All members of the Ena/VASP family share a tripartite domain organization consisting of an N-terminal Ena/VASP homology (EVH) domain 1 (in VASP, residues 1–115), a central proline-rich region (PRR, 115–225), and a C-terminal EVH2 domain (225–380) (1.Krause M.

Biosci. 2004; 9: 1294-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). VASP directly binds to globular actin (G-actin) and filamentous actin (F-actin) via the EVH2 domain (2.Sechi A.S. Wehland J.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3050-3061Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Residues in the C terminus of the EVH2 domain mediate tetramerization of VASP and hetero-oligomerization with other Ena/VASP family members. These interactions are important for filament elongation and branching and, consequently, for cell migration and cell-cell or cell-matrix interactions (3.Grosse R. Copeland J.W. Newsome T.P. Way M.

Ena/VASP proteins promote actin polymerization and assembly, and several models of VASP-mediated F-actin control have been proposed, including the regulation of nucleation, bundling, branching, and capping (5.Schirenbeck A.

VASP effects on actin turnover are regulated by phosphorylation, and in vitro studies have identified three serine/threonine phosphorylation sites (Ser-157, Ser-239, and Thr-278) in the protein (7.Butt E. Abel K. Krieger M. Palm D. Hoppe V. Hoppe J. Walter U. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14509-14517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both in vitro phosphorylated VASP and VASP mutants that mimic defined phosphorylation states suggest that phospho-VASP interferes with actin filament assembly, turnover, and branching. Mechanistically, VASP phosphorylation seems to modulate F-actin binding, to reduce actin-polymerization-promoting activity (8.Harbeck B. Huttelmaier S. Schluter K. Jockusch B.M. Illenberger S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30817-30825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), and to interfere with anti-capping activity (6.Barzik M. Kotova T.I. Higgs H.N. Hazelwood L.

Originally, VASP phosphorylation was described in platelets, where both cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinases (PKA and PKG, respectively) were shown to phosphorylate residues Ser-157 and Ser-239 (9.Halbrugge M. Friedrich C. Eigenthaler M. Schanzenbacher P. Walter U. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3088-3093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, the importance of phospho-Ser-157 (pSer-157) and phospho-Ser-239 (pSer-239) in cyclic-nucleotide dependent-kinase signaling cascades was established in other cardiovascular cells including aortic smooth muscle cells (10.Zhuang S. Nguyen G.T. Chen Y. Gudi T. Eigenthaler M. Jarchau T. Walter U. Boss G.R. Pilz R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10397-10407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and endothelial cells (11.Smolenski A. Poller W. Walter U. Lohmann S.M. J. Biol.

Lohmann S.M. Hofmann F. Walter U. Circulation. 2003; 108: 2172-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). To quantify the magnitude of phosphorylation at these sites, phosphorylation-specific antibodies anti-pSer-157 (5C6) and anti-pSer-239 (16C2) were developed (11.Smolenski A. Poller W. Walter U. Lohmann S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25723-25732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Analyses based on these antibodies revealed that reduced Ser-157/Ser-239 phosphorylation was associated with defective nitric oxide (NO)/cGMP signaling and endothelial dysfunction (13.Schulz E. Tsilimingas N. Rinze R. Reiter B. Wendt M. Oelze M. Woelken-Weckmuller S. Walter U. Reichenspurner H. Meinertz T. Munzel T. Circulation. 2002; 105: 1170-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Although PKA and PKG may phosphorylate purified VASP at Thr-278 to a small extent in vitro (7.Butt E. Abel K. Krieger M. Palm D. Hoppe V. Hoppe J. Walter U. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14509-14517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a role for cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation of Thr-278 in vivo has never been convincingly demonstrated. Indeed, neither the kinase responsible for Thr-278 phosphorylation nor the functional consequences of Thr-278 phosphorylation have been resolved. The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a major regulator of metabolism not only at the cellular but also at the whole organism level (14.Carling D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 18-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar, 15.Kahn B.B. Alquier T. Carling D. Hardie D.G. Cell Metab. 2005; 1: 15-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2347) Google Scholar). The evolutionarily conserved AMPK is a ubiquitously expressed heterotrimeric protein composed of a catalytic α subunit harboring a serine/threonine kinase domain and two regulatory β and γ subunits (14.Carling D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 18-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar, 16.Hardie D.G. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 5179-5183Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). AMP, generated from metabolic stress-induced ATP depletion, activates the AMPK allosterically. Two signaling pathways involving the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase and the tumor suppressor LKB1 (also referred to as STK11) activate AMPK by phosphorylating its activation loop at Thr-172 (17.Lizcano J.M. Goransson O. Toth R. Deak M. Morrice N.A. Boudeau J. Hawley S.A. Udd L. Makela T.P. Hardie D.G. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar, 18.Woods A.

Once activated, AMPK phosphorylates and inactivates several key enzymes in energy-consuming biosynthetic pathways, thereby conserving ATP pools and preserving cellular energy homeostasis. Substrates of AMPK include acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, and glycogen synthase, enzymes that control the synthesis of fatty acids, cholesterol, and glycogen, respectively (for review, see Refs. 19.Kemp B.E.

Disturbance of AMPK activity has been linked to the pathogenesis of type II diabetes mellitus and obesity (22.Zhou G. Myers R. Li Y. Chen Y. Shen X. Fenyk-Melody J. Wu M. Ventre J. Doebber T.

Med. 2006; 12: 511-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We identified AMPK in a screen for kinases that phosphorylate VASP residue Thr-278 in endothelial cells. Studies using pharmacological agents, in vitro phosphorylations, and constitutively active and dominant negative AMPK mutants confirmed that VASP is a novel AMPK substrate. AMPK specifically targets the VASP Thr-278 site. Functionally, AMPK-mediated VASP Thr-278 phosphorylation reduced F-actin assembly, resulting in defective stress fiber formation and altered cell morphology. In arterial vessel walls from Zucker Diabetic Fatty (ZDF) rats, which serve as a model for type II diabetes mellitus, AMPK activity and VASP Thr-278 phosphorylation were severely reduced. Taken together, our data show that metabolic signals via AMPK-mediated VASP Thr-278 phosphorylation may inhibit actin polymerization. In this way our study establishes a novel signaling pathway that directly links cytoskeleton dynamics to energy metabolism that is impaired in diabetic vessels. Animals− 4–7-month-old male ZDF (fa/fa) rats (615.0 ± 24.9 g) with overt diabetes and their non-diabetic lean controls (+/+, 392.4 ± 35.2 g) were from Harlan Winkelmann. Animal studies were approved by the Regierung of Unterfranken. Cell Culture−Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC, Cambrex Bioproducts) were cultivated as described (25.Profirovic J.

ECV304, HEK293, and HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 4.5 g/liter glucose supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (26.Renne T. Schuh K. Muller-Esterl W. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 3377-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Generation and Characterization of Anti-pThr-278 Antibody− To generate antibodies that specifically recognize phospho-Thr-278 (pThr-278) VASP, rabbits were immunized with the following phosphopeptide coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin: 273CRRKApTQVGE282 (pT is phosphothreonine). The antibody was immuno-selected using columns with immobilized phosphopeptide followed by a column with unphosphorylated VASP peptide. Antibodies against the corresponding non-phosphorylated VASP-peptide (anti-Thr-278) were immunopurified from the latter column and applied to the column with immobilized phosphopeptide to remove pThr-278-cross-reacting antibodies. To test the specificity of anti-pThr-278 antibodies for 273CRRKApTQVGE282, titer plates (Maxisorb, Nunc) were coated by overnight incubation with 100 μg/ml each of the phospho- and the unphosphorylated-VASP peptide. Anti-pThr-278 antibodies were applied in a serial 1:2 dilutions (starting concentration 2 μg/ml; 13 nm) and specific bound antibody was detected with a secondary peroxidase-conjugated antibody to rabbit immunoglobulin (diluted 1:4000) and a diammonium 2,29-azino-bis(3-ethyl-2,3-dihydrobenzthiazoline-6-sulfonate) substrate solution for 30 min. The change of absorbance was read at 405 nm. All incubations were done at 37 °C except for the coating step, which was done at 4 °C. Cloning of VASP Mutants−VASP mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange Multi kit (Stratagene). Human VASP cDNA in a pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) and the following primers were used to exchange Ser-157, Ser-239, and Thr-278 with alanine or glutamic acid, respectively: 5′-CG GAG CAC ATA GAG CGC CGG GTC GCC AAT GCA GGA GGC CCA CC-3′ (S157A); 5′-GGA GCC AAA CTC AGG AAA GTC GCC AAG CAG GAG GAG GCC TCA GGG-3′ (S239A); 5′-G CTG GCC CGG AGA AGG AAA GCC GCG CAA GTT GGG GAG AAA ACC-3′ (T278A) and 5′-G CTG GCC CGG AGA AGG AAA GCC GAG CAA GTT GGG GAG AAA ACC-3′ (T278E). Based on the amino acids present at positions 157, 239, and 278, respectively, VASP mutants were designated AAA, AAE, and AAT. All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequence analyses. Screen for Kinases That Phosphorylate Thr-278 in Cells−To screen for kinases that may phosphorylate the VASP Thr-278 residue, confluent HUVEC, ECV304, or HEK293 cells, transiently transfected with cDNAs coding for human VASP in a pcDNA3 vector, were treated with protein kinase activators or inhibitors. After incubation, the relative amount of pThr-278 in inhibitor- or activator-treated cells was quantified by Western blot analysis with anti-pThr-278 antibody. PKA inhibitors used were H89 (0.5–5 μm for 10–60 min, Sigma) and Rp-8Br-cAMPS (50–500 μm for 10–60 min, BioLog), and PKA activators used were Forskolin (1–10 μm for 0.5–60 min, Sigma) and 8-Br-cAMP (50–200 μm for 0.5–60 min, BioLog). PKG effects on Thr-278 phosphorylation were analyzed with the inhibitor Rp-8-Br-cGMPS (50–500 μm for 10–60 min, BioLog) and with the activators sodium nitroprusside (0.5–20 μm for 1–60 min, Sigma) and 8-Br-cGMP (50–200 μm, 0.5–60 min, BioLog). PKC was analyzed using the inhibitors Bis I (0.5–50 μm for 0.5–8 h, Calbiochem) and Rottlerin (1–10 μm for 0.5–8 h, Sigma) and the activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (0.1–10 μm for 2–30 min, Sigma). To inhibit Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, we utilized KN93 (0.5–5 μm for 0.5–8 h, Sigma), Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II peptide (0.5–5 μm for 0.5–8 h, Calbiochem), or Calcimycin (1–10 μm for 10–30 min, Sigma) for stimulation. PKB (Akt) was investigated by Wortmannin (0.1–10 μm for 0.5–8 h, Calbiochem) and fetal calf serum (0.5–20% for 0.5–3 h, Invitrogen). AMPK-driven Thr-278 was assessed using the AMPK activators Metformin (1,1-dimethylbiguanide, 0.5–8 mm for 10–60 min, Sigma), Phenformin (phenethylbiguanide, 0.5–8 mm for 10–60 min, Sigma), and AICAR (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1β-riboside, 0.5–2.5 mm for 10–30 min, Calbiochem) and AMPK inhibitors compound C (2–20 μm for 0.5–8 h, Calbiochem) and Indirubine (indirubine-3-oxime, 0.5–20 μm for 0.5–8 h, Tocris). Transfection Experiments−ECV304 and HeLa cells were cultivated in 6-well plates to 70% confluence and transiently transfected with 1.0 μg of cDNA coding for an Myc-tagged constitutively active AMPK α1 subunit mutant (CAα), a dominant negative AMPK α1 form (DNα), or the wild-type α1 subunit (wtα) (29.Woods A. Azzout-Marniche D. Fouretz M. Stein S.C. LeMarchand P. Ferré P. Foufelle F. Carling D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6704-6711Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) using GenePorter 2 with Booster Reagent 2 (Peqlab). After 24 h of expression washed cells were lysed, and pThr-278 levels were determined by Western blot analysis with anti-pThr-278 antibodies. Transfection efficiency was controlled by transfecting with a pcDNA3GFP vector, which encodes green fluorescent protein. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that ∼35–40% HeLa and 20–25% ECV304 cells stained positive for GFP after 24 h of expression. Analysis of VASP Phosphorylation−Cells or tissue were immediately lysed in sample buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 10% glycerol. Lysates were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and electro-transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schüll). Proteins on blots were probed using antibodies against AMPKα, phospho-AMPKα, phospho-ACC (Cell Signaling Technology), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Chemicon), Myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), VASP (M4, (9.Halbrugge M. Friedrich C. Eigenthaler M. Schanzenbacher P. Walter U. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3088-3093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), pSer-157-VASP (5C6, (11.Smolenski A. Poller W. Walter U.

Detection was performed using a chemiluminescence technique (ECL Plus, Amersham Biosciences.). The intensity of the individual bands on the x-ray films (XBA, Fotochemische Werke Berlin) was quantified by densitometric scans (Scan Pack 3.0, Biometra). Immunochemistry−Formaline fixed and permeabilized HeLa cells in 2-well Chamberslides (Nunc), and aortic rat tissues cryosections were incubated overnight with primary antibodies against VASP (polyclonal M4 and monoclonal IE273 (28.Abel K. Mieskes G. Walter U. FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar)) and phospho-VASP (see above) followed by secondary anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated to Alexafluor 488 or 594 (Molecular Probes) for 1 h. All incubations were performed in 5% goat serum, phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature. Stained sections were investigated using a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope equipped with a C1 confocal scanning head and a 100× oil immersion objective. Images were acquired using the EZ-C1 2.10 software from Nikon. Quantification of Cellular F-actin Content by FACS−HeLa cells were co-transfected (GenePorter 2 and Booster Reagent 2, Peqlab) with pcDNA3 vectors coding for VASP mutants (AAA, AAE, AAT; 2.5 μg each) or Myc-tagged AMPK α1 subunits corresponding to wild-type (wtα), a constitutively active mutant (CAα), or a dominant negative (DNα) mutant (5 μg each) (29.Woods A. Azzout-Marniche D. Fouretz M. Stein S.C. LeMarchand P. Ferré P. Foufelle F. Carling D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6704-6711Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). After 24 h of expression in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with all supplements, cells were trypsinized, fixed, permeabilized (see above), and co-stained for F-actin using Alexa-fluor 647 phalloidin and for Myc-tagged AMPKα1 subunit using anti-Myc antibody followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse antibody. The mean cellular F-actin content determined by phalloidin staining of overexpressing cells was quantified using FACScan (BD Biosciences) as described (3.Grosse R. Copeland J.W. Newsome T.P. Way M. Treisman R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3050-3061Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Reporter Gene Assays−We utilized a serum response factor (SRF)-based transactivation assay to quantify changes in cellular actin dynamics as described (30.Sotiropoulos A. Gineitis D. Copeland J. Treisman R. Cell. 1999; 98: 159-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 31.Geneste O. Copeland J.W. Treisman R. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 831-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Briefly, HeLa cells grown on 6-well plates were transiently transfected using GenePorter2 and Booster2. Each transfection mix includes cDNAs coding for VASP mutants (0.1 μg), AMPK mutants (0.5 μg), serum response element (SRE) reporter vector (0.5 μg, pSRE, Stratagene), Renilla luciferase control vector (0.25 μg, phRL-TK, Promega), and pcDNA3 vector without insert (0.55 μg, Invitrogen). After 24 h cells were lysed, and luciferase activities were measured in the supernatants using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) with a luminometer (Lumat, Berthold). Firefly luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity and expressed relative to MOCK-(set to 0%) and VASP AAA-transfected cells (set to 100%). In Vitro VASP Phosphorylation−AMPK phosphorylation assays were performed at 30 °C in 40 μl reaction mixtures containing 80 ng of purified recombinant human VASP and 100 milliunits of purified AMPK (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) in reaction buffer (5 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25% Nonidet P-40, 7.5 mm MgCl2, 50 μm ATP, 300 μm AMP). Reactions were stopped at different time points by the addition of SDS sample buffer and heating at 90 °C for 10 min. Statistics−Results were expressed as the means ± S.D. Comparisons between two groups were analyzed using Student’s t tests. Significant difference was defined as p values <0.05. AMP-activated Protein Kinase Phosphorylates VASP at Position Thr-278−To analyze VASP Thr-278 phosphorylation and to identify the kinase that phosphorylates residue Thr-278, we generated a phosphorylation status-specific anti-peptide antibody (anti-pThr-278) using a phosphopeptide spanning the Thr-278 phosphorylation site (273CRRKApTQVGE282). Immunopurified antibody specifically bound to the phosphopeptide but not to the unphosphorylated control (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, anti-pThr-278 did not cross-react with recombinant unphosphorylated VASP in Western blotting (see Fig. 3, upper lane, t = 0 min). To confirm that anti-pThr-278 detects the phosphorylation status of cellular VASP at the third site, we overexpressed VASP and protein phosphatase 2B, which has been shown to dephosphorylate pThr-278-VASP (28.Abel K. Mieskes G. Walter U. FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Results from Western blots incubated with anti-pThr-278 indicated that protein phosphatase 2B dose-dependently decreased pThr-278 in HEK293 cells (Fig. 1B). Together, the data confirm the specificity of anti-pThr-278 antibody for pThr-278 in vivo.FIGURE 3AMPK specifically targets VASP residue Thr-278 in vitro. Purified recombinant human VASP (80 ng) was incubated with active AMPK (100 milliunits) at 30 °C. At different time points (0.5, 2, 8, 30 min), aliquots were collected, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed for phosphorylation by immunoblotting using phospho-specific antibodies directed against the VASP phosphorylation sites Thr-278 (anti-pThr-278), Ser-157 (anti-pSer-157), or Ser-239 (anti-pSer-239). Polyclonal anti-VASP antibodies quantified total VASP in the samples. The blot is representative of four independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Using anti-pThr-278, we systematically screened for serine-threonine kinases that may phosphorylate VASP in intact cells. First, we selected kinases whose consensus sequences matched the Thr-278 flanking residues. Subsequently, endothelial cell lines (ECV304 and HUVEC), which express a high amount of endogenous VASP (11.Smolenski A. Poller W. Walter U. Lohmann S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25723-25732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), as well as HEK293 cells, which transiently overexpress VASP, were incubated with specific activators or inhibitors of the selected kinases and analyzed for pThr-278 and total VASP by Western blotting (described under “Experimental Procedures” in detail). Pretreatment with the PKA activator Forskolin clearly augmented pSer-157 in ECV304 cells as indicated by the phospho-specific antibody (anti-pSer-157), Fig. 1C, lower panel). Phosphorylation of Ser-157 of VASP led to a shift in apparent molecular mass in SDS-PAGE from 46 to 50 kDa, and anti-VASP antibodies detected the characteristic doublet of Ser-157-non-phosphorylated and -phosphorylated protein after stimulation (anti-VASP, Fig. 1C, middle panel, the upper band was detected by anti-pSer-157). Notably, PKA activation did not increase pThr-278 over basal levels. Summarized pThr-278 signal intensities of the doublet did not significantly differ from the pThr-278 level of VASP from unstimulated cells (100 versus 97 ± 8%, Fig. 1C, upper panel and column bar). Furthermore, relative signal intensities of the 46- and 50-kDa band from anti-pThr-278 and anti-VASP blots were not obviously different (Fig. 1C, compare upper and middle panels), suggesting that phosphorylation at Thr-278 occurred independent of the Ser-157 phosphorylation status. Similarly, PKG activators such as 8-Br-cGMP failed to change Thr-278 phosphorylation in cells (100 versus 105 ± 9%, Fig. 1C, right, upper panel and column bar). Under these conditions the activator clearly increased phosphorylation of the PKG-preferred VASP phosphorylation site, Ser-239 (Fig. 1C, lower panel, anti-pSer-239). Note, in contrast to phosphorylation at the first site, phosphorylation at the second site does not induce a shift in molecular weight (middle panel, anti-VASP). Furthermore, pThr-278 was independent of PKC, PKB, or Ca2+/Calmodulin-dependent protein kinase activity (not shown). Next, we wondered whether the AMPK may phosphorylate VASP at Thr-278. AMPK activity inhibitors Indirubine and compound C, concentration (Fig. 2A)- and time-dependent (Fig. 2B), significantly decreased pThr-278 by up to 45% relative to basal pThr-278 levels in untreated HUVEC. Consistently, AMPK activating agents such as Metformin, Phenformin, or 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1β-riboside increased pThr-278 in a concentration (Fig. 2C)- and time-dependent (Fig. 2D) manner up to maximally 56, 72, and 73%, respectively, over basal levels. All tested AMPK inhibitors and activators similarly affected pThr-278 levels in HEK293 and ECV304 cells (data not shown), suggesting that VASP might be a novel AMPK substrate in vivo. Notably, in non-stimulated HUVEC about 40% of total VASP was phosphorylated at Thr-"
https://openalex.org/W2033421880,"Neutral sphingomyelinases (N-SMases) are major candidates for stress-induced ceramide production. However, there is little information on the physiological regulation and roles of the cloned N-SMase enzyme, nSMase2. In this study, nSMase2 was found to translocate acutely to the plasma membrane of A549 epithelial cells in response to tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Additionally, TNF-α increased N-SMase activity rapidly and transiently both endogenously and in cells overexpressing nSMase2. Furthermore, the translocation of nSMase2 was regulated by p38-α MAPK, but not ERK or JNK, and the increase in endogenous N-SMase activity was abrogated by p38 MAPK inhibition. In addition, both p38-α MAPK and nSMase2 were implicated in the TNF-α-stimulated up-regulation of the adhesion proteins vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM), but this was largely independent of NF-κB activation. These data reveal p38 MAPK as an upstream regulator of nSMase2 and indicate a role for nSMase2 in pro-inflammatory responses induced by TNF-α as a regulator of adhesion proteins.

The bioactive role of ceramide in the cellular responses to stress is well established (1Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25847-25850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar).

Hannun Y.A. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 82: 27-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Of these, the Mg2+-dependent neutral SMases (N-SMases) are prime candidates for stress-induced ceramide production. To date, two proteins with both in vitro and in vivo N-SMase activity have been cloned and termed nSMase2 and nSMase3 (3Hofmann K. Tomiuk S. Nix M. Zumbansen M. Stoffel W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5895-5900Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar,4Krut O. Wiegmann K. Kashkar H. Yazdanpanah B. Kronke M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 81: 13784-13793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Previous research found that confluence induces translocation of nSMase2 to the plasma membrane (PM), resulting in an increase of ceramide levels (5Marchesini N. Osta W. Bielawski J. Luberto C. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25101-25111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). H2O2 also induces translocation of nSMase2 to the PM in human airway epithelial cells. Importantly, ceramide generation induced by H2O2 is prevented by nSMase2 siRNA (6Levy M. Castilloa S.S. Goldkorn T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 344: 900-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Together, this suggests that translocation to the PM may constitute an important mechanism for nSMase2-mediated functions. However, the regulation of this process has not been investigated. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α is a pleiotropic cytokine, important in mediating systemic inflammatory and immune responses (7Aggarwal B.B. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 745-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (2164) Google Scholar). The binding of TNF-α to two PM receptors (p55 and p75) activates a number of signaling cascades, including mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and NF-κB (reviewed in Ref. 8Baud V. Karin M. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 372-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1376) Google Scholar). TNF-α has also been shown to activate SMases, producing ceramide and other downstream signaling lipids such as sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) (9Kronke M. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1999; 102: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 10Xia P. Wang L. Gamble J.R. Vadas M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34499-34505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Importantly, TNF-α was found to activate both nSMase2 and nSMase3 (4Krut O. Wiegmann K. Kashkar H.

Chem. 2003; 278: 13775-13783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Furthermore, N-SMase activation has been implicated in TNF-α-stimulated COX-2 induction in airway epithelial cells (12Chen C.-C. Sun Y.-T. Chen J.-J. Chang Y.-J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 493-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), and a recent study in TNF-α-stimulated HUVEC cells found that nSMase2 was upstream of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase activation (13De Palma C. Meacci E. Perrotta C. Bruni P. Clementi E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2006; 26: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Moreover, in hepatocytes, nSMase2 is found constitutively at the PM, where it has been implicated in the action of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 1 on JNK phosphorylation and activation (14Karakashian A.A. Giltiay N.V. Smith G.M. Nikolova-Karakashian M.N. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 968-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). As these are pro-inflammatory pathways, this suggests that N-SMase and, specifically nSMase2, may be important for TNF-α-induced inflammatory signaling. The regulated expression of adhesion proteins such as vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM) on the surface of leukocytes, epithelial cells, and vascular endothelial cells is essential for controlling migration of cells, especially in inflammatory diseases (15Pettersen C.A. Adler K.B. Chest. 2002; 121: S142-S150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 16Radi Z.A. Kehrli Jr., M.E. Ackermann M.R. J. Vet. Intern.

Carcinogenesis. 2005; 26: 943-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Previously, TNF-α was shown to up-regulate VCAM and ICAM in HUVECs and A549 cells (18Woo C.-H. Lim J.-H. Kim J.-H. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: L307-L316Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 19Billich A. Bornancin F. Mechtcheriakova D. Natt F. Huesken D. Baumruker T.

Although NF-κB activation was reported as crucial for this process, evidence also suggests the existence of additional regulatory pathways. For example, p38 MAPK was implicated in the expression of VCAM, but not ICAM, in TNF-α-stimulated A549 cells (18Woo C.-H. Lim J.-H. Kim J.-H. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: L307-L316Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 20Holden N.S. Catley M.C. Cambridge L.M. Barnes P.J. Newton R. Eur. J.

Furthermore, there is evidence implicating sphingolipids in the regulation of adhesion proteins. Studies in TNF-α-stimulated HUVEC cells report a role for sphingosine kinase and S1P in VCAM and ICAM expression and the glycosphingolipid lactosylceramide in ICAM expression (22Xia P. Gamble J.R. Rye K.-A. Wang L. Hii C.S. Cockerill P. Khew-Goodall Y. Bert A.G. Barter P.J. Vadas M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 941-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar); in all cases, this was through regulation of the NF-κB pathway. However, there is conflicting evidence as to the role of ceramide in expression of adhesion proteins, with reports that ceramide generated by bacterial SMase treatment is able to induce expression of VCAM and ICAM whereas exogenously added ceramide cannot (22Xia P. Gamble J.R. Rye K.-A. Wang L. Hii C.S. Cockerill P. Khew-Goodall Y. Bert A.G. Barter P.J. Vadas M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 13094-13102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Thus, the involvement of ceramide may be specific to that generated endogenously. However, to date, no study has investigated the role of endogenous ceramide-producing enzymes in regulation of adhesion proteins. In this study, we sought to investigate the regulation of nSMase2 in a TNF-α-stimulated inflammatory context and its role in the up-regulation of adhesion proteins. We found that TNF-α induces acute translocation and activation of nSMase2 in A549 cells and this requires p38 MAPK. Furthermore, both nSMase2 and p38-α MAPK are involved in TNF-α-stimulated VCAM and ICAM induction, and this is independent of NF-κB activation. These data shed light on the role of nSMase2 in a physiological model of inflammation and, for the first time, identify p38 MAPK as an upstream regulator of nSMase2. Cell Culture and siRNA—A549 cells were maintained in 10% fetal bovine serum in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. For siRNA experiments, cells were seeded in 60-mm dishes (5-7.5 × 104/dish). After 24 h, cells were transfected with scramble or specific siRNA (20 nm) using Oligofectamine according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were allowed to grow for 48 h (p38-α, nSMase3) or 72 h (nSMase2) prior to experiments. siRNA oligonucleotides for Scr and nSMase2 were as described previously (5Marchesini N. Osta W. Bielawski J. Luberto C. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25101-25111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Predesigned siRNA oligonucleotides for nSMase3 (number 55627) were purchased from Qiagen. Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—MCF-7 (2.5 × 104 subconfluent; 9.0 × 104 confluent), human embryonic kidney, HeLa, and A549 cells (2.5 × 104) were seeded in 35-mm confocal dishes, and 48 h later cells were transiently transfected with 0.3 μg of 3′-V5-tagged nSMase2 using Effectene (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After 12 h, medium was replaced, and cells allowed to grow for a further 6-12 h. With A549, cells were then stimulated with TNF-α (50 ng/ml for various times, various concentrations for 30 min). For Golgi disruption experiments, subconfluent MCF-7 cells were incubated with brefeldin A (2.5 μg/ml) for 1 h prior to fixation. For MAPK inhibitor experiments, A549 cells were preincubated with PD98059, SP600125, or SB202190 (10 μm or varying concentrations as indicated) for 1 h prior to stimulation. Cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde (4%, 10 min), permeabilized with 100% methanol (5 min, -20 °C), and blocked with 2% human serum in PBS (>30 min, room temperature). Cells were probed with anti-V5 antibody (1:200) and anti-giantin (1:200) in 2% serum (2 h, room temperature), washed (3× PBS), probed with fluorescent secondary antibody (1:200 anti-mouse 488; 1:100 anti-rabbit Rhodamine; 30-45 min, room temperature, dark) and washed (3× PBS). Cells were viewed on a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta Confocal Microscope. Immunoblotting—Protein samples were separated on 4-20% gradient gels (Bio-Rad Criterion) at 60-100 V before transfer to nitrocellulose membrane in Tris/glycine buffer (100 V, 30 min, 4 °C). Membranes were blocked (5% milk, >30 min) and probed with primary antibody overnight (4 °C). Membranes were washed (3× 0.1% Tween Trisbuffered saline), probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:5000 mouse or rabbit in 5% milk) for 30-45 min at room temperature, and washed (3× 0.1% Tween Tris-buffered saline). Proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). Cell Adhesion Assay—A549 cells (2 × 104) were seeded in glass-bottomed 6-well trays (Corning). After 24 h, cells were transfected with Scr or nSMase2 siRNA (20 nm, 72 h) before stimulation with TNF-α (50 ng/ml) or vehicle for 3 h. Meanwhile, U87 cells were labeled with Green 5-chloromethylfluorescein diacetate (Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer's instructions and were trypsinized. Following TNF-α stimulation of A549 cells, U87 cells were added in fresh medium (1 × 105 cells/well), and cells were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h before fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde. Fluorescent U87 cells were visualized on a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta Confocal Microscope. For quantification, U87 cells in 15 random fields were counted. Numbers were normalized to A549 protein levels, determined by BCA assay (26Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C.

Immunoprecipitation—Following stimulation with TNF-α (50 ng/ml; 0, 10, 30 min), mock- or V5-transfected cells were lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer by sonication (3 × 10 s, 2 intensities), and unbroken cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 5 min. Following protein estimation by Bradford assay (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar), equal protein from each sample was precleared with 30 μl of Protein A/G-agarose-conjugated beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at 4°C. Samples were then rotated overnight with primary antibody (1 μg) at 4 °C. The following day, 50 μl of beads were added and samples rotated for at least 3 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed (2× PBS) and vortexed well with 2× sample buffer to obtain immunoprecipitates. Both supernatants and immunoprecipitates were boiled for 5-10 min before analysis by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting as described above. Real-time Reverse Transcription-PCR—mRNA was extracted from A549 cells treated with Scr or nSMase3 siRNA, and nSMase3 mRNA levels were quantified by real-time reverse transcription PCR as described previously (5Marchesini N.

Scintillation mixture Safety Solve was from Research Products International. Role for nSMase2 in TNF-α-stimulated Induction of VCAM and ICAM—Evidence suggests that nSMase2 may be important for TNF-α-stimulated inflammatory signaling (13De Palma C. Meacci E. Perrotta C. Bruni P. Clementi E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2006; 26: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Therefore, the role of nSMase2 in TNF-α-stimulated induction of the adhesion proteins VCAM and ICAM in lung epithelial cells was investigated. Using siRNA as previously reported (5Marchesini N. Osta W. Bielawski J. Luberto C. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25101-25111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), the expression of nSMase2 was down-regulated. A549 cells were treated with scrambled RNA (Scr) or nSMase2 siRNA (20 nm, 72 h) and stimulated with TNF-α (50 ng/ml) or vehicle (PBS) for 0, 3, 6, or 12 h, and levels of VCAM and ICAM were analyzed by immunoblotting. Down-regulation of nSMase2 significantly attenuated the TNF-α-stimulated induction of VCAM and ICAM at all time points. In the presence of nSMase2 siRNA, VCAM levels were reduced by 56.1% at 3 h, 49.6% at 6 h, and 32.7% at 12 h (Fig. 1, A and B) whereas ICAM levels were reduced by 51.8% at 3 h, 39.6% at 6 h, and 34.3% at 12 h when compared with Scr controls (Fig. 1, A and C). Thus, nSMase2 is important for TNF-α-stimulated induction of VCAM and ICAM in A549 cells. To confirm the functional importance of nSMase2 as a regulator of adhesion proteins, cell adhesion assays were performed. Briefly, Scr or nSMase2 siRNA treated A549 cells were incubated with fluorescently labeled U87 cells for 1 h at 37°C, washed three times with PBS, and fixed with paraformaldehyde for quantification by confocal microscopy (Fig. 2). Results showed that TNF-α (50 ng/ml, 3 h) more than doubled the adhesion of U87 cells to A549 cells, consistent with the up-regulation of VCAM and ICAM. Furthermore, whereas nSMase2 siRNA had no significant difference on basal cell-cell adhesion, the increase in cell-cell adhesion induced by TNF-α was markedly reduced, consistent with nSMase2 siRNA effects on adhesion proteins. Thus, nSMase2 plays a role in cell-cell adhesion and as a regulator of the adhesion proteins VCAM and ICAM. To determine whether other N-SMases may also play a role in VCAM and ICAM induction, siRNA against the recently cloned nSMase3 (4Krut O. Wiegmann K. Kashkar H. Yazdanpanah B. Kronke M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 81: 13784-13793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (111) Google Scholar) was utilized. To validate the siRNA, A549 cells were transfected with Scr or nSMase3 siRNA (20 nm, 48 h) and nSMase3 mRNA levels were analyzed by realtime reverse transcription PCR. Treatment of A549 cells with nSMase3 siRNA (20 nm, 48 h) dramatically reduced nSMase3 mRNA to 17.2 ± 10.0% of Scr-treated controls (Fig. 3A; p < 0.01, n = 2). Utilizing this siRNA, the role of nSMase3 in VCAM and ICAM induction was investigated. Downregulation of nSMase3 showed a significant effect on VCAM and ICAM induction only at 3 h of TNF stimulation compared with Scr controls (p < 0.05, n = 4), and this effect was less than that observed with nSMase2 siRNA (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, although levels of both ICAM and VCAM were still slightly reduced at 6 and 12 h of stimulation, this was not statistically significant when compared with Scr controls (Fig. 3B). This suggests that nSMase3 may also play a role in induction of VCAM and ICAM, albeit comparatively minor to that of nSMase2. Localization of a V5-tagged nSMase2—Next, studies were conducted to establish the subcellular localization of nSMase2 and to examine possible translocation of the enzyme in response to TNF-α. Although, a FLAG-tagged nSMase2 was previously used (5Marchesini N. Osta W. Bielawski J. Luberto C. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25101-25111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), a high background signal was observed with anti-FLAG antibodies. Accordingly, a construct of nSMase2 tagged at the C terminus with a V5 epitope, a short peptide sequence from Paramyxovirus SV5 (28Southern J.A. Young D.F. Heaney F. Baumgartner W.K. Randall R.E. J. Gen. Virol. 1991; 72: 1551-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), was constructed. To confirm that the V5 tag had no effects on nSMase2 localization, V5-nSMase2 was overexpressed in subconfluent and confluent MCF-7 cells and its localization analyzed by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. In subconfluent MCF-7 cells, V5-nSMase2 co-localized with giantin and GM-130, indicating its presence in the Golgi (Fig. 4A); this was also observed in HeLa, human embryonic kidney, and A549 cells (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, treatment of subconfluent MCF-7 cells with brefeldin A for 1 h disrupted the Golgi, resulting in a diffuse distribution of both giantin and V5-nSMase2. This confirms localization of V5-nSMase2 to the Golgi (Fig. 4C) and agrees with previous studies on nSMase2 localization (3Hofmann K. Tomiuk S. Nix M. Zumbansen M. Stoffel W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5895-5900Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Importantly, in confluent MCF-7 cells, V5-nSMase2 localized at the plasma membrane (Fig. 4A) in agreement with our previous study in MCF-7 cells utilizing a FLAG-tagged nSMase2 (5Marchesini N. Osta W. Bielawski J. Luberto C. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25101-25111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Finally, overexpression of V5-nSMase2 significantly increased N-SMase activity of MCF-7 cells, confirming that V5-nSMase2 is active (data not shown). nSMase2 Is a TNF-α-responsive Enzyme in A549 Cells—Previously it was shown that nSMase2 is TNF-α-responsive in MCF-7 cells by measuring enzyme activity (11Marchesini N. Luberto C. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13775-13783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Therefore, it became important to determine whether TNF-α regulated nSMase2 in A549 lung epithelial carcinoma cells. Moreover, we were specifically interested to determine whether TNF-α regulated the subcellular localization of the enzyme. In unstimulated A549 cells, V5-nSMase2 strongly co-localized with the Golgi marker giantin, consistent with results from MCF-7, HeLa, and human embryonic kidney cells (Fig. 4B). Stimulation with TNF-α (50 ng/ml) induced a rapid (5-10 min) translocation to the PM that was sustained up to 60 min (Fig. 5A). To further characterize the TNF-α-induced translocation of nSMase2, a dose response at 30 min of stimulation was performed. At concentrations of 1 and 10 ng/ml TNF-α nSMase2 was intracellular, mainly localizing to the Golgi. However, concentrations of 25 ng/ml TNF-α and higher were sufficient to induce PM translocation of nSMase2 (Fig. 5B). As confirmation that nSMase2 is a TNF-responsive enzyme, N-SMase activity was assayed in A549 cells with and without nSMase2 overexpression. In both cases, TNF-α rapidly and transiently increased N-SMase activity, with peak activity observed at 5 min (Fig. 5C). Furthermore, the remarkably similar effects of TNF-α on endogenous and overexpressed N-SMase activity suggests that nSMase2 is a major contributor to TNF-α-stimulated N-SMase activity in A549 cells. Role of p38-MAPK in TNF-α-induced Induction of VCAM and ICAM—A previous study implicated p38 MAPK in the regulation of VCAM, but not ICAM, in response to TNF-α (18Woo C.-H. Lim J.-H. Kim J.-H. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: L307-L316Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Therefore, it became important to determine the role of p38 MAPK with respect to nSMase2 in mediating the effects of TNF-α. Initially, studies were conducted to investigate the role of specific MAPKs in mediating the actions of TNF-α. Therefore, the effects of inhibitors of ERK-1/2, JNK, or p38 MAPK on induction of ICAM and VCAM were investigated. A549 cells were treated with 10 μm PD98059, SP600125, or SB202190 for 1 h prior to stimulation with TNF-α (50 ng/ml) for 3 h. Neither ERK nor JNK inhibition significantly reduced VCAM or ICAM induction; levels of both proteins were significantly increased compared with controls. However, p38-MAPK inhibition significantly attenuated the induction of VCAM (52.3% reduction) and modestly attenuated the induction of ICAM (21.2% reduction) (Fig. 6A).FIGURE 6Dependence of VCAM and ICAM induction on p38 MAPK, but not ERK or JNK. A549 cells (5-7 × 105) were seeded in 60-mm dishes. A, 48 h later, cells were preincubated with PD98059, SP600125, or SB202190 (10 μm, 1 h) prior to stimulation with TNF-α (3 nm, 3 h). Protein samples were prepared and VCAM and ICAM levels analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting (*, p < 0.05, n = 4). B, 24 h later, cells were transfected with either Scr or p38-α siRNA (20 nm). After 48 h, medium was changed and cells were stimulated with TNF-α (3 nm) or vehicle (PBS) for 3, 6, or 12 h, and protein samples were prepared and VCAM and ICAM levels analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Immunblot is representative of five independent experiments. C, quantification of VCAM levels in the presence of Scr and p38-α siRNA (*, p < 0.05, n = 5). D, quantification of ICAM levels in the presence of Scr and p38-α siRNA (*, p < 0.05, n = 5).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To corroborate these results and to further explore the role of p38 MAPK in induction of adhesion proteins, siRNA specific to p38-α, a ubiquitous p38 isoform, was utilized. Transfection of A549 cells with p38-α siRNA (20 nm, 48 h) significantly down-regulated p38 MAPK protein levels to 30.1 ± 4.8% of Scr controls, confirming its effectiveness (Fig. 6B). Importantly, down-regulation of p38-α MAPK significantly reduced VCAM expression at all time points (Fig. 6, B and C), consistent with the effect of p38 MAPK inhibitors with levels reduced by 61.2% at 3 h, 58.4% at 6 h, and 29.7% at 12 h. Furthermore, induction of ICAM was also inhibited with levels reduced by 31.6% at 3 h, 29.5% at 6 h, and 24.1% at 12 h (Fig. 6, B and D). Thus, p38-α MAPK, but not other MAPKs, is an upstream regulator of adhesion proteins in TNF-α-stimulated A549 cells. nSMase2 and p38 Do Not Act Upstream of NF-κB Activation—Considerable evidence in the literature has implicated NF-κBin transcriptional regulation of VCAM and ICAM in response to TNF-α (18Woo C.-H.

To determine whether nSMase2 and p38-α MAPK act upstream of this pathway, the effects of nSMase2 or p38-α MAPK down-regulation on activation of the NF-κB pathway by TNF-α were examined. Because the primary mechanism of action of TNF-α involves the induction of loss of IκB-α, the inhibitory protein for NF-κB, the levels of IκB-α in response to TNF-α stimulation between 0-60 min were determined. TNF-α induced a rapid and transient decrease in IκB-α protein levels (Fig. 7) consistent with previous reports (29Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1995; 80: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). However, downregulation of either nSMase2 (Fig. 7A) or p38-α MAPK (Fig. 7B) had no significant effects on either basal IκB-α levels or IκB-α"
https://openalex.org/W2029122958,"We studied the kinetics of sublimating crystals with single-particle resolution by experiments with colloidal spheres and by computer simulations. A short-range attraction between spheres led to crystallites one to three layers thick. The spheres were tracked with optical microscopy while the attraction was reduced and the crystals sublimated. Large crystallites sublimated by escape of particles from the perimeter. The rate of shrinkage was greatly enhanced, however, when the size decreased to less than 20 to 50 particles, depending on the location in the phase diagram. At this size, the crystallites transformed into a dense amorphous structure, which rapidly vaporized. The enhancement of kinetics by metastable or unstable phases may play a major role in the melting, freezing, and annealing of crystals."

Pyrolysis, coupled with catalytic oxidation of the fuels and their fragments upon impact with a hot rhodium-cerium catalyst surface, avoids the formation of deactivating carbon layers on the catalyst. The catalytic reactions of these products generate approximately 1 megawatt of heat per square meter, which maintains the catalyst surface above 800 degrees C at high drop impact rates. At these temperatures, heavy fuels can be catalytically transformed directly into hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and other small molecules in very short contact times without the formation of carbon."

In all three constructs, we found two main unfolding peaks; the first corresponds to a transition state placed close to the termini and the second to a transition state placed halfway through the molecule. We attribute the second transition state to the shear rupture of the β1- and β6-strands, which we verified by introducing a point mutation in this region. Although both unfolding peaks were observed in all three EYFP variants, their relative frequency of occurrence varied. Our results demonstrated that the mechanical unfolding pathways in EYFP could be deciphered through the use of circular permutation."

Through its interaction with the VEGF receptor, KDR/Flk-1, VEGF mediates most angiogenic processes, such as proliferation, survival, adhesion, migration, capillary morphogenesis (tube formation), and the gene expression of endothelial cells (1Ferrara N. Davis-Smyth T. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 4-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar, 2Neufeld G. Cohen T. Gengrinovitch S. Poltorak Z. Faseb J. 1999; 13: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (3128) Google Scholar). One of the mechanisms by which VEGF promotes angiogenesis is via up-regulation of the expression and/or activation of integrins.Integrins, the major receptors for extracellular matrix (ECM) components, mediate cell adhesion to the ECM (4Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8966) Google Scholar, 5Hynes R.O. Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6759) Google Scholar). The integrin family comprises at least 24 different heterodimers, with 18 α- and 8 β-subunits and distinct and often overlapping specificity for ECM proteins (5Hynes R.O. Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6759) Google Scholar). Integrins activated by engagement with their ligands can transduce various signals, such as calcium influx or activation of kinases, from the extracellular environment to the interior of the cells (6Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2809) Google Scholar, 7Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

This process is known as “outside-in” signaling. In addition, the active status of integrins can be achieved by growth factor-induced signaling pathways, a process known as “inside-out” signaling. Thus, blocking the functions of specific integrins can exert profound effects on the angiogenic response of endothelial cells, indicating that integrins are directly implicated in angiogenic processes (9Fassler R. Meyer M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1896-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar, 10Hynes R.O. Bader B.L. Thromb. Haemost. 1997; 78: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 11Eliceiri B.P.

Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar).Through “inside-out” signaling, VEGF activates various integrins. These integrins include the fibronectin receptor α5β1, collagen receptor α2β1 as well as the vitronectin receptors αvβ3 and αvβ5 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) (13Byzova T.V.

Thus, the functional blocking of these integrins inhibits VEGF-induced angiogenesis. In addition to these integrin signalings, alterations in integrin expression were reported to contribute to angiogenesis. For example, VEGF increases the migration of human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMECs) through the up-regulation of αvβ3 integrin expression (14Senger D.R. Ledbetter S.R. Claffey K.P.

VEGF was also reported to increase the expression of α1β1 and α2β1 integrins in HDMECs, while blocking antibodies of these integrins markedly inhibited VEGF-induced angiogenesis and tumor growth in vivo (15Senger D.R. Claffey K.P. Benes J.E. Perruzzi C.A. Sergiou A.P. Detmar M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13612-13617Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 16Senger D.R. Perruzzi C.A. Streit M.

Thus, VEGF modulates angiogenesis via regulation of the expression and/or activation of integrins.VEGF induces significant changes in the permeability of the endothelium and is expressed in some breast cancer cells (17Lee T.H.

Jiang S. Avraham S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5277-5284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). We previously reported that VEGF significantly increased penetration of the highly metastatic MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells across the HBMEC monolayer (18Lee T.H. Avraham H.K. Jiang S. Avraham S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5277-5284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). We also observed that VEGF modulated the transendothelial migration (TM) of breast tumor cells by regulating the integrity of the HBMEC monolayer (17Lee T.H. Avraham H. Lee S.H. Avraham S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10445-10451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 18Lee T.H. Avraham H.K. Jiang S. Avraham S. J. Biol.

Thus, VEGF might contribute to breast cancer metastasis by enhancing the TM of tumor cells through its effects on endothelial integrity.In this study, we examined the effects of VEGF on integrin expression and activation in HBMECs. Until recently, the role of VEGF in the regulation of integrins was not well defined because of their high redundancy. To directly investigate this topic, we first used human cDNA arrays containing 12 α- and 8 β-subunits as well as RNase protection assays (RPAs) covering 16 α- and 8 β-subunits, which include most of the known integrins. By using these tools, we observed that VEGF potently induced the expression of α6 integrin mRNA in these cells. The α6 integrin, which constitutes a subunit of the α6β1 and α6β4 integrins, is known to be a receptor for laminins (19Cress A.E. Rabinovitz I. Zhu W. Nagle R.B. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1995; 14: 219-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 20Lotz M.M. Korzelius C.A. Mercurio A.M.

Baron-Van Evercooren A. Georges-Labouesse E. French-Constant C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 833-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). However, the precise role of α6 integrin in angiogenesis has not yet been addressed.Here, we report that the α6 integrin mediated VEGF-induced angiogenesis through α6β1 integrin. We demonstrated that blocking of α6 integrin with its specific antibody inhibited VEGF-induced adhesion and migration as well as in vivo angiogenesis, and markedly suppressed tumor angiogenesis and breast carcinoma growth in vivo. These results strongly suggest that breast cancer cells secreting VEGF are able to induce the expression and activation of α6 integrin in brain microvascular endothelial cells, which may facilitate breast cancer cell migration and metastasis to the brain.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Human recombinant VEGF165 was obtained from Genentech Inc.

HBMECs were used from passage three up to passage seven and were checked routinely for the expression of von Willebrand factor. HUVECs were purchased from Cambrex Bio Science Inc. (Walkersville, MD) and cultured with EGM-2 medium.Cytokine cDNA Array Analysis—HBMECs were grown subconfluently onto attachment factor-coated 100-mm dishes. The cells were starved in serum-free CSC medium containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum (assay medium) for 4 h and then stimulated with VEGF (30 ng/ml) for 5 h. Total RNA preparation and hybridization procedures were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Equal amounts (2 μg) of total RNA from unstimulated or VEGF-stimulated HBMECs were used for preparation of the cDNA probes. The cytokine cDNA membranes (R&D Systems) were hybridized with the cDNA probes at 68 °C for 18 h. After washing, the membranes were exposed on a Phosphorimager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) and analyzed using ArrayVision™ software (Imaging Research Inc., Ontario, Canada).RNase Protection Assay—The assay was performed on total RNA using the RPA kit (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). Briefly, HBMECs were starved in assay medium for 4 h and then stimulated with VEGF (30 ng/ml) for the indicated times. The total RNA was isolated, and 5 μg of the isolated RNA was hybridized with 32P-labeled antisense RNA probes prepared using the Human Integrin Template Sets (BD Pharmingen). After digestion by RNase, the samples were separated on a 5% acrylamide gel containing 48% urea. The gel was dried and exposed on a Phosphorimager. The intensity of the protected bands was measured using Scion Image Beta 4.02 software (Scion Corp., Frederick, MD).Northern Blot Analysis—HBMECs were starved in assay medium for 4 h and then stimulated with VEGF (30 ng/ml). The isolated total RNA (10 μg) was separated on an agarose gel and transferred to a hybond N membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was hybridized with full-length cDNA to human α6 integrin (a generous gift of Dr. Leslie M. Shaw, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA) and, after washing, the blot was exposed to x-ray film. The intensity of the bands was measured using Scion Image Beta 4.02 software.mRNA Stability Analysis—HBMECs were grown subconfluently onto attachment factor-coated 100-mm dishes. The cells were starved in assay medium for 4 h and then treated with VEGF (30 ng/ml) or PBS. After 24 h, actinomycin D (5 μg/ml) was added, and the cells were harvested for RNA isolation at 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 h after the addition of actinomycin D. Northern blot analysis was performed according to the method described above. The densities of α6 integrin mRNA were measured using Scion Image Beta 4.02 software.Biotinylation and Immunoprecipitation—HBMECs were starved in assay medium for 4 h, treated with VEGF (30 ng/ml) for 24 h, and dispersed by brief treatment with 0.05% trypsin solution. Cell surface labeling with biotin was performed according to the method described previously (15Senger D.R. Claffey K.P. Benes J.E. Perruzzi C.A. Sergiou A.P. Detmar M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13612-13617Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). For the immunoprecipitations, 50 μg of total protein lysate was incubated with 2 μg of monoclonal antibody against α6, β1, and β4 integrins, respectively, and the immune complex was precipitated with protein G-Sepharose. The precipitated samples were separated by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions and then transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Boston, MA). The membranes were incubated with avidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Bio-Rad) for 1 h, and the biotinylated proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence.Western Blot Analysis—HBMECs were starved in assay medium for 4 h and then stimulated with VEGF (30 ng/ml). HBMECs were lysed in commercial lysis buffer (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (18Lee T.H. Avraham H.K. Jiang S. Avraham S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5277-5284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The intensity of the bands was measured using Scion Image Beta 4.02 software.Adhesion Assay—HBMECs were starved in serum-free CSC medium containing 1% BSA (adhesion buffer) for 4 h and dispersed for resuspension in adhesion buffer. 24-Well plates were coated with matrix proteins in adhesion buffer (50 mm NaHCO3, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.0) for 1 h at 37 °C, and nonspecific binding sites on the plates were blocked with 3% BSA in adhesion buffer for 1 h at 37 °C as described previously (13Byzova T.V.

Prior to the assays, 1 × 105 cells in 100 μl were preincubated with test antibodies (20 μg/ml) for 30 min and, in some experiments, were treated with VEGF (30 ng/ml), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, 200 nm), or MnCl2 (1 mm) for 30 min, and then added to matrix protein-coated 24-well plates at a final volume of 0.5 ml. Alternatively, siRNA-treated HBMECs were starved in assay medium for 4 h and treated with VEGF (30 ng/ml) for 24 h, then added to Laminin-1-coated 24-well plates after suspension in adhesion buffer. After 30 min of incubation, the cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde and washed extensively with PBS. Attached cells were stained by using a Hema-3 Stain Set (Fisher Inc.), then observed under an inverted microscope and counted from 15 random fields of ×400 magnification.Migration Assay—HBMECs were dispersed in 0.05% trypsin solution and resuspended in assay medium. Prior to the assays, 1 × 105 cells in 100 μl were incubated with test antibodies (20 μg/ml) for 30 min and added to Laminin-1-coated 24-well Transculture inserts with a pore size of 8 μm (Costar Corp.). Alternatively, siRNA-treated HBMECs were directly added to the Transculture inserts after suspension in assay medium. VEGF (30 ng/ml) was added to the basolateral chambers at a final volume of 0.6 ml. After 3 h of incubation, the apical chambers were fixed and stained by using a Hema-3 Stain Set. To remove non-migrating cells, the apical side of the apical chamber was scraped gently by cotton wool. The migrating cells were then observed under an inverted microscope and counted from 10 random fields of ×200 magnification.Small Interfering RNA (siRNA)—The siRNA oligonucleotides for human α6 integrin (CAACUGAAGUCACCUUUGAUU; GGAUAUGCCUCCAGGUUAAUU; CAAGACAGCUCAUAUUGAUUU; GAAAGGGAUUGUUCGUGUAUU) (cat. M-007214-00) and nonspecific control (cat. D-001206-13) siRNA were purchased from Dharmacon Inc. (Lafayette, CO). Transfection procedures were performed with oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were grown subconfluently onto 100-mm dishes or 6-well plates and transfected with 200 nm of siRNA. After 72 h of transfection, cells were washed and analyzed further as specifically indicated.Capillary Morphogenesis Assay—150 μl of Matrigel (9 mg/ml) was added to a 24-well plate and allowed to gel for 5 min at 37 °C. The HBMECs were detached by brief treatment with 0.05% trypsin solution and resuspended in CSC medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Prior to the assays, 5 × 104 cells in 100 μl were incubated with test antibodies (20 μg/ml) for 30 min and added to the plate at a final volume of 0.5 ml. Alternatively, siRNA-treated HBMECs were directly added to the plate after suspension in CSC medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. After 6 or 12 h of incubation, the cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde and observed under an inverted microscope. The lengths of the tubular-like structures were measured using Scion Image Beta 4.02 software.In Vivo Angiogenesis Assay—Assays were performed according to the method described previously (15Senger D.R. Claffey K.P. Benes J.E. Perruzzi C.A. Sergiou A.P. Detmar M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13612-13617Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 16Senger D.R. Perruzzi C.A. Streit M.

MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were infected with adenovirus encoding VEGF (a generous gift of Dr. Harold F. Dvorak, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA) or control adenovirus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1,000 for 24 h. The cells (1 × 106) cells were resuspended in 0.25 ml of growth factor-reduced Matrigel (at a final concentration of 9 mg/ml) and injected subcutaneously to the midway on the right abdomen of athymic nude mice (female, 11 weeks-old). Soon after injection, animals were co-injected peritoneally with 250 μg of the α6 integrin antibody or with control antibody, each of which was administered repeatedly at an interval of 2 days. In these experiments, we used rat monoclonal antibody (clone 135-13C) for the mouse α6 integrin. Specifically, the 135-13C antibody is similar to the commercially available rat monoclonal antibody (GoH3) for mouse α6 integrin. Furthermore, this antibody inhibited the capillary morphogenesis of HBMECs onto Matrigel as well as VEGF-induced adhesion and migration. After 7 days, the animals were euthanized and dissected. Implants together with associated skin were fixed overnight in 10% paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. The tissues were cut and deparaffinized, then treated with 0.1% trypsin for 30 min to improve antigen accessibility. Subsequently, the sections were treated with H2O2 to inhibit endogenous peroxidase. After blocking the nonspecific binding to the secondary antibodies by treatment with normal goat serum, polyclonal antibodies against human von Willebrand factor (1:100, Dako Inc., Carpinteria, CA) were incubated for 2 h at room temperature. The tissues were washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Vector Laboratories) for 1 h. After washing, staining was performed using the Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories).Tumor Growth Assay—MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells (3 × 106) were injected subcutaneously into both flanks of 6-week-old female nude mice. The next day after implantation, animals (5 mice per group) were injected peritoneally with 250 μg of the α6 integrin antibody (clone 135-13C) or with control antibody, each of which was administered repeatedly at an interval of 3 days. After 10 days of implantation, tumor mass was measured with calipers at an interval of 2 days and the tumor volume (mm3) was estimated by the following formula: volume = (4/3)(π)(1/2 × smaller diameter)2(1/2 × larger diameter). The differences between the experimental groups were analyzed by the Student's t test. After 25 days, tumors were dissected from the euthanized animals, embedded in OCT compound, and immediately frozen. 6-μm sections were obtained with a cryostat microtome and fixed with cold acetone. To estimate tumor vascularization, sections of nine tumors per group were stained with 10 μg/ml mouse anti-CD31 monoclonal antibody (Abcam). Blood vessels were observed under a light microscope and counted from three random fields of ×200 magnification. The lengths of the blood vessels were measured using Scion Image Beta 4.02 software. The differences between the experimental groups were analyzed by the Mann-WhitneyU test.RESULTSVEGF Induces Integrin mRNA Expression in HBMECs—By using human cDNA arrays containing integrins, we found that VEGF significantly up-regulated the mRNA expression of α2 and α6 integrins in HBMECs. Based on RNase protection assays, we obtained similar results demonstrating that VEGF induced α2 and α6 integrin mRNA expression in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1, A and B). These results are consistent with a previous report showing that VEGF induced the expression of α2 integrin in HDMECs (15Senger D.R. Claffey K.P. Benes J.E. Perruzzi C.A. Sergiou A.P. Detmar M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13612-13617Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). We also observed that the expression of β8 integrin reached a maximal level of transcription at 3 h (2.5-fold increase compared with the control) and decreased to control levels at 12 h, while VEGF decreased β3 integrin mRNA expression in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1, B and C). Interestingly, both experiments revealed that VEGF significantly increased mRNA expression of the α6 integrin in HBMECs. To confirm these results, we performed Northern blot analysis with full-length cDNA encoding the human α6 integrin. As expected, the mRNA expression of the α6 integrin began to increase 1 h after the treatment with VEGF and reached a maximal level of transcription at 12 h (7-fold increase compared with control) (Fig. 2A).FIGURE 2Expression of α6 integrin in VEGF-stimulated HBMECs.

Here we focus on a new interaction, between AKT2 and KAT2 subunits. The assembly as AKT2/KAT2 heterotetramers is demonstrated by (i) a strong signal in two-hybrid tests with intracytoplasmic C-terminal regions, (ii) the effect of KAT2 on AKT2 subunit targeting in tobacco cells, (iii) the complete inhibition of AKT2 currents by co-expression with a dominant-negative KAT2 subunit in Xenopus oocytes, and reciprocally, and (iv) the appearance, upon co-expression of wild-type AKT2 and KAT2 subunits, of new channel functional properties that cannot be explained by the co-existence of two kinds of homotetrameric channels. In particular, the instantaneous current, characteristic of AKT2, displayed new functional features when compared with those of AKT2 homotetramers: activation by external acidification (instead of inhibition) and weak inhibition by calcium. Single channel current measurements in oocytes co-expressing AKT2 and KAT2 revealed a strong preference for incorporation of subunits into heteromultimers and a diversity of individual channels. In planta, these new channels, which may undergo specific regulations, are likely to be formed in guard cells and in the phloem, where they could participate in the control of membrane potential and potassium fluxes.

Gaymard F. Sentenac H. Chérel I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3455-3463Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) result from the assembly of four so-called α-subunits. Plant and animal Shaker α-subunits display a hydrophobic core surrounded by hydrophilic N- and C-terminal regions, both located in the cytoplasm. The hydrophobic core of Shaker α-subunits, which contributes to the transmembrane moiety of the channel, includes six transmembrane segments, named S1 to S6, with a so-called P loop between S5 and S6. P lines the outer part of the channel pore and determines its ion selectivity (3Yool A.J. Schwarz T.L. Nature. 1991; 349: 700-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 4Doyle D.A.

Positively charged residues are found in S4, allowing this part of the polypeptide to move within the membrane upon changes of the electrical field therein. Movements of this so-called voltage sensor lead to the channel conformational changes that result in channel opening or closing (5Tombola F. Pathak M.M. Isacoff E.Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5509-5513Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Animal Shaker channels (tetramers of α-subunits) bind to regulatory β-subunits. These β-subunits also assemble as tetramers (18van Huizen R. Czajkowsky D.M. Shi D. Shao Z. Li M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and bind to either the N-terminal region (19Sewing S. Roeper J. Pongs O.

Some β-subunits have been shown to change the inactivation rate of their target channel (22Rettig J. Heinemann S.H. Wunder F. Lorra C. Parcej D.N. Dolly J.O. Pongs O.

In plants, homologs of β-subunits have been found and characterized (25Tang H. Vasconcelos A.C. Berkowitz G.A. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 327-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 26Fang Z.

Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 995-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In Arabidopsis, a family comprising nine genes encodes Shaker α-subunits (28Pilot G. Pratelli R. Gaymard F. Meyer Y. Sentenac H. J. Mol. Evol. 2003; 56: 418-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). All these polypeptides share the common structure described above. The GORK and SKOR α-subunits form depolarization-activated Shaker channels displaying a strong outward rectification. The KAT1, KAT2, AKT1, AKT5, SPIK, AKT2, and AtKC1 have been shown (or are believed) to form hyperpolarization-activated Shaker channels, all displaying a strong inward rectification except AKT2 channels, which display a weak inward rectification (29Véry A.-A. Sentenac H. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2003; 54: 575-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Plant α-subunits have a long C-terminal region constituting more than half of the protein (28Pilot G. Pratelli R. Gaymard F. Meyer Y. Sentenac H. J. Mol. Evol. 2003; 56: 418-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This C-terminal region includes three remarkable domains believed to be involved in molecular interactions: (i) a putative cyclic nucleotide-binding domain, which participates in interactions between subunits within the channel tetramer (2Daram P. Urbach S. Gaymard F. Sentenac H. Chérel I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3455-3463Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 30Dreyer I. Porée F. Schneider A. Mittelstadt J. Bertl A. Sentenac H.

Bennett V. Trends Cell Biol. 1992; 2: 127-129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar); and (iii) a distal region, involved in tetramerization (2Daram P. Urbach S. Gaymard F.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 166-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). These α-subunits can generally assemble as homotetramers, but evidence has also been provided, by functional analyses in Xenopus oocytes or two-hybrid tests in yeast, for heterotetramerization. Interactions have been found between KAT1 and AKT1, KAT1 and AtKC1 (34Dreyer I. Antunes S. Hoshi T. Müller-Röber B. Palme K. Pongs O. Reintanz G. Hedrich R. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 2143-2150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), AKT2 and KAT1 (35Baizabal-Aguirre V.M. Clemens S. Uozomi N. Schroeder J.I. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 167: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), KAT1 and KAT2 (36Pilot G. Lacombe B. Gaymard F. Chérel I. Boucherez J. Thibaud J.-B. Sentenac H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3215-3221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), AKT1 and AKT2, AKT1 and AtKC1, and AKT2 and AtKC1 (37Pilot G. Gaymard F. Mouline K. Chérel I. Sentenac H. Plant Mol. Biol. 2003; 51: 773-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Heterotetramerization has been reported only between subunits of the same functional type (inward or outward). It has been shown that the C-terminal region is involved in discrimination between outward and inward channel-forming subunits (30Dreyer I. Porée F. Schneider A. Mittelstadt J. Bertl A. Sentenac H. Thibaud J.-B. Mueller-Roeber B. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 858-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), preventing formation of heteromeric structures between the two subunit types. In the case of AKT1 and KAT1, heteromer formation has been reported in oocytes (34Dreyer I. Antunes S. Hoshi T. Müller-Röber B. Palme K. Pongs O. Reintanz G. Hedrich R. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 2143-2150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and in yeast using the split ubiquitin system (38Obrdlik P. El-Bakkoury M. Hamacher T. Cappellaro C. Vilarino C. Fleischer C. Ellerbrok H. Kamuzinzi R. Ledent V. Blaudez D. Sanders D. Revuelta J.L. Boles E. Andre B. Frommer W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 12242-12247Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), but this phenomenon is not observed in two-hybrid tests and in vitro under conditions where homotetrameric associations are detected, suggesting that some discrimination can exist for the formation of stable associations (39Urbach S. Chérel I. Sentenac H. Gaymard F. Plant J. 2000; 23: 527-538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In planta, Shaker α-subunits seem to be expressed in all organs and tissues (29Véry A.-A. Sentenac H. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2003; 54: 575-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). The different genes display specific expression patterns. The expression of a given gene is restricted to a limited number of cell types but overlaps between the different patterns occur so that each tissue expresses a specific set of α-subunits (29Véry A.-A. Sentenac H. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2003; 54: 575-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Confrontation of expression pattern analyses and of interaction tests suggests numerous possibilities of interactions in plant cells, especially between inward channel-forming subunits, which display overlapping patterns in a number of cell types or tissues. In Arabidopsis root hairs, where the two Shaker genes AKT1 and AtKC1 are co-expressed at high levels, formation of AKT1/AtKC1 heteromers has been shown to occur and to result in channels with new functional properties (40Reintanz B. Szyroki A. Ivashikina N. Ache P. Godde M. Becker D. Palme K. Hedrich R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4079-4084Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The situation is, however, less clear for other sets of inward subunits and cell types. For instance, five Shaker genes encoding inward channel-forming subunits, KAT1, KAT2, AKT1, AtKC1, and AKT2, are expressed in guard cells (41Szyroki A. Ivashikina N. Dietrich P. Roelfsema M.R.G. Ache P. Reintanz B. Deeken R. Godde M. Felle H. Steinmeyer R. Palme K. Hedrich R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2917-2921Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), and only little information is available on the actual homomeric and/or heteromeric structure of the channels operating in these cells. Indeed, little is known on the actual interactions and assembly patterns of Shaker subunits underlying the voltage-dependent currents recorded in plant cells and even less is known on the gating properties of the resulting heterotetrameric channels. The attention is focused here on interactions involving AKT2, especially AKT2/KAT2 interaction. AKT2 (42Cao Y. Ward J.M. Kelly W.B. Ichida A.M. Gaber R.F. Anderson J.A. Uozumi N. Schroeder J.I.

The two genes are co-expressed in the phloem vasculature. AKT2 is expressed in phloem throughout the whole plant (44Lacombe B. Pilot G. Michard E. Gaymard F. Sentenac H. Thibaud J.-B. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 837-851PubMed Google Scholar, 46Marten I. Hoth S. Deeken R. Ache P. Ketchum K.A. Hoshi T. Hedrich R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Plant J. 2003; 36: 931-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and KAT2 is expressed in the leaf minor vein phloem (36Pilot G. Lacombe B. Gaymard F. Chérel I. Boucherez J. Thibaud J.-B. Sentenac H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3215-3221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). AKT2 and KAT2 transcripts are also co-localized in guard cells (41Szyroki A. Ivashikina N. Dietrich P. Roelfsema M.R.G. Ache P. Reintanz B. Deeken R. Godde M. Felle H. Steinmeyer R. Palme K. Hedrich R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2917-2921Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that heteromeric AKT2/KAT2 channels are actually formed, giving rise to a combination of functional features inherited from the two individual α-subunits. Moreover, evidence is provided that AKT2 and KAT2 subunits are preferentially incorporated into heterotetramers when AKT2 and KAT2 are co-expressed. Yeast Two-hybrid cDNA Library Screening—Plasmids pGBT9-KAT1 and pGBT9-KAT2 allowing, respectively, the synthesis of KAT1 and KAT2 channel C-terminal parts fused to the DNA-binding domain of GAL4 were described previously (36Pilot G.

These constructs were used to screen an Arabidopsis thaliana cDNA library prepared with the GAL4 activation domain plasmid pGAD10 (MATCHMAKER, Clontech), using for transformation the lithium acetate method, as described in Chérel et al. (48Chérel I. Michard E. Platet N. Mouline K. Alcon C. Sentenac H. Thibaud J.-B. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 1133-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Transformed cells were spread directly on minimal medium lacking histidine, leucine, and tryptophane (plating medium described in Ref. 2Daram P. Urbach S. Gaymard F. Sentenac H. Chérel I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3455-3463Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, without histidine) supplemented with 50 mm 3-aminotriazole. Positive colonies were screened for β-galactosidase activity using a filter-lift assay (49Bartel P.L. Fields S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 254: 241-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). pGAD10 plasmids were isolated from yeast colonies displaying a positive phenotype and amplified in Escherichia coli. Plasmid inserts were sequenced and compared with the GenBank™ data base by BLAST search analysis (50Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol.

Mouline K. Alcon C. Sentenac H. Thibaud J.-B. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 1133-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), yielding the (bait) construct named pGBT9-AKT2. The plasmids used for the expression of AKT2 and KAT2 C-terminal regions fused to the GAL4 activation domain (prey constructs) are the previously described plasmids pACT2-AKT2 and pACT2-KAT2 (36Pilot G.

Mouline K. Chérel I. Sentenac H. Plant Mol. Biol. 2003; 51: 773-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Binary combinations of bait/prey plasmids were incorporated into yeast by the lithium acetate procedure (51Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2895) Google Scholar). Standard methodology was used to isolate transformants and to perform quantitative assays of β-galactosidase (49Bartel P.L. Fields S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 254: 241-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). This enzymatic activity was measured by following the hydrolysis of o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside in liquid medium. GFP Imaging—AKT2 and KAT2 cDNAs were amplified by PCR and cloned into pLoc and pFunct (52Hosy E. Duby G. Very A.A. Costa A. Sentenac H. Thibaud J.B. Plant Methods. 2005; 1: 14Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) for expression of GFP 3The abbreviations used are: GFP, green fluorescent protein; DNM, dominant-negative mutant; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; WT, wild type. -tagged and untagged channel subunits, respectively. The resulting plasmids were introduced by co-transfection into tobacco mesophyll protoplasts according to Hosy et al. (52Hosy E. Duby G. Very A.A. Costa A. Sentenac H. Thibaud J.B. Plant Methods. 2005; 1: 14Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Protoplasts were visualized for GFP fluorescence under a Zeiss confocal microscope (LSM510 AX70 Zeiss, Göttingen, Germany). The excitation was obtained with a beam splitter HFT 488 nm, and the emitted radiations were selected with two filters: BP 505-530 for GFP; LP 585 for chlorophyll. Plasmids Used for Electrophysiological Measurements—All constructs were made according to standard methods (53Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and verified by sequencing. The AKT2 and KAT2 cDNAs were cloned in pGEMHE (54Liman E.R. Tytgat J. Hess P. Neuron. 1992; 9: 861-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar). The AKT2 and KAT2 cDNA dominant-negative mutant constructs (pGEMHE-AKT2-DNM and pGEMHE-KAT2-DNM) were obtained as described previously (30Dreyer I. Porée F. Schneider A. Mittelstadt J. Bertl A. Sentenac H. Thibaud J.-B. Mueller-Roeber B. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 858-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Expression in Xenopus Oocytes and Electrophysiology—In vitro transcriptions were performed using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE kit (Ambion) following the manufacturer's instructions. Xenopus oocytes were purchased from the Centre de Recherche en Biochimie Macromoléculaire (CNRS, Montpellier, France). Stage V-VI oocytes were injected with a final volume of 50 nl (50 ng) of various cRNA AKT2-KAT2 combinations using a 10-15-μm tip diameter micropipette and a pneumatic injector. Co-injections were systematically performed at an equimolar concentration ratio. Injected oocytes were then maintained at 18 °C for 3-5 days in modified ND-96 solution (2 mm KCl, 96 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2,5 mm HEPES, 2.5 mm sodium pyruvate, pH 7.5) supplemented with gentamycin sulfate (50 μg/ml). Whole-cell currents from oocytes were recorded 3-5 days after injection as described previously (55Lacombe B. Thibaud J.-B. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 166: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) using the two-microelectrode voltage clamp technique. The bath solution, containing (unless otherwise stated) 10 mm KCl, 90 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), except in the pH 6.0 experiments of Fig. 5, in which the medium was buffered with MES-NaOH (pH 6.0) was continuously perfused through the chamber. For patch clamp experiments, cell-attached patch recordings were performed on devitellinized oocytes based on methods previously described (56Lacombe B. Pilot G. Gaymard F. Sentenac H. Thibaud J.-B. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Voltagepulse protocol application, data acquisition, and data analysis were performed using pClamp software version 9.0 (Axon Instruments) and Sigmaplot software (Jandel Scientific). Control electrophysiological recordings in media supplemented with 10 mm CsCl were performed systematically, as described previously (44Lacombe B. Pilot G. Michard E. Gaymard F. Sentenac H. Thibaud J.-B. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 837-851PubMed Google Scholar), to ensure that currents recorded were generated essentially by potassium-selective channels. All experiments were performed at room temperature (20-22 °C). Detection of Interactions by Two-hybrid Tests in Yeast— Large C-terminal intracytoplasmic regions of KAT1 and KAT2 (Fig. 1A) were used as baits to screen an Arabidopsis cDNA library using the two-hybrid system in yeast. Expected outcomes of such a screening procedure were partner proteins interacting with these two subunits of Arabidopsis Shaker-like K+ channels. With both baits, two different cDNAs were isolated: KAT1 and AKT2 (not shown). Interactions between KAT1 and KAT2 (36Pilot G. Lacombe B. Gaymard F. Chérel I. Boucherez J. Thibaud J.-B. Sentenac H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3215-3221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) and between KAT1 and AKT2 (35Baizabal-Aguirre V.M. Clemens S. Uozomi N. Schroeder J.I. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 167: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) had already been reported but not between KAT2 and AKT2. This last interaction appeared interesting for two reasons: the very high level of reporter gene activation in the two-hybrid test and the known co-localization of AKT2 and KAT2 gene expression in phloem and guard cells. The interaction between AKT2 and KAT2 was further studied in a series of two-hybrid tests in which the C-terminal region of each of these two putative partners was fused either to the DNA-binding domain (i.e. as the bait, pGBT9 vector) or to the activation domain (i.e. as the prey, pACT2 vector) of the GAL4 transcription factor (Fig. 1B). In negative controls (when one of the pGBT9 or pACT2 vectors was left empty), there was no activity of the reporter gene (Fig. 1B, four upper lanes). When KAT2 was used as the bait, an interaction was observed with both KAT2 and AKT2 (fifth and sixth lanes, respectively). AKT2 as the bait also interacted with AKT2 and KAT2 (seventh and eighth lanes, respectively). The highest expression level of the reporter gene was obtained in the latter of these combinations. Driving of AKT2 to the Plasma Membrane by KAT2 Subunits in Plant Cells—When KAT2-GFP was expressed alone in tobacco protoplasts, it was targeted to the plasma membrane (Fig. 2A). In the same conditions, when expressed alone or co-expressed with untagged AKT2, AKT2-GFP remained in intracellular structures that might be identified as Golgi vesicles or aggregates (Fig. 2B). A plasma membrane localization was never observed, either in the 41 protoplasts we have scanned or in the much larger population of protoplasts we have observed under the microscope. On the contrary, co-transfection of untagged KAT2 with AKT2-GFP often resulted in a shift of part of the fluorescence to the plasma membrane (Fig. 2C), the absence of plasma membrane localization in some cells probably being due to absence of KAT2 expression. The day following transfection (24-30 h), 40-60% of the protoplasts displayed (partial) plasma membrane localization of the fluorescence. Use of Dominant-negative Mutants to Reveal Co-assembly of AKT2 and KAT2 in Xenopus Oocytes—Point mutations in the pore (P-domain) of plant Shaker subunits have been reported to yield dominant-negative mutant (DNM) subunits (35Baizabal-Aguirre V.M. Clemens S. Uozomi N. Schroeder J.I. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 167: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 57Hosy E. Vavasseur A. Mouline K. Dreyer I. Gaymard F. Porée F. Boucherez J. Lebaudy A. Bouchez D. Véry A.-A. Simonneau T. Thibaud J.-B. Sentenac H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5549-5554Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), able to inactivate the channels in which they are incorporated. In other words, co-expression of such DNM subunits with wild-type subunits results in the absence of channel activity (i.e. of exogenous current). We introduced mutations similar to those carried by the previously studied GORK-DNM subunit (35Baizabal-Aguirre V.M. Clemens S. Uozomi N. Schroeder J.I. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 167: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 57Hosy E. Vavasseur A. Mouline K. Dreyer I. Gaymard F. Porée F. Boucherez J. Lebaudy A. Bouchez D. Véry A.-A. Simonneau T.

A. 2003; 100: 5549-5554Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) in the P-domains of KAT2 and AKT2; the GYGD motif, hallmark of K+ selectivity, was mutated to RRGD. It was first checked that expression of the resulting mutant subunits produced electrically silent (or not properly targeted or unstable) channels in Xenopus oocytes (Fig. 3, KAT2-DNM and AKT2-DNM). Although control oocytes expressing only wild-type subunits displayed a large inward conductance (Fig. 3, KAT2-WT and AKT2-WT), co-expression of mutant subunits with the corresponding wild-type subunits resulted in a virtually null inward current (Fig. 3, KAT2-WT + KAT2-DNM and AKT2-WT + AKT2-DNM). Thus, the whole set of data indicated that the KAT2-DNM and AKT2-DNM subunits had indeed a dominant-negative capability, i.e. that they interacted with the wild-type polypeptide, leading to formation of channels that were n"

https://openalex.org/W2028057262,"The E6 oncoprotein of human papillomaviruses associated with cervical cancer targets the tumor suppressor p53 and several other cellular proteins including the human homologs of Dlg and Scribble for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Similar to p53 degradation, E6-induced degradation of Scribble is mediated by the ubiquitin ligase E6-AP. In contrast, degradation of Dlg in vitro and within cells has been reported to be independent of E6-AP, suggesting that the E6 oncoprotein has the ability to interact with ubiquitin ligases other than E6-AP. Furthermore, the ability of the E6 oncoprotein to interact with these yet unidentified ubiquitin ligases may be shared by the E6 protein of so-called low risk human papillomaviruses that are not associated with cervical cancer. In this study, we used the RNA interference technology and mouse embryo fibroblasts derived from E6-AP-deficient mice to obtain information about the identity of the ubiquitin ligase(s) involved in E6-mediated degradation of Dlg. We report that, within cells, E6-mediated degradation of Dlg depends on the presence of functional E6-AP and provide evidence that the E6 protein of low risk human papillomaviruses functionally interacts with E6-AP. Based on these data, we propose that, in general, the proteolytic properties of human papillomavirus E6 proteins are mediated by interaction with E6-AP.

E6-AP was originally discovered as a cellular protein that interacts with the E6 oncoprotein of so-called high risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs) and, in complex with E6, targets the tumor suppressor p53 for ubiquitination and degradation (1Huibregtse J.M.

Cancer. 2002; 2: 342-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (3148) Google Scholar). It is commonly assumed that, in the absence of E6, E6-AP is not involved in p53 degradation and that E6·E6-AP-mediated degradation of p53 contributes to HPV-induced cellular transformation. Indeed, interference with E6-AP activity in HPV-positive cells but not in HPV-negative cells results in accumulation and activation of p53 (6Beer-Romero P. Glass S. Rolfe M.

Virol. 2005; 79: 9296-9300Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Furthermore, E6 proteins derived from so-called low risk HPVs that preferentially infect mucosal epithelia but are not associated with malignant lesions only weakly interact with p53 and do not target p53 for degradation (4Scheffner M. Whitaker N.J. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2003; 13: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 10Li X. Coffino P. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4509-4516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Mantovani F. Banks L. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7874-7887Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The inability to target p53 for degradation may be explained by the notion that bacterially expressed low risk HPV E6 proteins do not form complexes with E6-AP that are detectable under the conditions of coprecipitation experiments (1Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 775-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 2Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4918-4927Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Although the ability of high risk HPV E6 proteins to target p53 for degradation contributes to their oncogenic potential, it is also clear that high risk HPV E6 proteins have oncogenic activities that are independent of p53 (summarized in Refs. 4Scheffner M. Whitaker N.J. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2003; 13: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar and 11Mantovani F. Banks L. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7874-7887Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Numerous cellular proteins have been reported to interact with high risk E6 proteins (e.g. Bak, c-Myc, E6BP/ERC55, E6TP1, IRF-3, Mcm7, Paxillin, Dlg, MAGI-1, MUPP-1, Scrib), and some of these have been reported to be targeted for degradation in an E6-AP-dependent (e.g. Bak, c-Myc, Mcm7, Scrib) or E6-AP-independent (Dlg, MAGI-1, MUPP-1) manner (4Scheffner M. Whitaker N.J. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2003; 13: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 11Mantovani F. Banks L. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7874-7887Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, some of these proteins (Mcm7, Bak) have also been reported to be targeted by E6 proteins derived from so-called low risk HPVs, including HPV6 and HPV11, that have not been associated with malignant lesions (12Kuhne C. Banks L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34302-34309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 13Thomas M. Banks L. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 1513-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 14Jackson S. Harwood C. Thomas M. Banks L. Storey A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 3065-3073Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which low risk HPV E6 proteins target these proteins for degradation is not known at present. Dlg, MAGI-1, MUPP-1, and Scrib are PDZ domain-containing proteins (11Mantovani F. Banks L. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7874-7887Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a simplified view, PDZ domains can be considered as protein-protein recognition modules that are part of molecular scaffolds that hold multisubunit protein complexes together. The high risk HPV E6 proteins, but not the low risk HPV E6 proteins, contain at their very C terminus a PDZ-binding motif, a rather short motif (X(T/S)XV) generally found in proteins that specifically interact with PDZ domains (15Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar, 16Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar). Indeed, binding of high risk HPV E6 proteins to PDZ domain-containing proteins is dependent on the presence of an intact C terminus (11Mantovani F. Banks L. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7874-7887Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Significantly with respect to oncogenesis, the very C-terminal region of E6 is not required for interaction with E6-AP and p53, but C-terminal deletion mutants of E6 are impaired in their transforming capacity (11Mantovani F. Banks L. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7874-7887Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Nguyen M.L. Nguyen M.M. Lee D. Griep A.E. Lambert P.F. J.

This indicates that the interaction with and, possibly, degradation of PDZ domain-containing proteins contribute to the oncogenic potential of E6. However, although PDZ domain-containing proteins are targeted for degradation by the high risk HPV E6 proteins, the mechanisms involved in the degradation of these proteins were reported to be different. Unlike binding to p53, binding of E6 to PDZ domain-containing proteins including Dlg and Scrib is independent of E6-AP (4Scheffner M. Whitaker N.J. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2003; 13: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 11Mantovani F. Banks L. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7874-7887Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, E6-induced degradation of Scrib proceeds via E6-AP-dependent ubiquitination (20Nakagawa S. Huibregtse J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8244-8253Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar), whereas E6-induced degradation of Dlg or MAGI-1 has been proposed to involve E3 ligases other than E6-AP (21Pim D. Thomas M. Javier R. Gardiol D. Banks L. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 719-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 22Pim D. Thomas M. Banks L. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8140-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 23Grm H.S. Banks L. J. Gen. Virol. 2004; 85: 2815-2819Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The latter notion is based mainly on the observations that, in vitro, high risk HPV E6 proteins can target Dlg for degradation in the absence of E6-AP and that low risk HPV E6 proteins, when fused to a C-terminal PDZ-binding motif, can target Dlg for proteasome-mediated degradation within cells (21Pim D. Thomas M. Javier R. Gardiol D. Banks L. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 719-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 22Pim D. Thomas M. Banks L. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8140-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 23Grm H.S. Banks L. J. Gen. Virol. 2004; 85: 2815-2819Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To confirm that E6-induced degradation of Dlg is independent of E6-AP, we set out to characterize E6-mediated degradation of Dlg and p53 in cells that are deficient for E6-AP. Unexpectedly, we observed that high risk HPV E6-mediated degradation of Dlg requires the presence of catalytically active E6-AP. Furthermore, degradation of Dlg mediated by a chimeric protein consisting of the C-terminal PDZ-binding motif of high risk HPV E6 proteins fused to a low risk HPV E6 protein was also dependent on the presence of E6-AP. This indicates that low risk HPV E6 proteins can functionally interact with E6-AP. Finally, we have provided evidence that low risk HPV E6 proteins and E6-AP can form complexes, when both proteins are coexpressed within cells. Thus, the ability to interact with E6-AP appears to be more conserved among HPV E6 proteins than previously assumed. Cell Lines and Plasmids—Mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) prepared from E6-AP knock-out mice (kindly provided by A. Beaudet, Houston, Texas) (24Jiang Y.H. Armstrong D. Albrecht U. Atkins C.M.

Bacterial expression constructs for glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins of HPV11 E6 and HPV18 E6 were described previously (1Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 775-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Bacterial expression constructs for GST fusion proteins of various HPV E6 chimeric proteins (18C11, 11C18, 5C18, 6C18, 16C18) (see Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. 2) were generated using PCR-based approaches. 3Further details will be provided upon request. For transient transfection experiments, the various E6 proteins were expressed with an N-terminal HA tag or N-terminal GFP tag from the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). GFP was expressed from pcDNA3. (Invitrogen). The expression construct for wild-type p53 was described previously (25Hengstermann A. Whitaker N.J. Zimmer D. Zentgraf H. Scheffner M.

Pique, Paris, France), and FLAG-tagged MAGI-1 (kindly provided by S. Butz, University of Muenster, Germany) were described previously (21Pim D. Thomas M. Javier R. Gardiol D. Banks L.

Transfection and Antibodies—In transient expression experiments, cells were transfected with the respective constructs in the presence of a reporter construct encoding β-galactosidase by lipofection (Lipofectamine 2000, Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein extracts were prepared 24 h after transfection as described (25Hengstermann A. Whitaker N.J. Zimmer D. Zentgraf H. Scheffner M. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2933-2941Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and transfection efficiency was determined by measuring β-galactosidase activity. Levels of p53, HA-tagged Dlg (rat or human; note that similar results were obtained for rat and human Dlg in all the experiments performed), FLAG-tagged MAGI-1, E6-AP and its mutant forms, the various HA-tagged E6 proteins, and GFP were determined by Western blot analysis using transfection efficiency-adjusted protein amounts. The antibodies used for detection were: mouse monoclonal HA.11 (Hiss Diagnostics, Freiburg, Germany) for HA-tagged proteins, mouse monoclonal M2 (Sigma) for FLAG-tagged proteins, mouse monoclonal DO1 for p53 (Calbiochem), a mixture of mouse monoclonal antibodies 7.1 and 13.1 for GFP (Roche Applied Science), a mouse monoclonal antibody for tubulin (kindly provided by A. A. Noegel, Koeln, Germany), and a mouse monoclonal antibody for E6-AP (9Hengstermann A. D'silva M.A. Kuballa P. Butz K. Hoppe-Seyler F. Scheffner M. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 9296-9300Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Endogenous Dlg and E6-AP present in protein extracts prepared from HeLa cells were detected by mouse monoclonal antibody 2D11 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and a mouse monoclonal antibody for E6-AP (9Hengstermann A. D'silva M.A. Kuballa P. Butz K. Hoppe-Seyler F. Scheffner M. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 9296-9300Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), respectively. To generate cell lines in which E6-AP expression is stably suppressed by RNA interference, H1299 cells were transfected with pRetroSUPER-E6-AP expressing an siRNA directed against nucleotides 300–318 of the E6-AP mRNA (numbering according to E6-AP isoform 1, with nucleotide 1 referring to A of the start codon) by lipofection (Lipofectamine 2000, Invitrogen). Cells stably containing the expression construct were selected by resistance to puromycin (Sigma). After single cell clones were established, protein extracts were prepared (25Hengstermann A. Whitaker N.J. Zimmer D. Zentgraf H. Scheffner M. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2933-2941Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and E6-AP levels determined by Western blot using a mouse monoclonal antibody (9Hengstermann A. D'silva M.A. Kuballa P. Butz K. Hoppe-Seyler F. Scheffner M. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 9296-9300Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). siRNAs against mRNAs encoding E6-AP, HPV-18 E6, or Renilla luciferase were obtained from MWG (Ebersbach, Germany). The respective sequences used were described previously (9Hengstermann A. D'silva M.A. Kuballa P. Butz K. Hoppe-Seyler F. Scheffner M. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 9296-9300Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 29Butz K. Ristriani T. Hengstermann A. Denk C. Scheffner M. Hoppe-Seyler F. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 5938-5945Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). For siRNA-mediated knockdown of the respective mRNAs, exponentially growing cells were transfected with 0.6 nmol of the respective siRNA per 6-cm plate by Oligofectamine according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Protein extracts were prepared 72 h after transfection and the levels of endogenous E6-AP and Dlg detected by Western blot analysis. Ubiquitination and Coprecipitation Assays—For in vitro ubiquitination experiments, the various E6 proteins were expressed as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins in Escherichia coli DH5α. The ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1, E6-AP, and the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UbcH5 were expressed in the baculovirus system or in E. coli BL21 by using the pET expression system as described (30Nuber U. Schwarz S. Kaiser P. Schneider R. Scheffner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2795-2800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). For in vitro ubiquitination, 1 μl of wheat germ extract-translated 35S-labeled substrate (p53, rat Dlg, or human Dlg) was incubated with 50 ng of E1, 50 ng of UbcH5, and 10 μg of ubiquitin (Sigma) in the absence or presence of bacterially expressed E6 (50 ng) and baculovirus-expressed E6-AP (50 ng) in 50-μl volumes. In addition, reactions contained 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 60 mm NaCl, 3 mm dithiothreitol, 2–4 mm ATP, and 4–8 mm MgCl2. After incubation at 30 °C for 2 h, total reaction mixtures were electrophoresed in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and the 35S-labeled substrates were detected by fluorography. For coprecipitation experiments, two 10-cm plates of HEK293 cells were transfected with the respective expression constructs for HA-tagged HPV E6 proteins and the various forms of E6-AP (see Fig. 6). Protein extracts were prepared 24 h after transfection and precleared with protein A-Sepharose. Then, 4 μg of the mouse monoclonal antibody HA.11 was added, the extracts were incubated for 4 h at 4°C, and bound proteins were precipitated by protein A-Sepharose. 10% of the precipitate were used for Western blot analysis to detect the respective E6 protein and potentially coprecipitated E6-AP. With the remaining 90% of the precipitate, in vitro ubiquitination assays in the presence of 50 ng of E1, 50 ng of UbcH5, and 10 μg of ubiquitin were performed under standard reaction conditions (see above). E6-AP Mediates High Risk HPV E6-induced Ubiquitination of Dlg in Vitro—It was previously reported that high risk HPV E6 proteins induce degradation of wheat germ extract translated Dlg in vitro (23Grm H.S. Banks L. J. Gen. Virol. 2004; 85: 2815-2819Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Since wheat germ extract does not contain E6-AP (1Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 775-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 2Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4918-4927Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), this indicated that E6-induced degradation of Dlg does not require the presence of E6-AP. However, no experimental evidence was provided to show that E6-induced degradation of Dlg in vitro requires ubiquitination of Dlg. In an effort to set up an E6-dependent in vitro ubiquitination system for Dlg, we observed that, in the presence of E6-AP, HPV18 E6 (Fig. 1) or HPV16 E6 (data not shown) is capable of inducing the ubiquitination of in wheat germ extract translated radioactively labeled Dlg. 4Note that in this and all subsequent experiments, similar results were obtained for rat and human Dlg. Thus, no distinction will be made between rat and human Dlg. Furthermore, E6-mediated ubiquitination of Dlg was dependent on the presence of the C-terminal PDZ-binding motif of E6 indicating the specificity of this reaction. Thus, at least in vitro, E6-AP can support E6-induced ubiquitination of Dlg. These data are consistent with results recently published by Matsumoto et al. (31Matsumoto Y. Nakagawa S. Yano T. Takizawa S. Nagasaka K. Nakagawa K. Minaguchi T. Wada O. Ooishi H. Matsumoto K. Yasugi T. Kanda T. Huibregtse J.M. Taketani Y. J. Med. Virol. 2006; 78: 501-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). A fusion protein consisting of the C-terminal PDZ-binding motif of HPV18 E6 fused to HPV11 E6 was reported to induce degradation of Dlg in vitro and within cells (22Pim D. Thomas M. Banks L. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8140-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Thus, we generated bacterial and mammalian expression constructs encoding a similar fusion protein (Fig. 1A, 11C18). However, although the 11C18 E6 protein was able to bind to Dlg in vitro (data not shown) and to target Dlg for degradation within cells (see below), bacterially expressed 11C18 was not able to induce ubiquitination of Dlg in vitro under the conditions used, neither in the absence (not shown) nor the presence of E6-AP (Fig. 1). The following data were obtained with HPV18 E6 and HPV11 E6. However, we will refer to “high risk” (HPV18) and “low risk” (HPV11) HPV E6 proteins rather than to HPV18 E6 and HPV11 E6, since similar data were obtained for the E6 proteins derived from HPV16 (high risk) and HPV6 (low risk). E6-AP Is Required for E6-mediated Degradation of Dlg in Murine Cells—To address the role of E6-AP in E6-facilitated degradation of Dlg within cells, MEFs were prepared from genetically engineered E6-AP null mice (24Jiang Y.H. Armstrong D. Albrecht U. Atkins C.M. Noebels J.L. Eichele G. Sweatt J.D. Beaudet A.L. Neuron. 1998; 21: 799-811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar), and the ability of E6 to target Dlg and p53, respectively, for degradation was determined in cotransfection assays. As expected, high risk HPV E6 proteins but not low risk HPV E6 proteins induced degradation of p53 in the presence of ectopically expressed wild-type E6-AP (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, the disappearance of p53 was not observed in the presence of an E6-AP mutant devoid of the E6 binding site (E6-AP-ΔE6bs) (2Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4918-4927Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) or of a catalytically inactive E6-AP mutant (E6-AP-C820A) (32Scheffner M. Nuber U. Huibregtse J.M. Nature. 1995; 373: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar), indicating that E6-AP null MEFs are suited to address the role of E6-AP in the degradation of a given protein. Similar to the results obtained in the in vitro ubiquitination system, high risk HPV E6-induced degradation of Dlg was dependent on the presence of wild-type E6-AP and the presence of the C-terminal PDZ-binding motif of E6 (Fig. 2B, 18C11). Furthermore, the 11C18 protein was capable of inducing degradation of Dlg but, surprisingly, only in the presence of wild-type E6-AP. Although it is not possible to conclude from these data that E6-AP is directly involved in low risk HPV E6-induced degradation of Dlg, the finding that degradation of Dlg is not observed in the presence of E6-AP-ΔE6bs is consistent with this possibility. E6-AP Is Required for E6-mediated Degradation of Dlg in Human Cells—Although the experiments with E6-AP null MEFs showed that E6-AP is required for E6-induced degradation of Dlg within murine cells, it remained unclear whether this result can be extrapolated to human cells. For example, it could be envisioned that human cells, but not murine cells, express an E3 ligase that interacts with both low risk and high risk HPV E6 proteins and that this E3 ligase can substitute for E6-AP in the degradation of Dlg. Human cell lines deficient in E6-AP expression have not yet been described. To generate cells that express no or at least significantly decreased levels of E6-AP, the H1299 cell line was used, because this cell line is readily transfectable and proficient in E6-induced degradation of both p53 and Dlg (Fig. 3A). H1299 cells were transfected with pRetroSUPER-E6-AP, which should allow the stable suppression of E6-AP expression by RNA interference (33Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3971) Google Scholar). Upon selection, single cell clones were established, and the individual clones were checked for E6-AP expression by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 3B, some of the selected clones had E6-AP levels similar to the parental H1299 cells, whereas in other clones (i.e. K2 and K3) E6-AP expression was significantly decreased, suggesting that E6-AP-specific siRNAs are expressed at different levels in the individual cell clones. Furthermore, upon cotransfection, neither high risk HPV E6 proteins nor 11C18 was able to induce degradation of p53 and Dlg in the K3 or the K2 clone (Fig. 3C, and data not shown). The above data indicate that, with respect to E6-induced degradation of p53 and Dlg, the clones K2 and K3 can be considered as “E6-AP null” cells. To unambiguously demonstrate that the inability of K2 and K3 cells to support E6-mediated degradation processes is indeed due to insufficient expression levels of E6-AP, rescue experiments were performed. To do so, expression constructs for E6-AP and its mutants were generated that were resistant to the siRNA used to abrogate expression of endogenous E6-AP by introducing silent mutations in the region of the E6-AP mRNA targeted by the siRNA (supplemental Fig. 1). Indeed, coexpression of the respective wild-type E6-AP expression construct resulted in efficient E6-facilitated degradation of p53 and Dlg, respectively (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, the requirements for E6-AP to support degradation of Dlg were similar for both high risk HPV E6 proteins and 11C18, insofar as the region of E6-AP that mediates the interaction with high risk HPV E6 proteins is also required for 11C18-induced degradation of Dlg. Similar to Dlg, E6-induced degradation of MAGI-1 has been reported to be independent of E6-AP (23Grm H.S. Banks L. J. Gen. Virol. 2004; 85: 2815-2819Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Thus, we determined the ability of E6 to induce degradation of MAGI-1 in parental H1299 cells (data not shown) and K3 cells (Fig. 4B). As for Dlg, E6-induced degradation of MAGI-1 was observed only upon coexpression of wild-type E6-AP indicating that, in general, E6-induced degradation of PDZ domain-containing proteins is mediated by E6-AP. Down-regulation of E6-AP Expression Induces Dlg Accumulation in HeLa Cells—We have recently reported that down-regulation of E6-AP expression by RNA interference results in accumulation of p53 and induction of apoptosis in HPV18-positive HeLa cells and other HPV-positive cell lines (9Hengstermann A. D'silva M.A. Kuballa P. Butz K. Hoppe-Seyler F. Scheffner M. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 9296-9300Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In contrast, the cytotoxic effect of down-regulation of E6-AP expression was significantly diminished in HeLa cells, in which p53 expression was stably suppressed by RNA interference (“p53 null” HeLa cells). If E6-AP is involved in E6-facilitated degradation of Dlg in HPV-positive cell lines, abrogation of the ubiquitin ligase activity of E6-AP should result in accumulation of endogenous Dlg. Indeed, transient down-regulation of E6-AP by RNA interference resulted in a moderate but significant increase in Dlg levels in p53 null HeLa cells (Fig. 5). Furthermore, the relative increase in Dlg levels was similar to that observed upon down-regulation of expression of the endogenous E6 protein, whereas Dlg levels were not affected by down-regulation of E6-AP expression in HPV-negative H1299 cells (see Fig. 3B). Thus, E6-AP appears to be involved intrinsically in E6-mediated degradation of Dlg in HeLa cells but does not play a role in the degradation of Dlg in HPV-negative cells, consistent with the observation that E6-AP does not bind to Dlg in the absence of E6. Low risk HPV E6 Proteins Can Bind to E6-AP—The results presented above indicate that within cells, low risk HPV E6 proteins have the ability to functionally interact with E6-AP. To obtain evidence that E6-AP functions as an ubiquitin ligase in low risk HPV E6-mediated degradation of Dlg, we revisited the possibility that low risk HPV E6 proteins form complexes with E6-AP. As reported previously (1Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 775-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 2Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4918-4927Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), and in line with the in vitro ubiquitination data presented above, an interaction between bacterially expressed low risk HPV E6 proteins and in vitro translated E6-AP was not observed (data not shown). However, when both proteins were coexpressed in mammalian cells, E6-AP was coprecipitated with low risk HPV E6 (Fig. 6A). Importantly, binding of 11C18 E6 to E6-AP required the region of E6-AP that was previously shown to be necessary and sufficient for interaction with high risk HPV E6 proteins (2Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4918-4927Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the precipitated complex was able to induce in vitro ubiquitination of Dlg but not of p53, indicating the specificity of the in vitro reaction (Fig. 6B). Similar to the findings of a previous report (22Pim D. Thomas M. Banks L. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8140-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), however, a chimeric protein consisting of the C-terminal PDZ-binding motif of HPV18 E6 fused to the E6 protein of a cutaneous HPV type (HPV5, which has not been associated with mucosal lesions) did not coprecipitate with E6-AP and did not induce either ubiquitination of Dlg in vitro (Fig. 6) or degradation of Dlg within cells (supplemental Fig. 2). This indicates that the ability to interact with E6-AP is conserved among the E6 proteins derived from mucosal HPVs but not among HPV E6 proteins in general. Using in vitro ubiquitination assays and cellular degradation assays, we provide evidence that the ability of high risk HPV E6 proteins to utilize the cellular ubiquitin ligase E6-AP to target associated proteins for ubiquitination and degradation is shared by the low risk HPV E6 proteins. Furthermore, based on the results obtained with E6-AP null MEFs and H1299 cells, in which expression of endogenous E6-AP was ablated by RNA interference, we conclude that, in contrast to previous assumptions (21Pim D. Thomas M. Javier R. Gardiol D. Banks L. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 719-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 22Pim D. Thomas M. Banks L. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8140-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 23Grm H.S. Banks L. J. Gen. Virol. 2004; 85: 2815-2819Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), E6-AP is required for E6-mediated degradation of the PDZ domain-containing proteins Dlg and MAGI-1. It was reported previously that, in vitro, E6 targets Dlg for proteasome-mediated degradation in an E6-AP-independent manner (23Grm H.S. Banks L. J. Gen. Virol. 2004; 85: 2815-2819Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, no evidence was provided to indicate that this E6-mediated degradation process requires prior ubiquitination of Dlg. Given that our results show that within cells E6-mediated degradation of both Dlg and MAGI-1 is dependent on the presence of E6-AP, we do not favor the hypothesis that another ligase may substitute for E6-AP in the in vitro system. Several proteins including c-Jun and c-Fos have been reported to be degraded by the proteasome in a ubiquitin-dependent and ubiquitin-independent manner (34Jariel-Encontre I. Pariat M. Martin F. Carillo S. Salvat C. Piechaczyk M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11623-11627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 35Bossis G. Ferrara P. Acquaviva C. Jariel-Encontre I. Piechaczyk M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7425-7436Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Thus, an interesting but purely speculative possibility is that, in vitro,E6 can target PDZ domain-containing proteins to the proteasome in a ubiquitin-independent and thus E6-AP-independent manner. Reconstitution experiments in H1299 cells, in which expression of endogenous E6-AP was stably ablated by RNA interference, showed that wild-type E6-AP is required for E6-induced degradation of p53 and Dlg (Fig. 4). Accordingly, expression of mutant forms of E6-AP that either are not capable of binding to E6 or are catalytically inactive did not rescue E6-mediated proteolytic processes. These results demonstrate that the RNA interference technology can be used to perform structure/function analyses of a given protein within cells, thereby providing an excellent tool to correlate known biochemical properties of a protein with physiological functions. Furthermore, the results indicate that E6-induced degradation of Dlg involves ubiquitination of Dlg. It should be noted, however, that attempts to accumulate ubiquitinated forms of Dlg by the addition of proteasome inhibitors to transfected cells failed. This is probably explained by the observation that proteasome inhibitors only marginally interfered with E6-induced degradation of Dlg under the conditions used (data not shown). (The possibility that the disappearance of Dlg in the presence of E6 is due to nonproteolytic events was excluded by the use of the ubiquitin fusion protein system developed by the Varshavsky laboratory (36Varshavsky A. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 399: 777-799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); see supplemental Fig. 3.) In comparison with nontransfected cells, transfected cells appear to be more sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of proteasome inhibitors. Thus, to exclude possible artifacts, transfected cells were treated with proteasome inhibitors for only a limited amount of time (4 h). Because only marginal increases of Dlg were observed under these conditions, we propose that, even in the presence of E6, Dlg has a half-life of more than 4–6 h. In agreement with this hypothesis, HeLa cells had to be treated for 8–10 h with proteasome inhibitors before a 2-fold increase in endogenous Dlg levels was observed (data not shown), although Dlg was at least partially degraded via the E6·E6-AP complex in these cells (Fig. 5). Although our data clearly show that low risk HPV E6 proteins have the ability to interact with E6-AP, the physiological significance of this interaction remains to be established. To do so, it will be important to identify the interaction partners of low risk HPV E6 proteins and to determine whether their stability is affected by the E6 proteins in an E6-AP-dependent manner. Previous studies have shown that the E6 proteins of both low risk and high risk HPVs have the ability to target Bak for degradation (13Thomas M. Banks L. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 1513-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 14Jackson S. Harwood C. Thomas M. Banks L. Storey A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 3065-3073Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). For unknown reasons, we have not been able to observe E6-mediated degradation of ectopically expressed Bak in cotransfection experiments. In this context, it should be noted that our results do not exclude the possibility that the E6 proteins of low risk and/or high risk HPVs have the ability to interact functionally with other, as yet unidentified, ubiquitin ligases in the degradation of proteins other than p53 and PDZ domain-containing proteins. In agreement with previous reports, we were not able to observe complex formation between bacterially expressed low risk HPV E6 proteins and in vitro translated E6-AP or E6-AP present in mammalian cell extracts and vice versa (1Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 775-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 2Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4918-4927Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). However, coexpression of both proteins within cells resulted in the formation of a complex containing low risk HPV E6 proteins and E6-AP. Importantly, complex formation required the region of E6-AP that also mediates the interaction of E6-AP with high risk HPV E6 proteins. Furthermore, catalytically active E6-AP is required for 11C18 E6 to target Dlg for ubiquitination in vitro and for degradation within cells. Taken together, these data indicate that low risk HPV E6 proteins directly interact with E6-AP and that the low risk HPV E6·E6-AP complex functions as a ubiquitin ligase. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that an additional, as yet unknown, ubiquitin ligase contributes to E6·E6-AP-mediated ubiquitination/degradation of Dlg. Similarly, it is possible that additional yet unknown proteins are required to facilitate the interaction of E6-AP with low risk HPV E6 proteins (e.g. by posttranslational modification of E6, E6-AP, or both or by affecting the structure of E6 or E6-AP). Mass spectrometric analyses of purified low risk HPV E6·E6-AP complexes should provide insight into the composition of this complex and provide the initial hints to answer these questions.

https://openalex.org/W2035603040,"In yeast the homologous transcription factors Stp1 and Stp2 are synthesized as latent cytoplasmic precursors with N-terminal regulatory domains. In response to extracellular amino acids the regulatory domains are endoproteolytically excised by the plasma membrane-localized SPS sensor. The processed forms of Stp1 and Stp2 efficiently enter the nucleus and induce expression of amino acid permease genes. We recently reported that the inner nuclear membrane protein Asi1 is required to prevent unprocessed forms of Stp1 and Stp2, which ectopically enter the nucleus, from binding SPS sensor-regulated promoters. Here we show that Asi3, an Asi1 homolog, and Asi2 are integral proteins of the inner nuclear membrane that function in concert with Asi1. In cells lacking any of the three Asi proteins, unprocessed full-length forms of Stp1 and Stp2 constitutively induce SPS sensor-regulated genes. Our results demonstrate that the Asi proteins ensure the fidelity of SPS sensor signaling by maintaining the dormant, or repressed state, of gene expression in the absence of inducing signals.

This study documents additional components of a novel mechanism controlling transcription in eukaryotic cells. In eukaryotes the nucleoplasm and cytoplasm are separated by the nuclear envelope. The nuclear envelope consists of two closely aligned bilayers, the inner and outer membranes, each with a unique set of resident proteins. The two nuclear membranes are joined at nuclear pore complexes, which function as channels that provide selective entry and exit routes across the nuclear envelope. Aside from rather detailed knowledge regarding the structure of nuclear pores, there is markedly little known regarding non-pore nuclear proteins (1Hetzer M. Walther T.C. Mattaj I.W. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 347-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). However, accumulating data indicate that nuclear envelope proteins participate in a variety of important processes including maintenance of nuclear architecture, chromatin organization, signaling, and gene expression (1Hetzer M. Walther T.C. Mattaj I.W. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 347-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 2Schirmer E.C. Gerace L. Trends Biochem.

Genet. 2004; 38: 305-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Significantly, mutations in genes encoding nuclear envelope proteins are linked to at least 15 inherited human diseases and syndromes (4Somech R. Shaklai S. Amariglio N. Rechavi G. Simon A.J. Pediatr. Res. 2005; 57: 8R-15RCrossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 5Muchir A. Worman H.J. Physiology (Bethesda). 2004; 19: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, nuclear lamins are involved in an extensive network of protein-protein interactions, including inner nuclear membrane proteins and transcriptional regulators, some of which bind DNA (3Taddei A. Hediger F. Neumann F.R. Gasser S.M. Annu Rev. Genet. 2004; 38: 305-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 6Gruenbaum Y. Margalit A. Goldman R.D. Shumaker D.K. Wilson K.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 21-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). Although yeast cells lack lamin homologs (7Cardenas M.E. Laroche T. Gasser S.M. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 96: 439-450PubMed Google Scholar), processes associated with the inner nuclear membrane have been shown to influence patterns of gene expression. For example, although silencing is not obligatorily linked to perinuclear anchoring (8Gartenberg M.R. Neumann F.R. Laroche T. Blaszczyk M. Gasser S.M. Cell. 2004; 119: 955-967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), recruitment of chromatin to the nuclear periphery can facilitate gene repression (9Andrulis E.D. Zappulla D.C. Ansari A. Perrod S. Laiosa C.V. Gartenberg M.R. Sternglanz R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8292-8301Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Evidence obtained using genome-wide approaches suggest that transcriptionally active regions of chromosomes localize to nuclear pore complexes (10Casolari J.M. Brown C.R. Drubin D.A. Rando O.J. Silver P.A. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1188-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 11Casolari J.M. Brown C.R. Komili S. West J. Hieronymus H. Silver P.A. Cell. 2004; 117: 427-439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Consistently, a number of actively expressed genes have been found to interact with the nucleoporin Nup2; the interactions occur at the promoter region of genes and appear to correlate with early events of gene expression (12Schmid M. Arib G. Laemmli C. Nishikawa J. Durussel T. Laemmli U.K. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 379-391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 13Ishii K. Arib G. Lin C. Van Houwe G. Laemmli U.K. Cell. 2002; 109: 551-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Together findings in yeast and metazoan cells suggest that the nuclear envelope, and in particular the inner nuclear membrane, is not only a physical barrier that restricts the movement of macromolecules between the cyto- and nucleoplasm, but functions as a scaffold for proteins required for diverse nuclear functions. Several transcription factors in eukaryotic cells are synthesized as latent precursor forms that are excluded from the nucleus until proper environmental cues activate processes that trigger their targeting and entry into the nucleus (14Brivanlou A.H. Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 2002; 295: 813-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Examples of latent transcription factors include the well studied NFκB/Relish, Cubitus interruptus (Ci), and Notch proteins (15Aza-Blanc P. Kornberg T.B. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 458-462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 16Baron M. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 14: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 17Gilmore T.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6842-6844Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). The signals that activate and induce the translocation of these factors into the nucleus are initiated by receptors at the plasma membrane. Thus, the mobilization of activated transcription factors physically transmits signals from non-nuclear compartments to specific promoter sequences of responsive genes. To fully understand how latent factors are controlled, it is crucial to dissect the mechanisms that restrict their activity under non-inducing conditions. Physically anchoring the latent precursor forms outside the nucleus appears to be a versatile mechanism to prevent nuclear import prior to activation. Illustrative examples of this type of negative regulation include the anchoring of the sterol regulatory element-binding protein in membranes of the early secretory pathway (18Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2980) Google Scholar), and the sequestration of NFκB by the actin cytoskeleton-binding protein IFκB (14Brivanlou A.H. Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 2002; 295: 813-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 17Gilmore T.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6842-6844Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). With respect to non-membrane factors like NFκB, little is known regarding the efficiency of cytoplasmic retention mechanisms. Given the nature and kinetics of protein-protein interactions, retention of soluble latent transcription factors is likely to be incomplete even under non-inducing conditions. Consequently, we anticipate that cells do not merely rely on cytoplasmic retention mechanisms, but possess additional backup systems to maintain the stringency of the inactive state under non-inducing conditions. In response to extracellular amino acids, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae induces the expression of a number of amino acid permeases (AAPs) 3The abbreviations used are: AAP, amino acid permease; SPS, Ssy1-Ptr3-Ssy5; SD, synthetic minimal dextrose; SC, synthetic complex dextrose; AzC, azetidine carboxylate; MM, 2-{[({[(4-methoxy-6-methyl)-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl]-amino}carbonyl)amino]sulfonyl}-benzoic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; endo-H, endoglycosidase H; HA, hemagglutinin; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; SLS, sodium N-lauroyl sarcosinate; GST, glutathione S-transferase; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; WT, wild type. 3The abbreviations used are: AAP, amino acid permease; SPS, Ssy1-Ptr3-Ssy5; SD, synthetic minimal dextrose; SC, synthetic complex dextrose; AzC, azetidine carboxylate; MM, 2-{[({[(4-methoxy-6-methyl)-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl]-amino}carbonyl)amino]sulfonyl}-benzoic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; endo-H, endoglycosidase H; HA, hemagglutinin; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; SLS, sodium N-lauroyl sarcosinate; GST, glutathione S-transferase; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; WT, wild type. that collectively control the influx of amino acids across the plasma membrane (19Forsberg H. Ljungdahl P.O. Curr. Genet. 2001; 40: 91-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Induction of AAP gene expression requires the plasma membrane-localized Ssy1-Ptr3-Ssy5 (SPS) sensor (20Forsberg H. Ljungdahl P.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 814-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The SPS sensor controls the activity of two homologous zinc finger transcription factors Stp1 and Stp2, which are synthesized as latent cytoplasmic factors (21Andréasson C. Ljungdahl P.O. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 3158-3172Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Upon induction by amino acids, Stp1 and Stp2 are cleaved by the endoprotease Ssy5, a core component of the SPS sensor (22Abdel-Sater F. El Bakkoury M. Urrestarazu A. Vissers S. André B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9771-9785Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 23Andréasson C. Heessen S. Ljungdahl P.O. Genes Dev. 2006; 20Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This liberates the DNA binding and transactivation domains from an ∼10-kDa N-terminal regulatory fragment. The shorter forms of Stp1 and Stp2 accumulate in the nucleus and bind to specific upstream activating sequences (UASaa) within SPS sensor-regulated promoters (24de Boer M. Nielsen P.S. Bebelman J.P. Heerikhuizen H. Andersen H.A. Planta R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 974-981Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Nielsen P.S. van den Hazel B. Didion T. de Boer M. Jørgensen M. Planta R.J. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Andersen H.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2001; 264: 613-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To identify regulatory components required to maintain the latent properties of unprocessed Stp1 and Stp2 we isolated recessive mutations in amino acid sensor independent genes that constitutively activate target promoters in the absence of a functional SPS sensor (26Forsberg H. Hammar M. Andréasson C. Moliner A. Ljungdahl P.O. Genetics. 2001; 158: 973-988PubMed Google Scholar). We recently reported that ASI1 encodes an integral polytopic component of the inner nuclear membrane (27Boban M. Zargari A. Andréasson C. Heessen S. Thyberg J. Ljungdahl P.O. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 695-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The constitutive expression of SPS sensor-regulated genes in asi1Δ mutants was traced to the ability of full-length unprocessed forms of Stp1 and Stp2 to enter the nucleus, bind promoters, and induce transcription. Promoter binding of unprocessed forms of Stp1 and Stp2 was not detected in wild-type cells. These findings provided evidence of the involvement of inner nuclear membrane proteins in an unanticipated mechanism of transcriptional control. Here we report that ASI2 and ASI3 also encode integral components of the inner nuclear membrane. Our results indicate that Asi2 and Asi3 function together with Asi1 to prevent the unprocessed forms of Stp1 and Stp2 that escape cytoplasmic retention mechanisms from inducing SPS sensor-controlled gene expression. These findings demonstrate that the Asi proteins ensure the fidelity of SPS sensor signaling by maintaining the dormant, or repressed state of gene expression in the absence of inducing signals. Media, Strains, and Plasmids—Standard media including YPD and ammonia-based synthetic minimal dextrose (SD), supplemented as required to enable growth of auxotrophic strains, were prepared as described (28Burke D. Dawson D. Stearns T. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000Google Scholar). Ammonia-based synthetic complex dextrose (SC) was prepared as described (21Andréasson C. Ljungdahl P.O. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 3158-3172Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Where indicated, l-leucine was added at a concentration of 1.3 mm to induce the SPS sensor. When required 5-fluoroortic acid (1 g/liter) was added to SC. Media were made solid with 2% (w/v) BactoAgar (Difco). Antibiotic selections were made on solid YPD supplemented with 200 mg/liter G418 (Invitrogen), 100 mg/liter clonNAT (Werner Bioagents, Jena, Germany), or 300 mg/liter hygromycin B (Duchefa, Haarlem, Netherlands). Sensitivity to 1 mm l-azetidine-2-carboxylic acid (AzC) was tested on SD supplemented with l-leucine (1.3 mm) and l-glutamic acid (1 mm). Sensitivity to 2-{[({[(4-methoxy-6-methyl)-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl]-amino}carbonyl)amino]sulfonyl}-benzoic acid (MM) was tested on YPD at a concentration of 500 mg/liter (29Jørgensen M.U. Bruun M.B.

After separation of RNA on a denaturing agarose gel, RNA was transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond-N+; Amersham Biosciences). Digoxigenin-labeled probes, specific for 339-bp AGP1 fragment (20Forsberg H. Ljungdahl P.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 814-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and 1.65-kb ACT1 fragment (31Klasson H. Fink G.R. Ljungdahl P.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5405-5416Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) were generated by PCR. Probes were hybridized and blots were developed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche). Results were quantified using an LAS1000 system (Fuji Photo Film Co. Ltd.). β-Galactosidase Activity Assay—β-Galactosidase activity was determined with N-lauroylsarcosine-permeabilized cells (32Kippert F. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 128: 201-206PubMed Google Scholar). Cells grown in SD were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in Z buffer, and the A600 was measured. A 250-μl aliquot of cell suspension was mixed with 550 μl of 0.3% (w/v) sodium N-lauroylsarcosine Z-buffer and incubated at 30 °C for 15 min. A 160-μl aliquot of 2-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside solution (4 mg/ml) was added and tubes were mixed by vortexing. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 400 μl of 1 m Na2CO3, the tubes were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 5 min, and the absorbance of the supernatant measured at 420 nm. Activity was calculated according to formula: 103 × A420/A600/0.25 (volume of cell suspension added)/time (min). Stp1 and Stp2 Processing—Cells were grown in amino acidfree SD medium to an A600 of 0.8-1.0, cultures were split, and cells were harvested 30 min after the addition of an aliquot of l-leucine (final concentration 1.3 mm) or water. Extracts were prepared from 1 ml of cell cultures according to Ref. 33Silve S. Volland C. Garnier C. Jund R. Chevallier M.R. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1114-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar. Extracted proteins were resolved on 10% acrylamide gel using SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting. Immunoblots were incubated with primary antibody (12CA5 ascites fluid; anti-HA monoclonal) diluted 1:1000 in blocking buffer (PBS, pH 7.4, 0.1% Tween 20, 5%, w/v, low fat milk powder). Immunoreactive bands were visualized by chemiluminescence detection (SuperSignal ® West Dura Substrate; Pierce) of horseradish peroxidase conjugated to a secondary antibody (anti-mouse Ig from sheep, and anti-rabbit Ig from donkey; Amersham Biosciences), and quantified by using the LAS1000 system (Fuji Photo Film Co. Ltd.). Determination of Glycosylation Status and Membrane Topology—Whole cell extracts derived from 1 ml of cultures (A600 of 1) were prepared (33Silve S. Volland C. Garnier C. Jund R. Chevallier M.R. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1114-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Duplicate protein samples (25 μl, equivalent to A600 of 0.2 cell suspension) were diluted with an equal volume of 100 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.5, and heated for 10 min at 37 °C. Three milliunits of endoglycosidase H (endo-H) (Roche) were added to half of the samples, and all samples were incubated overnight at 37 °C (34Gilstring C.F. Ljungdahl P.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31488-31495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Proteins were resolved by 7% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with monoclonal anti-HA antibody (12CA5). Microscopy—Cells were grown to an A600 of 0.8 and processed for indirect immunofluorescence analysis essentially as described in Ref. 28Burke D. Dawson D. Stearns T. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000Google Scholar. Cells were fixed by the addition of an aliquot of 37% formaldehyde directly to the cultures to a final concentration of 4.5%, and incubated 45 min at 30 °C. To detect HA- and myc-tagged proteins, the 12CA5 and 9E10 monoclonal antibodies diluted 1:300 were used, respectively. The secondary antibody was Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated to goat anti-mouse (H + L; Molecular Probes), diluted 1:500. Cells were viewed using a Zeiss Axiophot microscope with a Plan-Apochromat ×63/1.40 objective. Digital images of cells were examined using Nomarski optics, and antibody dependent and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole fluoresence (standard filter sets), were captured using a C4742-95 CCD camera (Hamamatsu Photonics, Japan) and QED Imaging software (Media Cybernetics). Image files were incorporated into figures using Photoshop CS (Adobe Systems, Inc.). Immunoelectron Microscopy—Cells were grown to A600 of 0.7 and fixed in 2% formaldehyde, 0.1% glutaraldehyde at 30 °C for 1 h with gentle shaking. The fixed cells were washed in SP buffer (1.2 m sorbitol, 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.5), pelleted by centrifugation, dehydrated in graded ethanol (70-100%), and embedded in LR White Resin (London Resin) by UV polymerization as described (27Boban M. Zargari A. Andréasson C. Heessen S. Thyberg J. Ljungdahl P.O. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 695-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Thin sections were cut on a Leica Ultracut and picked up on formvar-coated nickel grids. For immunostaining, the sections were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.3, for 30 min, and incubated for 120 min with rat anti-HA antibodies (clone 3F10, Roche) diluted 1:50 in PBS, 5% BSA. The grids were then rinsed repeatedly with PBS, 5% BSA and incubated for 60 min with goat anti-rat IgG conjugated to 12-nm gold particles (Jackson ImmunoResearch) diluted 1:20 in PBS, 0.5% BSA. After repeated washing with PBS, 0.5% BSA and PBS alone, the grids were post fixed for 5 min with 2% glutaraldehyde in PBS, washed with PBS and water, and allowed to dry. Contrast staining was made with saturated uranyl acetate for 5 min and lead citrate for 5 s. Finally, the sections were examined in a Philips CM120 electron microscope at 80 kV and photographed using a CCD camera (Kodak MegaPlus). For quantitative evaluation of the immunogold labeling, successive cells were photographed at high magnification and the distance of all gold particles from the midline of the nuclear envelope was measured using the analySIS system (Soft Imaging Software, Münster, Germany). Subcellular Fractionation—Cells expressing functional epitope-tagged ASI1-HA, ASI2-HA, and ASI3-HA were grown in SC to an A600 of 0.8. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and protein extracts were prepared by vortexing cells seven cycles (30 s vortex followed by 30 s on ice) with glass beads (1 μmin diameter) in lysis buffer (0.8 m sorbitol, 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 2 mm NaEDTA) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 units/ml Trasylol, and Complete protease inhibitors (Roche). Unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The extracted proteins were fractionated on 12-60% sucrose gradients as described by Ref. 35Egner R. Mahé Y. Pandjaitan R. Kuchler K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5879-5887Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar. Fractions (1 ml) were collected from the bottom of the gradients using a Fraction Recovery System (Beckman). Proteins from equal aliquots of fractions were concentrated by trichloroacetic acid precipitation, separated by SDS-PAGE, and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were incubated with primary antibodies in blocking buffer diluted as follows: 12CA5 ascites fluid (Anti-HA monoclonal), 1:1500; rabbit anti-Pma1p, 1:3000; rabbit anti-Wbp1p, 1:1000; mouse monoclonal anti-Vps10p, 1:1000. Asi1, Asi2, and Asi3 Membrane Association—Cells, grown in SC to an A600 of 0.8, were harvested by centrifugation, washed once with cold 10 mm NaN3, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C. Cell lysates were prepared and fractionated on 12-60% sucrose gradients as described in the preceding section. Microsomal fractions containing Asi proteins (fractions 1-6, from the bottom) were pooled and diluted 1:2 with HDB buffer (25 mm HEPES, 0.7 mm Na2HPO4, 137 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, pH 7.3-7.4) containing Complete protease inhibitor (Roche). Membranes were isolated by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1.5 h at 4 °C. Membrane pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of HDB buffer containing Complete protease inhibitor, and the protein concentration was measured (Bio-Rad). Aliquots of membrane suspensions (600 μg) were incubated in the presence of detergent for 15 min at room temperature; samples were continuously mixed by inversion. Attempted solubilization conditions are as follows: 1-10% N-dodecylmaltoside (Roche Molecular Biochemicals); 1% N-dodecylmaltoside containing 70, 140, or 280 mm NaCl; 1% Triton X-100 (Sigma); 1% Tween 20 (Sigma); 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (Sigma); 1-2% sodium N-lauroyl sarcosinate (SLS) (Sigma); or 1% SLS and 1% Triton X-100. Detergent extracts were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1.5 h at 4 °C. Proteins in soluble and pellet fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE in 10% polyacrylamide gels, and immunoblotted. Blots were incubated with primary antibodies in blocking buffer diluted as follows: 12CA5 ascites fluid (anti-HA monoclonal), 1:1500; anti-myc (monoclonal antibody 9E10), 1:1500; and anti-Dpm1 (monoclonal antibody), 1:500. Immunoprecipitation and Glutathione S-Transferase (GST) Purifications—Cells, pregrown in SC and washed once with sterile water, were used to inoculate SC containing 8% galactose (no glucose) to an initial A600 of 0.05, and cultures were grown to an A600 of 0.8. Cells were harvested, washed once in cold 10 mm NaN3, and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Microsomes containing Asi proteins were prepared and membrane proteins were solubilized in the presence of 1% SLS and 1% Triton X-100. Detergent-solubilized proteins were incubated overnight at 4 °C with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) or anti-HA affinity matrix (Roche). The beads were pelleted by centrifugation for 2 min at 3,000 × g (supernatant = flow-through) and washed five times with HDB buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and Complete protease inhibitor. Twenty μl of 2× SDS sample buffer were added to 20 μl of the beads to elute bound protein. Proteins, denatured for 10 min at 45 °C, were resolved by SDS-PAGE in 12% polyacrylamide gels, and immunoblotted. Anti-GST rabbit polyclonal antibody was used at a concentration of 2 μg/ml. Online Supplemental Material—Detailed descriptions of strain and plasmid constructions are described in the supplemental materials. Null mutations in ASI1, ASI2, and ASI3 are recessive, and lead to constitutive transcription of SPS sensor-regulated amino acid permease genes (19Forsberg H. Ljungdahl P.O. Curr. Genet. 2001; 40: 91-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), indicating that Asi proteins function as negative regulators of SPS sensor signaling. We have shown that Asi1 negatively regulates gene expression under non-inducing conditions, i.e. in the absence of extracellular amino acids. It does so by preventing transcription factors Stp1 and Stp2 from binding SPS sensor-regulated promoters (27Boban M. Zargari A. Andréasson C. Heessen S. Thyberg J. Ljungdahl P.O. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 695-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We anticipated that if the Asi2 and Asi3 proteins function similarly to Asi1, then strains carrying multiple mutations in ASI genes would display phenotypes similar to those of the single mutant strains. Also, the constitutive expression of SPS sensor-regulated genes in asi2 and asi3 mutants would be Stp1 and Stp2 dependent. Conversely, if the Asi proteins function independently, strains carrying multiple mutations would likely exhibit altered or exaggerated phenotypes."

PP2A is a family of heterotrimeric holoenzymes containing one of more than a dozen different regulatory subunits. In comparison with rat forebrain extracts, adrenal gland extracts exhibited TH hyperphosphorylation at Ser19, Ser31, and Ser40, as well as reduced phosphatase activity selectively toward phosphorylated TH. Because the B′β regulatory subunit of PP2A is expressed in brain but not in adrenal glands, we tested the hypothesis that PP2A/B′β is a specific TH phosphatase. In catecholamine-secreting PC12 cells, inducible expression of B′β decreased both N-terminal Ser phosphorylation and in situ TH activity, whereas inducible silencing of endogenous B′β had the opposite effect. Furthermore, PP2A/B′β directly dephosphorylated TH in vitro. As to specificity, other PP2A regulatory subunits had negligible effects on TH activity and phosphorylation in situ and in vitro. Whereas B′β was highly expressed in dopaminergic cell bodies in the substantia nigra, the PP2A regulatory subunit was excluded from TH-positive terminal fields in the striatum and failed to colocalize with presynaptic markers in general. Consistent with a model in which B′β enrichment in neuronal cell bodies helps confine catecholamine synthesis to axon terminals, TH phosphorylation was higher in processes than in somata of dopaminergic neurons. In summary, we show that B′β recruits PP2A to modulate TH activity in a tissue- and cell compartment specific fashion.

Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) 2The abbreviations used are: TH, tyrosine hydroxylase; CaMKII, calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II; DOPA, l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; MBP, myelin basic protein; PKA, protein kinase A; PP, protein phosphatase; RNAi, RNA interference. catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis of catecholamines (dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine) from the amino acid precursor l-tyrosine (1Levitt M. Spector S. Sjoerdsma A. Udenfriend S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1965; 148: 1-8PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme consists of an N-terminal regulatory domain, a central catalytic domain, and a C-terminal association domain, which mediates tetrameric assembly (2Kumer S.C. Vrana K.E. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 443-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar, 3Goodwill K.E. Sabatier C. Marks C. Raag R. Fitzpatrick P.F. Stevens R.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Several kinases regulate TH activity by phosphorylating key serines in the regulatory domain (Ser8, Ser19, Ser31, and Ser40). Best characterized is Ser40 phosphorylation by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), which markedly enhances TH catalytic activity both in vitro and in vivo by relieving feedback inhibition by the catecholamines (4Daubner S.C.

Phosphorylation at Ser19 by calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) and at Ser31 by proline-directed kinases has comparatively moderate effects on TH activity but can facilitate subsequent Ser40 phosphorylation (10Bobrovskaya L.

Although the kinases that regulate catecholamine synthesis have been studied extensively, little is know about inactivation of TH by protein Ser/Thr phosphatases. Previous studies used the phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid to implicate PP2A as a major negative regulator of TH (12Leal R.B. Sim A.T. Goncalves C.A. Dunkley P.R. Neurochem. Res. 2002; 27: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 13Berresheim U. Kuhn D.M. Brain Res. 1994; 637: 273-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 14Haavik J. Schelling D.L. Campbell D.G. Andersson K.K. Flatmark T. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1989; 251: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, okadaic acid also inhibits the related PP4, PP5, and PP6 catalytic subunits with high affinity (15Honkanen R.E. Golden T. Curr. Med. Chem. 2002; 9: 2055-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 16Cohen P.T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 245-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar), and no information is available regarding the subunit composition of the presumptive TH phosphatase(s). As one of four major groups of serine/threonine phosphatases, PP2A exists predominantly as a heterotrimer of a 36-kDa catalytic or C subunit, a 65-kDa scaffolding or A subunit, and a variable regulatory subunit (17Gallego M. Virshup D.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 18Janssens V. Goris J. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 417-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1549) Google Scholar). Three families of regulatory subunits referred to as B, B′, and B″ associate with the core dimer of A and C subunits. The B family (or PR55) of regulatory subunits consists of four genes (α-δ). The B′ family (or B56/PR61) is encoded by five genes (α-ϵ), whereas the third B″ family consists of three genes (PR72/130, PR59, and PR48). Alternative splicing of several genes further diversifies the variable subunit repertoire. Regulatory subunits determine subcellular localization and substrate specificity and enable PP2A holoenzymes to respond to specific second messengers (19Dagda R.K. Zaucha J.A. Wadzinski B.E.

The identification of the phosphatase holoenzyme that gates catecholamine synthesis may offer insights into the etiology of neurological disorders such as Parkinson and Huntington diseases and could suggest novel interventions (28Yohrling G.J.t.

We also provide evidence that tissue- and cell compartment-specific expression of B′β modulates TH phosphorylation locally, thereby defining sites of elevated catecholamine synthesis. B′β Antibody Generation—To generate antisera specific to B′β, the synthetic peptide CPLQRLTPQVAASGGQS from the extreme C terminus of B′β was coupled to maleimide-activated keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Pierce). Antiserum was raised by Covance Research Products (Princeton, NJ) and was affinity purified by coupling the same peptide to Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad). Specificity was confirmed in heterologous expression experiments. Other Reagents—Rabbit polyclonal antibodies recognizing total TH and Ser19-phosphorylated TH were provided by John Haycock (Louisiana State University (30Haycock J.W. Anal.

The following reagents were obtained commercially: mouse TH antibody (Immunostar, Hudson, WI); mouse synaptotagmin antibody (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa); mouse bassoon antibody (Nventa, San Diego, CA); mouse FLAG tag antibody (M2) and its agarose conjugate (Sigma); extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); rabbit phospho-Ser40 TH, phospho-(Thr/Tyr) ERK1/2 and mouse HA tagdirected antibodies (Cell Signaling Technologies, Beverly, CA); rabbit phospho-Ser31 TH antibody (Chemicon, Temecula, CA); microcystin-agarose (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY); okadaic acid (EMD Biosciences, Darmstadt, Germany); and l-[1-14C] tyrosine (Moravek Biochemicals, Brea, CA). Generation of Tetracycline-inducible Overexpression and Knock-down Cell Lines—Tetracycline-inducible (T-Rex system; BD Biosciences) PC6-3 cell lines stably expressing FLAG epitope-tagged PP2A regulatory subunits and PC6-3 cells with inducible, RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knock-down of endogenous PP2A subunits were generated as described previously (34Strack S.

The B′β-silencing short hairpin (sh) RNA targets nucleotides 436-456 of the rat coding sequence (GenBank™ accession number AY251278). Inducible cell lines were cultured (37 °C, 5% CO2) on collagen-coated plates in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% horse serum and 5% fetal bovine serum containing 2 μg/ml blasticidin and 200 μg/ml of either hygromycin (overexpression) or G418 (RNAi). B′β and Bγ overexpression and silencing was induced by the addition of doxycycline (1 μg/ml) for 2-4 days prior to analysis. Control cultures received 0.1% ethanol vehicle. Tissue and Cell Extract Preparation, Purification, and Immunoblotting—Six weeks or older male Sprague-Dawley rats were euthanized by swift decapitation according to protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Iowa. Tissues dissected within 5 min of euthanasia were flash frozen on dry ice and stored at -70 °C until use. For total extract preparation, frozen tissues were pulverized and homogenized in ∼10 volumes of SDS sample buffer supplemented with 0.5 μm microcystin-LR and 2 mm EDTA to inhibit phosphatases. Homogenates were sonicated to shear DNA and cleared by centrifugation (15 min at 20,000 × g). For microcystin-agarose affinity purification and in vitro phosphatase assays, the tissues were homogenized in 3-4 volumes of buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, and 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin. Insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation. Affinity purification of PP1 and PP2A holoenzymes on microcystin-agarose was carried out as described (36Strack S. Zaucha J.A. Ebner F.F. Colbran R.J. Wadzinski B.E. J. Comp. Neurol. 1998; 392: 515-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). For immunoblot analysis, PC6-3 cells were harvested by adding SDS sample buffer plus 0.5 μm microcystin-LR, 2 mm EDTA directly to the culture plate. Homogenates were sonicated and cleared as above. Protein concentrations were determined by a dot blot assay, and quantitative immunoblotting was performed as described (35Van Kanegan M.J. Adams D.G. Wadzinski B.E. Strack S. J. Biol.

Control experiments showed that signal intensities scaled linearly with the amount of lysate loaded. Phosphatase Assay and Immunoprecipitation—Partially dephosphorylated myelin basic protein (Sigma) or GST-TH was phosphorylated at 5 μg/μl by PKA catalytic subunit (0.25 units/μl; Sigma) for 1 h at 30 °C in buffer containing 1 mm ATP, 50 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 2mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.01% Triton X-100 (19Dagda R.K.

Immunoisolation of PP2A holoenzymes containing FLAG-tagged B′β and Bγ and radioactive phosphatase assays were performed as described previously (19Dagda R.K. Zaucha J.A. Wadzinski B.E. Strack S. J.

Trials varying the enzyme concentration established the linear range of the assay (<20% of total 32P released). TH Activity Assay—An in situ dopamine biosynthesis assay, which monitors 14CO2 production following the conversion of l-[1-14C] tyrosine to dopamine, was carried out as described (37Cheah T.B. Bobrovskaya L. Goncalves C.A. Hall A. Elliot R. Lengyel I. Bunn S.J. Marley P.D. Dunkley P.R. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1999; 87: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, PC6-3 cells growing in 24-well plates (4-6 wells/condition) were treated with doxycycline for 3 days to induce either overexpression or RNAi-mediated silencing of PP2A regulatory subunits. After replacing the medium with Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 1 μCi/ml of l-[1-14C]tyrosine, the wells were immediately sealed with a small chimney capped with a rubber stopper and fitted with a plastic cup containing 300 μ l of 1 m NaOH to absorb the 14CO2 released by the cells. After 1 h, NaOH was subjected to liquid scintillation counting, subtracting blank values of wells without cells. Immunofluorescence—The brains of adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were fixed by transcardial perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose, and free-floating 40-μm sagittal sections were cut on a cryostat. Dissociated rat hippocampal cultures were prepared from embryonic day 18 pups as described (38Lim I.A. Merrill M.A. Chen Y. Hell J.W. Neuropharmacology. 2003; 45: 738-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), plated onto poly d-lysine coated 2-well chamber slides (Nalge Nunc, Naperville, IL), and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde after 17 days in culture. After blocking in 2% normal donkey serum, sections and cultures were incubated (16 h, 4 °C) with a combination of the following primary antibodies: mouse anti-TH (1:1600 dilution), rabbit anti-phospho-Ser19 TH (1:1200), mouse anti-synaptotagmin (1:20), mouse anti-bassoon (1:1000), and rabbit anti-B′β (1:300). Bound primary antibodies were detected with AlexaFluor 488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, PA) and visualized with a digital camera-equipped epifluorescence microscope. Total and phospho-Ser19 TH immunofluorescence signals were digitally quantified after outlining cell bodies and processes using ImageJ software. Correlation of TH Dephosphorylation and PP2A/B′β Expression in Tissues—We examined expression and phosphorylation of TH in a panel of rat tissues by immunoblotting with total and phospho-specific TH antibodies. As expected, TH was detected only in forebrain and adrenal gland. Unexpectedly, Ser40-phosphorylated TH was strikingly enriched in adrenal gland compared with forebrain (Fig. 1A, top panel). In addition to the PKA site, TH phosphorylation of the CaMKII site Ser19 and the ERK/Cdk5 site Ser31 was also substantially higher in adrenal gland (Fig. 1B). The simplest explanation for this result is that adrenal gland has less TH-directed phosphatase activity than brain tissue. Speculating that a brain-specific PP2A regulatory subunit could be responsible for the comparative hypophosphorylation of TH in this tissue, we explored the expression pattern of different PP2A subunits by immunoblotting tissue extract after affinity purification with microcystin-agarose. Microcystin binds with high affinity to catalytic subunits of PP1 and PP2A and microcystin affinity resins have been used to document the specificity of PP2A regulatory subunit antibodies (36Strack S.

Neurol. 1998; 392: 515-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 39Strack S. Kini S. Ebner F.F. Wadzinski B.E. Colbran R.J. J. Comp.

In contrast, one of the five B′ subunit family members, B′β was almost exclusively localized to forebrain and cerebellum. The enrichment of B′β protein in the brain is in accordance with earlier mRNA expression studies (40McCright B. Virshup D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26123-26128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 41Martens E. Stevens I. Janssens V. Vermeesch J. Gotz J. Goris J. Van Hoof C. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 336: 971-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis that increased TH phosphorylation in adrenal gland is due to the absence of a specific TH phosphatase such as PP2A/B′β, we compared phosphatase activities in forebrain and adrenal gland extracts, using either a PKA-phosphorylated GST-TH fusion protein (regulatory domain residues 31-164 (32Moy L.Y. Tsai L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54487-54493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar)) or myelin basic protein (MBP) as substrates. Forebrain extracts were able to dephosphorylate 32P-labeled TH much more readily than adrenal gland extracts, with an activity ratio of 3.2 ± 0.7 (n = 4, p < 0.01) in extract dilutions matched for PP2A catalytic subunit content (Fig. 1C). The higher phosphatase activity in brain was specific for the [32P]TH substrate, because forebrain and adrenal gland extracts dephosphorylated [32P]MBP to the same extent. In combination, these data suggest that tissue-specific expression of PP2A/B′β inhibits TH phosphorylation. PP2A/B′β Mediates TH Dephosphorylation in Cells—To directly examine the modulation of TH by different PP2A heterotrimeric complexes, we turned to PC12 pheochromocytoma cells as a model system, specifically the PC6-3 subline (42Pittman R.N. Wang S. DiBenedetto A.J. Mills J.C. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 3669-3680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Derived from rat adrenal chromaffin cells, PC12 and PC6-3 cells abundantly express TH and synthesize and secrete catecholamines (43Markey K.A. Kondo H. Shenkman L. Goldstein M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1980; 17: 79-85PubMed Google Scholar, 44Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4873) Google Scholar). Treatment of PC6-3 cells with the PP2A inhibitor okadaic acid promoted dose-dependent TH hyperphosphorylation at Ser40 (Fig. 2A). Shown for a single concentration, 250 nm, which inhibits PP2A-like phosphatases, but not PP1, PP2B, or PP2C (15Honkanen R.E. Golden T. Curr. Med. Chem. 2002; 9: 2055-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), okadaic acid increased TH phosphorylation at all three physiologically relevant sites (Ser19, Ser31, and Ser40; Fig. 2B), confirming PP2A or a related enzyme as the predominant TH phosphatase (7Haycock J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11682-11691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Leal R.B. Sim A.T. Goncalves C.A. Dunkley P.R. Neurochem.

Because tissue expression of B′β correlated with TH dephosphorylation (Fig. 1), we investigated TH phosphorylation in PC6-3 cells that transiently expressed different HA-tagged B′ subunit isoforms to similar levels (Fig. 2C). Transfection with B′β and to a lesser extent B′α, a PP2A subunit mostly found in striated muscle (40McCright B. Virshup D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26123-26128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 41Martens E. Stevens I. Janssens V. Vermeesch J. Gotz J. Goris J. Van Hoof C. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 336: 971-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), blunted phospho-Ser40 TH immunoreactivity, whereas forced expression of B′ isoforms B′γ and B′δ had no significant effect (Fig. 2, C and D). To study the regulation of TH by PP2A in a homogenous cell population, we generated stable PC6-3 cell lines expressing FLAG epitope-tagged regulatory subunits under the control of a tetracycline/doxycycline-inducible cytomegalovirus promoter. Overexpressed regulatory subunits appear to associate with a pool of free PP2A core dimer and do not cause compensatory changes in the levels of other PP2A subunits (19Dagda R.K. Zaucha J.A.

Chem. 2002; 277: 41525-41532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In particular, B′β and Bγ, a neuron-specific member of the B family of PP2A regulatory subunits, immunoprecipitated with equivalent amounts of the catalytic subunit (see Fig. 5A), indicating efficient incorporation into the PP2A holoenzyme. Inducible expression of the B′β regulatory subunit significantly reduced TH phosphorylation at Ser40, Ser31, and Ser19 (Fig. 3, A and C), whereas phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was unaffected. In contrast, induction of Bγ did not alter TH phosphorylation at any site but increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation as previously reported (34Strack S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41525-41532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Neither total TH nor total ERK levels were altered by inducible PP2A regulatory subunit expression.FIGURE 3Inducible expression and silencing of B′β controls TH phosphorylation in PC6-3 cells. A, PC6-3 cells inducibly expressing (↑) FLAG-tagged B′β or Bγ subunits were treated for 2 d with either vehicle (-) or doxycycline (dox., +), and lysates were immunoblotted as indicated.

Chem. 2004; 279: 47732-47739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Doxycycline treatment for 3-4 days decreased B′β subunit levels to 56 ± 1% (n = 4) but had no effect on TH, ERK1/2, and PP2A/B pan levels (Fig. 3B and data not shown). Silencing of endogenous B′β was associated with a significant increase in TH phosphorylation at Ser40 and Ser19 (Fig. 3, B and C). Remarkably, even though B′β overexpression decreased Ser31 phosphorylation, inducible B′β knock-down had no effect on phosphorylation at that site (Fig. 3, A, and C). It is possible that PP2A/B′β dephosphorylates Ser31 with higher efficiency, so that the ∼50% of B′β remaining after doxycycline treatment (Fig. 3B) is enough to modulate Ser31 but not Ser19 and Ser40 phosphorylation. In aggregate, these experiments establish PP2A/B′β as the major phosphatase that mediates TH dephosphorylation in PC6-3 cells. PP2A/B′β Modulates TH Activity—TH phosphorylation by PKA at Ser40 stimulates TH activity and catecholamine synthesis (46Dunkley P.R. Bobrovskaya L. Graham M.E. von Nagy-Felsobuki E.I. Dickson P.W. J. Neurochem. 2004; 91: 1025-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). To demonstrate that PP2A/B′β can also modulate TH activity, we performed TH activity assays, measuring the release of 14CO2 from cells incubated with l-[1-14C]tyrosine (Fig. 4A). The amount of CO2 produced during the conversion of l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) to dopamine by DOPA decarboxylase reflects TH activity, because TH is the rate-limiting enzyme in this biosynthetic cascade (37Cheah T.B. Bobrovskaya L. Goncalves C.A. Hall A. Elliot R. Lengyel I. Bunn S.J. Marley P.D. Dunkley P.R. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1999; 87: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The contribution of other metabolic pathways involving tyrosine was negligible during the 1-h assay, because preincubation of PC6-3 cells with 100 μm of the DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor carbidopa completely blocked 14CO2 production (data not shown). Inducible overexpression of B′β but not Bγ resulted in a robust (>50%) inhibition of 14CO2 release, closely paralleling the decrease in TH phosphorylation at Ser40 (compare Figs. 4B and 3C). Conversely, inducible RNAi of B′β significantly increased 14CO2 release (>60%; compare Figs. 4C and 3C). Global inhibition of PP2A-like phosphatases with oka"

VMD2 encodes bestrophin, an oligomeric chloride channel that is preferentially expressed in the RPE and, when mutated, causes Best macular dystrophy. Previously, we defined the VMD2 upstream region from -253 to +38 bp as being sufficient to direct RPE-specific expression in the eye, and we suggested microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) as a possible positive regulator. Here we show that in transgenic mice the -154 to +38 bp region is sufficient for RPE expression, and mutation of two E-boxes, 1 and 2, within this region leads to loss of promoter activity. A yeast one-hybrid screen using bait containing E-box 1 identified clones encoding MITF, TFE3, and TFEB, and chromatin immunoprecipitation with antibodies against these proteins enriched the VMD2 proximal promoter. Analysis using in vivo electroporation with constructs containing mutation of each E-box indicated that expression in native RPE requires both E-boxes, yet in vitro DNA binding studies suggested that MITF binds well to E-box 1 but only minimally to E-box 2. MITF knockdown by small interfering RNA (siRNA) in cell culture revealed a strong correlation between MITF and VMD2 mRNA levels. Sequential transfection of a luciferase construct with expression vectors following MITF siRNA revealed that TFE3 and TFEB can also transactivate the VMD2 promoter. Taken together, we suggest that VMD2 is regulated by the MITF-TFE family through two E-boxes, with E-box 1 required for a direct interaction of MITF-TFE factors and E-box 2 for binding of the as yet unidentified factor(s).

Information about specific transcription factors regulating RPE expression is advancing, although still quite limited (27Martinez-Morales J.R. Dolez V. Rodrigo I. Zaccarini R. Leconte L. Bovolenta P.

To analyze RPE gene regulation in the context of a gene important for retinal disease, we have been studying VMD2 regulation as a model system (29Esumi N. Oshima Y. Li Y. Campochiaro P.A. Zack D.J.

Histopathologically, Best disease is characterized by accumulation of lipofuscin-like material within and beneath the RPE, a finding similar to that seen in age-related macular degeneration (30Weingeist T.A.

Mutations in VMD2 were also identified in families with nanophthalmos associated with autosomal dominant vitreoretinochoroidopathy, suggesting a role for VMD2 in ocular development (37Yardley J.

Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2004; 45: 3683-3689Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar).In our previous analysis of the VMD2 promoter, transgenic mouse studies revealed that the human -253 to +38 bp promoter fragment is sufficient to direct RPE-specific expression in the eye (29Esumi N.

Using transient transfection assays with the D407 human RPE cell line, two positive regulatory regions were identified as follows: -585 to -541 bp for high level expression and -56 to -42 bp for low level expression. The -56 to -42 bp region contains a canonical E-box (designated E-box 1, -47 to -42 bp), and another E-box is located nearby (E-box 2, -69 to -64 bp). Mutation of E-box 1 greatly diminished luciferase expression in D407 cells and abolished the bands shifted with bovine RPE nuclear extract in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs), although mutation of E-box 2 had only a moderate effect on luciferase activity, and EMSAs with E-box 2-containing probes did not yield distinct shifted bands (29Esumi N.

In humans, heterozygous MITF mutations result in Waardenburg syndrome type IIA and Tietz syndrome, conditions characterized by hearing loss and pigmentation defects (46Tassabehji M. Newton V.E.

In contrast, in Mitf mutant mice (MitfMi/MitfMi), the RPE becomes thickened, loses pigmentation, and forms a multilayered structure resembling the early stage of neural retina, indicating a critical role for MITF in RPE differentiation (39Nakayama A.

In vitiligo mice (Mitfmi-vit/Mitfmi-vit), although the RPE and neural retina show grossly normal morphological development, the photoreceptors degenerate, with almost complete rod and cone loss by 2 years (53Smith S.B.

In mouse eye development, Mitf is expressed throughout the optic vesicle at embryonic day 9 (E9), but its expression is rapidly restricted to the presumptive RPE by E9.5 (40Nguyen M. Arnheiter H. Development (Camb.). 2000; 127: 3581-3591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 55Horsford D.J. Nguyen M.T. Sellar G.C. Kothary R. Arnheiter H. McInnes R.R. Development (Camb.). 2005; 132: 177-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). This restriction in expression appears to be developmentally important in that maintenance of the identity of the neural retina requires repression of Mitf by Chx10 (55Horsford D.J. Nguyen M.T. Sellar G.C. Kothary R. Arnheiter H. McInnes R.R. Development (Camb.). 2005; 132: 177-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 56Rowan S. Chen C.M. Young T.L. Fisher D.E. Cepko C.L. Development (Camb.). 2004; 131: 5139-5152Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar).In addition to MITF, other members of the MITF-TFE (MiT) bHLH-ZIP subfamily are TFE3 (57Beckmann H. Su L.K. Kadesch T. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 167-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), TFEB (58Carr C.S. Sharp P.A. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1993; 13: 4505-4512Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). All MiT members share an identical (basic) DNA binding domain and have highly homologous HLH and ZIP dimerization domains (38Steingrimsson E. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2004; 38: 365-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 43Hemesath T.J. Steingrimsson E. McGill G. Hansen M.J. Vaught J. Hodgkinson C.A. Arnheiter H. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Fisher D.E. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2770-2780Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). All can bind to E-box sequence in vitro as either homodimers or heterodimers with each other but not with other members of the bHLH-ZIP family (43Hemesath T.J. Steingrimsson E. McGill G. Hansen M.J. Vaught J. Hodgkinson C.A. Arnheiter H. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Fisher D.E. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2770-2780Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). Besides MITF, TFE3 also stimulates the human TYR and murine Tyrp1 promoter activities, and TFEB transactivates the murine Tyrp1 promoter in B16 mouse melanoma cells (60Verastegui C. Bertolotto C. Bille K. Abbe P. Ortonne J.P. Ballotti R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). TFE3 can collaborate with MITF to superactivate the TRAP promoter in osteoclasts in transfection assays (61Mansky K.C. Sulzbacher S. Purdom G. Nelsen L. Hume D.A. Rehli M. Ostrowski M.C. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2002; 71: 304-310PubMed Google Scholar), and MITF and TFE3 have functionally redundant roles in osteoclast development in mice (44Steingrimsson E. Tessarollo L. Pathak B. Hou L. Arnheiter H. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4477-4482Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Tfe3 knock-out mice do not exhibit visible abnormal phenotypes; however, double knockouts for Tfe3 and Mitf develop severe osteopetrosis, a phenotype not seen in mice null for either gene alone (44Steingrimsson E. Tessarollo L. Pathak B. Hou L. Arnheiter H. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4477-4482Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Knock-out mice for Tfeb die between E9.5 and E10.5 because of severe defects in placental vascularization (62Steingrimsson E. Tessarollo L. Reid S.W. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Development (Camb.). 1998; 125: 4607-4616PubMed Google Scholar). Tfec is only transiently expressed in the early developing RPE in the eye (56Rowan S. Chen C.M. Young T.L. Fisher D.E. Cepko C.L. Development (Camb.). 2004; 131: 5139-5152Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), and Tfec knock-out mice are phenotypically normal (44Steingrimsson E. Tessarollo L. Pathak B. Hou L. Arnheiter H. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4477-4482Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar).To gain further insights into the molecular mechanisms regulating RPE gene expression, we have been trying to understand the VMD2 promoter in greater detail. In this study, we further define the minimal promoter region necessary for RPE-specific expression, present data indicating that the previously identified E-boxes 1 and 2 are both important in vivo, and provide evidence strengthening our earlier suggestion of the involvement of MITF in mediating the activity of the E-boxes. Based on the DNA binding and functional data presented, we suggest a model of MITF transactivation of VMD2 in which MITF acts on E-box 1 by direct DNA binding, whereas its effect on E-box 2 is mediated by an indirect mechanism, possibly involving a second E-box binding protein. Furthermore, we present evidence suggesting that TFE3 and TFEB are also involved in modulating the VMD2 promoter.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid Construction—VMD2 promoter/luciferase reporter constructs containing the fragments -154 to +38 and -104 to +38 bp in the pGL2-Basic vector, which contains firefly luciferase gene (Promega, Madison, WI), were generated previously (29Esumi N.

Mutated VMD2 promoter/luciferase constructs containing mutation (CANNTG to ACNNTA) in E-box 1 (-47 to -42 bp, designated m1), E-box 2 (-69 to -64 bp, m2), or both (m1m2) were made in the context of the -154 to +38 bp fragment as follows. Forward oligonucleotide that corresponds to -154 to -75 bp (5′-AGGCTGTGCTAGCCGTTGCTTCTGAGCAGATTACAAGAAGGGACCAAGACAAGGACTCCTTTGTGGAGGTCCTGGCTTAG-3′) was mixed at a 10:1 ratio with the previously generated -104 to +38 bp fragments containing mutations, m1, m2, and m1m2 (29Esumi N.

All fragments were blunt-ligated into SmaI site of pGL2-Basic vector and verified by sequencing.Two VMD2 promoter/lacZ reporter constructs containing the -154 to +38 bp fragments, wild-type and m1m2, were made for transgenic mouse studies. Both fragments were generated by PCR as described above and blunt-ligated into the SmaI site upstream of lacZ gene in placF vector as described previously (29Esumi N. Oshima Y. Li Y. Campochiaro P.A.

Using this construct as a backbone, four mutated MITF-M expression vectors containing mutations from Mitf mutant strains were newly generated. Mitf mutant alleles from which mutations were used are as follows: MitfMi-wh (allele name, white; T to A transition at nucleotide 764), Mitfmi-sp (spotted; insertion of a C residue at a splice acceptor site, leading to a loss of exon 6a), Mitfmi-vit (vitiligo; G to A transition at nucleotide 793), and Mitfmi-enu198 (enu198; A to G transition at nucleotide 749) (Mouse Genome Informatics, The Jackson Laboratory) (63Steingrimsson E.

A point mutation (MitfMi-wh, Mitfmi-vit, and Mitfmi-enu198) was introduced into the corresponding position of the wild-type human MITF-M expression vector using QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with the following primers. For mutation of MitfMi-wh, forward primer 5′-GGCAGAAAAAGGACAATCACAACCTGAATGAACGAAGAAGAAG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CTTCTTCTTCGTTCATTCAGGTTGTGATTGTCCTTTTTCTGCC-3′; for Mitfmi-vit, forward primer 5′-CGAAGAAGAAGATTTAACATAAATAACCGCATTAAAGAACTAGG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CCTAGTTCTTTAATGCGGTTATTTATGTTAAATCTTCTTCTTCG-3′, and for Mitfmi-enu198, forward primer 5′-GCCAAAGAGAGGCAGAAAAAGGGCAATCACAACCTGATTG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CAATCAGGTTGTGATTGCCCTTTTTCTGCCTCTCTTTGGC-3′. MITF-M cDNA with an 18-bp deletion leading to a loss of exon 6a (Mitfmi-sp) was obtained among the natural splice variants from human RPE RNA by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and subcloned into pcDNA3.1/Myc-His(-) B vector as described previously (29Esumi N.

Bernstein P.S. Bok D. Turner J. Nachtigal M. Hunt R.C. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1995; 36: 955-964PubMed Google Scholar). Five human melanoma cell lines were screened for the expression of VMD2 by RT-PCR as described previously (29Esumi N. Oshima Y. Li Y. Campochiaro P.A. Zack D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19064-19073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The expression of MITF-M in these melanoma cells was also checked using a forward primer 5′-CTACCGTCTCTCACTGGATTG-3′ and a reverse primer 5′-CATCATCCATCTGCATACAGG-3′. Based on these results, SK-MEL-5 cells (66Carey T.E. Takahashi T. Resnick L.A. Oettgen H.F. Old L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Plasmid DNA for each 60-mm dish included 3 μg of a firefly luciferase construct and 0.1 ng of pRL-CMV containing Renilla luciferase gene (Promega) as an internal control for transfection efficiency. Because we found that MITF-M activates the cytomegalovirus promoter in control pRL-CMV, we instead utilized pRL-TK containing Renilla luciferase gene driven by the thymidine kinase promoter (Promega), which is not affected by MITF-M, as control for co-transfection studies involving MITF-M. For these studies, DNA mixture for each dish included 3 μg of a firefly luciferase"

Starvation of 6–7-week-old rats for 14 h decreased leptin mRNA level by only 22% but decreased plasma levels, adipose tissue leptin content, and release by over 75%. The decreased leptin with starvation was explained by >85% decrease in relative rates of leptin biosynthesis measured by metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation. In vitro insulin treatment of adipose tissue from fed or starved rats for 2 h increased relative rates of leptin biosynthesis by 2–3-fold, and the effect was blocked by inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase or mammalian target of rapamycin. Consistent with the hypothesis that feeding/insulin increases leptin translation, more leptin mRNA was associated with polysomes in adipose tissue of fed than starved rats, and in vitro incubation of adipose tissue of starved rats with insulin shifted leptin mRNA into polysomes. To assess the mechanisms regulating leptin translation, chimeric human leptin untranslated region (UTR) reporter constructs were transiently transfected into differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The 5′-UTR of leptin mRNA increased luciferase reporter activity 2–3-fold, whereas the full-length 3′-UTR (nucleotides 1–2804) was inhibitory (–65%). Sequences between nucleotides 462 and 1130 of the leptin 3′-UTR conferred most of the inhibitory effect. Insulin stimulated the expression of constructs that included both the full-length 5′-UTR and the inhibitory 3′-UTR, and the effect was blocked by inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase or mammalian target of rapamycin.

Serum leptin levels decrease with starvation and increase in response to feeding. These changes in serum leptin are not entirely accounted for by variations in leptin mRNA levels (1Becker D.J.

In vitro, insulin increases leptin secretion from rat adipocytes 2-fold without affecting leptin mRNA levels, and the insulin effect was not blocked by inhibition of transcription with actinomycin D (5Roh C. Han J.R. Tzatsos A. Kandror K.V. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: E322-E330Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 6Bradley R.L. Cheatham B. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 272-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), suggesting that insulin increases leptin release through post-transcriptional mechanisms. No previous studies have directly assessed the regulation of leptin by feeding or insulin at the translational step. Thus, in the current study, we used metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation to measure basal and insulin-stimulated leptin biosynthesis in adipose tissue from fed and starved rats. To provide further evidence for translational regulation of leptin mRNA, we compared polysome profiles in adipose tissue from fed and starved rats and the effects of in vitro insulin treatment. The 5′-untranslated region (UTR) 2The abbreviations used are: used: UTR, untranslated region; LPL, lipoprotein lipase; LUC, luciferase; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; RT, reverse transcription. 2The abbreviations used are: used: UTR, untranslated region; LPL, lipoprotein lipase; LUC, luciferase; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; RT, reverse transcription. of mouse and human leptin mRNA has potential for secondary structure that is implicated in translational regulation (5Roh C. Han J.R. Tzatsos A. Kandror K.V. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: E322-E330Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Additionally, the 3′-UTR of both mouse and human leptin is relatively long (∼3 kb) and possesses multiple conserved motifs with high potential for secondary structure (7Zhang Y. Proenca R. Maffei M. Barone M. Leopold L. Friedman J.M. Nature. 1994; 372: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (11668) Google Scholar). 3M.-J. Lee, R.-Z. Yang, D.-W. Gong, and S. K. Fried, unpublished results. 3M.-J. Lee, R.-Z. Yang, D.-W. Gong, and S. K. Fried, unpublished results. We noted potential AU-rich elements in the 3′-leptin UTR including a UUAUUUAUU nonamer (nucleotides 487–495, where 1 is the first nucleotide after stop codon, see Fig. 6A) and several AUUU(U)A (starting at nucleotides 499, 785, 1765, and 1951) that are implicated in controlling mRNA stability and translation (8Zhang T. Kruys V. Huez G. Gueydan C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 952-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the effects of the 5′- and 3′-UTRs of human leptin mRNA on expression of a reporter gene after transfection into differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Overall, our data show that insulin increases leptin translation through mechanisms involving both the 5′- and the 3′-leptin UTRs. The stimulatory effect of insulin on leptin synthesis may contribute to the increase in leptin production with feeding. Animals—Male Wistar rats (5 weeks old) were purchased (Charles River Laboratory, Wilmington, MA) and housed with free access to laboratory chow and water until they reached the age of 6–7 weeks. The dark-light cycle was maintained at 12 h of dark and 12 h of light. After 14 h of starvation or ad libitum feeding with water available, animals were anesthetized using CO2 and killed by decapitation, and trunk blood was collected. Epididymal and retroperitoneal fat pads were dissected, pooled, minced into 5–10-mg fragments, and then used for experiments. After washing with 0.9% NaCl on a 250-μm nylon mesh, an aliquot of tissue was frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen to measure tissue leptin content and leptin mRNA levels. The protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Maryland at Baltimore. Measurement of Leptin Secretion and Tissue Leptin Content—Leptin release and tissue leptin content were measured as described previously (9Russell C.D. Ricci M.R. Brolin R.E. Magill E. Fried S.K. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: E399-E404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Leptin concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassay (Linco, St Charles, MO) with inclusion of an additional standard (0.25 ng/ml). Determination of Fat Cell Size and Fat Cell Number—Mean fat cell weight was determined by Coulter counting of freshly isolated adipocytes (10Maroni B.J. Haesemeyer R. Wilson L.K. DiGirolamo M. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 1703-1709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fat cell number was determined by dividing the weight of lipid in tissue (measured with Folch extraction (11Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) by mean fat cell weight. Measurement of Relative Rates of Leptin Biosynthesis—After preincubation of adipose tissue fragments in minimal essential medium (without methionine and cysteine, Sigma) in the absence (basal) or presence of insulin (6 nm) for 1 h at 37 °C, the media were exchanged for minimal essential medium containing [35S]methionine/cysteine (500 μCi/ml, Easy-Tag™ EXPRE35S35S protein labeling mix, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) under the same hormonal conditions, and the incubation proceeded for another 45 min for labeling. Preliminary experiments showed that the incorporation of [35S]methionine/cysteine into total protein is linear up to 90 min and that [35S]methionine/cysteine incorporation into leptin is linear up to 60 min in rat adipose tissue. [35S]Leptin was then immunoprecipitated from tissue homogenates as described previously (12Ricci M.R. Lee M.J. Russell C.D. Wang Y. Sullivan S. Schneider S.H. Brolin R.E. Fried S.K. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: E798-E804Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) using a polyclonal human leptin antibody from rabbit (Biovender, Brno, Czech Republic) followed by 4–12% SDS-PAGE. [35S]Leptin bands were detected using PhosphorImager (Storm 860, GE Healthcare), and band intensities were quantified with ImageQuant software 5.0 (GE Healthcare). The completeness and specificity of immunoprecipitation was confirmed. Incorporation of the label into trichloroacetic acid-precipitable protein was determined (13Rogers J. Munro H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2277-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and rates of leptin biosynthesis under different conditions were normalized to this value to calculate relative rates of leptin biosynthesis. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) was immunoprecipitated by adding 3 μg of chicken anti-bovine LPL antibody (gift from Dr. J. Goers, California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, CA) as described previously (14Lee J.J. Smith P.J. Fried S.K. J. Nutr. 1998; 128: 940-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Effect of Chemical Inhibition of the PI3K-mTOR Pathway—Adipose tissue fragments were preincubated and pulse-labeled in the absence or presence of inhibitors (50 μm LY294002, 100 nm wortmannin, and 100 nm rapamycin), with or without insulin, as described above. After pulse labeling, labeled leptin was immunoprecipitated and analyzed as described above. RNA Extraction and Northern Blotting—Total RNA was extracted from adipose tissue (frozen immediately (0 minutes)) or after incubation in the absence (basal) or in the presence of insulin (6 nm) for 2 h using the modified method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (15Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63087) Google Scholar). Leptin mRNA levels were detected as described previously (16Russell C.D. Petersen R.N. Rao S.P. Ricci M.R. Prasad A. Zhang Y. Brolin R.E. Fried S.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 38: E507-E515Crossref Google Scholar). Polysome Profile and RT-PCR—Polysome profiles were obtained as described previously (13Rogers J. Munro H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2277-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Post-mitochondrial supernatant was prepared from adipose tissue from overnight starved or ad libitum fed rats and after insulin treatment by homogenizing tissue in Buffer I (10 mm Tris, 150 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1% TritonX-100, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 150 μg/ml cyclohexamide, 250 μg/ml heparin, 100 units/ml RNasin®) and centrifugation. The tissue lysate was layered on the top of a 10–50% continuous sucrose gradient prepared in Buffer II (20 mm HEPES, 250 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml cyclohexamide, 0.5 μg/ml heparin, 3.3 units/ml RNasin®) and was centrifuged at 141,000 × g, 4 °C for 4 h. The gradients were fractionated into 1-ml fractions, and the UV absorption at A260 was recorded. 12–14 fractions were collected, and total RNA was extracted from each fraction. Equal volumes of each fraction containing 0.1–1 ng of RNA were reverse-transcribed using oligo(dT) primers (Advantage™ RT-for-PCR kit, Clontech). Leptin mRNA levels in each fraction were measured with PCR. Cyclophilin A mRNA level in each fraction was determined and used as control gene (see Table 1). After electrophoresis on agarose, the ethidium bromide-stained gel was imaged and analyzed using the Bio-Rad VersaDoc quantitation and analysis software (Bio-Rad).TABLE 1Sequences of oligomers used for generation of reporter constructs, sequencing and RT-PCROligonucleotide nameSequenceConstruct 5′-UTRpGL3Hob5′-UTR F5′-CCCAAGCTTGTAGGAATCGCAGCGCCAACGGTTGCAAGGCCCAAGAAGCCATCCTGGGAAGGAAACCATGGCATG-3′Hob 5-UTR R5′-CATGCCATGGTTTCCTTCCCAGGATGGCTTCTTGGGCCTTGCAACCGTGGCGCTGCGATTCCTACAAGCTTGGG-3′ 3′-UTRpGL3-fullHOB 3UTR: 1-20-EcoRV F5′-GATATCGGCCTTGAAGGTCACTCTTC-3′HOB 3UTR: 2804-2782-Fse1 R5′-GGCCGGCCAAGACGGAATCTCGCTCTGTCAT-3′3′-UTRpGL3-1.1kbHob 3utr: 1130-Fse1∼1110 R5′-TCGGCCGGCCACTGCCCCAACAAATGGCT-3′ 3′-UTRpGL3-0.5kbHob 3utr: 462-Fse1–442 R5′-TCGGCCGGCCTGGGAGTTCCTGCGTGTGTGG-3′Sequencing VectorT3 primer5′-AATTAACCCTCACTAAAGGG-3′ VectorT7 primer5′-GTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC-3′ VectorRVprimer3; pGL3 control5′-CTAGCAAAATAGGCTGTCCC-3′ VectorPGL3 control 1981-19085′-ATCCTCATAAAGGCCAAG-3′ VectorPGL3 control 1998-19835′-TTGTCCAAACTCATCAAT-3′ Leptin 3′-UTRHob 3UTR 501-5185′-TTTTATTCTGGATGGATT-3′ Leptin 3′-UTRHob 3UTR 1001-10185′-GGCCAGGCACCTCCTGGA-3′ Leptin 3′-UTRHob 3UTR 1501-15185′-TTCAGGAAGATGAAAGAG-3′ Leptin 3′-UTRHob 3UTR 2001-10185′-GACCAGGACTATAGCCCA-3′ Leptin 3′-UTRHob 3UTR 2488-25055′-TGTCTGTTTTTGTAACTT-3′ Leptin 3′-UTRHob 3UTR 2400-23885′-ATTAGGTGGTTGTGAGGA-3′ Leptin 3′-UTRHob 3UTR 1918-19015′-TAATAGAAGCTAAGATGC-3′RT-PCR LeptinLeptin F5′-CACCAAAACCCTCATCAAGAC-3′ LeptinLeptin R5′-AGCTCTTAGAGAAGGCCAGCA-3′ Cyclophilin ACyclophilin A F5′-ACACGCCATAATGGCACTGG-3′ Cyclophilin ACyclophilin A R5′-GCTCTCCTGAGCTACAGAAG-3′ LuciferaseLuc F5′-GAATCG TCGTATGCAGTGAAAA-3′ LuciferaseLuc R5′-TGACCAGTAGATCCAGAGGAG-3′ Open table in a new tab 3T3-L1 Adipocytes Culture—3T3-L1 fibroblast cells were plated in 3.5-cm dishes and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with 10% calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 1% antibiotics (Pen/Strep®, Invitrogen). After cells reached over confluence, preadipocytes were differentiated in 10% fetal bovine serum Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.5 mm isobutyl-1-methylxanthene, insulin (167 nm), and dexamethasone (1 μm). Medium was replenished every other day, and cells were subcultured on a weekly basis usually after reaching 60∼70% confluence. All experiments were conducted between the second and the fifth subculture. Chimeric Leptin UTR-Luciferase Reporter Constructs—The primers and oligomers (Table 1) used to generate the leptin UTR PCR transcripts were designed using human leptin mRNA sequence (GenBank™ accession number, gi 6981147). The leptin UTRs were cloned into the pGL3 control vector (Promega, Madison, WI) that contains SV40 promoter and enhancer sequences to drive a high and stable expression of luciferase (LUC). The entire 5′-UTR of human leptin mRNA (56 bp, synthesized as oligomers with HindIII and NcoI restriction sites) was cloned into the upstream of luciferase coding region. The entire (or truncated) 3′-UTR was then cloned into the downstream of the luciferase. Leptin 3′-UTR truncations left 462, 1130, or 2804 nucleotides (where 1 is the first nucleotide after stop codon, see Fig. 5) were generated by PCR using a full-length human leptin cDNA plasmid as template (17Gong D.W. Bi S. Pratley R.E. Weintraub B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3971-3974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Transient Transfection of Reporter Constructs into Differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes and Luciferase Assay—On day 4 of differentiation, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were transfected with 1 μg of DNA using Lipofectamine Plus reagents (Invitrogen). Briefly, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with reduced serum medium (Opti-MEM®, modification of Eagle's minimal essential medium, Invitrogen) for 45 min at 37 °C. Pre-complex DNA-Plus-Lipofectamine™ reagent was prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and added into each well for transfection. After overnight transfection, cells were replenished with 10% fetal bovine serum Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated for another 36–48 h for expression. For monitoring transfection efficiency, pRL-TK vector (containing Renilla luciferase, Promega) was co-transfected. Cells co-transfected with various UTR-pGL3 constructs and pRL-TK vectors were harvested in lysis buffer, and activities of firefly and Renilla luciferase were measured by using the Dual-Luciferase assay kit (Promega) in a luminometer (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA). The reporter activity was expressed as arbitrary LUC units (firefly/Renilla). To determine whether insulin increases the activity of the leptin-UTR-luciferase constructs, cells were incubated with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5 mm glucose and 3% bovine serum albumin, with or without insulin (100 nm), for an additional 3 h prior to harvesting. To assess the signaling pathways by which insulin increased luciferase activity, cells transfected with constructs containing full-length 5′- and 3′-UTR (3′-5′-UTR-LUC) were treated for 16 h with or without insulin in the absence or presence of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) (LY294002, 50 μm or wortmannin, 100 nm) or the mTOR inhibitor (rapamycin, 100 nm). RNA Extraction and RT-PCR—Parallel wells were transfected and used for RNA extraction using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). LUC mRNA levels were determined by performing RT-PCR using a DuraScript™ RT-PCR kit (Sigma). Cyclophilin A mRNA levels were used as a control. Products were run on 1% agarose gels, visualized by staining with ethidium bromide, and quantified using the Bio-Rad imaging system. Statistical Analyses—All data are mean ± S.E. Prior to statistical analysis, data were log-transformed to normalize variance. One-way or two-way analysis of variance was used to determine treatment effects versus the appropriate control group at a specific time point. When significant main effects and/or interactions were found, post hoc comparisons between treatments were made with a Bonferroni t test. Significance was set at the p < 0.05 level. Changes in Leptin mRNA Levels Do Not Explain the Decreased Leptin Release or Adipose and Serum Leptin Levels after Short Term Starvation—Body weight and fat cell size of overnight-starved (14 h) rats did not differ from those of ad libitum fed animals (Table 2, NS, n = 4 each). Overnight starvation decreased leptin mRNA levels in adipose tissue by 22% (see Fig. 2A, p = 0.034, n = 5), yet decreased serum leptin by more than 85% (1.7 ng/ml versus not detectable <0.25 ng/ml, p < 0.01, n = 4). In addition, overnight starvation decreased tissue leptin content by 74 ± 9% (fed; 22 ± 5 versus starved; 7 ± 2 ng of leptin/107 cells, p < 0.01, n = 5) (Fig. 1). Leptin release during an acute 3-h incubation of tissue fragments was 90% lower in adipose tissue from starved as compared with fed rats (fed; 33.9 ± 10.7 versus starved; 3.6 ± 2.1 ng of leptin/107 cells × 3 h, p < 0.01, n = 5). Interestingly, adipose tissue from fed animals secreted more leptin than their initial stores (160 ± 8%), suggesting that new synthesis contributes to leptin release over 3 h. In contrast, adipose tissue from starved animals secreted less than their initial leptin stores (60 ± 6% of their initial level).TABLE 2Characteristics of fed and starved ratsBody weightFat cell sizeSerum leptingμg lipid/cellng leptin/mlFed173.1 ± 2.10.049 ± 0.0051.7 ± 0.1Starved169.4 ± 3.70.045 ± 0.007ND* Open table in a new tab FIGURE 1Starvation decreased tissue leptin content and leptin secretion in rat (6–7 weeks old) adipose tissue.

Aliquots of tissue were homogenated in buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 to measure tissue leptin content. Leptin levels in the tissue lysates and incubation media were measured with radioimmunoassay. Data were presented as ng of leptin per 107 cells (mean ± S.E., ≥ three independent repeats), analyzed with two-way analysis of variance, and followed by Bonferroni paired t test.

Starvation decreased the general protein synthesis in adipose tissue by ∼25% (fed; 10.8 ± 2.0 versus starved; 8.0 ± 2.5 × 106 cpm/106 cells, n = 3), as expected (14Lee J.J. Smith P.J. Fried S.K. J. Nutr. 1998; 128: 940-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Even after correcting for its effect on general protein synthesis, overnight starvation decreased relative rates of leptin biosynthesis by more than 85% (Fig. 2B, p < 0.01, n = 4). In accordance with previous studies on adipocytes from fed rats (5Roh C. Han J.R. Tzatsos A. Kandror K.V. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: E322-E330Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 6Bradley R.L. Cheatham B. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 272-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), insulin treatment in vitro for 2 h did not affect leptin mRNA levels in either starved or fed adipose tissue. However, insulin increased total protein synthesis (starved: basal; 8.0 ± 2.5 versus insulin; 9.2 ± 2.9 × 106 trichloroacetic acid-precipitable cpm/106 cells, n = 3; fed: basal; 10.8 ± 2.0 versus insulin; 14.4 ± 2.3 × 106 cpm/106 cells, n = 3) as well as relative rates of leptin biosynthesis. After correcting for the difference in total protein synthesis, insulin stimulated in relative rates of leptin biosynthesis in adipose tissue of starved rats by 3-fold and ad libitum fed rats by 2-fold (each p < 0.01, n = 4; Fig. 2B). As a result, insulin stimulated rates of leptin biosynthesis were ∼4-fold greater in the fed as compared with the starved groups (p < 0.05, n = 4). The marked increase in leptin biosynthesis without a change in leptin mRNA levels indicates that insulin increased leptin biosynthesis by increasing the translation of leptin mRNA. The Effects of Starvation and Insulin on Leptin Biosynthesis Are Specific, Comparison with LPL—In agreement with previous studies (14Lee J.J. Smith P.J. Fried S.K. J. Nutr. 1998; 128: 940-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), overnight starvation did not change the rates of basal LPL biosynthesis in adipose tissue (Fig. 2C, each n = 3). These data show the decrease in leptin biosynthesis after starvation was specific and not a result of a general decline in the biosynthesis of adipose-specific genes or due to an artifact related to alterations in the specific activity of the [35S]Met/Cys precursor pool. Additionally, insulin increased the relative rates of LPL biosynthesis both in starved (+72 ± 13%, p < 0.05, n = 3) and in fed tissue (+66 ± 21%, p < 0.05, n = 3) but to a lesser extent than leptin. Signaling Pathways in Insulin-induced Leptin Biosynthesis— To investigate the signaling mechanisms by which insulin stimulates leptin biosynthesis, we tested the effect of pharmacological inhibitors of the PI3K and mTOR pathways, wortmannin or LY294002 and rapamycin, respectively. Neither inhibitor affected basal leptin synthesis or release, but both blocked the insulin stimulation of leptin biosynthesis and release (Fig. 3, A and B). The inhibitors did not affect basal but decreased insulin-stimulated general protein synthesis by 5–10% (data not shown), much less than their effects on leptin biosynthesis (over 90% inhibition). Overnight Starvation Decreased the Association of Leptin mRNA with Polyribosomes—To provide further evidence that feeding increases leptin mRNA translation, we compared polysome profiles in adipose tissue from starved and fed rats. The UV absorbance at A260 and/or the distribution of ribosomal RNA in the different gradient fractions did not differ in the fed and starved groups (Fig. 4, A and B). In adipose tissue of starved rats, ∼90% of leptin mRNA was associated with monosome/free ribosome fractions (fractions 8–12) (Fig. 4, C and D). In contrast, in adipose tissue from fed rats, 60% of leptin mRNA was associated with monosomes, and 40% of the leptin mRNA was found in the heavier fractions (fractions 1–7) that contained polyribosomes, suggesting that feeding increased the translational initiation of leptin mRNA. In contrast, starvation did not affect the association of the control mRNA cyclophilin A with polysomes, indicating that leptin is among the subset of mRNAs whose translation is specifically regulated by feeding (Data not shown). Similar results were obtained in four independent experiments. Insulin Increased the Association of Leptin mRNA with Polyribosomes—To determine whether the greater association of leptin mRNA in the fed state was mediated by insulin, the effects of insulin on the polysome profiles of leptin mRNA were analyzed after in vitro insulin treatment (6 nm, 3 h) of adipose tissue from starved animals. Insulin did not affect the UV absorbance at A260, distribution of ribosomal RNA in the different gradient fractions (Fig. 5, A and B), or the polysome profile of cyclophilin A mRNA (data not shown). Insulin shifted leptin mRNA from monosomes into polysomes fractions (Fig. 5B). The Leptin 5′-UTR Stimulated and the 3′-UTR Suppressed Expression of a Reporter Construct—To study the molecular mechanism(s) involved in the regulation of leptin translation, we tested the effects of the leptin 5′- and 3′-UTRs on the translational efficiency using chimeric luciferase reporter constructs (Fig. 6, A and B) transiently transfected to 3T3L-1 adipocytes. The strong promoter and enhancer sequences in the constructs drove similar levels of luciferase mRNA expression under all conditions, as illustrated by the typical gel in Fig. 6E. Thus, the changes in luciferase activity observed with the leptin UTR-luciferase constructs were due to the altered levels of translation of the reporter. Insertion of 5′-UTR of leptin upstream of luciferase coding region (5′-UTR/pGL3) increased luciferase activity 2–3-fold over the pGL3 control (n = 5, p < 0.001, Fig. 6C). The 5′-UTR was also stimulatory when inserted to a vector containing the leptin 3′-UTR in the downstream of luciferase coding region (Fig. 6D). Taken together, these data indicate that the leptin 5′-UTR includes positive cis element (s). Insertion of the entire leptin 3′-UTR (1–2804) downstream of the luciferase in the control vector (3′-UTR/pGL3) and in a construct with the leptin 5′-UTR (5′-3′-UTR/pGL3) decreased luciferase activity by 50% (n = 5, p < 0.01) and 65%, respectively (p < 0.01, n = 4), as compared with appropriate controls (Fig. 6, C and D). Thus, negative element(s) in 3′-UTR suppressed luciferase activity independent of elements in the leptin 5′-UTR. To determine the location of these negative elements, 3′-UTR constructs that deleted AU-rich regions (Fig. 6A) with predicted secondary structure were tested. Removal of sequences in the leptin 3′-UTR distal to nucleotide 1130, (1–1130, 5′-3′ΔUTR/pGL3) significantly decreased the magnitude of the inhibitory effect from 65% (full-length 3′-UTR) to only 35%. A construct with only the proximal 1–462 of the leptin 3′-UTR (5′-3′ΔΔUTR/pGL3) was ineffective in suppressing luciferase activity. Thus, we concluded that elements between nucleotides 462 and 1130 were largely responsible for the suppressive effect of the leptin 3′-UTR on reporter activity but that more distal elements also played a role. Similar negative effects on luciferase activity were obtained when we used the truncated 3′-UTR in constructs that did not include the leptin 5′-UTR upstream of LUC coding region (data not shown). Insulin Increased the Luciferase Activity of the 3′-UTR Inhibitory Constructs—To determine whether the 5′-UTR and/or 3′-UTR was important for the insulin stimulation of leptin translation, the transfected cells were serum deprived for 1 h and then treated with or without insulin for 3 h before harvesting. Insulin increased LUC activity of the reporter constructs 5′-3′-UTR/pGL3 (+82%, n = 4, p < 0.001) and 5′-3′ΔUTR/pGL3 (+30%, n = 4, p < 0.05). In contrast, insulin did not affect the LUC activity driven by the control vector, 5′-UTR/pGL3, 3′-UTR/pGL3, and 5′-3′ΔΔUTR/pGL3. Insulin Effects on Luciferase Activity Were Blocked by Inhibition of PI3K or mTOR—To provide direct evidence that the insulin effect on leptin translation involved activation of PI3K and mTOR, 3T3L-1 adipocytes were transfected with the full-length (3′-5′-UTR-LUC) and treated with or without insulin in the absence or presence of inhibitors of these pathways overnight (16 h). Insulin increased the expression of LUC activity by 2.5-fold, and these effects were blocked with the inhibitor treatments (Fig. 7). We provide several lines of evidence that increases in leptin production with feeding are due to increased rates of translation of leptin mRNA and that insulin is an important regulator of leptin mRNA translation. First, despite only modestly higher (+22%) levels of leptin mRNA in adipose tissue of fed as compared with starved rats, relative rates of leptin biosynthesis, leptin content, and leptin release were 4–5-fold higher. The effect of starvation on leptin biosynthesis was specific as rates of LPL biosynthesis were unaffected (14Lee J.J. Smith P.J. Fried S.K. J. Nutr. 1998; 128: 940-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Furthermore, feeding shifted leptin mRNA into the polysome fractions, indicating an increase in translational initiation. Finally, studies of chimeric constructs established that the insulin stimulation of leptin translation occurs by derepression and requires the presence of both 5′-UTRs and 3′-UTRs. Consistent with the hypothesis that increases in insulin levels with feeding contribute to the higher leptin synthesis, we found that in vitro treatment of adipose tissue with insulin increased relative rates of leptin biosynthesis without altering leptin mRNA levels. Our metabolic labeling results show that the insulin-induced increase in leptin biosynthesis was specific as the magnitude of the effect far exceeded its small effect on overall protein synthesis. Furthermore, we found that pharmacologic inhibitors of PI3K-mTOR signaling blocked the insulin effect. Bradley and Cheatham (6Bradley R.L. Cheatham B. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 272-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) reached a similar conclusion with studies of leptin release from isolated adipocytes, but they did not directly measure leptin biosynthesis. We also noted that the ability of insulin to stimulate relative rates of leptin biosynthesis was quite robust (200–300%) as compared with its effect on LPL biosynthesis (only 60–70%), suggesting that the mechanisms involved differ. Since inhibition of PI3K also blocks the insulin effect on LPL synthesis (18Kraemer F.B. Takeda D. Natu V. Sztalryd C. Metab. Clin. Exp. 1998; 47: 555-559Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), further work is needed to establish the mechanisms involved in the nutritional regulation of the synthesis of these two key adipocyte secretory proteins. The 5′-UTR of leptin mRNA is relatively short (56 bp) but is conserved between species (74% between mouse and human, 93% between mouse and rats). Recently, Kandror and colleagues (5Roh C. Han J.R. Tzatsos A. Kandror K.V. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: E322-E330Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) suggested a potential secondary structure in 5′-UTR of mouse and human leptin mRNAs. We also confirmed with the KineFold program that there is a potential pseudoknot in the 5′-UTR of human leptin mRNA. Although in many cases, 5′-UTR secondary structure inhibits translation (19Manzella J.M. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11817-11822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we observed that the 5′-UTR of leptin increased LUC activity 2–3-fold without any apparent effect on luciferase mRNA levels. A stimulatory effect of secondary structure in 5′-UTR on translational efficiencies of apoB (20Pontrelli L. Sidiropoulos K.G. Adeli K. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 6734-6744Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and heat shock protein 70 (21Vivinus S. Baulande S. van Zanten M. Campbell F. Topley P. Ellis J.H. Dessen P. Coste H. Eur. J Biochem. 2001; 268: 1908-1917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) has been previously observed, but the mechanisms involved are not understood. We speculate that the potential secondary structure or cis element in 5′-UTR of leptin may provide binding sites for eukaryotic translation initiation factors or other RNA-binding proteins that promote formation of translation initiation complexes. In contrast to the activating effect of 5′-UTR, the 3′-UTR significantly inhibited translational efficiency. The 3′-UTR of leptin mRNA extends 3 kb from the stop codon and has multiple potential structured elements (7Zhang Y. Proenca R. Maffei M. Barone M. Leopold L. Friedman J.M. Nature. 1994; 372: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (11668) Google Scholar).3 Analysis with the KineFold program suggested the existence of several strong stem-loop regions, between nucleotides 462–1130 and between 1130 and 2804 of 3′-UTR. These sequences are highly conserved (over 70% homology) between human and mouse. When the nucleotides between 462 and 2804 of 3′-UTR were deleted, the inhibitory effect was completely abolished, whereas deletion of nucleotides between 1130 and 2804 was partially inhibitory. Thus, our data suggest that the 3′-UTR of leptin contains several negative elements. Although the 3′-UTR of leptin does not contain clustered AUUUA sequences as in the 3′-UTR of many other cytokine genes (22Kruys V. Huez G. Biochimie (Paris). 1994; 76: 862-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), we noted several individual AUUUA motifs and one UUAUUUAUU nonamer that are conserved between human and mouse in the 3′-UTR of leptin (Fig. 6A). Although the leptin 3′-UTR does not include typical strong AU-rich elements, studies of AU-rich elements in the COX2 3′-UTR indicate that such elements are nevertheless capable of modulating translational efficiency and mRNA stability (23Cok S.J. Morrison A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23179-23185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Overall, our data suggest that feeding, at least in part through the action of insulin, increases the translation of leptin mRNA. Insulin may increase the translational efficiency of leptin mRNA by post-translational modification or de novo synthesis of a factor, or factors, that interact with the leptin UTRs. Further work is needed to define the cis elements that modulate leptin mRNA translation in response to alterations in nutritional state and to identify any RNA binding proteins involved. In summary, metabolic labeling and polysome profile studies demonstrate that feeding, at least in part through insulin, causes a specific increase in leptin translation. Studies of the expression of chimeric constructs showed the essential roles of the leptin 5′- and 3′-UTRs in the control leptin mRNA translation and in mediating the stimulation by insulin. Although insulin also increases leptin secretion per se (4Attoub S. Levasseur S. Buyse M. Goiot H. Laigneau J.P. Moizo L. Hervatin F. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Lewin J.M. Bado A.

Diabetes. 1999; 48: 272-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), the magnitude of the effect of insulin on translation that we observed suggests that it is the main mechanism responsible for the higher tissue leptin content and release in adipose tissue from the young, insulin-sensitive rats that we studied herein.

However, the detailed structures of the bent DNA and the p53-DNA complex are still unavailable, hampering our understanding of the mechanism for p53-induced DNA bending and its consequent biological significance. To gain insight into the p53 binding-induced DNA bending, we performed molecular dynamics simulations on DNA segments with the consensus sequence for p53-specific binding, half site DNA-p53 complexes, and full site DNA-p53 complexes. We show that each DNA-bound p53 core domain caused a local DNA conformational change within the quarter site; upon the binding of the p53 dimer, there was an apparent DNA bending at the center of the half site; when bound with two p53 dimers, the full site DNAs with two different sequences bent 20 and 35°, respectively. These results are in agreement with experimental observations. Our simulations demonstrate that the two p53 dimers favored a staggered conformation in which they make favorable interactions at the interface. This dimer-dimer interface organization necessitated conformational changes in the DNA, leading to the bending at the center of the full site, which in turn is dependent on the DNA sequence. Overall, our results provide the detailed atomic model for the DNA-p53 tetramer complex and delineate the roles of DNA-p53, p53 dimer-dimer interactions, and DNA sequence in specific p53 binding-induced DNA conformational changes.

In response to cellular stress such as DNA damage, tumor suppressor p53 is activated and functions as a transactivator to regulate several genes, preventing the development of cancer (1Kastan M.B. Onyekwere O. Sidransky D. Vogelstein B. Craig R.W. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 6304-6311PubMed Google Scholar, 2Vousden K.H. Biochim. Biophys.

Cancer Biol. 1998; 8: 345-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). A critical biochemical event for the p53 transactivation activity is its sequence-specific binding to DNA (5Bargonetti J. Friedman P.N. Kern S.E. Vogelstein B. Prives C. Cell. 1991; 65: 1083-1091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). p53 binding sites are usually composed of two 10-base pair (bp) repeats 5′-PuPuPuC(A/T) (A/T)GPyPyPy-3′, where Pu and Py stand for purine and pyrimidine bases, respectively (6Balagurumoorthy P. Sakamoto H. Lewis M.S. Zambrano N. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Appella E. Harrington R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8591-8595Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 7el-Deiry W.S.

Chem. 2002; 101-102: 611-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar); the two repeats can be separated by as many as 13 base pairs (7el-Deiry W.S. Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1758) Google Scholar, 9Funk W.D. Pak D.T. Karas R.H. Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Mol. Cell Biol. 1992; 12: 2866-2871Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). More than 100 different specific p53 response elements in the human genome that satisfy the consensus have been characterized (7el-Deiry W.S. Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1758) Google Scholar). The variance of the DNA sequence and the consequent difference in p53 binding affinity were suggested to be important in deciding which target gene to activate. The p53 protein is a tetramer of four homologous peptide chains, with each chain composed of several domains including the N-terminal domain that regulates the p53 transactivation activity (10Fields S. Jang S.K. Science. 1990; 249: 1046-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar), the specific DNA-binding core domain (11Cho Y. Gorina S. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1994; 265: 346-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar), the tetramerization domain (12Clore G.M. Omichinski J.G. Sakaguchi K. Zambrano N. Sakamoto H. Appella E. Gronenborn A.M. Science. 1994; 265: 386-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) that allows the equilibration between the tetrameric and other conformational states, and the C-terminal domain. It was shown that during the specific p53-DNA binding process, p53 first binds to the DNA non-specifically and then diffuses along the linear DNA duplex until it reaches the target sequence where the p53 core domain interacts with the DNA specifically (13McKinney K. Mattia M. Gottifredi V. Prives C. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). As a result, DNA experiences conformational changes such as axial bending (14Nagaich A.K. Appella E. Harrington R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14842-14849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 15Nagaich A.K. Zhurkin V.B. Durell S.R. Jernigan R.L. Appella E. Harrington R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Biol. 2006; 357: 442-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Such a specific binding process has been shown to be highly cooperative in that both the oligomerization of p53 and the presence of the full p53 binding site are required (18Weinberg R.L. Veprintsev D.B. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 341: 1145-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 19Stenger J.E. Tegtmeyer P. Mayr G.A. Reed M. Wang Y. Wang P. Hough P.V. Mastrangelo I.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6011-6020Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The binding of the half site only or of the altered full site is very weak and non-cooperative (18Weinberg R.L.

These specific ways of association between p53 and DNA and between p53 monomers are supported by several experiments (24Klein C. Planker E. Diercks T. Kessler H. Kunkele K.P. Lang K. Hansen S.

Engl. 2005; 44: 5247-5251Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Alternatively, p53 core domain dimerization interface in a crystal structure was also examined to explore their biological relevance (28Ma B. Pan Y. Gunasekaran K. Venkataraghavan R.B. Levine A.J. Nussinov R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 3988-3993Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Overall, there are little experimental data with respect to the association between the p53 dimers. Model building by mapping the four p53 domains onto the straight DNA consensus sequence suggested that such a dimer arrangement would incur some steric conflict between the dimers (23Nagaich A.K. Zhurkin V.B. Sakamoto H. Gorin A.A. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Appella E. Harrington R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14830-14841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). As a result, the DNA has to bend as much as 50° to avoid direct repulsion and to allow favorable interactions between the p53 dimers (23Nagaich A.K. Zhurkin V.B. Sakamoto H. Gorin A.A. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Appella E. Harrington R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14830-14841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Recently, a crystal structure of two p53 dimer half site DNA stacked side by side was solved (29Kitayner M. Rozenberg H. Kessler N. Rabinovich D. Shaulov L. Haran T.E. Shakked Z. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 741-753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), showing the staggered interface between the dimers of p53. However, because the oligonucleotides used in the experiment are not continuous, the dimer-dimer interface incurred in the corresponding complex does not warrant the same organization when a continuous full site DNA is applied. To gain insight into the p53-DNA interactions and the consequent DNA conformational changes, we systematically studied the structural properties of DNA alone, DNA-p53 monomer (DNA-p53m), DNA-p53 dimer (DNA-p53d), and DNA-p53 tetramer (DNA-p53t) complexes with molecular dynamics simulations based on the symmetric model. We show that the binding of the p53 monomer or dimer caused the DNA to bend at the center of the half sites. Upon the binding of dimer of dimers, the DNA bend 20 and 35° for two different DNA sequences, respectively, in qualitative agreement with the bending extent observed experimentally and consistent with other modeling results (30Lebrun A. Lavery R. Weinstein H. Protein Eng. 2001; 14: 233-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The simulations results reveal that the two p53 dimers in the DNA-bound state adopted a slightly shifted conformation that allows the favorable interactions and packing at the p53 dimer-dimer interface and results in the bending of DNA. Model Construction—DNA alone and DNA-p53 complexes with one, two, and four copies of the p53 core domain were investigated in this study. All molecular models were derived from the crystal structure (Protein Data Bank code 1TSR) (11Cho Y. Gorina S. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1994; 265: 346-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar). The DNA segment and the B chain of p53 in the crystal structure that was bound to DNA specifically were directly extracted from the Protein Data Bank file as the DNA-p53 monomer model (DNA-p53m; Fig. 1A); the DNA-p53 dimer complex (DNA-p53d) was constructed by superimposing the base pairs from two copies of the DNA-p53m complex in reverse order and in a way that the superposition resulted in a DNA double helix with the two copies of p53 bound to two consecutive quarter sites of the DNA (Fig. 1B). The resulting DNA-p53 dimer complex (DNA-p53d) structure ensures the specific DNA-p53 binding and that the two copies of p53 have a C2 symmetry, with formation of the salt bridges between the H1 helices. The DNA-p53 tetramer (DNA-p53t) model was constructed by merging two copies of DNA-p53d such that the resulting DNA segment has a continuous p53 binding full site with no base pair insertions and the two dimers of p53 are side by side (Fig. 1C). Although other ways of p53 tetramer-DNA complex organizations are possible, the model used here focused only on the type of organization where the dimers are symmetrically positioned on the DNA with respect to each other, with each monomer bound to the DNA specifically, as observed in the crystal structure (11Cho Y. Gorina S. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1994; 265: 346-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar). The DNA sequence for the DNA-p53m and DNA-p53d complex simulation is 5′-ATTGGGCA AGTCTAGG-3′, extracted from the crystal structure. For the DNA-p53t complex simulations two DNA sequences were used, 5′-ATAATTGGGCA AGTCT∥GGGCA AGTCTAGGAA-3′, or the Cho sequence (11Cho Y. Gorina S. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1994; 265: 346-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar), and 5′-ATAATTGAGCA TGCTC∥GAGCA TGCTCAGGAA-3′, or the Ho sequence (31Ho W.C. Fitzgerald M.X. Marmorstein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 20494-20502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) with the base pairs for p53 binding site in bold. The second DNA-p53t model was obtained by mutating the base pairs in the first DNA-p53t model into the sequence used in previous experimental work (31Ho W.C. Fitzgerald M.X. Marmorstein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 20494-20502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). MD Simulation Protocol—Each system was first solvated with a TIP3P water box (32Jorgensen W.L.

Solvent molecules within 1.6 Å of DNA or 2.5 Å of protein were removed. The systems were then neutralized by adding either sodium or chloride ions. The resulting systems were then subjected to a series of minimizations and equilibrations before the production of MD 2The abbreviation used is: MD, molecular dynamics. simulations with the CHARMM program (33Brooks B.R.

Minimizations were first performed for 500 steps with the steepest decent algorithm with the backbone of the core domain constrained and an additional 500 steps for the whole system to reduce the unfavorable interactions. The systems were further pre-equilibrated for 20 ps with the NVT ensemble before the production simulations, which lasted for 10 ns with the NPT ensemble at temperatures of 300 K. Periodic boundary conditions were applied, and the non-bonded lists were updated every 20 steps. A time step of 2 fs and a nonbonded cutoff of 12 Å were used in the trajectory production. Electrostatic energies were calculated with the PME algorithm implemented in Charmm, and the order of 6 was specified for B-spline interpolation. Structures were saved every 2 ps for analysis. DNA Intrinsic Properties and Conformational Changes upon p53 Binding—The 15-base pair DNA containing the consensus sequence (half site) was subjected to MD simulations by itself, in complex with one p53 core domain (DNA-p53m; Fig. 1A), and in complex with two p53 core domains (DNA-p53d; Fig. 1B). These simulations were designed to investigate the intrinsic DNA conformational preferences and the conformational changes upon p53 binding in the context of the half p53 binding site. Fig. 2 shows the DNA conformations for the three cases. The DNA apparently preferred a double helical conformation with a straight axis when it was not in complex with p53 (Fig. 2A). When DNA was in complex with either one or two p53 core domains, the axis of the DNA became slightly yet noticeably bent (Fig. 2, B and C). Only the quarter site that was bound with p53 in the DNA-p53m complex was bent, and both quarter sites were bent in the DNA-p53d complex. More specifically, the bending was located at the base pair that was absolutely conserved in the consensus sequence, corresponding to the 4th and 7th positions of the half site (indicated by small arrows in Fig. 2). The DNA bending caused by the binding of two p53 core domains was consistent with the experimental findings (31Ho W.C. Fitzgerald M.X. Marmorstein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 20494-20502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). A view through the DNA axis further reveals the deformation of the DNA. In free DNA, the double helix adopted a regular round shape, as expected. However, the double helical DNA took an oval-like shape when in complex with two p53 core domains (Fig. 2). This is reminiscent of the clamp-like action by the p53 dimer proposed earlier with the salt bridges between the H1 helices as a hinge. These results suggest that the interactions between p53 and the conserved G base at the 4th (upper chain G base) and 7th (lower chain G base) positions within the consensus sequence played a major role in triggering the DNA conformational changes. However, it should be noted that the extent of DNA bending was quite limited. Analysis of the DNA helical parameters further revealed the details of the DNA conformational changes upon p53 binding. Compared with the parameters of free DNA, it is noticeable that the major groove width became larger at the quarter site that was bound with p53, particularly at the 4th position (supplemental Fig. S1A, red) whereas the major groove depth became shallower at the 3rd and 4th positions in the first quarter site (supplemental Fig. S1B, red). The changes in the minor groove parameters showed opposite trends compared with those of the major groove. Note that the minor groove parameters for both quarter sites were affected by the binding of one p53 core domain. The effect on the second quarter site was likely caused by the interactions of Arg-248 and other residues (Fig. 1A). Overall, the difference in the helical parameters between free DNA and p53-bound DNA was correlated with the specific interactions between the DNA and p53, particularly the p53 interactions of Arg-280 with the G base at the 4th and 7th positions. These specific interactions seemed to have resulted in the major groove narrowing near the center of the half site. Key Interactions Responsible for the DNA Conformational Changes—To further characterize the important interactions between DNA and p53, the specific interactions between the DNA and p53 (B chain) in the crystal structure (11Cho Y. Gorina S. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1994; 265: 346-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar) were analyzed first. Next, each of the base pairs in the consensus sequence were substituted with the other three bases, one position at a time with the conformation of the DNA retained, and the interactions re-evaluated for the mutants. These data were then compared with the results from the MD simulations for the DNA-p53 complexes. The interaction energies for each base pair of the DNA consensus sequence with the p53 monomer in the crystal structure are shown in Fig. 3A. In this conformation, base pairs 1-5 and 6-10 were in contact with p53 through the major groove and minor groove, respectively. The interaction energies for the base pairs interacting through the major groove (bp 1-5) were in general more favorable than the corresponding energies for base pairs interacting through the minor groove (bp 6-10). Among the five base pairs of the first quarter site, the 2nd and 4th base pairs, which were second mostly and absolutely conserved, respectively (7el-Deiry W.S. Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1758) Google Scholar), were sensitive to base pair replacement (Fig. 3A). When the pyrimidine base C at the 4th position was replaced with the other pyrimidine base T that is geometrically similar to C, the interaction energy was not or only slightly affected (Fig. 3A). However, when replaced with a purine base A or G, the interaction energy became much less favorable. The specific interaction of this bp with p53, which involves hydrogen bonding between the side chains of Arg-280 and the G base from the other DNA strand, was described in detail previously (11Cho Y. Gorina S. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1994; 265: 346-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar). Similarly, the interaction of the G base at the 2nd position, which made specific interactions with Lys-120, was only slightly affected when replaced with the other purine base, A, and became much less favorable when substituted with either a C or T. The other three positions (1st, 3rd, and 5th) were not sensitive to mutations, because only the backbones of these base pairs interacted with p53 and the conformation was essentially unaltered. Among the five base pairs of the second quarter site (bp 6-10), the most favorable interactions were between base pairs at the 6th and 8th positions and Arg-248 of p53 (11Cho Y. Gorina S. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1994; 265: 346-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar). The crystal structure shows that Arg-248 interacts with the phosphate backbones of these nucleotides. The side chain of Arg-248 was partially buried in the minor groove at the 8th position (Fig. 1A). Our results show that mutations at these two positions did not alter the interaction energy, consistent with the nonspecific backbone interactions. Interestingly, the interactions of base pairs at the 7th and 9th positions of the second quarter site deviated from the crystal structure, especially for the base pair at the 9th position. However, it did not make much difference whether the base pairs were replaced with a purine base or a pyrimidine base. Therefore, such a deviation of the interaction energy upon mutation may be related to conformational perturbation, not the direct disruption of specific interactions or the outcome of the mutations. Next, the same interactions were analyzed from the molecular dynamics trajectories to compare their changes in the context of DNA-p53m and DNA-p53d complexes. Fig. 3B shows that only the interactions for base pairs at the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th positions essentially did not decrease. The strong interactions of the base pairs at the 2nd and 4th positions with p53 are supported by the high conservations and are consistent with the mutational results in Fig. 3A. These results demonstrate that the extensive interactions at the major groove, both specific interactions such as hydrogen bonding with the bases and nonspecific interactions with the backbones, helped maintain the strong interactions at the first quarter site; in contrast, because of the sparse contacts at the minor groove for the second site, these interactions were fragile and susceptible to changes in the environment. When DNA was bound to a p53 dimer, almost all the interactions became more favorable (Fig. 3B, green) relative to those for the DNA-p53m complex, suggesting that the dimerization, which was mediated by the salt bridge in the H1 helix motif, may have augmented the interactions between the DNA and each p53 monomer. The simulation results confirm that the interactions at the major groove were dominant and more stable than the interactions at the minor groove. DNA Bending—As described under “Materials and Methods,” the starting structure of the DNA in complex with four p53 core domains was almost linear (Fig. 4A). Each of the four copies of the p53 core domains binds specifically to a DNA quarter site of the 20-bp consensus sequence. For the complex with the Cho DNA sequence, after ∼4.5 ns of production MD simulations, the DNA became bent with a bending angle of 20° (Fig. 4B). Further DNA bending was not observed in the simulation trajectory that was extended to 10 ns. In a parallel simulation with the Ho sequence of DNA, similar DNA conformational changes were observed (Fig. 4C). However, the DNA bending happened earlier with a much higher bending extent of 35° at 7.5 ns. This extent of DNA bending was maintained for the rest of the simulation trajectory. The magnitude of DNA bending observed here is in qualitative agreement with the experimental measurement for the p53 core domain-induced DNA bending, which could span a range from 20 to 45° under different conditions. In addition, the bending extents of the two DNAs also correlate with the different DNA flexibilities corresponding to the CAAG and CATG sequences at the middle of the half site. To better characterize the DNA bending properties, the DNA helical parameters for the free DNA, constrained DNA, and the DNAs bound to the p53 tetramer were compared (supplemental Fig. S2). The 31-base pair-free DNA simulation (without constraint) yielded similar helical parameters across the 20-base pair consensus sequence (supplemental Fig. S2, black), which was typical for B-form DNA conformations. This result was expected but different from those of the shorter DNA simulations described earlier, indicating that the simulations can better reproduce the DNA conformational properties when a longer DNA segment is used. The helical parameters for the force-bent DNA show clear patterns of changes similar to the mathematical sine or cosine functions (supplemental Fig. S2, green). Interestingly, the peaks and the valleys for each of these parameters were one or two bases shifted from the centers of the half sites. Comparison between those from the MD simulations of the DNA-p53t complex and those from the DNA that was bent by force showed a similar pattern for major groove parameters, particularly the major groove depth (supplemental Fig S2B). Because the parameters for the DNA bent by force were averaged over bending angles from 0 to 90° while the DNA bound with the p53 tetramer was only bent to a smaller extent, the differences in magnitude of the parameters were expected. However, the consistency in patterns between the major groove parameters for DNA bent by force and DNA bound with the p53 tetramer shows that the DNA preferred to bend at or near the centers of each half site for this particular binding site sequence (supplemental Fig. S2, A and B). For the minor groove, the pattern revealed in the force-bent DNA was not observed in the complex simulation, especially for the minor groove depth. In both simulation cases, the minor groove depth increased at the middle of the full site (supplemental Fig. S2D, red and blue). Given the short duration of the simulation and the weak interactions at the minor groove side, the discrepancy between the minor groove parameters was likely to be caused by the insufficient convergence. To confirm that the DNA bending results from the forced bending and the DNA bending from the DNA-p53 complex simulations are reasonable, we compared them with data obtained for a representative DNA segment from a DNA loop crystal structure when bound with proteins (35Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (7046) Google Scholar). In this DNA segment the bending angle is ∼60° (Fig. 5). The major groove parameters for this bent DNA were very similar to those of the DNA bent by force, not only in magnitude but also in patterns of changes, supporting the results obtained from the force-induced DNA bending. The crystal structure of the bent DNA clearly shows that the region bent the most corresponded to base pairs with the deepest major groove (Fig. 5). In the DNA-p53t complex model, this corresponds to positions near the center of the half sites, consistent with the notion that the A/T-rich regions have the tendency to bend. Thus, the observed DNA conformational change in our simulations was reasonable. p53 Dimer-Dimer Interactions—The two dimers of p53 sat on the DNA side by side in the starting structure of the complex for the simulation (Fig. 4A). Because canonical B-form DNA takes 10.5 base pairs to make a complete helical turn, two dimers bound to two consecutive 10-bp half sites will assume a slightly staggered conformation with the front dimer shifted to the right with respect to the second dimer (Fig. 4A, right panel). After 4.5 ns of dynamics simulation for the complex with the Cho DNA sequence, the front dimer shifted further in the same direction (Fig. 4B). The dimer-dimer interface apparently preferred a slightly staggered conformation that allowed the dimers to associate favorably without steric conflict between the contacting monomers across the interface. Consistently, the conformational change in this regard was the same for the complex with the Ho DNA sequence (Fig. 4C). When viewed through the dimer-dimer interface, it can be seen that in the starting structure, the dimer-dimer interface on both sides was relatively loose (Fig. 6A). Comparing with the starting conformation, the left side of the interface became tighter while the right side of the interface changed little for the complex involving the Cho DNA sequence (Fig. 6B); however, both sides of the interface became nicely packed when the Ho DNA sequence was used (Fig. 6C). It is also visible that the DNA at the center was more compressed for the Ho sequence than for the Cho sequence (data not shown). These results show that the DNA flexibility was important for the p53 dimers to optimize the interactions while maintaining the specific binding to the DNA. Fig. 7 further shows the atomic details for half of the p53 dimer-dimer interface, representing both cases. The concavity at the joint of turn S7S8 and loop L1 from the top monomer complemented well the molecular contour of the bottom monomers at loop L2, turn S5S6, and the N terminus, with the atomic details showing the favorable interactions. The interaction energies between the p53 dimers for both complexes were also calculated (Fig. 8A). In both cases, the interaction energy seems to reach equilibrium after ∼4 ns of simulation. On the other hand, the interaction energies between p53 and the central 4 base pairs were very different (Fig. 8B). When the system was equilibrated after 6 ns into the trajectory, the interaction energy was much more favorable for the complex involving the Ho DNA sequence than for the complex involving the Cho sequence, indicating the tight packing between the DNA and protein in the former case.FIGURE 8Interaction energy (kcal/mol) changes over the 10-ns trajectories between p53 dimers (A) and between p53 and the four base pairs at the center of the half site (B). The interactions between the p53 dimers became more favorable overall while the interactions between p53 and DNA became less favorable compared with that in the starting conformation. The more favorable p53-DNA interaction for the Ho sequence indicates the tighter packing than in the complex with the Cho sequence. The interaction energy was calculated with the Charmm program using distance-dependent dielectric constant with a coefficient of 4 and a cutoff of 12 Å for non-bonded interactions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Tetramer Modeling—We have shown that the forced DNA bending conformations were consistent with the structural parameters of bent DNA conformations from the data base. On the other hand, our simulations were able to observe only moderate DNA bending and a p53 dimer-dimer interface shift from the starting conformation. Experimentally it was shown that the bending can be much larger, particularly in the context of the full-length p53 protein. To bridge this missing link, we attempted to manually dock the p53 tetramer onto the specific DNA consensus site using the DNA conformation that was force bent by ∼45°. Fig. 9 shows the docked organization of the complex. Here, we assumed that the specific interaction between p53 and the DNA at the major groove is retained in the DNA bent conformations. Thus, the docked conformation was unique, given the constraints that were imposed for the specific interactions at the major groove. When the dimer-dimer interface in the docked conformation is placed parallel to the surface of the paper, the staggered organization of the p53 dimers is clearly visible (Fig. 9B) and is consistent with the simulated DNA-p53t complex conformation (Fig. 4, B and C). Thus, our combined simulation and docking results suggest that the observed p53 tetramer-DNA complex model is biologically relevant. The stability of the complex depends on many factors including the DNA sequence (36Nadeau J.G. Crothers D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2622-2626Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), the length of the DNA segment, whether full-length p53 protein or its core domains were involved, and possibly the conformational changes within the p53 monomer. The fact that full-length p53 can trigger a larger extent of DNA bending clearly demonstrates the involvement of other protein parts in maintaining the stability of the bent DNA. Thus, the docked conformation may be more relevant to the full-length p53-induced complex structure while the simulation-derived structure corresponds better to the core domain-triggered DNA bending. P53 Tetramer-DNA Organization—The p53 tetramer-DNA complex structure and its associated properties have been the focus of several groups in recent years. Unfortunately, no model for the organization of the complex is presented so far with reasonable validation. Recently, a crystal structure of four p53 core domains assembled on two half-site DNA was solved (29Kitayner M. Rozenberg H. Kessler N. Rabinovich D. Shaulov L. Haran T.E. Shakked Z. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 741-753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), shedding light on the organization of the complex. However, the biological relevance of this structure needs further validation because of the discontinuity of the DNA. If the p53 dimers do bind to the DNA in a specific manner, which was supported by abundant experimental evidence, then the p53 dimers in the DNA-bound state can arguably have only two ways of organization with respect to each other: one of the p53 dimer shifts toward the right, as observed in our simulations (Fig. 4, B and C), or it moves to the left, as implied in the crystal structure (29Kitayner M. Rozenberg H. Kessler N. Rabinovich D. Shaulov L. Haran T.E. Shakked Z. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 741-753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Our simulation results, particularly the initial structure in which the two dimers take a slightly staggered conformation due to the 10.5-bp/turn DNA property, the correlation between the DNA bending extent and the DNA sequence, and the observed tight packing and interaction along the p53 dimer interface, strongly suggest that our proposed model is relevant to biological functions."
https://openalex.org/W1981450367,"In this study, we established that collagen gel, but not collagen gel coating, induced apoptosis exclusively in epithelial cell lines, which indicated that low substratum rigidity might trigger cell apoptosis. To confirm this, we used collagen gels with different rigidities due to cross-linking or physical disruption of collagen fibrils caused by sonication. We found that collagen gel-induced apoptosis was inversely correlated with substratum rigidity. Low substratum rigidity collagen gel-induced apoptosis was neither prevented by Bcl-2 overexpression nor preceded by mitochondrial release of cytochrome c. This suggested that the mitochondrial pathway was not involved in low substratum rigidity-induced apoptosis. Low substratum rigidity activated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) within 4 h, but it also rapidly down-regulated c-Jun within 1 h and triggered persistent aberrant expression of c-Fos for at least 24 h. Either reduced c-Jun expression or c-Fos overexpression induced apoptosis in several epithelial cells. Inhibiting low substratum rigidity-induced JNK activation prevented aberrant c-Fos expression but only partially blocked low substratum rigidity-induced apoptosis. Taking these results together, we conclude that low substratum rigidity collagen gel induced apoptosis in epithelial cells and that deregulated AP-1 proteins mediated that apoptosis, at least in part.

In addition, a micro-fabrication strategy to generate micrometer-scale rods of an elastomeric polymer, polydimethylsiloxane, was used to study the traction force generated by cells (7Tan J.L. Tien J.

Fibril collagen is the most abundant extracellular matrix in normal interstitium. Due to its fibril nature, collagen gel is the most commonly used three-dimensional scaffolding material for biological studies.

To prepare collagen gel with different physical properties, we extracted collagen from the tail tendons of rats of different ages, and then we modified the collagen gel rigidity using sonication (15Betsch D.F.

Collagen gel is a viscoelastic material with non-linear elasticity whose shear mechanical properties are assessable using a rheometer, a well established tool (17Hsu S. Jamieson A.M. Blackwell J.

To elucidate the signal mechanism underlying low substratum rigidity-induced epithelial cell death, we investigated the traditional cell-death pathway. The mitochondrial pathway did not seem to be involved, however. On the other hand, we found that low substratum rigidity activated the JNK group of MAP kinases, also known as stress-activated protein kinases. Previous studies (19Minden A. Lin A. Smeal T. Derijard B. Cobb M. Davis R. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6683-6688Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 20Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J.

Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1710) Google Scholar) reported that the JNK protein kinases phosphorylated transcriptional activation domains of the AP-1 family proteins. The AP-1 family consists of several groups of bZIP domain (bZIP is basic region leucine zipper) proteins: the Jun, Fos, and ATF-2 subfamilies (22Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3279) Google Scholar). C-Jun overexpression induced apoptosis in 3T3 fibroblasts (23Bossy-Wetzel E. Bakiri L. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1695-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). In addition, JNK/c-Jun signaling was necessary for the apoptotic response in certain neuronal cell types (24Watson A.

Biol. 1999; 19: 751-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). On the other hand, c-Jun knock-out mouse embryonic fibroblast cells exhibited defects in proliferation and increases in UV-induced apoptosis (26Behrens A. Sibilia M. Wagner E.F. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 326-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar, 27Wisdom R. Johnson R.S. Moore C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 188-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Consistent with cell culture studies, the lack of c-Jun resulted in massive apoptosis of hepatoblasts and erythroblasts in the developing mouse liver in vivo (28Eferl R. Sibilia M. Hilberg F.

The c-fos proto-oncogene, the other major AP-1 protein member, encoded a nuclear protein that dimerized with Jun family proteins (29Ryder K. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Oncogene. 1993; 8: 387-393PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to a primary role in normal development and cellular growth, c-Fos protein has been associated with apoptotic cell death induced by anti-proliferative conditions (36Colotta F. Polentarutti N. Sironi M. Mantovani A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18278-18283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Smeyne R.J. Vendrell M. Hayward M. Baker S.J. Miao G.G. Schilling K.

In this study, we explored the novel role of AP-1 deregulation in low rigidity collagen gel-induced epithelial cell apoptosis. Cell Lines and Cultures—MDCK, LLC-PK1, BS-C-1, NMuMG, NRK-52E, HK-2, HEK 293, and Chang liver cells were purchased from ATCC and regularly maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). BS-C-1 cells were cultured in modified Eagle's medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% FCS. HK-2 cells were cultured in MEM plus methanol-soluble factor with 5 ng/ml EGF, 40 ng/ml bovine pituitary extract and supplemented with 10% FCS. Chang liver cells were cultured in MEM supplemented with 10% FCS. Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) were a gift from Dr. Wen-Chan Chang, NIH/3T3 cells were a gift from Dr. Hsiao-Shen Liu, U-373MG were a gift from Dr. Jih-Ing Chaung, and four oral cancer cell lines (OC-2, DOK, SSC-25, and HSC-3) were gifts from Dr. Dar-Bin Shieh (all from National Cheng Kung University Medical College, Tainan, Taiwan). BAECs, NIH/3T3, and U-373MG cell lines were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS. OC-2 cells were cultured in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FCS. DOK cells were cultured in DMEM with 2 mm glutamine and 5 μg/ml hydro-cortisone and supplemented with 10% FCS. Preparation of Hydrated Collagen Gel—Type I collagen was prepared from rat tail tendons according to the established procedure (10Jiang S.T. Yang T.P. Huang J.J. Hsu C.C. Tang M.J. Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 1539-1548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 38McAteer J.A. Cavanagh T.J. J. Tissue Cult. Methods. 1982; 7: 117-122Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The final concentration of type I collagen stock was 1% (wet weight) dissolved in 0.025 n acetic acid. To prepare collagen gel, 3 vol of collagen stock was mixed with 5.7 × DMEM (1 vol), 2.5% NaHCO3 (0.5 vol), 0.1 m HEPES (1 vol), 0.17 m CaCl2 (0.1 vol), 1 n NaOH (0.1 vol), and 4.3 vol of 1× culture medium (DMEM plus 10% FCS) under chilled conditions. The mixture was dispensed on culture dishes and kept at room temperature to allow gelation. After gelation, each culture was overlaid with 2 ml of culture medium that was replaced every other day. To prepare collagen gel-coated dishes, collagen gel mixtures were dispensed in culture dishes and then aspirated to allow only a thin sheet of collagen to cover the dish. The collagen gel-coated dishes were semi-air-dried in a culture hood. Every culture plate was freshly prepared before it was used in an experiment. DNA Extraction and Electrophoresis—The method of extracting low molecular genomic DNA has been previously described (39Eastman A. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 46: 41-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Briefly, cultured cells were extracted with 0.5% Triton X-100, 10 mm EDTA, and 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4) and phenol/chloroform three times. The DNA was precipitated in propanol and electrophoresed in 1.5% agarose gel. Finally the DNA was visualized using ethidium bromide staining under UV light. Hoechst 33258 Staining and Assessing Nuclear Areas—LLC-PK1 cells cultured on culture dishes or collagen gel for 24 h were washed twice with PBS and then fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in the gel. After they had been washed, the cells were permeabilized using buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and then stained with Hoechst 33258 (5 mg/ml) for 1 h in the dark. Finally, the stained nuclei were visualized under a fluorescence microscope (BX-51, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). To assess nuclear areas, cells were cultured under different conditions for 24 h and subjected to Hoechst 33258 staining, and then the nuclear area was evaluated under a fluorescence microscope with imaging software (Image-Pro Plus 6.0, Media Cybernetics, Inc., Silver Spring, MD). Analysis of Apoptosis Ratio—The apoptosis ratio was assessed using flow cytometry with propidium iodide as previously described (8Lin H.H. Yang T.P. Jiang S.T. Yang H.Y. Tang M.J. Kidney Int. 1999; 55: 168-178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 12Tang M.J. Hu J.J. Lin H.H. Chiu W.T. Jiang S.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C921-C931Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After cells were seeded on collagen gel for different time periods, the gel was removed and treated with 0.2% collagenase at 37 °C for 10 min. The cell mixtures collected were washed with PBS and fixed in 70% alcohol. After fixation, the cells were treated with RNase (100 mg/ml PBS) and stained with propidium iodide (40 mg/ml PBS). The mixed cells were incubated in the dark at room temperature for 30 min and analyzed using flow cytometry (FACScan, BD Biosciences) with excitation set at 488 nm. Data were analyzed using CellQuest software. Western Blotting—We used the following antibodies to assess protein levels: caspase 2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), pro-caspase 3 (Upstate Biotechnology), Bcl-2 (DAKO), cytochrome c (BD Pharmingen), cleaved caspase 3 and caspase 9 (Cell Signaling Technology), caspase 8 (Oncogene), JNK and phosphorylated JNK (Cell Signaling), c-Jun (BD Transduction), c-Fos (Upstate Biotechnology), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Protein concentration was measured using the Lowry method (40Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 251: 165-175Google Scholar). For Western blotting, 30 or 50 μg of cell homogenate from specific samples was resolved using 10% SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically blotted onto nitrocellulose paper. The nitrocellulose paper was incubated with the specific antibody listed above, and then immunocomplexes were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG, and, finally, the immunocomplexes were made visible using fluorography with an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Treatment with Caspase or MAP Kinase Inhibitors—Cells were pretreated for 1 h and then seeded onto a culture dish, a collagen gel-coated dish, or on collagen gel with the caspase inhibitors z-VAD and DEVD-fmk (Calbiochem-Novabiochem) and JNK inhibitor SP600125 (Tocris). At various time points, cells were harvested and the apoptosis ratio was assessed using FACScan analysis. Scanning Electron Microscopy—LLC-PK1 cells cultured for 48 h on a dish with normal culture, a collagen gel-coated dish, or collagen gel were rinsed twice with PBS solution. The cells were fixed with 2% buffered paraformaldehyde for 1 h. After fixation, the cells were rinsed twice with PBS to remove paraformaldehyde. Samples were dehydrated using incubation with gradient alcohol from 50% to 95% for 10 min under each concentration. In the final step, absolute alcohol was used to complete dehydration three times for 5 min. Samples were critical point-dried in liquid CO2 solution and then coated with a thin layer of gold-particle film. Finally the samples were visualized under a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi S5200). Quantification of Collagen Gel Rigidity—The detailed protocol of the quantification of collagen gel rigidity was previously described (41Wu C.C. Ding S.J. Wang Y.H. Tang M.J. Chang H.C. J. Biomater. Sci. Polymer Edn. 2005; 16: 1261-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In brief, the viscoelastic properties of collagen gel were analyzed using a rheometer (AR1000, TA Instruments Ltd., West Sussex, UK) using cone-plate geometry with a 2° angle and a 60-mm diameter cone. To avoid the fracture of collagen gel and to increase the adhesion force between the collagen fiber network and the cone-plate geometry, neutralized collagen solution was first poured onto a pre-cooled plate disk at 5 °C, and then the cone was moved to approach the solution. After connecting the cone and solution, the temperature was shifted to 37 °C for 25 min to allow the collagen solution to gel. While we measured the viscoelasticity of the gel, the temperature was held at 25 °C. The dynamic shear storage modulus (G′), also called dynamic rigidity (42Barnes H.A. Hutton J.F. Walters K. An Introduction to Rheology. Elsevier Science, Amsterdam, The Netherlands1989Google Scholar), and loss modulus (G″) of gels were acquired with angular frequency ranging from 0.1 to 10 rads/s. The maximum strain was set at 5% according to the requirements, and as suggested (43Barocas V.H. Moon A.G. Tranquillo R.T. J. Biomech. Eng. 1995; 11: 164-170Google Scholar), of within a 10% linear viscoelastic range for shear measurements. Plasmid Constructs and Transfections—The cDNA encoding c-Jun or c-Fos was generated using PCR from a 1-month-old mouse-cerebrum cDNA library. Plasmid expressing full-length c-Jun or c-Fos was constructed using standard molecular cloning techniques. The expressing sequence was constructed by inserting pEGFP-N1 (BD Biosciences Clontech). To generate the EGFP expression vector, c-Jun/EGFP, the pEGFP-N1 was digested with EcoRI and HindIII. For c-Fos/EGFP vector, the pEGFP-N1 was digested with EcoRI and SacII. Plasmid was amplified in Escherichia coli using transfection and purified using plasmid extraction kits (Plasmid Midi Kit, Qiagen). Cells were transfected with c-Jun/EGFP, or c-Fos/EGFP plasmid using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Construction of an shRNA Expression System—Plasmid expressing shRNA was constructed using standard molecular cloning techniques. The pSUPER/EGFP-expressing enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) was constructed by inserting the EGFP expression cassette from pEGFP-N1 (BD Biosciences Clontech) into pSUPER vector (44Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3971) Google Scholar) (kindly provided by Dr. R. Agami, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). To generate the shRNA expression vector pSUPER-Mmc-Jun/EGFP, the pSUPER/EGFP was digested with BglII and HindIII, and an annealed oligonucleotide duplex against the sequence of 5′-CGCAGCAGTTGCAAACGTT-3′ for murine c-Jun (45Bhoumik A. Jones N. Ronai Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4222-4227Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) was ligated into the vector. Confocal Microscopy and Real-time Fluorescence Images—LLC-PK1, NMuMG, or HeLa cells were transiently transfected with EGFP-containing plasmid for the indicated time points. For a vital stain assay, cells were pre-stained with propidium iodide (200 μg/ml in culture medium) for 30 min before fixation. For fluorescence images, cells were rinsed twice with PBS solution, fixed with 4% buffered paraformaldehyde for 15 min, and then blocked with super blocking buffer (Pierce) for 1 h. To detect c-Jun expression, cells were stained with mouse anti-c-Jun antibody (BD transduction) for 1 h. Cells were rinsed five times with PBS. Finally, the cells were stained with anti-mouse IgG conjugated with Alexa 594 (Molecular Probes) for 1 h. The fluorophore was excited using a laser at 488 or 594 nm and detected at emission spectrum (520 or 640 nm) using a photo-multiplier with a ×40 water-immersion objective lens (HCX APO L ×40/0.90 W-U-V-1) for display as a high resolution image. Finally the stained results were visualized under a confocal microscope (SP-2, Leica Mikrosysteme Vertrieb GmbH, Bensheim, Germany). Images were taken using Leica SP-2 software. For time-lapse fluorescence recording, NMuMG cells were transiently transfected with shRNA-containing EGFP expression plasmid and recovered 4 h after transfection. The cells were moved from an incubator to a culture system on confocal microscopy (FV1000, Olympus), in which the temperature was kept at 37 ± 0.5 °C, and 5% CO2 was injected into PBS to maintain the CO2 concentration and moisture in the chamber. The EGFP was excited using an argon laser at 488 nm and detected at emission spectrum (520 nm) using a photo-multiplier with a ×40-inverted objective lens (Uplan Apo ×40/1.0 oil, Olympus) to display as a high resolution image for 10-min intervals (scan speed: 3.928 s/frame). Images were taken or composed (video) using imaging software (FV10-SW, Olympus). Statistics—All data are expressed as means ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments. One-way analysis of variance was used to test for statistical differences. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Characterization of LLC-PK1 Cell Death Induced by Fibril Collagen Gel—LLC-PK1 and HEK 293 cells were cultured for 24 h on normal culture dishes or 0.3% type I collagen gel prepared from the tail tendons of 1-month-old rats. Collagen gel did not alter the morphology of HEK 293 cells. However, LLC-PK1 cells cultured on collagen gel showed distinct morphological changes. These cells formed contracted cell islands with many disintegrated vesicles (Fig. 1A). An analysis of the DNA extracted from LLC-PK1 cells cultured on collagen gel showed a DNA ladder pattern, indicating that collagen gel-induced cell death was apoptosis (Fig. 1B). In addition, an assessment of the integrity of cell nuclei using Hoechst 33258 staining revealed nuclear condensation as well as fragmentation in LLC-PK1 cells cultured on collagen gel (Fig. 1C). The results of the FACScan analysis of the nuclear size also showed, after 48 h, a significantly (p < 0.001) increased (56.4 ± 9.8%) sub-G0 population in LLC-PK1 cells cultured on collagen gel, but only a <7% increase in cells cultured on a normal dish (Fig. 1D). To examine whether other types of extracellular matrix had similar effects, LLC-PK1 cells were cultured on dishes pretreated with fibronectin, laminin, vitronectin, or Matrigel for 48 h, and the apoptosis ratio was assessed. None of these extracellular matrices triggered apoptosis in LLC-PK1 cells (data not shown). However, when LLC-PK1 cells were cultured on 0.3% type III collagen gel for 48 h, they displayed approximately similar levels of apoptosis (Fig. 1E). Because both type I and type III collagen belong to the fibril collagen family, these data suggested that collagen gel-induced apoptosis may be caused by the physical nature of the three-dimensional gel. To determine whether collagen gel-induced apoptosis was cell-type specific, we cultured epithelial (NMuMG, BS-C-1, MDCK, and NRK-52E), endothelial (BAECs), mesenchymal (HEK 293 and NIH-3T3), and tumor cells (HK-2, Chang liver, U-373 MG, OC-2, DOK, SSC-25, and HSC-3) on type I collagen gel for 48 h and assessed the apoptosis ratio using FACScan analysis. We found that only polarized cells, including epithelial and endothelial cells, had elevated levels of apoptosis on collagen gel (Fig. 1F). In contrast, mesenchymal as well as tumor cells showed little apoptosis when they were cultured on collagen gel. Collagen Gel Coating Alleviated Collagen Gel-induced Apoptosis—To determine whether collagen gel-induced apoptosis in epithelial cells was caused by its physical or chemical nature, we used collagen gel-coated dishes that exerted a chemical impact similar to that of collagen gel but were physically quite rigid, as previously described (46Chen C.S. Mrksich M. Huang S. Whitesides G.M. Ingber D.E. Science. 1997; 276: 1425-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4216) Google Scholar). LLC-PK1 cells cultured on these dishes were mostly normal epithelial cell-shaped with reasonable extension. Although some of LLC-PK1 cells were elongated and became spindle-shaped, they were relatively more extended than the cells with retracted morphology induced by collagen gel (Fig. 2A, panels a-c). To investigate the cell morphology in more detail, we used an SEM. We found that cells grown on normal culture or collagen gel-coated dishes mostly spread well with little sign of apoptosis (Fig. 2A, panels d and e). In contrast, cells grown on collagen gel exhibited more limited extension and a significant pulling of collagen fibrils. In addition, these cells also disintegrated into apoptotic bodies (Fig. 2A, panel f). We examined the ultrastructure of collagen fibrils in collagen gel-coated dishes and collagen gel using SEM. Basically, the diameters of the collagen fibrils and the levels of cross-linking were not different under these two conditions. However, collagen gel coating showed only a few layers of collagen fibrils, whereas collagen gel showed multiple layers of collagen fibrils with greater depth (Fig. 2B). We assessed the growth characteristic as well as apoptosis ratio of LLC-PK1 cells cultured under three conditions. Although collagen gel coating reduced the growth rate of LLC-PK1 cells, collagen gel completely blocked cell growth. Cell viability was significantly higher in cells cultured on collagen gel-coated dishes than on collagen gel (Fig. 2C). More importantly, collagen gel coating significantly (p < 0.001) inhibited collagen gel-induced apoptosis (Fig. 2D). Taking these data together strongly suggested that the low substratum rigidity physical property of collagen gel caused collagen gel-induced apoptosis. Age-augmented Cross-linking of Collagen Fibril Alleviated Collagen Gel-induced Apoptosis—We attributed the cross-linking of collagen fibril to the substratum rigidity of collagen gel. Collagen gels prepared from rat tail tendons of different ages have different mechanical properties due to the cross-links of collagen fibrils (9Jiang S.T. Chiang H.C. Yang T.P. Chuang W.J. Tang M.J.

https://openalex.org/W2002505027,"We herein demonstrate that autocrine human growth hormone production in human mammary carcinoma cells results in increased telomerase activity as a result of specific up-regulation of telomerase catalytic subunit (human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT)) mRNA and protein. This increase in hTERT gene expression is not due to increased transcriptional activation of the hTERT promoter but is the result of increased stability of hTERT mRNA exerted by CU-rich cis-regulatory sequences present in the 3′-untranslated region of TERT mRNA. Autocrine human growth hormone up-regulates two poly(C)-binding proteins, αCP1 and αCP2, which bind to these cis-regulatory elements and stabilize hTERT mRNA. We have therefore demonstrated that post-transcriptional modulation of the level of hTERT mRNA is one mechanism for regulation of cellular telomerase activity.

Chromosomal ends consist of small DNA repeats that are not duplicated faithfully during replication resulting in loss of DNA during each replication. To faithfully replicate chromosomal ends, cells use a reverse transcriptase holoenzyme termed the telomerase complex (1Greider C.W. Blackburn E.H. Cell. 1987; 51: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar). The template human telomerase RNA (hTR) 3The abbreviations used are: hTR, human telomerase RNA; hTERT, human telomerase reverse transcriptase; hGH, human growth hormone; UTR, untranslated region; RT, reverse transcription; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; REMSA, RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assay; UVXL, UV cross-linking; TP, telomerase-associated protein; Hsp, heat shock protein; RPC, RNA-protein binding complex; GST, glutathione S-transferase; siRNA, small interfering RNA; GHRH, growth hormone-releasing hormone. and the reverse transcriptase catalytic subunit (hTERT) are considered to be the major components of the human telomerase complex, because the expression of hTERT and hTR alone is able to restore the majority of telomerase activity (2Nakamura T.M.

Telomerase activity is subject to stringent regulation and is regulated by multiple mechanisms such as hTERT mRNA transcription (3Wu K.J. Grandori C. Amacker M. Simon-Vermot N. Polack A. Lingner J.

Telomerase activity is minimal in most somatic cells resulting in chromosome shortening after each proliferative cycle eventually resulting in crisis and cell death (7de Lange T. Science. 1998; 279: 334-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). However, telomerase activity is readily detected in 90% of all tumor cells (8Kim N.W. Piatyszek M.A. Prowse K.R. Harley C.B.

Specific interactions between sequences within the mRNA (cis-acting regulatory elements) and cellular RNA-binding proteins (trans-acting factors) regulate ribonuclease action and subsequent mRNA decay rates. The majority of these cis-acting elements are present in the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) of the mRNA. cis-Regulatory elements such as AU-rich elements (12Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Trends Biochem.

Liebhaber S.A. RNA. 2002; 8: 265-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Both αCP1 and αCP2 bind to pyrimidinerich elements in the 3′-UTR and stabilize a variety of mRNAs including α-globin and erythropoietin (15Weiss I.M. Liebhaber S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2457-2465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Czyzyk-Krzeska M.F. Bendixen A.C. Blood. 1999; 93: 2111-2120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that autocrine production of hGH in immortalized human mammary epithelial cells concomitantly enhances proliferation and offers protection from apoptosis, forming the basis for abnormal mammary acinar morphogenesis, oncogenic transformation, and tumor formation in vivo (18Zhu T. Starling-Emerald B. Zhang X. Lee K.O. Gluckman P.D. Mertani H.C. Lobie P.E. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 317-324PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, autocrine production of hGH, in mammary carcinoma cells with epithelial morphology, promotes mesenchymal cellular morphology, increased cell migration, and increased metalloprotease activity with subsequent acquisition of invasive behavior both in vitro and in vivo (19Mukhina S. Mertani H.C. Guo K. Lee K.O. Gluckman P.D. Lobie P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 15166-15171Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Given the described oncogenic potential of autocrine hGH and that both the hGH receptor (20Dontu G. Abdallah W.M. Foley J.M. Jackson K.W. Clarke M.F. Kawamura M.J. Wicha M.S. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1253-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (1995) Google Scholar) and telomerase (21Sun W. Kang K.S. Morita I. Trosko J.E. Chang C.C. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6118-6123PubMed Google Scholar) are expressed highly in the human mammary stem cell population compared with differentiated mammary epithelial cells, we have examined the potential regulation of telomerase activity by autocrine hGH. Herein, we demonstrate that autocrine hGH increases telomerase activity. Autocrine hGH increased hTERT mRNA stability by up-regulation of two poly(C)-binding proteins, αCP1 and αCP2, which bind to specific cis-regulatory sequences in the 3′-UTR of hTERT mRNA. Regulation of post-transcriptional stability of hTERT mRNA is therefore one mechanism for cellular modulation of telomerase activity. Cell Lines and Cell Culture—The MCF-7 cell line was obtained from ATCC. The MCF-7 cells were stably transfected either with wild type hGH gene (pMT-hGH) (designated MCF-hGH) or with a translation-deficient hGH (designated MCF-MUT) (55Kaulsay K.K. Zhu T. Bennett W. Lee K.O. Lobie P.E. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 767-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The MCF-7 cells were cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in RPMI supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Serum is a stimulator of hTERT transcription because of the presence of mitogens such as epidermal growth factor, insulin-like growth factor, and estrogens (24Maida Y. Kyo S. Kanaya T. Wang Z.

Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5917-5921PubMed Google Scholar). We have utilized serum deprivation to minimize hTERT transcriptional activation in the experiments reported herein unless indicated otherwise. Plasmids—The full-length and truncated versions of the 3′-UTR of hTERT were generated by PCR amplification from the cDNA generated from MCF-7 cells using the primers: T3.1F, 5′-ATCTCGAGTGGCCACCCGCCCACAG-3′; T3.2F, 5′-ATCTCGAGCTGAGTGAGTGTTTG-3′; T3.3F, 5′-ATCTCGAGTCCTTTGCCTTCCAC-3′; and T3.1R, 5′-TATCTAGACAAAACTGAAAAACTC-3′. Using the XhoI-XbaI sites incorporated into the primers, they were subcloned into pCDNA3.0+ (Invitrogen) to generate pCDNA-hTERT 3′-UTR-full-length; pCDNA-hTERT 3′-UTR-120-554 bp and pCDNA-hTERT 3′-UTR-360-554 bp plasmids. To generate pCDNA-Luc-hTERT 3′-UTR plasmid, luciferase open reading frame was PCR-amplified from pGL2 basic vector (Promega) using primers: LUCF, 5′-TTGGTACCATGGAAGACGCCAAAAAC-3′; and LUCR, 5′-TTCTCGAGTTACAATTTGGACTTTCCG-3′, and was subcloned into the KpnI-XhoI sites of pCDNA-hTERT 3′-UTR plasmids between the cytomegalovirus promoter and hTERT 3′-UTR. The pGL3 containing hTERT promoter (3.328 kb) used for luciferase assay was kindly provided by Dr. Inoue (Ishikawa, Japan). PGEX-αCP1 and PGEX-αCP2 were obtained from Dr. Kiledjian (Piscataway, New Jersey). The full-length coding region of αCP1 and αCP2 were generated by PCR using primers: αCP1F, ACTGAATTCATGCACGGAAAGGAAGTAG; αCP1R, TGTCTCGAGCTAGCTGCACCCCATGC; αCP2F, ACTGAATTCATGGACACCGGTGTGATTG; and αCP2R, TGTCTCGAGCTAGCTGCTCCCCATGc from pGEX-αCP1 and pGEX-αCP2 and were cloned into EcoR1-XhoI sites of pCDNA3.0+ vector. Sequences Used in Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—Extraction of total RNA and the semi-quantitative RT-PCR assay were performed as described previously (38Mertani H.C. Zhu T. Goh E.L. Lee K.O. Morel G. Lobie P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21464-21475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The sequences of the oligonucleotide primers used for semi-quantitative RT-PCR are as follows: hTERTforward, 5′-CGGAAGAGTGTCTGGAGCAA-3′; hTERTreverse, 5′-GGATGAAGCGGAGTCTGGA-3′; TP1forward, 5′-TCAAGCCAAAGGTGAATCTGAG-3′; TP1reverse, 5′-CCCGAGTGAATCTTTCTACGC-3′; hTRforward, 5′-TCTAACCTAACTGAGAAGGGCGTAG-3′; hTRreverse, 5′-GTTTGCTCTAGAATGAACGGTGGAAG-3′); Hsp90αforward, 5′-ATGGAAGAGAGCAAGGCAAA-3′); Hsp90αreverse, 5′-AGAAGATAGCAGGGCGGTTT-3′); Hsp90βforward, 5′-AACTCAGCCTTTGTGGAACG-3′; Hsp90βreverse, 5′-GGGCTTGAGCTTTCATGATT-3′; P23forward, 5′-GGTACGATCGAAGGGACTATG-3′; P23reverse, 5′-AATCCAGGTGATGACAATATTCCTTA-3′; SSBforward, 5′-GTAGGACACATTATTAGAATTGTTG-3′; SSBreverse, 5′-GTACCTCAAGTTGAGCTACATG-3′; RPL22forward, 5′-GCAAGTTCTGAAGTTCACTCTTG-3′; RPL22reverse, 5′-GAGTGGCGAACCAAGGGAAG-3′; STAUforward, 5′-CTACGCAATAGCAGCTGCCTG-3′; STAUreverse, 5′-ACCACATACACATGGATATGATC-3′; DKC1forward, 5′-ATCATGGAGAGAGACACTTACC-3′; DKC1reverse, 5′-TGGTATCACTGTCCCCATCTC-3′; NOLA1forward, 5′-ATAGACCCATATAAGCTGCTGC-3′; NOLA1reverse, 5′-GAGCACCCACAGAGTGCCAG-3′; βActinforward, 5′-ATGATATCGCCGCGCTCG-3′; and βActinreverse, 5′-CGCTCGGTGAGGATCTTCA-3′. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer. 30 μg of total RNA were size-separated on a 1.2% denaturing agarose formaldehyde gel and blotted onto Hybond-N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The RT-PCR product of hTERT, β-actin, and luciferase were gel-purified and used as a template for generating the probes using a high prime DNA labeling kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The blots were hybridized in ExpressHyb buffer (Clontech) at 60-64 °C using denatured hTERT or luciferase probe. The membranes were washed at high stringency (0.1× SSC (0.015 m NaCl and 0.0015 m sodium citrate, pH 7.0) and 0.1% SDS) for 30 min at 65 °C and exposed to x-ray film at -80 °C for 1-7 days. The membranes were stripped in boiling 0.1% SDS and reblotted with the β-actin probe to measure the β-actin mRNA level, which acted as control. mRNA Decay Measurements—To estimate the mRNA decay rates, transcription was inhibited by adding 5 μg/ml actinomycin D in medium (56Eberhardt W. Akool E. Rebhan J. Frank S. Beck K.F. Franzen R. Hamada F.M. Pfeilschifter J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33518-33528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). RNA was extracted at the indicated times, and the endogenous hTERT and β-actin mRNA levels were analyzed by Northern blotting. The x-ray film was quantified by densitometer, and the ratio of hTERT to β-actin in each sample was calculated and used to determine the relative amount of specific mRNA remaining in each sample. Linear relationships were ensured by densitometric analysis of increasing amounts of RNA subject to Northern blot analysis and extending above the maximum densitometric reading used for data collection. Western Blot Analysis and Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy—The following primary antibodies were used. Rabbit anti-hTERT, rabbit anti-p-hnRNP K (Ser302), goat anti-hnRNP K, goat anti-αCP1, and goat anti-αCP2 antibody were from Santa Cruz; rabbit anti-GH antibody was kindly provided by Dr. Parlow (National Institutes of Health NIDDK National Hormone and Peptide Program, Torrance, CA). Nuclear extracts or whole cell extracts were prepared, and Western blots were performed as previously described (38Mertani H.C. Zhu T. Goh E.L. Lee K.O. Morel G. Lobie P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21464-21475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). For immunohistochemistry, the cells were transiently transfected with the indicated plasmids for 12 h and serum-starved for 48 h before fixing them for staining and scanning. Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assay—The cells were cultured to 40-60% confluence in six-well plates. Transient transfection was performed by use of Effectene (Qiagen) as described (38Mertani H.C. Zhu T. Goh E.L. Lee K.O. Morel G. Lobie P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21464-21475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Luciferase assays were performed as described previously (57Graichen R. Liu D. Sun Y. Lee K.O. Lobie P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26662-26672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The results were normalized to the level of β-galactosidase activity and protein concentration in the samples. Telomerase Assay—Telomerase activity was analyzed using TRAPeze telomerase detection kit (Intergen/Chemicon) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, 100 μg of cell extract protein from MCF-MUT or MCF-hGH in the presence or absence of 50 nm hGH was incubated with telomerase substrates, and the telomerase products were amplified by PCR. From 50 μl of PCR product, 40 μl were electrophoresed in a 12% polyacrylamide gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. 5 μl of PCR product was quantified by ELISA according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (REMSA)—Cytoplasmic extracts were prepared as described (54Jiang X.R. Jimenez G. Chang E. Frolkis M. Kusler B. Sage M. Beeche M. Bodnar A.G. Wahl G.M. Tlsty T.D. Chiu C.P. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 111-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). The cells were lysed in cytoplasmic extract buffer (10 mm HEPES, 3 μm MgCl2, 40 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol), containing freshly added protease inhibitors mixture (Roche Applied Science). The lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 4 °C for 20 min at 12,100 × g, and the supernatant was utilized for electrophoretic mobility shift assay and UVXL assay. RNA probes were prepared from linearized vectors (XbaI-digested pCDNA-hTERT 3′-UTR: full length, 120-554 and 360-554 bp for probes 1, 3, and 4, respectively, and StyI-digested pCDNA-hTERT 3′-UTR-full length for probe 2) using T7 transcription kit (Fermentas). Binding reactions were performed with 20 μg of cytoplasmic extract or 800 ng of recombinant protein and 105 cpm of in vitro transcribed 32P-labeled RNA. Binding reactions were incubated at 22 °C for 30 min, after which 2 units of RNase T1 (Roche Applied Science) was added for 10 min, followed by the addition of heparin (final concentration, 5 mg/ml) (Sigma) for 10 min. The complexes were separated by 7% native PAGE, visualized by exposing to x-ray film at -80 °C for 1-3 days. In competition assays, the extracts were incubated with an unlabeled RNA transcripts (∼100-fold excess) or RNA homopolymers (10 ng/μl-100 ng/μl of final concentration) for 5 min prior to the addition of 32P riboprobe. For supershift assay, 1-3-μl antibodies (rabbit anti-αCP1 and rabbit anti-αCP2 used for supershift were a generous gift from Dr. Stephen A. Liebhaber, University of Pennsylvania) were added to the reaction mix after a step of RNase T1 treatment and incubated on ice for 1 h before adding heparin and run on 7% native PAGE. UV Cross-linking Assay—For UVXL assay, following the incubation with heparin, the samples were placed on ice and UV-irradiated for 10 min (58Thomson A.M. Rogers J.T. Walker C.E. Staton J.M. Leedman P.J. BioTechniques. 1999; 27 (and 1042): 1032-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). After UVXL, the samples were incubated with RNaseT1 at 37 °C for 15 min. The samples were boiled for 3 min in SDS sample buffer and electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and exposed to x-ray film. Construction of siRNA to αCP1—We generated two human αCP1 siRNA constructs in pRNAT-CMV3.1/Hygro vector from Genscript targeting the sequences 5′-TCGACAAGCTGGAGGAAGATA-3′ and 5′-CTACTCGATTCAAGGACAACA-3′.5 × 104 MCF-7 cells were seeded into six-well plates and were cultured as above. They were transiently transfected with 1 μg of the scrambled or the siRNA constructs and grown for an additional 18 h. The efficiency of the constructs to knock down αCP1 was tested by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and by immunostaining with αCP1. The construct with the sequence 5′-TCGACAAGCTGGAGGAAGATA-3′ was found to be effective and was used herein. Autocrine hGH Up-regulates Telomerase Activity in a JAK2-dependent Manner—To examine the potential contribution of autocrine hGH to neoplastic progression of the human mammary epithelial cell and to determine the mechanism by which it results in oncogenic transformation, we examined the effect of autocrine hGH on telomerase activity in human mammary carcinoma cells. MCF7 cells were stably transfected with the wild type hGH gene (MCF-hGH) or a translation-deficient hGH gene where the translation initiation is disabled (MCF-MUT) as described previously (22Kaulsay K.K. Mertani H.C. Tornell J. Morel G. Lee K.O. Lobie P.E. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 250: 35-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Telomerase activity was determined using the telomere repeat amplification protocol using the commercial kit from Intergen/Chemicon. In this method, telomerase in the cell extract adds a number of telomeric repeats onto the 3′ end of a biotinylated telomerase substrate oligonucleotide, which is extended and then amplified by PCR. This extension and amplification generates a ladder of products that is observed by agarose gel electrophoresis and ELISA. As observed by both agarose gel electrophoresis and ELISA (Fig. 1, a and b), MCF-hGH cells exhibit increased telomerase activity compared with MCF-MUT cells. The extracts were treated with RNase A to ensure that the PCR product is generated by RNA-dependent telomerase. Exogenously added hGH (50 nm) was without effect on telomerase activity. We also observed autocrine hGH, but not exogenous hGH, regulation of telomerase activity in a nontransformed, but immortalized, human mammary cell line, MCF-10A (data not shown). The cellular effects of hGH are primarily mediated by stimulation of JAK2 activity (23Zhu T. Goh E.L. Graichen R. Ling L. Lobie P.E. Cell Signal. 2001; 13: 599-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The increased telomerase activity observed in MCF-hGH cells as a consequence of autocrine hGH production was completely inhibited by a specific inhibitor of JAK2 (AG490) (Fig. 1c). Thus, autocrine hGH enhancement of human mammary carcinoma cell telomerase activity is JAK2-dependent. Both hTERT mRNA and Protein Levels Are Up-regulated by Autocrine hGH—Telomerase activity is directly correlated to the expression level of hTERT (8Kim N.W. Piatyszek M.A. Prowse K.R. Harley C.B. West M.D. Ho P.L. Coviello G.M. Wright W.E. Weinrich S.L. Shay J.W. Science. 1994; 266: 2011-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (6585) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether autocrine hGH production in mammary carcinoma cells resulted in up-regulation of hTERT mRNA by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and Northern blot analysis (Fig. 2, a and b) and hTERT protein by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2c). Autocrine hGH production in MCF-hGH cells resulted in increased hTERT mRNA and protein compared with MCF-MUT cells (Fig. 2, b and c). To date, regulation of hTERT mRNA has been demonstrated to be predominantly exerted at the transcriptional level (3Wu K.J. Grandori C. Amacker M. Simon-Vermot N. Polack A. Lingner J. Dalla-Favera. R. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 220-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether the autocrine hGH-stimulated increase in hTERT mRNA was due to increased transcriptional activation of the hTERT promoter by use of a reporter construct containing 3.328 kb of the promoter 5′ to the hTERT start site (24Maida Y. Kyo S. Kanaya T. Wang Z. Yatabe N. Tanaka M. Nakamura M. Ohmichi M. Gotoh N. Murakami S. Inoue M. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 4071-4079Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, autocrine hGH did not increase reporter activity from the hTERT promoter (Fig. 2d). In contrast both serum (10%) (Fig. 2e) and 17β-estradiol (10 nm) stimulation (data not shown) of MCF-7 cells resulted in activation of the hTERT promoter. The autocrine hGH-stimulated increase in hTERT mRNA was therefore not due to transcriptional regulation of the hTERT gene. hGH Specifically Up-regulates hTERT mRNA—Human telomerase is a complex structure comprised of a core enzyme and a number of telomerase-associated proteins. Based on reconstitution experiments in Saccharomyces cerevisiae two essential subunits required for telomerase function are hTR, which serves as the template for telomeric DNA synthesis and the hTERT (25Bachand F. Autexier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38027-38031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, fully functional telomerase complex comprises other components such as telomerase-associated protein 1 (TP1), Hsp90, p23, DKC1, STAU, RPL22, NOLA1, and SSB (26Keith W.N. Bilsland A. Evans T.R. Glasspool R.M. Expert Rev. Mol. Med. 2002; : 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Such additional components interact with telomerase and assist in proper ribonucleoprotein assembly and formation of an active telomerase enzyme complex (27Cong Y.S. Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 407-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the possibility that autocrine hGH may regulate other components of the telomerase enzyme complex in addition to hTERT. The mRNA level of the different telomerase subunits from MCF-MUT and MCF-hGH cells were examined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Of the 11 subunits and associated proteins examined, only hTERT mRNA exhibited significant up-regulation in response to autocrine hGH (Fig. 2a). hTR, TP1, Hsp90, DKC1, NOLA1, STAU, and P21 exhibited no difference between the two cell lines, whereas RPL22 and SSB were down-regulated by autocrine production of hGH. Autocrine hGH Stabilizes hTERT mRNA—The lack of transcriptional regulation of hTERT by autocrine hGH is indicative that the autocrine hGH-stimulated increase in hTERT mRNA will be achieved by post-transcriptional regulation such as stabilization of hTERT mRNA. To examine this possibility we first utilized serum deprivation to minimize hTERT transcriptional activation. Serum is a stimulator of hTERT transcription because of the presence of mitogens such as epidermal growth factor, insulin-like growth factor, and estrogens (24Maida Y. Kyo S. Kanaya T. Wang Z. Yatabe N. Tanaka M. Nakamura M. Ohmichi M. Gotoh N. Murakami S. Inoue M. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 4071-4079Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 28Klapper W. Singh K.K. Heidorn K. Parwaresch R. Krupp G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1442: 120-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 29Kyo S. Takakura M. Kanaya T. Zhuo W. Fujimoto K. Nishio Y. Orimo A. Inoue M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5917-5921PubMed Google Scholar). We quantified hTERT mRNA levels by Northern blot analysis in both MCF-MUT and MCF-hGH cells in different time points after serum deprivation. The level of hTERT mRNA in MCF-MUT cells decreased more than 2-fold after 6 h of serum deprivation. In comparison, the level of hTERT mRNA in MCF-hGH cells exhibited only a slight decrease, even after 12 h of serum deprivation (Fig. 3a). To verify this potential stabilization of hTERT mRNA by autocrine hGH, we inhibited mRNA transcription by use of actinomycin D and determined the half-life of hTERT mRNA in MCF-MUT and MCF-hGH cells. As presented in (Fig. 3b), the calculated half-life of hTERT mRNA in MCF-hGH cells was 10 h compared with a 6-h half-life for hTERT mRNA in MCF-MUT cells. Thus, autocrine hGH stabilizes hTERT mRNA and results in an increase in hTERT mRNA expression. Autocrine hGH-stimulated hTERT mRNA Stability Is Due to cis-Acting Sequences in the 3′-UTR Region—3′-UTRs are most frequently linked with regulation of mRNA stability (30Grzybowska E.A. Wilczynska A. Siedlecki J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Given that autocrine hGH promoted stabilization of hTERT mRNA, we next localized potential 3′-UTR cis-acting sequences responsible for autocrine hGH-dependent hTERT mRNA stabilization. To this end, we generated a series of reporter plasmids in which the full-length (1-554 bp) and truncated (120-554 and 360-554 bp) versions of the 3′-UTR of hTERT mRNA were fused to the 3′ end of the luciferase open reading frame and cloned into the pCDNA3+ expression vector (Fig. 4a). MCF-MUT and MCF-hGH cells were transiently transfected with the indicated constructs, and the half-life of luciferase mRNA was estimated by Northern blot analysis after actinomycin D chase experiments. Luciferase mRNA lacking the surrogate 3′-UTR of hTERT exhibited a similar half-life of ∼6h in both MCF-MUT and MCF-hGH cells (Fig. 4b). In contrast, luciferase mRNA combined with the full-length hTERT 3′-UTR degraded with a half-life of approximately5hin MCF-MUT cells in contrast to MCF-hGH cells, where the half-life was prolonged for >10 h (Fig. 4c). The last 434 bp (nucleotide positions 120-554) of hTERT 3′-UTR also conferred stability to the luciferase transcript in MCF-hGH cells (half-life >10 h) as compared with that of MCF-MUT cells (half-life ∼5 h) (Fig. 4d), similar to that observed with the full-length 3′-UTR. In contrast, the last 194 bp (position 360-554) of hTERT 3′-UTR failed to provide the differential stability to luciferase mRNA between MCF-MUT and MCF-hGH cells with a half-life of 5 h in both cell lines (Fig. 4e). To further verify the differential stability of luciferase mRNA with the surrogate 3′-UTR of hTERT observed between MCF-MUT and MCF-hGH cells, we measured the luciferase activity of the various constructs in both cell lines under serum deprivation. Both MCF-MUT and MCF-hGH cells were transfected with the indicated constructs for 6 h followed by serum deprivation for 48 h ± 20 μm AG490, and the luciferase activity was determined. Consistent with that observed by Northern blot analysis after actinomycin D chase, luciferase activity was higher by ∼2-fold in MCF-hGH cells compared with MCF-MUT cells when transfected with the luciferase vectors containing either the full-length or the 120-554-bp fragment of hTERT 3′-UTR. Concordantly, there was no difference in luciferase activity between MCF-hGH and MCF-MUT cells when transfected with the control luciferase vector or the luciferase vector containing the 360-554-bp fragment of hTERT 3′-UTR. Further, the JAK2 inhibitor AG490 prevented the hTERT 3′-UTR mediated up-regulation of luciferase activity observed in MCF-h"
https://openalex.org/W2009869791,"A dodecasaccharide motif of the low-sulfated chondroitin 4-sulfate (C4S) mediate the binding of Plasmodium falciparum-infected red blood cells (IRBCs) in human placenta. Here we studied the detailed C4S structural requirements by assessing the ability of chemically modified C4S to inhibit IRBC binding to the placental chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan. Replacement of the N-acetyl groups with bulky N-acyl or N-benzoyl substituents had no effect on the inhibitory activity of C4S, whereas reduction of the carboxyl groups abrogated the activity. Dermatan sulfates showed ∼50% inhibitory activity when compared with C4Ss with similar sulfate contents. These data demonstrate that the C4S carboxyl groups and their equatorial orientation but not the N-acetyl groups are critical for IRBC binding. Conjugation of bulky substituents to the reducing end N-acetylgalactosamine residues of C4S dodecasaccharide had no effect on its inhibitory activity. Based on these results, we prepared photoaffinity reagents for the identification of the parasite proteins involved in C4S binding. Cross-linking of the IRBCs with a radioiodinated photoactivable C4S dodecasaccharide labeled a ∼22-kDa novel parasite protein, suggesting strongly for the first time that a low molecular weight IRBC surface protein rather than a 200–400-kDa PfEMP1 is involved in C4S binding. Conjugation of biotin to the C4S dodecasaccharide photoaffinity probe afforded a strategy for the isolation of the labeled protein by avidin affinity precipitation, facilitating efforts to identify the C4S-adherent IRBC protein(s). Our results also have broader implications for designing oligosaccharide-based photoaffinity probes for the identification of proteins involved in glycosaminoglycan-dependent attachment of microbes to hosts.

Dermatan sulfates showed ∼50% inhibitory activity when compared with C4Ss with similar sulfate contents. These data demonstrate that the C4S carboxyl groups and their equatorial orientation but not the N-acetyl groups are critical for IRBC binding. Conjugation of bulky substituents to the reducing end N-acetylgalactosamine residues of C4S dodecasaccharide had no effect on its inhibitory activity. Based on these results, we prepared photoaffinity reagents for the identification of the parasite proteins involved in C4S binding. Cross-linking of the IRBCs with a radioiodinated photoactivable C4S dodecasaccharide labeled a ∼22-kDa novel parasite protein, suggesting strongly for the first time that a low molecular weight IRBC surface protein rather than a 200–400-kDa PfEMP1 is involved in C4S binding. Conjugation of biotin to the C4S dodecasaccharide photoaffinity probe afforded a strategy for the isolation of the labeled protein by avidin affinity precipitation, facilitating efforts to identify the C4S-adherent IRBC protein(s). Our results also have broader implications for designing oligosaccharide-based photoaffinity probes for the identification of proteins involved in glycosaminoglycan-dependent attachment of microbes to hosts. An unusual feature of Plasmodium falciparum infection compared with the three other human malarial parasites, Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium ovale, and Plasmodium malariae, is that only the former parasite is able to sequester in the microvascular capillaries of various organs (1Pasloske B.L.

In response to the development of adherent phenotype-specific immunity by hosts, parasites with different adherent receptor specificity evolve to efficiently survive in the host. However, eventually, when immunity to various adhesive parasite phenotypes is developed, the host effectively controls infection and avoids pathogenesis. This is generally true for malaria-immune people regardless of gender. However, in the case of pregnant women, placenta presents a new receptor for IRBC adherence allowing selection and propagation of parasites with different adherent specificities to which the host was not previously exposed. Accumulation of red blood cells infected with these phenotypically distinct parasites and subsequent monocyte/macrophage infiltration in the placenta lead to pregnancy-associated malaria characterized by poor pregnancy outcomes and maternal fatalities (7McGregor I.A.

Science. 1996; 272: 1502-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar) in 1996 that placental adherent IRBCs bind specifically to C4S but not to other glycosaminoglycans was confirmed by us and others (11Rogerson S.J.

Particularly we showed that an unusually low sulfated CSPG localized predominantly in the intervillous space is the natural receptor for the placental IRBC adherence (14Muthusamy A. Achur R.N.

Further we and others demonstrated that optimal IRBC binding requires the participation of both 4-sulfated and 4-nonsulfated disaccharide moieties (15Alkhalil A. Achur R.N. Valiyaveettil M.

We have also shown that a dodecasaccharide motif of the C4S with at least two 4-sulfated disaccharides is the minimum requirement for the efficient IRBC binding (15Alkhalil A. Achur R.N.

Whereas C4S has been conclusively shown to be the receptor for placental IRBC adherence, the identity of the parasite adhesive ligand expressed on the surface of the IRBCs remains unclear (19Rowe J.A. Kyes S.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 1011-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). It is widely thought that a subset of PfEMP1s containing domains analogous to the erythrocyte Duffy-binding ligands of P. vivax, which are known to be expressed on the IRBC surface, mediate the IRBC adherence to various host receptors, including CD36, intercellular adhesion molecule 1, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, and C4S (20Baruch D.I.

It appears that the primary function of PfEMP1 is to prevent IRBCs from being readily recognized by the host immune system (23Recker M. Nee S. Bull P.C. Kinyanjui S. Marsh K. Newbold C. Gupta S. Nature. 2004; 429: 555-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 24Bull P.C. Pain A. Ndungu F.M. Kinyanjui S.M. Roberts D.J. Newbold C.I. Marsh K. J. Infect. Dis. 2005; 192: 1119-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In 1999, two groups reported that two distinct PfEMP1 variants, one termed FCR3var1CSA (from FCR-3 parasite strain) and the other termed CS2var1CSA (from CS2 parasite strain), mediate IRBC binding to C4S in a strain-dependent manner (25Buffet P.A. Gamain B. Scheidig C. Baruch D. Smith J.D. Hernandez-Rivas R. Pouvelle B. Oishi S. Fujii N. Fusai T. Parzy D. Miller L.H. Gysin J. Scherf A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1999; 96: 5198-5202Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In both cases, a specific domain called DBL-3γ was reported to be involved in the IRBC binding. However, it remains to be authenticated whether PfEMP1 is the ligand for placental IRBC adherence because although some subsequent studies support the above observations others do not (19Rowe J.A. Kyes S.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 1011-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Recently a well conserved var gene subfamily PfEMP1 named var2CSA has been proposed to be the parasite ligand involved in C4S binding (27Salanti A. Staalsoe T. Lavstsen T. Jensen A.T. Sowa M.P. Arnot D.E. Hviid L. Theander T.G. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 179-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 28Salanti A. Dahlback M. Turner L. Nielsen M.A. Barfod L. Magistrado P. Jensen A.T.

The var2CSA gene has been shown to transcribe at high levels in several C4S-binding parasite strains, and antibodies raised against a recombinant var2CSA can bind to IRBC surface in a gender-specific and parity-dependent manner (27Salanti A.

However, the ability of the recombinant var2CSA or anti-var2CSA antibodies to inhibit IRBC binding to C4S has not been demonstrated. Finally direct biochemical evidence in support of either DBL-3γ domain of var1or var2 PfEMP1 binding to C4S is lacking, and the possible involvement of other proteins cannot be ruled out. A major reason hindering the efforts to definitely identify the P. falciparum C4S-adhesive protein(s) is that the very low affinity of C4S-IRBC interaction precludes affinity purification. One approach to circumvent the problem will be to photoaffinity label the protein prior to affinity purification. A prerequisite for this approach is the elucidation of the role of functional groups in the C4S motif involved in binding to IRBC. Accordingly in this study, we investigated the potential of chemically modified C4S to inhibit the binding of IRBC to the placental CSPG. Based on the results, we prepared 125I-labeled photoactivable derivatives of C4S dodecasaccharide by partially replacing the acetyl groups of GalNAc by 4-azidosalicylyl groups. The C4S-IRBC adhesion-inhibitory activities of these derivatives were almost comparable to that of the unmodified oligosaccharide. Cross-linking of the photoaffinity probes to the C4S-adherent IRBC surface specifically labeled a ∼22-kDa parasite protein. In another approach, photoaffinity cross-linking of a probe containing a biotin residue at the C-1 of the reducing end of C4S dodecasaccharide to IRBC surface proteins enabled the isolation of the proteins by avidin affinity precipitation. Thus, our approaches offer, for the first time, strategies for the purification and biochemical characterization of the parasite adhesive protein(s). Moreover these procedures have important implications for designing photoactivable probes for the identification of adhesive protein(s) involved in the glycosaminoglycan-dependent adherence of various pathogens to host cells.

IRBC Adhesion Inhibition Assay—Adhesion/inhibition assays were carried out according to Alkhalil et al. (15Alkhalil A. Achur R.N. Valiyaveettil M. Ockenhouse C.F. Gowda D.C. J. Biol.

Briefly a solution of the placental CSPG (200 ng/ml) in PBS, pH 7.2, was coated onto polystyrene Petri dishes (Falcon 1058) as circular spots (∼4-mm diameter) for 4 h at room temperature and blocked with 1% BSA in PBS for 1 h. Suspensions (2%) of parasite culture (20–35% parasitemia) cell pellet in PBS, pH 7.2, were preincubated with C4S or the test C4S derivatives at room temperature for 30 min with occasional shaking and then overlaid onto the CSPG-coated spots. After 30 min at room temperature, the unbound cells were removed by washing with PBS, pH 7.2. The bound cells were fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde, stained with 1% Giemsa, and counted under a light microscope at 40× magnifications in five to six different fields. The number of cells in one-fourth (one grid) of these fields was counted. The average number of cells per grid was typically 65–110. These values were used to calculate the number of cells (4000–7000) bound per 1 mm2 of CSPG-coated plates. In inhibition studies, the number of cells bound per 1 mm2 in the presence of the inhibitor was calculated as a percentage of that bound in the absence of inhibitors. All assays were performed in duplicates and repeated two to three times. Regioselective 6-O-Desulfation of bCSA—A partially 4-sulfated C4S that efficiently inhibits IRBC binding to the placental CSPG was prepared as reported previously (15Alkhalil A. Achur R.N.

The lyophilized material was dissolved in anhydrous pyridine (100 ml), and N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)acetamide (20 ml) was added and heated at 80 °C for 4 h under anhydrous condition. After cooling in an ice bath and dilution to 250 ml with ice-cold water to decompose excess sialylating reagent, the reaction mixture was dialyzed against water and lyophilized. The 6-O-desulfated chondroitin sulfate was applied onto a DEAE-Sepharose column (1.5 × 10 cm) in 50 mm NaOAc, pH 5.5, containing 100 mm NaCl, washed with the above buffer containing 0.2 m NaCl, and eluted with a gradient of 0.2–1 m NaCl. Fractions (3 ml) were collected, and aliquots were assayed for uronic acid (13Achur R.N. Valiyaveettil M. Alkhalil A. Ockenhouse C.F. Gowda D.C. J. Biol.

A pooled fraction consisting of 40% 4-sulfated, 59% nonsulfated, and 1% 6-sulfated disaccharides was used in this study. Solvolytic Desulfation of Fully Sulfated C4S and DS—The sodium salts of sturgeon notochord C4S or dermatan sulfate (20 mg each) were converted to the pyridinium salt as above (15Alkhalil A.

The pyridinium salts were dissolved separately in 10% aqueous Me2SO (10 ml), and each was divided into four equal parts and placed in screw-capped glass vials. The vials were heated at 80 °C, and one each was removed at 15, 40, 50, and 60 min and cooled in an ice bath. The content of each vial was diluted to 5.0 ml with water, adjusted to pH 9.0 with 0.1 m NaOH, dialyzed against water, and lyophilized. The sulfate contents of the partially desulfated C4S and DS ranged from 28 to 78% (see Table 2).TABLE 2Disaccharide composition of partially sulfated C4S and DS used for evaluating IRBC adhesion-inhibitory activity shown in Fig. 5GAGsDisaccharidesaDetermined by HPLC analysis of disaccharide released by digestion with chondroitinase ABC (38).ΔDi-0SΔDi-4SΔDi-6S% mol proportionC4S-121781.0C4S-248520C4S-362380C4S-470300DS-125750DS-245550DS-358420DS-472280a Determined by HPLC analysis of disaccharide released by digestion with chondroitinase ABC (38Sugahara K.

N-Deacetylation of C4S—The C4S was N-deacetylated by hydrazinolysis according to Shaklee and Conrad (33Shaklee P.N. Conrad H.E. Biochem. J. 1984; 217: 187-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). C4S (70 mg) was dissolved in anhydrous hydrazine (1.2 ml) containing 1% hydrazine sulfate in a reaction ampoule and flushed with nitrogen. The ampoule was sealed and heated in an oil bath at 105 °C. After 5 h, the reaction mixture was cooled and freeze-dried, and the residue was washed three times with 0.5 ml of toluene. The solid residue was dissolved in 0.25 m iodic acid (1 ml) and extracted with chloroform to remove the released iodine. The aqueous solution was neutralized to pH 7.4 with 0.1 m NaOH, dialyzed, and lyophilized. N-Acylation—N-Deacetylated C4S (2 mg) in 500 μl of PBS was dialyzed against saturated aqueous NaHCO3. To this solution, 3 × 50-μl aliquots of 10% solutions of anhydrides (acetic, propionic, butyric, hexanoic, or benzoic) in acetone were added at 20-min intervals (34Finne J. Krusius T. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 83: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The reaction mixtures were allowed to stand at room temperature for 1 h, dialyzed against water, and lyophilized. The extent of N-acylation or N-benzoylation was determined by nitrous acid treatment followed by analysis of the products on Bio-Gel P-10 columns (35Cifonelli J.A. Methods Carbohydr. Chem. 1976; 8: 139-141Google Scholar). With hexanoic and benzoic anhydrides, the N-acylation procedure was repeated three times to achieve near complete acylation of free -NH2 groups, and any remaining -NH2 groups were acetylated with acetic anhydride. Reduction of Carboxyl Groups—To a solution of C4S (100 mg) in 15 ml of water solid EDAC (380 mg) was added, and the pH was maintained at 4.75 with 0.1 m HCl. After 2 h at room temperature, solid sodium borohydride (0.5–150 mg) was added over a period of 1 h, and the pH of the reaction mixture was maintained at 7.0 with the addition of 1 m HCl (36Taylor R.L. Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Methods Carbohydr. Chem. 1976; 8: 149-151Google Scholar). The solution was then acidified to pH 5 with 0.1 m HCl to decompose the excess of borohydride. The carboxyl-reduced C4Ss were treated with 50 mm NaOH at 37 °C for 10–12 h to hydrolyze any EDAC ester of unreduced carboxylic acid groups, neutralized with 2 m acetic acid, dialyzed, and lyophilized. 2-O-Desulfation—Chondroitin sulfate D (5 mg) was dissolved in 10 ml of 0.05 m sodium hydroxide, and pH of the solution was adjusted to 12.5 by the addition of 1 m sodium hydroxide to a final concentration of 0.2 m (37Jaseja M. Rej R.N. Sauriol F. Perlin A.S. Can. J. Chem. 1989; 67: 1449-1456Crossref Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The solution was lyophilized, dissolved in 10 ml of water, dialyzed, and lyophilized. Digestion of C4S and Its N-Acylated Derivatives with Chondroitinase ABC—The C4S and its derivatives (100 μg each) were digested with chondroitinase ABC (50 milliunits) in 50 μl of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 30 mm NaOAc and 0.01% BSA at 37 °C for 5 h as described previously (13Achur R.N.

The samples were analyzed by gel filtration on Bio-Gel P-10 columns (1.5 × 70 cm). Analysis of N-Deacetylated C4S and Re-N-acylated C4S by Nitrous Acid Degradation—The N-deacetylated, re-N-acylated, or re-N-benzoylated C4Ss (100 μg) were dissolved in 100 μl of 200 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 3.8 (35Cifonelli J.A. Methods Carbohydr. Chem. 1976; 8: 139-141Google Scholar). An equal volume of 1 m sodium nitrite was added, and the reaction mixture was allowed to stand at room temperature for 24 h and then chromatographed on Bio-Gel P-10 columns. Gel Permeation Chromatography—The analysis of modified C4S and its nitrous acid or chondroitinase ABC degradation products was performed on columns of Sepharose CL-6B (1 × 50 cm), Bio Gel P-6 (1.5 × 70 cm), or Bio-Gel P-10 (1.5 × 70 cm) using either 0.2 m sodium chloride or 0.1 m pyridine, 0.1 m acetic acid, pH 5.5. Fractions (0.67 or 2 ml) were collected and assayed for the uronic acid content. Disaccharide Compositional Analysis—The C4S (5–10 μg) in 50 μl of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 30 mm NaOAc and 0.01% BSA was digested with chondroitinase ABC (2.5–5 milliunits) at 37 °C for 6 h (13Achur R.N.

We developed a fusion protein consisting of the ligand binding domains of the IL-6 receptor subunits IL-6Rα and gp130 that acts as a highly potent IL-6 inhibitor. Gp130 is a shared cytokine receptor also used by the IL-6-related cytokines oncostatin M and leukemia inhibitory factor. In this study, we have shown that the IL-6 receptor fusion protein (IL-6-RFP) is a specific IL-6 inhibitor that does not block oncostatin M or leukemia inhibitory factor. We characterized the complex of IL-6-RFP and fluorescently labeled IL-6 (YFPIL-6) by blue native PAGE and gel filtration. A 2-fold molar excess of IL-6-RFP over IL-6 was sufficient to entirely bind IL-6 in a complex with IL-6-RFP. As shown by treatment with urea and binding competition experiments, the complex of IL-6 and IL-6-RFP is more stable than the complex of IL-6, soluble IL-6Rα, and soluble gp130. By live cell imaging, we have demonstrated that YFP-IL-6 bound to the surface of cells expressing gp130-CFP is removed from the plasma membrane upon the addition of IL-6-RFP. The apparent molecular mass of the IL-6·IL-6-RFP complex determined by blue native PAGE and gel filtration suggests that IL-6 is trapped in a structure analogous to the native hexameric IL-6 receptor complex. Thus, fusion of the ligand binding domains of heteromeric receptors leads to highly specific cytokine inhibitors with superior activity compared with the separate soluble receptors.

Thus, fusion of the ligand binding domains of heteromeric receptors leads to highly specific cytokine inhibitors with superior activity compared with the separate soluble receptors. Cytokines are important mediators in the regulation of immune responses and inflammation. Dysregulated cytokine signaling leads to chronic inflammation and cancer. Therefore, pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) 2The abbreviations used are: TNF, tumor necrosis factor; BSA, bovine serum albumin; CBM, cytokine binding module; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; IL, interleukin; LIF, leukemia inhibitory factor; OSM, oncostatin M; RFP, receptor fusion protein; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; s, soluble; D, domain; R, receptor; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; Bistris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl) amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol. and interleukin-1 and -6, have been identified as promising therapeutic targets. First approaches to specifically block the action of pro-inflammatory cytokines have focused on the use of neutralizing antibodies against a specific cytokine or its receptor. Only recently, the value of soluble cytokine receptors as cytokine antagonists for the treatment of inflammatory diseases has been fully recognized. Pro-inflammatory cytokines signal through receptor proteins consisting of an extracellular part, a single transmembrane region and a cytoplasmic domain. Ligand binding to the extracellular part of the receptor results in the activation of signal transduction cascades by the cytoplasmic domain. Soluble receptors consisting only of the extracellular part are potent inhibitors of cytokine activity. They bind the cytokine with the same specificity and affinity as the membrane-bound receptors without eliciting an intracellular signal. A dimeric form of the soluble TNF receptor is currently used for the treatment of inflammatory diseases caused by elevated TNF expression (1Goldenberg M.M. Clin. Ther. 1999; 21: 75-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Most cytokines signal through heteromeric receptor complexes consisting of two or more different receptor subunits. In such a case, inhibition of cytokine activity by soluble receptors is more challenging. Recently, we and others have shown that the appropriate fusion of different soluble receptor proteins results in highly potent antagonists (2Economides A.N. Carpenter L.R. Rudge J.S. Wong V. Koehler-Stec E.M. Hartnett C. Pyles E.A. Xu X. Daly T.J. Young M.R. Fandl J.P. Lee F. Carver S. McNay J. Bailey K. Ramakanth S. Hutabarat R. Huang T.T. Radziejewski C. Yancopoulos G.D. Stahl N. Nat.

Interleukin-6 (IL-6) has been validated as a target for the treatment of several diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and the lymphoproliferative disorder known as Castleman disease (4Choy E. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 2003; 62: 68-69PubMed Google Scholar, 5Nishimoto N. Kanakura Y. Aozasa K. Johkoh T. Nakamura M. Nakano S. Nakano N. Ikeda Y. Sasaki T. Nishioka K. Hara M. Taguchi H. Kimura Y. Kato Y. Asaoku H. Kumagai S. Kodama F. Nakahara H. Hagihara K. Yoshizaki K. Kishimoto T. Blood. 2005; 106: 2627-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). IL-6 signals through two different receptor proteins. It first binds to an α-receptor subunit (IL-6Rα). The low affinity complex of IL-6 and IL-6Rα engages the signal transducing receptor subunit gp130 leading to a high affinity receptor complex and the initiation of the cytoplasmic signaling cascades. Upon ligand binding, Janus tyrosine kinases that are constitutively associated with gp130 become activated, resulting in tyrosine phosphorylation of the transcription factor STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3). Activated STAT3 accumulates in the nucleus where it induces IL-6 target genes (6Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Haan S. Hermanns H.M. Müller-Newen G. Schaper F. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (2544) Google Scholar). Soluble gp130 (sgp130) has a moderate antagonistic effect on IL-6 activity (7Narazaki M. Yasukawa K. Saito T. Ohsugi Y. Fukui H. Koishihara Y. Yancopoulos G.D. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Blood. 1993; 82: 1120-1126Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas soluble IL-6Rα (sIL-6Rα) acts even agonistically (8Taga T. Hibi M. Hirata Y. Yamasaki K. Yasukawa K. Matsuda T. Hirano T. Kishimoto T. Cell. 1989; 58: 573-581Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1205) Google Scholar). Together with IL-6, sIL-6Rα can be regarded as a co-ligand required for the activation of gp130. We have shown that, in the presence of sgp130, the agonistic activity of sIL-6Rα is converted to an antagonistic activity (9Müller-Newen G. Küster A. Hemmann U. Keul R. Horsten U. Martens A. Graeve L. Wijdenes J. Heinrich P.C. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6347-6355PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the combined application of sIL-6Rα and sgp130 results in a strong inhibition of IL-6 activity. The extracellular part of gp130 consists of a single Ig-like domain (D1) followed by five fibronectin type III-like domains (D2–D6) (10Hibi M. Murakami M. Saito M. Hirano T. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Cell. 1990; 63: 1149-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar). Domains D2 and D3 form the cytokine binding module (CBM), which is the structural hallmark of the hematopoietic cytokine receptors (11Wells J.A. de Vos A.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 609-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The extracellular part of IL-6Rα also consists of an Ig-like domain (D1) followed by a CBM (D2 and D3) (12Yamasaki K. Taga T. Hirata Y. Yawata H. Kawanishi Y. Seed B. Taniguchi T. Hirano T. Kishimoto T. Science. 1988; 241: 825-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). By mutational analysis, it was shown that IL-6 contacts its receptors with three distinct binding sites (13Simpson R.J. Hammacher A. Smith D.K. Matthews J.M. Ward L.D. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 929-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Site I binds the CBM of IL-6Rα (14Yawata H. Yasukawa K. Natsuka S. Murakami M. Yamasaki K. Hibi M. Taga T. Kishimoto T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1705-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), and sites II and III interact with the CBM and D1 of gp130, respectively (15Kurth I. Horsten U. Pflanz S. Dahmen H. Küster A. Grötzinger J. Heinrich P.C. Müller-Newen G. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 1480-1487PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the structure of the soluble hexameric IL-6 receptor complex consisting of two molecules of each IL-6, sIL-6Rα (D2–D3), and sgp130 (D1–D3) has been solved by x-ray crystallography (16Boulanger M.J. Chow D. Brevnova E.E. Garcia K.C. Science. 2003; 300: 2101-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). One IL-6 molecule contacts with its site II the CBM of one gp130, and with its site III, the Ig-like domain of a second gp130 molecule. The same is valid for the second IL-6 molecule leading to a highly symmetric complex. Based on the structural features of the IL-6 receptor complex and the well characterized antagonistic activity of the combination of sIL-6Rα and sgp130, we designed a fusion protein (inter-leukin-6 receptor fusion protein, IL-6-RFP) consisting of the ligand binding domains of gp130 (D1–D3) and IL-6Rα (D2–D3) fused with an appropriate peptide linker (see Fig. 7A) (3Ancey C. Küster A. Haan S. Herrmann A. Heinrich P.C. Müller-Newen G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16968-16972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We have shown that this fusion protein acts as a highly potent IL-6 inhibitor. The cytokine receptor gp130 is a shared receptor subunit that is used by other IL-6-type cytokines, such as inter-leukin-11 (IL-11), oncostatin M (OSM), and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) (17Bravo J. Heath J.K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2399-2411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Müller-Newen G. Science's STKE. 2003; 2003: pe40Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although IL-6-RFP does not inhibit IL-11 (3Ancey C. Küster A. Haan S. Herrmann A. Heinrich P.C. Müller-Newen G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16968-16972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), its activity toward LIF and OSM has not been tested yet. Although the importance of fused cytokine receptors as future drugs has been recognized (19Dinarello C.A. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 20-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), their mode of action has not been analyzed in sufficient detail. Therefore, we investigated the specificity, stability, and stoichiometry of the complex formed by IL-6 and IL-6-RFP. We have shown that IL-6-RFP is a highly specific IL-6 inhibitor that does not interfere with the bioactivity of the related cytokines LIF and OSM. A new method for the analysis of protein-protein interactions based on blue native gel electrophoresis, fluorescent fusion proteins, and fluorescence scanning is presented. We have shown that a 2-fold molar excess of IL-6-RFP over IL-6 is sufficient to completely trap IL-6 in a binary IL-6·IL-6-RFP complex. The complex of IL-6·IL-6-RFP is more stable than the complex of IL-6 with the separate soluble receptors sIL-6Rα and sgp130. As shown in a live cell imaging experiment, YFP-IL-6, once bound to its cell surface receptors, is removed from the plasma membrane upon the addition of IL-6-RFP. Analysis of the stoichiometry by native gel electrophoresis and gel filtration suggests that the architecture of the IL-6·IL-6-RFP complex is analogous to the hexameric receptor complex identified by x-ray crystal-lography. Thus, IL-6-RFP is a promising IL-6 inhibitor for the treatment of diseases caused by dysregulated IL-6 expression. Cytokines, Cytokine Receptors—Recombinant human IL-6 was expressed in Escherichia coli, refolded, and purified as described previously (20Arcone R. Pucci P. Zappacosta F. Fontaine V. Malorni A. Marino G. Ciliberto G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 198: 541-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The specific activity of IL-6 was measured by a B9 cell proliferation assay (21Aarden L.A. De Groot E.R. Schaap O.L. Lansdorp P.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1987; 17: 1411-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar). OSM was purchased from PeproTech (Rocky Hill, NJ) and LIF from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). sIL-6Rα was expressed in insect cells as previously described (22Weiergräber O. Hemmann U. Küster A. Müller-Newen G. Schneider J. Rose-John S. Kurschat P. Brakenhoff J.P. Hart M.H. Stabel S. Heinrich P.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 661-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). sgp130 was obtained from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Cell Culture and Transfection of HepG2 Cells—The human hepatoma cell line HepG2 (purchased from the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium F-12 1:1 mix with GlutaMax™I (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Cytogen, Princeton, NJ). For starvation conditions, cells were cultured in pure, serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 4500 mg/liter glucose, Glutamax™I, and pyruvate (Invitrogen). Plasmids were transiently transfected into HepG2 cells using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell Culture and Transfection of COS-7 Cells—The simian monkey kidney cell line COS-7 (kindly provided by I. M. Kerr, Cancer Research UK, London, UK) was cultivated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with GlutaMax™ (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 mg/liter streptomycin, and 100,000 units/liter penicillin (Cambrex BioScience, Verviers, Belgium). Cells were grown at 37 °C in a water-saturated atmosphere in 5% CO2. Plasmids were transiently transfected into COS-7 cells using Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Reporter Gene Assay—HepG2 cells were seeded onto 6-well plates (9.6 cm2/well) and transiently co-transfected with pGL3-α2M-Luc (construct with luciferase gene regulated by the α2 macroglobulin promoter) and pCR™3 LacZ (galactosidase construct with a constitutively active promoter; Amersham Biosciences). Cells were starved in serum-free medium for 6 h and subsequently stimulated with 5 ng/ml IL-6 or the combination of IL-6 and IL-6-RFP for 16 h at the molar ratios indicated. To determine the specificity of IL-6-RFP, HepG2 cells were stimulated in parallel with 0.5 ng/ml OSM or a mixture of OSM and IL-6-RFP, with 5 ng/ml LIF, or a mixture of LIF and IL-6-RFP. Previous to stimulation, the corresponding cytokine and IL-6-RFP were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C to allow complex formation. Preparation of cellular lysates and luciferase measurements were carried out according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Promega). The luciferase activity values were normalized to the transfection efficiency, which was determined as β-galactosidase activity. The experiments were carried out in triplicates, and the mean values and standard deviations were calculated. Preparation of Cell Lysates, SDS-PAGE, Western Blotting, and Immunodetection—HepG2 cells were cultured on 6-well plates, starved overnight, and stimulated with the indicated cytokine or combination of cytokine and IL-6-RFP for 20 min. Subsequently, cells were lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm NaF, 15% glycerol, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin). The lysates were analyzed with SDS-PAGE, Western blotting, and immunodetection using an antibody directed against phosphotyrosine (705)-STAT3 (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) or STAT3 (type H190, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Both antibodies were used in a 1:1,000 dilution in TBS-N (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl and 0.1% Nonidet P-40). Purification and Expression of YFP-IL-6 in Insect Cells—High five (H5) insect cells (Invitrogen) were cultured at 27 °C in Sf-900II medium (Invitrogen) containing 2 μg/ml blasticidin. To stably transfect the cells with an expression plasmid coding for YFP-IL-6, the Cellfectin method (Invitrogen) was used. 72 h after seeding of the stably transfected cells, the supernatants were harvested, and subsequently cell debris was removed by centrifugation and sterile filtration. YFP-IL-6 was purified from cell supernatants by affinity chromatography using immobilized sIL-6Rα. The eluates were supplemented with 0.02% bovine serum albumin (BSA) to increase protein stability and dialyzed overnight against phosphate-buffered saline (0.2 m NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 8 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mm KH2PO4). The concentration of YFP-IL-6 in the eluted fractions was determined by SDS-PAGE, Western blotting, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (23Helle M. Boeije L. de Groot E. de Vos A. Aarden L. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 138: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), and fluorescence spectroscopy. Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Samples containing YFP-IL-6 were excited at a wavelength of 514 nm, whereas the light emission between 520 and 600 nm was detected. The emission maximum of YFP at 525 nm was used for the determination of the YFP-IL-6 concentration. Expression of IL-6-RFP in Baculovirus-infected Insect Cells— IL-6-RFP was cloned as described previously (3Ancey C. Küster A. Haan S. Herrmann A. Heinrich P.C. Müller-Newen G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16968-16972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The linker that joins D1–D3 of human gp130 with D2–D3 of human IL-6Rα consists of the flexible extracellular “stalk” region of IL-6Rα (Ala323-Val362) and is therefore supposed to be of low antigenicity. An additional N-glycosylation site is introduced with the linker (Asn-Ala-Thr) (3Ancey C. Küster A. Haan S. Herrmann A. Heinrich P.C. Müller-Newen G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16968-16972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To produce IL-6-RFP using the baculovirus expression system, the instructions given by the manufacturer were followed. The DNA encoding IL-6-RFP was cut out from the vector pSVL-IL-6-RFP by XbaI and BamHI (Roche Applied Science) and inserted into the polyhedrin locus-based baculovirus transfer vector pVL1392 digested with the same enzymes. Sf21 insect cells were cultivated at 27 °C in Sf-900II medium with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were co-transfected with 4 μg of pVL1392-IL-6-RFP plasmid and 0.5 μgof BaculoGold™ DNA. Single virus clones were obtained from the cell supernatants by end point dilution. Several clones were screened for expression of IL-6-RFP in Sf21 cells by ELISA. The selected virus clone was then amplified by infecting Sf158 cells cultivated at 27 °C in serum-free Sf-900II medium. For protein expression, exponentially growing Sf158 cells were infected with the recombinant IL-6-RFP baculovirus. Three days after infection, the cell supernatant containing IL-6-RFP (∼1 μg/ml) was harvested and cleaned from cells and cellular debris by centrifugation and sterile filtration. Purification of IL-6-RFP by Affinity Chromatography—IL-6-RFP was purified from Sf158 supernatants by affinity chromatography with IL-6 immobilized to CNBr-Sepharose (Amer-sham Biosciences). After applying the cell supernatants to the column and washing with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20, proteins were eluted with 1 m acetic acid and subsequently neutralized by 2 m Tris-HCl (pH 9). Fractions collected during affinity chromatography were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, silver-staining, Western blotting, and immunodetection with antibodies directed against sIL-6Rα or FLAG (Sigma). The eluates were supplemented with 0.02% BSA (200 μg/ml) and dialyzed overnight against phosphate-buffered saline. The final concentration of purified IL-6-RFP was ∼10 μg/ml at a yield of ∼70%. IL-6-RFP was stored for up to three years at -20 °C without major loss of activity. Quantification of IL-6-RFP by ELISA—An ELISA for the quantification of FLAG-tagged IL-6-RFP was carried out as described previously (9Müller-Newen G. Küster A. Hemmann U. Keul R. Horsten U. Martens A. Graeve L. Wijdenes J. Heinrich P.C. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6347-6355PubMed Google Scholar). The ELISA plates were coated with 0.3 μg/ml FLAG monoclonal antibody (Sigma), and 50 ng/ml biotinylated monoclonal antibody B-T2 (Diaclone, Besançon, France) was used as the secondary antibody. The standard curve was obtained by 2-fold serial dilutions of sgp130-FLAG expressed in COS-7 cells and calibrated by sgp130 ELISA (9Müller-Newen G. Küster A. Hemmann U. Keul R. Horsten U. Martens A. Graeve L. Wijdenes J. Heinrich P.C. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6347-6355PubMed Google Scholar). Blue Native PAGE and Detection of Fluorescence of YFP—To allow complex formation, YFP-IL-6 and IL-6-RFP (or YFPIL-6, sIL-6Rα, and sgp130) were incubated for 30 min at room temperature at molar ratios as indicated. Complexes were separated by blue native PAGE (24Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1918) Google Scholar, 25Sadtler S. Laube B. Lashub A. Nicke A.

The cathode buffer was composed of 50 mm tricine, 15 mm Bistris, and 0.002% Coomassie Brilliant Blue® G 250 (Serva, Heidelberg, Germany), whereas the anode buffer contained 50 mm Bistris/HCl, pH 7. BSA was used as molecular weight marker protein. In addition, BSA was utilized as an internal marker protein, because YFP-IL-6 and IL-6-RFP were supplemented with BSA to increase protein stability. The fluorescence of YFP was detected with a Typhoon gel imager (Amersham Biosciences) using an excitation at 488 nm, whereas the emission was detected using a 500–540 nm band-pass filter. After detection, the gels were fixed and silver-stained. Live Cell Imaging by Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy— Confocal microscopy of living cells was carried out using a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta confocal laser-scanning microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany) equipped with an argon laser, a 63×/1.2 aperture water-corrected objective, an open cell cultivation chamber (Pecon, Erbach, Germany), and a CO2 incubation and heating unit (Zeiss). For live cell imaging, COS-7 cells were transfected with pSVL-gp130id-CFP coding for an internalization-deficient mutant of gp130 fused to CFP (26Giese B. Roderburg C. Sommerauer M. Wortmann S.B. Metz S. Heinrich P.C. Müller-Newen G. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 5129-5140Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Subsequently, cells were seeded onto 42-mm glass coverslips, and 48 h after transfection, coverslips were placed into the open cell cultivation chamber. The CO2 incubation and heating unit maintained a constant CO2 amount of 5% and a temperature of 37 °C. For recording of multiple fluorescence signals from one cell, the multitrack function of the LSM 510 Meta microscope was used. Cyan fluorescence was excited with λ = 458 nm (5% transmission) and detected after a band-pass filter BP 480/20. Yellow fluorescence was excited with λ = 514 nm (5% transmission) and a band-pass filter BP 530–600 was used. All images represent confocal slices of ∼1 μm. Cells were co-stimulated with 240 ng/ml YFP-IL-6 and 3 μg/ml sIL-6Rα, and CFP and YFP fluorescence was measured every 4 min over 1 h. In a second approach, a 10-fold molar excess of IL-6-RFP over YFP-IL-6 was added to the cells 21 min after co-stimulation. Gel Filtration—Gel filtration was carried out at 4 °C with a Superdex 200 16/60 column (Amersham Biosciences) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. During each run, the light absorption at 280 nm was measured. The column was calibrated with 9 mg of a gel filtration standard protein mixture containing thyroglobulin (670 kDa), γ-globulin (158 kDa), ovalbumin (44 kDa), myoglobin (17 kDa), and vitamin B12 (1.35 kDa) (Bio-Rad). During gel filtration of YFP-IL-6 and the YFP-IL-6·IL-6-RFP complex, 3-ml fractions were collected. IL-6-RFP Inhibits Acute Phase Protein Gene Induction and STAT3 Activation by IL-6 but Not by the Related Cytokines OSM and LIF—Human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2) respond to IL-6, OSM, and LIF stimulation with the induction of acute phase protein genes (27Heinrich P.C. Castell J.V. Andus T. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 621-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (2321) Google Scholar) and are therefore well suited to test the specificity of IL-6-RFP. As shown in Fig. 1A, IL-6-RFP concentration-dependently inhibited the induction of the α2 macroglobulin (α2M) promoter by IL-6 in a reporter gene assay. A 2-fold molar excess of IL-6-RFP over IL-6 led to a reduction of the biological response of ∼70%. A >10-fold molar excess suppressed gene induction to nearly basal levels. At concentrations of IL-6-RFP, which completely inhibited IL-6 activity, gene induction by OSM was not disturbed (Fig. 1B). At a 30-fold molar excess of IL-6-RFP over LIF, LIF activity was not affected. A moderate inhibition of LIF activity was observed at a 60-fold excess. Fig. 1C shows that IL-6-RFP acts on IL-6-mediated reporter gene induction not only after preincubation of the cytokine and the inhibitor (procedure a) but also when the inhibitor is given simultaneously (procedures b and c) or with a delay of 10 min (procedure d)or 20 min (procedure e). Reporter gene induction was measured 16 h after cytokine stimulation, whereas STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation could be detected within minutes (Fig. 1D). STAT3 activation was inhibited when IL-6 and IL-6-RFP were preincubated for 30 min (procedure a) or added simultaneously (procedure c). In this short term assay, a delay of the action of IL-6-RFP was not tolerated (procedures d and e). IL-6-RFP did not interfere with STAT3 activation induced by LIF or OSM (Fig. 1E). Analysis of the Interaction between IL-6 and IL-6-RFP by a Fluorescence Gel Shift Assay—Although the bioactivity of IL-6-RFP has been analyzed in detail (Fig. 1) (3Ancey C. Küster A. Haan S. Herrmann A. Heinrich P.C. Müller-Newen G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16968-16972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), the complex formation of IL-6-RFP and IL-6 has not been studied. In a recent publication, we have shown that fusion of the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) to the N terminus of IL-6 does not affect its bioactivity (26Giese B. Roderburg C. Sommerauer M. Wortmann S.B. Metz S. Heinrich P.C. Müller-Newen G. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 5129-5140Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The fluorescent cytokine YFP-IL-6 was expressed in insect cells and purified by affinity chromatography. For stabilization of diluted solutions of YFP-IL-6, BSA was added. Different amounts of YFP-IL-6/BSA were loaded onto a non-denaturing polyacrylamide gradient gel, and electrophoresis was performed under blue native PAGE conditions. When the wet gel was analyzed by a fluorescence scanner, YFP-IL-6 was readily detectable as two separate bands (Fig. 2A, upper panel, lanes 2 and 3). Subsequently, the same gel was silver-stained (Fig. 2A, lower panel). At the higher concentration (120 ng), the upper YFP-IL-6 band is clearly visible (Fig. 2A, filled triangle, lane 2), whereas the lower one is only weakly stained (open triangle, lane 2). At the lower concentration (24 ng) (Fig. 2A, lane 3), YFP-IL-6 is hardly visible. Thus, the sensitivity of the fluorescence detection was similar or even exceeded the sensitivity of a silver stain. In lane 1, albumin alone was loaded onto the gel. The albumin monomer (65 kDa) is the strongest band, but the dimer (130 kDa), trimer (195 kDa), and tetramer (260 kDa) are also clearly detectable. These bands serve as molecular mass markers. The calculated molecular mass of YFPIL-6 is 46 kDa. Therefore, the band between the albumin dimer (130 kDa) and the albumin monomer (65 kDa) corresponds to a dimer of YFP-IL-6 (92 kDa), whereas the lower band represents the monomer (46 kDa). The addition of IL-6-RFP to YFPIL-6 resulted in a marked shift of the fluorescent band, which indicates complex formation of YFP-IL-6 with IL-6-RFP (Fig. 2A, lanes 4–6). We often observed that the band shift was accompanied with a considerable increase in fluorescence intensity. We attribute this phenomenon to quenching or dequenching of the fluorescence, dependent on varying local concentrations of Coomassie, salts, and polyacrylamide in the gradient gel. A 2-fold molar excess of IL-6-RFP was sufficient to trap YFP-IL-6 completely (lane 4). Still at a"
https://openalex.org/W2085834708,"Gold compounds are among the oldest disease-modifying drugs and are still widely used today for treating rheumatoid arthritis. Despite decades of use, little is known about the mode of action of this class of drugs. Here we have demonstrated that aurothiomalate (AuTM) suppresses hyaluronan accumulation by blocking interleukin (IL)-1β-induced hyaluronan synthase-1 transcription. We have further demonstrated that, in fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs), AuTM acts as a specific COX-2 transcriptional repressor in that IL-1β-induced COX-2 transcription is blocked, whereas COX-1 transcription and translation is unaffected. As a consequence, PGE2 levels released by FLS are dose-dependently reduced in cells exposed to AuTM. Of similar importance is the demonstration that AuTM does block NFκB-DNA interaction. In addition, two other transcription factors implicated in inflammatory events, namely AP-1 and STAT3, are blocked as well. The effect on NFκB likely explains the inhibition of COX-2 as well as that of HAS1, as both are genes that depend on the activation of NFκB. Interestingly, AuTM does not interfere with IL-1β-induced IκBα degradation, in most cases a prerequisite for subsequent NFκB activation. Furthermore, evidence is presented that, in FLS, AuTM blocks NFκB-DNA interaction neither by binding to NFκB binding sites nor by interacting with activated NFκB proteins. Taken together, AuTM treatment of FLS blocks two of the most important proinflammatory events that are associated with rheumatoid arthritis. AuTM blocks the release of PGE2 and prevents the activation of NFκB, therefore blocking IL-1β-induced hyaluronan accumulation and likely a series of other pro-inflammatory NFκB-dependent genes.

Muller-Ladner U. Gay R.E. Gay S. Arthritis Res. 2000; 2: 361-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Although it is well established that a reactive immune system contributes to the inflamed synovium, e.g. by the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor α and interleukin-1β (IL-1β), several clinical as well as experimental studies point at FLS as a likely trigger of the pathogenesis of RA. The severe combined immunodeficiency mouse model of RA and a series of other experimental studies provide ample evidence that altered FLSs are capable of initiating RA in the absence of a functioning immune system (2Muller-Ladner U. Kriegsmann J. Franklin B.N. Matsumoto S. Geiler T. Gay R.E. Gay S. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 149: 1607-1615PubMed Google Scholar, 3Han Z. Boyle D.L. Chang L. Bennett B. Karin M. Yang L. Manning A.M. Firestein G.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). One characteristic feature of RA is the amount of hyaluronan (HA) found in the synovium (4Engstrom-Laurent A. J. Intern. Med. 1997; 242: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 5Laurent T.C. Fraser J.R. Laurent U.B. Engstrom-Laurent A. Acta Orthop. Scand. Suppl. 1995; 266: 116-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It has long been known that HA effusion is indeed a very sensitive marker for dysfunctional, altered connective tissue (6Castor C.W. Prince R.K. Hazelton M.J. Arthritis Rheum. 1966; 9: 783-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In joints, FLSs are the main source of the glycosaminoglycan molecule HA. HA forms only a fine layer in healthy joints. In RA-affected joints, however, total concentrations of HA can be enormous. Consequently, it has been suggested that plasma levels of HA could serve as a reliable marker for RA disease progression (7Laurent T.C. Laurent U.B. Fraser J.R. Ann. Med. 1996; 28: 241-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Although controlled HA release is certainly essential for proper joint function, unfettered HA release is associated with a series of detrimental effects. HA fragments, readily created in an inflamed environment, possess chemoattractant properties, induce angiogenesis, and activate pro-inflammatory genes (8West D.C. Hampson I.N. Arnold F. Kumar S. Science. 1985; 228: 1324-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar, 9Noble P.W. Matrix Biol. 2002; 21: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Among the many detrimental effects of HA fragments are the activation of NFκB, the stimulation of dendritic cells, as well as the activation of chemokines (10Jiang D. Liang J. Fan J. Yu S. Chen S.

Med. 2002; 195: 99-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar). HA surface expression also facilitates cell migration by acting as the major ligand for CD44 (16Pure E. Cuff C.A. Trends Mol. Med. 2001; 7: 213-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). In the later stages of RA, radicals released by activated cells will also drive HA degradation, further fueling inflammation. All of these factors make unfettered HA release highly undesirable but also point at HA-encoding genes as possible targets for medical intervention to interrupt the cycle leading to joint destruction. In mammals, three genes encoding for plasma membrane protein are responsible for HA synthesis (17Weigel P.H. Hascall V.C. Tammi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13997-14000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). As demonstrated earlier, in FLS, the hyaluronan synthase genes HAS2 and HAS3 are constitutively activated, and HAS1 can be readily induced by a series of cytokines (18Stuhlmeier K.M. Pollaschek C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8753-8760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We have shown that the p38-mitogen-activated protein kinase plays an essential role in cytokine-induced HAS1 transcription and demonstrated the effectiveness of glucocorticoids in reducing HA synthesis in FLS (18Stuhlmeier K.M. Pollaschek C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8753-8760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 19Stuhlmeier K.M. Pollaschek C. Rheumatology (Oxf.). 2004; 43: 164-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We further tested a series of drugs that have been successfully used to ameliorate RA. In the following, we tested the gold compound aurothiomalate (AuTM) for its effectiveness as an inhibitor of IL-1β-induced HA accumulation and studied the mechanisms that might account for the effectiveness of gold as one of the oldest disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. The rational use of gold in medicine began in the early 20th century when Robert Koch discovered that a gold compound can kill the bacteria that cause tuberculosis. In 1929, Forestier (believing that RA was related to tuberculosis) was the first to pioneer the use of gold injections as a treatment for RA (20Forestier J. Lancet. 1934; ii: 646-652Abstract Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Despite their many side effects, gold compounds are still in use today and, as demonstrated again by a very recent report (21Lehman A.J. Esdaile J.M. Klinkhoff A.V. Grant E. Fitzgerald A. Canvin J. Arthritis Rheum. 2005; 52: 1360-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), can indeed be of great benefit for RA patients. Despite the long term use of gold compounds as a remedy for RA, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that account for AuTM effects. Here we have studied the effectiveness of AuTM as a suppressor of IL-1β-induced HA accumulation in cells that are of significant importance for this disease. With regard to the mechanisms of AuTM-mediated anti-inflammatory effects, our experimental data support the concept that AuTM acts as a COX-2 transcriptional repressor and blocks the activation of a series of transcription factors involved in inflammatory responses. Reagents—If not stated otherwise, reagents such as IL-1β, AuTM, and cell culture media, etc. were from Sigma (Vienna, Austria). HA enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was from Corgenix, (Westminster, Colorado). PGE2 ELISA and COX-2 antibodies were from Cayman Chemical Company Europe, (Tallinn, Estonia). Phosphospecific and non-phosphospecific antibodies (c-Jun, c-Fos, STAT3, IκBα, and COX-1) were from Cell Signaling Technology, (Beverly, MA). Oligonucleotides for electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) experiments and antibodies for supershifts were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, (Santa Cruz, CA). Cell Culture—Human FLSs (type-B synoviocytes) were purchased from Dominion Pharmakine, (Derio, Bizkaia, Spain) or were isolated and cultured in our laboratory as previously described (18Stuhlmeier K.M. Pollaschek C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8753-8760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In brief, FLSs were propagated in T75 tissue culture flasks or culture dishes (Iwaki, Funabashi, Chiba, Japan) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine, and 50 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. For experiments, FLSs were detached using trypsin and transferred to 6- or 24-well plates (Iwaki, Funabashi). For ELISA experiments, FLSs were cultured in 24-well plates, in 6-well plates for reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and in 10-cm dishes for EMSA experiments, respectively. SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—Cells were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and subsequently dissolved in SDS sample buffer (5 mmol/liter Tris/HCl (pH 6.8), 2% w/v SDS, 10% glycerol, 50 mmol/liter dithiothreitol, 0.01% w/v bromphenol blue). Aliquots of whole cell protein extracts (10–25 μl/well) were separated on minigels. Proteins were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Biosciences) using a semidry apparatus (Bio-Rad) and processed exactly as described in the provided protocols (Cell Signaling Technology). Proteins were made visible using LumiGLO (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and Kodak BioMax MR films or the chemiluminescence detection device GeneGnome (Syngene, Cambridge, UK). RNA Isolation and RT-PCR—RNA isolation, RT-PCR, quality controls, and quantifications were done as described previously (18Stuhlmeier K.M. Pollaschek C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8753-8760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 22Stuhlmeier K.M. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 7376-7382Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Small aliquots of RNA were used to check the quality of RNA using agarose gel and ethidium bromide or Vistagreen (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for visualization. First strand cDNA synthesis was performed exactly as described by the supplier of the RT-PCR kit (Amersham Biosciences). Aliquots were used for PCR. Primer sequences and experimental conditions for conventional block cycler RT-PCR as well as for real time RT-PCR have been described in detail elsewhere (22Stuhlmeier K.M. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 7376-7382Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 23Stuhlmeier K.M. Pollaschek C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42766-42773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Each RT-PCR experiment included a dissociation curve to verify the specificity of the amplicon as well as no-template controls. EMSA—Nuclear extracts from FLS were prepared essentially as described previously (24Stuhlmeier K.M. Tarn C. Csizmadia V. Bach F.H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 1417-1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The consensus oligonucleotides purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology or from Promega (Mannheim, Germany) were as follows: AP-1 (5′-CGC TTG ATG AGT CAG CCG GAA-3′), AP-2 (5′-GAT CGA ACT GAC CGC CCG CGG CCC GT-3′), NFκB(5′-AGT TGA GGG GAC TTT CCC AGG C-3′), cAMP response element (5′-AGA GAT TGC CTG ACG TCA GAG AGC TAG-3′), and SP-1 (5′-ATT CGA TCG GGG CGG GGC GAG C-3′). The double-stranded oligonucleotides were end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. After labeling and purification by chromatography, 5 μg of nuclear extract was incubated with 100,000 cpm of labeled probe in the presence of 1.5 μg of poly(dI-dC) at room temperature for 20 min followed by separation of this mixture on a 6% polyacrylamide gel in Tris/glycine/EDTA buffer at pH 8.5. For supershift and competition experiments, nuclear protein extract (5 μg) was added to tubes containing all of the binding buffer components (100 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% Tween 20, 25% glycerol) including poly(dI-dC). Where indicated, 1 μl of unlabeled oligonucleotides or 1 μl(2 μg) of an antibody solution was added together with nuclear extract. The resulting reaction mixtures were incubated for 30 min at room temperature after which labeled oligonucleotides were added. For nonspecific competition, 7 pmol of double-stranded oligonucleotides were used. The following antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used for supershift experiments NFκB p50 (C-19)X sc-1190X, NFκB p52 (K-27)X sc-298X, NFκB p65 (A)X sc-109X, c-Rel (B-6)X sc-6955X, STAT3 (H-190)X sc-7179X. HA Measurements—Aliquots of culture medium were removed, centrifuged (5 min at 2000 × g), and tested for the presence of HA via a procedure provided by Corgenix (Westminster, Colorado). Optical density values were used to calculate HA levels using a universal assay calculation program (AssayZap, Biosoft, Cambridge, UK). Quality Control and Data Analysis—Special care was taken to terminate PCR reactions on the conventional block cycler in the log phase of amplification. As demonstrated earlier (18Stuhlmeier K.M. Pollaschek C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8753-8760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), a series of cycles were routinely tested to define optimal PCR conditions for a given gene. Viability of cells was confirmed by phase contrast microscopy and by staining cells with trypan blue. Agarose gels were stained with ethidium bromide and scanned on the FluorImager 595 device (Amersham Biosciences). With the exception of competition EMSA experiments that were performed two times, all experiments were performed at least three times. Data were analyzed and quantitated using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). mRNA for GAPDH, actin, or both were used as controls for RT-PCR, and scanner readings were used to recalculate PCR data. AuTM Inhibits HA in a Dose-dependent Manner—As demonstrated earlier, IL-1β is a strong inducer of HAS1 transcription and HA release in FLS (18Stuhlmeier K.M. Pollaschek C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8753-8760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). First, we tested the effect of AuTM on IL-1β-induced HA accumulation by HA-specific ELISA. FLSs, grown to high density, were incubated with 0, 25, 50, and 100 μm AuTM for 24 h. Subsequently, FLSs were stimulated with IL-1β (5 ng/ml) for 16 h. HA levels were quantitated by ELISA. Shown in Fig. 1 is a representative experiment that demonstrates that preincubation with AuTM blocks IL-1β-induced HA release dose-dependently. Compared with FLS treated with only IL-1β, levels of HA were significantly lower in FLS pretreated with 25 μm AuTM (n = 3, p = ≤0.05). Increasing the concentration of AuTM further resulted in further reduction of IL-1β-induced HA release. However, preincubating FLS with AuTM for 30 min or 2 or 6 h, respectively, was not sufficient to significantly affect HA levels in the supernatant of FLS exposed to IL-1β (data not shown). AuTM Influences IL-1β-induced HAS1 mRNA Transcription—As shown in Fig. 2, compared with IL-1β-treated FLS, HAS1 steady state mRNA levels are lower in AuTM pretreated cells. FLSs were treated with 10 and 100 μm AuTM for 24 h. Where indicated, IL-1β (5 ng/ml) was added for 10 h. HAS1 and actin mRNA were amplified on a block cycler and separated on an agarose gel. Gel sections and a graph resulting from the quantification of gel sections on the FluorImager 595 device are shown. As demonstrated here, 100 μm AuTM almost completely abolished the IL-1β effect on HAS1 mRNA, and 10 μm were still sufficient to significantly lower IL-1β-induced mRNA levels. At the concentrations used, no effect of AuTM on actin mRNA levels was noted. AuTM Affects PGE2 Levels in FLS—We found earlier (33Stuhlmeier K.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; (in press)Google Scholar) that PGE2 is one of the most potent inducers of HAS1. We believed AuTM might affect PGE2 levels released by FLS and therefore tested whether AuTM exerts its effect on HA and HAS1 mRNA accumulation by interfering with PGE2 release. Levels of PGE2 in IL-1β-stimulated FLS were measured and compared with PGE2 levels in cells pretreated with 20, 50, and 100 μm AuTM for 24 h. Shown in Fig. 3 are representative ELISA data demonstrating that, in unstimulated FLSs, PGE2 levels are below the detection limit, whereas the exposure of FLS to IL-1β (5 ng/ml) for 8 h resulted in the release of 863 ± 67 pg of PGE2. Pretreating FLS with 20 μm AuTM did not result in significantly lower levels of PGE2 in the supernatant of these cells. However, increasing AuTM concentrations to 50 and 100 μm, respectively, resulted in significantly lower PGE2 levels (48 ± 5 and 72 ± 8% inhibition, respectively). AuTM Suppresses COX-2 but Has No Effect on COX-1 Translation—To account for the lower PGE2 levels observed in FLS, COX-1 as well as COX-2 protein levels were tested in cells exposed to 10 and 100 μm AuTM for 24 h and compared with untreated or IL-1β (5 ng/ml)-treated cells. COX-1 protein is readily detectable in whole cell protein extracts of FLS, as demonstrated by the Western blot experiment shown in Fig. 4. More importantly, COX-1 protein levels are not altered either through exposure of FLS to IL-1β or through the exposure of FLS to 10 or 100 μm AuTM for 30 h. However, exposure of FLS to AuTM did have a profound effect on IL-1β-induced COX-2 protein levels. Although in unstimulated FLS, COX-2 protein is undetectable, IL-1β (5 ng/ml) treatment for 8 h resulted in readily detectable levels of COX-2 protein. Preincubation of FLS with AuTM resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of COX-2 protein. Detectable COX-2 protein levels in 100 and 10 μm AuTM-treated cells were significantly lowered, namely 87 ± 18 and 46 ± 27% of IL-1β-treated cells, respectively. Also included in this representative figure is a blot stained with antitubulin as a demonstration of equal loading and protein transfer in Western blot experiments. AuTM Affects DNA-Protein Interactions of NFκB, AP-1, and cAMP Response Element-Binding Protein—Activation of the transcription factor NFκB and/or AP-1 is essential for the activation of many pro-inflammatory genes. Interestingly, cAMP response element-binding proteins may also play a role in the activation of the aforementioned transcription factors (25Matt T. Acta Med. Austriaca. 2002; 29: 77-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Testing of whether or not translocation and subsequent binding of the above transcription factors in AuTM-treated cells was affected was done by EMSA experiments. FLSs were left untreated (Fig. 5, lane medium), treated with IL-1β (5 ng/ml) only for 45 min, or were exposed to 30, 44, 66, and 100 μm AuTM for 24 h prior to stimulation with IL-1β for 45 min. As shown in Fig. 5, preincubation of FLS with AuTM resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of IL-1β-induced NFκB binding. AP-1-DNA binding complexes in unstimulated FLS are high but are further induced by IL-1β. AuTM treatment also suppresses AP-1 binding in a dose-dependent manner. Similarly, the ATF/cAMP response element-binding protein binding to the cAMP-response element is affected as well, although to a lesser degree than AP-1-DNA interactions. In addition, signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT3) binding to consensus STAT3 oligonucleotides, which was induced in IL-1β-treated FLSs, is also completely blocked at the highest concentration of AuTM (data not shown). AuTM Does Not Prevent IL-1β-induced IκBα Degradation—NFκB activation is of relevance for IL-1β-induced COX-2 and HAS1 activation (23Stuhlmeier K.M. Pollaschek C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42766-42773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Enzymatic degradation of IκB is in most cases a prerequisite for subsequent NFκB translocation, and a series of anti-inflammatory drugs have been shown to exert their beneficial effects by blocking IκB degradation. FLSs were left untreated or were treated with AuTM (0, 12, 25, 50, and 100 μm) for 24 h. Subsequently, IL-1β (5 ng/ml) was added for 20 min. As shown in Fig. 6, IκBα protein is readily detected in resting FLS (medium) and is completely degraded in response to IL-1β treatment (Fig. 6, lane 0 plus IL-1). More importantly, AuTM, even at the concentration of 100 μm, did not prevent IL-1β-induced IκBα degradation. AuTM Does Not Alter mRNA Levels of Jun or Fos Nor Does It Prevent Phosphorylation of c-Jun and STAT3—To account for the effects of AuTM seen on transcription factor-DNA interactions in EMSA experiments, a series of experiments were done that might elucidate the underlying mechanisms of this phenomenon. AuTM exerts its effect only after prolonged incubation, therefore down-regulation of AP-1-binding proteins was one possible explanation. However, real time RT-PCR experiments (data not shown) proved that mRNA levels of Jun and Fos were unaltered in FLS exposed to AuTM (66 and 100 μm) for up to 48 h, the latest time point at which mRNA levels were analyzed. Similarly, neither protein levels of c-Fos nor phosphorylation of c-Jun in response to IL-1β treatment nor the phosphorylation of STAT3 was significantly altered in FLSs pretreated with AuTM for up to 48 h. Shown in Fig. 7 is an experiment in which FLSs were incubated with AuTM (30, 44, 66, and 100 μm) for 48 h, after which IL-1β (5 ng/ml) was added where indicated. The labels “MED” and “IL-1” indicate the position of untreated and IL-1β-only-treated cells. In FLS, AuTM Does Not Prevent NFκB-DNA Interactions by Binding to the NFκB Oligonucleotide or by Binding to NFκB Proteins—A series of transcription factors were blocked as a result of AuTM exposure; therefore, a series of experiments were performed to test whether AuTM prevents NFκB-DNA interaction by binding to DNA or to members of the NFκB protein family. FLSs were stimulated with IL-1β (5 ng/ml) for 45 min, subsequently nuclear proteins were extracted and used in EMSA experiments. Shown in the upper section of Fig. 8A) is an experiment in which labeled NFκB oligonucleotides were incubated with the indicated amounts of AuTM for 1 h at room temperature. Subsequently, nuclear protein extract was added, mixed, and incubated for an additional 15 min at room temperature. Thereafter, samples were loaded on a 6% native gel, separated, and exposed to film. As shown in this section of Fig. 8, even preincubating NFκB oligonucleotides with 100 μm AuTM does not alter subsequent NFκB binding. Similarly, as shown in the lower section of Fig. 8B, preincubating nuclear extracts with up to 100 μm AuTM for 1 h at RT was without significant effect on subsequent NFκB-DNA interactions. As in Fig. 8A, this time after preincubating nuclear protein extract with AuTM for 1 h at RT, oligonucleotides were added, mixed, and incubated for an additional 15 min at room temperature. Shown at the top of Fig. 8 are the final concentrations of AuTM. The position of the NFκB complex and the free probe (Fig. 8A, free P.) is indicated on the left. In this manuscript, we present data that show that AuTM is able to block IL-1β-induced HA release in FLSs by blocking HAS1 mRNA transcription in a dose-dependent manner. Our interest in HA stems from the fact that the most prominent and early signs of RA are swollen joints. One of the characteristics of RA-affected joints is the large amount of synovial fluid containing HA and HA degradation products. Although HA has been considered to be unequivocally beneficial by many physicians, there are clear signs that HA degradation products exert a series of unwanted effects (4Engstrom-Laurent A. J. Intern. Med. 1997; 242: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 26West D.C. Kumar S. CIBA Found. Symp. 1989; 143: 187-201PubMed Google Scholar, 27Henderson E.B. Grootveld M. Farrell A. Smith E.C. Thompson P.W. Blake D.R. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 1991; 50: 196-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The strongest support for our working hypothesis that unfettered HA might be detrimental in RA came from an animal study demonstrating that prolonged injection of HA in healthy animals can cause all of the classical signs of RA (28Wang J.Y. Roehrl M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14362-14367Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In addition to many clinical reports questioning the practice of HA injections, another animal study designed to demonstrate the beneficial effects of HA injections also provides evidence of potentially profound adverse effects of such measures (29Roth A. Mollenhauer J. Wagner A. Fuhrmann R. Straub A. Venbrocks R.A. Petrow P. Brauer R. Schubert H. Ozegowski J. Peschel G. Muller P.J. Kinne R.W. Arthritis Res. Ther. 2005; 7: R677-R686Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Three genes are known to encode hyaluronan synthase (30Itano N. Sawai T. Yoshida M. Lenas P. Yamada Y. Imagawa M. Shinomura T. Hamaguchi M.

HAS1 is the only gene that is not active in resting FLS. However, this gene is readily up-regulated in response to a series of cytokines (18Stuhlmeier K.M. Pollaschek C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8753-8760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that IL-1β-induced HAS1 activation depends on the activation and translocation of the transcription factor NFκB (23Stuhlmeier K.M. Pollaschek C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42766-42773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Within the hyaluronan synthase family, HAS1 is therefore the only gene that shares a dependence on NFκB activation for its up-regulation with a large group of other molecules that are characterized by their pro-inflammatory properties (31Barnes P.J. Karin M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 336: 1066-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (4256) Google Scholar). In further support of HAS1 being a gene with pro-inflammatory properties is the recent demonstration that it mediates HA-CD44-mediated cell migration (32Wilkinson T.S. Bressler S.L. Evanko S.P. Braun K.R. Wight T.N. J. Cell. Physiol. 2006; 206: 378-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar).

HPr-Ser46-P or Crh-Ser46-P interact with CcpA and stimulate binding to catabolite responsive elements. In addition, the glycolytic intermediates fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) and glucose 6-phosphate (Glc-6-P) stimulate HPr-Ser46-P but not Crh-Ser46-P binding to CcpA. The mechanisms by which coeffector binding to CcpA is linked to differential gene expression are unclear. To address this question we mutated residues participating in the interaction between HPr-Ser46-P or Crh-Ser46-P and CcpA and analyzed their effects on CcpA binding and stimulation of cre binding by surface plasmon resonance. The HPrH15A and CcpAD297A mutations do not affect complex formation but abolish FBP and Glc-6-P stimulation. Likewise, the CrhQ15H mutant becomes sensitive to these glycolytic intermediates. Hence, the contact of HPrHis-15 to Asp-297 in CcpA is a determinant for HPr specific FBP and Glc-6-P stimulation. The HPrR17A and -K mutants are both strongly impaired in stimulation of CcpA binding to cre, but only HPrR17A is defect in binding to CcpA indicating that these residues affect allostery of CcpA.

CCR in Gram-positive bacteria with low GC content is mediated by the global transcriptional regulator catabolite control protein A (CcpA) (3Henkin T.M. FEMS Microbiol.

It receives signals representing the energy state of the cell and the availability of carbon sources and responds by binding to catabolite response elements (cre), thereby activating or repressing more than 300 genes in Bacillus subtilis (5Tobisch S.

Chem. 1992; 267: 15869-15874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to other family members CcpA predominantly requires the phosphoproteins HPr-Ser46-P or Crh-Ser46-P as coeffectors, but small ligands like fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) or glucose 6-phosphate (Glc-6-P) can also stimulate CcpA activity (8Gösseringer R.

FEBS J. 2005; 272: 2566-2577Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).HPr plays a dual role in carbon utilization. The His-phosphorylated form of HPr, HPr-His15-P, is a component of the phosphoenolpyruvat:sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS) for sugar uptake and can also phosphorylate regulatory proteins (1Stülke J. Hillen W. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2000; 54: 849-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). When HPr is phosphorylated at Ser-46 by FBP stimulated HPr kinase/phosphorylase (12Poncet S. Mijakovic I. Nessler S. Gueguen-Chaignon V. Chaptal V. Galinier A. Boel G. Maze A. Deutscher J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1697: 123-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) it assumes merely regulatory functions as a cofactor for CcpA. Crh is homologous to HPr, but it contains Gln instead of His at position 15 and, hence, is not active in the PTS. It can only be phosphorylated at Ser-46 catalyzed by HPr kinase/phosphorylase leading to stimulation of CcpA binding to cre (9Galinier A. Haiech J. Kilhofer M.-C. Jaquinod M. Stülke J. Deutscher J. Martin-Verstraete I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8439-8444Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar).The roles of these proteins for regulation are not fully understood, but their contributions to CCR in B. subtilis are clearly different: Crh-Ser46-P cannot completely substitute for HPr-Ser46-P in the regulation of many promoters, while only citM is known to depend exclusively on Crh-Ser46-P (9Galinier A. Haiech J. Kilhofer M.-C. Jaquinod M. Stülke J. Deutscher J. Martin-Verstraete I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8439-8444Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 13Galinier A.

Lett. 2003; 220: 277-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The expression levels of Crh and HPr are quite different. The presence of glucose or other PTS substrates leads to an about 100-fold excess of HPr over Crh (15Gorke B. Fraysse L. Galinier A. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 2992-2995Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Moreover, Crh-Ser46-P binds CcpA with an about 4-fold lower affinity than HPr-Ser46-P (11Seidel G. Diel M. Fuchsbauer N. Hillen W. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 2566-2577Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This is in accordance with the crystal structures of the corresponding ternary complexes, in which the residues Gln-15, Arg-17, and Ala-20 of Crh-Ser46-P form weaker or no contacts to CcpA as compared with the respective residues His-15, Arg-17, and Thr-20 of HPr-Ser46-P (16Schumacher M.A. Allen G.S.

Furthermore, the affinity of CcpA to HPr-Ser46-P, but not to Crh-Ser46-P, is increased by FBP or Glc-6-P, reducing the amount of HPr-Ser46-P necessary for cre binding about 10-fold (11Seidel G. Diel M. Fuchsbauer N. Hillen W. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 2566-2577Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).The functions of the HPr residues His-15 and Arg-17 in the PTS have been analyzed in several studies (18Jones B.E. Rajagopal P.

His-15 is the site of phosphotransfer and Arg-17 is important for binding to EI and EII (19Herzberg O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24819-24823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Herzberg O.

A role of the His-15 residue in CCR has been demonstrated, while HPrR17 mutants were not yet tested for their influence on CCR.

The β-galactosidase activity expressed by xynP::lacZ was measured in CSK minimal medium (C minimal medium supplemented with potassium succinate and potassium glutamate), in CSK medium with 0.2% xylose or in CSK medium with 0.2% xylose and 1% glucose. All cultures were initially inoculated to A600 = 0.1 and grown at 37 °C to the exponential growth phase (xynP′::lacZ) or to the stationary phase (alsS′::lacZ and ackA′::lacZ). β-Galactosidase acivitities were determined as described (21Miller J.H.

The resulting β-galactosidase activities in Miller units were normalized to the fully induced or fully activated states (100% value) of the strain with His-tagged wild type ccpA. Full induction for xynP is obtained in CSK medium supplemented with 0.2% (w/v) xylose. For alsS and ackA full activation is achieved in LB medium supplemented in 1% (w/v) glucose. The data represent average values of three different clones, respectively, with standard deviation and are confirmed by at least two independent measurements.Protein Preparation—C-terminally his-tagged CcpA from B. megaterium was expressed in B. megaterium WH419/pWH1499.

FEBS J. 2005; 272: 2566-2577Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).HPr from B. megaterium and B. subtilis and Crh from B. subtilis were expressed in Escherichia coli FT1/pWH1576, FT1/pWH466, and FT1/467, respectively, after induction at A600 = 0.4–0.6 with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyrano-side. All proteins are highly expressed upon induction and did not form inclusion bodies. The crude extract was incubated on ice with 5 μg/ml RNaseA and 10 μg/ml DNaseI (Sigma, Munich, Germany) and subsequently centrifuged to remove cell debris. A prepurification was achieved by heat denaturation for 20 min at 70 °C and 65 °C respectively, except for the Crh mutant Q15H, which emerged as instable at high temperatures. After centrifugation from the precipitated cellular proteins, phosphorylation of either protein was performed in the crude lysate with Crh-Q15H and in the prepurified crude lysates with all other HPr and Crh proteins using HPr kinase extract as described (22Aung-Hilbrich L.M. Seidel G. Wagner A. Hillen W. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Further purification was obtained by anion exchange chromatography on Sepharose QFF (GE Healthcare, Freiburg, Germany) and subsequent gel permeation chromatography on Superdex G75 (GE Healthcare). The proteins are fully phosphorylated and purified to homogeneity. The activity was assumed to be 100%. Protein concentrations were measured using a Bio-Rad (Munich, Germany) Bradford dye binding assay with bovine serum albumin as standard.Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) Measurements—SPR measurements were performed on a BIAcoreX instrument operated at 25 °C (BIAcoreX, Uppsala, Sweden) as described in Ref. 11Seidel G. Diel M. Fuchsbauer N. Hillen W. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 2566-2577Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar with one exception. Initially, cre DNA was coupled on a CM5 chip using CTAB micelles, but this method lead to varying amounts of active DNA on the chip. Therefore, about 3000 RU of neutravidin, a streptavidin analog that reduces nonspecific interactions, was coupled on a CM5 chip activated with N-hydroxysuccinimide/1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminoproply)carbodiimide. Subsequently, 75 RU of 5′-biotinylated xylAcre or unspecific DNA, respectively, was captured. The depicted overlays are representative traces. All quantitative and qualitative measurements were done at least twice and yielded reproducible data. The equilibrium constants and the mean root square deviations in Table 2 were derived from at least two titrations.TABLE 2Equilibrium constants of CcpA complexes with HPr and Crh variants from B. megaterium and B. subtilis and of the CcpAD297A mutant with HPr-Ser46-P and Crh-Ser46-PCoeffectorOrganismKD valuesWild type CcpA HPr-Ser46-PB. megaterium10.3 ± 0.3 μm HPrH15A-Ser46-PB. megaterium12.9 ± 0.2 μm HPrR17K-Ser46-PB. megaterium26 ± 3 μm HPr-Ser46-PB. subtilis4.7 ± 0.2 μm HPrH15Q-Ser46-PB. subtilis5.4 ± 0.2 μm Crh-Ser46-PB. subtilis46 ± 2.4 μm CrhQ15H-Ser46-PB. subtilis34.4 ± 1.7 μm CrhQ15H-Ser46-P + FBPB. subtilis10.3 ± 0.4 μmCcpAD297A HPr-Ser46-PB. subtilis4.7 ± 0.4 μm Crh-Ser46-PB. subtilis13.6 ± 1.3 μm Open table in a new tab CD Measurements—The protein solutions were dialyzed from Biacore running buffer (11Seidel G.

CD spectra from 20 μm wild type or mutant HPr-Ser46-P were recorded on a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter at 25 °C (Jasco, Gross-Umstadt, Germany). The spectra were processed with the program J-700 for Windows Standard Analysis version 1.50.01. The depicted overlays are representative traces. The spectra were recorded twice and yielded reproducible data.RESULTSHPr-Ser46-P and Crh-Ser46-P Mutants with Changes in Residues Arg-17 or His-15 Show Different Affinities for CcpA—We introduced several different mutations to determine the contributions of the residues at positions 15 and 17 of HPr and Crh to CcpA binding: 1) residue Arg-17 was changed to alanine and lysine in B. megaterium HPr to investigate the impact of charge and length of the side chain, 2) Residue His-15 in B. megaterium HPr was mutated to alanine and glutamate to determine the contribution of the imidazole moiety and mimic the presence of phosphate, 3) His-15 in B. subtilis HPr was substituted by the corresponding residue in Crh (glutamine) and vice versa to determine their contributions to the activity differences of these effectors. The wild type and mutant proteins were over-expressed in E. coli, phosphorylated at Ser-46, and both forms were purified to homogeneity. Native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that the HPr-Ser46-P and Crh-Ser46-P preparations did not contain any visible amounts of the respective non-phosphorylated form (data not shown). Their interaction with CcpA from B. megaterium or B. subtilis was analyzed by SPR using the corresponding CcpA coupled to CM5 chips. Binding of the phosphorylated HPr or Crh variants was initially examined at concentrations of 15 μm (Fig. 1). Non-phosphorylated HPr or Crh variants did not interact with CcpA even at a concentration of 100 μm (data not shown). The SPR signals obtained with the HPrH15Q-Ser46-P mutant and the CrhQ15H-Ser46-P mutant from B. subtilis showed similar intensities like the respective wild type proteins. Therefore, the binding constants of these mutants to CcpA were quantified (Fig. 2) and are presented in Table 2. Neither the exchange of histidine at position 15 in HPr-Ser46-P to glutamine nor the complementary exchange of glutamine 15 to histidine in Crh-Ser46-P affected the interaction with CcpA. The respective KD values are similar to those obtained with the wild type proteins. Likewise, the mutation of HPrH15 from B. megaterium to ala-nine had only a negligible influence on its affinity for CcpA. The introduction of a negative charge in HPrH15E-Ser46-P from B. megaterium, however, impaired CcpA binding drastically, so that no saturation was obtained in the titration. Mutation of HPrR17 from B. megaterium to alanine also decreased CcpA binding of the phosphorylated form. In contrast, the conservative mutation in HPrR17K-Ser46-P affected CcpA interaction only slightly. Titrations (Fig. 2) of CcpA with this mutated phosphoprotein revealed a 2.6-fold decrease in affinity compared with the wild type (Table 2). We conclude that mutation of HPr at residue 15 to a neutral amino acid does not affect the affinity of the phosphoprotein to CcpA, while the introduction of a negative charge impairs CcpA binding. The conservative replacement of HPr residue Arg-17 in HPrR17K-Ser46-P shows no influence on the interaction with CcpA.FIGURE 2Determination of KD values for CcpA: effector interactions. Left diagram, Immobilized CcpA(His)6 from B. megaterium was titrated with HPr-Ser46-P, HPrR17K-Ser46-P, and HPrH15A-Ser46-P from B. megaterium. Right diagram, CcpA(His)6 from B. subtilis was titrated with HPr-Ser46-P, Crh-Ser46-P, HPrH15Q-Ser46-P, and CrhQ15H-Ser46-P from B. subtilis. SPR response units were plotted versus the coeffector concentrations and fitted to the Langmuir equation for a 1:1 binding reaction per CcpA subunit.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)HPrH15E-Ser46-P and HPrR17A-Ser46-P Are Correctly Folded—To exclude that the inactivity of the mutants HPrH15E-Ser46-P and HPrR17A-Ser46-P in the in vitro experiments results from improper folding we recorded CD spectra from wild type HPr-Ser46-P and the respective mutant phospho-proteins at concentrations of 20 μm (Fig. 3). The spectra are identical with each other and the ones of E. coli and Streptomyces coelicolor HPr (23Van Nuland N.A. Meijberg W. Warner J. Forge V. Scheek R.M. Robillard G.T. Dobson C.M.

The CD spectra were recorded from 20 μm samples of wildtype HPr-Ser46-P (solid line), HPrH15E-Ser46-P (dashed line), and HPrR17A-Ser46-P (dotted line).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Effects of His-15 and Arg-17 Mutations in HPr and Crh on Stimulation of CcpA Binding to cre—HPr-Ser46-P and Crh-Ser46-P stimulate binding of CcpA to cre from xylA by formation of the respective ternary complexes. To elucidate the effects of the HPr or Crh mutations on the formation of these complexes, we performed a qualitative SPR analysis with xylA-cre immobilized on CM5 chips. Fig. 4 shows the stimulation of DNA binding by 15 μm of the HPr-Ser46-P variants. In good agreement with their affinities for CcpA, HPrH15A-Ser46-P, HPrH15Q-Ser46-P, and CrhQ15H-Ser46-P stimulated cre binding as well as the respective wild types. Moreover, the HPrH15E-Ser46-P and HPrR17A-Ser46-P mutants did not stimulate xylAcre binding in accordance with their reduced affinity for CcpA. In contrast, the HPrR17K-Ser46-P variant stimulated cre binding only poorly, although it bound CcpA well (see Figs. 2 and 4).FIGURE 4Surface plasmon resonance analyses of stimulatory effects of HPr mutants on CcpA-cre interaction. Sensorgrams were obtained from the interaction analysis of cre with complexes formed from CcpA(His6) (10 nm)in the presence of 15 μm of HPr, HPr-Ser46-P, or different HPr mutants from B. megaterium as depicted next to each sensorgram.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The CcpAD297A Mutation Does Not Affect the Affinity to HPr-Ser46-P or Crh-Ser46-P—Since residue Asp-297 in CcpA interacts directly with His-15 of HPr-Ser46-P (16Schumacher M.A. Allen G.S. Diel M. Seidel G. Hillen W. Brennan R.G. Cell. 2004; 118: 731-741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) we mutated Asp-297 to alanine and analyzed the influence of this residue on the affinity of HPr-Ser46-P and Crh-Ser46-P for CcpA. The CcpA mutant protein was overexpressed in E. coli, purified, and coupled to a CM5 chip for SPR analysis. Like wild type CcpA, CcpAD297A did not interact with non-phosphorylated HPr and Crh (data not shown). CcpAD297A exhibited a similar affinity for both effectors as wild type CcpA (11Seidel G. Diel M. Fuchsbauer N. Hillen W. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 2566-2577Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) (Table 2), and HPr-Ser46-P stimulated CcpAD297A binding to xylAcre as efficiently as the wild type (data not shown).Residues His-15 in HPr and Asp-297 in CcpA Are Essential for FBP and Glc-6-P Stimulation—We have recently identified FBP and Glc-6-P as specific effectors only for HPr-Ser46-PCcpA but not for Crh-Ser46-P-CcpA binding. Since HPr and Crh have a high sequence identity, we analyzed the effects of FBP and Glc-6-P on the interactions of the phosphorylated HPr and Crh mutants with CcpA by SPR. We also studied the interactions of HPr-Ser46-P and Crh-Ser46-P with the CcpAD297A mutant. The running buffers and the analyte mixtures contained FBP or Glc-6-P to avoid dissociation during the measurements. The concentrations of the phosphoproteins were adjusted to yield about 20% occupation of CcpA (40–50 RU) in the absence of sugar phosphates. Fig. 5 shows sensorgrams resulting from injections of 2 μm HPr-Ser46-P or 3 μm HPrH15A-Ser46-P from B. megaterium and 1 μm HPr-Ser46-P, 1 μm HPrH15Q-Ser46-P, 10 μm Crh-Ser46-P, or 8 μm CrhQ15H-Ser46-P from B. subtilis titrated with 5–40 mm of FBP. FBP and Glc-6-P increased HPr-Ser46-P and HPrR17KSer46-P (data not shown) binding to CcpA, but no influence was found for HPrH15A-Ser46-P, HPrH15Q-Ser46-P, and Crh-Ser46-P. Introduction of the histidine residue at position 15 of Crh in the CrhQ15H-Ser46-P mutant led to stimulation of CcpA binding by FBP and Glc-6-P. The KD value for CcpACrhQ15H-Ser46-P interaction decreased about 3-fold to 10.3 μm indicating a higher affinity in the presence of 40 mm FBP (Table 2). The sensorgrams for HPr-Ser46-P and HPrH15ASer46-P (Fig. 6) and HPrH15Q-Ser46-P and CrhQ15H-Ser46-P (data not shown) indicate that mutation of His-15 in HPr abolished FBP and Glc-6-P stimulation of cre binding. These results demonstrate that the His-15 residue in HPr mediates FBP stimulation, and its absence in Crh causes the lack of FBP stimulation.FIGURE 5Effects of FBP and Glc-6-P on binding of HPr-Ser46-P and Crh-Ser46-P mutants to CcpA. A–C, sensorgrams were obtained from SPR analyses of the interaction of CcpA(His)6 with HPr-Ser46-P (2 μm) and HPrH15ASer46-P (3 μm) from B. megaterium (A), with HPr-Ser46-P (1 μm) and Crh-Ser46-P (10 μm) from B. subtilis (B), and with HPrH15Q-Ser46-P (1 μm) and CrhQ15H-Ser46-P (8 μm) from B. subtilis in the presence of increasing FBP concentrations as indicated (C).
