https://openalex.org/W2074356752,"STATs are latent transcription factors that mediate cytokine- and growth factor–directed transcription. In many human cancers and transformed cell lines, Stat3 is persistently activated, and in cell culture, active Stat3 is either required for transformation, enhances transformation, or blocks apoptosis. We report that substitution of two cysteine residues within the C-terminal loop of the SH2 domain of Stat3 produces a molecule that dimerizes spontaneously, binds to DNA, and activates transcription. The Stat3-C molecule in immortalized fibroblasts causes cellular transformation scored by colony formation in soft agar and tumor formation in nude mice. Thus, the activated Stat3 molecule by itself can mediate cellular transformation and the experiments focus attention on the importance of constitutive Stat3 activation in human tumors."

It is characterized by daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, and striking transitions from wakefulness into rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. In this study, we used positional cloning to identify an autosomal recessive mutation responsible for this sleep disorder in a well-established canine model. We have determined that canine narcolepsy is caused by disruption of the hypocretin (orexin) receptor 2 gene (Hcrtr2). This result identifies hypocretins as major sleep-modulating neurotransmitters and opens novel potential therapeutic approaches for narcoleptic patients."
https://openalex.org/W2019937806,"An insulator is a DNA sequence that can act as a barrier to the influences of neighboring cis-acting elements, preventing gene activation, for example, when located between an enhancer and a promoter. We have identified a 42 bp fragment of the chicken beta-globin insulator that is both necessary and sufficient for enhancer blocking activity in human cells. We show that this sequence is the binding site for CTCF, a previously identified eleven-zinc finger DNA-binding protein that is highly conserved in vertebrates. CTCF sites are present in all of the vertebrate enhancer-blocking elements we have examined. We suggest that directional enhancer blocking by CTCF is a conserved component of gene regulation in vertebrates."
https://openalex.org/W2167704983,"Three mammalian hyaluronan synthase genes, HAS1, HAS2, and HAS3, have recently been cloned. In this study, we characterized and compared the enzymatic properties of these three HAS proteins. Expression of any of these genes in COS-1 cells or rat 3Y1 fibroblasts yielded de novo formation of a hyaluronan coat. The pericellular coats formed by HAS1 transfectants were significantly smaller than those formed by HAS2 or HAS3 transfectants. Kinetic studies of these enzymes in the membrane fractions isolated from HAS transfectants demonstrated that HAS proteins are distinct from each other in enzyme stability, elongation rate of HA, and apparent Km values for the two substrates UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GlcUA. Analysis of the size distributions of hyaluronan generated in vitro by the recombinant proteins demonstrated that HAS3 synthesized hyaluronan with a molecular mass of 1 × 105 to 1 × 106 Da, shorter than those synthesized by HAS1 and HAS2 which have molecular masses of 2 × 105 to ∼2 × 106 Da. Furthermore, comparisons of hyaluronan secreted into the culture media by stable HAS transfectants showed that HAS1 and HAS3 generated hyaluronan with broad size distributions (molecular masses of 2 × 105 to ∼2 × 106 Da), whereas HAS2 generated hyaluronan with a broad but extremely large size (average molecular mass of >2 × 106 Da). The occurrence of three HAS isoforms with such distinct enzymatic characteristics may provide the cells with flexibility in the control of hyaluronan biosynthesis and functions.

Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1990; 2: 839-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). The interaction of HA with various HA-binding proteins and cell-surface receptors plays important roles in regulating fundamental cell behaviors such as cell adhesion, migration, and differentiation (2Knudson C.B. Knudson W. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1233-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar, 3Turley E.A. CIBA Found. Symp. 1989; 143: 121-137PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, HA has been greatly implicated in morphogenesis, regeneration, wound healing, tumor invasion, and cancer metastasis (4Laurent T.C. Fraser J.R.E. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2397-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (2053) Google Scholar, 5Toole B.P. Munaim S.I. Welles S. Knudson C.B. CIBA Found. Symp. 1989; 143: 138-149PubMed Google Scholar, 6Knudson W. Biswas C. Li X.-Q. Nemec R.E. Tool B.P. CIBA Found. Symp. 1989; 143: 150-169PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, HA is an important structural molecule required for the maintenance of various aspects of tissue architecture and function. The physical and biological properties of HA appear to be affected by many factors including HA concentration and chain length. Indeed, high molecular weight HA at high concentrations suppresses endothelial cell growth, whereas low molecular weight HA stimulated cell growth leading to induction of angiogenesis (7West D.C. Kumar S. CIBA Found. Symp. 1989; 143: 187-207PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, viscosity of the HA gel and the ability to hydrate large amounts of water were shown to be dependent on the molecular size of the HA chain.HA is a high molecular weight linear polymer composed of GlcUA β-1,3-GlcNAc β-1,4 disaccharide units and is synthesized by HA synthase at the inner face of the plasma membrane (8Philipson L.H. Schwartz N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5017-5023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although a great deal of effort has been made to elucidate the mechanism of HA biosynthesis in mammalian cells, it has remained unclear due to difficulty in biochemical isolation of the active enzyme (9Mian N. Biochem. J. 1986; 237: 343-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 10Ng K.F. Schwartz N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11776-11783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Klewes L.

The existence of these distinct mammalian HA synthases raises additional questions regarding the potential differences in HA synthase activities and their biological significance. Transfection of HAS2 or HAS3 cDNAs into COS-1 cells led to de novo formation of HA coats as detected by particle exclusion assay, suggesting that these two enzymes are isozymes (20Spicer A.P. McDonald J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1923-1932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). However, the functional relationships between HAS1 and the others has remained to be studied to date. In addition, no information is available regarding the regulatory mechanisms of HA biosynthesis and the determination of HA chain length.In this study, we examined the enzymatic characteristics of the mammalian HAS enzymes and their products both in vivo and in vitro. The results showed that HA biosynthesis and HA coat formation can be achieved by transfection of cells with any one of the three genes. In vitro studies demonstrated that HAS enzymes are distinct from each other in enzyme stability, elongation rate of HA, and Km values for UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GlcUA. In addition, each HAS protein synthesized HA chains with different average chain lengths. The occurrence of such HAS isoforms is discussed with respect to their possible physiological roles.DISCUSSIONSince the HA pericellular coat has been suggested to be involved as the cellular microenvironment in a variety of important biological events, its formation is probably strictly controlled (5Toole B.P. Munaim S.I. Welles S. Knudson C.B. CIBA Found. Symp. 1989; 143: 138-149PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that cell surface receptors and various HA-binding molecules contribute to stabilization of the HA pericellular coat (27Zhao, M., Yoneda, M., Huang, L., Nagasawa, S., Nishimura, H., Kida, D., Itano, N., Isogai, Z., Shinomura, T., and Kimata, K.

Indeed, the HA coat formation in COS cells expressing a high affinity HA receptor CD44 has been reported to require supplementation with HA-binding proteoglycan in addition to HA (31Knudson W. Bartnik E. Knudson C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4003-4007Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In contrast, our current and also previous studies demonstrated that expression of three HAS isoforms in COS cells was at least sufficient for HA coat formation without HA receptor expression and proteoglycan supplementation (18Spicer A.P. Augustine M.L. McDonald J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23400-23406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar,19Spicer A.P. Olson J.S. McDonald J.A. J Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8957-8961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). We showed here that the HA pericellular coats of the HAS2 and HAS3 transfectants were obviously larger in size than that of the HAS1 transfectants. These results suggested that the differences in the ability to form the HA coat among these three HAS transfectants may reflect the differences in the intrinsic properties of these HAS enzymes.Comparison of the enzymatic properties among the three mammalian hyaluronan synthases HAS1, HAS2, and HAS3 may help to clarify their respective roles in HA biosynthesis and address their functional relationships. Recently, Weigel and co-workers (32Kumari K. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32539-32546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 33Tlapak-Simmons V.L.

In the present study, we also demonstrated that the mammalian HAS proteins are functionally equivalent in HA biosynthesis, since the expression of any one of three HAS proteins led to significant levels of HA production in COS and 3Y1 cells, but molecular stability, kinetic characteristics, and molecular sizes of HA were significantly different among the three mammalian HAS isozymes. As the product may be secreted through the plasma membrane, it may associate with the cell surface via the synthase to which HA can still attach. It is too speculative but interesting to imagine that the destabilization of synthase may result in rapid release of HA from the plasma membrane and in turn lead to a decrease in the size of the HA coat. Considering this possibility, it should be noted that HAS1 protein easily lost its activity (Fig. 3). Furthermore, based on the results of kinetic analysis, the Vmax values of recombinant HAS1, HAS2, and HAS3 proteins were not significantly different in the presence of saturating concentrations of UDP-sugars, whereas the Km value of HAS1 was higher than those of HAS2 and HAS3. Since the cellular concentrations of UDP-sugars have been estimated to be in the range of 10−4-10−5m (35Handley C.J. Phelps C.F. Biochem. J. 1972; 127: 911-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 36Gainey P.A. Phelps C.F. Biochem. J. 1972; 128: 215-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 37Speight G. Handley C.J. Lowther D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 540: 238-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), our results suggested that the smaller HA coat observed in HAS1 transfectants may also be attributable to its higher Km value which may cause the lower synthetic rate at cellular concentrations of sugar nucleotides. These possibilities suggested that the pool sizes of the cellular sugar nucleotides as well as the intrinsic properties of the synthases are important factors for regulating HA coat formation.It is possible that the physiological function of HA varies depending on its chain length as well as its concentration. Indeed, HA with high molecular weights at high concentrations inhibits cell growth, whereas HA with low molecular weights at low concentrations acts in the opposite manner (38West D.C. Hampson I.N. Arnold F. Kumar S. Science. 1985; 228: 1324-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar, 39Goldberg R.L. Toole B.P. Arthritis & Rheum. 1987; 30: 769-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In addition, viscosity of the HA gel and the ability to hydrate large amounts of water were dependent on the molecular size of the HA chain. However, little evidence is available regarding the mechanism by which HA chain length is controlled. The present study showed that HA chain length synthesized by three HAS isoforms varied. The results of the present in vitro and in vivo studies supported the idea that HA size may be modulated at least in part by HA elongation rate, enzyme stability of HAS, and its capacity to bind to growing HA products. It is also interesting to note that HA molecules synthesized in vivo and in vitro by HAS3 are significantly different in size. This suggested that additional mechanisms, for example, intracellular environment and accessory proteins of HAS, may participate in the multiple regulation of HA chain length. Previous studies showed that the size of HA synthesized by recombinant DG42 (frog HAS) differed markedly between expression in yeast cells (40Pummill P.E. Achyuthan A.M. DeAngelis P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4976-4981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and that in COS-1 cells (20Spicer A.P. McDonald J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1923-1932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Therefore, HA chain length may also be controlled in a cell type-dependent manner. Future studies are required to resolve these points.The three HAS proteins are considered to be structurally similar and can be divided into three domains composed of an N-terminal region, central cytoplasmic region, and C-terminal hydrophobic region. The central cytoplasmic regions are conserved among HAS proteins, and the levels of sequence identity in these domains are 75–87%. Despite sequence similarities, the three HAS proteins showed differences in their enzymatic properties, prompting us to study the mechanisms by which the HA synthetic rate and chain length are controlled. It will be of biologically great benefit to identify the specific regions and/or amino acid residues in the proteins responsible for the differences in characteristics of the various HAS proteins.Differences in the spatial and temporal regulation of transcription among the three HAS isoforms during development and differentiation, if they exist, could be important for understanding the physiological roles of the HAS proteins in these events. Previous studies have shown that the mRNA expression patterns of these HAS genes are distinct (15Itano N. Kimata K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 816-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 16Shyjan A.M. Heldin P. Butcher E.C. Yoshino T. Briskin M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23395-23399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 20Spicer A.P. McDonald J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1923-1932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). In fact, the mechanism of regulation in response to transforming growth factor-β differs between HAS1 and HAS2 genes in keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts (41Sugiyama Y. Shimada A. Sayo T. Sakai S. Inoue S. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1998; 110: 116-121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Thus, the existence of three HA synthases with different characteristics may provide the cell with greater flexibility with respect to HA functions. A number of reports have suggested that the functions of HA may vary considerably during embryonic development and in different tissues (42Brown J.J. Papaioannou V.E. Development. 1993; 117: 483-492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Fenderson B.A. Stamenkovic I. Aruffo A. Differentiation. 1993; 54: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Therefore, regulation of HA function should be different, depending on differences in developmental stage and tissues, which may be possible by controlling the expression levels of HAS proteins with different enzyme properties.In conclusion, our results demonstrated that the three mammalian HA synthases are related to each other but have distinct enzymatic properties, which suggest different physiological roles of each synthase. In future studies, we will assess the in vivo physiological roles of the respective HAS proteins by modulating expression of each by gene manipulations.

In the present study, we also demonstrated that the mammalian HAS proteins are functionally equivalent in HA biosynthesis, since the expression of any one of three HAS proteins led to significant levels of HA production in COS and 3Y1 cells, but molecular stability, kinetic characteristics, and molecular sizes of HA were significantly different among the three mammalian HAS isozymes. As the product may be secreted through the plasma membrane, it may associate with the cell surface via the synthase to which HA can still attach. It is too speculative but interesting to imagine that the destabilization of synthase may result in rapid release of HA from the plasma membrane and in turn lead to a decrease in the size of the HA coat. Considering this possibility, it should be noted that HAS1 protein easily lost its activity (Fig. 3). Furthermore, based on the results of kinetic analysis, the Vmax values of recombinant HAS1, HAS2, and HAS3 proteins were not significantly different in the presence of saturating concentrations of UDP-sugars, whereas the Km value of HAS1 was higher than those of HAS2 and HAS3. Since the cellular concentrations of UDP-sugars have been estimated to be in the range of 10−4-10−5m (35Handley C.J. Phelps C.F. Biochem. J. 1972; 127: 911-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 36Gainey P.A. Phelps C.F. Biochem. J. 1972; 128: 215-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 37Speight G. Handley C.J. Lowther D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 540: 238-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), our results suggested that the smaller HA coat observed in HAS1 transfectants may also be attributable to its higher Km value which may cause the lower synthetic rate at cellular concentrations of sugar nucleotides. These possibilities suggested that the pool sizes of the cellular sugar nucleotides as well as the intrinsic properties of the synthases are important factors for regulating HA coat formation.It is possible that the physiological function of HA varies depending on its chain length as well as its concentration. Indeed, HA with high molecular weights at high concentrations inhibits cell growth, whereas HA with low molecular weights at low concentrations acts in the opposite manner (38West D.C. Hampson I.N. Arnold F. Kumar S. Science. 1985; 228: 1324-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar, 39Goldberg R.L. Toole B.P. Arthritis & Rheum. 1987; 30: 769-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In addition, viscosity of the HA gel and the ability to hydrate large amounts of water were dependent on the molecular size of the HA chain. However, little evidence is available regarding the mechanism by which HA chain length is controlled. The present study showed that HA chain length synthesized by three HAS isoforms varied. The results of the present in vitro and in vivo studies supported the idea that HA size may be modulated at least in part by HA elongation rate, enzyme stability of HAS, and its capacity to bind to growing HA products. It is also interesting to note that HA molecules synthesized in vivo and in vitro by HAS3 are significantly different in size. This suggested that additional mechanisms, for example, intracellular environment and accessory proteins of HAS, may participate in the multiple regulation of HA chain length. Previous studies showed that the size of HA synthesized by recombinant DG42 (frog HAS) differed markedly between expression in yeast cells (40Pummill P.E. Achyuthan A.M. DeAngelis P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4976-4981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and that in COS-1 cells (20Spicer A.P. McDonald J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1923-1932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Therefore, HA chain length may also be controlled in a cell type-dependent manner. Future studies are required to resolve these points.The three HAS proteins are considered to be structurally similar and can be divided into three domains composed of an N-terminal region, central cytoplasmic region, and C-terminal hydrophobic region. The central cytoplasmic regions are conserved among HAS proteins, and the levels of sequence identity in these domains are 75–87%. Despite sequence similarities, the three HAS proteins showed differences in their enzymatic properties, prompting us to study the mechanisms by which the HA synthetic rate and chain length are controlled. It will be of biologically great benefit to identify the specific regions and/or amino acid residues in the proteins responsible for the differences in characteristics of the various HAS proteins.Differences in the spatial and temporal regulation of transcription among the three HAS isoforms during development and differentiation, if they exist, could be important for understanding the physiological roles of the HAS proteins in these events. Previous studies have shown that the mRNA expression patterns of these HAS genes are distinct (15Itano N. Kimata K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 816-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 16Shyjan A.M. Heldin P. Butcher E.C. Yoshino T. Briskin M.J. J. Biol.

In fact, the mechanism of regulation in response to transforming growth factor-β differs between HAS1 and HAS2 genes in keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts (41Sugiyama Y. Shimada A. Sayo T. Sakai S. Inoue S. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1998; 110: 116-121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Thus, the existence of three HA synthases with different characteristics may provide the cell with greater flexibility with respect to HA functions. A number of reports have suggested that the functions of HA may vary considerably during embryonic development and in different tissues (42Brown J.J. Papaioannou V.E. Development. 1993; 117: 483-492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Fenderson B.A. Stamenkovic I. Aruffo A. Differentiation. 1993; 54: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Therefore, regulation of HA function should be different, depending on differences in developmental stage and tissues, which may be possible by controlling the expression levels of HAS proteins with different enzyme properties.In conclusion, our results demonstrated that the three mammalian HA synthases are related to each other but have distinct enzymatic properties, which suggest different physiological roles of each synthase. In future studies, we will assess the in vivo physiological roles of the respective HAS proteins by modulating expression of each by gene manipulations. Since the HA pericellular coat has been suggested to be involved as the cellular microenvironment in a variety of important biological events, its formation is probably strictly controlled (5Toole B.P. Munaim S.I. Welles S. Knudson C.B. CIBA Found. Symp. 1989; 143: 138-149PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that cell surface receptors and various HA-binding molecules contribute to stabilization of the HA pericellular coat (27Zhao, M., Yoneda, M., Huang, L., Nagasawa, S., Nishimura, H., Kida, D., Itano, N., Isogai, Z., Shinomura, T., and Kimata, K.

Indeed, the HA coat formation in COS cells expressing a high affinity HA receptor CD44 has been reported to require supplementation with HA-binding proteoglycan in addition to HA (31Knudson W. Bartnik E. Knudson C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4003-4007Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In contrast, our current and also previous studies demonstrated that expression of three HAS isoforms in COS cells was at least sufficient for HA coat formation without HA receptor expression and proteoglycan supplementation (18Spicer A.P. Augustine M.L. McDonald J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23400-23406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar,19Spicer A.P. Olson J.S. McDonald J.A. J Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8957-8961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). We showed here that the HA pericellular coats of the HAS2 and HAS3 transfectants were obviously larger in size than that of the HAS1 transfectants. These results suggested that the differences in the ability to form the HA coat among these three HAS transfectants may reflect the differences in the intrinsic properties of these HAS enzymes. Comparison of the enzymatic properties among the three mammalian hyaluronan synthases HAS1, HAS2, and HAS3 may help to clarify their respective roles in HA biosynthesis and address their functional relationships.

https://openalex.org/W1605667399,"We describe an electrophysiological preparation of the neuromuscular junction of the nematode C. elegans, which adds to its considerable genetic and genomic resources. Mutant analysis, pharmacology and patch-clamp recording showed that the body wall muscles of wild-type animals expressed a GABA receptor and two acetylcholine receptors. The muscle GABA response was abolished in animals lacking the GABA receptor gene unc-49. One acetylcholine receptor was activated by the nematocide levamisole. This response was eliminated in mutants lacking either the unc-38 or unc-29 genes, which encode alpha and non-alpha acetylcholine receptor subunits, respectively. The second, previously undescribed, acetylcholine receptor was activated by nicotine, desensitized rapidly and was selectively blocked by dihydro-beta-erythroidine, thus explaining the residual motility of unc-38 and unc-29 mutants. By recording spontaneous endogenous currents and selectively eliminating each of these receptors, we demonstrated that all three receptor types function at neuromuscular synapses."

https://openalex.org/W2126162952,"SNAREs and Rab GTPases cooperate in vesicle transport through a mechanism yet poorly understood. We now demonstrate that the Rab5 effectors EEA1 and Rabaptin-5/Rabex-5 exist on the membrane in high molecular weight oligomers, which also contain NSF. Oligomeric assembly is modulated by the ATPase activity of NSF. Syntaxin 13, the t-SNARE required for endosome fusion, is transiently incorporated into the large oligomers via direct interactions with EEA1. This interaction is required to drive fusion, since both dominant-negative EEA1 and synthetic peptides encoding the FYVE Zn2+ finger hinder the interaction and block fusion. We propose a novel mechanism whereby oligomeric EEA1 and NSF mediate the local activation of syntaxin 13 upon membrane tethering and, by analogy with viral fusion proteins, coordinate the assembly of a fusion pore."
https://openalex.org/W1498099361,"The role of molecular chaperones in assisting the folding of newly synthesized proteins in the cytosol is poorly understood. In Escherichia coli, GroEL assists folding of only a minority of proteins and the Hsp70 homologue DnaK is not essential for protein folding or cell viability at intermediate growth temperatures. The major protein associated with nascent polypeptides is ribosome-bound trigger factor, which displays chaperone and prolyl isomerase activities in vitro. Here we show that delta tig::kan mutants lacking trigger factor have no defects in growth or protein folding. However, combined delta tig::kan and delta dnaK mutations cause synthetic lethality. Depletion of DnaK in the delta tig::kan mutant results in massive aggregation of cytosolic proteins. In delta tig::kan cells, an increased amount of newly synthesized proteins associated transiently with DnaK. These findings show in vivo activity for a ribosome-associated chaperone, trigger factor, in general protein folding, and functional cooperation of this protein with a cytosolic Hsp70. Trigger factor and DnaK cooperate to promote proper folding of a variety of E. coli proteins, but neither is essential for folding and viability at intermediate growth temperatures."

These experiments used immunoprecipitation and immunoassay procedures to characterize the signaling pathways by which VEGF induces NO and PGI2 formation in cultured endothelial cells. The data showed that VEGF stimulates complex formation of the flk-1/kinase-insert domain-containing receptor (KDR) VEGF receptor with c-Src and that Src activation is required for VEGF induction of phospholipase C γ1 activation and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate formation. Reporter cell assays showed that VEGF promotes a ∼50-fold increase in NO formation, which peaks at 5–20 min. This effect is mediated by a signaling cascade initiated by flk-1/KDR activation of c-Src, leading to phospholipase C γ1 activation, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate formation, release of [Ca2+]iand nitric oxide synthase activation. Immunoassays of VEGF-induced 6-keto prostaglandin F1α formation as an indicator of PGI2 production revealed a 3–4-fold increase that peaked at 45–60 min. The PGI2 signaling pathway follows the NO pathway through release of [Ca2+]i, but diverges prior to NOS activation and also requires activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase.

Three tyrosine-kinase signaling receptors for VEGF have been identified: flt-1, flk-1/KDR, and flt-4. The specific actions of VEGF on vascular endothelial cells are regulated by flt-1 and flk-1/KDR. Flt-1, which has higher affinity for VEGF than flk-1/KDR and is required for endothelial cell morphogenesis; flk-1/KDR is involved primarily in mitogenesis (4Fong G.-H. Rossant F. Gertsenstein M.

Nature. 1995; 376: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (3371) Google Scholar). The physiological effects of VEGF on endothelial cells are well established, but the postreceptor signaling pathways are not yet fully understood. VEGF-receptor binding triggers a signaling cascade that results in tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase Cγ1 (PLCγ1), leading to increases in intracellular levels of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (1,4,5-IP3) and elevation of intracellular calcium (6Brock T.A. Dvorak H.F. Senger D.R. Am. J. Pathol. 1991; 138: 213-221PubMed Google Scholar, 7Xia P. Aiello L.P. Ishii H. Jiang Z.Y. Park D.J. Robinson G.S. Takagi H. Newsome W.P. Jirousek M.R. King G.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2018-2026Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). The increase in intracellular calcium activates nitric oxide synthase (NOS) to produce nitric oxide (NO). NO formation activates guanylate cyclase within vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells, causing cGMP production. This NO/cGMP cascade is thought to have an important role in the vasoactive effects of VEGF. NO production and elevation of cGMP levels have been found to contribute to the effects of VEGF on vascular tone (8Ku D.D. Zaleski J.K. Liu S. Brock T.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: H586-H592PubMed Google Scholar). The effects of VEGF in stimulating angiogenesis and increasing vascular permeability also require NOS activity (9Ziche M. Morbidelli L.

Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1999; 40: 157-167PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, VEGF-induced activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade has recently been shown to involve NOS-dependent signaling events (14D'Angelo G. Struman I. Martial J. Weiner R.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6374-6378Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar,15Kroll J. Waltenberber J. J. Biol.

The NOS/guanylate cyclase-dependent activation of the MAPK cascade is thought to lead to VEGF-induced proliferation of endothelial cells (16Parenti A. Morbidelli L. Cui X. Douglas J.G. Hood J.D. Granger H.J. Ledda F. Ziche M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4220-4226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). VEGF has recently been found induce the nuclear translocation of endothelial NOS together with Flk-1/KDR and caveolin-1 (17Feng Y. Venema V.J. Venema R.C. Tsai N. Caldwell R.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 256: 192-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), suggesting a possible role for NO in transcription factor activation. Another pathway that appears to be involved in mediating the vasoactive effects of VEGF is the prostacyclin (PGI2) release pathway. VEGF induces PGI2 production via activation of phospholipase A2 as a consequence of initiation of the MAPK cascade (18Wheeler-Jones C. Abu-Ghazaleh R. Cospedal R. Houliston R.A. Martin J. Zachary I. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Although the relationship between NO-mediated signaling events and PGI2 production in the VEGF signal transduction cascade are not yet known, results of in vivo analysis have suggested that vascular hyperpermeability induced by VEGF results from the synergistic action of both NO and PGI2 (12Murohara T. Horowitz J.R. Silver M. Tsurumi Y. Chen D. Sullivan A. Isner J.M. Circulation. 1998; 97: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Therefore, the fact that PGI2, like NO, has vasodilating effects and has been shown to stimulate vascular hyperpermeability and angiogenesis under some conditions (19Yamamoto T. Horikawa N. Komuro Y.

Pharmacol. 1996; 297: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) suggests that both molecules are likely to be involved in transducing the vascular effects of VEGF. Finally, another group of signaling molecules that may be involved in the VEGF signaling cascade is the Src family tyrosine kinases. c-Src and Src family proteins have been shown to interact functionally with the transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptors for several growth factors, including platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) (21Kypta R.M. Goldberg Y. Ulug E.T. Courtneidge S.A. Cell. 1990; 62: 481-492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar), epidermal growth factor (EGF) (22Maa M.C. Leu T.H. McCarley D.J.

Waterfield M.D. Roussel M.F. EMBO. 1993; 12: 943-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). These interactions are thought to modulate growth factor signaling due to the mutual stimulation of catalytic activity and enhanced phosphorylation of downstream targets of each protein tyrosine kinase. Phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues in receptors promotes their interactions with a variety of proteins containing SH2 domains (the SH2 domain is a conserved sequence of ∼100 amino acids with homology for region 2 of Src family proteins) (25Parsons J.T. Parsons S.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). VEGF has been shown to promote tyrosine phosphorylation of several mediators of signal transduction that contain SH2 domains, including PLCγ1, phosphoinositide 3-kinase, GTPase activating protein, and the oncogenic adapter protein Nck (7Xia P. Aiello L.P. Ishii H. Jiang Z.Y. Park D.J. Robinson G.S. Takagi H. Newsome W.P. Jirousek M.R. King G.L. J. Clin.

However, although the VEGF receptors have been shown to interact with SH2 domain-containing proteins, their specific interactions with Src family tyrosine kinases remain unclear. Studies with stably transfected cell lines expressing either flt-1 or flk-1/KDR have shown weak association between the Src family proteins Fyn and Yes with flt-1 but not flk-1/KDR (26Waltenberger J. Claesson-Welsh L. Siegbahn A. Shibuya M. Heldin C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26988-26995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Work done using sinusoidal endothelial cells and flk-/KDR expressing NIH3T3 fibroblasts failed to show activation of the Src family members c-Src, Fyn, Lyn, or Yes upon VEGF stimulation (29Takahashi T. Shibuya M. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2079-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The goal of the present study was to determine the role of Src family proteins in the VEGF signal transduction process and to characterize the signaling pathways underlying VEGF-activated production of NO and PGI2. Therefore, experiments in primary cultures of bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) were designed to determine the effects of VEGF on NO and PGI2 production in relation to the activity of Src family proteins, tyrosine kinases, PLCγ1, PKC, NOS, and the MAPK cascade. GF 109203X (GFX) and U73122 were obtained from BIOMOL (Plymouth Meeting, PA). AG-490, PP2, and PD98059 were from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). The cGMP radioimmunoassay kit was from PerSeptive Biosystem (Framingham, MA). The 1,4,5-IP3radioimmunoassay kit was from NEN Life Science Products. The 6-keto-prostaglandin F1α enzyme immunoassay system was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Recombinant human VEGF165 was from R&D systems (Minneapolis, MN). Human VEGF165 has been found to be highly potent as an angiogenic and permeability increasing factor in bovine endothelial cell systems (7Xia P. Aiello L.P. Ishii H. Jiang Z.Y. Park D.J.

Anti-flk-1 polyclonal antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-c-Src and anti-PLCγ1 antibody were from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Other reagents were from Sigma. Rat fetal lung fibroblast (RFL-6) cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. Primary BAEC cultures were prepared from bovine aortas as described (30Behzadian M.A. Wang X.-L. Jiang B. Caldwell R.B. Glia. 1995; 15: 480-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and used at passages 3–6. Unless otherwise indicated, cells were grown in M199 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 unit/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and l-glutamine (2 mm). Cells were lysed in 1 m trichloroacetic acid. Lysates were used to measure 1,4,5-IP3 using a radioimmunoassay kit according to the manufacturer's recommended methods. The accumulation of 6-keto PGF1α was used as an index of PGI2 release. Confluent monolayers of BAECs were incubated overnight in serum-free M199. The next day, cultures were treated with inhibitors for 30–60 min. Then, VEGF was added to the wells for 10 min, and then 500 μl of conditioned medium aliquots were removed for 6-keto PGF1α analysis. The amount of 6-keto PGF1α in the medium was measured using an enzyme immunoassay kit according to the manufacturer's specifications. RFL-6 reporter cell assays were done as described (31Ishii K., H., S. Warner T.D. Forstermann U. Murad F. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: H598-H603PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, confluent BAEC cultures were maintained in serum-free medium overnight and then equilibrated in Locke's buffer (154.0 mm NaCl, 5.6 mm KCl, 2.0 mmCaCl2, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 3.6 mm NaHCO3, 5.6 mm glucose, and 10.0 mm Hepes (pH 7.4)). All treatment solutions were prepared with the same buffer. For experiments, BAECs were pretreated with inhibitors or vehicle alone and then with VEGF with or without inhibitors. Immediately before treatment, 0.3 mm3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine and 100 units/ml superoxide dismutase were added to the cultures. After treatment, the conditioned media were quickly transferred to RFL-6 cultures. After 3 min at 37 °C, the conditioned medium was replaced by ice-cold 25 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 3.3). Cells were frozen overnight at −20 °C. The next day, the samples were collected and stored at −70 °C until analyzed for cGMP using a cGMP 125I radioimmunoassay kit. BAECs were cultured to 95% confluence, switched to serum-free medium for 16–18 h, and treated with VEGF in the presence or absence of PP2 or sodium orthovanadate (Na3VO4, 0.1 mm). Incubations were terminated by aspirating the medium and washing the cells twice with ice-cold phosphate buffer saline containing 2 mm Na3VO4 and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were done as described previously (32Marrero M.B. Schieffer B. Paxton W.G. Heerdt L. Berk B.C. Delarontaine P. Bernstein K.E.

The data were analyzed by analysis of variance and Dunnett's post hoc comparison test for comparing several treatment groups with a control (35Dunnett C.W. J. Am. Stat. Assoc. 1955; 50: 1096-1121Crossref Scopus (5088) Google Scholar). The results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. We first investigated the involvement of Src family tyrosine kinases in the VEGF signal transduction cascade. Because tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ1 is a well established early event in the VEGF signal transduction cascade (29Takahashi T. Shibuya M. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2079-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 36Guo D. Jia Q. Song H.-Y. Warren R.S. Donner D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6729-6733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar), we tested the effects of the Src family tyrosine kinase inhibitor PP2 (37Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1790) Google Scholar) on VEGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ1 by using immunoprecipitation and immunoblot techniques. The data confirmed a VEGF-induced increase in PLCγ1 tyrosine phosphorylation. The response reached maximal levels at 5–20 min and returned to the basal level within 30–60 min (Fig. 1). This effect was totally blocked by PP2, suggesting that the activity of members of the Src kinase family is required for the response. To further test the role of the Src family proteins in the activation of VEGF of PLCγ1, we determined the effects of PP2 and the broad spectrum tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein on VEGF-induced production of 1,4,5-IP3. These experiments showed a significant increase in 1,4,5-IP3 production within 2 min of VEGF addition. The increase peaked at 10 min and then declined, returning to control levels at 60 min. This effect was blocked completely by both PP2 and genistein (Fig. 2), indicating that Src-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation is also required for 1,4,5-IP3 production induced by VEGF, providing further evidence that a member or members of the Src family of tyrosine kinases plays a role in the VEGF signaling cascade. Previous studies done with rat sinusoidal endothelial cells and NIH3T3 cells expressing flk-1/KDR have shown that PLCγ1 is a major substrate for flk-1/KDR (29Takahashi T. Shibuya M. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2079-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Because flk-1/KDR is known to generate the major part of mitogenic signals in endothelial cells, we next tested whether c-Src interacts with flk-1/KDR by immunoprecipitating with anti-flt-1/KDR antibodies and immunoblotting with precipitated proteins with anti-c-Src antibodies. As shown in Fig.3, this analysis revealed that VEGF treatment stimulated formation of a c-Src complex with flk-1/KDR. This association was evident within 1 min of VEGF addition and increased as the treatment continued. The early onset of this effect and its close temporal correspondence with that for the PLCγ1 activation strongly suggests that VEGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of flk-1/KDR directly activates c-Src. Our data are the first to suggest that c-Src is activated by VEGF. The relationship between c-Src activation and the physiological actions of VEGF is not yet understood, but it appears very likely that c-Src activation has an important role in coordinating the effects of VEGF on growth with its effects on cell adhesion and cell motility. Tyrosine phosphorylation of receptors for both PDGF and EGF has also been found to promote formation of receptor complexes with Src family proteins, and consequent activation of Src family kinases has been implicated in cell proliferation events. For example, Src family kinases have been found to be required for PDGF-induced progression through the G1 stage of the cell cycle and entrance into S phase (38Twamley-Stein G.M. Pepperkok R. Ansorge W. Courtneidge S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7696-7700Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Analyses of interactions between the EGF receptor and mutated Src family proteins indicate that c-Src is also required for EGF-induced mitogenesis and that Src may mediate regulation of a cell cycle checkpoint (39Wilson L.K. Luttrell D.K. Parsons J.T. Parsons S.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1989; 91: 536-544Google Scholar). Src activation has also been implicated in regulation of cell motility by both PDGF and EGF due to complex formation between Src and the focal adhesion tyrosine kinase FAK, together with the focal adhesion-associated protein paxillin (25Parsons J.T. Parsons S.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). VEGF is also known to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK and paxillin (40Abedi H. Zachary I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15442-15451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Thus, c-Src may serve to link the VEGF receptor and adhesion receptor signaling pathways in vascular endothelial cells, as has been suggested for PDGF and EGF in other cell types. The next series of experiments analyzed the relationship between VEGF-induced c-Src activation and NO production. It is well established that NO-induced vasodilation occurs due to increased cGMP formation through activation of soluble guanylate cyclase in vascular smooth muscle cells. RFL-6 cells have been shown to respond to soluble guanylate cyclase activators and can be used as reporter cells to detect NO release by other cells under various experimental conditions (31Ishii K., H., S. Warner T.D. Forstermann U. Murad F. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: H598-H603PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, NO released by BAECs was analyzed by stimulating RFL-6 cells with BAEC conditioned medium and then measuring cGMP formation in the RFL-6 cultures. Experiments testing the effects of different concentrations of VEGF on NO release showed that the VEGF-induced NO release was concentration-dependent (Fig.4). The absolute measurements of cGMP levels varied somewhat between different endothelial cell isolations and batches of RFL-6 reporter cells, but VEGF concentrations of 10 ng/ml always induced a significant increase in NO release. Therefore, this concentration was used for all other experiments. The release of NO induced by VEGF was also time-dependent (Fig. 5). NO levels were substantially increased within 5 min of VEGF treatment. The increase was sustained for 20 min and then declined, but NO remained significantly above basal levels for up to 60 min. Pretreatment with genistein or PP2 completely blocked this effect. Genistein or PP2 alone had no effect on basal NO release or on reporter cell cGMP production. Control studies also showed that cGMP production was completely blocked byl-NAME and that neither VEGF or l-NAME had any direct effect on cGMP production by RFL-6 cells. These data demonstrate that the VEGF-induced increase in NO release is dependent on tyrosine kinase activity and specifically on activity of the Src family kinases. The results of the reporter cell assays are consistent with previous studies that directly measured VEGF-induced cGMP accumulation in human umbilical endothelial cells (41Papapetropoulos A. Garcia-Cardena G. Madri J.A. Sessa W.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 3131-3139Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar) and a cell line of coronary venule endothelial cells (9Ziche M. Morbidelli L. Choudhuri R. Zhang H.-T. Donnini S. Granger H.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2625-2634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Morbidelli L. Chang C.-H. Douglas J.G. Granger H.J. Ledda F. Ziche M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: H411-H415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have also obtained similar results using an NO electrode to directly measure NO accumulation within the media of VEGF-treated BAECs. 2H. He and R. B. Caldwell, unpublished observations. The change in the amount of NO in the BAEC conditioned medium must be the net result of formation, release, and degradation. The decline in NO at later times indicates that NO is continuously degraded, even in the presence of a high concentration of superoxide dismutase (100 units/ml). However, the fact that the VEGF-induced release of NO remains above the basal levels for up to 60 min after VEGF addition indicates a sustained effect of the growth factor on NOS activity. The overall pattern of VEGF release shown by our experiments is quite consistent with the pattern of VEGF-induced increases in intracellular calcium shown by previous work done in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Those studies showed that VEGF induced an increase in intracellular calcium levels that was preceded by a latent period of 15 s, peaked at ∼60 s, and was sustained for up to 90 min (6Brock T.A. Dvorak H.F. Senger D.R. Am. J. Pathol. 1991; 138: 213-221PubMed Google Scholar,8Ku D.D. Zaleski J.K. Liu S. Brock T.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: H586-H592PubMed Google Scholar). Specificity of the VEGF effects on NO release was demonstrated by experiments comparing the effects of different inhibitors on VEGF-induced formation of NO using the calcium ionophore A23187 as positive control. The NOS inhibitor l-NAME (42Moncada S. Palmer R.M.J. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-142PubMed Google Scholar), the PKC inhibitor GFX (43Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand-Perret T. Ajakane M. Baudet V. Boissin P. Boursier E. Loriolle F. Duhamel L. Charon D. Kirilovsky J. J. Biol.

Therap. 1990; 253: 688-697PubMed Google Scholar), the specific MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitor PD98059 (45Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2595) Google Scholar), or the JAK2 inhibitor AG490 (46Meydan N. Grunberger T. Dadi H. Shahar M. Arpaia E., Z., L. Leeder J.S. Freedman M. Cohen A. Gazit A. Levitzki A. Roifman C.M. Nature. 1996; 379: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar) was used to pretreat the cells before stimulation with VEGF. As expected, inhibition of NOS by l-NAME completely blocked NO formation (9Ziche M. Morbidelli L. Choudhuri R. Zhang H.-T. Donnini S. Granger H.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2625-2634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Morbidelli L. Chang C.-H. Douglas J.G. Granger H.J. Ledda F. Ziche M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: H411-H415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Papapetropoulos A. Garcia-Cardena G. Madri J.A. Sessa W.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 3131-3139Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar, 47Ziche M. Morbidelli L. Masini E. Amerini S. Granger H.J. Maggi C.A. Geppetti P. Ledda F. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 2036-2044Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). Furthermore, inhibition of PKC or PLC activity also completely blocked VEGF-stimulated NO release (Fig.6). In contrast, the inhibition of MEK and JAK2 had no effect. These results suggest that PKC and PLC are involved in VEGF activation of the NOS/guanylate cyclase pathway, whereas MEK and JAK2 are not. To determine which VEGF receptor is involved in NOS activation and NO production, we tested the effects of placental growth factor (PlGF). PlGF is a member of the VEGF family of proteins that binds flt-1 with high affinity but fails to bind flk-1/KDR (48Park J.E. Chen H.H. Winer J. Houck K.A. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25646-25654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results showed that PlGF did not increase cGMP production (Fig.7). Thus, activation of the flk-1/KDR receptor is responsible for VEGF-induced NO production, whereas flt-1 is not involved. In endothelial cells, VEGF-induced activation of PLCγ1 leads to formation of 1,4,5-IP3, which induces increases in intracellular calcium levels and activation of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (27Johnson G.L. Vaillanncourt R.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 230-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 49Berridge M.J. Irvine R.F. Nature. 1989; 341: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (3313) Google Scholar). The interdependence of tyrosine phosphorylation and calcium signaling in endothelial cells is well established (50Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Busse R. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 522-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 51Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Busse R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11009-11015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Stimulation of NOS activation and NO formation by increased intracellular Ca2+is also well known (52Prabhakar P. Thatte H.S. Goetz R.M. Cho M.R. Golan D.E. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27383-27388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). To determine the source of the Ca2+ increase responsible for VEGF-induced NO production, we studied the effects of the following inhibitors on VEGF-induced cGMP production by reporter cells: TMB-8 (intracellular Ca2+channel blocker) (53Yamada Y. Teraoka H. Nakazato Y. Ohga A. Neurosci. Lett. 1988; 90: 338-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), BAPTA/AM (intracellular Ca2+chelator) (54Tsien R.Y. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 2396-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1705) Google Scholar), EGTA (extracellular Ca2+ chelator), and verapamil (extracellular Ca2+ channel blocker) (55Atlas D. Adler M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 1237-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 8, TMB-8 and BAPTA/AM attenuated VEGF-induced NO production, whereas EGTA and verapamil had no effect. These data indicate that Ca2+ release from internal stores is required for VEGF-induced activation of NOS. This conclusion is supported by results of previous experiments analyzing VEGF effects on cGMP formation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells, which showed that BAPTA/AM totally blocked the VEGF-induced increase in cGMP (41Papapetropoulos A. Garcia-Cardena G. Madri J.A. Sessa W.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 3131-3139Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar). Previous analysis of VEGF effects on intracellular Ca2+ accumulation have shown that the initial VEGF-induced increase in intracellular Ca2+ results from a combination of influx of external Ca2+ and Ca2+release from internal stores and that sustained elevation of intracellular Ca2+ levels requires the influx of external Ca2+ (6Brock T.A. Dvorak H.F. Senger D.R. Am. J. Pathol. 1991; 138: 213-221PubMed Google Scholar). The lack of inhibitory effects of verapamil and EGTA shown in our experiments indicates that influx of extracellular Ca2+ into the cell is not required for NOS activation under acute conditions (5 min of VEGF treatment). However, influx of external Ca2+ would probably be needed to replenish the intracellular Ca2+ if treatment were continued longer. PGI2, like VEGF, is known to be involved in the regulation of vascular permeability and angiogenesis (19Yamamoto T. Horikawa N. Komuro Y. Hara Y. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 302: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 20Fujii E. Irie K. Ogawa A. Ohba K. Muraki T. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 297: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). VEGF has been shown to stimulate PGI2 production in human umbilical vein endothelial cells via activation of flk-1/KDR (18Wheeler-Jones C. Abu-Ghazaleh R. Cospedal R. Houliston R.A. Martin J. Zachary I. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). NOS activation in bovine coronary microvessel endothelial cells has also been found to increase their PGI2 production (28Davidge S.T. Baker P.N. McLaughlin M.K. Roberts J.M. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 274-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Thus, it was hypothesized that VEGF causes PGI2 production via the NOS/guanylate cyclase. To test this, BAECs were pretreated for 30–60 min with inhibitors (PP2, genistein, GFX, BAPTA/AM, PD98059, andl-NAME), incubated with VEGF, and analyzed for PGI2 production. The data showed that VEGF stimulated a time-dependent increase in PGI2 release that peaked at 45–60 min as described previously (18Wheeler-Jones C. Abu-Ghazaleh R. Cospedal R. Houliston R.A. Martin J. Zachary I. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The VEGF effect was inhibited by PP2, genistein, GFX and BAPTA/AM and by the specific MEK inhibitor PD98059 (Fig. 9), indicating that PGI2 production is downstream from PKC activation in the VEGF signaling pathway and is also downstream from increased intracellular Ca2+ and the MAPK cascade. However, the NOS inhibitor l-NAME had no effect on PGI2production, suggesting that VEGF signaling leading to PGI2production diverges subsequent to the increase in intracellular calcium and prior to NOS activation. VEGF stimulation of the MAPK pathway is well established (14D'Angelo G. Struman I. Martial J. Weiner R.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6374-6378Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), but the relationship between the MAPK cascade and NOS activation is not yet clear. Results of work done using late passage coronary vein endothelial cells indicated that the NOS/guanylate cyclase pathway lies upstream of the MAPK cascade (16Parenti A. Morbidelli L. Cui X. Douglas J.G. Hood J.D. Granger H.J. Ledda F. Ziche M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4220-4226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). However, others have also shown that activation of the MAPK cascade by shear stress parallels NO production. Our observation that VEGF-induced production of PGI2 was blocked by the MEK inhibitor but not by the NOS inhibitor indicates that this effect is mediated by the MAPK pathway independent of NOS. Based on the above results, we propose a working model for VEGF signaling leading to increased NO and PGI2 formation: VEGF binding to flk-1/KDR results in formation of receptor complexes with c-Src and c-Src activation. Activated c-Src activates PLCγ1, which leads to formation of diacylglycerol and 1,4,5-IP3. Diacylglycerol activates PKC, and 1,4,5-IP3 stimulates Ca2+ release from internal stores, which activates NOS, leading to NO production. The signaling pathway for VEGF stimulation of PGI2 production follows the above pathway though the level of intracellular Ca2+ release but diverges prior to initiation of the NOS/guanylate cyclase and MAPK cascades (Fig.10). Our model, therefore, suggests that VEGF-induced NO and PGI2 formation occur in parallel. This model, however, does not necessarily imply that direct phosphorylation or interactions occur between each of the indicated components in either pathway."

https://openalex.org/W2164503407,"Redox control of the transcription factor c-Jun maps to a single cysteine in its DNA binding domain. However, the nature of the oxidized state of this cysteine and, thus, the potential molecular mechanisms accounting for the redox regulation of c-Jun DNA binding remain unclear. To address this issue, we have analyzed the purified recombinant c-Jun DNA binding domain for redox-dependent thiol modifications and concomitant changes in DNA binding activity. We show that changes in the ratio of reduced to oxidized glutathione provide the potential to oxidize c-Jun sulfhydryls by mechanisms that include both protein disulfide formation and S-glutathiolation. We provide evidence that S-glutathiolation, which is specifically targeted to the cysteine residue located in the DNA binding site of the protein, may account for the reversible redox regulation of c-Jun DNA binding. Furthermore, based on a molecular model of the S-glutathiolated protein, we discuss the structural elements facilitating S-glutathiolation and how this modification interferes with DNA binding. Given the structural similarities between the positively charged cysteine-containing DNA binding motif of c-Jun and the DNA binding site of related oxidant-sensitive transcriptional activators, the unprecedented phenomenon of redox-triggered S-thiolation of a transcription factor described in this report suggests a novel role for protein thiolation in the redox control of transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2034678374,"Endonuclease IV is the archetype for a conserved apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonuclease family that primes DNA repair synthesis by cleaving the DNA backbone 5′ of AP sites. The crystal structures of Endonuclease IV and its AP–DNA complex at 1.02 and 1.55 Å resolution reveal how an α8β8 TIM barrel fold can bind dsDNA. Enzyme loops intercalate side chains at the abasic site, compress the DNA backbone, bend the DNA ∼90°, and promote double-nucleotide flipping to sequester the extrahelical AP site in an enzyme pocket that excludes undamaged nucleotides. These structures suggest three Zn2+ ions directly participate in phosphodiester bond cleavage and prompt hypotheses that double-nucleotide flipping and sharp bending by AP endonucleases provide exquisite damage specificity while aiding subsequent base excision repair pathway progression."

We show that DLG and CaMKII colocalize at synapses and exist in the same protein complex. Constitutively activated CaMKII phenocopied structural abnormalities of dlg mutant synapses and dramatically increased extrajunctional DLG. Decreased CaMKII activity caused opposite alterations. In vitro, CaMKII phosphorylated a DLG fragment with a stoichiometry close to one. Moreover, expression of site-directed dlg mutants that blocked or mimicked phosphorylation had effects similar to those observed upon inhibiting or constitutively activating CaMKII. We propose that CaMKII-dependent DLG phosphorylation regulates the association of DLG with the synaptic complex during development and plasticity, thus providing a link between synaptic activity and structure."
https://openalex.org/W2110753649,"Transcriptional activation of Hedgehog (Hh) target genes requires Cubitus interruptus, a 155 kDa cytoplasmic zinc finger protein (Ci155), which in the absence of Hh signaling is processed to form a nuclear repressor (Ci75). We show that Hh signaling reduces phosphorylation of Ci155, and this reduction in turn appears to decrease processing. Blocking processing with proteasome inhibitors or altered Ci proteins, however, is insufficient for activation of Hh targets. We find that Hh signaling increases the rate of Ci155 nuclear import, resulting in significant nuclear accumulation. Even in the absence of signaling, nuclear accumulation of Ci155 suffices for significant induction of Hh targets, and active nuclear export of Ci155 is an essential mechanism for maintenance of the unstimulated state."

The Arabidopsis NPR1 gene is a positive regulator of SAR, essential for transducing the SAR signal salicylic acid (SA). Mutations in the NPR1 gene abolish the SA-induced expression of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes and resistance to pathogens. To identify additional regulators of SAR, we screened for suppressors of npr1-1. In the npr1-1 background, the sni1 (suppressor of npr1-1, inducible 1) mutant shows near wild-type levels of PR1 expression and resistance to pathogens after induction. Restoration of SAR in npr1-1 by the recessive sni1 mutation indicates that wild-type SNI1 may function as a negative regulator of SAR. We cloned the SNI1 gene and found that it encodes a leucine-rich nuclear protein."

An XOptx2-Engrailed repressor gives a similar phenotype, while an XOptx2-VP16 activator reduces eye size. XOptx2 stimulates bromodeoxyuridine incorporation, and XOptx2-induced eye enlargement is dependent on cellular proliferation. Moreover, retinoblasts transfected with XOptx2 produce clones of cells approximately twice as large as control clones. Pax6, which does not increase eye size alone, acts synergistically with XOptx2. Our results suggest that XOptx2, in combination with other genes expressed in the eye field, is crucially involved in the proliferative state of retinoblasts and thereby the size of the eye."
https://openalex.org/W2142823036,"The hermaphrodite-specific neurons (HSNs) of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans are generated embryonically in both hermaphrodites and males but undergo programmed cell death in males. The gene egl-1 encodes a BH3-containing cell death activator that is required for programmed cell death in C. elegans. Gain-of-function (gf) mutations in egl-1 cause the inappropriate programmed cell death of the HSNs in hermaphrodites. These mutations lie 5.6 kb downstream of the egl-1 transcription unit and disrupt the binding of the TRA-1A zinc finger protein, the terminal global regulator of somatic sexual fate. This disruption results in the activation of the egl-1 gene in the HSNs not only in males but also in hermaphrodites. Our findings suggest that in hermaphrodites TRA-1A represses egl-1 transcription in the HSNs to prevent these neurons from undergoing programmed cell death."

https://openalex.org/W2096152337,"Tic22 previously was identified as a component of the general import machinery that functions in the import of nuclear-encoded proteins into the chloroplast. Tic22 is peripherally associated with the outer face of the inner chloroplast envelope membrane, making it the first known resident of the intermembrane space of the envelope. We have investigated the import of Tic22 into isolated chloroplasts to define the requirements for targeting of proteins to the intermembrane space. Tic22 is nuclear-endoded and synthesized as a preprotein with a 50-amino acid N-terminal presequence. The analysis of deletion mutants and chimerical proteins indicates that the precursor of Tic22 (preTic22) presequence is necessary and sufficient for targeting to the intermembrane space. Import of preTic22 was stimulated by ATP and required the presence of protease-sensitive components on the chloroplast surface. PreTic22 import was not competed by an excess of an authentic stromal preprotein, indicating that targeting to the intermembrane space does not involve the general import pathway utilized by stromal preproteins. On the basis of these observations, we conclude that preTic22 is targeted to the intermembrane space of chloroplasts by a novel import pathway that is distinct from known pathways that target proteins to other chloroplast subcompartments.

These three membranes segregate and organize a number of essential biochemical processes, including the light and dark reactions of photosynthesis and aspects of amino acid and fatty acid synthesis. The biogenesis and maintenance of this elaborate architecture requires the selective targeting of numerous nuclear-encoded proteins from their site of synthesis on cytoplasmic ribosomes to their proper suborganellar compartment. Targeting is mediated by a set of hierarchical targeting signals that are intrinsic to the nuclear-encoded protein. These signals act independently to initiate translocation of the protein across one or more of the chloroplast membranes en route to their proper destination (1Cline K. Henry R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Proteins destined for the stromal and thylakoid compartments are translocated across the double membrane envelope through a common, general import machinery as the first step in their import and assembly pathways. Envelope translocation is mediated by the cleavable, N-terminal transit sequence of the preprotein. The general import machinery consists of two oligomeric membrane complexes, the outer membrane Toc complex and the inner membrane Tic complex, that cooperate to catalyze direct transport of preproteins from the cytoplasm to the stroma at the expense of ATP and GTP (2Schnell D.J. Blobel G. Keegstra K. Kessler F. Ko K. Soll J. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 303-304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Targeting to the thylakoid is mediated by secondary targeting signals that act subsequent to envelope translocation. Translocation into the thylakoid lumen or integration into the thylakoid membrane involves at least four distinct targeting pathways (3Schnell D.J. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49: 97-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Analyses of the components involved in these pathways suggest that each of these systems evolved from secretion systems similar to those that exist in prokaryotes. Targeting to the outer and inner membranes of the chloroplast envelope involves at least two distinct pathways. Inner envelope membrane proteins contain cleavable transit sequences, and translocation across the envelope occurs with the assistance of the general import machinery. Integration into the inner membrane occurs concomitant with membrane translocation (4Brink S. Fischer K. Klosgen R.-B. Flugge U.-I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20808-20815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) or subsequent to translocation via a stromal intermediate (5Lubeck J. Heins L. Soll J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1279-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and is directed by elements contained within one or more of the transmembrane regions of these proteins. In contrast to inner membrane proteins, most outer envelope membrane proteins are synthesized in the cytoplasm as their mature forms. The signals for insertion into the membrane reside within regions of the proteins that encompass the transmembrane domains and adjacent sequences (6Salomon M. Fischer K. Flugge U.-I. Soll J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5778-5782Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 7Li H.-M. Moore T. Keegstra K.

Chem. 1997; 272: 10968-10974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Outer membrane proteins integrate without the assistance of the general import machinery or the requirement of an obvious energy source, suggesting that they directly partition into the lipid bilayer from the cytoplasm. Toc75, a component of the general import machinery, is an exception among known outer membrane proteins (12Tranel P.J. Froehlich J. Goyal A. Keegstra K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2436-2446Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 13Tranel P.J. Keegstra K. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 2093-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Toc75 is synthesized with a cleavable presequence similar to stromal proteins. The N-terminal domain of the presequence functions as a typical transit sequence to direct Toc75 to the general import machinery during the initial stages of targeting. In contrast to stromal proteins, the transit sequence is followed in tandem by a sequence that blocks complete transport across the envelope and triggers integration of Toc75 into the outer membrane. The pathway of targeting to the intermembrane space of the envelope has not been studied due to the lack of a known marker for this subcompartment. We recently identified Tic22 as an intermembrane space protein (14Kouranov A. Schnell D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1677-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Tic22 is a component of the general import machinery and is peripherally bound to the outer face of the inner envelope membrane (15Kouranov A. Chen X. Fuks B. Schnell D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 991-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). In this study, we used recombinant preTic221 to investigate the pathway of targeting to the intermembrane space. It is synthesized as a preprotein containing an N-terminal extension with similarity to transit sequences. This raises the possibility that preTic22 may utilize the general import machinery en route to the intermembrane space. We used chimerical proteins in which the preTic22 presequence and the transit sequence of preSSU were reciprocally exchanged to investigate the functional role of the Tic22 presequence and mature sequence in targeting to the intermembrane space. Our experiments suggest that the presequence of preTic22 does not function as a stromal transit sequence but directs import into the intermembrane space by a previously unidentified mechanism. Intact chloroplasts were isolated from 14-day-old pea seedlings (Pisum sativum variant Green Arrow) by homogenization and Percoll silica gel gradient centrifugation as described previously (16Pain D. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3288-3292Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). A protease inhibitor mixture (P9599, Sigma) was included at all stages of chloroplast isolation according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Isolated chloroplasts were resuspended in 50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.7, 0.33 m sorbitol (HS buffer) to a concentration equivalent to 2–3 mg chlorophyll/ml. To separate the total membrane and soluble fractions, intact chloroplasts were lysed under hypertonic conditions (17Keegstra K. Yousif A.E. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 118: 316-325Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar), and total membrane and soluble fractions were separated by centrifugation at 40000 × g for 20 min in a TLA100.3 rotor (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA). Plasmid pET21d-pTic22 for the in vitro expression of preTic22 was constructed as follows. The 759-base pair open reading frame of preTic22 cDNA (15Kouranov A. Chen X. Fuks B. Schnell D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 991-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) including the stop codon was amplified by PCR to incorporate Nco I and Not I sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. The fragment was inserted into the Nco I and Not I sites of pET21d (Novagen, Madison, WI). Plasmid pET21d-Tic22MS, encoding the mature sequence of Tic22, was constructed by amplifying the 608-base pair fragment of preTic22 cDNA from nucleotide 163 to 771 by PCR to incorporate Nhe I and Not I sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. The fragment was subcloned into the Nhe I and Not I sites of pET21d (Novagen). Plasmid pET8c-pTic22-SSU, encoding the presequence of preTic22 fused to mature SSU, was constructed as follows. A region of pET21d-pTic22 was amplified by PCR with a sense primer specific for the T7 promoter of the vector and an antisense Nco I adaptor primer (5′-CATGCCATGGCAGTCAAAGTAGCGGC-3′) annealing to nucleotides 150–174 of the preTic22 cDNA. The DNA fragment was digested and inserted into the Xba I and Nco I sites of pET8c-S (18Schnell D.J. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 103-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The resulting open reading frame consisted of the N-terminal 54 amino acids of preTic22 fused to the complete mature sequence of SSU. Plasmid pET21d-pS-Tic22, encoding the transit sequence of preSSU fused to the mature sequence of preTic22, was constructed as follows. A region of pET8c-pS (18Schnell D.J. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 103-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR with a sense primer specific for the T7 promoter of the vector and an antisense Nhe I adaptor primer (5′-GAATTCGCTAGCGCACTTTACTCTTCC-3′) annealing to nucleotides 157–171 of the preSSU cDNA. The DNA fragment was digested and inserted into the Xba I and Nhe I sites of pET21d-Tic22MS. The resulting open reading frame consisted of the N-terminal 57 amino acids of preSSU fused to the complete mature sequence of preTic22. All in vitro synthesized substrates for the import assays were generated in a coupled transcription-translation system containing reticulocyte lysate according to the supplier's recommendations (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) using T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of [35S]methionine. The translation mixture was gel filtered using Sephadex G-25 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to remove free nucleotides before use in the import reactions. Chloroplasts (50 μg of chlorophyll) were incubated in 150 μl of HS-buffer containing 50 mm KOAc, 4 mm MgOAc, 400 nm nigericin (import buffer) for 15 min at 26 °C in the dark to deplete them of endogenous ATP. The energy-depleted chloroplasts were incubated for an additional 5 min with 10 units/ml apyrase or the indicated concentration of ATP, and the import reaction was initiated subsequently by the addition of gel-filtered reticulocyte lysate containing 3 × 105 to 4.5 × 105 cpm of 35S-labeled substrate. The reactions were incubated for 30 min at 26 °C. After the import reaction, the chloroplasts were reisolated through 40% Percoll silica gel (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and analyzed by 12 or 14% SDS-PAGE and phosphorimagery. Radioactive signals in dried gels were quantitated using a PhosphorImager SI (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) with the Iplab Gel scientific image processing program, version 1.5c (Signal Analytics, Vienna, VA). The protease treatment of chloroplasts was performed by incubating the import reaction in the presence or absence of 200 μg/ml of thermolysin or trypsin on ice for 30 min. After protease treatment, the reactions were diluted 5 times with the import buffer containing 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.05 mg/ml 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone, 0.1 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin (19Jackson D.T. Froehlich J.E. Keegstra K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16583-16588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The chloroplasts were reisolated over 40% Percoll containing all inhibitors and washed two times with the import buffer containing all inhibitors. To investigate the import characteristics of Tic22, we performed in vitro import experiments using [35S]preTic22 synthesized in a reticulocyte lysate. PreTic22 was incubated with isolated chloroplasts in the presence of 2 mm ATP in a standard import assay. To assess the localization of imported preTic22, we treated samples of chloroplasts from the import reactions with thermolysin or trypsin. Thermolysin is an outer membrane impermeable protease that selectively degrades proteins exposed to the cytoplasm (20Cline K. Werner-Washburne M. Andrews J. Keegstra K. Plant Physiol. 1984; 74: 675-678Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas trypsin is capable of accessing the intermembrane space and degrading proteins that are exposed to the intermembrane space (19Jackson D.T. Froehlich J.E. Keegstra K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16583-16588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 20Cline K. Werner-Washburne M. Andrews J. Keegstra K. Plant Physiol. 1984; 74: 675-678Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that endogenous Tic22 was resistant to thermolysin but sensitive to trypsin treatment, consistent with its localization in the intermembrane space (15Kouranov A. Chen X. Fuks B. Schnell D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 991-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). In vitro synthesized preTic22 associated with intact chloroplasts, and a portion of the preprotein was processed to its mature form, as indicated by the appearance of a radioactive band with a mobility identical to Tic22 (Fig.1 A, lane 1). The mature Tic22 was resistant to thermolysin treatment (Fig. 1 A, lane 2), but 50% of Tic22 was digested by trypsin (Fig. 1 A, lane 3). The resistance of Tic22 to thermolysin was not due to inherent protease resistance because disruption of the envelope with detergent prior to thermolysin treatment resulted in complete degradation of the protein (Fig. 1 C). Furthermore, neither protease digested a newly imported stromal protein, preSSU, eliminating the possibility that the degradation of Tic22 resulted from inadequate inhibition of the enzymes prior to disruption of the chloroplasts (Fig. 1 B). The pattern of protease sensitivity for newly imported Tic22 is indistinguishable from that observed for endogenous Tic22 (15Kouranov A. Chen X. Fuks B. Schnell D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 991-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), indicating that a portion of preTic22 was translocated into the intermembrane space of the envelope and processed to its mature form. Remarkably, a significant portion of bound preTic22 was insensitive to thermolysin digestion (Fig. 1 A, lane 2). This observation suggests that the thermolysin-insensitive preTic22 might be translocated across the outer membrane but incompletely processed to mature Tic22. The insensitivity of bound preTic22 to thermolysin was not a kinetic effect because increasing the concentration of thermolysin to 500 μg/ml did not increase the degradation of the bound precursor (data not shown). To investigate the possibility that a portion of bound preTic22 was imported to the intermembrane space, we performed a time course of preTic22 import. At various time points after the addition of preTic22 to a standard import reaction, samples were removed from the reaction, and the chloroplasts were reisolated by sedimentation through 40% Percoll silica gel. The chloroplasts from each time point were split into two equal samples, and one sample was treated with thermolysin to remove surface bound precursor. Fig.2 demonstrates that preTic22 associated with the chloroplast and was processed to Tic22 in a time-dependent manner. Quantitative analysis of the import reaction indicates that the binding of preTic22 to chloroplasts reaches a maximum of 16% of added translation product after 5 min of incubation (Fig. 2, lane 6). Although the binding of preTic22 reached a maximum at 5 min, the proportion of bound preTic22 that was insensitive to protease increased from 24% at 5 min to 56% at 30 min (Fig. 2, compare lanes 7 and 13). These data indicate that preTic22 binds to the chloroplast surface and is translocated across the outer membrane in a time-dependent manner. The accumulation of mature Tic22 increased up to 30 min of incubation, reaching a maximum of 4% of the precursor added to the import reaction (Fig. 2, compare lanes 2 and 12). The processed form of the Tic22 showed a pattern of thermolysin sensitivity similar to that of preTic22 over the course of the import reaction. The processed form of Tic22 was almost completely degraded by thermolysin at the early time points (Fig. 2, lanes 3 and 5); however, the sensitivity to protease decreased with time, and 90% of mature Tic22 was resistant to protease by 30 min (Fig. 2, lane 13). These data suggest that processing can occur prior to complete translocation across the outer membrane. Furthermore, the maturation of Tic22 does not appear to be tightly coupled to translocation because the major fraction of preTic22 is translocated to a thermolysin-sensitive compartment without being processed to its mature form. We attempted to test whether the imported preTic22 could be chased to the mature form by reisolating chloroplasts from the 20 min time point and subjecting them to a second 20-min incubation in the absence of added preTic22. No significant difference between the relative pattern of bound preTic22 or processed Tic22 before or after the second incubation was observed (data not shown). Therefore, the processing of preTic22 appears to be very slow. Our import experiments suggest that the in vitro import assay reproduced proper targeting and translocation of Tic22 to the intermembrane space. However, it was not clear whether newly imported preTic22 or Tic22 associated with the inner membrane in a manner similar to endogenous Tic22. To test whether both forms of newly imported Tic22 associated with the inner membrane, we examined their distributions within various chloroplast subfractions. After a 30-min in vitro import reaction with preTic22, intact chloroplasts were reisolated, lysed, and fractionated to yield stroma and fractions enriched in outer and inner envelope membranes. Analysis of the distribution of the newly imported protein demonstrates that the majority of preTic22 and Tic22 are associated with the fraction enriched in inner membranes (Fig. 3, lane 1). Minor amounts of preTic22 and Tic22 were detected in the outer membrane fraction (Fig. 3, lane 2), and no significant amounts of either form were detected in the stromal fraction (Fig. 3, lane 3). We conclude that both preTic22 and mature Tic22 associate with the inner membrane upon entering the intermembrane space in a manner indistinguishable from endogenous Tic22. Translocation of stromal or integral inner membrane proteins across the envelope strictly requires ATP hydrolysis, whereas the insertion of most integral outer membrane proteins is not dependent on an energy source. We tested the effects of added ATP on the import of preTic22 to determine the energy requirements for translocation to the intermembrane space. To eliminate the interference of nucleoside triphosphates in the reticulocyte lysate, the preTic22 in vitro translation mixture was gel filtered before addition to the import reaction. As an added precaution, chloroplasts were preincubated in the presence of 400 nm nigericin and apyrase in the dark to deplete exogenous and endogenous nucleoside triphosphates. As controls for the energy state of chloroplasts in the import reaction, we monitored the binding and import of preSSU. As expected, 100 μm ATP stimulated the binding of preSSU to chloroplasts (Fig.4 B, lane 3). At 2 mm ATP, preSSU was imported into the chloroplast stroma and processed to its mature form (Fig. 4 B, lane 7). The results shown in Fig. 4 demonstrate that preTic22 binds to isolated chloroplasts and is processed to Tic22 in the absence or presence of the externally added ATP (Fig. 4 A, compare lanes 2, 4, and 5). However, 50% of Tic22 is susceptible to externally added thermolysin in the absence of ATP (Fig. 4 A, lane 3), whereas Tic22 formed in the presence of low (100 μm) or high (2 mm) concentrations of ATP is not degraded by thermolysin (Fig. 4 A, lanes 6 and 7, asterisks). These data suggest that the binding of preTic22 to chloroplasts does not require ATP hydrolysis. However, complete translocation to the intermembrane space is stimulated by ATP hydrolysis. Two proteolytic degradation products of 24 and 18 kDa were observed in chloroplasts incubated with thermolysin (Fig. 4 A, lanes 6 and 7). These fragments appear to represent protease-protected regions of preTic22 that result from partial translocation of the preprotein across the outer membrane. The degradation products are more pronounced when Tic22 is imported in the presence of ATP, providing additional evidence that ATP stimulates insertion of preTic22 across the outer membrane. Import of nuclear-encoded stromal preproteins requires the presence of thermolysin-sensitive proteins in the outer membrane of the envelope (21Cline K. Werner-Washburne M. Lubben T.H. Keegstra K. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3691-3696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We wished to investigate the role of surface exposed proteins in translocation to the intermembrane space by testing whether proteolytic treatment of isolated chloroplasts inhibited preTic22 import. Isolated chloroplasts were treated with 100 μg/ml thermolysin for 30 min on ice prior to the import assay. The results of the experiments demonstrate that pretreatment of chloroplasts with thermolysin decreases binding and import of both preTic22 and preSSU by 60% (Fig.5, compare lanes 1 and 2 and lanes 4 and 5). The decrease in Tic22 binding and import was not due to the degradation of preTic22 by residual thermolysin because no significant proteolysis of the unbound preTic22 from the import reaction was observed (data not shown). These data suggest that import of preTic22 into chloroplasts is mediated by proteinaceous components in the outer membrane. The deduced amino acid sequence of the Tic22 cDNA indicates that the protein is synthesized as a precursor with a 50-amino acid N-terminal presequence (15Kouranov A. Chen X. Fuks B. Schnell D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 991-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The length and charge distribution of the presequence are similar to those of typical transit sequences. To determine the significance of the N-terminal presequence in targeting, we tested the ability of in vitro synthesized mature Tic22 to bind and import into isolated chloroplasts. Mature Tic22 associated with isolated chloroplasts (Fig.6, lane 2), but the bound protein was completely degraded by externally added thermolysin (Fig.6, lane 1). This result clearly demonstrates that the N-terminal presequence of Tic22 is necessary for protein import into isolated chloroplasts. To test whether the preTic22 presequence was sufficient for targeting to the intermembrane space, we engineered two chimerical import substrates in which the presequences of preTic22 and preSSU were reciprocally exchanged. The first construct, preTic22-SSU, consisted of the presequence of preTic22 fused to the mature sequence of the small subunit of rubisco. This construct was used to test the ability of the preTic22 presequence to target a passenger protein to the intermembrane space. The second construct, pSSU-Tic22, consisted of the transit sequence of preSSU fused to mature Tic22. This chimera was used to test the influence of the mature sequence of Tic22 on translocation across the envelope membranes. The chimeras were incubated with isolated chloroplasts in the standard protein import reaction, and the topologies of the newly imported proteins were determined by their sensitivity to exogenous thermolysin and trypsin. PreTic22-SSU bound to chloroplasts, and 2% of the added protein was processed to its mature size (Fig. 7 A, lane 2). The newly imported preTic22-SSU and SSU were exclusively associated with the chloroplast membrane fraction in chloroplasts that were not treated with protease (Fig. 7 A, compare lanes 2 and 5). The membrane-associated SSU is insensitive to exogenous thermolysin, whereas bound preTic22-SSU is partially digested by thermolysin (Fig. 7 A, lane 3). SSU is a soluble protein, and it is unclear why it remains associated with the envelope membrane after processing in the intermembrane space. The simplest explanation is that SSU cannot properly fold in the intermembrane space and may aggregate in an insoluble form that associates with the membrane. Only 25% of chloroplast bound preTic22-SSU remains intact following thermolysin treatment, and the majority is associated with the chloroplast membrane fraction (Fig. 7 A, lane 3). However, 23% of protease-protected preTic22-SSU is observed in the soluble fraction of lysed chloroplasts (Fig. 7 A, lane 6). This observation suggests that imported preTic22-SSU might remain associated with the translocation machinery, but disruption of the machinery by proteolysis releases the bound preprotein. Taken together, the membrane-bound and soluble preTic22-SSU present after thermolysin treatment correspond to 23% of the preTic22-SSU added to the import reaction. The resistance of the mature and precursor forms to thermolysin indicates that both forms were imported across the outer membrane. Two partial degradation products of 16 and 12 kDa are apparent after treatment of the import reaction with thermolysin (Fig.7 A, lane 3, asterisks), suggesting that a portion of bound preTic22-SSU is partially inserted across the outer membrane and thereby protected from complete digestion. These proteolytic products are comparable to those observed in thermolysin treated preTic22 import reactions (Fig. 4 A). Both the processed and precursor forms of the chimera were completely digested with trypsin (Fig. 7 A, lane 4), indicating that the thermolysin-insensitive proteins were not translocated across the inner envelope membrane. Based on these observations, we conclude that the presequence of preTic22 is sufficient to target a passenger protein to the intermembrane space of the envelope. The preSSU-Tic22 chimera is imported into the chloroplast and efficiently processed to mature SSU (Fig. 7 B). The imported chimera is insensitive to both thermolysin (Fig. 7 B, lane 3) and trypsin (Fig. 7 B, lane 4) in intact chloroplasts and is found in the soluble fraction after chloroplast lysis (Fig.7 B, compare lanes 2–4 to lanes 5–7). These data are consistent with import to the stroma. A small fraction of preSSU-Tic22 remains bound to the chloroplast membrane fraction (Fig. 7 B, lane 5), but it is sensitive to thermolysin digestion (Fig. 7 B, lane 6), suggesting that it is bound to the outer surface of the envelope. In addition, a small portion of the imported mature protein is associated with the membrane fraction (Fig.7 B, lane 5). This mature Tic22 is not sensitive to either protease in intact chloroplasts (Fig. 7 B, lanes 6 and 7), suggesting that it represents newly imported stromal Tic22 that contaminates the membrane fraction. The import properties of preSSU-Tic22 are indistinguishable from authentic preSSU, indicating that targeting is not detectably influenced by the mature sequences of Tic22. The similarities between the import characteristics and presequences of preTic22 and stromal preproteins raised the possibility that targeting to the intermembrane space may involve components of the general import machinery. To explore this possibility, we performed a competition experiment in which import of radioactively labeled preTic22 was carried out in the presence of excess unlabeled preSSU. Unlabeled preSSU efficiently competed for the import of radiolabeled preSSU (Fig.8 A). Inhibition of import was dose-dependent, reaching a maximum of 70% inhibition at 2 μm unlabeled preSSU (Fig. 8 B). An equivalent concentration of mature SSU had no detectable effect on import. In contrast, the same concentrations of unlabeled preSSU had no detectable effect on the import and processing of preTic22 (Fig. 8, A, lane 6, and B). These results make it unlikely that the import pathways of preTic22 and preSSU share common components. In this report, we investigated the import of preTic22 into isolated chloroplasts to define the signals and pathway for targeting to the chloroplast intermembrane space. PreTic22 was imported into isolated chloroplasts, and the pattern of protease sensitivity of the newly imported protein was similar to endogenous Tic22, indicating that the protein was accurately targeted to the intermembrane space in vitro. Our results show that the import of preTic22 is directed by the N-terminal presequence of the protein. The presequence is required for translocation across the outer membrane (Fig. 6), and it can target a soluble passenger protein to the intermembrane space (Fig.7 A). Therefore, it appears to be necessary and sufficient for targeting to the intermembrane space. Recognition of the presequence appears to be mediated by a proteinaceous receptor system at the surface of the outer membrane because proteolytic treatment of chloroplasts significantly reduces preTic22 binding and translocation (Fig. 5). Approximately 20% of radiolabeled preTic22 added to the import assay was imported across the outer membrane, and the majority of the imported product associated with the inner membrane. Although import of the protein across the outer membrane was relatively efficient, processing of imported preTic22 was inefficient. Only 20% of the total imported protein was cleaved to mature Tic22 over the time course of our import assays (Fig. 2). We were unable to detect a significant conversion of imported preTic22 to mature Tic22 when chloroplasts from a preTic22 import reaction were reisolated and subjected to a second incubation under import conditions in the absence of added preprotein (data not shown). Processing of imported preTic22 therefore appears to be a slow event in the import process. The high proportion of imported preTic22 that remains unprocessed and the ability of preTic22 to associate with the inner membrane suggest that cleavage of the presequence is not tightly coupled to translocation across the outer membrane or binding to the inner membrane. PreTic22 binds to chloroplasts and is processed with similar efficiency in the presence or absence of ATP (Fig. 4). However, the amount of imported protein that was insensitive to thermolysin degradation doubled in the presence of ATP. Therefore, it appears that ATP promotes efficient translocation across the outer membrane. It remains to be established whether ATP is utilized for translocation or for stabilizing Tic22 in the intermembrane space. The fact that a fraction of preTic22 is imported to a protease-insensitive compartment in the absence of exogenous ATP suggests that translocation can occur at reduced levels without energy. This observation favors the hypothesis that ATP may be necessary to stabilize Tic22 during or shortly after translocation. This interpretation is supported by the observation that thermolysin generates discrete proteolytic fragments of the envelope-bound authentic preTic22 (Fig. 4 A) and the preTic22-SSU chimera (Fig. 7 A) in import reactions containing exogenous ATP. These fragments most likely represent portions of the proteins that are partially translocated and therefore are protected from digestion by the outer membrane. The characteristics of preTic22 import suggest that the pathway of targeting to the intermembrane space is distinct from known chloroplast targeting pathways that operate at the envelope membranes. The integration of outer membrane proteins with typical α-helical transmembrane domains, such as Toc34 (9Chen D. Schnell D.J. J. Biol.

Biol. 1994; 25: 167-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), does not appear to involve protease-sensitive components of the outer membrane, nor does integration require ATP. Upon first evaluation, the characteristics of preTic22 import appeared similar to aspects of the targeting stromal and integral inner membrane proteins on the general import pathway. For example, the energetics of preTic22 translocation across the outer membrane are similar to the requirements for the early stages of translocation of stromal preproteins across the envelope. At low levels of ATP (<0.1 mm), stromal preproteins insert across the outer envelope membrane to form an early import intermediate (18Schnell D.J. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 103-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 22Olsen L.J. Theg S.M. Selman B.R. Keegstra K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6724-6729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Translocation of preTic22 across the outer membrane required similarly low levels of ATP. This observation, coupled with the resemblance between the preTic22 presequence and the transit sequences of stromal preproteins, suggested that preTic22 translocation across the outer membrane may involve components of the general import machinery. However, the preTic22 presequence was unable to direct import to the stroma (Fig. 7 A), and the targeting of preTic22 to the intermembrane space was not competed by a stromal preprotein (Fig. 8). Therefore, the preTic22 presequence represents a new type of targeting signal specific for the chloroplast intermembrane space, and preTic22 import represents a third, novel system for targeting to and across the chloroplast envelope. The nature of the machinery involved in the pathway of targeting to the intermembrane space remains to be determined, but the identity of intermediates that are partially inserted across the outer membrane should facilitate the identification of the components of this pathway."

Additional levels of control in vivo may rely on chromatin structure that restricts access of ubiquitous or widely expressed regulatory factors, as well as facilitates synergy between transcription activators (3Naar A.M.

The chicken β-globin locus, for example, is maintained in a DNase I-sensitive chromatin structure in erythroid cells, whereas this region is inaccessible to enzyme digestion in non-erythroid cells (14Reitman M. Felsenfeld G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2774-2786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The βA globin promoter acquires an open chromatin conformation only at the onset of expression in definitive red blood cells (13Stadler J. Larsen A. Engel J.D. Dolan M. Groudine M. Weintraub H.

Thus, tissue-specific and developmental expression patterns are accompanied by distinct alterations in chromatin structure. The liver tumor marker gene, α-fetoprotein (AFP),1 displays strict tissue-specific and developmental regulation in vivo (reviewed in Refs. 15Camper S.A. Godbout R. Tilghman S.M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1989; 36: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar and 16Nahon J.-L. Biochimie (Paris). 1987; 69: 445-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). AFP is highly expressed during fetal development in endoderm-derived tissues including the yolk sac, liver, and gut. At birth, unlike other liver-specific genes, AFP expression is rapidly repressed (17Tilghman S.M. Oxf. Surv. Eukaryotic Genes. 1985; 2: 160-206PubMed Google Scholar) and is only reactivated in cases of renewed cellular proliferation, including liver regeneration and hepatocellular carcinoma (17Tilghman S.M. Oxf. Surv. Eukaryotic Genes. 1985; 2: 160-206PubMed Google Scholar, 18Nakabayashi H. Hashimoto T. Miyao Y. Tjong K.K. Chan J. Tamaoki T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5885-5893Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Differential AFP expression patterns are accompanied by discrete changes in local chromatin structure as measured by DNase I hypersensitivity (reviewed in Refs. 15Camper S.A. Godbout R. Tilghman S.M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1989; 36: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar and 19Godbout R. Ingram R. Tilghman S.M. Mol. Cell.

Tilghman S.M. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 949-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). AFP thus provides an excellent model to assay the potential contribution of chromatin structure to tissue-specific gene regulation. Previous studies using transient transfections and transgenic mice have identified multiple regulatory elements that control AFP expression. These include three distinct enhancers and a promoter/repressor region (19Godbout R. Ingram R. Tilghman S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 477-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 20Godbout R.

The enhancers were found to activate a heterologous promoter in non-hepatic cells, while a 1-kilobase fragment containing only the distal and proximal promoter regions exhibited absolute tissue specificity (19Godbout R. Ingram R. Tilghman S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 477-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The AFP promoter from −1 kb to the start site is therefore a major determinant of liver-specific transcription. Several liver-enriched proteins which direct hepatocyte-specific expression have been shown to bind multiple sites within the AFP promoter (reviewed in Ref. 24Cereghini S. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 267-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar), including CAAT/enhancer-binding protein (25Zhang D.-E. Hoyt P.R. Papaconstantinou J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3382-3391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 (HNF1; 26), and hepatocyte nuclear factor 3 (HNF3; 27). The HNF3 family is composed of three members, HNF3α, HNF3β, and HNF3γ, which, along with the Drosophila fork head protein, constitute a growing family of winged-helix DNA-binding proteins (28Lai E. Prezioso V.R. Tao W. Chen W.S. Darnell J.E.J. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 416-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). HNF3/fork head proteins that regulate gene expression in endoderm-derived tissues are required for pattern formation in the embryonic gut (see Ref. 29Dufort D. Schwartz L. Harpal K. Rossant J. Development. 1998; 125: 3015-3025Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, reviewed in Ref. 30Kaufmann E. Knochel W. Mech. Dev. 1996; 57: 3-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). HNF3α is of particular interest as it has been shown to position nucleosomes within the enhancer of the liver-specific albumin gene (31McPherson C.E. Eun-Yong S. Friedman D.S. Zaret K.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 387-398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar,32Shim E.Y. Woodcock C. Zaret K.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 5-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). A role for HNF3 in organizing chromatin is further supported by the three-dimensional structural similarity of the winged helix conformation to the globular domain of linker histones (33Clark K.L. Halay E.D. Lai E. Burley S.K. Nature. 1993; 364: 412-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar, 34Goytisolo F.A. Gerchman S.E., Yu, X. Rees C. Graziano V. Ramakrishnan V. Thomas J.O. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3421-3429Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar); functional conservation of this domain was confirmed by studies demonstrating the nucleosome-binding properties of HNF3 (35Cirillo L.A. McPherson C.E. Bossard P. Stevens K. Cherian S. Yon Shim E. Clark K.L. Burley S.K. Zaret K.S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 244-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which HNF3 transactivates hepatic-specific genes remains unclear. We show here that in vitro reconstitution of AFP expression patterns requires both activating and repressive influences. In order to model the tissue-specific expression of the AFP gene, we have used Xenopus laevis egg extracts as a source of histones and nucleosome assembly factors that can reconstitute physiologically spaced nucleosomes in vitro. Our results indicate that the general repressive nature of nucleosomal DNA is necessary to restrict transcription factor access in a non-hepatic environment. Transcription activation, within the context of chromatin, is achieved by binding of hepatic-enriched factors that mediate the restructuring of chromatin into a transcriptionally competent form. Furthermore, we find that HNF3α, in the absence of other hepatic-specific factors, is capable of activating AFP transcription both in vitro and in vivo, demonstrating a critical role for this fork head homolog in programming liver-specific expression patterns. The AFP(1.0)-lacZ vector was constructed by replacing the 177-bp Bam HI-Hin dIII fragment of (pA)3-APΔ44-lacZ (36Spear B.T. Longley T. Moulder S. Wang S.L. Peterson M.L. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 635-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) with a 1.0-kb Bam HI-Hin dIII fragment containing the AFP promoter/repressor region. The AFP(3.8)-lacZ vector was generated by inserting a 2.8-kb Bam HI fragment containing AFP enhancer element I into the Bam HI site of AFP(1.0)-lacZ. The HNF3α and HNF3β eukaryotic expression vector(s) were a kind gift from Dr. Robert Costa. The HNF3 empty vector was generated by removing the entire HNF3α cDNA insert from the HNF3α vector. The HNF3α bacterial expression vector was kindly provided by Dr. Kenneth Zaret. To obtain immobilized templates, AFP(1.0)-lacZ and AFP(3.8)-lacZ were digested with Eco RI and Cla I. The resulting fragments were Klenow end-filled with biotin 21-dUTP (CLONTECH) and biotin 14-dATP (Life Technologies, Inc.) to generate uniquely biotin-labeled Eco RI sites. Unincorporated nucleotides and small fragments were removed by gel filtration (Chromaspin 1000,CLONTECH). The largest 9.0-kb fragment encompassing the AFP enhancer I and promoter sequences were coupled to streptavidin-coated paramagnetic beads (Dynal) in Kilobase Binding Buffer (Dynal) on a rotating platform at room temperature overnight exactly as described by the manufacturer. Coupled beads were washed 3 times with 2 m NaCl, TE, pH 8.0, and stored in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C until use. HeLa and HepG2 cells were transfected with an AFP reporter construct (AFP(1.0)-lacZ) and either an HNF3 empty vector or an HNF3 expression vector along with a CAT control vector using the calcium phosphate protocol as described (36Spear B.T. Longley T. Moulder S. Wang S.L. Peterson M.L. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 635-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were harvested. β-Galactosidase assays were performed as described previously (36Spear B.T. Longley T. Moulder S. Wang S.L. Peterson M.L. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 635-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and normalized to CAT activity to control for variations in transfection. Hepatocarcinoma cell extracts were prepared from human HepG2 cells according to the method of Dignam et al. (37Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar) with the following minor modifications. Cells were grown to 70% confluence and harvested by scraping into phosphate-buffered saline. Washed pellets were resuspended in hypotonic buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol). After swelling 10 min on ice, cells were pelleted and resuspended in hypotonic buffer containing 0.05% Nonidet P-40 prior to Dounce homogenization (Wheaton, type B). Protein extracts were dialyzed against 2 changes of nuclear dialysis buffer (NDB: 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 2 h. each. Final protein concentration ranged from 7 to 12 μg/μl. HeLa nuclear extract was prepared exactly as described in Current Protocols in Molecular Biology (38Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R.

Final protein concentration ranged from 8 to 10 μg/μl.Xenopus egg chromatin assembly extracts were prepared exactly as described previously (39Barton M.C. Emerson B.M. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 274: 299-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Final protein concentrations ranged from 40 to 60 μg/μl. Recombinant HNF3α protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified exactly as described previously (40Zaret K.S. Stevens K. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 821-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Final protein concentration was approximately 150 ng/μl. Prior to nucleosome assembly, immobilized AFP templates were preincubated for 20 min at room temperature with the indicated extracts or NDB. Xenopus egg cytoplasmic fraction (HSS) in an amount previously determined to fully repress transcription was added to assemble the bead-DNA into chromatin for 1 h at 22 °C. Prior to transcription, the assembled templates were washed 3 times in NDB (unless otherwise indicated). Washed templates were then in vitro transcribed upon addition of an RNA polymerase II-containing nuclear HeLa extract (37Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar) and an NTP/salts/energy-generating mixture to give final concentrations of 0.6 mm CTP, UTP, GTP, ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm creatine phosphate, 10 units/ml of creatine kinase, 0.02% Nonidet P-40 (Sigma), and 12.6 mm HEPES, pH 7.9. After a 60-min incubation at 30 °C, RNA products were purified and analyzed by primer extension and gel electrophoresis (41Waterman M.L. Fischer W.H. Jones K.A. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 656-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Nucleosome assembly on the AFP/bead DNA was assessed by micrococcal nuclease (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) digestion after a 2-h incubation at 22 °C with fractionated Xenopus egg extract HSS containing 3 mm ATP and 5 mm MgCl2. Samples were digested and analyzed exactly as described previously (42Barton M.C. Madani N. Emerson B.M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1796-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). AFP bead/DNA was assembled into chromatin under conditions exactly as described for in vitro transcription analysis and then subjected to restriction enzyme digestion. Chromatin-assembled bead/DNA was washed once in 1 × React 2 restriction enzyme buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl; Life Technologies, Inc.) prior to resuspension in the same buffer containing Hin cII (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 25 units/μg of DNA. Following a 30-min incubation at 37 °C, samples were digested with 1 mg/ml proteinase K (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 0.25% SDS, 12.5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, for 1 h at 37 °C. For the Hin cII fragment release assay (Fig. 5 A), the purified DNA was resuspended in agarose gel loading dye and samples were analyzed by Southern blot as described previously (42Barton M.C. Madani N. Emerson B.M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1796-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A 23-bp probe (+5 to +28) was used to detect the 84-bp released fragment (−55 to +29). To measure accessibility at the distal Hin cII site (Fig. 5 B), the purified DNA was resuspended in 1 × React 1 restriction enzyme buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2; Life Technologies, Inc.) and digested to completion with 5 units of Acc I (Life Technologies, Inc.). Digested samples were analyzed by Southern blot using a 24-bp probe (+3333 to +3356) to detect a 4.0-kb Eco/Hin cII fragment. Autoradiograms were scanned and quantified using ImageQuaNT (Molecular Dynamics, version 4.2) software. For the Hin cII fragment release assay, activation over a buffer preincubated control was determined for three independent experiments and the average fold activation (± S.E.) was determined after normalizing to the buffer control. To determine the percent accessibility at the distal Hin cII site, we divided the intensity of the 4.0 kb released fragment by the sum of the 6.4-kb parent band and the released fragment. The fold activation was determined after normalizing to the buffer control. AFP bead/DNA was mock chromatin-assembled by preincubation with protein extracts in the presence or absence of recombinant HNF3α (750 ng) for 20 min prior to a 60-min incubation in egg extract buffer (100 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 100 mm sucrose, 0.1 mm EGTA) ± 3 mm ATP. Assembled bead/DNA was washed 3 times in NDB containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and then incubated in an NTP/salts/energy-generating mixture to give final concentrations of 0.6 mm CTP, UTP, GTP, ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm creatine phosphate, 10 units/ml of creatine kinase, 0.02% Nonidet P-40 (Sigma) and 12.6 mmHEPES, pH 7.9. After a 60-min incubation at 30 °C, RNA products were purified and analyzed by primer extension and gel electrophoresis (41Waterman M.L. Fischer W.H. Jones K.A. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 656-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). To explore the basis for tissue-specific AFP regulation, we have employed an in vitro transcription system for AFP. The well characterized human hepatoma cell line HepG2 (43Aden D.P. Fogel A. Plotkin S. Damjanov I. Knowles B.B. Nature. 1979; 282: 615-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar) was used as a source of AFP trans-activating factors. Human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells were chosen as a source of non-liver transcription factors. HepG2 cells actively express both endogenous and transiently introduced AFP, whereas HeLa cells do not (19Godbout R. Ingram R. Tilghman S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 477-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To establish an in vitro chromatin transcription assay for the AFP gene, we have attached AFP DNA to streptavidin-coated paramagnetic beads. This system, based on a design for transcriptional analysis of the Drosophila hsp70 promoter (44Sandaltzopoulos R. Blank T. Becker P.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), facilitates the rapid purification and concentration of chromatin-assembled templates. A plasmid containing 3.8 kb of mouse AFP regulatory sequence (AFP(3.8)-lacZ), including enhancer I and the distal and proximal promoter elements (36Spear B.T. Longley T. Moulder S. Wang S.L. Peterson M.L. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 635-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), was restriction enzyme-digested, biotin-end labeled and coupled to streptavidin-coated magnetic beads. The immobilized DNA (AFP/bead DNA) was then transcribed under standard in vitro transcription conditions with either HeLa or HepG2 extract (Fig. 1). Nucleosome-free AFP/bead DNA is efficiently transcribed by both extracts, with peak transcription occurring in the presence of 15 μl of extract, each containing approximately 150 μg of total protein (lanes 3 and 6). These results indicate that restrictions required to direct tissue-specific expression of AFP in vivo cannot be recapitulated on free DNA. To recreate in vitro the physiological constraints conferred by chromatin in vivo, AFP/bead DNA was subjected to nucleosome assembly. Chromatin assembly was achieved by incubation with fractionated Xenopus egg extract. The cytoplasmic fraction or high speed supernatant (HSS) of Xenopus eggs efficiently assembles physiologically spaced nucleosomes (45Rhodes D. Laskey R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 170: 575-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and has been used in previous chromatin transcription studies (42Barton M.C. Madani N. Emerson B.M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1796-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 46Barton M.C. Emerson B.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2453-2465Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Efficiency of chromatin assembly was assessed by micrococcal nuclease digestion. A time course of digestion with micrococcal nuclease indicated the formation of a repetitive array of nucleosomes on the bead/DNA (Fig.2 A). This pattern is identical to that observed on uncoupled AFP DNA incubated in Xenopus HSS (data not shown). We further assessed the extent of chromatin assembly by measuring transcription levels. Assembly of AFP/bead DNA into nucleosomes in the presence of HSS resulted in repression of AFP transcription (Fig. 2 B, compare lanes 1 and 2). This transcriptional repression was maintained during washes in a low salt (50 mm KCl) buffer. However, repression was alleviated by washing the chromatin-assembled bead/DNA in a high salt (3 m KCl) wash buffer (lane 3). As 3 m KCl is a sufficiently high salt concentration to disrupt histone/histone and histone/DNA interactions, these data suggest that the repression of AFP transcription observed in lane 2 is mediated by nucleosome assembly. Together, these results indicate that AFP/bead DNA is efficiently assembled into nucleosomal DNA in the presence of Xenopus egg extract. As shown above (Fig. 1), HepG2 and HeLa extracts transcribe naked AFP DNA templates in vitro with equal efficiencies. To determine whether these transcriptionally competent extracts were capable of establishing active transcription on a chromatin-assembled template, AFP/bead DNA was incubated with increasing amounts of either HeLa or HepG2 extracts or in nuclear extract buffer alone prior to chromatin assembly (Fig.3). This “programming” phase allows transactivators and repressors to bind their respective sites on the nucleosome-free template prior to reconstitution into chromatin. Nucleosome-assembled templates, programmed in this way, were washed in low salt buffer prior to transcription to remove any unassociated proteins and nonspecific transcription repressors; this washing step further ensures that only DNA-associated proteins and protein complexes are present during the in vitro transcription analysis. Chromatin-mediated repression could not be alleviated by providing HeLa factors prior to nucleosome assembly (Fig. 3 A, compare lanes 1 and 2–4). Thus, general transcription factors and non-hepatic transactivators provided by the HeLa extract are insufficient to mediate assembly of a chromatin template which supports transcription. In contrast, incubating AFP/bead DNA with HepG2 extract during the programming stage, prior to nucleosome assembly, resulted in transcriptionally active templates (lanes 5–7). Comparison with a nucleosome-free AFP template control transcription (data not shown) revealed that the HepG2 preincubation rescued 90% (±3.9% S.E.) of free DNA transcription levels, indicating almost complete derepression of the chromatin template. An equivalent level of derepression was obtained when hepatoma factors were introduced concomitant with egg extract addition (Fig. 3 B, compare lanes 2 and 4, 7 and 9). Hepatoma factors can, therefore, successfully compete with histones to bind their respective sites during on-going chromatin assembly and maturation. Addition of a low salt wash step immediately after pre-binding of the hepatoma extract did not significantly alter hepatoma-mediated assembly into an active chromatin template, indicating the stability of the protein/DNA interactions (data not shown). To confirm that preincubation with cellular extract under transcription conditions did not disrupt nucleosome assembly, chromatin templates preincubated with buffer, HepG2, or HeLa extract were subjected to a limit digest with micrococcal nuclease (Fig.3 C). Southern analysis of the digested DNA was performed using either a transcriptional start site oligo (+5 to +28) or the full-length AFP(3.8)-lacZ plasmid as a probe. Equivalent amounts of mononucleosomes were observed under all three transcription conditions, indicating that HepG2-mediated transcription activation was not due to gross inhibition of nucleosome assembly. Nucleosome-free AFP templates which lack the enhancer element but retain 1.0 kb of upstream regulatory sequence (AFP(1.0)-lacZ), are transcribed as efficiently as the full-length enhancer-containing construct (AFP(3.8)-lacZ) in in vitro transcription assays with nuclear HeLa extract (data not shown). Transcription analysis of chromatin-assembled templates indicates that the enhancer is not required to establish hepatoma-activated AFP expression in vitro (Fig. 3 B, lanes 6–9). These results indicate that 1.0 kb of AFP upstream regulatory sequence is sufficient to confer liver-specific expression, consistent with previous transfection studies by Tilghman and colleagues (19Godbout R. Ingram R. Tilghman S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 477-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). These data demonstrate that HepG2 extract contains factors which are capable of stably associating with AFP regulatory sequences and directing the assembly of an accessible chromatin structure. HeLa extract is unable to program transcriptionally competent nucleosome-assembled DNA, indicating either a lack of essential activators or the presence of repressors which only function within the context of chromatin. Thus, our in vitro chromatin transcription assay system successfully recapitulates the restricted AFP expression pattern observed in vivo, indicating the importance of chromatin structure for tissue-specific regulation of AFP. These results along with the robust transcription of nucleosome-free AFP DNA observed in HeLa extract (Fig. 1), suggest that hepatic-specific factors may enhance the formation of functional preinitiation complexes on the nucleosome-assembled AFP template. One likely candidate for such an hepatic-enriched factor is the winged helix protein, HNF3, which regulates the transcription of numerous liver-specific genes including albumin, transthyretin, and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (reviewed in Refs. 30Kaufmann E.

A core set of subunits, consisting of a ketosynthase, a chain length factor, an acyl carrier protein (ACP) and possibly a malonyl CoA:ACP transacylase (MAT) forms a “minimal” PKS.

Here we (a) report on the kinetic properties of the actinorhodin minimal PKS, and (b) present further data in support of the requirement of the MAT. Kinetic analysis showed that the apoACP is a competitive inhibitor of minimal PKS activity, demonstrating the importance of protein-protein interactions between the polypeptide moiety of the ACP and the remainder of the minimal PKS. In further support of the requirement of MAT for PKS activity, two new findings are presented. First, we observe hyperbolic dependence of PKS activity on MAT concentration, saturating at very low amounts (half-maximal rate at 19.7 ± 5.1 nm). Since MAT can support PKS activity at less than 1/100 the typical concentration of the ACP and ketosynthase/chain length factor components, it is difficult to rule out the presence of trace quantities of MAT in a PKS reaction mixture. Second, an S97A mutant was constructed at the nucleophilic active site of the MAT. Not only can this mutant protein support PKS activity, it is also covalently labeled by [14C]malonyl-CoA, demonstrating that the serine nucleophile (which has been the target of PMSF inhibition in earlier studies) is dispensible for MAT activity in a Type II PKS system.

They include many macrocyclic and aromatic compounds such as tetracyclines and erythromycin (antibiotics), FK506 (immunosuppressant), doxorubicin (anticancer), and avermectin (antiparasite). The aforementioned are all from actinomycetes, a bacterial group that synthesizes a large proportion of such compounds. Gene clusters of several bacterial and fungal polyketide pathways have been cloned and analyzed. Sequence analysis has revealed that polyketide synthases (PKSs)1 are multifunctional enzymes that are structurally and mechanistically related to fatty acid synthases. Through a catalytic process involving repeated decarboxylative condensations between coenzyme A-derived acylthioesters, they synthesize a growing carbon chain backbone that is regio- and stereoselectively modified into the final natural product. PKSs achieve enormous structural variety by controlling the overall chain length, choosing primer and extender units (usually acetyl, propionyl, malonyl, and methylmalonyl) and, especially in the case of aromatic polyketides, guiding the regiospecific cyclizations of growing chains (for reviews, see Refs. 1Carreras C.W. Pieper R. Khosla C. Top. Curr. Chem. 1997; 188: 85-126Crossref Google Scholar, 2Hutchinson R.C. Fuji I. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1995; 49: 201-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 3Katz L.

Type II PKSs are a family of bacterial PKSs related to Type II fatty acid synthases found in bacteria and plants. They catalyze the biosynthesis of a broad range of polyfunctional aromatic natural products. These PKSs contain a single set of iteratively used active sites carried on separate proteins. They consist of a “minimal” PKS and auxiliary subunits. The minimal PKS is composed of four subunits: a ketosynthase (KS), a chain length factor (CLF), an acyl carrier protein (ACP), and possibly a malonyl CoA:ACP transacylase (MAT) (5Carreras C.W. Khosla C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2084-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 6Bao W. Wendt-Pienkowski E. Hutchinson C.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8132-8138Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To be active the ACP needs a phosphopantetheine arm where acyl chains are attached during the course of polyketide synthesis. Since apoACP, which lacks this prosthetic group, fails to support polyketide synthesis, the role of the pantetheine arm in catalysis has been well established. In contrast, the role (if any) of the polypeptide moiety of the ACP is less clear. Indeed, in certain polyketide synthases and non-ribosomal peptide synthetases, the requirement of an acyl carrier protein can be by-passed by presenting the condensing enzyme with appropriate CoA- or CoA-mimetic substrates (7Jacobsen J.R. Hutchinson C.R. Cane D.E. Khosla C. Science. 1997; 277: 367-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). A model has been proposed for the sequence of reactions in aromatic polyketide biosynthesis by the minimal PKS (Fig.1). Malonyl units are transferred from malonyl CoA to the ACP by the MAT. Repeated decarboxylative condensations occur between the ACP-bound nucleophilic extender units and the KS-bound electrophilic growing chains, giving rise to a poly-β-ketone backbone of a specified length (5Carreras C.W. Khosla C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2084-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). (The system is primed by a decarboxylated malonyl unit by a mechanism that remains to be elucidated, but presumably involves the decarboxylative activity of the KS (8Carreras C.W. Pieper R. Khosla C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 5158-5159Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar).) In the case of the actinorhodin (act) minimal PKS, a 16-carbon backbone is generated, which subsequently undergoes cyclization to generate two principal products, SEK4 and SEK4b (Fig.1). There is some debate about the requirement of the MAT for minimal PKS activity. Since no MAT or homologous protein is encoded within typical aromatic PKS gene clusters, it was originally suggested that these aromatic PKSs utilized the MAT from primary fatty acid metabolism (9Revill P.R. Bibb M.J. Hopwood D.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3946-3952Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar,10Summers R.G. Ali A. Shen B. Wessel W.A. Hutchinson C.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9389-9404Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). As a direct test of this idea, we attempted to reconstitute the act minimal PKS from purified components (5Carreras C.W. Khosla C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2084-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In our laboratory purified KS-CLF (which co-elute as a tight complex) and ACP were found to be insufficient for reconstituting PKS activity comparable to that seen in crude cell-free extracts of Streptomyces coelicolor, which produces actinorhodin. However, when crude extracts from CH999, an engineered strain of S. coelicolor that lacks the entire act gene cluster, were added to purified KS-CLF and ACP, PKS activity was observed. Based on this assay, we purified a 32-kDa protein from CH999 that was responsible for this activity. N-terminal sequencing revealed that it was identical to the MAT involved in fatty acid biosynthesis in S. coelicolor. Based on this and earlier in vivo results (9Revill P.R. Bibb M.J. Hopwood D.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3946-3952Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 10Summers R.G. Ali A. Shen B. Wessel W.A. Hutchinson C.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9389-9404Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), we proposed that the fatty acid MAT is also a component of the act minimal PKS. A similar conclusion was also reached by Hutchinson and co-workers (6Bao W. Wendt-Pienkowski E. Hutchinson C.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8132-8138Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) who determined that >90% of the malonyl-CoA incorporated into TCM F2 was derived from a MAT-catalyzed pathway. However, two recent communications from Simpson and co-workers (11Hitchman T.S. Crosby J. Byrom K.J. Cox R.J. Simpson T.J. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: 35-47Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 12Matharu A.-L. Cox R. Crosby J. Byrom K.J. Simpson T.J. Chem. Biol. (Lond.). 1998; 5: 699-711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) have challenged the validity of these results. Hitchman, et al. (11Hitchman T.S. Crosby J. Byrom K.J. Cox R.J. Simpson T.J. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: 35-47Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) showed that: (i) in contrast to the Escherichia coli ACP (obtained from a commercial source and purified) wild-type and mutant forms of the act ACP is capable of transferring malonyl groups from malonyl-CoA in the absence of MAT; (ii) that this self-malonylation reaction has a kcat of 0.34 min−1 and a Km of 219 μm; and (iii) that this reaction is not inhibited by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, a known inhibitor of the E. coli MAT. These results led them to speculate that an MAT is not required for PKS activity, and that the KS, CLF, and ACP may constitute a truly minimal PKS in vivo. Subsequently, Matharu et al. (12Matharu A.-L. Cox R. Crosby J. Byrom K.J. Simpson T.J. Chem. Biol. (Lond.). 1998; 5: 699-711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) presented additional data in support of this model. They showed that: (i) their ACP and KS/CLF preparations, which contain low (but non-zero) MAT activity, were necessary and sufficient for PKS activity, and (ii) the marginal advantage of the S. coelicolor MAT on the rate of polyketide synthesis is only detectable up to a concentration of 20 μm ACP. Thus, the exact composition of the minimal PKS remains unresolved. This report describes the steady-state kinetic properties of the act minimal PKS. The dependence of the rate of polyketide synthesis on the concentration of individual protein components is assessed. Likewise, the ability of the apoACP to inhibit minimal PKS activity is evaluated. Finally, an S97A mutant of the S. coelicolor MAT, which lacks the nucleophile on which malonyl groups are believed to be transiently attached, has been constructed and analyzed. Our results provide direct evidence for interactions between the polypeptide portion of the ACP and the remainder of the minimal PKS components. Moreover, they also shed further light on whether physiologically relevant minimal PKS activity requires the MAT or not.

Fractions containing the act holoACP were collected at the beginning of the (NH4)2SO4 gradient from phenyl-Sepharose columns (as described for KS/CLF). Further purification of the ACP was achieved with a Resource Q (Pharmacia) column using a gradient from buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 6, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 15% glycerol) to buffer B (A + 1 m NaCl). The ACP eluted between 240 and 300 mm NaCl. Gel filtration on a Superdex-200 column in 100 mm NaHPO4, pH 7.3, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol was performed as the final purification step.

The following primers were designed with Nde I and Eco RI sites at the 5′ and 3′ termini, respectively: ATATACATATGCTCGTACTCGTCGC and ATCCGAATTCGGCCTGGGTGTGCTCGGC. The stop codon was deleted. S. coelicolor genomic DNA was used as a template for polymerase chain reaction. The polymerase chain reaction fragment was cloned into pET21c vector in the Nde I-Eco RI restriction sites to result in pANS512. The expressed protein had a 6xHis tag at the C-terminal end for simpler purification. E. coli BL21(DE3) cells were transformed with pANS512, containing the cloned S. coelicolor MAT gene. 1-Liter cultures were induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at A595 = 0.6–0.8. Cells were harvested 3 h after induction. The cell pellet was resuspended in 50 mmTris, pH 8.4, and lysed by sonication on ice. Cell debris was pelleted at 11,000 rpm, 4 °C and the supernatant was loaded onto a nickel NTA-agarose column (Qiagen). MAT elutes at 50 mm imidazole, pH 8.0. Protein was obtained at yields of ∼1 mg/liter and was judged to be >95% pure by SDS-PAGE. The MAT was concentrated after purification and buffer was changed to 100 mmNaHPO4, pH 7.3, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mmdithiothreitol. All protein concentrations were determined by Lowry assays (18Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using a kit from Sigma diagnostics. Production of SEK4 and SEK4b was monitored in vitro by an assay based on14C-labeled malonyl-CoA incorporation. 100-μl reactions in 100 mm NaHPO4, pH 7.3, 2 mmEDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol were started by adding [14C]malonyl-CoA (23.654 mm, 0.705 mCi/mmol) to a final concentration of 2.4 mm and stopped by addition of solid NaH2PO4. Reaction products were visualized by thin layer chromatography (TLC) as described in Ref.5Carreras C.W. Khosla C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2084-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar. Products were quantified by counting radioactivity using an InstantImager 2024 (Packard). MAT S97A was constructed using pANS512 as template for a T7 DNA polymerase-based double-stranded, site-directed mutagenesis method (Chameleon, Stratagene). The mutant clone used for enzyme preparation was verified by DNA sequencing. 21-μl Reaction mixtures of 25 pmol of MAT and 14C-labeled malonyl-CoA (75 nCi, 52 mCi/mmol) were incubated for 15 min, stopped by addition of 5 μl of acidic gel loading buffer (0.1% bromphenol blue, 1% SDS, 40% glycerol, 5% trichloroacetic acid), and analyzed by autoradiography of a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (5Carreras C.W. Khosla C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2084-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Polyketides produced in vitro can be radiolabeled using [14C]malonyl-CoA as substrate. SEK4 and SEK4b, synthesized by the act minimal PKS, are visualized and quantities determined by TLC autoradiography. Polyketide production in 100-μl reactions containing 20 μm act holoACP, 100 nm MAT, and 0.8 μm KS/CLF is linear over about 30 min; during this period the PKS turns over approximately 12 times. We measured SEK4 and SEK4b production within this range to determine initial reaction velocities for different conditions. In a series of reactions, initial velocities of SEK4 + SEK4b production were measured as a function of malonyl-CoA concentration. The apparent Km for malonyl-CoA was found to be 79.1 ± 8.2 μm (data not shown). To keep the substrate concentration at saturating levels, all reactions described below were performed at 2.4 mmmalonyl-CoA concentrations. The core component of the act minimal PKS is formed by the KS and CLF. These two proteins form a tight complex. One pair of KS and CLF is expected to contain one active site for the condensation of acylthioesters. Therefore, concentrations of KS and CLF were calculated assuming an αβ type complex representing 1 catalytic unit even though these two proteins purify as an α2β2 heterotetramer (5Carreras C.W. Khosla C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2084-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). KS/CLF was titrated into reaction mixtures containing a fixed act holoACP concentration of 20 μm and a fixed MAT concentration of 100 nm. (These concentrations of both MAT and ACP are sufficient to saturate the system, as described below.) Initial reaction velocities were measured up to 1.6 μmKS/CLF, an upper limit dictated by the concentrations of the different protein preparations. When initial reaction velocities were plotted against KS/CLF concentration, a linear relationship was observed (Fig. 2). From the slope of this line, an apparent kcat of 0.31 ± 0.11 min−1 was deduced (average based on three independent experiments). The MAT was titrated into a reaction mixture containing 0.8 μm act KS/CLF and 20 μm act holoACP (Fig.3). Several features should be noted. First, within the limits of TLC autoradiography based detection, no PKS activity could be observed in the absence of MAT. Second, MAT is required in only small amounts to allow maximal activity of the system. In an effort to quantify the ability of MAT to saturate the system, we determined the concentration of MAT at which 50% of the maximum velocity was reached. This concentration is found to be 19.7 ± 5.1 nm (average based on two independent experiments). Third, fitting a hyperbolic curve to the data shown in Fig. 3 yielded an apparent Vmax of 33.2 ± 2.1 pmol/min. Taking KS/CLF as the enzyme in the reaction, an apparent kcat of 0.41 ± 0.03 min−1 is calculated, which is in good agreement with the apparent kcat measured in the KS-CLF titrations described above. Fren holoACP was added in increasing amounts to reaction mixtures containing 0.8 μm KS/CLF and 100 nm MAT. The rate of SEK4 and SEK4b production depends on fren holoACP concentration as shown in Fig. 4 A. At about 10 μm fren holoACP a maximum velocity is reached. A hyperbolic curve fitted to the data measured shows a Vmax of 34.7 ± 1.7 pmol/min. Half-maximal velocity is reached at 2.1 ± 0.55 μm. The same experiment as with fren ACP was performed with wild-type act holoACP. As shown in Fig. 5, the dependence of the rate of polyketide synthesis on the concentration of act holoACP is complex; it peaks at a concentration of 20 μm and drops thereafter. This profile was reproducibly observed in three separate experiments conducted with independent protein preparations. The reaction velocity at 20 μm ACP is 34 pmol/min, corresponding to an apparent kcat of 0.43 min−1, which compares well with the numbers obtained in MAT and KS/CLF titrations. Not accounting for the inhibitory effects that are observed beyond 20 μm (see “Discussion”), a half-saturating concentration for ACP can be estimated to be approximately 5 μm (average based on three independent experiments). Fren holoACP titrations were performed as described above (0.8 μm KS/CLF, 100 nm MAT). In these experiments the fren apoACP was present in the reaction at a fixed concentration. Interestingly, we observe a clear inhibition of SEK4 and SEK4b production in the presence of the catalytically inactive apoACP. The extent of inhibition depends on apoACP concentration. Thus, we determined the effect of apoACP by calculation of Kivalues for competitive and noncompetitive inhibition. For the competitive component a Ki of 12.3 μmis deduced (Fig. 4 B). As the noncompetitive part leads to a very high Ki (> 300 μm), no significant noncompetitive competition is measured. To confirm that fren apoACP also inhibits activity of the PKS in the presence of the act holoACP, the experiment was repeated by varying the concentration of the act holoACP in the presence of 6 μm fren apoACP. Again, significant inhibition by apoACP was observed in this case (Fig. 5); however, given the unusual features of the titration curve for the act holoACP in the absence of apoACP, quantitative measurements of inhibitory constants were not made. Extensive analysis of acyltransferases from various fatty acid or polyketide synthases has shown that a serine residue corresponding to Ser-97 of the S. coelicolor MAT is the active site nucleophile of this enzyme. Malonyl groups are transiently attached to this residue during their transfer from malonyl-CoA to the ACP via a ping-pong kinetic scheme (19Joshi V.C. Wakil S.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1971; 143: 493-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). More recently, the x-ray crystal structure of the E. coli MAT (40% identical to the S. coelicolor MAT at the amino acid level) has confirmed assignment of Ser-97 as the active site of this family of enzymes. We sought to construct and analyze a mutant MAT in which this nucleophile is eliminated. The mutant protein was generated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Unexpectedly, it was found to be both necessary and sufficient for polyketide biosynthesis (Fig.6 A). Moreover, consistent with the expectation that the MAT must function via a ping-pong mechanism, incubation of the protein with [14C]malonyl-CoA and analysis by SDS-PAGE-autoradiography showed that malonyl groups could be covalently attached to the protein (Fig. 6 B). These results suggest that the MAT from S. coelicolor possesses an alternative nucleophilic group that is capable of substituting for the active site serine in the S97A mutant.

Nature. 1995; 375: 549-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), their mechanisms and relationships with Type II fatty acid synthases have been of considerable interest. Initial efforts toward these goals relied on metabolic characterization of genetically manipulated PKSs. More recently, cell-free systems have been developed to study polyketide synthesis in vitro (5Carreras C.W. Khosla C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2084-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 6Bao W. Wendt-Pienkowski E. Hutchinson C.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8132-8138Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar,8Carreras C.W. Pieper R. Khosla C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 5158-5159Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The actinorhodin (act) PKS from S. coelicolor has been an excellent model system for both in vivo and in vitro studies. Here we have quantified the steady-state kinetic properties of this minimal PKS. In particular, titrations of the individual components of the minimal PKS have yielded interesting insights into the properties of Type II PKSs. At saturating concentrations of ACP and MAT, the dependence of initial reaction velocity on KS/CLF concentration is apparently linear up to a KS/CLF concentration of 1.6 μm(Fig. 2). The reaction rate could be expected to saturate at higher KS/CLF concentrations; however, practical limitations prevented the direct observation of this saturation. An apparent kcat of 0.31 min−1 was derived from these measurements, which is in good agreement with an apparent kcat of 0.41 min−1, derived from MAT titrations (Fig. 3), as well as with recently reported measurements in the range of 1 min−1 (12Matharu A.-L. Cox R. Crosby J. Byrom K.J. Simpson T.J. Chem. Biol. (Lond.). 1998; 5: 699-711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Similar titration analysis was also performed for the act ACP (Fig. 5). At 100 nm MAT and 0.8 μmKS/CLF, the reaction rate increased with increasing amounts of ACP up to a concentration of 20 μm, and decreased thereafter. The reason for this inhibition is unclear, and may perhaps reflect the ability of the wild-type act ACP to dimerize at high concentrations (12Matharu A.-L. Cox R. Crosby J. Byrom K.J. Simpson T.J. Chem. Biol. (Lond.). 1998; 5: 699-711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, because of the inhibition observed at high ACP concentrations, all other measurements in this study involving the act holoACP were made at a holoACP concentration of 20 μm. The fren ACP saturates the multicomponent system at slightly lower concentrations than act ACP (Fig.4). Inhibition is not observed at higher fren ACP concentrations. The observation that ACP is needed in substantially more than stoichiometric amounts compared with the KS/CLF for maximal activity is consistent with earlier genetic studies where alterations in expression levels of the ACP gene resulted in significant differences in polyketide production in vivo (28Khosla C. McDaniel R. Ebert-Khosla S. Torres R. Sherman D.H. Bibb M.J. Hopwood D.A. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2197-2204Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It suggests that the ACP interacts only loosely with the PKS core comprised of the KS and CLF. However, ACP titrations alone do not allow discrimination between two alternative models for Type II PKS activity, a “static” model in which one ACP molecule interacts with a given KS/CLF pair to chaperone the synthesis of a complete octaketide chain, versus a “dynamic” model in which KS/CLF and ACP proteins can interchange during the overall catalytic cycle. More detailed kinetic studies should be illuminating in this regard. Three results described here shed new light on the debate over whether the MAT is required for minimal PKS activity or not. First, although the kcat reported here for the (MAT-containing)act PKS is similar to the kcatmeasured for the self-malonation reaction of the act ACP (0.34 min−1) (11Hitchman T.S. Crosby J. Byrom K.J. Cox R.J. Simpson T.J. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: 35-47Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), the Km values for malonyl-CoA in the two reactions are different. Whereas the overall Km for the (MAT-containing) act PKS is 79 μm, the Km for the self-malonation reaction is 216 μm. Since intracellular malonyl-CoA concentrations are relatively low, this difference supports the notion that the MAT-dependent pathway dominates over the MAT-independent one in vivo. Second, a crucial titration reported here is that of the MAT component into the PKS reaction mixture (Fig. 3). In this context it is important to note that we do not detect any PKS activity in the absence of the MAT at a KS/CLF concentration of 0.8 μm and an act or fren holoACP concentration of 20 μm (Fig. 3). (Under these conditions, our assays can reliably detect PKS activity that is as little as about 5% of the maximum reaction velocity.) This is consistent with our earlier observations (5Carreras C.W. Khosla C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2084-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), as well as those of Hutchinson and co-workers (6Bao W. Wendt-Pienkowski E. Hutchinson C.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8132-8138Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) made with the tetracenomycin PKS, but contradicts the observations of Simpson and co-workers (12Matharu A.-L. Cox R. Crosby J. Byrom K.J. Simpson T.J. Chem. Biol. (Lond.). 1998; 5: 699-711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). More importantly, unlike KS/CLF and ACP, MAT is required in very small amounts for maximal PKS activity. Vmax/2 is reached at a MAT concentration of 19.7 nm and suggests a very fast or tight interaction with the other PKS components. The role of the MAT is to acylate the ACP with malonyl units derived from malonyl-CoA. Low MAT concentrations required to saturate the minimal PKS most probably result from highly efficient acylation of the ACP by the MAT, followed by a slower condensation reaction between the KS- and ACP-bound substrates. Work on fatty acid synthesis where turnover rates as high as 1.6 × 103 s−1, were measured for the MAT, support this view (19Joshi V.C. Wakil S.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1971; 143: 493-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Finally, our studies on the S97A mutant of the S. coelicolor MAT demonstrate that, even when the catalytic potency of the MAT is drastically attenuated by removal of the active site nucleophile, MAT can support PKS activity, perhaps through the recruitment of an alternative covalent attachment site for malonyl extender units. Based on these results, we propose that MAT is an important component of the minimal PKS in vivo. A definitive test of this matter would involve the construction and analysis of a knock-out of the MAT gene in S. coelicolor; however, since MAT is also required for fatty acid biosynthesis in the cell, this is a challenging task. Perhaps most interestingly, titration of holoACP in the presence of an apoACP revealed that apoACP has a substantial inhibitory effect on SEK4 and SEK4b production (Figs. 4 and 5). In vivo studies in E. coli have recently shown that overexpression of apoACP inhibits growth, although no direct molecular explanation can be derived from these studies (29Keating D.H. Zhang Y. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2662-2667Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, it is known that E. coli maintains its apoACP concentration at a very low level, perhaps because of its inhibitory effect (30Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 15186-15191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since apoACP lacks a pantetheine arm and is catalytically inactive, our results provide direct evidence for functionally relevant interactions between the peptidic portion of a Type II ACP and the remainder of the PKS. A mainly competitive type of inhibition was deduced because apoACP clearly affects saturation and Vmax only to a lesser extent. Importantly, inhibition is observed with both act and fren holoACP, ruling out a fren- specific phenomenon. It is unclear whether this inhibition reflects interactions between the apoACP protein and MAT or KS/CLF or both. Since the solution structures of several Type II ACPs have been solved (31Holak T.A.

Thus, ASGPR binding of TG at the apical membrane is hypothesized to bind more recently synthesized, poorly iodinated, and poorly sialylated TG, sequestering it, and making it unavailable for fluid pinocytosis. As a result, highly iodinated and sialylated TG molecules, which are free in the follicular lumen, preferentially undergo fluid pinocytosis (22Consiglio E. Salvatore G. Rall J.E. Kohn L.D. J. Biol.

Acquaviva A.M. Catanzano A.M.M. Tassi V. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3179-3185Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), not only eliminates the ability of TG to be a transcriptional suppressor of thyroid-restricted genes, it also allows the TG to act as an enhancer of their expression. Treatment of cells with an inhibitor of serine/threonine phosphatase activity, okadaic acid, also eliminates TG suppression. We suggest that follicular TG acts as a regulator of thyroid-restricted gene expression by binding to the ASGPR on the apical thyrocyte membrane and that phosphorylation of TG regulates the suppressive effect. The data are the first to describe a role for the ASGPR in transcriptional signaling and a biologic role for phosphorylated TG, particularly its phosphoserine residues.DISCUSSIONThe thyroid follicle is the functional unit of the thyroid gland (1Kohn L.D.

Thyroid cells secrete and store TG into its lumen; they also concentrate and secrete iodide into the follicular lumen, where TPO and H2O2 iodinate the TG tyrosine residues and contribute to iodotyrosine coupling to form thyroid hormones.

The fundamental question that arose from this new paradigm is how the TG molecule stored in the follicular lumen, could regulate the transcriptional machinery of the cell.In the present report, we show that binding of TG to the ASGPR on the apical membrane of the thyrocyte, the membrane facing the follicular lumen, is the initial event in the TG suppression process in thyrocytes. We show that 27 S TG binds to thyroid cells better than 19 S or 12 S TG and that this parallels the suppressive action of the follicular TG moieties, 27 S > 19 S > 12 S. We show that a specific antibody to the RHL-1 subunit of the thyroid ASGPR2 blocks TG-induced suppression.

In B cells, HEF1 is phosphorylated by a cytoskeleton-dependent mechanism that is triggered by integrin ligation. However, the induction of HEF1 phosphorylation by G protein-coupled receptors has not been reported. We found that HEF1, but not p130Cas, is tyrosine-phosphorylated following stimulation of the rabbit C1a calcitonin receptor stably expressed in HEK-293 cells. The calcitonin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of HEF1 increased in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Dibutyryl cAMP and forskolin had little or no effect on HEF1 phosphorylation, and the protein kinase A inhibitor H89 failed to detectably inhibit the response to calcitonin, indicating that the Gs/cAMP/protein kinase A pathway does not mediate the calcitonin effect. Pertussis toxin, which selectively blocks Gi/o signaling, also had no effect. Increasing cytosolic Ca2+ with ionomycin stimulated HEF1 phosphorylation and preventing any calcitonin-induced change in cytosolic calcium by a combination of BAPTA and extracellular EGTA completely blocked the calcitonin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of HEF1. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate also induced HEF1 tyrosine phosphorylation, and the protein kinase C inhibitor calphostin C completely inhibited both calcitonin- and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-stimulated HEF1 phosphorylation. Calcitonin also induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin and focal adhesion kinase, and the association of these two proteins with HEF1. Pretreatment with cytochalasin D, which disrupts actin microfilaments, prevented the calcitonin-induced HEF1 and paxillin phosphorylation. In conclusion, the calcitonin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of HEF1 is mediated by calcium- and protein kinase C-dependent mechanisms and requires the integrity of the actin cytoskeleton.

Chem. 1996; 271: 31127-31134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), also endogenously expresses both p130Casand HEF1, we sought to determine whether activating the CTR could induce phosphorylation of either p130Cas or HEF1 and, if so, to characterize the signaling pathways that couple the receptor to the downstream events. Interestingly, CT stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of HEF1 in a time- and dose-dependent manner, whereas no significant tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas was detected. The HEF1 phosphorylation was dependent on increased [Ca2+]i and the activation of PKC, and it was inhibited by cytochalasin D, suggesting the involvement of the actin cytoskeleton. We further showed that CT also induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin and FAK, and the association of these two proteins with HEF1.

Cells were changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.5% fetal bovine serum for 18 h prior to the treatments. After treatment as described under “Results,” cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 1% IGEPAL CA-630, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm iodoacetamide, 10 mm NaF, 0.4 mmNa2VO4, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. Insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min. Protein concentrations were assayed with the Bradford protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad). The lysates were incubated with antibodies overnight with mild agitation, and then 50 μl of a 50% slurry of protein G-agarose (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added, and the samples were agitated for another 1 h. Immune complexes were washed three times with ice-cold lysis buffer. The immune complexes or 30 μg of total cell lysates were then subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (8% gels). The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In the experiments where membranes were reprobed for a second antigen, the membranes were first stripped in 62.5 mm Tris, 2% SDS, 0.7% β-mercaptoethanol, pH 6.7, at 52 °C for 30 min with slight shaking. We initially investigated whether treating C1a-HEK cells with CT would induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas and/or HEF1. Treatment of the cells for 3 min with 1 nm CT induced an increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins of approximate molecular mass = 100–140, 93, 60–70, and 30 kDa (Fig. 1, TCL lanes). The heavily phosphorylated band at 105–110 kDa was immunoprecipitated by anti-HEF1 number 1 and by anti-C/H, an antibody that recognizes both p130Cas and HEF1 (Fig.1 A). Stripping the membrane and reprobing with anti-C/H revealed two bands, at 105 kDa and 130 kDa, in the lysates and C/H immunoprecipitates and a single 105-kDa band in the HEF1 number 1 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1 B). The 105-kDa bands in the C/H blot corresponded to the 105-kDa band in the anti-P-Tyr blot, indicating that this tyrosine phosphorylated band was HEF1. Similar results were obtained when the immunoprecipitation and immunoblot were performed with anti-HEF1 number 2 (data not shown). Although the anti-C/H antibody immunoprecipitated both p130Cas and HEF1, only HEF1 was detectably tyrosine phosphorylated (Fig.1, compare A and B). Finally, to confirm that the tyrosine-phosphorylated 105-kDa protein was HEF1 and not a protein of similar size that binds to and co-immunoprecipitates with HEF1, duplicate sets of untreated and CT-stimulated cells were lysed with either the non-ionic lysis buffer described under “Experimental Procedures” or in 0.5% SDS, and immunoprecipitations were performed with the anti-HEF1 number 2. In both cases, the heavily tyrosine-phosphorylated 105-kDa protein was selectively removed from the lysate (data not shown), indicating that this protein is indeed HEF1. Thus, CT induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of HEF1 but not the related p130Cas in CTR-expressing HEK-293 cells. To determine the time course of CT-induced HEF1 tyrosine phosphorylation, C1a-HEK cells were treated with 1 nm CT for increasing periods of time. The cells were lysed, HEF1 was immunoprecipitated with α-HEF1 number 1, and the immune complexes were analyzed for changes in tyrosine phosphorylation by Western blotting (Fig. 2 A). The phosphorylation of HEF1 was detected within 1 min of the addition of CT and reached a maximum by 3 min that was maintained for at least 1 h. To determine the concentration-dependence of CT-induced HEF1 phosphorylation, cells were treated with increasing amounts of CT for 3 min, then lysed, and processed as above (Fig. 2 B). HEF1 phosphorylation was induced by the lowest concentration of CT tested, 0.01 pm, and the maximum effect was achieved with 10 nm CT. Thus, CT induces a strong time- and dose-dependent phosphorylation of HEF1. We then analyzed the signaling pathways involved in the CT-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of HEF1.

During early stages of development, pulmonary elastin is synthesized as a protein precursor, tropoelastin, which is secreted from the cell and undergoes covalent cross-linking by lysyl oxidase to form insoluble elastin fibers within the extracellular matrix (1Raaberg L. Poulsen S.S. Nexo E. Histochemistry. 1991; 95: 471-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 2Rosenbloom J. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 144: 172-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 3Rosenbloom J. Abrams W.R. Mecham R. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1208-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Under normal conditions, once the protein has been synthesized and deposited within the matrix, there is very little turnover of elastin within the adult lung (4Foster J.A. Curtiss S.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: L13-L23PubMed Google Scholar). With the onset of pulmonary obstructive diseases such as emphysema, there is a progressive loss of elastic fibers from the alveolar wall (5Cardoso W.V. Sekhon H.S. Hyde D.M. Thurlbeck W.M. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1993; 147: 975-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 6Finlay G.A. O'Donnell M.D. O'Connor C.M. Hayes J.P. FitzGerald M.X. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 149: 1405-1415PubMed Google Scholar). This loss of elastin is believed to result from chronic injury to the lung due to the release of several proteolytic enzymes, including elastases, from infiltrating inflammatory cells recruited to the site of damage. Whereas damaged elastin fibers can be repaired under acute elastase exposure conditions (7Morris S.M. Thomas K.M. Rich C.B. Stone P.J. Anat. Rec. 1998; 250: 397-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), this repair process is believed to be insufficient under conditions of chronic injury leading to disease. Several animal models have provided valuable insight into the clinical, biochemical, and pathological manifestations of pulmonary emphysema (8Snider G.L. Lucey E.C. Stone P.J. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1986; 133: 149-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). However, due to the presence of multiple cell types present in the lung, attempts to investigate specific molecular and cellular aspects of the disease process in vivo have been limited by the complexity of the system. The use of pulmonary fibroblast cell cultures has provided a unique model system for investigating specific cellular responses to protease-induced injury (9Campagnone R. Regan J. Rich C.B. Miller M. Keene D.R. Sakai L. Foster J.A. Lab. Invest. 1987; 56: 224-230PubMed Google Scholar, 10Foster J.A. Rich C.B. Miller M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15544-15549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF),1 one factor released from the extracellular matrix in response to elastase exposure, has been demonstrated to have potent, negative regulatory effects on elastin steady-state mRNA and protein levels in pulmonary fibroblast cultures and has been identified as a central mediator of elastin repair (11Brettell L.M.

Klein S. Pintucci G. Rifkin D.B. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 26-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). In addition to binding to its cell surface receptors, bFGF also binds to heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) co-receptors that facilitate bFGF-receptor interactions and protect bFGF from proteolytic degradation within the extracellular environment (14Rapraeger A.C. Guimond S. Krufka A. Olwin B.B. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 245: 219-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 15Yanagishita M. Hascall V.C. J. Biol.

Whereas a role for bFGF under conditions of elastase-mediated injury has been established, the mechanism for bFGF release and the consequent effects of elastase on FGF receptor expression and function are not well understood. The focus of this study was to investigate changes in the expression of cell surface bFGF receptors, HSPG co-receptors, and bFGF cellular binding profiles in pulmonary fibroblast cultures after elastase treatment. The results from this study indicate that treatment of pulmonary fibroblasts with elastase selectively releases cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans, which results in a net decrease of bFGF receptor binding. Primary cultures of pulmonary fibroblasts were isolated from the lungs of 3-day-old Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats using established protocols (9Campagnone R. Regan J. Rich C.B. Miller M. Keene D.R. Sakai L. Foster J.A. Lab. Invest. 1987; 56: 224-230PubMed Google Scholar, 10Foster J.A. Rich C.B. Miller M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15544-15549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 1× nonessential amino acid solution, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. For all studies, the cells were maintained for 10–12 days after the second passage before the start of all experiments. At the onset of the experiment, cell cultures were rinsed once with phosphate-buffered saline and twice with 44 mm sodium bicarbonate buffer, pH 7.4. Cells were treated with 44 mm sodium bicarbonate buffer supplemented with or without porcine pancreatic elastase for 15 min at 37 °C as indicated. The elastase concentrations used were based on previous studies that established the range of elastase needed to induce proteolytic damage to the elastin matrix without causing cytotoxic effects (10Foster J.A.

The elastase and bicarbonate solutions were removed from the cell layers, and diisopropyl fluorophosphate was added to a final concentration of 1 μm to inhibit residual elastase activity in the digested fractions. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% fetal bovine serum was added to the cell cultures to inhibit residual elastolytic activity. The cells were incubated on ice for 10 min before the start of subsequent analyses or frozen in liquid nitrogen before extraction. Control and elastase-treated cells were extracted by scraping with a cell lifter in 150 mm sodium chloride, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mmEDTA, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mmsodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 ×g, and the supernatants were collected and assayed for protein content using the Bio-Rad protein assay to standardize the protein amounts applied to the gel. bFGF concentrations in elastase-digested fractions were determined using a commercially available kit from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Total sulfated glycosaminoglycan (GAG) content in elastase-digested fractions was determined by spectrophotometric analysis using the dimethylmethylene blue assay (18Farndale R.W. Buttle D.J. Barrett A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 883: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (2865) Google Scholar). Unknown GAG concentrations were determined from standard curves of chondroitin sulfate. 50 μCi/ml [35S]sulfate was added to pulmonary fibroblast cultures 24 h before elastase treatment.35S-labeled cells were treated with elastase and extracted with 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 8 m urea, 0.1% Triton X-100 and 1 mm sodium sulfate. 35S-labeled heparan sulfate proteoglycans were quantitated by vacuum filtration through cationic nylon (ZetaProbe; Bio-Rad) and nitrous acid treatment (19Rapraeger A. Yeaman C. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Heparinase III was generously provided by Dr. Elizabeth Denholm (Ibex Technologies, Inc, Montreal, Canada). 250 μl aliquots of elastase digested fractions were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C with 0.01 unit/ml heparinase III (EC 4.2.2.8) in 100 mmsodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 150 mm sodium chloride. Control digests were incubated without the enzyme under the same conditions. At the end of the incubation period, samples were precipitated in ice-cold acetone overnight at −20 °C. The precipitated fractions were dried and resuspended in 100 μl of Laemmli sample buffer and boiled for 5 min at 100 °C before SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Elastase-digested fractions and total cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE (20O'Farrell P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) before electrotransfer onto Millipore Immobilon membranes (Milford, MA) (21Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For Western blot analysis, the membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dried milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20. Primary antibody incubations were performed at room temperature for 1 h. The murine monoclonal antibodies used in the present studies were as follows: anti-heparan sulfate (clone 3G10), anti-FGF receptor 1 (clone 19B2), and anti-syndecan-4 (clone 150.1; which was generously provided by Dr. John Couchman, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, AL). The blots were developed using chemiluminescent detection methods (ECL; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 125I-bFGF was prepared using a modification of the Bolton-Hunter method (22Nugent M.A. Edelman E.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8876-8883Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), and equilibrium binding of 125I-bFGF was conducted on pulmonary fibroblast cell cultures immediately after elastase treatment. Elastase-treated cell cultures were rinsed three times with ice-cold binding buffer (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 25 mmHEPES, and 0.05% gelatin) and incubated on ice at 4 °C for 10 min.125I-bFGF was added to each cell well at a final concentration of 2 ng/ml, and the cells were incubated on ice at 4 °C for 2.5 h. In some experiments, total cell-bound125I-bFGF was extracted with 1 n NaOH. In other experiments, HSPG- and receptor-bound125I-bFGF were determined separately using high salt and low pH extraction buffers (23Fannon M. Nugent M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17949-17956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Nonspecific binding was determined for each extraction method with control and elastase-treated cells by competing with increasing concentrations of unlabeled bFGF until no further reduction in label binding was observed (50 μg/ml). 2–6% of the 125I-bFGF was bound nonspecifically in the total bound fraction (1 nNaOH), and 0.5–3.5% of the 125I-bFGF was bound nonspecifically in the HSPG- and receptor-bound fractions. Nonspecific binding was subtracted from all data presented. Pulmonary fibroblasts were seeded at passage 2 onto sterile, glass coverslips and maintained for 14 days and treated with and without elastase. Control and elastase-treated cell cultures were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde, and the coverslips were incubated with either 5 μg/ml anti-heparan sulfate (clone 10E4) or 1% bovine serum albumin-phosphate-buffered saline for 3 h at 37 °C. All coverslips were treated with fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody at a final dilution of 10 μg/ml in 1% bovine serum albumin-phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at 37 °C. Fluorescence was examined using an Olympus IX70 fluorescence microscope. Cell cultures stained with secondary antibody alone were used to establish the fluorescence exposure settings, and these settings were used to analyze the cell cultures stained for heparan sulfate. We have previously reported that elastase treatment of fibroblast cultures results in the release of active bFGF from the extracellular matrix (12Rich C.B. Nugent M.A. Stone P. Foster J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23043-23048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Because bFGF is known to be sequestered in the extracellular matrix through binding to heparan sulfate proteoglycans, elastase might be able to release bFGF by digesting proteoglycan core proteins. Therefore, the ability of elastase to release GAG from pulmonary fibroblasts was analyzed and compared with the release of bFGF. Elastase treatment resulted in a dramatic release of GAG over a range of concentrations where bFGF release was observed (Fig. 1). Exposure of pulmonary fibroblast cell cultures to 0.5 μg/ml elastase for 15 min stimulated the release of GAG by 6-fold compared with that released in the absence of elastase. The addition of 10 μg/ml elastase led to a maximal ∼10-fold increase in the release of GAG compared with control cultures (Fig. 1 A). The amounts of bFGF were also measured in these same samples using a quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Fig. 1 B). Elastase stimulated bFGF release dramatically over this concentration range, with maximal release being observed at 10 μg/ml (∼15-fold increase compared with control cultures). The release of GAG from fibroblast cultures by elastase treatment correlated directly with elastase-mediated bFGF release (r 2 = 0.956; Fig. 1 C). Thus, the mechanism of elastase-mediated bFGF release is likely through disruption of matrix proteoglycans. The ability of elastase to induce the release of GAG was characterized in detail using several approaches. Pulmonary fibroblast cultures were radiolabeled metabolically with [35S]sulfate for 24 h before elastase treatment so that the release of newly synthesized GAG from the cell/extracellular matrix could be quantitated simultaneously with the measurement of GAG appearance in the soluble form. The elastase treatment solutions and cell/extracellular matrix layers were extracted and analyzed for [35S]sulfate-labeled proteoglycan content by filtration through cationic nylon membranes. Elastase caused a dose-dependent loss of cell/extracellular matrix associated35S-GAG and a concomitant increase in soluble35S-GAG (Fig. 2). The fraction of the total 35S-GAG that constituted heparan sulfate (35–55%) in the cell/extracellular matrix extracts and the elastase treatment solutions did not vary with elastase treatment (data not shown). It is possible that elastase releases sulfated GAG by proteolytically digesting the protein cores of the cell-associated proteoglycans. To determine whether elastase treatment caused the release of heparan sulfate proteoglycan core fragments, we conducted immunoblot analyses on elastase extracts. We used an antibody (clone 3G10) that recognizes desaturated uronic acid residues remaining on heparan sulfate proteoglycan core proteins after heparinase III digestion (24David G. Bai X.M. Van Der Schueren B. Cassiman J.J. Van Den Berghe H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 961-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Consequently, for these studies, elastase-digested fractions were treated with heparinase III to selectively degrade heparan sulfate and generate the reactive epitope. Elastase exposure produced a concentration-dependent increase in the release of heparan sulfate proteoglycan core proteins from pulmonary fibroblast cell cultures. In the absence of elastase exposure, a minimal amount of heparinase III-sensitive material was released from the cell layer (Fig. 3 A, lane 1). However, with the addition of elastase concentrations as low as 0.1 μg/ml, the release of HS chains was readily apparent (Fig. 3 A, lanes 2–8). Furthermore, it appeared that elastase cleaved many of the core proteins at multiple sites because higher concentrations of elastase led to a progressive increase in low molecular weight core proteins with a decrease in the high molecular weight species. The immunoreactive bands reflected the presence of the 3G10 antibody epitope because identical analyses of samples treated without heparinase III produced no reactive bands. Furthermore, when heparinase III was analyzed in the absence of sample, no immunoreactive bands were observed (data not shown). Whereas a number of heparan sulfate proteoglycans have been identified, one major class that has been implicated as modulators of bFGF binding and activity are the syndecans (25David G. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1023-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Syndecan-4, in particular, has been detected on fibroblast-like cell types (26Bernfield M. Kokenyesi R. Kato M. Hinkes M.T. Spring J. Gallo R.L. Lose E.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 365-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar). Therefore, heparinase III-treated elastase extracts of pulmonary fibroblast cells were analyzed for the presence of syndecan-4. Immunoblots probed with anti-syndecan-4 antibodies revealed the presence of an immunoreactive band with an apparent Mr = 48,000 (Fig.3 B). The anomalously large syndecan-4 core protein is consistent with previous reports of SDS-PAGE analysis of this protein (27Woods A. Couchman J.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). As with total GAG and heparan sulfate proteoglycan core protein, increasing elastase concentrations resulted in progressively more syndecan-4 release into the digest fractions. Immunoblot analysis of heparinase III-treated whole cell lysates from elastase-treated cells showed no significant difference in the relative amount of syndecan-4 protein remaining at the cell surface after elastase exposure (data not shown). These results suggest that elastase exposure leads to limited proteolytic cleavage of syndecan-4 core proteins. Heparinase III-treated elastase fractions were also subjected to immunoblot analysis using an antibody directed against the major basement membrane heparan sulfate core protein, perlecan. No perlecan core protein was detected in elastase-treated fractions (data not shown). To directly visualize the elastase-mediated loss of heparan sulfate from the pulmonary fibroblasts, cells were stained with a monoclonal antibody against native heparan sulfate and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 4). Extracellular staining for heparan sulfate chains was readily apparent in control cells and in cells treated with 0.5 μg/ml elastase. The addition of elastase concentrations in excess of 2.5 μg/ml to fibroblast cultures resulted in a dramatic loss of extracellular staining for HS sites. This general decrease in extracellular staining is consistent with the loss of HSPG (Figs. 1 and 2) from the cell surface after elastase treatment. Collectively, these studies demonstrate that elastase induced the release of heparan sulfate proteoglycans from pulmonary fibroblast matrices. Because bFGF is known to bind to HSPG, and elastase treatment leads to the release of HSPG from the pulmonary fibroblasts, we investigated how the loss of HSPG sites affected the binding of bFGF to these cells. For these studies, fibroblast cultures were treated with increasing concentrations of elastase, and the cells were subjected to 125I-bFGF equilibrium binding analysis. The administration of increasing concentrations of elastase resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in the amount of total125I-bFGF bound specifically to the cells (Fig.5). Treatment of fibroblast cultures with 2 μg/ml elastase decreased the total 125I-bFGF binding by 35%,whereas treatment of fibroblast cultures with 40 μg/ml elastase resulted in a 99% loss of 125I-bFGF binding. Total binding of 125I-bFGF was found to recover to 88% of control levels 24 h after elastase treatment (data not shown). Maximal loss of125I-bFGF binding sites was also found to be time-dependent, with the maximal loss of total binding occurring after 15 min of elastase exposure (data not shown). Because bFGF can bind to both HSPG and receptor sites, we assessed the effects of elastase treatment on the bFGF receptor and HSPG co-receptor binding sites independently (Fig. 6). For both HSPG and FGF receptor sites, elastase treatment caused a dose-dependent decrease in the binding of125I-bFGF. Treatment with 2 μg/ml elastase decreased binding to HSPG sites by 54% (Fig. 6 A) and decreased binding to receptor sites by nearly 70% (Fig. 6 B). Treatment of fibroblast cultures with 40 μg/ml elastase eliminated more than 98% of the binding interactions at both the HSPG and receptor sites. Collectively, these data indicated that elastase treatment of pulmonary fibroblast cultures significantly decreased the binding of bFGF to both HSPG and cell surface receptor sites. One means by which elastase could affect bFGF receptor binding could be through physical degradation or release of the cell surface receptor protein. To determine whether elastase treatment caused the direct loss of FGF receptors from the cell surface, whole cell lysates from control and elastase-treated cells were subjected to Western blot analysis using a monoclonal antibody generated against FGF receptor 1. No significant difference in the relative amounts of FGF receptor 1 protein was observed in control and elastase-treated cells (Fig.7). These findings were confirmed by fluorescence microscopic analysis (data not shown). Thus, whereas elastase directly removes HSPG, it does not appear to degrade FGF receptors. Therefore, the elastase-mediated decrease in bFGF binding to its receptors is likely a consequence of decreased receptor affinity in the absence of HSPG (23Fannon M. Nugent M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17949-17956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The basic biological features underlying the pathological development and progression of chronic pulmonary obstructive diseases are poorly understood. As one component of these processes, we previously identified basic fibroblast growth factor as a product released by elastase digestion of pulmonary fibroblast cell matrices and documented its potent, negative regulatory effects on elastin gene transcription (12Rich C.B. Nugent M.A. Stone P. Foster J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23043-23048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In the present study, we expand our original findings to address the mechanism of elastase-mediated bFGF release. In this study, we have shown that elastase exposure effectively removes heparan sulfate chains from the cellular surface of pulmonary fibroblasts without an appreciable loss of bFGF receptor protein. Our findings also indicate that elastase exposure causes a concomitant decrease in the binding of bFGF at both HSPG and FGF receptor sites. In the absence of a significant effect at the FGF receptor level, we propose that the mechanism by which elastase decreases bFGF binding to its receptor is through disruption of the complex that bFGF forms with its receptor and the HSPG co-receptor. Based on the loss of available HSPG sites, the affinity of bFGF for its receptor is effectively reduced, which results in a net loss of bFGF binding to its receptor. These findings support previous work from our laboratory that demonstrated that HSPGs enhance bFGF activity by altering the affinity of FGF receptors without a direct consequence on FGF-stimulated signal transduction pathways (23Fannon M. Nugent M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17949-17956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 28Sperinde G.V. Nugent M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13153-13164Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Release of HSPG by elastase from the extracellular matrix would be expected to have significant effects upon bFGF-mediated repair processes. First, the elastase-mediated loss of HSPG sites would be expected to accelerate the rate of bFGF diffusion within the extracellular space. Previous work from our laboratory has demonstrated that HSPG binding plays a key role in restricting bFGF movement within the matrix (29Dowd C.J. Cooney C.L. Nugent M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5236-5244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, in the absence of HSPG binding sites, we predict that bFGF could diffuse unimpeded through pulmonary fibroblast matrices away from the initial sites of damage. Free bFGF would not be subject to the same physical constraints that restrict the transport of bFGF-HSPG complexes within the extracellular matrix. An enhanced rate of diffusion and bioavailability of bFGF due to the loss of HSPG sites may account in part for some of our previous findings in which bFGF elicited differential effects on elastin gene transcription at immediate and distant sites of elastolytic injury (12Rich C.B. Nugent M.A. Stone P. Foster J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23043-23048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Additional studies are necessary to address elastase-mediated changes in bFGF diffusivity within the extracellular environment. In the present study, the observed release of HSPG by elastase is in good agreement with the work of van de Lest et al. (30van de Lest C.H.A. Versteeg E.M.M. Veerkamp J.H. van Kuppevelt T.H. Eur. Respir. J. 1995; 8: 238-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), who demonstrated that proteoglycans are target molecules for elastase instilled in vivo. In both studies, elastase exposure resulted in incomplete cleavage of the core protein with significant loss of heparan sulfate chains. The differences in these two studies may be reflective of differences in heparan sulfate core protein expression in a discrete fibroblast population in vitro and a complex cellular population in vivo. In addition, recent work by van Kuppevelt et al. (31van Kuppevelt T.H. van de Lest C.H.A. Versteeg E.M.M. Dekhuijzen P.N.R. Veerkamp J.H. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1997; 16: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) has indicated that inhibition of proteoglycan synthesis in rat lung by a single instillation of β-d-xyloside resulted in an increase in free GAG in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid that was accompanied by alveolar wall instability and parenchymal tissue destruction. McGowan et al. (32McGowan S.E. Liu R. Harvey C.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 302: 322-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) have reported the ability of heparin and other glycosaminoglycans to modulate elastin synthesis and deposition into pulmonary fibroblast matrices. In addition, heparin and heparan sulfate have been identified as potent protease inhibitors (33Walsh R.L. Dillon T.J. Sicchitano R. McLennan G. Clin. Sci. 1991; 81: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), suggesting a direct role in regulating elastase-mediated injury. Under acute exposure conditions, the elastase-mediated release of HS might be beneficial in that it would initially inhibit elastic fiber proteolysis in vivo. However, under conditions of chronic elastase exposure, the overall effect might favor elastin degradation because HS would be depleted and would no longer be available to inhibit the enzyme directly (34Rao N.V. Kennedy T.P. Rao G. Hoidal J.R. Am. J. Respir. Dis. 1990; 142: 407-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The data presented in this study, in conjunction with previous reports present in the literature, strongly suggest a central role for HSPG in maintaining the structural and functional integrity of the extracellular matrix in normal and disease states. In the present study, we have documented a direct correlation between elastase-mediated release of bFGF and HSPG from pulmonary fibroblast cultures. These findings represent an important initial step in understanding the mechanisms responsible for regulating elastin synthesis under normal and pathological conditions. The ability of bFGF to suppress tropoelastin mRNA and protein levels (11Brettell L.M. McGowan S.E. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1994; 10: 306-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and elastin gene transcription (12Rich C.B. Nugent M.A. Stone P. Foster J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23043-23048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) in pulmonary fibroblasts has been fairly well established, whereas the role of HSPGs in these processes is not well understood. We propose that HSPGs play a significant role in the regulation of elastin metabolism within the extracellular matrix by maintaining basic organization and function and by modulating bFGF release and activity. In vivo, HSPGs within the extracellular matrix protect bFGF from proteolytic degradation and sequester it within the matrix to create a discrete pool of active growth factor. Our findings suggest that localized proteolytic cleavage of HSPG core proteins by elastase could directly affect the activity of bFGF released at the site of elastolytic injury. During the initial periods of elastase exposure, bFGF, released as a putative complex with HSPG, would stimulate elastin synthesis in the injured cells and suppress elastin synthesis in the surrounding noninjured areas. However, under conditions of chronic elastase release (i.e. inflammation), the continued release and diffusion of bFGF and HS away from the site of injury would prevent the injured cells from initiating the appropriate elastin repair responses and would favor elastin catabolism. In summary, we have measured elastase-mediated heparan sulfate release from pulmonary fibroblast cultures and characterized the consequent effects on basic fibroblast growth factor receptor binding. We have found that under conditions that promote the release of bFGF from the matrix, there is a coincident release of HS and HSPG core proteins without an appreciable loss of bFGF receptor protein. These results suggest that the mechanism by which elastase decreased bFGF binding is through destabilization of the bFGF-fibroblast growth factor receptor-HSPG ternary complex following proteolytic cleavage of HSPG. Whereas bFGF is still able to bind to its receptor and initiate the appropriate signaling responses after elastase exposure, our data suggest a regulatory function for HSPG in modulating the activity of bFGF and other heparin binding growth factors within the lung under acute and chronic elastase exposure conditions.

Dreyer F. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1986; 129: 93-179PubMed Google Scholar). The toxin is synthesized as a single polypeptide (Mr = 150,000), released by bacterial lysis, and cleaved to form an active dichain toxin with the heavy and light chains linked through one disulfide bond. The carboxyl-terminal half of the heavy chain constitutes the receptor binding domain, the amino-terminal half of the heavy chain is responsible for membrane translocation of the toxin, and the light chain contains the catalytic domain (for review, see Ref. 2Montecucco C. Schiavo G. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1995; 28: 423-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Upon entering the synaptic cytosol, the toxin arrests neurotransmitter release by its action as a zinc endopeptidase, which cleaves vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP), a synaptic vesicle integral membrane protein believed to be critical for neuroexocytosis (3Schiavo G.

Miller P. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1961; 24: 107-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), there have been a number of studies (for review, see Ref. 6Niemann H. Alouf J.E. Freer J.H. Sourcebook of Bacterial Protein Toxins. Academic Press, London1991: 303-348Google Scholar) characterizing the binding of TeNT to gangliosides in various in vitro and in vivo preparations. Although it is difficult to assign an affinity to this binding (7Halpern J.L. Neale E.A. Montecucco C. Clostridial Neurotoxins: The Molecular Pathogenesis of Tetanus and Botulism. 195. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1995: 221-241Google Scholar), there is general agreement that TeNT shows the highest affinity for GT1b and GD1b polysialogangliosides, although not nearly as high as the affinity of cholera toxin for its known GM1 ganglioside receptor. It has been suggested that gangliosides participate in pore formation (9Winter A. Ulrich W.P. Wetterich F. Weller U. Galla H.J. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1996; 81: 21-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), intracellular targeting (10Shapiro R.E. Specht C.D. Collins B.E. Woods A.S. Cotter R.J. Schnaar R.L. J. Biol.

Toxicon. 1989; 27: 849-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and differentiation of PC12 cells with nerve growth factor increases the expression of complex gangliosides and enhances TeNT binding (13Walton K.M.

Res. 1990; 15: 373-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Although for PC12 cells nerve growth factor-induced differentiation is critical, it is not clear that enhanced ganglioside synthesis is sufficient for conferring toxin sensitivity (15Sandberg K. Berry C.J. Rogers T.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5679-5686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, degradation of polysialogangliosides on the neuronal surface with neuraminidase treatment does not diminish sensitivity to TeNT (16Bigalke H. Muller H. Dreyer F. Toxicon. 1986; 24: 1065-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thus, the role of gangliosides in the delivery of TeNT to its substrate is not clear. Moreover, TeNT binding, assessed on various neuronal membrane preparations, decreases after protease treatment (17Critchley D.R. Habig W.H. Fishman P.H. J.

Neurophysiol. 1987; 57: 121-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In a previous study, we examined the effect of TeNT on potassium-evoked neurotransmitter release in murine spinal cord cell cultures (25Williamson L.C. Fitzgerald S.C. Neale E.A. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 2148-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and demonstrated that inhibitory glycinergic neurons are particularly sensitive to the toxin.In the present study, we assess the role of gangliosides as functional receptors for TeNT in spinal cord cultures grown in the presence of the mycotoxin fumonisin B1 (FB1), an inhibitor of ganglioside synthesis. Fumonisin B1 inhibits ceramide synthase, an enzyme required for the formation of ceramide, a precursor of ganglioside production (26Wang E. Norred W.P. Bacon C.W. Riley R.T. Merrill Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14486-14490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tetanus toxin binding was examined qualitatively in cultures grown in the presence or absence of FB1 using the carboxyl terminus of the toxin heavy chain (the binding fragment) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) or by immunohistochemistry using holotoxin and a monoclonal antibody. Toxin action was assayed by potassium-evoked release of the inhibitory neurotransmitter glycine, by activity-dependent uptake of the styryl dye FM1-43 into synaptic terminals, and by immunohistochemistry and immunoblot analysis of VAMP cleavage. This study demonstrates that chronic FB1 treatment of spinal cord cell cultures virtually eliminates gangliosides and TeNT binding to the neuronal surface and essentially eliminates action of TeNT. Furthermore, replenishing ganglioside-depleted cultures with exogenous gangliosides fully restores sensitivity to TeNT.RESULTSMouse spinal cord cultures grown for 3 weeks, from day 2 after plating, in the continuous presence of 20 μmFB1 show some decrease in neuron survival but no difference in overall morphology from untreated cultures. From neuronal cell counts (31 fields/dish, 3 dishes for each condition), we estimate the total number of neurons in control cultures at 2.86 × 105 and in FB1-treated cultures at 2.49 × 105. Thus, cell counts indicate a 13% loss of neurons because of FB1 treatment. Control and treated cultures appear similar, however, by phase contrast microscopy (Fig.1). We further examined neuronal morphology by immunohistochemistry using monoclonal antibodies against microtubule-associated protein 2 as a marker for dendrites, against phosphorylated neurofilaments for axons, and against synaptophysin for synaptic terminals (Fig. 2). Control and FB1-treated neurons exhibit similar immunostaining for dendrites (Fig. 2, A and B), axons (Fig. 2, C and D), and synaptic terminals (Fig. 2, E and F).Figure 2Fumonisin B1 effects on neuronal morphology. Spinal cord neurons in culture grown for 3 weeks in the absence (A, C, and E) or presence (B, D, and F) of FB1 (20 μm) were immunostained with monoclonal antibodies against microtubule-associated protein 2 (A and B) to label dendrites, against phosphorylated neurofilaments (C and D) to label axons, and against the synaptic vesicle protein synaptophysin (E and F) to label synaptic terminals.

The loss of gangliosides from cells in FB1-treated cultures was confirmed by thin layer chromatography and quantified by scintillation spectrometry (Fig.3). Total radioactivity that comigrates with GT1b, GD1b, GD1a, and GM1 ganglioside standards is reduced more than 93% in FB1-treated cultures compared with controls. Specifically, GD1b and GM1 are each depleted to 10% of control levels and GT1b and GD1a to 1 and 4%, respectively.Figure 3Thin layer chromatography of radiolabeled gangliosides extracted from 3-week-old spinal cord cultures grown in the absence (open symbols) or presence (closed symbols) of FB1 (20 μm).

We first examined the effect of FB1 on toxin binding using fragment C, the binding domain of TeNT, conjugated to HRP. Essentially no peroxidase reaction product is seen in FB1-treated cultures (Fig.4 B) in comparison to controls (Fig. 4 A), suggesting very little fragment C binding to these neurons. We also failed to detect the binding of tetanus holotoxin to FB1-treated cultures using indirect immunofluorescence with a monoclonal antibody that stabilizes toxin binding, enhancing it by greater than 2-fold when premixed with toxin (36Habig W.H.

Intense immunostaining of TeNT to the surface of neuronal membranes is exhibited in control cultures (Fig. 4 C) in marked contrast to the absence of immunoreactivity in FB1-treated cultures (Fig. 4 D). Thus, using saturating levels of fragment C-HRP (2.5 μg/ml) or tetanus holotoxin (4 μg/ml), we were not able to visualize TeNT bound to spinal cord neurons in FB1-treated cultures. Moreover, the HRP-conjugated fragment B of cholera toxin, which binds GM1 gangliosides, labels the surface of control neurons (Fig.4 E) but is essentially absent from FB1-treated neurons (Fig. 4 F), providing further evidence for the loss of gangliosides from these cultures.Figure 4TeNT and cholera toxin binding to spinal cord neurons in control (A, C, and E) and FB1 -treated (B, D, and F) cultures. Fragment C of TeNT conjugated to HRP (A and B), tetanus holotoxin premixed with the monoclonal antibody 18.2.12.6 (C and D), or fragment B of cholera toxin conjugated to HRP (E and F) was added to cultures for 30 min at room temperature. Very little peroxidase reaction product is seen on neuronal surfaces in FB1-treated cultures (20 μm for 3 weeks) incubated with TeNT fragment C (B) or cholera toxin fragment B (F) compared with their respective control cultures (A and E). Virtually no immunostaining for tetanus holotoxin was detected in cultures grown in the presence of FB1 (D) in comparison to control cultures (C).

We used activity-dependent uptake of the styryl dye FM1-43 (37Betz W.J. Bewick G.S. Science. 1992; 255: 200-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar) as a qualitative measure of TeNT-induced synaptic quiescence. In functional synaptic terminals, FM1-43 present during neuronal stimulation labels nerve terminal surface membrane that is endocytosed for synaptic vesicle recycling. In control and FB1-treated neurons (without TeNT), FM1-43 labels synaptic terminals that have undergone synaptic vesicle exo- and endocytosis as a consequence of stimulation with 56 mm potassium and 2 mm calcium (Fig. 5, A and C). As expected, TeNT substantially inhibits the uptake of FM1-43 in control cultures (Fig. 5 B). In contrast, the effect of TeNT in blocking FM1-43 uptake into synaptic vesicles in FB1-grown cultures is minimal (Fig.5 D). FM1-43 uptake persists in FB1-grown neurons exposed to blocking concentrations of TeNT, indicative of synaptic vesicle recycling in active terminals.Figure 5Fumonisin B1 effect on TeNT blockade of synaptic activity. Control and FB1-treated cultures were exposed to 0.6 nm TeNT for 30 min at 4 °C and then warmed for 90 min at 35 °C. Activity-dependent uptake of FM1-43 into synaptic terminals is seen as punctate fluorescence in control (A) and FB1-treated (20 μm for 3 weeks) cultures (C). FM1-43 uptake is inhibited in cultures exposed to TeNT (B), which is evidence of a block in synaptic vesicle recycling. However, in cultures grown in the presence of FB1, TeNT has little effect on FM1-43 uptake into synaptic terminals (D), indicating the persistence of synaptic activity in the presence of blocking concentrations of TeNT. Magnification bar, 25 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The role of gangliosides in TeNT internalization and subsequent action was quantified by measuring toxin-induced inhibition of glycine release in cultures grown in the presence or absence of FB1 (Fig.6). Cultures were incubated in 0.03 nm (5 ng/ml) TeNT as described for FM1-43 uptake. Under the conditions of the assay, TeNT blocks potassium-evoked calcium-dependent release of [3H]glycine by 40–45% in control cultures. [3H]Glycine release is depressed by about 15% in cultures treated chronically with FB1, consistent with the decrease in neuron survival. However, when added to FB1-treated cultures, TeNT is unable to produce any further reduction in release. Thus, the effectiveness of TeNT in blocking neurotransmitter release is abrogated in spinal cord neurons without gangliosides.Figure 6Fumonisin B1 effect on TeNT blockade of evoked glycine release. Control (C) and FB1-treated cultures (20 μm for 3 weeks) were exposed to 0.03 nm TeNT for 30 min at 4 °C, rinsed, and then warmed for 90 min at 35 °C. Release of [3H]glycine was evoked with medium containing 56 mm potassium and 2 mm calcium. TeNT arrests glycine release by almost 45% in control cultures without FB1 treatment. In contrast, TeNT has no effect on glycine release in cultures grown in the presence of FB1. Control cultures in these experiments released about 31 ± 2% of total [3H]glycine with potassium depolarization.n = 10 for each condition, four experiments.T, tetanus toxin; F, fumonisin B1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The proteolytic activity of TeNT on VAMP cleavage in control and FB1-treated cultures was assessed using double-stain immunohistochemistry for VAMP and synapsin 1a. In control cultures, VAMP immunoreactivity is found in synaptic terminals (Fig.7 B) identified using antisynapsin 1a to label synaptic vesicles (Fig. 7 A). In cultures exposed for 24 h to 0.06 nm TeNT, synapsin 1a immunoreactivity is similar to that seen in control cultures (Fig.7 C), whereas VAMP immunostaining is abolished (Fig.7 D). Chronic treatment with FB1 prevents ganglioside production but does not alter either synapsin 1a (Fig.7 E) or VAMP (Fig. 7 F) immunostaining. Finally, in cultures grown in FB1, TeNT exposure has little discernible effect on VAMP immunoreactivity (Fig. 7 H) as assessed qualitatively by fluorescence intensity and colocalization with synapsin 1a (Fig. 7 G).Figure 7Fumonisin B1 effect on VAMP proteolysis by TeNT. Synapsin 1a (A, C, E, and G) and VAMP (B, D, F, and H) immunoreactivities colocalize in cultures grown for 3 weeks in the absence (A and B) or presence (E and F) of 20 μm FB1. In contrast, in cultures treated with TeNT (0.06 nm for 24 h), synapsin 1a marks synaptic terminals (C) in which VAMP immunostaining is abolished (D). In FB1-treated cultures, TeNT has little effect on VAMP immunostaining (H), which colocalizes with synapsin 1a (G). Magnification bar, 25 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)VAMP cleavage after a 24-h exposure to TeNT (same conditions as described above for immunohistochemistry) in control and FB1-treated cultures was evaluated by immunoblot analysis of VAMP in relation to syntaxin (Fig. 8). Tetanus toxin completely cleaves VAMP in control cultures grown in the absence of FB1. In contrast, VAMP is detected readily in cultures grown in the presence of FB1 regardless of the presence of TeNT. These data indicate that ganglioside-depleted neurons show significant protection from TeNT effects, most likely because of the inability of TeNT to bind efficiently to the neuronal surface and undergo internalization into the neuronal cytosol.Figure 8Immunoblot analysis of VAMP cleavage by TeNT. VAMP proteolysis was evaluated relative to syntaxin, another synaptic protein, in cultures grown for 3 weeks in the absence or presence of 20 μm FB1. VAMP immunoreactivity is abolished in control cultures exposed to TeNT (0.06 nmfor 24 h). In FB1-treated cultures, there appears to be little degradation of VAMP even after treatment with TeNT.Con, control; Fum, fumonisin B1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To establish the physiologic role of gangliosides in mediating the action on TeNT, we replenished FB1-treated neurons with exogenous gangliosides. Experiments were performed on a 3–4-week-old control and FB1 cultures in which the culture medium was replaced, 24 h prior to assay, with MEM with or without FB1 or with MEM containing gangliosides with or without FB1. Cultures were loaded with [3H]glycine and incubated in 0.03 nm TeNT (5 ng/ml, 150 mouse lethal doses/culture) as described. Glycine release under eight experimental conditions was compared in any given experiment. Fig.9 illustrates results from two experiments in which cultures had been preincubated with bovine mixed brain gangliosides at 50 μg/ml. In these experiments, FB1affords complete protection against TeNT. Relative to control cultures preincubated with gangliosides, TeNT inhibits glycine release by almost 50%. Similarly, TeNT in FB1-treated cultures preincubated with gangliosides produces a 52% block in release. Thus, exogenous gangliosides added back to ganglioside-depleted neurons fully restore the action of TeNT. As anticipated, the ganglioside supplement also restores TeNT association with the neuronal surface membrane (Fig. 9, lower panel). Because the added gangliosides insert into depleted glial membranes as well, these cells also exhibit TeNT binding not usually observed on glial cells in control cultures.Figure 9Exogenous gangliosides restore TeNT effect in FB1-treated cultures. Upper panel, control and FB1-treated cultures were incubated for 24 h in 50 μg/ml mixed brain gangliosides in MEM, loaded with [3H]glycine, exposed to 0.03 nm TeNT for 30 min at 4 °C, washed, and, after 90 min at 35 °C to allow toxin internalization, assayed for potassium-stimulated release of [3H]glycine. As shown in Fig. 6, [3H]glycine release is somewhat reduced from controls in cultures treated with FB1. TeNT at 0.03 nminhibits release by about 40% in controls and by 48% in control cultures incubated with gangliosides. TeNT has no effect at this concentration in FB1-treated cultures. However, the addition of gangliosides to FB1-treated, ganglioside-depleted cultures completely restores TeNT action with the toxin blocking 51% of [3H]glycine release. In control cultures, 31 ± 1.4% of total [3H]glycine is released by potassium depolarization. n = 5 for each condition, two experiments.

Lower panel, tetanus toxin binding visualized using antibody 18.2.12.6 and rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody. TeNT adheres to neuronal surface membranes in control cultures, whereas toxin binding in FB1-treated cultures is barely detectable. TeNT toxin binding to ganglioside-depleted neurons is restored by the addition of 50 μg/ml mixed brain gangliosides (MBG) or GD1b (7.5 μg/ml) and GT1b (5.0 μg/ml) to the culture medium for 24 h prior to staining. This treatment also caused the appearance of TeNT binding sites on the surface of glial cells. Magnification bar, 25 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Similar experiments (data not shown) provide preliminary results that indicate that 30 μg/ml mixed brain gangliosides are somewhat less effective (42% toxin-induced block in controls plus gangliosides, 24% block in FB1 cultures plus gangliosides). In one experiment, only GD1b and GT1b were used as the supplement at the concentration at which they were present in the 50 μg/ml ganglioside mixture, i.e. 7.5 μg/ml GD1b and 5 μg/ml GT1b. In this experiment, the TeNT block in glycine release was 62% in control cultures with gangliosides and 65% in FB1 cultures with gangliosides. Thus, GD1b and GT1b appear to be as effective in restoring toxin sensitivity as the ganglioside mixture.DISCUSSIONSpinal cord neurons in cultures treated chronically with FB1 exhibit a greater than 90% decrease in ganglioside synthesis and significant protection against the effects of TeNT. Full sensitivity to TeNT is restored by a 24-h incubation, in the continued presence of FB1, in medium containing exogenous gangliosides.The survival of neurons grown in 20 μm FB1for 3 weeks is somewhat compromised, although the treated neurons develop dendrites, axons, and synaptic terminals similar to those of neurons with normal ganglioside synthesis. Comparable observations were reported for hippocampal neurons in culture (38Schwarz A. Rapaport E. Hirschberg K. Futerman A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10990-10998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar); that is, long term incubation (12–14 days) with FB1 failed to elicit changes in neuronal morphology.We did observe that dividing glial cells were affected severely by FB1 treatment, consistent with the report that interference with endogenous GM1 by the β-subunit of cholera toxin leads to an inhibition of DNA synthesis and astroglial cell proliferation (39Facci L. Skaper S.D. Favaron M. Leon A. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 821-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The inability of astroglia to proliferate posed a technical problem for our studies. Dissociated spinal cord cells at plating contain both glia and neurons. Normally, glia attach to the culture substrate, proliferate, and spread; neurons adhere best to glial surfaces. Chronic FB1 treatment renders such cultures fragile in that neurons without a"

We have previously shown that fU is a potentially mutagenic lesion due to its elevated frequency to mispair with guanine. Therefore, fU can exist in DNA as a correctly paired fU:A form or an incorrectly paired fU:G form. In this work, fU was site-specifically incorporated opposite A in oligonucleotide substrates to delineate the cellular repair mechanism of fU paired with A. The repair activity for fU was induced in Escherichia coli upon exposure to N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, and the induction was dependent on the alkA gene, suggesting that AlkA (3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase II) was responsible for the observed activity. Activity assay and determination of kinetic parameters using purified AlkA and defined oligonucleotide substrates containing fU, 5-hydroxymethyluracil (hU), or 7-methylguanine (7mG) revealed that fU was recognized by AlkA with an efficiency comparable to that of 7mG, a good substrate for AlkA, whereas hU, another major thymine methyl oxidation products, was not a substrate. 1H and 13C NMR chemical shifts of 5-formyl-2′-deoxyuridine indicated that the 5-formyl group caused base C-6 and sugar C-1′ to be electron deficient, which was shown to result in destabilization of the N-glycosidic bond. These features are common in other good substrates for AlkA and are suggested to play key roles in the differential recognition of fU, hU, and intact thymine. Three mammalian repair enzymes for alkylated and oxidized bases cloned so far (MPG, Nth1, and OGG1) did not recognize fU, implying that the mammalian repair activity for fU resided on a yet unidentified protein.

To cope with genotoxicity associated with oxidative base damage, cells have evolved a number of repair enzymes that specifically recognize unique structural features of altered bases and remove them from DNA (1Friedberg E.C.

Among the repair enzymes that recognize oxidative base damage from four bases, those for thymine damage have been best identified and characterized, because the chemical nature of oxidative thymine damage has been established considerably well (3von Sonntag C.

Similar to E. coli endonuclease III, eukaryotic endonuclease III homologues appear to recognize urea type products, as well as group I products (15Roldan-Arjona T. Anselmino C. Lindahl T.

Repair enzymes for group III and IV products have been much less clarified compared with those for group I and II products. Available data indicate that 5-hydroxy-5-methylhydantoin, a group III product, is a substrate of E. coli endonuclease III (8Breimer L.H. Lindahl T. J. Biol.

Concerning the repair of the group IV products, mammalian cells contain an activity that releases hU from DNA (26Hollstein M.C. Brooks P. Linn S. Ames B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4003-4007Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 27Cannon-Carlson S.V. Gokhale H. Teebor G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13306-13312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, hU itself is neither a lethal nor mutagenic lesion (28Levy D.D. Teebor G.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3337-3343Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Thus, further characterization of the activity and elucidation of the physiological role remain to be performed. We have recently shown that fU belonging to group IV products forms a mispair with guanine in addition to a correct base pair with adenine during DNA replication (29Yoshida M. Makino K. Morita H. Terato H. Ohyama Y. Ide H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1570-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Ionization of fU promoted by the electron-withdrawing formyl group is involved in the mispairing between fU and guanine. It has been also demonstrated that the nucleoside and nucleotide forms of fU undergo specific modification by cysteine derivatives, although the biological relevance of this modification remains to be elucidated (30Terato H. Morita H. Ohyama Y. Ide H. Nucleosides Nucleotides. 1998; 17: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In addition, exogenous 5-formyl-2′-deoxyuridine added to the culture medium exhibits the mutagenic effect on Salmonella TA102 and human cells (31Kasai H. Iida A. Yamaizumi Z. Nishimura S. Tanooka H. Mutat. Res. 1990; 243: 249-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar,32Bjelland S. Eide L. Time R.W. Stote R. Eftedal I. Volden G. Seeberg E.

Chem. 1994; 269: 30489-30495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) found that fU was released from aged and photo-oxidized DNA by E. coli AlkA protein (3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase II) during a survey of the substrate specificity of the enzyme. Subsequently, it was reported that the activity that release fU from damaged DNA was present in crude extracts of mammalian cells (32Bjelland S. Eide L. Time R.W. Stote R. Eftedal I. Volden G.

Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25144-25150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), we prepared oligonucleotide substrates containing fU as unique damage and studied the repair of fU to obtain further insight into the cellular repair mechanism. The use of defined oligonucleotide substrates, which was not achieved in the previous studies, is essential to compare the substrate specificity and kinetic parameters of repair enzymes. More importantly, fU could be present in two different base pairs in DNA, i.e. a correctly paired fU:A form and a mispaired fU:G form. We report here that fU paired with A is specifically removed by E. coli AlkA protein with an efficiency comparable to that of 7-methylguanine (this paper). Furthermore, an fU:G mismatch generated during DNA replication is likely to be subjected to repair by both AlkA protein and the MutHLS mismatch correction system (68Terato H. Masaoka A. Kobayashi M.

Four normal dNTPs were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) was from Wako. Preparation of 5-formyl-2′-deoxyuridine 5′-triphosphate (fdUTP) was reported previously (29Yoshida M. Makino K. Morita H. Terato H. Ohyama Y. Ide H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1570-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). 5-Hydroxymethyl-2′-deoxyuridine 5′-triphosphate (hdUTP) was synthesized by NaBH4 reduction of fdUTP and extensively purified by HPLC as described for fdUTP (29Yoshida M. Makino K. Morita H. Terato H. Ohyama Y. Ide H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1570-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The structure and purity of hdUTP were confirmed by alkaline phosphatase digestion of the triphosphate to the corresponding nucleoside followed by reversed phase HPLC analysis (data not shown). 3′,5′-Di-O-accetylthymidine and 3′,5′-di-O-acetyl-5-formyl-2′-deoxyuridine were synthesized according to the reported methods (35Ono A.

E. coli JM105 (endA1, supE, sbcB15, thi, rpsL, Δ(lac-proAB)/F′ (traD36, proAB + , lacI q , lacZΔM15)) was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The following buffers were used for enzyme reactions: Buffer A for Pol I Klenow fragment, 66 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 6.6 mm MgCl2; Buffer B for AlkA, 70 mmHepes-KOH (pH 7.8), 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm2-mercaptoethanol; Buffer C for hMPG, 35 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.4), 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mmdithiothreitol; Buffer D for mNth1, 20 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 8.0), 50 mm KCl, 0.25 mm EDTA, 0.25 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin; Buffer E for endonuclease IV, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA; and Buffer F for hOGG1, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Gel loading buffer consisted of 0.05% xylene cyanol, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 20 mm EDTA, and 98% formamide. E. coli DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment and T4 polynucleotide kinase were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. and New England BioLabs, respectively. E. coli endonuclease IV was a gift from Hatahet and Wallace (University of Vermont). Human methylpurine DNA glycosylase (hMPG/Anpg) and 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (hOGG1/hMMH, splicing isoform 1a) were obtained from Kubo (38Asaeda A. Ide H. Tano K. Takamori Y. Kubo K.

The mouse endonuclease III homologue (mNth1) was purified from E. coli NKJ1004 (nth− nei−) harboring plasmid PEK/mNth1 (18Sarker A.H. Ikeda S. Nakano H. Terato H. Ide H. Imai K. Akiyama K. Tsutsui K.

Based on the published sequence data (40Nakabeppu Y. Miyata T. Kondo H. Iwanaga S. Sekiguchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13730-13736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the alkA gene containing upstream 2 and downstream 57 extra nucleotides from the start and stop codons, respectively, was amplified by PCR from E. coli K12 genomic DNA using primers PCR-FW and PCR-RV (TableI). The amplified gene (approximately 1 kilobase) was restricted by Eco RI and Hin dIII, and inserted into the Eco RI/Hin dIII site of pKK223-3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The plasmid containing the alkA gene was designated pAlkA. The whole nucleotide sequence of the inserted alkA gene was confirmed by DNA sequencing. E. coli JM105 transformed with pAlkA was grown in LB medium (5 l) supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C in a jar fermenter, and the alkA gene was induced by the addition IPTG (0.4 mm) at an absorbance of 0.2. Incubation was continued for further 9 h at 37 °C with aeration. Cells were collected by centrifugation, washed with 40 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), and disrupted by the lysozyme treatment and repeated freeze-thaw cycles. Crude AlkA protein was precipitated by ammonium sulfate (45% saturation) and purified by the successive chromatography using HiLoad Superdex 75 pg, Resource S, and Resource Q columns (all columns were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) following the reported procedure (33Bjelland S. Birkeland N. Benneche T. Volden G. Seeberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30489-30495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ten N-terminal amino acid residues of the purified protein were determined by a protein sequencer and were consistent with those expected from the DNA sequence. The AlkA protein concentration after the Resource Q column was determined by UV absorption assuming ε280 = 59,400, 2Y.

Oligonucleotides except 25T, 25FU, 25HU, 25MG, 25FP, 19TG, and M1 were synthesized by the standard phosphoramidite method and purified by reversed phase HPLC. 25FU and 25HU containing fU and hU, respectively, at the 16th position from the 5′-terminus were prepared by the enzymatic extension of primer P1. Typically, P1 was 5′-end labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (110 TBq/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and T4 polynucleotide kinase and purified as described (41Ide H. Okagami M. Murayama H. Kimura Y. Makino K. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1993; 31: 485-491PubMed Google Scholar). P1 annealed to the template 30A (12.5 pmol as a template/primer) in Buffer A (total volume, 500 μl) was extended by E. coli DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment (90 units) with fdUTP (100 μm) or hdUTP (100 μm) at 37 °C for 5 min and then with additional dATP, dGTP, and dCTP (100 μm each) for 30 min (29Yoshida M. Makino K. Morita H. Terato H. Ohyama Y. Ide H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1570-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The reaction was terminated by the addition of EDTA (final concentration, 25 mm). The reaction mixture was extracted with phenol, and duplex 25FU/30A and 25HU/30A were precipitated by ethanol. They were resuspended in water (100 μl), purified by Sephadex G-25 chromatography (bed volume, 2 ml), and recovered by ethanol precipitation. Duplex 25T/30A was prepared by the same procedure except that dTTP was used instead of fdUTP in the DNA polymerase reaction. It is noted that fully replicated products 25FU and 25T were 25-mer in length. This design aided separation of these oligonucleotides from longer template 30A by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis when single stranded 25FU and 25T were needed to construct heteroduplex substrates in MutS binding experiments described in the accompanying paper (68Terato H. Masaoka A. Kobayashi M. Fukushima S. Ohyama Y. Yoshida M. Ide H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25144-25150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Duplex 25MG/30C containing 7-methylguanine (7mG) was prepared and purified in a manner essentially similar to that described for 25FU/30A. 5′-Labeled P2 was annealed to the template 30C and elongated in the presence of dCTP, dTTP, 7-methyl-2′-dGTP (100 μm each). 7mG incorporated into 25MG was stable when stored at 4 °C or below so that no detectable sites sensitive to endonuclease IV (abasic sites) or formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase (2,6-diamino-4-hydroxy-5-N-methylformamidopyrimidine (Fapy)) were generated during the storage. Duplex 25FP/30C containing Fapy was prepared by alkali treatment of 25MG/30C. The details of the synthesis and characterization of the oligonucleotides containing 7mG and Fapy will be published elsewhere. 3H. Terato, T. Yamada, K. Asagoshi, Y. Ohyama, and H. Ide, manuscript in preparation.19TG containing a thymine glycol was prepared by KMnO4oxidation of the oligonucleotide containing a single thymine at the same position and was extensively purified by reversed phase HPLC (42Kao J.Y. Goljer I. Phan T.A. Bolton P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17787-17793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The marker oligonucleotide M1 was prepared by the treatment of 19TG with 10% piperidine at 90 °C for 30 min. To analyze induction of repair activities by MNNG, E. coli MV1161 (alkA +) and MV1571 (alkA−) were treated with MNNG as reported previously (43Saparbaev M. Laval J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5873-5877Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). E. coli MV1161 and MV1571 were grown overnight in LB medium in the absence (MV1161) and presence (MV1571) of 50 μg/ml ampicillin. The overnight cultures were inoculated into the same fresh medium with 8-fold dilution. After 3 h of incubation at 37 °C with shaking, MNNG was added to the medium at a final concentration of 20 μm, and incubation was continued for 1.5 h at 37 °C. Cells were collected by centrifugation, and 0.2 g of wet cells was treated by 1 mg/ml lysozyme in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm EDTA (total volume, 0.5 ml) and then subjected to repeated freeze-thaw cycles three times. Cell debris were removed by centrifugation, and the protein concentration of the supernatant was determined by the BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce). Repair activities for fU and 7mG in the crude cell extracts were assayed as follows. 5′-End labeled oligonucleotide substrates (25FU/30A and 25MG/30C, 20 nm) were incubated with 20 μg of crude cell extracts in Buffer B (50 μl) at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction mixtures was extracted by phenol. Oligonucleotides were precipitated by ethanol and resuspended in Buffer E (10 μl). Endonuclease IV (4 ng) was added to the reaction mixture, and incubation was continued at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by adding gel loading buffer. Samples were subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) analysis. The repair activity for fU in crude cell extract from E. coli JM105 harboring pAlkA or pKK223-3 (control) was assayed as follows. E. coli JM105 harboring pAlkA or pKK223-3 was grown in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C overnight. The overnight culture was inoculated in fresh LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin with 16-fold dilution. After 3 h of incubation at 37 °C, IPTG was added to the medium at a final concentration 0.4 mm. Cells were collected at appropriate incubation times and stored frozen at −80 °C. Cell extracts were prepared, and the repair activity was assayed using substrates 25FU/30A and 25MG/30C, as described for the MNNG treatment. Oligonucleotide substrates, such as 25FU/30A and 25MG/30C (typically 20 nm), were incubated with AlkA protein (10 ng) in Buffer B (10 μl) at 37 °C for 10 min unless otherwise noted. After incubation, DNA was purified by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. The purified DNA was incubated with endonuclease IV (4 ng) at 37 °C for 30 min in Buffer E (10 μl), mixed with gel loading buffer, and finally subjected to gel electrophoresis. Kinetic parameters of AlkA for fU and 7mG were determined in an essentially similar manner using substrates 25FU/30A and 25MG/30C with a concentration range of 5–100 nm. Reactions with mammalian enzymes were performed as follows. 19TG and 25OG were 5′-end labeled and purified as described above and annealed to the complementary strands 19A and 30C, respectively. 19TG/19A and 25FU/30A (20 nm) were incubated with mNth1 (1–10 ng) in Buffer D (10 μl) at 37 °C for 30 min. 25OG/30C, 25FP/30C, and 25FU/30A (20 nm) were also treated in a similar manner by hOGG1(60 ng) in Buffer F (10 μl). 25MG/30C and 25FU/30A (20 nm) were incubated with hMPG (5–50 ng) in Buffer C (10 μl) at 37 °C for 30 min. For hMPG, DNA was purified and further treated with endonuclease IV as described for AlkA. After adjusting total radioactivity, samples in gel loading buffer were loaded onto a 16% denaturing polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresed at 2000 V for 2–3 h. The gel was autoradiographed at −80 °C. The radioactivity of separated bands wa"

CymA is essential for growth on cyclodextrins, but it can also complement the deficiency of a lamB (maltoporin) mutant of Escherichia coli for growth on linear maltodextrins, indicating that both cyclic and linear oligosaccharides are accepted as substrates. CymA was overproduced in E. coli and purified to apparent homogeneity. CymA is a component of the outer membrane, is processed from a signal peptide-containing precursor, and possesses a high content of antiparallel β-sheet. Incorporation of CymA into lipid bilayers and conductance measurements revealed that it forms ion-permeable channels, which exhibit a substantial current noise. CymA-induced membrane conductance decreased considerably upon addition of α-cyclodextrin. Titration experiments allowed the calculation of a half-saturation constant, KS, of 28 μm for its binding to CymA. CymA assembled in vitro to two-dimensionally crystalline tubular membranes, which, on electron microscopy, are characterized by a p 1-related two-sided plane group. The crystallographic unit cell contains four monomeric CymA molecules showing a central pore. The lattice parameters are a = 16.1 nm, b = 3.8 nm, γ = 93°. CymA does not form trimeric complexes in lipid membranes and shows no tendency to trimerize in solution.

CymA thus is an atypical porin with novel properties specialized to transfer cyclodextrins across the outer membrane. cyclodextrin octyl-polyoxyethylene dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine polymerase chain reaction Cyclodextrins (CDs)1 are cylindrically shaped oligosaccharides made up of six (α-CD), seven (β-CD), or eight (γ-CD) glucose units (1Szejtli J. Chem. Rev. 1998; 98: 1743-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (4376) Google Scholar). Since the hydroxyl groups border the outside of the ring, CDs are hydrophilic and readily soluble whereas the cavity of the cylinder is hydrophobic. CDs are formed from starch by several microorganisms via the action of cyclodextrin-glucanotransferases, which are secreted into the medium (2Schmid G. Atwood J.L. Davies J.E.D. MacNicol D.D. Vögtle F. Comprehensive Supramolecular Chemistry. 3. Elsevier, Oxford, United Kingdom1996: 615-626Google Scholar). The extracellular CDs can be utilized by the respective organisms as carbon and energy source. In the case of Klebsiella oxytoca, the utilization pathway has been studied in detail and it could be shown that the products of at least 10 genes, designated cymA to cymJ, are involved (3Fiedler G. Pajatsch M. Böck A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 279-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Four of them are constituents of a periplasmic binding protein-dependent uptake system (3Fiedler G. Pajatsch M. Böck A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 279-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), from which CymE is the binding protein (4Pajatsch M. Gerhart M. Peist R. Horlacher R. Boos W. Böck A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2630-2635Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), CymF and CymG are the integral membrane components, and CymD the ATPase. There is convincing evidence that α- and β-CDs are taken up as intact entities (3Fiedler G. Pajatsch M. Böck A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 279-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 4Pajatsch M. Gerhart M. Peist R. Horlacher R. Boos W. Böck A. J.

Kremmer E. Böck A. Arch. Microbiol. 1996; 165: 206-212PubMed Google Scholar). CymE, CymF, CymG, and CymD are homologs of the components of the paradigmatic maltose uptake system, MalE, MalF, MalG, and MalK, respectively (3Fiedler G. Pajatsch M. Böck A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 279-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 6Boos W. Peist R. Decker K. Zdych E. Lin E.C.C. Lynch A.S. Regulation of Gene Expression in Escherichia coli. R. G. Landes Co., Georgetown, TX1996: 201-229Crossref Google Scholar). The metabolism of γ-CDs is dependent on the activity of the cyclodextrin-glucanotransferase (3Fiedler G. Pajatsch M. Böck A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 279-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), so γ-CDs must be converted into α- or β-CDs or linearized (7Bender H. Carbohydr.

How the bulky molecules of α-CD and β-CD traverse the outer membrane was still unknown. Because of their outer diameter of 1.37 (α-CD) and 1.53 (β-CD) nm and their physical properties, it was a priori improbable that they use the LamB channel for entry into the periplasm. In this report, we show that α-CDs cross the outer membrane of K. oxytoca and also of recombinant Escherichia coli cells via a specific porin that has been identified as the product of the cymA gene. We demonstrate that this porin also accepts linear maltodextrins as passenger molecules. The purification of CymA and its intriguing properties are reported.

Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Enzymes for recombinant DNA techniques were used according to the recommendations of the manufacturers (Roche Molecular Biochemicals GmbH, Mannheim, Germany; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Freiburg, Germany; New England Biolabs, Schwalbach, Germany). The oligonucleotide primers used were synthesized by MWG (Ebersberg, Germany). Plasmid pCYMA2 is a pSU2719 derivative (12Martinez E. Bartolomé B. de la Cruz F. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 68: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) which carries a K. oxytoca DNA fragment starting 216 base pairs 5′ of cymA and extending to base pair 175 of cymB. For construction, pSU2719 was restricted with Sac I and Xba I, dephosphorylated, and ligated with the insert, which was prepared by analogous restriction of plasmid pCYMA (3Fiedler G. Pajatsch M. Böck A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 279-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The lamB gene of K. oxytoca was cloned via PCR using phosphorylated oligonucleotides derived from the nucleotide sequence of the homologous gene from Klebsiella pneumoniae (13Werts C. Charbit A. Bachellier S. Hofnung M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 233: 372-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide LAMB3 is a 24-mer (5′-ATGATGATTACTCTGCGCAAACTT-3′) and starts with the ATG of the reading frame, whereas the 27-mer oligonucleotide LAMB4 (5′-TTACCACCACACTTCCATCTGGGCACC-3′) starts with the codon complementary to the stop codon of lamB. The resulting PCR fragment was inserted into Sma I-restricted pSU2719 vector. The resulting plasmids were pLAMB carrying the insert fused to the lac promoter of the vector and pILAMB carrying the insert in the opposite direction. The K. oxytoca cymA deletion mutant was constructed as described in Pajatsch et al. (4Pajatsch M. Gerhart M. Peist R. Horlacher R. Boos W. Böck A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2630-2635Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for the K. oxytoca cymE deletion strain. The plasmid used for introducing the deletion was pCYMΔA (3Fiedler G. Pajatsch M. Böck A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 279-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). For overproduction and purification of CymA, strain JM109 (14Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11472) Google Scholar) was transformed with plasmid pCYMA. The transformants were grown aerobically at 37 °C overnight to an A600 of 1.2 to 1.7 in 6 × 2.5 liters of LB medium (10Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar), harvested by centrifugation, and stored at −80 °C. During purification, the protein concentration was assayed according to Whitaker and Granum (15Whitaker J.R. Granum P.E. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 109: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), and that of the purified CymA according to Bradford (16Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (217507) Google Scholar). The CymA content of the fractions was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207521) Google Scholar) following the distribution of the 39-kDa band of the mature form of CymA. Cells were suspended in 200 ml of buffer A (50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and broken by three passages through a French pressure cell at 16,000 p.s.i. The extract was clarified by centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 45 min, resulting in the S6 fraction. The membranes were pelleted by centrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 90 min, yielding the P100 fraction. For the solubilization of the cytoplasmic membrane components, the pellet was resuspended in 40 ml of buffer A containing 0.5% sarcosyl (Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany). After stirring for 45 min at room temperature, the solubilized material was removed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 90 min. The pellet was washed in buffer A, and the solubilization procedure was repeated resulting in fraction PCM. Remainders of sarcosyl were removed by washing the pellet twice in buffer A; the pellet was resuspended in buffer A containing 100 μg/ml lysozyme and 3 mmNaN3 and stirred overnight at 37 °C. After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 90 min, the outer membrane components were solubilized by resuspending the pellet in 40 ml of buffer B (50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, and 5% of octyl-polyoxyethylene (OPOE; Bachem Biochemica GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany); protein-detergent ratio 1:5). The solution was stirred for 1 h at room temperature and clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 90 min. The supernatant (fraction SOM) was dialyzed against buffer C (10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 0.6% OPOE) and loaded on a Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column (21-ml bed volume) that had been equilibrated in buffer C. The column was washed with 80 ml of buffer C, developed with a 200-ml linear gradient (0–0.6 mNaCl), and finally washed with 40 ml of buffer C and buffer C containing 1 m NaCl. The flow rate was 1 ml/min. Fractions containing CymA were concentrated by ultrafiltration (Centricon 50 concentrators, Amicon) and applied to a Superdex 200 HiLoad gel filtration column (60 cm × 16 mm) that had been equlibrated in buffer D (10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.6% OPOE). The column was eluted with buffer D at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. To remove most of the remaining impurities (mainly OmpC, OmpF, and OmpA), an ion-exchange chromatography through a Mono Q-HR 5/5 column (1-ml bed volume) was carried out. The column was equilibrated with buffer C, loaded with the sample, and rinsed with 25 ml of buffer C. It was developed with a 20-ml linear gradient (0–0.6 m NaCl) and consecutively washed with 10 ml of buffer C and buffer C containing 1 m NaCl. The fractions containing highly enriched CymA were concentrated by ultrafiltration, and the gel filtration chromatography with the Superdex 200 HiLoad gel filtration column was repeated. The fractions containing the purified CymA were concentrated by ultrafiltration to a concentration of 1 mg/ml, supplied with 3 mm NaN3, and stored at 4 °C. The N-terminal sequence of purified CymA was determined in an Applied Biosystems pulsed liquid-phase sequencer 477A equipped with an on-line phenylthiohydantoin-amino acid analyzer 120 A (Applied Biosystems). The secondary structure composition of CymA was estimated with spectra obtained by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy using the attenuated total reflection technique. Spectra were measured in a Nicolet FTIR 740 spectrometer at 2 cm−1 resolution. Samples containing 30–70 μg of protein were dried onto Germanium crystals. Spectra were collected by adding 1024 scans for each determination and transformed without apodization for further analysis. Hydrogen-deuterium (H-D) exchange was performed on the Ge crystals in a particularly constructed chamber by flushing the sample with N2/D2O at 25 °C. The exchange was monitored online by taking spectra (8 scans added) every 15 s to 5 min. After 30 min the exchange was apparently completed, and a final spectrum (1024 scans) was measured. The secondary composition was judged by comparing the CymA spectrum with spectra of porins and other reference proteins whose structures are known and by quantitative analysis of the amide I band as described in Ref. 18Byler D.M Susi H. Biopolymers. 1986; 25: 469-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (2739) Google Scholar. Two-dimensional crystallization was performed using the dialysis method and apparatus described by Paul et al. (19Paul A. Engelhardt H. Jakubowski U. Baumeister W. Biophys. J. 1992; 61: 172-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). CymA was dissolved in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer solution, pH 7.5, plus 250 mm NaCl, 0.6% OPOE, and 3 mm NaN3. The solution was supplemented with dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) solubilized in the same detergent such as to adjust protein-to-lipid ratios from 0.23 to 8.9 (w/w). The final volume was 200 μl, the final protein concentration 0.67–0.95 mg/ml, and the final OPOE content between 0.48% for the highest and 1.92% for the lowest protein-to-lipid ratio. A sample without protein served as a control for membrane formation, a sample without DMPC as a test for the capability of CymA to form crystals without additional lipid. The dialysis buffer consisted of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, plus 3 mm NaN3; the dialysis membrane had an exclusion cutoff of 15–20 kDa. Dialysis was performed at 33 ± 1 °C for 72 h at a buffer flow rate of 0.12 ml/min per dialysis chamber (200 μl). Membrane formation was monitored online by light diffraction (19Paul A. Engelhardt H. Jakubowski U. Baumeister W. Biophys. J. 1992; 61: 172-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and the experiment was ended when the diffraction curve had approached its plateau for at least 24 h. The samples were inspected in the light microscope and investigated by electron microscopy afterward. All samples were stored at 4 °C. Aliquots of 5 μl were applied to carbon-coated copper grids made hydrophilic by means of glow discharge. The grids were washed with pure water to remove buffer salts prior to negative staining with 2% unbuffered uranyl acetate solution. Electron micrographs were taken in a Philips EM420 at nominal magnification ×36,000. Micrographs were digitized with an Eikonix 1412 camera applying a pixel size of 0.43 nm at the specimen level. Image processing was performed with a Silicon Graphics workstation using the SEMPER 6.4 system (20Saxton W.O. Pitt T.J. Horner M. Ultramicroscopy. 1979; 4: 343-354Crossref Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 21Saxton W.O. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 230-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) for analyzing and averaging two-dimensional crystalline membranous structures via the correlation averaging approach (22Saxton W.O. Baumeister W. J. Microsc. 1982; 127: 127-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). Reference images for averaging were prepared by window filtering the Fourier transforms. Only the periodic information contained in the reflections systematically distributed on a lattice in Fourier space were selected. Subregions of the back-transformed images were used as references for correlation averaging (23Engelhardt H. Methods Microbiol. 1988; 20: 357-413Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The resolution was assessed by the radial correlation function criterion (22Saxton W.O. Baumeister W. J. Microsc. 1982; 127: 127-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). Black lipid bilayer membranes were formed as has been described previously (24Benz R. Janko K. Boos W. Läuger P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 511: 305-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar) from a 1% solution of diphytanoyl phosphatidylcholine (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) in n-decane. The instrumentation consisted of a Teflon chamber with two aqueous compartments connected by a small circular hole with a surface area of 0.3–0.5 mm2 across which the membranes were formed. The aqueous salt solutions (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) were used unbuffered and had a pH around 6, if not indicated otherwise. CymA was added from the concentrated stock solution to the aqueous phase bathing a membrane in the black state. The temperature was kept at 20 °C throughout. The membrane current was measured with a pair of Ag/AgCl electrodes with salt bridges switched in series with a voltage source and a current amplifier. The amplified signal was monitored with a storage oscilloscope, and the reconstitution of channels in the black lipid membrane was recorded with a strip chart recorder. The mechanism of solute transport through specific porins can be explained by a simple occupancy of a binding site in a two-barrier, one-site channel similar to the situation in certain single-file ion channels (25Benz R. Hancock R.E.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1987; 89: 275-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 26Benz R. Hakenbeck R. Ghuysen J.-M. Bacterial Cell Wall. Elsevier, Amsterdam, The Netherlands1994: 397-423Google Scholar). We used a similar approach here for the explanation of the binding of carbohydrates to the CymA channel. For this, it is assumed that CymA is a carbohydrate-specific single file channel similar to those formed by LamB of enteric bacteria (specific for maltose and maltooligosaccharides; Refs. 27Benz R. Schmid A. Nakae T. Vos-Scheperkeuter G.H. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 165: 978-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar and 28Luckey M. Nikaido H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 165-171Crossref Scopus (184) Google Scholar), ScrY (specific for sucrose; Refs. 29Andersen C. Cseh R. Schülein K. Benz R. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 164: 263-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar and 30Schülein K. Schmid K. Benz R. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 2233-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and Tsx (specific for nucleosides; Ref. 31Maier C. Bremer E. Schmid A. Benz R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2493-2499Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This means that it is open when no carbohydrate is bound, and closed when it is occupied by a carbohydrate. The probability, p, for the occupancy of the binding site by a carbohydrate is given by the Langmuir adsorption isotherm. The channel does not conduct ions with the probability, p.p=K·c/(K·c+1)Equation 1 K is the stability constant of the binding between substrate and the binding site (half-saturation constant KS), and c is its concentration in the aqueous phase on both sides of the channel. The probability that the binding site is free and conducts ions is given by 1 −p.1−p=1/(K·c+1)Equation 2 This means that the membrane conductance, G (c), as a function of the substrate concentration, c, in the aqueous phase is given by the following equation.G(c)=Gmax·1/(K·c+1)Equation 3 Gmax is the maximum membrane conductance without the substrate, i.e. when the binding site is free. According to the assumptions, only one carbohydrate can bind to the binding site at a given time and no ion can pass the channel when the binding site is occupied. This means that a carbohydrate can enter the channel only when the binding site is free. The model also assumes a symmetric channel in view of the location of the binding site inside the channel and its access from both sides. The sequence analysis of the products of the cym genes had indicated that three of them (CymA, CymC, and CymE) contain signal peptides (3Fiedler G. Pajatsch M. Böck A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 279-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). CymE has been identified as the cyclodextrin-binding protein in the periplasm (4Pajatsch M. Gerhart M. Peist R. Horlacher R. Boos W. Böck A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2630-2635Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and CymC was shown to be dispensable for the utilization of cyclodextrins as sole carbon source (3Fiedler G. Pajatsch M. Böck A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 279-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The only candidate left for the porin function, therefore, was CymA. Previous evidence for such a role was that an E. coli strain transformed with the 10 cym genes from K. oxytoca was able to grow at the expense of CDs but not when the cymA gene was deleted. In addition, the lamB gene from E. coli could not complement this deficiency (3Fiedler G. Pajatsch M. Böck A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 279-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). We also introduced an in-frame deletion into the chromosomal cymA gene from K. oxytoca (yielding strain CYMA). The mutant was not able to grow on CDs as sole carbon and energy source, but it was still able to grow on maltohexaose, indicating that lamB was functionally expressed. This was confirmed by cloning the lamB gene from K. oxytoca via PCR and by demonstrating that it could complement the lamB deficiency of an E. coli mutant to grow on maltohexaose (data not shown). It was further analyzed whether the presence of CymA is required solely for growth on CDs or whether it can also support utilization of maltodextrins. A lamB mutant from E. coli (strain GM7) was, therefore, transformed with plasmid pCYMA2 that expresses cymA. Table II shows that the presence of the cymA gene confers the capability to the lamB mutant to grow on maltodextrins with four or more glucose units. Growth on glucose, maltose, or maltotriose also occurred in the absence of the cymA gene since these substrates are taken up via alternative porins (32Nikaido H. Vaara M. Microbiol. Rev. 1985; 49: 1-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Wandersman C. Schwartz M. Ferenci T. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 140: 1-13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Table IIRequirement of CymA for growth on linear maltodextrinsStrainGenotypeCarbon sourceG1–3G4, 5G6G7MC4100/pSU2719lamB +++++++++++++GM7/pSU2719lamB −+++−−−GM7/pCYMA2lamB −, cymA ++++++++++G1, G2, G3, and G4–7 denote growth on glucose, maltose, maltotriose (each 0.5%), and maltotetraose to maltoheptaose (each 0.2%). +++, tD ∼ 1–2.5 h; ++, tD ∼ 3–4 h; +, tD ∼ 6–12 h; −, no growth for at least 48 h.

CymA was overproduced in E. coli JM109 transformed with plasmid pCYMA, and the protein was purified as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 1 displays the course of purification as analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis of the pooled fractions after each purification step. A symmetrical peak of highly enriched CymA was eluted from the last column; the yield was 5.5 mg of protein out of 15 liters of culture. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified protein was determined to be ASDQR, which confirms that the signal sequence has been cleaved off (Fig.2 A). An alignment of the sequence with those of porins with established structure and function did not reveal any conspicuous similarities. Inspection of the primary sequence using a previously proposed formalism (36Vogel H. Jähnig F. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 190: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) suggested that it contained possibilities for amphipathic β-strands, which is typical for outer membrane porins (37Weiss M.S. Kreusch A. Schiltz E. Nestel U. Welte W. Weckesser J. Schulz G.E. FEBS Lett. 1991; 280: 379-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) (data not shown). A clear β-sheet structure is also visible at the C terminus (Fig. 2 B), which contains the ultimate phenylalanine residue, which has been shown to be important for insertion of porins into the outer membrane (38Struyvé M. Moons M. Tommassen J. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). The consensus of the sequence -X-h-X-h-X-h-X-Y-X-F matches that of CymA. To determine the secondary structure composition of CymA by experimental means, infrared spectra of the native and deuterated protein (H-D exchange by exposure to D2O vapor) were measured. The shape of the amide I band (1700–1600 cm−1) of the CymA spectrum (Fig. 3) is very typical for outer membrane proteins, and porins in particular, which consist of 55–60% antiparallel β-sheet forming a β-barrel (36Vogel H. Jähnig F. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 190: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The prominent peak at 1628 cm−1 is indicative for a high content of β-strands (60 ± 5% of the total amino acids, analysis not shown) and the shoulder at 1693 cm−1 for β-turns, i.e. both together for antiparallel β-sheet. The loss of the underlying absorption band around 1655 cm−1 upon deuteration and its shift to wave numbers below 1650 cm−1 are indicative for loops and folds without preferred secondary structure characteristics (18Byler D.M Susi H. Biopolymers. 1986; 25: 469-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (2739) Google Scholar). The α-helix content is very small and is assessed to be less than 10%. The spectra of both solubilized protein and CymA reconstituted into DMPC membranes did not differ. The H-D-exchange was extremely rapid as judged by spectra taken at 10 s, 60 s, 120 s, and higher up to 30 min after turning on the N2/D2O stream (data not shown). In fact, the final spectrum of CymA embedded in lipid membranes (Fig. 3) is almost indistinguishable from the very first one in the time series, meaning that the loops were easily accessible to D2O and were not shielded by membrane lipids or buried inside the protein. A typical property of bacterial porins is the trimeric structure of high thermal stability (39Van Gelder P. de Cock H. Tommassen J. von Heijne G. Membrane Protein Assembly. R. G. Landes Co., Georgetown, TX1997: 63-82Google Scholar). Classical"

In the accompanying paper (Masaoka, A., Terato, H., Kobayashi, M., Honsho, A., Ohyama, Y., and Ide, H. (1999)J. Biol. Chem. 274, 25136–25143), it has been shown that fU correctly paired with A is recognized by AlkA protein (Escherichia coli 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase II). In the present work, mispairing frequency of fU with G and cellular repair protein that specifically recognized fU:G mispairs were studied using defined oligonucleotide substrates. Mispairing frequency of fU was determined by incorporation of 2′-deoxyribonucleoside 5′-triphosphate of fU opposite template G using DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment deficient in 3′-5′ exonuclease. Mispairing frequency of fU was dependent on the nearest neighbor base pair in the primer terminus and 2–12 times higher than that of thymine at pH 7.8 and 2.6–6.7 times higher at pH 9.0 with an exception of the nearest neighbor T(template):A(primer). AlkA catalyzed the excision of fU placed opposite G, as well as A, and the excision efficiencies of fU for fU:G and fU:A pairs were comparable. In addition, MutS protein involved in methyl-directed mismatch repair also recognized fU:G mispairs and bound them with an efficiency comparable to T:G mispairs, but it did not recognize fU:A pairs. Prior complex formation between MutS and a heteroduplex containing an fU:G mispair inhibited the activity of AlkA to fU. These results suggest that fU present in DNA can be restored by two independent repair pathways, i.e. the base excision repair pathway initiated by AlkA and the methyl-directed mismatch repair pathway initiated by MutS. Biological relevance of the present results is discussed in light of DNA replication and repair in cells. 5-Formyluracil (fU), a major methyl oxidation product of thymine, forms correct (fU:A) and incorrect (fU:G) base pairs during DNA replication.

Deamination of cytosine and adenine, for example, results in uracil and hypoxanthine, respectively, and changes their coding properties in an explicit manner because the deamination products can fully (uracil) or partly (hypoxanthine) adopt hydrogen bonding schemes of thymine and guanine, respectively. Abasic sites also result in mutation by an explicit mechanism due to the total loss of base pairing information at the sites. In contrast, some of DNA base lesions that seemingly retain intact coding regions have mutagenic potential. 7,8-Dihydro-8-oxoguanine is one of the best studied examples for this type of lesions. In this lesion, the functional groups in the pyrimidine unit responsible for canonical hydrogen bond formation remain intact, but oxidation of the imidazole unit (C-8) tends to shift the anti-syn equilibrium of the base conformation so that 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine in syn conformation forms a mispair with adenine during DNA replication (1Kouchhakdjian M.

Similarly, we have previously shown that 5-formyluracil (fU)1 retaining an apparently intact coding region forms a mispair with guanine, as well as a correct pair with adenine (4Yoshida M. Makino K. Morita H. Terato H. Ohyama Y. Ide H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1570-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The mispairing frequency of fU with guanine is significantly higher than that of parent thymine, and the decreased p Ka of fU relative to thymine is responsible for the mispairing. Thus, alterations of a part of a base structure that is not directly involved in base pairing can affect anti-syn (ex. 7, 8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine) or acid-base (fU) equilibria, thereby leading to mutation in an implicit manner.

Chem. 1999; 274: 25136-25143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), we have shown that fU paired with adenine is recognized by Escherichia coli 3-methyladenine glycosylase II (AlkA) and excised from DNA. In the present work, we quantitatively evaluated the mispairing frequency of fU based on the misincorporation of the deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate of fU (fdUTP) and then searched for cellular repair systems that recognize an fU:G mispair site-specifically introduced into oligonucleotide substrates. We report here that the mispairing frequency of fU with G is nearest neighbor base-dependent and that fU:G mispairs are specifically recognized by two repair proteins, i.e. AlkA (3-methyladenine glycosylase II) and MutS, which are involved in the base excision and methyl-directed mismatch repair pathways, respectively. Ultra-pure dNTPs were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. 5-Formyl-2′-deoxyuridine (fdU) and 5-formyl-2′-deoxyuridine 5′-triphosphate (fdUTP) were synthesized and purified as described (4Yoshida M. Makino K. Morita H. Terato H. Ohyama Y. Ide H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1570-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). T4 polynucleotide kinase and E. coli DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment deficient in 3′-5′ exo nuclease (Pol I Kf (exo−)) were obtained from Toyobo and New England Biolabs, respectively. Alkali phosphatase and cloned MutS protein was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals and Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, respectively. Cloned AlkA and endonuclease IV were prepared as described in the accompanying paper (5Masaoka A. Terato H. Kobayashi M. Honsho A. Ohyama Y. Ide H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25136-25143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Templates and primers for DNA polymerase reactions (Table I) were synthesized by the standard phosphoramidite method and purified by reversed phase HPLC. 25T and 25FU containing thymine and fU at the same position, respectively, were prepared by DNA polymerase reactions using template/primer 30A/P1 as described in the accompanying paper (5Masaoka A.

Okagami M. Murayama H. Kimura Y. Makino K. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1993; 31: 485-491PubMed Google Scholar). The amounts of the recovered oligonucleotides were calculated from the specific radioactivity of the primer P1 used in the polymerase reaction.Table IList of oligonucleotides used in this studyAbbreviationSequence1-aF = fU.27TA3′-TGGGTCAGTGCTTACCTAGTTGCTAGC27TG3′-TGGGTCAGTGCTTGCCTAGTTGCTAGC27AG3′-TGGGTCAGTGCTAGCCTAGTTGCTAGC27CG3′-TGGGTCAGTGCTCGCCTAGTTGCTAGC27GG3′-TGGGTCAGTGCTGGCCTAGTTGCTAGC13A5′-ACCCAGTCACGAA13T5′-ACCCAGTCACGAT13G5′-ACCCAGTCACGAG13C5′-ACCCAGTCACGAC25T5′-CATCGATAGCATCCGTCACAGGCAG25FU5′-CATCGATAGCATCCGFCACAGGCAG30A3′-AAGTCGTAGCTATCGTAGGCAGTGTCCGTC30G3′-AAGTCGTAGCTATCGTAGGCGGTGTCCGTCP15′-CATCGATAGCATCCG1-a F = fU. Open table in a new tab Primers (13A, 13G, 13C, and 13T, Table I) were 5′-end labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (110 TBq/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and T4 polynucleotide kinase, and purified as described (6Ide H. Okagami M. Murayama H. Kimura Y. Makino K. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1993; 31: 485-491PubMed Google Scholar). The primers were annealed to appropriate templates, and template/primer (0.3 pmol) was incubated with Pol I Kf (exo−) (0.012 unit) and dNTP (fdUTP, dTTP or dCTP) in Buffer A (6 μl) at 25 °C. Buffer A consisted of 66 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8 or 9.0), 1.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 6.6 mm MgCl2. Appropriate ranges of dNTP concentration and incubation time were determined in preliminary experiments, then the parameters were measured using these ranges (see below). The percentage of the extended primer was generally less than 30% under these conditions. For the correct incorporation (i.e. fdUTP and dTTP opposite template A, dCTP opposite template G), the dNTP concentration range was typically 0.025–2 μm, and incubation time was 3 min. For the incorrect incorporation (i.e. fdUTP and dTTP opposite template G), they were typically 10–1000 μm and 10–30 min under these conditions. After incubation, the reaction was terminated by the addition of gel loading buffer consisted of 0.05% xylene cyanol, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 20 mm EDTA, and 98% formamide. The sample was separated by 16% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions. In the gel electrophoresis, TPE (90 mm Tris-phosphate and 2 mm EDTA, pH 6.6) buffer was used in stead of TBE (90 mm Tris borate and 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.2) because electrophoresis of the reaction products containing 3′-terminal fU in TBE resulted in smearing of the band (data not shown), probably due to the acid-base equilibrium of the fU moiety (p Ka = 8.6) (4Yoshida M. Makino K. Morita H. Terato H. Ohyama Y. Ide H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1570-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 7Privat E.J. Sowers L.C. Mutat. Res. 1996; 354: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The smearing of the band could be minimized by electrophoresis in TPE buffer. After electrophoresis, the radioactivity of the extended and unextended primer was quantitated by Fuji BAS 2000. Kinetic parameters for incorporation of dNTP were calculated from Lineweaver-Burk plots. Duplex oligonucleotide substrates 25FU/30A and 25FU/30G (Table I) were incubated with AlkA protein in Buffer B (typically 25 μl) at 37 °C for 30 min. Buffer B for AlkA reactions consisted of 70 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.8), 1 mmEDTA, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. The substrate concentration and the amount of AlkA used in the reaction are indicated in the figure legends. After incubation, DNA was purified by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. The purified DNA was incubated with endonuclease IV (4 ng) at 37 °C for 30 min in Buffer C (10 μl), mixed with gel loading buffer, and finally subjected to gel electrophoresis. Buffer C was composed of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mmNaCl, and 1 mm EDTA. 25FU/30A and 25FU/30G were also treated with AlkA in the presence of MutS protein to elucidate the effect of competitive action of these proteins on the substrates. The substrates (2 nm) were preincubated with MutS protein (0.049–0.39 μg, approximately 0.5–4 pmol) in Buffer B (9 μl) at 0 °C for 10 min, and then AlkA (10 ng) diluted in Buffer B (1 μl) was added to the reaction mixture. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. Product analysis was performed as described above. The binding of MutS protein to oligonucleotide duplexes was analyzed by the gel electrophoretic mobility shift assay as described by Jiricny et al. (8Jiricny J. Su S.-S. Wood S.G. Modrich P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7843-7853Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Binding reactions were performed by mixing 3 μl of 5′-labeled oligonucleotide duplexes (25FU/30A, 25FU/30G, 25T/30A, and 25T/30G, 0.1 pmol, Table I) in Buffer D with 2 μl of MutS protein (0.2–0.82 μg, approximately 2.1–8.4 pmol) appropriately diluted in Buffer E. The composition of Buffer D was 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and that of Buffer E was 50 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.2), 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 50% glycerol. The reaction mixture was incubated on ice for 30 min and then supplemented with 2 μl 50% sucrose. Samples (2 μl) were loaded onto a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresed in TBE buffer at 4 °C. Gels were dried and autoradiographed at −80 °C. Free and bound DNA species were quantitated by Fuji BAS 2000. E. coli AB1157 cells were grown at 37 °C in M9 medium supplemented with 0.4% glucose, 0.5% casamino acids (Difco), 2 mm MgSO4, 0.1 mmCaCl2. At an absorbance of 0.6, cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (125 volume of the original culture). Hydrogen peroxide was added to the cell suspension (final concentrations, 20 and 40 mm), and the suspension was kept at 37 °C for 1 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 4 °C, and washed by cold phosphate-buffered saline twice, and resuspended in lysis buffer (3 volumes of the cell pellet) containing 150 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm EDTA, and lysozyme (final concentration, 1 mg/ml). Cells were lysed by repeated freeze-thaw cycles. The lysis solution was mixed with 3 volumes of cold 5% trichloroacetic acid, mixed vigorously, and clarified by centrifugation. The supernatant was taken and extracted by 2 volumes of trioctylamine/1,1,1-trichloroethane (1:4 v/v) to remove trichloroacetic acid (9Hartwick R.A. Brown P.R. J. Chromatogr. 1977; 143: 383-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The water phase (400 μl) was passed through a C18 Sep-Pak cartridge light (Waters). An aliquot of the flow-through fraction (100 μl) containing nucleotides was mixed with 5 μl of 500 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), 80 mm MgCl2, and alkali phosphatase (6 units) and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The sample was filtered with an ultrafiltration filter (molecular weight cut, approximately 10,000) and the filtrate was subjected to HPLC analysis. Alternatively, the filtered sample (100 μl) was mixed with 100 mm cysteamine (5 μl) for derivatization to a thiazolidine derivative (10Terato H. Morita H. Ohyama Y. Ide H. Nucleosides Nucleotides. 1998; 17: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), left at room temperature for 8 h, and analyzed by HPLC. The HPLC system consisted of Jasco Model PU-980 pumps, a Hitachi Modell-4200H UV-VIS detector, a Hitachi model D-2500 integrator, and a column oven (40 °C). The nucleosides resulting from alkali phosphatase digestion were separated on a C18 WS-DNA column (0.46 × 15 cm, Wako) using a linear methanol gradient in 10 mmphosphate buffer (pH 7.4): 0% methanol (0–5 min), 0–20% (5–35 min). The flow rate was 0.8 ml/min. The monitoring wavelength was 280 nm (λmax of 5-formyl-2′-deoxyuridine (fdU)) and 265 nm (λmax of the thiazolidine derivative) for the samples without and with the derivatization, respectively. To determine the recovery efficiency, the extraction procedure was performed on a standard sample containing authentic fdUTP and dTTP. In our previous study, it was shown that fdUTP efficiently substitutes for dTTP and to the less extent for dCTP, indicating that fU forms a mispair with guanine as well as a correct pair with adenine (4Yoshida M. Makino K. Morita H. Terato H. Ohyama Y. Ide H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1570-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To clarify more quantitative aspects of correct and incorrect base pairing capabilities of fU, steady state kinetic parameters for incorporation of fdUTP were determined using a set of defined template and primer. For correct incorporation, template/primer 27TA/13A (TableI) was incubated with Pol I Kf (exo−) in the presence of varying concentrations of fdUTP or dTTP, and initial velocities of their incorporation opposite template A were measured by gel electrophoresis. Parameters (Vmax and Km) were determined at pH 7.8 and 9.0 to elucidate the effects of the acid-base equilibrium of the base unit of fdUTP. The p Ka values of the base units of fdUTP and dTTP are 8.6 and 10.0, respectively (4Yoshida M. Makino K. Morita H. Terato H. Ohyama Y. Ide H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1570-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 7Privat E.J. Sowers L.C. Mutat. Res. 1996; 354: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The ratio of the correct incorporation efficiencies (f =Vmax/Km) for fdUTP and dTTP were approximately ½ (0.52/1) at pH 7.8 and ¼ (0.06/0.23) at pH 9.0 (Table II), indicating that fU retained the base pairing capability similar to parent thymine but with somewhat reduced efficiencies. At pH 9.0, ionization of the base unit of fdUTP (p Ka = 8.6) led to a notable increase in Km (= 1.64 μm) relative to that at pH 7.8 (Km = 0.12). Consequently, the incorporation efficiency was reduced significantly (f = 0.06), although the deviation from the optimum pH for the DNA polymerase appeared to be an additional factor as judged from the moderate decrease in the f value for dTTP: f = 1 (pH 7.8) and 0.23 (pH 9.0).Table IIKinetic parameters (Vmax and Km) and frequencies (f) of correct incorporation of fdUTP and dTTP opposite template adenineTemplate/primer2-aDNA polymerase reactions were performed using template/primer 27TA/13A.dNTPVmaxKmVmax/Kmf 2-bRelative values of Vmax/Km.%/min2-cPercentage of extended primer per min.μm%/min/μmpH 7.8 3′-TA-dTTP6.40.051281.00 5′-AfdUTP8.00.12670.52pH 9.0 3′-TA-dTTP6.00.2300.23 5′-AfdUTP12.01.647.30.062-a DNA polymerase reactions were performed using template/primer 27TA/13A.2-b Relative values of Vmax/Km.2-c Percentage of extended primer per min. Open table in a new tab Mispairing capabilities of fU were studied based on the incorporation of fdUTP opposite template guanine. A set of template and primer containing all four possible nearest neighbor base pairs at the primer terminus (27TG/13A, 27AG/13T, 27CG/13G, and 27GG/13C, Table I) was used to elucidate their effects on the mispairing frequency. The parameters are summarized in Table III along with those for dTTP and dCTP. The mispairing frequencies (f) of fU were lower than the correct paring frequency of C by factors of 104-105 at pH 7.8 and 103-104 at pH 9.0. The major discrimination factor was the large increase in Km(102-104-fold), and the contribution of the reduction of Vmax was relatively minor (at most by a factor of 10). To compare mispairing frequencies of fdUTP and dTTP more clearly, f values in Table III were plotted against the nearest neighbor pairs in Fig. 1. Mispairing frequencies were clearly nearest neighbor-dependent and pH-dependent for both fdUTP and dTTP, and they were consistently higher for fdUTP than dTTP except the T(template):A(primer) pair (see also Fig.2). The mispairing frequency increased with the pH shift from 7.8 to 9.0 for both fdUTP and dTTP. In this pH range, the dominant form of the base unit of fdUTP changes from the keto to enolate (ionized) form due to the acid-base equilibrium of the fU moiety (p Ka = 8.6). The enolate form of fU forms a base pair with guanine possibly through two hydrogen bonds (4Yoshida M. Makino K. Morita H. Terato H. Ohyama Y. Ide H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1570-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Likewise, partial ionization of the thymine moiety in dTTP (p Ka = 10) at pH 9.0 resulted in the increased mispairing frequencies in comparison with those at pH 7.8. Relative mispairing frequencies of fdUTP versus dTTP (f(fdUTP)/f(dTTP)) are shown in Fig. 2. With an exception for the T(template):A(primer) pair, the mispairing frequencies of fdUTP was 2–12-fold higher than those of dTTP at pH 7.8 and 2.6–6.7-fold higher at pH 9.0. These results suggest that the mutagenic effect associated with fU is sequence context-dependent.Table IIIKinetic parameters (Vmax and Km) and frequencies (f) of incorrect incorporation of fdUTP and dTTP opposite template guanineTemplate/primer3-aDNA polymerase reactions were performed using template/primer 27TG/13A, 27AG/13T, 27CG/13G, and 27GG/13C for the nearest neighbors T:A (template:primer), A:T, C:G, and G:C, respectively.dNTPVmaxKmVmax/Kmf 3-bRelative values of Vmax/Km.%/min3-cPercentage of extended primer per min.μm%/min/μmpH 7.8 3′-TG-dCTP5.30.041331.003-dCorrect incorporation. 5′-AdTTP0.871505.8 × 10−34.4 × 10−5fdUTP0.701813.9 × 10−32.9 × 10−5 3′-AG-dTTP0.655501.2 × 10−39.0 × 10−6 5′-TfdUTP0.702103.3 × 10−32.5 × 10−5 3′-CG-dTTP0.32953.4 × 10−32.6 × 10−5 5′-GfdUTP0.771107.0 × 10−35.3 × 10−5 3′-GG-dTTP0.42904.7 × 10−33.5 × 10−5 5′-CfdUTP1.4255.6 × 10−24.2 × 10−4pH 9.0 3′-TG-dTTP2.92261.3 × 10−29.8 × 10−5 5′-AfdUTP1.62267.1 × 10−35.3 × 10−5 3′-AG-dTTP3.52401.5 × 10−21.1 × 10−4 5′-TfdUTP6.01603.8 × 10−22.9 × 10−4 3′-CG-dTTP1.31241.0 × 10−27.5 × 10−5 5′-GfdUTP0.73116.6 × 10−25.0 × 10−4 3′-GG-dTTP2.0375.4 × 10−24.1 × 10−4 5′-CfdUTP3.1122.6 × 10−12.0 × 10−33-a DNA polymerase reactions were performed using template/primer 27TG/13A, 27AG/13T, 27CG/13G, and 27GG/13C for the nearest neighbors T:A (template:primer), A:T, C:G, and G:C, respectively.3-b Relative values of Vmax/Km.3-c Percentage of extended primer per min.3-d Correct incorporation.

Makino K. Morita H. Terato H. Ohyama Y. Ide H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1570-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholarand this work), although the frequency of the fU:G formation was much low compared with that of fU:A formation. Because oxidation of thymine to fU in intracellular dTTP or DNA can lead to increased mutation via the fU:G intermediate, this mispair needs to be corrected before the progression to the subsequent round of DNA replication. Thus, the substrate containing an fU:G mispair was tested for E. coli 3-methyladenine glycosylase II (AlkA) that was shown to recognize correct fU:A pairs and remove fU from DNA in the accompanying paper (5Masaoka A. Terato H. Kobayashi M. Honsho A. Ohyama Y. Ide H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25136-25143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Substrates containing an fU:G mispair (25FU/30G, Table I) and an fU:A pair (25FU/30A) were incubated with AlkA, followed by endonuclease IV to cleave abasic sites generated by the N-glycosylase activity of AlkA. Products were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Fig. 3 A shows typical results of the product analysis. AlkA recognized fU placed opposite G (lane 6) as well as A (lane 3), so that products incised at the lesion were observed for both substrates containing fU:G and fU:A pairs. To compare the activity of AlkA for fU:A and fU:G pairs quantitatively, similar reactions were performed with different concentrations of the substrates or different amounts of AlkA. 25FU/30A and 25FU/30G were equally incised at the 0.2 and 10 nm substrate concentrations (Fig. 3 B). In addition, the yields of nicked products for fU:A and fU:G pairs were essentially similar with varying amounts of AlkA and increased in parallel with the amount of AlkA (Fig.4). These results clearly indicate that fU:G and fU:A pairs are recognized by AlkA with comparable efficiencies.Figure 4Correlation between the amounts of AlkA and reaction products for fU :A and fU :G pairs. A, product analysis by gel electrophoresis. 25FU/30A (lanes 1–5) and 25FU/30G (lanes 6–10) all in 20 nm were treated with varying amounts of AlkA and products were separated as described in Fig. 3 A. The amount of AlkA was 1.55 ng (lanes 1 and 6), 3.1 ng (lanes 2 and 7), 6.2 ng (lanes 3 and 8), 9.3 ng (lanes 4 and 9), and 15.5 ng (lanes 5 and 10).

These postreplication mismatch repair pathways are initiated by binding of MutS or its homologues to mispaired bases. Thus, binding of MutS protein to an fU:G mispair was examined using a gel electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Fig.5 shows the result when homoduplexes (25FU/30A, 25T/30A) and heteroduplexes (25FU/30G, 25T/30G) were incubated with MutS. Shifted bands were observed for 25FU/30G (lane 4) and 25T/30G (lane 8), containing fU:G and T:G mispairs, respectively, but not for 25FU/30A (lane 2) and 25T/30A (lane 6), containing correct fU:A and T:A pairs, respectively. To compare the binding affinities of MutS to the mispaired substrates, the concentration of MutS protein was varied in the assay and the fraction of the bound substrates was determined by quantitating free and bound DNA species (Fig.6). The amounts of MutS required for 50% binding for T:G and fU:G mispairs were virtually similar (5.1 and 5.7 pmol, respectively) These values are also translated into approximately 1 μm as a MutS concentration. Accordingly, despite the difference in the C5 substituents of the bases, MutS binds to fU:G and T:G mispairs with comparable affinities.Figure 6Binding efficiency of MutS to fU :G and T:G mispairs. Gel electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed as described in Fig. 4 using the heteroduplexes 25FU/30G (fU:G) and 25T/30G (T:G) and varying amounts of MutS protein.

Possible consequences of the coexistence of the two proteins in the repair of fU were investigated. 25FU/30G and 25FU/30A were preincubated with varying amounts of MutS, then treated with AlkA. The repair efficiency of AlkA to homoduplex 25FU/30A was slightly enhanced by the addition of MutS (Fig.7). The enhancement was dependent on the amount of MutS and reached a plateau with an approximately 1.8-fold increase in the repair efficiency. A similar enhancement was observed by the addition of bovine serum albumin in place for MutS protein (data not shown), implying that general (or nonspecific) protein-protein interactions resulted in stabilization of the AlkA activity during the assay. In contrast to the homoduplex, the repair activity of AlkA for the heteroduplex (25FU/30G) was notably inhibited by the presence of MutS. The repair activity of AlkA was inhibited by 50% with approximately 2 pmol of MutS (or 0.2 μm as a MutS protein concentration) and further decreased by the addition of more MutS.

The subsequent addition of 100 μm ATP activated an inwardly rectifying K+current, without increasing [Ca2+]i. The K+ current was also stimulated by ATP in cells treated with thapsigargin in a Ca2+-free medium and was blocked by glibenclamide and tolbutamide, but not by charybdotoxin. This suggests the involvement of a Ca2+-independent, sulfonylurea-sensitive K+ channel (KATP). UTP mimicked the low [ATP] effects, while benzoyl-ATP activated internal Ca2+ release, a Ca2+ influx pathway, and KCa. Thus, ATP acts via P2U (P2Y2) and P2Z (P2X7) receptors to increase [Ca2+]i and activate KCa, but not KATP. Importantly, (i) ROMK1 and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator protein (but not SUR1, SUR2A, or SUR2B) and (ii) cAMP-stimulated Cl− and K+ currents were detected in HSG cells. These data demonstrate for the first time that a ROMK-type KATP channel is present in salivary gland duct cells that is regulated by extracellular ATP and possibly by the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator. This reveals a potentially novel mechanism for K+ secretion in these cells. [Ca2+]i and membrane current were measured in human submandibular gland ductal (HSG) cells to determine the regulation of salivary cell function by ATP. 1–10 μm ATP activated internal Ca2+ release, outward Ca2+-dependent K+ channel (KCa), and inward store-operated Ca2+ current (ISOC).

UTP mimicked the low [ATP] effects, while benzoyl-ATP activated internal Ca2+ release, a Ca2+ influx pathway, and KCa. Thus, ATP acts via P2U (P2Y2) and P2Z (P2X7) receptors to increase [Ca2+]i and activate KCa, but not KATP. Importantly, (i) ROMK1 and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator protein (but not SUR1, SUR2A, or SUR2B) and (ii) cAMP-stimulated Cl− and K+ currents were detected in HSG cells. These data demonstrate for the first time that a ROMK-type KATP channel is present in salivary gland duct cells that is regulated by extracellular ATP and possibly by the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator. This reveals a potentially novel mechanism for K+ secretion in these cells.

Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 1127-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Pharmacological studies with various ATP analogues have demonstrated two major groups of purinergic (P2) receptors: ionotropic receptors (P2X), associated with ligand-gated nonselective cation channel activity, and metabotropic receptors (P2Y), associated with activation of G-proteins (2Burnstock G. King B.F. Drug Dev. Res. 1996; 38: 67-71Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 3Dubyak G.R. El-Moatassim C. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C577-C606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Motte S. Communi D.

Nephrol. 1998; 6: 200-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In nonexcitable cells, extracellular ATP induces an elevation of cytosolic [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]i) by two distinct mechanisms, either by activation of Ca2+ release from intracellular Ca2+ stores or via activation of Ca2+ influx from the external medium (5Chan C.M. Unwin R.J. Burnstock G. Exp. Nephrol. 1998; 6: 200-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 6Turner J.T. Landon L.A. Gibbons S.J. Talamo B.R. Crit Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The P2Y subtype is coupled via Gαq/11 to the activation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate-specific phospholipase C. Thus, activation of these receptors by ATP leads to an increase in [Ca2+]idue to increase in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)1 and IP3-mediated internal Ca2+ release. Activation of the P2X subtype has been shown to be coupled to the activation of a nonspecific cation channel(s), resulting in increased permeability of the plasma membrane to Na+, K+, and Ca2+. P2 receptors have been found in many epithelial cells, including those from various salivary glands. Four P2 receptors have been identified in salivary gland cells: P2Y1, P2Y2(P2U), P2X4, and P2X7(P2Z) (6Turner J.T. Landon L.A. Gibbons S.J. Talamo B.R. Crit Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). In rat parotid acinar cells, it has been reported that ATP primarily activates a Ca2+ and Na+-permeable cation channel via stimulation of P2Z receptors. While transcripts for P2Y receptors have been detected in rat parotid acinar cells, ATP does not appear to strongly induce IP3 generation or internal Ca2+release (6Turner J.T. Landon L.A.

Interestingly, these P2-purinergic receptors have distinct cellular localizations in these cells; P2Zreceptors were found in the luminal membrane, while P2Ureceptors were detected in basolateral membrane (10Zeng W.

Presently, the exact mechanisms and ion channels involved in P2 receptor-mediated regulation of salivary gland function are poorly understood (6Turner J.T. Landon L.A. Gibbons S.J. Talamo B.R. Crit Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The human submandibular ductal cell line (HSG) has been widely used to study the mechanism(s) of Ca2+ signaling in salivary gland cells (6Turner J.T. Landon L.A. Gibbons S.J. Talamo B.R. Crit Rev.

Biol. 1990; 115: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Previous studies with HSG cells have demonstrated that activation of the muscarinic receptor leads to the generation of IP3, which causes intracellular Ca2+ release and activation of store-operated Ca2+ influx (15Izutsu K.T. Fatherazi S. Wellner R.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C58-C66Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Liu X. Rojas S.E. Ambudkar I.S. Am. J.

Biol. 1990; 115: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). HSG cells have also been reported to have P2 receptors (6Turner J.T. Landon L.A. Gibbons S.J. Talamo B.R. Crit Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 14Yu H. Turner J.T. J. Pharmacol. Exper. Ther. 1991; 259: 1344-1350PubMed Google Scholar). ATP, via the P2U receptor, was shown to increase [Ca2+]i and Ca2+-activated86Rb+ efflux (14Yu H. Turner J.T. J. Pharmacol. Exper. Ther. 1991; 259: 1344-1350PubMed Google Scholar). It was also reported that in HSG cells ATP-stimulated IP3 formation is coupled to the P2U activation, while ATP-stimulated45Ca2+ influx is mediated via activation of P2X receptors (19Kurihara K. Nakanishi N. Ueha T. Arch. Oral Biol. 1997; 42: 547-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). However, the types of ion channels involved in these ATP-induced ion fluxes have not yet been identified. This study examines the mechanisms involved in the regulation of salivary gland cell function by ATP, by measuring [Ca2+]i and the membrane conductance of HSG cells. The data show that ATP acts via multiple P2purinergic receptors, including P2U (P2Y2) and P2Z (P2X7), to activate the Ca2+-activated K+ channel (KCa), the store-operated Ca2+ influx channel, and probably a Ca2+-permeable cation channel. Importantly, we report here that ATP also activates an inwardly rectifying, Ca2+-independent K+ current. The inhibition of this current by sulfonylurea compounds and the presence of ROMK1 and cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) proteins in HSG cells, suggests for the first time that a ROMK type of epithelial KATP channel is present in salivary gland epithelial cells. As has been suggested for kidney epithelial cells (20Ho K. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 1998; 7: 49-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 21Schwiebert E.M. Benos D.J. Egan M.E. Stutts M.J. Guggino W.B. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79 (suppl.): 145-161Crossref Scopus (379) Google Scholar), the putative ROMK channel in HSG cells might also be regulated by a CFTR-dependent mechanism. These data reveal a potentially novel mechanism for the regulation of K+ secretion in salivary epithelial cells. HSG cells were a kind gift from Dr. Mitsunabo Sato (Tokushima University, Japan). The conditions for cell culture were similar to those described previously (16Liu X. Rojas S.E. Ambudkar I.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C571-C580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Liu X. O'Connell A. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33295-33304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown in Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (all from Biofluids, Rockville, MD) under 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were passaged when confluent by detaching from the tissue culture dish with 0.25% trypsin, 1.0 mm EDTA (Biofluids). A single-cell suspension was reseeded onto coverslips and used after about 24 h. Patch clamp in a whole cell configuration was performed on single HSG cells attached to coverslips using the standard patch-clamp technique described previously (16Liu X. Rojas S.E. Ambudkar I.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C571-C580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Liu X. O'Connell A. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33295-33304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The resistance of the pipette was about 3–6 megaohms. The chamber was connected with an Ag-AgCl pellet through a 150 mmNaCl-containing agar bridge. Membrane currents were measured with an Axopatch 200A amplifier in conjunction with pClamp 6.1 software and a Digidata 1200 A/D converter (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). The currents were filtered at 2 kHz (low pass bessel filter) and sampled with an interval of 10 ms. In the step protocol, the cell was held at 0 mV for 312 ms and stepped from −120 to −80 mV in 20-mV steps for 200 ms each step. The leakage subtraction function was used to minimize the leak currents. The currents were digitized and recorded directly onto the hard drive of a Dell Pentium computer. The I-V relationship was calculated using the peak amplitude of the current during the step protocol and exported to Origin 5 (Microcal Software, Inc., Northampton, MA) for further analysis. A piece of coverslip (0.5 × 0.5 mm) with cells was placed in the perfusion chamber (Warner Instrument Corporation, Hamden, Connecticut). For measuring KCa, the standard extracellular solution contained 145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, 0.2 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. The pipette was filled with 150 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2. For measuring Isoc, the extracellular solution contained 135 mm sodium glutamate, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 (NaOH). The pipette was filled with 135 mm NMDG-glutamate, 10 mm CsCl, 10 mm1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N, N, N′, N′-tetraacetic acid, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2 (CsOH). Any changes in the composition of the pipette and external solutions are given under “Results.” ATP, ATP analogs, thapsigargin (Tg), or CCh was included in the perfusion medium. Fluorescence was measured in fura2-loaded single HSG cells at excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm, with emission at 510 nm, using a SLM 8000/DMX 100 spectrofluorimeter attached to an inverted Nikon Diaphot inverted microscope with a Fluor 40× oil immersion objective. Images were acquired using an enhanced CCD camera (CCD-72, MTI) and the Image-1 software (Universal Imaging Corporation, PA). The 340/380-nm ratio of fura2 fluorescence has been used to represent [Ca2+]i. Other details of the experiments are given in the text and figure legends. All experiments were performed at room temperature. Preparation of crude and plasma membrane fractions, SDS-PAGE, and Western blotting were performed as described previously (22Wang W. O'Connell B. Dykeman R. Sakai T. Delporte C. Swaim W. Zhu X. Birnbaumer L. Ambudkar I.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C969-C979Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reactivity of the samples against either a polyclonal anti-human CFTR antibody, 1:150 dilution (a generous gift from Dr. W. Guggino, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD) or polyclonal anti-ROMK antibody, 1:200 dilution (Alomone Laboratories, Jerusalem, Israel) was determined using a secondary antibody 1:5000 dilution and ECL reagent (Amersham Life Sciences). Plasma membrane fraction from HEK-293 cells overexpressing the CFTR protein was kindly provided by Dr. Nelson Arispe (Department of Cell Biology, Uniformed Services University of Health Sciences, Bethesda, MD). Control ROMK1 protein was supplied by Alomone Laboratories. Amido Black B was used to stain the proteins after transfer to the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. mRNA was isolated from HSG cells using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) and the Oligotex mRNA kit (Qiagen). The RNA was treated with DNase I (amplification grade, Life Technologies, Inc.) at a concentration of 1 unit/μg of RNA. Human pancreatic mRNA was purchased fromCLONTECH. First strand cDNA synthesis of ROMK, SUR1, SUR2A, and SUR2B was carried out using 0.5 μg of mRNA using antisense-specific primers as follows: ROMK (5′-GGAGCTTTAGAGACTTTGCTTTAC), SUR1 (5′-CTCAAGGATGGCACCCCGCTTCAGG), SUR2A (5′-CTGAGGGTATTTTAGTGGAGTGTG), and SUR2B (5′- CACACTATTCTGACGGCAGACCTGG). The sense primers used for RT-PCR were as follows: ROMK (5′-CAGGGTGTTGACAGAAAGTATGTTC), SUR1 (5′-GCCCTGGCCGTCATCTCCTATGTC), and SUR2A and -2B (5′-CCAACCTTGGAATCTCTAACTCGC). RT-PCR was performed using SuperScript reverse transcriptase II (Life Technologies, Inc.). The PCR mixture contained 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, a 0.2 mm concentration of each dNTP, 20 pmol of each primer, first strand cDNA, and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase. PCR was performed as follows for 35 cycles: 94 °C denaturation for 30 s, 55 °C annealing for 45 s, and 68 °C extension for 2 min. 10% of the sulfonylurea receptor (SUR) products and 5% of the ROMK product were loaded on a 1% agarose gel. ATP, at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 100 μm, was added sequentially to the cell as shown in Fig. 1. An outward current was detected in 95% (43/48) of the HSG cells tested at a holding potential of 0 mV in a whole cell patch clamp mode. Typically, the cells showed a response, i.e. an increase in the outward current, at 1 μm ATP with a few cells responding at 0.1 or 10 μm. A second response was seen at 100 μmATP. However, a subsequent addition of 1 mm or higher ATP failed to induce any further increase in the membrane current. The current was blocked by replacing intracellular K+ with Cs+ (data not shown), strongly indicating that it was due to an increase in K+ ion conductance. Further, this pattern of response was similar in the presence or absence of external Ca2+ (Fig. 1, compare A and B). However, in the presence of external Ca2+, the outward current seen at 1 μm ATP was more sustained, presumably due to the involvement of a Ca2+ influx component in this response. Most cells showed a quick run down of the membrane conductance with a duration of about 2–3 min at any given ATP concentration. This is consistent with a previous report showing that ATP induced transient 45Ca2+ influx and IP3 production (19Kurihara K. Nakanishi N. Ueha T. Arch. Oral Biol. 1997; 42: 547-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) in HSG cells. Measurement of [Ca2+]i (expressed as the 340/380-nm fluorescence ratio) demonstrated that an increase in [Ca2+]i was induced upon the addition of ATP in 94% of HSG cells (254 of 270). Most cells (84%, 212 of 254) showed a response at 1 μm ATP, with a few cells responding at 0.1 (9%, 24 of 254) or 10 μm ATP (7%, 18 of 254). Importantly, while a response to lower [ATP] was detected, a higher [ATP] added subsequently to the same cell failed to evoke a second response. A typical dose response in the presence or absence of external Ca2+ is shown in Fig. 1 C. In the absence of external Ca2+, the initial peak increase in [Ca2+]i was not changed, although the response was more transient in nature. This suggests that both intracellular Ca2+ release and Ca2+ influx account for the ATP-induced increase in [Ca2+]i.Further, this pattern of [Ca2+]i increase was not changed when Na+ was removed from the external medium (n = 35, data not shown). However, when Mg2+ was removed from the medium as shown in Fig.1 D, a small increase in [Ca2+]i was induced with 100 μm ATP in a Ca2+-containing medium. These data suggest that, at 100 μm, ATP induces a Ca2+ influx component that is inhibited by external Mg2+. This is also consistent with studies in pancreatic duct cells (23Christoffersen B.C. Hug M.J. Novak I. Pflugers Arch. 1998; 426: 33-39Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and other salivary gland cells (6Turner J.T. Landon L.A. Gibbons S.J. Talamo B.R. Crit Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), showing that removal of external Mg2+ increased the ATP-induced peak [Ca2+]i. However, since the K+current measurements (shown in Fig. 1, A and B) were made in the presence of external Mg2+, the K+ current induced at 100 μm ATP is probably not associated with Ca2+ influx. UTP, a potent agonist of several P2Y receptors, stimulates IP3 generation and release of Ca2+ from intracellular Ca2+ stores (1Burnstock G. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 1127-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 2Burnstock G. King B.F. Drug Dev. Res. 1996; 38: 67-71Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 3Dubyak G.R. El-Moatassim C. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C577-C606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Motte S. Communi D. Pirotton S. Boeynaems J-M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 27: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Unlike with ATP, sequential additions of increasing [UTP] induced an increase in [Ca2+]i and outward current only at 1 μm (Fig. 2, A and B). This pattern was not changed in the absence of external Mg2+ or with 10 mm external Mg2+ (n = 43, data not shown). However, prior stimulation of cells with UTP attenuated the [Ca2+]i increase induced by a subsequent addition of ATP to the same cell, and vice versa (see Fig. 2, C and D). As seen with UTP, only low [2MeS-ATP] induced a response. However, the response was lower than that induced by ATP or UTP (data not shown). We have recently reported that depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores in HSG cells by muscarinic receptor stimulation with CCh, introduction of IP3 into the cell, or treatment with the Ca2+ pump inhibitor Tg, activated ISOC, which was dependent on external [Ca2+] and inhibited by La3+ and Gd3+ (17Liu X. O'Connell A. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33295-33304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The data in Fig. 3show that ATP (1 μm) also induced an inward Ca2+ current in HSG cells. This inward current was dependent on external [Ca2+] and was eliminated by changing the external [Ca2+] from 10 to 0 mm(Fig. 3 A). ATP-induced ISOC had a larger amplitude (25 ± 7 pA), but a shorter duration (3–4 min), compared with that induced by IP3 or CCh (17Liu X. O'Connell A. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33295-33304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and was inhibited by La3+ (Fig. 3 B). Notably, ATP (1 μm)-induced inward Ca2+ and outward K+ currents displayed similar characteristics i.e. dependence on external Ca2+ and inhibition by La3+ (Fig. 3, compare A and B with C and D). Further, stimulation of cells with ATP in a Ca2+-free medium inhibited the response to a subsequent addition of CCh (data not shown). This is the first report of ATP-induced Isoc in a salivary cell. Taken together, these data demonstrate that in HSG cells low [ATP] (<10 μm) stimulates P2U (P2Y2) receptors to cause the release of Ca2+ from internal Ca2+ stores, which results in the activation of KCa and ISOC. Fig. 1 shows that high [ATP] activates a K+current in HSG cells that is not accompanied by any changes [Ca2+]i. To determine the nature of this K+ current, we examined the effect of depletion of the intracellular Ca2+ store with Tg. [Ca2+]i was monitored in the absence of external Ca2+, and data are shown in Fig.4 A. Tg induced an increase in [Ca2+]i due to Ca2+ “leakage” from the internal stores. The subsequent addition of ATP (10–100 μm) to the cells failed to induce any further increase in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 4 A). This suggests that the [Ca2+]i increase induced by ATP is due to Ca2+ release from Tg-sensitive stores. Similarly Tg-induced increases in [Ca2+]i or the KCacurrent were diminished or greatly reduced after the cell was first exposed to ATP (n = 56 or n = 4 for [Ca2+]i and the KCa currents, respectively; data not shown). In contrast to [Ca2+]i increases shown in Fig. 4 A, 100 μm ATP induced an increase in the outward current in Tg-treated cells (Fig. 4 B). When external Ca2+was reintroduced, a further increase in the outward current was seen, probably due to the activation of KCa as a result of Ca2+ entry. These results clearly indicate that two kinds of outward K+ currents are stimulated by ATP in HSG cells. One is associated with [Ca2+]i increase, and the other appears to be independent of [Ca2+]iincrease. Consistent with the [Ca2+]imeasurements shown in Fig. 4 A, Tg induced a transient activation of the K+ current. In aggregate, the data presented above indicate that in HSG cells ATP (100 μm) activates a K+ current that is not (i) due to activation of KCa or (ii) accompanied by increases in [Ca2+]i. To further characterize the apparent Ca2+-independent K+ current, the effect of charybdotoxin (ChTx) was examined. We reported earlier that ChTx, a large conductance Ca2+-dependent K+ channel antagonist, inhibits the carbachol-stimulated KCa current in HSG cells (16Liu X. Rojas S.E. Ambudkar I.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C571-C580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As seen in Fig.5 A, 25 nm ChTx also effectively blocked the K+ current induced by 1 and 10 μm ATP but not that induced by 100 μm ATP (Fig. 5 A). The I-V curve of the outward current induced by 100 μm ATP in ChTx-treated cells shows a weak inward rectification with a reversal potential of −75 mV, which is close to the K+ reversal potential (Fig. 5 B). Furthermore, replacing intracellular K+ ion with Cs+ eliminated ATP-induced outward currents at all concentrations tested (from 1 μm to 1 mm, n = 5, data not shown). These data suggest that high [ATP] activates an inwardly rectifying, Ca2+-independent, K+ current in HSG cells. In addition to the P2U receptor, a P2Z subtype of P2 receptor (P2X7) has also been found in the salivary gland cells (6Turner J.T. Landon L.A. Gibbons S.J. Talamo B.R. Crit Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the Ca2+-independent ChTx-insensitive K+ channel was stimulated by the activation of a P2Z receptor, we examined the effects of Bz-ATP, a potent agonist of the P2Z receptor, on [Ca2+]i and whole cell current. The data are shown in Fig. 6. Fig. 6, A and B, shows whole cell currents following the sequential additions of 1, 10, 100, and 1000 μm Bz-ATP to HSG cells in Ca2+-containing and Ca2+-free medium, respectively. In the presence of external Ca2+ (Fig.6 A), Bz-ATP activated a K+ current at all concentrations tested, with the largest response, a somewhat sustained increase, obtained at 100 μm. No significant response was seen at 1 mm Bz-ATP. When cells were stimulated in the absence of external Ca2+ (Fig. 6 B), the response at 1 μm Bz-ATP was relatively more transient, while that at 10 μm was greatly attenuated, and that at 100 μm was barely detectable. Thus, Bz-ATP, at higher concentrations, appeared to stimulate K+ currents only in the presence of external Ca2+. Similar effects of Bz-ATP were seen on [Ca2+]i (Fig. 6, C and D). P2Z-associated cation channels in salivary gland cells are reportedly permeable to external Na+ and inhibited by external Mg2+ (6Turner J.T. Landon L.A. Gibbons S.J. Talamo B.R. Crit Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). However, the Bz-ATP-induced [Ca2+]i increase did not appear to be affected by replacing Na+ in the external medium with NMDG (Fig.7 A). Further, as shown in Fig.7 B, external Mg2+ attenuated the [Ca2+]i increases induced at all concentrations of Bz-ATP but especially that at 100 μm. In the presence of 3 mm external [Mg2+], attenuated [Ca2+]i increases were observed in 35% of cells tested (23 of 65), while [Ca2+]i increase was not detected in 65% of the cells. Furthermore, 10 mmMg2+ totally eliminated Bz-ATP (1 μm to 1 mm) induced responses (data not shown, n = 35). In aggregate, these data demonstrate the presence of a P2Z (P2X7) receptor in HSG cells, which can be activated by Bz-ATP to stimulate Ca2+ influx, via an as yet unidentified ion channel. Low Bz-ATP also stimulates internal Ca2+ release, probably via IP3 generation or by an as yet unidentified mechanism (6Turner J.T. Landon L.A. Gibbons S.J. Talamo B.R. Crit Rev. Oral Biol.

The resulting increase in [Ca2+]i activates KCa. However, the data are not consistent with the involvement of the P2Zreceptor in the activation of the ChTx-insensitive, Ca2+-independent, inwardly rectifying K+channel by high [ATP].Figure 7Effect of external Na+ and Mg2+ on Bz-ATP-induced increases in [Ca2+]i.

In the absence of a nonenzymatic source of hydroxide ions, an alanine substitution for residue Asp-324 reduced exonuclease activity 10–100-fold more than alanine substitutions for the other metal-binding residues, Asp-112 and Asp-219. Thus, exonuclease activity is reduced 105-fold for the D324A-DNA polymerase compared with the wild-type enzyme, while decreases of 103- to 104-fold are detected for the D219A- and D112A/E114A-DNA polymerases, respectively. Our results are consistent with the proposal that a water molecule, coordinated by metal ion A, forms a metal-hydroxide ion that is oriented to attack the phosphodiester bond at the site of cleavage.

A two-metal ion mechanism for the 3′ → 5′ exonuclease activity of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I (DNA pol I)1 has been proposed from structural and mutational studies (10Freemont P.S.

The two divalent metal ions, which may be Mg2+, Mn2+, or Zn2+ (10Freemont P.S. Friedman J.M. Beese L.S. Sanderson M.R. Steitz T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8924-8928Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), are bound by conserved carboxylate residues in the exonuclease active centers of proofreading DNA polymerases (reviewed in Refs. 13Joyce C.M. Steitz T.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 777-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar and 14Blasco L. Bernad A. Salas M. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 112: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). According to the model (Fig.1), a water molecule, coordinated by metal ion A, forms an attacking hydroxide ion, which is positioned in-line with the target phosphodiester bond. Metal ion B is proposed to stabilize the leaving 3′-hydroxy group and to position the O-P-O bond angles in the transition state (12Beese L. Steitz T.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). The two metal ions are central to the model because amino acid substitutions that prevent binding of one or both metal ions reduce exonuclease activity several thousandfold. The conservation of metal ion binding residues in the exonuclease active centers of all proofreading DNA polymerases, and the severe reduction in exonuclease activity when the metal binding residues are replaced by non-carboxylate residues, suggest a common mechanism for the hydrolysis reaction catalyzed by DNA polymerases (13Joyce C.M. Steitz T.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 777-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar).The two-metal ion mechanism may extend to other enzymes that catalyze phosphoryl transfer, for example, bacterial alkaline phosphatase, RNase H of the human immunodeficiency virus reverse transcriptase, single-stranded P1 nuclease, and phospholipase (reviewed in Ref. 15Steitz T.A. Steitz J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6498-6502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar). As observed for E. coli DNA pol I, a distance of about 3.9 Å separates two essential metal ions in the active centers of these enzymes. These observations led Steitz and Steitz (15Steitz T.A. Steitz J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6498-6502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar) to propose that RNA molecules involved in hydrolysis and splicing reactions may similarly position two divalent metal ions to carry out phosphoryl transfer reactions. A two-metal ion model for the hammerhead ribozyme mechanism is illustrated in Fig. 2, but catalysis does not require a metal hydroxide ion (16Pontius B.W. Lott W.B. von Hippel P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Sci. 1996; 21: 220-224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Both one- and two-metal ion models for hammerhead ribozyme activity require the ribose 2′-OH group, which is not present in DNA (Fig.2). Since DNA does not have the 2′-OH, different mechanisms of metal-assisted hydrolysis of RNA and DNA are predicted.Figure 2Proposed two-metal ion model for the hydrolysis reaction catalyzed by the hammerhead ribozyme, adapted from Pontius et al.

Grindley N.D.F. Joyce C.M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). We present data here from pH and buffer studies of the exonuclease reaction catalyzed by wild-type and mutant bacteriophage T4 DNA polymerases that are consistent with formation of a metal hydroxide ion. Our studies focus on the ExoIII motif, which is conserved in the 3′ → 5′ exonuclease active centers of proofreading DNA polymerases (13Joyce C.M. Steitz T.A. Annu. Rev.

The motif sequence is a tyrosine residue, followed by three amino acids, and then an aspartate residue, which is a ligand to metal ion A (5Reha-Krantz L.J. Stocki S. Nonay R.L. Dimayuga E.

The other essential residues for the 3′ → 5′ exonuclease activity of E. coli DNA pol I are Asp-355, which may provide another ligand to metal ion A, and residue Asp-424, which provides a ligand to metal ion B (Fig. 1). The corresponding phage DNA polymerase residues are Asp-112 and Asp-219 in the T4 DNA polymerase and Asp-114 and Asp-222 in the RB69 DNA polymerase (Fig. 3). Functional similarities for the bacterial and phage DNA polymerases have also been demonstrated. For example, alanine substitutions for residue Asp-501 in E. coli DNA pol I and for residue Asp-324 in T4 DNA polymerase reduce 3′ → 5′ exonuclease activity by 3–4 orders of magnitude (5Reha-Krantz L.J.

The large reductions in exonuclease activity indicate that Asp-501 in E. coli DNA pol I and Asp-324 in T4 DNA polymerase are essential for catalysis. Smaller reductions in exonuclease activity are detected when phenylalanine is substituted for Tyr-497 in E. coli DNA pol I (11Derbyshire V. Grindley N.D.F. Joyce C.M.

A 10-fold lower residual exonuclease activity was detected for the T4 D324A-DNA polymerase in HEPES compared with Tris buffer. However, just a 2-fold lower residual activity was detected in HEPES buffer for the D112A/E114A- and D219A-DNA polymerases. The larger drop in residual exonuclease activity for the D324A-DNA polymerase in HEPES compared with Tris buffer indicates that residue Asp-324 function can be fulfilled partially by Tris buffer. We propose that Tris may interact with the T4 DNA polymerase in the exonuclease active center to produce a locally high concentration of hydroxide ions or, possibly, to act directly as a nucleophile. The implication of this proposal for the wild-type T4 DNA polymerase is that metal ion A, bound by residue Asp-324, normally provides this function by coordinating a water molecule to form an attacking metal-hydroxide ion, as proposed for E. coli DNA pol I (Ref. 12Beese L. Steitz T.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar; Fig. 1). For T4 DNA polymerase, residues Glu-114 and Lys-299 may assist formation of the attacking hydroxide ion at physiological pH. Additionally, T4 DNA polymerase residue Tyr-320 appears to assist orientation of the DNA substrate in the catalytically active conformation.

EMBO J. 1991; 10: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 12Beese L. Steitz T.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). The two divalent metal ions, which may be Mg2+, Mn2+, or Zn2+ (10Freemont P.S. Friedman J.M. Beese L.S. Sanderson M.R. Steitz T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8924-8928Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), are bound by conserved carboxylate residues in the exonuclease active centers of proofreading DNA polymerases (reviewed in Refs. 13Joyce C.M. Steitz T.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 777-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar and 14Blasco L. Bernad A. Salas M. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 112: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). According to the model (Fig.1), a water molecule, coordinated by metal ion A, forms an attacking hydroxide ion, which is positioned in-line with the target phosphodiester bond. Metal ion B is proposed to stabilize the leaving 3′-hydroxy group and to position the O-P-O bond angles in the transition state (12Beese L. Steitz T.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). The two metal ions are central to the model because amino acid substitutions that prevent binding of one or both metal ions reduce exonuclease activity several thousandfold. The conservation of metal ion binding residues in the exonuclease active centers of all proofreading DNA polymerases, and the severe reduction in exonuclease activity when the metal binding residues are replaced by non-carboxylate residues, suggest a common mechanism for the hydrolysis reaction catalyzed by DNA polymerases (13Joyce C.M. Steitz T.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 777-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). The two-metal ion mechanism may extend to other enzymes that catalyze phosphoryl transfer, for example, bacterial alkaline phosphatase, RNase H of the human immunodeficiency virus reverse transcriptase, single-stranded P1 nuclease, and phospholipase (reviewed in Ref. 15Steitz T.A. Steitz J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6498-6502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar). As observed for E. coli DNA pol I, a distance of about 3.9 Å separates two essential metal ions in the active centers of these enzymes. These observations led Steitz and Steitz (15Steitz T.A. Steitz J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6498-6502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar) to propose that RNA molecules involved in hydrolysis and splicing reactions may similarly position two divalent metal ions to carry out phosphoryl transfer reactions. A two-metal ion model for the hammerhead ribozyme mechanism is illustrated in Fig. 2, but catalysis does not require a metal hydroxide ion (16Pontius B.W. Lott W.B. von Hippel P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2290-2294Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 17Lott W.B. Pontius B.W. von Hippel P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 542-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), although single-metal-hydroxide-ion models have been proposed (reviewed in Ref. 18Scott W.G. Klug A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 220-224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Both one- and two-metal ion models for hammerhead ribozyme activity require the ribose 2′-OH group, which is not present in DNA (Fig.2). Since DNA does not have the 2′-OH, different mechanisms of metal-assisted hydrolysis of RNA and DNA are predicted. Structural studies of the Klenow fragment of DNA pol I suggest that a water molecule or hydroxide ion is bound to metal ion A (Ref. 12Beese L. Steitz T.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar; Fig.1); however, only one study has examined the pH dependence of the exonuclease reaction and correlation to metal ion p Ka values (11Derbyshire V. Grindley N.D.F. Joyce C.M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). We present data here from pH and buffer studies of the exonuclease reaction catalyzed by wild-type and mutant bacteriophage T4 DNA polymerases that are consistent with formation of a metal hydroxide ion. Our studies focus on the ExoIII motif, which is conserved in the 3′ → 5′ exonuclease active centers of proofreading DNA polymerases (13Joyce C.M. Steitz T.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 777-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 14Blasco L. Bernad A. Salas M. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 112: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The motif sequence is a tyrosine residue, followed by three amino acids, and then an aspartate residue, which is a ligand to metal ion A (5Reha-Krantz L.J. Stocki S. Nonay R.L. Dimayuga E. Goodrich L.D. Konigsberg W.H. Spicer E.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2417-2421Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 13Joyce C.M. Steitz T.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 777-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). The conserved ExoIII residues in E. coli DNA pol I are Tyr-497 and Asp-501 (Fig. 1). The corresponding residues in T4 DNA polymerase are Tyr-320 and Asp-324 (5Reha-Krantz L.J. Stocki S. Nonay R.L. Dimayuga E. Goodrich L.D. Konigsberg W.H. Spicer E.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16621-16629Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and Tyr-323 and Asp-327 in the T4-like RB69 DNA polymerase (Refs. 21Wang C.-C. Yeh L.-S. Karam J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26558-26564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar and 22Wang J., A.K.M. Sattar Wang C.C. Karam J.D. Konigsberg W.H. Steitz W.H. Cell. 1997; 89: 1087-1099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar; Fig.3). Note the structural similarities in the exonuclease active centers of the bacterial and phage enzymes (Ref. 22Wang J., A.K.M. Sattar Wang C.C. Karam J.D. Konigsberg W.H. Steitz W.H. Cell. 1997; 89: 1087-1099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar; compare Figs. 1 and 3). The other essential residues for the 3′ → 5′ exonuclease activity of E. coli DNA pol I are Asp-355, which may provide another ligand to metal ion A, and residue Asp-424, which provides a ligand to metal ion B (Fig. 1). The corresponding phage DNA polymerase residues are Asp-112 and Asp-219 in the T4 DNA polymerase and Asp-114 and Asp-222 in the RB69 DNA polymerase (Fig. 3). Functional similarities for the bacterial and phage DNA polymerases have also been demonstrated. For example, alanine substitutions for residue Asp-501 in E. coli DNA pol I and for residue Asp-324 in T4 DNA polymerase reduce 3′ → 5′ exonuclease activity by 3–4 orders of magnitude (5Reha-Krantz L.J. Stocki S. Nonay R.L. Dimayuga E. Goodrich L.D. Konigsberg W.H. Spicer E.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2417-2421Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 6Reha-Krantz L.J. Nonay R.L.

The large reductions in exonuclease activity indicate that Asp-501 in E. coli DNA pol I and Asp-324 in T4 DNA polymerase are essential for catalysis. Smaller reductions in exonuclease activity are detected when phenylalanine is substituted for Tyr-497 in E. coli DNA pol I (11Derbyshire V. Grindley N.D.F. Joyce C.M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) and when phenylalanine or alanine are substituted for Tyr-320 in T4 DNA pol (20Sattar A.K.M.A. Lin T-C. Jones C. Konigsberg W.H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16621-16629Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar); hence, the conserved tyrosine residue in the ExoIII motif plays an important, but ancillary role, in catalysis. We extend previous studies (5Reha-Krantz L.J. Stocki S. Nonay R.L. Dimayuga E. Goodrich L.D. Konigsberg W.H. Spicer E.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2417-2421Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 6Reha-Krantz L.J. Nonay R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27100-27108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Frey M.W.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16621-16629Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) of mutant DNA polymerases with reduced ability to bind metal ions in the exonuclease active center by demonstrating that the residual exonuclease activity reported for some of the mutants is due partially to the buffering agent, most frequently Tris. A 10-fold lower residual exonuclease activity was detected for the T4 D324A-DNA polymerase in HEPES compared with Tris buffer. However, just a 2-fold lower residual activity was detected in HEPES buffer for the D112A/E114A- and D219A-DNA polymerases. The larger drop in residual exonuclease activity for the D324A-DNA polymerase in HEPES compared with Tris buffer indicates that residue Asp-324 function can be fulfilled partially by Tris buffer. We propose that Tris may interact with the T4 DNA polymerase in the exonuclease active center to produce a locally high concentration of hydroxide ions or, possibly, to act directly as a nucleophile. The implication of this proposal for the wild-type T4 DNA polymerase is that metal ion A, bound by residue Asp-324, normally provides this function by coordinating a water molecule to form an attacking metal-hydroxide ion, as proposed for E. coli DNA pol I (Ref. 12Beese L. Steitz T.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar; Fig. 1). For T4 DNA polymerase, residues Glu-114 and Lys-299 may assist formation of the attacking hydroxide ion at physiological pH. Additionally, T4 DNA polymerase residue Tyr-320 appears to assist orientation of the DNA substrate in the catalytically active conformation. We thank M. Otto for the initial observation that the 3′ → 5′ exonuclease activity of the D324A-DNA polymerase is reduced significantly in HEPES buffer; L. Bloom for preliminary experiments; J. Wang, and T.
