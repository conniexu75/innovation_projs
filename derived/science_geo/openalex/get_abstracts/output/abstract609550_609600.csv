https://openalex.org/W2800434159,"Here we analyse genetic variation, population structure and diversity among 3,010 diverse Asian cultivated rice (Oryza sativa L.) genomes from the 3,000 Rice Genomes Project. Our results are consistent with the five major groups previously recognized, but also suggest several unreported subpopulations that correlate with geographic location. We identified 29 million single nucleotide polymorphisms, 2.4 million small indels and over 90,000 structural variations that contribute to within- and between-population variation. Using pan-genome analyses, we identified more than 10,000 novel full-length protein-coding genes and a high number of presence-absence variations. The complex patterns of introgression observed in domestication genes are consistent with multiple independent rice domestication events. The public availability of data from the 3,000 Rice Genomes Project provides a resource for rice genomics research and breeding."
https://openalex.org/W2802777054,"Integrated-photonics microchips now enable a range of advanced functionalities for high-coherence applications such as data transmission, highly optimized physical sensors, and harnessing quantum states, but with cost, efficiency, and portability much beyond tabletop experiments. Through high-volume semiconductor processing built around advanced materials there exists an opportunity for integrated devices to impact applications cutting across disciplines of basic science and technology. Here we show how to synthesize the absolute frequency of a lightwave signal, using integrated photonics to implement lasers, system interconnects, and nonlinear frequency comb generation. The laser frequency output of our synthesizer is programmed by a microwave clock across 4 THz near 1550 nm with 1 Hz resolution and traceability to the SI second. This is accomplished with a heterogeneously integrated III/V-Si tunable laser, which is guided by dual dissipative-Kerr-soliton frequency combs fabricated on silicon chips. Through out-of-loop measurements of the phase-coherent, microwave-to-optical link, we verify that the fractional-frequency instability of the integrated photonics synthesizer matches the $7.0*10^{-13}$ reference-clock instability for a 1 second acquisition, and constrain any synthesis error to $7.7*10^{-15}$ while stepping the synthesizer across the telecommunication C band. Any application of an optical frequency source would be enabled by the precision optical synthesis presented here. Building on the ubiquitous capability in the microwave domain, our results demonstrate a first path to synthesis with integrated photonics, leveraging low-cost, low-power, and compact features that will be critical for its widespread use."
https://openalex.org/W2767661975,"An entangled quantum state of two or more particles or objects exhibits some of the most peculiar features of quantum mechanics. Entangled systems cannot be described independently of each other even though they may have an arbitrarily large spatial separation. Reconciling this property with the inherent uncertainty in quantum states is at the heart of some of the most famous debates in the development of quantum theory. Nonetheless, entanglement nowadays has a solid theoretical and experimental foundation, and it is the crucial resource behind many emerging quantum technologies. Entanglement has been demonstrated for microscopic systems, such as with photons, ions, and electron spins, and more recently in microwave and electromechanical devices. For macroscopic objects, however, entanglement becomes exceedingly fragile towards environmental disturbances. A major outstanding goal has been to create and verify the entanglement between the motional states of slowly-moving massive objects. Here, we carry out such an experimental demonstration, with the moving bodies realized as two micromechanical oscillators coupled to a microwave-frequency electromagnetic cavity that is used to create and stabilise the entanglement of the centre-of-mass motion of the oscillators. We infer the existence of entanglement in the steady state by combining measurement of correlated mechanical fluctuations with an analysis of the microwaves emitted from the cavity. Our work qualitatively extends the range of entangled physical systems, with implications in quantum information processing, precision measurement, and tests of the limits of quantum mechanics."
https://openalex.org/W3103867588,"Entanglement, an essential feature of quantum theory that allows for inseparable quantum correlations to be shared between distant parties, is a crucial resource for quantum networks1. Of particular importance is the ability to distribute entanglement between remote objects that can also serve as quantum memories. This has been previously realized using systems such as warm2,3 and cold atomic vapours4,5, individual atoms6 and ions7,8, and defects in solid-state systems9–11. Practical communication applications require a combination of several advantageous features, such as a particular operating wavelength, high bandwidth and long memory lifetimes. Here we introduce a purely micromachined solid-state platform in the form of chip-based optomechanical resonators made of nanostructured silicon beams. We create and demonstrate entanglement between two micromechanical oscillators across two chips that are separated by 20 centimetres . The entangled quantum state is distributed by an optical field at a designed wavelength near 1,550 nanometres. Therefore, our system can be directly incorporated in a realistic fibre-optic quantum network operating in the conventional optical telecommunication band. Our results are an important step towards the development of large-area quantum networks based on silicon photonics. Remote quantum entanglement is demonstrated in a micromachined solid-state system comprising two optomechanical oscillators across two chips physically separated by 20 cm and with an optical separation of around 70 m."
https://openalex.org/W2798125601,"For nearly two decades, researchers in the field of plasmonics1—which studies the coupling of electromagnetic waves to the motion of free electrons near the surface of a metal2—have sought to realize subwavelength optical devices for information technology3–6, sensing7,8, nonlinear optics9,10, optical nanotweezers11 and biomedical applications12. However, the electron motion generates heat through ohmic losses. Although this heat is desirable for some applications such as photo-thermal therapy, it is a disadvantage in plasmonic devices for sensing and information technology13 and has led to a widespread view that plasmonics is too lossy to be practical. Here we demonstrate that the ohmic losses can be bypassed by using ‘resonant switching’. In the proposed approach, light is coupled to the lossy surface plasmon polaritons only in the device’s off state (in resonance) in which attenuation is desired, to ensure large extinction ratios between the on and off states and allow subpicosecond switching. In the on state (out of resonance), destructive interference prevents the light from coupling to the lossy plasmonic section of a device. To validate the approach, we fabricated a plasmonic electro-optic ring modulator. The experiments confirm that low on-chip optical losses, operation at over 100 gigahertz, good energy efficiency, low thermal drift and a compact footprint can be combined in a single device. Our result illustrates that plasmonics has the potential to enable fast, compact on-chip sensing and communications technologies. Ohmic losses in plasmonic devices can be reduced by exploiting ‘resonant switching’, in which light couples to surface plasmon polaritons only when in resonance and bypasses them otherwise."
https://openalex.org/W2802402149,"The discovery of RNAs (for example, messenger RNAs, non-coding RNAs) in sperm has opened the possibility that sperm may function by delivering additional paternal information aside from solely providing the DNA 1 . Increasing evidence now suggests that sperm small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) can mediate intergenerational transmission of paternally acquired phenotypes, including mental stress2,3 and metabolic disorders4–6. How sperm sncRNAs encode paternal information remains unclear, but the mechanism may involve RNA modifications. Here we show that deletion of a mouse tRNA methyltransferase, DNMT2, abolished sperm sncRNA-mediated transmission of high-fat-diet-induced metabolic disorders to offspring. Dnmt2 deletion prevented the elevation of RNA modifications (m5C, m2G) in sperm 30–40 nt RNA fractions that are induced by a high-fat diet. Also, Dnmt2 deletion altered the sperm small RNA expression profile, including levels of tRNA-derived small RNAs and rRNA-derived small RNAs, which might be essential in composing a sperm RNA ‘coding signature’ that is needed for paternal epigenetic memory. Finally, we show that Dnmt2-mediated m5C contributes to the secondary structure and biological properties of sncRNAs, implicating sperm RNA modifications as an additional layer of paternal hereditary information. Zhang et al. report that tRNA methyltransferase Dnmt2 is required for sperm small-non-coding-RNA-mediated transmission of paternal metabolic disorders to the offspring."
https://openalex.org/W2802099741,"Gasdermins mediate inflammatory cell death after cleavage by caspases or other, unknown enzymes. The cleaved N-terminal fragments bind to acidic membrane lipids to form pores, but the mechanism of pore formation remains unresolved. Here we present the cryo-electron microscopy structures of the 27-fold and 28-fold single-ring pores formed by the N-terminal fragment of mouse GSDMA3 (GSDMA3-NT) at 3.8 and 4.2 Å resolutions, and of a double-ring pore at 4.6 Å resolution. In the 27-fold pore, a 108-stranded anti-parallel β-barrel is formed by two β-hairpins from each subunit capped by a globular domain. We identify a positively charged helix that interacts with the acidic lipid cardiolipin. GSDMA3-NT undergoes radical conformational changes upon membrane insertion to form long, membrane-spanning β-strands. We also observe an unexpected additional symmetric ring of GSDMA3-NT subunits that does not insert into the membrane in the double-ring pore, which may represent a pre-pore state of GSDMA3-NT. These structures provide a basis that explains the activities of several mutant gasdermins, including defective mutants that are associated with cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2754216506,"Mitochondria are ATP-generating organelles, the endosymbiotic origin of which was a key event in the evolution of eukaryotic cells1. Despite strong phylogenetic evidence that mitochondria had an alphaproteobacterial ancestry2, efforts to pinpoint their closest relatives among sampled alphaproteobacteria have generated conflicting results, complicating detailed inferences about the identity and nature of the mitochondrial ancestor. While most studies support the idea that mitochondria evolved from an ancestor related to Rickettsiales3–9, an order that includes several host-associated pathogenic and endosymbiotic lineages10,11, others have suggested that mitochondria evolved from a free-living group12–14. Here we re-evaluate the phylogenetic placement of mitochondria. We used genome-resolved binning of oceanic metagenome datasets and increased the genomic sampling of Alphaproteobacteria with twelve divergent clades, and one clade representing a sister group to all Alphaproteobacteria. Subsequent phylogenomic analyses that specifically address long branch attraction and compositional bias artefacts suggest that mitochondria did not evolve from Rickettsiales or any other currently recognized alphaproteobacterial lineage. Rather, our analyses indicate that mitochondria evolved from a proteobacterial lineage that branched off before the divergence of all sampled alphaproteobacteria. In light of this new result, previous hypotheses on the nature of the mitochondrial ancestor6,15,16 should be re-evaluated. Genome data for thirteen alphaproteobacteria-related clades expand the coverage of alphaproteobacterial diversity and suggest that mitochondria diverged from Alphaproteobacteria before the diversification of all currently known alphaproteobacterial lineages."

https://openalex.org/W2799320595,"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is known to carry heavy mutation load. Besides smoking, cytidine deaminase APOBEC3B plays a key role in the mutation process of NSCLC. APOBEC3B is also reported to be upregulated and predicts bad prognosis in NSCLC. However, targeting APOBEC3B high NSCLC is still a big challenge. Here we show that APOBEC3B upregulation is significantly associated with immune gene expression, and APOBEC3B expression positively correlates with known immunotherapy response biomarkers, including: PD-L1 expression and T-cell infiltration in NSCLC. Importantly, APOBEC mutational signature is specifically enriched in NSCLC patients with durable clinical benefit after immunotherapy and APOBEC mutation count can be better than total mutation in predicting immunotherapy response. In together, this work provides evidence that APOBEC3B upregulation and APOBEC mutation count can be used as novel predictive markers in guiding NSCLC checkpoint blockade immunotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2799413964,"The enzyme telomerase adds telomeric repeats to chromosome ends to balance the loss of telomeres during genome replication. Telomerase regulation has been implicated in cancer, other human diseases, and ageing, but progress towards clinical manipulation of telomerase has been hampered by the lack of structural data. Here we present the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the substrate-bound human telomerase holoenzyme at subnanometre resolution, showing two flexibly RNA-tethered lobes: the catalytic core with telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) and conserved motifs of telomerase RNA (hTR), and an H/ACA ribonucleoprotein (RNP). In the catalytic core, RNA encircles TERT, adopting a well-ordered tertiary structure with surprisingly limited protein–RNA interactions. The H/ACA RNP lobe comprises two sets of heterotetrameric H/ACA proteins and one Cajal body protein, TCAB1, representing a pioneering structure of a large eukaryotic family of ribosome and spliceosome biogenesis factors. Our findings provide a structural framework for understanding human telomerase disease mutations and represent an important step towards telomerase-related clinical therapeutics.

https://openalex.org/W2801715076,"The unimolecular nucleophilic substitution (SN1) mechanism features prominently in every introductory organic chemistry course. In principle, stepwise displacement of a leaving group by a nucleophile via a carbocationic intermediate enables the construction of highly congested carbon centres. However, the intrinsic instability and high reactivity of the carbocationic intermediates make it very difficult to control product distributions and stereoselectivity in reactions that proceed via SN1 pathways. Here we report asymmetric catalysis of an SN1-type reaction mechanism that results in the enantioselective construction of quaternary stereocentres from racemic precursors. The transformation relies on the synergistic action of a chiral hydrogen-bond-donor catalyst with a strong Lewis-acid promoter to mediate the formation of tertiary carbocationic intermediates at low temperature and to achieve high levels of control over reaction enantioselectivity and product distribution. This work provides a foundation for the enantioconvergent synthesis of other fully substituted carbon stereocentres."
https://openalex.org/W2790995801,"The linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC) is required for optimal gene activation and prevention of cell death upon activation of immune receptors, including TNFR1 1 . Deficiency in the LUBAC components SHARPIN or HOIP in mice results in severe inflammation in adulthood or embryonic lethality, respectively, owing to deregulation of TNFR1-mediated cell death2-8. In humans, deficiency in the third LUBAC component HOIL-1 causes autoimmunity and inflammatory disease, similar to HOIP deficiency, whereas HOIL-1 deficiency in mice was reported to cause no overt phenotype9-11. Here we show, by creating HOIL-1-deficient mice, that HOIL-1 is as essential for LUBAC function as HOIP, albeit for different reasons: whereas HOIP is the catalytically active component of LUBAC, HOIL-1 is required for LUBAC assembly, stability and optimal retention in the TNFR1 signalling complex, thereby preventing aberrant cell death. Both HOIL-1 and HOIP prevent embryonic lethality at mid-gestation by interfering with aberrant TNFR1-mediated endothelial cell death, which only partially depends on RIPK1 kinase activity. Co-deletion of caspase-8 with RIPK3 or MLKL prevents cell death in Hoil-1-/- (also known as Rbck1-/-) embryos, yet only the combined loss of caspase-8 with MLKL results in viable HOIL-1-deficient mice. Notably, triple-knockout Ripk3-/-Casp8-/-Hoil-1-/- embryos die at late gestation owing to haematopoietic defects that are rescued by co-deletion of RIPK1 but not MLKL. Collectively, these results demonstrate that both HOIP and HOIL-1 are essential LUBAC components and are required for embryogenesis by preventing aberrant cell death. Furthermore, they reveal that when LUBAC and caspase-8 are absent, RIPK3 prevents RIPK1 from inducing embryonic lethality by causing defects in fetal haematopoiesis."
https://openalex.org/W2798555393,"Massive galaxy clusters are now found as early as 3 billion years after the Big Bang, containing stars that formed at even earlier epochs. The high-redshift progenitors of these galaxy clusters, termed 'protoclusters', are identified in cosmological simulations with the highest dark matter overdensities. While their observational signatures are less well defined compared to virialized clusters with a substantial hot intra-cluster medium (ICM), protoclusters are expected to contain extremely massive galaxies that can be observed as luminous starbursts. Recent claimed detections of protoclusters hosting such starbursts do not support the kind of rapid cluster core formation expected in simulations because these structures contain only a handful of starbursting galaxies spread throughout a broad structure, with poor evidence for eventual collapse into a protocluster. Here we report that the source SPT2349-56 consists of at least 14 gas-rich galaxies all lying at z = 4.31 based on sensitive observations of carbon monoxide and ionized carbon. We demonstrate that each of these galaxies is forming stars between 50 and 1000 times faster than our own Milky Way, and all are located within a projected region only $\sim$ 130 kiloparsecs in diameter. This galaxy surface density is more than 10 times the average blank field value (integrated over all redshifts) and $>$1000 times the average field volume density. The velocity dispersion ($\sim$ 410 km s$^{-1}$) of these galaxies and enormous gas and star formation densities suggest that this system represents a galaxy cluster core at an advanced stage of formation when the Universe was only 1.4 billion years old. A comparison with other known protoclusters at high redshifts shows that SPT2349-56 is a uniquely massive and dense system that could be building one of the most massive structures in the Universe today."

https://openalex.org/W2803098705,"During hemolysis, hemoglobin and heme released from red blood cells promote oxidative stress, inflammation and thrombosis. Plasma haptoglobin and hemopexin scavenge free hemoglobin and heme, respectively, but can be depleted in hemolytic states. Haptoglobin and hemopexin supplementation protect tissues, including the vasculature, liver and kidneys. It is widely assumed that these protective effects are due primarily to hemoglobin and heme clearance from the vasculature. However, this simple assumption does not account for the consequent cytoprotective adaptation seen in cells and organs. To further address the mechanism, we used a hyperhemolytic murine model (Townes-SS) of sickle cell disease to examine cellular responses to haptoglobin and hemopexin supplementation. A single infusion of haptoglobin or hemopexin (± equimolar hemoglobin) in SS-mice increased heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in the liver, kidney and skin several fold within 1 hour and decreased nuclear NF-ĸB phospho-p65, and vaso-occlusion for 48 hours after infusion. Plasma hemoglobin and heme levels were not significantly changed 1 hour after infusion of haptoglobin or hemopexin. Haptoglobin and hemopexin also inhibited hypoxia/reoxygenation and lipopolysaccharide-induced vaso-occlusion in SS-mice. Inhibition of HO-1 activity with tin protoporphyrin blocked the protections afforded by haptoglobin and hemopexin in SS-mice. The HO-1 reaction product carbon monoxide, fully restored the protection, in part by inhibiting Weibel-Palade body mobilization of P-selectin and von Willebrand factor to endothelial cell surfaces. Thus, the mechanism by which haptoglobin and hemopexin supplementation in hyperhemolytic SS-mice induces cytoprotective cellular responses is linked to increased HO-1 activity."
https://openalex.org/W2797263535,"The structural and metamorphic evolution of the lower crust has direct effects on the lithospheric response to plate tectonic processes involved in orogeny, including subsidence of sedimentary basins, stability of deep mountain roots and extension of high-topography regions. Recent research shows that before orogeny most of the lower crust is dry, impermeable and mechanically strong 1 . During an orogenic event, the evolution of the lower crust is controlled by infiltration of fluids along localized shear or fracture zones. In the Bergen Arcs of Western Norway, shear zones initiate as faults generated by lower-crustal earthquakes. Seismic slip in the dry lower crust requires stresses at a level that can only be sustained over short timescales or local weakening mechanisms. However, normal earthquake activity in the seismogenic zone produces stress pulses that drive aftershocks in the lower crust 2 . Here we show that the volume of lower crust affected by such aftershocks is substantial and that fluid-driven associated metamorphic and structural transformations of the lower crust follow these earthquakes. This provides a 'top-down' effect on crustal geodynamics and connects processes operating at very different timescales."
https://openalex.org/W2802298457,"Background Growth faltering largely occurs in the first 23 months after birth and is thought to be largely determined by various harmful or protective socioeconomic conditions. Children 23 months or younger, however, have only been partially exposed to these conditions, implying that statistical associations between these conditions and child growth may be substantially smaller in samples that include younger children. Objectives To test the prediction that associations between child anthropometric outcomes and various socioeconomic conditions are systematically different for older and younger children. Methods We analyzed data for 699,421 children aged 0–59 months, drawn from 125 DHS implemented between 1992 and 2014 in 57 countries. The outcome variables were height-for-age Z scores (HAZ) and stunting (HAZ<-2), and weight-for-height z scores (WHZ) and wasting (WHZ<-2). Independent variables included household wealth, parental education, maternal height, demographic factors, and exposure to WASH and health services. We used age-disaggregated regressions to examine how the associations between dependent and independent variables vary across different child age ranges. Results Non-parametric regression results reaffirmed that most linear growth faltering and wasting takes place prior to 23 months of age. Estimates of the magnitude of association with wealth, education and improved toilet use from HAZ regressions are systematically larger in the sample of children 24–59 months than in the 0–23 month or 0–59 month samples; the reverse is true for WHZ regressions. Conclusions Previous observational analyses appear to substantially underestimate the protective impacts of a wide range of underlying determinants on stunting. Conversely, wasting rates are typically low for children 24–59 months, implying that associations between underlying conditions and wasting may be stronger for children 0–23 months of age. Such analyses should pay closer attention to age disaggregation; researchers should be aware of the age effect reported in the current study and present analysis stratified by age."
https://openalex.org/W2800654452,"In the United States (US), the sugarcane aphid (SCA) Melanaphis sacchari (Zehnter) (Hemiptera: Aphididae) was introduced in the 1970s, however at that time it was only considered a pest of sugarcane. In 2013, a massive outbreak of M. sacchari occured on sorghum, resulting in significant economic damage to sorghum grown in North America including the US, Mexico, and Puerto Rico. The aim of the present study was to determine if the SCA pest emergence in American sorghum resulted from the introduction of new genotypes. To this end we used microsatellite markers and COI sequencing to compare the genetic diversity of SCA populations collected in the Americas after the 2013 SCA outbreak on sorghum (during 2013–2017) to older samples collected before the pest outbreak (during 2007–2009). Our results show that the SCA outbreak in the Americas and the Caribbean observed since 2013 belong to populations exhibiting low genetic diversity and consisting of a dominant clonal lineage, MLL-F, which colonizes Sorghum spp. and sugarcane. The comparison of MLL-F specimens collected post-2013 with specimens collected in Louisiana in 2007 revealed that both populations are genetically distinct, according to COI sequencing and microsatellite data analyses. Our result suggest that MLL-F is a new invasive genotype introduced into the Americas that has spread rapidly across sorghum growing regions in the US, Mexico, Honduras and the Caribbean. The origin of this introduction is either Africa or Asia, with Asia being the most probable source."
https://openalex.org/W2802644309,"For the last three decades, content-based image retrieval (CBIR) has been an active research area, representing a viable solution for retrieving similar images from an image repository. In this article, we propose a novel CBIR technique based on the visual words fusion of speeded-up robust features (SURF) and fast retina keypoint (FREAK) feature descriptors. SURF is a sparse descriptor whereas FREAK is a dense descriptor. Moreover, SURF is a scale and rotation-invariant descriptor that performs better in the case of repeatability, distinctiveness, and robustness. It is robust to noise, detection errors, geometric, and photometric deformations. It also performs better at low illumination within an image as compared to the FREAK descriptor. In contrast, FREAK is a retina-inspired speedy descriptor that performs better for classification-based problems as compared to the SURF descriptor. Experimental results show that the proposed technique based on the visual words fusion of SURF-FREAK descriptors combines the features of both descriptors and resolves the aforementioned issues. The qualitative and quantitative analysis performed on three image collections, namely Corel-1000, Corel-1500, and Caltech-256, shows that proposed technique based on visual words fusion significantly improved the performance of the CBIR as compared to the feature fusion of both descriptors and state-of-the-art image retrieval techniques."
https://openalex.org/W2800451623,"Introduction The prevalence and risk-factors of pelvic organ prolapse (POP) in Tanzania are unknown. To help elucidate the problem, we assessed POP and associated risk-factors among Tanzanian women by deploying the POP-Q classification system. Method A cross sectional community based study conducted in Hai, Rombo and Same Districts, Kilimanjaro Region, Tanzania. Women aged 18–90 were recruited through multi-stage random sampling from January to May 2015. Home-based questionnaire interviews were performed and the women were subsequently invited to the nearest health clinic for pelvic examination. Trained physicians used the POP-Q classification system to assess the POP stage. Results A total of 1195 women were interviewed and invited for pelvic examination; 1063(89%) women presented at the clinic of whom 1047(88%) accepted a clinical examination. Of 1047 examined women, 64.6% had an anatomical POP stage II–IV and 6.7% had a severe POP that descended 1 cm or more below the hymen. POP stage II–IV was associated with being aged 35+ years, being a farmer, doing petty trading and having delivered 3 times or more. Severe POP was associated with carrying heavy objects for ≥ 5 hours (OR 4.70;1.67–13.2), having delivered 5 times or more (OR 10.2;2.22–48.6) and having delivered at home (OR 2.40;1.36–4.22). Conclusion POP is a common condition among rural Tanzanian women where 64.6% are having POP grade II-IV and 6.7% are having a severe POP descending 1 cm or more below the hymen. Risk-factors are increasing age, heavy lifting, high parity and home-delivery."

Analysis of conformational dynamics by hydrogen–deuterium exchange in different functional states enriched our understanding of phytochrome signaling and signal integration by effectors. We found that light-induced conformational changes in the phytochrome destabilize the coiled-coil sensor–effector linker, which releases the cyclase regulatory element from an inhibited conformation, increasing cyclase activity of this artificial system.

https://openalex.org/W2802832947,"Reverse transcription of the HIV-1 RNA genome into double-stranded DNA is a central step in viral infection 1 and a common target of antiretroviral drugs 2 . The reaction is catalysed by viral reverse transcriptase (RT)3,4 that is packaged in an infectious virion with two copies of viral genomic RNA 5 each bound to host lysine 3 transfer RNA (tRNALys3), which acts as a primer for initiation of reverse transcription6,7. Upon viral entry into cells, initiation is slow and non-processive compared to elongation8,9. Despite extensive efforts, the structural basis of RT function during initiation has remained a mystery. Here we use cryo-electron microscopy to determine a three-dimensional structure of an HIV-1 RT initiation complex. In our structure, RT is in an inactive polymerase conformation with open fingers and thumb and with the nucleic acid primer-template complex shifted away from the active site. The primer binding site (PBS) helix formed between tRNALys3 and HIV-1 RNA lies in the cleft of RT and is extended by additional pairing interactions. The 5' end of the tRNA refolds and stacks on the PBS to create a long helical structure, while the remaining viral RNA forms two helical stems positioned above the RT active site, with a linker that connects these helices to the RNase H region of the PBS. Our results illustrate how RNA structure in the initiation complex alters RT conformation to decrease activity, highlighting a potential target for drug action."
https://openalex.org/W2801105760,"Hepcidin is a peptide hormone that negatively regulates iron efflux and plays an important role in controlling the growth of breast tumors. In patients with breast cancer, the combined expression of hepcidin and its membrane target, ferroportin, predict disease outcome. However, mechanisms that control hepcidin expression in breast cancer cells remain largely unknown. Here, we use three-dimensional breast cancer spheroids derived from cell lines and breast cancer patients to probe mechanisms of hepcidin regulation in breast cancer. We observe that the extent of hepcidin induction and pathways of its regulation are markedly changed in breast cancer cells grown in three dimensions. In monolayer culture, BMPs, particularly BMP6, regulate hepcidin transcription. When breast cancer cells are grown as spheroids, there is a >10-fold induction in hepcidin transcripts. Microarray analysis combined with knockdown experiments reveal that GDF-15 is the primary mediator of this change. The increase in hepcidin as breast cells develop a three-dimensional architecture increases intracellular iron, as indicated by an increase in the iron storage protein ferritin. Immunohistochemical staining of human breast tumors confirms that both GDF-15 and hepcidin are expressed in breast cancer specimens. Further, levels of GDF-15 are significantly correlated with levels of hepcidin at both the mRNA and protein level in patient samples, consistent with a role for GDF-15 in control of hepcidin in human breast tumors. Inclusion of tumor-associated fibroblasts in breast cancer spheroids further induces hepcidin. This induction is mediated by fibroblast-dependent secretion of IL-6. Breast cancer cells grown as spheroids are uniquely receptive to IL-6-dependent induction of hepcidin by tumor-associated fibroblasts, since IL-6 does not induce hepcidin in cells grown as monolayers. Collectively, our results suggest a new paradigm for tumor-mediated control of iron through the control of hepcidin by tumor architecture and the breast tumor microenvironment."
https://openalex.org/W2802741523,"Targeting RAS is one of the greatest challenges in cancer therapy. Oncogenic mutations in NRAS are present in over 25% of melanomas and patients whose tumors harbor NRAS mutations have limited therapeutic options and poor prognosis. Thus far, there are no clinical agents available to effectively target NRAS or any other RAS oncogene. An alternative approach is to identify and target critical tumor vulnerabilities or non-oncogene addictions that are essential for tumor survival. We investigated the consequences of NRAS blockade in NRAS-mutant melanoma and show that decreased expression of the telomerase catalytic subunit, TERT, is a major consequence. TERT silencing or treatment of NRAS-mutant melanoma with the telomerase-dependent telomere uncapping agent, 6-thio-2′-deoxyguanosine (6-thio-dG), led to rapid cell death, along with evidence of both telomeric and non-telomeric DNA damage, increased ROS levels, and upregulation of a mitochondrial antioxidant adaptive response. Combining 6-thio-dG with the mitochondrial inhibitor Gamitrinib attenuated this adaptive response and more effectively suppressed NRAS-mutant melanoma. Our study uncovers a robust dependency of NRAS-mutant melanoma on TERT, and provides proof-of-principle for a new combination strategy to combat this class of tumors, which could be expanded to other tumor types."
https://openalex.org/W2800614513,"Among species, larger animals tend to live longer than smaller ones, however, the opposite seems to be true for dogs—smaller dogs tend to live significantly longer than larger dogs across all breeds. We were interested in the mechanism that may allow for small breeds to age more slowly compared with large breeds in the context of cellular metabolism and oxidative stress. Primary dermal fibroblasts from small and large breed dogs were grown in culture. We measured basal oxygen consumption (OCR), proton leak, and glycolysis using a Seahorse XF96 oxygen flux analyzer. Additionally, we measured rates of reactive species (RS) production, reduced glutathione (GSH) content, mitochondrial content, lipid peroxidation (LPO) damage and DNA (8-OHdg) damage. Our data suggests that as dogs of both size classes age, proton leak is significantly higher in older dogs, regardless of size class. We found that all aspects of glycolysis were significantly higher in larger breeds compared with smaller breeds. We found significant differences between age classes in GSH concentration, and a negative correlation between DNA damage in puppies and mean breed lifespan. Interestingly, RS production showed no differences across size and age class. Thus, large breed dogs may have higher glycolytic rates, and DNA damage, suggesting a potential mechanism for their decreased lifespan compared with small breed dogs."
https://openalex.org/W2800622810,"Kelch-like protein 6 (KLHL6) is an uncharacterized gene mutated in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Here we report that KLHL6 assembles with cullin3 to form a functional cullin–RING ubiquitin ligase. Mutations in KLHL6 inhibit its ligase activity by disrupting the interaction with cullin3. Loss of KLHL6 favours DLBCL growth and survival both in vitro and in xenograft models. We further established that the mRNA decay factor roquin2 is a substrate of KLHL6. Degradation of roquin2 is dependent on B-cell receptor activation, and requires the integrity of the Tyr691 residue in roquin2 that is essential for its interaction with KLHL6. A non-degradable roquin2(Y691F) mutant requires its RNA-binding ability to phenocopy the effect of KLHL6 loss. Stabilization of roquin2 promotes mRNA decay of the tumour suppressor and NF-κB pathway inhibitor, tumour necrosis factor-α-inducible gene 3. Collectively, our findings uncover the tumour suppressing mechanism of KLHL6. Choi et al. find that KLHL6, which is mutated in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, is part of a ubiquitin ligase complex that targets the mRNA decay factor roquin2 for degradation and that loss of KLHL6 enhances cell survival through loss of TNFAIP3."
https://openalex.org/W2799926029,"Ganoderma lucidum is a medicinal mushroom that has been widely used in East Asia for the treatment of various diseases. The pharmacological activity of this fungus is primarily attributable to the polysaccharides and triterpenoids. In this study, to obtain the fruit bodies with improved content of active constituents, we examined the effect of salicylic acid (SA) and calcium ion on the biosynthesis of polysaccharides and triterpenoids by spraying the chemicals during the fruiting. To explore the underlying mechanisms for the variation, the transcripts of related genes involved in the polysaccharide and triterpenoid biosynthesis were measured. Results showed that Ca2+ had no effect on production of polysaccharides and triterpenoids, whereas SA increased triterpenoid content by 23.32%, compared to the control, but it had little influence on polysaccharide production. Interestingly, the combined induction increased polysaccharide and triterpenoid content by 9.02% and 13.61%, respectively, compared to the control. Under Ca2+ induction, the transcript of ugp gene in the polysaccharide biosynthetic pathway up-regulated in all three stages (mycelium, primordium, and fruit body), while pgm and gls gave no response in the mycelium and primordium stages, and up-regulated in the fruit body stage. Differently, six key triterpenoid biosynthetic genes including hmgr, hmgs, mvd, fps, sqs, and ls did not respond to the induction. In the case of SA and combined induction, pgm and ugp were up-regulated in all three stages, while gls showed an increased expression in the primordium stage and no response in other stages. The six triterpenoid biosynthetic genes were up-regulated in all three stages. The present study provides a useful approach to producing G. lucidum fruit bodies with high polysaccharide and triterpenoid content. This is important to the G. lucidum industry."

In experimental studies beta-blocker therapy reversed stroke-induced immunodepression, reduced infection rates and mortality. Recent, heterogeneous studies in stroke patients could not provide evidence of a protective effect of beta-blocker therapy. Aim of this study is to investigate the potential preventive effect of beta-blockers in subgroups of patients at high risk for stroke-induced immunodepression.Data from a prospectively derived registry of major stroke patients receiving endovascular therapy between 2011-2017 in a tertiary stroke center (University Medical Center Göttingen. Germany) was used. The effect of beta-blocker therapy on pneumonia, urinary tract infection, sepsis and mortality was assessed using multivariate logistic regression analysis.Three hundred six patients with a mean age of 72 ± 13 years and a median NIHSS of 16 (IQR 10.75-20) were included. 158 patients (51.6%) had pre-stroke- and continued beta-blocker therapy. Beta-blocker therapy did not reduce the incidence of pneumonia (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.31-1.92, p = 0.584), urinary tract infections (OR 1.51, 0.88-2.60, p = 0.135), sepsis (OR 0.57, 0.18-1.80, p = 0.334) or mortality (OR 0.59, 0.16-2.17, p = 0.429). Strokes involving the insula and anterio-medial cortex increased the risk for pneumonia (OR 4.55, 2.41-8.56, p<0.001) and sepsis (OR 4.13, 1.81-9.43, p = 0.001), while right hemispheric strokes increased the risk for pneumonia (OR 1.60, 0.92-2.77, p = 0.096). There was a non-significantly increased risk for urinary tract infections in patients with beta-blocker therapy and insula/anterio-medial cortex strokes (OR 3.12, 95% CI 0.88-11.05, p = 0.077) with no effect of beta-blocker therapy on pneumonia, sepsis or mortality in both subgroups.In major ischemic stroke patients, beta-blocker therapy did not lower post-stroke infection rates and was associated with urinary tract infections in a subgroup with insula/anterio-medial strokes."
https://openalex.org/W2800685888,"Myelocytomatosis proto-oncogene transcription factor (Myc) is an intrinsically disordered protein with critical roles in cellular homeostasis and neoplastic transformation. It is tightly regulated in the cell, with Myc phosphorylation playing a major role. In addition to the well-described tandem phosphorylation of Thr-52 and Ser-62 in the Myc transactivation domain linked to its degradation, P21 (RAC1)–activated kinase 2 (PAK2)–mediated phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues in the C-terminal basic helix–loop–helix leucine zipper (bHLH-LZ) region regulates Myc transcriptional activity. Here we report that PAK2 preferentially phosphorylates Myc twice, at Thr-358 and Ser-373, with only a minor fraction being modified at the previously identified Thr-400 site. For transcriptional activity, Myc binds E-box DNA elements, requiring its heterodimerization with Myc-associated factor X (Max) via the bHLH-LZ regions. Using isothermal calorimetry (ITC), we found that Myc phosphorylation destabilizes this ternary protein–DNA complex by decreasing Myc's affinity for Max by 2 orders of magnitude, suggesting a major effect of phosphorylation on this complex. Phosphomimetic substitutions revealed that Ser-373 dominates the effect on Myc–Max heterodimerization. Moreover, a T400D substitution disrupted Myc's affinity for Max. ITC, NMR, and CD analyses of several Myc variants suggested that the effect of phosphorylation on the Myc–Max interaction is caused by secondary structure disruption during heterodimerization rather than by a change in the structurally disordered state of Myc or by phosphorylation-induced electrostatic repulsion in the heterodimer. Our findings provide critical insights into the effects of PAK2-catalyzed phosphorylation of Myc on its interactions with Max and DNA."

Focusing on the function of dimerization site 2, we analyzed four variants, I70C/I70A and L75C/L75A, which all could actively bind DNA but are defective in gene silencing. Atomic force microscopy analysis of DNA–H-NS complexes revealed that all of these four variants formed condensed complexes on DNA, whereas WT H-NS formed rigid and extended nucleoprotein filaments, a conformation required for gene silencing.

Recent analysis of the linker identified a role for the five charged residues in initial engagement with DNA, indicating that it is much more than a passive tether (7Gao Y. Foo Y.H. Winardhi R.S.

Ten substitutions were located within the oligomerization domain, and 25 mapped within the DNA-binding domain (Fig. 1, A–C). Most substitutions in the DNA-binding domain mapped within the core DNA-binding motif (TWTG-GR-P) between residues 108–116 (Fig. 1, A and C). Recent findings with Salmonella H-NS have identified two dimerization sites, dimerization site 1 (amino acids 1–42) and dimerization site 2 (residues 57–79), which serve as oligomerization interfaces in head-to-head and tail-to-tail oligomers (25Arold S.T.

Dimerization site 1 in Salmonella H-NS also interacts with Hha (33Ali S.S. Whitney J.C. Stevenson J. Robinson H. Howell P.L. Navarre W.W.

Hha is also a NAP and is partially required for H-NS silencing. In E. coli, Ueda et al. (34Ueda T. Takahashi H. Uyar E. Ishikawa S. Ogasawara N. Oshima T.

In contrast, dimerization site 2 has not been characterized, although amino acids in dimerization site 2 are also conserved among H-NS homologues (Fig. 1D). L65P, a mutant in site 2, is defective in silencing in vivo, but further analysis was not performed (30Donato G.M. Kawula T.H.

Bacteriol. 1999; 181 (9922259): 941-948Google Scholar). In a recent paper, a double mutant (D68V and D71V) in this region showed enhanced H-NS oligomerization and transcriptional repression in vitro (35Giangrossi M. Wintraecken K. Spurio R. de Vries R.

Unfortunately, this study referred to this region as the linker (35Giangrossi M. Wintraecken K. Spurio R. de Vries R.

In H-NS family members, formation of a rigid nucleoprotein filament is essential for gene silencing (14Gordon B.R. Li Y. Cote A. Weirauch M.T. Ding P. Hughes T.R. Navarre W.W. Xia B. Liu J.

Thus, we were inspired to re-examine the role of dimerization site 2 in H-NS function. We created an entire set of H-NS mutants, each carrying a single cysteine substitution from residues 2 to 137. We then examined the ability of these mutants to silence a well-characterized target, the slp promoter of the glutamic acid-dependent acid resistance (GAD) cluster promoters (36Krin E. Danchin A. Soutourina O. Decrypting the H-NS-dependent regulatory cascade of acid stress resistance in Escherichia coli.BMC Microbiol. 2010; 10 (21034467): 27310.1186/1471-2180-10-273Google Scholar, 37Mates A.K. Sayed A.K. Foster J.W. Products of the Escherichia coli acid fitness island attenuate metabolite stress at extremely low pH and mediate a cell density-dependent acid resistance.J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189 (17259322): 2759-276810.1128/JB.01490-06Google Scholar). Two substitutions in dimerization site 2, I70C and L75C, resulted in loss of gene silencing. We then examined the mode of DNA binding using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transverse magnetic tweezers. Our results indicated that the mutants were capable of binding to DNA and forming compact DNA structures but were unable to form higher-ordered nucleoprotein filaments. Thus, the second dimerization site coordinates N-terminal oligomerization and C-terminal DNA binding. Amino acid substitutions can disrupt this site-dependent domain–domain communication, abrogating gene silencing. The Cys-scanned H-NS series constructed in this study will provide a useful tool to analyze H-NS mutants by cysteine modification. The GAD system is a major acid resistance system of E. coli, in which the transcription factor GadE plays a key role in regulating genes involved in acid resistance, including slp, dctR, yhiD, hdeB, hdeA, hdeD, gadE, mdtE, mdtF, gadW, gadX, and gadA (37Mates A.K. Sayed A.K. Foster J.W. Products of the Escherichia coli acid fitness island attenuate metabolite stress at extremely low pH and mediate a cell density-dependent acid resistance.J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189 (17259322): 2759-276810.1128/JB.01490-06Google Scholar). These genes are organized into eight transcription units: slp-dctR, hdeAB-yhiD, hdeD, gadE, mdtEF, gadW, gadX, and gadAX (38Burton N.A. Johnson M.D. Antczak P. Robinson A. Lund P.A. Novel aspects of the acid response network of E. coli K-12 are revealed by a study of transcriptional dynamics.J. Mol. Biol. 2010; 401 (20603130): 726-74210.1016/j.jmb.2010.06.054Google Scholar). Because most of the GAD cluster genes are the targets of silencing by H-NS (34Ueda T. Takahashi H. Uyar E. Ishikawa S. Ogasawara N. Oshima T. Functions of the Hha and YdgT proteins in transcriptional silencing by the nucleoid proteins, H-NS and StpA, in Escherichia coli.DNA Res. 2013; 20 (23543115): 263-27110.1093/dnares/dst008Google Scholar), we used the GAD cluster promoters as representative of H-NS-mediated gene silencing and examined the effect of H-NS cysteine substitution on its silencing ability. For detection of promoter activity, we employed the lux reporter system. For this purpose, the target promoters pgadA, pgadE, pgadW, phdeA, phdeD, and pslp, were inserted into the vector pLUX (38Burton N.A. Johnson M.D. Antczak P. Robinson A. Lund P.A. Novel aspects of the acid response network of E. coli K-12 are revealed by a study of transcriptional dynamics.J. Mol. Biol. 2010; 401 (20603130): 726-74210.1016/j.jmb.2010.06.054Google Scholar). The lux fusion plasmids were introduced into both the parent and the hns-deficient strains. Transformants were harvested at logarithmic phase (OD600 = 0.3), and then luciferase activity was measured. The activity of three promoters, pgadA, pgadW, and pslp, increased more than 10-fold in the hns-deficient strain compared with the parent strain (data not shown). Among these, the slp promoter was selected for systematic analysis of H-NS in E. coli because its activity was the highest in the hns-deficient mutant. To examine the structural and functional roles of H-NS, we constructed an entire set of single Cys-substituted mutants from residues 2 to 136 of H-NS. For this purpose, the lone Cys residue at position 21 in WT H-NS was first converted to Ser, and the resulting C21S mutant hns gene was cloned into pQE80hns-C21S (see “Experimental procedures”). Transformants harboring pLUXslp and pQE80Lhns or pQE80Lhns-C21S, were grown in 96-well plates at 37 °C, and luciferase activity was measured. In E. coli cells, Cys substitutions did not affect cell growth (data not shown). The activity of pslp increased in the hns-deficient strain compared with the parent strain. This enhancement was suppressed by complementation with pQE80Lhns and pQE80Lhns-C21S (Fig. 2A). Using pQE80Lhns-C21S as a template, we next tried to construct 136 single Cys-substituted H-NS mutants at all positions. Except for the A18C mutant, the entire set of single Cys-substituted mutants was obtained. These Cys mutants will be useful for future site-specific modification experiments. To determine the influence of Cys substitution on the silencing activity of H-NS, the pslp reporter plasmid was introduced into an entire array of hns mutants (Table S2). The level of lux reporter expression increased for a subset of H-NS mutants, indicating an inability to silence, as shown in Fig. 2B. The disruption in silencing activity of the H-NS mutants was essentially the same for all three promoters tested. Cys substitution resulted in a marked loss of silencing activity at seven positions in H-NS: four within the DNA-binding domain (T97C, W109C, G111C, and G113C) and three within dimerization site 2 (A67C, I70C, and L75C) (Figure 1, Figure 2). Mutants in dimerization site 1 rarely affected GAD promoters, although others reported that R12C and R54C derepressed proV (28Williams R.M. Rimsky S. Buc H. Probing the structure, function, and interactions of the Escherichia coli H-NS and StpA proteins by using dominant negative derivatives.J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178 (8755860): 4335-434310.1128/jb.178.15.4335-4343.1996Google Scholar). We further examined the effects of site 1 on the GAD promoter. A truncated H-NS, lacking N-terminal residues 1–46 (containing dimerization site 1), could not silence the slp promoter (Fig. 2C). We suspected that additional factors were involved in H-NS function for slp silencing because Hha and YdgT (Cnu) are modulators that interact with oligomerization site 1 of H-NS (33Ali S.S. Whitney J.C. Stevenson J. Robinson H. Howell P.L. Navarre W.W. Structural insights into the regulation of foreign genes in Salmonella by the Hha/H-NS complex.J. Biol. Chem. 10;. 2013; 288 (23515315): 13356-1336910.1074/jbc.M113.455378Google Scholar). The slp promoter activity increased in an hha and ydgT double mutant strain as well as an hns null strain (Fig. 2C), indicating that silencing of the slp promoter requires H-NS, Hha, and YdgT. Therefore, site 1 mutants might prevent slp silencing by Hha and/or YdgT activity (see “Discussion”). As Ile70 and Leu75 are completely conserved among orthologs and paralogs of E. coli H-NS (Fig. 1D), these mutants displayed the largest defect in silencing pslp. We focused on them for a detailed analysis of H-NS structure and function. As an aside, the expression levels of I70C and L75C H-NS were similar to or higher than the WT (Fig. S1), indicating that the loss of silencing was attributable to a loss of function and not due to a reduced level of protein. The loss of the silencing phenotype observed above could be due to an inability to bind slp promoter DNA. To examine this possibility, the DNA binding activity of I70C, I70A, L75C, and L75A mutants was analyzed using an electrophoretic mobility assay (EMSA). WT and the substituted proteins were purified from E. coli. To confirm the secondary structure of the mutant proteins, CD spectrometry analysis was performed, showing that purified H-NS–C21S–I70C displayed two negative maxima at ∼208 and 222 nm and a positive maximum at ∼192 nm and was similar to the WT H-NS and H-NS–C21S (Fig. S2). Estimation of the secondary structure indicated that all of the H-NS WT and mutant proteins had a similar α helix content (92%) (Table S1). We next examined the DNA binding of the H-NS mutants in detail by EMSA. In the presence of WT H-NS, shifted complexes were first apparent at 120 nm (Fig. 3A, lane 4). The pattern of complex formation of the H-NS-C21S protein was similar to the WT but required >2.5-fold higher protein, indicating that the binding property of H-NS–C21S differs from WT H-NS. The two single Cys-substituted mutants, H-NS–C21S–I70C and H-NS–C21S–L75C, also formed protein–DNA complexes (Fig. 3, C and D), as did the Ala-substituted mutants (Fig. 3, E and F), although the binding pattern was different between Cys- and Ala-substituted H-NS (see “Discussion”). These results indicate that the loss of silencing activity of these two H-NS mutants was not due to an inability to bind DNA. To understand the molecular basis of the silencing defect of the mutants in dimerization site 2, we examined DNA binding using AFM. In low-Mg2+ buffers, H-NS forms a rigid filament on DNA, and this filament is the basis for gene silencing (4Winardhi R.S. Yan J. Kenney L.J.

https://openalex.org/W2801612845,"Adenylyl cyclases (ACs) catalyze the biosynthesis of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and play an important role in many signal transduction pathways. The enzymatic activity of ACs is carefully controlled by a variety of molecules, including G-protein subunits that can both stimulate and inhibit cAMP production. Using homology models developed from existing structural data, we have carried out all-atom, microsecond-scale molecular dynamics simulations on the AC5 isoform of adenylyl cyclase and on its complexes with ATP and with the stimulatory G-protein subunit Gsα. The results show that both ATP and Gsα binding have significant effects on the structure and flexibility of adenylyl cyclase. New data on ATP bound to AC5 in the absence of Gsα notably help to explain how Gsα binding enhances enzyme activity and could aid product release. Simulations also suggest a possible coupling between ATP binding and interactions with the inhibitory G-protein subunit Gαi."
https://openalex.org/W2801526604,"Background Understanding vaping patterns of electronic cigarette (EC) use is important to understand the real-life exposure to EC vapor. Long term information on vaping topography in relation to tobacco cigarette (TC) smoking cessation success has not been explored. Methods Observational non-blinded study where active TC smokers were asked to replace TC with EC over 4 weeks (replacement phase, RP) followed by exclusive EC use for an additional 12 weeks (maintenance phase, MP). TC use and EC compliance was monitored weekly. Subjects were classified as success or failure whether or not they completed the protocol. Vaping information was stored and downloaded directly from the EC device and averaged per calendar day for analysis. Results From 25 subjects that followed the protocol, sixteen succeeded in completing the RP and 8 the MP (32%). No significant differences in baseline characteristics were noted between subjects in the success and failure groups including markers of nicotine addiction, plasma cotinine levels or smoking history. Success subjects showed significantly longer puff duration (seconds per vape) and total overall vapor exposure (number of vapes x average vape duration or vape-seconds) in both study phases. Furthermore, subjects in the success group continued to increase the number of vapes, device voltage and wattage significantly as they transitioned into the MP. After an initial drop, subjects in the success group were able to regain plasma cotinine levels comparable to their TC use while subjects in the failure group could not. Cotinine levels significantly correlated with the average number of daily vapes and vapes-seconds, but not with other vaping parameters. Conclusion The topography of smokers who adhere to exclusive EC use reflects a progressive and dynamic device adaptation over weeks to maintain baseline cotinine levels. The higher inhaled volume over time should be considered when addressing the potential toxic effects of EC and the variable EC adherence when addressing public health policies regarding their use."

We report the first complete chloroplast genome sequence of C. humilis. Its genome is 158,084 bp in size, and the overall GC content is 36.8%. An inverted repeats (IR) of 52,672 bp in size is separated by a large single-copy (LSC) region of 86,374 bp and a small single-copy (SSC) region of 19,038 bp. The chloroplast genome of C. humilis contains 131 genes including 90 protein-coding genes, 33 transfer RNA genes, and 8 ribosomal RNA genes. The genome has a total 510 simple sequence repeats (SSRs). Of these, 306, 149, and 55 were found in the LSC, IR, and SSC regions, respectively. In addition, a comparison of the boundaries of the LSC, SSC, and IR regions of ten other Prunus species exhibited an overall high degree of sequence similarity, with slight variations in the IR boundary region which included gene deletions, insertions, expansions, and contractions. C. humilis lost the ycf1 gene at the IRA/SSC border and it has the largest ycf1 gene at the IRB/SSC border among these Prunus species, whereas the rps19 gene was inserted at the IRB/LSC junction. Furthermore, phylogenetic reconstruction using 61 conserved coding-protein genes clustered C. humilis with Prunus tomentosa. Thus, the complete chloroplast genome sequence of C. humilis provides a rich source of genetic information for studies on Prunus taxonomy, phylogeny, and evolution, as well as lays the foundation for further development and utilization of C. humilis."
https://openalex.org/W2799789253,"Mmi1 is an essential RNA-binding protein in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe that eliminates meiotic transcripts during normal vegetative growth. Mmi1 contains a YTH domain that binds specific RNA sequences, targeting mRNAs for degradation. The YTH domain of Mmi1 uses a noncanonical RNA-binding surface that includes contacts outside the conserved fold. Here, we report that an N-terminal extension that is proximal to the YTH domain enhances RNA binding. Using X-ray crystallography, NMR, and biophysical methods, we show that this low-complexity region becomes more ordered upon RNA binding. This enhances the affinity of the interaction of the Mmi1 YTH domain with specific RNAs by reducing the dissociation rate of the Mmi1-RNA complex. We propose that the low-complexity region influences RNA binding indirectly by reducing dynamic motions of the RNA-binding groove and stabilizing a conformation of the YTH domain that binds to RNA with high affinity. Taken together, our work reveals how a low-complexity region proximal to a conserved folded domain can adopt an ordered structure to aid nucleic acid binding."

Memoing was used to help bring concepts to higher abstract levels.The GPs' decision to participate in research was attributed to their inner drive and appreciation for primary care research and their confidence in managing their social and research environments. The drive and appreciation for research motivated the GPs to undergo research training to enhance their research knowledge, skills and confidence. However, the critical step in the GPs' decision to participate in research was their ability to align their research agenda with priorities in their social environment, which included personal life goals, clinical practice and organisational culture. Perceived support for research, such as funding and technical expertise, facilitated the GPs' participation in research. In addition, prior experiences participating in research also influenced the GPs' confidence in taking part in future research.The key to GPs deciding to participate in research is whether the research agenda aligns with the priorities in their social environment. Therefore, research training is important, but should be included in further measures and should comply with GPs' social environments and research support."
https://openalex.org/W2799474586,"Successfully applying theoretical models to natural communities and predicting ecosystem behavior under changing conditions is the backbone of predictive ecology. However, the experiments required to test these models are dictated by practical constraints, and models are often opportunistically validated against data for which they were never intended. Alternatively, we can inform and improve experimental design by an in-depth pre-experimental analysis of the model, generating experiments better targeted at testing the validity of a theory. Here, we describe this process for a specific experiment. Starting from food web ecological theory, we formulate a model and design an experiment to optimally test the validity of the theory, supplementing traditional design considerations with model analysis. The experiment itself will be run and described in a separate paper. The theory we test is that trophic population dynamics are dictated by species traits, and we study this in a community of terrestrial arthropods. We depart from the Allometric Trophic Network (ATN) model and hypothesize that including habitat use, in addition to body mass, is necessary to better model trophic interactions. We therefore formulate new terms which account for micro-habitat use as well as intra- and interspecific interference in the ATN model. We design an experiment and an effective sampling regime to test this model and the underlying assumptions about the traits dominating trophic interactions. We arrive at a detailed sampling protocol to maximize information content in the empirical data obtained from the experiment and, relying on theoretical analysis of the proposed model, explore potential shortcomings of our design. Consequently, since this is a ""pre-experimental"" exercise aimed at improving the links between hypothesis formulation, model construction, experimental design and data collection, we hasten to publish our findings before analyzing data from the actual experiment, thus setting the stage for strong inference."

https://openalex.org/W2803064139,"The macaque is widely accepted as a suitable model for preclinical characterization of dengue vaccine candidates. However, the only vaccine for which both preclinical and clinical efficacy results were reported so far showed efficacy levels that were substantially different between macaques and humans. We hypothesized that this model's predictive capacity may be improved using recent and minimally passaged dengue virus isolates, and by assessing vaccine efficacy by characterizing not only the post-dengue virus challenge viremia/RNAemia but also the associated-cytokine profile. Ten recent and minimally passaged Brazilian clinical isolates from the four dengue virus serotypes were tested for their infectivity in rhesus macaques. For the strains showing robust replication capacity, the associated-changes in soluble mediator levels, and the elicited dengue virus-neutralizing antibody responses, were also characterized. Three isolates from dengue virus serotypes 1, 2 and 4 induced viremia of high magnitude and longer duration relative to previously reported viremia kinetics in this model, and robust dengue virus-neutralizing antibody responses. Consistent with observations in humans, increased MCP-1, IFN-γ and VEGF-A levels, and transiently decreased IL-8 levels were detected after infection with the selected isolates. These results may contribute to establishing a dengue macaque model showing a higher predictability for vaccine efficacy in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2518298544,"Background Social support has been identified as a significant factor in facilitating better health outcomes following injury. However, research has primarily focused on the role of social support from the perspective of the person experiencing an injury. Limited research has examined the experiences of the family members and friends of a person with injury. This study aims to explore the perceptions and experiences of social support and recovery following a transport-related musculoskeletal injury (MSI) in a population of injured persons and their family members and friends. Methods This study was conducted using a phenomenological qualitative research design. In-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with ten persons with MSI, recruited via the Transport Accident Commission (TAC) in Victoria, Australia. Seven family members and friends were also interviewed. The data was analysed using constant comparative method and thematic analysis. Results Several themes were identified including: (1) key sources and types of support received, (2) relationship development and (3) challenges of providing and receiving support. Participants with MSI reported stories about how the social network provided emotional and tangible support. Family members and friends confirmed the supportive acts provided to the participants with MSI. Positive iterative changes in relationships were reported by the participants with MSI. Participants with MSI, their family members and friends described several difficulties including loss of independence, feeling like a burden, and the impact of caring on health and well-being. Conclusions The role of social support is complex given the multitude of people involved in the recovery process. The findings of this study suggest that persons with MSI may benefit from support groups and maintenance of existing support networks. Furthermore, family members and friends engaged in the recovery process may benefit from support in this role."
https://openalex.org/W2801289804,"Background Body fatness is associated with risk of coronary heart disease and it has been postulated that epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) may have a particularly detrimental effect because of its localized toxic effects. We therefore aimed to examine the association between EAT and coronary artery calcification and compared this with associations for visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and other regional fat depots. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study of 487 Chinese participants aged 50 years old and above, living in Singapore. Participants, free from known diabetes mellitus and coronary heart diseases, completed interviews, a health screening to evaluate obesity and cardiovascular disease risk factors, and computed tomography scans of the abdomen and coronary arteries. Associations between regional fat depots and subclinical atherosclerosis defined as CAC> = 100 were determined by multiple logistic regression analysis. Results Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) was highly correlated with visceral adipose tissue (VAT) (Pearson r = 0.72) and trunk fat mass (r = 0.66). The age and sex-adjusted odd ratio (OR) (in 1-SD increase) of subclinical atherosclerosis was 1.28 (1.01–1.61) for EAT and 1.40 (1.04–1.88) for VAT. These associations were weaker and non-significant after adjusting for markers of dyslipidemia and hyperglycemia. Total body fat, subcutaneous abdominal fat, and leg, arm and trunk fat mass were not significantly associated with atherosclerosis. Conclusion VAT and EAT showed similar associations with coronary artery calcification and the associations could be mediated by traditional risk factors in this ethnic Chinese population."
https://openalex.org/W2799658862,"Disturbances in one-carbon metabolism, intracellular reactions involved in nucleotide synthesis and methylation, likely increase the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). However, results have been inconsistent. To explore whether this inconsistency could be explained by intertumoral heterogeneity, we evaluated a comprehensive panel of one-carbon metabolism biomarkers and some single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in relation to the risk of molecular subtypes of CRC defined by mutations in the KRAS and BRAF oncogenes. This nested case-control study included 488 CRC cases and 947 matched controls from two population-based cohorts in the Northern Sweden Health and Disease Study. We analyzed 14 biomarkers and 17 SNPs in prediagnostic blood and determined KRAS and BRAF mutation status in tumor tissue. In a multivariate network analysis, no variable displayed a strong association with the risk of specific CRC subtypes. A non-synonymous SNP in the CTH gene, rs1021737, had a stronger association compared with other variables. In subsequent univariate analyses, participants with variant rs1021737 genotype had a decreased risk of KRAS-mutated CRC (OR per allele = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.50, 1.05), and an increased risk of BRAF-mutated CRC (OR per allele = 1.56, 95% CI = 1.07, 2.30), with weak evidence for heterogeneity (Pheterogeneity = 0.01). This subtype-specific SNP association was not replicated in a case-case analysis of 533 CRC cases from The Cancer Genome Atlas (P = 0.85). In conclusion, we found no support for clear subtype-specific roles of one-carbon metabolism biomarkers and SNPs in CRC development, making differences in CRC molecular subtype distributions an unlikely explanation for the varying results on the role of one-carbon metabolism in CRC development across previous studies. Further investigation of the CTH gene in colorectal carcinogenesis with regards to KRAS and BRAF mutations or other molecular characteristics of the tumor may be warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2800259802,"Bilateral sagittal split osteotomy (BSSO) is a widely-performed procedure in orthognathic surgery for the correction of dentofacial deformity. Condylar positioning is a critical step during BSSO to maximize functional and morphological results. The unsuitable positioning of condyles represents one of the causative mechanisms that may induce temporomandibular joint noxious effects after BSSO. Repositioning devices can assist surgeons in maintaining the preoperative condylar position; however, empirical repositioning methods based on experience gained are still commonly used. Trainee learning curves are difficult to assess. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relevance of computer-assisted surgery in the acquisition of condylar positioning skills. Forty-eight patients underwent BSSO performed by six maxillofacial trainees (four junior residents and two senior experienced residents). A condyle positioning system (CPS) was used by a senior surgeon to record a condylar position score during the procedure. Firstly, scores were recorded when the trainee manually positioned the condyle without access to the CPS score (phase 1) and then when the trainee positioned the condyle and performed osteosynthesis with visual access to the CPS score (phase 2). Six parameters describing condylar three-dimensional motions were assessed: translational motion from top to bottom (TB), back to front (BF), and left to right (LR), axial rotation (AR), sagittal rotation (SR), frontal rotation (FR), and a total score (TS). There were no significant differences between junior and senior residents in condyle positioning without access to the CPS. Condyles were significantly better positioned during phase 2 with access to the CPS (p<0.001). Over time, use of the CPS (phase 2) produced significantly quicker improvements in scores (p = 0.042). For those teaching surgeries to trainees, computer-assisted devices can potentially result in more rapid learning curves than traditional ""observations-imitation"" models. Use of a CPS by trainees facilitated condylar repositioning that resulted in an accurate occlusal result and avoidance of adverse effects on the temporomandibular joint."
https://openalex.org/W2801981469,"Heme-binding proteins constitute a large family of catalytic and transport proteins. Their widespread presence as globins and as essential oxygen and electron transporters, along with their diverse enzymatic functions, have made them targets for protein design. Most previously reported designs involved the use of α-helical scaffolds, and natural peptides also exhibit a strong preference for these scaffolds. However, the reason for this preference is not well-understood, in part because alternative protein designs, such as those with β-sheets or hairpins, are challenging to perform. Here, we report the computational design and experimental validation of a water-soluble heme-binding peptide, Pincer-1, composed of predominantly β-scaffold secondary structures. Such heme-binding proteins are rarely observed in nature, and by designing such a scaffold, we simultaneously increase the known fold space of heme-binding proteins and expand the limits of computational design methods. For a β-scaffold, two tryptophan zipper β-hairpins sandwiching a heme molecule were linked through an N-terminal cysteine disulfide bond. β-Hairpin orientations and residue selection were performed computationally. Heme binding was confirmed through absorbance experiments and surface plasmon resonance experiments (KD = 730 ± 160 nm). CD and NMR experiments validated the β-hairpin topology of the designed peptide. Our results indicate that a helical scaffold is not essential for heme binding and reveal the first designed water-soluble, heme-binding β-hairpin peptide. This peptide could help expand the search for and design space to cytoplasmic heme-binding proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2801668338,"The GTPase RhoA is a major player in many different regulatory pathways. RhoA catalyzes GTP hydrolysis, and its catalysis is accelerated when RhoA forms heterodimers with proteins of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) family. Neuroepithelial cell transforming gene 1 (Net1) is a RhoA-interacting GEF implicated in cancer, but the structural features supporting the RhoA/Net1 interaction are unknown. Taking advantage of a simple production and purification process, here we solved the structure of a RhoA/Net1 heterodimer with X-ray crystallography at 2-A resolution. Using a panel of several techniques, including molecular dynamics simulations, we characterized the RhoA/Net1 interface. Moreover, deploying an extremely simple peptide-based scanning approach, we found that short peptides (penta- to nonapeptides) derived from the protein/protein interaction region of RhoA could disrupt the RhoA/Net1 interaction and thereby diminish the rate of nucleotide exchange. The most inhibitory peptide, EVKHF, spanning residues 102-106 in the RhoA sequence, displayed an IC50 of ∼100 μm without further modifications. The peptides identified here could be useful in further investigations of the RhoA/Net1 interaction region. We propose that our structural and functional insights might inform chemical approaches for transforming the pentapeptide into an optimized pseudopeptide that antagonizes Net1-mediated RhoA activation with therapeutic anticancer potential."
https://openalex.org/W4238276476,"Freshwater reservoir offsets (FROs) occur when AMS dates on charred, encrusted food residues on pottery predate a pot’s chronological context because of the presence of ancient carbon from aquatic resources such as fish. Research over the past two decades has demonstrated that FROs vary widely within and between water bodies and between fish in those water bodies. Lipid analyses have identified aquatic biomarkers that can be extracted from cooking residues as potential evidence for FROs. However, lacking has been efforts to determine empirically how much fish with FROs needs to be cooked in a pot with other resources to result in significant FRO on encrusted cooking residue and what percentage of fish C in a residue is needed to result in the recovery of aquatic biomarkers. Here we provide preliminary assessments of both issues. Our results indicate that in historically-contingent, high alkalinity environments <20% C from fish may result in a statistically significant FRO, but that biomarkers for aquatic resources may be present in the absence of a significant FRO."
